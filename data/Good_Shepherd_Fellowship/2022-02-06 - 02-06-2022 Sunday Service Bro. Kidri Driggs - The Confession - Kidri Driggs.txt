we want to thank you and thank god for your life and the lord kind of for saving from a horrible accident good to see the children and his wife and uh we thank the lord for his faithfulness amen praise the lord praise the lord amen uh wednesday night i i gave an assignment i don't know who are looking to thy assignment praise the lord we were talking on [Music] out to your fight and reading from pd we [Music] spoke about poor ministry of grace and [Music] so i don't know who all had the opportunity to look at grace through the episode of of paul because we said paul used it he was the one that most used that praise the lord we read from peter and peter used that in second period in his greeting and if you did the assignment you know exactly what i'm talking about if you didn't do it then may god help you to do it amen but first john also use it in his uh i mean john used it uh uh in second john where he said grace be with you mercy and peace from god our father so in in the terms of of greetings in the way that paul used it so we realized that peter used it once as a greeting and john used it but you find it all true paul writing praise the lord romans chapter 1 verse 7 paul says and uh and to all that be in rome beloved of god called to be sins grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord and he will close the roman letter chapter 16 verse 24 and the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen first corinthians chapter 1 3 grace be unto you and peace from god the father praise the lord amen first corinthians 16 he will close that letter the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you second corinthians chapter one verse two grace be unto you and peace from god you look through all paul letter you will see there he started with that and he closed with the same praise the lord now if you if you taught you heard me saying paul was the only one that used the word grace then you did not hear what i said praise the lord if you thought that what you heard then you did not hear what i say 2nd corinthians chapter 1 verse 2 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ amen second corinthian chapter 13 verse 14 the grace of our lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all galilean chapter 1 verse 3 grace be unto you in peace and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ praise the lord amen and he closed the galatian letter chapter 6 verse 18 brethren is the grace of our lord jesus has been with you so you see that all true all through paul leather he had the ministry of grace this morning i was listening to the message of grace and and there are some things that paul says there but when you get over to the book of hebrew you'll realize that he did not greeted the church like that from the beginning because he disguised himself because he never wanted his letter to be resented by the jewish believers but in chapter 13 he closes it with that greeting grace be with you all amen praise the lord amen so we thank the lord for the grace of god this morning amen amen you appreciate the grace of god in your life amen it's by grace that we are saved amen is by grace that we are saving and now that ourselves i'm sure i was giving a uh a prayer request here the note of pain so so god bless you church i just wanted to thank to thank god for everything he's been doing in my life and what he's doing now in my life and my family also keep my brother in prayer god bless you praise the lord so this is a note of things from somebody that is uh thanking god for what he's doing in their life and he's continuing to do and they want to keep their brother in prayer so we will definitely remember that and we had a thought on our mind to [Music] praise the lord [Music] you know i talked i told black dicks when i pick him up i said i said i slept last night i said if i was the one that preached i was so tired but you know it's it is it is that thing when when when the ministry comes and and and you know and and put their shoulder on on under the burden you know that it's on your heart you know uh i mean as as you know we don't invite these brothers because we just run out of what to preach or we don't have nothing to preach or we don't have people to preach to us but we just we we do that because we feed some sense of leadership to bring in you know diversities of gift and also that's the way that as a pastor i hear from the lord you know yeah and i had the opportunity to be preached also so uh so we thank the lord for the service last night praise the lord and uh so with that being said i hope i'm not missing something on my mind praise the lord amen let your stand to our faith [Music] do we have the song back there the when the ocean rise uh be still and know that i'm gone i don't know what you were playing but it looks like i heard that in that so i would be stale i would be still and know that you are god [Music] [Music] [Music] when the ocean rises [Music] i will saw it here above the stars know that you are the road i will soar with you above the start father you i came over the floor [Music] know that let's sing that one more time oh when the ocean rises [Music] above the sun [Music] [Music] i [Music] i will be still [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's try the verse now [Music] your way cover me within your mighty hand [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i will be still [Music] rest my soul [Music] in christ [Music] is [Music] i will be still know that you i got i will be still and know that [Music] [Music] [Music] i will be still know that you i got i will be still you i got oh hallelujah let's give the lord a hand of praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] well let's call the preacher but these will come it is grace grace to serve the lord amen let's sing that chorus and the preacher will come amen it is

[Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] grace [Music] time [Music] [Music] is [Music] i mean to receive his grace we receive the grace of the lord today amen we're certainly enjoying jesus amen you know i've said this before and i i say it again i can't understand why a person would want to serve the lord amen there's so many wonderful benefits but to know that he's close to know he's near that just separates everything you know and it's grace to serve the lord you know you know grace's unmerited favor we don't deserve it that's right but he gave it to us anyway so it's it's great to serve the lord you know we just thank god for being here appreciate all of you that come out we pray that the lord will have his his way with us today we appreciate all the songs that song of zion definitely appreciate brother juan amen wonderful brother and man of god we appreciate him in his labor let's just pray and we'll get into the word of god lord jesus father we love you today you know as the song says it's grace to serve you lord father knowing that there's nothing we have done lord is all by your election it's all by your choosing so lord we pray that as we hear this morning lord that it's not our thoughts we want to take on the thoughts of the lord jesus christ lord we want to receive the word on good ground lord and let it do what you send it out to accomplish lord lord we just ask father god that you just search our hearts lord if you find anything that shouldn't be lord you will replace it and put something new and refreshing there of thy spirit lord god look look into your people lord and and express lord that dire need in which we need to be closer to thee lord most of all father forgive us for anything that's not like you lord keep us under your atoning blood in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray we pray and we thank you the church say amen amen if you have your bibles amen let's turn to um um hebrews chapter four [Music] hebrews chapter four and we'll we'll come we'll we'll read that next let's go to romans 10. romans chapter 10 romans chapter 10. let's start at verse 8. romans 10 verse 8. if you have a say amen i mean the bible says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shall confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation and let's go to hebrews chapter four hebrews chapter four let's read verse uh 14. hebrews 4 and 14. the bible says seeing then that we have a great high priest that is past into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not in high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need amen may the lord bless you of his word you can have your seats amen if you don't mind let's turn over to joshua chapter 1. joshua chapter 1. before i read this i want to give you my thought and my my my uh my thought this morning by the grace of god is honest confession honest confession you know uh a lot of times when we think of confession we think of the wrong that we've done but confession means to declare over yourself you know so you have to ask yourself what are you confessing this morning you know there there's a uh before we read joshua there's a place in the scriptures where jesus was on the cross and you know when they were debating uh i believe it was pilate o'hara one of the two at the time they were debating should christ be crucified because they really didn't have any any any reason to crucify him so he went i believe it was power he went to the people and he was basically saying what should i do with this jesus you know and the people were saying crucify him and his response was why he's done nothing wrong you know the life of christ it was pretty much blameless amen they had he had nothing to confess for but just giving his life that others may be better hallelujah so in that moment the people they cried crucify him and as him jesus being a just man hallelujah he who knew no sin became sin he became our sin hallelujah so that we could become his righteousness but look at the people the people said crucify him and then uh pilate he says uh but the man has done no wrong and then they come back and they say let his blood be on us and our children that was their confession hell yeah and they didn't even realize hallelujah they said hurry that just i want you to catch the day my my my subject i'm dealing with confession amen and the power of confession and you know they said let his blood be on us and our children but they didn't stop there they said give us barabbas that's what they said they said give us that criminal that's who we confess over ourselves in this moment they didn't confess they didn't confess the love of the mighty one they didn't confess the grace of god into their lives they didn't confess the mercy of jesus christ all the things that god had did until that time church until that time that he was on the cross he healed the sick he raised the dead he brought back joy he gave them the word he did all these things but the people's confession was give us barabbas [Music] they have the wrong confession and they didn't even realize the very thing they asked for was going to come upon their lives [Music] think if they would have said give me jesus hallelujah church i tell you today if that's your confession give me jesus there's a lot that comes along with that but their confession hallelujah they said let his blood be on us and our children and they spoke as jews the nation of the jews they say let his blood be on us and our children therefore came something called a holocaust why because they asked for it they asked for it see one thing about god one thing we got to pre appreciate about our lord he's going to give you what you asked for hallelujah amen see god is not in the business of making you do anything you don't want god is a lover hallelujah he wants us to fall in love with him hallelujah he don't want to make us serve him or anything and you think about a church he could have did it he could have made everybody in that at that time fall down and worship him when he was on the cross he said don't you know i could call a legion of angels and be set free right now but he gave his life hallelujah he gave his life for us so that we could confess christ over every situation in our life hallelujah look church before i go any further let's go back to romans put romans 10 back up on the stream hallelujah because some of these scriptures i want you to see that they're not just the words of a preacher today but these are the words of christ our savior look let's let's let's read uh go back the first uh verse um let's start at verse eight go back to verse eight romans ten verse eight yeah right there amen it says but what says it the word is naive even in thy mouth and what is the word christ is the word holy in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and what happened to that word that word became fresh hallelujah so now god is putting the word where it's supposed to be he said the word should be where in your mouth you should be confessing the right kind of word amen it's too often we go through things and we say oh the devil oh the devil does and the devil that we're supposed to be confessing the word of god [Music] hallelujah what is your confession over your life what is your confession over your trials and tribulation let me tell you something there's nothing you can go through except first god allows it god created the devil hallelujah for a purpose to challenge his word see god had god had to create a tool that was going to bring the best of him out so god created satan used it for the devil the dragon whatever you want to call him to challenge what his word knowing he can't stop it why because the scripture says heavens and earth shall pass away but my word my word what what about that word [Music] what what was that word [Music] it forever [Music] so which would you rather have heaven or earth or the word amen i'd rather have the word because heavens and earth would pass away but my word remains and do it forever [Music] so i want you to think about this morning as we preach and as we go forward examine your life and think about what you need to confess right now if you're sick i got a confession for you by his stripes you are healed amen see god got a word for anything you need you say brother jesus i've been on this journey a long time and you know i get discouraged i got a word for you the joy of the lord is my strength you say well brother jesus i've been going through something a long long time and i just ain't seen my prayers answer yet i got a word for you he said dave that way on the lord said remove this thing what are you confessing [Applause] [Music] the prophet of god how are you talking about confession confession means to declare what's already been declared oh yeah so when i confess i confess what god says about me [Music] because anything other than the word is a perversion are you with me church amen and you know what the enemy does even like now we got things in our life that we need to confess and the devil will tell you you better not tell nobody that you better hold on to that you're going to be found out well let me tell you i got a word for you right now i want to be found out hallelujah amen i want god to know everything about me hallelujah amen because when god knows everything about me i become hallelujah blameless [Applause] see our problem is church there's too many of us we're walking around with spiritual weights on our shoulders things that we're carrying hallelujah i got a word for you he says take my burden he says my yoke is easy my burden is light hallelujah what are you confessing amen you need a job he says my burden he said my yoke he said give it to me i'll take it hurry up confess these things unto god see we're no good without our helper hallelujah y'all think i'm up here preaching on my own ability no it's the gift of god but what i must do i must confess before the lord that i am nothing lord and i need your help hallelujah church we all fall in that category i'm no better than you but if you're looking at me and you're thinking hallelujah well how does he get there why is he there let me tell you i've confessed my wrongs to god [Music] amen then god can use you because the only way he can touch you is when you become blameless because he's a holy god and god's not going to put his heart his name on anything that's going to take his reputation [Music] and even when you may find yourself in sin god will give you an opportunity to confess the right thing remember the woman that they accused of adultery hallelujah and jesus told him he said okay now i want y'all to confess y'all can y'all can see her y'all can see what she did she was caught in the act okay jesus never denied that he never denied that she did it but he said let's look at this thing for what it is let's look at the real confession he said now yeah she was caught in it but he looked at them he said now i want to see what y'all can confess y'all know her wrongs he said but if any of you be without sin they were willing to show somebody else's realms when they had things in their hearts they had confessed [Music] they had things in their life that they hadn't confessed because jesus said if any of you be without sin cast the first though and the bible said from the greatest to the least walked away hallelujah why because they had things in their life that they hadn't confessed even though they was trying to condemn somebody else oh my and then this very woman who was condemned jesus said woman where are thy accusers where are your accusers oh yeah hey and then she said you know in a place of scripture he says if there's no one accuse you he says neither do i why because your confession is right once you come under the blood hallelujah you cannot be condemned for anything when you come under the blood there's nothing to condemn you why because the blood of jesus makes everything come to a standstill hallelujah church put it back up there bro sister whoever back there today i'll fail over there all right you're with me jordan amen he says but what says it the word is naive even in thy mouth and in thy heart see the word is not just supposed to be in your mouth but whatever you say you supposed to believe it hallelujah church when i asked god to forgive me for my sins i believe he could do hell yeah in church that's how you enter into a real confession when you believe what's your confession to him once you confess that to god he begins to change your desire hallelujah under the old testament covenant hallelujah they would confess their wrongs but the desire will stay there hallelujah the desire will stay there why because they could not connect with the sacrifice they could confess it with their mouth but there was nothing there to change their hearts but when jesus came here when jesus came he changed the dynamics of confession hallelujah when jesus came he changed the dynamics of what come out of your mouth confession and repentance when jesus came he took your confession and he wiped the straight [Applause] [Music] clean not only did he just take it out of your mouth but did he begin to change your heart that's why scriptures come into play that says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so if you confess something out of your mouth and you believe it in your heart that's what you become oh yeah that's why i confess myself to be a christian holy because christian means christ like hallelujah that's what i confess but look church he says he says in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith so when you confess it out of your mouth and you believe it in your heart it turns into the word of faith and the bible says faith is the what see i can say holy there are bibles out in the world hallelujah but when i hold it in my hand i got the substance holy i got the manifestation of what came out of my mouth hallelujah in church what he's saying right here hallelujah when the word travels from just the mouth to the heart hallelujah and you come through a change honestly it begins to move in a realm of faith honey which we preach amen and the scripture says amen hello that through the foolishness of god of of preaching people became saved [Music] the word of god hallelujah began to change the hearts of the people amen so church if we believe the word earlier if let's say like this if we speak the word believe the word it becomes a channel of faith to produce what you spoke see i almost titled this almost titled this message today harlow say what you heard so you can see what you said whoa that's what we want with our confession holly god threw a vindicated prophet he came and he he spoke to us about divine healing and all these things our our profession and confession and all these things and the spoken word authority all of that perfect faith perfect love all the things that have been restored to the church and then he comes and he says everything that adam lost has been restored and who jesus christ whoa church i'm trying to show you how powerful the confession of christ is over your life amen next verse brother he says that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth we're back there again amen we're still dealing with saying the right thing out of your mouth that if thou will confess out of our mouth what the lord jesus hallelujah and shall believe in thy heart there we go again oh what are we confessing the lord jesus hallelujah i hope you're catching this we're confessing the lord jesus christ why jesus amen let's go to matthew 28 matthew 28 why don't we confess jesus put that out there for me bro matthew 28 verse 14. no no 18. matthew 28 18. for all you people in here that may not be saved today i'm going to show you what you're missing out on holly all you people that may just come to church on a sunday thinking you know i got to do my duty everybody go to church on sunday that's not why we're here hallelujah we're here because god he talks to us he speaks to us amen he gives us direction and leadership that's why we're here we bring all our burdens to the lord and we leave them there honey somebody in here today needs to confess the right thing and be delivered [Music] holy romans 10 says if thou shalt confess the lord jesus hallelujah as your savior thou shalt be saved hallelujah why do we confess the lord jesus i'll tell you why look at this he said and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah i'm not confessing a buddha i'm not confessing to allah i'm not confessing to beyonce or cardi b or taylor swift or lebron james [Music] hallelujah i'm not confessing a little baby a dumb baby a little dirt no i'm not confessing none of that oh yeah why because they ain't got what jesus got [Music] he let the whole world know right now he says all power is given up to me in heaven hallelujah church everything belongs to him so when you confess the lord jesus christ you're putting all power you're putting all power over that situation there's nothing the devil can do if you're not quite sure should you confess let me go back and say it again that one we're talking about jesus he created the devil [Applause] [Music] and i gotta tell him brother ariel i was telling brother harry and others hey holly think about jesus jesus created his enemy with a desire to want to be him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] got your money oh my normally your enemy can't stand you but satan wanted to be just like god amen and he'll come and tell you don't confess don't get it right when he wouldn't want to be like god he wants your place amen church the bible says the bible says that satan wanted to be like the most high [Applause] hallelujah church he saw all that god was the church and even the devil started confessing he looking at it in heaven he start confessing he started to say i want to be like the most high i'm going to have a church i'm going to have a race i'm going to just i'm going to that all the stuff you saw in christ he desired it and he started confessing it over himself [Applause] but it wasn't given unto him to be just like christ yet he had a desire he couldn't fulfill but us hallelujah but us when we make the fashion like christ to be like christ we can achieve it hallelujah amen he says hungary if you abide in me and i ain't you ask what you will he said father make them one as we are one what is your confession hallelujah oh my church think about that if the devil desires to be like god what about you [Applause] oh my oh we are blessed people hey look let's go back to that church put it back up there jordan amen he says i'm sorry if i'm getting the names wrong whoever working it but he says look if you're wondering hollywood should you get saved should you give your life this is the number one reason holy because our god is all powerful you say brothers i got a problem with smoking he can take care of it you can't put a smoke down huh well let me tell you something i got a word that can deliver you from smoking jesus [Music] hallelujah jesus can do it hallelujah church one day i was in one day i was in service hallelujah i was in a portland amen and her sister came up and look she looked just like an angel like some of y'all look hungry she was dressed right and everything she came in the line and she started confessing her husband came up holding hands and she said brother diggs i just heard the word of god and i want to make it right with god she said i've been smoking marijuana for the past 10 years why is she going to church why she's hearing the word of god she got this weight on her hallelujah and a husband sitting there holding a hand and he says well brother she's been using it medically i wanted to lay hands on him so bad the woman is trying to get the burden off of her and give it to christ and he's making excuses she knows he's abusing it hallelujah but he sitting there trying to make excuses she's using i said brother be quiet let her talk let her talk to god somebody need to shut up [Music] stop judging people and shut up and let god have his way so what you know about they sin if they bring in to god if god can forgive them who are you to condemn them [Music] [Applause] hallelujah churchill she comes up and she confesses hallelujah and she begins to say that she's been using it for 10 years and he comes and says well brother well she's been using it medically and i want to say man if you don't get out of here i'ma cast the devil out of you so fast we're not here to make excuses for our sins [Music] look we know when we're abusing something we know when the devil is taking that thing into a place where we know it's no longer god hallelujah amen you know if you got something you need to confess unto god don't walk out of here with that weight on yourself that's right hallelujah look don't mistake what kind of service this is this is not a point you out service this is a deliverance it's a deliverance because when you confess when you confess let me show you what happened when you confess satan loses his grip he has he can't touch you no more why because there's something in between you now what is it it's that jesus holy that all power in heaven and on earth he said hollow be thy name oh my church and she said well brother i've been doing this for so long and i don't want to do it no more i said well sis if that's your confession let's pray about it and we prayed right there in the line holly she didn't kick she didn't haul she didn't scream she just said thank you and from that moment she never had another desire for it in her life [Applause] why are we telling about this because some of y'all smoking talking about it's medicinal well let's break it down and i ain't spending too much time in this let's break it down that marijuana you smoking it it doesn't come from a plant it comes from a laboratory it's being man-made man treated hallelujah and they putting stuff in it they helped to keep you addicted when your body begins to crave it more honey and you'll never be able to get off of it why because there's something in it that makes you crave it hallelujah and that's what they're doing that's why they're making it legal why i'ma leave that alone now it's up to you whether you want to be delivered or not hallelujah church it's just that simple you just bring it to god give it to god and god deal with it amen it's not there's no power in me there's no power no man there's power in what his word what i do amen a lot of times when i'm going through stuff i bring god back to the scripture i say lord you said that's right [Music] i'm gonna encourage myself again brother one lord you said amen if i bring to yosto house first lord you said if i give my tithe an offering you said prove you and see if you won't open the windows of heaven now i didn't did my part god i wait no you that's my confession hallelujah okay so now the reason why we confess the lord jesus you know why because jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth hardly and you know church hallelujah in in revelation john began to weep and then john's an angel came to john and he said weep not hardly for the lion the tribe of judah has prevailed who was he talking about like he said no one on the earth was worthy no one in the earth was worthy no one under the earth was worthy but there's a lamb hallelujah a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world and all power in heaven and earth is given unto him let's say his name jesus [Music] [Applause] hallelujah let's say his name jesus we're gonna break some yokes this morning let's say his name jesus [Applause] [Music] there is power in the name of jesus [Applause] there is hearing in the name of jesus deliverance in the name of jesus [Applause] if you've lost your joy there is joy in the name of jesus so i confess the name of jesus over my situation don't get nervous nobody close somebody close look at nervous church we are here because we serve a god that can't be defeated [Music] see the way confession works once you give it to him it's no longer yours oh my you say oh lord lord please take this pornography out my life i confess the lord jesus over the situation it's no longer yours hallelujah and god is a protector of his word whether you realize it or not he'll protect hallelujah his word in every situation remember god said to abraham he said hey you you and sarah gonna have a son hello amen that was god's confession amen now abra abraham his body hallelujah was old and stricken in age sarah her body was the same way and the prophet of god said she was way beyond the years of childbearing hardly but what what that got to do with the word once it comes out of god's mouth it's just as sure going to happen hallelujah hallelujah and with church one thing i want you to realize when angels come they come as messengers hallelujah messengers of what god says that's right so when the angel came to abraham they were basically saying let me tell you what god say when they came to uh isaiah or jeremiah whoever they came to it was god they was expressing what god said they were only confessing what god told them hallelujah they were declaring and professing what god is saying amen but you look church he says hey man he tells abraham you and sarah gonna have a child you know and sarah didn't quite get it she was like he must mean him and hagar so i'm gonna give a hang on no that wasn't what he said he said you and sarah hallelujah if god gave me a promise i ain't looking for it to happen in anybody else's life i want my turn hallelujah i want the lord to give me what he promised me amen church and then they get to a place where they begin to walk they made the confession they began to walk but then it had to be something real in their hearts and abraham gets to a place where he has sarah and they're walking down the king of bimbalek sees them holly young king he sees grandma and grandpa coming up holly and they couldn't even recognize that they're being changed right before the people the word of god will change you right before the people and you may not even recognize it if you're in the wrong realm abraham look church he was so caught up and you know what there's a word i want to bind this morning there's a spirit i want to bind this morning that's been moving all over the church hallelujah and it's in here this morning and i want to cast it out honey there's a word we use to describe what we're going through and it's called my anxiety oh my my anxiety i just can't get over this because my anxiety i'm nervous and i'm stressing my anxiety anxiety is no more than a spirit called fear if you confess anxiety over you you're giving the devil a space in your life hurry up what you have to say is god is not giving me the spirit of faith [Music] got no anxiety i'm trusting in the law church and you look they come the king sees sarah and abraham and the king he starts looking at sarah he's like day boy grandma fine yeah where is she looking good 90 years old [Music] who won't say god can't restore something 90 years old hallelujah how many of you young brothers here looking for a 90 year old woman they looking at me like man you got to be crazy 90 year old christian say you believe the word but you believe it that much [Music] church the king looking at her and he said man i got to have her and then here comes abraham his anxiety and he says hey you're my sister when they come and approach you you're my sister why did he have anxiety because he was scared for his own life he wasn't afraid for his wife he was afraid for his own life selfish church and then he says he says hey you're my sister and and actually they were brothers and sisters you know that's why i tell some of you young brothers girls be in your church that you can look for the marriage but you want to go way to africa somewhere young girls already being raised listen to the same words you're listening to and you go away to new zealand somewhere you go away to panama zoo with a girl getting the same words you gettin and then brother juan they use this old lame excuse well she like my sister i can't really i can't really get she like my sister well let me tell you something abraham married his sister [Applause] whoo and abraham is the father of faith don't get me wrong i ain't talking about my own incense i'm talking about you brother be looking for some way over like my parents say sometimes god put stuff right in our face and we overreach oh my god i need to go to london [Music] you need to sit down and pray god got a rainbow trout right in your pond [Music] probably oh man let me leave that alone that's for your pastor let me leave that alone but church look now he's everybody all right you know now he sees the king sees sarah he's like oh my i got to have her and then he goes and take her and then both of them they offer up the same confession yeah we brothers we sister that was the wrong confession but church even in our own god will protect his word [Music] because what is he protecting he's protecting his promise he's protecting what he confessed over you hallelujah see god told abraham and sarah that you're going to bring forth the child hollering so when they got off the path god had to protect what he said hallelujah so god comes down hallelujah and comes to abimelech in the dream and says hey if you don't give a back you're as good as a dead man oh yeah god came down to protect his word even when sarah and abraham got off the path hallelujah then god comes back and puts everything back in his proper position and he says hey king how to restore that woman to her husband holy and this is what i want you to do i want you to go get prayer from that liar [Applause] god don't mind whoa oh my whoa you look at me you may judge me but if god puts it under the blood what you gonna do about it god put abraham and sarah's wrongs under the blood he said now i will you you're going to let my lying prophet pray for you that your kingdom be spared and the bible says the bible says when the people like approach god he says lord you know the integrity of my heart i've done nothing wrong he said yeah and because of your integrity i'ma stop you before you do something oh my church that's our god he wants us to have the right confession amen but look let's go uh i said joshua chapter one let's go to joshua chapter one oh my i ain't gonna be too much longer because you know there was a time with a prophet he would preach two and three hours but then god came and he told me say he wanted him to trim it back why he said because after the word is preached he wanted to give the people enough time to be dealt with by god hallelujah so it wasn't that he was just cutting the service short no after the word is preached then it is time for manifestation hallelujah so he was giving the people a chance to react hallelujah or receive what they heard hollywood going from the mind to the heart to a walk of faith hallelujah that's what the confession of jesus christ is it goes from the mouth hallelujah to the heart and then it becomes a walk of faith hallelujah joshua now what are we dealing with confession you know what it's so much coming to me right now hold that hold that spot i'm gonna read you a quote right quick listen oh my let me find right quick this just it's just bubbling it's bubbling church you got it bubbling pulling amen hallelujah that's what it's supposed to be we're supposed to come here holly and the preacher's not supposed to be able to preach his own thoughts listen this this is in the message uh uh at thy word lord this is what the prophet of god says you know if if if the enemy is trying to tell you today you know hold on to your secret i'ma tell you today don't listen to that devil if you want to enter in something new something something that you've never experienced before get that weight out of your life cause you think about it before i read this the power of confession for those of us who are parents or those of you who are parents or got children you know hallelujah you could eat when your child does something wrong you can easily bring judgment but how much grace do you give to them when they just tell the truth all you want is a positive confession a honest confession and you'll give even more grace when they give you an honest confession but if they tell you a lie and my mama hallelujah her name starts with a c and she used to come in here like sorrow she caught you in a lie you were done it's over ain't no mercy harley she gonna come off you until she hear wailings and gnashings of teeth hallelujah sandora used to come up in there you told a lie boy it's like she had a technique with that thing and used to always hit the spots that hurt let me tell you young people something the best thing you can do is listen to your christian parents because if god ever stop whipping you you're going to wish you wouldn't listen hallelujah young girl keep yourself listen to your parents stay virtuous because one thing you don't want is a baby by a guy that don't want you [Music] some whirly boy walking you to the bus station ain't even got a car and it's 20 below zero outside yeah get quiet get quiet you look at them early boys that's what you're gonna get can't do

being myself is the bloodhound [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] church one thing about god god loves us so much that he'll bring a word that won't allow us to continue in error it ain't the preacher stepping on your toes it's the grace of god god comes and tells you hey don't go that way go this way hallelujah don't go that way go this way that's the grace of god god giving us mercy oh my i got to come to the close but church listen what's your confession today oh yeah don't walk out of here saying brothers i still got this in my life i still got that in my life the whole reason why a message like this comes so that you can be burden-free [Music] give it to the lord let the lord deal with it hallelujah and then when those things arise again you say lord i gave it to you i'm not supposed to be feeling like this lord i gave it to you hallelujah [Music] holy is there not a burden that the lord cannot bear hallelujah amen remember holy why don't we confess jesus because all power in heaven and in earth is given unto him holy amen oh my church we bind the spirit of depression holy look we're not supposed to be depressed serving the lord it's the greatest thing you can do and people left the message because they felt uh stressed out or they felt uh depressed you know why because they had hidden secrets in their life that they still wanted to live yes that's why they felt that way they had un their unconverted desires in their life and they felt that the word of god kept them in bondage no honey those unconfessed sins kept them in bondage those those cravings and those desires kept them in bondage hallelujah because they really wanted to be delivered all they had to do was take it to the lord in prayer holly joshua chapter one listen the bible says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord speaketh to joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead hallelujah and you know we always type this with our prophet hallelujah it's dead now therefore arise and go over this jordan jordan always means death hallelujah die out to yourself amen he says and all these people we're going to bring the people with us everybody going to die today spiritually to out to your own desires he says and unto the land which i do give them even to the children of israel now look god has already said to the children of israel i didn't gave you a land it's yours so before i go any further that should have been their confession whenever they came into battle god didn't already gave us the land whenever something arrives god didn't already gave us about he didn't already gave us the land church when they went there and they saw those giants they should have said that confession should have been god has already given us the land [Music] hallelujah next verse evid oh we i want y'all to read it before i read it got to molly what are you confessing [Music] her church joshua hallelujah is a type of the holy ghost [Music] look what he says amen he says every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses what he said everything i gave unto brother brother [Music] i've given it unto you wherever the souls of your feet self try hallelujah footprints represent possession church tomorrow when you go to work you go in there like you own hallelujah when you walk in there hallelujah you walking there like you looking for a race [Music] this is what i want you to do hallelujah when you walk in at a mall walk by your supervisor's desk and look at that chair like it's yours [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah amen let the spirits know hallelujah that this business is thriving because i'm here i'm a son of god so you might be in the desk but it don't belong to you [Music] holly church he said whatever the souls of your feet shall trod i've given it unto you as i said unto moses next verse this he says from the wilderness and this great lebanon even unto the great river the great river euphrates all the land of the hittites every devil every at the land of the hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your coast whoa see god is saying there are no boundaries to when you believe [Music] oh my next verse he says that oh lord have mercy lord have mercy [Applause] i don't know if y'all ever been in a pentecostal church but you know sometimes the preacher gets preaching and they go over to people's heads and you know he say he say y'all don't hear me [Music] said well yahoo don't hear me i said there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee y'all don't hear me [Applause] does anybody hear me this morning the word shall be nazi even in thy mouth what are you confessing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what are you confessing to church [Applause] this is what god told joshua's church after the prophet went off the scene amen hallelujah oh my god and remember the prophet of god preached the message ephesians parallels joshua and we know ephesians was the church of adoption oh my god oh my look church let's read this again he said there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as long as you're in the land of the living nothing'll be able to stand before you [Music] not a bill do yeah hallelujah not a sickness [Music] not some unbelieving critic nothing will be able to stand before you all the days of thy life as i was with moses so look how was he with moses holly he came and he told our prophet he says because you've chose the harder way that a large portion of heaven awaits thee and if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet what do we receive and prophets be wrong oh you know that one oh you know that one so what are we confessing amen he said as i was with moses so so will i be with thee i will not fail thee oh according to god's word he says i will not fail thee [Music] that means that means when you walk in the bank if the people deny your loan it might be it might be denied which means delayed but that don't mean it ain't coming [Music] because god says i will not fail thee holly he might have another way to come where you don't have no interest hallelujah well you don't even have to pay it back hallelujah you wake up one day and somebody give you a lottery ticket [Music] hallelujah he says no forsake thee listen to the promise god has given us look at now this is god's confession this is what god telling the endtime believer whatever he said wherever the soul of your feet should go it's yours to the possession you know then he comes back he says uh uh nothing to be able to stand before you all the days of your life he said i will not fail thee nor for safety all right now i want to show you how much joshua believed in that promise we all right what time it is okay okay all right listen there was a time when joshua went into battle you can take it down bro joshua went into battle and he began to fight a place called a a a group of people called ai and god told him nothing to be able to stand before you wherever you go you're not going to lose a battle so joshua got there and lost the battle you know what joshua's saying joshua says something ain't right joseph say something ain't right because you know why you know why he said that because joshua wasn't used to losing hallelujah see church we got promises but we don't go back to the world because some of us got used to losing [Music] we we got used to backing ourselves down off the scripture when god didn't put that promise there hallelujah amen church don't back down up off of it if god made the promise you stand on it oh yeah so joshua he called the whole church together he said y'all look here i ain't supposed to lose so i don't know what y'all think about i ain't supposed to do so something wrong something wrong joshua called solemn assembly brought all the families together everybody and they found out aiken had did something he was supposed to do and joshua dealt with that confession he dealt with that confession holly not only did he kill him he killed his family put on his belongings everything that was connected to him he distorted and got it away from the church amen and then that's what i love went back and fought the same people he went back and fought the same people and defeated them hallelujah why because god's promise is true and look before i close josh was in another battle there's a lot of other things i could say but i'ma just calm it down church josh was in another battle he's fighting and he's looking at the sun and then inspiration starts to come the sun's going down he's fighting but then he starts to remember what god confessed over him nothing would be able to stand before you all of this whatsoever your feet tried i've given to you for possession so joshua was rehearsing everything god said to him in the middle of the battle what is he doing he's confessing that same promise over his situation in that moment god you said i can't lose the battle god you said you've given me this land for possession and in the middle of that battle more inspiration came hallelujah and then joshua rehearsing the promise of god to the inspiration came to now the spoken word is in his mouth and then joshua said son stand still then he went on and kept fighting and you know what happened the sun didn't move and the moon didn't move until joshua got the victory [Music] but he was so sold out confessing back to god what god said to him and he believed that thing till it was no longer just something come out of his mouth but he believed in his heart until it became actions in his life all the way to the place to now joshua's on the back side and he's down there praying and somebody's standing before him glowing hallelujah looking like an angel holly joshua didn't bow down to worship him joshua stood up and pulled his sword out why did he do that because he remember what god says nothing to be able to stand before you joshua was looking at the category of the host and joshua looked at him and said identify yourself [Music] church some things might look like god but you got to make it identify itself hallelujah make sure he's running in continuity with the promise holy joshua looking at the captain of the lord's host and he's remembered what god sent him nothing to be able to stand before you i won't leave you nor forsake you i won't fail you just be strong and very courageous joshua stands up and he says are you false all against us [Music] he's talking to an angel that's a man who believed what god said the angel says i'm the captain of the lord's house god brought reinforcements hollywood and joshua fell down and started to worship but if the angel wouldn't identify himself he would have to fight joshua that day why because joshua was sticking with the promise hallelujah church stick with the promise don't let satan take you off what god has said for you have the right confession come on musicians have the right confession why don't we confess the lord jesus because with him comes deliverance with him comes salvation with him comes healing with him comes joy and peace hell yeah all of the attributes of christ comes to us when we confess him as our personal savior church before i close real soft real soft listen there's a place in the scripture where we know where david took bathsheba and then nathan came and he he began to tell david in a parable david there was a rich man and a poor man and what the poor man had the rich man tucked and david said where is he imma kill him and nathan said david you that man [Music] but look at david's confession david said lord i have sinned and nathan said in that moment he said david don't worry about it your sins have been forgiven and the mercy of god came to david because he had the right confession holy see church once you confess then comes mercy don't let don't let the devil fool you dead yo don't do that you weak no i want to be weak in god's presence hallelujah i want the lord to have this way i don't want to hold nothing in my life that don't belong to god i want nothing that's going to hinder my journey i want nothing that's going to stop god from being close to me make your confessions this morning if you got something in your life that's stopping you from having a closer walk do that thing to god say lord i want to know you in the power of your resurrection but i don't want to just be coming to church
