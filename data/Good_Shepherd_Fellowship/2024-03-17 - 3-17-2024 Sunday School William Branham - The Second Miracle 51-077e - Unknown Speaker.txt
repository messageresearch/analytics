========================================

[Music] for the letter that our brother has read and for the attitude of our ministering Brethren here with us and for the audience around and your applauding makes us feel double welcome to come back again and if the good Lord is willing and as soon as we get the opportunity we'll return to this city to stay longer until the thing is over until God tells us it's enough time to go home that thank you kindly I trust that the meeting has been as much blessing to you as it has to to us I say this where I don't have to say it but I say it because it's the truth I've had larger crowds of course in bigger places and we'd had larger crowds here if we'd had the place to take care of them but I never met or was in a nicer meeting and meet met nicer people anywhere in the world than I have in this place that's right and with thank in my heart and I trust that that the meeting will never die that'll live right on in each Church among the people until Jesus comes that's our purpose of being here to bring these meetings everybody's been so kind and you've been so nice to sit in this hot building and it very hot like this and and just stand along the sides and drooping around the doors and come in early and all that's so nice of you and we appreciate it we appreciate this brother I can't think of you being half the time here brother banner and all the cooperating ministers we just thank God for you Brethren you've been so good to us we just trust that God will just pour out his blessings everywhere up on all and to all you people there is just telling me they taking up a love offering for me a few moments ago I appreciate that I don't deserve it that's true I I don't deserve it but brother bter said all the debts were paid and everything and then when they do that then they get a love offering and we appreciate it and and to the best of my knowledge and all that I know every penny of it I shall spend for the glory of God the best that I know how there won't be one foolish thing that that money will go for because at that day we want to be found a good true faithful Steward of his welfare and some of you paid maybe a portion of your living I I wish you wouldn't do that there someone when they taking up a love offering throw a nickel or something and I could you know just something I have got some children and you know how it is but I wish I didn't have to do that but to take one but I do once in a while because I just you can't make ends but we thank you for it God bless you everyone now I trust that I remember in a meeting I used to tell of a little story been at my old brother sitting here I want to shake his hand before St into the ministry our ministering to of the word one time I was going to take up an offering in my church I told my wife I said we just got to have I never took an offering for myself my life and I said we got to have it just a little money I said I tell I'll take up we owed a debt and just had to pay it and so that was my uh former wife it was I was she died years and years ago about 14 years ago and I was single for about five or six years a little boy started in school I remarried again God gave me back a perfect image of the little girl that he just taken from me and so I'm so happy about that and then I remember one night it's been about eight years ago I guess we got to a place where we just couldn't make the things going I said I'm going to over and take up an offering she said I'm going to sit down and watch it and so I went over and I told old brother wi heart go get my hat I was going to take up an offering and he looked at me real strange and he started and I looked down and I don't over the r where you ever know Sister Weber remember her and I Frankie's mother and she went out under that little old checked a and got out one little pocket books you know little snaps over the top begin to pull out them nickels oh I couldn't do that I said I was just teasing I didn't mean it and so brother wiart looked at me real strange and went and hung my head up and you know what brother Ryan had rolled a bicycle down in my house and give it to me many of you's been the meeting he me refer to that brother Ryan rolled a bicycle down there and he just left there and give it to me I pained the bicycle and sold it and got the money P to De all these [Applause] [Applause] my poor brother he gave me the bicycle really I couldn't ride the bicycle I did all the D he a good de well bless the Lord that's very nice so I thank you kindly and it is indeed With all sincerity my trust that I can come back to toita just as soon as possible now when I leave Africa come home the Lord willing I'm going out to seek his face to find out which move next I believe you all appreciate that more if you know just exactly where to go he sends me to toita we're going to stay to toita until he says you go somewhere else and just stay there till it's over right now the meeting's just in condition now to where we could really have a real Revival just right now you see all the the spooky feelings of people saying well it might be this it might be that but that's all gone now it's just a great big welcome feeling everywhere you see that's just way to have a Revival to really start it now what do you think about four to six weeks that this would do oh my we'd have a glorious time I tell you I I believe everything in the around would be healed if we can just one by one now the Lord has blessed us this week the lame has walked cripples has been healed and the death is heard and diseas is you know healed and the Lord and I want you to remember this especially to the pastors there'll be weeks after this that you'll hear people in your churches say well I that that Su trouble I had left me I don't know and that women and so forth of the different troubles that you have there's there's been at least I would say this not trying to to say anything wrong because I I don't want to do that God hold me responsible but there's been at least 500 people I'd say lowly estimating that's set in the audience that's never said a word about it that's healed right now now that's right the other night when the last two nights I have never felt such a pull on me and all my life now the way that feels come here just a minute brother when people are being healed now I just want to take this moment to explain this if if when I'm talking to a person I turn and get their attention like out in the audience I look at somebody and see maybe it looks kind of well I go to talking to that person and want to go to talk and then I'll get in contact with their spirit and then it seems like there's something starts pulling just like this and then when it lets up I get real weak that person's healed that's all thank you brother and that's that person is is healed they may not recognize it right then but they will later on they'll recognize they'll recognize as it's been done now may the good Lord bless every one of you and just fill you with his goodness and mercy and all you sitting along here and here I see these three or four chairs sitting here and people with different ailments suffering and everything uh you just be of a good courage and believe with all all your heart and God's going to make everyone well I don't know where there's any laying back under there so far that it's just right down here sometimes I'm miss seeing these people are looking over the top of them watching out there um well I don't know what else to say but to tell you I'm I'm so happy to be with you and I trust that maybe if you get a chance sometime when your own church hasn't got service next week to slip up the area with us we'd be happy to have you and write metime write me down home I'll be glad to hear from you and sometimes it's sending out these anointed cloths and so forth how many believes in sending those out those oh that's wonderful well I tell you if you just go into my office and see the thousands of healings takes place just by sending those claws just thousands here recently I was sent one to Germany to a woman that had arthritis for years and it was translated on the back of her German right in she got a hold of that cloth and she pinned it on her and followed the instructions and she said now devil you get out she got up and walked across floor she was now devil you get out now she just believed it and a little something uh I hope if I told this testimony just a moment before the audience you forgive me for it cuz I'm sometimes telling around different places I don't know if people that's been the meetings an outstanding one was one night when I was in a little a church meeting at caring Arkansas just starting and I used to take and send give the people H just and in the meetings like here here's a box of them I don't get a chance to minister to those just like this because I'm always when the meeting is going on in deem prayer then when I go home brother bter was with me the other day I've got a cave way back in the Hills where I go to I showed him where I met the angel on the path I was going back there all torn up and I'm let him on the path and he told me said you return back to your car for I've called you to be with ER Baxter and I went to him and we've been together so right on that place I go back there and pray hours after hours over every piece of goods that I send to the people now I don't stand anxious because they cost about 10 cents a piece and we send out around anywhere 5 6 7,000 a week I don't have the money to do that but I buy hundreds and hundreds of yards of ribbon and cut it off in little strips like this the people can pin it on their clothes I'd be glad to send you one if you don't need it right now put it in the Bible on Acts 19 and just keep it there and if an emergency Rises take it and lay it on your child has got the coup or whatever takes place and believe God just as a little U token of his love in this meeting and many things has been done and it's free of charge just saying we'd be happy to send it to you now I this lady I gave her a hand she wanted me to she said bless the handkerchief now a lot of people anoint them that's all right anything that God blesses I'm for it but if you watch the scripture Paul didn't anoint them he take them off of his body see just off of his body I believe that's right is it and Paul knew that you know where I think he got that Brethren I think when Elijah taking the told said take my staff and go lay it on the child you see Elijah knew that everything that he touched was blessed but whether the woman would believe it or not and Paul taken from his body an and aprons and laid on the sick and unclean spirits went out of them and diseases were healed now it wasn't Paul it was God that is God and honoring the people's faith in his servant well now the same God was there I'm not the St Paul none of us are but he's still the same Jesus you see it wasn't it wasn't the St Paul anyhow but it was Jesus now this woman taking it and put it in her Bible and a few weeks after that she was cleaning a lamp chimney way back there in a cotton country of Arkansas and the old an chimy broken and cut the archery in her arm now this is her story she got a pillow slip and put over it and it just got wet with blood she got a sheep close to his neighbor was two miles her husband was in the city and she's bleeding getting weaker she knew she was going to die shortly if something didn't happen and she thought of the hand Chief she went and got the hand Chief and laid it on there now here's her testimony when her husband came in that evening she waited about two mile or better through the mud with their boots on hung a lantern in the tree caught the Greyhound bus and come to a little rock where was holding the meeting and walked in with these boots on holding this handkerchief praising God the handkerchief wasn't even stained just a miracle just stopped it right like that the woman was dying that's the only thing that she could get to like that as she knew of and God honored her faith in doing so now we all we us believe that I've sent a little thing with it it tells you how you get to your pastor and get him to come and and confess your faults and get rid of everything and then lay it on there there's nothing in the way God will do it don't you believe that and now God be with you and thank you again from the pastors to the co-workers The Strangers in our gates the custodian sh the auditorium all the ushers you've all been wonderful and may God's richest of blessings be upon you all pray for me while I'm going Yonder to pray for someone else I want to read just a little bit of scripture before we start the meeting cuz we want to give plenty time in the prayer line tonight just as long as we can then immediately after this I got to catch a Greyhound bus and bump my till morning I couldn't get a reservation I've got to go home the wife was going to try to get here and she couldn't get here no one to bring her so I have to go in tonight to get her to come back tomorrow and and be in area so pray for me now while I read this scripture found in St John 4:46 beginning so Jesus came again into Canan of Galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain noan whose son was sick at capernium and when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death then said Jesus unto him now listen close except you see signs and wonders you will not believe but listen this Gallant man answer our master and an old woman said unto him sir come down ear my child I Jesus said unto him go thy way thy son liveth now the man wanted Jesus to come pray for his son but Jesus told him he didn't go pray for him he said go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that Jesus spoke unto him and he went his way and when he was now going down his servant met him and told him saying thy son liveth then inquired he required him saying beg your pardon then inquired he of them the hour he began to am in then said he un to him yesterday at the seventh hour the the fever left him see he was just mending getting a little better so the father knew that it was the same hour that Jesus said thy son liveth and himself beli and his whole household this is again the second miracle that Jesus did when he came out of Judea and Galilee let's bow our heads Lord now the service is almost ready to begin again a closing night here among this lovely people people God how did you ever bless me in such a way to bring me up and let me be able to stand and talk to such an audience of people lovely Born Again Christians oh God I just love you for it and there's no words that I can find to express my thanks that you let me meet these ministers and these people out here lovely people your people the very cream of the crop of the Earth's Harvest and not only that to meet them and to know them but to have fellowship with them through thy son Christ Jesus and to know that I'm a fellow citizen with them an heir of the same kingdom of God we're journeying through earth going to heaven where we'll associate together through out ceaseless ages throughs of time we'll be together forever not where we'll be sick again are not where we'll be in buildings and have to crawl across the the country to pray for each other but where there'll be no sickness and there'll be no old age or there will be no cripples or no blind but we'll be young there forever and we'll be in his likeness and what a glorious time that'll be oh Father I just feel like just raising my hands up and just screaming as loud as I can to give vent to the feeling that's within me of the appreciations of all that you've done bless this city Lord bless the people bless the the lawmakers of the city God grant that there will be an oldfashioned Revival to sweep this city Lord and these anointed ones that's sitting here in the presence tonight these Ministers of God represented here on this platform and out there in that audience oh God charge their life with New Vision with new power and may there just be abundance of rain from everywhere Lord coming into the churches hear the prayer of your servant now and now keep us ever in your will give us a great service tonight for we ask it in the name of thy Child Jesus amen I believe Billy has stepped out brother back for just a moment it's till they come in now have faith don't doubt believe with all your heart and let's look tonight for for the climax of all the meeting will you do that I believe if God will visit us this third time like he has the last two nights I believe it'll settle the question don't you all the letters are pouring in so just from places about how they're being healed and people going home and leaving the meeting going home and then be there maybe a few hours the first thing you know wake up the next morning maybe blind seeing and the or just everything's taking place how thankful the thing that people hear you don't you don't get to hear a third of it it's after a day or two do you notice Jesus here when he said thy son liveth well that was one day and the next day he was going down and his son had began to amend he said this is the second miracle that Jesus did seemingly we wouldn't call that a miracle but it was a miracle because anything that's out of the ordinary it's a miracle Jesus told the man that his son was going to live and the man believed what Jesus said is that right perhaps there's 100 prayer cards in here tonight in a few moments I'll call from somewhere in those prayer cards well then you say brother Brandon then if my prayer card is not called what about it that don't mean that you're you can't get healed you can be healed anywhere that you'll believe that Jesus Christ healed you see anywhere will you always remember that always remember that healing everything that Christ can do for you is already done amen see everything that Christ and God can do for you is already done now the next thing lays within you if you're a sinner Jesus has already saved you but you when he died to take away the sin of the world but you have to accept it if you'd say I've paid your way brother brandom home well it wouldn't do me no good unless I accepted it and Christ death won't help you until you accept it now by his stripes you were healed he heals you when he made the atonement for you but now it'll never do you no good till you accept it and when you accept it and believe it then it is yours now you see it's up to you now the things that he does he sends signs and wonders to to prove those things that it's that it can be done here I'd like for you to [Music]
