let's sing that one more time [Music] is [Music] oh praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah amen thank you musicians uh we would just uh take our bibles and and uh read uh a verse of two years the book of ephesians praise the lord ephesians chapter one see fish in chapter one ephesians chapter one let's just read the reading from verse one uh just for some scripture reading paul an apostle of jesus christ by the way of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in christ a calling as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoptions of children by jesus christ to himself i call into the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the beloved let's pray together father we have read your sacred word and dear god we can close the book tonight because it's written that blessed is he that read the word and blessed is he also that year of the word father the blessing is already giving lord what we need tonight lord is for you o god through the channel of inspiration father to all god still of that blessing so father that has already been given oh god to our house tonight something no lord father that will be said that will draw us closer to you oh father we love you we appreciate you will god bless us together now father and those that are tuning in bless them also we just thank you father in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord i think there's a sister back there that we would love to greet god bless you good to see you amen now uh uh we've been talking uh this guy on sunday on that uh uh crossing jordan and positionally placing and uh [Music] so we would like to just stay on that taught read something from uh from the word like we did and also from uh uh from the prophet uh message and uh on ephesian parallel joshua and then we will ask uh trust that the law will be just be able to take a thought from there i will i won't love to keep you very long so you'll be able to drive and get uh home before uh the fullness of the snow of the night comes so now but uh uh like brother branham said and we all know we read that a little bit how how the book of ephesians parallel the book of joshua and and we were talking about this uh uh position on employing now where i was trying to go with this thought and and wanted to encourage encourage you is to realize that uh [Music] even the old god uh uh promised the children of israel you know give them that land and uh through the promise he gave to their father abraham but we realized that they had to fight for every inch of ground praise the lord and that's what i want to to to encourage us uh you know that's what i want to encourage us that that god will be able to give us grace that we will be able to to fight for every inch of ground praise the lord uh uh sunday morning we we spoke a little bit and talking about how god uh uh from from the from the birthstone of the mothers of israel have their naming and you know their inheritance their position was already declared jacob comes and then he he prophesied about his sons placing them into the promise you see so the thing the thing that thought about it there is the the father he will represent god our father the mother will represent our our birth in the church when we come to the knowledge of truth yeah there are there are some things i was just reading something in the in the office i wanted to go in that direction i says no you know these are some of the things where you get in and then you start preaching the whole series but uh [Music] what i was actually looking at and that caught my attention is that thing about the prodigal son tonight just before we get into what i want to share with you when you think about the story of the prodigal son you realize that he grew in his uh in his father's house and and he had uh you know made to take care of him and you know the father gave him the best but you realize that he really never knew himself all the time he was in the father house he really never taught or ever imagined himself eating in the pig pan he never imagined himself going without a meal he might have experienced the love of his father in a different way but he had never experienced the mercy of his father because remember you got to remember that he thought in his mind i'm going back to my father as a seven now realizing that he can never lost his son's shape you see he he never did lost his sonship but there are things that uh uh uh he lost his position from being the pr a prince here you see he was feeling peaks okay that's what brother branham would call living honor our privilege as children of god now we realize that i mean uh [Music] 2022 is here we don't know what the year holds but we know him the whole time in eternity that's where our joy is praise the lord but uh uh i mean there there are different things that law might allow to happen or different things the law might allow us to go through and but we we believe that every trial that he reports in our way the scripture says he will be there to see us true but what what we want to prepare our ourself for uh you know when and trusting that the grace of god will be able to help us to realize that we have a position just like paul says here paul brother branham says ephesians paralyzed joshua now uh joshua placed the people into their natural promise now paul is placing the church into her spiritual promise but see the way that he's doing it he's taking the church i wonder i will take you through the book of efficient if i can be able to do it quickly before my teddy meetings is out and you will see him he's taking the church right from the mind of god amen he's taking the church from heavenly places he's talking about uh uh what was in the mind of god even before we were ever born and uh uh he had blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in christ jesus i call him as he has choosing us before the foundation of the word praise the lord you see there's there's uh he has choosing us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy with our blame before him in love now that's what brother branham would call the picture that god took of us in his mind so paul is bringing us all the way from there and he's going to bring us now into our our our natural birth and then he's going to bring us into the church we'll we will see that a little bit here now so brother branham said this let's just read this uh from the ephesian parallel joshua he says that this book of ephesians perfectly parallel the old testament joshua ephesian the book of efficient the book of efficient draw is together positionally placed the church now i have typed it with joshua if you notice israel was brought up out of egypt and there's three stages in the adjoining the first stage was leaving egypt the next stage was in the wilderness and then the next stage was over in canaan he says now canada does not represent the age of the millennium it only represents the age of the overcomers now so that's where the focus is if we represent the age of the overcomers then there are things that we need to overcome there are things that we will overcome praise the lord not only that we need to overcome but there are things that we will overcome praise the lord because the power is not in yourself the power is in the word praise the lord so can a year represent the age of the overcomer the dispensation of overcoming the dispensation of overcoming because in canada they killed and burned and took cities and there will be no death in the millennium but another thing that it does it brings up justification by faith after they believed in moses and left egypt sanctification following under the pillow of fire and the atonement of the sacrificial line in the wilderness and then entering into the land that has been promised now what is the lane told the new testament believer the land the promise is the holy ghost the holy spirit praise the lord and he says also this he says did you know this joshua before the cross jordan joshua said go through the mess of the camp and claim your cloth and sanctify every one of you let no man come at his wife within three days you will see the glory of god so it's that place of sincerity that we started talking on on the wash night before we came over to sunday you know uh uh uh because that that was the portion that inverted brandon's vision about uh if you can be sincere you know that's the only way he could escape the second bite you know that's the only way he could rebuke the serpent and they get away from the people if he will be sincere so uh you know so that that is just out of there that we're trying to prepare ourselves to you know trying to put our mind on and so he says you will see the glory of god it is process of getting ready to inherit the promise praise the lord amen to inherit the promise and i tell you young people don't tell the god of heaven make this word real to you amen we can have good music we can have you know good church and good people around us but until god make this world make this message real to you that's the thing that will hold you in the hour of temptation it has to be a person you have to see jesus christ coming from out of the world it's not just the message i mean the message no it has to be the person of jesus christ praise the lord especially with all the things that are happening around and and in in in all the the you know the the confusion and and you know and disappointment and everything that is hopping around i mean it has to be jesus christ making himself real to each and every one of us because he's a living god amen he's a living god living among his people so here we see we see paul let me go back and forth a little bit now we read here in ephesians 1 verse 3 again blessed be the god and father of our our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places praise the lord amen now let's go to ephesians chapter six let's go to ephesians chapter six i think i've shared that with you before now in ephesians chapter six or having that should be verse 10. having my two actually in verse 12. ephesians chapter 6 verse 12 for we rise or not against flesh and blood but against principality against power against the ruler of darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places now so the same word that is used for heavenly places is the same word that is used for high places praise the lord amen let me show you something also isaiah chapter 12. isaiah chapter 12 or chapter 14 isaiah chapter 14. now this is just an hesitation tonight we know isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 is familiar how are thou falling from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how are they cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation for thou have said in the heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north praise the lord now watch that position now lucifer the son of the morning the one that turned to be the devil the second and uh he's desiring expressing that desire to sit in the side of the north let's go to the book of sam psalm chapter 48 psalm chapter 48. let's read from verse one great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness beautiful situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the side of the north did something catch your attention praise the lord amen is that not the same side of the nerf that lucifer says i was sent to heaven and i will sit in the side of the nerf and yet david is identifying that the side of the nerf is the city of the great king praise the lord so you see it's the same thing here also inefficient paul is saying all your spiritual blessing is in heavenly places but yet it's the same place where spiritual weakness principalities you see that's the reason why brother branham says we we we're not we're not in the picnic people we are in the battlefield we are in the battlefield i mean we we don't have to experience some of the worst things that other people have experienced drugs and and and different things in their lives before we realize that that there is a devil i think so far now you must know that there is a devil praise the lord now young people this is this is really for you yeah are you are you seeing the picture are you seeing the comparison or should we read that scripture again did something cut your attention you see that's that's how when you read the bible it's it's not a newspaper you know you you read the scripture you are looking you you are listening and you and you see things like that come on you say wait now i read this thing somewhere the side of the north you think about it just like israel in their natural promise god give uh you know uh uh told abraham bless him i will bless you you know i i will bless your seeds uh uh uh like the stars of heaven like the sand by the sea show you know i will bless you and we ever you know curses you will be cursed we ever bless you will be blessed but you see even the land i was giving for them they had to fight for every inch of ground even though it was their lane it was given to them god promised it to abraham your seed shall sow john into strange land i will bring he said i will bring them back but yet they have to fight for every inch of ground you have the spiritual blessing like paul says right here inefficient when god took a picture of you it was for you to be holy without blame praise the lord amen now you are a my my trigger in the back of your mind but then why am i born and singing why am i born in sin why did i come to the word speaking lies the reason is is because god is going to take you through a journey to bring you back to what he had of you in his mind he's going to take you through a journey because the picture that he took of you was had nothing to do with your first birth so now your first birth is going to be the beginning of that journey for you to go back to that picture he had of you in his mind that's the reason why you know uh uh he will require you to be born again that's the reason why he will require you to confess your sin receive the holy ghost you know get closer to god and let god change your life and all of that because he took a picture of you and he can lost you praise the lord he's going to do everything to bring you back to the way he thought of you in the beginning you see when we are safe it's almost like we came from a deep slate and we don't even know where we are we are still waking up to the reality of things around us we think we know what is going on you have no idea you are still waking up to the reality of things around you in the city the sound of the not the city of the great king that's where she don't say i will i will make my seat in the side of the north he had bless you with all spiritual blessing heavenly places yet principalities power spiritual weakness in high places is your battle so you see brother branham says that's that's what the uh can mean for the believer the dispensation of overcoming they are things that we will have to we have to deal with they are things that we will have to overcome and god will give us grace to overcome praise the lord it's not by power is not by might it's by the grace of the almighty god praise the lord like i've always said whenever god is dealing with you on something is is is an opportunity god is making you a partner to be able to identify something in your life he wants you to be a partner in the process of getting he have already paid the price amen he have already paid the price for our past sin our present sin our future sin he have already cashed it it's already paid but how to bring us to that place of possessing this this uh this body of living a victorious uh christian life or living a life like an adopted son or an adopted daughter praise the lord was it sounds so strange to me i was listening to well the radio preacher and he was talking about adoption he was comparing it with uh the natural adoption that we know you know go and take somebody's child no it's it's different is the father that is investing in the in the child in the son or in the daughter to be able to trust him with an inheritance see that's the reason why when you when you look at the the the the story of the prodigal son jesus go right back in the book of luke you will see jesus he had he had two crowds in his congregation he had the pharisees on one side and he also had the publicans on one side and he decided to throw this story about the the the practical son praise the lord for god to bring you in loudly short age he never brought man that david he never brought men and solomon solomon will have heart problems he was in the age of decency he had housing wife if he was in this age what is tripping himself naked he would just he would just get crazy and die god couldn't trust him with this age but god trusted you amen oh fine brother solomon like a crazy man on the street it says sound funny but it's true and that's one thing that we can be proud of as as sons and daughters of god you know sometimes the devil just beats our head and try to make you to feel like you don't walk you know nothing good can come out of you he's doing that because he's afraid of you praise the lord he's afraid of you he know what it is when the son of god comes to recognize himself when a daughter of god comes to recognize themselves the devil know what it is to be able to trust this word of god yes he know what it is can you imagine uh jonah being caught in the in in a in the the the the belly of a well and he right in that place being swallowed by the fish and yet he's finding a way to knee down and pray and i mean and you know jonah is not he's not lord i rebuke this fish lord get me out of this fish bella lord that that's not what he's doing all he did was to be able to find a promise the lord you told solomon that whenever your people get in trouble and they get on their knees to pray and they turn their face to the holy temple you say you hear from heaven now all he did he just found a promise to realize that all the prophecy paul spoke about perilous time where man will be high-minded disobedient to parents very unthankful that that's the spirit that we're dealing with that's the spirit that we're dealing with and i'm telling telling you that uh i mean jesus sorry is going to get worse you're all about the fussing on the on the airline you hear the road rages every day somebody's people are fighting with gun brother branham say if it continues like that if every every human will pack a gun and what it is is that he says the holy ghost is living is living it's only going to be in the hearts of the believer but yet god trusted you to live in such a time like this this is the beauty of serving god it's the beauty of believing the message of the hour it's the beauty of knowing what we know to look at the time that we are living in and with everything that is happening and yet we can be in church on wednesday night there is no church bus that go around and pick everybody up and give everybody free riding you know and then when we go there and then we distribute groceries at the doorway and everybody take groceries you know and we know that our thursday is count out because we're having food to eat when you get on your knees to pray and you can be able to sing son and lift your hands to god and pick up god's word or all player tip of the prophet you must be proud in your heart to be a child of god don't be proud about your look all about your clothes have a proud in your heart to know that i'm a child of god praise the lord god is faithful he's the one that have promised and he's more than able to be able to bring us through praise lord he more than able to be able to bring us through we will have battles we will have challenges we will have problems for the matter of fact brandon 1956 just imagine 1956 when brother branham was about to preach the message the junction of time he said it's not going to be any better he said the only hope that i see for this word is the coming of the lord it's going to be darker darker and harder praise the lord but you see that message you read the uh the prophecy when the enemy come as a flaw the spirit of god will raise up a standard but branham says they will get
