[35:27] my heart
[35:29] uh
[35:31] at home
[35:32] uh in our our
[35:36] our
[35:38] home bible reading
[35:39] we're reading from the book of
[35:42] testimony and and uh
[35:46] there's a verse there there that just
[35:48] pick up something to my heart
[35:50] and uh and that's what i wanted to speak
[35:53] on tonight
[35:54] but uh
[35:56] uh
[35:57] i was i was just meditating on it
[35:58] listening to a message on my way home
[36:01] uh
[36:02] from the office and then uh
[36:05] something dropped from my heart
[36:07] and i said well okay i will i will just
[36:10] follow the lord and see what he want us
[36:12] to do so let's read uh
[36:15] deuteronomy chapter 10 1 tonight let's
[36:17] read from verse 1.
[36:18] and moses went and and and speak these
[36:22] words
[36:23] unto all israel
[36:27] and he said unto them
[36:30] ah

[36:56] also the lord have said unto me thou
[37:01] shalt not go over this jordan
[37:04] praise the lord
[37:05] so moses is saying it is not only
[37:07] because i'm weak but because god has
[37:09] also said
[37:12] that you will not be able to go over
[37:13] jordan
[37:14] the lord thy god will go
[37:19] over before thee
[37:21] and he will destroy these nations from
[37:25] before thee
[37:27] and thou shalt possess them
[37:31] and joshua he shall go over before thee
[37:35] as the lord have said
[37:38] praise the lord
[37:48] let's pray together and we'll continue
[37:50] to read father we want to thank you
[37:52] for the portion of your word that we

[38:05] lord something that will bring strength
[38:08] internal value
[38:09] and something that will bring us closer
[38:11] to the cross
[38:13] we love you tonight we appreciate you
[38:15] father in jesus name
[38:17] amen
[38:18] the lord bless you you may have your
[38:19] seed
[38:20] we will continue to read from there
[38:23] and uh
[38:26] we all know what is what is happening
[38:28] around the world
[38:30] and uh uh
[38:32] [Music]
[38:37] we just we just believe that uh
[38:40] god is in control amen
[38:42] god is in control and he will he will
[38:45] fight for his people
[38:46] praise the lord
[38:48] amen but uh
[38:50] humanly speaking when you when you just
[38:52] you you're listening to the news and you
[38:54] see everything that is happening you ask
[38:58] what a word that we are living in
[39:00] you know what a word that we are living
[39:02] in the word is filling
[39:04] you know the word
[39:06] the word uh uh
[39:08] uh not that is is feeling it has already
[39:12] failed
[39:13] you know it's it's falling apart like
[39:15] brother branham said
[39:16] and it's to the bottom of faith
[39:19] praise the lord
[39:20] you would think that uh
[39:23] what happened to the jews on a hitler
[39:26] uh if if something like this is
[39:28] happening
[39:29] uh the nations of the world
[39:32] will jump on it right away
[39:34] and say never again
[39:37] praise the lord
[39:39] but you see with the united nations they
[39:42] fly in plains they go and sit down they
[39:45] put a bottle of water before them they
[39:47] go in lazier's hotel eat the best food
[39:50] with with earphones in their ears they
[39:53] sit there you know uh
[39:56] uh playing uh video games on their phone
[40:00] and and it says they are making
[40:02] decisions for the world
[40:05] praise the lord
[40:09] the prophet of god says our lives are in
[40:11] the hands of cruel men
[40:14] praise the lord
[40:15] they are in the hands of cruel men
[40:18] i only told you from your political
[40:20] party
[40:21] but we have a kingdom
[40:24] that is coming
[40:26] amen
[40:27] and that's the one i want to i want to
[40:29] cast my life in as a vote for
[40:32] now for anyone yet on earth
[40:34] praise the lord
[40:36] and uh and all of that so i mean with
[40:39] everything that is that is that is just
[40:41] going on it's just hard for you to kind
[40:44] of push things back from your mind
[40:47] so tonight i would just uh i would just
[40:50] want to take sides with the word of god
[40:53] and uh
[40:54] and just be able to
[40:56] uh
[40:57] you know express my thoughts a little
[40:59] bit so i took i took uh
[41:01] a little thing from
[41:03] a familiar story that brother branham
[41:05] spoke about with uh
[41:07] the emblem on the stadium you know it's
[41:10] not the size
[41:11] of
[41:13] the dog
[41:14] you know but it's the size of the fight
[41:17] that is in the dog
[41:19] that's what i want to speak on tonight
[41:21] the size of the fight
[41:23] that is in the dark
[41:27] it's not the size of the dog in the
[41:28] fight
[41:30] but the size of the fight
[41:32] that is in the dark
[41:34] praise the lord
[41:36] amen
[41:40] and uh
[41:42] [Music]
[41:45] praise the lord
[41:48] and now so we continue to read here
[41:51] we read verse 3 there verse 4 and the
[41:53] lord shall do unto them as he did unto
[41:57] sheehan
[41:58] and to us king of the amorites and unto
[42:01] the land of of them whom he destroyed
[42:05] and the lord shall give them up before
[42:08] your face that yea may do unto them a
[42:12] calling unto all the commandments which
[42:16] i have commanded you
[42:20] be strong
[42:22] and offer good courage
[42:24] now if you if you go back in and then
[42:27] you
[42:27] you do
[42:28] uh bible search
[42:31] on courage
[42:33] you will realize that
[42:35] every time from the first time that
[42:37] courage was used in the bible
[42:40] every time it was used
[42:42] it took a little it took a little
[42:45] change over in the new testament but
[42:47] every time it was used in the old
[42:50] testament it was always
[42:53] having courage to stand
[42:56] for the land that god gave them
[42:59] or for the people
[43:04] praise the lord
[43:06] every time that god told them have a
[43:09] good courage or be courageous
[43:12] it was it was uh it was always for the
[43:16] land
[43:17] it was always in the sense that
[43:20] it was always for his promises
[43:26] yes amen praise the lord
[43:30] amen
[43:31] now because you you have to realize that
[43:35] uh uh uh uh if if god made a promise his
[43:39] promise cannot fail
[43:42] praise the lord
[43:44] but in one sense how he's going to bring
[43:47] his promise to pass the entirety of how
[43:51] he would do it he never told us
[43:55] praise the lord
[43:57] so to believe that god's word will come
[44:00] to pass you have to be courageous
[44:05] why because your faith will be put to
[44:08] the test
[44:11] praise the lord now you we have to
[44:13] realize is we we are not the one that is
[44:17] fulfilling god's word
[44:19] it's god that fulfill his word
[44:25] praise the lord
[44:28] is god that fulfilled his word so for
[44:31] for for you to uh for us to be in a
[44:34] place and wait for their fulfillment
[44:38] because you see one thing that the fall
[44:40] gave us the fall give us a nature of
[44:44] being anxious
[44:47] it's a falling nature to be anxious we
[44:50] want it now
[44:53] we want to see it happening now
[44:58] praise the lord
[45:01] but every time you look through the
[45:03] scripture that i i i kind of looked
[45:06] through it and uh you know just read a
[45:08] few a few of them and it just kind of
[45:11] caught my attention and says oh wow what
[45:13] beautiful you know uh uh
[45:16] the way that god you know you know uh
[45:20] a sense
[45:22] this bible
[45:24] that we have in our hands
[45:29] is divinely designed
[45:34] praise the lord
[45:36] this is
[45:38] not only the word of god but is the
[45:40] living
[45:42] word of god
[45:47] praise the lord
[45:49] i can i can i can be able to take you on
[45:51] a sequence of things through the
[45:53] scripture it will blow your mind
[45:56] you know it will it will it will blow
[45:58] your mind you you look at you look at
[46:00] take for example you look at the uh even
[46:03] uh uh in the new testament
[46:06] you look at the four books
[46:09] for uh uh uh
[46:11] record full full testimony of the
[46:14] ministry of jesus christ you will
[46:16] realize that each of
[46:19] those
[46:20] writers
[46:22] there is
[46:25] one
[46:27] specific word that they choose to use
[46:32] amen
[46:34] like like you look for uh local mark
[46:36] mark used he used this word most of the
[46:39] straight way you'll find the word
[46:41] straightway
[46:42] he used that a lot in the book of mack
[46:44] straightway
[46:46] and there is there is uh there is uh
[46:50] and and and in the way that they use it
[46:53] each one of the gospel
[46:55] they have a unique word
[46:58] that they use in a sequence of seven
[47:06] in a sequence of seven
[47:19] and then and that's and that's uh and
[47:21] that's the way
[47:22] god designed
[47:24] his word that's the way he designed it
[47:29] you'll realize that you have read a
[47:30] scripture
[47:32] and uh and and and before and all the
[47:34] time like like what i had on my mind to
[47:36] preach how much time do i have you okay
[47:40] what i had on my mind to speak on i was
[47:43] actually going to talk tonight on making
[47:46] your election your call and your
[47:48] election show amen
[47:51] you know i was that's that's what i was
[47:53] going to speak on tonight
[47:55] and uh because i realized that uh
[47:59] uh
[48:02] the language
[48:04] that the holy spirit speaks sometimes
[48:08] is misunderstood
[48:11] because we think the holy spirit is
[48:13] speaking english
[48:16] no but the holy spirit is speaking what
[48:19] the spirit is saying to the church
[48:22] the bible say he that have ears must
[48:24] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[48:26] church
[48:29] now because
[48:30] of how the apostle paul
[48:34] peter said that's peter that said that
[48:37] he says
[48:39] making your call in your election show
[48:43] it put our mind
[48:47] in a place when you say when you say
[48:49] make these things to happen it puts your
[48:51] mind in a place that you have to do
[48:53] something
[48:55] so many of the times we think
[48:58] that
[48:59] making our call and our election show is
[49:02] something that we have to do
[49:05] sure
[49:06] and then
[49:08] legalizing also tie it down to works
[49:15] you have to make sure you are doing this
[49:17] you have to make sure you are doing this
[49:20] but uh
[49:24] uh first testimony in chapter one
[49:29] first testilum chapter 1.
[49:40] praise the lord
[49:44] thessalonians 1.
[49:54] love the lord tonight
[49:59] hello he's so good
[50:02] he's so good he's so wonderful
[50:07] now first testosterone in chapter one
[50:09] let's let's look at that if i believe is
[50:11] verse 4
[50:13] if if if i do believe that is verse 4
[50:20] first esther ruling
[50:22] chapter 1
[50:24] verse 4 verse 4 says
[50:28] knowing brethren's beloved
[50:32] your election
[50:33] of god
[50:35] let's go back to verse 3 remembering
[50:38] without seizing your work paul's talking
[50:41] to the to the the brothers there now
[50:44] in tests uh testilonica
[50:47] remembering without seizing your works
[50:49] of faith and your labor of love and the
[50:51] passion
[50:53] of hope
[50:56] in our lord jesus christ in the sight of
[50:59] god
[51:01] and our father
[51:02] norim
[51:04] brethren's beloved
[51:06] your election
[51:09] of god
[51:11] amen
[51:13] so that's where my thought for some
[51:15] reason i just got caught on that
[51:18] ignoring your election
[51:21] ignoring your election
[51:24] now that's the same language
[51:26] that peter is using when he says make
[51:29] your election
[51:31] your calling and your election not make
[51:34] it
[51:35] as if to say you are doing it
[51:38] but no who call you
[51:42] who is he that called you
[51:46] when were you called
[51:50] when
[51:52] is it when you started coming to church
[51:54] or you believe the message
[52:00] ignoring your election
[52:03] it's not your election is not every four
[52:05] years
[52:09] no don't start now amen
[52:13] praise the lord
[52:14] don't stop now
[52:18] your election is not every four years
[52:22] ignoring your election
[52:32] ignoring your election of god
[52:43] praise the
[52:44] lord
[52:46] if the lord
[52:49] gave us the grace we will talk on that
[52:52] and i just i just kept thinking about it
[52:55] all through the week you're just just on
[52:57] my mind just just appreciating the holy
[53:00] spirit ministering
[53:02] you know
[53:07] because if you know
[53:10] who called you
[53:14] when you were called
[53:16] how you were called
[53:18] where you were called
[53:21] and onto what
[53:23] you are called
[53:27] praise the lord
[53:37] okay let's talk about the size of the
[53:39] fight in the dog
[53:42] that's what we want to deal with tonight
[53:43] amen
[53:44] we want to talk about the size of the
[53:47] fight in the dark
[53:49] you know what i've just i just that
[53:51] thought just dropped on my heart
[53:54] and i just i just said well you know i
[53:56] will i will stand with the ukrainian
[53:59] people
[54:00] using that coat tonight to preach
[54:03] it's not the size of the dog but it's
[54:05] the size of the fight
[54:07] that is in the dog
[54:10] amen
[54:11] praise the lord
[54:14] amen
[54:16] we don't preach politics
[54:18] but we preach what is true amen
[54:21] we preach what is true if we preach what
[54:23] is right so you realize here that god is
[54:26] giving you know uh
[54:28] uh uh moses yet is commanding the people
[54:32] and yeah he goes and and you realize
[54:34] this is almost about uh
[54:37] five five times that moses said this you
[54:39] know he keep talking about be courageous
[54:44] amen
[54:47] be courageous
[54:50] because you see you see courage
[54:53] courage is uh
[54:55] it's a wonderful thing
[54:59] what i was telling a little bit i was
[55:00] looking at some some
[55:02] some wonderful quotes on courage
[55:05] someone said being deeply loved by
[55:08] someone
[55:09] gave you strength
[55:12] to know that you are loved
[55:15] by someone
[55:16] it gives you strength
[55:20] why loving someone deeply
[55:24] gives you courage
[55:37] praise the lord
[55:42] sausage is not
[55:44] finer
[55:48] josh hill said this winston churchill
[55:51] he said success is not final
[55:54] failure
[55:56] is not filter
[55:58] it is the courage
[56:00] to continue that count
[56:04] amen
[56:06] any time when people think that they are
[56:08] successful they relax
[56:10] and then the next morning they realize
[56:12] they wake up and realize that they have
[56:14] gone short of their sources
[56:16] then they start again
[56:19] so success is not fun
[56:23] need of failure
[56:24] is filtered
[56:26] what count
[56:27] is the courage
[56:29] to keep fighting
[56:40] praise the lord
[56:45] now because uh uh i mean uh israel was
[56:48] there they were just they were just a
[56:50] group a few people
[56:52] you know group of people we've
[56:54] just imagine these people are coming
[56:56] from on the hands of the egyptian they
[56:58] don't have no no military strength no
[57:01] military tactics
[57:03] and god
[57:05] promised them that they are going to
[57:06] take over
[57:08] yes
[57:09] they are going to take over the land
[57:15] praise the lord
[57:17] they are going to capture the land
[57:18] before jordan and the one after jordan
[57:23] they are going to overcome all these
[57:25] army
[57:29] now just looking at your ability
[57:33] and knowing that these nations are
[57:36] established nations the afghan kings
[57:43] and you're there i mean y'all don't have
[57:44] kings
[57:47] there is one man there with thou said
[57:49] the law that moses and there is other
[57:51] people in this in the very same camp
[57:57] that is fussing
[57:59] they are gossiping
[58:01] they are claiming how to the true moses
[58:03] you are already you already don't have
[58:06] an organized nation you don't have
[58:10] cabinet you don't have soldiers
[58:14] and here you're fussy
[58:19] gossiping who he think he is
[58:25] praise the lord
[58:28] now so if if you look if you look at
[58:30] your ability
[58:32] and look at the promises that is giving
[58:36] it takes one thing
[58:39] to keep dragging you to that promise it
[58:42] takes courage
[58:47] praise the lord
[58:50] it takes courage
[58:54] and i believe that's that's what it it
[58:57] it took for
[58:58] the ukraine people
[59:03] praise civilians
[59:03] lord
[59:05] saw one of the news captions where they
[59:08] lay down before the army tanker
[59:10] say you have to roll over our body
[59:13] if you will enter the city
[59:18] courage
[59:27] that's what it takes
[59:29] praise the lord
[59:32] that's what it takes people
[59:36] amen
[59:37] that's what it takes to stand for god
[59:40] in an evil age like this
[59:45] it take courage
[59:47] it it does not take popu popular opinion
[59:53] not now that not a majority vote
[59:57] of all the people things or what the
[59:59] people say
[1:00:02] and that's the thing that is they're
[1:00:04] slashing people you know left and right
[1:00:06] out of the message they never i mean
[1:00:08] they never god the word never got a hold
[1:00:10] of them anyway
[1:00:11] praise the lord
[1:00:13] because he said i mean if all of these
[1:00:15] people are saying this wish me it must
[1:00:17] be truth
[1:00:23] which means you don't have a revelation
[1:00:25] you don't have a birth
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:29] this thing that we are fighting for that
[1:00:31] we are standing is family value
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:38] it's family value
[1:00:44] kingdom principle
[1:00:48] so god
[1:00:49] moses is telling the people here
[1:00:52] you know he said this day i'm 120 years
[1:00:55] old this day
[1:00:57] and i can
[1:00:59] i can normally go out and come in
[1:01:02] my strength is not like before
[1:01:06] praise the lord
[1:01:08] amen moses moses acknowledging
[1:01:13] that all that he was doing it was
[1:01:15] because of the grace of god that was
[1:01:17] upon his life
[1:01:20] now he's telling them my strength is not
[1:01:22] like before
[1:01:26] and moreover
[1:01:28] the word of the lord
[1:01:31] i will not be able to go
[1:01:34] over jordan
[1:01:36] praise the lord amen
[1:01:39] but there is one thing i want to put in
[1:01:41] your hands
[1:01:43] courage
[1:01:46] moses said it's the only thing i have to
[1:01:48] give you
[1:01:52] because i'm certain that god that made
[1:01:55] the promise would not fail
[1:02:00] god will not fail on his word so the
[1:02:02] only thing i can place in your hands
[1:02:05] tonight
[1:02:06] is courage
[1:02:11] praise the lord
[1:02:12] if you are courageous you will see the
[1:02:14] body change
[1:02:16] if you are courageous you will see the
[1:02:18] rapture
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:21] if you are courageous you will see and
[1:02:23] experience the move of god
[1:02:29] but if you just sit there and say let me
[1:02:31] sit and see
[1:02:35] you know that many people let me let me
[1:02:36] sit and see
[1:02:38] we will see
[1:02:42] if you want to see we say come and see
[1:02:46] oh praise the lord tonight
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:52] glory be to god
[1:03:04] let me just read a little bit of that
[1:03:06] story
[1:03:08] that we all are familiar with
[1:03:12] and
[1:03:16] i mean if you know it when when things
[1:03:19] like this uh uh happening in the world
[1:03:23] you know we we
[1:03:25] we you know look for
[1:03:28] scriptures we look for cults and
[1:03:30] and uh you know to kind of
[1:03:33] frame our standing our understanding
[1:03:35] you know uh and you know and
[1:03:38] and and sometimes
[1:03:40] people
[1:03:42] will make uh
[1:03:43] you know some conclusive statement
[1:03:46] and uh i never never turned to be like
[1:03:49] that don't tell uh maybe unless the lord
[1:03:52] gave me one
[1:03:53] praise lord
[1:03:55] because uh
[1:03:57] you know
[1:03:59] god's ways are past falling out
[1:04:03] you know
[1:04:04] his ways are past fanning out
[1:04:09] his wonders to perform
[1:04:12] praise the lord
[1:04:19] change that's what we need tonight we
[1:04:21] need courage
[1:04:24] praise the lord
[1:04:25] we need courage to stand up to our fear
[1:04:30] we need courage to stand up to our
[1:04:32] sickness
[1:04:33] whatever we are dealing with in our life
[1:04:36] you have to stand up to it
[1:04:39] praise the lord
[1:04:40] because you see god gave these people
[1:04:42] the promise and tore abraham your sea
[1:04:45] was so drawn into a strange land but i
[1:04:48] would bring them out with a mighty hand
[1:04:51] that's god's word he says i will bring
[1:04:55] them out with a mighty hand
[1:04:59] praise the lord but you see in a way
[1:05:01] that the hand of the lord will be
[1:05:04] revealed in the life
[1:05:08] of the people
[1:05:10] god never told him
[1:05:12] now you see a person can take a literal
[1:05:15] understanding and say god says he will
[1:05:17] bring them out with a mighty hand a hand
[1:05:19] will stretch down from heaven and just
[1:05:21] hold us and chunk us over and just pick
[1:05:24] us up and chunk that was not what god
[1:05:26] made
[1:05:31] praise the lord
[1:05:33] the arm of the law was going to be
[1:05:35] revealed in his people
[1:05:39] his strength was going to be make known
[1:05:42] in their weaknesses
[1:05:45] they were going to experience his mercy
[1:05:47] they were going to experience his anger
[1:05:50] his forgiveness
[1:05:55] that was the arm of the lord
[1:06:01] just like the prophet isaiah said who
[1:06:03] has believed our report
[1:06:05] and unto whom is the arm of the lord
[1:06:08] reveal
[1:06:14] it's only the ones that have believed
[1:06:17] the ones that have courage
[1:06:19] to take god at his word
[1:06:22] i don't know how it's going to happen
[1:06:25] but i know who promised it
[1:06:28] i don't know how he's going to bring it
[1:06:30] to pass but i know who said it
[1:06:36] and all i can ask lord gave me grace
[1:06:40] give me courage
[1:06:43] that when i fall and i fail i can get up
[1:06:49] and keep striving
[1:06:59] praise the lord
[1:07:04] amen
[1:07:09] verb talk she had in the message god
[1:07:12] come commissioning moses
[1:07:14] the prophet
[1:07:16] he says
[1:07:17] what
[1:07:18] you got in your hand
[1:07:20] that was the question god asked mostly
[1:07:22] he said a stick
[1:07:24] wasn't very much
[1:07:26] but
[1:07:28] it was a stake
[1:07:30] well you might not have very much in
[1:07:33] your hands tonight
[1:07:36] praise the lord
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:39] now just like we are reading this scene
[1:07:43] of the people
[1:07:45] going to their inheritance
[1:07:47] that's how we must also imagine what is
[1:07:51] playing on the political stage
[1:07:54] just like i said on on on sunday
[1:07:58] it's a political disturbance
[1:08:01] and every political disturbance
[1:08:04] is a trumpet to israel
[1:08:06] right
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:10] god will allow political
[1:08:13] unrest
[1:08:15] to push his people back
[1:08:18] to their homeland
[1:08:27] are we together
[1:08:30] amen
[1:08:31] and just and just and just in the same
[1:08:34] line
[1:08:36] where god will allow
[1:08:38] political disturbance now you see the
[1:08:40] thing about it there is that those those
[1:08:43] people you can can you imagine
[1:08:46] and uh uh uh you know in in in your mind
[1:08:50] i was i was uh
[1:08:52] reading some time ago
[1:08:55] and how uh
[1:08:57] the jews because of all the different
[1:09:00] things that were happening with them you
[1:09:02] know right from the time word
[1:09:05] they say let his blood be on us and all
[1:09:07] the different things the jews they try
[1:09:10] to disguise themselves they try to to
[1:09:13] change their nationality try to look for
[1:09:17] a different name and try you know and
[1:09:20] and all of that
[1:09:23] but in every way that they try to hide
[1:09:26] themselves god will allow something to
[1:09:29] happen
[1:09:32] praise the lord
[1:09:35] amen
[1:09:36] now think let's let's take for example
[1:09:39] the maybe a little family here they
[1:09:42] choose uh uh uh uh to to change their
[1:09:45] name and find a different tribe
[1:09:48] and and and you know and they settle
[1:09:50] down and pretty soon
[1:09:52] god starts blessing them
[1:09:56] amen
[1:09:57] and and and when god stop blessing them
[1:09:59] and start prospering them then what
[1:10:02] happened there is the other uh a draw a
[1:10:06] spirit of jealousy
[1:10:09] because you know it was just say that
[1:10:12] sent them to bondage
[1:10:17] so a draw a spirit of jealousy and then
[1:10:19] the people around them well why their
[1:10:21] family keep prospering where they came
[1:10:23] from
[1:10:25] where descent is from what is their
[1:10:26] tribe then they start looking in their
[1:10:28] history and start tracing and they
[1:10:30] realize that they are not from this
[1:10:32] place
[1:10:38] praise the lord
[1:10:40] then it's just time for jacob to pick up
[1:10:42] his bag and leave again
[1:10:46] then he gets to this other place they
[1:10:48] change their name again
[1:10:53] because you see there's a promise that
[1:10:56] is hovering over them
[1:10:58] and god promised to bless them
[1:11:02] to bless the things that were put in
[1:11:03] their hands and as soon as god start
[1:11:06] blessing them then
[1:11:08] jealousy
[1:11:09] it attracts jealousy
[1:11:14] because
[1:11:17] it was jealousy that took them out of
[1:11:19] their homeland it would take jealousy to
[1:11:21] send them back home
[1:11:25] god will make
[1:11:27] the nations around the family around
[1:11:29] them to be jealous of them persecute
[1:11:32] them for them to go right back home
[1:11:41] praise the lord
[1:11:48] oh my
[1:11:51] why do god we self
[1:11:59] what a god we self
[1:12:08] what's your goal in your hands you said
[1:12:10] a steak wasn't very much estate well you
[1:12:14] might not have very much in your hands
[1:12:17] tonight
[1:12:19] you say well brother branham i can't
[1:12:21] even whistle
[1:12:25] let alone testify well brother
[1:12:28] you can do something
[1:12:30] whatever is in your hand
[1:12:33] get going
[1:12:36] praise the lord
[1:12:38] we are at the roar we are at the end of
[1:12:41] the road brother let's get out here
[1:12:44] tomorrow let's testify to somebody let's
[1:12:47] do something
[1:12:49] about something
[1:12:52] don't stand still
[1:12:54] you say well i have
[1:12:58] been a timid person
[1:12:59] moses said the same thing
[1:13:04] just remind me one time
[1:13:06] uh over
[1:13:08] a football stadium i was preaching him i
[1:13:11] walked in and he said a little sign
[1:13:14] up over there said
[1:13:16] is not the size of the dog in the fight
[1:13:21] is the size of the fight in the dark
[1:13:26] praise the lord
[1:13:28] you see that's what the holy spirit
[1:13:30] brings to the believer
[1:13:31] it brings
[1:13:32] fighting muscles
[1:13:36] it gives you an inner fight something in
[1:13:38] you that just hit this word
[1:13:42] it hits sin it hits every evil
[1:13:46] you don't have the physical power to
[1:13:48] stop it but something you know uh uh uh
[1:13:51] like better brahman says a righteous
[1:13:53] indignation rise in you
[1:13:58] and there are things of yourself you
[1:14:00] just get tired with
[1:14:01] and say lord i'm tired with this thing
[1:14:06] praise the lord
[1:14:09] you know when you fail
[1:14:11] it's when you lose your fighting spirit
[1:14:15] when you lose the will to fight
[1:14:19] that's when you fail
[1:14:23] but a man that fight dying
[1:14:28] die a hero
[1:14:38] oh praise the lord
[1:14:50] all of these uh
[1:14:52] get rich overnight and prosperity gospel
[1:14:55] you know i have just put the people
[1:14:57] robbed them of their fighting spirit
[1:15:00] praise the lord
[1:15:02] amen
[1:15:03] erupt them of their fighting spirit it
[1:15:05] just put them on
[1:15:07] on a gambling wheel
[1:15:09] or the thing they can just cash in some
[1:15:11] money and the money will spin and
[1:15:13] tomorrow they will get rich
[1:15:17] praise the lord
[1:15:19] the churches have just turned to casino
[1:15:24] sure
[1:15:26] well they can bet we'll get the highest
[1:15:28] money we'll give the highest one we'll
[1:15:30] get the highest in a sense that when i
[1:15:32] bet more i will get
[1:15:36] more erupt them
[1:15:41] of the inner ability
[1:15:44] erupt them of courage
[1:15:49] to
[1:15:50] stain for conviction
[1:15:56] praise the lord
[1:15:59] amen
[1:16:01] that brings to mind another thing but
[1:16:04] time will not allow me to go into it
[1:16:08] praise the lord
[1:16:13] because that's what the church is lost
[1:16:14] in conviction
[1:16:20] you have people that don't have a
[1:16:21] conviction
[1:16:24] they don't know why they believe what
[1:16:26] they believe
[1:16:33] they're just
[1:16:34] hoping that one day they will find out
[1:16:44] it's not the size of the dog in the
[1:16:46] fight is the size of the fight in the
[1:16:50] dark
[1:16:51] praise the lord
[1:16:53] and i believe that's that's that's the
[1:16:55] thing that is that is
[1:16:57] that is that is tormenting
[1:16:59] the mind of that russian detector
[1:17:03] because all the thought was they were
[1:17:05] just they would just drive
[1:17:07] their armor tents
[1:17:10] and just put up their flags
[1:17:14] and these people said not this time over
[1:17:16] my dear buddy
[1:17:19] i'd rather be a dead man
[1:17:23] praise the lord
[1:17:29] is that fighting spirit
[1:17:36] the last day christians have lost that
[1:17:40] if we don't have a fighting spirit we
[1:17:42] complain
[1:17:45] we complain
[1:17:46] we try to we we try to look uh
[1:17:49] uh you know uh uh uh uh uh create some
[1:17:53] saying of paycheck for people to feel
[1:17:55] sorry for us
[1:18:02] when when the apostle paul told us that
[1:18:04] uh uh uh the weapons of our warfare
[1:18:08] were not conan
[1:18:11] he told us we are fighting against
[1:18:13] principalities power spiritual weakness
[1:18:17] in high places
[1:18:21] how can you be fighting and don't have a
[1:18:23] fighting spirit
[1:18:25] and don't have nothing in you to fight
[1:18:28] then you are not fighting
[1:18:33] you are just a spectator
[1:18:35] and that's why you can sit there and
[1:18:36] just criticize this one criticize that
[1:18:39] one criticize everybody
[1:18:41] because you're not fighting
[1:18:44] praise the lord
[1:18:45] the guy in the stands he knows how to
[1:18:47] play the game best
[1:18:50] he sits in the stands and says oh my
[1:18:52] goodness
[1:18:53] your life kingdom
[1:19:00] but it's the man that is in the arena
[1:19:05] praise the lord
[1:19:18] if it was me this is what i would do
[1:19:21] just take the a from there
[1:19:24] and get doing it
[1:19:27] if i was the one this is what i would do
[1:19:37] saints
[1:19:39] that's just what we need
[1:19:42] for this age
[1:19:45] this age that is
[1:19:48] oppressed
[1:19:49] with demon power
[1:19:51] demon spirit hovering over the age
[1:19:55] all you need
[1:19:56] is a fighting spirit
[1:20:00] because you have a promise
[1:20:02] that when the weakest child of god
[1:20:06] crawl on their knees
[1:20:09] and get down and cry to god
[1:20:13] heaven years
[1:20:15] all you need is just the courage
[1:20:18] to get on your knees
[1:20:22] all you need is the courage to take the
[1:20:24] name of jesus on your lap
[1:20:27] that's all you need
[1:20:32] just the courage
[1:20:35] right
[1:20:37] to say lord jesus

[1:20:41] i need you
[1:20:52] hmm
[1:21:06] so that's a good idea

[1:21:14] a lot of fight about you
[1:21:17] you got to get into it
[1:21:21] you got to get into it
[1:21:26] you got to get into the worship get into
[1:21:28] the world

[1:21:38] walk in the light
[1:21:40] and move we unfold
[1:21:44] because the light is sent to brighten
[1:21:46] your path
[1:21:50] bubble says anything i hate to see
[1:21:52] is a spineless person
[1:21:58] called himself a christian mind
[1:22:00] god wants somebody
[1:22:03] with a grade in the
[1:22:08] backbone he says
[1:22:11] i like all body robbers and said lord
[1:22:14] give me
[1:22:15] the backbone the size
[1:22:18] of a sore log
[1:22:22] put plenty of knowledge
[1:22:24] in the gable ends of my soul
[1:22:30] and let me fight the devil
[1:22:33] as long as i got one
[1:22:36] tote and then i will gum him
[1:22:40] so wish me if he if he knocks all my one
[1:22:42] thought
[1:22:44] i'm going to gum him
[1:22:48] till i die
[1:22:49] let me
[1:22:51] let me die fighting
[1:23:03] that fighting spirit
[1:23:08] people
[1:23:09] have ever done anything for god in
[1:23:13] humanity
[1:23:15] it took courage
[1:23:21] it took courage
[1:23:22] for nelson mandela
[1:23:26] to cry against apartheid
[1:23:32] they didn't care what it would cost him
[1:23:35] how many years in prison
[1:23:38] but it's the fighting spirit
[1:23:41] that's right
[1:23:44] people want to fight they don't even
[1:23:46] know what to fight for
[1:23:49] right
[1:23:50] you have to be fighting for principle
[1:23:56] there's a little thing happening
[1:23:59] people jump on the street they want to
[1:24:00] riot
[1:24:02] what are they fighting for
[1:24:04] right what are they writing about
[1:24:08] what is the fighting spirit that is in
[1:24:10] them
[1:24:11] it's just to break into people's
[1:24:13] property
[1:24:14] right and loot
[1:24:21] that's that's not fighting
[1:24:40] and that's why the word
[1:24:42] is watching
[1:24:45] i believe that god
[1:24:47] in his in his in his
[1:24:49] sovereign
[1:24:52] knowledge allow it to be like that
[1:25:00] in church those people have a heritage
[1:25:02] with god
[1:25:05] praise the lord
[1:25:08] and in all of israel battle
[1:25:11] whether it was just what it was just a
[1:25:14] jewish boy that was discriminated
[1:25:16] against
[1:25:19] that same pillar of fire
[1:25:22] that led their father
[1:25:24] in the wilderness
[1:25:26] i've always been there with them
[1:25:32] praise the lord
[1:25:33] you see that's that's that's what it is
[1:25:37] when that window when uh when a young
[1:25:39] man and a
[1:25:41] young woman
[1:25:42] take to the word of god
[1:25:44] and says i believe that this is the word
[1:25:46] of god for this day
[1:25:48] every every promise every blessing
[1:25:51] the pill of fire that that the hangover
[1:25:54] brother branham had in eastern
[1:25:57] it is not it it's not gone
[1:26:00] right
[1:26:01] that uh that we only just need the photo
[1:26:04] no it's even it's even with the believer
[1:26:07] today
[1:26:12] the photo is just an is just an
[1:26:15] oddworld witness
[1:26:16] brother branham says it's just a
[1:26:18] testimony to signs
[1:26:22] is testifying to science
[1:26:25] by their own mechanism they were able to
[1:26:27] capture the supernatural
[1:26:30] that's all it is
[1:26:31] is just a witness
[1:26:36] but when he said i will never leave you
[1:26:38] i will never forsake you what was he
[1:26:41] talking about that same pillow of fire
[1:26:44] will go with you wherever you go
[1:26:47] [Music]

[1:26:59] what is right
[1:27:05] even though sometimes it's hard
[1:27:10] praise the lord
[1:27:12] well you have to realize that
[1:27:14] it's not you right
[1:27:16] it's what you are believing is right
[1:27:22] because if you look at yourself and then
[1:27:24] you keep feeling you you would you would
[1:27:27] take your failure
[1:27:29] for the failure of the truth the truth
[1:27:31] never fails
[1:27:35] praise the lord
[1:27:37] but you were born a failure
[1:27:39] and if god doesn't help us we would die
[1:27:41] a failure
[1:27:50] so people take their own failure
[1:27:53] to say the message is not true no it's
[1:27:55] your failure you are the one that have
[1:27:57] failed to believe god you have failed to
[1:28:00] be courageous

[1:28:04] you're taking your fight on the wrong
[1:28:06] side of the camp
[1:28:15] praise the lord
[1:28:19] since i would gum him
[1:28:21] till i die
[1:28:23] and he did that
[1:28:27] that's right i like that he got down
[1:28:31] in the corn field
[1:28:34] and he said lord if you don't give me
[1:28:36] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:39] when you come back to earth
[1:28:43] you're going to fight you're going to
[1:28:44] find a part of bones
[1:28:47] lying right here
[1:28:52] all he was doing was just being
[1:28:54] courageous
[1:28:55] that lord i believe your word brother
[1:28:57] branham said he has such an anger the
[1:29:00] thing that make him to make that
[1:29:02] statement he has such an anger until he

[1:29:13] lord you got to take this thing from me
[1:29:17] he stand up to himself
[1:29:19] and say lord you got to take this thing
[1:29:21] for me i need the holy ghost
[1:29:24] yes
[1:29:37] that's all you need young people
[1:29:41] you just need the courage
[1:29:43] to pick up your bible
[1:29:46] and read
[1:29:49] the courage to just be able to set a
[1:29:52] time aside
[1:29:54] slip away
[1:29:56] and get on your knees
[1:29:57] and say god
[1:30:06] yes that's all you need
[1:30:08] just courage
[1:30:13] and that's what god is witnessing once
[1:30:15] again to the entire world

[1:31:02] in tanner
[1:31:07] you have to build your hopes on things
[1:31:09] intended

[1:31:21] we know the story
[1:31:24] and my little david
[1:31:27] this guy that i would like to talk about
[1:31:29] that story one of these days
[1:31:32] brother mack's little son samuel
[1:31:35] that's his favorite story
[1:31:39] when he takes david and goliath man you
[1:31:41] just you just just get into his word
[1:31:46] just get into samuel's mind and see
[1:31:48] david and goliath

[1:32:10] to go fight a military uh uh a general
[1:32:14] with stones
[1:32:17] it was just courage
[1:32:22] let's not uh you know we can put all the
[1:32:24] supernatural thing five stone j-e-s-u-s
[1:32:28] fire stone f-r-t and david did not know
[1:32:30] none of that
[1:32:36] and david took j-e-s-u-s it's wonderful
[1:32:39] i'm not speaking against it
[1:32:44] it's good for you david did not know
[1:32:46] that
[1:32:52] all all david knew is that
[1:32:54] how can i sit down here i should be a
[1:32:57] dead man
[1:32:59] to see somebody mocking god
[1:33:04] i should be a dead man that's that's why
[1:33:06] he made
[1:33:08] for an uncircumcised philistine
[1:33:11] to challenge the army of the living god
[1:33:17] that's all he had courage
[1:33:23] young people that's that all it takes it
[1:33:26] does not take no in the seventh seal the
[1:33:28] seven mystery and all of these things
[1:33:30] that
[1:33:31] they are beautiful they will come

[1:33:53] serve god because uh your parents are
[1:33:56] coming and
[1:33:57] what what if it is yourself
[1:34:03] what are you going to do
[1:34:15] is having the courage
[1:34:23] once again in simplicity
[1:34:28] god
[1:34:30] explained deuteronomy chapter 31
[1:34:34] before our eyes
[1:34:37] the people
[1:34:39] hearing the voice of moses echoing
[1:34:42] in their subconscious
[1:34:44] be courageous just be strong
[1:34:48] and be courageous
[1:34:55] that's the voices that is that is
[1:34:57] growing out of out of the you know
[1:35:00] the breaks wall
[1:35:05] all they are hearing in their ear is be
[1:35:07] courageous
[1:35:14] and that's all we need
[1:35:17] it's just to be courageous
[1:35:23] have to sit there and complain oh nobody
[1:35:26] oh yeah you know what yes you know and
[1:35:28] we just complain and we just why me why
[1:35:31] me why not you
[1:35:41] if we would just
[1:35:43] realize
[1:35:49] that's where my that's where my burden
[1:35:51] is i believe that's where the the holy
[1:35:52] spirit was dealing with me on that uh
[1:35:55] during your election
[1:35:58] ignoring your calling
[1:36:01] you see all out of this why this is we
[1:36:03] re make your call in the election all
[1:36:05] are we looking for is is what is my
[1:36:08] calling why am i called to do
[1:36:12] when that's not even what the scripture
[1:36:13] is referring to
[1:36:21] i mean
[1:36:22] scripture is just referring to you being
[1:36:23] called as a son of god as a daughter of
[1:36:25] god
[1:36:27] because jesus says my sheep will hear my
[1:36:28] voice
[1:36:33] well you see we have this this whole
[1:36:35] thing in our head we want to do
[1:36:36] something

[1:36:41] is children come unto me
[1:36:45] children come unto me come in love love
[1:36:47] the father get in the relationship

[1:37:20] it's in your nature
[1:37:22] you're looking for it when it's right
[1:37:25] here
[1:37:27] we think it's going to come
[1:37:29] supernaturally and the holy spirit is
[1:37:31] going to reveal to me you call to be a
[1:37:32] prophet
[1:37:36] it's in your nature
[1:37:38] as you fall in love with god amen
[1:37:42] as you fall in love with god
[1:37:45] and you walk with the lord you go right
[1:37:49] into what you are called to do
[1:37:53] whatever
[1:37:55] your calling is so much part of you
[1:38:00] the way to find it
[1:38:03] is to find the things you love to do for
[1:38:06] the lord
[1:38:07] unconsciously
[1:38:10] you you just love it
[1:38:13] unconsciously
[1:38:22] you love the lord tonight

[1:46:59] i mean
[1:47:00] they don't they don't have choice the
[1:47:02] parents can't leave them home
[1:47:05] time for service change their clothes
[1:47:07] whether they want to or not
[1:47:09] all of their friends are playing running
[1:47:11] around the neighborhood they got a dress
[1:47:13] jump in the car and come
[1:47:17] now you just think about it

[1:47:29] none of this become ever real to them
[1:47:40] think about it some
[1:47:44] they walk around their schedule to try
[1:47:46] to do everything
[1:47:48] to be in church
[1:47:53] set up their jobs
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:56] just so they can be able to make it to

[1:48:03] some their job tied them i mean because
[1:48:05] of the hour because of the nature of
[1:48:07] their job

[1:49:07] soon you will get tired
[1:49:10] because your tire might blow up on the
[1:49:12] road

[1:49:18] to a place of shelter and then you ask
[1:49:20] yourself but god why why am i tired blow
[1:49:22] up
