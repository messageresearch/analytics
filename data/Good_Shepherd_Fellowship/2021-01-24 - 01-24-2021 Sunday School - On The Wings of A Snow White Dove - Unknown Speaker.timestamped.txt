[0:27] any denominational doctrines
[0:30] anything in the world it'll say
[0:33] loyal to its mate the word
[0:37] always laurel and by this home-loving
[0:42] conduct
[0:44] by the conduct of its home loving it has
[0:47] been successfully used
[0:50] for a carrier pigeon
[0:54] because it loves home you turn it loose
[0:57] anywhere it'll always go back home
[1:01] it'll go back home we'd like to stress
[1:04] on that a little longer
[1:05] you christians that understand what i
[1:07] mean
[1:09] it always finds its way back home so
[1:11] therefore
[1:12] it's been used for carrier pigeon
[1:15] it's used in time of war used to be they
[1:18] still use them
[1:19] carrier pitches to carry a message
[1:22] so you see then that makes the dove
[1:26] both by god and man a messenger
[1:30] a dove is a messenger it was a messenger
[1:33] to noah
[1:34] to tell noah that there's feasts again
[1:38] it was used by god to vindicate
[1:42] that this was his son the sacrifice
[1:46] to bring peace upon the earth and good
[1:48] will to man
[1:50] it was used as a messenger
[1:53] right here i have a little story in my
[1:56] mind i read one time out of a book
[1:58] now i don't want to say this as sure
[2:02] it may be in the decline of the first
[2:04] world war
[2:06] i'm not positive of that now if you miss
[2:08] seeing it then i'm wrong
[2:09] i either read the books been many years
[2:11] ago but it was certainly a really
[2:14] a dramatic thing that happened
[2:18] the american soldiers was pinned down by
[2:21] german machine gun fire
[2:24] and they were in kind of a pit you
[2:26] soldiers
[2:27] i guess understand how they were on a
[2:29] reconnaissance somewhere and it
[2:30] was pinned down and they had just a
[2:34] little bit of ammunition left
[2:36] and the germans was moving in
[2:39] great units moving in everywhere
[2:43] and they knowed that unless they get
[2:45] some reinforcement
[2:47] some help that they would soon all die
[2:51] they had to the germans coming right
[2:53] down off the mountains
[2:54] looking right down their neck going
[2:55] right into them like that
[2:58] and one of them happened to remember
[3:00] that he had
[3:01] a little mascot
[3:04] a little pigeon
[3:08] so he knew that this pigeon if it could
[3:10] get out of there
[3:12] would carry the message to the main
[3:14] headquarters
[3:16] to where they'd been stationed and so
[3:18] they sat down
[3:20] and wrote on a note we are
[3:23] pinned down in a certain position at a
[3:26] certain area
[3:28] we're out of ammunition
[3:31] a few hours we'll have to surrender or
[3:34] either
[3:34] we'll be massacred and they pin this
[3:38] or tied it on the foot of this little
[3:41] dove
[3:43] and turning loose now he's a home loving
[3:47] bird
[3:47] so he what does he do he takes back home
[3:50] for his
[3:50] feet find his mate she was worried about
[3:54] him
[3:55] he'd have to come back home and as he
[3:58] went up
[3:59] the germans seen what had happened
[4:02] so the thing they'd done they started
[4:03] shooting at the dove
[4:06] and one of them hit him with the
[4:10] 30 caliber machine gun or bullet it
[4:12] broke his leg
[4:14] another torn big hunk out of his back
[4:17] his
[4:17] chest was bruised all the way across
[4:21] one of his wings just crippled the ends
[4:22] shot off of it
[4:24] and he flew sideways but he kept
[4:28] climbing
[4:31] finally he made it
[4:34] crippled wounded
[4:38] broken bruised
[4:41] but he fell in the camp with the message
[4:48] hallelujah that was a great day
[4:52] but oh brother
[4:55] isaiah 53 tells us of one
[5:00] came down from home and all that was
[5:03] good
[5:06] and he was wounded for our
[5:08] transgressions
[5:10] he was bruised for our iniquity
[5:13] the testament of our peace is upon him
[5:15] and with his stripes
[5:16] we were healed sickness
[5:20] superstition and devils had us pinned
[5:22] down
[5:24] there was no way out the church had gone
[5:27] wrong
[5:27] that went off on denominational things
[5:31] and
[5:32] pharisees sadducees and washing of pots
[5:35] and pans and the word of god become of
[5:36] no effect
[5:39] but this little dog came down
[5:43] and there's only one thing could take
[5:45] place
[5:46] there had to be a redeemer but being
[5:49] wounded
[5:50] broken beaten
[5:54] torn but he knows his way back home
[6:01] so from calvary's cross where they
[6:03] bruised him
[6:04] mashed him tore him like a bunch of
[6:08] wolves upon him
[6:10] he made his flight from calvary then
[6:13] landed in heaven's doors
[6:15] saying it's finished it's finished
[6:17] [Applause]
[6:19] they're free sickness can be healed now
[6:25] sinners can be saved the captain can be
[6:29] set free
[6:31] though he was bruised and wounded
[6:34] that great battle there when even
[6:36] everything against him
[6:38] even the point cried out mid-rendering
[6:41] rocks and darkening skies
[6:43] my savior bowed his head and died but
[6:45] the opening veil revealed the way
[6:48] to heaven's joy and endless days
[6:55] i've been a neurotic all my life
[6:58] as a little boy there was something
[7:00] struck me
[7:03] i'd scare me about every seven years it
[7:05] would happen to me

[7:15] day that juanita hemphill

[8:18] down there great things that took place
[8:22] coming up the road just as happy as i

[8:27] a year later before i entered the field

[9:33] examination he said they'll find what
[9:34] your trouble is
[9:36] wife and i and becky back there
[9:40] sarah was a little bitty fella i was
[9:42] just entering my healing ministry
[9:44] and we took off to males i went through
[9:47] the clinic
[9:48] and the night before i find i had my
[9:52] finals the next morning
[9:54] i just woke up and staying on the bed
[9:57] looking around
[9:59] and i looked out in front of me and
[10:00] there was a little boy look just like me
[10:03] about seven years old and looked at it
[10:05] and it was me
[10:08] and it's standing by an old snag tree
[10:11] and on that tree any of you squirrel
[10:13] hunters though you can rub a stick up
[10:15] and down on a tree like that and a scare
[10:16] squirrel and run running out if he's in
[10:17] the holler
[10:19] and i was seen there where that squirrel
[10:21] had been and i thought what kind of
[10:22] squirrel is that and i rubbed it
[10:24] and when i did i looked over it and it
[10:26] was me then about 38 years old
[10:28] the little boy was gone so i rubbed that
[10:31] limb and out of that hollow log
[10:35] pole come a little squirrel about that
[10:38] long
[10:38] dark almost black and look like little
[10:41] uh currents flying from him little bitty
[10:44] beady eyes a wickedest looking thing
[10:46] that i ever seen look like a weasel
[10:48] more than a squirrel and he looked right
[10:51] at me
[10:52] and i opened my mouth and said well and
[10:54] what i did
[10:56] before you could have batted your eye he
[10:59] flew right into my
[11:00] mouth went down into my stomach and just
[11:01] tearing me to pieces
[11:04] and as i come out of the vision with my
[11:06] hands up look at the winter screaming oh
[11:08] god i have mercy
[11:10] it's killing me i heard a voice way down
[11:12] in the room say
[11:13] remember it's only six inches long
[11:17] how many heard that story i've told you
[11:18] that many times the people around heaven
[11:22] well on and on it went suffering just
[11:26] the same
[11:27] mayo brothers the next day exam he said
[11:30] your father was an
[11:31] irishman you dream you're a mother
[11:34] being a half indian that makes you
[11:36] almost a half breed
[11:38] so you be you you're just such a nervous
[11:40] wreck until you'll never be out of it
[11:43] said otherwise you're healthy but that
[11:46] that's something in the soul that man
[11:48] cannot
[11:48] control said you will said when a man
[11:51] dies can hold autopsy because his soul's
[11:53] gone
[11:54] he says we will never get over it and
[11:56] that guy said my
[11:58] old doctor said my father had he died at
[12:00] about 85 90 years old
[12:01] somewhere along there he said it said a
[12:03] month or two before he died i examined
[12:04] him had to all his life he get
[12:06] said spell some people said they get
[12:08] high tempered
[12:10] so that's the kind that'll kill you you
[12:12] said the other kind
[12:13] like women in menopause that cry you got
[12:17] the kindest kind of a weary feeling he
[12:19] said
[12:19] the old timers just called had the blues
[12:21] it wouldn't leave them
[12:23] so when that hitch it your stomach sours
[12:25] you're just upset
[12:26] i said but sir i don't you know i said
[12:28] i'm happy said that's right
[12:29] that's just how the human grab bag said
[12:32] you'll always have it
[12:34] oh what a discouraging thing but the
[12:36] words are thinking remember
[12:38] it's only six inches long that's wrong
[12:40] with me as my dear wife becker can tell
[12:42] you
[12:43] year after year i thought of that
[12:46] and then going overseas this last time i
[12:49] was before
[12:50] well i was back home i was on a squirrel
[12:53] hunting trip i jumped out of the car
[12:54] with brother banks woods who's listening
[12:56] in tonight
[12:58] i started round the hill and looked like
[13:00] my heart would jump out of me
[13:03] i asked dr sam adair i said what does
[13:06] that
[13:07] he said next time you have it get a
[13:08] cartogram it's all right
[13:11] so it happened again the next year
[13:14] and when i took the cartogram and said
[13:16] nothing wrong with your heart
[13:17] and you're just nervous start coming on
[13:20] man
[13:21] well another doctor said to me a good
[13:24] friend of mine said
[13:25] that's your heart boy said you better be
[13:28] careful
[13:29] that's a year i'll call brother moore
[13:31] and he got somebody preaching my stead
[13:33] when i went on that ram hunt with
[13:35] brother fred
[13:36] i go up over mountains just like i did
[13:37] was 16 years old
[13:39] a mile after my running never bothered
[13:42] me a bit
[13:43] i come back told sam he said well
[13:45] there's something wrong you better be
[13:46] careful
[13:48] then i saw a vision of an old doctor
[13:51] standing with those
[13:52] old-fashioned doctor with some steer
[13:53] scopes over his arm
[13:55] he said you stand in front of me one day
[13:57] he said don't let him tell you that's
[13:58] your heart that's your stomach
[14:02] or i thought well i'll just take that
[14:04] word because it was a vision
[14:06] come on i started africa to get some
[14:08] shots i had to take a bunch of shots
[14:10] before going to africa that's the law
[14:13] so when i was getting these shots he
[14:15] said well i can't find one thing wrong
[14:16] with you
[14:17] that your hemoglobin your blood is 96
[14:19] and 76.
[14:21] said if you're 16 years old it wouldn't
[14:22] be anymore it wouldn't be any better
[14:24] and said hard enough to beat you 100
[14:26] years lungs
[14:27] everything said you're all right no
[14:29] sugar nothing i said thank you so i got
[14:31] a physical
[14:32] test and and to take my health
[14:35] certificate
[14:35] to the board so uh he said
[14:39] you know anything but i said nothing but
[14:40] persistent souring in the stomach
[14:42] all the time he said well i'll tell you
[14:45] he said uh
[14:45] i said well i've been examined i've been
[14:47] to mayo brothers and everywhere he said
[14:48] but wait a minute
[14:49] he said sometimes the ulcer is so little
[14:52] that that barren meal won't show it
[14:53] and sometimes it's too big to show it
[14:55] because an x-ray is only
[14:57] a shadow a little bitty ulcer you can't
[14:59] see they want enough stick
[15:00] a whole lot of little bitty ulcers could
[15:02] do that he said i know
[15:04] an old doctor up here that's found an
[15:06] instrument they got it now
[15:08] they can put you to sleep with a little
[15:09] sodium and penethol put a tube in your
[15:12] throat
[15:12] and they just actually look down in your
[15:14] stomach and see what's wrong said he
[15:16] said he's your type of people he's a
[15:18] christian
[15:19] he said why don't you go see him i talk
[15:21] his name dr van ravensworth
[15:23] so when i come back i went up to see the
[15:25] old doctor
[15:26] oh he's a fine old man from dutchy
[15:28] cindy's i have a big line of
[15:30] missionaries and
[15:30] he'd hurt him and read my book and oh he
[15:33] just shook my hand he said brother brown
[15:34] i'd be glad to do that for you he said
[15:37] what dude
[15:38] next week you roll up the hospital over
[15:39] here and said
[15:41] and called me up before you go and said
[15:42] i have to give you a little shot of
[15:43] pentothal
[15:44] and said then what did you say to punch
[15:45] your sleep for five minutes
[15:47] my little girl had just tucked it i have
[15:49] a tooth pull and brother
[15:51] norman's little girl at five minutes
[15:52] sleep i thought that won't bother me
[15:54] so i thought i'd be satisfied then to
[15:56] look at it
[15:57] and then the next morning i raised up in
[16:00] the bed
[16:02] i looked around and looked over at the
[16:03] twin bed my wife over there and
[16:05] woke up yet
[16:06] i was looking out the window towards the
[16:08] great catalina mountains
[16:10] there where i lived i looked up there
[16:12] where the angel of the lord put that
[16:13] sword in my hand
[16:14] or the seven angels that you see in the
[16:16] picture appeared great things taking
[16:18] place
[16:18] and i looked and i was look there i was
[16:21] standing
[16:22] by that tree again
[16:25] right where that squirrel was
[16:28] i looked up there i thought that's that
[16:30] squirrel's damn
[16:32] i don't wonder if he's still up there in
[16:35] the vision
[16:36] i raked the side of the tree how'd he
[16:37] come
[16:39] and before i could even back my eye is
[16:42] the oddest looking squirrel i've ever
[16:43] seen now you have to know my ministry to
[16:45] know these symbols
[16:47] he jumped at me but he missed me he
[16:50] missed my mouth
[16:51] hit on my chest and fell off and as soon
[16:54] as he did
[16:55] i heard something said go to the
[16:57] catalina mountains
[17:00] so i turned around i said meaty are you
[17:02] awake honey
[17:04] i woke her up she said what's matter
[17:06] about five o'clock in the morning
[17:08] i said i was looking out here and i saw
[17:10] that squirrel again honey
[17:12] what squirrel i said when i seen up
[17:14] there at mayo's i said you know what
[17:16] he missed my mouth this time he never
[17:18] hit me he went out
[17:20] on my chest i said praise be to god
[17:23] i've looked well since a little boy
[17:27] i have long to see that happen
[17:31] if i could ever see that happen not even
[17:33] before i know what a vision was
[17:35] if i could ever see that happen then i
[17:37] said i'd be all right whatever that told
[17:39] me that's what i'd be
[17:40] and for 40 years i've looked for that
[17:45] and there it happened before
[17:48] when i was at mayo's the same time i was
[17:51] up there when they gave me that
[17:52] message and i saw the vision my old
[17:55] mother's gone on the glory now very odd
[17:58] woman
[17:59] she had about three or four dreams in
[18:00] her life they were always true
[18:03] she'd tell me she started to tell me i
[18:06] i'd say stop right mama tell what the
[18:07] rest of it is
[18:08] because always when you give me a dream
[18:10] to interpret
[18:11] you don't always tell me just exactly
[18:13] what it is then when i see it over again
[18:16] i see exactly what you dreamed about
[18:18] then he tells me what it is
[18:20] see you don't have to tell me what the
[18:21] dream is he shows me the dream himself
[18:25] and then i see i said you didn't tell me
[18:26] this and tell me that see
[18:28] and so the god that can interpret a
[18:30] dream can shoulder him
[18:31] you show honey get interpreted and so
[18:34] then what was he something like that in
[18:36] the bible said if you can i just have to
[18:38] come to me
[18:39] daniel wasn't it no joseph
[18:43] joseph i want somewhere in the bible i
[18:44] just remember that that if you can show
[18:46] me
[18:47] you can tell me what a horse king
[18:48] nebuchadnezzar that's right i said if
[18:50] you can
[18:51] if you can't the magician said tell me
[18:53] the dream
[18:54] he said it's gone from me that's right
[18:57] that i remember that
[18:59] just thought of it then now i notice
[19:02] and mama she said billy when i come back
[19:05] she said come here son and sit down.
[19:08] she said i had a strange dream i dreamed
[19:11] that i've seen you laying
[19:12] sick just about to die
[19:15] with your stomach as usual how many
[19:18] dices she cooked me and she said you
[19:21] were building a house up on a hill
[19:24] and said i've seen six white doves
[19:28] come down from heaven cooting in the
[19:30] letter s
[19:32] and they set up on your chest and you

[25:50] against that and pray
[25:51] god in heaven knows this is true i laid
[25:54] my hands against the rock and looked up
[25:55] towards heaven and started praying
[25:57] i heard a voice coming out of the top of
[25:58] the rocks there said what are you
