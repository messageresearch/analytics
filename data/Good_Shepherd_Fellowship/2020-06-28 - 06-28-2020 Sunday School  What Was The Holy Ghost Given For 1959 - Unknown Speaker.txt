TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] see brother Neville bleezin laying on of hands I see it got a couple of questions now I'll get these tomorrow night calls I don't have time to look through them tonight for you and perhaps on last night's message now if any one has a question on angel message just lay them up one night and I can pick them up the next night now tomorrow night I would like to find or have rather some ministers if possible if not some good solid man or women that we could call on in the time of need that in the event tomorrow night we start after the message to laying on hands and for the Holy Spirit and then there'll be a you have your privilege of staying right here if you wished you all through the holidays if it takes that long to die and then then if not if you desire to go to your own home while we would be glad if you get in a place where you just don't know where to go we want to get some ministers their numbers if their visitors their numbers where they're staying and where we could get a hold of them right away and get one in one home one in another one another that they could give you instructions you are going to seek for this great blessing that we're talking about the baptism of the Holy Spirit last night we were speaking what it was what was the Holy Spirit and we found it to be just about everything that God promised to us in it we found just what God's church would need we found it to be a seal a comforter the rest and the joy and the peace and the resurrection and all that God promised to his church lays within the holy spirit and now tonight we want to preach on or talk on teach on I have about three or four sheets of texture or scriptures on it and which last night I left my Cruden's concordance laying here and I didn't get it and I just had to go through the best I could today with the scriptures now and tomorrow tonight we're teaching off what was the purpose of God sending the Holy Spirit what's it for if it's such a great thing then why did God send it then tomorrow night we want to talk on is it for you and how do you get it and how do you know when you've got it and then after we get through that with the Scriptures explained it by the scriptures using the scriptures for all things then those who are seeking the Holy Spirit will come forward then and then I hope the revival zone from that own to move on then with the Holy Spirit now being at tomorrow night many might stay quite a while at the rooms in the church I feel that if we could get as many ministers and those people who are experienced and leading people to receive the Holy Spirit to encourage them to go into the home with a woman and her husband are or with someone that's seeking the Holy Spirit that's well instructed on what to do if you would just give your phone number or address to the pastor tonight or tomorrow night just give it to brother Neville then that's save us gathering in for a meeting just give your phone number or we could reach you and then say I'll be available and if we want to place me into a home if it's a woman alone then we could send a woman sing to this woman and then if it's in a home where there's a man his wife why we could send a minister and we'd be glad to have you to cooperate because I know you're everyone interested in this this most essential and remember he that saves a soul from his era has covered a multitude of sin see and the Bride of Christ is hungered and thirsting she's in travail to give birth to the children of God now tonight before we read the scriptures let us bow our heads just a moment for prayer and just before we pray you with your heads bowed would you have a request just raise your hands and say God I solemnly raised my hands I have need I pray that you'll help me O Lord God bless each of you he sees your hands the Angels have taken their requests down and a heavenly father we now come approaching thee again in prayer which no doubt that prayer has already been made among the children of God tonight in this little place and it's songs have been sung and we have lifted hearts and joyful rejoicings at the praises of God David said he would come into the congregation of the saints and make his requests known and tonight there has been many hands perhaps maybe I would say 80% of those that are sitting in this building tonight raise their for request shows Lord that we just can't go without you we've got to have you day by day you are our life our joy our health our sustaining strength our stay our buckler our shield from the enemy and we just could not fight this battle of life without you it would be totally impossible for us to do it and we have to totally rely upon you for we know that we're walking to a dark and dismal land on every side the enemy has beset us on givin traps and snares our paths larger set full of snares of the enemy to upset us and we to know at the end of the road we got that long shadowy Valley called death to walk through Oh Lord who would hold our hands then we want to know you now Lord we want to know that you've got our hands and we got your hand that we can have that anchored assurance that when we come to that last great moment of our life that either into that door called death that we can say with the saint of old I know him in the power of his resurrection now I know that when he calls I'll come out from among the dead now father God we would pray that you bless our requests in our gathering bless our words and if I should say anything that would be contrary to your word are your will thou still has a power to close the mouth as you did in the din of lines when Daniel was present and we pray Lord that you would open ears and hearts tonight that and create in them a hunger and thirst may they be so thirsty that they cannot sleep our rest nowhere until the comforter has come we believe that we are living in the last days in the shadow of his coming that's what these messages are directed to Lord it's far the people to take heed take warning and maybe tonight we just pull off the shell right now lit over on the side of the bench said Lord God I am a receptacle to you let your spirit surge through me mold me and make me after that I will I'll yield my heart my strength my all to thy call your ass Lord we not here to be seen on this rainy night we are not here just for no place else to go we are here for one solemn sacred holy purpose in our hearts that is to draw nigh unto you knowing that you've promised if we would draw nigh unto you you draw nigh unto us and that's why we are here he that comes in hungry will not go out hungry blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness said Jesus far they shall be filled and if we ask for bread we will not receive a stone we have that assurance and if we ask for fish we will not receive a serpent but God our Father will feed us with the manna of heaven his word and his spirit that bear record of him answer our prayers Lord in our requests as we further wait on thee in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] now you that's keeping these scriptures down if you would turn with me to st. John again the fourteenth chapter we want to begin at the 14th chapter of st. John and let's start about the 14th verse Saint John 14:14 and just read a post to this scripture now in this you will find much of the texted on won't to speak on tonight and remember you that have the red letter Bibles it's in red this is it's the words that Jesus himself spoke on so therefore we can rest assure that it will be just as he has said heavens and earth will pass away but his word shall never fail now we shall read from the fourteenth verse of the fourteenth chapter if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it what a blessed promise if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not now you that would be reading from a Greek Bible would see it in your not see their means to understand for the world understandeth him not that is so true let me read it again now even the Spirit of Truth who the Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him who the comforter for he dwelleth with you now present tense he dwelleth with you and shall be in you what is it the same comforter I will not leave you comfortless ah anyone knows that I is a personal pronoun I will come to you get a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall but ye see me because I live ye shall live also that that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you there's going to be the center of my thought but we're going to read a little farther let me read that also now again at that day the great day the Judgment Day that day you shall know that I am in the father and he and me and I in you he that has my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas said unto him not is a carrot Lord how is it that thou will manifest ourselves to us and not to the world that's cosmos a world order if you got a larger eating there you'll notice mines of G and says over your cosmos our world system that's churches and so forth how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to them how can you do it jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sans you might keep the church's sayings but keep his sands easy and the words which ye hear is not mine but the father which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all these things that's his words to your remembers whatsoever I have said unto you what purpose did God send the Holy Spirit then may add his blessings to his words Jesus said that at that day you'll know that I am in the father and the father is in me and you're I'm in you and you're in me now if we were going to say this now remember this is going to be on tape our Christian businessman out of Louisville called me a while ago and he said it's a shame Billy that these messages like you said last night doesn't get to 40,000 here instead of a hundred and fifty two hundred three hundred people at your little tabernacle I said sir in six months from now Jesus Terry the whole world around will hear this damn tape school all over the world all around and therefore we are teaching here now just what we believe to be truth and what we have found out that God has confirmed it to us to be true now the purpose what was what was God's purpose in sending the Holy Spirit our mark got down John 14 beginning at the fourteenth person reading through the chapter or the basis God's purpose we find here in sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church now we know what the Holy Spirit is we found out last night that it's gone now when we think of God the Father as Jesus spoke of here his father God the Son as Jesus God the Holy Spirit as what we call it today now that does not mean that there is three individual distinct gods it means that there is one God in three offices may we say it like this all that God was he poured into Christ because he emptied himself and poured it into Christ and Christ was the Onis of the Godhead bodily all that Jehovah was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church not into one individual but into the entire body there were we come together in unity we have power all that God was was in Christ and all that Christ was is in you for God was made flesh and dwelt among us 1st Timothy 3:16 if you're putting it down without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh we handling God Jehovah made flesh and walked on the earth and we saw him with her eyes you know in the same chapter of John 14 Phillips said Lord show us the father and it will satisfy us Jesus said I've been so long with you Philip and you don't know me when you have seen me you have seen the father and why sailor style unto me show us the father God was made flesh now here it is the father was God over you we're saying we've been since Adam God the Father was over Moses and the children of Israel in a pillar of fire then God with us in Christ walk with us talk with us eat with the slept with us guard over us God with us and now God in us all God was come into Christ all Christ was come into the church what is it God working in you and he were in a world he want to call on your right there working in you to do his good will how we are to thank God for them God the Holy Spirit is sent for the purpose of God living in his church moving to each age working out his divine will when man make fun of you they're not making fun of you they were making fun of him that sent you so jesus said blessed are ye when men shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my namesake blessed are you and again all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution for when God made himself known in Christ they hated him who hate him worst the church the church hated him worse they hated him worse than to the drunkard they hated him worse than all the other people it was a church that hated him so therefore when you see cosmos the world are the world noti'm not means the church so call knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as did receive him to them gave he the power to become sons of God to them have believed on his name all how we should love him and worship Him the purpose of God wanting to become in fellowship like before we leave that text let's use this in the days of Ruth in the law of redemption when neo mahat the country because of trial hard times she went into the mobile night land which were just lukewarm nominal Christians because the mova nights come from the daughter of lot and they were so-called believers and mixed up and then her husband died and her two sons died and on the road home neoman Ruth neo my honor at home heard one of her daughter-in-laws Orpah she said that she would return back to her country to her gods into her church and to her people and the oume tried to get Ruth to go back but she said your people are my people your God is my God where you die there I'll die where you're buried there I'll be buried not turn back that's when a person's caught evasion no mega-diverse whatever people said you're going over there to become a holy roller something that didn't make any difference to Ruth there was a purpose of God to be fulfilled and just as sure as you're hungry tonight for the holy spirit it's something in you pulling you that a purpose of God in your life has got to be fulfilled just like it was with Ruth the story so beautiful I just can't leave it for a moment you know the law of redemption that went boys you know the story of how Ruth gleaned in the field and found favor with Boaz and before he could marry her he had to redeem all that knee OMA had lost and the only one that could redeem me almost fallen estate in the law of redemption was a near kinsman had to be kinfolks before he could redeem and that was her closest kin folks and he had to make a public in sign outside of the gate or public confession that he had redeemed all that knee OMA had lost and Boaz did it by taking off his shoe before the elders instead of there's anybody here that's got anything that belongs to the OMA this day have redeemed it and that soy God did follow his own laws God cannot follow give you one law to follow him follow another he follows his own laws then God in order to redeem the last church the last world the lost creation God who is infinite in spirit to redeem the loss human race God himself become kinfolks a man a son that he created in the womb of Mary and then he made an ensign or a testimony outside the gates of Jerusalem he was lifted up between the heavens and earth and died and redeemed everything and bleeding he sanctified a church that he himself might live in in fellowship and commune with that lost spot of fellowship from the Garden of Eden where God came down every evening church time did you notice God came down in the cool of the day the setting of the Sun there's something about when he starts to get night people think of church and of God Christians you see the Sun setting you realize that your Sun is setting I did the cool evening he come down and commune with them and there he lost that fellowship because seed will not let him do it and then he was made flesh and dwelt among us in order that he could come back again to man and live in man and restore man to a state of communion with him again and give him back his god-given right that's what he did that's the purpose of the holy ghost it's the father again God the Father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your foul and loss brother and sister giving you his spirit in his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam where art thou that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman when it strikes into their heart and takes its abode there's a thirst and a hungry force all souls that's what's the matter with the meetings today there's not enough spirit touch in it Gold for the souls of the lost and the dying it's more to make a name our church or a building our denomination instead of a soul-winning program how pitiful we just stay on it much God poured himself into Christ correct Christ poured himself into the church therefore now watch at that day you will know that I am in the father and you are in me and I am in you and that day you'll know it for it's the whole thing is one plan of redemption coming down that God coming back to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions gets his church to a place that he could flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship and thou , Eden he'll take his church back to an Eden again there or it fell it no that's work made its first start of fall There s word will be taken right back with every clean slate of redemption bringing them straight back to that place again the church has been in the world for some time and the church really after the Reformation of 1500 years of dark ages Luther was the first reformer to come forth after the round of the Apostles I then when Luther come forth God tipped up a little bit of the spirit and poured it out upon the church in justification and then in the days of Wesley he poured out a little more of yourself into sanctification and as the age has grown on to the end time God has been filling his church just look around and find out if that's true or not look at the Lutheran age you who read history look at their revival and what they did look how much greater the Wesley revival was how much more power they had but in the minority watch in the days of Pentecost what a revival they had Dan what a great wide sweeping to our Sunday visitor the Catholic paper give confession that the Pentecostals produced 1,500,000 conversions in one year I've done over the rest of churches together the Catholic only changed claim the million in their own Sunday visitor the paper called the Sunday visitor gave statement that the Pentecostals outrun them and remember a Pentecostal conversion just holy ghost few conversions in the minority to start with on the side of the alley out there with a low get tired and women couldn't even afford a pair of stockings laying out on the railroad tracks and picking up corn and mash it and making bread for their children but once it come to the most powerful standing Church in the world a not in the eyes of the world but in the eyes of God because he proves it but what he's doing for him he's pouring yourself into him pouring it in notice down what taken place God pouring yourself into them now the church has got to a place from Luther Wesley and the revival zones the Pentecost and now into this age that we're coming now by the same Holy Spirit just more of it now when them Luther's back there got saved they got a potion of the Holy Spirit when the Methodists got sanctified that was a work of the Holy Spirit see it was a part of the Holy Spirit they without us are not made perfect says the scripture see now God as the life has begin to shine in the last days he is expecting us a great thing from us because for there's much given there's much required so he's going to require much more of us than it is of the Luthor's of the Methodist because we walk in a greater light with a greater power whether graters a greater a witness then they had now we have a greater witness of the resurrection we have things more firmer more sure than they had but it's just like I said to a Lutheran College that long gold they said what have we got I said a man plaintiff II lakorn the first little blades come up he said thank the Lord for a grip a crop of corn potentially he had it but he only had it in the early farm by-and-by become a stalking a tassel come out on it which was Methodist if you watch nature you'll see God working there's a secret lies there that even goes with my ministry thing that watching nature CI does what age and what time you see where you're living watch the age now then the Methodists they were tussles they look back to the Luther's that we got sanctification you haven't gotten up and in it by and by from that pollen from the Methodists come forth a grain of car here [Music]
