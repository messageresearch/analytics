========================================

[Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] so without any further hesitation of me I'm just going to turn the over again [Music] I just like to make an announcement man let me study here if you think of them yeah I certainly enjoyed being here every time our journey is getting close to the end now of us staying with you because we got another meeting coming up right away in Chicago and I've got to have this um the family back in Arizona pretty soon and um they've never had their Summer's vacation yet and I'm supposed to take them for a little ride somewhere in a few days and then I'll probably be a wave one one day one of the Sundays and then the following week off again in Chicago then I got to come right straight back on a Monday and take them to Arizona and now uh I just think to come in of a Sunday morning take that a time where everybody's refreshed Sunday night you're always tired and wore out on Sunday night and turn the Sunday night service over to our pastor that's uh that's a very high band but um I hate to do that so yes on Sunday night I would um uh Sunday night to have a service Sunday night and a hold of people so late many of them come in here from way down in the South and and Way North and they have all sometimes to drive day and night just to get here for one service then go back and that's the reason I try to make it on Sunday morning when I come give them a chance to go back loyal faithful pilgrims amen I appreciate him the drive-through sleet rain and everything else to get here across the country hundreds of miles just for one little circle so uh it makes me feel grateful to God and to these people or their great for their great support and what I'm trying to tell to the people to be the truth and I believe this is the truth yeah all my heart if there was anything different that I thought was better I'd certainly first go I won't ask anybody to go anywhere last don't go first to find out what it's right enough I will ask any person who says in God that I had no name and know that's the truth first it must be the word of the Lord then I'm a step and see if it's right and then at the tripod I ain't say come on up this way see it's making the way he's supposed to be a leader a leader of people not speak something if he would put his hand on himself we should go into the leaders of other people this morning I had a very odd peculiar experience Here In a Pulpit and that was about uh the last part of the message I wasn't aiming to say it that way but uh I guess it's already said there's nothing I can do about it now but then I got home got studying about it and had a little family reunion today of just my brother and them mama's gone and we used to meet at her house and now it would go up to Dolores we had a nice time up there this afternoon and talking and said he was long we sang some songs played some hymns and names now I think maybe uh next Sunday morning if the Lord is willing if the brother never would also I'd like to have a heating service just just dedicated only to Healing yes and um I think with the message this morning the ways the Lord seemed to leave me to bring it bring it out also the Italian courageous so to conceit it's a I really believed we are we play around and we we take different things and talk about them but then when it comes to Showdown that's something different as the [Music] telling I believe it was my brother back there telling a little story today about a man a minister and his son that one of his congregations he said he could walk along he said pastor sure the Lord's with you he said I can pack them all over across my back when I go across and share the Lords with you and he went and done he said I can pack along wheel a wheelbar across the same time sure Pastor Lords with your faith can do anything he said I can put you in the Wheel bar and pack the log he said wait a minute it's different when you're including it yourself now that's it's my good first to say here amen It's mighty good for us to say I believe that's true but then put it in action that's right is that put an action as a brought that statement this morning the people is laying in the shadow of Peter they never even asked for prayer I've went into many homes watching this pray before goal he's going there with an awning and don't even praise the people walk out in their heels amen amen I've seen it done so many times see you've got to have somewhere to place your faith yeah you got to believe it and um I believe it's in our approaching and now he is I realized that this was not a tate service they might make a little one for themselves but this is not a tape that goes out across the uh the this one I was speaking of this morning has brought us right up to Climax and that's reason I'm going to take next Sunday for uh uh a healing service because the sense of in home I've told you about divisions and what happened and everything and brought it up why I've done all these things and then this morning bring it right up now to that last Pokemon now it's my time for consecrations of God God's time to speak to me I I must just have a little change in my own life that are not as I think that I'm wicked but I want to feel a little more closer to people see the people that I have tried to tell the this gospel truth to and they turn their back on walkway and laugh at it now that seems like it's an insult I don't care to me but to the things that I've been saying it's a true trying to help them like shoving out a boat and say here here just cross over here get out of that swelling stream you're going to die you're going to Parry said and they're just laugh at you and walk away well to me it feels like if they walk away there's nothing more I can do about it see that I can do but I want to run down the bank now and persuade him to come on back yeah vehicle I know there's somebody out there that hasn't come in yet and I'm going to fish tell us uh he says a nice fish is called now and now in order to do this I'm expecting there's something to happen in a prayer meeting something and many of you remember the vision of the of the last full full third full rather you remember there was something happened just before that I've seen that light come and go down into that place instead of I'll meet you there uh I'm looking for something to happen you're years ago it used to be that the services and that discernment that make me so we God stagger many of you remember that this gets a spot that's standing up had Jack Moore on one arm and brother Brown on the other and brought me up down the street per hour after service and I just had trying to think of where where I was at and what was taking place and then all night lay there and think of it and stop and everything else and more quality this accept our lord Jesus then he told me the vision one time you'll meet a lady that will come to you wearing a brown a suit and she'll be packing little baby in a blanket and from that time on you'll have strength to endure stronger well I told you all that and in Chicago it happened that night with a little Presbyterian lady went her own Pastor centered out with a baby I believe it was his brother or one of them was a doctor he said there's not a hope for the baby unless almighty God touches and he went she went and told her pastor her Pastor said I am I I'm not uh qualified he said to to act upon this Divine Healing because I I don't just don't have it within me the faith that it takes to do it now that's awesome he said I don't I just have it in me he said but I was at one of Brothers meeting and I advise you to take the baby to brother Brandon and the doctor give it up it was going to die and the little lady walked in there where I was having a some sort of a service for them little catholic children that got burnt up in that school up there you know you remember when it was was that in that service and coming right down the platform comes that little lady with the brown suit on my wife and M was sitting there and I said turn and look look all around theater stand there and happen to be that just before come up I'll be Billy Paul and them have been talking to her wife or some of them to the lady with the little baby and the lady walked up to the platform the Holy Spirit revealed the whole thing and heal the baby to death of Walter he said saying I just don't get power see it don't bother me I just go right on and on now I'm looking for something to happen to start that third pull in the March and uh May the next Sunday morning healing service maybe produce that I don't know amen I think for eign [Music] service we got we got sick people get your sick people get them here early next Sunday morning say about eight or eight thirty and uh we'll give them a prayer card as they come in the door however they do it and then we'll have a prayer line and pray for the sick and you see what the holy spirit will do I believe he'll do wonders if we'll just believe it amen but we got to believe him for that now with all of our hearts and I think that the great power has arrived that when God in so much as we're speaking this morning has showed us so much and brought us to a certain just after a spot just to push over that little Hill and that's all you need and then away it goes uh are going just like it was the same thing with the discernment same thing by the father to watch I stand in Calgary I beg your pardon uh it was the Queen City down in retirement Regina and Aaron Baxter was standing there and a bunch of us and the told me right through the platform that'll come to fashion and all the very secret of their heart and that's right not every thought of that in that manner I walked up the platform that night with her and it started praying for the sick and here come a man along you just laid out his entire life first time it ever happened just like that in a moment in a healing Circle and then I looked out all the audience and hear it began to come down over the orange and they or when we reached the other side the half has never yet been told other things to watch out and see things in people's lives I don't say anything about it just let it alone see unless I'm really compelled to say and I look for this next to start like that see God in his own way his own Sovereign time to begin and it'll it'll be a another thing that'll be to be a Way Beyond any of these other things and I'm I'm looking for that to happen and maybe I thought if I'd had a little healing service maybe next Sunday and then the following Sunday I'll probably be away with the kids and them because they got to go back and go to school and then the next Sunday of course I'm up in Chicago at the meeting up there and then come back the following Monday to leave on Tuesday for for Arizona for the kids yeah thank you yeah well what'd you find pastor well I've discovered something very strong good that's very fine now we want to hear about it so now the Lord bless you all real real good and uh hope to see you here next Sunday and Wednesday night and listen don't forget these little churches like brother rattle brother Jackson brother pornell and all those little Brethren who are struggling hard amen and they feel like that we are their their their sister church here you see we're kind of like a little Mother's group to them that's where they were born out of here pastors and so forth this little follow-up back here brother I made the other night over there Allen brother Hannah I hope brother Collins here would get him with brother Allen if he doesn't know him they're both Methodist ministers and has seen a truth of word which the the ark organization of the Methodist Church which is a fine bunch of people in that Methodist Church but you never think they're not they are there's a fine bunch of people at Catholic Church to find a bunch of the Presbyterian churches and all those places that it's man and women that are waiting to see that light flash over their path and just keep flashing a light in humility Sweden that's all grew closer to God by humbling ourselves yes help us don't forget this Tabernacle will lose extreme remember that this is a target where Satan's got every gun in Hell trained on you'll cause one person to do something it's contrary want the other things he's doing that he's up to it that's his business if he can get somebody to say something somebody to talk about another say well listen did you know so-and-so did don't you listen to don't you listen to it all that's the devil see it's Satan don't you believe it if there's anything that somebody's done wrong pray for them don't play in a selfish ways happen I wish my duty Allah God pray to my brother you take it to your heart really down but that's the sister and this tall and be real sweet and the first thing you know you find him right back in the surface against you cause after all we're headed towards the setting others the Lord Jesus will be coming one of these days and you all you know I think it'll be so sad and so so sweet so uh there'll be 100 100 the 100 percent of the whole world will never know when that Badger takes place quietly that nobody no other than that Jesus and there'll be of course the little groups will say voila so and so all they say is fanatic bunch of us that a group left from over there and that's not so they just gone out somewhere we've had that fanatic doesn't see um well they say that little Tabernacle in a place called Jeffersonville there was so many of them members that's missing see they just play that out there say oh there's nothing to that you see I guess it'll be passed and they won't know it Across the Nation will come those who are dead in Christ will rise first the ranch will take place the church will be taken home and then the tribulation will set in and hold my we don't want to be here during that time I don't want to be here in the triple no God forbid that any of us should ever be here during that time because he that's filthy is filthy still he that's holy is Holyfield you that's righteous is righteous still there's no the lamb has come forth with his book of redemption and the bride has been taken out those who turned it down has to go through a tribulation period both Jew and Gentile what a time of tribulation I don't want that Lord sanctify me now that's good Nazarene Doctrine amen and it's truth too yes truth that's right amen fill me now with your Holy Spirit Lord take all the world out of me now Lord It's The Old color brother said sir I got my ticket in my hand it's already punched and when I come down the river that morning I don't want no trouble so that's about right I I don't want no trouble hold your ticket in your hands when the boss we're going over just think of it the great time of redemption is and now another thing brother uh what's his name up here at Utica I think brother Graham yeah and another brother that is pastoring there brother or Shanks or something like that or Saints verse telling to pastor and all together brother Snelling to pass throughout this Utica now I think their prayer media is on Thursday night now you know it would be a real night if we would slip up theirs on Thursday night and show those fellas a little Fellowship see [Music] don't stop just like when Elijah told him said dig ditches out there if you get down you hit an old tin can say I'm too tired throw it away if you if you expect to miss the tribulation you better start digging now for myself I'm preaching to myself there I'm going to start digging deeper than I ever know uh for because I feel like that in the nation and around the world that this ministry will again as it's known Now by everywhere over the world wife said to me every morning I said will she go with me when I leave I'm gonna leave around January the Lord willing I want to take a complete world too all the way around and I come back and May have services in the United States sometime next summer and she said I'm too old to go well I said I went when I about my last trip overseas about eight years ago and I feel like I'm in better shape now than it was eight years ago I know more about it now then we got on the subject if the Lord said I'm going to lock you 25 years you're not going to get people you'll be able to go and I'm gonna launch you 25 years on Earth would you take from from birth to 25 or from 25 to 50 50 to 75 or 75 200. now any man that's not at any time on Earth will certainly if you do a most rational thing if you don't spend that time in service of God I don't care what he does Amen if you're going to be a heartbreak for the women so forth you better take that young age that first 25 if you're going to be a partner a mechanic or something you better take the second 25 see but I was thinking about what about me foreign [Music] [Music]
