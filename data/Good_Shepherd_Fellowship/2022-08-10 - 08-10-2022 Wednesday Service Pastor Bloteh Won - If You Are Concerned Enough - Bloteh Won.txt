the believers over in zimbabwe we had a we had a wonderful meetings wonderful tiresome meeting praise the lord one of the pastor told me he says brother we don't use ministers we abuse them so so i got my shared amen praise the lord amen see i just want to tell you now i just want to be very friend with you and we're going to get everything that we can get out of you but it's going to be in the

to us he's been gracious to us and and we thank the lord for giving us this opportunity i'll take a prayer request here from pastor nada over in mauritius he's asking prayer for one of his deacons nadine and he's been a long-standing brother with our dear brother there in mauritius in a couple of years a few years ago he had to do surgery on some of his volatile organs and now he's down with cancer in the body so [Music] we want to lift our brother up in the hands of the lord [Music] and [Music] since the beginning of this week or late last week there's a sister in uh pastor mark walls church some of you might have picked up that prayer need through facebook or whatsapp their sister solace there's brother marcus wife and she needs a touch from the lord we believe that the lord is moving on behalf of the saints justice gone weekend she's been on a life support and the doctors thought they were not getting no communication from her brain and they were planning on making a move of taking her off of life support but [Music] she's beginning to respond because the saints being praying so we want to lift our sister up in the hands of the lord and [Music] i left zimbabwe and i was transiting over in amsterdam and i got a call from brother frederick that used to be with us young brother frederick he was dealing with a problem from the heart and his younger brother called me from drc he's back in the congo and he's standing right between life and death and he's back in the hospital his uh his heart situation has gone to about from what the younger brother told me down to about 15 percent and i think that is beginning to affect affects his reasoning soul he's in and out of the way that he's communicating so we want to bring brother frederick before the law tonight and wesley and sister character asking prayer for the adult of sarah and the little baby ezra and sarah hussman as well i think the family have been affected with the the kovi virus most especially for the little baby but uh i think uh they are doing uh better is not in uh in a kind of a critical state but in the prayer and i think also uh there was a prayer request that came true for uh we want a sister father friend a work-made mother also i didn't see the the request but i saw some messages through so talking to my wife she related it to me a little bit and so we have all of these knees tonight and most especially when with this life threatening situation [Music] we know that the devil will try to [Music] make use of whatever opportunity that he has to frustrate our faith and to put us more in the kind of a doubtful position worry position than believing on the almighty god amen sometimes you hear these things and you know it's so easy for us to fall into that move oh my god oh god have mercy instead of us jumping to the position of faith and say god is more than able to bring that person out we because we are serving the living god praise the lord amen we are serving the living god i mean this gone weekend i saw god moving in a way that i've never seen him move for a long time now praise the lord amen and and to just see how the the saints were was sprinking out to to

voices together remembering brother nadine over in mauritius and sister solage over there in the in the dc area brother frederick they're in drc congo there is no distance with god especially when we

michigan young people banquet that you had a blast and that's good amen you had a blast and god you never exploded amen and you had a blast and that's that's wonderful praise the lord and so we just thank the lord we thank the lord for granting us a safe travel this was a kind of uh kind of a reconnecting uh trip that we had to make something that just that just came up came up when we were over in the uk uh uh had us have had a service for brother joe chicosy her old friend and then so he kind of prayed on me to to come and be with them yeah they are building their church so they thought they would have got the church ready for dedication so he wanted me to come for the dedication so he said well if it does not work we still want you to come and uh because since since uh the lockdown uh kovi locked down this will be the first time that the the saints in zimbabwe are having big meetings congregating together you get in the country to stay you know they stay uh uh uh very serious on using their marks and different things so uh so you could see that uh they really needed this time to together so it was it was something they were doing for the local church and and the churches that spring out of the local church there in harare but then it turned out to be something completely different praise the lord a meeting that was not announced three thousand people show up so if it was announced maybe we have been buried with the crowd praise the lord so uh the first night uh the they have it they had a tent that it put up uh that they have they normally run their meetings to about five thousand plus but because the meeting was not announced so they just used half of the tent that could hold about two thousand two thousand five but it i mean the people overran the tent so uh it was it was just uh extraordinary to see the people turning out for the meetings in that number and not only just the turnout but to see the reception man just to see the reception uh the way the people receive the word i mean uh it's almost looks like when you are preaching you want to take the words from your mouth amen you know i mean brothers sisters they all run into the pulpit and and it was just it was just something completely different and i have a uh i'm not i'm not very too smart you know when uh when when serious things are going on to be able to video it uh it already happened before i realized oh my god i wanna i wish i video it you know so i'm not very smart in that so i told some of the brothers to send me some of the videos that they talked during the meetings so i don't have enough videos to sh to share with you but uh i thought i would i would just show you a few of them and so i told expert jordan to help us just to be able to throw a few of the videos up and [Music] this was uh one of the worship service after the preaching i think yeah this was after the preaching there should be monday we had a we had a saturday morning saturday evening sunday morning sunday evening monday morning monday evening because this time of the year uh is the memorial what what we would call memorial day is the memorial day they call it the heroes day and then then tuesday also follow as the armed force is there so it's a long weekend so uh and the amazing thing there is that this is not the only meetings that is going on you have three thousand people here and then you have brother gideon on the other side have five thousand people also gathered you know and then uh over in montari you have another group of thousands of people i don't know how to do it but that's that's uh that's what they are doing today praise the lord and now while we were going to one of the meetings i i you know i could see the other group going on the other side so the brothers stop and say well you see that building there five thousand people are gathering there for meetings [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] if i took them they would not be good so [Applause] [Music] ah let's see [Music] now the brother that is the brother that is that is leading the song here he's uh he's uh he's the associate pastor to brother chico cd in uh in harare one of the things that blew my mind was to see how how humble the people are okay it's not only for them you know worshipping like this but some of these men are top men in the zimbabwe society the brother that is leading the song on the ground there he's one of the chief justice this brother he's a very top man in the zimbabwe government and to see how the world would put such a humbleness in their heart i mean it would make you a shame of yourself because those are not people that you can come close to in the society but if they don't tell you you will not know and uh uh brother that was one of the reason why i asked i asked the pastor to send me this particular video i just wanted to to have that and uh uh not only this brother there's another brother there where is he i think he's standing on this side because i was somewhere on this side after the meeting i came down from the pulpit he's he's also one of the chief executive in one of the biggest zimbabwe bank and he's a pastor of another assembly but our brother uh but joe told me he says he says brother one he says all of these brothers they started with us you know they started with us it's not that they have got to this level before they started believing god the reason why they can be humble the way they are because they got god before they got to this position [Music] [Applause] [Music] before they got to those positions in life and and sometimes it is it is i'm trying to look for the best way to to be able to say so i will now offend you i was trying to look for the best polite way to say so i will now offend ourselves but you realize that jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and then all other things will be added to you praise the lord amen and i mean they are they are great blessings in serving the lord if you want to watch the dance we can send it to you later also you can watch it but that was some of the reason why i wanted to grab that those ones with the sisters coming up i took those ones actually because i was i was i was seeing that other sister with the baby on the back she couldn't hold back she wanted to get into the dance i said well this one i have to i have to take it myself praise the lord but i mean it was just tremendous it was tremendous and and i mean there were there were there were just thousands of uh i mean i mean just just blessing the last service for almost 30 minutes i couldn't say a word because the presence was just all over the place you i just you just can't say a word i mean the people are worshiping they are streaming they are the uh you know someone breaking in the back in tongues and i mean it was just all over the place and you can just see the uh you know it's it's not the preacher that brings that to the people it's what the people have it's the expectation that they have for god so i don't think we brought anything special to zimbabwe i think i left from there being more blessed then then you know even though you know all the way around the people said they were blessed but i think i was more blessed i think i was more blessed uh but this this really got to me you know it got to me just to see the humbleness among the brothers and many of these people been preaching the gospel long time before us and but they love the lord there they love the word you know and uh and the lawyer brother he says something to me and he says he said brother juan you know when you were preaching we were we were listening to you carefully you know when when pastor chicos he was preaching we were all jumping excited because we know him you we don't know you so we were trying to list him very close i told him i said well that's okay but uh there's uh we can okay i send a picture up except there's a picture that i send side we will see jesus if you can pull that up that was the highlight of my trip this is in the united pentecostal church in the united pentecostal church where brother chicos is now using for his service that's why he's having services in in harare uh while they are building their church so when they moved here and started having service they've been here for for many years now as they are working on their building [Music] then he said he came across the inscription on the puppet and wanted to find out who put it in because this is in the united pentecostal church and so he found out that this was a pentecostal missionary from the united states that built that church and he put this inscription on the puppet and then after following uh you know trying to get in contact and ignoring the history of uh of the minister that did that he came to realize there was somebody that was acquainted with brother branham all ministry good that was that was that was the quantity with brother brandon ministry so uh uh uh yeah i think that was the very first day when he picked me up from uh from the airport we went to see the putting up of the tent and then he wanted to show me where they were having service and then we were walking around he said come let's let me show you something you know and then he says uh you know we we uh the place they were using you know had her problem and he says i went before the lord fasting and praying and the lord led me here and then i came in and i formed favor with the people they gave us this building because uh the church uh is decreasing in size why because the the the pastor that was there started uh allowing things contrary to the scripture and uh uh walliness and uh you know uh the dress code and all of that so the the missionary brother that built the church decided not to work with him so then he took a group a big group of the people and then so there is an old uh minister brother that stayed there so he have a small group of people there so brother joseph and his church are renting the building and they are using the rent to take care of their pentecostal pastor so they have they have the building to themselves they use it uh sunday for their services uh monday they have a uh their prayer meeting and then wednesday friday and the rest of it that they use so they they're using that building so he said when i came and then i saw this i knew exactly that uh that it was the law's leading you know that it was the law's leading that the law would lead me right to this place and to come and see an inscription so we will see jesus so i said to myself i'm going to take a picture of this and i'm going to to do this inscription i hope i can do the same and put it on the pulpit because i think that's what we come to church for we come to see jesus not to see a man amen praise the lord we will see jesus that was the highlight that was the first day and my trip was already filled with wonderful things praise the lord then i started on my way back i was listening to the message side we will see jesus the first uh series that brandon preached and then i started looking through through the because that was a campaign message uh i thought that uh that was the most preach sermon in the campaign but no jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever was the most preached that brother brandon preached in the campaign and then next to that was uh i think the year jehim series and the inside we will see jesus was the third most message that he preached in the campaign series so uh all of those things was was what i was having fun with on my way back i mean sleeping and if i can't sleep then i start having fun looking into those things so i would have i was going to talk i was actually thinking to take up side we will see jesus that's what i thought i was going to speak on tonight just for an hesitation for this prayer meeting i had on my heart that we were going to take these knees in prayer after i got the call from frederick brother and then all through uh uh us being away the text message kept coming for our dear sister uh uh over there in the dc area and i just felt like okay when i get back we will just have a little time of praying and let's let's take these knees to heart and take them to our prayer chamber amen and remember and remember those needs that the law would be able to to meet those ones but then as i was as i was studying in reading listening to different things then something else came to my mind that i would like to share with you uh tonight so uh as we will trust the lord to be our help and uh this is it for the five so uh if i should finish by nine o'clock then i have 15 minutes to talk to you so let's just stand on our feet and see how the lord will be able to help us tonight praise the lord uh i thought to to just use uh this uh evening for a little bit of this report because sunday i would like to go into something very serious and just address some few things and then we can get back to our normal life amen praise the lord glory be to god hallelujah there is something that caught my mind and uh there is something that caught my my attention and that's what i wanted to share with you actually is uh something that uh that the prophet of god spoke about praise the lord let's go in the book of joshua joshua chapter 6. praise the lord now because of time we will not be able to read the entire chapter let's read verse 25 and 26 and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her father's household and all that she had and she'd worked in israel even on to this day because she had the messengers which joshua sent to spy algerico and joshua enjoyed him at that time saying curse be the man before the lord i want you to listen to these words very carefully curse be the man before the lord that rises up and built this city jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first bone and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of egg so the lord was with joshua and his friend was noise throughout all the country let us pray father this inspiration just got on my heart lord father sometime today but lord i pray that god you will bless it tonight in and just bless your people father thank you lord god for the deacons and the trustees the officers who god father the brothers and sisters lord god that [Music] identified with this local assembly and that i always lord god believe in your heart lord jesus that you are you are doing something here lord and they identify with it father even lord if they are present or absent lord but your heart is in whatever you are doing here so lord we just want to thank you we want to thank you father lord because unless you give us a revelation to be able to understand and rightly identify with what you are doing we will be tossed about with every wings of doctrine will be tossed about with every man that comes and and preach something lord god and and sometimes so godfather will be so disturbing our mind lord and uh but we just want to thank you that you have raised up a people that love you and and and they are ready to to support what your grace is doing here we are very grateful father we ask that you bless us now and you bless our invisible audience too that are streaming in and we just ask that father god may faith oh god father be raised tonight lord where we can be fully identified with you in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you so for the next 15 minutes i want us to you may have your seat i want to just uh take uh uh look in today's sin and uh and and trust that the lord will be able to bless us praise the lord amen you know the word has been so amazing to me i heard bert branham saying something and let me let me see if i can find it it's not part of my notes it just it just came to my mind right now so uh they won't have it back there but uh i was i was preaching there in zimbabwe and i was preaching on uh a message i believe i appreciate before uh if not then we will appreciate here but uh i was actually talking on uh junction of time if you if you go back and read the jeffersonville series that was the first time brother branham preached it and he preaches somewhere else but completely different than when he preached it in in in and then he said in that message how the lord gave him a message for the church and what he said was that the church was standing the threshold of the greatest vindication of the unimportance praise the lord what a threshold is a threshold is is a doorway either a doorway a gateway or a passage you know you know a threshold so he said the church was standing on the threshold where the church was going to experience the vindication of the greatest only proteins and then i i took a talk and i was i was sharing with the with the with the believers i don't want to go into there let me let me read this if if this is not what i'm thinking about then i will i will i will move on he says i believe that god never at any time nothing miraculous or nothing ever taking place unless god falls short about his word revade it place it so that man who failed to walk in it he says who have to stand before him and he will he says they will have to stand without an excuse because god make it so plain that if a man is concerned enough this was what struck me god made his word so plain that if a man is concerned enough about it he will find it if you are concerned praise the lord this word is so rich i mean there are just so many things here you know he says that if a man is concerned enough about it he will find it praise the lord sometimes it it seems to be like uh you know uh uh to others that you know maybe uh uh we we uh we we uh trying to look for things but you see just like brother branham explained in the opening of the seals he says these seals open just like a rocket he says there was there is one explosion and then uh the the the particles from from that big explosion when and exploded he says and from that explosion they explode and on the other side the one that when they explode and it just went from explosion explosion explosion explosion the rapture would be one explosion that would take us to heaven the burning of this f would be one ex because it's all in the word everything that is fulfilling is just an explosion of god's word praise the lord amen well the reason why uh a akovic kind of for shock us is because it's an explosion a prophet talked about plagues coming upon the earth amen and many of us thought in our mind you know because we are in the message the brow will be gone that's the reason why some people thought we were in the tribulation but it's just an explosion it's it's it's an opening you know what uh the world will open it will open in different dimensions it will open in different way even in our very lives but you see the ones that uh these things are real talk are the ones that are concerned enough there are other people they are not concerned to them they are baptized in jesus name they believe the message so to them is i mean they are bright they are they are in the message but to the ones that are concerned enough you can go from one explosion to another explosion because the word keeps opening the word keeps unveiling the word keep loosening is just the same word it's the same word it's the same word it's just use of words revealing loosening opening exploring is the same word praise the lord so he says to the ones that are concerned enough about it he will found it right if you are concerned praise the lord amen and like i've always said to you when you read the word whether is a scripture or the message of the hour and something stand out to you it's an opportunity that the holy spirit is giving you amen now when you understand it when you don't understand it [Music] when it stands out to you and you don't understand it god is giving you an opportunity to show you something but the problem there is like brother branham said in christ is the mystery of god reveal we are too lazy and we allow petty things to take us away from that glorious experience praise the lord so let's look into what we want to share share with you tonight uh i hope i hope i will not get on the rabbit tray with this amen because when i start these kind of things it's how this is not this is not pretty much very it's not very organized now brother branham will will will take we'll take this okay we we we read this we read joshua promise let's look also in the book of kings let's look at the fulfillment what is the fulfillment but let's look at uh first king chapter 16. now remember now joshua brought rahab out of the land of jericho and by the marching around jericho the walls of the city fell praise the lord amen it was not imaginary wars the walls actually fell down praise the lord amen the walls actually fell down just like brother branham talked about the coming down of the berlin wall you saw it in the vision he said it and it did happen amen so yeah joshua now he cursed the city and i love what he said as we just read it in the scripture curse be the man before the lord because that is very prophetic that just that just kind of forgot my mind today i was i was just i was just somewhere else completely first king chapter 16 verse 34 follow me in a little bit now let's read the last verse the bible says that in verse 33 first kings 16 33 and ahab made a growth and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him amen he did more why because he got married to idolatry praise the lord the other people practice it but he he went and married the princess of uh of uh uh the adult worshipper uh god or priest jesse bell that's what she was so he actually married uh idolatry which was a very perfect type of uh pagan room the church getting married to pig in rome in his days verse 34 did he help the the belterlites which is a man of belter built jericho he led the foundation thereof in ibiram his firstborn praise the lord and he set up the gates thereof in his youngest son shiego whatever the right pronunciation is according to the word of the lord which he speak by joshua the son of gnome the interesting part of this whole thing is that joshua gave a prophecy praise the lord and right in the time of ahab just before uh uh the prophet elijah will step on the scene because the next chapter one will talk about elijah the tishma just before the prophet elijah would step on the scene god in his design his intelligence to god the details does not matter praise the lord because this man that uh that that that built this city in the blood of his firstborn there was a day that he was born he got a birthday just like you get birthday you like your birthday the scripture did not recorded his birthday he might have gone to school the scripture did not record it he got married before he had the children the scripture did not recall it just in one verse praise the lord and that will be the only verse in the bible that will deal with that prophecy now what i'm trying to bring to your mind is to help us to realize how much it was important to almighty god to make sure that the word that his seven joshua the prophet spoke have to come to pass praise the lord amen and in the in the in in in in in the right description the bible just like joshua the prophet said he laid the foundation in a beer of his firstborn and he raised the gifts of the city in the blood of his younger son just exactly like the prophet joshua said the word of god never fails amen praise the lord now but when joshua prophesied he said curse be the man before the lord praise the lord cursed be the man before the lord hallelujah amen now but then if you follow the scripture you follow you follow the scripture you will see that there is there's something i want to i want to get to your mind yet i hope uh i didn't i didn't look over it now yeah in the message in the message bla botimus bert branham will talk about the city of jericho and there's a way that the prophet we'll talk about it but i want you to follow me a little bit because you're going to see some contracts here he says but this this poor blind man sitting outside the the big weakest city always was a weaker city talking about jericho now jericho was always a weakest city now brother branham will talk just because of time you can go and look through it he would talk here describing jericho as a weakest city he goes back to the story of of uh uh the book of joshua and and and and and you know and and show how it was the curse of joshua make the city became a continuous wicked city he would take the story of the good samaritan to show that when jesus talked about the good samaritan he he talked about a man coming from uh uh a jericho amen the good samaritan he was he was hijacked by the people that beat him all that beat the man because it was a good samaritan to help right let me get my story right now oh yes i have to go back to sunday school it was a good samaritan i had the man that was that was that was rob praise the lord so he was talking he he talks about how the man came from a backsliding state because jericho was a backsliding city praise the lord are we together [Music] but you see oh my goodness are we together amen let me read this uh uh divine healing 1954 sitting there in that condition and after a while i imagine he he began let's let's imagine he's thinking now he's talking again about the condition of lamborghini sitting right in the corner at the gate of jericho now this was the very same gate that this man had to raise in the blood of his youngest son praise the lord amen but what what is hating that we don't see is what i pray that holy spirit will be able to show us glory be to god sitting there let's imagine he's thinking in his mind he's talking about blah blah timbers maybe he reached out his hand across the curb and he and and he rubbed the stones on the street think many years ago blah blah team was thinking now many years ago joshua the great conqueror in god's army led the children of israel right up that same road amen not only that but right not very far from that same gate joshua was wandering around one day and he met a man who drew the sword praise the lord now so what i want you to realize is that that place was not always a cursed place praise the lord amen we know that uh uh uh uh god sent a joshua and his men this was the possession of the of of of the promised land god was giving his people the promised land and then and uh uh rehab came out of the land and here is joshua he sees he's he sees uh he's cursing the land and cursed be the man that will that will that would build this city he will have to do it in the blood of his first son and his youngest son if you don't see alpha and omega in there just wait a while you will see it and and joshua he says the the the the conqueror in god's army led the churn of israel right up that roar not only that but right not very far from that same gate joshua was wandering around and he and he met a man who drew the sword and claimed to be the captain of the host of the lord jesus christ himself standing there in person just outside of the gate over that same road 800 years before come elijah any larger on that role to jobbing and elijah was going to be taken up now you have to realize that in the taking off of elijah jericho was mentioned [Music] praise the lord jericho was mentioned and elijah on the road to jericholan uh uh and elijah was going to be taken up in a in a real winning and he last shot a double portion of the spirit on that same road on the jericho road there's a song called on the jericho road praise the lord i couldn't get my internet on the flower as we'll be singing it tonight you know me last night it comes to my mind i send you up straight he says but they're all the poor old blind beggar the priest had told him listen now the priest had told him the clergy of the day then things are passed away see the comparison he's making the priests misinterpreting the word and giving blame but timos a wrong understanding of what god have done praise the lord let me take it for example making blah blah blah this place was cursed joshua our great army cursed this place no wonder you are just a beggar you might you might remain a beggar and die a beggar because you are standing in a cursed place praise the lord amen and and and and the clergy of that day cease is like that and i'm without doubt that many of the clergy today sees it the same praise the lord because until god opened your eyes i've always seen jericho that way as a cursed city but that was just before the coming of the prophet elijah just before a mighty prophet would step on the scene god raised up a man to be able to redeem that city he had to build a city in the blood of his firstborn praise the lord go back to the scripture for time's sake we will not read all about it but what is the name of the man is spell h i e l what does he names means what does he means means oh my goodness praise the lord what is the meaning of his name brother branham tells us about how the bible is written between the lines and sometimes god will just put just one word and nothing more there is another scripture in the book of judges i could show you tonight time will not allow us just one friend he was a judge in israel but the bible only just said one just one verse about nothing more about him and sometimes you having internal glory package just in that one verse praise the lord the meaning of this man name means you have to realize now the prophet of god taught us what el means every time you see el in a word l it means god praise the lord it means god for god so love the word amen praise the lord that he will redeem the earth in the blood of his own begotten son means the life of god god lives that's right praise the lord if you are concerned enough that's why the prophet that's why my prophet told me that if i'm concerned enough if jericho was just such a cursed place why would god recall it in a larger rapturing message what a beautiful story of blind by timos do you realize that that jesus visited uh zacchaeus in jericho and he said salvation has come to your house praise the lord what did what did uh uh uh joshua said what what did he say curse be the man before the lord so the man that was going to do this was honor prophecy he was on a divine prophecy just like abraham sacrificing his own son just like japan sacrificing his own beloved daughter for the redemption of israel there will be a man that will raise up a city that was cursed amen in the blood of his only son praise the lord brother branham says how those old testament characters never even knew that god was writing divine scripture in their lives praise the lord was he the king of jericho was he the king why should he sacrifice his own son to redeem that city why but he was on the prophecy [Music] he was on a divine prophecy because on that same jericho road the son of god was going to walk one day on that same jericho road a prophet amen elijah was going to use that road so there had to be a man that would rise up on the same to take the curse away glory be to god amen if jericho was so cursed jesus would not meet zacchaeus and jericho oh my praise the lord hallelujah amen brother branham said he says here god provide a way he says he says this is the time to shout he says the walls of jericho as it was the enemy that's keeping you out praise the lord will fall to the ground now see the type that he's bringing amen see the type that brother branham is comparing jericho with praise the lord amen he said even the way that god designed the city he said jerusalem is up on the hill and jericho is down in the valley geographically god just display it like that it was not only because of the physical lane when jesus talked about the story of the about a good samaritan he was talking about our our state our backslidden state we are born in this curse our first birth water it was in the the the the good way hospital or it was in male hospital whatever it was we were born under this curse praise the lord and on our first birth we were rap just like that man from jericho but we were on our way to jerusalem up the hill praise the lord jerusalem was our destiny and god had to send a good samaritan this message of the hour is our good samaritan that took us in our state and put us in the key of the holy ghost why because god lives and because he led i can face tomorrow because he live i can face tomorrow oh my goodness this kind of a thing can just make me crazy because i'm telling you i'm enjoying it more than i'm preaching it [Music] so i don't care whether you enjoy it or not it's making more sense to me praise the lord you think about it jericho was part of the land that joshua was supposed to possess it was part of their inheritance you think about it it was all part of their inheritance glory be to god it just shows how almighty god in the blood of his first only begotten son was going to take the curse that we were born in praise the lord amen hallelujah he says let the audience testimony let the audience give a shout like they did at the gates of jericho and the walls will fall down let the cripples stand up let the blind people stand to their feet all the sickness and afflicted be healed all the sick and the afflicted be healed praise the lord amen then i read one more and then we close here for this wednesday night bert brown is going to talk about a story that happened in jonesborough arkansas he says in arkansas they have what they call the jim crow lord he says the color red and the white can be together he says i'm from the south but i don't think that's right he says i look over there and there's two a poor old colored man standing their edge a little rain and white head in his head he says he had a cop on his head his wife was standing by him and he had in his hands he had his hands up blind as he could be saying mercy mercy and i was reading this story tonight i was just thinking about blind by timor's our blind by timos this was our jericho road so just think about jericho road now praise the lord saying mercy mercy and tears streaming down his cheek brother branham says i taught off all blind by fame was standing at the gate of jericho look around started moving on the holy spirit said go over there where he's at i turned aside they said don't go over there now it was the lord okay brother brown being being a white man he was not supposed to go over to word the colored people were he said they said don't go over there brother brethren i said but the holy spirit tells me go over there the holy ghost break every curse [Laughter] [Music] glory be to god amen hallelujah oh i just love the lord this way amen but the holy ghost tell me to go over there and i went over there and they drew a rink just imagine trying to protect him from getting over to the people i never will forget what his wife said she said the possum man coming to you honey i walk on over to where he's at his old feeble hands dropped said is this you pastor branham i said yes sir he fell my face he put his hand in and failed my face he said oh you are a young man i said no sir not too young say i'm trying to say yes oh and he feed around my face like that said pastor branham do you got a meaning to listen to me and i said yes sir he said my old mommy had legends it's talking about you know religion like you got said she never told me a lie all her life said pastor branham she's been there now many years said i've been blind and drawing the blind pension for about 10 years say i live about 200 miles from here i never heard of you in my life but said this morning about three o'clock say i woke up in my room and of course i can't see but saying look like standing before me still my oh mama i said mama is that you she said yes honey she said i mean i'm just i'm just feeling the back of my head just getting big on my shoulder amen glory be to god we are on our jericho road now we're close with this and then if the lord want us to pick it up we'll pick it up some another time amen she said you go down there to calm down accuse rise and put on your clothes and ask for somebody by the name of branham that's praying for the sake you shall receive your sight said pastor branham i put on my clothes and yeah amen amen can you help me oh i owe mine i taught god you were witness that these stones would cry out something has to say i just put my hands over his eyes and i said father i do not understand i said you sent the brother here i asked for his sight and i took my hands down seeing him smiling wiping his eyes looking around and kind of smiled said i can see honey she said you see honey said show see them people there that red car sitting behind she fell down on her knees and strained to the top of her voice praise the lord amen now what i want to grab your attention in tonight praise the lord amen you see the scripture is god's word the scripture is not english it's not french it's not chinese not spanish whichever language you are perfect in the english is the word of god and lying on those pages there are millions of words and range that you can break into yeah and they can change your life praise the lord little joshua kneel that he was prophesying i mean i was just reading a lot of quotes today i didn't have time to put every one of them together because i knew that i mean i will run out of time tonight if i want to show you video and all of that but it just cut my heart you know after seeing how the word there with me this weekend it just caught my heart to kind of look at that entire picture a different way sure praise the lord amen because we realize that after after the scripture you even go and read the book of ezra you will see when ezra the rebuilding of the city and and the different tribes and the different people that were giving back to their city jericho was also jericho was given to the people that it belongs to it was counted now so if if if you only take the tot of jericho being a cursed city you will miss the complete picture because the emphasis the emphasis under that prophecy is cursed be the man before the lord praise the lord amen which sounds to me that god was going to use a man to wipe away the curse from upon the city god was going to use a man that was that that was that was going to use the blood of his firstborn whatever it takes to be able to redeem this city back because it was an inheritance for israel if ezra divided it to the people it was an inheritance that people god was going to use a man to redeem the city back and if he was going to take the life of his firstborn right just to be able to bring the glory of jericho back praise the lord hallelujah knowing that a prophet elijah was going to come and that was going to be his path to the rapture knowing that our lord jesus was going to come and he was going to meet a blind man right on that very same jericho road praise the lord do you know when brother brahm talks about the samaritan woman when he said that jesus passed the jericho wrote to go over to samira so what what do jericho represent for the believers praise the lord just like all the land in canada did represent there were land that were possessed by the inhabitants of the land and just like how this this our body was possessed by our affluent nature it was possessed by all the genes that came from our grandparents and great-grandparents that's all we deal with in this body praise the lord but a man has to give the life of his owner's first son praise the lord it was the life of his firstborn and it became also the life of the youngest one because the embarrassing life that was giving came back on the days of pentecost to do it among the believers that's the thing that redeemed our land that's the thing that makes us any better before god it's not what we do is what god has given he gave his own life on the cross of calvary it was not enough he sent the spirit that was in that life back on the church [Music] praise the lord amen that man was god himself the story of redemption is all over the bible it's all over the bible it does not give you any chance for you to rely on your merit it doesn't give you it does not make any provision for you to trust in your strength or trust in your self-righteousness because redemption is all over the bible praise the lord amen amen now god can get healing out of jericho road on jericho road he can say salvation has come to your house zacchaeus he can use jericho road and go and find a woman that was captured in prostitution because one man was under prophecy one man can you imagine that man so being so he been so taken to heart for the satan of jericho that he would take his firstborn i don't believe that i mean he he sacrificed his son but whatever that he had to do to get back that city it would cause the life of his firstborn praise the lord and then when he goes back to building the walls or putting up the gates maybe his little young son tried to help [Music] and the gate fell on his shoulder and he also died why because a prophet said it right and it was going to be a new testament type for you and myself let's stand on our feet tonight if you are concerned enough god we're open to your understanding more than what is written in the letters praise the lord do you know how much those clergy and priests who have discouraged blam batimus didn't you read in a scripture that this place is a cursed land oh you come to this kid of jericho whole day no wonder why your life can never be better but there was something in his heart like brother branham said he remember it was on that same jericho road that joshua made the angel of the lord when the angel drew his sword he said he remember it was at that very same gate of jericho so the prophet of god says misinterpretation of the word has handled the church has limited the church from their blessing we have created so much fear in the people that they cannot reach out to god they cannot be able to reach out and step out of their situation god has made provision all over the scriptures for us not to live on our cursed life [Music] praise the lord because that's what the holy ghost comes to deal with the holy ghost comes to deal with the curse of sin when the holy ghost comes in the believer it deals with the curse that's why we still get sick even though we get the holy ghost we still get sick why because the curse is dealt with and because the curse is there with the desire to do wrong the desire to live in sin is not there it does not mean that we are not tempted it does not means that they are not things that we are dealing with but the holy ghost comes it burn out the curse [Music] but you see when when the word is not rightly taught it puts you in a place when you are dealing with these things it makes you to feel like oh i don't have the holy ghost because if i had the holy ghost i would not be in this situation no the whole wash your motive and your objective what's your desire what are the things that you are desiring if your desire is fulfilled if your desire is for those things that are wrong then you need the holy ghost because that curse has not been destroyed but if your desire is for more of god but your mind is battle praise the lord oh just hold on to that desire because when the deep corners unto the deep there is a deep to respond if there is a desire more of god there is a god to feel that desire [Music] i am [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] forever [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the lord let you speak to the lord tonight hallelujah god has made provision all all in this world i don't know what you are dealing with that the blood is not enough to settle i don't know what you're dealing with in your life i don't know what the devil is using to condemn you that the blood is not enough to settle when jesus said on the cross that it is finished they wrap up all the old testament types everything that represents a redemption in the old testament was wrapped up in that statement problem said we are limiting god by our faith we need to be stretching out into the promised world we need to be seen more than what the letters is written looking behind the prince looking and seeing what god has heard in his word heavenly father almighty god thank you for the wednesday night lord we can be back lord jesus and tamil father lord in fellowship with your children oh god we just want to bless your name father lord father god lord jesus like your prophet said lord in the message future home just like how you deal with the earth that's the way you deal with the bride lord you deal with your people precious law we see a representation of god father in jericho but lord god more than lord father god lord it was just a shout of your people that brought the walls of jericho down and oh god if we can get into the shout the shout at the message of the hour lord it's not our noise it's not our emotion but if we can get in the message of the our father and we can be able to see the promises law and will bring all the jericho walls down upon us oh god father lord i pray tonight o lord jesus oh father is to be able to place your people right in the promised law and help them with god the law to be able to claim the blessings to be able father to rightly identify themselves with god oh jesus you are the same yesterday today and forever your blessings are all over the world of father lord god we can come to your

may we be able to just take up all our condemned mind our skepticism lord god and be able to see lord what is the blessing that is hidden in this scripture what is behind the prank because when we look father we are surely glory to see you i pray that you bless your children tonight father we love you we appreciate you we pray for the service on sunday that god you were coming me to admit with us here father we love you we thank you father in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray with faith and thanksgiving in jesus name amen amen praise the lord hallelujah sorry for keeping you late

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
