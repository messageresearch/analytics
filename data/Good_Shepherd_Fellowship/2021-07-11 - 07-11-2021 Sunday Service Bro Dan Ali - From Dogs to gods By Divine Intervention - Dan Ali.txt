pray do not leave anyone out be with us father let every i behold you come and present your own word to your people this amount father we ask in the name of jesus and we are so grateful that you've heard and answered our prayer this morning in jesus name amen shall we be seated god bless you musicians that will be all for now so brother one is traveled to illinois he's not in our midst this morning and um he's asked me to convey his greetings to the church he went with brother ariel so they send their greetings keep them in your prayers hopefully they should be leaving back uh they should be coming back tonight yes um amen so we have a prayer request here we shall look at that later we have a few visitors in our midst uh says miracle god bless you for coming amen and we have a family here um brother yourself say here did i pronounce that name right yeah beautiful okay uh sister rebecca say here [Music] a man brother obi daisya sister sarah's here and brother linwell see ya amen so you are all warmly welcome to the house of god there are no visitors in our gates so don't consider yourself a visitor just enjoy the lord praise be to god now brother one had something to read originally before he traveled and um he called this morning and um he asked does print copies of it after church uh brother jordan has printed a lot of copies so there is a copy for everyone but then there is one here he wants us to read and [Music] do you do you fear cancer and i s by miss rosella griffith of juliet illinois and it was on this day july 11th that the prophet of god prayed for this sister and now he wants us to read if i'm going to read this it will take time so i have i have a lawyer behind there brother jordan do you mind coming around praise the lord amen okay all right this is just a testimony and i'll give you a quick background so you know what we're reading of a sister who was diagnosed as an alcoholic that brother branham prayed for and the day she was prayed for was june 11th let me see i know the date is on here 1952 and so brother one thought it would be advantageous to us to go ahead and bring that up kind of as a memorial of what god has done in our time in our age or something that we can relate to that god is still able to do today so there's a little bit of a long reading so um i'll try to read it quickly but not so quick that you can't understand what i'm saying and we'll go through it and then i'll just make a comment or two at the end but i thought that song here that we were singing right here at the end of song service was so applicable that there's a fountain filled with blood and whatever your issue or a trial whatever you're going through sickness whatever your temptation there is a fountain filled with blood that you can plunge beneath this morning that wipes every sin away all right let's go ahead and read it and brother dan already read the title this was a miss rosalia griffith or as we would say a sister rosalia griffith of julia illinois and this is her testimony and it says i'd like to give my testimony here for jesus said where jesus said go and be a witness unto me and we overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony i could not give a testimony like this if i were my in my old self but i'm not in myself i am in christ jesus i am an only child and as long as i can remember i kept looking for something to make me happy i kept seeking something i knew not what i was seeking peace and joy i had to play with the other children in the neighborhood and it seemed i never fit in i was sent as a child to the methodist church in our small town in southern illinois when i was six years old i went with my grandmother to a revival and i went down the sawdust trail to give my heart to jesus but nobody helped me i'm afraid i did not live for him i went to sunday school church and in summer i went to youth camp from our church but through all this i did not know jesus christ as my savior i knew stories about jesus but i did not really know him at this time then we moved to another city and after graduation from high school i started working in an office six and seven days a week three to 11 pm shift so when the girls did have an evening off we would go out together many times we would go into chicago we thought we were having fun we would dance and needless to say we would have a few drinks they could stop when they wanted to stop drinking but i could not for i'd order extra drinks being away ahead of them i was not immoral but god said one sin is as great as another in his eyes i resented the fact that i was compelled to do something beyond my own will in the year ninth of 1949 i knew i was a confirmed alcoholic i did not want to admit it even to myself i was at the bottom of the ladder and seemed like there was no hope for me my parents wanted to help me but they didn't know how to cope with me for neither of them drank in my heart i wanted to be free and i tried everything to get my mind off drinking but it did not take the habit away finally i decided i would try going to alcoholics anonymous thinking they might help me i was really happy in this organization although i stayed sober for nine months through going to their meetings i prayed every day at the bottom of my bed for god to keep me sober he did keep me sober but i was not happy or free before i joined alcoholics anonymous i was in and out of hospitals until they got tired of seeing me come in i went to an alcoholic hospital in chicago where it cost and fifty dollars for five days and my folks there were not wealthy people for with hospitals and doctors bills mounting up at this period in my life i was so weak losing weight and just miserable five doctors had given me up completely one doctor said in six months time i'd be in the mental institution neighbors had given me up ministers didn't know what to do one minister came out and tried to reason with me over the scriptures what i needed was someone who could do like the disciples did command the demon of alcohol to leave in the name of jesus christ my dad told my mother to give up praying for me for i'd never change but she did not listen to him for she said maybe i wouldn't change but she knew god was able to change me mother bought me a fur coat thinking if i fell in the cold i'd not freeze i split the pockets of the coat and put bottles all around in the lining of the coat i'm so glad my mother stood by me and clung to god's word when all said i could not be different even though i disgraced her and she did not understand why i did as i did she still stood with me when i lifted a cup or a glass to drink out of it i shook so i had to lap it up like a little dog i turned catholic looking for peace of mind even though i did not believe in it they told me i needed help but did not forward me to christ all in all everyone but my mother on earth had given me up as hopeless when i was at the worst i ever was my mother saw me in a vision as being saved behind a pulpit unzipping a bible she believed god because god showed her in a vision rather than believe being five earthly doctors later this vision was fulfilled when i was at the worst in the end a doctor waited all night long at the foot of my bed for me to draw my last breath i'm so glad that there was a greater doctor than that doctor standing there knowing i'd not die but live to glorify his name jesus said the thief cometh to seek and devour and destroy but i am come that you may have life and have it more abundantly groping for a ray of light when life was the darkest some people told me of a meeting in hammond indiana where a prophet of god reverend william branham was praying for the sick where the lame walked and the blind he were healed cancers healed miracles were done in the name of christ i clung to these words for i thought if these people could be healed surely then i could be healed too we went to the meeting the third day after i was told about the meeting my mother her friend and i went to the civic center that day on july 11 1952 where the meeting was being held i saw the people singing and praise god i thought they surely were happy i still looked out the corner of my glasses to see how they were acting and thought i'll go along with them if i could find help later i was to find out their find out here is really joy in serving jesus christ no wonder they were so happy we came back after the afternoon meeting and i got a prayer card one thing i remember of the meeting was how they stressed jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i did not know one scripture for healing being brought up in the meth modernist church only i thought if god made the universe and all its wonders and made me then it would be a small thing for him to heal my body i bowed my head and asked god if it were his will to heal me to find a way that is all i said i did not know the bible says by his stripes we are healed i got a prayer card brother branham came and preached after the preaching service brother branham called j25 through j50 prayer cards mine was third in line j27 so i went knowing if i stood before this man of god i'd be healed when i came into the line brother branham said he saw me in darkness he said do you believe in god's prophet i said yes brother branham said if god reveals to me what's the matter with you and if jesus heals you will you serve jesus the rest of your life i said yes brother branham told the audience to bow their head and placed his hand on my head and rebuked the devil of alcohol from my life in the name of the lord jesus christ and i left the platform free i felt so wonderful to know for the first time in my life i was free who the son sets free is free indeed jesus christ healed my body in a matter of seconds where to everyone else i was a problem praise his holy name i was having a meeting all my own when i left that platform my how glad i was for i had something i longed for all my life in christ a lady came to me and said she felt so sorry for me and i told her she didn't have to for jesus had healed my body and i was fine she asked me if i could call her daughter i asked her three times what was wrong with her she said she was a confirmed dope addict the fbi could not even find her for a matter of months and she had come home now she was a dancer with fred a stare and needed help well she gave me her phone number and told me to call her collect i had to for i had just lost a good job people told me not to call her also my mother told me not to call her and get mixed up again well that night going home from hammond indiana after just being healed we stopped for coffee or ice cream don't ask me what i ate for i don't remember i was too thrilled that night came that night came to that night i came to god asking him to show me i was saved for i knew i was healed i asked god to forgive my every sin i had ever committed against him for i was sorry i waited for about 10 minutes lying there on my bed with my arms outstretched my very soul left my body went up to the ceiling and i was afraid i called my mother and she said i was just saved i was so glad the next morning being saved and healed i got up and ate and told my mother i felt a strong urge to call that girl i went to the phone and talked 45 minutes to this girl she found every excuse not to go to the meeting then she asked me how i knew i was healed i told her we had tried everything else so let's try the lord jesus i went to the meeting the next day after i was saved and healed and met the girl first time i had ever seen her in my life she got a prayer card and her number was called she asked me if i would go with her in the line i did and she asked me what she should do i told her to forget everything else and just believe jesus imagine i was just saved and healed the night before myself and was acting like i knew what it was all about she was last in line and brother branham prayed for her jesus healed her and how happy we both are when we saw one another tears running down our cheeks knowing it was the power of god that set us free that's right how wonderful to serve christ that's right the lord is wonderful jesus gave me a good job after prayer and i'd pray for a raise and i'd get them too there's nothing too hard for god amen one week after i was saved and healed i went to the meeting i went every day after that until the end of the meeting a man went with us that was an alcoholic and also my mother's my mother and dad after brother branham had preached he called for the prayer cards my dad had prayer card r 60 too large a number to be called so i bowed my head and prayed i asked god to heal the alcoholic man like he did me also to heal my daddy and save him brother branham turned around and said the girl up in the balcony was healed a week ago of the same thing as you are sir she is praying for you and also she is praying for someone else it is her dad have him stand up you put your hand on his head and have him accept his hearing and salvation i always pray first then i ask for my vacations to go to brother branham's meetings i find every time i go i find help i feel privileged to get to go to as meeting as many meetings as i do and truly thank god god has smiled on my life my dad started going to sunday school in church with mother and me truly i have a brand new life in christ second corinthians 5 15 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature behold old things are passed away behold all things are become new let me say one thing i've never craved drink since that night july 11 1952 also the lord took the habit of smoking away too so now i go to jail services and try to win souls to christ also in skid row i go to small churches in large numbers large churches anywhere i can testify for christ for he has done so much for me i could never thank him enough the bible says he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and that shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life i could not witness to people like i do now if it if i were in my old self for i would be ashamed but i am not in myself any longer i am in christ jesus jesus said because i live you shall live also i am so glad for a christian mother that would not give up even though she was made fun of in our neighborhood etc but now in our home but now our home is a happy place i'm so glad that jesus said i am come to set the captive free i truly thank god for his mercy and love to me god heard my mother's prayers saw my honest heart wanting to be free and sent his prophet the reverend william branham to hammond indiana to bring christ to my life truly i have the greatest christian respect for brother branham and truly he is the prophet of god i am so glad that jesus saw me and understood and knew i wanted to be free praise his name here we stand once again on july the 11th and his word is still the same and we're still pushing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so whether it's something you're struggling with whether it's someone you know a friend a family member be like this mother who never gave up the doctors gave up the father gave up everyone around her gave up and even when you see someone you don't understand how they could be living the way they're living or going through what they're going through and it seems to you like they don't even want help but god knows their heart and as they physically can be seen running away god is reaching out to their heart bringing them back stay in prayer stay praying the god will reach them where they're at because god has a reason a purpose because look at this lady here she was an alcoholic and within 24 hours of being delivered she'd already taken her testimonies to someone else and they were delivered and within one week's time another alcoholic was delivered and her father was healed all on off of her testimony so let us take our testimonies and never let them go but move forward in jesus christ and continue to express it to people you can be set free because he's still the same yesterday today and forever i just have about 20 copies here anyone who wants one can have one take it with you put it in your bible share it with somebody it'll be back in the foyer if we run out i'll bring some more on wednesday thank you god bless you brother jordan that was a wonderful testimony and i believe all of us can relate to that in one way or the other god has moved on our behalf and that is why we are here to show gratitude god bless you brother jordan once again if a good shepherd ever have a radio station uh malakaya for 5.6 well make sure you become the newest anchor amen praise the lord yes so shall we stand for the original scriptures matthew 15 matthew 15 26. matthew 15 26 i read but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs shall we pray our lord and our savior jesus we thank you for the scripture we have read we thank you for the testimony lord that was read a while ago by our brother brother jordan we thank you that you have already said you know the atmosphere in order we are so very much grateful for blessing us father oh god in advance and we are looking forward further to what you have for us this for the rest of this afternoon for this morning stroke afternoon and we are praying father oh god that you will come behind the reading of your word and glorify yourself and father there is a prayer request here for peter who is at a hospital not doing very well he's been admitted today is his second day we pray father as the bible says we are we by your stripes we are healed we pray may you minister healing unto him o god may you send your holy angels father unto him with healing in their wings father to minister unto him and deliver him father o god and set him free completely we are trusting in you father for there is nothing impossible in thy name this are my father we ask in jesus name amen shall we be seated praise be to god thank you lord jesus the title of my message this morning is from dogs to girls by divine intervention praise be to god amen from dogs to girls by divine intervention now brother jordan if you do me a favor the gods just put all that in small areas in lowercase gos praise be to god what a wonderful god we serve i am here this morning to tell you how much of a dog satan is and how much of a god the god we serve is and if you have not made up your mind and you are still hopping between two opinions today is a good day to decide where you stand today is a day to flee from the devil's camp under the wings of the most high god and to be part of the economy of god praise be to god today is a good day to get under his wings if you want to be a part of what he is doing there was this day i came down to the break room i was at work then i sat behind my computer i mean it's a computer everybody uses in the office i sat down behind one and i said i said satan you are a dog and i said it again i said satan i say you are a dog and when i said it i said it to me an insult and i will insult satan any day of the week any hour of the day but then after i said that it was like a voice spoke to me that you didn't insult him then i sat down i said but what did i do praise be to god that that is who he really is that is who he is i said oh then my mind started spinning and that was how i came to this story now when you hear somebody say satan is a dog you say oh it's like this brother he's finished with his life and he's looking for trouble for us get ready to fight if you are not fighting now then there is a problem somehow we are ought to be fighting in one way or the other you are fighting praise be to god you are either fighting for god or you are fighting against god if you are not guarding with him you are scattering if you are not fighting for god you are fighting against god if you are not for god you are against god if you are not a friend to god you are an enemy praise be to god so in one way or the other we are all fighting may praise be to god look if it was before you accepted christ i would say be careful but if it is after you have accepted christ i will tell you there is nothing to be careful about like the three hebrew children the said king we are not careful to answer you in this matter our god is able to deliver us and if he is not able we are not going to bow we are ready to die praise be to god and i don't care what it is that you are going through when the enemy comes against you and you share the name jesus he will show up praise be to god and whenever god shows up the devil freezes up in his tracks [Music] praise be to god the lord our god is our life we are serving a living god how can you serve god and fear satan my goodness over our dead body you can't serve god and have the fear of god in your heart and fear satan at the same time it doesn't happen like the disciples when they were crossing the sea with the lord jesus behind the boat sleeping and there was a storm the devil wanted to capsize us that the boat oh there were experienced fishermen on that boat peter was an experience he was not a he was not a novice he was a veteran and he thought he could calm the boat the harder he tried the harder he failed until they remembered that jesus was behind there and they turned to him master cares doubt that now we perish and when he rose up he rebuked the storm and they said what manner of man is this praise be to god in the midst of the storm when he shows up the devil freezes in his truck so if there was a time to look for trouble it is now and when you go looking for trouble don't look for the small ones [Music] praise be to god remember that the battle is not your battle it is the lost battle look for the big ones because you know he is there praise be to god from dogs to gods by divine intervention praise be to god and remember that we are fighting a defeated foe he's been defeated already all we have to do is charge on the enemy when david took down goliath all those people that were behind and was so scared to death when they saw goliath what did they have to do they just had to charge up on the enemy the devil says that god says the devil belongs under our feet that is why he belongs we give the devil too much respect [Music] you give him one yard he will take 10 years and before you realize he has taken a mile don't give him any room he doesn't deserve it he is under our feet and if the devil is under our feet and he is not giving up why should you that is winning why should you give up he is under your feet and he has not given up why should you give up praise be to god this scripture we just read it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs remember god is everything satan is not god is light satan is darkness god is peace satan is war god is love satan is hate god is joy what will be the opposite of joy satan is sorrow if i should ask you what is the opposite of god everybody who says satan which is correct but today i want to say that the opposite of god is dog and that is who he really is praise be to god we all know the story about this television woman whose daughter was versed with an evil spirit she may have tried everything she knew and nothing was working and when she heard the lord jesus was around the course then she went because she knew that if she could talk to him something would change and when he got there and she cried out son of david son of david my daughter is vice with a demon i need help crying out and the lord jesus would not even mind her and she was following and crying and shouting tell the disciples god vexed and said why don't you send this woman away and the lord jesus turned to her and said i was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the children of israel and you would think that was going to send the woman parking that was not enough she came and fell at his feet and worshipped him crying that helped me i need help for my daughter and i said that was not enough jesus told her i cannot take the children's bread and cast it to dogs that was a hard statement isn't it and you would think that was going to stop her but she said after fact she didn't fight with that statement she didn't have to struggle with it she said after a fact that is true how be it the dogs feed on the cramps that fall from the master's table praise be to god and the lord jesus said woman great is thy faith and let what you look at your will i mean whatever you are asking for be gutted unto you and right that moment her daughter got healed praise be to god a lot of the times we don't see the hand of god because we are rebellious to the world when the world comes to us the world that is coming to perform in us the world that is coming to deliver us the world that is coming to break those chains the world is coming to change our nature we fight against that word and once you fight against it you defeat the purpose of god in your life she didn't fight it she said yes it is true you can't give it to dogs you are right you can't give it to dogs yes there is nothing wrong with you you can't give back you know what the dogs feed from the crowns praise be to god now when i started looking at this a lot of the times you look at it and say no it was an insult now i want to be very careful in the words i choose here that to some extent it was an insult but to a greater extent it was not an insult praise be to god now just imagine that i'm a poor man there is nobody poor here there is nobody poor you may be behind your bills uh whatever you may be going through financially it doesn't mean you are poor we are rich in christ praise be to god but just imagine that maybe i am poor and now you are taking care of me you are feeding me every morning every afternoon every evening you clothed me you have sheltered me and everybody in the neighborhood knows that this is what is going on in other words it is no secret there is no secret about it i go to your house every day people are seeing me but just imagine one day in the midst of the same crowd who already know what is going on you can stand and say oh look at that poor man coming again oh this man is poor i have been feeding him morning afternoon evening if it was not for me this man would have died oh my goodness i believe i am going to lose appetite right away praise be to god i don't think i even want the food anymore i'm going to feel so belittled so dejected so insulted but people already know about it but for the fact that you can just talk about it in the way you didn't it just kills my spirit so yes the woman knew she was a dog but for the lord jesus to tell her we can't take the children's bread and cast it to dogs oh that was a hard statement and she had a right attitude praise be to god and the right attitude before god changes situations praise be to god yes and it was not insult because now if you look at it that statement i cannot take the children's bread if it's not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs it was a figurative language with spiritual connotation amen now we all know that the children's bread it's not corn bread it's not red bread it's not potato bread [Music] we know it is healing so if it was healing and not natural bread the bread would bake why should be why should the recipient the dog be a four-legged dog it was not a four-legged dog but his his two-legged counterparts praise be to god it was not a physical dog a human dog here for that matter because you don't give healing to um a german shepherd or is it cha-cha-cha-cha you know the various breeds praise be to god so it was just not a physical thing here so it was given healing not to the children to gentiles no yes sir the gentiles know that was why he could tell the woman that i am not sent but unto the lost ship of the house of israel be to god the israelites the jews had nothing to do with the gentiles so much so that even when the lord jesus himself sent the disciples to go out he told them do not go in the way of the samaritans or the gentiles that's right praise be to god so it was no insult a dog was simply somebody that was outside the economy of the almighty god that made you a dog it was no insult to be outside the economy of god worshiping idols the worshipping trees worshipping the sun the moon the sea inside of the almighty god you were a dog it was as simple as that and remember satan is a dog you don't have to be satan to be a dog all you have to do is accept his lies and walk in sin and that makes you a dog i remember we are talking about from dogs to gods by divine intervention praise be to god now i just want us to decode the time dog a little here i believe we are all on board at this point but let's just go to revelations 22 15. revelations 22 15 and i read for we doubt are dogs and sorceress and humongous and murderess and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie without praise be to god they are not talking about a natural dog here philippians 3 2. you don't have to open if you have your pen and paper you can jot it down and read that later praise be to god philippians 3 2 dogs are coupled with evil workers beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concession for we are the circumcision which worship god in spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh praise be to god so if you are not worshipping the god of their fathers the god of abraham of high school of israel you were considered a dog you were outside of the economy of the most high god prayers be to god when you go to matthew 7 6 i will not read that um maybe just take a little a small part of it that you don't give that which is holy you don't cast it to pearls or swines and the only holy thing there is is god the only holy thing there is is god and in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god it's like giving the word of god which is a pale to a swine somebody that doesn't know the value of it they trampled over it and what do they do they get to you and they harm you and that is an evil doer praise be to god second peter 2 20-22 like a dog going back to his vomit and simply talking about an evil doer going back to their evil ways praise be to god now i believe that the encounter that goliath and david had i believe that it was one on the basis of who was a dog and who was not it was like goliath pronounced judgment on himself when he looked at david and said am i a dog that you come against me with steps praise be to god was goliath philistine he was a dog not just a dog but a very big one praise be to god and he had already pronounced judgment upon himself and that was why the battle ended before it even started amen praise be to god it ended before it started so in a way you are saying that no if i am a dog it is okay to come against me with this steps and he forgot that he was one press be to god from dogs to ghosts by divine intervention now in the message revelation the book of symbols 1956-0617 the prophet speaking look at paul a prisoner he said the lord jesus a jew sent to the gentiles his people excommunicated him as quickly as he turned to the gentiles there is a lot of reading here i would not i would just skip i'm going to skip all that get to the very bottom of it and then we'll read a little more paul was excommunicated as soon as he got in he just went to the gentiles it was not an easy thing it was unlawful for a jew to have something to do with a gentile yes that's right so much so that when when when peter one peter went to the house of cornelius we all know the dream the vision he had all that it is going to take a lot of time so i'm just going to zero in on that the bible says while he was yet speaking the holy ghost fell upon every one of them in the house of cornelius and peter said can we forbid them water seeing that they are baptized with the holy ghost when the brethren in jerusalem heard of it the summons peter you are a traitor you have betrayed us why did you have to go to the gentiles and he had to tell them the vision he saw and how god led him and that settled the matter praise be to god and they said oh if god has done that done that among them then they have become one of us praise be to god amen thank you lord so i'm jumping over i magnify my office in the lord paul's speaking how the love of god constrained him to god among the unclean gentiles the prophet speaking who were who were considered dogs but paul said i magnify my office in the lord because he is giving me the opportunity to go minister to the dogs otherwise jesus himself regarded a gentle woman like we are as people here set a phoenician woman and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs she said that's true lord but the dogs are willing to eat the scraps that falls from the master's table that got him that woke up the holy spirit knowing that soon the jews ice was going to be blinded and he was going to turn to the gentiles praise be to god it was just god in the background working this out so the gentiles being dogs was not going to last forever else will not be here talking about these good news praise be to god yes in that in the message there's a minor church age paragraph 6 the prophet said and i quote you never wear a pig or dog turned into a sheep praise be to god you never wear a pig or a dog turn into a sheep so from before the foundation of the world you were a sheep to begin with we worship to begin with but do you know that if christ had not come to die for us you are going to be a sheep from the foundation of the world you will come into the world as a sheep excuse me you will leave as a sheep you will die as a sheep and you will end up in hell as a sheep you were going to end up in hell as a sheep if christ had not come to die think about it john on the island of patmos who was more of a sheep than john who was more of a sheep than john but when the angel told john asked him is any man ready to take the book and to open and to losing the seals thereof and there was nobody john said there was nobody there was no man in heaven there was some men on the earth and there was no man beneath the earth that was it was dead silence and john started to cry why was he crying was he not a sheep john was a sheep why was he crying because he knew that that book had the answer to a redemption and without anybody taking the book to open it man was doomed and when he started crying the angel told him do not cry because the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book and to losing the cease thereof and when he turned to look right in the midst of the throne was a bloody ship as if it was slain from before the foundation of the world praise be to god but he was a sheep he knew it but he knew that without that book being opened man was doomed praise be to god amen now look at it it was by a divine hand it was by a divine hand david said in sin did my mother conceive me in iniquity was i shaping come to the world speaking lies look at it even though you were a sheep from the foundation of the world because of what happened in the garden any man that was born was burning to sin you didn't have to tell the first lie you didn't have to steal the first cookie you didn't have to do the first wrong every man that was born was born directly into sin so you were a sheep in the inside and a dog on the outside that is a mixed identity and a mixed identity would never inherit the kingdom of god a sheep in the inside a dog on the outside light in the inside darkness on the outside god in the inside satan on the outside good in the inside evil on the outside praise be to god life in the inside death on the outside that you come into this world and you are doing all the wrong things because of the nature of sin that you are carrying the redeemable you in the inside and the unredeemable you on the outside and a mixed identity can never inherit the kingdom of god and you are wondering so oh it doesn't matter i would have been a sheep in the inside if christ had not come i would have still gone to heaven you are telling lies because brother brother said that the only thing that is going to make it is the nature of god is the nature of christ now just think about it that before christ came to pay for the sins of the world and our sins for that matter god had already made a provision for the children of israel that if they committed any sin they just had to come with a sinner friend an atonement was made on their behalf and god forgave them but there was something that even though they were forgiven that never gave them a nature change they still left with the same nature that offering did not change their nature and if the nature of christ is the only thing that is going to make it then where do you stand your sins have been forgiven and you are still carrying the same old nature where do you end up where do you end up thank you praise be to god so talking about a dog and don't forget satan is a dog talking about a dog if if if the dog in america here is all you know then you have not known a dog yet praise be to god oh yes because the dogs in america they have their own police force that if you even whip your dog and your nobody hears you whipping a dog he will just call the police and the police will come and arrest you for whipping your dog they have their own court the human beings will judge you for that dog it is okay to put two men in a rink and let them box themselves to death but the first time somebody ever put two dogs together in a ring almost everybody in america wanted a piece of his meat on their dinner table i don't know he was he was uh exposed i think he was the footballer in america here how many know that story you remember he says christian okay beautiful the first time that ever happened so all if all you know is american dog which have their food prepared hygienically that you can go to the store and they have their own department with their own shelf and they have their vitamins they have their carbohydrates they have their protein and you can go and select and if the dog doesn't like it you can carry it back and change it praise be to god like you are in a chinese restaurant when you go for something it's not testing while you're going dump it and go for another one then you have not known a dog yet and in some cases that does even have more rights than some of us i wonder what is his brother talking about my brother-in-law was a truck driver i came to the united states for a driving truck i think he saw probably some eight years ago and he always used to have problems with the police they will come under under negative 10 20 degrees his truck is on and the police will come and tell him put it off you are polluting the atmosphere and he will be arguing with them until one day somebody told him justin why do you keep arguing with the police they said no should i turn it off and die he said no get a pet either put a cat or a dog in your car when the police comes and tells you put it off tell him i have a dog in the truck and that settles it [Music] so that means that it's okay for the human being to die but it's alright for the dog to live that means that god has more rights [Music] and that can only happen in america so if it is the american dog you know which sleeps side by side with your owners in the same bed and then you see them in front of the car with your seat belt and some even have clothes on and you see them with your bow tie small and you see a small hat and that is a dog but american dog i am not talking of the over privileged and the spoiled dogs you see in america that is not a dog i'm talking of but i'm talking of their counterparts somewhere in the world now when you even look at the the narrative that the lord jesus had with this tradition woman you can tell because listen to what the woman said that of a fact it is true how be it the dogs feed from the crumbs that fall from the masters table and i can relate to that coming from that part of africa that the only time the dogs would eat is when the master is done eating [Applause] that they will not eat the whole day but they have always been stabbed so much that they know when it's time one is meal time in the evening and they will come and let's see the master is eating looking at his father's face when the hand is going to the bowl they are looking there when the hand is going to the soup they are looking there when the hand is going back to the mouth they are looking there if you don't even take time the dog will choke you he's just sitting there waiting and when you take the meat and you eat the meat and you try the bone it's just waiting for it if you just jump and grab it when you are done eating it will come and pick what is left on the floor now i want you to look at this we are taking it physically oh transported in the spiritual life that the dogs in this era of the world even though they have an owner the owner doesn't care about them the only time he lose for them is when it is hunting time and he wants some bushmeat that is when he goes round have you seen my dog have you seen my dog apart from that he doesn't care where they sleep why they eat what they eat if the luck the dog is looking for water to drink it goes to the most unlikely places to go and drink it would eat from the dump it just roaming in the bush looking for something to pick he doesn't know what they call a car if you want to force it into a kite to bite you because all his life it has never sat in one you want to put clothes on it like we see here you will kill the dog because it will run and roll a rolling road because it wants to take it off it will end up in the street a car would knock and kill it when it's raining that is the only time they get to take their bath there is no place in the inn for them they are just outside whether rain or shine they belong there when they are sick if the master knows how to eat the dog then the dog is in trouble else they have to recover fast nobody cares about them and where i used to live in northern ghana it was a trunk road i don't want to mention that try because we are on a noun before one day i go to ghana and the brothers say you were saying this about us i'm not going to say that you know what the people who go they walk they travel far from that place of the region and they go and buy the dogs and they will chain the dogs one dog to another one dog to another and you have one person leading about 60 to 80 dogs and they are following him they will walk hundreds of miles to that place at that place in that part of the rigid is a delicacy they eat dogs it's a delicacy there and then he's transporting them and you see these dogs following and you can tell that these dogs have been starved they go to a place you'll sit down to rest more and maybe this uh master would come bring down water and they would just drink a little and maybe they'll look into his face oh this man is kind and they don't know that he's a killer they don't know that their meat has already been advertised they don't know that there is a long queue already waiting for their meat and the man will hypnotize them and drag them to the slaughter oh my goodness think about it how the devil would delude people dilute them impoverish them just think about it before you came to the knowledge of christ some of the things you did nobody cared about you they didn't care where you slept why you woke up that this you did what you didn't do nobody had time for it it is not to say that you fell from the tree no you belong to a home but spiritually you were living a dangerous con in a dangerous condition that you knew deep down yourself that if i should die today there is no hope for me nobody had to tell you you went around you belonged to gangs you went around stealing breaking into people's homes committing adultery committing fornication drinking fighting think about it all those things what is it is the devil that has deluded the people with an evil spirit and they are living that life that you know that there is no place in the inn for you all you are good for is on the outside and the devil had the people in chains put chains on your waist ankle bracelets on their foot leash on their necks and dragging them to hell and you know that you can't help this condition you can't and you are just following like that dog you are just following follow me to the slaughter and you know that it's just a matter of time you know there is no hope you have given up all you are just waiting is for your tent so you can die and go and the devil will tell you every death is death it doesn't matter every death is no death it matters make sure you get christ don't deny yourself make sure you get a hold of god praise be to god the devil has impoverished the people plagued them with sicknesses with diseases that they are living in error and they are content with it if this is not an evil spirit tell me what it is that somebody is dragging you to your own distraction and you follow anyhow and you are happy you are doing it like that dog killer who is dragging the dogs to their death with a chains with the anchor bracelets with a leash around their necks dragging them to hell oh and somebody sits down and looks at it and say no i have to do something about this situation i will not allow this to continue forever i am going to stop this and by divine intervention by divine intervention it was not by the arm of flesh but by divine intervention god looked down and said no enough is enough i have to do something about this situation praise be to god i will not allow this to continue forever and while we were in the queue just waiting for our turn waiting for the devil to just put his put his his his his cruel knife to our throat god lose now he says now [Music] it's time to do something praise be to god the bible says what were your sinners christ died for us he didn't have to wait for us to turn right a lot of the times we hear people say i am waiting till i stop sin before i start serving god and you will never serve god because you can never do it on your own and if you are able to do it on your own then you don't even need god anymore amen amen while we were yes sinners can you imagine if christ had come he said no it is going to be on the condition that these people must stand right before i die christ will still be here he will still be here if it was not based on unconditional love that i'm going to do it anyhow and it was there was a condition to it that man has to do this before i die he will still be here begging for death because we're never going to do our side of it but why were yet sinners he took taught of us why were your sinners with sin and iniquity weighing us down impoverished with sickness and diseases carrying that old nature the nature of sin which is the nature of satan the nature of the dog and the sheep inside carrying these characters on himself christ out of us and he said no i will not allow this to go on for long join on the island of patmos again by divine intervention when the angel told john to look there he saw a bloody sheep it was god himself providing himself an offering it was not a man's doing god provided his own self a sacrifice yes sir by divine intervention as i have prophesied unto us a child is given unto us a child is born unto us as son is given and the girl shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting for the priest of peace and we know the story how the angel appeared to marry and the holy ghost overshadowed her and she became conceived and gave birth to the son jesus praise be to god it was by a divine intervention it was not a man's doing when john the baptist who else could have identified the lord jesus more than john the baptist a man that was sent to forerun his first coming a man that was sent with a message to get a people ready for his coming who else was in the right office to identify him the most when he saw him he said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sense of the world by a divine hand by divine intervention it was no man's doing now think about it the bible says for by grace are we saved not of works lust any men should boost and grace came with the lord jesus grace starts with him and grace ends with him without him you are simply lost for he is the beginning and the ending of grace he is the way the truth and the life no man come after the father except by him grace now all along we have talked about grace over a thousand times already digression is an undeserved favor a favor we do not deserve and that has settled yes it's a favor we don't deserve thank you jesus but i was prompted and i have to look again that in addition to that this was what i found about grace is the conception that all a christian has or is is centered exclusively in god and christ and utterly depends on god through christ praise be to god all that you are and all that you have is exclusively centered on god and in christ if it's not centered on god and christ you have to think about it again so all grace is saying here is that you cannot make it on your own you have found favor with me and i am here to see you through i am your strength when you are weak your righteousness in your filth peace in your time of trouble your healer when you are sick to give you joy when you are in sorrow and eternal life when sin is dragging you to hell for by grace are we saved not of works lest any man should boast praise be to god don't forget that what we are talking about this morning is from dogs to girls by divine intervention when you look at jacob when jacob was going to bless the sons of joseph manasseh and ephraim manasseh was the oldest between the two and according to the the birthright i mean the buffer always goes to the oldest and when joseph brought them to jacob at this time the bible says that jacob's eyes were dimmed so he could not see so joseph brought manasseh to jacob's right hand side and a frame to the left and so he expected his father to bless them but jacob turned his cross his hands praise be to god and he gave the blessing that belongs to manasseh the oldest to the youngest and vice versa joseph was not happy with it he said no father it was not that he was being rude no but he knew the order of the birthright that it was supposed to go to the oldest and he held his father's hand and his father said no i know what i'm doing praise be to god the first shall become the last and last shall become the first the bible says that he came to his own and he's all received him not but to as many as received him he gave up the power to be called the sons of god praise be to god and at the cross at the cross praise be to god just as joseph joseph's father jacob cross his hands to bless the children at a cross praise be to god the blessing that was supposed to go to the children of the jews came to the gentiles we that were not fits we now were worshipping idols worshipping trees worshiping the sea watching the moon we that did not deserve it praise be to god by grace by grace grace brought us in at the cross he was rejected and all the time they were beating him and he would fall down and he would rise up they would kick him call him names he had a bride on his side he was not going alone even though he was rejected on his side he was going there with his bride and on the cross when he was nailed praise be to god and his shadow is finished indeed it was finished he overtamed the tables 180 degrees the temples were overturned now we there were no fit we that were feeding on cramps cannot sit at table with our lord and our master and feast on the temp on the same table praise be to god that we do no longer have to wait on the crumbs that will sit at the table with him with our conceited dogs have now become gods praise be to god yes praise be to god what a wonderful god we serve [Music] grace has overturned the tables grace has overturned the tables that when he was pierced on the side water and blood came out praise be to god and by water baptism and the holy ghost baptism we find our way back into the body of christ praise be to god oh my goodness you yes thank you what a wonderful god we serve yes on that day when divinity cross path with humanity oh my goodness when he lay on the cross dying he gave his all for us praise be to god grace has overturned the table now he broke the shackles he broke the chains he cut the cold asunder now we that were bound for the slaughter have been set free if you are living in sin it's your choice because a way of escape has been made there is a way of escape that has been made if you are living in sin it is your choice you are still carrying that nature of the dog if you are living in sin amen and not only are you carrying the nature of the dog that makes you a dog to carry still carry the nature of dog on you makes you a dog and if after a wave of escape has been made you choose to still live in sin that is the most dangerous thing i dare say that you are having worse than a dog a dog has no soul when you cut the truth and you eat it that's the end of his life i don't know what is what what about the dog meat but those people they will tell you is the best meat i never eat it before and i don't want to try it i'm not saying if you're eating it it's wrong i'm not saying that i mean if you want to that's okay here in america if you are tempted you go to jail you never come out it's true but where i come from if you go to the police station when the police is asking what is the address don't think he's going to arrest anybody he just wants to go and get his chair grace of attended tables we that were filthy we that was so dirty we thought were so evil so abominable so disgraceful what are the adjectives to even use what are the adjectives in a very miserable condition very pitiful living in a life of dejection working on dangerous grounds and all we were good for was nothing but hell but god by his grace by a divine hand by divine intervention god by his grace came and he overturned the tale that today we can talk about the almighty god being our god amen praise the lord we can talk about having the holy ghost baptism that we can live a clean life and let the world know that in this world we are living there are a people that can live a clean life you don't have to compromise your christian values wherever you find yourself remember that you are called to live the life of an example you are light and light shines the best in darkness in the world of darkness if you are alone shine the light don't wait till there are brothers and sisters around you wherever you find yourself whether at work in school in your community neighborhood let the light shine [Music] for that is who you are that is who you are let the light shine for the bible says let your light soul shine that man may see your good works and give the glory to your father which is in heaven let your life so shine before men don't compromise on your values what has this world got to offer you for how long would a man live in this life maybe there are some of you here want to live hundred years i don't want it does it mean i want to die now no yes i love my wife i love my children i love every one of you so i want to hang around for a little while and not only that but i believe i have a lot of digging to do on the devil's back [Music] and it's not because i want to enjoy the vegas and the rice no i have had enough of that already but there is one thing you can never have enough of that is god praise be to god grace not only did grace find us but grace called us by name that when you heard the voice of god something in you responded to it while you say had that doggie nature on you the sheep inside of you when he had that voice he said no something changed grace called us by name and not only that grace wrote our names on the rock [Music] not on the tree back not on the back of the house not in the sun but on a rock there is no amount of rainfall there is no amount of sunshine there is no hurricane there is no excavation that can take the name of the rock [Music] our names were written in the lamb's blood and written on the rock there is no persecution there is no sickness there is no disease there is no difficulty there is no mesh in it there is nothing that can take you away from the love of god god would not save you today to lose you tomorrow praise be to god our names are written in in in the in the lamb's blood nothing can erase it nothing can erase it praise be to god grace has tenders changed our destiny now his death made the way unlike the blood of busan ghosts his blood was strong enough to change our nature from sin to that of god's so you realize that the nature change is very important it's not so much about you saying that your sins have been forgiven but the nature change is crucial it's very important we can never over emphasize that if the blood of bulls and ghosts could forgive the people their sins and couldn't change their nature that they had to go back and do the things they were doing so much that god has to send his only begotten son to come and die to forgive us our sins and change our nature he tells you how important it is to have a nature change you don't have to profess to be a child of god and you still carry the doggy nature you still carry the sin nature on you that when you get among the people of the world you fit incorrectly and you can't even be more than them and now when you get among believers and then you fit in there no there is something wrong with the picture light and darkness do not have any fellowship of any kind wherever there is light there is no darkness because there is light you can't have the nature of god the nature of god to which we have been called and still be running after the chance of this life still living in sin doing things you know you are not supposed to do that you look on your shoulder to see if there is a known face any time you get to a place and you want to do something and you have to look across your shoulder don't do it you know within you that is wrong praise the lord praise be to god john 10 33 35 you can note it down the bible says ye are gods unto whom the word has come ye are gods unto whom the word of god has come the almighty god is coming for god's on two feet it is the word of god in you that makes you a god small g.o.d the word of god in you when you accept the word when you embrace the word of god when you are working in the word when you are living according to the word when the word becomes your absolute praise be to god guess what you are the white on two feet you have become a god because the word of god has come to you and that is the same way it is if you embrace the devil's lies and you are living in sin and you are living in iniquity and you are doing this you are not supposed to do you have become a dog the almighty god is coming for god on two feet and that is going to be spirit of his spirit flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones praise be to god he is coming for god um so when saul went to consol the witch of endor and then he had the wish of ender to cost him well for him i don't want to go through the whole story i wouldn't want to keep you here a minute longer than i'm supposed to praise be to god and then the witch of endo called samwell what did the witch of endor say he said i see ghosts arising from the earth so that means you have to be a god while you are alive to be a god at horizon you can die a dog and rise up a god it cannot happen you must be a god while you are still alive that when you are going down you are going down with the expectation that on that resurrection morning you are going to rise up praise be to god okay you know it looks very much like the witch of another said i see ghosts arising praise be to god my soul went there to ask the witch to bring forth what someone by the way says i see god's arising that means it was not only somewhere who rose up praise be to god there were a people that had believed in someone's message there were a people that were living according to this is his word and i believe when he rose up they thought it was the resurrection morning they also rose up somewhere we believe that message where are you going he said oh listen to what someone said he said so why have you disquieted me he was having his sleep and i believe that he didn't only disquiet somewhere alone he disquieted a lot hold fast hold fast to what you have believed hold fast to the message of the hour give it your all live by the word of god or bear the prophet's word live by the word of god and one of these days when the trump goes off praise be to god the bible says that that will crush a rise first we shall meet up in the air water rain or shine we shall defy gravity one of these days praise be to god he said i see ghosts arising your life today determines where you're going to spend eternity don't think you can live any crooked life a sinful life live a shameful life live a daily life and then when you die something will change that you will change from a sinner to a saint or from the dog nature to the nature of christ no it has to be while you are alive [Music] you must be a god while you are alive [Music] so you can be one at arizona praise be to god now in the message demonology in the message demonology the prophet says the only hand that christ has tonight is our hands all the lips he has he is certain by the father he is sent the holy spirit back the third person the trinity to bear record of his being which is god god that does god in us and the bible said we become jesus he said we and we become gods in a form scripture says so see we are gods because why we are the sounds of god um that way we are we just because i'm i'm i'm i'm ibrahim because i come out of that branham branch and in that way we are sons of god offspring of god you believe that prayers be to god so grace brought us in even though we are sheep in the inside he had to come to die for us because a mixed identity cannot inherit the kingdom of god praise be to god we can talk about the king who organized a wedding feast you know for his son i really want to go into that so much but just to summarize it those to whom the feast was organized didn't show up and we all know the story and he asked his servants to go out there and just invite anybody that would come and the people that did not deserve it their names were not even in spite they were those who ended up in the hall to have the feast so are we praise be to god salvation was of the jews it was not for you and i but god in his divine wisdom made sure they were blinded so we the gentiles can come in this is the greatest opportunity the greatest opportunity any human any mortal could ever get there is nothing that compares to it the book of isaiah 1 18 says come and let us reason together say the lord do your sins be as scarlet they'll be as white as snow though they be as red as crimson they shall be as wool praise be to god the greatest invitation any mortar could ever get it's not to the white house it's not to the queen's palace the greatest invitation any man could ever get that the almighty the almighty god is saying come and let us reason together praise be to god what grace has done you can't compare that to anything under the sun if you have to live in a homeless shelter in order to manifest christ do it if you have to sleep in your car boot to manifest the beauty of christ in your soul do it if you have to live on a half loaf of bread for people to see the beauty of christ in you do it whatever condition you find yourself in do not compare yourself to others around you you are not called to compare yourself to others we are called one standard and that is god don't look at others not even brothers and sisters around you because the bible says they don't compare themselves to one another are not wise if a brother or sister is not living right you talk to them the best you can if you have to pray for them but do not descend to their level no we are called to live an exemplary life don't settle for anything don't settle for anything other than god make sure that you have gotten ahold of god it is not enough to come to church it is not enough to read your bible because there are people out there who read who go to church every single day but their lives do not portray christ their nature has not changed the nature change people must see christ in you because the bible says we are written epistles sin and read of all men your life is an open book people must should be able to read to read the bible through you christianity is not lived it's secret no a christian does not have a secret life amen your life is an open book that everybody can read from that they look at your life and they can see christ in your life glory be to god that is why the bible says you will not light a lamp and put it under a bush praise be to god i'll i'll i'll be leaving you here late in about five minutes so come and let us reason together oh what a wonderful god we serve that he has picked us picked us from the gutter i don't know about you but the gutter he picked me from it's a very dirty one a very dangerous gutter very filthy i don't know about how i mean the gutter you were lying in picnics from the garbage can from the trash can from the boiler i don't know whether you guys know what the boiler is how many of you know hot boilers that's a dump ground that were out there in the liquor parlor were out there in the strip joints were out there in the streets in the drug in the drug pens we were out there and we thought we're living life killing ourselves i will not even we're not showing any remorse we will come and sit down and talk boldly about it and knock our chest as if we did something good that is how wicked the devil is but god by his grace reached his holy hand his holy hand where his hand should not go why the holy hand should not go talking about from dogs to girls it's not to let you see how low you weigh no yes for you to remember it doesn't matter how low you weigh for somebody to pick you up the fellow must go lower than you that he went lower he went lower to be able to pick you up he reached his holy hand where it should not go bad for grace but for grace he allowed it picked us up from our wretchedness from our foolish ways from our sins and from our iniquities and washed us and gave us an identity that we can now say that we are children of the most high god because the word of god has come to us and we have become gods unto whom the word of god has come purely by grace purely by not of works not by the arm of flesh but by divine intervention praise be to god the musicians can come over from dogs to gods by divine intervention if you cherish what god has done for you you would want to live the rest of your life appreciating it and the only way to appreciate what god has done for you is to live by his word that shows how much you appreciate what he has done you don't turn the grace of god into disgrace you cherish it that should mean everything to you think about it this life will surely come to an end like i was saying i shot a while ago i don't want to live up to 100 years no i don't like it get to that place where i will look like a baby and they will be changing my diapers i'm not like i don't like it maybe you would enjoy it i don't want it i don't want to ever get there when the lord is finished with me i want to live when god is done with me i want to go and think about that joy now when that day comes and you are crossing your eyes and you are taking your last breath there is a hope in you oh praise be to god my goodness that i'm stepping out of this flesh but i'm stepping in another one more glorious and now on that day on that resurrection morning oh praise be to god i am going to rise anyhow [Music] praise be to god [Music] do not let the devil fool you this world is gone there is nothing more left just go to work go to school pay the bills whatever you want to do if god does not stop you go ahead but always put god first when you step out there tell yourself that i am a daughter of god tell yourself i am a son of god and when you step out there wherever you find yourself remember that you are a child of god the heaven is looking down to you [Music] when the storms arise tell yourself that you are a child of god and heaven is concerned don't forget that god is depending on you god is depending on you as the prophet of god said the only hence he has it's our hands the only feet he has is our feet god is depending on you we have let god down countless number of times but tell yourself that enough is enough [Music] enough is enough don't let the devil keep pushing you and pushing you and pushing you to your own distraction don't take it [Music] it's a choice you have to make the devil can never force it [Music] people do things and so the devil made me do it no the devil didn't make you do it [Music] it's out of your own lust that you did it the devil didn't do it if god created us and put us on the basis of a free moral agency that you can decide whether to serve god or not then that also tells you that it also applies to the devil you can also decide whether to serve the devil or not it's a decision you have to make decision time praise be to god from dogs once upon a time we were all there to gods as we are seated here today that by the grace of god we have become gods because the word of god has come to us we have become gods that even though we are pleased to be servants he says no i call you friends because the servant does not know what the master does but you do we are pleased even to be dormant in the house of god but he says no [Music] we sit at the same table a table we never deserved and would never have deserved but for the sake of grace through christ [Music] our lives should speak about him from now on for you to know that whatever it is that you are today whatever it is that you are doing today even being alive today is the grace of god it's what god has done for you we can never pay god back what he has done but if we can only live by the word of god on a daily basis to show our appreciation to that god will be pleased to accept it praise be to god [Music] brother one can i call upon you to pray for us as we buy down our hairs i want us to go to the lord in prayer and as brother one prays for us talk to god if there is any area in your life where you know you are lucky you know it better you know it you know where you are if there is any place in your life that you think or you know for sure that you are lacking here why brother one is praying for us just
