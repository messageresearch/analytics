of us expected that after brother Ben preach with the atmosphere I know many were expecting a prayer line many of uh were expecting that the preacher will say those that want to be prayed for come up to be prayed but you see I love what the Holy Ghost does and whenever he does that because the the the the the intention of the ministry is not to bring you to a man what happened this morning the brother exposed you to Jesus Christ for you to get a hold of him by yourself I know many were waiting to say if you want to be prayed for come up to be pray for and sometimes you don't need the preacher to call you if you really need to be prayed for you need to run to the altar you don't need a preacher to beg you to come to the altar before you come but what the Holy Spirit was want was doing is to be able to expose you to the presence of Jesus Christ because he has identified that that ha Hing power is already in you he said the hidden power is in you he never said the hidden power was in him he said the hidden power was in you and he wanted you to get a hold of God he wanted you to reach out use the atmosphere confess your fault get away from your negative thoughts and get a hold of God because God is real he's the same yesterday today and forever the very scripture that we read on on Wednesday night from The Book of Luke is the same scripture that the Holy Spirit brought to you this morning I've given you power over snakes and scorpions and over every manner of evil I have given you power don't rejoice in the power Rejoice because you know that I have given you power Rejoice because you have heard me saying I have given you [Music] power father we want to be very grateful to you we owe you our life we we owe you every moment that we breathe Lord every step that we
