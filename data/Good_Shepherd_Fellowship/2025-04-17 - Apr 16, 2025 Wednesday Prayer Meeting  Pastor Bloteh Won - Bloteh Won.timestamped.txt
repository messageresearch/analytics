[21:35] even know what to do. I pray tonight, oh
[21:38] father god, you said, Lord, the

[21:43] pray that the anointing of the Holy
[21:45] Ghost will move through this building
[21:47] tonight. Oh father, Lord God, I know

[22:27] their homes. Oh father God. Lord Jesus.
[22:30] Oh God. Precious Lord. You know that
[22:32] stronghold, Father. You know what the
[22:35] devil God is holding over their lives.

[22:39] from the breakthrough. Lord, I pray
[22:41] tonight. I pray tonight, oh God, I pray
[22:44] tonight, almighty God, Father, that your

[30:48] then how can we sit there, Lord, and not
[30:51] become concerned, oh God, how can we sit

[31:54] lives. Oh God. Father. Away from the
[31:57] cross. Oh God. Father. Lord. Oh Jesus.
[32:00] As if they have never heard about the

[33:05] the name of the Lord
[33:07] Jesus. Can you think about that tonight?
[33:13] Can you think about that tonight? Our
[33:16] Lord
[33:18] [Music]
[33:19] Jesus, he wanted these very people that
[33:22] was his
[33:23] disciple to stand with
[33:25] [Music]
[33:27] him knowing what he was facing.
[33:30] Even Jesus, our Lord, was asking for
[33:33] help in
[33:35] prayer, knowing what was before him. He
[33:38] was asking for
[33:40] help. He brought all of these
[33:45] disciples. Let me tell you something
[33:50] tonight. It was not the
[33:52] nail that led him to the cross.
[33:55] [Music]
[33:57] He could speak one
[33:59] word and the entire situation could
[34:02] [Music]
[34:04] change. But it was his love for
[34:09] you. It was his love for me that held
[34:12] him to the
[34:17] cross. He would just not redeem a word
[34:20] without
[34:22] price. He wanted to pay the price.
[34:26] And there was no prize greater than his
[34:28] own
[34:30] life. And yet we can give our life for
[34:34] him. We can dedicate ourself to
[34:37] him. We having so many things to do that
[34:40] is so
[34:46] important. We love our name. We love our
[34:50] character that we can give our life for
[34:52] him.
[34:56] [Music]
[34:59] It's too high sometimes,
[35:03] Lord. Am I valid is too
[35:08] wide down on my
[35:13] knees? That's where I learn to stand.

[36:06] Jesus.

[43:39] over with you? Put us on speaking terms.
[43:42] of
[43:43] [Music]
[43:50] God. Your prophet said that's the
[43:53] greatest weapon that you put in the
[43:54] hands of hen and
[43:56] mortar. No weapon formed against us will
[43:59] prosper. Not even a tongue that rise
[44:02] against us in
[44:04] judgment. Because the people of God has
[44:06] the greatest weapon. They have this
[44:08] great explosive that is called prayer.
[44:10] They know how to spend time before God.
[44:13] They know how to lay there and cry to
[44:17] [Music]
[44:24] God. We don't want to be intellectual
[44:27] believers that just know how to
[44:30] argue. We know how to quote enough and
[44:33] quote ourself from the face of the
[44:35] earth.
[44:37] We want to be a New Testament believer.
[44:40] We want to be one of the book of
[44:42] [Music]
[44:45] arts that knows how to get down. The
[44:47] Bible says as they pray in one
[44:50] accord, they lift up their voices in one
[44:56] accord. Heaven could not hold back. The
[45:00] Holy Ghost came down in their midst.
[45:04] [Music]
[45:15] [Music]
[45:25] Yes, Lord. We appreciate you tonight,
[45:29] Lord. We love
[45:31] you. We love you, Jesus.

[1:01:36] people don't come and just take comfort,
[1:01:38] Lord God. Let the Holy Ghost be so
[1:01:40] presence that he will embarrass them,
[1:01:43] Lord God, and bring them to repentance
[1:01:45] and bring them to deliverance, Lord. Oh,
[1:01:48] Father God, may people not just come and
[1:01:51] just find a place to sleep, oh God, to
[1:01:54] just come and waste
[1:01:56] time. Send your power just now, Father.

[1:02:43] experience the
[1:02:44] supernatural in their
[1:02:47] life and beginning to experience habits
[1:02:51] dropping. We don't need to hold to them.
[1:02:53] They are not helping us.
[1:02:59] Father, the gifted ones in our me Lord
[1:03:02] that their gift can come, oh God,

[1:04:45] time. We need the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:52] Not
[1:04:56] just the spirit of God in our life, but
[1:04:59] we need that fire of
[1:05:02] God that will burn and outroot every
[1:05:08] desire is not of God.

[1:10:18] you for
[1:10:21] uh standing in the gap tonight. Amen.
[1:10:25] Praise the
[1:10:27] Lord. And
[1:10:31] uh I just I just had this on my heart
[1:10:34] and and just wanted wanted for us to
[1:10:37] have a prayer meeting
[1:10:39] tonight. Praise the Lord. And
[1:10:44] uh and we want to thank the Lord that he
[1:10:46] pull us through.
[1:10:48] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:51] Praise the Lord. Sometimes it's hard to
[1:10:53] get people praying together in one call
[1:10:56] like this if you are not used to doing
[1:10:59] it and you get all you know uh
[1:11:04] uh but we thank the Lord for doing that.
[1:11:07] Amen. The Lord is faithful when we
[1:11:10] commit things to him. He bring it to
[1:11:12] pass. Amen. Praise the Lord. You know
[1:11:16] all through the week I was just thinking
[1:11:18] about it. That thought that was on my
[1:11:19] mind. How did Jesus approach the week
[1:11:23] knowing that this thing was before him
[1:11:27] for you and I said it's a celebration.
[1:11:29] It was not a celebration
[1:11:30] for praise the
[1:11:32] Lord. You assisting ele
[1:11:36] body how they approach it. And you know
[1:11:39] what I was thinking about?
[1:11:42] thinking that when you read Genesis, the
[1:11:46] Bible says there was no man to tilt the
[1:11:50] soil. Praise the Lord. That is a garden
[1:11:54] language. When you go in the garden,
[1:11:57] when you want to plant, you got to tilt
[1:11:58] the soil. You got to break the ground.
[1:12:01] Jo said in the book of Joy, break up the
[1:12:04] falling
[1:12:05] grounds. The Bible says there was no man
[1:12:08] to tell the soil. And that was the
[1:12:12] reason why God made a man. Praise the
[1:12:16] Lord. You just think about it. And God
[1:12:19] made that man in a
[1:12:23] garden. The first Adam was made in the
[1:12:27] garden. And the second Adam was also
[1:12:30] made in the garden.
[1:12:32] Praise the Lord. He made the first Adam
[1:12:35] in the garden and took his wife out of
[1:12:38] him in the garden.
[1:12:42] The second Adam was made in a garden.
[1:12:44] The second Adam was not made in the
[1:12:46] church. God don't make people in church.
[1:12:50] He make people in the garden.
[1:12:53] The garden is an isolated place. It's a
[1:12:55] private place.
[1:12:57] That's where he made the second Adam.
[1:12:59] Yeah.
[1:13:00] And that was where he also made a second
[1:13:04] Eve because when when when when when
[1:13:06] when Christ surrender his will to God,
[1:13:10] then God was able to break out a blood
[1:13:13] vessel that would bring forth a bride.
[1:13:17] Praise the Lord. Amen. You can only be a
[1:13:20] bride not in church, not by believing
[1:13:22] the message of Brother Brandham. You can
[1:13:24] be a bride by being made in the garden.
[1:13:33] And when our Adam was made in the
[1:13:36] garden, you read the the Bible, the
[1:13:39] Bible said he was in
[1:13:42] language. He was in
[1:13:45] anguage. He was taking it
[1:13:49] serious. Not a five minute
[1:13:53] prayer, not a praying and your mind all
[1:13:56] scatter over the place.
[1:13:59] He was in anguish. He was taking this
[1:14:01] thing serious. It was to his
[1:14:04] heart. It was shaking his
[1:14:09] body. The Bible said, he says, "A spirit
[1:14:12] of sorrow has taken hold of
[1:14:17] me." That's how God made a second
[1:14:21] Adam. to be able to take a bride out of
[1:14:24] him, God had to put him a spirit of
[1:14:28] sorrow, a spirit of mourning anguish on
[1:14:37] him. Praise the
[1:14:41] Lord. You will never come to your
[1:14:44] potential as a Christian if you don't
[1:14:48] have a closet life with God.
[1:14:51] If you don't have a closet life, you
[1:14:53] only have a church life, you will never
[1:14:55] come to your potential as a Christian,
[1:14:58] let's leave the bride
[1:15:01] out. As a son of God or the daughter of
[1:15:04] God, if you don't have a closet life,
[1:15:07] you don't have a prayer life, you don't
[1:15:09] have a garden, you can't make a garden
[1:15:11] in your room where you can get down and
[1:15:13] cry to God for him to break you down,
[1:15:15] you will never come to your potential as
[1:15:18] a Christian.
[1:15:22] You learn all the rules of the message
[1:15:23] and dress the message and you know speak
[1:15:26] the message. You will never be able to
[1:15:28] live it
[1:15:29] out. All you need is just someone
[1:15:33] stepping on your toes and now that old
[1:15:36] anger and bitterness will come out.
[1:15:47] He made the first Adam in the garden. He
[1:15:49] made the second Adam in the garden. He
[1:15:52] took the first
[1:15:54] Eve out of the first Adam in the garden.
[1:15:57] And that's what he did in the garden of
[1:16:01] Gethsemane. That was where the second
[1:16:04] Eve came out.
[1:16:07] Brother Brandham said he did not die on
[1:16:09] the cross. Prophet of God say he died in
[1:16:11] the garden.
[1:16:16] That's where we die.
[1:16:18] That's why we die to
[1:16:32] ourself. Praise the Lord. I'm hoping
[1:16:34] that the Lord will give us good service
[1:16:37] this weekend. Amen.
[1:16:40] Be able to bless us in his
[1:16:42] presence. Listen to our feet and we are
[1:16:44] dismissed tonight. Let's sing that song.
[1:16:46] It's not about power, never by might,
[1:16:49] but by the spirit, said the Lord.
