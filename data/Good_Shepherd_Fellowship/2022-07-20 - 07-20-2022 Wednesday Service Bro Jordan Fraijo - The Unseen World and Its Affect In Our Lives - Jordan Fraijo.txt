amazed at his love and his care the reason why we're amazed is because of our sins that were washed away we're amazed that he could wash them away we're amazed that he could care for us knowing what we know about ourselves we're so amazed let's just sing it one more time just enter into worship let him know let him hear from you tonight i am [Music] i [Music] away oh [Music] is [Music] through

been taken care of lord both past present and future father i have nothing to fear father for you are with me father you've paid a price already father lord we're so thankful father lord for your grace and your mercy lord we just ask you come down this evening father lord and have your way father lord lord we all reveal your presence here in the midst of your people lord just come take full control the rest of this service father send me to the side just use me father lord whatever it is you want to speak to your people father lord may ears be open to hear father lord may the holy spirit and the individual be there to receive from you father lord may eyes come open truth father for you are worthy in jesus most wonderful and precious amen amen thank you musicians you may be seated [Music] my goodness when his presence comes by no wonder there at the building of solomon's temple said that the priests and the ministers they got up to minister and the presence of the lord was so great that they just had to step down and step out of the way you see because it's not about the minister it's not about the minister's message it's not about you as the listener it's not about any one of us as an individual it's not about our opinions it's not about how we feel it's not about how we're dressed none of those things now we there's many of these things that we do in preparing ourselves to come here but all we're doing is doing our best to prepare ourselves and set ourselves to the side so that he can come down and take full control so it's not about being seen or being heard it's about what ali who did there with job he said there's been a whole lot of preachers preaching there's a whole been a whole lot of of the congregation either agreeing with their amens or with their with their rebuttals not liking the message but it wasn't about any of that the point was to get god on the scene to minister directly to his people and that's what it's always been about so when he's on the scene saints all we have to do is is let go and let him have his way that's why his presence is so sweet that's why the when his presence drops and you feel it you know it yes and that's when you have that's where your choice comes in you have a choice to make is do i stay within my own bounds of propriety do i stay within my own uh ideas of of what uh worship should look like what what am i going to do or do i just surrender and let him have his way you see because we that's the thing is even whether in whether under the presence of the lord or any other situation in our lives so many times we are so afraid to be out of control you see and there's but there's only two options there's only two options and that's to go on be under the control of the holy spirit and if you're not under his control then you got to ask whose control am i under yes so if you find yourself resisting his control then where does that leave you you see so many times we think no it's just me that's just that's you know and i get it we all worship in different ways some of us are more expressive because that's how he made us some of us are a little bit more quiet because that's how he made us but you let him take control and you'll still act in ways that you never expected you see that's it's the same way that's why it's called coming under that the inspiration and like intoxication of the spirit it's because just like those who come under the intoxication of alcohol or under some type of influence of a of a of a drug is that when they are actually under the full influence of the intoxication or influence of that drug they no longer have any control of their own that's why they're not allowed to drive they are not allowed on the road because they are not making their own decisions that which they are intoxicated and under the influence of is what's making their decisions and that's the place god's wanting us all to come to is come under the intoxication of the spirit of god let him have control and you won't have to worry if you're making the right or wrong decision because you won't be making any decisions anymore so just let go just let go saints you don't have to all pray for me tonight um kind of as the term they say kind of flying by the seat of my pants i kept my fingers crossed real tight with life and schedules um on sunday because the dan wasn't feeling well but he still was here in church he said well i think i'm feeling a little better and i said oh great because you're preaching wednesday and i got a text about five o'clock or so somewhere around there and let me know he wasn't gonna make it but you know it's not once again like i said it it's just not about us and if we can just lean into the presence of god then then the right things will be said and if you're pulling you'll get what you need out of the service tonight you know i just got a little thought and we'll kind of walk down it i don't want to keep you too late or too long or or or stretch anything out but if you'll just jump in with me and and pull from that end then i'll i'll do my best on on this end and we'll both just let god have his way and just have a wonderful time if we'll go ahead and turn to ephesians 6 12 i'm doing i'm going to take a little thought that i've actually ministered on before in the past but it's been quite some time and don't worry i got i brought all my notes from the previous time i ministered and it took about two to three hours but i'm gonna do my best to pare that down by in to about a short synopsis ephesians 6 and 12 well-known scripture let's read it for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places let's just pray heavenly father lord we've come together here as your scriptures said if two or three would gather together in your name that you would be here father so lord we've done that and we can claim it as a promise that lord here we are so we know you're here also father lord we felt your presence father so beyond even just being able to claim it as a promise your word we felt you we we know you're here father so lord we're just here to hear from you ask you just take these few thoughts father this little scripture just anoint it to the hearts your people father lord and just take and make it a blessing father i pray or we just surrender ourselves to you always ask for our brother dan who's not feeling well or that you'd reached out to him father for lord especially with all he gives to this congregation father pouring out of himself or that you just raise him up father lord quickly and just a quick recovery that he'd just be feeling better father right away but we lay all these things in your hands in jesus name amen you may be seated i just want to take a little thought and what i had titled it was the unseen world and its effect on our lives and with a kind of a what are we allowing to influence us and we don't even know you know here in ephesians 6 and 12 as we read it there is a lot of references to physical struggle but as you read through it you realize that none of the things that you're wrestling against are that of which you can contact with your hands your with your ability to touch feel see here and so right away what that's doing is letting you know that it's beyond your own ability to wrestle it's beyond your own ability to resist it's beyond your own ability to do something about this you see because that's what we're always trying to do is well point me where's the problem point me in that direction and and i'll just keep fighting it until i figure it out you know whatever it is i'll you know in in construction working construction if you had something that you wanted to move and it wasn't moving well you just got a bigger hammer right you didn't actually stop and think about it and how what's a better approach you just applied more force and hoped that it worked out and that's how most of us approach most of the things in our lives even spiritually speaking is we're like well what i what what i'm trying isn't working but maybe if i just do it a little bit better a little bit stronger to you know apply myself a little bit more it'll it'll work out better and then we go do the same thing and then when we come back around we're like wow this is still a problem i wonder why it's because you're still trying to handle a spiritual problem through your own abilities you see and that was never the way it was supposed to be that's why this outlines exactly that we're not fighting flesh and blood it removes us from the arena immediately that's right see if it was something that we could go after so something like in the old testament the lord said okay go and take the land well that's easy you say wow that's pretty scary that's hard you know go into physical battle but you can see your enemy you know who he is you can identify him right off the bat right that's a philistine i'm an israelite that's the enemy when he's dead i've won simple right yes but it's not that way it's not even like during the ox age during the time when so many christians were giving their lives where the ultimate win was to give your life for christ in a physical manner you would go there was many in the arenas as you read the stories back through history where they would be in the arena putting christians to death and those that were the spectators of the acts in the arena were so overcome by the by the courage of the christians that they would convert to christianity in the stands and walk out into the arena and give their life alongside them their christian walk lasted from their decision to serve christ to their walk into the arena that long he said wow that must have been hard to do it had its areas that were hard sure you still have to make that decision but it's nothing like what we face today and that's not to make that any less of them but god is working us up to a place we're going back to the beginning you see we're in a reversal we went all the way out and now we're going we and we went to the furthest point and christ came and gave his life and from that point on we've been heading back to the original right we've got to the place where we're saying now we're going back to eden we're already in that area that where it's folding over the time versus eternity where we're already in that place where god's able to come back and commune with men lift to ear like he did with adam so here we are in satan's eden already in a state where if if you're sensitive to the moving of his presence you can already enter into that same place adam was at walking with god amen we're back there so you got to think then where where are the next steps because it's it's going to be in a reverse pattern so if if in the original you had god beginning right brother madam talks about that little bit that god had to break off that little bit of logos to drop off to actually begin creating because god who filled all space in time and eternity and everything in that form was even too great in that form to do this little work and he broke off that logos light [Music] and began working and began working and began working and and here's he's in heaven and the angels are worshiping and and lucifer is the head of the choir right and the war in heaven happened and and the angels that followed lucifer fought against michael and his angels and were beaten and cast down to earth brother branham tells us he said those who fought against you were there amongst those who fought against lucifer and his angels you were there to tell him no and god the father was so proud of you that he said i'm going to let you do that one more time i'm going to put satan down on earth in a place in a space that is all his own that he thinks he has full control that he is in control of every aspect of life of government that he holds fear both in the animal population and through humanity you see because that's how satan has always worked is through fear it's to cause cast doubt and fear on the people that's even what he did with eve he caused doubt which causes fear they always run hand in hand he calls he cast doubt on god being a good god that would want eve to have everything that she should have by telling her why doesn't god want you to have this aren't you equal shouldn't you know both good and evil who is god to make that decision for you and now there's that little bit of doubt and now a fear of what's what's what's god hiding from me that i should know right that little bit of reasoning right and that fear took control now think about it now is if we're already in that stage in that place where we're folding over in time and eternity and you're walking with god we're about to head back into that place of eternity they were coming back to that place also where you're going to have to come back and do warfare just like in the beginning just like you did at that time with michael when satan was cast down but this time instead of satan being cast out of heaven he's going to be cast from his very own kingdom you see and it's not going to be michael doing it it's going to be michael through his bride go back read the message billy branham said god is allowing it so that the devil he's not going to need to come down and beat the devil himself but he's going to empower this little bride to do it for him he's going to show the devil i don't even need to do this my wife can do it you're so little and you're so insignificant i just send my wife to take care of you and but that's the place we're heading back to so these are the things that we need to be equipped with back to the original back to the the original where it was not a war a physical warfare but a spiritual warfare and that's what we're coming back to that's why you know as we head into this age and we look all around as you see more and more and more devices and mediums by which the devil can contact you you see because he's always lagging just a little bit behind the lord is when god begins working satan's always just trying to copy him that's right it's taken satan over 6 thousand years to get to the point where he can share visions with his followers it's taken him six thousand years to get to a point where he can store up messages and share them with you at a later time god's been doing that from the beginning was as smart as the devil thinks he is it took him that many years to reach it and you know it was only by god's design in the last hundred years 150 years that we've seen technology just explode all over the place right yes the devil thought aha i got him now right i now have a way to contact the children of god every day every moment every hour and bombard them with my message but you know it was all in god's plan do you know why because he was sending a prophet to this last stage that he wanted his voice to continue on after he was gone and so he allowed that technology to be developed it wasn't because all of a sudden the devil got one up on god right the tape the radio the telephone the tape recorder the television the the car the airplane we we all see these as perhaps modern advances in science but they're not they were god allowing men to catch a revelation of something of which he would have a purpose and a use for what they would use that revelation to invent how hard would it been for the the prophet of this last day to go seven times around the world in a horse and cart he would have spent his whole life doing it and just barely maybe made it not only did he personally in physical form go around the world seven times but his voice by way of what people like to call scientific technology continues to wrap around this world and have influence far beyond that which anyone could have could even begin to imagine during his time on earth so here we are back again with the devil and you know we give we continue as a people of god to give the devil way too much credit we do every single day is always be careful with this technology be careful of that technology be careful yeah yeah you should be careful and you know how you should be careful increase your walk with the lord allow the holy spirit to be your guide whether you're walking down the street or walking down the pages of of a website or google or watching a youtube video that's right if the holy spirit is your guide there's no fear there's no fear he'll guide you lead you and guide you in all paths of righteousness no matter the the the way in which you get there there's no need to live in fear live in faith you see because we can put all the hindrances physical hindrances on sin we like but if the desire is still there for you it'll just be a matter of time like the children of israel you know under the bulls and goats for years and years and they had a good heart look at david a man after god's own heart do you think he started out in the morning like you know what today i feel like murdering somebody you know what today i feel like committing adultery no no he was a good man he was a godly man he wanted to do that which was right but he didn't have that keeping power and if all you do is stand there by way of good intentions you'll find yourself in the same place as david over and over again good intentions you'll even read your bible you'll you'll be praying but never surrendering never asking for the guidance of the holy spirit for the application of the reading and the praying you see there's something talking about the unseen world here and i'm just going to use a little bit of my own experience and i'm trying to keep an eye on the clock you know this is just a a little bit of a me and you talking here this evening and so let me just share from my own experience a little bit you know the idea of the unseen world comes from my background in in lab in the laboratory medical laboratory is most of the things by which we live and breathe are so small in my new they can never be seen by the the natural eye what we see is the end product of all those little things working together right like i see you you see me do you see blood cells no do you even see skin cells which is what everyone you would think if you would see anything that's what you would see they're everywhere by the trillions in in numbers you cannot even count in fact when we look at we just for the most part most people like it's skin as a whole it's just skin but if you take that skin and put it under a microscope it's not just one piece it's these little minute cells each one standing in their position each one doing their duty to protect the body and it's when even one of those cells is damaged hurt or removed that now there comes possibility for harm to enter the body that's how important each every and every individual cell is that's where things like cancers come from it's one of your cells it's not a foreign body to start with it's one of your cells stepping out of line and yet it's so small it's so minute that some of these cells in order to see them just recently i was in the lab and sitting at a microscope and you first the the microscope it's just what they call a simple light microscope i'm just going to share this guy every time i do i think it's so good it and it's so applicable to what we know of scripture okay is that first of all the area the areas that you look through have an automatic with a a 10x or 10 times magnification okay it's like binoculars you're looking like binoculars that you're looking through at the top i'm i'm sure we're all very um familiar with at least what microscopes look like and then down below you have on the microscope what they call objectives and each objective is of a greater power right typically i think you have a a 10x a 40x and a 100x which means you multiply the the binoculars that you're looking through at the top by the number of the objective and that's how many times it's multiplied what you're seeing so even the smallest one when you look at through it through the microscope is a hundred times larger in the microscope than it is actually physically and just to give you an idea is when you look at something at 100 times larger some of these cells are still so small all you can do is barely make out their shape now you move up you use that 10x initially just to kind of find out where they're at on your slide to start identifying in what plane on the microscope what plane in the field they're at where are they located once you've located them now you can begin fine-tuning in you'll drop to the the 40x now that which you're looking at is 400 times larger than it is to the natural eye 400 times and even at 400 times larger many of these cells are still not large enough to fully identify to really get a true identification of what you're looking at you have to go to 100 x which is 1 000 times larger now there's something significant with this light microscope when i say light microscope what that means is that you're looking down the slide is a piece of glass that whatever you're wanting to look at is is a thin very thin layer of maybe just one or two cells thick is laid across that slide and underneath is a light shining up through it so that what you're identifying is whatever is that is blocking the light the light comes up around it and that is what it makes so that you can see it and you have to both focus in your vision on your oculars which is your lenses and you have to focus the light correctly or else it still won't work you won't see anything it has to all be in the right place the right time the right situation the right magnification the right amount of light because if you don't have the right amount of light you'll see shapes and shadowy stuff but it all just kind of blurs together in shadows you know that's how they were over the ages coming up dude first church age second church age luther wesley you name it they all began to focus in and the shapes were coming out of the scriptures for them but the light just wasn't quite right there wasn't enough light for them to fully identify it but it was it was it was coming to them they were seeing it they were seeing it and they were so excited but we're at age now here here's the thing that i think is so fascinating is when you get to 100x the objective is so close to the slide so close when you look at it if you were to look at the naked eye and try and see where the objective is and where the slide is to you it looks like they're touching but even at 100 times if you want true clarity you have to take a little bit of oil and put it on the slide and it's the connection of the oil between the slide and the objective that brings it into full clarity you see and that's how it is for us as well as christians is you know we've we've read the book we've read our textbook many many times backwards forwards sometimes we can quote it sometimes we we know the right quotes to tell the right people for the right situation and we feel good about it i know the material and then life hits us right and also we're like well i thought i knew all the right scriptures i thought i knew all the right quotes and it just feels so empty why does it feel so empty i'm quoting the scripture i'm quoting the scripture why is it not coming to life why am i not i try able to identify what is true for my situation right now why well check the light around the word is it is it the right light is it the right is it is it truly illuminated for you is god really showing you something there or you just parroting something that you've read have you become just a tape recorder that everything put in just feeds it back out doesn't just because the tape recorder can record something and then you can play it again doesn't mean the tape recorder has any knowledge or wisdom it was able to store some information and give the information back that's where many of especially young people in the message i can tell you from personal experience we grow up that way in the pews we know the terms we know the terminology we know the scriptures we know the quotes we know the the the what's supposed to be the the right doctrines and what are the false doctrines and what are the you know all the different isms and the message and we know the quote to use to to combat that and we know this and we know that but it takes a real revelation it takes a personal experience beyond that of just textbook learning you see and that's something even i've experienced even in the natural just very down down home here tonight and you can take this in in anything that you've learned think about it is when it comes to identifying certain blood cells and their different stages you know a blood cell is not just a blood cell you know blood cells goes through different stages of growth to maturity and until it reaches maturity it is not fully functional or capable of fully assisting the body it's like many of us we go through the same thing right we're young christians we're on fire we're we're revved up and ready to go and save the world but we don't have the right maturity and experience so a lot of times we run around just spinning our wheels right if you think i'm doing this for god i'm doing this for god i'm doing this did god want you to do that that's right or we we think we're doing all these things we we testify to somebody and we're we we are like the child that plants a seed the child you ever seen a little kid when growing a garden they go out with their mom and they put seeds in the ground and the very next morning they run out and they perch themselves over over the ground like this staring into the ground where they put that seed and unless their mother stops them they will take their fingers and dig that seed back up to find out if it's growing many of us as young christians expect the same thing when we sow seeds is we run out and we plant a seed and we're expecting we're over watching over the balcony we're watching over the watching them okay any moment now you should sprout we don't know what what conditions are for that seed maybe it's a seed that takes a lot longer germination period maybe it's not one or two days or three days maybe it's a week but it doesn't come up in 24 hours or like i knew it bad seed wasn't meant to be write them off no no no no stop it stop it calm down god had you plant a seed that's good don't worry about it paul fully covered this he said he said some have have planted some have watered but god brings the increase he said stop worrying about it plant your seeds share your water and let god do the work stop trying to do it yourself whether it's in you or somebody else if you do it you're going to dig up the seed and you're going to kill it and god's going to have to start all over again see that's where it is you're frustrating god it's like he's like come on just do the part i asked you to do and then let me take it from there stop trying to do it all yourself it's not going to work it's not going to work all right i think i kind of rabbit trailed there all right but that's that's the point is that we're so anxious to see something we did the results of it we're so out to see our own um achievements we want to see our own achievements for god and we we forget it's not your achievement for god it's what god's achieving through you but it's all god's achievements every time so that's what it is and so sometimes we're we're in these different states of maturity and although we can be of some use to the body we got to keep growing we got to keep growing we got to keep coming to that full maturity that paul spoke about that place where now you're at a place of functionality where you can really help the body in the place that god has placed you you see because each cell each type of cell has its own function in the body they don't do all the same thing they're not all red blood cells running around sharing oxygen with everybody here you feel better and you feel better and you feel better that's not what they all do some of them are just soldiers of the cross that are there as constant watchmen over the body so that when there is harm that enters the body they are there to respond they're in constant prayer and supplication they're not a part of the choir they're that prayer warrior off in the corner they all serve a different function and yet none greater or less than the other you see we all we we like to weigh things by what we can see right now because that's how we weigh achievement especially in today's age right everything has to happen quick quick quick quick you know even even our internet speed today if if if we look search for something right now and it doesn't happen in less than a hundredth of a second it's like what's wrong with the internet right but how many of y'all i i am just old enough to where i was around for the beginning of the internet some of you kids who don't remember that but all of you who remember dial-up it would take you an hour to download a video that would take that was when you watched it was less than five minutes and now if it takes five minutes to download a one hour video we're bothered you see but it's just increasing increasingly it's that the age is so rushed it's so pushed it's but even god is in that stage where he said unless i cut time short he said everything is speeding up to the end it's all coming to a culmination why because we're going back why is that you see all of the things in this natural world speeding up because we're going back to the beginning where god said my people will travel as a thought just like just like the evangelist did and went out to the um i know the story but i'm i'm blanking on the name so you help me but there he was he was the evangelist there in the new testament and he was called to the ethiopian eunuch philip thank you phillip you know he traveled as a thought and it wasn't his thought so that tells us something we always think well if i could travel as a thought well that's the problem that's why you're not traveling as a thought yet because your thoughts just go way too many places too quickly you would end up in more trouble than you could handle if you were traveling as a thought right now most of you would already been left and come back to this room five or ten times already but philip traveled as a thought in the father's service you see that is he was so in tune with what god was having him do is here he was in a major revival and he was so in tune that it wasn't even a matter of philip do you want to do this his moment philip is standing here preaching to the crowds and next moment he's on the side of the road and he looks down the road and here's this eunuch in his chariot miles and miles away just like that philip didn't go like huh i wonder if there's anyone that i have not reaching at this revival that i should be talking to lord is there anyone else where should i be going will you take me there quickly it didn't take that he was so in tune with the leading of the spirit that that him and god were thinking as one in the moment and he was so led of the spirit that when the spirit took picked him up and took him it didn't even phase him like he doesn't say philip landed on the road he was rather dazed he didn't know where he was at or what he should do it says philip landed on the road and the first thing he does is he hears the the ethiopian eunuch reading the scriptures yeah and he just walks over like he's been on the road the whole time and walks up to the chariot and says hey do you know what it is that you're reading he didn't like what he was doing didn't even slow down he went from one service of the lord to the next see this is what we're going back to god is walking us back is that we're so even within our own cells sometimes we're so worried about what someone would think or someone will do or what what they would say that when god does move on us to say something we're like oh i don't know what they think of me what well if god's moving on you to say it say it if god's moving on you to do it do it no i say make sure he's the one moving on you that you're not moving of your own volition you're not that immature christian that's just running wild but if he's the one moving and you know when he's moving right you don't you don't need to be like i don't know tonight when when we that song right as when i came up brother hillary had started leading it and you could just feel the presence of god come down was there any question as you moved into worship is god here is god moving on me right now absolutely not you just moved just like that so if you're in a situation and god's moving on you you'll know because it'll just it'll be that natural it'll be like philip being transported of the spirit you'll just be transported into the right time the right place and the right things to say you won't have to think about it because it's a promise he said when you come before kings and potentates he said don't worry about what it is that you will say i will put the words in your mouth so don't worry even if you're not the overly evangelistical type maybe god did not give you the spirit of an evangelist maybe he gave you the more a lesser spirit of a teacher or spirit of someone who who's just got a word of wisdom or whatever it is when god moves on you to share your gift with someone you'll know and all you've got to do is yield you see personally i i don't see myself as a as with an evangelistical gift i see many i've been around many people that that do and men they're on the street they're everyone they meet is just they're they're interacting they're they're drawing on them you see evangelists when they get up here and minister to us they just have a way about them that that they're they they're able to stir you up and that's what that's their gift but even without that you don't think well it's not really that's i'm not an evangelist no but god will call you to use your gift that he gave you to speak to somebody you know many times for me it's it's not in that evangelistical way but i'll find that after a certain period of time when either i've been with someone or worked with someone or been in a certain environment that also they'll start asking questions what about this what about that what about and when they ask questions i give them answers and god i've been in situations where i was about to leave work and this young man who was more agnostic no real belief he began asking me questions you know i stood there for 20 minutes talking to him in the middle of a laboratory where you know they say that the term is a that when people are are swearing they swear like a sailor but if you've ever been in the medical field especially in areas where there's no patience and man and limited management they would put sailors to shame because there is no nothing sacred that all the things that they interact with and all the things that they do nothing is holy or sacred anymore and and to be able to stand in that environment unabashed and unashamed i'm not saying i i was trying to push what i believe down anyone else's throat but as long as he was asking the questions i was given providing the answers yeah and it wasn't me i hadn't like studied up and okay i'm pretty sure and then we're in a whole different part of the world with a different set of people i'm pretty sure david someday is going to ask me questions would never have thought it from him never in a million years as they say but i lived a life that was that that was exemplary of a christian life in the best way i knew how every day when i went into work i said lord i would stop in the parking lot before going in i said lord give me favor and grace with those i work with and let me live and act in a way that is pleasing and of that which would be acceptable of a christian life you see because me and you we don't notice so much the fact that we don't do this or don't do that we just don't do it but in these environments the fact that you do not do or act or say certain things stands out like a like a beacon of light on a hill and they notice and they're going to watch you and they're going to test you so don't get upset when they test you to say thank the lord they are interested that's why if they weren't interested they just leave you alone but anytime there's a new mechanism or a new invention do you know what they do with it they test it something they've never seen before right i mean that's that's our especially as as kids the first time you see an animal you've never seen before out in the woods or a bug the first thing you do isn't like oh that's a nice bug i'll leave it alone you pick up a stick and you poke it see does it jump does it run does it what's its characteristics and not just what is its characteristics when i'm looking at it and watching it but when i poke it what does it do and that's what the whole world is doing with you too is there like well you know why because america and the west the west has been so scoured over with christianity so-called with religion everyone's a christian brother branham addressed this way back in the 50s and 60s he would ask someone are you a christian well i'm an american i didn't ask you that are you a christian i'm a baptist but are you a christian and you know that's the same question everyone else has too is they've met all the people who claim to be christians yes and they poke them before and they went they ain't nothing to them they're just like me and i ain't got no need for something some religion that doesn't do anything more for me than what i got now but when they see something so different they say maybe there's something to this but i won't know until it's been tested and you get upset because you're like ah that boss that co-worker they were all over me all day today they were bothering me that make me so upset that's something you need to work on and i don't mean the co-worker i mean you and your anger problem that's something you need to be talking to the lord about you me whatever it is they so annoy me well that's also something you need to be talking to the lord about yes because he's been long-suffering with all of us and we claim to believe this message we claim to be christians and we still have our failings and our trip ups every day every day i know i do and i know that all the prophets both current and of old when i read their stories they say they did amen every day and yet because someone who claims nothing acts in a way that is less than conducive to that of christianity we get upset about it by what means are you measuring them are you measuring by this them by the same means that you measure yourself and then second of all are you granting them the same grace and mercy that god has granted you i tell you this if you're struggling to get along with somebody at work at school at some type of public function just start treating them the way god has treated you since the day you were born amen you know what it may not change who they are completely but your interactions under them will change you know why because your approach to them will change your reaction to their actions will change and they won't know what to do with that but if you react the same way to them that everyone else does then they don't see you as different than anybody else but god is calling us higher he's calling us to a higher level he's calling us to a higher maturity you see where we enter in that's what it's all about it's about an everyday life and yet it's all being worked on behind the scenes by the unseen world you see because we think it's a co-worker we think it's a brother we think it's a sister we think it's someone against us but it's not it's that same old devil that was thrown out of heaven that's tormenting these poor people and instead of helping them you're aiding him by tormenting them too you see you thought what i said was that's that old devil trying to torment you through those people oh he he would like that but when you do anything less then approach them with the grace and love of god you are aiding and abetting the enemy in tormenting that poor soul because god expects more out of you from whom much has been given much is expected you see when jesus came and i'm just gonna i'm gonna skip way ahead here finish just saying a few things but when jesus came and he approached the law he said i came not to destroy the law but to fulfill it i came not to take away the commandments but to actually magnify the commandments why because the grace that i'm bringing and the overcoming power associated with it is great enough now to where i believe i know that if you'll accept my leadership under the tutelage of the holy spirit you can live up to the new standards that's why he didn't take these things like oh adultery don't worry about it no more all under the blood he said adultery no it's not just a physical act anymore he said if a man even looks upon a woman he's committed adultery in his heart why because we're going back to the original battle which is not a flesh and blood battle but it's a spiritual level we wrestle not about its flesh and blood against spiritual powers of the air so the only way you can beat it is if you if it's challenged at its origination you see by the time you get to the act the spiritual part is far done and over but if we can cut it off here at the spirit you don't have to have to worry about the physical you see physical is always only a manifestation of the spiritual right so that's where we can see and watch ourselves not to beat ourselves down now don't don't take it that way because that's also let me actually let me just read you a brief quote so i think it will tie into this uh here is here's brother branham in actually the message the prophet elisha in 1954 and he's in a prayer line and this ties into the the unseen world and he's got a young man in front of him and he says how do you do young man do you believe me to be the servant of god many other servants are here but i am his servant immediately there's a spirit pulling from this young man this boy is in trouble he's deeply in trouble this boy is some suffering with a mental disorder okay now back then it was very little talked about in the 50s and 60s mental disorders they had asylums and things like that but today if you had to build asylums for all the people with mental disorders anxieties and depressions and and identity disorders of of identity crisis we just build a big fence around the world and keep everybody in which has to guess what we're already doing because it's gone from these physical attributes the warfare is no longer that of the ten commandments don't steal don't kill don't commit adultery worship no other god but it's going back to the original spiritual warfare that it was in the beginning on every level that's why it's so afflicting the minds of the people is it's a warfare at within their spirit and when the spirit is so torn up it destroys the mind that's right you see and that's where we're all at is we're trying to fix our we're trying to look for identity in all the wrong places we're trying to find a fix for something that's a mental or spiritual disorder in a physical realm the whole world is now the whole rest of the world is doing it because they don't want to admit that there's a spiritual application because that takes them in places that scares them to death true but to admit that it's spiritual for us should bring us great joy you know why because we are made more than conquerors the battle's already been won we just sang a song where all our sins are forgiven we can read the scripture where our identity is in christ that alone is enough to cure all the identity issues we don't need to do long deep searches into who we are we are one with christ if you'll just enter into christ you'll know your exact identity it won't be a problem no more you got depression you have anxieties you have fears they don't just go i know that it's not as simple as well just believe and and walk on like many do and then when when you still have an issue like i thought you believed yeah but god god's got his own time he's got his own situation the situation is different for everyone and god will deliver you and bring you out of that thing on his time when he's ready because he's got a purpose for it he's going to have a reason for it that trouble you went through that situation when you went through that battle the mind that you're going through he's building character he's working on you he's he's rubbing off the sharp edges like it's all these things that but yet in the end he said i will deliver you the end result is your deliverance is coming just hold on just hold on let god do the work deliverance is on its way but so many times we we just can't wait for god to do it we're in such a hurry um here it is me this young boy he's got a mental disorder now out of all the diseases that brother random faced you know he talks about the the cancers and things that grows on people's necks that he would pray and they'd fall off on the platform well that was a physical manifestation everyone in that audience could see it recognize it identify it there was a tumor here the tumor is on the ground person no longer has a tumor right or maybe some type of illness like that that relative of florence nightingale over there in england yeah where the picture shows so skin and bones and beyond hope all medical science has written her off to the point where she even when brother man went to pray for her she yeah she went her prayer her thing to ask for the random four was pray god just let me die that's right that was where she was at yeah and so everyone can look at that wow physical manifestation right and yet here's this young man trapped within his own mind trapped within his own spirit we could have a unlimited number of physical ailments you could be lame you could be blind you could be death and yet be free in the holy spirit be free to worship god be unhindered god moving on your life have no effect on your walk with god and yet this young man is so bound up in his own mind so bound up spiritually the devil's got him so tied up he doesn't even know who he is he's lacking and missing his identity even to christ or how about especially to christ and here really random praise for him he says let me just read this whole portion here you've just come from an institution and i see them giving you some kind of shock treatment they give you a shock treatments and you have an a phobia that is you see a face before you all the time and it's your mother's face that you see you're a married man you have a wife and two children jesus christ come along and delivered the man of gadara that that could deliver the man of gadara is here tonight to deliver you from this and take that phobia from you and drive the devil from you know a phobia is simply a a fancy word for fear you have a fear some type of fear any type of fear this and take that phobia from you and drive the devil from you that you can return to your home well do you believe that do you believe that he sent me to do this for you would you bow your heads and be reverend by the way i'm speaking to the crowd this is very treacherous and dangerous keep your head bowed till you hear my voice say raise your head here he is the prophet of god entering into spiritual warfare for this young man's life you say what what do you mean this young man in life he's a fine specimen of a human being maybe he was athletic maybe he was powerful strong in body the body has nothing to do with your life here young man before i ask this blessing i'm going to ask you something will you obey me as his servant and do as i tell you to do you're going to get well the time of deliverance is at hand this is a devil doing this young man he would drive you stark mad keep you that way the rest of your life but god can restore you in your right mind and right mental condition i see another thing you've been to psychiatrists they have see somebody trying to talk to you but that's not the idea it takes more than that for you it takes the power of the living god you understand me if you don't you will in a moment bow your head in reverence and believe that god raised his son jesus to deliver you heavenly father this young man stands here fine looking young fellow standing here in the stature of young manhood and satan has come to him to tear up his home break up his family and drive this young man out into the wilds but o god who made heavens and earth who created all things through christ jesus i come as your servant in a prayer of faith for this young man knowing that just now he can't have faith for himself because of his conditions lord hear the prayer of your servant and satan is haunting at him and making his life a misery but the lord jesus that set the maniac free that was far beyond this boy you can make this boy well tonight and satan you who bound him you've escaped the psychiatrist you've escaped the medical treatments but you can't escape the power of god come out of him in the name of jesus christ go from him young man and i was speaking to the young man look here now it's over you're healed don't smoke anymore live like a real christian go giving god praise and sing his praise day and night raise up your hands and give him thanks for your healing you feel all right now don't you the boy says he's feeling fine now everything's gone when it went an evil spirit went that way with random points of direction god in heaven knows i am not a fanatic we'll be judged at the day of judgment the thing world passed out of the boy going in that direction it even felt like a wind going like that when it left him the evil powers left the boy go get to your wife and family and rejoice and be happy rejoice in the lord bring the lady he's speaking about the next person and how he goes back the first time visible that i've seen an evil thing leave someone for a long time it passed by like a bat like that going from one side and then he goes to begin praying for the next person here but speaking of the unseen you see it's like that microscope is if you don't have the right way you don't have the right influences you don't have the right anointing oil on the word you won't see it you won't even feel it see here brother branham he said i felt it i heard it i saw it you know how many other people in the room saw that probably none maybe somebody likelihood none because i don't see here anywhere in this quote where it says someone's shrieking in the crowd so i'm sure if me or you were in an auditorium and we saw a bat-like figure leave somebody's body we wouldn't just stand there like oh that's interesting that's right it would have an effect on you you see that is the supernatural unseen realm just like the physical unseen realm that you need something beyond your own sight something beyond your own feeling your own touch your own physical senses to be able to look at and identify so is it in the spiritual realm as it's passing through here nonstop you know the devil was the first person in church here today he comes to every function where the sons of god gather and he's one of the earliest ones there he'll beat all of us he's the first one in the door and it's easy for him because then you have to wait for any of us to unlock it for him he just he's here he's waiting he is one of the most on time people to any religious service and i know this because in the book of job it talks about and the sons of god gathered together before the throne and satan was there also he showed up yes you'd be like he got cast out of heaven what was he doing yeah before the throne of god is there to figure see what can i pick out of this what am i missing as i'm running the lord said what you've been doing he's like going to and fro throughout the earth so it's a lot of work down there because there's a lot of people and to touch all of them and make sure i'm keeping them all busy i gotta keep keep traveling keep traveling so up here to see if anyone up here will identify somebody for me that i am just missing altogether and god's like got one for you have you ever noticed my servant job saying he's like i notice him all the time the hedge of protection you got around him i can't even see what he's i can't see what he's thinking what he's doing i don't know what his next move is and so i can't i can't second-guess him and get ahead of him he's always one step ahead of me and it's all your fault and god's like yeah you know i like him he's kind of great and it was like well he's only great because of that hedge of protection you let me add him you'll see how ungreat he is that's what he was waiting for that's what he's that's why he shows up here every service and god's like hey hey buddy what you doing here he's like well i'm just looking to see if there's somebody i'm missing somebody that you're once again got a hedge of protection around that you're not letting me see into their lives and your plan for their life and they keep one step ahead of me so i'm hoping that if i get here to church and they let their guard down and maybe i'll hear something or see something that i can work with because whenever they're out there man they are on fire they are always trying to toe the line and say the right thing to the right people and and all those things but i figure church if they're going to let down their guard anywhere or get upset with someone it's probably going to be at church because they expect everyone else to be better here so now they're going to get annoyed because that brother knows better so if i can get in on that then that'll be something i can work with but he shows up he shows up he's it's very real now don't get scared though do what's even more real the power of god in this building you see because brother man i made a statement and i really am closing here 9 15 take five more minutes and we'll close um but billy random said someone with the wrong spirit sitting in the pews can influence five rows forward five rows back from where they're at think about that you come in with the wrong attitude without the spirit of worship you just all in a huff you don't like you don't like what the you don't like the preacher that's going to be preaching that day you don't like what the song leader is doing you didn't like how the deacon treated you as you came through the door fact is you're kind of upset with your wife from earlier that morning because of what she did and you've been in a huff since then because she's also supposed to be a good christian woman and she should be treating you a whole lot better and you get here with that attitude on you you thought influencing the wrong spear you thought i was talking about you know the drunk guy who comes in here and sits down nah he he's not even a problem the deacons catch him they give him a spot in the back they keep an eye on him we're not worried about him not at all we're worried about us coming in sitting here at the wrong attitude which is invite giving the devil a place in your life right then to then influence the rest of the service for everybody else but don't worry don't get scared about that either okay and this is why colossians 1 and we're going to just going to read from verse 12 through 16. or or so here i'm just going to get started and i'm going to move through it fast giving thanks unto the father which has have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light keep that in mind you're of the saints in light that's going to be important who had delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now these are all present tense things none of this is futuristic so apply it today apply it right now apply it to that attitude that's right amen all these things apply who had delivered us from the power of darkness and had translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things will be created by him and for him all a-l-l all principalities all spirits all not just good ones but the bad ones and the devil himself god created for his own purpose and for his own good keep that in mind and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning and the firstborn from the dead then all things he might have preeminence that's what it's all about if you want to be able to apply all these other things then you have to apply the part where he must have preeminence that's wife he has preeminence the holy spirit christ himself in your life all these other things fall into place now i'm going to read you one last quote remember we are partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light okay we already have seen where this young man troubled by an evil spirit had a physical manifestation right that if you're you had the right eyes to see it and the ability to feel it it was very real prophet described it not once but many times you describe these situations very real okay and i just told you how coming in with that wrong attitude that wrong spirit allowing it influence can influence i mean here if you sit in the middle of the church five rows forward and five rows back you got the whole place covered you even have part of the foyer covered maybe the bathroom but but here's the thing is i don't want to focus on that i want to focus here now okay i've shown you what the problem is now here's the resolution an expectation now if you'll notice the patient he's talking about he's once again in a prayer line just the spirit of the lord is here and the patient i don't know her she's from new york but a real strange feeling watch them and when they get about eight or ten feet you'll see the expression come up on her face now the lady i don't know her but you have an odd feeling don't you lady a very strange very odd now that the audience might know would you step a little closer to that mic isn't that the truth sister answers it's the truth a very odd strange feeling it's sacred what is it the light you see in the picture is now here at the platform the you might not be it might come clear you might see it but he's here i know it's here everything seems like to be like getting milky around over the building you see the prophet's vision the same one that saw that devil could see that light coming in standing there next to him manifesting itself that he could see the spirit of god out of the people and what he describes as a milky condition getting so thick when something's milky like if you ever drive through a milky fog you can barely see through it it's so thick it obscures your vision this is what happened in solomon's temple and the same spirit of god came down jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he's still the same today okay and that i know it's here you see the anointing is coming on now now i read this because we've seen we've identified the devil and his power or the little power he has that's given to him but now we want to identify the power that is with us because if we are this of in we have an inheritance of the saints in light it has to be that same light that led the children of israel through the wilderness it's got to be that same light that came down and spoke to paul and struck him off his horse and said paul saul saul why should thou persecute me it's got to be that same light that was here in the meetings of a brother branham that come swirling into the room and stand beside him it's that same light that created that milky presence over the people yet it wasn't just for him it wasn't just attached to an individual that same light that same presence and i go as far as to say that if you could have looked at the beginning of the service when you felt that presence come down if god would have given you that ability to see you would have seen that same milky presence all throughout this building it's the same you see people saints it's the same it's an unseen world that by which we're being affected by but we do not have to live in fear of the unseen world that is controlled by the devil anymore the disciples had to fear the principalities and powers that the devil was in control of at the time of christ because when the devil took him up on a high mountain and said look at the nations of the world they're all mine christ said yeah they're yours and yet in that knowing and admitting to the devil these nations are yours to do it as you wish he told his disciples don't worry when you go before the leaders of these nations that the devil is in control of i'll give you the right thing to say and he and they have never and will never be in control if you'll just stay surrendered to me saints that's where we're at we've entered into that spiritual realm where we're not fighting a physical foe but all we're doing is surrendering as you surrender and god steps in and takes control he'll do your fighting for you he'll use your mouth just like he used the prophet just like he uses every minister behind this pulpit just like he uses the song leader to lead in in worship when the time comes and he wants to use you to speak to somebody when the time comes and he wants to use you to perform an action you'll open your mouth and his words will pour out that's why so many times when branham would say i have to go back and listen to the tape to know what i said so is it with me and you this is not a thing that it was only for a prophet for god to come in and take control of our lives don't hesitate because you're like well i got to think about this do i have the right it was it was that in peter was that in mark what what was the reference no no no if you try and do that you're going to trip all over yourself just step right into it just like all them uneducated disciples did and you know what the people said when they spoke they said we know that they were uneducated and unlearned but from the way they spoke we knew they had been with jesus and that was the example of our prophet today is many a people many a ministries many a denominational minister said we do not agree with your teachings of the scripture but we have never met someone that so expressed the life of christ and the love of god you know why because he just surrendered he just surrendered and he knew way more than me and you musicians if you come because i'll just keep going but he knew way more than me and you there's testimony where brothers would come up to him and and give him a hug and say brother branham i love you he said i sure wish you wouldn't say that and hear why he said i wish he wouldn't say that it goes because he didn't love him back because he knew in their heart they didn't love him it was as scripture says it was vain words with your words you don't you do dust out worship me but your heart is far from me and that spirit of christ just in him said oh i wish you wouldn't say that and say that those lies because you're going to need forgiveness for that i love you don't do that all he wanted was for them to see the love of god and accept the truth that's it he didn't wish him no harm he didn't wish them to a life in hell he said if you could just see what i see [Music] he said i want all of you to make it he said if you'd be in there and seen what i've seen you'd know if if nothing else just don't miss it just don't miss it [Music] don't don't settle in on all your petty squabbles and and arguments over or little things that don't matter he said just enter into the love of god love one another and let that presence take full control [Music] brother steve could you please come close us in a word of prayer i don't i don't know how to stop [Music] this is our heads heavenly father we lord we thank you father for your word tonight father just to appreciate lord god just the lord there's so much for us and or just thinking
