[54:15] Freddy you are not stranger here though
[54:20] so praise the Lord you know some people
[54:23] like the stranger feeling so they stay
[54:25] away
[54:27] and then then when they come then we
[54:28] greet them praise the
[54:30] lord well you not
[54:33] stranger amen like like I was saying I
[54:37] was studying this morning uh uh what we
[54:39] want to talk about and then I break into
[54:42] this grace and mercy
[54:44] than and uh
[54:48] uh
[54:49] uh I break into the grace and mercy
[54:53] thing and then it kind of for
[54:57] really captur me this morning really
[54:59] spoke to me in a personal way and uh
[55:05] uh and I think
[55:08] uh you know it looks uh it's it's
[55:11] sometimes it become very common to us
[55:13] that we don't really realize uh you know
[55:17] what grace and mercy means to Us Praise
[55:21] the Lord so before we go into our
[55:23] subject this morning I just share with
[55:25] you my
[55:27] uh what was part of my morning
[55:29] meditation now so uh uh
[55:37] uh in the message the oncoming
[55:41] storm uh this this this was a quote that
[55:44] I remember many years ago there's a
[55:46] brother that was preaching for us and he
[55:48] said this I've read it saw it and never
[55:52] really uh I never got a hold of it like
[55:55] the way he said it
[55:56] but then it it kind of throw much light
[55:59] on the subject the thing surprises me is
[56:03] the grace of
[56:04] God I said I have exhausted his Mercy
[56:09] many
[56:10] times but I never can exhaust his grace
[56:16] and I'm so glad of
[56:18] that praise the Lord and the first thing
[56:21] that comes to my mind is because God's
[56:24] Mercy is renewed every every morning
[56:27] amen so definitely we all exhaust his
[56:31] mercy so he got to bring a brand new one
[56:34] every
[56:35] day praise the
[56:38] Lord uh uh the scripture said in the in
[56:43] the book of
[56:47] lamentation this I recall lamentation CH
[56:51] 3: 21 this I recall to my mind therefore
[56:57] have our
[56:59] hope it is of the Lord's
[57:03] Mercy that we are not
[57:06] consumed because his compassion fth
[57:11] not they are new every
[57:14] morning and new every morning great is
[57:18] his
[57:19] faithfulness praise the Lord amen so
[57:23] when you really look at Mercy and Grace
[57:29] they are they looks like identical
[57:34] twins but yet they have they have uh
[57:37] they have some differences
[57:39] Mercy is God not punishing
[57:43] us for our saints that we
[57:47] deserve praise the Lord amen we deserve
[57:51] to be
[57:53] punished but he's not punishing us
[57:57] amen like David said in the psalm he has
[58:00] not dealt with me according to my
[58:04] transgression praise the Lord so that's
[58:07] God's
[58:08] mercy and his
[58:12] grace is God's blessing us desper we
[58:17] don't deserve
[58:20] it amen is uh an unmerited favor so he's
[58:26] blessing us we don't deserve his
[58:28] Blessing but he's blessing us praise the
[58:31] Lord and what we deserve he's not giving
[58:35] it to
[58:37] us what we deserve for our wrong he's
[58:41] not giving it to
[58:44] us God's not giving us what our wrong
[58:49] deserve that is his Mercy but he gave us
[58:53] what we don't deserve and that's his
[58:55] grace
[58:57] Mercy is deliverance from
[59:02] judgment Grace is extending
[59:06] kindness to their
[59:09] unworthy every day we live is an act of
[59:13] God's
[59:14] mercy if he give if he give us all we
[59:19] deserve we would not live another
[59:23] day and Grace
[59:26] is anything in everything we receive by
[59:30] his
[59:31] Mercy anything in everything we receive
[59:36] by his
[59:37] Mercy praise the
[59:39] Lord then I also look into the thought
[59:42] of Sovereign
[59:45] Grace God's Sovereign Grace is to all
[59:48] mankind regardless of their spiritual
[59:53] standing praise the Lord so God is
[59:57] Sovereign in his sovereignty he give
[59:59] Grace to every one of us to give Grace
[1:00:02] to every living
[1:00:07] creature but that's different from his
[1:00:09] Saving
[1:00:10] Grace his Sovereign Grace is different
[1:00:13] from his saving grace even though in his
[1:00:16] Saving Grace there's an act of
[1:00:19] sovereignty but his Saving Grace is a
[1:00:22] special
[1:00:24] unmerited divine assistance for
[1:00:27] regeneration and
[1:00:29] sanctification the the grace that is giv
[1:00:32] us to be able to pick up ourself and say
[1:00:35] I'm going to church a Saving
[1:00:37] Grace praise the Lord because not not
[1:00:41] many can do it amen even though everyone
[1:00:45] have his Sovereign Grace life is given
[1:00:47] to them but not many make that choice of
[1:00:50] coming to the house of the Lord to
[1:00:53] appreciate him for the grace that that
[1:00:55] is given to them praise the Lord in
[1:00:59] Hebrew
[1:01:02] 4:16 Hebrews
[1:01:04] 4:16 Paul said and we want to
[1:01:10] quote then we can go into what we want
[1:01:12] to share with you this morning let us
[1:01:15] therefore come bed onto the throne of
[1:01:18] grace praise the Lord let's come boldly
[1:01:22] onto the throne of grace because we will
[1:01:24] meet God's favor there amen praise the
[1:01:27] Lord when we come boldly to the throne
[1:01:29] of grace we're surely going to meet the
[1:01:31] grace of God we're not going to meet
[1:01:33] judgment there we will meet God's favor
[1:01:36] let's let's therefore come Bolding onto
[1:01:38] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[1:01:43] mercy and find Grace to help in time of
[1:01:49] need praise the Lord so you see how
[1:01:52] grace and mercy Works hand in hand
[1:01:57] praise the
[1:01:58] Lord is by the grace of God that we are
[1:02:01] not condemned and that's Mercy because
[1:02:05] God is not dealing with us according to
[1:02:08] all we
[1:02:14] deserve praise the
[1:02:16] Lord so Mercy is
[1:02:19] God not giving you all you deserve for
[1:02:23] your wrong
[1:02:28] and his
[1:02:29] grace is desper you are wrong he still
[1:02:33] love
[1:02:34] you let's stand to our feet this
[1:02:40] morning turn to the word of
[1:02:45] God praise the Lord
[1:02:58] his grace and mercy has brought us
[1:03:01] through amen let's go to St
[1:03:05] John St John chapter
[1:03:14] 4 no that would not be St John chapter 4
[1:03:17] that should be wrong that should be
[1:03:19] Matthew chapter 4 I said in my notes in
[1:03:22] John chapter 4 that's not in John
[1:03:24] chapter 4 s John chapter 4 should be the
[1:03:28] woman at the
[1:03:29] well Matthew chapter
[1:03:33] 4 Matthew chapter 4 is Jesus Temptation
[1:03:37] in the
[1:03:44] wilderness praise the Lord Matthew
[1:03:46] chapter 4 we read from verse one then
[1:03:49] was Jesus led
[1:03:51] up led up of the spirit Into the
[1:03:54] Wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[1:03:57] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[1:04:00] night he was afterward and hungry and
[1:04:04] when the tempter came to him he said if
[1:04:08] thou be the Son of God command that
[1:04:10] these Stones be made
[1:04:13] bread and he answered and
[1:04:17] said can we read that
[1:04:19] together it is written men shall not
[1:04:23] live by bread alone
[1:04:26] but by every word that proceed out of
[1:04:29] the mouth of God
[1:04:32] Amen St John chapter
[1:04:38] 6 that's where our our inspiration is
[1:04:42] coming from this morning men shall not
[1:04:44] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:04:47] that comes from the mouth of God you go
[1:04:50] in the book of Deuteronomy you realize
[1:04:52] that Moses said that uh
[1:04:56] you read chapter 8 but we want to read
[1:05:00] uh St John chapter 6 we read this on
[1:05:04] Sunday evening uh um during the
[1:05:08] communion but we want to take it into
[1:05:11] our subject now this morning it's in
[1:05:13] John chapter 6 let's read from verse 31
[1:05:17] Our Father did eat Manor in the desert
[1:05:21] as it is written he gave them bread from
[1:05:23] Heaven to eat then said then Jesus said
[1:05:27] unto them verily verily I said unto you
[1:05:31] Moses give you not that bread from
[1:05:35] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[1:05:38] bread from heaven for the bread of God
[1:05:43] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[1:05:47] giveth life unto the
[1:05:50] word then said they unto him Lord for
[1:05:55] forever more give us this bread and
[1:05:58] Jesus said unto them I am the bread of
[1:06:01] life he that cometh to me shall never
[1:06:05] hunger and he that believeth on me shall
[1:06:09] never thirst praise the Lord let's pray

[1:07:07] that's that's just uh our little weight
[1:07:09] of uh honoring the word when we read it
[1:07:13] it's our salute to the word now now uh
[1:07:18] this morning title what I want to speak
[1:07:20] on the tree of life in plain view uh
[1:07:25] couple of weeks ago we were we were down
[1:07:27] in New Jersey uh speaking for brother
[1:07:29] Kenneth and his group there and I
[1:07:32] preaching this year uh take the book and
[1:07:35] eat it so that's what I was speaking on
[1:07:39] and then after the service uh he said uh
[1:07:42] you know closing the service he says wow
[1:07:45] you know uh uh the brother brought a
[1:07:47] treat of life in plain view so I said
[1:07:50] well that's a good title I will change
[1:07:53] my title now
[1:07:56] the treade of life in plain view so
[1:07:58] that's that's what I title what I want
[1:07:59] to speak on but it's a continuation from
[1:08:02] take the book in edat it Genesis chapter
[1:08:05] 2 if we would just we just quickly do a
[1:08:08] review here Genesis chapter 2 that was
[1:08:11] that was where uh our subject started
[1:08:14] from in verse 8 Genesis 2 verse 8
[1:08:18] and9
[1:08:20] we Genesis 2: 8 and9 and the Lord God
[1:08:26] planted a garden Eastward in Eden and
[1:08:29] there he put the man whom he had formed
[1:08:32] and out of the ground made the Lord God
[1:08:35] to grow every tree that is Pleasant to
[1:08:40] the sight and good for food and the tree
[1:08:44] of life was in the midst of the garden
[1:08:47] and the tree of knowledge good and evil
[1:08:51] now you remember that's when we were
[1:08:52] trying to uh show how the tree of
[1:08:56] knowledge over time overshadow the Tree
[1:09:00] of Life praise the Lord because what you
[1:09:03] talk about over and over it has a way of
[1:09:07] overshadowing your
[1:09:09] mind praise the Lord amen so the tree of
[1:09:13] life was in the midst in the middle of
[1:09:16] the garden and uh and and and in the
[1:09:19] midst of all the other tree now and and
[1:09:22] when we look at that word Miss also uh
[1:09:25] we we try to uh bring our thoughts to
[1:09:29] the place to understand that uh the word
[1:09:33] Miss means the
[1:09:35] middle but
[1:09:37] also something that is in the
[1:09:40] middle uh could also mean something that
[1:09:44] we all gravitate
[1:09:47] around praise the Lord
[1:09:50] amen uh uh
[1:09:53] uh if we if we if we want to take uh an
[1:09:58] example we can use uh uh a leader a CEO
[1:10:02] he's in the middle of the company
[1:10:05] because everything gravity even though
[1:10:08] he's not the one on the field but you
[1:10:10] know everything has to pass through him
[1:10:13] praise the Lord so uh uh the the the
[1:10:17] Mist the middle of uh of the Garden of
[1:10:21] Eden or the position of the treat of
[1:10:23] Life uh is uh it could be a geological
[1:10:28] position but what I want to bring out of
[1:10:31] it is in the place there it was the tree
[1:10:35] of life so it sustained everything that
[1:10:39] live in the Garden of Eden praise the
[1:10:41] Lord everything in the Garden of Eden
[1:10:45] survived on the tree of life so the tree
[1:10:49] of life being in the
[1:10:51] midst amen Jesus is in our mid he's in
[1:10:56] the middle of our life he's the center
[1:10:59] of our joy like we sing he's the center
[1:11:02] of our joy is it means that everything
[1:11:06] that bring joyness and gladness and
[1:11:09] everything about our life rotates around
[1:11:13] him are we together that's where we want
[1:11:16] to go with this talk this
[1:11:19] morning now so we look at there together
[1:11:22] the treat of life in the midst of the
[1:11:25] guing and the treat of knowledge and
[1:11:26] good and evil was also there praise the
[1:11:29] Lord and then we look at verse 16 and 17
[1:11:33] uh um in the same chapter 26- 17 the
[1:11:38] Lord God
[1:11:39] commanded the man saying of every tree
[1:11:43] listen to this now this is the first
[1:11:45] commandment that was ever given to Men
[1:11:48] of every
[1:11:49] tree of the garden thou May freely eat
[1:11:54] but of the treat of the
[1:11:57] knowledge of Good and Evil thou sh shall
[1:11:59] not eat for in the day that thou eateth
[1:12:04] thereof thou shall surely die praise the
[1:12:08] Lord I Hope You Hear the Commandment
[1:12:10] clearly amen then we go to Genesis
[1:12:13] chapter 3 verse uh uh uh we go uh uh
[1:12:18] chapter 3 verse one let's let's take
[1:12:21] verse
[1:12:23] one now the serpent was more subti than
[1:12:26] any beast of the field which the Lord
[1:12:29] has made and he said unto the woman yeah
[1:12:31] have God said ye shall not eat of every
[1:12:34] tree in the
[1:12:36] garden and the woman said unto the
[1:12:38] serpent we may eat of the the the fruit
[1:12:42] of the tree of the garden but of the
[1:12:46] fruit of the tree in the midst of the
[1:12:50] garden now that's where that's where we
[1:12:53] were trying to get the focus that's word
[1:12:55] everything is misplaced here because the
[1:12:58] tree that was in the midst of the garden
[1:13:00] was the tree of
[1:13:02] life amen the tree that God told them
[1:13:05] not to eat us was the tree of knowledge
[1:13:08] good and evil it was not what was
[1:13:11] identify as being in the midst praise
[1:13:14] the Lord but yeah yeah Eve is saying we
[1:13:18] can eat of every tree but the tree that
[1:13:20] is in the
[1:13:23] midst he said we should not
[1:13:26] eat so the the the the the thought year
[1:13:31] is there the uh uh over and over the the
[1:13:36] the the devil has been able to to to to
[1:13:40] move the tree of knowledge in the
[1:13:47] middle praise the
[1:13:49] Lord amen it's it's almost like the way
[1:13:53] the devil does it with you know there
[1:13:55] are a lot of things that is going on in
[1:13:56] our life and and we wake up in the
[1:13:58] morning and you I mean we have all but
[1:14:01] if there is a major problem if there is
[1:14:03] a take for example what he like to use
[1:14:06] an illness if there is a sickness in a
[1:14:09] family it becomes the major
[1:14:14] talk we talk about the prescription we
[1:14:17] talk about the doct of visit we talk
[1:14:19] about oh I I also read this I heard the
[1:14:22] news about and that's what we talk what
[1:14:24] what he doing is that he brings that
[1:14:27] little problem and he overshadow every
[1:14:30] other thing in the house that's the only
[1:14:32] thing we talk
[1:14:34] about it does not means that you know uh
[1:14:39] uh we all going to die
[1:14:41] tomorrow it does not means that I mean
[1:14:45] nothing good else is
[1:14:47] happening but Satan has a word
[1:14:50] of bringing the ugly thing and he
[1:14:53] Amplified and he spread it out and and
[1:14:56] now that's the only thing we talk about
[1:14:58] that's the only thing that is taking our
[1:15:06] energy and we realize that that's what
[1:15:09] he did
[1:15:10] here because the word of God is clear is
[1:15:14] written right
[1:15:16] there he says every fruit that is
[1:15:18] Pleasant thou might eat it talks about a
[1:15:21] treat of life in the mid in the middle
[1:15:26] verse 16 and 17 and he then he gives
[1:15:29] them the Commandment don't eat of the
[1:15:30] tree of knowledge good and
[1:15:37] evil now here in in chapter three we
[1:15:40] realize there the when when he confront
[1:15:43] the woman and and the way that he throw
[1:15:46] the question on the woman he he knows
[1:15:49] how our mind
[1:15:50] runs praise the Lord he knows how our
[1:15:54] mind
[1:15:57] runs and if he want to set upset you he
[1:16:01] knows exactly what to
[1:16:04] do praise the Lord he knows exactly what
[1:16:08] to do to give you a miserable
[1:16:14] day well that's that's that's the person
[1:16:16] he
[1:16:18] is okay that's the person he is I mean
[1:16:21] he's he's not having no good plan for
[1:16:23] nobody
[1:16:26] praise the Lord amen you ever look in
[1:16:29] his
[1:16:31] bag saw him carrying any good thing even
[1:16:35] the ones that look good it's just a
[1:16:37] tribe to make you
[1:16:43] miserable praise the Lord so we so we
[1:16:46] came traveling down that road now where
[1:16:50] we want to go uh uh today is there
[1:16:56] uh
[1:16:57] uh he got them to eat he he overshadowed
[1:17:01] the treat of life and now cut uh Eve in
[1:17:05] this thought process that uh uh we may
[1:17:08] eat of every treat in the garden but of
[1:17:11] the fruit of the of the tree which is in
[1:17:14] in the midst of the garden God have said
[1:17:17] ye shall not eat it neither shall you
[1:17:19] touch it least you die he he have
[1:17:21] already got in E praise the Lord
[1:17:25] amen if you take the word of God from
[1:17:28] your life the devil has got
[1:17:30] you praise the Lord that I mean that's
[1:17:33] that just what it is no matter how how
[1:17:36] smart how educated you are take the word
[1:17:38] of God for your life that's what Jesus
[1:17:40] said men shall
[1:17:42] live not by bread alone but by every
[1:17:45] word that proceed from the mouth of
[1:17:48] God that's what we want to talk about
[1:17:51] this
[1:17:52] morning so he has already got there them
[1:17:55] to the place and and and I mean there
[1:17:57] was he has he he has taken her defense
[1:18:00] you know he have taken her protection
[1:18:03] away so yeah she's
[1:18:05] vulnerable because now she can see the
[1:18:08] treat of
[1:18:10] life and this treat of knowledge good of
[1:18:13] evil God said the day you eat of it that
[1:18:15] day you will die so that was the treat
[1:18:17] of death now so uh uh and and the four
[1:18:23] came and the B will tell us let's go to
[1:18:26] in chapter 3 and uh uh the last two
[1:18:30] verse in chapter
[1:18:37] 3 verse 23 the Bible says therefore the
[1:18:41] Lord God sent him sent man Adam forth
[1:18:44] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[1:18:46] ground from when he was
[1:18:48] taken so he drove out the
[1:18:53] man and he placed at the east of the
[1:18:57] Garden of Eden
[1:18:59] cherubin praise the
[1:19:02] Lord and a flaming SWR which turned
[1:19:06] every way to keep the weight of the
[1:19:09] treat of life now
[1:19:12] that the tree of life was overshadowed
[1:19:17] God now put cherubins to be able to
[1:19:20] guide the Tree of Life praise the Lord
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:25] the Bible says they were placed there to
[1:19:27] keep the way of the treat of life to be
[1:19:30] able to guide to become a protector now
[1:19:33] because now the the the devil now has uh
[1:19:36] has uh has overshadowed the treat of
[1:19:38] life he has he has uh uh uh put this
[1:19:41] tree of knowledge on the minds of Adam
[1:19:44] and his wife and and not too too long
[1:19:47] they will see King killing Abel death
[1:19:50] would now starts to enter in the family
[1:19:53] death would now starts to enter into the
[1:19:55] hemay and things will just go on from
[1:19:58] there to where we are
[1:20:01] but with the treat of Life the treat of
[1:20:04] life is our
[1:20:05] Focus amen the treat of life because
[1:20:09] what it is in the center it must be in
[1:20:12] the center of our home the Tree of Life
[1:20:15] must be in the center of our family it
[1:20:18] must be in the center of this church
[1:20:20] amen praise the lord we must keep the
[1:20:23] treat of life in the Center meaning that
[1:20:26] everything we do must revolve around the
[1:20:28] tree of life if we want to
[1:20:34] live are we together so our focus is the
[1:20:37] treat of life and yeah we see the treat
[1:20:40] of life now is now
[1:20:43] protected with
[1:20:45] cherubins protected with angels that
[1:20:48] have flaming
[1:20:50] swore praise the
[1:20:52] Lord at one time it was there it was it
[1:20:56] was h h h accessible to us Adam could
[1:21:00] run to the tree of life you see that's
[1:21:03] the reason why he was not experiencing
[1:21:06] hunger sickness nothing because he was
[1:21:09] feeding from the treat of Life the treat
[1:21:11] of life was was uh I mean he was he was
[1:21:15] running everything through the treat of
[1:21:18] Life are we
[1:21:22] together praise the Lord
[1:21:27] now the treat of life is
[1:21:30] protected they are cherubin with flaming
[1:21:34] sword turning every way to keep the
[1:21:36] weight of the treat of
[1:21:38] life that man would not bring his sinful
[1:21:42] hands he will not just jump from the bed
[1:21:44] of sin and jump to the Tree of Life
[1:21:48] praise the Lord
[1:21:53] amen God is now requiring him to come
[1:21:56] through the bleeding skin because God
[1:21:59] provided a bleeding skin for Adam and
[1:22:02] his and and his wife God is now
[1:22:05] requiring him to come through some kind
[1:22:07] of atonement he cannot just jump from
[1:22:10] the bed of sin right into the
[1:22:15] church and that's the thing that is
[1:22:17] happening in our our our our
[1:22:21] generation Merced has been abused the
[1:22:24] grace of God is made a
[1:22:27] disgrace where we think the grace of God
[1:22:29] is just enough for us to run right from
[1:22:33] the bed of sin into the presence of
[1:22:36] God we are tramping over the
[1:22:40] blood that atone for
[1:22:42] us are we together so we see
[1:22:47] here because God will not allow him to
[1:22:50] do that so he put a cherub in there now
[1:22:53] with flaming sword to protect the treat
[1:22:55] of
[1:23:00] life we never needed to send a prayer
[1:23:03] request for for illnesses in our body
[1:23:06] but we have to now send prayer request
[1:23:08] we have to pray father please touch our
[1:23:10] brother father please heal our sister
[1:23:13] why because there's a there's a cherubin
[1:23:16] there with flaming
[1:23:19] sword are we are we together
[1:23:24] amen so so we we we like I said the
[1:23:28] treat of life is our Focus because we we
[1:23:32] realize that Jesus here is talking about
[1:23:35] the bread of life he is the bread of
[1:23:37] life then that bread must come from the
[1:23:38] treat of life so the treat of life is
[1:23:41] our
[1:23:42] focus and that's where we want to look
[1:23:45] to
[1:23:46] now now so this treat of
[1:23:50] life you will realize how over the the
[1:23:54] ages as You Follow the the the
[1:23:57] progression of the word of God and you
[1:24:00] follow the things that God is doing you
[1:24:03] will realize that uh uh this tree of
[1:24:07] life was a spiritual treat and it it
[1:24:10] starts to take a you know it starts to
[1:24:13] take a spiritual form as the ages went
[1:24:16] back I will explain that as as we go
[1:24:21] ahead praise the Lord
[1:24:27] amen now to be able to bring
[1:24:31] this to be able to bring
[1:24:36] this you will realize
[1:24:41] there the Bible speaks about the the the
[1:24:44] treat of life being protected by
[1:24:47] cherubin we will not hear about cherubin
[1:24:51] again until Moses we go on top of the
[1:24:56] mountain and uh uh uh and God was Will
[1:25:00] instruct him to build a
[1:25:04] tabernacle praise the Lord amen and then
[1:25:08] when Moses will come down to build the
[1:25:11] Tabernacle he will build the the Ark of
[1:25:15] the Covenant and uh
[1:25:19] uh come on Emmanuel
[1:25:26] go in office right under the light you
[1:25:29] will see a
[1:25:37] small
[1:25:40] now uh God will instruct Moses to
[1:25:45] build the Ark of the
[1:25:49] Covenant and on top of the Ark of the
[1:25:51] Covenant God would tell Moses to build
[1:25:55] the very same God that told Moses not to
[1:25:59] build no graving image he was not to
[1:26:03] build an image of anything but here is
[1:26:07] God will instruct Moses to build an
[1:26:09] image of two
[1:26:12] cherubin and they should be made of
[1:26:16] gold and they must be set right on top
[1:26:20] of the Ark of the
[1:26:23] Covenant praise the Lord now when you
[1:26:25] really look at this thank you I have a
[1:26:28] small one
[1:26:29] here when you really look at
[1:26:34] this if the Lord help us it would be
[1:26:36] very beautiful this this is the Arc of
[1:26:39] the Covenant is the is the whole is the
[1:26:42] whole thinking that that uh uh you know
[1:26:45] someone made just in type of what Moses
[1:26:48] was instructed to
[1:26:49] me and uh uh the act of the Covenant
[1:26:58] was made of two
[1:27:02] parts in a general sense it's called the
[1:27:05] act of the
[1:27:07] Covenant but the
[1:27:09] cover is called The Mercy
[1:27:14] Seat now so The Mercy Seat is right here
[1:27:17] this is The Mercy Seat this middle right
[1:27:20] here in
[1:27:22] here that's the mercy
[1:27:24] seat so in the way that is made is that
[1:27:29] the Angels the angels as as the Flop
[1:27:33] their wings like this these two Wings
[1:27:36] touch so it makes an entrance there so
[1:27:41] this place is The Mercy Seat so we have
[1:27:44] the Ark of the
[1:27:47] Covenant praise the lord we have the AR
[1:27:50] of the
[1:27:51] Covenant and then we we have The Mercy
[1:27:57] Seat sometimes and many times we take
[1:28:01] all to be the
[1:28:04] same praise the
[1:28:06] Lord but they all have their
[1:28:09] road if we have uh if the Lord bless our
[1:28:13] talk this morning we look into it
[1:28:16] so now upon this act of the
[1:28:20] Covenant that's when God would tell
[1:28:23] Moses
[1:28:24] to build two
[1:28:28] angels because remember now he's
[1:28:30] building the Tabernacle according to
[1:28:32] what God show him on the mountain that's
[1:28:35] the reason why he had the 40 days there
[1:28:38] so Moses would come down and instruct
[1:28:41] the children of Israel to build
[1:28:44] everything build the Ark of the Covenant
[1:28:46] and build two cherup and set
[1:28:50] it on the Ark of the Covenant
[1:28:55] now that's
[1:28:57] when cherubin will
[1:29:01] return so it gives us an idea that
[1:29:06] cherubin that were protecting the tree
[1:29:09] of
[1:29:09] life has now moved to protect because in
[1:29:14] the Ark of the Covenant was where the
[1:29:17] Ten Commandments were
[1:29:19] kept are we together amen so
[1:29:24] the the the treat of life was to give
[1:29:28] life to them just like how the
[1:29:31] Commandments of God is to give life to
[1:29:36] us are we
[1:29:38] together praise the
[1:29:40] Lord amen so so what what are we what
[1:29:44] are we saying what where are we going
[1:29:46] the tree of life has
[1:29:49] progress it's no
[1:29:52] longer a natural ual
[1:29:56] tree for the father it was a spiritual
[1:29:59] tree are we
[1:30:02] together and now we seeing that God is
[1:30:05] instructing his
[1:30:07] Prophet the same thing he did in Eden
[1:30:11] he's instructing his Prophet to do the
[1:30:15] same take two
[1:30:19] cherubin building on the lead of the of
[1:30:22] the of the Arc of the Covenant
[1:30:24] and it it should cover which mean you
[1:30:27] will have to pass the the cherubin to
[1:30:29] get to the
[1:30:31] Commandments just like you have to pass
[1:30:34] the cherubin to get to the Tree of
[1:30:39] Life are we
[1:30:41] together
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:46] so it's it's
[1:30:48] beautiful it's beautiful as the Lord
[1:30:50] will will help us to see
[1:30:55] as the Lord will help us to see
[1:30:59] it because when you look in the you look
[1:31:02] in the
[1:31:03] scripture oh God help me this
[1:31:06] morning amen you know as I as I was as I
[1:31:10] was looking at this and studying
[1:31:12] yesterday that I just it it just it was
[1:31:15] just so beautiful to me that God put
[1:31:18] Mercy above his
[1:31:20] word this is The Mercy Seat
[1:31:24] Mercy is above the
[1:31:27] Lord he Mercy endure
[1:31:31] forever we don't know what we
[1:31:35] have we really don't know God's mercy we
[1:31:39] abuse it we really don't know what we
[1:31:44] have he put Mercy above his
[1:31:50] Lord like brother Braham says he says
[1:31:53] God
[1:31:55] he will put barale before the
[1:31:58] sinner to stop him but the nature of
[1:32:02] seeing a man what makes him to jump over
[1:32:04] it go under it run around
[1:32:12] it are we
[1:32:16] together he put Merced above the Lord
[1:32:20] It's A Beautiful
[1:32:21] Thing Paul quoted Moses in Romans 9:15
[1:32:25] he says I will have mercy on whom I will
[1:32:29] have
[1:32:31] mercy praise the Lord
[1:32:35] amen I will have mercy you just think
[1:32:37] about it this the this this this very
[1:32:40] thought this was God talking to Moses
[1:32:43] traveling with those stubborn people in
[1:32:47] the wilderness with all the trouble they
[1:32:49] were giving
[1:32:51] him praise the Lord
[1:32:55] one time God says I will WEP then Moses
[1:32:57] says no Lord don't do it praise the Lord
[1:33:01] he came back and said God I think you
[1:33:02] should do it now God said no you say I
[1:33:04] shouldn't do
[1:33:06] it praise the Lord that's that just how
[1:33:10] much trouble we give the
[1:33:12] Lord
[1:33:15] amen Paul quoted Moses I will have mercy
[1:33:18] on whom I will have mercy the I can the
[1:33:21] mercy seed are two separate things in
[1:33:25] scripture I want for us to look at that
[1:33:27] a little bit because it will bring it
[1:33:29] bring a it bring a whole lot of light to
[1:33:31] our subject as we go into it the AR and
[1:33:35] the mercy seed are two separate things
[1:33:37] the holiest of hly was was defined by
[1:33:41] the presence of The Mercy
[1:33:45] Seat praise the
[1:33:47] Lord
[1:33:49] amen the holiest of Hol was defined by
[1:33:53] the presence of The Mercy
[1:33:57] Seat let's look at Numbers Chapter
[1:34:00] 7 let's do a quick
[1:34:03] uh
[1:34:06] uh let's do a quick scripture run here
[1:34:09] and see if
[1:34:12] uh we can be able to get through it
[1:34:14] Numbers Chapter 7
[1:34:25] Numbers chapter 7: 89 and Moses and when
[1:34:30] Moses was gone into the Tabernacle of
[1:34:33] the congregation to speak with him then
[1:34:36] he heard a voice of one Speaking unto
[1:34:40] him from off the mercy
[1:34:44] seat that was upon the AR of the
[1:34:49] testimony when he heard the voice it was
[1:34:53] not coming from in the ark the voice was
[1:34:57] coming
[1:34:58] from
[1:35:00] where it was coming from The Mercy
[1:35:05] Seat praise the
[1:35:07] Lord it was coming from The Mercy
[1:35:17] Seat he heard a voice speaking unto him
[1:35:20] from all the mercy seat that was upon
[1:35:23] the ey of the
[1:35:25] testimony from between the two
[1:35:28] cherubin and he speak unto him amen are
[1:35:33] we
[1:35:34] together let's look at 1 Chronicles
[1:35:38] chapter
[1:35:39] 28 1 Chronicles chapter
[1:35:46] 28 praise the Lord 1 Chronicle
[1:35:51] 28 11

[1:36:08] treasury thereof and of the upper
[1:36:10] chamber thereof and of the Ender P
[1:36:14] thereof and of the place of The Mercy
[1:36:18] Seat praise the
[1:36:21] Lord uh can I remember why I pull this
[1:36:27] here okay that's one of them if it comes
[1:36:30] to my mind I will I will I will fall
[1:36:33] back to that uh uh Leviticus chapter 16
[1:36:39] Leviticus 16 verse1
[1:36:41] 15 Leviticus 16 verse1 15 if I remember
[1:36:45] why I put that there I will come back to
[1:36:50] it then shall he kill the goat of of the
[1:36:53] sin offering that is for the people and
[1:36:56] bring his blood within the veil and do
[1:36:59] with the blood as he did with the blood
[1:37:02] of the bulock
[1:37:05] amen and sprinkle it upon the mercy
[1:37:09] seat and before the mercy
[1:37:14] seat praise the
[1:37:16] Lord but you have to remember now The
[1:37:19] Mercy Seat is sitting on the Ark of the
[1:37:22] Covenant but God is being
[1:37:27] precise he's being precise and there is
[1:37:31] a
[1:37:36] reason are we
[1:37:38] together praise the
[1:37:41] Lord sprinkle The Blood On The Mercy
[1:37:44] Seat and before the mercy
[1:37:49] seat let me leave it there and uh we
[1:37:53] will we will let's let's also look at U
[1:37:57] having another another uh verse here
[1:38:00] Ezekiel chapter 43 Ezekiel
[1:38:04] 43 then we will look at something in uh
[1:38:07] in in uh Jeremiah but Ezekiel
[1:38:12] 43 the prophet
[1:38:16] Ezekiel Ezekiel 43: 6
[1:38:32] okay I know where I know why I put this
[1:38:34] here I know what I put this here okay
[1:38:38] let's let's just look at
[1:38:40] Jeremiah this will take take me take us
[1:38:42] through another long route but let's
[1:38:45] look at Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 16
[1:38:48] Ezekiel will take us
[1:38:54] he's a prophet after the Aire he will
[1:38:57] take us back to the
[1:38:59] asire so let's just look at
[1:39:02] Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter
[1:39:05] 3 Jeremiah chapter 3: 16 okay they have
[1:39:09] it up there and it shall come to pass
[1:39:12] when ye be multiply and increase in the
[1:39:16] land in those days thus sayth the
[1:39:21] Lord they shall say no more the Ark of
[1:39:25] the Covenant of the Lord neither shall
[1:39:29] it come to mind neither shall they
[1:39:32] remember it neither shall they visit it
[1:39:37] neither shall that be done anymore let's
[1:39:42] read the next
[1:39:47] verse at that time they shall call
[1:39:50] Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord now now
[1:39:53] you can look at this prophecy in two
[1:39:56] different ways but Jeremiah is talking
[1:39:58] about a period of time where the ACT
[1:40:01] will not be mentioned
[1:40:03] anymore amen but there will not be a
[1:40:07] time where The Mercy Seat will not be
[1:40:12] mentioned are we
[1:40:14] together are you see in the picture his
[1:40:17] mentioning of a
[1:40:19] time where the ACT will not be mentioned
[1:40:23] praise the
[1:40:25] Lord but there will not be a time
[1:40:29] where we will not meas The Mercy
[1:40:33] Seat are we together so that's that was
[1:40:36] what I wanted to grab your mind on now
[1:40:39] so when you when when you look at all of
[1:40:41] that you
[1:40:43] realize that uh it is the mercy of
[1:40:50] God that is keeping us here
[1:40:53] praise the Lord amen is the mercy of
[1:40:59] God God in his
[1:41:02] mercy so you see the uh uh you know when
[1:41:06] you when you when you really look at
[1:41:09] that and you you think
[1:41:12] about
[1:41:14] the the TR of of of uh of of Mercy
[1:41:19] message in the in the Revelation series
[1:41:22] you know talking about The Mercy Seat
[1:41:24] changing position and now The Mercy Seat
[1:41:27] one time was in a man the Lord Jesus you
[1:41:31] know he was the one that blind bimus
[1:41:34] cried and Son of David have mercy on me
[1:41:36] and now The Mercy Seat you know through
[1:41:40] the the atonement is now in the house of
[1:41:43] the believer and you realize uh you know
[1:41:46] what what uh you know uh uh a
[1:41:50] responsibility you know what a responsib
[1:41:53] ibility you know that that we have I
[1:41:56] won't go in that direction this morning
[1:41:58] but it is just to be able to grab our
[1:42:01] mind because like I said the cherubin is
[1:42:04] our Focus the treat of life is our Focus
[1:42:07] praise the Lord okay so the treat of
[1:42:11] life that was protected by cherubin now
[1:42:14] under Moses dispensation is now
[1:42:17] protected by cherubin but it's now on
[1:42:20] the uh uh two tablet of
[1:42:24] Stones
[1:42:26] amen and he was the one that that that
[1:42:29] that said that in uh Deuteronomy chapter
[1:42:32] 8 men shall not live by bread alone but
[1:42:35] by every word that proceed out of the
[1:42:37] mouth of
[1:42:40] God so the word of God is all is is
[1:42:44] always
[1:42:46] protected
[1:42:49] amen the cherubin are there to protect
[1:42:52] the word
[1:42:56] and that's the reason why God raised up
[1:42:57] men in the ages to be able to protect
[1:43:00] his word amen to carry on his word now
[1:43:05] so if you look also you will see there
[1:43:08] this is what I want to get to if you
[1:43:10] look also you will see that in Isaiah
[1:43:13] Ezekiel and
[1:43:15] Revelation the the the cherubin took on
[1:43:20] identity amen the Cherub being they took
[1:43:23] on identity they were identified as a
[1:43:26] lion as a ox as a man and as an
[1:43:31] eagle the chuban took on the face of
[1:43:35] this creature let's look at Ezekiel
[1:43:37] chapter 1 verse
[1:43:40] 10 let's look at Ezekiel chapter 1 verse
[1:43:43] 10
[1:43:53] yeah Ezekiel 1 ver that's what I
[1:43:59] said Ezekiel chapter 1 verse
[1:44:07] 10 praise the
[1:44:12] Lord am I making you
[1:44:15] sleepy
[1:44:18] okay now he talks about the chuban year
[1:44:21] when you read you you will see him
[1:44:23] talking about the CH but let's let's
[1:44:25] look at verse 10 as for the likeness of
[1:44:28] their
[1:44:31] faces therefore have the face of a
[1:44:36] man and the face of a
[1:44:39] lion on the right
[1:44:42] side and they for her the face of an
[1:44:47] ox on the left side and they and and uh
[1:44:52] and and uh no therefore also had the
[1:44:56] face of an eagle now it talks about the
[1:45:00] left side the right side so the first
[1:45:04] phase was the front side and the back
[1:45:07] side praise the Lord when you read this
[1:45:11] it's easy to think
[1:45:13] that each one of them have four faces
[1:45:18] no I think we we kind of uh demonstrated
[1:45:21] the idea the last time
[1:45:23] with with four of the
[1:45:25] brothers now so if it is the face of a
[1:45:29] man they all take that
[1:45:33] identity so when they move they are now
[1:45:35] moving in separate Direction they all
[1:45:38] move together praise the Lord amen they
[1:45:43] all move together if it's the face of
[1:45:45] the man they all take the face of the
[1:45:48] man all the strength of the Beast get
[1:45:50] behind there and defend the church or
[1:45:53] defend the act of the Covenant if they
[1:45:55] are going this way and they take the
[1:45:58] face of an ego every one of them is
[1:46:00] identified with that Faith so they don't
[1:46:02] it's not that one have full face
[1:46:05] no they don't go in separate ways they
[1:46:08] move in One
[1:46:11] Direction and when they are moving
[1:46:13] whatever identity is there if it is the
[1:46:15] lion they will all be honor that
[1:46:19] anointing of the
[1:46:21] lion I we
[1:46:25] together is the picture out praise the
[1:46:28] Lord if it's not clear to you you tell
[1:46:31] us we will develop it
[1:46:33] more we will develop it we can show more
[1:46:36] light on it now the reason why I'm
[1:46:38] bringing this is there you look in
[1:46:41] Ezekiel chapter 10:14 you will see more
[1:46:43] identification of that Revelation 4:7
[1:46:46] gave us more identification of that now
[1:46:49] these are the very same cherubin that
[1:46:51] was in the of Eden praise the Lord these
[1:46:56] are the very same cherubin that God told
[1:47:00] Moses to put on the Ark of the
[1:47:04] Covenant but here it was in an image
[1:47:09] form praise the Lord amen
[1:47:13] but which mean the presence of the of
[1:47:17] the of the cherubin was
[1:47:19] symbolic by this gold image but the
[1:47:23] presence was there are we
[1:47:26] together and here and here Ezekiel is
[1:47:29] seeing the same thing uh asaiah saw the
[1:47:32] same thing after Urias died when he went
[1:47:35] into the temple he saw the chuban they
[1:47:37] were moving so fast and he says their
[1:47:41] train filled the temple while their
[1:47:43] wings were so locked together that they
[1:47:46] were moving in such a speed that he he
[1:47:49] he took it as a train just like the
[1:47:51] train bucket is join one to one to
[1:47:53] another and is moving their speed that
[1:47:56] was how Isaiah saw it when he said their
[1:47:59] train filled the temple it was the same
[1:48:02] cherubin with their wings all locked
[1:48:06] together are we together Ezekiel Saw the
[1:48:10] same thing John saw the same thing over
[1:48:13] in the Book of
[1:48:16] Revelation praise the Lord now so the
[1:48:19] cherubin as much as they are there to
[1:48:23] guide us back to the Tree of Life the
[1:48:26] the their position is the a person that
[1:48:30] is guiding you is also influencing you
[1:48:35] amen their position is a position of
[1:48:41] influence they are there to influence us
[1:48:45] are we
[1:48:47] together
[1:48:50] amen so you will realize there is a lot
[1:48:53] of
[1:48:55] responsibility upon the
[1:48:58] ministry because the ministry is playing
[1:49:02] their role in a little
[1:49:04] sense our position is to guide you to
[1:49:08] the treat of
[1:49:09] Life praise the Lord
[1:49:13] amen and that's the reason why uh uh can
[1:49:17] you imagine that God will give a man a
[1:49:20] burden and and and uh you know it was it
[1:49:23] will I mean uh uh uh he wake up and
[1:49:26] everything he does is he he he just he
[1:49:29] just have the people on his
[1:49:33] mind praise the
[1:49:36] lord it's a blessing to have somebody
[1:49:39] that will pray for you
[1:49:41] amen somebody that can be able to be
[1:49:43] there to listen if you want to talk
[1:49:46] praise the Lord
[1:49:53] but that's the way it is praise the Lord
[1:49:57] I don't want to lose my trend of thought
[1:49:59] here now
[1:50:01] so remember now the the the the the Adam
[1:50:06] and Eve were supposed to eat of the
[1:50:08] treat of life amen it was in the middle
[1:50:10] of the guiding now the the the cherubin
[1:50:13] are there to guide him back to do that
[1:50:15] same thing and now these cherubin now
[1:50:18] are taking on identity under which they
[1:50:21] are going to in influence the people
[1:50:24] back into the presence of God
[1:50:27] hallelujah now of all of these all of
[1:50:30] all of these uh cherubin if you look at
[1:50:33] them the the man the ox The Lion and the
[1:50:37] eagle if you look at their
[1:50:41] natural eating habits if you look at
[1:50:45] their natural
[1:50:46] eating uh H how can I call it the way
[1:50:49] they were brought
[1:50:50] up you will realize realized that all of
[1:50:55] the three
[1:50:57] beasts fill their youngs with
[1:51:01] milk beside the
[1:51:07] eagle are we together now remember now
[1:51:11] the reason why I'm saying that I want
[1:51:12] you to keep our thought they are
[1:51:14] supposed to guide us they are supposed
[1:51:16] to influence
[1:51:18] us so our we been influenced back to to
[1:51:22] the treat of
[1:51:26] life if we are following the influence
[1:51:30] of this living creature we will realize
[1:51:33] that from the beginning when they get
[1:51:36] our
[1:51:37] attraction when the birth
[1:51:40] comes the first thing that we are fed on
[1:51:43] is
[1:51:46] milk are we
[1:51:50] together praise the Lord
[1:51:53] the first thing we are fair on is milk
[1:51:57] so you will see uh uh man as himon when
[1:52:00] we give birth our babies Fe on milk the
[1:52:04] oics feel their youngs on milk the lion
[1:52:07] feel also they are they are young on
[1:52:10] milk only the
[1:52:13] eagle that feel fees is Young on the
[1:52:17] fresh kale
[1:52:22] the ego feel is Young on a fresh kale so
[1:52:26] you will see that these things they
[1:52:28] influence us in our own spiritual work
[1:52:32] is also an influence on the
[1:52:35] age praise the
[1:52:37] Lord the first three age was on uh uh
[1:52:42] the Lion's anointing so you could see
[1:52:44] how the disciples they were trying to
[1:52:47] feed these people about the message of
[1:52:49] the Resurrection you know and and and
[1:52:52] Paul was trying to carry the gospel they
[1:52:55] were bringing but then even in that you
[1:52:58] will realize at a place where Paul keep
[1:53:00] telling these people you need to grow up
[1:53:02] we can't keep feeding you on
[1:53:06] milk praise the
[1:53:10] Lord amen we can't keep feeding you on
[1:53:14] milk we will see it in the scripture
[1:53:16] here I mean he cried to the Church of
[1:53:19] Corinthian the same thing he said it to
[1:53:21] the Hebrews the same think even Peter
[1:53:24] said it to his to his
[1:53:29] congregation are we
[1:53:33] together now remember now we talking
[1:53:35] about feeding on the Tree of
[1:53:39] Life feeding on the Tree of Life men
[1:53:42] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:53:44] every word that proceed out of the mouth
[1:53:46] of
[1:53:47] God we're trying to get to a place yet
[1:53:50] are we together
[1:53:56] amen praise the Lord you love the
[1:53:59] Lord
[1:54:02] amen let's look at 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:54:09] 2 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:54:13] 2 verse
[1:54:19] three praise the Lord
[1:54:23] you see I like to I like to look look
[1:54:25] for these things because sometimes I'm
[1:54:28] writing something completely
[1:54:34] different praise the
[1:54:36] Lord 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[1:54:54] praise the
[1:54:55] Lord
[1:54:59] hallelujah we want to get to a place
[1:55:01] here and uh I'm
[1:55:07] sure sorry and I knew that I messed that
[1:55:11] up chapter 3 verse two chapter 3 verse
[1:55:17] two so it's chapter 3:2 that's in
[1:55:21] chapter 3 that's where Paul is you know
[1:55:23] rebuking the the the Corinthian Church
[1:55:26] and saying uh you know one person
[1:55:29] baptized one person plan you know one is
[1:55:31] saying I'm for Apollo one is saying I'm
[1:55:34] for this and and all of that you know so
[1:55:37] he's here verse one he says uh and our
[1:55:41] Brethren could not speak unto you as a
[1:55:45] spiritual as uh uh as unto spiritual but
[1:55:49] as unto
[1:55:50] kind even as onto BS
[1:55:56] in Christ praise the Lord are we
[1:56:00] together
[1:56:05] amen I have fed you with milk and not
[1:56:08] with meat for Heather told you were not
[1:56:11] able to bed it neither yet now I ye able
[1:56:18] look at this verse also that Jesus said
[1:56:21] here to his disciples in John chapter
[1:56:29] 16:12 St John chapter
[1:56:38] 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto
[1:56:41] you but ye cannot bear it that's that's
[1:56:43] the same thing that Paul is telling
[1:56:45] these
[1:56:46] people it looks like we just going in
[1:56:49] cycle you see and and that's how
[1:56:52] cut and evil movement I
[1:56:56] made praise the
[1:56:58] lord we just come together and recite
[1:57:01] the
[1:57:02] things you know to to to pledge our
[1:57:08] Allegiance praise the Lord you got to
[1:57:10] say it fast we need to say it
[1:57:14] fast as soon it's done as soon as you
[1:57:16] can catch up with that you part of the
[1:57:18] group that's how C is built
[1:57:25] praise the Lord but we are serving a
[1:57:28] living
[1:57:29] God and he want to be among living
[1:57:33] people and with living
[1:57:36] people there is
[1:57:39] growth praise the
[1:57:42] Lord there is
[1:57:46] growth are we
[1:57:50] together so Jesus said says you know
[1:57:52] there that there there there there a lot
[1:57:54] I could say it unto you but you cannot
[1:57:56] bear it verse 13 He says uh uh how be it
[1:58:01] when he the spirit of Truth is come he
[1:58:04] will guide you is it not the work that
[1:58:06] the cherubin was
[1:58:08] doing he will guide
[1:58:12] you so we see another progression of the
[1:58:15] cherubin he will guide you into all
[1:58:19] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[1:58:22] self but whatsoever he shall hear that
[1:58:25] he shall speak and he will show you
[1:58:28] things to
[1:58:31] come he will show you things to
[1:58:36] come praise the
[1:58:40] Lord Hebrews chapter 5 I know I'm doing
[1:58:43] a lot of Bible reading this morning but
[1:58:45] it's good amen the Bible is the word of
[1:58:49] God
[1:58:56] when you read Hebrews chapter 5 you see
[1:58:58] Paul right from the beginning year he
[1:59:01] begin to speak about uh uh this
[1:59:04] priesthood and then uh uh let's get
[1:59:09] right here over in verse
[1:59:11] 9 we can we can be able to make some
[1:59:14] argument yet and establish ourself for
[1:59:17] being made perfect he became the the
[1:59:20] author of internal salvation unto all
[1:59:23] them that obeyed him called of God and
[1:59:28] high priest after the order of mesc of
[1:59:31] whom we have many things to say that
[1:59:34] same statement again many things to say
[1:59:38] and hard to be
[1:59:41] uttered seeing ye a door of
[1:59:47] hearing for
[1:59:50] when for the time time you ought to be
[1:59:53] teachers ye have need that won teach you
[1:59:57] again which be the first principle
[2:00:00] teaching is always the first principle
[2:00:02] that the first thing we do to our
[2:00:04] children teaching is the first principle
[2:00:07] of the Oracle of God and I become such
[2:00:10] as have need of milk and now strong
[2:00:14] drink praise the Lord amen now see what
[2:00:19] he says now this is where we will take
[2:00:20] up from
[2:00:22] and uh and see if we can preach a little
[2:00:25] bit but strong strong May belong to them
[2:00:29] that are of a full age so you see all of
[2:00:33] those creature even though they feel
[2:00:36] their young
[2:00:38] milk but as they grow up they don't get
[2:00:41] them
[2:00:42] milk
[2:00:44] amen the mother the the the Lioness goes
[2:00:48] out to
[2:00:49] hunt and then she expect the babies to
[2:00:52] come and
[2:00:54] eat she's not going to feed him milk
[2:00:59] anymore are we together praise the
[2:01:05] Lord and uh so Paul is going to say
[2:01:09] something here but strong Meek belong to
[2:01:12] them that are of full age even those who
[2:01:15] by reason of use have their senses
[2:01:20] exercised to dis concern both good and
[2:01:24] evil praise the Lord so Paul in one
[2:01:28] sense he's he's defining what is
[2:01:31] spiritual
[2:01:34] maturity when you can be able to put the
[2:01:37] word into
[2:01:40] exercise praise the Lord when you are
[2:01:43] able to exercise yourself in the
[2:01:47] truth are we
[2:01:50] together praise the Lord
[2:01:52] when you are able to take what is been
[2:01:54] given to you what you've been taught and
[2:01:57] apply it and build upon
[2:02:02] it praise the Lord If the child would
[2:02:05] not take the spoon from the B right to
[2:02:07] their mouth we know that I mean they're
[2:02:09] just going to make a mess so we have to
[2:02:12] feed
[2:02:17] them are we together praise the Lord
[2:02:24] you find people you know we we we I mean
[2:02:28] around the faith you know I mean uh with
[2:02:31] all the the the you know uh things that
[2:02:36] are happening out there on the media and
[2:02:38] and all of that I mean we we must know
[2:02:40] what we are called
[2:02:42] to amen praise the lord we must know
[2:02:46] what we are called to if we if if we
[2:02:49] have been acknowledging the grace of God
[2:02:51] God in our life if we have been
[2:02:54] acknowledging how God have been merciful
[2:02:56] to
[2:02:57] us we must know what we are called to we
[2:03:00] have a generation you know just like uh
[2:03:03] Isaiah said in you know Isaiah chapter 4
[2:03:06] seven women will take hold of one man
[2:03:08] that was just an example you know uh uh
[2:03:11] and says well we will eat our own bread
[2:03:13] we will wear our own apparent all we
[2:03:16] want is just to be called by your
[2:03:19] name now we realize that's how the
[2:03:22] religious system is we can be called you
[2:03:25] know uh Church of Jesus Christ of
[2:03:27] deliverance we can be called you know
[2:03:28] Church on the on on fire for Jesus
[2:03:31] Christ we can be called church but we
[2:03:33] have in our own doctrine that is
[2:03:35] contrary to God's word we have our own
[2:03:38] appear that is contrary to God's word
[2:03:41] the people can dress anyhow do anything
[2:03:44] our Banner can be so big delivering
[2:03:46] burning fire bush of Jesus Christ we are
[2:03:49] just taking his name but providing our
[2:03:53] own
[2:03:55] apparel we want to dress in the house
[2:03:58] live in the how and still be called
[2:04:03] Christians when will we grow
[2:04:08] up praise the
[2:04:14] Lord and let's little thing happen then
[2:04:17] we start whining up that's a sign of a
[2:04:19] baby that's the only way the baby can
[2:04:21] call for for
[2:04:22] attention it's a god-given gift God give
[2:04:25] it to a baby if if she wants something
[2:04:27] she cry you have to figure how what's
[2:04:30] wrong with
[2:04:37] her did I do something to you no what
[2:04:40] happened
[2:04:44] no praise the
[2:04:49] Lord but you see when we talk about a
[2:04:52] bride we don't believe in honor age
[2:04:57] marriage amen
[2:05:00] no when we talk about a bride it's a
[2:05:03] stage in our walk with God it's a stage
[2:05:06] of maturity it's a state where we are
[2:05:09] making
[2:05:11] choices and making decision based on
[2:05:14] God's
[2:05:19] word praise the Lord
[2:05:26] so we see here uh uh uh I mean just just
[2:05:30] like Paul says here you know but strong
[2:05:33] me belong to them that are of full
[2:05:36] age amen that word for age means
[2:05:43] mure praise the Lord I mean if we will
[2:05:47] still be foring on uh uh uh some of the
[2:05:50] common things the things that nature s
[2:05:52] supposed to tell
[2:05:54] us there are some things that
[2:05:57] nature naturally it should tell
[2:06:04] us praise the
[2:06:08] Lord that if we say our body is the
[2:06:10] temple of God there are things that we
[2:06:12] must not put in it and there are things
[2:06:14] that also I mean uh we must not expose
[2:06:17] ourself uh you know to the public
[2:06:22] praise the
[2:06:32] Lord but you see just like Paul is is
[2:06:34] identifying just like I said the last
[2:06:37] time I mean you can call the little one
[2:06:39] and says you are a baby she say no I'm
[2:06:40] not a
[2:06:41] baby praise the
[2:06:46] Lord in her mind her mind is telling her
[2:06:49] I know how to wear my slippers
[2:06:52] praise the Lord whether she's putting it
[2:06:54] on left or right but she know that this
[2:06:57] is her
[2:06:58] slippers so she can be able to argue
[2:07:00] with you that she's not a baby she know
[2:07:02] how to find her
[2:07:04] slippers praise the
[2:07:09] Lord you see but but and and and that is
[2:07:12] the same thing with our walk with
[2:07:15] God praise the lord it's a spiritual
[2:07:19] growth
[2:07:21] and it is seen in the way we handle
[2:07:25] things in the way we present
[2:07:30] ourself that's where spiritual growth is
[2:07:39] seen and that's how God's grace is also
[2:07:45] appreciated Peter speaks of the same
[2:07:47] thing there in uh uh uh 1 Peter chapter
[2:07:50] 2
[2:07:52] uh verse 1 to3 he you know caution the
[2:07:55] Believers in the same
[2:07:58] thing let's read
[2:08:01] that wherefore laying aside all
[2:08:04] malice praise the
[2:08:06] Lord
[2:08:09] amen all malice is is uh you know Jesus
[2:08:14] when Jesus speaks about faith he he says
[2:08:17] uh you know uh uh uh unless we can we
[2:08:20] can we can uh enter to the kingdom of
[2:08:22] God like little children because they
[2:08:24] have this
[2:08:27] ability to
[2:08:30] forgive you know children little
[2:08:32] children they have that ability to
[2:08:34] forgive but they also have the ability
[2:08:36] to keep
[2:08:39] malice they will soon remind you what
[2:08:41] you did to
[2:08:44] them are we together they will soon
[2:08:47] remind you what you did to them but then
[2:08:50] you will see the beautiful nature about
[2:08:53] it is that the way they are free with
[2:08:56] you they are not holding against you but
[2:08:58] they just want to tell you that you were
[2:09:01] me wherefore laying aside all malice no
[2:09:04] hypocrit envy and all evil speaking Paul
[2:09:09] is identifying all of those things I
[2:09:11] mean to spiritual
[2:09:14] Believers just are the things that we we
[2:09:16] must be past
[2:09:18] gone if there are issue let's sit down
[2:09:20] and talk about
[2:09:26] it praise the
[2:09:33] Lord as a new baby uh desire the sincere
[2:09:36] milk of the word that ye may grow
[2:09:42] thereby and if we grow then we must also
[2:09:46] grow from
[2:09:48] milk amen
[2:09:52] I heard somebody say something and I
[2:09:55] love
[2:09:56] it milk the person said
[2:10:00] milk is a food that was
[2:10:06] digested is that truth oh yeah it's
[2:10:11] truth we get W get a c milk because it
[2:10:14] have digested the green
[2:10:19] grass praise the Lord
[2:10:21] as much as it sound funny as
[2:10:23] true amen glory be to God and that's the
[2:10:28] reason why like I said before you cannot
[2:10:31] just live off of the verse of the
[2:10:35] day whether it's a Bible verse whether
[2:10:38] it's a message quot it is somebody
[2:10:44] meditation you can't live of it if that
[2:10:47] is just the only thing that is
[2:10:49] sustaining your Christian Life
[2:10:54] at least baby can get milk in the
[2:10:56] morning milk in the afternoon praise the
[2:11:00] Lord so find the verse for the day in
[2:11:02] the morning find the verse for the day
[2:11:05] in the
[2:11:06] afternoon and uh in the evening and the
[2:11:09] night since since you since I mean uh
[2:11:12] you uh uh you are being sustained on
[2:11:17] milk praise the Lord amen
[2:11:21] but I mean as a as a as a as a as as a
[2:11:24] full grown uh you know uh uh uh uh where
[2:11:28] where's the young man I think it's there
[2:11:30] I call him out there jna junor yes last
[2:11:33] week after service he came to me in the
[2:11:35] office I told himself to write that
[2:11:37] thing of and he didn't write it and give
[2:11:39] it to me uh to to show me what he what
[2:11:42] he been studying on you know he been
[2:11:44] steuding on the gifts of the
[2:11:47] Spirit you know and then he's writing
[2:11:50] and and and so so he's explaining all of
[2:11:52] that so I said okay you write it down
[2:11:53] decent and give it to me on Sunday
[2:11:56] praise the Lord you know because I I
[2:11:59] actually had I had my thoughts I was
[2:12:01] going to go in this direction on Sunday
[2:12:03] and and because you see it's it's a
[2:12:05] sense of where you are getting in the
[2:12:09] word you are getting in the
[2:12:14] word praise the
[2:12:18] Lord you are beginning to look at these
[2:12:20] things
[2:12:22] it's not just a it's not just a you know
[2:12:26] uh a chapter you realize that the word
[2:12:28] is
[2:12:37] connected are we together and you see
[2:12:40] this this this age that we are in this
[2:12:42] information age I mean it's it's almost
[2:12:45] like everything every everything I mean
[2:12:48] uh there's somebody that have put some
[2:12:50] kind of information
[2:12:51] you could get the right one you could
[2:12:52] get the wrong
[2:12:58] one I mean God has blessed our age so
[2:13:01] much that you take some of these Bible
[2:13:03] apps on your phone they can even give
[2:13:06] you the Greek word they can give you
[2:13:08] they can break down I mean just for you
[2:13:10] are not becoming a theologian but you
[2:13:12] see it's putting it's putting you to the
[2:13:14] place where you know what the word of
[2:13:17] God is becoming your meditation
[2:13:24] and if you even if we even want to go
[2:13:26] farther that with that you will realize
[2:13:28] that uh uh uh the the the the the clean
[2:13:32] animals both in the Act and the ones
[2:13:35] that uh that's that Noah I mean that
[2:13:38] Moses uh uh classified as being clean
[2:13:40] animal if you really study them they
[2:13:42] having most of them having uh uh two two
[2:13:46] unique uh uh uh identities
[2:13:51] praise the Lord most of the clean
[2:13:53] animals are the animals that chew their
[2:13:58] cup amen the ability to chew it swallow
[2:14:02] it bring it back up again and chew
[2:14:07] it praise the Lord in the eyes of a
[2:14:11] person it looks like oh my God they
[2:14:13] bringing it out and chewing it again all
[2:14:15] that's that's nasty but uh uh God's
[2:14:18] applying there to us as a sheep of his
[2:14:24] pasture we must be able to chew on the
[2:14:27] word look at it
[2:14:31] again James said we must not be
[2:14:33] forgetful
[2:14:41] heers are we
[2:14:44] together you see that and and that is
[2:14:46] the reason why the it's hard for the
[2:14:49] people to break into the Super
[2:14:51] Supernatural because they want to they
[2:14:53] want to handle Divine gifts when they
[2:14:56] don't have the moral character for
[2:14:59] it when we have not been able to grow in
[2:15:02] moral
[2:15:04] character we have now started speaking
[2:15:07] evil of one another and blackmailing one
[2:15:09] another and then we want we want
[2:15:11] Supernatural
[2:15:14] manifestation praise the lord the devil
[2:15:17] can give you an
[2:15:19] impersonation amen amen he can give you
[2:15:21] an impersonation run down the out and
[2:15:24] and and shout and speak in tongues and
[2:15:25] then few days we hear you insulting and
[2:15:28] and uh and and you know and all of
[2:15:41] that you see that's that is that is the
[2:15:43] thing with the
[2:15:45] church praise the Lord amen
[2:15:51] think about
[2:15:53] this when Jesus gathered those
[2:16:00] disciples they started seeing him
[2:16:02] healing the sck and you know and and all
[2:16:05] of the things he was doing he brought
[2:16:07] them to a place
[2:16:10] where he commissioned them and sent them
[2:16:13] out to at a time praise the Lord send
[2:16:18] out two by two and the Bible says there
[2:16:21] in the Book of
[2:16:24] Luke he told them I've given you
[2:16:27] power praise the Lord just realize now
[2:16:30] see this this was just in the infancy of
[2:16:33] the
[2:16:34] church okay I've given you power
[2:16:36] scorpions are subject unto you these
[2:16:38] guys went out I mean now uh just one day
[2:16:42] Crusade they have or one day the Revival
[2:16:45] they had I mean they came back shouting
[2:16:47] all in the
[2:16:49] community praise the Lord the other Gody
[2:16:52] says see you see let let me tell you
[2:16:54] when you finish talking your own let me
[2:16:55] tell you my
[2:16:57] own praise the
[2:17:00] Lord they were so excited I mean I pray
[2:17:03] for somebody that was sick they God
[2:17:07] heal praise the
[2:17:09] Lord
[2:17:11] amen and then when they got they come
[2:17:14] they came to
[2:17:16] Jesus he said uh he told them and he
[2:17:20] said
[2:17:24] I saw Satan
[2:17:27] falling like a lightning you know what
[2:17:31] that means it means every time the
[2:17:34] believer comes into position on the
[2:17:38] word praise the
[2:17:41] Lord you see you read the book of Jude
[2:17:45] the Bible says not even Michel the
[2:17:49] aangel never brought no realing
[2:17:52] accusation against the
[2:17:54] devil all he needed to do was just to
[2:17:57] take his
[2:17:58] position and says the Lord rebuked
[2:18:03] thee praise the Lord the most thing that
[2:18:06] the devil is afraid of is a Son of God
[2:18:09] or a daughter of God that is standing on
[2:18:12] God's
[2:18:17] word praise the lord the devil knows
[2:18:20] they you create an earthquake for him
[2:18:23] because right from the beginning when he
[2:18:25] was cast down he has been in a
[2:18:29] descending order when when Isaiah saw
[2:18:32] him says oh how are thou Fallen oh
[2:18:35] Lucifer when Jesus saw him he says I saw
[2:18:38] Satan falling like a lightning he's in
[2:18:41] the descending order praise the Lord is
[2:18:44] when we leave the word that's when he
[2:18:46] take position on our shoulders
[2:18:51] but when you stand on the word you
[2:18:53] create an earthquake for the
[2:19:03] devil praise the Lord he said I saw
[2:19:07] Satan falling like a lightning he's
[2:19:10] already
[2:19:11] falling just imagine the church in its
[2:19:14] infancy they are breaking into the
[2:19:17] supernatural they just started tasting
[2:19:19] of the heavenly things how much more
[2:19:23] when we line our lives
[2:19:25] up praise the
[2:19:28] Lord amen where the the the the the
[2:19:32] gifts of God is birth in the people and
[2:19:35] young people are are rising up as Sons
[2:19:38] and Daughters of
[2:19:41] God praise the lord we are not looking
[2:19:44] for things for uh to build our case and
[2:19:46] excuses and all of that
[2:19:56] are we
[2:20:04] together so you see we're talking about
[2:20:06] this treat of life let's read it a
[2:20:09] little
[2:20:11] bit the truth and false Vine a very
[2:20:14] beautiful type today when the church is
[2:20:17] hungry God want his children filled with
[2:20:20] the bread of life now with some t uh uh
[2:20:24] T but with the bread of life who and
[2:20:27] what is the bread of life Jesus said I'm
[2:20:30] the bread of life that came from God out
[2:20:32] of Heaven said your father eat Manor in
[2:20:35] the wilderness that John six they eat
[2:20:37] man in W Manor in the wilderness and
[2:20:40] they are everyone dead I'm the bread of
[2:20:42] life that comes from comes from God out
[2:20:45] of Heaven If any man eat this bread he
[2:20:48] shall never die
[2:20:51] or in other words I am the Tree of Life
[2:20:54] from the Garden of
[2:20:56] Eden and if they eat of the the tree of
[2:21:00] death they die if they eat of the Tree
[2:21:01] of Life they going to live praise the
[2:21:04] lord we continue to read there the Holy
[2:21:08] Spirit gathered the tree of life until
[2:21:12] the atonement was made pray of Praise
[2:21:16] the Lord when the atonement was made
[2:21:18] which is the death of Christ
[2:21:21] the tree of life became a
[2:21:24] person because right from Eden the tree
[2:21:27] of life was representing
[2:21:29] Jesus but it was under a shadow form
[2:21:32] until he came and paid the price to
[2:21:35] redeem the Earth
[2:21:37] back praise the Lord so when he paid the
[2:21:41] price on the cross of Calvary and said
[2:21:44] Satan is
[2:21:46] finished and came back to the church in
[2:21:49] the form of the Holy
[2:21:53] Ghost praise the Lord now we have the
[2:21:57] tree of life we have the Tree of Life in
[2:22:00] plain
[2:22:01] view praise the
[2:22:06] Lord he says I will never leave you I
[2:22:09] will never forsake
[2:22:10] you praise the
[2:22:12] Lord that time they had to go to the
[2:22:15] Tree of Life this time our tree of life
[2:22:17] follow follow us he said these signs
[2:22:19] shall follow them them that believe so
[2:22:22] our tree of life is following
[2:22:29] us are we
[2:22:31] together the Holy Spirit gu the treat of
[2:22:34] life until the atonement was m and now
[2:22:37] the holy spirit is running the people to
[2:22:39] the tree of life amen that's why the
[2:22:43] preaching of the Gospel is all
[2:22:47] about let's wrong let's get back to
[2:22:50] where we supposed to be if we fall let's
[2:22:53] wake up let's get
[2:22:58] back praise the
[2:23:00] Lord
[2:23:01] amen Adam and Eve was trying to get to
[2:23:04] the tree of life now they are children
[2:23:07] are trying to stay away from the treat
[2:23:09] of Life the holy spirit is the holy
[2:23:11] spirit was guiding and is bringing them
[2:23:14] to it and they and they refus to hear
[2:23:18] the holy spirit voice because the same
[2:23:22] adversary the devil that caused them to
[2:23:25] sin in the beginning is keeping them
[2:23:27] away from the Tree of Life praise the
[2:23:31] lord we just want a shua
[2:23:34] gospel
[2:23:42] amen but we have a living
[2:23:47] God that is so anxious to make himself
[2:23:50] new to you I'm telling you young people

[2:24:38] uh uh uh it was guided right till the
[2:24:41] atonement now the Tree of Life Is With
[2:24:44] Us he's the bread of life he's the
[2:24:46] Living Water amen that's Jesus Christ so
[2:24:49] the treat of life is now in plain
[2:24:52] view praise the Lord amen he said man
[2:24:56] shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:24:58] every word that proceed out of my mouth

[2:25:44] Lord I mean you can we can read the word
[2:25:47] and it's too far from
[2:25:49] us why because we are thinking about
[2:25:51] David in his trouble we are thinking
[2:25:54] about you know uh oh wow David and all
[2:25:56] of that you see and and that's one of

[2:26:10] back and just show you you see David
[2:26:13] talking about uh uh uh my enemies now
[2:26:17] you have to remember just like Psalm
[2:26:20] chap 22 when David said my God my God
[2:26:23] why have Thou forsaken me praise the
[2:26:26] Lord you have to remember that under
[2:26:30] inspiration he spoke in the first
[2:26:33] person amen he spoke in the first person
[2:26:38] so many of the time I was thinking about
[2:26:40] it this week I says oh my God because
[2:26:42] you see people take that trench of
[2:26:45] David's s and and and you know David is
[2:26:48] talking about his enemies and and the
[2:26:50] Wicked and all of that but if you really
[2:26:53] study the sign you will see that many
[2:26:55] times David is also speaking in the
[2:26:58] first person he's talking in the place
[2:27:01] of
[2:27:02] God so he's talking about those that
[2:27:06] hate the law of God when he said those
[2:27:09] that hate me and those that will not do
[2:27:11] my Commandments he's not talking about
[2:27:14] his
[2:27:16] soldiers praise the Lord
[2:27:20] he's not talking about his soldiers
[2:27:22] because sometimes I I mean if if you
[2:27:24] were even there then David was under
[2:27:27] inspiration and and and and he's and
[2:27:29] he's and he's crying and saying my God
[2:27:32] my God why have Thou forsaken me you
[2:27:33] will see this guy is
[2:27:36] ungrateful God has been so good to him
[2:27:38] how can he be praying in there and
[2:27:40] saying God why are you forsaking
[2:27:44] me praise the Lord but you see David was
[2:27:48] far he was far he was honor an
[2:27:51] inspiration he was honor an anointing he
[2:27:54] was
[2:27:57] prophesying that would be the very
[2:28:02] word you see but now our our our church
[2:28:06] days our church word we forget about our
[2:28:11] lord Jesus on the cross and say father
[2:28:14] counted not to their curse forgive them
[2:28:18] no we don't want that one we want this
[2:28:20] David David destroy his enemy Lord kill
[2:28:23] my
[2:28:24] enemies my enemies where are the
[2:28:30] enemies you realize you check it or you
[2:28:33] you yourself you are your own enemy we
[2:28:36] ourself become our own
[2:28:40] enemy why were you worried about that
[2:28:44] when God promised to be your
[2:28:47] Fortress he says as the mountain is
[2:28:49] surround the Jerusalem so the Lord is
[2:28:52] around his
[2:28:57] people if we are abiding under the
[2:28:59] shadow of the almighty and staying in
[2:29:02] line with God's word why will you be
[2:29:04] worrying about
[2:29:14] enemies praise the Lord
[2:29:21] looking for something where it's not
[2:29:31] there when this is the age this is the
[2:29:34] dispensation where the mercy seed has
[2:29:37] dropped
[2:29:38] down I wanted to talk about the mercy
[2:29:41] seed this morning I I just been trying
[2:29:42] to push it away a little bit but it's a
[2:29:45] beautiful it's a just just a beautiful
[2:29:47] thing out of God's word
[2:29:54] just a beautiful thing out of God's
[2:29:58] word because until this Mercy Seat has
[2:30:03] been made rear in our
[2:30:05] hearts we can save this
[2:30:08] generation because the generation is so
[2:30:11] evil the generation is so
[2:30:14] ning I mean evil is just springing out
[2:30:17] from everywhere
[2:30:23] but who's going to be Jesus
[2:30:28] today praise the
[2:30:35] lord we we we we just we are we are just
[2:30:39] we are just so filled with
[2:30:41] judgmental Spirit we judge we criticize
[2:30:44] we condemn
[2:30:52] praise the
[2:30:54] lord we are carrying an act with no
[2:30:57] mercy
[2:31:01] seat when you are just legalistic and
[2:31:04] you just get the law you just get the
[2:31:06] law the law the
[2:31:09] law your AR of the Covenant does not
[2:31:11] have cover
[2:31:24] praise the Lord but there on Calvary we
[2:31:27] saw
[2:31:29] Mercy when it spit in his
[2:31:33] face the disfigure his his his face by
[2:31:36] pulling off the beard on his
[2:31:39] face we saw
[2:31:43] mercy and it's that same Mercy that want
[2:31:46] to drop in your heart it's that same
[2:31:49] Mercy that want to drop in our
[2:31:53] heart and change our
[2:32:00] life praise the
[2:32:03] Lord is that same
[2:32:06] Mercy I want to drop in our hearts and
[2:32:08] change our
[2:32:12] life glory be to
[2:32:15] God you see if if if we are honor the
[2:32:18] guidance and honor the influence of uh
[2:32:22] of uh of the cherubin if we are under
[2:32:24] the influence you know they will
[2:32:26] influence us to
[2:32:31] Mercy praise the
[2:32:36] Lord Isaiah was there in the temple the
[2:32:39] Bible says there when he when he when he
[2:32:42] when he saw that uh uh uh uh
[2:32:46] uh yuzer his friend died and and and and
[2:32:50] you know he F so condemned before God
[2:32:52] and start crying to God what is man I'm
[2:32:55] a man undone and you know the Bible says
[2:32:58] it was one that took a fire one of those
[2:33:00] angels left that place came down and P a
[2:33:05] cat of fire upon the prophet that was
[2:33:08] God's
[2:33:10] mercy that was God's mercy to Isaiah it
[2:33:14] was also God's mercy to the people of
[2:33:17] Israel because he would come out of that
[2:33:19] Vision with a different Ministry praise
[2:33:22] the Lord he will go so hard and talk
[2:33:25] about a virgin shall conceive unto us a
[2:33:28] child is born he will go so hard and
[2:33:30] talk about the
[2:33:32] Millennium praise the
[2:33:35] Lord he will go so high and let us know
[2:33:39] what happened how Satan was cast out in
[2:33:41] the
[2:33:44] beginning praise the
[2:33:47] Lord when you experience
[2:33:50] God's mercy it brings you closer to him
[2:33:56] amen God can be able to lift you in the
[2:33:59] realm of seeing things and understanding
[2:34:02] things getting to know his nature
[2:34:06] because that's what his nature is it's a
[2:34:08] god that is full of
[2:34:14] Mercy praise the Lord I mean that's
[2:34:17] that's where the church is
[2:34:21] that is that is where our problem
[2:34:24] is we are placed in in in an age where
[2:34:27] hell has break loose and we having all
[2:34:29] of these things happening around
[2:34:32] us praise the
[2:34:35] Lord
[2:34:37] amen we see the kind of a society that
[2:34:40] we are living
[2:34:42] in we having uh you know uh uh uh LGBT
[2:34:47] and and all of that that's that's Our
[2:34:50] Generation that's the age that we are in
[2:34:53] the Bible says as it was in the days of
[2:34:55] sodon and
[2:34:58] gomorra praise the
[2:35:00] Lord but let me ask you a question when
[2:35:03] Abraham went down there to redeem lot
[2:35:06] did he went down there asking the people
[2:35:09] is it that the very same people from
[2:35:10] Sodom he went out to fight
[2:35:14] for praise the
[2:35:17] Lord no he could say all those places
[2:35:20] it's abominable place I mean all of
[2:35:22] those people they even wanted to sleep
[2:35:24] with the angel I don't have no time for
[2:35:33] them you see if Mercy has not been has
[2:35:36] not come to our heart we will not even
[2:35:38] know how to relate to the people out
[2:35:42] there and those very people going to be
[2:35:45] your buses those very people will be
[2:35:47] people you will you will fly a plane
[2:35:48] with you will not even know how to have
[2:35:51] a conversation with
[2:35:53] them why because now you sitting down
[2:35:56] somebody you are in hell all in your mou
[2:35:59] oh my God let this PL just reach oh my
[2:36:02] God the person is not the problem you
[2:36:05] that the
[2:36:08] problem you are in a spiritual
[2:36:12] prison that's not
[2:36:16] Christianity that's why Jesus was called
[2:36:18] one Berber because he talked to the
[2:36:21] drunkers on the
[2:36:33] street that's the age we are in that's
[2:36:36] the society we have how are we going to
[2:36:43] live so well I stay in my house and I
[2:36:45] will order everything online they are
[2:36:47] the very same people that is packaging
[2:36:48] it to send it to you
[2:37:02] you you know how much you have
[2:37:05] experience God's mercy when your heart
[2:37:08] is tender towards
[2:37:12] men when your heart becomes tender
[2:37:15] towards men
[2:37:27] praise the
[2:37:30] lord we find and see many of those
[2:37:32] people that are caught up trapped in
[2:37:35] those livest God's Mercy is visiting
[2:37:38] them and they are giving their heart
[2:37:39] back to God we will look at that and be
[2:37:41] thankful but go out of the room see
[2:37:43] another one and start criticizing them
[2:37:57] I mean if we can criticize one another
[2:37:59] as much as decent we try to
[2:38:04] dress praise the
[2:38:07] Lord when we can be so judgmental to
[2:38:12] ourself how are we going to help anybody
[2:38:22] praise the
[2:38:26] Lord the Holy Ghost supposed to bring us
[2:38:30] internal
[2:38:32] security but you having the people so
[2:38:35] insecure they are so
[2:38:39] insecure they come to the house of God
[2:38:41] they are so insecure
[2:38:50] when the Holy Ghost supposed to give us
[2:38:52] internal
[2:38:54] security it's supposed to raise our
[2:38:57] level of trust and confidence in God's
[2:39:02] word but we become so

[2:43:52] again he was trying to get back to the
[2:43:56] Garden of Eden again where the cherubin
[2:43:59] was I imagine they they went to the east
[2:44:03] side where the cherubin was guing the
[2:44:06] tree of life and they were trying to get
[2:44:08] back and the man with the destination of

[2:48:44] on
[2:48:46] just asking the Lord to just help me
[2:48:50] look into the subject
[2:48:53] and but one thing I
[2:48:56] learned you can't help anybody by first
[2:48:59] shaming
[2:49:03] them and many of the time what the devil
[2:49:05] would do is there he will shame a person
[2:49:09] in your
[2:49:13] mind and
[2:49:16] because he makes the person to to look
[2:49:19] so
[2:49:22] shameful all because he just want to
[2:49:25] handle
[2:49:34] you but take it think about
[2:49:41] it some of the kids that are friends to
[2:49:44] our
[2:49:45] kids don't know any better
[2:49:55] how are we preparing our kids to deal
[2:49:57] with it with those
[2:50:02] things if we are not preparing them they
[2:50:04] can even tell from how we are dealing
[2:50:06] with our owner
[2:50:09] issues the conversation we have
[2:50:14] home sometime the prayer needs that we
[2:50:17] bring up
[2:50:21] do you ever take up a prayer need oh I
[2:50:23] saw a lady at the Walmart oh God I don't
[2:50:27] know her name but my heart just reached
[2:50:29] out for
[2:50:32] her can you pass by someone sit down in
[2:50:35] your car slam the door and just say oh
[2:50:38] God just help her help that young man
[2:50:45] Lord or do we just go what is this again
[2:50:49] oh my
[2:50:53] God what next will we
[2:51:12] see if we have experienced God's tender
[2:51:15] mercy and to know that it is by by his
[2:51:19] Mercy that is by his Mercy that we are
[2:51:22] not
[2:51:24] consumed that there is nothing of
[2:51:26] ourself we can count
[2:51:28] ourself worth it of the grace of God
[2:51:31] that have come to
[2:51:41] us you ever think of yourself that you
[2:51:43] so
[2:51:45] better that you can't give another m to
[2:51:48] the handshake
[2:51:50] I think we need to find our place to the
[2:51:52] altar find our place to the foot of the
[2:51:55] cross and say God have mercy upon
[2:52:12] me how can we get over to the treat of
[2:52:15] Life how can we really feed on the word
[2:52:17] of God how we we feeding on the word of
[2:52:19] God without
[2:52:20] Mercy without going by the way of of the
[2:52:24] cherubin without getting to The Mercy
[2:52:26] Seat how we getting to the Commandments
[2:52:28] of
[2:52:30] God that's the reason why we hear the
