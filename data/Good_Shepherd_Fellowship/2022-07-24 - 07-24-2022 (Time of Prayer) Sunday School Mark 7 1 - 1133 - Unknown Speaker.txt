========================================

tradition for moses said honor thy father and thy mother and whoso curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say if a man shall say to his father or mother it is corban that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou might just be profited by me he shall be free and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which he have delivered and many such like things do ye and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man if any man have ears to hear let him hear and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable and he saith unto them are ye so without understanding also do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defile him because it entereth not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draft purging all meats and he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness all these evil things come from within and defile the man and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tyre and zidane and entered into a house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet the woman was a greek a syrophoenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way. the devil is gone out of my daughter and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed and again departing from the coasts of tyre and zidane he came unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coasts of decapolis and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him that is be opened and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plane and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it and were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat and if i send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from far and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness and he asked them how many lobes have ye and they said seven and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and break and gave to his disciples to set before them and they did set them before the people and they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to set them also before them so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them away and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of dalmanutha and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why does this generation seek after a sign verily i say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation and he left them and entering into the ship again departed to the other side now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf and he charged them saying take heed beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the leaven of herod and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have no bread and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand have ye your heart yet hardened having eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember when i break the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up they say unto him twelve and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up and they said seven and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw ought and he looked up and said i see man as trees walking after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly and he sent him away to his house saying neither go into the town nor tell it to any in the town and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say that i am and they answered john the baptist but some say elias and others one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ and he charged them that they should tell no man of him and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again and he spake that saying openly and peter took him and began to rebuke him but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savorist not the things that be of god but the things that be of men and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels and he said unto them verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them and his ramen became shining exceeding white as snow so as no fuller on earth can white them and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they were talking with jesus and peter answered and said to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias for he whisked not what to say for they were sore afraid and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him and suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no man anymore save jesus only with themselves and as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man were risen from the dead and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean and they asked him saying why say the scribes that elias must first come and he answered and told them elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at naught but i say unto you that elias is indeed come and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them and straightway all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him and he asked the scribes what question ye with them and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he formeth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child and of times it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us jesus said unto him if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help thou mine unbelief when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead in so much that many said he is dead but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately why could not we cast him out and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting and they departed thence and passed through galilee and he would not that any man should know it for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of man is delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is killed he shall rise the third day but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest and he sat down and called the twelve and seth unto them if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbid him because he followeth not us but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hellfire where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another and he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of judea by the father side of jordan and the people resort unto him again and as he was want he taught them again and the pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him and he answered and said unto them what did moses command you and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for if such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is god now knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved and jesus looking upon them seth with men it is impossible but not with god but with god all things are possible then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life but many that are first shall be last and the last first and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him saying master we would that thou should just do for us whatsoever we shall desire and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with and they said unto him we can and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized with all shall ye be baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with james and john but jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of man came not to be ministered onto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timeas sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee. the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made the whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto beth fiji and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as you be entered into it you shall find a cult tied where on never man sat lose him and bring him and if any man say unto you why do ye this say ye that the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither and they went their way and found the cult tied by the door without in a place where two ways met and they loose him and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loosing the cult and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded and they let them go and they brought the cult to jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon him and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strawed them in the way and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked round about upon all things and now the even tide was come he went out onto bethany with the twelve and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves and the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine and when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursed is withered away and jesus answering seth unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders and say unto him by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority to do these things and jesus answered and said unto them i will also ask of you one question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men hansome and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him but if we shall say of men they feared the people for all men counted john that he was a prophet indeed and they answered and said unto jesus we cannot tell and jesus answering saith unto them neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things [Music]
