[0:28] so
[0:44] what was it called philadelphia the
[0:46] greatest age of love we've ever had
[0:49] the philadelphian age was ryan john
[0:52] wesley's time
[0:53] when he went out income pentecost and
[0:55] that was
[0:56] lukewarm then we go back and find out
[1:00] what kind
[1:00] of a message would come to the
[1:02] pentecostals
[1:03] at the end remember each one come at the
[1:05] end of the age st
[1:07] paul comes in the rest of them coming
[1:09] out the insane
[1:10] arenas all the rest of them the other
[1:12] ones aged carried over to the other one
[1:13] left over and he take it up went on to
[1:15] the next stage with it
[1:16] see now we find out in this age
[1:20] there's a stars we have there we have a
[1:23] star messenger
[1:24] we have a person a message that goes
[1:26] forth to the age
[1:28] of people to reject it of people to
[1:29] receive it and
[1:31] the messenger of this age was to come in
[1:34] the power of elise
[1:40] and he was to restore the faith
[1:43] of the children back to the fathers
[1:48] bring the pentecostal remnant that's
[1:50] left
[1:51] back to the true apostolic faith amen
[1:55] now the true apostolic faith if you'll
[1:58] read it in the book of acts
[2:01] you'll find that there was never one
[2:03] time one person ever baptized the name
[2:05] of father son holy ghost
[2:07] that was never one of them ever
[2:08] sprinkled there was none of this stuff
[2:11] that we have going on today called
[2:12] pentecost that ever happened back there
[2:15] they had true manifestations and the
[2:17] spirit of god among them that was
[2:19] infallibly the son of god working with
[2:21] him
[2:24] this person that was to come forth this
[2:26] message rather that was to come forth
[2:27] to be like elijah elijah was to come
[2:31] three times
[2:32] now you say that john the baptist is
[2:34] that guy if you notice jesus said it was
[2:36] the john
[2:36] the baptist was the messenger of malachi
[2:38] 3 not malachi 4.
[2:40] behold i say my messenger before my face
[2:42] i think matthew 11
[2:44] 6 right down along there you'll find
[2:46] matthew 11 chapter
[2:48] now but in this last days there's to
[2:51] come
[2:51] a spirit of elijah amongst the people
[2:55] he needs to do the same thing that they
[2:58] did back there
[2:59] his nature would be the same thing the
[3:01] nature of the church the nature of the
[3:03] person would be exactly the same thing
[3:04] in that message going on trying
[3:06] he'd be hated by the people he'd hate
[3:08] women honorary ones anyhow
[3:10] bad ones love the wilderness
[3:14] moody upset god all the time like elijah
[3:16] was like john was
[3:18] and we've seen all this thing come to
[3:21] pass
[3:23] if we have had the message we see christ
[3:25] rejected
[3:27] you have to belong to one of these
[3:28] organizations where you can't get into
[3:29] them amen
[3:30] so he's told on the outside yeah
[3:34] christ can't work among them what are
[3:37] you
[3:38] i'm christian what denomination belonged
[3:40] to i don't belong to any we can't use
[3:42] you
[3:43] see he's rejected i see it rejected
[3:48] so was elijah rejected and so was john
[3:51] rejected
[3:52] but what did it hurt them did it hurt
[3:55] their message
[3:56] they said oh you're stiff necks
[4:02] they didn't pull any punches they went
[4:04] right ahead
[4:07] god's message will move right on
[4:08] regardless what anybody said
[4:14] until the consummation and when the
[4:17] that's which is determined shall be
[4:18] poured out
[4:19] and we're at the end down we find
[4:22] ourselves now in 40 years
[4:24] of coming back since the first world war
[4:27] and the jews have returned back to their
[4:29] own land
[4:30] god never did deal with israel until she
[4:33] was in her own land
[4:35] now you remember when the jews was
[4:36] returning back them jews and down in the
[4:38] other nations
[4:38] and the look magazine gave the article
[4:40] of it
[4:42] i read a clipping from some paper some
[4:45] religious magazine
[4:46] that when they them planes went out
[4:49] there to pick up these jews way down in
[4:51] iran and i don't know where all they
[4:53] were they scattered down now that's the
[4:55] true jews
[4:56] they have never had an opportunity uh
[5:00] brother there's your 144 thousand
[5:03] when we get to revelation 11 you'll see
[5:04] him he said there are 12 tribes of gad
[5:06] 12 tribes of ace you're 12 tribes of
[5:08] reuben
[5:09] tribes and where were they all standing
[5:10] on mount sinai
[5:12] amen jews back in the homeland
[5:15] there they were they were the ones that
[5:17] wasn't this wall street crooked bunch
[5:20] no sir it was the real jew and when this
[5:23] old rabbi stood out there and seen this
[5:25] plane land
[5:26] them jews you read it in a magazine
[5:27] there were still plows wooden clouds
[5:30] and when they seen that thing set down
[5:32] out there they wasn't going around it
[5:34] that old rabbi stood out and said
[5:36] remember our prophet said
[5:38] when we go back to our homeland we'll be
[5:40] carried back on the wings of an eagle
[5:42] [Applause]
[5:42] [Music]
[5:44] nations are breaking israel's awakening
[5:49] the signs that the prophets foretold
[5:52] where he didn't fix they hit that
[5:54] seventh week for him
[5:56] i think myself standing out there and my
[5:59] brother petra said on them little
[6:00] testaments and they read him they said
[6:02] well if this be the messiah
[6:04] let us see him do the sign of the
[6:05] prophet if he isn't dead he's alive
[6:08] they said he raised up again he lives in
[6:10] his church let us see him do the sign of
[6:11] the prophet and we'll believe him
[6:13] the jews always believe they know the
[6:16] messiah was to be prophet
[6:19] and when i stood out you know brother
[6:20] oregon writes that day you have to place
[6:22] them jews then they said just come to
[6:23] our place our people
[6:24] i said sure i'll be glad to come just
[6:26] made a decision too quick
[6:28] i got to cairo egypt the other night
[6:31] when i seen
[6:32] that plane coming down there cairo
[6:35] reminded me
[6:36] so when we got back there and i had my
[6:38] ticket to go up to israel he's going to
[6:39] meet me
[6:40] i said go gather up a few thousands of
[6:42] the leaders
[6:43] bring him out on the plane somewhere we
[6:45] find out whether he's still a prophet or
[6:47] not
[6:48] amen hallelujah well let's see what
[6:51] he'll do
[6:52] oh that was just right in their hand
[6:53] that's what they wanted they could see
[6:55] that they'd believe it
[6:57] so what did i do got down there cairo
[6:59] and started to go up there
[7:01] gonna have my ticket about 20 minutes of
[7:02] calling down something said not now
[7:06] the cup of iniquities of the gentiles
[7:08] isn't full yet
[7:11] the amorites hasn't been fulfilled
[7:14] stay out of there i thought maybe i just
[7:16] imagined that
[7:17] i went out behind the hangar and prayed
[7:19] that stay out of there now
[7:21] then i took my ticket went somewhere
[7:22] else
[7:24] i didn't go for the hour isn't yet
[7:28] now what time that god's going to allow
[7:30] those jews to start dealing with them
[7:32] again
[7:32] i cannot tell you i don't know nobody
[7:35] knows that
[7:36] but listen if israel is already in her
[7:38] homeland

[7:41] in the irrigation the waters and
[7:43] everything that god promised they found
[7:44] wells and things there big open streams
[7:46] that that's the most beautiful place
[7:48] you've ever seen they got a city built
[7:50] there
[7:52] they got irrigation they got the best
[7:54] land there is the world there and we
[7:55] find out right in this
[7:56] dead sea there's more chemicals enough
[7:58] to buy the world over
[8:00] see everything's felt right in their
[8:03] hands
[8:05] how did they do it because hitler's
[8:07] heart was hardened
[8:09] miscellaneous heart was hardened just
[8:11] like pharaoh's heart was hardened
[8:13] and driving them back in that land
[8:16] and for four years they've been coming
[8:18] back into that land
[8:19] now there are they set waiting
[8:23] the gentile church is in the lady of sin
[8:26] into the lady of sea and age
[8:28] if the jews are in their homeland

[8:37] have a nation broke up like we have
[8:39] we have atomic bombs hanging in the
[8:41] hangars we have a church's lukewarm
[8:44] we have a church of people let's pull
[8:45] ourselves together we have a ministry
[8:47] that
[8:48] patterns the ministry of jesus christ
[8:49] for the catch of stone when it comes
[8:51] what's left to happen
[8:56] it might be at any minute there is
[8:59] nothing else left
[9:03] we're at the end time amen all glory

[9:52] last age
[9:53] and for 40 years i'm jews has been

[10:16] god will declare it when it is i don't
[10:19] know
[10:20] i'm wondering but i'm going to bring
[10:22] something here
[10:24] now in a few minutes and i don't know
[10:26] where you go to believe it or not
[10:27] but i i've got to say it anyhow
[10:31] we're at the homeland the jews are in a
[10:34] homeland
[10:35] we're at the end of the age ready for
[10:37] the rapture
[10:38] the rapture comes the church goes up
[10:40] we're caught up to meet him in air we
[10:41] all know that
[10:42] the stone that was cut out of the
[10:43] mountain is ready to come at any time
[10:45] and when it comes what does it do
[10:48] it does away with the gentile age
[10:51] it's all over and god completely quits
[10:53] dealing with them
[10:55] let him as filthy be filthy still that's
[10:58] him it's holy be holy still
[11:00] see what does he do then he takes his
[11:02] church
[11:03] the holy ghost filled what's the filthy
[11:06] that's the sleeping virgin of them it
[11:07] comes up for judgment
[11:10] way over in here we'll get that on
[11:11] another map
[11:13] when we continue this one over where she
[11:15] comes up to the white throne judgment
[11:17] and has to be judged by the redeemed
[11:20] paul told us not to take a matter to
[11:21] court because
[11:22] the saints would judge the earth yes sir
[11:25] that's right we're at the end times here
[11:28] now all right and in the middle
[11:32] of this week now here's the 70 now if
[11:36] these exactly was seven years each one
[11:38] of the weeks
[11:39] and we've already had 69 weeks then we
[11:42] have the gentile age
[11:43] and we're nowhere at the end of the
[11:45] gentile age and there's one more week
[11:46] left
[11:47] for the jew is that right and that's
[11:49] exactly seven years
[11:52] if this was seven years that's seven
[11:54] years
[11:55] because he said there's 70 weeks
[11:57] determined upon thy people
[11:58] so we know we got seven years for the
[12:01] jews is that true
[12:02] now look at it if it's a question i want
[12:04] to know it see now
[12:06] and in the middle of the week
[12:09] the middle of this jewish week see
[12:11] that's three and a half years
[12:14] years the antichrist the prince
[12:17] of prince that is to come and remember
[12:20] he comes
[12:21] out of rome amen the prince that is to
[12:24] come
[12:25] what is he a pope a prince
[12:29] amongst the people that is to come
[12:31] they'll rise up a
[12:33] pharaoh who doesn't know joseph now you
[12:36] protestants say well now that's it but
[12:37] just a minute
[12:38] we find out that the protestants has an
[12:41] organization makes a confederation of
[12:43] churches an image to the beast and go
[12:44] right with them
[12:46] and we find out here that the jews are
[12:48] called in on this
[12:51] that's confederation yes sir and they
[12:53] agreed and the bible said they did
[12:56] and he makes a covenant with them in the
[12:58] midst of the
[12:59] uh 70th week hebrew the antichrist
[13:03] breaks his covenant with the jews thy
[13:05] people
[13:07] why now we read in revelations 11 that
[13:10] are sent at 11 you're coming on world
[13:12] wars 19 now
[13:13] that he will send his uh two prophets
[13:17] and they'll prophesy in that time and
[13:19] then they'll get angry at these prophets
[13:21] and actually kill them is that right
[13:23] and their dead bodies shall lay in the
[13:25] spiritual street called sodom again
[13:26] where our lord was crucified jerusalem
[13:29] is that right
[13:30] and they lay there for three days and
[13:32] nights and after three days and nights
[13:34] the spirit of life will come into them
[13:35] and they'll be raised up
[13:37] and going to glory the 10th part of the
[13:38] city failed at that time is that right
[13:41] see what is that in the middle of this
[13:44] last 70 years
[13:45] when the church fills up then the
[13:47] confederation the sleeping virgin
[13:49] methodist baptist presbyterian lukewarm
[13:51] pentecost
[13:53] all of them together with a
[13:54] confederation which have already got
[13:56] their big
[13:57] regime now and when they do they'll make
[14:00] a covenant
[14:01] that well now this new pope that we got
[14:03] now wants to bring
[14:04] all in can you see the things
[14:08] go together talk on it and bring them
[14:09] all in first time for hundreds and
[14:11] hundreds and hundreds of years
[14:13] a thousand years or two it's ever been
[14:15] done but now he's to bring him all in
[14:17] together
[14:18] and make a confederation in there the
[14:20] jews will accept it amen
[14:23] amen glory hallelujah praise be to our
[14:27] god
[14:28] list forever there you are
[14:32] my brother is just as simple as simple a
[14:34] little kid could see
[14:37] the confederation of bringing jewish and
[14:40] protestant and catholic together and
[14:44] remember
[14:44] what's these two prophets going to do
[14:46] when they come
[14:48] this beast this prince
[14:52] that shall scatter the power of the holy
[14:54] people what will he do
[14:55] he'll break his covenant with him after
[14:58] three and a half years
[14:59] he'll oust them our people think that's
[15:02] communism
[15:03] that's just because you the spirit of
[15:05] god hasn't dealt with yet
[15:07] it's not communism it's
[15:11] amen the religion said to be so close
[15:13] and deceive the very elected if possible
[15:15] jesus said so see we're in the last now
[15:18] these two prophets what will they do
[15:20] it's moses and elijah amen amen they'll
[15:23] rise on the scene
[15:24] amen they'll tell those jews their
[15:27] mistakes
[15:27] and out of that jewish bunch that's
[15:29] there now to be the 144 thousand
[15:32] god will call with these prophets
[15:35] what is it the spirit of elijah all for
[15:38] this gentile church we'll just continue
[15:40] right on into that jewish church
[15:43] go right on your call moses with him yes
[15:45] sir hallelujah
[15:48] you see it and he'll preach the same
[15:51] message of pentecost to those jews that
[15:54] they rejected the messiah
[15:55] hallelujah amen
[15:59] you see it it'll be the same pentecostal
[16:03] message as these jews will preach right
[16:05] over to them
[16:05] and they'll hate those jews so bad until
[16:08] they'll kill them
[16:09] and they were hated by all nations and
[16:12] in the midst of the week because if they
[16:14] had raised up a great powerful hundred
[16:16] and forty four thousand
[16:17] amen they had the holy ghost and brother
