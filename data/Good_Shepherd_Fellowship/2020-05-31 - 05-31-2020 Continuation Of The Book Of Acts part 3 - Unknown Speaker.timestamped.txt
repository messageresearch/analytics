[4:12] oh lordy no I have no friend like you if
[4:18] Heaven's not my home then Lord what will
[4:21] I do the Angels beckon me from Heaven's
[4:26] open door and I can feel at home in this
[4:31] world anymore they're all expecting me

[4:39] it up with Jesus many years ago

[5:42] I do the angel spectively from Heaven's
[5:47] open doors and I can feel at home in
[5:51] this world a man praise the Lord Amen
[6:01] Saints it's just been a week that we
[6:07] would never ever expect it so we just
[6:10] have
[6:11] I'm sure you all have a lot of Preppers
[6:13] on your heart this morning but of course
[6:16] we certainly want to remember the family
[6:21] George Floyd the man who passed away
[6:24] shouldn't have passed away but but when
[6:28] just want to remember his family we also
[6:31] on remember all of those that are
[6:33] grieving I also want to remember that
[6:35] all those that are upset and angry too
[6:39] but we also want to remember the those
[6:42] police officers too and you might think
[6:45] well why should we pray for them but you
[6:48] know God's way of looking at things
[6:51] I seem to remember somebody in the book
[6:53] of Acts call his name was Saul and he
[6:56] stood there and and when Stephen was
[6:58] stoned he hold they held the coats of
[7:01] those that actually killed Stephen and
[7:03] of course we know the story he was
[7:06] actually on his way to Damascus to
[7:07] arrest Christians who weren't doing
[7:10] anything wrong
[7:11] to bring them back to Jerusalem and then
[7:14] thrown many in jail and I believe many
[7:16] were killed and certainly God took that
[7:19] situation with that man and turned that
[7:21] around too so we just want to remember
[7:23] you know there's a group they have black
[7:28] lives matter but I want to say this
[7:32] morning the way the Lord looks that he
[7:33] says all lives matter so as we go to
[7:37] prayer you have special things in your
[7:40] heart we just want to remember all these
[7:42] things in prayer we just want to ask
[7:44] that my God's grace that
[7:47] peace could sweep over especially in the
[7:51] Twin Cities area and it just hasn't it's
[7:55] gonna have to take God and be able to do
[7:56] that so Amon let's bow our heads

[34:00] Amy
[34:05] praise the Lord
[34:08] thank you Father
[34:19] Saints I just wanted to say something Oh
[34:22] Lord you know as we began to sing that
[34:25] song in the presence of Jehovah I wasn't
[34:28] on the list today but I believe it was
[34:32] on his list there was the answer states
[34:34] of God for whatever situation that we're
[34:37] in smaller green
[34:40] the song says troubles vanish and our
[34:44] term ended in the presence of the king
[34:47] we just we just want to be in his
[34:50] presence this morning as Aaron's rod it
[34:53] was a dry old stick but when I went into
[34:55] its presence it came to life amen it
[34:58] brought forth fruit and so as we dwell
[35:01] in his presence will bring forth his
[35:05] fruit and we can take that presence with
[35:08] us wherever we go and it could cause
[35:12] troubles to vanish and hearts to be
[35:15] mended it's Jesus Christ and I just was
[35:18] thinking about as our brother was
[35:21] talking and praying how the scripture
[35:25] says I thank God upon every remembrance
[35:29] of you each and every one of you and I'm
[35:33] just so grateful to be your brother and
[35:39] I just say God richly bless each and
[35:43] every one of you I love you all and I
[35:46] just appreciate all of you so much and
[35:50] it's oh there's only one color that
[35:53] we're concerned about and it's it's
[35:55] blood-red his shed blood of Reason
[35:58] saints of God but I'm so grateful and
[36:02] I'm so thankful upon every remembrance
[36:03] of you and so amen as we're apart I just
[36:08] want you to continue to pray for me and
[36:11] I'll be praying for you too
[36:13] thank you thankful for brother Monty I
[36:15] know I've broken every rule that the
[36:17] governor said but I love my brother I
[36:22] love you and I just appreciate for the
[36:24] blotting let's just remember to pray for
[36:26] him in these times as the pastor amen
[36:30] that the Lord has a special
[36:33] a special thing for him to do being
[36:36] called into that ministry let's just
[36:38] remember him in prayer - god bless you
[36:41] a since there is I mean there is no way
[36:55] we can over emphasize of how much we are
[37:00] grateful to the Lord for happiness as a
[37:04] body every time time and time again he
[37:07] comes in in a very simple way he Benny
[37:11] Kate his presence among a saying and
[37:13] that is and that's all that matters
[37:16] you know what people saying what people
[37:19] think does not matter is what God is
[37:23] doing so we thank the Lord for
[37:25] everything that His grace is doing for
[37:28] us
[37:30] and during this time of lockdown short
[37:37] distance and everything we've been
[37:40] having our services this way and I'm
[37:43] telling you the Lord has been so mindful
[37:46] of us I mean he has come bad I was even
[37:49] thinking about Wednesday service even
[37:51] though the audio was a little bit rough
[37:54] I spoke to brother Prater and and just
[37:58] appreciate him fo for I'm standing in
[38:01] the gap to help us but I was thinking
[38:02] about it you know what is what is the
[38:05] odd that I mean we've been staring from
[38:08] the book of Acts and labral Peter cam
[38:10] right there reading from our chapter 13
[38:12] and I'm going to am stay continually in
[38:14] mind you know mine my series on the
[38:16] continuation of the book of ads and I
[38:19] was just thinking there as soon as I
[38:21] heard what he was reading from the I was
[38:24] just enough for me to know that you know
[38:26] God was in it all and you know once
[38:32] again we I mean it was it was beyond our
[38:35] control the technicians they did
[38:37] everything you know but prayer even
[38:40] invited some of his people to the church
[38:42] and they're also you know I was thinking
[38:45] about it and I just said lord I will be
[38:48] merciful if we will sit down and
[38:50] complain about the volume and and what
[38:53] of you I don't know what it is really
[38:56] the volume we need we need I mean we
[38:58] need a voice of God we need the Holy
[39:00] Spirit to be able to help us because
[39:02] it's just one word from God that is
[39:04] enough to change our life and you know
[39:08] and then sometimes as human we get first
[39:11] aid you know and we get mixed feeling
[39:14] you know I can't even get this thing I
[39:15] don't even know what's going on and we
[39:17] don't even know I mean the kind of work
[39:20] and effort that is put behind the scenes
[39:22] to have all of these things going on
[39:24] praise the Lord and I just I just pray
[39:27] that the law will be able to help us we
[39:29] have to be spiritual minded in such a
[39:32] time that we are living I mean things
[39:34] are happening the world is changing in
[39:36] such a way that if we are kind of man
[39:39] that we will never be able to catch
[39:42] with a lot of the changes around us I
[39:44] mean there are a lot of things that are
[39:45] happening you know the lead has been
[39:47] taken out of hell they are demon spirits
[39:49] that are streaming out true through the
[39:52] earth I mean in every way shape and form
[39:54] so if you are not prayer for if you are
[39:57] not you know keeping yourself in the
[40:00] presence of Jehovah if you are there -
[40:03] keeping yourself under the blood I'm
[40:04] telling you the devil is going to nail
[40:07] your face Neil your ears you know when
[40:09] the all your eyes and I mean he's just
[40:12] planning to do the most weakest thing
[40:14] that he can do because the scripture
[40:16] says he know his time is short
[40:18] amen and we also know after the seven
[40:22] injured message that time is normal you
[40:25] know so let's let's put importance on
[40:29] the things that is important whether the
[40:31] service is two minutes long if it is
[40:34] just two minutes I mean the light can
[40:37] shut off right now and you listening to
[40:39] me I mean your computer can go off and I
[40:42] mean also some things can happen who are
[40:45] you going to blame are you going to say
[40:47] I don't know what they're doing down
[40:48] there I mean that just a kind of way to
[40:50] behave we must be beyond that because I
[40:54] don't know how many of us gathered
[40:56] together in our home and pray 30 minutes
[40:59] before you even turn your computer on I
[41:03] mean just to sit down as a family hold
[41:06] one another hand and say Lord we are
[41:08] about to stream the service this morning
[41:09] just just bless bless the service Lord
[41:13] bless our brothers and sisters
[41:14] some people just wait for 10 I mean 11
[41:18] o'clock and then we turned a computer on
[41:19] the ready to get in the spirit there is
[41:21] no way we would get in the spirit that
[41:23] way if we are not praying we are not
[41:27] preparing ourselves the devil is he is
[41:30] against this very thing that we are
[41:31] doing we must know that we are using his
[41:35] media that's the fourth dimension
[41:36] science is the fourth dimension where
[41:42] Andrews will tell you there are hackers
[41:44] that are trying to break into our
[41:46] website he's at his house he's following
[41:48] the service you know and he's kicking
[41:50] hackers from from out of our website in
[41:53] all sorts of things
[41:55] I mean these brothers they are doing
[41:57] everything to be able to serve us so let
[42:01] us not sit down in our home and have
[42:03] attitude let us not allow the things
[42:06] that are happening in the street to give
[42:09] us attitude we are Christians we are
[42:14] believers and we must remain believers
[42:20] the Lord bless you this morning
[42:23] amen and once again like I said let's
[42:27] pray for the work at the church we just
[42:29] wanted to bring you that SHOP video so
[42:31] you can see there is no way you can get
[42:32] back in church now with all of those
[42:34] ladders
[42:35] you know there I don't want claim on a
[42:37] ladder to preach I want a pulpit to
[42:39] preach so let's pray for the Manning
[42:45] enemy you I mean you can just hold to
[42:47] that promise in the book of Psalm Lord
[42:49] unless you build the house the workers
[42:51] that builder ability in vain that was
[42:53] just a consolation to me this morning so
[42:56] Allah bless you let's stand on our feet
[42:58] First Samuel chapter 16 and we will read
[43:01] the Word of God I love you all this
[43:03] morning I mean you have to realize that
[43:08] I'm not coming against anybody that's a
[43:10] spirit out there that's what I'm
[43:13] blasting this morning so first samuel
[43:16] chapter 16 what mary go be self amen he
[43:22] is faithful he's a faithful God for
[43:27] samuel chapter 16 my goodness i'm hope
[43:32] raining this morning
[43:34] believing that the law will be able to
[43:36] to just help us and the Lord said unto
[43:41] Samuel am i in first Samir okay
[43:45] praise the Lord the Lord said unto
[43:48] Samuel how long will their moon for so
[43:52] seeing I have rejected him from reigning
[43:55] over Israel failed a horn with art and
[43:59] go I will send thee to Jesse the
[44:06] Bethlehem IDE
[44:09] I have provided me a king among his sons
[44:13] now this is a beautiful structure have
[44:16] your seat
[44:16] let's read it because I what there is
[44:19] there's a principle that I want for us
[44:21] to catch so I want to take my time I
[44:23] want you know I'm gonna give you the
[44:26] comfort of your seat I would do the
[44:28] standing for you and Sam you said how
[44:34] can I go
[44:35] if so year if he will kill me and the
[44:40] Lord said take and have fun with thee
[44:44] and say I am calm
[44:47] to sacrifice to the Lord what a great
[44:50] wisdom our god of wisdom you know he's
[44:53] he scenes that Sam you you know God is
[44:56] Ned you know he he just don't do things
[45:00] like us you know you would just think
[45:01] that well he's God
[45:03] I should Sam you be afraid of saw in a
[45:05] way he's a prophet you know he's you
[45:07] just stand down there if so I can't
[45:08] you're blind his eyes you know God don't
[45:11] work that way he works with a lot of
[45:12] wisdom you know he says well you take a
[45:15] knife or go and make a sacrifice and
[45:17] call Jessa verse 3 to the sacrifice and
[45:20] I will show thee what thou shalt do now
[45:24] seeing God is instructing Samuel but not
[45:28] giving him the full picture while you
[45:32] are walking in the light I will unfold I
[45:36] will show you what you would do I'm not
[45:38] telling you everything where Ben says
[45:40] God don't tell his prophets everything
[45:43] they have to walk by faith God don't
[45:46] tell his children everything there are
[45:48] things that we have to walk by faith
[45:51] aiming so let's just enjoy the Word of
[45:54] God name and I was show thee what thou
[45:56] shalt do ender sure I know it unto me
[45:59] him woo I mean on today which means God
[46:06] have not told him that yet you go by
[46:09] faith I will show you what you have to
[46:12] do and one that I have mean you will
[46:14] annoyed King and Samuel did that wish
[46:18] the Lord speak and came to Bethlehem and
[46:22] the address of the town tremble at his
[46:25] coming because you know every time the
[46:27] prophet comes to time he's bringing the
[46:29] word of the Lord and said come Adel
[46:32] pizza blade and he said peaceably I come
[46:35] to sacrifice unto the Lord
[46:38] sanctify yourself and come with me to
[46:42] the sacrifice and he sanctified Jesse
[46:45] and his sons and called them to the
[46:49] sacrifice for his Lord but now notice
[46:53] here let's note this Jesse and his sons
[46:55] but David was not there David was not
[47:03] there the scripture will let us know
[47:04] that and and the scripture says now this
[47:07] is what I want us to wash this principle
[47:09] the Bible says and it came to pass when
[47:12] they were come that he looked at ELab
[47:17] and said surely now who is looking this
[47:20] time Samuel he says surely the laws I
[47:25] noted is before him now so let me bring
[47:30] out you know a picture here so you will
[47:32] see when God to Samuel to do this he was
[47:36] afraid so there is an element of fear in
[47:39] him he want to do it quickly and get out
[47:42] of it so that element of fear is now
[47:47] moving him to see this this is the guy I
[47:51] want to do this quickly and get out of
[47:52] here
[47:53] praise the Lord now watch this other
[47:57] principle but the Lord said unto Samuel
[48:02] look net on his countenance all on the
[48:09] height of his stature because I have
[48:13] refused him for the law serious net as
[48:18] main theory for man looketh on the
[48:24] outward appearance but the Lord looketh
[48:29] on the heart now whose hat
[48:32] that's another principle we have to look
[48:35] at who's hot now you have to realize
[48:39] that right there God is dealing with
[48:41] Samuel so God is also telling Samuel
[48:45] dead I'm not going to use your eyes I'm
[48:48] going to convict your heart praise the
[48:54] Lord because Samuel is the one that God
[48:57] is dealing with now most of the time the
[49:01] scripture is stink too we think about it
[49:04] as the one that is going to be anointed
[49:08] it's true that God is also looking at
[49:11] the heart of the one that is going to be
[49:13] anointed but he's also dealing with the
[49:16] heart of the one that is doing the work
[49:22] because the Bible says here if you go
[49:26] back the Lord said unto Samuel look mad
[49:29] at his countenance don't use your eyes
[49:33] don't look at his height don't look at
[49:35] his size I'm going to deal with your
[49:38] heart when the man comes on the scene I
[49:42] would convict you that this is the man
[49:46] are we together and I think you know the
[49:50] rest of the story Amy and if you don't
[49:54] know you can read the rest of the story
[49:57] as chapter 1 let's go - I was tricked
[50:00] her in the book of Acts yeah we're going
[50:02] to read a little bit about the replacing
[50:04] of Judas that's the reason why I set a
[50:09] trap here and put you right in it now I
[50:12] get to I'm going to nail you this
[50:14] morning Amy oh man I just love when the
[50:21] people are pulling and you just get
[50:23] their attention
[50:26] praise the Lord as chapter 1 we continue
[50:30] in the book of Acts
[50:31] let's read verse 15 in those days Peters
[50:35] - up in the myth of the disciple and
[50:39] said the number of names together were
[50:45] about
[50:46] 120 men and Bradley's Peter speaking the
[50:50] scripture must me be must need have been
[50:55] fulfilled wish the Holy Ghost by the
[50:57] mouth of David speak before concerning
[51:01] Judas which was God to them that took
[51:08] Jesus for he was numbered with us and
[51:12] have attained part of this ministry now
[51:17] this man touches a feel wave the reward
[51:22] of iniquity and fall in hell on he
[51:30] brushed asunder in the mists and all his
[51:33] bowels gushed out and it is known unto
[51:37] all that dwelleth at jerusalem in so
[51:40] much as the field is called in the a
[51:43] proper tongue I kept Dhamma that is to
[51:49] say the feet of blood for it is written
[51:52] in the book of Sam let his habitation be
[51:57] desolate and let no man dwell it the aim
[52:01] in his bishop read let another take
[52:07] praise the Lord Amen wherefore of this
[52:19] man we have company with us all the time
[52:24] that the law jesus went in and out among
[52:29] us now so this is giving us a record
[52:32] that all of these men that they are
[52:34] going to choose they are not just men
[52:36] that have just come in they have been
[52:37] there all this one it's just that there
[52:40] were none number among the twelve you
[52:42] know so
[52:45] Luke is giving us this report as well
[52:48] you know that this man there has been
[52:51] all the time that the Lord Jesus went in
[52:53] and out among us beginning from the
[52:56] baptism of John see how far this man has
[52:59] been around you know from the bustling
[53:03] of John
[53:03] Anto onto that same day there he was
[53:08] taken up from us
[53:10] most must one be ordained to be a
[53:14] witness with us of his resurrection and
[53:18] and they appointed to Joseph called
[53:23] Bathsheba's who was so named Justus and
[53:29] Matthias and they prayed and said thou
[53:33] Lord we should know the heart of all men
[53:37] sure whether of these two thou have
[53:41] chosen that he may take part of this
[53:46] ministry and Apostleship from which
[53:49] Judas by transgression fell there he
[53:53] might go to his own place and give for
[54:01] the a lot and a lot of hair on my tears
[54:06] and he was numbered with the eleven a
[54:10] posture that way nursing the first
[54:13] chapter of the book of Acts there made a
[54:15] law our blessing upon His Word will go
[54:18] right into this subject I will start by
[54:22] saying I thought about it last night
[54:27] this morning as well I mean as I was
[54:30] meditating on the subject staring
[54:32] through the week I said to myself what
[54:35] could have happened if their postures
[54:38] just waited a little longer Pentecost
[54:42] was coming the Holy Ghost was coming
[54:47] they are making
[54:49] a divine choice without the Holy Ghost
[54:53] but brother branham is now going to show
[54:57] us how God will step back when the
[55:04] people make a choice God will be
[55:06] obligated just like he did to solve when
[55:10] the people choose salt as a king he told
[55:13] Samuel forget about it it is not you
[55:16] they have rejected it's me go and annoy
[55:19] Saul you know he told Simon you know you
[55:21] know it is all on the basis of this
[55:24] principle that brother Branham says God
[55:27] would support the choice of the majority
[55:30] it does not definitely mean that it is
[55:33] his choice but when the people choose to
[55:37] do that God would stand behind it and
[55:40] along the way he will vindicate that it
[55:44] was their choice and it was not his
[55:45] choice the same with Saul and David the
[55:48] sin we will see here with my tears and
[55:51] Paul praise the Lord
[55:52] but I was thinking about it and you know
[55:56] just like we're air from the scripture
[55:59] Haman's will always be him on there is
[56:01] something about our nature that is that
[56:05] God just enjoyed when he finds us to be
[56:08] the way we are once again Peter the
[56:11] father man the Bible see Peters to up
[56:14] that solve this problem he's always the
[56:18] forward guy he stood up Menem reveries
[56:23] man I can I can't imagine that Judas did
[56:26] this to us
[56:27] I've been reading the scripture I call
[56:30] into the scripture and I told you every
[56:32] time we come across daddy in the Bible I
[56:35] call into the scripture we must go back
[56:37] and find that structure it is our
[56:40] obligated Jesus says search the
[56:42] scripture so Peter were referring to
[56:46] Psalm chapter 69 you go back and read
[56:48] some chapter 69 you will see the promise
[56:51] that he was referring to there amen so
[56:56] and few our assignment in Psalm chapter
[56:58] follow one also he was he was one of
[57:02] those prophets
[57:03] is I India now so I'm just thinking
[57:06] about it is all my goodness Peter amen
[57:10] he stood up and wanted bread and she
[57:13] says let's solve this problem I just
[57:14] read in the book of Sam somebody have to
[57:17] take his place and all of these men
[57:19] being up there being with us they are
[57:21] all good man
[57:21] and the Bible says they prayed they did
[57:24] what they know was the right thing to do
[57:27] they did the best to the UM knowledge
[57:31] praise the Lord Amen I just feel like
[57:35] closing my Bible just leave you in
[57:38] suspense and you can just solve the rest
[57:41] [Laughter]
[57:43] praise the Lord you know just a little
[57:47] prayer meeting this morning we have had
[57:49] a helped me in a lot I mean to be able
[57:52] to break out of out of everything and
[57:54] just go right into his presence it's
[57:57] just a sweet thing to be in the presence
[57:58] of the Lord amen it sees all the human
[58:02] struggle you know all the human struggle
[58:05] when we get right into the presence of
[58:07] the Lord but let me show you something
[58:09] yes we continue to study the book of
[58:11] Acts let's go to Matthew chapter 1
[58:16] Matthew chapter 1 as we continue to
[58:19] study the book of Acts all praise the
[58:23] Lord amen Matthew chapter 1 verse 1 says
[58:31] the book of the generation of Jesus
[58:34] Christ the Son of David the son of
[58:39] Abraham
[58:40] there's we'll have the book starts with
[58:43] us then I won't want to take much of my
[58:46] time you know to be able to to go
[58:52] through all this verse 17 says so all
[58:55] the generations from Abraham to David
[58:57] are fourteen generations and from David
[59:00] until they carrying away into Babylon
[59:03] are fourteen generations and from the
[59:07] carrying away into Babylon unto Christ
[59:10] are fourteen generation praise the Lord
[59:13] and as you as you read
[59:16] much you introduction there was
[59:19] something I wanted we went over this
[59:21] before I can remember that but I just
[59:23] want to catch you on something here as
[59:25] you read my two introduction he comes in
[59:28] and he talks after talking about a
[59:30] generation the birth of Jesus Christ was
[59:33] on this why's he talks about Joseph and
[59:36] Mary and and and but you will realize
[59:39] that much you he's not going into into a
[59:48] lot of lot of other details here and
[59:51] then I mean he talks about you know the
[1:00:01] angel visit and then over into verse 2
[1:00:08] chapter two he starts wave now when
[1:00:14] Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in
[1:00:18] the days of Herod the King he talks
[1:00:22] about Herod the King behold they came
[1:00:24] wise men from the east to Jerusalem
[1:00:27] saying where is he that is born King of
[1:00:32] the Jews so where I want to grab you
[1:00:35] here my true introduction of Jesus
[1:00:38] Christ is to present him as a king so he
[1:00:45] started talking about David David was a
[1:00:47] king he started talking about Abraham in
[1:00:50] some sense Abraham was a king over his
[1:00:53] people even though the title of kingship
[1:00:57] was not given but he was a leader now so
[1:01:00] matthew is anointed he's honored this
[1:01:04] anointing to introduce Jesus Christ as
[1:01:06] the king praise the Lord
[1:01:10] mark chapter one
[1:01:26] the beginning of the gospel of Jesus
[1:01:29] Christ the Son of God as it is written
[1:01:35] in the prophet behold say my messenger
[1:01:39] before my face we shall prepare the way
[1:01:41] before thee the voice of the voice of
[1:01:47] one crying in the wilderness we know
[1:01:49] that this is John the Baptist and he
[1:01:51] comes with John the Baptist you know
[1:01:56] year John being the prophet and his
[1:01:59] ministry starting here right at the
[1:02:01] River Jordan you know he comes up
[1:02:04] talking about John in Candis Cayne and
[1:02:07] you know preaching at the River Jordan
[1:02:10] and he's saying behold the kingdom of
[1:02:13] heaven is a hint so he introduced John
[1:02:17] yeah as the priests with a ministry you
[1:02:23] know in a setting of this new tabernacle
[1:02:26] or this new kid 'm or this new you know
[1:02:29] other and then right into chapter 2
[1:02:35] chapter 2 you know john mack in his
[1:02:42] gospel here starts to speak out and
[1:02:44] pretty soon he goes right into the
[1:02:48] baptism of jesus so mark the anointing
[1:02:53] that is all mark is to present Jesus as
[1:02:56] a sacrifice because John is the priest
[1:03:01] and the sacrifice must be watch before
[1:03:05] it before it can be offered so Matthew
[1:03:11] is honored the anointing of the lion
[1:03:15] because lion is the king and mark is
[1:03:20] under the anointing of an ox because
[1:03:23] there's the sacrificial nature or the
[1:03:26] sacrificial anointing
[1:03:29] so right away he starts his introduction
[1:03:32] lay by the holy spirit to be able to go
[1:03:36] right to Jesus being watch before he
[1:03:39] goes right into his into his ministry
[1:03:44] praise the Lord
[1:03:46] Luke chapter 1 I know you you finish
[1:03:51] getting when I'm growing that's okay and
[1:03:52] relax
[1:03:54] I'm not never because I want you to get
[1:03:59] me so if you get me that's fine you mean
[1:04:02] now we see here a series loop now all of
[1:04:06] the mass anointing he's going to go into
[1:04:11] so much detail so much detail and he's
[1:04:16] going to bring different human
[1:04:18] characters into the birth of Jesus he
[1:04:23] was the one that said how Jesus grew in
[1:04:27] stature getting favor with God and man
[1:04:32] he's he's keeping the main part of Jesus
[1:04:37] when brother Branham says he hundred
[1:04:39] percent God and he's hundred percent man
[1:04:42] Luke is keeping that part he's showing
[1:04:44] us that this is a man talking about
[1:04:49] Jesus being in a captain to shop as a
[1:04:51] ball Luke is the one that is bringing up
[1:04:53] all of those him apart of Jesus not that
[1:04:58] man that ball growing to the time where
[1:05:01] he would get into his ministry
[1:05:02] so you see Luke in his presentation of
[1:05:06] his report of his gospel he having so
[1:05:10] much information that's not much you
[1:05:14] might you straight to the the the
[1:05:16] generation of Jesus Christ coming from
[1:05:18] Abraham the king I mean David going
[1:05:21] through the lineage and he's dealing
[1:05:23] with the kingship and he comes right in
[1:05:25] there and he says in a time of Herod the
[1:05:27] King King of the Jews
[1:05:30] that's the anointing his honor God and
[1:05:33] nor to him for that sin
[1:05:39] chapter one when John comes with his
[1:05:42] owner report he said in the beginning
[1:05:44] was the word he flew right back to the
[1:05:46] beginning where about him say his honor
[1:05:48] that Eagle anointing he can go right
[1:05:51] back to the beginning are we together so
[1:05:59] in the gust in in the book of us the
[1:06:02] reason why I'm bringing this out is
[1:06:04] because in the books of in the book of
[1:06:07] Acts we would get to see this anointing
[1:06:10] place out praise the Lord we will see
[1:06:17] this anointing the kingdom is now birth
[1:06:21] the king is taking part of the people's
[1:06:25] heart some of them will be killed they
[1:06:29] will be sacrificed they will be whipped
[1:06:32] but he will be using him as you'll be
[1:06:35] using common people and right in the
[1:06:40] midst of their poor will rise up with
[1:06:43] great understanding in Revelation so
[1:06:46] it's all the force anointing playing out
[1:06:48] right in the book of Acts because when
[1:06:55] we talk about the book of Acts and we
[1:06:57] talked about the Holy Ghost among the
[1:07:01] people sometimes we just think in the
[1:07:03] Eagles anointing we just won the
[1:07:05] miracles we won the healing
[1:07:07] we won't order that we don't look at the
[1:07:08] sacrifice Peter and John being whipped
[1:07:15] they are partaking of his suffering are
[1:07:23] we together praise the Lord
[1:07:26] Revelation chapter 4 but branches this
[1:07:30] year the mercy seat nothing could come
[1:07:34] anywhere around around it without
[1:07:38] crossing those tribes he's talking about
[1:07:41] the mercy seat in the Old Testament how
[1:07:44] when the tabernacle was Bill the twelve
[1:07:47] tribes were divided on the fourth side
[1:07:50] of the tabernacle so he's bringing their
[1:07:52] over now to
[1:07:53] a book of arts that's so that's what
[1:07:55] he's going crossing what the lion
[1:07:59] crossing the man he says nothing nothing
[1:08:03] who come anywhere around the mercy
[1:08:08] without dealing with one of these
[1:08:10] anointing prays alone
[1:08:14] no no wish no no way the enemy come
[1:08:18] God has a protection on one side if he
[1:08:23] does not use the anointing of a preacher
[1:08:26] he would bless a man with wisdom to be
[1:08:29] able to deal with their situation so no
[1:08:32] way how the enemy comes if he comes as a
[1:08:35] Scarlet God would give us the right word
[1:08:38] in the scripture to stay if he comes as
[1:08:40] you know whichever way he comes us you
[1:08:44] know we they are noting this year to D
[1:08:47] him so brother Branham says there is no
[1:08:48] way he can come with our cross in one of
[1:08:51] them he had to cross the lion crossing
[1:08:53] the man's intelligence the intelligence
[1:08:55] of a man crossing the the work hers as
[1:09:00] an ox or crossing the ego the the
[1:09:06] swiftness of eight seed the heaven the
[1:09:10] earth in between and all around you see
[1:09:16] they will gather so this anointing are
[1:09:21] represented in heaven they are
[1:09:25] represented in heavenly places this
[1:09:29] anointing is also represented on earth
[1:09:34] that is the reason why the the the
[1:09:39] minister in the book of us are lacking
[1:09:41] on two angels with Flemish walls because
[1:09:48] they are there to God the people they
[1:09:51] are there told to protect the people or
[1:09:54] protect the church or protect emergency
[1:09:59] praise the Lord
[1:10:00] and that is the reason why if a man does
[1:10:04] that with a selfish desire he ruins the
[1:10:07] plain of God
[1:10:09] amen are we together so he says the
[1:10:16] heavens the earth in between in an order
[1:10:18] round you see we're gathered and above
[1:10:21] it was the pillar of fire brother not in
[1:10:26] touchdown mercy without the approach
[1:10:31] without meeting one of these praise the
[1:10:37] Lord
[1:10:38] that's the reason why God gave ministry
[1:10:41] to the church that's the reason why God
[1:10:44] gave a husband to a family his work is
[1:10:49] to protect provide for seeds that's
[1:10:57] God's order are we together now he says
[1:11:02] him the gospel guy to back up the book
[1:11:08] of Acts that was wrote the gospel is a
[1:11:13] guide to back up the book of Acts and
[1:11:16] that is the reason why we show these
[1:11:20] four anointings in the beginning in the
[1:11:22] introduction honor honor the anointing
[1:11:26] that all these apostles were when they
[1:11:28] gear because the book of us is coming
[1:11:31] God would start dealing people and these
[1:11:34] four anointings is going to be around
[1:11:37] the book on the days of Pentecost when
[1:11:43] the Holy Ghost came it was Christ the
[1:11:46] King taking the throne on the hearts of
[1:11:49] his people so the Holy Ghost the birth
[1:11:56] of the Holy Ghost is God taking his true
[1:12:00] his resident in your heart because he's
[1:12:02] king of kings and Lord of lords he don't
[1:12:08] want no man sitting on your heart he
[1:12:11] don't want a man idea sitting on your
[1:12:13] heart he want to be Lord of your life
[1:12:15] and that's the reason why the book of us
[1:12:21] game with the day of Pentecost and I
[1:12:29] mean we can just go and then 3,000 was
[1:12:32] added in the midst of those 3,000 and
[1:12:34] miss motors who came in and all of that
[1:12:36] we would deal with that as we go along
[1:12:38] but the gospel God to back of the book
[1:12:44] of Acts water rose now I heard a great
[1:12:47] teacher bourbon I'm talking years is now
[1:12:49] long ago a great man fine man met met
[1:12:53] him shook his hand a fine brother he
[1:12:56] said but the book of Acts of the
[1:12:58] Apostles
[1:13:00] is just a framework for the church hmm
[1:13:03] in other words he had a framework out
[1:13:06] here when the book of the the ass of the
[1:13:12] Apostle was inside and this gospel the
[1:13:18] framework to hold it together and
[1:13:21] protect it that is the reason why Luke
[1:13:28] started with his introduction the things
[1:13:31] that Jesus began to do he's continuing
[1:13:36] the things that he began to do in his
[1:13:39] ministry
[1:13:40] he's now continuing in the form of the
[1:13:44] Holy Ghost so it's a continuation see
[1:13:52] how the mind of a man can do anything I
[1:13:56] did taught the same thing if it wasn't
[1:13:59] for him where Bam's is if God did not
[1:14:02] happen he would be thinking the same
[1:14:03] thing
[1:14:03] he says the framework Pentecost wasn't
[1:14:07] the framework of the gospel the four
[1:14:10] gospel are the framework to back
[1:14:14] Pentecost after they had this framework
[1:14:19] of Pentecost be come into existence he
[1:14:26] say is that right which was Ruth first
[1:14:28] he says the book of Acts of the Apostles
[1:14:34] the book of ads or the the gospel of the
[1:14:36] Apostles I mean the Apostle he says
[1:14:39] Jesus walked along doing the work and
[1:14:42] forgetting what who come and Matthew
[1:14:45] Mark Luke and John then four guys comes
[1:14:48] and was writing everything they'd seen
[1:14:53] coming to pass
[1:14:54] telling it just like it is how it was
[1:14:58] going to happen what was going to take
[1:15:01] place then all at once they frame it
[1:15:07] around and year it comes a me and
[1:15:10] Matthew Mark Luke and John is the
[1:15:14] framework all the God work that protects
[1:15:19] the mean temple the truth the Pentecost
[1:15:23] of blessing because over there in John
[1:15:26] he promised the comforter in the Book of
[1:15:29] Luke he says that when when when the
[1:15:33] Holy Spirit comes you will get
[1:15:35] understanding of these things that are
[1:15:37] that I'm telling you that's why he spoke
[1:15:39] to those men on a road of a Meijer you
[1:15:41] know and in all the promises there so
[1:15:43] what was he pointing tone he was
[1:15:45] pointing to the Pentecostal blessing
[1:15:48] there in John he says out of your belly
[1:15:51] will flow rivers of water this he spoke
[1:15:54] of the Holy Ghost to come when even he
[1:15:57] resurrected at the end of the book of
[1:15:59] John the Bible said when he appeared
[1:16:01] unto them he said peace be on to you
[1:16:04] Shalom he says a receive here the Holy
[1:16:08] Ghost he pointing them to the
[1:16:10] pentecostal blessing giving the
[1:16:14] protection that this thing is going to
[1:16:16] come praise the Lord
[1:16:18] oh man is yes it just so wonderful point
[1:16:26] you to the Pentecostal blessing amen
[1:16:31] so we see here how that you know God use
[1:16:37] all of these men in their report I mean
[1:16:41] give them different anointing that's the
[1:16:43] reason why the kind of mind can jump
[1:16:45] right in there and says all my
[1:16:47] to you is contract dating Luke law they
[1:16:49] are not contract getting each one of
[1:16:51] them are on a different anointing they
[1:16:53] are doing different work they are
[1:16:54] presenting a Christ honor dia anointing
[1:17:04] what a beautiful thing here
[1:17:07] amen and here is it the Pentecostal
[1:17:12] blessing has not come I love the way
[1:17:17] brother Branham say this in Fr the Lord
[1:17:21] can just help us to just stay right in
[1:17:23] there you will enjoy there let's look at
[1:17:26] the word made flesh in in trip report
[1:17:29] he's coming to get on this thing here
[1:17:34] let's look at their come to get to our
[1:17:41] so Janelle he said Paul was net an
[1:17:48] apostille I call him to the twelve Paul
[1:17:54] was not an apostle calling to the two of
[1:17:59] Galatians chapter 1 let's read there
[1:18:04] let's read the Galatians chapter 1 Paul
[1:18:07] himself testified amen
[1:18:11] of death Colossians chapter 1 that
[1:18:16] should be verse 1 praise the Lord
[1:18:25] okay yeah
[1:18:28] poor Donna pasta net of man neither by
[1:18:33] man but by jesus christ and god the
[1:18:41] father who raised him from the dead so
[1:18:45] we realize here they are poor a pasta
[1:18:50] shape it was now voted upon
[1:18:53] i mean but we have to remember the other
[1:18:59] apostles like matthew he was behind his
[1:19:04] tax collected eggs counting money when
[1:19:07] jesus passed by they make eye contact
[1:19:10] and he said follow me Jesus called him
[1:19:15] in he left his his his you know tax
[1:19:20] collecting working he went into the
[1:19:24] ministry
[1:19:24] Peter the scene and in all of this man
[1:19:27] they got a call from God from the Lord
[1:19:31] Jesus the same rapport he got a call but
[1:19:34] this time it was not in a body form
[1:19:37] Jesus met him on the road of Damascus
[1:19:43] praise the Lord Jesus met him on the row
[1:19:47] of Damascus but his calling was not
[1:19:52] liked at all because the two of their
[1:19:54] calling was in the fleshly Ministry of
[1:19:57] Jesus Christ Paul Collin was in the
[1:20:00] spiritual ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:20:01] through the form of the Holy Ghost let's
[1:20:04] continue to read him he says Paul was
[1:20:06] not an apostle according to the twelve
[1:20:09] but did you ever notice they choose
[1:20:14] materials I believe it was to take Judas
[1:20:20] place and that's what means done never
[1:20:28] heard no more of him but God choose Paul
[1:20:33] to take his place
[1:20:35] you see and look what Paul did now this
[1:20:41] is what I want to grab you
[1:20:42] attention he said see to assure the
[1:20:46] difference between the choosing of man
[1:20:49] and the choosing of God amen
[1:20:55] watch this also now and and that makes
[1:20:58] he says it gave me a lot of Grace in
[1:21:02] Mahon butter bread I'm saying this now
[1:21:04] looking at what took place in the book
[1:21:08] of God he said it gave me a lot of grace
[1:21:10] in my heart to wash things even errors
[1:21:14] and so far so it shows that when we make
[1:21:20] choices and we and and we come to
[1:21:23] realize that we make arrow is stretched
[1:21:25] your grace because let Peter and those
[1:21:31] men right there they're making a choice
[1:21:34] on divine scripture Peter is taking the
[1:21:37] scripture he's taking the the book of
[1:21:40] Sam he's proving it is written in the
[1:21:42] book of Sam and not a man should take
[1:21:44] his place he's bringing all these coats
[1:21:47] to prove his point and the Bible says
[1:21:50] after he did that the brothers were
[1:21:52] convinced they all went to praying they
[1:21:56] were not they were not just doing things
[1:21:58] they were trying to follow the scripture
[1:22:02] in as much as the norm but brother
[1:22:05] Branham said he says he says and then
[1:22:11] give me a lot of Grace in my heart to
[1:22:15] wash things in arrow in a sense verbatim
[1:22:18] is saying even if I make arrow a giving
[1:22:21] grace in my heart to know that I was
[1:22:24] trying to do everything according to the
[1:22:26] scripture praise the Lord
[1:22:31] I mean people that want to find our
[1:22:35] brother brems share this and where bands
[1:22:37] say this and ever came to point here
[1:22:39] that pages from your Bible because this
[1:22:41] man they made an error
[1:22:43] the first thing there was that Jesus
[1:22:46] told them to wait until tyree until he
[1:22:50] received power the power was the Holy
[1:22:52] Ghost to instruct them but they did this
[1:22:54] before even the whole
[1:22:56] goes king that is the first thing that
[1:23:02] made this choice even before they
[1:23:04] received the Holy Ghost Oh what can we
[1:23:11] accept ourself to be humans that grace
[1:23:15] her safe
[1:23:16] what should we think that we are angels
[1:23:18] and we are call never to make mistakes
[1:23:22] grace has saved us that when we make
[1:23:25] mistakes we can come back to that same
[1:23:27] grace and say how mercy he says it gave
[1:23:33] me lot of grace in my heart two worst
[1:23:37] things it gave me a lot of grace Emma
[1:23:41] had to wash people Oh
[1:23:53] just one there to suck down let me drink
[1:23:54] water I may go down when I drink but I
[1:24:02] want you to think about it
[1:24:04] when we can't find grace in our hand
[1:24:06] when we can realize that grace have
[1:24:09] brought us to where we are and we are
[1:24:13] just so easy to kick other people out of
[1:24:15] the kingdom we so easy to condemn other
[1:24:18] people because we are just in their
[1:24:20] self-righteous mind we're Banshee it
[1:24:23] gave me a lot of grace he says seeing
[1:24:26] this it gave me a lot of grace in my
[1:24:29] heart to wash things and arrows and so
[1:24:35] far that's the reason why we we
[1:24:40] appreciate this man ministry because
[1:24:44] when brother Branham see it in the word
[1:24:45] he admits to it it gave me a lot of
[1:24:52] grace seeing this
[1:24:54] it gave me grace to be patient with
[1:24:57] people when a brother comes up and
[1:25:02] preaches salmon and then I mean he just
[1:25:04] get the scripture makes why come there
[1:25:07] and says you know what it's a wrong
[1:25:09] spirit you you said John when it's
[1:25:11] supposed to be peated give grace let's
[1:25:15] people grow now the problem there is
[1:25:20] that if the man is arrogant about it
[1:25:22] then we know it's a wrong spirit but we
[1:25:32] give grace sometimes the preacher was
[1:25:36] sit back he would see things and then

[1:29:11] we can believe that he will keep his
[1:29:14] word every way every step of the way
[1:29:17] amen but this this was this was a major
[1:29:21] thing major thing major thing
[1:29:23] in the beginning of the church and one
[1:29:28] thing also that I was that was principal
[1:29:30] these guys that were not using their
[1:29:32] mind we're not using their idea they
[1:29:34] were proving things by the scripture
[1:29:38] they were flipping through the scripture
[1:29:42] Jesus have told them to search the
[1:29:44] scripture I believe Peter was reading
[1:29:48] the book of Sam and when he came across
[1:29:51] that let's read Psalm chapter 69 I hope
[1:29:54] I'm I'm right with that I think so I
[1:29:57] read it last night
[1:29:59] let's go by let's just read Psalm
[1:30:01] chapter 69 it's just one of the one of
[1:30:10] those timeless and I was reading and I
[1:30:12] mean the picture is just so
[1:30:33] okay read from verse 20 let's look at
[1:30:36] year
[1:30:36] that's the Spirit of Christ speaking out
[1:30:38] here reproach has has broken my heart
[1:30:42] and I'm full of heaviness Jesus right in
[1:30:46] that I mean David prophesied Jesus right
[1:30:49] there in the Garden of Gethsemane he
[1:30:51] says I look for some to take pity and
[1:30:55] there was none other those disciples
[1:30:57] sleeping pray with me one hour they are
[1:31:00] all sleeping and the comforters but I
[1:31:03] found that okay let's just go ahead now
[1:31:06] they give me also God for meat and in
[1:31:11] matters they gave me vinegar to drink
[1:31:17] let their tables become a snail before
[1:31:20] them and that wish to have been for
[1:31:27] their welfare let it become a trap let
[1:31:31] let their eyes be docking speaking about
[1:31:35] those Jews his coming was supposed to be
[1:31:38] for their welfare let the eyes be
[1:31:43] docking that they see not and the layers
[1:31:47] continue to shake pour out that
[1:31:50] indignation upon them and let the
[1:31:53] rightful anger take hold of them let
[1:31:58] their habitation be desolate and let non
[1:32:02] dirt in the attaint and he's going on
[1:32:06] and on and on
[1:32:19] so you see David right here on the on
[1:32:25] the dis anointing he goes ahead and then
[1:32:34] for the persecute him whom thou hast met
[1:32:37] him and did any talk to grieve of those
[1:32:41] whom thou has wounded and iniquity unto
[1:32:45] the iniquity and let him not come into
[1:32:48] thy righteousness let them be blotted
[1:32:52] out of the book of the living and net be
[1:32:55] reading with the righteous just on and
[1:32:59] on on and on you go back to the
[1:33:00] beginning you see there but this was
[1:33:03] were David I mean Peter was reading true
[1:33:06] I mean just read him flipping through
[1:33:08] the Sun you know and looking at the
[1:33:10] scripture you go to Psalms chapter 4 the
[1:33:12] one also some of the prophecy is right
[1:33:15] there and I think someone 100 something
[1:33:19] also I was telling there last night and
[1:33:22] but you realize him that they are not
[1:33:26] just they are not just looking this is
[1:33:31] net on the ground of favoritism they are
[1:33:36] trying to do everything to stay in line
[1:33:38] with the Word of God they have these two
[1:33:44] men after looking at everything and
[1:33:46] looking at the repetition of this men of
[1:33:49] all the men's that were they the broad
[1:33:52] is two guys for justice and and my tears
[1:33:58] I mean just for the two men that you
[1:34:01] could find that are fit in that place
[1:34:04] and that is now a favorite hazing it's
[1:34:08] not on tribal lines it's not on national
[1:34:10] line they are using the scripture they
[1:34:15] are doing their best because they want
[1:34:17] God to be in this thing
[1:34:19] praise the Lord they are doing their
[1:34:23] best oh my goodness let me see you
[1:34:35] see what blood-brain says here Hebrew
[1:34:39] chapter 3 he says when Judah fell by
[1:34:45] transgression by the loss of money and
[1:34:48] the pride of life he fell from grace and
[1:34:53] went to his place and the disciple said
[1:34:56] there must be 12 he says in the church
[1:35:05] with all of his dignity to show you what
[1:35:11] the church is with all of his dignity
[1:35:15] and all of his power is still a million
[1:35:20] my shot at it's very best that's what we
[1:35:29] need a grist of God we can we can put
[1:35:35] our hands with coats
[1:35:36] brother and said a brother and said that
[1:35:38] the Bible said a brother
[1:35:39] we are male your minds if God don't help
[1:35:42] us
[1:35:53] that's that's the reason why I you know
[1:35:55] I don't I don't stop people from coming
[1:35:57] to meet me and discussing subject you
[1:35:59] know I'm telling me how you feel and
[1:36:02] what we should do and you know what you
[1:36:04] think is best in them and in order there
[1:36:06] but we have to pray about it you have to
[1:36:11] pray you know sometimes we all like to
[1:36:18] be that one sheep you know the 99 must
[1:36:22] be left and only you but sometimes you
[1:36:29] must get in the 99 and wait for the one
[1:36:32] to be God because if you come to service
[1:36:37] and the service don't speak to you or
[1:36:39] the song leader I don't know why he was
[1:36:41] singing there and this they're just in

[1:40:45] with the twelve with the eleven which
[1:40:48] made up the twelve he did not do one
[1:40:51] thing now it does not miss that he
[1:40:54] backsliding but the thing about it there
[1:40:58] is that God that's that's where
[1:41:01] Birmingham is drawing it from the Holy
[1:41:04] Spirit didnêt bring up things materials
[1:41:08] there what what he what he knew he could
[1:41:10] do but Holy Spirit did not highlighted
[1:41:18] on things that he did just so he can
[1:41:21] bring us to this place to realize that
[1:41:25] the man for the job
[1:41:26] was Paul and Bob Arum says how can you
[1:41:31] think about let just read this before we

[1:42:02] time his name was ever mentioned in the
[1:42:04] scripture that was the choice that the
[1:42:09] church making his choice he says and
[1:42:13] they taught he's a gentleman no doubt oh
[1:42:15] we love the way he carried himself his
[1:42:18] necktie is always straight he's a
[1:42:20] wonderful man he's a scarlet he's smart
[1:42:23] he's educated and I was reading some
[1:42:26] commentary and I was with brother Brahim
[1:42:27] saying this thing that was a very thing
[1:42:29] just commentary said that my tears was a
[1:42:31] scarlet you know so a scholar for him to
[1:42:35] recognize Jesus ministry it was it was
[1:42:40] it was it was attracted to this disciple
[1:42:42] this man was a scarlet he knew the straw
[1:42:45] just like Nicodemus so for him for him
[1:42:50] being a scour to leave the sealing gas
[1:42:53] and be following this disciple to all
[1:42:55] their house meeting it will appeal it
[1:42:57] appealed to the disciple that this man
[1:43:00] is an honorable man
[1:43:02] or not not somebody like Jairus what
[1:43:05] would come to the evening Saracen in the
[1:43:07] morning he goes to the synagogue
[1:43:10] until his daughter died before he really
[1:43:13] decided to take a stand but this man was
[1:43:17] an honorable man he was a scarlet he
[1:43:19] knew the Lord when he saw him when he
[1:43:22] when he told him this is the sign of the
[1:43:24] Messiah he just went to one meeting and
[1:43:27] he saw Jesus calling people by name he
[1:43:29] said my goodness this is what we've been
[1:43:32] reading this is what we've been studying
[1:43:34] this is the word right there he left he
[1:43:38] left the Sanhedrin Council he started
[1:43:41] following these disciples they were
[1:43:43] meeting at the lake he was there he
[1:43:46] didn't care what kind of I said about
[1:43:48] him he was an honorable man amen he's a
[1:43:55] wonderful person he would take the place
[1:43:58] of Judas and be one of us the Bible said
[1:44:02] from the from the baptism of John for
[1:44:05] the time Jesus ascended this man they
[1:44:08] were there
[1:44:09] these are the kind of a man I was not
[1:44:11] missing service they were not so busy
[1:44:13] with their business meeting that a
[1:44:15] Quaker every time they were meeting they
[1:44:17] would make sure they'd be there on time
[1:44:18] man that are honorable that's what
[1:44:23] that's what we have been taught by the
[1:44:25] scripture to look for oh but you just
[1:44:28] see something yeah this will blow your
[1:44:30] mind but you know God sometimes I love
[1:44:34] the advances God sometimes makes to our
[1:44:37] opinion some of the most foolish choice
[1:44:40] that's that's what our opinion would be
[1:44:42] he says now God seen a little hook no
[1:44:45] Jews just as full of tempo oh my he's
[1:44:53] leaving the Honorable man in his career
[1:44:55] for a man with temple my good night is
[1:44:58] talking about his Christian love for
[1:45:00] just cracking his teeth you know give me
[1:45:03] one minute let me see something
[1:45:05] I need a people I can like these guys up
[1:45:13] God's choice
[1:45:15] a man of temper he says oh my goodness
[1:45:18] me praise the Lord he meant no one ago
[1:45:25] had to blind his eyes first before
[1:45:27] before because I mean what were your

[1:45:33] what would temper do for poor he want to
[1:45:37] go and arrest those Kristen he already
[1:45:38] blind so what would his temper do God
[1:45:40] has to blind him bring him in a most
[1:45:43] horrible state for him to seek God get
[1:45:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that he
[1:45:49] could have patience he could have such a
[1:45:54] heart when he saw feldman in jail you
[1:45:59] know as I said I'll send you back to
[1:46:00] your to your master or an insolence when
[1:46:03] he saw in jail he could have patience he
[1:46:07] got there to the Corinthian church and
[1:46:09] saw that this order but he still have
[1:46:11] patience God took that temper away
[1:46:16] that's why the Holy Ghost would do a
[1:46:19] mayor for up-tempo with with his
[1:46:22] off setting aside where Brandon just
[1:46:27] come up with all of these things he got
[1:46:30] a hook nose and his mouth twisted when

[1:46:44] twisted and his loss hanging away my
[1:46:49] goodness I don't know where he get these
[1:46:51] things from but it's just edify us when

[1:47:00] choice praise Allah oh man
[1:47:06] praise the Lord my goodness I will go
[1:47:13] down in there and arrest every one of
[1:47:15] them talking with his mouth twisted now

[1:47:23] his body but bird benches that was God's
[1:47:27] choice amen the rest of them the church
[1:47:33] the man they took the scholar they took
[1:47:34] the diplomat you know but God's choice
[1:47:37] was different he says see you don't know
[1:47:40] who's that at the altar now he's getting
[1:47:44] our attention when you see the man
[1:47:46] weeping or you see a woman crying out to
[1:47:50] God you don't know who is a daughter
[1:47:52] sometimes we sit in the pew and we're
[1:47:54] just looking over our shoulder to be
[1:47:56] judging people you don't know who is
[1:47:58] that person you don't know where they
[1:48:02] have been and you don't know what God is
[1:48:06] doing in their life a person standing up
[1:48:12] and testifying you don't know where they
[1:48:14] have been sit down with chewing gum and
[1:48:19] your mama you not even supposed to be
[1:48:21] chewing in church cracking gums and yes
[1:48:27] your mind is just all over that place
[1:48:33] he says you don't know that person at
[1:48:35] the altar amen you know I was reading
[1:48:43] this I'm telling you but I'm talking all
[1:48:46] of this and you know he talking about
[1:48:50] his ear broke down ski eyes skinned up I
[1:48:57] was just thinking in my mind what if a
[1:49:00] man comes to church you know or a woman
[1:49:04] they have all of these Ryan years they
[1:49:07] have both their ears because they were I
[1:49:09] mean they they're they were honoring
[1:49:10] wrong influence and God is dealing with
[1:49:12] you have what will be your attitude what
[1:49:16] would be your attitude you could sit
[1:49:20] right in the presence of God and be so
[1:49:25] judgmental because that person come with
[1:49:29] you know with the hanging ears but
[1:49:32] brother Brennan says you don't know that
[1:49:34] person you don't know what God is doing
[1:49:36] in your life for God's sake the best you
[1:49:42] can do is by your health and prayed
[1:49:52] that's the reason why we don't we don't
[1:49:54] even give them a chance because we see
[1:50:00] their hair all green or blue over we
[1:50:02] just we just send them in we just let
[1:50:05] the fire on them we just take the match
[1:50:09] and just let fire on them that let them
[1:50:11] just burn
[1:50:12] we don't even give them a chance
[1:50:30] but you don't know who that is you just
[1:50:35] cast your law that's all
[1:50:36] give give him the word you don't know
[1:50:41] who is there
[1:50:42] just cast you a lot give him the word
[1:50:46] just say God bless you see what how they
[1:50:49] will respond just say God bless you see
