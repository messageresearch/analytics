we we have a special meeting with brother Joel Green from North Carolina he will be here on the weekend of the 21st and the 22nd yeah that's that's the flyer so we will pray that and put that back there and we remind ourself uh uh so we will remind ourself as we as we go get close to the day but it's a Saturday night and it's Sunday morning praise the Lord and uh the Lord bless you all amen amen Genesis chapter 40 tonight let's read uh let's read verse one Genesis chapter 40 let's read verse one praise the Lord and it came to pass after these things did you remember that phrase that's why we spoke on Sunday after these things that's uh I'm I'm trying to wake up our curiosity after these things after what thing so whenever we read there you have to know we going back to read in the next chapter I'm going to bring a series of after these things to you so just just just be ready for it and it came to pass after these things after War think that the buckler of the king of Egypt and his Baker have offended their lord the king of Egypt and Pharaoh was wough against two of his officers against the chief bulo and against the chief of the Bakers praise the Lord Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 praise the Lord Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door though I will come in to him and will s with him and he with me let's pray together Lord Jesus we pray father that Lord you just come bless your word tonight Lord and Lord we trust that the holy spirit will just take intal thoughts and minister to us tonight let something be said that would draw us closer to you something Lord father God through the power of the holy spirit that will rebuke the enemy father and Lord God give us Grace to walk closer to you we love you tonight we pray father Lord for all all of the saints that couldn't make the service tonight Lord and and those that are streaming in oh god father we commit them in their in your hands Lord and ask that you bless them too we love you and we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat on U Sunday we had we had a uh communion service and in the morning we spoke a little bit about communion and Tiding because we were looking there in Genesis chapter 15 and uh and the Bible says after these things and the Lord appeared unto Abraham in a vision saying I'm your your shed and your exceeding and great reward praise the Lord and uh uh so we went back to see what happened before God visited Abraham there way and we realized that it was when Abraham had just returned back from uh uh the the the slaughtered of the king he just came back from redeeming his brother lot and uh uh so and we we were just uh uh trying to uh uh appre appreciate that as we talk about the ministry of reconciliation we also talk about uh Redemption you know Abraham was involved in Redemption and that will bring God on the sin every time praise the Lord amen it will bring God on the SC every time because there that's uh that's that's God's work there is only one mediator between man and God that's the man Christ Jesus amen praise the Lord so whenever you step to do that work God will come he will come he will step in your body you know whenever your your your your purpose your approach is to reconcile and uh sometimes we don't go about it the right way but you know God knowing the intention of our heart will give us Grace amen so tonight we want to we want to go in that same direction tonight but what I want for us to look at is that we want to look at Communion we want to look at communion with him praise the Lord we'll go back a little bit to what we talk about on on on Sunday uh uh and and and bring uh you know and and just be able to trust the Lord that it will uh he will help us to bring it out a little more clearer than it was because when you when you look at what happened in Genesis chapter 15 praise the Lord if if you read many scholars believe that uh you know that uh meic or meic whichever way uh we can rightly pronounce it many scholars believe that he was a priest okay they somehow believe some of them believe that you know well it was a priest at that time that was in that area and they have and and some you know speak about you know the prefigure of Jesus Christ and and all of that but this is what I want for us to watch as we as we as we look into into that subject tonight because what we want to talk about we want to talk about communing with God how we can commune with God like we said on Sunday uh there is a spiritual communion amen but the spiritual communion do not uh uh uh stop us from uh from participating in the ordinance that was given to the church whatever we did on Sunday we were fulfilling the scripture when Jesus says as often as you do this you do this in remembrance of me amen so we were remembering the Lord as we as we approach the Lord table on Sunday but as we will see tonight we trust that the Lord will give us Grace amen he will give us Grace and we will be able to look into this as we go along but brother BR here in the message door to the heart he will take that scripture we read in Revelation chap 3 20 he will says I stand and knock at the door and if any man will open God doesn't pull your heart open he just knock and you have to open up praise the Lord amen he just knocked and you have to open it up I stand and KN and if any man will hear my voice and open I will will come in and soup with him and he with me now soing souping in the Old Testament all in their Oriental days of the Lord visit on Earth was communing praise the Lord amen so you see right here uh uh in uh in in in uh laition age God is is going to restore true communion to the church this is the only age that was that was invited today amen this is the only age that God says if you open unto me I will come into you and commune with you praise the Lord so truth communion be uh beside what catholism has introduced to the church All Through the Ages and and all what the reformers has done and all what the restoration of the gift has done God was going to have a people where he would bring truth communion a people that will respect the La Table and the people that will not only stop at the Lost table but they will have communion with God every day amen amen amen praise the Lord amen so so he says here and uh I will come in and have communion with him sit down and talk things over right praise the Lord if you are not talking things over with the Lord you're not having communion righten praise the Lord amen amen amen just a little talk with Jesus tell him all about my trouble and also would let he tell you also how he feels about your trouble amen are we together come in and we'll have communion with him sit down and talk things over don't you want him to do that with you praise the Lord do you really want the Lord come in and talk things over with you not only taking what the preacher says on now but what the Holy Ghost is saying speaking to your heart recognizing the small stay verse when he speaks to you amen that's truth communion praise the Lord if you feel a stify life that brings you to the table to partake of the ordinance and you have not entered in this relationship with God you're not having truth communion right you are observing an ordinance but this is where God want us to be amen amen praise the Lord amen we will not forsake the ordinance as long Jesus said we must do it as often as we can he will not have it with us anymore until in in in the in in the Kingdom at at the Lord's Supper that's his promise we will not do away with it but where we want to go we want to come up higher amen amen amen we want the the the the the the ordinance to prepare us to enter into a communion with God am that's what we want to talk about tonight amen that's what we want to talk about tonight and uh uh let's let's go go on yet a little bit and communion brother bam says what does the word communion means commun means to talk to have communion re really means to have Fellowship talk with each other not in church now you talking with each other in church when we come here we talk to him and he talk back to us righten I'll read it down to you right now brother say we're not even having communion if you just listening to me and you are not saying anything back he says that's not communion amen praise the Lord that's the reason why sometimes the preacher preach and and and and even his own message structs him sometime God speaks to him because it is God that is doing the speaking amen amen so he go ahead he says communion really means to have Fellowship to talk with each other if you talk on the phone with someone you carry a conversation there you are communing one with another if it is not only you doing the talking if you are allowing the the other person on the other side to talk then you are communing if you are the one that is just doing the talking then you are either instructing or teaching or directing but you're not communing praise the Lord allow them to be able to talk back to you too praise the Lord see he says here talk on the phone to someone you carry the conversation there you are communing one with another and if we should come aside and stand back and stand in the back of the building an individual with the pastor the individual and the pastor or any two people they are communing one one with the other now you do not commute By Radio because you listen and you can't talk back if you don't agree with what they say you can't share your opinion praise the Lord amen amen if you watch the news on on on television or on your phone or whatever you are not communing praise the Lord you are not communing you are not fellowshipping if you are just watching something on your phone you are not fellowshipping because you're not contributing you just receiving are we together are we stay in the thir process now it's different I mean if you are if you are listening to an AUD your Bible you are listening to the word of God then definitely uh if the word speaks to you you can say yes Lord he say Lord thank you for speaking to me through what I've just read amen praise the Lord but I mean if you are on YouTube and Facebook I don't know how you can commute oh yeah maybe you can text back and share your opinion but let me get out of there praise the Lord let me get out of there are we together amen amen but you will see what I'm going tonight and then you he say now you do not commute By Radio because you cannot talk back or television you you can by by telephone because you are communing one to the other just uh isn't one side is it should not just be one side you should be able to Fellowship I cannot commute with you now because you do not talk back so brother B behind the pullit he says I can't commun with you I I'm not communing with you but we are communing with the Lord amen amen amen amen we are communing with him because we are fellowshipping around the word amen he says I cannot commune with you now because you do not talk back so therefore it would it will not be coming to hear a minister deliver his message that's not communing that will not be coming together to to to uh to communion communion will not be there if you come just to commune with the minister you they call him to the side or an individual and you commun with him or she but to what we come into communion is for each of us as individuals to commun with Christ so while the word is being preached all the song is being sung We Are communing with him because we are relating to the word amen and we are telling him thank you praise the Lord or we are saying Lord we need your help oh God have mercy on us oh Lord thank you blessed be the name of the Lord amen hallelujah that's why when we say let's give the Lord a hand of praise it must not be a hard thing to do because he's the one you're not clapping for me we are clapping for him let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen praise the Lord amen now listen to this now as we as we want to just rub this thing down in before we get to what we want to talk about tonight he says now there is where many times that we make our greatest mistake is we we do all the talking and don't wait and give him a chance to answer back we go sometimes say Lord I who that you do so so so so so so so amen and get up and leave now that's really isn't that really is in communion there's goinging and asking for favor praise the Lord and many times and and that's that's the way our prayer life is we just get on our knees and and we just pray we cry we just speak to the Lord and we we just say Lord help me help me and we just we get you know tired and we says Lord thank you you know amen amen but we don't wait for him to speak back to us praise the Lord amen am I mean it would just be entering the room and just venting and slapping the door and getting back out I really don't think that's what we do but what are we talking about we need to come up a little higher amen amen in our relationship because the god that we have we are worshiping he's not a statue he's a living God God have feelings the Bible say he's touched by the feelings of our infs yes praise the Lord and let me tell you the truth about the M de is that you have to grow in this right it's not something that you can just you can just automatically do why because you get down on your knees before you even start praying the devil is blasting your mind with everything you have gone through something about yesterday about the thing you have to do tomorrow and your mind is just going wow wow wow wow wow wow you can't even grab your thought you just saying oh Lord Jesus I thank you Father and your mind just ging I mean sometimes if you don't know how to persist and you don't know how to stay and break through you get frustrated and you just get off your knees and you don't even know if you have prayed because your mind is just so work out praise the Lord sometimes you get a little breakthrough then you you you you feel the Lord helping you your mind is focused and you are putting things before the Lord you are speaking to God and and you are feeling good so good about it but then after you have said give him a chance also for the say so now sometimes that's where the battle is because the moment you stop you stop speaking to the Lord and you want to just keep your mind on him then pretty soon your mind start going again you know the Devil he's the he's he's the prince of the power of the air praise the Lord I tell you the the Lord really really blessed me with a wonderful thought today I was praying and uh uh uh you know I was just uh uh I was I was just committing some things in the hands of the Lord and I don't know maybe it was the the the this thought that was on my mind or whatever it is but I remember my mind went down to the place where uh uh uh uh uh uh Paul said in in in Ephesian that Satan is the is the prince of the power of the air amen then you you you will see that Paul could say that because over in Daniel the Bible says that Daniel was praying and the devil uh uh with stod his prayer or the devil was was blocking his answer and the the Prince of Persia now brother Bram said every city has a spirit right now that's that's the thought that my mind was dwelling in every Spirit has a you know has a spirit as we go about to work and we go about to shopping we move about you know what I mean the the the the the things we see the the noises we hear all of those things are spirits that are breathe in the end because just just remind yourself when you are praying the things that are coming to your mind they are not just made your mind is not making it up there was something you hear there was something you see you see so all of those Spirit come to Cloud your Heavens it comes to Cloud your mind that's right and sometimes you want to take your mind through it but you see Daniel Daniel didn't give up right praise the Lord he persisted he still there a little bit that's right and the angel said from the first day when you got down on your knees because God said before you even speak our answer your answer was on the way but the Springs of pressure the spirit of the aiel the spirit of the things you are dealing with amen amen praise the Lord amen amen what is it trying to do it is just casting doubt is casting discouragement yes and you see if we are not trained on how to wait on the Lord and how to direct our touch you will not receive an audible voice and and I don't mean that God can speak to you audibly but if you are not trained even if God speak you will not you will not identify it because God spoke to Samuel he could not identify he needed to be taught to recognize the voice of God right are we together praise the Lord now so let me let me just let me just uh uh uh uh give you some some keys here praise the Lord amen well what what I do I mean over the time uh I mean I I I read really struggle in my mind as a Young Man praise the Lord and I know that uh years back I would prayed and and I would just cry to God just just to free my mind I would just say Lord I just I just want a minute where my mind would just be stay on you praise the Lord and sometimes you you you you put your mind on the Lord and you start you start to sing a song and you you try to keep your mind on the Lord and and before you realize again your thought starts trading away from you praise the Lord sometimes it's the things that we feed our mind with and all of those things now become Spirits they become spiritual battle you realize that if you if you are if if if your if your mind is is on the word you are you are you are listening to the word or reading something to the word and your mind something catch your mind you realize that thing will be playing on your mind praise the Lord so for many times I I was struggled and I just I just couldn't get my mind still so the Lord help me and every time when I get through praying I'll take the Bible I'll start to read praise the Lord amen I'll start to read now we have audio Bible sometimes I would just play an audio Bible or I just play the message you know and and as as I'm trying to to to to meditate or listening to what I'm hearing sometime God speaks to me through those things praise the Lord amen sometime I pick up something and I say I know this is the Lord praise the Lord so you see just like how Samuel was trained to identify the voice of God we have we have to be trained praise the Lord amen you have to train your mind if you can't get your mind still I mean if you if you can if if you are not uh can't train your mind to memorize Bible verses you you know if you can train your mind to memorize Bible verses think about the Bible verse you want to to to memorize and let it come back to you I try to think what did I read or what was my memory verse today and the moment your attention is there that's that's what God wants the moment your attention is there he knows that my child is trying to take a little step then he comes around praise the Lord then he brings the thing that you were thinking about he just flooded to your mind then you get so excited oh my I never thought about this it it is now you creating the thought praise the Lord amen because what we want to do we want to commune with him we don't just want to bust God around Lord I want this Lord help me this Lord I want this Lord help me this then you just SL no we want to commune with him we want to be able to have a time and just appreciate him and just thank him and just think about his goodness think about the ways he being merciful to you praise the Lord amen and then when you come out of prayer and you see the enemy flooding your thoughts with thing take the word take the Bible I mean take your Bible take your Bible not the phone Bible you know what I means because as soon as you take the phone Bible WhatsApp coming Facebook you know the finger go so quick you slip it down you you like this you like this before you realize you you you fin gone you are reading who have post what that's right you are not meditating that's right you are not communing you don't need a whole day sometime just just just five minutes 10 minutes and say Lord thank you thank you for this little moment praise the Lord are we together but when you say long prayers until until he answer back that's when you are getting communion you know BR Braham say this way is is it sound it sound OD but let's let me read that again he says Lord I I I you know I will that you would do so and so and so he says and you get up and leave he says now that's really that that that really is in communion that's going and asking for favor but when you when you stay long enough praise the Lord which mean you are persistent you know the devil trying to distract you but you are persisting Lord I just want to say thank you I just want to say thank you thank you praise the Lord and you just keep pressing through when you stay long enough with the Lord now and a great way to commun is to be agreed you must agreed upon certain things and that's why we say Amen to the word praise the lord we are agreeing that's communion when the person is talking you are shaking your head yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah I know I know praise the Lord so when we say Amen to the word we we are agree Lord that's truth are we together amen you see that's that's the reason why uh uh uh in most time you will see that I like to bring uh the prayer meeting before the preaching of the word because what I want to do is that uh we have spoken to the Lord I want to give him time to speak back to us am amen amen are we together amen and that's why we say Amen to the word we are agreeing with him okay let's go back now to Genesis let's go back with just from Revelation chapter 3 let's go back to Genesis chapter 40 praise the Lord I'm left with uh few minutes here to to let you go home amen Genesis chapter 14 and it came to pass after this things after W thing we going back to 39 there the buler now so what I want what I want us to see now the same thing that happened to Abraham is happening to his seed because Joseph is a Seed of Abraham so God is going to commune with Joseph God is going to give him a communion praise the Lord amen God is going to give him a communion now let me let me let me say this because when you look back in Genesis 15 or or 14 that that that we that we read from amen are we together yeah Genesis 15 and 14 we were studying from you will realize that uh uh uh uh that communion is a sense of a spiritual communion amen amen because in in in in all of Abraham's Journey the only time that God was made flesh to Abraham was Genesis 18 God de with Abraham in in dreams and vision and different Supernatural experience that's the reason why Luke 17:30 is a type of re I mean uh Genesis 18 so this experience here in Genesis 14 is a supernatural experience it's pretty much the very same thing that that that Joseph is experiencing Year God giving his son a communion after the battle was over praise the Lord amen amen amen after the battle was over God giving his son a communion let's go back to chapter 39 and let's see the battle that Joseph had to face amen you love the Lord tonight amen Genesis 39 and uh let's read from verse one and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and ptif fire the the officer of pharaoh captain of the guy this guy was a ranking officer amen he was a ranking officer an Egyptian H bought him of the hands of the the the ishmaelites this this guy is supposed to be his brother from from ishma but anyway let's not let us not go into that which have brought him down H him and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and the master saw that the Lord was with him praise the Lord now this Egyptian never knew the Lord so the the the the the the phrase there and the master saw that the LA was with him he don't know the law he know the gods of Egypt it is it is a statement that means that there is something about this boy the Lord the his master saw there was something about this boy amen amen the master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did prosper in his hands and Joseph found Grace in his sight and uh he and he s him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put in his hands praise the Lord now so here here is the this uh H uh Egyptian uh H uh Captain you know taking this young boy Joseph was about 17 years old when he was when he was sold away from his brother taking this young young young uh uh uh boy and and uh and and uh uh and and pretty soon he realized in that since this guy being in my house things are different yes amen praise the Lord amen I don't I don't understand it I don't I really don't understand it I believe that he might have had qu he might have asked Jacob question who who is your father was was your tribe where you came from praise the Lord to to to to have such a confidence to set him over his house praise the Lord are we together glory be to God and it came to pass verse five from the time that he made him Overseer in his house and over all that he had the Lord blessed the Egyptian house for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in his house and in his field the Lord was even blessing his work there was something that I was going to drop in my notes like I said on Sunday I I was I was trying to bring this this principle about communion and Tiding because right there in in Genesis chapter 14 there are two principle thing of the Christian faith amen there are two principle thing now what see what is happening here Joseph presence in portify house ptif is getting promotion in his job the Bible say even in his field Joseph is not working in his field but because of his presence so you see it's the same thing that applied to the believer when the believer grab the concept amen when they grab the spiritual concept of putting God first hallelujah praise the Lord it can even bless the economy of your company it can bless the economy of the city just because of this believer that's the principle amen that is the principle because you see God never plan to take care of us based on a nation economy no God plan to take care of us is based on his word it's based on his economy brother Bram say he will bankrupt heaven for one of his promise to f but if the people can just grab it amen if the people can just grab it and start learning to put God first not it being a struggle God want to break us from that struggle when it's a struggle then you we have not entered in it am it's something that we must love to do amen communion should be something that we must love to do Tiding should be something that we must love to do are we together now so the Lord blessed him in his field and he left all that he had in Joseph hand and he knew not he never even knew what was coming in what was going out he never knew nothing praise the Lord amen amen he was just spending I mean I mean everybody was looking at this guy I mean he was getting favor with Pharaoh he was getting he was getting promotion everybody was just looking what what what is pipy doing the Bible says everything in Joseph hand except the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored that word goodly there it means that he was a handsome boy that's where his trouble came to St he was a goodly person means that he was a hamson young man glory be to God Amen see how the devil love hamson young man and beautiful young women and it came to pass after these things there his master Wife cast her ey upon Joseph and said lied with me that's what the Bible wanted for us to watch before God will bring Joseph in a communion just like Abraham fought a battle Joseph had to fight a battle Jacob rise up with the angel all night and God brought him into communion change his name amen amen amen amen praise the Lord like we read on Sunday brother B said there is strength in the communion it changes us it bring us much closer to God it's not a ritual that's the kind of a communion I'm talking about the communion that MDES gave to Abraham was not this bread and wine that we ate on Sunday brother say it was a part of himself amen now here is this young boy not even knowing what is future in his mind he's thinking what have I done to my brothers I wish I could just keep my mouth shut is it because of my dream is it because of the CT that Daddy sold for me he just he trying to figure everything in his mind just at a time where God is giving him a a a favor and he he he's beginning to relax he's beginning to re relax his mind and now he's thinking about his brother because here say he's in plenty here say he's he's I mean he's he's over this house he's an overseer he has everything that he's need and he's thinking about his brothers and thinking about his daddy at just at a time where he think he must rest we are pag and stranger there's no resting place here for you praise the Lord try to make yourself comfortable God will tear the net on [Music] you amen amen praise the Lord as soon now we get little Comfort praise the lord we start changing our diet no time to pray no time for this and that yeah yeah you know because we're not we're not legal the Mage praise the Lord amen that's my my ego he will tear the net from under you just at the time where everything was going well for him it's not it's not even his neighbor's wife it's not even a girl from the next house the very house he was living in Praise the Lord not his master's daughter because it were being e Jacob I Joseph just marry her just marry her but his master's wife that's treason that's treason this is a high ranking officer this boy he's not an Egyptian he's a foreigner it's treason is something that must cause Joseph life M if he's found guilty he must be haned and killed if the Lord is Justice if the Lord is just this was treason it's a it's it's it's a break of trust because it's a high ranking officer pretty soon is going to enter into into the Egyptian Army pipy has brought a man into the he he's a spy because all he wanted to do is just is just uh h h h sleep with a generous wife and then be getting all the information and be sending it to his people this was treason it's not a a common Bible story this is a very serious thing praise the Lord and that's what the devil want to do amen he's not going to you into something he want to tie you to a place where your reputation will be scander yeah bring you to the place where you can't even have trust in yourself yeah that's right glory be to God that they got got the word woman and then she came to Adam the devil got this woman and now she's coming to Joseph praise the lord it's a battle but I'm coming I just get a few minutes here I'll let you go tonight but he refused Joseph refused and said unto his master why behold my master would not that now what is with me in his house uh and he have committed all that he have to my hands there is none greater in this house than I which mean there were other servants he was not the only seven but he was the chief seven glory be to God he was the chief seven that's the kind of age we are living in let me tell you people that God has found favor with God has found favor with us praise the Lord with truth that have been given to us the devil knows that he can he can he I mean uh it it would take him a whole lot for him to want to expose you to maybe another man's wife or your boss wife I mean you a man must be falling so L has God far away from God that he will get into death but no you know what he's doing he's using that little gadget called the cell phone right and he's defying our minds that's right he's defying our minds yes before Eve body was defied her mind was defied and that's the Same Old Devil yes praise the Lord that's where our greater battle is it's in this information age it's in this technology age the things we are feeding our minds with all the fil all the the nasty things the devil put there you know nobody there with you and when he when he defile your mind you don't even have the strength to get on your knees right that's right that's where our prayer life is destroyed that's right we can't have communion with God because we are communing with something else praise the Lord amen if first begin just a little talk you are a pretty young man Joseph that's just how it begins she just posted something innocent praise the Lord are we together am there is no greater in this house than I neither have he kept back anything from me but thee you are the only thing I don't touch in this house praise the lord and there should be things that it should be the only things that we should not touch that we should not expose our mind toone this is the greatest battle ever fought people this is the greater battle that's why brother bandam told us the greater battle ever fought is the battle in the mind if the devil can get our mind messed up our life will be messed up I don't care how how much we try to dress right and try to talk right try to behave right when your mind is messed up your life will be messed up you can never concentrate you can never Focus that's right you all over the place no no sense of direction because your mind is messed up glory be to God amen hallelujah amen this is the Seed of Abraham that was his battle praise the Lord that was his battle now he's exposed now he's being the Chief Joseph don't go on the field he only gave command he was a manager so she begin to dress all sorts of enticing weight and in uh incent way this young man was trying to guide his heart yes knowing that he he should not feel the god of his father praise the Lord are we together amen and I believe that Joseph all the sorrow of the path started to creep back on him what have I done how did I misstep what what didn't I do right but it's not all about what you have done or what you have not done it's about a God that one to brings you into communion praise the Lord he wants to bring you into communion and now he's watching what are you going to do are we going to spend endless time on our phone look you can spend uh uh constructive time on your phone yes that's right praise the Lord I'm not blasting cell phone I'm blasting what is done on cell phones children learn how to play music on the phone they learn how to do their homework on the phone learn how to do what but when you are spending endless time yeah endless time in something that is not benefiting you right right just looking at other people Garbage When God want to bring you you into communion when he want to bring us into communion praise the Lord and what he's looking for is a son or the daughter that can say in office enough let me go and pray oh enough is enough let me go and run go do exercise you get nothing to do run run around the compound right do something that will benefit your physical health something that will benefit your mind all his sorrow starts to come back to his mind sometimes the Lord will Deliver Us from things and then we get ourself trapped back into those things then we start to remember all our sorrow and all all you know we just stop you just startop feeling frustrated you never did anything but you just tired right no sense of focus praise the Lord God's people are children of discipline we must discipline ourself because his bride will give him the preeminence this bride will give him the preeminence this bride will get into his chamber even if he don't want us there amen that was why yesterday she never wait for the king to call her she stepped forth she stepped she broke the persan Lord right this Jewish girl broke the persans Lord if I'm a queen of this land don't put me on the land time praise the Lord has sarus was not even expecting her to come forth when she came forth man the guy almost got blind whatever he was doing he says that just let's have the meeting later y go home praise the Lord and all of those guys were sitting there in in the compound and they were thinking now what what is she doing did the king send for her he shut every one of them up he dismissed everybody he said whatever you want I give you to the half of my kingdom that's a bride that's a woman that knows her position amen there's a woman that knows her marital right right are we together see what says here I need to let you go home tonight me the prince listen today he says who was this Prince none other than the incarnated Lord Jesus Christ in his magnificent power he was the same one a little later after he met Abraham and gave him as being a covenant people communion amen then now through that same Covenant and he and he was listen now he was in a shadow in a shadow in a type yes not the reality in a shadow amen he was in the shadow that that mesc when he became a man in flesh will be cut into parts and the communion will be given the furtherance of his broken body as we as we take to die there that Maes the make Abraham and Abraham PID tie to him amen Abraham the greatest man on the face of the Earth paid tie to ma the the king of Peace the king of solom the king of righteousness how can you how how how will he do it how did he do it this man without beginning of days without end of time he was not visible it was something that was happening God saw the the the the the the the earnest of his son heart God saw that uh H H Abraham held nothing against Lot in so much that he was able to raise his life in his household God saw it so much that he stepped down in the Supernatural form gave Abraham and his men energy amen that man of a household will go against an entire Army that's what brother bam says if the if the if the if the if the church the bride knows her position she will be an invisible Army praise the Lord then God comes down in a supernatural way and Minister something to Abraham that's the reason why when he came out of the battle God expressed it in the vision what he experienced supernaturally God express it to him in the vision I will be your shell and your exceeding and great reward coming back to confirm that it was God that met him in the battle praise the Lord how do you expect you you you expect Joshua a man that are just been traveling h h h h in the way nness they never went jogging and training and taking pushup to build an army and they are coming here to to take over the land how how do you expect these people almighty God will come down in the same Supernatural form and to to to to to Joshua he's seen he's seen a man that looks like a military man but it was God in a supernal form if there was anybody around they were not seeing what Joshua was saying praise the Lord when he took a sword then God declar himself I'm the Lord I'm the captain of the Lord hor I have come to join with you in this battle I've have come to give you your inheritance that's what God does for his children he's the one that fight our battles Hallelujah are we together amen glory be to God amen amen so what happened to Joseph she would try everything even try to lock the door on on on him praise the Lord amen I'm coming to be foolish now she put a very strong password on her phone so nobody can open her phone do face it will not open do finger it will not open okay let me leave there let me preach glory be to God let me preach tonight amen you love the Lord tonight amen amen amen when I saw every one of you dressing back sitting in the back I was saying oh God have mercy what did I preach on Sunday these people are they keep going back pretty soon they will soon start sitting outside amen praise the Lord amen now but what what is going to happen here amen just like I said they're supposed to be treason it's supposed to be treason Joseph was supposed to be Han and killed but I will tell you that the life of Joseph his character pipy could not bring it to terms he Lov his wife but it was hard for him he couldn't bring it to terms because let me tell you before Joseph I'll give you a little Story by myself uh uh that's that's back in in Liberia you know during the war and uh I had some friends uh that were working with the peacekeeping Force and and then uh you know I gravitated to them there was there was a guy from Ghana that that we became very friendly that was just before I got saved we were very very friendly and this guy he wanted to take me to Gham with him you know I mean it was I just I just believe it was the law of favor and what happened was that he was the the chef in the house of three of the ghanians general that was a sign to the the peacekeeping force and they were the next in command to so the compound that we were in it was just was the compound of officers one of the corner would tell me when I choose to leave after I got saved I told him I I didn't want to work there anymore you would tell me he says you are a different boy he would tell me how he he placed because I was facing their rooms I go in their rooms I face their bedrooms I mean these were military men these people they were not they were not uh I mean they were not I I mean they were strangers and one of them was the uh the military police of Ghana very very very tall guy you know man the guy I mean he can smoke like oh my God this why just smoking praise the Lord but very very very very scary man I mean he was so huge very big when he when he talks he command he he don't talk he come in and I mean at the end it just I mean they would just put things down money different things in all de my M was not I didn't know that it was you know they were trying to find what kind of this this they had you know this a guy that that came to help us there and I mean after the week they jail him straight because he put something down and he stole it I mean these These are these are military guys generous they are in war zone so they are not playing they are looking for criminals they are looking for uh uh people that are on recur they I mean all of that so I'm I'm trying to say that uh pfy being a military General might have tried Joseph in every way yes to make him the head of his house they might have tried him in every way yes so there is no way he could come to turn so instead of the death penalty he sent him to the dungeon life in praison that's the least he could do are we together now so uh uh uh but here's Joseph there in praison he's in praising he's in praising and God will come in a supernatural way to comfort him that's what communion is amen you know you you talk to somebody and you just feel so good you just feel so good you feet oh man that was a good talk I really enjoyed that was that was a good conversation we had just now God will come in a supernatural way to comfort him yes amen God will give him a dream amen yes he will give him a dream that will serve as an interpretation to these two men the bread and the wine communion Joseph in despair he's he's asking himself what have I done oh God all God of my fathers he's there crying he he's uh he's uh he's he's uh regretting should I maybe if I would have done it I was not going to be here maybe my life and he just he just all his mind is just messed up but God will come in a supernatural way the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob praise the Lord L we come in a supernatural way and give him a dream exact dream these guys are talking their dream says oh my God it look in your hair when you dreaming exact and and the thing that will comfort him more after he gave the interpretation it happened exact that's the thing that come for when you see God's word in action when you see God's word coming to pass now you making it coming to pass but the word coming to pass you just stay back you oh wow amen that's communion that's spiritual communion when you go through the struggle you go through you said Lord I Trust You Lord I I hold to your word you never failed I believe you are the same yes I believe you will come true for me I'm not going to defy myself not going to mess up my mind amen because I I may hide from everybody I can't hide from you amen praise the Lord and why are you there God coming in a supernatural way and say something or you hear something on the T or you read something and it just bring you to tears you just know that this have to be God that's communion that's communion that's what communion must do to us it must bring us to tears it must bring us to worship it must bring us to appreciation amen praise the Lord if I continue
