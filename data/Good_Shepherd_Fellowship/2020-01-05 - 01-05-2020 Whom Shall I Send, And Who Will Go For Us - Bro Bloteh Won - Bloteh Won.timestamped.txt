[42:06] Lord he's the most important guest in
[42:09] this in the service is the Lord Jesus
[42:12] Christ amen
[42:13] praise the Lord amen and we will bring
[42:18] few reports to you sister cousine is
[42:22] doing well her surgery went well and
[42:28] spoke spoke with the husband this
[42:30] morning and and she's recovering praise
[42:34] the Lord
[42:35] and we were down to see brother brother
[42:39] zekiel but Ben is not with us he's on an
[42:42] official duty so he hope to be in this
[42:45] evening and but Ezekiel he really taught
[42:50] you who have been here this morning to
[42:53] be able to say some few things from his
[42:55] heart to you people thanking you for
[42:58] your prayers but he will eat any more of
[43:01] your prayers and I thought he was going
[43:07] to be here so I really had a time to
[43:09] talk to him and actually if I could say
[43:12] some things on his behalf
[43:14] most especially around his health
[43:16] situation but he's doing okay we know
[43:19] our brother he's uh he's he's a fighter
[43:22] and we believe that the Lord is going to
[43:26] bring him true and everything that he's
[43:29] going through praise the Lord Amen so I
[43:33] believe that he and the family they are
[43:36] thinking to to travel to Texas just to
[43:42] be be around the parents did a little
[43:44] bit wider deal with the health situation
[43:48] that he's having so he asks that we pray
[43:51] for him for Scott in sister now me I
[43:55] stay away and supporting sister Esther
[44:00] in the passing of a father-in-law spoke
[44:04] with brother Lloyd yesterday he wanted
[44:05] me to bring his greetings to you praise
[44:08] the Lord
[44:08] Amy and so we just want to thank the
[44:14] Lord for all of the express the Lord and
[44:16] I know just coming to the end of the
[44:20] year has been a little bit of a struggle
[44:27] with few of the Saints being down in
[44:31] their health even myself I started
[44:34] feeling a little bit sick as well close
[44:36] in the year but I think it's a good sign
[44:39] amen praise the Lord I believe that you
[44:43] know the enemy is trying to
[44:48] discourage fight against us but we know
[44:50] that a lot is on our side amen
[44:52] if the Lord be with us who can be
[44:54] against us praise the Lord Amen this
[44:59] evening as we announce we will be having
[45:02] our communion service and the Lord's
[45:07] Supper as as a church and we normally
[45:13] approach that in the evening time
[45:15] because of scriptural partying that is
[45:20] laid in the in the Bible and Paul says
[45:24] that evening the Lord broke bread with
[45:26] his disciples so we will be having
[45:29] communion the first Sunday of the year
[45:31] we should have done that on the third
[45:33] first but we just you know wanted to
[45:37] approach it on this first Sunday and I
[45:40] will say this in light to death is that
[45:46] there are three ordinance that the Lord
[45:50] Jesus Christ left with his church
[45:52] we know that salvation is a free gift
[45:56] that is given and Jesus paid the price
[46:00] of our Redemption there is no work that
[46:04] you can really do for the Lord
[46:06] everything that we do for God is a life
[46:09] of appreciation
[46:10] we are just appreciating what he has
[46:13] already done because I call into his
[46:16] word he has done everything amen and the
[46:20] scripture says all his works was
[46:22] finished even from the foundation of the
[46:23] world so but yet he left his church
[46:29] three literal elements you know three
[46:34] literal elements and and it's not that
[46:37] he left it with us to be a work for us
[46:40] to do but he invited us to be part of it
[46:45] amen and he said to the disciples happy
[46:49] ie if you know these things and do them
[46:52] you know for watching he was watching
[46:55] Peter feed Peter say no you will now
[46:57] wash my feet he said well if I don't do
[47:00] it then you and I
[47:00] clean and and Peter said okay you can
[47:04] wash my feet wash my whole body he said
[47:06] no the fetus enough and then after he
[47:10] did it he washed all the disciples feet
[47:12] he says I'm your Lord and your master I
[47:14] washed your feet so I would want I'm
[47:19] doing this as an example for you to do
[47:22] it one on to another so we realize even
[47:27] from the Old Testament
[47:29] there were do or I to me in even in the
[47:35] Old Testament in the old Tabernacle
[47:37] whenever they were doing sacrifices they
[47:41] never God will require them to bring
[47:45] those total doors the total dogs were
[47:48] never cut in in in half the other
[47:53] animals the ships and God would divide
[47:56] them in half
[47:57] they always represent do what to me and
[48:01] what is this do or die to me the
[48:04] daughter to men is salvation and healing
[48:09] praise the Lord
[48:11] the two goes together he's the Lord they
[48:15] saved our soul and the God that hew our
[48:20] body praise the Lord this body does not
[48:24] need need to be safe because we are born
[48:28] we grow we get old and if Jesus Tyree we
[48:32] go to the grave praise the Lord
[48:34] but the body needs to be healed the body
[48:37] needs to be strong so healing is the
[48:41] children's bread healing is for the body
[48:44] the saving of the soul is the work that
[48:51] God does within the believer so you see
[48:55] in this in these three elements that he
[48:58] gives to the church they also speak of
[49:02] the door I to me it was beautiful when I
[49:07] when I came across there steadying this
[49:10] weekend you you remember in the Bible
[49:13] the scripture say
[49:14] there he died believe and is baptized
[49:17] shall be safe
[49:21] praise the Lord so we believe the Lord
[49:24] Jesus Christ by faith amen
[49:27] but our baptism identified us with his
[49:33] death burial and resurrection because
[49:36] that was what he did for our salvation
[49:39] praise the Lord
[49:41] so when we believe him and accept him by
[49:44] faith by his word he expect us to be
[49:48] identified with with his death burial
[49:52] and resurrection baptism in the name of
[49:55] the Lord Jesus Christ then the
[50:00] convenient also much as in John chapter
[50:04] 13 he says take this bread it is my body
[50:08] drink this wine is my blood and it is
[50:13] also a type of healing praise the Lord I
[50:18] was going to react or to you this
[50:20] morning from desperation but Benham says
[50:23] that he says the communion also
[50:28] represents healing praise the Lord
[50:33] amen he says it also represents healing
[50:37] now now he says this he says and now me
[50:41] you meditate remember Israel ate it in
[50:45] desperation and true the journey there
[50:49] wasn't a feeble one a morning in the end
[50:54] of 40 years this is divine healing also
[51:00] praise the Lord
[51:01] so the communion is divine healing in
[51:05] u.s. kept communion it's almost like you
[51:08] running away from your own healing now
[51:11] the church through the years taught it
[51:14] in a way that you have to be heal you
[51:18] have to be I mean you have to be you I
[51:21] mean you have to be identified with the
[51:23] body to partake of the body amen and the
[51:26] way we identify by
[51:28] is by water baptism in the name of the
[51:31] Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord the
[51:38] Bible says we are watched by the water
[51:40] of the word that's what for watching
[51:42] represent it represent our outward
[51:47] sentence at the grace of God does in our
[51:50] life as we trust God and as we move
[51:53] daily
[51:55] praise the Lord now this is the first
[51:58] Sunday so I have to to go over these
[52:01] things a little bit with the church just
[52:03] to be able to encourage us I will tell
[52:06] you as the church trust the Lord and
[52:10] partake of these things
[52:11] this is the mystical body partaking of
[52:14] it we are identifying with God's Word
[52:17] and God come behind it in package world
[52:19] God come behind it and perform the
[52:23] things that he have promised to do
[52:26] praise the Lord
[52:28] amen that is the reason why we encourage
[52:32] ourself in these things and we also
[52:35] encourage you to be part of it
[52:38] praise the Lord you see it could be very
[52:41] strange if I choose to have a prayer
[52:44] line this morning and say I'm going to
[52:46] pray for your sickness most everybody
[52:49] would come in the line they will either
[52:51] come for a sec need or they would come
[52:53] for a need of someone but if we should
[52:57] set up the communion table in the
[52:59] evening everybody will stay home praise
[53:04] the Lord
[53:05] that's divine healing
[53:12] so we want to encourage you while we'll
[53:14] be back at 5:00 p.m. this evening and
[53:17] you welcome to to come in and be part of
[53:22] the services evening let's just stand on

[53:35] you have your seat maybe we do the end
[53:38] of the singing I mean the end of the
[53:40] Hoodoo singing at the end of the service
[53:43] praise the Lord Amen
[53:53] as I have chapter 6 as I chapter 6
[54:18] as I chapter 6 let's just read from
[54:23] verse 1 in a year that can use your die
[54:29] I saw also the Lord sitting upon the
[54:33] throne high and lifted up and his train
[54:37] filled the temple above is stood the
[54:42] surfing each each heart each one had six
[54:47] wings with twin they covered their face
[54:51] and between the cover their feet and
[54:55] between the dead fly and one cry unto
[55:02] another and said holy holy holy is the
[55:06] Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of
[55:10] his glory and the posts of the door move
[55:15] are the voice of him that cried and the
[55:20] house was filled with smoke then said I
[55:24] whoa is me for I am undone because I am
[55:29] a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the
[55:34] midst of people of unclean lips for my
[55:38] eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[55:42] hosts then flew one of the surfing on to
[55:46] me having a life cold in his hands which
[55:51] he have taken with the tongue from of
[55:55] the altar and he lay it upon my mouth
[56:00] and said lo this have touched thy lips
[56:05] and thine iniquity is taking the way and
[56:09] I seen his porch
[56:12] Amen all my desire that one of those
[56:17] angels would fly from from the presence
[56:19] of the Lord and touch me this morning I

[56:58] first Sunday of the year and as
[57:02] Christians we have come to identify
[57:05] ourselves with your resurrection that is
[57:09] the reason why the Sunday morning

[58:15] is taking care of this word and we thank

[58:42] father God as we approach this year

[58:48] know you the whole time and eternity in
[58:51] your hands you promise in your word that

[59:01] father your grace we just bless us
[59:04] together in the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:06] Christ we pray amen the Lord bless you
[59:11] you may have a seat I want to use a liar
[59:16] question this morning as of as as mine
[59:20] as my message whom shall I send
[59:23] asking on God's behalf and who will go
[59:28] for us in a generation that we are
[59:32] living in an age that is being filled
[59:35] every day with atheism and Joshua
[59:45] believes and every day science is
[59:50] bringing out more evidence to be able to
[59:54] prove that there is no god but it was
[59:56] beautiful yesterday I was driving and I
[59:59] was listening to a science program on
[1:00:02] the testing of DNA and and and as they
[1:00:07] were testing the DNA's they test the DNA
[1:00:09] is from the proteins in the body so they
[1:00:14] were I mean it was it was a kind of a
[1:00:16] lab program but you know they were
[1:00:20] making it coming it was a radio program
[1:00:22] making coming on the different things
[1:00:23] that they were doing but there was
[1:00:26] something that kind of first struck me
[1:00:28] in the conversation as as their as as
[1:00:32] the tested DNA and the guy was saying
[1:00:39] how how fascinating it was to be able to
[1:00:42] see you know trace your identification
[1:00:45] back I meant to your father to your
[1:00:48] mother you know just from the proteins
[1:00:50] in your body in a different way they
[1:00:52] were bringing it out and the commutator
[1:00:54] says something that was very very
[1:00:56] profound when it came to the
[1:00:59] and and and the proven he said that he
[1:01:05] said in the Bible is said in the
[1:01:08] beginning was the word you know he made
[1:01:12] that comment in the beginning was the
[1:01:13] word he says actually that you have said
[1:01:16] in the beginning was the person and the
[1:01:19] person spoke the word Amen because when
[1:01:28] you trace a DNA you end up to a person
[1:01:32] you know so it was when he was taking
[1:01:36] the concept from if you trace a DNA you
[1:01:40] will end up to a person so he says I
[1:01:43] think is supposed to be in the beginning
[1:01:46] was a person and the person spoke the
[1:01:50] word I almost had a hallelujah faith in
[1:01:56] the car I said science is proving the
[1:02:00] Word of God because a word is a taught
[1:02:03] Express so if in the beginning was the
[1:02:09] word there was a thought behind our word
[1:02:12] and the top that was behind our word was
[1:02:15] the person that was behind the word
[1:02:22] praise the Lord Amen if you trace it you
[1:02:28] come up to a person praise the Lord Amen
[1:02:33] well as we are living in social society
[1:02:36] dinner as I said on the Terry first
[1:02:38] night I mean every other day you listen
[1:02:42] to baby C's and now you you even you all
[1:02:45] know from the news what is cooking in in
[1:02:48] the Middle East and I mean in Iraq and
[1:02:52] Iran and everything that is happening
[1:02:53] you know you know we are living in in
[1:02:59] trouble sometimes praise the Lord Amen
[1:03:03] just a couple of weeks ago there was
[1:03:09] another shooting in the church over in
[1:03:12] Texas
[1:03:14] because of a man that comes asking for
[1:03:16] help in UCC the acts were helping and
[1:03:20] got angry you know that the church did
[1:03:23] not help him enough and I mean there
[1:03:27] were just angry people all over the
[1:03:29] place that's the word that we are living
[1:03:34] in whoosh I'd go for us it's strange
[1:03:43] that God is asking this question the
[1:03:45] person that is asking this question is
[1:03:47] the Lord verse it says also i heard the
[1:03:52] voice of the law seen moon shall ascend
[1:03:57] and we shall go for us there is to
[1:04:04] pronounce day one girl speaking but to
[1:04:09] pronounce Almighty God speaking who
[1:04:17] shall ascend and we shall go for us the
[1:04:23] same God I said let us make man one girl
[1:04:27] speaking but he said let us make me he's
[1:04:32] the same one saying we shall go for us
[1:04:36] he never said when shall we sing he said
[1:04:41] Lucia asking are the Lord and we shall
[1:04:48] go for us praise the Lord Amen now we
[1:04:56] were we did we went through this just
[1:04:59] couple of months ago talking on the
[1:05:03] priority of God you see the the scallops
[1:05:06] they they read the Bible especially the
[1:05:10] in Genesis chapter 1 when the Bible says
[1:05:13] and then when God used that word in
[1:05:15] season and God said let us make man in
[1:05:18] our image there when when they study
[1:05:21] that from from from the original Hebrew
[1:05:25] God
[1:05:25] gromek and there there is a name of god
[1:05:29] that wishes elohim praise the lord amen
[1:05:34] and the expression that is me in that
[1:05:38] structure as shows a God there has many
[1:05:44] abilities that has many characteristics
[1:05:49] amen a God there has many attributes so
[1:05:55] the great colors being trouble to be
[1:05:59] able to be able to express or give the
[1:06:04] identification of the God now you have
[1:06:07] to know that this God that we serve
[1:06:09] he's not a man amen
[1:06:13] he's not a man he's the Creator of
[1:06:17] heaven and earth
[1:06:18] one time he fill our space and all time
[1:06:25] he fill everywhere he was the great
[1:06:28] internal spirit
[1:06:29] he'd word alone praise Lord God as a
[1:06:40] great intent of spirit to give him a son
[1:06:44] at that time is to give him a beginning
[1:06:49] because a son is the beginning praise
[1:06:55] the Lord
[1:06:57] so the scallops try to funnel wood to be
[1:07:05] able to express this girl to hold these
[1:07:09] great characteristics they say and God
[1:07:13] said let us make man in Genesis chapter
[1:07:18] 3 when man fell the Bible's use the same
[1:07:23] word again the Bible say and God said
[1:07:25] man has become one of us Genesis chapter
[1:07:34] 11 had a Tower of Babel
[1:07:39] when man was building a tower to reach
[1:07:42] the heaven God came down again and he
[1:07:46] expressed his great and great one
[1:07:55] dwelling with all his attributes
[1:07:57] characteristics in him and he says let
[1:08:04] us he's the same one speaking here
[1:08:08] well sure are sent in whoosh a goal for
[1:08:13] us oh I can spend the entire morning and
[1:08:17] the rest of this year's just speaking on
[1:08:19] there but I'll not want to take all of
[1:08:22] the time this morning I would just want
[1:08:26] to call our attention to say God is
[1:08:31] looking for a man God is looking for a
[1:08:35] woman in this dying generation that will
[1:08:39] be able to stand up for his name praise
[1:08:45] the Lord
[1:08:46] amen no matter what your denomination or
[1:08:51] belief what your to logic or belief all
[1:08:55] of those things can be conversation we
[1:08:57] can sit down we can talk about it but a
[1:08:59] subject before us this morning that God
[1:09:02] is looking for a person that will be
[1:09:07] able to stand in this godless society a
[1:09:10] man or a woman that will be able to
[1:09:13] stand for righteousness now will be able
[1:09:16] to stand for truth and a man or a woman
[1:09:21] that will be able to stay and say I know
[1:09:24] that there is a God in heaven where
[1:09:27] there were such a drug was I better go
[1:09:30] that would say even if you don't deliver
[1:09:31] us we will not bow down that's what we
[1:09:39] want to talk about this morning
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:47] Oh sometimes it looks easy you know ever
[1:09:52] we come all together like this and we
[1:09:54] identified our set as Christians in a
[1:09:58] church and and we can sing it and that
[1:10:00] to the music you know anything and we
[1:10:03] listen to the word and and and and and
[1:10:05] and you know and somebody say Amen it
[1:10:08] sounds reasonable and another person say
[1:10:09] Amen and we can just float into death
[1:10:13] our scripture here is setting out a
[1:10:16] scene of a young prophet outlier they
[1:10:20] had a good friend you see of the king
[1:10:22] they grew up together one became a king
[1:10:25] one was a prophet praise the Lord and
[1:10:29] being the King you know they move
[1:10:31] together I mean the King come and see
[1:10:34] the Prophet for advice you know in all
[1:10:37] of the Haran and and he's the man of the
[1:10:39] land and I mean he's he's the fan of
[1:10:44] silver of voice to the people the final
[1:10:47] savor
[1:10:48] I tore it it to the people that was the
[1:10:50] king amen
[1:10:52] the Prophet is the final spiritual voice
[1:10:55] to the people are we together
[1:10:59] praise the Lord when it came to the
[1:11:03] place work as higher influence was
[1:11:08] taking away the one that was making him
[1:11:11] to 200 words that I don't know his
[1:11:15] nature whether he was never so what when
[1:11:17] he was but for some reason he was
[1:11:19] leaning to use ear the King because that
[1:11:22] was his friend they were working
[1:11:25] together and and and and I mean they had
[1:11:28] good friendship good relationship but
[1:11:31] when you see a left the scene as I
[1:11:36] needed another influence if we will be
[1:11:40] able to stand for God in his generation
[1:11:44] if you just go back to Isaiah chapter 5
[1:11:48] and we a little baby will you will learn
[1:11:50] that's where the Bible says woe unto
[1:11:52] them that call good evil and call evil
[1:11:57] good
[1:11:58] you go back there you will read the
[1:12:01] Bible says right there in Isaiah chapter
[1:12:03] 5 woe unto them that bill house upon
[1:12:07] house which of course is what we do in
[1:12:12] our society or the sky strip or one
[1:12:14] apartment over another department so you
[1:12:18] can see that it was in such such a time
[1:12:22] with such a society and such a
[1:12:26] civilization but here God was looking
[1:12:30] for a man that would be able to stand
[1:12:33] for him no matter how the society
[1:12:36] advanced no matter how science were
[1:12:39] advanced in cell phones and cars and and
[1:12:41] different thing in knowledge will
[1:12:43] increase God is looking for the man that
[1:12:46] will be able to stand by biblical
[1:12:48] principle praise the Lord
[1:12:53] o men and women that will respect the
[1:12:56] marriage vows they know what it is that
[1:12:58] it's a secret Institute that God himself
[1:13:02] has established our society is missing
[1:13:11] the value of family prays alone many
[1:13:16] young women just want to have children
[1:13:18] and look for somebody to poor child
[1:13:20] support on it becomes a way of income
[1:13:25] praise the Lord
[1:13:26] what many men want to go judge they just
[1:13:29] want to go down through the neighbor who
[1:13:31] every apartment is sleep with anything
[1:13:32] to have skirt or dress on
[1:13:41] we are those morals value young children
[1:13:49] are growing with no courtesy no respect
[1:13:55] preparing for another ones God is
[1:14:00] looking for the man who shot our same
[1:14:04] I'm sure our sin and we shall go for us
[1:14:10] praise the Lord glory be to God churches
[1:14:22] is becoming the faster growing business
[1:14:30] because as long as we can we can follow
[1:14:33] the church with good instruments we can
[1:14:35] put the musicians on salary and bring
[1:14:38] committees in a leaner comedians into
[1:14:41] the church and just entertain the people
[1:14:44] just get a hold of them for 10 minutes
[1:14:47] because we are living in such a busy
[1:14:51] fast growing fast growing our our our
[1:14:56] age our our age we are living in it's a
[1:14:59] drive true age church now is just like a

[1:15:28] praise the Lord

[1:15:37] mockery out of churches they horrible
[1:15:39] things about church speaking the name of

[1:16:57] evil desire even children that can build
[1:17:01] their babies they will not mind but

[1:17:05] an evil spirit
[1:17:15] who shall go for us where is the home
[1:17:20] that is going to come back to a biblical
[1:17:21] principle what the Bible would be on the
[1:17:24] table we will remind ourself of the
[1:17:29] commandment of God we will read a
[1:17:30] scripture and we will seek the face of
[1:17:33] the law or is the home in this society
[1:17:42] the society the word that we are living
[1:17:45] in people think is money that keeps
[1:17:47] family together I am Telling You there

[1:19:04] they really had a plane but many of the
[1:19:08] time the truck we will not we will not
[1:19:10] get there so if we can put the vision
[1:19:13] fire maybe we might not get them all as
[1:19:17] we are getting closer we can be able to
[1:19:20] develop and become better but here we
[1:19:23] are 2020

[1:20:09] happy things were happy praise the Lord
[1:20:13] things were happy and the ages will roll
[1:20:16] back but one of these days time will be
[1:20:19] swallowed up into eternity praise the
[1:20:25] Lord and the wicked will cease to exist
[1:20:34] according to Malachi 4 the ranchers
[1:20:37] would come and walk on the ashes of the
[1:20:39] wicked praise the Lord
[1:20:46] whom shall go for us we're trying to
[1:20:52] give you a little picture to see the
[1:20:58] timeline Jesus spoke in the gospel that
[1:21:03] this gospel would go to the four corners
[1:21:04] of the earth before his coming and we
[1:21:10] have witnessed it
[1:21:12] praise the Lord I have an app on my
[1:21:15] phone that has the Bible in in almost
[1:21:18] every language on the heaven almost
[1:21:25] every language on the heaven praise the
[1:21:32] Lord
[1:21:35] and I say blessed be that person I
[1:21:38] invested their time to be able to work
[1:21:43] on their almost every language on the
[1:21:46] heaven Jesus said in Matthew chapter 24
[1:21:53] because iniquity shall abound the love
[1:21:59] of God will go coal in the hearts of men
[1:22:03] because they increase of wickedness we
[1:22:10] increase in gold very cool and we were
[1:22:14] just trying to look at that little
[1:22:16] introvert just like it was in the days
[1:22:18] of Noah it was a period of time were
[1:22:22] seven days interpret I was giving to
[1:22:26] their age and nobody could go into the
[1:22:28] ark and nobody could come out of the ark
[1:22:31] praise the Lord and the Bible says you
[1:22:35] know and Lord had it that way until
[1:22:37] finally the law closed that I can seal
[1:22:40] Noah and those that were in the act we
[1:22:42] are living in such a time were we
[1:22:46] believe from scriptures and the things
[1:22:48] that are happening that grace is about
[1:22:53] returning to the Jews we have to know
[1:22:57] that Jesus said that as the likely goes
[1:23:06] from the east to the where so the coming
[1:23:08] of the Lord will be amen the gospel is
[1:23:14] going back to the Jews pretty soon God
[1:23:16] will be able to do bring a redemptive
[1:23:19] work and bring a woman around for four
[1:23:21] thousand out of there or for we Gentiles
[1:23:25] Jen tied days a beginning to close look
[1:23:32] at church life it's not like what it
[1:23:34] used to be it's just all about formality
[1:23:40] and faction
[1:23:43] it looks like we come to church in the
[1:23:46] church word it's just all about
[1:23:49] tradition people come to you know sure
[1:23:52] what they have instead of coming to seek
[1:23:55] the God of heaven in earth we should go
[1:24:01] for us just talking with some brothers
[1:24:05] and we were talking about because the
[1:24:09] church have experienced prayers that
[1:24:14] have not been answered people has prayed
[1:24:20] and pray ask God for things you tell me
[1:24:26] if we were getting down on our knees and
[1:24:28] seeking the face of God and God answer
[1:24:31] your prayer the next time you have a
[1:24:32] trouble that's where you are going
[1:24:36] praise the Lord
[1:24:38] but while we don't pray because we just
[1:24:40] feel that well you know pain is just a
[1:24:42] religion things that we recite that's
[1:24:47] why that you know they will write you
[1:24:48] prayer for you to read and this dead and
[1:24:51] when prayer is supposed to be a man
[1:24:53] putting out his heart to God trust in
[1:24:58] God now asking God and looking for
[1:25:02] solution that's why we have made prayer
[1:25:05] to me
[1:25:07] God please help me because I'm planning
[1:25:10] to do this you already have your plans
[1:25:14] and because of unanswered prayers it has
[1:25:21] killed a fervent desire for people to
[1:25:24] seek God to believe that there is a
[1:25:27] Living God a God that can answer prayers
[1:25:30] all of those things have taken fasting
[1:25:34] and praying away from from from the
[1:25:35] house of God and from the life of Chris
[1:25:37] things fresh law
[1:25:51] who shall vote for us if the church will
[1:25:55] remain the Church of Jesus Christ we
[1:25:58] should go for us
[1:26:00] praise the Lord amen
[1:26:05] oh we want the back of us back in our
[1:26:08] may say me we're seeing talked twice
[1:26:15] before he went to church because he will
[1:26:20] he will be caught out those early
[1:26:25] Christians were people than they
[1:26:27] believed you just think about what
[1:26:31] happened after Jesus left they had to
[1:26:37] believe that he was a living God and
[1:26:41] living among his people the Bible says
[1:26:45] they went from house to house breaking
[1:26:46] bread every service every evening
[1:26:49] service was a communion for them why
[1:26:52] because they wanted a reality of God
[1:26:55] India miss they wanted to feel the
[1:26:59] presence of the God I said I will never
[1:27:02] leave you I will never forsake you
[1:27:07] praise the Lord
[1:27:09] I want us to think about this this
[1:27:14] morning before we close this service
[1:27:22] let's think about it this morning with
[1:27:25] all our different resolution that we
[1:27:30] might have made for this year we shall
[1:27:35] go for us and whom shall I sing praise
[1:27:42] the Lord there's some things I was read
[1:27:45] to you this morning and just trying to
[1:27:47] keep it in this evangelistic away this
[1:27:50] morning but you realize as I chapter one
[1:27:54] the scripture says and I saw the Lord
[1:27:58] sitting upon a throne high and lifted up
[1:28:03] in his tree
[1:28:05] fill the tempura what was that train his
[1:28:09] train filled the temple and you know how
[1:28:12] to train moves the Train one bucket is
[1:28:16] connected to another bucket and it's
[1:28:19] connected to another bucket and it's
[1:28:21] connected to another bucket so that the
[1:28:24] train that filled the temple was was the
[1:28:29] surfing's of the angels their wings
[1:28:32] tipping to one another and it were
[1:28:35] moving so fast now watch what Isaiah
[1:28:40] said here he said I saw the Lord sitting
[1:28:44] upon his throne high and lifted up amen
[1:28:49] so right over there
[1:28:52] there was a moving of the angels I mean
[1:28:55] moving so fast so fast praise the Lord
[1:29:01] now and we and we were realized that if
[1:29:04] you take this back you will see there
[1:29:07] you go over to the Book of Ezekiel you
[1:29:10] will see the same thing that Ezekiel saw
[1:29:12] the angels those Charming's in in the
[1:29:15] temple before the throne of God praise
[1:29:18] the law and then with what Ezekiel
[1:29:21] identified as as the child being one
[1:29:24] having the face of a man and another one
[1:29:26] the face upon the ego and all of these
[1:29:28] different faces their heart you will
[1:29:30] realize the very first time that a Bible
[1:29:32] spoke about a cherubim was in the Garden
[1:29:35] of Eden when man brought the Word of God
[1:29:39] when he's seen it against God the Bible
[1:29:42] says and the Lord put cherry beans in
[1:29:45] there in the Garden of Eden to keep the
[1:29:48] Tree of Life
[1:29:52] so that that has been the protection to
[1:29:56] the church that's the reason why dearly
[1:30:03] in the scientist ed he give his angels
[1:30:06] charge over us right from the Garden of
[1:30:11] Eden
[1:30:11] they are always supernatural angels
[1:30:14] around the people of God
[1:30:23] the work of salvation is not a work of
[1:30:26] men's hands when God promised to keep us
[1:30:29] and protect us it's now what we can do
[1:30:32] if he keep if he promise to keep us
[1:30:36] healthy it's now our health insurance
[1:30:42] praise the Lord because right from Eden
[1:30:46] since man fell from God he promised
[1:30:49] whenever he comes back to the tree of
[1:30:52] life there will be angels and come about
[1:30:54] him praise the Lord amen
[1:31:04] so the church has traveled this way
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:13] on the full side Ezekiel in the Book of
[1:31:18] Ezekiel he brought it out more more
[1:31:20] Clara with a lot of identification one
[1:31:23] had the face of an ego the other one had
[1:31:25] a face of a lion one had the face of a
[1:31:28] man and the fourth one had the face of
[1:31:30] an ox now so these these these turbines
[1:31:34] he called him and they had their wings
[1:31:39] locked together one facing this way one
[1:31:43] facing this way one foot in that way one
[1:31:46] facing this other way and if they should
[1:31:48] move they move in this direction or the
[1:31:52] move in this direction they moved this
[1:31:54] way and move this way when they are
[1:31:57] going this way and if it is the face of
[1:31:59] a man all of your strength is behind the
[1:32:03] face of a man if the eleven were all of
[1:32:08] this word all of the anointing of that
[1:32:11] of an ego they unite gets trained and
[1:32:13] aghoris an ego they don't break apart
[1:32:18] they move together like that praise the
[1:32:23] Lord
[1:32:24] let me read something a little bit to
[1:32:26] you from revelation series it will help
[1:32:28] you now watch this whenever
[1:32:31] when now to go the win and the turn net
[1:32:35] weather when they could in turn if they
[1:32:40] was going this way it was going like a
[1:32:44] man this one does not turn no he had
[1:32:48] this guy behind him to take care of
[1:32:50] whatever is there when which direction
[1:32:55] they are going the goals in that
[1:32:56] direction and Bill's honor death
[1:32:58] anointing
[1:33:00] praise the Lord
[1:33:02] Ezekiel call them turbans but we were
[1:33:05] father in the book of Revelation there
[1:33:07] they are the anointing that has been
[1:33:09] guiding the church the anointing that
[1:33:12] God has kept his people on earth because
[1:33:15] is the anointing that breaks the York is
[1:33:18] the anointing that does the work is the
[1:33:21] anointing that changed our lives
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:30] praise the Lord
[1:33:32] that's the reason why you find people we
[1:33:36] they come to church they tried to
[1:33:38] practice to become a good Christian you
[1:33:41] don't practice it you don't go to school
[1:33:43] to learn it amen
[1:33:48] God comes down and he get a hold of you
[1:33:52] he gets you into that cycle and when
[1:33:56] it's moving you have to move that's the
[1:33:58] reason why sometimes you behave in you
[1:34:00] don't even know why you behave the way
[1:34:02] you behave and because you are not in
[1:34:05] control of it it's something that is in
[1:34:08] control of you that's what a Christian
[1:34:10] life is praise the Lord
[1:34:24] amen so God has protected his church can
[1:34:32] you remember in The Book of Numbers when
[1:34:35] the people were growing out of out of
[1:34:36] the promised land they were traveling
[1:34:38] down there and had to go by the way of
[1:34:40] the land of more and Balaam by like the
[1:34:44] king higher bill and to come and curse
[1:34:46] these people just a little group of
[1:34:48] people that mean that there were not
[1:34:49] classy people that just a small group of
[1:34:52] people led by a prophet Moses they never
[1:34:55] had an army praise the Lord because God
[1:34:59] promised that I would send my angel for
[1:35:02] before you amen it was not a different
[1:35:06] angel it was the angel rifle Genesis
[1:35:10] that was promised to keep the church or
[1:35:12] that is the reason why it does not fear
[1:35:15] us to say dangers a year this morning
[1:35:18] because we know it's angels that are
[1:35:21] keeping us since Eden God has always
[1:35:29] associate dangers supernatural healing
[1:35:33] deliverance because those are the
[1:35:36] attributes those are the things that are
[1:35:39] in God and they're for your benefit
[1:35:42] praise the Lord God don't need to be
[1:35:45] heal he don't need to be here he's just
[1:35:49] a healer to heal you praise the Lord
[1:35:54] he don't need to be delivered that's why
[1:35:58] he's the deliverer to deliver you praise
[1:36:07] the Lord oh my what a wonderful God we
[1:36:11] say Amen I read something a little bit a
[1:36:16] game from revelation series sorry I got
[1:36:19] I got a little bit caravan dealing I
[1:36:21] didn't send those things back there to
[1:36:23] back it so but if you want them I can
[1:36:25] share them with you craz the Lord amen
[1:36:28] now he beheld the living in just behold
[1:36:30] one one will upon the earth about a
[1:36:34] living angel now you have you have to
[1:36:36] see it was Ezekiel talks
[1:36:38] by the wheels in the middle of the
[1:36:39] wheels I mean there was one wheel and
[1:36:42] another wheel and another wheel and
[1:36:44] another wheel praise Allah just watch
[1:36:46] this now he says here with his four
[1:36:52] faces and in the appearance their work
[1:36:56] was like coal burning and and and they
[1:37:03] have four and therefore how one likeness
[1:37:07] and their appearance and their work it
[1:37:10] was a wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:37:14] what the symbol what what is the symbol
[1:37:17] about what is it it means that these
[1:37:21] guys now you see that is the reason why
[1:37:23] even the New Testament open with Matthew
[1:37:28] Mark Luke and John the Full Gospel now
[1:37:34] and if you read the four Gospels
[1:37:36] what are they talking about I don't want
[1:37:39] talking about the same story it just a
[1:37:42] much you presented a little bit
[1:37:44] different Mac presented a little bit
[1:37:47] different praise the Lord
[1:37:49] now you will realize that it's only in
[1:37:52] Matthew the book of Matthew Margie is
[1:37:55] the older one that spoke about the three
[1:37:58] wise men
[1:38:01] why because much you honor his anointing
[1:38:05] he saw Jesus inspiration his anointing
[1:38:08] was presenting Jesus the king praise the
[1:38:14] Lord
[1:38:15] mark in his gospel when he talked about
[1:38:19] the Lord Jesus he goes back to a Jeremy
[1:38:23] of prophecy where the Bible talks about
[1:38:25] Jehovah seven so mark present Jesus like
[1:38:30] a seven praise Allah
[1:38:36] in him go to the Gospel of Luke when
[1:38:41] Luke starts to talk about Jesus
[1:38:43] now you will realize they even look was
[1:38:46] now one of the disciples he was not a
[1:38:50] twelve disciple
[1:38:51] this was a learned man this was a
[1:38:54] physician by Korea praise the Lord
[1:38:59] it brings us honor the mains anointing
[1:39:03] men's intelligence milk yields his
[1:39:09] intelligent by the report that he
[1:39:11] gathered to be able to write a testimony
[1:39:14] of Jesus Christ what are we talking
[1:39:20] about people who should go for us this
[1:39:26] man they gave their life to the cause of
[1:39:29] the gospel they were not playing with
[1:39:32] God in your life leave a son alive in
[1:39:37] and enter the rest of the time honor
[1:39:39] some kind of for influence let me tell
[1:39:41] you God has the greatest influence the
[1:39:46] power of the influence of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:49] in more than the drug I mean this Holy
[1:39:53] Ghost can intoxicate you better than an
[1:39:57] alcohol can do because when the alcohol
[1:40:01] get out of you you remember all your
[1:40:03] sorrow is just like a new it goes even
[1:40:14] in your sorrow you still have joy Oh
[1:40:23] what are we talking about and when John
[1:40:26] wrote about Jesus low-riding in John
[1:40:30] chapter 1 well he says in the beginning
[1:40:33] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:40:35] and the war was good I mean he was
[1:40:39] talking about things that have nothing
[1:40:42] to do with her baby in the manger come
[1:40:46] on people
[1:40:49] he's not talking about a baby in the
[1:40:51] manger
[1:40:52] he's not talking about joe said he's not
[1:40:54] talking about Mary he's talking about
[1:40:57] God in the beginning
[1:40:58] and all things was created by him
[1:41:01] him nothing was created the word that
[1:41:05] was in the beginning became flesh and
[1:41:06] dwelt among us that was his testimony oh
[1:41:10] there was some Eagles at 19 taking us in
[1:41:15] the height praise the Lord
[1:41:23] boy every one of them was talking about
[1:41:28] Jesus talking about his ministry John is
[1:41:33] the only person that talks about you
[1:41:34] must be born again John chapter 3 he's
[1:41:37] the only person that talks about the
[1:41:38] comforter he's the only person that
[1:41:40] talks about the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:41:42] girls who come in order why because he
[1:41:48] was on a different anointing amen and
[1:41:52] everything that John speaks about the
[1:41:55] rest of the Gospels supported everything
[1:41:58] that Matthew speaks about the rest of
[1:42:00] the gospel supported because that's how
[1:42:02] there's four beats move when one move
[1:42:05] everybody stand behind it praise the
[1:42:09] Lord
[1:42:10] even go Luke was not a disciple but
[1:42:13] everything he spoke about the rest of
[1:42:14] the gospel supported because it was God
[1:42:21] it's the word of God my my my
[1:42:26] praise the Lord are we together are you
[1:42:31] ready for 2020 are you ready for 2020

[1:44:27] the funny thing when people call me on
[1:44:29] the phone I don't want to them I run to
[1:44:31] the church to pray praise the Lord so
[1:44:35] you will have to be dealing with it on
[1:44:37] terror until help comes on the way
[1:44:39] because our helps come from the Lord our
[1:44:42] helps does not comes from man it comes

[1:45:56] you praise the Lord
[1:46:05] amen
[1:46:07] I'm just saying Happy New Year that's
[1:46:09] all I'm saying and now even stop
[1:46:11] preaching it I'm just telling you Happy
[1:46:13] New Year
[1:46:15] praise the Lord are you ready for 2020
[1:46:19] oh my glory be to God
[1:46:23] amen if God is God you answer by fire
[1:46:29] and he can answer by fire praise the
[1:46:33] Lord
[1:46:33] that's a that's a that's a that's a Lord
[1:46:36] in nature there's a Lord in nature you
[1:46:43] you go to every religion they believe
[1:46:47] that God is one it's just there they
[1:46:51] have different ways to explain it I mean
[1:46:56] even in Christianity we would say some
[1:47:01] we say he's one God but yet he's he's
[1:47:06] three they have different ways you go to
[1:47:09] the Buddhist is because one it's a very
[1:47:13] unique number amen
[1:47:17] and it shows the kind of a point out to
[1:47:23] to to the deity it speaks of a
[1:47:29] supernatural intelligence there is one
[1:47:33] beyond every
[1:47:35] power and none can be compared praise
[1:47:40] the Lord
[1:47:41] - always speaks about confirmation
[1:47:45] praise the Lord that is the reason why
[1:47:48] you never found one man to the author
[1:47:50] for them to bless him because it takes
[1:47:53] two to hard to agree that we want to
[1:47:56] make a family for a to STATS
[1:47:59] so what whatever to agreed upon amen
[1:48:06] - is always the number of agreement
[1:48:12] praise the Lord
[1:48:18] even though I don't want to go into all
[1:48:21] of these things
[1:48:22] praise the Lord people marry their
[1:48:27] homeland marry different things and when
[1:48:30] they they alone say the bow
[1:48:31] so it's upon them alone to keep the
[1:48:34] commitment and not on the other one
[1:48:38] agreement does not work like that
[1:48:40] whatsoever - agreed upon praise the Lord
[1:48:47] three speaks of a number of completion
[1:48:53] in some sense for biblically who see it
[1:48:59] as a number of protection delivering
[1:49:02] five speaks of grace six it's the number
[1:49:09] of men praise the Lord the reason why
[1:49:13] I'm coming in two days because in Isaiah
[1:49:16] chapter six there were six dangers six
[1:49:20] Serafin and you see that it's a
[1:49:25] universal number it's a universal number
[1:49:28] the Bible in the book of Revelation also
[1:49:31] speaks about it they say is the number
[1:49:32] of a man he died have wisdom that he
[1:49:35] count the number of a man but it's a
[1:49:39] universal number praise the Lord six is
[1:49:43] so much identified two men that when he
[1:49:46] dies they put him six feet
[1:49:49] it's so much identified two men is all
[1:49:52] over the world who wrote that it's
[1:49:56] written in an unwritten law it's so much
[1:50:02] identified two men that even when they
[1:50:05] escort his coffin is all it's always six
[1:50:08] person no matter how big he is no matter
[1:50:13] how tall he is it's always made for six
[1:50:17] person to ask Ari why because it's the
[1:50:20] number of name now you will see that God
[1:50:25] is so unique in his word and the things
[1:50:29] that he does there those things lay
[1:50:32] there and and and and may want to use
[1:50:36] the thing that God has placed in nature
[1:50:40] to prove that he's wise the
[1:50:44] psychologists and all of these people
[1:50:46] they just use reasoning from nature they
[1:50:50] don't want the God of creation but they
[1:50:53] want his great wisdom to solve their
[1:50:56] problem praise the Lord
[1:50:59] now this this experience that Isaiah had
[1:51:03] is so much attached to us that God had
[1:51:09] to witness about six angels six
[1:51:13] surfing's the reason is because you will
[1:51:17] see it read from Isaiah chapter one if
[1:51:20] you know if you don't have a Bible
[1:51:21] reading that you have started here let
[1:51:23] me give you one start reading from
[1:51:24] Isaiah chapter one and then as you go
[1:51:27] alone and get to a chapter 6 chapter 5 a
[1:51:32] chapter 4 you will see there in chapter
[1:51:36] 4 is where he talked about the branch of
[1:51:39] the Lord will be glorious in chapter 4
[1:51:42] he talks about how seven women will hold
[1:51:45] on to one man and in all of those things
[1:51:48] but when he comes to this chapter six
[1:51:52] after he had this experience with the
[1:51:55] danger
[1:51:57] his message change
[1:52:02] Prison Law it's right in in Chapter 7
[1:52:06] verse 9 the first time he would talk
[1:52:09] about a virgin shall conceive or he will
[1:52:13] speak about I'll give you a sign
[1:52:18] amen as I had 7:14 did the prophecy of a
[1:52:25] virgin conceived you will see how that
[1:52:29] experience in Isaiah chapter 6 affecting
[1:52:32] his life so much until he started
[1:52:35] prophesying about the redemption of man
[1:52:42] praise the Lord
[1:52:46] influence him it lifted him so high in
[1:52:50] his ministry the Isaiah is the only
[1:52:54] Bible prophet and the book in the Bible
[1:52:58] that covered the entire Bible since the
[1:53:03] sixth chapter he's the one that spoke
[1:53:07] about how Lucifer fell from heaven he
[1:53:14] spoke about the Millennial he spoke
[1:53:17] about the the the end of the world
[1:53:22] that's that experience that he had
[1:53:24] lifting him so high praise the Lord amen
[1:53:35] and that's exactly what God was going to
[1:53:42] do to the human race amen
[1:53:48] man was going to come into such an
[1:53:52] experience with the a maker well God
[1:53:57] will not just be a theory that we can
[1:53:59] pass down he will be what we can
[1:54:03] experience praise the Lord
[1:54:07] we can experience him in our body in our
[1:54:11] lives in our homes praise the Lord
[1:54:18] musicians you can come forward we'll be
[1:54:21] back this evening let me not keep you
[1:54:22] too long amen
[1:54:26] actually you say you ready for 2020
[1:54:40] back there God brought 7-6 Angels and
[1:54:44] the higher their wings all thither to
[1:54:47] one another and it was spinning moving
[1:54:50] in such a fast move now as I said their
[1:54:53] tree filled the temple because they were
[1:54:56] moving so fast
[1:54:59] praise the Lord go back to history you
[1:55:03] come to come we have a little picture
[1:55:05] out there in the aisle when you enter
[1:55:08] the building that picture was taken by
[1:55:15] the photograph people that loved nature
[1:55:18] and when they see things in the heavens
[1:55:20] they like to take it going over
[1:55:24] horizonal and over the the Mexican
[1:55:27] desert and it was just moving in the
[1:55:29] heaven and were cloud that was moving so
[1:55:33] fast
[1:55:34] by the way angel's wings take it
[1:55:38] together
[1:55:45] praise the Lord
[1:55:51] and just like how those six angels were
[1:55:56] sent to influence the life of this
[1:55:58] prophet to bring us prophecy of a
[1:56:03] Redemption prophecy of the Millennium
[1:56:06] gave us prophecy of the fold of the
[1:56:08] devil take us back to time even when
[1:56:11] there was there was no time that's the
[1:56:15] same way this time seven angels came
[1:56:19] with the earth influence and they had a
[1:56:23] message
[1:56:29] when man fell in the Garden of Eden God
[1:56:33] protected the truth of life with angels
[1:56:37] he called them children when Jesus was
[1:56:42] born he just came down and told the
[1:56:46] shippers it was injures that told the
[1:56:49] shipper the king Gisborne
[1:56:52] [Music]

[1:58:15] terrified he was affected by the
[1:58:18] presence he was not justifying himself
[1:58:22] he was not trying to find reason why he
