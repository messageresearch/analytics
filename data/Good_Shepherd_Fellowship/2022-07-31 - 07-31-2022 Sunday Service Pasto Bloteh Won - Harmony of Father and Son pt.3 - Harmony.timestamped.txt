[49:12] we love you we appreciate your father in
[49:15] jesus name we pray

[49:23] hallelujah
[49:25] praise the lord amen we thank the lawful
[49:28] uh this privilege that we have and let's
[49:32] just go right into the word
[49:34] and
[49:35] i'm i'm a little bit nervous this
[49:37] morning
[49:38] because i don't have all my stuff
[49:40] together
[49:42] so uh i will depend on you to do the
[49:45] preaching amen
[49:47] i'm just going to stand on stand here
[49:49] then and uh depend on you for you to do
[49:53] the preaching do the pulling do do
[49:55] everything and
[49:56] uh if the service turned out well
[50:00] let's give praise to the lord and
[50:01] realize that you did the work amen
[50:04] praise the lord
[50:06] amen and
[50:07] as we said that this uh uh
[50:10] evening we want to come back for the
[50:13] little prayer meeting and the communion
[50:15] service
[50:16] uh uh
[50:21] realizing that a lot of our
[50:24] uh first
[50:28] weekend in the month uh being taken by
[50:30] one thing or another
[50:33] the young people will be gone this first
[50:36] weekend for the youth uh
[50:37] banquet i also have some
[50:40] taxing services coming up this uh
[50:44] weekend in harare i should be having
[50:47] about six meetings
[50:49] and i really really need the grace of
[50:51] god because i don't have the human
[50:52] strength for some reason i'm just
[50:55] becoming very very tired i think it's a
[50:58] lot of things on my mind but i pray that
[51:00] the law will
[51:02] will just give strength
[51:04] and uh
[51:09] and then uh
[51:10] september there's this wedding
[51:13] brother robert wilson in chicago asked
[51:15] me to help them
[51:16] uh there to know the family there that
[51:20] uh
[51:21] the sister i think they drove down your
[51:23] one time for service sister rose and her
[51:25] daughter
[51:26] be getting married so uh uh we will be
[51:29] helping them with the services there
[51:31] so i just thought okay it would be good
[51:34] for us to just come together this
[51:37] evening and have a little prayer meeting
[51:40] and
[51:41] remember the lord
[51:43] in the word of communion tonight
[51:46] praise the lord
[51:48] and
[51:48] another reason did is that
[51:51] uh
[51:52] while i was going away that was i was
[51:54] preaching somewhere and that evening i
[51:57] was actually going to speak on the on
[51:59] the on the message
[52:04] the sunday morning i preach
[52:06] for brother elijah you know he's uh
[52:09] familiar to many of us here
[52:12] and then the evening i was going to go
[52:14] to
[52:15] one of the next uh province as we will
[52:18] call it that way
[52:20] and pray for brother moses there but
[52:23] in the morning
[52:25] there was
[52:26] [Music]
[52:28] a relative to my
[52:31] senior brother that passed that morning
[52:33] so they were going to go there and and
[52:36] they didn't wanted to
[52:38] uh to be away so we cancelled the
[52:40] service and and the brother had to
[52:42] change his uh
[52:44] weekly service to accommodate me
[52:47] i think on tuesday
[52:49] uh since i was i was going to be living
[52:51] out there soon
[52:54] so uh
[52:56] but then while i was growing that i had
[52:58] this thought on my mind to talk i was
[53:00] going to actually speak on the
[53:03] the
[53:04] the importance of the three
[53:07] ordinances that jesus left with the new
[53:10] testament church
[53:11] the importance of the three ordinances
[53:14] which is water baptizing communion and
[53:16] fault washing
[53:18] and
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] one reason was to encourage those group
[53:24] of believers
[53:25] and and also uh bring some structural
[53:29] approach to that subject
[53:32] because like brother branham said key in
[53:34] the door that's that those are some of
[53:36] the things that
[53:38] uh i didn't put together this morning it
[53:41] will all going to be part of
[53:43] my introduction before i get into the
[53:45] message i want to preach
[53:48] but he said
[53:49] you know
[53:50] the subject of communion
[53:54] became a big subject in the early church
[53:57] it was not as as big as when
[54:01] after catholicism took over
[54:03] because we realized that it was
[54:05] something that was very common in the
[54:07] book of acts with the early believers
[54:09] because the bible says they went from
[54:11] house to house breaking bread
[54:13] and uh
[54:15] in a way that we understand the history
[54:17] of the early church every time they
[54:19] gather they use that to commune with the
[54:22] lord sit up a little bit better than
[54:24] that michael
[54:25] and they use that to to commune you know
[54:29] to remember the lord every time they
[54:31] gather they'll have a service you know
[54:33] at the end of the evening they will they
[54:35] will remember the law that way
[54:37] and then uh as as time went on uh the
[54:40] church adopted
[54:42] uh having communion on the first the
[54:45] first sunday
[54:46] in honor of the resurrection you know
[54:49] and a lot of you but then when
[54:53] catholicism took over
[54:55] uh uh there were a lot of things that
[54:57] were introduced into the church
[55:00] and uh and that's when
[55:02] uh it started to become
[55:05] a
[55:07] communion actually for for the new
[55:09] testament church started to take another
[55:12] shape it tells us to take another form
[55:14] why because
[55:18] catholicism introduced uh the teaching
[55:22] of communion
[55:23] as partaking of the literal body
[55:28] of jesus christ
[55:30] and as common as that may sound to you
[55:35] it is
[55:36] it is very very important very very
[55:40] uh it has a whole weight because
[55:44] uh uh catholic catalysing does dostnet
[55:48] it does not take that lightly they don't
[55:50] take it for granted
[55:53] to them is very is very serious
[55:57] and the dogma that is behind there that
[55:59] is dangerous
[56:01] is that
[56:04] with jesus word except you eat my flesh
[56:07] and drink my blood you have no life in
[56:10] you
[56:12] the catholic church adopted the teaching
[56:15] that
[56:18] by the instruction of the pope
[56:21] the catholic priest has the power
[56:24] to be able to take that little
[56:27] wiffle that is in his hands and wave
[56:30] some enchantment
[56:34] and and prayer to change there
[56:38] to the literal body
[56:40] of jesus christ
[56:43] praise the lord
[56:45] and
[56:46] and
[56:47] the
[56:48] the church has been so brainwashed
[56:54] it has been so brainwashed
[56:57] this whole subject i've read about it
[57:00] you know i'll read a few quotes from
[57:01] brother branham and read a little bit on
[57:03] church history but it really did not hit
[57:06] me
[57:07] until late late i i went through a book
[57:11] 50 year in the church of rome
[57:15] when i got when i went through that book
[57:18] because
[57:21] the altar of the book actually was a
[57:23] catholic priest just like luther was a
[57:26] priest and and all of these different
[57:27] men that god used through through the
[57:29] church ages
[57:31] but
[57:32] you will realize that
[57:35] because god has a specific work
[57:39] for
[57:39] every one of us
[57:42] there's a unique work
[57:44] and it's it's more like like uh charles
[57:47] chinoque was
[57:48] was raised up and placed in the
[57:52] the catholic system
[57:54] just to be able to bring us some
[57:57] some uh some information behind the dark
[58:00] curtains that you and myself who have
[58:02] never known about
[58:04] now brother brennan referenced charles
[58:06] chinook in a message
[58:07] paul the prisoner
[58:09] uh if you want to go instead and find it
[58:12] you will find it there
[58:14] and uh
[58:17] and it's it's it just it opened my mind
[58:20] to
[58:21] areas where you were just overlooked
[58:24] and
[58:25] and and and that alone
[58:28] took me back to started going again and
[58:31] studying on the subject of communion
[58:33] and because
[58:35] just like how the the catholic has that
[58:38] dogma to believe
[58:40] that and it's very strongly belief
[58:45] it's a very strong dogma
[58:49] that
[58:52] affect the people so much
[58:55] and i mean because of time there are
[58:57] things i would not want to go into
[58:59] uh but then
[59:01] brother branham in the message key to
[59:03] the doll he says you know the catholic
[59:05] believe that the the communion is uh is
[59:08] partaking of the literal body of jesus
[59:10] christ and he says that's what uh uh
[59:15] separate the catholic from the
[59:16] protesting because the protestants do
[59:19] believe that
[59:21] the communion is just a symbol
[59:24] praise the lord amen
[59:27] and then
[59:29] and then brother branham also went on
[59:31] talking about
[59:32] uh
[59:35] also there's there's a group of people
[59:37] that also believe that
[59:39] [Music]
[59:42] we do take spiritual communion every
[59:45] time we come to church
[59:48] praise the lord we do take spiritual
[59:51] communion because the communion
[59:52] represents the body of the lord which
[59:54] which of course is the word
[59:57] amen
[59:58] so every time we come to fellowship
[1:00:00] every time we come to service we are
[1:00:02] actually having a communion service
[1:00:05] we are communing with the lord do you
[1:00:07] believe that
[1:00:09] praise the lord we we are communion with
[1:00:11] the lord every time we come to service
[1:00:14] now so
[1:00:16] you you have all of those things
[1:00:20] and there's a group of people
[1:00:22] that are so comfortable with their
[1:00:24] spiritual communion
[1:00:26] that uh that the the literal ordinance
[1:00:31] of communion
[1:00:33] is gradually growing away from the
[1:00:35] church
[1:00:36] even in message churches
[1:00:41] because of the fact that we we have the
[1:00:44] word we have the open book
[1:00:46] we have the reveal word
[1:00:49] and every time we are feeding on the
[1:00:50] word we are not feeding on dogma we are
[1:00:52] feeding on the body word of the son of
[1:00:54] man
[1:00:56] and we can we can put all of those
[1:00:58] quotes together
[1:01:02] so
[1:01:04] that that literal audience is is
[1:01:06] beginning to fade away and i will talk a
[1:01:08] little bit on that to this evening and
[1:01:10] what i will read some quotes
[1:01:13] and then
[1:01:15] you have
[1:01:16] this other group of people
[1:01:18] that
[1:01:19] have a bit of a
[1:01:22] catholic mind that looks at the the you
[1:01:26] know the the the communion the you know
[1:01:28] the communion bread you know that is is
[1:01:31] is a it's a sacred thing
[1:01:33] and uh and and that's the body of the
[1:01:35] lord
[1:01:36] you know uh uh so
[1:01:39] when it comes to
[1:01:40] uh fulfilling the literal ordinance they
[1:01:43] are afraid of it they don't want to
[1:01:45] touch it they don't want to come close
[1:01:46] to it
[1:01:50] praise the lord
[1:01:52] amen and and even when it come close to
[1:01:55] to taking uh a communion they come with
[1:01:59] uh you know uh
[1:02:01] uh you know uh
[1:02:04] you know reverence and you know when
[1:02:06] and
[1:02:07] stay there and you know say their
[1:02:09] prayers and and you know uh uh
[1:02:12] lord i'm taking your body in you know
[1:02:14] your your body into my
[1:02:16] your blood and body into my body lord
[1:02:18] you know and just that mind
[1:02:22] but i believe that it's a carryover from
[1:02:24] capitalism
[1:02:27] i believe there is a balance
[1:02:30] i believe there is a place
[1:02:33] that we have to come to that's right
[1:02:35] it's true that paul warn us
[1:02:38] that uh we must
[1:02:40] examine ourselves by the word we must
[1:02:42] look at our our sacrifice amen
[1:02:47] as we
[1:02:48] examine ourselves
[1:02:52] he says for this cause some are sick
[1:02:55] you know uh some are dead and you know
[1:02:57] different things happen you know if we
[1:02:59] if we take the communion on walter lee
[1:03:03] we must never take it for granted
[1:03:07] praise the lord
[1:03:08] amen
[1:03:09] because it has its place in the local
[1:03:13] church
[1:03:17] but we we must also never take the
[1:03:19] communion
[1:03:21] over the world
[1:03:24] praise the lord
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:27] what do i say there is the other
[1:03:29] if we will get to the place where we
[1:03:32] have so much reference for their
[1:03:34] physical ordinance and we can come to
[1:03:37] church
[1:03:39] sit in service fee comfortable with our
[1:03:42] indifferences
[1:03:44] sit on of the preaching of the word
[1:03:46] and don't hear it
[1:03:48] but then when it comes to communion
[1:03:50] service then we escape
[1:03:52] it's an idol
[1:03:54] it's idolatry
[1:03:58] because you are taking that literal
[1:04:00] ordinance above the word
[1:04:03] and there is no ordinance that is above
[1:04:05] the word of god
[1:04:10] you see what i'm going with this
[1:04:15] praise the lord
[1:04:16] it's almost like a person that will that
[1:04:19] will that will uh
[1:04:21] want a water bath tasting
[1:04:26] and uh and then we be baptized in the
[1:04:28] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:04:33] which is uh uh uh that represent the
[1:04:37] death burial and uh resurrection of
[1:04:39] jesus
[1:04:42] christ lord
[1:04:45] and then after being identified with
[1:04:47] that symbol
[1:04:50] they will not want to take the
[1:04:52] correction from god's word
[1:04:55] because we are watched
[1:04:57] by the watching of the word
[1:05:11] praise the lord so you see those
[1:05:14] ordinances are placed in the church they
[1:05:16] have their place in their church they
[1:05:18] must they must never be overlooked
[1:05:23] praise the lord
[1:05:24] they must never be overlooked in in no
[1:05:27] way we must not we must not neglect them
[1:05:30] and also we must not uh
[1:05:33] uh
[1:05:34] you know we must not we must not be
[1:05:36] careless
[1:05:39] as we approached him
[1:05:42] because we to all the ordinance of god
[1:05:46] there is blessing and cursing
[1:05:48] that is attached to it
[1:05:54] praise the lord
[1:05:56] there is blessing
[1:05:59] and curses that i attached to it
[1:06:06] and uh
[1:06:08] those are some of the things
[1:06:10] that uh
[1:06:16] i was thinking about
[1:06:19] and i thought that i will
[1:06:24] actually wanted to take a service and
[1:06:26] speak on there
[1:06:29] but i i also had this scripture on my
[1:06:32] mind
[1:06:36] praise the lord
[1:06:38] deuteronomy chapter
[1:06:41] 7.
[1:06:52] uh
[1:06:53] god bless you brother johnny
[1:06:56] and let's uh
[1:07:06] i realized that we have not read the
[1:07:08] scripture yet
[1:07:10] and i've and i'm going like this praise
[1:07:12] the lord so for scripture reading let's
[1:07:15] get into our faith it's in john chapter
[1:07:17] five
[1:07:18] we'll come back again to the book of
[1:07:20] deuteronomy it's in john chapter five
[1:07:32] it's in john chapter 5 we stay
[1:07:37] lingering around the harmony
[1:07:39] of the father and the son this this uh
[1:07:41] this place we want to go
[1:07:43] this morning
[1:07:50] let's read from verse 19.
[1:07:52] on wednesday night we read from verse
[1:07:54] one and
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:08:04] we spoke a little bit of how the
[1:08:06] atonement has been idolized during the
[1:08:08] ages
[1:08:10] verse 19 then answered jesus
[1:08:13] and said unto them verily verily i say
[1:08:15] unto you the son can do nothing of
[1:08:18] himself
[1:08:19] but what he sees the father do
[1:08:22] what the father revealed to him see the
[1:08:25] father do for what things so ever he
[1:08:28] does
[1:08:29] this also do with the son likewise for
[1:08:33] the father loved the son and show it
[1:08:36] himself and show and show us him all
[1:08:38] things
[1:08:39] that himself does and he will show him
[1:08:44] greater work than this
[1:08:46] that ye my mother for as the father
[1:08:52] rises of the dead and quicken and
[1:08:55] quickeneth them
[1:08:56] even so the son
[1:08:58] quaking at home he will
[1:09:01] praise the lord
[1:09:03] for the father joshua no man
[1:09:07] but have committed
[1:09:09] all judgment
[1:09:11] unto
[1:09:12] the son
[1:09:14] let us pray
[1:09:15] father we want to thank you for the
[1:09:17] portion of your word that we have read
[1:09:20] and we we are fully fully trusting on
[1:09:23] you lord
[1:09:24] this morning
[1:09:25] that you will just come and take your
[1:09:27] word now father and
[1:09:29] and bless us in jesus name we pray
[1:09:32] amen amen the lord bless you you may
[1:09:35] have your seed we'll come back just in
[1:09:37] john chapter five that's what that was
[1:09:40] where our subject is from let's go back
[1:09:42] to the book of deuteronomy there was
[1:09:44] something there that caught my mind
[1:09:48] oh praise the lord
[1:09:50] amen
[1:09:53] moses
[1:09:54] year
[1:09:55] speak to the children of israel when the
[1:09:57] lord thy god shall bring thee into the
[1:09:59] land
[1:10:01] whether thy god will possess it and have
[1:10:04] cast out
[1:10:05] many nations before thee then he names
[1:10:08] the seven nations
[1:10:09] now the seven nations in in in the form
[1:10:12] of a type we can take there as the seven
[1:10:15] church agents praise the lord
[1:10:17] because uh god bringing out his bride
[1:10:20] from each of these church ages praise
[1:10:23] the lord and and these are the the
[1:10:25] nations uh whom
[1:10:27] uh uh israel was giving inheritance in
[1:10:31] the elaine
[1:10:32] praise the lord
[1:10:34] verse 2 and when the lord thy god shall
[1:10:36] deliver them before thee thou shalt
[1:10:39] smite them and utterly destroy them thou
[1:10:42] shalt make no covenant with them
[1:10:44] none show mercy unto them neither shall
[1:10:47] thou make
[1:10:48] marriages with them that daughter shall
[1:10:51] not go unto his sons and his daughters
[1:10:54] shall not take their sons
[1:10:56] for their will turn away their sons from
[1:11:00] following me
[1:11:01] that
[1:11:02] they may serve other gods so will the
[1:11:06] anger of the lord be countered against
[1:11:09] you
[1:11:10] and destroy
[1:11:12] the southern land praise the lord
[1:11:15] but they are
[1:11:17] but thus shall thou deed with them
[1:11:20] it shall destroy
[1:11:22] their altars and break down the images
[1:11:24] and cut down their gross and burn
[1:11:27] their gravy images with fire
[1:11:33] for thou art unholy people unto the lord
[1:11:38] the law thy god has chosen thee now this
[1:11:41] is the verse that caught my attention
[1:11:43] let's let's follow it closely there are
[1:11:46] holy people unto the lord the law that
[1:11:49] god has chosen thee to be a special
[1:11:52] people onto unto himself
[1:11:55] above all people that are upon the face
[1:11:58] of the earth
[1:12:00] can we say amen
[1:12:04] the lord did not set his love upon you
[1:12:08] not choose you
[1:12:11] because
[1:12:12] ye were more
[1:12:14] in number
[1:12:15] than any people
[1:12:18] for year where
[1:12:20] the feareth of all people
[1:12:25] but because
[1:12:27] the lord
[1:12:29] loves you
[1:12:32] praise the lord
[1:12:34] i go back again and read verse 6.
[1:12:41] for thou art unholy people
[1:12:44] unto the lord thy god
[1:12:47] now when god when moses was saying this
[1:12:50] to the people now you have to remember
[1:12:52] that this is uh the book of deuteronomy
[1:12:55] and is is is these are some of moses
[1:12:58] final words
[1:12:59] praise the lord
[1:13:02] these are some of his final words that
[1:13:04] he would say to the people
[1:13:06] knowing that uh
[1:13:08] uh
[1:13:09] for these very same people one time god
[1:13:11] wanted to destroy them and moses put
[1:13:13] himself in a gap
[1:13:15] and said lord you have to take me if you
[1:13:17] ever touch these people
[1:13:19] and then at another time
[1:13:21] moses got angry
[1:13:23] with the people and for these very same
[1:13:26] people god told him you're not going to
[1:13:28] see the land
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:31] now he's speaking to these people that
[1:13:32] have gave him trouble
[1:13:35] all
[1:13:35] through the wilderness
[1:13:37] these people
[1:13:39] that were murmuring these people
[1:13:42] they have all of the problems
[1:13:45] that make this man
[1:13:47] will not go into the promised land
[1:13:50] yeah he's speaking some of his last
[1:13:52] words to them
[1:13:54] and he's telling them
[1:13:56] for thou are unholy people
[1:13:59] unto the lord
[1:14:01] not a holiness
[1:14:03] that they have achieved
[1:14:06] but a holiness that was bestowed
[1:14:09] on them
[1:14:12] not a holiness because they did not have
[1:14:14] temper
[1:14:16] now the holiness because they were they
[1:14:18] have overcome lust
[1:14:20] not a holiness because they have they
[1:14:23] are they were now experiencing total
[1:14:25] deliverance and they had the baptism of
[1:14:28] the holy ghost with fire
[1:14:30] not because of that
[1:14:33] but now the prophet moses was now
[1:14:35] looking through the art of god
[1:14:38] and now he's now looking at god's people
[1:14:41] the way that god looked at his people
[1:14:48] praise the lord
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:52] oh may i find the out of god this
[1:14:54] morning
[1:14:55] to be able to look at you the way
[1:14:57] almighty god is looking at you
[1:14:59] praise the lord
[1:15:01] amen i need a kind of
[1:15:03] water to wash my face
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:07] i hope there was amazing yeah i could
[1:15:08] wash my face and see if i would be able
[1:15:11] to look at you the way almighty god is
[1:15:13] looking at you
[1:15:20] for there are unholy people unto the
[1:15:22] lord thy god the lord thy god
[1:15:26] have chosen them
[1:15:28] to be a special people
[1:15:31] unto him
[1:15:32] brother branham in the message
[1:15:35] one in a million
[1:15:38] he says just like in the natural life
[1:15:42] there were many cells from our father
[1:15:47] that were also
[1:15:50] good to live
[1:15:54] since there were millions of cells from
[1:15:56] our father millions of eggs from our
[1:15:59] mother
[1:16:00] they were all so good to live they had
[1:16:02] the same they had every potential that
[1:16:05] our cell had
[1:16:09] but
[1:16:11] for it to be us
[1:16:14] that would come alive and the rest of
[1:16:17] those cells would they would die it took
[1:16:20] almighty god to choose
[1:16:23] from the millions of cells
[1:16:26] that came from our father and the
[1:16:28] millions of exhales from our mother it
[1:16:30] took almighty god to choose which of
[1:16:34] those air cells will meet the blood
[1:16:36] cells
[1:16:40] to form you
[1:16:44] and in his choosing he will allow
[1:16:49] the rest of the million cells to die
[1:16:56] just because
[1:16:58] he did not want my mama to have millions
[1:17:00] of babies
[1:17:03] at once
[1:17:05] he only wanted me
[1:17:10] praise the lord
[1:17:14] and brother brahm said in in that
[1:17:16] choosing
[1:17:19] whether it was going to be a girl or a
[1:17:22] boy
[1:17:24] almighty god had to decide
[1:17:30] what is going to be the completion of
[1:17:33] the child
[1:17:35] almighty god has to do the choosing
[1:17:40] how many hair strain will come on the
[1:17:43] baby almighty god has to do the choosing
[1:17:50] he did all of those choosing for our
[1:17:53] natural
[1:17:54] ethnic life with his infinite wisdom
[1:18:04] praise the lord
[1:18:09] the prophet of god was saying that
[1:18:12] if god

[1:18:20] and we can
[1:18:22] stand today and say sir you know i am

[1:18:37] and thank god that you are alive
[1:18:41] and
[1:18:42] love yourself
[1:18:44] and that was all god's choosing
[1:18:48] for your effort
[1:18:51] life
[1:18:52] everybody how much more
[1:18:56] for your spiritual body

[1:19:40] just like i said uh moses using the art
[1:19:43] of god
[1:19:45] to to look at god's people
[1:19:48] that have created all the problems for
[1:19:50] him
[1:19:53] and
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:56] those people
[1:20:01] hearing moses saying this to them after
[1:20:05] moses will come back to tell them
[1:20:10] the lord our god will not allow me
[1:20:13] to go in the promised land
[1:20:17] but i'm telling you the lane is real
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:22] now you think about it now after
[1:20:25] the people will now realize
[1:20:28] that

[1:20:32] headache
[1:20:33] they ridiculed his wife
[1:20:36] they doubted him when he came
[1:20:41] the income against him and then uh cora
[1:20:44] and denton
[1:20:47] and all of that
[1:20:49] and to realize that they are sitting
[1:20:51] down and and and he's telling them
[1:20:55] the lord thy god
[1:20:58] you are a holy people the lord that god
[1:21:00] has choosing me
[1:21:01] for
[1:21:03] a special people

[1:21:20] people and holy people
[1:21:23] a special people
[1:21:25] now just as he's using the art of god
[1:21:30] to be able to look upon the people and
[1:21:32] speak to the people now the people need
[1:21:35] the heart of god
[1:21:37] to be able to receive
[1:21:39] what is spoken to them
[1:21:43] praise the lord
[1:21:47] because there's a spiritual war that is
[1:21:49] going there
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:52] moses by the grace of god a prophet of
[1:21:55] god has been lifted up in the spirit

[1:22:45] this guy myself we had it
[1:22:47] i gave him the peace of my mind
[1:22:52] praise the lord
[1:22:56] and you see the prophet could say all of
[1:22:58] this on the people
[1:23:00] and yet the people could come from that
[1:23:03] service
[1:23:06] feeling so defeated
[1:23:10] because they are they are they they are
[1:23:13] so battle in their mind
[1:23:15] that everything that moses is saying god
[1:23:18] has chosen you god has called you a holy
[1:23:22] people
[1:23:23] they have not been able to accept it
[1:23:29] there is nothing in them to be able to
[1:23:31] embrace that they are so identified with
[1:23:34] their failure their negative thinking
[1:23:39] that's right there is nothing in them to
[1:23:42] say amen moses
[1:23:52] praise the lord amen amen
[1:23:54] for thou our unholy people unto the lord
[1:23:56] of people

[1:24:16] oh how we could take that and call
[1:24:18] ourselves the super race
[1:24:22] praise the lord
[1:24:25] and we can call ourselves god's ego in
[1:24:27] every and every other denomination of
[1:24:29] verses of the devil
[1:24:34] and and and pride can get stuck under
[1:24:36] our wings
[1:24:40] that is a wings that can only flop and
[1:24:42] can never come down
[1:24:44] when pride gets stuck on it it just it
[1:24:46] just stay up like this
[1:24:53] now realizing that almighty god
[1:24:57] will look upon us like this

[1:25:52] when god set his love
[1:25:55] upon a martyr
[1:26:00] praise the lord amen

[1:26:04] for god so loved the word
[1:26:07] he loved the word because he made the
[1:26:09] word
[1:26:11] but yet in the word that he has made
[1:26:14] he has set his love
[1:26:20] upon a man
[1:26:23] upon a people
[1:26:28] the lord did not set his love upon you
[1:26:31] no choose you because you were more in
[1:26:33] numbers
[1:26:34] than any people
[1:26:36] for you were feared of all people
[1:26:40] but because the lord loves you
[1:26:44] and because he will keep the art

[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:53] that's the god that we had to deal with
[1:30:58] and all
[1:31:00] if it was a day where he would he would
[1:31:02] just speak
[1:31:03] audibly to us
[1:31:05] you know whether the preacher would just
[1:31:06] sit down and the voice of god would just
[1:31:08] speak
[1:31:11] praise the lord
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:17] but god
[1:31:19] in his uh
[1:31:20] his peculiar ways

[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:35] he said saying something and not saying
[1:31:38] it
[1:31:39] he said all of this year i've been
[1:31:40] trying to say something
[1:31:42] and not saying it and i i said to myself
[1:31:45] i said how is that all through the
[1:31:47] scripture

[1:32:18] but i believe that is a design that that
[1:32:22] that is a design of almighty god he
[1:32:26] designed it that way because
[1:32:29] there is a there there is an ability
[1:32:33] in
[1:32:35] every son and daughter of god like jesus
[1:32:38] said my sheep year in my voice

[1:32:49] up the deep thoughts of god
[1:32:52] to be able to pick up those things that
[1:32:54] he's speaking to us directly
[1:32:58] yeah even if i try to say it clearly i
[1:33:01] will never be able to say like the way

[1:33:29] us this far is able to take us in
[1:33:32] and i can tell you since we are more
[1:33:34] closer than the miles that we have come

[1:34:33] we can be called sons and daughters of
[1:34:35] god
[1:34:38] and uh
[1:34:41] and john
[1:34:43] said all of those things
[1:34:45] you know like brother brahma says after
[1:34:46] he came you know out of
[1:34:50] the island of patmos after after he have
[1:34:52] experienced
[1:34:54] you know uh
[1:34:56] what what we are experiencing now
[1:34:59] you know he was he was he was shown
[1:35:01] things by the angel
[1:35:03] you know the deep things of god he was
[1:35:06] shown things concerning the ages and all
[1:35:09] of that
[1:35:10] and and then he came out of that
[1:35:13] and he make this statement
[1:35:15] and he says
[1:35:18] he that have the sin of the seed of god
[1:35:21] do not commit sin
[1:35:25] it's a kind of a strong statement that
[1:35:28] our
[1:35:29] our
[1:35:32] human mind struggle with
[1:35:35] amen
[1:35:39] and uh
[1:35:42] i said as i think on that
[1:35:46] trying to read a little bit on on uh
[1:35:50] that's uh first john chapter three
[1:36:03] first run chapter 3.
[1:36:15] president chapter 3 verse 7 little
[1:36:18] children let no man deceive you
[1:36:22] he that does righteousness is righteous
[1:36:25] even as
[1:36:27] he is righteous
[1:36:29] he that committed sin
[1:36:32] is of the devil
[1:36:34] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:36:37] for this purpose the son of god is
[1:36:40] manifested
[1:36:42] that he might destroy
[1:36:44] the works
[1:36:46] of the devil
[1:36:48] praise the lord
[1:36:52] whosoever is born of god
[1:36:54] does not commit sin
[1:36:57] for his seed god's seed remedies in him
[1:37:02] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:37:06] god
[1:37:08] praise the lord
[1:37:11] now
[1:37:15] if you look at this again
[1:37:17] our mind can go into all of our wrongs
[1:37:22] but we we have there with this with this
[1:37:24] before
[1:37:25] we just drop right in here
[1:37:28] to be able to realize the other uh
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:45] okay let's let's go up a little bit
[1:37:48] let's let's just go off a little bit i
[1:37:50] just want to bring this in so so we can
[1:37:53] we can uh
[1:37:59] verse five and you know that he was
[1:38:02] manifested
[1:38:04] to take away
[1:38:05] our sins
[1:38:08] and in him is no
[1:38:12] sin
[1:38:16] the lord
[1:38:17] so when john these year
[1:38:20] with the subject of saints and sin
[1:38:24] we know that
[1:38:26] every time he talks about sin without
[1:38:28] the s he goes back to the beginning
[1:38:34] which is unbelief
[1:38:38] praise the lord
[1:38:40] so he that is born of god
[1:38:44] will not disbelieve god's word
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:48] even if he's not living up to it he will
[1:38:51] say amen to the world
[1:38:58] praise the lord
[1:39:02] are we together
[1:39:11] so
[1:39:12] we will
[1:39:16] we just trust a lot we stay in there and
[1:39:18] just keep going and keep going but let's
[1:39:20] come back to our subject the gamers
[1:39:22] church age brother branham says now
[1:39:25] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:39:27] son
[1:39:28] jesus never did anything until
[1:39:32] it was first shown him by the father
[1:39:35] first john 5 19 that was what we read
[1:39:38] this harmony
[1:39:40] is known to exist between the groom and
[1:39:43] the brine
[1:39:46] he shows her his word
[1:39:50] of life
[1:39:51] she receive it
[1:39:54] praise the lord
[1:39:56] amen
[1:39:57] she receive it
[1:40:02] and then they produce itself she never
[1:40:04] does it
[1:40:06] therefore nothing can harm her
[1:40:09] not even death
[1:40:12] praise the lord
[1:40:14] why because she received
[1:40:18] the word of
[1:40:20] promise praise the lord
[1:40:23] now we read there over in uh uh uh
[1:40:29] saint john
[1:40:30] chapter 5
[1:40:32] jesus making this very same statement
[1:40:35] and then he goes on
[1:40:38] and he made a statement here
[1:40:40] that the the father george had no man
[1:40:45] but has committed
[1:40:47] all judgment
[1:40:49] on to the son
[1:40:52] why because it's the harmony that is
[1:40:54] between the father and the son the
[1:40:56] father has a work he did a portion of
[1:41:00] work and the son also
[1:41:03] go back to genesis god
[1:41:05] said let there be he created separated
[1:41:08] the water from the land and he was able
[1:41:11] to have a son
[1:41:13] in his image
[1:41:17] praise the lord
[1:41:19] and now that son
[1:41:22] was the one man that named the animals
[1:41:27] name the plants
[1:41:29] so you see the harmony of the father and
[1:41:33] the son has been right from the
[1:41:35] beginning
[1:41:38] are we together
[1:41:43] first king chapter two
[1:42:06] um
[1:42:21] praise the lord
[1:42:23] sometimes we get
[1:42:26] a so
[1:42:29] in the place where the you know we
[1:42:31] we expect every service to be
[1:42:34] fire and brimstones
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:39] praise the lord
[1:42:41] and people that comes out of fire and
[1:42:42] brainstorms if it is not fired and
[1:42:44] brainstormed the service was not great
[1:42:47] praise the lord every saturday we got to
[1:42:49] break the building down
[1:42:51] and then we rebuilt it for the next
[1:42:52] service
[1:42:54] the greatness of god is not seen in
[1:42:55] destruction
[1:42:58] amen
[1:42:59] it's not it's not only seen in
[1:43:00] destruction
[1:43:02] praise the lord
[1:43:03] hallelujah
[1:43:06] so if you if you came with your hammer
[1:43:08] to break down this morning
[1:43:11] praise the lord amen
[1:43:15] now
[1:43:17] first king chapter 2
[1:43:19] now the days of david drew 9 that he
[1:43:22] should die and he tries solomon his son
[1:43:26] saying i go the way
[1:43:28] of all the earth
[1:43:30] be thou strong therefore and show that
[1:43:33] self a man
[1:43:35] and
[1:43:36] and keep the charge of the lord thy god
[1:43:39] to walk in his ways
[1:43:42] to keep his stature and his combining
[1:43:46] and
[1:43:49] his judgment
[1:43:52] his testimony
[1:43:54] as it is written in the lord of moses
[1:43:56] that thou may have prospered in all that
[1:43:59] the others and whatever so ever
[1:44:02] thou turned ourself
[1:44:05] that the lord may continue
[1:44:08] his word which he speaks concerning
[1:44:10] means saying if that children take heed
[1:44:14] to
[1:44:15] their ways to walk before men in truth
[1:44:18] with all their heart and with all the
[1:44:21] assault there shall not fail
[1:44:24] thee
[1:44:25] say he a man
[1:44:27] on the throne of israel
[1:44:31] but you will you will realize
[1:44:34] that
[1:44:35] this was broken
[1:44:37] if you study the kings
[1:44:41] because there was a seed of david
[1:44:46] that the lord told they would destroy
[1:44:48] him in all his sons
[1:44:52] praise the lord
[1:44:57] do you believe that you want us to do a
[1:44:59] little bible studies
[1:45:01] amen
[1:45:03] you see so yeri said god moses i mean
[1:45:06] david is re-echoing
[1:45:09] he's re-echoing the covenant that god
[1:45:11] gave him
[1:45:12] to his son harmony between the father
[1:45:14] and the son amen and and says this is
[1:45:18] the word of the lord the lord told me if
[1:45:21] my sons my sons will walk in the statute
[1:45:24] of the lord keep his commandment they
[1:45:26] will not fail to be a
[1:45:28] seed of david on the throne
[1:45:34] praise the lord
[1:45:36] amen
[1:45:37] oh i love this
[1:45:40] hallelujah
[1:45:42] i love this
[1:45:44] because that's those are some of the
[1:45:46] things that put me in my elements
[1:45:49] glory be to god
[1:45:52] but then we realize
[1:45:56] when you come to
[1:45:59] to study you will realize the other
[1:46:06] let me just do a little a little search
[1:46:08] here
[1:46:09] i wrote that yet i was
[1:46:11] making some notes
[1:46:15] now you see word
[1:46:18] that's the reason why
[1:46:20] the promise of the virgin shall conceive
[1:46:28] praise the lord
[1:46:30] that was the reason why god gave
[1:46:34] israel
[1:46:36] that promise
[1:46:39] is there anything too high for the lord
[1:46:43] it says the virgin a virgin shall
[1:46:46] conceive
[1:46:48] i will give you a sign
[1:46:51] why because now it would take
[1:46:55] a virgin birth
[1:46:57] to be able to fulfill the promise that
[1:47:00] god gave to david
[1:47:08] because a seed of david
[1:47:10] disobeyed god
[1:47:12] and he and all his sons wesley
[1:47:18] praise the lord he found that in uh in
[1:47:21] the life of jacob knight
[1:47:24] he and all his sons were asleep
[1:47:29] so that that would have ended the
[1:47:31] natural sea of david
[1:47:34] on the throne
[1:47:40] the only way that he or david would come
[1:47:42] back on the throne it has to be by a
[1:47:46] birth that is not by man's hands
[1:47:55] praise the lord
[1:47:59] amen
[1:48:02] so you will see that's the reason why
[1:48:04] over in the in in in the book of luke
[1:48:08] there is two genealogy between matthew
[1:48:10] and luke
[1:48:13] luke brought
[1:48:16] christ into
[1:48:20] david lynch
[1:48:22] true mary
[1:48:27] why because
[1:48:28] he was the sea of the woman
[1:48:36] back to genesis 3 15
[1:48:44] are we together
[1:48:47] now so
[1:48:48] i've i've i kind of frustrated from
[1:48:50] there but uh
[1:48:51] uh uh
[1:48:53] it just it just kind of hit my mind here
[1:49:00] and david's speaking to to solomon in
[1:49:02] this white and the lord may continue his
[1:49:05] word which he speaks concerning me
[1:49:07] saying if that children take heed to
[1:49:08] their ways to walk before meaning truth
[1:49:11] with all their hearts
[1:49:13] and with all the assault there shall not
[1:49:16] fail thee
[1:49:17] he set a man on
[1:49:21] on the throne of israel
[1:49:24] praise the lord
[1:49:26] moreover than
[1:49:28] their knoweth also
[1:49:31] what job the sun
[1:49:33] now so what is what what we are going
[1:49:36] into and what is happening here is that
[1:49:39] david is in his final days
[1:49:44] these are the
[1:49:45] last words of david to his son
[1:49:49] solomon
[1:49:52] but now david
[1:49:54] just like jesus said
[1:49:56] the father judges no man
[1:49:59] but has committed all judgment on to the
[1:50:02] son
[1:50:04] david now is going to rehearse to
[1:50:06] solomon
[1:50:09] the man that did him evil
[1:50:17] praise the lord
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:22] he's going to rehearse to solomon
[1:50:25] remember job
[1:50:27] remember this one i spit in my face
[1:50:30] remember this other one
[1:50:34] what is happening there the father
[1:50:36] committing all judgment
[1:50:38] unto the son
[1:50:45] praise the lord
[1:50:47] when that when when when that benji my
[1:50:50] spirit in david's face one of his men
[1:50:53] took out a sword you dog spit on my
[1:50:55] master david said leave him
[1:50:59] david said leave him
[1:51:02] jesus said you call the son of man that
[1:51:05] baseball it will be forgiving you
[1:51:10] but one word spoken against the holy
[1:51:11] ghost
[1:51:12] will not be forgiving you in this word
[1:51:16] or in the word to come
[1:51:20] so it put the church
[1:51:22] in the same harmony between the father
[1:51:24] and the son
[1:51:28] so the church is is taking a special
[1:51:31] place
[1:51:33] a place of mercy
[1:51:36] and a place of judgment
[1:51:41] got one word
[1:51:46] praise the lord
[1:51:50] he met paul on the road of damascus and
[1:51:52] said so so why persecute thou me
[1:51:57] praise the lord
[1:52:00] so i never met him in his ethnic
[1:52:01] ministry never met him in his earthly
[1:52:03] life
[1:52:07] but because he was haunting the church
[1:52:09] of the living gods down
[1:52:16] praise the lord
[1:52:22] because he was haunting the church he
[1:52:23] was persecuting the church
[1:52:25] he was ridiculing the church
[1:52:28] and everything that he was saying
[1:52:29] against the church
[1:52:32] it was against christ
[1:52:38] last week we read
[1:52:40] spoken word is original see life comes
[1:52:42] through the body
[1:52:46] amen
[1:52:48] god church might be
[1:52:50] a few group of people
[1:52:54] they might not have the wealth of this
[1:52:56] world it can be on a a little tent or on
[1:53:00] a scoffer building
[1:53:05] but as long as they are named after the
[1:53:07] name of the lord
[1:53:09] god is identified with them amen
[1:53:14] praise the lord
[1:53:19] if we don't think that's the place we
[1:53:20] want to be because we want to be in a
[1:53:22] building like this with air conditioning
[1:53:24] and you know then find one
[1:53:28] leave that leave that small rugged group
[1:53:31] of people
[1:53:32] whether they're sitting on on the ground
[1:53:35] praise the lord
[1:53:36] are they sitting on benches whatever
[1:53:38] condition they are in
[1:53:48] understanding the position of the local
[1:53:50] church
[1:53:54] the same relationship
[1:53:57] and harmony
[1:53:58] that was between the father and the son
[1:54:03] the prophet said it should exist between
[1:54:05] the bride and it's existing
[1:54:08] between
[1:54:10] christ and his bride
[1:54:14] praise the lord
[1:54:16] so you go back you can read the entire
[1:54:18] scripture then and use your concordance
[1:54:20] and go back and search and see
[1:54:22] all of those cases because when david
[1:54:25] when david mentioned job here there were
[1:54:27] three things he mentioned joe above he
[1:54:29] went back to abner abner was the captain
[1:54:33] of saw army
[1:54:37] praise the lord
[1:54:38] amen he was the captain of saul i mean
[1:54:41] now you would think you would think now
[1:54:43] let look look at it this way joe up is
[1:54:45] the man that has stood with david he's
[1:54:47] he's the captain of the group praise the
[1:54:50] lord
[1:54:51] amen and our soul is dead
[1:54:54] as long as
[1:54:56] abner and his men he keeps his men
[1:54:58] together he will always
[1:55:01] found an attack against uh
[1:55:03] job or against david
[1:55:05] so job in his mind
[1:55:08] thinking that if i can get rid of the
[1:55:10] captain i can i can
[1:55:13] dismember the ban
[1:55:16] amen
[1:55:16] they don't have a head over them anymore
[1:55:18] they were either surrounded they would
[1:55:20] run away or they were surrounded
[1:55:24] praise the lord
[1:55:26] in david's mind
[1:55:28] thou was a seed of israel
[1:55:31] he was a captain of the army of israel
[1:55:39] praise the lord
[1:55:42] amen
[1:55:43] take another example again
[1:55:47] because sometimes
[1:55:52] we it's easy for us to get ourselves to
[1:55:54] the place and and you know get in our
[1:55:57] own channel of understanding and then
[1:55:59] justify everything we are doing
[1:56:05] take take another example here
[1:56:08] take this this next man that that
[1:56:11] david mentioned
[1:56:13] for which reason he's selling solomon
[1:56:15] you you you will take care of job i know
[1:56:17] you will take care of him
[1:56:19] praise the lord out that and the next
[1:56:21] man there is there uh
[1:56:35] and what he did to the two captains
[1:56:38] of the host of israel now that's that's
[1:56:41] the underlying phrase
[1:56:45] that's the underlying phrase no matter
[1:56:48] what church they were in
[1:56:52] what camp they were in
[1:56:54] these were seas of israel
[1:57:01] praise the lord
[1:57:04] and the next guide uh uh
[1:57:06] amasha he's uh he's he was the captain
[1:57:11] of the army
[1:57:12] when absalom
[1:57:15] kicked his father from the throne
[1:57:18] now so think about it now
[1:57:21] himalaya why why should why should david
[1:57:24] grief over there
[1:57:26] in a human sense
[1:57:28] you will understand that job was trying
[1:57:30] to protect him
[1:57:32] because these were the people that were
[1:57:34] rebelling
[1:57:40] but that's what we will realize that
[1:57:42] some of the things that we we hold to
[1:57:45] you know that's my standing you will
[1:57:46] realize that when you get
[1:57:50] to the river
[1:57:52] you were not needed to cross
[1:57:58] you were not needed to cross
[1:58:06] praise the lord
[1:58:11] but you would need someone
[1:58:13] to cross you
[1:58:19] naturally you would think
[1:58:22] you go back and read the story this this
[1:58:24] man i mean i i mean uh uh abner he was
[1:58:28] was saw they were haunting david down
[1:58:34] but you see just like the same position
[1:58:36] that moses talked
[1:58:38] when he came to the last hours of his
[1:58:40] days
[1:58:41] the very same people he rebelled he
[1:58:44] called rebel now he's telling me you are
[1:58:46] holy people
[1:58:56] verb said i've seen many people crossing
[1:58:59] this life
[1:59:01] he said i have seen many on their
[1:59:03] deathbed
[1:59:04] before the cross and go to the region of
[1:59:06] the lust
[1:59:07] and i have also seen many
[1:59:10] before the cross and go to the region of
[1:59:12] the blessing
[1:59:14] praise the lord
[1:59:16] he says many when they get to that place
[1:59:19] they can feel the influence
[1:59:23] of the other word
[1:59:26] praise the lord
[1:59:28] and i believe in my heart as moses as
[1:59:30] david get closer
[1:59:32] this was his last word and you read down
[1:59:35] the bible says and he was gathered with
[1:59:36] his father
[1:59:38] verse 10 so david slept with his father
[1:59:41] and was buried in the city after he has
[1:59:43] said these things
[1:59:48] so it means that when he when he got to
[1:59:50] that place in his life he was now on
[1:59:54] another
[1:59:55] influence
[1:59:59] praise the lord
[2:00:01] where he could see and understand things
[2:00:04] better
[2:00:07] sometimes we think we understand it we
[2:00:09] get it we calculate it and we get
[2:00:10] everything together
[2:00:12] and sometimes those calculation and
[2:00:14] conclusion we come to impressing our
[2:00:17] spirit
[2:00:18] that we cannot go any further we cannot
[2:00:21] make room we cannot make accommodation
[2:00:23] for nothing else because we have
[2:00:25] established in ourself
[2:00:27] that i believe this is the truth
[2:00:31] praise the lord you even see some people
[2:00:33] god will dedicate me
[2:00:35] god only vindicate his word
[2:00:38] god do not benefit a mortar
[2:00:41] he vindicate his word
[2:00:54] praise the lord
[2:00:59] hallelujah
[2:01:05] these two
[2:01:06] captives of israel
[2:01:08] whom he slayed
[2:01:10] and and sheared the blood of war in
[2:01:12] peace
[2:01:13] and put the blood of war upon the gather
[2:01:17] that was about his limbs and and
[2:01:20] and
[2:01:22] in his shoes that was on his feet dude
[2:01:25] therefore a calling to thy wisdom
[2:01:27] committing judgment do a calling to that
[2:01:31] wisdom
[2:01:32] david was not expressing
[2:01:35] his anger
[2:01:37] he was committing
[2:01:40] to the son
[2:01:43] praise the lord
[2:01:45] i hate that man he was not expressing
[2:01:47] his anger
[2:01:50] he says do according to your wisdom he
[2:01:53] was committing to the son
[2:01:57] praise the lord
[2:02:02] and let none
[2:02:05] of his hair hair go down to the grave in
[2:02:08] peace
[2:02:10] but show kindness
[2:02:14] to the sons of
[2:02:16] brazilian the gate line and and let them
[2:02:20] be
[2:02:21] of those that eat at that table
[2:02:25] he's he's running judgment on this side
[2:02:28] he's also giving mercy
[2:02:30] on the side the father committing all
[2:02:33] judgment
[2:02:34] unto the son
[2:02:39] praise the lord
[2:02:40] amen
[2:02:42] now you see uh uh
[2:02:50] and as the prophet of god said that's
[2:02:51] that's uh that's that is the
[2:02:53] relationship
[2:02:54] that is existing
[2:02:57] between christ and his bride
[2:03:00] amen
[2:03:03] because he paid the price
[2:03:07] he came and he gave his life
[2:03:10] but yet
[2:03:11] there is a little portion of redemption
[2:03:13] and redemption work that needs to be
[2:03:15] done
[2:03:16] and the bride is here to be able to
[2:03:18] carry it carry that out but you see
[2:03:20] she's in power
[2:03:23] she's not just standing on her own word
[2:03:26] or on her own merit and trying to do
[2:03:28] things but no she's in power
[2:03:32] she has an authority that is backing her
[2:03:34] up
[2:03:42] praise the lord
[2:03:51] the exposition
[2:03:55] of the seventh church age and there they
[2:03:57] hear him
[2:03:59] will be blessed and become part of that
[2:04:02] bride
[2:04:04] of the last day who are mentioned in
[2:04:06] revelation 22 17.
[2:04:09] the spirit and the bride says come
[2:04:14] the corn of wheat
[2:04:16] the bright wheat
[2:04:18] that fell into the ground at nissan
[2:04:20] council has come back to original word
[2:04:24] green again
[2:04:27] praise god forever
[2:04:29] amen yes listening to the
[2:04:33] authenticity prophet of
[2:04:35] god who appear in the last day
[2:04:39] what he say from god the bride will say
[2:04:43] the bride the prophet the spirit the
[2:04:46] bride
[2:04:47] and the prophet
[2:04:48] let me say it right the spirit the
[2:04:51] prophet and the bride
[2:04:53] will be saying the same thing
[2:04:56] amen
[2:04:58] praise the lord
[2:04:59] because that is the harmony
[2:05:04] praise the lord that is the harmony
[2:05:08] that is between
[2:05:09] christ and his bride
[2:05:14] praise the lord
[2:05:15] just as he was the word
[2:05:18] she knows that she's an expression of
[2:05:22] the word
[2:05:25] he was the express image
[2:05:28] like paul says in hebrew one
[2:05:31] she's an expression of the word the
[2:05:34] spirit the prophet and the bride will be
[2:05:37] saying the same thing
[2:05:40] and what
[2:05:41] they will say
[2:05:43] will have already been said in
[2:05:47] the world
[2:05:50] praise the lord
[2:05:51] that's the reason why jesus is saying
[2:05:54] the father joshua no man but has
[2:05:56] committed all judgment on to the son and
[2:05:59] we can go back
[2:06:01] in kings and see a type of david doing
[2:06:04] the same because it's already in the
[2:06:06] world
[2:06:11] praise the lord
[2:06:14] we can go back
[2:06:16] and and see that god has already played
[2:06:19] out in the word before jesus came and
[2:06:21] said
[2:06:22] the father joshua no man
[2:06:25] but has committed all judgment to the
[2:06:27] son
[2:06:30] amen
[2:06:31] so you see brother i'm saying the spirit
[2:06:33] the prophet and the bride will say the
[2:06:36] same thing and what they will be saying
[2:06:38] has already been said in the word
[2:06:50] praise the lord
[2:06:58] they are saying it now come out of
[2:07:01] come out from amon heard now
[2:07:03] and be separated the cry has gone out
[2:07:07] the cry is going out
[2:07:10] praise the lord
[2:07:12] how long
[2:07:13] will the voice cry we do not know but
[2:07:16] one thing
[2:07:17] we do know
[2:07:19] it won't be long
[2:07:21] for this is the last age
[2:07:24] praise the lord
[2:07:26] amen
[2:07:29] that's the harmony
[2:07:31] that exists between the father and the
[2:07:32] son
[2:07:33] that that that that protection is there
[2:07:36] because god honor his word
[2:07:39] god is obligated to his word god will
[2:07:42] vindicate his word
[2:07:44] so when we stay with the word
[2:07:46] still with the message of the hour
[2:07:49] amen
[2:07:51] god comes behind that and back it
[2:07:56] praise the lord
[2:07:57] now not in a place of word you know
[2:08:00] where we we we try to to run the church
[2:08:03] like a boss count
[2:08:06] and says well let the deacon stand back
[2:08:07] there you stand back there uh uh uh
[2:08:10] brother ben and brother danny see those
[2:08:13] brothers when they're coming look at
[2:08:14] their haircut
[2:08:17] you know put them aside let them go and
[2:08:19] get a haircut they say look at the
[2:08:21] sisters and you are running the church
[2:08:23] like a boy scout
[2:08:26] it's not in the word
[2:08:30] amen
[2:08:30] amen
[2:08:34] praise the lord
[2:08:41] we must create an atmosphere where the
[2:08:43] holy ghost can deal with the people
[2:08:47] where the word can come out of the pages
[2:08:50] and bring conviction to the human heart
[2:08:55] oh is it wrong to tell a brother to call
[2:08:57] his head no it's not wrong
[2:09:00] it's not wrong
[2:09:02] but yet the prophet of god said you
[2:09:03] don't make converts
[2:09:05] by government
[2:09:07] christ is the mystery of god reveal you
[2:09:09] don't make converts by government
[2:09:19] it's all of those those those little
[2:09:21] human effort
[2:09:24] that we try to run god's church by
[2:09:32] let's start with the word amen
[2:09:43] in every age
[2:09:45] we have exactly the same pattern
[2:09:51] the same that church age that is why the
[2:09:54] light comes through
[2:09:57] some god-given messenger in a setting
[2:09:59] age
[2:10:00] and then from the messenger
[2:10:03] they spread the light through the
[2:10:06] ministry
[2:10:07] of others
[2:10:09] praise the lord
[2:10:11] who have been faithfully taught
[2:10:19] amen who has been faithfully taught
[2:10:32] praise the lord amen
[2:10:38] it took 10 years
[2:10:40] for elijah to fit into elijah mentor
[2:10:53] that is why the lie comes through some
[2:10:55] god gave a messenger to a set in a
[2:10:58] certain area
[2:10:59] and then from that messenger they spread
[2:11:01] the light through the ministry of others
[2:11:04] who have been faithfully taught
[2:11:06] but of course all those who go out don't
[2:11:10] always learn how necessary
[2:11:13] it is to speak only what the messenger
[2:11:17] has spoken
[2:11:20] praise the lord i'll tell you if you are
[2:11:22] running with just a one-line call it's
[2:11:25] not all that the messenger have said
[2:11:35] because we have a lot of one-liners
[2:11:47] they idea and they take away years
[2:11:51] and soon the message is no longer appeal
[2:11:56] and the revival
[2:11:57] dies
[2:12:02] praise the lord amen
[2:12:04] because
[2:12:06] the message is not to to reproduce
[2:12:09] pentecost
[2:12:12] praise the lord but the message has the
[2:12:15] pentecostal blessing
[2:12:17] amen amen
[2:12:19] yeah it has the pentecostal blessing it
[2:12:21] has the pentecost holy girl she has the
[2:12:24] pentecost gifts all of those things must
[2:12:27] be there
[2:12:28] but it's not to reproduce pentecost
[2:12:31] no
[2:12:44] the idea to take that and soon the
[2:12:47] message is no longer pure and the
[2:12:49] revival dies down
[2:12:52] how careful we must be
[2:12:55] to hear one voice
[2:12:57] for the spirit has but one voice
[2:13:01] which is the voice of god
[2:13:05] praise the lord
[2:13:10] hallelujah
[2:13:15] since
[2:13:17] this message is to put a bride in the
[2:13:19] rapture
[2:13:21] amen
[2:13:26] is to get a people ready
[2:13:28] for the rapture
[2:13:33] hallelujah
[2:13:36] i was talking with a
[2:13:38] dear brother and myself well
[2:13:40] fellowshipping here yesterday
[2:13:42] we had some few things to talk about and
[2:13:44] then we started talking
[2:13:46] on some other things
[2:13:49] and then we got down to to the subject
[2:13:51] broadband mentioned here he says one
[2:13:53] some of the greatest men
[2:13:56] of all ages a charles paul james
[2:14:00] he mentioned smith wiggle wolfing
[2:14:02] mentioned all of those men
[2:14:05] there was something we were talking and
[2:14:06] we got down to that and i told the
[2:14:08] brother that says i have
[2:14:10] always
[2:14:12] marvel at that statement
[2:14:16] i said because if you realize all of
[2:14:18] those men
[2:14:20] that brother brown mentioned as the
[2:14:22] greatest man
[2:14:24] they were all men that came under the
[2:14:26] men's anointing
[2:14:32] they were all men that were just honored
[2:14:35] they are the age of the man's anointing
[2:14:39] praise the lord
[2:14:42] and those were some of the men that were
[2:14:45] that wrote some of the greatest
[2:14:47] christian literature you can ever find
[2:14:50] i said the thing in there that that
[2:14:53] we matter mean is just to see how
[2:14:57] you know you you look at uh honor the
[2:15:00] the lion anointing uh uh uh that was
[2:15:03] when uh brother branham said great
[2:15:06] evangelistical work was done
[2:15:08] those disciples they saw everything that
[2:15:10] they had
[2:15:12] and they were ready to to spread the
[2:15:14] message
[2:15:16] the prophet said that was the reason why
[2:15:18] the holy ghost led him to bring in all
[2:15:20] the their belongings and lay them at
[2:15:22] their apostle feet because god was about
[2:15:25] to take them out scatter them
[2:15:30] praise the lord
[2:15:32] people like andrews and and and all of
[2:15:35] these men
[2:15:37] they will get on the boat ignoring
[2:15:39] nobody where they are going to jump on
[2:15:41] the boat
[2:15:43] and all their glory in their heart they
[2:15:46] want to testify of a raising christ
[2:15:50] they are not going on invitation
[2:15:54] they are going because the boat has an
[2:15:57] address that is going to
[2:16:00] if this boat is traveling to this place
[2:16:03] i'm going with it i will meet people
[2:16:04] there
[2:16:08] praise the lord the first three ages
[2:16:10] came honor their their that anointing
[2:16:16] praise the lord
[2:16:19] and then right after that time
[2:16:22] the church got on the the dark age
[2:16:25] persecution break out
[2:16:28] praise the lord
[2:16:29] and the church was now under the ox
[2:16:32] anointing
[2:16:34] you find people like we said i mean a
[2:16:38] young old people the love of god was so
[2:16:41] much in their heart
[2:16:42] that they were ready to be burned to the
[2:16:44] stake
[2:16:46] they were they were ready for a sword to
[2:16:49] go through their body
[2:16:51] such an anointing upon them they were
[2:16:53] just responding to the anointing of the
[2:16:55] hour
[2:16:57] praise the lord
[2:16:59] in the fourth seed brother braham says
[2:17:00] the church can do nothing
[2:17:02] but respond to heart anointing
[2:17:09] glory be to god
[2:17:12] now yes the age also
[2:17:15] this man
[2:17:17] god
[2:17:19] blessed him
[2:17:21] god
[2:17:22] opened
[2:17:25] a channel of inspiration
[2:17:33] read the book of john g lakes
[2:17:37] i was just telling the brother
[2:17:39] years back there was around 1993-94
[2:17:45] that was the first time i came across
[2:17:49] uh
[2:17:50] ian bounds book power true prey
[2:17:54] i took it from a library of a baptist
[2:17:58] missionary
[2:18:00] praise the lord
[2:18:01] and like i told the brother yesterday i
[2:18:03] said i almost told that book
[2:18:08] praise the lord
[2:18:10] i mean that book has such
[2:18:13] such an impression on me
[2:18:19] ian bounds talks about uh uh uh you know
[2:18:22] uh john wesley prayer life
[2:18:25] man that will spend six hours in praying
[2:18:31] and he talks about all of these men and
[2:18:33] and and you know the time they spend
[2:18:35] before god and why they they are their
[2:18:37] 10-minute message and 15-minute message
[2:18:40] was so powerful because they spent more
[2:18:42] time before god than the time they were
[2:18:44] spent before man
[2:18:47] praise the lord amen but you see i i i
[2:18:50] mean i i mean i read the book and i read
[2:18:53] it again and i read it again and you
[2:18:56] know i i tried to memorize my head is
[2:18:58] not good in keeping things
[2:19:02] praise the lord
[2:19:03] i took notebook and i wrote in and you
[2:19:05] know and and i would just read it and
[2:19:07] read it and you know and then you know
[2:19:09] what i i get down there to pray then and
[2:19:12] i pray then you know and you go there
[2:19:14] two three hours oh lord like you know i
[2:19:16] need to go six hours
[2:19:20] eight hours
[2:19:22] man you read us kind of a book you just
[2:19:24] feel ashamed of yourself
[2:19:26] you read the fastest books of mata yo
[2:19:29] and see whether those people give you a
[2:19:30] lot you feel so ashamed what am i doing
[2:19:32] for god
[2:19:34] [Music]
[2:19:36] they responded to their anointing
[2:19:39] you have to find your anointing for your
[2:19:41] hour
[2:19:43] to respond to him
[2:19:47] and that was how the lord delivered me
[2:19:52] praise the lord
[2:19:54] that was how he delivered me
[2:19:58] it's because
[2:19:59] i'm reading of men of this gospel that
[2:20:03] will honor their anointing for their
[2:20:05] hour
[2:20:06] praise the lord and the anointing was
[2:20:09] raising them up in prayer and inspiring
[2:20:12] them to write books and and i mean these
[2:20:14] guys right things you you read
[2:20:16] my goodness
[2:20:22] praise the lord
[2:20:26] even even in charles lincoln
[2:20:31] praise the lord
[2:20:32] yeah he was he was from he's from that
[2:20:34] era
[2:20:38] he's from that era
[2:20:47] that's the man that uh you know the
[2:20:49] brother brandon is accused of
[2:20:51] plagiarizing
[2:20:55] he's from that era
[2:20:57] and i can show you i'm working on
[2:20:59] something i'll show you with him
[2:21:01] at the appointed time
[2:21:03] praise the lord
[2:21:06] because
[2:21:08] the ministry
[2:21:13] of the seven angel
[2:21:15] was to gather the loose ends
[2:21:18] praise the lord
[2:21:20] amen
[2:21:21] was to gather the loose ends and what is
[2:21:23] that to bring balance
[2:21:27] to godly teachings
[2:21:29] to man the high truth
[2:21:32] but never have balance
[2:21:38] to bring strictural balance
[2:21:44] that's the reason why those opening of
[2:21:46] the seals was one of the greatest time
[2:21:48] brother brands is the greatest time in
[2:21:49] my ministry
[2:21:52] he says because if it was not the help
[2:21:54] of the angel of the lord every night i
[2:21:56] would have come out with a wrong
[2:21:58] interpretation of those seals
[2:22:02] but every night god will send an angel
[2:22:05] and says this white house rather is not
[2:22:08] the holy ghost
[2:22:10] this is the antichrist
[2:22:12] why because he has a bald he do not have
[2:22:14] an arrow
[2:22:29] praise the lord
[2:22:31] you see the harmony that was existing
[2:22:32] between the son and the father it was
[2:22:35] not only on
[2:22:37] acne relationship or on friendship or no
[2:22:40] no no it was a harmony that was based on
[2:22:42] the word
[2:22:50] it was a harmony that was based on the
[2:22:53] word
[2:23:02] of the sons of of david
[2:23:06] absalom was the preferred son
[2:23:09] the bible said he was loved by the
[2:23:10] people
[2:23:12] and i also believe that david love him
[2:23:16] because he was his son
[2:23:19] praise the lord
[2:23:21] but you see god's choosing
[2:23:24] was the son that came from the
[2:23:26] adulterous woman
[2:23:30] and god sent his prophet mitten to david
[2:23:32] to instruct david
[2:23:35] and absalom will take the throne
[2:23:39] praise the lord
[2:23:41] so even if david never had that
[2:23:44] affection
[2:23:46] that he had for solomon for for uh that
[2:23:48] he had for absalom if he never had the
[2:23:51] same affection for solomon now god has
[2:23:53] spoken
[2:23:58] god has spoken what am i saying there
[2:24:00] because the homily is not based on our
[2:24:03] human effort
[2:24:07] amen the way that god is dealing with us
[2:24:10] in this age is because god has spoken
[2:24:13] his word and he has sent his spirit to
[2:24:15] back it up
[2:24:17] he's going to bring himself a bride
[2:24:20] praise the lord
[2:24:22] whether we can
[2:24:23] uh stand
[2:24:25] all the the negative thing that is said
[2:24:27] about the message on that whether we can
[2:24:29] stand the pressure of the age that does
[2:24:31] not matter to god he have already spoken
[2:24:41] praise the lord
[2:24:46] the bride is just responding to her
[2:24:49] anointing
[2:24:52] and what is that anointing
[2:24:54] revelation 4 1 come up higher
[2:24:59] you got to step up a little bit in your
[2:25:00] worship
[2:25:02] step up a little bit
[2:25:04] praise the lord you can't continue to
[2:25:06] just just with that uh uh uh uh day in
[2:25:10] and day out you got to step up a little
[2:25:12] bit
[2:25:13] come up higher
[2:25:16] that's our call
[2:25:19] that's our call to the rapture that's
[2:25:21] our call to the resurrection to come up
[2:25:23] higher
[2:25:27] we must be inspired every day
[2:25:32] to live a better day better life than
[2:25:34] yesterday
[2:25:38] we must be inspired every day because
[2:25:40] that is our call
[2:25:42] that is the voice of revelation 4 1.
[2:25:44] come up higher
[2:25:46] that's brother branham called the
[2:25:47] rapture
[2:25:54] that's the place where every message
[2:25:55] must pull auto
[2:25:58] that is the place where every experience
[2:26:00] in our life must pull or to why because
[2:26:02] that is our anointing
[2:26:06] if god is allowing us to go through
[2:26:09] things he is anointing us for us to come
[2:26:11] up higher
[2:26:14] for a step away from our own way of
[2:26:16] thinking and denominational way of
[2:26:18] thinking family bound word of thinking
[2:26:20] and step up into the world take the
[2:26:22] promise of god
[2:26:24] and say god your words headed i can

[2:27:05] opening ourself
[2:27:08] we'll be opening ourselves up
[2:27:11] for evil
[2:27:14] spirits praise the lord
[2:27:20] he says you will just be opening
[2:27:21] yourself up for evil spirit why because
[2:27:24] there is no promise in the word
[2:27:31] there is no promise in the word
[2:27:34] that back's dead
[2:27:42] praise the lord
[2:27:51] we are trying to obligate god to go in a
[2:27:53] reverse
[2:27:55] when god is moving forward
[2:28:04] we are saying you have to stop right
[2:28:06] here you have to go you have to reverse
[2:28:08] back
[2:28:18] when an age god has brought us his word
[2:28:23] it looks so
[2:28:24] common to the people
[2:28:27] take the word and apply
[2:28:30] praise the lord
[2:28:35] we can only feel that god is moving when
[2:28:37] we create some sense of emotion
[2:28:44] praise the lord
[2:28:48] take the word
[2:28:50] and move forward

[2:30:40] brother brown says when we read you read
[2:30:42] the faucet box of mata he says you look
[2:30:45] at the life of those early christians
[2:30:47] [Music]
[2:30:48] and you say oh god
[2:30:50] see the things that went through
[2:30:53] but abraham says they look down to your
[2:30:56] age
[2:30:57] and they say
[2:30:58] wow those believers in laodicea wow
[2:31:07] we never had to deal with
[2:31:09] a lot of media power in the air
[2:31:12] [Music]
[2:31:21] they are they are they are their
[2:31:23] spiritual atmosphere is so cloudy
[2:31:26] [Music]
[2:31:29] ours is so cloudy
[2:31:33] praise the lord
[2:31:36] [Music]
[2:31:38] those all things are
[2:31:40] our saints we get down on their knees
[2:31:42] and pray then and and they will be there
[2:31:44] the bible says ananias praying right
[2:31:46] there and god break a vision to him
[2:31:48] and say i'm sending paul to you
[2:31:50] praise the lord
[2:31:53] our age is so clouded that it's hard for
[2:31:57] us to have a vision because we have it
[2:31:59] right in our hands called a cell phone
[2:32:03] we don't find a time to pray we just go
[2:32:04] search on google and
[2:32:06] type this one and who is this person and
[2:32:09] we just handle it right in our hands
[2:32:11] [Music]
[2:32:23] if you know how all the media facilities
[2:32:26] that we have
[2:32:28] they spend night and night in your bible
[2:32:31] better brandon will talk about uh
[2:32:32] susanna wesley
[2:32:35] how she raised her children
[2:32:39] with all of those boys that she had
[2:32:42] i mean you think about it to have 17
[2:32:44] rooms with 17 televisions 17 remote
[2:32:47] control and all the boys can look at
[2:32:49] whatever movie they want to look at they
[2:32:51] never had those facilities so what she
[2:32:53] did every night she sat down they sat
[2:32:56] there they said before her and she took
[2:32:58] the bible and starts to read a story and
[2:33:01] create a picture in your mind
[2:33:04] and create a picture of about joseph and
[2:33:06] read about easter and jacob
[2:33:08] she become she become a television to
[2:33:11] them
[2:33:16] but when they look down at our age and
[2:33:18] see the kind of spirits that we are
[2:33:20] dealing with
[2:33:21] see the things that is buffering our
[2:33:23] mind the thing our young people are
[2:33:25] fixed up with they say oh my god
[2:33:28] oh my god i thought my days were bad
[2:33:31] i thought be fair to the lion were evil
[2:33:34] but see the thing that laudisha church
[2:33:36] people minds are going through
[2:33:38] [Music]
[2:33:42] as soon as you come from the presence of
[2:33:44] god an evil 12 slaps your mind
[2:33:47] that they have a watch in every way to
[2:33:49] make you to misunderstand things
[2:33:51] misunderstand someone's action
[2:33:53] the pressing not meaning any evil to you
[2:33:55] they just do something you make a
[2:33:56] conclusion
[2:33:58] he's a rolling lion visit
[2:34:04] that's what we are faced with that's the
[2:34:05] age we are faced with
[2:34:20] if it is not coming on your phone it's
[2:34:22] it's it's it's uh it's either on the
[2:34:24] poster it's in a book it's on a stream i
[2:34:27] mean it's just all over us
[2:34:29] it's all around us
[2:34:38] and then in the midst of this
[2:34:40] the bible says god has given his angers
[2:34:43] to to income about us
[2:34:46] can you feed the spiritual warfare that
[2:34:48] is going around you when the end when
[2:34:50] the enemy is there to just destroy your
[2:34:56] mind not a dead i would go by and you
[2:34:59] see all the violence
[2:35:02] a man would take gun on his own children
[2:35:06] a boy would take gun on his siblings
[2:35:08] what is happening what what is causing
[2:35:10] that evil spirit that is screaming to
[2:35:13] the minds of the people
[2:35:15] what is causing that
[2:35:22] evil spirit that is overtaking the
[2:35:24] people in this age
[2:35:26] and it's the same spirit that is income
[2:35:28] about you and myself but god has given
[2:35:31] angels around you to fight every time
[2:35:34] change your mind
[2:35:41] every time your mind is coming on a
[2:35:43] suppression
[2:35:44] god where a lie has thought to slip in
[2:35:47] remember the lord that god
[2:35:49] he will remember that talk to sleeping
[2:35:51] and then you will step back
[2:35:55] but the same evil spirit that is
[2:35:56] streaming to your mind is also screaming
[2:35:59] to your mind
[2:36:02] and if the law was not i will help
[2:36:08] will be lying in our own blood
[2:36:20] that's the age that we have to deal with
[2:36:23] that's the reason why we might not take
[2:36:25] these things for granted people
[2:36:29] we might not take these things for
[2:36:30] granted
[2:36:32] let's run to calvary if we need god if
