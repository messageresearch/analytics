[0:06] they said that they were rich in goods
[0:08] and spiritually wealthy they had arrived
[0:11] they had need of nothing
[0:13] but god saw it otherwise
[0:15] he said
[0:16] you don't know this but you are wretched
[0:18] miserable poor blind and naked
[0:22] now when a people are that way
[0:23] especially naked and don't know it
[0:26] there has to be something awfully wrong
[0:29] surely something must be happening
[0:31] is it not that god has blinded their
[0:33] eyes as he did to the jews
[0:35] is the gospel going back to the jews is
[0:38] history repeating itself
[0:40] i say it is
[0:42] god says this church of the laodicean
[0:44] age is wretched
[0:46] that word comes from two greek words
[0:48] which mean endure and trial
[0:50] and it has nothing to do with the trials
[0:52] that come to a true christian for god
[0:54] describes a christian in trial as
[0:56] blessed
[0:57] and his attitude one of joy
[0:59] whereas this description is phrased as
[1:02] wretched and miserable
[1:04] how strange
[1:05] in this age of plenty in this age of
[1:07] progress in this age of abundance how
[1:10] can there be trials
[1:12] well no it is strange
[1:14] but in this age of plenty and
[1:15] opportunity when everyone has so much
[1:18] and there is so much more to be had
[1:20] but with all the inventions to do our
[1:22] work and so many things to give us
[1:24] pleasure suddenly we find mental illness
[1:27] taking such a toll as to alarm the
[1:28] nation
[1:30] when everybody ought to be happy with
[1:32] really nothing to be unhappy about
[1:34] millions are taking sedatives at night
[1:36] pep pills in the morning rushing to
[1:39] doctors entering institutions and trying
[1:41] to drown out unknown fears by alcohol
[1:44] yes this age boasts of its tremendous
[1:46] stories of worldly goods
[1:48] but the people are less happy than ever
[1:51] this age boasts of its spiritual
[1:52] attainments but the people are less sure
[1:55] of themselves than ever
[1:57] this age boasts of better moral values
[2:00] and it is more corrupt than any age
[2:01] since the flood
[2:03] it talks about its knowledge and science
[2:05] but it is fighting a losing battle in
[2:07] all fields for the human mind and soul
[2:10] and spirit cannot comprehend or keep
[2:12] abreast with all the changes that have
[2:14] come upon the earth
[2:16] in one generation we have gone all the
[2:18] way from the horse and buggy age to the
[2:20] space age and we are proud and boastful
[2:23] about it
[2:25] but inside is a dark void cavern that is
[2:27] crying out in torment and without a
[2:30] known reason
[2:31] man's hearts are failing for fear and
[2:34] the world is so darkened that this age
[2:36] could well be called the age of
[2:37] neurotics
[2:39] it boasts but it cannot back it up it
[2:41] cries peace and there is no peace
[2:44] it cries that it has a great amplitude
[2:45] of all things but it keeps burning with
[2:48] desire like an unsatisfied fire
[2:50] there is no peace
[2:52] sayeth my god to the wicked
[2:56] they are miserable
[2:58] that means that they are objects to be
[3:00] pitied pitied
[3:02] they scorn pity they are full of pride
[3:05] they want what they have
[3:07] but what they have will not stand the
[3:09] test of time
[3:11] they have built upon quicksand rather
[3:13] than the rock of the revelation of god's
[3:14] word
[3:16] soon cometh the earthquake soon there
[3:18] will come the storms of the wrath of god
[3:20] in judgment
[3:22] then comes sudden destruction and in
[3:24] spite of all their carnal preparation
[3:27] they will still be unprepared for what
[3:28] comes upon the earth
[3:31] they are those who in spite of all their
[3:32] worldly efforts are actually opposing
[3:34] themselves and don't know it
[3:37] objects of pity are they indeed
[3:39] pity the poor people who are in this
[3:41] last day ecumenical move
[3:43] for they call it the move of god when it
[3:45] is of satan
[3:47] pity those who do not know the curse of
[3:49] organization
[3:50] pity those who have so many beautiful
[3:52] churches such lovely parsonages such
[3:55] grandly trained choirs such a show of
[3:57] wealth and such a sedate and reverent
[3:59] form of worship
[4:01] pity them don't envy them
[4:03] back to the old store buildings back to
[4:05] the dimly lit rooms back to the sellers
[4:08] back to less of the world and more of
[4:10] god
[4:12] pity those who make their great claims
[4:14] and talk about their gifts
[4:16] feel for them as objects of pity
[4:18] for soon they will be objects of wrath
[4:22] they are poor
[6:02] they are poor
[6:04] now of course that means spiritually
[6:06] poor
[6:07] the sign of this age as it closes is
[6:09] bigger and better churches with more and
[6:11] more people with more and more
[6:13] manifestation of what is supposed to be
[6:15] demonstrations of the holy ghost
[6:18] but the filled altars the gifts of the
[6:20] spirit in operation the remarkable
[6:22] attendance is not the answer from god
[6:26] for those who come to the altars very
[6:27] seldom stay to go on with god
[6:30] and after the great campaigns are
[6:32] finished where are all those who came
[6:34] down the aisles
[6:35] they heard a man they listened to an
[6:37] appeal they came into the net
[6:40] but they were not fish and turtle-like
[6:42] they crawled back to their own waters
[6:45] then there is all this talk about the
[6:47] glossolalia
[6:48] it is supposed to be the evidence of the
[6:50] baptism of the holy ghost and people are
[6:52] thinking that we are in the midst of a
[6:54] great revival
[6:55] the revival is over
[6:57] america had her last chance in 1957
[7:01] now the tongues are god's sign of
[7:02] impending disaster even as they were
[7:05] when they appeared upon the wall at
[7:06] belshazzar's feast
[7:08] don't you know that many are going to
[7:10] come in the last day and say
[7:12] lord lord have we not done many
[7:14] wonderful works in thy name even to the
[7:16] casting out of devils
[7:18] and he will say
[7:20] depart from me ye that work iniquity i
[7:22] never knew you
[7:24] matthew 7 22-23
[7:28] jesus said they were workers of iniquity
[7:30] yet you get a man that can come and pray
[7:32] for the sick get oil and blood appearing
[7:35] in the congregation
[7:36] prophecy coming forth and all manner of
[7:38] the supernatural
[7:40] and the people will gather around him
[7:42] and swear that he is of the lord
[7:44] even though he is actually making a
[7:46] money racket of religion and living in
[7:47] sin
[7:49] the only answer they have is the
[7:50] absolutely unbiblical answer of
[7:53] well he gets results so he must be of
[7:55] god
[7:56] how terrible how actually poor this age
[7:59] is in the spirit of god
[8:01] and the poor poverty-stricken ones don't
[8:03] even know it
[8:06] you are blind and naked
[8:08] now this is really desperate
[8:11] how can anyone be blind and naked and
[8:13] not know it
[8:14] yet it says that they are blind and
[8:16] naked and can't perceive it
[8:18] the answer is they are spiritually blind
[8:20] and spiritually naked
[8:22] do you remember when elisha and gehey's
[8:24] eye were surrounded by the army of the
[8:26] syrians you recall that elisha smote
[8:29] them blind by the power of god
[8:31] yet their eyes were wide open and they
[8:33] could see where they were going
[8:35] the blindness was peculiar and that they
[8:37] could see certain things but other
[8:39] certain things such as elisha and the
[8:41] servant and the camp of israel they
[8:43] could not see
[8:44] what this army could see did not avail
[8:46] for them
[8:47] what they did not see brought on their
[8:49] captivity
[8:50] now what does this mean to us
[8:53] it means exactly what it meant back
[8:55] there in the earthly ministry of jesus
[8:57] he tried to teach them truth but they
[8:59] would not listen
[9:01] john 9 40 through 41
[9:04] and some of the pharisees which were
[9:06] with him heard these words and said unto
[9:08] him are we blind also
[9:11] jesus said unto them
[9:13] if ye were blind you should have no sin
[9:15] but now you say we see
[9:17] therefore your sin remaineth
[9:20] the attitude of this age is exactly what
[9:22] it was then
[9:24] people have it all
[9:26] they know it all they cannot be taught
[9:29] if a point of truth from the word comes
[9:31] up and the man tries to explain his view
[9:33] to one with an opposing view
[9:35] the listener is not at all listening
[9:36] that he might learn but is listening
[9:38] only to refute what is being said
[9:40] now i want to ask a fair question
[9:43] can scripture fight scripture
[9:45] does the bible contradict the bible
[9:48] can there be two doctrines of truth in
[9:50] the word that say the opposite or oppose
[9:52] the other
[9:53] no it cannot be so
[9:56] yet how many of god's people have their
[9:58] eyes open to that truth
[10:00] not even one percent as far as i know
[10:03] have learned that all scripture is given
[10:04] by god and all is profitable for
[10:07] doctrine reproof correction etc
[10:10] if all scripture is thusly given then
[10:13] every verse will dovetail if given a
[10:15] chance
[10:16] but how many believe in predestination
[10:18] unto election and reprobation unto
[10:20] destruction
[10:21] those who don't will they listen
[10:24] no they will not
[10:25] yet both are in the word and nothing
[10:28] will change it
[10:29] but to learn about it and reconcile the
[10:31] truth of those doctrines with other
[10:33] truths that seem to oppose they will not
[10:35] take the time
[10:37] but they stop their ears and gnash with
[10:39] their teeth and they lose out
[10:41] at the end of this age a prophet will
[10:43] come but they will be blind to all that
[10:45] he is doing and saying
[10:47] they are so sure they are right and in
[10:49] their blindness they will lose it all
[10:52] now god says they are naked as well as
[10:54] blind
[10:56] i cannot imagine anything as tragic as a
[10:58] man who is blind and naked and does not
[11:00] know it
[11:01] there is only one answer
[11:03] he is out of his mind
[11:05] he is already deep in oblivion his
[11:08] faculties are gone spiritual amnesia has
[11:10] set in
[11:11] what else can it mean
[11:13] can it mean that the holy spirit has
[11:15] taken his leave of this last day church
[11:18] can it mean that men have put god out of
[11:20] their minds to such an extent that it is
[11:22] happening even as stated in romans 1 28
[11:26] and even as they did not like to retain
[11:28] god in their knowledge
[11:30] god gave them over to reprobate minds to
[11:33] do those things which are not convenient
[11:36] it surely appears that something like
[11:37] that has happened
[11:39] here is a people who say that they are
[11:41] of god and know god and have his holy
[11:43] spirit and yet they are naked and blind
[11:45] and don't know it
[11:47] they are already deceived
[11:50] they have the wrong spirit the elect
[11:52] cannot be deceived but it is evident
[11:54] that these others are
[11:57] these are they who have become blind
[11:59] because they refused the word of god
[12:01] these are they who have stripped
[12:02] themselves naked by leaving god's care
[12:05] and protection
[12:06] and sought to build their own way of
[12:08] salvation their own tower of babel by
[12:11] organization
[12:13] oh how lovely and beautifully dressed
[12:15] they appear in their own eyes as they
[12:17] form their general assemblies and their
[12:19] councils etc
[12:21] but now god is stripping it all away and
[12:23] they are naked for these organizations
[12:26] have but led them into the camp of
[12:27] antichrist
[12:29] into the field of tears right up to
[12:31] their binding and burning
[12:33] objects of pity indeed they are
[12:36] yes pity them warn them beseech them and
[12:38] still they go their way headlong to
[12:40] destruction wrathfully turning away any
[12:43] and all attempts to save them as brands
[12:45] from the burning
[12:46] miserable indeed they are yet they know
[12:49] it not
[12:50] calloused and beyond hope they glory in
[12:52] what is actually their shame
[12:54] defiant against the word
[12:56] yet one day they shall be judged by it
[12:58] and pay the price of its awful
[12:59] indictments
[13:02] the final council of the
[13:04] ages revelation 3 18-19
[13:09] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[13:12] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[13:14] white raiment that thou mayest be
[13:16] clothed
[13:17] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[13:18] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[13:21] eyes have that thou mayest see
[13:24] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[13:27] be zealous therefore and repent
[13:30] the counsel of god is terse it is to the
[13:33] point
[13:34] he directs this last day church to one
[13:36] hope
[13:37] that hope is himself
[13:39] he says
[13:40] come to me and by
[13:43] it is evident from this phrase
[13:45] by of me
[13:46] that the laodicean church is not at all
[13:48] dealing with jesus for the spiritual
[13:50] products of the kingdom of god
[13:53] their transactions cannot be spiritual
[13:55] they may think that they are spiritual
[13:57] but how can they be
[13:59] the works in their midst are definitely
[14:01] not as paul would say
[14:03] god in you willing and doing of his own
[14:06] good pleasure
[14:07] philippians 2 13
[14:10] thus what about all these churches
[14:12] schools hospitals missionary ventures
[14:14] etc
[14:16] god is not in them as long as they are
[14:18] denominational seed and spirit and not
[14:20] the seed and spirit of god
[14:23] by of me gold tried in the fire that you
[14:26] may be rich
[14:28] now these people had plenty of gold but
[14:30] it was the wrong kind
[14:32] it was that gold that bought man's lives
[14:34] and destroyed them it was the gold that
[14:36] warped and twisted human character for
[14:39] its love was the root of all evil
[14:41] revelation 18 1-14
[14:45] and after these things i saw another
[14:47] angel come down from heaven having great
[14:49] power
[14:50] and the earth was lightened with his
[14:52] glory
[14:53] and he cried mightily with a strong
[14:54] voice saying
[14:56] babylon the great is fallen is fallen
[14:58] and has become the habitation of devils
[15:01] and the hold of every foul spirit and a
[15:03] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[15:06] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[15:08] of the wrath of her fornication
[15:10] and the kings of the earth have
[15:12] committed fornication with her and the
[15:14] merchants of the earth are waxed rich
[15:16] through the abundance of her delicacies
[15:20] and i heard another voice from heaven
[15:21] saying
[15:22] come out of her my people that ye be not
[15:25] partakers of her sins and that you
[15:27] receive not of her plagues
[15:30] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[15:32] and god hath remembered her iniquities
[15:35] reward her even as she rewarded you and
[15:38] double unto her double according to her
[15:40] works
[15:41] in the cup which she hath filled filled
[15:43] to her double
[15:45] how much she have glorified herself and
[15:47] lived deliciously
[15:49] so much torment and sorrow give her
[15:51] for she saith in her heart
[15:53] i sit a queen and am no widow and shall
[15:56] see no sorrow
[15:58] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[16:00] day death and mourning and famine
[16:04] and she shall be utterly burned with
[16:05] fire
[16:06] for strong is the lord god who judgeth
[16:09] her
[16:10] and the kings of the earth who have
[16:11] committed fornication and lived
[16:12] deliciously with her shall bewail her
[16:15] and lament for her when they shall see
[16:17] the smoke of her burning
[16:20] standing afar off for the fear of her
[16:22] torment saying
[16:23] alas alas that great city babylon that
[16:26] mighty city for in one hour is thy
[16:28] judgment come
[16:30] and the merchants of the earth shall
[16:31] weep and mourn over her
[16:33] for no man buyeth their merchandise
[16:35] anymore
[16:36] the merchandise of gold and silver and
[16:38] precious stones and of pearls and fine
[16:41] linen and purple and silk and scarlet
[16:44] and all thy in wood
[16:46] and all manner vessels of ivory and all
[16:49] manner vessels of most precious wood and
[16:51] of brass and iron and marble and
[16:54] cinnamon and odors and ointments and
[16:57] frankincense and wine and oil and fine
[16:59] flour and wheat and beasts
[17:02] and sheep and horses and chariots and
[17:05] slaves and souls of men
[17:08] and the fruits that thy soul lusteth
[17:10] after are departed from thee
[17:12] and all things which were dainty and
[17:14] goodly are departed from thee and thou
[17:16] shalt find them no more at all
[17:19] this is exactly the organized churches
[17:21] of the last day
[17:23] for it says in verse 4
[17:25] come out of her my people
[17:28] the rapture has not yet taken place
[17:30] the bride is not yet gone when these
[17:32] terrible conditions in this rich false
[17:34] church exist
[17:36] but there is a gold of god
[17:39] first peter 1 7
[17:42] that the trial of your faith being much
[17:44] more precious than of gold that
[17:45] perisheth
[17:47] the gold of god is a christ-like
[17:49] character produced in the fiery furnace
[17:51] of affliction
[17:52] that is the right kind of gold
[17:55] but what kind of gold does the church
[17:57] have today
[17:59] it has but the worldly gold that will
[18:01] perish it is rich it is complacent
[18:04] it has made affluence the major
[18:06] criterion of spirituality
[18:08] the evidence of god's blessing and the
[18:10] correctness of doctrine etc
[18:12] is now based upon how many rich folks
[18:14] are involved in it
[18:17] you had better come before it is too
[18:18] late saith the lord
[18:21] and by of me gold tried in the fire and
[18:24] then you will be truly rich
[18:26] are we getting it
[18:28] listen to me
[18:30] naked physically we came into the world
[18:33] but naked spiritually we will not leave
[18:36] it
[18:37] oh no we are going to take something
[18:38] with us
[18:40] what that something is is all we can
[18:42] take with us nothing less and nothing
[18:44] more
[18:45] so we had better be real careful now to
[18:47] see that we take something that will
[18:49] make us right before god
[18:51] so then what will we take with us
[18:54] we will take our character brother that
[18:56] is what we will take with us
[18:58] now what kind of character will you take
[19:00] with you
[19:01] will it be like his whose character was
[19:03] molded by suffering in the fiery furnace
[19:05] of affliction
[19:06] or will it be the softness of this
[19:08] character-less laodicean people
[19:11] it is up to each one of us
[19:13] for in that day every man will bear his
[19:15] own burden
[19:18] now i said that the city of laodicea was
[19:20] a wealthy city
[19:21] admitted gold coins with inscriptions on
[19:23] both sides
[19:25] gold coins characterized the age a
[19:27] flourishing commerce existed because of
[19:29] it
[19:31] today the two-headed gold coin is with
[19:33] us
[19:34] we buy ourselves out and we buy
[19:35] ourselves in
[19:37] in the church we attempt to accomplish
[19:39] the same
[19:40] we buy ourselves out of sin and by
[19:42] ourselves into heaven or so we say
[19:46] but god does not say that
[19:48] the church owns such phenomenal wealth
[19:50] that at any given time she can take over
[19:52] the entire world system of commerce and
[19:55] indeed a leader in the world council of
[19:56] churches has openly prophesied that the
[19:59] church and the foreseeable future should
[20:01] could and will do just that
[20:04] but their golden tower of babel shall
[20:06] fall
[20:07] only the gold tried in the fire shall
[20:09] endure
[20:11] and that is what the church has
[20:12] constantly done through the ages
[20:15] she has left the word of god and taken
[20:17] her own creeds and dogmas
[20:19] she has organized and joined herself to
[20:21] the world
[20:22] thus is she naked and god is judging her
[20:25] lewdness
[20:26] the only way she can get out of this
[20:28] dread situation is by obeying the lord
[20:30] to come back to his word revelation 18 4
[20:35] come out of her my people
[20:37] second corinthians 6 14-18
[20:41] be not unequally yoked together with
[20:43] unbelievers
[20:44] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[20:46] with unrighteousness
[20:48] and what communion hath light with
[20:50] darkness
[20:51] and what concord hath christ with belial
[20:53] or what part have he that believeth with
[20:55] an infidel
[20:57] and what agreement hath the temple of
[20:58] god with idols
[21:00] for ye are the temple of the living god
[21:02] as god hath said
[21:04] i will dwell in them and walk in them
[21:06] and i will be their god and they shall
[21:08] be my people
[21:10] wherefore come out from among them and
[21:12] be ye separate saith the lord and touch
[21:15] not the unclean thing and i will receive
[21:18] you
[21:18] and i will be a father unto you and ye
[21:21] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[21:23] lord almighty
[21:25] there is a price to pay for those
[21:27] garments
[21:28] and that is the price of separation
[21:31] and anoint thine eyes with eyes that
[21:33] thou mightest see
[21:36] he does not say that you have to buy
[21:38] this i salve oh no there is no price tag
[21:41] on the holy spirit
[21:43] received ye the spirit by the works of
[21:45] the law or the hearing of faith
[21:47] galatians 3 2
[21:49] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[21:51] you can never have your eyes opened to a
[21:53] true spiritual revelation of the word
[21:56] a man without the spirit is blind to god
[21:59] and his truth
[22:01] when i think of this isab opening
[22:03] people's eyes i can't help but recall
[22:05] when i was a little boy in kentucky
[22:08] my brother and i slept in the attic on a
[22:10] straw pallet
[22:11] the cracks in the house would let the
[22:12] drafts blow through
[22:14] sometimes in the winter it would get so
[22:16] cold
[22:17] we would wake up in the morning with
[22:19] such colds in our eyes that our eyes
[22:20] would be shut tight with inflammation
[22:23] we would cry out to mother and up she
[22:25] would come with some hot grease and
[22:27] rub our eyes until the hardened matter
[22:29] was gone and then we could see
[22:32] you know there have been some awful cold
[22:34] drafts blowing on the church in this
[22:36] generation
[22:37] and i'm afraid her eyes have sort of
[22:39] frozen shut and she is blind to what god
[22:41] has for her
[22:43] she needs some hot oil of the spirit of
[22:45] god to open her eyes
[22:47] unless she receives the spirit of god
[22:50] she will go on substituting program for
[22:52] power and creed for word
[22:54] she counts numbers for success rather
[22:57] than to look for fruit
[22:59] the doctors of theology have shut the
[23:01] door to faith and for bad all to enter
[23:04] they neither go in nor let anyone else
[23:06] go in
[23:07] their theology comes out of a textbook
[23:09] on psychology written by some unbeliever
[23:12] there is a textbook on psychology one we
[23:15] all need
[23:16] it is the bible
[23:18] it is written by god and contains god's
[23:20] psychology
[23:21] you don't need any doctor to explain it
[23:23] to you
[23:24] receive ye the holy spirit and let him
[23:26] do the explaining
[23:28] he wrote the book and he can tell you
[23:30] what is in it and what it means
[23:32] first corinthians 2 9-16
[23:36] but as it is written
[23:38] i hath not seen nor ear heard neither
[23:41] have entered into the heart of man the
[23:43] things which god hath prepared for them
[23:45] that love him
[23:47] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[23:49] his spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[23:51] things yea the deep things of god
[23:54] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[23:57] save the spirit of man which is in him
[24:00] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[24:02] but the spirit of god
[24:05] now we have received not the spirit of
[24:06] the world but the spirit which is of god
[24:09] that we might know the things that are
[24:11] freely given to us of god
[24:14] which things also we speak not in the
[24:16] words which man's wisdom teacheth
[24:18] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[24:20] comparing spiritual things with
[24:22] spiritual
[24:23] but the natural man receiveth not the
[24:25] things of the spirit of god
[24:27] for they are foolishness unto him
[24:29] neither can he know them because they
[24:31] are spiritually discerned
[24:33] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[24:36] things
[24:37] yet he himself is judged of no man
[24:40] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[24:42] that he may instruct him
[24:44] but we have the mind of christ
[24:47] now if all the things that the spirit is
[24:49] crying out against are true of this age
[24:51] we need someone to come on the scene as
[24:53] did john the baptist and challenge the
[24:55] church as never before
[24:57] and that is exactly what is coming to
[24:59] our age
[25:00] another john the baptist is coming and
[25:02] he will cry out exactly as did the first
[25:04] forerunner
[25:06] we know that he will because of what the
[25:08] next verse says
[25:11] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[25:14] be zealous therefore and repent
[25:17] revelation 3 19
[25:24] this is the same message that john had
[25:26] as he cried out in that religious
[25:27] wilderness of pharisees sadducees and
[25:30] heathen
[25:31] repent
[25:32] there was no other course then there is
[25:34] no other course now
[25:36] there was no other way to get back to
[25:38] god then and there is no other way now
[25:41] it is repent change your mind turn
[25:44] around
[25:45] repent for why will ye die
[25:48] let us examine the first phrase as many
[25:50] as i love
[25:52] in the greek the emphasis is upon the
[25:54] personal pronoun i
[25:56] he does not say as many would feel he
[25:58] should say
[25:59] as many as love me
[26:01] no sir
[26:02] we must never try to make jesus the
[26:04] object of human love in this verse
[26:07] no
[26:08] it is the many that are the loved ones
[26:10] of god
[26:11] it is his love in question not ours
[26:15] so once again we find ourselves glorying
[26:17] in his salvation his purpose and his
[26:19] plan
[26:20] and we are confirmed even more strongly
[26:22] in the truth of the doctrine of the
[26:24] sovereignty of god
[26:26] even as he said in romans 9 13
[26:29] jacob have i loved
[26:31] does it now obtain that since he loved
[26:33] only the many
[26:35] is he therefore in a state of
[26:37] complacency
[26:38] awaiting the love of those who have not
[26:40] drawn nigh him
[26:41] by no means is this so
[26:43] for he declared also in romans 9 13
[26:47] he saw have i hated
[26:49] and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls
[26:52] out
[26:52] for the children not being born neither
[26:54] having done any good or evil that the
[26:57] purpose of god according to election
[26:59] might stand
[27:00] not of works but of him that calleth
[27:04] this love is elective love
[27:06] it is his love for his elect
[27:08] and his love for them is apart from
[27:10] human merit for it says that the purpose
[27:13] of god stands in election which is
[27:15] exactly opposite to works or anything
[27:17] man has in himself
[27:19] because
[27:21] before the children were born
[27:23] he had already said
[27:25] jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
[27:29] [Music]
[27:54] you
