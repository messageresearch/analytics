[48:25] One time, brother brother says he don't
[48:29] know where I get my songs from.
[48:37] He says uh uh he don't know. So um I was
[48:42] thinking on the song and then I remember
[48:44] when he said that I started laughing to
[48:46] myself. I said, I know when I start
[48:47] singing this one again, he says, "Where
[48:49] did this guy get these things from?"
[48:51] Praise the Lord. You know, it's an old
[48:53] old uh Sunday school song we used to
[48:56] sing uh that says uh uh
[49:01] uh oh, I I wrote a song and I sent it
[49:04] over back there to the to the uh tech
[49:08] people if I can just remember the song.
[49:11] Uh
[49:15] oh man.
[49:16] And you see that just how it happens
[49:19] when you're thinking about it or want to
[49:21] get it does not come to your mind. But
[49:24] um
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's let's do Hallelujah.

[50:52] I'm walking with the king every day and
[50:56] I'm walking with the king.
[51:01] If you are not walking, it's not what
[51:05] I'm talking
[51:07] walking on the king's highway.
[51:13] There will be a blessing
[51:15] as you go confessing
[51:18] walking on the king's highway.
[51:23] Oh, this highway

[52:48] Thank you, musicians. We will we will

[53:04] Oh yeah. Okay. The song I was thinking
[53:06] about is that we are we are traveling.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we we are traveling
[53:12] &gt;&gt; to a land
[53:15] on our way to heaven.
[53:19] That song started playing in my head the
[53:20] whole week. I was just, oh my God, I'm
[53:24] going to sing this morning in church
[53:25] again.
[53:27] Praise the Lord. No, I'm not going to do
[53:30] no right or left for you.
[53:34] Oh,
[53:35] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's take let's take our Bibles.
[53:55] I knew I as I was singing I was thinking
[53:57] about that left for rightful thing,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; but uh I put some other words to it. Um,
[54:06] Genesis chapter 1. Let's take Genesis
[54:08] chapter one
[54:10] &gt;&gt; this morning.
[54:13] I was I was kind of studying on
[54:15] something and then uh
[54:19] uh I ran into to something and I want to
[54:23] share with you. So portion of my uh
[54:26] preaching this morning will be
[54:28] information but I hope that the Holy
[54:30] Ghost will will use it to to bring uh
[54:38] inspiration to you. Amen.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; I hope the information will bring
[54:43] inspiration to you because it's the
[54:46] inspiration of the almighty that gives
[54:48] life. Amen. Amen.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Is uh the word inspiration means the
[54:52] breath of God.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; So uh Genesis chapter 1, let's read
[54:57] verse 11. Genesis chapter 1 verse 11.
[55:06] And God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[55:10] grass,
[55:12] the herbs yelling seeds, and the fruit
[55:15] trees yelling fruit after his kind,
[55:22] whose seed is in itself
[55:26] upon the earth, and it was so." Praise
[55:29] the Lord.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So let every seed bring forth of his
[55:33] kind. Let's pray together. Father, in
[55:35] the name of Jesus Christ, this morning,
[55:38] we want to just humbly approach you,
[55:40] Lord, Father God, and ask for your help
[55:43] this morning, oh God, because uh none of
[55:45] us, Lord, have the right, Lord God, to
[55:48] handle this word except Lord Jesus, you
[55:52] come and help us, Lord. I pray that
[55:54] Lord, you would just open it to our
[55:56] hearts and speak to us this morning in
[55:58] Jesus name. Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I might be all over the place, but
[56:04] just follow me. Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Just follow me. The Lord bless you. You
[56:07] may have your seat.
[56:10] Praise the Lord. Now, guess what I was I
[56:12] was thinking about and what I've been
[56:14] studying on. Actually, I've been looking
[56:17] at what Rod Brown talks about uh uh in
[56:20] the in the message. Spoken word is the
[56:22] original seed, the the prophecy he said
[56:26] the Lord gave him when the Lord told him
[56:27] to pick up his pen and write. Now
[56:30] there's a there's a lot of things in
[56:32] there that been that have been coming to
[56:33] me and if I have time I will share some
[56:35] with you if not today but there is
[56:38] something that I wanted to speak about
[56:41] and that took me back there to to go and
[56:44] and and study that closely and uh so
[56:48] while I was looking at that uh uh pick
[56:52] up your pen I started looking in the
[56:55] scripture and just to see how many times
[56:58] God spoke about picking up pens to
[57:01] write.
[57:02] And uh uh uh uh Job said in Job chapter
[57:08] 19,
[57:10] Job chapter 19,
[57:12] let's uh let's read that. Job chapter 19
[57:17] verse 29.
[57:19] Um
[57:22] Job said uh he said these words,
[57:28] "Praise the Lord."
[57:37] &gt;&gt; No, I said 29. I'm wrong, guys. 24.
[57:42] Job uh
[57:44] 19:24. I'm I'm looking at what they put
[57:47] up there. I'm saying that's what I said,
[57:50] but that's what I said.
[57:53] 24. Let's look at verse 24. It's a very
[57:55] famous scripture,
[57:59] very famous scripture. When you look at
[58:01] verse 23, he says, "Oh, that my words
[58:06] were written, all that they were printed
[58:10] in a book."
[58:12] Praise the Lord. Now he's going through
[58:15] his trial and he's uh wanting a record
[58:18] on it. Now so there there are a lot of
[58:21] there are a lot of uh uh uh I don't know
[58:24] what I can say argument or information
[58:27] that whether the book of Job was written
[58:29] by Job himself or it was written by
[58:32] Moses because the book of Job is one of
[58:35] the oldest book in the Bible and Moses
[58:38] wrote the first five books of the Bible.
[58:41] Moses was not living in the time of Job.
[58:44] Job lived before Moses. Abraham laid
[58:47] before Moses. Noah laid before Moses.
[58:50] But we know that Moses by vision wrote
[58:53] the book of Genesis. And uh so uh uh uh
[58:58] so lot lot of scholars uh you know want
[59:00] to attribute the writing of the book of
[59:02] Job to Moses. We don't have any account
[59:05] on that. But uh but we see Job here
[59:10] desiring that his words will be written.
[59:15] Praise the Lord.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; But he says something that is very very
[59:19] very very profound that uh I never saw
[59:23] until I started studying on this. He
[59:24] says, "Oh that my words were written or
[59:27] that they were printed in a book. All
[59:31] that all uh I mean that they were
[59:34] engraved with an iron pen
[59:39] and led and laid in the rock forever.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. All that they were engraved with
[59:48] an iron pen.
[59:51] Now uh that iron pen is uh is a word
[59:57] that is used by structure and that is
[1:00:01] the way that you write on a rock. So if
[1:00:04] a structure takes a machine and he's
[1:00:07] writing he's he's hitting it and trying
[1:00:10] to make a B c on a rock that thing he's
[1:00:15] holding that that chaser he's holding in
[1:00:17] his hand will be called an iron pan.
[1:00:20] True.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because that's the only
[1:00:23] way you can write on the rock. For a
[1:00:26] word to be engraving on the rock, it has
[1:00:29] to be written by an iron pen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; This is not an iron pen. It can write on
[1:00:36] rock.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; This is a paper pen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Now, so that that just studying that it
[1:00:45] it really hit me in the face. It hit me
[1:00:48] in the face quickly and I say, "Oh,
[1:00:51] there is something here. There is
[1:00:52] something that Job is saying that is
[1:00:56] very, very prophetic."
[1:00:59] Because God wrote on the rock.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; The tablets were rocks.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; The tablets were the ten commandments
[1:01:09] were written on. They were they were
[1:01:11] they were tablets that were cut from the
[1:01:14] rock and God himself wrote on the rock.
[1:01:17] So God wrote on the rock with an iron
[1:01:19] pen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; By the way, merry Christmas.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:37] now. So, um it it it really you know it
[1:01:41] caught my attention and uh and then I
[1:01:43] started looking looking uh uh more than
[1:01:46] looking at pain. I'm I started looking
[1:01:48] at iron pain which of course that's not
[1:01:52] the first time that God said it uh uh or
[1:01:55] not. The first time the Bible will use
[1:01:57] that word the next time it will use that
[1:01:59] word will be in Jeremiah.
[1:02:02] Now, so God will use that word in
[1:02:05] Jeremiah talking to the the children of
[1:02:08] Israel, talking to the people of Judah
[1:02:11] because they have indulged themselves in
[1:02:14] idolatry. They had h many different
[1:02:18] forms of idols that they were
[1:02:20] worshiping. Praise the Lord.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm really intending to shock
[1:02:26] you this morning. That's really that's
[1:02:29] that's what I'm intending to do. So, let
[1:02:32] me warn you
[1:02:34] before we get there. Amen. So, just hold
[1:02:38] hold fast to your seat that if I shock
[1:02:42] you, you won't drop on the ground. Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; If you fall, we'll pick you up. I
[1:02:47] promise. Praise the Lord.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like I said, we'll be all
[1:02:53] over the place. I'm not sure I might get
[1:02:55] to my to my subject I want to talk on
[1:02:57] this morning, but uh uh
[1:03:03] we get there. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; You ready for the word?
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Well, because I say I will shock you.
[1:03:11] You You are not responding.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And I don't know what you came for.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. I won't shock you. I will embrace
[1:03:20] you. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; And we embrace you with the word. Amen.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So if if we look in
[1:03:28] Jeremiah chapter 17, let's look in
[1:03:30] Jeremiah chapter 17. This there there's
[1:03:34] a whole lot here we have to deal with
[1:03:36] people. We have we having a whole lot
[1:03:38] here. We having uh
[1:03:42] a full a full meal here that we can I
[1:03:45] can I can easily preach for three four
[1:03:48] hours, but I will keep you for that
[1:03:50] long. Now, so if you look in Jeremiah
[1:03:52] chapter 17,
[1:03:55] uh, verse one, the sin of Judah is
[1:03:58] written
[1:04:00] with a pen of iron
[1:04:03] and with the point of a diamond.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; It is engraved upon the table of their
[1:04:15] heart.
[1:04:16] So God is also using an iron pen to
[1:04:20] write on on the heart of the people.
[1:04:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; So when Paul says we are a written
[1:04:29] episode
[1:04:31] read by all men and he make us to know
[1:04:34] there in his writing that uh the you
[1:04:37] know that that the episode is written
[1:04:39] upon our heart is also written with an
[1:04:42] iron pen. we will get to death, not to
[1:04:45] die. But he says here, the sin of Judah
[1:04:49] is written with a pen
[1:04:52] uh of iron and uh uh with the point of a
[1:04:57] diamond. It is engraved upon the table
[1:05:01] of their heart and upon the horns of
[1:05:05] their altar.
[1:05:06] Praise the Lord. which the children
[1:05:09] remember their altar and their growth by
[1:05:13] the green tree upon the high hills.
[1:05:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what what is happening here is
[1:05:23] that the people have indulged themselves
[1:05:27] into lot of idolatry. Let's go to
[1:05:30] Jeremiah chapter 7. Let's go to Jeremiah
[1:05:34] chapter 7.
[1:05:36] Praise the Lord. Jeremiah chapter 7
[1:05:38] verse one. The word of the Lord came to
[1:05:41] Jeremiah the the the word that came to
[1:05:44] Jeremiah from the Lord saying stand in
[1:05:48] the gate of the Lord's house and
[1:05:51] proclaim there this word and say the
[1:05:55] word of the Lord all ye Judah that enter
[1:06:00] in at these gates or to worship the
[1:06:03] Lord. Thus say the Lord of hosts, the
[1:06:06] God of Israel, I meant your ways and
[1:06:09] your doing, and I will cause you to
[1:06:12] dwell in this place. Trust not, trust ye
[1:06:16] not in lying words, saying the temple of
[1:06:20] the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the
[1:06:22] temple of the Lord.
[1:06:25] These these are these. For if ye uh
[1:06:29] thoroughly amend your ways and your
[1:06:31] doing, if you thoroughly execute
[1:06:34] judgment between the man and his
[1:06:36] neighbor, uh if if ye oppress not the
[1:06:40] stranger, the fatherless, the widows,
[1:06:42] and you go on and on and on and on. Now,
[1:06:45] what is happening here? Uh uh uh uh let
[1:06:48] me go a little bit again. Then I will
[1:06:50] cause verse seven. Then I will cause you
[1:06:53] to dw in this place in the land that I
[1:06:56] gave to your fathers forever. And
[1:06:58] behold, ye trust in lying words that
[1:07:02] cannot profit. Will you will ye steal
[1:07:06] murder, commit adultery, swear falsely
[1:07:09] burn incense onto B, and walk after
[1:07:12] other gods whom you know not? Yet you
[1:07:15] are saying the temple of the Lord. We
[1:07:17] have the temple of the Lord. What was
[1:07:19] happening here is that the people were
[1:07:22] indulging into idolatry but yet they had
[1:07:26] they they were very comfortable to go to
[1:07:29] the house of the Lord and claim that uh
[1:07:32] they were they were believing people.
[1:07:34] They were people that were believing in
[1:07:36] God and because they think that okay we
[1:07:39] have a temple down there. I go to the
[1:07:41] temple I do my duties. I pay my my my my
[1:07:45] tithe and whatever it is. But yet when
[1:07:48] when they get out of the temple and go
[1:07:50] to their home, they are setting up
[1:07:53] different forms of idols.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; They are setting up different forms of
[1:07:59] idols.
[1:08:01] Are we together?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] Now, the reason that that that kind of
[1:08:09] drew me in this, like like I was just
[1:08:11] telling you, now I'm studying all of
[1:08:12] this uh uh uh uh pick up your pen, the
[1:08:15] right thing, and then I get into this uh
[1:08:18] uh uh uh iron pen. And then I'm
[1:08:21] realizing that God is is dealing with
[1:08:24] Israel on their idolatry. So, I go back
[1:08:27] a little bit to be able to get uh uh uh
[1:08:30] a little history to what I'm reading.
[1:08:32] But then I realized that as God is
[1:08:36] dealing with these people uh you will
[1:08:38] see chapter 7, chapter 8, chapter 9 and
[1:08:43] chapter 10. Now chapter 10
[1:08:48] caught my attention
[1:08:51] because in chapter 10, if you go to
[1:08:53] chapter 10, you will see
[1:08:57] uh
[1:08:58] oh Lord help me this morning. Amen.
[1:09:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; You had you had breakfast this morning.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; I never I never had none. So I can I can
[1:09:14] feed on your energy. Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Now, so in chapter 10,
[1:09:23] in chapter 10, watch this now. In
[1:09:26] chapter 10, let's read from verse one.
[1:09:29] Yeah. Yeah. the words which the laws
[1:09:32] speak unto you, oh house of Israel, for
[1:09:37] thus said the Lord, learn not the ways
[1:09:40] of the hidden.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; What was the ways of the healing?
[1:09:44] Idolatry.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Learn not the ways of the hidden.
[1:09:51] And be not dismayed at the signs of
[1:09:56] heaven.
[1:09:57] For the heathen are dismayed are dim.
[1:10:01] For the custom of the people are vain.
[1:10:05] For one cut a tree out of the forest
[1:10:10] and and and work
[1:10:13] the work of the hand of the workman with
[1:10:16] axe. They deck it with silver and gold
[1:10:19] and fasting it. Now, if you if you read
[1:10:23] down here and you are you are a a Bible
[1:10:27] student, let me not just say Bible
[1:10:29] readm. If you're a Bible student, you
[1:10:31] will you'll realize that this chapter
[1:10:34] and this verse is the verse that have
[1:10:37] long been associated to Christmas tree.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; It have long been associated to
[1:10:47] Christmas tree.
[1:10:49] That's the reason why Christian f at
[1:10:52] Christmas tree but was God talking about
[1:10:55] Christmas tree
[1:10:59] and I don't think he was talking about
[1:11:00] Christmas tree he was talking because
[1:11:03] it's not only Christmas tree that is
[1:11:05] that that is idolatry
[1:11:09] it's anything that we put first in our
[1:11:12] life anything we are putting before our
[1:11:14] prayer life anything we are putting
[1:11:16] before our devotion Our obedience to
[1:11:19] God's word is an idolatry.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; It's not only a Christmas tree.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Now, here is the thing now that like I
[1:11:26] said I that was going to shock you
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; because
[1:11:33] brother Brandon will read from this
[1:11:36] particular book of the Bible. He would
[1:11:39] read from this particular chapter of the
[1:11:41] Bible. He will preach a message
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; and he will say not one thing about
[1:11:47] Christmas tree.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Here's the most thing that will shock
[1:11:56] you. Are you ready?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the Lord Jesus.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:07] You realize there are there are some
[1:12:08] things that uh and and that is and that
[1:12:11] is the way I am. If I really don't study
[1:12:14] something, I don't preach about it.
[1:12:17] And I will promise you that I've never
[1:12:18] preached about Christmas tree over this
[1:12:20] movie.
[1:12:22] So you cannot tell me you know my
[1:12:24] position on Christmas tree
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; because I've never preach it.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; I've never preach it.
[1:12:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:37] So whatever whatever position you have,
[1:12:40] I was not the one you got it from.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Now this is what will shock you. Let's
[1:12:51] let's let's go ahead and study together.
[1:12:54] You love the Lord.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Are you worried this morning?
[1:13:04] If you get your Christmas tree up or you
[1:13:05] think I'm coming to bring it down,
[1:13:09] praise the Lord. Glory be to God.
[1:13:13] Let's let's just enjoy the Lord. Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Let's just enjoy the Lord. There are
[1:13:17] there are better things to preach about
[1:13:19] than for me to come and spend all my
[1:13:21] time preaching on Christmas tree this
[1:13:22] morning.
[1:13:24] Okay, let's this is what I want to bring
[1:13:26] to you in the message, the sign of his
[1:13:30] coming. That was the message brother
[1:13:32] Brandon preached
[1:13:36] uh where he read from Jeremiah chapter
[1:13:38] 10. He read from Jeremiah chapter 10. He
[1:13:43] read verse one and verse two
[1:13:48] and he went on and preach his message.
[1:13:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; This is the prophet of God. This is the
[1:13:56] man that God has given the mis h the
[1:14:00] responsibility to to tie all the loose
[1:14:02] ends.
[1:14:04] All the things that we believe are
[1:14:06] mysterious in the scripture. He was
[1:14:09] giving the the the ability the
[1:14:11] commission he fulfillment of revelation
[1:14:13] 107 to tie the loose ends.
[1:14:18] Praise the lord.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now there's a reason why I'm going
[1:14:22] down this road. So you just you just
[1:14:24] hold tight now. So he's saying this,
[1:14:27] listen now. About six weeks ago, one
[1:14:31] morning I guess
[1:14:34] I was on the road to Arizona
[1:14:37] with brother Softman and brother Wolves.
[1:14:41] Two of the trustees of the church at the
[1:14:44] tabernacle at Jeffersonville.
[1:14:47] He was on the road. They were traveling.
[1:14:49] He says, "And I saw a vision of a
[1:14:51] strange thing.
[1:14:54] There were two men
[1:14:56] and and and they were both kind of a
[1:14:59] well trim trim up men and they were both
[1:15:03] kind of fighters.
[1:15:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Now, this message was preached on April
[1:15:14] 6.
[1:15:16] He's saying six weeks ago before April
[1:15:20] 6.
[1:15:22] Praise the Lord. I want you to put put
[1:15:25] all that you you mathematician you can
[1:15:28] do the calculation and just and just let
[1:15:30] us know when when we need it. Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; This is two men that you know uh they
[1:15:36] were kind of a fighter. They they they
[1:15:39] had on regular clothes but they were
[1:15:42] kind of real fighters. They they they
[1:15:45] they wanted to fight and they had a
[1:15:48] grudge against each other
[1:15:52] and one of them now he's having a vision
[1:15:55] he don't know these people they are
[1:15:58] traveling on a trip and he breaks into a
[1:16:00] vision this was something that was very
[1:16:04] common for brother Brandon praise the
[1:16:06] Lord
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; people around him will say that he will
[1:16:10] always he was he was somebody that have
[1:16:13] a good sense of human
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; and he and and and he loved joking
[1:16:19] because it helps him to get away from
[1:16:22] vision.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; That was his way to get away from
[1:16:27] vision.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; He said something at the beginning of
[1:16:30] this message. I laughed so high
[1:16:32] yesterday. I said, "Oh my god, where did
[1:16:35] the man take this thing from?"
[1:16:38] But I I'll keep that for another day.
[1:16:40] Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; I'll keep that. I don't want to get out
[1:16:42] of place. So, so yeah, he's having a
[1:16:44] vision and and and and he going on here.
[1:16:47] They did got into it. The both men got
[1:16:50] into it. It looks like it was in New
[1:16:53] York. I could see myself coming there
[1:16:56] towards the arena. He's in a vision.
[1:16:59] He's seeing the two men h are going to
[1:17:02] fight or they are fighting and in a
[1:17:04] vision he's coming to the arena to see
[1:17:06] what is happening. Are we together?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] I I I was kind of studying the message
[1:17:15] that I entitled preaching by vision. So
[1:17:19] I'm hope I can I can I can share that
[1:17:21] with you sometime in the future. The uh
[1:17:25] uh I could see myself coming down there
[1:17:28] towards the arena and so for where I
[1:17:30] preach so much which mean he have had
[1:17:34] service in that arena in New York where
[1:17:38] this fight was taking place.
[1:17:43] And I looked it and looked like there
[1:17:46] was a little hole
[1:17:49] around
[1:17:50] a little hole round place like this of a
[1:17:54] place they had got into
[1:17:57] and they started fighting and one killed
[1:18:01] the other
[1:18:04] and I seen it looks like something dim
[1:18:08] or water and And they had looked like uh
[1:18:13] uh
[1:18:15] a a cellophane something that that was
[1:18:19] put over one fist. So it looks like in a
[1:18:23] vision they were fighting one of the men
[1:18:25] killed his friend and now he's seeing
[1:18:27] them coming to cover the body. That's
[1:18:30] what he's describing now in a vision.
[1:18:35] Everything got real quiet and it was
[1:18:38] sad.
[1:18:41] They did kill one, I killed the other
[1:18:43] one
[1:18:45] in the field. And I thought, well, I
[1:18:49] don't know exactly what that means,
[1:18:52] Lord. I just kind of jot it down. He's
[1:18:57] driving in a car. He's in this vision
[1:19:01] and he's seeing it. He cannot identify
[1:19:04] the people in the vision, but he just
[1:19:06] wrote it down. I don't know what it
[1:19:09] means, but he just wrote it down in and
[1:19:12] the brothers, they in the crowd, you
[1:19:14] know, maybe they're talking something.
[1:19:15] They don't know he's having a vision,
[1:19:16] but he's having a vision. He wrote it
[1:19:18] down.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord.
[1:19:24] You You all know what taking place the
[1:19:27] other day.
[1:19:30] Two uh witherw fighters in New York
[1:19:34] fighting out and one kill.
[1:19:38] kill the other one, you see.
[1:19:41] And he is really good. He's talking
[1:19:45] about God
[1:19:47] now. So, Brother Brandham is saying that
[1:19:49] uh you heard it on the news because as
[1:19:52] you as we read down here, he did not
[1:19:54] know that this happened and and this
[1:19:58] thing happened two days before he's
[1:20:00] preaching this message. Okay.
[1:20:08] He says he's and he he is really good
[1:20:12] isn't he letting us know these things
[1:20:15] because their reason I didn't I I didn't
[1:20:20] uh uh it didn't look like pertaining to
[1:20:22] the church. So, I just let it go.
[1:20:27] And uh uh a while ago, I never learned
[1:20:30] of it till just a while ago, I was
[1:20:34] thinking, "Yes, yes, sir." And I got
[1:20:36] that wrote down in my little boat. You
[1:20:39] see, I didn't know what it was. It seems
[1:20:44] like I stepped down uh that hole like
[1:20:49] that uh went in in the place. um was was
[1:20:55] the ring they were in and they were
[1:20:58] fighting in fuel and one killed the
[1:21:00] other.
[1:21:02] So another field both in the same uh
[1:21:06] then he start talking you know when when
[1:21:08] whenas
[1:21:10] will start taking one another live then
[1:21:12] is not worth it. Amen.
[1:21:14] And he says uh that's the same like king
[1:21:17] Cain and and Abel say king and Abel fell
[1:21:19] you see uh uh there to see brothers
[1:21:23] brother kill brother
[1:21:27] now so
[1:21:30] but we are so glad that we are trying to
[1:21:33] restore brothers back. Amen. Not to kill
[1:21:36] brothers but we restore brothers back to
[1:21:38] the faith once the faith that is once
[1:21:39] delivered to the saints. Now here is the
[1:21:42] thing. Here is the thing now.
[1:21:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] That it will please the Lord. I put up
[1:21:52] my pictures. Put up my pictures. I love
[1:21:56] these things because as I was as I was
[1:21:58] studying, I decided to go back since uh
[1:22:03] uh uh uh intelligence. Put up the first
[1:22:06] two pictures. That was the fight. That
[1:22:09] was the fight.
[1:22:11] This is uh uh
[1:22:16] uh where is the young man name?
[1:22:21] One of them is called uh Benny the Kate.
[1:22:26] This is Benny the Kate. He was the one
[1:22:27] that got killed in the fight. And the
[1:22:30] next picture.
[1:22:37] Okay. And this is uh uh Emry Griffin.
[1:22:44] So it was Benny and uh and and Emmy that
[1:22:48] fight. Uh so when brother Brandham
[1:22:50] shared this apostle t I went on Google I
[1:22:54] said 1964 two boxers fight in New York
[1:22:58] and one got killed and they brought me
[1:22:59] the information.
[1:23:02] So I he says, "Okay, I'll look for some
[1:23:04] pictures so I can I can bring I'm a news
[1:23:07] reporter." Okay, I'm a news reporter. So
[1:23:10] I'm trying to carry you back 1964
[1:23:14] so you can uh have a picture of what
[1:23:18] happened. Praise the Lord. He never gave
[1:23:20] us the main name, but if there were two
[1:23:23] boxers that fought and one killed, that
[1:23:25] was international news. That was n
[1:23:28] international news. So definitely there
[1:23:30] should be some information about it. So
[1:23:32] I decided I will for for the benefit of
[1:23:35] the doubt I'll bring you more
[1:23:36] information. So uh so you will know that
[1:23:40] our news report is is verified. Amen.
[1:23:45] We don't need to bring you a picture
[1:23:46] when the prophet said it but uh I think
[1:23:49] it will help you. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; It will help you so you can be able to
[1:23:53] grab what I'm talking about. Uh uh so
[1:23:57] said that that uh brother Brandham
[1:24:02] is having a vision. He says he said
[1:24:04] this. He said it never concerned the
[1:24:06] church. That that was the same word. He
[1:24:09] had a vision concerning uh uh uh what's
[1:24:11] the lady name? Uh Miriam Merald. What's
[1:24:14] her name?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He had a vision concerning her.
[1:24:19] And he says uh they say she died of
[1:24:21] suicide. He said no that's lie. She died
[1:24:24] of heart attack because I saw her in a
[1:24:26] vision.
[1:24:31] Until now it's recorded that she died of
[1:24:34] sweat.
[1:24:36] I wish they will believe the prophet
[1:24:38] report.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; I believe I wish they will believe.
[1:24:44] That's brother Brandham telling us a
[1:24:45] vision six weeks that he saw
[1:24:50] before these two men will get in the
[1:24:52] fight and one will kill the other. It
[1:24:55] does not have anything to do with
[1:24:57] salvation. It does not have anything to
[1:25:00] do with repentance. This uh this man uh
[1:25:03] the one that that that killed a friend
[1:25:05] might have never heard about brother
[1:25:06] Brandham. He might have never even heard
[1:25:09] that brother Brandham had a vision.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But now see the
[1:25:14] contrast. Here is brother Brandon
[1:25:16] PREACHING FROM JEREMIAH chapter 10
[1:25:20] THAT HAVE BEEN PREACHED OVER AND OVER
[1:25:23] and we have established a doctrine
[1:25:27] that says that the Bible says it's wrong
[1:25:30] to have Christmas tree straight. And I'm
[1:25:32] not even saying it's right.
[1:25:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to to to to to
[1:25:40] come to a balance this morning. But
[1:25:42] there is something I'm trying to bring
[1:25:44] here. How that is the way that we can
[1:25:49] make a doctrine an idol because we have
[1:25:53] make it an idol.
[1:25:55] Now here is Jeremiah talking about the
[1:25:57] people cutting down trees and fashioning
[1:26:01] it. Do you know that this wool is a tree
[1:26:04] that has been fashioned
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; and we can design it and put flowers on
[1:26:10] it? And how do we call it? Sacred.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; We call it sacra. This is the sacred.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Is it is it a deck THAT IS SACRED OR THE
[1:26:23] WORD THAT IS PREACHED FROM THE DECKS?
[1:26:30] Are you seeing where I'm going?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; How we form idol?
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; WE WILL WE WILL DISREGARD the word of
[1:26:37] God, but yet we say it's A SACRED DESK.
[1:26:40] NOBODY IS QUALIFIED TO GO BEHIND the
[1:26:43] sacred desk until he meet the pillar of
[1:26:45] fire where
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; are you understanding what I'm saying?
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; This piano, this this thing here is a
[1:27:00] wood.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I wish I could play.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:10] Man praying for the day where the
[1:27:13] anointing would drop.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Now this is made out of a wood
[1:27:21] is being deck designed fist very well
[1:27:28] and we can also make an idol out of it.
[1:27:34] We can also YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
[1:27:37] JEREMIAH WAS DEALING WITH THE idolatry
[1:27:42] that was havoc in the hearts of the
[1:27:44] people.
[1:27:47] BUT HE'S SAYING THAT GOD IS EVEN WRITING
[1:27:50] WITH AN iron pen
[1:27:54] describing the idolatry that the people
[1:27:57] has har in their heart.
[1:28:03] So is Christmas tree the only idolatry?
[1:28:06] Let me I will tell you what what we have
[1:28:09] done with that.
[1:28:12] I'll tell you what we have done with
[1:28:14] that.
[1:28:16] What actually we have done is that
[1:28:20] we have used that
[1:28:25] to to abuse our mind and and and that is
[1:28:29] some of the reason why the church
[1:28:33] is very poor in giving.
[1:28:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; I will explain myself.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; I will explain myself. You just sit
[1:28:44] tight
[1:28:47] because
[1:28:50] Christmas we know there is nothing
[1:28:54] truth to the myth of Christmas.
[1:28:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; But yet a prophet would tell us THAT NO
[1:29:03] MATTER WHAT THE DATE IS, I just read
[1:29:07] some things to you here this morning. He
[1:29:10] says he says a divine healing. He says
[1:29:14] and the fact
[1:29:16] of all the error and everything there is
[1:29:19] about it talking about Christmas there
[1:29:22] is there is something about it that the
[1:29:25] word tried to make it an Xmas you know
[1:29:29] and but God still got a Christmas
[1:29:34] in it somewhere
[1:29:38] hasn't he
[1:29:40] sure has he has got something about it.
[1:29:44] Just the very name and the thought of
[1:29:48] the birth of the Lord Jesus.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; JUST THE VERY NAME FOR THE FATHER IS
[1:29:57] ASSOCIATED WITH THE BIRTH OF JESUS. AND
[1:30:00] WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT COMES TO
[1:30:02] YOUR MIND? FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORD
[1:30:06] THAT HE GAVE.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. AND IF YOU DON'T
[1:30:11] GET THE REVELATION OF CHRISTMAS, YOU
[1:30:13] WILL NEVER GET THE GOOD sense of giving.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; That's what Christmas is all about. God
[1:30:21] gave so we can learn to give.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE ABUSED CHRISTMAS in
[1:30:31] a religious way,
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; we don't have no true sense of giving.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; We don't have no true sense of giving.
[1:30:40] I will tell you which of course is a
[1:30:43] fact. You can you can prove it anyway.
[1:30:45] You will realize that around around the
[1:30:48] church you will find out that uh uh uh
[1:30:53] because of the principle of tithing.
[1:30:57] You'll find out that uh in the church
[1:31:00] finance there is more tithe than there
[1:31:02] is offering.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's a teaching for
[1:31:10] another day
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; because t is not just about money.
[1:31:14] No, it's a covenant.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; It's not just about money.
[1:31:19] But it's BECAUSE OF THIS WHOLE concept
[1:31:23] of giving. And one of the THING THAT
[1:31:26] HAVE DESTROYED THAT CONCEPT is our lying
[1:31:29] teaching about Christmas.
[1:31:33] WE HAVE PILED ON ALL THE CONTRARY QUOTES
[1:31:36] ABOUT Christmas and found nothing good
[1:31:38] about it.
[1:31:44] IF WE SAY GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE
[1:31:46] GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, Christmas is
[1:31:50] about the day that the son was giving.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:08] And as much as we don't believe in
[1:32:10] Christmas, we still look for a Christmas
[1:32:13] card. We still hope that somebody can
[1:32:15] send us a card.
[1:32:18] I never got nothing for this Christmas.
[1:32:21] We say honor our breath because we don't
[1:32:25] want anybody to believe that we believe
[1:32:26] in Christmas.
[1:32:32] And we have also make that an idolatry.
[1:32:36] Thinking that we are doing God a
[1:32:38] service,
[1:32:40] we have make that an idolatry.
[1:32:43] And because we have make it an idolatry,
[1:32:46] what God expect from us?
[1:32:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; The shepherds were told about his birth.
[1:32:56] They came down to to to the the the the
[1:32:59] the the
[1:33:02] manger where he was and they ran down
[1:33:05] there that I mean they were just on the
[1:33:07] field that night. They never had gifts
[1:33:09] in their hand but they sang songs to
[1:33:11] him. PRAISE THE LORD. THE WISE MEN WERE
[1:33:15] TOLD ABOUT HIS BIRTH. A SON ANNOUNCED
[1:33:18] HIS BIRTH IN HEAVEN. THEY FOLLOWED THAT
[1:33:20] SON. THEY GATHER GIFTS. THEY BROUGHT
[1:33:22] GIFTS TO HIM. That's what Christmas is
[1:33:25] about. God giving you gift and you also
[1:33:30] giving the Lord gift and giving the ones
[1:33:34] around you gift.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; But because of the myth of doctrine and
[1:33:47] teachings that we have we have
[1:33:49] formulated for ourself, we have abused
[1:33:52] ourself of death.
[1:33:54] Because we don't want to be found guilty
[1:33:57] of celebrating Christmas and yet we
[1:34:00] celebrate it. It's an adole in our
[1:34:02] heart.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; I mean, are you so shocked? Are you so
[1:34:16] quiet?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; You were not expecting it.
[1:34:23] You thought I was going to nail
[1:34:24] Christmas tree.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It's not only a Christmas tree that is
[1:34:29] made out of wood. This poopy is made out
[1:34:32] of wood.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; The piano is made out of wood.
[1:34:38] When we only limit worship to the sound
[1:34:40] of a piano and we cannot lift our voice
[1:34:43] and sing and praise God, we are making
[1:34:45] the piano an idol. That if the piano
[1:34:48] don't sound, we will not praise God.
[1:34:51] So you're making this wood
[1:34:54] that they put some belts in. You're
[1:34:56] making it an idol.
[1:34:59] Oh yeah. The guitar also is made out of
[1:35:01] wood. I think so.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; I don't think they're plastic.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. With some strings on
[1:35:08] it.
[1:35:10] And we must only hear the sound of a
[1:35:12] guitar before we can we can sing. Then
[1:35:14] you're making it an idol.
[1:35:24] AND THAT WAS AND THAT WAS THE thing that
[1:35:27] JUDAH WAS CAPTURING. THAT WAS THE THING
[1:35:30] THAT THEY WERE TRAPPED IN. THAT WAS THE
[1:35:33] THING THAT GOD WAS REBUKING IN THE BOOK
[1:35:35] OF JEREMIAH. THE IDOL TRAIN THAT HAD
[1:35:39] CAUGHT THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE. BUT YET
[1:35:41] THESE WERE PEOPLE THAT WAS SHOUTING THE
[1:35:43] TEMPLE OF THE LORD. THE TEMPLE OF THE
[1:35:45] LORD. I'M IDENTIFIED WITH THE TEMPLE. I
[1:35:47] GOES TO THE TABERNACLE. I'M IN THE
[1:35:49] MESSAGE.
[1:35:51] But yet their hearts were full of idol.
[1:35:59] They idolize things.
[1:36:02] They idolize men. They idolize
[1:36:04] substance.
[1:36:08] And it stop them from bringing true
[1:36:11] worship to God.
[1:36:16] It stopped them from bringing true
[1:36:18] worship to God.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; I told you another time I says when you
[1:36:29] when you look at the you look at the the
[1:36:31] scripture for God so loved the word that
[1:36:33] he gave. That's the meaning of agapo.
[1:36:36] Agapo gave filot takes.
[1:36:40] With filio love we just won. We won. We
[1:36:43] won. We want
[1:36:46] but I got gifts.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; GOD FIRST EXPRESSION
[1:36:56] THAT HE GAVE himself when he was COMING
[1:36:59] FROM THE INTERNAL SPIRIT TO EVEN BEGIN
[1:37:02] TIME. HE GOT A CONDESCEND. HE CONDEMNED
[1:37:05] HIMSELF CALLED THE LONGEST AND HE GAVE
[1:37:08] HIMSELF.
[1:37:10] He's always giving.
[1:37:13] He's always giving.
[1:37:17] There's a there's a there's a old song
[1:37:20] that says you can never beat God in
[1:37:22] giving.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; No matter how hard you try, the more you
[1:37:27] give, the more he give back to you.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; You can never beat him in giving because
[1:37:34] that's his nature. He gives. And you see
[1:37:38] that it's is becoming a poor culture
[1:37:42] among us
[1:37:44] that that we are not we are not even
[1:37:47] thinking about it that we're not even
[1:37:48] teaching our children to give. I
[1:37:51] remember being small when we go in the
[1:37:53] church, you know, uh uh uh the parents
[1:37:56] will make sure that the first thing
[1:37:57] before you, hey, come here, come here.
[1:37:59] They will tell you
[1:38:01] that your offering when you go pay your
[1:38:03] offering and then pay my own offering.
[1:38:05] They can't go to church, but they will
[1:38:06] give you offering so you can pay for
[1:38:08] them. Pay my offering. Oh, how what
[1:38:12] about God I used to be. I'll eat that
[1:38:14] offering. I split it in two.
[1:38:17] Praise. Praise the Lord. I hate love,
[1:38:21] God money. God have mercy on me.
[1:38:25] Praise
[1:38:27] praise the Lord.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; And
[1:38:33] and sometimes too is is really because I
[1:38:36] wanted to buy some uh some donuts or so.
[1:38:39] That's why I would really get ready for
[1:38:40] church because I know they're going to
[1:38:41] give me offering.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:48] You see, but that poor culture,
[1:38:53] that poor culture, because that's how
[1:38:55] you have to understand God associating
[1:38:59] with you. He gave himself.
[1:39:04] He gave himself. It's a revelation.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:14] It's not for what what the the
[1:39:16] commercial word is making Christmas all
[1:39:18] about. No,
[1:39:21] that's not what it is. But you see, we
[1:39:24] have jump on the wrong train and it has
[1:39:28] affected us.
[1:39:30] It has affected us.
[1:39:34] It has affected us.
[1:39:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:40] that he has robbed us of death.
[1:39:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:53] That's such a time of the of of the year
[1:39:56] where the word try to practice a little
[1:39:58] sense of giving. It's not in us. Why?
[1:40:02] Because we make it I don't believe
[1:40:04] Christmas.
[1:40:07] Yeah. We we say I don't believe
[1:40:08] Christmas. I don't I don't we don't
[1:40:09] believe Christmas. We don't celebrate
[1:40:11] Christmas, you know. Uh so we we just we
[1:40:13] just take it from our mind.
[1:40:20] But is that the word? Is that the
[1:40:21] message of the hour?
[1:40:24] Amen.
[1:40:26] Is that the message of the hour?
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:33] Well, sorry if that I'm not preaching
[1:40:36] what you expect this morning, but I not
[1:40:38] even got to my message yet.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, brother Brown. Right
[1:40:42] here in uh in uh uh
[1:40:47] God wrapped gift, he says. And then I
[1:40:50] want to take the time to the time to
[1:40:52] express to each and every one of you how
[1:40:55] grateful I am to you for your Christmas
[1:40:58] cards and gifts and things that you
[1:41:01] receive. uh uh and things that was
[1:41:04] received at our house. I certainly thank
[1:41:06] you with all my heart. I certain I it
[1:41:09] certainly did us good this morning. I
[1:41:12] got a little bored small enough yet to
[1:41:16] kind of want a Christmas tree and uh we
[1:41:19] had it in the room and this morning go
[1:41:22] on there. I found several gifts from my
[1:41:26] church year and from my friends around
[1:41:30] different places that had come laying
[1:41:33] under the tree and I don't have words to
[1:41:36] express to you how I appreciate everyone
[1:41:40] of them.
[1:41:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:50] Now you see there there there are places
[1:41:53] where we can we can we can become you
[1:41:56] know we can we can take uh uh uh you
[1:42:01] know uh
[1:42:03] a trade and and and ride on certain
[1:42:05] things you know to be able to to promote
[1:42:10] uh uh you know our our belief and our
[1:42:14] conviction in in everything.
[1:42:17] But uh what I'm trying to bring to you
[1:42:19] this morning
[1:42:21] uh
[1:42:23] I'm not I'm not uh you know I don't I
[1:42:26] don't have a factory. I'm not working
[1:42:27] with no company. So I'm not selling
[1:42:29] Christmas tree.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; So don't think that I'm I'm trying to
[1:42:33] promote you to come and buy Christmas
[1:42:34] tree. I don't I'm not selling it.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to bring us a balance to
[1:42:41] our mind.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:44] I'm just trying to bring a balance and
[1:42:47] uh and the most that I'm trying to do
[1:42:50] this morning is to see is to help us see
[1:42:54] how we have abused our mind and we have
[1:42:57] put ourself into a very poor culture.
[1:43:03] We have put oursel into a very poor
[1:43:05] culture that the real true sense of
[1:43:08] giving is not among us.
[1:43:12] We do a more of obligation
[1:43:21] than of cheerfulness.
[1:43:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; It's written, it's written there in the
[1:43:28] message and brother Brandon will say
[1:43:30] over and over. Giving is part of our
[1:43:32] worship.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; He said it's part of our service.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; It's part of our service. But are we
[1:43:40] teaching our children that?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Are we teaching them that? Oh, it's so
[1:43:47] easy for you to say, "Well, now we in a
[1:43:49] cashless society." I mean, I So, so what
[1:43:53] what what you're doing is that uh uh uh
[1:43:56] they are not taught that. So when they
[1:43:59] ever get to the place of where now they
[1:44:01] can own their own money, they don't have
[1:44:04] it in them
[1:44:07] because it's not part of their
[1:44:08] education.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; What you telling them is that uh I'm
[1:44:17] working so I'm the only person that can
[1:44:18] pay offering. You're not working yet. So
[1:44:20] find your own money.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; When you start working then you you
[1:44:24] start paying offering.
[1:44:29] Are we together?
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you seeing Are you seeing
[1:44:35] where I'm going with this? Praise the
[1:44:37] Lord.
[1:44:46] Our
[1:44:54] eyes have seen his time and we have come
[1:44:58] to worship him. That was the confession
[1:45:01] of the wise men. We have seen his time.
[1:45:05] We have seen the revelation
[1:45:09] that this is the star of Judah.
[1:45:12] We have seen the fulfillment of Bam
[1:45:15] prophecy. A star will rise out of Judah.
[1:45:19] We have seen his star and we have come
[1:45:21] to worship him. And brother Brandham
[1:45:23] says their gift
[1:45:27] shows the revelation of what they
[1:45:29] thought of him.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; The star when they saw the star, the
[1:45:35] star uh it was just a star, a
[1:45:38] constellation of star. But the
[1:45:41] revelation that they received from that
[1:45:43] star
[1:45:45] fashion their heart that they were not
[1:45:47] capping after one another. No, this one
[1:45:50] says, "I believe THAT HE'S A KING. HE
[1:45:52] GOT HIM GOLD."
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; THE OTHER ONE GOT HIM FRANK INCENSE.
[1:46:03] Because of his service, worship.
[1:46:07] The other one got him a gift that speaks
[1:46:10] of his death.
[1:46:13] THEIR REVELATION FROM THE STAR PREPARED
[1:46:15] THEIR HEARTS
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; to give
[1:46:18] to what God has given to them.
[1:46:28] And it was Christmas.
[1:46:31] It was Christmas
[1:46:34] because the star appeared at his birth.
[1:46:39] So it was Christmas. It was their
[1:46:41] attitude to Christmas to bring gift.
[1:46:50] We get on this train where we just use
[1:46:52] it just to insult.
[1:46:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:59] But yet
[1:47:02] we go to Walmart and buy our little idol
[1:47:04] and put it on our arm. Nobody must see
[1:47:06] this my Christmas gift.
[1:47:09] I nobody buy me anything for Christmas.
[1:47:11] I buy my own said Christmas gift and
[1:47:13] then we come right in our house and lock
[1:47:16] the door and and open. Oh, at least I
[1:47:18] got something for myself for Christmas.
[1:47:21] Christmas.
[1:47:28] THAT'S WHAT JEREMIAH WAS REBUKING THE
[1:47:30] PEOPLE FOR. The idols they had in their
[1:47:33] home, THE IDOLS IN THEIR COVERS, THE
[1:47:36] IDOLS THEY WERE KEEPING AND YET CLAIMING
[1:47:38] to be people of the tabernacle
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; when it's something
[1:47:50] a period of time where uh uh uh we must
[1:47:54] show some sense of cheerfulness,
[1:47:58] some sense of gratitude.
[1:48:01] Yeah, NO MATTER IT'S NOT A PRICE TAG. NO
[1:48:04] MATTER WHAT IS WHAT IS WRAPPED AND
[1:48:06] BROTHER B WILL EVEN PREACH TO US GOD'S
[1:48:09] WRAPPED GIFT
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WRAP HIMSELF IN FLESH AND GIVE
[1:48:16] to us.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; If God will give us gift on Christmas,
[1:48:22] what is wrong for you to give somebody
[1:48:23] something?
[1:48:27] What is wrong for you to wrap a a
[1:48:32] an old shoes and give it to somebody?
[1:48:43] We build
[1:48:45] our own idols
[1:48:48] and we think that we are bringing God
[1:48:51] pleasure.
[1:48:53] We think we are making God happy
[1:48:56] because we are not like the heathens.
[1:48:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; We don't have Christmas tree
[1:49:06] but yet we have LED lights
[1:49:10] that are shooting different colors.
[1:49:14] Praise the Lord. No, we're not calling
[1:49:16] Christmas light. They are not Christmas
[1:49:17] light because we don't believe in
[1:49:18] Christmas. So they are LED light.
[1:49:30] God told the children of Israel, "Have
[1:49:32] no other God
[1:49:35] before me."
[1:49:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:40] Amen.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Have no other God before me. YOU MEAN
[1:49:44] GOD GOD WAS SO STRONG ON IDOLATRY UNTIL
[1:49:48] HE NEVER WANTED the people to even have
[1:49:50] a picture.
[1:49:53] A picture.
[1:49:56] Amen. When the Bible says don't have no
[1:49:59] similitudes,
[1:50:02] anything that looks like,
[1:50:06] praise the Lord. I want YOU TO HAVE THE
[1:50:09] REALITY. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE
[1:50:10] SOMETHING THAT LOOK LIKE THE PILLAR OF
[1:50:13] FIRE. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE SOMETHING
[1:50:15] THAT LOOK LIKE THE PILLOW OF CLOUD. I
[1:50:17] WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE THE PILLOW OF
[1:50:19] CLOUD. I WANT YOU TO GO IN HIS PRESENCE.
[1:50:22] COME OUT OF HIS PRESENCE.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; I want you to be limited to a picture.
[1:50:29] I want you to be to for you to
[1:50:31] experience God. Amen.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; He's more interested in us experiencing
[1:50:37] his presence,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; breathing his presence in and out,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; walking into it,
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; then doing everything that we have to do
[1:50:48] when we come into church. Then we just
[1:50:50] come so quietly
[1:50:57] because we entering the temple, the the
[1:51:00] house of God. The Bible say there must
[1:51:03] be silence.
[1:51:05] So we walking we're trying to be to us
[1:51:09] do we having reference now when there is
[1:51:12] no reference in our head
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; when there is no reference in our
[1:51:17] attitude.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:33] What are we talking about?
[1:51:38] I was I was just I was studying all of
[1:51:40] these things and I was just I I was just
[1:51:42] I was just I was just saying, Lord, I I
[1:51:44] I don't know what this thought is taking
[1:51:45] me to.
[1:51:47] I really don't know. But it was it was
[1:51:49] just before I left from here last night.
[1:51:51] It thought kind of a break to my heart.
[1:51:54] I said, "Okay, now I see what autobase
[1:51:57] is all about because I I don't I don't
[1:52:00] have time spending my my my you know my
[1:52:02] time on uh kind of uh you know uh uh
[1:52:06] preaching something because I want to be
[1:52:08] popular.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I for a long time I have believed
[1:52:16] that whether you have Christmas tree you
[1:52:17] don't it don't make no difference.
[1:52:20] You it don't make no difference. We all
[1:52:22] celebrate Christmas. It's just that we
[1:52:24] are hypocritical about it.
[1:52:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; The very same thing, you know, it's
[1:52:37] around the message cycle to take your
[1:52:39] phone and text somebody and say Merry
[1:52:41] Christmas, we got to take one quote of
[1:52:43] brother Brandham.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; We are not free to say Merry Christmas.
[1:52:51] But if we say brother Brandham quote
[1:52:54] this is not actually Christmas but I
[1:52:56] just want to say merry Christmas it's
[1:52:58] being hypocritical.
[1:53:02] It's not wrong to send brother Brandham
[1:53:04] quote but if you cannot say merry
[1:53:06] Christmas because you feel that it's an
[1:53:08] idle word
[1:53:10] but I can only say it because the
[1:53:12] prophet said it then is being
[1:53:14] hypocritical.
[1:53:16] It's being devilish.
[1:53:19] We are making an idol out of God's
[1:53:21] seven.
[1:53:31] And that's that's exactly what uh uh h
[1:53:34] Jeremiah is dealing here with.
[1:53:38] God had to use an iron pen to write on
[1:53:41] the hearts of the people. Why? Because
[1:53:44] idolatry has taken their heart. IDOLATRY
[1:53:47] HAS CONSUMED THEM. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW
[1:53:50] TO APPROACH GOD without an idol before
[1:53:53] it. They either make a man an idol, THEY
[1:53:56] MAKE A CHURCH AN IDOL, THEY MAKE A
[1:53:58] DOCTRINE AN IDOL. THEY CANNOT GO BEHIND
[1:54:01] THE VEIL themsel and LET THE CURTAIN
[1:54:04] DROP BEHIND THEM AND GET IN THE PRESENCE
[1:54:06] OF THE SHAKANA GLORY AND FEEL THE
[1:54:08] PRESENCE OF GOD.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; They got to use somebody as an idol.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:28] See what see what the dictionary said
[1:54:31] here as I was looking at this yesterday
[1:54:35] in the scripture. An iron pen symbolize
[1:54:38] permanence.
[1:54:41] WHEN JOB SAID A ALL MY WORDS could be
[1:54:44] written
[1:54:46] that it could BE WRITTEN WITH IRON PEN
[1:54:48] AND ENGRAVED in a rock.
[1:54:52] IT MEANS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS WRITTEN
[1:54:54] IT STICKS THERE. It cannot move.
[1:54:57] It means permanent.
[1:55:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; And you better know what you're writing
[1:55:02] on your heart with an iron pen. Because
[1:55:06] if you put an idol on your heart with an
[1:55:08] iron pen, it will not move. It was still
[1:55:10] there all the days of your life.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You worship an idol.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; You can never get to God until you get
[1:55:17] to God through somebody.
[1:55:22] Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; In the scripture, an iron pen symbolize
[1:55:28] permanence, deep inscription,
[1:55:36] unchanging authority,
[1:55:40] unchanging authority, something that
[1:55:43] cannot be changed. When you write it
[1:55:45] there, it cannot be changed.
[1:55:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:54] That's the reason why when Moses came
[1:55:56] down from the mountain with the
[1:55:58] commandment and saw the idolatrate of
[1:56:00] the people, he smash it on the ground.
[1:56:05] God had to rewrite
[1:56:09] because it was an unchanging writing.
[1:56:12] You cannot put it together. You can't
[1:56:14] mash it up again.
[1:56:17] He had to go back and God had to rewrite
[1:56:20] the commandment and give it to him a
[1:56:23] second time.
[1:56:26] And it was because of idols. It was
[1:56:29] because of idolatry.
[1:56:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, you you studied the message.
[1:56:37] When brother Brandon talks about
[1:56:39] Christmas, he blasted against the idol
[1:56:42] of Christmas and how they have
[1:56:44] commercialized it. Praise the Lord. AND
[1:56:47] HOW PEOPLE ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME TO
[1:56:50] BECOME ONE BETTER THAN THE OTHER. THAT'S
[1:56:52] NOT THE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS. IT MUST
[1:56:54] NOT make us better than the other. It
[1:56:55] must MAKE US TO GIVE OURSELF TO OTHERS.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Because someone gave himself to us.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW MUCH WE RECEIVE AND HOW
[1:57:06] MUCH GIFTS WE HAVE. IT'S HOW MUCH HAVE
[1:57:08] WE GIVEN.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; That's what Christmas is. Christmas is
[1:57:16] about giving people. It's about giving.
[1:57:19] Let's teach our heart to give.
[1:57:23] Give to the ones around us.
[1:57:26] Even give to strangers.
[1:57:30] We have abused ourself of of uh of uh of
[1:57:34] giving
[1:57:36] until even to help a poor stranger on
[1:57:38] the street, we got to stop being
[1:57:39] religious. Well, I don't want to give
[1:57:41] him money so he can't go smoke.
[1:57:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:49] The taxes that they taking from your
[1:57:51] money, they can tell you what to do with
[1:57:52] it.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The taxes that the
[1:57:56] government taking from your money, do
[1:57:57] they tell you what to do with it?
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, we it just it just put us to the
[1:58:03] place where we just become so poor in
[1:58:06] heart.
[1:58:12] learn about learn about brother
[1:58:13] Brandham. It would tell you that that
[1:58:15] brother Brandon was somebody that that
[1:58:18] that love tips.
[1:58:21] He gave general tips.
[1:58:27] The brother spoke about one time they
[1:58:29] were in a place and and this and this
[1:58:31] server was very you know she was very
[1:58:33] rude. She was so harsh and all of that.
[1:58:37] And at the end brother Brad give her a
[1:58:39] tip. The the brother asked brother
[1:58:40] Brandon he says why are you giving her
[1:58:42] such a tip? She her service was not
[1:58:44] good.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; But Brandon said maybe she had a bad
[1:58:47] day.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Maybe she's dealing with something.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; That was the kind of a man that will
[1:58:54] Brandon was.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Hope was dying. Charon Maru was dying.
[1:58:59] His boat was on the Ohio River rescuing
[1:59:03] people. He was giving his service.
[1:59:06] That's what Christmas is about.
[1:59:09] That's what Christ is about. That's what
[1:59:11] Christianity is all about.
[1:59:17] Giving ourself for others. Giving our
[1:59:19] service.
[1:59:28] What am I preaching this morning?
[1:59:31] Pick up your pen and write out going to
[1:59:33] my message here. But I just got stuck in
[1:59:36] this thought because I was telling on
[1:59:38] this iron pan and come down to reading
[1:59:41] about uh Judah and her idolatry. Get
[1:59:44] right in Jeremiah chapter 10. When I'm
[1:59:46] reading I said so this is the verse that
[1:59:48] we have used over the years to to create
[1:59:50] Christmas tree when it's not even
[1:59:52] talking about Christmas tree. Uh if
[1:59:54] Christmas tree Christmas tree is not the
[1:59:56] only idol that is de that is deck with
[1:59:58] God.
[2:00:11] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:15] Just one time uh you know a brother was
[2:00:19] driving with me and uh I had a I had a
[2:00:21] cross in my car and he asked me he said
[2:00:23] brother why you have that Catholic cross
[2:00:26] in your car. I said why make it
[2:00:27] Catholic? He said, "Because it say have
[2:00:29] Jesus on the on the cross."
[2:00:33] So I I told him, I says, "Sir,
[2:00:37] I I laugh in my head a little bit."
[2:00:41] I says, "Well, if you show somebody your
[2:00:44] baby picture, does that mean you stay
[2:00:46] baby?"
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you were working at
[2:00:53] uh uh Cup Food and you took a picture
[2:00:55] just to show that you were working at
[2:00:57] Cup Food and you show it to someone,
[2:00:59] does that mean that you are still
[2:01:00] working at Cup Food?
[2:01:06] Says, "Well, no, it does not means but
[2:01:08] you you know I mean if you have Jesus on
[2:01:10] the cross, it means that you he still on
[2:01:13] the cross."
[2:01:16] Oh man,
[2:01:18] we just limit ourselves just to a
[2:01:20] concept and now we think we are so
[2:01:23] revelated. We are so religious when
[2:01:27] there is more of God to know.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; There is more of God to know.
[2:01:35] THERE IS MORE OF GOD TO KNOW.
[2:01:39] CAN YOU IMAGINE GOD TELLING YOU KNOW
[2:01:41] COME AND walk with me in I want to take
[2:01:43] a walk with you and they agree and you
[2:01:45] know stop by and says are you I always
[2:01:47] wanted to come to this place I I always
[2:01:50] wanted to and he just stayed there
[2:01:53] he will never he will have never been
[2:01:55] raptured
[2:01:58] if you get stuck in an idea that's where
[2:02:00] you will stay
[2:02:03] because there is more of God to know
[2:02:06] there is MORE OF GOD TO LEARN.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Never take a very and you just wrap
[2:02:12] yourself in it.
[2:02:15] Nobody can I mean
[2:02:20] let your let your knowledge of the word
[2:02:22] benefit others.
[2:02:25] Let your knowledge of the word makes
[2:02:26] people comfortable to come around you.
[2:02:29] If you GET A STATIC KNOWLEDGE that looks
[2:02:31] like it's a it's a it's it's a septitan
[2:02:34] doctrine that looks stink and it's so
[2:02:36] scary because you believe that people
[2:02:38] can't come around you there is something
[2:02:40] wrong with that.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Your knowledge of Christ must create a
[2:02:48] sweet atmosphere around you
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; that will make people comfortable to
[2:02:52] come around YOU EVEN IF THEY DISAGREED.
[2:02:55] I DISAGREE WITH that guy, but I still
[2:02:57] love him. And just something about him.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm I'm so stuck in this place,
[2:03:11] I can't even go anywhere.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Uh deity of Jesus Christ. And today that
[2:03:18] me that memorial of his birthday, what
[2:03:22] do we do? They get some tree, cut it
[2:03:24] down, make a Christmas tree for the
[2:03:28] kids,
[2:03:29] but they think that's all right. I'm not
[2:03:33] kicking against that. Why we miss that?
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; What do we miss when he say I'm not
[2:03:39] kicking against it?
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE FOCUS.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT THE MAJOR THING HE'S TRYING
[2:03:47] TO GET. WHILE WE LEAVE THE WHOLE HEAVEN
[2:03:50] AND ALL THE BLESSING THAT GOD GAVE US
[2:03:52] AND SPEND UH TWO HOURS TALKING ABOUT
[2:03:54] CHRISTMAS TREE, CHRISTMAS LIGHT and
[2:03:56] Christmas, Christmas. What is that?
[2:04:04] Why we miss that? I'm not kicking
[2:04:06] against it. That's what he said.
[2:04:18] But the thing of it, they put more on
[2:04:21] the Christmas tree than they put on
[2:04:23] Christ. That is the focus.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE HE'S GOING WITH THE
[2:04:28] SUBJECT.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I promise you I will
[2:04:40] not study Christmas tree. I'm I'm being
[2:04:43] honest with you. I was not preparing to
[2:04:47] talk on this because to me that is some
[2:04:49] of the least thing I want to waste my
[2:04:51] time on.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's one of the least thing I want to
[2:04:55] waste my time on.
[2:04:59] I want to get closer to God.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage people to identify
[2:05:08] their find their identity as a son of
[2:05:11] God or the daughter of God. No matter
[2:05:13] what we are going through because I I
[2:05:15] will tell you that uh life
[2:05:18] life
[2:05:20] is a mystery.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; We are more spirit bane than we are
[2:05:27] humans. We are put in this body
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; to discover ourselves.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; God put you in this body for you to
[2:05:36] discover yourself. And all the days of
[2:05:39] your life that you live here, there are
[2:05:41] yet things you will not know about
[2:05:43] yourself
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; until certain situation comes your way.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:51] There are things that are healing in
[2:05:53] your genetics
[2:05:55] that it takes certain situation to bring
[2:05:58] it out.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[2:06:02] God will just look for the right kind of
[2:06:04] a person,
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; the right kind of a situation.
[2:06:08] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; If you if you bring everybody around
[2:06:16] you, he cannot get it out of you. You
[2:06:17] put some kind of a stubborn person on
[2:06:19] the phone.
[2:06:22] Yeah. One word they will say would just
[2:06:24] trick you up.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; You start yelling over your head.
[2:06:33] That's our journey on this earth. That's
[2:06:36] our journey. In as much as he want us to
[2:06:39] know about ourself, not only about our
[2:06:42] human nature, BUT AS A CHILD OF GOD, THE
[2:06:44] DEPOSIT that he has put in you, the
[2:06:46] abilities he have GIVEN TO YOU, THE
[2:06:48] POTENTIAL THAT HE THAT IS LAYING BEHIND
[2:06:51] YOUR FLESH.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET of God say is laying
[2:06:53] dominant in you. It's there. You have
[2:06:56] it.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; You are just all limited by your mind.
[2:07:04] The thing you think about yourself, you
[2:07:07] limit yourself with your mind. Your mind
[2:07:11] scares you
[2:07:13] and you cannot go a little further.
[2:07:19] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Your mind scares you.
[2:07:26] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:33] And that's what happened to all of these
[2:07:35] people, you know, that are on drugs or
[2:07:37] some kind of a substance. Their mind
[2:07:39] scares them that you cannot do without
[2:07:42] this. You really need this.
[2:07:45] No, try to go without it. You'll realize
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; you won't die.
[2:07:52] You won't die.
[2:07:55] If you just push yourself a little bit,
[2:07:56] you realize one whole day has gone and
[2:07:59] you don't have it.
[2:08:01] Praise the Lord. Amen. One whole day has
[2:08:05] gone, you don't have it. It's almost
[2:08:08] like you get to work and you and you
[2:08:09] forget that you you you left your phone
[2:08:12] home. You feel miserable,
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; but you will not die.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You're not going to
[2:08:20] die. Yes.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; If you can just get away from your mind,
[2:08:25] you will live a normal life and I
[2:08:28] promise you, you will be more
[2:08:29] productive.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; And when you have that little
[2:08:33] distraction,
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. YOU REALIZE THAT YOU
[2:08:46] HAVE A HEALTHY DAY.
[2:08:50] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; But I bet you your mind going to trick
[2:08:54] you again. Don't leave it home tomorrow.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; So what you going to do? You take it,
[2:08:59] you put it, you put it to the front
[2:09:01] door.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; I don't want to pass by this.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; That's the mind. That's the human mind.
[2:09:15] The Bible says the days of Noah, their
[2:09:17] imagination
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; was evil continuously.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; When the devil came down in the garden
[2:09:25] of Eden, what he did? He abused Eve in
[2:09:28] her mind.
[2:09:30] You see, when you do this, you will be
[2:09:32] like God. He reduced her
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; to give her a desire to be something
[2:09:38] that she's already.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; She's a daughter of God. She came right
[2:09:42] from the hand of God. She was God's
[2:09:45] daughter. She was a god. But what he
[2:09:48] did, he reduced her in the mind.
[2:09:53] You have to do this to be better.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; You have to dress like this to be
[2:09:58] better.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; And that's how the devil rob us. The
[2:10:08] things that we must be enjoying.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. the things we must be
[2:10:13] enjoying, the things that are just they
[2:10:15] are they are just given to us for US TO
[2:10:17] USE AND GET RID OF THEM.
[2:10:20] But he abused our mind.
[2:10:25] He sent us into judgment. He condemn us
[2:10:28] so quickly
[2:10:31] and then we have to go the whole day
[2:10:33] being condemned in our mind
[2:10:38] because someone said Merry Christmas to
[2:10:40] me.
[2:10:41] I said merry Christmas.
[2:10:44] I'm not supposed to say merry Christmas
[2:10:48] because I don't believe Christmas. So
[2:10:49] he's just playing with your mind. Just
[2:10:54] then you go the whole day as if somebody
[2:10:56] has died from you. Praise the Lord.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Say merry Christmas could kill you. You
[2:11:02] will die already.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Are you saying what I'm saying?
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:11:17] But what what I'm focusing on this
[2:11:19] morning is just to show how the whole
[2:11:23] concept of that it really blew my mind.
[2:11:26] Why God will give brother Brandham a
[2:11:29] vision of two two boxers.
[2:11:33] What will become of them? Nobody know.
[2:11:36] Yeah. say he having a vision of two men
[2:11:38] fighting six weeks before it happened.
[2:11:42] The very day he's preaching, READING
[2:11:44] FROM JEREMIAH CHAPTER 10,
[2:11:47] HE WOULD RATHER TELL US IF IF IF IF if
[2:11:50] Christmas tree was abominable.
[2:11:53] WHY, BROTHER BRAND, WHY GOD WOULD NOT
[2:11:55] GIVE HIM A VISION ABOUT CHRISTMAS tree
[2:11:58] when HE'S PREACHING FROM JEREMIAH
[2:12:00] CHAPTER 10, BUT then gave him a vision
[2:12:02] OF TWO MEN FIGHTING and one kill the
[2:12:04] other one.
[2:12:07] Praise the Lord.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; There is nowhere in the message where
[2:12:11] you see brother Brandon interpret
[2:12:13] Jeremiah 10
[2:12:19] that he means Christmas tree.
[2:12:22] You won't find it. If you find it,
[2:12:24] please bring it. I need it. It will help
[2:12:28] me in my walk with Christ.
[2:12:30] Praise the Lord.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now again, grab the concept of
[2:12:34] where I'm going this morning. Amen. Grab
[2:12:38] the concept of where I'm going this
[2:12:40] morning.
[2:12:41] I'm not sending every one of us to
[2:12:43] Walmart right after the service going
[2:12:44] for Christmas tree. That's not what I'm
[2:12:46] doing.
[2:12:48] That is not what I'm doing.
[2:12:50] It's just that it caught my attention.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; When I was looking into the subject or
[2:12:57] what I wanted to talk about, it just
[2:12:59] amazed me.
[2:13:01] It amazed me,
[2:13:04] you know, and and and again, it just
[2:13:05] brought more light to what the life of
[2:13:08] blood ranom was. He's driving with this
[2:13:11] man and he breaks into a vision. Six
[2:13:13] weeks dreaming about it. I mean, having
[2:13:15] a vision of these two men fighting and
[2:13:17] one kill. He look at it, he think about
[2:13:20] it. He did not see any spiritual
[2:13:22] application. So, he just wrote it down
[2:13:24] in his notebook.
[2:13:26] Never said nothing about it until it
[2:13:28] came in a paper.
[2:13:31] that two two men were fighting and when
[2:13:33] he realized yeah it was in New York. It
[2:13:35] was the very same arena that I saw them
[2:13:37] fighting.
[2:13:40] Praise the Lord.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:46] At least people will say is that well
[2:13:48] you know if brother Brandon never preach
[2:13:51] from a certain part of the Bible I can
[2:13:53] never preach from it. Well that that is
[2:13:55] for them. But Jerus said now, okay, he
[2:13:57] preached from this one. Jeremiah 10, he
[2:13:59] preached from it. He ran from it,
[2:14:03] but he never said one word
[2:14:06] about Christmas or about Christmas tree.
[2:14:11] Here he talks about the idol that the
[2:14:13] church had got themselves in. What
[2:14:16] brother was dwelling on on THAT MESSAGE
[2:14:18] IS HOW THE people are dismayed at the
[2:14:22] supernatural.
[2:14:23] HE SAID BECAUSE THE CHURCH HAS GOT INTO
[2:14:26] IDOLATRY THAT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE
[2:14:28] MOVE of God. They don't know the
[2:14:31] supernatural because Jeremiah says they
[2:14:33] are dismayed at the sign.
[2:14:39] He says even a Pentecostal church will
[2:14:41] not allow me to come and minister for
[2:14:43] them because they are dismayed at the
[2:14:46] supernatural.
[2:14:48] Say what what have where have we got to?
[2:14:52] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Maybe let's look for another time. This
[2:15:01] it's almost after 1:00 here
[2:15:04] and take you to where I wanted to go
[2:15:06] this morning with uh picking up your
[2:15:10] pen, right?
[2:15:12] Uh
[2:15:15] I'll take you to where I wanted to go
[2:15:17] this morning because uh what what I'm
[2:15:19] beginning to see as I said in the
[2:15:22] subject. Brother Bam said that his
[2:15:24] spoken word is the original seed. I want
[2:15:27] you to listen close to this.
[2:15:30] Here is where the spirit said pick up
[2:15:32] your pen. He said I want you to listen
[2:15:36] close to this. Praise the Lord. It's the
[2:15:40] same way when he preached the
[2:15:41] thanksgiving message invisible union and
[2:15:45] he read from Romans chapter 7. He says
[2:15:48] this this scripture is normally used
[2:15:51] about marriage. He said but it's more
[2:15:54] about prophecy.
[2:15:57] He said PAUL WAS PROPHESYING about the
[2:15:59] church.
[2:16:03] Praise the Lord. HE SAID IT'S MORE ABOUT
[2:16:05] prophecy
[2:16:08] than how we normally use it about
[2:16:11] marriage. It's more about prophecy. SO
[2:16:14] HERE HE'S BRINGING A PROPHECY TO US. He
[2:16:16] said pay attention here. The spirit said
[2:16:19] pick up your pen. Now you look in the
[2:16:21] book of revelation. I'm closing here. I
[2:16:23] don't if I if I go any further I will
[2:16:25] keep you here uh you look in the book of
[2:16:28] revelation. You see how the Bible says
[2:16:30] uh uh uh uh uh and unto the church of
[2:16:34] Epheso, right?
[2:16:38] Praise the Lord.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; AND ONTO THE CHURCH of Simna, right?
[2:16:46] Now, so you you studed the book of
[2:16:48] Revelation, you realize that Jesus,
[2:16:52] that's the only book that Jesus is the
[2:16:55] author of.
[2:16:57] Praise the Lord.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; BUT YET HE'S HAVING JOHN AS A SCRIBE TO
[2:17:02] write
[2:17:04] as he dictates his message to the
[2:17:06] church.
[2:17:09] Praise the Lord.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; SO IN ANOTHER SENSE HERE is that we're
[2:17:14] going to see that what took PLACE IN THE
[2:17:17] BOOK OF Revelation
[2:17:20] that because THE MESSAGE TO THE CHURCHES
[2:17:22] IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION WAS A
[2:17:24] PROPHECY.
[2:17:26] AMEN. Paul never knew that he was a
[2:17:28] messenger to to the Ephesus church.
[2:17:32] Praise the Lord. ALL OF THOSE
[2:17:33] MESSENGERS, THEY NEVER KNEW THAT THEY
[2:17:35] WERE MESSENGERS to the church ages.
[2:17:39] BUT HERE IS GOD SENT A PROPHET HERE WITH
[2:17:42] WITH WITH this ministry. AND HE SAYS
[2:17:45] THAT HE GOT THE KEYSTONE, the keystone
[2:17:48] to the WORD OF GOD. AND WITH THAT
[2:17:50] KEYSTONE REVELATION, HE WAS ABLE TO
[2:17:52] DETERMINE ALL THE MESSENGERS OF the
[2:17:55] church ages.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I love the way brother brother
[2:18:04] Andre said it the other time. He says uh
[2:18:08] uh UH YOU ARE NOT YOU ARE NOT ONE Paul
[2:18:12] to be you. We we would wouldn't have
[2:18:15] chosen Paul because we some OF US WILL
[2:18:19] STRUGGLE WITH THE FACT that he
[2:18:22] participated in the death of Stephen.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; And the the most person he talk about
[2:18:32] also he says Luther
[2:18:37] how how come that Luther became the
[2:18:40] messenger of his age?
[2:18:45] Amen.
[2:18:46] How did he became the messenger
[2:18:50] of a church age?
[2:18:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:55] Luke Luther was still smoking a pipe.
[2:19:00] Being a German, he was still drinking.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; With everything that we know about the
[2:19:13] message of the hour, if it were left
[2:19:15] with us, we would never choose Luther.
[2:19:18] Many of us will struggle with choosing
[2:19:20] Luther. This is the man that called the
[2:19:22] Jews an antichrist.
[2:19:27] Praise the Lord.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; But think about it. He was in the age of
[2:19:32] justification.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; He was in the age of justification.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; A man of a sanctified life could never
[2:19:42] be a messenger of the age of
[2:19:44] justification.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AMEN.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; A MAN OF A LIFE FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[2:19:51] GHOST COULD NEVER BE THE BE THE
[2:19:54] MESSENGER OF THE AGE OF JUSTIFICATION.
[2:19:56] YOU NEEDED A MAN THAT WAS JUSTIFIED BY
[2:19:59] FAITH. WHEN A PERSON IS JUSTIFIED BY
[2:20:02] FAITH, THEY BELIEVE THE LORD JESUS YET
[2:20:06] THEY STRUGGLE with habits in their life.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; THEY STILL STRUGGLE WITH HABITS. THEY
[2:20:14] STILL STRUGGLE WITH DRINKING AND
[2:20:15] SMOKING. BUT THEY ARE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE
[2:20:18] THEY BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Do you see THE MIND OF GOD?
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; HOW GOD CHOOSE A MAN
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; THAT COULD WRITE A PUT ON THE CHURCH.
[2:20:33] THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE ONLY THING HE HAD TOLD. THE
[2:20:40] JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS AGE.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; HE GOD NEEDED THE RIGHT MAN.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; I love when brother Andre said he says
[2:20:53] he says the people said to Lu YOU GOT TO
[2:20:56] STOP DRINK. HE SAID IF YOU TELL ME TO
[2:20:58] STOP DRINKING I'll drink more.
[2:21:04] Praise the Lord.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; Man, you can't you can't beat the mind
[2:21:09] of God.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; You can't beat the mind. That's what
[2:21:12] brother says. All that we know about God
[2:21:14] is just a grain of sand. Try to pick up
[2:21:17] a grain of sand. Shift all and just get
[2:21:20] a little grain in your hands. You can't
[2:21:22] even see it.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; That's all your wisdom about God. That
[2:21:26] all your knowledge about God.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:42] And then when you come to our age,
[2:21:44] PEOPLE PEOPLE, HOW HOW CAN HOW CAN
[2:21:47] WILLIAM BRANDON BE THE MESSENGER of this
[2:21:49] age? He don't have no theological
[2:21:51] school. He don't have no uh uh because
[2:21:55] God in God's design, the messenger of
[2:21:59] this age never needed to to to to live
[2:22:03] on man's wisdom. It was an age where he
[2:22:06] saw high.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; So right from his birth, God gave him
[2:22:12] visions. He were born with visions.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Right from his birth,
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; he told his mother, "We're going to live
[2:22:20] in Albany." When he didn't even know
[2:22:23] where they call a MOTHER WAS SURPRISED.
[2:22:26] WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT FROM, BILL?
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; WHERE DID YOU HEARD ABOUT ALBANY?
[2:22:33] GOD DESIGNED HIS man
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; for the responsibility.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; He never needed to go to school. He
[2:22:40] never needed a theological school. God
[2:22:43] fashioned him that way.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; PAUL WAS GOING TO BE THE WRITER OF THE
[2:22:50] NEW TESTAMENT. So God put him under one
[2:22:53] of the best teacher, Galia.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THE BOOKS TO HIS FINGERS.
[2:23:00] GOD PUT HIM UNDER ONE OF THE BEST
[2:23:02] teacher in Israel at that time because
[2:23:06] he was going to be the writer of the New
[2:23:08] Testament.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; And when God looked down at this age,
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; there was no one good to be here but
[2:23:21] you.

[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; Oh God, precious Lord. Father God, you
[2:48:50] said in your word, there is no

[2:48:55] Give us Lord the spirit of liberty.
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; Let us find that freedom in our heart
[2:49:00] Lord
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; that if if it is not contrary to the
[2:49:03] word we must not bind oursel down with
[2:49:05] condemnation of father Lord God and drag

[2:49:17] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:49:21] We love you father
[2:49:26] precious Lord.
[2:49:29] Lord, you know my my burden this morning
[2:49:33] Lord Father was was actually that the
[2:49:36] Holy Ghost will teach us Lord Father
[2:49:40] we teach our hearts oh God how to give
[2:49:45] not only him money Lord
[2:49:48] but give our time oh God give our
[2:49:51] thoughts to the right thing give our
[2:49:54] strength to the right thing
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; that we will teach our children how to
[2:49:58] give Lord
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; because we give them and we teach them
[2:50:03] to give their siblings. We teach them to
[2:50:06] give people around them. Father, we
[2:50:08] teach them how to give in the house of
[2:50:10] God. Oh, Father,
[2:50:14] please Lord, that's my inspiration this
[2:50:17] morning. For God so loved the word that
[2:50:21] he gave his only begotten son.
[2:50:26] The culture of giving have just been
[2:50:28] abused from us. Oh God,
[2:50:31] &gt;&gt; as we go farther into this Christmas
[2:50:33] season,
[2:50:36] channel our hearts Lord Father
[2:50:42] to give Lord
[2:50:46] to give you time in prayer
[2:50:49] to give to the people around us Lord.
[2:51:05] Father, please Lord,
[2:51:08] teach us, oh God. Father,
[2:51:15] we are not going in the ways of the idol
[2:51:19] or the ways of the headaches because you
[2:51:21] have taken idolatry from our hearts and
[2:51:25] you have you are the one sitting on our
[2:51:27] hearts Lord.
[2:51:29] Father God, it's not a gift for someone
[2:51:31] that will make me worshiping idol Lord
[2:51:33] God. It's not because Lord a family put
[2:51:37] up a trade. I would think they are
[2:51:38] worshiping idols. Oh God, you have
[2:51:41] removed idol from our hearts and you are
[2:51:44] the one that is sitting resident in our
[2:51:46] hearts. Lord,
[2:51:48] help us to pass all of those things. Oh
[2:51:50] God, let's get to the things that are
[2:51:53] substance. Oh God,
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; let's get to the things that are real.
[2:51:57] Lord.
[2:51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; The same Lord. I don't want to make this
[2:52:02] pit an idol
[2:52:05] because it's not the pit, Lord. It's the
[2:52:07] word that comes from the pulpit. It's
[2:52:09] when the Holy Ghost comes down and take
[2:52:11] his word and break it to the house of
[2:52:13] the people. Father, that's what makes
[2:52:16] the service.
[2:52:18] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
