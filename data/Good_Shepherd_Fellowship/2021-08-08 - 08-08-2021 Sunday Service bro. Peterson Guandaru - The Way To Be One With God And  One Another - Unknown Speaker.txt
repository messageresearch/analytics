your hands together for jesus this morning all right let's go ahead and see we have a testimony this morning brother johnny you are welcome [Music] good morning scent i don't know where to begin if you like me no it's overdue many times you know when i ask god to do something for me i tell him if you do it i will testify in your name but then i don't do it and then another one will come i do the same thing but i don't testify so today you know i'm gonna testify maybe just two things you know because there's so many things he has done in my life you know that tamil not allowed me not to start naming them but a month ago we went to kentucky to to go visit family as i was coming back with my three kids on our way back it started raining very hard and it was very hard for me to sing so i said oh father god it's kind of hard for me to to drive you know with this rain coming hard like this can you please stop it so that way no i'll be able to to to to drive clearly literally i know after maybe just five minutes stop running and i was amazed it's like i was shocked but this that's how we are we ask something and then when you come to pass he's like oh is that simple so it stopped raining till we got to minneapolis and then it started running a little bit and needed to say that you know we got home safe so thank god for that um the other thing for about a year i was working a third shift at my job you know so i had to leave my three kids by themselves or not and you can only imagine living you know your children are home by themselves you know during the night and i pray to god and i say god you have to change the situation and the thing sent each one of us you have to find a verse in the bible to identify yourself that you can erase on if you don't have it please do so you have to remind god what he's saying his word he say you will not forsake us or leave us the just will not suffer because of the injuries and so forth and so forth you will not put more on us than you can bear so every time when i pray you know i will always remind him of those things and by the grace of god he is able to change that situation now you know i have a better schedule so i thank god for that the other thing i was having depending on my elbow my right head bone for a while you know and i even went to my doctor to shoot some steroids but the pain was still going on and then last sunday when i came you know um bro the one you know pray and after that you know the pain went away till this day you know i don't have that pain anymore and i thank god for that um like i said you know there's so many things not to to thank god you know that time and if i stay here and it's going to take the whole service even my conversion um 10 years ago you know when uh i got to know the message it was through somebody else god used somebody else for me to come to the message and even when my pastor you know which later on overcome my pastor when he came to my house i was drinking beer and to to believe the message in united states is very hard because you know the world you know things of the world is so just i mean it's i mean the devil you know you put these things you know i mean when you're in you know you think this is it you know so anyway that's a testament for another day you know but for me to be here you know to stand here you know after almost 12 years not drinking no smoking it's just a grace of god so everything about me not just a testimony i mean i never knew the message i never knew the message in my life i just had to pass her pastor karen in kentucky and this and personal one and even me staying here you know i always want to go back to kentucky because that's a home for me that's where i live since 1991 so even to move here we had to go to counseling with my wife to convince me and of course you know the ladies away i mean you have to give your wife a chance you know my wife wanted to move here because her family is here and so i went and told my pastor i said i don't want to move i i can't do that and then you say well jenny this is a marriage you have to go your wife wants to go you know so the whole time you know it's always been a struggle but when i meet somebody you know every there's two things i tell them one of the things that is holding me here you know believe it or not is this small church and also my job i say no i have a good job you know and i love my church but when it was time for us to move here because i thought i was living everything that i thought was good and i had a big house i had a small small business so everything was going good for me you know i didn't see the need you know to come here you know and start over but i can honestly say that you know i've seen the hands of god in my life and the life of my children so sometimes you know the things that you hold on to you know are not the things that really matter and just to finish you know i had to meet her meet uh pastor one was probably about four years ago i was coming to [Music] to minnesota for a vacation me and my wife and the children so i told my pastor well i'm going to minnesota now and uh i want to be able not to go to to service on sunday do you know any minister over there so he said yeah i know one you know and he gave me the name of pastor one and when i called him he did not hesitate he came and met us and we fellowship and from that time on you know we became good friends so when it was time to move here it was very easy for me now because i already became friend with person one so i'm very grateful to all of you for your prayer um [Music] it's been very hard i mean you know it's been very hard i think you know some of you guys know that you know maybe about a month ago i was not coming to church it was a struggle you know i'm gonna leave you with this right now a lot of people are talking about the mental illness that thing is real i suffer from depression because of my situation my separation with my work and during that time you know when it comes sunday i did not want to come to church and of course the devil made it easy not just to watch on land so that was my excuse when if i don't go i can watch it online i can stream it but you know when you're streaming a service it's not the same than being in church because you know when when it came sunday i mean it was hard for me to get out of bed even going to ger i mean to working on is just because you know i got to if i don't work i don't eat i can pay my bills but if there was a way for me to make a living without going to work i mean during that time you know i was just staying home i mean it hit me very bad i mean i just wanted to lay down you know and things like that you know so when you see somebody in church you don't know what they're going through you don't know their situation or when you see somebody not coming to church you don't know you know what you're battling but mental illness is real mental illness is real i know you know there's a lot of things not we don't talk about in church but depression is real may god bless you richly put your hands together for jesus oh yes um brother ariel i think we'll kind of skip here a little bit because of time we have a lot of special i think we'll have to skip that time is fast paint so um let's go to song um 369 i'll fly away then we'll invite the pastor to come over amen the offering box is right at the back if you have your offering you can please go ahead and do so while the service goes on let's go ahead and start please when this life is over we'll fly away [Music] hallelujah oh [Music] run away ah [Applause] [Music] dance shall never [Music] hallelujah so [Applause] in the name of jesus in the name of jesus [Music] in the precious name of [Music] [Applause] [Music] of jesus we [Music] tell me [Music] hallelujah in the name of jesus in the name of have jesus is [Music] is [Music] oh yeah [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord the lord bless you you can have your seed it's good to be in the house of the lord praise the lord it's gonna be in the house of the lord this morning we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus and i believe there is no stranger in the gates of the lord because we are all his children there are some that might be here for the first time and we want to agree to you and recognize you this morning praise the lord we have sister sheila sarah okay i think that they can got the spelling wrong but they asked your friend sister miracle you spoke about okay praise the lord it's good to have you sister thank you for making the time to come and be with us uh brother joe wilson good to have you brother you took me by surprise amen amen and we have our dear brother back there that's brother is that danny and sister linda okay good to have both for you with us this morning praise the lord amen joe is that your sister oh okay okay i see the resemblance there there's brother robert wilson sun down there we were with them all the testimony that i brought to you from illinois that was from their house praise the lord amen amen but we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus i hope i'm not uh leaving anybody out and it's uh so good to be in the house of the lord praise the lord thank you all for your prayers sir uh through the weekend we had to lay my nephew to rest yesterday but the week was pretty busy pretty busy and working with all the families there and trying to co-host with their church and all that but the lord was gracious the lord was gracious sin and i mean what a time what a time that we are living in and i don't believe that we are the only group of people that are ever going through time like this i believe that people in time past have experienced this most especially during the the times of past uh uh you know uh epidemic that have come upon the world like the black death and different things you know i mean some of those things whip out the whole family you know genocides in other countries whip out you know and and sometimes you know you just go from one one death to another it just looks like a kind of a dark cloud you know we just we just got out of the the funeral yesterday then and uh [Music] my wife went home to get some rest and and right in there the uh a lady that was close to her like a grandmother that she was caring for uh took her last birth so it's almost like we just went from one to another but you know the lord is gracious amen the lord is gracious uh he he he predestinated us for this hour this is our time and and i believe that we're not going to feel him praise the lord the prophet daniel saw this time and he said the people that know their god will do explode amen in the midst of everything we will do explode and it's not much in uh our ability of what we can do but it's just acknowledging him amen and giving all our praise to him giving all our weaknesses to him giving all our failures to him knowing that he promised he will never leave us he will never forsake us we can rest the show on there praise the lord amen you you just think about it you know i i saw brother brother peterson looking through the the fastest board of matches there in the office and you know and some of those things were just running through my mind what other people went through standing for the name of jesus christ you know i mean it's it's a it's a it's a pretty much delusion teaching or a false teaching for you to believe there when you become christian it's just going to be rosy for you i mean there are devils in hell that hate the name of jesus and hits you to identify with thy name praise the lord but our god is faithful praise the lord amen amen once again we greet you in the name of the lord jesus and uh [Music] it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning we have our friend uh brother pastor peterson gandaroo from nairobi kenya that is i just stopped by to see you this week and what a perfect time he came you know uh when my whole week was just so booked up with with different things and but uh i think it was a good service we had on wednesday night you know when when when a pastor tends to an evangelist then you know it's serious praise the lord but i believe that the holy ghost was mindful of us amen and i will tell you why i will tell you why i mean there were things that that uh brother peterson spoke on wednesday night i was sitting in my office at work and i was just going through some few scriptures and i wrote setting things down because of a situation and i just praying about it and said lord you know if that's what you want me to do i'm committing in your hands you know there were a few things that came to my knowledge and i thought that well i would need to address these things in church but you know what you don't want to do is that i've said that over and over here you never want to bring your anger behind the pulpit you know because god will only back his word god will not stand with your frustration or your anger and you could be under the wrong spirit saying the right thing you know and even though it is the right thing god will not back it because the spirit is wrong praise the lord so you have to get yourself right praise the lord so you know i had to get myself right because i was mad and i have to pray lord take it out of me take it out of me it's a spirit and i have to deal with it but i don't have to carry my anger to the pulpit so i can promise you i'm not angry amen i can promise you i'm not angry amen so uh but i mean there was a lot of wonderful things he said and and we we just appreciate the spirit of the lord coming i mean just after we came out of communion service and and he would come with their scripture from the book of you know corinthians taking the living out of the church you know getting after the foxes that support the vine you know what a beautiful way you know the presentation was it's not it's not it's not dealing with sin you know you go in the bulk of uh of of john uh let's let's turn that again first john first john let's turn there i'm not preaching here so don't stand up i'm just only greeting you the preacher will come we have a need here we will go into prayer right now for the knee that is before us but i just want to show you how important it was for the holy spirit to speak to us on wednesday night the way he did praise the lord we're looking into first john [Music] we're looking into first john first john chapter 1 verse 8 that was how we close the service on wednesday night but i just want to show you something here first john chapter 1 verse 8 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourself and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins now john is using two words speaking about two different things our sins are the mistakes our misbehaviors but if we say we have no sin which goes back to unbelief [Music] okay sin goes back and and you will see that beautifully in in the episode of first john ii john and ted john if you study it you will see how he went back and forth using those two words saints that speaks of our mistakes you know and sin that speaks of unbelief praise the lord so you see god deliver us from our sin which is our own belief but in the body of imperfection we think the things that we must not think we say the things that we must not say praise the lord and in that way we rob arms with the word that is the reason why we confess our sins are we together now so uh uh when he read that quote from the adoption series this is where the church is feeling on that walk and here john is saying when we walk in the light as he is in the light brother branham said the church is feeling on that walk our daily walk before god it's where we feel because it's so easy for us not to realize how we rub arms with the word so we we fell on that walk and he and he took this phrase and says our misbehaviors of unconfessions now before then i i i talk that as misbehaviors in the things that we do but the misbehavior is actually not confessing you're wrong even jesus when he taught the lord's prayer he says when you pray say father forgive us of our sins our trespasses now so to a believer that is born again and saved filled with the holy ghost it will be a misbehavior on your part if you believe that you don't have no wrongs [Music] it will bring the church to a complete failure because there is nothing in the word of god of sinless perfection no so every time we go to god we must say father forgive me of my trespasses failing to do that it will be a misbehavior because why you are not making use of the atonement that is speaking before the father if we don't have no mistake then we'd only want to be before the father [Music] praise the lord in a way that we miss josh thinks [Music] we hear things and we just random judgment without investigating it [Music] praise the lord now this is where i thought that god was very gracious to bring us their talk because in in alongside with that quote brother branham said that we could bring one before the church and pray for them and god will refuse to honor our prayer because we have this misbehavior of of uh uh uh you know seth rogers attitude so this morning we have a case that we will bring before the church for prayer and before we do that i want us to just go to the lord in prayer this morning and let's go to the lord in prayer while we bring this case before the church sister sister wilma says the kish will have to go back to see the doctor we know how the lord was gracious to us to to be able to grant our sister uh a level uh uh replacement liver surgery and uh she has to go back in to visit with her doctor and she will have to go back they will have to go and check on the liver it might be about a six hour surgery and [Music] so we want to bring her before the law this morning let's just buy our hearts before our sister come up let's take our house to the throne of grace this morning [Music] you all being mindful of his children y'all being mindful of us knowing that we will have a case to bring before the lord [Music] he asks us to search let's just play such mean of god let's play that first before we play only believe because i just want for every one of us to go in prayer this morning we want no hindrance to this request that we will make [Music] sir me and my heart today father try me [Music] know all my thoughts i prayed [Music] place me [Music] free let's sing that verse one more time sesh me now [Music] today know my toss lord i pray [Music] holy spirit [Music] oh jesus [Music] let you speak to the lord now this morning each and every one of us as we bring our sister to the throne of grace [Music] we'll follow the order of the scripture we will announce her with oil [Music] yes lord yes father lord we were reminded on friday uh wednesday night lord how down here for his heart lord jesus confessing his sin and the sin of the people oh dear lord father now even knowing the lord gail we will have a case like this this morning we kept our house before you father with different things lord and different situation of god but almighty god father we come this morning lord as a group of people father we come lord jesus identifying ourself for god all precious lord with your sacrifice lord almighty god lord the worshiper has never been on an examination he has always been the lamb they have been examined father oh god and we pray lord today i told spotless lamb this morning we pray oh god father lord to that spotless lamb of god father lord god that took away the sin of the word oh god we pray father lord we lift in our house to you this morning we say almighty god precious lord let the holy ghost go through this building this morning father says our hearts oh god precious lord if their father and in presumption saying that in a healing fossil god in an area of our lives that we are struggling and we need you god we are being merciful this morning father we know that god and nothing in ourselves we can bring this morning lord but just to embrace who god father your bleeding word embrace the promises in your bleeding world father o god we thank you lord we praise you we glorify your holy name o god oh sweet jesus what a wonderful father what a wonderful savior you are god lord jesus you have given us a commission lord and father god just like you told joshua father god there will be no army lord there will be no man or god to stand before the captain of the lord host father so we believe oh god father the promise is given to this new testament church of god that father lord god there will be lord god no no no illness lord father that we will not bring in the name of the lord jesus christ the father god that you will not be able to heal we thank you precious lord we glorify you this morning lord thank you father thank you for the opportunity that we can expose ourselves to you this morning as we take on this challenge your god blessed be the name of the lord all we thank you father we thank you jesus we thank you precious lord

and [Music] i do believe that this is the best place to be at this hour and i believe this is the most comfortable place to be among the saints of god and among the people of like faith and [Music] we thank god because we are here to talk with our god who is real and who has sustained us along the way may the lord bless you very much as you take your seats uh so for those of you that were not here with us on wednesday i want to to deliver greetings from home from our church in lobby they sent me greetings together with my family i've been here now for about two weeks in the lord willing i'll be here for the next one a month and we're going back home on 4th september uh it's been my privilege privilege given to me to come and fellowship with you along this in this church and i want to thank pastor warren for having confidence that i can see something that can be useful to the church and so this morning i pray that the lord will hold me i say something that you make this journey lighter for you and some ways that you strengthen you encourage you to serve god may the name of the lord be glorified amen so we thank god very much for this morning i want you to know that i'm very comfortable in brother langnaat and sister langna's house they are keeping me very well i'm supposed to go home maybe maybe go back to new jersey on tuesday if you find out that i will still be here on wednesday it's because of the comfort that i'm getting down there and i really appreciate them so much so we thank god because god has continued to work in his people and that's what i've realized everywhere i go there was a lady who was telling me that in the church they are being very very blessed extraordinarily blessed i thought you were like me and telling me come and see i answered back and told her my experience tells me that there is only one preacher and that preacher is the holy ghost and that preacher is preaching everywhere and he's walking everywhere so we can't have one spot where we have to go to fight god uh all other just to get blessed god is working with people his people i realized that when i came here on wednesday i felt the praises of god down there in new jersey in a church and when i came here after a short while i just felt the same presence and i felt the same god around here we have come to know through this message that is god working in his bride amen and wherever his bride is god is there working we all need different vessels that he uses to accomplish his work so we thank god so much for his goodness and for his mercy president of our lord all right this morning i have our two scriptures to read let us read from the book of genesis chapter one verse 36 and verse 27 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness i hope everything's okay can you hear me and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them our next reading is come from the book of john chapter 17. and verse 11 and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through their own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are verse 21 that they all may be one as our father are in me and i in thee they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me in the glory the glory which thou gives me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one the lord giving me grace i'll talk about another title my preaching this morning as the way to be one with god and with one another may the lord bless this one as we pray precious every father confess our inability and that's why god will come to you for strength and ability we pray that you speak to us and father i pray that you help me to include myself that you can take over the lord and speak to the people that are gathered here this morning i pray that you reveal yourself to them lord every statement that i may say father may be of value in their hearts and that you may reveal and give them the understanding you comment ourselves in your hands father in the name of jesus christ our lord amen may be seated okay uh the way to be one with god and with one another the union between ourselves at god is typed in marriage where there is supposed to be oneness between husband and wife therefore the african marriage union is a type of the heavenly marriage and union i'm reading some quotes now marriage is one sense a type is a type the ma the earth after a marriage is a type of the heavenly marriage now let's go over it just for a few moments to rehearse it a moment the first thing they all is there must be a decision made the first thing takes in natural marriage is a decision has to be made the young lady has to make her decision whether she wants this young man and the young man whether he wants the young woman there has to be a decision made and you have to make it yes she must be the only woman in the world that you love and he must be the only man if it isn't then you made a wrong decision amen marriage is an individual decision you have to decide yourself to be married by this man to marry this girl i know it may not have a lot of meaning what i'm saying but it has a lot of meaning in our communities in africa in africa there are many communities and traditions that it is your father and mother that choose for you whom you are going to marry and i have witnessed just a young man goes home in the over the wicked the judge's young man not married and he comes back on on monday with a wife and you ask him what happened he says when i reached home i found my mother and my father had already organized for my bride and i just got ready at home so i just picked the lady now she's my wife of course we don't accept as such uh we know what the bible says yes but i'm showing you how it is what that all means it must be your decision yes there are some extreme cases i have one in mind in the certain community i was doing some evaluation in certain parts of our country actually is a remote area and in that area when a young man wants to marry you don't go to talk to the girl you have no business with a girl at that at that juncture all you need to go is go and talk with the father and you discuss with your father and you negotiate the dory five cows 20 cows normally it's very expensive about 20 cows and then you go around and look for the cows all this time you have not talked to the girl you only identified the girl and you laughed you liked the girl let me not use the word love but you just liked and then you pay the cows and then the father says okay now that is settled you can go and look for the gavel overseas if you fight high in the river drawing some water well if you find her coming from the market you just take her and then you go hunting for the girl and you you get some young energetic men just to help you carry the girl you get the girl whenever she's you don't even talk you just carry her on your shoulder and holler into your house and he becomes your wife therefore when we are preaching this the prophecy the decision must be yours if he's a young man if he's a young man it's not your mother is heading for you it's not your community standing for you it's not the pastor even siding for you oh when people come to me i want to marry a certain guy pastor what do you think i tell them no it's up to you it's up to you i can't tell you to marry her or not to marry her it's up to you is your decision it got to be positioned because if i tell you mariha and then when you get home she becomes troublesome to you you come to blame me so it's up to you if you want to take a tiger and put it in your house and the tiger turns against you is up to you have you made that choice if you want to put a lie on a male lion in your house sister it's up to you you know a male lion does not hunt and when the female gets catches uh a prayer is that the la the male lion is first first one to eat no female wheat until the middle lion is satisfied if that's the kind of thing that you want to do is up to you that decision praise the name of the lord [Applause] and that's the way it is by making the decision for christ the first thing you have to do is make up your mind whether you are going to serve god and take him as your savior yes this is a decision you have to make not your mother not your father a young man a young woman you come to an age where you have to make a decision about christ it's not a family religion here some some of the effects of the young people and the young young people say oh when people ask why don't you wear trousers he said no i call according to a church we don't wear he's not according to a church it must be your decision and you must be able to defend your decision because it's yours whatever teaching whatever doctrine whatever behavior you must be personally answerable because you made a decision about their faith it's not the church it's you you hear the word of god it's preached to you you make a decision amen amen no so you have to make up to make your decision serve god or take him as your savior or you're not going to do it the reason why it must be your decision is because in your faith you will be persecuted you will suffer so if it is not your own decision you will be defeated you'll not be able to fight for it yes something that is your choice you'll be able to defend and fight for your choice that's right so it has been your choice amen we find that it's very common with the children of believers they grow in the faith they grow in the church from the time they were just small there was god bless you god bless you so god bless you became something that is like a tradition you see like the order of things oh god bless you god bless you and finally sometimes you find that you have reached the age of maybe nine years or ten years and then the mother asks you oh you know now you have reached the age of ten years of contability can you be baptized yes you can be how can you be baptized it's not decision it's not the age it's not reaching to the edge is he reaching to the decision to follow christ amen now so whether you're going to serve god and take him as your savior or you are not going to do it are you going to serve the world are you going to serve christ you have to make up your might there has to be a decision made when you make up your might that you are either going to serve god or mama then you take your choice but the decision has to be made praise the name of the lord i do believe that i'm sitting in front of people that at one time in their life they made a decision to first serve god they made a decision to follow the message praise the name of the lord now ascension must be made and then after the decision is made that you are then comes the engagement that is the marriage now that you find that at the altar you find that at the altar get to the altar and at the altar you pledge your engagement to that girl to that boy you have got to make an engagement before the union can be and that's the way it is with christ church it has to be an engagement with christ a pledge an engagement i love affair amen amen with christ is a pledge i pledge to serve him i pledge to work with him i pledge to walk by his wife i pledge to live for him you are engaged to christ and that one now becomes a love affair between you and christ when you say you love god you love christ is a love affair that has taken place in your life and then the next thing is promise made there has to be promises made to one another like that you make promise so that if you marry me i promise that i'll be loyal and true i'll look upon no other woman or i look upon no other man and i'll do all that as a duty as a wife we have children it will do to do all as a duty as a mother i'll be a housekeeper all these promises has got to be made or should be in the correct wedding i encourage the young people who are preparing to get marriage to have a lot of conversation and discussion you don't just walk into a marriage without any promises you got to know one another you go to understand what one believes about the family there's one one young man and one guy who walked into my office in the church and told me okay we want to get married i ask them how much how for how long have you known each other they told me one month i told them wake up and go never come to this office of mine until about three four months how do you just speak just a stranger in rushing to the off to the office of the pastor and you start talking about marriage you don't know that man you are you are marrying a stranger you got to know each other you go to discuss you got to to engage one another and talk i tell them talk about money issue because in marriage you fight their money becomes a problem so discuss the principles of your of your finances talk about it talk about how many children you are going to have [Music] you go to before you get into that engagement discuss about it there are some men that want their wives to have 20 children 15 and they have a scripture replenish the earth but brother madam said you're not the only one that is going to feel the world give also the chance for the other people all to fear their part it's not you alone so you can't discuss that because it brings problems in marriage let's try to bring problems yeah like you know like in our community my community you so we name our children according to our to a narrative for example if i get a first born son is named after my father if i get a daughter he's named after my mother the second bone he was a boy is named after the father of or my wife if he is a girl is named after like that like that like that therefore even if i got 20 children their names are already there and my and my relatives put pressure they say you must be a one after me how can you stop there before you have given back to one after me so if you're not careful you can get on bearing and you're bearing for other people they don't look after those children you're the one who look after them so these are discussions you discuss you have to know how to go about those areas promises i'll do this yeah i'll stay at home and look up the children do you agree to do that yeah or you just want to work in the office you've got to agree on those things so that these things don't bring problems later so there has to be an uh a promises now and that is very important the issue of promises is very important amen and that's the same thing when you come to christ lord if you receive me in your kingdom i promise yeah you are i love you i'll be true to you i'll serve you day and night it's too bad we forget that i'll serve you day and night i'll fast i'll pray we forget that i'll be going to church and then you forget that and then you start live streaming at home sitting at home live streaming you don't belong to any church you don't go to any church let me talk like i'm talking to my church you don't just sit at home and have the tips on sunday soccer to have tips but church is church time for church is church you must have a pastor you must have the people that you fellowship with you worship with you make promises but you don't keep them as soon as we forget that i'll serve you dare night our first our prayer below to you i'll bring my thai things into the storehouse i'll pray many times a day i'll do anything and i pledge all my love to you that's what you should do that is exactly right you promised that and it should come from your heart the promise should come from your heart i'm emphasizing that i'm stopping so they can soak in you the promise must come from your heart if you promise your husband that and not from your heart yep in other words you don't mean it if you are absolutely not living correctly with him you are you are absolutely not living correctly with him is kind of a criticalized affair it's a very serious thing you make the promise but you don't keep it you don't need to keep it why would somebody just make a promise just want to fasten you know to make the marriage very fast very fast it's because maybe your purpose of marriage you just want to get married yeah so when you promise you do those things you don't mean it because if your girl maybe what you want when you say when you tell the man i love you you actually don't mean it what you mean i love your money that's what you are saying all right and i love your money because your money can finance my my the taste of my lifestyle the kind of lifestyle that i want to live so you don't mean it you're not faithful in your statement and on the other hand the man is talking about oh i'll do this i'll do this i'll do this you are this you allah i love you so much i love you this what what what some of them i say oh i love you so much when i think about you i cannot even eat and if you look what he ate last night you don't mean it if you promise your house by that and not from your heart you mean it you are absolutely not living correctly with him it's a kind of crucial fear now look here if you haven't got teeth this is the example the example of that condition where you give the promise and keep that in mind about christ and you don't actually mean it it's like this if you haven't got teeth and you use false teeth now that's all right it is substituting for the teeth that you once had but actually those teeth are not connected with you it's not part of you if you had an arm amputated and you put a force arm on well that arm is actually not connected with you it's just stuck on you it's not connected with you that kind of a marriage that kind of relationship is like the relationship between teeth the natural teeth and the first teeth they are not connected they have no relationship well both of those teeth are in the same mouth they show they sell food together but they are not connected you will be leaving the same house you may be walking out together in the morning as you go to work and drive in the same car but if the promise you made to one another was not correct you never meant it actually you are not connected coming out of the same door living in the same room does not connect you the thing that connects you is that sincere honest promise to one another if i take very cold water in my mouth ice water the natural teeth will complain the first teeth will say what are you talking about what's wrong because they cannot participate in the pain and the feelings that's the kind of marriages sometimes you have because you are not connected you cannot share the joy you cannot share the disappointments of one another you cannot share the feelings of one another you cannot grieve together because you are not connected you wonder why are these two people so different because they don't have the feeling of one another because they were never collected in the beginning if i have a la force hand and on the other hand i had an accident the other hand was broken his heart has no feelings just can get connected there's a fellowship with the other bloodless of their body it's not condemned there's nothing there's no union remember i'm talking about the way to be one with god and with one another the connection praise the name of the lord now so there are people that are in that marriage condition that they are not actually connected they are not united because everything that unites is that genuine and honest promise to one another and the prophet said even if a girl and a young girl and a young boy got to that level of that kind of a commitment honest anxiety to one another that is marriage that's the one that brings the union now and the prophet makes some certain hear that and when we take our pledge to christ if we don't become part of him like a woman ought to become part of a man and a man part of the woman then we are artificial christians this morning i'm talking about artificial christians you have never made a pledge to christ you have never entered into a love affair with him because you have never been honest with him and have a moment of yourself between you and christ excluding anybody else including your parents including anybody else you arrive for your husband but it's you and christ and you are establishing a person no pledge to him to serve him and pray for him not anybody pushing you to come to church when you have come to your personal pledge to christ and you have a love affair to christ there is nobody that's going to push you to come to church no nobody is going to push you to pray nobody is going to to follow you up to feel like to live for what you will leave the world whether there is anybody around you or nobody around you you are obligated to jesus christ and to the relationship that you already have established with christ this is what we need to have this is what we have to be sure and it is there with us with every one of us here sometimes you wonder whether we really are in that level you fight when the husband stops coming to church the wife also stops and goes out of the church for six months when the man comes back to church the wife also troops back in the church do you have your own study do you move by the impulse of your husband do you have your own personal start with christ when your husband backs right you also backslide there has to be a personal relationship and when we take our pledge to class if we don't become part of him like a woman ought to become part of a man and a man part of the woman then we are artificial christians the description of that condition is artificial you're not real you're just like a false truth with christ you are just like a false truth with christ you are in church you are praying you are singing but you are artificial christian we are not here you are really not married to that woman that's the polish if it is like that that's not marriage we are not here you are really not married to that woman you might be loyal if you don't love your husband and him 60 or 70 years old and you don't love him as good as you did at the beginning then you are really just raising his children there is something that is in our country that is called calm with tea i don't know whether you know anything like that have you ever heard of it calm we stay arrangement what it is is that a a man just takes a woman and they start living together they have not commit they are not committed to each other you ask her is this your husband you say no we just live together is this your wife no we just live together it's an arrangement to stay together and they get children in those circumstances they have children and then there's a certain point they may they may part everyone goes his own way there was no marriage they are not committed to each other in the government listener was trying to pass around and saying if you have that calm we stay situation and you continue like that for a certain number of years the government will consider you are married of course to me that is wrong because marriage is not stinging together for wrong people it's a commitment that you make to each other that's what makes her a marriage many people have that and the sad thing is that the people who may think they are married but because there was any no genuine commitment to each other they are leaving that state and the brabham says what what is what is that now he says this 17 years and you don't love him as good as he did at the beginning then you are really just erasing his children you are not in a condition of marriage just amazing student that's the way the churches are too to uh too many today we are just taking the name of christian church pretending to be the bride when it is artificially we are not connected with christ in any way we are like an artificial truth artificial arm artificial eye see is something that is artificial if you are just putting it on where you can put on christianity you have got to be connected with it so this morning i'm saying we've got to be connected with christ we've got to be connected with god marriage is a connection is a union and they must get into that condition now let me come to this now what is the way to be connected how do we get connected with god because that's what type we've got to come to the review the connection between us as individuals to christ now the first man and the first woman in the garden of eden was in perfect harmony with god so much that god could come down at any time he desired and talk left to ear with adam and eve now that is perfect oneness god and his creation god speaking left to ear with adam and eve and they were so perfect in harmony with god till they are one with god god and his family was one we are fighting the connection here we are filing the oneness that was there between god and his past family god would come down at any time he desired and note god coming down to his people is a sign of oneness his presence in the church he is a sign of the oneness between christ and his church and this is what demonstrated his oneness with his family because he was frequent frequent in the in the ministry coming down to talk to them and also god talked to them live to ear with him god and his family they were one when god comes and speaks to our church here when god comes and he presses here is a union that is there between there is a relationship between us and christ by showing his presence and god talking to us remember when there was a disconnection between saul and god god never spoke to saul neither by dream nor by uri muthumi no in any manner the communication was totally cut off because they were not they were disconnected so what is connected with god when the church is disconnected with god god never speaks god never deals with our church and so we see when god was coming down every time and talking with them and conversing with them speaking to them left to ear it was the connection that was there between god and his family and saying that that was a perfect union with his family now and i do believe that god purpose today is to have the same kind of a union with his church because god still has a family do you believe that and in the same way that he wanted to have a such a kind of a union with his family in the beginning that is the same thing that god has in mind today to be in union with his family now i i normally ask this question why is god not talking to us in such a manner of course god speaks to us with his word correct but god was coming personally there and appearing before them god has ever appeared to his people frequently like he did in the church of islam as they were moving from egypt to the promised land with a pillar of fire and all that showing how the union he earned with his people now uh if god is not speaking to us frequently as he did and in the same manner that he did in the beginning is not because that god has stopped to love that kind of union it is either because there is something that is separating us from him otherwise that is the perfect will of god that he may have that kind of a union with his church so we shall see as you go on now okay this is a kind of union we see the heart god was coming down there frequently talking to them conversing with them talking to adam and eve left to ear all that union was there and that's a demonstration of the kind of union that god had with his first family now why do they have that kind of a union the reason was because another let me read this that's god's purpose god's purpose is for him to however the same kind of a union with his family praise him otherwise if god has a family today which i believe he has is that right that is a same purpose he has for that family to be not perfect union with that particular family and his purpose as a father supreme was to be one with his family athletic family adam and eve and they're only that they could be one with a family what was a principle what was abiding thing that was there that brought this union and the only way that they could be one with a family or with god was because god's nature was in them praise the name of god if there is a family of god somewhere and it's not having any union with god and not having that close union is because the church has gotten another nature [Music] but the thing that made god and his first family to be so united is because in the beginning genesis chapter 1 26 god created them in his image so they shared a portion of god's nature and because of that nature that is a factor that made them to be united nature praise the name of the lord yes brother preached this message called the lamb of the deaf he said when the dove came down which was the holy spirit and it could never settle on any other animal except the lamp why did it sit on the lamp because the holy spirit or the dove and the lamp they share the nature and that's the only way that thou that that now death could come into the lamp the lamp could not come into a dog could not come into a into a roof because there was a contrary nature therefore if there is going to be a union between god and ourselves something must come and impart in us god's nature just like the first family that nature must be put in us and by that nature we share the same nature with god then it brings a union may the name of the lord be glorified that's what made them to have that oneness god put in them during the creation he put his nature in them hallelujah and if you notice how that if was united with adam she become part of him come back to tomorrow again adam and eve were one is that right what made them want what made them united because they had the union it was because when god created adam he created adam and eve as one as one spirit so originally they were one spirit and then god came down and put that both of them enough in the body of flesh they were still together in what body of flesh until god came again now separated them and even in separating them eve had the flesh of adam and the bone of adam they shared with the bones under and the flesh so they were one there was not union because they shared the same nature they shared the same material and we always know that that's a type of christ if there ever going to be a union between christ and his church christ and his church must share the material that makes each other we must have his spirit we must have his word we must have his truth we must have everything that was in christ must be in the bride to bring that common union praise the name of the lord i was reading a quote have i've got the quotes here but i'm not going to read them and what was saying uh the love of christ makes us one if we have the love of god i have the love of god truly that makes us one okay and i was applying also that one that is agape love but in philly love also when a husband and a wife loves each other truly when when a young man and a young woman love each other truly that makes them one i don't believe there should be any other circumstance to bring two people into marriage except laugh if it is not under the circumstances of love for each other that marriage should not work in marriage there are many challenges one of the challenges is that you keep on offending each other and the only way you can ever continue living together is in the circumstance of love because if you love the person you'll bear the person love covers a multitude of mistakes his only love that can be able to flourish in this in those circumstances if you did not love that girl if you don't love that boy maybe you love this money maybe you loved her legs you married the legs and you took legs to your house or you took some good hair that will not be sustainable at one point it will not work in the circumstances where he or she offends you that comes as it doesn't do what you like it is not going to to survive but in the circumstance of love may the name of all be glorified love makes people one when there is love whether you are old whether you are young you still remain loving each other love does not fade away love is not consumed by age no the more older you are living together in a state of love the more united you are and the more love you have but if you looked at wealth this man is wealthy you forget that the bible says that wealth has got wings one day it will flap his wings and then do what fly away and then marriage has nothing to lean on it was hanging on money it is a really little challenge money i find here in america there are a lot of jobs i see things that i've never seen in my country we are hiring you'll never see that recently there was an interview for they wanted two teachers in a certain school and the people who turned up qualified for that position to teach were four 400 people and they were picking only two another place in the in in ghana i was seeing it in a in a internet they wanted some some so recruiting some soldiers the line was stretched the whole street then turns to the next then turn to the next even those at the behind even they don't see what is happening is about three or four kilometers away is that an unemployment you may lose your job and getting another one becomes very difficult maybe the only person who has a job now is a wife if you need anything your wife your wife there is a temptation of her reaching someone saying why don't you be like other men go out and look for something it's a difficult situation so love works there a challenge love love unites now let's is something here also here now listen so we got to know what unites us what unites us with christ what brings us together with christ what brings that oneness we have seen that also love love brings oneness in the people yes right now now don't you see on the day of pentecost we find the holy spirit the pillar of fire separating itself and setting upon each member of the church god putting himself together then with that group of people together what does it do brings back the unified body yes of the lord jesus when god defied himself a portion of god entered in one person the other person of god entered another person on the day of pentacles because that is exactly what took place now the prophet is telling us now when that happened that fact of a portion of god coming into every one of those people unified those people first it unified them with god blessed be them alone they were joined together with god there was a heavenly wedlock between them and god join in heavenly wedlock to the eternal god that fact of god sharing himself in the in them at the broader heavenly wedlock to the eternal god part of him part of god oh president god look at the first union how did it come god created people he created adam and eve in the same image in the same likeness they shared the nature the apportion of god was with them and now on the day of pentecost god comes again and a portion of yourself which is the holy spirit came upon each one of them and the prophet says what happened there was a a heavenly wedlock to eternal god part of him part of god in the flesh in other words in other words they became part of god now that act of god coming down and entering in them and making now this heavenly wedlock bringing that union is actually that brought the condition that we read in the book of acts chapter 4 and verse 32. and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart is that correct and one word so why because a portion of god came upon each one of them and brought this union in the individual with god first when that union is there with god for us by a portion of god being in each one of them then the union with one another was automatic they became of one heart and of one soul may the name of the arabic graphics they became a unified body of the lord jesus christ because they were brought into that condition of one heart and one soul now then they were one with one another hey amen now now there's a challenge there and today in this great separation that we are living in denominational differences and things what a pity what are this grace let me not talk about illumination let me put it this way and today in this great separation that we have in the message believe us differences and things what a pity quota pity i'm not criticizing but let me say this when i was in new jersey i found here you have something you call harmony in the desert how many have heard of that okay those are meetings where believers come and they are there about i don't know much but if i get if i'm wrong maybe i didn't get the details but i heard that believers come together for about one week and all what they do is singing no preaching isn't it no preaching why no preaching because they are fearling if you preach you'll differ isn't it there'll be differences that's why we are saying blah blah blah is saying here it's a pity it's a disgrace that we can be divided as believers yeah we got to come together we fear each other in such a manner that we cannot open the bible and read to you i cannot even read the message why don't they come and just read the message read the word only if you are feeling that that if somebody preaches there will be differences that's what we have reached it's a pity the division may the name of that be gratified it is so about so bad it's too bad but these people had one heart and one soul what does it mean to me it means what they had we may not have they had something that united them they had something that put them together the name of the qualifying no look at the pentecostals pentecostals they are wrong now recently the government in our country introduced was introducing a law that you will not be registered a church will be registered if the pastor does not have the minimum qualification of a diploma in theology okay the believers i don't know any believer who has a diploma in theory that is preaching they don't so that means our churches are going to be illegal the same condition was in many pentecostal churches so what the pensacola churches did they all came together small and big church and they stormed in the attorney general's office the attorney general is the chief the chief justice or something like that and they said no we protest against that rule and they called a press conference and they said categorically if you pass that law we are going to mobilize all the christians in this country and they are going to vote this government out that rules was quietly shelved you call the believers to have a common thing today if they have a common threat may god help us that we don't have we don't get a common threat but to work together it's not something we are proud of something we are ashamed of the division the references we have the same message but you have so many differences why is it like that now i believe now let me just read this let me read this before i comment as i'm just about to finish i want to do this now yes disciples had no unity disciples had no unity they could not understand jesus they said ah who can understand these things see god wasn't in them yet amen can you believe that are you telling me these people moving with jesus hearing the word even preaching being going around and preaching and even healing the sick and everything else but here problem is saying god had not come in them yet and for that matter they had no unity about this they had no unity and that was because they had not yet obtained a portion of god in them that's why they could not have any unity now they could not understand jesus they said ah who can god wasn't to them they were just associated in fellowship could we be having association in fellowship but not a union are we only having an association of fellowship of believers all over the country all over the world but we don't have fellows we don't have the union they're walking with jesus they are preaching with jesus they are sleeping with jesus they are going around everything here and here we are told they were on having a a union of fellowship association of fellowship as was yet they were only associated in fellowship but not you united they were not one they just associated with him may god help us that it will be not yet just having associations and not union they were just as written in fellowship they just associated with him that many are good man today they didn't they didn't drink they didn't lie they didn't steal nothing but they didn't have that oneness of god didn't have it it wasn't there there were a bunch of believers they were together associated we are the japanese of christ they were persecuted executed together they were criticized together they were hated together they were they they traveled together they went everywhere together they stand together but they were not united they had only a kind of associated fellowship the union was not there okay they didn't do it they didn't lie they didn't steal they didn't have the oneness of god there wasn't one with god yet see they couldn't be or they done mila cost they cast up devils that's the earrings they didn't know that kind of things now then came pentecost god made them one again glory be to god when did they become one on the new pentecost why because a portion of god came upon each one of them and that made them one and made them united oh my then they they had oneness with god oneness of god what one was with god with them came on the day of pentacles god was in them now act if you are putting down acts 4 32 the bible says they were with one heart one soul and one might oh brother why they had become restored back to that origin again that one of adam and if that union that is the only condition that we can be one god first and then with one another amen in the name of the holy father you've got to be attached with god connected with god as an individual i am connected with god you are connected with god certain is connected with god and after we are connected with god individually then we are connected with each other [Music] how is it going to happen let us have the portion of god in our lives thank you jesus there's that portion of the holy ghost come in within us and then we are made one now i want you to just give a little proof here a little bit and then i close now number one to see how that brought that union forgive me for my slowness power had never seen peter are you following me paul had never seen who peter but the same holy ghost in that same union in that same union glory caused him to say the same thing have you received the holy ghost since you believed he said we don't know whether there be he said how was you baptized he said unto john said you have to be baptized over again in the name of jesus christ and they received the holy ghost what was it the union saying the same thing god says and that's the confession confess means to say the same thing and he's the high priest over confession that's right there you are peter and paul let me just read another another quote here that will expound that one maybe much more praise be to god union with god and with one another i will become united with one another but when paul that is prophetic sea that received the holy ghost i received the holy spirit when ananias baptized him and he went into arabia and studied for three years come back never consulted the church about anything for 14 years and when you come and met peter the head of the church at jerusalem they were eye to eye in doctrine why can't we be eye to eye in doctrine in this message what's wrong what's the problem there's a problem there are so many teachings and doctrines and people and whatever some people come they tell you we already raptured then you ask them what are you doing here when you are eating they are also eating how can you have the rapture and you are still eating just confusion some rise up they say we are the ones that i'm going to to preach the gospel in jerusalem i'm both elijah and and moses all of them in me then you have a following doctrine and doctrine and teachings and everything else in this message as long as we have only a fellowship just something of fellowship but not union but the time has come when we got to have that union and he went to libya and study for three years come back and never consulted the church about anything for 14 years and when he come and met peter the head of the church at jerusalem they were eye to eye in doctrine why why the same holy spirit we are peter baptized in the name of jesus christ paul did the same without anybody telling him where peter taught the baptism of the holy ghost and sanctification and so forth power did the same thing without consorting the child because it was the same guide [Music] this is the hour when we have got to have the same guide this is when you have got to have the same holy ghost this is how we are going to have the same uniting power in each one of us that brings a union that's the real and when we have that union with god then we have a union with one another and we teach the same doctrine i'm saying this morning it is possible to have the same doctrines you supposed to have no differences now let me cut short my message and then give this quote and then we close will it ever happen shall we live with this confusion let me first of all say something here i don't believe we shall be ruptured in this confusion no we cannot disrupt all together the way we are no god cannot take a church called bright that cannot be called upright on confusion division they are not in one heart they don't have one mind i believe the church that will be taken for the rapture will have the same union with god as adam and eve like it was there on the day on pentecost and they shall have a union with one another no differences in doctrines no difference in teachings just the same so what do you mean now what about all these people in the message that i share no different i believe either before the rapture comes god will change them or they will not be in rupture that's the only hope two things before that time comes contagious them if not that men are being left here with their own doctrines and teachings around here but the church that is going will be united we'll have a union why do i say that listen i'm trying to shorten it in the headstone and she'll be the supercharged a super race as she nears him there in the bride will be so much like him that he will even be in his very image go back to genesis adam and eve created in his image they shall be in his very image this is in order to be united with him the bride that is now shall be united with him this is the ultimate of this message the ultimate of this message is a church a people that are united with christ there is a portion of my messenger have left out about the word uniting not just the holy ghost that holy ghost after the holy ghost comes guides us to the whole truth and the holocaust was to do nothing else but to guide a child to the whole truth not some truth and that's what the holy ghost did to them and that brings them into that one unity okay as far as as she nears him there i there in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one that is the word of god there will be a very manifestation of the word of the living god amen okay another one here notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride remember i started the harmony between the husband and the wife which is a shadow of this harmony with goddess in church he shows us his world of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the word the water will raise it up again amen god is walking in a small bride towards that she will be that way the same condition like adam and eve god having a awareness with his family that is the ultimate of this message ms god bless you very much amen [Applause] let's pray heavenly father we look at your world and look at the conditions that we are living in and we find very embarrassing situations even in our people called by your name the people that have left the denominations and they have come to the message and the condition of divisions and separations that are there lord but lord we know from your world that there will be a bride that is very very united with you and united with one another that is our hope that's what we know it shall be and we believe it lord it shall be that way help us father that you may allow you to work us into that condition into that state continue to work in your church lord and bless your people have your father with us and bless us lord in every way commit ourselves to you in the name of jesus christ our lord amen amen may god bless you if i don't meet you again before i go back home i ask you to send me your greetings yes god bless you amen [Music] we appreciate that [Music] we appreciate that praise the lord amen i know when the preacher started with that marriage subject is just flamed the building i could feel the heat coming from behind me all the young people were connected to death that's wonderful praise the lord amen you know let me say this [Music] you know this promise that jesus made in john chapter 17. he says father make them one there will not be a man that would be able to achieve that just like the preacher said it would have to be god that we achieve it and because god made a promise no matter what we are seeing with our natural eyes no matter what the doctrine differences might be let's keep our eyes on christ you know one of the problem is that uh you know i i can go through a lot of things this morning but i think the message has already been preached i would not want to do a tag team this morning and come behind it but i believe we have we have got stuck in different areas it's just like eleazar going out to get rebecca as a bride she never knew isaac she never met isaac in her life all she knew about isaac was what eleazar told her but you see as the chair was getting closer and she could see a man in the field [Music] because every step of the way she will ask eliza where are we he will say we are in the efficient church age we are in the seminar church age in the philadelphia church age [Music] as it got to the peak of loud nature and she could see a man in the field even though she have not seen his face but because of so much of what eliezer has told her about isaac the moment that eleazar identified that that was isaac rebecca's attention left eleazar she loved this man for the way he wrote the chara she loved him for all the story that he told [Music] but when eleeza identified isaac just like john saying behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the word there were two disciples of john the baptist that left the revival that night and followed jesus because they got the revelation of what the message was the message was not the messenger the message was about the lamb of god that took away the sin of the world and just like i said the other day there are things that we grow out of the bride is surely going to grow out of this [Music] there are some childhood conditions when i was a child i talked like a child i walked like a child i thought like a child science proved to us that there are medical conditions that we can grow out of this word of god proved to us that they are fbi condition we will grow out of as we eat the word and we fought in love with jesus christ and we just love him and we just love him pretty soon we will rise above all of our differences let me ask you a question have you ever been so mad so indifferent with somebody and pretty soon you hear that person has lost someone close to them and you forget the indifference oh my goodness really really oh man she was such a nice woman all mine and that's just how it's going to be one of these days [Music] everything we think i have a stain i have a stain this is what i stand for those things does not matter to god they don't matter to god i believe that as this bride just fall in love with jesus and she just love the word and doing her best to represent him in this life they are human tendencies we would grow out of natural tendencies we would grow out of and one of these days we'll realize the only thing that mattered was the love that he had for us and have affected us with that love that we on water humans can be able to love him the same let's just worship him a little bit fine [Music] one [Music] by the world [Music] [Applause] [Music] make us want [Music] fine [Music] that you said [Music] now i wanted to say this thing just before we prayed and be dismissed you know the preacher started talking about marriage [Music] and the union and promises and all of those wonderful things that just trigger our heart we want to send a special congratulations to brother wesley and sister cara i think the the age married coupled among us over 50 years praise the lord brother scott and sister naomi nothing over 40 years better cassette and sister khalid over 30 years
