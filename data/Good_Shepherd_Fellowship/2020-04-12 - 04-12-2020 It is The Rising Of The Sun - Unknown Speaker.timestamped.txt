[4:41] but then I have the picture League
[4:45] present here if you noticed as Life
[4:48] magazine had it but I wonder if my
[4:53] audience visible your has ever really
[4:56] looked at the picture same thing anyway
[5:00] it should be
[5:02] you remember I was preaching when this
[5:05] vision came upon the subject of the book
[5:09] of the revelations were the old judges
[5:12] or we've seen Jesus and revelations one
[5:16] when we started to open the seven seals
[5:18] of the church ages brother just prior to
[5:22] the opening of the Seventh Seal Christ
[5:25] was standing with hair like wool white
[5:28] and I describe that to you that the old
[5:32] English judges and judges have long ago
[5:35] when they went to the bench to be sworn
[5:38] in their supreme authority was given
[5:40] them they wore a white wig as it was
[5:44] over their heads to show their supreme
[5:46] authority well if you'll turn the
[5:50] picture like this and look you probably
[5:52] sniffing the audience its Christ so your
[5:57] eyes looking here just as perfect as
[5:59] Ditka be wearing the white wig of
[6:02] supreme deity and judge of all heavens
[6:06] and earth can you see these eyes noses
[6:09] mouths just turn the picture from this
[6:11] great ahead it this way the way it's
[6:13] supposed to be and you can you see it
[6:17] his supreme judges not other but him and
[6:22] that is a perfect identification again
[6:27] of hven dication of this message is the
[6:30] truth
[6:34] making him not a third person but the
[6:37] only person was the white CC the dark
[6:41] his face is there in his eyes and notice
[6:44] he's looking from him comes this light
[6:47] shining on the right hand side to which
[6:50] is looking at you
[6:52] Krauss that's where he looked to the
[6:54] right or he part the center and the life
[6:59] of his resurrection we still go forth in
[7:02] his name I wish this morning that I had
[7:10] much time to say that all these
[7:14] phenomena that's beyond any shadow of
[7:17] doubt been proven for the past 30 years
[7:20] or 35 years right here at this church
[7:24] that's down on the river well that same
[7:26] light came down here in Jeffersonville
[7:28] in 1933 and spoke those words as john
[7:32] the baptist was sent to forerun the
[7:34] first coming of Christ
[7:36] you're a message before on the second
[7:38] we're at the end time and we see it we
[7:42] wonder sometimes why hasn't spread all
[7:44] over the earth maybe sometime we'll have
[7:48] a chance to explain that if God willing
[7:50] now I want you to turn him in your
[7:54] Bibles as we always believe that the
[7:57] word must come first of the reading of
[8:00] the word I always read that because if
[8:03] five words is the word of a man it will
[8:06] fail but the Word of God can never fail
[8:09] now we're going to read from the Holy
[8:15] Scriptures okay and we want you to turn
[8:18] first to three places in the Bible that
[8:25] I have chosen to read from one of them
[8:29] is in Revelation the first chapter and
[8:35] 17th and 18th verse this is where he
[8:41] appeared with his hair white as wool and
[8:46] his feet was like brass and then I want
[8:50] you also to get in your Bibles Romans
[8:53] 8:11 I've chosen this morning three
[8:58] places to read from the Holy Scriptures
[9:01] farma message today that the Lord has
[9:05] placed upon my heart for the
[9:06] resurrection and then I want you to also
[9:10] mark 16:1 and to there I will draw my my
[9:18] context now in revelation 1:18 we read
[9:24] these words a 17 and 18 and when I saw
[9:30] him I fell at his feet as dead and he
[9:35] laid his right hand upon me saying unto
[9:38] me fear not for I am the first and the
[9:43] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[9:48] and behold I am Alive for evermore amen
[9:52] and have the keys of death and hell and
[9:59] in Romans the eighth chapter and
[10:03] eleventh verse we read this but if the
[10:08] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[10:11] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[10:16] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[10:19] your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[10:23] grow up in you and now and Mark the 16th
[10:29] chapter a chapter of the resurrection
[10:33] the sixteen chapters the first and
[10:36] second verses and when the Sabbath
[10:42] repairs
[10:43] Mary Magdalene mother and Mary the
[10:49] mother of James and slowly has brought
[10:54] sweet spices that they might come and
[10:57] anoint him and very early in the morning
[11:00] the first day of the week they came unto
[11:05] the sepulchre at the rising of the Sun
[11:10] now my text this morning I want to take
[11:14] four
[11:16] it is the rising of the Sun and for a
[11:22] subject I want to use the quickening
[11:27] power now you know you perhaps have been
[11:35] hearing the radio and the different
[11:39] ministers speaking our noble brother
[11:42] Neville this morning speaking his Easter
[11:45] subject on the resurrection and I
[11:52] thought maybe I would take it a little
[11:55] different path not to be different but
[11:59] just to add a little more maybe in
[12:03] another angle for you just scriptures
[12:07] every angle you go with the scriptures
[12:10] it always declared Jesus Christ you
[12:15] cannot get away from it anyway
[12:17] they always declared him now as the
[12:21] world today in a memorial service or at
[12:28] least in the United States in this side
[12:30] of the earth this morning and the
[12:32] churches throughout are celebrating a
[12:36] memorial of the greatest triumph that
[12:41] man ever had I think as Savior when he
[12:47] died all as an infant when he was born
[12:52] he could not have been your left being
[12:54] coming into the earth and when he died
[12:58] shortly you thrown for our sins but yet
[13:03] there's been many fine little babies
[13:06] born and there's been many men who have
[13:11] suffered his dies or real cause but
[13:15] there never was one I could raise
[13:19] yourself up again until this day now
[13:23] that it is the greatest
[13:26] we can history the greatest celebration
[13:30] of all times this Easter is where he
[13:34] proved what he had said man can see
[13:39] things but yet it isn't exactly can be
[13:44] relieved of all clearly until it's been
[13:47] proved to be the truth and is God who
[13:51] said prove all things hold fast to that
[13:54] which is good he would not tell you to
[13:59] do something that he would not do insult
[14:01] so he proved who this was that died our
[14:09] sin and now not only is it a memorial T
[14:15] of all these great Easter flowers Easter
[14:20] bonnets and pink rabbits so forth that
[14:24] we've got attitude and holy celebration
[14:27] which is all right but this is not the
[14:32] real thing and that way as people today
[14:38] are trying to say we should wash the
[14:41] horse the year on Thursday on Friday we
[14:49] should take the communion and all
[14:51] different doctors they argue about
[14:54] whether it should be this day or that
[14:56] day which should be a Sabbath day or the
[14:58] first day of the week or all these
[15:00] things are just merely tradition that's
[15:06] good would any of it do you when you had
[15:09] lit or not limp if there's no life in
[15:13] you it's only of Memorial which is
[15:18] nothing against it but they have
[15:21] certainly carried out their traditions
[15:23] but let that the main thing Satan
[15:28] doesn't care how religious you are or
[15:31] how right you are in your
[15:33] doctoring is you miss that life your
[15:36] won't come up anyhow no matter how
[15:40] religious how good how many churches you
[15:43] belong to I will belong to it doesn't
[15:46] matter one thing unless you have been
[15:50] born again
[15:52] therefore if God raised up Jesus from
[15:56] the dead did he raise him up for a
[15:59] memorial and is this resurrection
[16:02] morning only up or watering in the year
[16:06] or certain day that we celebrate this
[16:08] all are we benefactors of his
[16:13] resurrection what does that mean to me
[16:17] what does it mean do you not we believe
[16:21] by faith that he raised from the dead
[16:24] but what has that got to do with me
[16:28] that was 2000 years ago now to find this
[16:33] text over-tired my arm hurting me from
[16:40] shock that the nurse gave me for leave
[16:44] overseas now as you know in a few days
[16:49] but heavy shops on and on and with
[16:54] colouring yellow fever and everything I
[16:56] was pretty weary making me sick
[16:59] which Caesar requires to have these
[17:02] shops before you go into the other
[17:04] nation and he said give Caesar that
[17:08] which is Caesars but then give God that
[17:11] which is God and I was sitting there
[17:15] wondering what would I speak to this
[17:19] waiting audience this morning which I'm
[17:22] very thankful for and man and women who
[17:26] would lay their life on the line for
[17:28] what you would say how should I do it
[17:32] what should I take for a tick
[17:36] and then model is sitting there all this
[17:39] but sleep
[17:41] my door rattled out on the front side of
[17:45] the house nobody being there but myself
[17:48] as far as I knew
[17:51] listen I didn't get it just right after
[17:55] a while this Dan room door Laura have
[17:58] turned into a steady hit rattle and
[18:02] someone kept shaking the door I went to
[18:06] the door opened the door and to my
[18:10] surprise a pretty little yellow haired
[18:15] blue-eyed girls just there
[18:18] look like a little Easter flower just
[18:20] sitting here look at me now
[18:23] she handed me a card and it was the
[18:30] course I guess when I get home they'll
[18:32] be Easter cards and so forth but the
[18:34] only one being leaving home that I'd
[18:37] received and she said brother branham
[18:43] this is from daddy and me Geor be sure
[18:48] that he was in it and her arthritic
[18:53] father sitting in a wheelchair and set
[18:58] this card when I took it in thank the
[19:03] little darling as she turned and walked
[19:08] away from the door opened up the card
[19:13] and in the farm of this card
[19:17] drew my picks for on the card was the
[19:22] st. mark 16:1 and to shut up
[19:28] the Sun was rising and then I thought of
[19:33] that and then the subject of the
[19:36] clipping of Jesus Christ to be raised up
[19:40] from the data through my subject now
[19:46] the Sun at this rising of the Sun well
[19:54] there was a time when the world was
[19:56] laying in the darkness it was without
[20:00] song and was gone and it was all covered
[20:06] with water and was laying there in the
[20:12] dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the
[20:19] Spirit of God moved upon that water and
[20:22] said let there be light
[20:26] God had a reason to do that for down
[20:31] beneath that water there were seeds that
[20:35] he implanted and it had the hair that
[20:40] the sunlight to make it live and the
[20:45] first light was ever given in the earth
[20:47] or God spoken word the first light it
[20:53] ever struck the earth was God's spoken
[20:55] word he said let there be light and
[20:59] there was light that turns darkness into
[21:03] ice in order to bring forth a creation
[21:07] of joy life upon the earth then the
[21:14] Spirit of God has it moved with love and
[21:16] compassion at that great day the first
[21:19] day of the dawn of creation upon the
[21:23] earth the Sun rose and swept across his
[21:27] grays and dried up the waters from the
[21:31] earth and made an atmosphere above at
[21:35] Floyds first time it was the brain
[21:37] joy-ann drive to the earth by a seed
[21:40] that was a great power but all it wasn't
[21:46] nothing that Sun I like the Sun Rise on
[21:49] that Easter morning this time with the
[21:54] Sun leaving into the sky
[21:57] it brought forth a greater sunrise and
[22:01] every because it came greater news with
[22:05] this son arrived then it did with the
[22:08] sunrise at the beginning this sunrise
[22:12] brought a news that He is risen he is
[22:19] quickened from the dead as he promised
[22:23] he's risen from the dead the first time
[22:29] the Sun rose in Genesis it was bringing
[22:33] a message that there will be life upon
[22:35] the earth more alive but this time when
[22:38] the Sun rose there was a new Sun rising
[22:44] another Sun rising it was it not only if
[22:48] you in rising it was a s all in had
[22:52] risen to bring eternal life to all God's
[22:57] promise see that by foreknowledge he'd
[23:02] seen laying upon the earth no hair could
[23:06] the bothy life live right there at the
[23:09] beginning without the S UN to bring it
[23:13] to life
[23:13] no hair that the day when sons of God is
[23:18] up on the earth it Victor s o in life to
[23:21] bring down to eternal life his chosen
[23:25] words that he knew before the foundation
[23:28] of the world he had chosen them in
[23:30] himself before the foundation of the
[23:33] world on Easter morning then in this
[23:37] dirt somewhere laid our bodies that that
[23:41] done or we are the dust of the earth and
[23:46] in living there was a book of memory and
[23:50] his attributes was in him nor anything
[23:53] there called this son of God raised it
[23:57] would also read the life every tongue
[24:00] that was for our date for this great
[24:02] time he knew it would be and
[24:07] alright that was that it was at the
[24:10] beginning at time when it first gone now
[24:15] on this great breaking all the easter
[24:18] seals now today we have a tuberculosis
[24:23] Easter seal people sans a message one to
[24:28] the other as you support this great fun
[24:34] or drive for the doctors and medical
[24:38] science to work upon something to retire
[24:43] to help the tuberculosis they are seal
[24:46] what we call an Easter seal when we send
[24:50] message one to another but when we
[24:52] receive the message that seal is broken
[24:56] because the seal is what got a message
[25:00] found on the inside and now the true
[25:04] Easter seal all this sunrise was broken
[25:09] and the secret of life after death was
[25:13] revealed before that time we didn't know
[25:18] the world grouped in darkness grouped
[25:24] around man
[25:26] suspicion berries was among man's heart
[25:30] tradition made up man worship idols they
[25:35] worshiped the Sun they worshiped all
[25:37] kinds of God and all kinds of people
[25:40] they claim they went into the grave and
[25:42] they stayed in the greatest but the real
[25:46] seal had been broken and one who once
[25:50] live as we live started we will not work
[25:54] risen from the dead
[25:57] morning never one like it in all the
[26:01] history of the world the secret was made
[26:04] known that he was both resurrection and
[26:07] the life
[26:09] and he said when he comes on that
[26:12] morning because I live you live also not
[26:17] only what he's a beneficiary of the
[26:20] resurrection
[26:21] but all those seeds that was resting in
[26:26] God's great promise what a benefactor of
[26:29] that resurrection to life because there
[26:32] because also that was the breaking of
[26:41] the seal because he was brought up so
[26:44] will everyone that in Christ he brought
[26:48] up with him this glorious sunrise God
[26:53] had proven are vindicated his word all
[26:57] the groups of doubt that have moved in
[27:01] people's lives particularly because here
[27:05] what he once live eat drink and
[27:08] fellowship with mankind that's it I have
[27:11] power to lay my life down I have power
[27:14] to raise it up again and now not only
[27:18] had he made the statement that he proved
[27:21] it to be the truth oh thing that is I'm
[27:27] sure this morning that even we believe
[27:31] it cannot cover him what a great thing
[27:36] that was the call he raised from the
[27:41] dead
[27:41] we all thought have already raised from
[27:46] there while we were in him notice now as
[27:53] the groom covered the earth and the
[27:55] seeds cannot live without the SU and
[27:58] derive and gloom and cover the earth and
[28:01] now the fon was risen and all was
[28:06] finished by this light as a spread
[28:08] across the nation to the people that he
[28:11] is not here but he has risen what a what
[28:15] a statement he had proved his words he
[28:19] had proved it be to be
[28:21] true or he had now conquered their hell
[28:27] and agree the Trinity of the devil
[28:30] this hell and agree or Satan is the
[28:35] author of death he is the center of hell
[28:40] and also degree and that were the
[28:44] Trinity of Satan being called by one
[28:49] thing that was depth depth he grew up
[28:52] the grave and being a sinner you go to
[28:53] hell all the big one thing the Trinity
[28:57] of Satan which was death that helped man
[29:01] in captivity all these years but now the
[29:05] true Trinity of God being one men
[29:10] identity Christ who was life and it
[29:13] broke the seal that conquered the enemy
[29:16] and rose up the one true and living God

[29:25] forevermore peasant keys of death and
[29:28] Hell God in one made man had wrought
[29:33] among us and conquered every enemy I
[29:37] haven't proved that the Trinity of Satan
[29:41] was conquered and at the Trinity of God
[29:43] was made Lord NORs only God power to
[29:47] bring life back together he was that
[29:50] Immanuel God had been manifested in the
