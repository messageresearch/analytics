amen I mean Jesus told the apostles say if you say to this mountain be moved and you believe it with all your heart amen and you don't doubt it it shall move amen and I know the mountain may be may not really be a physical Mountain but we have problems amen we have you know problems in our lives sicknesses amen we have so many things I was talking I think in Iowa amen and I said you know there are many many many problems that the devil has put on us believers until we forget Who We Are amen until we forget that we are Sons and Daughters of God until we forget that every Redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ died for is for us amen so we just be there like oh crying and begging and miserable and like confused people but I want you to know today that every promise in the Bible is yours amen I will just maybe read some few quotes here or the prophet says here as I was with Moses the prophet says here amen paragraph 46. as I was with Moses preaching sikistan the prophet says here oh how the church or to look this morning to find the spirit working amongst people if you want a church home where the spirit that raised Christ from the dead the holy spirit that will move amongst the people that the spirit that God is raising up in the last days to take the people over into the other land into their full promise of all the blessings of God and to their full commission that he gave all the promise their promises unto you and to your children as Israel sought for that Promised Land knowing that it was somewhere because there had been somebody there before so is the church we know that there is a land somewhere Hallelujah there is a land somewhere not a physical land but a spiritual life amen Hallelujah Hallelujah there is a land somewhere that we are fighting to go to to enter into and the promises of God amen like Joshua was promised the land flowing milk and honey praise God Amen the prophet says there is a power somewhere because there has been others over there we know that land lays beyond the river where we are headed towards this morning trying to go into that Promised Land amen are you going back from Islam the land flowing with the milk and honey where there is full Promises of God Amen where everything that Jesus Christ died before is yours and you have to play for it amen praise God amen then in the message perfect faith I'm just going to read some quotes amen yeah perfect faith the prophet tells us here oh perfect face perfect face paragraph 146. paragraph 146. are we there amen he says you are a Christian amen amen amen you have right to any Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for you it is already it is all yours is already paid before you just have to believe it not to imagine it but believe it and know that it's yours and you can possess it oh that's the Conquering faith amen amen then he talked about Jesus that he couldn't speak amen what he wanted why because the word was already in him and he knew that everything Hallelujah he was a heir to it praise God that's why he told the apostles if you say to this mountain amen without doubting amen you can receive what you say and this is the time where God is raising a people amen he wants us to come to that position well we can speak the word and the word comes to pass Hallelujah that's why president moves the fast fruits oh Hallelujah Hallelujah he became the first fruits in this generation to speak the word as a child of God a creator and say squiros appear there and he was meditating on Mark 11. amen verse 22 squirrels appear there and this cross appear praise God amen even different from Jesus who will have to have bread and break break it and not fly but speak the word and the word creates praise God amen is that what you are supposed to do Hallelujah Hallelujah daddy fish not God give you your life but I give you back your life Hallelujah I I believe you get what I'm trying to say yes sister happy I give you back your children praise God and those children came running melted down and started crying by the spoken word and today my brother my sister that's what God wants us to come to to speak the word and the word comes to pass amen why because we are Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah Hallelujah you know I was preaching somewhere I think around Ohio somewhere some and I I was bring that and saying that we are Sons and doors of God and if you are sons and those of God we are gods and you know the brother kind of stood up on I said have I said something wrong and it kind of stopped me but I said I'm quoting what the prophet says in the beginning there was a war and the world was with God and the Word was God and the Bible says and those who believed in that word he gave them power to be Sons and Daughters of God those who are not born by the will of man Hallelujah oh by the will of Flesh or the blood but by God hallelujah hallelujah so I Am Not a Human Being I am a god Hallelujah Hallelujah oh praise God praise God okay I will just maybe skip some things here luki knew that he pleased God he knew that there was nothing on his life God had already testified this is my beloved Son in whom I am all pleased hear him this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased well in at the day of his baptism I am pleased to make my Abode in here there is no condemnation to him at all when now when the same God comes to you amen to dwell in you and please to honor your word what a decision is hallelujah like in the days of Joshua what was Joseph's decision son stand still and he stood there amen what was Mother's decision he held his Stick Over the River like that then he called for it to open and it opened see whatever you ask and if you say to this mountain be moved and you don't doubt see in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you have said that puts you back in the world Hallelujah in the beginning there was a word and the one with the God and the what was God so if he puts you back in the world you are the word made manifest in this day [Music] hallelujah oh praise God see it puts you back into the word do you believe that praise God all right all right all right let us go to another another message here talking uh Shriver port a paragraph 152 paragraph 152 are we there amen the prophet says here in the paragraph 152 God is Everlasting Italian it is eternal life by the Eternal of God and anything that at the beginning has an end and everything at the beginning besides God and God is the only form of eternal life there is and when God blesses him he is Holy Spirit in you which is God and when God blesses himself within you you are as Eternal as God is Hallelujah so we are Eternal beings amen we come from heaven and we are going back to heaven we come here to manifest who the sons of God are Hallelujah Hallelujah even the devil didn't know who Jesus was a man he he the only way for him to know who Jesus was was to try him a man to know whether I can do what God can do that's what he said if you are a son of God turn the Stones become bread huh why because it is only God who can turn stones to breath Hallelujah if you be a Son of God turn the Stones become red now Jesus could have done it because he was God [Music] but because it was a devil telling him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so even today the devil is wanting to know who the sons of God are amen that's why sometimes you come through trials he threw this he wants to know whether you are a son or a daughter of God amen amen because he knows the children of God will act like God they will talk like God they will walk like God hallelujah hallelujah there is a love like a God let me forgive you like a God hallelujah they only dressed like that you know of God Amen [Applause] like if you are father amen amen so the devil want to come to know amen Who You Are amen especially in this evil age praise God he comes to know are you the son of God are you only the daughter of God amen amen but if you're a doubt of God you will stand by the word because the word is already in you and this is the time of the manifestation of the sons of God how are you going to manifest a son of God how are you going to manifest the daughter of God in this hour Hallelujah Hallelujah by manifesting the word of your day brother Brahm says that we cannot manifest the the word of Noah's time we cannot manifest the word of Moses time we cannot manifest the word of Luther's time we are to manifest the word of this hour Edge hallelujah hallelujah when the world has become so crazy homosexuals everywhere lesbians everywhere Hallelujah but they are sons of God who will manifest the word of God amen amen amen so I believe I'm speaking to supernatural beings amen amen so and when God places himself within you you are as Eternal as God is because you are a part of him because you become a son or a daughter of God and you are displaying his word amen amen hallelujah then the prophet says I feel religious that is true God identifies himself you have got eternal life and that's God in you and this word is God hallelujah and that word lives and produces itself just exactly what God has ordained for this age you have it amen the Holocaust the holy spirit being displayed yes sir what is it the Holy Spirit the word has been quickened to you by the Holy Spirit to vindicate this age that you have passed from death and to life amen and now you are his All Because He Is We have the right to all that he has purchased for us amen every promise in the Bible is yours it belongs to you when this token is upon you and God has filled you now we want to check ourselves just for a moment when God has given you the Proverbs of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you that is true and every Theologian will have to admit that to be true yes sir is the new birth you are born and knew of the Holy Ghost and because that God has done this and you you know you are no good in yourself and you accept what God has done then he still shooting in his kingdom by the spirit and everything that Jesus purchased and promised in the Bible is yours Hallelujah everything that Jesus Promised in the Bible is mine Hallelujah it is your property because it is repaired before then it says amen life is mine he paid for it life is yours he paid for it healing his mind he paid for it healing is yours he paid for it Hallelujah so there is no need for you as a Believer Hallelujah to be crying oh I'm saying no no no God say promise kill him for the promise Hallelujah that's what the Bible says if there is anybody sick Hallelujah call the Elders of the church Hallelujah they lay hands on you and they sick shall recover amen it's your promise praise God Hallelujah freedom is mine he paid for it Even Heaven Is Mine I don't sit down to I I don't know maybe I'll go to heaven No Heaven Is Mine amen Heaven is mine he paid for it he hasn't paid the price everything he purchase belongs the man that's on the talking amen praise God Hallelujah do you believe that do you believe that I believe it every promise in the Bible is mine are you we used to sing that song every promise in the Bible is bad Hallelujah so today if there is anything that you want from the Lord you claim for it healing is mine Deliverance is mine Victor is mine Joy is mine hallelujah oh Hallelujah there is nothing nothing that can hold you down amen praise God the only thing is you have to speak the word amen because everything that Jesus Christ died for is mine is yours Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah every Redemptive blessing that's Jesus Christ died for his mind and it is now me to go back and find out which which redempt blessing do I need amen and I go and claim for it amen amen and somewhere brother Brown says you know what though God had given a promise to the tune of Israel to go and possess the land yes yes amen but they had to fight for every age amen they have to fight for everything and God a man has given us all their promises of Deliverance of healing of all the things but we just have to fight for them killing for it amen clear for your healing clear for your deliverance clear for your children amen don't just roll down my children are vaccine no no no clay for them Hallelujah claim for them for your relatives clear for your wife clear for your husband amen those are all our Redemptive blessings amen praise God amen do you believe that all right let us go to another Court here I hope you're not going to get tired of me giving quotes yeah I love what the prophet says conflict paragraph 106. conflict between God and Satan amen the prophet says that message says the word is eternal and if God made a promise that is eternal and there is nothing no way I can stop it amen they couldn't turn every atom upside down and turn it backwards could never pierce the word of God one little word see because Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail see that is the best whip on there is it is the word of the Eternal God was the one of God the word of God is God himself amen so God gave the believer himself praise God amen the word of God is God himself Hallelujah so every promise that God has given us is himself so he gave us himself amen it is God himself he gave the believer himself to attack the Enemy by in other words he is the father and the word is God then the word is our father we are born by the word and is standing in the front in the Forefront for his children amen there you are he is starving out there for his children what are we scared about Hallelujah let us push the world ahead of us amen and the one will speak for us the one will fight for us the word will provide for us because that's God himself amen amen amen we should not be scared of anything that's the Rapture is sure the coming is a sure every blessing that's been promised is ours and all belongs to us Hallelujah so we should not slack down amen I want us Brethren to go back to every promise of God amen any redempt to Blessings you claim for it praise God in the church age book are we together amen the prophet says here amen amen amen praise God amen just a word of encouragement to give us more faith he says here don't fear John don't fear a little of luck all that I am you are here too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use Hallelujah was given to Jesus and he says it is you as to use praise God it is yours to use Hallelujah you speak the word and I will perform that is my Covenant and it can never fail Hallelujah just speak the word Mountain be moved you keep quiet Hallelujah and God himself will move the mountain amen speak the word amen he told Joshua why cry I mean Moses why Christ speak you speak the word so today we as Believers we need to speak the word amen don't cry don't do no no no speak the word amen amen when a brother is in need speak the word speak now amen hallelujah that's why uh Samuel brother saying you know what we speak we should be very careful amen because you are a son and a daughter of God amen what you speak must come to pass Allelujah so don't call your your children Ricky's don't call them know These Foolish children bad children what are you creating bad children amen because you are a creator when you speak it comes to pass amen I always tell the church at home say if you know you are husband is back you just keep saying he's good my husband is good my husband is great what are you doing you are creating goodness your husband you are a Creator hallelujah oh my wife is wonderful my wife is a god oh the devil might try to show you other things but you say she's wonderful she is a great woman she's a powerful woman she's a wonderful woman you are creating speak the word and he will perform it Hallelujah Hallelujah speak the word amen speak the word about your children speak the word about your pasta speak the word about your deacons amen pick the one amen amen don't speak negative things no speak the word praise God Hallelujah amen that is my Covenant and it can never what a promise it can never fail amen I just want to to almost finish uh another quote here are we together all right your Prophet says here amen there it is again Jesus the name is the word amen well you can't separate God under what they are one nothing this word he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word was life amen John chapter 6. I mean but that is exactly what he is John Chapter 14 verse 6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans chapter 8 verse 9 If any man have not the spirit of Christ then he is not of his he is the spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the one so when our spirit born Spirit fill the man in effect takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as David speaking praise God [Applause] Hallelujah it is just us God himself speaking Hallelujah Hallelujah Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man because it will be God himself speaking amen I love that praise God Hallelujah so brethren I just want to encourage you that every promise in the Bible every Redemptive blessings that Jesus Christ died before is yours and you have a right to claim for tell the devil take away your hand from this this belongs to me Hallelujah take off your fingers and he will obey amen another quote here today I just want to read many foresee amen amen the message they're talking the talking the message they're talking they're talking paragraph 178 amen amen so we are creators whatsoever you want the Bible says ask and shall be given and you know there is a time when you just told the apostles he have not even asked all this time and you know I was telling the cat somewhere I say you see sometimes we come to church even if it's a prayer meeting people don't pray they don't come with a with a need to pray no amen they don't they don't come with the needs to pray but you have to come to God with a need like Anna she had a need she had a body amen and she got the desire of her heart paragraph on 78 amen and in him is all the fullness in him he's all the fullness of God all the fullness of the promises when we are baptizing to him we have every promise that God made a man is just laid at our finger finger fingertips amen no sin is there nor death is there and even sickness can stay in his presence if Santa then puts his hands to you and tries to tempt you into something you all you are talking in your hands and show it that you are a redeemed product of Jesus Christ I am a product that Jesus Christ bought amen and sickness fleece Hallelujah problems illustration fleece because you are redeemed you are a child of God Hallelujah Hallelujah I know today we have so many needs samasi some have problems at home and I believe God wants you to build some Faith light amen amen amen all right so let me just give this one or two course and then be close paragraph 155 perfect faith amen he says and now we become Anointed with that same spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs of the last day to shine forth that resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he is in his people moving among his bride with love affair to her pouring out he into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestations now the only thing that is going to manifest us as Sons and Daughters of God is when we can speak like God amen amen is when we can create like a god amen that's when even all the creation will know we are the sons and daughters of God amen I believe that today when brother Branham praying for that fish and say little fish I give you back your life no [Music] it is swam away to go and tell other fish they are sons of God in this world today Hallelujah When you pray for the opposite amen the prophet says after he prayed for the office of the opposite of Gaza these kids Hallelujah and he walked back to go and tell other animals amen that's all Hallelujah they are sons of God amen I was about to die but the Son of God gave me back my life amen amen manifested sons of God they will have the life of God in them amen they will talk like God they'll walk like a god they'll behave like God Amen because their sons and daughters of God amen the the life of God will be manifested in the Believers in the chin of God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah amen amen amen I was I was I always tell people you know a revelation when you say I have a revelation yes what's a revelation a revelation is a manifestation of the character of the father or of the blood of the father in the son amen of the blood of the father in the son is a revelation amen that's why by by Revelation Abel went and got the lamb because it was in the character of the father to slay lamps and the Bible says God had slain the lamp before they formation the one Hallelujah and they are Abel just came to manifest the character of the father is that right is that right that's a revelation amen amen oh Hallelujah you will act like your father you will behave like your father because the blood of your father is in you amen amen I was talking to brother Ben I think at the same thing like God loving uh uh with that Pro the Angel Michael amen Lucifer amen then he loved Abel instead of K is that right and when Abram comes He blesses Isaac instead of the firstborn who is that one Ishmael is that right and then when our Isaac was going to bless instead of blessing He blesses Jacob amen and and when Joseph was bringing the children to to Jacob to bless amen he closes the hands Hallelujah and that's what exactly what Jesus Christ did on the cross Hallelujah instead of blessing the Jews He blesses at the Gentiles the character of their father Hallelujah amen do you think that Abraham told Isaac that when you go together you tell him that he this one is your sister no Hallelujah but the Bible says when Isaac also went to get on he told them this is my sister exactly the character of the father exactly Hallelujah so if God is your father and the blood of your father is in you Hallelujah you will act like your father you will talk like your father you will be held like your father and if God is our father oh Hallelujah amen amen you see Jesus told me the Pharisees because the Pharisees thought that God was their father amen and Jesus told him if God was there your father you do you will believe this word amen because God is the one amen you will have the same character but you are of your father and he said even his works you do he was he was a non-deliver he was at the downtown he was a murderer from the beginning so they have the character of their amen so we have the character of Allah we talk like our s we behave like our we heal like our we clear like our praise God Hallelujah amen amen amen amen but we can only do that when we have completely separated that's where the problem is amen amen God wants total separation from unbelief from the things of the world Hallelujah be separated from them then God can speak through you God can create through you God can do everything through you amen amen the prophet says I'm just going to finish now just let me just read some few chords a man in a message total of separation see that's why we with we try to do this understand the other but there is something that is hindering amen amen but every promise in the Bible is yours amen amen amen amen let me guess we do this few chords and they and the prophet says here oh my is my time going up can I have some more 10 minutes all right okay God's word calls for inspiration the prophet says in paragraph 20 paragraph 20 the prophet says here Jesus has constantly told us that there is a separation and we find that the last thing that's predicted to the human race before the great final day when we Ascend into the praise of God there will be a final separation he will separate the ship from the gods amen and God will continually has been separating separating and that's that's what he's doing tonight that's what he always does you can see it every meeting he separates Faith from unbelief amen he speaks out he declares himself for those who believe Amen to those who him and have faith in him [Music] amen so for us to completely amen be able to speak that mountain Hallelujah we must completely separate amen and that's why you see when God had told Abraham amen oh I've given you the love I've given you everything I've given you every promise amen but Lord was with him he's the father was with him and uh and I I think other people were with him and the Bible says there was always amen until Abraham could not achieve what he wanted and the Bible says when Abraham after separating from Lord is when God comes down and God no tell Abraham now you separate from Lord yourself no he just keeps quiet after Abraham separating from Lord can we read the scripture beat Genesis chapter 13. Genesis chapter 13 let us read it 13. in verse 14. maybe start from verse 13 but the men of sort of were Wicked and he's seen us before the Lord exceedingly and the Lord said Anthony Brown after that Lord was separated from him Hallelujah after Lord are separated from Abraham now lift up now thine eyes I look from the place where thou art northward and Southward and Eastward in Westward for all the land which thou says today will I give it unto thy seed after thee and I'll make thy sin as the dust of the earth so that if a man can nominee that's all the Earth then shall thy seed also be alive walk through the land in the length of it and in the breath of it for I will give it unto thee praise God amen amen after Lord are the separated from Abraham after you have separated from the things of the world Hallelujah from unbelievers amen from anything that is contrast to the word of God Hallelujah then you can look North to South look West every promise is mine Hallelujah Hallelujah so many of us have not fully received our Redemptive blessings I repeat many of us have not fully received our redempted blessings for lack of total separation from the world and from unbelief amen amen because we need to separate total separation that's what God is demanding are we together all together so if there's been something that you have been praying for claiming and you don't receive it look back and see have I completely separated right is there something that is still on me amen amen is there any condemnation in my life Hallelujah because if there is condemnation in your life then you cannot receive God wants total separation total separation amen amen let us read that quote again amen amen amen so we have to start our lives such our work see whether it is with the word of God amen amen paragraph 27 says paragraph 27 the prophet says here I believe that tonight that every man and woman every boy and God that's born of the spirit of God is another right hand to the Lord because they have separated from the things themselves from the cancer of the world and whatever the world has got to say amen is that right you become another right separated for the cause of the of the word amen he says in paragraph 68 Abram also he was separated person from the world when God collaborate at 75 years old separate yourself from your Kindred and from all of the unbelief and come unto and a world that you have never worked in before amongst the people that you have never known before come out and separate yourself from anybody that would be contrary to what you are believing that you will be another right and the Lord because he was holding a promise amen Abram was holding a promise of a son and for him to receive that son he had to separate himself praise God he had to separate from his father he's a mother from all his children and what separated him not because that he was a good man but because he believed that God was able to keep the promise he had given him praise God praise God Hallelujah and then the message from that time from that time amen from that time from that time paragraph 58 the prophet says here paragraph 68 paragraph 58 rather not 68 58. amen and amen Abram was changed and look when a man meets God God called Abraham and he told him he wanted him to separate himself from all of his unbelieving Kindred and when God calls a man to work for him he calls you from Total Annihilation from all the things of the world and the sins of the Earth separation God never did bless Abraham till he fully Obed him he took his father the old man was always a hair in the soup excuse that expression but he was always wrong and Abraham and then he got Lord and then he finally went down there and after Lord separated himself then God said to Abraham rise up and walk through the land I have give it all to you it is all you are seeing he never fully blessed him till Abraham fully out together annually never be able to get anything from God and have favor with the God my brothers and sisters wherever you are until we fully obey the word of God you make yourself miserable by just half-heartedly approaching it amen amen if you don't completely surrender and separate yourself from the one you will not get anything from the Lord you're not getting anything from the Lord the last quote the last court Jehovah Jireh and then we shall close Hallelujah paragraph 56. I always don't quote so much like that but sometimes the speed leads me to court paragraph 56 says Jehovah Jireh pushing 64. April paragraph 56 says Hallelujah do you love him amen says now total separation from all unbelief and remember Abraham the patriarch was never absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what God Said do and we will never never never be blessed amen that's the prophet I repeat again now total separation from all unbelief and remember Abraham the patriarch who was never absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what God Said do and we will never never be blessed anyway and have the blessings until we obey what Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah all the Redemptive blessings are mine everything that Jesus Christ died for his healing is Deliver Us is Victory is Joy is Heaven Is Mine Rapture is mine Resurrection is might the change of the body is mine Hallelujah but but I must completely separate from the world from unbelief from anything that is controlled the word of God do you believe that amen amen everything that Jesus Christ died for is yours we have a night to Everest them to Blessings and today as we are going to end the service I know we have different needs I may not call the prayer line but I believe God is here with us amen amen every need that we need God is more than able for granted amen I've seen God do Mighty things I was seeing the sick being healed I've seen many people coming back to their minds Hallelujah praise God Hallelujah I have seen badly women amen receiving children I think I've prayed for other I would count more maybe over 10 10 women modern women Hallelujah and they receive children maybe some may be producing only boys and they want guns I've spoken not even pray but just speaking the word and say sister the next pregnancy is going to be a ball amen maybe she wants a girl I said sister next pregnancy you're going to get a girl and they have received them so what's your need tonight amen we have different needs we have different needs as we stand up I want you to hold your need raise up your hand tell God your need I may not lay hands on you because of the time but maybe if you are near brother you can just lay hands he is God and his word is eternal and that word which is eternal is now in US as the prophet says then we become Eternal as God is eternal and we being the sons and Daughters of God we are hairs together with Christ Jesus we are hairs to every promise of God to answer them to blessing of God of God we are here Abraham says it doesn't matter if you are a son and you are lame or whatever you are you are a hair it doesn't matter whether you're blind it doesn't matter what you oh what you look
