Lord bless you you may have your seat if uh if the if the uh let's let's first turn to Malachi chapter 4 then we will go to our PowerPoint and in that way I think I I have uh I have uh I think I have the rest of the scripture up there so Malachi chapter 4 then we will go to our PowerPoint praise the Lord for some reason uh these few days I've been I've been kind of for looking at end time prophecy and uh and uh I mean not not to not to uh uh the reason there is because uh I believe that we are following fulfilled scriptures amen and there are a lot of uh uh uh prophecy a lot of scriptures in the in the word that has uh that has been fulfilled in our day in the Major Way in a major way and uh uh as we as we talk we are talking on our last last series of uh in the beginning if you remember where we started uh uh since the beginning of the year we we we trying to deal with the last portion of it but this this uh caught my mind so I'm trying to bring it into this let's go to Malachi chapter 4 we will read verse one Malachi 4:1 for behold the day cometh there shall burn as an oven let's see the setting of that scripture a day that come that burn as an oven when an oven Burns it burns amen an oven your oven at home supposed to bake now Burn yeah if it burn it brings your house down praise the Lord amen amen so the day cometh there shall burn as an oven in all the proud yeah all that do wickly shall be stubbled they shall be just like wood put into the fire that what it means and the day that cometh shall burn them up said the Lord of hosts that a they shall leave them neither root nor branches so everything going to be burned with now this give us an idea that this is speaking about some kind of uh either total judgment final judgment you know where everything is going to be burned even to the root are we together amen but let's look at the next verse but unto you is there a you in the house this morning praise the Lord are you are you identified with that but unto you unto you that fear my name praise the Lord unto you that fear my name and like I said the the tear commandment don't take the name of the Lord in vain it is not just calling his name his name is is uh is is is a kind of for ambassadorship the ambassador of America to any country takes the name of their country amen he takes the name of America to that country so taking on his name that's why we take on his name in baptism praise the Lord am Paul said whatsoever we do in words or days we must do it in his name praise the Lord hallelujah all them that take on the name of Christ Paul said to Timothy will suffer persecution so we we have take on his name and and here Malachi is saying but unto you there fear my name shall the son of righteousness the son of righteousness the son of righteousness shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wing wings amen his two wings now uh the the the prophet Y is using the Su n and there in the Bible this is put in the in in in in the capital the son of righteousness I was I was thinking on this arise with healing in his wing praise the Lord amen now so you will realize that uh you go back to the Book of Joshua you remember one time when Joshua was in a battle in all and the battle was was was uh uh was tense he needed to finish that battle praise the Lord so what did he do Joshua says the son should stand still son stand still until I'm done with this battle God praise the Lord and the son stood still are we together amen now uh uh the prophet Malachi yet is saying but unto you that fear my name in this time in this in this time of judgment in this time word the the whole world is going to come to a place just like an oven to be burned and everything right in that same uh period of time to them that fear my name to you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness that same son that stood over uh uh aelon for Joshua to win his battle that same son is going to rise again praise the Lord amen amen he's going to rise this time with healing God in his wings praise the Lord are we together to them that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth the ones that have H experienced the raid of this Sunshine the ones that have experienced this healing in the wains from the son of righteousness you will go forth praise the Lord amen you will go forth and grow up as a stall in the as a calf in the stall sorry and ye shall treay down now there are there are four things I want you to watch here I think that's what that is on my mind I'm I'm getting excited so uh when I start stumbling then I'm getting excited amen my words are jumping over one another in my mouth now so so Malachi is saying here to you that fear my name the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings and you will go forth not only that but you will also grow up as a cal in the star now only that but you will tread down I want for us to look at the four of them you will tread down the wicked for they shall be arches under the sword of your feet in the days that I shall do this said the Lord of hosts now the reason why I'm taking the scripture is is the promise of healing because uh uh John have said that uh uh uh uh uh above all things you wish that we prosper in health even as our soul prospereth amen so we are talking on our last beginning series walking in health as it was in the beginning like we saw on Wednesday night Adam walked in health when God created him he was a healthy man praise the Lord he was was healthy in his body he was healthy in his mind so much healthy that he didn't even knew he was naked his mind was not corrupted it was not polluted his Spirit was healthy he was so much healthy that he could speak the the right thing he could say I call you lion and God say I'm pleased with that how much health can you compare to that you know when we were singing a song uh uh peace of God cover me I was thinking about that that's what the song came to my mind as we are talking on on this subject now uh uh uh and and and what I was thinking about is the scripture talks about the peace that passes all understanding what is that what is it the peace that passes all understanding what is it have you ever thought about it what what is this pieace that passes all understanding it's above your understanding you can't understand it but it's real it's there don't don't try to explain it to me the scripture say it pass your understanding the peace that passes all understanding praise the Lord if it pass my understanding I won't understand it but it's there it's real praise the Lord amen the peace that passes all understanding all understanding it's a promise of experiencing peace when even you don't understand it when it don't even make sense are we together I was thinking about that last night what I was studying and and and just like I said to you I said to myself I said my friend the scripture say it pass all understanding don't don't lose sleep over this praise the Lord it pass all understanding don't lose sleep over this but it's real praise the Lord is real that God can give you peace you can have peace even in the midst of trouble that God can give you peace you can be able to have peace when it don't even make sense why you lost your loved one yes you can understand year but you can have peace here yes yeah praise the Lord you see peace is not something that you can understand peace is something that you experience praise the Lord like someone said you cannot preach love you can't preach love and explain love you know to love one another no no no love is something that that you must live that's right praise the Lord that you must live for God so loved the word to express his love he did not bring us anopia to explain it for him to show her what love is he took on flesh he took a body and he came down to show us what love is that I can make you and I can die for you praise the Lord the peace that passes all understanding so as we continue in our uh if our technician will put our slides up as we continue in our uh uh beginning series we want to talk on the Sun of righteousness walking in in healing as in the beginning Above All I Want You to prosper in health even as your soul Prosper it so it is the last part of that beginning series we want to see that in the beginning Adam walked in healing the Bible say Enoch walk walked with God and he was not praise the Lord amen a man that walk with God is a healthy man for a man to be walking with God until his feet will be light and he will defy gravity and he will be Rapture praise the Lord amen that's that's that's uh I mean that's uh that's that's Health that's healing so we talking about the son of righteousness we want want to look at that promise God promised that the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings you know I talk about this you know what what this is this is the promise of the restoration of Health to take us back to Eden right because this promise is coming right at the close of time right when God is saying I'm going to burn everything I'm going to destroy everything but to you that fear my name I'm going to bring you back to to health that you can get back to Eden you can experience the healing that you lost by the Fall this is God's promise of restoring health what health is praise the Lord amen I was uh I was following my good friend yesterday brother brother VY Livingstone in uh South Africa woke up in the morning and and I was looking at something on my phone and and uh they were having a memorial service for a young sister that that went to be with the Lord and uh uh young lady and her husband there uh from Zimbabwe that is part of their Church uh she had I mean it was according to the the testimony he called me back later in the evening and uh she was she was sick not not feeling well I mean not not down Sick and uh took her to the hospital and he realized that uh you know her heart was not uh there was a problem with her heart and then took her to another place and you know this was Thursday Friday uh uh yeah Wednesday Thursday Friday then she you going to be with the Lord so and uh so they had a call uh a very you know uh uh uh Quake uh memorial service and just in one sense just to inform the church and to pray for the family and then before they start making preparation and I told him in the evening I says that that was very unique you know that was that was very unique I know my friend in uh in Ghana and also U afred Davidson he also so does that when someone pass you know gather the things together and uh and then they prayed and and then before they start going about preparing of everything but while I was listening to him he was he was speaking and something he said he read that quota you know where the messenger said uh uh every time your heartbeat you are getting close to that place praise the Lord amen every heartbeat is is close to that place every heartbeat brings you closer to death every heartbeat brings you closer to go and meet your maker that's what it is praise the Lord and uh and and and it was it was very it was very unique uh you know uh uh and I and I think it was it was beautiful so as as we want to look at this subject this morning just like I'm saying is that uh uh we are we are looking at uh uh a promise we are looking at a promise this is a promise I I'm I'm I'm I'm praying and hoping that the Holy Spirit can help us to be able to see it this morning this is a promise of the restoration of Health for the millennium and for eternity praise the Lord this is a promise as as we look in the subject you will realize why why uh uh uh Divine Healing Ministry it took a set pick praise the Lord amen and and and and and if you see around the the chrisom uh uh uh most of our our uh our our our mega church if if they are not allowing the people to live anyhow dress any how you know believe anything they are majoring on healing praise the Lord why because whenever God moves the devil also move it's with every Revival whenever he sees the move of God he makes a counterfeit praise the Lord I remember many years back uh uh uh over in the aost I had a good friend uh uh there Pastor innocent one time he invited me to preach on his Crusade and uh you know I spoke for him and and uh uh we we had a good time and then after couple of months he came to see me you know uh uh or he sent for me I went to see him and he's you know he says wow that was you know good you know we talk a little bit he asked me you know uh uh you know to have a little idea of uh you know what I believe where I was in the scripture so I try to share a little bit with him so he told me he says uh you know both of us we can work together I see that you have a salvation Ministry I have a Healing Ministry praise the Lord in my mind I'm thinking I'm I'm saying see that's a dual atonement but you can break it you can only preach salvation without healing you can preach healing without salvation you can't take one and leave the other but you see we are living in a day where you find uh H H all sorts of healing people o around why why is it that we are living also in a time where Medical Science has improve in history like never in the world why because the son of righteousness Rose the son of righteousness Rose and and and all they are doing is that they are just benefiting from the ren right praise the Lord because when a son Rose it was not just only to bring healing to your body but to bring healing to your soul when your soul is healed your body is restored praise the Lord amen a person should just have headache and pray and God heal their headache Qui they have become a uh you know they have the gift of healing praise the Lord the gift of healing is is for everybody it's for every child of God praise the lord we must teach our children there tell them you are sick pray pray God will heal you ask God to heal you why why are we having it and and and we and and and and and and and and in the name of that the church have created a lot of atrocities these people with Healing Ministry go off the word whatever they are using I don't care whatever they are using what I care about is that they are using the name of the Lord in vain praise the Lord amen because if you will be professing to heal people and then yet you be abusing them amen are we together but but but why what I'm trying to bring to you what I want you to see is there it is happening because a promise has been raising a promise of the son of righteousness that will rise with healing in his wings has been fulfilled this son has raisen over Us Praise the Lord we wouldn't have advanced in medical science if we did not have this promise praise the Lord amen I mean Medical Science has has has I mean has has has risen to such a place and all they are thinking and and and all they are believing is is uh their smartness has brought them to that place no it's not their smartness is because a blessing rose up in the earth and like the scripture says the the the the the how do the Bible says the sun rise on the just and the unel that's what the scripture says the sun rises on on the just and the unjust when God Rises a blessing as the sun rises the just benefit from it they unjust benefit from it until science have medical science have gone in into such a place with this AI technology that they are they they are they are building a bunch of artif future uh uh uh warm praise the Lord artificial warm and they can go over to uh uh over to a sper bank and produce hundreds of children that's the world we are living in Praise the Lord amen China will never lost population it's not funny it's real it's real they will never lost population why because long time they broke into that technology these are facts it's not it's not a mind makeup I'm not just picking something over my head that's what medical science is there's a big lawsuit now that is that is over around the us where the people that have donated to uh uh uh the the the I the Spring Bank uh you know uh uh uh has realized that uh you know what Their donation has given them over 50 Children why because with all of these DNA uh I mean uh ancestr.com a child want to find out where they are coming from they realize that oh I have a sister living down the road oh there is another sister in California oh there is said not before they realize they are 50 it's not funny it's a reality it's a reality that you are living with it's happening in your time this is not a fiction story but I'm also trying to show you the reason why signs have been able to arrive to this place is because of this promise amen praise the lord it's because of this promise when when when Daniel said knowledge shall increase amen Daniel hon inspiration said knowledge shall increase Daniel never said they will make atomic bombs he only said knowledge shall increase amen he never said you will get Tesla a car that can drive by itself or you will get a not only a car now they even they are even making a semi truck Tesla have just puted out their semi truck that can drive across the entire country without a driver in it when Daniel said knowledge shall increase he never said that's what will happen but when knowledge increases what brother brandham said he says it explode like a rocket and it breaks up it breaks up and and all the industry of men benefit from it science benefit from it the technology World benefit from it the security World benefit from it the drug laws benefit from it the the the rubbers benefit from it the teeth benefit from it praise the Lord amen knowledge shall increase is the increase of knowledge that make people to sit down in India and be calling you on your phone to break into your bank account oh because it's your bank account now serious because it's your bank account now it's very serious the other one was funny but it one we got to we got to wash out now our bank account I don't want anybody breaking into my bank account but when Daniel said knowledge shall increase he never says inan scammers will be scamming you he never said it but scammers are tapping into that they can spend hundreds and thousands of hours on the on the net sleepless night just putting in different different Cults and just I mean they they are just hoping that you know it's it's it's almost just like somebody going to the gas station every morning and trying to buy Power Board hoping that it will be able to to make the millions praise the Lord that's the same way somebody just sitting down sitting down on their computer hoping that I will be able to break into some kind of a h h uh uh rich man account praise the Lord when they come to mind is overdrive this guy is p this guy is p praise the Lord you love the Lord amen don't don't make your account go over dry please that's not what I'm preaching but I'm trying to show you that a major promise has visited the Earth it was almost like when bam said he said the star of Jacob shall rise it was the very same star that the wise men saw praise the Lord that star came over Jerusalem and the religious people never see it right three men travel two years following a star that was written right in the Torah and people are in the Singas every Sunday reading from the Torah reading from their Bible and they did not know that a promise has been fulfilled in their day and those men God there where is he born King of the Jews they say the only King we have is Herold praise the Lord they took they took the wise men to Hera Palace he's he's our King he's the king of the Jews that we know says no no no no this one we saw his star in the east so Herod now have to send for the sedran council send for members sit down here look this God is talking something that he saw a St that you people that you're the church people that you're the church people y got to come up with what is happening here these babyon are coming and saying they are seeing Stu y y got to tell us what is happening then they check in the in the in in the in the scripture and realize that that the prophet Micah have said it in Beth hand but it Trace that promise back to what bam said Malachi is saying the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings healing in his wings so we realize that you know the beautiful thing about this when you think about it you think about it God is identifying himself as the son the natural son is giving for healing praise the Lord what you think people go to uh they go to Florida to go in Beach T what they going to do there when you when you when when you when you when you don't have a a lot of SunRay hitting you you lose V and day so God put healing in the sun even the natural son why because he himself is the son of righteousness and when he rises I'm feeling so excited right now amen I don't care for what you think about it but I'm feeling so excited why the reason why I'm feeling so excited is because this is becoming more real to me it's becoming more real than I ever saw it praise the Lord the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings now so this is this is our our series we've been we've been we've been talking about since the beginning of the word we went through first John sorry we went through first John and uh uh second John it gave us the opportunity to write uh the the I mean to to go through the three books uh that John wrote beside the Gospel of John and he he wrote that after his experience on the island of pmos Praise the Lord so on the island of pmos there were things that John saw you know he saw the the seven golden candlesticks he saw the Throne of God he saw the Lamb of God the opening of the seals he saw all of those things and then when he came back to the church you know he kept he kept referring to the beginning to the beginning to the beginning so now we on the last one year which is written there in 2 John 1: 6 this is the Commandment that's what he said in 2 John chapter 6 this is the commandment and uh uh don't don't don't go there the uh technicians just just stay where we are let me let me just go there uh just for the quick quick reference I just wanted to uh make a comment here are we together you love the Lord amen he's he's a good god he's a good god he's a faithful God now so John said here in verse 6 he said in uh uh second John you having only one uh uh I'm over in first John brother one got be in second okay verse six and this is love this is love that we walk after his commandment this is his Commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning yes should walk in it so when when I was when I was reading this and studying this I wanted to bring this through the entire book so I was I was I was I was saying okay what did they walk in you know then the thought hit me when I was reading T John walking in healing so that's where I taken the inspiration from walking in healing as it was in the beginning so that is our six our seven uh beginning praise the Lord that which was from the beginning the word of life that was the first one we talk about and that which was from the beginning was the logos God himself praise the Lord so we see when John got a revelation of what was taking place on the island of pmos he took everything back to the beginning because the beginning is the C chapter amen the the the old commandment is the word that's why he said the Commandment the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning the third one I write unto you fathers why because fathers our father is our beginning praise the Lord that's where we all begin from naturally humanly we all have fathers that's our beginning Jesus said when you pray say our father that's your beginning you got to identify yourself with your beginning amen if you know your beginning you will know your end praise the Lord if you have a true revelation of your beginning you don't have to worry about the end are we together and uh uh uh Let There therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning so there again let the word abide in you and uh the devil sin it from the beginning we look at that we went into the the the serpent seed we talk about that old sepin uh that's how John call him if there is an old seent then there is a new one praise the Lord so the new sepin the one that you know now is not the old sepin so uh uh uh the six ones here now I I Bes you we talk about the elected lady from the beginning that was the last one that we spoke on praise the Lord a brother called me from India I think he follow our our service on this series and and uh and and he appreciated we thank the Lord for that and uh this is this is the Commandment which we have heard from the beginning that yes should walk in it so we are talking about walking in health walking in healing as it was in the beginning praise the Lord now so we know that uh th was that was one of the thing that was one of the thing yeah I mean uh uh uh it should it should be easy to to uh to be to understand but uh we would just we just trust the Lord if uh you know because God gave his word by Revelation but just like we said you know Adam came right from the hands of God he was a Son of God Eve came out of Adam she was a daughter of God they came out of God praise the Lord amen now how how how then uh uh did their blood became corrupted praise the Lord so we know that uh the the fall the int the the introduction of sin into the human race was the contamination of the blood if they if both of them came directly from the hand of God they should have pure blood how did their blood go corrupted Genesis chapter 3 hold that mystery now so uh uh uh uh but I said that to say because they came from the hand of God they were children of God they never knew anything that that that was sickness they were walking in perfect health praise the Lord they were walking in perfect health in so much that they never had no fear praise the Lord Adam was not worried about doing anything wrong because all he knew was right praise the Lord amen all he knew was right now we worried about doing wrong than worrying about doing right we worried that fear oh I don't want to do wrong oh I don't want to do I don't want to displease God we worried about it why because we fell from that place Adam never thought about it it was never a question in his mind praise the Lord it was not a question in his mind can you imagine can you imagine what happened that day because Adam was not there when the serpent spoke to Eve but can you imagine for the first time that he saw the animals in the Garden of Eden running out of order can you imagine that there was a windstorm and he never knew about it I never knew that there was going to be a storm today where is it coming from praise the Lord why because a daughter of God has failed sin was already introduced and and and and disorder started coming praise the Lord and you imagine the first time that Adam would would experience fear that he will hide himself from God can you imagine in your mind what that was that he would hide himself to hear the voice of God the Bible says the voice of God was walking in the garden calling Adam Adam where are you and for the first time for the first time Adam will hide himself are we together but before then the walk in health they were in such a healthy State and for many years and for many days never knew anything about headache or back pain or stomach upset praise the Lord that was not a that was not a a concern to him it didn't bother him it didn't trouble him and then suddenly something has happened something has happened for the first time that Adam will see blood for the first time he will see blood and say Eve was what happened what happened what went wrong she will say the sein has begil me the first time that she will experience pain the first time time that Adam will look at his wife and his heart will be broken sin this other sickness has entered in Praise the Lord that will be the first night that Adam will go to bed and he will wake up in the morning and he will start to feel his body praise the Lord he will start to feel his body take take that scene and and and and picture it this way picture it like Samson the first time where Samson was say the Samson the Philistine is on you at the time where Samson was samon when he said the Philistine is on he jump up all the Philistines knew that this man were not sleeping the anointing wakes him up in such a strength but when Sam lost his anointing his hair was cut off and it says Sam the Philistine on you he turned back and he got to put his foot off the bed put his other foot down sit down he knew that it was different he knew knew that it was different and when Adam woke up that morning he knew that it was different he knew like if you know yourself you wake up in the morning and you are not okay you know that it's different it's not right I'm not feeling right you know that praise the Lord in the fing body we can know that how much of a man that was living imperfection of Health the first time he will experience imperfection in his body praise the Lord Adam was up before the sun came up but that night the son was up before Adam praise the Lord he was up before the Sun but that morning when Adam woke up the sun was up in his strength and the Son of God was lying there wondering what has gone wrong what has gone wrong praise the Lord Hallelujah since that day the son of righteousness folded his wings just like the cherubins at the East Side praise the Lord the Earth was enjoying healing honor his wings but now he F his wings because the Son of God a daughter of God has stepped out of the word and they are no longer walking in healing Adam will hear noise on that side the animal are attacking one another before he run there there's another one attacking the one on this side oh my God if I I I can't imagine what is this is this is a day that have never been before and pray soon he will year the King has killed Abel death has enter in When sin conceive it bring forth death sin brings sickness sickness brings death are we together are you seeing the picture just trying to build a picture here for you Hallelujah so uh uh okay I can't I kind of misplaced this but let me let me let me do something here quickly I'll go back to that the son of righteousness there are four benefits of the rising of the of the of the sun four benefit of the rising of the sun let me say it that way amen and the Bible says when the Sun rises you have healing in his wings that's for health and protection Jesus said Jerusalem Jerusalem how I will have H you like a hand takes abroad on a Wings praise the Lord when a hand spread her wings it is for protection she protects her little ones from from from uh uh uh uh The Foxes or from whatever animal she said you got to get me first before you can get these little chicks healing on his wings for health and prot protection to you that fear my name you will go forth that's the promise you will go that's Freedom that's Deliverance that's what come with this promise if you have if you have experienced the rid that comes from the son of righteousness praise the Lord you will be you'll be experiencing and enjoying health and protection amen you will be enjoying a sense of Deliverance and freedom praise the Lord when that sun R shine into your spirit it Shin in your human Spirit it brings delivering free you from the curse you shall go forth when you tell someone go you are free you are delivered are we together I love this one you grow up as a calve in the stall the calve is a little the a baby of of a cow amen a little animal there so you will grow up when I look this up it says safety uh you'll be careful when they righteousness Rises on you it will bring you to safety it will bring you onor a Ministry where you will be careful you will be welled that you can grow up to maturity amen not not not just becoming a church member but becoming a Son of God you know where you are standing with the word of God you will grow up now what why I love this is this the cfum you know the beautiful thing about this is that when you go back to Genesis you go back to Genesis even before Moses even before Moses it was Moses honor Moses where the scripture really put what was a clean animal and what was an unclean animal is that right but you realize that even before that time in in uh in uh in uh in the ACT God told Noah that he should take the clean animals seventh their unclean animals must come into the arc two by two it was not every animal that came in PS God was preserving the clean animals and let me tell you another thing again go back and and and and look at over there in exodor or num levitic Leviticus most especially when you talk about the clean animals the clean animals are identified by what chewing their cup chewing their cut the clean animal is identified by that praise the Lord and it and it's applied to us spiritually amen it's a it's a sense of sanctification if you can chew on the word amen a clean animal is identified by that because they chew on their car they they eat and they keep it there go go and look at Leviticus all the animals that are set aside to be clean animals most of them have their attributes they can chew on their cut and God designed that way because we are sheep of his pastures that's what the psalm said this morning amen the psalm brother brother Ben read that's what it it said we are sheep of his pasture and one good nature of sheep is that they chew on their cup they keep it there you know the Bible don't become Dusty they take the word they don't only rely on my pastor say no they take the word and they go back and study the word they they go back and chew that word again and bring it up and chew it again let me look at it again let me look at it again why because in that is safety when you do that there is safety in that amen when you do that you will be fair well amen bring it up chew it again put it back bring it up you will be farewell and then you will grow to maturity so Under This Promise of the son of righteousness Rising I'm just feeling so excited this morning amen it it is it is a light when you see a promise for your day is light the Bible says those that walk in darkness great light has shine on them and that light was was a spiritual light I spoke on this before but never not not like this way not like this way and the fourth one there is that they will tread down on the wicked overcoming power when the son of righteousness Rises when the raid of the sun has shined upon you it will Quicken your mortal body it will give you overcoming power you will overcome yourself you will overcome sin you will overcome the devil it will give you overcoming power right there in Malachi 4 rise up with healing in his wing they will go forth they will grow up as a c in the star they will tread down the wicked that's the four blessings there in Malachi 4 let's take this now over in uh uh Isaiah 53 the Jews called Isaiah 53 the holiest of holy and and I I I say I say the Jews in a sense to say scall let me say scallet because the Jews really they do not try to conform themselves to Isaiah 53 because there is no way they can believe it and don't believe in Jesus when they read Isaiah 53 they try to put it in the future they know that it was speaking about their Messiah are we together amen so in Isaiah 53 when you look at verse 5 but he was wounded for our transgression now you will see in verse five here just like we saw in Malachi there is four things also that is providing the number four is what Deliverance okay so he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised to take care of iniquity he was chesting to take care of peace and the stri on his back was to take care of healing are we together amen but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the Chas of our peace was upon him and with his stries we are healed now so this promise you will realize that many times is is is qued just for physical healing but inia is more than physical healing amen inia is the atonement that tie us to Divine Healing the healing of our soul and our body and our mind like we talk about the peace that passes all understanding the Bible said he was chastised so we can have peace even though our all they suffer but in our soul there's peace of mind we are settled down and know that God is in control what what what you think make those Hebrew boys to say is that uh uh even if our God don't deliver us we will not bow down what make them what brought them to that place so this this is not just only it's not just only for physical healing because no matter how many times you get healed in this body you will still get sick praise the Lord you will still get sick because the body is a filling body the body is not redeemed it's a body of corruption praise the Lord so you cannot limit This Promise only for your physical healing no it's more than your physical healing are we together it's more than your physical healing let's read this together testimony and inside life sorry when you read the Bible what makes you all carry on So when you say he was wounded for our transgression with his tribes you are healed when he said whatsoever thing you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it well what what should what should start rejoicing oh we should start rejoicing sorry I hope you're reading better than I'm doing amen whatsoever thing you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and and you shall have it well we should start rejoicing now brother Bram is saying saying that uh uh I mean just from his promises amen just from his promises as as as as as children of God when the when the raid of the Sun comes it Quicken us it makes us to Rejoice at his promises we should start rejoicing why you say well that's just a word just words but brother before the word could be written in the Bible that's better before the word could be written in the Bible there had to be a deposit made a Calvary up there to take care of everything that he said yes sir and each one of us has an account there and can draw off of it tonight just anything think you have need of and he's standing there with a pen in his hands at the right hand of the father ready to write out your forgiveness ready to write out your healing and anything that you have need of Praise the Lord can we say Amen to the word amen amen I want it to be our blessing let's take it yes he's ready to write it tonight of this morning is that right your deposit was made at Calvary anything that you have need of he's there to make it right before God oh no wonder we are happy people are you happy amen praise the Lord are you happy amen uh darl was it tell your face how do you tell your face that you are happy you smile praise the Lord oh no wonder we are happy people no wonder we can rejoice in the god of our salvation for he is marvelous and one wonderful praise the Lord why because we have these blessed promises are we together it's it's a full package a full package package of Deliverance wounded for your transgression whatever wrong you will do has already been paid praise the Lord he was bruised for your iniquity amen transgression is breaking the Lord iniquity you know what is right and you stay doing it and he was bruised for that he was Chas him for your peace and the strap on his back praise the Lord amen according to the Jewish Lord when a man is weeped on his back the Jews instructed those Roman to give him 39 strap on his back are we together amen so it's it's a full package whatsoever you need God got it amen so let's let's take few few promises here God told the children of Israel he says to them he says and said if thou will diligently y to my voice to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that wishes right in his sight and will give their ear to his commandment what I want you to see here now where your healing is attached to to walk in health is now vent amen is now your diet the diet is right here give ears to his commandment Ying to the voice of the Lord amen I'm giving you your prescription this morning Y into the voice of the Lord thy God do that which is right in his sight give ears to his commandment keep his statures I will put none of these diseases upon you that's your prescription why because because walking in health is attached to obedience in the word because we have to realize that when Adam fell from the word that was where he fell into sickness are we together amen and then and just like I said we are living in a time where H H H Medical Science has improved and we are also living in a Time where there are lot of illness diseases never in a time where an age has suffered from depression anxieties amen people are just sided in their mind all of those things are demon powers corrupting the spirit of man when you have when you have everything to live for the devil tell you you don't have nothing to lay for take your life are we together David pick up the SE over in Psalm bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits we just went through the benefit that comes with the healing in his wings Health protection praise the Lord the same way you work for your company and you want benefit you serve the Lord the Lord have a full package benefit in serving the lord that's why brother bandam says don't don't leave your post of Duty you have a post of Duty in the house of God can't serve God part time a person that is part-time in a job do not get the full benefit you want have coverage go full time amen you want have coverage on the Lord go full time forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases brother bam says you have to realize it's an all it's an all a cover everything it cover everything are we together praise the Lord let's look at another one here David said this in the psalm why are thou cast down oh my soul and why are thou disired within me hope in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my continence praise the Lord amen the health of my countenance the Lord is my [Laughter] makeup he keeps me smiling he keeps me laughing he keeps me happy he's the health of my countenance you're serving God and you're walking with your head hanging down praise the Lord where is your God like brother Bram says he says the birds the birds didn't

happy they wake up in the morning they have a Heavenly Father he's the health of our continence as a Son of God as a daughter of God you must be able to express it the Lord is good to me praise the lord we think that the way to be able to get is to make ourself look like we are so desperately in need if we don't have it now we will die and amen Solomon said this sorry Solomon said this my son attend to my words take it like a father Our Father speaking to us hear my word hear my word take my word incline their ears unto my sin pay pay attentiveness to that stay voice take his word pay attention when you reading a promise pay attention to it amen don't just read over and say hallelujah amen I believe it God said it I believe it pay attention to it let them not depart from their eyes keep them in the midst of that heart meditate upon it do just like the Sheep bring it up again bring it up again memorize it paraphrase it say it to yourself he forgiveth me of all my iniquity he Health me of all my diseases thank you Jesus say it to yourself amen for they are life unto those that find them if you look for it in the word if you look for the promises and they are Health to all their flesh keep the heart with all diligence for out of fa are the issues of Life are we together we're trying to find a place to close here now and then uh taking a few uh quotes here on son of righteousness when the son of righteousness from the message faith rise with healing in his wings pay attention now pay attention I want to see if you grab this pay attention to to that when the son

like his for we shall see him as he is No more healing service then No more healing service then praise the Lord amen does that means that we cannot have a healing service in church no we can have it

relationships amen amen amen we cannot be talking about a God that can heal he's a miracle working God and then we dealing with things in our home and in our relationship we can't even sit down and let the word of God brings our comfort we are living with a son of righteousness we shall abide under the shadow of his wings through Seas ages he t find this promise to Eternity sit down sit down by the evergreen tree where the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the Nations when does that happen the Millennium so you see this promise of Mal of of Malachi 4 goes all the way and what I want you to realize let me not go ahead of myself it goes all the way I almost jump the gun praise the Lord when I get excited that's what happened now look at this uh uh what is the attraction on the mountain no praise the Lord you love the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of praise praise the l i I don't know why you saw but I think some something happen you cut me I would just leave it I won't com in I won't comment I would just leave it praise the Lord amen my mind was going somewhere I would just leave it now look at this look at this brother I'm talking what is the attraction on the mountain look at this this is very important Church praise the Lord you know why I love to do this because it's my responsibility to put you in the promise a church must never be built around a preacher amen why because I could drop dead right after the service but The Church Must continue if the people are not standing on the word when a man dies the church dies right praise the Lord and I will tell you with h our our our little time year we we as an assembly have seen healing to this church yes sir I'm coming to that praise the lord we have seen healing to this little assembly praise the Lord I know I mean some some are strangers but that's okay strangers are you know God make a promise for strangers also he told us not to you know not to uh cast our strangers so if a person want to be stranger to the church that's fine we carry you along but you know that strangers are not entitled to the four inheritance praise the Lord yeah so watch this now watch this 30 this together brother I'm talking about what is the attraction on the mountain he's talking about the position of his ministry at that time amen but unto you he's taking this promise unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing campaigns what what was he doing he was identifying the birth of healing campaign that have brought us to this place of all all the prophets that are in the land they all call themselves prophets Prophet Prophet J Prophet J Prophet J somebody here they are hungry and some the Lord told me somebody all of this I mean all everything that the world have seen today it came from it was birth somewhere praise the lord it's just like when the Jews were returning back to their Homeland and they saw airplanes flying back those Jews back to their Homeland their mind went back to the prophecies that they will be brought back on the wings of an eagle now a prophet here now is is identifying something healing campaigns the Bible say healing on his wings and and and and and a Wings is used to fly so brother Bram is is is taking our mind to say realize Church how these healing campaigns have gone over the word it has spark over robber AA Allen Tomy hbor all of these men great men that that preach Divine Healing that's right it brought FF bosor from out of retirement e Bosell has preached he has already retired when he saw the ministr of the son of man he said this is what I've been waiting for he came out of retirement to be a manager to brother Brandon the Lord that's why history is important go back and read church history I was thinking about doing doing something I'm I'm still working on it there are many of these Church churches Baptist Methodist Presbyterian some of the people that are in it they don't even know who is the founder they don't even know how those moves started you are in something you don't even know you don't even know the history of it how can you sustain it healing campaigns healing in his wings praise the Lord go back and read history they will tell you he's the father Tommy hband came and says brother BR you think I can do this he said Tommy God the promise the promise is place the people in the word tell me as says I I I I can never do this brother I can I cannot descend people he says the gift is not for you but put the people in the word if you can if you can bring the promise before the people that God has purchased your healing if you can make it real to them they will step in their healing and you can do it you can do the same yes sir don't bring brother from his grave take the word the word has been given to you make the word real put the person name there you try to impersonate the son of man Ministry you'll be blasphemy you go to hell for it CU you will never repeat that it will never be repeated all of these people that are impersonating someone showed me the C of a Blasphemous photo uh recently I think very when he was here the brother took brother Brandon from there and put a pillow of fire over his head all looking for some kind of for recognition then we say it's the message of the hour when the word is f with realities but I just wanted to catch your mind on this I saw this many years uh son of Rous would ride with healing campaigns healing in his wings now let's let's let's take this now these two messages were preach in the same day so just follow the trench of thought here now to them that fear his name shall the son of RA righteousness rise with healing in his wings let the son of righteousness the word of God let the son of righteousness their Living Word the word that you are believing the word that been preached to you don't look to history The Living Word is here the word is real let the son of righteousness the word of God rise in the heart of the people and the healing rate of faith in that word kills every disobedient not the sensation you feel it's the virtue that comes from out of the word that's the reason why I say is that we play church until we don't take the word of God serious we don't take it serious we are just happy to just be a church member but this is a Living Word you cannot go under the sun without feeling its effect if you get under the son you will feel its effect how can you sit under the son of righteousness the reveal word of the hour and there is no effect of the word in your life I believe brother Bram I believe pill of fire I believe I believe believe he was sent for sons of God to be manifested sir he was sent for you to get off your but and stand on your feet and be a Son of God face your life with this with the word of God let the son of righteousness the word of God rise in the heart of the people praise the Lord amen he was not building a court he was not calling people to himself he was Raising Jesus Higher because the promise said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me let a son of righteousness ride the word of God praise the Lord it rise in the

to the word it will bring healing the word heals the word delivers the word can give you overcoming power it's a promise the son of righteousness that have rised with healing in his wings praise the Lord what bless my heart yesterday studying this subject I was just thinking about few things just like I said even for us as a church we have experienced healing in this assembly not talking about I yeah you know we thank God for the the ones that were pray for the ones you know are being healed but a church body a church praise the Lord amen and it it Rejoice our hearts and rejoice our hearts and I sat there yesterday at hell all of these young people the ones we dedicated in this church the ones we baptize year see just like John said Rejoice my heart to see my children walking in truth and many of us we we had our experience and you know we settled down in our area so we kind of for stuck to that and you know and you know and thank God for that as as much as your experience can can edify the body we thank the Lord for that but you see we have a younger generation if if if if if Jesus started if this church don't experience healing from the son of righteousness it is not going to continue praise the Lord for the little ones praise the Lord for the little ones that that are born here that are dedicated year we labor we keep these doors open for them I mean you are at the place of your life and uh you know your achievement your dreams and all of that because that's that's that's what church is you realize if the Lord would give us few years from now praise the Lord you know uh uh s now me daughter raised and the family that comes here with the history of this church I learned her wedding was the first wedding Year and that always blesses me whenever I see she and her husband here because I hold that as a token sometimes you people don't I mean can to tell you everything human mind don't run Church it runs by the spirit of God yes sir and sometimes it's just one thing you just hold up said God I hold this thing as said token we just don't just don't want to come to church there people com and and and you know look for the church that is full that everybody standing outside and people in their car whether they standing outside talking not even listening to just to have a crowd no when the healing rid of the word comes in the heart of the people they will not wait for the doors to be open sir they will come prayed up they will be lining their family up with the word that's what we talking about that's what a church is praise the Lord you see many of the Young The Young Ones you know well they see they see folks coming up for communion they want to take communion they get anxious they want to take communion before you realize they want to be baptized they are just iming to take communion as soon they come they eat the bread drink the wine they already know what it is that's that's not what it's for that's not what for and to the parent that's why when a child comes to me I said go and talk to your parent because it's it's it's your responsibility as a parent to be able to know that your child is ready for that and then when that child comes and that child is baptized by the authority of the word I have in every right every right because that church that child has been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ into the body yes I don't have to ask your permission if I need to correct them on the word I don't need your permission let me tell you now they are a member of this church I have every right on the scripture
