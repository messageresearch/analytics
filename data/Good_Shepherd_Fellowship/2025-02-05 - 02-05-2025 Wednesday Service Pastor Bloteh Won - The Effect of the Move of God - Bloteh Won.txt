it I was so tired from the service on Sunday and uh uh but then we had to just do the best to go out and and be able to support them praise the Lord so tonight I want to speak on on uh a little thought that being on my mind for the while uh that I that I title the effect of the move of God the effect of the move of God praise the Lord just like the Bible says in Genesis chapter one and uh uh the spirit of God mov that was the first time that uh the great intent of God that was the first time Elohim we move out of the space of being the great innal spirit you have to know being the great eternal spirit he fill all time and all space and uh but uh that that that God will will will create a beginning for himself that God that the great internal Spirit the great Elohim will have a beginning for himself which mean he condescended God condemns himself and then he condescended he he had to put all his great internal power in himself to form a body and then drop down out of uh eternity to time praise the Lord and when he dropped down uh then that that great interal spirit that was filling all time y said now he had enough space because he have cond he had condensed himself and then the Bible say he started moving and I mean he was moving all over the place all over the place God was moving amen the Bible says the spirit of God move he moved upon the spirit of God mov upon the face of the water amen the spirit of God moved in that darkness and in that chaos thou was the first move of God praise the Lord because we will learn and and and and realize that brother brandham called every Revival a move of God that's what a Revival is amen a Revival is a move of God so this is the first move of God and when God moved in the beginning uh uh uh uh there was an effect of his move praise the Lord the Bible says and the spirit of God move upon the face of the water and God said let there be light and there was light amen the spirit moved and God spoke behind the spirit and the spirit brought to pass exactly what God Said praise the Lord and we saw that that uh that uh effect of that move of God as you look as you go down and and and and there was light and and God saw that the light was good and and and and the spirit of God uh separated the water from the land what a move what a great move of God praise the Lord amen and and what happened in the first move of God happened in every move of God praise the Lord amen every time God move he brings a message when he move in the first time he said let there be light amen every time God move he bring a message and every time the message go forth it cause a separation just like it was in Eden it separated the water from the land it separated the day from from the night there was a separation and every time uh uh uh uh the spirit of God move it brings out the seeds that was in the Earth let every seed uh uh uh bring forth of its kind are we together praise the Lord like I said we just trying to in introduce this thought and and layer Foundation year so uh I hope I can be able to to help you to fall into the same channel where I am now so we see that in every move of God there is there is an there there is an effect whenever the spirit of God move whenever God move and uh and and and and and and that's the reason why we are here tonight you know I mean it's just now to have another religious SE but is also to be affected by the move of God because we believe there is a move of God in our day amen there is a move of God in our day when God condescended and he moved he never stopped praise the Lord he kept moving you'll never read one place where the Bible says and the spirit of the law stopped the spirit of God moved and it kept moving and is moving today praise the Lord it keep moving and is moving today now because tonight is a Wednesday night and we not like want to keep you a whole lot we will just will just hold one familiar code that we all uh uh uh very acquainted with we will that's what we will deal with tonight and then uh on Sunday we'll be able to go into more details of what we what we want to share with you that is the the Ephesian Church age I read this before and I believe you have heard it before I believe you have read it before but we want to just look at that together praise the Lord amen now this particular thought has been has been on my mind uh uh for for some time now I've been kind of for looking at it amen I've been kind of for looking at it and and really wanted to to to speak on it and uh and bring it to you in in a way that uh uh we'll be able to appreciate praise the Lord now so uh uh uh brother brandom said here have you ever studied the history of Revival amen so Revival has a history and just like I said uh uh Earth this this space was experiencing its first Revival praise the Lord amen it was experiencing its first Revival and that Revival was the move of God are we together so if we are going to look at the history of Revival and the the the the the Revival that we going to look at is every time that God move in history that's what we going to look at so uh tonight we going back right from the first move of God which is there in Genesis chapter one and we want to look at the positive effect and also the negative effect because there is a negative effect and if we are in a move of God that we that that we call the message of the hour which is uh uh according to scripture is uh uh the message to the seven Church ages and uh the the one that was moving in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick is it's still moving today is is uh there that's the message that we are honored that's what has affected our life that's what we are here fellowshipping around tonight amen so he said if you if you ever studied the history of Revival now a Revival signify a move of God in power amen a move of God in power now you you just think about it now there was no there was no other h h h creature there there was no human there it was not a crowd it was not a a Convention of 10 million people no this was almighty God himself amen amen with with nobody and nothing yet he move praise the Lord hallelujah and you don't need this this uh h a few group of people to experience the move of God you can have the move of God in your home praise the Lord amen God do not need a poopit he don't need a a musical team to move there were no musician there but yet God was having a Revival yes praise the Lord if God is determined to bring his word to pass there is nothing that is going to stop it God was determined to manifest his attributes he was determined to bring out his attribute he had this great plan in his mind and he was determined to manifest it so brother B let us know now Revival signified a move of God in power and he's trying to help us to see that every time God moves Satan is there to move also are we together praise the Lord amen so we will see we we will pretty we will pretty much see that it would take Genesis chapter one Genesis chapter 2 and in Genesis chapter 3 that's when we will will now start to see Lucifer moving praise the Lord that's now we we start to see thou old serpent moving praise the Lord because you have to realize that his move is always an impersonation of God's move that's right amen praise the Lord hallelujah he always have to watch to see how the spirit of God is moving for him to impersonated and move are we together amen so Satan is there to move also he says it never fail praise the Lord it never fail H if it happened in the first Revival is going to happen in this revival and I say it is happening in this revival praise the Lord he's cting the message amen he has entered our message homes he's behind our message poits in the church hbook brother bam say he have invaded the pit using businessmen that's what he said he said businessman has invaded the pit when Jesus said my house is the House of Prayer they have turned it to uh uh uh the Chambers of Commerce are we together he said it has never failed now he's going to give us some things to watch out and that's what that's what I want to labor on a little bit tonight uh uh and then Sunday we will we will go a little bit further giving us an example here he says in the days of the Welsh Revival and most people don't know this the reason why most people don't know it is because many times when when there is a move of God when when there is uh uh when the blessings of God come down in a service we we only see the people that shout and praise the Lord the people that lift their hands up the people that walk Worship in the spirit that's what we see but we also don't see what the devil does because you cannot you cannot eliminate that even on the day of Pentecost because it never fails every time God move the devil also move he said most people don't know this they're insane as Solem fill up quickly amen and there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from God and we seeing the same thing taking place now praise the Lord amen and that's what that's what I want to Dell on a little bit tonight as we talk about the move of God because look at that move that that was the move of God in creation that was the move of God in creation almighty God speaking his word into existence bringing a universe into existence creating the Heaven and the Earth what what a Revival I believe that because brother B says the first thing that God there was angels and the angels might have worshiped God for who know how long and now when God condescended and started creating I believe they all pull back and watch and says whoa this logos this being that we have been worshiping seeing the see the expression that is coming out of him the thing that he's speaking is coming to manifestation what is this being praise the Lord and the Bible says and in the sixth day the same God I said let there be light he says let us make man in our image I believe all the Angels pull back to watch what is this if this great God this one that we have been worshiping and uh and and and uh H H uh proclaiming ho it and War it and and and and and and wonderful if he can bring out a son and and and we see his words separating the water from the land and and and we see trees sprinking out of the earth now he's saying he's going to create a man in His image and in his likeness what is this I believe they all stood if they have hands to fold they fold their hands and they were watching what is this creature praise the Lord amen but you see when God made man he made man a spirit man praise the Lord he made man a spirit because he was making Man In His Image and in his likeness man was there but he was not there praise the Lord amen that is the mystery of our existence that's the reason why h h h ELO who says to to job where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy because they were there but they were not there praise the Lord everything that God made came into a physical manifestation everything came into a visual manifestation but when he he made man he was a spirit praise the Lord and I think that thing got to the devil so it got to the devil so much he said the first thing he said he's going to make somebody in His image and in his likeness and now we can see him praise the lord we can't we can't see him man is there he's made he the Bible said he made man male and female created he them they were there but they were not there you see that is the thing that is so powerful about your spirit praise the Lord amen that is the thing that is so powerful about your spirit man it long existed before this body praise the Lord how long the man stayed in that state I don't know but what I know was God created man in His image and in his likeness and the devil could not figure it out everything that God when God said let there be light there was light the light was visible when he created the flowers of the earth they were visible praise the Lord oh my this is beautiful when he created the trees they were visible but when he created man man was not visible but man was there praise the Lord I believe that is some of the things that make the angels to know that now they are subject to this other creature because he's there but he's not there the same way you can be here and not here praise the Lord the same way your body can be here but you are not here man was there but he was not there praise the Lord it took a while God ignoring all of this Plan of Redemption all that he had in his mind and he knew that he was doing this thing because uh he has already created an an adversary called the devil he was Lucifer he knew that so you see God God kept his timing to himself amen the devil don't know God's timing concerning your life he don't know nothing about it God keep that to himself it was to God himself he knew when he wanted to put that man in flesh after the devil has wondered he has wondered he has wondered what is this man how do he looks like how do he looks like praise the Lord he wonder and wonder trying to figure this man that is in God's image you mean there is somebody that is going to be more closer to God than me he's trying to figure it out and he couldn't praise the Lord when he was not expecting then God the brother Bram said he make men of the Dust of the Earth Genesis 2:7 he formed the dust of the earth I believe that the devil was just watching and he saw this creature forming from the D dust of the Earth with legs and hands and standing there and the spirit of God move praise the Lord God move again and he breathed into that man and the Man became a living soul but say his toes were stuck in the earth like a root he had to kick his foot off the Earth praise the Lord amen are we together the spirit of God moved and God breath into man and Man became a living Soul before the devil will realize man is already on the Earth praise the Lord you see that's the reason why he did not hide the day you will be saved the devil never had it because if he had it he would have done everything for you to die before the day you got saved before he realized a Son of God was on the earth a Son of God was moving around amen and he was not even learning immediately he had Dominion he had power to speak big things into existence it took the Devil by surprise you mean are been here all this time praise the Lord that's the effect of the move of God if the first move of God produce son and daughter of God this move of God will produce Sons and Daughters of God no matter what they say amen hallelujah and took the Devil by surprise before he realized there was a man on the earth he said but I thought he said male and female because every other creature he brought them male and female I remember he said male and female but it's only one when is the female coming praise the Lord hallelujah before he will realize one day a take Darkness just came on the earth take Darkness God created so much darkness that the Devil Couldn't look through to see so much Darkness oh I'm feeling so good tonight praise the Lord hallelujah so much darkness that the devil would not even be able to spar what was going on before he will realize there is a woman on the earth oh my God oh my God that's what he said male and female man I wonder how he made him man because that woman she was carrying The Mystery of the Redemption in her God had to take take her behind the curtains amen you know like those days of developing fames they go into the dark room they take the negative into the dark room to be able to develop it and that's what almighty God was doing he took Eve into the dark room praise the Lord Hallelujah because in that weak of vessel he's going to put the mystery of redemption he's going to give her three sacri that he never gave to the man are we together you love the Lord tonight that was the first move of God the effect of the move of God praise the Lord you see when when when God move when the Bible says the spirit of God move he brought forth his attributes he brought forth a Son of God he brought forth a daughter of God they were so affected by the move of God that they were under the spirit of God and that's what this message should do to us amen if we are really affected praise the Lord but remember now B Bram said as we just read here remember he said most people don't know this praise the Lord and I believe even even uh HH Adam never knew it he was in this move of God I mean the Revival was going every day Adam had to do something I mean uh he felt so good when God comes down in the evening oh man he would give a report father I did this and I did that I mean he would name he named all the animals and just exactly the way that God Amen praise the Lord let a scor Come From Here let a scor come little fish I give you back your life I mean that's that's what Adam was doing in edting that was that was the effect of a move of God hallelujah and he thought it would be like that all the time and you see that's what happened when people experience Revival when they experience Revival Even in our own personal life God will give you a little measure maybe he's blessing your prayer life or he's blessing your your your understanding of the word he begins to pull the curtain and you beginning to get inside of the word you know sometimes those blessing just make us to feel so good amen and we want it like that every day we just want it to be like that praise the Lord amen Adam thought it was going to be like that he never believed that oh my what a time when when when when the Lord comes down in the evening I mean the the the worship the the fellowship just to see that God was well placed such such a ctif passion you know that thing of coming to service and Feeling So Satisfied you feel like he spoke to me I enjoy the word of God I enjoy the presence of God he never knew that it would not last long praise the Lord amen hallelujah that's what I will tell you tonight whever you are enjoying of the spirit of God you better enjoy it because it will not last long there is a devil that is fighting against it if you are enjoying the presence of God you better enjoy it amen you better enjoy it Hallelujah he didn't know that it would not last long Genesis 3 praise Lord Genesis 3 a year sin is introduced something has happened something has happened something has come into the camp praise the Lord For the First Time Adam and his wife they will come to this Consciousness that something has happened glory be to God you know what has happened the enemy just like brother brandom says here I'll read that again most people don't know this the insane Asom fil earthquake and there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from God and that very same thing happened in the first Revival praise the Lord now you have to realize that the devil affected their reasoning it's a sense of the spirit amen you see because he knows that the first form that God created in was a spirit being so so if he can affect their Spirit he can get their body under control praise the Lord so he affected their reasoning the God say so that's why he started with Eve affected her reasoning and she gives into the devil lying and we know sin has entered so you see what happened here just like brother said a a spirit of insanity was now injected into the hemorage which is doubt amen which is unbelief are we together but think about it what the Bible says the Bible says when when uh when King was born she says I have received a man from the Lord Brother Braham says in in uh in uh uh uh the church age book he said she he says that if actually believe that he was a man from the Lord praise the lord it's truth that God is the one that give life but she never realized that something has affected her praise the Lord that she's giving birth to a seed of The Serpent and yet she called it is from the Lord do you see that Insanity where people can be doing things contrary to the word and they say God told me and they can actually believe that it is God praise the Lord until King will kill Abel Eve would never believe that this was not a man from the Lord until King will kill his own brother right in the field before she will come to the realization oh my God but she believe it she believe it why God came down and and and and wrapped them in sheep's skin and and you know and and and try to reconcile them and bring them back and and and so she took that mercy of God she took that grace of God and did not realize that the devil has injected a wrong seed in her praise the Lord she said I have received a man from the Lord she believe it she believed that thou was a man of God are we together but see the effect of the Revival they have just had the Glorious time of the Revival they had a time where God was coming down every meeting God came down every service God came down now the church is going through a tough time they have to sing they have to pray and sometime the service is dry I mean they are not having the kind of a Revival they used to have are we together see what will happen King Andel is born and they are sharing with them I mean I mean yeah at the beginning of the message at at the beginning of this revival oh my God you see that Hill down there it used to be down there I I I sent it down there really Daddy really and they giving them all of this story about the Revival just like we hear everything on tape we were now there praise the Lord hallelujah and and and he giv them everything everything that was happening oh my God you know uh H H uh I don't know I mean this this animal just came before me I man I I what a glorious time it was I mean something just got a hold of me and I said you are a lion can you believe that evening God came down and he he said that's exactly the name oh my God is giving them the Revival the report of the Revival when the Revival was in his fire just like men will come and preach and and when he talk about you know brother Brandon you know and what happened in the meeting and says my mother was in the meeting or my father was in the meeting I mean you hold to that so close because you know that this is an eyewitness Adam was an eyewitness but king and a they were now eye witnesses before they came something has happened to the Revival something has happened to the move of God and I will tell you Church before we came before we came you and myself something has happened to the Revival praise the Lord something has happened to this move of God is different than when the prophet of God was on the earth praise the Lord amen but God is still moving Hallelujah God is still moving that did not stop God from moving God was still moving how did we know that God was moving because if it got a revelation if got got a revelation of what took place when he was not there he got a revelation when he was not born what took place in Genesis chapter 3 he was able to that that was the move of God you see the move of God H Adam experienced it in a different way Abel experienced it in a different way Abel experienced it on the Revelation are we together praise the Lord oh my but this is where I want to get to before we close as as a as H King Andia was listening to to the message that was preached and they were telling them about God came down and what happened you know uh and and how wonderful it was and and how beautiful it was I mean there there was there was a there was a desire there was just Crave in the heart of Abel he was just craving oh God oh God I want to experience that amen and I'm I just don't want to rely on my parents experience I want to experience it for myself and God gave him an experience God struck him with a revelation and the Revelation became his Revival praise the Lord a creat a desire in him to go and worship a creat a desire in him to bring an excellent sacrifice praise the Lord hallelujah that's the effect of the Revival the Revival will will affect you and it will create in you a desire for true worship you will not just be satisfied with church worship you will one true worship and they that worship the father will worship Him in spirit and in truth hallelujah king was there he was enjoying his Birthright he heard Eve saying over and over when you were born I said I've received a man from the Lord all of that was just making his shoulder big he fell like a man from the Lord praise the Lord he felt like being a man from the Lord he could do anything he was not giving heed to the word that was being preached he had no desire to experience God he was just going on the Praises praise the Lord but remember now brother bandam told us that honor every Revival when God move Satan also move and when the devil move what he does is that he bring a spirit of insanity he affect the people to challenge the authority of the word can you see how bored King was so much that when God came down to talk to him he said am I My Brother's Keeper praise the Lord he was in the Revival he was on his effect of the Revival the Revival affected him in a different way than it affected Abel Abel was affected by a revelation to bring worship and sacrifice to God King was affected in the wrong way he was challenging the word of God am I my brother keeper speaking right back to God God said if you can go back and do what your brother God is making every provision is not in him to repent it's not in him to submit himself to the word oh he can cut the courts he can talk about when when uh when the mountains were made when the Lions were named when all the animals was named that Spirit of arrogance praise the Lord are you seeing the same thing in your Revival the spirit of arrogance a spirit that can't submit to the word we call everything God God spoke to me God told me and we're not able to bring what God Said back to the word let me tell you I've dwelt in this place for the while and started think is the very same thing that is happening in our Revival we have a bunch of insane people people have been affected by this revival it never gave them birth they are not born again the Revival did not change their life the Revival only make them arrogant it put a religious spirit on them and they are just Arrogant with no birth no Revelation a true revelation of God will submit to the word of God not how you explain it is how you live it the effect of the Revival praise the Lord I don't know how this revival is affecting you it's not enough to say I'm in the message I'm born in the message all of those things they have there I mean it's good to to edify yourself are we together how is the Revival affecting us this is the move of God and when God moved in the beginning it brought a creation a new creation the move of God will bring a new creation in our lives see all of these things that are taking place and yet we say we are in the in the message we are in the Revival there is no other Revival than the seven T of Revival and man with unconverted Spirits what did the Bible says God came down and spoke to a King he refused he challenge the the the spirit of God and what happened the Bible says God put a mark on him he was going away from the Revival as a vabor he will be a man that will roam around and tell people I'm in the message oh I know I know that preacher I know Eddie bisco I know H he can call all the big preachers name he will just be moving around but he can never come to rest he can never come to rest it's a spirit of insanity it goes with every Revival remember now brother Brandon told us you can never come into the presence of God and ever go back to same they either change your life for the better or you go back to worse that's a typical example right there in eding it Chang Abel for the better because he got a revelation a affected King in a way that he could kill his own brother with no remars you know this is that what Jesus said Jesus said they will even kill you and say God told them to do it that's why he told his disciple because those Pharisees were they were also in a Revival we get we'll get to that we'll bring it down we bring it down we just dealing with Eden that was the first Revival Noah had a Revival 120 years preaching the message standing as a preacher of righteousness at the end of his Revival he was lying drunk he was lying naked drunk I say to you tonight before we pray and go home let us now play with this message of the hour this thing we call the message of the hour let us not play with it your life is on the line the life of your children is on the line let's not just make a religion out of it I know hundreds of men many men and they can never they can never they can never see that they they have they have a spirit of insanity why because it's a religious spirit it justify everything by the word they can be stealing they were justifi by the word lying they were justifi by the word it's a religious spirit when you come into the presence of God it touches you you tremble and you think oh yeah oh yeah was it I really feel it it must not stop there let it create a birth let it bring forth a birth you know the thing that is that is more powerful about this it trap your life with what you have known and what you have heard your life is trapped you cannot walk out of this think that you will live a normal life in the world you cannot walk out of this when I when King walk away from the presence of God his life was not normal you can never walk away from this and think you will live a normal life your life is trapped am I scaring you I don't mean to be a boogman I mean to tell you the truth I'm here to tell you the truth because all of these things are happening and people are wondering oh what's happening to the message what's happening to the message go back the prophet told you studied the history of Revival that's why he said go back and study the history of Revival when God move Satan move also praise the lord it's 9:05 I won keep you and long because I have more to say the Lord bless you by your heads tonight musicians you can come let's just take our hearts to the Lord let's just take our hearts to the

know we can we can blast out you know women wearing trouser we can blast out all of this but the move of God is to affect our life is to affect your life brother is to affect your life sister but brandom says in every age God gave the people a chance at the word that's their Revival this is our time this is our time we must not allow this time to pass Us by people press into the kingdom be Earnest with God say Lord help me change me let this revival change me because I will never be the same let it make me a better husband to my wife a better wife to my husband a better parent to my
