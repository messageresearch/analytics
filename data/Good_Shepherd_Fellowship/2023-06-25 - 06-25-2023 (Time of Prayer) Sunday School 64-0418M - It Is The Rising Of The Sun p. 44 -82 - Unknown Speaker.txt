foreign [Music] [Music] to the other and to support this great fun or drive for the doctors and medical science to work upon uh something to retire to help the tuberculosis they are still what we call an Easter seal when we send message one to another but when we receive the message that seal is broken because the seal is what got a message bound on the inside and now the true Easter seal on this Sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed before that time we didn't know the world [Music] um drooped in darkness groped around man's suspicion theories was among man's heart tradition made up man worshiped Idols to worshiped the sun they worshiped all kinds of gods and all kinds of people that made claims they all went into the grave and they stayed in the grave but the real seal had been broken and one who once lived as we live died as we will die was risen from the dead what a morning never one like it in all the history of the world the secret was made known that he was both resurrection and alive and he said when he come forth on that morning because I live you live also Not only was he the beneficiary of the Resurrection but all those see that was resting in God's Great promise was a benefactor of that Resurrection to life because he said because I live ye shall live also that was the breaking of the seal because he was brought up so will everyone that in Christ be brought up with him at this glorious Sunrise God had proven or Vindicated his word all the dreams and doubts that have moved in people's minds was taken away because here was he who once lived eat drink and fellowship with mankind that said I have power to lay my life down I have power to raise it up again and now not only had he made the statement but he proved it to be the truth oh glorious thing that is I'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was because he raised from the dead we also have already raised from there while we were in him notice now as the Gloom covered the earth and the seeds could not live without the Su in derived and Gloom had covered the Earth and now the s-o-n was risen and all Gloom was vanished by this light as it spread across of the Nations to the people that he is not here but he has risen what a what a statement he had proved his word he had proved it be to be true or he had now conquered death Hell In The Grave the Trinity of the devil this hell and the grave or Satan is the author of death he is the possessor of hell and also the Great and that was the trinity of Satan being caused by one thing that was death death you go with the grave and being a sinner you go to hell all the very one thing the Trinity of Satan which was death that and help man in captivity all these years but now the true Trinity of God being one manifested in Christ who was life and it broke the seals they conquered the enemy and Rose up the one true and living God I am he that was good and I'm Alive forevermore has a Jesus death and Hell God in one made man and dwelt Among Us and conquered every enemy I had to approved that the Trinity of Satan was conquered and at the Trinity of God was made known because only God Alone had power to bring life back again was that Emmanuel God had been manifested in the flesh no wonder he could claim their Matthew the 27th chapter all powers Inhibitors is given into my hands uh send you to be my witnesses to all the world he had conquered both death hell and the grave not only did he do that and come out Triumph with all the power and heavens and earth all that was the father all that was the Holy Ghost and all that there ever was was in him all powers in heaven and in Earth is given unto me everything else is powerless he had conquered it now and not only that he sent word to his disciples just believing feared up for I am he that was dead that is alive again forevermore I have the keys to death and Hell I've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every for our state predestinated seed of God shall come to lie for that life spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the cross that God are danger to do raised from the dead oh what a wonderful thing that is I am alive or quickened the word means the word Quicken the Greek word means that's something that's made alive after death like the the seed that goes into the Earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rock every bit of a seat and every bit of the life that was in the seat has to come forth again he was quickened not only that I will stand the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave I will send it upon you to Quicken you that where I am there ye will be also in Luke 24 chapter 49 verse he said behold I send the promise of the father upon you but Terry are waiting in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from Ohio show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits become to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seeds that God seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in The Book of Life and here they are on the earth without a hope he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessings with every predestinated seed now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth also germatized no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the son shines upon notice now he come to share it with us no wonder the gospel is good news the very word gospel means the good news the good news why if a man died or sake that's good news if Christ was born that's the news but never do never was our news like this news that he who made the promise has confirmed the promise that he's Alive forevermore have the keys of both death and Hell anytime all the Gloom are shut away there is no more dream to be seen for the Sun but up from the grave no uh he will come or he may come he had already come the gospel good news notice the very message of the Gospel itself is to prove to the people that he has risen go tell my disciples that I have risen from the dead and I'll meet with them to confirm this to them Club how is this last days there shall be light to get across the Earth how proved about his Bible you tell them that I am not dead and I'm not a tradition but I am a living Christ I'll meet them take this message to my disciples that I'm risen from the dead the gospel good news you say is that right Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we as beneficiers are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of despite the life he never was alive live like it he was the son of God and he died and that's shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on Easter morning then we as his servant are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is a lady and how can we do it by word only for it is written the gospel King not my word only but through the power in the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive now if there is another gospel that Paul spoke to one of the groups I am so surprised that you turned to another gospel which there is no other for a make-believe gospel to a denominational fiction turning from that good news and because I live you live also and I live in you and the works that I do John 14 12 the words that I do will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come right again there will be a resurrection in the evening it shall be like at the evening time now the very essence of the message that was said that he is risen from the dead we as beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that He Is Alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it for some traditional manner we only reflect exactly what we're applying to I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to Christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one and the only one that has life son has I and if the life of a man is dead be projected in you you will live the same life he lives if the blood of a man was a certain type you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of a one man into another he'd absolutely be that type of blood and of your spirit that's in you is Recon dead and you are anointed with the life that was in Christ is upon you Romans 8 11 says if the spirit that laid Christ from the dead dwells in you it'll also Quicken your mortal body that same life then pain powers then save beneficiaries that he had your own Earth from God he redeemed you a seed that was forgot my God whose names was put on the last book of life before the foundation of the world and that gospel why are the Resurrection the confirmation of the word how did we know he was a Christ because he proves what he talks about it God I know that message of the hour God proves what he promised that he talks about that is the identification we are beneficiaries with him in the he proves what he's talked about what he promised to do in Christ he proved on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of Moses he proved him what he promised in the days of Enoch he proved it in all the days of their Apostles he proved it now in this day he proves what he said that Lord they are a part of that that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to God again oh what a message my Easter morning not only erased race but his beneficiar's raised with him they were in Christ that is crucial and he met his resurrection we are his beneficiaries Quicken after being dead in darkness the darkened world of unbelief or churches and denominations and so forth have drawn us out and there's something in his calling oh we won't God we're hundred and thirsty for God We join the Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian just want more still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet and all others tell me why we was groping in darkness the great Resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of God like he was the manifestation of the promised word of God I will not be this soul in hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption manifested in every word of God that was promised to him he proved it when he raised on the Eastern Marine [Music] darkness and wandering around a patient wash feet on this day or if they should keep a certain day or do a certain set of rules all of those things passed away well that was a glorious resurrection that the fire ever a man-made thing that man had ever done ever man-made reason I had never been to that time a man that could lay his life down and pick it up again he defied that scientific proof they had by raising again they say that Jesus Christ isn't this thing yes you did have forever that his power isn't the same that gospel is when the Bible says it's the same God did whatever denomination ever Creed and he moved forward for these holy spirit as he promised let's proved it to us and he is alive we are the benefactors of his resurrection after being dead in the world and sin and trespasses he has quickened us together with him raised with him now it's sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus his friend is Spirit Reigns his same life again on the Earth if the spirit of God that raised up Christ the body the anointed body if the spirit of God anointed that body such a way that when that seed fell into the Earth you just wouldn't let him rest there no he quit being raised him up that same spirit by the same works by the same Power by the same signs being you he'll also raise you up I'd like to read a little scripture here for you I like before you turn to another scripture I got wrote down here it might help you a little it's found in the Book of Leviticus the 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th verse listen close in the law of levitical law God's speaking to Moses listen all these things are tight now and we'll stop here for a few moments that get into this type and the Lord spake unto Moses stand speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land which I give unto you unto the place of position that I have given unto you I used to speak to the children of Israel of Israel that when you get to this certain place that I promise you I take you when you get there and just land now speaking natural you're a type in the spiritual and shall reap the Harvest thereof you may received what I told you thereof then you shall bring a sheep of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest and ye shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you all tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it if there would be any holy ritual should come forth on the Sabbath day [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music]
