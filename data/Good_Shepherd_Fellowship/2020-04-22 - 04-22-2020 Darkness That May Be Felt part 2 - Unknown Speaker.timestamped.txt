[23:20] praise the Lord
[23:22] thinking system now
[23:24] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[23:27] tonight
[23:29] I want to read a
[23:31] [Music]
[23:34] I would start from reading reading the
[23:37] quote
[23:38] and that just one I sent out there
[23:40] tonight and
[23:42] and uh
[23:44] whom I referred to different ones but
[23:47] this is the one that I want to read
[23:50] Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[24:05] and uh
[24:07] just like we prayed and agreed each and
[24:10] every one of you out there
[24:12] and in the name of the Lord Jesus it's
[24:15] good to be in the house of the Lord
[24:17] today
[24:18] as
[24:22] our dear brother and sister
[24:24] attorney at home over you know is just
[24:27] like when David was going to bring the
[24:30] ark over you know back to his resting
[24:33] place from the from the Philistines and
[24:36] and he tried to provide a way to bring
[24:39] it and it did not work we decided to
[24:43] kept I mean keep it over in the home of
[24:46] a dear man and his wife and and I mean
[24:49] the Lord blessed him for that so we pray
[24:52] that the Lord will
[24:53] remember
[24:55] everybody Jordan and his wife and I was
[24:58] thinking about that today
[25:00] and uh
[25:03] that's that was one of the things that
[25:05] happened to her or suggest have this
[25:09] little time to pray them and remember
[25:12] you know all these different ones that
[25:14] are out there and just like I said uh we
[25:18] are all you know uh to our homes and
[25:22] different things but there are there are
[25:24] people you know doctors nurses and
[25:28] people in the science lab you know that
[25:32] are spending countless hours you know
[25:35] making research and trying to find you
[25:38] know a solution to this problem and uh I
[25:43] mean
[25:44] some of them we will we will never know
[25:47] but you know just like brother Branham
[25:49] said in the message adoption you know he
[25:51] says there's a place in heaven for the
[25:54] good doctor and I believe that all of
[25:57] these people that are making research
[26:00] you know and and everything I know there
[26:02] are a lot of things you know uh people
[26:05] report on the internet about uh you know
[26:08] the vaccine and you know and different
[26:10] things well I mean some people will
[26:13] believe it and uh you know and and some
[26:16] people it will affect them it will make
[26:18] them afraid but I believe as children of
[26:20] God you know if you believe that the son
[26:24] of righteousness has risen upon us with
[26:27] healing in his wings you know when the
[26:30] scripture says healing in his wings so
[26:32] God have different way to bring healing
[26:35] you know it's not just one win is
[26:38] healing in his wings you know he can
[26:41] heal by medical doctor by science also
[26:45] and
[26:48] Jesus said
[26:50] you know he said uh
[26:53] in sin Luke chapter 16 that's not a
[26:57] reading of the word but I just want to
[27:00] read this uh I'm jumping ahead of myself
[27:03] a little bit but that's okay he said
[27:07] uh
[27:12] it's in Luke chapter 16 verse 8 he says
[27:15] and the Lord commanded the unjust
[27:18] steward
[27:19] because he had done wisely
[27:24] for the children of this world
[27:28] are in their generation
[27:32] wiser than the children
[27:35] of light
[27:38] praise the Lord this is Jesus own word
[27:41] the children of this word
[27:45] are in dear generation wiser than the
[27:49] children of light I just wanted to read
[27:52] that why I refer to this quote that we
[27:55] want to read now before we go into what
[27:57] we want to talk about tonight
[28:00] bird Brenham uh Christ Jesus Christ the
[28:04] same yesterday he said one day say for
[28:07] instance
[28:07] the electric light
[28:10] there was a time when a man
[28:15] who taught that if they did have told
[28:18] somebody 500 years ago that they did
[28:22] have an electric light
[28:25] like that the person who have said this
[28:30] person
[28:30] was crazy
[28:33] but there was a man one time
[28:38] who down in his heart
[28:40] believe
[28:42] that there was
[28:45] he believed that there was electric
[28:48] light when he looked at the sunshine
[28:52] he looked at the the few or the kerosene
[28:56] provide light in the lantern that they
[29:00] were using those days he just believed
[29:03] you know with the different things he
[29:05] was seeing there was something that told
[29:07] him that there was a brighter light
[29:11] you know they were so bright to life
[29:15] and uh
[29:18] down in his heart he believed that there
[29:21] was
[29:22] that he could catch that electricity
[29:28] and he got a kite and a key
[29:33] and he fished it out of the scar
[29:37] and
[29:40] it runs down the stream
[29:42] and hit into the bottle and it's and and
[29:47] he stopped it up
[29:49] and he began to stream I got it I got it
[29:53] he had it but he didn't know what he had
[30:02] just remind me
[30:05] you know uh during the warning and uh
[30:09] that was around
[30:11] 1994 I can still remember
[30:14] uh uh it was uh no 1995 uh 94 I came to
[30:22] the Ivory Coast and then I spent a
[30:24] couple of months there I went back for
[30:26] uh the brothers there for us to move
[30:29] over so that was that was 1995 that was
[30:32] around February so we came and uh and
[30:36] and now remember now we were we were at
[30:38] a place where we you know there was no
[30:41] electricity you know I mean uh every
[30:44] every I mean all the infrastructure was
[30:48] destroyed there was no running water
[30:50] there was no electricity
[30:52] so uh when we came we got to the Ivory
[30:57] Coast
[30:59] in the evening it was it was night when
[31:02] uh when our bus got over there
[31:05] so when we came in the town there was
[31:08] there was a there was a family the
[31:11] brother is there we brought a toxin now
[31:12] and uh Brother Sam and the sister has
[31:17] gone to be with the Lord their little
[31:19] son uh Eric he's a big boy now and he
[31:23] looked at the street light
[31:25] and he says he says he says mama mama
[31:29] look at the fire you know
[31:33] he was born right in the time of the war
[31:35] I've never seen a street light never
[31:38] seen a ball of light hanging in the
[31:40] middle of the road you know and I I
[31:43] still remember that like yesterday you
[31:46] know his trained he says he says mama
[31:49] mama you know I mean he caught everybody
[31:51] attention he says look at the fire yeah
[31:57] that was the first time he saw he saw
[32:00] light you know and uh and and his life
[32:03] would never be the same again you know
[32:06] because there was constant electricity
[32:08] in in agriculture you know uh so I mean
[32:12] uh I mean if you tell Eric that now he
[32:15] will struggle in his mind to even
[32:17] remember that you know yeah he will
[32:20] actually struggled in his mind so
[32:22] brother Brandon saying here you know uh
[32:25] Benjamin Franklin from that from that uh
[32:28] uh experiment that he did with the cart
[32:31] and the kid and and what he felt you
[32:35] know uh the pulling of the car the
[32:37] current he fell you know uh uh uh
[32:41] something in him you know told him that
[32:44] you know uh that there was there was
[32:46] there was electricity out there and and
[32:49] he started streaming you know I got it I
[32:52] got it
[32:52] he says and brother Branham said he had
[32:55] it but he didn't know what he had
[32:59] he says and that's that's what he says
[33:04] and and uh that's what the church that's
[33:07] the matter with the church today they
[33:09] have got something
[33:11] but
[33:13] amen he says but they don't know what
[33:17] they got
[33:18] praise the Lord if we just only know
[33:21] that this word that we are hindering
[33:25] is internal life
[33:28] praise the Lord if we only know that
[33:31] this word that we are hindering that
[33:33] what we have in our hands you know just
[33:36] like Moses you know God said what do you
[33:39] have in your hand he said it was a stake
[33:40] if you only knew that that was the thing
[33:43] he was going to stretch to open the rare
[33:45] seed and that was the thing he was going
[33:47] to use to stand before pharaoh and and
[33:50] that's the matter with the church we
[33:52] have got something but don't know what
[33:56] we got now as long as he had it he could
[34:02] rejoice
[34:03] I know it's year
[34:06] I feed it I know I got it it's it's in
[34:11] here but what
[34:13] but what did he have he he didn't do
[34:16] nothing with it well then Thomas Edison
[34:20] come along after after Benjamin Franklin
[34:24] and a long come Thomas and said that he
[34:29] could make a light
[34:32] there was something now you see because
[34:36] Benjamin has caught it you know he has
[34:40] realized it
[34:42] that thing that was dwelling in The
[34:44] Invisible has touched him of Flesh
[34:49] and because he did not know what it was
[34:52] because he had touched the sword it was
[34:56] a seed that has gone through the soil
[34:59] now
[35:00] because that seed has gone to the human
[35:03] soil there will be somebody else that
[35:06] will come up and pick up from right
[35:08] there for it for their sea to come to
[35:11] life
[35:12] praise the Lord
[35:14] so Thomas come along and and he could
[35:17] make light there was something in him
[35:20] that told him that he could make light
[35:23] and help mankind now you you think about
[35:27] it now think about it when when when
[35:29] when Benjamin Franklin was thinking
[35:32] about this what actually he was thinking
[35:35] about is that uh I mean you go down the
[35:38] street during that time and you you
[35:40] could just see every house I mean you
[35:44] could count how many lanterns that were
[35:46] in the house you know if they had their
[35:48] window open you know you go down the
[35:50] street you could count how many houses
[35:52] using lamb turning and but now he's
[35:55] thinking now if if I can realize this
[35:58] you just think about it if I can realize
[36:01] this I mean uh uh they would not have to
[36:05] have two three lamps in the kitchen one
[36:07] bright light would just shine because
[36:09] what was he drawing his inspiration from
[36:12] the Sun
[36:14] he was seen drawing his inspiration to
[36:16] see how when the sun comes up it
[36:19] brightens
[36:20] you know every every word sheer the same
[36:23] light of the Sun so in his mind I mean
[36:27] there is there is something that is
[36:28] there if he can be now he's thinking
[36:31] about this to be able to help Humanity
[36:35] and brother Branham said in a spoken
[36:38] word is the Original Seed he said
[36:40] anything that will help mankind is from
[36:44] God
[36:48] anything that will help mankind is from
[36:51] God David said in the psalm he says he
[36:55] says uh bless the Lord for his wonderful
[36:58] Works to the Children of Men
[37:04] praise the Lord
[37:05] so yeah brother Branham says he says uh
[37:08] uh uh there there is something in him
[37:12] that told him that he could make he
[37:14] could make it he could make light and
[37:17] help mankind
[37:19] and so he sat at his decks for for tens
[37:24] of thousands of wire he said he tried to
[37:28] make it uh that electric uh occurring
[37:32] flow through the wire he on and on and
[37:36] on tireless hour and nights were the
[37:40] whole world many people in the world
[37:42] were sleeping many people they were so
[37:44] content with the alarm I mean there were
[37:46] new start of lamb that was coming uh
[37:48] people had all I remember those days we
[37:51] used to put oil in a little little cup
[37:53] you know the the Tomato carb we put oil
[37:56] with rocks and just put a little uh you
[37:59] know cut my James paints and just drop
[38:01] it there and you know that was steady
[38:03] light you know uh
[38:05] I mean you you just think about it you
[38:08] know uh like brother Branham says it
[38:10] takes desperation to bring sometimes
[38:12] things out of men you know when when men
[38:15] are faced with crisis like this we
[38:17] become creative praise the Lord amen I
[38:20] mean see how many people you know uh uh
[38:23] bless you have been sitting there even
[38:25] since now me facing Max and all of that
[38:27] you never thought you could do it but
[38:29] when when the knee comes there is that
[38:31] thing of almighty God in us that is able
[38:34] to bring out the best amen it's a tense
[38:37] and in thousands of why he tried the
[38:39] electric current to flow through the
[38:41] wire and on and on tireless hour night
[38:45] and people calling him crazy you know
[38:48] this guy just lock up in the room and I
[38:51] mean you go around him there's just
[38:52] different wires connecting this that
[38:54] people don't know what is it there is
[38:56] just something in his heart realizing
[38:59] that he's able to achieve this thing and
[39:01] when he hit it it will be a blessing to
[39:04] mankind
[39:05] and I I you know I just think about that
[39:08] how many doctors
[39:10] scientists even right here in Minnesota
[39:14] you know at the U of M
[39:17] Mayo Clinic
[39:19] around the world people looking for
[39:22] answers
[39:24] always can be so easy as a Believer to
[39:27] say Jesus is the answer
[39:29] but bring your Jesus to flesh
[39:32] you know the word is just like that
[39:35] little boy in the room
[39:37] as if Mama says you know
[39:39] Jesus is with you son he says mama I
[39:42] want Jesus with skin on
[39:46] praise the Lord not only Jesus with a
[39:49] word but Jesus with skin on
[39:56] praise the Lord
[39:59] tireless I was night and people calling
[40:02] him crazy and everything but there is
[40:05] something on the inside of him
[40:07] told him that that electric wood light
[40:13] something told him that those cross wire
[40:17] will Spike
[40:19] current will flow the light will shine
[40:23] and as long as there is something in the
[40:26] inside telling you that it will do it
[40:30] there is bound to be something
[40:33] there to respond to that
[40:36] God will not give you a desire you know
[40:40] I was just thinking about this today
[40:41] then and this is Wednesday anyway uh uh
[40:44] you know we can do a prayer meeting and
[40:46] and but uh just before I go to the word
[40:49] I was thinking about this I was just in
[40:51] the backyard and thinking about this
[40:53] thing about the the the lender and and
[40:57] the borrower you know you can you can
[40:58] apply that scripture in many different
[41:01] ways and what was coming to my mind is
[41:04] the other
[41:06] you know uh there are people you know
[41:09] that God just blessed with with a heart
[41:12] they want to Shield every little thing
[41:14] they have they want to share now uh you
[41:17] know
[41:18] every form of giving in one sense you
[41:20] are Lending
[41:22] even though you are not doing it with a
[41:25] mind expecting to get a return but but
[41:28] it's under God's Lord
[41:32] amen is honor a law of God that when you
[41:35] give you will receive
[41:37] so every time you give a helping hand
[41:41] you are Lending
[41:43] and when a person is also on the other
[41:46] side that also want to be the the the to
[41:50] be be on the receiving end every time
[41:53] they just want to be on the receiving
[41:55] end and uh I mean you you have put
[41:58] yourself on a on the the the natural law
[42:02] of a burial
[42:04] because you always want to receive
[42:09] praise the Lord
[42:13] because is the law that gives
[42:17] you know he's he is the giver he's the
[42:20] one that provide a promise to to provide
[42:23] all of our needs he said he have a ten
[42:26] thousand cattles on the hill
[42:29] praise the Lord
[42:30] so you see as he gives us life and he
[42:34] gave us breath
[42:37] we hold our life back to him
[42:41] because in their sense he's the lender
[42:46] the life that we have is not our own we
[42:49] are just borrowing so we owe him our
[42:51] life
[42:53] so it's not only in the sense of money
[42:57] it's not only in the sense of natural
[42:59] thing but it can be applied in many
[43:02] different ways
[43:05] so you'll find that what what I mean
[43:09] what makes the the the the early fathers
[43:12] what principle that make this country a
[43:15] blessed country I mean the principle of
[43:17] charity
[43:19] and and that principle of Charity is
[43:22] from where it's from giving because as
[43:24] much as we we give and help the ones
[43:27] that are in need in one sense we put
[43:30] ourselves under the law of the lender
[43:35] praise the Lord
[43:37] not actually expecting to get something
[43:40] back from that person but because you
[43:43] are honor the lord of the lender
[43:46] there is a promise because when the Deep
[43:48] color to the Deep there is a deep also
[43:51] to respond so God will in turn bless you
[43:55] like Jesus said it he says well what
[43:58] what is the blessing if you just do to
[44:00] them that you know them that you know in
[44:03] them that you love he says anybody would
[44:04] do that
[44:13] says as long as there is something on
[44:16] the inside telling you that
[44:20] it will be door he says there's bound to
[44:23] be something there to respond a deep
[44:26] calling to the deal as I have said often
[44:29] before the fan
[44:31] was on the Fishback
[44:34] there's a water first
[44:36] for him to swim
[44:38] all he wouldn't have had that thing
[44:43] if there is a deep
[44:45] in your calling
[44:48] there's God to be a deep
[44:51] to respawn
[44:53] praise the Lord
[44:55] so let's just uh take a portion of the
[44:58] word and read tonight second Corinthians
[45:01] chapter 4.
[45:06] second Corinthians chapter 4
[45:11] I'm staying trying to stay on
[45:16] our subject of Darkness
[45:19] that could be failed
[45:21] second Corinthians chapter four I just
[45:24] want to
[45:40] let's read from verse 3 but if our
[45:43] gospel behead
[45:45] it is hey to them
[45:47] that are lost in whom the God of this
[45:50] world have blinded
[45:52] the minds of them
[45:54] which believe next
[45:57] the light
[45:59] of
[46:00] the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[46:04] image of God should shine
[46:07] upon them
[46:10] for we preach not ourself but Christ
[46:13] Jesus the Lord
[46:15] and ourselves
[46:17] your servant for Jesus sake
[46:21] now watch this now for God who commanded
[46:25] the light to shine out of Darkness
[46:29] have shine
[46:31] in our hearts to give the light of the
[46:37] knowledge
[46:38] of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[46:43] Christ let's pray father bless this
[46:46] little portion of your word in Jesus
[46:49] name amen the Lord bless you you may
[46:52] have your seed look at the scripture
[46:54] again for God who commanded
[46:58] the light to shine out of Darkness
[47:02] have shine in our hearts to give the
[47:07] light of the knowledge
[47:10] of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[47:12] Christ now remember now we had we had a
[47:15] little uh Bible studies to do personal
[47:19] Bible studies I I would love to see what
[47:22] uh what you what you you saw on that I
[47:26] mean studying that scripture the
[47:28] darkness upon the face of the deep now
[47:30] Paul is also taking the same thing year
[47:33] he says and uh
[47:37] to give the light of the knowledge of
[47:40] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[47:43] Christ
[47:45] praise the Lord now so he's comparing
[47:49] Genesis chapter 1.
[47:52] he's comparing Genesis chapter one
[47:57] the same way God said let there be light
[48:01] he called for the light
[48:04] praise the Lord
[48:06] the Bible says Darkness was upon the
[48:09] face of the deep
[48:11] and the spirit of God move upon the face
[48:14] of the water
[48:15] now the scripture places in a way that
[48:19] Darkness was first present before God
[48:23] called for the light
[48:26] praise the Lord so here Paul now is is
[48:32] comparing what happened there
[48:35] in Genesis chapter 1
[48:38] that is the same thing that God did to
[48:41] us
[48:44] being born is seen shiplet in iniquity
[48:47] come to the word speaking lies in some
[48:50] way we were covered with Darkness
[48:53] there was a dark there was a darkness
[48:55] that was Upon Our deep
[48:59] praise the Lord
[49:01] I'm hoping that the Lord will help us
[49:03] because we I want us to to to just study
[49:07] along this line a little bit to be able
[49:10] to see because just like I said there
[49:12] are many people you think about it think
[49:14] about let me let me grab your attention
[49:16] here realize that Darkness was upon
[49:20] Egypt the people that could not even see
[49:23] their face they stretched their hands
[49:25] they couldn't see their hands there was
[49:27] light over here in Goshen and uh but
[49:31] right in Goshen was a missed multitude
[49:34] right in Goshen those people that were
[49:37] sitting under the light or the pillow of
[49:40] fire will be people that would trouble
[49:42] Moses for 40 years in the wilderness so
[49:45] they were sitting on a light but there
[49:47] was still darkness in their heart
[49:51] there were darkness in their mind they
[49:54] were sitting under the light they could
[49:56] see there is Darkness there in Egypt
[49:58] there is lighter what brought the light
[50:00] it was Moses message that brought the
[50:02] light
[50:03] it was a message that Moses preached in
[50:06] Egypt that brought the light they are
[50:08] sitting under the light they are
[50:10] traveling they're seeing the Egyptians
[50:12] coming the scene I mean they can see the
[50:14] dust in the air they look behind them
[50:16] because of the darkness they can't even
[50:18] see the terror but they can hear the
[50:20] sound of the terror they see the
[50:22] presence of God the pillar of fire is
[50:24] leading them by nine the pillow of cloud
[50:26] by day and all of these things but yet
[50:29] this will be the very same people
[50:32] that will complain they will murmur this
[50:36] would be the very same people why was
[50:38] that is because why in the presence of
[50:42] the light
[50:43] they stay hard their mind close
[50:47] they close the windows of their mind
[50:49] they close the doors of their heart the
[50:52] presence of the light that they were
[50:53] enjoying on the outside was not
[50:56] affecting them in the inside
[51:04] praise the Lord
[51:07] for God who commanded light to shine out
[51:12] of Darkness
[51:13] has shine in our heart
[51:16] praise the Lord
[51:19] amen
[51:22] I can just imagine in my mind
[51:25] Benjamin Franklin
[51:27] when he wakes up in the night or in the
[51:30] morning
[51:32] he opened his curtain
[51:34] and he looked outside his dark
[51:39] side to settings
[51:41] wait
[51:42] he keeps waiting
[51:44] to be able to see when the sun comes out
[51:47] how the darkness
[51:49] will just go away
[51:52] and he thinks about why
[51:57] why
[51:59] there is something more brighter than a
[52:02] candlestick
[52:03] there is something more brighter
[52:06] than a lamb
[52:08] you realize that in the day when the Sun
[52:12] is up to open the curtain in the house
[52:15] is brighter
[52:16] in the night when the darkness come they
[52:19] might have 12 candle lines but still the
[52:22] light is not enough
[52:30] believe we can have brighter light
[52:35] at the same way it's outside we can be
[52:38] able to experience brighter light inside
[52:40] now we have LEDs
[52:45] praise the Lord and those gentlemen
[52:47] working at the church they say they're
[52:48] going to give us LED lights hope they
[52:50] don't blind our eyes
[52:51] [Laughter]
[52:53] but he said it's going to be brighter
[52:55] than what we have we're talking about
[52:57] light here you know how more light comes
[53:01] it gets more brighter because it keeps
[53:04] out the darkness
[53:07] John chapter 1.
[53:13] it's in John chapter 1.
[53:24] in the beginning was the word
[53:28] and the Word was with God
[53:33] and the Word was God
[53:36] the same was in the beginning with God
[53:42] praise the Lord
[53:45] all things were made by him
[53:50] and without him was not anything made
[53:55] that was made
[53:57] praise the Lord now you see because we
[54:00] have traveled by grace and we have got
[54:03] teachers Through the Ages for the
[54:06] apostles and all the reformers and and
[54:09] and and in this age
[54:11] a brother brand of ministry has
[54:14] enlightened our mind with the the the
[54:17] True Light Of God when we read this
[54:20] scripture all things were made by him
[54:24] and without him was not anything made
[54:28] that was made you I mean you asked even
[54:30] some of the the kids in church they will
[54:33] tell you who was this hymn the scripture
[54:35] was talking about they would say well it
[54:37] was God they would say well I mean
[54:42] that was Jesus
[54:46] but follow me here a little bit
[54:54] just follow me in a little bit as we
[54:56] read this scripture together
[54:59] in him was life
[55:03] and the life was the light
[55:06] of men
[55:10] wherever John is testifying about he's
[55:13] testifying about that one that was in
[55:16] the beginning
[55:18] he's testifying about the one that
[55:20] called light out of Darkness that said
[55:23] let there be light and there was light
[55:27] is the one that he's talking about and
[55:30] as we travel down a little bit we
[55:32] realize here he said in the 14th verse
[55:36] and the Word was May flesh endured Among
[55:42] Us
[55:43] now so we realize here that uh uh the
[55:49] word
[55:50] let me say it like this so it will make
[55:52] sense to you their flesh
[55:57] done and it will never becomes the word
[56:05] amen the flesh
[56:08] is not the word
[56:10] the flesh will never becomes the word
[56:13] but the word will be made flesh
[56:20] praise the Lord
[56:22] so in one sense what John was testifying
[56:26] here about when he says in the beginning
[56:29] was the word and the Word was with God
[56:33] now remember he keep making emphasis on
[56:36] the word on the word on the word
[56:39] and it was that word
[56:41] that came and took on flesh
[56:45] and we call it Jesus Christ
[56:48] he says all things were made by him
[56:53] amen Jesus in a Christ in a pre-figure
[56:58] form
[56:59] all things was not made by Jesus Christ
[57:03] that was born of the Virgin but all
[57:06] things was made by the word
[57:10] their flesh will never become the word
[57:13] when when we try to be a a bit smart and
[57:18] things that you know uh we can we can
[57:21] grab the the trinitarian year and and we
[57:24] start to interpret the scripture
[57:26] immediately and say this is Jesus Christ
[57:29] you are completely out what you're doing
[57:31] here is that you are making the flesh
[57:34] the word is the word that become flesh
[57:38] is the word that takes on flesh the same
[57:41] word that takes on the Flesh of Abraham
[57:44] was the same word that take on the Flesh
[57:47] of the Patriot because God spoke about
[57:49] them for after 400 years he says I will
[57:53] come down and with a mighty hand I will
[57:56] bring them out that word become flesh in
[57:58] the life of Moses
[58:04] just like he speaks about the bride
[58:06] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[58:10] before the Great and the Dreadful Bay in
[58:13] the day of the voice of the seven angels
[58:15] that word become flesh a pick on a flesh
[58:19] of a Kentucky man
[58:21] but the flesh will never be the word
[58:28] are we together
[58:31] the flesh will never be the word so the
[58:35] same word
[58:36] that created all things
[58:39] was the same word
[58:41] that took that body like brother Brandon
[58:43] would say when he came down to Abraham
[58:45] he just took out a dust and he breathe
[58:48] it
[58:49] breathe and he and he dwared in it
[58:55] the word
[58:57] took on flesh
[59:02] and uh in first John John would testify
[59:06] he says when the world took on flesh we
[59:10] behold his glory
[59:12] as the glory of the only begotten
[59:16] what was he talking about the word took
[59:19] on flesh and we when we started seeing
[59:21] the thing that the flesh was doing the
[59:24] word in flesh was doing we behold his
[59:26] glory
[59:27] and truly we believe that this was the
[59:31] son of God
[59:35] praise the Lord
[59:37] follow my thought here now God
[59:40] Paul says that call light out of
[59:43] Darkness
[59:46] shine in our heart what why did he shine
[59:50] in our heart
[59:52] to be able to push out the darkness
[59:57] to be able to push out every Darkness
[1:00:01] because brother Branham said
[1:00:03] that God
[1:00:06] started watching over us just like he
[1:00:09] did to Abraham he promised Abraham in
[1:00:12] Genesis chapter 15 and and and uh he
[1:00:15] says after 400 years brother Branham
[1:00:17] says that kind of for lay out four
[1:00:20] generations
[1:00:22] and lay our fourth generation
[1:00:25] and that is the reason why uh uh uh when
[1:00:29] when when uh when uh when Matthew said
[1:00:32] it met Abraham
[1:00:34] and said communion to Abraham he paid
[1:00:38] Abraham paid tithe to him why Abraham
[1:00:41] was looking down after four generation
[1:00:45] of a priesthood that would come in oven
[1:00:49] it has to go from from Isaac to Jacob
[1:00:56] praise the Lord
[1:00:58] from Isaac to Jacob and over to the
[1:01:01] patriarch and then after it was out of
[1:01:04] Levi the the the priest who came so it
[1:01:06] was four generation
[1:01:11] so now all through the time of this
[1:01:14] fourth generation just like he did to
[1:01:16] Abraham is the same that he did to you
[1:01:19] and and he thought about you from the
[1:01:21] foundation of the world but at the time
[1:01:23] that your great great great fourth
[1:01:26] generation before you got here that
[1:01:28] lineage that bloodline that you were
[1:01:30] coming through when that parent was here
[1:01:32] on the earth there was something that
[1:01:35] caught his attention because he could
[1:01:37] see through the bloodline and see that
[1:01:40] he had promised for this age a Son of
[1:01:43] God that will be born a daughter of God
[1:01:45] someone that would believe his promise
[1:01:47] and stand for him in this thing
[1:01:50] but then see see the uh uh uh what we
[1:01:55] came through some of us came from
[1:01:57] parents that were that were drunk some
[1:01:59] of us came from parents that were other
[1:02:01] worship all of those Darkness all of
[1:02:04] those things I I make up the cells of
[1:02:07] our body they make up the way we behaved
[1:02:09] and the things that we suffer live and
[1:02:12] the things that trouble all of those
[1:02:14] things Darkness
[1:02:16] but right in there
[1:02:20] right in there there was a seed in the
[1:02:23] Earth
[1:02:26] Barbarian says spoken word is the
[1:02:28] Original Seed say you realize God did
[1:02:30] not planted any seed because the sea was
[1:02:33] already in the earth what he needed to
[1:02:35] do was just to call them photo life
[1:02:41] and that is the same thing that he's
[1:02:43] doing to you and myself
[1:02:47] praise the Lord
[1:02:49] sometimes we get caught up in a habit
[1:02:52] where we get so troubled about habits
[1:02:54] that uh I mean we find ourselves and we
[1:02:57] don't like it about ourselves what makes
[1:02:58] you don't like said anything about
[1:03:00] yourself is because in you it's a seed
[1:03:03] of God and that thing that you don't
[1:03:05] like about yourself you just borrow it
[1:03:08] it ran down through your genetics
[1:03:11] and that's the reason why that word that
[1:03:15] you continue to receive is shining forth
[1:03:18] in you to call you out of that Darkness
[1:03:22] the same God will call light out of
[1:03:25] Darkness has shine in our hearts
[1:03:29] he has shine in our heart the knowledge
[1:03:32] of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:03:34] that's what Paul's saying
[1:03:38] praise the Lord
[1:03:40] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:03:42] light
[1:03:45] amen the word is going through a dark
[1:03:50] period
[1:03:52] in uh in many ways this darkness is
[1:03:56] affecting people
[1:03:59] praise the Lord
[1:04:01] and even
[1:04:03] being the child of God
[1:04:05] sometimes we get
[1:04:07] you know fear across our mind
[1:04:10] when we think about different ones
[1:04:13] and we think about different situations
[1:04:16] but there's a man that can turn on the
[1:04:18] light
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:22] praise the Lord
[1:04:24] there's a man that can turn on the light
[1:04:27] and uh just like I said I want to I want
[1:04:31] to kind of for doors on this uh on this
[1:04:34] subject a little bit believing that that
[1:04:37] God will be able
[1:04:40] to help us
[1:04:42] as we go along
[1:04:46] let's look at collusion chapter one
[1:04:51] I have another
[1:04:53] another type here
[1:05:10] if you think about it
[1:05:12] Benjamin Franklin says I got it
[1:05:16] I mean he saw it but there were Shadows
[1:05:19] Of Shadows Of Shadows of what the
[1:05:22] reality was
[1:05:24] brother Branham says he got it but he
[1:05:26] did not know what he got
[1:05:28] right
[1:05:29] praise the Lord
[1:05:33] he got it he could feed it
[1:05:36] that yeah it's real this thing is it's
[1:05:39] it's moving my hands
[1:05:43] but it was shadow shadow shadow shadow
[1:05:46] away
[1:05:49] praise the Lord
[1:05:51] and that is the same thing with the
[1:05:53] believer
[1:05:55] internal life we got it
[1:05:59] Jesus said he that believeth in me
[1:06:05] is passed from Death unto life we
[1:06:08] already gathered in this body
[1:06:11] but see the different things that we go
[1:06:13] through
[1:06:20] it will be a mistake like it was in the
[1:06:22] ages there was a man that was preaching
[1:06:24] preaching the gospel on based on that
[1:06:27] scripture you know uh that you know
[1:06:29] Christians will never die you know uh I
[1:06:33] mean uh and then whenever there was
[1:06:35] there was a follower that died he would
[1:06:37] make some excuse you know and give the
[1:06:39] people their skills until when the
[1:06:42] teacher of the of you know of the
[1:06:44] doctrine died then then the doctrine had
[1:06:46] to die then the people realized that it
[1:06:48] was a false teaching
[1:06:53] because every promise of God every
[1:06:56] promise that God has given us
[1:06:59] is right in our hands we get it that is
[1:07:03] the reason why Faith becomes a very
[1:07:06] strong substance to the believer
[1:07:12] Faith bring the promises so close
[1:07:15] doubt and fear will take it the young
[1:07:18] shadows and shadows and shadows
[1:07:22] praise the Lord Collision chapter 1 Paul
[1:07:26] says here
[1:07:28] in uh
[1:07:30] verse 13.
[1:07:37] verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father
[1:07:41] which have which have made us meet
[1:07:45] to be partakers of the inheritance
[1:07:50] of the Saints in light
[1:07:54] so there is an inheritance of the sins
[1:07:56] in life we get to death but watch what
[1:07:58] he says
[1:07:59] who have delivered us
[1:08:02] from the power of Darkness
[1:08:06] and has translated us into the kingdom
[1:08:11] of his dear son
[1:08:15] in whom we have
[1:08:19] Redemption through his blood
[1:08:22] even the forgiveness of sin
[1:08:26] now so he telling us here just like he
[1:08:29] said to the Corinthians the god that God
[1:08:33] lied out of darkness is the same God
[1:08:36] that has shown for lie down in our heart
[1:08:39] but what is it
[1:08:41] you know he says he have delivered us
[1:08:45] from the power of Darkness
[1:08:48] so there is a power
[1:08:52] in darkness and it can be felt
[1:08:56] the power of Darkness can be felt
[1:09:02] praise the Lord and many that don't have
[1:09:05] this hope
[1:09:06] that we have
[1:09:09] feeling it in one way or the other
[1:09:12] and even some
[1:09:14] that have come in the presence of light
[1:09:17] came in the presence of Truth
[1:09:25] what is this Kingdom of the deer of his
[1:09:27] dear son it's a kingdom of light is just
[1:09:30] like Goshen in Egypt
[1:09:32] right praise the Lord because every
[1:09:35] Kingdom has a power
[1:09:37] if you don't have the power it would not
[1:09:39] be a kingdom
[1:09:41] amen it will not be a country
[1:09:43] I mean it has their constitution he has
[1:09:46] their power you know that govern that
[1:09:48] govern it
[1:09:49] so we realize here that uh uh
[1:09:53] Paul is making us to know there is an
[1:09:56] inheritance of the sins in light that
[1:09:59] God has brought us to an inheritance of
[1:10:02] the sins in life and things that we can
[1:10:05] we can benefit from things that we can
[1:10:07] enjoy being
[1:10:09] in This Promise being in this Kingdom of
[1:10:13] his dear son in this Kingdom of Light
[1:10:15] which what is the Kingdom Under the
[1:10:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:20] not just believing the message of the
[1:10:23] hour
[1:10:25] I mean it's it's kind of a scary
[1:10:29] when we were playing the tape on
[1:10:31] demonology
[1:10:33] I mean brother Brandon made some very
[1:10:35] very strong statements
[1:10:37] you know very very strong statement he
[1:10:39] made
[1:10:40] you know and he was talking about uh you
[1:10:43] know uh uh demon powers in the church
[1:10:47] you know you think about it what what uh
[1:10:50] what did that wish of end or her to
[1:10:53] bring up the spirit of the holy man
[1:10:59] she was now calling uh uh uh uh saw Up
[1:11:04] In The Name Of The Lord
[1:11:06] she was chanting whatever she could
[1:11:08] chant there is a power
[1:11:11] but even at that time
[1:11:14] before the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:11:16] he had an influence
[1:11:21] or the life of a Believer because Saul
[1:11:24] was one
[1:11:27] a power of Darkness
[1:11:33] I mean I'm saying all of this to bring
[1:11:35] us to the place there I mean just just
[1:11:38] coming through the church door is not
[1:11:40] enough
[1:11:42] and and sometimes you sit back and and
[1:11:45] you just see people
[1:11:47] you know you see people and and it's
[1:11:50] it's just almost like they are not
[1:11:52] giving into the world you ask yourself
[1:11:54] are they really grabbing where you are
[1:11:56] going with what you are talking about
[1:11:58] are they really seeing what I mean the
[1:12:01] the word that has been delivered what
[1:12:03] you actually you talking about
[1:12:05] because the thing about it there is that
[1:12:08] many has been around uh a preaching of
[1:12:11] the Gospel you know that make you
[1:12:13] special because you are in the message
[1:12:15] and people in the denomination they are
[1:12:18] devil they are going to hell so you just
[1:12:20] get this warm feeling because now you're
[1:12:22] in the message so you think that I mean
[1:12:25] you are okay
[1:12:27] but until this light shines right in
[1:12:30] there in your heart and it's able to
[1:12:32] push every Darkness away push every fear
[1:12:35] every doubt and and that's the thing
[1:12:37] that would bring your body in suggestion
[1:12:40] to this truth
[1:12:43] just ahead knowledge is not enough
[1:12:57] he has delivered us from the power of
[1:12:59] Darkness
[1:13:01] and he has translated us into the
[1:13:05] kingdom of his dear son
[1:13:09] that happens
[1:13:10] that's their experience we go through by
[1:13:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:17] yeah
[1:13:19] that's what that's what the believer
[1:13:21] goes through
[1:13:25] he's been cut away now you think about
[1:13:27] this
[1:13:29] Abraham
[1:13:31] he was just just a farmer
[1:13:34] just I mean uh uh sheep header and when
[1:13:38] lot was taken and the king of Sodom was
[1:13:42] taken away
[1:13:45] now these were two Nations that uh that
[1:13:49] were fighting against one another and
[1:13:51] one nation conquered another Nation but
[1:13:54] yet Abraham he was not even a nation
[1:13:57] just his household
[1:14:00] praise the Lord but what he had and he
[1:14:03] covered in he was honored it was enough
[1:14:05] to make him a kingdom because he could
[1:14:08] go out and redeem Lord now on a lot but
[1:14:11] he could bring the king of Sodom and the
[1:14:14] people of Sodom from from captive
[1:14:17] why because he was on a covenant there
[1:14:20] was a covenant that was governing him
[1:14:22] that was protecting him that was
[1:14:24] profiling strength even though he just
[1:14:27] gave the man in his house say you know
[1:14:29] uh uh maybe States and Cutlass and
[1:14:32] whatever he had
[1:14:34] and it was not what he used to actually
[1:14:38] uh uh uh deliver them
[1:14:43] it was the thought of going Library
[1:14:45] Branham says in adoption message he said
[1:14:47] it was the very top that Abraham had of
[1:14:50] glory after a fallen brother
[1:14:54] and because it was the word of God God
[1:14:57] back him up
[1:15:00] that's why God met him right after the
[1:15:03] battle was over
[1:15:06] to show that Abraham you were not in
[1:15:08] this alone I was with you
[1:15:11] because you were doing what was right
[1:15:15] the kingdom of his dear son
[1:15:19] is not an efflicted like brother Branham
[1:15:21] said he said it's a spiritual Kingdom
[1:15:24] and we come we come into it by the
[1:15:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost he has
[1:15:28] delivered us from the power of Darkness
[1:15:32] there is no grip of Fear on us yeah we
[1:15:35] can get afraid you know
[1:15:37] when teens cross our mind but there is
[1:15:39] not a great
[1:15:41] the power of darkness is one that holds
[1:15:43] one down
[1:15:46] there is not a great now the same word
[1:15:49] that is used as the power of darkness is
[1:15:53] also used
[1:15:55] and uh impeding as the chains of
[1:15:59] Darkness now you think about this hold
[1:16:01] that thought of power of darkness in
[1:16:03] your in your and and and let's look at
[1:16:06] uh second PD chapter two
[1:16:11] second Peter chapter two
[1:16:27] why people are not keeping their keeping
[1:16:31] their victory
[1:16:32] you know why people are not keeping
[1:16:35] their victory
[1:16:36] is because most of the time we just have
[1:16:39] it on the outside
[1:16:40] we don't allow that word to go through
[1:16:43] we don't allow that word to go in as to
[1:16:46] shine forth in US praise the Lord second
[1:16:49] Peter chapter 2 verse 4. this will talk
[1:16:55] about the Lord Jesus for God for if God
[1:17:00] spend that
[1:17:02] the angels that sin but cast them down
[1:17:06] to Hell
[1:17:08] and deliver them into chains of Darkness
[1:17:13] you know verbena used this in souls in
[1:17:16] prison
[1:17:16] and uh and remember now what he taught
[1:17:20] us in souls in praising he talks about
[1:17:22] the region of the Lost
[1:17:24] and the region of the bless
[1:17:28] you know because he said it was a
[1:17:30] dimension
[1:17:31] he said it was a word it's it's a region
[1:17:34] where the person could travel you know
[1:17:37] in in fear they are here on this Earth
[1:17:39] You know but they are in that region of
[1:17:42] lust because there's a chain of Darkness
[1:17:45] now also think also now to be able to
[1:17:48] put this in a place where it will
[1:17:50] balance in your mind like brother
[1:17:52] Branham says the chain of circumstance
[1:17:55] when Satan will be bound for thousand
[1:17:58] years is not a literal change
[1:18:02] that is put on his hands it's a chain of
[1:18:04] circumstance so this chain of Darkness
[1:18:10] is a power of darkness is something that
[1:18:14] is holding the people down from getting
[1:18:16] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:18] something that is holding the people
[1:18:19] down for for just living a decent life
[1:18:23] you you just think about it think about
[1:18:26] it why why should people you know uh uh
[1:18:30] I mean in the message of the hour and
[1:18:32] and I mean the feeling on the word of
[1:18:35] God and is still struggling with uh I
[1:18:38] mean with with all of these things with
[1:18:40] makeups let me take it for that for an
[1:18:42] example just struggling with all of
[1:18:45] these uh maybe the fingernail polish or
[1:18:47] you know uh struggling and they want to
[1:18:50] cut their head in they always they are
[1:18:52] always dreaming always there is
[1:18:55] something always driving to a wall this
[1:18:57] time
[1:18:59] there was just some kind of a pool in
[1:19:01] them that is always driven to the world
[1:19:03] star better animal talks are in CEO date
[1:19:06] and and people were asking about you
[1:19:08] know uh uh uh using uh uh uh weed and I
[1:19:13] mean different things I mean uh the head
[1:19:15] and uh you know for women and they have
[1:19:17] short hair and he says he says that he
[1:19:19] says that's okay just use something you
[1:19:22] know that looks natural
[1:19:25] but what is it in it that will make you
[1:19:29] know uh uh uh I mean uh
[1:19:32] there is just something of
[1:19:35] the flag there was just something in it
[1:19:37] where people were always just struggle
[1:19:40] to be driven to the side just to look
[1:19:43] different
[1:19:47] we just always want a little bit of wall
[1:19:50] at church
[1:19:55] what is that
[1:19:57] what what is holding people that they
[1:19:59] can they cannot just walk freed and step
[1:20:02] in the Liberty that God has given to
[1:20:05] them
[1:20:09] now this is this is what I'm saying here
[1:20:11] because the scripture says if our heart
[1:20:13] condemned us now
[1:20:15] we have confidence with God
[1:20:18] and then if we will be Earnest with
[1:20:20] ourselves many of the time those things
[1:20:22] that we permit there is a condemnation
[1:20:25] in our heart we know that it's not about
[1:20:29] just doing it
[1:20:31] there is something that is holding you
[1:20:33] back that's that's why I'm trying to
[1:20:36] drive to tonight there is something that
[1:20:38] is holding you back for you to be able
[1:20:40] to just step into the Liberty that God
[1:20:43] has given you the liberty of of being
[1:20:46] the Son of God the liberty of being a
[1:20:48] daughter of God
[1:20:51] why make a person to be embarrassed of
[1:20:53] their faith
[1:20:55] when they are not in church
[1:20:58] what makes them to be embarrassed what
[1:21:01] makes them to be able to to step out in
[1:21:03] the midst of friends and co-workers and
[1:21:05] and you I mean you just don't have to
[1:21:07] make yourself a fanatic just be a son of
[1:21:10] God
[1:21:19] taught us about chain of circumstance
[1:21:22] there's a power
[1:21:25] he says there are two great forces that
[1:21:28] is warring
[1:21:30] one
[1:21:32] is pulling us into the blessing pulling
[1:21:35] us into our inheritance another one just
[1:21:38] keep holding us back
[1:21:40] we always have a reason why we should
[1:21:43] not go forward
[1:21:47] a reason why we should not step on the
[1:21:49] liberty of God's world we will always
[1:21:51] make a reason and the prophet of God say
[1:21:53] in life full of excuses it's not worthy
[1:21:56] of the Gospel
[1:22:01] God
[1:22:05] the same God Paul say
[1:22:08] they're called light out of Darkness
[1:22:11] the Earth
[1:22:13] was covered with Darkness
[1:22:15] upon the Deep
[1:22:18] and he said let there be light he called
[1:22:21] light out of Darkness
[1:22:24] and when the light came the darkness
[1:22:27] disappeared
[1:22:32] he says that same God
[1:22:35] has shown for this light
[1:22:38] this light called the message of the
[1:22:40] hour is not just for knowledge it's a
[1:22:43] light that must shine forth in our heart
[1:22:51] because as we will look as we continue
[1:22:54] along we will lock the scripture over
[1:22:56] and over call us children of light
[1:22:59] and you cannot be a Child of Light until
[1:23:01] you are born of light because light will
[1:23:04] only give birth to light
[1:23:10] the scripture says we must walk in the
[1:23:12] light as he is in the light
[1:23:19] Paul says don't sleep as doors that
[1:23:23] sleep in the night because you are
[1:23:25] children of light
[1:23:27] the rich there is something about
[1:23:30] a Son of God a daughter of God
[1:23:34] that is burning inside
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:39] something that is bright inside
[1:23:43] that makes you full of Hope
[1:23:46] for a faith full of joy full of laughter
[1:24:08] a chain of circumstance
[1:24:11] a power of Darkness he has translated us
[1:24:13] from that
[1:24:15] the word has come to break that
[1:24:21] but Branham says that little boy told
[1:24:23] his sister little sister don't fear
[1:24:25] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:24:29] light
[1:24:30] foreign
[1:24:34] for this light in our heart
[1:24:38] in our heart
[1:24:43] I mean the light can shine so bright in
[1:24:46] our heart that we can see all the things
[1:24:49] some of these things you can even see
[1:24:50] them and you can trust them to your
[1:24:52] grandparents if you ever met them for me
[1:24:54] it is it's a little bit difficult
[1:24:56] because I didn't meet none of my
[1:24:57] grandparents so
[1:25:00] you
[1:25:02] had a big feet
[1:25:05] so I can trace big feedback to my
[1:25:07] grandparents
[1:25:08] you know why should I get a complex
[1:25:10] about it
[1:25:13] you know what should I get a complex
[1:25:15] about it I don't want to be like anybody
[1:25:18] else I want to be myself
[1:25:22] and that's what the light has shown for
[1:25:29] what is the thing that is holding us
[1:25:31] back
[1:25:35] I was talking with with with a sister
[1:25:39] now she's she's away from me yet and you
[1:25:42] know she she had a some things and she
[1:25:44] needed me to cancel all the ballet and
[1:25:46] we were talking from one thing to
[1:25:47] another you know and uh for some for
[1:25:51] some reason our our conversation after I
[1:25:55] you know advise on what she wanted to do
[1:25:57] and the information that she wanted and
[1:25:59] then we just we just drove a little bit
[1:26:02] into talking about different things I
[1:26:04] was asking how their little church is
[1:26:06] she goes to a Pentecostal church and I
[1:26:08] just talking to her at the church it has
[1:26:10] the pastor you know and different things
[1:26:12] we were talking and how you people you
[1:26:15] know carrying on with the service and
[1:26:16] things and you see that she's a good
[1:26:19] Christian girl and she loved the Lord
[1:26:21] and we were just talking about one thing
[1:26:23] from another I don't know how the
[1:26:24] conversation came in and then I told her
[1:26:26] I mean we started we started uh our
[1:26:30] conversation just went into
[1:26:32] into communion
[1:26:36] you know and I was you know and she was
[1:26:39] telling me Oh no well I mean the Pastor
[1:26:41] says uh you know we we are now ready for
[1:26:44] communion yet you know the church is not
[1:26:46] ready for communion yet she says but
[1:26:47] there is just something in my heart
[1:26:49] they want to you know uh they want to
[1:26:53] partake of it
[1:26:54] and she visited a message church and uh
[1:26:58] and she was around for the time of
[1:27:00] communion you know and she was just
[1:27:02] sharing that with me she says she says
[1:27:04] since that service I just had this thing
[1:27:07] in my heart now see what God did God
[1:27:11] brought her in in the light of Truth
[1:27:15] you know
[1:27:16] that makes her she want to break away
[1:27:18] now she want to experience
[1:27:21] you know so I just brought it simply
[1:27:23] down to her as his as his wealth you
[1:27:26] know by Faith by the confession of faith
[1:27:29] we we receive the Lord Jesus the Paul
[1:27:32] says by our our mouth we confess and
[1:27:35] with our heart we believe
[1:27:37] that's true but it's not enough
[1:27:40] I says what next happened the Jesus that
[1:27:44] we have received by faith we identified
[1:27:46] ourselves with him in baptism
[1:27:49] so when we go down to the water this
[1:27:52] Jesus that we have received in our faith
[1:27:54] about faith we identify ourselves when
[1:27:57] when we go there we now we identify with
[1:28:00] the body of Jesus I said but what next
[1:28:03] come again we want to partake of it
[1:28:06] you know we want to partake of the body
[1:28:09] we we want to I mean we are just just
[1:28:12] just be identified in the body not just
[1:28:15] uh taking on a name
[1:28:17] but we want to partake of it and I mean
[1:28:19] as the more we talk about it
[1:28:22] you know you could just see how the
[1:28:24] grace of God just just came down and you
[1:28:27] know and just make the subject so clear
[1:28:30] in her mind
[1:28:31] I was saying that says I don't know why
[1:28:33] I don't know why people you know Jesus
[1:28:37] said his word was the bread of life
[1:28:42] why should we think that we are we are
[1:28:46] uh uh you know qualified to be able to
[1:28:49] fee on this spiritual word
[1:28:52] and then a natural type we can what is
[1:28:54] holding people back
[1:28:57] you know it can be a darkness of
[1:29:00] tradition a darkness of uh of uh uh all
[1:29:04] teachings a darkness of seeing the
[1:29:06] darkness and all of those things but the
[1:29:09] light has shown for in our heart for us
[1:29:12] to be able to step forward
[1:29:14] God has called us to the inheritance of
[1:29:18] the sins in light
[1:29:20] they are inheritance Divine Healing joy
[1:29:24] unspeakable full of Glory
[1:29:28] God putting sounds in our heart
[1:29:31] you know I was just thinking about that
[1:29:33] as we we come to the close of this
[1:29:36] service tonight
[1:29:38] we have all of these people I keep
[1:29:41] repeating it over and over you know that
[1:29:43] are having
[1:29:45] tireless time
[1:29:50] we have not had the grace
[1:29:52] by our way of studying or God has not
[1:29:56] blessed us to be to be scientists but
[1:29:59] you think about it in this time
[1:30:02] word
[1:30:04] the whole world is shut down
[1:30:08] people are learning to be creative
[1:30:13] because we are made from a creator
[1:30:17] that is a creative
[1:30:19] power that is coming out and I'm telling
[1:30:22] you when we get out of this I mean
[1:30:24] people are just listening to a Christian
[1:30:26] radio how they have they have created
[1:30:28] games that people can play with their
[1:30:30] children Chris I mean Christian games
[1:30:33] and different things
[1:30:35] and as the Son of God as a daughter of
[1:30:38] God
[1:30:39] what are we doing with our time
[1:30:43] if that light is shining forth in our
[1:30:45] heart
[1:30:46] maybe you might say if I don't have the
[1:30:48] skill to draw I don't have the skill to
[1:30:50] to to print I don't have the skill to
[1:30:53] write a book
[1:30:57] are you spending time in prayer
[1:31:01] are you investing time in prayer are you
[1:31:03] just taking someone on your heart and
[1:31:05] just spending time
[1:31:10] everybody in this time now I mean people
[1:31:13] are are sowing Max nobody know them they
[1:31:17] just put it in the Box they send it to
[1:31:19] this Hospital
[1:31:21] they will send it over to a police
[1:31:22] station
[1:31:30] Benjamin Franklin he was he was looking
[1:31:33] to bring for life to help Humanity
[1:31:38] he said he caught it
[1:31:42] and because it was truth another man
[1:31:44] came on that inspiration
[1:31:49] you know every one of us we are turning
[1:31:51] light on in our home
[1:31:57] and it's a blessing to humanity
[1:32:01] for a matter of fact if we didn't even
[1:32:02] have electricity I would not be
[1:32:03] preaching here tonight we'll just go
[1:32:05] straight back to the book of Acts
[1:32:06] [Laughter]
[1:32:09] it will be house to house we have you
[1:32:11] have to have me in your heart before we
[1:32:13] have service yeah right
[1:32:16] but they thought that he had the
[1:32:17] inspiration he had
[1:32:19] is not a blessing to us
[1:32:21] a blessing to humanity
[1:32:25] he never knew nothing about the seventh
[1:32:27] seal
[1:32:29] he never knew nothing about Malachi 4.
[1:32:32] but yet he has something to give back
[1:32:36] to humanity
[1:32:41] I'm saying all of this to just encourage
[1:32:43] us
[1:32:45] we might not have the ability to make
[1:32:48] apps you know where people can search uh
[1:32:51] uh scripture in different things and I I
[1:32:55] share that with you the other time we
[1:32:57] had their service you know brother
[1:32:59] clever
[1:33:00] God bless that young man he I mean
[1:33:02] created I have I just spoke to him the
[1:33:05] other day and what he wanted to do was
[1:33:08] just for young people every day he sent
[1:33:09] out a Bible verse and a quote and people
[1:33:12] can comment on it you know uh and I was
[1:33:15] listening to another young man podcast
[1:33:16] or another program that he had for youth
[1:33:20] today and and I mean it's just it's just
[1:33:23] bringing that thing up
[1:33:26] if we would just use our time and feed
[1:33:31] our mind on the negative things that on
[1:33:33] the internet you are creating darkness
[1:33:36] in your heart
[1:33:38] you are calling for more darkness in
[1:33:40] your heart
[1:33:46] children of light we must spend time
[1:33:48] around things that would bring for light
[1:33:50] I may wish you a call a brother and just
[1:33:53] talk about the word
[1:33:56] actually said what have you been reading
[1:34:07] let's walk in the light
[1:34:09] as he is in the light
[1:34:13] let's be able to do something
[1:34:15] I mean something that would just make
[1:34:17] you happy that you did something that
[1:34:19] was good you feel good about it
[1:34:21] even if you have to just paint your own
[1:34:24] room paint it you know paint it blue
[1:34:26] change it painted again
[1:34:29] praise the Lord
[1:34:36] because research has also shown as
[1:34:40] people into the media world
[1:34:43] the more things that people feed their
[1:34:46] minds on from the internet
[1:34:48] they create depression for some
[1:34:52] many people get their depression and
[1:34:55] suicide thoughts from the things that
[1:34:57] they feed from
[1:34:59] the internet
[1:35:01] what is that it create more Darkness a
[1:35:04] cloud your mind nobody loved me nobody
[1:35:08] cared for me you just stuck in that word
[1:35:13] a chain of Darkness you cannot see
[1:35:16] beyond that
[1:35:18] eating all the good and kindness that
[1:35:20] people show you you will never be able
[1:35:21] to see it
[1:35:29] is a chain of circumstance it's a power
[1:35:32] of darkness and that's what Christ has
[1:35:35] come to Deliver Us from
[1:35:48] we walk in the light beautiful light
[1:35:53] come where the Dew Drop of nursing a
[1:35:55] bright

[1:36:09] Jesus Christ the light of the world
[1:36:17] let's just play their lesson there
[1:36:19] tonight as we bring this subject to an
[1:36:22] end

[1:36:33] just feeling you know sad and all of

[1:36:58] but God I call light out of Darkness he
[1:37:02] has shown for this light
[1:37:04] in our heart
[1:37:06] we can be able to use the light of God
[1:37:09] and just
[1:37:11] feel yourself on the Promises of God

[1:40:26] amen
[1:40:28] God Hashem for his life in our heart
[1:40:33] we will have our share of battles
[1:40:36] because
[1:40:37] the war that we find is a war against
[1:40:40] Darkness Paul said they are inefficient
[1:40:43] chapter 6 verse 12
[1:40:45] we're also not against flesh and blood
[1:40:47] but we fight against principalities
[1:40:51] you know we fight against all these evil
[1:40:53] forces they are all there to darken our
[1:40:56] mind to darken our heart you know to
[1:41:00] always push us in a place where we're
[1:41:03] not supposed to be
[1:41:04] that is the reason why he said we must
[1:41:07] have no communion there's no communion
[1:41:09] Lighthouse with Darkness there is no
[1:41:11] Fellowship you know there's no
[1:41:13] Fellowship in darkness whoever you see
[1:41:16] goes to fellowship and they cut all the
[1:41:18] lies off
[1:41:19] the only people that do that are people
[1:41:21] either they're planning to steal are
[1:41:23] they planning to kill all the I mean
[1:41:25] they are hiding themselves
[1:41:27] but when when when when when when when
[1:41:28] when
[1:41:29] children of light goes to Fellowship we
[1:41:32] want the place to be bright we brighten
[1:41:34] the place where music We Sing We
[1:41:36] brighten the place with with laughter we
[1:41:39] brighten the place with testimony
[1:41:42] because we are children of light
[1:41:51] God that called light out of Darkness
[1:41:53] he has shine in our heart
[1:41:57] and let that present
[1:41:59] of light glows in your heart
[1:42:02] let something
[1:42:04] either that you have done for somebody
[1:42:07] or something
[1:42:12] brother Wesley called me today
[1:42:15] and then I was talking to him on the
[1:42:17] phone and he said he said to me and he
[1:42:19] says he said brother one uh uh
[1:42:24] and we would love to share that with you
[1:42:27] I said okay I was so excited and he
[1:42:31] shared that with me and uh you know this
[1:42:33] is the cold weather Brandon was talking
[1:42:35] about you know you know a plaque with
[1:42:37] common people you know wearing masks and
[1:42:40] people using sanitizer and all of that
[1:42:43] it kind of for is I mean a kind of form
[1:42:48] uh it's just it's just edify me even
[1:42:52] though I have received the code I have
[1:42:55] read it before and I was sharing with
[1:42:57] him you know some Believers have made
[1:42:59] videos about it but here is the thing
[1:43:02] that blessed my heart is because
[1:43:05] she reading the call and they're reading
[1:43:08] the code has just put a light about the
[1:43:11] situation you know about what is going
[1:43:13] on it that portion of the word just
[1:43:16] brighten the situation you know that God
[1:43:18] knows all about this that the prophet
[1:43:21] will speak about something like this
[1:43:23] many years ago that was the thing that
[1:43:25] was edifying to me
[1:43:27] that's the way how the word
[1:43:29] Prince light
[1:43:37] when young people if young people will
[1:43:40] just call one another and and talk about
[1:43:43] what they were reading in the scripture
[1:43:47] you might not know what a young sister
[1:43:50] is going through or another young
[1:43:52] brother but as soon as you start talking
[1:43:54] about that word
[1:43:57] remember the word is light
[1:44:01] and their word is haunting for a flesh
[1:44:04] is hunting to be made flesh It's
[1:44:06] haunting for the flesh to work it's
[1:44:09] hunting for the flesh to heal it's
[1:44:11] hunting for the flesh to strengthen
[1:44:13] so if you just share a portion of the
[1:44:16] word
