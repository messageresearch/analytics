[40:01] are frozen there they're roasted but
[40:04] nonetheless it god be with us who can be
[40:08] against us yeah this morning we just
[40:11] like to speak on a subject here and
[40:15] entitled it then you ordered the new
[40:19] ministry and prophets and priests in the
[40:23] law and prophets and priests no long if
[40:27] you'll turn with me in your Bibles thank
[40:29] you my brother and we'll read there in
[40:33] Matthew 11 beginning in verse 7 and once
[40:39] again to remind you that this this
[40:41] glorious book the Bible open to us in
[40:45] these last days a book written in Psalms
[40:48] a book written in Proverbs a book
[40:52] written in allegories and visions and
[40:55] metaphors and parables only to be known
[40:58] to us by revelation is the only way we
[41:03] can understand this book only the author
[41:06] can reveal it to you only the father can
[41:10] be your mentor in your tutor to bring
[41:13] you to this great revelation to to walk
[41:16] you to help you to let your fingers do
[41:19] the walking through the Bible pages and
[41:22] not just
[41:24] comparing Scripture with Scripture but
[41:28] God bringing a revelation and letting
[41:31] scriptures dovetail and merge together
[41:34] that our eyes might be open in Matthew
[41:38] 11 verse 7 it says and as they departed
[41:42] Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
[41:45] concerning John what went ye into the
[41:48] wilderness to see a reed shaken with a
[41:52] wind but what went ye out to see a man
[41:55] clothed in soft raiment behold they that
[41:58] wear soft clothing are in King's houses
[42:01] but what went you out to see a prophet
[42:03] a I say unto you and more than a prophet
[42:08] you may be seated as we approach the
[42:14] Scriptures we remember how the Ministry
[42:18] of the Son of man came in his first
[42:20] coming we remember him I could say it
[42:23] this way the style and and method that
[42:26] the Spirit revealed to us that how he
[42:29] would declare this book of redemption
[42:32] and in Matthew 13 34 speaking there in
[42:36] the Great Sea chapter the Bible great
[42:38] teaching Jesus was bringing as was all
[42:41] of them verse 34 he says all of these
[42:45] things spake Jesus unto the multitudes
[42:49] in parables and without a parable he
[42:52] spoke not unto them so remember that red
[42:57] letters on white paper Jesus speaking
[43:00] it's always a parable it there's a
[43:04] mystery hidden in that word of God that
[43:08] he's willing and ready to reveal to you
[43:10] if you're willing and ready to receive
[43:12] it he said and verse 35 Matthew he said
[43:20] that it might be fulfilled which was
[43:23] spoken by the Prophet saying I will open
[43:26] my mouth in parables I will utter things
[43:28] kept secret from the foundation of the
[43:31] world so this morning as every morning
[43:35] that the Word of God would be open
[43:37] things are going to be uttered that have
[43:40] been kept secret since the foundation of
[43:42] the world here within the walls of this
[43:46] little building you will be hearing
[43:47] things that the world has read but never
[43:50] heard things that the world has seen and
[43:55] yet the eyes of their understanding have
[43:58] never been open but it's given to you
[44:01] this morning Matthew 11 9 says but what
[44:06] went ye out to see a prophet yea I say
[44:08] unto you and more than a prophet a
[44:11] change is prophesied in this prophetic
[44:14] ministry that aren't in truth there are
[44:17] into introduced Messiah the Lion of the
[44:20] tribe of Judah the Lamb of God a prophet
[44:23] is required and more than a prophet
[44:27] remember the prophetic ministry it isn't
[44:30] something that came to an end in the
[44:32] days of John the Baptist it's something
[44:37] that God spoke in a parable to confound
[44:40] the eyes of the wise and prudent and yet
[44:43] what took place was a change
[44:46] ohhow change is so difficult for us oh
[44:50] how turning a corner is so treacherous
[44:54] in the spiritual realm oh how we try to
[44:58] avoid it look we've never walked this
[45:01] way before
[45:01] oh but this morning put your hand in his
[45:05] hand this morning so what change is
[45:08] prophesied matthew 11 and 10 for this is
[45:12] Kiev whom it is written behold I send my
[45:15] messenger before thy face which shall
[45:17] prepare thy way before thee John had
[45:21] more than one ministerial gift a
[45:24] messenger to a new dispensation yeah
[45:27] quite quite a controversial subject in
[45:31] itself can a man have more than one
[45:35] ministerial gift and immediately
[45:39] well-studied been in the message said a
[45:41] prophet said he says he he says I am I
[45:47] an evangelist I'm not a prophet am i
[45:49] what am i I can't be
[45:51] both at the same time you can't mix
[45:53] ministries and yet God started me as an
[46:02] evangelist God did that God made him a
[46:05] pastor later God did that God made him
[46:11] apostille to the nation's God did that
[46:15] God made him a prophet to the bride of
[46:18] Jesus Christ God did that William
[46:25] Branham a man didn't want that to be
[46:29] that way Lord just let me do one little
[46:32] thing and but his was to be an example
[46:37] ministry he was more than a prophet he
[46:42] was a messenger to the aged he was an
[46:45] angel too loudly Seiya John had more
[46:53] than one ministerial gift a messenger to
[46:56] a new dispensation a forerunner to
[46:59] introduce Christ at his first coming a
[47:02] prophet to the nation of Israel in a
[47:07] time of great change not to bring them
[47:10] the law but to bring him the word made
[47:13] manifest to bring him the word flesh and
[47:15] to declare it to Israel you see Israel
[47:18] did not reject the law under rituals and
[47:21] the shadows Israel rejected the revealed
[47:25] Word that had been come flashing Matthew
[47:29] 11:11 says verily I say unto you among
[47:32] them that are born of women there are
[47:34] not risen or greater than John the
[47:36] Baptist
[47:36] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[47:39] kingdom of heaven is greater than him
[47:41] and from the days of John the Baptist
[47:44] till now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
[47:47] violence and the violent take it by
[47:51] force
[47:56] here in
[47:57] scripture of Matthew 11 was prophecy
[48:01] unfolding John came at the time of a
[48:08] overlap of Ages the last Jewish age
[48:13] Israel had seven Church ages look it up
[48:18] you'll find it I won't tell you at the
[48:24] last age and dispensation of Israel
[48:27] seven church ages and the beginning of
[48:29] the first dispensation the first church
[48:32] vision church age in that overlap comes
[48:35] a messenger of Prophet and more than a
[48:37] prophet John the baptism to introduce
[48:39] the first coming of Christ in that
[48:43] overlap the first seal opened and under
[48:47] that first seal come Jesus Christ come
[48:52] the Elijah ministry and from the days of
[48:55] John the Baptist until now the Kingdom
[48:59] of Heaven suffereth violence and the
[49:02] violent take it by force as a young boy
[49:08] growing up in the Pentecostal
[49:10] denomination the pasta-like church the
[49:14] typical interpretation of what this was
[49:17] this is the sons of God and children of
[49:20] God taking the kingdom of God from the
[49:26] days of John the Baptist of the Kingdom
[49:28] of Heaven suffereth violence and the
[49:32] violent take it by force and yet Isaiah
[49:37] 53 was the Old Testament prophecy of the
[49:42] opening of the first seal speaking of
[49:45] Jesus as a twelve-year-old boy through
[49:47] the cross to the grave that he would be
[49:50] buried in and it's spoken of him the
[49:55] head of the church Jesus himself Isaiah
[49:58] said in their prophecy and in him is
[50:01] found no violence
[50:06] so now scripture crashes how can out his
[50:12] followers be violent when the founder
[50:17] himself in him is found no violence so
[50:21] this must be someone else you remembered
[50:26] revelation 6:1 and to open in the first
[50:30] seal that white horse rider with a bow
[50:35] in his hand and he came conquering and
[50:40] to conquer conquering and to conquer and
[50:48] here in John the Baptist in the days of
[50:53] John the Baptist until now the kingdom I
[50:56] haven't suffered violence and the
[50:59] violent take it by force the first seal
[51:03] had been ripped off
[51:07] and the Son of man is standing present
[51:11] the Lamb the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[51:15] a great Redeemer Almighty God descended
[51:24] in flesh
[51:27] bringing to Israel an open book bring
[51:32] into Israel Redemption bringing the fig
[51:35] tree to redemption the firstborn and
[51:40] when the firstborn rejects the revealed
[51:43] word then who inherits a Gentile people
[51:49] it's given to the Gentiles the reveal
[51:51] word the word made flesh all happening
[51:56] here in Matthew 11 at the open in the
[52:01] first sealed Elisha comes on the scene
[52:05] and in the days of Elijah the first
[52:08] rider begins and the first seal is open
[52:11] and redemption is given to God's people
[52:17] and when Israel rejects it it's given to
[52:25] you and I and the consummation of the
[52:29] rejection is according to the prophecy
[52:32] and the allegory 4000 years before when
[52:39] Joseph brings his two sons to Jacob a
[52:42] blind old man it was the ritual in their
[52:51] custom and a proverb in Israel you take
[52:56] your sons to be blessed of the great
[52:58] patriarch and Joseph positions him
[53:01] because he realizes his father's not
[53:04] able to know which is which he said I'm
[53:09] gonna make this easy for the old guy he
[53:13] puts the eldest as his right hand the
[53:15] younger set his left and this blind old
[53:18] man goes to give the blessing and he
[53:19] crosses his hands hallelujah the
[53:25] blessing of the revealed word that came
[53:27] to Israel at the cross of Calvary was
[53:31] consummated it goes to a Gentile people
[53:34] now to you and I to give us hope to give
[53:38] us Redemption because he knew amongst
[53:40] all these Gentile people savages were
[53:43] the clothes on our back that down inside
[53:45] of their heart was a seed predestinated
[53:48] before the foundation of the world and
[53:56] that seed would grow
[54:01] through a character-building process
[54:04] called the three steps of grace and the
[54:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Father
[54:11] adopting you and I through a personal
[54:15] experience with Jesus Christ taking us
[54:18] unto perfection a body change for our
[54:24] faith will quicken us translators
[54:27] changes by the power of the Holy Spirit
[54:31] rapturing faith a prophet says we hardly
[54:35] have faith for a headache we need faith
[54:38] to be changed in a moment in the
[54:41] twinkling of an eye Matthew 11 the
[54:48] opening of the first seal the beginning
[54:52] of the first rider it begins that day
[54:59] these scriptures were unfolding Matthew
[55:08] 1113 for all the prophets and the law
[55:12] prophesied until John in Luke 16 and 16
[55:18] it reads again it says the law and the
[55:21] prophets were until John since that time
[55:25] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[55:28] man presses into it and of course it has
[55:34] become a favorite scripture of many
[55:37] whose eyes are still beholden and they
[55:39] say you see after John no more prophets
[55:45] because the law and the prophets were
[55:48] until John no more prophets right nor
[55:53] just like they tell you jesus said be
[55:56] baptized in the name of the Father the
[55:58] Son of the Holy Ghost who better than
[56:01] Jesus to believe and yet it takes a
[56:08] revelation
[56:09] but what he spoke he spoke in a parable
[56:12] he spoke things to us that were hidden
[56:15] since the foundation of the world but
[56:18] all in a parable but to his children
[56:21] he's ready to take you aside anytime you
[56:25] ask him and say Lord what meaneth this
[56:31] and why did you speak in the parable no
[56:35] one understood it's that for them for
[56:39] its pleased me father I thank you that
[56:42] you've hidden these things from the eyes
[56:44] of the wise and prudent and revealed it
[56:46] unto babes as such as would learn the
[56:51] law and the prophets were until John
[56:53] since that time the kingdom of God is
[56:56] preached and every man presses into it
[56:58] what was being preached was about to
[57:01] change no more law John had come at the
[57:04] end of the Jews seven church age but he
[57:08] was really a prophet of a new
[57:09] dispensation of a new message of the
[57:13] dawning of a new day he's introducing
[57:16] the Lamb of God not the shadow but the
[57:22] reality the man that God was looking for
[57:28] the man that the strong angel was
[57:31] looking for it he needed a man forehead
[57:34] to be a kinsman kin to you and I to do
[57:38] this work of redemption and when he
[57:40] found no men the angel of the cup in God
[57:44] and that form descended again he became
[57:47] the man he became the lamb he's
[57:55] introducing the Lamb of God he's to lay
[57:58] the foundation for the Lamb of God to
[58:00] minister perfection predestination the
[58:05] three steps of grace adoption serpent
[58:09] seed the seven seals
[58:10] John was laying a foundation for Jesus
[58:13] to do these things that he did Jesus
[58:20] preached
[58:22] breathe Jesus preach predestination
[58:26] Jesus preached a serpent seed it's in
[58:32] your Bibles Jesus preached the
[58:35] revelation of the seven seals a New
[58:45] Testament a 20th century prophet told us
[58:48] all these things it's all laying in the
[58:50] word preach the opening of the book
[58:56] according to revelations 5 all the
[59:01] mysteries of God hidden since the
[59:04] foundation of the world at the first
[59:08] coming of Christ it was all laid in the
[59:12] word like a great master builder like
[59:17] David laid all the materials for the
[59:20] building of the temple solemn Solomon
[59:24] gathered none of it Solomon had it
[59:29] assembled but David brought it all the
[59:34] artisans together to craft it that not a
[59:39] hammer would be heard in the house of
[59:41] God no sounds of works in the house of
[59:47] God no sounds of carrying to build
[59:53] something in the house of that it be a
[59:58] silent work it be a quick work a temple
[1:00:04] built maybe in about the space of a half
[1:00:06] hour in the message the evening
[1:00:13] messenger other man says east messenger
[1:00:17] had his message and the message in the
[1:00:20] messenger and it's most remarkable we
[1:00:23] found in the church age Istomin tonight
[1:00:25] we'll go back to the Old Testament and
[1:00:26] find that it's the same thing that God
[1:00:28] sends the messenger of that age at the
[1:00:30] end of time always at the end
[1:00:34] never at the beginning at the end so
[1:00:40] then you find wonderful people saying
[1:00:42] you see it must be very late because
[1:00:46] William Branham came at the end of laude
[1:00:49] Seiya something happened for some reason
[1:00:55] they stopped reading they they had to go
[1:00:57] to work there to go to school there to
[1:01:01] finish washing the dishes and they're
[1:01:05] happy to know this something they didn't
[1:01:08] know before but had they gone a few more
[1:01:11] minutes they would have read now as
[1:01:13] Luther's age faded out then Wesley came
[1:01:17] in and when Wesley sanctification faded
[1:01:20] out Pentecostal age come in it's always
[1:01:23] the messenger opens up the new message
[1:01:25] at the end of the old it's each page
[1:01:29] that that's been done we know that to be
[1:01:33] the truth so now more detail was added
[1:01:37] to a statement and now realized they
[1:01:41] come at the end but they come at the end
[1:01:43] of the previous age in the overlap as
[1:01:46] John the Baptist and Jesus come in the
[1:01:51] overlap between Jewish and Gentile ages
[1:01:55] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:01:59] and forever unchanging in all of his age
[1:02:03] one of the keys that was given to Peter
[1:02:06] that day Peter flesh and blood has not
[1:02:10] revealed this to you but my father which
[1:02:12] is in heaven and upon this rock I'll
[1:02:15] build my church in Minneapolis and the
[1:02:19] gates of Hell will prevail against it
[1:02:24] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:02:27] and John was the beginning of a New
[1:02:30] Testament ministry a new message once
[1:02:34] again he came out of the wilderness but
[1:02:36] he never went back again like the
[1:02:38] prophets of old once he came out of the
[1:02:41] wilderness he stayed and he died amongst
[1:02:45] the people
[1:02:46] unlike the Old Testament wave prophets
[1:02:51] would rush in with thus sayeth the Lord
[1:02:52] bring judgment by the time you turned
[1:02:54] around they were gone they were gone
[1:03:03] Matthew 11:14 and if you will receive it
[1:03:07] this is Elias which was for to come not
[1:03:12] only had the message change John's
[1:03:15] ministry had changes in it
[1:03:17] he's Isaiah 40 he was Malachi 3 it was
[1:03:24] Luke 113 and 7
[1:03:26] he was Malachi 4 5 and 6 a prophet as
[1:03:35] you hear the message and hear him speak
[1:03:39] you usually hear him say now Malachi 4 5
[1:03:43] and 6
[1:03:43] that wasn't John because you see when
[1:03:49] that one man comes the earth will be
[1:03:51] burnt up and he said that for many years
[1:03:58] 1961 in a message I believe called
[1:04:01] Messiah he said that he was back in
[1:04:04] Indiana and the Lord told him go back to
[1:04:06] that place that you called go back to
[1:04:12] that place there were you killed the
[1:04:16] squirrels he says I'm gonna speak
[1:04:23] so that went back I back in that area
[1:04:27] you wait on God half hour past and mourn
[1:04:33] finally the Holy Spirit spoke to him and
[1:04:37] revealed to him that Malachi four five
[1:04:41] and six was both first and second coming
[1:04:43] and that John had fulfilled the first
[1:04:45] part a prophet just three four years
[1:04:53] from his ministry ending and God had
[1:04:58] just opened that to him he must have
[1:05:02] held it back for a reason and then
[1:05:06] revealed it to him in his latter years
[1:05:09] perhaps it was to hide it from the eyes
[1:05:14] of the wise and prudent and reveal it
[1:05:17] unto babes
[1:05:18] such as would learn those who would go
[1:05:24] looking into the Word of God those who
[1:05:29] have before them messages 1200
[1:05:34] messengers to teach us a lesson that if
[1:05:41] it's one scripture or one quote slow
[1:05:47] down don't run with the message yet seek
[1:05:54] you first the face of God see if there's
[1:05:58] any changes see if there's any corners
[1:06:00] that have been turned because it's not a
[1:06:05] mistake
[1:06:07] it's God
[1:06:11] it's God once again in the Ministry of a
[1:06:14] son of man speaking in Proverbs and
[1:06:18] parables to his people to hide it to
[1:06:24] give it just to you Isaiah 40 in one has
[1:06:31] comfort he comfort my people say if your
[1:06:34] God speak you comfortably to Jerusalem
[1:06:36] and cry unto her that her warfare is
[1:06:38] accomplished that her iniquity is
[1:06:41] pardoned for she have received of the
[1:06:44] Lord's hand double for all her sins o
[1:06:50] unlikely message for an Old Testament
[1:06:53] prophet but for a prophet of a new
[1:06:56] covenant for a prophet no longer no
[1:06:59] longer under the Lord no more in the
[1:07:04] enemies club we now have faith for our
[1:07:09] victory we can move mountains
[1:07:16] speak to me comfortably to Jerusalem
[1:07:19] John cry unto her tell her her warfare
[1:07:24] is accomplished redemption is here
[1:07:28] salvation is here the Holy Ghost is here
[1:07:32] the born-again experience is here her
[1:07:42] iniquity is pardoned for she has
[1:07:46] received of the Lord's hand double for
[1:07:48] all her sins the voice of him that cry
[1:07:51] in the wilderness prepare ye the way of
[1:07:54] the Lord that when he comes he can speak
[1:07:58] better things to you than what the blood
[1:08:00] of abel spoke he can speak to you
[1:08:05] through the blood of Christ a blood that
[1:08:10] can wash your sins away
[1:08:12] a blood that can make you a new creature
[1:08:15] in Christ I say a 14 verse 5 and the
[1:08:24] glory of the Lord shall be revealed so
[1:08:28] the time of John's coming as a prophet
[1:08:30] was also a time of great revelation so
[1:08:34] time when God would be revealing great
[1:08:36] things to his people a glory of the Lord
[1:08:41] shall be real all flesh shall see it
[1:08:43] together for the mouth of the Lord has
[1:08:46] spoken it this was one fold of his
[1:08:49] ministry John the voice of God in his
[1:08:52] day no one else in the day of this
[1:08:55] revealing it if you rejected John you'd
[1:09:00] probably reject Jesus Malachi 3:1 to
[1:09:06] behold
[1:09:07] I'll send my messenger John again
[1:09:10] scripture dovetailing with scripture
[1:09:14] adding more detail to the Ministry of
[1:09:16] this man and if it was so then wouldn't
[1:09:22] it be so today behold I'll send my
[1:09:25] messenger he shall prepare the way
[1:09:26] before me and the Lord whom you seek
[1:09:28] shall suddenly come to his temple even
[1:09:31] the messenger of the Covenant whom you
[1:09:34] delight in behold he shall come saith
[1:09:38] the Lord of Hosts it was a time of a
[1:09:41] great change and a promise Malachi
[1:09:45] speaking of this coming of this
[1:09:48] forerunner of this Elijah ministry of
[1:09:51] this messenger who would forerun make
[1:09:54] away before the Lord Himself
[1:09:57] can it says and he shall prepare the way
[1:10:00] before me and the Lord whom you seek
[1:10:04] shall suddenly come to his temple that
[1:10:09] temple was a spoken word seed in the
[1:10:14] womb of a virgin
[1:10:17] hidden in a prophetic parable of the
[1:10:23] messenger and Christ himself and how he
[1:10:27] would come and where he would come to
[1:10:31] he'd have a temple prepared for him now
[1:10:34] one made with hands but a spoken word
[1:10:37] temple that the fullness of the Godhead
[1:10:41] deed of deity would he come down
[1:10:43] descended and abide in and grow now God
[1:10:48] had a man that would take him at his
[1:10:50] word Malachi 3:3 and he shall sit as a
[1:11:01] refiner and purifier of silver and he
[1:11:04] shall purify the sons of Levi and purge
[1:11:07] them as gold and silver that they may
[1:11:10] offer unto the Lord and offering in
[1:11:13] righteousness because prior to his
[1:11:16] coming the sons of Levi were no longer
[1:11:20] doing this they were wrapped up in one
[1:11:26] of the biggest denominations only Rome
[1:11:31] was more powerful than them and yet they
[1:11:34] United together to crucify him that day
[1:11:39] on Calvary and he had come to purify
[1:11:43] them they hold the second fold of this
[1:11:46] new ministry no more under the law Luke
[1:11:51] 1 in 13 but the angel said unto him
[1:11:54] speaking to Zechariah you all remember
[1:11:57] the story of Zechariah and Elizabeth in
[1:11:59] the Book of Luke and verse 13 he says
[1:12:02] but the angel said unto them fear not
[1:12:04] Zechariah for thy prayer is heard and
[1:12:07] thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[1:12:10] and thou shalt call his name John thou
[1:12:12] shalt have joy and gladness and many
[1:12:14] shall rejoice at his birth for he shall
[1:12:17] be great in the sight of the Lord and
[1:12:19] shall drink neither wine nor strong
[1:12:22] drink he shall be filled with the Holy
[1:12:25] Ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:12:28] the beginning of a new ministry the
[1:12:35] beginning of a new protocol for
[1:12:37] Ministers the beginning of a new
[1:12:42] prophetic ministry introducing Christ
[1:12:48] even his natural birth had to be a
[1:12:50] certain way even him Gabriel said don't
[1:12:59] drink don't smoke don't defile your body
[1:13:01] John because when you get older I have a
[1:13:04] work for you to do but Lord I'm still in
[1:13:08] the womb
[1:13:08] I said when you get older Johnny when
[1:13:11] you get older I said anybody been there
[1:13:19] before in the womb and yet God was then
[1:13:21] speaking to you when you get older I've
[1:13:25] got a work for you to do in Minneapolis
[1:13:35] where he shall be great in the sight of
[1:13:37] the Lord and shall drink neither
[1:13:38] wine nor strong drink and he shall be
[1:13:40] filled with the Holy Ghost from his
[1:13:42] mother's womb see the order of the new
[1:13:44] ministry so they can take the head of
[1:13:48] every home by example into the same
[1:13:52] ministry a postal prophet bastard
[1:13:59] evangelist teacher Deacon Sunday school
[1:14:04] teacher you've got something to do in
[1:14:10] this great plan of redemption you play
[1:14:13] an important part each and every one
[1:14:18] from the smallest the youngest to the
[1:14:22] oldest and most people
[1:14:26] what wants to give you your own
[1:14:28] testimony to be a witness for him verse
[1:14:37] 16 of Saint Luke chapter 1 and many of
[1:14:42] the children of Israel he shall turn to
[1:14:46] the Lord their God and he shall go
[1:14:48] before him in the spirit and power of
[1:14:52] Elijah to turn the hearts of the
[1:14:55] father's to the children and the
[1:14:58] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[1:15:01] make ready a people prepared for the
[1:15:05] Lord
[1:15:05] Gabriel was connecting the dots now
[1:15:08] Gabriel had just connected John to the
[1:15:12] prophecy of Malachi and that he would
[1:15:16] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:15:18] children
[1:15:19] , and the hearts of the children to the
[1:15:24] father's know first coming of Christ the
[1:15:32] first forerunner the first Elijah so 1
[1:15:36] comma makes the difference in prophecy
[1:15:42] to be fulfilled more than 2,000 years
[1:15:46] apart and yet it's thus saith the Lord
[1:15:50] it's coming it's spoken he said it it's
[1:15:53] going to happen for you and I and he
[1:15:58] opened their eyes to see things passed
[1:16:00] so their eyes can be open to see things
[1:16:03] present to see he's the same yesterday
[1:16:06] today and forever I'm changing in all
[1:16:09] his ways angel Gabriel was quoting the
[1:16:16] spoken word of God that Israel only knew
[1:16:20] as the writings of the Prophet Malachi I
[1:16:26] don't know if Gabriel could even read
[1:16:29] being an angel
[1:16:32] but he didn't know he didn't have to
[1:16:34] because he got it lip to hear yes do you
[1:16:42] need to be an angel to get it lip to
[1:16:44] hear or let me remember did it ever
[1:16:48] happen to a human being on the face of
[1:16:51] the earth yeah ha ha and if it happened
[1:16:56] once could it happen again
[1:16:58] and it happened in the past could it
[1:17:00] happen this morning
[1:17:01] Oh Matthew 11:15 either had ears to hear
[1:17:09] let him hear
[1:17:11] but we're on to shall I liken this
[1:17:14] generation it is like unto children sit
[1:17:17] in the markets and calling them to their
[1:17:18] fellows saying we have piped unto you
[1:17:21] and you have not danced we have mourned
[1:17:24] unto you you have not demented you see
[1:17:27] the children of this world will find
[1:17:31] fault in every thing you do then they
[1:17:39] said we piped unto you you haven't
[1:17:42] danced okay so with more than Q now and
[1:17:46] you haven't lamented you people stand
[1:17:52] solid like the Rock of Gibraltar I don't
[1:17:56] get it because there's something within
[1:17:59] us that's holding all the song said
[1:18:04] there's something within me I just can't
[1:18:07] explain but there's something within us
[1:18:11] a seed sown growing unto the statue of a
[1:18:19] perfect man the son of man came eating
[1:18:23] and drinking and they say behold a
[1:18:26] gluttonous man a wine-bibber a friend of
[1:18:28] publicans and sinners but wisdom is
[1:18:30] justified of her children the children
[1:18:34] of God need the wisdom of God so that
[1:18:38] you won't follow a man
[1:18:41] but you'll follow the man yes God has a
[1:18:49] fivefold ministry but due respect every
[1:18:53] one of them don't follow the man at the
[1:19:00] end of the Jewish Ages there was a
[1:19:02] promise of a new ministry to introduce
[1:19:05] and forerun the coming of Christ Isaiah
[1:19:10] 7:14 Scripture well-known to us it says
[1:19:13] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:19:15] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[1:19:17] conceive and bear a son and call his
[1:19:20] name Immanuel butter and honey shall he
[1:19:24] eat that he may know how to refuse the
[1:19:27] evil and choose the good there it is a
[1:19:31] principle for you as a mom and dad
[1:19:35] raising your children
[1:19:40] someone might tell you those kids nett
[1:19:43] need to go out and sow a few Wild Oats
[1:19:47] and get that out of their system it's a
[1:19:55] lie of the devil
[1:19:59] the truth is see them butter and honey
[1:20:04] of the word raise up a child in the way
[1:20:09] he should go and when he gets older
[1:20:13] he'll refuse the evil and choose the
[1:20:16] good that's been sown in his heart for
[1:20:22] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:20:26] given and the government shall be upon
[1:20:28] his shoulder and his name shall be
[1:20:31] called wonderful counsellor the mighty
[1:20:33] God the everlasting father the Prince of
[1:20:37] Peace not the Prince of violence at the
[1:20:43] opening of the first seal at the first
[1:20:46] coming of Christ
[1:20:48] there they stood both again in the
[1:20:53] Ministry of John it brings up peace and
[1:20:57] the Prince of violence the white horse
[1:21:02] rider in Jesus Christ the Lamb of God
[1:21:11] Isaiah 53 all of these Old Testament
[1:21:17] prophecies are the Old Testament
[1:21:19] prophecies of the opening of the first
[1:21:22] seal yet we didn't know him as such but
[1:21:30] we do now there was redemption it was a
[1:21:35] book being opened it was a time of
[1:21:37] Revelation Isaiah 53 starts like this
[1:21:41] who have believed the message of the
[1:21:46] hour who had believed our report that's
[1:21:51] a message and to whom is this revelation
[1:21:58] given of this message of this hour of
[1:22:02] the revealed Word Isaiah 40 and 5 was a
[1:22:09] time of revealing who read it Isaiah 53
[1:22:12] a time of revealing both speaking at the
[1:22:16] same time
[1:22:18] revelations 5 and 5 to 70 is the same
[1:22:22] time a time of revealing revelation 6 is
[1:22:28] a time of the book being opened by Jesus
[1:22:31] himself scripture dubbed daily details
[1:22:38] coming together to open the eyes of our
[1:22:43] understanding as Paul spoke microfiber
[1:22:49] and to speaking of the same time even
[1:22:56] the prophets of old didn't know what
[1:22:59] they were saying even John as he was
[1:23:04] given the visions of the book of
[1:23:05] Revelation couldn't wrap his mind around
[1:23:08] what he was seen
[1:23:14] but thou Bethlehem Ephrathah though thou
[1:23:17] be little among the thousands of Judah
[1:23:19] yet out of thee shall come forth unto me
[1:23:23] that is to be ruler in Israel whose
[1:23:26] going forth have been from old from
[1:23:30] everlasting
[1:23:32] but the scripture speaks of this
[1:23:34] prophetic ministry there was introduced
[1:23:37] Messiah King of the Jews Lion of the
[1:23:41] tribe of Judah Luke 167th says this
[1:23:46] speaking on John Zechariah and his
[1:23:49] father Zechariah was filled with the
[1:23:52] Holy Ghost and prophesied prophesied
[1:23:56] saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[1:24:00] for he has visited and redeemed his
[1:24:02] people once again a time of revealing
[1:24:06] the opening of the word a book being
[1:24:11] opened seven seals being loosed we
[1:24:17] sometimes think no stop a minute that's
[1:24:20] 1963 oh no he wasn't
[1:24:29] William Branham and opened the book it
[1:24:33] was Jesus Christ
[1:24:34] it was the Lamb of God William Branham
[1:24:43] only brought us the revelation to tell
[1:24:45] us it's open so much controversy and God
[1:24:52] once again sent a prophet to tell us
[1:24:54] it's open and as you read from 1963
[1:25:01] after he preached the seals and he keeps
[1:25:04] telling us it won't be a public affair
[1:25:09] he's lining up scriptures when asked
[1:25:13] about revelations 8:1 the seventh seal
[1:25:16] he says that's what revelations tens all
[1:25:18] about so all of a sudden took
[1:25:20] revelations 8:1 with no detail connects
[1:25:24] it to revelations 10
[1:25:26] now he's added eleven verses of detail
[1:25:29] to the 7cm and he goes on like this till
[1:25:34] 1964 in feast of the trumpets we who
[1:25:41] believe it's open by the things he said
[1:25:44] he makes a statement and as he's talking
[1:25:48] our paragraph 167 he says oh and the
[1:25:54] Seventh Seal hasn't been open yet and
[1:26:02] the brother that you've been with
[1:26:03] opposing sides on immediately your phone
[1:26:06] rings what do you think of that quote
[1:26:09] for the Daniel I said well if he said it
[1:26:14] I like it if you said I like it then I
[1:26:24] hang up the phone I go to digging
[1:26:28] buh-bye buh-bye quote and seven months
[1:26:34] to the day in 1965 a message called
[1:26:41] marriage and divorce if that one means
[1:26:44] anything to you
[1:26:46] he says all seven seals are open that's
[1:26:53] why we have today the mysteries of
[1:26:55] marriage and divorce and Surrency
[1:26:57] predestination - er change fate for a
[1:27:01] rapture and the following three or four
[1:27:06] messages continues to say it's open the
[1:27:09] word reveal it's open the word revealed
[1:27:16] so the question is what in the world did
[1:27:20] he have in July of 65 and he still white
[1:27:27] didn't have in December of 64 a
[1:27:37] revelation
[1:27:41] he's a prophet he told us God don't tell
[1:27:46] his prophets everything Jess what he
[1:27:49] wants him to know and what he wants him
[1:27:52] to say and when he wants him to say it
[1:27:56] once again the message the Ministry of a
[1:28:00] sin of men in total control of the
[1:28:05] Ministry of the Son of Man and he's
[1:28:09] making him speak in Proverbs like Jesus
[1:28:14] of Nazareth get the first coming now the
[1:28:19] revealed words being written in the
[1:28:22] second coming as it wasn't the first and
[1:28:28] he's showing us it will not be an
[1:28:30] explanation
[1:28:32] it must be a revelation
[1:28:35] it must be revealed to you you must see
[1:28:40] it with the eyes of your understanding
[1:28:43] you must hear it with your heart
[1:28:50] Luke 169 and has raised up a horn of
[1:28:55] salvation for us in the house of his
[1:28:58] servant David as he spoke by his holy
[1:29:00] prophets which had been since the world
[1:29:04] began now we know where this prophetic
[1:29:09] ministry began Zechariah anointed of the
[1:29:17] holy ghost says as he spake them by the
[1:29:23] mouth of his holy prophets which have
[1:29:25] been since the world began this is the
[1:29:29] divinely revealed mystery truth God
[1:29:32] ordained the prophetic ministry since
[1:29:35] the world began Adam Abel Enoch
[1:29:41] no what the list goes on it had a
[1:29:44] beginning that's where it's at
[1:29:48] and there was a reason for it that we
[1:29:52] should be saved from our enemies and
[1:29:54] from the hand of all that hate us there
[1:29:59] are reasons for the prophetic ministry
[1:30:03] to perform the mercy promised to our
[1:30:06] fathers and to remember his holy
[1:30:08] Covenant
[1:30:09] that wasn't always the reason there was
[1:30:14] a time when the reason was so she could
[1:30:16] take vengeance an eye for an eye in a
[1:30:20] tooth for a tooth
[1:30:21] oh but we received a new covenant oh the
[1:30:30] love of God that come down that day yes
[1:30:35] that entered his temple into a little
[1:30:39] body they thought when he was born he
[1:30:44] was just another little Jewish boy but
[1:30:48] it was God the Prophet said Mary was
[1:30:55] just an incubator that neither the man
[1:31:02] had anything to do with this birth or
[1:31:05] the woman Mary I say that this little
[1:31:11] body formed in Mary's womb wasn't even
[1:31:15] connected by an umbilical cord to Mary
[1:31:18] no connection I'm saying
[1:31:30] I told my wife happening she said you're
[1:31:36] losing it boy that's impossible
[1:31:40] well she loves me tremendously I love
[1:31:44] her and I said we'll think about how the
[1:31:49] seed got placed there and now ask
[1:31:52] yourself is it impossible spoken into
[1:31:57] existence a seed totally Dermot eyes
[1:32:04] both sperm and egg out of the womb out
[1:32:09] of this what we call oxygen and air come
[1:32:14] from the mind of God through a spoken
[1:32:16] word and placed in a little girl of Mary
[1:32:24] he wasn't Jew he wasn't Gentile he was
[1:32:29] the Lamb of God without spot he couldn't
[1:32:34] be attached in any way to this human
[1:32:36] race but he had to be a man to be a
[1:32:39] kinsman but he had to be born without
[1:32:41] spot without wrinkle for he would give
[1:32:45] his life a ransom for you and me and the
[1:32:48] great thing is God would accept the
[1:32:50] price he paid a price he paid for you
[1:33:10] when I was yet a far-off like the
[1:33:13] prodigal son he saw me and he loved me
[1:33:19] how far drunk
[1:33:22] drugs jail far off in the miry clay and
[1:33:34] there he loved you because he looked
[1:33:39] beyond this flesh body
[1:33:41] he looked beyond this sinful nature and
[1:33:46] he saw down inside a seat a spoken-word
[1:33:54] seat could it be anything less could you
[1:33:58] be anything less than him a spoken word
[1:34:02] see that to the revealed word and a
[1:34:07] character-building process you'll come
[1:34:10] forth as gold you'll come to the beat of
[1:34:13] stature of a perfect man Jesus Christ
[1:34:21] that we should be saved from our enemies
[1:34:24] by this new prophetic ministry and from
[1:34:29] the hand of all that hate us to perform
[1:34:32] the mercy promised to our fathers to
[1:34:34] remember his holy Covenant the oath
[1:34:37] which he sware to our father Abraham so
[1:34:40] a prophet must introduce Messiah where
[1:34:44] was God's provided way and through a
[1:34:46] mist God affirms the purpose of the
[1:34:48] prophetic ministry first we know by
[1:34:51] scripture prophets have been since the
[1:34:54] world began
[1:34:56] Genesis now in the middle of the book is
[1:34:59] called the Bible is a prophet called
[1:35:02] Amos and the name is 3/6 it says shall a
[1:35:06] trumpet be blown in the city and the
[1:35:09] people not be afraid shall there be
[1:35:11] people in the city and the LORD hath not
[1:35:13] done it surely the Lord God will do
[1:35:17] nothing but he reveal his his secrets to
[1:35:19] his servants the prophets the lion have
[1:35:22] roared
[1:35:23] who will not fear the Lord God had
[1:35:25] spoken who can but prophesy John the
[1:35:30] Baptist was that prophet that was to
[1:35:33] unfold loose reveal who is he that's a
[1:35:39] manual King of the Jews the Lion of the
[1:35:42] tribe of Judah the greatest secret ever
[1:35:44] revealed from the mind of God Christ the
[1:35:48] mystery of God revealed because it was
[1:35:51] Jesus of Nazareth the line of the tribe
[1:35:54] of Judah who would open the book and
[1:35:57] loose the seals
[1:36:00] that's the prophetic word in Revelations
[1:36:04] 5:5 so a fine gentleman told me for the
[1:36:13] Daniel who william branham did not open
[1:36:16] all the seals in 1963 i said you're
[1:36:21] absolutely right he goes like hello my
[1:36:28] talking to the same Daniel I said yeah
[1:36:30] yeah I'm listening I am a listener see
[1:36:37] he did not said that's correct absolute
[1:36:42] correct he did well I thought I've heard
[1:36:46] you preach you did again you're correct
[1:36:50] absolutely correct twice already
[1:36:54] that's what I like about you one more
[1:37:00] you're gonna hit it right out of the
[1:37:01] park I don't know but let me share this
[1:37:05] with you William Branham didn't open the
[1:37:08] seal 1963 because that happened over
[1:37:12] 2,000 years ago Jesus himself
[1:37:16] behold the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:37:19] will open the book and loose the seven
[1:37:23] seals around
[1:37:26] but he spoke at all in parables and what
[1:37:31] we receive in this in this 20 century
[1:37:34] problem the son of man with a son of man
[1:37:39] in his control is received the
[1:37:42] revelation upon disrupt I'll build my
[1:37:47] church I will give my church the
[1:37:50] revelation of things past things present
[1:37:54] things future but this book of
[1:38:00] revelations is all but almost a book of
[1:38:04] history and that prophecy it's a prophet
[1:38:10] saying there's little to come to pass
[1:38:12] he's waiting on you and he's waiting on
[1:38:16] me as Paul said until our obedience is
[1:38:21] complete think on that it's closing
[1:38:34] Isaiah 40 Isaiah 53 Malachi 3 Malachi 4
[1:38:43] it was a time of revealing the first
[1:38:47] coming of Christ it is a time of
[1:38:50] revealing again
[1:38:51] at the second coming living in the last
[1:38:56] few moments what God is doing or what he
[1:39:01] is doing is hinging on you and I
[1:39:12] are going out of here is it hinging on
[1:39:16] Israel she's in her over her redemption
[1:39:22] her receiving this son of men in the
[1:39:25] street and how soon is hinging on you
[1:39:30] and I this morning how long will we make
[1:39:34] those poor folks wait 144,000 how long
[1:39:38] will we make them wait till we get into
[1:39:40] the world and become the word Christ in
[1:39:45] us the hope of glory for if the mind
[1:39:48] that was in Christ being you it will
[1:39:51] quicken these mortal bodies took 167
[1:40:04] Amos six three six and seven a prophet
[1:40:09] let's introduce Messiah because it's
[1:40:11] God's weight and it must be more than a
[1:40:14] prophet because it's a time of
[1:40:16] restoration of both the fig tree and the
[1:40:19] bride tree prophets from the beginning
[1:40:23] Amos once again tells us the importance
[1:40:28] of the prophetic ministry blessed be the
[1:40:32] Lord God of Israel who had visited and
[1:40:34] redeemed his people and has raised up a
[1:40:37] tent horn of salvation for us in the
[1:40:39] house of his servant David as he spake
[1:40:43] by the mouth of his holy prophets which
[1:40:46] he have been since the world began
[1:40:52] God didn't change his mind about his
[1:40:55] word
[1:40:57] Luke 176 says and now child shall be
[1:41:04] called the prophet of the highest for
[1:41:07] thou shalt go be the four from the face
[1:41:09] of the Lord to prepare his ways to give
[1:41:11] knowledge of salvation unto his people
[1:41:13] by the remission of their sins through
[1:41:16] the tender mercy of our God were by the
[1:41:19] Dayspring from on high hath visited us
[1:41:22] to give light to them that sit in
[1:41:25] darkness in the shadow of death to guide
[1:41:28] our feet into the way of peace all this
[1:41:32] isn't an old scripture out of the New
[1:41:35] Testament this is thus saith the Lord
[1:41:37] even for you this mornin
[1:41:42] it says and the child grew and waxed
[1:41:45] strong in spirit and was in the desert
[1:41:47] till the day of his showing him to
[1:41:49] Israel John was the prophet a forerunner
[1:41:53] the only voice of God
[1:41:55] assuring a new age a new testament if
[1:41:58] you rejected John
[1:42:01] you probably reject it when you reject
[1:42:09] the prophetic ministry you reject all
[1:42:12] the benefits it's designed to give you
[1:42:17] Hebrews 7 11 hostile Paul if they're
[1:42:22] poor perfection or by the Levitical
[1:42:25] priesthood for under it the people
[1:42:27] receive the law what further need was
[1:42:30] there that another priest should rise
[1:42:32] after the order of Melchizedek and that
[1:42:34] be called after the order of Aaron no
[1:42:37] need no reason for the priesthood being
[1:42:41] changed there is made a necessity a
[1:42:45] change also the Lord also of the message
[1:42:49] has been given to the people that's why
[1:42:56] under a denomination you can never come
[1:43:03] to the fullness of the stature of a
[1:43:05] perfect man but they still have you
[1:43:09] under the law of creeds and dogmas and
[1:43:12] rituals you're bound up in a system
[1:43:17] a prison house as Israel was when Jesus
[1:43:24] come to Israel he said how often watch
[1:43:30] the imagery here how often have I as a
[1:43:38] hand tries to gather her brood and you
[1:43:43] would not
[1:43:49] so the here here's Jehovah hen in the
[1:43:59] chicken yard of organized religion
[1:44:05] declaring their status and he lowers
[1:44:11] himself to that image to open our eyes
[1:44:17] so we can ask our question where am I
[1:44:28] could I be an eagle in a henhouse and
[1:44:31] he's calling me up higher
[1:44:39] well the priesthood being changed there
[1:44:41] is made of necessity a change also the
[1:44:43] law so here whom these things are spoken
[1:44:46] pertaining to another tribe of which no
[1:44:50] man gave attendance at the altar for his
[1:44:52] evident that our Lord sprang out of
[1:44:54] Judah of which tribe Moses spoke nothing
[1:44:58] concerning priesthood and is yet far it
[1:45:05] did far more evident for that after the
[1:45:08] similitude of Melchizedek there arises
[1:45:10] another priest who has made done after
[1:45:13] the law of a carnal commandment but
[1:45:15] after the power of an endless life
[1:45:21] that's what we want to share with you
[1:45:27] not a carnal commandment but everlasting
[1:45:31] life for he testified thou art a priest
[1:45:36] forever after the order of Melchizedek
[1:45:39] for this merit for there is barely a
[1:45:42] dissing Ellen of the commandment matter
[1:45:46] of fact all ten of them thou shalt not
[1:45:51] kill ain't good enough for the bride of
[1:45:54] Jesus Christ anymore no do you say well
[1:46:02] what's wrong with that should not kill
[1:46:04] sounds pretty good to me not for you in
[1:46:11] whom dwells the Spirit of God in the
[1:46:15] seat of God he has called you to the
[1:46:19] next level it has been said by them of
[1:46:25] old thou shalt not kill he didn't say
[1:46:28] thus saith the Lord I told you back then
[1:46:30] no he said it has been said by them of
[1:46:34] all it's a proverb thou shalt not kill
[1:46:39] but I say unto you I the living word
[1:46:43] either manifested words either reveal
[1:46:46] words I the fountain
[1:46:48] of life there is a fountain in the house
[1:46:51] of David better stable this morning to
[1:46:55] you oh I sent you if you're angry
[1:47:05] against your brother without a cost bang
[1:47:10] you got him already you have heard it
[1:47:18] said by them of old doubt shall not
[1:47:22] commit adultery sounds like good advice
[1:47:28] but not for you not for me God's taking
[1:47:36] us asked the Bride of Christ his sons in
[1:47:40] his daughters those in whom lays the
[1:47:43] seed that was spoken a gene was in the
[1:47:52] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:47:54] world thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:47:59] it's to lowest standard for you to live
[1:48:02] a night too low too loose now he says if
[1:48:11] you even look upon a woman to lust after
[1:48:14] in your heart you have pull the trigger
[1:48:30] as my brother-in-law just to tell me
[1:48:32] from Austria Germany this ain't high
[1:48:36] school no more boy we're going to a
[1:48:40] higher level a songwriter said the
[1:48:47] refiners fire has now become my heart's
[1:48:52] desire and every time it pulls me in I
[1:48:58] don't know cuz it's burning everything
[1:49:04] that isn't him redemption is here
[1:49:12] salvation is here overcoming power is
[1:49:16] here some on my tape but the Daniel I'm
[1:49:27] sorry I can't do that guess what blessed
[1:49:36] are the poor in spirit that have given
[1:49:39] up and say I can't do that
[1:49:46] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:49:49] theirs is the kingdom of God and blessed
[1:49:56] are the poor in spirit who will give him
[1:49:59] full control all controlled all
[1:50:04] surrendered all let it go let God
[1:50:16] the revealed word Hebrew 719 for the law
[1:50:22] made nothing perfect but the bringing in
[1:50:26] of a better hope did by the which we
[1:50:32] draw nigh unto God the revealed word the
[1:50:36] open book preaching perfection a more
[1:50:39] excellent way this change in ministry
[1:50:43] and message Luke 16 and 16 along the
[1:50:50] prophets or until John since that time
[1:50:55] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[1:50:59] man presses into it
[1:51:00] John was a prophetic ministry under the
[1:51:05] order of Melchizedek a priesthood that
[1:51:09] spoke perfection and relationship
[1:51:12] restored when did he preach that when he
[1:51:17] stood on the banks of the Jordan and he
[1:51:20] told his people that were following him
[1:51:23] he baptizes Jesus washes the sacrifice
[1:51:27] and said behold the lamb of God that
[1:51:31] taketh away
[1:51:35] taken away your sins your doubts your
[1:51:39] sickness a priesthood that's both
[1:51:46] perfection relationship and storm
[1:51:50] tutorship begins mentorship begins under
[1:51:54] this ministry fellowship begins you're a
[1:51:57] son and a daughter in a process of
[1:51:59] adoption going unto perfection a body

[1:52:12] he was thrown off a ship because he was
[1:52:15] headed the wrong direction God has a way
[1:52:19] of turning us around but he wasn't the
[1:52:24] first Adam was the first to be thrown
[1:52:27] out of a ship and more than one Adam
[1:52:33] lost his fellowship Adam lost his
[1:52:37] rulership Adam lost his mentorship Adam
[1:52:41] was tossed off the old ship of Zion with
[1:52:45] no hope to return and yet he was a son
[1:52:50] being adopted he was a spoken word son

[1:53:00] and placed in a body of flesh he was a
[1:53:06] man on the seventh day being tutored by
[1:53:10] the father himself he was a man that had

[1:53:57] that statement please

[1:54:05] have I told you that Adam just spoke a
[1:54:08] few squirrels into existence would that
[1:54:11] help Adam lost his fellowship fell from
[1:54:25] the highest fellowship a man could have
[1:54:29] with God felt from a time that God was
[1:54:34] teaching him how to handle the spoken
[1:54:37] word be a creator speak worlds into
[1:54:42] existence a principle in the Bible no
[1:54:47] matter how high we think we've gone

[1:56:08] a constant unbroken fellowship by a
[1:56:11] grace of God the law and the prophets
[1:56:14] were until John and John was the new
[1:56:17] order the first amongst many to come
[1:56:20] that would be known as the fifl Ministry
[1:56:23] of Jesus Christ
[1:56:25] no more under the law a new prophetic
[1:56:29] ministry the fivefold ministry was the
[1:56:33] Ministry of Jesus Christ Paul did not
[1:56:38] invent it all didn't see it as a good
[1:56:42] way to keep the church in order had
[1:56:44] nothing to do with all it had to do with
[1:56:47] the revelation that Paul caught of the
[1:56:50] Ministry of Jesus Christ in Matthew 4 12
[1:56:54] to 25 Jesus is the itinerant Atlanta
[1:56:58] evangelist with a healing ministry brain
[1:57:01] for the sake in acts 3 22 to 26 Peter
[1:57:06] said by the mouth for the prophet Moses
[1:57:09] God has given to us the LORD thy God
[1:57:12] shall raise up a prophet like and done
[1:57:14] to me Jesus the prophet in Hebrews three
[1:57:22] one two three Apostle Paul says the
[1:57:26] chief apostle Jesus Christ
[1:57:31] Evangelos profit apostille in Saint John
[1:57:35] three Jesus goes to a man called
[1:57:38] Nicodemus and Nicodemus under that
[1:57:42] anointing tells me we know that thou art
[1:57:47] a teacher come from God
[1:57:53] teacher apostille prophet evangelist
[1:57:59] Peter in 1st Peter 5 winter for he said
[1:58:03] Jesus Christ the chief Shepherd of the
[1:58:07] flock
[1:58:14] and to use a religious explanation of
[1:58:17] joy bingo there it is
[1:58:19] the FIFO ministy in Jesus Christ that's
[1:58:24] where I come from that's what he gave
[1:58:26] those are the gifts what do you set that
[1:58:29] on high that he gave unto us here once
[1:58:32] again for the perfection for the Saints
[1:58:37] to help this body of Christ to give
[1:58:41] their lives a willing sacrifice to be
[1:58:45] servants to the people Hebrews 7 11 if
[1:58:58] therefore perfection were by the
[1:59:00] Levitical priesthood for under the
[1:59:03] people received the law what further
[1:59:05] need was there that another priest
[1:59:06] should arise in the order after the
[1:59:09] order of Melchizedek and not be called
[1:59:11] after the order of Aaron
[1:59:13] well the priesthood being changed there
[1:59:16] is made of necessity a change also of
[1:59:19] the law what was the change a new order
[1:59:24] a new priesthood no more prophets under
[1:59:28] the law for the law and the prophets or
[1:59:32] until John but now a new order of
[1:59:34] prophets a new order apostle's a new
[1:59:37] order of pastors and teachers and
[1:59:39] evangelists and they must have the Holy
[1:59:42] Ghost or they don't qualify to be part
[1:59:44] of this Melchizedek ministry for if not
[1:59:48] they'll never preach perfection and
[1:59:52] place it at the reach of every son and
[1:59:56] daughter of God worked for a fine man he
[2:00:00] belongs to church called Church of the
[2:00:04] valley or something to some mega church
[2:00:06] thousands of members worked in his home
[2:00:10] and got to talk to him about the Word of
[2:00:13] God he says Dan I sense you lean towards
[2:00:20] a Calvinist side just a little bit
[2:00:22] I told them I sense you're correct I
[2:00:26] said that's correct yeah that perfection
[2:00:33] such as its it doesn't mean perfection
[2:00:36] she's we can never be perfect
[2:00:38] I said Burt you're absolutely right but
[2:00:44] through Jesus Christ we can be none of
[2:00:48] ourselves not perfection as an a master
[2:00:52] mechanic that feels he knows all not
[2:00:55] perfection as some artisan carpenter not
[2:00:59] perfection in any of those ways no this
[2:01:04] is different
[2:01:04] this is sons and daughters to being
[2:01:07] adopted to a character building process
[2:01:12] and the perfection is a consummation of
[2:01:16] rapturing faith and a body change that's
[2:01:20] the perfection
[2:01:29] the FIFO ministry must place the
[2:01:31] promises have to reach the people we
[2:01:34] must place modesty holiness at the reach
[2:01:38] of our sons and daughters we must place
[2:01:40] fidelity at the reach of our married
[2:01:42] couples we must place forgiveness at
[2:01:46] those were torn by sin a new ministry
[2:01:51] with no law but love no Creed but Christ
[2:01:55] no book but the Bible Matthew 23 Jesus
[2:02:01] speaking he says woe unto you scribes
[2:02:04] and Pharisees and hypocrites because you
[2:02:07] build the tombs of the prophets and
[2:02:09] garnish the cellars of the righteous and
[2:02:13] they say if we had been in the days of
[2:02:16] our Father we had not been partakers
[2:02:18] with them in the blood of the prophets
[2:02:21] wherefore you be witnesses unto
[2:02:24] yourselves that you're the children of
[2:02:26] them which killed the prophets and today
[2:02:30] you witness to people and say I believe
[2:02:33] in the prophets Isaiah and Amos all that
[2:02:37] but the law and the prophets were till
[2:02:40] John they say see no more what in the
[2:02:47] world do we tell them that we know
[2:02:51] prophets were since the beginning the
[2:02:54] scripture tells us who know prophets
[2:02:57] continued throughout half the Bible Amos
[2:03:00] tells us of vindicates till the
[2:03:03] prophetic ministry
[2:03:10] Jesus speaking to the scribes and
[2:03:13] Pharisees he says in Matthew 23:33
[2:03:17] he serpents ye generation of vipers how
[2:03:21] can you escape the damnation of Hell he
[2:03:26] brings into this statement the parable
[2:03:28] of serpent seed and then in verse 34
[2:03:32] Jesus long after John has been beheaded
[2:03:36] long after John is off the scene Jesus
[2:03:40] says this to them wherefore behold I
[2:03:43] send unto you prophets long after John
[2:03:49] is gone and wise men and scribes and
[2:03:56] some of them you shall kill and crucify
[2:03:57] some of them you shall scourge in your
[2:03:59] synagogues and persecute them from city
[2:04:02] to city but nonetheless I'm establishing
[2:04:06] in this New Testament church I'm
[2:04:08] establishing from this day on then I'm
[2:04:13] unchanging in all my ways why I
[2:04:15] established in Genesis well I said Amos
[2:04:18] to sake now I say it myself in this body
[2:04:23] of Jesus of Nazareth I will continue to
[2:04:26] send you a prophetic ministry I will
[2:04:29] have a fivefold ministry for the
[2:04:31] perfecting of the church but I alone
[2:04:37] will bring you revelation through this
[2:04:41] ministry that no man might glory but
[2:04:45] then all the glory should be to Jesus
[2:04:52] the musicians come forward this morning
[2:05:00] jesus said behold I send into profits
[2:05:04] long after John had been killed Jesus
[2:05:08] ascending on your ministry now there was
[2:05:12] preach perfection jesus said in Matthew
[2:05:16] 5:48 be he therefore perfect even as
[2:05:21] your father which is in heaven is
[2:05:24] perfect so what was the first 47 verses
[2:05:28] of Matthew 5:48 about the attributes and
[2:05:32] characteristics of your perfection in
[2:05:34] mind we're going back to Eden

[2:17:38] don't be scared because Jesus is one of
[2:17:43] the best swimmers ever you know one of
[2:17:52] evils are training their little eaglets
[2:17:54] they we're told by science and men who
[2:17:57] study them they'll take those little
[2:18:00] eaglets on their wings and they'll fly
[2:18:03] the heavens with them and they'll take
[2:18:05] them back to the nest they'll get him
[2:18:09] again jump on kids that mother Eagle
[2:18:12] flies out there was little Eagles
[2:18:15] holding on she's letting the winds of
[2:18:18] the Holy Spirit move her and her
[2:18:20] children hanging on but one day she says
[2:18:24] it's child rearing time these kids got
[2:18:28] to learn how to fly for themselves
[2:18:30] they'll say that Mama Eagle will drop
[2:18:32] her wings and shoot like a rocket bring
[2:18:36] straight to the Sun then the legals
[2:18:39] can't hold on they can't hold on they're
[2:18:43] shaking baba straight now slow down and
[2:18:49] they lose their grip and they go
[2:18:52] tumbling they go tumbling to the air
[2:18:56] they've never stretched their wings to
[2:18:57] the winds of the Holy Ghost before
[2:19:00] they're tumbling they can't get their
[2:19:03] balance in the air my mother just
[2:19:06] watches it
[2:19:07] we're told that at a certain point
[2:19:10] mother will swoop down looking from
[2:19:14] above watching tumblers
[2:19:16] stretch out her wings and catch them and
[2:19:18] pick them up you see as they looked up
[2:19:25] to ARMA and saw that distance getting
[2:19:28] greater and the Earth's distance getting
[2:19:30] shorter at some point they think it's
[2:19:34] too late she's waited too long but what
[2:19:39] they don't know is it is that mama Eagle
[2:19:43] can fly faster than the babies can fall
[2:19:47] God can come down quicker than the
[2:19:50] prodigal son can get himself into
[2:19:52] trouble he's done time and time again to
[2:19:57] [Music]
[2:20:05] be here or danger to be here before the
[2:20:10] foundation of the world
[2:20:14] he's stretching out his wing let me take
[2:20:21] you where man has never gone before
[2:20:25] let me take you into my presence let me
[2:20:29] take you into my loved God Richard mercy
[2:20:39] rich Anderson but one day that mom will
[2:20:45] take those illegals for the last time
[2:20:51] and maybe one of them will stretch his
[2:20:53] wings and begin to fly mama's watching
[2:20:59] and the other one keeps tumbling
[2:21:04] tumbling there's been witnesses that
[2:21:07] have said they've watched it and they've
[2:21:09] watched that little Eagle hit the ground
[2:21:12] she didn't swoop down to get him again
[2:21:15] he wouldn't stretch forth his wings
[2:21:20] [Music]
[2:21:22] borne an eagle and that is the history
[2:21:39] of the grace of God never died if you're
[2:21:45] a son and daughter of God if you're his
[2:21:48] child and you won't come and be
[2:21:53] corrected he'll take you home
[2:22:03] is the sovereign grace of God beyond our
[2:22:08] understanding as human beings where
[2:22:13] couldn't he lived another day another
[2:22:14] week another year wouldn't we hurt her

[2:22:32] understand it but I believe it and if we
[2:22:39] can believe all things are possible

[2:27:35] Lord but thank you so grateful for the
[2:27:54] things there were a lot of things that

[2:28:42] one thing that he was always pray that
[2:28:46] God give us grace that our house will

[2:29:44] that is they're giving us a lot of
[2:29:47] assets to be able to embrace our promise
[2:29:51] so if we are struggling on both hand
