TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] call me up brother I said I got time right now because I want to be straight and we lay aside everything else to do it if you come up he said brother Branham you teach that there is just one God I said yes sir he said well he said I believe there's one God but one God in three persons I said sir repeat that again he said one God and three persons I said where did you go to school at and he told me a Bible College I said I could believe that you cannot be a person without being a personality and if your personality you are a one personality to yourself you're a separate individual being and he said well the theologians can't even explain that I said it's by revelation and he said I can't accept Revelation I said then there's no way for God to ever get to you because it's hid from the eyes of wise and prudent and revealed to babes revealed Revelation revealed to babes such as will accept it and learned now I said there'd be no way for God to get to you you close yourself off from him the whole Bible is a revelation of God the whole church is built upon the revelation of God there's no other way to know God Only by revelation to whom the son will reveal him Revelation everything is revelation so to ex not to accept the Revelation then you're just a cold Theologian and there's the hope for you now how we find out that this person had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life it was God in Martin now the world the word comes the Greek word means change was used changing himself and morphed from one person to one person the Greek word there in marpa means it was taken from the stage act that one person is changing his mask to make him some other character like in in school just recently I believe um Rebecca just before she graduated they had won a Shakespeare's play and one young man had to change his clothes several times because he played two or three different parts but the same person he come out one time he was the villain and when he came out next time he was another character and now the Greek word in Martha mean that he changed his mask and that's what God did it's the same God all the time God in the form of the Father the the spirit the pillar of Fire the same God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in Martha brought out so he could be seen and now that same God is a Holy Ghost father son holy not three Gods three offices three Acts of the one God the Bible said there is one God not three but that's how that they could you can't get this straightened out and had three gods you never sell a Jew that I'll tell you that one who knows better he knows there's only one god notice like the sculpture he hides but the amassed over it that's what God's done to this age it's been hid all these things has been hidden and supposed to be revealed in this age now the Bible says they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculpture keeping his his piece of work all covered over until the time it takes the mask off of it and there it is and that's what the Bible has been it has been a work of God that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and it's Sevenfold mystery and God promised in this day at the age of this lady of sea church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing God in Marvin mask in a pillar of Fire God in marbed in a man called Jesus in his church God above us God With Us God in us the condensing of God up there holy no one could touch him he settled up on the mountain and even if an animal touched the mountain had to die and then God come down and changed his tent and come down and live with us become one of us and we held him the Bible said first Timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of God it's for God was manifested in the flesh handled the hands God eat me God drink water God slept God cried he was one of us beautiful types in the Bible that was God above us God With Us now it's God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person the same person God came down and become flesh and died to death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship God loves Fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time far was for Fellowship God dwelt Alone the cherubins and notice now he made man and man fell so he came down and redeemed man because God loves to be worshiped the word god means object of worship and this that comes Among Us as a pillar of fire as something it changes our hearts that is the same God that says let there be light and there was light he's the same yesterday today and forever now in the beginning God dwelt Alone with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what he thinks is he's going to to build create he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it in a different form because God's the only way only one can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then and uh a word is a thought when it's expressed it's a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's God's attributes then it becomes uh thought in a word notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him and his thinking before there ever was an angel star cherubin or anything else that's eternal and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here but the shape and form that the infinite God and if he isn't infinite he isn't God God has to be infinite we're finite he's infinite and he was omnipresent omnip Mission and omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be God knows all things all places because of his omnipresent omnit Vision makes him omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind he is a being he dwells in a house but being omnit Mission knowing all things makes him omnipresent because he knows everything is going on there can't be a flee bat its eyes but what he noted and he noted before there was the world how many times it bad its eyes and how much talent had in it before there ever was a world that is infinite if we can't comprehend it in our minds but that's God God infinite and remember you your eyes your statue whatever you was you were in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing that you are is expression word I actually thought it he spoke it and here you are amen amen if it isn't if you wasn't in his thinking there's no way at all for you ever be there or he is the one who gives eternal life do you remember how we read the scriptures not him that willeth or him that rise but God and that is predestination might stand true he could choose before any time who Bob's Sovereign in his choosing did you know that God's sovereign who was baptized or tell him a better way to make the world who would dare you tell him he's running his business wrong even the very the very word itself very Sovereign even the Revelation is sovereign he reveals to whom he will reveal the very Revelation itself is Sovereign God that's how people pounding things and jumping things and hidden things that not knowing what they're doing God is Sovereign in his works now we find him at the beginning is attribute so now you were with him there then is when the Book of Life comes into view now we read over here in Revelations the 13th chapter the eighth first that the Beast that comes upon the Earth in the United States will deceive all those people on the Earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world think of it before Jesus was ever born 4 000 years before he came on Earth and several thousand years before you come on Earth Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of the world and the Book of Life was made and your name was put on that book of life for the foundation of the world that's the Bible truth see your knee was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world you were there in his attributes you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life you are a part of God when you become a son or a daughter of God just as you are a part of your Earthly father that's right you are the male carers the hemoglobin the blood I'm on that has gone in in the egg then you become a part of your father and your mother is a part of your father also so you're all a part of your father Glory that that's the denomination not all together amen [Music] certainly does God and all the only place notice down his attribute then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwell Among Us Saint John the first chapter in the first verse notice this is in the beginning but before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time begins it was worth but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was stressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting where Melchizedek is that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen amen and then the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us hold that there now notice his his first being was spirit God Supernatural all right the great eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body this then is the state he was in when he met Abraham was called melchizede he was in the form of theophany I will get you that and prove it in a few minutes the Lord willing he was the word a theophany is something that you could not see it could be right here now yet you cannot see it it's just like well like television that's in another dimension television people are moving right through this room now singing there's colors also but the eye is only subject to the five senses your whole being is only subject to Five Senses rather and you are only subject to what the sight has been limited to see but there is another dimension that can be seen by a transformation but television now television does not manufacture a picture a television only channels that end to a circuit and then the television screen picks it up but the pictures there to begin with television was you when Adam was here television was shared when Elijah said on Mount Carmel television was here when Jesus of Nazareth walked the shores of Galilee but you're just now discovering it they wouldn't have believed it back there you'd have been crazy to have said something like it but now it's become a reality and so is it that Christ is here the angels of God are here and someday in the great Millennium to come it'll be just more real in television or anything else because they are here reveals himself in his great form of body claim as the amorphous himself into his servants and it proves himself now here he is in the form of spirit and then he comes in the form of uh in morphod I appeared to Abraham in Martha when Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the Kings here come Melchizedek talk to him the other day in the Tucson paper I was reading an article that where there was a a woman driving down the road I believe about 40 50 miles an hour and she hit an old man with an Overcoat on she screamed and stopped her car threw him up in the air right out of the plain desert and she run back to find him and he wasn't there so what did she do some people behind her saw it happen saw the old man flap there in his Overcoat turning so they run back to find out they couldn't find the man anywhere they called the police force the police come out to examine the place there's nobody there well each one of them testified the car choked hit the man he went up in the air and everybody saw it Witnesses and two or three carloads of them they seen it happen come to find out five years ago there was an old man with an Overcoat on hit and killed on the same spot when you leave here you're not dead you've got to come back even if you're a sinner and be judged according to the Deeds down the body if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one waiting in Marvin that's the word now God in this stage of it's the stage of his creation later farmed into flesh Jesus from what from the great beginning Spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it just spoke out in Marvin later he becomes flesh Jesus mortal to taste death for all us sinners when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing but I want to watch how we have to come also we see him revealed here in Ruth and and Boaz as a Kinsmen Redeemer how he had to come to be flesh now we see the attributes sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body but a theophany this body is subject to the word and Earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word an inmorphed body he came in and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek then later we never heard no more Melchizedek because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we just become the flesh man not the word but and look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was the thought at the beginning that proves a predestination of God you can't be the word unless you're a thought he had been a thinking first but to see an artist and Temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here and flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me and I'll raise him up at the last days see you had to be first and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute to before the foundation World his name's put on the Lamb's Book of Life then from that he become the word it's theophany that could appear disappear and then he become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of it it throws this body in subjection to God Hallelujah he that's born of God does not commit sin amen cannot sin Romans 8 1. there is therefore now not condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk up ask the flesh from answer the spirit amen there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drink to the Box just get in Christ it's all gone yeah see because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead their sins are buried and baptism and you are a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of life like you winning claiming you got Holy Ghost and going out of here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be sown certainly it can't be he's not a filthy Spirit he's the Holy Spirit amen and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word may manifest or quickened Hallelujah and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it no question and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection amen this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and admire and crushing but now it's got the earnest has turned heaven thank you Lord now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture it's an Earnest a sick person laying down nothing left but death that's all can happen I've seen a Shadows of people don't eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there is no Divine Healing then there's no Resurrection those Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection amen you at the earnest money is don't you it's a down payment he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we're healed notice how wonderful we loving now this body is subject to the spirit have not yet entered into the word form but we are still in the flesh form but subject to the word Death In the Flesh will take us there just the same thing think of a little baby you can take a woman no matter how evil she is when she is pregnant and fixing to be mother watch before that baby's born I don't care how cruel a woman is she gets real kind there's something about our silence seems Godly to see a little mother fix and become Mother by the baby why is it that little body now it's not alive yet see the only thing it is it's just flesh and muscles that little jumping that's this muscles jerking but when it comes forth from the womb God breathes the breath of life into it and then he screams out see Justice assured as there is a natural body be formed there is a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets here [Music] oh [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
