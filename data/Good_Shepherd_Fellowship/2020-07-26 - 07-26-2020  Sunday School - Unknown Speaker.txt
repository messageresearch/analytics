greetings to all that's here tonight i'm sorry that we're still jammed and packed till we can hardly breathe even the air conditioners as well as this air conditioner doesn't have much effect so many

waiting for the coming of the lord and now many of you maybe wasn't at the services this morning but i trust that everyone that wasn't will get that tape or i believe that it was the most straightest message to the church since that the message of sirs what time is it i felt the anointing of the spirit felt led to say what i did it was long but yet i felt led to do it i think the lord by his word showed that what our we're living and make sure that we understand these mysterious things that's happening you know the bible said the wise shall understand but the nations and the people will go weaker and wiser just think the average america now is in middle age about 20 years old weaker but wiser they didn't have jet planes in them days and and atomic warheads but they live a lot longer we're getting weaker and wiser and our own wisdom is what's going to destroy us we will destroy ourselves god will not destroy us our wisdom will destroy us it's always been that way and so will it be again now the lord willing next sunday morning not knowing now what i will speak on but i trust that the lord if he lets us live and nothing happens that be his will we aim to speak another message next sunday morning have prayer for the sick next sunday night then it falls my lot to return back home to arizona to take the family back so that the children can register in school then you will notify you just as we can of the meetings as they mature or the times that we are places that we aim to be so god bless you all now tonight knowing that it's i'm 15 minutes late to begin with quarter till eight here in jeffersonville and um that's about a quarter of the nine at the east coast and then it's about five o'clock on the west coast so now we are just about sun down here and i want to speak to you for just a short service to try to find the anointing of the spirit and then call the prayer line now i want the congregation here as well as the congregation assembled at other places find some man some brother that's anointed by the spirit and when we start praying for the sick go lay hands upon those that's in your congregation remember god is omnipresent he's everywhere so down in texas over in california up in arizona wherever you are lay hands on those that are sick when we start praying for the sake and i'm sure god will hear and answer prayer strange thing last sunday night and the anointing was going on in the holy spirit it's quiet a thing i hadn't had a a line of discernment for months and months since i was here the other time then to walk up there under a promise you don't know that he'll do it you can't say he'll do it you just got to walk up there and wait he's sovereign he does what he wants to but stand there and wait to see what he will do then feel it break through like that and at the end of the meeting not knowing who it was but there'd been a a man somewhere along the line that was tall bald on top and he was a very sick person then right at last there was a man appeared here on the platform and had his head down and looked like he was suffering holding himself around the stomach and i thought that must be that first man or second man or whatever it was at a prey point because he was bald and was holding his head down a large man stooped over but i looked around and i found the gentleman sitting out there but he was rejoicing i thought where is it i couldn't decide where it was at i could feel it and see the man before me i felt it pulled around this way and it was coming from bank i looked at brother neville and these two sitting here it wasn't them i said the man is on the inside of that babs tree back there you know who it was brother shepard reason i couldn't recognize him he's sitting back there with his head bound praying he thought he was going to die has thought that for the last few weeks his wife told him go get a new pair of shoes and he said i won't need them i won't be here that long and he met me the other day and up there in the yard brother woods is shouting and praising god said i'm eating bacon eggs tomatoes anything i want and humbly giving up his seat getting back in there out of the way and praying see you don't need a prayer card you only need faith see i didn't know whether he was healed or not i just said a man praying has got something wrong i think he called what it was stomach trouble and praying back behind here the lord jesus make you well now that's all i could tell the pull was that he was praying i could see it but what happens i don't know see but when you see it come back everybody's aware when it says thus saith the lord see that's not me speaking no more than that's him but i always say jesus christ has made you whole that's exactly the truth he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed see but when it comes thus saith the lord and tells you what to do and what's going to happen watch that it'll be that way but when i say jesus christ healed you makes you whole you believe it because he's already said it i'm just repeating what he said in a vision is just repeating what he showed you understand now may we hurry up get right into the word because i know that many of you are here got long miles to travel tonight i pray that god will bless you help you and protect you along the roads and now i wish to turn tonight to saint matthew the 21st chapter and verses 1 to 11 in saint matthew and now if you don't have your bible or you want to jot down these scriptures all right now to you who never heard the message this morning and you have a tape recorder we never solicit selling tapes we never solicit selling anything sometimes in a big meeting the announcer got some books back there we don't make anything out of them brother dale's a writer the tapes the man operates the tape business there will tell you we don't make no tape money we don't paint the tapes it's the message and when a man gets on his mind that it's money he ain't gonna make tapes no more that's right i asked it about it i think our tape sell about under five dollars or something three to five or something like that why say three and four for them big long tapes and a certain minister i asked about one of his tapes and it was nine dollars about 20 minutes or 30 of a message so i see that our brother sophomore backyard is not getting rich any of them on these tapes that they're they're putting out see they make this enough to get by can't ask them to make them for nothing because they have to buy the tapes and everything else and the machinery is very expensive costs about ten thousand dollars gets set up to make those tapes to begin with now i understand soon i have announced it yet but there's a tape hearing again every so often we the trustees i have nothing to do with it at all i don't even know it none of the meetings it's another pro or con they turn in their bids the trustees decide who is the next man to make tapes and they send him a letter that's all i know about it they take care of that because i can't even dedicate babies let alone take care of tapes so are baptized so i've got my mind set on this message that's that third pull it's the one i must be loyal and reverent to matthew 21 1-11 i said that so he could be watching for the are turning to the scriptures and when the and when they drew now onto jerusalem and were come to bethany onto the mount of olives jesus sent two of his disciples and saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway you shall find an ass tied and a coat with her loose them and bring them to me and if any man say ought unto you you shall say the lord has needed them and straightway he will send them this was all done that it might be fulfilled which is spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughters of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek setting upon an ass and uh hold the fold of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and they brought the ass and the coat and put on them their clothes and they set him there on and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way and others cut out branches from the trees and strew them in the way and the multitude that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee now if i would take a text from that for about 30 minutes before the prayer line begins i would like to take this for a text what is the attraction on the mountain now it had been a very weary nervous day and it's an unusual day we find jesus here coming up to jerusalem ready to attend the passover and the passovers were the paschal lamb was killed and the blood was spread upon the mercy seat for the the atonement for of for the people and he come up from bethage and had come to the top of the mount of olives which looks down upon another little hill where jerusalem was built as he looked to know that this was his final visit this was the time that when he would be delivered into the hands of sinful man and they would kill him he'd die the harmless death that was ever died by a mortal and be buried he'd be betrayed by his own some of them standing right with him and him being god knew what was in their hearts and knew from the beginning who would betray and know that man was with him who sat by his side counted his money to him and so forth know that man would betray and knew that a cruel roman cross waited for him out there he knew that his water and his body and the blood of his body would separate and the blood would drop off of his forehead great big drops like perspiration he knew all that was before him and he stands upon the mountain looking over to jerusalem the people of that day the what they call that day a better religious class of people hated him the churches of that day hated him and denounced him and denounced all that listened to him as they went and attended his campaigns they were immediately excommunicated from the fellowship of the church no wonder the scripture said he came unto his own and his own received him not the ones who ought to have loved him the ones who ought to be in for him was his bitter bitterest enemies and he had made up his little group out of a bunch of poor people fishermen tax getters uneducated the bible said some of them was even ignorant unlearned some could not even sign their name he never went to the churches to get his people and he never agreed with any of the church leaders and besides that he followed the very trend of a prophet he condemned everything that they done as the ones before him had because they were a portion of the word and he was the word in its fullness but in the midst of all of it through every age and every prophet that had been or would be there's going to be a certain amount of people that's predestinated to hear that message and they'll follow it those ignore the crowds they ignore the criticism of the unbeliever they they have no argument with them they've got one thing to do that's believe and to get every bit of it they can soak it in like mary who sat at the feet of jesus and martha was fixing his dinner and jesus said to her but martha you are so concerned about the things of life but mary has sought the better things see the things of eternal life now we find that many of the people that i'd understood they didn't have uh literature as we have today they didn't have television or telephones or anything of that day but it been kindly breezed around that he was going to be at the passover for many of the people being spiritual minded knew that he was that passover lamb because it already told him the things that was going to happen and then of course knowing that he was to be there and loved him the way they did they was waiting for him there was a crowd that was probably pushing shoving from one gate to the other watching out in every way for they knew that one of the hours he would appear they were watching others were wondering what was the matter of these people running from gate to gate what's the attraction and they would look this way and look that way to find out look like they were looking for something under expectation of something going to happen oh how i would like to change my text for a few minutes and say this that that's what's the matter today the people who are looking for him coming is under great anticipation and expectations we can feel it the pressure and they're seeking watching every move and every sign comparing it with the scriptures and when they seen all those things that was predicted of him right up to the end they know the end was nigh they wanted to be there so they watched part of the crowds was foreign in the minority some was against him most of them 90 was against him and that's about the way it is today in the religious crowds when it really come down to the word and christ there's about one percent that would believe it the other part wouldn't pay attention to it no matter what was done they'd pass off some kind of a joke or throw a slam about it just about the same time things don't change very much history just repeats itself around well we find that draw a nervous tension it had to it must do it they were waiting they were wondering what he would do when he got there they wanted to be there to get anything that he'd done they wanted it they wanted to see it they believed him others that heard he was coming and they went up there to make fun of him so after all the nervous anticipation a very unusual day very unusual time church is asleep the people's nerve was on age there were so many people there then it happened on top of mount olive come a little white donkey coming walking down the hill with a group of people fanatically screaming pulling off palms leaves off the trees throwing their clothes in the road screaming hosanna to the son of david that comes in the name of the lord that this little mew his writer was none other than god's anointed messiah of the hour god then what was he doing what is that attraction up there on the hill it's god making history and god fulfilling prophecy and that always causes an attraction it brings all the critics up the vultures of this morning's message and the eagles also see they come together to find out what's going on some coming for curiosity some coming to find fault others coming to criticize there's all kinds gathered as we said this morning believers make believers and unbelievers what's on the mountain prophecy is being fulfilled now we'll see what takes place now in the book of zachariah in the ninth chapter and the ninth verse zechariah one of the prophets spoke in the spirit saying this rejoice greatly old daughters of zion shout o daughters of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass upon the full occult the fold of an ass now what was the matter with those scribes what was the matter with those priests what was remattered with those religious people this was wrote 487 years before it happened by vindicated prophet and was already put into writings and called the bible the scrolls of the old testament why couldn't they see that that's prophecy being fulfilled the same reason they can't see it today they took the word of god and made it of non-effect to the people by teaching for traditions for doctrine the traditions of man and of scribes preachers ministers spiritual man so-called anointed ones would only read the bible they wouldn't be wondering what's taking place they would know what it is god fulfilling his word history was being made prophecy was being fulfilled salvation to the world was arriving the great day that all the prophets had looked forward to all that was in the grave was waiting for that day think of it all that had died all the righteousness of the blood of the martyrs and the prophets which you just screamed out jerusalem oh jerusalem you the stone every prophet that i send to you and kill the righteous how often i have hovered you as a hindu would have brewed but you would not but now your hours come everything that was in the grave abraham isaac jacob all the prophets were waiting for this hour and the church was blind to it who is this caused all this noise who is that fellow that said one time is not that the carpenter's son over here we know him where did he get this wisdom while we don't seem connected with any of our schools we don't know any books he ever learned from who is it he was the answer of the prophet's prophecy here he comes rioting upon the fold of an ass what an attraction god was fulfilling his promised word the hour that had been waiting since 4 000 years and genesis the third chapter and the 15th verse [Music] you
