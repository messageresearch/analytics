TRANSCRIPT
========================================
She she died and it was coming Christmas time and the little wife being weakly, she she died. And it was coming Christmas time and the little girl she had developed from malnutrition, not having the right food and things. uh she took TV also and she's a little fella about eight nine years old 10 and she had never had a doll for Christmas and that's what she wanted for a gift was a doll and the father not able to give her medical attention and so forth and he he seen the little girl was going fast and he tried his best to to to get enough money together to get her a doll for Christmas if he could just get enough to buy her a little doll. And so the Christmas time was coming on, the bad weather set in. The little girl developed some kind of a pneumonia and and died just a few weeks before Christmas. And the father of course brokenhearted went to his little tin can and got the money out and he thought of his little girl and she wanted a doll like a little girl. See it's a little mother coming on. You notice how a little girl she goes to doll because she's that's her nature. She's a she's a coming mother. She will be mother someday she lives and everything nor nature. That's a little girl likes a little doll. she might take care of because after all she she's a little potentially a little mother and she wanted a little doll. She never had one. Daddy had saved everything he could to get her a little doll. And so she died and the father kind of had a lapse of mind. his wife had been taking this little girl in his mind kind of got to a place that he still he go to bed every night and talked to this little girl though she was been buried but he thought he he was talking to her and tell her now honey it won't be long and daddy's going to get you this dolly for Christmas and daddy's promised you the dolly and I I'm I'm going to get it finally Christmas arrive and of course you know how it is the rich had their their big parties and the candles burning and the great high masses in the churches and talking about Jesus and and so forth. The churches were going through all kind of routines of mass and singing and carols and everything. Little did they know what was going on back in the alley behind all this. this uh little fella back there and he got beside himself. He wanted that little girl to have that doll so bad cuz she had begged soul for this little doll. So he went out and he bought her a little rag doll, a little uh little thing probably about 30 cents, a little dirty something you bought down on the side of the street. And it was a real cold night. the the blizzard winds are blowing, snow falling hard there in New York out on the coast, the streets filling up and the people in their great big limousine cars and drunken parties out drinking the celebration of the birth of Christ and of these things that we speak of tonight trying to think that that's the right way to do it is to drink off their old sorrows and things and that's that's the way to do it. call them stand in the store the other day and the woman talked about what two girls met who won't know what they got for their daddy and one of them said well she got him a carton of certain kind of cigarettes and the other said she got him a fifth of whiskey and a and a and a deck of car that ain't giving a memorial gift for the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's way it goes you see it's just a big bunch of tinsel it hasn't got Christmas in it at all and so we find out this little man. He wandered along and he know his heart his little girl was gone, but he went and bought the doll anyhow. And he thought, "I'll just start walking. I'll find her somewhere. She'll be along the street here. I'll find her." And he started walking. He he couldn't fool himself. She wasn't back there in a little shanty and in the little ragged dirty bed, but uh she was buried. So he he knew he thought he'd find her on the street. He said, "I'll just keep walking." And he's going down through the alleys while they were singing their carols and going on and going down the alley packing this little dirty doll holded in his coat up to his heart, thinking of his little girl. And finally, a policeman happened to see him and policeman had a few drinks himself and he run into the alley and grabbed the old man and turned him around. He said, "What are you doing? I didn't hear him." He said, "I'm taking this little doll, sir, to my little girl." He said, "Where do you live?" And he told him where he lived. He said, "Well, you're going away from that place. You're drunk. Go back the other way." He said, "Sir, I'm not drunk. I promise my little girl I' I'd get her a gift for Christmas." And said, "An appropriate gift for a little girl is a little doll." And he said, "Let me see it." So he showed him a little dirty rag doll and he's holding in his next to his bosom holding a little doll as he. So the policeman half drunk himself shoved him on and started down. The old man went down the alley and snow falling past and well the midnight parties broke up. The next morning the snow lit up. The sun had come out. So they was all the people from their great gay parties. high sacks on their heads from too much drinking and celebration of the the birth of Christ and and many of them were forced and caring all from all the going on. But way down in the alley they found the old man and when he turned him over he had the little doll next to his heart. I suppose he tuck his gift to her. He found her in a land not here. &gt;&gt; Right. He he he tucked the gift. It was an appropriate gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God merciful. Yet it cost him his death. There's no other way in the world he could have given her the gift. She was burying him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the only way he could do it would be go like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Little doll. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't mean too much. I guess a little dirty doll, but it What did he do? It fulfilled a promise he had made. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what the people thought about it, his dirty hands and a little dirty doll, but it fulfilled a promise to his little girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they look upon the gospel, the same thing. They didn't want it when God brought it, but it fulfilled a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he would give his son. You know what? They left him to die, too. Just like a on the street. That's &gt;&gt; exactly right. They left him to die like a on the street. And today they treat him like a trap on the street. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he fulfilled what he was supposed to do. He was the gift that God promised to the world. &gt;&gt; Tonight I let me take him as my savior in my heart. &gt;&gt; Let me walk in the face of my death for whatever it is that I &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I promise my life to him. &gt;&gt; I want to take it to him. No matter where I have to go, if I go through death and I have to be shot, no matter what takes place, I have be laughed at called crazy, everything has to communicate, the rest of the Christians, churches and so forth. Uh it's a gift of God that I hold in my heart. &gt;&gt; I want to take it to our head just appropriate gifts I speak on. It was appropriate gift because the little girl she was a little girl to be little mother would have been an appropriate gift was a little an appropriate gift that God the creator could give to his creation would be a savior to save it from the condition it was in. I wonder tonight as we are approaching Christmas now and I suppose it be the last message we hear between now and Christmas unless we get to the radio messages somewhere. I wonder tonight if we've accepted the gift that God promised us, eternal life in believing on Christ and receiving the Holy Spirit. If you have and you'd like to accept God's real true Christmas gift, would you raise your hand? Say, "Brother Brandon, I I don't know. I I've sometimes believed it and I've watched what things I do and I'm kind of a little bit in doubt." Don't Don't doubt it anymore, friends. It It's too late to go to doubt now. Let's be real sure of it. Say, "Pray for me, Brother Brandham." And I want to God's gift to the world of Jesus Christ. I I want this to be a real Christmas. I accept the Holy Spirit in my heart that can cradle me through all the storms of life. And someday I can come in his presence with this gift of eternal life. He'll accept me upon those bases. That's the only way he'll do it. Or if you got the right gift tonight, the right kind of an attitude, God, I'll follow you wherever you go. Whatever you say, do, I'll do it. Whatever your word says to me, do it. I'll do it. Yes, sir. I don't care what everybody else says. I'm going to do it because I want your gift. It's life and Christ is the word. If you can't believe all the word and say, "Well, I don't know. I I believe it this, I believe that, but I just can't go this. I can't go that." You're like the 70 at 108. But you can accept all the word and receive Christ in the fullness of his deity and his service and ready to die as he did for you. Then would you just put up your hand with your head bow and say pray for me. God bless you and God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Yes. I see your hands. The Lord bless you. Sure. This little gift of Christ that God sent to the world and identified it by the magi identified it. His own life identified it. His death identified it. His resurrection identified it. Your accepting identified it. And he identifies himself with you that you are his and he is yours. If you're not really see that reaction of the spirit of God working in you this Christmas season, may it come to you now, heavenly father, as we stagger like the on the street. Nobody had any use for the world went right on and their foolish celebration are tonight. Lord, but sometimes we feel like we're trans, but we've accepted a gift. So we pray, Father, that you make us the gift of a life to this dying world. Many here have raised their hands that they want the gift of God that it he had himself give his only begotten son, came down, become a man. And he stooped so low they didn't even he come so low and so humble to it he it didn't even have a bed to be born in a a a cow had to or horse or something had to give its manger step aside an animal human beings that got in so condition there was he he come down in in a manger a little old cave stable on the side of the hill there in Bethlehem him where Harlot's son had founded the little city many years before. And now Lord, we find out that one night a cold night. It was said to him, "Rabbi, we want to go home with you tonight." And he said, "Well, now the birds, they have nest and and the foxes have den, but I I I don't have a even a place to lay my head. And that's the way they let him die like the on the street. The heavenly father can the Christ the kind the people today see that that is that great gift and many here tonight more than a dozen I guess raised their hands that they wanted to receive the Holy Spirit. May there just like the wise men, maybe none of the rest of the congregation will even see what goes on. And this star, this mystic light passed over the observatories for two years before people even kept time. Then before watches, they kept time for the stars. Nobody, no historian wrote of it. No one, no nothing about it. And yet it was there. These wise men with the appropriate gift was guided right through to it. May that same light come into every heart here tonight that's setting present. It may not be no emotion. It may not be this that and maybe no one else know it just like the wise men but may something so be settled in these men, women, boys and girls hearts tonight that that gift of God will anoint their life that from this night on they'll be changed. They won't be no more like they used to be. They'll be a changed preacher from now on. May they like the wise men turn aside and not go back to the fashions of the world of Herod the king's palace but being warned of God they turned aside. Granted Lord tonight I pray that every wise man boy or girl in here tonight man or woman that's wise enough to turn aside from the things of the world tonight don't go back no more after this day after this this passing of this day and night. No more will they go back to the things of the world. But maybe they be wise and this little mystic voice that caused them to raise their hands and say, "Yes, I want God's gift." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May that same thing that caused them to raise their hands identify him tonight with his death, burial, and resurrection by giving them the Holy Spirit. May they turn aside. May these women here tonight, Lord, it's had such a hard time to keep from coping with the world. let their hair grow and dress ladylike and take off this makeup and stuff that's artificial. It shows it it kind of identifies them that they're not healthy. They they're there's something wrong. And may tonight this little mystic life, Lord, that caused them to raise their hands. May they say, "Lord, I'm turning aside from the things of the world tonight. These men that hasn't had the the the real something that would talk to their wives and cause them to turn aside and the things that they do. May we all together, Lord, just turn aside tonight, being warned of God by the strange little message of the the light of God that strikes upon our hearts. May we turn aside tonight and and live for you the rest of our days. Go home with you by another way than what we have been traveling. Grant it, Lord. Make us better Christians. a Christian here tonight, Father, that's accepted you and believes on you and they've tried to live a Christian life, but tonight, may they turn aside, may they receive that gift. Oh, God. It's it's a it's a despised way. Women will be called oldfashioned. They'll be called everything. And men will be called fanatics, but we're we're ready, Lord. Uh Holy Spirit, turn us aside right now. Turn me aside, Lord. I I I don't want to even go uh any way that would lead me away from you, Lord. I want to go just the way you had me to go. I want the gift of my heart to be so perfect that it'll identify you, Lord, on earth. That you're not dead. You're living. You're the God of the living, not the God of the dead. The dead is covered all over with flies and blowflies creating germs and and more blowflies. It's like the man takes his first drink, smokes his first cigarette, tells his first lie, goes out on his wife for the first time, or the wife that goes out on the husband or does some things that's wrong just like a blowfly struck them and they they accumulate by the glo and the blows and filth because it's on a dead soul on the inside. Evil spirits glo and one evil spirit caused them to do something else and another come to do something else because they did this. God, may they turn aside and come to life. May they rise and the angels of God come down with the gifts of eternal life, Lord, and go from victory onto victory. Granted, Father, we turn aside tonight from the things of the world and the cares of the world, warned of God that the time is at hand. Jesus is coming back to the earth. And may the great Holy Spirit give us tonight that eternal life that we're looking for. strength that Lord, we're we're just pray that you'll grant these blessings to as we ask them in Jesus Christ's name with our head. Wise men long ago came to that
