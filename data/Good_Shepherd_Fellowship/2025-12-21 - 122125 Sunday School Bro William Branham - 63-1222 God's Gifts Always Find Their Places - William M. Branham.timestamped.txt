[1:45] to talk to you on the word of the Lord.
[1:47] And um so brother Neville asked me and I
[1:50] had several little Christmas texts that
[1:52] I've been using. One of them up at
[1:55] Phoenix and down at Tucson, different
[1:57] places around there, a regular Christmas
[1:59] message. And I thought tonight I'll just
[2:02] speak on a little something here that
[2:04] the Lord put up on my mind recently as I
[2:07] was up in Colorado and I was thinking on
[2:10] something at Christmas time and I got
[2:12] about five or six of the little jotss
[2:14] wrote down here scriptures and things
[2:16] that I don't I guess brother Neville all
[2:18] ministers do that you seem like
[2:20] something comes to you and you jot it
[2:21] down wait a while you put it down I put
[2:24] on a tablet of paper just on a tablet of
[2:26] paper then when I called on sometime I
[2:28] look back and say what was this now got
[2:30] a hold of and that's way when we were
[2:32] called real quick you know used to be I
[2:34] when I was younger I could just my mind
[2:37] was so I could just think this right now
[2:39] and I didn't have to wait I think 10
[2:42] days ago I was at certain certain place
[2:43] that's the texture it is here it goes
[2:45] you know since I've passed a few
[2:47] milestones brother Hagen bottom and
[2:49] crossed a few rivers that it just don't
[2:51] come that way no more getting a little
[2:54] far up the road but as brother Neville
[2:57] said a while ago we're getting closer
[2:58] &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Closer home. It's good to be
[3:01] back home. I coming back while awful
[3:05] snowy and is here the accidents and
[3:08] things. So many of them on the road and
[3:09] people being killed and just think how
[3:12] many hundreds will lose their life now
[3:13] between tonight and after New Year's.
[3:16] How many Americans will die
[3:18] &gt;&gt; and you know some of us might be right
[3:20] here tonight.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; And it just depends on now that our
[3:24] condition before God. It's a sad nation.
[3:27] This brother said sadness everywhere and
[3:32] our flag has been hanging 30 days half
[3:35] mass all because of sin and people who
[3:38] would not accept God's way of of of
[3:42] things. Even if we can disagree with a
[3:44] person, if we can't yet do it in a
[3:46] brotherly way and then see if Christ is
[3:49] in the heart then no matter how much you
[3:51] disagree with a man, you've still got
[3:53] love for him and respect. I disagree
[3:56] with many man times, but still I've
[3:59] never seen one that I disagree with that
[4:01] I ever thought of any more than put my
[4:02] arm around him and call him my brother
[4:04] and try to help him as best I could. I
[4:06] disagree with him because that I think
[4:08] maybe that upon disagreeing that he what
[4:12] he believes that I might not believe
[4:13] just like him, but uh and so forth and I
[4:17] might try to project my way to him as he
[4:19] projects his to me and get them
[4:20] together, comb out and see what we got.
[4:23] But a disagreement like that just far as
[4:25] it comes to we should never get angry or
[4:28] want to hurt or destroy or anything. We
[4:31] should always be trying to build up.
[4:36] Got a cold spell going on here, haven't
[4:38] we?
[4:40] &gt;&gt; 72 when I left Tucson
[4:43] and uh when the sun went down, got dark,
[4:45] it's still 69. So they come back up
[4:48] here. I'm just a shivering all up.
[4:52] uh all that snowy road and below zero
[4:55] and ice and everything. I get all used
[4:58] to it again. It's so strange how you can
[5:00] get so climatized. It's such a a little
[5:03] way. And since I left you, I didn't have
[5:06] hardly a chance to get survived up. I
[5:09] got a like a sinus in the weather in
[5:12] here. And as I get older and I was born
[5:14] and raised in here, but when you see
[5:17] when you're young, you got something you
[5:19] throw off. But when you get older, well,
[5:20] you begin to find out that something
[5:22] isn't there. It used to be you could
[5:24] just forget about it. You there's
[5:26] something there that that just won't
[5:28] throw off like it did when he was a kid.
[5:29] So, uh find out that way that I climb
[5:35] for an old man kind of helps a little
[5:37] bit. I remember coming down that Guna
[5:40] Pike up there as a kid 7 8 10 12 14
[5:43] years old. No shoes on. tennis shoes dip
[5:46] eight or 10 below zero and tennis shoes
[5:48] the toes out of them and not now ain't
[5:50] walking down like the street year but
[5:52] busting the snow there's no automobiles
[5:54] come down might be a wagon track once in
[5:56] a while come down that highway of a
[5:58] morning little old coat on no shirt and
[6:00] it pinned up like this no more than what
[6:02] I got on right now soaking wet to my
[6:04] knees go right on in and pay no
[6:06] attention to it see hardly have a cold
[6:09] but that was about 45 years ago so whole
[6:13] lot of weeks he's gone a lot of miles
[6:15] and build up on this theometer, you
[6:16] know. So, we just don't take it like we
[6:19] used to. I see brother Cats raised his
[6:21] head up. You're too young to think now.
[6:26] Wait till you get up where brother
[6:27] Neville and I are and then then you'll
[6:29] you'll think a lot of things.
[6:33] We can sound. Well, we've had great
[6:35] times in the Lord.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord has blessed us
[6:38] tremendously and I'm so thankful and I
[6:43] come back I think next Sunday the Lord
[6:45] willing I if brother Neville doesn't
[6:47] care
[6:48] &gt;&gt; I got a service at least Sunday morning
[6:50] and maybe Sunday night a healing service
[6:53] for Sunday night.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Sunday morning we got an important
[6:56] message that the Lord be willing for me
[6:58] to deliver it. I haven't thought up my
[6:59] text no more than just my text yet. no
[7:01] context to it because I I am not without
[7:06] without any you know revelation from the
[7:09] Lord but just in myself. Uh I want to
[7:12] express something Sunday that I hope
[7:14] will kind of help out a little bit along
[7:18] these ways. Uh I've got to go down into
[7:20] the field and I've got just every day
[7:23] almost taken up everywhere. I think
[7:25] Billy was telling me one of the
[7:26] itinerary that I got two or three days
[7:29] that I could come home in April after I
[7:31] leave here, go back to Tucson. That's
[7:33] about settled then. And then on till
[7:36] next November, October when I get back
[7:38] this side again from overseas. Now
[7:43] two more days till one more day is be
[7:46] Monday. T is Tuesday's Christmas Eve.
[7:48] Tuesday is Christmas Eve.
[7:50] Is it awful to see that this great
[7:53] holiday that we're approaching is
[7:55] approached in the manner that is
[7:57] approached in?
[7:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; It's such a pitiful thing, such a a
[8:03] rational thing to think that that
[8:07] rabbits and a a myth called Chris
[8:10] Crinkle, Santa Claus, and everything has
[8:13] taken the real value away from what
[8:16] Christmas is. Now, we don't we We don't
[8:20] know and I certainly do not believe I
[8:22] just coming down wife back there and I
[8:25] coming down the road was listening on an
[8:26] astronomer that now they just fell on
[8:29] the idea which an astronomer told me
[8:31] many many years ago when I was just a
[8:34] game warden here in Indiana when they
[8:37] told me that how those stars came
[8:41] together just like that first astronomer
[8:43] did and that form what they said would
[8:45] be a natural thing that happens
[8:47] everybody said night 800 years or
[8:50] something like that and it reforms
[8:52] itself again of Sardis and Jupiter and I
[8:55] forget Mark Meyers or I know that's
[8:58] wrong it's some the stars how they speed
[9:00] when they cross their orbits in line of
[9:02] the earth and this astronomer tonight
[9:04] was trying to tell that it actually was
[9:06] a natural thing I I don't I don't accept
[9:09] that I believe it was a supernatural
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amend
[9:12] things is supernatural with God he is
[9:15] supernatural
[9:16] &gt;&gt; and um and I look down and know that
[9:19] this is facing back now to April, I go,
[9:21] "Lord, willing for me to live that long,
[9:23] I'd be 55 years old." Then I I know the
[9:27] uh but looking back on my life and I
[9:29] wonder where it happened from that first
[9:30] little Christmases when we hang up her
[9:32] stockings and mama would get we probably
[9:34] get an orange and and two or three
[9:36] little pieces of striped candy and that
[9:38] was a great Christmas to us. But you
[9:42] know the kids they they look forward for
[9:44] them gifts. We we find out that that
[9:47] Christmas is to the is mainly children.
[9:50] They they look forward to that nowadays.
[9:52] It is turned off to the children, but it
[9:54] really should be adults.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; It should be a teaching of children what
[9:58] real Christmas is.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; And I totally do not believe that that
[10:03] Christ could be born on a 25th day of
[10:05] December in Judea because it's colder
[10:06] than it is out here now. See, and how
[10:09] could the shepherds be keeping their
[10:10] flocks for night and and then the
[10:12] taxation and everything and Mary having
[10:14] to come that far from way down in
[10:16] Bethlehem up into Judea up into
[10:19] Jerusalem or other for the taxation. I I
[10:22] I hardly could could uh could believe
[10:25] that or come up. I believe she come to
[10:27] Nazareth and so um when how that that
[10:31] could be done, it could not be uh be
[10:33] done. But u I believe that Christ was
[10:36] born in a spring because in every way he
[10:39] was a lamb. They you notice he was born
[10:42] in a barn and not a house. And when they
[10:44] took him to the cross, the others, as
[10:47] far as we know, they never said about
[10:49] him leading them, but they led him. Did
[10:51] you know a lamb or sheep has to be led
[10:54] to the slaughter?
[10:56] &gt;&gt; It it will not go to the slaughter. You
[10:57] you have to lead it there. And usually
[10:59] it's a goat that leads the sheep and and
[11:02] the killing pins. They have a goat and
[11:04] the goat will walk up this runway to
[11:06] gets up to get the sheep started down
[11:08] the runway to be killed and the goat
[11:09] will jump out. But when they come a time
[11:11] to go kill the goat, he really kicks up
[11:13] a bus and he has to go in. Of course,
[11:15] you couldn't blame him. But but it's a a
[11:18] thing how a sheep has to be led. And he
[11:20] was led to the slaughter. They led him.
[11:23] He was a lamb. And I believe in that way
[11:26] being allto together nature. And lambs
[11:28] are born in March, April, and somewhere
[11:30] along in there, not later than May. And
[11:33] I don't believe it was anything before
[11:34] March and anything after May. sometime
[11:36] along in there. But when uh the church
[11:41] Christianity was married into Romanism
[11:45] was at the NASA council when they
[11:48] accepted the Roman uh uh nation accepted
[11:52] the Christianity and made what they call
[11:54] the universal religion was Christianity.
[11:57] They made the universal religion and
[11:59] they worshiped idols and they had a sun
[12:01] god. And right now from the from the
[12:04] 21st to the 25th, the sun almost stands
[12:08] in its same track as it's passing. What
[12:11] do you call that? Um, you know, I
[12:15] thought I knew it, but I can't think of
[12:17] when the suns is it gains so much time
[12:20] and loses so much time until the 21st
[12:23] between 21st and 25th December. I forget
[12:25] what they call it. What? No. No. The
[12:28] eclipse is when it passes, the sun and
[12:30] moon passes together. It's a something
[12:32] in there. Oh, I I I can almost see it
[12:35] but can't right now. However, it's that
[12:38] stand still of the sun which is called
[12:40] by the Romans. That's when the circus
[12:41] went on. It was called the sun god's
[12:45] birthday. They celebrated it from the
[12:48] 21st to the 25th of December. So then
[12:51] being that this was converted Rome into
[12:55] a Christianity was accepted in their way
[12:59] in Rome then they said we'll make the
[13:03] same celebration and pay son of God's
[13:06] birthday see the son god Jupiter's
[13:09] birthday then son of god's birthday 25th
[13:13] of December and that but what difference
[13:15] does it make see today when we are even
[13:19] if it's If it's doing it in July or
[13:22] August or whenever it might be, it's
[13:24] still the sacredness of remembering that
[13:28] God gave us the hope that we have in us.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; And now you say, "Well, the rest of them
[13:35] is all Santa Claus and going all." Well,
[13:38] we just might as well do it. No, sir.
[13:40] No. This is not a pagan celebration to
[13:43] us.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; This is a sacred hour. If there had been
[13:47] no Christmas, there would been no
[13:48] resurrection. And if there had been no
[13:50] Christmas, there had been no love. There
[13:52] had been no peace. There had been no
[13:53] hereafter for the a believer. If there
[13:57] had been no Christmas, and now you say,
[14:00] well, if the rest of the world, they
[14:02] just Well, see, the lightning and the
[14:05] black cloudy sky show that there can be
[14:08] light in the time of darkness.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; These lights tonight prove that
[14:12] &gt;&gt; that there can be light in the time of
[14:15] darkness. And when does light shine its
[14:17] best? In darkness.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You turn these lights on, daytime,
[14:20] sun's shining in, you hardly notice
[14:22] they're on. But just one little wee
[14:24] light will shine real bright in a time
[14:27] of darkness. And right now is a darkness
[14:30] when every Christian should give a
[14:32] testimony of the hope that's in him.
[14:34] Jesus Christ, the son of God,
[14:36] &gt;&gt; not some Chris Crinkle that was born
[14:40] back on some kind of a tree lit up, went
[14:43] out through a forest one night. Some
[14:44] fiction story. There's no bottom to it.
[14:47] But we believe solidly on the promised
[14:50] word of God of a coming Messiah and he
[14:53] was born on Christmas day 20 or 2,000
[14:58] years ago we believe. So tonight we're
[15:02] going to speak a little bit on a
[15:03] different way. I guess your pastor's
[15:05] already spoken and probably speak
[15:06] Wednesday night again. Uh because I I
[15:09] know he laid back some text or something
[15:11] that gave me this platform tonight and I
[15:14] want him to bring it. I want to listen
[15:15] to him. But just before now we do this,
[15:18] let's just bow our heads again for a
[15:19] moment of prayer.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, this great sacred
[15:23] moment
[15:25] when we think of the different things in
[15:27] the scripture here that everywhere we go
[15:30] back in the Old Testament speaks of that
[15:33] day when God shall send his son. how
[15:36] those prophets back there allotted their
[15:39] time for prophecy of the word of God to
[15:41] come to them. And they prophesied in
[15:44] their days and fortold the things that
[15:47] would come to pass. And we see it all
[15:49] met there in Bethlehem that night when
[15:52] God so loved the world that he gave his
[15:55] only begotten son. We thank thee for
[15:58] this. And now Lord, tonight as we settle
[16:00] down here to to speak on thy word, and
[16:03] it's so sacred, Lord, that's the reason
[16:05] we like to speak to you first. And we
[16:07] ask that you'll open our understanding
[16:10] to thy word. In Jesus' name we ask it.
[16:13] Amen.
[16:15] I want to read some scripture here. Just
[16:18] a regular Christmas story for the
[16:20] scripture found in and uh Matthew the 2
[16:23] chapter. And while you're turned that
[16:25] in, John 3:16.
[16:28] And uh the other night up at Phoenix, if
[16:32] you tape people here, listen to the
[16:33] tapes. Uh likely listen to that one. Why
[16:37] Jesus had to come to Bethlehem? Why did
[16:40] he have to do it? And those symbols
[16:42] there of David laying and and wait up on
[16:46] the mountain looking down and seeing the
[16:48] Philistine army garrisoned. And I
[16:50] compared that with exactly today and
[16:53] find out that Bethlehem what it means.
[16:56] And Christ is our Bethlehem and can
[16:58] prove that every man that's born of God
[17:00] is born in Bethlehem because Christ is
[17:03] Bethlehem is that's what he was the
[17:05] bread of life. And Beth B means means
[17:09] house. Eel is God and Elhhem is elim
[17:14] which means uh bread and
[17:18] house of God's bread and Jesus Christ
[17:23] was the house of God's bread of eternal
[17:27] life and every man that's born into
[17:29] Christ you're born into Bethlehem God's
[17:33] house of bread and how that the leagues
[17:36] of these churches today is garrison like
[17:38] Philistines to keep the people from and
[17:41] how that those gallant men knowing that
[17:43] David was anointed and was going to come
[17:46] king someday very unpopular then because
[17:48] he was a fugitive among his people but
[17:51] one day his call come they had gallop
[17:53] man with him and remember those men were
[17:56] gentiles most every one of them were
[17:59] gentile a very beautiful type of today
[18:02] and one man was so gallant he killed 800
[18:04] men with one with his spear himself in
[18:06] one day another one standing the field
[18:09] little and an army come up a troop and
[18:11] all of them run and he stood there and
[18:13] slew man until his arms was tired and
[18:16] then another one how he jumped into a
[18:18] pit and killed a lion on a snowy day
[18:20] single-handed and a full or an Egyptian
[18:23] run at him with a long spear and he took
[18:26] a stick and knocked this spear out of
[18:27] his hand took the spear and killed the
[18:28] Egyptian himself and killed 300 captains
[18:31] and get a great man David crying out if
[18:34] I could drink once more see from that
[18:36] well Sorry.
[18:58] Get a great man David crying out if I
[19:01] could drink once more. See from that
[19:03] well where he used to water his sheep
[19:04] when he went out of a morning from the
[19:06] corral they want a drink of water and
[19:08] these men pulled their swords and fought
[19:10] through 15 miles a man brought this
[19:14] water back and David said far be that I
[19:16] drink it and he poured it upon the
[19:18] ground as a drink offering to the Lord
[19:20] what a beautiful type of the same thing
[19:23] of this John 3:16 tonight God so loved
[19:26] the world that he gave his only begotten
[19:28] son and what did Christ do the life that
[19:31] he had to live eternally. He poured it
[19:33] up on the ground from his veins, his
[19:35] natural life upon the ground as a sin
[19:38] offering for us. And how the Gentiles
[19:42] today, man of honor, man, great man,
[19:45] taking the sword and standing there and
[19:46] cutting their way through to get a fresh
[19:49] drink of water for Christ. Our David
[19:51] which is very unpopular today but our
[19:54] David which we know is coming in power
[19:56] and going to every nation under
[19:58] his feet like that and root him with an
[20:00] rod of iron and real gallant man
[20:03] standing with the word of God and
[20:04] chopping from side to side fearlessly
[20:07] because we know he's coming in power.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Let's read now after John 3:16. Let's
[20:14] read the visit of the magi of St.
[20:17] Matthew the 2 chapter. Now when Jesus is
[20:21] born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days
[20:24] of Herod the king, behold there came
[20:26] wise men from the from the east to
[20:28] Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he that's
[20:30] born, King of the Jews? For we have seen
[20:33] his star in the east, and are come to
[20:35] worship him?" When Herod the king heard
[20:37] these things, he was troubled in all
[20:39] Jerusalem with him. And when he had
[20:41] gathered the chief priests and the
[20:43] scribes of the people together, he
[20:46] demanded them where Christ should be
[20:48] born, they said unto him, of Bethlehem
[20:50] of Judea, for thus it is written by the
[20:54] prophet,
[20:56] and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah,
[20:58] art thou not the least among the princes
[21:01] of Judah? Out of thee shall come a
[21:04] governor that shall rule
[21:07] my people Israel." Herod, when he had
[21:10] privately called the wise men, inquired
[21:12] of them diligently what time the star
[21:15] appeared.
[21:17] And he sent them to Bethlehem and said,
[21:19] "Go and search diligently for the young
[21:21] child. And when you have found him,
[21:23] bring me word again that I may come and
[21:26] worship him also." When they heard the
[21:30] king, they departed. And lo, the star
[21:32] which they saw in the east went before
[21:36] them till it came and stood over where
[21:38] the young child was. And when they saw
[21:41] the star, they rejoiced with exceeding
[21:44] great joy. And when they were come into
[21:48] the house, they saw the young child with
[21:51] Mary, his mother, and fell down and
[21:55] worshiped him. And they had opened their
[21:59] treasures. They presented to him gifts,
[22:02] gold of frankincense, and marrow. And
[22:06] being warned of God in a dream that they
[22:09] should not depart, they should not
[22:11] return to Herod, they departed into
[22:14] their own country another way.
[22:17] Very strange here. How that God in a
[22:21] lesser way, God does speak to people
[22:24] through dreams. I believe that. But how
[22:27] that God in this case used uh
[22:32] secondarily. Now a dream is a dream if
[22:35] it's interpreted rightly. It is a same
[22:38] as a vision. If it's a dream and being
[22:41] interpreted, God's used it since way
[22:43] back in the Old Testament and down
[22:44] through the ages and promised in the
[22:46] last days to use it again. how people
[22:48] can overeat and and so forth and get
[22:51] nightmares and it's not it's not real
[22:53] spiritual dreams that don't ring up when
[22:55] it when you read it. And some of it
[22:57] might seem right, but yet there's real
[23:00] spiritual dreams. And we know here at
[23:01] the tabernacle, God gives people dreams
[23:04] and they are interpreted and they come
[23:06] to pass and they're real. But it's a
[23:08] secondary way of doing it. See now the
[23:12] reason it was done then it was because
[23:15] there was no prophet in the land at that
[23:17] time to interpret the dream. See there
[23:20] was no prophet to interpret the dreams
[23:22] like Joseph and and Daniel and those
[23:24] prophets of old. They had had a prophet
[23:26] for 400 years. And God used a dream to
[23:31] for the welfare of his own child. He
[23:33] did. He told Joseph when he was a just
[23:35] man, not willingly to make her a public
[23:37] example, was minded to put her away
[23:39] privately. No doubt she told him the
[23:42] visit of Gabriel and so forth and what
[23:44] he had said, but when he saw her to be
[23:46] mother, it was too unusual. You know, it
[23:49] just it was something very different.
[23:51] And you know, that's what's the matter
[23:52] today. God does things unusual and is so
[23:56] unusual till even just man can't see it.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Joseph couldn't understand it. He was
[24:01] too unusual. Yeah,
[24:03] &gt;&gt; he was a good man. Nothing wrong with
[24:05] him. He was a good man, a just man, but
[24:07] it was so unusual. See, Joseph probably
[24:10] 40 years old or 45, something like that
[24:13] they claim when he and Mary was engaged.
[24:15] But here we find something that never
[24:17] had happened. A woman exposed to this
[24:20] man and yet be found to be mother. And
[24:23] it was so unusual. Joseph was mighty to
[24:26] put her away. But right at that crucial
[24:28] moment, God sent his angel and appeared
[24:30] to him in a dream and said, "Don't fear
[24:33] to take thee, Mary, thy wife, for that
[24:34] which is conceived in her of the Holy
[24:36] Ghost." What a newborn faith Joseph must
[24:39] have had when he rose up in there. See,
[24:41] he never had need any interpretation.
[24:43] The dream wasn't symbols. It was right
[24:44] straight out. Don't fear to take Mary
[24:47] thy wife. For that which is conceived in
[24:49] her is of the Holy Ghost. There's no
[24:51] prophet to give the interpretation. So
[24:53] it had to come directly right straight
[24:55] like that to God from God to Joseph. Now
[24:59] God taking that secondarily away. What
[25:01] does it teach us right here before we
[25:03] hit our text? Here's what it teaches us
[25:06] that God can use every faculty of our
[25:09] being if it's commit surrendered to him.
[25:11] Amen.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; You can use our mind, our dreams, our
[25:13] subconscious, our first conscious, our
[25:15] tongue, our songs, our eyes, our
[25:18] everything that we have can be used of
[25:21] God if it's committed to God. See,
[25:24] &gt;&gt; amen.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Everything that you are committed to
[25:26] God, he'll use every outlet and every
[25:29] part of you, he'll use it. No matter
[25:31] what it is, he'll use it if it's
[25:34] sanctified to his purpose and call.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Our Lord help.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Now, tonight we're going to speak on
[25:40] gifts. I want.
