[56:28] with his peculiar people

[57:32] with singing
[57:35] know ye that the lord
[57:38] he is god
[57:41] it is he that have made us
[57:45] i want to emphasize on that verse
[57:47] because of a portion of my inspiration
[57:50] is coming from there
[57:51] know ye that the lord
[57:54] elohim
[57:55] amen
[57:56] amen
[57:58] know he that the lord
[58:00] jehovah
[58:02] is elohim that's that in hebrew that's
[58:04] the way it is
[58:05] know ye that jehovah
[58:08] yahweh he is elohim
[58:13] it is he that have made us
[58:17] and not we ourself
[58:21] amen
[58:23] he's the one that have designed us
[58:28] he's the one that have craft our ways
[58:34] and not ourself
[58:36] sometimes we think
[58:39] we are having our own way
[58:42] but god's people are peculiar
[58:45] and the way he made us
[58:48] is very peculiar
[58:50] no matter how much we try to imitate and
[58:53] impersonate we there is no two persons
[58:56] the same that's right
[58:59] thank you lord
[59:01] know ye that the lord
[59:06] he is god and it is he that have made us
[59:09] and now we ourself
[59:12] we are his people
[59:17] and
[59:18] the sheep of his posture
[59:24] enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[59:27] and into his couch with praise
[59:29] be thankful
[59:31] unto him
[59:32] why because he made you
[59:37] praise the lord
[59:39] amen
[59:40] the only way to be able to appreciate
[59:42] the way that god made you is for you to
[59:44] be thankful to him
[59:48] praise the lord and if you are not
[59:50] appreciating the way that god made you
[59:53] you are not being thankful to him
[1:00:00] praise the lord
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:04] be thankful unto him and bless his name
[1:00:06] for the lord is good and his mercy is
[1:00:09] everlasting
[1:00:11] and his truth endureth for all
[1:00:14] generations
[1:00:15] praise the lord the lord bless you you
[1:00:17] may have your seat let's go to
[1:00:19] ask chapter 17
[1:00:21] the book of acts chapter 17 and pretty
[1:00:24] soon you will see where
[1:00:25] we
[1:00:26] are drawing our our thoughts from but we
[1:00:28] want to talk on the peculiar god with
[1:00:31] his peculiar people
[1:00:33] over and over john right on from exeter
[1:00:35] god started speaking about his people
[1:00:37] being a peculiar treasure
[1:00:39] so we want to look into that this
[1:00:41] morning and trust that the lord will be
[1:00:43] able to help us praise the lord
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:50] glory be to god
[1:00:52] i know those brothers from uh from iowa
[1:00:55] they you know they have they have a way
[1:00:57] of holding the service down so if i stay
[1:00:59] along this morning you blame them
[1:01:02] they have a way of just grounding the
[1:01:04] preacher
[1:01:06] they either run you out of your notes or
[1:01:08] they ground you
[1:01:12] danny i'm putting a lot of
[1:01:13] responsibility on you buddy
[1:01:22] god bless you
[1:01:24] amen as chapter 17 let's read verse 26
[1:01:30] house chapter 17.
[1:01:32] let's read verse 26.
[1:01:45] praise the lord
[1:01:46] this was at athens on mars hill
[1:01:50] verse let's read from verse 24 god that
[1:01:53] made the word in all things therein
[1:01:57] seeing that he is the lord just the same
[1:02:00] as david said in the son the lord of
[1:02:03] heaven and earth do all if not in temple
[1:02:06] made with hints neither is worship with
[1:02:09] man's hands as though he need anything
[1:02:13] seeing
[1:02:14] he gave it to all life and breath into
[1:02:18] all things and have made
[1:02:22] of one blood
[1:02:24] all nation now this scripture is very
[1:02:27] powerful because
[1:02:28] the word blood here in the greek is uh
[1:02:32] uh amara if i pre if i'm if i'm
[1:02:35] pronouncing the right it means that god
[1:02:38] from one race
[1:02:42] made all men
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:50] god
[1:02:51] from one blood
[1:02:53] meaning from one race
[1:02:58] make all men are we together
[1:03:04] and he has he have made of one blood all
[1:03:07] nations of men that
[1:03:09] uh
[1:03:10] of men fall to dwarf on the face of the
[1:03:13] earth and have determined
[1:03:16] the times
[1:03:19] before i pointed
[1:03:22] and the bounds of the habitation of i
[1:03:25] had a translation that i wanted to read
[1:03:27] to you i forget i did not add it to my
[1:03:29] notes so uh uh uh but it it
[1:03:34] right here it expressed how god
[1:03:37] from one race
[1:03:39] made all men and distribute us to our
[1:03:42] different nations
[1:03:44] and he determined our time
[1:03:48] on the face of the earth that's very
[1:03:50] powerful
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:56] because we'll realize as uh if we have
[1:03:59] time to look into it that you know that
[1:04:01] brother branham says it's a place that
[1:04:03] we grow up is the environment that
[1:04:05] changed our color scheme
[1:04:09] praise the lord
[1:04:15] but
[1:04:18] of one race
[1:04:22] that is the human race amen
[1:04:26] so god of one race
[1:04:28] made all men
[1:04:30] praise the lord
[1:04:32] so
[1:04:34] if you look at the word peculiar this
[1:04:36] blew my mind blew my mind
[1:04:39] it took me it took it took me off my
[1:04:42] feet
[1:04:43] so if my mind is blown in my feet i'm
[1:04:46] off my feet then you should know that
[1:04:47] i'm dead
[1:04:50] it blew my mind the word peculiar in
[1:04:53] this origin
[1:04:55] it's a latin word that starts
[1:04:58] uh pecued means cattle
[1:05:03] it means cattle
[1:05:05] cattle like a sheep fall you know like
[1:05:07] like you get cattles
[1:05:10] and it also comes from a word called
[1:05:14] peculium which means property
[1:05:17] you know
[1:05:18] and
[1:05:21] it means private property
[1:05:25] and peculiar in the in the latin means
[1:05:29] particular
[1:05:31] so if you if you think about it as we'll
[1:05:34] go and look in the scripture you realize
[1:05:36] that
[1:05:39] like like david said in the psalm
[1:05:41] knowing that he is our god
[1:05:44] we are his people
[1:05:46] the sheep
[1:05:48] of his posture
[1:05:51] so that's why we are peculiar to him
[1:05:54] because god looks at us as his cuddles
[1:06:00] the sheep of his pasture
[1:06:05] praise the lord
[1:06:08] and it's not just only
[1:06:10] a group of herbs of cattle but a private
[1:06:14] property
[1:06:17] a private
[1:06:18] property
[1:06:25] that's how he looks at each and every
[1:06:27] one of us we are his private property we
[1:06:30] don't belong to no bishop no man no
[1:06:33] church
[1:06:34] we don't belong to no nation
[1:06:37] we are god's heritage
[1:06:40] we are his private property
[1:06:49] praise the lord you see we belong to god
[1:06:52] so much that it's only god that
[1:06:54] understand us and we don't even
[1:06:55] understand ourselves
[1:07:00] that's that's that is such a hole that
[1:07:03] he has on us
[1:07:08] that
[1:07:11] he knows our laying down he knows our
[1:07:14] waking up
[1:07:16] he knows our going out and our coming
[1:07:19] he number the hairs on our head
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:23] praise the lord he know which train is
[1:07:26] one
[1:07:27] and which one is the last number he
[1:07:29] numbered him now that he count them but
[1:07:31] he numbered he said this one is one this
[1:07:34] other one here is two the other one is
[1:07:36] three
[1:07:43] praise the praise the lord
[1:07:46] and when the lord wants you to start
[1:07:47] losing your head he says well let's
[1:07:49] section four leave your head
[1:07:51] then you get a little ball here you get
[1:07:52] a little ball on his eye
[1:07:54] he calls them by number
[1:07:57] praise the lord
[1:07:58] [Laughter]
[1:08:05] i better want to understand what i'm
[1:08:07] talking about so
[1:08:10] glory be to god
[1:08:14] the hebrew carried the same sense of
[1:08:16] word it means possession
[1:08:18] it means property
[1:08:21] value property peculiar treasure
[1:08:26] amen
[1:08:28] so let's go to exodus chapter 19.
[1:08:31] we want we just want to trace do a
[1:08:33] little tracy and then we will get into
[1:08:35] getting to preaching amen exodus chapter
[1:08:38] 19 uh let's let's
[1:08:40] let's get in chapter 19
[1:08:50] there you know uh we've been taught by
[1:08:54] the prophet never to take one verse to
[1:08:56] make a doctrine you can never take one
[1:08:58] verse in the bible neither can you take
[1:09:00] one quote in the message to make a
[1:09:01] doctrine out of it you have to run it
[1:09:03] through the scripture amen
[1:09:05] because then you see the bigger picture
[1:09:07] so exodus chapter 19
[1:09:14] listen to this
[1:09:18] verse 3 and moses went up
[1:09:20] unto god and the lord called unto him
[1:09:23] out
[1:09:25] of the mountain saying
[1:09:28] thou shalt thou say unto the house of
[1:09:30] jacob and tell the children of israel ye
[1:09:33] have seen
[1:09:35] what i did unto their egyptians and how
[1:09:38] i beared you on eagle wings
[1:09:41] and brought you unto myself
[1:09:45] praise the lord
[1:09:46] amen we never saw no physical wings
[1:09:50] that the children of israel was bearing
[1:09:52] on even though they were walking through
[1:09:54] the the red sea they were walking all
[1:09:56] over the place but god says
[1:09:58] supernaturally i bear you on eagle wings
[1:10:02] in the sense that you are under my
[1:10:03] protection
[1:10:05] all of those chairs that were running
[1:10:07] from egypt could never harm you even
[1:10:10] though you saw the dust in the air you
[1:10:13] saw the the the the you heard the noise
[1:10:16] of the cherub you could see the sword of
[1:10:18] the egyptian but you were all my wings
[1:10:21] you are honor my protection
[1:10:28] praise the lord and how i bury you on
[1:10:30] ego wings and brought you to myself
[1:10:33] listen to this now now therefore if you
[1:10:37] will obey my voice indeed
[1:10:40] and keep my coveting
[1:10:42] then yes shall be a peculiar treasure
[1:10:46] unto me now when you read this it sounds
[1:10:49] like god was saying if you do this
[1:10:52] then
[1:10:54] you're going to be this
[1:10:56] is that how it sounds
[1:10:59] praise the lord or i'm the one reading
[1:11:01] it wrong
[1:11:04] if you obey my voice indeed and keep my
[1:11:08] coveting
[1:11:09] then yes shall be a peculiar treasure
[1:11:12] unto me
[1:11:13] praise the lord above all people
[1:11:18] for all the earth is mine
[1:11:21] but i have pulled you aside to make you
[1:11:24] a peculiar treasure
[1:11:26] all the earth is my all the people
[1:11:29] living on the earth i created them but i
[1:11:32] have pulled you aside to make you a
[1:11:35] peculiar treasure
[1:11:38] are we together deuteronomy chapter 14.
[1:12:02] praise the lord
[1:12:07] 14 less uh
[1:12:10] let's read
[1:12:22] now verse 14 let's chapter 14 let's read
[1:12:24] verse 1 ye are the children
[1:12:27] of the lord your god
[1:12:30] ye shall not cut
[1:12:33] yourself not make any borders between
[1:12:36] your eyes for the dead
[1:12:39] for thou art unholy
[1:12:42] people
[1:12:43] unto the lord thy god
[1:12:46] and the lord have chosen thee
[1:12:49] to be a peculiar people unto himself
[1:12:53] now
[1:12:54] as you all know above all the nations
[1:12:57] that
[1:12:58] are upon the earth as you all know the
[1:13:02] people traveling in the wilderness moses
[1:13:05] speaking to them in exeter and telling
[1:13:07] them how god beared them on eagle wings
[1:13:10] and god is saying if you will obey my
[1:13:12] voice and keep my covenant i will make
[1:13:14] you a peculiar people now here is moses
[1:13:17] here telling the people that they are
[1:13:19] peculiar
[1:13:20] so does that mean that they obey god's
[1:13:23] voice
[1:13:25] before god make them a peculiar people
[1:13:28] we know that israel was stubborn
[1:13:31] they were rebellious they wanted to go
[1:13:34] back to egypt they wanted to stone moses
[1:13:36] to death
[1:13:38] but how did they achieve
[1:13:42] being peculiar people
[1:13:45] now moses here is now telling them
[1:13:48] you are children of the lord your god
[1:13:52] so don't cut yourself don't make no uh
[1:13:55] you know a strange uh uh you know uh
[1:13:59] thing on your body
[1:14:00] for thou art a holy people unto the lord
[1:14:04] thy god
[1:14:06] and the lord has chosen thee
[1:14:10] to be a peculiar people now if god has
[1:14:14] choosing them then why the moses stole
[1:14:16] them if you will obey the voice of the
[1:14:19] lord and keep his covenant you will
[1:14:21] become a peculiar people
[1:14:24] praise the lord
[1:14:30] glory be to god
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:33] that's our god he's peculiar
[1:14:36] in a way he talks he's peculiar
[1:14:39] in the things that he does he's peculiar
[1:14:43] are we together
[1:14:45] let's take another verse here that that
[1:14:47] to be chapter 26
[1:14:51] that will be chapter 26 of the same the
[1:14:54] book of deuteronomy now you have to know
[1:14:56] that these the book of deuteronomy some
[1:14:58] of the last words of moses before he
[1:15:01] left the people
[1:15:03] are we together
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:06] because sometimes when you read the word
[1:15:09] and you you look into the the law that's
[1:15:12] the reason why paul the apostle taught
[1:15:14] us that no man can be justified by the
[1:15:16] law
[1:15:17] because the lord
[1:15:19] was not actually
[1:15:22] giving
[1:15:23] uh uh in the sense of a requirement for
[1:15:27] us to do
[1:15:28] as well as we study together and see
[1:15:31] what uh you know what uh the prophet god
[1:15:33] said the word the lord was actually the
[1:15:38] expression of god's thoughts
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:43] praise the lord it was the expression of
[1:15:46] god's thoughts god was expressing his
[1:15:49] thoughts you have to know that he kept
[1:15:52] this thought to himself
[1:15:55] for for as long as he existed
[1:16:01] now he's expressing these thoughts to
[1:16:03] the people
[1:16:04] in one sense he's telling them that
[1:16:06] these are all the thoughts i have kept
[1:16:09] of you in my mind
[1:16:12] now he's giving it to israel in the form
[1:16:15] of statue and ordinance
[1:16:20] praise the lord
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:24] you see that's the reason why
[1:16:26] legalizing can never survive
[1:16:31] and legalizing
[1:16:33] teaching and attitude to god's word can
[1:16:36] never survive because whenever we come
[1:16:39] to the place to think that we have
[1:16:41] achieved anything
[1:16:43] before god by our might
[1:16:46] you have counted the blood of jesus
[1:16:48] christ
[1:16:50] lesser than your natural breath
[1:17:00] are we together
[1:17:04] so god expressing his thoughts
[1:17:09] and telling it's almost like a father
[1:17:12] telling the child that this was all that
[1:17:15] i taught that
[1:17:17] the day that i have a child this i
[1:17:19] thought of all of this for you i i've
[1:17:22] been thinking you know and all of these
[1:17:24] things are in my mind
[1:17:29] it's not in it's not in a reverse that
[1:17:32] you you know i had this thought in my
[1:17:34] mind but then when you do these things
[1:17:35] then you will become my son no
[1:17:38] [Music]
[1:17:41] no
[1:17:44] praise the lord
[1:17:47] in god's mind his people were going to
[1:17:50] be a peculiar people because he's a
[1:17:52] peculiar god
[1:17:55] the way nobody understand him you will
[1:17:57] never understand the people of god
[1:18:01] you will never understand what it would
[1:18:03] take
[1:18:05] to bring a sinner to christ
[1:18:09] it's now your explanation of the bible
[1:18:12] is not telling him about the message
[1:18:14] what god will do
[1:18:16] to change a man life you will never
[1:18:19] understand it
[1:18:32] praise the lord
[1:18:35] glory be to god
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:41] chapter 26 verse 18.
[1:18:43] let's move faster now amen
[1:18:45] it's just 12 15
[1:18:48] how much how much meaning i have to
[1:18:50] preach
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:55] praise the lord
[1:18:57] you know why i when i preach i like to
[1:18:59] keep people in suspense
[1:19:06] i like to keep you in suspense
[1:19:09] and that's how i gain my time
[1:19:13] let's read verse
[1:19:15] verse 18 here and the lord
[1:19:19] have avoided thee this day to be his
[1:19:22] peculiar people is it that day that he
[1:19:25] decided
[1:19:28] when he said back in in chapter 14 that
[1:19:31] i have chosen you
[1:19:34] now so see the three statement of moses
[1:19:37] is the same man making the three
[1:19:39] statement in exeter he says the lord has
[1:19:43] bare you on the eagle wings if you keep
[1:19:45] the commandments of the lord and obey
[1:19:48] his voice he will make you a peculiar
[1:19:50] people he comes down yet and says god
[1:19:52] has already chosen us to be a peculiar
[1:19:55] people now here again he's saying this
[1:19:58] day if i make you a peculiar people
[1:20:03] praise the lord
[1:20:06] you better leave the message because
[1:20:08] moses is contradicting himself here now
[1:20:11] we can't trust this prophet moses
[1:20:14] he's contradicting this thing he said in
[1:20:16] 1953 in 1965 he said this 1960 says he
[1:20:19] said this
[1:20:21] so we can't trust moses
[1:20:23] [Laughter]
[1:20:25] glory be to god
[1:20:27] amen
[1:20:29] all you have to do is just fall in love
[1:20:31] with jesus
[1:20:33] the word become sweeter
[1:20:36] amen
[1:20:40] praise the lord
[1:20:42] so that we we see that in the old
[1:20:45] testament let's go in the new testament
[1:20:48] titus chapter 2 verse 14
[1:20:52] titus chapter 2 verse 14.
[1:20:56] let's go very quickly we have a few
[1:20:57] things to cover here this morning praise
[1:21:00] the lord
[1:21:01] amen
[1:21:03] hallelujah
[1:21:05] you know wednesday night i was trying to
[1:21:06] catch brother joseph i was just sitting
[1:21:08] there i said lord where is this brother
[1:21:10] going and i mean he was just just
[1:21:12] running like uh all over the place you
[1:21:15] know i was sitting assis
[1:21:18] and i was just i said lord what is this
[1:21:20] brother going you know i said my
[1:21:22] goodness this guy is just
[1:21:24] whether you were pulling him or he was
[1:21:26] running you
[1:21:27] something was happening
[1:21:29] and i sure it was wonderful before the
[1:21:30] lord amen
[1:21:33] praise the lord
[1:21:35] titus chapter 2.
[1:21:44] as we grow together we have the grace to
[1:21:47] be able to appreciate
[1:21:49] one another amen
[1:21:52] tattoos chapter two
[1:21:59] let's look read from verse 13 looking
[1:22:01] for the blessed hope
[1:22:03] and the glorious appearance of the great
[1:22:06] god and our savior jesus christ
[1:22:10] amen
[1:22:13] who gave himself for us
[1:22:16] that he might redeem us
[1:22:20] from all iniquity
[1:22:22] and purify unto himself
[1:22:26] a peculiar
[1:22:28] people
[1:22:30] zealous for good works
[1:22:33] now what i want you to keep in your mind
[1:22:36] here is that titus is a gentile
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:42] title is not a jew
[1:22:44] title is a gentile
[1:22:46] so seeing the grace
[1:22:49] that has come unto the gentile
[1:22:52] titan is processing it
[1:22:54] in the way that he's saying it
[1:22:58] praise the lord
[1:22:59] let's go back and look at that again
[1:23:02] amen
[1:23:05] verse 11 he talks about for the grace of
[1:23:08] god
[1:23:09] their brains salvation has appeared unto
[1:23:13] all men
[1:23:15] what looks like it was hidden before in
[1:23:18] darkness now he's seeing that this grace
[1:23:22] has appeared unto all men
[1:23:24] but i want to do it on verse 14 that's
[1:23:26] where our thought is
[1:23:29] who have given himself for us
[1:23:32] that he might redeem us from our
[1:23:36] iniquity and purify unto himself
[1:23:42] purify unto himself brother branham said
[1:23:45] it this way he said the reason why
[1:23:49] the lord and the ordinance was given to
[1:23:51] the jews was to
[1:23:55] purify a bloodline
[1:23:59] amen
[1:24:00] it was to purify a bloodline that's the
[1:24:03] reason why if a man does something you
[1:24:05] kill him it was to clean the bloodline
[1:24:08] because almighty god was going to travel
[1:24:11] on that bloodline
[1:24:13] to come in flesh
[1:24:17] amen
[1:24:20] so he was going to travel through that
[1:24:22] bloodline that's the reason why right
[1:24:25] from genesis 3 15 the seed of the woman
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:31] the seed of the woman was was was
[1:24:33] prophesied now so you will realize here
[1:24:36] that uh
[1:24:38] if you study you will see that uh there
[1:24:42] there is a place in in history
[1:24:46] we deal with that
[1:24:48] i was just i was just looking at that uh
[1:24:52] i was just looking at that uh
[1:24:55] the other day we we spoke on that year
[1:24:58] uh uh right in in in in jaconi
[1:25:02] you know uh the
[1:25:04] the promise
[1:25:06] of
[1:25:07] of of the redeemer
[1:25:10] amen because the bible speaks about the
[1:25:13] seed of david god promised david that he
[1:25:17] will always have a seed on the throne
[1:25:23] praise the lord
[1:25:25] but when it came to that king because
[1:25:28] he disobeyed the lord
[1:25:30] all of his sons were going to be slain
[1:25:36] so how was david going to have
[1:25:39] a son on the throne
[1:25:42] so by by slaying all of those sons
[1:25:46] means that
[1:25:47] the the the promise to david will have
[1:25:50] stopped right there because he don't
[1:25:52] have a son again to be able to produce a
[1:25:55] sea lion onto so how was god going
[1:25:59] to do that he had to do it by the virgin
[1:26:06] birth so that that is the breach
[1:26:12] the virgin birth breach
[1:26:15] the the the old testament promise
[1:26:19] that is the bridge where the virgin
[1:26:22] breath took the physical sea line
[1:26:25] into a spiritual sea line
[1:26:30] because the physical sea lion was being
[1:26:33] produced by blood
[1:26:35] one seed onto another
[1:26:38] one seed onto another
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:43] from from adam came noah and noah
[1:26:45] through the floor came abraham and
[1:26:48] abraham became the patriots out of the
[1:26:50] patriot came david so it was a natural
[1:26:53] sea lion but when it came to that place
[1:26:57] a breach
[1:26:58] a cross from a natural sea lion to a
[1:27:01] spiritual sea lion
[1:27:04] it is only through the virgin birth that
[1:27:07] god will be able to achieve that
[1:27:11] are we together
[1:27:12] amen so let's let's continue with this
[1:27:15] now uh so we see here that uh israel
[1:27:19] was a peculiar treasure
[1:27:23] over and over the law said said it unto
[1:27:25] them
[1:27:26] they were a peculiar treasure
[1:27:29] and and and uh this this uh uh uh
[1:27:33] peculiarness or uh or that they hire
[1:27:36] with god
[1:27:37] never came
[1:27:40] from what they did
[1:27:43] praise the lord
[1:27:45] amen
[1:27:46] god made them a peculiar people
[1:27:50] to go through the things
[1:27:52] that they went through
[1:27:54] because they were designed to be able to
[1:27:58] produce a bloodline
[1:28:03] praise the lord
[1:28:06] that's the reason why a man could not be
[1:28:09] a priest you have to be of the trap of
[1:28:11] levi you have to be of the sons of aaron
[1:28:14] i mean it was just everything by the
[1:28:16] blood
[1:28:20] he was keeping that bloodline
[1:28:25] praise the lord
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:28] now
[1:28:31] but unto the gentiles
[1:28:33] the gentiles
[1:28:36] became peculiar people
[1:28:39] of a peculiar treasure also unto god
[1:28:43] why because the gentiles were designed
[1:28:46] just like titus said here who has given
[1:28:49] himself for us that he might redeem us
[1:28:52] from our iniquity and purify unto
[1:28:56] himself
[1:28:57] purify unto himself so that gentiles
[1:29:00] were were
[1:29:02] were designed that god will produce
[1:29:05] himself a bride
[1:29:08] amen
[1:29:09] the jews were designed that god will
[1:29:13] become flesh
[1:29:15] the gentiles were designed that god
[1:29:18] would produce himself so we right back
[1:29:20] to genesis 1 26 says
[1:29:23] when god said let us make man in our
[1:29:27] image the bible says male and female
[1:29:31] created hidden
[1:29:33] so the image of god that was expressed
[1:29:36] in genesis 1 26 was male and female
[1:29:40] so god himself now genesis
[1:29:43] 1 20 says god was creating but this time
[1:29:47] god is not creating amen
[1:29:49] praise the lord
[1:29:51] hallelujah
[1:29:52] god is becoming
[1:29:56] he's not creating he became a man and
[1:30:00] he's becoming a bride
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:04] god is becoming amen
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:11] oh my goodness me
[1:30:14] [Applause]
[1:30:15] god is becoming you
[1:30:19] he's becoming you
[1:30:22] he's becoming
[1:30:25] that's why you have to take your hands
[1:30:26] off it
[1:30:28] you have to take your hands off it
[1:30:30] because this is god becoming
[1:30:39] my goodness
[1:30:41] hallelujah
[1:30:46] god is becoming
[1:30:50] just like he created in the beginning
[1:30:53] amen
[1:30:55] the bible said he made man
[1:30:57] in his image
[1:31:00] praise the lord
[1:31:01] so he create a body
[1:31:06] that he could tabernacle in
[1:31:10] amen
[1:31:11] but this one he's not creating a body
[1:31:14] he's becoming
[1:31:16] from the inside
[1:31:18] from the sea incorruptible
[1:31:21] which is the word of god
[1:31:23] that we have received by faith
[1:31:26] god is becoming
[1:31:36] my goodness
[1:31:38] praise the lord
[1:31:40] hallelujah
[1:31:44] that's the reason why god's people are
[1:31:46] peculiar
[1:31:50] they are peculiar
[1:31:55] because he's a peculiar god now brother
[1:31:57] branham said this that's what we want we
[1:32:00] want to drop
[1:32:02] thank you
[1:32:06] thank you
[1:32:08] amen
[1:32:14] hallelujah
[1:32:16] praise the lord
[1:32:18] amen spoken word is the original sea
[1:32:20] brother branham brought this talk to us
[1:32:23] that's that is where he used this phrase
[1:32:25] super race
[1:32:27] and and and
[1:32:29] and sometimes
[1:32:30] we follow the letters
[1:32:32] amen
[1:32:34] we think that is is some kind of a
[1:32:38] thing that is f bound or is f associated
[1:32:43] because we are in the message no
[1:32:45] no
[1:32:46] let's look into the super race a little
[1:32:48] bit
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:51] because you see you have to be careful
[1:32:54] you have to be careful
[1:32:56] we are in we are in a world that is very
[1:33:00] sensitive to racial statement
[1:33:04] so you have to know what god is
[1:33:06] expressing you
[1:33:08] what was the prophet saying
[1:33:13] now so brother branham's spoken word is
[1:33:15] the original seed the lord of
[1:33:17] reproduction
[1:33:20] brings fault of a kind genesis uh uh uh
[1:33:24] 111

[1:33:59] you know it's a statement to make people
[1:34:02] radical
[1:34:04] amen
[1:34:05] behind the curtain of time brother brahm
[1:34:07] says when he break for there and he saw
[1:34:09] all of those people coming and and and
[1:34:12] and he says are the are these branham
[1:34:13] eyes the angels of the lord told him no

[1:35:10] in order to be united with him his image
[1:35:14] is not physical appearance

[1:35:21] his image is the word it's not physical
[1:35:24] appearance
[1:35:28] it's not affluent nationality that we
[1:35:31] all have to become americans to become

[1:36:02] are one
[1:36:04] there will be the very manifestation
[1:36:09] of the word of the living god
[1:36:13] and he says denomination
[1:36:17] outside the message
[1:36:18] denomination in the message
[1:36:22] can never produce this

[1:36:59] but uh let's uh let's let's let's take a
[1:37:02] a little tour here and see some few
[1:37:04] things that the prophet god said lean
[1:37:06] that on to your own understanding he
[1:37:08] said now notice the churches of today do
[1:37:11] the same thing
[1:37:13] they have formed a great super race of
[1:37:16] understanding
[1:37:18] and sometimes
[1:37:20] we we come to be guilty of that
[1:37:24] praise the lord
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:28] we have to realize that this prophet of
[1:37:31] god said i have never changed one thing
[1:37:36] i have believed
[1:37:38] he says but over the years i have
[1:37:40] progressed
[1:37:41] yes
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:45] that's growth
[1:37:47] that's the statue of the perfect man
[1:37:50] if a man is being built in the statue of
[1:37:53] the peppermint he will grow
[1:37:56] in his level of understanding
[1:38:03] yes
[1:38:06] they have formed a great super race of
[1:38:08] honesty in their denominational system
[1:38:12] praise the lord
[1:38:14] they are people that will see it right
[1:38:15] in the world they will see you right in
[1:38:17] the message but that's their doctrine
[1:38:21] super race of understanding because
[1:38:23] that's what make them who they are
[1:38:28] you can preach this message better than
[1:38:30] the messenger
[1:38:36] praise the lord
[1:38:45] are we together
[1:38:51] oh my
[1:38:56] god view of super science coach
[1:38:58] different series different super science

[1:39:03] must be super
[1:39:05] we used to have
[1:39:08] the old highway
[1:39:10] we used to travel now they have got
[1:39:13] super highways
[1:39:14] has got to be four or five lanes going
[1:39:17] one way four five lanes coming the other
[1:39:21] or you get run over
[1:39:25] praise the lord
[1:39:27] you have uh
[1:39:29] you have to have it cause this is the
[1:39:32] super age super time everything in it is
[1:39:35] super
[1:39:37] we even think
[1:39:39] we got super people
[1:39:41] amen
[1:39:42] some people think they are super
[1:39:44] they are going to make it in in the
[1:39:46] bride they're going to be raptured they
[1:39:47] can live any kind of a life
[1:39:50] they believe the prophet
[1:39:54] so they are super they are above the
[1:39:55] word of god
[1:39:58] we are super people some some people
[1:40:00] think they are super and they try to act
[1:40:03] like that anyhow
[1:40:05] super race
[1:40:07] one
[1:40:08] one race
[1:40:10] wanting to rule over the other
[1:40:13] water by race or whether by tribe
[1:40:16] or whether by church
[1:40:20] super churches super denomination
[1:40:22] everything coming
[1:40:24] to super
[1:40:26] amen
[1:40:27] but man says here also he says
[1:40:31] the one super race he says remember
[1:40:33] hitler said
[1:40:35] the german were super race
[1:40:38] he said scotland taught russia was super
[1:40:41] race
[1:40:43] amen
[1:40:47] and
[1:40:49] and we know
[1:40:50] when we go back to the holocaust
[1:40:54] we know
[1:40:56] what happened
[1:40:58] amen
[1:41:00] history tells us what happened
[1:41:02] is is strange that
[1:41:04] we don't learn from history
[1:41:09] praise the lord
[1:41:11] it's a strange thing that we don't learn
[1:41:13] from history
[1:41:15] glory be to god
[1:41:17] you see the same thing going on there in
[1:41:19] in europe
[1:41:21] and the whole world is sitting down
[1:41:22] watching television
[1:41:25] amen
[1:41:29] what is assad think england said as long
[1:41:34] as
[1:41:35] there's a word there will be an england
[1:41:38] super race
[1:41:39] america think they are the super race
[1:41:42] they got
[1:41:43] their intelligence in everything that's
[1:41:46] all we need
[1:41:47] so we are the super race now so you see
[1:41:50] as brother branham brings this thought
[1:41:53] as he brings this thought you realize
[1:41:56] the other
[1:41:57] his statement in in spoken word is the
[1:42:00] original seed
[1:42:02] was not an ethnic group
[1:42:06] he was not talking about a super race
[1:42:10] into says that you know
[1:42:13] we are building something you know uh uh
[1:42:16] uh that that uh that that is built by
[1:42:19] man
[1:42:20] i mean
[1:42:22] like uh i mean uh like like the latter
[1:42:25] day this and does you know the the they
[1:42:27] just think that uh that entire movement
[1:42:30] uh you know this there's a special race
[1:42:32] of people you know that that uh that god
[1:42:35] called in that movement from joseph
[1:42:36] smith in in in and and in the way they
[1:42:39] try to do it you have to wear your white
[1:42:41] shirt and your black tie your black
[1:42:42] trousers i mean you got to get a special
[1:42:44] dress code to be part of that
[1:42:51] praise the lord
[1:42:56] barbara goes on with the same line of
[1:42:58] thought
[1:43:00] hitler tried to make a super race he
[1:43:03] said pharaoh
[1:43:04] tried to make a super race
[1:43:07] as two in
[1:43:08] egypt to try to
[1:43:11] and you see that's that is the top that
[1:43:13] is that is in the minds of more
[1:43:15] detectors around the world
[1:43:18] praise the lord
[1:43:20] and they use there to destroy their
[1:43:22] people
[1:43:25] why they try to use that very same
[1:43:27] thought to enslave the other people that
[1:43:29] is around them
[1:43:36] the throne where pharaoh said you can
[1:43:38] dig 20 feet beneath the earth to find
[1:43:41] their throne i have stood in rome
[1:43:44] where caesar
[1:43:48] and can't even find a place unless you
[1:43:50] dig
[1:43:51] way down
[1:43:52] praise the lord so he's bringing the
[1:43:55] talk that all of these men that have
[1:43:57] tried to bail
[1:43:59] one group of people when the bible says
[1:44:02] by one blood
[1:44:03] god made all men every man that have
[1:44:07] tried to set one group of people aside
[1:44:12] to make them a super race over
[1:44:15] the rest of humanity has all come to
[1:44:18] arches
[1:44:21] praise the lord
[1:44:23] amen
[1:44:25] so if we follow that line of talk
[1:44:28] we will understand that brother branham
[1:44:31] was not doing nothing naturally that the
[1:44:33] people that come and believe the message
[1:44:35] baptized in jesus name believe william
[1:44:37] branham is a prophet now you are a super
[1:44:39] race no that's not what he was saying
[1:44:47] praise the lord
[1:44:48] that's not what he was saying now as as
[1:44:51] we stated along we go ahead you will
[1:44:52] realize that brother branham was he was
[1:44:56] uh i'll read that to you he was he was
[1:44:59] dwelling on the same thought
[1:45:02] of god's peculiar people
[1:45:07] because god's people are peculiar
[1:45:10] and god has made a promise
[1:45:13] that he will have a people he will have
[1:45:17] a bride
[1:45:18] no matter what the world becomes no
[1:45:20] matter how cold the church becomes no
[1:45:23] matter how dead the people becomes
[1:45:26] how how much they fill the internet with
[1:45:28] everything against the message and the
[1:45:30] messenger god has sealed his own life
[1:45:33] that he will have a people without spot
[1:45:36] or wrinkle
[1:45:38] amen
[1:45:40] praise the lord
[1:45:42] the talk behind it is that
[1:45:45] the way that you will overcome this age
[1:45:49] it will have to be
[1:45:51] a super grace
[1:45:54] that will give you super faith
[1:45:57] and we'll produce a super result
[1:46:00] even if you don't believe it but because
[1:46:03] god has said it
[1:46:06] that is the thought that is behind it
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:10] praise the lord
[1:46:13] hallelujah
[1:46:14] oh you can look at all of your struggle
[1:46:16] and the thing your body goes through you
[1:46:18] know you associate it with your past and
[1:46:21] it haunts you all the time how am i
[1:46:23] going to get over this but if god have
[1:46:25] said you are going to be your bride amen
[1:46:28] praise the lord all you have to do just
[1:46:30] look to see your name in the land book
[1:46:32] of life how god will make you to
[1:46:34] overcome it
[1:46:36] it's going to be a release brother
[1:46:38] branham called it a supreme
[1:46:40] fate in the supreme hour
[1:46:45] that's the thought he was carrying
[1:46:50] he was not starting a cut or a movement
[1:46:55] well we just become supreme i mean we
[1:46:57] become super race because you know we
[1:47:00] we're having the pillow of fire picture
[1:47:02] in our home you know so it makes us
[1:47:04] that's the way we become super race
[1:47:10] praise the lord
[1:47:12] it's appreciating
[1:47:14] what god has done in our age
[1:47:17] amen
[1:47:19] it's appreciating
[1:47:20] it but we're not using it as a ticket
[1:47:24] lord i have your prophet picture
[1:47:28] it's not a ticket
[1:47:34] glory be to god
[1:47:37] glory be to god
[1:47:40] verbum says another uh a super saiyan
[1:47:42] series he says they tell me
[1:47:45] they got a soup they got a television
[1:47:49] a television cast they called superman
[1:47:53] and then when i when i read that i went
[1:47:56] back in and realized that superman was
[1:47:58] published
[1:48:00] april 18 1938
[1:48:06] praise the lord so way back
[1:48:10] amen
[1:48:12] and there are many men that have played
[1:48:13] superman to die and another person
[1:48:15] played superman again
[1:48:17] all the supermen ain't dying
[1:48:19] or they get old
[1:48:21] praise the lord but i'm telling you this
[1:48:24] super race i'm talking about
[1:48:27] death is not our portion
[1:48:32] [Laughter]
[1:48:37] amen
[1:48:39] glory be to god
[1:48:41] hallelujah
[1:48:44] amen we're just trying to lay some some
[1:48:46] foundation down yet amen
[1:48:48] praise the lord
[1:48:50] if if i left for five minutes i would
[1:48:51] stay try to nail everything in five
[1:48:54] minutes i don't know how i'm going to do
[1:48:55] it
[1:48:56] praise the lord
[1:48:58] so you see
[1:49:00] you go back
[1:49:03] and and and you realize
[1:49:06] that brother branham did not stand alone
[1:49:10] in this line of thought let's look at
[1:49:12] the apostle paul
[1:49:14] praise the lord
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:17] there are few scriptures i want for us
[1:49:19] to look at quickly first timothy chapter
[1:49:21] 1 verse 14
[1:49:23] praise the lord
[1:49:25] first timothy 1 14
[1:49:27] they are speaking
[1:49:29] about
[1:49:32] grace exceeding and abundant
[1:49:37] grace exceeding he says and the grace of
[1:49:40] our lord was exceedingly
[1:49:43] abundant
[1:49:46] abundant with faith
[1:49:49] now if you if you study that
[1:49:52] you realize that it comes from a greek
[1:49:55] prefix
[1:49:58] because what you have to understand that
[1:50:00] the new testament
[1:50:02] was originally written in the greek
[1:50:06] yes
[1:50:07] praise the lord and whenever you have
[1:50:10] translation
[1:50:12] sometimes it losses
[1:50:16] amen
[1:50:17] i was talking with a young brother and
[1:50:19] we were driving and he asked me he says
[1:50:21] he says he says brother one i was
[1:50:22] reading the scripture and the bible said
[1:50:24] jesus says
[1:50:26] i will send you another comforter
[1:50:30] amen
[1:50:32] so i asked him what what do you think
[1:50:34] about that he says it sounds like to me
[1:50:36] there is one comforter and there is
[1:50:38] another comforter
[1:50:40] because jesus says i will send you
[1:50:41] another comforter
[1:50:44] praise lord
[1:50:45] and and and and that is the way you
[1:50:47] might understand it when you take it in
[1:50:50] the english land of talk
[1:50:53] you can only have another when you
[1:50:55] already have one
[1:50:58] praise the lord
[1:51:00] but you see jesus is trying to
[1:51:04] bring express his thoughts to his
[1:51:06] disciple
[1:51:08] i will never leave you comfortless
[1:51:10] i will be with you
[1:51:13] amen that's what he's trying to tell
[1:51:15] them
[1:51:16] another comforter means i will send you
[1:51:19] the comforter it's another way that i
[1:51:21] will be with you
[1:51:24] amen
[1:51:25] amen
[1:51:28] amen the comforter is another way
[1:51:32] it's another manifestation of myself
[1:51:38] so you see just like uh uh uh paul is
[1:51:42] saying here
[1:51:43] and
[1:51:44] uh this this uh uh uh uh exceeding
[1:51:48] abundant if you look at it in a great
[1:51:51] preface it means
[1:51:53] hopper
[1:51:54] super
[1:51:56] it carried a sense
[1:51:59] of super
[1:52:02] so this grace that is coming on to you
[1:52:06] is a super grace
[1:52:10] that we
[1:52:11] that were that that that it looks like
[1:52:14] we were never counted
[1:52:16] in the economy of god
[1:52:20] amen
[1:52:22] that grace has come to us
[1:52:26] grace has come to us so much
[1:52:29] that we understand the ordinance that
[1:52:32] the jews had
[1:52:34] more than they did
[1:52:37] because they are holding to the literal
[1:52:39] the literal
[1:52:41] uh uh uh
[1:52:42] ordinance and stature
[1:52:44] but grace has come to you and myself
[1:52:49] that we know that everything that was
[1:52:52] given to them everything that was given
[1:52:54] to them
[1:52:57] do you realize that
[1:52:59] in the in in the old testament
[1:53:02] uh uh uh
[1:53:04] uh
[1:53:06] do you realize that blood
[1:53:09] represent savor
[1:53:12] that's where the thought saver
[1:53:14] represents redemption
[1:53:16] that's where the thought is from
[1:53:19] everything in the old testament
[1:53:21] tabernacle was sitting in a silver
[1:53:24] plate everything
[1:53:27] the altar rested on a silver plate the
[1:53:30] basin rested on a silver plate so
[1:53:33] everything they had in the tabernacle
[1:53:37] was speaking of blood
[1:53:42] everything
[1:53:47] everything they had in the old testament
[1:53:49] tabernacle
[1:53:51] was pointing
[1:53:55] to the to the crucification of our lord
[1:53:57] jesus
[1:54:00] even in the old testament tabernacle
[1:54:02] they had their redemption money
[1:54:06] their redemption money was a silver
[1:54:08] queen
[1:54:12] now every first bomb belongs to the lord
[1:54:15] but if a man never wanted his son to be
[1:54:18] given to the tabernacle he takes the
[1:54:20] redemption queen and then he comes and
[1:54:23] gave it to the priests in the change of
[1:54:25] his son
[1:54:27] everything that was used
[1:54:30] in the tabernacle
[1:54:32] rested
[1:54:34] on blood
[1:54:38] that's what moses said he said i mean uh
[1:54:41] paul said in hebrew he said all the
[1:54:44] instruments
[1:54:45] the priests will dip the house up in the
[1:54:48] blood and spring it on all the
[1:54:50] instrument
[1:54:51] that there is there is there will not be
[1:54:53] one thing
[1:54:54] in the tabernacle that would go without
[1:54:57] blood
[1:55:01] now can you imagine that all of those uh
[1:55:04] high priests
[1:55:05] people that have to wash their skin and
[1:55:08] make sure no no kind of a strange they
[1:55:10] gotta take back they got to dress a
[1:55:11] certain way look at their clothes those
[1:55:13] things only everything in the way that
[1:55:15] they were trying to to
[1:55:18] live out the holiness the sacredness of
[1:55:21] god
[1:55:22] but they were holding all of those
[1:55:24] things
[1:55:25] without even understanding
[1:55:30] without even understanding
[1:55:33] that's the reason why the jews cannot
[1:55:35] bring worship to god even now
[1:55:38] even now why because they don't have a
[1:55:40] temple
[1:55:42] they cannot make sacrifice
[1:55:44] until the temple is rebuilt
[1:55:48] and they can get a rare huffle back into
[1:55:51] the temple
[1:55:54] that's the reason why that war is called
[1:55:56] the willing wall they go there and cry
[1:55:59] they go to the ward and he stands there
[1:56:01] and say the god of abraham asking jacob
[1:56:03] oh the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[1:56:06] it's a willing war they just go and cry
[1:56:08] to god they cannot bring worship to god
[1:56:15] then you have a bunch of gentiles
[1:56:18] that you appreciate the grace of god
[1:56:20] want to become jews
[1:56:23] they want to become jews to become
[1:56:25] children of abraham
[1:56:27] when when the royal seed has come
[1:56:30] through the blood of jesus christ that
[1:56:32] was sacrificed for you and myself
[1:56:42] lord be to god
[1:56:44] hallelujah
[1:56:47] are we together
[1:56:49] now so paul here is speaking about
[1:56:52] a super grace and a seeding
[1:56:55] abundant grace
[1:56:57] that have come to you and myself
[1:57:01] that's the reason why
[1:57:03] don't don't don't don't don't play with
[1:57:05] the grace of god
[1:57:07] don't play with it
[1:57:11] if you have ever experienced what the
[1:57:13] grace of god is
[1:57:15] let's take another verse here and see
[1:57:17] and see the same expression in your
[1:57:18] second testimony one three
[1:57:21] second testimony and one 1-3
[1:57:26] now i'm trying to show you that the very
[1:57:30] same thing that bro brandon preach
[1:57:32] poor also had the same taught
[1:57:39] praise the lord
[1:57:46] when brother brown said he preached whop
[1:57:48] what paul preached
[1:57:50] they didn't use the same language he did
[1:57:52] not call that paul over and over but the
[1:57:54] holy spirit is driving the same thought
[1:57:57] home
[1:58:01] second testimony in verse chapter 1
[1:58:04] verse three
[1:58:07] you see paul used the same thing
[1:58:09] we are about we we are bound to thank
[1:58:12] god always for you
[1:58:14] brethren ask it is me because
[1:58:18] that your faith groweth exceedingly
[1:58:23] so you are growing onto a super faith
[1:58:28] amen
[1:58:30] you are growing onto a super faith
[1:58:34] you are growing to the faith that in
[1:58:37] your heart to walk with god
[1:58:39] your faith is not only captured in
[1:58:42] material things money and housing and
[1:58:44] things around you you are growing into a
[1:58:47] super faith
[1:58:48] now whether you have it or not you still
[1:58:50] believe god you believe that god is in
[1:58:53] control
[1:58:54] your faith does not depend on
[1:58:57] what you have
[1:58:58] this is this is not a casino
[1:59:04] that's why you're telling them you are
[1:59:06] growing we have to thank god for you
[1:59:08] because we see you grow into a super
[1:59:10] fight
[1:59:12] and he's telling the church he's telling
[1:59:14] the testimonial church at that time
[1:59:16] because the church was going through
[1:59:18] persecution
[1:59:20] that's when your faith comes
[1:59:22] it's not when you have everything
[1:59:24] the church was going through persecution
[1:59:27] the thessalonica church was being
[1:59:29] persecuted
[1:59:30] and paul is telling him we can see
[1:59:33] that you are growing to super fate
[1:59:36] that even though they are imprisoning
[1:59:38] you but you are not backing down you are
[1:59:40] still calling to what you believe
[1:59:42] that's what we're talking about
[1:59:46] that's what the super race would do now
[1:59:49] people that would try to find a way out
[1:59:52] when bethlehem talks about a super race
[1:59:54] that's what that super race will do
[1:59:56] and people that will trust god
[1:59:59] even when
[2:00:00] when they
[2:00:01] they don't trust god just to look for an
[2:00:03] answer they trust god because they
[2:00:04] believe god exists
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:11] just to have an answer hallelujah amen
[2:00:14] that's what he's talking about
[2:00:17] that is the characteristics of the super
[2:00:19] race
[2:00:21] now your ego bill barker
[2:00:27] let's take another one here
[2:00:30] uh ephesians chapter one
[2:00:32] ephesians 119
[2:00:35] four should should be enough for us
[2:00:37] we'll take that one and we take one more
[2:00:40] praise the lord
[2:00:43] and we get back to the prophet yeah i'll
[2:00:45] try to close here soon amen
[2:00:52] ephesians 119 brother paul says here he
[2:00:55] says
[2:00:57] and what is the exceeding greatness
[2:01:02] of his power to us wall
[2:01:05] amen
[2:01:07] praise the lord
[2:01:08] i think uh
[2:01:11] when i read this i wanted to drop back a
[2:01:13] little bit so let me get there and uh
[2:01:16] and see
[2:01:18] praise the lord
[2:01:21] just want to draw back a little bit
[2:01:22] there
[2:01:23] so it's efficient one
[2:01:28] glory be to god
[2:01:47] okay let's let's read from
[2:01:51] from verse 17 that the god
[2:01:54] of our lord jesus christ the father of
[2:01:56] glory may give unto you the spirit of
[2:02:00] wisdom
[2:02:01] in revelation
[2:02:03] in the knowledge of him
[2:02:05] the eyes
[2:02:07] of your understanding
[2:02:09] being enlightened
[2:02:11] that ye may know what is the hope
[2:02:14] of his calling
[2:02:17] and what the riches of the glory of his
[2:02:21] inheritance in the saints
[2:02:24] mayan man that's that just that just
[2:02:26] such an expression
[2:02:28] it is enough for us to spend the rest of
[2:02:31] the year on this subject
[2:02:33] amen
[2:02:34] don't even try me and i can i can still
[2:02:36] write on this verse
[2:02:39] praise the lord
[2:02:41] amen
[2:02:42] paul is talking here you know that uh
[2:02:45] that uh uh that that we
[2:02:48] and may give you uh the spirit of wisdom
[2:02:52] and the revelation
[2:02:55] in the knowledge of him
[2:02:57] praise the lord the revelation in the
[2:03:00] knowledge of him that the eyes of your
[2:03:03] understanding might be enlightened
[2:03:06] that ye may know what is the hope of his
[2:03:10] calling
[2:03:11] praise the lord if god have called you
[2:03:14] there is hope in his calling
[2:03:17] praise the lord
[2:03:18] he have caught us for a purpose
[2:03:22] everything can be falling apart around
[2:03:24] you
[2:03:24] you can hold to that hope
[2:03:28] paul speaks of the same thing there in
[2:03:30] romans he says
[2:03:31] abraham against hope
[2:03:33] he believed in hope
[2:03:36] when he looks like everything was became
[2:03:38] becoming hopeless
[2:03:39] he was still hopeful
[2:03:41] that the god that have caught him
[2:03:45] is more than able to produce a son
[2:03:48] when everything was becoming hopeless
[2:03:51] he's becoming old sarah is i i i
[2:03:54] mentioned she she had passed out that
[2:03:56] the age everything was becoming hopeless
[2:03:59] but he never lost hope
[2:04:03] praise the lord
[2:04:05] he never lost hope
[2:04:07] against hope he believed in hope
[2:04:11] you see so you have to study that
[2:04:13] scripture
[2:04:15] that's where you will see where brother
[2:04:17] branham met when he said
[2:04:19] he he speaks of
[2:04:21] hope is the enemy to faith
[2:04:24] but there is a hope that is also a
[2:04:26] support to faith
[2:04:30] so you got to release one and hold to
[2:04:33] one
[2:04:35] oh my goodness

[2:04:46] his power
[2:04:48] so yeah he's speaking about a superpower
[2:04:52] he's telling the church
[2:04:54] telling the efficient church that in
[2:04:57] your calling the hope of your calling
[2:05:00] the glory of the inheritance

[2:05:52] to believe him

[2:05:57] it's not your church membership
[2:06:01] it's the inheritance of the father
[2:06:06] is is god's investment
[2:06:10] praise the lord

[2:06:27] also talking about a superpower
[2:06:31] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[2:06:33] us war
[2:06:36] that's what brother branham said if you
[2:06:38] want to know
[2:06:39] where the mises are flying he says see
[2:06:42] how the church is praying
[2:06:45] he said god has placed the greatest
[2:06:48] where you want to talk about superpower

[2:07:31] just ignoring this
[2:07:32] that there is a superpower to me
[2:07:37] means that
[2:07:38] no devil can play with me
[2:07:42] no devil in here

[2:07:50] they can only stay across the fence and
[2:07:52] be throwing things they can't come near
[2:07:56] they can stay over the fence and be
[2:07:58] throwing things
[2:08:01] because they can they can sense and and
[2:08:03] i mean if if you are in contact you can
[2:08:05] sense the presence that is around you
[2:08:07] [Music]
[2:08:12] let's take the last one
[2:08:13] that's romans chapter eight
[2:08:18] it's a familiar one that we know eight
[2:08:20] verse thirty
[2:08:21] we are more than conquerors
[2:08:24] that word more
[2:08:26] also goes with the same
[2:08:29] because you are not a conqueror
[2:08:32] you are not a conqueror
[2:08:35] but you are more than a conqueror
[2:08:40] you are not a conqueror because you
[2:08:42] don't have to fight
[2:08:47] amen
[2:08:49] it's the ones that fight that conquest
[2:08:52] but you are not a conqueror
[2:08:54] your position
[2:08:57] [Laughter]
[2:08:58] your position
[2:09:00] is for you to rejoice in the victory
[2:09:03] your position is for you
[2:09:06] to benefit
[2:09:08] from what has been conquered
[2:09:12] [Music]
[2:09:13] so don't complain to me
[2:09:15] don't complain to me because you are
[2:09:17] more than a conqueror you have super
[2:09:19] power backing you up you are growing in
[2:09:21] a super faith
[2:09:25] then what are we crying about
[2:09:27] this church must be on our toes
[2:09:30] praise the lord we must be exercising
[2:09:32] our muscle and speaking and believing
[2:09:35] that god will bring it to pass
[2:09:37] [Applause]
[2:09:43] see why brother branham share
[2:09:45] let's find this thing
[2:09:47] amen
[2:09:49] oh my god speak speak to this mountain
[2:09:52] brother branham says
[2:09:53] talking
[2:09:56] he says
[2:09:58] he says talking on vision that's that's
[2:10:00] not what i want to go to but let's start
[2:10:02] with this he says talking talking about
[2:10:04] vision i told him he was he was talking
[2:10:06] about brother ben uh brother ben rules
[2:10:08] and his wife he says i told them what
[2:10:10] happened
[2:10:12] now like it
[2:10:14] it has to
[2:10:16] have something
[2:10:18] the only thing i know
[2:10:21] if it ever happened like that
[2:10:25] it will be a faith that god
[2:10:30] will have to give me
[2:10:33] because when that anointing comes on me
[2:10:39] just seem like a super faith
[2:10:43] praise the lord
[2:10:46] i said i said
[2:10:52] rises up in me that fit rises up in me
[2:10:55] some think
[2:10:57] that there's not a shadow of doubt it's
[2:11:01] not a guesswork
[2:11:04] it's not a guesswork
[2:11:07] not a shadow of
[2:11:08] that i said oh
[2:11:11] how i trust
[2:11:13] just like
[2:11:14] i have been having visions when the lord
[2:11:17] will tell me in a vision go do accepting
[2:11:21] thing
[2:11:22] why mine there there will be no question
[2:11:26] in my mind you see that's the reason why
[2:11:28] god even had to rebuild brother branham
[2:11:31] why why why why cry unto me you know uh
[2:11:34] uh as i was with moses that's what he
[2:11:36] said god had to rebuke him because he
[2:11:39] has lived this way very long to rely on
[2:11:42] vision because he knew that those
[2:11:44] visions never fail
[2:11:46] amen but god wanted him to step beyond
[2:11:50] vision that's the same way god wants you
[2:11:52] to step in the word beyond what the
[2:11:55] pastor says
[2:11:56] you have to step in the word be a son of
[2:11:59] god be a daughter of god take position
[2:12:01] for the word
[2:12:08] amen
[2:12:11] there will be no question in my mind
[2:12:13] just go do it never fail
[2:12:16] so it just got to happen
[2:12:19] so you have got to believe
[2:12:22] that what you are doing

[2:22:40] that's all the acts of faith tomorrow i
[2:22:43] will meet you at a setting place
[2:22:46] that's all the act of faith
[2:22:49] because you have just done it so much
[2:22:54] because it's a regular routine with you
[2:22:58] that's the way
[2:23:00] the things of god
[2:23:02] are
[2:23:04] that's the way the things of god are
[2:23:07] when people try to make it over special
[2:23:11] there must be no difference between
[2:23:13] wednesday night service and sunday
[2:23:15] morning service
[2:23:17] amen there is nothing that mess on the
[2:23:19] divine and wednesday is not divine
[2:23:25] praise the lord
[2:23:27] even if a person is not able to make it
[2:23:29] a church and they are home the same
[2:23:31] sacredness the same reverence and it
[2:23:34] must be there
[2:23:37] this thing must not be able to cut your
[2:23:39] reverence to the word
[2:23:42] it must not change your attitude
[2:23:52] praise the lord
[2:23:54] i mean not not not following service in
[2:23:56] pyjamas and and drinking coffee and
[2:23:59] eating sandwiches preach brother preach
[2:24:06] that was a good one
[2:24:12] you're saying glory to that sandwich
[2:24:25] because it's a routine
[2:24:27] that's the way the things of god are
[2:24:29] after you have trusted him and watched
[2:24:32] him do it so much so many times
[2:24:35] till it become just a
[2:24:38] regular routine
[2:24:41] you have trusted god when you leave in
[2:24:43] your house to watch over you
[2:24:47] you have trusted god that you will go
[2:24:49] out and come back
[2:24:53] it has become a regular routine you have
[2:24:56] trusted god he has brought you out of
[2:24:59] difficult trouble there is not one that
[2:25:01] is now that he will not bring you out of
[2:25:10] complaining only weakens fate
[2:25:13] you're just weakening brother branham
[2:25:14] said unbelievable only handle the
[2:25:16] unbeliever it will never stop god from
[2:25:18] what he's doing
[2:25:20] it's not because it's not happening in
[2:25:22] your life it means that it's not
[2:25:23] happening
[2:25:34] and that's the condition i think the
[2:25:36] church will be in

[2:33:50] it might be a very simple way in your
[2:33:52] life
[2:33:54] it might be the very menu thing
[2:33:56] that god is doing

[2:34:03] helping you in your prayer life
[2:34:05] [Music]
[2:34:08] helping you in your personal devotion
[2:34:11] no matter what it is i believe the bride

[2:34:15] to that place
[2:34:16] of supreme faith
[2:34:27] you have to just
[2:34:31] think this morning
[2:34:36] if you can just take a pause in your
[2:34:38] mind
[2:34:40] and just
[2:34:41] look for what the lord has stepped you
[2:34:44] up this week
[2:34:46] something that he did
[2:34:50] something that he did
[2:34:52] it can be the simplest thing
[2:34:56] something that god did
[2:34:58] that make you
[2:35:00] to trust him the most
[2:35:03] it don't have to be a miracle
[2:35:10] he's doing these things in our inner
[2:35:12] routine of our life
[2:35:14] because we do it over and over and over
[2:35:18] we don't seem to pay attention
[2:35:21] we are looking for a blast that will
[2:35:23] come from heaven
[2:35:26] but god is working in our daily routine
[2:35:31] when we wake up in the morning
[2:35:34] all the things that we do brush our
[2:35:36] teeth take a shower
[2:35:39] sometimes you are brushing your teeth
[2:35:41] and the thought comes to your mind and
[2:35:43] god will remind you about something
[2:35:45] sometimes you are right under the shower
[2:35:47] a flash of thought would come to your
[2:35:49] mind a scripture that you were reading
[2:35:51] or something that you listened to from
[2:35:53] the prophet or in the service
[2:35:56] god is in the routine of our lives
[2:36:00] that's why we have to pay attention
[2:36:02] in the simplest thing of our life you
[2:36:05] could be having breakfast
[2:36:08] you could buy your hairs to pray you are
[2:36:10] just praying over the meal
[2:36:14] and you say lord just remember those
[2:36:16] that don't even have food to eat
