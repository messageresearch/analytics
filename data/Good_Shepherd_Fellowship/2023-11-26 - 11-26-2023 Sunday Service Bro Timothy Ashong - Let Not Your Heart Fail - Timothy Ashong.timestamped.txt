[53:00] to thank just like I said yesterday we
[53:02] want to thank the family as well for
[53:05] working with
[53:06] us
[53:08] uh because you know uh uh I I always
[53:13] believe this there uh you know that's my
[53:16] personal stand when it comes
[53:19] to marriages and and uh wedding and
[53:24] funeral
[53:25] those things are family
[53:27] things I don't believe that the church
[53:30] has any sovereignty to tell the person
[53:33] how to do their wedding and how to do
[53:36] their funeral I don't believe
[53:39] that our only duty there is to support
[53:42] you doing your wedding that's your happy
[53:45] time you want to go in the tree I hope I
[53:47] can claim there to do your
[53:49] wedding amen I hope I can be able to
[53:52] claim you know if I can claim I will
[53:55] stand up and says do you take that woman
[53:59] to be your lovely wife I'll stand right
[54:02] under the tree and I will do your
[54:05] wedding and uh so when it comes to that
[54:08] time and family want to do things all
[54:12] all our responsibility is to support you
[54:15] okay and we will tell you how far we can
[54:18] go with you and where we can go praise
[54:22] the Lorden and just like we will love to
[54:25] support you we will also want you to
[54:27] support us so it was it was a it was a
[54:30] great time working with uh the jbi
[54:33] family uh because uh we were we were
[54:36] working with uh the family that was here
[54:39] and the ones that were overseas both in
[54:42] in Europe and also in GH and uh and just
[54:46] like uh uh uh the son inlaw said
[54:49] yesterday uh brother brother Steve was a
[54:53] very quiet man
[54:56] but he had
[54:58] a he had a uh as much as it was a humble
[55:03] beginning he had a very big
[55:05] family actually brother Steve came from
[55:07] a royal
[55:09] family he was the only child of his
[55:12] mother and his mother came out of the
[55:15] Ashanti uh
[55:18] kiddom so if his funeral was back in
[55:21] Ghana it was going to be a whole week
[55:25] it was going to be a whole week they
[55:27] have all of their family rights and
[55:30] different things they were going to do
[55:33] was a very quiet man but there uh uh you
[55:38] know uh every time he was traveling most
[55:41] especially when he was going to Europe
[55:44] he will always uh you know he will
[55:47] always want to tell me after service
[55:50] when he was traveling because he never
[55:52] wanted it to look like I'm announcing in
[55:55] his travel he always you know will fuss
[55:58] with me of uh but I mean that's that I'm
[56:01] only doing it because we are praying for
[56:03] you I'm not doing it to celebrate you
[56:05] I'm do it announcing it so the church
[56:07] can pray for you but that was the kind
[56:09] of a man he was uh very very humble man
[56:14] and uh we love him and we will keep that
[56:17] in our hearts amen praise the Lord so
[56:20] thank you all for all of your support
[56:23] and and everything uh we want to greet
[56:26] uh uh brother Thomas uh that's our
[56:30] friend evangelist
[56:33] Thomas brother Thomas passed through
[56:35] here some time ago I think it's it's
[56:38] been twice we have had him but through
[56:41] just a passing through he spoke on one
[56:44] of our
[56:45] conventions I think uh there was when we
[56:49] have brother we have brother Dale Smith
[56:51] we have brother Jesse Smith we have
[56:54] brother
[56:55] I think uh clay farmer you know we had a

[57:14] personal friend to Brother Steve jbi
[57:17] they spend some time together went to

[57:23] hear Brother Steve pass away he called
[57:26] me and uh uh and he was going to hold
[57:31] his traveling back to Ghana until after
[57:34] the funeral so I uh we were kind of for
[57:38] working out the date uh for the funeral
[57:42] and then uh uh so I was hoping that he
[57:45] would come around the time we would do
[57:46] the funeral but then I've already Boke
[57:50] brother brother Tim asan to preach for

[1:10:49] think they were crossing the Atlantic
[1:10:51] and uh the Sheep had problem there was a

[1:11:00] on let us all
[1:11:03] pray if we can hold 30
[1:11:07] minutes we'll make it but if not in 30
[1:11:12] minutes we will go down to the bottom of
[1:11:14] the
[1:11:15] ocean and the sister said praise the
[1:11:18] Lord
[1:11:19] hallelujah Captain said do you hear what
[1:11:21] I said said
[1:11:22] sure
[1:11:24] he said it doesn't matter to
[1:11:26] me whether we go down or we make it he
[1:11:30] said why he said because over there in
[1:11:32] New York I got my child there and if you

[1:15:25] portion of the scriptures before we sit
[1:15:31] down just to encourage
[1:15:35] ourselves the Bible tells us to do
[1:15:40] that let's read from 1
[1:15:44] Samuel chapter
[1:15:48] 17 just to encourage
[1:15:52] ourselves
[1:15:55] shall we hear the word of the Lord 1
[1:15:58] Samuel chapter
[1:16:01] 17 let us
[1:16:05] read from verse
[1:16:10] 32 and then he said to
[1:16:14] Saul let no man's heart
[1:16:17] fail because of
[1:16:20] him thy servant will go
[1:16:23] and fight with this
[1:16:26] Philistine and sa said to
[1:16:29] David thou not able to go against this
[1:16:33] Philistine to fight with him for thou
[1:16:37] art but a youth and he a man of war from
[1:16:42] his
[1:16:44] Youth and David said unto
[1:16:48] s th servant kept his father's
[1:16:51] sheep and and there came a lion and a
[1:16:55] bear and took a lamb out of the
[1:16:59] flock and I went out after him and smot
[1:17:03] him and delivered it out of his
[1:17:07] mouth and when he arose against me I cut
[1:17:10] him by his beard and smoke him and slew
[1:17:15] him that Sant SLE both The Lion and the
[1:17:20] be and this uncircum
[1:17:23] Philistine shall be as one of
[1:17:27] them seeing he have the fire the armies
[1:17:33] of the Living
[1:17:35] God and David said
[1:17:39] moreover the Lord that delivered me out
[1:17:42] of the power of the lion and out of the
[1:17:46] power of the bear he will deliver me out
[1:17:50] of the hand of this
[1:17:52] philistine and sa said unto David
[1:17:57] go and the Lord be with thee amen amen
[1:18:01] amen shall we please be
[1:18:07] seated yes it
[1:18:09] is a great privilege
[1:18:13] again to serve the
[1:18:16] Lord it is always a privilege to come to
[1:18:19] the house of God and we love to come to
[1:18:23] church because God goes to
[1:18:28] church and uh if the Lord God is in your
[1:18:32] heart you will also go to church amen
[1:18:35] and I always said to people we should
[1:18:38] not come to the house of God as if we
[1:18:41] are Force we should come out of
[1:18:46] love we love the Lord we love his
[1:18:51] people and I I want to encourage us this
[1:18:54] morning to keep pressing
[1:18:56] on the few things I want to say from the
[1:19:00] scriptures is let no man's heart
[1:19:04] fail whatever the
[1:19:07] situation whatever the
[1:19:09] condition let no man's heart
[1:19:14] fail we are not here by
[1:19:17] chance we are not here by
[1:19:20] accident we are here for a p
[1:19:26] purose we didn't bring ourselves
[1:19:29] here he brought us here and is
[1:19:34] responsible of our journey on
[1:19:36] Earth so let no man's heart
[1:19:42] fail we are living in a time when the
[1:19:46] there's a lot of
[1:19:47] trouble in this word
[1:19:50] today the Bible says us
[1:19:53] men's heart will be failing for
[1:19:57] fear because of the things that are
[1:20:00] happening and we realize even the word
[1:20:04] leaders don't even know what to
[1:20:09] do
[1:20:12] nations are
[1:20:14] trembling nations are
[1:20:18] breaking rumors Wars rumors of War Wars
[1:20:23] here and Romans of
[1:20:25] wars that nobody even can predict what
[1:20:29] tomorrow is going to
[1:20:32] be because things just happen and it
[1:20:36] happens nobody was expecting Russia to
[1:20:39] invade go and attack Ukraine but he
[1:20:44] did nobody was expecting am M to invade
[1:20:49] Israel but they did and look look at the
[1:20:53] consequences and nobody can even tell
[1:20:56] what the m is going to
[1:21:00] be but what are we saying this morning
[1:21:02] no matter what is going to be let not
[1:21:05] your heart
[1:21:07] fail because somebody brought us here I
[1:21:12] I strongly believe in that amen as
[1:21:15] brother Brown said until God has
[1:21:18] finished with us nothing can take us
[1:21:20] from
[1:21:21] here amen you know last year by this
[1:21:24] time you know my condition very sick at
[1:21:28] the point of
[1:21:32] death that I could not do
[1:21:34] anything I could not
[1:21:38] walk I have to be I have to use the
[1:21:41] worker to
[1:21:43] work I would C for 9 months I could not
[1:21:50] be I was helpless
[1:21:54] I was wearing
[1:21:59] Pampers praise the Lord but here me
[1:22:02] standing
[1:22:04] today until God has finished with you
[1:22:08] nothing can take you from
[1:22:15] here praise the
[1:22:18] lord we believe our brother Steve serve
[1:22:21] the purpose of God
[1:22:25] I said I've known him we been at the
[1:22:27] refugee camp on the refugee camp we've
[1:22:30] been
[1:22:32] together you know our coming into this
[1:22:37] life we had no
[1:22:41] choice we did not
[1:22:43] decide when to come and when to
[1:22:47] go you you were not part of the
[1:22:51] decision it was all decided by our
[1:22:55] heavenly
[1:22:56] father we did not choose our mothers and
[1:23:00] our
[1:23:01] fathers it was all God that chose
[1:23:05] it where to be born when to be born we
[1:23:08] had no
[1:23:10] choice and to live out of here we have
[1:23:14] no
[1:23:15] choice
[1:23:17] Sunday God only know just where and when
[1:23:22] amen only God knows
[1:23:26] amen but the important thing is that it
[1:23:29] does not matter where when and
[1:23:32] how what matters is our relationship
[1:23:37] with our
[1:23:40] father don't wait to talk it over there
[1:23:44] talk it over
[1:23:45] here because over there it will be too
[1:23:50] late like we have been taught in the
[1:23:52] script
[1:23:54] creatures death does not change a
[1:23:58] person death only changes our dwelling
[1:24:03] place and whatever you are today in this
[1:24:08] hour when you live in that condition
[1:24:11] that is how you are going to be
[1:24:14] theread that brother P was speaking
[1:24:16] Friday and he told about Sam samel when
[1:24:19] he left here he was a prophet
[1:24:23] when they call him out he came as a
[1:24:26] prophet said if you're a liar here
[1:24:28] you'll be a liar over there whatever
[1:24:31] condition you are in
[1:24:33] here if you're a liar if you're a
[1:24:35] cheater if you
[1:24:38] whatever so may God help us to be up and
[1:24:42] be doing and to work out our salvation
[1:24:46] with fear and trembling because nobody
[1:24:51] knows when you going to leave
[1:24:54] here nobody
[1:24:57] knows we we we are what we are today by
[1:25:00] his
[1:25:01] grace and there is a
[1:25:04] purpose why God has paay your life and
[1:25:07] my life today it's not because we are
[1:25:09] better than those that have gone ahead
[1:25:11] of us but to me when I see a new day it
[1:25:15] is an opportunity God has given me to
[1:25:18] write in the
[1:25:19] wrong an opportunity to serve God Amen
[1:25:23] an opportunity to get closer to God an
[1:25:27] opportunity to put things
[1:25:30] together this is very important so when
[1:25:34] we have this opportunity let us make
[1:25:36] good use of it because nobody
[1:25:41] knows as we are here
[1:25:43] today when I think about
[1:25:47] Israel we love
[1:25:49] Israel I love Israel we love the people
[1:25:53] of
[1:25:54] God but when I begin to think about when
[1:25:58] 7th October when this Invasion came
[1:26:02] in and I heard it on the a I was sad I
[1:26:07] was going to preach someone I I was
[1:26:09] almost crying how did it
[1:26:12] happen
[1:26:14] because all over the world even America
[1:26:19] everybody knows the security of Israel
[1:26:22] the are the best you talk about security
[1:26:25] minded people is Israel so what
[1:26:28] happened and this overtook
[1:26:32] them and I begin to think about it you
[1:26:35] know at that time they were
[1:26:40] divided they were fighting among
[1:26:43] themselves
[1:26:46] politically the nation was almost at V
[1:26:50] of Civil War
[1:26:53] because of the reforms the Prime
[1:26:55] Minister want to do this reform and
[1:26:57] judicial reform and this one said no and
[1:26:59] this one said no and this
[1:27:02] politics so the nation was really
[1:27:07] divided and
[1:27:09] then the enemy took
[1:27:13] advantage because the enemy is always
[1:27:15] planning against us against God's people
[1:27:18] against the
[1:27:21] family
[1:27:23] so in their unguided
[1:27:26] moment the enemy is
[1:27:31] sneaking
[1:27:33] never in the history of
[1:27:36] Israel since they became a nation
[1:27:39] 1948 75 years ago never has it ever
[1:27:43] happened for so many Israelites to be
[1:27:47] killed in one day in their own land
[1:27:50] never because one person means a lot let
[1:27:54] alone over 1,400
[1:27:58] killed rape in their own
[1:28:02] land and all that's captured all that's
[1:28:06] wounded
[1:28:08] man what
[1:28:11] happened they were
[1:28:14] divided and when we get divided we
[1:28:19] fail the prophet said this let me just
[1:28:21] read it
[1:28:26] so that will as we are here should know
[1:28:30] that the enemy is always looking for
[1:28:34] us and we should know that we are in the
[1:28:39] battle a spiritual battle and we know
[1:28:42] that our enemy the Bible says as a
[1:28:45] rolling lion is working about seeking
[1:28:48] whom he made
[1:28:51] the
[1:28:53] he's not our brother he's our enemy
[1:28:55] Satan is our
[1:28:58] enemy he don't like us and we don't like
[1:29:03] him he's against us we against
[1:29:08] him praise the name of the Lord and I I
[1:29:10] Look to tell people you know since I
[1:29:12] said I don't want them to testify but I
[1:29:15] said to me I'm going to
[1:29:17] testify because sometime it puts you in
[1:29:20] people when you testify of what God has
[1:29:22] done for you the sickness will come back
[1:29:24] again I said don't worry devil if you
[1:29:26] come back God will take care of me again
[1:29:28] God will heal me
[1:29:32] again I'm never ashamed of the Gospel of
[1:29:35] Jesus
[1:29:36] Christ and I want you to stand firm for
[1:29:39] Christ amen I want to encourage your
[1:29:42] young men and young women to stand firm
[1:29:45] amen David said I've been young and now
[1:29:47] I am old I've never seen the righteous
[1:29:51] forsaken amen not the seed of the
[1:29:53] righteous begging for bread Don't Be
[1:29:57] Afraid let no man's heart fail amen we
[1:30:01] serve the Living God we serve the
[1:30:04] righteous God we serve the holy God and
[1:30:08] Our God Alone is the living one we are
[1:30:12] serving the king of glory we are serving
[1:30:14] him that said I get power to lay down my
[1:30:16] life and I get power to take it again he
[1:30:19] lay down his life and he took it again
[1:30:22] and he said behold I am alive forever
[1:30:24] more and I have the keys of death and a
[1:30:27] he holds everything so let no man's
[1:30:30] heart fail no matter
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:35] what he's the captain of our
[1:30:39] Salvation he's our
[1:30:42] King oh
[1:30:44] Hallelujah I'm so grateful to be part of
[1:30:47] his
[1:30:48] people I'm so grateful that he called me
[1:30:51] amen and I'm grateful that he has
[1:30:53] brought me this far am and today as
[1:30:56] always say if I drop down dead here
[1:30:59] because I'm finished and when God is
[1:31:01] finished with me I'm finished with this
[1:31:03] life and I don't want you to let no man
[1:31:06] live in fear of death don't let that
[1:31:09] torment you you going to die you're
[1:31:11] going to die oh yes sir if I die I will
[1:31:13] rise
[1:31:17] again we believe in the scriptures we
[1:31:20] believe the word of God we believe the
[1:31:23] promises of God that the promises of God
[1:31:26] are yeah and amen and Jesus said I am
[1:31:30] the
[1:31:32] resurrection oh and at the grave of
[1:31:34] Lazarus when when Jesus and M met and

[1:31:40] brother would not have died Jesus said
[1:31:43] your brother will rise
[1:31:46] again M knowing the resurrection he will
[1:31:49] I'm the
[1:31:50] resurrection praise God they didn't know

[1:31:58] resurrection your brother will rise

[1:54:13] talk to this one I don't want to talk to
[1:54:15] that man I don't want to do anything
[1:54:16] with that man and you're a Christian
[1:54:21] when Jesus
[1:54:23] said love your enemy as
[1:54:27] yourself love your neighbor as
[1:54:31] yourself love your husband love your
[1:54:34] wife love one another another above
[1:54:37] every no matter
[1:54:41] what did we ever read that scripture the
[1:54:44] Bible says us if you only greet those
[1:54:47] who greet you alone what more are you
[1:54:50] doing Than The Sinner and the ungodly
[1:54:54] person and I've always
[1:54:57] said Jesus said love your neighbor as
[1:55:00] yourself and I said if you cannot love
[1:55:02] your wife as your wife or you can't love
[1:55:05] your husband as your husband then love
[1:55:07] him as your
[1:55:13] neighbor because he said love your
[1:55:15] neighbor as
[1:55:16] yourself so if you cannot love him or
[1:55:19] love as your neighbor as your wife as
[1:55:21] your husband they love him as your
[1:55:24] neighbor okay I can if you can love him
[1:55:26] as your neighbor they love him as your
[1:55:28] enemy because Jesus said love your enemy
[1:55:31] [Music]
[1:55:34] too it's not for joke is Jes
[1:55:38] all so you have no
[1:55:41] chance we have no
[1:55:45] chance if you cannot love him as your
[1:55:48] wife or you cannot love her as your wife
[1:55:52] they love her as your neighbor because
[1:55:55] the Bible say love your neighbor as
[1:56:01] yourself can love they love him or her
[1:56:05] as your enemy because Jesus said love
[1:56:08] your
[1:56:09] enemies and pray for those who despise F
[1:56:13] use
[1:56:18] you
[1:56:20] this is God sayest the
[1:56:22] Lord this is from the mouth of Jesus
[1:56:25] Christ so why is our
[1:56:28] Christianity where are we that say we

[1:59:41] Revelation with the teachings with all
[1:59:42] what are you going to stand before God
[1:59:44] what will be our excuse on that
[1:59:48] day
[1:59:51] oh brother you are scared no we are all
[1:59:54] in the same
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:57] boat the prophet of God said no mortal
[2:00:01] can stand before God and condemn another
[2:00:03] mortal
[2:00:05] amen
[2:00:07] amen he said you can't stand with a
[2:00:10] mortar in the presence of God and
[2:00:13] condemn anybody I don't believe no sir
[2:00:18] even if he is a rank
[2:00:21] Sinner and what about a brother that has
[2:00:24] made a
[2:00:25] mistake though I say he is wrong
[2:00:29] sometimes he accused wrong when he is
[2:00:33] not wrong amen sometime we accuse people
[2:00:37] amen oh this one is this this one
[2:00:40] sometime it's not like that
[2:00:42] am May almighty God help us my
[2:00:47] brothers and make ourselves ready
[2:00:51] amen any time any
[2:00:54] hour our brothers have gone with with
[2:00:58] testimonies we're hearing the testimony
[2:01:00] of brother
[2:01:01] Steven he's
[2:01:05] gone he gone
[2:01:08] am so tomorrow I will
[2:01:13] go who will go before nobody
[2:01:17] knows but like I said it does not
[2:01:22] matter it's not how long we stay here it
[2:01:26] is what we do with what is given to us
[2:01:29] today is yours tomorrow may never
[2:01:31] yours so don't even say tomorrow that's
[2:01:34] what the Bible if we want to say
[2:01:36] anything say if God
[2:01:40] Wills my
[2:01:42] brothers we should not take the things
[2:01:44] of God
[2:01:46] lightly all for granted
[2:01:49] and as I said many times to people don't
[2:01:52] even compare your life to somebody
[2:01:55] else because you are no Timothy and I'm
[2:01:58] not
[2:01:59] Joseph I'm not brother
[2:02:02] one you are not sister Grace you are not
[2:02:06] sister Mery look at the children brother
[2:02:08] Ste children everybody is different we
[2:02:11] are different ATI and so don't even
[2:02:15] compare your life with somebody
[2:02:17] else because a rich scripture I see
[2:02:20] people are very different there was
[2:02:22] Andrews there was Simon Peter they are
[2:02:26] brothers but they all
[2:02:27] different Peter talks Andrew never
[2:02:30] talk there is Dr
[2:02:33] Luke and there is different men Philip
[2:02:36] naani this one they were all different
[2:02:38] and we are all different that's why we
[2:02:40] are some people are tall some people are
[2:02:43] short some people are fat some people
[2:02:45] are sleep there are some people no
[2:02:47] matter what they eat they are just the
[2:02:50] same amen no matter what they eat they
[2:02:54] are the same have not people when we
[2:02:56] were young men and if you see us eating
[2:02:58] Fufu
[2:02:59] there and this one will eat and the
[2:03:02] mother will say to the where does the
[2:03:04] food
[2:03:07] go because no matter what he e is the
[2:03:10] same and somebody take water and it's
[2:03:12] swelling
[2:03:15] up so we are made different for
[2:03:18] different purposes
[2:03:19] so it is not wise to compare yourself
[2:03:22] with somebody
[2:03:23] else no no it's not wise like I said
[2:03:26] Peter was thrown into jail he was in
[2:03:29] jail H and they and and and the people
[2:03:31] were praying and as they prayed midnight
[2:03:35] the angel of God
[2:03:36] descended God chose to do that midnight
[2:03:39] not because he was afraid of soldiers no
[2:03:42] no God is Not Afraid of
[2:03:45] nobody but midnight the angel of the
[2:03:47] Lord came down he went right to the
[2:03:50] prison Peter was sleeping and he wake
[2:03:52] him up get
[2:03:54] up sit now thank
[2:03:59] you amen as Peter got up the angel told
[2:04:03] him take your Sanders take your jacket
[2:04:07] the angel said follow me the soldiers
[2:04:09] were s sleeping they were lying down the
[2:04:13] chains fell off may your chains fall off
[2:04:17] am
[2:04:20] [Music]

[2:04:27] matter what entangle you may the chain
[2:04:29] fall off may god Set You Free as you are

[2:15:40] said why I C said don't cry you to use
[2:15:43] that
[2:15:45] policy and I took it oh brother the next
[2:15:48] time I use it it was
[2:15:51] effective
[2:15:53] honestly I told you the story one time
[2:15:55] one boy fighting I was in elementary
[2:15:57] school and it just T and I was fighting
[2:16:00] and he was hitting I said I realized
[2:16:02] this was not doing much help so it came
[2:16:05] to my mind what my father
[2:16:07] said and I said this boy I will bite off
[2:16:10] his
[2:16:11] nose
[2:16:13] yes I wanted to bite his nose
[2:16:16] he and I got his TB in my mouth and I
[2:16:20] close my
[2:16:22] mouth and I close it and jam
[2:16:25] it you biting you you biting I didn't
[2:16:28] mind him you it's a fight the next day
[2:16:31] he was coming to school they said what
[2:16:34] happened he said I shouldn't go to bite
[2:16:35] I said correct he never tried me again
[2:16:38] what is it Prophet said we must use
[2:16:40] every gift at our disposal whatever God
[2:16:43] put in the church every gift that God
[2:16:45] has given every brother will we need
[2:16:48] every one of us we need everybody to
[2:16:51] push the work of God
[2:16:54] forward every scripture every promise
[2:16:58] that has been given to us we must use it
[2:17:01] you must realize who you are realize and
[2:17:03] recognize your position and know that
[2:17:06] this man can do better than me this
[2:17:08] sister can do better than me if this let
[2:17:11] him do it and let's do it wholeheartedly
[2:17:14] with God in our heart to be a blessing
[2:17:16] to the body of
[2:17:23] Christ Lord help us
[2:17:25] am don't compare yourself to anybody you
[2:17:29] are unique your wife is unique your
[2:17:32] sisters are unique oh I don't I want my
[2:17:34] sister to be like me it will not be
[2:17:36] possible because they were not made to
[2:17:38] be like you we are not made to be like
[2:17:40] one another we are made to be like Jesus
[2:17:43] Christ and the only thing that will make
[2:17:45] us to be like Jesus Christ is the Hol
[2:17:47] Holy
[2:17:50] Ghost may God help us do you love the
[2:17:54] Lord I also love the Lord and I'm saying
[2:17:58] this to encourage you don't compare
[2:18:00] yourself because when you do that it
[2:18:02] brings
[2:18:04] confusion like I said Peter was in
[2:18:07] prison the angel came and took him out
[2:18:10] Paul was in prison too the angel didn't
[2:18:13] take him out that's right the doors open
[2:18:17] when Peter and Paul was Paul and Silas
[2:18:19] sang in the prison the door open but
[2:18:21] they stayed in the prison they didn't go
[2:18:24] out what about oh Peter ran out Peter
[2:18:27] went out Peter didn't run out the angel
[2:18:29] took him out Paul and Silas stayed there
[2:18:32] until the
[2:18:33] morning and when the Jailer or the
[2:18:35] inspector whoever it was woke up and saw
[2:18:37] the door open he took knife he said hey
[2:18:39] don't do don't do yourself evil we are
[2:18:43] here we are
[2:18:45] here it changed everything about about
[2:18:47] that
[2:18:48] man he had because he has seen prisoners
[2:18:52] broke Jil and ran out that's why he want
[2:18:55] to kill himself you know the consequence
[2:18:57] that if you let a prisoner go you will
[2:18:59] stay with your
[2:19:01] life so he want to kill himself said no
[2:19:05] we are here if they run out that man
[2:19:09] would have been
[2:19:11] killed for
[2:19:14] nothing but they stayed there and
[2:19:17] because they stayed that man and his
[2:19:19] family were
[2:19:20] saved the reason he went to prison was
[2:19:23] for that man's and the family God might
[2:19:26] have taken steeven
[2:19:28] away God has taken our brother Steven
[2:19:31] away for some
[2:19:33] purpose your father your in-law the
[2:19:36] uncle the grandpa God has taken in away
[2:19:41] for a purpose don't miss that
[2:19:45] purpose don't
