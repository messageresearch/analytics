[48:59] a good meeting with them
[49:01] and uh what a service we had
[49:05] but I I left God in on the dead on
[49:09] Thursday I I think the temperature
[49:12] changed kind of effectively it was a bit
[49:14] warmer year than it was there
[49:17] so
[49:18] because it was warm I never went with a
[49:21] jacket
[49:22] so I forgot I was going to Alaska
[49:26] and then we got in and we had to prepare
[49:30] for the service that night
[49:32] and preach our heart out and
[49:36] so uh trying to break myself with the
[49:39] weather and with a sweating shirt on so
[49:41] I think all of that got a hold of me in
[49:44] a little bit so we got under the weather
[49:47] and and felt a little bit sick but the
[49:52] Lord came down during the meetings and
[49:54] he was able to to bless us with his
[49:57] presence amen good enough I preached
[50:01] Thursday night and then I had to close
[50:02] the service on Sunday so it gave me some
[50:05] time to rest

[52:22] going to receive praise the Lord if you
[52:25] go with that attitude you will be
[52:27] blessed you have to realize you are
[52:29] caring more than you go to receive if
[52:32] you think that you are just going to
[52:34] work because you need a dollar you need
[52:36] more money so you're going to work
[52:38] overtime and you are not valuing what
[52:41] you have what you are carrying when you
[52:44] sit behind your desks when you sit in
[52:46] your break room or wherever you are and
[52:49] you buy your hairs and commit your work

[53:01] caring more than you are going to
[53:02] receive because you are honor a promise
[53:05] blessed is he that gave then rest then
[53:08] then he that receive amen so you are
[53:10] going as a giver more than as a receiver

[53:19] that the Lord will bless you we pray
[53:20] that the Lord will keep each and every
[53:22] one of you as as you face your future

[55:40] [Music]
[55:42] [Applause]
[55:45] you know I was just I was just thinking
[55:48] about it and uh
[55:51] because of uh
[55:53] school and different things
[55:55] growing up uh we we really didn't have
[55:59] much time to spend together as as young
[56:03] younger brothers so I remember the first
[56:06] time he came to pick me up I said
[56:07] remember that he brought a camera he
[56:09] wanted to take our picture wanted to
[56:11] make sure that he get a picture of his
[56:12] little brother so he came and picked me
[56:15] up and then took me out and uh
[56:18] but I was thinking about it that we have
[56:22] this time to spend some time together
[56:25] and we just we talked family life and
[56:29] talk different things and even things
[56:32] around the ministry so is it's been a
[56:36] blessing praise the Lord I
[56:39] have been a blessing to have a bigger
[56:41] brother that will support you in what
[56:42] you are doing amen
[56:44] he support and respect what I'm doing so
[56:47] good to have you Reverend reefs maybe
[56:49] I'll give you a few minutes to come and
[56:51] greet the church and
[56:53] speak
[56:54] you almost becoming a household person
[56:57] because
[56:59] come on
[57:02] [Music]
[57:09] God again
[57:10] [Music]
[57:16] [Applause]
[57:24] am I on Can You Hear Me
[57:27] right so sometimes that's that's pasta
[57:30] things go
[57:31] it gets very difficult for us sometimes
[57:34] there are some instances where
[57:37] it's just overwhelming
[57:41] all that we can do is just give it up
[57:44] to the Lord in prayer
[57:48] a few weeks ago
[57:50] [Music]
[57:52] it was his mother
[57:54] in church
[57:56] whoever
[57:58] Sunday
[58:00] she's about
[58:00] [Music]
[58:02] I guess in her late 70s
[58:05] but strong good move she hardly gained
[58:09] that she could walk with
[58:11] and every Sunday she will come
[58:14] because after service I would just try
[58:17] to remain in my city then
[58:19] people will come
[58:21] so every Sunday should always be the
[58:23] last to come
[58:24] and the first thing once you come up to
[58:26] me she would say pastor
[58:30] don't get tired with me
[58:34] don't get tired of me now I said no I'm
[58:36] not tired with you I will always be here
[58:39] to listen to you
[58:42] so
[58:45] that Sunday I'm talking a few Sundays
[58:48] before the last Sunday in in May
[58:53] [Music]
[58:56] she came in
[58:59] but she was always coming
[59:02] for her grandchildren
[59:04] thinking what her grandchildren would
[59:06] eat for that week
[59:08] [Music]
[59:09] and she will come up to me and say
[59:11] Pastor just this
[59:13] [Music]
[59:15] and I would say just wait around and
[59:19] wait and then I would after service make
[59:23] sure she have something to take home
[59:25] [Music]
[59:27] so that Sunday she came and the women
[59:31] were also planning for their mother's
[59:34] day so she was always in the meeting she
[59:38] didn't have much to give
[59:40] but her presence was always there
[59:43] [Music]
[59:45] so some of them have already volunteered
[59:47] to buy or
[59:50] clothes that they will be wearing that
[59:51] on that Mother's Day
[59:54] and
[59:56] Monday after service she was in the
[1:00:00] community moving
[1:00:01] [Music]
[1:00:02] Tuesday morning she woke up
[1:00:07] Coke
[1:00:08] got dressed
[1:00:10] just got dressed
[1:00:12] wore her skirt
[1:00:16] blouse she tied her head
[1:00:19] [Music]
[1:00:20] and people in the community said she
[1:00:23] walked around apparently she was just
[1:00:26] telling people goodbye
[1:00:30] and then she went
[1:00:32] in her room not even just lie down and
[1:00:35] die
[1:00:36] oh
[1:00:38] [Music]
[1:00:39] so I was at work and he called me
[1:00:43] then you wear to take her body
[1:00:46] so I said okay you'll just wait when I
[1:00:48] get off work I will come over
[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:53] so I went over and then I think it was
[1:00:56] around 6 30 7
[1:01:00] called
[1:01:02] those of you from Library Road Anderson
[1:01:04] Funeral Home
[1:01:06] and it came and
[1:01:09] so when it came to check out about it
[1:01:12] I managed to just slip in to just see
[1:01:16] see her just lying
[1:01:19] and I I saw her
[1:01:22] dress up
[1:01:24] as if she was ready to go
[1:01:31] and then they put her in the bag
[1:01:36] I'm saying all of this to say it is it
[1:01:39] is always good to give God praise
[1:01:42] because we don't know the next movement
[1:01:44] what may happen to us
[1:01:46] right
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:48] it's always good to give him praise
[1:01:51] [Music]
[1:01:54] so this morning as we
[1:01:57] [Music]
[1:01:58] one of the passage that uh
[1:02:01] spoke to me through the week
[1:02:04] was Genesis 8 verse 22.
[1:02:07] I don't know what you can put it on the
[1:02:09] screen in the body
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:12] it says the Earth we mean it
[1:02:15] sea time
[1:02:17] and harvest
[1:02:20] coal and Heat
[1:02:22] summer and winter
[1:02:25] night and day
[1:02:28] shall not cease
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:34] so if you look at all of those
[1:02:37] things that are mentioned there
[1:02:42] are two events
[1:02:45] that we have control over
[1:02:48] and that is
[1:02:50] I will see time
[1:02:53] and I will have as time
[1:02:57] cool and Heat
[1:02:58] is in God's hand he control when to make
[1:03:01] the place forward to make it hard he
[1:03:03] controls when someone and winter comes
[1:03:06] he controls day and night
[1:03:09] for sea time and Harvest Time
[1:03:13] are in our control he allowed us
[1:03:18] so what are we doing with
[1:03:22] our sea time
[1:03:26] because there will be a harvest
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:31] but if you don't soar
[1:03:33] you will not Harvest
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:38] the best thing that you can sow is your
[1:03:41] life
[1:03:45] I know that on that great get in the
[1:03:47] morning you will have it your life again
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:57] so we want to thank God for the
[1:03:58] opportunity to see all of you again
[1:04:01] I bring you greetings from my family and
[1:04:03] my church
[1:04:06] who pray that God bless all of us
[1:04:08] and keep all of us
[1:04:11] in Jesus name amen
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:17] [Applause]
[1:04:20] foreign
[1:04:31] amen I wanted to sing a song but I don't
[1:04:33] have the voice too so thank you
[1:04:36] musicians that would be it for singing
[1:04:39] and then we would just uh
[1:04:42] try to go right into the world like I
[1:04:44] said I won't keep you long
[1:04:46] this morning I want to go back to uh
[1:04:50] Saint John chapter 4.
[1:04:54] we started speaking on generation
[1:04:57] conflict
[1:04:59] and then the last time we spoke from
[1:05:01] there was
[1:05:07] knew the gift of God
[1:05:11] so we want to go back to Genesis I mean
[1:05:14] say John chapter 4.
[1:05:23] thank you very Reeves
[1:05:24] there's a
[1:05:28] that's that's what I I love that verse
[1:05:32] but that inspiration was was was
[1:05:35] wonderful
[1:05:36] praise the Lord
[1:05:38] their inspiration was wonderful looking
[1:05:41] at the seating time and the Harvest Time
[1:05:44] praise the Lord
[1:05:45] and we don't have control over uh the
[1:05:49] winter in summer neither the day and
[1:05:52] night God controls that
[1:05:55] but he has he has called us as laborers
[1:06:00] in his field praise the Lord he has
[1:06:03] bought the seed of the word in our hands
[1:06:06] so
[1:06:08] in the sense of having control over your
[1:06:12] yours your seeding and harvest time is
[1:06:15] it all depends on what you are doing
[1:06:17] with your work with the word what you
[1:06:19] are doing with your life praise the Lord
[1:06:22] so that's I mean that was a wonderful
[1:06:24] inspiration
[1:06:27] that was a wonderful inspiration I'm
[1:06:29] going to
[1:06:30] uh my brother say I'm going to keep
[1:06:33] their honor my faith rape
[1:06:36] okay and I will use it whenever it's
[1:06:38] lethal
[1:06:39] praise the Lord
[1:06:41] we we want to look at the St John
[1:06:45] chapter four
[1:06:49] we want to look at Saint John chapter 4.
[1:06:57] let's read from verse 1
[1:06:59] when therefore the Lord
[1:07:02] knew how the Pharisees
[1:07:06] have heard that Jesus made and and
[1:07:09] baptized more disciples than John
[1:07:14] though Jesus himself baptized net but
[1:07:18] his disciples
[1:07:19] he left Judea and departed into Galilee
[1:07:23] and he must go and he must need go
[1:07:27] through Samira
[1:07:29] then cometh he to the city of Samira
[1:07:33] which
[1:07:34] is called soccer amen
[1:07:38] now that that that city is important
[1:07:42] because uh in the in uh
[1:07:48] in the Old Testament we would Trace that
[1:07:50] try to trace that a little bit back you
[1:07:53] will see that uh because the Old
[1:07:55] Testament was translated in Hebrew the
[1:07:58] New Testament was translated in Greek so
[1:08:01] there are there are places where you
[1:08:04] find like the in the New Testament there
[1:08:07] in Matthew they will call Elijah Elias
[1:08:10] you know those kind of pronunciation so
[1:08:14] this city of sakat is the same as
[1:08:17] searching the first place that Abraham
[1:08:19] uh made an altar to the Lord
[1:08:24] but what what brings it what brings it
[1:08:27] into Clarity is that then coming he to
[1:08:31] the city of Samira which is called Shaka
[1:08:34] near to the parcel of ground that Jacob
[1:08:38] gave to his son Joseph
[1:08:43] now Jacob well was there
[1:08:48] Jesus therefore been wearing
[1:08:51] with his journey
[1:08:53] set us on the well and it was about
[1:08:57] the sixth hour
[1:09:00] there cometh a woman of Samira to draw
[1:09:03] water
[1:09:04] Jesus said unto her give me to drink
[1:09:08] for his disciple were gone away onto the
[1:09:11] city to buy meat then said the woman of
[1:09:15] Samira unto him how is it that thou
[1:09:18] being the Jews acts drink of me which
[1:09:22] I'm a woman of Samira
[1:09:25] for the Jews have no dealing so there's
[1:09:28] there was that word where we identified
[1:09:30] as a place of conflict have no dealing
[1:09:33] with the Samaritans
[1:09:36] and Jesus answered and said unto her if
[1:09:40] that kneweth the gift of God and who it
[1:09:43] is that said unto thee give me to drink
[1:09:46] thou who they have asked of him and he
[1:09:49] who have given the Living Water
[1:09:54] praise the Lord
[1:09:57] the Lord bless you you can have your
[1:09:58] seat while we continue to read
[1:10:01] the woman said unto him sir there have
[1:10:05] nothing to draw with
[1:10:07] and the world is deep from Wayne's then
[1:10:11] have doubt that Living Water
[1:10:14] they are greater than our father
[1:10:17] Jacob which gave us the wealth and also
[1:10:22] if you if you go back and look into into
[1:10:25] Genesis Jacob's Well was in a shashem
[1:10:30] so uh the the Greek had that city called
[1:10:35] soccer but it's the same and I'm saying
[1:10:39] that because I want to I want to use a
[1:10:41] little uh uh map here to be able to
[1:10:46] create a picture of what we want to talk
[1:10:48] about this morning
[1:10:50] laughs
[1:10:51] praise the Lord
[1:10:53] at that greater verse 12 I die greater
[1:10:55] than our father Jacob which gave us the
[1:10:59] wealth and drained there of himself and
[1:11:03] his children and his cattles Jesus
[1:11:06] answered and said unto her
[1:11:09] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:11:13] thirst again
[1:11:15] but whosoever drinketh of the water
[1:11:19] that I shall give him shall never thirst
[1:11:22] but the water that I shall give him
[1:11:25] shall be in him a well
[1:11:29] of water sprinkling up
[1:11:31] into everlasting life and the woman said
[1:11:35] unto him sir give me this water that I
[1:11:39] touched neither come here to drink Jesus
[1:11:42] said you know go call your husband and
[1:11:46] uh and uh and you know that go and call
[1:11:51] your husband
[1:11:54] the woman answered Jesus I have no
[1:11:56] husband he said there there has well
[1:11:58] said I have no husband
[1:12:01] fall down
[1:12:03] have had five husbands and he whom they
[1:12:07] are now
[1:12:09] he whom there now have is not the
[1:12:13] houseman
[1:12:14] in their Syria they are the truth
[1:12:18] the woman said unto him sir I perceive
[1:12:20] that there are a prophet
[1:12:23] now she she came to that conclusion
[1:12:26] because
[1:12:28] uh Jesus have just discerned her need
[1:12:32] Jesus had just descended what she was
[1:12:34] dealing with praise the Lord more than
[1:12:37] the conflict of Jews and Gentiles she
[1:12:40] had an internal conflict going on so
[1:12:43] Jesus was able to discern that need they
[1:12:46] have brought her to the place of uh of
[1:12:50] uh recognizing that this could be a
[1:12:53] Prophet this could be a man of God the
[1:12:56] woman
[1:12:57] said I perceived thou I a prophet our
[1:13:00] fathers Worship in this mountain
[1:13:04] and yes say that in Jerusalem is the
[1:13:09] place where men are to worship
[1:13:13] now that's what I want to do this
[1:13:16] morning
[1:13:17] the place of worship
[1:13:19] I want to talk a little bit on the place
[1:13:22] of worship
[1:13:23] praise the Lord
[1:13:25] amen I want to speak a little bit on the
[1:13:28] place of worship
[1:13:31] so I pray that the Lord will be able to
[1:13:35] bless each and every one of you like the
[1:13:38] text message went out uh sister Merritt
[1:13:41] is doing a little better in the hospital

[1:13:48] so they can kind of figure out what's
[1:13:51] what's going on there with with her
[1:13:53] heart I think she had a more like a
[1:13:57] panic attack uh
[1:14:00] but her heart was completely out of
[1:14:03] balance out of reading it was you know
[1:14:06] it was just completely written and she
[1:14:10] she went
[1:14:12] she blocked out for a while not knowing
[1:14:15] what was happening around her so it was
[1:14:18] good that I
[1:14:20] that someone was there to be able to
[1:14:22] call
[1:14:23] the ambulance to take her to the
[1:14:26] hospital but by the grace of God she's
[1:14:29] doing much better they have they have
[1:14:31] stabilized her and uh
[1:14:34] and the
[1:14:38] they are trying to just understand
[1:14:39] what's happening with her system praise
[1:14:42] the Lord

[1:15:53] Samaritans have no dealing with the
[1:15:55] Gentiles when both of them are claiming
[1:15:58] Jacob as their father amen both of them
[1:16:01] I claim you right to Jacob's Well they
[1:16:04] are claiming the Patriots as their
[1:16:06] father then but then where came the
[1:16:08] division where came uh uh the the the
[1:16:12] the Discrimination for how to think that
[1:16:16] uh uh
[1:16:19] Jacob I mean to think that the the
[1:16:22] Samaritans have no dealing with the Jews
[1:16:26] but this would take us back to the book
[1:16:29] of Deuteronomy if you want to get a
[1:16:31] clear picture of this you will have to
[1:16:34] go back to the the book of Deuteronomy
[1:16:36] and there is something I want for us to
[1:16:38] study together so let's do that as we go
[1:16:41] back to Deuteronomy chapter 27.
[1:16:54] this book is is sometimes called by some
[1:16:58] Scholars as the book of two laws it's
[1:17:01] now actually two laws it is just that
[1:17:04] Moses is rehearsing he's now rehearsing
[1:17:08] reminding the people about the adjoining
[1:17:11] and everything that he has said to them
[1:17:13] that's what is happening he's coming to
[1:17:15] the end of his days
[1:17:17] praise the Lord he's coming to the end
[1:17:20] of his days
[1:17:22] and right here over in uh
[1:17:29] uh this chapter is going to is going to
[1:17:33] lay before the people
[1:17:37] he's going to lay before the people some
[1:17:40] very important things and I want for us
[1:17:43] to to study there together let's read
[1:17:45] from verse 27 verse 1 I mean verse 1
[1:17:47] chapter 27.
[1:17:51] and Moses were the others of Israel
[1:17:54] commanded the people saying keep all the
[1:17:56] Commandments which I command you this
[1:17:59] day
[1:18:00] and it shall be on the day when
[1:18:04] ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land
[1:18:08] which the Lord that God gaveth they that
[1:18:12] thou shalt set
[1:18:14] thee up
[1:18:15] great stones and plaster them
[1:18:20] with plastered
[1:18:22] and thou shall write upon them all the
[1:18:27] words of this Lord
[1:18:29] when thou art pass over
[1:18:33] that thou may go in onto the land which
[1:18:37] the Lord
[1:18:38] thy God give it thee and land that
[1:18:42] floureth with milk and honey
[1:18:46] as the Lord
[1:18:48] as as
[1:18:49] the Lord God of the fathers have
[1:18:52] promised thee
[1:18:54] praise the Lord
[1:18:56] therefore it shall be when ye when ye be
[1:19:01] gone over Jordan
[1:19:03] that yesha set up these Stones which I
[1:19:08] command you this day
[1:19:11] in Mount EBA
[1:19:13] and thou shall plaster them with plaster
[1:19:18] and there
[1:19:20] shall thou build an altar unto the Lord
[1:19:24] that God and altar of stones Thou shalt
[1:19:29] not lift up any iron tools upon them
[1:19:33] praise the Lord
[1:19:36] and all sort of stones you will just
[1:19:38] gather the stones and bring it together
[1:19:40] there is no breaking there is no
[1:19:42] knocking just take the stones and bring
[1:19:44] them together build an altar Thou shalt
[1:19:48] Bill verse says thou shall build the
[1:19:50] altar of the Lord thy God
[1:19:55] of whole stones and thou shalt offer
[1:19:58] burn offering there on unto the Lord thy
[1:20:02] God and thou shall offer peace offering
[1:20:05] and shall eat there and rejoice before
[1:20:08] the Lord thy God
[1:20:10] and they all shall write upon the stones
[1:20:13] all the words of this law very plainly
[1:20:19] praise the Lord
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:23] now so with this setting is is uh is is
[1:20:28] giving us and uh you know what an idea
[1:20:30] of the stones that Joshua gathered from
[1:20:33] the Jordan and the bill and Altar and uh
[1:20:37] uh and we know that there were there was
[1:20:39] another heap of stones that were built
[1:20:41] in the midst of Jordan and there was
[1:20:44] another altar that was built uh uh out
[1:20:47] of Jordan so they had 12 Stones in
[1:20:49] Jordan and 12 Stones Out of Jordan
[1:20:53] and uh yeah Moses is asking the people
[1:20:56] to plaster those stones and they will
[1:20:58] write the Commandments of the Lord to be
[1:21:01] able to remind him there was there's a
[1:21:02] reason for that there's a reason the
[1:21:05] purpose here is that uh God wanted the
[1:21:10] people to remember
[1:21:12] that God performed his promises
[1:21:18] praise the Lord
[1:21:20] God performed When God Says something
[1:21:24] he performed his promises
[1:21:28] and and and and the writing of The
[1:21:31] Commandments on those stones was to
[1:21:34] remind the people
[1:21:36] that the breaking of them into the
[1:21:39] promised land was based on his promised
[1:21:43] word
[1:21:44] right
[1:21:45] praise the Lord
[1:21:47] it was not only because they have
[1:21:49] suffered in Egypt
[1:21:51] because you have to realize it was not
[1:21:54] only the children of Israel that was in
[1:21:57] Egypt Egypt was a superpower at that
[1:21:59] time and they have conquered many
[1:22:02] nations yes but it was only these people
[1:22:05] that had a promise that after 400 years
[1:22:10] God says I will come down
[1:22:12] and I will bring you out with a mighty
[1:22:15] hand right it was only the Jews it was
[1:22:18] only the Hebrews that had a promise
[1:22:23] they're all the people that were in
[1:22:24] Egypt that were you know that were
[1:22:26] captured by the Egyptian army they never
[1:22:28] had a promise
[1:22:30] right only these people had a promise
[1:22:34] now so God yeah was reminding them
[1:22:38] they will always keep the words of the
[1:22:42] Lord before them so they can remember
[1:22:44] that it is based on his work based on
[1:22:48] his promises that he's dealing with us
[1:22:52] praise the Lord
[1:22:54] amen it is not based on how sorrowful we
[1:22:59] are or what our need is there are people
[1:23:02] that are more needed than us
[1:23:07] praise the Lord
[1:23:09] you look in yummy and and other parts of
[1:23:12] the word there there there are they are
[1:23:15] starving people
[1:23:18] they are homeless people
[1:23:22] so you see God was trying to remind him
[1:23:26] that they might always keep before them
[1:23:30] that God performed his promises amen
[1:23:36] praise the Lord
[1:23:38] and then also here
[1:23:41] you will see it as you as you go down
[1:23:43] with the reading
[1:23:45] that Moses brought them to to this place
[1:23:49] of these two mountains
[1:23:52] and actually
[1:23:54] this place of session soccer was right
[1:23:59] in the Valley of the two mountains that
[1:24:02] Moses is going to talk about here
[1:24:04] right
[1:24:06] in uh
[1:24:07] Deuteronomy chapter 27
[1:24:11] this place where this woman was turning
[1:24:14] and saying that we Samaritan we worship
[1:24:17] God on this mountain and you say it's in
[1:24:20] Jerusalem that the law that that God
[1:24:22] should be worshiped she was standing in
[1:24:24] the valley
[1:24:26] of the very same Mountain where Moses
[1:24:28] was talking about
[1:24:32] praise the Lord
[1:24:35] and as we as we read instead of yeah you
[1:24:39] will realize uh uh uh these two
[1:24:42] mountains are described as the mountain
[1:24:45] of curse and the mountain of blessing
[1:24:52] Mount Eva was the mountain of curse
[1:24:56] man Garrison was the mountain of
[1:24:58] blessing
[1:25:00] and as she's standing in this Valley
[1:25:02] she's referring to these two places
[1:25:05] and saying that our father said it is on
[1:25:10] this mountain which is Mount Garrison
[1:25:14] that we should worship and you say this
[1:25:16] in Jerusalem
[1:25:18] is
[1:25:24] praise the Lord
[1:25:30] is the picture coming together
[1:25:33] praise the Lord but before we go
[1:25:36] we go
[1:25:38] father
[1:25:46] Moses will take
[1:25:48] the
[1:25:51] he would take the the the the
[1:25:55] Psalms of the Patriot the hands of the
[1:25:58] tribe
[1:25:59] and he will take six of them and
[1:26:01] identify them with each of the mountains
[1:26:05] you know
[1:26:06] praise the Lord amen and we can we can
[1:26:10] go into all of their verse 11 and Moses
[1:26:12] charged the people saying these days uh
[1:26:15] charge the people the same they're
[1:26:18] saying they shall stand upon my Garrison
[1:26:22] and then he called the name of all the
[1:26:24] ones that we stand on my Garrison and
[1:26:27] then he he also deal with the ones that
[1:26:31] will stand on Eber
[1:26:35] we can go into that and and but there
[1:26:38] are some things I want us to look at
[1:26:40] before we go any further
[1:26:43] from verse 14
[1:26:46] .
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:50] don't worry we'll find our place of
[1:26:53] worship amen
[1:26:59] you know
[1:27:01] you read the scripture
[1:27:04] and you read about the different cities
[1:27:07] that was in Bible days the word has not
[1:27:10] changed that's right cities have only
[1:27:13] developed
[1:27:15] amen
[1:27:16] and with the development of those cities
[1:27:18] they might change their names
[1:27:23] praise the Lord but the word has not
[1:27:25] changed
[1:27:28] you can travel and take and take uh uh
[1:27:32] and take and take the Bible
[1:27:35] and Trace every city
[1:27:39] that is written in this Bible you can
[1:27:42] trace it and you will still find it
[1:27:44] where it is it might have been affected
[1:27:47] by an earthquake it might have been
[1:27:48] affected by some some disaster but the
[1:27:52] word is still the same
[1:27:57] praise the Lord
[1:28:00] a blessed memory but George Martin's uh
[1:28:04] uh he just want to be with the Lord that
[1:28:06] is in in South Africa he's uh he's a
[1:28:09] good uh uh teacher in the world and and
[1:28:12] uh uh he was able to uh
[1:28:17] uh he was able to get a recognition from
[1:28:20] the Israeli government
[1:28:22] because he took the Bible
[1:28:24] to be able to show them a place by the
[1:28:28] scripture that this is the place that
[1:28:31] the Bible was talking about and they
[1:28:33] sent researcher and archaeologist there
[1:28:36] and they were able to realize that
[1:28:39] George Martin was saying exactly the
[1:28:41] truth I can remember the name of the
[1:28:43] city but the Israeli government gave him
[1:28:45] a recognition for that that he was able
[1:28:48] to identify a place in Israel by the
[1:28:50] scripture
[1:28:54] very very great teacher
[1:28:57] very great teacher
[1:29:02] now so
[1:29:04] we come down here to verse 14 the Bible
[1:29:06] says and the Levi shall speak and say
[1:29:10] unto the men of Israel with a loud voice
[1:29:14] now I want you to pay attention to this
[1:29:16] I want you to pay attention to this
[1:29:20] curse be the man
[1:29:24] that maketh an engraving image or Martin
[1:29:28] image an Abomination unto the Lord
[1:29:32] The Works of the hands of craftmen
[1:29:37] and Potter it in a secret place
[1:29:42] and all the people shall answer and say
[1:29:48] is all the people here
[1:29:50] are there people here
[1:29:52] let the people answer and say Amen
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:57] curse be he
[1:30:00] that's the Satellite by his father or
[1:30:04] his mother
[1:30:05] and all the people shall saying
[1:30:09] curse be he that remove his labor his
[1:30:13] neighbor's landmark and all the people
[1:30:16] shall saying amen
[1:30:19] cares be he them that maketh the blind
[1:30:23] to wander out of the way and all the
[1:30:26] people shall say
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:30] curse be he thou perverted
[1:30:33] the Judgment of the stranger the
[1:30:36] fatherless and the Widow and all the
[1:30:39] people shall Say Amen
[1:30:42] praise the Lord now the reason why I'm
[1:30:46] doing this is because
[1:30:48] you will realize Moses here is
[1:30:52] instructing the Levites on this Mount of
[1:30:56] Eva he's now
[1:30:59] presenting them the the the the curse
[1:31:02] wow why God will take his Blessing away
[1:31:06] now the thing that is powerful there is
[1:31:08] that if you just have some time and you
[1:31:12] read those last uh words of Moses you
[1:31:17] will realize that everything that the
[1:31:20] Jews went through
[1:31:22] from the time of the Roman Titus General
[1:31:25] to the time of Hitler Moses prophesied
[1:31:29] about it
[1:31:31] right here in Deuteronomy chapter 28
[1:31:33] he's tell them that if you don't if you
[1:31:37] don't keep the word of the Lord you
[1:31:39] Lord you see your own children you will
[1:31:41] go into captivity
[1:31:48] praise the Lord
[1:31:49] during the time of the Holocaust there
[1:31:51] was there was a woman
[1:31:53] that that the handsome Jews away
[1:31:57] and and the Lord blessed what she was
[1:32:00] doing
[1:32:01] and uh uh uh and and she was able to
[1:32:05] survive out of there
[1:32:08] so over over the years
[1:32:14] the Jews have had many recognition for
[1:32:17] hurting you know they were they would
[1:32:19] say to her place and
[1:32:20] so one time they were there that I I was
[1:32:24] just listening to to that story couple
[1:32:26] of weeks or maybe the month ago
[1:32:30] and there were one
[1:32:32] there were one uh uh Jew
[1:32:36] that was that was that was that was very
[1:32:38] language as they went through you know
[1:32:40] people will tell some of the Holocaust
[1:32:43] Survivors they would tell their stories
[1:32:45] and all of that
[1:32:47] and then he he stood up and said
[1:32:50] he said
[1:32:52] where was our God
[1:32:56] when our parents were going through this
[1:33:03] and everywhere were quiet
[1:33:06] he says and we read through the
[1:33:08] scripture how we went through the the
[1:33:11] the the the Captivity in Egypt we read
[1:33:15] through the Bible how we went through we
[1:33:17] suffer in the hands of the Assyrians we
[1:33:19] suffer in the hands of Babylon that we
[1:33:22] suffer in the hands of Roman how can you
[1:33:25] say that uh that that that the god
[1:33:27] Elohim is our God
[1:33:30] everywhere was quiet
[1:33:34] praise the Lord
[1:33:36] there was one old rubber
[1:33:41] stood up and said Son
[1:33:49] it's true that we went through this and
[1:33:51] we went through that and you know in
[1:33:54] Egypt and he you know he went he said
[1:33:56] all of that
[1:33:58] then he caught her from the Torah
[1:34:01] Genesis 20 I mean Deuteronomy 28.
[1:34:05] and he started to go through all of that
[1:34:09] the Lord Our God says if we will not
[1:34:11] keep the keep the Commandment these were
[1:34:14] the curses
[1:34:19] that would come upon us
[1:34:22] you know why they went into Babylon
[1:34:24] because they never gave the land it's
[1:34:27] rest
[1:34:30] they were supposed to work seven years
[1:34:33] and and leave one year
[1:34:35] six years and live one year as as a
[1:34:38] Sabbath the land was supposed to have a
[1:34:41] sabbah right
[1:34:49] praise the Lord
[1:34:50] God means what he says
[1:34:55] you were created by the word of God and
[1:34:58] God is not going to change his word
[1:35:00] to fit your present situation
[1:35:04] he means what he says
[1:35:11] praise the Lord but what I wanted you to
[1:35:13] realize here as we read this
[1:35:16] you will realize that when when the
[1:35:19] priest said this
[1:35:21] point in tall man even telling the
[1:35:24] people curse is he that will lay with a
[1:35:28] man curses he that would not respect his
[1:35:30] neighbor a landmark the people will say
[1:35:33] Amen
[1:35:35] amen and all the people were saying is
[1:35:40] the people here this morning and all the
[1:35:43] people were saying
[1:35:45] but when you come over to Genesis I mean
[1:35:48] Deuteronomy 28
[1:35:50] when Moses tell the priests
[1:35:55] to now
[1:35:58] proclaim the blessing
[1:36:02] praise the Lord look in the scripture
[1:36:06] you will realize that
[1:36:16] 20 and verse 1 and and it shall come to
[1:36:18] pass a thou
[1:36:20] if thou shall yaken diligently unto the
[1:36:24] voice
[1:36:25] of the Lord thy God to observe and do
[1:36:29] all his commitment which I commanded
[1:36:32] this thing that the Lord
[1:36:35] that God will set thee on high above all
[1:36:39] nations of the Earth
[1:36:42] amen
[1:36:44] and all these blessings shall come and
[1:36:48] be an overtake thee
[1:36:51] come on
[1:36:53] praise the Lord
[1:36:55] amen and all the blessings will come
[1:36:58] upon thee and Alma take thee and thou
[1:37:00] shall yanking onto the voice of the Lord
[1:37:03] thy God blessed shall thou be in the
[1:37:06] city and blessed shall thou be in the
[1:37:09] field
[1:37:11] but you see the people never say Amen
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:22] the people never said amen
[1:37:30] oh I know it was going to be a wow
[1:37:32] moment
[1:37:40] when the Levites
[1:37:43] proclaim the curses
[1:37:46] yeah
[1:37:47] the people said all the people said amen
[1:37:52] right
[1:37:55] when the Levi proclaim the blessing
[1:38:00] the people never say Amen
[1:38:05] praise the Lord
[1:38:07] I can have you to stand up we prayed and
[1:38:10] go home

[1:40:20] and then just have your mind working
[1:40:22] until we meet the next time but I won't
[1:40:25] do that to you amen
[1:40:28] I won't do that to you but this this
[1:40:31] particular scripture for many many many
[1:40:33] years have my mind I've cut my mind out
[1:40:38] since
[1:40:39] what what could be this
[1:40:42] you know and and I think I think
[1:40:44] recently the law kind of helped me
[1:40:46] especially when I was studying on this
[1:40:48] subject
[1:40:49] he helped me to be able to see a little
[1:40:52] bit got a little insight on on what was
[1:40:55] going on here
[1:40:58] you see God always bring his people
[1:41:01] uh uh the the the you know the the
[1:41:05] blessings of God I mean there is there
[1:41:08] is uh you know all of these all of these
[1:41:10] uh uh Prosperity Gospel you know that
[1:41:14] will make you to think that you need to
[1:41:17] do this to be blessed you need to do
[1:41:19] this to be blessed amen the Bible says
[1:41:22] when God made man he blessed him
[1:41:26] amen when God made man he blessed him
[1:41:32] praise the Lord
[1:41:35] you know what it takes for almighty God
[1:41:37] to go against his Lord to curse you
[1:41:42] yeah
[1:41:43] yeah
[1:41:47] praise the Lord
[1:41:50] he wants you to be happy
[1:41:53] he wants you to be healthy
[1:41:56] amen he wants you to always have a peace
[1:42:00] of mind
[1:42:03] like John said above everything I wish
[1:42:07] that you prosper even as your soul
[1:42:11] prosperous
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:15] that's God's desire
[1:42:17] right amen
[1:42:19] it is man's effort that brought him to
[1:42:24] the curse
[1:42:28] our effort trying to uh uh either bring
[1:42:32] the blessing quickly or go ahead of go
[1:42:34] ahead of God
[1:42:36] that bring us to this place of the curse
[1:42:42] praise the Lord
[1:42:46] now there is something important that
[1:42:48] we're going to a steady here this
[1:42:50] morning you realize that this is the
[1:42:53] place where Jesus said he made this
[1:42:57] profound statement when he said it is
[1:43:00] neither on this mountain neither on that
[1:43:02] mountain
[1:43:03] right
[1:43:05] praise the Lord
[1:43:07] but the true worshipers will worship God
[1:43:11] in spirit and in truth
[1:43:16] praise the Lord so now God is is now
[1:43:20] particular about what church and by one
[1:43:23] building God is particular about his
[1:43:27] people stepping into the place of
[1:43:29] worship stepping into his choosing place
[1:43:32] of worship His chosen place of worship
[1:43:35] is not a building it's not on a brand
[1:43:38] name
[1:43:43] praise the Lord
[1:43:45] because those places one one mountain
[1:43:48] kept us under the curse Another Mountain
[1:43:51] uh try to bring us into an overnight
[1:43:55] blessing
[1:43:57] churches find themselves right in the
[1:43:59] valley of soccer
[1:44:02] with the religious word that is before
[1:44:04] them
[1:44:05] amen one system from the Roman Church
[1:44:09] and all of his daughters and keeping the
[1:44:12] church under the curse
[1:44:14] right amen
[1:44:16] and then we have another character
[1:44:19] movement now that there are standard
[1:44:21] Prosperity Gospel right
[1:44:28] praise the Lord yes sir
[1:44:33] but let's study this together
[1:44:35] and all about this who have caught your
[1:44:37] attention and this will be the breaking
[1:44:39] point I can I can drive the nail right
[1:44:41] right on this amen
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:50] now so
[1:44:52] God brings the people to this place
[1:44:55] okay
[1:44:57] and he's asking the levite after all the
[1:45:01] the the the the curses will be
[1:45:03] proclaimed to the people let the people
[1:45:06] respond and says amen and what does Amen
[1:45:10] means
[1:45:12] so be it be it unto me yeah yeah if I
[1:45:15] don't keep your word
[1:45:19] let that be upon me let that be upon my
[1:45:22] children let her be upon me
[1:45:33] praise the Lord amen hallelujah and it's
[1:45:37] completely different when I was thinking
[1:45:39] about this study because uh uh uh when
[1:45:42] you come to that place of of of of of of
[1:45:45] of of of
[1:45:46] menstruating you know and telling the
[1:45:49] people how you know how the Lord will
[1:45:51] bless you and prosper you and we can all
[1:45:53] say Amen to that
[1:45:55] but when you get on the nail and then
[1:45:57] start by the the evangelists come and
[1:45:59] start rebuking the people you know and
[1:46:01] calling our sin the whole church go
[1:46:04] quiet we get the whole thing reversed
[1:46:08] praise the Lord when the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:11] rebuking us that's what we're supposed
[1:46:13] to be saying amen praise the Lord Jesus
[1:46:16] speak that to me
[1:46:23] praise the Lord
[1:46:26] but we get the whole thing reverse
[1:46:30] we go quiet
[1:46:35] when the Holy Ghost is rebuking us we
[1:46:37] get offended
[1:46:43] we take some sense of comfort when we
[1:46:45] when we're hearing about blessing and we
[1:46:48] will be prosperity and how the law will
[1:46:50] be with us we take some sense of comfort
[1:46:53] right
[1:46:54] never be with me this day
[1:47:00] praise the Lord
[1:47:01] but God approach is different
[1:47:05] because God
[1:47:06] primary purpose his purpose his desire
[1:47:09] for his children is so blessing
[1:47:14] God don't have to go into any agreement
[1:47:17] to bless you right
[1:47:21] but he brings you into an agreement that
[1:47:24] if you don't keep my word
[1:47:26] this is going to happen to you
[1:47:28] and when it's happening to you you must
[1:47:31] realize it's because of your own failure
[1:47:37] you can't say God why everybody is there
[1:47:41] why why is this happening you must look
[1:47:43] at yourself
[1:47:48] he's saying let it greet upon this
[1:47:53] if you remove your your your neighbor
[1:47:56] lean back
[1:47:57] there's a curse that is going to come
[1:47:59] upon you
[1:48:02] because that is that is something that
[1:48:04] you must not do
[1:48:06] yeah praise the Lord
[1:48:08] do you always feel like
[1:48:12] you know it's it's always it's it's it's
[1:48:13] it's it's it's in parenting it's a blind
[1:48:16] spot
[1:48:17] it's a blind spot it's imperative it's
[1:48:20] it's a marriage relationship it almost
[1:48:22] looks like uh uh when we are doing well
[1:48:25] we are never praise
[1:48:29] it's just all it just it just it just
[1:48:31] when we make mistake right that you talk
[1:48:34] about it
[1:48:36] if there's something that is in a blind
[1:48:38] spot
[1:48:39] amen we must be able to affirm when
[1:48:42] people are doing well we must we we must
[1:48:45] encourage them to do well but you see
[1:48:47] the reason why stocked on those things
[1:48:49] are in the in in a blind spot is because
[1:48:53] we are expected to do well
[1:48:56] right that's that is what is expected of
[1:48:59] us
[1:48:59] yes praise the Lord
[1:49:02] that's the reason why I always fall like
[1:49:05] that that is whenever you are stepping
[1:49:08] stepping out then you know somebody will
[1:49:10] say something about it right because you
[1:49:14] are not expected to go in the wrong path
[1:49:16] you are not expected to say the wrong
[1:49:19] thing
[1:49:20] what is suspected of you is or we can't
[1:49:24] wait for the days for the Millennium to
[1:49:26] come amen when Satan is Bound for a
[1:49:28] thousand years praise the Lord
[1:49:30] Hallelujah you will not have to worry
[1:49:33] about making mistake because you will
[1:49:35] not make mistake
[1:49:37] you will not have to worry I mean if you
[1:49:40] have to think twice before you say the
[1:49:42] truth you will not have to think twice
[1:49:44] the truth will flow out of your mouth
[1:49:48] because Satan will be bound for a
[1:49:51] thousand years
[1:49:56] are we together
[1:49:58] so do you grab the picture
[1:50:00] wow the people were required to say Amen
[1:50:04] to another curses
[1:50:10] praise the Lord
[1:50:12] Hallelujah
[1:50:17] I believe that uh that is the way they
[1:50:20] must be to the True Believer
[1:50:23] when God speaks to us and he rebuked us
[1:50:26] we must be Lord help me
[1:50:29] praise the Lord Lord help me because I
[1:50:32] know you are calling me to a higher
[1:50:35] height amen you are calling me to a
[1:50:37] better life
[1:50:38] and blessed is he that is now offended
[1:50:40] in me
[1:50:43] blessed is he that will not take offense
[1:50:45] in the word
[1:50:49] because the word does not come to offend
[1:50:51] you no
[1:50:53] the world comes to make you better
[1:51:02] are we together
[1:51:05] so let's go now into into dealing with
[1:51:08] this with this uh with this mountain if
[1:51:11] uh if uh the Saints back there can just
[1:51:15] put my little map up here
[1:51:20] praise the Lord
[1:51:28] if they can put our map up
[1:51:31] here
[1:51:33] okay
[1:51:37] so you see the I don't have my my point
[1:51:40] in stone here but you see
[1:51:45] here is Samara up there
[1:51:47] and here's the two mountains
[1:51:50] and Jesus and this woman was right down
[1:51:53] here
[1:51:55] in this Valley of shashim
[1:51:58] so right there in the valley they were
[1:52:00] looking at the two mountains
[1:52:05] they are looking at Mount Eva and
[1:52:08] they're looking at Mount Garrison
[1:52:10] man Garrison was supposed to be the
[1:52:13] mountain of blessing
[1:52:15] maniba was supposed to be the mountain
[1:52:17] of curse
[1:52:19] another thing I want you to watch
[1:52:22] in the scripture year
[1:52:24] is that there was not an altar built in
[1:52:29] mangerezi
[1:52:33] praise the Lord
[1:52:35] because I know how to use this fence I
[1:52:37] think
[1:52:45] okay
[1:52:48] brother Jordan can you come and save me
[1:52:56] okay yes yes this one is much easier
[1:53:00] than that one
[1:53:02] okay yeah this one is much easier I
[1:53:05] won't get too much button
[1:53:11] now so
[1:53:13] yeah our mountains we are right here
[1:53:16] and then if you look at this you'll
[1:53:17] realize that there are a lot of
[1:53:19] mountains Here Mount Nimble my calendar
[1:53:21] with uh uh Elijah and all of that but
[1:53:25] this is right here where we are we are
[1:53:27] right here
[1:53:30] this this will kind of bring out the the
[1:53:33] picture better for you now another thing
[1:53:36] I want us to realize when you go back
[1:53:38] again to chapter
[1:53:41] 27. now these things were written for us
[1:53:44] yeah
[1:53:46] the New Testament does not come into a
[1:53:49] full light
[1:53:50] until we see the things that God bless
[1:53:53] you
[1:53:56] praise the Lord yeah
[1:54:00] now
[1:54:01] so you'll realize in Mao in in in
[1:54:05] chapter 27 in Mount Eva
[1:54:09] God told
[1:54:11] Moses
[1:54:13] foreign
[1:54:16] if you if if we read which of course we
[1:54:20] just read there the Bible says in verse
[1:54:23] 4 of 27
[1:54:26] therefore
[1:54:27] it shall be when they go over job and
[1:54:30] take the stones in Mount EBA and plaster
[1:54:34] it and verse 5 the Bible says and there
[1:54:37] shall you build an altar
[1:54:41] so there is an altar that is built in
[1:54:45] Mount evil and on the altar verse 6 Thou
[1:54:49] shalt build the altar of the Lord thy
[1:54:52] God of whole stones and thou shall offer
[1:54:56] burn offering thereon and thou shall
[1:54:59] offer peace offering but if you go to
[1:55:02] chapter 28 when you read about uh man
[1:55:06] Garrison there was no altar that was
[1:55:08] built on my jersey
[1:55:10] [Music]
[1:55:14] praise the Lord
[1:55:17] amen
[1:55:18] there was no altar that was built now it
[1:55:23] brings also to light
[1:55:26] for us to understand what is the order
[1:55:30] for
[1:55:33] praise the Lord
[1:55:36] the first altar that was built was built
[1:55:39] in Eden
[1:55:41] and almighty God himself build that
[1:55:44] altar
[1:55:46] when he took alarm
[1:55:49] and slay the line
[1:55:51] and he was going to bring his children
[1:55:54] back into Fellowship
[1:56:00] so you see the altar is built to deal
[1:56:04] with the curse
[1:56:07] sir
[1:56:10] praise the Lord
[1:56:11] the altar is built to deed with the
[1:56:15] curse
[1:56:18] that's the reason why the altar was in
[1:56:22] the mountain of curse
[1:56:27] praise the Lord
[1:56:29] when we get on the other side and into
[1:56:31] Glory we want to have no evangelists who
[1:56:34] have no preacher will not need
[1:56:36] missionary
[1:56:38] right we will all worship the land amen
[1:56:41] praise the lord we will all worship the
[1:56:44] land this is word we need the preaching
[1:56:47] of the word
[1:56:55] now so you see here as as we look at
[1:56:59] this together
[1:57:00] now it gave us the picture here
[1:57:05] come here read some things to you
[1:57:09] okay I'm almost getting out of time here
[1:57:12] I read some things to you
[1:57:17] uh let's see so we go through our
[1:57:19] subject yeah
[1:57:21] now so
[1:57:22] it brings us to the place where the the
[1:57:26] this this this this uh uh uh
[1:57:29] predestinated seed
[1:57:31] uh uh future home uh he said that that
[1:57:36] Samaritan woman had a predestinated
[1:57:38] seeing her amen it was a predestinated
[1:57:41] sea that was quickened in heard that
[1:57:43] made her to say I perceive that you are
[1:57:46] a prophet
[1:57:48] praise the Lord
[1:57:49] why all of those priests and sahidras
[1:57:52] council could not see it but that woman
[1:57:55] with the with the condition of her life
[1:57:58] praise the Lord she's going through all
[1:58:01] of this confusion she having a
[1:58:03] relationship confusion she having
[1:58:06] religion confusion she even had a
[1:58:09] confusion with her whole people that she
[1:58:12] that she have to come out in a certain
[1:58:14] time of the day she's dealing with all
[1:58:17] of this confusion
[1:58:19] but down in her sword is a predestinated
[1:58:22] sea
[1:58:25] praise the Lord
[1:58:26] down in her sword is a predestinated
[1:58:29] seed and what she needed is the word to
[1:58:31] break the curse
[1:58:33] she needs a word to break the curse for
[1:58:35] that seed to come to life
[1:58:37] [Music]
[1:58:43] praise the Lord
[1:58:46] Hallelujah
[1:58:48] you appreciate the Lord
[1:58:50] let's give the Lord a hand of praise
[1:58:55] glory be to God
[1:59:00] [Applause]
[1:59:03] glory be to God
[1:59:06] now so
[1:59:08] Jesus yet is addressing this woman she
[1:59:12] said I perceive that you are a prophet
[1:59:15] and she jumped into her religious shoes
[1:59:17] our father said it's on this mountain
[1:59:20] Garrison
[1:59:22] that we must worship you say this in
[1:59:24] Jerusalem
[1:59:27] but he said the hour has come
[1:59:31] praise the Lord the hour has come I
[1:59:35] don't know whether you have come into
[1:59:36] that hour yet maybe you are still on
[1:59:39] your mind Garrison or your man Eva but
[1:59:42] Jesus said that hour has come
[1:59:47] praise the Lord oh I hope the hour can
[1:59:50] break upon us this morning I hope the
[1:59:53] hour can break upon us this morning
[1:59:54] because people have got so stuck into
[1:59:57] those mountains
[1:59:59] that no matter how the word is the the
[2:00:02] abrilian spirit is so stuck that they
[2:00:05] cannot bring praise to God
[2:00:08] amen we either have to go on the mount
[2:00:11] ever with them
[2:00:13] and play the music of Mount ever and
[2:00:16] even if you out there with them they
[2:00:17] were still not praise God
[2:00:20] because God is not going to receive
[2:00:22] those Praises on the curse
[2:00:27] amen he's not going to receive the the
[2:00:31] the the the the the the uh the worship
[2:00:34] for my Garrison they don't even have any
[2:00:36] hotter
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:41] they have a promise but they don't have
[2:00:43] an altar
[2:00:45] and we cannot worship without an altar
[2:00:51] but the hour has come
[2:00:55] the hour has come
[2:00:58] I praise the Lord
[2:01:01] amen that's why the son of man Ministry
[2:01:04] is to do is to bring us into the hour of
[2:01:08] true worship
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:12] is to take us out of our tradition our
[2:01:15] starchiness
[2:01:16] [Music]

[2:01:21] instrument you have everything but yeah
[2:01:23] we cannot bring worship to God right man
[2:01:32] the hour has come me praise the Lord

[2:01:39] abroad they are predestinate as he into
[2:01:42] true worship

[2:02:33] very same ground where God met Abraham
[2:02:35] the first time amen the first place that
[2:02:39] Abraham built an altar
[2:02:44] there was no church building
[2:02:48] praise the Lord
[2:02:50] Abraham just came out of idolatry just
[2:02:53] came out of Babylon
[2:02:56] God there with his heart
[2:02:59] he built an altar amen and he worshiped

[2:04:02] lead up our church crease or our
[2:04:04] denominational status the hour has come
[2:04:09] all of those things
[2:04:11] that's what broad generation conflict
[2:04:14] upon us
[2:04:15] when one group think they are better
[2:04:17] than another group
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:23] praise the Lord all this is why we
[2:04:25] believe all that is why we believe
[2:04:27] and with all of that we have not been
[2:04:29] able to bring worship
[2:04:33] we have not been able to bring worship
[2:04:35] yes
[2:04:37] if we are worshiping God why should why
[2:04:39] should you be offended in the music
[2:04:41] right it's God that's supposed to be
[2:04:43] offended why should you be offended
[2:04:47] yes sir
[2:04:48] when your worship is on to God you pass
[2:04:51] the music you go into the holy place
[2:04:55] [Applause]
[2:05:05] I'm not making excuses for my poor voice
[2:05:07] amen and I'm making excuses when I spoil
[2:05:11] the song
[2:05:12] right praise the Lord
[2:05:15] but I'm trying to say is that the hour
[2:05:17] has come
[2:05:19] the hour is upon us
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:24] praise the Lord
[2:05:30] who are the true worshipers
[2:05:33] will worship the father
[2:05:35] in spirit
[2:05:38] any truth
[2:05:40] praise the Lord
[2:05:42] where the truth worshipers will worship
[2:05:45] the father
[2:05:47] a spirit
[2:05:49] and in truth
[2:05:55] Hallelujah
[2:05:57] are we together
[2:06:00] we are just read a couple of things here
[2:06:02] we can pick this up another time there's
[2:06:05] some other few things that we have loved
[2:06:07] to go into
[2:06:09] but time is that much on my side
[2:06:16] I don't care how many how much time you
[2:06:19] give me I will never be able to preach
[2:06:20] finish my message
[2:06:24] because I'm such a poor preacher amen
[2:06:27] not very organized like some uh
[2:06:31] glory be to God
[2:06:37] because of this this generation conflict
[2:06:41] because of all of this conflict
[2:06:45] that came right down from our birth that
[2:06:47] runs into our genetics
[2:06:50] you know have all become part of
[2:06:52] religious conflict in all of the things
[2:06:54] that we deal with
[2:06:57] praise the Lord
[2:07:00] it has put us to the place
[2:07:05] word
[2:07:08] when man comes to worship
[2:07:12] many of the times
[2:07:14] we come with this concept on our mind
[2:07:17] wanting God to bless the things that we
[2:07:20] are doing
[2:07:21] right
[2:07:23] amen
[2:07:25] praise the Lord
[2:07:28] which of course also is a vehicle that
[2:07:30] is moving in reverse
[2:07:34] because we must do the things that God
[2:07:37] is blessing
[2:07:39] yes sir
[2:07:43] praise the Lord
[2:07:45] we must do the things we must be able to
[2:07:48] identify what God is doing
[2:07:51] right
[2:07:55] praise the Lord
[2:07:59] but the people come with the mindset
[2:08:04] wanting God to bless the things that we
[2:08:07] are doing
[2:08:12] praise the Lord
[2:08:19] instead of identifying what God is doing
[2:08:23] or what God is blessing
[2:08:27] even in your own life
[2:08:30] and in your own family
[2:08:32] and in your own home
[2:08:37] to do what God is blessing
[2:08:46] praise the Lord
[2:08:58] people
[2:09:00] across from Christ
[2:09:04] is the mystery of God revealed I've
[2:09:06] always loved this this statement he saw
[2:09:09] is this this has been
[2:09:12] uh when I when I really started
[2:09:15] understanding
[2:09:16] that this this has been very outstanding
[2:09:19] to me for a long time
[2:09:22] what brings me here or what brings us
[2:09:24] here is you people see this church I
[2:09:27] tell you all this place I've I've I've
[2:09:31] went ever in my life all places that
[2:09:33] whenever in my life this is the February
[2:09:35] place to come preach the gospel
[2:09:38] and and look like that we can make tips
[2:09:42] from here
[2:09:43] 10 times better than anything but this
[2:09:46] is what has stuck out to me see
[2:09:50] that's the reason I said
[2:09:52] where God is doing something
[2:09:55] then stay right there
[2:09:58] stay right with that
[2:10:03] what God is doing what he's blessing
[2:10:08] that's what you have to look for
[2:10:15] that's what you have to look for
[2:10:23] any young people in a path of career
[2:10:28] it's not just wages
[2:10:33] it's not just how many money we can make
[2:10:37] because you can make all of the money
[2:10:39] and then you start being enslaved by the
[2:10:41] money
[2:10:43] but you have to watch for what God is
[2:10:46] doing
[2:10:50] if he's making you a blessing on the job
[2:10:55] and you realize that you are carrying
[2:10:58] his presence
[2:11:00] if you identify that that I have a
[2:11:03] purpose here
[2:11:12] you find people that jump from one place
[2:11:14] to another not on a job but people that
[2:11:16] run from one city to another for the
[2:11:18] church that goes to this place looking
[2:11:20] for the best church when they get there
[2:11:22] the church is no more good for them
[2:11:24] right amen especially in the streaming
[2:11:27] environment that we have they sit online
[2:11:29] they stream all the service is beautiful
[2:11:31] the service is beautiful
[2:11:33] when the people are online they are all
[2:11:36] injuries
[2:11:38] praise the Lord they are all Angels
[2:11:41] because you don't get a feeling with
[2:11:42] them you don't feel them you don't feed
[2:11:45] their vibe
[2:11:47] they're all angels
[2:11:49] but when you come down and walk into the
[2:11:51] congregation then you realize oh I've
[2:11:53] been looking at humans all of this one
[2:11:59] praise the Lord
[2:12:00] right you find people just in this
[2:12:03] Wilderness condition moving from one
[2:12:06] place to another
[2:12:08] they can never settle down
[2:12:10] why because they have not identified
[2:12:12] what God is doing
[2:12:14] they are looking for what they will do
[2:12:16] that God will bless don't bring God in a
[2:12:19] reverse right
[2:12:23] are you telling me there is nothing that
[2:12:25] God is blessing on the Earth
[2:12:27] until what you will be doing
[2:12:36] find what he's doing identify stay with
[2:12:39] it
[2:12:40] yes sir
[2:12:45] and God will bless you
[2:12:48] because you have already identified what
[2:12:50] he's doing you are already blessed you
[2:12:53] are already it's a blessing it's already
[2:12:55] there right
[2:12:57] right it will just start unfolding
[2:13:00] it will start opening to you
[2:13:03] it's there
[2:13:04] the blessings of God is all around us
[2:13:20] find what he's doing
[2:13:25] is he making you a blessing to the
[2:13:27] people are the people are blessing to
[2:13:29] you
[2:13:33] praise the Lord
[2:13:38] no because we we we we get into this
[2:13:41] place of of of of of where we want to be
[2:13:44] safe
[2:13:46] we don't want to get our hands dirty we
[2:13:48] don't want to be servants
[2:13:52] sure
[2:13:55] so we sit back and just like getting to
[2:13:58] the restaurant you sit there on the
[2:13:59] table not realizing that you met
[2:14:01] hundreds of people sitting down
[2:14:04] and when they can't get up to you you
[2:14:06] get up you slander the menu on the table
[2:14:08] and you walk out
[2:14:12] I've been sitting there all of this wine
[2:14:15] sure
[2:14:16] press one if you would just talked to
[2:14:19] one of the stewards pretty soon you
[2:14:21] realize how busy they are
[2:14:22] maybe there is one man behind there that
[2:14:24] is cooking
[2:14:27] and all of these people are waiting for
[2:14:29] their food
[2:14:33] We Gather you just slam the table and
[2:14:38] go home and cook for yourself
[2:14:42] sure
[2:14:44] but you see that's the mentality of the
[2:14:46] people because we want to be safe
[2:14:51] they don't create no passion in us for
[2:14:54] us to bear with people
[2:14:58] that they are not doing it right but
[2:14:59] they are doing something
[2:15:01] sir
[2:15:18] praise the Lord
[2:15:21] father seek as such
[2:15:24] to worship Him
[2:15:27] the father seeketh such to worship Him
[2:15:30] yes
[2:15:31] praise the Lord
[2:15:32] that we worship Him in spirit and in
[2:15:35] truth
[2:15:36] people have we realized that have we
[2:15:40] realized
[2:15:42] out of these years we have just been
[2:15:44] building one other denomination
[2:15:48] they're listening to the voice of the
[2:15:50] son of man calling us to the hour of
[2:15:54] true worship
[2:15:56] calling us to the hour what is the hour
[2:15:58] of true worship
[2:16:00] is the hour where you were delivered
[2:16:03] your true representation
[2:16:05] yes that you are a son of God and you
[2:16:08] have to live like a son of God
[2:16:10] you have to dress like a son of God
[2:16:13] right
[2:16:14] [Music]
[2:16:16] you're right amen
[2:16:23] do we realize that
[2:16:28] praise the Lord
[2:16:33] Hebrew exposition
[2:16:35] I read this and if we can get through it
[2:16:38] then we close
[2:16:41] we all to give the most and it's heed
[2:16:45] to the things
[2:16:47] which we have heard
[2:16:49] that's why Paul said
[2:16:52] the things which we have heard
[2:16:55] we have to give the most Earnest heed
[2:17:00] we have to yell ourselves to that right
[2:17:05] not not make something out of what we
[2:17:07] have heard all of these years we've been
[2:17:10] making things
[2:17:11] out of what we have heard that's why
[2:17:14] gave us all of the different doctrines
[2:17:18] because we take one chord and one
[2:17:21] scripture and we try to make a Doctrine
[2:17:23] yeah why we are better than them
[2:17:28] we have to heed give it
[2:17:32] surround ourself
[2:17:35] to the things
[2:17:36] that we have heard
[2:17:38] because there's a voice that is calling
[2:17:41] us
[2:17:42] calling us at an hour of Truth worship
[2:17:49] why type of people
[2:17:52] are we to be when we see
[2:17:54] the great Jehovah come down
[2:17:57] and do the things that he does
[2:18:01] praise the Lord
[2:18:07] honor the time of the Revival and all of
[2:18:09] these Great Men
[2:18:12] praise the Lord
[2:18:16] so see the things that he have done
[2:18:20] that we are not serving a dead God we
[2:18:22] are serving a living God that is among
[2:18:25] his people
[2:18:28] praise the Lord
[2:18:30] but rolling the young man preaching
[2:18:33] there he was just he was testifying
[2:18:35] about uh uh uh uh a situation there down
[2:18:39] in in in South Carolina

[2:18:47] Lord that in South Carolina this young
[2:18:49] man grew on under the message
[2:18:52] Fair frustrated
[2:18:55] and gave his and gave himself over to a
[2:18:58] trans life
[2:19:01] praise the Lord lost his identity and
[2:19:04] becoming something else
[2:19:05] and one night he will have a dream
[2:19:09] of being in the tribulation
[2:19:12] a dream that troubled him so much
[2:19:15] that when he woke up from sleep
[2:19:19] you see it's it's not how loud we preach
[2:19:23] and Shout at you
[2:19:25] is how much this world can get down to
[2:19:27] your heart how much this work and get
[2:19:30] down to your soul
[2:19:36] he woke up from sleep with a sweat all
[2:19:39] over his body
[2:19:41] and everything that he heard in church
[2:19:43] from a little boy starts to play back to
[2:19:46] his mind
[2:19:51] praise the Lord
[2:19:54] came back to church rededicate his heart
[2:19:57] back to the Lord
[2:19:59] yeah and God delivered him
[2:20:03] of that perverted spirit
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:07] praise the Lord not letting God stay
[2:20:10] here Among Us
[2:20:18] if we would just give heed
[2:20:21] to the face
[2:20:23] not be smart on the things that we have
[2:20:25] heard
[2:20:27] but give heed to the things that we have
[2:20:29] heard
[2:20:38] what type of people are we to be
[2:20:42] the secret Jehovah come down and do the
[2:20:44] things that he does and see them
[2:20:47] comparing scripture with scripture
[2:20:51] and a little bit that we can do try to
[2:20:54] do this morning
[2:20:55] bring you right back into the foundation
[2:20:57] this is the foundation
[2:21:02] of Saint John chapter 4.
[2:21:05] you can read it and queen it all the
[2:21:07] ways you want to acquaint it but take it
[2:21:09] back
[2:21:11] take it back to the to its original
[2:21:15] Moses they're instructing the people
[2:21:17] giving them his last words
[2:21:25] that they
[2:21:27] comparing scripture with scripture that
[2:21:29] they are the truth and we sit around
[2:21:32] sometimes
[2:21:34] watch on the Lord
[2:21:37] and just so all concerned
[2:21:41] unconcerned
[2:21:45] and yet
[2:21:47] we think that we are worshiping God
[2:21:52] praise the Lord
[2:21:54] and sometimes when the Holy Ghost try to
[2:21:57] call a person out
[2:22:00] we get offended by that
[2:22:08] with the time that we are living in all
[2:22:10] of the things that is happening around
[2:22:12] us how can we be unconcerned
[2:22:16] about our spiritual life how can we be
[2:22:18] all concerned about our family life
[2:22:21] right how can we be your own concerned
[2:22:25] about even the Church of the Living God
[2:22:31] how can we be all concerned
[2:22:36] when we know that it's not getting
[2:22:38] better
[2:22:42] praise the Lord
[2:22:51] we have never had a time in the word
[2:23:02] where the word has been occupied by a
[2:23:04] bunch of scammers
[2:23:07] right
[2:23:08] praise the Lord
[2:23:09] scare me people right from the pulpit
[2:23:12] scamming people in the hospital
[2:23:15] amen
[2:23:17] a young man down there in Florida I got
[2:23:19] some kind of a fake degree never been
[2:23:21] out of high school
[2:23:22] preacher doctor degree who rented a
[2:23:24] place and wrote run in a clinic
[2:23:29] praise the Lord
[2:23:35] a group of of hard-working people
[2:23:40] That Base came of all their retirement
[2:23:43] because somebody told them you can skip
[2:23:46] your money in gold
[2:23:50] and they send their money to him he's
[2:23:52] over in Dubai
[2:23:55] it's not funny
[2:24:00] it's not funny it's a spirit
[2:24:03] because if you have not got your money
[2:24:05] it's robbing you of the presence of God
[2:24:22] so with all of these things how can we
[2:24:24] set just being unconcerned
[2:24:30] all of the things that is in that that
[2:24:32] is now being introduced into schools
[2:24:35] how can we sit there and be unconcerned
[2:24:42] not working with our children not not
[2:24:44] involving them
[2:24:59] we ought to be busy at every minute
[2:25:03] trying to get people to Christ
[2:25:07] we ought to be lifeless stones
[2:25:13] we should never be satisfied like we are
[2:25:18] praise the Lord
[2:25:20] we must always challenge ourselves
[2:25:25] always challenge ourselves
[2:25:29] praise the Lord
[2:25:32] how just following the knowledge
[2:25:34] documentary or for the progression
[2:25:37] of all of these uh uh our DNA think
[2:25:41] over there in Iceland they having one of
[2:25:45] the biggest DNA accompanied
[2:25:48] and now they have come up with a DNA
[2:25:50] research that can tell you when you
[2:25:53] would die
[2:25:56] and what you may die of
[2:26:04] it should not surprise you
[2:26:06] because we're carrying death in this
[2:26:08] body yes sir it's there it's just that
[2:26:11] you don't know when it will just cut you
[2:26:12] off but is it when you are dragging it
[2:26:14] every day right so it must not surprise
[2:26:18] you
[2:26:19] the same way they can read your
[2:26:21] bloodstream and tell where your family
[2:26:23] coming from now they are reading the
[2:26:25] bloodstream to see our sicknesses that
[2:26:28] runs through your bloodstream and what
[2:26:31] may cause your death
[2:26:33] right
[2:26:35] you see and all of these people in a
[2:26:37] science World in their mind
[2:26:40] in their mind is that we can make the
[2:26:43] world better
[2:26:46] because they said it's not to scare
[2:26:49] people but if you can do the test and
[2:26:51] know why may cause your death you can
[2:26:54] start working on it right
[2:27:01] at least they are trying to do something
[2:27:03] to to help Humanity to help the people
[2:27:06] that believe in it
[2:27:07] [Music]
[2:27:09] now we can sit there and just be
[2:27:11] criticizing everything
[2:27:13] and you don't have nothing in your heads
[2:27:17] we don't have nothing in our hands
[2:27:23] what are we doing to make the world
[2:27:25] better even for our children
[2:27:28] right
[2:27:42] praise the Lord and the people say
[2:27:45] and the people say
[2:27:48] [Music]
[2:27:50] we should never be slothful like we are
[2:27:55] and we'll go up to church
[2:27:57] and we will see the Lord Jesus do
[2:27:59] something or bless us in such a way
[2:28:03] and we will go back out and say very
[2:28:06] nice meeting I enjoy the service
[2:28:09] and that's where it stopped
[2:28:14] I enjoy the service that's where it
[2:28:16] stopped
[2:28:21] praise the Lord
[2:28:23] instead of taking that word
[2:28:29] it's the Lord Jesus you bless me in here
[2:28:32] you spoke to me here
[2:28:34] I believe I can Rise Above This right
[2:28:41] now the preaching of the word
[2:28:44] we enjoyed I'm I should close here now
[2:28:47] but that's not the me thing
[2:28:50] we should not Worship the Lord just
[2:28:52] after we get through preaching the word
[2:28:54] as we usually do just worship him that's
[2:28:58] wonderful but we should worship him
[2:29:00] every hour of our life
[2:29:05] when we are at work we should worship
[2:29:08] Him
[2:29:09] praise the Lord
[2:29:12] every time the opportunity to presents
[2:29:15] itself Worship the Lord
[2:29:17] by testifying
[2:29:19] of him
[2:29:21] praise the Lord
[2:29:26] when that woman got caught
[2:29:29] when she got captured by the son of man
[2:29:32] Ministry
[2:29:33] she worshiped him
[2:29:35] by saying come and see the man
[2:29:38] that told me all the things she was not
[2:29:41] ashamed of her testimony
[2:29:43] she was bringing worship to him yes yes
[2:29:46] all the things that I've done
