when we remember where the lord took us from we can do nothing but sing glory hallelujah since that holy ghost fire came down and rescue us amen the lord bless you you may have your seat for the little why praise the lord we have uh a lot of thanks here sister biller uh sending a lot of things from her brother there in nairobi that traveled safely asked us to pray for him he wanted to be grateful to let us know that he traveled safely and one of the other sisters we pray for there she's doing well and the brother that was paralyzed he's out of the hospital he's walking with a king but he's recovering amen praise the lord so god stay answer prayer praise the lord and we want to thank the lord for that there's a brother brother simon we were praying for from cevillian he was over in algeria on the missions trip and he got caught there and he was able to travel by road through through the desert it was a kind of a rough and dangerous trip for him but he sent me the mail yesterday to let us know that he got home safely and he met his family safe so we thank the lord for that praise the lord amen and uh brother walker from from liberia called earlier this week or somebody last week i spoke with him it's been a while that i spoke with them and after we been working with them for the little baiting and but i've been hearing everything that's been going on there but the prada is working closely with them but the lord has been gracious to them in in the area he wanted to give me some report of the the growth of the church and also the work in that area and and the lord has has been able to bless the work in that area right now he's running between [Music] i think his church or five different churches in the area he's running between now and and then when he called me last week they have started a little radio broadcast and there is another uh preacher of the denomination that have been following the radio so he was going to be leaving the next day to preach for them because the man has come down over to the church follow some of the service he and his wife and and a group of them from the church were going to be baptized amen so we want to thank the law for the growth of the work in that area praise the lord the brothers so i abandoned them but i told them no i just wanted to be quiet for a while amen and and just look at some few things around myself and uh so uh uh those are the the praise report that we have tonight but then uh experiencing some pain in his back he's gonna do an mri this evening that's why he and his family are not in church you want us to remember him in prayer and [Music] i don't want to go blank here now praise the lord but that is a prayer request that i have okay this is what i wanted to say next week as we were hoping that we will we will have a convenient service towards the end of the week we will announce how the service will be maybe by sunday or wednesday but uh what is omaha is that we have to realize that as as a people and also as a nation we are facing an election in this oncoming week we're not preaching politics we are not campaigning for any party besides jesus party amen but the the truth about the matter that is that this is where we live amen and being christians filled with the holy ghost there is no way we can escape what would become the outcome of the election so we want to pray and the thing about it there is the other you know whoever that that uh that god allowed to be there he's going to be the man that is going to be driven by by prophecy that's what i believe amen because prophecy is the one driving our time but there is just a lot of unrest there is i mean there is just a lot of things in the air and and and you know brother branham says god plays certain things set in power in the church the church is the moon that reflects the light of the sun the sun controls the bottom life the flower the trees and all of the earth the moon control the life under the sea under the sea all those things that are in the dark areas that you can see those powers are controlled by the church amen so uh uh i want us to just just pray them you know as individuals and we having loved ones we have uh relatives that are not safe they are not born again they don't have the holy ghost and uh and what whatever is going to happen you know they will have a way of looking at it but as church as believers as christians even as the word of god required us to pray for our leaders we just want to just pray that god would give us this this peace you know i mean the fear the the all the propaganda whatever on the media all of those things will not affect us because we are looking to a kingdom to come amen we know that his kid income his will be done that's what we believe in but we just want to we just want to uh applaud our hearts and pray and we're going to do a little bit of that saturday night if we have to meet here for communion we will also pray that god would just have his way amen that's that's where we want to be we want the lord to have his way and he should be able to guide us and and just keep us under the shadow of his wings just like he's been doing so let's just buy our house together we have these free few prayer requests we want to put before the lord tonight remember brother dan and uh let's just pray that god would just be i heard that was

thank you lord [Music] so rich and free i want to thank you lord for saving my soul [Music] yes [Music] praise the lord thank you musicians let me have your seat praise the lord good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen i want to start tonight by just reading a quote from jehovah jairo i was i was i had a thought on speaking on the on the little subject has been on my heart for the wednesday night but uh this thought tonight caught my attention uh after the service on sunday we had a little time of prayer and one of our sister came up and she needed a prayer for her child and we prayed and i woke up this morning early this morning and to have some time of praying and after i got to praying i went back in the room and started playing the message jehovah jarrah because of what i was on my heart i wanted to talk about and i hope that we'll have the grace to be able to talk about it as the lord will will lead us and then i was listening to the message and then while listening there brother branham said this i want to re read this to you he said jehovah jarrah he says and in the room a vision came and i went to the table where the sisters were sitting present noun was i said i saw a vision of a little girl just about so high long-headed and and she's destined to die today in a wreck in a black automobile i said he had told me to pray for the child that this will be bypass i want to take that again i saw the vision of a little girl just about so high blonde headed and she was destined to die today in a wreck in a black automobile i said in here and he told me to pray for the child that this will be bypassed and i said and and i have i said it's thus said the lord you will hear your year of it in the next two or three days and the same hour the lovely little girl of that home was out in an automobile world just barely escaped death was brought back safely how our heavenly father just marvelous then we were sitting uh just a while ago and talking about it those things happen all the time and different things amen so uh uh and it caught my attention because uh i was i was once again i was going over uh uh you know when and remembering the need that the sister mentioned to me and praying about it and then uh i went there lied down trying to to meditate on the word and and and listening to brother branham and he and he said this and for some reason it just kind of caught my spirit so uh uh i think i noted it or something like that and and kept on listening to message and and did different things and then i came by uh at church and uh to study it and prayed a little bit and i said let me read that again and when i read it the word bypass caught my mind i want to talk tonight on a great bypass the word bypass caught my mind let me read another uh quote from hebrew the message hebrew chapter seven brother branham said listen to this and i thank you you and my we all we appreciate it he said coming true illinois and made a little slight turn not noticing that the sun was behind us instead of from us we was glory enough instead of south the first thing you know cross a road i said this on the right road look down there and come to find out we were 50 miles out of the way going right straight back then when we come back we were talking i said you know why the lord might have bypassed us this way to keep us from having a horrible accident down here somewhere that that might have done something otherwise we know that all things work together for good to them the law of the lord that's all we have to keep on our mind praise the lord instead of fussing at the driver ahead of you instead of fussing at the red light instead of being angry with the traffic the lord may have kept you may have caused you to take another route the lord might have put you into his great bypass program praise the lord let's stand on our feet in john chapter one it really kind of forgot my attention this morning that god would give a vision concerning the little girl that was going to die she was destined to die brother branham said but yet god will put it on his heart for him to pray for her to bypass that praise the lord just like god told isaiah to tell hezekiah to put his house in order but god had to bypass that 15 years praise the lord saint john chapter 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was gone the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was me praise the lord then we dropped down to to verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth dear lord jesus we just commit ourselves in your hands tonight i pray that lord you will take this thought from my heart lord and by the inspiration of the holy spirit may something of internal value be said tonight that will draw us closer to you father made uh your word oh god we know we have a promise of this word be made flesh help us tonight lord in jesus name we pray amen praise the lord the lord bless you amen i got like i said i got caught up in the top and left what i was studying and uh try to look into this tonight so if i don't do a good job tonight then i know that uh you know it's it's one of those things but it's not it's not a good job you know to impress you we are doing a good job for the father amen he's the one that we want him to say that it's a good job praise the lord tonight i want to talk about a great bypass now you already seen where my mind is with this uh bypass you know all things work together for good to them that love the lord but uh one of the one of the commonplace in the message that brother branham make mention about the bad past with this electricity we hear brother branham saying we bypass our tear funding amen and and that kind of for catch our attention it catches the ego's eye we bypass our tear funding that becomes a language that we use over and over but let me read this he also said in that message that is where i want to take my inspiration from tonight he says now we see here plainly the complete secret of our life in joining as we about to talk about this bypass i want you to remember that brother man i'm talking about all of this he's talking about predestination he's talking about you know uh being in the mind of god being in a thought of god he says if you are not in the thought of god there is no way you can become word there is no way you can become a you that you don't have a tio funny because it is the thought of god but as he's talking on this he comes to this statement and says now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in joining just like he was traveling from illinois wherever he was going he missed his way and he found himself going back instead of going this way i don't know what i'm going south or not but in a way praise the lord instead of going south he finds himself going exactly to where he came from and when he got himself back he says well i think maybe the lord allow us in this journey for us to bypass setting trouble and yerey said he's comparing here the uh uh our complete secret of our life he says this shows plainly the secret of our life in joining from the mind of god back to the mind of god amen from the mind of god back to the presence of god let me say that way amen because we're not going back to touch amen we're going to work for him amen praise the lord so he says our the complete secret of our life in journey and death and where we go after we die praise the lord amen predestination is in plain view here now listing as we teach this closely so we're not talking on the wall is this uh uh uh in the metastatic we're talking about the great bypass now so as i was thinking on on the scripture i couldn't help but think about uh this comment brother brandon make over in who is this uh mexic about bypassing our tio funny and this scripture came to my mind in john chapter one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and yet in verse 14 the bible says and the word become flesh now because it's a prayer meeting tonight i might just use this platform to kind of lay the foundation here and maybe if the lord help us will pick it up as we travel the lawn but in the beginning was the word amen and we know that a word is a thought express praise the lord amen but you look at this the word that was in the beginning become flesh the word become flesh it's so easy we caught it like that the world become flesh just like john said amen we caught it so easy the word become flesh and dwelt among us the world become flesh endure among us but there is a process that was bypassed just like brother branham said there is there is a lot the secret of our life journey the secret of our life journey is in the bypass praise the lord amen for us to be here tonight there are a lot of things that we have to bypass and i believe that god works in the bypass the reason why i believe that is because jesus when he came to the earth his first ministry i mean the first miracle sorry praise the lord amen brother branham says at that word he says first he turned the water to wine now the water will have been wine some days anyhow perhaps but it will have to go through the regular procedure of going up into a grip vine coming out into a grape and being brought back and so far like that jesus just bypassed all of that process he bypassed all of that process but madam says that water something was going to be wine if a white vine was planted and the water the seed the water the seed the water the seed the roots would suck it up it would suck it up the van would grow and fruit would come they would pluck they would plug the fruit they would cut it they would press it and everything before it would they would go through all the process it will have to ferment it in everything all of that process but when jesus came he took the water and bypass all of that process and gave them wine the secret of your journey it's in the bypass are we together the regular procedure was going up into a grip vine coming out and and and and bring forward back and so forth like that jesus just bypassed all of that because he was the god of nature amen can we say praise the lord tonight can we give the lord a hand of praise amen thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus when the scripture says everything worked together for good [Applause] to them that love the lord it is by his mercy that we are not consumed we have no idea of what is happening in the back path sometimes we complain why is it not happening why is it not this time we we just complain we we get stuck up what's happening in front of maybe this guy make an accident they're just running they can't take time wasting my time i just got five minutes all of these young boys they would not drive straight and the city immersion emergency truck comes and put an arrow every car go this way oh my goodness we're gonna take me from on the road again i have to go all the way behind the city and and and our vein is just balling and we have no idea why the bypass praise the lord yes a little girl here the lord gave brother branham the vision that she was going to die in the wreck and the injured of the lord shall wake up and pray for her amen she was destined to die today in iraq in a black automobile which means he saw the vision amen and he told me to pray for the child that this will be a bypass we are not we are not uh we don't have the gift of of a prophet but sometimes god speaks to us in dreams and uh sometimes we have dreams and then sometimes people become terrified they want to block it away from their mind what god has ordained will happen praise the lord amen and sometimes we don't even have we don't even dream about anything and things happen are we together amen but what i'm trying to grab your mind told tonight is to be able to deal with the element of fear when we have dreams and and or whatever it is you know uh uh and and it looks frightening and it looks scary all you have to do is to just commit it to the lord and so just give it back to god i say lord i i don't know what what this means you don't have to make up interpretation no you don't have to you just give it to the lord you just prayed about it and said lord what whatever this is i committed into your hands if it is evil that will befall my brother lord may that bypass him amen i just believe it's a it's a it's a christian principle that the lord want to teach us here that's why he had brother branham come out and say these things to those people praise the lord but beside that we're going here verb just preached martian davos in the morning before he preached this message and i was thinking about this today so i was driving i says oh my goodness oh my goodness lord jesus you just have to help us how many times we take these uh uh messages that brother brandon preach and you know we just get a cited in a code a verse or two and then i mean i mean it has it has i don't want to go into all of those things but to just see if sometimes you sit back and you just look and see think in your mind why he did this you know why why the lord allowed him to do that just after preaching marriage and divorce he comes in the evening and he preached this message woo it is mekistic praise the lord all because there cannot be a marriage if there is not a priest to perform the marriage i don't want to go into that tonight but let's let's just stay with the bypass so we see jesus his every first miracle he got down there to the way to to the wedding and there was no wine praise the lord and his mother said whatever you ask him he would do it and he went to jesus and he turned the water into wine the bible is telling us here that in the beginning was the word and the word took on flesh praise the lord the word took on flesh the fullness of the word that was in the beginning that logos that was in the beginning comes down to time and it takes on flesh now if you think about the word that i'm speaking to you and words are coming from my mouth for words to take on flesh there is a process praise the lord isaiah said a virgin shall conceive god said my word do not go out and return to me involved that word that isaiah spoke it took 700 years praise the lord but even with that even with that even with the space of time the space of time is is not the problem and this i was i was meditating on this today i want to share with you we have to realize that god is not in our time god is out of our time he's not in our time cycle no that's why he can determine the end from the beginning amen knowing the end from the beginning is not just a slogan to say he knows everything but he knows exactly how it will end even before he thinks about how it will start he determine the end before he even think about how this thing will start he's out of our time zone praise the lord that's the reason why he's not panicking he's not in a hurried praise the lord because he stepped into time and he stepped out of time are we together that's the reason why we can trust him that's why we can take him at his word we can trust him and not to be fearful because he have everything under control when he made a promise he give a promise he said this thing will happen he give his word a virgin shall conceive you know what happened he speaks to isaiah and say a virgin shall conceive all the other priests the the religious people are that they they make a council they are discussing it when they are talking god take the bypass he take another role behind him they are arguing no it's going to be the the first daughter it has to be the high priest daughter no it has to be i mean they are cutting because according to the to the torah and when they are doing all of that he takes the bypass you will see that in jesus ministry when jesus comes on the scene after he had performed a miracle or he he did something and and there was an uproar and the people he just slipped all right they are talking at first he slipped before they realized he on the other side he said somebody has got their sight everybody running there oh i thought he was here joseph where he went to the complete secret of our life journey is in the bypass there are a lot of things that god have to make us to bypass for us to be here tonight praise the lord many times we think we are walking on a straight and narrow way but you are actually in the bypass oh my goodness me praise the lord i'll read another quote to you tonight maybe if the lord help us we'll find some time to preach amen the lord and are we together brother branham sorry the brother jordan's just a fade i don't have this one out there i didn't i didn't add it to my my coast tonight but brother branham you're talking in the message paradox he says it was a paradise when a capital son by the name jesus of nazareth took up five little biscuit in two fish and fed five thousand people if it isn't i want to see somebody do that today i want you to explain to me what kind of an atom he let loose how he how he did do it not only the fish but the fish was grown the fish was was killed the fish was clean the fish was cooked amen he took the little boy lunch are we together five biscuits two fish to feed five thousand people in another quote brother branham says we call it miracle he said we call it miracle he said well if you if you if you if you stop and think about it if you stop and think about it it's not that he he break the fish small like we do our communion bread so everybody can get a piece and as soon as they ate it their stomach was fought the bible says there were baskets left basket left the arabian was picked up and put in baskets which means he bypass the normal order right verbum for a fish to be caught still clean seasoned fried he's standing right there right there before then he bypassed that order for a week to grow and the wheat is grind and made out of flour and all the ingredients ingredients that was popped into the cake it was backpacks the hunger people were sitting there they were hungry they were looking at him he took the thread in his hands he lifted up when the human mind cannot factor the unimportance when we are lack of words the fish was cooked the fish was whatever it was the bread was planted a grove and all of its backpacks god turned it from a cokefish he just brought it out and broke it off and brought it out and broke it up and grew it out and broke it off the bible says he fed it was twelve thousand i mean five thousand men not counting the women and the children but yeah there were 12 baskets that was left is foreign praise the lord and it sounded good in my ears amen and watch now when jesus fed the mutter to you it's in john chapter 6 it was worth his ministry has come to a crossroad his ministry was coming to an end that's what brother branham said he had to say a high thing to them except you eat my flesh and you drink my blood so he did it at the beginning of his ministry and he did it at the end just before his ministry could change he showed the bypass just in a very little way praise the lord amen if you look all true history just think about this tonight think about it meditate on it the complete secret of our life journey the complete secret of our life journey from thought to word it was in the bypass are we together that god in this in this day brother branham over and over he said it there i couldn't i couldn't get all this stuff i mean i was just i was just so i was so caught up i was so it just it just hit me and i just i was just thinking about it i said oh god and i sometimes we we we we make these things little we just turned him into a message to preach or turn him into something to be excited about but when you just sit down and you just think about it right there in in sisterheady wright house two boys that were that was just uh uh uh uh running girl stubborn boys brother brown says axe whatever if it does not fall right in your lap then call me the false prophet after after she was she was honored such an intense reverence to what brother branham was saying because brother brahm said as he was narrating the story the house was quiet and under that intense reverence she said brother branham this is nothing but the truth praise the lord and the lord told brother branham whatever she asked for he said if he does not fall in your lap call me the false praise the lord and there in her house god did the bypass those two stubborn little boys sometimes we think it's in our hands praise the lord we think salvation is in our hands or it's in our power or is by the way we preach the word you need to be preaching on repentance you need to preach the word high sometimes we think that's it but god did not put his salvation plan in any man's hands it's not in any man's ministry but bran says when god wanted to save men right from the beginning when adam felt it was god himself that came down he never sent an angel he never sent a messenger he didn't send a preacher he came down if god was save a sinner on the street by using you to preach god has to come down god has to calm down if god will heal a person in the service i will lay my hands but god has to calm down because he is the healer if god will deliver the person a preacher will preach it can even be from a singing of a song god will come down and he will do the work he never sent an angel he never sent a second person for it was god in christ reconciling the word it was god in christ god in the virgin bomb body reconciling the word to himself and it has to be god in you it has to be god in me praise the lord right there god bypass he baptized church order he bypassed the major doctrine your doctrine of sanctification justification baptising of the holy ghost that we we cram in our head he bypass it right there before the eyes of all of the deacons were there brother tony one of the deacon brother brandon says that brother tony and one of the deacons they were all sitting on there he bypassed auto call he bapting for the reading of the word there was no standing for the reading of the word all she had to say the salvation of my sons he said i gave it to you they didn't have to go for baptism or class they didn't have to come through the channel of your doctrinal mind god bypass the natural church process and give those two boys the baptising of the holy ghost and if god said there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle it will not come through your church doctrine it will not come true the way you think for the mother of fire we were already born in sin shipley in iniquity so for for god to make that promise he had to bypass our natural birth oh my goodness i feel like preaching tonight but i'm not going to preach i'm not going to preach don't make me preach i don't want to preach amen because i have just few minutes left but listen to me a little bit listen to me a little bit we get so caught up in everything we know about ourself and sometimes it's become so hard for you to counsel some people you get them on the phone or you're talking to them trying to counsel them and just trying to show them a promise in the world that you can stand on that you can hotel no but you know no and in my no in my and we want god to work the way our kind of mind thinks we try to bring him down to the way our kind of mind when the bible says the kind of mind is enemy to god we try to reduce god down to our human mind until we want to use grammar verb and adverb the complete secret of our life journey oh glory to god tonight i will say like brother bran and my fee religious i feel religious the word become flesh there is a process

don't know about is the one that god has already done on your behalf when he pre-destinated and he fought thought about you you were not in a body form you are not in the flesh it's what god has already done on your behalf he elected you he choose you praise the lord he did all of that all of this on your behalf he did it in the bypass praise the lord when my grandfather they were worshiping idols this was a talk that was already taught about me amen they are worshipping of idols could not corrupt this seed no it just hid the seed under the earth the more adult worship was just putting the seed more under the air for it to take root when the light of the hour shines praise the lord when the light of the hour shine i still know that day i still know exactly what happened it was my birthday it was going to be i'm a few days after my birthday praise the lord some friends i've bought uh drinks that was the first time i was ever going to be drunk and god saved me from there they bought drinks and everything to make my birth birthday and i was and i gave them the money to buy it i was walking down i still know the spot as i'm talking to you tonight when i heard two philips preaching he was preaching on souls in praising a friend of mine we played soccer together and all of that and i stood across the street listen to him i said wow wow and then the battle was what's going on i knew my friends were waiting for me i said no if i go down there if i go to that preaching i know myself my heart i'm a sympathetic person so i start to take the bypass i start to escape and i've didn't go not about 10 minutes down the road when i just fed this strong feeling just like a hand on my shoulder turning around right back that was the light that was the day the light shine praise the lord that was the day the light shine amen some reason i got down there to phyllis i've already finished preaching and now and uh and i i just felt this push on my back and i was just passing the crowd and just going i'm calling him and then one of the young people that was going to the party says oh we are going are you not coming i said yeah you're go i'm coming that's how i went there met you phillips i i didn't even understand i never even listened to the message he was preaching it just attracted me and i did not even understand what was happening i just just stopped there

couldn't go anywhere i know my friends are waiting for me it was not bothering me what i was doing there and everything he was saying to me i just couldn't understand it after we left we walked a little bit i went home i decided to go home that night and i got home and i can still remember crying like i have never cried before ask me what i was crying about i don't know i can't tell you why but i was just i was just overwhelmed with a lot of emotion through my body it was just like a sea wave just all through the night praise the lord the entire secret of your journey is in the bypass oh my praise the lord okay it's time let's let's just read this from uh who is this there brother branham says now you bypass that he's talking about uh the teal funny talking about the word because in that form he knew all things and you have never been able to know that yet you have never been able to know that yet so as long as you are in this life there are things that will be kept from you you will not know why you have to go down the setting street you would not know why you had to turn a setting corner sometimes you turn right and it says there is no road true you got to make a u-turn to go back you get angry with the gps don't get angry with the gps don't get angry with the gps all things work together for good are we together let's read this let's read this this is the thing i want to read and i find myself talking should be reading amen that's what i said i should be reading and never say i want to give testimony should be reading keep your eyes in the bible brother warren for whom he did for known he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many bredwings moreover whom he did predestinate them also then he also called and whom he called then he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified but where is your sanctification it's supposed to be justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost where is she where is it right here paul is showing you that there is a bypass there is a bypass when he calls you when that initial call comes and you receive it then god start working in the bypass then we we get to this place no i'm justified i'm i'm sanctified no i'm i was justified before i'm centrifugable it looks like i'm still justified i've now become identified i mean i'm in the i'm in the test stage of grace i have faith now i've grown to vet you now i'm i'm asking the lord to give me knowledge we we try to make those things as literal things that we that we literally grow into it comes as a package just like when a child is born little grace down there she's just a little baby but everything that she needs to be a mother is already in her her parents don't have to shopping when she become five years old to go and shopping for five years old idea five years old behavior all they need to do is feed her right and keep her honor the right atmosphere and then the seed the thing that is in the sea will come to life that's all the believer needs to do feed on the world and stay in the right atmosphere get out of all of those ugly and unclean atmosphere say in the atmosphere of the world and the life that is in the sea will come up brother branham had to dramatize those things so we can get a picture of it he that he predestinated for new and called justified by faith has already been glorified let's stand together tonight musicians you can come praise the lord amen if the lord allow us we will continue if he said this is all for the night we
