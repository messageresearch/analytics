[16:03] Oh Alleluia amen amen
[16:14] I want to send greetings from all these
[16:17] Saints over in Toledo amen we had a
[16:20] wonderful time
[16:22] very unusual I've never been to this
[16:25] kind of a memorial service but it was a
[16:28] three and a half hours and so it was a
[16:31] lot of singing a lot of pictures videos
[16:34] and things like that actually if you'd
[16:36] like to go see brother John la
[16:39] Fontaine's memorial service they've got
[16:41] it out on their website literal Life
[16:43] Church dot org and you can watch the
[16:46] whole thing but it was just a real
[16:48] wonderful celebration of our brother's
[16:51] life and you know you know I remember
[16:57] from the I think it was the generations
[16:59] book that Rebecca Smith and George and
[17:02] Rebecca Smith put out there was one
[17:04] brother there that owned the gas station
[17:08] he had just built a new gas station and
[17:10] he was standing on the corner of brother
[17:12] branham and they were you know kind of
[17:14] admiring the new building and he turned
[17:17] to brother Branham I don't remember the
[17:19] brother's name but he said you know I
[17:20] wish my dad could have been here to see
[17:23] this brother Branham looked at him he
[17:25] said he's standing right down there at
[17:27] the corner looking at it right now I
[17:30] don't quite understand a lab but being a
[17:32] prophet which is the seer he could see
[17:35] into that other dimension you know I
[17:37] started looking around after a while and
[17:39] I started looking I thought I could see
[17:41] brother John just standing there just
[17:43] enjoying it amen my that's exactly what
[17:49] he wanted would have wanted his family
[17:51] to do is get the children the
[17:53] grandchildren up there you know
[17:55] worshiping the Lord and in serving the
[17:58] people in their by their music ministry
[18:00] so amen so it was a it was a wonderful
[18:04] time
[18:04] so but we're glad to be back he-man so
[18:15] I've got a new drummer in the church I
[18:24] was hoping that we could get him out
[18:26] from behind those drums and sing is
[18:28] special tonight there's only one song I
[18:34] can think of a man Beulah land
[18:40] [Music]
[18:42] a man it's good to be back you know it's
[18:51] funny because I don't think you know
[18:55] it's it's weird to kind of coming back
[18:57] it's only been like three months but you
[18:58] know it's like oh hey everything's still
[19:01] here it's good didn't burn down although
[19:02] you guys you're already playing it
[19:04] slower
[19:05] I noticed 10% slower the songs are
[19:07] slower it's funny because down in in
[19:10] Tennessee I'm trying to get them to sing
[19:11] the songs faster and then I come down
[19:13] back here and it's already slower so
[19:15] well the Lord knows you guys needed a
[19:18] break
[19:20] praise the Lord I think we sing it Indy
[19:23] I don't know I don't know what key we
[19:24] sing it in it's good to see you all send
[19:26] greetings from the church down there by
[19:28] the Tom cooker Shane as well as brother
[19:31] Barry Nepal lots of different ministers

[27:28] praise and what can we say where can we
[27:37] start from I bring greetings from home
[27:40] and all the brothers and sisters send
[27:45] their greetings mom Finn Yura went very
[27:49] well and just as I was traveling I
[27:53] started to think about it when I was
[27:55] receiving calls from the different
[27:58] brothers back home and brother dealers
[28:01] and his greetings he was planning to
[28:03] come but he had a meeting in Gannon
[28:06] their weekend brother Francis larger
[28:11] also his passport at the Canadian
[28:14] embassy and he couldn't get it out to
[28:17] come in but brother family Joseph came
[28:21] from Nigeria but Valentin and Bragg
[28:25] idiom came from the Ivory Coast well
[28:28] while I was going I was just thinking
[28:30] about it and and although I mean all the
[28:36] law of that the church shows the
[28:39] supporting out of death and I was just
[28:42] thinking uh since I wanted this what
[28:45] brother branham was talking about when
[28:49] he was talking about the squeeze you
[28:52] know it is it is that moment were when
[28:57] when something unexpected may happen
[29:01] even to a brother you know and you just
[29:07] see all the support and all the love you
[29:11] know I was just thinking about that and
[29:13] I was I was very overwhelmed the Saints
[29:16] home
[29:17] they all give us support while we were
[29:21] there but Elijah sent his greetings and
[29:23] everything went will praise the Lord
[29:26] so I thought I was going to go to a
[29:32] beach an hour actually should have left
[29:34] yesterday but then I was asking myself
[29:38] how many days am I going to stay there
[29:41] and brought deli what trying to get me a
[29:45] ticket to come to Nigeria and then I
[29:48] prayed I realized that pretty soon I
[29:50] might not be coming back to the US so I
[29:57] just decided I told him I said well
[30:00] instead of coming staying two days here
[30:03] and in two days on the other end let me
[30:06] go back and prepare myself for to come
[30:08] for the good visit praise the Lord but
[30:11] thank you for your prayers everything
[30:13] went well then and I came in happy and
[30:19] excited this evening but the brothers
[30:21] have already made some preparation so we
[30:24] will respect that
[30:25] and then brother Jordan will be speaking
[30:28] to us tonight but while I was I was I
[30:32] was coming on the flight I was thinking
[30:34] about there thinking about the service
[30:36] tonight and a little Todd was on my mind
[30:40] that is from Saint John chapter 16 a
[30:44] question that a disciple asked Jesus and
[30:51] the question was jesus said unto them
[30:57] over there in verse 16 a little why in
[31:03] the Asia not seeming and again a little
[31:08] wine and yes I see me because I go to
[31:11] the Father then says some of his
[31:16] disciple them on himself what is this
[31:19] that he is saying a little wine so I was
[31:24] going to preach on a little why tonight
[31:27] I was thinking about that in and I
[31:31] started staring only a little bit and
[31:34] what the talk was becoming beautiful in
[31:36] my mind so let's just sing that song

[42:34] kind of dis continuing on in the same
[42:36] line that what we were before or at
[42:40] least taking us a sub-branch of it and
[42:43] so reading in John 15 1 through 8 and
[42:46] then we'll let you be seated it says I
[42:49] am The True Vine and my father is the
[42:52] husbandman every branch in me that
[42:55] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and
[42:58] every branch that beareth fruit he
[43:01] purges it that it may bring forth more
[43:04] fruit now ye are clean through the word
[43:06] which I have spoken unto you abide in me
[43:10] and I in you as the branch cannot bear
[43:12] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[43:16] vine no more can ye except ye abide in
[43:20] me I am the vine ye are the branches he
[43:24] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[43:28] bringeth forth much fruit without me you
[43:32] can do nothing if a man abide not in me
[43:35] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[43:38] withered and men gather them and cast
[43:40] them into the fire and they are burned
[43:42] if he abide in me and my words abide in
[43:46] you you shall ask what you will and it
[43:49] shall be done unto you herein is my
[43:52] father glorified that you bear much
[43:55] fruit so shall ye be my disciples you
[44:00] may be seated for just for a title or a
[44:03] subject here I want to take a thought on
[44:06] the great husbandmen and their the very
[44:12] verse first verse there says I am The
[44:15] True Vine and my father is the
[44:18] husbandman we know that God
[44:22] manifests himself in many ways and then
[44:24] shows himself as a husband men he shows
[44:27] himself as the great shepherd he shows
[44:30] himself as an eagle and there's certain
[44:32] manifestations of that and that we can
[44:34] look at he's showing us a natural type
[44:36] so that we can go to the natural and see
[44:38] what are the characteristics of this
[44:39] natural type so that we can begin to see
[44:43] another part of God and see what he's
[44:45] wanting to do now husband men is one
[44:50] that takes care of can either be
[44:53] livestock or it can be just farming in
[44:55] general it can be a vineyard that is a
[44:58] husbandmen yeah there's many things
[45:01] under that that they can do but a
[45:03] husband one is one that cares for some
[45:10] area of the farm whether whatever it is
[45:14] on that piece of land now the father
[45:18] he's the great husbandmen and when we
[45:23] come down to verse eight he says hearing
[45:25] is my father glorified that you bear
[45:26] much fruit so we know he's the
[45:29] husbandmen and we are to bear fruit so
[45:32] that tells us something that tells us
[45:34] that if we were to be fruit bearers then
[45:37] there tells us something about our
[45:39] characteristics he's told some thing
[45:41] about his own characteristics and how he
[45:43] the relationship between us and the
[45:45] father's going to be if we are the
[45:48] bearer of the fruit and he is a husband
[45:50] men then he is the one who was going to
[45:53] be coming in and caring for you as the
[45:58] one who's producing the fruit now
[46:15] the direction I want to take this is
[46:17] looking at it as there's many types of
[46:19] plants that bear fruit but I want to
[46:22] take a look and look at a fruit bearing
[46:24] tree and the reason for that is that I
[46:29] actually used to live quite close to you
[46:32] and a very large pecan orchards and you
[46:36] would see how they would cultivate them
[46:38] all throughout the year and everything
[46:41] they did forth to those trees was
[46:44] specifically for the production of fruit
[46:48] at the time and season of fruit bearing
[46:52] the other example that I saw personally
[46:56] was when I was me and the wife we were
[46:59] in Hawaii for our honeymoon
[47:01] and we went to a coffee farm now they
[47:04] had coffee bushes on that farm that were
[47:09] of over a hundred years old and yet you
[47:12] wouldn't find a one on there that was
[47:14] more than about this tall and there's a
[47:17] reason for that because everything
[47:19] they'd done over the past hundred years
[47:21] specifically for the purpose of fruit
[47:23] bearing okay now if we look at a lot of
[47:28] different types of plants we could look
[47:30] at different types of trees that are not
[47:33] fruit bearing trees we look at them
[47:35] they're usually quite stately and even
[47:36] the way that they are cultivated is very
[47:41] different than a tree that bears fruit
[47:43] or a bush that is just there for
[47:47] aesthetics or for they would use you
[47:50] know you go to parts of Europe and they
[47:52] use bushes as fencing so that that bush
[47:56] had a very specific use you see but the
[48:00] father's trees are to bear fruit so that
[48:07] tells us something okay it tells us that
[48:10] they're gonna be treated different than
[48:12] all the other trees they're gonna be
[48:15] treated different than anything else
[48:17] that is not there but does not have the
[48:19] even the ability to bear fruit you see
[48:24] the ability is not even in it too
[48:26] bear fruit there's you know there's a
[48:29] pine tree out there it does have a type
[48:33] of fruit if you're into that but most
[48:35] people are not out there gathering pine
[48:38] cones okay it looks beautiful and what
[48:44] are people cultivated for its stately a
[48:45] look for its how how tell well it will
[48:49] grow to block the wind or for for some
[48:52] type of a visual shield you see and that
[48:59] that is is something that's specific to
[49:01] those trees but not specific to a fruit
[49:05] bearing tree you see now there's several
[49:13] wreaths there's there's throughout the
[49:17] season a fruit bearing tree is pruned
[49:23] continuously other than the time of
[49:26] fruit bearing okay and there's multiple
[49:29] reasons for pruning that's to promote
[49:33] growth
[49:34] it's to actually just save the tree
[49:37] during times of storms it's for
[49:43] restoration because you could buy a
[49:47] piece of property and let's say there
[49:48] was an apple tree on that piece of
[49:50] property you would go to it and if no
[49:54] one has touched it ever that trees gonna
[49:56] be full of dead limbs that falls gonna
[49:59] be full of growth that is just
[50:01] encumbering the tree that's sucking the
[50:05] life from the tree and keeping it from
[50:07] bearing fruit now it won't be able to
[50:10] completely get away from bearing fruit
[50:12] every year you'll see a couple of small
[50:15] shriveled apples on it but it'll never
[50:18] produce the fruit that it could if
[50:20] cultivated correctly okay so restoration
[50:26] but the most important reason for
[50:29] pruning is solely for fruit production
[50:32] solely for production it's the most
[50:36] important reason for pruning of the tree
[50:39] you see now in Luke 13 and six it says
[50:53] and he spake also this parable a certain
[50:57] man had a fig tree planted in his
[50:59] vineyard and he came and sought fruit
[51:01] thereon and found none then said he unto
[51:04] the dresser of his vineyard behold these
[51:07] three years I come seeking fruit of this
[51:09] fig tree and find none cut it down why
[51:13] come birth it the ground and he answered
[51:17] and said unto Him Lord let it alone this
[51:19] year also till I shall dig about it and
[51:22] dung it and if it bear fruit well and if
[51:26] not after that shall cut it down you see
[51:33] the master of the vineyard was coming
[51:37] and walking throughout the vineyard and
[51:39] he wasn't looking for how beautiful the
[51:42] tree was he wasn't looking for how
[51:44] stately it was how strong it appeared
[51:47] how green the leaves were but there was
[51:51] something specific he was looking for he
[51:55] said in he'd been coming to this tree
[52:00] continuously for three years for three
[52:05] years he'd been coming and all through
[52:08] every all three years he hadn't found
[52:11] fruit you see it was a it was a fruit
[52:15] tree and it was meant to bear fruit but
[52:21] he wasn't finding fruit on it you see it
[52:25] was over the right lineage was of the
[52:29] right type but it wasn't producing the
[52:32] life and that's what he was looking for
[52:37] he was looking for that life coming up
[52:40] through the tree to begin producing
[52:43] fruit and then expressing the life in
[52:46] the tree it wasn't just to be there it
[52:49] just wasn't to have life of itself but
[52:52] the life was to be
[52:53] through the tree and produced the fruit
[52:56] so that it could be part taken of and
[52:59] and shared with with those around it now
[53:06] we see here this Jesus had that parable
[53:09] but we know Christ himself
[53:12] expected fruit of a tree and we spoke
[53:14] about this before now he went walking by
[53:17] and hearing the parable he came during a
[53:19] time of fruit when there should have
[53:20] been fruit on the tree there should have
[53:23] been fruit there those three years that
[53:25] the the owner the vineyard came he
[53:28] didn't come during the pruning season he
[53:30] didn't come during the the time of of
[53:35] dunking of the tree to help give it
[53:38] strength and the vitamins that needed to
[53:41] grow and produce fruit but he would come
[53:43] all three years he came during the time
[53:46] when this tree should have been putting
[53:47] forth fruit so this wasn't a time when
[53:50] he was coming when it was the unexpected
[53:52] he wasn't asking of it more than what it
[53:56] should have produced he's just asking to
[53:59] just do what you're supposed to simply
[54:02] do what you're supposed to that's all he
[54:06] was looking for you see but Christ asked
[54:09] of you even more than that more than the
[54:14] master the vineyard because when he came
[54:17] seeking for fruit he came in a time when
[54:21] he knew that according to the season
[54:24] there was no fruit expected and yet when
[54:30] he came to it and look for fruit and
[54:34] there was no fruit on the tree he cursed
[54:37] it because he's not just calling for the
[54:43] tree to produce during certain times but
[54:47] to produce continuously you see because
[54:51] that's what the tree of life did from
[54:53] before the beginning of time was the
[54:56] Tree of Life was there in the garden and
[54:58] produced fruit for the people whenever
[55:01] they had need you see the Tree of Life
[55:05] Adam and Eve
[55:07] with a minute we always think that there
[55:08] was two trees that they actually had no
[55:11] access to but it was actually only one
[55:14] tree that they really weren't supposed
[55:16] to partake of and that was a tree of
[55:19] knowledge of good and evil the only
[55:21] reason why they were driven from the
[55:24] garden after the fall it was so they
[55:27] would not partake of the Tree of Life
[55:29] under that fallen condition and live
[55:34] forever in a state in a fallen condition
[55:38] so until Redemption could be brought
[55:41] forth they were driven away from that
[55:44] tree of life because though the tree of
[55:45] life continuously produces fruit and
[55:48] never stopped it didn't stop just
[55:50] because Adam failed doesn't mean the
[55:52] Tree of Life stopped producing the fruit
[55:55] they just had no access to it because we
[55:59] know the tree of life was Christ himself
[56:01] and so but I partake of the life of
[56:05] Christ is what they were separated from
[56:09] they were separated from that fellowship
[56:11] and so if he was that original fruit
[56:16] tree then we know that any fruit tree
[56:19] that is of his same lineage will be
[56:22] called upon to have the same
[56:24] characteristics produce the same fruit
[56:27] and in the same way in the same
[56:32] abundance as the original tree so that's
[56:36] why as he was walking through and he
[56:39] came to that tree that had no fruit and
[56:41] he looked he knew as a man he knew it
[56:46] wasn't the time in the season it was the
[56:49] wrong time and wrong season what as the
[56:55] god of heaven and earth coming down from
[57:00] the throne from a time of eternity he
[57:06] could remember back to the trees before
[57:08] they had come into that Fallen condition
[57:11] where there was always fruit on the vine
[57:14] and the being reaching up and looking
[57:18] for that fruit reminded him
[57:20] of the following condition that tree was
[57:24] in and it was not acceptable for that
[57:31] tree to stay there
[57:54] Psalms one one through six
[57:58] speaking of a man that is as a tree
[58:04] planted by rivers of water and in Psalms
[58:09] one will just go to verse three and it
[58:11] says he should be like a tree planted by
[58:13] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[58:15] his fruit in his season his leaf also
[58:19] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[58:22] shall prosper
[58:35] Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 8 for he
[58:43] shall be as a tree planted by the waters
[58:45] that spreadeth our roots by the river
[58:48] and shall not see when he cometh
[58:51] but her leaf shall be green and shall
[58:54] not be carefull in the year of drought
[58:57] neither shall cease from yielding fruit
[59:02] now here in Jeremiah he says something
[59:09] and he says no matter what the
[59:12] conditions are around the tree the leaf
[59:17] shall not wither the joy shall not be
[59:20] taken away and it shall never cease from
[59:26] yielding fruit so even in this condition
[59:29] of drought in a condition of no water in
[59:35] a condition of no sustenance in a
[59:40] condition of no support in a condition
[59:43] where it seems like it's all alone in a
[59:46] condition like it looks up into the
[59:49] heavens and it looks like there's
[59:51] there's no help coming you see because a
[59:55] drought there's no cloud a cloud in the
[59:58] sky you know during the time of Elijah
[1:00:01] there when when there was a drought they
[1:00:03] hadn't seen even a cloud for the years
[1:00:07] that he had said there would be no rain
[1:00:08] and when there was hope was even the
[1:00:14] smallest cloud would he lie she looked
[1:00:15] up and he said he see I see a cloud
[1:00:17] about the size of a man's hand we hear
[1:00:20] in a time of drought there isn't even
[1:00:22] that and yet this tree despite the
[1:00:28] drought is called upon to still express
[1:00:35] the joy of the Lord
[1:00:37] it's still called upon to produce fruit
[1:00:40] and never cease from producing fruit you
[1:00:45] see
[1:00:54] now we are in in that condition today
[1:00:59] you say how are we in that condition I
[1:01:02] know we look around here we're in the in
[1:01:05] especially in the United States and we
[1:01:07] don't see any famine we don't even see
[1:01:10] droughts and in fact we're where we
[1:01:12] stand out you know in with technology
[1:01:15] lack of rain for a short period of time
[1:01:18] won't won't be a big issue that's why we
[1:01:22] got Wells and that's why we got the we
[1:01:25] pump water in in Israel there they're
[1:01:28] taking they take salt water and they
[1:01:30] turn it into fresh water you know we
[1:01:32] look around and your to tell someone who
[1:01:34] the thing that we got to worry about
[1:01:35] right now is is famine and drought and
[1:01:39] they're like no I don't think so
[1:01:42] we're not the least not here we're not
[1:01:45] in a third world country but you see God
[1:01:48] was not talking about it just like the
[1:01:51] tree he's not concerned so much about
[1:01:53] the natural tree he wasn't putting this
[1:01:57] in parable form to talk about trees but
[1:02:01] he's laying something down for you to
[1:02:03] catch an understanding of how your life
[1:02:06] should be expressing the life of Christ
[1:02:08] even in a time of drought and we look at
[1:02:13] it and we know we're in a time of
[1:02:14] drought because it speaks about in the
[1:02:17] Book of Amos about the end times and in
[1:02:21] Amos 8 chapter verse 11 it said behold
[1:02:25] the day comes saith the Lord God that I
[1:02:27] will send a famine in the land not a
[1:02:30] famine of bread nor a thirst for water
[1:02:33] but hearing the words of the Lord and
[1:02:36] they shall wander from sea to sea and
[1:02:38] from North even to the east and they
[1:02:41] shall run to and fro and seek the word
[1:02:43] of the Lord and shall not find it and in
[1:02:46] that day shall the fair virgins and
[1:02:48] young men faint for thirst so we see
[1:02:53] here that we are understanding now that
[1:02:56] this drought is not a drought for
[1:02:59] natural water but it's a drought for the
[1:03:02] Word of God and the revelation of the
[1:03:06] word
[1:03:06] in and amongst the people and it's in a
[1:03:14] point where it's not so much the word as
[1:03:18] a physical form there's more Bibles
[1:03:22] printed there's more Bibles sold and
[1:03:25] more Bibles held in the hands of
[1:03:27] individuals today than ever before in
[1:03:30] the history of man it's not for the lack
[1:03:33] of being able to see it it's not for the
[1:03:36] lack of being able to read it but it's
[1:03:38] for the lack of understanding so for the
[1:03:41] lack of revelation because if if you
[1:03:44] have no revelation it's not open unto
[1:03:46] you if that is not open unto you it
[1:03:49] doesn't do anything for you
[1:03:51] it doesn't feed the soul it doesn't
[1:03:54] bring quench the thirst and here as we
[1:03:59] stand in that time of drought when it
[1:04:04] looks like everything is Raya round us
[1:04:06] yet
[1:04:07] God is looking to us and saying yet yet
[1:04:12] you sons and daughters of God are being
[1:04:17] called upon to yet still produce fruit
[1:04:20] in a time of drought because that's what
[1:04:25] he did he came in a time of spiritual
[1:04:28] drought and despite that he didn't let
[1:04:33] that get in the way of him being the
[1:04:35] expressed word for the hour he didn't
[1:04:38] let that get in the way for him catching
[1:04:41] a revelation of where he stood in the
[1:04:42] word and what his was what he was meant
[1:04:46] to do despite where everyone else was
[1:04:50] that despite the religious leaders of
[1:04:53] his day despite how they had taken the
[1:04:56] word and made it of none effect to the
[1:04:58] people but it was a personal walk with
[1:05:04] God that he had it come and fully
[1:05:08] surrendered to that so despite the
[1:05:11] conditions around him he would then
[1:05:13] express that life from the inside out
[1:05:18] the fruits of the spirit would then be
[1:05:20] manifested on the tree
[1:05:22] now fruit trees both in pruning and in
[1:05:31] harvesting it can be quite brutal and
[1:05:35] we'll take a second here and and just
[1:05:38] take a look at a few examples of some of
[1:05:40] God's fruit trees that have produced
[1:05:42] fruit throughout the throughout time but
[1:05:45] you know when the farmer comes in and he
[1:05:51] begins to trim the tree the most
[1:05:54] important thing about producing fruit is
[1:05:58] first of all it's got to be close enough
[1:06:00] to the ground to be easily gathered
[1:06:04] second of all the place where the most
[1:06:07] fruit grows is on new growth new growth
[1:06:13] there has to be continuous new growth to
[1:06:17] produce the the highest yield of fruit
[1:06:20] it may look good it may look strong but
[1:06:24] if there's no new growth on the tree
[1:06:26] there's the chance for fruit is very low
[1:06:29] so the farmer is gonna come in and first
[1:06:33] of all if you've ever seen either apple
[1:06:37] or citrus orchards they come in and they
[1:06:40] just crop the top right off the trees
[1:06:42] all that self-importance they just take
[1:06:46] it right off in fact they're all day all
[1:06:49] they cut them all down at the same
[1:06:50] height why because they're thinking
[1:06:53] about the fruit yield they're wanting to
[1:06:57] gather fruit they're not worried about
[1:06:59] how tall that tree is gonna grow because
[1:07:01] the tree growing extra tall doesn't do
[1:07:05] anything for the farmer doesn't do
[1:07:08] anything for the husbandmen it doesn't
[1:07:11] benefit his kingdom in any way shape or
[1:07:14] form so guess what that comes off
[1:07:20] anything anything now they start looking
[1:07:23] at the tree and looking at it going is
[1:07:25] there anything here that is making this
[1:07:27] tree too heavy
[1:07:29] we want that we want it to have a nice
[1:07:32] solid center right but we don't want
[1:07:36] limbs that are too heavy that are going
[1:07:38] off on their own off in any weird
[1:07:41] direction why because as the time goes
[1:07:44] by they're gonna get heavy and they're
[1:07:46] gonna snap off and when they snap off
[1:07:49] they actually can take and cut right
[1:07:52] into the heart of the tree and be a
[1:07:56] detriment to that tree and actually
[1:07:59] killed a life in the tree now we might
[1:08:01] be able to save it but once again we're
[1:08:04] concerns concerned about fruit we'll
[1:08:07] save the tree if we need to if this
[1:08:09] happens but we don't want that to happen
[1:08:12] because it it destroys the truth that
[1:08:15] tree for its ability to yield fruit and
[1:08:19] the next coming seasons and so is it
[1:08:23] with us is we get you know we go off on
[1:08:26] a tangent here or we go off on a tangent
[1:08:28] there or we go off on our own thing and
[1:08:30] God wants to come in right the beginning
[1:08:32] and cut that thing out we think that we
[1:08:35] know best and know he wants to cut that
[1:08:37] out he knows if he lets you run out on a
[1:08:39] limb too long it's gonna get heavy and
[1:08:42] it's gonna damage that life and your
[1:08:46] ability to produce fruit and benefit the
[1:08:49] body
[1:08:50] now instead of benefiting the body
[1:08:52] you're actually gonna be pulling the
[1:08:54] body down why because the body is gonna
[1:08:57] have to come up around you and bind you
[1:08:59] up and tell you're well enough to
[1:09:01] produce fruit again but your ability of
[1:09:05] this fruit goes back to zero so pruning
[1:09:10] very important and they come in it is
[1:09:13] it's almost without discretion they they
[1:09:17] they clean it all up
[1:09:18] everything gets cut anything that's
[1:09:20] there that doesn't need to be there gets
[1:09:21] cut out doesn't matter well you know how
[1:09:25] the tree feels about it well I kind of
[1:09:26] like that limb don't matter cut it out
[1:09:28] gone why because we want to get that
[1:09:31] tree down to a certain size because we
[1:09:34] know at a certain size with a certain
[1:09:36] number of limbs it's gonna when life
[1:09:38] begins to come into the tree and the
[1:09:41] nutrients we've been giving it all the
[1:09:43] time began to come up into the life of
[1:09:45] the tree it's gonna have to push it out
[1:09:47] somewhere and it's gonna push out all
[1:09:51] that new growth and at the end of all
[1:09:53] that new growth is where all that fruits
[1:09:55] gonna be growing okay
[1:09:59] so we'll talk about harvest in a minute
[1:10:06] but let's take a look at a few people a
[1:10:09] few fruit trees that God did a lot of
[1:10:15] trimming on and one that'll this take
[1:10:17] quickly we can look at is Joseph Joseph
[1:10:22] you would look at him and you know from
[1:10:24] the time he was born he was favored of
[1:10:26] the father but you know whether he he
[1:10:31] thought so or not Joseph became a little
[1:10:34] bit self-important you know he had a
[1:10:38] little bit of developed a little bit of
[1:10:39] pride and he felt like he was began to
[1:10:42] felt like he was an authority on
[1:10:43] spiritual issues with him within the
[1:10:47] church you know I I I have a dream and
[1:10:51] and this is my dream and I'm gonna share
[1:10:54] it all with you he didn't he didn't go -
[1:10:55] you know - Jacob first and say dad I had
[1:11:03] this dream I just want to know what you
[1:11:04] think about it and and then after
[1:11:09] telling Jacob Jacob well yeah that's a
[1:11:11] really good dream we should share it
[1:11:12] with the family he didn't do that
[1:11:15] you know he waited for he waited til
[1:11:17] they all sat down for dinner and he was
[1:11:19] sitting next to his dad at the right
[1:11:21] hand because he was the favorite and
[1:11:26] there in this place of importance is
[1:11:29] where he decided to share his dream from
[1:11:32] now he had more than one dream that were
[1:11:36] very similar and the first one just said
[1:11:38] that basically when you interpreted it
[1:11:41] and you didn't have to be real smart to
[1:11:42] interpret it to see where it was going
[1:11:45] was that all his older brothers were
[1:11:49] gonna serve him now we know cuz we are
[1:11:52] at the end we know how it ended that it
[1:11:54] was a true dream the interpretation was
[1:11:56] correct
[1:11:57] you see but whether you're right or not
[1:12:01] has very little to do with it but what
[1:12:04] when what way is it that you're bringing
[1:12:06] forth the truth because God has set in
[1:12:10] his word away that you're supposed to do
[1:12:14] things a way that you're supposed to
[1:12:16] bring a message to the church a way that
[1:12:19] you're supposed to honor the elders of
[1:12:21] the church a way that you're supposed to
[1:12:24] do certain things because if it's done
[1:12:27] correctly then it can be received but if
[1:12:30] it's done incorrectly even though it's
[1:12:31] the truth it won't be certain received
[1:12:34] you see so here's Joseph he's coming and
[1:12:38] he he feels real spiritual you know he's
[1:12:41] got his his his real special robe on and
[1:12:44] and you know he's he's favored of the
[1:12:46] Lord and favored of his dad and favored
[1:12:49] of everybody and you know and he's and
[1:12:52] on top of it he's rather clueless he has
[1:12:58] no idea that on the undertones that he's
[1:13:02] setting in the family or are just
[1:13:05] turmoil and strife anger animosity why
[1:13:10] because of his approach now we know it
[1:13:13] was all for a purpose God was doing it
[1:13:16] for a reason
[1:13:17] because God had a place where he was
[1:13:20] gonna take Joseph to where he had a take
[1:13:23] and trim things out of his life and
[1:13:25] build a character that was fit to rule
[1:13:29] so yes he was favored of the Lord and he
[1:13:33] was favored and Lord throughout his
[1:13:35] entire life
[1:13:36] there actually was not a day in Joseph's
[1:13:39] life that he was not favored or blessed
[1:13:41] of the Lord no all you're like wait a
[1:13:44] minute I think I've read that story and
[1:13:46] I'm pretty sure that's not how it goes
[1:13:48] well our problem is and was probably
[1:13:51] Joseph's problem at one point or another
[1:13:53] is what we consider blessings you see if
[1:13:59] someone says I've been really blessed
[1:14:01] the next thing we're gonna hear out of
[1:14:03] their mouth is how they got a new car
[1:14:05] they just bought a house they got a new
[1:14:08] job they got a raise
[1:14:10] but maybe they won the lottery I mean
[1:14:13] not that we buy lottery tickets of maybe
[1:14:15] someone gave it to him it could happen
[1:14:17] but that's when song says blessings
[1:14:21] that's the first things that we think
[1:14:23] about but we know that the trying of our
[1:14:28] faith is greater and of more value than
[1:14:32] gold try it in the fire so what we have
[1:14:39] to do is then now apply this new way of
[1:14:43] looking at it to our lives and the lives
[1:14:48] of the believers and see how often were
[1:14:51] they blessed and how often were they not
[1:14:54] and when we begin to look at it the
[1:14:57] times that we would normally look at and
[1:14:59] go like man they were having a rough
[1:15:01] time when we begin to look at it through
[1:15:04] God's eyes and see it through his eyes
[1:15:08] the times that we're going like they're
[1:15:10] having it rough once we take and look at
[1:15:13] it through God's filter like man that's
[1:15:17] the most blessed time of their life why
[1:15:20] because God was doing something and
[1:15:23] preparing them to produce fruit if
[1:15:28] they'd never gone through that there
[1:15:31] would have never been any fruit or the
[1:15:33] fruit that was would come wouldn't have
[1:15:37] been worth even writing down about go to
[1:15:42] nothing to the term says nothing to
[1:15:44] write home about it's something you
[1:15:47] plucked it you ate it
[1:15:48] you took one bite and you tossed it away
[1:15:51] because it looked good but there was
[1:15:54] nothing to it right and here's Joseph
[1:15:58] and he's getting things pruned out of
[1:16:02] his life the first thing that gets taken
[1:16:04] away from him is his self-importance and
[1:16:07] authority within the family why how do
[1:16:12] we see that his brothers strip him of
[1:16:14] his coat that mantle that showed his
[1:16:16] favor with the father and sell him and
[1:16:20] sell him down into Egypt
[1:16:23] now that's a pretty rough pruning
[1:16:26] already but you know god still wasn't
[1:16:29] done he gets old down into Egypt and he
[1:16:34] begins to a little bit at a time he's a
[1:16:36] slave but of his own ability he's he's a
[1:16:39] he was given a lot of natural gifts go
[1:16:42] out equipped him with the right gifts
[1:16:45] for the job he was gonna have to handle
[1:16:47] now those gifts he had from the day he
[1:16:51] was born
[1:16:52] cuz gifts and callings come without
[1:16:55] repentance so Joseph was a very gifted
[1:16:59] individual very intelligent we know that
[1:17:03] because he got the power for his house
[1:17:04] and he took part of hers house from an
[1:17:07] average house - it was doing so well
[1:17:10] that the man of the house took and
[1:17:15] turned all authority over to the slave
[1:17:18] boy he had bought out of out of out of
[1:17:21] Israel or what it wasn't even is ray out
[1:17:23] of Canaan so we know he was doing
[1:17:29] something right and he had natural gifts
[1:17:32] to handle money to handle men to handle
[1:17:36] property to handle cattle - you name it
[1:17:40] he had he had the gifts and the ability
[1:17:43] to do it but God said okay I've given
[1:17:47] you a little try at this you know just
[1:17:49] like David when he was in Saul's Court
[1:17:51] Lord brought him into Saul's Court but
[1:17:56] he didn't just bring him into Saul's
[1:17:57] Court and then from there just here you
[1:17:59] go your king now he had to continue
[1:18:03] shaping David's character so he'd be fit
[1:18:06] to rule he allowed him to come into that
[1:18:09] position so he would see what it was
[1:18:10] like to be in that position and the
[1:18:14] authority and the responsibility that
[1:18:16] would be laid upon you but he still
[1:18:18] wasn't done shaping him he still wasn't
[1:18:20] ready so Joseph here he is he's at the
[1:18:25] pinnacle the only thing he could have
[1:18:28] been more was free to be his own master
[1:18:32] there wasn't anything who was waiting
[1:18:34] for I don't think he was living in the
[1:18:36] slaves quarters
[1:18:38] he had full access and run of the house
[1:18:41] I'm sure he had his own very nice
[1:18:44] quarters somewhere on the property if he
[1:18:47] didn't beforehand he probably had it
[1:18:48] built for himself because he had full
[1:18:51] authority over the entire estate he if
[1:18:55] there was a granary to be built he was
[1:18:57] going on who made the decision if there
[1:18:59] was a crop that was gonna be sowed he
[1:19:02] was one who decided what got sowed
[1:19:04] that's how much was turned over to him
[1:19:07] there was something to be purchased he
[1:19:08] decided what was gonna be purchased and
[1:19:10] how much was gonna be paid for it
[1:19:12] everything was isn't in his hand but God
[1:19:17] said I'm gonna put something else in
[1:19:18] your way cuz I'm gonna take you from
[1:19:21] this position that you felt maybe Joseph
[1:19:24] was feeling like wow look it they sold
[1:19:26] me into slavery but look what I've been
[1:19:29] able to do that I showed them what God's
[1:19:35] like no no it's not you and he brings
[1:19:40] the next trial and accusers gets him
[1:19:44] accused allows him to be accused of
[1:19:46] something he didn't even do and now he's
[1:19:49] cast into prison but we see God is still
[1:19:52] blessing him because if Joseph would
[1:19:56] have received the punishment for the
[1:19:58] crime he would have been executed he
[1:20:03] wouldn't have been sitting in prison see
[1:20:06] God's just moving him God's moving him
[1:20:09] getting him ready and now he sets him in
[1:20:12] prison takes all this authority away
[1:20:14] takes everything and strips it out again
[1:20:17] and takes him back down to nothing and
[1:20:20] now Joseph sitting in prison and as far
[1:20:23] as he knows he's in for a life sentence
[1:20:26] but God's working on him working on his
[1:20:29] character and now even within the prison
[1:20:33] God's letting him use his gift to be
[1:20:37] expressed no matter the conditions
[1:20:39] around him
[1:20:41] God's wanting that character to come out
[1:20:43] so showing Joseph I gave you these gifts
[1:20:46] and whether I allow you to be in the the
[1:20:49] richest of the rich
[1:20:51] in the largest companies whether you're
[1:20:53] the CEO or you're down in the dungeon I
[1:20:57] still want you to use those gifts for me
[1:20:59] no matter how low in life you feel you
[1:21:02] are God still wants you to express his
[1:21:05] life and use the gifts he gave you to be
[1:21:09] a blessing that to those around you you
[1:21:12] see Joseph finally was able to bless
[1:21:15] somebody else other than himself when he
[1:21:17] was in Potiphar's house
[1:21:18] Potiphar got really blessed because
[1:21:21] Joseph was there because he was
[1:21:24] partaking of the fruit from Joseph's
[1:21:26] tree but so was it in prison Joseph
[1:21:31] didn't have God didn't give Joseph the
[1:21:33] right in prison just because he was in
[1:21:35] prison
[1:21:35] to sit back and feel sorry for himself
[1:21:38] but even in prison he was called on to
[1:21:43] minister to those around him and
[1:21:45] continue to pour out of himself of his
[1:21:48] gifts and let God God worked through him
[1:21:53] and manifest that life even to the
[1:21:56] prisoners and even to the guards so it
[1:21:59] wasn't just to the prisoners right to
[1:22:03] those around him but even to the guards
[1:22:05] of the prison those who are holding him
[1:22:08] in bondage even to them he was called on
[1:22:11] to express the very life and thoughts of
[1:22:15] God to and allowed even them to be
[1:22:18] partakers of the fruit that was on the
[1:22:21] vine you see they called God's working
[1:22:26] him to something God's working him to
[1:22:28] something Moses Moses say almost the
[1:22:33] exact same you can see God did almost
[1:22:36] the exact same thing here he is he was
[1:22:41] meant to be born into poverty into
[1:22:43] slavery but God made sure he was born
[1:22:47] and raised in the most stately of manner
[1:22:51] because God said who what better way to
[1:22:56] have my servant trained on how to lead
[1:22:59] people
[1:23:02] then let those who I'm gonna use him to
[1:23:05] deliver the people from do the training
[1:23:10] if there was anyone who knew how to
[1:23:12] train people on how to move armies how
[1:23:17] to build cities how to move groups of
[1:23:21] people how to conduct business the
[1:23:24] Egyptians were at the top of the game at
[1:23:28] the top seeing God just slid him right
[1:23:31] in there said now am i protecting him
[1:23:33] what he's getting an education too
[1:23:36] but when he hit the pinnacle of that and
[1:23:39] God was ready to use him he said now you
[1:23:41] got all this education
[1:23:43] you're too self-important you're too
[1:23:46] self
[1:23:50] you have too much prestige you have too
[1:23:52] much I can do it myself
[1:23:54] because that's what he tried to do he
[1:23:56] went out and he said okay well I
[1:23:58] realized that I'm a Jew and my mother
[1:24:01] tells me I was called to deliver the
[1:24:03] people well I've been a general here in
[1:24:06] the armies of Egypt for the past almost
[1:24:08] 40 years I've run campaigns all across
[1:24:12] the deserts I've taken cities I've
[1:24:16] destroyed armies many times my size I
[1:24:19] know how to I know how to conquer I know
[1:24:22] how to set people free and so what does
[1:24:26] he do he takes the sword and his own
[1:24:29] ability and knowledge and he attempts to
[1:24:33] conquer Egypt you see but Egypt had
[1:24:37] become a part of him as well and as long
[1:24:41] as he was trying to conquer himself by
[1:24:45] himself it was never going to happen for
[1:24:49] every dead Egyptian he killed there was
[1:24:52] another Egyptian to kill for every one
[1:24:55] that went down there was another one
[1:24:56] that would pop up and as long as he kept
[1:24:59] doing it his way
[1:25:01] it wouldn't work but God used that
[1:25:04] because now he said okay I've let you
[1:25:06] see all this I've put you in this place
[1:25:09] and now I'm gonna tear you back down to
[1:25:11] nothing all these branches you've grown
[1:25:14] how tall you gotten how
[1:25:16] pretty you look get ready because the
[1:25:19] buzz cuts coming and that's what he did
[1:25:22] he came in and he sheared Moses of
[1:25:25] everything power he pulled away his
[1:25:29] authority he pulled away his importance
[1:25:31] he pulled away his he took him from his
[1:25:35] family he drove him out into the desert
[1:25:38] so even the people he thought he had
[1:25:41] started to identify with he couldn't
[1:25:44] even have access to them and God dries
[1:25:47] him out into the desert into a place of
[1:25:49] drought and he said Moses you're gonna
[1:25:53] go out there into a place of drought
[1:25:55] until I see that you're ready to bear
[1:25:58] fruit in any condition not just when the
[1:26:01] condition is good but in any condition
[1:26:04] and when you're ready to believe
[1:26:06] anything and Moses got to that point
[1:26:09] because he got to the point where he was
[1:26:13] so yielded that he could see a bush on
[1:26:17] fire in a desert which is not so unusual
[1:26:21] walked up to it and instead of start
[1:26:26] addressing it with his intellect to
[1:26:28] figure out what was going on but the
[1:26:29] bantam says he didn't take a look at it
[1:26:31] and say well maybe I need you to take a
[1:26:33] sample of these leaves and take him back
[1:26:35] to the lab and see why it is that they
[1:26:36] don't burn God put him out too long
[1:26:41] enough to where he wasn't trying to use
[1:26:43] his own ability and thoughts his own
[1:26:46] ideas to figure it out in fact he got
[1:26:49] touched to the point to where even when
[1:26:51] he sees a bush on fire and all sudden
[1:26:53] the bush starts talking to him what you
[1:26:57] would think anyone who had a bush or a
[1:26:59] donkey start talking to you you it would
[1:27:02] catch your attention and immediately
[1:27:03] you're like there's something going on
[1:27:05] here but Moses he's so down and out he's
[1:27:11] got so down to the point where I'm old
[1:27:14] he's 80 years old he's got no strength
[1:27:18] of his own anymore he's got a bush
[1:27:21] talking to him and for all he knows he's
[1:27:25] hallucinating
[1:27:26] and God means to speak to
[1:27:30] and says I'm gonna send you back to
[1:27:31] Egypt to deliver my people and all Moses
[1:27:38] has the entire time is what he can't do
[1:27:41] I have no strength I can't talk he was
[1:27:45] at one of the greatest orators of his
[1:27:47] time in Egypt do you think you could be
[1:27:50] a Prince of Egypt and you were not a
[1:27:52] powerful orator you got something else
[1:27:55] coming these were men who were taught to
[1:27:58] stand before peoples and crowds and
[1:28:00] military mites and command them with
[1:28:02] their voice command them with their
[1:28:04] authority and God got him to the point
[1:28:08] where he said deliver the people I can't
[1:28:10] even I can't even talk to nobody I have
[1:28:12] problems talking to the Sheep luckily
[1:28:14] they just follow me because God had gone
[1:28:20] in and used 40 more years to trim that
[1:28:23] tree down until it was a point now where
[1:28:26] any life put it into it would produce
[1:28:28] new growth where fruit could be produced
[1:28:31] okay
[1:28:34] he'll jump we'll jump real quick here
[1:28:36] and I don't want to be too long and I
[1:28:38] think I already am I will jump to the
[1:28:40] New Testament Paul the Apostle Paul one
[1:28:45] of God's great fruit trees you know he
[1:28:48] went through the kind of almost the
[1:28:50] exact same steps he grew up and was
[1:28:55] trained by the best
[1:28:58] Gamaliel was known as a teacher of
[1:29:00] teachers respected by all and that was
[1:29:06] Paul's teacher he was zealous to a fault
[1:29:12] he was ready to take everything he'd
[1:29:14] been taught and he was gonna apply it
[1:29:17] and and if I feel like you're a step out
[1:29:21] of line I'm gonna let you know and he
[1:29:25] had it memorized - so you couldn't beat
[1:29:26] him you think well you know
[1:29:30] well Paul is not that bad and he has
[1:29:32] scripture for you here description for
[1:29:34] you get a quote for you he could tell
[1:29:36] you exactly how it was to the smallest
[1:29:39] detail that you were transgressing the
[1:29:41] law
[1:29:45] and God did that for a purpose he let
[1:29:48] him go through that but then he had to
[1:29:52] take him and and start tearing him down
[1:29:55] same thing you know he sent him to the
[1:29:57] backside of the desert into a place of
[1:29:59] drought where he his only thing he could
[1:30:03] rely on was was the Lord coming forth
[1:30:06] and begin to reveal this word to him
[1:30:08] everything he thought he knew he had to
[1:30:11] come to a place where he said everything
[1:30:12] I thought I knew I count his dung all my
[1:30:16] own learning all my own thoughts
[1:30:18] everything I thought I knew about the
[1:30:21] scripture everything I thought I knew
[1:30:23] about the coming Messiah everything I
[1:30:26] thought I knew about anything in life
[1:30:29] I've come to the place where I counted
[1:30:31] as dung it's as nothing
[1:30:36] God had to take him back and scale him
[1:30:39] down and in fact there was God trimmed
[1:30:43] he kept his fruit tree so trimmed there
[1:30:46] was a part of him that Paul never could
[1:30:48] get back beyond and God told him my
[1:30:52] grace is sufficient for you because that
[1:30:55] will continuously remind you of how
[1:30:58] small you are he said because I have so
[1:31:00] much revelation for you
[1:31:02] that I'm gonna keep this little thorn of
[1:31:05] the flesh here to remind you of how
[1:31:07] small you are no matter how much
[1:31:09] revelation you get you're gonna be
[1:31:11] reminded of how small you are and how
[1:31:15] it's not you but it's the Lord and the
[1:31:18] life of God being produced through you
[1:31:20] you see
[1:31:28] now we mentioned talking about producing
[1:31:31] fruit in a time of drought but I have
[1:31:36] some good news for you is even back in
[1:31:38] Psalms is it spoke about that fruit tree
[1:31:42] or that man being planted by rivers of
[1:31:44] water and even in a time of drought the
[1:31:48] believer has access to the river of life
[1:31:55] always you see because that is his life
[1:32:00] source it flows deep underground and the
[1:32:05] roots of the believer weeks down to that
[1:32:08] underground river of life and tap into
[1:32:11] it where all the other trees or all the
[1:32:15] others around him are suffering from the
[1:32:18] drought on the surface that tree has
[1:32:20] reached down why because the storms of
[1:32:23] life have forced him to go deep with his
[1:32:25] roots and reach down into that river of
[1:32:28] life to draw forth now there is a reason
[1:32:31] why you have access and that just isn't
[1:32:34] for your own benefit but in John 7 and
[1:32:38] 37 through 39 it says in the last day
[1:32:41] the great in that last the last day of
[1:32:43] that great day of the feast Jesus stood
[1:32:46] and cried saying if any man thirst let
[1:32:48] him come unto me and drink so here in a
[1:32:53] time of drought you have access to water
[1:32:59] you have access to life you just have to
[1:33:04] come and receive it and it says he that
[1:33:08] believeth on me as the scripture hath
[1:33:11] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:33:14] of living water but this he spake of the
[1:33:18] Spirit which they that believe on him
[1:33:20] should receive but the Holy Ghost was
[1:33:23] not yet given because that Jesus was not
[1:33:25] yet glorified so here we see even at a
[1:33:30] time of drought Jesus says that if any
[1:33:35] man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:33:37] drink but it's not just to sustain your
[1:33:40] own life but
[1:33:41] even as the tree is putting out fruit so
[1:33:47] here he's calling that the individual
[1:33:51] that would come and drink of these
[1:33:53] rivers of life it wouldn't just be to
[1:33:56] take it and internalize it but it's
[1:33:58] become something that flows out from the
[1:34:02] individual so it's not just an importing
[1:34:05] but also an outpouring of the spirit
[1:34:07] back out onto the people around you you
[1:34:11] see because he's not just calling you to
[1:34:14] leave us live a secret life with a
[1:34:17] secret reserve you know that's where
[1:34:19] people are all doing today they're all
[1:34:20] there's all of these Doomsday Preppers
[1:34:23] and they're getting ready they had their
[1:34:25] secret stash of supplies if they're
[1:34:28] there water in fact just the other day
[1:34:30] faith went into Costco and they told her
[1:34:32] that they are wiped out of bottled water
[1:34:36] and and disposable paper products
[1:34:39] because everyone's preparing for the
[1:34:41] coronavirus
[1:34:44] you see people want to go get that they
[1:34:49] want to stock up because they're
[1:34:51] thinking of themselves I think in hell
[1:34:53] and what how and what am I gonna do so I
[1:34:56] will survive this so that I will live
[1:35:00] but the believer isn't called to look at
[1:35:03] surviving or how they're gonna live
[1:35:05] because scripture says think not think
[1:35:13] not
[1:35:29] I know I had it in here somewhere but
[1:35:32] Christ was speaking he said not to
[1:35:36] concern yourself oh here it is Matthew
[1:35:40] six wherefore if God so clothe the grass
[1:35:43] of the field which today is and tomorrow
[1:35:45] is cast into the oven shall not he much
[1:35:48] more clothe you O ye of little faith
[1:35:53] therefore take no Thought saying what
[1:35:56] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[1:35:59] wherewithal shall we be clothed for
[1:36:02] after all these things do the Gentiles
[1:36:04] seek for your heavenly Father knoweth
[1:36:07] that you have need of these things but
[1:36:09] seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
[1:36:12] righteousness and all these things will
[1:36:15] be added unto you you see because if we
[1:36:18] were really concerned and we took the
[1:36:20] profit even at his word what he said the
[1:36:23] end time would look like then we would
[1:36:26] be built
[1:36:27] digging the deepest of of safe houses
[1:36:32] bunkers into the ground we would be
[1:36:35] setting aside food and water for years
[1:36:39] because we know even more than anyone
[1:36:43] else that there's a squeeze coming on
[1:36:44] this little bride he said that well
[1:36:47] there'll be a quick short work where the
[1:36:51] bride will have to manifest the spoken
[1:36:54] word for her daily bread so the
[1:37:02] conditions we know what the conditions
[1:37:05] are going to look like now we have to
[1:37:08] know on whether or not we will be there
[1:37:10] ready to meet the conditions or will we
[1:37:17] fall short you see because it says
[1:37:25] Jesus speaking to him he says oh ye of
[1:37:27] little faith he said the reason why
[1:37:33] you're so concerned about all these
[1:37:34] things is because your faith is so small
[1:37:40] he said it's not even great enough to
[1:37:42] believe that God is in control doctor I
[1:37:47] want to hold all these things in to
[1:37:49] myself I can't give it to anybody else
[1:37:51] it'll drain me and that could be
[1:37:55] physically well that could be
[1:37:57] spiritually too you know we get a little
[1:37:59] bit of joy and we're like well I've been
[1:38:02] going through a hard time and I deserve
[1:38:03] to feel happy so I can't give it to
[1:38:06] anybody else because if I do I won't
[1:38:08] have enough for myself or love you got
[1:38:17] God's given you of his love but to
[1:38:21] extend that love is too much for you why
[1:38:24] because we don't have faith that there's
[1:38:27] more of it where it came from
[1:38:28] see God God has an endless supply
[1:38:32] depending on your level of faith it's
[1:38:36] your level of ability to reach into the
[1:38:39] storehouse and believe every time that
[1:38:41] you reach in there'll be enough there
[1:38:43] for you to preserve life just like the
[1:38:46] widow woman during the time of drought
[1:38:49] there she was she was gone one of God's
[1:38:52] Gentile fruit trees you know she was a
[1:38:56] Gentile she wasn't a Jew she was a
[1:39:02] Gentile and she was the only one the
[1:39:04] Prophet was sent to there's a during
[1:39:07] that entire time of drought someone who
[1:39:09] wasn't even a part of the promise for
[1:39:12] her day
[1:39:15] none of the promises belong to her it
[1:39:18] all belonged to the to the children and
[1:39:21] we know because even when Christ came
[1:39:22] and the Gentile woman came after him he
[1:39:25] said how would it be fit for me to cast
[1:39:28] the children's bread on two dogs and yet
[1:39:32] this one was able to grab a hold of
[1:39:35] faith enough to where it caught that
[1:39:38] God's attention during a time of drought
[1:39:42] so much that it brought the only prophet
[1:39:46] in Israel to her house so there was
[1:39:51] something going on and she saw no way
[1:39:54] out but even of that she was still ready
[1:39:57] to give it to somebody else before she
[1:40:00] even had a promise that it would be
[1:40:03] restored
[1:40:04] you see we see there the characteristic
[1:40:08] of Christ was already being portrayed
[1:40:11] before she even had a promise of
[1:40:13] anything else before she had a promise
[1:40:15] that her meal would not run dry of her
[1:40:17] oil not run dry when the prophet of God
[1:40:21] came and said give to me first she said
[1:40:24] I know we're gonna die but since you
[1:40:27] asked for it
[1:40:27] you can have it and that's the attitude
[1:40:33] God wants us to have as bearers of fruit
[1:40:36] in his garden is even when we see no way
[1:40:40] out even when the sky looks books brass
[1:40:44] and judgment is in in the air even when
[1:40:47] we've had no contact we've gone all the
[1:40:50] way she'd made it all the way through
[1:40:52] those years of drought to where she was
[1:40:54] down to nothing and she hadn't heard
[1:40:56] anything from the Lord but here the
[1:41:01] Prophet comes he says you have anything
[1:41:05] and she said I have a little bit he says
[1:41:07] give it to me
[1:41:08] he says she says were always gonna make
[1:41:11] it for me and my son and then we were
[1:41:13] gonna die but since you say you're
[1:41:16] coming in the name of the Lord you can
[1:41:18] have it as a servant of the Lord I'll
[1:41:21] give you what a little bit I have and it
[1:41:25] wasn't until he had actually taken it
[1:41:27] and eaten it partaking of it it was gone
[1:41:30] he turned around and the blessing came
[1:41:33] upon her you see it's not looking to see
[1:41:38] well do I have enough to give do I have
[1:41:42] enough of myself to give do I have
[1:41:45] enough joy to give do I have enough love
[1:41:48] to share do I have enough peace in and
[1:41:51] of myself to
[1:41:52] and out but God's saying when you look
[1:41:57] in the barrel and it looks like it's the
[1:41:59] last thing you have give it anyways
[1:42:03] when you look in and of yourself and you
[1:42:05] say I have nothing left I said that's
[1:42:07] good because the next thing you're gonna
[1:42:09] hand out is something of me you're gonna
[1:42:12] stop giving your opinion and thoughts to
[1:42:15] people and now you're only gonna give
[1:42:20] out what I give you so as I give unto
[1:42:23] you you're gonna be sharing with the
[1:42:25] individuals around you because what you
[1:42:29] were handing out before had no life in
[1:42:32] it had no potential to do any good but
[1:42:37] now now that you got to the bottom of
[1:42:40] your barrel now that you've gotten to
[1:42:42] the bottom of yourself now that I we've
[1:42:44] trimmed all the loose branches and
[1:42:46] deadness out of your tree now as you
[1:42:51] draw forth life from the word and you've
[1:42:55] been to push out all the new growth it's
[1:42:57] all going to be Christ all the fruit
[1:43:00] coming down from the tree is all Christ
[1:43:02] even if it's just the first one coming
[1:43:04] out its Christ whether it's whether the
[1:43:07] tree is full of their shoe
[1:43:09] it's one partakes of it they're gonna
[1:43:11] partake of the life of Christ why
[1:43:13] because that's the life coming up
[1:43:14] through the tree and that's where we
[1:43:17] need to come to is where we've come and
[1:43:20] ask the Lord and say Lord cut out
[1:43:22] anything that is not of yourself
[1:43:24] anything that is a hindrance to my life
[1:43:26] anything not just a hindrance to your
[1:43:29] physical life not a hindrance to your
[1:43:31] your own ability to succeed but a
[1:43:33] hindrance to your life with Christ what
[1:43:36] is coming in the way of you coming into
[1:43:39] communion with the Lord and him coming
[1:43:42] and indwelling in you so that you can be
[1:43:46] a fulfillment of this scripture where he
[1:43:48] says he that believeth on me out of his
[1:43:51] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[1:43:55] rivers he wasn't speaking about a
[1:43:57] trickle he wasn't saying well you know
[1:44:00] every once well as it hits as what I
[1:44:04] give you
[1:44:04] gets it'll splash over
[1:44:06] out of the cup they said there's so much
[1:44:08] and you'll be so yielded as it pouring
[1:44:12] in it'll be pouring out there will be no
[1:44:15] way to stop it it'll just take over in
[1:44:19] and of yourself what you you would have
[1:44:21] been thinking well you know that brother
[1:44:25] he really offended me and I'm gonna go
[1:44:27] let him know and about the time you walk
[1:44:29] up God says no this is what I'm pouring
[1:44:32] into you and also in what pours out
[1:44:34] wasn't what you were thinking but what
[1:44:36] God just poured in and now the grace of
[1:44:38] God is extended now God's love is
[1:44:41] extended why because it's it's taken
[1:44:44] over it's taken over your life it's
[1:44:46] taking over your thoughts it's taken
[1:44:48] over your beam it's taken over your
[1:44:51] spirit it's in control in your soul and
[1:44:55] it's just coming out of you you can't
[1:44:57] stop it you see there's been those
[1:45:00] throughout scripture that that happened
[1:45:03] to just once and they had no control
[1:45:05] over because God wouldn't let them
[1:45:08] falsely prophesy
[1:45:10] it was Balaam you see he went up there
[1:45:17] and he had a thought in his own mind for
[1:45:19] cursing
[1:45:21] he said I've seen the backside of these
[1:45:24] people and I know they deserved to be
[1:45:26] cursed because that's what seeing the
[1:45:31] backside is all about seeing someone's
[1:45:33] backside is seeing their worst seem that
[1:45:36] the the their their worst attitude seen
[1:45:40] their seeing them on their worst day
[1:45:42] when everything's going wrong for them
[1:45:44] and and you you say hello brothers look
[1:45:46] don't talk to me
[1:45:47] you know it's like God bless you and
[1:45:51] you're like oh wow
[1:45:52] okay it seems someone in their failings
[1:46:00] and Balaam saw all that the reason why
[1:46:03] he wanted to see that because he wanted
[1:46:05] to curse he wanted to put a curse upon
[1:46:07] them but God had already told him he
[1:46:11] said you only say what I put in your
[1:46:12] mouth you'll only say what I put in your
[1:46:15] mouth and when he came forth for
[1:46:17] cursings
[1:46:18] blessings poured out
[1:46:20] you see and that's what we're called to
[1:46:23] do is get this flesh so under the
[1:46:30] control of the Holy Spirit that this
[1:46:32] flesh we want to rise up and go forth
[1:46:35] and go forth is cursings but the Holy
[1:46:38] Spirit would come in and take control
[1:46:40] that see and say no no not cursings
[1:46:43] blessings you say but lord look at what
[1:46:46] they did to me look at what they did to
[1:46:49] me here's here is the first martyr of
[1:46:57] the church being stoned Stephen he
[1:47:05] preached a fiery message fiery message
[1:47:08] and they were angry and they dragged him
[1:47:12] out and toss him down now
[1:47:19] I know he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:21] he just come from a powerful sermon but
[1:47:27] his flesh wasn't looking forward to the
[1:47:29] stoning but he had to put forth the
[1:47:37] fruits of the life that was inside him
[1:47:40] and so when the flesh would cry out for
[1:47:44] cursings the spirit that was inside of
[1:47:49] him when called out and said lord lay
[1:47:53] not this sin against them
[1:47:57] Leyna lay this not to their charge and
[1:48:02] in that moment it says he gave up the
[1:48:05] ghost it doesn't even say the stoning
[1:48:07] killed him it says in that moment God
[1:48:10] just took his spirit from him you see
[1:48:17] there had to be something there that
[1:48:19] could be more powerful that could be
[1:48:24] expressed because he'd already been
[1:48:27] through the purging so that once he was
[1:48:31] in that state now the only thing that
[1:48:33] could push forth his new life
[1:48:34] the old man was there's nothing left so
[1:48:38] the only thing that can push forth his
[1:48:40] new life new life new life is coming
[1:48:44] forth and that life can only produce the
[1:48:48] fruit that's in the life just like the
[1:48:52] the grafted tree the grafted piece into
[1:48:56] the tree can only produce the life
[1:48:58] that's in the graph so that graph was
[1:49:03] originally meant to produce a tangerine
[1:49:05] even though it's attached to an orange
[1:49:07] tree it'll produce that tangerine you
[1:49:12] see and so is it with us is we were
[1:49:17] originally a part of that tree of life
[1:49:20] so even though we look like a grafted
[1:49:24] we've been grafted into this world and
[1:49:26] attached this old tree this tree of
[1:49:30] knowledge of good and evil but when the
[1:49:33] life pours through into the original
[1:49:36] branch has to pour forth the original
[1:49:40] life so dukh just because you're
[1:49:43] attached to the old tree doesn't give
[1:49:46] you excuses to produce old fruit because
[1:49:52] you're supposed to reach back to your
[1:49:53] identity of who you were from before the
[1:49:56] foundation of the world and produce the
[1:49:58] fruit that you produce back there so
[1:50:02] God's calling on you to produce fruit
[1:50:04] and he as the husbandmen will come in
[1:50:07] and he's going to come in and begin
[1:50:10] cutting things out of your life you look
[1:50:12] at your life look back even where you're
[1:50:14] at right now whether you're young or old
[1:50:16] and you can see where God has done
[1:50:18] things and been shaping you and you look
[1:50:21] at Mackey and say Lord why why did I go
[1:50:23] through that why why did you even you
[1:50:27] look at even your failings God allow you
[1:50:29] to go through those failings because
[1:50:32] he's raising you up because he wants you
[1:50:33] to produce a fruit and if you'd never
[1:50:36] gone through that that he wouldn't have
[1:50:38] been ill cut those things out of your
[1:50:40] life and they'd be hanging on but he had
[1:50:44] reasons for shaping you the certain way
[1:50:47] that he has is because he knows by
[1:50:49] shaping you into that condition you're
[1:50:52] gonna produce the most fruit so here you
[1:50:55] can look back to your life and you can
[1:50:57] see these things that you've gone
[1:50:58] through and you can see your the path
[1:51:01] you've walked and we look at well and we
[1:51:04] look at it we go well it goes up to me
[1:51:06] and with with 20/20 if I could go back
[1:51:10] and redo it I would skip this part now
[1:51:13] to make a different decision here and
[1:51:14] I'd make a better decision over here
[1:51:16] that way I wouldn't make this mistake
[1:51:18] but you know that mistake was a part of
[1:51:21] God's pruning just like Joseph's just
[1:51:25] like Moses the mistake was a part of the
[1:51:29] pruning because he wanted to take you
[1:51:32] somewhere to remove that from your life
[1:51:34] so he allowed you to go there because he
[1:51:38] perfectly made that trial specifically
[1:51:42] for you because he was gonna use it to
[1:51:46] shape you he was shaping character you
[1:51:49] see he wasn't concerned with how good
[1:51:52] you looked he wasn't concerned with your
[1:51:55] prestige he wasn't even concerned about
[1:51:59] your your own your own
[1:52:10] I'm missing the word but with how you
[1:52:14] look to everyone else with your own
[1:52:17] reputation thank you he's not concerned
[1:52:20] with your reputation spiritually he's
[1:52:22] not concerned about your reputation
[1:52:23] physically he's not concerned he's not
[1:52:27] concerned that you grew up in a perfect
[1:52:29] message Church in a perfect message
[1:52:30] family and and you've heard how how God
[1:52:35] and the Prophet and the ministers all
[1:52:37] come forces they'd you know the most
[1:52:39] precious thing is just that one that
[1:52:41] never had to go out into the world you
[1:52:43] know the devil uses that against you
[1:52:46] he'll come to you and say you have to
[1:52:48] meet that mark that you look right to
[1:52:52] maintain the reputation not just your
[1:52:54] reputation but your reputation is is
[1:52:57] hinging on the reputation of the church
[1:52:59] and the ramification of your pastor and
[1:53:02] the reputation of your family and he's
[1:53:05] gonna hold that over you why as long as
[1:53:06] you can hold that over you
[1:53:08] it'll never allow you to go to that
[1:53:10] place where God was gonna use to prune
[1:53:13] things out of your life and shape that
[1:53:15] tree so you could produce fruit they'd
[1:53:18] be a blessing to others later see
[1:53:20] because his whole God's whole thing
[1:53:22] isn't about worrying about how you look
[1:53:24] or worrying about what other people
[1:53:26] think about you or wearing what the
[1:53:27] pastor thought about it or worrying
[1:53:29] about what some other individual thought
[1:53:31] his whole purpose was as I know at a
[1:53:34] certain point this fruit trees life I
[1:53:37] want them to produce a certain type of
[1:53:40] fruit because there was gonna be someone
[1:53:42] who needs that kind of fruit at that
[1:53:45] time and stage of life you see and so to
[1:53:49] get you produced that quality of fruit
[1:53:51] he has to walk you through this way that
[1:53:54] even to you you're looking at and you're
[1:53:55] like with the decisions and the things
[1:53:58] that I'm doing I'm lost I know it and
[1:54:02] the devil comes to remind me every day
[1:54:04] you see but God had that in his plan the
[1:54:09] whole time you know why because
[1:54:11] scripture says the steps of the
[1:54:13] righteous are ordered of the Lord now
[1:54:16] immediately most people think the
[1:54:18] righteous well that's after conversion
[1:54:21] but the steps of the
[1:54:23] were of the righteous before conversion
[1:54:26] because he says you were his sons and
[1:54:29] daughters before the foundation of the
[1:54:31] world
[1:54:31] you were righteous in his sight back
[1:54:33] there and your steps were ordered of the
[1:54:37] Lord from the day you were born in fact
[1:54:42] it was so ordered that even your mom and
[1:54:46] dad your grandparents your
[1:54:49] great-grandparents their steps were
[1:54:51] ordered to come together even if they
[1:54:56] never were to produce the life of Christ
[1:54:58] they were carrying something that had to
[1:55:01] be manifested which was you and I which
[1:55:05] was to carry God's own life and he
[1:55:08] watched over that carefully so don't
[1:55:11] think that after he's washed over that
[1:55:12] seed for six thousand years after the
[1:55:15] mix-up in the garden that he's waited
[1:55:18] for the last sixty years of that six
[1:55:20] thousand to lose you because even back
[1:55:24] there before the foundation of the world
[1:55:26] at the time of the fall he saw you
[1:55:29] brother Steve he saw you brother Joseph
[1:55:32] he saw me for the dam
[1:55:35] loyal he saw us in Arma his mind and he
[1:55:40] saw he said that that right there is a
[1:55:43] son of God that right there is a
[1:55:45] daughter of God not only that but they
[1:55:48] are being called to the hardest to the
[1:55:52] most trying time but also to the time
[1:55:55] when the most fruit will be produced in
[1:55:57] the life of the believer because this is
[1:55:59] a time of restoration of the bride tree
[1:56:02] with a bride tree will come to a point
[1:56:04] of a restoration of knowing who she is
[1:56:06] and brother Ram said when the bride
[1:56:09] recognizes who she is she'll be an
[1:56:11] invincible army now it's not because
[1:56:14] she's not an invincible army but because
[1:56:17] when she recognizes who she is
[1:56:19] and her place in Christ as she steps out
[1:56:21] day by day as the Spirit reveals to her
[1:56:24] who she is as she steps out of that
[1:56:26] spiritual amnesia the fruit of the
[1:56:28] Spirit can't help but be manifested
[1:56:30] because that life that was in the
[1:56:32] individual from before the foundation of
[1:56:34] time when the sons of God
[1:56:36] for joy and meaning you were there
[1:56:38] shouting for joy with the sons of God
[1:56:41] so is it now we're coming back to a full
[1:56:46] restoration of the garden where we're
[1:56:48] coming back to the spoken word in the
[1:56:50] life of the believer which we hear the
[1:56:52] spoken word but what does that mean we
[1:56:55] know what that means in the 5
[1:56:56] manifestations of the wave sheaf of the
[1:57:00] producing of fruit because we know a
[1:57:02] wave sheaf does everyone know what a
[1:57:05] wave sheaf is what is a wave sheaf
[1:57:09] anyone firstfruits so do you know why
[1:57:16] they waved they called it the wave sheaf
[1:57:19] they would take that first fruit and go
[1:57:24] before the field the entire field of
[1:57:27] that same type of seed and they would
[1:57:34] wave it over the field they would wave
[1:57:38] it over the field do you know why they
[1:57:39] waved it over the field because they
[1:57:43] wanted all the rest of the field to
[1:57:45] catch a glimpse of what they were to be
[1:57:48] and what they were to produce and so we
[1:57:52] had a wave sheaf come in our time a
[1:57:54] fruit tree that was allowed to come to a
[1:57:57] full manifestation of fruit bearing age
[1:57:59] producing fruit on the tree so that we
[1:58:03] could see that wave before us not so
[1:58:07] that we could idolize the tree not so
[1:58:10] that we could lift up the trees but so
[1:58:12] we could recognize I too am a fruit tree
[1:58:15] I too am called to produce that same
[1:58:18] line where the spoken word came in and
[1:58:22] he was able to speak to nature and speak
[1:58:25] to that bull and I don't let love come
[1:58:27] forth and speak and say bull I didn't
[1:58:31] mean now wait a minute wait a minute do
[1:58:34] you know that's not the first thing he
[1:58:35] thought about you know that was early on
[1:58:40] in himself he was still thinking way to
[1:58:44] fleshly because the first thing he did
[1:58:47] his first plan of
[1:58:49] attack the Scot was his gun but you know
[1:58:54] what God had already done that gun that
[1:58:56] he carried with him everywhere God had
[1:58:59] made sure he left it in the truck
[1:59:01] and let him get halfway into the field
[1:59:03] before they even saw the bull or the
[1:59:06] bull saw him because first of all if he
[1:59:09] would have seen the bull he would have
[1:59:10] walked around the field and avoided it
[1:59:13] altogether
[1:59:13] you see God put him in that position on
[1:59:18] purpose
[1:59:18] because he was building faith and he
[1:59:21] does that with me in you he will put us
[1:59:24] in the field with the bull without
[1:59:26] telling us because he wants us to get
[1:59:31] there and he wants us we might at first
[1:59:35] we're like where'd that gun where's that
[1:59:37] extra money I hid under the mattress
[1:59:38] where's for that trial because that's
[1:59:45] gonna be our first response but he knows
[1:59:47] when when all that comes up short then
[1:59:50] we're gonna go well I guess that's it
[1:59:54] it's over for me that's what he said I
[1:59:56] said I know I can't outrun him I guess
[1:59:58] this is where it all ends and it wasn't
[2:00:01] till the bull was charging at foot at a
[2:00:04] dead run in his direction that something
[2:00:07] rose up inside him to meet the challenge
[2:00:09] of the day to meet the need of the hour
[2:00:12] it wasn't something he had when he
[2:00:14] started at the field
[2:00:15] it wasn't something he had even when he
[2:00:17] first saw the bull when he saw the
[2:00:19] problem it wasn't until the problem was
[2:00:22] about to hit him dead on as something
[2:00:24] came up and spoke and it came out in
[2:00:27] humility and humility with authority out
[2:00:30] of love it wasn't you bull you have no
[2:00:34] right I'm a son of God go back you see
[2:00:38] that would be the wrong approach
[2:00:39] I said bull I'm gonna have to ask you to
[2:00:46] forgive me because I've I've come here
[2:00:49] and disturbed you but I'm a son of God
[2:00:52] going across to pick to pray for one of
[2:00:55] his sick children now it in the name of
[2:00:59] the Lord
[2:01:00] going lay down
[2:01:02] you see the approach the approach to the
[2:01:04] problem wasn't one a panic and wasn't
[2:01:08] one of bravado
[2:01:09] it wasn't trying to show off it was just
[2:01:12] that love of God reaching out and taking
[2:01:15] control that situation we see what else
[2:01:19] would do what each wave sheaf do when
[2:01:22] the wave sheaf came and the spoken word
[2:01:24] came forth and and fruit was produced
[2:01:27] he spoke life into existence he spoke
[2:01:31] life into existence those squirrels the
[2:01:37] Spirit came the Lord came to him and
[2:01:38] said whatever you say will be done okay
[2:01:44] and it was the number he called for and
[2:01:48] how many he called for that produced but
[2:01:54] the Lord wouldn't let him leave one of
[2:01:56] them when he was hunting because one was
[2:01:59] getting away he said no you're gonna
[2:02:01] take every single piece of evidence of
[2:02:08] this home with you so that no not once
[2:02:13] when you tell the testimony to everyone
[2:02:15] around you say aye
[2:02:16] I believe it was seven and you say
[2:02:19] seventh they said but I ran you only
[2:02:20] have six squirrels I think you're making
[2:02:23] something up he said no you're gonna
[2:02:25] take all all of them home with you okay
[2:02:30] God's building his faith building his
[2:02:33] faith building his faith he's working
[2:02:36] him up to a place where first everything
[2:02:38] is hands-on in location he could see it
[2:02:41] happening he can touch it but he's
[2:02:44] working him to something and he's
[2:02:46] working him to the same faith that
[2:02:47] that's the Centurion had when he came to
[2:02:50] Jesus and he said I am a man of
[2:02:54] authority and when I speak with
[2:02:56] authority those who hear it has to
[2:02:58] listen and I know you also are a man of
[2:03:01] authority so if you speak it it's done
[2:03:03] already and Jesus at that time he said
[2:03:06] paint like this have I never seen in all
[2:03:07] of Israel but that was a faith that
[2:03:10] brother Branham was being brought to you
[2:03:14] is not just something he could see but
[2:03:18] something that he would speak it and
[2:03:20] know it was already done you see because
[2:03:24] he did that and he comes forth and he
[2:03:26] God showing them that no matter what
[2:03:28] when love projects it's in control
[2:03:31] whether it's speaking to a bowl in the
[2:03:33] field whether it's bringing forth life
[2:03:35] new life whether it's speaking to a
[2:03:39] maniac on the platform and stopping the
[2:03:41] devil right in his tracks whether it's
[2:03:45] speaking to sin and rebuking it it takes
[2:03:49] full control that young couple on the
[2:03:51] front row love projected and took full
[2:03:56] control of the situation and a little
[2:03:59] bit at a time but the last manifestation
[2:04:01] was sister Mita you know she had that
[2:04:06] growth on her ovaries I believe and
[2:04:10] brother Branham had been seen it for
[2:04:12] years and wasn't until after that
[2:04:15] incident where she disrespected the
[2:04:17] sermon Oh God and the Lord wasn't
[2:04:19] pleased with it that that thing began to
[2:04:21] manifest itself it been sitting there
[2:04:24] sitting there waiting why you see God
[2:04:27] knew and he could show his prophet what
[2:04:30] trial she was gonna go through before it
[2:04:33] even manifested so don't think your
[2:04:35] trial just happened by accident God has
[2:04:40] it tailor-made for you knowing the
[2:04:43] reaction you'll have in the decisions
[2:04:45] you'll make because he's shaping you up
[2:04:47] even all these ones where you made you
[2:04:49] look at you like I made the wrong
[2:04:50] decision he's shaping your characters
[2:04:53] when you face that again you be like no
[2:04:55] I know what decision I made before and I
[2:04:57] know where it took me
[2:04:58] no turn to go the other way and he's
[2:05:01] shaping you shaping you he did that with
[2:05:03] the Prophet the Prophet made decisions
[2:05:06] that he shouldn't know that's what
[2:05:07] happened the beginning of his ministry
[2:05:08] he was a tree needing to be pruned and
[2:05:11] there he went he was being drawn monks
[2:05:14] the Pretender coastal people right and
[2:05:16] his mother-in-law said don't you drag my
[2:05:19] daughter out amongst that trash and he
[2:05:24] said fine I won't
[2:05:25] that's how great his his revelation of
[2:05:28] faith was at that point and God said no
[2:05:31] if you're gonna come to the spoken word
[2:05:34] your revelation is gonna be a lot
[2:05:35] stronger than that it's gonna have to be
[2:05:38] a lot stronger than that so guess what I
[2:05:41] have some tailor-made trials that you're
[2:05:43] gonna go through that's gonna trim the
[2:05:45] tree to the point where the only thing
[2:05:49] it can produce his life and it went so
[2:05:53] low so low he went so low to the point
[2:05:59] in his life where he twice tried to do
[2:06:04] something that we would consider
[2:06:05] despicable most of the Christian
[2:06:09] community and world at large doesn't
[2:06:11] still doesn't know what to do with
[2:06:12] anyone or someone that does this he
[2:06:16] tried to take his own life twice twice
[2:06:20] he was the point where his tree had been
[2:06:23] so trimmed it was down to the almost
[2:06:26] down to a stump of what was left because
[2:06:30] God said I'm gonna take you down to
[2:06:32] nothing just like the bride tree over
[2:06:35] the ages right
[2:06:35] it was stripped of everything because
[2:06:38] God said I'm gonna build it back up from
[2:06:40] nothing so everything in it is of me
[2:06:43] it's word upon word upon word upon line
[2:06:47] upon line upon line no part of man is
[2:06:50] gonna be left everything is gonna be
[2:06:52] Christ upon Christ glory upon glory upon
[2:06:56] glory upon glory because he's building
[2:06:58] this church to get out of here
[2:07:00] he's building it up to a capstone of
[2:07:02] love we know that
[2:07:04] capstone was Christ coming down crying
[2:07:06] love crying grace grace grace to the
[2:07:09] believer but what was it what was Christ
[2:07:12] coming down to do an indwelling of the
[2:07:15] bride because it says the spirit and the
[2:07:19] bride say come
[2:07:20] and and the bride was gonna be the final
[2:07:24] voice to the final age Christ a
[2:07:27] manifestation of Christ on this earth
[2:07:31] the very life of Christ in the life of
[2:07:34] the believer so here he is he's got to
[2:07:36] trim it down and shape it
[2:07:38] and get it to the place was the only
[2:07:41] thing left now is Christ building on
[2:07:45] Christ building so here it is the
[2:07:48] prophet got to the point where he was
[2:07:50] torn down to nothing and he said and he
[2:07:54] had to get to that point where he
[2:07:56] removed any tie that would stop him from
[2:08:01] taking God at His Word and stepping out
[2:08:03] on his Commission and doing what God had
[2:08:05] called him to do so it is with me and
[2:08:08] you were not any less you see when the
[2:08:10] wave sheaf of his wave we see the fruit
[2:08:12] we see it in its end condition and we
[2:08:15] all like yeah that's what I want to be I
[2:08:17] want to produce that fruit but then we
[2:08:20] turn around and we look at all the
[2:08:23] pruning the tree went through and we're
[2:08:24] like we don't want that I don't I don't
[2:08:27] want anything to do with that because
[2:08:30] that's what the rich young ruler did he
[2:08:32] got to that place and he came and he
[2:08:33] said I want eternal life what can I do
[2:08:36] to gain eternal life I am willing to do
[2:08:39] anything I keep the law i from the time
[2:08:43] of my youth I've kept the law I've done
[2:08:46] everything I know to do right and Jesus
[2:08:49] said yeah you've done everything you
[2:08:52] know but there's way too much dead
[2:08:56] weight in your tree he said go sell all
[2:08:59] that you have come and follow me
[2:09:02] he said no no I want eternal life but
[2:09:07] not if that's what it costs me I don't
[2:09:11] want to be a partaker of the tree of
[2:09:15] life if that's what it cost me
[2:09:19] but God will take every individual to
[2:09:22] that place where they get to the point
[2:09:24] where they go I had where you are called
[2:09:29] on where it's give everything for life
[2:09:36] that's what the parables were all about
[2:09:38] when when the merchant of pearls wanted
[2:09:43] to buy the pearl of great price he had
[2:09:46] to give up all of his own pearls to gain
[2:09:48] it he couldn't keep any of his own if he
[2:09:54] wanted to attain the pearl of great
[2:09:56] price to attain the fruit of the Spirit
[2:10:00] you say how do i how do i attain how do
[2:10:03] i produce the fruits of the spirit well
[2:10:05] there is no secret formula to how you
[2:10:08] produce joy there isn't some way well if
[2:10:11] I do this and I'm just really happy and
[2:10:12] I'm really positive and I ever you know
[2:10:15] real positive outlook on life and you
[2:10:18] know the power of positive thinking
[2:10:20] there's no joy that's not joy guess what
[2:10:23] you're gonna break eventually love you
[2:10:28] think wow I just love everybody I could
[2:10:30] just wait wait long enough somebody will
[2:10:33] do something where your love will come
[2:10:35] to an end you're like well you know I do
[2:10:39] yoga and I meditate and so I'm just real
[2:10:41] peaceful guess what there is no there's
[2:10:44] no way that you can produce even one of
[2:10:49] these things you can't you cannot
[2:10:55] produce a one a fruit of the Spirit
[2:10:58] there's not one flew the spirit that you
[2:11:00] can produce of yourself he's calling you
[2:11:04] and saying give up all of yourself so I
[2:11:09] can pour all of myself into you and then
[2:11:12] you don't have to worry how do I produce
[2:11:14] the fruit of the Spirit because the when
[2:11:16] that tree of life is imparted into you
[2:11:21] and you begin to produce the fruit of
[2:11:24] the tree of life you bear fruit because
[2:11:28] the life and the nutrients you're taking
[2:11:31] up you see if the tree didn't you ever
[2:11:33] get anything it would just wither and
[2:11:35] die in its spot but what it is drawing
[2:11:40] up into itself that is producing the
[2:11:43] life in the tree that's producing the
[2:11:45] fruit so you just get the life in you
[2:11:48] and don't worry
[2:11:50] the fruit will produce allow the drink
[2:11:54] of the water of the word and that that
[2:11:58] valley of rivers of living water that
[2:12:00] pours forth from you you won't be able
[2:12:02] to stop it but too much of a time we
[2:12:09] don't let the husbandmen do the pruning
[2:12:11] we want to hold on to it even if he
[2:12:15] proves that we want to stack all those
[2:12:16] dead limbs at the bottom of our tree so
[2:12:18] that we can at least look back to them
[2:12:20] and remember them and feel good about
[2:12:22] ourselves maybe it was one of your
[2:12:25] accomplishments in life you want to
[2:12:28] stack that up it's dead if you allow
[2:12:30] that dead wood it's dead at the bottom
[2:12:32] of your tree it's a fire hazard
[2:12:34] and it's gonna consume you and destroy
[2:12:38] you
[2:12:39] don't do it yield yield say Lord Lord
[2:12:44] whatever you got to do if you got a
[2:12:47] shake the tree if you got to trim the
[2:12:50] tree if you got it remove even the limbs
[2:12:54] that I love the most that's what he did
[2:12:59] to the wave sheaf he removed the limbs
[2:13:02] he loved the most his wife and his
[2:13:08] little girl gone God Room God removed
[2:13:14] them because he was shaping the tree to
[2:13:17] produce fruit it wasn't because the
[2:13:20] Prophet did anything wrong but he was
[2:13:23] concerned the spirit was concerned that
[2:13:27] that tree would not produce the fruit it
[2:13:29] needed you as they didn't go through
[2:13:30] that every step every little part of his
[2:13:35] life that he went through was focusing
[2:13:38] on producing fruit there's not there's
[2:13:40] not one step folks that we've gone
[2:13:41] through in our lives that had any other
[2:13:43] purpose than what God is shaping us to
[2:13:46] produce fruit and here we are we are
[2:13:48] called to this city to this church to
[2:13:52] this assembly you're called to be
[2:13:54] sitting where you're sitting
[2:13:55] you've been called to go through all the
[2:13:58] things in life that brought you to this
[2:13:59] place I've been called to go through all
[2:14:01] the things I've gone through in life
[2:14:03] to bring me right here to this place I
[2:14:05] can look back and I see Lord why why
[2:14:09] couldn't I just receive it why couldn't
[2:14:11] I have just seen it why did I have to go
[2:14:13] through those struggles why did I have
[2:14:15] to face the enemy in that way why they
[2:14:18] had to come to such a place of feeling
[2:14:21] so lost and so depressed thinking I have
[2:14:24] no way out why cuz he's got a reason he
[2:14:28] wants me to prove some type of fruit he
[2:14:31] wants to come to a place where he where
[2:14:33] I can shared the fruit you know what
[2:14:34] kind of fruit that that shares is no
[2:14:37] matter what you're going through God can
[2:14:39] bring you through if I if I never gone
[2:14:42] through that then I'd never look back
[2:14:44] and see what God had brought me through
[2:14:46] I couldn't share that with you if I'd
[2:14:50] never have been in a place where I felt
[2:14:52] always lost if you came to me and said
[2:14:54] you know it's done it's over always lost
[2:14:57] there's nothing that can save me I'd be
[2:15:00] like well you might be right
[2:15:03] especially after you just shared what
[2:15:05] you shared with me I'm pretty sure you
[2:15:07] have no coming back like I've read in
[2:15:11] the Bible about there's a sin that you
[2:15:12] shouldn't even pray for and you do your
[2:15:17] own praying this time I'm not going to
[2:15:20] get caught up in that one because you
[2:15:24] know I gotta watch out for myself I
[2:15:26] don't want to pray for you and not be
[2:15:28] supposed to be praying for you and God
[2:15:29] get mad at me but I know I've been to
[2:15:34] that place where I was those I could go
[2:15:38] no lower and looking up and God said
[2:15:41] you're still mine you're still mine
[2:15:44] don't think don't think that you could
[2:15:46] go solo that's why he did that he
[2:15:54] brought me to a place where all those I
[2:15:58] knew all the friends I've ever had in my
[2:16:01] life were ripped from me in a 24-hour
[2:16:05] period
[2:16:07] and knowing that they all thought I'd
[2:16:11] become the Antichrist and gone to the
[2:16:14] devil
[2:16:16] and I and you look at that when you're
[2:16:19] going through that and you say Lord
[2:16:21] what's going on what's going on Here I
[2:16:25] am I'm all alone how do I bear this how
[2:16:30] do I bear this he said you can bear it
[2:16:33] because I'm your friend I'm your
[2:16:38] exceeding great reward and so now anyone
[2:16:42] else who says you know what I'm without
[2:16:44] a friend in the world nobody cares about
[2:16:46] me and I can look at them in the eye and
[2:16:50] say that's an absolute lie of the devil
[2:16:54] because as long as you have Christ you
[2:16:57] have a friend who cares for you more
[2:16:59] than your brother more than more than so
[2:17:09] begin looking in back into your life and
[2:17:11] stop looking at it as as those are
[2:17:13] horrible things that happen to me or
[2:17:15] horrible things I did and begin looking
[2:17:17] at it say Lord based on what you wrought
[2:17:19] me through what kind of fruit are you
[2:17:21] wanting me to produce and who is it I
[2:17:24] should be sharing that fruit with
[2:17:26] because he brought you through that to
[2:17:29] produce a fruit to share it with
[2:17:31] somebody he didn't call you to hide it a
[2:17:35] light that was put on a hills to be
[2:17:39] shared it's not a light to be hidden
[2:17:41] under a bushel
[2:17:43] so is that tree as you're producing
[2:17:46] fruit you're supposed to be sharing it
[2:17:48] with those around you so you - you know
[2:17:51] what you've been through in life look
[2:17:53] back take a look say God why did you
[2:17:56] take me through that you know we know
[2:18:00] the Prophet talks about he he went to
[2:18:02] the Lord one time and he had prayed for
[2:18:04] a sister and the sister didn't get any
[2:18:06] better and she passed away and really
[2:18:10] ran and went to the Lord and said Lord
[2:18:11] I demand an answer but the man said the
[2:18:15] Lord didn't speak to me for six months
[2:18:16] until I said Lord you don't owe me
[2:18:19] anything and the Lord told him he said
[2:18:24] that sister you prayed for did what he
[2:18:27] think was about a year or six months
[2:18:29] four so had been in a some type of
[2:18:31] boating accident
[2:18:33] he said she was meant to die then but
[2:18:35] she wasn't she should have drowned but
[2:18:38] she wasn't it wasn't her time and she
[2:18:40] wasn't ready said so this was just she's
[2:18:46] ready I took her home and I don't owe
[2:18:49] you an answer to nothing okay and I say
[2:18:52] that to set the president for this is
[2:18:54] many times if we've been in the message
[2:18:57] long enough we've heard that people say
[2:18:59] well God don't owe you an answer for
[2:19:01] nothing and that's the truth but I think
[2:19:07] the devil puts that out there as a
[2:19:08] scarecrow to stop you from asking Lord
[2:19:11] why not why because poor me or not why
[2:19:16] because I don't deserve this and not why
[2:19:18] for I deserve an answer but Lord why is
[2:19:23] it that I've gone through this why is it
[2:19:27] I'm going through this what purpose do
[2:19:30] you have in it for me for your kingdom
[2:19:33] because we know God never does anything
[2:19:36] without a purpose so if he's doing
[2:19:39] something and we know the trials of your
[2:19:41] faith at greater than gold that he's got
[2:19:44] a purpose because you know that means
[2:19:45] he's making an investment in you and
[2:19:47] anyone who makes an investment in
[2:19:50] someone or something is it expecting a
[2:19:53] return just like the parable of the
[2:19:57] talents were the master left he left one
[2:20:01] with ten and one with five and one with
[2:20:02] one when he came back he wanted to see
[2:20:06] what did you what fruit from these
[2:20:09] talents did you produce it wasn't just
[2:20:13] keep these talents so if he's in he's
[2:20:15] investing in you and the way you know
[2:20:17] he's investing is if you're going
[2:20:18] through a trial if you're going through
[2:20:20] a trial God's making an investment in
[2:20:23] your life isn't that amazing
[2:20:26] that's great so if if if things are
[2:20:33] going too easy just start praying for
[2:20:35] God to invest some more because he's got
[2:20:37] more to invest
[2:20:39] because he's wants something he wants
[2:20:42] two out of that investment he wants a
[2:20:45] return he's looking for a return of
[2:20:47] fruit in your life so my challenge to
[2:20:51] each of you tonight is begin looking at
[2:20:54] God's investments in your life and now
[2:20:57] ask him why say Lord why is it you
[2:21:01] invested in this way in my life and what
[2:21:06] return are you looking for for me to
[2:21:09] produce if musicians would come what
[2:21:13] return are you looking for because God
[2:21:21] never invest you know and people invest
[2:21:24] all the time in different ways depending
[2:21:27] on how they're investing it depends on
[2:21:29] what they're looking for in their return
[2:21:32] so is it in your life God puts you
[2:21:35] through individual unique trials because
[2:21:38] in his investment he's looking for an
[2:21:40] individual unique return I got one quote
[2:21:45] for you and this is where Christ where
[2:21:49] God's trying to bring us all to here in
[2:21:52] the producing of fruit here at this end
[2:21:55] time and it says brother Branham if the
[2:21:59] rising of the Sun 1965 and as he being
[2:22:04] the groom the bride has to come forth
[2:22:06] because it's part of him it can only be
[2:22:09] the manifestation of the fulfilling of
[2:22:11] all the revelations any other has spoke
[2:22:15] of the bride all the revelations spoke
[2:22:18] of the bride
[2:22:19] throughout eons of time that's the fruit
[2:22:23] you're called to produce because that's
[2:22:25] what who were identifying with we are
[2:22:27] the Bride of Christ so what we got to do
[2:22:30] is look and see what is the bride meant
[2:22:32] to produce because she is flesh of his
[2:22:36] flesh bone of his bone life of his life
[2:22:39] power of his power
[2:22:42] she is him there's no there's no
[2:22:46] in-between
[2:22:47] even he when he stood there with his
[2:22:50] disciples they said Lord show us
[2:22:51] Father and he said have I been with you
[2:22:55] so long and you do not know me and it
[2:23:00] says they hated him because he being a
[2:23:03] man was not thought it not robbery to be
[2:23:10] equal with God and here he is he's
[2:23:16] calling us to that same thing he's
[2:23:18] identifying us in the word flesh of his
[2:23:20] flesh bone of his bone life of his life
[2:23:23] power of his power
[2:23:24] she is him and that's why the world will
[2:23:28] hate you it's because you're able to
[2:23:30] identify yourself in the word and see
[2:23:36] yourself as a manifestation of Christ
[2:23:38] and if someone was to say can you show
[2:23:42] me Christ can you show me the Lord you'd
[2:23:47] be able to turn to them with confidence
[2:23:48] of saying Here I am have I walked
[2:23:52] amongst you so long that you do not know
[2:23:54] me it's not a prideful thing it's
[2:23:59] recognizing the very life inside you
[2:24:02] that should be producing now if people
[2:24:05] aren't seeing that then that bears
[2:24:08] witness to us that maybe we should be
[2:24:09] looking deeper we should be going smord
[2:24:12] why am I not producing a fruit that
[2:24:14] those who would look and see would be
[2:24:15] like is that him is that him I can't
[2:24:20] quite tell I can't make it out it's a
[2:24:22] little bit blurry to me that sure looks
[2:24:24] like Jesus
[2:24:28] because they did it with the profit they
[2:24:31] saw him in fact they did with all the
[2:24:33] profits that came in the time of Christ
[2:24:35] John the Baptist they said are you him
[2:24:37] he said no I'm not him he's still coming
[2:24:40] they did it to the profit of this age
[2:24:42] are you Christ he said no I'm not Christ
[2:24:44] and we're not Christ
[2:24:47] we're not Jesus Christ
[2:24:51] we're not the man we're something even
[2:24:55] greater I would say we are the
[2:24:58] manifestation we are many many many
[2:25:01] membered Body of Christ
[2:25:03] manifesting to the world see when he
[2:25:06] came he was just one that's why he said
[2:25:09] what I do show you do also and greater
[2:25:11] than I do shall you too now he had
[2:25:14] raised the dead he had healed cancer
[2:25:17] everything everything you can think of
[2:25:20] he had done but greater because there's
[2:25:24] be more of you and as you step out on
[2:25:29] the word and speak the word it's not
[2:25:30] just the disciples waiting for Jesus to
[2:25:32] come back down off the mountain because
[2:25:35] they can't speak to the Apple the demand
[2:25:39] with epileptic fit but it's a Christ in
[2:25:42] you not waiting but letting Christ and
[2:25:45] you rise up and speaking to that thing
[2:25:47] and saying in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:25:50] our Lord and commanding it speaking to
[2:25:54] it that's what the wave sheaf did it
[2:25:56] came to a point where that growth that
[2:25:58] spirit that was on that growth that was
[2:26:00] attacking to our sister Mita he prayed
[2:26:03] he didn't tell nobody about it no one
[2:26:05] else knew he has sprayed the Lord said
[2:26:07] whoever you say it'll happen and he said
[2:26:10] before the surgeon pan touches her it'll
[2:26:13] be gone you know they had to help her up
[2:26:16] onto the surgical table because the
[2:26:19] growth was still in such a manifestation
[2:26:21] but even as he said before the surgeon's
[2:26:26] hand they're going into surgery they're
[2:26:28] ready to do surgery sister Mina is
[2:26:31] already out on the table she's knocked
[2:26:33] out asleep but it doesn't matter the
[2:26:37] condition of the individual on the table
[2:26:39] it matters the word that's been spoken
[2:26:41] by faith believing and that word could
[2:26:46] not come back and return void back to
[2:26:49] God himself because it came to a point
[2:26:51] where when the Prophet spoke the
[2:26:54] manifestation of a son of God fully
[2:26:56] adopted into the presence of God when he
[2:27:00] spoke goes as if the father spoken
[2:27:02] himself so now when he spoke it wasn't
[2:27:05] the words of William Branham but it was
[2:27:07] the words of God Himself going forth to
[2:27:10] the situation and now those God's own
[2:27:13] words and God's Word cannot return void
[2:27:16] to him has to happen
[2:27:17] it has to come to pass and that's the
[2:27:20] place that were called to as fruit
[2:27:22] bearing trees we're not called just to
[2:27:24] survive we're not just recalled to to
[2:27:26] live in grace we're not just called to
[2:27:29] manifest a little bit but were called to
[2:27:32] something even higher we're called to
[2:27:34] manifest the word so that when you speak
[2:27:37] it's gone Himself speaking to the
[2:27:41] situation and God Himself speaking to
[2:27:44] him that's why he has to do so much
[2:27:45] character building that's why he has to
[2:27:47] do so much trimming because you got to
[2:27:49] get that human side that flesh side so
[2:27:52] removed that you are so one with the
[2:27:55] mind of Christ in you that when you are
[2:27:59] thinking you have the very mind of
[2:28:01] Christ and you were thinking the same
[2:28:03] things that Christ Himself would think
[2:28:05] that's what the mind of Christ is about
[2:28:07] it's not about just being able to think
[2:28:11] nice thoughts but it's that the very
[2:28:14] thought you would think would be the
[2:28:16] same as the father so that the words you
[2:28:18] would express to the word is the thought
[2:28:20] Express she has to be able to think that
[2:28:23] word before can express itself and
[2:28:25] wanted to express it can't
[2:28:28] it's already gone forward life has been
[2:28:30] spoken but he has coming to that place
[2:28:34] of character to come to a place of
[2:28:36] adoption so that the father can so trust
[2:28:40] you with that word he wants to build you
[2:28:44] and build you to the point where he says
[2:28:45] I know if I give them the power they
[2:28:47] won't abuse it they'll use the power the
[2:28:50] same way I would let's just take us to
[2:28:57] the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we
[2:29:00] commonly thought gone all over the place
[2:29:03] and the message has been so cut off and
[2:29:05] the Lord I been bounced all over my
[2:29:09] notes and what I thought should be said
[2:29:18] but lord may you take something father
[2:29:23] whatever it might have been Lord make
[2:29:26] someone take a hold even if it's not a
[2:29:30] word spoken here tonight but may it just
[2:29:32] drive them drive them to the foot of the
[2:29:35] cross
[2:29:36] drive them Lord to more of you Father
[2:29:39] Lord drives them to say Lord why are my
[2:29:43] Lackey drive them to say why am I not
[2:29:45] producing the fruit write them to say
[2:29:49] Lord why why if this is a promise why
[2:29:52] don't I see it in my life
[2:29:53] Dryden say Lord I can see that you're
[2:29:57] moving but Lord where's that
[2:29:59] manifestation even as Gideon father
[2:30:02] there he said if if we are God's chosen
[2:30:09] people then where are all the mighty
[2:30:10] miracles so here we stand tonight and
[2:30:14] the world is engrossed encamped against
[2:30:17] us Satan is encamped against us the
[2:30:20] demons have been released from the river
[2:30:22] Euphrates and they're out of attacking
[2:30:24] the people following see complete
[2:30:26] insanity I was moving amongst the people
[2:30:29] this world father but Lord we know that
[2:30:31] that was a sign to us as the believers
[2:30:34] that when we see sin and the devil
[2:30:38] moving so rapidly are there amongst the
[2:30:41] people father that we could look into
[2:30:43] the bride look into what you were doing
[2:30:45] in your church and see you moving father
[2:30:47] or if the evil is so great then the
[2:30:52] Spirit of God is so much greater father
[2:30:54] so we just dedicate this to your father
[2:30:57] asking that you would have your way or
[2:31:00] do we just surrender at all as you go to
[2:31:02] people bless them for their
[2:31:03] attentiveness Lord or just for staying
[2:31:07] here and being willing to listen father
