amen and sister geraldine called uh came below into the hospital last night and they had she had a baby today so we want to thank the lord for that amen so i guess we might soon start having a house full of baby dedication praise the lord amen and so tonight i want to speak just before we break the bread tonight and go to the lost table i want to speak on a little thought i call the woman jail amen the woman jail well before i talk about that wonderful character and gillian woman i want us to just look at a scripture in the book of isaiah let's look together in the book of isaiah chapter 22. let's look together in the book of isaiah chapter 22. isaiah chapter 22 all praise the lord it's so wonderful to serve the lord amen it's a good thing to say of the lord praise the lord amen let's look at a little prophecy here that is that that uh uh it might come a little bit strange to many of us but it's the word of the lord and we pray that the lord will be able to to bless us tonight as we look at this together isaiah chapter 22 let's read from verse 22 praise the lord you know no wonder god sent us a prophet and i believe it was in god's design that brother branham would be you know uneducated so god will be able to channel through that life and gift for us to be able to enjoy uh the types and shadow because that was the best way that brother branham could express himself through the scripture was typed in shadow and paul learned that when he wrote the book of hebrew you know uh uh uh you know like brandon said he says uh you know god when god dared with paul three and a half years he spent on the backside of the of arabia and what he was doing is that he was looking in the old testament that he had steady under gamilia that boy was cool you know paul was very privileged you know he he had a father that took a roman citizenship so he had good form of education paul was educated and so he was really schooled very school very very smart and but god had to grab him in their smartness and then when when the lord met him on the road uh of of damascus you know the lord said to him it's hard for you to kick against the praise now keep that word in your mind because i'm going to use that tonight so but paul when he found himself at the back side of the desert he he went back and started reading from genesis he started reading from the beginning of creation because it was so striking the thing that blew his mind is for the pillar of fire to take a personal identification and say i'm jesus that thing blew paul's mind that thing took him from on his heart that he was writing praise the lord i mean it blew his mind so he had to go back and start reading from genesis all true and i believe as he was reading from genesis he saw the tree of life he shouted oh jesus he saw the the the cherubin he shouted jesus he saw the the abyss sacrifice he said oh that's jesus he saw the abraham sacrificing i mean jesus was just popping out of the bible everywhere for paul and that's what happened when god opened your understanding i mean he pops up every word the most strange scripture in the bible jesus will just pop up because the prophet of god says if you read and you don't find jesus go back and read again because jesus is here right in the scripture praise the lord even in noah's ark he could see jesus jesus was popping all over the bible that's what happened when you fall in love with the bible you read the word of god jesus flies from everywhere the most strange scripture in the bible he's going to tell you i'm right here he's head in simplicity praise the lord and he's revealed in the scene verse 22 let's read him and the kid of the house of david the key of the house of devin you think about that because this particular scripture will show itself up in the book of revelation into the church ages and that was one of the identification of jesus christ to the church ages praise the lord and the key of the house of david will are laid upon his shoulder and he shall open and none shall short and he shall shut and none shall open is that familiar to you that's jesus praise the lord verse 23 and i will fast in him as a male the same one that is the king of david is now a nail amen and our fasting him as a nail in a short place praise the lord in a short place a short place is also a chosen place amen our fasting him as a nail in the show place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house praise the lord i will fast to him as a nail and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house no water we started putting nail at the back of our door for us to hand our clothes because we are all hanging on him praise the lord amen that's why they were using before all the designer came with these nice hangers that they are nailing at the back of the door hanging at the back of the door it was nails that he used to use glory be to god amen and then shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house is hanged on him all the glory of his father's house is hank on him jesus said after we have done everything that we know how to do we say we are unprofitable because all the glory is hanged on him praise the lord the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantities from the vessel of cup even to all the vessel of flagon now you understand why paul in the book of hebrew he says that he saw why all the instrument in the temple was sanctified with blood he said everything that was used in the in the in the in the temple they had to sprinkle blood of the testimony when the blood was missed with the house of the high priest came and he spring it on the drums because they need to be sanctified he springer on the piano on on the violin make sure that everything is covered by blood he sprinkled on the word and then he spring it on the people because all the vessel verse 25 in that day said the lord of hosts shall the mail that is fasting in the show place be removed and cut down and fall and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for the lord have spoken it all our sin was nailed to the cross all our sickness burden was hanged on him and it shall be cut off after he has made transgression for the people this was a prophecy of jesus christ in his death amen are we together tonight praise the lord let's study this a little bit then we will get into what we want to talk about here i will not bold you amen praise the lord love the lord tonight amen now as you look at this you will realize that you realize that it comes it comes wonderful because when god plays something in his word he place it there in a unique way when it's taking an identification because pretty soon you will realize that that's the way that god's designed it let's look in the book of ezra ezra chapter 9. brother branham read this scripture when he preached the message the blushing prophet verse 6 and say oh my god i'm ashamed and i blush to to lift up my face today oh my god for our iniquity our increase over our head and our trespasses i've grown up unto the heavens since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass onto on to this day and for our iniquity and for our iniquity have we our kings our priests being delivered into the hands of the kings of the land to the sword to to captivity to the spoils and to to come to confusion of faith as it is this day and now for a little space of grace have dare shown from the lord our god to leave us a woman to escape and to give us a meal in his holy place and to give us a nail was this just a nail that the capital would come and nail no it was the same nail the isaiah prophesied about and to give us a nail in the holy place and what makes it unique is that when you look through the scripture every time the male year was representing a person which is jesus christ there was no s added to it every time in the scripture praise the lord and now for a little space of grace have been shown from the lord our god to leave us a raymond to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bunnies praise the lord even though we're going through this this uh uh cove igniting uh pandemic and water there but god is able to give us reviving praise the lord amen covey 19 can give us church or distance put max on our face but it should not take our revival away praise the lord it should not take our revival because our revival is in the word there's a nail in the holy place there's a nail in the show place that we can hang our burden we can hang our weaknesses praise the lord we can hang our sicknesses you can even hang yourself on it it's in a short place it's in a short position you don't you don't have a weight that that the nail cannot take are we together let's look in zacharias zechariah's chapter 10. zechariah's chapter 10 verse 3 my anger is counted against the shepherd and and i punish the gods for the lord of hosts have visited the floor of the house of judah and have made them as his garlic hers in battle out of him king fought the conan out of him the nail out of him the battle board out of him every oppressor together amen now so we see this and we can look at this all through the scripture you know it was it was it was kind of a beautiful you know when and now and brother branham said this i read this to you tonight out of the message remember him remembering the lord amen he says we remember the blessing that you have been to us and we remember your word that you who never leave us no forsake us old age we have nothing to do with it you will still remember us when the word shall be no more and time shall fill into eternity it is written something like this who a mother forget her suckling baby i will never forget you i have engraved upon my palms i have engraved upon the palm of my hands the nails that engrave our names we know that you remember us amen so just like we come to remember the lord in communion tonight he also remember us when he looks at his hands brother branham said he sits at the throne of god as a memorial with a neil's cast hands he has to be there to make intercession for us praise the lord amen the neo-scout body sits there as a memorial he said just like how joseph's body was kept as a memorial and every time the jews would come and see joseph body they know that one day they will be out of here praise the lord amen and that's the same way god keeps the body of jesus as a memorial praise the lord amen now so we uh uh we want to talk tonight about this woman jail amen let's go back in the book of of of judges i have 10 15 minutes to do this let me see if i can do it oh god bring back those days bring back those days lord praise the lord amen bring back those days when we where we just preach out of inspiration we don't have to preach to convince the people amen we're gonna have to preach to look at their faces what are they in agreement with us or not you just preach because the holy spirit laid on your heart you just preach and express yourself amen glory be to god bring back those days amen glory be to god blessed above women shall jail be she was a gentile amen blessed above women this woman jill oh praise the lord amen the story take us back to chapter four and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord and there god raised up a prophetess deborah and deborah as a prophetess she could prophesy and she called barak and prophesy because uh uh caesarea the king the captain of of the king hazard from canada has come against israel so she called barrack and she told him have the lord that anointed thee for this you know and he says go in the name of the law barra said no until you go with me praise the lord he she said go for the matter of fact the lord is going to deliver us but this time is going to be by the hand of a woman praise the lord now you have to realize that george's it's a span of time in israel where there was no prophet joshua the prophet after moses or the leader after moses has has gone has left the people and it was a space of time where the prophet was not on the scene so jerry said that god was working through the body the stage of george's it is it is it is to give the new testament church an idea that god's desire is to work through the people that when god used moses as a prophet or god set up a priesthood with aaron and all the priests the people to do sacrifice the people to do other works it does not means that god will not work with those people god work with all his people praise the lord amen one thing that god hates is hierarchy go ahead every any form of hierarchy where you stop the power of god only in a certain group of people god don't work like that praise the lord the ministry has is placed the officer's heart there are places in the church but there is no form of hierarchy in the church of the living god we only have an order and we must respect that other but there is no form of hierarchy god can use anyone he can you his desire is to use every one of us if we can make ourselves available if we can stop being afraid if we can just put our heart and say lord if you can use anyone you can use me praise the lord amen that's the reason why we don't have no special cheer here for no pastor no bishop praise the lord if it's your time to speak you stand here when you are don't go and sit down listen to the next person praise the lord oh you know i don't i don't condem you know other people that have cheers you know and those other diminishers lining up coming on the pulpit they feel so special they are on a high puppy they can look in the congregation and sometimes it's a shame when you see them sleeping up there praise the lord let's get to business you and you see all through the book of george's how god used shame guy he was just a common farmer a common farmer he was not a military man he was not a priest he was not a prophet he was just a common a common hearseman and god used him because he felt inspired something came over him and he said no this have to end every time you make his farm and keep his harvest the philistines will come and take everything he had to take a stand god is looking for a man or a woman that we have the courage to stand and says enough is enough praise the lord he said enough is enough and god bless his little courage he hi praise the lord amen and the bible talks about this other man it all he was he was a left-handed man praise the lord and god used him so all through the scripture in the old testament shadow god designed a book of judges at a time where everybody was doing a calling to their heart there was no prophet in the land everybody was doing but yet in the midst of all of that confusion god was still raising the people and that is the reason why why god also anointed a a prophetess gift it was not to make deborah a preacher no but god was trying to show on a shadow that he can use his people with different gifts that's the reason why it was now only the uh hashem god it was not only a jeff tied it was now on a gideon but here we have a woman also we have a woman also because that's how god balanced his body that's how he balance his body is the expression of his full image male and female because in the last age in the final fight it would be a bright body that would stand against the devil praise the lord it will be christ in bright form christ standing in the midst of the church with his gather around his pipes praise the lord he took it from his shoulder as a priest and put it around his pipe now so we see here we have a barrack we have a deborah and this captain terrified israel and the scripture says as he as he went along you know terrifying the people barrack went and he gathered men he gathered a bunch of you know army and charities and everything to go and fight to deliver israel but the border has already given him a word praise the lord she has already given him a word that god will deliver israel by the hand of a woman praise the lord amen can you think about that that should be enough to inspire your heart amen that we are the final voice to the final age glory be to god and you can read the rest of the story the bible says and [Music] this gentleman he went sincere he went you know escaping away from barrack and the rest of them he went down and he met this woman jill that's that's a beautiful thing this that's a beautiful beautiful uh design here he met her and she welcomed him into her house she welcomed him she never threw him up and said so what are you doing here that i mean you are the one that is troubling the land i'm going to no she will come in praise the lord he asked for water she gave him milk praise the lord and you know what milk does he relax you it's cool to get a glass of milk for you to sleep well try praise the lord he asked for water and she gave him milk and even brought a loaf a nice big bread give him some comfort praise praise the lord you know peter said in the book of uh in this episode he says why the thing or speak evil of you he said you be nice to them he said because in that way you will burn a cord of fire right upon their head and that's what jill was doing she was beginning to roast his head she failed him give him a go a glass of milk and the scripture says amen and the scripture says that he even said to her if anyone come to pursue me and everyone asks for me you tell them you have not seen me you can read the entire chapter four i'm sure you're going to read it tonight amen and uh he went to sleep he went and got one of his covers she gave him a nice place to sleep god honored his covers and started to rest praise the lord amen as soon as she heard him blowing the trumpet i mean it's starting to snow because he has eaten some love his stomach is fought drank some milk and he's just there groaning and groaning all in beige the bible says she took a nail she never took nails she took a nail praise the lord she took a nail right to his temple and the bible says she fasting him to the ground praise the lord he never had the time to ask who are you or what are you doing because her hand was to the nail and the right hand to the hammond the works man hammered praise the lord see thou weak of vessel all trembling or shaking but you know that somebody has to bring this thing to an end praise the lord somebody has to take this turret away she never even heard deborah prophesied about her she never heard about it she was not saying i'm going to do this because deborah said a woman is going to no no she never even heard about it right she just decided to take on some courage just take on some courage to face her fear i bet you she was afraid because she knows that this is the man that is that is a terror in the land this is the guy that is terrifying the people but she just took some courage church that's all we need it's just to gather some courage and say you are the lord that heal me from all my diseases just gather some courage to stand with god's word in this hour you are not the one that fighting the battle he's the one that fights in the battle he's the one that fights our battle all we need to do is to just gather courage to stand on his word praise the lord just to gather some courage praise the lord even though courage has been in some way like many words has been misunderstood you know uh so also courage has been misunderstood sometimes people think you know uh i i you need to get courage to tell him your mind and express yourself to him and most of the time it's not in the right way praise the lord we gain courage we do certain things and then we feel bad about it that's not enough courage we need courage to bring ourselves on a suggestion courage i believe if cecira will have sense of fear in her he would have known that he can't trust this woman but she was not afraid for him to feel comfortable to take a nap in her house she was showing no sense of fear praise the lord because she was looking for an opportunity to take a stand blessed are there above women that was what the borough sunk blessed are down above women and so you see that all through the scripture right here you know where god puts that prophecy in place and anoint that woman because just in this hour where there is bunch of confusion amen a bunch of confusion we must be grateful we have a prophet message that we should stay faithful talk because if we didn't know how the prophet message would be do we'll be in the same mess that the rest of them are in even with the prophet message we save trying to to to get ourselves right because there are just a lot of thoughts flying all over the place a lot of time no prophet no prophet and the book of samia is described no open vision everybody did what was right in their in in their own lives but yet in that time god was still dealing with people god was using ordinary people this was just an ordinary housewife she was not a daughter of a priest her husband was not a minister this was just an ordinary housewife that was willing to take a stand praise the lord and i believe that's the hour we are living in people amen some people want to tie themselves to a lineage i'm from this place my father is this my mama is this we are from this tribe we're from this country our connection go back to jeffersonville we you know brother branham dean my father we want to turn ourselves to a lineage just to show that we fit in but god was using ordinary people ordinary people jeff thai was he was despised he was he was cut out because he was born out of holy well luck but yet he pleased god to make him a deliverer we are in the hour where god is using ordinary people to bring a revival to their home revival to their home revival using ordinary people in the most simplest way to do something for the lord even if nobody noticed them they stay in their closet and they prayed and said god bring us a revival lord give the young people the holy ghost praise the lord we can dedicate ourselves this easter that god will use us in the simplest things that we can bring to him in the humblest way that we can be able to serve him praise the lord there are a lot of other things i could go into tonight but it's a convenient night musicians you can come let's buy our hairs jesus use me jesus use me and lord don't refuse me for sure lay there's a world that i can do [Music] is my way to crumble do all the cost be great i would do my best lord i will do my best jesus yeah jesus and lord don't refuse me surely there's a world [Music]

[Music] let's bring our heart to the lord tonight let's pray god is looking for people that will make themselves available not those that want to be in the spotlight but those that will make themselves available oh jesus oh father come lord and all the devil he's in the business of being an identity and he's robbing your people he's affecting them he's misrepresenting humbleness he's misrepresenting quietness when the joy of the lord is our strength father what he said david said i'd rather be a dominant in the house of the lord the most simply is saying if it's to be a prayer warrior if he's a singer special to the lord and whatever it is i can do fathers oh god the lord you will say it unto jail blessed be doubt above women hundreds of years before even the angel the angel gabriel will will borrow that prophecy to use it on marriage blessed are down above women because you have the courage you have the courage to do what is right you have the courage to stand for what is right whatever it is long oh hallelujah tonight thank you jesus thank you father please lord please oh god as we go into this week father gab towards the eastern father lord please lord jesus

we have to deny ourself and just stay there lord if we will have to miss our breakfast and just stay there lord if we will have to give up lunch for the lord and say lord i want to spend lunch with you i want to have lunch with you today we can find the quietest place in our house all the quietest place whatever they can be and just slip away [Music] and be able to put our house before the lord
