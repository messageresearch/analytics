[37:59] all the praises goes to the father amen
[38:03] let's take our bibles tonight and
[38:06] uh i can get away from the subject of
[38:11] rest that we've been talking about and
[38:14] because that's just what my body needs
[38:17] rest
[38:21] amen praise the lord brother i believe
[38:24] it was beautiful but just for a prayer
[38:26] service tonight and to kind of obey
[38:29] faith in our heart let's just read
[38:30] isaiah chapter
[38:32] 15 45 isaiah chapter 45
[38:36] and let's read from verse 9
[38:41] isaiah chapter 45 and we will take a
[38:43] verse
[38:44] in the book of psalms just uh
[38:47] to to be faith in our heart tonight
[38:52] and uh and then if the lord
[38:58] give us uh another time we will get back
[39:01] on our subject of rest
[39:04] glory be to god amen
[39:09] but it's it's amazing when the people of
[39:11] god pray
[39:12] and then the lord choose to come and
[39:15] have his way
[39:16] it is such a blessing isaiah chapter
[39:20] isaiah chapter 45 is that what i said
[39:28] okay i see why my reading yet is
[39:32] different because i'm not in assay
[39:39] as i 45
[39:44] let's read from verse
[39:45] [Music]
[39:47] 9. now what what i want to remind you is
[39:50] that keeping as i have 45
[39:54] honor context god is talking about
[39:57] a gentile king cyrus
[40:00] so you have to keep them in at the back
[40:03] of your mind
[40:04] that's that's the context where he
[40:06] approaching
[40:08] what he's going to say verse 9
[40:12] woe unto him that strife with his maker
[40:18] let the porsche strive way far
[40:22] with the porsche of the earth shall the
[40:25] clay say unto him that faction it
[40:28] what maketh thou
[40:31] all that works he have no hands
[40:36] woe unto him that said unto his father
[40:41] what be what begeth doubt or told
[40:44] the woman what have thou brought forth
[40:49] thou said the lord the holy one of
[40:52] israel
[40:54] and his maker asked me
[40:58] of things to come concerning
[41:02] my sons and concerning
[41:06] the works of my hand command
[41:10] yea me
[41:14] i want you to remember that because i
[41:17] will do it on that a little bit
[41:20] commend yeah amen is god asking us to
[41:23] command him
[41:26] is that not humbling
[41:30] praise the lord that particular verse
[41:33] has been
[41:34] misunderstood in the pentecostal in the
[41:36] character
[41:37] world and uh but let's read on a little
[41:41] bit here verse 12
[41:43] verse 11 again for thou said the law the
[41:46] holy one
[41:47] of israel the maker the holy one of
[41:50] israel and his maker
[41:52] asked me of things to come concerning my
[41:56] sons
[41:58] and concerning the works of my hands
[42:01] command ye me
[42:04] i have made the earth and created man
[42:08] upon it

[42:13] have stretched out the heavens
[42:16] and all their hosts
[42:19] have commended praise the lord the lord
[42:23] bless you you may have your seed
[42:25] and
[42:29] psalm chapter 65 i'm i'm coming back to
[42:32] that verse again
[42:36] psalm chapter 65 let's read psalm
[42:38] chapter 65
[42:40] uh i'm coming back to that verse again
[42:43] we read one
[42:44] verse in psalm chapter 65
[42:53] praise the lord
[42:58] we'll read one verse in psalm chapter 65
[43:05] and that will be verse 4.
[43:11] that will be verse 4 blessed is the man
[43:14] whom
[43:15] thou chose it and caused to approach
[43:19] unto day
[43:21] that he may endure in that cult
[43:25] we shall be satisfied
[43:28] with the goodness of the house
[43:33] even of thy holy temple
[43:37] praise the lord i believe that the lord
[43:39] has caused us
[43:41] he has chosen us and he has caused
[43:44] us to approach unto him
[43:48] praise the lord amen
[43:51] listen to what brother branham said when
[43:53] he read that that
[43:55] particular scripture the psalm chapter
[43:58] 65 he said
[44:02] notice
[44:06] he said notice
[44:15] come in
[44:22] the approach of god
[44:25] god has a way
[44:29] of approach you know
[44:33] if you are going to visit a king
[44:38] there's a way you approach a king
[44:44] there's a way to approach well
[44:52] make it more simpler than that
[44:56] the boy did want to approach a young
[45:00] lady
[45:01] to get acquainted with her there's a
[45:05] setting approach
[45:08] you just can't come up there and say hi
[45:11] there
[45:12] like to meet you shake your hands
[45:16] and she isn't very much a lady
[45:20] she will let you know
[45:23] where to get on and off at
[45:30] there's a certain way you want to
[45:33] approach it
[45:36] you want to come up with respect
[45:39] to the lady and so far
[45:43] and there's a way to
[45:46] approach all things
[45:49] praise the lord there's a way
[45:52] to approach all things i want us to
[45:55] underline that
[45:59] and there's a way to approach
[46:02] god
[46:07] praise the lord
[46:10] there's a way to approach all things
[46:14] and there's a way to approach god
[46:20] and if we don't know the approach to god
[46:24] we will never be able to
[46:27] get an audience
[46:30] with god
[46:36] praise the lord if we don't know
[46:41] the approach to god we will never be
[46:44] able
[46:45] to get an audience
[46:49] with god
[46:55] he said in a court you just don't walk
[46:58] up and the judge is on the stand
[47:03] and say hey josh
[47:06] i want to talk to you a little bit
[47:09] will throw you out of the courtroom lock
[47:12] you up
[47:14] for this orderly
[47:18] conduct see
[47:21] there's a way you have to approach
[47:25] the judge
[47:30] praise the lord how much more
[47:35] our maker creator of heaven and earth
[47:40] there is a way to approach god
[47:44] but yet the psalmist said blessed is the
[47:47] man
[47:48] whom thou chose it
[47:52] and cause to approach thee
[47:59] praise the lord
[48:02] he calls us he has given us this
[48:05] privilege
[48:07] for us to approach him
[48:10] to even put his name on our tongue
[48:17] the most unruly part of our body
[48:23] the part that is difficult to team
[48:30] but he have caused us to approach
[48:34] him
[48:38] we get so used to the wednesday night
[48:40] and the sunday morning
[48:42] and the routine of church
[48:46] and sometimes it is just the service
[48:51] and let god never be out of the picture
[48:55] there is one purpose why we are here
[48:58] is because of him
[49:04] we counted the privilege that he have
[49:07] caused
[49:08] us to approach him
[49:13] that he made word in that cult
[49:17] the simon said we shall be satisfied
[49:22] with the goodness of the house
[49:26] amen we shall be
[49:29] satisfied with the goodness
[49:35] oh david said i was glad when he said
[49:37] unto me
[49:39] let's go to the house of the lord
[49:42] praise the lord do you feed that way
[49:45] when it's time to come to church
[49:47] you just you feel glad that i'm going in
[49:50] the house of the lord because i know i
[49:52] will be blessed i know god is going to
[49:54] speak to me
[50:02] oh are you thinking i don't know if i
[50:04] want to i want to be there tonight
[50:06] i'm a little bit tired and uh
[50:15] but you have to know that blessed is the
[50:18] man
[50:20] praise the lord in most cases that word
[50:23] man
[50:24] stands for human right
[50:27] okay so blessed is
[50:31] the person that god has given such a
[50:34] privilege
[50:35] to be able to approach him
[50:39] we must count in the blessing
[50:43] praise the lord
[50:46] we must count in the blessing because
[50:48] that's where the blessing starts from
[50:51] you're very taught right what is in your
[50:54] mind
[50:55] coming to the house of the lord that's
[50:57] where the blessing starts from
[50:59] it does the blessing does that comes
[51:02] from
[51:03] the the wonderful dynamic preaching of
[51:05] the word it's just your mind your
[51:06] attitude
[51:08] your approach
[51:13] to the lord
[51:16] now even if the preacher is the most
[51:18] hypocrite
[51:21] god is going to so honor your approach
[51:27] amen
[51:30] that even if he got so crutch in his
[51:34] mind and he says i'm just waiting for
[51:35] that brother let me see him coming
[51:37] through the door
[51:38] i'm going to ring him down but with that
[51:43] sacred attitude in your mind
[51:47] oh almighty god i can't wait to get to
[51:49] the house of the lord
[51:50] thank you jesus praise the lord you come
[51:53] prayed up and
[51:54] your mind is just on god
[51:58] amen that's what he did to billam
[52:02] billam tried his hardest right but
[52:04] everything he comes
[52:06] that came from out of his mouth there
[52:07] shall be a star that will rise up to
[52:09] jacob
[52:14] and he prophesied and he blessed the
[52:17] people of god
[52:20] until the man i hired him was frustrated
[52:22] what is this guy doing
[52:25] that's not what i brought here for bro
[52:31] i brought you here so you can really get
[52:33] on that brother
[52:34] right now
[52:39] brother branham's is the right attitude
[52:43] the right attitude
[52:46] praise the lord
[52:55] amen he says there's an
[52:58] approach to everything
[53:02] and we want to look at tonight
[53:06] an approach to faith

[53:32] god's purpose
[53:36] of creation was to find a place of rest
[53:42] rest was one of the primary thing
[53:46] in god's mind even being the great
[53:49] intent of spirit
[53:51] because he had you and myself as
[53:54] his attributes in him he was not
[53:57] addressed
[54:01] he was not arrest just having us in him
[54:06] we were holding him we were i mean we
[54:09] were
[54:10] sinless in him but yet he did not have
[54:12] rest
[54:17] that's the purpose of the gospel is to
[54:20] bring you rest
[54:21] the purpose of the ministry is to bring
[54:23] you to a place of rest
[54:26] that's the reason why the holy ghost is
[54:28] a type of rest
[54:35] praise the lord there's
[54:38] a rest on to the people of god
[54:44] he never just caught us to give us laws
[54:47] and rules where we can just be
[54:49] working like recruits jumping and just
[54:51] you know in the morning ellie joke in
[54:53] the afternoon electro we're just working
[54:55] our way
[54:56] working our way and working our way no
[54:59] he want to bring us to a place
[55:03] of rest yes
[55:12] and just to know that
[55:15] it's comforting
[55:18] just to know that it's comforting
[55:22] i got to prepare a place for you while
[55:24] he's here there
[55:25] the place of rest
[55:37] it's almost like uh uh uh planning for
[55:40] the vacation we
[55:41] uh i mean we are going to florida we are
[55:44] going to
[55:45] uh uh panama whatever it is you plan a
[55:47] vacation this is
[55:48] you know the date the expectation that
[55:52] creates
[55:52] in you you can't wait to get in because
[55:55] you know
[55:56] after you have left your environment and
[55:59] left everything behind you
[56:01] you know all you're going to do is just
[56:03] just rest
[56:05] right everything that you will be doing
[56:09] whether you go hiking whether you go
[56:11] swimming
[56:12] it will become rest to you because it's
[56:15] out
[56:16] of the normal you will enjoy it
[56:20] even though you now be sleeping from
[56:21] morning to night
[56:24] you'll be out looking at the street or
[56:26] in the morning shopping whatever you'll
[56:28] be doing
[56:28] it will be so relaxing to you
[56:36] that's what heaven is going to be like
[56:40] it's a place of rest amen
[56:45] never forget that god want to bring you
[56:47] to rest
[56:49] amen praise the lord
[56:52] just like how he sees from his work he
[56:55] also wants you to cease from your work
[56:58] and coming to rest
[57:03] so we will we want to look at something
[57:05] here
[57:07] the last time i was talking on
[57:10] the law of nature uh
[57:14] you know i use this uh
[57:17] you know where where brother branham
[57:19] says here
[57:20] he says there's a law to everything
[57:24] and and we use that there is a law
[57:26] giving
[57:27] among everything that's the way he says
[57:29] it there is a law giving
[57:31] among everything but tonight i i just
[57:34] want to
[57:35] go right back to that same context uh
[57:38] that scene as cold there and
[57:41] from restoration of the bride trade and
[57:43] i want to talk
[57:44] a little bit on enforcing the claim
[57:50] enforcing a claim
[57:54] and that's the reason why we read from
[57:55] the book of isaiah chapter 45
[57:58] let's go back there again like i said
[58:00] the context of the of the chapter
[58:02] is god talking about uh
[58:05] a gentile king that
[58:09] before he was born
[58:12] before he was born god is prophesying
[58:15] about him
[58:16] he's giving a word over to his prophet
[58:19] isaiah to talk
[58:21] about cyrus verse 1
[58:25] isaiah 45
[58:28] thus said the lord to his anointed to
[58:31] sorrow
[58:32] whose right hand have i withholding
[58:37] to subdue nations and god is prophesying
[58:40] you know this
[58:40] this would just give us a clear picture
[58:43] word
[58:44] you know uh uh you know god ordained
[58:48] leaders
[58:50] and god is is is giving a word about
[58:53] this man even before he was born
[58:56] right praise the lord and how he will
[58:59] subdue nation
[59:00] and all of that and then in the
[59:02] conversation
[59:04] it's almost like
[59:08] he made us he knows how our thoughts run
[59:11] and he know how people would think about
[59:13] this how can how can
[59:15] isaiah come and be prophesying about a
[59:18] gentile
[59:19] uh you know king and you know in in
[59:22] water view
[59:24] and then so he tried to address it
[59:26] address the conversation there it just
[59:28] looked like
[59:30] like uh you know uh a man writing a
[59:33] story he says uh
[59:35] uh concerning this man that i've
[59:38] prophesied about
[59:40] i mean i'm the maker it's just like the
[59:43] the click and i said to the portal
[59:45] why you choose to do this and why you
[59:47] choose to do that
[59:49] praise the lord and he goes
[59:53] on and he says and and and wrote on to
[59:55] him that said to his father why
[59:57] be gathered this and why they know to
[59:59] the woman why you brought for that and
[1:00:01] he gets back down here to where we want
[1:00:03] to look at a little bit
[1:00:05] thus said the lord god that's verse 11
[1:00:07] the holy one of israel
[1:00:09] and his maker acts
[1:00:13] me of things
[1:00:18] to come concerning my sons
[1:00:22] and concerning the works of my hands
[1:00:26] command yea me like i said this
[1:00:30] this uh uh uh verse is a very big verse
[1:00:34] in uh in uh penny costar
[1:00:38] and uh the karamazov movement all of
[1:00:40] these
[1:00:41] prosperity gospel preachers they like to
[1:00:43] use that because they can use that to
[1:00:45] ginger the people
[1:00:46] and say you see you can command god and
[1:00:48] you know god is saying you should
[1:00:50] command him you should say thanks to him
[1:00:52] praise the lord
[1:00:56] he says i have made the earth
[1:01:00] and create a man upon it you just wash
[1:01:03] it you know
[1:01:04] as i had a beautiful style of writing
[1:01:06] you just watched
[1:01:08] god have just said you know he says ask
[1:01:11] anything concerning the sons of men in
[1:01:13] the works of my hands
[1:01:16] command yemen
[1:01:19] amen he says i have made
[1:01:22] the earth and create a man upon it i
[1:01:25] even my hands
[1:01:29] have stretched out the heavens and all
[1:01:32] the horse
[1:01:33] have commanded
[1:01:42] praise the lord
[1:01:48] now in one sense you can think about it
[1:01:50] this way
[1:01:52] who they command him before he created
[1:01:54] everything
[1:01:56] and if nobody commanded him nobody can
[1:01:59] command him now
[1:02:06] praise the lord if nobody commanded him
[1:02:09] nobody can give him a command now
[1:02:13] but you see that it's a way that the
[1:02:16] uh uh uh you know uh
[1:02:20] the word is rating in and and and if you
[1:02:22] go back and look at it
[1:02:24] you will realize i was just looking at
[1:02:26] that uh uh studying that a little bit
[1:02:28] this evening when i got here
[1:02:30] you realize that uh in a way that god
[1:02:34] said this
[1:02:38] it's not in the sense of you
[1:02:41] commanding him is in the sense of you
[1:02:44] uh accepting what he has done accepting
[1:02:48] what he has commanded
[1:02:50] is more in the sense of you trusting him
[1:02:53] for what he has said
[1:02:56] amen if i have ordained cyrus to be
[1:03:00] my seventh if i call him man anointed
[1:03:03] you better trust what i'm doing
[1:03:09] praise the lord
[1:03:16] so we want to look at that
[1:03:21] and approach this thought of enforcing
[1:03:24] the claim that brother branham
[1:03:26] expressed here in in restoration of the
[1:03:28] bride
[1:03:29] and i think it's a beautiful way because
[1:03:31] many times
[1:03:33] we we we express faith i i i
[1:03:36] fear i mean faith and and and there is a
[1:03:40] sometimes there's a substance of fear
[1:03:44] believing god and hoping that it does
[1:03:46] not fail
[1:03:51] we are expressing faith and saying lord
[1:03:55] i believe you
[1:03:56] but yeah you are scared oh my goodness i
[1:03:57] don't really know
[1:03:59] lord i believe you i believe you you can
[1:04:01] do it
[1:04:02] then you come out again say lord i
[1:04:03] believe you you can do it one should be
[1:04:05] enough
[1:04:10] praise the lord if you believe god you
[1:04:12] must be a lord i believe you
[1:04:14] praise the lord amen it's almost like
[1:04:17] brother brahma says planting the seed
[1:04:19] and going back and digging it up again
[1:04:21] have half a dramatized and then you
[1:04:23] cover it up again and you go back
[1:04:25] and you come and dig it up again
[1:04:28] i'm believing god lord jesus i'm i'm
[1:04:31] believing you i know you can do it
[1:04:33] lord jesus i be i believe nothing is
[1:04:36] impossible with god
[1:04:37] nothing fear
[1:04:41] is honor that
[1:04:44] fear is on the dead it's almost
[1:04:48] lord i believe you do it now before it
[1:04:50] before it failed
[1:04:52] yeah an element
[1:04:56] of fear when god says command me
[1:05:01] he's saying trust me
[1:05:07] trust me
[1:05:10] know that my thoughts are right
[1:05:15] whatever i have ordained whatever i have
[1:05:17] spoken
[1:05:18] you see that's the reason why brother
[1:05:21] branham said fit must have a resting
[1:05:23] place
[1:05:25] and the resting place of faith is not
[1:05:28] what you think it's not how you feel
[1:05:33] it's not a symptom it's not a situation
[1:05:36] faith resting place
[1:05:37] is the blessed word of god
[1:05:43] praise the lord faith must have a
[1:05:46] resting place
[1:05:48] that's what he says
[1:05:51] amen lord be to god
[1:06:00] we ain't age like i said people we
[1:06:02] express faith
[1:06:04] and we almost like a child going through
[1:06:06] the graveyard whistling
[1:06:09] sure to assure himself that he's not
[1:06:12] afraid when he's afraid
[1:06:20] we are so afraid
[1:06:25] praise the lord now let's
[1:06:28] follow this now brother branham dealing
[1:06:31] with this
[1:06:32] as he approached the subject he took the
[1:06:34] thought from the message that brother
[1:06:36] neville preached
[1:06:38] but nivea was preaching the message and
[1:06:40] bernie expressed
[1:06:42] the thought of
[1:06:46] restore he used the word restore
[1:06:50] and then he was also using the the
[1:06:53] expression of
[1:06:54] enforcing the claim and brother brahm
[1:06:56] says adjust some notes down
[1:06:58] and i went home and started studying it
[1:07:00] i realized it was a beautiful thought
[1:07:02] and then as he started stealing on on
[1:07:05] this message or
[1:07:06] starting on the thought of restoration
[1:07:08] uh
[1:07:09] enforcing the claim he uh
[1:07:15] took an example and in in
[1:07:18] in he kind of started splitting it to us
[1:07:20] now he
[1:07:21] he brought it this way and he says it's
[1:07:24] just
[1:07:24] like when brother evans lost his car
[1:07:29] i brought a car was stolen but evans
[1:07:31] used to be the one that repaired brother
[1:07:32] branham's car
[1:07:35] so i mean there was there was uh there
[1:07:38] was uh
[1:07:40] uh you know a big uh uh
[1:07:43] stealing cars you know people were
[1:07:45] jumping into people kyle it was
[1:07:46] it was it was big at the time in indiana
[1:07:49] you know and
[1:07:50] and uh brother evans left his car and
[1:07:53] and
[1:07:53] he and his family they were driving you
[1:07:55] know uh you know pretty much like
[1:07:58] two hours or more coming over to
[1:08:01] to uh you know jeffersonville for the
[1:08:04] meetings and all of that
[1:08:05] and and stole the brothers car
[1:08:08] so brother branham talking this story
[1:08:11] you know relating here he's he's kind of
[1:08:13] for relating
[1:08:15] enforcing the claim because the car has
[1:08:17] lost
[1:08:18] you know or the car was stolen now so
[1:08:20] he's kind of kind of
[1:08:22] to help us to see how the brother
[1:08:26] car was restored back to him
[1:08:29] amen and for the car to be restored back
[1:08:33] he had to enforce a claim
[1:08:37] it's almost like what we do with our
[1:08:39] insurance company
[1:08:40] sure are we together
[1:08:44] praise the lord so now he's bringing it
[1:08:46] here now in the line of faith
[1:08:48] so we can be able to grab it but then he
[1:08:50] get he goes right here to the scripture
[1:08:52] he says so then
[1:08:54] we had a scripture here yeah because
[1:08:58] as he talks about it he said when he was
[1:09:01] told that brother
[1:09:02] brother evans car was stolen what he did
[1:09:05] he sent for some brothers
[1:09:07] praise the lord and and i believe that
[1:09:10] these
[1:09:10] were brothers that loved the lord and
[1:09:13] also men
[1:09:14] men of faith you know uh uh people
[1:09:17] that were caught up into the word people
[1:09:19] that were ready to put their hearts
[1:09:21] before god
[1:09:22] and and uh he read it in this message he
[1:09:25] said it in another message
[1:09:26] and what he said is that uh when the
[1:09:29] brothers came together
[1:09:31] he said well brother evans has lost his
[1:09:33] car and we must go before the lord for
[1:09:35] us to pray
[1:09:36] that the lord will restore our brother's
[1:09:38] car he said but we have to find a
[1:09:40] scripture
[1:09:45] you are enforcing a claim based on a law
[1:09:53] it's not because someone hits your car
[1:09:57] definitely the insurance company must
[1:09:59] pay pay for your vehicle
[1:10:03] you have to go and find a law
[1:10:09] are we together because faith must have
[1:10:12] a resting place
[1:10:17] a faith is at rest
[1:10:20] you will not be nervous
[1:10:24] amen you will not be nervous assistant
[1:10:29] says lord i can call ten thousand angels
[1:10:31] right now
[1:10:32] lord i i just give it to you i believe
[1:10:34] you can do it
[1:10:36] that's what brother branham says there
[1:10:38] is an approach
[1:10:40] to god there is an approach
[1:10:44] to everything
[1:10:51] are we together
[1:10:54] we are in our world we are looking
[1:10:57] to the great translation faith
[1:11:01] praise the lord the great translation
[1:11:04] faith the changing of our body the
[1:11:06] changing of our attitude
[1:11:08] now uh uh a faith is not
[1:11:12] having its resting place upon the word
[1:11:15] of god
[1:11:16] and you are looking at the symptoms
[1:11:19] in your body if you are basing your
[1:11:22] faith on how much you feel
[1:11:25] all the things that are happening around
[1:11:27] your life
[1:11:28] for you to believe that god is going to
[1:11:31] change your body
[1:11:32] and you're going to get a rapture you
[1:11:34] are putting
[1:11:36] faith to the wrong place
[1:11:41] are we together
[1:11:47] oh glory to god tonight amen i see you
[1:11:51] right on the edge of your seat
[1:11:54] praise the lord now he says so
[1:11:57] when he gathered the brothers together
[1:11:59] he says and so then we had a scripture
[1:12:02] here
[1:12:02] that jesus said
[1:12:05] wherever two or more i gather in my name
[1:12:10] and if they will agree
[1:12:14] i will be in their midst and if they
[1:12:18] will
[1:12:19] agreed as touching any one thing
[1:12:23] any one second thing in the exit
[1:12:26] don't doubt they shall have
[1:12:31] what they ask they shall be given to
[1:12:34] them
[1:12:35] now brother branham called the brothers
[1:12:38] together
[1:12:40] and he read the scripture
[1:12:43] he printed him to the promise of god
[1:12:48] he find a promise god have said
[1:12:52] now what are you thinking in your mind
[1:12:54] now what are you making up
[1:12:56] what god has said
[1:13:00] because we have to realize there's a law
[1:13:04] of god in nature
[1:13:10] beautiful oh my goodness
[1:13:13] and everything in nature draw their
[1:13:18] inspiration from the law of god
[1:13:24] praise the lord even the airplane that
[1:13:27] fly
[1:13:31] their inspiration was drawn
[1:13:34] from the birds
[1:13:38] and the way that god built the birds
[1:13:46] you know i was as i i was i was standing
[1:13:49] there
[1:13:50] and i was listening to i mean uh
[1:13:53] something on animal life and and uh
[1:13:57] uh one of one of the birds was
[1:14:01] the the wool picker
[1:14:06] that bird is built in such a way
[1:14:12] that the brain
[1:14:16] because you know how the wool picker
[1:14:18] hits
[1:14:22] praise the lord is built in a way
[1:14:26] to be able to absorb the shock when it
[1:14:30] hitting the
[1:14:32] the the wood like that right
[1:14:36] and i mean it's just beautiful sure
[1:14:43] so there's a law
[1:14:47] in nature verb talks about it the fish
[1:14:51] never i mean it never worried about
[1:14:54] being drunk
[1:14:56] right
[1:14:59] and never worry that it's going to get
[1:15:01] drowned in the water because
[1:15:03] it trusts its maker
[1:15:07] it believes the way that it was made
[1:15:14] praise the lord so brother branham and i
[1:15:17] read this
[1:15:18] uh and and talks about finding this
[1:15:21] scripture
[1:15:22] and he read the scripture he says he
[1:15:24] says now
[1:15:27] there's the law now
[1:15:30] the one that have to enforce that
[1:15:34] lord is the holy spirit
[1:15:40] amen the one that has to enforce that
[1:15:43] lord
[1:15:44] is the holy spirit the promise you
[1:15:47] already find a promise
[1:15:48] lord you said in your word you know
[1:15:53] a father would not give his child
[1:15:57] acceptance when they ask for fish
[1:15:58] neither a stone when they ask for bread
[1:16:03] so you will not deny them the eyes for
[1:16:05] the holy ghost
[1:16:08] it's a promise in god's word is right
[1:16:11] before you
[1:16:14] why leave that promise and start working
[1:16:18] the holy ghost up
[1:16:23] what brother branham is saying is that
[1:16:24] you have found a promise you have
[1:16:26] identified a promise in god's word it's
[1:16:29] a law of god
[1:16:34] all you have to do lord i believe your
[1:16:36] word because you said it
[1:16:38] i believe that this is your word
[1:16:43] amen right praise the lord
[1:16:46] heaven and earth will pass away but i
[1:16:48] believe that this promise
[1:16:50] will not pass away
[1:16:54] he says then it is the holy spirit
[1:16:59] that goes to enforcing
[1:17:02] their lord
[1:17:07] praise the lord
[1:17:10] it's almost like seeing the teeth
[1:17:14] in your house and you call the law
[1:17:17] enforcement
[1:17:21] and the police say we are on our way he
[1:17:23] said okay i'm going to tie that guy down
[1:17:27] i'm going to arrest him and imprison him
[1:17:31] in my bathroom until you come
[1:17:38] praise the lord
[1:17:45] glory be to god and if you try to do
[1:17:48] that
[1:17:50] you might be the one the police might be
[1:17:56] carrying
[1:17:58] are you grabbing the concept that's the
[1:18:01] reason why
[1:18:04] saints of god children we have to
[1:18:07] believe this word of god
[1:18:11] we have to take god at his word
[1:18:17] not the circumstances around our life
[1:18:24] god that have spoken his word
[1:18:28] and have made a promise and have called
[1:18:30] you to believe
[1:18:32] and identify that promise he's more than
[1:18:36] evil to bring it to pass in your life
[1:18:43] we try to make ourselves the enforcing
[1:18:45] officer
[1:18:48] you are not the enforcing officer of
[1:18:51] god's lord
[1:18:55] and like i said on sunday that's the
[1:18:56] thing that is creating
[1:18:58] a lot of disappointment in in in
[1:19:01] increasing them because people think
[1:19:04] that they are the enforcing officer
[1:19:06] they're going to bring to pass
[1:19:08] whatever god says they try to force
[1:19:10] things by rules
[1:19:12] and false things by regulation you know
[1:19:14] and and when things are not working out
[1:19:16] because
[1:19:17] they have put their hands into into
[1:19:19] god's business
[1:19:20] and mess their own life up then it says
[1:19:23] that there is nothing to the holy ghost
[1:19:29] it's all because they have put their own
[1:19:31] interpretation work things out their own
[1:19:33] way
[1:19:33] interpret it come this way and bring it
[1:19:36] this way and then it says where i try
[1:19:37] everything this thing does not work
[1:19:40] right you try everything the only thing
[1:19:42] you did not try
[1:19:44] is to take your hands off of god's word
[1:19:46] just believe what god says
[1:19:48] and trust that god is able to bring it
[1:19:50] to pass that's the only thing you did
[1:19:52] not try
[1:19:53] you try all the churches around you but
[1:19:56] you did not
[1:19:57] try taking god at his word
[1:20:09] people are disappointed they are
[1:20:12] frustrated
[1:20:15] brother branham says we will speak
[1:20:17] things into existence
[1:20:19] brother branham says the bride revival
[1:20:23] verb says we will claim our loved ones
[1:20:27] but yeah he's the very one that is
[1:20:29] saying the holy ghost is the enforcing
[1:20:33] power
[1:20:35] to god's claim
[1:20:47] are we together
[1:20:55] it's not by might
[1:20:59] now by power he said well by my spirit
[1:21:08] praise the lord
[1:21:22] some time ago when i mean we were you
[1:21:26] know

[1:22:02] to buy the equipment disco light and
[1:22:05] everything because they're coming to

[1:22:14] minds now when we can get all of this
[1:22:16] equipment

[1:23:17] you know you want to have a nightclub
[1:23:20] you want to have a
[1:23:21] you know a recreation place
[1:23:25] in my work
[1:23:29] but not the house of the living god
[1:23:32] jesus says i will build my church
[1:23:35] and he is the word it takes the word of
[1:23:39] god
[1:23:42] the word is the foundation stone
[1:23:45] that very same word is going to be the
[1:23:48] headstone
[1:23:50] that's what it takes
[1:23:56] not the building not the equipment right
[1:23:59] right it has nothing to do with it right
[1:24:03] it has to be the word
[1:24:08] church if we don't if we don't strive to
[1:24:11] stay with this world
[1:24:13] if we don't pray that god keeps us with
[1:24:15] this word
[1:24:17] we are going to disburse like the wind
[1:24:23] when we leave the word and start chasing
[1:24:28] different things
[1:24:37] oh god
[1:24:41] help us lord to stay with your word
[1:24:47] glory be to god
[1:24:51] amen
[1:24:55] he says and there's the lord he's re
[1:24:58] he's now
[1:24:59] speaking about the scripture that he has
[1:25:01] read he says and there
[1:25:02] is the lord now the one
[1:25:06] that's here to enforce that lord
[1:25:09] is the holy spirit
[1:25:13] how about people who don't believe
[1:25:17] in the holy spirit
[1:25:21] you are rejecting your own
[1:25:24] peace and mercy
[1:25:31] you are rejecting your own peace and
[1:25:34] mercy
[1:25:35] because you are not allowing the law
[1:25:39] enforcement
[1:25:40] to enforce his law in your life
[1:25:44] you are not allowing the law enforcement
[1:25:47] to enforce this law in your home you are
[1:25:51] not allowing the law enforcement
[1:25:53] to enforce this law in your situation
[1:25:56] so you are rejecting your peace
[1:26:01] and mercy
[1:26:07] when you're supposed to be resting and
[1:26:10] let the law enforcement enforce the lord
[1:26:12] of god
[1:26:13] and bring to pass what god has said
[1:26:20] you are taking matters into your hands
[1:26:26] and you are so scared that you will fail
[1:26:31] and you say lord you know i believe you
[1:26:33] no you know i'm trusting you lord you
[1:26:35] know
[1:26:36] you know
[1:26:40] right okay if you trust me let go
[1:26:47] [Applause]
[1:26:48] you are trusting me let go
[1:27:07] you know sometimes you preach and you
[1:27:09] trust the lord
[1:27:11] to be able to inspire you
[1:27:14] but i will tell you the truth is
[1:27:17] sometimes
[1:27:18] is no measure to the way that god
[1:27:21] deals with a man on the subject
[1:27:26] there is no measure
[1:27:33] you are rejecting your own peace
[1:27:37] and mercy now he goes ahead and he says
[1:27:41] just reading this testimony to you
[1:27:43] he says now we got on
[1:27:46] our knees about
[1:27:49] five men but a soft man and many others
[1:27:52] there
[1:27:54] about four or five men after
[1:27:58] reading the law of god
[1:28:03] praise the lord amen
[1:28:10] he says and we got on our knees
[1:28:16] we knelt down and i plead this case
[1:28:21] before god
[1:28:26] and then i took the word
[1:28:29] the promise
[1:28:32] i talked the word
[1:28:40] many times we go to praying
[1:28:43] you have to keep the word on your mind
[1:28:47] don't be talking to god and be thinking
[1:28:49] about something thinking when i get up
[1:28:51] from here that's how i'm going to do
[1:28:52] that's exactly what i'm going to do
[1:28:55] and then you get up and you believe that
[1:28:57] god told you that
[1:29:01] you just got caught up in your emotion
[1:29:04] you were just
[1:29:05] speaking vain words and your mind you
[1:29:07] were kneeling down before god
[1:29:12] thinking about how you're going to solve
[1:29:14] your own problem
[1:29:17] you're on your knees finding your own
[1:29:19] solution
[1:29:22] right
[1:29:26] and that's the reason why we get so
[1:29:28] scared
[1:29:29] sure we can take it off our mind
[1:29:36] right
[1:29:38] get so scared
[1:29:42] now you know i'm trusting you you you
[1:29:44] know i'm trusting our goal is evil
[1:29:46] for god is evil he being able ever since
[1:29:50] people
[1:29:55] he's been unable god ever since
[1:30:06] faith
[1:30:09] in god brings you to a place of rest
[1:30:17] it brings you to a place of rest
[1:30:28] do you realize that most of the time
[1:30:32] when things will happen and god will
[1:30:34] answer your prayer
[1:30:36] even if it is right there right there
[1:30:38] and then
[1:30:39] there will always be a sudden moment
[1:30:41] where your mind goes off the problem
[1:30:47] oh oh thank you jesus
[1:31:02] you know it's just like brother branham
[1:31:04] said he says
[1:31:06] revival comes by flexibility
[1:31:11] he says that's how revival comes he said
[1:31:13] that's how child birth comes
[1:31:15] he said god never gave birth god never
[1:31:17] moved when the people are nervous
[1:31:23] when the people are scared to death he
[1:31:25] said god never moved
[1:31:32] i mean the preacher can preach the word
[1:31:34] and the word can be
[1:31:35] preaching and i mean he can be rebuking
[1:31:38] saying
[1:31:38] and he can be calling things out and
[1:31:41] they're oh my god you're just there
[1:31:43] and you are just right there and and
[1:31:45] then and yeah man and he's preaching and
[1:31:48] teaching
[1:31:48] whatever he's doing and god is just
[1:31:51] dealing with you you're just
[1:31:52] oh god and all god
[1:31:56] and after the service let's lift our
[1:31:59] hands and wash it
[1:32:01] right in that moment of flexibility
[1:32:03] that's when the holy ghost comes down
[1:32:06] and take those things that you have
[1:32:07] identified from your life
[1:32:11] when you start worshipping him thank you
[1:32:13] jesus for your word
[1:32:16] thank you lord for your word because
[1:32:18] when the music is playing you start
[1:32:20] being relaxed you are not afraid again
[1:32:22] oh thank you jesus
[1:32:24] i love you jesus right there then the
[1:32:26] holy ghost start
[1:32:28] dealing with you on those things that he
[1:32:30] have identified
[1:32:40] that's the reason why after the
[1:32:42] preaching of the word
[1:32:44] we must take some time in just
[1:32:45] worshiping
[1:32:47] and just say thank you jesus thank you
[1:32:50] lord
[1:32:52] after the reading of your bible you take
[1:32:54] some time and worship and say thank you
[1:32:56] jesus
[1:32:57] thank you for your word
[1:33:07] are we together
[1:33:11] he says and we nail down and i play in
[1:33:13] and i plead this case before god
[1:33:16] and then i took the word or the promise
[1:33:21] and
[1:33:22] send it forth
[1:33:28] i took the promise and sent it forth
[1:33:34] i love this
[1:33:43] the great holy spirit as he
[1:33:46] talked the word
[1:33:52] to serve the sermon he says a vision
[1:33:56] broke
[1:34:02] praise the lord
[1:34:05] he says a vision broke
[1:34:08] to brother branham it's a vision
[1:34:13] to a person like me or you that don't
[1:34:17] experience vision
[1:34:19] which of course is nothing god can still
[1:34:20] give you vision
[1:34:22] praise the lord vision was not only
[1:34:25] limited to brother branham
[1:34:27] amen
[1:34:31] but what is vision to the believer
[1:34:34] vision is the thing when the scripture
[1:34:38] says
[1:34:39] faith is a substance vision is the
[1:34:44] substance
[1:34:47] so a substance of things hopeful
[1:34:52] has resident in your heart
[1:34:56] and you say thank you jesus i know thank
[1:34:59] you jesus
[1:35:00] blessed be your name you know that you
[1:35:04] have let go of
[1:35:04] it you know you have trusted in his
[1:35:08] hands
[1:35:10] praise the lord
[1:35:13] and there is that substance in your
[1:35:16] heart
[1:35:18] the heavenly never passed away but his
[1:35:21] word
[1:35:24] his word which is his will
[1:35:28] will now pass away
[1:35:34] are we together praise the lord
[1:35:44] the great holy spirit as i took the word
[1:35:48] and served a summon he says
[1:35:51] a vision broke and i saw a man going to
[1:35:54] walls
[1:35:56] the bowling green kentucky with a yellow
[1:35:59] shirt on driving his truck
[1:36:02] and the holy spirit come upon him
[1:36:05] and condemn him
[1:36:09] praise the lord and condemn him
[1:36:13] and the c.o.d brother somewhere brother
[1:36:15] brahm talks about this very story
[1:36:17] he says and the holy spirit
[1:36:20] there he said the holy spirit condemned
[1:36:22] he says and the holy spirit
[1:36:24] brought back to his mind something that
[1:36:27] he was taught
[1:36:28] in sunday school right thou shall nasty
[1:36:32] so you see the word went and
[1:36:36] took a word that was preached
[1:36:42] the word took a word
[1:36:52] thank you jesus
[1:36:55] amen it proved that god
[1:36:58] is the believer of his own word
[1:37:06] enforcing a claim
[1:37:09] whatever you are believing god for
[1:37:11] enforcing the claim
[1:37:13] it's not going on hunger's track right
[1:37:18] now
[1:37:23] if you want to fast it must be a feast
[1:37:26] unto the lord
[1:37:30] it must be a feast unto the lord
[1:37:44] lord i command you right now
[1:37:50] there is an approach to
[1:37:54] everything
[1:37:59] very balances if she's a young lady
[1:38:03] and she knows who she is she will make
[1:38:06] that young man to respect himself
[1:38:08] and swallow every unpleasant words
[1:38:11] from his mouth if you don't approach her
[1:38:15] the right way
[1:38:21] because there is an approach to
[1:38:28] everything
[1:38:30] we together
[1:38:37] he says
[1:38:40] with a yellow shirt on driving the truck
[1:38:43] and the holy spirit come upon him

[1:38:58] over across the river he said i raised
[1:39:02] up
[1:39:03] and i told the brethren dos said the
[1:39:06] lord

[1:39:29] word
[1:39:31] i believe your word
[1:39:35] praise the lord
[1:39:43] in the message talking that's the reason
[1:39:44] why he says we must present the talking
[1:39:47] with our prayers
[1:39:49] what is the talking the word because he
[1:39:54] said when i see the blood i will pass
[1:39:56] over you
[1:39:57] so presenting a promise of god
[1:40:01] reminding god of his promise
[1:40:05] that's why he told moses i remember
[1:40:11] i heard your cried and i remember my
[1:40:13] promise
[1:40:16] he said what is it enforcing giving back

[1:40:33] how are you going to bring him back are
[1:40:36] you going to get into a physical fight
[1:40:37] with the devil
[1:40:39] he says even market the archangel
[1:40:44] said sit on the lord rebuke me
[1:40:51] he never brought no railing accusation
[1:40:56] all because the devil knows how to get
[1:40:57] you in the word game
[1:41:01] he knows how to get you he got jesus one
[1:41:04] time he said it is written
[1:41:08] it is written he will give your angels
[1:41:09] charge over you
[1:41:11] jesus said it is written he said it is
[1:41:12] written he knows how to get into
[1:41:15] right the worst game

[1:41:24] are we together
[1:41:27] he says and if satan has robbed you
[1:41:31] of the privilege of being a son or a
[1:41:33] daughter of god
[1:41:35] we have a right this evening

[1:41:40] holy spirit
[1:41:42] to enforce a claim amen
[1:41:45] amen bring it back how we're enforcing
[1:41:48] that claim
[1:41:49] based on god's word

[1:42:57] the reading of the scripture is very
[1:42:59] important

[1:45:55] that was brought before brother branham
[1:45:57] he never went into any kind of
[1:46:00] emotional movement right
[1:46:04] shake the person's head right no
[1:46:08] because he was solely basing every word
[1:46:12] that he would say
[1:46:13] on the promise of god
[1:46:20] every word
[1:46:27] every word
[1:46:32] he says lord approach this your daughter
[1:46:34] based on the commission
[1:46:37] just just the word
[1:46:41] just a word
[1:46:44] we envelop everything with our emotion
[1:46:46] and you know it and everything
[1:46:48] until god is not in the picture
[1:47:00] and if you see sometimes when god will
[1:47:02] move on
[1:47:03] on our behalf and he would do things
[1:47:10] and let's get to the place of testifying
[1:47:12] about that thing that the lord has done
[1:47:15] we are so much in the picture
[1:47:19] and we talk about you know i trusted i i
[1:47:21] was praying day and night
[1:47:23] i used to believe god i was just reading
[1:47:25] my bible
[1:47:26] and it's just you and you and you and
[1:47:30] you
[1:47:30] and you it's just
[1:47:33] you yeah that's the reason why we want
[1:47:37] quick results because
[1:47:38] we want to publish that ourself i pray
[1:47:41] for this thing and god answer my prayer
[1:47:45] that's why we look for quick results
[1:47:47] because we want
[1:47:48] we won't talk about ourselves
[1:47:58] brother branham says that's the reason
[1:48:00] why
[1:48:02] it's so hard for god to trust a man
[1:48:05] because let him do one thing
[1:48:08] and then he gets so proud
[1:48:11] he talked more about himself than he
[1:48:13] talked about the lord
[1:48:19] praise the lord
[1:48:27] enforcing the claim he said if he
[1:48:33] if he's afflicted you make you sick
[1:48:37] if the devil we have a right before god
[1:48:42] to enforce the law of god oh you know
[1:48:46] the law of god many are the afflictions
[1:48:49] of the righteous
[1:48:51] but you deliver them oh
[1:48:54] by your stripe i'm healed
[1:48:58] it's written in the law just take the
[1:49:01] law of god
[1:49:07] there is a lord of god
[1:49:17] praise the lord and how will you know
[1:49:20] the law of god
[1:49:21] to challenge the devil if you're not
[1:49:23] reading your bible
[1:49:25] if your bible is a stranger to you
[1:49:28] praise the lord i had a friend a friend
[1:49:30] of mine had
[1:49:31] a good friend he's the old preacher
[1:49:35] he says he says he says
[1:49:38] if he says
[1:49:42] if you were accused of being a christian
[1:49:45] he said it would be hard for them to
[1:49:46] convict you
[1:49:57] oh my goodness chuck i likes when he
[1:50:00] says that
[1:50:01] you know he's when he's doing his bible
[1:50:03] studies he likes to tell the people that
[1:50:06] he says we are so we are stranger to to
[1:50:09] to the word of god
[1:50:12] and if you were convicted of being a
[1:50:14] christian it would be hard for them to
[1:50:17] convict you because there is not enough
[1:50:22] evidence
[1:50:24] praise the lord
[1:50:28] are we together
[1:50:33] there is a lord of god by his tribe
[1:50:36] we are here amen bring him back
[1:50:42] turn him loose
[1:50:47] you are taking him out the end of death
[1:50:50] and we clean him
[1:50:52] bring him back but what are we basing
[1:50:55] our claim on
[1:50:56] the lord we are basing our claim
[1:51:01] on the lord which is the word of god
[1:51:12] we are basing our claim on the word of
[1:51:18] god
[1:51:27] praise the lord he says that's the
[1:51:31] enforcement back
[1:51:34] to the natural condition again
[1:51:37] a man is sick a baby is sick woman is
[1:51:40] sick
[1:51:40] he says and they are out of their
[1:51:43] natural condition
[1:51:44] then we have a right to enforce
[1:51:47] our claim not our claim
[1:51:52] he says is our claim because
[1:51:56] god give it to us by his tribe
[1:52:01] we is by his and we
[1:52:07] praise the lord
[1:52:19] right in there you can see the one that
[1:52:22] is benefiting
[1:52:25] amen the one that has paid
[1:52:29] the price and the one that received the
[1:52:31] benefit
[1:52:33] by his tribe we are healed
[1:52:36] and it's the same that god so behold
[1:52:39] i send you elijah hello
[1:52:45] praise the lord before i send you elijah
[1:52:56] ruth i mean now me told ruth
[1:52:59] and says you are better to me than seven
[1:53:02] sons
[1:53:06] praise the lord you are better to me
[1:53:11] than seven sons because if i could have
[1:53:15] seven sons and lost all of them i mean i
[1:53:17] would have never
[1:53:19] been able to restore all that was lost
[1:53:24] right
[1:53:28] praise the lord amen god
[1:53:32] was so thinking about a people in this
[1:53:34] age
[1:53:35] that he had to send a prophet
[1:53:40] i will tell you god's brow is so
[1:53:42] important to him
[1:53:50] behold i sent you
[1:53:54] elijah but how many times that we talk
[1:53:58] about elijah
[1:53:59] and we don't talk about the one that
[1:54:01] elijah was sento
[1:54:11] it's right there they want that benefit
[1:54:18] the wonder benefit is the one that
[1:54:20] elijah was saying tall
[1:54:24] we benefit that's what that prophet of
[1:54:27] god would say they gave was not for me
[1:54:29] was for the people
[1:54:32] it was because of a people a bride yes
[1:54:37] a people that god want to bring to rest
[1:54:40] is because of a people that god wants to
[1:54:43] bring to rest
[1:54:44] he want to take us from the struggle of
[1:54:46] our mind
[1:54:54] take us from church works and church
[1:54:57] laws
[1:54:57] and bring us to rest
[1:55:00] he had to send
[1:55:04] a man a prophet
[1:55:11] that he prayed must trip him of
[1:55:12] everything
[1:55:14] so you and myself can have the benefit
[1:55:19] to know who god is to know what the holy
[1:55:23] ghost
[1:55:23] is to be able to experience god
[1:55:27] not just read a book and talk about
[1:55:29] jeremiah and talk about isaiah
[1:55:31] but to be able to experience god in our
[1:55:34] own lives
[1:55:39] where we can sit in the backseat praise
[1:55:42] the lord
[1:55:43] and see god waving through our lives
[1:55:47] and see his grace waving through our
[1:55:51] lives
[1:55:52] and changing our lives
[1:55:56] helping us we see habits going away
[1:56:02] praise the lord things that we struggle
[1:56:05] with and we struggle with
[1:56:06] we see them flying away
[1:56:12] that's why he sent a prophet
[1:56:16] so you can benefit
[1:56:19] so you can be able to experience god
[1:56:23] for god to be personal to you
[1:56:32] you forcing it clean
[1:56:36] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:56:41] when there is there is an accident or
[1:56:43] whatever it is
[1:56:45] the insurance company they got to get
[1:56:47] their lawyer
[1:56:49] if they want to have that other company
[1:56:51] to pay back for your vehicle they got to
[1:56:53] get a good lawyer
[1:56:54] they gotta get a man that knows the bulk
[1:57:00] not the man that's wearing a badge a man
[1:57:02] that knows the book
[1:57:06] because he has to be able to flip the
[1:57:07] pages and find the lord
[1:57:10] for the claim
[1:57:14] praise the lord oh glory be to god
[1:57:17] tonight
[1:57:19] amen you love the lord tonight
[1:57:26] he's the one that enforced our claim
