========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] age, a certain thing to happen. And we find out that it happened just exactly like it. And he said that he would do because he's rich in his mercy to always have mercy to fulfill every word that he has promised. He has to do it and always in order to stay God. Always he does this. His word always comes to pass in its season. His seed that he has sold into the earth, what did he do? He put it here in the word and that's a seed. And every time the age comes along, that seed ripens up and then uh reformation comes forth and he promised it and it does that. Now, we did not deserve these things. We did not deserve these blessings of God because we had went out after the things of the world. One in the air of Cain. Cain building a nice altar and a nice church and putting flowers up on it and thought that's exactly what it was. It was a bunch of apples or pears or pomegrants or whatever it was and his father and mother had eaten in the Garden of Eden. It run them out and so he offered that back to God and God rejected it. But Abel by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. And today the Bible said in Jude that they have run in the way of Cain. Perished in the gain sand of Kora. See running the way of Cain, building altars, building churches, denominations, making it flowery big more members than the rest of them. taken in things. Anything that come along and jumped up and down or shook hands or was baptized a certain way or spoke in tongues or run through the floor, they put their name on the book. That's right. And then turn on the real truth that be preached and denied. How can it be? So notice what a mess we were in. Notice and the Bible said, "And they went in the way of Balum and perished in the gaining of Kora." perished in the gain s What was the gain saint of Kora? Well, you think you're the only holy man? Well, God's all of us are holy. The whole church is all right. Every all of us get together. That's what we ought to do. That's where they perish. That and we truly deserved it. We deserve to be that. But God, rich in mercy, has pulled us out of that chaos and let us see it before the thing hits here. rich in his mercy and sent us back a revival of divine healing and the coming again of the power of God. According to history, no revival ever lasted over three years. This revival carried for 15 years. It's been a burning fires around and around the world. Why? Because we deserved it. God rich in his mercy. Not because we desired it or because we deserved it rather. Just think of what it's done. I think of one of your sisters right here in Phoenix that many of you know, Miss Hattie Waldraw. She had cancer of the heart and she was in the prayer line up here when brother Moore and I were here the first time about 15 18 years ago and she was dying with cancer of the heart and she should have been dead a long time ago but God rich in mercy sent his power upon her and he saved her life and she's living today. God, rich in mercy, Congressman Upshaw, a great man. Uh I think he was the president or something of the of the Baptist uh Southern Baptist Convention at one time or vice president or something. He had done all he was a good man. He did all that he knowed how to do. He'd went to every doctor. Nobody could do nothing for him. He was bound down. Ministers had prayed for him. He'd had a gallon of oil or a poured on his head, anointing of different ministers everywhere. One night, Los Angeles, California, walking up to the pull pit, looking a bunch of wheelchairs about twice, three times, and watch sitting there all up and down the aisles back and forth. And then there laid over there a cop with a little colored girl and little negro uh girl. And her her mother was sitting by her. and my brother had bringing the prayer line up and I was looking knowing not what was going on and I seen a doctor with tardis shell glasses operating on a little negro girl for a throat condition and she paralyzed and I looked around I thought where is the child at I couldn't see her after a while way down there no hopely little girl about seven or eight years old to be paralyzed the rest of her life there was her mother down there on her knees praying. Then I said, "This doctor operated on your little girl into scrap." She said, "That's right, sir." Then she tried to get the baby to the platform. They told her not to do it. They tried to quieten her down. By the time they got her quiet, I thought, "Well, we'll get a chance to pray for her." In a few minutes, maybe people right here was there that night. And I was looking out over the audience. I seen that little girl going down look like to a a little narrow road with a dial in her arms rocking that doll. No matter how much the doctor said that she was going to be paralyzed the rest of her life, God rich in mercy sent down the Holy Spirit by a vision. And that little girl got up out of there and she and her mother took hold of hands and walked down through that aisle praising God. Way back there said an old man, Congressman Upshaw. Many of you knows his testimony. He had been a good man. Tried all of his life 66 years and in a wheelchair pushed in bed crutches under his arms that he walked with never no more to walk normal. And there he sat there looking on that. All of a sudden, I looked out and saw a vision. There he come walking down across the top of that audience. Bound his head could walk as good as anybody. I didn't know who the man was. I said, "There's a great man sitting back there. He fell off of a wagon when he was a little boy or onto a hayframe and hurt his back. They bored holes in the floor to keep the vibration when the people walk from striking on his back." I said, 'He becomes a great man and he keeps growing greater. He's sitting in a great circle at the White House. And then this man come and told me, he said, "That's Congressman Upshaw. Did you ever hear him?" I said, "Never heard of him." And so he run a little extension mic back there and it was talking back and forth. Then I started to look around. I seen the old congressman coming walking towards me in a vision just as perfect and normal as he could be. God rich in mercy pulled him from that wheelchair and he walked without crutches till the day he died. God rich in mercy when doctors had failed when science had failed when everything else had failed. God was rich in mercy. The congressman upshaw I think of myself as a little old boy. I remember as a people call me a day a woman hater. The reason it was is because I seen so much immorality. out of women when I was a kid. I hated them and I don't do that now because I know there's some good ones. But I remember how it was so bad, so immoral. And I thought my I I'll never be around where people's at. I have no education so I won't get any. And little old kid sitting there, not even a shirt on with my uh uh coat pinned up like this with a safety pin and it real hot. And the teacher said, "William, aren't you hot with that coat on?" I said, "No, ma'am. I'm a little bit chilly." And she made me go over to the stove and and put some wood in the stove, and I like to burn up. I I I didn't have no shirt that whole season through. And I thought if I could ever get the money sometime, and I could get a little uh get me a 3030 rifle, I come out west here and live out here and hunt for the rest of my life. I didn't want nothing to do with people. Just stay away because they didn't like me and and I just stay away from them. And then every time I go downtown to talk to anybody, see some fellas on the street, I knew I'd say hello there, John, Jim, how are you? Oh, hello. See, they didn't want to talk to me. Didn't want nothing to do with me because of my daddy and them that made whiskey. And I I didn't do that. It was nothing I done and I would have been that type. But now I said to the wife not long ago, my wall is plastered with the best guns that can be bought. Oh, and I think of them old dirty clothes tonight. I've got two or three good suits and no friends. I have to hide out in the wilderness to keep away from people. What's the matter? Is it because of my personality? Is it because of my education? No. God, rich in mercy saw me in that condition and he saved me. I remember being led by the arms as a blind man. I could not see. Everything in front of me was a blur. I'd be blind the rest of my life. But God rich in mercy restored back my sight. I'm 55 years old and still got good sight. God rich in mercy is the only thing I can say. Once the church had no provided way of healing. They had one but they turned it down. But God rich in mercy has sent them a gift of divine healing. That is the Holy Spirit among us confirming the word with signs following. God rich in mercy. I have two or three pages sure of these notes, but I ain't going to try to strike them because I'm I'm conscious that it's almost time to start that prayer line. But God rich in his mercy. Many of you here tonight, the doctors turned you down. There's people sitting in them wheelchairs. They probably never come out of there. They are there to stay. Some of them paralyzed in different ways. They would never couldn't come out. There's no way for them to come out. But God, rich in his mercy, has provided an atonement. Don't turn it down. Receive it. There's man out there with heart trouble. There's people with cancers that the doctors can do nothing with. You're hopeless, helpless in this world. But God rich in his mercy has sent down the Holy Ghost and right here now to confirm the word to prove that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Yes. Amen. Because we deserve it because God is rich in his mercy. Amen. Amen. Now, that's the one. That's the person. It's that Lord Jesus. He is not dead, but he has risen from the dead. And he's alive forever more. And he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Still just as rich in his mercy as he was to the woman that had a blood issue. And she started through the crowd. There was no hopes for her. The doctors had done all they could do. She had a blood issue. She was dying. And she touched the master's garment. God rich in mercy turned around and told her of her condition and she was healed of this blood issue. A little foul prostitute went up to a well one day to get some water. No hope. She'd been excommunicated from the virgins from around the people. Her life was no good. And she thought, "What's the use of trying? I'm turned out there's nothing left for me." But she looked standing over on the side or sitting by the side of the well and there was a man sitting there who told her all things that she has ever done. God rich in his mercy. That same God tonight just as rich in his mercy and just the same as he was in that day. God rich. I think we have 200 prayer cards out here or what we've called out in 200. We're going to call them and let the people line up. We're going to pray for them. But before we do it, that there be some newcomers here to get away from all superstitions. This is not a superstition. It is a manifestation of a promise of God. It depends on what you no virtue in any man. There's no power in no man. But we as believers have authority. Not power, but authority. Someone asked me not long ago said, "Brother Fran, you believe you got power to do this? I ain't got no power at all. But I've got authority." Every believer has it. If you refuse it, you'll stay where you're at. But if you'll accept it, it'll do the exceeding abundance because God is rich in his mercy. Take a little policeman stand out here on the street, his clothes hanging half off of him. He's just skinny. The the cap's got his ears pulled down and he walk out there where cars are coming down that street at 50 miles an hour, 300 horsepower motors in him. He hasn't got the power to stop a bicycle. That's right. But just let him go that whistle and hold up that hand and watch the brake squeak. He hasn't got power, but he's got authority. The whole city is behind him. And when a man or a woman, I don't care what condition you're in, you've got the authority of God by promise because it's rich and promised to do exceedingly abundantly. If you say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you've said will come to pass, you can have what you've said. You got no power, but you got authority. Remember when he told me back there said, "You'll be able to reveal the secrets of the heart." Do you remember that? Many of you Phoenix people, he promised it. What he promises, he does. Now, there's some of you here that hasn't got prayer cards. No doubt. How many sick and don't have prayer cards? Raise up your hands. All right. If you want to know not authority, not power, but the authority of the word, the things that I do shall you also. Jesus promised in Luke 17:30 that just before his coming there would be like the time of no Moses or Noah when they were eating and drinking and giving in marriage and knew not to the day that Noah entered into the ark. He said to be that time. Then he said also as it was in the days of Lot and said this will take place in that day when the son of man shall be revealed. when the son of man is revealed in the last days. Now look what he how the son of man revealed himself in the person of this angel which was the son of man. Absolutely. Abraham called him Elohim. He was a son of man. Revealed himself just before the gentile world was burned. How did he do it to the believer? To the makebeliever. He sent two preachers down to preach to him. But to the real believer, he stood with his back to the tent and he said, "Abraham, is Abram the day a few days before that, but now he's Abraham. Where is thy wife?" Sarah said, "She's in the tent behind you." Said, "I'm going to keep my promise to you. I'm going to visit you." Oh, Abraham was a hundred years old and Sarah was 90, but God, rich in mercy, kept his promise. Amen. They brought the baby because God's merciful and he full of mercy. He's rich in mercy. He keeps his promise. Notice with his back turned to the tent. Sarah laughed and said, "How could these things be? I'm old. How can I have pleasure with my husband as a a young married woman? Why he's 100 years old? Our family relationship has ceased many, many years ago. How could this be?" And she laughed about it. And the angel with the son of man with his back turned to the to the tent said, "Why did Sarah laugh? How can these things be?" What was it Jesus said in St. Luke 17:30 that and the days like it was in the days of Lot? Same situation before the gentile world is burned up. He said the son of man will reveal himself in that day. Amen. He made the promise that Malachi 4 promised us it would a message would come forth that would restore the people back to the original Pentecostal message and with the same blessings they had on the day. What is it? It's a two-winged eagle both new and old testament plumping its promises together of God to fulfill what the promises of the Bible said it would do. Amen. God rich in mercy would not let his people go out this denominational rich in goods and things of the world later see a church age but he didn't make a way of escape believe it people go bless you amen God rich in mercy the mercies of God that's the only thing that I desiremen Not his righteousness, not his law, but his mercy is what I call for. God be merciful to me. We all have that feeling. I was watching. There's a little woman sitting out here on the end of the seat. You have a prayer card out there, lady. You don't. Let me show you God's rich and mercy. You've been real nervous here lately, haven't you? Real bad. In your eyes has gotten worse. Isn't that right? That's right. Now, they're going to change.

There's such a little bitty fellow sitting right there in front of kind of a sitting right out here. He's suffering with a growth on his body. It's just recently come on there recently.

You don't need one. God rich in his mercy. Oh, brother, sister, believe God. Don't doubt him. Believe him. That's right. Hallelujah. Here sets a man, grace suit, glasses on. Look at here, sir. Do you believe God's rich in his mercy? You're sitting there with a hernia. Do you believe that God can heal that hernia and make you well sitting right here on the end of seat looking at me? If you believe that God can heal that hernia, God will do that to you if you'll accept it. Do you believe it? Will you accept it? All right. You can have it if you'll just believe it. Have mercy. Yes, sir. There's a lady sitting out here. She's suffering with poor circulation in her body. But if she will believe, God will heal her. If she believes it, I believe she's going to miss it as sure as anything. I have mercy is my prayer. If I could see the woman's Mrs. Riley, do you believe that God can heal that poor circulation? If you will receive it, amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Just believe. Hallelujah. God is good, isn't he, Stella? I never seen a woman in my life, but God in his mercy. There sets another woman sitting right back behind there, right in the back, looking right at me. She also, she's got poor circulation, too. She's thinking about it just then. I never seen a woman in my life been at this other woman had the same thing. Look at me. Do you believe me to be God's prophet or his servant? You also have heart trouble. If that's right, raise up your hand. You don't have it now. God rich in his mercy is showing forth that he's alive here in the building tonight. God rich in his mercy. Amen. Could there be How many sinners and backsliders would stand to your feet and say, "God rich in his mercy, be merciful to me. Stand to your feet."
