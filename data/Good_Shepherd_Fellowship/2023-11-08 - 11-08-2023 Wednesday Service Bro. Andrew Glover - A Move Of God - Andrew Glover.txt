tonight I know we're here on a Wednesday evening and it's a midweek service but I believe God moves the same on Wednesdays as he does Sundays or any other day of the week amen simply because he's God Amen and what his word said he would do he's doing amen amen let's just buy our hearts together tonight for a word of prayer how many have a special need upon your heart something you would desire from the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we believe you're here tonight among us we believe you're the same yesterday today and forever father we believe that wherever two or three are gathered together in Your Name Lord you made a promise that you would come and be in our midst and father as I look across this room tonight in the sanctuary Lord there's more than two or three here tonight but Lord there's a room full of Believers here a church full of Believers that believe you in the power of your resurrection and Lord as we take these next few moments and look away from the things of the day the cares of life the cares of our world of our jobs of our things oh god father we're looking to you tonight to come on the scene Lord manifest yourself Among Us in a supernatural way Lord you know every heart you know every need that's represented here father we're inviting you come Among Us in a special way and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen amen God bless you this evening you love the Lord amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to uh go straight to the scripture we don't want to prolong the time we want to turn to the Book of Genesis the first chapter the Book of Genesis the first chapter and we also want to just take this moment to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus we sure count it an honor and a privilege to be here with you once again and I know it's a a little uh just to stop over here tonight but I'm sure thankful for the opportunity to come and to see you all and speak to you again from the message of the hour we sure appreciate Brother Juan and his friendship and the open door here to to visit the Believers and amen I believe God's doing some wonderful things among us Amen in the Book of Genesis the first chapter I want to begin reading in the first verse it's a very familiar reading here in Genesis 1:1 the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep I want you to watch these next words and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters in the book of Deuteronomy the 32nd chapter Deuteronomy the 32nd chapter in the 11th verse why you're turning there brother why I don't know if it' be possible to turn this air off up here here but I feel a little cool air if that's possible maybe just to turn it up in Deuteronomy 32 and verse 11 I know you're familiar with this scripture the prophet of God uses it in his message as the eagle stirreth up her nest in the 11th verse he says as an eagle stirreth up her nest now watch this word here fluth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings and taketh them and beareth them on her wings now watch this so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him now what I like about verse 11 is the same word in Genesis 1 2 and the spirit of God moved the same word moved is now in Deuteronomy 32:11 and it's as fluth so the spirit of God moved here the spirit flutter Earth over her young spread abroad her wings and taketh them and beareth them on her wings amen we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon uh how many thanks the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen we we truly believe the word of God is the truth it's the infallible amen inspired word of the Living God uh here from those passages of scripture tonight I want to for just a few moments if I could maybe just to speak to you here and if I would title this tonight I want to talk to you for a few moments on a move of God Amen a move of God you know uh as we were just singing the song a few moments ago my Lord knows just what I need I was just uh some time ago praying and in prayer uh this thought come to me and I pinned it down uh just in prayer it struck my heart that what we think we need amen is one thing but what God knows we need is another amen there's times that we think we know what we need but in reality we really don't know what we need amen but that's when we're thankful that we serve a God who knows exactly what we need and I believe tonight if we would all be honest with ourselves we need amen a move of God how many would agree we need a move of God we need a move of God that comes from God and comes from his word now in the message of the hour brother brand will tell us about 47 different times he will use this term move of God Amen now when you start thinking about a move of God you realize amen that in order to have a move of God there has to be a power supplied Amen to produce that move so God must Supply the power Amen in order to start a move of God now the prophet says it very beautiful he says a man amen cannot lay in the presence of God and a church cannot stay in the presence of God Amen under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down amen and gives unction and power to start a move of God in there amen among those people so in other words amen that you cannot separate a move of God God from the presence of God now many people we find in this world they actually fear and even around the ranks of what we call the message amen people will actually begin to fear a move of God now the reason they do that amen is because so many has turned amen a move of God into fanaticism now let me just start off by saying this amen and let's remove all doubt amen that God still moves how many can witness tonight amen that God still moves amen I believe amen that God still moves in our singing I believe it I believe that God Amen still moves in our preaching I believe that God moves in our worship you know amen I believe that God still moves in prayer lines I believe like the prophet of God said amen that God still moves in altar call he said the oldfashioned altar call amen they're out of style today amen but God still moves in them amen they're out of style to the world Amen but God still moves in them he said now watch can't you feel it amen moving on you church now amen I love that word the prophet uses there he says can't you feel it now let's identify amen what he's asking you if you can feel he said Can You Feel the holy ghost moving on you so it's not just feeling the singing right or feeling the the the atmosphere or the emotion the crow but it's actually to feel the spirit of God now amen in the message the deity of Jesus Jesus Christ he said who are you this morning excuse me who is Christ Jesus amen he's in you as much as you'll let him be see he's pressing sorry trying to get into you Amen to move into you today now think about this Jesus Christ is pressing how many believes he's pressing he's pressing amen trying to get into you Amen to move into you and you stand off and wonder and look and gaze and hold back a while don't do that excuse me move right straight into the kingdom of God now watch a prophet the hour is here how many believes the hour is here you believe it I don't believe the hour is coming I believe it's here amen I believe it's here amen the prophet said now watch move right straight in the kingdom of God oh how I love him see his power is moving what makes the people cry and shout and go on what's the matter it's the holy ghost moving in them if they could only realize and embrace him embrace the holy ghost believing in him hug him to your bosom he said live right and do nothing that would hinder him say oh Lord I want you I want you to stand by me I'm going to stand by you father and as you do he's just pressing to get into you because he wants in there amen he's wooing to you him he's wooing you to him amen all the time now amen how many believes the holy spirit is here tonight wooing I I believe as the prophet said the spirit of God Broods over the congregation amen then the spirit of God is here tonight and he's wooing you to him all the time now why is he wooing you to him he's wooing you to him in order to gain access into your life now you all know that as we come in church sometimes amen and while you're sitting there amen you'll feel a pressure you'll feel maybe a pressure in the song service or a pressure when you go to raise your hands now I want to say this not all the pressure amen that you feel in a service it's not always a negative pressure because the prophet said now he's here and he's more willing to do it than you are to receive it amen Jesus Christ the son of God is here he's more willing to do it than you are to receive it see could you imagine brother Bosworth expressing this ocean out here piled up into one tube about two foot or two foot across amen what a pressure there would be trying to find amen one little crevice to leak through now if you had all the water that was in the ocean amen and you put all that water up on a pipe amen and that pipe has got to contain that water amen but the only way it can get in there is it finds a crack amen that it can get into and then flow through that how much pressure amen is laying upon that pipe he said now divide that by 10,000 time thousand and you'll find the pressure of the holy spirit amen trying to find that little crevice in the heart amen that true Faith Can leak into there and to heal you amen the pressure that you feel in the service amen is coming from the power of the Holy Ghost amen that is building upon song after song Amen and word after word and sermon amen the pressure begins to build amen and what he's doing is he's looking for a heart that he can get into and heal through that heart other place he said God's standing there amen like a great pressure don't you be afraid amen there'll be too many of them you cannot exhaust God could you imagine a little rat about that long little mouse out of the great Garners of Egypt saying I better eat one grain of wheat a day I might run out before the next Harvest could you imagine a little fish about that long amen swimming out in the middle of the ocean say I better drink of this water and sparely because you know it might go dry sometime amen that's trying to exhaust God's goodness and mercy to his people he wants to bless you amen he's ready he's pressing could you imagine taking all the waters in the Earth the Seas and everything and piling it in one 4ft pipe and put up there amen the pressure would be on the bottom of it amen trying to find a little crevice to leak its way through he said that's like the pressure of the holy spirit amen trying to come down on every life amen the pressure of the holy spirit is trying to get into our young people he's trying to get into our marriages he's trying to get into our churches amen and the reason he's trying to get in there is so that his Spirit can move in there amen and a spiritual move of God Amen will fix more than 5 minutes amen that we could counsel all night long amen I believe that when God moves things change listen friends when God moved on the face of the waters he took a garden of chaos and created an Eden out of it when the spirit of God moved and if that Spirit can move upon natural creation then what can it do in the lives of sons Daughters of God Amen God Is Right amen his word is Right others are not right that's right as long as they stay with the word but when you leave the word then you leave God cuz God is watching over his word amen why is he watching over his word to vindicate it because he's got to make it real he's got to make it act he said that's why you people are hungering for Revival it's time for these things to be here and if you ever believe me to know what I was talking about about you accept that amen the hour is here now you accept that the hour is here now but the trouble of it is we got so many absolutes we don't know where we're tied to and I feel religious he said I want to say it we got so many ties one pulling this way one that way one against the other how do the people know what to do he said and the pressure of the holy spirit is coming down trying to find a place Amen to move himself into that he can work word by word amen word by word so there's all kinds of pressure there's the pressure of this is against that amen and this don't believe this and that amen there's all kinds of pressure amen but there's a more positive pressure amen then all the divisions and the confusions and the arguments amen there's a pressure of the Holy Ghost and he's trying to get into you Amen to work word by word now when you think about this you have to realize it's the unseen force of the Holy Spirit the prophet said the doctor said to me long ago said Billy don't you think them people's excited amen them people just excited no sir I don't he said well that's nervousness because they scream and they holler and they go on I said Doctor you mean to tell me that nerves can be excited without something to excite them amen something has to excite them he said so what's there I said it's the Unseen force of the Holy Ghost that moving among us and it excites that Born Again Spirits listen friends the Holy Ghost the rain will fall on the just and the unjust am but here's the difference it will fall on the unjust but it will not move to the unjust it'll fall upon the unjust but they'll just be a partaker of the same nourishment amen but unto you that have eyes to see and are heart to receive when the Holy Ghost falls on you the pressure of the Holy Ghost finds on way into your soul and he begins to work word by word by word glory to God hallelujah and the spirit of God will excite that Born Again Spirit he said see it brings an excitement of that spirit amen the power of God Amen just Foams down through amen Faith cometh by hearing and the Holy Ghost takes the word and he spreads it out over the people Amen to catch it with a power amen that reads generated Born Again life amen something has got to cry out when that word from the spirit gets in that heart listen friends every one of you tonight have got a crevice in your heart amen and the power of the Holy Ghost is here tonight amen looking for a way to get into your heart to work through your life word by word see that's why it's more than just shouting right that's why it's more than just dancing We Believe believe in all those things amen but the unjust will not allow the word amen to work through them but there's a bride on the earth tonight who is a word born bride and the only thing she moves by is the word see that's why the Bible said amen that the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake amen as they were moved by the Holy Ghost amen go read your Bible do you realize how Paul amen wrote the things he wrote is there was a crevice in his heart amen listen he was in all kinds of pressure he was under prison pressure he was under political pressure amen Paul was under all kinds of pressure but he did not write about those things amen he wrote about those things that got into him amen and what got into him was the Revelation amen of the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and so Paul did not write about the prison he did not write about the conditions he wrote of the anointing the word the Revelation that was coming to him can I give you another example amen look at John on the aisle of patmas Do You Realize John was under pressure yes yes he was on the aisle of patmas Amen where the most where the most criminal of criminals were put amen do you realize if it was not for history we would have no understanding of what Paul or what John Rather was in on the aisle of patmas brother brother Juan he's surrounded by snakes he surrounded by scorpions he's surrounded by all kinds of horrible things but nowhere in the Book of Revelation do you read about the Scorpions do you read about the snakes you know why because John did not think those things amen were worth his time Amen to record in the word so what he did record was the things he seen when he got carried away by the spirit oh Church of the Living God that's what we need to do is get carried away amen by the spirit of God until we see beyond the things we see we hear beyond the things we hear we believe beyond the things our eyes and our smell and our feel is declared we can believe things by the super sense we can declare things by that super sense when the spirit of God moves amen I love this the prophet said in the last days when the evening lights begin to shine eyes will become open and you'll see where you're going he said then the body is already for formed amen standing upon its feet amen taking motion amen moving by the Holy Spirit what the same one that moved up on the prophets that wrote the Bible is the same Holy Ghost that's moving in a body filled with the Holy Ghost out of every organization every Kindred every tongue and every people see then the holy ghost moving among the church is what's causing people Amen to Hunger for More Than Just Church yes it's causing them to Hunger for More Than Just hearing intellectual sermons it's causing something in them to hunger for the realities of God see it's begin to be a talk Among Us he said and oh may it revive us to a spot that we'll go to searching hungering and pulling for the realities of God because God is a reality do you realize the Gospel of Jesus Christ is more than a book it's more than a letter the gospel is a reality brother said stay on the highway stay on the road map go the way the disciples went go the word they preached live it testify I know it to be the truth he said see signs to the last days God living in man it's God's program God has to find somebody that he can trust somebody he can have confidence in and can have confidence in God that can believe him said and then when he finds such a man that he can put his confidence and his power in amen a man that'll follow the road that'll stay right on the map see go right on till he comes to the place of power now watch faith will lead him to that because he's got faith in the word he'll lead him to the power and power will lead him to the promise amen so faith will lead him to the power amen and the power will lead him to the promise and then when he gets the promise and begins to manifest what does it do amen it blinds the eyes of the unbelieving lukewarm amen Creed servant brother can you remember that point for a few moments when a man finds the faith of God and the faith of God leads him to the power of God the power of God will lead him to the promise of God and when that man receives the power and the promise it will open his eyes amen but it'll blind his Creed servant lukewarm unbeliev brother he said that's what he did back there in the days of Jesus he said if I would have not come you would not have known sin but now that I'm here now that I'm here you have no excuse and today if God made his promise that he would send the holy ghost in the last days these things would take place you could have doubted it but now he's come and he's doing it and the world is without excuse It's aund cross Nation after Nation amen Thunder rather after place after a place let cover the Earth they're without excuse they wouldn't have known it if God hadn't come and brought it but he's brought to us now and so then it's a reality it's the realities of following the word following the truth so faith will lead a man to the power of God and the power of God will lead a man the promise of God and the next step is that promise will be manifested in the life of the believer and the word will become a reality amen because there'll be following the truth of God listen friends I say this if you have a hunger and a thirst in your soul for for a move of God you're a blessed person you may not have a dollar in your bank account and you might have had to bum away to church amen but if you got a hunger in your soul amen for the spirit of God to move you are the richest person in the state tonight because God has put that there and everything you've been through couldn't take it every devil that you fought couldn't kill it everything you've been through couldn't destroy because there's something on the inside of you that's declaring there's a God that can move the Bible said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after what righteousness for they shall be filled that word hunger means to suffer want it means to be needy to Crave to seek with eager desire that word thirst means those who are said to thirst who painfully feel the want and eagerly long for those things which the soul is refreshed supported and strengthened amen amen they're they're they're hungering amen they're thirsting they're painfully Desiring something amen that will refresh their soul that will support their soul and will strengthen their soul listen this thirst is not in your flesh this thirst is not in your spirit the control tower is in your soul amen and whatever the spirit of God will move upon you amen will refresh your soul he will strengthen your soul he will support your soul listen friends I just feel like preaching here for a second amen cuz at my be a Wednesday night amen but the same God Amen that refreshed your soul on Sunday and strengthened your soul on Sunday and supported your soul on Sunday has come down here tonight in the power of his resurrection to strengthen your soul again to refresh your soul again to support your soul again I say open up the windows of heaven and let the refreshing of the presence of God break out in the church until our souls are refreshed yeah well glory to God anyhow are you hearing me amen I'm talking about somebody that believes the spirit of God can move and change the situation remember said many times systems lead men but down in their heart they want to see the move of God come on Church down in their heart where that crevice is where the pressure of the holy spirit is where the power of God can leak in there they want to see the move of God then we find out the devil don't do one thing he'll do another so if the devil won't do one thing he'll do another and then he will mess up something or G up something and it makes them kindly pull back a little bit now do you know what that is that's a devil any time something's fixing to break is when everything else falls apart now y'all know I'm talking to you said getting an airplane he said and go up in the airplane and take off and he said the closer you get to the sound barrier he said The more rattling the plane becomes he said you feel like it's going to fall apart he said it starts shaking he said now listen if it was up to you you would pull back he said and if you pull back you'll never break the sound barrier you'll never know there's something beyond what you're used to that's right but if you can pull the propeller and set your wings and no matter how loud the plane Roars no matter how much shaking going on you know as soon as I break that sound barrier there's an unlimited speed come on church and the prophet of God said amen we got to break our own sound barrier come on is that what he said he said we got to break our own sound barrier he said and when we break the unbelief barrier he said there'll be unlimited Revival there'll be unlimited anointing there'll be unlimited Mir are you hearing me church I believe it's time for the Bride of Jesus Christ to break every barrier I think it's time to break the sound barrier I think it's time to break the the doubt barrier I think it's time to break the complex barrier I think it's time to break every barrier and break out into a dimension with God Amen where we can go beyond the things that we're used to hey come on Church well that's going to fall apart so we better pull back amen that's what the devil does to you when you begin to feel that breakthrough in the service it's going to fall apart so pull back that's a time to preach harder come on church that's a time to pull harder because we are not of those that draw back I'm going to tell you what a prophet said there's always difficulty in the way so if you're waiting for a service where there's no difficulty it's not going to happen Satan throws everything he can in the way when he sees a real move of God gets started he'll do it to you he'll put everything all the hindrances he can in your way now watch a prophet but we know that the word is a discerner right he said and we pray that you'll discern our hearts and reveal to us our causes that's hindering the great move of God in this last day so God is not going to let you come up to the barrier and then back up and say there's no way I can break it but the word is a deser oh God the word is a discerner of the thought and the intent have you ever been there have you ever been in a service and the word is coming forth and something in your heart is saying that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth and then the preacher says and it's for you and you want to raise your hands but then all of a sudden the little Spirit of condemnation comes over and hangs over you and says you cannot raise your hand you cannot say amen and then watch that preacher watch that preacher turn and say but Paul said there is therefore not now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus do you see what just happened the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intention so you were that close to Breaking the Barrier but some old devil of condemnation crawled up out of hell and hung over your life but because God is determined for you to get a breakthrough woo glory god is determined for you to get a breakthrough he will cause the anointed Ministry to rebuke that spirit and from there may go anointed ministers anointed men and women with such an inspiration on them of the loving Lord Jesus until there'll be a Revival breakout all the way across the continent God can use you to cause a Revival all across the continent now the move of God let me say this a move of God starts with God moving on his church coming into his church and proving he's the same yesterday today and forever you know what a move of God does can I I know this is simple but I pray it helps you you know what a move of God starts with it starts with people refusing to settle for less than what God promised them a move of God starts with a people who refuses to settle for less than what God promised them you know what a move of God is it's something out of the routine a move of God is Not ritualistic and neither is it traditional and a move of God is Not theological a move of God is the spirit of God finding a crevice in the heart of a Believer to lead him to the faith and the power and the promise and the manifestation now if you read the Bible you know in the Book of John the n9th chapter amen that there was a boy that was born blind right and the Bible says in verse 29 we know that God spake unto Moses but as for this fell we know not from when he is now watch this and the man answered and said un them why hearing is a marvelous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes do you realize in that day I'm just preaching to you in that day the church was a cold old formal ritualistic LED Church by the ideas of the rabbis that someday Messiah will come someday God will do something someday there'll be a power amen someday he'll come and the sick will be healed the dead will be raised the blind eyes will be open the deaf ears will hear that's what was being taught in the synagogue but here's a young boy who had a crevice in his heart he had a crevice in his heart and he could feel the pressure of the rabbi's teaching he could feel the pressure of all the ideas about the Messiah amen but there was something in his heart amen that come in contact with faith amen and the faith led him to the power and the power led him to the promise and the promise was Jesus Christ the word made manifest in front of him are you hearing me now he's blind and all of a sudden something leaks into his heart something moves in his heart and the war and the Lord speaks to him and says here is your side rubs the the mud in his eyes and the boy com seeing right now watch this the blind boy looks at them leaders and says well you're the spiritual leaders of the nation and here comes a man and opens My Eyes by the power of God and yet you don't know nothing about him he said this is a marvelous thing he had something didn't he he sure did all right a man man could do this yet they did oh God yet they didn't know whence he was now watch a prophet the boy of John nine watch him tied to today and says now look today Brethren see we know we have a move of God we know we have a move of God we're not looking for a move of God we're not trying to fast a move of God we're not trying to pray up a move of God we have a move of of God he said and we know it's performing Miracles it's Healing The Sick it's even raising the dead it's casting out Devils it speaks with tongues and it interprets tongues it sends forth prophecies and they happen he showed a streams interpretation this isn't a strange thing that the great leaders would say we was a bunch of crazy people when they're the leaders of the nation the leaders of the church he said see it's a marvelous thing do y'all remember a few minutes to go when Faith meets the Power meets The Promise it'll bring a manifestation and that manifestation in somebody will blind somebody else amen it'll Open the Eyes of one and blind the eyes of the other oh God and here was a boy who had been blind since he was born but all of a sudden he received his sight and the Pharisees and the Sadducees they all said this is something Beyond we can comprehend amen but the same power that opened his eyes amen blinded the other's eyes you know why because a true move of God is scriptural a true move of God is scriptural I love what the Bible says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me he said let me give you scripture first with what we do it must be scriptural it's got to be scriptural God won't honor nothing else he don't honor lies he only honors his word but he promised that my word will not return to me void now watch this and we see the word that has been allotted today now watch this no matter how much unbelief rises in the camp God will honor his word when he finds Faith to honor it by are you hearing me no matter how much unbelief rises in the camp amen God will honor his word when he finds Faith to honor his word by then in other words that boy had a heart with the faith of God in it amen for the power of God and the promise of God to be manifested and God took a little blind boy oh God he took a little blind boy and honored his word in the face of religious educated people let me just say what the Bible said Jesus answering some them go your way and tell John what things you've seen and heard how the blind see is that scriptural how the lame walk is that scripture how the lepers are cleansed is that scripture how the deaf here scriptural how the dead are raised scriptural amen are you hearing me to the poor the gospel is preached scriptural a are you are you catching this Jesus done exactly what the scripture said he would do the Bible brother Bon said the eyes of the blind would be opened here's a boy that the eyes of his body had been open and here's an entire religious movement saying it's not so we don't know where he come from are you hearing me when the very Bible said when he come the blind would see and the lame men would leap like a heart they would ought they ought to have seen amen the word was manifested but here's where I want to preach to you for a few moments on but the boy knew it because he had been there the boy knew he had been there what did he do he was in action he was ready before his boss he was ready before the priest he was ready before the counsel he was ready for anything because he had recognized God and humbled himself and went into action with this testimony that's a real servant amen that boy saw the manifested word in action and he humbled himself and he received his son come on he received his side amen and he went into action and the prophet of God said and the pillar of fire ought to put us in action today as we've seen it Vindicated the words of his promise for this hour this last day it should put the whole move of God into action when you see the pillar of Fire come on church in John N it was God and flesh amen but today the God that was in the beginning was the god that got into Jesus is the god that's here today he's not here in a Corporal body but we have scientific evidence he is here in the form of the pit of fire listen church we are not following men we are not following churches we are not following Bishops We are following the scriptural Pillar of Fire we're following the scriptural Pillar of Fire in Exodus 13: 211 the Bible said the Lord went before them by day and what a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night and a pillar of fire Amen to give them light to go by day and night and he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night now watch this from before the people he took not away the pitter of cloud by day Pillar of Fire by night from before the people now it's Wednesday I don't have time to get into it very heavy but I've been studying on it you go read Ezekiel 1 compare Ezekiel 1 to Revelation 4 and here if not the prophet is clear that the Amish yellowish light is none other than the light of God right now watch this and he he very specifically over and over brother he points out the direction it's not backward it's forward are you hearing me now when he brought the children of Israel out of the wilderness he led them by a pillar of fire is that right the Bible said he did that was the anointing the Holy Spirit Christ that went before the children of Israel well if he's the same as he was then he's the same man the same person he's everything he was then he is now and as he led the church then in the natural he's leading the church today in the spiritual remember another place Israel come through many things but it was evening time when the token was required not in the morning not in the preparation the 14 days of the keep of the Lamb Israel know amen that something was coming amen all the preparation years was only a building for the promise something is coming come on Church the first pool something's coming the second pool something's coming but watch a prophet amen so did Luther know so did Wesley know so did finny know so did Knox and Calvin know but this is it they knew there would come a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church they know there would come a time that these things would happen but they didn't live to see it but they look forward to it now watch the prophet the reformers look forward to it amen the seventh angel was not a reformer he was a prophet he was one to say we don't have to keep looking for something come on Church you got to start looking at it are you hearing me I'm I'm turning the corner now people are looking for a move of God and they're missing the move of God quit looking for the move of God and look at the move of God this is the brid's Revival this is the third pull this is the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man listen it's not coming it's here now come on y'all know I'm preaching to you right now Wednesday all day long you've been looking forward to service 7:00 service will be there 7:00 we got to be at church we got to be there we got to get there listen you know what all day long you look for it you look for it but now you're in the middle of it but if you don't change from looking for it to looking at it in a few minutes you're going to get in your car and say well I'm looking forward to church and you've done missed it but you were sitting right in it are you hearing me and that's the same way people are right here tonight you're looking for God to do something and you're right smack dab in the middle of what God is doing that's right is he Healing The Sick is he saving the Lost is he revealing his word is he keeping his word is he manifesting his word is he doing what he said he would do then quit looking for the move of God and realize you are the move of God you are the move of God now the prophet said it very beautiful he said that's some of the Mysteries that the angel is supposed to wind up all the mystery all the mysteries of God are you ready for this the pillar of fire returning back amen that's the thing that's supposed to take place I love a prophet and we see it we see it so Sister We're Not Looking for it we see it we see the pillar of fire let me ask you this how do I see it do I literally right now see a ball of fire in this room I don't but I know it's here because I see the effect of its presence on the people are you hearing me I don't have to ask you come on it's like a boy go swimming you don't have to ask the boy if he's been swimming when he gets out of the pool his clothes are soaking wet listen I'm just a country boy from East Tennessee his clothes are soaking wet he can stand there and tell you Mama I ain't been swimming I ain't been swimming but the evidence is on him that's right that he's been in the water are you hearing me and some of y'all right now are saying oh I'm looking for the supernatural but I'm looking at the evidence that the Supernatural is on you are you hearing me it's Wednesday night and you're in the house of God with your hands raised with a Heart of Thanksgiving with a voice of Praise come on that's Supernatural you've lived another day in Satan's Eden and the devil did not squash your desire to be in the house of God listen friends quit looking for it and open up your eyes and see the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel the same one that struck down Saul on this road to Damascus is the same one coming with the same power doing the same things revealing the same word staying word by word with the Bible now the pillar of fire is a changer can I tell you something else the pillar of fire is the Bible says in Exodus 14:19 and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them now watch and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them now listen he did not go behind them to lead them backwards verse 20 and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that one oh my so that one came not near the other all the night can I tell you what the prophet said he said in Redemption by power 54 he said or went up from here went up from here and stood back here he said see a go between in the time of trouble Moses that night after leading Israel out that come Pharaoh's Army but the pillar of fire went down and hung between pharaoh and pursuing Army in Israel all right church can I preach it to you now here's Israel they're coming out of Egypt listen Egypt is not behind them or in front of them rather brother Bon Egypt is behind them but the enemy said I'm going to get you same enemy said he going to get you when God delivered you from the taskmasters of your previous life so the enemy said I'll get him so the prophet said but watch he said but the pillar of fire come down and made light to Israel and darkness to pharaoh and kept him apart see a goet oh I'm so glad today he is our goet are you hearing me so here's Egypt and all of a sudden brother one they can see Israel they're pursuing Israel but all of a sudden everything around them becomes dark and they cannot see Israel they cannot see where they're going they cannot see what path they're taking do you know why because Israel was in the middle of a move of God where God was moving from Egypt into the Promised Land and so God said I'll show you a bunch of devils you'll not get my people he went and stood behind them in other words Israel went on and the pillar of fire stood between Israel the pillar of fire stood between Israel and Egypt as a goet now watch a prophet he said and today in sickness between death and life he's my goet are you ready for this he takes one he takes death in one hand and life in the other one so here's Israel in this hand and here's Egypt in this hand and Egypt saying we're going to get Israel but they cannot outrun the hand of God in other words Egypt is pushing something and they don't realize what they're pushing because everything else they could move that's right oh God I got to quit everything else they can move but here's something they cannot move they cannot move it they're trying but they cannot move it you know what happened the poet Pro of God said God LED Israel to the Red Sea he said here come Egypt right there are you hearing me and Egypt got right there on the Hills amen of Israel and said we're going to get you this time amen but God rich in Mercy through the Angry Eyes looked at the pit of fire and the Sea got re got scared and rolled back and Israel crossed on dry ground are you hearing me and now for the first time Egypt says we're going to get him we're going to get him you know what Egypt said they said if Israel can make it so can we no you can because you're not of the same Covenant it was two different covenants God's covenant was on Israel that's why right now a bunch of devils are trying to destroy him amen but Israel's tearing down things left and right you know why because they're under a covenant well I'm here I might as well preach yall know it's the truth how many agree with me God backs Israel God stands with Israel let me just say this you know what's astounding to me is you got a bunch of murderers and liars and rapist and terrorists amen do all kinds of things and don't nobody say nothing but let somebody defend thems and every devil and Hell raises up and we literally got people marching around supporting a bunch of murders and rapist well come on you know I'm preaching the truth amen and all Israel's doing is defending their own property defending their god-given right do you realize that's the same devil right now but here's what I love about it I thought I read I got a news today on the plane brother brother ju you know what it said it said Israel has got one of hamas's lead terrorists amen trapped in a tunnel are you hearing me here's a group they've been trying to destroy Israel but now here's the Israel and got their leaders trapped in a tunnel listen them guys don't play fair they go underground but I love what what Benjamin nyaho said he said your tunnels won't stop us we'll blow them to Pieces we will not cease fire until we have got the victory I said oh God that same Devil's come around are you hearing me that same Devil's built tunnels in your life and when the word of God gets to go and forth and you're ready for that breakthrough that devil takes off running in a tunnel he built and tries to hide but we're preaching a bomb of Faith we're preaching a Faith bomb and we'll drop that bomb in the house of God and blow every devil out of the tunnels until the children of God recognize who they are where they come from and where they're going he come down as a go between he made light on this side for Israel Darkness for Pharaoh are you ready for this and the same angel of God is in the church tonight giving light for the church to walk on and darkness for those who will reject it we are the children of the light what are you saying preacher I'm saying the pillar of fire moves on brother God said the pillar of fire moves on every time the pillar of fire moved the church moved with it 1958 the pillar of fire moves on and God moves with it and somebody sees it and goes on 196 one God's either going to lead the church the Holy Ghost is going to lead it or man's going to lead it if you choose man go ahead God pulls his church right out and the pillar of fire moves on and the church moves with it let me say this in closing every move of God when God moves that move becomes a latter rain to the other move he said Luther was lat rain the cathic and John Wesley latter Reign the Luther Pentecost latter Reign denomination he said now the Pentecost was organized now what's going to happen see remember the children of God drove their steak down tent so tight but where they could pull up and when the fire moved the pillar of fire they moveed with it see they move with a pillar of fire but when you get the pillar of fire doing something the Holy Spirit doing something then after that man with a message departs his life then they say they organize upon his work watch and the pillar of fire moves right out leaves him sitting there just goes right on they're so stake down till they cannot move now watch a prophet Pentecost has become so Stak down until they died first organization was Catholic died out of there come the First Reformation Luther organized and died next come Wesley organized and died next come Pentecost organized and died now watch a prophetic announcement Pentecost has died God let it die invisible Union the shuck dried up to give forth strength to the seed but there must come something that cannot be organized and die and organiz ation spells death he says so with our great Pentecostal age we're living in there's got to come forth a word of God undenominational iner outside the Realms of that denomination outside from under denominational influence I'm just going to close on this point people say you know I actually said somebody tell me one time brother the one they said you message preachers y'all preach a lot of stuff but you really don't have a bunch of scripture for Everything You Preach you know and and I'm I'm sorry but I'm not very kind of the statements like that because this is a scriptural message so just the other day I took time to sit down and prove the scriptures that speak of the move of God in the last days I'm not even giving you all of them okay I'm just going to give you a few are you ready Joshua 1 Psalms 1 Psalm 27 Daniel 11 Daniel 12 Hosea 6 Joel 2 Amos 3 habac 2 Zechariah 4 Zechariah 14 Malachi 4 Matthew 17 Mark 11 Mark 16 Luke 17 John 12 14 151 16 Acts 3 2 Corinthians Ians 3 chapter 15 1 Corinthians 1 Colossians 1 1 Thessalonians 4 Hebrews 13 Revelation 13 5 8 10 13 17 18 19 20 21 22 all speaks of a scriptural move of God in the last days and the prophet says here I believe the scripture they thoroughly identifies the great move of God in the last days of the Holy Ghost to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I believe the scripture thoroughly identifies it I don't care what anyone else thinks about it we believe that to be the truth because it's thoroughly identified what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this the same Ministry is now identified in Christ is now identified in the bride moving the bride to the manifestation I love this he said now it's got to come right straight back to that original Ministry at on Earth because it's the bride they are one right now he promised in the last days how these things would happen and we see them happening like all the promises Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 are you ready for this oh how many more Scriptures it would be endless there's endless scriptures pointing to you as the identified move of God in this age that's right brother Lan I don't think it's a coincidence brother B used the word endless because in Hebrews 7 speaks of mzc right and you know what he was he was after the order of the power of an endless life now watch MDC became Jesus Christ and MDC returns to the church in the last days to claim a body for a final move he said now when we see him return in these last days this great move of God moving across the nations of the world Gathering a people for the bride that is is the truth can I say it to you and I'm done this I'm going to say it to you like this some of you people that really believe this to be the truth we're entering another age we're entering the Rapture age you know the church cannot go in its condition it must get worse how many knows that it's got to get worse see it can't go like this he said and it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's it's it's on the move is on for the bride that's why the devil hates you is there's a people sitting here tonight under the order of MDC which is the power of an endless life let our musicians come tonight the power of an endless life now I I know we know that quot be heart move is on for the bride right that's the truth that's that's sayth the Lord but if you ever read paragraph 380 watch a prophet move up now the move is on move up now consecrated Christians so the move is on but it's calling for a move up for consecrated Christians friends I believe with all my heart tonight that there's a bride sitting here who's been anointed by the MDC anointing to break the sound barrier you want to see a move of God open your eyes you are a move of God people say I want to see a miracle open your eyes you are a miracle people say I I want to see something Supernatural open your eyes you see what this message did it come to open our eyes can I say it to you like this the message didn't put it there it was already there the message only changed your scene the message changed your scene to see what was already there y'all remember Gaza and Elisha he came in there and he told Gesa or Elisha he said Elisha we're surrounded he said Gesa we're surrounded he said yeah we're surrounded he said well let's go out there he he said we're surrounded so he went out there and he looked and there was all the there was all the enemies and there was everything I've often I've often kind of thought maybe like this you know maybe Gaza was in there in the morning maybe he was drinking his morning coffee or something you know or Elisha rather he was in there maybe getting ready and just sitting there SI sipping on a cup of coffee or tea or whatever you know and then come running Gaz he said oh oh Elisha we're surrounded we're surrounded come out here and look you know and Elisha got up and maybe walked out there you know and he opened the door and he looked up and he said yeah yeah yeah went back in sit down you know Gesa came in there all tore up brother one he said Elisha Elisha didn't you see it he said oh yeah I seen it he said but there's more with us there's more with us than there is with him God open this boy's eyes and let him see there's more with us that's right there's more with us than there is with him Elisha by the word changed gesus see and he began to see beyond what he was seeing now come on church I can prove it to you by the Bible the Bible says we've come to Mount Zion right to the innumerable amount of angels come on Church you know what the prophet said he said like this he said out of the river of Euphrates has been released 200,000,000 demons against the bride brother one right here tonight we can count 200,000,000 demons that's been loosed against the bride out of the river Euphrates we can number the Devils against us brother Ariel we can number the Devils against us we can number the Devils against us but the Bible says we've come to Z where there's an innumerable amount of angels so in other words we can number the Devils against us but we cannot number the Angels that's for us hallelujah we can number the Devils against us but we cannot number the Angels that's with us hallelujah I believe it's real tonight friends won't you stand to your feet with us I believe the move is on for the bride how many agree with me the move the move move the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the Lord that's Vindicated word spoken over the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not going backward we're not going to the left we're not going to the right we're going forward we're under the eagle anointing we're going forward Heavenly Father Lord all AC Ross this building tonight Lord as Eagles father I believe your word is here tonight in power I believe it's here in reality Lord I believe that your anointing the spirit of God has moved across this congregation tonight father I believe Liberty has come into hearts and lives father I believe your anointed word has been spoken over the hearts of your children now father you see these things you laid up my heart I pray some way somehow that Lord the pre where the Holy Spirit could find a crack in the crevice of the heart of every believer and Lord there the power of God could begin to leak into that heart it can begin to drop in that heart and Lord as the power of God drops in that heart sin has to be pushed away sickness has to flee discouragement has to give way to encouragement bondage has to give way to Liberty confusion has to give way to peace defeat has to give way to Victory Satan I adure Thee in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I command you to take your hands off of God's Property I command you to lose him tonight in the name of Jesus and receive the move of god father I pray the same anointing that raised my Lord from the dead would leak into every heart here tonight and manifest resurrection power in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ father give breakthroughs Lord take them beyond the barriers father take them beyond the sound barrier take them beyond the unbelief barrier take them beyond the doubt barrier break every barrier tonight in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ how many raise your hand tonight and say Lord Lord break every barrier I'm ready to break every barrier I'm ready to break through the barrier of doubt I'm ready to break through the barrier of fear I'm ready to break through the barrier of unbelief I'm ready to break that barrier I'm ready to take that barrier and stand on it as a platform Hallelujah I'm ready to take that condemnation that hangs over my head put it on the ground and stand on it use it as a platform in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ I feel the spirit of the Lord here tonight just leading my heart to this over and over when brother Bram talked about the barrier he called it a sound barrier and one place you say you got to break your own sound your own sound barrier see maybe the sound barrier for the church as a whole is different than your sound
