TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] for a Rapture be two bed one will be taken one left right two will be in the in the automobile seat and one will be taken the other be left yes it's going to happen in a moment you said brother random when will it be you might criticize this if it's all right to say let me drop a little something here one day you're going to find out you're going to say there oh I've been taught that there's this that and the other going to happen before the Lord comes there'll be a Great Tribulation period and we'll go through it you know one time Jesus was asked a question he said why does the scribes say that Elias must first come Jesus said I say unto you he's already come and you didn't know it one of these days you're going to say well I thought the church was going had to do this that and the other I thought there'd be a Rapture I thought See it'll be a secret catching away amen if you tuck one here at Hot Springs and one somewhere else and one down there and one there will make up literally millions of those that come up out of the ground and there's at least 500 people every day missing the world and we don't even know where they went to see the raptures going to make up of all those who sleep in the dust of the earth that's right with God they'll say well I thought a raptures take place that's already passed and you knew it not you're left well everything's going yes sir it's a secret coming the Rapture is comes to steal away like that book I read that time of what was it Juliet and Romeo he come at night time when the people were sleeping in worldliness and the church all in worldl and all of a sudden the cry come and away they went listen you've heard so much of the Christian business man the Full Gospel man saying oh you know Reverend Holy Father so and so the Presbyterians are beginning to receive the Holy Ghost the lutherans are beginning to receive the Holy Ghost you sleeping bunch of people don't you know Jesus said when a sleeping virgin come to by or it was that very time that the brro come remember they did not get it is that right right as Booth clber said huh they might went through some emotions but they really didn't get it when they come to buy o it was too late [Music] and here they are now the Presbyterian the Lutheran look at that little gospel business man's voice and that bunch of Pentecostal grandchildren with these denominational Brethren thinking that that's something great you might ask somebody well I thought this it's already passed and you knew it not right let me stop there because I I'm not here to preach Doctrine but the possibilities don't you take that chance this is the day this is the hour there's a possibility right now maybe not at 5:00 there's a possibility Lord I know you're God I know you are I'm away from you but I know that these fibers of mine once Buzz with the power of God I know the things that I care for today I claim to be Pentecostal the women I cut my hair the man I do this that or the other and you man that'll let your wives wear them shorts and do them things and that call yourself a Son of God shame on you I went to a certain great denominational church not long ago till they had a meeting and I went out to Vis him and the pastor take me out and he was going to introduce me to his wife she was a Pianist and that woman had on a dress so tight that the skin was almost on the outside she had makeup on and all kinds of things in her ears and I said brother do you mean to say that your your wife is a saint said yes sir I said she looks like a Han I said I never seen such in the name of Pentecost and Holiness oh brother we need a house cleaning from the P pit to the basement [Applause] [Music] one of these days you say I'm Pentecostal that don't mean no more than being a pig to God that has nothing to do with Christ that's just the name you got to be Pentecost in your heart the fruits of the spirit notice Oh my he was aware what would happen if God answered his prayer are you aware are you aware that organization going to excommunicate you or do you realize you're going right out of the Federation of churches and things that you're going right into do you realize what it's going to cost you you know that women you play cards with going to call you oldfashioned and all that kind of stuff because you won't let your children wear shorts and you're doing these things you know what's going to cost you better count it before you start you better think about it yeah you better you better talk it over with God first before you make the start he know if his prayer was answered but he was ready and he was sincere if the church can only get in that condition if you're ready right now if you're sincere if you really mean business if your eyes are open to what I'm trying to tell you around about W right if you're sincere then say Lord I don't care what it is I'm ready I see the sign I know that's later than we think it's time to come then Samson Cried Out Lord they poke my eyes out I know that you're a God I know that you have power to do it I know you can set me free from these pets just once more Lord just once more just once more Lord more let there be a camp meeting on a side of a hill like there was on the hill at The Upper Room yes let there come a sound from heaven like a rushing my wind fill all the house visable evidence of the resurrected Christ just once more Lord just once more he cried as he cried out in sincerity standing there in his blinded eye I know the price Lord but just once more the god answers prayer he felt the fibers tightening his muscles begin to take holdu his leg straight begin to come back he said to the little boy lead me to the Post [Applause] now Lead Me Lord lead me lead me to the post the calvary lead me to the Post where I can be crucified my old worldly life dies out here and all that I am lead me to the Post Lo Hallelujah when you begin to feel them muscles tighten with the power of God he didn't have to see what was taking place he felt what was taking [Music] place he began to twist his shoulders and what he did down with the building that day he conquered he killed more Philistines than he did all the days of his life friends there a possibility that this church in the state I got about three or four pages of notes there we'll let go there's a possibility there's a possibility right here in this camp meeting there's a possibility right here at this hour there's a possibility if we're ready to pay the price we can see another AE come take place once more Lord we've messed it up we've organized we broke up our Brotherhood we separated our fellowship we Tu a little group over here we're fighting with one another and the devil sit back washes whip one another down lord is it possible that once more that all 120 of us can be in one Accord place is it possible there come a sound from Heaven as a Russian Mighty win once more Lord once more let's stand to our feet and say once more Lord once more Lord Oh Lord God hear me Lord me Hallelujah once more Lord once more send the spirit up on this GL the oh [Music] [Music]
