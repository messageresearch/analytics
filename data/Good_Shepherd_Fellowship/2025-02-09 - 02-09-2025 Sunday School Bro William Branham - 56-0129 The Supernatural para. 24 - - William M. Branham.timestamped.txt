[3:18] in the Assembly of God Church amongst
[3:21] Pentecostal people now I've learned to
[3:24] love the Pentecostal people they're my
[3:27] brothers and sisters but many times find
[3:30] in our own race of Pentecost that
[3:33] sometimes our atmosphere becomes an
[3:35] emotion instead of a
[3:37] worship and that soon dies out and the
[3:40] members become one thing and another but
[3:42] if we could ever get a group of people
[3:44] together what would jel wine Holy Spirit
[3:47] atmosphere of sacredness and sincerity
[3:51] and
[3:52] worship and the men and women sitting in
[3:55] there are God conscious and know that
[3:58] the great omnipotence of God God is
[4:01] present ready to do all things without
[4:03] one Shadow of Doubt they even have an
[4:07] effect upon the unbelievers that's
[4:08] setting in their
[4:09] seat you can never come into that
[4:12] atmosphere without something
[4:15] happening I was preached here not long
[4:18] ago the tape recorders here the boys was
[4:20] with me they took a sermon on the hidden
[4:22] Life of Christ how to get into Christ
[4:24] and how that some people has ups and
[4:27] downs you can't there's a place you have
[4:29] to find
[4:31] the outer courts produce Mana sure many
[4:33] people are living right in that Mana
[4:35] they eat in the Mana but they don't live
[4:38] the right kind of a life they're up and
[4:40] down they have ins and outs and bad days
[4:43] and good days but you've met people that
[4:45] absolutely don't matter what the weather
[4:47] was or what the conditions was they're
[4:49] on our Housetop all the
[4:51] time he found that secret he's found an
[4:55] atmosphere to live in in the Old
[4:57] Testament how that the congregation was
[4:59] F from bread out of Heaven they live in
[5:01] three different atmospheres in the court
[5:04] in the of the manif and the Israelites
[5:07] eat Mana he eat the same Mana that did
[5:10] in every other place same Mana but
[5:14] remember that inside the courts in the
[5:16] ark was a place fixed where the the man
[5:19] never did get old elwi it got old it
[5:23] wouldn't last till 9:00 in the morning
[5:24] if you didn't grind it up into meal and
[5:26] make some cakes out of and eat it and we
[5:29] find out before the sun went down they
[5:30] were hungry if they didn't gather enough
[5:33] and that's what matter the people today
[5:35] they got the campground
[5:38] cramps they go to a Revival and have a
[5:41] great time the first thing you know a
[5:43] little after that before another revival
[5:45] can come along they're back in the world
[5:47] again a certain man wrote an article
[5:50] about me not long ago which perfectly
[5:52] all right I love him don't say that to
[5:55] be a hypocrite I said it because it's
[5:57] the truth John Church you Nazarene
[6:00] people
[6:02] man he said it wrote against Divine
[6:05] Healing he said one of their key man Mr
[6:08] brand said I've never met the man in my
[6:11] life and to think of a sensible man
[6:13] writing an article about a person he had
[6:15] never spoke to in his life that shows me
[6:18] something
[6:19] wrong our law says how can we judge a
[6:22] man without we hear him
[6:24] first he said I don't know a man never
[6:27] heard never seen him in my life but a a
[6:29] man come to me and told me that he was
[6:31] setting he wanted me to pray for him
[6:33] that he'd be healed of a prostrate
[6:35] trouble and he said I was heal one and
[6:38] said he told me the story he said I was
[6:40] sitting in a
[6:42] meeting and said uh way back in a
[6:45] balcony and said it's Mr brandom's
[6:47] meeting and said all at once I begin to
[6:50] feel a strange feeling come over me and
[6:52] said then the man turned around from
[6:54] where he was preaching and said the man
[6:56] sitting up there is so and so a certain
[6:58] man from a certain place and said he's
[7:00] praying that he'll be healed of a
[7:02] prostrate
[7:03] trouble and said if he'll only accept it
[7:06] and believe it now he can go home and be
[7:08] well he said something struck me I'll
[7:10] Never Felt anything like it in my
[7:13] life he said and for a solid Year my
[7:16] prostrates never bother me and he come
[7:18] on me again Mr Church said that don't
[7:20] you see that shows that Mr Brandon is
[7:22] fault if God healed a man he'd heal him
[7:25] for life I thought Mr Church how many
[7:28] times you come up on the silver Hills
[7:29] Campground and get all those nazarin
[7:31] Sanctified this year next year you
[7:33] sanctify another bunch of them maybe
[7:35] didn't have it to begin with then God
[7:36] wouldn't be real
[7:39] see Divine Healing and sanctification
[7:43] and the powers of God is as long as your
[7:46] faith lasts in it when your faith fails
[7:48] then your experience is
[7:50] gone it's faith that way simply upon the
[7:54] finished works of Christ the
[7:57] calvary you're Sanctified is as long as
[7:59] your testimony is right as long as you
[8:01] live a Sanctified life and believe that
[8:03] God sanctifies you you're
[8:06] Sanctified count it all to his grace and
[8:08] his Merit and as long as you can accept
[8:11] healing and believe your healing and and
[8:13] goow on believe it like that you'll be
[8:15] healed as long as you believe it and you
[8:16] start doubting it and you take a a man
[8:19] setting here this morning it's not a bit
[8:20] sick and let him begin to get in his
[8:22] heart believing he is sick they'll pack
[8:23] him out of the
[8:26] building as your faith is
[8:30] so be it unto you that's not Christian
[8:33] Science I'm not meaning mind over
[8:36] matter but you see the thing of it is is
[8:39] the atmosphere that you live in now this
[8:41] man that we're going to speak of for
[8:44] just a few moments then I want to give
[8:45] you a
[8:46] testimony this man Elijah the great
[8:50] prophet was a man who lived in that
[8:53] constant
[8:55] atmosphere he was a car man of Nazarite
[8:59] birth
[9:00] all gifts and callings are without
[9:03] repentance it's nothing you can't make
[9:05] one hair black or white you can't add
[9:07] one pupic to your
[9:09] statue we only have carnal impersonation
[9:13] when we try to impersonate something
[9:15] that God hasn't made us if we try to do
[9:18] something that God hasn't called us to
[9:20] do we'll be a total failure in doing
[9:24] it if man would try to make himself
[9:27] woman woman man how would you do it
[9:30] I met that woman that was they supposed
[9:32] to have the surgical test and be made or
[9:34] manm made a woman whatever it was and
[9:37] Italy and Rome that she was a disgrace
[9:41] to being a woman drunk as she could be
[9:44] walking up and down the street or a
[9:46] harvest site you ever seen
[9:50] notice you can't make yourself anything
[9:52] different from what God intended you to
[9:54] be anything else is an impersonation
[9:56] therefore if your conversion is on
[9:58] because you're trying to hide behind
[10:00] something or trying to make yourself a
[10:02] better person you're only playing the
[10:04] part of a
[10:05] hypocrite until Christ has actually come
[10:08] to your life and changed you and brought
[10:10] you into an atmosphere that's the
[10:13] different that's the reason we go
[10:15] through so many different forms and
[10:16] saying they have to do this Jesus said
[10:18] he that Hearth my word and believeth on
[10:20] him and sent me has everlasting
[10:22] life not a make belief it's absolutely
[10:25] something that's
[10:26] happened and in conversion of the heart
[10:29] that changed you and brought you into
[10:30] another
[10:31] realm men are misunderstood Christian
[10:34] women men boys and girls are
[10:36] misunderstood who live in those places
[10:38] because it's contrary to the Natural run
[10:40] of life among people of the
[10:43] world I'm sure we all want to live in
[10:46] that atmosphere look the people who eat
[10:48] the Mana out here on the ground was
[10:50] eaten the same Mana that the high priest
[10:52] eat in under the shakina glory but this
[10:56] Mana withered away out on the ground but
[10:58] that in the hi place never did wither a
[11:01] away it lasted through the spans of
[11:05] years and a man who walked in there and
[11:09] the high priest went in beyond that Veil
[11:11] that Veil that separated the Hol from
[11:14] the holiest of holies when he walked in
[11:16] there the veil dropped behind him that
[11:18] man he it was even
[11:21] soundproof he didn't he shut off from
[11:23] all the world and the
[11:25] surroundings he know nothing in there
[11:28] but the living in the presence of God
[11:31] and a man or a woman that ever walked
[11:33] into that CH kind of Glory of God the
[11:35] whole world shut off behind
[11:37] him no matter what the devil says you
[11:40] don't pay any attention to it and he's
[11:43] living in a different her atmosphere he
[11:45] lived in there where they put Aaron's
[11:47] rod and it was nothing but an old Dead
[11:50] stick off of an olive tree but once laid
[11:52] in the presence of God it yielded what
[11:55] it was supposed to be in the beginning
[11:58] and one night time blooded blossomed and
[12:00] brought arm that's the same way that an
[12:03] unbeliever a sinner is ever laid in the
[12:05] presence of almighty God or the
[12:07] influence of the Holy
[12:09] Spirit he becomes a new creature right
[12:11] then his life becomes fruitful Fresh
[12:14] Life comes in and he yields what he was
[12:18] supposed to be a Son of
[12:20] God we were tuck off of the tree so was
[12:23] that Olive bran he would talk off of the
[12:26] tree about Sinners and and lukewarm
[12:28] Church become dry
[12:31] sck with some kind of a memory that
[12:34] sometime there was a supernatural of God
[12:36] in the past they had life and way back
[12:38] there but if you believe and lay in his
[12:40] presence it'll produce the same thing to
[12:44] you you will realize that you were born
[12:47] Sons and Daughters of God and will yield
[12:49] the fruit of the
[12:51] spirit but you can't do it out there in
[12:53] the court you got to do it in here on
[12:56] the inside hit away
[13:00] the man out the course he walked by
[13:02] daylight some days it was like this rain
[13:05] other days it was sun and Shine the
[13:07] night time it be dark and stormy he had
[13:10] is ups and downs that's the way you see
[13:11] people oh they say we're eating the good
[13:13] man of God that's
[13:16] right but where are they living they're
[13:19] living out there eating it in an
[13:21] atmosphere that they should not eat it
[13:22] in the next man he had another light as
[13:25] the mat the all it was lit by seven
[13:28] golden candles take some little lamps
[13:31] and sometimes them lamps burnt low and
[13:33] they smoked up the chimneys you know how
[13:36] it lamp does smokes and goes out and a
[13:39] man who comes to the place where he
[13:40] comes into the church out of the courts
[13:43] out of a just a lukewarm church member
[13:45] and comes up to live a pretty good life
[13:47] in Christ he separates things but he's
[13:50] still living under lights that will get
[13:52] demm and smoke up and artificial
[13:56] life but when he once walked in behind
[13:59] that holiest of
[14:00] holies walks into the presence of God
[14:03] and the veil falls behind him there's a
[14:06] pot Mana where he can eat every day
[14:09] every hour of the
[14:10] week that's where he's living in the
[14:13] Shina Glory where in the inlock wings of
[14:15] the Turan the great Pillar of Fire in
[14:18] the China rested there and he's living
[14:20] under there he can't be nothing but a
[14:23] real January Christian
[14:25] anytime atmosphere
[14:30] many and women who live in there are
[14:32] misunderstood you see it they become
[14:36] peculiar they don't hear the things of
[14:38] the world if they do they don't pay
[14:39] attention to it they just move
[14:43] on God never put that in there for
[14:46] nothing God never come for just any
[14:48] halfhazard
[14:49] way prayer is not a uh perhaps prayer is
[14:54] a sincere
[14:56] thing prayer is talking to God pray is
[15:00] not get down shut your eyes and think
[15:02] about your washing or your work you're
[15:04] doing and say Lord help me and John he
[15:06] Miss Jones and so well that's not
[15:08] prayer that's repeating some words the
[15:12] prayer is to come into an
[15:15] atmosphere where you realize that you're
[15:17] in the presence of
[15:19] God and you're moving to them in the
[15:23] deepest of
[15:24] sincerity first is the worship oh
[15:29] Jehovah how I love you is it it then
[15:33] after the worship of prayer then you
[15:36] come with the sincere heart asking if ye
[15:40] abide in
[15:42] me not go out behind the curtains in the
[15:45] world today and run around try to get
[15:46] back in the curtains
[15:47] tonight if ye abide in me my words abide
[15:53] in you otherwise if you're like Aaron's
[15:57] rock that's pulled up to the kind of
[15:59] Glory by the golden pot of Mana where
[16:02] you can eat at any time and your soul is
[16:04] refreshed and blooming and
[16:07] yeling
[16:09] abide if you abide in me my words abide
[16:14] in you then ask what you will it'll be
[16:17] given to you to see your failures of the
[16:21] church the Pentecostal Church the
[16:23] Methodist the Baptist and all it's a
[16:26] failing to that abiding grace of
[16:30] God so night you'll shou and clap your
[16:33] hands and dance in the AIS speaking
[16:36] tongues that's
[16:38] gift gift is no good unless you're
[16:40] abiding in the sh
[16:43] Glory those things are fine I have
[16:45] nothing to say against them they of God
[16:47] shouting and blessing God wonderful
[16:49] speaking in tongues or translation of
[16:52] tongues or I mean interpretation the
[16:54] tong it's the same but uh and all these
[16:57] other things Gifts of healing prophecies
[17:00] all these things are marvelous but
[17:03] they're no good they're not fruitful
[17:05] they can't
[17:07] yield the right unless you're living in
[17:10] the presence of the
[17:12] Shan the atmosphere around is Godly
[17:17] that's the reason that men and women are
[17:18] not permitted to these
[17:20] things because you'd go out here and
[17:22] call a blessing over something God had
[17:24] cursed or or curse something God had
[17:26] blessed
[17:29] it's an abiding presence to know the
[17:33] will of God then don't look what the
[17:35] world's going to say about it's what God
[17:37] thinks about you then you're living in
[17:40] his
[17:41] presence in the days of this prophecy a
[17:45] prophet rather God has never been
[17:48] without a voice or a mouthpiece
[17:50] somewhere on the
[17:52] earth and Elijah was his
[17:55] mouthy and as far as I know during the
[17:57] time of the backsliding of Israel they
[18:00] always got cold and farmer and backslid
[18:03] because it goes to show Friends that
[18:05] yeah we have no continu in
[18:08] city but we're seeking one to
[18:13] come not long go I stood look I used to
[18:17] be at Pug as you know
[18:19] fights I won 15 professional fights not
[18:23] bragging I'm ashamed of it but 15
[18:27] professional fights through out losing
[18:28] single one nine of them
[18:31] Knockouts I had my picture there when I
[18:33] in my very best muscles over me and
[18:37] black shaggy hair hanging around my neck
[18:40] and I looked and I thought my little
[18:42] girl come in and see my picture sitting
[18:44] in the room she said daddy you don't
[18:46] look like you used to sure
[18:49] not oh yeah we have no continuing
[18:53] City this Mortal body is fading away
[18:57] where used to be strong old age fat
[19:00] begins to slip
[19:01] in I once remember of a great tree that
[19:05] he used to stand by his great shirtly
[19:08] branches I said it'll live forever and
[19:11] today it's a
[19:14] snag I stood not long ago in Rome where
[19:19] once rule the
[19:20] world and there that great
[19:24] city has now become nothing but you'd
[19:27] have to dig 30 ft feet under the Earth
[19:29] to find the ruins of it now one of the
[19:32] weakest degraded nations in the world
[19:35] and not even
[19:37] self-supporting I stood in Athens Greece
[19:41] where another great Empire once
[19:43] stood and there's not even hardly a
[19:46] symbol of that Empire
[19:49] left I stood in the Cairo Egypt where
[19:53] Egypt once known and rule the world and
[19:56] the St of pharaoh and there nothing l
[19:58] but the sinks and a few of the pyramides
[20:01] spanding as relic of the once great
[20:04] worldwide
[20:06] Empire brother and
[20:08] sister our Great America and our great
[20:11] economy that we have is
[20:13] rottening one of the foundations and
[20:17] Someday My Feet in the making right now
[20:20] shall lay in the
[20:23] ruins and you young men today you young
[20:26] women what's the beauty youth the bless
[20:30] of the young
[20:31] sheep the Folly of the young heart but
[20:35] one
[20:36] day will mold Y in a graveyard
[20:40] somewhere why because all Mortal has to
[20:44] give away to
[20:45] immortality every nation has to fall
[20:49] because there's coming a
[20:50] nation that will not be rule by
[20:54] man but by Christ
[20:59] these things fall Israel
[21:01] fell and it fall or just before it fall
[21:05] this great T great prophet raise which
[21:08] was a
[21:10] fanatic among the people but he lived in
[21:14] an atmosphere that he was constantly in
[21:16] the presence of
[21:19] God and he served God away to himself
[21:23] almost like an
[21:27] isolationist and I can imagine the
[21:29] people talking about him I can imagine
[21:31] saying you believe that story about the
[21:33] bird seeding him up there you believe
[21:35] all these different things in the days
[21:37] of Noah you believe the rain Story how
[21:39] it's going to come water down out of
[21:41] that
[21:42] fanatic but he lived enter the
[21:45] atmospheres of God and not of
[21:49] man and then when it come time there was
[21:52] a the syrians came over and took a
[21:55] little girl over into their nation and
[21:58] the great Chief captain of the army the
[22:01] Bible said he was a mighty man but he
[22:03] was a
[22:06] laer out in these this world today right
[22:09] here in Owensboro
[22:11] Kentucky there's man of great influence
[22:14] in your city
[22:16] here I do not know them but a city of
[22:19] this science could not yield hardly
[22:21] unless it would be a modern Sodom
[22:23] without having man of
[22:25] influence but it depends on where they
[22:27] let this influence dwell at what kind of
[22:31] life it produces if it's under politics
[22:33] which I can't say anything about him we
[22:35] need politics and so forth but whatever
[22:37] he is if he lets his of this influence
[22:40] lay in the right
[22:43] atmosphere you are to lay in the
[22:45] presence of
[22:47] God notice this na was a great fellow
[22:50] but he was a
[22:51] Le there's so many people today even I'm
[22:54] sad to say but even in the
[22:56] pit this great man but listens to man's
[23:00] theology instead of staying in the
[23:01] presence of God and still a leper having
[23:04] a form of godliness but denying the
[23:06] power thereof influential speaker
[23:10] forceful but still never knows what it
[23:13] is to be born again the AR of believe in
[23:15] the Supernatural and
[23:18] cannot understand it and except they
[23:20] come into the kingdom of God you'll
[23:23] explain it way through reasonings every
[23:25] time or he's never lived in this
[23:27] atmosphere but a man ever comes Mar he
[23:30] has to become a son and daughter of God
[23:31] and his nature is like
[23:33] God who believes the
[23:37] supernatural so they had a little girl
[23:39] there and I want to show you the force
[23:42] of the testimony of a
[23:44] child who lived in a
[23:47] nation or perhaps a family who was under
[23:51] the
[23:52] influence of
[23:54] God she loved her master and her mes so
[24:00] when she seen Nam probably a
[24:02] good-hearted good-natured man as far as
[24:05] we know according the history Elijah had
[24:07] never healed a man with
[24:09] Leprosy there had never been a lepr case
[24:11] heal in his
[24:13] days but the little girl being raised
[24:17] and brought up under the influence over
[24:20] in Israel get an
[24:22] alien she was conducting herself as a
[24:26] believer
[24:30] and that's the way we should do all the
[24:32] time is conduct ourselves no matter what
[24:36] our position is conduct ourselves as
[24:40] Believers ready at all times to give an
[24:43] answer for the hope that lies within you
[24:47] you see
[24:48] it here's some kind of
[24:50] go down in the
[24:53] South the Germans or the Dutch brought
[24:56] over the Dutch colonies over to America
[25:00] Negroes Out of Africa and sold them in
[25:04] the southern states for slav and they
[25:07] become personal property to the slave
[25:10] owner and they work at the calls of the
[25:14] days and their cars over them from whips
[25:18] and sometimes unkind
[25:21] Masters and they were burdened and away
[25:24] from home many times they wouldn't want
[25:26] to work and they would make them and
[25:29] force them to work and on a certain
[25:32] Plantation there was a great owner who
[25:34] owned many hundreds slaves two or 300
[25:38] slaves on this great Plantation you buy
[25:42] St
[25:44] slaves and one day a buyer came
[25:47] by he said I would like to buy from you
[25:51] that certain
[25:52] slave that I watched him in his conduct
[25:56] so he walked straight
[25:58] you never have to whip him said he's
[26:01] always willing and standing ready to do
[26:04] anything he said he seems to be such a
[26:07] gallant person said perhaps you've made
[26:10] him the boss over the rest of him he
[26:13] said no he's just a
[26:15] slave said maybe you feed him a little
[26:18] better what makes him act different so
[26:20] no he eats with the rest of them so what
[26:24] makes him act different here it is Breen
[26:29] so no I wondered myself what made him
[26:32] always with his chin up test out ready
[26:35] any time never dropy never
[26:39] moping but I learned that he is the son
[26:44] of the king of the tribe though he's a
[26:48] alen though he's away from home still he
[26:52] conducts himself knowing this that he's
[26:55] the son of the king
[27:01] he keeps the morale the L of him
[27:03] high for he knows he's a
[27:08] son how much that ought to be to the
[27:10] Christian church this morning and while
[27:12] tell
[27:13] them no matter what other man do and
[27:15] what those do profess Christi does we
[27:18] must walk as Sons and Daughters of the
[27:21] king our morale should be
[27:24] wonderful we should never act as the
[27:27] world or live with the world we should
[27:30] keep our courage High knowing this that
[27:32] we are
[27:33] aliens we don't care about the world and
[27:36] what they think we are aliens pilgrims
[27:39] and
[27:40] strangers but someday we're going home
