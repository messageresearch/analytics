again go to be in the house of the Lord Hallelujah before we get to uh I'm breaking the word this morning and just like we said we were able to make a a quick trip to be able to help a situation there with a local church and and that's where we we started from years back where we gave our heart to the Lord it was uh uh very somehow emotional uh because not emotional uh you know in a bad way but emotional in a good sense thank you musicians I will get from your right to the word and that I also want to thank the Deacons uh and the trustees Brother Dan Brother uh Jordy uh those uh were wonderful Services we were able to follow some of the meetings while we were away praise the Lord and uh [Music] I remember you know uh when we started thinking about going back there were some things I was praying about thinking on and then uh it was few days after my birthday when I got saved so going back around the very same time brought a lot of lot of memories to me and going at the same time and going back to the same places yeah it brought a lot of membranes to me so it was a time of rededication for me also it was a time of rededication for Mina I was thinking about walking on the same street knowing the very same spot where the Lord there with my heart so it was a time of rededication I don't know what it means but I'm just placing myself in the hands of the Lord amen yeah that's that's what the trip meant to me more than anything else praise the Lord I told the church the last service I have I said if I get if I if we go back and you'll bring this church down I will have no regret of coming we have no regret of coming but we thank the Lord the Lord granted us a tremendous Victory we saw the people splitted into manufaction but we were able to to work with them talk with the officers and and we have we have a process in place to be able to help the healing of the church brother some Year from Nigeria he's an associate pastor to Pastor Martins that have been with us here a few times he's there he flew into the country Thursday to help the church but the deli would be going back on the 4th of November and now of which time we are hoping that the process that we put in place will be will be all wrapped up and then the church can be able to move them in whichever way to choose but we thank the Lord amen we thank the Lord praise the Lord and be back bring greetings from Brother Elijah and his and his family they were the one that hosted us uh they hosted us and and during the time we were there the uh very large us also thought that he he will get a benefit of the of the ministers in his house so he set up a three days meetings in his church so we're having three days Revival yet and then from there we go to Five wall on the other side uh we go to solve problem not fight War but uh it was it was it was wonderful so we had a we had a good good time and uh um we just want to thank the Lord amen so while we were away the uh [Music] we had a three days meeting brother daily preach on Monday because he was flying back to Nigeria on Tuesday he had another meeting waiting for him on the weekend so I preached it on Tuesday because I was going to preach at the church where we were helping on Wednesday and then our brother Simon Peter preach on Wednesday and uh since it was his former church he was going to spend the weekend with them so then Sunday I had to come back to brother Elijah's Church so I was actually thinking of uh all along what am I going to preach here but I think it was a it was a wonderful thing and a good choice that brought a Elijah did because the meetings kind of brought a sense of Revival to his church so then I told her I said well okay I will close since I'm coming after the three days meeting I will speak on just something to kind of uplift the church so I spoke on the message the shout of the king is in the camp something that we have spoke here before but I'm going back to it this morning and because there were things that by the grace of God we we brought uh uh with with some with some pictures and to bring a picture a kind of a scene to to the subject so I thought well I mean uh this is not I mean it's like a brother Aaron called me and he told he said he said brother one you have preached his message back but you didn't preach it like the way you preach it down there and it looks like you were more it looks like when you go out you preach different than when you preach home I said well I don't know but uh uh so this morning I want to go back to that that's what I want to speak on this morning I want to talk about the shout of the king in the camp and we want to talk about the church and the leadership of the church we want to talk about uh how the Church of the Living God is is a mystical body and the church is now owned by any man the church is owned by Jesus Christ praise the Lord and if we miss the leadership of the church and put ourselves under the leadership of man we are going to get into trouble that's the reason why we want to make sure that we stay under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh and and now there are sometimes there are things there are people you know we we we are dealing with with humans you know brothers and sisters you know uh elderly and younger ones but we also have to be careful that's the reason why the church is the most precious thing that God have on Earth praise the Lord because he used his own blood amen he used his own blood to purchase the church so the Church of the Lord Jesus is the most precious thing that God have and that is the reason why we we have to be careful because Us in the church you will not have an angel as your pastor you will have a human you will not have an angel sitting down beside you you will have a human and uh and and and we are now all from the same tribe or from the same you know background God brings his people from different places but yet uh there is there is that's the reason why the scripture says that by one Spirit First Corinthians 12 13 by one Spirit we are baptized into one body praise the Lord and that's the birth of the church that's what makes the church a mystical body praise the Lord amen as long as we are humans together there will always be a flaw because of their sticky sin nature that we are born honored so you know you have somebody like to chew their their fingernails you don't like to chew their fingernails and you know and another person that you know have a nature of picking in their nose you don't like it to you to pick in your nose and and you know and and all of these different things you know I'm just saying that to kind of forgive you a picture of the different things that we would deal with so if if our mind of the church is to be able to to create a national Spirit or Creator you know uh a brain I was served by the way we dress or bring ourselves by the way we talk and then pretty soon we are we are starting a cult amen praise the Lord when the Bible talks about the beauty of the Lord the beauty of Holiness the beauty of Holiness is how much God has distributed his grace in each of his children and then when we come together and bring that grace of God together that is the beauty of Holiness amen that in Falling men and falling women almighty God can still raise us from the dust he can raise us from our failure and bring us from our past and still make something out of our life that is the beauty of holiness praise the Lord so this morning we want to talk about on the the shout of the king in the camp let's go quickly to normal chapter 23. the Lord bless you you stand as we read reading from verse 16 numbers 23 reading from verse 16. I was very very emotional when I was preaching uh uh last Sunday very emotional we I had a lot of noise in the room because I was allowing the people to shout and shout and Shout I'm not going to do that this morning amen unless you want to do it amen but Elijah have they have a big building so the echo was growing all over the place amen Numbers chapter 16 or 23 sorry verse 16 Numbers Chapter 23 verse 16. and then now these are some of the things that people don't understand uh you know uh uh if a person wants to use their kind of mind to understand the church you know or Paul say it does not work but let's read it the Lord met billum and put a word in his mouth and say go again unto valak and say thus and when he came to him behold he stood by his burn offering and the princes of Moab with him in balak said unto him what have the Lord spoken and he took up a parable and said rise up balak and yield taking on to me thou Son of zeppel God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent have he said and shall he not do it or have he spoken and Shah he not make it good behold I have received commandment to bless and he have blessed and I cannot reverse it praise the Lord I have received commandment to bless and he have blessed and I cannot reverse it he hath not be held iniquity in Jacob neither have he seen perverseness in Israel the Lord his God is with him and the shout of the king is a Monday praise the Lord let us pray together heavenly father almighty God we we're so glad to be back home Lord Jesus father Lord we want to thank you for uh this assembly Lord God we go to different places we have the privilege of god father to speak sometimes but Lord is different when we are home it's a place where Godfather where we are fully identified with and the people that we identify with people that you are giving of Grace Lord God that we can grow together as we wait on the coming of the Lord so we just want to ask your blessing this morning now father the point your word can't break the word to our hearts in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat the shout of the king is among them amen praise the Lord you believe that the shadow of the king is here this morning do you believe that the shout of the king is here this morning amen praise the Lord is too quiet for a shout [Laughter] praise the lord it's too quiet for a shout you believe that a shout of the king is here this morning [Music] foreign amen [Music] the shout is in the silence praise the Lord they shout to see the silence amen because it took the silence it took the breaking of the seals for the shout to come out for us to know what the shout is so the shout is in the silence amen and uh so we what we were trying to show uh or that I want to I want to bring and add to what uh we we were ministering on is that we show five Supernatural things Supernatural element that was with Israel the five Supernatural elements that was with the cam of Israel these were Supernatural element that led Israel by day they were it was it was Indian this these were the things that make the identification of the shout of the king these were the things that was in the midst of Israel it was in around them like the scriptures see the the the angels of the Lord are in come about us so we want to look at these five spiritual things we'll identify them in the scripture and uh and pick them up uh uh you know in in the message of the hour so these five spiritual things and uh let me make sure they are okay now so these five spiritual things uh the pillow of Fire the pillow of Fire was the first thing that you have to know the other when God promised Abraham you know that he was going to bring them out by the mighty hand he uh Joseph went into Egypt as a slave and through Joseph the you know the entire Patriot got himself in Egypt but when they exceeded will begin when God will finally when the people have hit 400 years because God says after 400 years Genesis chapter 15 I will come down with a mighty hand and I will I will bring you up so when the people hit 400 years actually it was 430 years because they had to overlap the 400 years because the people were not ready and even Moses himself was not ready so but when the Exeter will begin the first thing that God will send him for an Exeter was the pillow of Fire that was what Moses met in the burning bush praise the Lord it was the pillar of fire that came down and covered that boat and it was just like the Bush was on fire and uh so God Called Moses by the pillow of fire so the pillar of fire called the prophet praise the Lord that's the reason why uh uh uh in in Houston you know the brother Brandon picture with the pillow of fire above his head and that's the way it is with the camp of Israel the pillow fire it first and then the prophet is the second and the third thing that the people have was the ark of the coveting uh uh Exodus chapter 25 God told Moses to build an ark of the covenant and uh uh which which have to do with the Tabernacle the you know what they have at the Tabernacle in the wilderness but what was in the Arc of the Covenant will be laid the the ten commandments so that was the third thing that was in the camp of Israel and now they had a brazing serpent we know that the brazing serpent was therefore healing okay that was their medical center amen when a person was sick you have to look at the serpent you get healed and then the fifth thing that was in the camp was the smithing Rock praise the Lord it was the smitten Rock now this rock represented in the camp of Israel signs and wonders that was that was what it represents I'll show it to you in the scripture uh Paul said in the book of Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 Paul said the rock that followed them was Christ and Jesus said this son shall follow so The Rock was representing signs The Rock was not a Rolling Rock it was not that The Rock was rolling The Rock was representing whenever Israel needed a supernatural God was there to perform it praise the Lord amen so the the church in the wilderness had these five Supernatural things to uh to identify the presence of God in their midst praise the Lord are we together let's let's read from the message I speak to the Rock follow me then as as we read this together now we find you see I don't get I don't get so much excited like when I'm out there because I believe that I have the responsibility to to teach my church so I really want to make sure that um you are opening your mouth and I'm putting the spawn there amen praise the Lord so it's a little bit different now we find that they did already seen this miracle look closely now look what was with them look what was with them they had a smitten rock with them one they could drink from it praise the Lord now you have to realize that immediately when Israel crossed the people were tested for water okay the water of Mara never came from The Rock the water of Mara was a bit of water praise the Lord but Moses was able to make the better water sweet so all of that is all represented under the smithing Rock because it was science and wonders the water were bitter he put his Rock in it and it and it became sweet and the people were able to drink they had a smitten rock with them they could drink from it they had a Brazen serpent with them for healing praise the Lord amen Divine Healing will always be part of the church Hallelujah even death unto the believer is Divine Healing because when we dare we die we step in a brand new body praise the Lord so it's a win-win situation Divine Healing have always been in the Covenant praise the Lord amen will always be with the church signs and wonders will always follow the church we don't have to make it happen all we have to do stay with the word and these things will happen this son shall follow them that believe um praise the lord we don't have to look for the signs before we believe if we believe they are bound to follow us praise the Lord amen they are bound to follow us in in in in in the simple things of our life praise the Lord they have the brazing serpent with them for healing they are a prophet with them that had the word of God so the prophet had the word and the Word was the Ten Commandments in the act of the Covenant so they had a a smitten Rock they had a brazing serpent they had a prophet and they had the word over the prophet was the pillow of Fire that was doing the leading in the night it was a pillow of fire in the day the same pill of fire became the pillar of cloud so the pillar of fire the pillar of cloud is now two different things is the same thing in a day it was a cloud in the night it became a fire so over the prophet was a pillar of fire that was doing the leading and now one time had it ever filled him oh I feel like shouting he hadn't felt God doesn't feel he cannot fail and remain God he is still God the smithing Rock the brazing serpent a prophet and atonement a sacrifice everything Grace has provided for them already damn it amen and after God has done all those things they were like a a lot of people today ha has to be baby around God don't want babies God wants men and women amen he created man in His image when Adam was uh was was was was made he was not made a baby in a cradle he was made a man in the image of God praise the Lord so God is interested seeing you standing on your feet saying you standing as a man seeing you standing as a woman in the image of God Amen now baby crying all over the place God wants men and women amen halleluia he quoted uh Bud Robinson testimony he says uh he said Lord give me a backbone like the size of a lord as our Lord amen he said put plenty of knowledge in the Gable end of my soul and let me fight the devil as long as I got one tooth left and then if I lost that one I'm going to gum him praise the Lord amen that's what we need courage not a washbone we need backbones a real Spirit-filled heart filled with the Holy Ghost Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ Living in a life walking in the path of God keeping his commandment claiming every promise US your own property it's not that we will not have struggles we will but we know in whom we believe [Music] praise the Lord or we will have struggles we will have trouble we will get sick but we know that we we there's healing in the camp and then I was PR I was praying for Brother Mac this morning and and uh while I was praying this taught just kind of for hit me you know uh uh brother Branham said he says healing is life he said life is healing and it hit me this morning because I was thinking about it with everything that the doctors are doing the effort they are making is because they're seeing life in his body if they cannot communicate with his brain anymore and they cannot communicate with his heart animal they are at their limit they can't do anything a person can be lie in coma as long as the doctors can communicate with your brain they will fight everything so so what actually that I give them the motivation is because they see life in the body so life is the Healer so all they are trying to do is to just give you their vitamin put blood there so your blood can start moving again because the note as long as life is in that body if they put the right substance and the right you know medication and everything that body will picks up but when life leave the body they can do whatever they want so life is life is the Healer that's why brother Brandon said Revival is keeping life in the body the devil can blast your mind and he can do whatever he want to do to you as long as you can keep the Living God in your heart [Music] praise the Lord all those people just have a little you know uh a little uh a stir up or something that they just feed or maybe some you know somebody that's dressing the way they don't like I don't like their colors and everything then you stay away from church thank you praise the Lord I mean let the devil blast your mind with the most fatiest thing in your in in in the world let he throw all the habits of of Life against you you can struggle with this and lies and lost and everything as long there's a desire in your heart and you can drag your body in the in the presence of God Amen life is the Healer hmm that's what the old saying says where there is life there is hope because life is the Healer praise the Lord now so when we when we look at this this morning what I want us to do I want us to go to Numbers Chapter One Numbers Chapter One my inspiration this morning is coming from from Numbers Chapter One Numbers chapter one you know the book was named after its attributes numbers is having the numbers of the tribe the numbers of the people the numbers of days and the numbers of death let's read Numbers Chapter One Reading from verse one and the law speak unto Moses in the wilderness of China in the Tabernacle of the congregation on the first day of the second month in the second year after they were come out of Egypt saying take the psalm of all the congregation of the children of Israel after their families and after after their families buy the house or their fathers with the number all their names every meal by the port from 20 years old and upward all that are able to go for to warm that was the age of maturity for fighting thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies now so I just read this uh uh just to kind of forgive us the flavor and then it gets in there and calling all of the tribes and and uh and the numbers of the tribes and the numbers of the different family you will find that right here uh Numbers chapter two that's what I want us to go this morning Numbers Chapter 2 Numbers Chapter 2 from verse 1 and the Lord speak unto Moses and and Aaron saying every man of the children of Israel Israel shall Page by their own standard with an inside of their father's house far off about uh about the Tabernacle of the congregation and on the east side word the the the east side towards the rising of the sun Shah they are the standard of the camp of Judah page now Israel had a formation in the way that they travel they have they have a formation and they use that formation to travel praise the Lord amen that was the way the the you know uh the the organized themselves to travel so we want to we want to look at the cam here we want to look at the camp Let's uh uh uh if if brother if uh uh brother Jordan or sister Faith can put the the Tabernacle just the Tabernacle praise the Lord and if you shut no not this that is just the Tabernacle the the blue Tabernacle if you if you can turn this light off for us okay this this was the tabernacle of Israel I'm hoping the other we can be able to follow this a little bit now this will give you an appetite to read a book of numbers there are a lot of names in the book of numbers that we came people from uh from from reading but this was the tabernacle now you have to realize that the tribe of Levi was chosen by God right amen on this order that God said all the firstborn because he said the firstborn of Israel from the deaf Angel so all the firstborn belonged to the Lord amen but then God now choose the Levites in place of the firstborn that's how the Levi's now became uh a separated tribe praise the Lord so when the inheritance when the camp of Israel was uh well they were giving their inheritance Levi never had no inheritance their portion was the what was the law the Lord was the portion of the land of their living amen now in the Levites there were these three tribes in the Levi's you know God did it in a way you have to remember that the tribe of Israel at 12 tribes amen but when when when uh when when the patriarch came over Jacob adopted the two sons of of of Joseph Ephraim Emmanuel said they were adopted by by Jacob amen that's why you see Ephraim Amana said appear in the 12 tribes there are times they will appear whenever they appear you will never hear the Trap of Joseph praise the Lord amen so in now that God has chosen the Levites for himself out of the 12th tribes Israel is still left with 12 tribes because primary liver is out Joseph is out steps in so the normal remains 12. are we together now so this was the tabernacle this was the the the the the this was the tabernacle now so in the Tabernacle in the Tabernacle the the duties of the Tabernacle was for the Levites if you read Numbers Chapter 3 numbers chapter 3 will will tell you the duties of all of these tribes these three tribes they were all part of the levitical priesthood but their work was different praise the Lord there was a tribe that was responsible for the the uh the inner substance of the Tabernacle taking care of the the lamb steam taking care of the the shortbread they were responsible for that there was one tribe that was responsible for the out the outside of the Tabernacle and there was another tribe that was also responsible for the uh responsible for taking taking up the the Tabernacle and putting it down because you have to remember Israel was traveling with this Tabernacle praise the Lord they'll travel to travel wherever they desire to sit and they they decide to come there is a trap that is responsible to come and set up the Tabernacle one is responsible you know they will come and do that was their work because this man don't go to war right their Duty was to take care of the Tabernacle now you will you will also learn and realize with the the the the the the the trouble of coron and Dayton came because if you read numbers 16 when Cory and dead on Broadway are troubled against Moses you will realize if you go instead it Quran and Dayton they are also of the tribe of Levi praise the Lord now I talk about these three tribes that are honor the Leviticus Bandit but these people do the service of the Tabernacle it was only Moses and Aaron the priest that goes behind the veil praise the Lord these were also Levi Moses and Aaron they were also born of the Trap of Levi amram was was a son of Levi but you have to realize that Exodus chapter 3 when God Called Moses God told him that I will make your brother Aaron your mouthpiece are we together and moreover God called God told Moses to call his brother Aaron and his sons into the priesthood so Moses was going to to adopt them publicly before the Tabernacle there was there was going to be a basin uh of water around uh uh Moses will put his older brother Aaron in that Basin and washed him down get him out whip him anoint him dress him straight into the priesthood and he did it to all the sons of Aaron praise the Lord now this is very very important now we see that God was setting a principle this was going to be a principle of almighty God where the the man that he were called into the priesthood will have to come under the calling of a prophet now you have to realize that God already established Moses as a prophet the pillar of fire call him into the accident and the pillar of fire is instructing him to also call the priesthood who today represent the fivefold ministry praise the Lord you know Paul in the book of Ephesians Paul is actually the one that that talks about the fight for Ministry some God has given pastors some God had given evangelists some teachers you know some Apostles Paul lay out all of those things praise the Lord he was the first age messenger he was the first age Prophet a prophet to the Gentiles but you also realize that Paul never taught us the nature of all of those Ministry because all of those Ministry have a nature praise the Lord and that's the reason why today we have a religious word and you know and I mean a man can he can he can become a pastor you find pastors that don't have they don't have sheeps but they are Pastor just because they went to a seminary school they graduate and I came here to sell it study Pastore I want a pastoral degree you are not a Shepherd until you have ships to lead praise the Lord and you have a you know uh uh uh uh some preachers that I I'm I'm evangelist Apostle missionary Pastor one I take all the I take all the titles praise the Lord because to to many in a religious world this these are just titles right that you can choose whichever one that you want but biblical calling God have to call you you have to be called into the office praise the Lord Hallelujah he says so God set her up in a way that even the Old Testament a priesthood that will lead the people in the presence of God that will that will teach the people to be able to offer sacrifices that will be acceptable to God how to come honor the order of a prophet the prophet had to call the priesthood and wash the priesthood wash us of our ideas our ethnicity and nationalistic spirit and denominational teachings praise the Lord Aaron was the older brother to to Moses but it did not matter to God you have to come in there and Moses had to strap him down read The Book of Leviticus Moses had to strap him Moses had to dress him in that priesthood Rock anoint his hands for what he would touch and not his his big toes for where he would step the tip of his ears for what he were listening to are we together praise the Lord but these other guys they are all Levites they are all of the same tribe that was the problem of Quran and Dayton they thought that Moses was taking too much to himself now we also not Levites yeah you are Levites you have your place praise the Lord your place was not to burn incense right praise the Lord that was the thing that's that that of what God had to strike the prophet desire because it was not his place he was a king he was not a priest praise the Lord this thing where we think that we we we we have the word of God we have the message and you think you have the right to to to to to I mean you know Express the word and do whatever no you have to watch that God have a divine order last one when you see a touch that the the act it was going to fall he had good intentions but the male our destinated to to protect the Earth was the Levites I had a good intention he died out of good intention God don't run his church by Our intention God run his church by the word of God praise the Lord are we together now so this was the tabernacle order these men all had their work they had their work to do I I don't want to do too much of scripture reading here but I can be able to point out via workout just I was just going through that uh uh yesterday or Friday and uh it was it was these were the priests that go right into the holiest of holy now because this side was the holiest of holy most of the time when we look at the compass we look at the compass as North south east and west but that was not the way that God LED his people amen the front direction of God Compass is the east the sun do not rise from the north the sun rises from the East praise the Lord so this this was the front of the camp this was the front of the camp this was the east side of the camp praise the Lord now another thing I want I want you to notice there in the book of numbers is there the Bible says each of these people came on an inside of the camp of Judah now the camp of Judah was different from the tribe of Judah it was three tribes that made a camp just like these three tribes had this place under the levite so can you please put up the cam of Judah for me [Music] praise the Lord so these were the Camp of Judah it was made out of the tribe of Judah the tribe of hissy God and Zebulon now if you actually look at it you read a book of numbers the cam of Judah had the largest number they had the largest number praise the Lord amen so these were the cam of Judah so on the east side of the Tabernacle praise the Lord and can you put the Tabernacle back up for me please if the cam of Judah will honor themselves they must order themselves from this end to this end they cannot go beyond yet they must start from right here to right here and just order themselves down praise the Lord they found their affirmation that way and uh uh let's let's go to uh the nest cam uh that will be the cam of Rubin now you have to realize that Rubin was the first son amen but Ruben Ruby lost the benefit of a person which was he the benefit of the first song was the birthright amen the birthright he lost that over to Jacob he also lost the kingship to Judah and he lost the priesthood to Levi these were the three things that that were that were that were the package of the breath right praise the Lord amen because he he slept with his father's concubine praise the Lord the same problem is the thing that is robbing the church of our benefit the same problem is the thing that is robbing the church from the things that God has already given to the church it was the sea that the serpent sword in Eden that's the reason why until we leave this body such was saying will hunt us it will battle our minds young people you'll always be a child of God like like Ruben was always the son of Jacob but he was robbed of those things so this was the cam of Ruby there were three tribes that were under the camel rubins uh a Simeon and gal let's go to the nest camp foreign now this is the camp of Ephraim now you realize Ephraim and Mana said are sons of Joseph and Benjamin is a brother of Joseph praise the Lord but because they were adopted that's the reason why when Jacob crossed his hands he told he tell Joseph the Lord was the one that moved my hands amen never even knowing that God would have would have adopted a Levi to himself and then and this will actually goes they will actually be placed in the 12th trap of Israel so whichever way you do it Israel will always have 12 tribes praise the Lord because it's a very significant number to God and then are we done with the camps okay this is the cam of dawn so it's also these three tribes that make the account praise the Lord now you have to re realize you remember the last time when we talked on the phobics amen we we we demonstrated the four beef year uh uh and we show how each of those of each of those bees wherever they move all of those forces were income behind that praise the Lord what I want you to realize is that Exodus chapter 25 God told Moses to build the Tabernacle according to the faction that he saw in heaven so this Tabernacle order that Moses is instructing them is going to be the exact way he saw the Beast around the throne right are we together so can you give me the the the the image no the next one the other one before this one this one is the climax no there is one that has all of the the inside the ox the man the ego unless I did not send that one to you I hope not then I would kind of for up myself praise the Lord okay so in Numbers Chapter 2 when we read Numbers Chapter 2 you realize that Moses said that each tribe must live their inside they are standard so it was it was this the the tribe of Judah was always identified with the sign of the Lion that's why we say the lion of the Trap of Judah praise the Lord Dan has a uh the inside of an ego if you go back to Genesis chapter 45 when Jacob was speaking to Dan he first gave down the inside of a serpent but Dying God the inside of an eagle because uh uh uh the ego destroyed the second so they stay with the inside of the serpent now in the uh Ruby you know how the inside of a man fall in nature praise the Lord in front how the inside of an ox so all of those tribe were identified under that Banner as a camp not as a tribe they had their trouble inside but as a camp amen praise the Lord are we together amen now so that's how they move in battle they don't match when the cam of Israel is moving they are moving just like this the Trap of Judah is be before the camp the other trap is here the other trap is here and they are moving they don't mix praise the Lord the reason is because they are not trusting in in their weapons and their Spirit they are trusting that the presence of God is India means praise the Lord even even going across Jordan that was what they did the priest went before they went went right into Jordan when they came with the Ark of the Covenant the moment the the Levi step with the Ark of the Covenant the water padded praise the Lord you see that's that is the importance of preserving the presence of God in the church right the importance of preserving the the presence of God in our home because it's not your ability that blesses you yeah When God says I'm Jehovah Jireh he didn't say because you went to Harvard because you go to Harvard I become Jehovah Jireh no the importance of preserving the presence of God in our life yes are we together because there was the thing the heart the shout of the king in the camp let's let's take a scripture here the Bible says over in first Samuel chapter four let's let's read that quickly then we come back and and close up this image praise the Lord I preach on this subject before like I said I've not been able to bring this image to you like like I'm doing here so I'm just I'm just going back as a as a review as a recap first Samuel chapter 4. are we there let's read from verse 5. first Samuel chapter four reading from verse 5. praise the Lord and when the Ark of the coveting of the Lord came into the camp all Israel shouted with a great Shout so that the Earth rank again verse 6. and when the Philistine heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews and the honest tool that the Ark of the Lord was come in the camp praise the Lord amen so you see the thing that makes the people to rejoice it was not an emotional put up like the people says you know they went around the world of Jericho in a shouted let us shout hey I mean that is just you you can't even feed it right that's just noise it was the presence of God it was the presence of God that was identified with the people we're defended they fear the presence of God that's what brings rejoicing in the church now the pastor baking for Amen Let the Church Say Amen no it's when the word of God rested with the people you won't tell them together from their seat when they were resident with them praise the Lord that's when we say amen hallelujah God bless you is because the presence of the Lord is identified with the people that's the shout of the king that is in the camp Hallelujah amen now so you go there down to to uh to numbers that we just read you realize that number 23 there that uh uh uh Bawa took the uh uh uh uh the prophet bilam on top of the mountain and he was trying to show all the things that he was seeing among all us you see that's an Israeli girl down there see how she dressed all you see that that's the one I called him said message believer oh see this all that's the one that's praise the Lord amen Hallelujah now you see we're not giving license for loose dressing need a license for wrong life praise the Lord because one thing for sure I know God knows how to deal with that Hallelujah I don't have to make you scared of Hellfire if you are a child of God God knows how to deal with that um and also we have to lay the word down so we will not give a wrong impression of what where where our stand is in the world but when when uh when when you will look at the cam of Israel when you will look at the camp if you are on top of the mountain or you were in an airplane and you will look down on the camp of Israel this is how you will see it give me that last picture with the light of place this is how you will see Israel India match this is looking at them from a fireplace so in the mind of God the design that he gave to Moses I was speaking of the cross the sacrifice of Abraham and Isaac was speaking about the cross the raising of the Brazil serpent was speaking about the cross the Lord that's the reason why you cannot take you cannot take the cross of Jesus Christ out of the Gospel you will be left with uh uh uh uh just just just a Amiga church with celebrities because there is not a man or a woman that will ever come to the foot of the cross and never fear its effects this message must bring us to the foot of the cross that's where Humanity was reconciled with God was at the cross of Jesus Christ praise the Lord now why Paul could tell the Hebrew Believers and said without sharing of blood he said you know hmm so this is just the camp of Israel then how much more of the Church of Jesus Christ amen how much more of the Church of Jesus Christ you see why Jesus said it would be better for you to hang a millstone on your neck drawing yourself in the sea then to speak one word are we together then just speak one word honestly concerning for the faith but Brahm says and look what he said well I'm speaking I have not be held iniquity in Jacob Jesus says wheresoever two or three I gather in my name I will be there India mix is the presence of God that makes the difference [Music] praise the Lord and if God is in the midst of his people he covered our shame just like he did to Adam when he took a bleeding skin and threw it on Adam to cover his makingness the presence of God cover praise the Lord you'll see how people like Bala that keep looking for one era or another looking for what to criticize looking for what to point out I have not be held iniquated in Jacob and he was looking from the side of the Rock God said I have not seen him from the hilltop his church his group why there was in a nation there was in an organization like the rest of the people there was an organism praise the Lord but no Nation the people will do earth among themselves they will now be a nation and and that is the way the Church of Gods today they call out group of people it doesn't means because you are a man of this or it doesn't mean because you are Pentecostal it means out of every group God's calling people giving them the Holy Ghost that's the church they call out praise the Lord they are not an organization their hearts are beaten together for the coming of the Lord amen they are one in Christ Jesus why I'm not a Holy Roller look when Balaam come down balak show him the the outermost part the worst part of Israel praise the Lord amen you find people they know how to gossip the Bible called them tables they have a story about everybody they get story about everybody Oh Sister you oh and that one I will tell you about her the guest story they sound funny but it's not funny I'm not making drama here I'm dealing with a spirit I'm not a comedian I hope not praise the Lord the guest story for everything everything they know how to make it up they know the details and it's about spirit praise the Lord it's a bad spirit you are putting God's mercy away from you when you do that when the scriptures command us that even if you know something of a brother go to talk to them which means you are not supposed to even share it with another person unless you have talked to the person right that's the word amen you see why the churches rubbed of its power then you want to blame the pastor or you want that church nothing there when you are actually the problem think about how many times you spend pray for people come on now then talking about them put it on the scales how many times you think about somebody and you spend praying for them praise the Lord the worst part of him when people sit down with unbelievers and start describing the church the church they claim to be part of they take uh uh uh what's supposed to be our our sacred vessels [Music] you know that's why I took Babylon into captivity right when Hezekiah exposed The Treasure of Israel to the Babylonians five identification God's people is his call out people I believe they are in every denomination they could be in Catholic they could be in Protestant they could be they could be Jewish they could be in any kind of a church but the real church is a mystical body of Jesus Christ you cannot organize the mystical body of Jesus Christ now every person that comes to Christ come out of the word come into Christ come into His mystical body and you are a member of that body when you are brought into this church call out and are baptized into this mystical Body by one spirit your water baptism only identify you with the local church the spirit baptism put you in the mystical body praise the Lord just as awful as it will be for you to just go and sit down and and ravage the life of your children you see that God Of Mine He's just crazy that boy he will not become nothing praise the Lord I'll go and sit down and just start to discuss your wife you are destroying the very fabric of your home praise the Lord but you see with the mystical bother you cannot destroy destroy that fabric because God put it together right praise God praise the Lord amen you can't destroy say whatever you want to say about the church the church is marching on [Applause] the treasure is moving power unbelievable only handle the unbeliever praise the Lord by The Church of Jesus Christ is moving forward praise the Lord they can say whatever they want to say about the message we are getting ready for the rapture foreign we are getting ready for the rapture when bellam was doing this when balak tired bellam and he was doing this you have to remember that was when Israel came to babura one of the time where God got so angry with his people and the wrath of God was going to come and smash the cam of Israel right but there was a young man called Phineas praise the Lord and sometimes that's when uh Extreme Measures I need it yes sir in extreme times praise the Lord the Commandment of the Lord dared in the Ten Commandment in the Bible said thou should not kill but when finished house was overtaking because of the iniquity that was in the camp he pierced a man down killed a man with a mobile woman and God said Fini has held back my raft hmm praise the Lord the word of God we never really didn't give it to God he wrote it and give it to us praise the Lord amen let's go to the book of Zacharias let me find a place to close here try to close already past my time yes there's zechariah's chapter 14. praise the Lord amen Hallelujah you love the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we serve amen amen amen praise the Lord Hallelujah now Zachariah spoke a bit in the in uh honor the spirit of Prophecy here praise the Lord Zachariah spoke how the grace of God how the hair stone is going to come down and uh and and and the way that he said it is going to come with with a shout to the people a message of Grace Grace brother Branham used it when he preached the message of Grace and actually in in dad brother Bradham shows that's where the uh the message is a message of Grace are we together now there is something I want to bring to you as uh as uh deal with that foreign myself to a close here kind of for distracted something from my notes and there's a uh I thought I never needed anybody looks like I need it right now so praise the Lord are we together now the uh I said Zechariah is 14 actually it's chapter four it's actually over in chapter four now 14. zechariah's chapter 4 verse 7. praise the Lord then uh Zachariah spoke in uh how he said the hairstone thereof with shouting will come down crying Grace Grace Grace now so brother Branham show in the message of Grace that uh the message the the hair Stone which of course the the the the last messenger of Revelation chapter 3 that have the responsibility to open the seals uh uh the messenger of from Malachi fall to restore the the apostolic feedback you know the fate of the fathers back to the children Revelation 10 7 and uh uh uh were the mighty Angel you know cried and and all of that so we realized that uh there was there was uh there was uh the mistress that was hailing from the foundation of the world was going to be the hair Stone which is the Capstone which is you know the climax so that will come to the church with a message of Grace now this is what I want to I want to kind of for close up here but then also Paul being the first messenger he told the Thessalonian church about the coming of the Lord that the Lord himself shall descend with a shout the voice of the archangel and the Trump of God so if you look at Zechariah prophecy about the coming of the hair Stone which of course that Hearthstone is the Lord Jesus Christ is coming with a shout Grace Grace Grace praise the Lord and you look at Paul prophecy also of the coming of the Lord which is the rapture of the church you realize there is a similarity because Zechariah is saying the hair stone is going to come down with a shout Grace Grace Paul is saying that the Lord shall descend with a shout amen so the coming of the hair Stone and the coming of the Lord is tied together in Prophecy it's one and the same that is the reason why the opening of those seals begin the coming of the Lord amen because that was the mystery of the hair Stone [Music] Christ coming down to Crime his church to cap his church are we together so the sea shout of the king that was in the camp of Israel there have always been in the camp of Israel the shout of the king that was identified in the pillar of fire in the calling of the Prophet the Ark of the Covenant the prison stepping and the smithing Rock the same one that led the Old Testament Church to the promise of their inheritance is the same one that is leading this New Testament Church to the rapture oh that's the reason why he promised his church I will never leave you I will never forsake you praise the Lord Hallelujah so no matter how you look at the Book of Judges look at the Book of Judges those people that were beaten by the Philistines in the middle night where they're not Israel you can look at the Book of Judges and you think that God abandoned his people where was the child of the king where was the shot of the king where was the smithing Rock when the Philistines were beaten and ravishing their wives what what was the presence of they were always the people of God they remained the people of God God never abandoned them one time that's the reason why he was raising up judges he were raising a man of Courage praise the Lord Shin God will just take a dry horse born and go down there and beat those Philistines he will raise up a man like Gideon trembling on himself if God be for us where are the Miracles but when God identified himself he says the shadow Gideon and the sword of the Lord praise the Lord some people think that that the church is wrong by your ideas God is our God he's our maker he's he has made us like the psalmist says and now we have not made ourselves neither have we made our God praise the Lord when when when we when people think that they can wrap their reasoning are we together so we see Zechariah prophecy of the coming of the hairstone we see Paul prophesying that the Lord himself shall descend with a shout and the voice of an archanger praise the Lord and the shout has always been tied to the Lord even from the Old Testament Hallelujah says now that the shout represent the message that gather the people God calling to the hearts of the elect a people that are identified by a voice we have to realize this we are not making a church no this is not a making of a church we must be following the leadership of the Holy Spirit and not picking things and doing things on our own God don't run his church by good intentions he run his church by his word as long as Israel kept in the Apostle Duty as long as they stay on the inside each man honor his inside just like how you saw saw a spread out that was just how the cam of Israel moved that was how the camp of Israel moved as long as they stay in their order almighty God was watching them from above he said I will send Hornets before you that God will use Hornets bees to fight for them praise the Lord I mean we we we we we try to put ourselves in a kind of a sorrowful state that we have to obey for mercy don't seem Supernatural elements is in the camera the bride that same Supernatural element is in the Church of the Living God the shout of the king is the identifying is the identification of Jesus Christ in the midst of his people that while we can say the joy of the Lord is our strength as the shout of the king is in a camp if the people would keep the church clean brother Branham says there's not one prayer request that should be brought in and God will not answer but how will we how will we experience the supernatural how do we want to get the blessings of God when we are stepping out of out of order and glory in the camps of the Philistines all of those mobile camps is a camp that was born out of insects I praise the Lord May Brad Della was taking the service over to brother Elijah's church he preached that message here before I mean on one of our our conventions where he was talking about you know if your eye be single and your eye be evil but there was something there was a way that he brought it and it was just so beautiful you know just just like just just as a challenge to the church you know uh uh you know then you were just kind of rebuking the people trying to make them to see it you know a generation that is just uh thinking that well you know I I got my Bible on my phone it kind of for challenging them that very same phone the things you use it for the movie you watch the sights you go on and yet you have the Holy Bible on it and sometimes we don't even think about it the Holy Bible that you call the word of God and the things that we do on our phones just like how Ruby was tripping from his Blessing he still remained the Sun of Jacob I tell you Church we should be further than where we are in our individual walk with God and even as a church some of the things that is causing our problem we are our own problems let's buy our house together thank you for the cross Lord foreign God gave Israel the sign of her cross for the affirmation and he gave you and myself the same sign oh there is nothing that will be more than the cross of Jesus Christ [Music] there will be nothing that will be more than the cross of Jesus Christ [Music] father we just want to be grateful to you We Want to Thank You Lord we want to thank you Father you remain the same yesterday today and forever [Music] the Lord you have called us you have called us Lord father
