[0:34] foreign
[0:37] that age
[0:40] how strange
[0:42] the Messiah standing up
[0:45] before the church
[0:48] and look at these precious words when he
[0:51] says here to preach the acceptable year
[0:55] the acceptable year as we all know as
[0:57] Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee
[1:00] that when all slaves and prisoners as
[1:04] they were been taken prison
[1:07] and had to give a son to pay a debt
[1:11] or daughter to pay a debt
[1:13] and they were in bondage no matter how
[1:17] long they'd been in bondage or how long
[1:19] they're supposed to stay there when the
[1:21] year come of the Jubilee when the
[1:24] trumpet sounded every man could go free
[1:27] if he wanted to go free
[1:30] they're free you are no more slave
[1:33] but if you desired to remain a slave
[1:36] then you had to be taken down to the
[1:39] temple stood by the temple post and it
[1:43] took a awe and bore a hole in your ear
[1:46] and then you had to serve that slave
[1:50] master the rest of your days
[1:52] what a perfect example it is of the
[1:56] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:58] when it's preached the acceptable time
[2:01] and the time of Jubilee anybody no
[2:05] matter who you are what color you are
[2:07] what denomination you belong to how Spar
[2:11] you stooped in sin or what's wrong with
[2:14] you you can't go free when you hear the
[2:16] God gospel trumpet sound out
[2:20] you are free but if you turn your back
[2:25] up on the message
[2:27] and refuse to hear it notice you were
[2:31] born in the ear with an awe that means
[2:35] to say that you have crossed the line
[2:39] between grace and judgment
[2:42] and you will never hear the gospel again
[2:45] you'll never get any further you must be
[2:48] a slave do the system you're in the rest
[2:51] of your days
[2:52] if you refuse to hear the acceptable
[2:55] year
[2:57] now
[2:58] the other part of it is I said didn't
[3:00] need to be answered because this coming
[3:03] Messiah time now is when he will bring
[3:06] judgment now how could those people ever
[3:12] fail to see who he was
[3:17] how did they ever miss it
[3:20] how could it be when it was so plainly
[3:23] made known and showed
[3:26] how could they have ever missed seeing
[3:29] what what a word think of it this day is
[3:34] this scripture fulfilled before your
[3:37] eyes
[3:39] who said it God himself
[3:42] who is The Interpreter of his own word
[3:45] this day is this scripture fulfilled the
[3:49] Messiah himself standing in the presence
[3:52] of the congregation
[3:54] and reading of word out of the Bible
[3:57] pertaining to himself and then saying
[4:01] today this scripture is fulfilled and is
[4:04] still fail to see it
[4:07] what a tragedy if that would be but it's
[4:11] happened it's happened many times how
[4:13] could it happen of course like you did
[4:16] in other times by believing man's
[4:19] interpretation of the word
[4:22] that's what caused it
[4:24] those Believers in them days so-called
[4:27] Believers was taking the interpretation
[4:30] of what the priest had said about the
[4:33] scripture
[4:34] therefore Jesus not belonging to any of
[4:37] their ranks or their societies
[4:39] he was excommunicated
[4:43] from their company
[4:45] and therefore they could not identify
[4:49] him with them because he was different
[4:52] from them
[4:53] the person of Jesus Christ was so unique
[4:56] that no one should have missed seeing
[4:58] you that was the son of God because he
[5:01] was a perfect identification of the
[5:03] scripture that was wrote of him
[5:06] that's the way any Christian is known
[5:08] what is life identifies the various
[5:11] things that a Christian supposed to do
[5:14] how you can stand there and say this day
[5:18] this scripture is fulfilled right before
[5:21] your eyes
[5:22] how outstanding how so plainly and yet
[5:26] those people misunderstood why is
[5:29] because they took the interpretation of
[5:32] some order of priest that they were
[5:35] listening to
[5:37] and history always repeats itself and
[5:40] scripture has a compound meaning to it
[5:43] and a compound revelation
[5:46] or it's just like it says in the Bible
[5:48] that out of Egypt
[5:50] I've called my son referring to Jesus
[5:53] run the margin on that you find out it
[5:55] also referred to Jacob
[5:57] same scripture Jesus was his greater son
[6:01] Jacob was his son he called out of Egypt
[6:04] which the Scofield represent all other
[6:06] references give to it because that's a
[6:09] scripture it was referring to so it had
[6:11] a a double answer it had an answer to
[6:15] Jacob called out and to Jesus called out
[6:18] and so is it today is the cause that
[6:23] we're in such a turmoil as we are and
[6:26] people fail to see the truth of God is
[6:29] because there's too many man-made
[6:31] interpretations of God's word
[6:35] God don't need nobody to interpret his
[6:38] word he is his own interpreter
[6:43] God said in the beginning let there be
[6:45] light and there was light
[6:47] that doesn't need an interpretation he
[6:50] said a virgin shall conceive as she did
[6:53] that doesn't need any interpretation
[6:56] when God's interpretation of his word is
[6:59] when he vindicates and proves it to be
[7:01] so that's his interpretation by making
[7:04] it come to pass that's where God's
[7:07] interpretation is
[7:09] when he makes his word come to pass he's
[7:12] interpreted it to you
[7:14] like if you've ever been like you said
[7:16] let there be light if there was I don't
[7:18] need anybody to interpret but we get
[7:20] man-made systems mixed into it and when
[7:24] you do you you get it out of line
[7:27] it's always been that way but I still
[7:30] think of how striking it must have been
[7:32] think of it the Messiah why did they
[7:35] fail to see you they caused their very
[7:38] leaders that ought to have noted that
[7:42] ought to be first in the scripture that
[7:44] must have been understanding of the
[7:46] scriptures
[7:47] they belittle this man
[7:50] and said he's the illegitimate child of
[7:53] to begin with
[7:55] we wouldn't believe that years later we
[7:59] don't believe that we would die for the
[8:02] purpose to say that he was a virgin-born
[8:04] son
[8:05] and they'll come to pass a day
[8:08] very things that we see Jehovah doing
[8:10] today
[8:12] man the ages to come that there is will
[8:14] die for the thing that we're talking
[8:16] about today you'll have to do it and the
[8:19] mark of the beast comes on and you're
[8:20] not allowed to preach the gospel this
[8:22] way
[8:24] when the Great Union of churches comes
[8:26] together which is in order right now for
[8:28] the World Church
[8:30] you'll have to seal your testimony with
[8:33] your own life to this
[8:35] you must believe it now
[8:37] if those priests could rise up and
[8:39] condemnity will not condemn it
[8:41] but you say if I'd have been there I
[8:44] would have done so and so well
[8:47] that's in your age but this is your age
[8:50] [Applause]
[8:52] you say it well a piece
[8:55] if he's the same as daddy today and
[8:57] forever the same so he is here
[9:02] but he shares the world has civilized
[9:04] become greater and educated more he's
[9:07] here in a spirit form which they cannot
[9:09] kill or put to death he died once
[9:12] you cannot die again
[9:13] he had to be made flesh in order for God
[9:16] to be put to Death In the Flesh for sin
[9:18] but this time he can never die it's the
[9:20] Holy Spirit now
[9:22] how to think that they had them things
[9:25] against him another thing that he would
[9:28] not join any of their rights
[9:31] then you see that still made him a bad
[9:33] person he wouldn't join their their
[9:36] organizations wouldn't join their
[9:38] priesthood
[9:39] and he wants to have nothing to do with
[9:41] it and then besides all that he tried to
[9:44] tear down what they had built up
[9:48] he went into the temple
[9:50] we call him a meat man he loves but many
[9:53] times he misunderstand what meat this is
[9:57] he was a man of compassion but yet we
[9:59] failed some time to understand what
[10:00] compassion says
[10:02] not human sympathy isn't compassion but
[10:05] compassion is doing the will of God
[10:09] pass through the pool of Bethesda the
[10:11] gate dilate people multitudes of them
[10:15] multitudes is no certain number but
[10:17] they're laid multitudes lead blind heart
[10:19] withered
[10:21] and he had compassion on the people
[10:23] always and he went to one person
[10:26] that was not lame blind hawk or withered
[10:29] maybe he had a prostate trouble maybe
[10:32] you had some little infirmity that was
[10:34] it had at 38 years it wasn't
[10:36] going to bother he was going to kill him
[10:39] he's laying on a pilot and he said will
[10:42] thou be made whole
[10:44] and a man said I have nobody to put me
[10:46] in the water but while I'm coming or
[10:47] someone steps down ahead of me so you
[10:49] could walk he could see he could get
[10:51] around but he was just feeble and Jesus
[10:54] said to him rise up take up your bed and
[10:58] go to your house
[10:59] and Jesus's question on that
[11:02] for you remember the scripture said this
[11:04] no wonder if he'd come to Jeffersonville
[11:07] tonight and make an act like that then
[11:09] still talk about him
[11:11] but remember he came to do one thing was
[11:14] the will of God
[11:16] now that's down in Saint John 5 19.
[11:19] you'll get the answer he said verily
[11:21] verily I say unto you the son can do
[11:23] nothing in himself but what he sees the
[11:26] father doing that doeth the son
[11:28] now they ought to know that that was a
[11:31] very Vindication of the prophecy of
[11:33] Moses for the Lord your God shall raise
[11:35] up a prophet like an unto me do you
[11:38] notice when he seen the man he said
[11:39] Jesus knew that he had been in this
[11:41] condition for many years
[11:43] see being a prophet he saw that man in
[11:46] that condition and went down there and
[11:47] waved waved his way around to those
[11:50] people mincing through the crowd until
[11:52] he found that certain Man passed by the
[11:55] lamb Hawk blinding with her yet a man
[11:57] full of compassion
[11:58] but compassion is doing the will of God
[12:02] now we find him as he would not join up
[12:05] with them he would not have nothing to
[12:07] do in their rights then he was an
[12:09] outcast he would not have any besides
[12:12] that he went into the temple one day a
[12:14] man went in there and found the house of
[12:17] God just doubt contaminated as is today
[12:20] they were buying selling change in money
[12:23] and he turned over the money tables duck
[12:26] ropes and plaid them and beat the money
[12:28] changers out of the temple and looked
[12:29] upon him with anger
[12:31] and said it's written
[12:33] Hallelujah my father's house is the
[12:36] house of prayer that you need an
[12:38] identity
[12:40] you with your Traditions has made the
[12:43] Commandments of God of none effect
[12:45] or could have bunched like I'd ever
[12:46] believe in him no sir they had been so
[12:49] hot watered in the muck of societies and
[12:52] filth of the day until they were so
[12:54] ecclesiastical froze up until they
[12:57] couldn't feel the vibrations of the
[12:59] power of almighty God don't whatever the
[13:02] woman can touch His Garment and get
[13:04] healed by and a drunken Soldier could
[13:06] spit in his face and see a little virtue
[13:09] depends on how you approach it depends
[13:12] on what you're looking for
[13:14] when you're going to church it depends
[13:16] on what you're looking for
[13:18] now we seem standing there no doubt but
[13:21] what the people had already warned
[13:23] warned the priest had warned the people
[13:25] now he's coming over here next seven
[13:28] and when he does don't you listen to him
[13:31] now you might go and sit here but don't
[13:33] pay no attention what he says because he
[13:35] don't belong to our group
[13:37] he's an outcast he has no Fellowship
[13:40] card he don't even have an art uh
[13:42] organization paper with him he doesn't
[13:45] have nothing like that what is he some
[13:48] Renegade boy that was born on your
[13:50] illegitimate Birth by a partner's home
[13:52] that a mother conceived him before they
[13:55] were there and they're trying to hide
[13:56] the thing up for some Supernatural thing
[13:58] we know that when a messiah cometh he'll
[14:01] come down the corners of heaven and go
[14:03] to our high priests and say here I am
[14:05] caiaphases
[14:07] but we find out that he didn't do it
[14:10] that way because it wasn't written in
[14:12] the word that way it was a man-made
[14:14] tradition that caused him to believe
[14:16] that
[14:18] word said that he would come just the
[14:20] way he come
[14:22] there he stood reading the word
[14:25] and saying to them this day this
[14:28] scripture is fulfilled in your eyes
[14:31] and still they failed to see him or
[14:34] recognize him
[14:36] like he did in all other ages Noah could
[14:39] have said the same thing the day that he
[14:41] entered into the ark and the door closed
[14:43] Moses gonna raise that wind in the top
[14:46] yard look out upon the congregation
[14:48] remember God closed the door
[14:50] and he can sit this day this scripture
[14:53] is fulfilled in your eyes
[14:56] that was too late for the man he had
[14:58] preached 120 years to try to get him
[15:01] into that boat that he had built telling
[15:03] him that the scripture said thus saith
[15:06] the Lord it's going to rain
[15:08] but they waited too long but Noah could
[15:11] easily said that the day this day the
[15:13] scripture is fulfilled Moses the same
[15:17] day that the pillar of fire come down on
[15:20] Mount Sinai
[15:21] and give witness to his testimony
[15:25] Moses could have said this day this
[15:27] scripture is fulfilled
[15:29] Moses you know was a call man of God a
[15:31] prophet
[15:32] and while he was being called being a
[15:35] prophet he had to have a supernatural
[15:37] experience
[15:39] in order to be a prophet he had to meet
[15:41] God face to face and talk with him and
[15:44] another thing what he said had to come
[15:45] to pass her no one would have believed
[15:47] it
[15:48] so no man has a right to call himself
[15:51] thus until he's talked face to face with
[15:54] God on a back side of the desert
[15:57] somewhere where he met God himself
[16:00] it's in the world could not explain it
[16:02] away from him he was there he knew it
[16:04] happened every Christian should have
[16:06] that experience before they say anything
[16:08] about being a Christian your own
[16:11] experience
[16:12] I talked to my nephew a while ago a
[16:15] little catholic boy they said Uncle Bill
[16:16] I've run from Pillar To Post
[16:19] but he ever will return to find
[16:21] something might after night before this
[16:23] meeting started he's been crying and at
[16:26] night time he's been dreaming dreams of
[16:28] coming in run up to the altar we're
[16:30] preaching and making a confession that
[16:32] he's been wrong
[16:33] I said Melvin no matter where you try to
[16:36] go how many churches you join how many
[16:38] Hail Marys you say or how many blessings
[16:40] you get from man you've got to be born
[16:44] again of the spirit of God it's the only
[16:46] thing that'll satisfy the human heart
[16:49] that's I know they got a substitute
[16:51] today of being born again to shake hands
[16:53] of the preacher and put your name on the
[16:54] book but friends that is a
[16:58] gift
[16:59] it's not a Bible truth
[17:02] the apostles in the second chapter have
[17:05] to read like this when the day of
[17:07] Pentecost is fully come the pastor of
[17:09] all cotton shall cancel the people
[17:11] what's up on the day of Pentecost and
[17:13] fully cometh inauguration of church
[17:15] there came a sound from heaven like a
[17:16] Russian Mighty Wind and it built all the
[17:18] house where they were setting
[17:21] that's how the Holy Spirit Come the
[17:22] first time that's how it's come every
[17:24] time since that time
[17:27] he's God and change is not
[17:29] now it's the most people they say that
[17:32] was for another day
[17:33] well he's the same yesterday today and
[17:36] forever
[17:37] every time the church ever received the
[17:39] Holy Ghost it's always come like it did
[17:40] the first time under the same
[17:42] prescription Acts 2 38 never has changed
[17:45] never will change like a doctor's
[17:47] prescription for a disease you write out
[17:49] a prescription for a disease the doctor
[17:51] doesn't take it to some quack drugs
[17:54] he puts too much of the antidote in it
[17:56] it's so weak it won't do you any good he
[17:58] puts too much of the poison then it'll
[18:00] kill you it's got to be wrote just
[18:02] according to the doctor and the doctor's
[18:05] prescription on how to receive the Holy
[18:06] Ghost is given to us by Dr Simon Peter
[18:09] whom it has Pentecost
[18:11] I'll give you a prescription repent
[18:13] every one of you and be baptized in the
[18:15] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[18:17] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[18:18] of the Holy Ghost for the prescription
[18:20] you said them is falling even as a man
[18:23] is the Lord our gospel Paul
[18:25] the internal prescription
[18:28] Moses had had this experience he went
[18:31] down into the country
[18:33] and he began to tell the people I met a
[18:35] pillar
[18:36] pillar he was in a burning version he
[18:38] told me to tell you I am that I am
[18:42] go down I'll be with you take up the
[18:45] stick in your hand and hold it up over
[18:46] Egypt whatever you asked will be done
[18:49] well probably some preset nonsense but
[18:52] when they seen the real facts of this
[18:54] take come to pass they couldn't hold it
[18:56] any longer they know he was sin of God
[18:58] then if Moses said he saw that and
[19:02] testified to be the truth then God
[19:05] obligated if that is the truth to
[19:08] identify and vindicate that man's word
[19:10] of the truth
[19:15] if Jesus Christ stood there and read
[19:17] that day this day is this word fulfilled
[19:19] before you God
[19:22] gated to make that word come to pass
[19:26] we stand here at night and say that
[19:28] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday the
[19:30] day and forever God's obligated to prove
[19:33] that to be sold
[19:35] because it's his word yeah
[19:39] now what does it do it takes faith in
[19:41] believing him takes faith in believing
[19:43] his word that it is the truth
[19:46] notice what come to pass when Moses
[19:49] brought the children out and all those
[19:51] that powered him
[19:52] those who did not fall asleep in Egypt
[19:55] but those who followed Moses want to
[19:57] come out of the Red Sea and got out into
[20:01] the Wilderness God came down upon Mount
[20:05] Zion that pillar far set the whole
[20:07] Mountain on fire and a boy spoke out of
[20:10] there God gave the Ten Commandments
[20:12] Moses couldn't walk up there before the
[20:15] people and say this
[20:16] scripture that I have told you as his
[20:19] prophet
[20:20] comes to pass
[20:21] this day our day I told you that God
[20:24] with me you're not bearing a burning
[20:26] bush and a pillar of fire and he said
[20:28] this I'll this will be a sign you'll
[20:31] bring the people right back to this
[20:33] place here again and there is God in the
[20:36] same Pillar of Fire I told you then
[20:37] hanging right down around the mountain
[20:40] this day this prophecy is fulfilled here
[20:44] is to vindicate that the things I've
[20:47] said is the truth God give us more man
[20:49] like that that's honest fear and tell
[20:52] the truth that God Almighty could
[20:55] vindicate that his word is still truth
[20:58] he remains the same yesterday ever why
[21:00] wouldn't he do it he promised to do it
[21:04] Joshua you might have said the same the
[21:06] day that he come back
[21:09] to Katie sparnia where they had
[21:12] journeyed so far in the wilderness they
[21:13] were doubting the land being the kind of
[21:16] land that God said it would be but God
[21:18] told them it was a good land he was
[21:20] flowing with milk and honey
[21:22] and Joshua and Caleb was the only two
[21:24] that would believe it out of the other
[21:26] ten that left
[21:27] when they come back they had the
[21:29] evidence
[21:30] they had a bunch of grapes a two strong
[21:33] men could only carry
[21:36] Joshua and Caleb could have stood right
[21:37] there and said this day this scripture
[21:40] is fulfilled here's the evidence that it
[21:43] is a good land sure
[21:46] what there's the evidence that it's a
[21:49] good land where'd you ever get such
[21:50] things as that in Egypt there was no
[21:53] such places but this day this scripture
[21:56] is fulfilled he could have said a thing
[21:59] same when he prophesied and said the
[22:02] walls of Jericho would fall down after
[22:04] they marched around seven times seven
[22:07] days seven times a day and when they
[22:09] marched around that last time the walls
[22:12] fell down Josh away

[22:16] and said this day the chief captain of
[22:20] the host of the Lord that told me weeks
[22:22] ago that it would happen like this this
[22:24] day this scripture is fulfilled verily
[22:27] the walls flat on the ground come on

[22:59] sometimes I might could stop here if I
[23:01] had time to give you just a little tip
[23:03] sometimes you may be sitting out of a
[23:05] cancer you might be sitting with a
[23:06] disease you think why not me being a
[23:09] Christian would be in this way
[23:12] sitting like this if I'm a Christian
[23:13] sometimes God lets the things get so
[23:16] dark that you can't see up around or
[23:18] anywhere else and then he comes and
[23:19] makes a way to it for you she might say
[23:22] this date this scripture is being
[23:24] fulfilled
[23:25] that he promised to do
[23:27] you let the Hebrew children walk out
[23:29] into the fiery furnace they said our God
[23:31] is able to deliver us in this far in the
[23:33] furnace but nevertheless will not bow
[23:35] down to your image when they walk down
[23:37] there at the smell of the Furnace upon
[23:38] them no spelling for his brother upon
[23:40] them they could have said this thing is
[23:42] this scripture fulfilled
[23:44] Daniel comes in the Lion's Den he could
[23:46] have said the same thing
[23:48] John the Baptist after 400 years of
[23:51] ecclesiastical teaching no one of that
[23:54] church is in a mess at that time when he
[23:57] appeared in the wilderness the Jordan he
[23:59] could have stood right down the bank as
[24:00] he did and say this day this scripture
[24:03] Isaiah 40 is fulfilled
[24:07] how I could stop here and tell you what
[24:09] that old priest told me said Son you
[24:10] never finished that message I said keep
[24:12] silly said you mean that Pentecostals
[24:14] don't see that I said no he said I see
[24:16] it in a Catholic priest
[24:17] [Music]
[24:19] he said why didn't you go and I said
[24:20] keep still
[24:21] it's the glory to God I see it and about
[24:24] that time the Holy Ghost stood on his
[24:26] sister sitting out there in a meeting
[24:27] and she raised up speaking in unknowing
[24:30] tongues tongues and gave the
[24:31] interpretation of the very thing that
[24:33] the priest and I were talking about on
[24:34] the platform
[24:40] Robert's convention last week or week
[24:42] before last he went to talk to the
[24:44] convention how did that priest say not
[24:46] the Holy Spirit revealed out there
[24:48] through a woman his sister I believe it
[24:50] was or what was taking place up there on
[24:52] the platform
[24:53] and revealed that thing that we were
[24:55] hiding
[25:00] the hour that we're living this day this
[25:03] scripture is fulfilled
[25:04] this day the evening lights are coming
[25:08] and we fail to see it notice John said
[25:12] this day I am the voice of one crying in
[25:15] the wilderness that said the prophet
[25:17] Isaiah prepare the way for the Lord
[25:20] they didn't understand said oh you're
[25:22] Jesus you're the Christ rather he said I
[25:24] am not the Christ he said I'm not worthy
[25:27] to lose his shoes
[25:28] but he said he's standing among you
[25:30] somewhere
[25:31] or he was sure that he would be there
[25:35] he'd be in his day because God told him
[25:37] he was to introduce the Messiah
[25:39] one day a young man's come walking down
[25:41] there and he seen her uh like a light on
[25:44] the top of him aside and he cried out
[25:46] Behold the Lamb of God this day this
[25:49] picture is fulfilled before him sure
[25:53] at the day of Pentecost how Peter stood
[25:56] up and quoted their scripture of Joel 2
[25:58] 38 when there was all life of those
[26:00] people they couldn't talk in their own
[26:02] language they would jabber off some else
[26:04] the Bible said clove and tongues cloven
[26:06] is a party tongue not saying nothing
[26:08] just a jabber and running around like a
[26:10] bunch of drunk people they all said well
[26:11] these people are drunk look at it look
[26:14] how they're acting how them women and
[26:15] men are disorderly said that religious
[26:17] group of that day Peter stood up in the
[26:20] midst of them
[26:21] any brethren

[26:25] the dwell in Judea let it be known unto
[26:27] you these are not drunk as you suppose

[26:33] that which is spoke of by the prophet
[26:34] Joel it'll come to pass in the lazy uh
[26:38] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh this
[26:40] day this scripture was fulfilled
