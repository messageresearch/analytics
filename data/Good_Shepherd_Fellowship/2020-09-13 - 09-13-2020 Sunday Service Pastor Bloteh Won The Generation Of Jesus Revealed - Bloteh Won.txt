[Music] is [Music] jesus [Applause] the lord bless you the lord bless you you can have your seed praise the lord amen what almighty god we serve jesus is the girl we serve amen praise the lord the truth about that is that uh brother branham says jesus body after his ascension was is sitting on the throne of god when we get to heaven that's the only image that we will see but his his body is there as a memorial and that memorial is because of the blood you know the body stains as a memorial before the father that the blood was sheared for the redemption of the word amen praise the lord but the actual body of jesus is this body on earth is this body which is the church and uh the church is the greatest move of god that is on the earth so if you if we if we miss the purpose of the church if we miss the purpose of why we are gathering here i mean we miss everything praise the lord you know we miss everything can uh that that will be that would be the greatest sin you know that uh a man or a woman would commit is is missing the purpose of god for our lives praise the lord you know so we will talk a little bit about that this morning you know uh because even jesus said in saint john he says in that day you will no longer pray to me you know we prayed in the name of jesus but we don't pray to jesus you know i know just a lot of information for an introduction this morning but i pray that the holy spirit will be able to help us as we look into the subject this morning but we greet you in the name of the lord jesus we want to bring greetings from brother paul lafontaine uh just like i said wednesday night we met him over dead in uh in china uh brother uh juan and steve cassidy and myself travel there the uh to support them in the service they were having that night brother paul i actually forgot but he sent me an email uh earlier this year that he was going to be bringing his mother down to uh i think the milwaukee area and then he was going to get in contact with me and he was going to fly from the year and spend the sunday with us and go back and pick up his mother that's where his mother is originally from so they couldn't make the trip because of all of the kovic thing going on so they decided to do the trip this time around so brother joe got a hold of him and he was preaching there for brother jordan we went to visit with them a little bit and and have us had a service our sister we were praying for sister mary uh that was in the accident went to be with the lord last saturday so yesterday they had a funeral i spoke with her pastor bernard michael brown i was actually planning to go for the funeral yesterday but then something came up too so i couldn't go but uh uh they laid our sister to rest yesterday and uh and we want to just thank the lord for that praise the lord amen and uh [Music] one of our one of my senior brothers also back home passed away so they will be doing his funeral next week as well so i mean it's just been so many people going home amen praise the lord but if the lord is keeping us here i believe he's keeping us here for the purpose praise the lord amen so uh i mean i know we kind of escaped our our communion service last sunday but there are just some few things that uh we've been praying about and i'm hoping that we can be able to to have our next communion service coming up here soon by the grace of god but uh like you all know we never want to make those things uh you know just a tradition we never want to just get ourselves so common to it you know there's a blessing when the local church you know walk in the light of the scripture that way keeping communion watching one another faith baptising and all of those different things that the lord has instructed us to do there is surely a blessing for it and uh but yet you know we try to look at the local body you know and make sure that we can be able to bring those things uh in in the right time for it to be a blessing for it to be a blessing and uh there are some few things upon my heart that i've been praying about and just asking the lord how he's going to help us how he's going to lead us in dealing with those things praise the lord i'll find time for us to talk about it but this morning we will we will go back to uh a little bit of what we were speaking on wednesday night uh like we said brother prater came and then he brought us a very wonderful message on the revelation of jesus christ and he hired us to be able to look at some few thoughts on that subject so this morning i would i would just love to trust the lord trust the holy spirit and be able to go back i don't know if i would continue from where we stop on wednesday night but and how to be able to take it this morning but i want to use this subject to be able to grab your attention on something so i pray that the lord will be able to help us to do that uh this morning praise the lord let's stand on our feeding and let's sing a song here um can we sing the song i'm standing in out of you you are beautiful beyond description so marvelous for words let's just worship the lord a little baby you are beautiful beyond destruction to my like nothing never said oh here who can grab your infinite wisdom who can fight on the depths of your love you are beautiful beyond description my justin in troll above i stand [Music] holy god too all praises do i stand in the standing out of you blessing death [Music] [Music] [Music] i stand in [Music] you deserve the glory thank you jesus thank you father [Music] oh [Music] as go [Music] thank you father [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] is [Music] praise the lord amen that's the reason why we are here this morning it's not because of ourselves is to worship him amen we want to bring all the praise and all the glory and all the honor to the lord the lord bless you thank you musicians amen let's take our bible revelation chapter one verse one revelation chapter one verse one the lord revelation chapter one verse one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sinned and signified by his angel onto his seventh john to bear wrecker of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and did that year the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is ahead amen father we approach your sacred word this morning dear lord what a wonderful father you are what a great god you are beautiful beyond description lord so my beloved for worse far beyond what we can comprehend the lord we come this morning humbling our hearts before you the father you will come in speak to us lord speak to us lord the hour is late the dead is upon us lord jesus and lord god we want to see ourselves lord as your children in your in the likeness of your word in the merit of your word this morning we just pray to god that you will come minister to us now we love you we appreciate your father in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat we'll do a little bit of like a bible studies here this morning just like we try to do on wednesday night i'm hoping that the grace of god will would just calm down and bless the service like he did for us wednesday night amen we had a good time wednesday night and and we thanked the lord for that we were looking at the revelation of jesus christ and and like the way i said it is that the bride of jesus christ is the continuation of the revelation of jesus christ praise the lord we are the continuation of the revelation of jesus christ and this is what we were we were studying and looking the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him looking at that phrase that god gave jesus the revelation of jesus christ praise the lord so we were trying to go back to genesis chapter 1 uh and you know and we went to genesis chapter one in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and we came to sin john chapter one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so we were trying to see god that created the heaven and the earth was the word you know uh in john chapter 1. now but this morning i want us to look at matthew chapter 1 matthew chapter 1. i just pray that the law will just capture us in this world and we can just have a prayer meeting at the end of this service instead of having a long long preaching we can have a prayer meeting praise the lord amen matthew chapter one we'll come back to our our subject in revelation chapter one matthew chapter one the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham is is amazing in a way that god inspired these men to write this book why would they put the son of david before the son of abraham when abraham was before david praise the lord but you see god god god is into acts like brother branham said brother branham says god is into us amen god is into music you know uh uh and the way that god write his word the way he give his word to us is is is a perfect at work a kind of a beautiful artwork but uh i i keep you thinking i'm dead why they had to put david before abraham that's not what i'm talking on this morning anyway praise the lord the book of the generation of jesus christ this caught my attention i spoke on this years back one time in south africa on the convention i was i was after a long time i've been there i went to do uh uh end of the year convention and uh you know and the brother coming to preach all the services which of course i never knew that was the way he said it and and then i told him i said i said brother i'm i'm tired you know he says well you just have to do it you know so one of the evening i decided to take this subject on the generation of jesus christ reveal and uh i don't know if i did a good job but uh but i all i can remember was that i was tired now if you if we read this you go through the the the names here as the scripture speaks about it abraham beget isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob judah and his brethrens and you go down and you go down and you go down now [Music] in verse 16 and jacob beget joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called the christ now look at verse 17 so all the generation from from abraham to david uh 14th generation now the scriptures here it is kind of opportunity right at the beginning the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham but when you come down here the bible says all the generation from abraham to david because that's the way it is 14th generation and from david on to the caring away unto babylon our 14th generation and from the carrying away into babylon onto christ's 14th generation then verse 18 stats now the birth of jesus is on this wise i thought verse 1 told us that this was the generation of jesus christ praise the lord matthew said this is the book of the generation of jesus christ but is giving us all of this generation unto jesus christ praise the lord i'll leave you hanging in there a little bit i know you won't fall praise the lord we will come back to matthew chapter one let's go to genesis chapter five genesis chapter five genesis chapter five there's a reason why i want us to look at this and sometimes you get caught up in all these you know uh presentation of the scripture and sometimes you you miss the purpose because it all becomes knowledge and the word really don't go home the purpose of the word of god is for the feeling of our souls is for the changing of our life the healing of our body the the deliverance from the things that are bothering us those sin that easily beset us the word of god must come all the time to deliver us but sometimes when we get into this china we only stick up here praise the lord and uh and it sounds like a wonderful ceremony sound wow i never saw this in the scripture that's beautiful but the reason why god wants you to see it is to be able to arm you against the enemy praise the lord genesis chapter 5 verse 1. this is the book of the generation of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him male and female created he did him and blessed him and called their names adam male and female but he called their names adam so right in there god perform a wedding praise the lord and that's the reason why adam could not put away his wife because they were already blessed under the marriage coveted that's another thing in that day when they were created and adam lived uh a hundred and thirty years in in and beget a son in his own image after his own i mean after his image and called his name set in the days of adam after he beget after he had begotten said were 800 years and he beget sons and daughters and all the days of our all the days that adam leave were 913 years and he died now uh let me let me take another example here um genesis chapter 37 let's look at genesis chapter 37 now what i wanted to show in that scripture as we look at this other one is that when it comes to the generation and as the bible will play it out with different scripture the generation of a man would take him back to his father but what will happen is that it would come back to him and it would continue with him to his sons praise the lord so the generation of adam took us back to the beginning when god made man in his image praise the lord it bring us to adam and then it take us from adam to his sons praise the lord that's a man's generation but what we saw in matthew chapter 1 as the generation of jesus it ends with jesus praise the lord it will have easily been the generation of of adam that end with jesus or the generation of david that end with jesus are we together praise the lord genesis 37 i think what is happening here in the scripture yeah as the bible gave us this information uh the bible is uh we have to know that uh our bible came to us from a translation so i'm that i'm not translate i'm not a translator i'm just i'm just trying to show us something in the scripture but you know uh uh genesis chapter 37 let's look at this also these are the generation of jacob joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren's and and the lead was with the sons of bihar and with the sons of zelfer his father's wife and joseph brought unto his father their evil report now as as we look at this also if the generation of jacob is talking about joseph but is going to go through the sons of of of jacob is going to tell you know talk about all the sons of jacob and he's going to go on and on and on so uh what i want to wrap your attention on the year where we were actually see it in isaiah chapter 53 isaiah chapter 53 it's one of the sublime scripture in the bible isaiah chapter 53 actually there should have been my scripture reading this morning but uh this is a prophecy of our lord jesus and we all know that verse eight let's look at verse eight he was taken from praising and from judgment and woosha declared his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he struck him praise the lord so that's the reason why martial can give us a generation of jesus christ from abraham down to jesus and he cannot go any further because by profits a year his generation will not be declared we can declare his generation oh my goodness are we together praise the lord amen who can declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he struck him verse 10 yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed now nobody will be able to declare his generation according to what isaiah said in prophecy but when he went farther he said after after he would make this offering of his sword then you will see his seed so the generation of jesus christ is going to be a spiritual birth that's that's the reason why we are born again by the sea incorruptible which is the word of god amen do you see what i'm going to this morning the generation of jesus christ is not it's not named after natural birth is not named just like the rest of the other generation is named in the scripture because he will be cut off from the land of the living after he has died for our transgression but when he have made an offering of his soul then that's when his generation will begin when his spirit comes back on earth like it did on the days of pentecost amen when his spirit comes back on earth when he get a people for his namesake when he gets when he get a church when he get a bride he get a people that he's he's dealing with your life he's living it's not a generation that we can name by tribe it's not a generation that we can name by denomination it's a generation that we can name by birth praise the lord amen amen it's a generation that we can name by birth are we together verse 10 and he pleased the lord to bruise him he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his sea he shall prolong his days after he has made his soul an offering for sin then he will be able to bring birth and he will see his seed and he will prolong his days praise the lord amen amen and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hands what what what up what a prophecy what a prophecy the thing that god desire the pleasure the reason why he created the word because paul said we are made for his pleasure the reason why he made a word the reason why he stepped down from the great internal spirit the reason why he allowed all of these things will prosper in his hands after he has made his soul an offering for sin and he will see his seed and he will prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord we prosper in his hands oh my praise the lord amen are you ready this morning praise the lord what a prophecy now if you look also in luke chapter 3 verse 23 it brings also the the generation of jesus christ which actually is the genealogy of jesus christ if we have to look at it that way but i don't want to go into that but what the what what what matthew did is the same thing that luke did it's just that they both take it in a different way matthew run the generation of jesus christ up to joseph was married mary and when luke did it luke also run the generation of jesus christ but it was more of mary's family so what what the two apostles were doing under the holy spirit is to show that both joseph and mary was in the bloodline of jesus christ so both joseph and mary they were chosen god watched over the blood traveling their bloodline to make sure that these both people are the right people to be in the lineage of jesus christ just matthew showed joseph in the lineage of jesus christ luke shaw married in the language of jesus christ because when abraham was looking for the bride for his son he said don't take her from anywhere else but god to my father's house rebecca has to be of the same bloodline the isaac came from are you seeing the picture so mary and joseph how to be in the bloodline of jesus christ praise the lord that's the reason why before we call them our wife we first call them our sisters and we must respect them as our sisters because brother branham says the world will be your sisters you must respect them because it's the same bloodline amen are we together it's the same bloodline oh yellow my mind is spinning this morning but i want to stay i want to stay in my in mind now my subject this morning praise the lord amen so we see here that uh uh machiu is showing us of trying to speak about the generation of the of jesus christ but it does not he does not speak of anything that has to do with a seed that comes after jesus in every in every generation that you will read in the bible whether it was a generation of abraham or the generation of adam or of jacob all the different generation even their enormous chapter three the generation of of aaron and moses is spoken of but it speaks of their children it speaks of their offspring after it speaks of their father it comes to them and then it speaks of their offspring but when it comes to the generation of jesus christ it becomes a mystery it becomes something that is hating because it comes to jesus on this wise jesus was born and then it did not say anything again it just go into his life praise the lord amen amen now this will now help us to see and understand the revelation of jesus christ the important of that revelation the importance of that statement of that expression in revelation chapter 1 why the holy spirit have to say it that way the revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him because in this revelation of jesus christ that's where we will see his generation his generation will be revealed in the revelation of jesus christ praise the lord amen i don't know what i've said i've started sweating feeling good amen praise the lord ah yeah yeah it looks like you are pulling more out of me than i'm even speaking amen because it looks like my inner chef starts to work this morning or maybe it's a little bit hot uh yeah but so let's let's just go ahead now as we were saying on on on on on wednesday night the revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him for him to show unto his servants the revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him remember we read this on wednesday night i go back to that again question and answer on genesis and uh it's pretty much the same code i just i just added another one there the uh sister faith but it's yeah i just kind of repeated here's the message we have jesus was jehovah in building flesh come down in veil now god father son and holy ghost is not like your finger one like some people think the whole thing i i just unfolded to you a while ago that there's a trinity in the one i'm a trinity in one i'm so body and spirit in one person and everything you look at is in the trinity and a trinity in one there is a trinity in the act the bottom floor where the creeping things were the second floor was the flowers the flying things and the terraflow was nowhere in his family in the tabernacle there was a congregation a holy place and the holiest of holy so it's just three compartments but that is not with god amen god is one year old israel the lord our god is one amen he's not three person in one he's one person manifesting himself he manifested himself in three different offices are we together and the reason why is because of the greatness of our god that's the reason why we cannot reduce him to a denomination or to a church god is great are we together and this great god there is no way that we could comprehend him we could understand him he has to deal with us by dispensation and different manifestation for us to be able to understand him are we together so we see the tabernacle there there there are three places there then and and and and there's been three dispensations fatherhood sonship and the holy spirit dispensation see what i mean what we don't say our gods that's hidden and the jews know that but when you can make it to him that this jesus is god jehovah god not as not a second person or a third person is the same person all the time making himself manifest amen is the same person all the time manifesting himself breaking himself down amen praise the lord just so we can be able to understand him we can have an idea of the god that we watch it are we together even though the lord our god is one but not just one as my standing finger amen it's supposed to be in my mind i can say the lord our god is great not so much in his power but so much of who he is praise the lord so much of who he is just to know that right now as we are sitting down right now as you are sitting down listening to the sound of my voice god knows what you're thinking in your mind he knows how much your heart is beating he knows the number of the head on your head he even numbers them when the scripture says he numbers then does not means that he count then you know which one is one you know which one is two amen he knows how your mind is running he knows what you're thinking right now as you are sitting down and looking at me that's how great our god is there is nothing that is happening that he is absent from there is nothing that is happening now that he's absent from innocence that he does not know about that's the reason why paul says it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the living god it's a fearful thing to think that we have a secret in our life that nobody knows about amen it's a fearful thing because there is nothing you can hide from god there is nothing you can hide from him there is not even a flea that can move without god maury that's how great he is that's how great and and and that is the greatness that he's pulling us into i would tell you that this age among all the ages because since this is the age where his days was going to be prolonged and his siege was going to be manifested this is the age this is the age where god brought his greatness so close to us praise the lord in the ministry of a prophet and that prophet ministry that same gift that was standing behind the pulpit that could tell people their names and things that happened to them when they were a little boy that a little child that same gift called the holy spirit is here this morning that is the god that we serve he knows when your habit begins he knows what he runs down talk not only that he knows but he knows the kill and he's able to deliver us amen are we together amen i'm trying to pull away from from from this mystery of godliness and we could run through scriptures here and and spin our mind and become so excited i'm trying to draw back and bring us the reality that we are not just playing church amen we are not just playing church we are in the presence of the almighty god hallelujah praise the lord in the presence of almighty god that same god that created the heaven and the earth amen that same god has began a new creation in you and myself and that is god's concern you see god watching over your life and he and he protecting you and he's providing for you is because of his creation the new creation that he has started in you are we together that's that is the reality that is the reality that that uh that that the devil tried to hold back from us he tried to hold back that reality from us if he can give us three gods a great one in heaven a lesser one that came and died and set him down by his father feeling sorry for us oh father forgive them and and and and and the holy spirit that we that that that we think we have we have control over because we have the holy spirit no he have us he redeemed us he possesses us amen amen the revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him oh there's just a lot of things we can go into this morning i was thinking about that yesterday while i was studying my mind was thinking about you know why brother branham called michael as there are places where he referred to michael the angel michael that's christ and and i would just start i was just trying to go back into all of that you know just like when we signed the song what almighty god we self you know angels by before him yeah and and brother branham tell us you know for god to become god he has to have something to worship him and he and he created the angels to worship him in the beginning but they were now worshiping him in in the form of the great intent of spirit because a worship is not complete until you have an image that you are worshiping amen so he became the image of the invisible god collusion chapter one he was the image of the invisible god and that image was not like something that is make unto god you see that's the reason why when brother branham said that that that adam was an amateur god and god made man in his image is not like you know god is here and he made something that looks like him no he made something that he can express himself true the image of god is something that god can express himself through something he can come endured in and give us an idea of who he is it's not god making image like man make image a man can make an image that look like to him michael angelo he makes an image that looks like onto a more like onto moses but when god makes an image it's something that god made and he expresses himself through that thing hallelujah yes that's the image of god yes yes and that is the only reason why adam can be an amateur god because god was expressing himself through others praise the lord are we together amen so the revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him when god let's let's read collusion chapter one i don't want to do a go-head teaching but it's just hard to be able to bring bring out the subject without going into this but i'm sure the lord is going to help us amen he knows where our heart is he knows what we are trying to labor under this morning praise the lord amen if you read from from verse one this is all talking about christ you know uh paul is talking about christ in an amazing way here but verse 15 will bring us to the place uh verse 12 giving thanks unto the father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the sins in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of our sin now you see what some sometimes these things are important is because when we come on the subject of the godhead in some ways it make us to feel that we have a superior knowledge of of the word of god and the denomination are in darkness because they believe in trinity that's not the purpose of the godhead the purpose of the godhead is to take you from the kingdom of darkness and put you in the kingdom of light for us to be the light of the world is god getting the hold of our life is not just to give you our understanding that jesus is god and we just stick with that praise the lord the purpose of the of the godhead is to be able to take us from the kingdom of darkness if god the creator of the universe if god is one if we have this understanding if it's the true god that we are worshiping then we will not be bound by change we must not be enslaved by habits we must not be uh uh uh uh you know being subjected to to defeat and fear that's the purpose of the godhead because what god trying to reveal to us is that you are the body you are the one now i have redeemed to be able to reflect myself true to be able to leave myself true are we together now so paul goes here and he says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature that was the first thing that god made in one sense was to give birth to himself in another sense what to convince himself into a body of light that we call the logos in the beginning was the word the word was with god because this great invisible god the great internal spirit we cannot comprehend him his ways are past finding out praise the lord to know that he's in our midst this morning he's in our midst but yet he has given us a channel through which we can hear through him god is in our midst this morning it takes nothing for him to speak in this building and for everybody to hear him it takes nothing for god to do that this morning as i'm speaking to you it takes nothing for god to speak audibly but you see in his greatness he takes a channel because one time he tried the people say no speak to moses and let moses speak to us the god that created the universe the one that woke us up this morning the one that gave us birth in our body that we are breathing we are in his midst we are in his presence amen he's the image of the invisible god the one that the invisible god expresses itself through for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible invisible whether they be troons whether they be dominion whether they be principalities everything was created by him can you think about it a god that created his own adversary only to show that he's god what a dominion whether power principality everything was created by him all things were created by him and for him amen and he is before all things and by him all things consist praise the lord that's that's the greatness and you know brother branham show us that the greatness of god is manifested in three ways as an only present god a god that is everywhere amen the omnipresent god and how many sins god that knows everything and an omnipotent god that has the power of everything that's that's the greatness of god that's been revealed to us in this hour the one that we are worshiping the one that we pray to is a god that he has the power praise the lord amen lord show us the father and he suffices us now my parents both before we were catholic my brother you see there's not much cattle left in me as as the triangle that's right yes they believe in their internal sunshine all uh there's three actual individual being god the father an old man with a long white beard god the son a middle-aged man and the holy ghost asks a mascot boy like there is no such thing there is only one god and i differently agreed with the organization of of penny custer that called the oneness like your finger is one that's wrong absolutely wrong jesus couldn't have been his own father and if god is a man then jesus was born sexually desired and not a virgin birth that said to the whole thing you see if he's one like your finger then what then he was his own daddy how could he have been that's wrong he's the father amen praise the lord great is the mystery of god reveal that's the greatness red brand i mean is this the time he says that was one of the mystery of god that was he'll honor the seals and we know all of those mysteries that were here under the seals were for the bribe redemption and god has revealed those mysteries in this day you see that's the reason why even with the message of the hour and and and all that god has given us in this age sometimes it's is it it just looks like you know uh like like brother branham says when when and you know when uh when the bride would find her place the rapture would go it's because even in some of these things we have the mystery of god we understand the revelation of god jesus christ is god but what are we doing with that even with those things in our hands the devil is still pounding our heads like brother branham said he says the name of jesus is just like the stick that moses had amen amen it's just like that roar he had in his hands when he stepped down there before before pharaoh knowing that they were the greatest army in the world but he could step down there in the name of jesus he could step down there in the name of the i am that i am and he was not afraid because he knew he has come in the presence of almighty god and that presence was going with him we know that brother branham sent us a prophet i mean god sent us a prophet brother branham was god's prophet we know that jesus christ is god we know we we have all of these things all is wrong to do this it's wrong to do we have all of them but yet with everything that god has equipped us with we are still living in fear we are still being tolerated by the devil that's the reason why young people we don't just want to bring you to an understanding we don't want to bring you just to a hair knowledge amen but we're trying to say there is power in this world amen there is power in this world if you just love the word for it to live through you then just seeking to know the word it's two different things amen seeking to know the word seeking to understand that god has seeking to understand this is just like you going to your university amen surprised me that uh we we go to higher institutions to become smart and people go there to learn to be smart and be better and it starts to do foolish things amen they place the wind to be smart and better it's the very same place they stay they start piercing their ear they start smoking they start doing things that they're not supposed to do [Applause] have the church not become the same thing we have come to this place in our age with the mystery of god reveal with god with what we have done in our age and we still sit under this word with fascists and gracious and bitterness and we put brother branham tapes on we listen to the message we hear the discernment all of those things just excite our mind the purpose of this world is to be able to live through us to give you a daily victorious life amen to give us a dealing victorious life that's the reason why john can say this young people greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world because on the island of patmos that's what he saw he saw the revelation of jesus christ he saw the one that was standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks he saw the one that was revealing to john who is the first horse rather who is the second horse rather and the one that was doing it was jesus christ and he's the one that is doing everything in his church he's the one that is helping us to overcome he's the one that is changing our lives he's the one that is bringing us closer to him he's the one moving in the seven bowling candlesticks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks it's jesus and jesus alone amen this revelation this revelation of jesus christ that god gave unto him right from the beginning right from the beginning the invisible spirit given to him as the firstborn of everything that's the reason why from genesis to revelation you remember when when samson parents met that angel manoa and his wife they said we will we will make a sacrifice an angel came and he says well what should we say is the one that have taught us these things the angel said to them behold my name is secret right amen they felt on their faces oh we have seen god with our eyes through the ages he's been revealing himself little by little little by little amen when he came and took on flesh that's when he was giving a human name jesus brother branham explained it this way it's like two men going to uh uh go into the ocean to go and and test the great seed and see all the component that is in it and one man take a whole business fill it up and another person just go with a spoon he says whatever element that guy that took the whole truck fought will get the one with the spoon will get the same amen jesus was the truck for the fullness of god was in him amen praise the lord amen the fullness of god was in him amen and you and myself we are just a spoonful i'm just a teaspoonful amen but the same element the same element praise the lord are we together the revelation of jesus christ is more than a doctrine it's more than a doctrine it's more than the teaching is more than what we can argue about that jesus is god and jesus is not god and i mean and and there is no trinity and sometimes we just we just get so arrogant about it even our lord jesus when he was here on earth the fullness of god dwelling in him you never see jesus going down to the synagogues to argue with the pharisees i'm your god i'm your god the god you are worshiping he's in me he never did that what he did was he says you know the son can do nothing except the father revealed to him amen amen he says the son can do nothing except the father reveal it to him he was trying to help them to see that is the mighty god expressing himself kind of changed a little bit from wednesday night but that's the thing i was thinking about yesterday i said lord let it let this just now turn out to be you know a kind of a just just a good semi let it not just turn out to be a a mystical things just to get the people excited but let's realize that the reason why god has opened your eyes to see these things is because he wants to reveal himself he wants to express himself through you he wants you to be an ambassador of christ he wants you to represent him amen let your lie so shine that man will see your good work and glorify your father in heaven praise the lord amen i can read quotes to you this morning that will that will make the head to stand on your shoulder when brad branham talks about what god is doing in the church i mean the the position of the church and the things that he has ordained for us in this age when he says the body of jesus is just a memorial before the father the actual body is this body on earth that is the reason why when paul was persecuting the church he says paul why are you persecuting me saul why are you persecuting me because that was his body on earth amen that was his body on earth and those are some of the things what jesus was trying to tell the disciples you can say anything about the son of man it will be forgiving you he says but when he comes in the form of his church one word spoken against it because the church is a mystical body god brings us from different family he brings us from different background and sometimes from different church teachings and he brings us into this body amen and we need to grab that revelation to appreciate what his grace is doing in our life grab that revelation to appreciate you know what he's doing in our midst appreciate the people that he has put around us sometimes the way that we we are we get sometimes uh caught up in either in the national spirit or in a tribal spirit that's the same way sometimes we do with church we get stuck so so much to our our old church ways and all church belief is hard for us to to find ourselves being fruitful where god place us praise the lord as a son of god as a daughter of god no matter where you go and you find yourself among believers as a child of god you must be able to rightly fit in as a one that loved the lord the revelation of jesus christ that god gave unto him now the bride is the continuation of that revelation he's continuing continuing that revelation in our life when he has offered his soul as an offering for sin then he will see his seeds why because brother branham says all that god was he pulled into christ and all that christ was he pulled into the church on the dead of pentecost because that's word amen that's where his generation started from praise the lord amen because if we could just continue in the alliance that matthew chapter one gave us what will happen here is that we will get stuck because it will just go completely in the jewish lineage and you and myself will be left out praise the lord by the gen the generation of jesus christ he see the ones that he had brought forth by his own life by spilling his blood it's you and myself amen that's the reason why the church is made out of jews gentiles samaritans by one blood god save all men that's right those are the things that he was trying to tell the disciples i have some other sheeps that are not part of this fort i have to go by the way of samira praise the lord that's why he gave us a gentile dispensation because we are all from one father amen we are all can can find ourselves in the genealogy of jesus christ praise the lord you read it right there in matthew chapter one that is one of the place you will ever see it in a scripture where names of women were put in the energy knowledge it talks about tema it talks about rehab it talks about ruth it also talks about the wife of uriah's belt shiver and they were all gentile women praise the lord but they were placed there to show the mystery that is around this generation of jesus christ that is not just a jewish church it's not just a jewish generation it's a generation that will be made out of all people from around the world praise the lord amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the world was god let's just take another uh thought here to brother brennan hebrew chapter four we read a little bit of that look look like people could see that and that argue okay i have to close here certainly god is not three person if he is three god then we are hiddens which one is god they are all three one god is three offices of the same god he was the father in the form of the holy spirit the pillar of fire in the wilderness he was the son when he used the sonship office a little while and the world would see me no more i will go away i would come again and be with you even in you told the end of the world see he's the father who the sonship the holy ghost to is all the very same god working in three different offices father who sonship holy ghost saint john 5 7. now so over and over he's trying to help us to see one god manifesting in three offices that that we know amen but it was a great revelation like paul says great is the mystery of godliness it was a great revelation and it was not only for information but it was a revelation that should be laid through us a revelation that should be laid through us paul talks about the church coming to the image of christ just like christ was the image of god a revelation that should be lived through us to know that we have been purchased by his blood praise the lord to know that we are a son and daughter of god what what a greatest privilege we can have in the word what is the greatest calling that we can have but you see this age laudisha has reduced god to material things amen that the thing is the car that the drive that make them son of god or the house that they live in that make them children of god or how much money they have that make them children of god right it's the redemption it's what he is doing in our life amen the revelation of jesus christ that god gave unto him and he has given that revelation unto us unto the church amen you see that's that's the reason why right there in revelation chapter one brother peter referred that referred to that last uh last week and uh brother branham says when he stepped out of that pre-school office he took uh uh uh you know he took uh uh how you call it now his build and then he put it over his pipes at the first brother branham says he says that was christ in the bride form amen and then he took a father and he says that's christ in the priesthood office so it's that priest who offers that we are caught up to make intercession to bring daily sacrifice onto god daily sacrifice we can go every day bringing worship to our god praise the lord amen if we miss that church if we miss that if we miss the revelation of jesus christ that we are called to just like i said not just an understanding beautiful you understand you know that god god revealed it to you you can see it clearly but the purpose of that is for you to be the revelation it's for that revelation to live through you to be a witness in a dying world or to be able to reach out and bring other seeds of god because that's what the seed of god is attracted to is the revelation of jesus christ if your friend is a seed of god or your neighbor is a seed of god what they are attracted to is the revelation of jesus christ when he starts to see that revelation living out through your life this is why you are different there's something about you praise the lord amen well sometimes we we we we we quickly want to tell them about a prophet or we want to tell them about which church we go stone no tell them about the christ the christ that has redeemed you tell them about christ i was not born this way i i was not born this i've been saved god changed my life because if you're talking about a church they would just think that the church is abusing you because the church is robbing you from the society they were just think that the church is giving you a law oh i see you are dressing like that because of your church but if you tell them that god there's a god that has redeemed my life that god has changed me [Music] then they will see that revelation of jesus christ because that's where it starts from the seed of god brother branham says in in the revelation of jesus christ they are attracted to that revelation they know that no man can do this just like nicodemus said no man can do this they can realize that no young woman can do this in this age except god be with them don't realize that no young man can be like this no no couple can be like this except god be with him that's what nicodemus said he came by night he said master we know that you are from god because no man can do this except god be with him what he saw the revelation of jesus christ he saw the revelation of god in the body he knew that this thing that this man is doing is not a guesswork it's god that is with him and that revelation when when john wrote the book of first john the second john and ted john he just came from the island of patmos and he have seen all of the things you have seen the beast system he have seen the dragon he have seen everything but he have also seen the power that overcome in every age amen he's seen the power that overcome in every age every time the beast system rise up he saw the power that overcame he said young people is he that is in you the he that is in the world he says if you failed and you make mistakes we have an advocate don't stick there because your god is greater than your mistakes amen he says your god he says if our heart condemn us not we have faith with god he says but even if our heart condemns us god is greater than our heart since god is greater than our heart you are serving the mighty god there's a mighty god being revealed in you praise the lord amen no matter what you're going through no matter what what it seems like the thing that is pulling your heart to god the thing that is making you to to to to think about yourself and making you want to live for god more it has to be god amen we know for sure we are now what we supposed to be amen that's one thing we know for sure we are now what we're supposed to be because that is the thing that is encouraging us to press on to fight her because we know we are not what we are supposed to be but we also know that we're not what we used to be [Music] amen we know that we are not what we used to be and if we trust him he will make us what we we want to be amen oh praise the lord this morning amen amen musicians you can come for instead of making it a teaching service i just thought that i would go down this route you know because like i said there are just some few things i need to we need to talk about you know there are some few things that we need to talk about when god when a church or a family or an individual is experiencing the move of god and god is doing something in our life or god is doing something in our home or he's doing something in our church we have to watch over there or he's doing something in our work with god in our you know our individual life we have to watch watch with that you see because the devil that's what he fights again he fights against that life of god you know and in this little assembly we have seen things that have gone and come and sometimes you know we get to that place and and it feels like you know we are getting there and pretty soon the enemy sneaks in and then he starts to destroy the life of the church and one of the one of the way he can do it is to get the people visiting everybody gets busy and everybody gets over busy and nobody paying attention to anything we're not paying attention to our family life we're not paying attention to our children's lives we're not even paying attention to what is happening in church and then before you realize the church starts losing its value and pretty soon you can feed it in the people i mean they are not worshiping god they are now pouring out their hearts like it used to be it just become a form we come and sing uh uh 15 minutes 20 minutes tell a minute we call the preacher he come and bring us a good lecture and before we realize we praise the lord we thank god we go out and we go home and that enemy gets right in there and you start destroying the church life [Music] you start affecting the life of of the young people he's not finding a way to get in and destroy marriages [Music] jesus said to the disciples without me we can do nothing and that is the same in this age without us he can do nothing he need a bride he needed people that he can work through a people that would that would dedicate himself to the to the word of god to to the life of jesus christ [Music] young people it's something that we can be proud of it's something that we can be proud of we should be proud that we are sons and daughters of god we should be proud you don't have to go in a world and mess up your life before you experience the grace of god you don't have to go and mess up your life you don't have to you don't have to get yourself involved in things that you will regret about the rest of your life because you want to experience grace you don't have to you are having grace here just in the midst of everything that is happening the darkness that is over the world the perversion the filthiness if you as a young man and as a young woman can stay live truth to god's word that is the grace of god to you and you must be proud of that you must be thankful because that's they are not many that goes down that road that ever comes out and survive [Music] many young people take their own life because they just feel like it's useless to live what they thought they were getting their self in as a fun as little pleasure it has got a hold of them [Music] it has stuck on their life they can't break away from it they just thought that it was just i mean just taking taking a little smoke with a friend trying a little drug or getting themselves into some you know uh uh unclaimed movies and things like that but it have got a hold of them and they can't break away from it it's not how much you go close to the devil without sinning very branham says how far you can stay away because no matter how far you are he's still trying to get to you he said throwing things your way you don't have to go into the enemy camp [Music] praise the lord [Music] something try to do that he went into the camera of the enemy and god gave him victory he took it as a lifestyle he would lay down the word and think that well god will bring me out i will call on the name of the lord jesus he never realized that it was going to cause his eyes to come out he never realized that he was going to be standing between the poles one of these days [Music] to give his last last breath [Music] the revelation of jesus christ is not just a head knowledge it's something that is living in the brine [Music] let's buy our house together [Music] [Music] john said greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world [Music] [Music] we have to remember that was what pharaoh did to the to the egyptian i mean to the hebrews he increased their labor to rob them of the time to pray the time to sacrifice before god the time he he just increased their labor and people are just increasing their mind and increase in their desires of things that we want to do we are believing god to help us achieve these things but yet we are not committing ourselves to god we are not devoting ourselves to god you are serving the mighty god you are serving a god that created all things dominions and power the god that you are serving [Music] is a god that rules over the enemy [Music] don't let the devil tell you that this is your weakness don't allow him tell you that you know this little thing in your life [Music] maybe when i get married i will get over it no you are serving a god that can set you free right now you are serving a god that can break you away from it a god that can redeem you to himself as a veteran's bride he can redeem you to himself as a veteran's bride some people talk habits into their marriage and that very same habit because they never stood against it has destroyed their home whether it's a drinking habit or a lustful habit we are serving a god that can deliver a god that won't that that has redeemed us for us to be his image for him to express himself through us express his healing power through our life express his deliverance express giving us victory keeping smile on our face [Music] that's the revelation of jesus christ [Music] that is the revelation of jesus christ that is the thing that he want to do in our lives that is the reason why he has brought us all of this mystery the serpent seed the godhead internal security all of this mystery is to reveal himself is to empower this church this last this
