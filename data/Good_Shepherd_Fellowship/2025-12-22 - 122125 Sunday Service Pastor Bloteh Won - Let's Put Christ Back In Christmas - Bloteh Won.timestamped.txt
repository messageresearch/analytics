[34:59] all I have is yours. Every single breath
[35:07] I bring you more than a song. for the

[42:22] So we just thank the Lord for that. We
[42:24] are very grateful. So uh as we promised
[42:28] you uh we were to have a service the
[42:31] coming weekend but with everything the
[42:34] with with the heater and everything that
[42:37] was going on for some reason I was very
[42:40] hesitant. One of the reason I was
[42:42] hesitant to is because uh uh I was
[42:45] renewing my passport and it was not
[42:47] coming. So in my mind I thought okay I
[42:49] was I will be home and uh I would just
[42:53] let the brothers know to find someone
[42:54] else to take the meeting and so I would
[42:57] just write right standing in between
[43:00] there and then the heater came and uh uh
[43:03] uh so I would make sure that come every
[43:06] morning to make sure that uh there is no
[43:08] pipe that is bust and make sure that the
[43:11] heers were working and I got extra tool
[43:14] to add to what the trustees had just to
[43:17] make So the reason was we didn't want it
[43:20] the pipe to freeze. So uh uh and so
[43:24] right in the midst of that I just
[43:26] couldn't make any kind of a planning for
[43:28] us to have a weekend service next week.
[43:32] So I just I just took that off. I said
[43:35] well we will just have regular service
[43:37] even if I have to go uh brother Dan or
[43:40] or one of the brothers would take the
[43:42] service. And then uh so this coming
[43:45] Wednesday as we and there will be no
[43:48] service. We will stay keep it like that
[43:51] because we were going to have services
[43:53] on the weekend. We would not have a
[43:55] weekend service because we don't have a
[43:57] weekend speaker. But uh uh right in the
[44:01] midst of that uh brother brother Jason
[44:04] Deise uh uh send me a text message that
[44:08] he's in town. He moved to South Carolina
[44:11] and then later on I heard the move over
[44:13] to Canada to be with brother Eugene
[44:16] Brown. So I think he's bringing some
[44:18] folks from Canada over to the US for
[44:20] winter retreat and different things. So
[44:24] he contacted us that he will be around
[44:26] and he wanted to come around. He thought
[44:29] he would come today, but I just told him
[44:32] the other uh I know he's coming from
[44:34] Kennedy there, but uh we don't want to
[44:36] have a cold service like we did last
[44:39] week.
[44:41] So, he'll be preaching for us next
[44:43] weekend. We have him coming speak for us
[44:46] next weekend. I'll be gone and keep me
[44:50] in prayer. I have services Thursday,
[44:53] Friday, two on Saturday, two on Sunday.
[44:56] So uh just uh keep me in prayer and uh
[45:01] uh so uh there'll be no service on
[45:05] Wednesday night. We want to wish you all
[45:07] a merry Christmas. I think sister Ali
[45:10] brother gets back today. Yeah, he flies
[45:12] back today. Praise the Lord. So we pray
[45:15] that the Lord will give uh uh our decon
[45:18] safe travel back
[45:21] and uh so u
[45:24] uh
[45:26] and then the following Wednesday will be
[45:29] our all night service. That's what I did
[45:32] not want to forget. services will start
[45:35] at 900 p.m.
[45:38] which mean we will be seated at 900 p.m.
[45:41] Many times when I say services will
[45:43] start people ask me is it when we will
[45:46] sit or is it when the service will start
[45:49] as when we come through the door service
[45:52] starts. Praise the Lord. As soon as we
[45:55] come through that door we are in the
[45:58] service. Praise the Lord. We are asked
[46:01] to take our seats and pray and uh
[46:04] meditate, read something until the
[46:07] service uh uh the song service come up.
[46:11] So we'll be seated at 900 p.m. and uh we
[46:14] just want to
[46:17] uh uh be able to bring gratitude to the
[46:19] Lord. Uh uh I realized that the last all
[46:23] night service we had, we started an hour
[46:25] late and before we could get to the
[46:28] night, we were already starting to
[46:29] sleep. So uh uh if we can start at 900
[46:34] p.m. be seated and then go right into
[46:37] our our praise and thanksgiving. that we
[46:41] said uh uh you know uh we are all
[46:46] welcome to uh to sing a special or give
[46:51] a testimony
[46:53] and uh uh if you think your testimony is
[46:56] too long maybe you can you can write it
[46:59] down we'll read it for you amen praise
[47:01] the Lord we'll read it for you and uh so
[47:04] that's why we want to do the the upper
[47:08] Wednesday not this coming Wednesday but
[47:10] the following one will be the 31st. So
[47:13] uh uh and then uh uh that's that is the
[47:18] plan for uh the Wednesday service. I
[47:22] don't know if I'm forgetting anything.
[47:24] The all night service next week Sunday
[47:27] JC Mars will preach for us and uh that's
[47:31] what we want to do. So uh uh Sister Joy
[47:35] gave in a request uh for us to sing a
[47:38] song. What was the song you requested?
[47:43] Oh, come let us adore him. Amen.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; That's my favorite uh Christmas message.
[47:49] Praise the Lord. So, uh let's let's
[47:51] stand on our feet. We will sing that.
[47:54] And then uh uh I also wanted to sing uh

[1:01:59] were playing uh uh God's gift always
[1:02:03] find his place. That's why we were
[1:02:06] playing there today and next uh weekend
[1:02:10] uh for our our
[1:02:13] son school tape playing that we do.
[1:02:17] There is a portion of that uh service I
[1:02:20] want to play this morning just before we
[1:02:22] get into the message. So I ask uh uh the
[1:02:26] folks back there to just play that for
[1:02:28] us and uh uh it's a little story
[1:02:33] that uh
[1:02:35] a Christmas story
[1:02:37] and uh just few minutes of your time if
[1:02:41] you just want to follow with us this
[1:02:43] morning while we play that. Go ahead.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; I read a story
[1:02:49] come to my mind not long ago
[1:02:52] of something on that order. It was in a
[1:02:54] great city here
[1:02:56] in this nation and New York and it was
[1:03:01] on Christmas Eve and there was a poor
[1:03:04] family, a little daddy. He had TV and he
[1:03:08] was his wife had TV. They had been
[1:03:10] underprivileged
[1:03:12] and he he kind of he's weakly and so
[1:03:15] nobody would hire him. He had no
[1:03:17] education and he he people didn't want
[1:03:19] him. He just as an outcast to become a
[1:03:21] Just you know what a is
[1:03:24] just go by and pick up something and
[1:03:26] paddle it and get what they can. What
[1:03:28] little uh royalty they make on it. They
[1:03:31] try to live by just a like a peddler or
[1:03:34] something on the street. go buy some
[1:03:36] pins and needles and thimbles and
[1:03:38] whatever they can and and take it and
[1:03:41] and maybe buy them for a penny a pack
[1:03:43] and sell them for a nickel and make four
[1:03:45] cents on the pack. Maybe in a run of a
[1:03:47] day that's a great commission, but just
[1:03:49] think all he'd sell in a day. Maybe make
[1:03:52] 20 30 cents a day. and he had a family
[1:03:55] and
[1:03:57] the little wife being weakly she she
[1:04:00] died
[1:04:02] and it was coming Christmas time and the
[1:04:04] little girl she had developed from
[1:04:06] malnutrition not having the right food
[1:04:09] and things uh she took TV also and she
[1:04:13] had a little fella about 8 n years old
[1:04:17] 10 and she had never had a dog for
[1:04:22] Christmas and that's what she wanted for
[1:04:23] a gift was a doll.
[1:04:27] And the father not able to give her
[1:04:29] medical attention and so forth. And he
[1:04:32] he seen the little girl was going fast.
[1:04:35] And he tried his best to to to get
[1:04:38] enough money together to get her a doll
[1:04:41] for Christmas if he could just get
[1:04:43] enough to buy her a little doll. And so
[1:04:46] the
[1:04:48] Christmas time was coming on. The bad
[1:04:51] weather set in. The little girl
[1:04:53] developed some kind of a pneumonia and
[1:04:56] and she died just a few weeks before
[1:04:59] Christmas.
[1:05:01] And the father of course brokenhearted
[1:05:05] went to his little tin can and got the
[1:05:07] money out and he thought of his little
[1:05:09] girl and she wanted a doll like a little
[1:05:14] girl. See it's a little mother coming
[1:05:16] on. You notice how a little girl she
[1:05:17] goes to doll because she's that's her
[1:05:19] nature. She's a she's a coming mother.
[1:05:22] She will be mother someday she lives and
[1:05:25] everything northern nature. That's a
[1:05:27] little girl likes a little doll she want
[1:05:29] take care of because after all she she's
[1:05:31] a little potentially a little mother and
[1:05:35] she wanted a little doll. She never had
[1:05:37] one. Daddy had saved everything he could
[1:05:40] to get her a little doll. And so she
[1:05:44] died and the father kind of had a lapse
[1:05:48] of mind. his wife had been taking this
[1:05:50] little girl in his mind kind of got to a
[1:05:54] place that he still he go to bed every
[1:05:56] night and talked to this little girl
[1:05:58] though she was been buried but he
[1:06:01] thought he he was talking to her and
[1:06:02] tell her now honey it won't be long
[1:06:05] daddy's going to get you this dolly for
[1:06:06] Christmas and daddy's promised you the
[1:06:09] dolly and I I'm I'm going to get it
[1:06:12] finally Christmas arrive and of course
[1:06:16] you know how it is the rich had
[1:06:18] their their big parties and the candles
[1:06:22] burning and the great high masses in the
[1:06:25] churches and talking about Jesus and and
[1:06:29] so forth. The churches were going
[1:06:31] through all kind of routines of mass and
[1:06:35] singing and carols and everything.
[1:06:38] Little did they know what was going on
[1:06:41] back in the alley behind all this. this
[1:06:44] uh little fella back there and he got
[1:06:47] beside himself. He wanted that little
[1:06:48] girl to have that doll so bad cuz she
[1:06:50] had begged soul for this little doll.
[1:06:54] So he went out and he bought her a
[1:06:58] little rag doll, a little uh little
[1:07:01] thing probably about 30 cents, a little
[1:07:03] dirty something bought down on the side
[1:07:05] of the street. And it was a real cold
[1:07:08] night. the the blizzard winds are
[1:07:11] blowing, snow falling hard there in New
[1:07:13] York, out on the coast, the streets
[1:07:14] filling up and the people in their great
[1:07:18] big limousine, cars and drunken parties
[1:07:20] out drinking the celebration of the
[1:07:22] birth of Christ and of these things that
[1:07:26] we speak of tonight trying to think that
[1:07:29] that's the right way to do it is to
[1:07:31] drink off their old sorrows and things
[1:07:33] that that's the way to do it. call them
[1:07:35] stand in the store the other day and a
[1:07:36] woman talked about what two girls met
[1:07:39] who won't know what they got for their
[1:07:40] daddy and one of them said well she got
[1:07:42] him a carton of certain kind of
[1:07:44] cigarettes and the other said she got
[1:07:45] him a fifth of whiskey and a and a and a
[1:07:47] deck of car that ain't given a memorial
[1:07:51] gift for the birth of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:53] Christ and that's the way it goes you
[1:07:56] see it's just a big bunch of tinsel it
[1:07:59] hasn't got Christmas in it at all and so
[1:08:03] we find out this little man. He wandered
[1:08:06] along and he know his heart his little
[1:08:09] girl was gone, but he went and bought
[1:08:11] the doll anyhow. And he thought, I'll
[1:08:13] just start walking. I'll find her
[1:08:15] somewhere. She'll be along the street
[1:08:17] here and I'll find her. And he started
[1:08:20] walking. He he couldn't fool himself.
[1:08:21] She wasn't back there in a little shanty
[1:08:23] and in the little ragged dirty bed, but
[1:08:26] uh she was buried. So he he knew he
[1:08:30] thought he'd find her on the street. He
[1:08:31] said, "I'll just keep walking." And he
[1:08:34] going down through the alleys while they
[1:08:35] were singing their carols and going on
[1:08:38] and going down the alley packing this
[1:08:40] little dirty doll holded in his coat up
[1:08:42] to his heart, thinking of his little
[1:08:44] girl. And finally, a policeman happened
[1:08:48] to see him and policeman had a few
[1:08:50] drinks himself and he run into the alley
[1:08:52] and grabbed the old man and turned him
[1:08:54] around. He said, "What are you doing?
[1:08:58] Hang in here." He said, "I'm taking this
[1:09:01] little doll, sir, to my little girl." He
[1:09:06] said, "Where do you live?" And he told
[1:09:09] him, "Where you live?" He said, "Well,
[1:09:10] you're going away from that place.
[1:09:11] You're drunk. Go back the other way." He
[1:09:14] said, "Sir, I'm not drunk. I promise my
[1:09:16] little girl I' I'd get her a gift for
[1:09:19] Christmas."
[1:09:21] And said, "An appropriate gift for a
[1:09:23] little girl is a little doll." And he
[1:09:26] said, "Let me see it." So he showed him
[1:09:28] a little dirty rag doll is holding in
[1:09:32] his next to his bosom holding a little
[1:09:34] doll as he. So the policeman half drunk
[1:09:37] himself shoved him on and started down
[1:09:39] the old man went down the alley. Snow
[1:09:42] falling fast and
[1:09:44] well the midnight parties broke up. The
[1:09:48] next morning the snow had lit up. The
[1:09:50] sun had come out and so there was all
[1:09:54] the people from their great gay parties
[1:09:56] was ice sacks on their heads from too
[1:09:58] much drinking and celebration of the the
[1:10:00] birth of Christ. And and many of them
[1:10:03] were forced and caring all from all the
[1:10:06] going on way down in the alley.
[1:10:09] They found the old man
[1:10:12] and when he turned him over, he had a
[1:10:15] little doll next to his heart.
[1:10:18] I suppose he tuck his gift to him. He
[1:10:21] found her in a land not here,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; He he he tucked the gift. It was an
[1:10:26] appropriate gift.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; God merciful. Yet it cost him his death.
[1:10:32] There's no other way in the world he
[1:10:33] could have given her the gift. She was
[1:10:35] bearing it.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the only way he could do it
[1:10:38] was he go like that.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Little doll.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean too much. I guess a little
[1:10:49] dirty face doll. But it's what did he
[1:10:52] do? It fulfilled a promise he had made.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; No matter what the people thought about
[1:10:57] it, his dirty hands and a little dirty
[1:10:59] doll, but it fulfilled a promise to his
[1:11:02] little girl.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] Sometimes they look upon the gospel the
[1:11:07] same thing. They didn't want it when God
[1:11:09] brought it, but it fulfilled a promise.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; That he would give his son.
[1:11:16] You know what? They left him to die,
[1:11:18] too. Just like a on the street.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Exactly right. They left him to die like
[1:11:23] a on the street. And today, they
[1:11:25] treat him like a trap on the street.
[1:11:35] That's that's little story always moved
[1:11:37] my heart. Uh when you when you just
[1:11:42] think about it deeply
[1:11:45] uh
[1:11:48] very poor family
[1:11:51] didn't have anything. Wife was sick. She
[1:11:53] died
[1:11:57] time for Christmas.
[1:12:03] and he made a promise that he would get
[1:12:05] her
[1:12:07] little dog. No matter what
[1:12:10] uh
[1:12:12] type it was, he wanted to make sure and
[1:12:14] get it to her.
[1:12:17] And then while she was waiting for her
[1:12:19] little gift, she died also. But he kept
[1:12:22] his promise.
[1:12:25] He will work hard. He would do
[1:12:27] everything that it takes him to get the
[1:12:30] door. She wanted a door. I would get it
[1:12:33] for her.
[1:12:36] And he would lay down at night and and
[1:12:38] just speak. I will get you your
[1:12:41] daughter, whatever her name was.
[1:12:44] And uh
[1:12:54] and as we cancelled, you know, our our
[1:12:57] service on Wednesday night,
[1:13:00] praying uh hoping that we'll be able to
[1:13:03] uh spend time with our family and loved
[1:13:06] ones. I won't uh you know
[1:13:12] but uh
[1:13:14] just like I said the last time
[1:13:17] you know uh uh having a sense of valuing
[1:13:21] the people that God put around you
[1:13:25] sometimes is so easy we uh so common we
[1:13:29] get so used to one another
[1:13:32] that uh
[1:13:36] you know uh uh saying thank you,
[1:13:39] expressing a sense of appreciation
[1:13:43] that uh means a whole lot to us.
[1:13:50] Like sometimes people will say, "Well,
[1:13:51] they know that I love them because I
[1:13:53] gave them this, I gave them that, you
[1:13:56] know, u uh
[1:14:00] and not even having the strength to even
[1:14:02] express
[1:14:05] those words, I love you, looking the
[1:14:08] person right into the eyes and telling
[1:14:10] them I love you."
[1:14:13] And uh
[1:14:15] all of those things were, you know,
[1:14:17] those thoughts goes through my mind. You
[1:14:19] know, like Bram said there, you know,
[1:14:22] the rich, they hide their party, do
[1:14:24] whatever it is, but there were people
[1:14:26] down in the slums, you know, and I think
[1:14:29] it's the same today,
[1:14:31] you know, uh the homeless people and
[1:14:34] people dealing with different things.
[1:14:36] The same thing about us as as God's
[1:14:38] children. We all have need. Praise the
[1:14:42] Lord.
[1:14:43] But I pray that uh as we go into this
[1:14:47] season
[1:14:48] uh uh
[1:14:52] that God will make this uh this
[1:14:54] Christmas a little bit different to us
[1:14:58] uh for the fact that there he will give
[1:15:01] us the grace and give us the heart to be
[1:15:04] able to celebrate it in a special way
[1:15:08] more about the ones that are close to us
[1:15:11] than the things that we get for him or
[1:15:14] the things that he gave to us. Praise
[1:15:17] the Lord.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And just like that, daddy,
[1:15:21] even though his little girl was gone,
[1:15:23] but he tried to stay get his gift. Went
[1:15:27] in the cold and tried to find her to be
[1:15:29] able to give her this gift. And he died
[1:15:33] with with with trying. He died trying to
[1:15:36] get that gift to her because he promised
[1:15:39] her.
[1:15:41] May every one of us do the best that we
[1:15:44] can. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And uh bring uh
[1:15:51] in order of our lifetime that we try the
[1:15:54] best that we can to be able to give him
[1:15:57] the gift that uh he has given to us.
[1:16:00] With that being said, let's just stand
[1:16:02] to our feet and we will read a portion
[1:16:04] of the word this morning
[1:16:07] and then we find a little context here
[1:16:10] to speak to you with a few minutes that
[1:16:12] is left before us.
[1:16:14] Matthew chapter 2.
[1:16:20] Matthew chapter 2.
[1:16:36] Matthew chapter 2, we read from verse
[1:16:38] one.
[1:16:40] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[1:16:43] Judea in the days of Herod the king,
[1:16:46] behold there came wise men from the east
[1:16:50] of Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he that
[1:16:54] is born king of the Jews? For we have
[1:16:56] seen his side in the east, and I come to
[1:16:59] worship him."
[1:17:02] When Herod the king have heard these
[1:17:04] things, he was troubled in all Jerusalem
[1:17:07] with him. And when he had gathered all
[1:17:11] the chief priests and the scribes of the
[1:17:13] people together, he demanded of them
[1:17:17] where Christ should be born. And they
[1:17:19] said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea, for
[1:17:22] thus it is written by the prophet. And
[1:17:26] thou Bethlehem
[1:17:28] in the land of Judah
[1:17:31] are not the least among the princes of
[1:17:35] Judah. For out of the shall come a
[1:17:39] governor
[1:17:40] that shall rule my people Israel.
[1:17:44] Then Herod, when he have privately
[1:17:46] called the wise man, he inquired of them
[1:17:48] diligently what time the star appeared,
[1:17:53] and he sent them to Bethlehem, and said,
[1:17:56] "Go and search diligently for the young
[1:17:58] child. And when yay I found him bring
[1:18:02] him bring me a word again then I may
[1:18:06] come and worship him also.
[1:18:10] Then u when they have heard the king
[1:18:14] they departed and Lord the star which
[1:18:17] they saw in the east went before them
[1:18:20] till it came and stood over where the
[1:18:23] young child was.
[1:18:26] When they saw the star, they rejoiced
[1:18:28] with exceeding great joy.
[1:18:31] And when they were come into the house,
[1:18:34] they saw the young child, not the baby,
[1:18:38] but the young child, with Mary, his
[1:18:41] mother, and fell down and worshiped him.
[1:18:44] And when they had opened their treasure,
[1:18:48] they presented unto him gifts, gold,
[1:18:50] frankincense, and myrr.
[1:18:53] And being warn of God in a dream that
[1:18:56] they should not return to Herod, they
[1:18:58] departed into their own country another
[1:19:02] way. Amen. It's in John chapter 3.
[1:19:10] We will take uh
[1:19:13] one verse that is verse 16. St. John
[1:19:16] chapter 3:E1 16 and we will read it
[1:19:19] together.
[1:19:21] Let's read. For God so loved the word
[1:19:25] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:19:29] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:19:32] perish but have everlasting life. Let's
[1:19:36] pray. Father we have read your word Lord
[1:19:39] and we just want to ask that you will
[1:19:41] come this morning take a little uh
[1:19:44] context out of your word something oh
[1:19:46] God that will speak to us Lord Father.
[1:19:49] Oh God, father as we just go into this
[1:19:51] season that the entire word Lord Father
[1:19:54] God is commemorating Lord Father the
[1:19:57] birth of our Lord Jesus. Oh God we know
[1:20:01] uh we can we can tithe whatever we want
[1:20:03] to ti to it. But Father Lord what we
[1:20:06] want this morning is to just find that
[1:20:08] place in our heart. Oh God where we can
[1:20:11] be able to thank you for the gift that
[1:20:13] you give to this world. Father we love
[1:20:16] you. We appreciate you in Jesus name we
[1:20:19] pray.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have
[1:20:21] your seat.
[1:20:24] Amen.
[1:20:26] Just like I said, we can uh you know uh
[1:20:30] uh get in all of the the
[1:20:34] we can get in all of the the history of
[1:20:37] Christmas and you know uh the time and
[1:20:40] all of that. It does not matter this
[1:20:43] morning. And uh uh we can also pre
[1:20:48] message to show you where we stand with
[1:20:50] Christmas. It still does not matter this
[1:20:52] morning. What we want to do is to just
[1:20:55] be able to speak to you in a little way
[1:20:57] that uh whichever way that uh uh you
[1:21:01] choose to spend your Christmas. What I
[1:21:04] want to say to you is uh from uh this
[1:21:07] this quote that brother Brandon said
[1:21:08] here in the message.
[1:21:12] From the beginning, it was not so. He
[1:21:14] said, "I seen a little sign today when I
[1:21:16] was going to eat my breakfast down in
[1:21:19] the city. It said, "Put Christ back in
[1:21:22] Christmas." I thought, "Amen. That's
[1:21:25] good." Not only Christmas, but every
[1:21:28] day. Put Christ in your every day.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Put him back in the church. Bring him
[1:21:35] back to the earth again. Put him in
[1:21:38] action. Right?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Let the Christ of God stands in his
[1:21:43] church because he said, "I will be with
[1:21:47] you, even in you, to the end of the
[1:21:50] word."
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; So this morning, I speak to you, let's
[1:21:55] put Christ back in Christmas.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; No matter how you celebrate your
[1:22:00] Christmas, put Christ back in Christmas.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because I believe with
[1:22:07] all of the stuff, you know, when the the
[1:22:09] the the gift wrapping and everything
[1:22:13] that we try to get ourself, it's so it's
[1:22:17] so easy for us to forget the ones whose
[1:22:20] uh birthday we uh we are celebrating.
[1:22:23] Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; We try to make it ours. Sometime we
[1:22:28] forget that we were not born uh December
[1:22:31] 25th
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; and then we get offended of the gift
[1:22:34] that was born and then the thing that
[1:22:36] was born for me and whatever it is but I
[1:22:39] would say this morning let's pull Christ
[1:22:40] back in Christmas.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Whatever whichever way you spend your
[1:22:47] Christmas, let's pull Christ back in
[1:22:49] Christmas. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:52] So this morning I I take that little
[1:22:54] thought to speak to you and uh the past
[1:22:57] week we were talking about uh uh I don't
[1:23:01] know how I found myself there uh but all
[1:23:04] that my words were written in the book
[1:23:07] and I go to start talking about the book
[1:23:09] of life and the lamb's book of life and
[1:23:12] uh uh if you read back in Genesis you'll
[1:23:15] find that that uh the Bible speaks about
[1:23:18] the tree of life. Amen. The Bible speaks
[1:23:22] about the tree of life and we realize
[1:23:25] that that tree of life had one fruit and
[1:23:28] it was to give life. The fruit of that
[1:23:31] tree was to give life. Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; That's what it was called the tree of
[1:23:35] life. Now in the middle of the book we
[1:23:38] realize that uh Jesus said I am the
[1:23:41] bread of life. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh so uh uh uh I think uh the
[1:23:50] tree of life bear a fruit of life and
[1:23:53] that fruit of life became the bread of
[1:23:56] life.
[1:23:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; And in a way I would like to think about
[1:24:02] it is that the tree of life was cut down
[1:24:05] by the hands of men. When they when when
[1:24:08] when they put him on Calvary,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; when they hang him on a tree, they cut
[1:24:15] the tree of life down.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; But it's a tree that can die.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So all through the
[1:24:24] ages, the tree of life
[1:24:27] went through a process just like how men
[1:24:31] would take trees and and you know and
[1:24:34] and and and saw them and take them
[1:24:37] through process to be able to make
[1:24:39] sheets.
[1:24:41] The tree of life went through seven
[1:24:44] church ages and came out as the book of
[1:24:46] life.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It went through seven
[1:24:52] church ages and came out as the book of
[1:24:54] life. In Revelation chapter 5, the Bible
[1:24:57] says there was no man that was wanted to
[1:24:59] take the book to even look on it to read
[1:25:02] the book. No man could touch it.
[1:25:05] And I believe that that was the book of
[1:25:07] life.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] But then one of the others said, "John,
[1:25:14] there's a there's a there's a lion, the
[1:25:18] lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed
[1:25:20] to take the book and to loose the seals
[1:25:22] there are." And when John looked, he saw
[1:25:27] a lamb. He saw a bleeding lamb. And the
[1:25:31] lamb came and took the book from him
[1:25:35] that sat on the throne. And when the
[1:25:37] lamb took the book, the book that was
[1:25:40] the book of life became the lamb book of
[1:25:43] life.
[1:25:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That book became the lamb book of
[1:25:50] life because the lamb claimed the book.
[1:25:52] He broke the seals thereof. And then we
[1:25:55] will see it in Revelation chapter 10.
[1:25:57] The very same book that no man was
[1:26:00] wanted to touch. The lamb as the mighty
[1:26:03] angel this time give the book to the
[1:26:05] seven angel.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And the seven angel was promised to to
[1:26:14] reveal the mystery that was in that
[1:26:16] book. But uh what we will see in verse 8
[1:26:20] of Revelation chapter 10, the angel will
[1:26:24] give the book back to John
[1:26:27] and this time he would tell John to eat
[1:26:30] the book.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; To eat the book. So when if you just
[1:26:39] follow my little story this morning, you
[1:26:41] will realize that this the tree of life
[1:26:44] that was in the garden of Eden became
[1:26:47] the book of life.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; So we will realize that that tree was
[1:26:57] not a natural tree. That tree was a
[1:26:59] spiritual tree. That tree was Jesus
[1:27:02] Christ. Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why he could say,
[1:27:08] "I am the bread of life."
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And if the tree was Jesus Christ, the
[1:27:20] bread of life of Jesus Christ, then we
[1:27:23] will says the book of life is Jesus
[1:27:25] Christ.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, eat the book this morning.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Well, we thank the Lord for that.
[1:27:48] I saw this little thing as I was as I
[1:27:51] was uh uh just listening to a tape and
[1:27:55] uh and it it it it taught me something
[1:27:58] and I want to share that with you this
[1:27:59] morning.
[1:28:00] uh from from uh from the message 10
[1:28:02] virgins and uh the the the
[1:28:05] 144,000 Jews. Brother Bam said this it
[1:28:09] will hit it we hit red because he said
[1:28:11] this during during this time he said bad
[1:28:13] weather on the outside but all it is
[1:28:17] real good on the inside. Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; This is one time we can say is good to
[1:28:26] be on the inside looking out.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't it?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; To be on the outside looking in.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Now the principle, the thing that hit my
[1:28:39] mind when I read this is that is the way
[1:28:43] with election
[1:28:46] is different when you are inside looking
[1:28:49] out.
[1:28:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; When you are outside looking in,
[1:28:54] election don't looks like it's fair.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; It does not look that like it's fair.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; If you have not received the grace of
[1:29:07] God to understand God's election, it do
[1:29:11] not look like it's fair.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; But when you are inside looking out,
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; So, it is one time that we can say it's
[1:29:23] good to be inside.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm just trying I'm I'm
[1:29:33] trying to warm up my my my gear here.
[1:29:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; So, we want to we want to say Merry
[1:29:40] Christmas to you this morning. Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; We want to say Merry Christmas to you.
[1:29:45] And uh uh and as we remind oursel to
[1:29:48] keep Christ in Christmas, we want to uh
[1:29:51] just just come to you this morning with
[1:29:54] this little thought and uh uh you know
[1:29:58] and and and bring and bring something to
[1:30:00] you. As I as I was as I was uh thinking
[1:30:02] on what to speak on as as Christmas
[1:30:05] message uh uh sister text me and says
[1:30:10] she said, "Brother War, uh are you
[1:30:12] preaching a Christmas message on Sunday?
[1:30:15] Uh, she put me right on the spot. I
[1:30:17] said, "Well, okay." I said, "Yeah, I'm
[1:30:19] preaching a Christmas message on
[1:30:20] Sunday." She says, "Well, okay." And I
[1:30:22] said, "So, so you pray for me." Now, but
[1:30:25] this is what I was thinking about. Let
[1:30:28] me give you a little history.
[1:30:31] When Jesus, just like we read from the
[1:30:33] scripture,
[1:30:35] when Jesus was born, when he was born,
[1:30:40] there were three stars that constellated
[1:30:44] in the east. That's the reason why when
[1:30:47] you read Matthew chapter 2, it speaks
[1:30:50] about the child. It do not speaks about
[1:30:52] the baby.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Because when the wise men got to
[1:30:56] Jerusalem, he was no longer a baby.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; He was a young child.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; And to be definite, that was the reason
[1:31:08] why Herod demanded that the children
[1:31:11] should be killed from 2 years old down.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; If he was a baby, they will only kill
[1:31:17] babies.
[1:31:20] The Bible says he demanded of the wise
[1:31:22] men, you know, about this time. So they
[1:31:26] told him when they saw the star.
[1:31:30] So in his calculation, this should be
[1:31:32] about two years.
[1:31:35] Are we together?
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; That is something that we all are
[1:31:38] familiar with. It's not a new news. But
[1:31:40] uh uh uh uh uh this was a constellation
[1:31:44] of stars that that that came together.
[1:31:48] Now in 1962, there was something that
[1:31:51] happened. There was something that major
[1:31:54] happened on the earth just like what
[1:31:56] happened back there in Jerusalem. Amen.
[1:32:00] what happened in the east that brought
[1:32:02] these men to Jerusalem. So they took
[1:32:05] they had almost two years traveling with
[1:32:08] camels through the desert and whatever
[1:32:10] that they were coming from to be able to
[1:32:12] find this place they came uh uh followed
[1:32:15] the stars and as they followed the star
[1:32:18] the star brought them to Jerusalem as
[1:32:20] they were entering the city the star
[1:32:22] disappeared.
[1:32:24] If the star will stay there, they will
[1:32:26] have come and worship the child and Hera
[1:32:28] will know nothing and nobody will know
[1:32:31] anything.
[1:32:33] But the reason why
[1:32:35] they knew is because they couldn't see
[1:32:37] the start again. So they thought
[1:32:39] everybody should know where is he born
[1:32:41] king of the Jews. They say who are you
[1:32:43] talking about? We have only one king
[1:32:47] that's Herod
[1:32:50] or Caesar is the king. Herod is the
[1:32:52] governor. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh but this was a
[1:32:59] constellation of stars. And you know, I
[1:33:01] was thinking about this because this
[1:33:03] very promise of a star that is raising
[1:33:06] up was prophesied by the man called Bam.
[1:33:10] Yeah,
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; back in the book of numbers, Bam was the
[1:33:13] one that when he was hired by Balac to
[1:33:16] come and curse the children of Israel
[1:33:18] and he tried to do it and God would not
[1:33:20] allow him to do it when he couldn't even
[1:33:22] obey the angel and and a donkey have to
[1:33:25] speak to him. But this very man after he
[1:33:29] broke into the spirit and he realized
[1:33:31] that he couldn't curse these people and
[1:33:33] he started blessing them and he started
[1:33:36] PROPHESYING OVER THEM. HE WAS THE ONE
[1:33:38] THAT PROPHESIED A STAR will rise out of
[1:33:41] Jacob.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; And when you tell it about Bam through
[1:33:48] the scripture, there's a place where the
[1:33:50] Bible call him a soothsayer.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You tell it about Bam
[1:33:57] through the scripture, you will realize
[1:33:59] that Balam had a genuine gift, but he
[1:34:03] was not among the elected Jews.
[1:34:07] He was not a Hebrew but he had a gift.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; We cannot say that uh he was NOT GIFTED
[1:34:17] BECAUSE YI SAID A STAR HAS RAISED OUT OF
[1:34:20] JACOB. Y SAID THAT THESE WISE MEN SAW
[1:34:23] THE STAR THAT BROUGHT them to Jerusalem.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Jewel would talk about uh ham.
[1:34:34] Peter would talk about Balam went after
[1:34:37] reward and and and and and you just look
[1:34:39] through the scripture. You see, I was
[1:34:41] studying on Bum recently. I just looking
[1:34:44] through the the scripture and and and
[1:34:45] and and just and just trying to find out
[1:34:49] most of those things because uh uh uh
[1:34:52] when you look at the the the comparison
[1:34:56] of of gifted people in our age and and
[1:34:59] how people would come so close to say
[1:35:01] well this person can prophesy or this
[1:35:03] person you know uh they they had a gift
[1:35:07] and all of that you realize that in the
[1:35:10] very same time that Bam was was was
[1:35:13] there. Moses that met the pillar of fire
[1:35:16] was there. God didn't give him the
[1:35:18] vision concerning the star that were
[1:35:19] raised out of Jacob. God gave it to this
[1:35:22] man.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; It shows that God is sovereign.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; God could have given it to Moses for
[1:35:31] Moses to convince the people.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS SAME PILLAR OF FIRE THAT IS
[1:35:38] LEADING US ONE DAY WILL BECOME A STAR.
[1:35:44] It was given to Bam.
[1:35:46] Now, so the thing here was that the
[1:35:49] these stars came together. Three
[1:35:52] different stars. They came together and
[1:35:54] they formed a constellation. They they
[1:35:57] they line themselves. They line
[1:35:59] themselves in the heavens. And now these
[1:36:02] wise men saw the star and uh and and and
[1:36:06] the star minister to them to to each and
[1:36:10] every one of them. They got they got a
[1:36:12] they got a they got a message of
[1:36:14] whatever star that that reveal itself to
[1:36:17] them. So out of that they brought gift.
[1:36:19] But this is where I wanted to go with
[1:36:21] you this morning. in 1962.
[1:36:27] I think I think uh uh uh the beginning
[1:36:29] of the end of 1961,
[1:36:32] you know, uh uh uh science was
[1:36:35] prophesying of the lining of five stars.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:36:41] At the beginning of 1952,
[1:36:44] uh uh uh uh brother Ram started to talk
[1:36:47] about it
[1:36:49] that there is something about in the
[1:36:50] news about the lining of five stars. He
[1:36:54] it really never dawn on him what it
[1:36:56] meant at the time. Praise the Lord. But
[1:36:59] when he preached the message the end
[1:37:02] time
[1:37:03] sea sign,
[1:37:06] he would now bring that five stars into
[1:37:08] context.
[1:37:10] And the way he would do it is that he
[1:37:13] would give us uh an example that when
[1:37:17] Jesus
[1:37:18] was about to be born, when God was going
[1:37:22] to make himself in flesh in the ara,
[1:37:26] praise the Lord.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He he announc it by the lining of
[1:37:31] three stars in the heavens.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; I will come to my to my uh uh message in
[1:37:40] a few minute but I just I want to bring
[1:37:42] some information to you. These are
[1:37:43] information end time sea sign. Now
[1:37:46] listen closely. Don't fail to find this.
[1:37:49] Now before before the first coming of
[1:37:52] Jesus
[1:37:55] the the astronomer of of India they were
[1:37:58] watching the heavenly bodies and they
[1:38:02] said God always declared himself in in
[1:38:05] the heavenly body before he does in the
[1:38:07] earth before he does anything. They said
[1:38:11] why? When this the three wise men went
[1:38:14] to worship the king that was to rule the
[1:38:17] earth, a baby king that they follow a
[1:38:20] star. Your scripture said uh uh uh he
[1:38:24] said but frankly these was three stars
[1:38:27] that comes together and made one star.
[1:38:31] The the Christian astronomer that I was
[1:38:33] talking to or the magist said that means
[1:38:37] that there were three race of people
[1:38:42] that this man died for.
[1:38:46] The only three race there is is Ham,
[1:38:50] Shem and Jeff. Amen
[1:38:54] people. And uh uh when his gospel was uh
[1:38:59] uh has has been preached to Ham, Shem
[1:39:01] and Jezra people, they come together in
[1:39:04] his gospel, then the return will be. Are
[1:39:08] we together?
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Three is a number of perfection. But
[1:39:12] what do what do I do believe that three
[1:39:15] was? What do I do believe it was? It was
[1:39:19] a three of perfection showing there the
[1:39:21] trinity of God, father, son, and the
[1:39:23] holy ghost was made manifest in a man,
[1:39:27] Jesus Christ, the one perfect man.
[1:39:31] Listen now close. When when the when the
[1:39:34] little baby Christ was born, three stars
[1:39:36] went together to make one morning style
[1:39:40] that reflected the coming of an infant
[1:39:45] Christ,
[1:39:46] a perfect one.
[1:39:48] Are we together?
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Now what happened? We see a rolling in
[1:39:54] the paper across the television out
[1:39:58] across the nation where five stars just
[1:40:01] fell in line with the word. What is
[1:40:05] five? The number of grace.
[1:40:07] Every time those stars comes then
[1:40:10] something happened on the earth. What is
[1:40:13] taking place? Five stars fell and and uh
[1:40:16] uh uh
[1:40:19] introducing of what what's happened now.
[1:40:23] So this is what I want I want I want to
[1:40:25] bring you now as I as I read this
[1:40:27] information to you. So this is this is
[1:40:29] back in 1962. Now he's saying this to us
[1:40:32] that there were there were the lining of
[1:40:34] these stars. We saw you know the eclipse
[1:40:36] and all of these things that been
[1:40:38] happening in recent times. But this now
[1:40:41] he's over the years he he was able to
[1:40:44] grasp it in comparison
[1:40:47] to just like how when our Lord Jesus was
[1:40:52] going to be born a h God was going to
[1:40:56] come in flesh in the infant. He uh he uh
[1:40:59] he announced it by the lining up of
[1:41:02] three stars. Now something also begin to
[1:41:05] happen back there where five star is
[1:41:08] lining. What is this all about? That's
[1:41:10] what he's trying to tell us.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Now, think about it. Now, uh uh uh uh as
[1:41:16] as believers,
[1:41:18] 1963
[1:41:20] was the opening of the word.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; 1963
[1:41:30] will be a birth.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:36] When the Omega church was going to be
[1:41:39] born, God announced it
[1:41:43] by three stars.
[1:41:45] The Alpha Church. Sorry, I get my thing
[1:41:48] all messed up. The Alpha Church. Now,
[1:41:51] the Omega
[1:41:53] also now is being announced by the
[1:41:56] lining of five stars.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. These are information that follow
[1:42:04] me a little bit. I don't want to lose
[1:42:06] you now. So what what is happening here
[1:42:08] is that uh uh uh this is what this is
[1:42:13] what he says. Let me let me read read
[1:42:15] down a little bit here. What's
[1:42:17] happening? An infant church. Hallelujah.
[1:42:21] A bride infancy
[1:42:24] that the power of God has be to fall on
[1:42:28] her. She is taking form.
[1:42:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; This is 1962
[1:42:37] before the seals were even open.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; He's announcing that uh an infant church
[1:42:45] is beginning to be born. The word, the
[1:42:49] fullness of the word is going to come
[1:42:52] again to
[1:42:55] a people.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE HOW THE FULLNESS OF THE word
[1:43:03] came to the people in Jesus,
[1:43:06] the fullness OF THE WORD NOW with the
[1:43:09] opening of the seal because that's
[1:43:10] that's what make the fullness. We know
[1:43:12] that every church age had a message.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the opening of the seals was
[1:43:19] to tie the loose ends of the seven
[1:43:22] church ages.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; And now it's announcing that another
[1:43:30] another infant is is is will be born.
[1:43:37] THIS THE WORD IS GOING TO BE BORN.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; But this TIME IS NOT GOING TO BE IN A

[1:44:40] WILL TAKE A PEOPLE. THEY WILL NOT BE THE
[1:44:42] BEST PEOPLE BUT THE WORLD WILL BE BORN
[1:44:45] IN THEM.

[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, an infant church
[1:47:41] was born.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[1:47:47] SEVEN of five stars. SPEAKING ABOUT THE
[1:47:51] GRACE OF GOD THAT WILL PICK UP A PEOPLE
[1:47:53] IN THIS generation
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; and God will make himself known to them.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; The world will not believe much of our
[1:48:02] of our story.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE JOSEPH AND
[1:48:07] MARY.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; OH, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT THAT WAS SAID
[1:48:11] ABOUT THE YOUNG WOMAN,
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; what did she do?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; What did she do? By the grace of God,
[1:48:17] she tried to keep herself.
[1:48:21] She keep herself. IT WAS GOD THAT
[1:48:23] INTERRUPTED her life.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; The same God that interrupted your life.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; SHE HAD HER PLAN. SHE HAD WHAT SHE
[1:48:33] WANTED TO DO, HOW MANY CHILDREN SHE
[1:48:35] WANTED TO BORN.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For that purpose, she
[1:48:40] kept herself.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; But almighty God came down and
[1:48:43] interrupted her life.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, I'M GLAD HE INTERRUPTED MY
[1:48:50] LIFE.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. I'M SO GLAD HE
[1:48:53] INTERRUPTED MY life
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; because he has GAVE ME MORE MEANING to
[1:48:58] live.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; That is better than whatever I was
[1:49:01] pursuing. I'M SO GLAD he interrupted my
[1:49:03] life. I don't know about you, but I'm so
[1:49:06] glad
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; that he interrupted my life.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:21] Hallelujah.

[1:49:31] this and comparing it to the first
[1:49:32] coming and the second coming. Amen. It's
[1:49:35] first coming and the second coming.
[1:49:38] Amen.
[1:49:40] I might leave you. I might just suspend
[1:49:42] you in in some thoughts here, but praise
[1:49:45] the Lord. I might just suspend you in
[1:49:48] some thoughts here, but uh uh we allow
[1:49:50] the Lord to have his way. Amen.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; There just so much confusion about the
[1:49:58] coming of the Lord, whether he has come
[1:50:00] or whether he has not come. Praise the
[1:50:02] Lord. And and and and sometimes we get
[1:50:05] so caught up in all of those things that
[1:50:07] we don't see what is happening.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we don't see what is
[1:50:13] happening. Brother Brandon says, "I
[1:50:15] believe in a literal coming of the Lord
[1:50:17] Jesus."

[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; He said it.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; But he make us to know that that coming
[1:50:23] is not for his feet to touch this earth.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; That literal coming, his feet will not
[1:50:31] touch this earth.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; But there is another coming.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; There's another coming that's pertaining
[1:50:40] to you and myself.
[1:50:42] It is the breath of that coming that I
[1:50:44] want to announce to you this morning.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; How that coming came to be
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; just like how it came to being in
[1:50:51] Jerusalem.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When God took a manger,
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; he took a despised place.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; He was robbed in swollen cloth.

[1:51:33] crying and and and and and all the
[1:51:36] animals sticking their heads
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; over to see where the noise is coming
[1:51:40] from.

[1:53:17] creed and and whatever they will be
[1:53:19] carrying on in and they are going to
[1:53:21] miss it.

[1:54:48] infant church. Hallelujah. Had a bride
[1:54:51] infant shape that the power of God has
[1:54:54] beginning to fall on her. The power of
[1:54:57] God started falling on her since the

[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; the power been coming in measure

[1:55:16] the power will fall when God sent a
[1:55:19] messenger to condition the church to
[1:55:21] move to to the next age.

[2:01:17] VALUE your revelation, watch your life.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Because revelation is not something you

[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; and and and they cannot challenge their
[2:01:41] life with the word of God.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; IT DOES NOT LINE UP WITH the word of
[2:01:44] God.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; As a son of God, as a daughter of God in

[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; By the way, I spoke to brother Andre

[2:02:16] last time just came from from Uganda.
[2:02:20] Uh uh I mean such a such an outpouring
[2:02:23] there. The Lord really gave him
[2:02:25] wonderful blessing. I would I don't know
[2:02:27] what is happening but it looks like
[2:02:28] there is just some kind of a move there.
[2:02:31] Uh uh he told me almost about uh it say
[2:02:34] 1,000 or 10,000 Bibles you know they
[2:02:37] gave out to those uh somewhere in the
[2:02:40] interior uh to all of these uh uh
[2:02:43] denomination of people and just for the
[2:02:45] fact of these people you know receiving
[2:02:48] Bibles for the first time it just it
[2:02:50] just broke out something among them.

[2:03:45] the word.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; If your life is not mashing with the
[2:03:50] word, you better challenge what you
[2:03:51] believe.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Tell yourself that this thing I'm
[2:03:54] believing is not producing Christ.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; It's not producing Christ. It's making
[2:03:59] me to backslide. I need to do something
[2:04:01] about it.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What kind of Christ you
[2:04:05] have? It don't give you prayer life. You
[2:04:07] don't have a devotion. You don't have
[2:04:09] commitment. You don't have a
[2:04:11] consecration. What kind of a Christ is
[2:04:13] there? Yeah.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Walking at Christ, you sleep on.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; The church is coming for God is going to
[2:04:34] have a church with us. Father Rinko, she
[2:04:37] is predestinated.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; God says so he will have it. That makes
[2:04:42] it right. No matter what anybody said,
[2:04:44] God said it. It's in his word.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; That he will have a church without spot
[2:04:49] or wrinkle.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; It's not a man word. It's God's word.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; The same GOD THAT SAID A VIRGIN SHALL
[2:04:58] CONCEIVE.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; And he conditioned THE VIRGIN AND HE GOT
[2:05:02] THE VIRGIN AND THE VIRGIN CONCEIVE.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; That same God is saying you will have a
[2:05:07] church without spot or wrinkles. Amen.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; It will do you much better for you to
[2:05:15] start believing God's word and taking
[2:05:17] God's word and and applying God's word
[2:05:20] than to you be making making complain on
[2:05:22] your excuses because the church will be
[2:05:24] without spot or wrinkle.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; If your weaknesses is a spot, look away
[2:05:29] from it
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; because it's not going to be part of
[2:05:32] theirs.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Look away from it. Look to the promise
[2:05:38] of God. Yes.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord God, you said this and I know
[2:05:41] you can bring it. You can bring it in my
[2:05:43] life.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; If you could BE BORN IN A MANGER, YOU
[2:05:48] can be born in my life.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; You can be born in my heart.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's just take something yet
[2:06:01] again and then uh uh we'll see how we
[2:06:04] can uh continue to tell you. Merry
[2:06:06] Christmas. God's gift always find its
[2:06:08] place.
[2:06:11] Yeah.
[2:06:13] Here's uh only one gift that you can
[2:06:15] give and that is yourself.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to God
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; because God already gave you.
[2:06:27] Amen. He gave you his gift.
[2:06:33] Praise the Lord. Man, there is only one
[2:06:36] thing you owe him back and and that's
[2:06:39] yourself to him.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; And I think that's what this Christmas
[2:06:45] must mean to us.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Just like that father promising his
[2:06:52] child a gift.
[2:06:55] He didn't mind if he was called,
[2:06:58] he rather die trying
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; to bring that gift to his daughter.
[2:07:03] He died in a cold trial
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; to be a loving father.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; He might have failed many times.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Do you know that's the same thing that
[2:07:16] the Apostle Paul did?
[2:07:19] Because he witnessed the death of of
[2:07:22] Stephen.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:27] He cancelled marriage and family life
[2:07:29] from his life.
[2:07:32] He say I took the life of one. I will
[2:07:34] give my life. Whatever it takes,
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; I will die preaching Christ.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; I will give my life.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Or we might make mistakes as fathers and
[2:07:50] make mis mistake to our spouses. But I
[2:07:52] mean at a certain time you must grab
[2:07:54] yourself and says let me try again
[2:07:56] because God is the God of second chance.
[2:07:58] If he has given me second chance, LET ME
[2:08:00] DO THE BEST that I can.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Let me die trying to be a better father.
[2:08:07] Let me die trying to be a better son of
[2:08:09] God, a better daughter of God, A BETTER
[2:08:12] WIFE, A BETTER HUSBAND.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; This is not about church membership.
[2:08:21] It's about Christ the word.
[2:08:29] Are we together?
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; That is the only gift that you can give
[2:08:33] him is to give him yourself.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to God because he has
[2:08:37] already given you his gift.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; That's the only one thing you owe God
[2:08:42] and that is yourself.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; So all your Christmas hat, your
[2:08:47] Christmas jacket, your Christmas shoes
[2:08:49] that you buying it for yourself.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:54] How can you buy a gift for yourself on
[2:08:56] somebody birthday?
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's let's just go ahead.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Watch the gift they brought him.
[2:09:08] Identify what they thought he was.
[2:09:12] Amen.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; That is the gift of the three wise men.
[2:09:16] They give identify
[2:09:19] what they thought he was. Praise the
[2:09:22] Lord.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; They brought him gold, frank incense and
[2:09:27] my gold is deity. Frank incense speak of
[2:09:30] service
[2:09:31] and murd is death. God deity in service
[2:09:36] to die.
[2:09:38] For what? Deity in service of God for
[2:09:41] death.
[2:09:43] Jesus was deity in service for death to
[2:09:47] redeem the word.
[2:09:50] But what did the word do? They refuse
[2:09:53] it.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; They reject it. And I say there to us
[2:09:58] today, the thing that we bring to him
[2:10:02] identify what our thought is about him.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Not the thing we bring to church, the
[2:10:11] thing we bring to him.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Our attitude to him.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:21] The thing we bring to him shows our
[2:10:24] thoughts
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; about him.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand what I mean? If you
[2:10:30] believe with all of your heart, every
[2:10:32] word of God,
[2:10:35] you uh identify it by giving all that
[2:10:40] you have to it.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; All that you have to eat. I I tell you,
[2:10:48] I You know when when the moment you
[2:10:50] start to talk about giving, the first
[2:10:52] thing that comes to people mind is
[2:10:54] money.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I you know I had a a friend a
[2:11:00] coworker at work and one time uh uh you
[2:11:02] know we were talking he says he says man
[2:11:04] when I when I realized that uh you know
[2:11:08] uh all the offering they were not
[2:11:10] sending it to heaven I stopped giving.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said sir but whoever taught you
[2:11:17] that they use our currency in heaven.
[2:11:21] Who taught you that?
[2:11:23] You say yeah that thing you know because
[2:11:25] just being from small you know you know
[2:11:28] you know
[2:11:30] you know his mom is a preacher you know
[2:11:32] mom will carry on to church but that
[2:11:34] thing just hit me when I realized that
[2:11:36] they were not sending the money to
[2:11:37] heaven.
[2:11:40] I said, "Well, but did you ever thought
[2:11:43] how they were paying the bills,
[2:11:46] how they were sustaining the church?
[2:11:49] You ever thought about that?" Well, no,
[2:11:52] I didn't think about that. Well, yeah,
[2:11:54] because that is the first thing. But I
[2:11:56] would tell you this morning because I
[2:11:58] can take you back to Deuteronomy,
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; you know. And what Deuteronomy says that
[2:12:02] even your even your offering
[2:12:06] must be brought to the place where God
[2:12:08] will put his need.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; That's what it says.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Your tithe and offering must be brought
[2:12:15] to the place where God will will put his
[2:12:18] need.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so you will realize that uh
[2:12:26] if a man if a man was not uh uh uh in
[2:12:31] order with H HIS LIFE was not in order,
[2:12:35] he could not even bring a sacrifice.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; So you see it's is it's A PRINCIPLE TO
[2:12:46] SHOW US THAT GOD WANT OUR LIFE before
[2:12:49] what we give.
[2:12:51] Amen.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[2:13:35] BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MUCH OUR ECONOMY
[2:13:38] is and how much money we have, IF YOU
[2:13:40] HAVE A REVELATION THAT GOD IS IN
[2:13:42] CONTROL, YOU HAVE A REVELATION that he
[2:13:44] is MY PROVIDER. YOU HAVE A REVELATION
[2:13:47] THAT THE BIRTH THAT I BRING, HE gave it
[2:13:49] to me, then I can BELIEVE THAT
[2:13:51] EVERYTHING THAT CONCERN ME, he he will
[2:13:53] take care of it.

[2:14:46] some of the ridiculous thoughts about
[2:14:49] church. Some of the things that we will
[2:14:51] not do at our work,
[2:14:54] we expect it to be done in church.
[2:14:57] You will not stay home from work without
[2:14:59] telling your supervisor.

[2:15:16] Malachi rebuked the people of.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The thing that you
[2:15:20] WILL NOT DO TO YOUR GOVERNOR,

[2:15:24] of God.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; It just show the kind of a poor
[2:15:27] revelation you have.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; You know people think that church is a
[2:15:31] club that we need you. We don't see the
[2:15:34] sense that
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; you know we need God,
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; You think that the church need you so we
[2:15:39] must be begging you. We must be we must
[2:15:41] be running after you. Oh, we didn't see
[2:15:43] you in church today. I mean, when are
[2:15:46] you coming to church? What kind of a
[2:15:48] church is that
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; preacher brother? Come on.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Stay away from work one week. Don't tell
[2:15:59] your supervisor.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Stay away one week. Don't tell your
[2:16:06] supervisor.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; No. BUT YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS
[2:16:12] THAT BECAUSE you think your LIFE DEPEND
[2:16:15] ON the work.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Your life don't depend on church. That's
[2:16:18] the way you think.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; But you get it reverse.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; You get it reverse. You are driving your
[2:16:25] car in reverse.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:35] the things we bring to him. It shows the
[2:16:38] thoughts that we have about him.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[2:17:58] all the thing that Facebook is feeling
[2:18:00] us with.

[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; When we begin we when we start to have
[2:18:34] the revelation that this is God's
[2:18:37] community on earth, let me tell you, you
[2:18:40] don't come to church to serve God.
[2:18:44] No, there is nowhere in the Bible where
[2:18:48] the Bible say come to church to serve
[2:18:50] God.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:18:54] Paul said, "Don't forsake the assembly
[2:18:56] of yourself together."
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; We come to encourage ourself.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; We come to share our burdens and pray
[2:19:09] for one another. That's what church is
[2:19:11] for. You serve God when you are out
[2:19:14] there.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; That's where you serve God.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; When you serve people, the way you live
[2:19:19] with people,
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; the way you treat people, the way you
[2:19:22] think about people in the street,
[2:19:34] Are we together?
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; We come to churches say, "Brother
[2:19:38] Johnny, you can do it no matter what

[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Just just so we encourage one another.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why when you come
[2:19:48] to church, you see certain brothers, it
[2:19:51] lift up your heart. If a person was
[2:19:53] coming all the time, you don't see them.
[2:19:55] It it throw what's wrong? What's wrong
[2:19:57] with this brother? You know, it it throw
[2:19:59] that thing in your mind. You're thinking
[2:20:00] what's what's going on with this person?
[2:20:02] You think about it that way. Why?
[2:20:04] Because our coming together encourage us
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; that we are in this together.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Because right here, every one of us in
[2:20:14] our best behavior. How are we serving
[2:20:16] God? You're sitting quietly. I'm doing
[2:20:18] the talking.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; So, how are you serving God?
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; How are we serving God? It's out there.
[2:20:25] When you go through those doors,
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; the way we relate to the people around
[2:20:31] us,
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; like a prophet would say, when you serve
[2:20:40] your husband, you are serving God. When
[2:20:42] you serve your wife, you are serving
[2:20:43] God. When you serve your children, you
[2:20:45] are serving God. Hallelujah.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the apostle Paul
[2:20:52] would says when you are working he says
[2:20:55] do your job as unto the Lord.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; AT WORK DO IT AS unto the Lord.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Don't do it only I just here for the
[2:21:04] paycheck.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; I'm just here for the paycheck.
[2:21:12] If it were that because of the paycheck,
[2:21:13] I would have left this place.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's not a that's not a Christian
[2:21:19] attitude.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible says as unto the Lord, serve
[2:21:23] your master as unto the Lord.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT'S HOW OUR SERVICE TO God is.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Merry Christmas.

[2:25:09] But this infant church is already here
[2:25:11] on earth. People
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; this was announced 1962 1963. The seals
[2:25:18] were open. The revelation came out. I
[2:25:20] mean even the people in the tabernacle
[2:25:22] were not even understanding this that
[2:25:24] brother Brandham was preached. But this
[2:25:25] this has lingered out and here we are.
[2:25:28] Here we are.
[2:25:32] Is the revelation, the revelation of
[2:25:35] Jesus Christ. We sing that song over and
[2:25:38] over. Something keeps holding me.

[2:26:07] but HE'S NOT CONSIDERING THAT SHE'S dead
[2:26:11] because he made a promise.

[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:26:59] If there's one thing that this Christmas
[2:27:03] must taught us,
[2:27:05] he went to Calvary,
[2:27:07] DIED TRYING HIS BEST to convince us that
[2:27:12] there's a land beyond the river.
[2:27:15] HE DIED TRYING HIS best
[2:27:20] to let the world know that he is he was
[2:27:22] the gift of God.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; For God so loved the word that he gave
[2:27:26] his only begotten son.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; You see, when the wise man saw the star,
[2:27:36] let me close with this. I'm closing. But
[2:27:39] Dick say I say I'm closing. I didn't say
[2:27:42] I close. I'm closing. Praise the Lord.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; The wise men
[2:27:48] they brought their gifts that identify
[2:27:52] their revelation. When those five stars
[2:27:55] were lined up,
[2:27:57] GOD ALSO LINED UP FIVE supernatural gift
[2:28:02] for us. THE FIVE SUPERNATURAL THINGS
[2:28:05] THAT WILL happen at the opening of the
[2:28:07] word
[2:28:09] speaking scor into existence.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. PRAISE THE LORD.

[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:38] THEIR FATHER DIED AND AND THE DIFFERENT
[2:28:41] THINGS that they went through. You know,
[2:28:42] you think about that people. Let me tell
[2:28:44] you, there are a lot of things that
[2:28:46] happen around church
[2:28:51] that if we will ever make it, it will be
[2:28:53] the grace of God.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; It will be the grace of God. THE SAME
[2:28:59] GRACE THAT SAVED us will be the same
[2:29:01] grace that would take us from here.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; THOSE BOYS TRYING TO HELP THEIR FATHER
[2:29:07] IN THE FIELD AND THEY WATCH a tractor
[2:29:09] run over him. I BELIEVE THEY CRY, "OH
[2:29:12] GOD, SAVE DADDY. OH GOD, SAVE DADDY."
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; You know, SOMETIMES WHEN YOU NEED GOD,
[2:29:18] THE THE THE MOMENT THAT THAT THE TIME
[2:29:20] THE DESPERATE need you have for God,
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; it looks like WHEN HE DON'T SHOW UP AT
[2:29:28] THAT TIME, it looks like he does not
[2:29:29] exist.
[2:29:31] It throw them into
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; a place where they didn't wanted to hear
[2:29:37] nothing about God.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; Talk about a prophet, they laugh about
[2:29:41] it. Sometime those things happen in
[2:29:44] church.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; It happen in church.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; People go through things.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; If you are not there yet, don't don't
[2:29:55] don't think that it does not happen or
[2:29:57] it will not happen to you.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; People go through things that throw them
[2:30:03] in some form of depression or another,
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; especially our young people.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE THE
[2:30:13] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS STRIPPING THEM OF
[2:30:15] ALL THEIR YOUTHFULNESS,
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T HAVE FRIENDS, THEY CAN'T HAVE
[2:30:19] THIS, THEY CAN'T HAVE THAT, AND WE BASH
[2:30:22] THEM AND BASH THEM AND BASH THEM.
[2:30:25] It gets to a place sometimes a trick of
[2:30:28] their mind
[2:30:31] and it gets into a cycle. It does not
[2:30:33] mean that they are lost
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; but they get confused.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; They are trapped.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THOSE BOYS WERE GOING
[2:30:49] THROUGH.
[2:30:55] They saw their father dying right right
[2:30:58] before their eyes.
[2:31:02] THE BREAD WINNER OF THEIR HOUSE,
[2:31:05] the man that was supposed to lead him to
[2:31:07] manhood.

[2:31:20] him. WHEN SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY.
[2:31:23] ASK WHAT YOU WILL.

[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; A PROPHET OF GOD SAY, "ASK WHAT YOU
[2:31:29] WILL." YOU ASK FOR MONEY. IF IT DON'T
[2:31:31] DROP ON YOUR LAP,

[2:32:34] word for a little fish.
[2:32:37] He says he says the the little things in
[2:32:40] our lives

[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:33:46] YOUR MIDST.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; WE ARE SERVING A LIVING GOD,
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; NOT A DEAD ONE.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; He's a living God.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; He's real.
[2:34:03] He's real and he's in our midst.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; My my my
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have a I have a little story
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; and every time I think about that story,
[2:34:26] it puts my mind to the place and
[2:34:28] sometimes I use that many times to to
[2:34:32] talk to people.
[2:34:36] YOU SEE THE MESSENGER OF THE FIRST
[2:34:38] COMING OF THE LORD JESUS,
[2:34:41] John the Baptist, that was a second
[2:34:44] curse into Jesus.
[2:34:47] That man
[2:34:49] Jesus SAID OF EVERY MAN THAT IS BORN OF
[2:34:52] WOMEN.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; There was none like John the Baptist.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; John never had an easy people.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; WHEN I THINK ABOUT JOHN THE BAPTIST
[2:35:03] LIFE, JOHN WAS BORN IN A time his
[2:35:06] parents were already old.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; He was born IN A TIME HE WAS BORN RIGHT
[2:35:11] INTO SCANDER.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE MARY IS SAYING THAT SHE
[2:35:15] HAS SEEN an angel IS BECOMING A SCANDAL
[2:35:18] AROUND THE Sanhedrin's council.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; JOHN FATHER HAS SAVE THE CHURCH.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why sometimes church
[2:35:27] without God
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; can be wicked
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; to the people that served them.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE MUST PUT CHRIST
[2:35:36] IN CHRISTMAS. WE MUST BRING CHRIST BACK
[2:35:39] TO THE CHURCH. WE MUST PUT CHRIST in our
[2:35:41] home. Yes.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you have a church without Christ,
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; you will feed it.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; HE HIS FATHER SAVED THE CHURCH. THE
[2:35:53] BIBLE SAID HE WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN.
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; HE WAS AT HIS POST OF DUTY.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; GOT THE PLACE READY. HE SENT THE PLACE
[2:36:03] BEFORE THE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO CHURCH.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[2:36:08] WHEN ZACHARIAS WAS CONNECTED TO MARY,
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; when he was connected to Mary,
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN JOHN WAS BORN, ZACHARIAH TONGUE WAS
[2:36:19] LOOSE
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; TO TELL THE PEOPLE THAT IT WAS AN ANGEL.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; THEY ALREADY HAD A PROBLEM WITH A GIRL
[2:36:27] SAYING AN ANGEL MEET HER. NOW SAY
[2:36:30] ZACHARIAH HAS PUT HIMSELF IN THE
[2:36:31] SCANDAL.
[2:36:36] JOHN NEVER SAW THE GLORY OF HIS father
[2:36:38] ministering
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; before HE WILL COME TO THE AGE OF
[2:36:44] UNDERSTANDING THINGS.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; His father was kicked out of the temple.
[2:36:49] Praise the Lord.
[2:36:52] HISTORY WILL TELL US THAT JOHN WENT IN
[2:36:55] THE WILDERNESS AT 9 YEARS OLD.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. IF HIS FATHER
[2:37:02] SERVED THE COUNSEL ALL OF HIS YEARS,
[2:37:04] ISN'T THAT THE COUNSEL THAT'S SUPPOSED
[2:37:06] TO TAKE care of this boy?
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; His his mom and dad died
[2:37:11] when he was just a little child.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Most of the time we like to make it
[2:37:19] spiritual.
[2:37:21] The spirit of the Lord led him in the
[2:37:22] wilderness at 9 years old. 9 years old.
[2:37:25] Let my baby 9 years old. I know what 9
[2:37:27] years, which I do. She's almost.
[2:37:31] Praise the Lord.
[2:37:37] Do you see WHY HE CAME OUT OF THE
[2:37:39] WILDERNESS WITH WITH SUCH A LIFE OF
[2:37:42] COMPLEX?
[2:37:45] YOU SEE WHY HE CAME OUT OF THE
[2:37:46] WILDERNESS AND HE WAS SO HARD ON THE
[2:37:48] PEOPLE.
[2:37:51] Praise the Lord.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he could HE COULDN'T
[2:37:54] BELIEVE THAT THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE THAT
[2:37:56] INTREATED HIS FATHER THEY SPOKE BAD
[2:37:59] WORDS ABOUT HIS FATHER
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; ZACHCHARIAH IS DECEIVED HE HAS AN
[2:38:05] ILLUSION HE HAS FOLLOWED OUT THAT LITTLE
[2:38:07] GIRL MARY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ANGELS
[2:38:09] OR ALL OF THOSE THINGS PUT THOSE things
[2:38:11] into perspective people
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; THE VERY PEOPLE THAT REJECTED HIS FATHER
[2:38:21] NEVER GAVE HIM A GOOD RETIREMENT.
[2:38:24] HE DIED WITH A BROKEN HEART because he
[2:38:27] served the people faithfully.
[2:38:30] When the people SUPPOSED TO BE REJOICING
[2:38:32] IN his blessing that he HAD RECEIVED A
[2:38:34] CHILD IN HIS OLD AGE, THEY turned
[2:38:36] against him
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; and they kick him out.
[2:38:43] John as a little child went into the
[2:38:47] wilderness
[2:38:50] went almost like homeless
[2:38:54] almost like homeless
[2:38:56] that's the reason why it took almost 30
[2:38:58] years because God had to get his
[2:39:01] attention little by little before he
[2:39:03] will finally understand that he had a
[2:39:06] ministry.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:10] Sometimes when young people sit in
[2:39:13] church,
[2:39:15] praise the Lord, the least we can do for
[2:39:18] them as others,
[2:39:22] give them kind words.
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; Try to talk to them.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; Because you are shouting amen. Amen.
[2:39:32] Some sometime they don't understand the
[2:39:33] things we preach. It goes over their
[2:39:35] head. But here they sit down here.
[2:39:46] FINALLY, WHEN JOHN WILL SAY, "BEHOLD THE
[2:39:48] LAMB THAT TAKE AWAY THE SIN OF THE
[2:39:50] WORLD."
[2:39:53] For him to see a vision AND SEEING THE
[2:39:55] VISION COMING TO PASS, HE WILL THINK
[2:39:57] THAT HIS LIFE IS HAVING SOME sense of
[2:40:00] meaning.
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; It will not be too long he will be
[2:40:03] sitting in prison.
[2:40:07] Praise the Lord.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; Certainly. PRAISE HIM. ALL OF THOSE
[2:40:13] things that he went through being a
[2:40:16] child started to come back to him.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's that's what
[2:40:25] praising does.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; It makes you to remember.
[2:40:30] You you force yourself to remember.
[2:40:34] Amen. Cuz you don't have no distraction
[2:40:36] there. So you force yourself to
[2:40:38] remember. You will really meditate.
[2:40:47] Praise the Lord.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of those things come back
[2:40:52] to me. Put it in perspective people.
[2:40:56] Put it in perspective.
[2:40:58] You have really not been hurt
[2:41:02] by religion.
[2:41:04] You have not been hurt when people use
[2:41:07] hurtful words
[2:41:09] and not understanding that you are a
[2:41:12] human.
[2:41:14] Not understanding that you have lot
[2:41:18] through your
[2:41:29] That's the reason why this place is not
[2:41:30] a social gathering.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; This is a community
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; where we must come together with common
[2:41:37] values
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; and do what we can do to make it better.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; Don't expect for it to be better.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; I expect for them to do this. I expect
[2:41:49] for them to do this. What are you doing
[2:41:51] about what you expect? Amen.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; Let's make it better.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:42:10] And John will die
[2:42:13] falling right back
[2:42:16] into the depression he dealt with as a
[2:42:18] child
[2:42:20] because now he's SENDING HIS DISCIPLES.
[2:42:22] GO AND FIND OUT. IS HE THE ONE? HE WAS
[2:42:25] THE VERY ONE THAT SAID, "BEHOLD THE LAMB
[2:42:27] OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE
[2:42:29] WORLD."
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; Why will he now say, "Go and find out.
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; Something has happened to him."
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; Something has happened
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; to this man.
[2:42:39] He never had an easy life.
[2:42:44] Yet he will be the man that Jesus would
[2:42:46] say of all men born of women
[2:42:52] of all men born of women. I was
[2:42:55] listening to brother Brand a few days
[2:42:56] ago. He was talking about Raha.
[2:43:01] I don't know. I don't know why why I get
[2:43:03] connected to those things. But it means
[2:43:05] a whole lot to me because because you
[2:43:07] see many times we preach, we read quotes
[2:43:11] and we don't bring things into
[2:43:13] perspective.
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; You know why the Bible says Elijah was a
[2:43:17] man of lack passion.
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; It's so you can be able to bring your
[2:43:21] life
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; into perspective.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; That when you were reading about those
[2:43:26] people, they were not angels.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN YOU PUT THINGS INTO
[2:43:31] PERSPECTIVE,
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; then it hunts you.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said that was not a word
[2:43:40] of life for her. She had a high life.
[2:43:43] Her family could in the fall so they had
[2:43:45] to put her into the street
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; so she can take care of them. But down
[2:43:49] in her heart
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; was a predestinated sight.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:03] Many has has had hard life.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:44:09] Many people have had high life.
[2:44:16] Glory be to God. Amen.
[2:44:20] When people who take the ministry for
[2:44:22] for pleasure in whatever whatever they
[2:44:25] take it for. Praise the Lord. Their
[2:44:28] measure in in in their wealth and in and
[2:44:31] every other thing God say have men on
[2:44:34] the scene. My brother Brandon said they
[2:44:36] don't even have shoes on their feet.
[2:44:39] I don't have shoes on their feet. I was
[2:44:41] just following uh my my friend Ruben
[2:44:43] Daniel, the brother that told you in
[2:44:46] South Africa that had that uh uh cancer
[2:44:49] where it took up part of his stomach and
[2:44:52] uh I I saw him on on YouTube. So I said,
[2:44:54] "Wow, Ruben is preaching." So I went to
[2:44:57] look at there. What happened was that u
[2:44:59] he he went to to dedicate a church
[2:45:03] where a young man in wheelchair
[2:45:12] he's he's you know he can use his feet
[2:45:17] have moved to the outsetting part of of
[2:45:20] the country and an asker there in in
[2:45:23] Johannesburg in his wheelchair
[2:45:26] going from places to places
[2:45:30] witnessing. He started the church there
[2:45:34] and called brother Ruben to dedicate the
[2:45:36] church and and and and pray for the
[2:45:38] first deacons.
[2:45:40] And as he testified,
[2:45:43] he says, "But Ruben and his wife treated
[2:45:46] me like parents.
[2:45:50] Nobody would even allow me in their home
[2:45:53] before allow me on their pit." Ruben saw
[2:45:56] something in me.
[2:45:58] It just it just moved my heart
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; in which here
[2:46:07] &gt;&gt; doing the best that he can do for
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; if you would if you just if you just
[2:46:19] think that God has been so good to you.
[2:46:24] No matter what you are dealing with,
[2:46:26] there are people that are in worse
[2:46:27] condition than you.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; If you take time and pray for those
[2:46:34] people, your situation will get better.
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; Instead of just sitting down and being
[2:46:39] sorrowful for yourself,
[2:46:41] think about people that don't have the
[2:46:43] the common privilege that you have
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; and pray for them.
[2:46:54] Praise the Lord.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; Let's put Christ back in Christmas.
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; Let's put him back in our homes and back
[2:47:08] in our heart.
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz the manure he's born in is in our
[2:47:12] heart.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:19] And I think about that all the time. I
[2:47:22] think about that all the time. Sometimes
[2:47:24] we get to the place and and and one of
[2:47:27] the the common question that is always
[2:47:29] asked, you know, why why are pastor
[2:47:31] children, you know, uh sometimes the way
[2:47:33] they are?
[2:47:35] Because sometimes uh you know, it's very
[2:47:36] it's very easy to look at it like, oh
[2:47:38] yeah, you know, the devil is attacking
[2:47:40] them to destroy their their uh their
[2:47:42] father ministry. Yeah, you you are
[2:47:45] partly right. Just partly
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; right. You are just part
[2:47:51] some of the things there is that they
[2:47:52] are children.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; And some of the true factor there is
[2:47:59] that sometimes we get so consumed
[2:48:02] worrying about people issues and we
[2:48:04] don't even think about our own children.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:48:11] we get so wrapped up in that
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; you know but uh you know uh I'm just
[2:48:19] trying to bring certain things to you so
[2:48:21] so you can be able to to be able to see
[2:48:23] and and understand when people are going
[2:48:26] through things don't be so quick to
[2:48:28] speak out
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; don't be so quick to criticize
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; our expression will be oh God, what went
[2:48:42] wrong?
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:48:45] &gt;&gt; What went wrong?
[2:48:47] How?
[2:48:52] Because when you create that question in
[2:48:54] your mind, that question will give you a
[2:48:57] constant desire to be seeking in prayer.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, I wonder what is HE DEALING WITH?
[2:49:05] WHAT IS she dealing with?
[2:49:07] It will give you a constant desire. But
[2:49:10] if you if you just call it they
[2:49:12] backslided, they were not believers.
[2:49:14] They don't have the Holy Ghost. You gave
[2:49:16] yourself a definite reason that you
[2:49:18] cannot cross.
[2:49:25] You gave yourself a definite reason that
[2:49:27] you cannot cross because you to you they
[2:49:30] don't have the Holy Ghost. So they I
[2:49:31] mean they are not elect. They are
[2:49:32] serpency.
[2:49:36] So you can never go beyond that.
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; So there will not be a desire in you to
[2:49:42] pray.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; How many times we ever think about
[2:49:48] somebody that you knew that was serving
[2:49:50] the Lord that is not serving the Lord
[2:49:52] anymore? How many times you ever thought
[2:49:54] about them to share the word of prayer?
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; We don't do it.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:50:04] We become so judgmental in our minds.
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; It looks like I become an evangelist
[2:50:13] this morning.
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; Am I Am I yelling at you?
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:50:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:50:25] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to make your Christmas
[2:50:26] merry.
[2:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Merry Christmas.
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; Merry Christmas. I'm trying to make your
[2:50:32] Christmas merry, but I mean church, we
[2:50:35] don't know how long
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; we're going to be here.
[2:50:39] &gt;&gt; We don't know how long we going to be
[2:50:41] here.
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; We are facing another year. We don't
[2:50:44] know what that year brings.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; We don't know what that year is
[2:50:49] bringing.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:50:56] This afternoon, let's go to the manger.
[2:51:00] Let's go and look for Christ to the
[2:51:02] manger.
[2:51:04] Let's go to our hearts and look for
[2:51:08] Christ.
[2:51:10] Let's go there to the manger
[2:51:16] and sing, "Oh, how I love Jesus
[2:51:23] because he first."
[2:51:28] Let's go to the manger and think that
[2:51:32] God should love a sinner such as
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; that's what I want us to do.
[2:51:44] Let's go to the manger.
[2:51:59] That will help us to put Christ back
[2:52:03] in Christmas.
[2:52:05] Musicians, you can come up.
[2:52:08] We'll preach to you another day.
[2:52:13] Let's go back to the manger of our
[2:52:15] heart.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:52:26] Let your word be born
[2:52:30] in the manger of my heart.
[2:52:34] Let it live in me. Let it dry.
[2:52:43] take and find out their course for us.
[2:52:47] Let your word
[2:52:51] be born
[2:52:54] in the manger of my heart.
[2:52:59] Let it live in me.
[2:53:03] Let it star
[2:53:10] live inside this house of clay.
[2:53:15] Long morning every day.
[2:53:21] Let your word be born
[2:53:26] in the manger
[2:53:29] of my heart.
[2:53:35] Oh Lord, let let your word be born
[2:53:42] in the manger of my heart.
[2:53:48] Let it live.
[2:53:52] Let it
[2:53:57] live inside this house of clay.
[2:54:03] Mold me every day.
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; Let your word be bought
[2:54:13] in the manger
[2:54:16] of
[2:54:18] my house.
[2:54:23] Let your word be born
[2:54:28] in the me of my heart.
[2:54:34] Let it live in me.
[2:54:38] Let it start
[2:54:44] live inside his house of clay.
[2:54:49] Move me every day.
[2:54:54] Let your word be born
[2:54:59] in the manger.
[2:55:02] Oh my. Oh, let's just sing it together
[2:55:06] now.
[2:55:08] Oh, let let your word be born
[2:55:14] in the manger of my heart.
[2:55:20] Many living things.
[2:55:23] Let it die.
[2:55:26] I
[2:55:29] live inside this house of clay.
[2:55:34] Be more in every day.
[2:55:40] Let your word be born
[2:55:44] in the vure
[2:55:48] of God.
[2:55:54] Be it onto me. Be it unto me.
[2:56:06] I call it to your word.
[2:56:10] I calling to your proes.
[2:56:16] I can stand secure.
[2:56:20] Oh gather up all my heart
[2:56:27] set me free.
[2:56:39] Yes. All
[2:56:43] to me.
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; I call
[2:56:48] your word.
[2:56:51] &gt;&gt; I call it
[2:56:54] your promises.
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; I can stand

[2:57:42] my heart
[2:57:45] the truth
[2:57:52] to the world
[2:57:58] to me.
[2:58:00] While the music play softly, let's just
[2:58:02] bow our hands together.
[2:58:09] Oh God.
[2:58:17] Lord, you know how many times, Lord, I I
[2:58:20] played that little story yesterday.
[2:58:26] just say in my heart Lord give me
[2:58:28] courage Lord to do the best that I can
[2:58:31] oh God father
[2:58:35] there's a lot of things Lord that
[2:58:37] discourages
[2:58:43] but I promise Lord that I will bring a
[2:58:45] gift Lord I will get out of the way
[2:58:50] I will get out of the way Father and I
[2:58:52] want to get out of the way every moment
[2:58:54] Lord Father
[2:59:01] Lord, we want to go to the manger of our
[2:59:03] hearts
[2:59:05] this afternoon. Father,
[2:59:10] we want to look at that Christ that is
[2:59:13] in our heart.
[2:59:15] Whatever portion of revelation we have,
[2:59:18] Lord,
[2:59:19] whatever is our revelation, whatever,
[2:59:22] Father, we believe of you that we have
[2:59:25] in our hearts this afternoon, we want to
[2:59:28] go back to that place, Lord.
[2:59:32] We want to go back to that place, oh
[2:59:34] God.
[2:59:37] Oh Jesus,
[2:59:39] this is all about you, Father.
[2:59:56] And when we look on God in our heart,
[2:59:58] what do we think about the Christ? What
[3:00:01] do we think about what God is doing in
[3:00:04] our life? What do we think about it?
[3:00:21] We might have uh broken lives and comes
[3:00:25] from broken homes. And there are a lot
[3:00:28] of things of our past of our upbringing
[3:00:32] that haunt us and and a lot of things
[3:00:34] that we have experienced in this life.
[3:00:36] The disappointment, the hurt and all of
[3:00:38] that. But yet God choose to bring his
[3:00:42] word.
[3:00:44] &gt;&gt; To my heart and he choose to bring his
[3:00:46] word to your heart.
[3:00:51] &gt;&gt; He chose for Christ the revelation of
[3:00:54] Jesus Christ to be born in you. Not just
[3:00:57] a head knowledge,
[3:01:00] he can touch your heart.
[3:01:10] What do you think this afternoon of what
[3:01:12] God is doing in your life?
