preachers in the pull pit ought to have pen coats instead of the clergy coat standing out there and will permit it and ashamed to speak against it because their denomination put them out you crucify

and then singing a choir because he got a voice you poor interal spiritual deprived rejected upon your own ground you read the same Bible any other man can read but you've turned down the spirit of God to the Bible said you be given over to a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by it you actually believe that you're right and the Bible says that you'd believe it and be damned by the same lie that you believe to be the truth therefore I you by the word of God you're teaching a people a eror and crucifying the principles of Christ Holiness and life above the poor person might walk out on the street and be a different person yes preacher standing on Ball Ground smoking cigarettes Lord stumbling blocks amen all the other Tommy rot that they put up with women in their choir wearing shorts bobbed hair and carrying on like that painted faces and then call it sister this and that and the Bible condemns that stuff that's right go to parties and carry on still a member of the church maintain your testimony and live any way you want to don't think I'm talking all together about Presbyterians I'm talking about you Pentecostals right you once knew the truth but you thought you couldn't take it you couldn't support your pastor you your pastor couldn't have that big job with so many hundred a week in a big fine Church to preach in and ride and carry on the way they do if he condemned that the organization would throw him out so he has to keep it yeah he has to say it therefore he sold his birth rights for a mess ofage of the world of Esau's SLO and once he go to get fart both fall into the ditch of condemnation and be them as prostitutes of the [Applause] Gospel I that a chir one of the famous big places not long ago one of the highest ranks of Pentecost that there is I have be sit in this brother's study one of four five choirs got together and one of the some of the finest organizations of the Pentecostals and they didn't know I was in this Minister study at Oklahoma I sitting down there below where this Minister studies before he comes to his platform and what he did there was them little Ricky out there and Rickett is paint not a one of them had long hair every one of them with bobbed hair every one of them with makeup on every one of them with robes on and little Ricky standing around there going along like that and another man was taking up a missionary offering he act like he was a blind man with a cup and going around saying all kind of blasphemy things about taking up the offering and things like that but got out there and tried to sing the um the Messiah oh man it could do a pretty good job at it but it didn't have the ring no it was dead see oh my there you are that's his new gol gotha why do you think it's some little girl or some little woman in there well if she had come in there dressed like she should have been with long hair and paint on off and things like that they'd have made fun of her if she have stood up and when he making that D do there that bunch of young people about 30 or 40 of them the selected part of Pentecost and doing things like that if that little lady would have said something about there put her out of the choir let the gospel preacher stand in the pull pit and say something about they put him out of the organization you crucify the Son of God aresh and put him to an open Shain his gospel that you claim to preach you crucifying I indite this Christ rejected Generation by the word of God Hallelujah and by its power of this last days of indication that he is still alive yes they are against the Clean Cut Vindicated word of God there are organizations can't stand up to it big churches and denominations this is New Calvary I say it again this their modern strip teases are their choirs the high priest of each denomination cries out like the high priest of that day now come to and show us a [Music] miracle that was the first crucifixion it's the same today I've had him say Well now you rais the dead do you why don't you go up there you got a wife in the graveyard got a baby up there they said to him we heard you raise the dead we got a graveyard full of them up here come raise it oh ignorance will breed ignorance big churches big choirs high priest to this day come down show us a miracle our denomination can't do I had a man not long ago made a remark on a after a little broadcast I had in Jonesboro Arkansas telling about some woman being healed this a fell belonged to a certain denomination of church and he got up behind there and said I challenge any man to bring me and show me a miracle I went and got a doctor a man have been cured with cancer went and got a woman been in the wheelchair for about 20 years she was healed of arthritis been in the wheelchair I Tu it over and said said now I want the money $1,000 he said well uh uh it isn't here it's over in Waco Texas where our headquarters is I said all right we'll just go over there and get it said I said you make arrangements and we'll go tomorrow I see I said we'll make I said here's the doctor to say that these people absolutely had cancer here on the list x-ray here's this woman in the whole neighborhood knows she's sat in that wheelchair for 20 years and she's walking right now and the doctors's been doctor after doctor after doctor after doctor and everything and here she is alive today Hallelujah now you said you give $1,000 I want to put it in the missionary fund I [Applause] wanted he said what's over at Waco Texas I said we'll go tomorrow he said wait a minute let me tell you something I'll take a little girl with me and let me take a razor and cut her arm and then you heal it before our Brethren and they'll give you the money I said you devil if thou be the Son of God come off of this cross tell us who hits you with a rag around his head hit him on and said now if you're Prophet tell us who if thou be the Son of God come down off the cross Lord blind leaders of the blind they need mental healing a man to do a thing like that or make a remark like that certainly a familiar old cry oh let us see you do a miracle Master we would desire a miracle from you whenever day every hour was happening right along just as God would lead it to be done but they wasn't present if they was they called it the El above the devil Yes master we desire if you do it the way we want you to do it that's it go where we want you to go do what we we oh yes they had no strings on him no sir that's the reason why had to get him out of their midst yes sir they're trying to do the same thing today and through the Federation of churches they'll finally accomplish to do it all of them going The Familiar old crime here we see again the most religious place the best polished theologians calling out again and against him calling out the very best theologians which ought to know different the very highest churches and best trained theologians cast him out of their midst they don't want it you say that's wrong brother bandam then you wasn't here to see the church ages you heard it preached you wasn't here when this lady of see in church age was the only one that they cast him out of the church and he's out the outside knocking trying to get back in they cast him out because they haven't got no use for him they crucify him aresh amen how long could we go remember the prophet of God's word foret told us in second Timothy 3 if you're writing it down we haven't got time to read it but said that in the last days scoffers would come they'd be heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God false accusers incontinent Fierce and despisers of those that are good tray headyy highminded scholarly having a farm of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this is a sort that takes s bobbed haired women short wearing painted faces from place to place lead them captive exactly he said turn away from it in the last days let's obey the prophet turn away from those things in the last days they here I'm calling to the church now yes sir get away from it they have they the the Ministers of this day should know these things they should have know Jesus in his days they should have know it now they should know it but they don't know it just as the Jewish teachers of his days should have known him by his day so is it today of God's clearly Vindicated word Dan he was the word and he proved he was the word he proved he was the word for that day and God is proven today that he's the word of this day the light of the hour and they should have known it then and they should know it Now They Crucified him then and they crucify him now I and D him of it right just keeps flashing through me and D him cuz God's going to make them pay for it the Jews of their days God again in the days on Earth Jesus said Jerusalem Jerusalem how off would I have gathered you in one great big group but you would not how God has tried in his last days and unite his people together you would not you've desired your Creed so now you're given over to destruction that's what Jerusalem received she is tore down burned down she's no more and that's exactly what will be some of these days to all these big things your your big Creeds and denominations will die and perish but the word of God will be Eternal and live forever amen his deepest wounds come from the house of so-called friends think think of it think of it stop I'm waiting a minute ministers think of it where did his wounds come from the house of his so-call friends as it was so is it think of it at Calvary he wasn't surrounded by by Savages barbarians but of ministers who claim to love him and today when the gospel is Thoroughly identified when the Great Signs of his resurrection is proven Among Us it isn't the street out there that jumps on you it's the so-called ministers them exposed to love him is what he's surrounded by today we will not have that thing among us we'll not have this man rule over us we'll not support we'll have no cooperation about that in this C if that thing comes this way it's nothing but spiritualism it's the devil not knowing the word of God the blind leading the blind as it was then think so is it now just as it was then so is it now think his power to heal and to set man and woman free from the love of this present World from the bobbed haired painted Facey Jezebels that calls themselves Christians and producing such a life as that cigarettes smoking dirty joke telling sit down and have a missionary society and Stitch and sew and talk and Scandal and and get out on the street and wear shorts and everything like that and then call themselves Christians before other women that's right you remember my story about the slave knowing he was a son of a king his character what art we to be man and women and deny these clergymen these pull pits where he gets his Pierces they put up and endorse that kind of living amongst the people where they piercing they deny the power to to set them free from it and they endorse it to be so when it's a contrary to the word of God for a woman to Bob her hair or to paint her face or to wear shorts It's contrary to the word of God but they endorse it making another Calvary from where from the street from the barroom from the pulpit amen pulpit and again what was the cry He makes himself God they denies his deity they try to split him up make three or four Gods out of him when he is God he was God he'll always be God the same yesterday today and forever when you talk about one God to them they laugh at you we believe in a Holy Trinity I believe in one holy God hallelujah his power to heal to set free and take these people out of the love of the world to free them like it did Mary magdalina remember she was a little painted up Jezebel too she had Seven Devils in her she's a strip teas just like the modern woman on the street today go anywhere you want to look if you won believe people bows it's a shrine of naked women look out on the street today as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be look out if you don't believe it just anywhere open up a paper open up a magazine look at a billboard why are you find amen remember what it said when the sons of God saw the daughters of man was faroh they taken un them women look at the scandal in England look at the Scandal here look at the whole Things become a house of prostitution yes why is it why did Russia become communism because of vulgar and dirtiness and the non-power of the Catholic church that's exactly why this nation is taking over communism and the Federation of churches and Jing itself up with the Catholic Church which Communism and Catholicism will unite together you know and here they are doing it why because they have rejected the gospel and separates them and makes them a different people and exactly the reason and ministers in the P pits putting up with it [Music]
