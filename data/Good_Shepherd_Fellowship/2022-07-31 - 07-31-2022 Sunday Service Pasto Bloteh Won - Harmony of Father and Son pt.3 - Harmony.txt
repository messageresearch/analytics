control father come lord we love you we appreciate your father in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you and uh hallelujah praise the lord amen we thank the lawful uh this privilege that we have and let's just go right into the word and i'm i'm a little bit nervous this morning because i don't have all my stuff together so uh i will depend on you to do the preaching amen i'm just going to stand on stand here then and uh depend on you for you to do the preaching do the pulling do do everything and uh if the service turned out well let's give praise to the lord and realize that you did the work amen praise the lord amen and as we said that this uh uh evening we want to come back for the little prayer meeting and the communion service uh uh realizing that a lot of our uh first weekend in the month uh being taken by one thing or another the young people will be gone this first weekend for the youth uh banquet i also have some taxing services coming up this uh weekend in harare i should be having about six meetings and i really really need the grace of god because i don't have the human strength for some reason i'm just becoming very very tired i think it's a lot of things on my mind but i pray that the law will will just give strength and uh and then uh september there's this wedding brother robert wilson in chicago asked me to help them uh there to know the family there that uh the sister i think they drove down your one time for service sister rose and her daughter be getting married so uh uh we will be helping them with the services there so i just thought okay it would be good for us to just come together this evening and have a little prayer meeting and remember the lord in the word of communion tonight praise the lord and another reason did is that uh while i was going away that was i was preaching somewhere and that evening i was actually going to speak on the on the on the message the sunday morning i preach for brother elijah you know he's uh familiar to many of us here and then the evening i was going to go to one of the next uh province as we will call it that way and pray for brother moses there but in the morning there was [Music] a relative to my senior brother that passed that morning so they were going to go there and and they didn't wanted to uh to be away so we cancelled the service and and the brother had to change his uh weekly service to accommodate me i think on tuesday uh since i was i was going to be living out there soon so uh but then while i was growing that i had this thought on my mind to talk i was going to actually speak on the the the importance of the three ordinances that jesus left with the new testament church the importance of the three ordinances which is water baptizing communion and fault washing and [Music] one reason was to encourage those group of believers and and also uh bring some structural approach to that subject because like brother branham said key in the door that's that those are some of the things that uh i didn't put together this morning it will all going to be part of my introduction before i get into the message i want to preach but he said you know the subject of communion became a big subject in the early church it was not as as big as when after catholicism took over because we realized that it was something that was very common in the book of acts with the early believers because the bible says they went from house to house breaking bread and uh in a way that we understand the history of the early church every time they gather they use that to commune with the lord sit up a little bit better than that michael and they use that to to commune you know to remember the lord every time they gather they'll have a service you know at the end of the evening they will they will remember the law that way and then uh as as time went on uh the church adopted uh having communion on the first the first sunday in honor of the resurrection you know and a lot of you but then when catholicism took over uh uh there were a lot of things that were introduced into the church and uh and that's when uh it started to become a communion actually for for the new testament church started to take another shape it tells us to take another form why because catholicism introduced uh the teaching of communion as partaking of the literal body of jesus christ and as common as that may sound to you it is it is very very important very very uh it has a whole weight because uh uh catholic catalysing does dostnet it does not take that lightly they don't take it for granted to them is very is very serious and the dogma that is behind there that is dangerous is that with jesus word except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you the catholic church adopted the teaching that by the instruction of the pope the catholic priest has the power to be able to take that little wiffle that is in his hands and wave some enchantment and and prayer to change there to the literal body of jesus christ praise the lord and and the the church has been so brainwashed it has been so brainwashed this whole subject i've read about it you know i'll read a few quotes from brother branham and read a little bit on church history but it really did not hit me until late late i i went through a book 50 year in the church of rome when i got when i went through that book because the altar of the book actually was a catholic priest just like luther was a priest and and all of these different men that god used through through the church ages but you will realize that because god has a specific work for every one of us there's a unique work and it's it's more like like uh charles chinoque was was raised up and placed in the the catholic system just to be able to bring us some some uh some information behind the dark curtains that you and myself who have never known about now brother brennan referenced charles chinook in a message paul the prisoner uh if you want to go instead and find it you will find it there and uh and it's it's it just it opened my mind to areas where you were just overlooked and and and and that alone took me back to started going again and studying on the subject of communion and because just like how the the catholic has that dogma to believe that and it's very strongly belief it's a very strong dogma that affect the people so much and i mean because of time there are things i would not want to go into uh but then brother branham in the message key to the doll he says you know the catholic believe that the the communion is uh is partaking of the literal body of jesus christ and he says that's what uh uh separate the catholic from the protesting because the protestants do believe that the communion is just a symbol praise the lord amen and then and then brother branham also went on talking about uh also there's there's a group of people that also believe that [Music] we do take spiritual communion every time we come to church praise the lord we do take spiritual communion because the communion represents the body of the lord which which of course is the word amen so every time we come to fellowship every time we come to service we are actually having a communion service we are communing with the lord do you believe that praise the lord we we are communion with the lord every time we come to service now so you you have all of those things and there's a group of people that are so comfortable with their spiritual communion that uh that the the literal ordinance of communion is gradually growing away from the church even in message churches because of the fact that we we have the word we have the open book we have the reveal word and every time we are feeding on the word we are not feeding on dogma we are feeding on the body word of the son of man and we can we can put all of those quotes together so that that literal audience is is beginning to fade away and i will talk a little bit on that to this evening and what i will read some quotes and then you have this other group of people that have a bit of a catholic mind that looks at the the you know the the the communion the you know the communion bread you know that is is is a it's a sacred thing and uh and and that's the body of the lord you know uh uh so when it comes to uh fulfilling the literal ordinance they are afraid of it they don't want to touch it they don't want to come close to it praise the lord amen and and even when it come close to to taking uh a communion they come with uh you know uh uh you know uh you know reverence and you know when and stay there and you know say their prayers and and you know uh uh lord i'm taking your body in you know your your body into my your blood and body into my body lord you know and just that mind but i believe that it's a carryover from capitalism i believe there is a balance i believe there is a place that we have to come to that's right it's true that paul warn us that uh we must examine ourselves by the word we must look at our our sacrifice amen as we examine ourselves he says for this cause some are sick you know uh some are dead and you know different things happen you know if we if we take the communion on walter lee we must never take it for granted praise the lord amen because it has its place in the local church but we we must also never take the communion over the world praise the lord amen what do i say there is the other if we will get to the place where we have so much reference for their physical ordinance and we can come to church sit in service fee comfortable with our indifferences sit on of the preaching of the word and don't hear it but then when it comes to communion service then we escape it's an idol it's idolatry because you are taking that literal ordinance above the word and there is no ordinance that is above the word of god you see what i'm going with this praise the lord it's almost like a person that will that will that will uh want a water bath tasting and uh and then we be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ which is uh uh uh that represent the death burial and uh resurrection of jesus christ lord and then after being identified with that symbol they will not want to take the correction from god's word because we are watched by the watching of the word praise the lord so you see those ordinances are placed in the church they have their place in their church they must they must never be overlooked praise the lord they must never be overlooked in in no way we must not we must not neglect them and also we must not uh uh you know we must not we must not be careless as we approached him because we to all the ordinance of god there is blessing and cursing that is attached to it praise the lord there is blessing and curses that i attached to it and uh those are some of the things that uh i was thinking about and i thought that i will actually wanted to take a service and speak on there but i i also had this scripture on my mind praise the lord deuteronomy chapter 7. uh god bless you brother johnny and let's uh i realized that we have not read the scripture yet and i've and i'm going like this praise the lord so for scripture reading let's get into our faith it's in john chapter five we'll come back again to the book of deuteronomy it's in john chapter five it's in john chapter 5 we stay lingering around the harmony of the father and the son this this uh this place we want to go this morning let's read from verse 19. on wednesday night we read from verse one and [Music] we spoke a little bit of how the atonement has been idolized during the ages verse 19 then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do what the father revealed to him see the father do for what things so ever he does this also do with the son likewise for the father loved the son and show it himself and show and show us him all things that himself does and he will show him greater work than this that ye my mother for as the father rises of the dead and quicken and quickeneth them even so the son quaking at home he will praise the lord for the father joshua no man but have committed all judgment unto the son let us pray father we want to thank you for the portion of your word that we have read and we we are fully fully trusting on you lord this morning that you will just come and take your word now father and and bless us in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed we'll come back just in john chapter five that's what that was where our subject is from let's go back to the book of deuteronomy there was something there that caught my mind oh praise the lord amen moses year speak to the children of israel when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whether thy god will possess it and have cast out many nations before thee then he names the seven nations now the seven nations in in in the form of a type we can take there as the seven church agents praise the lord because uh god bringing out his bride from each of these church ages praise the lord and and these are the the nations uh whom uh uh israel was giving inheritance in the elaine praise the lord verse 2 and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them none show mercy unto them neither shall thou make marriages with them that daughter shall not go unto his sons and his daughters shall not take their sons for their will turn away their sons from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be countered against you and destroy the southern land praise the lord but they are but thus shall thou deed with them it shall destroy their altars and break down the images and cut down their gross and burn their gravy images with fire for thou art unholy people unto the lord the law thy god has chosen thee now this is the verse that caught my attention let's let's follow it closely there are holy people unto the lord the law that god has chosen thee to be a special people onto unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth can we say amen the lord did not set his love upon you not choose you because ye were more in number than any people for year where the feareth of all people but because the lord loves you praise the lord i go back again and read verse 6. for thou art unholy people unto the lord thy god now when god when moses was saying this to the people now you have to remember that this is uh the book of deuteronomy and is is is these are some of moses final words praise the lord these are some of his final words that he would say to the people knowing that uh uh for these very same people one time god wanted to destroy them and moses put himself in a gap and said lord you have to take me if you ever touch these people and then at another time moses got angry with the people and for these very same people god told him you're not going to see the land [Music] now he's speaking to these people that have gave him trouble all through the wilderness these people that were murmuring these people they have all of the problems that make this man will not go into the promised land yeah he's speaking some of his last words to them and he's telling them for thou are unholy people unto the lord not a holiness that they have achieved but a holiness that was bestowed on them not a holiness because they did not have temper now the holiness because they were they have overcome lust not a holiness because they have they are they were now experiencing total deliverance and they had the baptism of the holy ghost with fire not because of that but now the prophet moses was now looking through the art of god and now he's now looking at god's people the way that god looked at his people praise the lord amen oh may i find the out of god this morning to be able to look at you the way almighty god is looking at you praise the lord amen i need a kind of water to wash my face amen i hope there was amazing yeah i could wash my face and see if i would be able to look at you the way almighty god is looking at you for there are unholy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god have chosen them to be a special people unto him brother branham in the message one in a million he says just like in the natural life there were many cells from our father that were also good to live since there were millions of cells from our father millions of eggs from our mother they were all so good to live they had the same they had every potential that our cell had but for it to be us that would come alive and the rest of those cells would they would die it took almighty god to choose from the millions of cells that came from our father and the millions of exhales from our mother it took almighty god to choose which of those air cells will meet the blood cells to form you and in his choosing he will allow the rest of the million cells to die just because he did not want my mama to have millions of babies at once he only wanted me praise the lord and brother brahm said in in that choosing whether it was going to be a girl or a boy almighty god had to decide what is going to be the completion of the child almighty god has to do the choosing how many hair strain will come on the baby almighty god has to do the choosing he did all of those choosing for our natural ethnic life with his infinite wisdom praise the lord the prophet of god was saying that if god if god they they are choosing and we can stand today and say sir you know i am fearfully and wonderfully made praise the lord if you can look at yourself in the mirror and appreciate yourself and thank god that you are alive and love yourself and that was all god's choosing for your effort life everybody how much more for your spiritual body how much more concerning those things that we need from earth to glory how much more let's read our scripture again the lord for there are and holy people unto the lord the law that god has choosing thee to be a special people don't think about israel this morning think about yourself praise the lord just like i said uh moses using the art of god to to look at god's people that have created all the problems for him and [Music] those people hearing moses saying this to them after moses will come back to tell them the lord our god will not allow me to go in the promised land but i'm telling you the lane is real amen now you think about it now after the people will now realize that they have they have caused this man some headache they ridiculed his wife they doubted him when he came the income against him and then uh cora and denton and all of that and to realize that they are sitting down and and and he's telling them the lord thy god you are a holy people the lord that god has choosing me for a special people praise the lord now this is the man that that you know that uh smack the rock and call the people rebel now he's he's he's he's calling the people and holy people a special people now just as he's using the art of god to be able to look upon the people and speak to the people now the people need the heart of god to be able to receive what is spoken to them praise the lord because there's a spiritual war that is going there amen moses by the grace of god a prophet of god has been lifted up in the spirit you know and now he can no longer see the people that's rebel and he's saying you are a holy people praise the lord and these people that he's calling holy people have just coming from fussing and fusing before they came to the service they are sitting honor the prophet now he's saying you are a holy people you are a chosen people you what is going through their minds what is going through their minds praise the lord now moses is speaking to them this way and in all that this brother and myself we just we we had it this morning if you if you moses if you knew what happened this guy myself we had it i gave him the peace of my mind praise the lord and you see the prophet could say all of this on the people and yet the people could come from that service feeling so defeated because they are they are they they are so battle in their mind that everything that moses is saying god has chosen you god has called you a holy people they have not been able to accept it there is nothing in them to be able to embrace that they are so identified with their failure their negative thinking that's right there is nothing in them to say amen moses praise the lord amen amen for thou our unholy people unto the lord of people the law that god has choosing thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth praise the lord oh how we could take that and call ourselves the super race praise the lord and we can call ourselves god's ego in every and every other denomination of verses of the devil and and and pride can get stuck under our wings that is a wings that can only flop and can never come down when pride gets stuck on it it just it just stay up like this now realizing that almighty god will look upon us like this how humble we should be praise the lord how humble we should be to say lord be it unto me i call him to your word a special people unto himself above all the people upon the face of the earth the law that now set his love upon you oh that was that was that was what i was actually studying something drew me to that when god set his love upon the man yes when god set his love upon a martyr praise the lord amen amen for god so loved the word he loved the word because he made the word but yet in the word that he has made he has set his love upon a man upon a people the lord did not set his love upon you no choose you because you were more in numbers than any people for you were feared of all people but because the lord loves you and because he will keep the art which he have sown unto your father praise the lord if god says he will get himself a bride he's going to keep that heart praise the lord amen he's going to keep that heart no matter what the message people want to turn themselves into god is going to keep his heart praise the lord amen amen the lord loves you and because he will keep the art which he has sown unto your fathers have the lord brought you out of the mighty hands and redeem you out of the house of banish from the hands of pharaoh and the king no therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keep it coveted and mercy with them that love him and keep his to a thousand generation can we say praise the lord amen praise the lord the lord is going to keep his coveting you know as i was thinking about base i was just i was just different things were going through my mind and i was thinking uh about you know how it's so easy like brother branham would say we can use our canary brain you know to think that we we know everything and we know everything that is happening and we so and with that canary brain we quick to come to conclusions by the mind of god is very great the mind of god is very great praise the lord and i just feel in my heart this morning even though they will not stop me from preaching why it's on my heart to preach but i feel on my heart this morning that i believe that's the way the lord god looks upon us he's the one that have caught us he's the one that have chosen us we have not chosen ourselves neither have we chosen him he have chosen us and everything that he have determined concerning our life there is no devil in hell the lord amen there is no attribute in our jain or in our blood that can stop that seed praise the lord amen that can stop that seed of god for coming to life i want to tell you this morning god eyes is upon you amen thank you praise the lord amen and like an old preacher said he says uh he loved you so much that he will not keep his eyes off he will keep his eyes off praise the lord amen he knows our struggle he knows exactly where you are this morning he knows what's what is your most need beyond what you determine is your need almighty god knows the most thing that you are in need of this morning he knows the one thing that can change your life and you can never be the same praise the lord that's the god that we have to deal with amen that's the god that we had to deal with and all if it was a day where he would he would just speak audibly to us you know whether the preacher would just sit down and the voice of god would just speak praise the lord amen but god in his uh his peculiar ways and i was i was i was looking at uh unveiling of god brother brahms make this statement he says he said [Music] he said saying something and not saying it he said all of this year i've been trying to say something and not saying it and i i said to myself i said how is that all through the scripture praise the lord amen the pharisees came to join the baptist and says tell us are you elias are you one of the prophets he said i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness saying something and not trying to say it praise the lord they asking the question he answered the question and it's all through the scripture but i believe that is a design that that that is a design of almighty god he designed it that way because there is a there there is an ability in every son and daughter of god like jesus said my sheep year in my voice amen there is that ability to be able to pick up the deep thoughts of god to be able to pick up those things that he's speaking to us directly yeah even if i try to say it clearly i will never be able to say like the way the spirit will reveal it to you praise the lord so we uh we just want to appreciate the lord for that we want to thank him for what his grace is doing in our lives amen he has brought us from the mighty long way and we believe the one that has brought us this far is able to take us in and i can tell you since we are more closer than the miles that we have come there's no need of turning back amen there's no need of throwing in a tower praise the lord we as we are close amen the next step could be on heaven's show your next step to be behind the curtain of time it could be right in the presence of god praise the lord o may he give us grace may he give us grace praise the praise the lord may he give us grace this morning hallelujah amen amen so we will we would like to get into our subject this morning thinking about uh uh uh uh john veda you know we we uh spoke on there before the what matter of love that the father have been stored upon us we can be called sons and daughters of god and uh and john said all of those things you know like brother brahma says after he came you know out of the island of patmos after after he have experienced you know uh what what we are experiencing now you know he was he was he was shown things by the angel you know the deep things of god he was shown things concerning the ages and all of that and and then he came out of that and he make this statement and he says he that have the sin of the seed of god do not commit sin it's a kind of a strong statement that our our human mind struggle with amen and uh i said as i think on that trying to read a little bit on on uh that's uh first john chapter three first run chapter 3. president chapter 3 verse 7 little children let no man deceive you he that does righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god is manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil praise the lord whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed god's seed remedies in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god praise the lord now if you look at this again our mind can go into all of our wrongs but we we have there with this with this before we just drop right in here to be able to realize the other uh [Music] okay let's let's go up a little bit let's let's just go off a little bit i just want to bring this in so so we can we can uh verse five and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin the lord so when john these year with the subject of saints and sin we know that every time he talks about sin without the s he goes back to the beginning which is unbelief praise the lord so he that is born of god will not disbelieve god's word amen even if he's not living up to it he will say amen to the world praise the lord are we together so we will we just trust a lot we stay in there and just keep going and keep going but let's come back to our subject the gamers church age brother branham says now notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the father first john 5 19 that was what we read this harmony is known to exist between the groom and the brine he shows her his word of life she receive it praise the lord amen she receive it and then they produce itself she never does it therefore nothing can harm her not even death praise the lord why because she received the word of promise praise the lord now we read there over in uh uh uh saint john chapter 5 jesus making this very same statement and then he goes on and he made a statement here that the the father george had no man but has committed all judgment on to the son why because it's the harmony that is between the father and the son the father has a work he did a portion of work and the son also go back to genesis god said let there be he created separated the water from the land and he was able to have a son in his image praise the lord and now that son was the one man that named the animals name the plants so you see the harmony of the father and the son has been right from the beginning are we together first king chapter two um praise the lord sometimes we get a so in the place where the you know we we expect every service to be fire and brimstones amen praise the lord and people that comes out of fire and brainstorms if it is not fired and brainstormed the service was not great praise the lord every saturday we got to break the building down and then we rebuilt it for the next service the greatness of god is not seen in destruction amen it's not it's not only seen in destruction praise the lord hallelujah so if you if you came with your hammer to break down this morning praise the lord amen now first king chapter 2 now the days of david drew 9 that he should die and he tries solomon his son saying i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and show that self a man and and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his stature and his combining and his judgment his testimony as it is written in the lord of moses that thou may have prospered in all that the others and whatever so ever thou turned ourself that the lord may continue his word which he speaks concerning means saying if that children take heed to their ways to walk before men in truth with all their heart and with all the assault there shall not fail thee say he a man on the throne of israel but you will you will realize that this was broken if you study the kings because there was a seed of david that the lord told they would destroy him in all his sons praise the lord do you believe that you want us to do a little bible studies amen you see so yeri said god moses i mean david is re-echoing he's re-echoing the covenant that god gave him to his son harmony between the father and the son amen and and says this is the word of the lord the lord told me if my sons my sons will walk in the statute of the lord keep his commandment they will not fail to be a seed of david on the throne praise the lord amen oh i love this hallelujah i love this because that's those are some of the things that put me in my elements glory be to god but then we realize when you come to to study you will realize the other let me just do a little a little search here i wrote that yet i was making some notes now you see word that's the reason why the promise of the virgin shall conceive praise the lord that was the reason why god gave israel that promise is there anything too high for the lord it says the virgin a virgin shall conceive i will give you a sign why because now it would take a virgin birth to be able to fulfill the promise that god gave to david because a seed of david disobeyed god and he and all his sons wesley praise the lord he found that in uh in the life of jacob knight he and all his sons were asleep so that that would have ended the natural sea of david on the throne the only way that he or david would come back on the throne it has to be by a birth that is not by man's hands praise the lord amen so you will see that's the reason why over in the in in in the book of luke there is two genealogy between matthew and luke luke brought christ into david lynch true mary why because he was the sea of the woman back to genesis 3 15 are we together now so i've i've i kind of frustrated from there but uh uh uh it just it just kind of hit my mind here and david's speaking to to solomon in this white and the lord may continue his word which he speaks concerning me saying if that children take heed to their ways to walk before meaning truth with all their hearts and with all the assault there shall not fail thee he set a man on on the throne of israel praise the lord moreover than their knoweth also what job the sun now so what is what what we are going into and what is happening here is that david is in his final days these are the last words of david to his son solomon but now david just like jesus said the father judges no man but has committed all judgment on to the son david now is going to rehearse to solomon the man that did him evil praise the lord amen he's going to rehearse to solomon remember job remember this one i spit in my face remember this other one what is happening there the father committing all judgment unto the son praise the lord when that when when when that benji my spirit in david's face one of his men took out a sword you dog spit on my master david said leave him david said leave him jesus said you call the son of man that baseball it will be forgiving you but one word spoken against the holy ghost will not be forgiving you in this word or in the word to come so it put the church in the same harmony between the father and the son so the church is is taking a special place a place of mercy and a place of judgment got one word praise the lord he met paul on the road of damascus and said so so why persecute thou me praise the lord so i never met him in his ethnic ministry never met him in his earthly life but because he was haunting the church of the living gods down praise the lord because he was haunting the church he was persecuting the church he was ridiculing the church and everything that he was saying against the church it was against christ last week we read spoken word is original see life comes through the body amen god church might be a few group of people they might not have the wealth of this world it can be on a a little tent or on a scoffer building but as long as they are named after the name of the lord god is identified with them amen praise the lord if we don't think that's the place we want to be because we want to be in a building like this with air conditioning and you know then find one leave that leave that small rugged group of people whether they're sitting on on the ground praise the lord are they sitting on benches whatever condition they are in understanding the position of the local church the same relationship and harmony that was between the father and the son the prophet said it should exist between the bride and it's existing between christ and his bride praise the lord so you go back you can read the entire scripture then and use your concordance and go back and search and see all of those cases because when david when david mentioned job here there were three things he mentioned joe above he went back to abner abner was the captain of saw army praise the lord amen he was the captain of saul i mean now you would think you would think now let look look at it this way joe up is the man that has stood with david he's he's the captain of the group praise the lord amen and our soul is dead as long as abner and his men he keeps his men together he will always found an attack against uh job or against david so job in his mind thinking that if i can get rid of the captain i can i can dismember the ban amen they don't have a head over them anymore they were either surrounded they would run away or they were surrounded praise the lord in david's mind thou was a seed of israel he was a captain of the army of israel praise the lord amen take another example again because sometimes we it's easy for us to get ourselves to the place and and you know get in our own channel of understanding and then justify everything we are doing take take another example here take this this next man that that david mentioned for which reason he's selling solomon you you you will take care of job i know you will take care of him praise the lord out that and the next man there is there uh and what he did to the two captains of the host of israel now that's that's the underlying phrase that's the underlying phrase no matter what church they were in what camp they were in these were seas of israel praise the lord and the next guide uh uh amasha he's uh he's he was the captain of the army when absalom kicked his father from the throne now so think about it now himalaya why why should why should david grief over there in a human sense you will understand that job was trying to protect him because these were the people that were rebelling but that's what we will realize that some of the things that we we hold to you know that's my standing you will realize that when you get to the river you were not needed to cross you were not needed to cross praise the lord but you would need someone to cross you naturally you would think you go back and read the story this this man i mean i i mean uh uh abner he was was saw they were haunting david down but you see just like the same position that moses talked when he came to the last hours of his days the very same people he rebelled he called rebel now he's telling me you are holy people verb said i've seen many people crossing this life he said i have seen many on their deathbed before the cross and go to the region of the lust and i have also seen many before the cross and go to the region of the blessing praise the lord he says many when they get to that place they can feel the influence of the other word praise the lord and i believe in my heart as moses as david get closer this was his last word and you read down the bible says and he was gathered with his father verse 10 so david slept with his father and was buried in the city after he has said these things so it means that when he when he got to that place in his life he was now on another influence praise the lord where he could see and understand things better sometimes we think we understand it we get it we calculate it and we get everything together and sometimes those calculation and conclusion we come to impressing our spirit that we cannot go any further we cannot make room we cannot make accommodation for nothing else because we have established in ourself that i believe this is the truth praise the lord you even see some people god will dedicate me god only vindicate his word god do not benefit a mortar he vindicate his word praise the lord hallelujah these two captives of israel whom he slayed and and sheared the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon the gather that was about his limbs and and and in his shoes that was on his feet dude therefore a calling to thy wisdom committing judgment do a calling to that wisdom david was not expressing his anger he was committing to the son praise the lord i hate that man he was not expressing his anger he says do according to your wisdom he was committing to the son praise the lord and let none of his hair hair go down to the grave in peace but show kindness to the sons of brazilian the gate line and and let them be of those that eat at that table he's he's running judgment on this side he's also giving mercy on the side the father committing all judgment unto the son praise the lord amen now you see uh uh and as the prophet of god said that's that's uh that's that is the relationship that is existing between christ and his bride amen because he paid the price he came and he gave his life but yet there is a little portion of redemption and redemption work that needs to be done and the bride is here to be able to carry it carry that out but you see she's in power she's not just standing on her own word or on her own merit and trying to do things but no she's in power she has an authority that is backing her up praise the lord the exposition of the seventh church age and there they hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22 17. the spirit and the bride says come the corn of wheat the bright wheat that fell into the ground at nissan council has come back to original word green again praise god forever amen yes listening to the authenticity prophet of god who appear in the last day what he say from god the bride will say the bride the prophet the spirit the bride and the prophet let me say it right the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing amen praise the lord because that is the harmony praise the lord that is the harmony that is between christ and his bride praise the lord just as he was the word she knows that she's an expression of the word he was the express image like paul says in hebrew one she's an expression of the word the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the world praise the lord that's the reason why jesus is saying the father joshua no man but has committed all judgment on to the son and we can go back in kings and see a type of david doing the same because it's already in the world praise the lord we can go back and and see that god has already played out in the word before jesus came and said the father joshua no man but has committed all judgment to the son amen so you see brother i'm saying the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they will be saying has already been said in the word praise the lord they are saying it now come out of come out from amon heard now and be separated the cry has gone out the cry is going out praise the lord how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age praise the lord amen that's the harmony that exists between the father and the son that that that that protection is there because god honor his word god is obligated to his word god will vindicate his word so when we stay with the word still with the message of the hour amen god comes behind that and back it praise the lord now not in a place of word you know where we we we try to to run the church like a boss count and says well let the deacon stand back there you stand back there uh uh uh brother ben and brother danny see those brothers when they're coming look at their haircut you know put them aside let them go and get a haircut they say look at the sisters and you are running the church like a boy scout it's not in the word amen amen praise the lord we must create an atmosphere where the holy ghost can deal with the people where the word can come out of the pages and bring conviction to the human heart oh is it wrong to tell a brother to call his head no it's not wrong it's not wrong but yet the prophet of god said you don't make converts by government christ is the mystery of god reveal you don't make converts by government it's all of those those those little human effort that we try to run god's church by let's start with the word amen in every age we have exactly the same pattern the same that church age that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a setting age and then from the messenger they spread the light through the ministry of others praise the lord who have been faithfully taught amen who has been faithfully taught praise the lord amen it took 10 years for elijah to fit into elijah mentor that is why the lie comes through some god gave a messenger to a set in a certain area and then from that messenger they spread the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken praise the lord i'll tell you if you are running with just a one-line call it's not all that the messenger have said because we have a lot of one-liners they idea and they take away years and soon the message is no longer appeal and the revival dies praise the lord amen because the message is not to to reproduce pentecost praise the lord but the message has the pentecostal blessing amen amen yeah it has the pentecostal blessing it has the pentecost holy girl she has the pentecost gifts all of those things must be there but it's not to reproduce pentecost no the idea to take that and soon the message is no longer pure and the revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of god praise the lord hallelujah since this message is to put a bride in the rapture amen is to get a people ready for the rapture hallelujah i was talking with a dear brother and myself well fellowshipping here yesterday we had some few things to talk about and then we started talking on some other things and then we got down to to the subject broadband mentioned here he says one some of the greatest men of all ages a charles paul james he mentioned smith wiggle wolfing mentioned all of those men there was something we were talking and we got down to that and i told the brother that says i have always marvel at that statement i said because if you realize all of those men that brother brown mentioned as the greatest man they were all men that came under the men's anointing they were all men that were just honored they are the age of the man's anointing praise the lord and those were some of the men that were that wrote some of the greatest christian literature you can ever find i said the thing in there that that we matter mean is just to see how you know you you look at uh honor the the lion anointing uh uh uh that was when uh brother branham said great evangelistical work was done those disciples they saw everything that they had and they were ready to to spread the message the prophet said that was the reason why the holy ghost led him to bring in all the their belongings and lay them at their apostle feet because god was about to take them out scatter them praise the lord people like andrews and and and all of these men they will get on the boat ignoring nobody where they are going to jump on the boat and all their glory in their heart they want to testify of a raising christ they are not going on invitation they are going because the boat has an address that is going to if this boat is traveling to this place i'm going with it i will meet people there praise the lord the first three ages came honor their their that anointing praise the lord and then right after that time the church got on the the dark age persecution break out praise the lord and the church was now under the ox anointing you find people like we said i mean a young old people the love of god was so much in their heart that they were ready to be burned to the stake they were they were ready for a sword to go through their body such an anointing upon them they were just responding to the anointing of the hour praise the lord in the fourth seed brother braham says the church can do nothing but respond to heart anointing glory be to god now yes the age also this man god blessed him god opened a channel of inspiration read the book of john g lakes i was just telling the brother years back there was around 1993-94 that was the first time i came across uh ian bounds book power true prey i took it from a library of a baptist missionary praise the lord and like i told the brother yesterday i said i almost told that book praise the lord i mean that book has such such an impression on me ian bounds talks about uh uh uh you know uh john wesley prayer life man that will spend six hours in praying and he talks about all of these men and and and you know the time they spend before god and why they they are their 10-minute message and 15-minute message was so powerful because they spent more time before god than the time they were spent before man praise the lord amen but you see i i i mean i i mean i read the book and i read it again and i read it again and you know i i tried to memorize my head is not good in keeping things praise the lord i took notebook and i wrote in and you know and and i would just read it and read it and you know and then you know what i i get down there to pray then and i pray then you know and you go there two three hours oh lord like you know i need to go six hours eight hours man you read us kind of a book you just feel ashamed of yourself you read the fastest books of mata yo and see whether those people give you a lot you feel so ashamed what am i doing for god [Music] they responded to their anointing you have to find your anointing for your hour to respond to him and that was how the lord delivered me praise the lord that was how he delivered me it's because i'm reading of men of this gospel that will honor their anointing for their hour praise the lord and the anointing was raising them up in prayer and inspiring them to write books and and i mean these guys right things you you read my goodness praise the lord even even in charles lincoln praise the lord yeah he was he was from he's from that era he's from that era that's the man that uh you know the brother brandon is accused of plagiarizing he's from that era and i can show you i'm working on something i'll show you with him at the appointed time praise the lord because the ministry of the seven angel was to gather the loose ends praise the lord amen was to gather the loose ends and what is that to bring balance to godly teachings to man the high truth but never have balance to bring strictural balance that's the reason why those opening of the seals was one of the greatest time brother brands is the greatest time in my ministry he says because if it was not the help of the angel of the lord every night i would have come out with a wrong interpretation of those seals but every night god will send an angel and says this white house rather is not the holy ghost this is the antichrist why because he has a bald he do not have an arrow praise the lord you see the harmony that was existing between the son and the father it was not only on acne relationship or on friendship or no no no it was a harmony that was based on the word it was a harmony that was based on the word of the sons of of david absalom was the preferred son the bible said he was loved by the people and i also believe that david love him because he was his son praise the lord but you see god's choosing was the son that came from the adulterous woman and god sent his prophet mitten to david to instruct david and absalom will take the throne praise the lord so even if david never had that affection that he had for solomon for for uh that he had for absalom if he never had the same affection for solomon now god has spoken god has spoken what am i saying there because the homily is not based on our human effort amen the way that god is dealing with us in this age is because god has spoken his word and he has sent his spirit to back it up he's going to bring himself a bride praise the lord whether we can uh stand all the the negative thing that is said about the message on that whether we can stand the pressure of the age that does not matter to god he have already spoken praise the lord the bride is just responding to her anointing and what is that anointing revelation 4 1 come up higher you got to step up a little bit in your worship step up a little bit praise the lord you can't continue to just just with that uh uh uh uh day in and day out you got to step up a little bit come up higher that's our call that's our call to the rapture that's our call to the resurrection to come up higher we must be inspired every day to live a better day better life than yesterday we must be inspired every day because that is our call that is the voice of revelation 4 1. come up higher that's brother branham called the rapture that's the place where every message must pull auto that is the place where every experience in our life must pull or to why because that is our anointing if god is allowing us to go through things he is anointing us for us to come up higher for a step away from our own way of thinking and denominational way of thinking family bound word of thinking and step up into the world take the promise of god and say god your words headed i can stand on your word praise the lord oh it's very easy to start another uh an opera room let's let's just that's the 10 days and wait for the promise will you start another pentecostal movement right here on sister 900. praise the lord amen brother branham says we will just be opening ourself we'll be opening ourselves up for evil spirits praise the lord he says you will just be opening yourself up for evil spirit why because there is no promise in the word there is no promise in the word that back's dead praise the lord we are trying to obligate god to go in a reverse when god is moving forward we are saying you have to stop right here you have to go you have to reverse back when an age god has brought us his word it looks so common to the people take the word and apply praise the lord we can only feel that god is moving when we create some sense of emotion praise the lord take the word and move forward that's the bride called that's the anointing of the hour come up higher come up higher praise the lord and god has placed everything in his word to bring us to a higher ground so we have to a higher better relationship with the lord better fellowship better understanding of his word lord bless you we will stop you musicians you can come for those for those that will be back for the community services around 4 4 teddy let's come back and then we we will go right into the service tonight praise the lord [Music] that's right higher ground [Music] brother brown says when we read you read the faucet box of mata he says you look at the life of those early christians [Music] and you say oh god see the things that went through but abraham says they look down to your age and they say wow those believers in laodicea wow we never had to deal with a lot of media power in the air [Music] they are they are they are their spiritual atmosphere is so cloudy [Music] ours is so cloudy praise the lord [Music] those all things are our saints we get down on their knees and pray then and and they will be there the bible says ananias praying right there and god break a vision to him and say i'm sending paul to you praise the lord our age is so clouded that it's hard for us to have a vision because we have it right in our hands called a cell phone we don't find a time to pray we just go search on google and type this one and who is this person and we just handle it right in our hands [Music] if you know how all the media facilities that we have they spend night and night in your bible better brandon will talk about uh susanna wesley how she raised her children with all of those boys that she had i mean you think about it to have 17 rooms with 17 televisions 17 remote control and all the boys can look at whatever movie they want to look at they never had those facilities so what she did every night she sat down they sat there they said before her and she took the bible and starts to read a story and create a picture in your mind and create a picture of about joseph and read about easter and jacob she become she become a television to them but when they look down at our age and see the kind of spirits that we are dealing with see the things that is buffering our mind the thing our young people are fixed up with they say oh my god oh my god i thought my days were bad i thought be fair to the lion were evil but see the thing that laudisha church people minds are going through [Music] as soon as you come from the presence of god an evil 12 slaps your mind that they have a watch in every way to make you to misunderstand things misunderstand someone's action the pressing not meaning any evil to you they just do something you make a conclusion he's a rolling lion visit that's what we are faced with that's the age we are faced with if it is not coming on your phone it's it's it's it's uh it's either on the poster it's in a book it's on a stream i mean it's just all over us it's all around us and then in the midst of this the bible says god has given his angers to to income about us can you feed the spiritual warfare that is going around you when the end when the enemy is there to just destroy your mind not a dead i would go by and you see all the violence a man would take gun on his own children a boy would take gun on his siblings what is happening what what is causing that evil spirit that is screaming to the minds of the people what is causing that evil spirit that is overtaking the people in this age and it's the same spirit that is income about you and myself but god has given angels around you to fight every time change your mind every time your mind is coming on a suppression god where a lie has thought to slip in remember the lord that god he will remember that talk to sleeping and then you will step back but the same evil spirit that is streaming to your mind is also screaming to your mind and if the law was not i will help will be lying in our own blood that's the age that we have to deal with that's the reason why we might not take these things for granted people we might not take these things for granted let's run to calvary if we need god if you need god in your life run to god you can't just
