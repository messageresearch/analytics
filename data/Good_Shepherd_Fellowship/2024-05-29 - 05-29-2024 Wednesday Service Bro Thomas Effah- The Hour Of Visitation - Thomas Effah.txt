Father come now Lord Jesus Come Oh God as as we go into your word come oh God and speak to us Lord open your word to our hearts Lord father bless us in your presence tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you have your [Music] seat once again we said uh God bless you good to be in the house of the Lord I want to read uh there in St John chapter 3 that was where I would preach a r from on Sunday like I said I will have made uh some comments after the service tonight actually I won't be preaching brother brother Thomas will be speaking for us uh on this Wednesday night I just want to read few verses here before our brother come up he came from Vancouver he start to to see us and then he'll be flying out tomorrow so this time just to come and bring the word and and just greet Us Praise the Lord so uh uh brother brother uh uh Paul was speaking on U Sunday talking about walking in the Supernatural and uh uh you know you you get visiting preachers in to to preach you give them the Liberty to preach what is on their heart praise the Lord and uh you know and then we expect that uh as we grow in the Lord we will be able to discern the words amen discern the words sometimes uh you know preacher gets into be a Channel of inspiration and you know they just preach they rebuke they correct they say things but you have to discern what the holy spirit is saying to the church amen and uh and that uh uh uh you know that uh take offense in in the preaching of the word so uh uh but something uh I Tau on that I will I will remind us of uh when we when we come back uh to this to this subject we know that this is uh is uh this in John chapter 3 was one of the time that Jesus ever preached his major Doctrine St John chapter 3 was a major doctrine that Jesus spoke on and you know what is beautiful about this chapter as I read it and uh uh Jesus never preached this in the synagogues he never preach it to the leat he preach it to the preacher praise the Lord because if there is ever a people that need to be born again is we preachers praise the Lord he was talking to Nicodemus he was he was a ruler he was uh uh uh the leader of the people the ruler of the Jews he said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of uh of God verse four Nicodemus said unto him how can a man uh uh uh said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter you see that is one of the hardest thing you know to be able to come out of a system to be able to come out of tradition praise the Lord amen coming out is one thing but having that thing to come out of us is another thing praise the Lord Nicodemus first mind was going back into the wom going back into his traditional wom going back into uh uh his Pharisee womb but this is what that is that is uh that is uh uh amazing in the in the chapter here that I wanted to show to you because like I said Jesus Jesus uh this was a major doctrine that he uh that he spoke of and uh uh he he actually interpret what the new birth is praise the Lord he actually taugh us what a new birth is and he will say year uh in verse 11 he says uh uh verily I said unto you uh verily verily I say unto the we speak that which we do know and testify that which we have seen and have received uh uh and yet receive not our witness if I have told you everything things you and yeah believe not how shall ye believe if I tell you Heavenly things no man listen to this now no man have ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven that's the new birth praise the Lord that is the New Birth the church has tried to interpret the new birth as conforming we believe this you know when you dress like us when you when you do this like us when you confess this like us Jesus talking about the new birth year he interprets what the new birth is I read that again no man have ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven praise the Lord is a birth from above amen praise the lord it's a birth that identify us with our Tani which is our our our original man praise the Lord hallelujah no man ha ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man while he's on Earth why he standing there on Earth he said even the son of man which is in heaven praise the Lord so you see it's it's a supernatural life that's why Paul would say we are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what put us there is that new birth it makes the believer has a doal life amen he's on Earth but yet he's in heaven that's what the new birth is the new birth is not joining church it's not even believing that brother brandham is a prophet it's not being baptized in Jesus name the new birth is a son of man is a Son of God is a daughter of God Amen it's a daughter of God is a Son of God that while they are yet on Heaven yet on Earth there is a Heavenly po there is a Heavenly influence there is a Heavenly desire praise the Lord there is a Heavenly control on their life son of man here on in Earth but yet in heaven amen that's why he said he that is born of the flesh is flesh he that is born eff is eff and he that is born Heavenly is Heavenly praise the Lord so I pray that uh we will not take all the time of the preacher tonight but I pray that uh uh uh we will we will realize and identify that that uh there there is a Heavenly p on the life of a Believer amen it's a Heavenly p on the life of the believer while we are here uh uh on Earth while we are here uh we have to go to work we have to go to school and we have to you know go to the grocery make our choices clean you know everything that we have to do because you see we really don't go to heaven before uh uh we our eternal life begins here that's what the new birth is that's what the Holy Ghost is the churches teaches that you have to die and then before you go and have that internal reward but for the believer it begins here and when we look more into this it becomes interesting because heaven is the opening of the word Heaven is identifying your purpose from the word under the four seeds he says Heaven consists of the word we are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that was on my mind I will have said more of that on Sunday but I just felt like more of the time was taken and uh I will let you go but uh I will not let the subject go amen it says M that I say unto you ye must ye must it's a matter of M praise the lord it's a matter of or as we would not see understand the things concerning to the kingdom you will just you would just leave one Church system and go back into another church system that's that's how that's how Nicodemus understood the new ver should I go back to my mother's home should I leave this church and go to this church should I leave this one and go to that one no Jesus was talking about a birth we was talking about an experience an experience that makes you to know that this word is not your home you are just a pagin and you are a stranger you're looking for a city who maker and better is God you love the Lord tonight praise the Lord amen walking in the Supernatural that's that's the life of the believer that's the life of the believer every every day every every day our everyday life is Supernatural It's Supernatural because if you realize that how many de demon powers is Waring against you praise the Lord how many demon power is streaming to your mind is trying to get your attention you realize that your everyday life is a supernatural life praise the Lord just to order our steps to be in the house of the Lord on Wednesday night after coming from work and different things that you we've been doing I mean it's it's just it's just easy to find an excuse and sit back and relax and and and and and uh uh you know watch your favorite movie or whatever whatever you know your hobby is but that Supernatural desire to be in Fellowship come and lift out our hands just to say we thank you I bless your name oh Lord we are grateful to be in the house of the Lord let's stand tonight we will allow brother brother Thomas to come in and uh minister to us tonight uh uh so we will take the time and start preaching to you tonight there the two drops of Mercy are brought shine all around us by day and by night oh yes Jesus the light of the oh yes we will walk yes we walk in the light s shall you take full light come where the few drops of Mercy are bright shine up better Thomas [Music] amen amen I believe somebody is walking in [Music] the the light will never be on earth if people are not ready to walk in the light is here because sons of God are here Darkness has taken a hold of the world but the evening light is here amen amen so the SS of God will make it home nothing can hold we have the light amen and Jesus said when you have the light walk in the light so I believe there are people here walking in the light can you sing that once more for me you walk in the light [Music] where [Music] you sh on around by might and by J let us pray Heavenly Father we are most grateful that Lord you extended such love to V People Like Us we were not worthy for the worthy one to take our place father it is all some because of predestination and we are grateful that millions are living in sin today but because of your adoption you have adopted us into Sons and Daughters of god father we are privileged we are here because you want us to come into your presence father come and reveal yourself in your word we are hungry Souls here tonight and I believe you break the bread in your own special way father thank you for the opportunity granted unto your servant Lord it is all about Jesus Lord we love you come and bless our hearts in Jesus Christ Christ name amen okay while we are standing maybe you have to you can take your Bible with me and uh you just read a test I'm taking my test from The Book of Luke Luke chapter 19 Luke 19 43 and to 45 43 to 45 for the days shall come upon thee that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee and Compass thee run and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and th children with thee and they shall not live in thee one stone upon another because th knowe not the time of th visitation and uh he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought may the Lord are blessing to read of his word you can have BL it for now I want to speak on the subject the hour of visitation the hour of visitation the Lord bless each one of you and I thank my friend bran for any time I knock at his door regardless maybe situation may be difficult he always open the doors for me I thank him very much for doing that and that is the respect that we can show to one another when you can open your puppet for a minister the respect you have to have confidence in the one that you give you the p because Sons and Daughters of God are pies they pict with an expensive price so when we coming into your presence like this it's not a joke it is a serious business who boast that he's a preacher sometimes I see people oh I can preach brother when you see somebody boasting he can preach there's something wrong with him said bring him to The Altar and pray for him the Holy Ghost preached the word that is why it's important when we are coming here we pray that God set us aside and let the gift come and operate and when the gift is in operation then you'll be pulling from Jesus you not pull for aen so this evening I believe you have prayed for me at the grace of God I know God will set me aside and he will come and minister to his bride the hour of visitation it is important to know your visitation if you and someone book an appointment and then he promise and give you a time that you will be coming you at such and such time you'll be in expectation yes you'll be waiting for him at that time because he has promised to visit around that very moment so you are in expectation now this Bible that we cherish most we must be very very careful how we look into the word of God and what we see if our eyes are not anointed you see wrong things but if your eyes are anointed that's why said you must read the Bible with the eyes of God in Satan's hiding and if you are reading it with the eyes of God you'll see exactly what God was talking about that is why he said I will anoint your eyes he knows the problem God knows what we were going to go through and he found the situation in lusia he said you supposed to buy of me our to anoint your eyes to see what God want you to see the hour of visitation now Israel when God chose Abraham go was waking another Masterpiece because the first Master Masterpiece has been mad has been destroyed Satan got in and Destroy God's Masterpiece Adam so God has to work another Masterpiece so he got Abraham it is not Abraham because he was a good man no but God saw something in Abraham that he himself put it right there that when I call Abraham at the appointed time he will hear my voice so it was God that placed it right in him that is why you are you are sitting on that seat you are not here to occupy a seat you are here to take your place in Jesus Christ you are set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and brother said where is the believer's position your position is in Jesus Christ so friends when Abraham heard the voice of God he could not stri it is just a striking Affair he heard his voice because that voice was already placed in him B said the foundation stone has already been placed in the bride when God was laying this Foundation he plac a stone in you and that stone of Revelation is placing you that any word of God you will say Amen to that because there is something that is pulling the Rock in you rock upon rock rock upon Rock we are building a perfect structure that is why every age there is no way you can miss your message you can miss it the hour of visitation go to Abraham that Abraham you SE will s joing in hisra land but I will visit them at appointed time 400 years I will visit them amen God wanted to train his children yes he's not a wicked God he want to give us training to exhibit to demonstrate his love for you to know that God loves you sometime he permit you to go through fire he permit you to go through rain he permit you to go through terrible times because you're a Son of God said when God is dealing with his child he's not killing him he's training you but sometimes it is on Pleasant but you stay right there it will come out better amen the hour of visitation now listen Jeremiah he told Israel because God has appointed Prophet to them to warn them to speak to them so that they don't get anything missing or anything misplaced God appointed prophets to them read Jeremiah 8:12 were they ashamed when they had committed Abominations no they were not all ashamed neither could they brush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down say the Lord that is the prophet isah all his said they never brush when they sin they could not brush every Son of God you have to come into the place of go and brush it is time of brush it is time of erasing our sins in the blood of Jesus Christ so they have gone to Egypt 400 years has expired we know the story how they refuse their visitation when God appointed Moses to them the deliver Moses knew his commission you sit right there you supposed to know why you in the church amen you're supposed to know why you're here God has placed responsibility in each one of us amen this man will stand here facing his responsibility not because he's here I I respect him very man you are Pastor I'm a missionary I've seen many things maybe you look at me I'm not but let me tell you I've seen many things in this message amen cuz I'm traving all over the world you have got a good pastor may God bless your pastor said it's a gift for you it's not because you're here because I I know the discernment help us to know to test everyone's Spirit when I speak to I know what is in you amen amen amen friends they refuse their visitation Moses after he went to the camp to use his own strength because he felt that OD that responsibility on him to deliver his people he saw how Egypt was suppressing his own people he said not in my presence when you come into the presence of God and you are anointed you will never allow any foolishness to go you will stand on your feet and challeng the enemy regardless of whatever situation you equ with that anointing that is where golad has to make his his last brag in the M preparation said go he did it for his last time because he did it in the presence of a wrong man that day Joseph was there amen we want the enemy to be to warn him one Satan is my friend as long as I live as long as the Holy Ghost is in me you cannot you cannot do those game in my presence I am a child of God that's right that's right that's right you must know your identity that's right [Music] yes the hour of visitation he said when Grace is refused judgment stri now does God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him 93 paragraph all right we found out the first he sent his prophet with warning he doesn't change his way his method of doing things he does not always strike when he wants he wants you to watch he want you to watch this quotation God gives a warning but he don't always strike the same time he wants but you you notice that and then when he doesn't strike when he send a warning then the prophet is [Music] Mo you didn't have it you told a lie you wasn't right because he didn't strike at that same moment you know what what is going on we are waiting for the wrath of God but people are mocking oh a liive nothing will happen the world has be 2,000 oh no nothing will happen you people you don't know what you are talking about you talking Heaven just enjoy the world and die and go your way you are talking of Heaven they don't know what they talking about because God never strive by you stri amen Ahab refus warning nebuchad refus warning noest people refuse warning and they mock they thought it was a lie but when that visitation counts on them because they refuse salvation visit when you refuse salvation visitation you will really endure visitation of rra that why you cannot Escape can escape that one you can refuse Grace but but you cannot refuse judgment so now listen that is why you have to come to church brother the reason you come to church is to be yourself yes by the preaching of the word you sit in your home you listen to the table you read the message you read the Bible you have to get a pastor anointed man to put you in your place your position and to shape you with the sword when there is anything wrong he has to take the sword of God said you a stone indeed but a stone that is not caught and put into its appropriate place you'll be a rolling stone and the Rolling Stone doesn't make the building we put you there you roll and you fall we have to cut you and cutting is not pleasant that's why many people run away from church yes when you come to church the pastor will take the sword and cut you you think he's wounding you yes cutting is not pleas but he's putting you your R if he doesn't cut you fall down you'll fall back amen he has to cut you and shape you and put you in your place amen amen that is his business to cut you as a son and daughter of God the hour of visitation now look at in the days of Daniel Daniel 8:3 then I heard one Saint speaking and another Saint said unto the other certain Saint which spake you see it was not Angels Saints watch what Daniel is seeing here it is Saint Not Angels when we talk Saint we are the Saints but one Saint was speaking to another Saint how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of the solution to give both the sanctuary and the most holy to be troen and the food and he said unto me unto 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be C now Israel they're supposed to know that iniquity of Jacob must be wiped away if anything God could do with them iniquity must be washed away first because God has to abolish sin he has to give us a Son of God the Lamb of God not a lamb that cover cover sin but the lamb that take away sin that is why we are we are in a very good security we are in a very good Zone we are secure because our sins have been blotted out the sin you do tomorrow has been blotted out tomorrow the that you do let me tell you if you're a child of God you must have that confidence otherwise the enemy will come and trick you around because a Son of God if he go or if he fall into any error there is no way his heart will not condemn him or her if you indeed a child of God you are heart to condemn you there the reason he put the Holy Ghost in you if your heart doesn't condemn you then you must praise the Lord my heart is strong it's a wrong heart you need condemnation the Bible say if you judge yourself God will not judge you we need a holy ghost to judge us that's why the Holy Ghost is given the hour of visitation now when s ask another sin where where is it going to be when the daily sacrifice will be taken what is the daily sacrifice the people were very they were very much interested in killing animals and eating meat and all this kind of stuff they were interested in those things and you me that the priest will not go and then kill the Sheep again you said this that we are making business you mean it is going to cease amen they didn't want that sacrifice to ceas because they making business out of life how they sell sheep how they sayell go how they were making big business and you mean the daily sacrifice we seiz amen that's his business now I said in this message let me read what the prophet said here but there was a time this is revelation 5 part 1 there was a time of the cleansing of the sanctuary when it was a judgment seat as long as the blood was off of the seed as long as the blood of Jesus is still on the seed is a mercy seed that is why you are a Mery seed today because the blood is on you you are the AR God is living in you that is the the reason you show Mercy you don't call for God's Wrath you a mercy seat because the blood is still on you but when the blood is taken away when the bread is ruptured there will be no blood it will be cler the Bible say cler CLE nothing no blood will be found on the altar there will be no atonement again it's finished now said now we approaching that time now we are approaching in this age a cleansing of the sanctuary and the Judgment coming upon the Earth you see as long as blood is there God cannot destroy the Earth as long as blood is there nobody nobody is a sinner before God as long as the blood is there God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him will not perish that right and what did John say this is the lamp of God that take away the sins of the he did not say the sins of the Bride the sins of the world Hallelujah that is why BR said the reason people be judged is because they refuse their representative you are not going to be judged because you are a sinner you are going to be judged because you refuse your representative Jesus stood for you he died for everybody he was no selective that is why nobody can really stand in the presence of God at the judg may see it and then you you you appreciate you thank God you are a righteous judge everybody will thank God he will say go to hell you you praise him God you you are a righteous judge there's no one that is going to Bluff or going to accuse God on that day everyone will appreciate he has given everybody opport to repent the warning is coming for that is the visitation your visitation is today God is visiting you maybe you are battling with some challenges this is your day you have to overcome that challenge because God will give you the ability the power to overcome that is why you come to church to be encouraged to get Faith the hour of visitation the lamb the Messiah the prince should come and should be for 70 weeks and 70 that that 70 years that was prophesied to his people and the prince will be cut off in the midst that's three three and a half years of the seven years and then and the daily sacrifice will be done at away with and the Abomination that make it desolate that is the Muslim M of Omar stood on the temple grounds that day when they bur the temple and then there is three and half years yet left to Israel amen they refused their visitation when Jesus was right with them they they could not see the ense the purpose of God coming to them in flesh the Father Abraham saw his visitation when God became free he took D the 16 elements God come down he took the C element made a temple made a temple made a temple three of them jump in these temples they walk to Abraham God in human flesh that was the visitation that was the last son Abraham supposed to see before Isaac God walking to his prophet in human flesh you understand in Abraham there is no nothing between him and God that will be let left loose he is always connected with God consciously always looking for the presence of God my my friend if only you are very conscious about God you are conscious about the Holy Ghost very sensitive he will speak he is always on speaking terms he's not far away look at Israel when they were testing and they were crying The Rock was still with them The Rock was in speaking terms with them but they have really left the rock oh god of Mercy the hour of visitation now listen there is coming a day that because Israel they could not see their visitation Jesus told them because you refuse to know your visitation this building of Solomon you are showing to me a stone will not rest upon a stone it will all be brought down and we are going to suffer this and they said let the blood come upon Earth you see what the suffering Israel is suffering today they call for it but the only favor we can do to Israel is to get oursel ready and move out from this Earth if you don't go Israel will still suffer we have to go and let Jesus visit them and show them his palms and let them recognize the Messiah they rejected but you and I we don't want to go we not ready to live this earth like Moses was not ready to leave fellow parat he was comfortable but God has to put pressure on him in this conv zones I'm telling you God will put pleasure on us and then you know that what is in you will be groaning he said we the the fful we are groaning look looking for adoption groing all creation is also growing we are also growing if you are not growing start to grown if you not weeping start to weep so Moses he has to kill an Egyptian and when he killed an Egyptian God was sitting in the wilderness laughing this man of God is say yeah Pharaoh is chasing this guy now he kill an Egyptian sometime God will put some pressure and it will run you to God run you the hour was come for God to visit Israel because they rejected Moses they had to count another 30 years that is what we are dealing with friends we are here suffering on this a because we have refused our visitation it is time for us to be a get this awareness this Consciousness because God has visited us at this age our Prophet Willam abam he is not don't don't don't don't don't don't put him as an ordinary man he was a v that Jesus himself used Jesus himself Christ used that Temple the things that did on Earth he said even God was had success in brother Ministry than when Jesus was here he said it he said now let me tell you you are greater than the Old Testament prophets friends let us not joke with our visitation our eyes have seen God in flesh How could a man he will tell you your address your number your name where you your car number your hotel number How could a man do this the pro this is the day of our visitation you the Gentiles that is why in this day this scriptures fulfilled you know he turned his back to the congregation he said you the Gentiles you are saying your sign the sign that Abraham saw when he sat in his his T and Elohim come to him in flesh sat with him his back was just behind the the tent but Elohim could know what was in Sarah's heart and Jesus come he does the same sign for them to recognize him they refuse that's why john8 Jesus told them your father Abraham he saw me he rejoiced he washed my feet he gave me food but you you saw me you want to kill me and you say you are Abraham's seed you say you're a bride you say you're a Believer and you don't want to really line up with the word of God you don't want to be an example you don't want to be a same a same post for people to read friends we must wake up you have to wake up now when the time was right Moses when he went to the Wilderness God has to call his servant and then let him know that scripture there was a scripture vindicating at that to be Vindicated at that time Moses Moses he was attracted by fire said when there is fire let fire explode in this church everybody will run here to see fire we want to see fire you want to see the Holy Ghost burning in people's heart you want to see you operating perfectly where God has placed you every one of you has got gift sitting in you God never calls you in vain he calls for a responsibility therefore why don't you really drive towards that you must ask God where do you call me Lord have you go have you been on your knees have you cried have you been on your KNE praying Lord where should you bring me to this fult where should you bring me to this what you have me to do for you Lord have you ever prayed that prayer friends you need to know why you are here if you don't care to know there will be problem in the church every day because you would know your position and if somebody is doing what God has committed to you you'll be Crossing its path you'll be you you'll be Crossing his because you don't know what you are called for if you know your position you'll be in land and it will be a blessing to the church Moses when he he saw the fire it attracted bra said in uncertain sound he said if there is fire a lot of Moses will be attracted if you can see fire amen now Daniel told them the sacrifice will be taken away because Jesus Will abort he's coming to eradicate sin there is no need for any sacrifice again you don't need to kill any animal again is No need fall again now he told them that this walls and this Temple that you are showing me will will be brought down and the Muslim of the Muslim the M of om will be in his place that's where Jerusalem the Muslims they want to CL they want to claim East Jerusalem where Mah will be coming from the East Gate that's the problem and it is Israel that has allowed these things to happen but thank God God is in it all he will prove that he is God of Israel friends that is why I love n he speak scripturally he said let the whole world stand against Israel even if it is our fingers we will fight let America not bring any arms said even their fingers use and fight brother we are talking of Jehovah now they were warned and I want to tell you friends you must recognize Jesus Christ when he comes to yourself said when Jesus visited your did you recognize him when you were in s you were kept in Satan cell in the message Victory Day paragraph 289 Heavenly Father we are grateful and I Lord I am so indepted to you there is no way I could ever pay the debt of my sin I was in a Cell a prison one day because I was was born in that prison I was born in that cell and I know what Freedom meant and the price was so great I couldn't pay it but I am so glad that the day that you visit me in my cell I recognize it the day he visited you in yourself can't you see the visitation of Jesus Christ where should go brought bring me here right here why what is my mission here where should this man open door for me to pre to you where should you sit on the seat to listen to this message isn't not for the cause friends he brought a p to yourself how many people there were many people in the same C but how many people received him when he handed over the pardon that was your visitation look at John chapter 5 this importent man that has laid that 38 years he saw his visitation he recognized his day said Master I've been in this condition 38 8 Years sir but I am not Disturbed anytime the angel comes I'll make effort I'll go again one day it will be my day one day Master it will be my day Jesus said what has been your problem he said I have no man people always carry their importent ones and throw them in the in the water I have no man Jesus said but do you know the man that is talking to you the very angel that trouble the water was right there you don't need to go to the water the healing will come to you the water will come to you that is Jesus Christ standing beside this impotent man he recognized visitation said Master do you care to be healed said Master I've been here 38 yes and there is no provided way except this pool that's God has provided that's why I'm here nothing can take me back home I will remain here until I get healed when you see a man of faith brother don't joke with that man you are talking of Faith said when Faith speaks everything shut up because he's the boss when you see somebody speaking and he knows what he's talking about he know where he's anchored the hour of visitation Ram said look at bimos he said bimos he sto the s o n bimos stop the Son of God and then Joshua stopped the S you Amen Let you find that and read for you it is time for us to know exactly what we are here for you don't come to church just to add to the number let me tell you honestly that is not why you are here you have a place now in a message BL BOS 50 that is St number 6102 0124 paragraph 5 Joshua stopped the s n by faith but btim stopped the s o n by faith and the same faith will bring him from Glory where he controls the solar system and the universe will bring him down into this Tabernacle tonight that same childlike fith he stop and still still look around they brought him over he said your faith has healed you be he saw his visitation he has set in the church the priest has preached to him they preach Isaiah 35 when Messiah come the brand shall see and btim said amen that is a good seron he said amen but when Messiah was going to Jericho and he heard that Messiah was passing by let me tell you let Messiah not pass over you let it not pass by you you have to will receive what you are here for they stop him you are important you are a sick man keep quiet people are saying hallelujah we also saying hallelujah people are saying son of David you also saying son of David you can shut my mouth that is why nobody can stop preaching B said show me show me who I can show you where God commissioned this man to preach you also show me where God stop him show me where God stop him then people prefer to sit at home they don't want to go to church and you tell me that you're a Christian you lack something he sto Jesus Christ because the message was good and he said amen so when Jesus passed by that was his visitation he could not allow it to sleep by he cried brother don't allow Jesus to pass over you it is a it is a a chance for you to receive from Jesus Christ son of David have mercy on me his voice penetrated through the crowd when they believe even speaking the Bible said in the Days of Thunder I will hear you when it is thundering God will hear your voice he knows your voice he stopped they say master you have cried so loud the master is calling you what is your problem Lord my eyes said receive your side Hallelujah the hour of visitation zakos he has really debating the issue with the wife said several days there was a debate in the home my wife I have seen fake Messiah I don't need to see another one I'm okay with them fake ones every day people come and Proclaim mesiah mesiah but we have seen fake said husband please go and look at this one go and see this one and then if he's one of them add it to your list said he sneak when he saw Rebecca sleeping Rebecca closed the eyes said he's he's asleep just sneak out that was the day of his visitation that day he saw a genine mesiah he saw Christ and when he fell from the tree at the feet of Jesus Christ he said Lord I am a sinner when you come into His presence you'll be exposed you can't hide nothing can hide you rather like we were thinking you need the light to shine on you Darkness has to give way for light to shine in your heart they not sons of Darkness we are sons of Light the hour of visitation look at the Sham woman she was very kind to the prophet he said husband let us fix a small room for this man of God I perceive that he is a man of God what do you perceive about this message have you perceived anything do you perceive that this message is a truth that woman perceiv that that man was a prophet and he fixed him a small room that was the hour of her visitation there was no child in that house but because he fixed a room for the Prophet The Prophet said we have seen many things this woman he said hey I I am okay I have money I have everything I don't need anything I'm I'm in my own country but Gaz he said there is no child in this house that was what the woman lack God knows your lack and if you approach it correctly you receive it he knows our lack he said what Moses lack was in the burning bush what Peter lack was in the upper room what you lack is in the message you understand when the boy died this woman she was so convinced that that see the God has produced a son he said my husband I will never bury this boy I will only bury this boy with that the Lord that the Lord produce this boy I will bury this boy with that the without that say the Lord I will look for the man of God desperation you have to look for God the hour of visitation you will not find the man of God it is not Sabbath it's not new moon it is not he said God will prosper my way and indeed he found a man of God is everything okay all is well later when he come to know that the boy was dead and lat on his bed and you said all is well he said yes all is well as long as I am in the presence of the Prophet all is well all is well take my stuff run don't stop for any man if people greet you don't greet them anyone that salute you don't turn run lay my stuff on the boy but the woman said Prophet it's not staff issue it is not staff we are not dealing with stff here as the Lord leave it I want to hear that said the Lord and when the head was moving the prophet told him run first don't stop for anyone because you have a message you also have message for the dead this day generation Minnesota you this your community people are dying in sin you have a message let us carry a message to the dead and it's an urgent Commission carry it in your compound tell somebody about Jesus Christ carry the message to the dead and don't stop and talk about politics don't stop and talk about business go straight when Andrew saw Jesus when Phillip saw Jesus he did not tell Nat Nat how are the crops the crops doing how is the farm how is the how is everything how is no no no no no he went straight I have found him I have found him the hour of visitation said God is using three bodies the first body God used he created it got into the body walked to Abraham the second body was the spoken word body he spoke it Mary thou shall conceive and bear a son spoking word creative the people could not understand how this will happen but the scripture has SP it Bly a virin shall conceive scripture why did they miss it said sometime when God is doing any anything he do it in a way for cries to to get their place so if you are here in this church to God will give room for you to get lot of things to criticize here because that is why we here if God have chosen a virgin that was not a spous they will have believed see how God Did It Before Adam could go to Eve Satan went ahead before Joseph could go to Mary God went ahead he did it the same way the same way that is why they could not believe it because they thought Joseph was telling a lie and when Joseph even thought Mary has played that is the cheat on him the angel said Joseph that son of David don't do that look at the scripture my wife is carrying the Holy Ghost you understand and Joseph that was the silence him but to the CRI when Jesus was preaching to them they said we are not born of fornication like you we we are not born of for like you you beel you are a Samaritan you have a devil dear Messiah is the same thing people are doing to today this is the thir Temple God has used God use that is Creative Body spoken word body and redeemed body a sinner will BR body a sinner my body God redeemed the body to use it that's always tell us friends I'm also a sinner like you saved by grace but he has a special business he has a special office that none of us can fit into that office don't try to imitate him God call him for special Duty for this age for we Abraham Royal seed to see see God in flesh the son of man that is why God is revealing to you your eyes are anointed to see the message of your day when Jesus was on Earth he told the disciples don't go to the way of the Gentiles it is not their day to see Messiah so they did not come the way of the Gentiles Matthew chapter 10 read that he stopped them but when it go to the time for our visitation God has to get a man to reveal to us the mysteries of godliness you understand that is why Paul could not know Jesus Christ when Jesus was in flesh because Paul was a messenger to the Gentiles and we were not supposed to see Jesus in flesh we are supposed to see Jesus in the spirit that's why Paul also have to see Jesus in the spirit he was our messenger he hit him on the way of Damascus that was his visitation I want everyone of us to have that experience brother if God have never hit you down you not understand what we are talking about you need a strike God has to strike you and then when you fall down then you ask him who are th he say I am Jesus when he reveal himself to you in that manner something will hold you we'll be closing very soon friends can you see your visitation can you see that God has visited it in this age he has come Among Us in the body of brother Bram but let nobody make any God of No let us not do that people I went to India people were trying to do that in India and even many places they doing it but you don't do that he's he's our brother God wanted us to see Messiah we the Gentiles that is why he has to bring him to reveal the Mysteries to us he said you the Gentiles this is your day for you to see Christ in flesh so we are not going to abuse this privilege like the people that don't have Revelation that is why God has given us Revelation to understand these things the hour of visitation God told that is Israel when they were in Egypt he said God will surely visit you Joseph told them God will surely visit you so when you will be going go with my bones don't leave my bones here he knew that God will visit Israel and when the visitation came they packed the bones of Joseph abam said the an he said that is what is happening today now the body of Jesus Christ is lying there as long as the Angels always see the body as long as God always look at the body he knows there will be a day of visitation one of the is this he will jump into that glorified body again and meet us in the sky this is your visitation friends Rebecca saw it when he saw elizah he had the mind of elzar we we have the mind of Christ because we are the bride of Christ Ela prayer how could Rebecca know what Eliza prayed about but he did perfectly I'll give you water and I will give you animals also say yes that is the lady that is the Bride of Isaac we have the mind of Christ like Corinthians to friends the hour has come for the Antichrist he's he's unleashing all his owns slaugh this is the time for the bride to be awakened Satan is on Earth let us arise let everyone arise Let It Be prayerful let the Holy Ghost take over your life let the Holy Ghost take over us and let us see how we relate one another it's not a time to fight it's time to love love your brother even if he's in the wrong help him that is why God has given the Holy Ghost we are going to pray if you never gone to the upper room yet you have never got the experience Jesus told them that I will visit you don't move away from Jerusalem there will be a visitation who is ready to pray tonight God is here to address all issues whatever is the problem there is no human being in this flesh that you don't have problem this one we are in a battle but the solution is in the hands of Jesus Christ he will hold you friend Jesus loves you he will hold you by his right hand and nothing can get you loose those that wait upon the Lord shall [Music] renew yes they shall Mount out with winds as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall and all Fai teach me Lord teach me Lord to those that wait upon the Lord sh renew their strength they shall Mount up with winds as a [Music] eag they shall and all be weary they shall and all fail Teach Me Lord teach me Lord we are going to talk to Jesus this is the hour of visitation he to address all issues only pour your spirit before him just consecrate your life just open up the prophet said when Jesus knocked at your door and you refuse him when you knock at the door of Heaven you also be refused it's a knock a knock at your door this moment when you when this knock is attended to when you respond to this knock there will be a day you also knock at his door and because you gave him access he also give you access I want you to talk to Jesus talk to him
