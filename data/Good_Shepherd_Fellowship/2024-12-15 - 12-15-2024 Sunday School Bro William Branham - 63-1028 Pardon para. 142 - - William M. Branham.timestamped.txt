[4:08] who is any sweeter than the old priest
[4:10] who is any greater than their priest he
[4:13] comes to you when you're born if he's a
[4:15] fuss the neighborhood he comes and
[4:16] settles it and he's always a peacemaker
[4:18] he's a loving man you know he is when
[4:20] you're in trouble you can go to him he
[4:22] helps you what about an nice man then
[4:24] speaking of this Jesus of Nazareth this
[4:26] priest we know who his father was his
[4:29] father's father father's father's father
[4:30] we got a school here that identifies him
[4:33] who is this Jesus of Nazareth what
[4:35] school did he come from what
[4:37] organization is he belong to what does
[4:40] he do but always fussing what does he
[4:42] say about that gentle old priest of
[4:44] yours he's of the devil Jesus said you
[4:47] you're the the devil is your father and
[4:50] his works you'll do could you imagine he
[4:52] went up in the temple looked up on the
[4:54] people with anger kicked over the uh
[4:56] sacrifices that Jehovah required and
[4:58] screamed out it's written my father's
[5:00] house has made a house of prayer and
[5:02] youve made it a dend of Thieves what
[5:04] would he do today if he come to our
[5:05] modern churches there'd be some more
[5:07] table moving there'd be some more H
[5:09] jumping or t to
[5:13] Pieces it would be the same thing don't
[5:16] you see Jesus is very scriptural he was
[5:19] the word he had not to write anything he
[5:22] was the word he was the Living Word and
[5:24] the people failed to recognize it and
[5:27] how can a man today upon the principle
[5:30] of what Jesus Promised these signs to
[5:32] all the world and this blessing to all
[5:34] the world and the Holy Ghost to fall
[5:36] just like it did in the beginning on
[5:38] whosoever God would call how can a man
[5:40] call himself a Christian and deny that
[5:42] word and say the holy spirit's in him
[5:44] amen the Holy Spirit Will punctuate
[5:46] every word of God with an amen that's
[5:49] exactly right oh brother our Educational
[5:52] Systems has draw us away from it and
[5:54] there are are denominations that
[5:55] separate us from one another and from
[5:57] Christ but what they continue to do that
[6:00] and you take a subtitute any other thing
[6:03] is no more than fig leaves again God
[6:05] rejects it but when the church comes
[6:07] under the blood of Jesus Christ with a
[6:09] token of the Holy Spirit upon them then
[6:11] you're going to see Brotherhood again
[6:13] you're going to see a church full of
[6:14] power you're going to God hates a
[6:16] powerless religion it's got to be power
[6:20] certainly it's a power to save a man
[6:22] from sin it's a power that can do signs
[6:26] and wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ
[6:28] promised they zeroed in on the word of
[6:31] God back there and believed it it hit
[6:32] the target you zero the same way on the
[6:34] word of God and it hit the target again
[6:36] it's got to because he's the same
[6:38] yesterday today and forever God don't
[6:40] like a powerless religion God does not
[6:43] want that God wants to perform God wants
[6:48] to show himself alive our very hopes is
[6:51] the
[6:53] resurrection is that right our hopes of
[6:56] life is Resurrection the resurrection of
[6:59] Jesus Christ you see God wants to work
[7:03] in this church Jesus said I'll be with
[7:05] you always even to the end of the world
[7:08] the works that I do shall you do also St
[7:11] John 12:14 The Works that I do shall you
[7:14] do also even more than this shall you do
[7:17] for I go to my father now the church
[7:19] tries to deny that to get away to get
[7:22] more members to be more popular now I
[7:25] want to ask you something the God is
[7:28] trying to perform perform in his church
[7:31] and the church is trying to perform by
[7:33] the Creed and the two can't work
[7:35] together you've got to get rid of the
[7:38] Creed and get Christ in and how can you
[7:40] do it when he sees the blood when the
[7:42] blood has been applied with a sincere
[7:45] heart and a hand laid Upon Jesus Christ
[7:47] and a heart that's true before God to
[7:50] confess his wrong and be borned of the
[7:52] Holy Spirit then the works of God would
[7:54] follow as he said it would do yeah
[7:56] Church wants to perform through the
[7:58] Creeds the see enemy members that can
[7:59] get God wants to perform through the
[8:02] power of the blood to get Christians
[8:03] born again that's exactly the difference
[8:05] of do you must hum must reject to do
[8:08] this they you've got to reject the Holy
[8:11] Spirit and his performing power to
[8:14] accept the Creed you have to see the
[8:17] truth before you can accept an error if
[8:20] you're going to be a Christian you can't
[8:22] you have to walk over God's promise and
[8:25] order to get an arrow because there's a
[8:27] red light flashing before you all the
[8:29] time this is the word they say well that
[8:32] was for some other day it's for today
[8:35] because Christ is the word is that right
[8:38] St John 1 in the beginning was the word
[8:40] and the word is with God and the Word
[8:41] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[8:44] dwelt Among Us and the Bible said he's
[8:46] the same yesterday today and forever so
[8:48] if Christ is the word every promise is
[8:51] true and it's the same yesterday today
[8:53] and forever it has to be it takes a born
[8:56] again Faith to believe it and make it
[8:58] operate just you can't do it with
[9:00] tradition it won't work you've got to
[9:03] come to that blood just as sure as
[9:04] anything after Israel told after Isaiah
[9:08] told Israel that they had polluted their
[9:10] substitute by their Traditions there
[9:12] appeared another Prophet before we Clos
[9:14] another great prophet come on the scene
[9:17] that was John the
[9:18] baptizer now he pointed them to a lamb
[9:22] that would take would do not only for
[9:24] Israel but all of Adam's Fallen race he
[9:28] said there was God was go to send a lamb
[9:31] and this lamb would be for Gentile Jew
[9:33] and whosoever would come it wasn't very
[9:36] long until the lamb was nailed to his
[9:38] alter cross his blood was shed the Holy
[9:42] Spirit came back now when the old animal
[9:45] lamb died the spirit of the animal could
[9:48] not come back so that blood was just
[9:50] applied to a nation but now for all of
[9:53] Adam's race the Lamb of God that was
[9:56] shed his blood the token came back in
[9:59] the form of the Holy Spirit to come upon
[10:01] the worshipper now that's what God
[10:03] requires that's what they did at that
[10:05] day and that's what they they do today
[10:08] now if any person feels the weight of
[10:11] sin and you know that you're wrong
[10:14] listen there is pardon and that pardon
[10:18] is through God's
[10:20] lamb do you believe that amen it's
[10:23] through the lamb through the blood of

[13:57] bruised for a i iniquity the
[14:00] chastisement of my peace was upon on him
[14:02] and with his stripes William Brandon was
[14:04] healed oh if we can just read our name
[14:07] into scripture and really mean it it's
[14:10] that what does it read our name into it
[14:13] makes a uh uh receiving the pardoning
[14:17] for when we realize that he was wounded
[14:20] for our transgression he was bruised for
[14:22] our iniquity another thing we find out
[14:25] in Hebrews 911 that pardoning produces p
[14:29] Purity the worshipper having no more
[14:31] conscience of sin and has cleansed
[14:34] itself from Dead
[14:36] traditions when we really come under the
[14:39] blood we are cleansed from Dead
[14:42] traditions the scripture says so Hebrews
[14:44] n watch cleanse your conscience from
[14:47] Dead
[14:48] traditions then if you do that forget
[14:52] that you are a Baptist forget you are a
[14:54] Methodist forget you are a Pentecostal
[14:56] whatever you are and forget those Dead
[14:58] traditions and come to the blood come to
[15:02] that read your name and that and then do
[15:04] this then come to the communion table
[15:07] then come and find out who's right and
[15:08] wrong whether it's going to be a closed
[15:10] communion or not see if you can shut
[15:12] your brother out you can't do it you
[15:15] just can't do it there's something in
[15:17] you won't let you do it there's just
[15:19] something you see your name is read
[15:21] among those and you can't do it it
[15:24] purifies you it cleanses you remembering
[15:27] him as we kneel at the cross let him be
[15:29] a Catholic priest Presbyterian whatever
[15:32] he may be let that man come as he reads
[15:35] his name in there he was wounded for
[15:37] this priest's transgressions he is
[15:39] wounded for this Methodist this Baptist
[15:42] this Pentecostal what wounded for our
[15:45] transgressions my name your name
[15:48] whatever you are let us believe that not
[15:51] what the Creed says what the word says
[15:54] then let us kneel down on the cross
[15:56] together we're brothers oh yes the
[15:58] itions we cleanse oursel then from All
[16:01] Dead traditions they could be 40 State
[16:04] presb there could be 40 High priests
[16:06] there could be Cardinals and Bishops and
[16:08] popes and everything else H get up from
[16:11] there don't pollute yourself but you got
[16:13] your arms around your brother there's
[16:15] something real you've got pardoned under
[16:18] the same atonement that he's pardoned by
[16:21] your brother's it sticks closer than a
[16:24] brother it's something about it that
[16:26] draws you so close to God and when you
[16:28] draw close to God you draw close to each
[16:31] other how can you hate your brother who
[16:34] you do see or despise him and say you
[16:36] love God who you have not seen you
[16:39] become a liar and the truth's not in you
[16:41] but when we come to a place where the
[16:43] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[16:45] all sin then we are brothers then
[16:48] there's no difference in us our little
[16:50] old brands that we attacked on us don't
[16:52] mean a thing I remember there I passed
[16:55] the gate the other day and was referring
[16:56] to one of the brothers sitting here
[16:58] where used to heard cattle and coming
[16:59] through there the ranger would Mark
[17:01] those cattle as he went through in the
[17:02] spring Roundup and he watched he never
[17:05] they had all kinds of brands on him but
[17:07] he never noticed the brand he watched
[17:09] for the blood tag and it had to be a
[17:11] third bred Herford or it couldn't go on
[17:13] the repit forest for the Herford
[17:14] Association graay there it had to be a
[17:16] third Brad Herford I think that's the
[17:18] way it'll be at the end time he won't
[17:20] say are you a Methodist was you a
[17:22] Baptist that's a big question today what
[17:24] what are you are you a Methodist Baptist
[17:26] I said no or what are you uh president
[17:29] Luther Nazarene Pentecostal no what are
[17:32] you a Christian a Christian the blood
[17:35] tag see under the blood that means that
[17:38] every brother sister under that blood is
[17:40] my brother sister very deep sincerity
[17:44] there before Christ we the priest the
[17:47] preacher what more lay our hands upon
[17:50] our sacrifice and say we are guilty

[17:56] our place and we freely accept it oh

[19:01] you're not long ago in closing there was
[19:04] a man and a woman husband and wife was
[19:07] separating and they tried to make up
[19:10] they went to psychiatrist to find out if
[19:12] he could draw their minds together but
[19:14] he couldn't they went to everything that
[19:16] they could think of to try to stay
[19:18] together but they just fussed and
[19:20] contined they were divided and they just
[19:22] couldn't stand each other and couldn't
[19:23] stand in each other's presence and they
[19:25] go to fussing so they decided that they
[19:27] had divorce so they hir a lawyer to give
[19:30] him a divorce and he said well now
[19:32] before we do it said we'll sell the
[19:34] place and said you all better go down
[19:35] and divide the spars between you before
[19:38] you get the divorce and the place is
[19:41] sold so the husband and wife went
[19:43] together they went to the home and they
[19:45] went into the living room and she said
[19:48] I'm going to take this and he said I'm
[19:50] going to take this and they get pussed
[19:54] and they stewed and carried on with one
[19:56] another after a while they'd say well
[19:57] I'll give you this if you take this all
[20:00] right that went on a while then they
[20:02] went into the Parlor and a different
[20:04] places and into the kitchen and into the
[20:06] bedroom they divided their spars then
[20:08] finally they remembered there's some
[20:09] stuff in the Attic So they went up into
[20:12] the attic and they pulled out an old
[20:13] trunk and they begin to lay out
[20:15] different things say you can have this
[20:17] and you can have this and finally both
[20:20] of their eyes fell on a certain little
[20:22] object and they both grabbed
[20:25] for and they look at each other what was
[20:28] it a pair of little white
[20:31] shoes that belong to a baby that had
[20:36] deceased it was part of both of
[20:38] them there with their hands claps like
[20:41] that over this baby's shoe really who
[20:43] did it belong
[20:45] to whose was it it belonged to both of
[20:49] them they had things in common in a few
[20:53] minutes as one looked to the other tears
[20:55] begin to run down their cheeks what they
[20:57] could divide everything else but when
[20:59] they come to they had something in
[21:02] common the child and it was in
[21:05] heaven then the fuss was over in a few
[21:08] minutes they were in each other's arms
[21:10] the divorce was settled peace reign
[21:13] brother let me say this to you tonight
[21:15] we're not wanting you to join a
[21:17] church but I'm asking you this there's
[21:19] one thing that we have in common that's
[21:22] Jesus Christ he's in common with us we
[21:26] can't all be Baptists we can't all be
[21:28] method we can't all be Oneness or
[21:30] threeness or whatever it is we can't be
[21:32] that but there's one thing we have in
[21:33] common that's the pardoning offer of God
[21:37] his son Jesus
[21:39] Christ we have all things in him but
[21:42] that's the first thing for us to accept
[21:44] then we can get other things when we
[21:45] accept the pardon that God has offered
[21:48] us and that won't be through our
[21:49] educational system through our
[21:50] denominational system but it'll be
[21:52] through the blood of Jesus Christ we all
[21:54] can meet there of the Cross and be one
[21:56] and have things in common you believe
[21:58] that let us bow our heads just a moment
[22:01] while we
[22:10] pray with heads
[22:13] bowed surely Hearts bowed let's bow our
[22:17] hearts just a minute now with our heads
[22:19] saying Lord with my heart bowed now with
[22:22] all that of my
[22:24] tradition am I right or wrong let the
[22:27] Holy Spirit search through the heart now
[22:29] and if it's not just where it should be
[22:32] and you would like to be remembered in
[22:34] prayer in the closing that you know that
[22:37] we can all meet under one thing the
[22:40] blood the atonement and when we do then
[22:43] we're cleansed from all the things of
[22:45] the world and you'd like to be

[24:11] against those churches that they're all
[24:13] right but what I'm trying to say that
[24:16] that won't save you see it's got to be
[24:19] God's pardon uh uh pardoning Grace and
[24:22] it's only represented not through a
[24:25] church but through the blood of Jesus
[24:28] Christ that's your substitute when you
[24:30] can lay your hands upon him and say now
[24:33] I accept this substitute God be merciful
[24:37] to me and maybe there may be church
[24:39] members here that has join church with
[24:41] all good sincerity I believe that with
[24:44] all my heart you drawn with sincerity
[24:46] but you say brother random really my
[24:49] heart hasn't been cleansed from all
[24:51] these traditions and things I I believe
[24:53] if someone to speak against the very
[24:54] church that I if the Bible would even
[24:56] say tell me I we prove of the Bible that
[24:59] my church is wrong I I still couldn't
[25:01] accept it from my heart I couldn't do it
[25:03] but I want to pray for me would you
[25:05] raise your hand say pray I'll do it yes
[25:07] I sure will God Bless you that's good
[25:09] that's fine I I want to be able to
[25:13] accept everything that God said just the
[25:15] way he did in his Bible and I want the
[25:16] blood of Jesus Christ to come upon me
[25:19] and if the blood is applied the token
[25:21] see there is a token given of the blood
[25:23] and that's the Holy Spirit and when the
[25:25] Holy Spirit came down on the day of
[25:27] Pentecost you know what it did to the
[25:29] people and every time that it ever will
[25:32] come upon the people it'll do the very
[25:34] same thing Peter said for the promise
[25:37] isn't to you to your children to them
[25:39] it's far off even as many as the Lord
[25:42] Our God shall call this same promise if
[25:45] 10 cents is 10 cents here it's 10 cents
[25:48] out there it's wherever it's at it's 10
[25:49] cents if this is a diamond here it's a
[25:51] diamond there if this is a house sh it's
[25:53] a house there and if this is the holy
[25:56] spirit it fell on the day of Pentecost
[25:57] it's a same Holy Spirit today and you
[26:00] have never ex found that experience
[26:03] accept it now while we pray will you our
[26:06] heavenly
[26:07] father knowing that that the sun is
[26:11] swiftly going
[26:13] down time shall be no more one day the
[26:17] great Archangel will step out on the
[26:20] scene of time from out of Eternity and
[26:23] the trumpet of God shall sound and every
[26:25] man and woman will answer
[26:28] to
[26:30] what we know to be the truth the word of
[26:33] God there's got to be some standard that
[26:36] God has to have here on Earth that we're
[26:38] to be judged by and if we took the
[26:41] standard of our church our denomination
[26:44] how far would we miss it and which
[26:46] denomination would be right therefore
[26:49] we' be confused we wouldn't know what to
[26:51] do but there is a standard and that is
[26:54] your word and your word said except the
[26:57] man be born borned again he cannot even
[27:00] see the kingdom of God in other words he
[27:02] cannot understand it he must be accepted
[27:06] by faith and be born again and then he
[27:08] will understand it see is to understand
[27:12] and we pray God tonight that many of
[27:15] those hands going up tonight all over
[27:17] the building businessman of the city and
[27:21] women boys and girls I believe with
[27:24] sincerity they raise their hands now
[27:27] they could not raise their hands unless
[27:28] there was a conviction and the Holy
[27:31] Spirit by them has proved to them that
[27:35] they are wrong and brought conviction
[27:37] that they want to be right and they
[27:39] raised up their hands to you the great
[27:42] Creator knowing that they have to meet
[27:45] you someday and they were sincere I
[27:48] believe Lord and I'm interceding for
[27:50] each one I trust tonight Lord as I pray
[27:54] that not one hand that went up will ever
[27:57] be able to have rest until the Holy
[28:00] Spirit has filled their life granted
[28:03] Lord I claim them for the trophies of
[28:06] Jesus Christ do it Lord I pray Save The
[28:11] Lost fill those who have accepted Christ
[28:14] with the Holy Ghost pour it out upon
[28:16] their souls father get Glory unto
[28:19] thyself Jesus you have said to us no man
[28:23] can come to me except my father draws
[28:25] him first and Faith cometh by hearing
[28:28] and hearing of the word of God and now
[28:32] word of God being preached faith comes
[28:35] by hearing and they have been drawn
[28:38] because the Bible said those who he
[28:41] forne he
[28:43] predestinated and those who he
[28:44] predestinated he called and those who he
[28:47] called he gave eternal life and now back
[28:51] in the beginning before the world you
[28:54] put their names upon the Lamb's Book of
[28:57] Life and tonight the Holy Spirit has
[29:01] called and they rais their hands now
[29:03] Lord give them eternal life I asked it
[29:07] for the glory of God that the holy
[29:10] spirit will come down in their hearts
[29:12] and circumcise them from all dead works
[29:15] and traditions and give them free
[29:17] pardoning and fill them with his
[29:20] presence that they might go forth from
[29:22] this day in the hour of Darkness like it
[29:25] was in the days of Sodom when painted
[29:29] faed women
[29:31] immorality shook the Nations oh Lord God
[29:35] May men and women go forth as burning
[29:38] blazes May the Holy Spirit literally
[29:42] send Holy Fire upon them Lord until
[29:45] they'll be so filled with God's goodness
[29:48] and and that they'll go forth to call
[29:50] every sinner that they come in contact
[29:52] to the Cross Grant it Lord where they
[29:55] too can fall and find pardoning
[29:58] do that to the Methodist Baptist
[30:00] Presbyterian Pentecostals and all Lord
[30:03] granted they are yours now I commit them
[30:05] into your hands that you will grant this
[30:08] to them in Jesus Christ's name
[30:14] amen you Lov him
