[45:00] Amen. And uh we will also greet uh Good
[45:03] to see you, AJ. We'll greet our brother
[45:05] Samuel and uh from uh Pennsylvania.
[45:13] He came, he was with us on Wednesday
[45:14] night. He just fell right into the
[45:16] crowd. So uh never thought about
[45:19] greeting him, but brother Samuel, you
[45:20] are welcome. That's brother Elijah,
[45:23] younger brother. And uh that was his uh
[45:27] Aaron for many years. Samuel was Aaron
[45:30] to Elijah. you know that I mean that
[45:33] Moses couldn't speak. So God gave him an
[45:36] Aaron to be able to speak for him. So
[45:39] Samuel was Elijah Aaron uh for many
[45:43] years there as a deacon in the church
[45:46] and then came over to the states to
[45:48] study but he's there in Pennsylvania
[45:51] with brother in the church and uh uh
[45:55] ministering for them there too. So he
[45:57] was uh with brother Flint in Alaska and
[46:01] and decided to come down here just to
[46:04] visit with us and and uh so it's good to
[46:06] have you Samuel
[46:09] and uh uh hopefully maybe on Wednesday
[46:12] we will have him to testify to us u
[46:15] after the prayer meeting. We'll have a
[46:17] prayer meeting on Wednesday night
[46:19] against the service of Friday evening.
[46:22] So, uh uh
[46:26] uh
[46:29] we'll have a Wednesday night prayer
[46:30] meeting and then uh Friday evening,
[46:33] Friday night, uh service will be uh from
[46:36] 8:00 p.m. And uh uh from 8:00 p.m. we
[46:41] will
[46:42] we will uh
[46:54] nice service
[46:58] and uh
[47:00] uh
[47:02] so let's uh
[47:05] let's pray and uh trust that the Lord
[47:08] will meet with us here uh uh this this
[47:11] assembly by the grace of God uh uh will
[47:15] be holding on uh 30 years uh uh by next
[47:20] week. So uh the Lord has uh he has
[47:25] helped us over the years.
[47:28] I think uh uh the church went couple of
[47:32] years before we came in and started
[47:34] working with the brothers. So uh we we
[47:38] want to appreciate the Lord for what was
[47:40] done here and what uh what we are doing
[47:44] and what we continue to be done even at
[47:46] a time when uh our
[47:50] our our
[47:52] time is over if Jesus tried. Praise the
[47:56] Lord.
[47:57] So uh we have uh one desire in our heart
[48:02] is that the Lord will give us a
[48:04] privilege to be able to leave a memorial
[48:06] and uh something that uh uh
[48:12] we can look back to and and says that
[48:15] the Lord definitely he was with us.
[48:18] Praise the Lord. We are looking forward
[48:20] to that. We are looking forward to that.
[48:23] So, uh, uh, for those that will be able
[48:26] to make it, uh, if you can be able to
[48:29] grab a little bit of a sleep or nap
[48:31] before you come, that would be good. We
[48:33] just want to spend some time in, uh, uh,
[48:37] praise and also uh, prayer and uh, just
[48:41] just giving thanks that the Lord has
[48:43] been good for us. That is this coming
[48:46] Friday, the 18 at 8:00 p.m. service will
[48:50] begin for us this morning. brother
[48:52] Wesley and Sister Carrot uh and not able
[48:55] to be with us because Sister Carrot is
[48:57] not feeling well and she was doing a
[49:00] little better but uh uh uh the same with
[49:03] uh Sister Elizabeth you know uh uh the
[49:07] devil always trying to put sin in our
[49:11] meal but uh we will we will praise the
[49:14] Lord anyhow. But we just want to
[49:17] remember them in prayer that the Lord
[49:18] will continue to be with them. Praise
[49:21] the Lord. And uh uh
[49:26] we want to thank the Lord for the
[49:28] service on Wednesday. Praise the Lord. I
[49:30] believe that was a wonderful service.
[49:32] Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; That was a really wonderful service. I
[49:34] don't know what's going on this year,
[49:36] but I just I just I'm just enjoying it.
[49:39] you know, we have brother Delhi and he
[49:41] was supposed to stay till the weekend
[49:44] and then uh brother asks that uh he come
[49:48] over to uh Tucson to preach. So we had
[49:52] to let him go and also we had brother
[49:56] Jabz and Jabz was supposed to stay and
[49:58] preach for us today and uh brother Jack
[50:01] Dove wanted him over in Florida so we
[50:04] had to let him go. I was thinking in my
[50:06] mind, I said, "Well, maybe God is just
[50:09] uh trying to bless our Wednesday
[50:11] service." Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; And don't make us only a a Sunday
[50:15] Christian. So, if the preachers just
[50:17] come on Wednesday night, we will receive
[50:19] them. We hardly don't have people coming
[50:21] through our place. So, if they only
[50:23] coming for Wednesday night, we will say,
[50:25] "Thank you, Jesus." Amen. So, brother
[50:28] Jabius is out uh in Florida there today

[50:47] have a prayer meeting on Wednesday
[50:48] night. So, uh uh we will have a prayer
[50:51] meeting on Wednesday night. Praise the
[50:54] Lord. Amen. I know it's not uh it's not
[50:58] culture for us to have service on
[51:00] Wednesday and service on Friday but
[51:02] Friday service is a birthday service
[51:05] okay is a special at 30 years old I mean
[51:08] you can go for the night dinner there

[51:20] up lead the prayer and then uh we will

[59:55] Praise the Lord.
[59:57] Daniel chapter 9.
[1:00:09] Let's go to Daniel chapter 9.
[1:00:16] We spoke from Daniel chapter 9 couple of
[1:00:19] weeks ago. for I say a month ago and we
[1:00:23] spoke literally from this uh very same
[1:00:26] place we're going to read from this
[1:00:28] morning Daniel chapter 9 let's read from
[1:00:30] verse 20
[1:00:39] praise the Lord
[1:00:41] Daniel chapter 9 let's read from verse
[1:00:44] 20
[1:00:47] and while I was speaking and praying
[1:00:52] and confessing my sin and the and the
[1:00:54] sin of my people
[1:00:58] Israel and presenting my supplication
[1:01:01] before the Lord my God for the holy
[1:01:04] mountains of my God.
[1:01:07] Yeah. While I was speaking in prayer,
[1:01:12] even the man down in the man Gabriel
[1:01:14] whom I have seen in the vision at the
[1:01:17] beginning being caused to fly swiftly
[1:01:20] touch me about the time of the evening
[1:01:24] oblation. Amen. The evening sacrifice,
[1:01:27] the evening oblation, the evening
[1:01:29] service. and uh
[1:01:32] and he informed me and he talked with me
[1:01:35] and said, "Oh Daniel,
[1:01:38] I am now comfort to give thee skills and
[1:01:41] understanding
[1:01:43] at the beginning of thy supplication.
[1:01:48] The commandment came forth and and I am
[1:01:52] come to show thee, for thou art greatly
[1:01:56] beloved." Amen. Do you feel greatly
[1:02:00] beloved this morning?
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. If you don't feel
[1:02:05] that, I pray that the Lord will be able
[1:02:07] to do something special for you that
[1:02:09] you'll be able to feel his love. Amen.
[1:02:13] Therefore,
[1:02:14] understand the matter and consider the
[1:02:17] vision.
[1:02:19] 70 weeks are determined upon that
[1:02:22] people. Amen. So this 70 weeks are not
[1:02:27] 70 weeks. It's 70 years week. We
[1:02:32] explained that to you. They there are 70
[1:02:35] weeks of months, 70 weeks of years. So
[1:02:39] this is 70 weeks of years. 70 weeks are
[1:02:42] determined upon that people and upon
[1:02:44] that holy city to finish the
[1:02:46] transgression and to make an end of sin
[1:02:50] and to make rec uh reconciliation for
[1:02:53] the iniquity and to bring in everlasting
[1:02:57] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[1:03:00] and prophecy and to anoint the most
[1:03:03] holy.
[1:03:06] Know therefore and understand that from
[1:03:10] the going forth of the commandment, pay
[1:03:12] attention today, that's where we will
[1:03:14] take our inspiration from this morning.
[1:03:16] From the going forth of the commandment
[1:03:18] to restore and to build Jerusalem.
[1:03:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:25] We started in the time of uh uh King
[1:03:28] Cyprus prophesied by Isaiah and uh uh
[1:03:33] from the glory for the commandment to
[1:03:35] restore and to build Jerusalem onto
[1:03:38] Messiah the prince.
[1:03:41] Amen.
[1:03:43] Shall be 70 weeks 70 weeks of years and
[1:03:49] three schools and two weeks of years. if
[1:03:54] uh just just to be able to to give some
[1:03:57] context to it. I'm not talking on 70
[1:04:00] weeks this morning. The street shall be
[1:04:03] built again and the walls even in
[1:04:08] troubles time.
[1:04:10] Amen. I want to speak on building in
[1:04:14] troubles time. Building in troublesome
[1:04:17] time.
[1:04:19] That's what I want to speak on this
[1:04:20] morning. The Lord bless you. You may
[1:04:22] have your seat as we ask blessing upon
[1:04:25] the word. We want to talk on building in
[1:04:29] troublesome time.
[1:04:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:34] Building in troublesome time.
[1:04:39] Now the the the the the book of Daniel
[1:04:43] uh uh we we been taught by by the God's
[1:04:48] prophet that the book of Daniel
[1:04:51] uh uh actually speaks of the beginning
[1:04:54] of the gentile dispensation. So the book
[1:04:57] of Daniel holds a lot of prophecy for
[1:05:01] for the gentile age for our age and and
[1:05:05] and and some of the things that uh that
[1:05:07] are seen in the book of Daniel is uh
[1:05:11] spiritual warfare. The book of Daniel
[1:05:14] exposes
[1:05:16] how the gentile people
[1:05:19] will come into believing Jesus honor a
[1:05:22] lot of spiritual warfare
[1:05:26] coming down from our ancestors with all
[1:05:29] the ungodly worship and sacrifice
[1:05:33] and and and you will see that and and
[1:05:35] and in the book of Da there are some
[1:05:38] things that are that are revealed that
[1:05:40] you will not find anywhere. You never
[1:05:42] find the Asian of day used in any any
[1:05:45] any book of the Bible. It's only unto
[1:05:48] Daniel the Asian of day was revealed
[1:05:52] which of course is another attribute of
[1:05:54] God. It's another title of God, another
[1:05:57] attribute of God. And in the book of
[1:05:59] Daniel, you see where the Bible talk
[1:06:01] about the prince of Persia,
[1:06:05] the spirits that rule nations,
[1:06:08] the spirit that govern people, spirit
[1:06:11] that rules city. Even our city broken
[1:06:14] part is ruled by the spirit.
[1:06:18] Praise the Lord. And and and you know
[1:06:21] and and places are identified like that,
[1:06:24] you know. Uh uh uh so in in in the Bible
[1:06:28] talk after the prince of Pesha comes the
[1:06:31] prince of Greeks you know uh so Daniel
[1:06:35] uh uh uh and and just like we said you
[1:06:38] know uh uh you know that in Daniel he's
[1:06:40] praying he reading Jeremiah prophecy and
[1:06:44] he's seeing that is is is you know this
[1:06:46] this is the time that they in Babylon
[1:06:48] he's going back to Jeremiah prophecy and
[1:06:51] he's trying to pray it and understand
[1:06:53] the time you know how many years left
[1:06:56] are we in the 70 years. How many more
[1:06:58] years? You know, he's praying, oh God,
[1:07:00] forgive our sin. Oh God, help reveal
[1:07:02] this thing. and and and uh he's praying
[1:07:05] there and we see here that uh that uh uh
[1:07:11] Gabriel will will will later on reveal
[1:07:15] to Daniel that uh uh uh from the day he
[1:07:19] started praying his prayers were lifted
[1:07:22] up but there were spirits that were
[1:07:24] waring against his prayers. Amen. He
[1:07:27] says h the prince of Persia, the city
[1:07:30] you are living in, you know, the the the
[1:07:32] the demon power, the prince of that
[1:07:35] city, a prince is uh is uh is is a place
[1:07:39] of authority. It's a commanding place of
[1:07:42] authority. This man is a prince. Okay.
[1:07:45] So is is a place it's a position of
[1:07:48] authority. Now, so uh uh uh and he and
[1:07:52] and and we learned that that was that
[1:07:54] was about 21 days. I believe that is the
[1:07:58] place where churches take 21 day fast,
[1:08:00] you know. Uh uh uh because Daniel was
[1:08:03] praying and fasting. Uh but what was
[1:08:05] happening is that Daniel was not praying
[1:08:07] and fasting for 21 days. But Daniel was
[1:08:10] war against 21 days. And and Gabriel
[1:08:14] will reveal that to to Daniel that 21
[1:08:16] days these powers were fighting against
[1:08:18] you. And whether you believe it or not,
[1:08:20] you and myself are dealing with the same
[1:08:22] thing. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. If
[1:08:25] it is not real to you yet, you need to
[1:08:27] check your birth. Praise the Lord. If
[1:08:29] you are born again and uh uh that you
[1:08:31] know that uh serving the Lord is not a
[1:08:34] picnic. Praise the Lord. Serving the
[1:08:36] Lord is a warfare and and every day
[1:08:38] there are things that are waring against
[1:08:40] our life. Praise the Lord. Amen. So you
[1:08:43] see all of those things and uh you know
[1:08:46] and and and lot of the things uh you
[1:08:48] know lot of history even in the time
[1:08:51] that we are living in the the
[1:08:53] restoration we see the abomination that
[1:08:56] make a desolation is prophesied in the
[1:08:58] book of Daniel. you will realize that uh
[1:09:01] uh uh uh what what scholars call the
[1:09:04] silent years. You know, they think that
[1:09:06] between Malachi and and and Matthew, the
[1:09:09] Bible never said anything about it. The
[1:09:12] Bible said what was happening because
[1:09:14] it's right here in the book of Daniel
[1:09:17] from the time of the commandment to Miah
[1:09:19] the prince. So it covered that period of
[1:09:22] time.
[1:09:24] So there is no time in history where the
[1:09:26] Bible is silenced.
[1:09:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is just no time in history
[1:09:34] where the Bible is silenced. It cover
[1:09:38] every time because that's God's word.
[1:09:41] Are we together?
[1:09:43] And that's the reason why the book of
[1:09:45] Daniel is such a is such a a powerful
[1:09:49] book.
[1:09:50] It's a wonderful book uh uh for the
[1:09:52] gentile church
[1:09:54] because that's where God started giving
[1:09:57] Daniel visions and prophecy concerning
[1:10:00] the gentile dispensation.
[1:10:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which dispensation we are stay in.
[1:10:09] So uh uh
[1:10:12] but like I said uh we are not uh going
[1:10:15] you know uh into into u some of those
[1:10:19] things but when we spoke on uh Messiah
[1:10:22] the prince like I said Daniel speaks
[1:10:25] about the prince of Pesia the prince of
[1:10:27] Greece but then he also he also reveal
[1:10:38] against us, we also have one that is
[1:10:42] fighting for us. Are we together?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; So he says Messiah the prince, that's
[1:10:50] another attribute. That's another title
[1:10:52] that God reveal himself as the one that
[1:10:55] defend his people.
[1:10:59] Praise the Lord. And it even run down to
[1:11:02] the New Testament that tied to the
[1:11:05] prince. Paul in the book of Ephesians we
[1:11:07] say the prince of the power of of the
[1:11:10] air. The spirit that walketh in the
[1:11:13] children of disobedience.
[1:11:16] The spirit that workketh in the children
[1:11:18] of disobedience have a prince.
[1:11:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. On the on the date of uh
[1:11:28] Pentecost, Peter says, "You have killed
[1:11:30] the prince of life." He called Jesus the
[1:11:33] prince of life.
[1:11:36] He's our prince. He's our defense.
[1:11:41] So God in the book of Daniel was
[1:11:43] revealing that just like how they are
[1:11:46] they are spirits that are waring. You
[1:11:48] remember Jesus there in the in in
[1:11:51] Gethsemane. He says I can call for
[1:11:53] legions of angels. He was not bragging.
[1:11:57] Amen. No, he could call for it because
[1:12:01] he was he was the the commanding host of
[1:12:04] the the heavenly body. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I could call for it,
[1:12:12] but I'm not going to put my will into
[1:12:14] this. Not my will, but let his will be
[1:12:16] done."
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, the book of Daniel
[1:12:20] also revealed that that just like how we
[1:12:23] we uh uh let let me show you something.
[1:12:26] Uh uh you see there over in uh uh
[1:12:32] over there in in uh in the book of
[1:12:34] Daniel it speaks about how uh uh uh uh
[1:12:38] Gabriel says, you know, wrestled against
[1:12:42] the prince of Pesha and then and and
[1:12:45] then Michael the archangel came and you
[1:12:48] know and and and and fought with me.
[1:12:52] Praise the Lord. These are not just uh
[1:12:55] scary movies. They are reality.
[1:12:59] Because Jude in the New Testament would
[1:13:01] tell us how uh uh uh uh that inj
[1:13:07] Moses.
[1:13:12] Praise the Lord. You know, God told
[1:13:14] Moses or Moses told the people he was
[1:13:17] going up on the mountain and he would
[1:13:20] not he would not come back.
[1:13:22] you know, he gave his farewell message
[1:13:23] and, you know, he told the people that
[1:13:25] he will be gone. This is, you
[1:13:31] look at the promised land. Praise the
[1:13:33] Lord. You know, God is so good. Very so
[1:13:37] good. Amen. He had to pick up the body
[1:13:41] of Moses by an angel because he knew
[1:13:45] Israel will have gone for his body and
[1:13:48] idolized his body.
[1:13:51] Praise the Lord. That's just men. Men
[1:13:54] idolize their hero.
[1:13:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; The word LeBron James just the word that
[1:14:02] this other person kept the word every
[1:14:04] men idolize their hero.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I hope we could idolize our hero Jesus
[1:14:09] Christ like that.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because he's not a dead
[1:14:12] hero. He's a living hero.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So God had to pick up the body of Moses.
[1:14:17] I believe the people went down the
[1:14:19] mountain. the check. I believe that. I
[1:14:22] believe it because it's the thing that
[1:14:24] is common about men.
[1:14:27] You go down the road, you see the you
[1:14:29] see uh uh people pull crosses down the
[1:14:32] road because their loved one was killed
[1:14:34] at this place. They put it there for a
[1:14:36] memorial.
[1:14:38] Praise the Lord. We we have flaws and
[1:14:41] tsunami and then after h earthquake and
[1:14:44] all of those things after those things
[1:14:46] people will go back into the rubbage and
[1:14:48] they try to look for the the the uh the
[1:14:51] lifeless body of their loved one. That
[1:14:53] is the human thing to do.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; So if Moses went up that mountain
[1:15:00] and he told the people he were not
[1:15:01] coming back and after 30 days after a
[1:15:04] month they didn't see him. I'm very well
[1:15:06] sure that he sent men up there. let's go
[1:15:09] and find him so we can bury him. But
[1:15:12] they never found a body.
[1:15:15] They never found a body because angels
[1:15:18] took his body.
[1:15:22] And I believe that. I believe that in my
[1:15:24] heart because God never wanted his
[1:15:27] prophet to be idolized.
[1:15:34] Are we together?
[1:15:36] So Jude will reveal to us that uh the
[1:15:39] that the that that the angel Micah
[1:15:41] fought over
[1:15:44] the devil for the body of Moses. It's in
[1:15:48] the book of Jude.
[1:15:50] Praise the Lord. So you see the uh uh uh
[1:15:53] the the same the same angel that came
[1:15:56] fighting here for Dirh
[1:16:00] backing up Gabriel. We see him also on
[1:16:02] the other side. You know uh Jude is
[1:16:04] testifying that this is that is not the
[1:16:07] first time it have ever happened. This
[1:16:09] is an arch angel that is always sent on
[1:16:12] the defense of God's people.
[1:16:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:17] So no matter what we are going through,
[1:16:19] if we would just only start learning to
[1:16:22] be conscious
[1:16:28] when God says everything work together
[1:16:31] for them that's together work good
[1:16:34] together for for to them that love the
[1:16:36] Lord. He knows why he said it
[1:16:40] because he's not leaving the fight to
[1:16:42] you alone.
[1:16:44] He's in the fight. He's a man of war.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; He likes to fight
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; because he knows when he fights, he
[1:16:53] wins.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; He's a man of war.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; He love to fight because he knows when
[1:17:00] he fights, he wins.
[1:17:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, may God just help us. May God help
[1:17:11] us. Amen. listening here the uh uh uh
[1:17:15] from from adoption uh message here
[1:17:19] adoption second message you just
[1:17:21] listening and see what he says here and
[1:17:23] remember the only way that Israel ever
[1:17:26] lost a man the only way that Israel ever
[1:17:30] lost a man or ever lost a battle the
[1:17:33] only way we will ever feel defeated or
[1:17:36] we will ever lost a battle
[1:17:39] is when sin got in the camp.
[1:17:44] Praise the Lord. That is the only way we
[1:17:46] could ever lost a victory
[1:17:50] is for sin to get in the camp. Something
[1:17:53] wrong somewhere when Aam stole the Welch
[1:17:57] and that Babylonian garment. Sin was sin
[1:18:00] was in the camp and the battle went
[1:18:03] wrong.
[1:18:05] Are we together? And the battle went
[1:18:08] wrong. Hallelujah. Now you see the thing
[1:18:12] here is that uh uh uh uh sin being in
[1:18:17] the camp.
[1:18:19] Let's look at it this way. Let's let's
[1:18:21] identify it this way or let's define it
[1:18:24] this way. It is the way word uh uh you
[1:18:27] know uh uh sin being in the camp is is
[1:18:32] unbelief the the the the ability of
[1:18:37] God's people h
[1:18:40] depending on him. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:18:45] Believing him for whatever they are
[1:18:47] dealing with. Counting that God is more
[1:18:50] than able. Praise the Lord. When we come
[1:18:53] short of that and we start to find our
[1:18:58] own way to our problem that's sin in the
[1:19:01] camp. Now you see when we read this the
[1:19:05] this uh this kind of a code what comes
[1:19:08] to people mind sin in the candy they
[1:19:10] start to think about lying stealing
[1:19:12] adultery and all of that those are the
[1:19:14] attribute of sin those are the attribute
[1:19:17] of sin but what what he's dealing with
[1:19:20] here is unbelief
[1:19:25] amen when people have not rise to the
[1:19:29] place where they can be able to trust
[1:19:33] God for what they are dealing with.
[1:19:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:39] Amen.
[1:19:41] Oh uh uh uh
[1:19:46] uh Paul said it like this in Hebrew
[1:19:50] chapter 19. He said it in a way that uh
[1:19:54] uh uh
[1:19:56] uh
[1:19:59] counting God able.
[1:20:01] Amen. You are counting that God is able.
[1:20:07] Praise the Lord. And then when we get
[1:20:09] short of that, accounting that God was
[1:20:13] able to raise him up. Talking about God
[1:20:15] was able to raise Isaac up. He was not
[1:20:18] afraid. He was believing. He was
[1:20:20] counting that God was able. Praise the
[1:20:23] Lord. If he said I should kill him, he's
[1:20:26] able to raise him up again.
[1:20:29] Are we together? So if we are not
[1:20:31] counting, if we are not believing that
[1:20:34] God is able to deal with our situation,
[1:20:38] that's unbelief.
[1:20:40] Amen. That's unbelief. Then what happens
[1:20:44] now? It leads you to the attributes. It
[1:20:47] produce fear. It produce worry. It
[1:20:51] produce lying. It produce stealing.
[1:20:55] Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; It produce adultery.
[1:20:59] Why? Because you are not counting that
[1:21:02] God is able.
[1:21:07] Are we together?
[1:21:11] So, uh that's the only time I mean that
[1:21:14] is the only time things will go wrong
[1:21:17] when we when we when we when we when we
[1:21:20] drop into a channel of fear. How am I
[1:21:23] going to get out of this? How is this
[1:21:24] going to happen?
[1:21:32] You give me this church tonight, this
[1:21:36] group of people perfectly in the promise
[1:21:39] of God with the Holy Ghost, walking in
[1:21:42] the spirit. I challenge any disease of
[1:21:45] affliction or any affliction or anything
[1:21:49] that there is any Joe Lewis there is in
[1:21:52] the country with all of his uh uh uh
[1:21:58] invitality and all the unbelief that
[1:22:01] there is to bring any sickness or
[1:22:04] affliction in the door.
[1:22:08] He says, "I challenge, give me a church,
[1:22:11] this church tonight, standing in the
[1:22:13] promise, standing right in the word."
[1:22:17] Amen. Standing on on the basis of God's
[1:22:20] word.
[1:22:23] I challenge anything.
[1:22:27] Are we together?
[1:22:29] But you see uh uh uh sometimes
[1:22:35] where some of our
[1:22:43] Okay.
[1:22:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:52] Let's drop down. Let's look at uh uh uh
[1:22:55] uh second coming. Let's let's just read
[1:22:57] something here in second coming. I have
[1:22:58] I have this thing uh wrongly placed
[1:23:01] here. So that's what I'm looking for it.
[1:23:03] It says look look here. We read this and
[1:23:05] and now you can have an intellectual
[1:23:08] faith
[1:23:09] by hearing the word
[1:23:12] and perceiving it in your mind. You are
[1:23:15] hearing the word, you are thinking about
[1:23:17] it and accepting it upon those basis
[1:23:22] which is an intellectual faith. Praise
[1:23:26] the Lord. Which mean
[1:23:29] all you do about the word you just
[1:23:31] reason.
[1:23:34] It's not a revelation. It does not
[1:23:36] strike you. Let me tell you the
[1:23:39] difference between intellectual faith
[1:23:41] and divine faith. Divine faith will
[1:23:44] affect your life.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; It will affect your life. It will affect
[1:23:49] your manner of living.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; It will bring your body in obedience to
[1:23:55] God's word. You cannot have divine faith
[1:23:58] believing God for something and living
[1:24:00] contrary to God's word. It does not
[1:24:02] work. That's an intellectual faith. You
[1:24:05] know how to quote the scripture. You
[1:24:07] know how to explain it, but it's not
[1:24:09] real down here
[1:24:12] because what you know cannot affect your
[1:24:14] life. What you know cannot empower you.
[1:24:21] Are we together? Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; So it is just wishes, intellectual
[1:24:30] faith. But the faith that Jesus was
[1:24:33] speaking about in St. John 5:24, he that
[1:24:36] heareth my word and believe on him that
[1:24:38] sent me has everlasting life. That
[1:24:41] doesn't comes from intellectual faith.
[1:24:43] That comes from bornagain experience.
[1:24:48] It comes from the new birth.
[1:24:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:57] So this morning we we we want to talk on
[1:25:01] uh building in in in uh troubles time in
[1:25:05] troublesome time. Uh we have we have
[1:25:09] some time we will uh be able to take
[1:25:11] this in couple of services because there
[1:25:14] was some things I wanted to get get
[1:25:16] through but uh I couldn't. So uh uh this
[1:25:20] this this uh uh troubles time or means
[1:25:24] uh uh uh uh a time full of trouble,
[1:25:28] disturbance and tumor.
[1:25:30] And you think about it, you think about
[1:25:33] it. Think about it this way. Let me
[1:25:36] create this picture in your mind. The
[1:25:38] Bible says in the beginning, Genesis
[1:25:41] chapter 1, in the beginning God made the
[1:25:43] heaven and the earth. And right there at
[1:25:46] Genesis 2, then the Bible says the earth
[1:25:48] was with our form.
[1:25:51] So right right from the time where God
[1:25:55] will will build an Eden,
[1:25:57] Eden will be God's first palace.
[1:26:01] He had to build it in troublesome time
[1:26:04] because there was darkness all over.
[1:26:08] The land was filled with water. Praise
[1:26:10] the Lord.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So all of these things
[1:26:15] were happening and in the midst of that
[1:26:17] God is going to bring an Eden. So what
[1:26:20] I'm trying to say here is that if you
[1:26:22] look through the scripture is a biblical
[1:26:25] principle. God has always built some of
[1:26:28] the beautiful things in the time of
[1:26:31] trouble.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll give you example. Solomon
[1:26:42] built his temple in a time where there
[1:26:45] was no war, no fighting, nothing.
[1:26:50] But yet he could not keep the glory of
[1:26:52] that temple. He turned it over to to
[1:26:55] idols
[1:26:58] because the women he married ruined his
[1:27:00] heart. He worshiped every god under the
[1:27:03] sun.
[1:27:05] Like I said before, he was trying to
[1:27:07] protect the thing that was given freely
[1:27:09] to him. what God gave him freely. He did
[1:27:12] not fight for it
[1:27:14] trying to protect it. He married women
[1:27:18] from every nation under heaven.
[1:27:27] But some of the beautiful things some of
[1:27:29] the beautiful things that God has built
[1:27:35] wonderful lives.
[1:27:38] Even look at Ezra.
[1:27:41] It's a desert land.
[1:27:45] They have one of uh one of the the the
[1:27:48] the best irrigation system
[1:27:51] that give them water all through the
[1:27:53] year
[1:27:56] because the Bible says the mountain will
[1:27:59] bloom with rose
[1:28:01] and God has to give it to them. But but
[1:28:04] I I mean the nation was built
[1:28:08] in troublesome time.
[1:28:11] Praise the Lord. Men that came up with
[1:28:14] with with with inspiration and and and
[1:28:17] you know that that that rose to place of
[1:28:20] influence,
[1:28:21] they were built in troublesome time.
[1:28:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:29] Sometimes some families
[1:28:32] are built in troublesome time.
[1:28:36] go through wreck in their in their life,
[1:28:39] loss of children and uh uh I mean uh uh
[1:28:43] fusses and and and what have you think
[1:28:45] about it
[1:28:47] but yet if they can if they can throw
[1:28:49] themselves as materials in God's hands
[1:28:53] he can build them back.
[1:28:56] Praise the Lord. I'm just I'm just
[1:28:58] wetting your appetite.
[1:29:01] I have a list of them that we'll go
[1:29:02] through as we go through this subject.
[1:29:07] But there is that it's just it's just
[1:29:09] something something of God. See the time
[1:29:12] that the the the the ark was built. The
[1:29:15] Bible says when man imagination was evil
[1:29:20] when their imagination was evil when the
[1:29:23] spirit of God will no longer strive with
[1:29:26] men.
[1:29:29] when man has become so disobedient and
[1:29:32] and and and and and uh and and they were
[1:29:34] just living and how contrary to God's
[1:29:37] word yet in that time that was a
[1:29:39] troublesome time.
[1:29:42] God will take a farmer
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; a man that have no skill of building
[1:29:50] and he will build an ark that withstands
[1:29:53] God's judgment.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh my my my my man. I
[1:30:01] love the Lord. It's a paradox.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a paradox.
[1:30:07] You will never see that right now. H
[1:30:10] Russia and Ukraine are in war. You will
[1:30:13] never see men building when when Mises
[1:30:16] are flying.
[1:30:18] But that's the time that God's built
[1:30:21] when there is trouble. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:24] When Mesus are flying and everything,
[1:30:27] the Bible says Neimas and his men they
[1:30:30] had one break in their hands and they
[1:30:32] had a swore in another hand to build the
[1:30:34] wall of the temple
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; because God build in troublesome time.
[1:30:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:45] Some of our problem is that we have
[1:30:47] never understand God's principle.
[1:30:50] We never understand. We never even
[1:30:52] understand what he's doing with our
[1:30:54] lives.
[1:30:55] We just think that we are the driver of
[1:30:58] our life. We can make our own decision.
[1:30:59] We can choose to do whatever we want to.
[1:31:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:07] My question for you is that if you give
[1:31:09] me the date when you will leave this
[1:31:11] word, I will believe you.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; If you think you can do whatever you can
[1:31:15] do, tell me when are you leaving?
[1:31:20] because you never choose the day that
[1:31:21] you came to this earth.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; So
[1:31:31] the power of your life is now in your
[1:31:33] hands. If you can tell me, you can tell
[1:31:36] me your birthday because they told you
[1:31:38] it.
[1:31:39] But if you can tell me your death date,
[1:31:45] then I would believe that you have the
[1:31:47] control
[1:31:49] of your life.
[1:31:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:02] Oh, what a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[1:32:06] What a wonderful Jesus
[1:32:08] we serve.
[1:32:14] Oh, I pray that that uh
[1:32:18] the Lord will speak to you
[1:32:21] and uh and make you to to see some of
[1:32:24] these things. You know, we were talking
[1:32:26] few uh services ago. We talked about
[1:32:30] Jesus
[1:32:31] promise, I will build the I will build
[1:32:33] my church.
[1:32:38] First I mean, you'll see why I was
[1:32:39] playing that song in the car, the tri
[1:32:41] the church triumphing
[1:32:43] because that's where I was gearing to.
[1:32:45] Jesus said, "I will build my church uh
[1:32:48] uh uh but and the gates of hell would
[1:32:50] not prevail against it." But you see
[1:32:52] that uh uh uh but the building the
[1:32:55] building of this church has never has
[1:32:57] never come so easy.
[1:33:00] See what the church went through.
[1:33:03] The forerunner
[1:33:07] the forerunner head landed on a plate.
[1:33:09] John the Baptist
[1:33:12] that forerunned the building of the
[1:33:14] church. The man that said the kingdom of
[1:33:16] God is at hand. His hair landed on a
[1:33:19] plate.
[1:33:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:28] I believe in a natural mind Jesus is
[1:33:30] saying uh I will build my church in the
[1:33:33] gates of hell when I prevail against
[1:33:35] said
[1:33:37] him one of the disciples who has stand
[1:33:39] and says Lord you see the gifts of hell.
[1:33:41] Yet John the Baptist has killed the very
[1:33:43] man that introduced you. His head is in
[1:33:47] a plate and you say the gates of hell
[1:33:50] will not prevail against it. What are
[1:33:51] you talking about? Can you stand these
[1:33:54] people? Don't you know we are on a the
[1:33:56] Roman power and we have a sahhindrance
[1:33:59] council that has that has compromised
[1:34:01] their right
[1:34:05] to Rome. What do you mean by the gates
[1:34:08] of hell? But Jesus was not shaken. He
[1:34:11] was not mistaken when he said, "I will
[1:34:14] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:34:18] will not prevail against it." He never
[1:34:20] said it would not come against it, but
[1:34:21] he said it will not prevail against it.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I believe that a
[1:34:28] piece of break of that church is in this
[1:34:31] building this morning.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. That's what I
[1:34:36] believe. No matter what we go through,
[1:34:38] Amen.
[1:34:39] We have gone from three person in church
[1:34:41] to 10 person in church to 20 person in
[1:34:44] church. We came close to 100 person in
[1:34:47] church. No matter what we go through,
[1:34:56] are we together? Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; The building of this church
[1:35:01] has always been the building of God's
[1:35:04] people has always been in troublesome
[1:35:08] time.
[1:35:10] God will promise Abraham
[1:35:14] that your seed will sow John to this
[1:35:16] land. I will give them this land. Praise
[1:35:19] the Lord. Why couldn't he just settle
[1:35:22] Jacob and his family in the land? They
[1:35:25] were already in the land of Canaa. He
[1:35:27] had to drive them to Egypt to bring them
[1:35:30] back. Why?
[1:35:33] He could have just settled them right
[1:35:35] there, blessed them, blessed the land
[1:35:38] because they are sheep herders.
[1:35:42] He had to take them into Egypt. They had
[1:35:45] to experience troublesome time under the
[1:35:49] whip of Egyptians.
[1:35:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Just so he can bring his tabernacle
[1:35:59] among them.
[1:36:03] It will have just been easy from Abraham
[1:36:06] to Isaac, from Isaac to Jacob, Jacob and
[1:36:09] his uh his 12 son. And it's still right
[1:36:12] there. I mean, it will just be so easy.
[1:36:15] They will not have to deal with all of
[1:36:17] the complex
[1:36:23] because of the suffering that they went
[1:36:26] through.
[1:36:30] But God don't build the way that man's
[1:36:32] built.
[1:36:34] Praise the Lord. He don't build in the
[1:36:38] way that man's built. He don't build the
[1:36:40] time that man's built.
[1:36:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:47] Let me tell you now, all of you young
[1:36:50] people that are so fancy in your mind, I
[1:36:52] mean, you're having you're having a a a
[1:36:55] fancy homecoming for your family, you
[1:36:57] know, uh uh you know, and uh you just
[1:37:00] have it so rosy in your mind. Oh, when I
[1:37:03] get married, this is the way it will be,
[1:37:05] then this is the way it will be. That's
[1:37:06] your plan. That's your blueprint. Please
[1:37:10] ask God for his
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; because God do not build the way that
[1:37:18] men's built.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Ask God for his blueprint.
[1:37:25] Praise the Lord. You can choose the the
[1:37:28] fancy rosy color and the fancy thing,
[1:37:30] you know, and it's just it's just a
[1:37:32] dynamic family in your mind. Oh my god,
[1:37:35] we just would just be happy. I mean, we
[1:37:37] not deal with all of these stuff that
[1:37:38] people are dealing. I don't know how how
[1:37:40] come people can't just get together.
[1:37:46] Ah.
[1:37:48] Oh my goodness me.
[1:37:52] I love you Lord
[1:37:55] for your mercy never failed me.
[1:38:02] Oh my. You love the Lord.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's preach some.
[1:38:07] Amen. The church has never been built in
[1:38:10] easy time. The church has gone from
[1:38:12] being misunderstood. It has gone from
[1:38:14] being persecuted. Let's just read a
[1:38:16] little bit of why Paul says here in 2
[1:38:18] Corinthians chapter 4.
[1:38:21] This is one of the guy that understand
[1:38:23] this thing. Amen. The very man that was
[1:38:25] persecuting the church came to
[1:38:27] understand when he saw the blueprint at
[1:38:30] the back side of the desert.
[1:38:37] 2 Corinthians chapter 4.
[1:38:43] That's the thing that is killing the
[1:38:44] church. Intellectual faith, intellectual
[1:38:47] believers.
[1:38:49] They are very quick to say the Bible
[1:38:51] says, the the prophet says, and they
[1:38:53] don't have nothing inside to back it up.
[1:38:59] They don't have nothing inside to submit
[1:39:01] them to that very thing that they are
[1:39:03] quoting.
[1:39:07] Oh, glory be to God.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody prayed for me.
[1:39:15] They had me on their mind.
[1:39:18] They took a time and prayed for me.
[1:39:23] I'm so glad you did.
[1:39:26] I'm so glad you did.
[1:39:30] I'm so glad you prayed for me. 2
[1:39:33] Corinthians chapter 4. Let's read Paul
[1:39:36] who says here that uh uh
[1:39:41] reading from verse 8. He says, "We are
[1:39:43] troubled on every side yet not
[1:39:46] distressed. We are perplexed not
[1:39:48] despised. Persecuted but not forsaken.
[1:39:52] We are cast down but not distraught.
[1:39:55] always bearing about in the body the
[1:39:57] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[1:40:01] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:40:03] our body.
[1:40:06] Praise the Lord. Amen. He take us
[1:40:09] through all of this that the life of the
[1:40:13] Lord Jesus might be ma made manifest in
[1:40:15] our body. Verse 11, for we which live
[1:40:19] are always delivered unto death for
[1:40:22] Jesus sake. Praise the Lord. We will
[1:40:26] always find something we have to die to.
[1:40:30] As long as we live for God, there will
[1:40:33] always be something you will have to die
[1:40:36] to for Jesus sake. That the life
[1:40:41] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:40:43] made manifest in your mortal flesh.
[1:40:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:50] So then death walketh in us but life in
[1:40:53] you. And how does this happen?
[1:40:57] Verse seven, we drop back to verse
[1:40:59] seven. This is what he says here. But we
[1:41:02] have this treasure
[1:41:04] in e vessel. All of these things that we
[1:41:07] going through, there is a treasure that
[1:41:10] is in vessel that God is protecting.
[1:41:14] Praise the Lord. There is a treasure
[1:41:16] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:41:19] of God and not of ourself.
[1:41:22] This is just a vessel that has a
[1:41:25] treasure in it.
[1:41:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:32] No matter what happened to this vessel,
[1:41:34] it do not touch the treasure. Remember
[1:41:37] what God told Job? Do with him whatever
[1:41:40] you want to do, but don't touch the
[1:41:42] treasure.
[1:41:44] Don't touch the treasure.
[1:41:48] You can beat the the the vessel, you
[1:41:51] know, put bombs on it, everything, but
[1:41:54] don't touch the treasure
[1:41:57] because it was an empty vessel
[1:42:00] that had heavenly treasure in it.
[1:42:06] Are we together?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:17] So you see that all truth. You ever say
[1:42:20] God will come down and and bring these
[1:42:23] people in the wilderness and tell them I
[1:42:26] want to bring my tabernacle.
[1:42:28] I want to build my tabernacle that you
[1:42:31] all will be a family of priests.
[1:42:34] It could have been easy for him to do
[1:42:36] that with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He
[1:42:38] did not have to bring them through. But
[1:42:41] God love to build in troublesome time.
[1:42:47] He love to build it. You know why he
[1:42:49] love to build it? Because when all the
[1:42:52] troubles are happening,
[1:42:55] the enemy don't see what he's doing.
[1:43:00] Praise the Lord. When all the troubles
[1:43:02] are happening
[1:43:04] and fighting and everything, the enemy
[1:43:07] don't see it. When God is planting the
[1:43:10] cornerstones and he laying solid
[1:43:12] foundation and he putting beams in the
[1:43:15] building,
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; the enemy don't see that. All he see, oh
[1:43:18] yeah, they are having trouble. Oh yeah,
[1:43:20] yeah, they are having trouble. But
[1:43:23] that's when God fortify his building.
[1:43:26] That when he fortify his people,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; when he take them through,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; troublesome time.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:44] That's when he fortify his building.
[1:43:47] Praise the Lord. He allow it to shake
[1:43:50] back and forth
[1:43:52] to see whether the material can stand
[1:43:55] the test of time.
[1:43:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:59] Sit down there be crying. God is
[1:44:02] building his house. He's building his
[1:44:04] people. You sit down there be crying.
[1:44:07] Amen. Just be weeping. You are some kind
[1:44:09] of a cry baby.
[1:44:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:20] Oh, I love the Lord this morning. Amen.
[1:44:23] Blessed be the name of the Lord. What a
[1:44:25] wonderful time. What a wonderful Jesus.
[1:44:28] What a wonderful Jesus. See what he says
[1:44:30] here.
[1:44:33] So we will see Jesus. Then then we are
[1:44:37] watched by the water of the word. Amen.
[1:44:40] Become a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:44:44] And the the and the signs that Jesus
[1:44:47] said follow him will follow them. Every
[1:44:51] man, every woman will come to her place
[1:44:53] and every man will come to his place and
[1:44:56] the spirit of God will come to his place
[1:45:00] and the church of the living God will be
[1:45:04] spotless.
[1:45:05] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:45:09] Because now you see people look at the
[1:45:11] oh I mean the rapture can't take see
[1:45:15] what is happening in that church see
[1:45:17] what is happening in that church see
[1:45:18] what is happen it's troublesome time but
[1:45:21] that's the time where God likes to build
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord while all of these
[1:45:26] things are happening God is bringing
[1:45:28] sons to their place daughters to their
[1:45:30] place wife to their place praise the
[1:45:33] Lord husband to their face.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; All you can see is the trouble. Praise
[1:45:41] the Lord. Hallelujah. All we can, oh
[1:45:44] yeah, see what that thing happen. Oh,
[1:45:46] see what is happening in that church and
[1:45:47] see what Praise the Lord. What are you
[1:45:50] doing about it
[1:45:56] and the spirit of God will come to its
[1:45:59] place and the church of the living God
[1:46:02] will be spotless. God will do it.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; When he says, "I will build my church."
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; He says, "It will be spotless."
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will build my church. The
[1:46:15] gates of hell will not prevail against
[1:46:17] it."
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And he says, "It will be spotless."
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Call it what? You may
[1:46:29] talk about it. How? How? You may. But he
[1:46:33] said, "I will build my church."
[1:46:36] And he says, "I will give myself a
[1:46:37] spotless
[1:46:39] without no wrinkle, no crack."
[1:46:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How can a church be built in
[1:46:48] troublesome time? How can a building be
[1:46:50] built in troublesome time and there is
[1:46:53] no crack?
[1:46:57] Praise the Lord. Because every fallen
[1:47:00] word is refined and put back into the
[1:47:03] building. Everything you go through as
[1:47:06] an experience, as a failure in your
[1:47:08] life, God refined them and he put it
[1:47:10] back in your life.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why as long as you
[1:47:14] live, you will never forget about it.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; It depends on what you do with it.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel good. Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:33] Building in troublesome time. I've
[1:47:36] already put all my cars on the table.
[1:47:38] You know where I'm going now. Amen.
[1:47:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:43] Hallelujah.
[1:47:46] Everything that God built. Everything he
[1:47:49] built. When God build a man, praise the
[1:47:53] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:47:56] When he built a man, he took the dust of
[1:47:58] the earth.
[1:48:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:06] That was on the sixth day of creation
[1:48:11] after he start separating the water from
[1:48:14] the land and and and and and creating
[1:48:16] trees and and and and trying to put some
[1:48:18] order.
[1:48:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:27] He built Adam and Eve. It comes to a to
[1:48:30] a garden. It comes to consciousness. But
[1:48:34] Bam say his toes were sticking in the
[1:48:35] earth like roots, like plain roots. And
[1:48:38] he, you know, he he he kicks that off.
[1:48:40] He comes to consciousness. Oh my God. Oh
[1:48:43] my God. That's beautiful. That's
[1:48:46] beautiful.
[1:48:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:50] Eve come also. She's surprised. And
[1:48:52] Adam, so why? She's flesh of my flesh,
[1:48:54] bones of my bone. It looks like
[1:48:56] perfection.
[1:48:58] But that's just one side of the story.
[1:49:02] Praise the Lord. You have to get into
[1:49:04] the building.
[1:49:07] And there is no way for you to be a
[1:49:08] builder and don't be missed with dirt.
[1:49:13] Praise the Lord. Even if you are just a
[1:49:15] supervisor that wear glasses and cap on
[1:49:18] your head, the all the dust that is
[1:49:19] blowing is going to dead your glasses.
[1:49:22] Praise the Lord. So to to be part of the
[1:49:24] building, they had to get into the dead.
[1:49:28] Praise the Lord. Uh h Genesis 3, sin hit
[1:49:31] the came and back into earth to win.
[1:49:33] They are ashamed. They are crying. They
[1:49:35] are confused
[1:49:37] and their trouble starts. It starts to
[1:49:40] feel aching pains.
[1:49:45] Praise the Lord. It starts to be
[1:49:47] disappointed.
[1:49:49] It starts to run away from the very
[1:49:51] animal that they have commanded.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Fear starts to set in a year. The year
[1:49:58] that a king has killed Abel. What is
[1:50:01] happening?
[1:50:07] It looks like chaos. It looks like
[1:50:09] confusion. But God was laying a
[1:50:13] foundation stone.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If people will just
[1:50:19] learn to pause and say, "Lord, what's
[1:50:23] going on?"
[1:50:25] When things don't seem right,
[1:50:28] when it's not making sense,
[1:50:31] if we would just stop running our mouth,
[1:50:35] because it's what you say that the devil
[1:50:37] brings back to your mind.
[1:50:41] Everything you think about is what is
[1:50:42] coming out of your mouth.
[1:50:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:49] He just he's just following your your
[1:50:51] your the path of your conversation.
[1:50:59] He said, I I don't know why. He said,
[1:51:00] okay, I will tell you why nobody love
[1:51:03] you.
[1:51:05] There is no need of you even serving
[1:51:07] God. I will tell you why. You don't know
[1:51:08] why. You don't know why you're going
[1:51:10] through what you I will tell you.
[1:51:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:21] Oh my,
[1:51:24] what an awesome God we serve. Amen.
[1:51:27] What a wonderful God. I gave her a
[1:51:29] vision to Daniel. Let's just read
[1:51:31] something here. Daniel, no doubt. But
[1:51:33] what he he told him that the 70 weeks,
[1:51:38] I mean the 70 years was about finished.
[1:51:41] 68 just like two years and we and we
[1:51:46] find out that Jeremiah prophecy hit just
[1:51:50] exactly right. Two years later they went
[1:51:53] out.
[1:51:55] Nehemiah's went and got an and got an ed
[1:52:01] sorry and build the walls in troublesome
[1:52:04] time. They they work. Praise the Lord.
[1:52:08] Amen. 70 weeks yet he followed the same
[1:52:11] thought. He says, "And and and and many
[1:52:13] of us remember when it was built,
[1:52:16] talking about the the walls, the the
[1:52:18] walls of Jerusalem, they had the mortar
[1:52:21] blocks in one hand and a swore in the
[1:52:24] other to wash the enemy. It will be
[1:52:27] built in troublesome time." That's what
[1:52:29] the prophecy said.
[1:52:31] from the restoration
[1:52:34] of Jerusalem.
[1:52:36] From the restoration and the building of
[1:52:39] Jerusalem, the streets,
[1:52:44] the streets, the wall, the gates,
[1:52:47] everything will be built in troublesome
[1:52:50] time.
[1:52:52] And I believe that's the same thing that
[1:52:53] God is doing to his people. Every part
[1:52:56] of your life from justification,
[1:52:57] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:53:00] Ghost will not be a theory. It will be
[1:53:02] an experience.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; You will experience the fire of God in
[1:53:06] your heart.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fire of God that would take
[1:53:09] the desire of sin away.
[1:53:15] Praise the Lord. You won't make excuses
[1:53:19] when God can can can be able to deliver.
[1:53:22] If God if God can be able to raise the
[1:53:24] dead,
[1:53:26] what's about taking unclean habits from
[1:53:28] our lives,
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; it's because we don't we we we we have
[1:53:34] not gone far for the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:53:36] It's not an idea, people. It's a
[1:53:38] reality.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; And that's what we need for this hour
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; because wickedness will just increase
[1:53:45] and increase and increase. That's what
[1:53:48] we need for this hour. a truth
[1:53:50] experience with God.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Every part from the from the restoration
[1:54:06] to the building, every part will be
[1:54:08] built in troublesome time.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:20] You think that that that is just that is
[1:54:23] just Solomon temple that we are living
[1:54:25] in the same time here you're fighting
[1:54:27] all of these things that you know people
[1:54:29] posting red half for red half or you
[1:54:31] know uh uh Israel was going to make
[1:54:33] their sacrifice they saw the black head
[1:54:34] in the red half so you know they just
[1:54:36] did a testing and all of those things
[1:54:39] you know uh uh uh uh they are getting
[1:54:42] back to sacrifice they need a temple and
[1:54:44] all of these things and and you see what
[1:54:46] is happening in the Middle East
[1:54:49] It's going to be right in the time of
[1:54:52] trouble.
[1:54:54] You check Israel history, that's how it
[1:54:56] has been. You check the the the the the
[1:54:59] the sequence of scripture, that's the
[1:55:02] way that God has dealt with his people.
[1:55:05] That's why he says when they say peace,
[1:55:08] peace, suddenly comes destruction.
[1:55:15] Suddenly comes destruction.
[1:55:21] Because just like how the eagle stirred
[1:55:24] up his nets, that's the way that God
[1:55:27] deal with his people. This word is not
[1:55:30] our home, you know, he just give us
[1:55:31] grace and give a home, give us family,
[1:55:34] for us to support one another, you know,
[1:55:36] and to make our joining h easier. It's
[1:55:39] not to settle down and and and and build
[1:55:41] castles for ourselves.
[1:55:44] is to be able to take ourel from one
[1:55:46] stage to another stage in our walk
[1:55:50] for you to have somebody that this that
[1:55:52] say I has your back. I'm praying for
[1:55:53] you. God bless you.
[1:55:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:03] That's the reason why in the least
[1:56:04] moment when the people are not expecting
[1:56:07] it, that eagle mother comes right there.
[1:56:09] She get rid of the net cuz she don't
[1:56:11] want spo.
[1:56:13] She want babies that can make wings,
[1:56:15] make use of of their wings,
[1:56:19] make use of their claw to go and hunt
[1:56:21] and they're big to eat.
[1:56:24] So she just get rid of the net.
[1:56:27] When they fly back, they don't see. They
[1:56:28] just be going, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[1:56:30] whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa." They'll
[1:56:31] find their way.
[1:56:33] But God bill in troublesome time.
[1:56:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:41] Building in troublesome time.
[1:56:45] Oh, I thank you, Jesus.
[1:56:48] Thank you, Jesus. You know, you you put
[1:56:52] your heart before the Lord. You just you
[1:56:54] just cried. You say, "Lord, what's going
[1:56:55] on?
[1:56:57] What's going on?" You know, I've uh you
[1:57:00] know, my my birth was in uh a little bit
[1:57:03] out of season. You know, when I when we
[1:57:06] came to the Lord, we came right in the
[1:57:08] time of uh you know, some action, some
[1:57:10] some revival, something that was
[1:57:12] stirring our heart. You know, just don't
[1:57:15] just don't feel satisfied. You see
[1:57:17] people coming to church on Sunday. There
[1:57:19] is more to that. Amen.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; There is more that we can do for God.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:29] The message is not only to be preached.
[1:57:31] We must carry a home. It must go home
[1:57:35] with us
[1:57:37] as it must go to our hearts. Let's carry
[1:57:39] it home. Let's live it home.
[1:57:44] Let's see the other in our lives, in our
[1:57:47] family.
[1:57:54] What a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[1:57:57] Listen to this. You love the Lord. Let's
[1:58:00] give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen.
[1:58:04] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:58:07] He's wanted to be praised.
[1:58:09] Hallelujah.
[1:58:11] Amen.
[1:58:17] You know when you cheer for the world
[1:58:18] like this, then I feel like you are not
[1:58:20] afraid. I'm not scaring you.
[1:58:24] Now look, see remembering the Lord.
[1:58:26] Let's let's look at this. Look at this.
[1:58:27] This is this is very beautiful. Look at
[1:58:29] this. Think about it. Gifts. Gifts of
[1:58:32] God and things are not are not something
[1:58:35] that that just that just play with that
[1:58:38] we just play with. The gift of God are
[1:58:41] gracious
[1:58:44] and they are wearing they are worrisome.
[1:58:49] Praise the Lord. Tell me that is
[1:58:51] worrisome.
[1:58:54] I have to say is I'm just I just feel
[1:58:56] like some kind of a useless creature. I
[1:58:58] don't know what to do with my life. I
[1:59:00] just you know I'm just all me that's up
[1:59:03] in my mind but uh
[1:59:06] the gift of God they are worrisome
[1:59:09] listen to this now in the presence of
[1:59:11] God is now shouting the presence of God
[1:59:16] that's just the blessing
[1:59:18] he pours upon the people when we are
[1:59:21] rejoicing in the word
[1:59:24] when we are rejoicing in the word or the
[1:59:26] Lord do something for you and and you
[1:59:29] know you are happy and you are
[1:59:30] testifying
[1:59:32] it's it's just the blessings of God.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; It's just the blessings are just like
[1:59:39] the Bible says it's just a due drop
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; that has fall upon you.
[1:59:47] Glory be to God. But let's follow this
[1:59:50] now.
[1:59:52] See, but the presence of God is a
[1:59:57] troublesome thing. Now let me ask you,
[2:00:00] will you want the blessings or his
[2:00:02] presence?
[2:00:08] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:10] Amen.
[2:00:12] Well, you know your answer in your
[2:00:13] heart. Even if you don't say it. Amen.
[2:00:18] You know your answer in your heart.
[2:00:20] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:00:23] But I I I think I think we will want his
[2:00:26] presence.
[2:00:28] Amen. We will want his presence,
[2:00:32] but his presence is a troublesome thing.
[2:00:39] His presence is not just rubbing you in
[2:00:43] a rough spot for you to go to sleep.
[2:00:46] His presence is terrifying.
[2:00:50] his presence. Every time his presence
[2:00:53] comes closer, demons are all scattering
[2:00:56] over the places and throwing things
[2:00:59] everywhere and it looks like what is
[2:01:01] happening to my life? But you say you
[2:01:03] want his presence.
[2:01:08] When his presence was coming to the
[2:01:10] disciples on the ship, they thought that
[2:01:12] it was a ghost.
[2:01:16] Amen.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; They were right. Peter, have you seen
[2:01:22] this before? I never saw the scripture
[2:01:24] that it was his presence
[2:01:29] because you can have his blessings and
[2:01:32] you can spend it and you will need it
[2:01:34] again.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You can have his
[2:01:38] blessing and you can spend it and you
[2:01:41] will need it again. The Lord can bless
[2:01:43] you in your home, bless you in your
[2:01:45] finance, bless you at work, and uh you
[2:01:48] know and and you can spend it.
[2:01:51] You can run out of it.
[2:01:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:59] His presence is troublesome.
[2:02:04] It's terrifying.
[2:02:08] Glory be to God.
[2:02:10] That's the reason why you get down in
[2:02:12] his presence and you stay there and you
[2:02:14] start praying and you getting lost in
[2:02:16] praying. It looks like creatures are
[2:02:18] moving on your back. When you start
[2:02:20] getting lost and his presence is coming
[2:02:22] near to you, you feel like somebody in
[2:02:25] the room you want to yell
[2:02:36] because his present is terrifying.
[2:02:41] Glory be to God.
[2:02:46] But he promised us his presence.
[2:02:49] He says, "I will never leave you. I will
[2:02:52] never forsake you." He promised us his
[2:02:55] presence.
[2:02:58] But we have become a man running from
[2:03:00] the presence of the Lord. That's why we
[2:03:03] have become we are just picking up the
[2:03:06] little blessings from the ground. Oh
[2:03:07] yeah, the Lord gave me the new suit
[2:03:10] and we are running from his presence
[2:03:12] when really what he want to give us is
[2:03:14] his presence.
[2:03:20] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, may God. May God help us people.
[2:03:31] May God help us. Because if God don't
[2:03:32] help us, we can stay around this thing
[2:03:35] all of our life
[2:03:37] and never come to the reality of what we
[2:03:40] have been with.
[2:03:43] We can stay around this thing.
[2:03:47] Those disciples stay with Jesus and he
[2:03:50] taught them.
[2:03:52] Matthew chapter 12, St. John chapter 12,
[2:03:55] 13, 144, 15, he's telling them about the
[2:03:58] comforter. He's telling them, "I must go
[2:04:00] away." It never became real to them.
[2:04:07] Even when they saw him being nailed on
[2:04:08] the cross, they say if that man can
[2:04:10] raise up a dead body, he can vanish from
[2:04:13] on that cross, it never stay become
[2:04:16] became real to them.
[2:04:21] We are taking this thing for granted
[2:04:23] people. We are taking it for granted.
[2:04:27] Yes, we are taking it for granted. It
[2:04:30] had just become court
[2:04:34] and and we just counting our years that
[2:04:36] we have stayed. Those people stayed 40
[2:04:39] years. They ate mana. They saw the
[2:04:42] pillow of fire at night.
[2:04:48] But every one of them died in the
[2:04:49] wilderness because it became so common
[2:04:52] to them.
[2:04:54] It became so common to them.
[2:05:08] But the presence of God is a troublesome
[2:05:10] thing. It's a troublesome thing. That's
[2:05:13] the reason why you will see every time
[2:05:15] you try to to to to to make some form of
[2:05:18] commitment, some some form of devotion
[2:05:20] in your life, it it looks like that's
[2:05:22] the time you get so busy and things just
[2:05:25] keep flying, you know, and then you get
[2:05:27] the cell phone there also to fill with
[2:05:29] all bunch of junk that is happening on
[2:05:32] Facebook and Tik Tok and all of that
[2:05:34] thing and you cannot even concentrate
[2:05:38] just at a time where you're thinking
[2:05:40] Lord I you know I I want to pray and and
[2:05:42] and all of that. That's when some kind
[2:05:45] of a stupid message cometh. Then it it
[2:05:47] just bust up your laptop.
[2:05:54] That's the devil's greatest weapon.
[2:05:57] Distraction.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; That's all he has to do.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He can't take the love
[2:06:03] of God from your heart, but he can
[2:06:05] distract you.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; He can distract you. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:12] that you are never able to show true
[2:06:15] affection to this God you love.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; This thing is becoming so common to us
[2:06:29] and we are just slowly just falling into
[2:06:31] that intellectual realm.
[2:06:35] All our experience is just numbers we
[2:06:37] can count on our hands. have been in the
[2:06:39] message 5 years, 10 years and this that
[2:06:42] that's all we can we can we can count
[2:06:44] when there is more of God
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; to know more of God to experience
[2:06:51] more of God to feel in our hearts to
[2:06:54] change our life.
[2:06:58] Is there anything too hard for the Lord?
[2:07:10] Are we together?
[2:07:13] Try to wrap this because
[2:07:17] I have put the bait in the water. You
[2:07:18] have bite it. I don't know. We might we
[2:07:22] might take this for for some time.
[2:07:26] We might take it for some time.
[2:07:33] unveiling of God. He says, "And in this
[2:07:35] troublesome hour that we are living
[2:07:36] nation against nation, pestilence,
[2:07:39] earthquakes
[2:07:41] in many places men have failing for
[2:07:43] fear."
[2:07:45] We see the handwriting on the wall and
[2:07:47] and and and uh he says now that is in
[2:07:52] the natural realm everything that we see
[2:07:54] happening.
[2:07:56] Amen. everything we see happen. That's
[2:07:58] that's the reason why I believe it was
[2:08:00] just a beautiful service Wednesday
[2:08:02] night. Brother Jab spoke uh uh American
[2:08:06] politics in a way that uh you could feel
[2:08:09] uncomfortable because you might think
[2:08:11] that he's supporting Trump. No, he's
[2:08:14] only he's only waking our attention.
[2:08:19] To this country, rising up as a dragon.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; That's all he was doing. He's not
[2:08:24] preaching politics. That's not what I
[2:08:27] call preaching politics but because I
[2:08:28] don't preach politics on the pit and I
[2:08:31] will frown against it if I think it was
[2:08:33] politics he was preaching but it's a
[2:08:35] place where a man is he he's awaken the
[2:08:38] people and say see what is happening
[2:08:41] look at this thing right in the
[2:08:42] scripture
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; now so uh uh Uh but but all of those
[2:08:57] things are in the natural realm.
[2:09:01] We see all of these things that is
[2:09:03] happening around.
[2:09:06] Is it raising your faith? That's my
[2:09:08] question I will ask to you. Is it
[2:09:09] raising your faith? Is he giving you
[2:09:12] faith to to approach God and seek God or
[2:09:16] are you nursing on fear?
[2:09:20] Are you sucking a fear bottle?
[2:09:25] Is that all it's giving you?
[2:09:32] When Jesus says live for your hair, your
[2:09:34] redemption draw night. And if the
[2:09:36] redemption draw night, there is a redemp
[2:09:38] a redeemer that brings the redemption.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:48] Because definitely with with everything
[2:09:50] that is happening around us and the the
[2:09:52] the the economic condition of the world
[2:09:55] and the political condition, it's easy.
[2:09:57] It's it's it's a natural thing. It's a
[2:10:00] very natural thing for your mind to feed
[2:10:03] on fear. But that's not where God want
[2:10:06] you to be.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just in the midst of confusion and
[2:10:11] chaos, he's building faith in his
[2:10:13] people. Faith that will make you to rise
[2:10:15] above the condition.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; That is in the natural mind. That's all
[2:10:33] the word should see.
[2:10:36] But now there is a spiritual realm. If
[2:10:39] all these things are taking place in the
[2:10:43] natural realm, when the scripture says
[2:10:45] when the enemy come as a flawed,
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God will raise up a
[2:10:52] standard.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Are you so scared of the floor that you
[2:10:59] don't even know that there is a spirit
[2:11:00] that is lifting you up?
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; That you are drowning yourself. He's
[2:11:06] lifting you up, trying to carry you up.
[2:11:09] You turn yourself around, put your foot
[2:11:11] in his hand, and still sticking your
[2:11:13] head under the water. And you say you
[2:11:15] believe in God.
[2:11:19] Your faith is an intellectual faith.
[2:11:25] It's an intellectual faith. Because let
[2:11:28] an intellectual faith be challenged.
[2:11:30] Fear, it starts to rebel.
[2:11:37] When a divine faith is challenged, it
[2:11:39] stands on the word. It says, "I know my
[2:11:42] redeemer live in it."
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; It says, "Greater is he that is in me
[2:11:46] than he that is in a word." That's what
[2:11:48] a divine faith says.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, though you slay me,
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; I will save you." That's what a divine
[2:11:58] faith will say.
[2:12:02] Living in a generation we back up so
[2:12:04] easily, quick to find way of escape.
[2:12:08] We're looking for holes. When will we
