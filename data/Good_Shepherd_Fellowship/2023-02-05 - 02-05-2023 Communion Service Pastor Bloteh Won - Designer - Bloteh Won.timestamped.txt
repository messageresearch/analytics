[26:57] before we go into the service tonight
[27:00] and before we pray the
[27:03] uh
[27:04] [Music]
[27:07] just at the time I we will
[27:10] preparing a communion
[27:12] in the office and uh
[27:15] getting the service ready for tonight
[27:18] uh there was there was a text message
[27:21] that came through my phone a WhatsApp
[27:24] message by the way from uh from overseas
[27:27] and uh
[27:30] and now I want to play something I was I
[27:33] was playing the book of Isaiah chapter
[27:34] 50 what I Was preparing the communion
[27:39] 53 actually
[27:41] and uh so I took my phone and
[27:46] I wanted to have my audio Bible going
[27:49] and then I fed on the on the message
[27:51] there
[27:52] uh one of our
[27:56] dear beloved brother that's uh brother
[27:59] Gideon retief
[28:01] there's willing retief son
[28:03] he took over the pastorship from his dad
[28:07] when
[28:12] brother Branham went over to South
[28:14] Africa the church that hosted brother
[28:17] Branham but a willy retief came out of
[28:20] that church
[28:21] and then
[28:23] even though the original people
[28:26] uh church group their host their brother
[28:29] Branham
[28:30] try to create a lot of uh
[28:35] uh what I say problem because of the way
[28:37] the meetings were set
[28:39] you know they set the meeting in a way
[28:41] where
[28:42] uh you know they want the brother
[28:45] Branham to go by the way they said
[28:47] things
[28:48] but then over the years uh Brother Willy
[28:51] retief and some of the other brothers
[28:52] that came out that embraced the message
[28:55] uh
[28:56] [Music]
[28:58] they were the kind of a pioneer of
[29:02] spreading the message in South Africa
[29:04] and all the South Team part of Africa
[29:10] he went to be with the Lord I think two
[29:13] years ago if I'm right and then his son
[29:16] Gideon took over the church
[29:18] so the text message came true he was on
[29:21] his way to church this morning and got a
[29:24] Hot and Hot attack
[29:26] and he went into led into an accident
[29:31] and he also went to be with the Lord
[29:36] so it's a kind of a hard thing for the
[29:39] uh the church did and and generally for
[29:42] the country
[29:43] because like I said upon near the
[29:46] message over the years
[29:51] I was there when I was there December I
[29:54] was talking with one of the
[29:57] the
[29:59] I was here one of the headers to brother
[30:01] uh Owen Palm he was pastoring the church
[30:05] over in Kimberling the the Diamond city
[30:09] of South Africa
[30:10] so he was giving me some of the history
[30:13] when he began and because they all were
[30:16] going there I will received Church
[30:19] and he was giving me some of the history
[30:21] how things were at the time and then you
[30:24] have to also understand you know uh the
[30:28] message the prophet went down there
[30:30] during the time of our podcast and you
[30:32] know and all the division and everything
[30:34] but they were able to manage to live up
[30:37] Jesus in the midst of all of that praise
[30:39] the Lord
[30:40] so uh
[30:43] we will we will pray for their hurting
[30:46] family
[30:46] and
[30:48] and many families that are hurting
[30:51] physically
[30:54] sicilis is preparing to travel like I
[30:56] said this morning so let's just go to
[30:59] the Lord in prayer
[31:02] and uh
[31:06] if we just pray together
[31:09] that the law will just bring comfort
[31:12] the law will bless them with comfort
[31:15] think about his children that think
[31:17] about about the church
[31:21] you know he was working very close with
[31:23] his dad so the church knew obviously
[31:26] that he was going to take over the
[31:28] pastorship
[31:29] but they were just settling down with
[31:31] him yeah thank you that's our brother
[31:34] Gideon retief
[31:35] and uh
[31:38] they were just settling down with him as
[31:41] as their Pastor then
[31:44] enjoying the transition and all of that
[31:47] so
[31:49] let's just let's just buy our hairs and

[46:57] to just speak on a little talk that I
[46:59] make her is thine husband
[47:01] amen now just like I said we go straight
[47:04] back to to marriage in Davos I send the
[47:08] uh the few notes that I wanted to just
[47:10] go over tonight now you'll remember like
[47:13] we said Wednesday night brother Brandon
[47:15] refer back to uh Danny Herron uh
[47:19] prophecy because the subject of marriage
[47:22] and divorce was going to be a high
[47:24] subject
[47:25] but being the messenger of the hour the
[47:29] tax was given to him for him to be able
[47:31] to bring the word of truth because there
[47:34] were there was a lot of mix of that on
[47:37] the entire subject of marriage and
[47:38] divorce people had a lot of
[47:40] interpretation amen you go back to the
[47:43] Bible you see it and then he make us to
[47:47] know that uh uh
[47:50] by the grace of God he took a high
[47:52] choice right from the beginning of his
[47:55] ministry to be able to stay with nothing
[47:57] but thus said the Lord
[47:59] amen and another high Choice he had to
[48:03] you know uh trust the Lord to be able to
[48:06] guide him I mean not not how the the
[48:10] privilege to be out of high school or go
[48:13] to theological school and uh he had to
[48:17] hired God to help his ignorance amen now
[48:21] so uh uh but then as he as he brings the
[48:24] message brother Brandon if you follow
[48:27] the tip this morning or you've been
[48:29] you've been playing the tip at home
[48:31] studying you will realize that he came
[48:34] to this place
[48:36] where he started uh
[48:39] uh dealing with the makeup of the woman
[48:44] praise the Lord when he started dealing
[48:47] with the makeup of the woman
[48:49] and and if you if you do remember
[48:53] uh
[48:58] I think I read that a couple of Sundays
[49:01] ago what brought a brand name you know
[49:04] he he spoke there he says uh
[49:07] [Music]
[49:10] I should have added this is all part
[49:13] from the same message
[49:23] but he was speaking here in you know and
[49:25] and trying to uh come for the church and
[49:29] make uh the the sisters to know then he
[49:32] says I hope our sisters will understand
[49:33] and out of there which of course I'm
[49:36] very sure that you are you are
[49:39] acquainted with amen
[49:54] okay let's just go to what we we send
[49:57] out there you grab the thought as we go
[49:59] along now he says but in the human race
[50:02] he's talking talking about uh uh
[50:08] is dealing with the subject of beauty
[50:10] and it's it is all about the woman here
[50:13] is the woman that's pretty now the man
[50:18] if he is there is something wrong amen
[50:23] there there is cross up see somewhere
[50:26] originally is that way in a sense like
[50:30] in every in every uh other uh uh species
[50:35] you realize the rooster and the hand you
[50:38] look at the The Lion and the Lioness and
[50:40] all of that he described that he says
[50:42] but when it comes to the human race the
[50:44] the woman was uh she was designed to be
[50:48] praying over in uh in uh Cod brother
[50:53] Branham says that's the makeup of the
[50:54] woman she can't help it she want to be
[50:57] pregnant that is the way she was made he
[51:00] says uh this is it is not bad if she you
[51:02] know will present herself decent it's
[51:05] just that she must not be like uh you
[51:07] know how like he said like a magnet
[51:09] passing through a tencent stone
[51:11] you know he says a magnet passing
[51:14] through a tensing Soul he says it just
[51:16] it just get it grabbed to anything you
[51:19] know and sticking on and Shining all
[51:22] over the place he she must not be like
[51:24] that but it's her makeup for her to be
[51:27] pretty praise the Lord that's the way
[51:29] that she's made
[51:30] now so he goes on yet he says uh
[51:35] he said wow was it done
[51:38] to deceive by
[51:41] her designer Satan is still working on
[51:46] her too in this last day
[51:50] praise the Lord
[51:54] the increase of of the beauty of women
[51:59] is showing the time of deception
[52:03] when did the church look any more
[52:05] prettier than it does today
[52:08] everything is fish is featuring great
[52:11] now I know when uh when you when we read
[52:15] there to deceive by her design or Satan
[52:19] now that's that's the place that I want
[52:21] to dwell on tonight because you see the
[52:24] uh that expression actually has made
[52:28] some people around the message believe
[52:31] that Satan is the one that designed the
[52:34] woman and gave her her future which of
[52:36] course is wrong I want to address that
[52:38] by the word tonight
[52:39] praise the Lord because I don't believe
[52:42] that's what brother Branham is teaching
[52:43] I can show you right in the scripture
[52:45] where he designed a woman
[52:47] Genesis chapter 3 let's go there
[52:56] because I've always I've always uh
[53:00] I've always uh
[53:03] fuss with this
[53:09] even though as as human we are the we
[53:12] are the the highest expression of God's
[53:15] creation
[53:16] amen because man was made in His image
[53:19] but if you look if you if you try to
[53:22] look at it in science life you will see
[53:24] that I mean generally the uh uh you look
[53:29] at the mail the way that God designed
[53:31] the mail and the way he designed the
[53:33] female you will see that uh uh even down
[53:38] in the animal life he gives uh you know
[53:40] everything that the female animal needs
[53:43] to be a mother to her to her little ones
[53:46] that's the same way he gives to the
[53:48] human everything that that the male uh
[53:51] needs to be a father you know that's the
[53:55] same thing so if if we get into that
[53:57] place and uh the the scriptures is let's
[54:01] let's just read yeah I'm figuring all
[54:04] over the place
[54:07] foreign
[54:13] was more subtitled than any beast of the
[54:16] field which the Lord God has made
[54:19] and he said unto the woman
[54:24] and he said unto the woman ye have God
[54:29] said
[54:30] ye shall not eat of every tree
[54:33] and a woman said unto the serpent we may
[54:37] eat of the tree
[54:39] we might eat of the fruit of the tree of
[54:42] the garden but of the fruit of the tree
[54:45] which is in the midst of the garden God
[54:48] said God have said ye shall not eat of
[54:52] it neither touch at least your dad and
[54:56] the serpent said unto the woman ye shall
[55:00] not surely die
[55:02] for God
[55:04] for God does know they are in the day so
[55:08] what is he this what is he doing
[55:11] he's designing the mind of the woman
[55:15] to get off the promise
[55:19] praise the Lord
[55:22] amen he's designing the mind of the
[55:25] woman to get off of the sacredness of
[55:29] God's word and what is he going to do
[55:32] design the mind of the woman to look her
[55:35] filth right
[55:38] taking her mind off of the original
[55:42] promise of God's word
[55:44] to introduce felt
[55:49] right I'll believe there's there's how
[55:51] he designed a woman I would not want to
[55:54] believe is is her makeup
[56:00] praise the Lord I will tell you I will
[56:02] tell you why I don't believe there
[56:04] because I have seen some of the devilish
[56:08] acts that have been behind these
[56:10] teachings
[56:11] some of the degrading art that have been
[56:14] behind this teaching
[56:16] praise the Lord
[56:17] because it is something that Society
[56:20] have struggled with
[56:23] Society have struggled with it in the
[56:26] fact that because of the misconception
[56:29] just like brother Brandon will says the
[56:31] Mist teaching that has been around
[56:34] misinterpretation of theologic that's
[56:37] the same thing that I brought a
[56:39] misconception and Mesa are teaching even
[56:42] even in the cyclone and traditional word
[56:47] what makes a uh uh other tribes and
[56:50] other religion
[56:52] struggle with the female
[56:56] praise the Lord it all goes back to this
[57:03] because if we don't understand
[57:06] if we don't understand and don't take
[57:08] God's word for what it says the Bible
[57:11] says Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 when God
[57:14] said let us make man
[57:16] in our image God made man male and
[57:20] female
[57:21] that's what the scripture says
[57:25] he make man male and female
[57:32] praise the Lord
[57:34] I mean cultures have struggled with it
[57:38] religion has struggle with it
[57:44] and I believe that uh this message is
[57:47] the law of Liberty that must set us free
[57:55] are we together
[57:58] because you will look and and and and
[58:00] and in that way
[58:03] that
[58:04] throughout the entire Bible it has been
[58:07] looked at that way
[58:09] because of the misinterpretation that
[58:12] comes from Genesis
[58:14] not understanding that uh uh that that
[58:17] that the woman was a part of the the the
[58:21] the the the original thought of God of
[58:24] creation
[58:27] when God was expressing that image in
[58:30] flesh is just the sequence
[58:34] that he expressed the man all of these
[58:36] things brother Branham will explain it
[58:39] to us and make us to understand
[58:42] it was all part of God's Plan of
[58:44] Redemption we'll read it right here this
[58:46] evening
[58:48] in God's Great design he designed it
[58:50] that way
[58:52] it was never to make the woman a second
[58:55] class or a cast down
[58:59] and that is the thing that Society has
[59:01] struggled with
[59:05] all of the thing we are struggling with
[59:08] uh LGBT and and uh uh uh Sexes and all
[59:13] of the things that we are struggling
[59:15] with it all comes goes back to this
[59:22] praise the Lord
[59:27] now so brother man let's let's read here
[59:30] now let's let's read and and uh uh and
[59:33] and follow the thought here but I had to
[59:35] I had to dash back because
[59:38] I didn't wanted to leave a question in
[59:40] your mind
[59:43] why was it done
[59:45] he said to deceive by
[59:47] for designer Satan is still working on
[59:51] her too in this last day how is he doing
[59:54] it
[59:55] is he shaping her body
[59:57] how is he doing he's doing it by
[59:59] perverting her mind
[1:00:02] when her body is supposed to be the
[1:00:05] temple of God when she's supposed to
[1:00:07] Value the three sacred virtue that God
[1:00:10] has given her
[1:00:13] she's using her body as a means of
[1:00:16] survival
[1:00:19] she was not made for that purpose
[1:00:25] are we together
[1:00:34] the increase of being of the of the
[1:00:37] beauty of the woman is showing the time
[1:00:39] of deception
[1:00:41] when did the church looks any more
[1:00:43] prettier than it is today everything is
[1:00:45] featuring great big fine building and
[1:00:48] you know millions of days and millions
[1:00:49] of that
[1:00:51] don't you see she their uh deception now
[1:00:55] there is nothing
[1:00:57] can stop like her
[1:01:00] and she is designed so that she can be
[1:01:06] deceiving
[1:01:11] and Satan is really working on her today
[1:01:16] in this last day because he is her
[1:01:19] designer
[1:01:22] I can prove that now
[1:01:25] to go right back
[1:01:27] at the beginning who started to work on
[1:01:32] her how did he start to work on her on
[1:01:36] her mind
[1:01:37] that's right here in Genesis chapter 3.
[1:01:41] it's not in Genesis chapter 2
[1:01:44] it's not in Genesis chapter one it's
[1:01:46] right here in Genesis chapter 3 how he
[1:01:49] starts to work on her on her mind
[1:01:55] to take up mine from the original
[1:01:58] picture of God's word
[1:02:03] and put her mind on the field of the
[1:02:05] flesh
[1:02:09] I don't have anything to do with the the
[1:02:12] create you you cannot make Satan her
[1:02:14] creator
[1:02:18] to believe that Satan gave her her
[1:02:20] physical future you are making Satan her
[1:02:24] creator
[1:02:25] brother never said Creator he said
[1:02:27] designer
[1:02:40] go right back to the beginning who
[1:02:42] started to work on her Adam or Satan
[1:02:47] why did he say Adam or Satan
[1:02:51] what is he coming back to Genesis
[1:02:53] chapter 3.
[1:02:59] praise the Lord
[1:03:05] do you think that Adam had to preach to
[1:03:08] her no I don't never had to preach to
[1:03:11] her because why
[1:03:12] she was taking out of him
[1:03:15] that's why they were co-equal
[1:03:18] right
[1:03:20] Adam never had to set her down and says
[1:03:22] you know uh uh uh uh you know God said
[1:03:27] we shouldn't do this you know uh God
[1:03:29] said we can speak we we can name that he
[1:03:31] didn't have to do it why because they
[1:03:34] were all both honor the same Covenant
[1:03:37] they were co-equal
[1:03:42] so he did not have to preach to her he
[1:03:44] did not have to teach her
[1:03:48] the man the woman like Paul says if the
[1:03:52] woman wants to learn anything let her
[1:03:54] ask her husband at home why because it
[1:03:57] goes back to Genesis 3 15 your husband
[1:04:00] will be the ruler
[1:04:02] that was a different Covenant that was a
[1:04:05] covenant after the fall
[1:04:08] that was when now God subject her to her
[1:04:11] husband to to for him to have the ruler
[1:04:14] over her
[1:04:18] praise the Lord
[1:04:23] now so why didn't uh uh uh uh
[1:04:28] so now you see here he says uh
[1:04:33] I can prove that to you go right back to
[1:04:35] the beginning
[1:04:40] who started to work on her Adam was hit
[1:04:43] on God or sit and see
[1:04:45] that's her designer
[1:04:48] is her Chief weapon to troll man
[1:04:54] to her to her field so so just just see
[1:04:59] where he's getting to
[1:05:02] see where he's underlining
[1:05:06] it will explain itself to make you to
[1:05:09] see what the prophet was saying
[1:05:12] do you know how many people this
[1:05:14] statement stumble
[1:05:16] that struggle with this
[1:05:26] so what is brother Branham online here
[1:05:29] what is he underlining
[1:05:32] that's her designer
[1:05:35] is her Chief weapon to throw men to her
[1:05:39] self that's what he's underlining
[1:05:43] when God made Eve in the beginning she
[1:05:46] was not filthy
[1:05:49] she was not filthy
[1:05:52] she never came from the hands of God as
[1:05:54] a fallen woman until she was deceived
[1:06:03] praise the Lord
[1:06:04] I will prove it to you also by size no
[1:06:07] girl is born from their mother broken
[1:06:13] no every girl that is born she's born
[1:06:21] she's born a virgin
[1:06:23] until her mind is perverted
[1:06:38] are we together
[1:06:51] it is our chief weapon to throw man to
[1:06:54] her failed being a pretty woman
[1:06:56] she she can sweat a man in a way she
[1:06:59] wants her brother
[1:07:01] any way she wants a brother is Aunt uh
[1:07:04] the the bootleg joined down here that
[1:07:08] gets the man is the pretty woman walking
[1:07:10] down the street twisting herself half
[1:07:13] dress
[1:07:17] that's the deceiver right there
[1:07:21] and she is dealing with it absolutely
[1:07:25] dealing
[1:07:27] she's dealing with what decent dress
[1:07:31] what is she dealing with
[1:07:33] what did he say
[1:07:34] is it not on the ball can you not answer
[1:07:36] me why is she dealing with half dress
[1:07:40] that's what he's talking about so every
[1:07:43] time I see point this out he he goes to
[1:07:47] uh uh the falling state of the woman
[1:07:52] every time he talks about deceiving he
[1:07:55] talks about the falling state of the
[1:07:57] woman
[1:08:04] today
[1:08:06] are we together
[1:08:18] you have to know that the devil is
[1:08:20] religious
[1:08:22] he's very religious brother Branham said
[1:08:24] he knew the principle of life
[1:08:27] amen he's very religious
[1:08:31] he's too bad like I've always always uh
[1:08:34] expressed yet he's too bad and and and
[1:08:37] there was there was there was nothing
[1:08:39] that made him so angry then when he
[1:08:41] heard God especially let's make man in
[1:08:44] our image amen
[1:08:46] and uh and and and and and then he stood
[1:08:48] by and and saw uh how God brought for
[1:08:52] all the creation and and and that God
[1:08:55] will create a darkness and God will pour
[1:08:58] the entire uh Universe to sleep to be
[1:09:01] able to bring out this woman
[1:09:05] that they ever knows there is something
[1:09:07] about the woman
[1:09:09] if he can get her in his hands he can be
[1:09:13] able to turn God's even upside down
[1:09:18] he knew that
[1:09:21] praise the Lord
[1:09:22] and being religious he had right on that
[1:09:27] to deceive every religion
[1:09:31] every religion I will tell you that is
[1:09:34] Christianity honor the baptism of the
[1:09:37] Holy Ghost that pour value on women
[1:09:41] every religion looks at a woman as a
[1:09:44] second class
[1:09:47] praise the Lord
[1:09:49] amen
[1:09:50] Israel is is Christianity honor the
[1:09:53] Baptist in honor the leadership of the
[1:09:56] Holy Ghost
[1:09:59] there are Parts the right value of God
[1:10:02] on the woman
[1:10:06] praise the Lord
[1:10:10] if you don't see their sheets of
[1:10:12] blessing rather you go into struggle
[1:10:14] with your wife if you don't see that
[1:10:16] she's a blessing you're going to even
[1:10:18] struggle with the way that God is
[1:10:20] dealing with you
[1:10:22] because the way that God is dealing with
[1:10:24] you you come under the female
[1:10:28] aspect
[1:10:31] you're going to deal you're going to
[1:10:33] struggle the way God is dealing with you
[1:10:39] nothing wrongs in tribal spirits around
[1:10:42] the world
[1:10:45] until different tribes they're all
[1:10:47] created for for male if you have a
[1:10:50] female child it looks like you don't you
[1:10:52] don't even have a child
[1:10:53] foreign
[1:10:55] from the beginning
[1:11:07] praise the Lord
[1:11:11] well I don't know if you were expecting
[1:11:13] this for communion service but
[1:11:21] however I won't take the entire evening
[1:11:27] foreign
[1:11:33] true
[1:11:36] praise the Lord
[1:11:40] that I call it a perverted understanding
[1:11:44] of Truth
[1:11:47] it's a perverted it's a limited
[1:11:49] understanding of Truth
[1:11:51] if you go back and really understand
[1:11:53] Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27 if you
[1:11:58] go back and study it
[1:12:03] and understand that that was the
[1:12:06] expression of God
[1:12:09] that's what his El Shadel because in God
[1:12:14] the place that gave life
[1:12:19] Jesus said how I will have longed to
[1:12:22] Harbor you not like the rooster
[1:12:28] but like the hand however her Young
[1:12:35] let me tell you is God that puts value
[1:12:41] because he knows the value of the woman
[1:12:45] and if you don't allow God to put value
[1:12:48] on you you want to look for some kind of
[1:12:50] a man or some kind of for media to put
[1:12:53] value on you or some kind of for culture
[1:12:55] you will be a lost being
[1:13:01] praise the Lord
[1:13:03] because in all of the way that the word
[1:13:06] is struggling for equality there is an
[1:13:09] evil see that is sold that they don't
[1:13:12] believe what they are struggling for
[1:13:14] they think they believe it they don't
[1:13:16] believe it
[1:13:32] let me go quickly because we will not
[1:13:34] get through everything or else who have
[1:13:36] to read the entire marriage and that
[1:13:38] voice message to you tonight
[1:13:40] brother Graham says may look at Natural
[1:13:43] Beauty it's deceiving
[1:13:48] and that's why a woman is giving
[1:13:53] that beauty
[1:13:58] amen
[1:14:00] follow the thought now
[1:14:02] looks at natural beauty
[1:14:06] is deceiving that's why the woman was
[1:14:09] giving
[1:14:10] their beauty for deception to deceive a
[1:14:14] beautiful woman if she don't use it in
[1:14:17] the right way
[1:14:18] is a curse
[1:14:22] to her
[1:14:23] that would send her to Hell quicker than
[1:14:26] anything else
[1:14:27] I know of why because there is a three
[1:14:30] sacred virtue that would be perverted
[1:14:34] that's why we sent her to hell is the
[1:14:36] misuse of the The Virtue because the
[1:14:40] reason why God gave it to you to to the
[1:14:43] woman it was because of his purpose
[1:14:48] praise the Lord
[1:14:50] for life
[1:14:51] for Redemption
[1:14:55] so the misuse of that
[1:14:58] and that's the reason why God will send
[1:15:00] any creature to hell is because of the
[1:15:03] misuse of his word
[1:15:13] man would go to hell if he misuse his
[1:15:16] authority
[1:15:17] right
[1:15:19] sir
[1:15:23] are we together
[1:15:26] I want I want you to see uh what what I
[1:15:29] wanted them I was I was hoping and
[1:15:31] praying for is for you to just see that
[1:15:34] this thing is not just it's not just a
[1:15:38] statement there that you struggle with
[1:15:40] but for you to see it from the place
[1:15:42] where it comes from the culture and it's
[1:15:44] in in the religion you know and and and
[1:15:47] just how it is
[1:15:51] the beautiful place the beautiful
[1:15:53] expression of God bringing his first
[1:15:57] daughter do you do you imagine in your
[1:16:00] mind how it breaks the Father's Heart
[1:16:05] what it is to almighty God
[1:16:13] praise the Lord
[1:16:16] when brother Brandon made their
[1:16:18] statement a chain is only strong
[1:16:21] at its week of Link
[1:16:24] praise the Lord
[1:16:25] that's what it took to break
[1:16:29] God to make him to condescend
[1:16:32] it is that expression of the woman
[1:16:43] go ahead he says yeah now notice but God
[1:16:47] is future in character
[1:16:50] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:16:53] Jesus
[1:16:54] but there's never was a character like
[1:16:58] him on the Earth
[1:17:00] and what are the three virtues
[1:17:02] surrounded character
[1:17:07] praise the Lord
[1:17:09] the inventors
[1:17:10] motherhood Womanhood what is that
[1:17:13] character
[1:17:14] that's just all a horse
[1:17:25] praise the Lord
[1:17:30] now we find out today the church
[1:17:36] the church character Satan and his group
[1:17:38] look after big beautiful churches
[1:17:40] beautiful things that's what the word
[1:17:43] looks at today all is the person and
[1:17:46] great so and so and so pray so Godly
[1:17:49] walking out and and big Robin
[1:17:52] and I don't even know why I put this yet
[1:17:54] is is not driving my touch but the real
[1:17:59] sense of God looks for the character of
[1:18:03] the Vindicated word okay now I know why
[1:18:06] I put it in
[1:18:07] yeah
[1:18:08] amen
[1:18:10] because it's it's not it's not the
[1:18:13] physical building
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:18] is now what the church has in terms of
[1:18:21] musician or our organization the world
[1:18:24] what the the real believer should be
[1:18:27] attracted to
[1:18:31] is the Vindication of God's word
[1:18:35] is God bringing his word to pass in our
[1:18:39] midst if not we have no reason being
[1:18:41] here
[1:18:43] if God is now fulfilling his word in our
[1:18:46] mess in this assembly we don't have a
[1:18:48] reason to exist
[1:18:55] that's what we must be looking for
[1:19:02] praise the Lord
[1:19:04] a pure picture of the church today that
[1:19:07] we stand by the word
[1:19:10] we know is going
[1:19:13] to be made vedicated we know it's coming
[1:19:16] into Power some days
[1:19:18] praise the Lord
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:23] how soon and yeah I'm I'm just getting
[1:19:26] down here you may ask me
[1:19:29] why did he permit her to be designed us
[1:19:33] why did God do it
[1:19:38] I don't want to take too much time
[1:19:40] because I got a lot more to say why the
[1:19:44] question
[1:19:45] might arise then why did God make
[1:19:49] this woman like this
[1:19:54] so look at now what brother Brandon is
[1:19:57] talking about here
[1:19:58] why did God make this woman like this
[1:20:02] then he said her designer is Satan
[1:20:06] can can you look at that just look at
[1:20:09] that thought
[1:20:09] and bring it back to the word sure
[1:20:18] praise the Lord
[1:20:22] are we together
[1:20:27] it's it's almost like if I want to take
[1:20:31] it into uh into the this this line of
[1:20:34] thought for you to be able to see it uh
[1:20:36] uh it's it's like uh
[1:20:39] engineering now the the designer has the
[1:20:42] thought in this mind
[1:20:44] amen
[1:20:46] he pulls everything down there on uh on
[1:20:50] on on paper
[1:20:53] and you have the people that do the
[1:20:55] building
[1:20:56] the construction and put the you know
[1:20:59] everything together now let's go ahead
[1:21:01] he says why did he permit her to be
[1:21:03] designed us
[1:21:07] why did God make this woman like this
[1:21:10] why did he permit her to be made like
[1:21:14] that
[1:21:14] it was for his own good pleasure
[1:21:21] it was for his own good pleasure
[1:21:26] praise the Lord
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:29] now you get there to to Isaiah 53 where
[1:21:33] the Bible expressed that the pleasure of
[1:21:36] the Lord
[1:21:37] will prosper in his hands
[1:21:39] wish me everything that Jesus will go
[1:21:42] through to be rejected to be beating to
[1:21:45] you know the
[1:21:46] bloody up and taking off his being and
[1:21:49] all of that all of those things will
[1:21:52] fulfill the pleasure of the Lord
[1:21:56] and God had a pleasure
[1:22:01] it was for his own good pleasure what
[1:22:03] was that pleasure
[1:22:05] that we all know the making noon of his
[1:22:07] attributes
[1:22:11] he was he just didn't want us to be
[1:22:14] limited with the knowledge that that the
[1:22:17] Angels know him for just as a holy God
[1:22:22] he wanted us of his children to know him
[1:22:25] as a savior
[1:22:26] as a deliverer as a Healer
[1:22:36] are we together now brother Brandon will
[1:22:38] says that it was for his own good
[1:22:41] pleasure sure now if you want to turn to

[1:25:21] man he will get down to talking about uh
[1:25:24] Abraham and all of that he would get you
[1:25:27] would get right into the subject of
[1:25:29] election
[1:25:30] that's where the scripture will let us
[1:25:33] know that uh you know God says I will
[1:25:37] have mercy on whom I will have mercy are
[1:25:41] we having whom are we having you know he
[1:25:44] gets right into that place where the
[1:25:46] Potter cannot say to the clay why you
[1:25:48] make me dance now so you see brother
[1:25:51] Branham is making us to understand year
[1:25:53] that it was for God's Own pleasure
[1:25:58] amen
[1:26:00] he being the great Potter
[1:26:04] praise the lord we just have to follow
[1:26:08] we have to follow to see what he wanted
[1:26:11] to achieve
[1:26:13] and a way to follow him is to is to
[1:26:16] follow his Plan of Redemption because
[1:26:19] that's where he brought everything down
[1:26:21] to him
[1:26:23] his Plan of Redemption he helped us for
[1:26:26] us to be able to see the fall in in
[1:26:30] Genesis
[1:26:32] praise the lord we can see the fall in
[1:26:35] Genesis and and we we don't become just
[1:26:38] like other uh unbelievers that we says
[1:26:41] well I mean what did the God make why
[1:26:43] did God make the devil
[1:26:45] right
[1:26:46] why did God make man to fall
[1:26:52] why because we have followed we have we
[1:26:55] have had the grace to be able to see the
[1:26:57] big picture
[1:27:04] praise the Lord
[1:27:07] and here Isaiah the prophet
[1:27:11] talking to Israel
[1:27:15] and showing Israel you being the people
[1:27:17] of God you have gone from one captivity
[1:27:20] to another captivity
[1:27:23] being the people of God that saw the
[1:27:26] hand of God that God called Our Father
[1:27:28] Abraham
[1:27:31] and yet we have gone through all of
[1:27:34] these things that we have gone through
[1:27:37] but yet he's able to say to them
[1:27:40] your maker is your husband
[1:27:43] the one that have made you the one they
[1:27:46] have designed you for you to have gone
[1:27:49] through everything that you have gone
[1:27:51] through
[1:27:53] he's the one that have drawn you to
[1:27:55] himself
[1:27:58] in the book of Hosea he's he expressed
[1:28:01] to Ezra through the prophet who's here
[1:28:04] he says I'm the one that have wounded
[1:28:07] you I will heal you
[1:28:12] you say I have wounded you I will heal
[1:28:15] you
[1:28:21] praise the Lord
[1:28:23] now so you see you have to see you have
[1:28:26] to see the big picture for you to
[1:28:28] appreciate
[1:28:33] why he gave us wounds because he's a
[1:28:36] Healer
[1:28:40] why he allowed us to go through what we
[1:28:42] we go through because he's able to make
[1:28:45] it right
[1:28:50] it's not because we are cast of or we
[1:28:53] are we are we are we as we are second
[1:28:55] grade I mean the way over the years
[1:28:58] people ride on this thing the woman uh
[1:29:01] uh uh as a byproduct
[1:29:04] now whereby Proto will just
[1:29:06] misunderstood and misuse
[1:29:08] but you know why I was driving it it was
[1:29:11] this same old devilish thought
[1:29:15] it was the same or devilish thought
[1:29:19] that the woman was not in the original
[1:29:21] creation
[1:29:22] so she's looked down
[1:29:24] she will always fail that's the reason
[1:29:27] why she was never allowed to go to
[1:29:29] school
[1:29:30] in the beginning she was always kept
[1:29:33] behind
[1:29:37] it is where that thought is coming from
[1:29:43] praise the Lord
[1:29:47] it almost sounds to me like she's
[1:29:50] Satan's child
[1:29:57] praise the Lord
[1:30:00] you know what I'm saying this is is
[1:30:01] because there are very same thoughts
[1:30:05] that have affected the society has also
[1:30:08] affected the church
[1:30:12] it's worth the same teaching that says
[1:30:14] the days of Miracle is passed
[1:30:18] praise the Lord
[1:30:20] you can never amount to God's holiness
[1:30:24] you can never live right you cannot live
[1:30:27] above sin we are all sinners
[1:30:30] is the same old thought
[1:30:33] the same way the devil Rob Eve
[1:30:37] he robbed Eve
[1:30:40] and design her mind
[1:30:44] that's where the designer was he took
[1:30:47] her mind from the purity of God's word
[1:30:49] and put it on fleshly felt
[1:31:08] right praise the Lord
[1:31:10] we we we we will never be able to rise
[1:31:13] to to the image of God or rise to the
[1:31:16] potential where God want us to be if we
[1:31:19] don't keep our eyes on the word
[1:31:22] if you keep your eyes on the flesh you
[1:31:24] will keep filling you will keep feeling
[1:31:27] praise the Lord you keep your eyes on
[1:31:29] what people says you will keep feeling
[1:31:31] you got to keep your eyes on God's word
[1:31:43] because your maker
[1:31:46] it's your bridegroom
[1:31:49] praise the Lord
[1:31:50] your maker is your bridegroom when
[1:31:52] brother Branham talks about that story
[1:31:55] about that little prince that went down
[1:31:57] there in Chicago and looking for the
[1:31:59] bride and he saw that that that girl and
[1:32:03] uh like a Cinderella story and watching
[1:32:06] beaches and going out and and then he
[1:32:08] disguised himself he hire everything to
[1:32:12] make her a princess
[1:32:15] he had what it takes to make her a
[1:32:18] princess that's the reason why he never
[1:32:20] went down looking for fine dress because
[1:32:22] he had what it takes to give her fine
[1:32:24] dress he was not looking for high he
[1:32:27] because he had what it takes to give her
[1:32:29] high heels he was not looking for you
[1:32:31] know how she did her hair because he had
[1:32:34] what it takes to make her what he want
[1:32:37] her to be
[1:32:42] praise the Lord
[1:32:45] so what was he looking for
[1:32:47] he was looking for a character that was
[1:32:50] submit to his authority a character that
[1:32:54] was submit to the world
[1:32:56] that's what God is looking for
[1:33:02] praise the Lord
[1:33:05] I hope that this is on YouTube because I
[1:33:07] know I would get in trouble for it
[1:33:11] there are people that don't like you to
[1:33:13] preach this
[1:33:14] because they think that you are
[1:33:16] feminists
[1:33:20] when you preach truth like this
[1:33:28] praise the Lord
[1:33:32] and we are the same people
[1:33:35] that are looking for Revival we are
[1:33:36] looking for the power of God
[1:33:39] and brother Branham says when the bride
[1:33:41] know who she is
[1:33:44] I want you to know who you are
[1:33:46] that you are not set on design you are
[1:33:49] not a church design you are not a man
[1:33:51] design
[1:33:52] you are almighty God designed
[1:34:02] that's by our history
[1:34:30] foreign
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:42] father Lord Jesus
[1:34:46] precious Lord
[1:34:49] sometimes we listen to the tips loading
[1:34:51] listening to the prophet
[1:34:56] of a truth Lord God sometimes
[1:34:59] brother Brandon Wright gets right down
[1:35:01] on that trail and he's grounding sin
[1:35:04] and he's dealing with thanks Lord
[1:35:09] father
[1:35:10] how many times lord the devil hover over
[1:35:13] us Lord and just make us to feel

[1:40:26] Jesse brought all of his sons and never
[1:40:28] even thought about David he never even
[1:40:31] remembered that David was his son
[1:40:34] because he was thinking about a king
[1:40:36] would be a man with muscles and a man
[1:40:39] that is all dead and a man that is he
[1:40:41] never even thought about David
[1:40:47] when God was looking at the character
[1:40:51] that has been built in the heart of that
[1:40:53] little boy because of all of his
[1:40:55] struggle being despised being rejected
[1:41:02] God put you in a situation that he put
[1:41:06] you in because he want to build a very
[1:41:08] strong character in you a character
[1:41:10] where you will ever trust God

[1:44:18] let's take our Bibles let's go to the
[1:44:21] book of Corinthians
[1:44:26] just on the news a couple of days ago
[1:44:32] because of all of the suppression
[1:44:35] First Corinthians chapter 11
[1:44:39] all the suppression over there in Iran
[1:44:42] and in Iraq or or the the Muslim world
[1:44:45] that I have in all of these things
[1:44:47] a young lady
[1:44:49] ran
[1:44:50] from her parents and went back to she
[1:44:53] went over to Turkey
[1:44:55] and she was living there then
[1:44:59] and uh
[1:45:01] trying to break away from
[1:45:04] the life of suppression that she's being
[1:45:07] honored
[1:45:10] and she
[1:45:13] uh
[1:45:15] you know
[1:45:17] parents up there was not happy with her
[1:45:22] and I think she went back home just just
[1:45:25] being a girl trying to get back home to
[1:45:28] see her parents and all of that
[1:45:31] her dad killed her
[1:45:35] and turned himself into the police
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:45] reason why the devil went after Eve
[1:45:49] even though he don't understand it
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:53] praise the Lord
[1:45:54] but you just you think about it you
[1:45:56] think about it a father
[1:45:58] you are you all are there and your
[1:46:00] father just called one of your inner
[1:46:03] room say close the door
[1:46:06] and you don't know what they talk about
[1:46:09] there is always that curious thought why
[1:46:13] Daddy call this one
[1:46:16] why
[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:20] for God to to send the entire creation
[1:46:24] to sleep
[1:46:27] to bring out Eve
[1:46:29] that makes Satan jealous he knew there
[1:46:32] was something about the woman he don't
[1:46:34] know what it was but he knew that if he
[1:46:37] can get on her
[1:46:39] there is something about the woman that
[1:46:42] God will shove the entire creation
[1:46:45] just like when when uh Joshua says
[1:46:48] stands there
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:46:56] even when we come together in few
[1:46:59] numbers we might be four or five Jesus
[1:47:03] said wherever two or three I gather in
[1:47:06] my name
[1:47:08] it's not the great numbers that make the
[1:47:10] church
[1:47:12] is there two or three that comes with
[1:47:14] determined heart to be able to pause
[1:47:17] their shoulder to the wheels to stand
[1:47:19] for God's word
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:36] you feel you follow things in the Middle
[1:47:38] East
[1:47:39] you hear the counter for abuses that is
[1:47:42] that is that is that is all out there
[1:47:44] that is happening in our way
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:53] let me not get away from my subject
[1:47:55] tonight
[1:47:57] I think I have preached enough
[1:48:01] average enough
[1:48:03] let's read our
[1:48:05] our scripture tonight First Corinthians
[1:48:08] chapter 11 verse 23.
[1:48:12] let me now get it
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:15] I mean I get into this
[1:48:18] foreign
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:50] in parents
[1:48:53] you know what they would say he said boy
[1:48:56] you get out there but when they when
[1:48:59] when there is something happening around
[1:49:01] the guild and it's like the parents
[1:49:04] guess never
[1:49:05] just and and not what Tim didn't say
[1:49:14] the boy can go out and fool around and
[1:49:16] and become stupid and that was part of
[1:49:19] the family name
[1:49:22] when a girl goes around and and she goes
[1:49:25] and do something or maybe get pregnant
[1:49:27] it brings a big blame on the family why
[1:49:30] because there is something in a woman
[1:49:32] that reflects
[1:49:35] she's made with a nature that reflects
[1:49:41] brother Branham says our attitude brings
[1:49:43] a reflection it tells people whether we
[1:49:46] are Christian or not there is just
[1:49:48] something about the female attitude that
[1:49:51] reflects
[1:49:54] you can dress you wear the necktie and
[1:49:57] everything and and uh you know you dress
[1:50:00] smart and people would just says well
[1:50:02] are you working in the bank
[1:50:04] but when a woman dressed decent what is
[1:50:07] it she's a Christian
[1:50:13] it's one of those those holy Holiness
[1:50:16] people
[1:50:18] that's the first thing they throw on her
[1:50:20] is one of those Holiness people I think
[1:50:22] she's a Christian
[1:50:25] praise the Lord why because God placed
[1:50:28] in your nature
[1:50:30] flesh
[1:50:34] okay
[1:50:38] okay
[1:50:43] let's read verse 24
[1:50:47] verse 23 for I for I receive of the Lord
[1:50:50] that which also I deliver unto you that
[1:50:54] the Lord Jesus Christ the same night in
[1:50:56] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:50:58] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:51:01] and said take it
[1:51:03] this is my body
[1:51:05] which is broken for you
[1:51:09] this dude in remembrance of me after the
[1:51:13] same manner also he took the cup
[1:51:16] when he have stopped saying
[1:51:19] this cup
[1:51:20] is the New Testament in my blood
[1:51:24] this
[1:51:25] as of as ye drink it in remembrance of
[1:51:29] me
[1:51:30] for us often as yet eat this bread and
[1:51:34] drink this cup it do show the Lord's
[1:51:36] death till he come
[1:51:39] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:51:42] and drink this cup of the Lord on
[1:51:45] watering shall be guilty of the body and
[1:51:48] the blood of the Lord
[1:51:51] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:51:54] him eat of this bread and drink
[1:51:57] of this cup
[1:52:00] for he that eat it and drinketh on Walt
[1:52:02] till it eat it and drink a damnation to
[1:52:05] himself
[1:52:06] not Discerning the Lord's body
