[48:58] Praise the Lord keeping them in in in in
[49:02] everything that is happening around the
[49:04] world around the country Revelation
[49:06] chapter 5 we read from verse one tonight
[49:09] and I
[49:10] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[49:14] the throne a book written
[49:17] within and on the back side seal with
[49:20] Seven
[49:22] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[49:25] proclaiming with a loud Voice who is
[49:29] worthy to open the
[49:31] book and to lose the seals
[49:37] thereof and no man praise the Lord sorry
[49:42] and no
[49:44] man in heaven none in Earth neither
[49:49] under the Earth was able to open the
[49:52] book neither to look there on
[49:57] and I wept much because no man was found
[50:01] Wy to open and to read the book needed
[50:06] to look there on now you I want us to
[50:09] pay attention to that no
[50:13] man verse five and one of the others
[50:17] said unto me weep that Behold The Lion
[50:20] of the Trap of
[50:22] Judah the root of David have prevailed
[50:28] to open the book and to lose the Seven
[50:31] Seals
[50:32] thereof
[50:35] amen and I beheld and low in the midst
[50:39] of the
[50:40] throne and all the four beasts and in
[50:44] the midst of the other stood a
[50:48] lamb as it have been
[50:51] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[50:56] which which are the seven spirits of God
[51:00] sent forth into all the
[51:03] Earth and he came and took the book out
[51:06] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[51:10] the throne and when he had taken the
[51:13] book now this is where where uh I got it
[51:17] really caught me when he have taken the
[51:21] book The Four
[51:23] beasts and and four and two 20 others
[51:28] fell down before the lamb having every
[51:32] one of them
[51:35] HS and golden VES for of others which
[51:39] are the prayers of the
[51:43] Saints praise the
[51:47] Lord the Lord bless you you may have
[51:49] your seat when I read
[51:53] this the other
[51:55] time I I read it again it caught my
[51:59] attention like I said to realize that
[52:03] when he have taken the book when he took
[52:05] the book The sealed
[52:08] book praise the
[52:12] Lord the Bible says the four beasts and
[52:15] the 24 athers they fell down before the
[52:20] lamb but they were having in their hand
[52:24] HS praise the Lord which is an
[52:28] instrument and they were also having
[52:34] VES I I I thought I was going to bring
[52:37] one but that's it's not they were having
[52:40] vowes also that were
[52:43] F of
[52:47] incense and and and and what actually
[52:50] was in the vows were the
[52:52] prayers of the Saints
[52:56] praise the
[52:57] Lord
[52:59] amen at the opening of the
[53:05] seals we get to see and
[53:08] understand what has become of our
[53:13] prayers praise the
[53:16] Lord and I think that is something that
[53:19] this last days
[53:23] church is losing the reality
[53:27] of what it is with all the the you know
[53:32] the the gadgets that we have and and and
[53:37] I mean we we our age is such a busy fast
[53:41] moving age that we really don't have
[53:44] time to
[53:46] pray praise the
[53:49] Lord that we really don't have time to
[53:54] pray but I thought about this and I've
[53:57] been I just been looking through the
[54:00] word I've been looking through the
[54:01] message I I've been say been looking and
[54:04] saying you know what you know I want
[54:06] brother BR wanted to see what brother
[54:08] brandham said on this you know the the
[54:11] the prayers of the saints that are
[54:14] gathered in this vow in the Old
[54:16] Testament there in the book of Psalm uh
[54:19] uh David told us our tears I gather in
[54:21] the bottle he said God gather my tears
[54:25] in the bottle
[54:27] a bottle of
[54:29] remembrance and here and year that John
[54:32] is
[54:33] seeing when the book came open he seing
[54:37] our prayers in the vce and and and uh
[54:41] what actually it is is in this vow of
[54:45] incense that blow in the face of
[54:49] God praise the
[54:52] Lord if we know how important this
[54:57] is we will have a prayer life like never
[55:01] before if we know
[55:04] how important and Powerful this is you
[55:08] will never come to church without a
[55:10] prayer request because you always have
[55:13] something to pray about you always have
[55:16] somebody to pray about praise the
[55:19] Lord
[55:22] amen glory be to God
[55:26] but just like I I said our age is such a
[55:29] busy and fast moving age that I mean we
[55:32] want to do everything on the on the you
[55:35] know on the cell phone we want to do
[55:37] everything on the uh uh you know on the
[55:40] cell phone you know uh we send our
[55:42] prayer needs and this is uh you know uh
[55:45] Lord please help our brother we we send
[55:47] God a text message God please help our
[55:50] brother Lord we praying for our sister
[55:52] and and and sometimes that's all
[55:56] praise the Lord it it's not wrong don't
[55:59] don't don't think that I'm bashing
[56:01] against that it's not wrong but if that
[56:03] is just all your
[56:05] prayer you are worse than a
[56:10] Catholic praise the
[56:13] Lord amen if that's just all your prayer
[56:17] by sending those uh few messages and
[56:20] says Lord bless our brother Lord and
[56:23] yeah we yeah then then I mean that's
[56:26] that's ugly I believe that is uh is uh
[56:31] uh a medium by which we can encourage
[56:33] someone that we are praying for them and
[56:36] actually go back and really pray for
[56:38] them praise the
[56:44] Lord but tonight I will I will start and
[56:47] then I will before I go into what I want
[56:49] to say as I always don't have
[56:54] time I want to go back uh a little bit
[56:58] on uh on on on Sunday for some reason
[57:01] after the service Sunday I was so tired
[57:04] my goodness I don't know what it was but
[57:07] uh uh I just felt like uh
[57:13] uh I just felt like we had a good
[57:15] service
[57:17] amen good service will make you
[57:21] tired praise the Lord
[57:27] good service will make you tired but
[57:29] what while we were we were speaking on
[57:31] on on
[57:33] Sunday uh there were there were there
[57:36] were thoughts that that i' I've never
[57:38] thought about and uh you know and it was
[57:42] almost like they just came right to me
[57:44] right behind the pullit
[57:46] here and uh and and they were beautiful
[57:49] because they were now part of my NS what
[57:52] the thought was is that uh there was a
[57:55] period of time where
[57:56] I took the four beasts which is the four
[57:59] living creatures the four
[58:01] anointing and I was talking about the
[58:04] the the dove coming on the lamb praise
[58:08] the Lord amen that was what we saw at
[58:12] the River Jordan praise the Lord amen we
[58:16] saw the dove returning on the lamb at
[58:19] the river jording which is the Holy
[58:22] Ghost and then we spoke also of the do
[58:27] leading the
[58:30] lion which of course it had to be the
[58:33] Holy Ghost leading the first three
[58:35] Church
[58:36] ages because the first three Church Ages
[58:39] was under the anointing of the
[58:43] lion are we
[58:45] together and and
[58:48] actually uh uh I think I think the
[58:51] thought came or the inspiration came
[58:54] because I had in my not were you know
[58:57] brother bam talk about the do leading
[58:58] the eagle and but he said that on the
[59:02] wings of a snow white do and uh uh uh
[59:06] you know relating that to his healing
[59:08] and relating to what was happening at
[59:10] that period of time but as as we were
[59:13] talking on that and I talk about the
[59:16] dove Leading The Lion and the dove uh
[59:18] leading the ox you know it was the do uh
[59:22] H or the lamb nature in the ARX you know
[59:26] that uh the had the Saints during the
[59:28] time of the persecution for them to be
[59:31] able to you know bear persecution you
[59:34] know uh uh uh give their body to be
[59:37] burned go to prison and all the things
[59:39] that they had to go through and the do
[59:41] leading the you know the the the man uh
[59:45] uh on the the next uh uh uh uh
[59:50] uh Three Ages now so the first three
[59:54] ages the first three three Church Ages
[59:57] was honor the Lion's anointing that was
[1:00:01] where the great missionary work was done
[1:00:06] praise the Lord amen now what I want us
[1:00:09] to understand and learn from these
[1:00:12] living creatures is that uh that that is
[1:00:18] that's the anointing that God used to
[1:00:20] influence his church in every
[1:00:23] age praise the Lord amen he used that to
[1:00:28] influence because the church can do
[1:00:31] nothing but just respond to the
[1:00:34] anointing of their
[1:00:38] age praise the Lord amen until God comes
[1:00:43] and anoint us with his Spirit we will
[1:00:47] just be having a form of
[1:00:51] organization amen trying to make the
[1:00:54] church okay let's do this so the church
[1:00:56] can be better let's do this so the
[1:00:58] church can be better we will just come
[1:00:59] up with all of those ideas at the end we
[1:01:01] will fuss and everybody will go their
[1:01:06] way but until God anoint that's the
[1:01:09] reason why Jesus told the disciple to
[1:01:12] wait for the holy ghost in the upper
[1:01:14] room
[1:01:15] amen T until you are Inu with
[1:01:20] power power from on high so when that
[1:01:23] anointing comes that's what makes the
[1:01:26] church to go into what we are supposed
[1:01:29] to
[1:01:30] do praise the Lord are we together amen
[1:01:36] now so uh
[1:01:38] uh you know I I was thinking about
[1:01:41] that but then I thought that I will I
[1:01:44] will I will look at it through the
[1:01:46] opening of the seals I will look at it
[1:01:48] at Revelation chapter 5 so that's what I
[1:01:51] want to do tonight by the help of God
[1:01:54] now so when you look in Revelation
[1:01:56] chapter 5 as we have just read you will
[1:01:59] realize that
[1:02:06] uh the scripture is talking about the
[1:02:08] open the the opening of the seals I'm
[1:02:10] not going into the seals I just want to
[1:02:13] deal with things around it so so you can
[1:02:15] be able to grab the picture here now the
[1:02:19] Bible speaks of uh uh the strong Angel
[1:02:23] there in verse two that Proclaim with a
[1:02:26] loud voice who is wed to open the book
[1:02:30] and to loose the seals thereof now this
[1:02:34] book is the book of redemption like we
[1:02:37] all know this book is is the is is the
[1:02:42] ttle day amen it's the it's the book of
[1:02:47] life it's the book from where Adam was
[1:02:52] operating from in the beginning
[1:02:57] praise the Lord amen when we really get
[1:03:00] down to study the the the the the book
[1:03:03] of redemption and the opening of the
[1:03:05] seals you will realize that it's more
[1:03:08] than just a literal
[1:03:12] book okay now so this book Adam
[1:03:19] fulfilled the
[1:03:22] book amen it was the book that was
[1:03:25] giving him the the the power and
[1:03:28] authority for him to name the animal and
[1:03:31] God will be pleased it was the book that
[1:03:34] was giving him the Authority for him to
[1:03:36] control nature yes praise the Lord but
[1:03:40] when he listened to the devil
[1:03:43] Li the book The Authority the
[1:03:47] anointing you can call it whichever one
[1:03:50] is stay the same went back in the hands
[1:03:53] of the original owner it went back in
[1:03:56] the hands of
[1:03:59] God praise the Lord amen so in every age
[1:04:05] God will now have to deal with a
[1:04:10] man God will have to call a man into a
[1:04:14] life of
[1:04:16] Separation to be able to give him a
[1:04:20] portion of anointing for his
[1:04:22] age praise the Lord God called Noah a
[1:04:26] preacher of righteousness he was a
[1:04:29] farmer but from that book Noah was able
[1:04:32] to build an ark that was that that could
[1:04:36] survive the
[1:04:38] Judgment under that anointing Noah was
[1:04:41] able to bring all of those animals of
[1:04:43] different
[1:04:45] nature and keep them
[1:04:48] together praise the Lord he was
[1:04:51] operating from The Book of Life he was
[1:04:54] operating from from the title day a
[1:04:58] portion of anointing was given to him
[1:05:00] for that work Abraham had his shield and
[1:05:03] and and down Through the
[1:05:06] Ages praise the Lord but yes the book
[1:05:09] here returning back and now that's
[1:05:11] that's where I want us to to to be able
[1:05:13] to look at
[1:05:15] tonight and and there is no man
[1:05:19] worthy to take the book to even look
[1:05:22] upon it no man who is wor say to open
[1:05:27] the book and to lose the seals thereof
[1:05:29] verse three says no man in heaven none
[1:05:33] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:05:35] able to open the book neither to to to
[1:05:39] look there on John said he weep because
[1:05:43] no man was
[1:05:45] worthy the reason why I say we should
[1:05:48] pay attention to man is because when God
[1:05:53] created everything in the beginning
[1:05:56] Genesis chapter 1 it was man that God
[1:06:00] created in His
[1:06:02] image praise the Lord amen so man from
[1:06:07] the very beginning from the mind of God
[1:06:11] the that God Tau about a man was for a
[1:06:15] man to be his agent
[1:06:19] yes praise the Lord the thought of God
[1:06:22] for man because God is a
[1:06:26] spirit
[1:06:28] amen and for God to make his known his
[1:06:32] thought about a man is that the man will
[1:06:35] be the vehicle that he would drop
[1:06:40] in Praise the
[1:06:42] Lord the man will be the body that the
[1:06:46] spirit God will come and D
[1:06:49] in that was God's original thought for
[1:06:54] Us Praise the
[1:06:56] Lord his thought was to dwell in
[1:07:02] us and that's why he made us in His
[1:07:06] image and not for us to have our own
[1:07:09] life and struggle by ourself but his
[1:07:12] thought was to dwell in
[1:07:15] us that we will be his
[1:07:19] agent praise the Lord that if he want to
[1:07:23] make contact with the rest of his
[1:07:25] creation he will use
[1:07:27] man he will speak to man or he will send
[1:07:31] a man or he will Empower a
[1:07:35] man praise the
[1:07:37] Lord that was God's
[1:07:40] thought now so uh uh let's let's just
[1:07:44] read something
[1:07:48] here it will help us to to get our TOS
[1:07:51] together tonight God in his people if I
[1:07:55] said to you that I was I was born of the
[1:07:59] spirit of God and the spirit of Jesus
[1:08:01] Christ was in
[1:08:03] me you did expect me to do what he
[1:08:08] did I like he did and his Spirit working
[1:08:12] through a human being pay attention now
[1:08:15] do you believe that his Spirit work on a
[1:08:20] h h a bride seing one time do you
[1:08:23] believe that and on the pool of
[1:08:27] beesa the water chopped up in another in
[1:08:32] another sense there was current in the
[1:08:34] water amen the pool of beest that the
[1:08:38] water chop or trouble water ever who
[1:08:42] step in there
[1:08:44] believing they receive their healing is
[1:08:48] that
[1:08:49] right Co the water say look what a great
[1:08:54] water I am could the water say that no
[1:08:58] because it was not the water it was God
[1:09:02] coming on the water the same God that
[1:09:05] walk on the water in the beginning he
[1:09:07] was now coming on the water just shaking
[1:09:09] the
[1:09:10] water are we
[1:09:18] together it was the angel on the water
[1:09:21] that done the healing not the water
[1:09:25] there
[1:09:25] Angel when the angel went away it was
[1:09:31] just
[1:09:32] water praise the Lord it was the angel
[1:09:36] on the Brazen serpent that was doing the
[1:09:39] healing when the angel went away it was
[1:09:43] just brazing
[1:09:44] stepping that's the reason why when the
[1:09:47] people started worshiping it Hezekiah
[1:09:49] had to destroy it because it it became
[1:09:52] an
[1:09:53] idol if God is not in is an
[1:09:56] idol praise the Lord are we together are
[1:10:00] we together
[1:10:04] amen when the angel went away it was
[1:10:08] just a water men are just
[1:10:13] men men are just
[1:10:16] men speaking in a generous sense Hans
[1:10:20] are just
[1:10:22] Hans it's not talking mostly about men
[1:10:24] as a gender but humans are just humans
[1:10:28] men are just
[1:10:30] men but it's God's
[1:10:35] agency going back to God's
[1:10:38] purpose praise the Lord going back to
[1:10:41] his purpose to always use man to do
[1:10:46] something amen use a man to preach use a
[1:10:50] man to play music use a man also to
[1:10:53] listen to his word
[1:10:58] but we have to remember that
[1:11:01] men are just
[1:11:04] men God
[1:11:06] doesn't fall upon
[1:11:09] denomination he just don't fall upon an
[1:11:12] empty
[1:11:13] building praise the Lord
[1:11:17] amen we try to do the best you know uh
[1:11:20] to keep you know uh uh this place decent
[1:11:23] clean uh it's in one sense it is for our
[1:11:26] own good it's for our own health amen we
[1:11:29] don't want to come in a nasty place we
[1:11:31] get
[1:11:32] sick praise the
[1:11:35] Lord but you see it is not when we say
[1:11:38] the house of God as if to say that's
[1:11:40] where God live we come into his house
[1:11:43] when we leave we leave him in his house
[1:11:45] and we go to our house
[1:11:47] no he don't fall upon the building he
[1:11:49] fall upon
[1:11:52] humans praise the Lord so is the
[1:11:55] atmosphere that we create the Praises
[1:11:58] that we give to him we lift our hands we
[1:12:00] sing that's what brings him closer it's
[1:12:03] not the building it's not the
[1:12:07] mountain it's not the water it's not the
[1:12:09] Brazen
[1:12:12] sepin are we
[1:12:15] together God thus inold upon
[1:12:17] denomination God does inold upon
[1:12:20] mechanical
[1:12:22] divines praise the Lord
[1:12:27] amen it's not it's not the building and
[1:12:30] I will even say it it's not the tip that
[1:12:33] you listening to let me tell you what is
[1:12:35] what is real praise the Lord amen it's
[1:12:40] not the tape that's the reason why press
[1:12:42] play will not
[1:12:44] work God needs a man he needs you your
[1:12:49] faith to want to hear from God sir it is
[1:12:54] your faith and your desire that you want
[1:12:57] to hear from
[1:13:03] God praise the
[1:13:07] Lord it is your
[1:13:09] faith and your
[1:13:12] desire it is God coming to honor your
[1:13:19] faith praise the
[1:13:21] Lord are we together so God don't fall
[1:13:24] on my mechanical
[1:13:26] device God the Holy Spirit falls upon
[1:13:30] men God falls upon
[1:13:34] Hans he come and anoint Hons he anoint
[1:13:39] the desire that is in our
[1:13:42] heart praise the Lord
[1:13:46] amen are we
[1:13:49] together glory be to
[1:13:53] God it do for F upon mechanical device
[1:13:56] God the Holy Spirit fought upon men men
[1:13:59] are God
[1:14:02] agents and the hardest thing that God
[1:14:05] has ever had to do was to get one m to
[1:14:10] believe another that's another part of
[1:14:14] Faith praise the Lord amen that's
[1:14:18] another part of it but we want to
[1:14:21] establish the fact that man was God's
[1:14:26] aging are we
[1:14:28] together glory be to God you know when
[1:14:32] you read Malachi
[1:14:35] 4 if uh if uh if uh I uh uh folks back
[1:14:41] there can just put Malachi 4 for us we
[1:14:43] love that Malachi 4 behold I sent you
[1:14:47] Elijah I was thinking about that the
[1:14:49] other day I say uh if God can just help
[1:14:52] us to see what a beautiful promise this
[1:14:56] is amen the promise is behold I
[1:15:02] God send
[1:15:04] you praise the Lord yes sir if you
[1:15:07] realize in that
[1:15:10] prophecy amen if you realize in that
[1:15:13] prophecy the three person that is spoke
[1:15:16] about Elijah is
[1:15:21] last behold I God send
[1:15:26] you Elijah so you see the ministry of
[1:15:30] Elijah is to push you to God it's not to
[1:15:34] get between you and God no the ministry
[1:15:38] of Elijah is to push
[1:15:44] you praise the Lord is to expose you to
[1:15:48] God is to it's so it's to make you to
[1:15:50] get in contact with God he the
[1:15:53] ministrator is not to be God to
[1:15:59] you are we
[1:16:02] together praise the
[1:16:12] Lord now so man has always been God's
[1:16:18] Agent Man has always been God's
[1:16:22] agent because God do not fall on
[1:16:25] building neither do he fall on
[1:16:26] mechanical device the Holy Spirit falls
[1:16:29] upon men are we together let's read the
[1:16:33] next
[1:16:34] one our next
[1:16:38] uh
[1:16:40] yeah God has a hard time trying to get
[1:16:44] somebody that he can deal
[1:16:47] with that will stay humbl now you see in
[1:16:51] in in the first quote we read brother
[1:16:54] brandham say
[1:16:55] uh the harder thing that God have is to
[1:16:58] have one Mort to believe in another
[1:17:02] praise the Lord
[1:17:05] amen that is the hardest thing
[1:17:08] because we we we are all failures if God
[1:17:12] don't help us we are all
[1:17:15] failures amen but then let's read the
[1:17:17] next one and this one we establish or
[1:17:20] why why is that God has a hard time
[1:17:24] trying to get somebody that he can deal
[1:17:27] with that will stay humble and
[1:17:29] meek and stay in the place until God
[1:17:33] call him to do something you believe
[1:17:35] that a man that God can bless and he
[1:17:39] will still keep himself a man and not
[1:17:42] make himself an angel or God now you see
[1:17:46] because that is the thing that makes it
[1:17:48] difficult for one m to believe in
[1:17:50] another M because God himself have a
[1:17:53] hard time
[1:17:56] to keep us
[1:17:58] humble praise the Lord when he starts to
[1:18:01] bless us and nourage us a little bit
[1:18:04] give us a little understanding of his
[1:18:06] word and wisdom pretty soon we we start
[1:18:09] to be
[1:18:13] smart praise the Lord he has a hard time
[1:18:17] a man that he will bless and for that
[1:18:20] man to remain a
[1:18:22] man pretty soon he exalted himself above
[1:18:25] the people he either an angel or he's
[1:18:28] God to
[1:18:29] them as soon as a man gets bless and has
[1:18:34] a little something given to him he want
[1:18:37] to become
[1:18:38] God he want to become an angel he want
[1:18:42] to become some great
[1:18:47] person mean
[1:18:49] mine that's the wrong attitude God is
[1:18:53] haunting for somebody who he could bless
[1:18:57] and pour out his Blessing and the more
[1:19:00] he bless the
[1:19:03] little the man will
[1:19:07] be praise the
[1:19:10] lord it's not in our falling
[1:19:13] flesh praise the Lord this this flesh is
[1:19:17] not what is in this flesh is
[1:19:21] yeast it just need a little Heat it
[1:19:24] start to puff
[1:19:28] up it just need a little heat it starts
[1:19:33] to
[1:19:36] swe praise the Lord why because men fell
[1:19:41] from he lost the
[1:19:45] title that was the thing that
[1:19:49] kept Adam humble
[1:19:55] it was the
[1:19:57] T it was the life of
[1:20:00] God it was the anointing in whichever
[1:20:04] way we want to look at it
[1:20:07] tonight that's the reason why no man was
[1:20:12] worthy to take the book because now we
[1:20:15] are all
[1:20:19] affected by a blood of the
[1:20:22] serpent we are all affected by the cross
[1:20:25] breeding of the serpent in
[1:20:32] Eve praise the
[1:20:36] Lord he tried a Noah and at the end he
[1:20:39] got
[1:20:43] drunk praise the
[1:20:47] Lord he tried at
[1:20:53] Abraham and he told the
[1:20:56] LIE he tried
[1:20:59] Moses because of that cross breeding
[1:21:02] that's the reason why no man was watered
[1:21:05] but you see the thing there is that not
[1:21:08] only in the sense of no man was wanted
[1:21:11] to take the book but the book was for
[1:21:18] man are we together now another thing I
[1:21:22] want for us to see in Revelation chapter
[1:21:24] 5
[1:21:25] is
[1:21:26] this the Bible says no
[1:21:30] man the Bible also speak and
[1:21:34] says uh
[1:21:39] uh the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:21:44] prevailed to take the
[1:21:48] book
[1:21:52] amen and when John Lo to see the lion he
[1:21:55] saw a lamb now I'm coming back to to
[1:22:00] Sunday just the same as no man was
[1:22:04] wanted to take the book that is the same
[1:22:08] as there was
[1:22:12] no because what what I what I want us to
[1:22:16] grab what I want us to grab I'm I'm kind
[1:22:18] of for trying to bring to you tonight is
[1:22:23] that the reason why no man was wanted to
[1:22:26] take the
[1:22:28] book is
[1:22:31] because he lost the T praise the
[1:22:36] Lord is
[1:22:40] because there was something that he
[1:22:44] needed and like I said on uh on Sunday
[1:22:48] onor every
[1:22:50] age when God de with the Believers in
[1:22:53] the first three Church ages he kept them
[1:22:55] under the Lion's anointing but yet they
[1:22:59] were under the Lion's anointing that was
[1:23:01] the anointing of the age but what they
[1:23:05] needed for the do to come upon the lion
[1:23:08] was the lamb
[1:23:11] nature praise the Lord amen so if we
[1:23:15] want to take it in an for for an example
[1:23:18] all the animals in the in the AR was all
[1:23:22] under the lamb nature now uh uh not not
[1:23:25] the physical lamb but the Lamb of God
[1:23:27] that takes away the sin of the
[1:23:29] world are we together it was that lamb
[1:23:33] nature so just as the same as no man was
[1:23:36] wed to take the bug we can say no lion
[1:23:39] was wed to take the B we can say no Ox
[1:23:42] was wored to take the B what am I
[1:23:44] talking about when I says that I'm I'm
[1:23:46] referring to the
[1:23:49] anointing in the sense that no matter
[1:23:52] what age a man was was honor for him to
[1:23:55] bring Christ to the people he needed to
[1:23:59] be onor the line he needed to have the
[1:24:02] lamb
[1:24:04] nature praise the Lord and and and
[1:24:08] that's where that's where the H uh our
[1:24:11] struggle is because you find uh uh uh
[1:24:14] you know people they can they can they
[1:24:16] can be able to run through the stript
[1:24:18] they can run through the the cult and
[1:24:21] tell you you know the Bible says that or
[1:24:23] the prophet says this but when it comes
[1:24:25] to that Lin
[1:24:28] nature just like brother Bram says here
[1:24:31] a man that God will bless and he will
[1:24:34] remain
[1:24:35] humble praise the
[1:24:40] Lord when it comes to that Ling
[1:24:44] nature that was what no man was
[1:24:47] walking because we will not take the b
[1:24:50] in our in our falling state
[1:24:54] but yet you will realize that the lamb
[1:24:57] that prevailed to take the
[1:25:00] book also became a
[1:25:03] man praise the
[1:25:06] Lord and that's where the king's
[1:25:09] man Redeemer comes in he had to be a
[1:25:14] Kingsman praise the Lord he had to be
[1:25:18] nearer to us so he had to take on
[1:25:20] existing element
[1:25:22] body it had to be God himself coming and
[1:25:26] dwelling in that
[1:25:28] body praise the Lord and that's the
[1:25:31] reason why when Paul would teach in the
[1:25:34] book of Corinthian he says let me show
[1:25:36] you the most excellent way you can
[1:25:38] desire gift and want to do something for
[1:25:41] the Lord but he says let me show you the
[1:25:44] excellent way to do it the first thing
[1:25:46] that you need to get is to get a lamin
[1:25:49] nature and let the dove comes in which
[1:25:52] is charity
[1:25:55] praise the Lord amen because no matter
[1:25:59] how anointing you can be no matter how
[1:26:01] you can be able to grab people and you
[1:26:03] can drive them you can bring them to the
[1:26:07] altar if that Ling nature is not there
[1:26:09] you're not getting the people to
[1:26:12] Christ praise the Lord you are not
[1:26:15] getting them to
[1:26:17] Christ you are just getting them uh uh
[1:26:21] religious you are giving them lot of
[1:26:23] information
[1:26:25] and not getting them to
[1:26:30] Christ praise the
[1:26:33] Lord are we
[1:26:37] together that's what wrong God is
[1:26:40] haunting for the man for
[1:26:43] somebody who he could bless and pour out
[1:26:45] his Blessing and the more he blessed the
[1:26:47] little the man will become and you will
[1:26:51] never get more of God until you become
[1:26:54] new
[1:26:57] nothing praise the
[1:27:00] lord we all want to do something for God
[1:27:03] Amen we all want for God to use us in a
[1:27:07] mighty way but the Way Up Is
[1:27:10] Down
[1:27:13] amen you have got to belittle
[1:27:16] yourself he that exalt himself God will
[1:27:20] abase he that will humble himself God
[1:27:23] will exalt
[1:27:24] you have got to get little before you
[1:27:27] can get
[1:27:30] big praise the Lord and you will never
[1:27:34] be big in yourself in your own
[1:27:39] self are we together are you seeing the
[1:27:43] comparison amen because you see uh uh uh
[1:27:47] uh uh it kind of for helps because uh
[1:27:50] you look at the life of Paul and you
[1:27:52] look at the life of uh you know the
[1:27:54] apostles through the age you realize
[1:27:57] that these men were not working on their
[1:27:59] own it was their
[1:28:04] anointing and every age can only respond
[1:28:08] to the anointing of their
[1:28:12] age are we together glory to God so that
[1:28:16] just uh uh
[1:28:19] uh
[1:28:21] uh something that came to me on Sunday
[1:28:24] that I wanted to share with you now
[1:28:26] let's just get into what we want we want
[1:28:28] to talk about tonight the golden vers uh
[1:28:31] uh uh that that that hold the the
[1:28:35] prayers of the Saints let me let me
[1:28:37] share this with you from the message
[1:28:41] Bridge brother Bram
[1:28:46] said he said tonight he's a
[1:28:50] mediator but he's coming today
[1:28:55] watch and when he and when he have taken
[1:28:58] the book The the four beasts and the
[1:29:01] four and and 20 ERS fell down before him
[1:29:05] having every one of them halfs and
[1:29:07] golden vows full of others which are the
[1:29:10] prayers of the saints that those that's
[1:29:14] under the
[1:29:15] altar that have prayed for a long
[1:29:20] time they have prayed for Redemption
[1:29:24] pray for
[1:29:27] resurrection and yeah these others are
[1:29:30] are are pouring out the prayers before c
[1:29:35] now we have got a
[1:29:40] representative we got a Kingsman in
[1:29:43] heaven that comes forth to make a claim
[1:29:48] praise the Lord now you have to realize
[1:29:52] now the lamb has just come come to take
[1:29:54] the book amen and the reason why he came
[1:29:58] to take the book is to make a claim and
[1:30:02] what is he making claim
[1:30:05] on he making claim on what has been
[1:30:09] requested so you see the connection that
[1:30:11] brother brandham is making with the
[1:30:14] prayers of the Saints and the taking of
[1:30:17] the
[1:30:19] book Paul says the same thing in Hebrew
[1:30:22] he's the high priest of our
[1:30:25] confession praise the Lord he makes
[1:30:29] claim on what we
[1:30:33] confess are we together so you see the
[1:30:36] comparison that he's making he's saying
[1:30:39] now we have a
[1:30:41] representative we have a
[1:30:43] Kingsman because all of these old all of
[1:30:47] the Old Testament sins they have been
[1:30:49] praying for Redemption they have been
[1:30:51] praying for Resurrection they have been
[1:30:53] all the pray prayers that they have been
[1:30:55] now we have a Kingsman on the throne
[1:30:58] praise the lord we have one that could
[1:31:01] be touched by the feelings of our
[1:31:03] infirmities we have one that came and he
[1:31:06] was born of a woman he came right from
[1:31:09] the womb he went down to the Grave he
[1:31:12] knows every pain that we feel he knows
[1:31:14] every emotion we share in our body now
[1:31:17] he's on the throne he can represent us
[1:31:27] praise the Lord praise the Lord if we
[1:31:30] realize that if that is a revelation to
[1:31:33] us oh then the song will make more
[1:31:36] meaning I must tell Jesus all of my
[1:31:39] trials what a friend we have in Jesus
[1:31:42] will make more a sense to
[1:31:47] us are we together let's look at another
[1:31:50] one again
[1:31:57] in the bridge he also face the very same
[1:31:59] message he says listen what a jubilee
[1:32:03] going
[1:32:04] on when they seen the lamb come and take
[1:32:07] the book of
[1:32:09] redemption the soul stream
[1:32:13] out we will get it all
[1:32:17] everything the others fell down they
[1:32:21] pour out the prayers of the Saints what
[1:32:24] but they was
[1:32:28] represented a Kingsman For
[1:32:31] Us Praise the
[1:32:33] Lord
[1:32:35] amen so uh uh I mean you you you hear
[1:32:39] this thing we you know you hear this
[1:32:41] thing uh uh uh all your prayers is just
[1:32:44] touching the ceiling and just coming
[1:32:47] down you know all of those things were
[1:32:49] said during the the fire and brimstone
[1:32:52] days because because it was all like we
[1:32:55] we we have to rock the church we we have
[1:32:57] to push the benches we have to we have
[1:32:59] to I mean we got to sweat it
[1:33:03] out praise the Lord maybe the time that
[1:33:06] we did not had one on the throne maybe
[1:33:09] the time we didn't had a
[1:33:12] Kingsman praise the Lord but the Bible
[1:33:16] says he can be
[1:33:18] touched by the feelings of our
[1:33:22] infirmities praise the Lord it means
[1:33:25] that when when when we when you are
[1:33:27] going through something and you are
[1:33:30] right in that moment praise the Lord if
[1:33:34] you turn it up to him he can relate to
[1:33:37] it he can connect to it he can
[1:33:44] henage praise the Lord
[1:33:57] in the first HEBs he also says this I'll
[1:33:59] read few of them and then we will close
[1:34:01] toight is almost
[1:34:03] 9:00 he says notice notice
[1:34:06] now now if there's no
[1:34:09] alter of sacrifice in
[1:34:13] heaven where is the sacrifice for sin
[1:34:19] laying
[1:34:20] them praise the Lord the L L there has
[1:34:25] to be a place
[1:34:27] where that sling lamb bloody is laying
[1:34:32] there where the blood is now the
[1:34:36] incense was the other the other stuff
[1:34:41] that they
[1:34:43] burn which the Bible says was the
[1:34:46] prayers of the Saints if there isn't No
[1:34:50] sacrifice on the altar then the pray
[1:34:53] prayers cannot be received now here
[1:34:57] another
[1:35:01] connection the other says who's wanted
[1:35:04] to take the book another one says the
[1:35:08] lion of the Trap of Judah has
[1:35:10] prevailed
[1:35:13] amen but when John
[1:35:15] turned to look for the lion he saw a
[1:35:20] lamb and the Bible said in was a bloody
[1:35:27] lamb being a bloody lamb shows that
[1:35:30] there was an UT for the lamb to be
[1:35:35] killed praise the
[1:35:37] Lord is the picture coming to
[1:35:41] together
[1:35:44] amen because you see that is the reason
[1:35:47] why like like uh H uh Genesis there the
[1:35:51] Bible says the blood of ab CED out of
[1:35:54] the earth to God when God will come down
[1:35:57] and reconcile Adam back into Fellowship
[1:36:00] he had to come with a bleeding
[1:36:03] line
[1:36:05] amen the Bible says there in
[1:36:09] Hebrew with our blood there is no
[1:36:12] remission of sins it's almost like with
[1:36:15] our blood there is no Fellowship that is
[1:36:17] the reason why even the Jews they cannot
[1:36:20] they cannot be able to have their
[1:36:23] worship because they don't have their
[1:36:28] sacrifice are we together praise the
[1:36:31] Lord but here we have a
[1:36:35] lamb a bleeding lamb that that John
[1:36:38] identified there when he looked to see
[1:36:40] the lion he saw a lamb the Bible says
[1:36:44] wounded for our transgression bruised
[1:36:47] for our
[1:36:49] iniquity so because there was a line
[1:36:54] on the
[1:36:55] altar it means that our prayers can be
[1:37:01] heard praise the Lord because our
[1:37:04] prayers are coming through the sacrifice
[1:37:07] that he
[1:37:08] made it's not coming on our works it's
[1:37:12] not coming on how how many hours we
[1:37:14] sweat it out no it's coming on the
[1:37:17] sacrifice that is on the
[1:37:19] throne are we together
[1:37:28] I will come back to the the the fifth
[1:37:30] SEI again before we close but let me
[1:37:32] read this last one this this is uh
[1:37:38] uh a
[1:37:40] comparison now they were living keeping
[1:37:44] the the the statute the Lord and so
[1:37:46] forth and they went down to
[1:37:50] worship during the time and Zachariah
[1:37:53] was a priest in the temple and his job
[1:37:58] was to wave the incense while the
[1:38:01] prayers of the saints were going up out
[1:38:05] in the congregation now that's the Old
[1:38:07] Testament Temple that's the Old
[1:38:09] Testament Tabernacle praise the Lord
[1:38:13] amen so that was the work of uh of of
[1:38:16] the priest that was the work of
[1:38:18] Zacharias he come and he blow he blow
[1:38:21] incense now you have to realize
[1:38:23] that God told Moses to build this
[1:38:26] Tabernacle according to the faction in
[1:38:28] heaven so here say here they had a type
[1:38:33] they had a physical type where the
[1:38:36] priest blow the incense before the
[1:38:38] people come in and and and and then and
[1:38:41] make their prayers to
[1:38:45] God that their prayers their desires and
[1:38:48] everything they express to God will will
[1:38:51] will will be a sweet smelling to to the
[1:38:55] Lord praise the Lord whether whether the
[1:38:58] confession of their Saints whether they
[1:39:00] are putting their sick need or whether
[1:39:02] they are putting their burden and asking
[1:39:04] God for for for deliverance when they
[1:39:07] come before they come into the place of
[1:39:10] worship and come and lift up their
[1:39:11] prayers that old priest goes there and
[1:39:14] he bow the incense and he makes sure
[1:39:16] that the place was smok it enough for
[1:39:18] the people to come in
[1:39:23] but yet when the seals were open in
[1:39:27] Revelation chapter 5 the very thing that
[1:39:30] was done in the physical temple on Earth
[1:39:34] we see that happening in
[1:39:37] heaven we see that happening when the
[1:39:39] seals were
[1:39:41] open praise the
[1:39:47] Lord hallelujah you see that is the
[1:39:51] reason why I mean uh uh uh no church or
[1:39:56] no Christian can strive without a prayer
[1:40:01] life praise the
[1:40:03] Lord
[1:40:06] amen no Christian can strive with our a
[1:40:09] prayer
[1:40:16] life no church can strive without a
[1:40:19] Praying people
[1:40:24] are we
[1:40:25] together I mean it's easy for us to to
[1:40:29] uh uh uh just get caught up in in uh in
[1:40:31] uh uh uh uh some some sort of emotion
[1:40:35] and you know and then uh we can we can
[1:40:37] we can you know run run the emotion of
[1:40:39] the People by the beat of the drum and
[1:40:42] and and and and and the farm music and
[1:40:44] you know and we come and just read some
[1:40:46] scripture and encourage the people you
[1:40:48] know God will see us through you know
[1:40:50] our God is more than able and we can say
[1:40:53] all of these things to the
[1:40:55] people but when the
[1:40:57] people are not lifting up their hearts
[1:41:00] in
[1:41:01] prayer if the people are not spending
[1:41:03] time with
[1:41:05] God praise the
[1:41:07] Lord when the people are not burning
[1:41:11] incense this time is not the physical
[1:41:13] incense it's your prayers that's how
[1:41:16] your prayers rise up to
[1:41:18] God praise the Lord
[1:41:23] every time you pray the prayer you are
[1:41:25] burning incense every time you you bring
[1:41:27] a prayer request you are burning incense
[1:41:29] for
[1:41:35] someone then read the next verse in
[1:41:39] Revelation the Bible says and they sing
[1:41:41] a new
[1:41:43] song do you see what I said the last
[1:41:45] time the order of the service prayer
[1:41:48] comes always before
[1:41:51] worship praise the Lord
[1:41:55] prayer comes before
[1:41:58] worship that's the reason why the
[1:42:00] beginning of the service is not when the
[1:42:02] song leader comes here the service begin
[1:42:04] when the first person comes through that
[1:42:07] door and get in prayer that's when the
[1:42:10] service begins that is the man that is
[1:42:13] burning incense that is the woman that
[1:42:15] is praying an atmosphere
[1:42:25] that's the next verse the Bible says
[1:42:27] then they sing a new
[1:42:30] song After the prayers has gone
[1:42:41] up praise the
[1:42:44] Lord but you see loudish your church is
[1:42:48] so
[1:42:50] busy that we have we we we we have we
[1:42:53] have organized a new order for
[1:42:57] service we get enough people in let's
[1:43:00] let's just wait let's just wait let's
[1:43:02] wait let's let's get 30 minutes they
[1:43:05] will come let's wait we wait for them to
[1:43:07] come then we say let's begin the
[1:43:10] service that's not God's
[1:43:13] order praise the
[1:43:15] Lord not not not God's order Zacharias
[1:43:19] was not waiting for the people to show
[1:43:21] up before he burn in in he knew that he
[1:43:24] needed to burn incense I believe
[1:43:27] certainly there were there that he
[1:43:28] burned incense and nobody
[1:43:31] came praise the Lord but just that sweet
[1:43:34] smell rising up to
[1:43:37] heaven was an intercession for the
[1:43:43] people that's what the laisha church has
[1:43:46] become we wait for the people we're not
[1:43:50] supposed to wait for the people we need
[1:43:53] to wait on
[1:43:54] God don't wait for the people we wait on
[1:44:03] God praise the
[1:44:07] Lord that's right onor the opening of
[1:44:10] our
[1:44:12] seals it shows us the things that is
[1:44:15] that is important not even the
[1:44:19] Revelation John have not even seen what
[1:44:21] was in the seals
[1:44:24] he didn't even know what the seals
[1:44:27] contain but the first thing the first
[1:44:30] thing that he saw when the lamb took the
[1:44:34] book was the
[1:44:36] prayers of the
[1:44:40] Saints praise the Lord the prayers of
[1:44:43] the Saints are more important than the
[1:44:46] Revelation because the revelation will
[1:44:48] only become a head knowledge if there is
[1:44:51] no prayer to back it up
[1:44:57] the prayers of the Saints is more
[1:44:58] important than the explanation of the
[1:45:02] Bible comparing scripture with scripture
[1:45:04] comparing quotes with quotes all of
[1:45:06] those things are just
[1:45:09] information if the church don't have no
[1:45:11] prayer that's the reason why we have all
[1:45:13] of these Revelation but yes we have
[1:45:15] forces and
[1:45:17] strife we have all of this
[1:45:20] Revelation everything we have been
[1:45:25] taught but it's all because the church
[1:45:28] is filling in praying she's not burning
[1:45:32] incense praise the
[1:45:36] lord we must not go without our a prayer
[1:45:42] need if you don't have nothing in your
[1:45:44] life to pray about there is something
[1:45:46] your neighbor need to pray about there
[1:45:49] is something your brother need to pray
[1:45:51] about there is something the church need
[1:45:53] to pray
[1:45:54] about the reason why we don't have
[1:45:57] prayer needs is because we don't we
[1:45:58] don't have
[1:46:02] burden if your heart is burden you will
[1:46:05] always find something to pray
[1:46:11] about we rush into praying and we rush
[1:46:16] out if that's a place that the church is
[1:46:18] afraid to stay is in the place of
[1:46:20] praying and that's the place that she
[1:46:22] supposed to
[1:46:30] be praise the
[1:46:32] Lord that is the place that she's
[1:46:34] supposed to
[1:46:38] be before even John will start seeing
[1:46:40] the the horse riders he will start
[1:46:42] seeing the pl he will start seeing
[1:46:44] everything that would be in the seals to
[1:46:46] be revealed the first thing that he saw
[1:46:49] when the lamb took the book
[1:46:53] the prayers of the saints that was the
[1:46:55] first thing that he saw and when those
[1:46:58] prayers were poured out then the Bible
[1:47:01] says they sing a new song because the
[1:47:04] atmosphere was right for
[1:47:06] worship when the prayers were poured out
[1:47:09] the atmosphere was right for
[1:47:11] worship we never have a right atmosphere
[1:47:15] until we have a Praying
[1:47:17] Church you will never have a right
[1:47:20] attitude of worship until you have a
[1:47:22] Praying life
[1:47:28] praise the Lord may God help every one
[1:47:31] of us praise the Lord may he help
[1:47:36] us we don't need that
[1:47:39] emotion you just need the
[1:47:42] discipline praise the Lord you just need
[1:47:45] the discipline that you can see in
[1:47:48] need you can see in need you can see
[1:47:51] something that you're not happy about
[1:47:54] you don't have to wait for the Wednesday
[1:47:56] night service you could stay right where
[1:47:59] you are and say Lord Jesus please help
[1:48:02] that
[1:48:04] lady it's a heart it's it's a heart that
