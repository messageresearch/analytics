[39:23] This is my

[40:26] song. Praising the
[40:30] Savior all of the
[40:34] [Music]
[40:37] living. Praise the Lord. I had to hear
[40:41] the bass drum to know that you were in
[40:42] church. Welcome back. Praise the
[40:45] Lord. Welcome back, brother
[40:48] Ariel. The Lord bless you. Thank you,
[40:50] musicians. That will be all for the
[40:53] music. And uh thank you. Thank
[40:58] you. While we standing to our feet,
[41:00] let's take the book of Psalm. Psalm
[41:02] chapter
[41:07] 68. Psalm chapter 68.
[41:13] We want to thank the Lord for giving us
[41:14] good service on uh the Easter weekend
[41:17] with brother Crosby once again. He sent
[41:20] his greetings from uh from the UK and he
[41:24] and the wife got home from sibling and
[41:29] u is uh you know it's it's very
[41:32] beautiful when you see you see the Holy
[41:34] Spirit uh comes in uh Psalm chapter 68.
[41:41] You see the Holy Spirit comes and then
[41:44] he takes the very things that you've
[41:46] been talking about and bring it through
[41:49] the mouth of a complete
[41:51] visitor. Praise the Lord. Because we've
[41:54] been talking about the prince of Pure
[41:57] and uh uh Messiah the prince. That was
[42:00] where we started that subject from
[42:03] talking about the prince power. If you
[42:05] you follow that language, you you look
[42:09] in the in Daniel chapter 9, uh because
[42:13] of what uh uh um Gabriel, because of
[42:19] what the the the angel Gabriel
[42:22] experienced, the battle uh in the
[42:25] heavens with the prince of Persia when
[42:28] he came to Daniel, he says, "The prince
[42:31] of Persia handle me, but your prince
[42:35] fought on your behalf.
[42:38] Praise the Lord. So the Bible uses that
[42:42] word the prince of Pesia or it uses the
[42:44] word prince. When you go through the
[42:47] scripture, it talks about the prince of
[42:49] the power of the air talking about
[42:52] spiritual forces. Amen. The Bible called
[42:55] Jesus the prince of
[42:58] life. So uh uh it's all about spiritual
[43:02] warfare.
[43:04] about spiritual warfare. The weapons of
[43:06] our warfare are not kind of like the
[43:09] scripture says. It's all about bringing
[43:11] down strongholds. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[43:15] You must be able to bring down
[43:17] strongholds. You must be able to to
[43:20] clear your heavens.
[43:22] You must be able to open the heavens to
[43:24] get on Jacob ladder to go up and come
[43:27] down. Praise the Lord. If you are not
[43:30] able to bring down stronghold, you will
[43:34] be so burdened. You'll be so lazy. You
[43:36] came praying, you just worried, you
[43:38] know, it's all of those spirit of
[43:40] heaviness. Praise the Lord. Amen. So to
[43:43] see brother Crosby coming and then just
[43:46] stepping in there. Let's read. Let's
[43:48] read and I'll have you have your seat or
[43:50] I keep you standing and I start
[43:52] preaching. Psalm chapter 68. Let's read
[43:54] from verse one.
[43:58] Let God
[43:59] arise and let his enemy be scattered.
[44:03] Praise the Lord. In that same sense of
[44:06] spiritual warfare, let God arise, let
[44:09] his enemy be scattered. Let them also
[44:14] that hit him flee before him. As smoke
[44:18] is driven away, so drive them away. As
[44:23] wax melted before the fire, so let the
[44:26] wicked perish.
[44:28] at the presence of God. But let the
[44:31] righteous be glad. Let them rejoice
[44:34] before God. Yay. Let them exceedingly
[44:38] rejoice. Amen. I think that's what the
[44:41] presence of the Lord should bring to us.
[44:43] Amen. I think that's what the fellowship
[44:45] of the word should bring to us. Let's
[44:47] rejoice around the word. Let's rejoice
[44:50] around the things that are spoken to us.
[44:52] Amen. Sing unto God. Sing praises to his
[44:55] name. a stone him uh that rather upon
[44:59] the heavens by his name Jah and rejoice
[45:05] before him. That word J means Jehovah.
[45:08] Amen. Let's uh drop down now to verse 18
[45:13] from uh uh verse four or verse 5. Verse
[45:16] 5 says, "A father of the fatherless, a
[45:20] George of the widow is God in his holy
[45:23] habitation."
[45:25] Amen. That's verse five. Then let's drop
[45:27] to verse
[45:29] 18. Now this verse 18, we will see this
[45:33] is where Paul took uh he led captivity
[45:37] captives and gave gifts to men. He was
[45:39] repeating what David said in the psalm.
[45:42] So let's read verse 18 here. Thou has
[45:45] extended on high. Thou have led
[45:48] captivity captives.
[45:50] Thou has received gifts for men. Praise
[45:55] the Lord.
[45:58] In Ephesians, Paul said, "Thou has gave
[46:01] gifts unto men." Honor prophecy, David
[46:04] said, you receive gifts. But when the
[46:07] Holy Ghost came, then he gave gifts.
[46:10] Praise the Lord. Amen. Are we together?
[46:14] Praise the Lord.
[46:16] There has on high. There has led
[46:19] captivity captive, there has received
[46:22] gifts for men. Yay, for the rebellious
[46:27] also. So, a man can be rebellious and
[46:30] still be gifted, right?
[46:34] That's what we want we want to talk
[46:36] about a little bit this morning. A man
[46:38] can be rebellious, a man can be sinful
[46:41] and still be gifted.
[46:44] for the rebellious also that the Lord
[46:48] might do among them. Blessed be the Lord
[46:52] who daily loaded us. Loaded not only
[46:56] gave but he loaded. Can you carry it?
[47:02] Praise the Lord.
[47:05] Amen. Let's let's read that last verse
[47:08] together. Amen. I don't want to read it
[47:10] myself. You take it as yours. Amen.
[47:12] Amen. Blessed be the Lord who daily
[47:17] loaded us with benefits, even the God of
[47:21] our salvation. Amen. The Lord bless you.
[47:24] You can have your seat while we go to
[47:26] Ephesians chapter 4. Can you carry it?
[47:30] He's not just giving, he loading. Praise
[47:33] the Lord. Amen.
[47:36] We so lazy to carry it. That's why we
[47:39] think we don't have it. But he's
[47:41] loading.
[47:44] Amen.
[47:46] Who loaded us with benefits?
[47:51] Amen.
[47:52] I feel like changing
[47:54] my subject to preach this morning.
[47:59] Amen.
[48:01] You know Daryl Wall says we must sing
[48:04] fill my truck Lord, not my cup.
[48:09] He said we must sing fill my truck Lord.
[48:12] Yes. I know if you'll be able to lift a
[48:15] truck up to him and was fill my truck. I
[48:18] drive I drive it up, Lord.
[48:23] Amen. Ephesians chapter 4. Let's
[48:26] uh let's enjoy the word this morning.
[48:30] Hope that the Lord will be gracious to
[48:32] be able to bring it in a way that we can
[48:35] relate to
[48:37] it. Ephesians chapter 4. Let's uh look
[48:40] at
[48:43] uh verse 5
[48:46] verse4 verse 4. Ephesians chapter 4 uh
[48:50] verse 4. There is one body and one
[48:53] spirit even as ye are called in one hope
[48:56] of your calling. One Lord, one faith,
[48:59] one baptism, one God, the Father of
[49:05] all, who is above
[49:07] all and through all and in all. This
[49:13] must explain the Trinity, right? Amen.
[49:17] Or it must explain the Godhead, right?
[49:22] It must explain the Godhead. It's one
[49:25] God.
[49:27] the father of all who is above all in
[49:32] the fatherhood. Amen.
[49:36] And through all
[49:38] praise the Lord just like he did in the
[49:41] sunship. And that's the same thing he's
[49:43] doing in us. Right? God is in his
[49:47] creation. Right?
[49:49] That's why they can worship trees
[49:51] because they see an attribute of the
[49:53] creator in his creation. They can
[49:56] worship rocks and water because the sea
[49:59] uh h an attribute of the creator in his
[50:04] creation. So he's above all. He's true
[50:07] all and in you all. Praise the lord. So
[50:13] we are definitely part of the godhead.
[50:16] Deity is not in heaven. Deity is in you
[50:21] because it's Christ in you. the hope of
[50:25] glory. Praise the Lord. Can we say that
[50:28] this morning? Christ in me. The hope of
[50:32] glory. Praise the Lord. We can do it
[50:35] better. Christ in me the hope of glory.
[50:39] You are part of the deity.
[50:42] Amen.
[50:44] Praise the Lord.
[50:48] But onto every one of us is giving
[50:50] grace. I call him to measure of the gift
[50:55] of Christ. When he ascended, he received
[50:59] gift. So that gift is given to us all by
[51:03] measure. Praise the Lord. So God don't
[51:07] have no useless part in his body.
[51:11] Every part of God's body is very useful.
[51:16] There is no useless part. Amen.
[51:21] Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:24] There is no useless path. He's not even
[51:26] handicapped.
[51:30] Wherefore he said when he ascended up on
[51:34] high, he led captivity captives and gave
[51:38] gifts to men. So this happened after the
[51:41] ascension that brother Crosby spoke on
[51:44] Saturday. After the
[51:46] ascension, that's when this happened.
[51:49] Now
[51:50] he Now that he ascended, what is it? But
[51:55] that he also descended first into the
[51:59] lowest part of the earth. So that was
[52:03] what he was doing when he was crucified.
[52:05] He gave up the ghost. his uh uh you know
[52:08] his uh soul went down to to hell uh to
[52:12] be able to witness to the souls that
[52:15] were in prison to be able to take the
[52:17] keys of death and life from the enemy
[52:20] and uh uh in all of there. So he first
[52:23] descended to the lowest part of the
[52:24] earth. He that descended is the same
[52:28] also that
[52:29] ascended up far above all heavens that
[52:33] he might fill all things. Praise the
[52:37] Lord. Then Paul will now talk about he
[52:41] gave some those are some of the gifts
[52:43] that were given. Praise the Lord. In the
[52:46] book of Corinthian, he talk also talk
[52:48] about gifts of administration, gifts of
[52:51] uh you know uh uh and all of that. So uh
[52:55] uh that's what we want to look at this
[52:57] morning. That's what we want to look at.
[52:59] But what where I want to bring us to
[53:01] this morning is that we by the grace of
[53:05] God, every one of us here that are alive
[53:08] have just uh
[53:10] witnessed a varied uh uh uh whether you
[53:15] pay attention to it or not, you know, uh
[53:18] uh we realize that on Monday the pope
[53:22] passed away. Yes.
[53:24] and uh and this entire week were just
[53:29] filled with uh uh ceremony in the
[53:34] Vatican
[53:35] uh for bearing of the pope and all of
[53:38] them. Now uh you might think that it it
[53:43] does not concern you. You might think
[53:45] that uh uh
[53:48] uh or maybe you were not conscious
[53:51] enough to pay attention to what was
[53:53] happening uh at that
[53:57] time. We see
[54:00] you now. So, uh
[54:03] uh
[54:06] but I I I've been thinking about it all
[54:09] through the week and uh uh some friends
[54:12] at work asked me, we were talking, you
[54:15] know, uh
[54:23] uh you know, I'm I'm just I'm trying to
[54:26] control myself because I I work with
[54:28] some characters.
[54:31] You know, one of one of the guys is uh I
[54:35] think we can nom we can nom nominate uh
[54:38] blood for the pope. That's that's what
[54:42] was in my head. I was kind of trying
[54:48] to but one of them asked me the question
[54:51] and says and said do you think we will
[54:54] be a we will have an American
[54:57] p? I said well
[55:00] uh there is there is
[55:04] possibility but uh what many people
[55:07] don't know is that the
[55:11] uh the foreign fathers left
[55:15] Europe because of
[55:18] Catholic oppression.
[55:22] So when they came over to the United
[55:26] States, at first they never wanted to
[55:28] have anything to do with
[55:30] Catholicism. They wanted to, you know,
[55:32] they frown at Catholicism,
[55:36] but because of prophecy,
[55:39] Cathalism was able to find its way into
[55:42] America. Right?
[55:46] But America Catholism is different from
[55:50] the rest of the Catholicism around the
[55:52] world. If you if you read, if you pay
[55:57] attention
[56:00] because all the Catholism around the
[56:02] world, the Vatican has a very strong
[56:06] hand on
[56:07] them. Not with American
[56:12] Catholicism. Yes. So in the Catholic
[56:16] world, they call Catholism in America
[56:20] American Catholism.
[56:26] And it's for a reason, biblical reason.
[56:29] We'll look into some of that this
[56:31] morning. And uh
[56:33] [Music]
[56:34] uh so
[56:38] uh the the the pope was finally
[56:48] buried and
[56:50] now they must elect a new
[56:53] pope. So right now as you and myself uh
[56:57] are speaking this morning they are
[56:59] cadinets they are behind the sacred door
[57:02] they are passing ballots are calling to
[57:05] their ritual and who will become the
[57:08] next
[57:09] pope but why is it important brother one
[57:14] it's important
[57:16] because the next
[57:19] pope could shape the entire
[57:22] world it's not the
[57:25] man is the time, the season of time that
[57:29] we are living in.
[57:33] Praise the Lord. We already have an
[57:37] economic crisis around us.
[57:41] And that economic crisis speaks of a
[57:44] time that the Bible says men will not be
[57:47] able to buy or sell.
[57:53] Praise the
[57:54] Lord. You know these things are uh they
[57:58] are the divine words of God. As human we
[58:02] we try to put it in our mind. We try to
[58:05] picture it. We try to make uh uh uh a
[58:09] mental image so it can make sense to
[58:13] us. Praise the Lord. But many times when
[58:17] God bring his word to pass sometime is
[58:20] far from the way we imagine it in our
[58:22] mind.
[58:24] Praise the Lord. If we are Bible
[58:28] readers, if we are studying our Bible
[58:31] and we are we are we are praying to God
[58:34] and and the Holy Ghost is there. When
[58:36] the word comes to pass, when the word of
[58:39] God is coming to pass and the word is in
[58:43] you, the Holy Ghost quicken you to see,
[58:46] look at it.
[58:49] The Bible says when Jesus in John
[58:52] chapter 2 went into the temple, took the
[58:55] whip and started whipping the people,
[58:57] kicking the table up, the Holy Ghost
[58:59] brought to the mind of the disciples.
[59:01] They had not received the Holy Ghost
[59:03] yet, but the Holy Ghost brought to their
[59:05] mind to remind them what David said in
[59:08] the psalm, the zeal of the house has
[59:12] eaten
[59:13] me. Praise the Lord. Because if God did
[59:17] not do that, they would think that their
[59:20] leader is
[59:21] crazy. Because they all believe the
[59:24] temple to be a sacred place. What is he
[59:27] doing? Is he really the Messiah? So God
[59:31] has to quicken the word to them. Yeah.
[59:34] For them to believe in his leadership.
[59:40] Are we together?
[59:44] So that's how God we we we have all of
[59:47] these things. We we have a mental
[59:49] picture of you know how uh you know uh
[59:52] uh you know the mark of the beast, how
[59:53] this is going to happen, you know, and
[59:55] all of that. Uh uh far be it. Far be it.
[59:58] Don't don't make a conclusion on what
[1:00:00] I'm saying. But I won't say we get into
[1:00:02] the mark of the beast. Please don't make
[1:00:04] a
[1:00:05] conclusion. I'm just trying to bring
[1:00:07] your mind to a place. Uh uh uh
[1:00:11] because
[1:00:13] uh on under that leader
[1:00:17] uh uh that will lead us to pedition
[1:00:20] there will be a period of prosperity.
[1:00:25] Bible says when they say uh uh uh you
[1:00:29] know peace be peace suddenly comes
[1:00:31] destruction so there will be a period of
[1:00:33] prosperity but I'm just trying to to use
[1:00:36] this
[1:00:37] occasion and uh
[1:00:40] uh show you in the
[1:00:44] Bible what the Bible says about this
[1:00:46] time that we are living this time that
[1:00:49] we are living in. And uh so that's what
[1:00:52] we want to talk about this morning. I
[1:00:54] want to I want to I want to speak from
[1:00:56] Revelation chapter 17. So if you want to
[1:00:59] go there in your Bible, you want to
[1:01:01] write it in your notes. If you also want
[1:01:04] to follow the projection on the word, we
[1:01:07] on the wall, we will we will read from
[1:01:09] Revelation chapter 17. Revelation
[1:01:12] chapter 17. That's where I'm taking my
[1:01:15] subject from this morning.
[1:01:18] And uh as as we get into this, I want to
[1:01:22] remind us what we have been told before
[1:01:25] is later than we think.
[1:01:30] Is later than we think. The only future
[1:01:34] we have as a people of God is the
[1:01:38] rapture.
[1:01:40] Praise the Lord. Make your plans to get
[1:01:44] married. Make your plans to raise your
[1:01:47] children. Make your plans to get a
[1:01:50] better home. But include the rapture in
[1:01:53] every plan that you are making because
[1:01:57] that is our only setting future that we
[1:02:01] have is the coming of the Lord is the
[1:02:05] rapture. Now, so uh uh as we as we look
[1:02:09] into this this morning, uh oh, praise
[1:02:12] the Lord. Are we together?
[1:02:16] Are we
[1:02:18] together? Now, so I want to I want to uh
[1:02:22] uh read from Revelation chapter
[1:02:24] 17:E8. That's what I'm taking my subject
[1:02:27] from this
[1:02:29] morning. I'm not uh I don't I don't want
[1:02:32] to I don't want to appeal to your
[1:02:35] flesh by just making you scary. No,
[1:02:39] that's not my my my mission this morning
[1:02:42] because I can make you scary. You get
[1:02:44] out there, you laugh, it go away.
[1:02:47] I want to I want to make contact with
[1:02:50] your spirit this morning and uh just for
[1:02:53] you to see the seriousness of the time
[1:02:56] that we are living. That's what I want
[1:02:58] to do and trusting that the grace of God
[1:03:00] will help us to do that. Amen. Because
[1:03:04] remember now David prophesied. He
[1:03:09] said that I ascended up high and receive
[1:03:13] gifts for
[1:03:15] men for the godly and for the
[1:03:18] rebellious.
[1:03:21] Are we together? Amen. For the godly and
[1:03:25] for the
[1:03:26] rebellious. So you see it's just like
[1:03:28] the Bible says leaders are are of
[1:03:33] God. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:36] Amen. If a man is ordained to do a
[1:03:39] certain work, what happen is that God
[1:03:43] will give him the gifts. God will anoint
[1:03:46] him to do it.
[1:03:49] Are we together? Amen. Look for example
[1:03:52] in in the time of Elijah
[1:03:55] uh
[1:03:59] uh
[1:04:01] Elijah when the Lord met him in the cave
[1:04:03] the Lord told him to go and anoint three
[1:04:07] men to go and anoint
[1:04:11] Elisha. Sorry I didn't I was I was not
[1:04:14] thinking about that until now as I going
[1:04:16] to include it in my notes. So we read it
[1:04:17] together. But to go and anoint Elasha in
[1:04:20] his tail. Elisha would take his place to
[1:04:23] go and anoint
[1:04:25] Jood and to go and anoint uh
[1:04:29] uh uh
[1:04:31] Aizer. So there were three men that God
[1:04:34] told Elijah to go and
[1:04:37] anoint. But
[1:04:39] Elijah only
[1:04:42] anointed
[1:04:43] Elisha in his place by throwing his
[1:04:47] metal on
[1:04:49] Elisha and Elisha burned you know all
[1:04:52] his plotting materials and then he went
[1:04:55] after Elijah. But as you read the
[1:04:58] scripture you will realize that it was
[1:05:01] Elasher that anointed the other two men.
[1:05:05] Now see why God would do this is because
[1:05:08] God has said by
[1:05:10] Elijah that the dogs will lick the blood
[1:05:14] of Jezebel. Right. Amen. And God has
[1:05:19] also said by Elijah because Ahab took
[1:05:23] Neb's father's vine. That's right. That
[1:05:26] he was going to pay for it.
[1:05:30] Okay. Oh, this is beautiful. If if we
[1:05:32] can just be able to see it. So here is
[1:05:34] it say that God is going to anoint two
[1:05:38] men to do this
[1:05:40] work. Joo was anointed to deal with the
[1:05:43] Jezebel spirit. Right. He was the one
[1:05:46] that threw Jezebel through the window.
[1:05:48] Yeah. Yes.
[1:05:51] Aiza. He was a Syrian, right? Just a
[1:05:55] common man in the Syrian military. When
[1:05:59] Elisha met him, the Bible say
[1:06:02] Elisha broke the oil and pour it upon
[1:06:06] his head and he started crying. Elijah
[1:06:09] Elisha started crying. He says, "Oh my
[1:06:13] Lord, why are you
[1:06:15] crying?" He says, "Because I see the
[1:06:18] evil that you would do to the children
[1:06:21] of Israel." That's right. I see how you
[1:06:23] would rap their women. He said, "Am I a
[1:06:26] dog?
[1:06:28] And you mean am I so
[1:06:30] wicked? He did not know what the
[1:06:34] anointing would do. That's right.
[1:06:38] He did not know. He says, "Am I a dog
[1:06:42] that I will be Elijah Elisha said, I see
[1:06:46] uh you know h you will ravage the women.
[1:06:49] You will dash their babies on the wall."
[1:06:51] I mean just a young man. He says, "Oh my
[1:06:54] god, is that the way you thinking about
[1:06:56] me?" No.
[1:06:58] It's not how I'm thinking about you.
[1:07:00] It's what the Lord said about you.
[1:07:02] That's right. And he was the one that
[1:07:04] brought the war against
[1:07:06] Ahab where Ahab died in
[1:07:09] battle while Ju was the one that threw
[1:07:12] Jezebel through the window.
[1:07:16] So you see everything we do in this
[1:07:18] life,
[1:07:21] there is an influence, right? There is
[1:07:24] an anointing.
[1:07:26] Whichever one you call it, there is a
[1:07:28] power.
[1:07:31] Praise the Lord. Our body is just a
[1:07:34] vehicle.
[1:07:36] But everything we do, there is an
[1:07:40] anointing
[1:07:42] or there is an influence
[1:07:46] or there is a power.
[1:07:49] Are we together?
[1:07:51] Amen. Amen. I mean, you you follow the
[1:07:55] week and you you hear about the the life
[1:07:58] of uh of
[1:08:00] uh of uh uh Pope Francis. You you you
[1:08:05] hear about his life. His parents were
[1:08:07] immigrants, you know, that came from
[1:08:09] Spain and went over to to to Argentina,
[1:08:13] if I'm right, you know, and and that's
[1:08:15] where he grew. I mean uh uh uh uh he was
[1:08:19] he was studying to be uh uh uh I think
[1:08:24] some kind of a medical thing and uh uh
[1:08:26] but but I mean if you if you just listen
[1:08:29] to his life story to re to see how he he
[1:08:33] ended up with in a place of so much
[1:08:37] power.
[1:08:40] He was one of the most powerful men in
[1:08:44] the
[1:08:45] world. More than our president in uh uh
[1:08:49] United States, more than the one in
[1:08:50] Russia, more than the one in China, even
[1:08:53] the one in North Korea.
[1:08:57] The reason is because if you go back to
[1:09:01] the book of Daniel, you will realize by
[1:09:03] Daniel vision,
[1:09:06] there is only four superpower, right? By
[1:09:10] Daniel vision, I'm talking about
[1:09:13] prophetically now. There is only four
[1:09:16] super power.
[1:09:18] the head of gold,
[1:09:21] the breast of savor
[1:09:24] and uh uh the the the lions of br and
[1:09:28] the feet of iron.
[1:09:32] Are we together? So on a vision God gave
[1:09:37] dire concerning the gentile time the
[1:09:41] period of time that God will be dealing
[1:09:43] with the gentile full super
[1:09:48] power. So right now we are still under
[1:09:54] the Roman Empire right?
[1:09:57] We are under the Roman Empire.
[1:10:00] The only thing that have happened is
[1:10:03] that the wounded beast has been healed.
[1:10:07] Right.
[1:10:10] The beast was
[1:10:12] wounded when pagan Rome Yeah.
[1:10:17] decided to embrace Christianity. Oh yes.
[1:10:22] Oh yes. Are we together?
[1:10:25] when Constantine
[1:10:28] so uh uh if you know a little bit of the
[1:10:30] history that's when the Bible says his
[1:10:33] wound the wounded beast was healed
[1:10:34] that's where that's where it happened in
[1:10:36] in in in uh in time in prophecy and
[1:10:41] uh when he when he he you know tried to
[1:10:45] merge with the church first he asked the
[1:10:47] Christians in Rome to pray for him you
[1:10:50] know uh that he will win the war and you
[1:10:53] know and and he started uh being nice to
[1:10:55] the Christians and calling himself
[1:10:58] Christians and all of that. But what
[1:11:00] happened actually is that the uh he he
[1:11:04] end up losing the war. But what happened
[1:11:06] is that at a period of time he
[1:11:10] uh he uh uh he gave so much
[1:11:15] power to the church.
[1:11:20] He gave so much power not even knowing
[1:11:23] it. It's just like it's just like Kai
[1:11:27] standing before
[1:11:29] Pilate and saying according to our Lord
[1:11:33] one must be
[1:11:35] crucified and one must be released. Not
[1:11:38] even knowing he was prophesied.
[1:11:40] Are we together? That's the same way he
[1:11:43] did not know that he was he was you know
[1:11:46] hh getting on a prophecy because what
[1:11:49] will happen is that the the pig in Rome
[1:11:53] will will
[1:11:55] die and it will not change it will be
[1:11:59] healed into papa room. So on a pag in
[1:12:02] Rome they had
[1:12:06] king Nero and all of them uh you know uh
[1:12:10] uh uh Kyh Caesar you know and all of
[1:12:13] them were the Roman king
[1:12:16] on paparum they don't have king they
[1:12:20] have popes that's right
[1:12:23] so the pope
[1:12:25] was
[1:12:26] was the highest leader in the world and
[1:12:30] He is that office is the highest leading
[1:12:34] office in the
[1:12:37] world. Are we together? Is the highest
[1:12:41] leading office in the
[1:12:47] world. Is the highest leading office in
[1:12:49] the
[1:12:50] world. There's a big following of uh of
[1:12:54] uh of Catholic in in in in Mexico. If
[1:12:58] you look at Mexico history, you'll
[1:13:00] realize that at one time they got a
[1:13:02] president that was not a
[1:13:04] Catholic and and he was of the plan to
[1:13:09] kick capitalism out of
[1:13:14] Mexico. And at the same time the United
[1:13:18] States also were you know they were
[1:13:21] doing their drilled and their oil and
[1:13:23] everything you know uh and and he was
[1:13:26] also trying to kick uh you know to fight
[1:13:28] against them.
[1:13:31] So one order from
[1:13:36] Rome the US stepped
[1:13:39] in and kick him out.
[1:13:43] save the interest of
[1:13:45] capitalism and also save the US
[1:13:50] interest. I'm talking about the power
[1:13:54] that is behind that office, the
[1:13:57] influence that is behind that
[1:14:01] office. Are we together?
[1:14:06] Amen.
[1:14:07] So the the the the conclave the the uh
[1:14:14] uh
[1:14:15] uh all of those people they are there
[1:14:18] behind that sacred door they are passing
[1:14:22] ballot sometime this week or who know
[1:14:26] when there will be a white
[1:14:29] smoke that will
[1:14:31] come up from their chimney and that will
[1:14:34] announce the next pop. Who is he going
[1:14:36] to be? There is just lot of speculation.
[1:14:39] But if you even go back, if you go back,
[1:14:42] you will realize at the time uh uh uh
[1:14:45] Benedict stepped down because Benedict
[1:14:48] was the one that that was in before
[1:14:50] Francis. When he stepped down and they
[1:14:52] were to elect a new pope, you realize
[1:14:56] that uh this
[1:14:57] pope that is called Francis, he was not
[1:15:00] in the nominee.
[1:15:03] all the people that were that were
[1:15:05] nominated he was not he was not in a
[1:15:08] nominee.
[1:15:12] Are we together?
[1:15:14] So I mean uh uh uh everything that you
[1:15:17] are seeing on the media is just a guess.
[1:15:21] They are just guessing because of how
[1:15:24] dedicated all of those people, the one
[1:15:26] from the Philippines, the one from uh uh
[1:15:30] uh Hungary, the one from uh you know,
[1:15:32] they are just guessing because all of
[1:15:34] those people are dedicated to to the to
[1:15:37] to the to the Vatican. But who the new
[1:15:41] pope is going to
[1:15:42] be, we will never know until we see the
[1:15:46] white smoke.
[1:15:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:51] But I'll share some things with you this
[1:15:53] morning because we are living in
[1:15:55] prophetic hour.
[1:15:58] Amen. We are living in a day where uh uh
[1:16:03] I mean uh
[1:16:07] uh like Jesus would tell his disciple,
[1:16:10] watch and pray and you fall not into
[1:16:15] temptation. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:18] Amen. So that's that's where I'm going
[1:16:21] this morning. So just embrace yourself.
[1:16:23] Like I said, we'll have a lot of uh
[1:16:26] turbulence, but my my my purpose is not
[1:16:29] to scare you. My purpose is for us to be
[1:16:32] able to see the hour that we are living
[1:16:34] in and to see the reason
[1:16:37] why we have to stop playing church,
[1:16:42] right? Stop playing religion.
[1:16:45] Amen. And get serious with God.
[1:16:50] Because you see at the end of the day is
[1:16:53] that we could live aundred years, you
[1:16:56] know, watch our children grow up. I wish
[1:16:59] I I long for that. I want to see my
[1:17:00] girls get married. Praise the
[1:17:03] Lord. Amen. Because it's all they're
[1:17:06] always telling me how they will take
[1:17:07] care of their children better than I
[1:17:13] do. So I want to see that. Praise the
[1:17:16] Lord.
[1:17:17] Okay. So, uh uh uh I mean we not cutting
[1:17:21] the days short here, but we must also
[1:17:24] realize that even if the Lord gave us
[1:17:27] many years to come, it is not setting we
[1:17:31] could live all of those years.
[1:17:34] Some of us might go by the weight of the
[1:17:36] grave.
[1:17:39] Amen. Amen. That's one thing that is
[1:17:41] setting you know that some might go by
[1:17:43] the weight of the grave. And if you know
[1:17:46] the Lord allow us to go by the word of
[1:17:49] the grave, we want to be prepared.
[1:17:54] We want to be prepared. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:58] Was just having a little chit cchat this
[1:18:01] morning, you know, and uh you know,
[1:18:02] talking about uh you know, how many
[1:18:04] people are afraid to to fly, you know,
[1:18:07] uh uh me and one of the little one were
[1:18:09] talking. I said, "Well, I mean, uh uh I
[1:18:12] mean there are people that that stay
[1:18:14] right in their home, you know, uh uh I
[1:18:17] mean uh Sister Kelly was she were not
[1:18:20] flying. She was just taking her mailbox,
[1:18:23] taking her mail from the mail and and uh
[1:18:26] some crazy person running into her. You
[1:18:28] know, death can be us anywhere. The
[1:18:32] thing that is that is most important is
[1:18:35] for us to be ready, right? It's for us
[1:18:38] to be ready.
[1:18:40] So uh
[1:18:41] uh
[1:18:45] uh so like I said my my my mission is
[1:18:48] not to scare you. No I don't I don't uh
[1:18:52] uh we don't make converts by
[1:18:56] government is the Holy Ghost that change
[1:18:58] people hearts. Amen. And bring people to
[1:19:01] the reality of truth. But we want to
[1:19:02] show you things right in the word of God
[1:19:05] that thing the things that are happening
[1:19:07] around us. They are not just happening.
[1:19:08] There is nothing that is happening that
[1:19:11] is not spoken by this good book.
[1:19:16] Praise the Lord. So let's go right in
[1:19:18] there that Revelation chapter 17. Let's
[1:19:20] start up with that. Revelation chapter
[1:19:23] 17 verse8.
[1:19:26] There's a whole lot of things I wanted
[1:19:28] to go into but I thought I said
[1:19:31] uh
[1:19:33] people think that they will say where
[1:19:36] did where did this guy slept last
[1:19:38] night? Revelation chapter 17 verse8
[1:19:41] let's read the Bible says the beast that
[1:19:45] thou sawest was in his
[1:19:49] net and shall ascend out of the
[1:19:52] bottomless pit and go into pition. So
[1:19:56] that's what I that's how I name my my my
[1:19:58] my message this morning. A whole verse.
[1:20:02] I title my message the beast that
[1:20:04] extended out of the bottomless pit and
[1:20:09] goes into pedition. What does that
[1:20:12] means? What does that means? Now we just
[1:20:16] read from Psalm where David said h as he
[1:20:19] ascended up heart he had he received
[1:20:21] gifts for men. He received gifts for
[1:20:26] many. Are we together? For the
[1:20:29] rebellious also.
[1:20:32] That's what David
[1:20:33] said. Are we together? So Paul said
[1:20:38] before he ascended, he went to the
[1:20:41] lowest part which is the
[1:20:45] bottomless. Are we together? Yeah. Amen.
[1:20:49] So there what happened was there was a
[1:20:53] transition of paradise taking them from
[1:20:56] from from the place they were kept the
[1:20:58] old testament saints to what is now
[1:21:01] called the third heavens or beyond the
[1:21:04] curtain of time as you would like to
[1:21:06] call it. Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:10] And uh I saw the the the the Old
[1:21:14] Testament saints the righteous were
[1:21:17] removed, you know, uh uh from Satan's
[1:21:20] prison or from Satan's uh cage or
[1:21:23] whichever way we want to we want to call
[1:21:25] it where he kept them. They were moved
[1:21:27] now into another
[1:21:29] dimension. Praise the Lord. Amen. They
[1:21:32] were moved into another dimension. And
[1:21:35] uh uh but then there was also uh uh
[1:21:40] another
[1:21:45] ascension. Are we together? So let's
[1:21:48] let's read a little bit. Let's read that
[1:21:49] again. The beast that thou saw it uh
[1:21:54] um was and is not and sh ascend out of
[1:21:59] the bottomless pit and goes into pition.
[1:22:02] So there is there is a beast. A beast in
[1:22:05] the Bible represent a power. Amen. It
[1:22:09] represent a power. It represent an
[1:22:11] influence. It represent an anointing.
[1:22:15] So there is an anointing that leaves the
[1:22:19] bottomless pit. You remember one time we
[1:22:23] talked a little bit on that. The Bible
[1:22:26] says uh uh Isaiah 14:12, "How are thou
[1:22:31] fallen, oh
[1:22:33] Lucifer?" Jesus when he came, he says,
[1:22:36] "I see Satan falling." So So
[1:22:41] hell, the state of hell is a falling is
[1:22:45] a falling state.
[1:22:48] Praise the Lord. Many people when we
[1:22:50] talk about hell, you think about the
[1:22:52] lake of fire. There's not a lake of
[1:22:54] fire. There is there is a there is a
[1:22:56] dimension. There is a state a state that
[1:22:59] that an actual state that is a falling
[1:23:02] state and the Bible will describe it in
[1:23:06] a place like
[1:23:09] bottomless.
[1:23:11] Bottomless now it brings a lot of
[1:23:14] emphasis to the Christian faith because
[1:23:16] our faith is solid. We have a resting
[1:23:19] place.
[1:23:21] Amen. We have a resting place.
[1:23:30] That's the reason why we want foundation
[1:23:33] in
[1:23:34] everything. You want foundation in your
[1:23:37] faith life. What are you resting your
[1:23:40] faith on? Is it just being a church
[1:23:42] member or what are you resting your
[1:23:44] faith? Because if you don't have a place
[1:23:46] you are resting, then it's bottomless,
[1:23:50] right? You will just be
[1:23:52] falling. You will just be falling. You
[1:23:55] are your life will be in a constant
[1:23:57] descending order.
[1:24:02] You might be grabbing everything from
[1:24:03] Walmart and Target and things. You are
[1:24:05] having things but your life is not
[1:24:08] improving that you you hear the slogan
[1:24:10] people say well man life is hell.
[1:24:15] When a person say life is hell, it means
[1:24:18] that it's just not good. Something I
[1:24:22] mean I really don't get things together
[1:24:30] because these things they are they they
[1:24:34] are dimensional effect and the Bible can
[1:24:38] only put it in words for us to be able
[1:24:41] to understand it.
[1:24:44] But they are dimensional
[1:24:51] effect. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:54] The Bible says here uh uh uh uh uh Jesus
[1:24:59] said, "If I be lifted up, I would draw
[1:25:03] all men unto me." Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:08] So actually if he's drawing us unto him,
[1:25:12] he's lifting us up. But you see, we are
[1:25:16] not floating in the air. No, we are
[1:25:19] having dimensional effect on our life.
[1:25:23] That our life, the way we are thinking
[1:25:25] is above. Amen. The kind of people we
[1:25:30] are not using material substance
[1:25:36] as the essence of our life. So there is
[1:25:38] a dimensional effect that is taking
[1:25:40] place in the life of a believer
[1:25:44] because you've been lifted up. There is
[1:25:47] there is hope that is coming from the
[1:25:49] word of God that is lifting you up. That
[1:25:52] you can say today was good but tomorrow
[1:25:54] will be better. I believe it will be
[1:25:56] better. Why? There is a dimensional
[1:25:59] effect.
[1:26:02] Yeah. Praise the Lord. Amen. You can be
[1:26:05] sick lying down on the on the bed. Oh
[1:26:08] my. But dimensional effect will affect
[1:26:12] you in a sense you will be believing to
[1:26:14] rise up and not to go down.
[1:26:20] Amen.
[1:26:23] Are we together?
[1:26:27] So the Christian life we talk about
[1:26:29] spiritual warfare. All of these things
[1:26:32] they are dimensional
[1:26:35] effect. The angels of the Lord are in
[1:26:39] come about them that are around him.
[1:26:41] It's all dimensional effect.
[1:26:47] Are we together?
[1:26:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:52] You can see there two guys are walking
[1:26:55] on the
[1:26:57] street and uh and one I mean he's so
[1:27:03] depressed,
[1:27:05] frustrated, and the other guy I mean
[1:27:09] he's
[1:27:10] broke but I mean uh he just have the joy
[1:27:14] of the Lord.
[1:27:16] Are we together? Amen.
[1:27:19] Amen. Amen. I I I should I should not
[1:27:23] even carry you too far. The two men on
[1:27:26] the road of Emas.
[1:27:30] Amen. Jesus was affected by a
[1:27:35] dimension. He had just ascended and he
[1:27:38] was in another body. He was affected by
[1:27:42] a dimension. And these two men, they
[1:27:45] were also affected by a an a dimension,
[1:27:48] a dimension of sorrow. Their leader has
[1:27:52] died. The one that was the hope of
[1:27:54] Israel has
[1:27:56] died. Oh man, we we thought that he was
[1:27:59] the one. We thought that this this was
[1:28:01] the son of David. I almost I I wanted to
[1:28:04] say it. You know, they were depressed.
[1:28:07] Are we together? Amen. Amen.
[1:28:11] Now as they are walking
[1:28:14] together, Jesus asked them what matter
[1:28:17] of conversation you guys are having. Oh,
[1:28:19] are you a stranger yet? Didn't you hear
[1:28:21] about what has happened? Then the Bible
[1:28:23] says he said to them, "Oh fool, slow of
[1:28:28] heart. You don't you remember that Moses
[1:28:31] said that the Bible say he took them
[1:28:33] through all the scripture." Now, as he
[1:28:36] was quoting the scripture and telling
[1:28:38] them, uh, David said this, when David
[1:28:40] said this, I mean, when when when
[1:28:42] Ezekiel said this, he was changing the
[1:28:45] atmosphere around him.
[1:28:48] They did not know he was changing the
[1:28:50] atmosphere around him. The Bible says
[1:28:52] when the evening get close, he pretended
[1:28:55] as if he was going, they said, "No, come
[1:28:56] and stay with us, man." Amen. Amen. Come
[1:28:59] and stay with us.
[1:29:01] We were feeling depressed a while ago,
[1:29:04] but but you have just brought I mean
[1:29:07] kind of we love your let's let's talk
[1:29:09] about this thing.
[1:29:11] And the Bible says as they talk they
[1:29:13] make food and sat down and when he took
[1:29:15] the bread and he broke it
[1:29:20] the moment
[1:29:23] their eyes were open their dimension
[1:29:27] change. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:30] Praise the Lord. They left from the
[1:29:32] state of depression. Yes.
[1:29:35] Into a state of hope. Amen. That they
[1:29:38] can go and tell the other disciple, "Our
[1:29:41] Lord is raising."
[1:29:46] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. That's the
[1:29:48] same thing that happens when when when a
[1:29:49] when a when when a person is dropped
[1:29:51] dead right now. If I drop dead there
[1:29:52] right now, I step into a new body. Amen.
[1:29:56] Amen. Amen. You will get shock by seeing
[1:29:59] me going down to the ground. You will
[1:30:02] get
[1:30:02] shock in in in in our in our human
[1:30:05] sense. That's the feeling that we will
[1:30:07] have.
[1:30:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:12] No matter how many Holy Ghost we have,
[1:30:14] no one die and we start rejoicing. We
[1:30:17] are not there at that place. The people
[1:30:20] that rejoice are the people in the other
[1:30:22] body.
[1:30:24] Amen.
[1:30:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:28] Our our bing takes time to come to that
[1:30:31] reality.
[1:30:33] It takes time.
[1:30:38] Are we together?
[1:30:40] It takes time for us to catch up with
[1:30:42] the reality that well they have gone to
[1:30:45] a better place.
[1:30:51] Are we together? Now, I've gone all over
[1:30:54] the place. Now, where was I? Yeah. So,
[1:30:58] we see here that
[1:31:01] uh the Bible says
[1:31:07] uh a beast, a power ascended out of the
[1:31:11] bottomless pit. It came from a
[1:31:16] hopeless, a hopeless, a useless. You can
[1:31:20] use all the less
[1:31:23] cru. So it came from a bottleless pit.
[1:31:27] Now watch this. Now the Bible says and
[1:31:30] it goes into pedition. What is pedition?
[1:31:36] The Bible used there. It calls uh uh uh
[1:31:41] uh Judas the son of
[1:31:43] pedition. Are we together? Amen.
[1:31:47] Let's take our Bibles a little bit.
[1:31:51] I think I've I think I have got you to a
[1:31:54] good place this morning. Amen.
[1:31:58] I feel like I've got you to a good place
[1:32:00] this morning.
[1:32:04] Are you ready for the word?
[1:32:07] Amen.
[1:32:09] St. John chapter
[1:32:14] 17:12. Are you ready for the word? Amen.
[1:32:17] Can we say amen? Amen. Or are you scary
[1:32:20] already?
[1:32:22] I don't mean to make you scary though.
[1:32:25] And that that was a good thing. That was
[1:32:27] a good thing. Beautiful thing the Holy
[1:32:29] Ghost did on
[1:32:31] Sunday by by by preaching uh uh rebuking
[1:32:35] fear,
[1:32:37] moving from worry to warriors. Amen. It
[1:32:41] was a message to deal with fear and
[1:32:43] doubt.
[1:32:47] Because when you are worrying, you are
[1:32:49] scared.
[1:32:51] Tell me whatever you want to tell me.
[1:32:54] You are afraid.
[1:32:59] Is the is the physical evidence of of
[1:33:02] the spirit of fear. And the Bible say
[1:33:04] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:33:07] but he has given us a sound mind. That
[1:33:10] sound mind comes from the word.
[1:33:13] Are we together now? So, uh, St. John
[1:33:16] chapter 17. St. John chapter
[1:33:25] 17. Let's read verse 12. St. John
[1:33:27] chapter 17:12. Jesus said, "While I was
[1:33:31] with them in the word," he's praying now
[1:33:34] for his disciple, "I kept them in thy
[1:33:37] name. Those that thou given me I have
[1:33:42] kept and none of them is lost but the
[1:33:46] son of pedition that the scripture might
[1:33:50] be
[1:33:51] fulfilled. Amen. Amen. So uh there there
[1:33:56] the Bible was talk describing Judas that
[1:33:59] he was the son of
[1:34:01] pedition. Are we together?
[1:34:04] And then uh uh uh
[1:34:08] Philippian
[1:34:10] 1:28. Philippian
[1:34:13] 1:28. I just I just want to show you how
[1:34:16] that that uh uh that word is greatly
[1:34:21] used in the New
[1:34:24] Testament. Is used in the New Testament.
[1:34:27] And there and there is a
[1:34:29] reason. We'll look at that.
[1:34:35] Philippians 1:28 and in nothing
[1:34:37] terrified by your adversary which is to
[1:34:41] them an ev an evidence talking of
[1:34:44] pedition but to you a salvation and that
[1:34:48] of God. Are we together?
[1:34:52] Amen.
[1:34:55] Now this is this is uh this is very this
[1:34:58] is very deep. This is very strong for a
[1:35:02] believer and uh and Paul want us to pay
[1:35:05] attention to that here. Let's read that
[1:35:11] again. Let's let's drop back a little
[1:35:13] bit and and and then get a full sense a
[1:35:16] little context here. Verse 26,
[1:35:18] Philippian 1. that your rejoicing uh may
[1:35:22] may be more abounded in Jesus Christ for
[1:35:26] me by my coming to you again. Only let
[1:35:31] your
[1:35:32] conversation be as it becometh of the
[1:35:36] gospel be becometh the gospel of Christ
[1:35:40] that whether I come and uh and see you
[1:35:44] or else be
[1:35:46] absent I may year of your
[1:35:49] affair that ye stand fast in one spirit
[1:35:53] with one mind striving together for the
[1:35:56] faith of the gospel and in
[1:36:00] nothing terrified by your adversary. So
[1:36:05] he's saying don't get scared. Don't
[1:36:08] allow the spirit of fear to grab you
[1:36:12] because of what you are dealing with.
[1:36:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:17] Are we together? And see what he says.
[1:36:21] Which is to them an evidence token of
[1:36:25] pedition. But to you, but to you of
[1:36:29] salvation that is of God. Meaning when
[1:36:33] we are going through very
[1:36:36] trials, it is all working towards our
[1:36:39] salvation. Praise the Lord. Amen. But
[1:36:43] the people of the word
[1:36:46] has a way of saying because you are
[1:36:50] going through this your end will be
[1:36:51] this.
[1:36:54] So you see what he's saying. My my amen.
[1:36:57] They take that as a token as an evidence
[1:37:00] of pedition which mean destruction which
[1:37:04] mean lost completely
[1:37:07] lost. Are we together?
[1:37:10] How can you say you are serving God and
[1:37:12] your life is just like this to them? I
[1:37:15] mean you are wasting your time. That's
[1:37:17] how they take it. But to a believer, he
[1:37:21] takes it as something that is building
[1:37:24] character in him to be able to trust the
[1:37:27] invisible.
[1:37:31] That's right. Are we together? Trying to
[1:37:33] bring uh the sense of the word from the
[1:37:36] scripture to you. Let's take another
[1:37:39] one. Uh Paul speaks of that in uh uh uh
[1:37:43] 1 Timothy chapter 6.
[1:37:55] might go in line a little bit with what
[1:37:57] we just read. 1 Timothy chapter 6, let's
[1:38:00] take verse 6. But godliness with
[1:38:03] contentment is a great gain.
[1:38:05] Amen. It was now part of my know. I saw
[1:38:08] it. It's a beautiful scripture. So,
[1:38:09] let's read it. But godliness with
[1:38:12] contentment is a great gain.
[1:38:15] For we brought nothing into this word,
[1:38:18] and it is certain we can carry nothing
[1:38:22] out. And having food and remain, let let
[1:38:25] us be there with contempt.
[1:38:29] But they
[1:38:30] that will be reached fall into
[1:38:33] temptation and a
[1:38:36] snail, and into many foolish and hurtful
[1:38:40] lusts, which draw
[1:38:45] men in destruction and pedition. Praise
[1:38:50] the Lord. Now see what the apostles
[1:38:53] started started with contentment.
[1:38:57] Amen.
[1:38:59] contentment. If uh if if the Lord is
[1:39:02] blessing us, let's be
[1:39:04] content. Amen. Let's let's let's be able
[1:39:08] to judge between content and greed.
[1:39:14] Let's be able to judge as as as a as a
[1:39:16] believer, you must be able to sense
[1:39:18] yourself this thing you want. Is it
[1:39:19] greed
[1:39:24] or is it is it necessity? Is it
[1:39:27] necessary now? So it is not in a place
[1:39:31] of where Paul is kind of a you knowh
[1:39:35] throwing a hopeless state on rich
[1:39:37] people. No because Joseph Amatias was a
[1:39:40] wealthy man that gave his grave to Jesus
[1:39:44] Christ. So he's not tempting, but he's
[1:39:47] he's he's making us to be able to see
[1:39:50] that uh uh uh you know uh they that are
[1:39:54] only living for this world riches.
[1:39:58] If they are only living for this world
[1:40:01] riches, it's easy to fall into
[1:40:03] temptation because the more they get,
[1:40:06] the more they want.
[1:40:09] Amen.
[1:40:11] And any way they can get
[1:40:13] it, any way they can get it, they want
[1:40:17] more and any way they can get it. So
[1:40:19] that's what he's trying to say. It it,
[1:40:21] you know, it drowns men into destruction
[1:40:25] and pedition. Amen. A state of lust, a
[1:40:29] state of hopelessness, a state of
[1:40:32] confusion.
[1:40:34] Now, so we're doing all of this to
[1:40:36] establish the fact of the beast that
[1:40:39] came from the bottomless pit and went
[1:40:42] into pedition. He couldn't go
[1:40:44] up. He ascended but couldn't go any
[1:40:48] further. He went straight into lust,
[1:40:51] into destruction,
[1:40:55] confusion. Are we together? Amen. That's
[1:40:57] that's what I want you to see as we as
[1:41:00] we kind of establish this together. And
[1:41:03] uh uh you will see that
[1:41:14] here and uh Paul used the same words
[1:41:19] also in uh uh second Peter chapter 3 and
[1:41:23] and all of that. Okay, I've given you
[1:41:24] few. If not, I will stay right here and
[1:41:26] don't go into what I want to talk about
[1:41:27] this morning and just waste all my time.
[1:41:31] Now, so we we we we get our subject
[1:41:34] there. The beast that thou
[1:41:37] saw was and is not. Now, that's what I
[1:41:41] want us to be able to watch. Now, these
[1:41:43] words was and is not and yet to come.
[1:41:46] Let's let's read that a little bit so we
[1:41:48] can for just for us to be able to get a
[1:41:50] context of uh what we reading here. The
[1:41:54] beast that thou saw was and is not and
[1:41:56] shall ascend out of the bottomless pit
[1:41:57] and go into pition and they that dwell
[1:42:00] on the earth shall wonder whose name
[1:42:04] were now written in the book of life. If
[1:42:07] you follow the priest finra this this
[1:42:09] this week this gone week you will
[1:42:12] realize that the word
[1:42:14] wonder the word
[1:42:18] wonder. Praise the Lord. Amen. The word
[1:42:22] wonder. Amen.
[1:42:25] The word wonder. Let's let's go ahead.
[1:42:28] Whose names are now written in the the
[1:42:30] book of life from the foundation of the
[1:42:32] word. When they behold the beast that
[1:42:37] was and is not and yet is. What does
[1:42:42] that
[1:42:43] means? What does that
[1:42:46] means? That's what we want to study this
[1:42:48] morning. What does that
[1:42:53] means? Verse 9. And and and here and
[1:42:58] here is the mind which have wisdom. The
[1:43:02] seven
[1:43:04] heads are seven
[1:43:06] mountains on which the woman sitted. I
[1:43:09] didn't read from verse one, but uh the
[1:43:12] only city that sit on seven mountain is
[1:43:15] the Vatican. That's right. That's the
[1:43:17] only city that sit on seven mountain.
[1:43:20] Are we together? And every woman, every
[1:43:23] nation is takes the femin the feminine
[1:43:27] gender. So the woman sitting on seven
[1:43:30] mountain was a
[1:43:32] city. Are we together? Amen. I'm not
[1:43:35] speaking on that, but I really I just
[1:43:37] want to drop that in. Now verse 10. And
[1:43:40] there are seven kings. Five are fallen
[1:43:43] and one is and the other is not yet
[1:43:49] come. And when he cometh, he must
[1:43:53] continue a short
[1:43:55] space. And the beast that was and is
[1:43:59] not, even he is the eighth, and is of
[1:44:05] the
[1:44:06] seven, and goeth into pedition. What
[1:44:11] that what does that all what does that
[1:44:13] mean? And is and is not and yet is. What
[1:44:17] it means is
[1:44:20] that men are changing the office. Yeah.
[1:44:24] But the power is the same. That's right.
[1:44:26] That's all it
[1:44:28] means. It's talking about succession of
[1:44:32] popes. That's right. That will be under
[1:44:34] the same anointing to do the same work.
[1:44:40] Are we together? Let's read uh uh let's
[1:44:43] just let me read this to you while we in
[1:44:45] our
[1:44:48] denomination. Now
[1:44:50] watch the beast. Now the beast wasn't a
[1:44:56] king. He was one which is which is not
[1:45:02] and yet he is and is not. Yet he is.
[1:45:07] What is it? succession of popes, right?
[1:45:11] A power, a beast ruling. There is a
[1:45:15] beast. There is a power that is ruling,
[1:45:18] but that power will go through many men.
[1:45:24] Are we together? Are you seeing the
[1:45:26] picture? Yeah. There is there is a power
[1:45:30] that is ruling, but that power will go
[1:45:32] through many
[1:45:35] men. So what is it? Secession of pop, a
[1:45:38] power, a
[1:45:40] beast. That's when pagan Rome was
[1:45:44] converted into papa room because pagan
[1:45:47] room was ruled by kings.
[1:45:51] Caesar and all of those men were the
[1:45:53] kings that ruled pagan Rome. when when
[1:45:57] at the at the Nissan council when when
[1:46:00] uh when they when they when they
[1:46:02] embraced the the the church, they
[1:46:05] embraced Christianity not only because
[1:46:09] they wanted to be Christian because they
[1:46:11] saw that that was an influence.
[1:46:15] Praise the Lord. Because when you look
[1:46:17] into the into the the the the Roman
[1:46:20] history, they they set their own city on
[1:46:23] fire and they told the people that it
[1:46:26] was the Christians that burned their
[1:46:28] city. Yeah. Now, you have to realize,
[1:46:32] you go back to Bible days, you will
[1:46:34] realize that uh uh uh uh uh most of
[1:46:37] those people, Christians that were in
[1:46:38] Rome and all of that, they were all
[1:46:40] servants and you know, and and and and
[1:46:42] different kind of a people.
[1:46:45] and uh and and and there was a plague
[1:46:48] that also broke out in
[1:46:51] Rome. The only savior's place was in the
[1:46:55] ghetto where the Christians were
[1:46:58] living. It was the only savior's
[1:47:04] place. They have few they have few sick
[1:47:07] people among them. Just like the same
[1:47:10] way we deal with uh uh uh uh co they
[1:47:14] have few sick people among them but
[1:47:17] because of the Christians uh the their
[1:47:21] community way of
[1:47:23] living and they were supporting one
[1:47:26] another and they were also praying for
[1:47:28] one
[1:47:30] another. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:33] Amen.
[1:47:35] Pretty soon uh uh Rome could not manage
[1:47:40] these people.
[1:47:43] They tried to shut them off. They tried
[1:47:45] to h black them but uh uh uh the the the
[1:47:49] church was still moving. So the only way
[1:47:52] that they thought that they they can
[1:47:53] conquer these people is to be part of
[1:47:55] them. Amen. Praise the Lord. The same
[1:47:59] way we have men that have creep in on a
[1:48:01] word. Yeah, praise the Lord. That's what
[1:48:04] the Bible says. Jude said that men that
[1:48:07] has creeped in
[1:48:09] unaware in the book of Acts. It was just
[1:48:11] like that. Simon the sorceress. Yeah. He
[1:48:15] would have became part of the church
[1:48:16] because he wanted power to heal.
[1:48:21] And Peter said, "You and your you and
[1:48:23] your witchcraft go to hell."
[1:48:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:29] It has always been like that. So pig in
[1:48:32] Rome became part of the church in
[1:48:38] Rome trying to tell the people and when
[1:48:41] they came in because they were great
[1:48:43] men. It was the Roman
[1:48:46] Empire. Can you imagine the governor of
[1:48:49] Minnesota coming to a good shepherd
[1:48:51] fellowship and when he comes he come
[1:48:53] with escort behind
[1:48:55] him. They they want the best seat in the
[1:48:58] church and then all his bowler guys are
[1:49:02] all of our church members will have to
[1:49:04] go in the fire
[1:49:07] because he needs security. So we give
[1:49:09] him security all the best seats and and
[1:49:12] that's that was just how they killed the
[1:49:14] effect of the truth church.
[1:49:19] All of these things of praying in one
[1:49:21] accord you're making noise. you just
[1:49:23] nominate one person to
[1:49:26] pray. But the original church from the
[1:49:29] book of Acts, the Bible says they pray
[1:49:32] in one accord.
[1:49:36] The the the the
[1:49:38] the uh uh uh apostolic church there, the
[1:49:42] people are singing. They are knocking
[1:49:43] their hands. They are knocking the wall
[1:49:45] and knocking CS and making music. That
[1:49:47] is not okay. We're going to bring grand
[1:49:50] piano.
[1:49:51] We'll bring one of the best Roman
[1:49:56] pianists. Okay. So, you know, the the
[1:50:00] the the
[1:50:01] the Romans, they like
[1:50:04] entertaining. They like to go to the
[1:50:06] circus and, you know, sit down. So, now
[1:50:08] what they're going to do is that we're
[1:50:11] going to make a choir that we
[1:50:14] sing because some of you just sing too
[1:50:16] fast. I mean, we can't catch up with our
[1:50:19] singing. So why not we bring a choir,
[1:50:22] you know, and in the choir we we give
[1:50:24] them a special seat and and and got to
[1:50:26] wear a gown. Everybody got to get a
[1:50:28] uniform.
[1:50:31] That's how they started killing the
[1:50:33] effect of the truth church. That's
[1:50:35] right. What were they using? They were
[1:50:37] using Roman power. Right. Amen.
[1:50:40] This is this is a Roman general being
[1:50:43] part of the church.
[1:50:45] So pretty soon the church and the state
[1:50:48] is emerging. Yeah. When the church want
[1:50:51] to do anything, they must not consult
[1:50:54] the state.
[1:50:58] Praise the Lord. Amen. This is not it's
[1:51:00] not hygienic for us to watch one another
[1:51:02] feet. How can we be watching slave feet?
[1:51:05] No. No. No. No. No. Y'all stop that.
[1:51:07] Y'all stop that. Y'all stop that. I mean
[1:51:09] all of these things here. Uh uh
[1:51:12] what you say communion? How they call
[1:51:15] it? Communion. Okay. What yall should do
[1:51:17] is that y'all make every individual own
[1:51:21] you know nobody coming to take their
[1:51:23] hand and break the bread and and uh no
[1:51:25] no no no no no so everybody get a little
[1:51:28] you just make it small small it's I mean
[1:51:30] for everybody you know I mean in that
[1:51:32] way we we got to be careful before we
[1:51:34] pass James to one another and
[1:51:38] uh praise the lord I mean why can't we
[1:51:41] just do the communal in the service in
[1:51:43] the morning why we have to go home and
[1:51:45] come back in the evening
[1:51:47] Again, if y'all say that it's just a a
[1:51:51] representation, I mean, let's let's just
[1:51:53] do it in one service
[1:52:00] before you realize
[1:52:02] things started changing.
[1:52:05] The Roman church started adopting those
[1:52:07] things. The people that were against it
[1:52:10] had to go out.
[1:52:14] That's right.
[1:52:16] The people that were against it have to
[1:52:18] go out. If you read church history, you
[1:52:21] realize that's when uh uh uh uh Aquelia
[1:52:25] and Piccelia move over to Ephesus
[1:52:28] because they were some of the minority
[1:52:30] that were in the church that were under
[1:52:32] persecution. They have to go
[1:52:34] out. when they say no this is not the
[1:52:37] way
[1:52:42] they now the the the kind of believers
[1:52:45] now saw it as the church is progressing
[1:52:49] the church is progressing I mean we uh
[1:52:52] the the general just said we're going to
[1:52:54] build a a big church we're going to get
[1:52:55] a good cathedral you know uh uh this
[1:52:58] little thing that we are in just like a
[1:53:00] bus you know uh so to then the church
[1:53:05] But
[1:53:07] but go back to to Daniel
[1:53:11] prophecy. How it was supposed to be was
[1:53:14] the clay and the iron was going to mix.
[1:53:18] Right? Amen. Amen. And if you read the
[1:53:21] Bible, the Bible says they were going to
[1:53:23] do what? Mingle their seed. Right. And
[1:53:26] what does that means? these young
[1:53:29] Christian women were going to be
[1:53:31] marrying pagan men because his father is
[1:53:35] a
[1:53:36] general. So if he come and ask for my
[1:53:39] daughter, I don't have much to say.
[1:53:42] He's not born again yet. Yeah. He still
[1:53:45] drinks wine. He still goes out there to
[1:53:48] the sacers and he does all of those
[1:53:49] things. They will mingle their seed. It
[1:53:53] started killing the effect
[1:53:55] and pretty soon the Holy Ghost has to
[1:53:58] back out. Amen.
[1:54:02] Are we together? Are you seeing the
[1:54:04] picture?
[1:54:08] Now, so we see here that uh that's when
[1:54:13] pagan Rome was converted to make papa
[1:54:16] room. Why are we in that denomination?
[1:54:18] That's where we're reading from. pagan
[1:54:20] room was converted and then it became
[1:54:23] papas which they had a pope in thestead
[1:54:28] of a king and the pope is the spiritual
[1:54:33] king. So that's how he's that's that's
[1:54:36] that's how he's seen that's the way he
[1:54:39] is. Praise the Lord. Are we together?
[1:54:43] Let's continue to read.
[1:54:45] And that is the
[1:54:48] reason he's a crown spiritual uh king
[1:54:53] claim to be the valker of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:57] The one that is in the place of Jesus
[1:55:00] Christ. That's how he's looked at.
[1:55:08] That's how he's looked at. One of the
[1:55:10] one of the biggest thing that came on
[1:55:12] the news uh uh uh was this was this
[1:55:15] little boy and I don't know about seven
[1:55:16] years old or so uh uh and and uh you
[1:55:20] know the uh Francis the Pope Francis let
[1:55:22] me let me be respectful the Pope Francis
[1:55:25] was good of going into you know the poor
[1:55:28] neighborhood he was very good that's the
[1:55:31] reason why uh his funeral was a bit uh
[1:55:34] you know extraordinary this weekend
[1:55:36] because he was not buried in a normal
[1:55:39] place that most of the pope was buried.
[1:55:40] He was buried out, you know, at another
[1:55:44] uh kind of a shelter, you know,
[1:55:46] community, but it's another cathedral
[1:55:47] somewhere, you know. So, he was out and
[1:55:49] this little boy came to him and, you
[1:55:52] know, and the little boy lost his dad
[1:55:55] and his dad was not a Christian. So, he
[1:55:57] wanted to ask the pope if his dad will
[1:55:59] be in heaven. It was it was a big thing
[1:56:02] and it's still now is a big thing
[1:56:05] because he's considered the man this is
[1:56:09] the man that is next to God on earth
[1:56:13] whatever he says
[1:56:15] [Music]
[1:56:16] sad and let it be
[1:56:23] done. Are we together? That's his
[1:56:26] office.
[1:56:30] That is his
[1:56:32] office. And now we are
[1:56:36] watching for who will be the next
[1:56:41] pope. That's what is important. Now
[1:56:43] watch and see why it's important. Let me
[1:56:45] let me I did too much talking here.
[1:56:48] Now a beast which was and which is now
[1:56:52] remember all of them will be deceived
[1:56:55] upon the earth whose name was not
[1:56:57] written in written from the foundation
[1:57:00] of the word. Are we together? Amen.
[1:57:04] Amen.
[1:57:05] Amen. Let's let's come down to here if
[1:57:08] if uh my young the folks can put up
[1:57:10] there the uh acts of the ask of the Holy
[1:57:13] Ghost. Let's let's take this one. Now,
[1:57:16] this this was what that drew me to this
[1:57:18] subject this morning as I was following
[1:57:21] all of these events. Let's read
[1:57:22] together. I believe one of these
[1:57:25] glorious
[1:57:26] day when this united confederation of
[1:57:31] churches goes
[1:57:33] together and the new pope is brought out
[1:57:37] of the United
[1:57:39] States and put
[1:57:42] over there I calling to prophecy.
[1:57:47] I call into prophecy. What is the
[1:57:50] prophecy?
[1:57:52] What is the prophecy now? Watch
[1:58:05] now. I believe one of these glorious
[1:58:07] days when when this United Confederation
[1:58:10] of Churches, which is the World Council
[1:58:12] of Churches, Amen. Where where does the
[1:58:16] World Council of Churches have their
[1:58:18] headquarter?
[1:58:20] Geneva. That's where they have their
[1:58:22] headquarter in Switzerland.
[1:58:25] That's where the World Council of
[1:58:26] Churches have their
[1:58:28] headquarter. But what is the police
[1:58:30] force of the World Council of
[1:58:33] Churches? United Nation. That's right.
[1:58:36] Where is their headquarter?
[1:58:39] New York.
[1:58:42] Now, so watch
[1:58:45] now. I believe one of these glorious day
[1:58:48] when this united confederation of
[1:58:51] churches goes together and the new pope
[1:58:53] is brought out of the United States. Now
[1:58:56] like again I'm saying don't say brother
[1:58:58] but won't say the pope is coming from
[1:59:01] America. That's not what I'm saying.
[1:59:05] Okay? That's not what I'm saying. That's
[1:59:08] not what I'm establishing to you. I'm
[1:59:10] only establishing to
[1:59:12] you a trend of what is to happen.
[1:59:18] Okay? Now, see where where it gets it
[1:59:22] gets important now.
[1:59:26] Amen. Are we together?
[1:59:31] Can we say amen? Amen. Okay. Now, so
[1:59:35] while this new pope is brought out of
[1:59:37] the United States and put over there
[1:59:39] according to prophecy, then there will
[1:59:42] form an
[1:59:43] image like unto the beast.
[1:59:49] What does that means?
[1:59:52] What does that means?
[1:59:54] It means that uh uh the like I said the
[1:59:58] police
[2:00:00] force the
[2:00:02] police of the world council of churches
[2:00:05] of this great system is the United
[2:00:08] Nation. Are we together? Amen. Okay. And
[2:00:12] uh so if if we have a a
[2:00:17] h a pope from the
[2:00:20] America, which
[2:00:22] means that uh we have
[2:00:27] uh let me say it this
[2:00:29] way. We have we have we will have power
[2:00:34] over both
[2:00:37] uh
[2:00:39] the the executive branch of the
[2:00:43] papac and also we will have the army of
[2:00:47] the
[2:00:47] papace. What I'm trying to say to you
[2:00:50] there is that now it becomes evident
[2:00:55] that we can now use the police to start
[2:00:58] to enforce
[2:01:02] Now the strength of the image of the
[2:01:04] beast will now comes visible. Right?
[2:01:08] That's what he's trying to say. That is
[2:01:11] the prophecy.
[2:01:14] Are we together? Amen. The image of the
[2:01:16] beast is already there. What is the
[2:01:19] image of the beast? Like mother, like
[2:01:21] daughters, right?
[2:01:23] Vatican is there. She has her influence
[2:01:26] over Geneva, right?
[2:01:29] She has her influence over who is placed
[2:01:32] down there as head of the World Council
[2:01:34] of Churches.
[2:01:42] Oh, sorry. This is not uh uh Jesus's
[2:01:45] love, but I'm telling you that God love
[2:01:46] you. Amen. Amen. He love you. Praise the
[2:01:50] Lord. And he has given you an
[2:01:52] opportunity that in your generation if
[2:01:55] you have not paid attention to this in
[2:01:58] your generation
[2:02:00] a pope will be elected few days
[2:02:07] no matter where he comes from.
[2:02:10] What is important is that we know that
[2:02:13] is a beast power from the bot
[2:02:16] that is leading to pedition.
[2:02:19] Amen.
[2:02:23] Are we together?
[2:02:30] The new pope is brought out of the
[2:02:32] United States. If that ever happened and
[2:02:34] put over there according to prophecy,
[2:02:37] then they will form the image like unto
[2:02:40] the beast. And I tell you, the true
[2:02:43] church of God will be drove together.
[2:02:47] Why? Because you will feel it. Yeah.
[2:02:50] Amen. You will feel it. They will shut
[2:02:52] down churches. Yeah. True. You will feel
[2:02:56] it. That's what he means.
[2:03:00] Now the true church will now be drawn
[2:03:03] together.
[2:03:06] But why should we wait for that to be
[2:03:08] drawn together? Amen. Amen. Why should
[2:03:11] we wait for that? Amen. Why should we
[2:03:14] wait for chaos to be drawn together when
[2:03:18] we have the opportunity to worship God
[2:03:21] under the liberty that we have the
[2:03:23] freedom we have? We can preach an hour
[2:03:25] and I think I've gone over an hour and
[2:03:27] always over an hour. Praise the Lord.
[2:03:30] Amen. We don't have to watch our back
[2:03:32] and see if the police is coming. When we
[2:03:35] have all of the liberty to do that, why
[2:03:38] can't we enjoy? Why not immerge ourself
[2:03:41] in it? Enjoy. get the benefit. Why
[2:03:44] should we wait for chaos before we start
[2:03:46] getting serious with God? That's right.
[2:03:52] Yeah.
[2:03:54] Praise the Lord. What it happened in our
[2:03:57] time is going to happen because it's the
[2:03:59] word of God. Revelation 13, Revelation
[2:04:02] 17, Revelation 18 tells us these things.
[2:04:06] Amen. Whether it happen now or later is
[2:04:10] going to happen.
[2:04:16] Are we together?
[2:04:20] So what? Why should we wait for
[2:04:23] that? I tell you the true church of God
[2:04:27] will be drove together the real true
[2:04:30] believers out of the Methodist Baptist
[2:04:34] Presbyterian. No matter what doctrine,
[2:04:36] no matter what doctrine you preach.
[2:04:38] Praise the Lord. when it really come to
[2:04:40] the place where where churches are shut
[2:04:42] down, you know, h places are closed down
[2:04:46] and and and you and you really want to
[2:04:49] worship God in spirit and truth and not
[2:04:51] just want to go to church for
[2:04:52] entertainment. Right. Right.
[2:04:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:02] The problem there is that we have a
[2:05:03] generation that just take the church to
[2:05:06] be a place of entertainment.
[2:05:10] they take it because uh I mean how many
[2:05:12] goes back and take and take their notes
[2:05:14] and go and says well we read from this
[2:05:16] place let me go and read it myself we
[2:05:18] don't do it we go through the door it's
[2:05:19] done we go with our own idea we get our
[2:05:22] program on our mind
[2:05:29] right why should we wait for
[2:05:36] that before we realize that we need to
[2:05:39] be in church h on time. We need to be in
[2:05:42] church before the doors open. We need to
[2:05:44] be in church on Wednesday. Why should we
[2:05:45] wait for that?
[2:05:49] Now we have the liberty while not grown
[2:05:52] ourself.
[2:05:56] And also expose our little ones. Yeah.
[2:06:05] Are we together? Amen. Like I said, I
[2:06:09] don't mean to make you afraid. The real
[2:06:11] true church will be drawn together. He
[2:06:14] says, uh, will go together and and and
[2:06:18] cemented by the love of God that will
[2:06:22] make the body of Jesus Christ. All the
[2:06:26] believers and uh, anostics and
[2:06:30] shadowminded will be cast to one side.
[2:06:36] Okay. Because there there are people
[2:06:38] like that. No matter no matter what you
[2:06:41] say, you can read it right from the
[2:06:43] Bible. They don't care.
[2:06:46] Yeah. They are so
[2:06:48] shallowminded that spiritual things
[2:06:50] don't appeal to them.
[2:06:53] Right. Their life is all about their own
[2:06:56] agenda.
[2:06:59] Spiritual things don't appeal to them.
[2:07:09] Are we together? Amen. Now, I can go I
[2:07:12] can go on and
[2:07:14] on. I can go on and
[2:07:17] on and and I mean if you you you try me,
[2:07:22] I'll keep you here until this
[2:07:24] evening because that's that's all that's
[2:07:27] all I was doing all through this
[2:07:29] week. I was just I was just looking And
[2:07:33] there there are a lot of things there
[2:07:35] that uh Wednesday night if the Lord
[2:07:37] allow us I want to I want to I want to
[2:07:40] speak on something here
[2:07:43] uh uh one hour
[2:07:46] uh becoming king one hour with the beast
[2:07:49] I want to I want to speak on that
[2:07:51] Wednesday night just for the prayer
[2:07:52] meeting. Uh so uh uh and and it just
[2:07:56] it's just all in sense. I don't want to
[2:07:58] put everything together this morning,
[2:08:01] but I mean that's what I want for us to
[2:08:03] be able to look
[2:08:05] at. What time are we living
[2:08:08] in? Like we said, Daniel got so
[2:08:12] concerned and when the devil realized
[2:08:15] that he was concerned, he blocked his
[2:08:19] heavens. He sent demon powers to to to
[2:08:24] to close his heaven. 21 days
[2:08:28] Daniel was laboring under there. Praise
[2:08:31] the Lord.
[2:08:33] I know uh uh you know, brother Crosby
[2:08:36] kept saying 23 days. Don't take it as
[2:08:38] false doctrine. Just take it as you
[2:08:40] know, human mistake. You know uh uh 21
[2:08:44] days.
[2:08:46] The heavens was closed. Why? Because the
[2:08:48] enemy never wanted him, the devil don't
[2:08:51] want him to get this reality.
[2:08:53] He just want our life to be filled with
[2:08:56] formality.
[2:08:59] Praise the Lord. Formality. We call
[2:09:01] ourselves believers but we far from the
[2:09:03] reality.
[2:09:05] We are believers in what? Right.
[2:09:08] What are we believers in? If we are
[2:09:10] believers in God, then let believe God
[2:09:12] every day.
[2:09:15] Yeah.
[2:09:19] Let it be reflected in our decision, in
[2:09:22] our choices. Let it be reflected in the
[2:09:25] things that we are doing.
[2:09:35] Are we together?
[2:09:43] Another friend.
[2:09:46] I don't know what this guy is thinking.
[2:09:47] Another friend of mine, I go to work and
[2:09:49] he says, he says, "Hey, I want to ask
[2:09:51] you what why were this what was that
[2:09:54] those people with the black gown and
[2:09:57] long black cap
[2:10:01] and I" I said, "Look, I never live in a
[2:10:03] Vic
[2:10:07] before. Praise the
[2:10:09] Lord." I said, "But let me let me let me
[2:10:12] let me bring you to some reality. You
[2:10:14] have to realize that this pope was a
[2:10:16] Jesuit.
[2:10:21] He was a Jesuit. That was the first
[2:10:23] Jesuit priest. I mean pope that we ever
[2:10:25] had. And uh and uh and uh the uh the
[2:10:31] Jesuit is a very very very strong
[2:10:34] powerful organization in the Catholic.
[2:10:37] Yeah.
