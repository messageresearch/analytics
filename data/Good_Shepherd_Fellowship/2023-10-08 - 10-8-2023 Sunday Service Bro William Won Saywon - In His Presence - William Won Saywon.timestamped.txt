[41:32] you in good
[41:34] health amen still pressing
[41:37] on and
[41:41] pushing the upward
[41:44] way because from one Sunday to another
[41:48] Sunday is a short
[41:51] time
[41:53] but it's also a long time
[41:57] praise the Lord amen it's enough
[42:00] time for the devil to do what he wants
[42:03] to
[42:04] do but praise be to
[42:07] God that we are not in this life by
[42:09] accident that's right we are here
[42:13] according to his Divine will amen and
[42:17] whether rain or shine We Shall Serve the
[42:20] purpose of God before we live
[42:22] here so don't think you are just another
[42:25] number or you are just another
[42:28] person that is why you don't have to try
[42:30] to be like somebody else just be
[42:32] yourself praise be to God I just want to
[42:36] take this opportunity to welcome every
[42:38] one of you than it's always heartwarming
[42:42] because when we leave on Sunday or
[42:44] Wednesday and we are coming back I mean
[42:46] you don't know what anybody's going
[42:48] through that's right there is a lot
[42:50] people go
[42:51] through it's just the grace of God that
[42:54] we walk through the doors with smiles on
[42:55] our face face and you don't know it amen
[42:59] but we know that there is a God who is
[43:01] working behind the scenes Hallelujah and
[43:03] God has not brought you this far only to
[43:06] turn his back on you praise God Amen the
[43:10] god that has brought you this far that
[43:13] God will see you
[43:14] through that is not in doubt we don't
[43:18] doubt that praise be to God hallelujah I
[43:23] want to take this opportunity to welcome
[43:25] the
[43:27] back from
[43:29] Liberia
[43:32] [Applause]
[43:35] amen yes it's good it's good to see you
[43:39] back um and I know I know uh we are all
[43:43] happy but I believe brother brother
[43:45] Lawrence will probably be
[43:48] happier yes because uh yes he he I mean
[43:53] he would come from work uh or he he'll
[43:56] be on his way to work and he will come
[43:58] and Lead songs before he goes I mean
[44:02] that was um a lot of sacrifice again for
[44:05] the love of God so um it's good to know
[44:10] that when you are jumping out of the
[44:11] parachute you are landing on two feet
[44:14] praise be to God yes so we have a
[44:18] brother in our midst brother
[44:21] Simon ATA please correct me if I'm wrong
[44:26] yes so let's welcome our brother to our
[44:33] M so this is the house of God Amen there
[44:37] are no strangers in our midst just feel
[44:40] free and enjoy the word of God praise
[44:44] God so
[44:46] um brother one and brother Jordan
[44:50] traveled um for some
[44:54] meetings um and there was supposed to be
[44:57] back this morning before service but on
[45:01] my way um I saw a text saying they
[45:04] wouldn't be able to make it in before
[45:07] the start of service you're welcome my
[45:10] brother and my
[45:11] sister yes
[45:14] um yes you're
[45:17] welcome praise the Lord hey yes welcome
[45:24] then
[45:27] yes I was telling the brother he should
[45:28] feel free we don't have strangers in the
[45:30] house of God this is the house of God so
[45:34] just feel free and enjoy the word praise
[45:36] the Lord yes so um he wouldn't be able
[45:40] to make it in before
[45:44] um hopefully they come in maybe during
[45:47] the course of the service I will not be
[45:49] surprised or maybe after the service
[45:50] whichever way God does it that will be
[45:53] good so remember them in your prayers
[45:56] and also um our brother who is going to
[46:00] be with the Lord Brother Jambi uh a
[46:02] little
[46:04] update
[46:06] um uh I just I I I I I I I I I was
[46:11] listening to the Sunday school and I
[46:14] thought that there could not have been a
[46:16] better time um for for that s say bless
[46:21] you uh God bless you
[46:24] siset uh it was very very
[46:27] timely uh when a a man dies shall he
[46:30] live again praise be to God We Shall
[46:33] Live Again by the grace of God he that
[46:36] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[46:38] shall he live amen praise be to God um
[46:42] it just dawn on me a few days ago that
[46:48] Ebola
[46:50] cancer um you can mention all those
[46:53] dangerous sicknesses they don't kill no
[46:56] sickness
[46:58] kills is when your purpose on Earth is
[47:01] done God calls you
[47:04] home because if we mention cancer there
[47:07] are people that have cancer and they are
[47:08] still
[47:09] alive people had Ebola they are still
[47:12] alive people had coid 19 they are still
[47:15] alive when God is not done with you you
[47:19] will be here but when God is done with
[47:21] you you just go home our brother is gone
[47:25] home home amen and we shall see again
[47:29] amen but regarding when his barrier or
[47:32] the barrier of remains is going to be
[47:35] the family has
[47:37] decided they are going to bury him
[47:40] November
[47:42] 25th if anything changes we'll let the
[47:46] church know but for now the family has
[47:49] agree to bury him on the 25th day of
[47:54] November so so uh there's supposed to be
[47:57] a meeting today this
[48:00] evening um they may postpone the meeting
[48:03] we are supposed to be part of the
[48:05] meeting I mean brother one and myself if
[48:07] he comes we'll go in for the meeting and
[48:09] then uh bring you the updates if he
[48:12] doesn't come uh the meeting will be
[48:14] postponed because the family wants us to
[48:16] be there uh then we'll get you guys uh
[48:19] everybody uh up to date
[48:23] so um we'll ask you to continue to pray
[48:28] for uh sis bever and uh her
[48:33] sisters um the immediate in the extended
[48:36] family because it's a difficult time uh
[48:40] for them
[48:42] yes there is no doubt praise be to
[48:47] God

[1:10:16] seed this morning by the grace of God we
[1:10:18] want to speak on the subject in his
[1:10:22] presence
[1:10:27] the presence of God is everywhere and
[1:10:30] it's a great privilege to always be in
[1:10:32] the presence of the Lord amen in the
[1:10:36] presence of
[1:10:37] God men recognize thems to be
[1:10:43] Sinners whenever the presence of God
[1:10:46] comes
[1:10:47] down you can see
[1:10:51] yourself hallelujah amen sometime we
[1:10:54] feel good when we are out in different
[1:10:59] places and we move around maybe at our
[1:11:03] job side or when we are at school or
[1:11:06] even in our
[1:11:07] house we think that we are good in
[1:11:12] ourself as human
[1:11:14] being but when we come in the Pres of
[1:11:18] God then we can see how little we
[1:11:22] are
[1:11:24] one time B brahan and his friends went
[1:11:30] out they went
[1:11:32] out and they went on the haunting
[1:11:36] trip so baham and his friends stood in
[1:11:40] the forest and they were looking at the
[1:11:46] waterfall and the water were pulling
[1:11:48] down from the mountain with force and
[1:11:51] power hitting the Rock
[1:11:55] and the brother who stood by the
[1:11:58] prophet look at the waterfall so
[1:12:02] much until he turned to the prophet he
[1:12:05] said wow brother
[1:12:07] Abraham see the way how the water is
[1:12:10] pulling
[1:12:11] down that is God
[1:12:15] creation if a man look at it so much
[1:12:18] they feel so little in the presence of
[1:12:22] God so brother Braham look at him and
[1:12:24] say yes that is
[1:12:27] true then brother Braham
[1:12:29] said he said the how he
[1:12:35] felt in the presence of God when he saw
[1:12:39] God
[1:12:41] creation he fell little within
[1:12:45] himself one time about
[1:12:48] Braham he was standing with B
[1:12:51] wood and another
[1:12:54] brother and they were measuring the
[1:12:57] stars in the
[1:12:59] air and brother
[1:13:02] Braham and these brothers deci started
[1:13:04] to look at the stars so much how close
[1:13:08] they were so close together you know
[1:13:12] during the night hour when you come out
[1:13:14] sometime you look in the sky and you see
[1:13:16] how the stars are all close together so
[1:13:20] brother brahan was looking at
[1:13:22] them and then rest of the the brothers
[1:13:24] they were all looking at the stars and
[1:13:26] they were measuring it according to
[1:13:29] scientist how we are far away from them
[1:13:31] millions or Millions miles away from the
[1:13:36] Stars so brother bran said he said when
[1:13:41] you see these things and scientist said
[1:13:44] that the Stars they are far away from
[1:13:49] each other Millions miles away from each
[1:13:52] other
[1:13:53] like the way how we are far away from
[1:13:56] them so brother said he said then we
[1:14:00] human he say we realize how little we
[1:14:05] are because it say see us how close we
[1:14:10] comes in God
[1:14:12] presence we got out here this morning
[1:14:15] and the presence of God is around us so
[1:14:17] much so close to us that we might not
[1:14:21] see him with our Naked Eyes eyes but we
[1:14:24] feel his
[1:14:27] pres
[1:14:30] Hallelujah brother said one time he said
[1:14:33] even during his
[1:14:35] ministry he said when he's praying for
[1:14:39] people and people are onl and the
[1:14:43] passing by him laying hands upon them he
[1:14:46] said the person of God can descend so
[1:14:49] much among the people until some can
[1:14:53] drop from the lamb and run to the Altar
[1:14:57] and confess that sin and start to cry
[1:15:01] because of the presence of
[1:15:04] God B talk about the about the Mexican
[1:15:09] woman who came with a dead baby he said
[1:15:13] there were
[1:15:14] 75,000 people that were dead when he was
[1:15:19] preaching he said and that lady came
[1:15:22] with a dead baby
[1:15:26] and the presence of God came down so
[1:15:29] much until brother Braham before the
[1:15:32] letter could come to him he already S A
[1:15:36] Vision about that little child that
[1:15:41] baby and the little King with the child
[1:15:45] right before the prophet and the vision
[1:15:48] broke for and brother Brian said in the
[1:15:50] vision he saw that little child
[1:15:55] smiling and the brother Abraham Just
[1:15:57] prayed a little prayer and the child
[1:16:00] came back to
[1:16:02] life and brother brah
[1:16:05] said women
[1:16:07] fainted and people scam with
[1:16:11] joy why because they knew that that
[1:16:15] couldn't be
[1:16:16] men that was God and they knew that they

[1:18:27] when when the man descended and touched
[1:18:29] the bones of elishah the power of the
[1:18:34] power of God will stay in their
[1:18:39] bones and the Bible said the dead man
[1:18:42] came back to
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:47] life praise the
[1:18:49] Lord
[1:18:51] today the power of of God is stayed
[1:18:54] around the perfect
[1:18:58] grave even if you are sick and you have
[1:19:01] faith enough and you trust God and say
[1:19:04] Lord if I touch the grave of your
[1:19:07] servant I will be made whole I'm telling
[1:19:10] you the supernatural power of God will
[1:19:12] touch you and you will be
[1:19:15] healed I went there and I just L over
[1:19:18] the
[1:19:19] grave and someone saw it and said look
[1:19:22] at this brother lying on the
[1:19:26] grave I just
[1:19:29] laugh I said Lord my brother so I just
[1:19:31] read I just read a comment I said let me
[1:19:34] tell you
[1:19:35] something maybe we may not see ey to
[1:19:38] ey but there's something about that
[1:19:41] grave
[1:19:43] am
[1:19:45] Hallelujah there's something about the
[1:19:47] prophet
[1:19:49] grave in his
[1:19:51] presence
[1:19:56] when Adam
[1:19:59] sin when he knew that he had done
[1:20:01] something
[1:20:05] wrong when he came in the presence of
[1:20:07] God you know Adam when Adam sinned
[1:20:09] against God the Bible say Adam run and
[1:20:12] he hide himself in the
[1:20:16] bushes when the Pres of God you know in
[1:20:19] the C of the day the Bible say in the C
[1:20:21] of the day the Lord will come done and
[1:20:23] God will have fellowship with them but
[1:20:26] this time around Adam did something that
[1:20:30] was
[1:20:31] wrong and he couldn't come in the
[1:20:33] presence of God so the Bible say when
[1:20:37] you heard the voice of God in the garden
[1:20:40] Adam rain and he hide
[1:20:43] yourself why because he se he did
[1:20:47] something wrong he couldn't come in the
[1:20:49] presence of the
[1:20:51] Lord
[1:20:54] brother said he said that was the
[1:20:56] reaction of the first
[1:20:58] man when he sinned against God he
[1:21:02] couldn't come in the presence of God
[1:21:04] brother say he was conscient enough he
[1:21:08] was so conscient about the presence of
[1:21:10] God so much until he have to hide
[1:21:13] himself but abrah said he remained there
[1:21:16] until God make way for
[1:21:20] him hallelujah amen B said that was Adam
[1:21:24] in the presence of
[1:21:26] God talk about
[1:21:29] Abraham he said Abraham who served God
[1:21:32] for 25 years
[1:21:35] Faithfully he said
[1:21:38] Abraham when God moved in his pres in
[1:21:41] Genesis chapter 17 he said when God
[1:21:44] moved in Abraham pres when he s God B
[1:21:49] say he fell and he bow down to the
[1:21:51] ground
[1:21:53] because he was in the presence of the
[1:21:56] Lord faithful Abraham he couldn't stand
[1:22:00] God
[1:22:02] presence say although you serve God for
[1:22:05] 25
[1:22:06] years said look at
[1:22:10] Moses he said Moses the great servant of
[1:22:14] God he said Moses was born to deliver
[1:22:20] God
[1:22:21] people
[1:22:23] he said but Moses with all the training
[1:22:25] he had in Egypt until he had wisdom so
[1:22:30] much until but Abraham said he could
[1:22:32] teach the Egyptian wisdom he said he was
[1:22:35] trained so much he said but with all the
[1:22:39] training in had until he even know the
[1:22:41] scripture from A to Z he said but he
[1:22:45] understood it by theological stand Point
[1:22:49] amen with all that training so he
[1:22:53] thought he could deliver God people by
[1:22:56] his own military power but you know what
[1:22:59] God cannot share his glory with
[1:23:04] anyone so he tried to do it but when he
[1:23:07] tried to do it he got into trouble look
[1:23:09] at
[1:23:10] Moses he just killed one person in Egypt
[1:23:14] he got in trouble you have to
[1:23:17] escape but look how God open the Red Sea
[1:23:21] and the whole home
[1:23:24] of the Egyptian Army God drown them in
[1:23:27] the sea amen no one say anything against
[1:23:33] him
[1:23:36] Hallelujah see how God is so
[1:23:41] great so
[1:23:44] Moses when he escaped then God decided
[1:23:47] to attract the attention let me tell you
[1:23:50] something God get the weight of his
[1:23:53] children the way how you came to the
[1:23:56] message is different from the way I came
[1:23:58] to the
[1:23:59] message every one of us God call us
[1:24:02] different different way to come to
[1:24:07] him somebody maybe someone just gave you
[1:24:10] a s book by you reading this something
[1:24:13] scra your
[1:24:14] heart maybe someone just invite you say
[1:24:17] oh brother sister you can visit my
[1:24:19] church but you just come in your first
[1:24:21] service on this your
[1:24:24] heart Hallelujah am maybe you saw
[1:24:27] someone preaching and through the
[1:24:29] preaching something scra your heart
[1:24:32] different different ways but look at
[1:24:34] Moses god attracted your
[1:24:36] attention he s a bush on
[1:24:39] fire and he was looking at the bush so
[1:24:42] much he said but understand I can't
[1:24:44] understand the kind of
[1:24:46] sight this bush is
[1:24:49] burning but the bush is not consumed
[1:24:53] there's a fire on the bush but the the
[1:24:56] tree is still green and it is not
[1:24:59] consumed so he said let me draw closer
[1:25:02] to see the great sight so that was God
[1:25:06] calling
[1:25:07] him
[1:25:10] Hallelujah the Bible say when when he
[1:25:12] draw closer in the presence of the Lord
[1:25:15] Moses couldn't stand in the presence of
[1:25:17] God he have to take his Sonos from his
[1:25:20] feet why because he were in the presence
[1:25:24] of the
[1:25:26] Lord praise the
[1:25:29] Lord B say he was born to be the
[1:25:32] prophet
[1:25:37] Moses said in Exodus chapter 20 he said
[1:25:41] one time God told Moses he said Gather
[1:25:44] the children of
[1:25:46] Israel GA than around
[1:25:50] Mas so Moses gathered them and God
[1:25:54] decided to come down to speak to the
[1:25:57] children of
[1:25:59] Israel but the children of Israel
[1:26:01] couldn't stand the presence of the
[1:26:04] Lord when God started to descend on the
[1:26:07] mountain the mountain cut fires
[1:26:11] tles they couldn't stand it they said
[1:26:15] Moses you speak to us
[1:26:19] amen they were standing in the presence
[1:26:21] of God the who stand the presence of
[1:26:24] God they say if if God speak to us we
[1:26:27] all perish you speak to
[1:26:32] us
[1:26:34] hallelujah this morning we are in God
[1:26:38] presence but if you are not in the
[1:26:41] spirit you will only be seeing men you
[1:26:44] will only be seeing people with f cloth

[1:31:59] Candlestick
[1:32:01] Hallelujah when he saw Jesus Jesus who

[1:32:20] will be something that would take place
[1:32:22] in
[1:32:26] Us Praise the Lord am we talk we read
[1:32:30] about King yah in the
[1:32:33] Bible King yah was a shepher Bo in the
[1:32:37] day of
[1:32:40] Isaiah the prophet and you had a great
[1:32:43] influence on Isaiah the Bible said you
[1:32:46] don't put your covidence in any
[1:32:49] man he trusted you see so much Le on
[1:32:58] him just like I was preaching one one
[1:33:00] one time I was telling the church I said
[1:33:03] if this is God and I come in I hold this
[1:33:07] I'm holding to God and you my friend you
[1:33:10] can be my wife or you can be my child
[1:33:13] and if you come and hold me as long I
[1:33:16] holding to God it mean you are holding
[1:33:17] to God you said then I said but the day
[1:33:21] I I leave God it may you yourself you
[1:33:24] also leave God because you are holy
[1:33:28] men praise the Lord he said but I said
[1:33:32] but if I am holding to God and you come
[1:33:35] on the other side and you are holding to
[1:33:37] God the day I live God you yourself will
[1:33:40] still beholding
[1:33:45] God but with Isaiah his covenent his
[1:33:49] whole trust were in use yet so much
[1:33:53] until when you had left God he felt
[1:33:59] discouraged there was no hope in
[1:34:02] him he was so confused he don't know
[1:34:05] what to
[1:34:06] do and brother said
[1:34:10] you he was 16 years old the Bible said
[1:34:13] he was 16 years old a little B when God
[1:34:16] make it King God LIF him
[1:34:18] up when God lift you up you are
[1:34:22] great but when you try to lift yourself
[1:34:25] up Pride go Before
[1:34:29] Destruction so 16 years old God make a
[1:34:32] king B said God protected him so much
[1:34:36] the Bible said God built his kingdom
[1:34:39] brother said his kingdom was next to
[1:34:42] King
[1:34:43] Solomon God protected him he was so
[1:34:47] seced God got him but you know what the
[1:34:50] Bible said can
[1:34:52] use f so
[1:34:56] much he felt that understand nothing
[1:35:01] could shake him he felt so proud until
[1:35:04] he was lifted
[1:35:07] up when he was lifted up with pride the
[1:35:10] Bible said then God left
[1:35:12] him because God hit the spirit of
[1:35:16] Pride every child of God the more you go
[1:35:19] up the more you become humble
[1:35:23] praise the Lord so he F so proud until
[1:35:28] you know what he left his god-given
[1:35:32] position god making King and when God
[1:35:35] make you King we in your position as a
[1:35:41] king so he left his King position and he
[1:35:45] ran into the temple to bring incense
[1:35:48] then the priest went to him and told him
[1:35:50] that oh left forever with all due
[1:35:53] respect this is not your
[1:35:57] place but the Bible
[1:35:59] said if know the pride was in him so
[1:36:04] much brother Brown say anyone that hate
[1:36:08] correction and said that is not the
[1:36:09] spirit of
[1:36:11] God when you are corrected and then you
[1:36:15] feel
[1:36:16] offended he said then you need to check
[1:36:19] your
[1:36:20] spirit
[1:36:27] Hallelujah the minister R to him and
[1:36:30] said K this is not your job you go
[1:36:34] angry people hit people hit corruption
[1:36:38] there are people who just hit corruption
[1:36:41] so while the King was stay in his anger
[1:36:45] then go strike
[1:36:49] him he were taking
[1:36:51] from the temple from that time isah got
[1:36:55] confused because he was depending on the
[1:36:58] king so
[1:36:59] much then he went to
[1:37:03] church in the temple he sat down then
[1:37:07] the worship was on service was going
[1:37:12] on just sitting at the back worshiping
[1:37:15] God while the worship was going on then
[1:37:18] the presence of God came down in the
[1:37:20] church
[1:37:22] then the Lord open his
[1:37:24] eyes for the first
[1:37:27] time asaiah saw the supernatural power
[1:37:31] of God in the
[1:37:33] temple hallelujah amen he saw angels
[1:37:37] flying with six wings he couldn't
[1:37:40] believe
[1:37:43] him he couldn't believe his eyes in the
[1:37:46] presence of God I'm telling you when you
[1:37:49] come to church and the presence of God
[1:37:53] that comes down always in the among the
[1:37:55] children of God if you are if you are in
[1:37:58] the spirit so much God can open your
[1:38:00] eyes to see the angels in the
[1:38:05] church brother Brown said he said
[1:38:07] sometime God can even open your eyes and
[1:38:09] you can be seeing Vision while the next
[1:38:11] person side you can't be seeing
[1:38:15] anything sometime if God not even give
[1:38:18] you Grace you'll be seeing your own P PR
[1:38:20] to you understand you only be admiring
[1:38:24] him a SCH that oh see a nice SCH I I
[1:38:28] enjoy his time yes our our pastor can
[1:38:31] dress well you
[1:38:33] understand and all the preaching will
[1:38:36] just be passing over you you will not
[1:38:38] get anything from the
[1:38:40] preaching because when you come to
[1:38:42] church you see the sister that dress
[1:38:44] nice you see the brothers that dress
[1:38:46] nice but you don't come to get something
[1:38:49] from God
[1:38:52] because when you come for service with
[1:38:53] when you come to church with that mind
[1:38:56] to receive from
[1:38:58] God you don't care who is the next
[1:39:01] person set inside
[1:39:04] you you only worship your God and you
[1:39:07] say God I'm going to church say
[1:39:10] something to
[1:39:13] me and that service will always start
[1:39:15] from the
[1:39:17] house our services begin from the house
[1:39:21] because when you come to church when the
[1:39:23] worship is going on you will not be
[1:39:25] thinking about the next person out you
[1:39:27] whether they are sinking whether they
[1:39:28] not sinking whether they're dancing
[1:39:30] whether they not dancing you don't
[1:39:36] care praise the Lord your mind will only
[1:39:39] be on God because when we come to church
[1:39:43] we are here for two things God will
[1:39:46] either encourage you or discourage
[1:39:50] you when you are a child of God who is
[1:39:52] pressing forward and the Lord is seeing
[1:39:55] you and when the preaching come that
[1:39:58] will be just a encouragement to you that
[1:40:00] oh my son my daughter keep pressing
[1:40:03] on just like the just like the prophet
[1:40:06] brother abah when you saw when you went
[1:40:09] in the dimension that why they to him
[1:40:11] say keep pressing
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:15] on Hallelujah the angel told keep
[1:40:18] pressing so when you come to church
[1:40:20] understand and the Lord see you that yes
[1:40:23] you are consecrating your life so much
[1:40:26] in the presence of God you consecrating
[1:40:29] your life because God sees us everywhere
[1:40:33] we go there's an unseen ad watching
[1:40:37] us so even when you are at
[1:40:40] work or you are even at
[1:40:44] home the angel of the Lord is recording
[1:40:47] your
[1:40:49] life God know all about us now we come
[1:40:54] to church you don't know what is in my
[1:40:56] heart I don't know what is in your heart
[1:40:58] but God know every one of our heart God
[1:41:02] God know all those who are pressing
[1:41:04] forward God know all the weak
[1:41:08] Believers God even know those that never
[1:41:10] even prayed this morning before coming
[1:41:12] to
[1:41:14] church Hallelujah so God know us and we
[1:41:17] are in the presence of
[1:41:19] God so when the presence of God come
[1:41:22] down so much sometime your own cons
[1:41:24] begin to judge you that oh yes oh you
[1:41:27] are my daughter you are my son but you
[1:41:28] are not doing
[1:41:30] well you need to do more so when you
[1:41:34] come to church understand and you are
[1:41:36] not straight the spirit of God will
[1:41:39] discourage you that if the Rapture takes

[1:47:14] he said we don't have wings to cover our
[1:47:17] faces he said but we have the blood
[1:47:22] the blood of Jesus that cover us so we
[1:47:26] are covered with the
[1:47:27] blood oh I'm telling you the devil

[1:47:44] Sin he see the red blood of
[1:47:48] Jesus so we are white so we look pure in
[1:47:52] the eyes of
[1:47:53] God because because when whenever Jesus
[1:47:57] Christ tried to look us to look at us he
[1:48:00] pass his eyes through the red blood of
[1:48:03] Jesus before he see us then we are
[1:48:08] covered why because when we sin we
[1:48:12] confess our
[1:48:14] sin then God take it from his
[1:48:17] membran God erase it
[1:48:22] there's no way that God can remember
[1:48:26] it
[1:48:29] Hallelujah but say he take it and you
[1:48:31] put it in the sea or forgetfulness you
[1:48:34] don't think about it again he said but
[1:48:37] that we because we are human sometime
[1:48:40] when you do something to me or I did
[1:48:43] something to you he said you can forgive
[1:48:45] me and I can forgive you he said but we
[1:48:48] can still remember amen amen we can
[1:48:51] still remember oh brother you did
[1:48:53] something to me before although I have
[1:48:55] forgave you but I can still
[1:48:59] remember so when Jesus Christ even said
[1:49:03] forgive 490 times we are not
[1:49:07] going we human some you did it the first
[1:49:11] time yes don't do it
[1:49:13] again Jesus said 490 time but the man
[1:49:17] did it one time now he talking but don't
[1:49:20] do it again no you still have more time
[1:49:23] to forgive that
[1:49:28] person praise the Lord so you see so you
[1:49:32] see there so we are human so we always
[1:49:35] remember people
[1:49:39] s and sometime when our heart is so
[1:49:41] wicked you understand things that God
[1:49:45] have already
[1:49:47] forgiven in the life of a brother all of
[1:49:50] a sister then we want to go for a on the
[1:49:55] blood to take it from there and bring it
[1:49:59] up God hit that spirit amen that when
[1:50:02] God forgive somebody then you want to go
[1:50:05] for it and bring it say look this
[1:50:08] brother this this this sister this this
[1:50:10] no God hate that
[1:50:14] spirit because when you are filled with
[1:50:16] the Holy
[1:50:17] Ghost that Spirit can never C around you
[1:50:22] am but when you are not filled with the
[1:50:25] spirit of
[1:50:26] God I'm telling you you will always
[1:50:29] remember people
[1:50:30] sin you will always see people let
[1:50:36] Sinners
[1:50:37] yes even in the church you will start to
[1:50:40] choose the I don't believe will be the
[1:50:42] Rapture the this not be the
[1:50:47] Rapture and who are you
[1:50:53] you never die for my
[1:50:55] sin Jesus Christ died for
[1:51:00] me
[1:51:02] yes only Jesus Christ can
[1:51:06] determine only Jesus Christ know my
[1:51:11] destiny nobody can do that
[1:51:14] am praise the Lord amen no one died for
[1:51:18] you Jesus Christ died for
[1:51:20] us and the heaven that we are going to
[1:51:23] that heaven is done for me the heaven is
[1:51:26] done for you the heaven belong to Jesus
[1:51:29] amen so it is Jesus who is carrying his
[1:51:32] children to Heaven am sometime the
[1:51:36] person that you feel that will don't be
[1:51:37] in the Rapture that the person will be
[1:51:39] in the
[1:51:41] Rapture so sometime the person who you
[1:51:43] looking at already in the Rapture maybe
[1:51:46] that person is not going in the
[1:51:48] rapture because in the church said there
[1:51:51] are always three kind of Believers right
[1:51:54] three kinds of
[1:51:57] Believers all you have to do forget
[1:51:59] about what this brother going the
[1:52:01] Rapture or what sister going in the
[1:52:03] Rapture focus on
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:09] yourself salvation is individual
[1:52:12] Affair all you can do for me is to pray
[1:52:15] for me just pray for me and I pray for
[1:52:19] you amen
[1:52:24] am and you focus on yourself make sure
[1:52:27] that you have the Holy
[1:52:29] Ghost because without the Holy Ghost you
[1:52:31] will not go into
[1:52:36] Rapture in his
[1:52:38] presence
[1:52:42] hallelujah praise the
[1:52:45] Lord oh my god brother said he said
[1:52:49] people don't reverence God he said they
[1:52:52] don't realize that they are in
[1:52:55] ispr everywhere say everywhere we are in
[1:52:58] his presence you know that sometime
[1:53:00] there are other people who can have
[1:53:02] their identity there are other believers
[1:53:05] who can have their
[1:53:07] identification that is typical example
[1:53:11] if you work somewhere you don't want for
[1:53:13] people to know who you are and when you
[1:53:16] try to do that you see yourself
[1:53:18] compromising amen if you work somewhere
[1:53:22] and you are among group of unbelievers
[1:53:24] and you working along with them you need
[1:53:27] to tell them that you are a born again
[1:53:29] believer you need to tell them who you
[1:53:32] are and what you stand

[2:12:14] not depart from here they will not
[2:12:17] depart from that training but say the
[2:12:20] best gift we can give them that Jesus
[2:12:22] Christ
[2:12:24] yeah there was a man who was dying and
[2:12:28] on his dying bed he call his children
[2:12:30] say come all the children came around
[2:12:33] and said you see me I'm dying but I

[2:13:23] there he said never you try to go the
[2:13:26] downward
