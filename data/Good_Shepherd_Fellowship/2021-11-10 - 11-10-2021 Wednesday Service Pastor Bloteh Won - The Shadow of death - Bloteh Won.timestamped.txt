[1:04:31] but scared was so
[1:04:33] special in a way that is hard to be like
[1:04:35] him amen
[1:04:38] it's hard to be like him you can
[1:04:39] impersonate him
[1:04:41] he was one of his kind
[1:04:44] tonight i want to share the uh just a
[1:04:47] few quotes with you from the prophet of
[1:04:48] god tonight talking about uh uh uh
[1:04:52] what david said that in the psalm
[1:04:58] close my bible here
[1:05:01] but we know that david said
[1:05:03] in the psalm though i walk through the
[1:05:05] valley
[1:05:06] of the shadow of death
[1:05:10] i would fear no evil
[1:05:15] for that i would mean that wrought in
[1:05:16] that staff they comfort me
[1:05:19] i want to talk about the shadow of death
[1:05:24] tonight
[1:05:26] praise the lord
[1:05:27] i want to pick up
[1:05:29] just a few thoughts from brother branham
[1:05:31] and talks about the shadow of death
[1:05:35] brother branham over and over said uh uh
[1:05:37] he taught us
[1:05:39] you know people said though i walk
[1:05:41] through the dark shadow of death he says
[1:05:44] that's a very wrong
[1:05:46] interpretation
[1:05:48] death is not a dark shadow
[1:05:52] death is a shadow
[1:05:54] and shadow
[1:05:57] a shadow is made
[1:06:01] when there is
[1:06:04] setting the mount of light
[1:06:06] in a certain amount of darkness
[1:06:08] a shadow cannot be cast
[1:06:11] if it is just all light
[1:06:15] praise the lord
[1:06:17] shadow cannot be cast
[1:06:19] if it is completely dark
[1:06:22] for you to cast a shadow
[1:06:25] there have to be
[1:06:26] a certain amount of light in a certain
[1:06:28] amount of darkness
[1:06:31] for a shadow to be cast
[1:06:33] the bible says the old testament the
[1:06:36] lord was a shadow of good things to come
[1:06:39] so the lord the old testament or the
[1:06:42] lord
[1:06:43] had
[1:06:44] an amount
[1:06:46] of light
[1:06:48] that could never come to fullness
[1:06:51] until our lord jesus the light of the
[1:06:53] world came
[1:06:55] that's why he said i never came to
[1:06:56] destroy the lord
[1:06:58] but i came to fulfill them
[1:07:00] praise the lord
[1:07:02] all of
[1:07:03] the things that were clouded in the law
[1:07:06] that we could not understand
[1:07:08] jesus came to bring them to light
[1:07:11] praise the lord
[1:07:13] so
[1:07:14] we we want to just talk a little bit
[1:07:16] tonight and and i will take
[1:07:19] a quote of brother branham a year from
[1:07:22] from the adoption series
[1:07:26] he said yeah
[1:07:28] uh
[1:07:30] uh
[1:07:31] he started talking about this in the
[1:07:32] adoption series he says
[1:07:34] you begin your internal life
[1:07:37] right here at the altar
[1:07:41] years where
[1:07:42] you start eternity
[1:07:46] praise the lord
[1:07:48] oh you start internal life right here
[1:07:56] then
[1:07:58] you are born again as son of god
[1:08:01] and then when you die
[1:08:04] when your death strikes you in this body
[1:08:08] and your heart quits beating
[1:08:13] and the mortal wheels begin to stand
[1:08:15] still
[1:08:18] that little shadow
[1:08:21] that was a shadow of shadow
[1:08:27] in one second
[1:08:29] it becomes
[1:08:31] a shadow
[1:08:33] of the shadow
[1:08:36] then the next it becomes
[1:08:39] the shadow
[1:08:41] then the next
[1:08:43] it becomes
[1:08:45] a little
[1:08:47] twinkle
[1:08:49] then the next
[1:08:51] it becomes a creek
[1:08:56] then the next it becomes a river
[1:09:01] then the next it becomes
[1:09:04] the ocean
[1:09:06] and after a while
[1:09:09] you are standing
[1:09:11] in the presence
[1:09:13] of your loved ones
[1:09:16] standing
[1:09:17] younger
[1:09:20] the lord
[1:09:21] now it happened so quick
[1:09:25] like the bible says in the twinkling of
[1:09:27] an eye
[1:09:29] but that's that's the journey you takes
[1:09:33] when you are born again
[1:09:36] praise the lord
[1:09:38] because when you are born again
[1:09:41] that's that's where
[1:09:44] your internal life begins and that's
[1:09:46] where
[1:09:47] death hits you
[1:09:51] praise the lord
[1:09:52] amen
[1:09:55] so after you know uh uh
[1:09:58] i've i have a i have a message
[1:10:01] that i'm now preaching and still looking
[1:10:03] for where to preach it and when to
[1:10:05] preach it
[1:10:06] that i entitle
[1:10:08] the pulpit
[1:10:09] it's just a tombstone
[1:10:12] when you go to the grave you see many
[1:10:14] graves just like this
[1:10:16] a cross
[1:10:18] with a tombstone
[1:10:23] because this is the place where many of
[1:10:26] us are buried
[1:10:30] praise the lord
[1:10:32] that's the reason why never never fish
[1:10:34] him to run to the altar
[1:10:37] because this is your grave
[1:10:41] praise the lord
[1:10:43] the pulpit is just a tombstone
[1:10:47] every time we come to service
[1:10:49] we're looking for the opportunity to
[1:10:51] have another funeral
[1:10:55] where somebody will be ready to die to
[1:10:57] themselves die to their pride
[1:11:00] die to the arrogance
[1:11:02] come to the altar
[1:11:06] praise the lord living in an age where
[1:11:08] people young people feel so ashamed to
[1:11:10] come to the altar
[1:11:16] but brother bram says that's where your
[1:11:18] internal life begins right here peter
[1:11:21] said
[1:11:22] judgment begins in the house of god
[1:11:26] he says if the righteous will be
[1:11:28] scarcely saved where where the sinners
[1:11:30] and the ungodly appear
[1:11:35] praise the lord
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:47] brother scott
[1:11:49] and his wife way back many years in the
[1:11:52] seventh days these are people that have
[1:11:54] been walking with this message
[1:11:58] from way back in the 70s
[1:12:04] you think about it
[1:12:08] and even with his age he never found an
[1:12:10] excuse to stay away from church
[1:12:25] you begin your internal life right here
[1:12:27] at the altar
[1:12:29] years were
[1:12:30] you start eternity
[1:12:33] all you start internal life right here
[1:12:35] then
[1:12:36] you are born again as son of god
[1:12:40] praise the lord
[1:12:42] many christians
[1:12:44] are looking for their internal life when
[1:12:46] they die
[1:12:49] praise the lord
[1:12:53] but we know by the new birth
[1:12:56] not just a simple confession
[1:13:00] but the new birth
[1:13:04] that brings you
[1:13:09] to separation
[1:13:12] amen
[1:13:14] begins internal life
[1:13:17] in your body
[1:13:22] praise the lord but as brother branham
[1:13:24] is saying it here that eternal life
[1:13:27] you have it in a shadow form
[1:13:32] it's in the shadow form
[1:13:36] that's the reason why sometimes
[1:13:39] you are on fire for god and sometimes
[1:13:41] you are you are you are you you are you
[1:13:44] are angry you are depressed
[1:13:46] you are disappointed
[1:13:49] you you you you go through trials you
[1:13:53] get sick
[1:13:54] because you only have it in the shadow
[1:13:57] form
[1:14:00] praise the lord
[1:14:03] amen
[1:14:04] sometimes you go through some things in
[1:14:06] life and you ask you you you you wanna
[1:14:08] in your mind am i ready safe
[1:14:15] it's because you have it in a shadow
[1:14:18] form
[1:14:20] praise the lord and as you starts to go
[1:14:23] like brother branham says somewhere
[1:14:25] there he says it's just like a little
[1:14:27] button
[1:14:30] a deposit
[1:14:32] that quicken in your soul
[1:14:35] you can't explain it
[1:14:37] but you believe that you are safe
[1:14:41] praise the lord
[1:14:43] amen
[1:14:45] you believe that
[1:14:46] it's in your heart
[1:14:49] your salvation is not attached to church
[1:14:51] affiliation it's attached to a
[1:14:54] relationship with jesus christ
[1:15:01] but it's in the shadow form
[1:15:04] and as you travel in this life
[1:15:08] you start going from one shadow it's
[1:15:10] it's almost like a person approaching
[1:15:13] the light and you see you see the shadow
[1:15:17] there could be uh uh uh an elderly
[1:15:20] person like bro like brother dan he's a
[1:15:23] he's a very tall person but as if he's
[1:15:26] far away from the light you see the
[1:15:28] shadow like a little boy
[1:15:30] and as he as he starts to approach
[1:15:33] the shadow starts to grow
[1:15:36] the shadow starts to get bigger
[1:15:39] praise the lord
[1:15:41] and that's the way it is is that that
[1:15:44] that shadow of internal life that we
[1:15:47] have in us
[1:15:50] as we walk with god and we travel
[1:15:52] through this life
[1:15:55] the image starts to grow it starts to
[1:15:57] become real to us
[1:16:00] praise the lord
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:05] it starts to become real
[1:16:08] and as you grow in the lord
[1:16:14] heaven
[1:16:15] is not just a picture in your mind
[1:16:20] but it starts to become a true feeling
[1:16:26] in your heart
[1:16:29] you start to experience
[1:16:31] a peace that passed all understanding
[1:16:35] praise the lord
[1:16:38] when that when that experience
[1:16:42] hits your heart you can't keep grudge
[1:16:46] you don't feel happy gossiping about
[1:16:48] somebody
[1:16:52] you you don't feel
[1:16:54] happy keeping anything
[1:16:58] that is unpleasant in you
[1:17:02] praise the lord
[1:17:06] when you just
[1:17:07] bomb into something that is wrong you
[1:17:09] feel so uncomfortable
[1:17:15] people that would claim
[1:17:17] having eternal life
[1:17:19] and and and and they can sleep in sin
[1:17:22] and wake up in sin
[1:17:24] they just have
[1:17:28] a
[1:17:28] confession they don't have an experience
[1:17:34] praise the lord
[1:17:36] now so brother branham said here
[1:17:38] he says
[1:17:40] when death strikes you
[1:17:44] in the body
[1:17:46] and your heart
[1:17:48] quit
[1:17:49] beating
[1:17:52] and the mortal wheels begin to stand
[1:17:55] still
[1:17:56] the little shadow
[1:18:00] that you have in you
[1:18:03] it starts to go from shadow to shadow
[1:18:08] it starts becoming real
[1:18:11] praise the lord
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:14] it starts becoming real
[1:18:16] it starts to go from shadow to shadow
[1:18:20] to shadow
[1:18:22] that's how you travel so fast
[1:18:26] praise the lord
[1:18:30] and from shadow to shadow
[1:18:33] then
[1:18:34] it becomes like he says
[1:18:37] yeah
[1:18:41] a twinkle
[1:18:44] then next
[1:18:46] it looks like
[1:18:48] a creek
[1:18:53] you go so fast and then you start to
[1:18:55] break
[1:18:57] into a sound
[1:18:58] have you ever gone
[1:19:00] in a world where there is a creek you
[1:19:02] hear how the water rolls
[1:19:06] you are passing from mortal life to
[1:19:09] eternity
[1:19:11] you start to lose
[1:19:14] sound you
[1:19:17] they are crying they are yelling
[1:19:19] you start breaking on the other side
[1:19:24] and he's like
[1:19:31] praise the lord
[1:19:40] then the next thing it becomes
[1:19:43] like a river
[1:19:45] then the next thing is like an ocean you
[1:19:48] start to feel
[1:19:51] an atmosphere starts to hate you
[1:19:53] you are stepping into
[1:19:56] an atmosphere where you are feeling
[1:19:59] you are feeling
[1:20:01] the heavenly atmosphere
[1:20:05] praise the lord
[1:20:08] you go from shadow
[1:20:10] to shadow
[1:20:12] to shadow
[1:20:17] and as you as you're going through this
[1:20:19] shadow
[1:20:20] the light starts to break forth
[1:20:25] the darkness starts to pass
[1:20:28] you see brother brandon share this life
[1:20:30] this life right now where we're sitting
[1:20:32] down in church
[1:20:35] this is just the negative
[1:20:38] everything that you see
[1:20:40] and you know of yourself
[1:20:42] is the negative
[1:20:45] you ever seen the negative
[1:20:47] you look at the the the fame the
[1:20:50] negative
[1:20:52] you look so funny
[1:20:54] you look how you look at the light
[1:20:57] how my nose looking
[1:21:01] it looks so funny
[1:21:07] it's just the negative
[1:21:14] praise the lord
[1:21:20] and then after a while
[1:21:22] you are standing
[1:21:23] in the present
[1:21:25] of your loved one standing yander
[1:21:28] clothed in a garment
[1:21:31] of
[1:21:32] a celestial body
[1:21:35] praise the lord
[1:21:38] so as you are going through
[1:21:41] this shadow
[1:21:43] you have already dropped off
[1:21:46] this body
[1:21:50] and you're going through the
[1:21:53] just like a vacuum sucking
[1:22:02] right into
[1:22:04] a celestral body
[1:22:10] and you are conscious
[1:22:14] you are conscious
[1:22:17] look at yourself
[1:22:19] that's me
[1:22:23] you look back he says oh wow
[1:22:26] that's me
[1:22:30] then this body that you cherish
[1:22:32] you start to see how so ugly and awful
[1:22:36] it is when you look down
[1:22:40] praise the lord
[1:22:42] you look down
[1:22:44] when brother branham says at a pet's
[1:22:46] house
[1:22:50] praise the lord
[1:22:53] the body that you've been so cherishing
[1:22:54] you feel so proud and better than other
[1:22:57] people you look at it you don't even
[1:22:58] want to go there you don't even want to
[1:23:01] go back in it
[1:23:04] you look at this one oh man
[1:23:08] you look at that one
[1:23:09] really
[1:23:15] you're being
[1:23:18] sucked you in a celestial body
[1:23:26] where you are conscious
[1:23:30] you are conscious
[1:23:32] starts to look around you
[1:23:38] though i walk through the valley
[1:23:41] of the or the shadow of death
[1:23:45] the valley of the shadow of death
[1:23:48] i would fear no evil
[1:23:51] you see that's why david could say this
[1:23:56] he says i will fear no evil
[1:23:59] because death
[1:24:00] is just a shadow that is going to break
[1:24:03] me forth to the other side
[1:24:05] this side is so dark
[1:24:08] light from the outside starts to press
[1:24:11] in
[1:24:12] and it sucks you through
[1:24:17] hey look at anybody
[1:24:21] praise the lord
[1:24:23] let's read on a little bit
[1:24:25] i won't keep you long because
[1:24:28] we just have so much of this
[1:24:30] to fellowship around these few days
[1:24:33] praise the lord
[1:24:34] you see when the lord allowed things
[1:24:36] like this he has a purpose
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:41] he has a purpose
[1:24:51] he has a purpose
[1:25:06] he says and
[1:25:07] and after a while you are standing in
[1:25:09] the presence
[1:25:10] of your loved ones
[1:25:14] standing behind the cloth in a garment
[1:25:18] of
[1:25:20] a celestial body then just like we
[1:25:22] talked before i mean when when you are
[1:25:25] sucked into that present
[1:25:27] you are uh uh
[1:25:30] the lord
[1:25:32] comfort us
[1:25:35] in in in the sense that we meet people
[1:25:38] that's what brother branham says right
[1:25:40] into the presence of your loved ones you
[1:25:42] meet people that you are familiar with
[1:25:45] familiar faces
[1:25:48] praise the lord
[1:25:50] you don't you don't get into that place
[1:25:52] and starts to meet job and abraham
[1:25:55] no you meet people
[1:26:02] praise the lord
[1:26:04] people that you are familiar with
[1:26:07] and you recognize them quickly
[1:26:13] praise the lord
[1:26:18] and they will recognize you
[1:26:22] because they will all be right at jordan
[1:26:24] waiting for you
[1:26:27] praise the lord
[1:26:33] they will not be
[1:26:34] surprised and you will not be surprised
[1:26:43] it happened so fast
[1:26:46] that that
[1:26:48] just at that time you start to catch up
[1:26:57] let's read on a little bit well maybe we
[1:26:59] might just read this
[1:27:01] comfort ourselves tonight
[1:27:04] amen
[1:27:16] that's the reason why let's make sure
[1:27:19] our
[1:27:21] our heart is right
[1:27:23] that our life is right that there is
[1:27:25] nothing between
[1:27:27] your soul and the savior
[1:27:32] the lord that there is nothing between
[1:27:34] the soul and the savior
[1:27:38] because
[1:27:40] death could take us at any time
[1:27:43] praise the lord
[1:27:45] joshua and
[1:27:47] danny driving to service tonight and run
[1:27:49] into an accident
[1:27:56] i mean anything could happen
[1:28:00] praise the lord
[1:28:02] what matters
[1:28:03] is how we get on the other side
[1:28:09] praise the lord
[1:28:12] some goes from shadow
[1:28:14] and it gets darker
[1:28:16] and gets darker
[1:28:18] and gets darker
[1:28:21] praise the lord
[1:28:22] brother branham says sometimes they see
[1:28:24] it right on their death bed and they
[1:28:26] start streaming it's not getting dark
[1:28:28] it's dark in here
[1:28:31] it's because they're beginning to travel
[1:28:35] in that dark region
[1:28:38] for the man
[1:28:42] that got life at the altar
[1:28:46] he goes
[1:28:49] shadow and shadow and shadow
[1:28:52] and it starts to get brighter
[1:29:06] and after a while you are standing in
[1:29:08] the presence of your loved ones
[1:29:10] standing under clothes in a garment of
[1:29:13] of celestial body
[1:29:15] that
[1:29:16] you know
[1:29:17] one another
[1:29:19] that you know one another
[1:29:22] familiar faces
[1:29:25] you're not guessing
[1:29:31] praise the lord
[1:29:33] you're not guessing
[1:29:34] you say and and that is the reason why
[1:29:37] sometimes we made a very poor example
[1:29:40] where i mean you're in a church and and
[1:29:43] and you're having an opportunity to know
[1:29:45] a brother or having an opportunity to
[1:29:47] know a sister and and and and you just
[1:29:50] make yourself a stranger
[1:29:52] some people just step through the door
[1:29:54] they come to sit down listen to some
[1:29:55] arrived they just go and no no time to
[1:29:58] to even shake a brother hand and just
[1:30:00] let let me just visit with this sister
[1:30:02] today or this brother and ask oh brother
[1:30:04] how are you what i mean how are you
[1:30:06] what's your name
[1:30:15] praise the lord
[1:30:18] even in church we are on the clock
[1:30:23] we want the service to go quickly and
[1:30:25] then we just pick up our bag oh we we
[1:30:28] love to visit with our favorite person
[1:30:36] we have this one favorite person that we
[1:30:38] like to visit with and talk with
[1:30:48] celestial body that's
[1:30:51] you know one another love one another
[1:30:54] you have turned back
[1:30:56] to a young man
[1:31:00] and a young woman
[1:31:02] again
[1:31:06] exactly right
[1:31:08] in which there until
[1:31:11] the coming of the lord
[1:31:14] amen
[1:31:17] and and uh and someday
[1:31:20] that glorified body he says now remember
[1:31:24] that is a celestial body not a glorified
[1:31:27] body
[1:31:28] a celestial body
[1:31:30] and someday that celestial body will
[1:31:33] leave heaven with jesus
[1:31:37] praise the lord
[1:31:40] it will come down to pick up this body
[1:31:43] this one that we drop down you
[1:31:46] it will come and call this body to
[1:31:48] perfection
[1:31:58] for i said unto you
[1:32:00] second tester learning five
[1:32:03] or first testament and five brother
[1:32:05] brandon says one or the other i said
[1:32:06] unto you
[1:32:08] i would not have you ignorant brethren
[1:32:10] concerning those that are asleep
[1:32:14] that you sorrow net
[1:32:17] even
[1:32:18] as
[1:32:19] others which have no hope
[1:32:22] praise the lord
[1:32:24] that's the reason why we i mean we we
[1:32:25] can we i mean we can we can dwarve
[1:32:30] in sorrow
[1:32:32] our our our sympathy
[1:32:35] the feeling that we have
[1:32:38] praise the lord
[1:32:40] i was thinking on this
[1:32:42] and uh and just i mean just like i said
[1:32:45] sometimes
[1:32:46] you know when you start gearing your
[1:32:47] mind
[1:32:49] it's hard for you to get away from
[1:32:51] some things you were thinking about
[1:32:53] think about this
[1:32:54] i was thinking about something like this
[1:32:56] to speak on friday but you think about
[1:32:58] this
[1:33:00] jesus just told mary and mata
[1:33:04] that i'm the resurrection
[1:33:07] the life
[1:33:09] he just she just told mary your brother
[1:33:11] will live again
[1:33:14] praise the lord
[1:33:15] he told his disciples
[1:33:18] let's go to lazarus and wake him up
[1:33:24] praise the lord but my question to you
[1:33:28] he knew that lazarus was coming back to
[1:33:30] life
[1:33:31] but why did he weep
[1:33:33] yes
[1:33:35] that's right
[1:33:38] why did he weep
[1:33:42] he knew that lazarus was coming back to
[1:33:45] life
[1:33:48] he told the disciple let's go and wake
[1:33:50] him up it was good that i was not there
[1:33:54] but why did he weep then
[1:33:59] praise the lord
[1:34:00] oh he was just supposed to say oh glory
[1:34:02] be to god hallelujah
[1:34:04] it's coming to come i'm telling you
[1:34:06] people you'll stop crying
[1:34:11] but why did he weep
[1:34:16] before
[1:34:18] saying lazar
[1:34:22] come forth
[1:34:28] not even at the house when he got there
[1:34:30] and he met mary the martyr and he
[1:34:33] started crying oh my goodness my friend
[1:34:35] lost her he never even cried at the
[1:34:37] house
[1:34:40] he waited until
[1:34:42] they got to the gravesite
[1:34:49] he stood there
[1:34:54] he already asked and where do you let
[1:34:56] him
[1:34:58] and everybody started going he got to
[1:35:00] the graveside
[1:35:03] and the bible says
[1:35:05] he wept
[1:35:09] praise the lord
[1:35:11] now so think about it he's coming to
[1:35:13] call him out of the grave lazarus coming
[1:35:15] back to life then why are you crying
[1:35:17] jesus
[1:35:20] why are you crying
[1:35:21] he's coming back to life
[1:35:23] now so it's the same thing that happened
[1:35:26] to the believer we know that he's in a
[1:35:29] better body
[1:35:30] but yet at the graveside we weep
[1:35:33] [Laughter]
[1:35:34] we know that he's in heaven we know that
[1:35:37] he's in a brand new body
[1:35:39] but yet at the graveside
[1:35:42] there's a mixed emotion
[1:35:52] oh my goodness i'll keep the rest
[1:35:56] i'll keep the rest
[1:36:03] doesn't this look strange
[1:36:08] i mean if he was just only going to
[1:36:10] visit the grave and look at the
[1:36:12] tombstone
[1:36:14] say oh my friend lazarus
[1:36:16] oh lazarus
[1:36:21] but he already said that he's going to
[1:36:23] wake him up
[1:36:26] he was not just going to try to see if
[1:36:28] lazarus was coming up
[1:36:30] he was actually going to raise him from
[1:36:33] the dead
[1:36:34] but then why
[1:36:36] did he have to weep
[1:36:43] praise the lord
[1:36:46] so it's never the bad thing to weep at
[1:36:48] the gravesite
[1:36:50] it does not believe that you don't have
[1:36:52] faith
[1:36:54] it does not show that you don't believe
[1:36:56] that the person is in the brain new body
[1:37:00] praise the lord
[1:37:02] he's just
[1:37:04] a cross of emotion
[1:37:14] we appreciate the lord tonight
[1:37:18] for i said unto you
[1:37:20] i will now have you ignorant virgins
[1:37:22] concerning those that are asleep
[1:37:26] that you sorrow not even
[1:37:28] as others which have no hope
[1:37:32] for if we believe
[1:37:34] christ died and rose again the 10 day
[1:37:37] even so those
[1:37:40] that sleep in christ will god bring
[1:37:43] with him
[1:37:45] praise the lord
[1:37:48] for we say
[1:37:49] this unto you
[1:37:52] by the commandment of the lord that we
[1:37:54] which are alive and and remain
[1:37:57] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[1:37:59] prevent or handle the best word handle
[1:38:02] those which are asleep for the trumpet
[1:38:05] of the lord shall sound the dead in
[1:38:07] christ shall rise
[1:38:08] this celestial body come down
[1:38:13] and and put on effluent
[1:38:16] it puts on ethel
[1:38:19] just like we explained the three bodies
[1:38:22] the the terrestrial body that's what we
[1:38:24] had we are dwelling in now
[1:38:27] and we have a celestial body brothers
[1:38:29] cat is in his celestial body
[1:38:32] praise the lord
[1:38:33] amen but in that celestial body
[1:38:37] he cannot eat
[1:38:42] he cannot drink
[1:38:45] because he don't need it
[1:38:50] praise the lord
[1:38:52] he don't need it
[1:38:55] glory be to god
[1:38:57] you see that's why brother branham
[1:38:59] explained
[1:39:00] and says that
[1:39:02] when the believer choose to spend some
[1:39:05] time with the lord
[1:39:07] he fast and pray
[1:39:09] it's not a hunger strike he says when
[1:39:11] you feed hungry go and eat
[1:39:16] because if god called you to that time
[1:39:19] he's going to produ he's going to
[1:39:21] provide
[1:39:22] a gap
[1:39:24] where you're going to spend time with
[1:39:26] him not looking at the clock
[1:39:30] and feeling hungry
[1:39:34] praise the lord
[1:39:36] that's that's that's religion
[1:39:38] that's what the buddhists do that's what
[1:39:40] the muslims do
[1:39:46] but god will take you into a spear word
[1:39:49] you are not feeling hungry you just you
[1:39:51] are just there you want to praise the
[1:39:53] lord you just you just just a little
[1:39:55] time

[1:40:49] some of the things that the message
[1:40:51] brings to us
[1:40:53] you will struggle with it in your mind
[1:40:56] because it's just
[1:40:58] all you think you know
[1:41:00] is just a shadow of truth
[1:41:05] that's why when some things are said
[1:41:06] brother branham said you struggle with
[1:41:08] it in your mind
[1:41:11] and you think that you know better than
[1:41:13] the prophet
[1:41:14] this is a man that lived his life in a
[1:41:18] dual reign
[1:41:22] praise the lord
[1:41:24] brother branham talks about being in the
[1:41:26] prayer line for days without food
[1:41:31] for days with our full praying for
[1:41:33] people

[1:41:49] you know one good thing i know about the
[1:41:51] lord
[1:41:52] he don't force nothing down our trout
[1:41:54] because he know if he force it down your
[1:41:56] throat you will vomit
[1:41:58] he wants you to eat it and enjoy it
[1:42:02] that's the thing about this word you
[1:42:04] have to enjoy it you have to enjoy the
[1:42:07] preaching of the word
[1:42:09] we're not stuffing you
[1:42:11] no we're not forcing nothing down your
[1:42:14] throat
[1:42:16] praise the lord
[1:42:18] if you are not enjoying it you will just

[1:42:39] now a glorified body is when the
[1:42:42] celestial body
[1:42:44] blends with a telesco a terrestrial body
[1:42:48] when the two comes together
[1:42:51] then it's glorified
[1:42:55] praise the lord
[1:42:56] you can eat and drink and you can also
[1:42:59] go through a wall
[1:43:01] you have a body that can be touched
[1:43:06] praise the lord
[1:43:10] jesus was in a glorified body it never
[1:43:13] took his cast
[1:43:20] but when he read from he said don't
[1:43:22] touch me because he was in
[1:43:26] a celestial body you have not extended
[1:43:29] to the father yet
[1:43:32] so he's no don't touch me

[1:45:30] and we which are alive and remain shall
[1:45:33] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:45:36] an eye
[1:45:37] that moment twinkling of an eye
[1:45:41] shadows of shadows of shadow twinkling
[1:45:43] break rivers

[1:46:08] when the son of god a young man or a
[1:46:10] young woman really gave their heart to
[1:46:13] the lord and say oh god help me
[1:46:17] sincere pull their heart out
[1:46:20] you watch and see how the grace of god
[1:46:23] start dealing with that person

[1:46:32] thing you got to be justified for it you
[1:46:34] got to be sanctified for you get all of
[1:46:36] these things in your mind and god have
[1:46:39] just taken that person from death onto
[1:46:42] life
[1:46:46] from death
[1:46:48] onto life
[1:46:54] happens
[1:46:56] in the service
[1:46:58] and we don't even see it
[1:47:01] brother branham says we don't we don't
[1:47:03] see it he said we he says we find people
[1:47:06] dying in the pill
[1:47:09] and also there are people that are
[1:47:11] passing from death onto life
[1:47:14] why they sit there the bible says why
[1:47:17] peter speak these words
[1:47:20] right before the eyes of those
[1:47:22] hebrews those who are hebrews believers
[1:47:25] those jewish believers they saw the
[1:47:27] gentiles passing from death unto life
[1:47:30] peter said wow
[1:47:32] god is no respecter of person
[1:47:35] he gave them the holy ghost even before
[1:47:37] they were baptized
[1:47:40] yes he says
[1:47:42] why why
[1:47:43] why then stop why why stop them from
[1:47:45] being baptized
[1:47:59] and as a preacher
[1:48:01] you don't
[1:48:02] you don't know what happened when a man
[1:48:04] stands behind this puppet
[1:48:06] it's not to read bunch of coats to you
[1:48:10] it's not a showman
[1:48:15] but you come
[1:48:16] behind this puppy with a burden in your
[1:48:18] heart
[1:48:19] watching to see someone passing from
[1:48:21] death onto life
[1:48:23] and you can see it
[1:48:28] you can see it
[1:48:32] thank you jesus
[1:48:33] you can see it
[1:48:39] praise the lord
[1:48:44] it happens many times
[1:48:47] we pass from death onto life
[1:48:50] not just only one time
[1:48:59] that's what the preaching of the gospel
[1:49:01] is all about
[1:49:03] is to pass you
[1:49:05] from death
[1:49:07] onto life
[1:49:10] praise the lord
[1:49:14] that's what brother branham taught us
[1:49:16] the reference that we have in the
[1:49:18] service
[1:49:20] when we come here
[1:49:23] not dragging our feet
[1:49:27] the church door is open by seven o'clock
[1:49:29] we come almost eight o'clock when the
[1:49:30] message is about to preach
[1:49:38] we come ready
[1:49:42] we come ready
[1:49:44] because it happens so fast
[1:49:50] while you sit there and think there is
[1:49:51] nothing happening in the service
[1:49:54] another person is sitting there and
[1:49:55] saying oh my god
[1:49:57] oh god thank you jesus
[1:49:59] oh god
[1:50:01] oh god
[1:50:04] oh god
[1:50:05] one verse
[1:50:08] or one phrase or one thing the preacher
[1:50:10] said just open heaven
[1:50:14] and just make that person power wow
[1:50:17] wow lord jesus thank you help me
[1:50:20] pass from death
[1:50:22] onto life
[1:50:28] do i walk

[1:50:36] for thou out with me your rod that road
[1:50:39] and that staff
[1:50:40] shall comfort me
[1:50:44] because i know i'm going from shadow
[1:50:46] to shadow onto shadow onto shadow
[1:50:50] onto shadow
[1:51:00] musicians you can come tonight
[1:51:19] and that's the reason why we continue to
[1:51:20] encourage you young people
[1:51:23] don't play with the opportunity that you
[1:51:25] have

[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:37] of experiencing the supernatural let
[1:51:39] that desire of experiencing the holy
[1:51:41] ghost let that desire
