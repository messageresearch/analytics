[1:38] book in the Bible and it is Trials like
[1:42] we go through now and his wife even at
[1:45] the closest thing to him on Earth so I
[1:46] want you to curse God and die to death
[1:48] he said thou speak us like a foolish
[1:50] the lord gave the Lord taken away
[1:53] blessed be the name of the Lord and then
[1:56] when the spirit of God come upon him and
[1:58] he began to prophesy said I know my
[2:00] redeemer liveth and the last days you'll
[2:03] stand upon this Earth though the
[2:04] skinworks destroys his body yet my flesh
[2:06] shall I see God
[2:07] and he made a place to bury himself he
[2:10] said about by this ground and he's
[2:11] bought there and buried himself later on
[2:14] become a man named Abraham
[2:16] Church growing coming on up Abraham but
[2:20] now he had the potentials of God too
[2:22] everlasting life
[2:23] eternal because God called him now
[2:26] notice when he died or Sarah died he
[2:29] bought a piece of ground in Palestine
[2:31] near job's grave and buried Sarah
[2:33] Abraham died and also was buried with
[2:36] Sarah Abraham begot God Isaac and Isaac
[2:41] when he died he slept with Abraham in
[2:45] the same personal ground now
[2:48] when Isaac begot Jacob Jacob died way
[2:51] down in Egypt
[2:52] but being a prophet now with this
[2:54] potential this quickening power he said
[2:57] don't you bury me down here Joseph
[2:59] come here my Prophet son
[3:03] put your hand upon this hip that God
[3:04] crippled
[3:06] swear to the god of Heaven do not bury
[3:08] me down here
[3:10] what was in that man
[3:12] why wasn't Egypt just as good as any
[3:15] place he was he was a prophet
[3:18] you know where that Resurrection is
[3:19] going to be what's going to be in Egypt
[3:21] be in Palestine
[3:23] so put your hands up on my hip
[3:25] and you swear with a God that I've
[3:27] served you're my Prophet son that you'll
[3:30] not bury my bones down here take me up
[3:32] your honor and bear me
[3:34] Joseph being a prophet also ladies hands
[3:36] upon his daddy said I swear over
[3:38] the god of Abraham I think of Jacob I'll
[3:40] not bury you here they're talking about
[3:42] buried him up in that land why why when
[3:45] Joseph died he said don't you marry me
[3:47] down here
[3:50] don't bear me down here why
[3:53] God's got everywhere but he has a plan
[3:56] Joseph was a prophet
[3:58] he said someday listen to these words
[4:01] the Lord God will will visit you and
[4:04] we'll take you out of this land and when
[4:05] you go you take my bones
[4:08] amen that quickly power was in that boat
[4:12] oh we have the spirit of him that raised
[4:15] up Christ the dead dwelling
[4:17] he'll also Quicken your mortal bodies
[4:21] don't put my bones down here
[4:24] bury him up there
[4:27] but those are the promise
[4:29] when Jesus come here I've got a
[4:31] scripture here at Matthew 27 51 when
[4:34] Jesus raised from the dead job seen that
[4:37] coming said I know my redeemer living
[4:40] stand upon this Earth though the skin
[4:42] worms has destroyed this body yet my
[4:44] face shall see God I've seen him they
[4:47] know that was a prophet
[4:49] Abraham was a prophet Isaac was a
[4:52] prophet Jacob was a Prophet Joseph was a
[4:55] prophet
[4:56] and they had the revelation of God
[4:58] according to his word
[5:01] on that Easter morning when that one
[5:04] came and redeemed all those who had
[5:07] believed on him they raised too
[5:09] according to the Bible that quickening
[5:11] power come into the grave of job where
[5:13] there wasn't even a spoonful of the Dust
[5:15] of his bones left
[5:16] after all those hundreds and hundreds
[5:18] and hundreds of years
[5:20] his bones had decayed it went back and
[5:23] turned back to the gases of the Earth
[5:25] just a mere Ash dustly there
[5:29] but yet when that's quickening power
[5:31] according to the word of God to the
[5:33] promise hundreds and hundreds yes
[5:35] thousands of years later
[5:37] when that quickly power would brought
[5:39] forth the grave job Abraham Isaac Jacob
[5:42] Harlem come out of the Grave with him
[5:45] the Bible said so Saint Matthew the 27th
[5:49] chapter and 51st verse is that many of
[5:51] the saints that slept in the dusty Earth
[5:53] resurrected it come out of the graves
[5:55] with him when he come up on Easter
[5:57] morning why they had that potential they
[6:00] had that quickening power
[6:02] see and raised up from the dead and went
[6:06] with him in the resurrection
[6:08] enjoyed the resurrection with him
[6:11] because they were full of that
[6:13] quickening power they had that genuine
[6:15] Easter seal where they say I wish sadly
[6:18] back the Old Testament wait a minute and
[6:20] first thesis Thessalonians the fourth
[6:22] chapter of the 16th verse
[6:27] oh she read that
[6:29] I would not have you ignorant Brethren
[6:30] concerning those that sleep that you saw
[6:33] or not even as others which have no hope
[6:35] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[6:37] rose again the third day not make belief
[6:39] but we believe even so them that sleep
[6:42] in him shall God bring with him
[6:44] the New Testament Saints with that
[6:47] quickening power shall resurrect also at
[6:49] his second coming just as sure as the
[6:52] Old Testament Saints with all that
[6:53] quickly powerful in their bones and
[6:55] translations and powers and so forth as
[6:58] shown of God their prophets who the word
[7:00] of God came to they resurrected with him
[7:03] on that Resurrection Marty
[7:06] and with the promise of God that
[7:08] everyone that's in Christ Jesus will
[7:09] also come with him in his resurrection
[7:11] the quickly power of God upon the bones
[7:16] no wonder we lay hands on the sick
[7:19] no wonder we love one another we're
[7:23] brothers and sisters
[7:25] we shouldn't hate one another because
[7:27] we're corrected by the word of God we
[7:30] should love one another
[7:31] and have respects for one another you
[7:34] know if you don't it won't help you
[7:38] there's a little fellow sitting right
[7:39] here under this church now a few days
[7:42] ago that man believes
[7:44] little old boy had a cancer on his ear
[7:47] and he wouldn't say nothing about he's
[7:49] working up there at the house I've been
[7:50] on a hunting trip with him up there at
[7:52] the Mosley Brothers
[7:54] Dawson here was up here hunting brother
[7:57] William's son and I have to look over on
[7:59] his ear and I see his air all swollen up
[8:01] and I said what's the matter Donovan
[8:03] that ear he said Brother Bear it's been
[8:05] a long time but don't know I just missed
[8:06] calling him to the hand there that was a
[8:08] big cancer on his ear
[8:10] never said one word just held it without
[8:13] my brother
[8:16] in a day or two at that there was even a
[8:19] star left of it
[8:21] it was his respect
[8:24] to the god of Heaven by his quickening
[8:27] power
[8:28] kill that cancer
[8:30] and spared the life of Donovan words
[8:33] back there
[8:34] it's right what is these things look at
[8:36] your people here in Phoenix look at you
[8:38] people who's believed in this look the
[8:41] people who has this that lays our hands
[8:42] upon you watch what happens it's
[8:44] quickening power these signs shall
[8:47] follow them that believe if they lay
[8:49] their hands on the sink that quickly
[8:51] power Eagle to Eagle
[8:54] something's going to take place
[8:57] not equal to a buzzard won't work
[9:00] Eagle to Eagle raises from the barnyard
[9:04] to the heavenlies
[9:06] these signs shall follow them
[9:09] that believe and they're both in believe
[9:11] see that same quickening power of God
[9:15] represented in these two prophets Elijah
[9:18] and Elijah notice
[9:20] same word one of them is ketchup the
[9:23] others caught up
[9:25] catch up and caught up see
[9:28] he was caught up we'll be ketchup
[9:32] catch up with them meet him in the air
[9:34] be caught up to meet him in the air
[9:36] notice a bird has to have two Wings to
[9:38] balance itself
[9:40] is that right
[9:41] Elijah was a translating Wing Elijah
[9:44] Elisha was a resurrection wing see both
[9:47] of them together representing the saints
[9:50] that are living and the saints that are
[9:52] gone on remember Quicken to see the past
[9:57] the curtains how these people were
[9:59] quickened back there to look past the
[10:01] curtain and see down in this time those
[10:03] prophets look at Paul said in the last
[10:05] days how these people would be acting
[10:07] call themselves Christians he was a
[10:09] prophet full of the quickening power
[10:11] four sword come to pass we believe that
[10:13] don't we he received quick and power
[10:15] look at the quickening power today for
[10:18] telling things without one event missing
[10:21] not one time does it fail quickening
[10:24] power not the power of a man the power
[10:27] of God the power the abstract of Easter
[10:30] the resurrected Jesus has sent back the
[10:33] abstract to guarantee us that we're
[10:35] already quickened with him notice you
[10:37] remember the book businessman you're
[10:39] looking to pass the curtain of time
[10:42] and I begin to get older knowing my days
[10:45] are getting shorter now I get real I
[10:47] play that little piece of them ladies
[10:49] saying a while ago I've had it for about
[10:50] 18 20 years now I want to talk it
[10:53] Overlord they get out there and go to
[10:55] praying then acquainting power comes I'm
[10:57] rested up and I looked up there and I
[10:59] said look at the honor I remember that
[11:00] morning being called a past and my wife
[11:02] sitting back there laying on the same
[11:04] bed with me that morning and I was
[11:06] raised up and looked up in there she is
[11:07] asleep and I said if I'm gonna do
[11:09] anything to the Lord you better hurry up
[11:10] or hear it past 50.
[11:12] and the Holy Spirit caught me away and I
[11:14] looked over there
[11:16] I've seen those Saints just as certain
[11:18] I'm standing here but this desperate
[11:20] this sacred book laying here in a
[11:21] minister of the Gospel have I ever told
[11:24] you anything in the name of the Lord
[11:25] about what happened
[11:27] I want you to tell me about it every
[11:29] time has it been perfectly at the
[11:31] platform every time has it happened just
[11:33] like he said
[11:34] this was thus saith the Lord
[11:37] I stood there and looked over that time
[11:39] I've seen tens of thousands times
[11:40] thousands coming young men and women run
[11:42] throwing their arms around me screaming
[11:44] I'll look right back see myself laying
[11:46] on the bed
[11:47] oh Lord let me look at past the curtain
[11:50] of time what is it it's creating power
[11:52] now it catches away
[11:54] that great quickly power the quickening
[11:57] power coming this last days that's what
[11:59] I'm in Arizona for right now there's
[12:01] many people sitting right here stood
[12:02] right here in Phoenix and heard me tell
[12:04] you from this very platform the saith
[12:06] the Lord
[12:07] how many remembers it uh of course
[12:10] something's fixing to happen I saw seven
[12:11] angels come didn't Life Magazine packet
[12:14] is the fog of it floated across here 27
[12:17] miles high and 30 miles across it's not
[12:19] Fred stopping these other Gene Norman
[12:21] I'm sitting back there stood right there
[12:23] with them seven angels appeared right
[12:24] there on the hill to shut the heels
[12:26] through miles around like that there
[12:28] stood seven angels and thought a sword
[12:30] in your hand said go home and open these
[12:32] Seven Seals they're given
[12:34] and here they are the true mystery of
[12:37] marriage and the force and the Serpent's
[12:39] Seed and all these things it's been
[12:40] fussed about it's thus saith the Lord
[12:44] what is it's equating power coming to
[12:46] the church making it already this hour
[12:49] that we're approaching
[12:50] quickening power oh God help us to
[12:54] receive it even help us to believe it
[12:56] see it depends on what attitude you take
[12:58] to it or do you any good or not so you
[13:01] had to believe that if you don't believe
[13:02] it it won't do you one bit of good house
[13:04] Samuel stood there before that people
[13:06] and said have I ever told you anything
[13:08] in the name of Lord but what happened
[13:09] did I ever beg you for your money to
[13:11] live on no but we want the king anyhow
[13:13] that's the way the church is today they
[13:15] want their own ideas they won't pay a
[13:17] bit attention to either walk right
[13:19] around well it just go show the
[13:20] quickening powers not there
[13:22] Paul would say well I've spoke in
[13:23] tongues I jumped I shouted that's all
[13:25] fine but that quickly Powers there
[13:27] you'll recognize like a little ego
[13:29] that's his mama that's the word that's
[13:31] thus saith the Lord that's what God
[13:32] promised that's what was foretold that's
[13:34] exactly what happened we're Beyond any
[13:36] shed of Doubt potentially in the
[13:38] resurrection right now the Saints
[13:40] getting ready to be taken up in the air
[13:42] so Jesus so full of this quickly power
[13:46] said if you can destroy this Temple it
[13:48] took you 40 years you thought the bill
[13:50] I'll raise it up in three days
[13:53] why why could Jesus say that I want to
[13:56] ask you why could Jesus say a thing like
[13:58] that he knew that he was
[14:01] amen
[14:03] amen I wish I could make that stick
[14:08] he knew who he was
[14:11] he knew that every word God had wrote in
[14:14] there of him had fulfilled it
[14:16] he knew he was one David spoke of
[14:19] do you know you're the one the Bible
[14:21] speaks up yes do you know your position
[14:24] is in Christ if you're in Christ you're
[14:26] a new creature do you know this word is
[14:28] just like everyday living to you
[14:31] well sure it's yours you are an eagle at
[14:34] your food
[14:36] he knew that by the power of God he
[14:40] would do it because it was prophesied he
[14:42] would do it
[14:43] that's the reason he wasn't scared to
[14:45] say destroy this Temple I'll raise it up
[14:48] in three days because David said I'll
[14:50] not leave his soul in Hell neither will
[14:52] I suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[14:53] he know not one cell of his body would
[14:56] corrupt and he corrupts in 72 hours
[14:58] he said destroy this Temple I'll raise
[15:01] it up again
[15:04] in three days
[15:06] why he was so full of that quickening
[15:09] power that quickened every word he
[15:11] looked back and seen every word god
[15:13] wrote of him that Prophet said he'd
[15:14] fulfilled it he know that would be
[15:16] fulfilled too now every word that God
[15:19] said has your spirit said amen to it has
[15:21] been fulfilled in your life as a
[15:23] believer
[15:24] do you hold back on something say well
[15:26] my church teaches different
[15:27] then be careful Paul
[15:31] notice Eagles believe there's no
[15:33] question to them they believe it
[15:35] notice now he knew it would have
[15:38] happened because the word said it wasn't
[15:40] every word wrote of him had to be
[15:42] fulfilled
[15:44] he knew that it was written by the power
[15:47] of God by the holy prophets that had
[15:49] prophesied that he would do so and
[15:51] prophecy never fails
[15:54] it cannot the word of God can't fail
[15:58] and it is written in the by the spirit
[16:01] that is now also
[16:04] the spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[16:08] dead
[16:10] if it dwells in your
[16:13] being your body it will also Quicken
[16:16] your mortal
[16:18] mortal then shoot it burn it do anything
[16:21] you want to make fun of it tear it down
[16:24] turn it down do what you want to God
[16:27] will raise it up for you said he would
[16:29] man every saint of God has that promise
[16:32] and he knows that that's the truth so
[16:34] fear not brother we already into Easter
[16:37] look now
[16:39] that Transfiguration just before we
[16:40] close
[16:42] Transfiguration we are all represented
[16:45] there and Transfiguration look what we
[16:48] are seeing today notice just what we're
[16:51] seeing today the quickening power of God
[16:54] where's all there there was a dead
[16:56] Saints represented in Moses there was a
[17:00] resurrection in Jesus Christ glorified
[17:03] Elisha Moses Elijah and Jesus all
[17:07] standing on the mountain the dead Saints
[17:10] the raptured Saints and Jesus glorified
[17:14] oh my
[17:15] God why you say I heard a guy say this
[17:18] you people why if you had this kind of
[17:21] power you ought to go out and tell
[17:22] people what you can do
[17:24] far be it from a real Christian saying a
[17:27] thing like that see
[17:29] surely we don't claim no power to but we
[17:33] do
[17:34] one thing when they looked her out of
[17:36] all this power upon him they saw Jesus
[17:38] only
[17:40] and a real True Believer don't care
[17:42] whether he's backing up a denomination
[17:44] or nothing about it
[17:46] he only wants one thing for you to see
[17:48] that glorified Christ
[17:50] makes any difference a real true Mount
[17:52] Transfiguration experience only
[17:54] glorifies Jesus Christ he did glorify
[17:57] Moses and glorify Elijah and glorify
[17:59] themselves and glorify nothing else but
[18:01] they seem to glorify Christ and any True
[18:03] Believer that's what's in his heart to
[18:05] glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's
[18:08] trying to get the people see not say
[18:10] well if you come join our groups if you
[18:11] come do this or do that oh don't do that
[18:15] don't do that see God's word which is
[18:18] Christ magnified and fulfilled the
[18:22] promise of this day in this great hour
[18:24] of Resurrection notice
[18:27] and it gives them joy to know that we
[18:30] are with him a flesh of his flesh and
[18:35] bone of his bones what a joy that's the
[18:38] only thing a real believer cares about
[18:40] they don't care about a denomination
[18:42] they don't care about an organization
[18:43] they don't care about what the other
[18:44] women think
[18:46] they don't care certainly not they won't
[18:49] do these things that these other women
[18:50] do these men will do them things they
[18:52] won't hang and
[18:54] baby around with some organization keep
[18:56] being putting out and afraid they won't
[18:58] have a meal ticket
[18:59] they don't care about them things
[19:01] there's nonsense to them there's only
[19:03] one heart's desire that is to see Jesus
[19:05] Christ glorify yes there conduct must be
[19:09] with God it must absolutely nothing else
[19:11] but just the glory of Jesus Christ and
[19:13] what is Jesus the word
[19:16] is that right amen amen now I noticed
[19:19] and seeing his same Vindicated method
[19:22] proving his resurrection now what is it
[19:26] seeing your life by his promised word
[19:31] that he said he's the same yesterday and
[19:32] forever proving that he's still alive
[19:36] I don't care if every door in the
[19:38] country's close to me
[19:40] and I'm as I said I was 56th of the day
[19:43] snapped out I'm at the heart attack age
[19:45] I mean all this other agent everything
[19:47] else
[19:49] well what difference it didn't make any
[19:50] difference to me when I was a kid it
[19:51] don't make any difference now one hour
[19:53] my numbers called my card out the rent
[19:56] I don't care if they ever know they ever
[19:58] lived on the earth it don't make me no
[19:59] difference
[20:00] you don't have to have no big monuments
[20:02] and big Billings to say that I was
[20:03] showing her
[20:05] one thing I want to let me all to know
[20:07] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[20:09] today
[20:11] and in my heart I hold his abstract and
[20:16] I know that Sunday although I may be
[20:19] drowning in the sea I may be killed in
[20:20] Africa I don't know what happened to me
[20:22] if there's one thing I know I'll hold
[20:24] the abstract
[20:26] Hallelujah
[20:28] door can be closed I don't make a bit of
[20:30] difference to me
[20:31] I'm not trying to glorify some man or
[20:33] some organization nor myself or another
[20:35] group sir nothing else I want people to
[20:38] see Jesus Christ is raised from the dead
[20:41] and his Spirit lives
[20:43] same yesterday today forever no wonder
[20:46] Jesus said fear not I am he that was
[20:50] dead but I'm Alive forevermore
[20:54] for now
[20:55] we are Redeemed by him and are risen
[20:59] with him
