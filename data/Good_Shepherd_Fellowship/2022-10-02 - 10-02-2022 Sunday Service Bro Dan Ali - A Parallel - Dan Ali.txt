bless you brother Joshua for that testimony he had his III operation uh in the course of the week and uh his eyesight was really really bad yeah so it was not surprising hearing him say the other day he was leading the song service he couldn't even see the words behind him yeah so according to the doctor you know he was negative 15. and we prayed for everything 2020 and after the surgical operation that same day they had to check and it was 20 30. so by the grace of God he will get to the 2020. praise be together yes God bless you all for coming uh brother one as I said oh it's not in our miss this morning he's in DC with a family so remember him in your prayers after after the service today the family will be flying back but he wouldn't be coming in ontra probably Tuesday I'm not

Wesley says Carol remember them also we are not here today and uh his sister around I've not seen City yes remember our sister to employer and just pray that God gives us strength keep the baby in good health praise be to God we are serving a covenant keeping God and when you pray believe I believe with all my heart um last Sunday after the prayer service we had a wonderful time not after the prayer service we had that prayer meeting it was wonderful praise be to God there is a song that says that I hear the chain falling and if something happens when you pray When you pray about something the situation never Remains the Same and when we prayed that there were prayer requests that came up and we prayed you pray for brothers you pray for sisters as as it comes you don't know what happens but things happen now I want to wait the following day on Monday and almost every system I worked on there was a problem with it everything I worked on there was a problem with it I had to call for health they would come and restart this when we are done with this when I go to the next equipment the same problem and uh those things Rejoice my heart they rejoiced my heart if I get worried when those things happen the devil was touched praise be to God there was no doubt we touched the devil that night by the grace of God and all through the week it was one problem after the other and on Thursday we had a meeting um I didn't have to go in too early I was on the way to work on 94 and I just hit a truck on the back I didn't know how fast I was driving but all I saw the truck just and when I hit on my break it wasn't sharp enough and I just collected it and the truck behind me also just came and founded me off and I said what is this that was accident praise be to God um we came down we exchanged uh our insurance information I got to work before I started feeling pain in my neck and then my hair started aching and I felt funny in my back um I haven't gone to the hospital yet maybe tomorrow I'm not sure praise be to God yes and in all of this God has his eyes on his children praise be to God when the devil thinks he has cornered you God always makes a way out I want to work anyhow the following day I went to work I didn't call in and I'm strong I'm healthy if I have to go to the hospital tomorrow I will go maybe for the fun of it but by the grace of God I'm feeling fine praise be to God oh my we love the almighty God whenever you are coming to the house of God just come with your husband can't believe in that you will hear from God because God is here wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am in their midst God is in the midst of his people praise be to God having said that can we just write before I forget let's just read a scripture and I will see what the Lord has for us this morning praise be to God shall we turn our Bibles to Genesis 15 13. oh Genesis 15 13. and he said unto Abraham nor for as she already that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not yes and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years praise be to God shall we go to Exodus 3 7. Exodus 3 7. Exodus 3 7. 7 and 8. and the last side I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I've heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the land of Egypt out of the land of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land out to a good land and a lodge until a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites praise be to God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word in Jesus name shall we be seated praise be to God I'm here this morning to remind us that time is running out the title of my message this morning is a parallel a parallel last Wednesday my brother one was preaching he mentioned he says something I'm paraphrasing it I'm not quoting him way to word he said that the kingdom of Babylon everything God is doing from The Book of Genesis parallels what God did in the Kingdom of Babylon so when he used that word parallel I said no I will use it for a theme for today and what is parallel I took the definition this morning sitting in the pastor's office parallel means a person or thin that is similar or analogous to another if the word analogous is confusing just leave it on the side praise the Lord a person or sin everything that is either a story either a documentary whatever that is a narrative is similar to another praise be to God that is why the word parallel means and I'm using that for a team this morning a parallel and as I said I'm here to remind us that time indeed is running out there is no more time tonight maybe the time God decides to wrap it all up it could also be tomorrow it could also be a hundred years from today but whether it is tonight or a hundred years from today I am saying that time is no more time indeed is running out and if there was any time that we should mean business with God it is now if there is any time don't look at Mommy don't look at Daddy don't look at your brother or a sister God deals with that on individual basis if there is any time you ought to make business with God it is now what is keeping you back last Sunday on our way to church I was coming with Emmanuel and God's Will and they said they wanted something so we passed to the gas station on our Zen I was outside there I give them money to go in and they about whatever they wanted so when they came out of the truck I was sitting inside and I had it there was a gentleman in front there talking to them I didn't hear what he was saying but then he signaled me asking me to to to to to roll down my window which I did and he told me that he was talking to um the Deacon and the pastor they were going inside referring to these two boys [Music] so I started laughing and then he came closer he said it's a good thing that when he was small he was a bad boy and I could see traces of it on him He Is We are probably the same age group but he had a mother who was a Pentecostal mother who kept praying for him and how true is the story that we are here today because somebody prayed for us and if you are praying and trusting God for somebody or for whatever it is keep praying and keep believing God Will Never Let You Down but as I was sitting down and he was telling me it's a boy was once very bad I told him I was also very bad oh as I was also very bad but it's by the grace of God there he was standing in front and he went back there he was smoking cigar and then he told me that he was on his way to church and I was sitting down looking at this man that was on his way to church holding a cigar and then smoking and I kept asking myself I say if on his way to church he had to stop over to take cigar before going then I wonder what he would do on a day he's not going to church foreign demon it wasn't the first time I was seeing somebody smoking too and he swear to church no I have seen that over and over even in church sometimes you go to a place and a brother walks in and you can smell smoke on him you think he passed through the chimney before coming to church smelly smoke that was not my first time here there was a brother one service was going on he would go out there stand in front of the smoke and come back in we had to talk to him I don't care if you smoke 10 packets a day if that is the choice you have made that is up to you but it's not a good thing when we have children you go stand what are you teaching the children right right praise be to God somewhere last two months there was a young man that had a court case a serious court case a case that could turn somebody's life for good I don't want to go into the details and can you imagine you know we take the things of God for granted this man on that day when he was going to appear before the jury he was Horus of course I wasn't there if I was there I wouldn't have gotten this story to tell because it wouldn't have happened he was holding something wrapped in a piece of paper very long and he had another person beside him with his pants on the back both of them were holding each one each and guess what the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want foreign this is somebody that was appearing before the jury and this guy that was standing behind him the same thing ah my man I got you God will not let you down it is not the people to think that it is okay that the bad animals serve god with any reverence right somebody that ought to be on his knees crying to God asking for his Mercy for his divine intervention rather he went and took drug he was smoking weed while she was doing that and calling upon the name of the Lord now the Sinners are not the enemies of the Gospel the enemies of the Gospel are those who are holding this Bible and they are parading themselves preachers in the street and deceiving the Kingdom you know it is one thing when you are told the truth and you decide not to abide by it is another thing when you are being deceived into thinking that what you are doing is okay and a lot of the times these people are being deceived into thinking oh it's okay I can do anything why because there is a preacher somewhere behind a puppet that is telling them it's okay God is a loving God God will not put you to hell you know what lesbians and homosexuals are going to heaven who told you that if God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for this course why would God send s so I mean sodomize lesbians and homosexuals why would God turn around and send them into heaven and the other day I was surprised to hear that a pastor in this message is preaching somewhere that Satan is going to be in heaven and I asked myself so the brother said this in church and then the following Sunday he came back and met a congregation sitting down you have to run for your life if Satan is our brother and if Satan is going to be in heaven then why should I even come to church man why should I even serve God but can you imagine in this message in this message I am not talking of in this message Satan is never our brother he will never be he has never been and he will never be we are not going to spend eternity with Satan no way praise be to God this is how much people having deceived be merciful to the people out there that are doing the wrong things some of them genuinely do if some of them actually know what they are doing they will run for shelters can you imagine the other day talking to a colleague at work and he was telling me somebody prophesied that the world was going to end that was last two weeks Saturday and I told him don't believe in that nonsense why because somebody told about certain things and they happened so now he's saying the word is going I said don't believe in that I say it's only God who can tell and I asked him now you believe in that so what are you doing about your life you believe that God judgment is coming the word will be destroyed on Saturday what are you doing you are sitting out and waiting for it the people were talking about the world ending and yet they were not doing anything about their lives they were just sitting down and sitting ducks waiting and I took that to encourage him now even if the devil has succeeded if if the devil has succeeded in convincing you that you are not going to heaven and that you are not even good enough to go to heaven and you have believed it if you can believe the lie of the devil over the word of God if you have chosen to believe it I still encourage you keep moving on keep pressing on you may never know what God is going to do with the little step of Faith you take like the four lepers that were either entering in of the city of Samaria there was farming on the land and then they sat down they may have sat down for so long the handouts were not coming because the people in the city were hungry so where are you going to get food and they may have sat down and then thought you know what let's get into the city because when you listen to the conversation I believe something like that happened because they said if we even go into the city there is so farming day we are going to die anyhow so that means there was a conversation to that effect and I said you know what less than to the land of the syrians and Let's Fall in their hands we may live and if we die we are going to die anyhow man and when they started matching to the land of the syrians what is the serious here they had the footprints the sound of Tarios and of horses and I said oh our enemies are coming after us and they'll run into the mountains and this lepers just walked in and they had the booty of their lives not only did they get food but ornaments gold one of you praise be to God so you can never tell what God will do when you take that step of faith [Music] just take that step of faith and see what God does praise be to God there is a divine orchestration behind your life there is a divine plan in your life praise be to God God told Abraham that your seed after you are going to be strangers in a land that is not yes and they will serve the people and they'll be afflicted 400 years but he did not end there there was a promise that he was going to bring them out of captivity God did not ask Abraham his opinion he did not tell Abraham he just told him what he was going to do he did not seek his permission praise be to God now if God had asked Abraham his opinion we all know what Abraham would have done because later in Abraham's years when God came down to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah and God said must I hide this from Abraham see that he has been so faithful to me and he is going to teach his children to follow the word must I had this from Abraham and he taught Abraham Abraham I am going to destroy this city and Abraham may have just looked and considered his nephew said no he may have post a long pause and he asked God would you destroy the righteous with the wicked this is not the god of righteousness will you destroy the righteous with the wicked God said no if their Adventure there were 50 righteous people in the city will you destroy it God said no they didn't find 50. what if there was 45 God said no I wouldn't destroy it what if there was 40 God said no I wouldn't destroy it what if 30 20 10 they couldn't find 10 righteous people in the city what a merciful god we save if you find yourself at the wrong side it is not God who has put you there you out of your own lusts put yourself there so we know whatever whatever and it came to pass we all know the story how Israel ended up in Egypt and they were enslaved in Egypt they were punished indeed they were insulted they were looked down upon they did not regard them to be human beings the Egyptians did not regard them in any way and those people that the Egyptians disregarded so much and looked Upon Our slaves as captives good for nothing people there were a people after God's Own Heart [Music] this was the people God his eyes were on them and they were going through everything they were going through they may have thoughts that they were out of the will of God did not send them to Egypt to go punished you know I just I'm done I'm just going there to go and punish them no there is a reason behind everything everything God does and it's always for our own good but there was a promise God said he was going to deliver them and God here they had their cry and God sent them a deliverer with a message with science and wonders following to deliver his people again we know the story fast forward now the children of Israel were delivered and in the wilderness before the Red Sea when they'll stand and saw chariots coming and there was that blowing in the air they just started crying I shouting against the prophet of God I Remember by the one preaching last Wednesday you know God has done a lot in our lives and even if he has not done it for us we can look at people in our Cycles and we can tell God is doing something and we can see the hand of God but when situations come we tend to forget all the good God has done and then in that process fear takes over and whenever fear takes over there is no longer Faith fear and faith do not dwell together why there is fear there is no faith and when these people are crying and Moses turned and passed judgment on them and God told Moses why Christ thou unto me and God says something just tell the people to move forward that they may see the glory of God just tell her to move forward now as I said my message today is a parallel that we are picking a story here and we can look at how God deals with them on this side and we can apply it here and you see that God is dealing with us on the same level come back okay praise be to God now the Bible says that God said let us create man in our own image and God created man in his own image and that was the spirit man there was a man in God's Own likeness but the Bible says that God had created everything on the earth everything was looking so fine so beautiful but there was no man to till the Earth and we know the story how God formed man after the dust of the earth and he put this man inside that body to kill the Earth it was not your decision to come into this life it was not your plan that you want to come on the planet Earth God did not ask man his opinion he did not ask man what he thought about it he did not ask men his permission as a matter of fact if God had given men the permission to choose there is no man that was going to come into this life if God was going to open Mass eyes just to see what he was going to go through on this Earth man would not come to be in the image of God in the glory of God and to see how you are coming to be in this past this past pest house as the prophet calls it full of sicknesses full of diseases that if you don't take your bath two three days you want to hide yourself and then the hatred the worst the the malice the the greed the confusion if God was going to open Man's eyes to see what he was going to go through I believe the way man would have cried and jumped and rode God probably would have changed his mind but as the prophet of God said God had in him an attribute to be a savior and accept something gets lost how was he going to exercise that attribute of being a savior so men had to come into this life praise be to God we had no choice now every man that was born into this life was born directly into sin foreign we are Sinners by representation Adam and Eve sent and whoever was brought into this life it doesn't matter where it was in the hospital whether it was in a cave somewhere whether it was in the street you were born a sinner whether in the palace you were born a sinner we couldn't help it so we were born directly into captivity and we came into this life and all we knew was living in sin telling lies doing things we shouldn't do and as a matter of fact one who are living that life we enjoyed it because it was our nature that is the nature of sin into which man was born and you do this right wrong and you think oh I was smart The Devil Makes you to think oh I was smart you are not smart because smart people don't do the things we do you are living in error and you are happy with a life of Darkness a life of Sorrow and you are happy with it it shows how insane a man is outside of the economy of God because that was the nature of sin man was born into and then you come you do things live in error do all the things but as a child of God God is just a matter of time God deals with the Israelites as a nation and there was a time of Deliverance for them and God deals with us as individuals and there is a time of Deliverance for every child of God that is why when you can hear God knocking at the door of your heart you don't sit down and say no I'm waiting for this friend so we can go together I'm waiting for my son I'm waiting for mommy and daddy so we can go together God is not calling you as a family he is calling you as an individual when you hear the voice of God this day how do you not your heart when God is required to take a step of Faith take that step of faith praise be to God there is a time of Deliverance that God has sent us a prophet with a message the message of Miracle 4 5 and 6 is to turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the apostolic fathers to get the people ready for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to Deliver us from sin from iniquity from the life of Aaron to Deliver Us from what Superstition yes to deliver us from traditions to deliver us praise be to God there is power in this message if you want to experience the transformational power of God and not conform not just confirm to a church a geology but to to experience the transformational power of God you have it you have it you have the word and listening to pray around this moment that we shall all give an account to what we do with the word this word you are hearing today whatever you do with the word of God you are going to give an account of it there is power in this word of God to deliver there is power in the world to set the captive free there is power in the World to Change any circumstance without a doubt if you are not experiencing it check your life check your life if you are not experiencing it check your life examine yourself praise be to God and remember when God delivered the children of Israel pharaoh and his people sat down and they said oh what have you just done what have we just done we allow these people to go who is going to save us we need to get them back and they weren't just chasing them now the Lord Jesus said when an evil spirit is cast out of a man it just goes wandering around but it's going to come back and when it comes back is coming to look in there to see has the husband claimed sanitized is it empty and if the house is empty that evil spirit is going to bring what seven more wicked spirits and they are coming to live in that person and the end of that man is worse than his beginning they are not going to sit down and just look at you go they are going to come after you anyhow as pharaoh and his people pursue the children of Israel the demons those demons that were cast out they are going to come back anyhow and they are going to look in there if it's empty can you imagine if you were somebody like Mary Magdalene out of whom seven evil spirits were cast out a lot of the times when we are talking about evil spirits people say oh because you don't fly at night praise be to God because you don't fly at night you think you are clean Mary Magdalene was not flying she's like that those spirits Pride anger malice gossip bitterness just think about it just think about it but don't forget we are giving power in authority to cast every unclean Spirit out brother was here the other time and that was a topic he went to I'm not going that way tonight I mean this morning praise be to God so it's a choice if you want to entertain the spirit but remember as a child of God you are giving power and authority over every unclean spirit in your life don't sit down and entertain it or entertain them so those evil spirits when they are cast out and you clean the house and the house is left unoccupied they are coming back and if you had seven and all of them have to go back and bring more seven more wicked ones guess how many you have at the end of the day that is a terrible place to be isn't it and I see that the house is occupied Hallelujah they can't get in but that is why the battle starts that is where the Bible starts that is why the Mind battles us because they cannot get in doesn't mean that the virus has ended I'm tempted to go ahead of myself praise be to God the father they can't get in doesn't mean that it is over they are going to come at you in every way possible in every way possible and when they die when the enemies came and God told Moses tell the people to move forward let them move forward that they may see the glory of God and whatever situation you find yourself just keep moving forward anyone that puts his hand to the plow and tears back it's not worthy of the Gospel forward ever backward never we have not come this far only to go back we are in it for good after the Lord comes and we are out of here there is no stopping place but the sun says I have decided to follow Jesus don't not go with me yet I will follow when everyone else decides to go back and you are left alone keep going forward if you can't walk anymore and you have to crawl if you want to see the salvation of the Lord keep going forward and we saw we saw how did the Lord open the Red Sea and they went through it and pharaoh and his army all got drowned in it now we have been so privileged so privileged that we don't just talk about it because God allowed the camera to capture Angel of the Covenant Halloween over the prophet that we know for a surety now wherever this message of the Lord Jesus Christ goes it is it is a prophet's message it is not brother branham's message it is the message of the Lord Jesus Christ a life-changing message praise be to God there is so much power in this world my goodness if you want to be an overcomer just keep feeling on the way you would not know when those demons live you wouldn't know when you would just look around and you can't find them anymore praise be to God that angel that angel of the Covenant praise be to God look wherever you go that angel of the Covenant is there wherever this message goes this Angel of the Covenant is there praise be to God and if you want to see the salvation of the Lord the Bible says by day they were led by the pillar of cloud By Night by the pillar of fire and we have that Pillar of Fire behind us Lord praise be to God and just keep marching forward just keep marching forward do your part as a child of God there is a path that is God's Own Part you cannot do that for God just leave that for God just do what you're supposed to do what you are called to do keep marching forward and see the arm of God in your life Batman praise be to God the Bible says there as many of them that went to the Red Sea Under the cloud on the on the on under the cloud were baptized unto Moses so that is baptism now when you have come into this life as Sinner and you have done all those useless things those unprintable things so those despicable things and God has redeemed you and you have given your life to Christ you have become a new creation you have been baptized you are justified by faith now you are walking in the newness of your mind now it is not the Holy Ghost baptism but it is the work brother said the water baptism justification is a work of the Holy Ghost praise be to God you are Justified now they entered into the wilderness and that was the most challenging time of their Journey the most challenging time of their Journey a journey that was meant to last three days lasted 40 years that they kept on going in circles over and over over and over tempting God here and there go to Kadesh Banya when Moses chose one General is from every family and they went into the land spider land and they came back and 10 of them gave an evil report and when they gave that evil report all the children of Israel just started crying shouting and murmuring and complaining and God said no I have taken it too much this is why they'll be the art of the 2 million out of the 2 million that left Egypt only true enter the Promised Land the rest that went in were those that were born in the way it's a good thing to come out by coming up is not an indication that you have made it you can come out and still perish yeah you can get out all right it's a good thing until you enter his rest never rest we can see that in a lost wife before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah When Love left with his wife and two children on the way they were asked do not turn back lost wife turned back to see what was going on and we know the story she never made it she came out but she didn't make it keep examining your life by the word examining your life by day and By Night by the word we are in an age why people have itchy ears that they want to hear good things about themselves there is nothing wrong when you are told good things about yourself that is good but as a matter of fact sometimes you even know that people are lying to you imagine and somebody comes your brother Dan you have a small beautiful ear hey you know your eyes your ear is big thank you thank you for watching the fellow just deceived you and we have itchy ears and I tell you you are living right you are doing good we buy into it we buy into it keep examining your life not by somebody else's life um says normies are special this morning he said those that compare themselves to others are not wise and she said it is silly for you to compare yourself to another person you are unique and special don't desire to be like somebody else be happy Who You Are what are somebody else is happy with you or not you be happy all right if you are not happy with you or for whatever reason that is their cup of tea they can drink it they can put in the refrigerator whatever they want to do with it that is their cup of tea you'll be happy with what God has made you people have itchy we don't want to have anything to do with the truth we want to live by lives examine yourself on a daily basis by the word if you come to church and you sit down and you hear the word of God preached under the power and the anointing of the Holy Spirit and you get up and you walk through the window I mean you walk out through the door and you didn't get anything from the service it is the most beautiful scene it's a very very uh what word do I use it's just a terrible state to be in that of all the things that was said nothing was there for you nothing was there for you praise be to God we are being led by the word and wherever this message goes remember that Pillar of Fire is still here following that message keep moving forward if you want to see the salvation of the Lord the place where a lot of us fail is when we get to that level that's sanctification level the hardest part of the journey that is why a lot of us give up that is why a lot a lot of us through our our hands in the air in despair it is the most difficult the most difficult part of the journey that things you have done in the past they keep coming after you and not only come after you but coming to take you back into the era into that life into that field you were living before that you keep struggling and fighting and you hear voices telling you to do something and you have the word now telling you know a terrible should not do this and you struggle with it you struggle with it you go you fight yourself day in day out you are sick in the face of God and you get to a place and you can hear the devil telling you or you are not never going to make it you are not a child of God have you forgotten the things you did oh come on and he knows why to press the buttons he knows what buttons to press and he can just mess your day up in one second and then get you just crying you know I mean put you in a very awful state the Devil is a fighter that is why you ought to mean business with God the Devil is a fighter because if I know I am coming to fight you and I see that you are stronger than me and I know you're going to bloody me I will not come right but when the devil knows that his legs are going to go up in the air he will still come he's never tired he never gives up he is a fighter that is why the Bible says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the words of their testimony no man is a match for the enemy but by the grace of God praise be to God to God we cannot withstand any child of God when you know your place as a child of God and when you have taken your position amen the devil is no match the devil is no match praise be to God the reason why we kept being tossed about here and there is because a lot of the times we forget Who We Are that is if we know who we are and sometimes we don't even know who we are sometimes we think we do situations come and then we begin to doubt problems would always come the storms will always come the storms when they come against you as a child of God it's just meant to make you stronger sometimes the storm is so strong like that Prophet gave an illustration then stop can come and take a tree on the other side and yes the tree would go down and sometimes you even see the roots coming up but guess what it has just losing the soil under that plant under that tree it's just going to develop extra roots to regroup the Sun and then it's just making the tree strong a storm when a storm comes against you as a child of God that storm is meant to make you stronger take your position take your position know who you are as a child of God praise be to God a lot of the times we fail in our Wilderness Journey and then we complain we mama we keep going in circles we keep going in circles job said naked I came and naked I will go back yes whatever you have in this life whatever that it is that you have acquired in this life the devil said that's the dusts why are you going with those things you are not going back with anything and if the family says oh we love this man so much or we love this brother so much we love this sister so much you know what let us put some good bars in that coffin and go and bury him you know what they have done you at the service because there are grave looters when you think you are resting at peace they will come and dig you out take that gold bar out and they are not going to bury you again they will leave you there for the vultures to come and take care praise the Lord foreign are you going with it you are never going to go with it anyhow my brother brother said that naked we get weak but we are going something that is character we are going back with character a character doesn't come when you sit in the chair and cross your legs and you are sipping coffee in the morning character character yeah it's not a gift character you struggle you got three truth is the Bible says that Jesus lent obedience by that is he suffered and that is character you learn character by the things you suffer by the things you go through you are learning character it is not an easy thing it's not an easy Journey it is something that when you are going through you have sleepless nights you would cry your prayer prayer praise love God is not hearing you you come out you wash your face people see you wonderful countenance but behind there you know what you're going through you know the storm that the devil has Unleashed against you you know the trials that you are going through God is building character in You by those things we are going with something better development it's not an easy thing we are going through things because there is something in US that must come out the child of God that you are must come out now people can look at you and they see nothing by the word of God they don't have to read the Bible they look at you and they see the Bible they look at you they see the message they look at you and they see Christ that is when the world has taken effect in your life praise be to God the children of Israel were taken across the Jordan God had given them the land but guess what they fought for every inch of the ground the promise was this you say that oh there were there were double size they were hitters there were there were they were amalekites they were all those types there were all of them on that line and it was theirs that land was not yes that was not for the jeopard size it was not for the hitters it was not for the invite no they were squatters when they were born and they were coming to this land did they bring land The God Who created the Heaven and Earth said that I give you this land I'm giving it to your descendants and that settless it praise be to God there was quarters the true land owners now have come but they had to fight for every inch of the ground the Bible says from the days of John the Baptist the kingdom of God suffered violence and the violence tuckered by force the promise is ours but don't think that you're going to unfold your arms sit on the fence and expect us to happen you have to be in the arena you have to fight your way out praise be to God never thought they fought to entrain themselves and guess what after fighting for the land they still have to fight to keep the land after today Israel is still fighting every day every single day when you look at the map of Israel on all the land portions they are surrounded by five Arab Nations and on the west is the Mediterranean Sea and those Nations that are surrounding them are not friends they are enemies they are fighting every single day to keep that land they don't go to bed and close to eyes they'll go to bed with one eye open that is why they are still on that land they are on their legs they are under alerts they are far above their enemies and they are always on the watch there are days that the Hezbollah and the the what is the other group he's bullying um yes they can fly over a thousand rockers in one day over a thousand Rockets into the land of Israel and when they fly it oh the Iron Dome will do to meet it in the air and destroy it it has a 98 success rate that all those iron domes I mean all those misses they send across to meet it in the end destroy destroy every day they are fighting to keep that land praise be to God has not brought it out of that life of Darkness out of that life of evil out of that life of sin God has not brought it from through justification only to leave us there no no he goes forward with us true sanctification and God would not bring you through sanctification and just leave you there no you must go forward to get the Holy Ghost baptism we are not a foolish virgin as a matter of fact the foolish virgin doesn't even know that she's a foolish virgin to whom much is given much shall be required don't deceive yourself that if you don't make it oh you are going to be a foolish virgin no you know better than that you know better than that to be a foolish virgin we have a line of inheritance bird did not bring them out of captivity only to leave them before the Jordan he took them across for them to inherit their blessing and God will not bring you out of justification you go to certification and God leaves you there no we have a promise God has given us a promise the promise of the Holy Ghost and you have to get the Holy Ghost baptism their promise is ours praise be to God don't come to church and then you look at some people and think that they are so special and that the Holy Ghost is just meant for this class of people and I am out no we all have a demon in our life we are fighting don't think that somebody else is a Superman there is no a Superman in the house of God the only Superman is Christ be to God one time my wife had a job somewhere in uh Burnsville I've forgotten where we're living at the time I have always been an Uber driver even before Uber came I was a Uber driver so I picked her up um I was carrying her to work uh somewhere even when I wanted the first day I knew she was not going to last on the job because I was not ready to go there the second time it was too far praise be to God so when we're going there was a church I have forgotten whether it was a Lutheran Church that was a church and there was a writing in front there and the writing ah it's a long time probably 10 nine years I don't remember and it's red that Sinners are welcome here if you are righteous there is no place for you here and it just stuck with me it just stuck with me that Sinners are welcomed here if you are righteous there's no place for you here it is not a pass for you to go and do evil it is not a pass for you to walk out and go and live in sin because Sinners are welcome here what you know to be the right thing that is what you ought you ought to do if you know something is wrong you stay away from it if you take advantage of a statement like that and then you can go out and live in sin or live in error it shows the type of seed that is in you it shows he didn't even believe to begin with when you go to the hospital you go because you are sick you don't go there on Excursion our sightseeing we come to the house of God because we are coming to examine ourselves coming to hear the word of God you don't know sitting under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and here in the word of God you're so feeding on the word sometimes we underestimate what God is doing in our lives the chains are broken habits are destroyed use it on a sickness leave as I've said before it's not only one they pray for you but when you sit down and you are here in the word of God feeding on the word habits leave sickness is leaf demons vanish just sitting down sometimes we see it as a sacrifice when we are coming to the house of God we should see it more as a blessing see it more as a blessing does something in your life can just pick you up wake you up in the morning when something is saying no you are too tired just enjoy your sleep something in Utah you know we are going to the house of the Lord today you should count it a blessing because not very many people have experienced that praise be to God a parallel looking at how God deals with the children of Israel taking them out of captivity to their Promised Land and superimposing on so by opposing that unto what God has done in our lives taking us out of captivity bringing us through justification through sanctification and into the promise of the Holy Ghost and you should know by now as I've already said that when you have the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean that the barrel ends there the Holy Ghost comes straight into the soul now when the Holy Ghost comes into the soul guess what the Holy Ghost is surrounded by the Flesh on every side [Music] and as your spirit man surrounds the Holy Ghost your soul and this is square in the greatest battle forts the brother brother I'm talking about the Mind battles the Devil Comes and he goes through the five senses of your spirit he just goes through your imagination your sense of imagination boom and then you are sitting here and you are 10 000 miles away and then your mind is wandering somewhere and then before you're aware you're already out of service and you are thinking of things you shouldn't think about things that will wear you out things that will destroy your life you sit down and you begin to imagine things the devil can just enter your reasoning and then just come against you can enter through your memory through your affection through the five senses of the spirit what is the devil doing the devil can never go in there to unseat God but the devil is trying to create a confidence problem where you would lose confidence in the word of God and just turn away from the word now the devil has the control to come in and possess you but you know what keep moving forward ever backward never God has not brought us this far only to leave us alone and we have not come this far only to turn back I pray God that he brings us to that point that word would have to choose between the word of God and between in our lives that we shall choose the word for me to live is Christ and to die is again praise be to God that if we have to choose between the word of God and our lives we shall choose God like three children in our bed no go they said King who will not even give this a second thought we know our Lord will Deliver Us and if he chooses not to who will not bow praise be to God if he chooses not to We Will Not Bow if you have to choose between the word and you choose choose the word we have lived too much for ourselves it's time to live for God praise be to God a parallel when the Holy Ghost has come in remember that the battle doesn't end there the barrel still continues unabated because your soul is surrounded by your spirit man surrounded by the flesh and the devil just comes in and now you have a battle going on in your mind the greatest Barrel ever fought but so long as you don't accept it here it can never find its way down here you have to fight every single day to stay in the will of God every single day when you get up in the morning and you don't get your battle you don't see your battle as the Lord is it where is it where is it send the devil my way it's a difficult thing right A lot of times we ask God take the devil away take the devil away take the devil away they should take it away praise the Lord don't ask God to take your devil away the devil is here to work for God sure oh yeah I like the way you put it when the Devil Comes it's a time for God to promote you you don't just get up from one program you enter another program just sleeping no you have to justify yourself when the travel is coming he knows he's coming for a bloody nose and then he comes anyhow because God is ready to bring you up never ask God to take the devil away ask God to give you Grace to overcome the devil praise be to God the parable parallel I'm very mindful of the time I will not keep you here longer than I should um praise be to God um thank you we should be out of here by 1 30 it's not a promise though the praise be to God but I'll keep that in mind yes so brother Brown says that without a holy ghost your soul is lost you know let me just skip [Music] um okay okay so the only way to be on the alerts is to stay in prayer like I was just using that example that the children of Israel I only elect they don't sleep with their two eyes closed the only way to stay on the alert is to be in constant prayer that's why the Bible says that pray with that season God gave us the best weapon the best weapon that a child of God could ever have over the enemy God gave it to us but it kind of looks so simple so simple that sometimes we hardly even believe it that you can go on your knees and you meet prayer with you mean business with God and things will change there is power in prayer and as I said one time that during the prayer series something jumped out at me that there is no special time for prayer that every prayer time is a special time it doesn't matter what you have behind the steering wheel it doesn't matter whether you're at home it doesn't matter whether you're on your knees it doesn't matter what just be sincere enough there isn't enough sincerity we forget that we are dealing with a god who sees us from the inside who we truly are there isn't enough sincerity and because of that we don't see much of God the only way to be on the alert is my prayer and keep yourself in the word at all times praise be to God pray without season pray in and out of season and it's very difficult a lot of the times that when people are out of season when things have happened when your heart is broken when you are shattered when you are going through the storm you hardly find strength to go before the Lord and brothers presence is this this is where we ought to be praying for one another intercessory prayer is a very good thing to do intercessory prayer a lot of the times it's just me me me my family my family my family I I am pray and ask God to put a burden on your heart for somebody else you may never know what somebody else is going through we are here to Bear one another's infirmities the Bible says that let he that is strong bear the infirmities of the weak [Music] not to chastise them not to bring them down not to make them feel less human not to make them feel useless bear their infirmities be a shoulder a shoulder they can cry oh yeah praise Beauty God praise the Lord so the Holy Spirit would testify of a would not testify anything other than the word and brother Abraham says that assures evidence that a man has the Holy Ghost as living by every word living by every word not some not some of the word but living by every word that is the surest sign that you have the Holy Ghost baptism we are not against speaking in tongues we are not against all those we are not against that but there are people that speak in tongues interpret tongues Miracle science and wonders and yet they don't have the Holy Ghost that is not a sign that you have the Holy Ghost baptism the surest sign that you have the Holy ghosts of God why because the Holy Ghost would never turn himself against his own word they will never the Holy Ghost will never tell him he sat back on his own word it's it's impossible it can never happen not in this life not in the Life to Come if you want to know you surely have the Holy Ghost you believe in every word I remember talking to a guy at work one time he said he was he didn't say is he said he was an associate uh minister ah Baptist no not Baptist he was an associate pastor in a church and I was happy meeting him because at work it's difficult to get somebody to talk about church the people are okay when you're talking about stupid things but if it has to do with the word of God they have a problem with it so when you test somebody that says they believe in the word it's just a source of encouragement that you are for I have met my brother we can talk about God I met his brother and then we started talking and I wanna when I bring a scripture he will take it and run with it I bring a scripture take it around with it and then we're just going going sometimes I ask him so you say you were you were a pastor what happened I said no we just started this conversation let me know go too quick before I lose this friend so we've got to a point and then he asked so what do you believe then I started sharing with him I asked him I said did he ever hear of that prophet of God brother Branham he said no I said it's amazing he was an American but a lot of us Africans knew more about him than the Americans and then I started then he was kind of confused a little so I started to Atwater baptism and then that was why the problem came he didn't understand I couldn't get him to understand the baptism was in the name of Father's son Holy Ghost he was holding on to the titles and I tried to get you to understand and I told him that baptism in the title is a wrong baptism if you were ever baptizing the titles you have to go and baptize again so this guy now just went back into his shelves sure and I didn't know I lost him until we met the following week I saw him coming and I said to myself oh my brother's coming and I was smiling I call him his face was I said oh it's time to back off and I stayed a safe distance because at work you know these people as I said oh he's harassing me with the word of God it's something that can happen praise be to God this is somebody that was an associate pastor that probably may have baptized people in the title of father son Holy Ghost now you hear the word of God and you know it is the truth and yet you can't take it but they will tell you that they have the Holy Ghost baptism maybe they have a ghost of a thought but one thing we do know that God would never tell him himself against his word the Holy Ghost would say nothing but the word of God and if you want to know you truly have the Holy Ghost baptism you believe in every word of God praise be to God you have no problem you may have some difficult areas in your life that you will get to a point and the way you are seeing things are different and somebody comes and tells you brother you got this wrong he said no I never got it from he said come this is what the Bible says or this is what the prophet says oh I'm sorry I didn't know it was this I never saw it that way and what do you do you go before the Lord in prayer father forgive me I didn't know I'm sorry but not to not not to condemn or Rise Against the word no that means that it's a problem in your life praise be to God yes Clark says I'm left in 15 minutes praise be to God so the Holy Ghost would never deny the word of God and the Bible says that grave nuts the Holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed unto the day of your Redemption on a day of your Redemption now reading from the prophet why did I take this from um well let's read now the Holy Spirit is the seal now if you say you believe and haven't received the Holy Ghost then God's has never recognized your faith yet because the seal is a recognition that God has completed and finished his work in you praise be to God that he recognized sure someone said why should you make it so loose Branham Saint John 5 24 that's the beginning of the spirit that's right I believe that amen that a man as soon as you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is a portion of the Holy Spirit when you are sanctified another portion of the Holy Spirit cleanses you then you are filled with the Holy Ghost praise be to God now talking about the seal of a finished work is just like I mean those of you who have waited in factory settings or whatever before a company puts his seal on anything it signifies a completed work they got their raw materials they refine it they'll go through the production system they have a quality Wing that comes and in space and make sure everything is why it's supposed to be and then they'll put the company's seal on it is showing a finished work so when you have the Holy Ghost is God put in his seal on you that you are a finished work you are finished work praise be to God now when the company pulls that work or that material or that product in a semi and the summer goes and it involves in an accident it so doesn't change anything the bosses can break the product inside can can destroy it is still a finished work when God has put his seal on you when you have the Holy Ghost baptism in your soul you are a finished work it doesn't matter what happens afterward in a car crash the plane goes up and ends up in the sea it doesn't matter what happens you are a finished work and brother Branham says somewhere I don't have it down here that without the Holy Ghost baptism you are not even a Christian to begin with it doesn't mean that God is not working in your life there are studies God is good God is taking you through he will surely bring you on to an expected end there is no doubt about it if you put your trust in God God Will Never Let You Down do not let your faith in God keep wandering it doesn't matter what you go through knowing who you are as a child of God praise be to God settles it that settless it praise be to God I just want to read a few things here but I am I I let me stay on it I have 10 more minutes to go praise be to God as soon okay third year of my life my life there's only one type of it that's God's life now we notice that Cain he made an altar he put a sacrifice on it he got down and he confessed his faith in God he worshiped God in other words just like the religious man the religious men today 99 out of 100 almost they say here it is it is the best I can do Ken said this I built an altar I belong here to church I made a sacrifice this is the best I can do take it or leave it is that not how we behave sometimes you know you have to come by God's provided way there is a way that he might write unto a man by the end is death do not lean on your own understanding lead on the word of God even where you don't understand you don't have to understand to live by it live by it because it is the word of God that is the behavior sometimes you don't verbalize it but by your life that is what you are saying this is the best I can do take it or leave it you must come by God's provided way you must come according to the way God has ordained it if there is anything good coming out it must be according to God's provided way Yahweh would provide nothing by Death does the attitude of people today I go to church I help them do everything we build a nice building we we are we're done with all this we we um I put into the widows fund I do all this there it is the best I can do take it or leave it God will live it he left it there for Cain he will leave it there for you there is a wider him right onto a man by the end thereof is the way of death there is only one provided word for God that is down the bloodstream to the Holy Spirit without that you are done this is nuts to threaten you the truth a lot of the times it's not easy to swallow and we don't sugarcoat it make it look nice so you can take it in and feel good no but a brother says somewhere that he is obligated to tell you the truth but he is not obligated to what you do with the word and that is why every preacher ought to be I'm obligated by the grace of God to tell you what I know is the truth of the word amen whatever you choose to do with it is no longer my promise even though I would encourage you take God at this word praise be to God that would be my only encouragement to you take God by his word praise God and the prophet said so he started threatening you this is just mine not to threaten you um so uh you will never accept a man be born again he can in no wise enter into the kingdom that's right you must come no matter how religious you are what all you do that has not one thing to do that makes you a pretty good citizen but not a citizen of that Kingdom day maybe of this Kingdom Here by the kingdom of God is within you you are born in the Kingdom the kingdom comes in the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit you belong to that Kingdom that's the reason women don't bark their hair don't wear shorts that's the reason men don't smoke cigarettes and think like that they are from above their Spirit teaches them righteousness holiness they don't swear they don't use bad language and tense why they are born from above they are they are different citizens from above and now notice the world they say well I belong to church and what what have you children of God do not sway children of God you're the young ones here you go to school you hear people even at work people cursing Loosely talking Loosely they say things do not be partakers of other people's sin children of God don't talk Loosely you don't curse you don't swear foreign for God did rest on the Sabbath day and he said as he said in a certain place another time uh today after so long a time when you hear the voice hiding not your heart then if Jesus would have given them another Sabbath he had have afterward spoke of it but there remaineth a Sabbath keeping to the people of God for we which have entered into his rest have ceased from our works like God did from his you'll get to that point life is no longer about you you think of God more than you think about yourself you've had enough of you hmm sure you just want to please God in everything you want God to be in your life when you take a step you you want to see God taking a step with you you are sure of his presence praise be to God when we do enter into his rest okay um now he says he says now you with pencils turn with me to Isaiah 28 8-12 you can read that later here's where you get it precepts must be upon precepts lying upon line here a little there a little hold fast to that which is good for with stammering lives and with other tongues will I speak to my people and this is the Sabbath this is the risk that I said would come and for all this they would not work away work in their heads and so forth he said that the seal of the finished of salvation through justification uh Lutheran justification Wesley sanctification but when the Sabbath come the real rest day it will be when stamron lives and other tanks will I speak to the people to these people and this is the finished work this is the seal this is the Sabbath don't you see it is the Holy Ghost brother that is when you enter into the finished work if you've just been Justified that's all right that's good if you've been Sanctified that's good but when you receive the Holy Ghost it's a finished work and God have completed his Plan of Salvation and sealed it with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen praise be to God now holy ghost baptism is a promise to the children of God that in the lives that you pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh it's a promise and keep remembering remind yourself I don't know why this cup keeps coming over and over our time is off that if you were to see the salvation of the Lord keep marching forward when you look at the the Bible says that will wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities rulers of this Dark World evil spirits forces of Darkness right and the Bible goes on to say that put on the whole armor of God put on the whole armor of God now when you look at the armor of God I'm not going in that step but you have a helmet or salvation you have a breastplate of righteousness and the Bible says get your lines with the truth and your feet shut in the prepression of the gospel of peace and you have in your hand The Shield of faith and the sword of the spirit so when you look at it so long as you are Marching forward you are protected because from the head right down to your feet you are protected back on your back when you tend to run away the devil takes you never put your hand to the plow and turn back you become a feast for the devil so long as you keep marching forward you are victorious marching forward forward pray with us easy keep matching forward be led by the Holy Spirit keep marching forward anywhere you find yourself we are two minutes above time praise be to God um I think normally we even leave you around too yeah I will leave you around you praise be to God no I'm not good I'm still going to stay with my time I'm just going to borrow a little time praise be to go yes so um okay so in closing the musicians can come over that means that I'm serious praise be to God yeah so the Bible says here in John 17 17 power against unclean spirits again we are given power over unclean spirits praise be to God now whatever condition you find yourselves in you are not supposed to just sit down and accept it don't sit down and accept it you are a fighter you are a fighter we said the Devil is a fighter yes he is May you are a fighter the devil can never overcome a child of God praise be to God [Music] you commit the devil 32. don't surrender your grounds don't surrender your grounds if you have to die so be it but if you have to die die as a child of God we don't smoke peace pipe with the Devil praise be to God they went out and called The Devils and they came back rejoice in the combat rejoicing and said don't Rejoice Jesus telling them because you cast out devils and they are subject to you but Rejoice that your nails written in heaven praise be to God we are Heavenly Creatures we don't belong here [Music] any spirit that tells you that Lord you are bound to this earth is the spirit of the devil we are not bound here we are children of God we come from heaven and we go back to heaven there is no doubt Know Who You Are Know Who You Are what you go through the things you go through do not define you they don't Define you they should be in your real View Mirror by now [Music] and keep matching forward [Music] God is going to bring us all to an expected end the children of Israel inherited their promise [Music] God is never going to leave you or abandon you he has promised I'll be with you always and he has kept his word the Bible says that we are already seated in Heavenly places through Christ Jesus we are we are it's just a matter of time and will defy gravity it's just a matter of time foreign Spirits are we baptized into one body struggle to enter in the day that is why the blessings are strive to go in there don't take any excuse stay in behind we are already seated in Heavenly places through Christ Jesus there is Joyce that your names are written in heaven I want to ask you something the prophet is asking my brother if your names if your name is written in heaven okay the mark of the beast and the Seal of God um number number two I think paragraph eight and I'm not sure does that still do it it's have no sign no indeed Judas was right with them Judas was just as big a duck in the puddle as the rest of them was he came right along through justification went out through sanctification prayed for the sick had great results but when it come to Pentecost he showed his colors and that's exactly what a denominational churches has done today they've come through justification sanctification but when it comes to the Holy Ghost when it comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that bunch of tongues and signs and wonders and angers appearing and so forth they don't want nothing to do with it so the so that's where is so close together it had deceived the very elect if possible so what are we talking about this morning or we close in two minutes this message was just meant to bring us onto our inheritance which the father himself gives it doesn't come from any man it doesn't come from the church it doesn't come from anybody it's a promise that God himself has made to the to bring us to know and assess where we are in our journey with God that you can look at your life and ask yourself where am I where am I in my walk with God where am I because God knows where you are no brother knows no sister knows but you know where you are it's not a time to God before God and try to sugarcoat your language no it's not a time for grammar just go to God and speak to God Just As You Are Just As You Are praise be to God and the Bible said will she work out our our salvation with fear and trembling this is not a time to relax and always remember that The Closer you get the harder it becomes the closer you get the harder it becomes don't expect it to be easy if it becomes easy praise God for it but don't expect it the closer you get the harder it comes something must take us out of here it's like somebody an athlete an athlete maybe you are running um any race at all let's take it maybe 800 meters you go through the field two times when you are getting to the middle Zone that is when it gets harder that is when people are falling back and that is why people persevere they are tired but they don't give up that failure giving up but they don't give up they are looking at the Finishing Line and they keep pressing on till the cross they never stop because of Christ they never rests so the closer you are getting to the Finishing Line the harder it becomes but that is where you ought to persevere that is not a time to throw in the towel that is the time to persevere prayers be to God so remember that The Closer you get the harder is going to be or the harder is going to become but it's designed to be that way praise be to God it's now going to get soft okay so again let us all pray that we are not left in the wilderness as you keep your eyes on the promise keep in constant prayer and always let the word be in your hearts in your heart anything you treasure entertain your treasure foreign [Music] as you keep a constant prayer keep the word in your heart as you are being led by the Holy Spirit into every promise of God and this brings us right down so that three sacred virtues of the church Brian talks about which brother one has been preaching about for some time prayer the word and the Holy Ghost stay in constant prayer stay in constant prayer whether you are in season or out of season stay in constant prayer hide a word in your heart treasure it above your personal
