========================================

[Music] so so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] brought into judgment because it happened about 80 70 when the great uh roman general titus besieged jerusalem about 80 70 with his army from rome and there they paid the price for rejecting him today as we look upon that trial there and we go out here and impersonate it in different ways of trials on good friday and talk about it and things and the very same thing that we are talking about happening on that good friday is right under our noses today and our elders are doing the same thing they did taking it right in on a similar trial after a similar promised word of this day has been vindicated just the same as it was vindicated there jesus a common carpenter's boy so thought he was the word of god made manifest and he was thoroughly identified because the works of god had manifested himself through him and prove that he was the messiah the day that similar cases come again when the holy spirit has come upon us in the last days and identified himself right in our church and has proven the same works that he did when he was sharing the fullness upon jesus christ he did the same thing upon the bride doing the same thing and still we want to get rid of it remember these are tapes it's made now that goes over the world not only to phoenix here i'm speaking to half of the world at this time because we've got a tape business that goes around the world notice today we have a similar trial after the same identified word hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and forever saint john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also matthew 28 all the world preach the gospel to every creature lol while the world says be no more yet ye shall see me for i will be with you even in you to the end of the age jesus christ the same yesterday and forever they have chosen today not only a murder but a murder of the word a satellite to the very first murder when the apostles was preaching the gospel and come down through irenaeus and many of the great reformers and founders back in the early age they come to nice one time for a showdown and they decided to make a universal church to force people to come under their jewish diction many who's read the history there knows many old prophets come there with animal skin wrapped around them eating only herbs and things and they tried to hold out for that word hold for the word of god but what did they do that 15 days of bloody politics they finally decided to make a universal church and grant some paganism with christianity and set it out as a universal church and today the protestants are throwing themselves together in the ecumenical council doing the same thing grafting tradition of man instead of taking the word of god which is thoroughly identified by the holy ghost that he's the same yesterday today and forever the church stands in the bounds today and found wanting you're back in pilate's judgment hall yes sir what does it do it's making an image unto the beast it's a satellite underwrong when the ecumenical council is forcing in will force every protestant denomination doing it practically always there now full gospel and all the hour's going to come when they'll have to come or stand and at that time when that force come you've already identified yourself with the mark of the beast oh that's exactly what is it a protestant harlots with the old mother roamed the revelation 17 said she was a mother of harlots exactly protestant denominations holding out in her hand the cup of the wrath of the of god for her toast her testimony this is what we believe in each one this what we believe here's what the church is to believe the word of god and let every man's word be alive that's what it's supposed to be but we bring christ again to that great crucial hour that he stood in the pilot's judgment hall pathetically a little bunch pushed off to one side with a bowed head other denominations rejected them refused them and turned them away and said have nothing to do with it you better check up on the word now we find out this uh ecumenical council is what's it doing the bible he said does the bible say about this having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof naked church goers having a form of godliness but denying the power of the holy ghost which identifies jesus christ to his word how can a man claim to have the holy spirit and deny the very word which is the holy spirit how can a man do that his own testimony gives witness that he's not what he's supposed to be committing spiritual fornications denying the power of god paul said in second timothy third chapter that's what it would be said be heady high-minded i've got a doctor's degree at phdld to me that's further from god he was when you started yes that only takes you away from god don't bring you to god only one thing can draw you to god and that's the holy spirit by his word the holy spirit is a compass the north star is the word and the compass will only point to the north star and the holy ghost will only point you to the word not some ecumenical move not some denomination but to the word of god remember all the other stars shift with the world but the north star stays exactly because it's in the center and every other man's world will fail but god's word can't fail it's a north star centered it won't shift with the world no matter where the world is it remains the same yesterday today and forever and he is the word brother and sister i plead you in jesus name to consider this you believe me in what i've said in these years if god has proof what i've said has been the truth not me it's been his word that's done it then i plead you in jesus name to check on this don't be blind to these things it's right upon you remember the bible said in matthew 24 24 that all whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation the earth would take this mark only in the elected who's ordained to see it we'll see it the rest of them missing a million miles we see this big move set up now satan's big machinery set in order the only thing it needs is it's got the mechanics that only waiting for its dynamics to put it in force the moves all congregation a big council and they the big machines sitting there but they're waiting for the hour when the lead goes down and then they can make it enforce it make it a law look at the broadcasts and things we hear today over the radio and the newspapers why it's right on you now we haven't time to do nothing else but receive jesus christ he's been thoroughly identified listen we say about satan's big machine up there ready to move that's right to crush down but remember god's little flock that believes the word its mechanics is ready too it's ready for the dynamics to set it a fire with the holy ghost fear not little it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom the holy ghost will strike the little churches come out from the world women it wears long hair and nazarite to prove they separate themselves from the nazarite is one who what uh one that separates themselves from the word of god not sharp wearing painted faces jezebels calling themselves christians no sir man so wishy-washy that'll stand for a denomination to hold on to their coattails or some caesar or herod instead of standing for the word of god but god's got loyal people genuine luck of god who don't care what the world says they believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever this is not popular it makes you unpopular but it's the truth it's god's command for it to be done and god will do it god bless you i don't mean to scold you but to warn you it's better to be scorched and burned at any time so take warning the holy spirit speaks in the desires days always written in the book will escape it now we find out the little flock is ready for the dynamics to move it up in the skies to escape all this tribulation someone said the other day and i was talking said brother abraham you don't believe then the church will go through the tribulation i said i believe the church will but not the bride the church will go through the tribulation yes sir but the bride's free from it all that's written in the book will escape it now we find out the little flock is ready for the dynamics to move it up in the skies to escape all this tribulation someone said the other day and i was talking said brother abraham you don't believe then the church will go through the tribulation i said i believe the church will but not the bride the church will go through the tribulation yes sir but the bride's free from it she'll go on the rapture in a moment in a twinkling of an hour she'll be caught up to meet her lord in the air for the wedding supper she has nothing to go through any tribulation about her lord has paid her price we're so thankful for that yes sir after the rejects of both church and nation there was only one cry come the next move let's get rid of it that's the next cry we have the church has firmly turned down the holy spirit we know it has all members has come out of everything that's the great call presbyterian methodist baptist lutheran but the church itself the denomination it cannot move no sir it's already denominated what's the thing of it is now crucified crucify what crucifying afresh what the authenticated word to be the truth god's word crucify the flesh just as eve corrupted the whole physical world by rejecting one little bit of god's word so has the church did the same thing you may say to me brother branham you've got the wrong interpretation of it well that's to your opinion god don't need any interpreter god's his own interpreter that's what the trouble of it is today we got too many man-made interpreters god can interpret himself his own vindication of his word is the interpretation the pharisees might have cried out too we got the interpretation of sadducees says we got it but jesus was the interpretation amen the manifestation of god's revealed power promise is the vindication read the scriptures and see what the church is supposed to be today yes sir god don't need any interpreter let's say what they've done to jesus they found out back there that they thought he didn't have the interpretation he was the interpretation god didn't have to interpret it jesus life interpreted he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life they are they that testify me and if i do not the works of my father then believe me not if the works that we spoke of this day don't manifest itself in me he said then don't believe it did they do it god said a virgin shall conceive and she did you believe it certainly but they didn't a virgin shall conceive and she did it said the lame shall walk the blind shall see and what would take place it proved they would do it and jesus was a manifestation moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like unto me the word comes to the prophet and the prophet the word is a discerner of the thoughts of the heart when they see him doing that discernment they said this is beelzebub a fortune teller that's no more than a name depend on him the same thing today called a holy roller or something like that that's right though he needs no interpretation he was the interpretation god proved it by himself who is that sinful man today or who was that sinful man then that would deny that the word wasn't interpreted jesus asked them said search the scriptures they testify who i am they are the interpretation if my life doesn't interpret what i'm talking about then don't believe me what sinful man could there be today that could look in the face of the bible and see if the holy spirit isn't the interpreter of the word today making himself known by manifestations of promises of the gifts and the things that he promised to do in this day malachi 4 being fulfilled all the rest of scripture is being fulfilled and see it right here at the end of the time you don't need any man to interpret it no sir it interprets itself it proves it's the message of the hour repent and turn to god all the world you churches repent and turn to god don't try to wash him from your hands because you can't do it the issue is right on eyes it was in he said search the scriptures they testify me jesus said my works are my interpreter he told moses when he met him up there at the burning bush he said i am i remember my promise i remember that i'd take them people out by a mighty hand i made the promise and i'm going with you i'm sending you you just be my mouthpiece and the signs will interpret whether i sent you or not amen that's what men and women of another exodus and an interpretation of god's word being made manifest trouble with that today they say well my church don't believe this what's the matter you're living in a shadow of another age that churches are fine in their ages but what about this age this is another age you never make wesley believe on luther there wasn't sanctification no sir you never make the pentecostal believe on the baptise or like that go back to that they found something better they lived in the light of their day and today pentecost has organized and set right down like they did exactly the same thing and the words moving on and it's moving right away from them it's exactly ryan because we get so stiff and so starch we let our churches get in any kind of condition go right on as long as we got members that's always necessary because we got more we ever had we blow about that let me tell you something old proverb that the devil counts his crowd but gog weighs his that's true too yesterday but we should by his word see if you're found morning or not i don't care about crowds how many is how important it is it's god's word being made manifest for this hour exactly ryan we'll care about crowds and who comes and who doesn't it's god's words at stake like it was there in pilot's judgment hall wait and see what we found where we found wanting yes sir we believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday forever we find out that he told moses that i'll be with you and i'll just use your amount you go speak the words as i tell you and the signs will interpret themselves see god don't need no interpreter oh no he must be interpreter god interpret proves himself he said that he was the interpreter of his own word and he is he did it by moses and he does it today we know him in the bible as elohim elohim is the all-sufficient one he needs nobody's advice he stands alone he's god and he is the word and when the word promises something makes it identified before you what kind of an interpretation do you want outside of that oh sinful man or woman who are you that can rise up and say that it's wrong when god with his holy spirit and promised word interprets it in the face of every one of us who are we to say that it's wrong oh sinful person how can you do that sinful what do you mean by that brother branham unbelief there's only one sin that's unbelief need not still the interpretation he interprets his own i am the lord he said i planted it i'll water it day and night this sun should pluck it from my hand he also said in another scripture that he watched over his word to perform and perform it reveal it to what is elected to those that has sent the seed that's sent to see it rather he performs it to those who are sent to see it he watches over keeps it away from all these foolish carnal interpretations these things that this is right and that's right and that's right god's right god's identified person well then pharisees stood up and said we're of god we have the laws we have this and that stood the word itself said away with the crucified it don't identify itself with what we believe but it identified itself with the word amen amen those who had eyes to see saw it those who were blind did not see it neither will they do it today that's all they're going done seal themselves off many of them from away from it oh yes by fulfilling it showing it to be true some say i believe so much of it brother branham i can believe the bible i sympathize with the bible i'm a bible sympathizer i believe so and so i believe jesus christ is the son of god but i just can't believe all of it because my denomination says it's not so then what kind of an interpreter you got the same kind that eve had the devil he tried to interpret the word to eve and he said oh this is right and that's right but surely surely he's right what god says it's right i don't care how much it seems to others when god said it's going to happen it's going to be that way would you use eve's interpreter oh sinful person how could you do that yes sir they had got eve's interpreter the evidence as i've said other day we try to place evidence luther said believe and walk out the devil believes too wesley said shout you got it but he found out he didn't pentecost said speak in tongues and you got it they didn't christian science said love he got the fruit of the spirit but the heaven they denied the divinity of jesus christ what is the evidence of it when that spirit that's in you can punctuate every promise with amen that god will confirm it that's exactly the way it was with jesus christ oh yes they had they had more fruits of the spirit they had all kinds of evidences you can't pin any evidence down to anything but god himself manifests these words that's the only true evidence that there is that you're a christian how can you be a christian when in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever he was the same god that was in david is the same one as in moses he was the same one with all the apostles and he's the same one that was in jesus christ to manifest himself there for that promised work and he's saying god today the same word throwing light upon the word of the hour god be merciful to us yes siren believing god to interpret himself every word to be vindicated yes he is his own interpreter brother i think of the hour i could stay on this a long time but you got a meeting coming i believe and i'm going to say today if we don't watch he's on the hands of we americans think of it i say this not for anger i say this for life i say that the blood of jesus christ is on the hand of the american church today the blood of jesus christ is on america whole the blood of jesus christ is against the methodist presbyterian lutheran pentecostals it's on the hands of all of us let's see if it is now think of it the blood of jesus christ oh my and his pilot that day it reminds me of three ways that pilas tried to get it off his hand he tried all three ways to get it off his hand but he failed there's only one way to take it off your hand let's see what he did pilate tried these three ways and they all failed we must face the issue we know a chair for his word has been identified by the scripture evidence the word promised for the day is made flesh even to the evil part of refusing jesus christ and him in this lady of sea and age on the outside of the church we know that's the truth think of it the blood of jesus christ god's son on our hands you that scares me to think of it to run through them and send shields that think the blood of jesus christ when a man will watch his own fellow man's blood one time in chicago not long ago a friend of mine was standing there one mother the dillinger outfit or whatever was shot out on the street people gathered up by the hundreds and they stood all around but they what did they do or that blood was sped out on the street in that bullet hole everybody walked around that blood they wouldn't step in their fellow man's blood oh no sir they're very suspicious of that but they'll walk right through the blood of jesus christ this old saying is still true fool's a walk with hobnailed shoes where angels fear the tron right they'll walk right over say the days of miracles has passed that was all right for the apostles but not for us oh my how can you say it you're trapping under the foot the blood of jesus christ wherewith you were sanctified with oh my thank you the blood on her hands what a man's fellow's blood i think about long goal a few weeks ago when we thought it couldn't happen in our nation what about this fellow oswald sitting there in that cell sweating it out if he's in his right mind not think of a man that would listen to this tape or setting presence or anywhere and listen to the message of proving it sweating it out knowing that you've got to come to judgment and answer to the word of god answer to the blood of jesus christ which you've been introduced to on your hands on our hands notice oswald sitting there what an awful thing it should ought to be into him or it would have been or i guess it was when he thought that he would face an angry supreme court with the anger of murdering their president there would be no mercy any evidence they could get against me if he crammed against him fingerprints gun place he was at all to be brought before him that's a mild thing to what it's going to be the people who set these meetings once jesus christ rise in the form of his being and identify himself and you walk out without acceptance hold into some little creed or something that you call petty that'll be a mild thing when you sit in the presence of angry god who's trapped you have pranked the blood of his own son and crucified him afresh in your mind swapped your birthrights for a popularity it's going to be a terrible thing on that day it'd be a horrible thought how can you shine a sweat cell you natives in africa you in australia sweden switzerland you listen to this tape how are you going to answer in the day of judgment when i've been in your nations and you've seen the identification of jesus christ rising among the people and proving himself sweat my he must have sweated out oh how could he do it if he was in his right mind what kind of a angry god do you think it'll be to those who have trod underfoot the son of god and crucified him afresh again notice a pilot when he gets ready to take a plane up a pilot will take a plane out he'll check everything before he leaves every instrument you go out on the runway and stand out there check those wing flaps check his gasket everything every instrument he's got he checks it over and over many of his flowing in planes and you know that's the truth he checks every instrument why he's got the blood of his fellow man upon his hands he wants to be sure that everything possible is running right how about a doctor in an operation when he knows that he's going to operate take a tumor or a heart or something other than operate on it when he's going to operate on your body he'll check your heart you'll check your blood pressure he'll check whether he got any cold check the nsx he checks everything over and over and over again why you don't want the blood of his fellow man upon his hand if a doctrine of pilot and so forth will check for the church of jesus christ to do when we see the things that we're living in today we'd better check the blood of jesus christ might be left upon our hands now let's take one thing pilate's first scheme was i find no fault in him how that is amongst many of the fine groups today i find no fault in the word it's all right but that was for the apostles the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever you say that bible is all right i believe they spoke in tongues i believe they cast out devils i believe they discerned the thoughts i believe they were prophets but not this day oh mister sinful man what's the matter with you what happens when matthew 28 uh 24 24 lays right back hebrews 13 8 flies right back in your lap again pilate he couldn't wash it from his hands like that nosher come right back in his lap again so will it to every man when you stood and seen god keep his promise peter said on the day of pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost father promises unto you and your children and them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call how far to all the world every nation amen to every nation go into all the world it hasn't reached their head preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them i believe how you don't wash it from your hands you cannot do it it's a vindicated throw right back in your lap it backfires just like it did on pilate oh yes sir it comes right back to you again when you see the scripture identified right before you secondly as we're closing secondly we find out there was another way as pilate tried to do so does people they pass it on to his herods and caesars many fine ministers today episcopalian presbyterian lutheran baptist pentecostals and so forth i'll pass it on my headquarters is the one won't let me do it it backfired it's backfiring again today i'm not asking the assemblies of god the oneness the church of god the methodist the baptist the presbyterian i'm asking you as an individual what do you do with the blood of jesus christ what will we do with this anointed word of god that's right before us today that we know is to be is the christ the promise of the hour what will you do with it not what your church does with it your caesar your heart has nothing to do with it that didn't excuse pilate no sir no sir that pharisees and that day he said let his blood be upon us no our children it is exactly what did jesus tell him you can discern the face of the skies but you can't discern the signs of the time no i don't say this for a penis god said for anyone who wants to go to you blind pharisees how can you spend in millions of dollars you can discern communism but the word of god have vindicated for the hour you cannot discern you're crucifying it again you know all about communism you know your bible you know things got to happen that's not interesting to me i hate communism i hate anything against god but what my interest is is this the church being ready for this hour for the going away of the bride discern the face of the skies but the signs of the time you cannot discern an honest trial it is in the federal courts to make these council of churches and everything you can discern communism [Music] you
