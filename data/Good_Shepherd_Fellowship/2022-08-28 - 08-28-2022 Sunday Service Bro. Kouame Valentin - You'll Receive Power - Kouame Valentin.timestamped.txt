[1:44:27] and said
[1:44:29] i'm to have a baby by my wife
[1:44:32] she is 65 years old
[1:44:36] about 15 20 years past menopause
[1:44:43] what will he have done
[1:44:47] but what did he do like a skilled affair
[1:44:50] he never pay attention inappropriate
[1:44:53] attention to what the natural things
[1:44:56] worse
[1:45:15] you added we look at what god said
[1:45:17] exactly
[1:45:20] i'd like to say the way brother billy
[1:45:22] paul says
[1:45:24] he says if god thought about it
[1:45:27] um
[1:45:40] it becomes such a reality to him
[1:45:45] till he didn't see nothing else
[1:45:48] discussing every dot about what god said
[1:45:51] he said second year
[1:45:54] he left his house
[1:45:56] he separated
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:12] that's what every genuine believer has
[1:46:14] to do
[1:46:17] separate yourself from these doubters
[1:46:21] and unbelievers thank you and walk with
[1:46:23] christians
[1:46:37] we find him still believing
[1:46:52] the word
[1:47:21] the pastor completely there were a lot
[1:47:22] of things that proved that this promise
[1:47:24] would never come true
[1:47:26] all was proving that this would not
[1:47:28] happen
[1:47:32] but he caught everything that was
[1:47:33] contrary to the world
[1:47:48] let
[1:48:09] [Applause]
[1:48:16] come
[1:48:44] oh many things will happen
[1:48:48] god bless you richland
[1:48:50] shalom to you amen amen
[1:48:54] god bless you
[1:48:55] [Applause]
[1:48:56] i will stop here
[1:49:11] may the lord bless you church
[1:49:14] shalom to you
[1:49:16] amen
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:21] praise the lord
[1:49:24] hallelujah
[1:49:27] amen
[1:49:29] glory be to god
[1:49:31] you love the lord this morning
[1:49:33] amen in that same spirit that raised up
[1:49:36] jesus from the dead
[1:49:38] dwell in you
[1:49:40] it will quicken your mortal body
[1:49:42] praise the lord
[1:49:44] it will quicken your mortal body
[1:49:46] hallelujah
[1:49:48] sin john chapter one
[1:49:52] is now the service beginning amen
[1:50:03] praise the lord
[1:50:09] oh praise the lord
[1:50:11] amen
[1:50:13] what a word what a message this morning
[1:50:15] amen
[1:50:16] praise the lord
[1:50:18] you know i i prayed i hope that the lord
[1:50:19] was able to help me to to translate
[1:50:22] i hope you got what the message was amen
[1:50:25] they are quick and empowered if it comes
[1:50:27] upon you it changed your life
[1:50:29] it's it's a must
[1:50:31] it's a must
[1:50:33] this message has come to make us sons
[1:50:36] and daughters of god anything less than
[1:50:39] that you have not come in contact with
[1:50:41] the message
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:43] you can have all the tips
[1:50:45] you can have all the books anything less
[1:50:49] praise the lord
[1:50:50] that was the reason why brother branham
[1:50:51] said the highlight of his ministry
[1:50:54] was the talking
[1:50:56] and what is the talking is the life
[1:51:00] of the sacrifice coming back
[1:51:03] on the worshiper
[1:51:04] that's the highlight
[1:51:07] because the life of the blood and bulls
[1:51:09] and gods could not come back
[1:51:11] on the worshiper
[1:51:14] but a worshiper once parched
[1:51:17] when he comes in the presence of god and
[1:51:19] meet his maker
[1:51:21] praise the lord
[1:51:23] amen
[1:51:24] you see that's the reason why
[1:51:27] it looks like the way it looks because
[1:51:30] this is a high standard
[1:51:33] is a high standard
[1:51:38] that's the reason why god brought us a
[1:51:40] ministry of the son of man
[1:51:43] the son of man being revealed
[1:51:46] praise the lord
[1:51:49] a man born of an alcoholic
[1:51:52] father
[1:51:54] and a poor mother
[1:51:56] he had no human change
[1:51:59] to escape being the drunkard brother
[1:52:02] branham had no human chance
[1:52:06] to escape
[1:52:08] being a drunkard
[1:52:09] but god presented him and i believe that
[1:52:13] seeing god can keep you young people
[1:52:15] from drugs and from sex from every
[1:52:18] foolishness that sin almighty god can
[1:52:20] keep you
[1:52:23] god kept him
[1:52:24] [Applause]
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:27] praise the lord
[1:52:29] even when he was uh he was tempted by
[1:52:31] his friends the father said you are a
[1:52:33] sexy billy
[1:52:34] and he wanted to drink
[1:52:36] almighty god gave him a discomforting
[1:52:39] experience
[1:52:41] but that will win every time he comes it
[1:52:43] discomfort him
[1:52:44] he didn't know what it was
[1:52:46] and sometimes god has to put you in a
[1:52:48] discomforting position to get your
[1:52:50] attention
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:53] praise the lord you lose sleep at night
[1:52:58] just so he can get your attention
[1:53:01] he had no possible chance
[1:53:04] to escape being a drunkard
[1:53:07] he took that quickening power
[1:53:10] he took that quickening power
[1:53:15] praise the lord amen because almighty
[1:53:18] god
[1:53:20] that said do not smoke do not drink do
[1:53:23] not defy your body it was god that gave
[1:53:27] the commandment
[1:53:28] and it was not in brother branham to
[1:53:30] keep
[1:53:31] the zeal of the law performed
[1:53:34] it was the zeal of the lord that
[1:53:36] performed and that seemed you is here
[1:53:40] today the quickening power is nothing
[1:53:43] but the zeal of the lord to bring the
[1:53:45] promise of god to pass in your life
[1:53:51] praise the lord sir john chapter one
[1:53:54] let's just look there and pick up
[1:53:56] something this morning that's i mean i i
[1:53:58] mean that's it's that's that's just a
[1:54:00] message anything less than that we don't
[1:54:02] have a message
[1:54:03] anything less than the holy ghost
[1:54:06] anything less than the new birth we
[1:54:08] don't have a message
[1:54:10] we are just building a cut for ourself
[1:54:13] [Music]
[1:54:14] we cannot come short of there
[1:54:18] praise the lord
[1:54:20] amen verse
[1:54:22] 11 he came unto his own and his own
[1:54:25] receive him net
[1:54:27] but as many
[1:54:30] as receive him
[1:54:32] praise the lord
[1:54:34] that's that's what we do we receive him
[1:54:36] we give our life to christ
[1:54:38] you are receiving him
[1:54:41] you come to church to receive him
[1:54:43] but you you will never be any better
[1:54:47] by just receiving him
[1:54:49] you will never be any better by just
[1:54:52] receiving the message
[1:54:53] as many as receiving
[1:54:59] to them
[1:55:00] give he power
[1:55:03] what is that power
[1:55:05] it's the quickening power
[1:55:08] to them you you were always a son of god
[1:55:12] but there is something that needed to
[1:55:15] bring the reality to you
[1:55:17] something needed to quicken you
[1:55:20] and say i'm a son of god i can't stay
[1:55:22] down in this place drinking and smoking
[1:55:23] no
[1:55:26] that's the thing that makes you talk to
[1:55:28] fight with your own sinful nature
[1:55:34] when that quickening power comes in it
[1:55:36] makes you to to be frustrated with
[1:55:38] yourself
[1:55:40] thank you lord
[1:55:41] that's what happened to rod robertson
[1:55:44] he had a temper problem
[1:55:48] until he was arguing with his own hearse
[1:55:50] back the house because the horse would
[1:55:52] not move
[1:55:53] he came to himself he said no i can do
[1:55:55] this i'm a son of god god you got to
[1:55:57] take this temple from me if you don't
[1:55:59] take it you come at me my body right
[1:56:00] down here you got to give me the holy
[1:56:02] ghost
[1:56:04] we can't keep packing packing and just
[1:56:07] giving reason well that my family i was
[1:56:09] born like this you can keep packing that
[1:56:11] thing
[1:56:12] you can keep packing it around
[1:56:18] there must come a time where you say
[1:56:20] from that time
[1:56:22] from that time from that day
[1:56:24] never the same
[1:56:30] amen praise the lord
[1:56:33] that's the quickening power to then give
[1:56:36] he power to become sons of god
[1:56:40] some said daughter of god even them that
[1:56:42] believe on his name
[1:56:44] that's that's the reason why his name is
[1:56:45] very important in baptism you cannot
[1:56:48] take a trinity in baptism
[1:56:50] you have to believe on his name because
[1:56:52] the quickening power is attached to that
[1:57:00] praise the lord
[1:57:03] amen
[1:57:08] oh yes i believe that this morning
[1:57:11] as many as believe on his name which
[1:57:14] were born

[1:57:25] pastor my father being the message no no
[1:57:27] no no no this is this birth is not by
[1:57:29] blood
[1:57:31] it's not by the will of the flesh
[1:57:34] that's the reason why we have to bring
[1:57:36] the flesh on a suggestion
[1:57:39] we have to tell the flesh that you you
[1:57:41] are just a transporter you need to obey
[1:57:43] me not me obeying you
[1:57:46] you got to look at yourself in the
[1:57:47] mirror say you listen to me
[1:57:55] [Music]
[1:57:57] sometimes you gotta get serious
[1:58:00] we play too much
[1:58:02] and we make excuses
[1:58:05] we make comfort room for the devil
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:12] which is now born
[1:58:14] not of blood not of the word of the
[1:58:16] flesh
[1:58:18] none of the way of men
[1:58:20] it can't come through a pastor
[1:58:22] it can come true a church association
[1:58:26] it's a birth that comes from above
[1:58:30] it's a birth that comes from above and i
[1:58:32] tell you young people when you
[1:58:34] experience that nobody can can can can
[1:58:37] make you doubt it
[1:58:40] because you will be there when it
[1:58:41] happened
[1:58:42] and you will know when it happened
