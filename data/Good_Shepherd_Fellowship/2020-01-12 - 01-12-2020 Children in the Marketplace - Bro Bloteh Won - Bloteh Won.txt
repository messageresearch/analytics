========================================
[Music] you [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] but last night was a different just go to sleep because I just it's just amazing I just thought came to me that you know we're here in but part of him but I wonder if we like I realized last night that we were in his mind so we were already perfect this this this body is the one that's right now and in the state that is not supposed to be but what's working from the inside it's coming through the outside and so that's what's gonna pre that's to perfection the word that comes in us and we're surrounded and we don't see how we're surrounded but there's more witnesses around us than what we know because I remember what Elijah said he like I said to his servant he said sir there's too many of us there's too many of them you know and he said well Lord open his eyes and when he open his eyes he saw the army the mighty army of the Lord so I just want to thank the Lord being here and giving me the opportunity one more time to lead services and leave the songs to you and bring your hearts up to him who deserves the glory in the praise the worship and our in our love so I got a couple of requests here it's a song request by sister Bridget you have a special do you have a special I can't make it make this one so it's one of the children God's will junior Jeremiah have a special okay so as we begin our services let's start with that beautiful song that I was had in my mind this morning hey I just woke walk up with it so here we go woke up this morning with my mind [Music] Oh I won't [Music] so John's gonna chase [Music] oh yeah Oh [Music] oh please [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] please dad I said leave it that way three of the Lord brain [Music] all the trees myself [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you lord [Music] I guess song requests by sister Bridget come up I want to be critical too dear for my life I study now : the choice to [Music] I [Music] but that's where [Music] well [Music] squeezy [Music] my goodness [Music] you as to death I wonder who [Music] again [Music] by [Music] was reserved [Music] I give this what I see [Music] thank you sister burger thank you very much we appreciate that thank you we have one more that's jr. Jeremiah have a special young fella [Music] here we go praise the Lord Jesus yes to close my eyes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hey I want to give you a little testimony of my life what the Lord has been doing in my life sometimes you know you you run as fast as you can sometimes from the Lord but you know it's like when you go fishing and you you got your fish you know it you just if it's a big fish and you're fighting with it you know you just let it run sometimes the Lord is like that with me in my life he he lets me run he lets me run and then all the sudden he just puts the brakes on me and then next thing you know I'm pulling back you know but he always has a way in my life to bring me back to him I not that I don't believe because I don't think nothing can take that from my heart my belief in him and how great of a savior and how He loves us but these past few weeks I was in the hospital for a couple of days and this was the first time I came up here to to delete songs and as we say lo and behold that same night this burning sensation just came on my chest got up about two o'clock in the morning I don't know if I haven't shared this with you or some of you have heard and it's just the burning sensation it was like somebody just put a iron through my chest I got up and I said what what what is this you know usually usually sometimes when I have an experience like that the first thing that comes out of my mouth is am I going home it's a time to go home you know but this time I did not for some reason I just got up and I said what is it you know and there's no pain no no no indication that did my heart was you know giving me trouble and so I just said well let me take two aspirins and go back to bed and that's what I was planning to do to go back to bed and so but I didn't I took the aspirins in the Bernese and said she went away and I said no let me just go to the hospital sure enough the they brought me and they put me in the station and I was waiting they took some blood sample it came back negative because when you supposed to me when you have a heart failure you have an indication that that there's some enzymes they come out from the heart and I think and I think if I'm if I'm not mistaken it's the only organ in the body that sets out those those same signs so you know that something's going on with your heart and so I I just sat there and I said well the first one came out negative in it I put my jacket on and I said well it you know you're holding me too long here I want to go home and I started kind of looking around I my jacket on get ready to go home and and so I saw one of the nurses I asked and that's hey can you tell the doctor everything is okay right well we want to know you want to run another blood sample on you just to make sure so about 4:30 in the morning 5 o'clock they came and threw some more blood about 5:30 6 o'clock around there the doctor came in she looked at me you know like I'm ready to go home I told it as well you're not going anywhere the only place you're going is to the third floor you know we found that your heart is something - going on there so sure enough you know I said okay well there'd be his will not mind so but you know it's like sometimes when you try to do something for the Lord you know or the Lord calls you to do something for him the enemy is always there to discourage you and do like brother branham said to give you a punch but you know what he's always there to see us through and he told me through this and I was there Thursday night Friday night Saturday morning I said I want to go because I need to be in church on Sunday and so they did what they had to do with the NGO class when they put a dent in my and then the doctor came in and about 11 o'clock in the morning they let me go but you know I want to believe that that was the hand of God who put his he put his hand in my chest because it wasn't I guess it wasn't my time to go home yet and he needed me here and I believe that the last time I had that that that feeling was many years ago when I was out cleaning the cars of when I first got here on a winter cleaning the cars of the brothers and sisters out and my feet were freezing and I said Lord do you know what I'm doing and I was on my feet got hot they're warm frozen right there and then and you know he I think it was him who did that because he knew that something was wrong in my heart all these few weeks I've been asking him to help me with my heart and he did so I just I'm thankful to him and I gave him the glory for what he's done for me you never know how the Lord is gonna do it but he does it and he's faithful so I'm just thankful and grateful to him then I'm still deal with you so you know as we go on to services we want to ask brother Cassy to just say a little word of Prayer for us and and just thank the Lord what he's done for us and what he does for us every day brother Cassie would you lead us in

there was nobody being a witness what happened but we believed there today no one took Moses picture Moses never took a selfie but he testified of faith and we believe it praise the Lord and you just think about it when he saw the fire on the mountain realizing there was nobody around the area and he wore clothes the thing that attracted him the leaves of the tree was not burning and he got closing and he kept looking what and then he heard of wars coming out of the mists of the fire Pauline Rosie's Moses I said there to say the other [Music] as we worship the law this morning like I

in the life of your family or in the life of someone you know and you are just dare and go wash it wrong oh let's sing [Applause] nothing [Music] while the musicians slowly press play you think about it if you were standing in God's presence if you have come in the presence of the intent of one then you are there alone if you had an opportunity for God to be visible to you this morning and you are standing before him what would be that thing so dear to you that you would like to talk to him about what will be their thing so pressing on your heart that you would like to say to me if it is just

and forth washing so let's just talk about a few meanings after the service I like to talk to the sisters on there I hope I'm not forgetting something he can pressure water we've been having now sister below would pass for a good wine now she's she's not a visitor she'll be coming you just need to come one to be a visitor amen unless you want to make yourself a visitor praise the Lord but after the first coming we don't have no special treatment for you so but it's approaching time for her to go back in be with the children and the rest of the family dating and hoping that she will be back soon so we just want to appreciate having our sister with us it's been it's been a blessing to get to know her and I mean some of the wonderful things that the Lord has been doing and I mean in many ways that we have dealt with our sister and you know she's a woman that love the Lord she will not hold back to share how the Lord is dealing with her praise the Lord and and we appreciate that it mean so we want to keep her in prayer and pray as it comes to the time for her to fly back that she will have a safe trip and since the below when you get home greet the children for us and greet her brother well clear for us also passed a weekly praise the Lord and brother Stephen just told me this morning and I'm not sure I don't know whether he's in the dream oh I was talking to her brother I kept thinking about it and but brother Zephaniah periods have gone to be with the Lord over in Thousand Year and we will we will miss our brother he's been off of the mission field for why because of his health condition but he is one of the men that is that is greatly appreciated in their area Tanzania and for the work that he's been doing over the years going into the mountains and trying to bring the gospel to many of those people that were away from civilization and and I mean he worked anything to go up into the mountains and witness to those people if you ever saw any and in presentation a Bible way from Canada or voice of God and you see those people with their spears and the African attire on you know hole in the Bible in their hands but but as a fan eyes were one of the men I was behind their work and not only reaching them he did as much as to put the message in their language so they were working as much as translating in lot of the languages over a thousand year we you know we never got a direct communication so there was there was not a way we cou participating in supporting his home going I know brother Barry Corey works a lot with them I might I might talk to him a little bit to see what is what is going on there but that is what we know for now so we pray that the Lord way was strengthened strengthened you just think about that he was he was so much known in in in Tanzania in the area the last part of his health he started losing his mind and he would just walk out of his house but Bella Williams was telling me there he walk out of his house and he go in the street he don't know where his eye but because people so much know him as a preacher they will hold his hands and bring him back home praise the Lord Amen and he kind of had a factor there his children a little bit in a positive way and in in an emotional way to see their father going through all of them but you see that's what happened when we come to the end of our journey that's the reason why why we have strength and we have our right mind let's do what we can do for the Lord in this way that we can do it praise the Lord Amy and we just pray that the Lord will we come for the family and strengthen him and the church the work therein intention year continuing to go on and this church over the years has been greatly supporting the work there and we have not got back from it here we keep doing the best that we can as an assembly to be able to support what the brothers are doing there so we want to just thank the Lord for all of the earth amen praise the Lord I want to just bring a little message to you kind of a continuation but I've been thinking about this song you are not God you had God alone sister fate if you can happy with their young people I would depend on you to help me to sing this song [Music] now if I if I spoiled something you forgive me demain but I want just I want us to just worship the Lord amen [Music] we stand on our feet and do that [Music] you are not a god created by he won't and you are not a god and any model man you are not a god ah that just no way that's let's take it back again sister faith I got distracted a little bit you are not a God created you are not a guy [Music] you are only down whenever [Music] let's just stop right the a men will do more practice on that in praise the Lord you know when you're singing to yourself you the best singer in the world I want to bring you on stage then you all never see man [Music] I just [Music] Asian word [Music] you [Music] let's say yeah one more time yes [Music] a lot less she let's take our Bibles in Luke chapter seven Thank You musicians st. Luke chapter seven same Luke chapter 7 let's read from verse 31 and the Lord said we're on to densha our liking the men of this generation and to what a delight they're like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have born unto you and ye have not we for John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and yes a he had a devil the Son of man has come eat and drinking and yes a behold a long term man and one Berber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified in our children let's pray together father Lord Jesus we just want to pray and ask the Lord you bless your word now we commit the rest of the service in your hands Jesus name we pray amen praise the Lord Allah bless you you may have you see and I want I want preach on them I'll speak on a little talk that I tied to a children in the marketplace children in the marketplace I believe if Jesus was in our day he would say children at the Mall of America praise the Lord because that's just what he tried to do they tried to Jesus I compress the marketplace into one Hall cover it make it nice praise the Lord and he called him more but in those days it was marketplace amen it's kind of for a little bit attract men when i reading the scripture I know I read it maybe two weeks ago on what we were speaking about but listen to this but Branham says believe doubt this and he said this he said now Lord has children playing in the marketplace as we stand and know that you want us to be happy and rejoice you said that you that your joy might be for for his Lord then he was praying this this when when when he said this there are children in the marketplace as we stand we know that you want us to be happy and rejoice I believe that's what people take their children to the mall for them to be happy go on right and see different things and God want us to be happy it's strange that even our Lord Jesus speaking to that generation he could use this language and say this generation is like children in the marketplace praise the Lord and and when you go in the marketplace they are just there a lot of things children have things there the a attracted to and other people also have things that the a attracted to but if our Lord Jesus who speak to that generation concerning the messenger of their age praise the law now a major thing has happened 400 years Israel never had and here God sent a man on the scene like John recorded in Saint John chapter 1 a man sent from God he comes on the scene from 9 years or he went into the wilderness he spent all his youthful days in the wilderness he never had a toy to play with he facture on his own tallgrass up heard and all the different animals now they have to make them you know when into whatever material they make them rubber for the children to play john saw it real amen when john was playing with lucas he was not making it sound he was hearing the sound praise the Lord when there was a lion around he knew the sound he was not making a sound like the children made you to praise the Lord but he went into the wilderness and at 30 years or he came out of the wilderness with a message repent the kingdom of heaven is a him and he sounded his message right there at the River Jordan he says he got a vision in a wilderness upon whom you see the the Holy Spirit discerning a Sedov that would be the same one you see behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and he introduced the Messiah praise the Lord amen and after Jesus God into his ministry this is what I want us to notice when Jesus was making this statement about children in the marketplace praise the Lord because in a marketplace one of the thing about children also they don't they don't they don't care what it costs if you see it they want it children don't go and look up price stock and sees oh it's expensive they don't do that you see Papa I want it praise the Lord Amen is the older people they look at the products a let's go let's go let's go praise the Lord because no the child would like that thing but I need money let's go let's go down there down there I see something down it praise the Lord children in the marketplace but years a year a major junction of time a major junction of time word we can say there was the beginning of an Exeter we can say it was a adjoint of time where God was going to take his people from Judaism and he was going to bring them into the reality of everything that the laws and the prophets spoke about yeah it was not just creeds and dogmas duels and dumb but the Lord was giving realizing that the Lord and no man could be saved by the law the law was given as an expression of God's desire God was showing honor the law what he want to do and what he will do praise the Lord I don't know it looks like when I don't eat on a weekend my ears reduce so better Jordan had to be squeezing it changing it all the time I don't know so at this time God I like the way that brad bramish ed he says right there on river Jordan he said heaven and earth in breaks amen heaven and earth embrace God was at this time about to bring out to fulfill because he is the one that is fulfilling his law God knew that no man could fulfill the law righteously but yet he gave them the Lord it was just an expression of what was in his mind and what he was going to achieve through the ages there will be one group of people that were playing it out in a type there will be another group of people that will fulfill it praise the Lord amen alloys in his holy temple let it EV keep silence so and at this time the greatest gift the Bible says of all men born of woman there was none like John the Baptist praise the Lord this is the one that God proof there even in the womb we can receive the Holy Ghost amen oh yeah they even in the wall because if he did it to one he can do it to others praise the Lord amen but you see the church word has has has corrupt our mind because it's true the scripture they're worth or whoever it is the prison whoever we all are born in sin shipler in iniquity even John the Baptist was born in sin schifflet in iniquity only our Lord Jesus but yet God visited him in his mother womb praise the Lord oh my if we learn to pray for our babies right from the womb I believe God can stay visiting me man praise the Lord he can visit them he can keep him a man now so at this point of time God is bringing the greatest gift the laws and the prophets were until John but you see just like children when you go to the marketplace sometimes they only look for what interesting and sometime the things that interest them has less volume amen sometimes they have more prize but less valuable are we together I want for you to follow me now Yura say that God bring brought on the earth the greatest gift just like in our time but yet the children amen the face that they were looking at this man standing right on the River Jordan he's preaching this guy he's too right before Hera man he did not even stunner he didn't close his eyes he said that you took your brother's wife amen he got down to the street he met the policeman he said you are a curb you take bribe he blasted that the tax collectors praise the Lord even when a high priest came to his meeting he never had no special seat and said bishop you said down here I mean he take the word of God and he address it to them such a gift that was given to the word the forerunner of the first coming but what were the children looking at what were they looking at what was the thing that concerning his eating and his drinking he don't eat he don't drink locusts that's all they are looking at the petty things even our Lord Jesus when God in His Word to Israel the law that you suddenly seek will come in his temple house are your prophecy the Virgin shall conceive his name would be called Immanuel Mary God the counselor they all look for this and they knew that it was the Messiah because Moses for them the Lord your God will raise up a prophet like unto me they saw they knew that the Messiah would be a man go with Tabernacle in a body but when that gift came what were they looking at what was the thing that was attracting them like children in a marketplace they were looking at the things with no value he eat with publicans he play with seen us but this was the man I was going to take the sin of the world this was the man I was going to reconcile man had back to God it seemed that the same thing that is taking place in our day when God by his word revelation 10-7 promised the risk of a ministry that will that will reveal the hidden mysteries of God all those loose ends that were in the scripture Daniel chapter 12 let's look there a little bit Daniel chapter 2 earth and sometimes I think we come to church and we are like children in the marketplace are we together that's the age that we are living in report values on things I mean things of no value have great price and the things of much value people put no price to it praise the Lord Daniel chapter 12 are we together glory be to God amen now we realize here God was revealing to Daniel throughout this book and God was dealing with him all the things that were concerning the Gentile amen let's read from verse one and at a time and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never since there was a nation even told at same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them shall sleep in the dust of the earth and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting damnation and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stynes for ever and ever but they are all Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and forth and knowledge shall increase now ye receive God is revealing to down here that things concerning the Gentile kid 'm our kid embodies revealing to daniel throughout this book how he would turn to the gentiles and start dealing with the gentiles but yet to Daniel he made it a secret he said Sileo it's a secret because all through the ages the God of heaven and earth was known as the god of the Jews even Jesus said it is in John chapter 4 salvation is of the Jews because there were the people that God started dealing with but yet God comes down to down here and he revealed to Daniel the different Gentile kingdoms through the dreams he gave to Nebuchadnezzar from from from from the Babylonian Kingdom to the Roman Kingdom it was all represented in the image he is revealing all of those things to Adhamiya and how he would deal with the Gentile but he's telling down your seal it till the time of being praise the Lord Amen now see Luke chapter 4 praise the Lord see Luke chapter 4 tells us here when Jesus came from the wilderness him in verse 14 the Bible says and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a frame of him through all the region around about and he taught in your sin against being glorified of all any end and he came to Nazareth where he had he have been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read and there was deliver unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me as I chapter 61 because he have anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and he sent me to heal the brokenhearted preach deliverance to the capture the recovering of the side to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the law and he closed the book and give it a game to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears now God told them here to seal the book Amen we shall see you the the mystery the understanding of these things that I would do it will be sealed so our Lord Jesus came no wonder what the Jews expecting the Messiah will now see that he was the messiah why because it was a seal book Jesus got into the synagogue the minister Han him the book he opened a book that was healed he went to a setting page and he read the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me praise the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it back to the minister a very important significance Jesus testifying to the Ministry of that day that you are holding a book that is close and book that is close how can you understand what is in it he didn't open a book and give it to them he opened it he ready he closed it back and he gave it to them why because God has already instructed down here to see you the bud means to close the book the things is I will see you so all through the years we've been proving at a book that was sealed even though we be reading the pages but it has been guests because God says see it and until the goddess says see it says open it it can never be open that's what Jesus open the book he identified what was happening and he closed it and the Bible says there all OH her eyes were fastened on him it's that's what happening when the book open it eliminate your eyes you say I see it Oh sister was right close the book he sat down all eyes were fasting on him why because he had done something that was never done praise the Lord even though there was the very same book they were reading from but the book was seal prelude revelation 10 7 comes on the same in the date of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mistress of God will be revealed praise the Lord Revelation chapter 5 there was a book in the hand of him that was on the throne it was a book that was see with seven seals and that book that was here with seven seals was opened in Revelation chapter 10 praise the Lord look people this is God's work this is what God is doing this now what man is doing this is what God is doing all through the ages men has been probably they've been reading the scripture they've been probing I mean they I mean they have steadied the scripture my goodness I mean a man I was reading about I was reading where is the guy named me and I says I mean just men give himself you have to also realize it that it was under the main age I mean it was all of the men is so god bless men during that time you will realize that many of the commentators they came right in that age the Philadelphia church age because it was mainly age I mean according to Daniel year wisdom knowledge shall increase so there were men that God give knowledge I mean those guys look I'm a high score fee he writes this coffee Bible and you can get down in that scruffy Bible reading from Genesis chapter one and he's not talking about Elohim he's not talking about Jehovah it's the family name of God even though the mistress well it was not at that time but they were honor and anointing and they had an understanding but yet it was sealed praise the Lord because is the anointing that that does the work all the great writers I mean all the great stricter us writers people where when you read your material you said this man knew his Bible but yet they were element that was seal because it was not the time are we together God brought such a great gift on the earth a man from the witness he walked in and now seen the kingdom of God are you the Messiah he said no are you Elijah he said no why you he identified himself by scripture and the voice of one crying in the wilderness such a gift and what did the children do they put at least significant price amen I would say he's a Bob had a man wearing ships came shouting in people ears I rather go down to the synagogue on Saturday and listening to that John is just so noisy I mean he's rude he speak in the face of the king with our respect I mean he rebuked Hera when his brother's wife on Terra hello wife god so angry in her heart that she had to require his head on the platter such a gift my children in a marketplace they will always put great price on the things they have no significance praise the Lord Amen they'll get some kind of a Bobby there and and and and and and the Bobby that is just like that they put a little battery in it take it home after a long week it's dead you take the fault of the chunky hand this but you pay big price of money for it and that's what the church is we were paid prices for things that have less value and we were now put price to our spiritual life we when I put price and time to reading the Word of God we were not propriety to our prayer life we were not even poor price in time to the things that we believe praise the Lord amen there are things of value that hold us together as believers children in the marketplace praise the Lord are we together amen so leave you in a little bit yeah but there is there is something also about a marketplace you tell a child let's go they get excited Amen oh let's go let's go on it I mean it they get excited to get in the marketplace and you get there it's so crowded noise it I mean noise coming from honestly no and the other people shouting I mean it just so noisy pressure on I mean and if you cannot quickly find something of interest you will start becoming bored the noise will make you bored and that's what make sure has become bored to people because they are looking for entertainment they are looking for a jazz musician somali playing rest of music so they can just dance and amuse themselves it became fine their tears of interest it's not becoming bored this place is just old see how the dress oh my goodness how can these young girls dress like this Josh life is becoming boring to people so the me gap Church they got the taste of the people so they put the disco light praise Lord amen you don't hear what are the musician just comes from smoking weed or now put him on a drum yeah because they want to get the people because churches becoming bored but when a person is spread up with an expectation in their heart every meaning in service is very interesting fresh Lord and also one of the endtime verb emphasis is one of this period of the age baldness I mean being bored people gets bored they pay the rent of their home but yet they are bored in their home their home can give them comfort this house is so boring you pay in the rain why pay the rent just go homeless amen go homeless if you cannot make your house life life for you to stay in and enjoy it don't pay the rent go homeless praise the Lord glory be to God they want the best job they want to make more money but

in the kitchen they give 40 in the bedroom they get 25 and every place get a different channel but yet they are both in their home they are bored it really the reason is because you have missed the thing of interests you have missed the thing that you're supposed to be enjoying and I'll tell you for in it nothing in this life will bring you satisfaction you'll be like children in the marketplace praise the Lord until you take them on this week everything is boring it's just boring pop I let go home just split just boring praise the Lord and you take them on the swing it's this amount of money it just go up your time is out get them praise the Lord and then they want to go back there again praise the Lord you know HR didn't budget for this thing that's just let go and try the other one again I mean it make the things so sweet in a twinkling of an eye I mean a commercial word captured our scripture in a twinkling of an eye get down your time is finished like any to some few things here but BAM say it's your correction creating the book of correction it reading from the book of Corinthians he says need neither be idolaters or you say I thank God I'm not an adulterer we're just a meaning let me let's examine it by the word let's look at it by the word of God say I wouldn't worship an idol that doesn't ought to get a mean you worship an idol you just have to be other doing nothing amen because the people that worship idols what are they doing nothing they just said they're looking at the Sun then doing nothing but the a crease has bound into that place and said just say there and look at a song they are not doing anything that is idolatry doing nothing go to church yeah that's all right go back home do nothing about it but a real born-again man or woman can't stand still always a feeling of a new wine something inside you want more of God you don't want to get more or you want to give it out praise the Lord there is something in them they have got to testify they've got to do something they are bound to do something they can hold their peace oh God look into our hearts asami us by the Holy Spirit and let us see this morning if there is any evil thing in us if there is ticking away father we now lay it at the altar to walk away and leave it there if it's other nests or temple if it is indifference if it is negligence whatever it may be if it is hatred malice and if it is tribe strife whatever they may be Oh God take it from us today praise the Lord let's turn to our Bibles in the book of Peter 2nd Peter chapter 3 praise the Lord are we together the acid second Peter chapter three first Peter chapter three sorry first Peter chapter three verse 18 for Christ also have one suffer for seen the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which he went and preached unto the spirit imprison which sometimes were disobedient now this scripture kind of a revered to us there even Jesus when he was lying in the grave he was not a doe he was busy there is no Adonis in God the Bible shows right from that from the beginning Genesis chapter one in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth chapter two the efforts were far far more far bad and God said let there be the word the first day the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day let us make man in our image and the seventh day there was a change of disposition because Paul in the book of Hebrew he took the rest of the seven day and make us to know it was not going to sleep and just and just sitting there doing nothing but God changed his dispensation now he will embody himself in his son and he rested Parabellum says a power of transformation he says God who do know he will no longer speak but man he will speak through the son because he was resting in the son that is the reason why Adam could give the exact name that God wanted for this animal there suck name he could placed into the exact place because he was an amateur golf the dispensation has changed so there is no other mess in God the structure proven right here he died even in the grave he went down and preached to source impressing verbatim says here in 2 min 1957 he was in other he Wayne when he was he was in the tomb we think he was just lying there dead but he was down stair conquering praise the Lord amen still conquering o praise the Lord amen he went down and he took the keys away from sit on and he got the keys above death in hell tonight and because he life we can live awesome praise the Lord Amen that's what happened that's the spirit of the age that's what we have new entertainment coming up all the time because the mind of man goes so blank and he don't know what to do he gotta play this game he got to play this on a game you gotta I mean he just just working and working and working and working praise the Lord Amen now let me let me let me also turn the page this way and help you to see even these people all our inventors the people that are inventing all the things they are mean that also your mind is not at all they are always thinking what nest can we break one less can have the word and they said I'm all night anything if we give them a microwave I mean they can hit their food eat and grow right out and they are thinking pressure on amen and the thing on all of these different games and things and and and and bring it to do what capture us into you know trying to find an entertainment so we can be bored and when mind can be either we're just doing this and doing that and and and they can receive on the profiting end amen it knows the note that is the spirit of the age press a lot if we don't give the people entertainment in this age we will have we will have a lot of mad people on the street press a lot so you see even even though it's kind of a kind of a blow my mind I just thought that you know never even knew how big big analyze the video game in industry aids not only for kids or you say for kids okay they can be done entertainment for the but when you see the adults that are in it praise the Lord and I mean they are so connected around the world somebody in Japan on a game with this other person and I mean all of that you know and those things don't grow of the earth it's made that thinking they're not sleeping they are thinking I mean the social media what was same so to be on it in and out of there were men that taught that if we create this app it will make the world a global village and people can be sharing and there I mean they have turned to whatever people are making of praise the Lord but do you realize that even science testify we have not gone over 10% of the potential of our brain with all the if all the things that man has invented the actual potential of the human brain or the nuclear bomb and all the things that they have it's just like God saying to Daniel c8 man has the ability just like Adam Wars like this tree leave from here and come on this place but when man felt God's to you it praise the Lord Amen God pay the tide and just give you 10% just use temple sing Amen glory be to God that's the reason why the takes man that God raised to satisfy our special fears and a man that I walk with God to step behind that I get into the realm of the super sense and that's what he's calling us when he said come up higher praise the Lord come up higher that's one of the thing that is killing the age that we live in glory be to God oneness of unity he says but when you are really born honor the wings of the Grace and power you will agree with every word that he said is truth and when God moves in the supernatural your heart with hunger right to it amen he will say god be praised forever you will be fill you can't stay empty empty just feeling empty you just feeling empty but if you are filling yourself with the Word of God if you keep drinking from the fountain of life amen you keep drinking from the fountain of life and you take that little verse in the Bible and you think about it every day then you try to meditate upon it all you need is just to break into a China praise the Lord for my goodness then the word stop becoming like a honey every simple things you see you remember that's the scripture in the Bible that says it then there is that hunger there is something in you that want to find it praise the Lord then bread is shown you you I mean you find yourself looking at scriptures and looking at code and I mean you're just like a preacher you preaching to yourself in the word it's just bubbling in you ish that is suffering from sleep apnea people can't sleep stay on your phone what are you doing because the other nothing creative they are doing I mean they're not they're not building something to help themselves neither to help somebody if your life is not helping yourself or having somebody you have a boring life no matter how much you think you are busy you are one of the most other men on the earth that's what matter with the comfort today as soon as you get converted you still gathering around you ought to be over there on your knees seeking God for the bastion of the Holy Ghost to be filled up then you have got the walls his blessed presence with you and then when the enemy comes in like a he comes in like the lion in the game that night with Daniel the light of God shines out and get around you if the good man of the house amen hasn't got it Ganesh that's what Jesus says and a good man of the house is the Holy Ghost amen if he's not there my goodness I mean the devil's gonna come in and in every way you come true peer pressure he will come true I've hurts on the internet he will come through opps he will come true I mean he just having a lot of China's to come true but you see how does it happen it's when children in the marketplace lose their entrance of why the windy praise the Lord Amen so in another sense Jesus was trying to tell his age and even our age God brought a gift and mone you and the only thing that you can extract a talk at things of no value praise the Lord that's the only thing you can ascribe it to things of no value John came and then you said he was eating honey me and and locusts and the son of man has come you say he's a beast he sees friend with publicans wish me you are not seeing the value of the calf of God price law and that is the same thing in our age people have not seen the value of the gift of God to know that God promised in this age to reveal the mysteries the secret mistress from the foundation of the world to restore our hearts back to the house of the father where men walk once again with coming contact with God praise the Lord we will not just be conforming ourselves to church grease and truck talk much but there will be a change from inside praise the Lord I mean you think about it how does make all of the blots of boots and girls to India age amen Jonah young Danar and his friends shared remission and how did this to India aged inner working with God praise the Lord there was something there was something inside people there was something that was real man I was telling something this morning I got I got I got sidetracked during the week and it was something I was studying it I mean it just it kind of fought it blew my mind I said wow I didn't see this thing amen I didn't see this thing the Bourbon talks about the souls under the altar they're saying how long how long you know what he said I'm studying that we could get to there I'm bringing that to you Oh steady it together he said when God made man in the beginning he made us for this earth praise the Lord like even when we talk about heaven in heaven in heaven sometimes we think we just go in space no heaven we'll be right here on earth now in the Jehovah Witness way because God we have to renovate this earth he will have to burn it to ashes I call into his word and the ranchers would come and inhabit the earth praise the Lord amen and you know what he said that they're kind of a blew my mic himm read it to you I mean I I thought over it I said Oh God forgive me I'm even guilty praise the Lord he said because we are made for that we are made for the earth or even said lastly the meek shall inherit they have always a beautiful scripture my goodness man he said because we are made for the earth those souls under the altar the a constant cry how long was to come back to this earth amen to enjoy food water and good sleep oh my goodness me I told myself I need to start eating man praise the Lord and I was just thinking about it I say young people that you had the grace of God on your side don't abuse this body don't abuse this body if you don't have nothing to do go to sleep sleep is good for your body if you don't have nothing to do go to sleep put the pillow over your head you're laughing what we get into it you will see what I'm talking about the Bible says he gave his beloved sleep and I've been thinking over that scripture and I tried to study it what is in sleep that God gave Genesis chapter 1 now watch this now thus the scripture says he put out on on the earth the only time that God will mention sleep right from the beginning was when he was bringing out the woman praise the Lord he put Adam to deep sleep Genesis chapter 15 when God was confirming the coveting of redemption to Abraham he put Abraham to deep sleep sleep is good for you deep sleep we're not we're not talking about that one let's leave that one yet let's deal with this Adonis amen it's not bad to be children in the marketplace but it's bad when we lose our focus when we lose the interact that the things that are interesting the thing that God is waiting to our eyes in a message spiritual a ministry he says this is just like a little trying I mean he said God has waived God has risk of men that had reigned through the ages with healing ministry God has raised up preachers there were men now what we have in this age preachers that are there to abuse the people but there were men that was so passion for soul to be safe God has wave gifts before our age the owner is where once again what happened in Genesis chapter 18 return back on the scene with God turning his back to the congregation and God will do that in our generation we're listening to those things on tapes do they grab our attention I will impress by 8 and we impress do we pop rise to it or it just something they have become a slogan children in a marketplace the thing that God has put on display for us praise the Lord men has preached through other ages there has never been an age where God has rightly defined the fight for ministry and their work in the body there has never been an age where God has rightly defined the gifts 9 spiritual gifts and their work in the body and God has put those things on display for us until Paul says desire spiritual gifts desire spiritual gift desire to see vision desire it they become a desire young people desire to play music desire to do something for God go have things on display when you go to marketplace that's what happened teens are on display so you can see it I mean the hardness are just taking the mind of the people until we think there are things just for special kind of for people they are all for God's children brother branham said Lord as children playing in a marketplace with thing and know that you want us to be happy God want you to be happy that he's so anxious to give you the Holy Ghost then even you desire to have it he want to take you away from all your stress and worry and bring you to a place where you can trust God and know that this God is real he want you to be happy that's what we take our children to the marketplace for them to be happy buy them some gifts and that's the very same thing that God want to do to you he just don't want you to be a benchwarmer or just don't want you to be just an associate he want you to be a son a daughter they have the right to everything the father have praise the Lord just like I said children don't ask their parents how much money in your bank account brother Branham says God can never be as austere why are we afraid he said acts for big things ask for big things you have not because you ask Matt praise the Lord but you also have to remember this is not a wasteful father he's not a wasteful father he would do you sometimes like the prodigal son he would trust you with something and allow you to go out I see what you would do with him if you waste it he's still willing to forgive you if you can only recognize and come back home but that's what the father does he has gift he has wealth that he want to trust you with that's a young woman I say young man praise the Lord if we only change our vision and start looking at the thing of interest praise the Lord amen can you imagine that a boy goes down to the shopping place for his death until his death I want a computer because I'm thinking about building an app oh my goodness I mean it it kind of fosters something in the father he sees a creative mind I want computer why you want it I don't want to play video games so I give you tablet you already have your tablet no you know there's a new game that is up yeah then then you and the father you have to talk what I'm saying is that the thing that you say to the father there are things you say they will pick up his interests immediately he know that this is a song that is desiring to represent me praise the Lord and there are some things you would say he just know that it's just after you're lost you are just converted I mean you are just being envious or some someone you know well you know whatever it is they seem when we come to the house of the Lord we all come as children sometimes we don't know how the service is going to be where we come on the expectation believing that God will speak to me and sometimes you put something special on your heart but you know my heart no matter what is growing true you know my heart towards you and if you can only speak to me I know you promise you never leave me you never forsake me I know I know you are with me I just want to feel your present real I just want to hear you calling out my name those are the things that interested father he knows that you you are desiring a closer relationship you are desiring something intimate because it is only between you and God musicians you can come let's just bow our heads together you think about it people

people are not dreamers go ahead there with people all of his children he's a loving father that he tried he make himself real to all of his children you I will loosen the area of focus and we
