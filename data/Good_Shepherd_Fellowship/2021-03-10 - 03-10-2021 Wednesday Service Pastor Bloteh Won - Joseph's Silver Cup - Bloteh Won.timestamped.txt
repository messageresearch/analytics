[1:01:42] uh
[1:01:46] how can we say this is is this precious
[1:01:49] element
[1:01:50] that represents redemption we know
[1:01:53] savor is redemption uh
[1:01:56] uh gold speaks of
[1:01:59] of deity bride speaks of judgment
[1:02:03] now so we will see a little redemptive
[1:02:06] work here that is done
[1:02:08] by joseph uh and
[1:02:11] and as you read the story uh
[1:02:15] we know that uh from the moment that
[1:02:17] joseph
[1:02:18] brothers came in town and he came and
[1:02:21] showed himself over to joseph looking
[1:02:23] for food
[1:02:24] he recognized them and
[1:02:27] i mean i mean there's never the time
[1:02:30] that i read this story
[1:02:32] and and tears don't feel immanized
[1:02:34] because i
[1:02:35] i know what it is you know coming from
[1:02:38] out of air's eye you know i know what it
[1:02:41] is
[1:02:41] after being away for the long time and
[1:02:46] but there is something uh uh as you as
[1:02:49] we read along
[1:02:50] there is something that uh
[1:02:54] uh that brought me to this to this
[1:02:58] thought and i will i will share with you
[1:03:00] as we go along
[1:03:02] praise the lord amen
[1:03:06] so as you read the story and read the
[1:03:09] bible you will realize
[1:03:11] that uh
[1:03:16] joseph has held
[1:03:19] simeon back
[1:03:24] because his brothers in telling
[1:03:27] identifying himself and telling their
[1:03:29] history spoke about their father
[1:03:31] and spoke about their younger brother
[1:03:34] and their
[1:03:34] and another brother that he did not say
[1:03:37] anything about
[1:03:38] he just said we are 12 brothers our
[1:03:40] younger brother and our other brother
[1:03:42] which of course that was joseph
[1:03:44] you know the story but as they go along
[1:03:47] and when they mention
[1:03:48] the younger brother joseph prophet on
[1:03:51] that
[1:03:52] you know to tell them that i don't
[1:03:53] believe you i don't believe your story
[1:03:56] until you bring your younger brother
[1:03:59] praise the lord
[1:04:00] now we all know the connection you know
[1:04:03] uh this guy on sunday
[1:04:04] we spoke about richard and so that was
[1:04:08] benjamin
[1:04:09] you know when uh to realize
[1:04:13] that uh joseph and benjamin
[1:04:16] share the same mother and uh and and
[1:04:19] their mother
[1:04:20] you know uh uh died during child birth
[1:04:25] joseph i mean benjamin was now only
[1:04:27] special
[1:04:28] to jacob but benjamin was also special
[1:04:31] to joseph
[1:04:33] okay he was very special to joseph
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:38] so
[1:04:40] seeing seeing his brothers and now
[1:04:42] seeing benjamin
[1:04:44] create unconsciousness you know you read
[1:04:47] you read the bible the scripture says
[1:04:49] you know he's he spoke to his brothers
[1:04:52] in the hebrew tongue
[1:04:53] and everything that his brothers were
[1:04:55] saying he could understand it
[1:04:57] and and and as they were talking he's
[1:04:59] checking there
[1:05:00] and he stepped out and he go and he
[1:05:02] cried oh my goodness
[1:05:04] i can't believe it this is my brother's
[1:05:07] and the bible says he cried
[1:05:08] but he tried to hold himself i imagine
[1:05:12] run down to the sink wash his face and
[1:05:14] everything so that when that
[1:05:15] you know he was doing as much as he can
[1:05:18] to disguise himself
[1:05:20] praise the lord
[1:05:24] so his brothers
[1:05:29] went back and now they have come with
[1:05:31] benjamin after
[1:05:33] you know convincing their father you
[1:05:35] know they have come with benjamin
[1:05:40] and immediately joseph talked to
[1:05:41] benjamin but he's doing everything to
[1:05:44] to you know to keep it as a secret and
[1:05:46] his heart is beating so fast
[1:05:50] the lord so what he would do is the
[1:05:52] other
[1:05:53] now he will put his silver cup
[1:05:57] in benjamin's sack because he want to
[1:06:00] keep
[1:06:00] benjamin amen
[1:06:04] he wants to keep benjamin so they can go
[1:06:06] and bring their father
[1:06:09] uh
[1:06:13] praise the lord
[1:06:16] amen so far am i in line with the with
[1:06:19] the with the story
[1:06:20] amen praise the lord i hope i'm not
[1:06:24] telling my own tales up here
[1:06:27] glory be to god amen
[1:06:41] okay let's drop down a little bit you
[1:06:42] can read the rest of the chapter
[1:06:45] but let's drop down a little bit
[1:06:49] verse four and when they were gone
[1:06:52] out of the city and that
[1:06:55] year five of jesus said unto his they
[1:06:58] will follow up unto his sea will up
[1:07:01] follow after the men and when thou does
[1:07:03] overtake them say unto them wherefore
[1:07:05] they
[1:07:06] have rewarded evil for good
[1:07:10] it's not this in which my lord drinketh
[1:07:15] and whereabout indeed
[1:07:18] he divine it he have done
[1:07:22] evil in so doing ye have done evil in so
[1:07:25] doing sorry
[1:07:27] and and he overtook them and he speak
[1:07:31] unto them they seemed worse
[1:07:37] and they said unto him wherefore
[1:07:40] said my law these words god forbade
[1:07:43] that that seven should do
[1:07:46] a calling to this thing behold the money
[1:07:50] which were found in our sight now joseph
[1:07:53] is uh sending his his seven but this is
[1:07:56] there's a place here i want us to get
[1:07:58] praise the lord
[1:08:02] verse nine okay let's read from verse
[1:08:06] eight that's where we were
[1:08:07] behold the money which we found in our
[1:08:10] psych mouth
[1:08:11] we brought again unto thee out of the
[1:08:14] land of

[1:08:18] should we steal
[1:08:19] out of the uh the lost house saver or
[1:08:24] gold
[1:08:26] with whomsoever
[1:08:29] of thy seven it be found
[1:08:32] both let him die now
[1:08:36] this was the same statement
[1:08:40] that jacob made
[1:08:45] when leban comes running for his image
[1:08:52] now this is our connection now this is
[1:08:54] the place i want to get you now
[1:08:56] this is our connection this is the same
[1:08:59] statement
[1:09:00] that jacob made when lebanon came
[1:09:03] looking for his image praise the lord
[1:09:07] a man looking for his image looking for
[1:09:09] his god you know i was thinking about
[1:09:10] that i said well people would go home
[1:09:12] and says brother one the bible says it
[1:09:14] was his god you know it was an idolate
[1:09:16] i mean whatever you put before god you
[1:09:18] know whatever you treasured above the
[1:09:20] word of god is is your god amen
[1:09:23] so uh i think you are settled on there
[1:09:26] so
[1:09:26] let me not make a seminar out of that
[1:09:28] tonight
[1:09:29] but this is what i want to get i want us
[1:09:32] to to to be able to get he now
[1:09:34] he's because he's so convinced
[1:09:37] just like how jacob was convinced
[1:09:41] amen praise the lord
[1:09:45] he's so convinced and says uh uh uh
[1:09:49] uh how can we do this how can we do this
[1:09:53] just imagine we returned the money that
[1:09:56] we found
[1:09:57] in our sock we brought it back
[1:10:00] it's let's say a cop that we would steal
[1:10:04] praise the lord and he made
[1:10:08] the very same statement you love the
[1:10:10] lord
[1:10:11] i mean the word of god is so sweet
[1:10:14] amen whosoever all
[1:10:18] thy seventy be found both let him die
[1:10:22] and we also will be my lost
[1:10:26] bound man praise the lord

[1:11:20] you a lot of suspense tonight i love to
[1:11:22] do it
[1:11:24] i love to do it
[1:11:29] amen what you see here is that
[1:11:35] out of inspiration now you remember now
[1:11:38] even this is this is even before god
[1:11:41] started dealing
[1:11:42] with with um with moses
[1:11:45] giving him all the ordinance and the
[1:11:47] different significance of
[1:11:49] of the instrument in a tabernacle that
[1:11:52] brings out the representation
[1:11:54] for days even before that time
[1:11:57] joseph in his mind
[1:12:00] to be able to redeem his brother
[1:12:04] in a sense to keep him because he know
[1:12:07] what he's doing
[1:12:08] the brothers don't know what he's doing
[1:12:10] i love that
[1:12:12] almighty god know what he's doing you
[1:12:14] don't know what god is doing

[1:12:30] struck me by night amen
[1:12:32] praise the lord he knew what he was
[1:12:35] doing but the brothers then they had no
[1:12:37] idea he put the money in the bag and he
[1:12:40] got that
[1:12:41] oh oh what what has happened what kind
[1:12:43] of a mischief well
[1:12:45] what god is doing to us in this but
[1:12:50] joseph knew what he was doing
[1:12:53] praise the lord he knew what he was
[1:12:56] doing
[1:12:57] so he put the silver cup there
[1:13:00] and uh and and and and you see he
[1:13:04] he instructed the stiwa when you go
[1:13:06] don't go to the youngest one start from
[1:13:08] the other one
[1:13:09] so when you open the first black you see
[1:13:10] we don't have it you see
[1:13:12] that's we said it open the second i told
[1:13:14] you we don't have it
[1:13:20] praise the lord amen but now watch this
[1:13:24] the scripture said
[1:13:25] and when you go back a little bit when
[1:13:27] they came with benjamin
[1:13:29] and joseph set them on at feast joseph
[1:13:32] instructed his seven
[1:13:34] to set them in order
[1:13:38] praise the lord they came he set them at
[1:13:41] age
[1:13:43] the first born the second born and the
[1:13:44] second and then the last
[1:13:46] joseph i mean benjamin will end up by
[1:13:49] the sign of joseph
[1:13:52] praise the lord and everyone wow
[1:13:55] they're thinking in their mind wow
[1:13:57] something strange
[1:14:00] how come he's setting us by age
[1:14:04] at first they never thought about it but
[1:14:06] i still went alone
[1:14:09] oh robin you're sitting next to this guy
[1:14:12] oh
[1:14:13] oh wow praise the lord
[1:14:17] because joseph knew what he was doing
[1:14:20] but they never had an idea
[1:14:26] praise the lord you believe that god is
[1:14:29] in control tonight
[1:14:31] he believes that you know that god knows
[1:14:33] what he's doing with your life and you
[1:14:35] just don't know what what is going on
[1:14:37] but god is in control
[1:14:39] amen now so uh
[1:14:42] uh they get over there and and and they
[1:14:45] found the
[1:14:46] the cop in in benjamin sack
[1:14:49] i i i mean i could i would just pre
[1:14:52] preach the redemption of ezra tonight
[1:14:54] but there is no time i just want to
[1:14:55] bring you to a place here
[1:14:58] then verse 13 then the reindeer closed
[1:15:04] every one of them and and i mean they
[1:15:06] started rolling on the ground and
[1:15:07] you know being so ashamed of themselves
[1:15:09] but i mean uh
[1:15:11] judah has has spoken already you know
[1:15:14] that the one
[1:15:16] that uh uh either judah or rubin one of
[1:15:20] them
[1:15:20] took the word here and spoken says uh
[1:15:23] with whom
[1:15:24] they are of that seven you found it let
[1:15:26] him die
[1:15:28] now so uh uh
[1:15:31] we know the story i mean the beg the cry
[1:15:35] and he says uh you know what we we we
[1:15:38] can do this if we if we if we ever get
[1:15:40] back
[1:15:41] you know if we ever go and uh
[1:15:44] uh uh tell our father
[1:15:47] you know uh he's just going to drop dead
[1:15:52] you know and he went back and started
[1:15:54] telling all the story
[1:15:55] but this is the beautiful thing god in
[1:15:58] his providence
[1:16:01] you see the the the the
[1:16:04] the inspiration of the almighty god
[1:16:07] in his providence designing like that
[1:16:11] amen because what what is played out
[1:16:15] here
[1:16:16] was prophesying of how god will redeem
[1:16:20] israel
[1:16:24] amen of how god will redeem israel
[1:16:30] praise the lord now but
[1:16:33] because joseph is the one
[1:16:37] that planted the cup
[1:16:41] amen praise the lord
[1:16:44] just like the almighty god put him his
[1:16:47] predestinated seed in you
[1:16:53] there is no condemnation unto them that
[1:16:56] are in christ
[1:16:58] praise the lord i'm trying to do my best
[1:16:59] not to preach tonight
[1:17:02] amen are we together
[1:17:05] because because joseph
[1:17:08] i mean he had a plan in his mind
[1:17:12] so even when when rubin or judah was
[1:17:16] saying the one you find a cop with
[1:17:18] let that one die now with the case
[1:17:22] of jacob and leban none of them knew
[1:17:26] who did it praise the lord
[1:17:30] if if jacob ever had an idea that it was
[1:17:34] his wife that did it he wouldn't have
[1:17:35] said that
[1:17:39] he would have either come in her defense
[1:17:41] and say is this not your daughter
[1:17:44] and even if she takes something from you
[1:17:46] can you let it go
[1:17:48] but he was fully convinced
[1:17:55] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:17:58] you know it teaches
[1:17:59] us the scripture whether we are angry or
[1:18:02] we are happy
[1:18:04] we have to watch our words
[1:18:12] the lord whether we are angry or we are
[1:18:15] happy
[1:18:16] we have to watch the things we say
[1:18:20] to our children to our wives to our
[1:18:22] husbands
[1:18:23] i could go in in and evening and
[1:18:26] we have to watch the things we say
[1:18:29] praise the lord
[1:18:31] but here that word never meant
[1:18:34] nothing to joseph praise the lord
[1:18:38] it never meant anything to joseph
[1:18:42] he could not hold him holding them
[1:18:44] guilty
[1:18:46] to persecute them would be persecuting
[1:18:48] himself
[1:18:52] amen they will be persecuting himself
[1:18:59] glory be to god but that's not where we
[1:19:03] where we want to go tonight
[1:19:06] we'll find another time to talk about it
[1:19:09] but what
[1:19:11] caught my mind and what you know
[1:19:17] is is the importance
[1:19:22] all through the scripture just like how
[1:19:25] joseph used
[1:19:28] a cup as a symbol of redemption
[1:19:33] to be able to keep his brother close
[1:19:37] you washed through the scripture
[1:19:41] the first time was when
[1:19:44] joseph was in prison
[1:19:49] and these two sevens of uh of uh
[1:19:54] pharaoh found themselves in prison
[1:19:59] praise the lord and then we know the
[1:20:02] story there about the dreams and all of
[1:20:04] that and joseph interpreted their dreams
[1:20:08] and the one thou that
[1:20:11] that was that was set free which means
[1:20:14] joseph in praising remember now brother
[1:20:16] branham says it's a type of
[1:20:18] christ on the cross one was
[1:20:21] was condemned and one was set free
[1:20:24] but the one that was set free he was a
[1:20:27] cop bearer
[1:20:33] he was a cop bearer he was
[1:20:36] pharaoh's cup bearer
[1:20:41] there is something about cop and
[1:20:44] redemption
[1:20:49] there is something about cup
[1:20:54] and redemption and we will look
[1:20:57] we want to look into it a little bit
[1:20:58] here
[1:21:02] so we realized here you know
[1:21:05] uh over there the bulk log was was set
[1:21:09] free
[1:21:10] you know and uh uh
[1:21:13] and the baker had to die the the buckler
[1:21:16] he was the
[1:21:17] the cup burial of of of pharaoh
[1:21:21] and uh uh and i i
[1:21:25] as i was looking at this through the
[1:21:28] scripture
[1:21:29] it kind of surprises me very very very
[1:21:33] much
[1:21:34] when nathan came to david after david
[1:21:38] has failed
[1:21:42] with belt sheba when he came to david he
[1:21:45] said to david
[1:21:47] he gave david a story about a poor man
[1:21:50] that lived in a town
[1:21:51] and this man how his little sheep
[1:21:57] he used the very same word that we use
[1:21:59] for the name of richard
[1:22:00] young which is a young female sheep
[1:22:04] and and nettle said
[1:22:09] that's sheep
[1:22:13] drinks from the same cup
[1:22:21] of the poor man now he's bringing the
[1:22:25] story
[1:22:26] to to david praise the lord
[1:22:30] now you have to remember now that this
[1:22:32] is the prophet nathan
[1:22:36] this is the prophet of god
[1:22:40] this is the man that have the word of
[1:22:42] god for david's age
[1:22:46] for david's day praise the lord
[1:22:49] now david is sitting there in the seat
[1:22:52] he's bawling he's sweating nato has come
[1:22:54] to see him
[1:22:55] there is problem in the town there's a
[1:22:57] poor man that is in trouble
[1:22:58] david is anxious we know that he was
[1:23:01] just caught up in his guilt
[1:23:03] his guilt was making him emotional
[1:23:07] his guilt guilt can put people into hurt
[1:23:10] when they're not supposed to be in hurry
[1:23:13] praise the lord
[1:23:17] and and he had the word of the lord in
[1:23:20] and he's talking to
[1:23:21] to david and he says this poor man he
[1:23:24] has a sheep
[1:23:25] and and he sleeps with his sheep the
[1:23:27] ship even drinks from the same cop
[1:23:32] and this man and david says the man that
[1:23:34] have done that
[1:23:36] the man should die
[1:23:41] and nathan said david you are the man
[1:23:46] but you will not die
[1:23:52] praise the lord now for the fact that
[1:23:55] even the prophet nature
[1:23:57] is is is giving david a vision
[1:24:01] i would call it a vision a vision of
[1:24:04] redemption
[1:24:05] the prophet nathan is giving david a
[1:24:07] vision in his mind
[1:24:08] he's he's creating a story for david
[1:24:11] to see the beautiful redemption story
[1:24:15] that would come out of
[1:24:16] david the the chaos that he found
[1:24:19] himself in
[1:24:21] praise the lord the mess that he put
[1:24:25] himself in
[1:24:26] god was going to bring a beautiful
[1:24:28] redemption story
[1:24:30] amen because from david
[1:24:33] and beersheba will come solomon
[1:24:37] who will become a type of christ
[1:24:42] so in that story there was
[1:24:46] a picture of redemption
[1:24:49] and god has always used a cup
[1:24:53] in the picture of redemption
[1:24:59] praise the lord
[1:25:03] israel was in rome jerusalem the war
[1:25:05] their walls was broken down
[1:25:08] the city gates were all tall the temple
[1:25:10] was wrong
[1:25:12] yet it took another cup bearer
[1:25:14] nehemiah's
[1:25:17] that god will burn in his heart
[1:25:20] for the rebuilding of the wall
[1:25:24] to bring redemption
[1:25:36] the next time when you sing fill my cup
[1:25:39] you will sing it in a different way
[1:25:42] praise the lord because god always use
[1:25:46] cop
[1:25:46] for redemption amen
[1:25:50] glory be to god i think i have a few
[1:25:53] minutes here so
[1:25:54] i can go go ahead a little bit here
[1:25:57] amen
[1:26:06] amen
[1:26:22] this is just a prayer meeting as you
[1:26:24] know
[1:26:26] glory be to god amen psalm
[1:26:30] chapter 116 let's look at that
[1:26:34] a little bit tonight i don't know how
[1:26:36] much reading we'll be able to do but
[1:26:38] let's look at psalm chapter 116.
[1:26:51] praise the lord amen
[1:27:16] praise the lord are we together
[1:27:28] verse 9 i walk i will walk before the
[1:27:31] lord
[1:27:32] in the land of the living i believe
[1:27:34] therefore i have spoken
[1:27:37] i was greatly afflicted i said in
[1:27:40] in my head all men are liars
[1:27:44] what shall i render unto the lord for
[1:27:46] all his
[1:27:47] his benefits towards me
[1:27:50] i will take the cup of salvation
[1:27:54] and call upon the name of the lord
[1:27:58] i will pay my vows unto the lord now in
[1:28:00] the presence
[1:28:02] of all his people amen
[1:28:06] having a lot of the scriptures but uh i
[1:28:08] just want to
[1:28:10] kind of create this picture tonight so
[1:28:13] uh
[1:28:14] we can be able to see this uh uh
[1:28:19] what lays in the shadow you know what
[1:28:22] lays in the shadow
[1:28:24] you you even think about jesus coming to
[1:28:26] the well
[1:28:30] and meeting the woman at the well a
[1:28:32] beautiful story in st
[1:28:34] john that we all love and
[1:28:38] he asked the woman for water
[1:28:41] the thing that was surprising is that he
[1:28:43] did not have anything
[1:28:46] he did not had anything for water but he
[1:28:49] wanted
[1:28:50] water to drink now you have to realize
[1:28:54] that
[1:28:55] the the the jewish cop you know
[1:28:59] it could run from a teacup to a board
[1:29:04] amen whatever that was fit
[1:29:07] for them to drink from
[1:29:12] that's why brother daryl wall says you
[1:29:13] better sing fill my truck
[1:29:16] instead of fill my cup
[1:29:21] praise the lord amen
[1:29:25] because whatever you give to god to fail
[1:29:28] he's going to feel it
[1:29:30] but the thing there is that it's not for
[1:29:32] him to feel it and for you to put on
[1:29:34] your shell
[1:29:34] is for you to drink it
[1:29:38] praise the lord amen
[1:29:43] glory be to god
[1:29:46] amen now so we we see here
[1:29:50] that uh jesus comes to the well
[1:29:53] and he don't you don't have a cup he
[1:29:55] don't have a bucket he don't have
[1:29:56] nothing in his hands
[1:29:58] and yet he's asking the woman for water
[1:30:01] for what
[1:30:02] to drink
[1:30:06] why because he was the chief car bearer
[1:30:12] praise the lord amen in john chapter 7
[1:30:16] he was the one that says living water
[1:30:18] will flow out of your belly
[1:30:21] the church will also become a cupbearer
[1:30:27] as you look through the scripture
[1:30:30] praise the lord
[1:30:49] because jesus told the woman he says
[1:30:53] he says i have water that i can give you
[1:30:55] you will drink
[1:30:59] now keep keep the thought in mind now i
[1:31:01] have water i will give you
[1:31:03] that you would drink how do one drink we
[1:31:05] drink from cup
[1:31:07] so if he had water he had a cup
[1:31:13] if he had water to get he definitely had
[1:31:16] cup to save the water
[1:31:25] and when you look through the scripture
[1:31:27] there are different things you will see
[1:31:29] you will see that in zechariah
[1:31:32] 12 2 israel is called the trembling cup
[1:31:38] amen jeremiah god
[1:31:41] spoke about the cup of consolation
[1:31:49] now so we we have we have all of these
[1:31:52] things
[1:31:52] here but what what what i wanted
[1:31:56] what i want us to do is to to keep the
[1:31:59] picture in mind
[1:32:01] praise the lord joseph was the one
[1:32:05] that placed the cup or instructed that
[1:32:08] the cop
[1:32:08] will be placed in benjamin's side
[1:32:12] praise the lord because
[1:32:16] that was that was the thing that
[1:32:19] made joseph to reveal himself to his
[1:32:22] brothers
[1:32:25] that was the story after they found the
[1:32:29] cop
[1:32:30] and judah started crying on the ground
[1:32:32] and he started rolling tearing their
[1:32:34] clothes and all of that oh my goodness
[1:32:36] we we can't leave our brother yeah our
[1:32:38] father would surely die
[1:32:40] i mean i mean joseph heart is breaking
[1:32:47] praise the lord
[1:32:50] and when they are narrating all of this
[1:32:52] story as you read the bible said
[1:32:54] he stepped back
[1:32:58] he wept his eyes trying to compose
[1:33:00] himself but this
[1:33:01] is the thing that would bring redemption
[1:33:03] to jacob in his household
[1:33:06] it's the silver cup
[1:33:12] praise the lord the savior cup will
[1:33:16] bring
[1:33:16] redemption to jacob and his household
[1:33:20] because when joseph revealed himself to
[1:33:23] his brother
[1:33:24] he cried with a loud crowd he took his
[1:33:27] uh uh uh uh egyptian hairpiece from his
[1:33:31] head
[1:33:32] took all his egyptian makeup and say i'm
[1:33:35] your
[1:33:36] brother
[1:33:40] i'm i'm joseph your brother and the
[1:33:43] bible says
[1:33:44] they started coming close is that real
[1:33:47] is that you let's touch your hands and
[1:33:50] that's the very same thing the church
[1:33:51] going to do
[1:33:58] but the silver cup will be the thing
[1:34:01] that will redeem
[1:34:03] joseph i mean jacob in his household
[1:34:06] because after joseph revealed himself he
[1:34:09] says
[1:34:10] go and call your father no
[1:34:13] secret now amen
[1:34:16] no secret
[1:34:20] praise the lord
[1:34:26] oh my are we together
[1:34:30] praise the lord jesus
[1:34:34] matthew chapter 10 he says
[1:34:37] even a cup of water
[1:34:42] will not go without being rewarded
[1:34:50] even a cup of water
[1:34:53] and brother brandon comes and helps us
[1:34:55] to understand
[1:34:57] that those are the ones that will come
[1:35:01] into god's redemption or salvation plan
[1:35:06] by being kind to god's people
[1:35:15] the people that comes on a cup of water
[1:35:18] are those that were nice to god's people
[1:35:25] so you see that cup it's it's
[1:35:27] [Laughter]
[1:35:29] it's more than praise the lord
[1:35:35] oh my praise the lord
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:44] you love the lord tonight
[1:35:48] glory be to god
[1:35:52] there sharza talked over his father
[1:35:54] throne when his father nebuchadnezzar
[1:35:56] died and he ruled
[1:35:59] the kingdom but just at the time
[1:36:04] that god would tear the kingdom apart
[1:36:10] was when he took the cup that they took
[1:36:13] from the temple
[1:36:16] when he took the vessels of the temple
[1:36:21] to drink his babylonian wine in it
[1:36:26] just like men using the vessels of god
[1:36:30] to drink all their wally
[1:36:34] wine alcohol drugs
[1:36:37] and all of the things that they are
[1:36:38] getting drunken on
[1:36:42] using this body that god has made
[1:36:50] but that cup became a cup of judgment
[1:36:54] because right there an unknown language
[1:36:57] came
[1:36:58] and it was that night
[1:37:02] it was that very night as daniel was
[1:37:06] interpreting the handwriting on the wall
[1:37:12] the meeting the persians was entering
[1:37:14] the city
[1:37:26] praise the lord
[1:37:32] jesus said even a cup of water
[1:37:36] even a cup of water it is not
[1:37:40] the cup as the natural cup
[1:37:44] is the heart that it comes from
[1:37:50] is the heart that it comes from
[1:38:00] because that is the cup
[1:38:03] that god filled with his presence
[1:38:09] is the heart that it comes from
[1:38:15] a lot of people gave cups and wonderful
[1:38:18] glasses
[1:38:19] and then i mean pressure things they put
[1:38:22] water in
[1:38:23] but their heart is not good their heart
[1:38:25] is not right
[1:38:27] they are either they are either using
[1:38:29] their best glass to show
[1:38:30] how much money they buy and want to be
[1:38:32] proud about
[1:38:33] you know what they have they want to
[1:38:35] show off
[1:38:38] he might go down to a village and a
[1:38:40] woman might take an old rustic cup
[1:38:43] but with a good heart
[1:38:48] praise lord i'll tell you a story
[1:38:52] very personal uh

[1:39:47] the guy
[1:39:48] you know i was you know trying they took
[1:39:50] everything i had the money

[1:40:03] i i mean i was i was yelling i was
[1:40:05] crying for help
[1:40:06] crying for my life and
[1:40:10] and and the first man that ran to the
[1:40:12] place when he saw me he was so afraid
[1:40:14] because i mean i was soaked
[1:40:16] in my own block i mean i was soaked from
[1:40:18] head to toe
[1:40:19] when he saw me he was so afraid he was
[1:40:21] nervous
[1:40:22] you know and he just back up so i mean i
[1:40:26] was i was just
[1:40:27] struggling to walk and and this and this
[1:40:29] military woman came in
[1:40:31] and and she saw me she she said what's
[1:40:33] what what's happening what what
[1:40:35] what's what you know she and all i could
[1:40:37] say is
[1:40:38] give me water you know that's all i just
[1:40:41] asked
[1:40:42] i said give me water because i was so
[1:40:44] thirsty
[1:40:46] whether it was because of the bleed or
[1:40:48] whatever i just
[1:40:50] gave me water you know i was struggling
[1:40:51] over my birthing
[1:40:53] and uh
[1:40:56] back home you know at the corner of the
[1:40:59] house
[1:40:59] and we you we do have them here
[1:41:02] is is the drum outside where you keep
[1:41:05] water for your flowers
[1:41:06] but back home people use that and we use
[1:41:09] those waters for different things in
[1:41:11] their home
[1:41:12] so they had a big drum outside as we
[1:41:15] walked to her place she was
[1:41:17] trying to get story from me she wanted
[1:41:18] to know what was what was going on
[1:41:20] but all i could say was give me water
[1:41:23] you know
[1:41:24] give me water and then as we got there
[1:41:28] she just took the cup i mean it was a it
[1:41:30] was a buttercane
[1:41:32] you know i mean what a rusty or whatever
[1:41:34] it is she just dipped that thing in the
[1:41:36] water i can stay
[1:41:37] i can still remember i took that cup to
[1:41:39] my mouth
[1:41:42] i never believed i could drink like that
[1:41:45] i mean uh uh uh this will be almost like
[1:41:48] uh
[1:41:49] uh maybe uh uh one liter or two liter
[1:41:53] i just took it to my mouth and and and i
[1:41:56] mean i just drank the whole thing down
[1:41:58] i drank it down and just poured the rest
[1:42:01] on my face
[1:42:05] praise the lord it was not a nice cup
[1:42:08] but it came from a good heart
[1:42:13] it came from a good hat because you know
[1:42:16] the rest of the story
[1:42:17] she took me over to where i could be
[1:42:19] treated and
[1:42:20] and everything and uh
[1:42:23] you know took some information from me
[1:42:26] but i mean that's that's that's what it
[1:42:28] is you know uh
[1:42:29] so jesus said that you know a cup of
[1:42:31] water
[1:42:32] will never go unrewarded
[1:42:35] but then you remember also
[1:42:39] the last hour of jesus life
[1:42:45] he said father
[1:42:49] let this cup
[1:42:53] let this cup pass but not my will
[1:42:59] but your will be done
[1:43:03] there was a cop he was going to drink
[1:43:05] from
[1:43:08] you know oh i could go on and preach
[1:43:11] tonight
[1:43:12] i could go on and preach tonight but my
[1:43:16] time is
[1:43:16] is almost there
[1:43:22] he says let this cup pass
[1:43:29] and we know what that cup was
[1:43:33] praise the lord he was going to drink
[1:43:39] of all of our farts
[1:43:45] all of our thoughts was going to be
[1:43:47] pulled on him
[1:43:51] praise the lord
[1:43:54] he said not my will but let your will be
[1:44:04] done
[1:44:06] he drunk of it
[1:44:14] praise the lord musicians you can come
[1:44:18] tonight
[1:44:21] maybe the law will help us we'll we'll
[1:44:23] find a time and better talk about this
[1:44:25] but i know i've given you a lot of
[1:44:27] things to think about tonight
[1:44:30] amen giving a lot of things to think
[1:44:33] about and go home and read and
[1:44:35] read through your scripture then
[1:44:40] and going steady
[1:44:49] but you see let me say this
[1:44:53] before we get into singing and get back
[1:44:56] into
[1:44:57] praying to close up here
[1:45:00] one time
[1:45:04] the mother of james
[1:45:07] and his brother came to jesus
[1:45:13] and she said master i want to request
[1:45:15] something of you
[1:45:19] can you allow my two boys
[1:45:22] i want you to sit on your right hand and
[1:45:25] once you sit on your left hand
[1:45:29] will you come in your kingdom
[1:45:39] jesus said
[1:45:46] he said a woman
[1:45:51] it is not for me to give brother brandon
[1:45:54] the message how can i overcome he said
[1:45:56] because that was a predestinated
[1:45:58] position
[1:45:59] he said it was a position that was
[1:46:01] already predestinated
[1:46:03] and predestinated for wu for the bride
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:09] it was a predestinated position
[1:46:13] but he said this is acts
[1:46:16] will they be able to drink from the same
[1:46:19] cup
[1:46:23] will they be able to drink
[1:46:27] because the people that are
[1:46:30] predestinated for this place
[1:46:35] will be able to drink
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:39] in every age they will get a taste
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:45] of that cup
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:52] that's the reason why in every age
[1:46:55] god's people goes through trials
[1:46:59] god's people go through cruel rock
[1:47:02] testing that's why brother branham call
[1:47:04] it
[1:47:04] cruel testing
[1:47:10] another one that we create for ourself
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:18] but the ones that we find ourselves in
[1:47:21] him and we can't tell why
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:26] but it's a pleasure to the father
[1:47:30] because he has counted you walking to
[1:47:33] drink from the same cup
[1:47:39] well brother jordan i feel like
[1:47:40] preaching them
[1:47:42] that the preaching anointing is coming
[1:47:44] to me

[1:48:27] age
