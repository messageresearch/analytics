[0:00] [Music]
[1:09] to meet our enemy, your enemy out here
[1:13] on the field of battle with the word to
[1:15] drive him away from the midst of your
[1:17] people.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; That they might see tonight, Lord, the
[1:21] gospel light. I pray that you'll anoint
[1:23] our eyes with the Isab.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. that it might be open to the truth
[1:28] that we might leave here saying within
[1:30] our hearts, "Did not our hearts burn
[1:32] within us as he spoke to us along the
[1:35] road?
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Heal the sick and the afflicted.
[1:38] Encourage the discouraged. Lift up the
[1:40] feeble hands that once hung down. May we
[1:42] look to the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:45] which we believe is at hand." We ask
[1:47] this in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Seated.
[1:59] I will try to be briefly tonight because
[2:01] I know many has come from different uh
[2:04] sections of the country to for the
[2:06] service or stayed over some of you and
[2:08] have to go back or maybe a way to get
[2:12] back. I thank you this morning. I want
[2:15] to hear brother Neville myself and I
[2:17] heard him many times and never heard him
[2:19] anytime but what I appreciate him. But
[2:21] this morning, that timely message, I
[2:23] know I had the leading of the Lord to
[2:25] listen to that this morning. Very fine.
[2:27] And I see why you people like to come
[2:30] and listen to him also. And he'll always
[2:33] do you good, I'm sure, to listen to him.
[2:35] I was trying to catch up on some of my
[2:37] interviews today, this morning, and this
[2:39] afternoon. I still have many, many, many
[2:41] to go. And uh, as I believe it's Jethro
[2:45] told Moses one time said, "It's just too
[2:47] much for you." So, we've got plenty of
[2:50] brothers here on your problems and every
[2:52] one of them has been legitimate and they
[2:55] are fine things that has to be taken
[2:58] care of. And I would recommend our
[3:00] pastor or brother man and other
[3:02] ministers of our faith here. You can go
[3:06] to them. They tell you just exactly the
[3:08] thing to do. Some people their children
[3:10] intermaring or things that's wrong.
[3:13] these men could help you just the same
[3:14] as as anyone else because they're
[3:16] servants of Christ. And go to them and
[3:19] I'm sure they will they will give you
[3:21] the help that you need. I can't get to
[3:23] all of them. There just so many
[3:24] everywhere you go. They just keep
[3:25] accumulating higher and higher. You see,
[3:27] and you want to get to every one of
[3:28] them, but you can't do it. But I'm
[3:30] constantly praying that God in somehow
[3:33] will work it out all right for you. Now,
[3:38] uh, tonight we want to go to the
[3:40] scripture and read a portion of the
[3:42] scripture out of Genesis the 3 chapter
[3:46] and just refer back a little bit to some
[3:48] things that we've been talking about in
[3:50] times past and um, see if the Lord Jesus
[3:53] will give us a little uh, bit more to
[3:57] what we will know when we go out. I pray
[4:00] pray that he will.
[4:03] Now the serpent was more substal than
[4:06] any beast of the field which the Lord
[4:08] God had made. And he said unto the
[4:10] woman, "Yay, God has said, Ye shall not
[4:14] eat of every tree of the garden." And
[4:18] the woman said unto the serpent, "We may
[4:20] eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[4:23] garden, but of the fruit of the tree
[4:26] which is in the midst of the garden."
[4:29] God has said, "Ye shall not eat of it,
[4:31] neither shall ye touch it, lest you
[4:34] die." And the serpent said unto the
[4:37] woman, "Ye shall not surely die. For God
[4:41] does know that in the day that you eat
[4:44] thereof, then your eyes shall be open,
[4:47] and ye shall be as God's, knowing good
[4:50] and evil." And when the woman saw that
[4:53] the tree was good for food, and that it
[4:57] was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to
[5:01] be desired to make one wise, she took of
[5:05] the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave
[5:08] also unto her husband with her, and he
[5:11] did eat. And the eyes of them both were
[5:14] open, and they knew that they were
[5:16] naked. and they sewed fig leaves
[5:19] together and made themselves aprons. May
[5:22] the Lord add the his blessings to the
[5:24] reading of his word. Now, I would like
[5:28] to take a text tonight out of that and
[5:30] call Satan's Eden.
[5:34] Very crude little thing to say of
[5:37] Satan's Eden. It kind of matches in the
[5:40] other Sunday night, I believe, when I
[5:41] was speaking to you here about a
[5:43] thinking man's filter and a holy man's
[5:47] taste. And sometimes these little crude
[5:50] expressions brings us to something. It
[5:52] gets us to study and put you to reading
[5:54] the word. And that's what I want all my
[5:57] congregation to do. Man shall not live
[5:59] by bread alone, but by every word that
[6:02] proceedth out of the mouth of God. So
[6:04] read the word, study it and study it
[6:06] with the eyes uh of God to give your
[6:11] intellectuals understanding of how that
[6:14] we should live in this present day.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Now to come down tonight just to speak
[6:18] to you to say, "Well, I could do this or
[6:21] that." I'd like to speak with the people
[6:23] as much as I'd like to even go home with
[6:26] each one of you tonight. Uh God knows
[6:28] that's truth. I'd like to go home with
[6:30] each one of you and and eat eat
[6:32] breakfast with you in the morning and
[6:34] and and go out and squirrel hunt with
[6:36] you tomorrow afternoon. See, I I'd like
[6:38] to do that, but I I can't do that. And I
[6:42] would like to go home and just sit down
[6:43] and talk with you, sit on a porch at the
[6:45] service and speak with you a while, talk
[6:47] to you about your welfare and about God.
[6:49] I would love to do that. Men and women
[6:51] in here, God knows I'd like to do that,
[6:54] but I can't do it. is just such a pull
[6:57] and a string and and in this nervous age
[7:00] that we're living in. And I'm a nervous
[7:03] person myself. Today I got my mind made
[7:05] up to something. I've just got to do it
[7:07] and tomorrow it's a million miles from
[7:08] me. Something's done cut in and done
[7:10] this and that. And you have a time
[7:12] trying to keep your wits together. But
[7:14] my main achievement is to preach the
[7:16] gospel
[7:18] &gt;&gt; to the church and do all that I can to
[7:20] bring honor to Jesus Christ in this day
[7:23] while I'm here on earth. and what time I
[7:25] have left on earth. I come to to try to
[7:29] say something to you that would help
[7:30] you. Something I studied after I went
[7:33] home this morning. What could I say
[7:35] tonight, Lord, that would help those
[7:37] people? Listen to that mighty message
[7:39] this morning on brother Neville brought
[7:42] us about I thought it was so wonderful
[7:45] how he said there, a doctor will
[7:47] diagnose a case, but the man that comes
[7:49] with a handful of needles, he gives the
[7:51] injection. So, I thought that was really
[7:53] a a real cute little expression. I
[7:55] thought about that. The serum after the
[7:57] case is diagnosed. And so, that's a very
[8:00] good thing. Uh, I want to speak to you
[8:03] something or bring something to
[8:04] enlighten to you the promise of God for
[8:07] this age. See, something not something
[8:10] that somebody else was in some other
[8:12] day, but something them things are all
[8:14] right. We all refer to those things. But
[8:16] I thought I would try to bring something
[8:19] to your mind with these scriptures I got
[8:20] written here that would enlighten you to
[8:24] know make you a better soldier in the
[8:26] field that you're fighting in now to
[8:29] learn the tactics of the enemy so that
[8:32] you can block everything before he gets
[8:34] to you. See, that's the main thing is to
[8:36] learn to keep the the punches off of you
[8:40] as much as you can. Now, let us look now
[8:43] to this great for a few minutes, this
[8:45] great sinful day that we're now living
[8:48] in. I don't believe there ever was a day
[8:50] that I've ever read in history. There's
[8:52] been greater days of persecution when
[8:54] the children of God was put to death on
[8:56] ever hand. But to see the deceitfulness
[8:59] of the enemy, we've never had a day like
[9:01] this we're now living.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; It's the most cunning, deceitful day.
[9:07] And when I see that, it brings this that
[9:10] the Christian has to be more on his toe
[9:13] today than he ever was in any age.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Now, back in the days of the persecution
[9:19] of Rome to the church, a Christian make
[9:21] a mistake. He went into the arena and
[9:25] was fed to the lions or something like
[9:27] that when they found him being a
[9:28] Christian for his testimony. But his
[9:31] soul was saved because he was a purely
[9:34] unadulterated
[9:36] believer in God and gladly sealed his
[9:39] testimony with his blood as a veins let
[9:42] loose holes in his body and a blood
[9:44] bleed out. He scream up the real loyal
[9:47] faith and say receive my spirit Lord
[9:50] Jesus.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; But now the cunningness of the devil now
[9:53] makes the people believe that they are a
[9:55] Christian when they're not.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; There's the thing you don't have to
[9:59] seal. It's it's a more cunning day than
[10:01] it would be the one you had to seal your
[10:03] your life away with your testimony. The
[10:06] devil has set every cunning trap that he
[10:09] can to He's a deceiver. And Jesus told
[10:12] us in Matthew 24 how this day would be
[10:15] that we're living in the most deceitful
[10:17] day that ever lived. So close that would
[10:19] deceive the very elected of God if it
[10:22] were possible for him to deceive. Now,
[10:24] let's compare some scriptures or
[10:26] prophecies spoken of in the Bible for
[10:29] today and compare it with the day that
[10:31] we're now living in. In second Timothy
[10:35] um 3, we learn this that the prophet
[10:39] said that it would come to pass in these
[10:41] days that man would be heady,
[10:43] high-minded,
[10:45] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[10:47] God. Compare that now just for a moment.
[10:50] We won't we'll just brief it because we
[10:52] haven't that much time to go through it
[10:55] all uh like we should duly take it but
[10:58] just to highlight it so that you can see
[11:00] when you get home and study it. Heading,
[11:03] high-minded, lovers of pleasure more
[11:06] than lovers of God, truce breakers,
[11:08] false accusers, incontinent and
[11:11] despisers of those that are good. Now
[11:14] the spirit spoke expressingly that these
[11:18] things would be in the latter days.
[11:20] That's these days. The prophecy is
[11:22] speaking to it. Now we read also in
[11:25] Revelations 14 uh Revelations 3:14
[11:28] rather the lady of see church age that
[11:31] how the church would be in this last age
[11:34] and it would be it says it was set as a
[11:36] widow and had need of nothing. it. It
[11:38] was rich and increased in goods. And
[11:41] know it not that they were poor,
[11:45] miserable, wretched, blind, and naked,
[11:48] and didn't know it.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; That now remember, he's speaking to the
[11:53] church
[11:55] &gt;&gt; of this age, wretched, blind, naked, and
[12:00] don't know it. That last phrase, that
[12:03] last word is what makes it so striking.
[12:06] They think that they are well filled
[12:11] with the spirit. They're already the
[12:13] lady of sin church age is the
[12:16] Pentecostal church age
[12:18] &gt;&gt; because it's the last church age. Luther
[12:20] had his message. Wesley had his message
[12:22] and Pentecost had their message. Also,
[12:25] it said that because you are lukewarm,
[12:28] neither hot or cold, the emotions of the
[12:32] outside, the mental conception of the
[12:34] gospel,
[12:36] and because he said, "You're that way,
[12:38] I'll spew you out of my mouth."
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, it made him sick uh to
[12:43] see the church in that condition. And
[12:46] remember, they spewed him out and he was
[12:49] on the outside of the church trying to
[12:51] get back on the inside. in that awful
[12:54] lady of Canting.
[12:57] The god of this world today, the worship
[13:01] person of this world today is Satan.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; And the people are ignorant of
[13:07] worshiping Satan.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; But it's Satan impersonating himself as
[13:12] the church.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; As the church. They worship Satan
[13:18] thinking that they are worshiping God
[13:20] through the church. My Lord.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; But it's the way Satan has done it. Oh,
[13:25] you say, "But wait a minute. We preached
[13:26] the word." Look back here at my text
[13:28] tonight.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; For Satan was the one preached the word
[13:31] to Eve first. God has said,
[13:33] &gt;&gt; see,
[13:34] &gt;&gt; it's that miscon
[13:37] &gt;&gt; that applies to the day. He let you know
[13:40] all Jesus did was perfectly well. He let
[13:43] you know all that Moses did was
[13:44] perfectly well. But when you take the
[13:46] promises that they gave for this day,
[13:49] then that was applied to another age.
[13:52] That's just all he has to do. See, is to
[13:54] get the people to believe it that way.
[13:56] And that's that's all. For you cannot
[13:58] take one word away from it or add one
[14:01] word to it. But that's what he does.
[14:04] People ignorantly worshiping Satan
[14:07] thinking they are worshiping God. My
[14:10] Lord,
[14:12] &gt;&gt; as we're warned by prophecy in 2
[14:14] Thessalonians that let's just read that
[14:17] 2 Thessalonians the 2 chapter. Let's
[14:19] just get it a moment if I can right
[14:21] away. I'd like to read that just I
[14:23] believe second Thessalonians I got the
[14:25] scripture here and say now we beseech
[14:28] you brethren by the coming of the Lord
[14:30] Jesus and by the gathering together unto
[14:33] him. I see the coming of the Lord and
[14:36] the gathering to him as God will gather
[14:40] his people to him in the last days.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; The gathering of the people to the Lord,
[14:47] not to the church, to the law.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Gathering together unto him that you be
[14:52] not soon shaken in your mind or troubled
[14:55] troubled neither by spirit or word of
[14:58] letter as from us as the day of the Lord
[15:00] is at hand. Let no man deceive you by
[15:04] any means.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; For that day shall not come except there
[15:08] come a falling away first. And that man
[15:11] of sin. Man of sin. Watch what he is
[15:14] now. A man of sin be revealed the son of
[15:19] predition. That was Judas.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; See who opposes and exalts himself above
[15:24] all that is called God or that is
[15:27] worshiped. know that he as God siteth in
[15:31] the temple of God showing himself that
[15:33] he is God.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; That deceitfulness of the church of the
[15:38] day. See the son of predition, the
[15:41] devil.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; The son of predition, the devil. Then
[15:46] people worshiping Satan in this day
[15:50] thinking they're worshiping God. But
[15:52] they're worshiping him through a creed
[15:54] of man-made denominations and creeds
[15:57] that's brought the people right down to
[15:58] the greatest deception that the world
[16:00] has ever known of.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; No matter how much the word of God of
[16:04] promise for this day is preached and
[16:07] vindicated, they still won't believe it.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; They won't believe it. Then why? We
[16:16] wonder why why doesn't it why won't they
[16:18] believe it when God said he'd do a
[16:20] certain thing and he doesn't?
[16:22] And still they turned their back from it
[16:24] and turned away from it just as Eve knew
[16:28] that what God said God would do. But she
[16:31] turned her back on it to listen to what
[16:33] he had to say. Just remember in other
[16:36] ages it's always been the same thing. In
[16:39] every age it's always been that Satan
[16:42] tries to pervert that word to them
[16:46] making them see some other age. Look,
[16:48] when Jesus come, see, Satan was in that
[16:50] bunch of Jewish teachers and rabbis and
[16:52] priests trying to tell them to keep the
[16:54] law of Moses when their very word said
[16:56] that in that day the son of man would be
[16:58] revealed. See, that he would reveal
[17:01] himself. So, they was trying as long as
[17:03] they kept him religious and on the law
[17:04] of Moses, see what he did? He was trying
[17:07] to tell them that part of the word is
[17:09] just exactly right, but this man isn't
[17:11] that person.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; See how deceiving he is? That's that
[17:15] real day of deception.
[17:17] It's been and now is Satan establishing
[17:22] his kingdom in the earth. That's exactly
[17:25] why he's doing it. For he wants to
[17:28] establish his own kingdom
[17:32] &gt;&gt; as a businessman that's not a Christian.
[17:34] He'll work every scheme he can to make
[17:37] you see something the wrong way. If he's
[17:40] got a a purpose and a personal gain in
[17:43] making you doing that, making you see it
[17:45] that way, he'll show you everything he
[17:47] can and keep you off from the truth of
[17:49] it.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Because he's got a feeling only for
[17:53] himself. No matter how much he lies and
[17:55] cheats and whatever more, he's got
[17:57] personal gain. And that's why Satan's
[17:59] done this. And he's worked through the
[18:02] ministry to do it.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; As God promised he would do.
[18:08] Now, he began by a religious deceit in
[18:11] Eden and has continued ever since. Not
[18:15] by setting up a bunch of communist.
[18:18] Communist has nothing to do with this.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; It's the church that's where you have to
[18:23] watch.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; See, it's not the It's not the communist
[18:27] that would deceive the very elected.
[18:29] It's the church that'll deceive the very
[18:31] elected.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; See, it isn't communist. We know they
[18:34] deny God. They're an antichrist. Sure,
[18:36] they are in principle, but they are not
[18:38] the antichrist.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; The antichrist is religious,
[18:42] &gt;&gt; very religious,
[18:44] &gt;&gt; and can quote the scripture and make it
[18:46] look so plain as Satan did back there in
[18:49] the beginning. He quoted everything
[18:51] right now. God has said, "Thou shalt not
[18:53] eat every tree of the garden." See,
[18:56] quote her. She said, "Yes, we may eat of
[18:59] all the trees of the garden, but there
[19:00] is a tree in the midst of the garden
[19:03] that God said not to eat, for not even
[19:05] touch it, cause the day we did, that day
[19:07] we die." He said, "Oh, surely you'll not
[19:09] die." But let me give you the reason why
[19:11] God said this is because, see, he now
[19:14] what he quoted this truth. You see, he
[19:16] said, "It'll open your eyes and it'll
[19:19] make you know good and wrong. You'll be
[19:21] like God then if you can do it." That's
[19:23] just what he wants to do. And that's
[19:24] just the same thing he's trying to do
[19:26] today. Amen. Yeah.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; It's been a religious deceit since the
[19:29] very beginning of Eden and has been ever
[19:30] since. In Adam's time, it was a deceit.
[19:34] In Noah's time, it was a deceit. In
[19:37] Jesus' time was the same and now is the
[19:40] same. The same way of religious
[19:43] deceitfulness.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Now, we will notice the earth when God
[19:48] had it under control. Now when God had
[19:51] it had it under his control then when
[19:53] Satan took over by uh rejecting the word
[19:57] of God, God one time had the earth under
[20:00] his control.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; He set it in this orbit. He put it make
[20:04] it work. He done everything. Had it in
[20:06] his control. Now we'll compare that with
[20:09] after Satan took it in his control. Now
[20:11] it took God 6,000 years. It didn't take
[20:15] him that long, but he took that long.
