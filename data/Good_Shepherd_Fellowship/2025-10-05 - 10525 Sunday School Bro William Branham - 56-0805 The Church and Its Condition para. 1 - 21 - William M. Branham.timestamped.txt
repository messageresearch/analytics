[1:55] do that. The doctors don't even know
[1:57] give some kind of a name, but I think
[1:58] they just made up one to give it that
[2:00] they didn't know what it was. And but
[2:03] Christ knows what it is.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; I can tell you what it is. It's the
[2:06] devil.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; What name they want to give him, that's
[2:13] up to them. But that's what he is.
[2:16] the evil spirit. Now let's all together
[2:19] once together now only believe. Everyone
[2:22] come right out.
[2:24] [Music]
[2:30] [Applause]
[2:34] All
[2:36] my heart
[2:39] [Music]
[2:48] be
[2:54] [Music]
[2:57] all
[2:59] dark.
[3:01] [Music]
[3:07] Let's pray for the girl now as we bow
[3:09] our heads.
[3:11] Our heavenly father seemingly I just
[3:13] can't get it off my mind. The little
[3:16] girl there to die.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; She's somebody's darling.
[3:23] She's your creation.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; And Satan is robbing her of her young
[3:28] life.
[3:31] I pray that in Christ's name that you'll
[3:34] stay the hand of death.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Drive back that enemy. Thou Lord who can
[3:39] make the Red Sea, the wall up on either
[3:42] side and give the children of Israel,
[3:44] thy heritage, a safe journey across the
[3:48] sea and into the promised land. God, we
[3:51] pray today that you'll move back every
[3:54] obstacle and let the child live. It's
[3:58] been given to us to ask and as a group
[4:00] of people believing in thee, we ask in
[4:03] Jesus name for the healing of the child.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Today it's
[4:16] uh with a grateful heart that I I come
[4:19] to you again in the name of the Lord
[4:22] Jesus. I come home just a little early
[4:25] from Louisiana.
[4:27] Um thought maybe if I got here for
[4:30] Sunday I could have Sunday school. And
[4:33] then the weather was so awfully hot
[4:35] there. We this would be mild cool this
[4:39] morning Louisiana. You never set in a
[4:42] building like this with no more than a
[4:44] fan in Louisiana. It' be airond
[4:46] conditioned or you'd be fainting. And so
[4:50] I come sort of to get just a day or
[4:52] two's rest before leaving now right away
[4:54] to northern Saskatchewan
[4:57] next week. And um that's up at Prince
[5:01] Albert. That's as far as roads goes in
[5:03] the world. From the other side you cross
[5:05] all the way over the world without any
[5:06] more roads and nothing but Indians and
[5:10] Eskimos
[5:11] back in the interior past where we go
[5:15] this time. So we have many people will
[5:18] be at this meeting from all over Canada.
[5:22] Some of them will come from from the
[5:23] west coast they say coming over and I
[5:26] certainly desire the prayers of you
[5:28] people that God will meet with us and
[5:30] give us an exceeding abundant great
[5:33] meeting for his glory. It's been some
[5:36] four or five years since I've been in
[5:38] Canada. And I have some real royal
[5:41] friends there that are very fine people.
[5:44] And so they're very uh loyal to go to
[5:47] church. No matter how cold it is,
[5:50] they'll wrap up in a blanket and set on
[5:52] a bobble sled and drive a horse for 30
[5:54] miles to get to go to church. They'll
[5:56] walk through the snow drifts and
[5:58] everything else. Young and old, they all
[6:00] group together. One family gets together
[6:02] and they start walking and they go It's
[6:05] it's the sacrifice that they make is
[6:08] what causes them to get so much out of
[6:10] the service. When there's no sacrifice,
[6:13] there's not very much to the service.
[6:15] But you have to really get down and do
[6:18] something. It hurts real bad. Have to
[6:20] lay aside some things and stop the work
[6:23] and do this or that to get to go to
[6:25] church and show God that you love him
[6:28] and you make a sacrifice to go. It's
[6:30] then when you get something out of it.
[6:32] It's just like my kitties.
[6:36] Billy Paul, I thought I would I didn't
[6:39] get anything when I was a kid. Mama used
[6:41] to get maybe one sack of candy and she'd
[6:44] measure it out two or three pieces each
[6:45] one. Maybe for Christmas we get a little
[6:48] tin horn or a little cap pistol or
[6:51] something. And I've seen other kids with
[6:53] slays and bicycles and things, good
[6:56] clothes and warm jackets.
[6:59] And I I I just made me feel so bad. I
[7:01] said, "If I ever have any children of my
[7:02] own, I'm going to do everything for them
[7:04] I could." Well, I would be willing to go
[7:08] hungry to get something for my kids. And
[7:11] when I lived when Billy was just a
[7:14] little boy, I'd get him a little
[7:16] tricycle and I'd get him everything and
[7:18] Meaty would try everything to sacrifice
[7:21] her own clothes and things to get him
[7:22] something. But you know what? We begin
[7:25] to find out. I got him a little tricycle
[7:27] and a little boy and era and everything.
[7:30] I'd find him with a a spoon or a stick
[7:33] out in the backyard digging somewhere.
[7:36] I said, "The next ones won't be like
[7:38] that." See, you just give anybody
[7:41] everything right on their hand. They
[7:43] don't want it. It's something you have
[7:45] to sacrifice for. And that's the way
[7:48] salvation is. It's a complete sacrifice.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; It is, brother Roy. It's It's a
[7:54] sacrifice that you have to do every day.
[7:57] something to uh to get close to God and
[8:01] to do something. And I know it's a
[8:03] sacrifice you all this morning set in
[8:04] this hot building. As we sit here, let's
[8:07] keep our minds on the greatest sacrifice
[8:10] that mankind ever was given
[8:13] &gt;&gt; to do. That was Jesus Christ when he was
[8:16] charged to come to the earth to die in
[8:18] ourstead. Not only that, but his soul
[8:21] descended into hell and was there for
[8:24] three days and nights. And on the third
[8:26] day, he arose, and now ascended on high,
[8:29] sitting at the right hand of God in
[8:31] heaven, making intercessions upon our
[8:33] confessions of his uh atonement and his
[8:37] grace that's been provided for us. Now,
[8:40] up in the up there where we're going,
[8:42] there'll be many people, real poor, real
[8:46] poor, will have to sell one of their
[8:47] cows, two or three of their sheep or
[8:51] something, get to come to the meeting.
[8:52] The old Eskimo will probably bring out
[8:54] some of his skins and sell them that he
[8:56] really needed for his family to come
[8:58] out. The Indian traitor will have to do
[9:00] the same. Now, we can at least pray for
[9:03] those people, can't we?
[9:04] &gt;&gt; And we pray that God will give him a
[9:06] great thing. Now, it's hot. I don't want
[9:09] to keep you long. And
[9:12] I want us to
[9:16] this morning to fix our minds just
[9:19] before we have prayer for the sick.
[9:22] upon church and its condition.
[9:26] And now I feel that a few days ago that
[9:32] a message to the church was given to me
[9:35] at Streetport Louisiana. And I I believe
[9:40] it's the conditions of the church and
[9:43] we're going to face God with it this
[9:44] morning and pray and ask God to help us.
[9:48] Don't aim to take the same approach, but
[9:52] ask God to help us in this day that
[9:54] we're living. And just before this is a
[9:57] grand old Bible, but just in there lays
[10:00] the contents of eternal life. And
[10:03] remember, the word is God.
[10:08] God is no more than his word and we're
[10:11] no more than our word. And if we make of
[10:14] course now you and I in a different st
[10:17] sense because we can we can say I'll do
[10:21] a certain thing we mean that in our
[10:23] heart but circumstances can arise that
[10:26] we can't we can't do that what we said
[10:28] we would do but God can't do that
[10:32] because he's infinite and he knows
[10:34] everything everything it ever was will
[10:36] be or so he can't make a statement
[10:38] unless he knows he can back it up and
[10:42] Abraham
[10:43] when he was a hundred years old,
[10:46] he called those things which were not as
[10:49] though they were. I'm saying this as
[10:52] encouragement to the ones that's going
[10:54] to be prayed for the sick.
[10:58] Abraham called the things that were not
[11:02] as though they were, counting that he
[11:06] who had made the promise was able to
[11:09] perform or keep that which he had
[11:11] promised.
[11:12] Now when God told Abraham when he was 6
[11:17] 75 and Sarah was 65 that they were going
[11:20] to have a baby. Why? It was altogether
[11:23] impossible.
[11:24] And he believed that and looked for the
[11:27] baby and counted the baby as good as
[11:29] being there for 25 years before the baby
[11:33] ever come. And Abraham was 100 when the
[11:37] baby was born and Sarah was 90
[11:40] because he believed him and called the
[11:44] things which are not as though they
[11:47] were. Now that's to the sick and
[11:50] afflicted to be prayed for. No matter
[11:52] what your troubles are, whether you're
[11:56] what kind of diseases you got, how bad
[11:58] off you are, when you accept Christ, his
[12:02] word, then you call the things which are
[12:06] as though they were not, if they're
[12:08] contrary to God's word. Now, God said,
[12:12] "Prayer of faith shall save the sick."
[12:15] Well, if God said that, that settled it.
[12:17] Then let's put our minds, hopes, and act
[12:20] as though it's already done.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; It's already finished when we accept it.
[12:26] Salvation is the same way. We believe
[12:29] it, accept it, believe it in our heart,
[12:32] walk up before God, and accept Christ as
[12:35] our personal savior and accept him. If
[12:37] you're here this morning and a sinner
[12:39] and not saved and you want to be healed,
[12:42] you're sick, first seek the Lord. accept
[12:47] him as your savior. Then that disease
[12:49] will work right out.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Ever what it is, just put your whole
[12:54] thought to everything that you have on
[12:56] the whole man Christ Jesus.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Everything else will be all right.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; So now keep your mind on that because I
[13:04] said these few words for those who are
[13:06] sick and afflicted. So that I'm going to
[13:08] speak this morning to the church and the
[13:10] condition for I feel that although
[13:13] divine healing is marvelous
[13:16] but when I was in shreport only had
[13:18] about three healing services out from
[13:20] the down there three or maybe four to
[13:22] most out of the 11 days. It's more
[13:24] essential to preach to the souls of man
[13:27] than it is to put so much time on divine
[13:31] healing. Although the people who are
[13:33] sick and needy, God can heal them and
[13:36] it's already been vindicated the world
[13:38] around that he does. But the main thing
[13:41] now is through the soul which will never
[13:43] die.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; The body will die, but the soul will
[13:46] never die. And we must keep that level
[13:48] and straight with God. I've often said
[13:51] this, I want everything done or when I
[13:54] come down the river that morning, I
[13:56] don't want any trouble there. I want to
[13:58] have my ticket in my hand.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:01] waiting for my name. Now I want to say
[14:04] it's Paul of all brother Creature. I
[14:06] know him in the power of his
[14:08] resurrection
[14:10] &gt;&gt; that when he calls from among the dead,
[14:13] I'll come out because I want to know him
[14:16] in the power of his resurrection. So now
[14:18] he who's the author of the book, let's
[14:20] bow our heads and hearts to him just a
[14:23] moment. And God our father, we come to
[14:27] thee now to ask that you'll open your
[14:30] word to us. We can pull back the pages,
[14:33] but only the Holy Spirit can open the
[14:36] word. So open it this morning to us,
[14:38] Father, and give us the exceeding
[14:40] abundant of thy grace. A we wait upon
[14:44] thee and may the Holy Spirit get into
[14:49] the word and give it out through human
[14:52] lips to human hearts and may take it and
[14:56] place it in every heart just as we have
[14:59] need. And when the services is over,
[15:02] we're ready to turn to our homes. We'll
[15:05] humbly bow our heads and give thee
[15:07] thanks and praise for all that we have
[15:09] learned of thee and what thou has done
[15:12] for us. In Christ's name we ask them.
[15:15] Amen.
[15:22] The reading of the word over in St. John
[15:27] the first chapter. you who have Bibles
[15:29] and would like to read with me or mark
[15:33] it down for a text and we read the text
[15:38] from the word and then let praying that
[15:41] the Holy Spirit will take the context
[15:44] out of the word to give to us. We can
[15:47] read it. We who are able to read can
[15:49] read it
[15:52] but only God can bring the context out.
[15:55] The text can be read because it is his
[15:57] word. But then the the context has to be
[16:00] given by God. Now in St. John first
[16:03] chapter and
[16:07] let's begin at the 28th verse and read
[16:10] down to the 32nd inclusive.
[16:14] These things were done see beyond Jordan
[16:19] where John was baptizing.
[16:21] Next day John seeth Jesus coming
[16:25] unto him and said, Behold
[16:29] the Lamb of God,
[16:32] which taketh away the sins of the world,
[16:36] and this is he of whom I said,
[16:39] After me cometh a man, which is
[16:42] preferred before me, for he was before
[16:47] me,
[16:49] and I knew him not,
[16:52] but He
[16:55] but that he should be manifested
[16:58] to Israel. Therefore, I am come
[17:00] baptizing with water.
[17:03] John bear record saying, I saw the
[17:06] spirit descending from heaven like a
[17:09] dove and it abode upon him.
[17:14] I want to read
[17:18] that again,
[17:20] that last verse.
[17:23] 32nd verse. And John bare record,
[17:27] saying,
[17:30] I saw the spirit descending from heaven
[17:33] like a dove, and it abode
[17:36] upon him. And may the Lord add his
[17:40] blessings to the word. I want you to try
[17:44] to to catch every word if we can. Can
[17:48] you hear me? All right. Way back. All
[17:50] right. Can you hear me back there? If
[17:52] you can, you raise up your hand. That's
[17:53] good. Now,
[17:56] I want to speak to you this morning on
[18:00] on par
[18:02] on some way that even the the most
[18:07] unchurched person in here would be able
[18:10] to understand.
[18:13] Now, we come to church to better
[18:16] ourselves. We come to make ourselves
[18:20] better people,
[18:22] better Christians,
[18:24] better citizens,
[18:26] better fathers, better mothers,
[18:29] better neighbors.
[18:32] We come because Christ has told us if we
[18:36] would come as anything
[18:38] in his name were we assembled together,
[18:41] as many as two or three, he would be
[18:43] with us and would grant it to us.
[18:46] So what could be any more uh be any
[18:50] better to us today than to know that we
[18:54] have the church for to em better
[18:56] ourselves to broaden our understanding.
[19:01] How many would say that's what I'm here
[19:02] for? Let's see. I I want a better
[19:04] understanding.
[19:07] And we can't we can't have a better
[19:11] understanding
[19:12] unless it and if we're go to have an
[19:14] understanding of God, it must come out
[19:18] of God's word.
[19:21] For the word is what God gave us to feed
[19:25] our hungry souls.
[19:28] And the Holy Spirit was sent to take the
[19:32] word of God
[19:35] and to feed us by the word.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; You see it? See, we the Holy Spirit is
[19:44] sent from God to take the word of God
[19:47] and to give it to us as we have need.
[19:54] Now, I'm so glad that God made a
[19:56] provision like that, aren't you?
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; That he would feed us.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; We are the sheep of his pasture.
[20:06] We're going to speak on that a little
[20:07] bit. The sheep.
[20:11] And we're the three-fold being of God.
[20:15] And when he can have the complete
[20:16] control of us, he can lead us and guide
[20:19] us.
[20:25] [Music]
