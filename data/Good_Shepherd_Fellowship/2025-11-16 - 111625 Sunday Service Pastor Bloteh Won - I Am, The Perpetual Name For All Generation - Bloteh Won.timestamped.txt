[21:06] All right, let's sit as we listen to
[21:08] Sister Naomi's testimony. God bless you.
[21:33] Want to give God the glory for
[21:35] protecting me Wednesday night.
[21:43] Wednesday is my day off and so I have a
[21:46] lot of work to do that day up at my
[21:48] house and seeing my brothers and all
[21:51] kinds of stuff. And I just love to come
[21:53] to church. So, I come even if I'm tired
[21:56] and I've been praying that the Lord
[22:00] would um please get rid of all the
[22:03] construction going up to St. Cloud so
[22:08] that it's not so hard over the winter.
[22:11] And I was just so blessed. Um
[22:15] initially of course when my daughter
[22:17] actually my daughter Esther taught me
[22:20] always pray before you drive mom you
[22:22] know. works because the Lord protected
[22:25] her once on a major thing. And so she
[22:28] always would do that. So I just like
[22:31] breathe a quick prayer as I take off.
[22:34] And as I'm traveling up to St. Cloud,
[22:36] I'm seeing uh wait a second. Where was
[22:39] that? Uh wasn't there construction over
[22:42] here? And and like looking Wait, wait,
[22:45] wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. I know
[22:46] there was How come the roads are so
[22:48] good? Am I on the right road? And things
[22:50] are going so marvelously well. I was
[22:53] just praising the Lord all the way to
[22:55] St. Cloud. Well, there was a 22 miles
[22:59] from my destination. That's when the
[23:02] construction stopped
[23:04] normally. And so when I got to that
[23:06] spot, I was like, it's it really is
[23:09] done. I am on the right road. This is
[23:11] the right thing. And I just thought,
[23:13] wow, this is just so awesome. I just was
[23:16] having such a feast just praising the
[23:17] Lord all the way there because I was
[23:19] thinking, okay, we got winter coming,
[23:21] icy roads, construction, just, you know,
[23:24] it's got to stop. Well, I was driving
[23:26] behind a semi and I decided, uh, you
[23:30] know, I I just feel like I want to pass
[23:32] him. So, I just went in the left lane,
[23:34] threelane road.
[23:36] Right after I moved over now, there was
[23:41] a deer in the lane on the right side
[23:44] just standing right away after I had
[23:47] turned over. And you know, I was
[23:49] praising the Lord. It didn't even phase
[23:50] me. There he was. The semi was right in
[23:53] the middle.
[23:55] Um I was driving. I just kept on
[23:58] driving. I was having fun with the Lord
[24:00] and I was just like, "Where wait a
[24:02] minute? Where'd that semi go?"
[24:05] And I am I still to the I I don't check
[24:09] reports, but all of a sudden the semi
[24:12] was gone and all the all the traffic
[24:15] that was behind me that was there was
[24:17] quite a bit of traffic. All of a sudden
[24:19] there was no traffic. I just saw little
[24:22] lights off in the distance. I just want
[24:24] to give glory to the Lord because I feel
[24:25] like had I gone in the right lane, I
[24:28] would have hit the deer right off. Had I
[24:31] stayed behind a semi, you can figure out
[24:34] what that would be. So you guys have
[24:36] stuck with me for a little while longer.
[24:38] Praise the Lord.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus this morning. Amen. We want to
[24:46] bless God for such a wonderful miracle.
[24:51] Amen. May God continue to bless and
[24:53] protect us as we drive on um the
[24:56] traffic. Let's go ahead and stand as we
[24:58] praise the Almighty God this morning.
[25:01] Amen. We are here to sing and dance and
[25:04] just worship this morning. Forget about
[25:07] everything. Just focus on him this
[25:09] morning and just bless him. Amen.
[25:15] Yeah.
[25:16] I'm pressing on
[25:19] the upward way.
[25:22] New heights I'm gaining
[25:25] in every day.
[25:28] Stand still and pray
[25:31] as onward bound.

[48:17] faces. Praise the Lord.
[48:20] Amen. And uh this morning we want to
[48:23] greet uh uh brother Kenneth and uh and
[48:29] his wife, Sister Kenny.
[48:33] Praise the Lord.
[48:39] Kenneth, if you and your wife would
[48:41] stand up.
[48:45] And uh it been a while for us to be able
[48:48] to introduce them like this because uh
[48:51] we were we were working on all the the
[48:55] things that needed to be worked on.
[48:56] Amen. But we are glad to have them. They
[48:59] are just from home. They were down with
[49:02] Sister Ke
[49:05] mother and uh George is from there in
[49:08] Connecticut. So I I spotted him on the
[49:11] on the video entering. So I I sent for
[49:14] him to give me the report. So the report
[49:16] is well. So uh we are glad to have both
[49:20] for you with us. Amen. God bless you
[49:22] Rich.
[49:24] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[49:30] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And
[49:32] our sister not being well, but for good
[49:35] cause. So, we will continue to keep her
[49:38] in our prayer that the Lord will
[49:40] continue to strengthen her. Amen. Praise
[49:44] the Lord.
[49:45] And uh before I forget u uh
[49:52] I was just listening to uh uh the tape
[49:56] on my way here and and brother Bon was
[49:58] talking about uh the the sovereignty of
[50:01] the local church and uh so we want to
[50:05] thank God that that God has given us
[50:07] such a thing to be able to guide us. you
[50:10] know that uh that uh one man not me not
[50:14] anybody can have. Uh so there there was
[50:18] a proposed uh uh Thanksgiving dinner
[50:22] that the sisters wanted to to get us
[50:26] together. And uh uh by the way there's
[50:31] there's no service on Wednesday. There's
[50:34] no service on Wednesday. Uh because
[50:36] Thanksgiving some of you will be having
[50:39] your
[50:41] family Thanksgiving. So it's next week,
[50:45] not this week. Oh my god.
[50:49] Praise the Lord. I'm too ahead of
[50:52] myself. Thank you. Thank you for
[50:54] catching me. Not this week. So Wednesday
[50:56] this week we have service. Please.
[50:58] Wednesday this week we will have
[51:00] service. Can you remind me to announce
[51:03] it after service
[51:06] because I'm just too ahead of myself.
[51:08] Praise the Lord. But that week of
[51:10] Thanksgiving, there will be no service
[51:12] Wednesday. We normally do that because
[51:14] either we have a Thanksgiving service on
[51:16] the weekend and Saturday and Sunday. So
[51:19] then we we allow people to spend time
[51:22] with family and friends. And uh and I
[51:25] think the reason why I got ahead of
[51:27] myself a little bit is because uh uh I
[51:30] became a little bit passionate
[51:33] last night or the or the day before just
[51:37] thinking about this whole thing. And the
[51:39] most recent, you know, I was talking
[51:41] with uh uh uh brother Steve or uh
[51:46] brother brother
[51:48] Max uh u you know the reason why I think
[51:53] u uh it is important for us to be able
[51:56] to encourage this is because
[52:00] just having uh time to spend together is
[52:03] also part of our spiritual growth. Time
[52:06] to spend together out of these four
[52:08] walls with me not being behind this pit
[52:12] and and the deacons don't have to put
[52:14] people in their seat and you know and
[52:16] everybody can be able to just be free
[52:19] and converse with one another is a big
[52:22] part of our our growth as a body that we
[52:26] don't we don't get to do much because
[52:30] beside having service we don't want to
[52:32] use this place for anything else and uh
[52:35] so we just cannot organize anything year
[52:39] we we we have uh we want to keep this
[52:41] place just for worship just for prayer
[52:45] and uh uh and then for the preaching of
[52:48] the word but uh
[52:51] so uh so we were able to convince oursel
[52:54] that yeah it's good for us to be able to
[52:56] support that normally we would meet on
[52:58] July 4th we have an outdoor event we
[53:01] never did it this year because uh I was
[53:05] dreaming for the young people to go for
[53:07] camp to have their first experience to
[53:10] be away from home for the week. That was
[53:12] where my my strength was. My my my zeal,
[53:16] my energy was into that. So whatever was
[53:19] happening on on July 4th, I was my mind
[53:22] was not in it. And so I really want to
[53:26] encourage that and and not only for this
[53:30] uh coming uh uh Thanksgiving weekend, it
[53:33] will be on the weekend. It will not be
[53:35] on Thanksgiving day. It will be that
[53:37] Saturday. So you can have your your
[53:39] family time, you know, or visit family
[53:42] and friends on Thursday, but then on
[53:45] Saturday,
[53:47] I think there's a print out of the
[53:49] direction and uh that we will be able to
[53:52] hand out to you. We have uh some copies
[53:55] out there, but we will give them out on
[53:58] Wednesday. we will give them out on uh
[54:01] next Sunday so we can have enough time
[54:03] to to be able to uh prepare ourselves.
[54:07] So uh I think it's almost like a lot of
[54:11] people sisters are different sisters are
[54:13] preparing food and you know bringing uh
[54:17] what to share. Bring your leftovers from
[54:19] your Thanksgiving. I love leftovers.
[54:21] Amen. So uh if I just if one table is
[54:25] just set for leftover, let it be for me.
[54:28] Praise the Lord. So, uh, with that being
[54:32] said, uh, Christmas also falls on
[54:36] Wednesday. Wednesday or, uh, is that
[54:40] right? Wednesday.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Thursday.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:45] So, uh, uh, that week also, we would not
[54:49] have service on Wednesday night, but we
[54:52] will have service on, uh, on the
[54:55] weekend.
[54:57] uh uh Saturday night and Sunday morning.
[55:01] I hope to be able to have our friend,
[55:03] brother Zia Jason, to come and minister
[55:06] for us that weekend. And uh uh and then
[55:11] um
[55:14] and then the 31st
[55:16] falls on
[55:22] Wednesday.
[55:26] Okay. Okay. Okay. We'll get it.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:44] Okay. So, the 31st should be on
[55:46] Wednesday
[55:47] and then we will have our 31st service.
[55:51] for our tele first night service and u
[55:56] we will come in uh uh we'll be seated
[55:59] around about 9 9 a.m.
[56:03] 900 p.m.
[56:05] Somebody help me.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:09] will be seated around 900 p.m. that
[56:12] night and uh if the Lord will lead us
[56:15] the way that feeling lay for the service
[56:18] to go uh uh we will do our worship and
[56:23] thanksgiving and everything just into
[56:27] the the new year and then uh we will now
[56:31] start our our service. We have anything
[56:34] to preach we will do that after but I
[56:37] want for us to express our gratitude in
[56:40] praise and and so one thing I would
[56:43] encourage is that if you want to write
[56:46] your testimony, if you want to express a
[56:48] thanks, you want to write it and give it
[56:50] to the deacon, we will appreciate that.
[56:53] If you also want to write u uh uh a song
[56:57] from the from the songs we sing that we
[57:00] should sing it as a congregation, just
[57:02] write I would love for us to sing this
[57:04] song. Give it to the deacon. We will we
[57:08] will uh because I know we have uh a lot
[57:11] of good singers. They're just shy to
[57:13] come up to sing. So we will now want to
[57:15] call you to uh to to embarrass ourself.
[57:20] So just write if you would love for us
[57:22] to sing a song. Just write our love for
[57:24] us to sing this song and then we will
[57:26] see how much we can be able to
[57:27] accommodate that night. Another thing um
[57:31] I'm I'm thinking on and uh I have to
[57:35] work on uh uh if we stay
[57:38] based on how we going to plan the
[57:40] service uh I will I would like to u
[57:47] offer the u
[57:53] breakfast that morning
[57:55] but uh normally we would use the denny's
[57:58] down the street here but they have just
[58:00] closed so they do not operate. Now I
[58:04] need to find a place. Normally I would
[58:06] go and talk to them and I after the
[58:08] service we would go there but they have
[58:10] shut down. They are closed. So we need
[58:13] to find another place that I need to
[58:15] work for before that time. So uh that is
[58:19] just in the air. Praise the Lord. we can
[58:21] get a place that can be able to
[58:23] accommodate every those that will be
[58:25] here and those that will come. Uh uh I
[58:29] would like for us to have our first meal
[58:31] together. Praise the Lord.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; So uh that is the plan. Uh if I can
[58:39] remind you and remind myself uh not this
[58:42] uh Wednesday, the next Wednesday there
[58:45] will be no service on Wednesday night uh
[58:50] uh for
[58:51] that will be receiving family in and and
[58:54] all of that. Uh you see uh
[59:00] well let me let me just leave you as let
[59:03] me just leave you as there'll be no
[59:05] service and uh if you'll be traveling
[59:09] you have a safe travel those that will
[59:12] be in town and uh uh you can you can
[59:16] visit one another at home and uh meet up
[59:20] You know, I know
[59:23] uh most of us spend our time working.
[59:25] That's that's also good. But we have to
[59:28] realize that the uh the people that God
[59:32] put in our lives and the people that he
[59:34] put around us are very important.
[59:39] Praise the Lord. They are very
[59:41] important.
[59:42] Uh
[59:45] sometimes we don't
[59:48] we get so
[59:50] used to it, the thought of it and even
[59:53] uh you know that we don't we really
[59:56] don't put it in perspective of how much
[59:58] they are important to us until something
[1:00:01] major happen that uh they can you know
[1:00:05] they can be there like we would want
[1:00:07] them to be there. So let's let's uh you
[1:00:11] know let's let's put in time to
[1:00:14] really treasure the ones that God has
[1:00:17] given us. Amen. Praise the Lord. I know
[1:00:22] for some of us and many of us, you know,
[1:00:24] loved ones are far away, but you have
[1:00:26] you have people that you come to church
[1:00:29] with, you know, that you can visit and
[1:00:32] you can, you know, go out for for for
[1:00:37] breakfast, you know, go out for for some
[1:00:40] form of visitation. Let's uh let's let's
[1:00:42] let's appreciate that. I will wish that
[1:00:45] you know in the future as we work on our
[1:00:48] building project if the Lord blesses it
[1:00:50] we have a fellowship hall I mean more of
[1:00:53] that we will do all the time praise the

[1:05:59] Thank you, musicians. Let's take our
[1:06:01] Bibles.
[1:06:02] Amen. Let's take our Bibles and turn to
[1:06:05] Genesis chap chapter 3.
[1:06:10] Exodus chapter 3. Oh my God.
[1:06:14] Oh my God.
[1:06:16] Exodus chapter 3.
[1:06:19] I want to preach a message of faith this
[1:06:22] morning,
[1:06:25] trusting that the Lord will bless it.
[1:06:28] Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:41] While we were over away in Zimbabwe in
[1:06:45] August, there's one of the speakers,
[1:06:48] brother Lubanza from our language, uh,
[1:06:53] he he spoke during the meeting. So he
[1:06:56] said at the beginning that uh he was he
[1:07:00] was not going to preach like a preacher.
[1:07:03] What he wanted to do was to bring
[1:07:05] something that we all can practice.
[1:07:09] So he says I mean we know the word. I
[1:07:11] mean before the preacher called you know
[1:07:13] exactly what he's going to say. The
[1:07:15] biggest problem is that we don't put
[1:07:17] into practice the things that we preach.
[1:07:21] So he started preaching. Uh wonderful,
[1:07:24] wonderful speaker. He started preaching
[1:07:26] and then uh uh there was something he
[1:07:29] said and I I wrote it down. I took a
[1:07:32] note of what he was preaching and then I
[1:07:35] came home. You know, he's he's a brother
[1:07:37] that is he's very blessed in u in
[1:07:41] looking at what he called the soul
[1:07:43] science. He called it the science of the
[1:07:45] soul. And and the way what he does is
[1:07:49] preaching on the consciousness, you
[1:07:51] know, he likes to preach on the
[1:07:53] consciousness. And uh and because he
[1:07:56] says uh he thinks that's what the
[1:07:58] message of the hour has brought us. It's
[1:08:01] a consciousness of God.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; It's not a historical God that is far
[1:08:06] away. It's a God that is here this
[1:08:08] morning.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is a God that is in our midst.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we if we just enter in a little
[1:08:17] bit, you will feel his presence. You can
[1:08:19] get a hold of him. You can talk to him.
[1:08:22] So he's he's gear in that way. He love
[1:08:24] to to go in that direction. So a little
[1:08:27] thought I talk in uh studied on and I
[1:08:30] want to bring to you this morning. So uh
[1:08:32] uh Exodus chapter 3
[1:08:35] just uh uh
[1:08:39] for the scriptural reading, let's read
[1:08:41] from verse one. Now, now Moses kept the
[1:08:44] flood of Jethro, his father-in-law, the
[1:08:48] priest of Midian, and he led the flood
[1:08:50] to the backside of the desert, and came
[1:08:53] to the mountain of God, even to Herod.
[1:08:56] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[1:08:59] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[1:09:02] of the bush, and he looked, and behold,
[1:09:05] the bch
[1:09:07] burned with fire, and the bush was not
[1:09:10] consumed. And Moses said, I will now
[1:09:13] turn aside and see this great sight
[1:09:16] while the bush is not burned. And the
[1:09:19] Lord saw that he turned aside to see.
[1:09:23] God called unto him out of the midst of
[1:09:25] the bush and said, Moses, Moses. And he
[1:09:28] said, Yeah, am I. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Here am I.
[1:09:37] And he said, "Draw not nine, hither. Put
[1:09:41] off thy shoes from off thy feet. For the
[1:09:44] place where on thou standed is a holy
[1:09:46] ground." Moreover, he said, "I am the
[1:09:51] God of thy father, the God of Abraham,
[1:09:56] the God of Isaac,
[1:09:58] the God of Jacob."
[1:10:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] And Moses hid his face
[1:10:09] for he was afraid to look upon God.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Now the conversation went on and the
[1:10:20] Lord start to tell him the reason of
[1:10:22] this visitation
[1:10:24] and we drop to verse 13.
[1:10:28] And after Moses has listened to the
[1:10:30] Lord, verse 13. And Moses said unto God,
[1:10:34] Behold, when I come unto the children of
[1:10:38] Israel,
[1:10:39] and shall say unto them, the God of your
[1:10:42] fathers have sent me unto you, and they
[1:10:47] shall say to me, what is his name?
[1:10:51] What shall I say unto them?
[1:10:56] And God said unto Moses,
[1:10:59] I am that I am.
[1:11:02] And he said, "Thus shall thou say unto
[1:11:06] the children of Israel, I am have sent
[1:11:10] me unto you." Praise the Lord.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father, we want to ask
[1:11:19] blessing upon your word this morning.
[1:11:22] Lord God, we uh labor with prayers and

[1:12:42] I am the perpetual name for all
[1:12:47] generation.
[1:12:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; I pray that I I be able to find the the
[1:12:53] grace and the liberty to be able to
[1:12:56] bring this to you this morning. Amen.
[1:12:59] The per the perpetual name for all
[1:13:02] generation.
[1:13:04] That was that pillar of fire in a
[1:13:07] burning b. I am that I am. There he was.
[1:13:13] that till finally he made you called the
[1:13:18] son of God the I am the Jehovah.
[1:13:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; That I am the Jehovah. The perpetual
[1:13:31] name for all generation. Praise the
[1:13:34] Lord.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:38] This is going to be a little bit out of
[1:13:39] my my my character, but I will try to
[1:13:42] praise the Lord.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I will try to. Now, uh uh as we look at
[1:13:48] this, I was looking at that word
[1:13:50] perpetual
[1:13:52] it defined as this in the Bible.
[1:13:55] Perpetual can means either uh continuous
[1:13:59] uh without interruption or everlasting
[1:14:03] in enduring forever.
[1:14:10] The
[1:14:12] specified meaning depends on the context
[1:14:16] what perpetual is used for in the Bible.
[1:14:18] It talks about uh uh the perpetual
[1:14:22] coveting uh means uh the perpetual
[1:14:25] statue uh speaking about the continuous
[1:14:28] law. Uh perpetual coveting will be the
[1:14:32] everlasting coveting. So perpetual uh uh
[1:14:36] you know uh speaks about an enduring
[1:14:41] okay an enduring uh uh uh you know uh an
[1:14:46] an everlasting
[1:14:48] a continuous a continuous name to all
[1:14:52] generation. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me let me start by saying
[1:14:58] by by introducing my thought like this.
[1:15:02] When the great creator, praise the Lord,
[1:15:05] when the great creator
[1:15:08] uh uh started his creation,
[1:15:11] uh we we we we we
[1:15:16] have to know and understand that uh one
[1:15:20] time God dwed by himself.
[1:15:25] It was just he and he alone.
[1:15:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was he and he alone. And at the
[1:15:33] time he der by himself, he filled all
[1:15:37] space and and and it was just interned
[1:15:40] to God. There was not a beginning. There
[1:15:42] was not an end. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:15:47] But uh
[1:15:49] this great God
[1:15:53] with all his abilities thought that he
[1:15:56] should be able to display his abilities
[1:16:00] and his characters and make himself
[1:16:01] known. So for God to start a creation,
[1:16:07] he has to move from that state of being
[1:16:09] an internal spirit
[1:16:13] to have a beginning.
[1:16:15] Because eternity does do not have a
[1:16:18] beginning.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; So for there to start anything up out of
[1:16:24] eternity, there has to be a beginning.
[1:16:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; So the great internal God in in one
[1:16:33] sense had to condense himself and give
[1:16:38] himself a beginning.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. living from the state of being
[1:16:48] internal spirit. That process of
[1:16:51] condensing himself to take a form.
[1:16:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; That begins the beginning.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; When Moses said in the beginning, when
[1:17:03] John says in the beginning was the word,
[1:17:06] the word was with God. The word was God.
[1:17:10] That is the beginning.
[1:17:12] The beginning was when the great
[1:17:15] internal uh uh uh God
[1:17:19] decided to
[1:17:22] condense himself, take another form and
[1:17:24] start a beginning. So uh uh uh in that
[1:17:28] way we will understand that when God
[1:17:32] started creating
[1:17:34] everything that was created
[1:17:37] had
[1:17:38] a part of God.
[1:17:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; And God in some way after creation, even
[1:17:49] when you read the Bible and you look at
[1:17:51] nature, you will see that he's all in
[1:17:55] his creation.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; His fingerprints are all over the
[1:17:59] creation.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; It it was such it was such uh uh you
[1:18:07] know, beautiful work start by being
[1:18:09] messy work.
[1:18:12] It all start by being messy and then it
[1:18:14] turned out to be beautiful.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; I believe with the anxiousness in his
[1:18:19] thought
[1:18:22] of of of creating expressing his ability
[1:18:26] it was it was all messy. Let me say it
[1:18:29] that way because the the Bible say the
[1:18:31] earth was without form and body and the
[1:18:33] darkness was all so it was messy.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And he has to be gathering this and
[1:18:39] gathering this just just to drama. I
[1:18:41] told you people it's out of my
[1:18:42] character. Amen. But I'm trying my best.
[1:18:45] So bear with me. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And uh and and and and it it has to be
[1:18:50] messy. But the the what I'm trying to
[1:18:52] bring out is that his fingerprints
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; is in everything that he has made.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; It's in everything. go on the mountains
[1:19:06] and just stay on the mountains alone and
[1:19:09] you look down, you see the height, you
[1:19:11] look at the cloud, pretty soon you will
[1:19:13] see his fingerprints.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Just go by the lake and and and and and
[1:19:19] enter into the quietness of the lake.
[1:19:21] Let the lake speaks to you.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; You will feel you will see his
[1:19:24] fingerprints.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; The fingerprint is in everything.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:31] And this great uh uh uh story of uh
[1:19:35] these uh uh you know uh uh people trying
[1:19:39] to trap Jesus. And the Bible says that
[1:19:43] you know they were trying to trap him.
[1:19:45] They were trying to to get him in
[1:19:47] trouble with the Lord. I believe they
[1:19:49] waited to see some some some Roman
[1:19:52] soldier was around and he came around
[1:19:54] and asked Jesus you know uh uh you know
[1:19:57] about paying uh tribute.
[1:20:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:02] And uh and and and we find that there
[1:20:05] the you know when the disciples came to
[1:20:07] Jesus he told them well you gave to
[1:20:09] Caesar what is Caesar
[1:20:12] and then give to God what is God. Praise
[1:20:16] the Lord. But you see before he told
[1:20:18] them that he took
[1:20:21] a coin. He took a Roman coin. Praise the
[1:20:23] Lord.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He took a Roman coin and uh uh uh
[1:20:28] and that coin had an image on it.
[1:20:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And when he took it, he told them whose
[1:20:37] image is this?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; They say Caesar. If you can identify
[1:20:43] that that Caesar image is on this thing,
[1:20:46] then you give to Caesar what his image
[1:20:48] is on.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And then give to God what is God. But
[1:20:53] you will not be able to give to God what
[1:20:56] is God until just like you are able to
[1:20:59] identify Caesar's image on this coin,
[1:21:02] you must identify what the image of God
[1:21:05] is of
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; for you to give it to God.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; If you can tell me that this coin is
[1:21:15] Caesar image, then give to Caesar what
[1:21:17] is Caesar.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Then you give to God what is God. But
[1:21:21] for you to be able to give to God what
[1:21:23] is God, you must also be able to
[1:21:26] identify
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; God's image.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in another sense also Jesus is
[1:21:38] also uh uh you know uh uh proving to us
[1:21:41] that yeah God put his prince. He put uh
[1:21:45] his his his image in in in in making us.
[1:21:50] is not just a statement that we are made
[1:21:52] in the image or the likeness of God. But
[1:21:56] uh just like every faction uh uh
[1:21:59] designer would like to put a little tie
[1:22:02] on the uh on the uh the uh you know
[1:22:05] their design or the clothes that they
[1:22:06] have they have sworn. God also has put
[1:22:09] his signature.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; He has also put his signature. He has
[1:22:15] put his his fingerprint. He has put his
[1:22:18] image
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; on his creation.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Until when he was making known his ways
[1:22:31] to the children of men,
[1:22:37] he showed himself to us
[1:22:40] as uh
[1:22:43] even in the different creatures. We've
[1:22:45] been looking at uh those images. We've
[1:22:47] been using talking about the anointing.
[1:22:50] It is the power of God. The anointing is
[1:22:52] the power of God. But yet God took
[1:22:54] images through the scripture to show his
[1:22:57] anointing.
[1:22:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; So I'm coming down to this to this
[1:23:04] thought that I have in my mind of this
[1:23:07] perpetual name that I am.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] and he sees is a is a is a is a
[1:23:17] perpetual name to all generation. It's
[1:23:20] an everlasting name.
[1:23:23] Not only referring to the the pillar of
[1:23:27] fire that was in the bush, not only
[1:23:29] referring to when Jesus in St. John
[1:23:32] chapter 8 told the disciples that I am
[1:23:38] the one that was with Abraham. But Jesus
[1:23:42] in the gospel of John, you will see he
[1:23:45] used this I am seven
[1:23:48] definite times.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; He was called he says I am the bread of
[1:23:55] life. I am the light of the word. Yes.
[1:23:58] These were Jesus direct statement. I am
[1:24:01] the door to the sheepfall.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; I am the good shepherd. He said
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection and the life.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. I am the way, the truth and the
[1:24:12] life.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And you also say I am the vine and you
[1:24:16] are the branch Jesus.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; So it was not just only identifying
[1:24:24] with that I am that that met with Moses
[1:24:28] or the I am that he proved that was with
[1:24:31] Abraham. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; You will realize that uh God never used
[1:24:38] that phrase I am to Abraham. But when
[1:24:42] Jesus came, he said before Abraham was I
[1:24:46] am.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; So which mean the I am met Abraham.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; But in a different way.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what we want to look at
[1:25:00] this morning because uh in in in a
[1:25:03] simple way that I would say it is that
[1:25:06] we all do bear the I am.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And that's I mean that is the most
[1:25:13] common way that we introduce ourself. I
[1:25:16] am brother one
[1:25:18] time.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; I am brother one. Now, it's it's as as
[1:25:26] as simple as as it looks like.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; I want us to see the the seriousness of
[1:25:32] it.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Because we must realize that the I am IS
[1:25:40] GOD'S PERPETUAL NAME.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; It's his perpetual name. That's that is
[1:25:50] the emphasis I want to make this
[1:25:51] morning.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:54] Amen. That's the emphasis I want to make
[1:25:57] this morning for us to realize that that
[1:26:00] is God's perpetual name
[1:26:09] and uh
[1:26:14] and if we realize that
[1:26:18] pretty soon we will be we we will come
[1:26:20] to consciousness
[1:26:23] that
[1:26:35] that all of our life
[1:26:38] we have we have misused the name of God.
[1:26:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:45] which of course in the ten commandments
[1:26:51] God told the children of Israel that his
[1:26:54] name must not be taken in vain.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Like I said, if you would just if you
[1:27:03] would just channel this thought to
[1:27:04] faith. Yeah. Uh like I said, I want I
[1:27:07] want to I want to speak in a line of
[1:27:09] faith this morning. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in a common way we all we all
[1:27:18] identify ourself with the I am. Whatever
[1:27:21] we add to I am that is our human part.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; That is the part that came after God.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Whatever we we are to I am. I am brother
[1:27:38] one.
[1:27:39] Brother one came after God.
[1:27:43] Do
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; you grab the thought?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Brother one, he came after God.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Because after God has made me
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; and my parents birthed me,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; then they name me one blooded.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; But when WHEN WHEN THAT LIFE was formed
[1:28:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; And that life was was was carried by my
[1:28:14] mother. My parents had to take on a name
[1:28:18] to attach to that life.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; But that life was the life of the I am.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing where I'm going with
[1:28:33] THESE THOUGHTS?
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; THAT LIFE was the life of the I am.
[1:28:40] And then whatever comes after the I am
[1:28:45] that's
[1:28:48] that's the human part.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; So you will realize that whatever we
[1:28:55] connect to I am we become.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; I am is the perpetual is the uh uh
[1:29:09] everlasting name of God.
[1:29:13] His enduring name. Are we together?
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; You will see even the the the the
[1:29:22] seven redemptive names
[1:29:25] of Jehovah.
[1:29:27] It reveals the I am. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am the Lord that health
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; your diseases.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; I am the LORD THAT PROVIDE for you.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; So even in the seven redemptive name
[1:29:46] just as Jesus seven time in the in the
[1:29:49] gospel of John identified himself with
[1:29:52] the I am.
[1:29:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:56] So what I'm trying to bring across to us
[1:29:59] for us to be able to see is they are the
[1:30:02] uh it's it's something that I want for
[1:30:04] us to to to be conscious with conscious
[1:30:08] about. Now on uh on on Wednesday night
[1:30:12] we talked a little bit there in uh uh
[1:30:14] Matthew chapter 22. Let's go back there.
[1:30:18] Let's go back there.
[1:30:21] Matthew chapter 22.
[1:30:30] Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 22,
[1:30:54] before we get to our reading, our
[1:30:56] reading there is in 34, but let's look
[1:30:58] at verse 31. Matthew 22,
[1:31:02] 31, and 32.
[1:31:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:08] Now uh uh 31
[1:31:11] right right there you will realize that
[1:31:13] the the Sadducees were trying to trap
[1:31:16] Jesus. That's where the story began
[1:31:18] from. They were trying to trap Jesus. So
[1:31:20] they came up with this story and said
[1:31:22] well you know in the in the Lord Moses
[1:31:25] said when a man's dying his brother must
[1:31:28] be able to marry his wife to raise up
[1:31:30] child in his name. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to realize it's under
[1:31:36] that same law that Boaz married Ruth.
[1:31:40] It was under that very same law. It's a
[1:31:42] law of redemption. Now, so uh so they
[1:31:45] were trying to trap Jesus and they said,
[1:31:48] "Well, okay, this woman has seven
[1:31:50] brothers and uh uh uh you know, the
[1:31:54] first died, the second died, the tear
[1:31:56] died, the fourth died." And and and so
[1:31:58] they said, "Well, then in the
[1:31:59] resurrection, whose wife is she going to
[1:32:02] be?" If you say there is a resurrection,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says uh uh uh in verse 29,
[1:32:14] Jesus answered and said unto them, you
[1:32:16] heard and know not the scripture, not
[1:32:19] the power of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; You don't know the scripture and you
[1:32:26] don't know the power of God.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; I love that because why? The power of
[1:32:32] God back the scripture. Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The power of God is the
[1:32:36] life behind the scripture. You don't
[1:32:39] know the scripture. You don't know the
[1:32:40] power of God. He said, "For in the
[1:32:43] resurrection, they neither marry. None
[1:32:46] are giving in marriage, but they are
[1:32:48] they they are they are as the angels of
[1:32:52] God in heaven." Praise the Lord.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So another sense there is that you
[1:33:00] don't know the power of God. When we get
[1:33:02] out of this body, the power of God is
[1:33:05] going to take every sinful desire from
[1:33:08] us. Amen. When we get out of this body,
[1:33:10] the power of God is GOING TO TAKE EVERY
[1:33:12] SEXUAL DESIRE FROM THIS BODY.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; So you don't know the power of God.
[1:33:17] That's right.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Because you don't know the scripture.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:20] Now he goes on and he says in verse 31,
[1:33:24] "But as touching the resurrection
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; of the dead,
[1:33:30] have ye not
[1:33:33] read
[1:33:35] that which was spoken unto you by God,
[1:33:40] saying,
[1:33:42] what is he quoting?" Exodus chapter 3.
[1:33:47] Jesus is quoting Exodus chapter 3.
[1:33:49] That's why we just read here in Exodus
[1:33:51] chapter 3 when he met Moses.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; He says, uh, I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; I AM THE GOD OF ISAAC.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; I am the God of Jacob.
[1:34:10] God is not the God of the dead.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you do you see it there in the
[1:34:19] scripture?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; You see what Jesus is identifying
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; being the perpetual name of God. HE
[1:34:25] NEVER APPEARED to Moses and said, "I was
[1:34:28] the God of Abraham."
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE'S NOT THE GOD OF THE
[1:34:38] DEAD.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; IN ANOTHER SENSE, EVEN IF OUR LOVED ONE
[1:34:43] PASS AWAY, THEY ARE NOT DEAD. AS
[1:34:46] CONCERNING THE RESURRECTION, as
[1:34:48] concerning THE MIND OF GOD, IF GOD'S
[1:34:51] name is is is if if the I am is the
[1:34:55] perpetual NAME OF GOD, THEY ARE AS REAL
[1:34:58] AS we are real this morning.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; So he said, you don't know the power of
[1:35:06] God.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; You don't know the scripture. You don't
[1:35:08] know the POWER OF GOD. DEATH DON'T KEEP
[1:35:11] THEM IN THE GRAVE. AS FAR AS TO GOD'S
[1:35:14] MIND, THEY ARE EVEN AS PRESENT as we are
[1:35:17] present.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; SO HE NEVER APPEARED UNTO YOUR FATHERS
[1:35:24] AS I WAS THE GOD OF ABRAHAM. I WAS the
[1:35:27] God of No, no, no, no. He says, I am the
[1:35:31] God of Abraham.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Because I AM NOT THE GOD OF THE DEAD.
[1:35:36] I'M THE GOD OF THE LIVING.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So another THING THERE
[1:35:42] IS THAT WITH THE I AM EVERYTHING LIVE.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO DEAD WITH THE I AM.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING LIVE WITH THE I AM.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; I am the God of the living and not of
[1:36:02] the dead.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; God is not the God of the dead,
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; but the God of the living.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; That's how much powerful
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; this perpetual name is.
[1:36:28] That's how much powerful
[1:36:31] having a consciousness
[1:36:34] to know that
[1:36:39] when I say I am, I'm not talking about
[1:36:42] my abilities.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; When I say I am, I'm referring
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; to the I am.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together this morning? Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; I I I want to labor. I want us to labor
[1:37:00] together to be able to grasp the
[1:37:02] concept.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; It's an everlasting name to all
[1:37:09] generation.
[1:37:12] AND THE ONES THAT HAVE THAT has been
[1:37:15] able to grab the consciousness of this,
[1:37:18] they have enjoyed the benefit of it.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. They have enjoyed the benefit to
[1:37:28] know that uh the I am has attached his
[1:37:32] personality to them.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; As touching the resurrection is not the
[1:37:40] God of the dead,
[1:37:42] but he's the God of the living.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:52] So with the I am everything live.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Everything live.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; And with the I am everything is in
[1:38:03] perfect health.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me not go ahead of myself.
[1:38:15] Let's let's continue the reading. We
[1:38:16] were supposed to go over to uh uh verse
[1:38:19] 34.
[1:38:21] the same reading.
[1:38:24] I'm not the God of the dead and the God
[1:38:26] of the living. Praise the Lord.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Verse 33, the Bible says, "And when the
[1:38:32] multitude heard this, they were
[1:38:34] astonished at his doctrine because that
[1:38:37] was a complete new teaching."
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Those that were dead were referred to
[1:38:44] that they was they were they were dead.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't refer to them as in the
[1:38:50] present tense.
[1:38:53] It's a new teaching. They were
[1:38:55] astonished as this. What is what is he
[1:38:57] saying?
[1:39:00] Praise the Lord. But it was not
[1:39:02] something that Jesus was introducing. It
[1:39:04] was something that God himself
[1:39:06] introduced
[1:39:08] when he met Moses. He said, "I am the
[1:39:10] GOD OF YOUR FATHER ABRAHAM."
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I am the God of Isaac.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; And yeah, just another thing also I I
[1:39:30] want us to see in there. Do you realize
[1:39:32] that the that the Jewish people took
[1:39:34] that as a pattern of praying and they
[1:39:38] never understood what it was all about?
[1:39:42] When the Jew when the Jews pray, they
[1:39:44] pray the God of Abraham, the God of
[1:39:47] Isaac, the God of Jacob,
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; that how they pray,
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; but they really never understood
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; what what it was all about.
[1:39:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT ONLY REFERRING TO A GREAT MAN
[1:40:03] that lived and died.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT GOD WAS REFERRING TO A GREAT
[1:40:12] MAN THAT HE WORKED through and he still
[1:40:15] that same great one today.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; If he says I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM,
[1:40:22] WHICH MEAN I WAS THE ONE THAT CHANGED
[1:40:24] HIS BODY, I CAN CHANGE YOUR BODY TODAY.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE HOW WE can become religious
[1:40:38] and take self
[1:40:40] as common you know you we will YELL
[1:40:43] OURSELVES THE GOD OF WILLIAM BRANDON AS
[1:40:45] BEAUTIFUL as that was
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; he's not a god of the dead.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT A GOD OF THE DEAD. HE'S STILL A
[1:40:55] LIVING God today.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to see the principle here.
[1:41:05] The Bible says, "And when the multitudes
[1:41:07] heard this, they were astonished at his
[1:41:10] doctrine."
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; But when the Pharisees heard had heard
[1:41:14] that he had put the Sadducees to Salem,
[1:41:18] they gathered together. They says,
[1:41:19] "Well, we must attack this man."
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; I love this chapter because when you
[1:41:23] read it from the beginning, it was the
[1:41:26] Herodians that came
[1:41:28] to tempt him. He dealt with them. Then
[1:41:31] the next group was the Sadducees that
[1:41:34] came.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; He put them to sleep.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Now the Pharisees gathered themselves
[1:41:40] and said, "This guy, we got to deal with
[1:41:42] this guy." I love it.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND THE SADDUCEES heard
[1:41:47] that he had put the Sadducees to silent,
[1:41:49] they gathered together. Then one of them
[1:41:51] which was a lawyer, this guy was a
[1:41:54] student." When they say lawyer means a
[1:41:57] student of the word.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can tell you where Moses says
[1:42:02] the page
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; 1963 August 5th.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; At 2 p.m. Brother Brandham said he was a
[1:42:11] student of the word.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that one which was a
[1:42:17] lawyer asked him a question tempting him
[1:42:19] and saying master which is the greatest
[1:42:23] commandment in the Lord.
[1:42:27] Jesus answered, "Thou shalt love the
[1:42:29] Lord thy God with all thy heart, with
[1:42:33] all thy soul, with all thy mind. This is
[1:42:37] the first and the great comming."
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And the second is likely unto it, thou
[1:42:50] shalt love thy neighbor
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; as thyself. On these two commandment
[1:42:56] hang all the laws and the prophet. So
[1:42:58] Jesus broke the ten commandments into
[1:43:01] two.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; And what he did was he TOOK THE FIRST
[1:43:06] FOUR commandment as the greatest
[1:43:09] commandment.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Because the first four commandment
[1:43:17] pertain to God.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, oh Israel, the Lord your God
[1:43:24] is one God. Amen. AND YOU MUST HAVE NO
[1:43:28] OTHER GRAVEN IMAGE. YOU MUST WORSHIP NO
[1:43:31] OTHER GOD BESIDE THIS GOD.
[1:43:34] Praise the Lord. The third commandment
[1:43:37] is you must not take the name of your
[1:43:40] Lord God in vain.
[1:43:45] That's the third commandment. It
[1:43:46] pertains to God. And that's what I want
[1:43:49] to focus on this morning because that I
[1:43:53] am is God's name.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; And I want us to be conscious how we are
[1:43:58] using I am.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; When you say I am, you have to be
[1:44:04] conscious how you are using I am.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do this morning.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Did you grab my line of thought? Have I
[1:44:17] lost you?
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Let's stay together.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; And the fourth commandment is
[1:44:26] the rest. The Sabbath day
[1:44:30] is also pertaining to God.
[1:44:34] Now it's it's it's is it's beautiful
[1:44:36] when you look at it that Jesus here will
[1:44:39] split the ten commandments into two. He
[1:44:43] will take six, which good is the number
[1:44:46] of men. Just like I said Wednesday
[1:44:48] night, you don't need to be a Christian
[1:44:51] to love your father and mother.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; There are SOME THAT DO IT BETTER THAN
[1:44:56] PEOPLE IN CHURCH.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; You don't be you don't need to be a I
[1:45:00] mean A GOOD NEIGHBOR WILL NOT BEAR FALSE
[1:45:03] WITNESS.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE HE BROKE IT INTO TWO THAT
[1:45:10] THERE IS ONE THAT IS OPERATED BY A
[1:45:13] NATURAL LORD
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; AND THE OTHER ONE THE OTHER FOUR THE
[1:45:17] FIRST FOUR THAT HE CALLED THE GREAT
[1:45:19] COMMANDMENT IS OPERATED BY A SPIRITUAL
[1:45:22] LORD.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SPIRITUAL LORD THAT GOVERN THE
[1:45:31] MAN NOT TO WORSHIP IDOLS. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:45:35] WE CAN MAKE ANYTHING AN IDOL.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; THERE THERE HAS TO BE A SPIRITUAL LAW
[1:45:40] THAT IS GOVERNING YOU IN YOUR BODY FOR
[1:45:43] YOU NOT TO TAKE THE NAME of the Lord God
[1:45:45] in vain.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS THAT LORD I want to activate
[1:45:51] this morning.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; I want to activate that Lord
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; so WE WILL NOT TAKE THE name of our Lord
[1:45:58] in vain. When you say I am.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will watch what you are
[1:46:04] associating I am with.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; You know the the Lord have a sense of
[1:46:13] human.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; I was listening to the song and brother
[1:46:19] Lawrence was singing
[1:46:21] uh
[1:46:23] uh Jesus lamb of God. Amen. I wrote it
[1:46:26] here so I won't forget forget.
[1:46:30] The song says,
[1:46:34] "You are my strength
[1:46:36] when I am weak."
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; That's what the song says.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; And he s you are my strength when I was
[1:46:45] weak.
[1:46:46] So when he sank it, I felt funny. I he
[1:46:50] can't see.
[1:46:53] I said I in my mind I says well the
[1:46:55] words are up there. exist when I am
[1:46:57] weak. Then right away I thought
[1:47:01] in my mind because it's on my note here.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; You don't associate weakness to I am.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; You don't associate weakness to I am
[1:47:18] because I am is never weak. Let the weak
[1:47:20] say.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; You don't associate weakness to our
[1:47:28] name. It is the perpetual name of God.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Now, okay, let's let's read uh Okay, I'm
[1:47:45] talking about these two commandments.
[1:47:46] Let me stay right in here. I went ahead
[1:47:48] of myself. But now so you see here is
[1:47:51] that he he breaks the ten commandments
[1:47:54] into two
[1:47:56] and he show us what is called the great
[1:47:59] commandment. What he called the great
[1:48:01] commandment is is is the portion of the
[1:48:04] commandment that is operated on the
[1:48:06] spiritual law.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:13] There there there are people that don't
[1:48:15] believe uh in uh uh in the God of
[1:48:18] Israel. They don't believe that there is
[1:48:19] one God.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; But yet when it comes to the rest of the
[1:48:24] sis commandment,
[1:48:26] they can be dedicated to it. They they
[1:48:28] love their parents.
[1:48:30] They they will not steal. They will not
[1:48:32] commit adultery. I mean those things are
[1:48:35] operated in the natural law.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; You find people that God has blessed. I
[1:48:45] mean maybe they they never had the grace
[1:48:47] to be able to see truth. They never had
[1:48:50] the grace to be I mean to to really be
[1:48:52] able to convince that there is a living
[1:48:54] God. So they don't go to church. But yet
[1:48:58] they keep those natural law.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's govern. It's a natural law.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; You don't need to be born again. You
[1:49:07] don't need to be baptized.
[1:49:14] Just simple. There was a man and a woman
[1:49:17] that brought you in this world and you
[1:49:18] owe him that respect. Simple.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; There is no We don't need to preach
[1:49:22] mystery about it.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; We don't need to convince you that there
[1:49:26] is a promise that is attached to it
[1:49:28] before you will obey your parents.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; It's a natural law.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; But when IT COMES TO THE FIRST FOUR, I
[1:49:38] want to dwell on the tier one. taking
[1:49:41] the name of the Lord God in vain. That's
[1:49:43] what I want to spend my strength this
[1:49:44] morning. But before that, let's look at
[1:49:46] the fourth one,
[1:49:50] keeping the Sabbath.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Which of course are religious people
[1:49:57] have argued about it whether it is
[1:49:58] Saturday, whether it is Sunday and and I
[1:50:01] mean whether we can do this or we cannot
[1:50:03] do that.
[1:50:06] But you have to know h or realize this
[1:50:09] morning church is that because of
[1:50:13] disobedience the breaking of that
[1:50:15] commandment to the Jewish people that's
[1:50:18] what make them to spend the years they
[1:50:20] spent in Babylon
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID BECAUSE YOU HAVE REFUSED TO
[1:50:26] allow the land to rest
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; I will take you away into captivity and
[1:50:31] I will give the land rest.
[1:50:35] Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; So God demand rest.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; And he want you to honor it.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; He want you to honor it.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:55] Because I mean they they started
[1:50:57] prospering and and and they got so busy
[1:50:59] they need to they I mean they need to
[1:51:02] get their product out you know they have
[1:51:03] they have now h make a trade agreement
[1:51:07] with this nation and that nation and all
[1:51:09] of that. So they were just they were
[1:51:11] just sewing the land and plotting the
[1:51:13] land and plotting the land and plotting
[1:51:15] the land and plotting the land. And
[1:51:17] sometimes that is the very same thing we
[1:51:18] do to our body.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:23] Sometimes that's the very same thing we
[1:51:25] do to our body. Praise the Lord.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's the very same thing we
[1:51:33] do to our body. I need to
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; I need to preach this to myself.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:44] And uh uh so as as you look in the
[1:51:47] scripture, you will realize that uh uh
[1:51:50] Paul took that subject when he
[1:51:53] understood that the rest was not just h
[1:51:56] a physical rest. He he took that in the
[1:51:59] book of Hebrew and he explained to us
[1:52:01] what the rest was. He took it right back
[1:52:03] to Genesis that after God has labored
[1:52:07] sixth day, he rested the seventh day.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so so we we we we get to
[1:52:14] the place to to see and understand in
[1:52:17] one sense the rest was not just uh you
[1:52:20] know uh uh uh uh natural lying down to
[1:52:24] rest it for God it was a change of
[1:52:27] dispensation.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; It was a change of dispensation because
[1:52:31] now God has made a man in his image. He
[1:52:35] got a man that could do the work. So
[1:52:37] what he did? He rested. Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; He rested by transferring authority to
[1:52:42] that man. That's what make Adam the God
[1:52:45] of the earth. Amen. He transfer every
[1:52:47] authority to that man and he rested. He
[1:52:50] was no longer That's why Adam had to
[1:52:52] name the creatures. He had to name the
[1:52:54] plan. God was not doing any work again.
[1:52:56] So in another sense, God was resting in
[1:53:00] his son.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; That's why comes the concept of the Holy
[1:53:04] Ghost being our rest.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's THAT'S WHAT BRING
[1:53:09] THE CONCEPT THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS our
[1:53:12] rest. AND THEN PAUL WILL say in the
[1:53:14] Hebrew, praise the Lord,
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; that uh uh uh uh
[1:53:21] he says in the Hebrew, he he type it in
[1:53:24] a way that uh until you rest, until you
[1:53:29] come to rest,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; The remaining rest.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. They enter into the rest.
[1:53:35] Okay. there remain in the rest for the
[1:53:37] people of God. That's what he said. And
[1:53:39] uh uh but he brought it in a way that uh
[1:53:42] uh uh
[1:53:45] is it's in two ways.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:55] When God comes to rest,
[1:53:58] he has found a son or a daughter.
[1:54:05] that he has trusted for that job.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; And on the other hand
[1:54:16] is that God cannot really get to work
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; until you come to rest.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a competition here.
[1:54:26] Both of you not going to be working at
[1:54:28] the same time.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; You got You got the concept.
[1:54:35] There's not going to be a competition
[1:54:36] between God. I want to do it. No. Let me
[1:54:38] do it. Let me do it. No. No. It's either
[1:54:41] one person.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO GET THAT'S WHY PAUL WHO SAYS
[1:54:49] HE'S THE HIGH PRIEST OF OUR CONFESSIONS.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO GET HIM TO WORK, you must
[1:54:54] come to rest on the matter.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. FOR HIM TO GET YOU TO
[1:55:02] REST
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; OR GET YOU TO work
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; in your calling. He also come to rest.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Are you grappling the the concept?
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; I mean it's it's not striving. Let me do
[1:55:18] it. No. God said let me do it. No. He
[1:55:20] said let me do it. No. No.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; He his spirit will not strive with men.
[1:55:24] That's what he said.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; He's not striving with men.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU EITHER ALLOW GOD TO DO IT OR
[1:55:30] YOU DO IT YOURSELF.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL EITHER DO IT OR he will get a
[1:55:36] man to do it.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; SO THEN WE UNDERSTAND WHY THE SABBATH
[1:55:45] DAY IS UH h the the the fourth
[1:55:48] commandment. Why? Why it is why IT IS
[1:55:52] DIVINE? WHY it is operated
[1:55:55] supernaturally or spiritually? Why is it
[1:55:58] not under a natural law like the rest of
[1:56:01] the six?
[1:56:05] BECAUSE GOD HIMSELF CALLED THAT DAY MY
[1:56:08] DAY. He said it is my day.
[1:56:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; It is my day. Do you know that it is out
[1:56:19] of the Sabbath that comes the tithes?
[1:56:26] Whatever we whatever we give to God.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Out of the Sabbath comes it.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Now you will understand here when we go
[1:56:35] further here. He says here the first
[1:56:38] commandment. WHAT DID HE SAYS? LOVE the
[1:56:40] Lord
[1:56:42] God with all of your heart AND ALL OF
[1:56:46] YOUR SOUL and all of your mind.
[1:56:50] You will see that if you go back, Moses
[1:56:53] said this uh uh uh
[1:56:56] let me let me just uh I never thought
[1:57:00] about it until now. It just it just came
[1:57:03] to my mind. So
[1:57:06] let me take this also.
[1:57:12] Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you look in in in the
[1:57:18] Gospel of Mark, you will see where Jesus
[1:57:22] referring to this very same thing. Mark
[1:57:24] uh 12:30, he says, "And thou shall love
[1:57:26] the Lord with all of your heart, all of
[1:57:28] your soul, all of your mind, and all of
[1:57:31] your strength."
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; That's that's the word I wanted to put
[1:57:34] there.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. In all of your strength. Uh uh
[1:57:38] Mark chapter 30. Now, so you will see
[1:57:42] that uh the reason why the reason why uh
[1:57:46] uh uh he demanded the rest of the land,
[1:57:49] he demanded a Sabbath
[1:57:52] because he's the God of our strength.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; And we must we must acknowledge there
[1:57:58] that he gave us strength for us to wake
[1:58:01] up in the morning. He gave us strength
[1:58:03] for us to do whatever that we are doing.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; We must be conscious of that.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; And if the one that gave us strength
[1:58:14] says we must rest, then let's honor it.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Let's honor it. And it's not just only
[1:58:23] uh you know uh uh having a good night
[1:58:26] rest. That's good. If is is important.
[1:58:29] Amen.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Taking the day off to sleep, that is
[1:58:31] good. Is is important also. Praise the
[1:58:33] Lord. But we must realize that true rest
[1:58:36] is in the Lord. Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; True rest is in the Lord. It's is uh is
[1:58:44] is connecting with your maker.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; It's returning back to him and bringing
[1:58:49] thanks and and and bringing praise.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; As much as it looks like, you know, we
[1:58:56] we we rush here to service, we sing and
[1:58:59] dance, uh I mean, in another sense, we
[1:59:02] are bringing a sense of true rest to
[1:59:04] God.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because everything we do here, we
[1:59:08] want to rest upon him.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; We want to depend upon him. Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; You know, that's the reason why brother
[1:59:23] Brandon says something like uh uh you
[1:59:26] know, if a person will forsake church
[1:59:28] and go fishing on Sunday, he says uh
[1:59:31] that that looks like dishonoring
[1:59:34] the Sabbath.
[1:59:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Now try just we're trying to bring
[1:59:51] ourself to a sense of consciousness.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; We're living in a changing word. Praise
[1:59:57] the Lord.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; We're living in a changing world. We're
[2:00:00] living in a word that is getting that is
[2:00:02] getting busy. We cannot hold this word
[2:00:04] like like like it was held before.
[2:00:06] Everything is falling apart.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then uh uh uh uh sometimes we
[2:00:14] we we we have to take care of our
[2:00:17] family. We have to take care of
[2:00:18] ourselves and you know take care of our
[2:00:21] home and every other thing.
[2:00:23] But then also we must be conscious that
[2:00:26] he told us to love him with all of our
[2:00:28] strength.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Loving him with all of our strength. So
[2:00:35] if if it turn out to the place that I I
[2:00:37] can't be in church on Sunday morning uh
[2:00:40] because I have to be to work and and and
[2:00:42] that's what my work required of me and
[2:00:45] I'm going to go to work.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm also going to be conscious.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; I'm also going to be conscious.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; I must find a way to be able to honor
[2:00:58] the Sabbath.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:01:01] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; I must find a way to be able to honor
[2:01:05] the Sabbath than to just cast it away
[2:01:08] and says, "Well, you know, I supposed to
[2:01:09] be to work today. You know, it's just
[2:01:11] work." No, I must find a way because we
[2:01:14] have to realize that the the the
[2:01:16] Sabbath, he says uh uh uh the Sabbath uh
[2:01:20] uh was not uh made for men. Man was made
[2:01:23] for the Sabbath. That what Jesus said.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "I am the Lord of the Sabbath.
[2:01:28] come unto me all you that labor
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; and have heavy laden. So you see there
[2:01:35] is there is more consciousness than just
[2:01:39] honoring a day.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Or just honoring uh h certain rituals
[2:01:45] that we must not drink water on a
[2:01:47] Sabbath, we must not eat meat on a
[2:01:48] Sabbath. You know instead of just
[2:01:50] organizing it, there is a concept
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; that he's trying to bring to us.
[2:01:57] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Because he's not the God of the dead,
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; he's the God of the living.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; So, knowing that it is his day, WE WE WE
[2:02:09] TRY TO HONOR IT. For a MATTER OF FACT,
[2:02:11] EVERY DAY IS HIS DAY.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; AND SO, EVERY DAY OF OUR LIFE, WE TRY TO
[2:02:17] FIND A WAY TO HONOR GOD IN OUR LIFE.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE TRY TO FIND A WAY TO BE
[2:02:22] CONSCIOUS TO BRING OUR PRAISE, OUR
[2:02:24] GRATITUDE, OUR thanksgiving to him.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Whether I can do IT IN THE MORNING OR I
[2:02:28] CAN DO IT IN THE AFTERNOON OR I CAN DO

[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:51] We cannot cast honor in the Lord.
[2:02:55] There are things that life demand.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; We have to attain onto it.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; But then we must also have the
[2:03:02] consciousness.
[2:03:05] Now I need to honor the Lord.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Love him with all of my strength.

[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. love him WITH ALL OF MY
[2:03:18] mind
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; and my then my thoughts will go my
[2:03:21] question will go to you this morning.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; How do we love God with all of our
[2:03:31] heart?
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; How do we love him with all of our mind?
[2:03:35] What what is that all about? How do we
[2:03:37] love God with all of our strength?
[2:03:40] What is it all about?
[2:03:44] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; What is it all about?
[2:03:52] And then we will soon realize here that
[2:03:54] uh uh uh
[2:03:58] when the scripture speaks in this sense
[2:04:02] because
[2:04:03] no one goes to the theater at the
[2:04:06] hospital and go and do a surgery to be
[2:04:09] able to reach down in their heart
[2:04:13] to even find your soul
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; or to even be able to take out that
[2:04:17] element of the love of God that is in
[2:04:19] your heart. Amen.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Science cannot find it. Medical doctors
[2:04:25] cannot search it.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; They cannot go in your brain and and
[2:04:28] look for your mind.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; There is nowhere in your brain called
[2:04:33] your mind.
[2:04:37] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; It's another word is what the Apostle
[2:04:46] Paul would call your spirit man.
[2:04:50] It's another word. It's another being.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit being.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; It's the real you.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; This is just your vehicle. This is not
[2:05:07] you. This is your vehicle. The rear you.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; It is WITH THAT REAR YOU THAT YOU LOVE
[2:05:17] the Lord.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL OF YOUR HEART AND ALL OF YOUR
[2:05:20] MIND AND ALL OF YOUR STRENGTH.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; THAT REAR YOU THAT PICKS UP THIS BODY.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; THAT TAKES THIS BODY FOR A SHOWER.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they don't even want to brush
[2:05:36] his teeth. You got to tell him to brush
[2:05:37] his teeth.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:45] So you we realizing that uh uh uh uh
[2:05:48] there is something uh uh uh uh more
[2:05:51] about you.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; There is something more about our self.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; So that first and great commment is
[2:06:04] operated by a spiritual lord. The second
[2:06:07] one is operated by a natural lord.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Now, so we want to dwell on the terror
[2:06:15] one taking the name of the Lord thy God
[2:06:18] in vain.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; That's why we we try to wrap this thing
[2:06:22] up this morning. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Have I given you faith? Did you see that
[2:06:28] you have got some sense of faith?
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:35] just just having uh having that
[2:06:38] consciousness, you know, of of who we
[2:06:41] are, who really we are.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; And what we supposed to do in every
[2:06:49] given time. So just like I said here, if
[2:06:52] we if we use the I am
[2:07:02] whenever we connect the I am whatever we
[2:07:06] connect the I am to we become
[2:07:08] because it's powerful.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; When you say I'm sick,
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; you are sick.
[2:07:18] You are really sick.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; If you say that, you know, I'm poor,
[2:07:32] then you are really poor.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; But that's that's not really the sense
[2:07:37] of what I'm where I'm going to this
[2:07:39] morning. where I'm going to is that uh
[2:07:42] uh you know somewhere where Abraham
[2:07:44] talks about speaking the devil's
[2:07:45] language.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's more in a sense that those
[2:07:50] are things that we must not say.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:56] When we use the I am wrongly we are
[2:07:58] using the Lord's name in vain.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:10] Because because it is his perpetual
[2:08:13] name.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; So whatever you attach the I am told you
[2:08:18] are giving life to that thing.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; I want us to see it in that way.
[2:08:28] That's the reason why the scripture will
[2:08:31] will will speak to us in this way. Let
[2:08:34] the weak says I'm strong. Yes.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not a place of deny.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; I can say I'm feeling weak
[2:08:44] but I'm strong by his grace.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me let me bring another one
[2:08:51] that is very common for us.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Let me bring another one that is very
[2:08:56] common for us. Uh uh Ephesians chapter
[2:08:58] 2.
[2:09:02] Ephesians chapter 2.
[2:09:07] You know sometime these things just
[2:09:09] become good sermon
[2:09:11] and then we go away
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; and never put it into practice.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; But I hope that the Lord will help us.
[2:09:22] Amen. You read Ephesians chapter 2,
[2:09:24] Ephesians 2:5,
[2:09:26] the Bible which says uh uh verse 4, but
[2:09:29] God who was rich in mercy for his great
[2:09:31] love were when he loved us even when we
[2:09:34] were dead in sin have quickened us
[2:09:39] together with Christ by grace. Yay, I
[2:09:44] saved.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that it is from this
[2:09:49] scripture that that common saying we are
[2:09:52] sinners saved by grace?
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; That's where the scripture that's where
[2:09:57] that phrase came from
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; from this scripture. We are sinner saved
[2:10:01] by grace.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; How are we associating saved by grace
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; with sinner?
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; If you are a sinner saved by grace then
[2:10:11] you are no longer a sinner.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:15] How are we associating the two?
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; But you see that's the way the human
[2:10:23] mind, our human mind try to accommodate
[2:10:28] God's word.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Because it makes us to feel right
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; that I know I'm a sinner saved by grace.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if IT'S A WORK THAT IS ALREADY
[2:10:45] DONE,
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; if the save BY GRACE IS A WORK THAT IS
[2:10:49] ALREADY DONE IN YOUR LIFE,
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; THEN YOU ARE NO LONGER a sinner.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; It's like you saying, I'M I'M A SICK
[2:11:05] PERSON that is already healed by his
[2:11:08] strife.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:11] Hallelujah.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; AND BY HIS STRIPES YOU ARE HEALED.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Then you are no longer sick.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Are are you seeing what I'm talking
[2:11:23] about?
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; It's it's a it's a realm of faith. It's
[2:11:29] a it's it's a it's a it's a it's a
[2:11:31] channel that God trying to bring us
[2:11:34] through because Peter said whereby he
[2:11:37] has given unto us his divine nature.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; How can we have God's divine nature and
[2:11:44] we have such a poor confession.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Tell it.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN WE BE POSSESSOR OF HIS divine
[2:11:52] nature? Now you will see that the the
[2:11:55] the the church word and uh and and and
[2:11:58] and and the care master word has run
[2:12:01] with this without wisdom.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; They have run with it without wisdom in
[2:12:09] a sense that people are professing
[2:12:11] wealth. People are professing you know
[2:12:14] whatever they are professing they don't
[2:12:16] have nothing on God's word to base their
[2:12:19] profession.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BUT WE HAVE HIS WORD.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE CAN GO BACK TO ISAIAH 53. WE
[2:12:28] CAN GO BACK TO THE PROMISES OF GOD.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; We have something that we can rest our
[2:12:33] FAITH ON.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; THEN WHY SHOULD WE BE AFRAID TO EXPRESS
[2:12:36] IT?
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE ARE NOT DEPENDING ON OURSEL BUT
[2:12:40] WE ARE DEPENDING ON what God has
[2:12:42] promised.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:53] Amen.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; You are giving you are giving life or
[2:12:59] you are giving birth
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; to whatever negative things
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; you attach to our image.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:17] When you see an I am is God speaks until
[2:13:20] you add another word to it.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; And whatever you are to it, you are
[2:13:25] speaking the father's language or you
[2:13:28] are speaking the devil's language.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Praise praise the Lord.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; I could say, well, my head is hurting,
[2:13:38] but I am healed.
[2:13:41] That's good.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Because that's what that's what I am. My
[2:13:47] head is hurting me.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; But when it COMES TO I AM, I am don't
[2:13:52] have headache.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense?
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Or am I just in my own word?
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; My body is weak,
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; but I am strong.
[2:14:12] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Because that's what I am is. I am is
[2:14:16] strong.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; I am is not weak.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just it just it just some of
[2:14:34] these things uh you know uh as as as as
[2:14:37] as Christians we we don't we don't
[2:14:40] realize. See what Paul says here in in
[2:14:42] in Philippian he says he being God
[2:14:47] speaking about Jesus
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; taught in not robbering.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; So Jesus could be robbing God.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. if he just choose to be called the
[2:15:02] father of Joseph and Mary.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE TOLD HIM I must be about my
[2:15:08] father's business,
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; he was not robbing God.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; So take that principle and apply it to
[2:15:16] what we are saying.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; How we can rob God
[2:15:22] when we associate the I am
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; to our failures.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; I'm just a failure.
[2:15:31] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; I'm just nothing. No, I am may all
[2:15:36] think.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; I am was the one that make all things. I
[2:15:40] am is not nothing.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU TAKE THAT PRINCIPLE of robbing
[2:15:51] God,
[2:15:53] robbing God is in is is is the SENSE OF
[2:15:56] NOT ALLOWING GOD
[2:16:00] TO BE ABLE TO REVEAL himself through you
[2:16:05] and in you as he's supposed to.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to find another way to say
[2:16:18] this.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to find another way to say it
[2:16:24] to to to make sure that that it lands
[2:16:27] because what I I was I was thinking
[2:16:29] about this and and then uh uh when I
[2:16:31] when I when I fell on this thought that
[2:16:34] uh this is the perpetual name of God to
[2:16:38] all generation.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; It just blew my mind.
[2:16:45] I've I've just I've meditated on this uh
[2:16:48] night and night.
[2:16:54] The perpetual name of God to all
[2:16:57] generation.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:06] So Almighty God, the great internal one
[2:17:12] attach himself.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; brother will tell us about keys. Keys to
[2:17:17] life. This is a key.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; This is a key.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; It's a key
[2:17:28] to be able to to to be able to to to
[2:17:31] help us alone because a a It have you to
[2:17:35] go with the consciousness
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; of the God youself.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; You are not breaking in your strength.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; But you you you are you are having this
[2:17:48] consciousness that he SAID I WILL NEVER
[2:17:51] LEAVE YOU.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; I WILL GO WITH you even to the end.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; AND IF HE'S WITH YOU THEN I AM IS NOT
[2:18:01] THE GOD OF THE DEAD. I AM IS THE GOD OF
[2:18:03] THE LIVING.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; It's a key.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something and I close
[2:18:15] here. I was I was I'm I'm standing on
[2:18:19] the subject
[2:18:20] of of backsliding.
[2:18:23] I fell on a beautiful material that I
[2:18:26] that I've been I've been reading
[2:18:29] listening to and is on the subject of
[2:18:32] backsliding.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; And as I look into the material and look
[2:18:37] at the subject, I start to see it very
[2:18:40] different.
[2:18:43] I start to see it very, very different.
[2:18:46] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Man, just last night, I was meditating
[2:18:50] on this thought as I lay back there and
[2:18:52] just reading on my phone.
[2:18:56] Bird says, uh, you know, he is talking
[2:18:58] about backsliding. We backslide every
[2:19:00] day.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; He said we backslide every day.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; And then he says, carrying on that
[2:19:12] thought, he says we don't backslide
[2:19:14] before God.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; We backslide before one another.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Then carrying on the
[2:19:23] thought he went on and says and that's
[2:19:25] the reason why the apostle Paul says I
[2:19:28] have to die daily.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Now if you think about backsliding in
[2:19:33] that way
[2:19:36] you realize that it's good.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; It's good.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; It's not good BECAUSE I HAVE PLEASURE in
[2:19:46] backsliding. is good because it gave me
[2:19:49] the consciousness to to to to to take an
[2:19:52] inventory of my life. It gave me a
[2:19:55] consciousness that if I'm GOOD IN THIS
[2:19:57] AREA, this area I might not be good in.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It does not make me a a one lane
[2:20:10] believer. IT MAKES ME A BALANCED
[2:20:13] BELIEVER.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:20:16] Praise the Lord.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; BACKSLIDING.
[2:20:20] The thought OF IT TAKE ALL UH UH UH uh
[2:20:24] you know uh uh a religious spirit. It
[2:20:27] takes every religious spirit from you.
[2:20:29] BASHID PUTS YOU TO THE place where the
[2:20:32] rubber meets the road.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; You are real with yourself.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; You are real with others. You're not
[2:20:40] putting on anything for nobody.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:45] If it meet the rubber meets the road
[2:20:47] because you become CONSCIOUS THAT I HAVE
[2:20:49] TO DIE DAILY. If Christ will live in me
[2:20:53] then there is SOMETHING IN MY LIFE I
[2:20:55] NEED TO FIND OUT TO give up.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; I need to GIVE SOMETHING UP. I NEED TO
[2:21:02] SURRENDER SOMETHING. I NEED HIS GRACE
[2:21:04] every day.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; But that's not what we're preaching this
[2:21:10] morning.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:14] WHY? BECAUSE UH WE NEED THAT
[2:21:16] CONSCIOUSNESS.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; WE MUST NOT JUST BE GOING WITH THIS FLAG
[2:21:20] OVER OUR HEAD. I'm a message believer. I
[2:21:23] baptized in Jesus name. You know, I I I
[2:21:25] believe the prophet OF THE HOUR. THAT IS
[2:21:27] NOT ENOUGH.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; That is not enough. What are we doing
[2:21:33] with it?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THIS GRACE THAT
[2:21:37] HAS COME TO US?
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:44] Do we look for an opportunity to share
[2:21:47] this glorious grace
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; that has come to us?
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Or we just wear it like an
[2:21:54] identification
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; and everybody should leave the role
[2:21:58] because I'm a message believer. I'm the
[2:22:00] bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; I have the ego anointing on me.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; So just clear the way. Can you see me?
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we announce oursel by our
[2:22:13] sweats.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; But think about it this morning.
[2:22:30] The perpetual name
[2:22:33] of Jehovah.
[2:22:35] Praise the Lord.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:39] was given to you right from birth.
[2:22:42] He attached his name to you
[2:22:46] that through you Mary can see his
[2:22:48] greatness
[2:22:50] can see his mercy.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; And whenever he says I am,
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; we don't use it like the word use it. We
[2:23:02] become very conscious that whatever I
[2:23:05] associate I am with
[2:23:08] and giving life to that thing.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; We become conscious of it.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; That is by no means for us to live in
[2:23:20] deny.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; We can feel our pains. We can see our
[2:23:24] struggle.
[2:23:25] But if God is not the God of the dead
[2:23:27] and he's the God of the living,
[2:23:31] then let us also believe and realize
[2:23:33] that he knows our pain and he knows our
[2:23:36] struggle. Amen.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; And by confessing his name is is an
[2:23:42] avenue of breaking him under sin.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come
[2:24:08] while we close up here with our
[2:24:10] continuous reading here in in all gospel
[2:24:12] of Ephesians.
[2:24:38] Praise the Lord.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:00] Ephesians 2:5 even when we were dead in
[2:25:03] sin
[2:25:06] have quickened us together with Christ
[2:25:08] by grace are you saved
[2:25:12] and have raised us up together and made
[2:25:14] us to sit together in heavenly places in
[2:25:17] Christ Jesus
[2:25:19] that in the ages to come he might show
[2:25:21] the exceeding riches of his grace.
[2:25:25] in in his kindness towards to us uh
[2:25:29] towards us through Christ Jesus. For by
[2:25:32] grace I saved through faith
[2:25:35] and that's not of yourself.
[2:25:38] It is the gift of God,
[2:25:42] not of work, least any man should boss.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Now, so you see, I think that's the
[2:25:50] thing that tricks our mind
[2:25:53] because Paul says, "So, so so, so no man
[2:25:56] can boast." So, we think that we are
[2:25:58] humble if we say, "I'm a sinner saved by
[2:26:01] grace." That's not what he said.
[2:26:04] That's not what he said.
[2:26:07] Praise the Lord.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not what the Apostle Paul
[2:26:11] said.
[2:26:14] He don't want for us to boast in
[2:26:16] ourself.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; We don't have nothing of oursel to brag
[2:26:20] in
[2:26:21] but to trust in his grace.
[2:26:32] We want to play that song. I also sing
[2:26:37] by grace.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:06] Now I lay and breathe in freedom.
[2:27:11] with each breath of life by
[2:27:16] walk and for
[2:27:22] that.
[2:27:28] I was a sing
[2:27:34] by.
[2:27:38] Oh
[2:27:42] Jesus,
[2:27:45] save by grace.
[2:27:51] When I saw
[2:27:58] my place,
[2:28:03] now I live and bring the freedom
[2:28:09] for each breath of
[2:28:14] love and for
[2:28:25] I was a sinner
[2:28:31] by
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads down. Heavenly

[2:42:06] my head
[2:42:11] on Calary
[2:42:14] night
[2:42:15] to redeem his lost bride.

[2:43:25] Yes. Who I am, Lord.
[2:43:29] Oh, who I am.
[2:43:34] I can see now
[2:43:38] just who I am.
[2:43:42] I'm a part of my Savior.
[2:43:46] I'm a part of this world.
[2:43:50] It's a revelation
[2:43:55] predestination
[2:43:59] of who I am.
[2:44:03] Oh, who I am.
[2:44:08] Who I am.
[2:44:11] Oh, I can see now
[2:44:16] just who I am.
[2:44:20] I'm a part of my savior.
[2:44:24] I'm a part of his world.
[2:44:28] What a revelation
[2:44:33] predestination.
[2:44:37] Oh my.
[2:44:42] The Lord bless you. Let's go in the
[2:44:45] peace of the Lord.
