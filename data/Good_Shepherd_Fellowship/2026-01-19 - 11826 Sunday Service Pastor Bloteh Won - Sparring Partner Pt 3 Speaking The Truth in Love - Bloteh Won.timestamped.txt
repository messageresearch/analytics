[54:29] that
[54:32] the soul of Jonathan was not with the
[54:35] soul of David.
[54:37] And Jonathan love him as his own soul.
[54:41] And Saul took him that day and will
[54:45] and will let uh him go no more home to
[54:49] his father's house. Then Jonathan and
[54:53] David made a covenant because he loved
[54:56] him as his own soul.
[54:59] And uh Jonathan stripped himself of the
[55:01] ro that was upon him and gave it to

[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; So, we read a portion of our scripture
[1:03:23] and u we've been speaking on spiring
[1:03:25] partners. We want to see how we can
[1:03:28] bring that uh uh talk to an end this
[1:03:30] morning. Um
[1:03:34] we want to see if we can bring that
[1:03:36] thought to an end. Thank you, brother
[1:03:37] Dan, for for reminding me. Uh so all all
[1:03:41] our little ones, you can go back there.
[1:03:44] Uh uh
[1:03:47] all our little ones, you can go back
[1:03:49] there. Our
[1:03:52] Sunday school ones and then uh uh one of
[1:03:57] one of the sisters working to go back
[1:03:59] there. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:03] Amen.
[1:04:07] the little ones are enjoying it. So why
[1:04:09] not? Let's give it to them. Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Let's give it to them.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; So uh uh we like I said, we want to see
[1:04:17] how we can trust the Lord to to uh close
[1:04:22] this subject
[1:04:24] aspiring partners. But I kind of titled
[1:04:27] it this morning speaking the truth in
[1:04:29] love. And uh uh
[1:04:34] there's a that I wanted to get to with
[1:04:37] this thinking and um I don't know if uh
[1:04:43] uh it's not the right time or or
[1:04:46] whatever it is, but I'm going to I'm
[1:04:48] going to do my best this morning and
[1:04:50] take another route here. Uh so the
[1:04:53] scripture that we read was uh actually
[1:04:56] uh pointing to the friendship that was
[1:04:58] between uh Jon and David.
[1:05:03] And we we use We talked about uh uh
[1:05:07] Barnabas and Saul last week uh showing
[1:05:10] an aspect of uh aspiring partners. This
[1:05:13] morning we want to take uh uh Jonathan
[1:05:16] and David and uh we just we just want to
[1:05:19] use them as a type of uh of uh uh men
[1:05:24] that God brought together. And and in
[1:05:27] the way with the story of Jonathan and
[1:05:29] David, you can see that uh uh uh
[1:05:32] Jonathan was uh the one to be to to
[1:05:36] inherit the throne after his father uh
[1:05:39] uh Saul. But when he recognized the gift
[1:05:44] of God in the life of David, when he
[1:05:46] recognized what God was doing in David,
[1:05:49] he was willing to somehow
[1:05:54] uh uh surrender that office. He was
[1:05:56] willing to protect David. He was willing
[1:05:59] to fight for David even against his own
[1:06:02] father. Praise the Lord. So the
[1:06:05] scripture we read it speaks about uh uh
[1:06:09] uh journey turn and David that is just
[1:06:11] after 1st Samuel chapter 17 that speaks
[1:06:14] about the wall between David and
[1:06:16] Goliath. So journey turn watching a
[1:06:19] young man whether David was younger than
[1:06:22] him or or he was younger than David but
[1:06:25] they might have been age group they
[1:06:27] might have been youth and just to see
[1:06:30] the courage that a young man had to be
[1:06:33] able to stand against the giant that
[1:06:36] terrify uh the the not only the armed of
[1:06:40] Israel but the people of Israel. Praise
[1:06:42] the Lord. just to be able to see such a
[1:06:45] courage that David had and uh uh he uh
[1:06:49] he he thought that there is something
[1:06:51] about this guy. Amen. There is something
[1:06:54] about this guy and the Bible say he
[1:06:57] loved David as his own soul. Amen. He he
[1:07:00] loved David with everything that was
[1:07:02] that is within. So when you read uh uh
[1:07:05] chapter
[1:07:06] uh um you read chapter
[1:07:10] 18 uh it talks about that relationship
[1:07:13] you get over in chapter 20 let's look at
[1:07:16] chapter 20 verse4 and the bible will
[1:07:20] speak here then said jaton unto David
[1:07:22] whatsoever that thy soul desire I will
[1:07:26] even do it unto I will even do it for
[1:07:29] thee and David said unto jaton behold
[1:07:32] tomorrow It is the new moon and I shall
[1:07:36] not fail to sit with the king
[1:07:41] to sit with the king at meat. But let me
[1:07:44] go that I may hide myself in the field
[1:07:49] onto the onto the third day at evening.
[1:07:52] Now you have to realize now David is
[1:07:55] doing this because couple of times Saul
[1:07:58] has used javelin to to to hit at David.
[1:08:03] Now so they are going to to have this
[1:08:05] feast. They will be sitting in the room
[1:08:07] the family by themsel David in his mind
[1:08:10] thinking that Saul could kill him right
[1:08:13] there and nothing will come from out of
[1:08:14] it.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:17] He was thinking in his mind, this is a
[1:08:19] very close range.
[1:08:22] I'm going to be right there. He's going
[1:08:24] to be there. So well, he advised himself
[1:08:26] to go away. And now he's telling
[1:08:28] Jonathan near verse six, if the father
[1:08:32] had all missed me, then said David
[1:08:34] earnestly asks, "Leave of me that he
[1:08:37] might run to Bethlehem, his city, for
[1:08:39] there is a yearly sacrifice there for
[1:08:42] all the family. If he said thus, it is
[1:08:46] well that seven shall have peace. But if
[1:08:50] if
[1:08:52] he be very rough, then be sure that evil
[1:08:57] is determined by him. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:02] Therefore
[1:09:03] uh uh thou shalt deal kindly with thy
[1:09:06] servant. For thou hast brought thy
[1:09:08] servant into a covenant of the Lord with
[1:09:11] thee, notwithstanding, if there be in me
[1:09:15] iniquity, slay me thyself, for thou
[1:09:20] shouldest thou bring me to thy father.
[1:09:22] Now, so David is saying all of this to
[1:09:25] him. Jonathan can't believe it that his
[1:09:28] father will ever be thinking to do any
[1:09:30] evil to this man that have never done
[1:09:32] anything. This man that has brought
[1:09:34] proud upon the nation. He just can't
[1:09:37] believe it. So now they setting all of
[1:09:39] this up and then uh let's drop a little
[1:09:41] bit down to verse 25
[1:09:45] just to cover our jun and uh
[1:09:48] and David's story yet a little bit.
[1:09:53] Verse 25.
[1:09:59] Verse 24. So David hid himself in the
[1:10:02] field. And when the new moon was come,
[1:10:04] the king sat
[1:10:07] the king sat him down to eat meal, and
[1:10:10] the king sat upon his his seat as at all
[1:10:14] times, even upon the seat by the wall.
[1:10:19] and Jonathan the rose and Abnad uh uh
[1:10:22] sat by Saul's side and David place was
[1:10:25] empty. Nevertheless, Saul speak
[1:10:28] not anything
[1:10:30] that day, for he thought uh something
[1:10:34] had befallen him. He is not clean.
[1:10:38] Surely he is not clean. Talking about
[1:10:41] David now. And it came to pass on the
[1:10:43] tomorrow which was the second day of the
[1:10:46] month and and David place was emptied.
[1:10:48] And Saul said unto Jonathan his son,
[1:10:50] where wherefore cometh not the son of
[1:10:54] Jesse to meet me yesterday not today?
[1:10:57] And Jonathan answered Saul David
[1:11:00] earnestly asked me ask leave of me to go
[1:11:03] to Bethlehem just like they planned to
[1:11:06] say. And he said, "Let me go, I pray
[1:11:09] thee, for our family have a sacrifice in
[1:11:12] the city, and uh my brothers,
[1:11:17] he have commanded me to be there." And
[1:11:19] now, if I have found favor in thy eyes,
[1:11:22] let me get away, I pray thee, and see my
[1:11:25] brethren. Therefore, he cometh not unto
[1:11:28] the king's temple. And saw then saw
[1:11:32] anger was counted against journey and he
[1:11:34] said unto him, "Thou son of a perverse,
[1:11:38] rebellious woman." Praise the Lord.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Uh do not I know that thou has chosen
[1:11:46] the son of Jesse
[1:11:49] to thine own confusion
[1:11:52] and onto the confusion of thy mother's
[1:11:56] nakedness. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. in in is is a kind of a ugly
[1:12:02] expression. is an insult and uh uh but
[1:12:05] but you you can see the picture here now
[1:12:08] uh uh uh Jonathan has really proven you
[1:12:12] know what David told him that there is
[1:12:14] there is evil in the heart of Saul you
[1:12:17] know he want to kill this boy so now uh
[1:12:20] Jonathan can't believe it that his dad
[1:12:22] is is just full of rage and evil like
[1:12:25] that just to hear that David gone to
[1:12:28] greet his people now then and we know
[1:12:30] that the rest of the story Uh they have
[1:12:33] planned that Jon will shoot an arrow to
[1:12:35] announce that do not come back here. You
[1:12:38] know he says if I shoot the arrow on the
[1:12:40] right and send the young man to pick up
[1:12:42] the arrow then you should come. If I
[1:12:44] shoot it on the left far above you, it
[1:12:47] means that you should flee. Praise the
[1:12:49] Lord. So u uh uh uh uh the thing here is
[1:12:55] that the picture we want to look at here
[1:12:57] is is God bringing these two men
[1:13:00] together. And uh uh because David was
[1:13:05] the one that was anointed to be king as
[1:13:09] we as we know there from the time of
[1:13:11] Judah. If you if you go back uh to Ruth
[1:13:15] and you go back to the history uh when
[1:13:18] when when when uh Jacob prophesied the
[1:13:21] scepter will come out of Judah, we know
[1:13:24] that it was a promise of a kingship in
[1:13:26] Israel. So right from that time uh uh uh
[1:13:30] David is the one that is fulfilling that
[1:13:33] kingship because Israel had never had a
[1:13:35] king. The king was supposed to come from
[1:13:37] out of the heart of Judah, not out of
[1:13:40] the house of Benjamin. Saul was out of
[1:13:42] the house of Benjamin. So he was out of
[1:13:44] place. He was he was a permitted king.
[1:13:47] He was in the permissive word of God.
[1:13:50] That's the reason why he he could fail.
[1:13:52] He could never prosper because he was in
[1:13:54] the permissive word of God. The king was
[1:13:56] supposed to come from out of the house
[1:13:58] of Judah. Now Samuel came and anointed
[1:14:01] David to be king. So we see everything
[1:14:04] playing out here. But yet God has raised
[1:14:06] up a man in the house of Saul to be able
[1:14:10] to protect David to get to the kingship.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; So you see in this in this partnership,
[1:14:20] it's all about God's purpose.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; It's not about our greed and our
[1:14:25] selfishness and what we want. It's all
[1:14:27] about God's purpose.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Last week we look at
[1:14:34] Paul and Barnabas. Barnabas was the one
[1:14:37] that went and got Paul and brought Paul
[1:14:40] and the bread the brethren. Amen.
[1:14:42] Introduced Paul over to the apostles and
[1:14:45] talk about Paul. But when it came to the
[1:14:47] place where Paul felt that uh h was not
[1:14:52] you know he was not he was not mature or
[1:14:54] he was not ready for the job you know he
[1:14:57] and Barnabas fall apart. But the picture
[1:15:00] in that also is not their argument and
[1:15:03] their disagreement. God allowed that so
[1:15:06] Paul can fully go into his ministry
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; to become the chief apostle
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; to become the prophet to the Gentiles.
[1:15:16] Because as long as he was with Barnabas,
[1:15:18] Barnabas will always overshadow him
[1:15:21] because Barnaba was the one that brought
[1:15:23] him in.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Okay? So God allowed a little
[1:15:28] misunderstanding there and we saw that
[1:15:31] uh Paul when he took uh Silas with him
[1:15:35] he was able to get Timothy get Titus
[1:15:38] ordained this man and Paul was right
[1:15:40] into his ministry. At the end of his
[1:15:43] ministry he sent for Mark
[1:15:46] the very same John Mark.
[1:15:49] Okay, sure.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; He sent for him and says, "Bring back
[1:15:52] unto me, he will be much profitable."
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; So you see God's ways upon it past funny
[1:15:58] that
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; this whole thing is God's program
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; and we have to watch it and see it that
[1:16:05] way.
[1:16:06] Even the way that he brings us together
[1:16:09] as a church, the way he brings us
[1:16:11] together as a family,
[1:16:15] I must never get to the place and feel
[1:16:17] that well yeah, you know, I went down to
[1:16:19] this place and I choose this woman to be
[1:16:21] my wife. It was my choosing, you know,
[1:16:23] and and you have to see there it is
[1:16:26] God's design.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And if it is God's design, God has a
[1:16:34] purpose.
[1:16:37] And it is only the things that serve
[1:16:39] God's purpose, his promise, a
[1:16:41] resurrection.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; So this whole thing about partnership is
[1:16:48] tied to redemption. It's tied to God's
[1:16:52] plan of redemption.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; It's tied to God plan of redemption.
[1:17:03] Are we together?
[1:17:05] Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Let's let's look in uh uh u
[1:17:16] Ephesians chapter 4. That will have been
[1:17:19] our our second scripture reading. But
[1:17:22] since the baby dedication became part of
[1:17:25] the preaching, we are going right ahead.
[1:17:28] Amen. We are going right ahead. Oh my
[1:17:31] goodness me.
[1:17:36] I was glad that I I caught myself
[1:17:40] even if I would have started preaching
[1:17:42] and remember I was going to stop
[1:17:43] preaching and dedicate the baby because
[1:17:45] I know they are tough. The girls
[1:17:47] wouldn't have spared me to the house.
[1:17:50] Amen.
[1:17:52] If I would have just continued.
[1:17:55] Ephesians chapter 4.
[1:17:58] Praise the Lord. Ephesians chapter 4.
[1:18:01] Let's look at this also. We see here in
[1:18:04] verse uh 11, the Bible says he gave he
[1:18:08] he gives some apostles and some prophets
[1:18:11] and some evangelists and some pastors
[1:18:14] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:18:16] saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:18:19] the edifiring of uh the body of Christ.
[1:18:23] Till we all can come come in the unity
[1:18:27] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:18:29] son of God unto a perfect man onto the
[1:18:33] measure
[1:18:35] of the statue of the fullness of Christ.
[1:18:39] There. Henceforth we be no more children
[1:18:42] toes toe and for and carried about with
[1:18:45] every wings of doctrine by by the by the
[1:18:48] sides of men and a cony craftiness
[1:18:51] whereby the delight in which to deceive.
[1:18:55] But speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:18:59] up
[1:19:01] into him uh in all things which is the
[1:19:05] head even Christ. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:09] yesterday that as as I was thinking
[1:19:11] about this I was uh uh there was
[1:19:13] something
[1:19:15] I felt strong to go into but then at the
[1:19:18] end of the day that I just said no maybe
[1:19:21] I might talk about it uh another time
[1:19:25] you know uh with with everything that is
[1:19:28] happening around the country and around
[1:19:31] the world
[1:19:33] uh as as as Christians as Bible
[1:19:36] believers
[1:19:37] you know we listen to the news and then
[1:19:40] we also look into prophecy. So I started
[1:19:44] looking through the message and trying
[1:19:45] to find what brother Brandham said about
[1:19:47] Greenland
[1:19:49] and I saw some very interesting quote
[1:19:51] you can check it up yourself is is
[1:19:53] something that is open to to the to the
[1:19:56] public domain. You can search it out. I
[1:19:58] saw some interesting thing that Brother
[1:20:00] Brandham said about Greenland and uh but
[1:20:04] then looking into that and and and
[1:20:07] reading what brother Brandham said and
[1:20:08] also searching out history,
[1:20:13] a uh it brought me to a place where I
[1:20:16] will have talked about uh uh
[1:20:22] some things that have to do with the
[1:20:24] with the economy and different things,
[1:20:27] but I just thought that well I mean we
[1:20:29] we we just have we we we already have
[1:20:32] this kind of ugly cloud hanging over us
[1:20:35] in Minneapolis that is that is you know
[1:20:38] that is easy to make people to be
[1:20:40] panicking and uh so let me not let me
[1:20:44] not quote talking about people finance
[1:20:46] and all of that let me leave that one
[1:20:48] for now maybe another time we will look
[1:20:50] into it
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; but it was very interesting you know
[1:20:54] just like just like I say all the time
[1:20:57] any you know we will always say that uh
[1:20:59] we don't we don't believe in in uh you
[1:21:02] know Bible schools we don't go to Bible
[1:21:04] school but I would tell you that the
[1:21:06] message of the hour is one of the
[1:21:10] greatest uh uh document that is search
[1:21:13] and search can you imagine how many
[1:21:15] preachers search the message of the hour
[1:21:17] every week
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; to be able to find something to preach
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; and and and and for many of us uh uh uh
[1:21:28] years back uh you know uh believing the
[1:21:30] message in the time of war the message
[1:21:33] of the hour was a very it was a very
[1:21:36] great source of education to us
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; you know every everything uh you know
[1:21:42] unless I don't think about it that way
[1:21:45] but when it catch my mind I try to look
[1:21:47] to see what a prophet has said about it
[1:21:50] so maybe sometime we will we will look
[1:21:52] at it but it was very interesting to see
[1:21:55] that how global politics is playing.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; And sometimes uh uh uh
[1:22:04] even the people that are championing all
[1:22:06] of these politics don't know the things
[1:22:08] that they are playing with.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Like I always say, prophecy is stronger
[1:22:12] than politics.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; And as children of God, let's realize
[1:22:17] prophecy is what is driving this thing.
[1:22:21] And if you believe God and you believe
[1:22:23] the uh God's word, then you must rest on
[1:22:26] that
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; and don't rest on the politics
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; because prophecy is what driving what we
[1:22:32] have happen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; It's around the word. Everything is
[1:22:39] driven by prophecy.
[1:22:41] So uh uh that's not what we're looking
[1:22:43] at this morning. So let's go back here
[1:22:46] now. So we see that God uh has ordained
[1:22:49] a five-fold ministry. God has ordained a
[1:22:52] five-fold ministry. Men that uh that he
[1:22:55] called and he gave gifts just like Jesus
[1:22:58] had 12 disciples. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; He has 12 men that he drew closer to
[1:23:03] him. There were 17. Out of the 17, he
[1:23:06] drew 12 that he he he the scripture
[1:23:09] called disciples that he taught them a
[1:23:12] little bit. Mark chapter 6. Let's let's
[1:23:14] just look at how how Mac uh uh speaks of
[1:23:20] them here a little bit. Mark chapter 6.
[1:23:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:34] Mark chapter 6
[1:23:36] and and and again uh just uh just uh for
[1:23:40] our information this book of Mark Mark
[1:23:42] was never a disciple. He was not a
[1:23:45] disciple. He was not among the 12. This
[1:23:48] is the very same John Mark.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; The very same John Mark. He he's writing
[1:23:54] this
[1:23:56] and scholars believe that this is
[1:23:58] Peter's account of the gospel.
[1:24:03] But Mark wrote it. That's what many
[1:24:05] scholars believe.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; So this is the very same John Mark, you
[1:24:10] know, he's uh left his mother house and
[1:24:13] followed Banner and and and Gary said
[1:24:15] he's he has grown to the place to be
[1:24:17] able to give us an account that we can
[1:24:20] rely on this morning. So Mark chapter 6,
[1:24:23] let's read from verse 7.
[1:24:26] Mark chapter 6 from verse 7.
[1:24:29] Jesus has come back to his own city and
[1:24:33] uh and and and when he came back there
[1:24:35] there was there were just a whole lot of
[1:24:37] things that the people had to say about
[1:24:39] him you know where he make that
[1:24:42] statement a prophet is not without honor
[1:24:45] but in his own country and among his own
[1:24:47] kings and in his own house. Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But uh verse seven will
[1:24:53] tell us that and he called them and he
[1:24:57] called unto him the 12 and began to send
[1:25:01] them forth two
[1:25:04] and two
[1:25:06] and gave them power over unclean spirit.
[1:25:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[1:25:14] according to the according to the
[1:25:15] scripture over in the book of
[1:25:17] Deuteronomy the Bible says uh uh uh uh
[1:25:20] on any matter you can only accept uh the
[1:25:24] witness of two.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; So two has always been the number of a
[1:25:28] witness. You just can't accept only one
[1:25:31] person. You have to have another person
[1:25:33] that witness the same thing in the mouth
[1:25:35] of two or three. That's where that came
[1:25:37] from. Amen. Let everything be
[1:25:39] established. So we see here that Jesus
[1:25:42] is also carrying this principle out in
[1:25:45] the way that he sent out his disciples.
[1:25:48] He sent them out two and two. Praise the
[1:25:51] Lord.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Solomon,
[1:25:55] brother Solomon,
[1:25:57] the great uh the great uh mind of wisdom
[1:26:01] in Ecclesiastes chapter 7, he also said
[1:26:04] this. Let's read it together.
[1:26:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Uh, chapter 4, sorry. Ecclesiastes
[1:26:20] chapter 4.
[1:26:26] From chapter 3, Solomon will start to
[1:26:28] talk about how everything under the
[1:26:30] earth, there's a time for everything
[1:26:31] under the earth. In chapter 4, he will
[1:26:34] go and uh and start looking at uh uh uh
[1:26:38] governmental stuff, how how things were
[1:26:40] wrong by the Lord and how people were
[1:26:43] oppressed and and you know and all of
[1:26:45] that. He's looking at it. But then when
[1:26:47] he comes down here, Solomon would pick
[1:26:49] up four men. You would talk about four
[1:26:52] kind of a man. You would talk about uh
[1:26:56] uh uh
[1:27:01] uh
[1:27:04] verse four again. I consider a travel
[1:27:07] that that uh that every right work that
[1:27:11] that for this man is envy and and his
[1:27:16] neighbor this is vited investigation of
[1:27:18] spirit. He would talks about the food.
[1:27:20] He would talks about the independent
[1:27:22] man. He would talks also about the
[1:27:25] industrial man and uh and and on and on.
[1:27:29] But as he speaks of them, he will come
[1:27:31] to this this other line of conclusion
[1:27:44] which is in verse 8.
[1:27:46] That's the conclusion he talks when he
[1:27:48] talks about the independent man. He said
[1:27:50] there is one alone. That's the
[1:27:52] independent man. He's alone. And there
[1:27:54] is not a second.
[1:27:57] Yet yet he had neither child nor
[1:28:01] brother.
[1:28:02] Yet is there no end of all his labor.
[1:28:06] Neither is his eyes satisfied with
[1:28:10] riches.
[1:28:13] Neither said he, for whom do I labor?
[1:28:18] and believe his soul of good. This is
[1:28:22] also vanity yet it is a soul of travel.
[1:28:26] He's an independent man. He's working.
[1:28:28] He get all of his wealth yet he don't
[1:28:30] have anybody to pass it down to. So from
[1:28:33] that Solomon will come up with this
[1:28:36] statement that we all are familiar with.
[1:28:39] Verse nine, two are better than one.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Two are better than one because
[1:28:52] they have a good reward for their labor.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; They have a good reward. It is not more
[1:29:00] in the substance of what they gather,
[1:29:03] but the way they reward one another.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Two is better than one because they
[1:29:10] learn to reward one another. Because I'm
[1:29:14] telling you, if if they just only gather
[1:29:16] reward separate for themsel, they will
[1:29:19] kill themselves over that reward
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; with the unconverted nature of men.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; But when two men works together and they
[1:29:28] learn to reward one another,
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; They learn to to to look for the
[1:29:37] progress and and the advancement of one
[1:29:39] another.
[1:29:41] That's what he that what he means. They
[1:29:44] have good reward for their labor. For if
[1:29:48] they fail, the one will lift up his
[1:29:51] fellow.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; But woe unto him that is alone when he
[1:29:57] when he fall
[1:29:59] for he have not another to help him up.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; He don't have a sparing partner.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Somewhere he's greeted.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. In some way he's greeted in some
[1:30:11] way life throw that at him. But in in
[1:30:15] whatever way that life throw it at us.
[1:30:17] Again
[1:30:18] if uh two lie together then they have
[1:30:23] heat.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; But how can one be warm alone?
[1:30:29] And if one prevail against him, two
[1:30:33] shall withstain him and a threefold call
[1:30:38] is not quickly broken. I read that for
[1:30:40] the purpose.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; The reason why I read that, the purpose
[1:30:43] that I read for is because in most cases
[1:30:46] that is tied. It's it's normally read
[1:30:49] during our marriage ceremony.
[1:30:52] But just like I said on the first day,
[1:30:54] you you will realize that uh uh uh God
[1:30:59] internal laws and press and principle.
[1:31:03] We we sometimes try in our human mind to
[1:31:06] understand it. There are so much we
[1:31:09] reduce it to our canality and
[1:31:14] perversion.
[1:31:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God's intents behind us is
[1:31:24] more than just our fleshly desire.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Because there there are many that are
[1:31:35] not married. They still living. They are
[1:31:36] not dead yet.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. They have not frozen to death.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; So in as much as we can we can read it,
[1:31:49] you know, and and encourage couples, we
[1:31:51] can read it and encourage people and
[1:31:53] say, "Well, get married. The Bible says
[1:31:54] that." But you cannot
[1:31:57] reduce that.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; to that alone. And and that is and that
[1:32:06] is some of the things that I really want
[1:32:08] to get to here. That is some of the
[1:32:10] things that I want to get to. And as we
[1:32:13] look into this sparring partners, hope
[1:32:16] that I can be able to finish it today.
[1:32:21] I will ask one question.
[1:32:24] What is our principal responsibility
[1:32:28] as humans,
[1:32:30] as creatures of God? What is our
[1:32:34] principle
[1:32:36] responsibility?
[1:32:38] I believe our principal responsibility,
[1:32:42] our purpose of being alive is to glorify
[1:32:46] the father.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Uh the the the principle reason why God
[1:32:54] made everything
[1:32:56] like like David was said, the heavens
[1:32:59] declare the glory of God.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; It glorify God.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; The snow that is falling glorify God. We
[1:33:09] don't like it. God like it. He made it
[1:33:11] for it to for it to glorify him.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; So the principle reason why we were made
[1:33:20] is to glorify the father.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; If we miss that we miss our purpose of
[1:33:27] life.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Every other things can be our
[1:33:33] achievement. We achieved this, we
[1:33:36] achieved that. But what is the purpose?
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; What is our principle responsibility?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus will say in St. John 15:8, he
[1:33:53] says, "Yay in is my father glorified
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; that ye bear much fruit."
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] So if if if if if our purpose is to
[1:34:08] glorify the father, then we must be able
[1:34:12] to bring forth those fruits.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; We must be able to bring forth those
[1:34:20] fruits that will glorify
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; the father.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Are you are you grabbing my my
[1:34:31] line of thoughts here? Amen. Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Because we've been looking at this
[1:34:38] subject. The purpose of redemption uh h
[1:34:42] or the work of redemption is is
[1:34:44] partnership.
[1:34:46] Last last uh uh Sunday we talked read a
[1:34:50] quote where brother Brandham says uh you
[1:34:52] know uh Satan was was a co-artner to God
[1:34:56] and we show his co-artnership
[1:34:59] because there is no evil. evil do not
[1:35:02] proceed out of God. So God has to make a
[1:35:05] creature that will be responsible for
[1:35:07] for for evil. So in that way he was he
[1:35:11] was made a partner with God because the
[1:35:14] evil that will proceed out of him will
[1:35:16] bring out God's attribute.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Just like your tool, your tool is your
[1:35:25] partner to get the job done.
[1:35:28] You have the knowledge, but if you don't
[1:35:29] have the stru the the boat is not going
[1:35:32] to come out,
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; So the the the the the wrench or
[1:35:37] whatever tools you are using become a
[1:35:40] partner for you to get the boat done.
[1:35:43] But when that work is done, you throw
[1:35:46] that partner down. You have brother
[1:35:49] Johnny that is helping you and he's a
[1:35:52] partner that you can travel with. You
[1:35:54] only knew need is true for that job done
[1:35:57] but you need brother Johnny for your to
[1:35:59] be able to go along with. So on this
[1:36:01] side God has his attribute. He has his
[1:36:05] children as his partner. On this other
[1:36:08] side he has the devil that is a tool
[1:36:11] just a partner to use in in in in
[1:36:14] certain situation. He will throw him
[1:36:16] down for but for you and myself is
[1:36:18] eternity. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Our partnership we go along with the
[1:36:23] father through eternity.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; So we were looking at that. It is in
[1:36:27] that sense that brother Brandon call him
[1:36:29] a co-artner.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; I would tell you truth. I was listening
[1:36:38] to this message that we going to read
[1:36:41] now one of the morning uh uh while I was
[1:36:45] there in South Africa. That's that's
[1:36:47] what brought me into this whole partner
[1:36:49] thing here.
[1:36:51] And I was listening to this message,
[1:36:53] super sign. Brother Brandham said this
[1:36:57] and and it really blessed me that
[1:36:59] morning. I I I remember reading it to to
[1:37:02] the congregation there in South Africa.
[1:37:04] Listen to this. He said, "But Abraham,
[1:37:07] if you can catch it, praise the Lord."
[1:37:10] Are you ready to catch it?
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; You have your gloves on. Yeah.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; And are you in position?
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; A catcher got to position himself
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; to really catch.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't position yourself, you
[1:37:28] fall over your head. Now he says if you
[1:37:31] can catch it,
[1:37:33] he have faith in God. Abraham have faith
[1:37:37] in God. Listen to this.
[1:37:40] which united
[1:37:42] the spirit of God with his flesh.
[1:37:47] Abraham faith in God
[1:37:50] united the spirit of God with his body.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Your faith in God
[1:38:02] unites you
[1:38:04] with the spirit of God
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; and then it has effect and then your
[1:38:10] body express it.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance of thing hoped
[1:38:21] for.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Faith, can you believe it? That is the
[1:38:28] only thing that we have to go to heaven.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; The only thing we have for a
[1:38:36] resurrection is faith.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Show it to me. You can't do it visibly.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot do it visibly.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; But you believe it.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, I believe it so so
[1:38:56] well this morning that I hang my life on
[1:38:59] it that if I drop dead here this
[1:39:01] morning, in the next minute I'll be in a
[1:39:03] brand new body.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, you believe it. That's the
[1:39:08] reason why you live for it.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why YOU TIE THE
[1:39:12] PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE TO it because you
[1:39:14] believe it.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; So, see what he's saying.
[1:39:23] Your faith,
[1:39:25] your faith in God
[1:39:29] unite with the spirit of God
[1:39:37] or it unite the spirit of God with your
[1:39:41] flesh. Let's let's read on a little bit
[1:39:44] here. Amen. There is where the faith
[1:39:48] comes.
[1:39:50] That is why he
[1:39:53] he could be
[1:39:55] the Abraham seed. Not all flesh,
[1:39:59] but their uniting of the spirit and the
[1:40:03] flesh together.
[1:40:07] The uniting of the spirit and the flesh
[1:40:11] together. And what do what do that
[1:40:13] uniting? What does it
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; your faith?
[1:40:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; That's what your faith does.
[1:40:26] As you hear the word of God, as you hear
[1:40:28] the promise of God,
[1:40:32] faith is built in you. And what it does
[1:40:35] is that a a a a it create an avenue for
[1:40:39] the spirit of God to bring that promise
[1:40:42] of God to pass in your flesh.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is not it is not reasoning.
[1:40:51] It's not just mental conception.
[1:40:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:59] No, it's not just mental conception.
[1:41:01] It's not it's not it's not being
[1:41:03] intellectual either.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just I just pray that this can
[1:41:14] become real to you. I can stop right
[1:41:16] here, spend the rest of the morning
[1:41:18] here, and then uh and then we can go
[1:41:20] home.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Because this is this is where our
[1:41:27] Christian faith, all of the things that
[1:41:29] we are doing, believing God, believing
[1:41:32] in his promises, looking for the
[1:41:33] supernatural, wanting God to work on our
[1:41:36] behalf, wanting God to make himself
[1:41:39] known. This is the way it happens.
[1:41:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Your faith in God will unite the spirit
[1:41:51] of God with your flesh.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; It's not you practicing to be good.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; It's not you practicing to be holy.
[1:42:02] That's the same thing with divine
[1:42:04] healing. Your faith in God
[1:42:07] is going to unite YOUR BODY WITH THE
[1:42:10] PROMISE of God and wake it out of
[1:42:12] sickness.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Oh man.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe another preacher can come
[1:42:23] and tag me up and preach this thing
[1:42:24] better and and then just run it home.
[1:42:28] Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:31] There is why he could be the the the
[1:42:34] being.
[1:42:36] But Abraham see not all flesh but the
[1:42:39] uniting of the spirit and the flesh
[1:42:42] together. God, man.
[1:42:46] God making himself tearing out, rooting
[1:42:50] out all evil, bringing into summation
[1:42:56] the flesh,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; the dust that he created, this dust,
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; rooting out all evil.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Evil desire, evil thought,
[1:43:15] How is he doing it? He's using your
[1:43:17] faith.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus would say, "Be it unto
[1:43:21] you I calling to your faith."
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; LET YOUR FAITH OPERATE THE WORD OF GOD
[1:43:26] IN your body.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; LET YOUR FAITH OPERATE. Oh my god. I'm
[1:43:40] trying to see how I can how I can how I
[1:43:43] can preach this thing. Lord, help me
[1:43:44] this morning.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT'S THE CHRISTIAN LIFE.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; That's the Christian life.
[1:44:01] That is the thing that is HAPPENING TO
[1:44:03] US EVERY DAY.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we play down on the word of
[1:44:10] God, there is no way THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:44:13] WILL UNITE WITH THAT.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; When we take the word of God not to be
[1:44:19] real, not to be present, not to be true,
[1:44:22] THERE IS NO WAY that the spirit of God
[1:44:24] will will unite to death. Listening to
[1:44:25] brother Brand this morning, coming to
[1:44:27] church, a a spirit of truth. And he's
[1:44:30] talking about how uh he told those
[1:44:32] brothers there, there's going to be a
[1:44:34] carbo there on the hill. He's going to
[1:44:37] get a a a a grace band and all of that s
[1:44:41] and and and the brother is telling him,
[1:44:43] "Look, I have haunted on THIS MOUNTAIN
[1:44:45] ALL OF MY LIFE. I HAVE NEVER seen
[1:44:47] anything." He said, "But God told me."
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Now, are you GOING TO JUST DWELL on what
[1:44:57] you know?

[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. than letting go what you know AND
[1:45:04] ALLOWING THE SPIRIT OF GOD TO UNITE WITH
[1:45:07] YOU. TAKING GOD'S WORD THAT GOD is more
[1:45:11] than able.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Oh
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; man.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Oh man. When we talk about this
[1:45:24] partnership, it looks like we are trying
[1:45:26] to recruit members for good sheeperd
[1:45:28] fellowship, but that's not exactly what
[1:45:30] it is. What it is is that God is the one
[1:45:33] that is recruiting his people that will
[1:45:36] be able to stand for him in this day.
[1:45:38] People that will believe the WORD OF
[1:45:40] GOD, THAT'S PART OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
[1:45:41] around their life.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; And they will hold to God's word.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; When the prophet of God says your body
[1:45:56] will obey your confession,
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; that's what he's talking about.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; When your faith can hold to God's word,
[1:46:02] UNTIL YOUR BODY obey your confession,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; because your your body is confessing
[1:46:09] what God's word says.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; I feel like reading it again. Thank you.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Do it.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel like reading it again. I was
[1:46:25] just I was just I just I just relied on
[1:46:28] this one code for the rest of the
[1:46:30] meeting. And and I just thank the Lord
[1:46:33] that he just he he I was pressing my
[1:46:35] clothes and trying to get myself ready
[1:46:37] and just listening. And brother Brandham
[1:46:39] said I said, "What did he says? My faith
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; unite with the spirit of God."
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; No, no. Let let me go back and see what
[1:46:50] he said. Praise the Lord.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. It changed my life. It
[1:46:55] really affected my life.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; It really affected my life. If you can
[1:47:00] catch it, he have faith in God
[1:47:04] which united the spirit of God with with
[1:47:07] with the flesh of man. There is where
[1:47:11] faith comes. The faith comes. There is
[1:47:14] why he could be the seed of Abraham. Not
[1:47:18] all flesh, but the uniting
[1:47:22] of spirit and flesh together. God making
[1:47:26] himself tearing out, rooting out all
[1:47:30] evil, bringing into subjuggestion the
[1:47:33] flesh, the dust that he created. The
[1:47:36] flesh which is the dust that he created
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; and live with you as a partner.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; That's how God get his partners
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; in all the ages. That's how he his
[1:47:50] partners is not church membership. His
[1:47:54] partner is not how many years you've
[1:47:55] been in the message.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; His partner is when he can be able to
[1:48:01] unite your faith with his with his word,
[1:48:03] with his spirit AND BRING YOUR BODY ON A
[1:48:06] SUBJECTION.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; That's how he gets his partners.
[1:48:21] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say Lord, make me your partner.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, make me your partner, Lord.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Let let let my let my let my faith Lord
[1:48:33] unite, oh God, with your spirit
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; that it can bring the desires of my
[1:48:39] flesh on a subjuggestion. Amen.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; That it can bring my mind and all the
[1:48:44] negativity, all the negative energy in
[1:48:46] me. Yes,
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; he can bring it under suggestion.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Make me your partner. That's the kind of
[1:48:51] a partnership we're talking about.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of a partnership we're
[1:48:58] talking about. Oh my.
[1:49:01] Oh, glory be to God.
[1:49:06] Amen.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we serve.
[1:49:11] You love the Lord this morning. Is there
[1:49:13] is there is there any is there any in uh
[1:49:16] uh uh confusion?
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you have a question? And then
[1:49:22] write your question down and and send
[1:49:24] it. Let's uh you know let's let's answer
[1:49:26] your question if there's a question that
[1:49:29] comes in your mind concerning this. Now,
[1:49:31] so when we started this, I read
[1:49:34] something that brother Brand said in the
[1:49:36] message uh spoken word is the original
[1:49:39] seed and uh and I'm I'm still laboring
[1:49:43] with that in this subject to be able to
[1:49:46] to to bring that to you because now
[1:49:49] remember now our principal
[1:49:51] responsibility our principle
[1:49:54] responsibility
[1:49:55] is to glorify the father. Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Our question in everything that we do,
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; are you glorifying the father?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Is the father getting glory
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; out of what you are doing?
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Whether you are at work, whether you are
[1:50:13] at home,
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; is the father getting glory
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; out of what you are doing.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Because that is our our our principal
[1:50:23] purpose. Now, so we want to look at
[1:50:26] this. We want to look at this because
[1:50:28] just like just like I was telling you, I
[1:50:30] was listening to to to that I mean
[1:50:32] studying on that thing and brother B was
[1:50:34] talking about some things there in the
[1:50:36] message on setting song one of the
[1:50:38] series that he preached and I mean he
[1:50:40] was just he was talking about the
[1:50:42] uncertainty of times that we are living
[1:50:44] in. Talk about how our national security
[1:50:47] is uncertain. Our job is uncertain. He
[1:50:50] says uh uh uh uh even even family life
[1:50:54] is uncertain.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:56] He said family life is uncertain and and
[1:50:59] I mean he goes right into it. You know
[1:51:01] uh uh people divoring and all sorts of
[1:51:03] things and you talk about church life,
[1:51:06] people walking away from the faith and I
[1:51:08] mean he was just he was just talking
[1:51:10] about those things and I was just
[1:51:12] sitting there. I was saying oh my god
[1:51:15] this prophet of God is speaking in 1961
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; but addressing exactly what is happening
[1:51:23] in our land.
[1:51:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; He's speaking in 1961, but as addressing
[1:51:33] exactly what is happening in Abu Dh.
[1:51:41] I mean, I can go I can go back there and
[1:51:43] just read some of some of those things
[1:51:45] to you. Yeah. Uh uh and it will take
[1:51:48] much of our time. But he gets down and
[1:51:51] just talk about the uncertainty.
[1:51:54] The uncertainty that is that is just
[1:51:56] around us.
[1:52:00] Talk about how people are so afraid and
[1:52:03] they are digging holes and and trying to
[1:52:05] find safety in the earth. He says one of
[1:52:07] those those miser bombs can blast the
[1:52:10] whole earth and and get your bunger from
[1:52:12] under the earth. And I mean he's talking
[1:52:13] about all of these things and and uh uh
[1:52:16] uh you know and and and and and you just
[1:52:19] look at our time that we are living in
[1:52:21] and you see s uh man you see you see
[1:52:24] people uh you know uh uh people are
[1:52:27] crossing the border trying to go to to
[1:52:28] to Canada hoping that they can get you
[1:52:31] know uh a peaceful stay there. You get
[1:52:34] Canada has his own problem. Amen.
[1:52:38] He has his own problem. You know
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; people, God sent us a prophet.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; We are honored a prophetic voice.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know how much your faith has
[1:52:56] rised up to believe that Malachi 4 is
[1:52:59] the voice of God of this age.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I know uh uh uh the
[1:53:04] media is waring against it and all sorts
[1:53:06] of thing is worrying, blasting people
[1:53:08] mind. But I'm I'm telling you this
[1:53:10] morning that God sent us a prophet.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; If I ever come back to you and tell you
[1:53:17] that brother Brandham is not a prophet,
[1:53:19] don't believe me.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Don't believe me? Stay with your faith.
[1:53:25] Let me go with my error
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; because it would definitely be a spirit
[1:53:28] of error on me.
[1:53:37] And an age of information
[1:53:40] is just filling our minds. We are in we
[1:53:43] are in an information age. We are in an
[1:53:46] information age. You can search it out,
[1:53:49] you will find it. And that is the thing
[1:53:51] that is just that is that is uh is is is
[1:53:54] is conflating.
[1:53:58] It's conflicting because lot of the
[1:54:00] things that are said in the Bible, a
[1:54:01] little year, a little day.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; A little year and a little day.
[1:54:11] And the scriptures will tell us
[1:54:12] something and don't give us the the
[1:54:14] entire story. And now if our society now
[1:54:17] bring that thing on question, we have
[1:54:20] lot of scientific proof
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; to fight against just one verse in the
[1:54:24] Bible.
[1:54:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:46] When I read uh uh uh Mark chapter 6 this
[1:54:49] morning, as I was studying, I was I was
[1:54:52] looking into some commentary and uh uh
[1:54:56] you go back to Mark chapter 6 and tell
[1:54:58] you that Jesus came back to his own
[1:55:00] hometown where he grew up and all the
[1:55:03] people says is this not a carpenter son?
[1:55:07] is not his brother's uh uh and sisters
[1:55:10] called or his family name because Jesus
[1:55:13] is teaching in the temple and they are
[1:55:15] wondering where did he got this
[1:55:17] knowledge from.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; We were right here. We saw him growing
[1:55:22] up.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; For most of his life he was behind that
[1:55:27] wooden box in that carpenter shop. We
[1:55:30] never saw him going to school.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you really think about it
[1:55:38] is that uh we believe the Lord Jesus as
[1:55:41] our savior. You know, we we we hang our
[1:55:44] life on the testimony of his LIFE AND
[1:55:46] HIS RESURRECTION. BUT THIS BIBLE DID NOT
[1:55:49] REALLY tell us a lot about his
[1:55:52] upbringing.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; You read in the gospel, you really don't
[1:55:57] find
[1:55:58] some of the things of his upbringing. Do
[1:56:00] you know why God b God tithe in
[1:56:03] prophecy?
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, it blew my mind this morning. Let me
[1:56:07] share with you a little bit.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; I know I'm completely out of what I'm
[1:56:11] supposed to be preaching this morning,
[1:56:12] but u
[1:56:17] if I tell you once, I don't have to tell
[1:56:19] you again.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; At least God will know that I try my
[1:56:26] effort to tell you. Psalm chapter 69.
[1:56:32] Psalm chapter 69.
[1:56:37] Amen.
[1:56:44] Psalm chapter 69.
[1:56:50] Let's first look at this verse. We'll
[1:56:52] get back to the whole thing. Verse 9.
[1:56:55] Psalm chapter 69:9
[1:56:58] the Bible says, "For the zeal of thy
[1:57:00] house have eaten me up, and the reproach
[1:57:04] of them that reproach thee are fallen
[1:57:06] upon me." St. John chapter 2.
[1:57:21] I'm just supposed to preach my message.
[1:57:25] Go ahead. You already said I've come
[1:57:28] come here.
[1:57:30] And u
[1:57:33] St. John chapter 2. If you look in St.
[1:57:35] John chapter 2, you realize that the
[1:57:37] Bible says from verse 14, he found in
[1:57:40] the temple those that that sold oxins
[1:57:42] and sheep and dove and the changes of
[1:57:44] money sitting. And the Bible says, "And
[1:57:46] when he had made a scotch of small call,
[1:57:49] he drove them all out of the temple and
[1:57:53] the sheep and the oxen and and and pour
[1:57:55] out the changes of money and overthrew
[1:57:58] the temple
[1:58:00] and said unto them that sold dove, take
[1:58:05] these things hands,
[1:58:08] make not my father house, a house of
[1:58:12] merchandise." Listen to this now.
[1:58:15] and his disciple remember
[1:58:19] that it was written,
[1:58:21] "The zeal of the house has eaten me up."
[1:58:28] Let me see if I can be able to bring
[1:58:29] this to us this morning in a way that
[1:58:32] you can be able to capture it. Yes,
[1:58:34] Jesus.
[1:58:36] David said this hundreds of years ago.
[1:58:38] They had read it in B in Sunday school.
[1:58:41] They read it in the chapel and
[1:58:42] everything. That day when Jesus came
[1:58:45] into the temple and he took his whip and
[1:58:48] started whipping this man up, the spirit
[1:58:50] of the Lord, the Holy Ghost brought to
[1:58:52] their mind that this what he's doing is
[1:58:56] what David said.
[1:58:59] When David said in the psalm that the
[1:59:02] zeal of the house has eaten me up, this
[1:59:05] is the fulfillment of it.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Now, so you think about that. When you
[1:59:10] when you just think about that, then you
[1:59:12] realize that it was not only the zeal of
[1:59:16] the house has eaten me up. THERE ARE
[1:59:18] OTHER THINGS THAT DAVID said in the
[1:59:20] psalm that was concerning him.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 69. Let's go back there.
[1:59:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:49] Oh man.
[1:59:54] Lord, Lord.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:58] Psalm chapter 69.
[2:00:08] Now you can read the whole psalm. You
[2:00:11] realize that this this this psalm brings
[2:00:14] out some places in Jesus upbringing that
[2:00:18] you never that we would never never
[2:00:20] never think about.
[2:00:24] It starts right here.
[2:00:28] Save me, oh God,
[2:00:31] for the waters are come up.
[2:00:34] The waters are come in unto my soul. I
[2:00:37] sink in a deep mar where there is no
[2:00:39] standing. I am coming to deep waters
[2:00:41] where the floor I am wary of my crying.
[2:00:45] My throat is dried, my eyes, they that
[2:00:48] hit me without a cause are more than the
[2:00:51] head of my hand. They thou will destroy
[2:00:55] me being uh uh being my enemy wrongfully
[2:01:00] I might
[2:01:03] then I restore that which I took not
[2:01:06] away. Oh God that knoweth my foolishness
[2:01:10] my sin. Let not them that wait on thee,
[2:01:14] oh my Lord of hosts, be ashamed for thy
[2:01:18] sake. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:21] Now he starts to talk here now about the
[2:01:23] reproaches when you drop down here to
[2:01:26] verse seven. Because for that sake I
[2:01:29] have borne reproach. Shame has covered
[2:01:32] my face. I become a stranger unto my
[2:01:36] brethren and an alien unto
[2:01:40] my mother's children.
[2:01:43] And then we read that verse there. When
[2:01:45] I weep and casting my soul with fasting,
[2:01:50] that that was to my reproach, I make
[2:01:54] cyclops also my gardening, and I became
[2:01:58] a proverb to them. They that sat in the
[2:02:03] gates speak against me. And I was a son
[2:02:07] of the drunker. You check David live,
[2:02:10] you will never find these things.
[2:02:13] You will never find it. But if you check
[2:02:16] Jesus life, you will find it.
[2:02:20] Do you know what it was to be growing
[2:02:23] when nobody would believe that Mary saw
[2:02:27] an angel?
[2:02:30] The man that sat at the gate, even the
[2:02:32] drunkers, they make music
[2:02:36] out of his birth.
[2:02:41] vulgar music they made out of his birth.
[2:02:51] Can you can you imagine that?
[2:02:56] The kind of a reproach that came that
[2:02:58] came on him.
[2:03:01] You see, I made cycl my garment and I
[2:03:04] became a proverb.
[2:03:07] things that people will say
[2:03:10] they will make all sorts of slogan
[2:03:13] all sorts of things they will say about
[2:03:15] the creator when when you just read some
[2:03:18] of David's psy and and you really
[2:03:20] getting it you realize that uh honor
[2:03:23] prophecy the same way he prophesied the
[2:03:25] zeal of the house has eaten up and the
[2:03:28] disciples could remember by the spirit
[2:03:31] of God bringing back to their mind that
[2:03:33] this is the one that David was speaking
[2:03:35] about and And there are other things
[2:03:37] written right in this psalm
[2:03:40] that the Holy Ghost can help us to see
[2:03:42] that those things were never said about
[2:03:44] David.
[2:03:46] It was never said about David. Praise
[2:03:49] the Lord.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; He was not treated that way.
[2:03:54] David never came to firm until he came
[2:03:56] out there and challenged Goliath. And
[2:03:58] when he challenged Goliath, nobody never
[2:04:00] said evil about David. Nobody even
[2:04:02] thought about his childhood. They knew
[2:04:05] him as the giant killer.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; And the songs that he sang, the proverbs
[2:04:12] that they make about David was always a
[2:04:15] hero. He was always a hero.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; He was a man that took shame from our
[2:04:22] face.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; When Saul and his men COULD NOT DO
[2:04:26] ANYTHING, GOD GAVE US A LITTLE BOY. THAT
[2:04:29] WAS WHAT THEY SAID about David. What
[2:04:31] about our Lord Jesus Christ?
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; They make proverb
[2:04:36] concerning his birth.
[2:04:38] Can you imagine that? All they knew
[2:04:41] about him was just a capital sun.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; That's all they knew about him.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; That even he comes back to his own city,
[2:04:52] he can feed it. He can feed the
[2:04:54] rejection because it's on the minds of
[2:04:57] the people. They can never get over what
[2:05:00] they have perceived him to be.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT HE RAISED
[2:05:11] a Jara's daughter or whatever they said,
[2:05:13] when he comes back to his own city, he
[2:05:16] meet the same old news.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; He meet the same old ideas
[2:05:22] of the people.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; What they think of him.
[2:05:27] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; They can never go beyond that.
[2:05:32] Said a prophet is without honor except
[2:05:36] in his own hometown.
[2:05:40] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, may God just help us this morning.
[2:05:46] Amen.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Let's read there. The spoken word is the
[2:05:51] original seed.
[2:05:53] Like I said, I try to find a place to
[2:05:55] close this
[2:05:57] because from the beginning when we talk
[2:05:59] about uh uh uh God's partnership from
[2:06:02] the beginning, I was trying to bring to
[2:06:04] us to understand that when God made man
[2:06:07] in Genesis chapter 1 26 he made man male
[2:06:12] and female created he them.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; He make man male and female created he
[2:06:21] them. So he make two identity. He make
[2:06:24] two uh uh uh uh uh and and and there's a
[2:06:28] reason and we see right there that even
[2:06:31] from from the first thought of bringing
[2:06:32] forth himself in flesh, he brought them
[2:06:35] as a partner
[2:06:37] made and female. Praise the Lord. And
[2:06:40] the Bible would tell us in Genesis
[2:06:42] chapter 7, he made man out of the dust
[2:06:44] of the earth, but the female was not
[2:06:46] around.
[2:06:48] And there will be a time where God God
[2:06:50] himself will say it was not good for the
[2:06:53] man to be alone because in his purpose
[2:06:57] in his plan of redemption
[2:07:00] two is better than one.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; In his plane of redemption
[2:07:09] partnership, a man cannot be partner to
[2:07:12] himself.
[2:07:15] In the plan of redemption, it was all
[2:07:18] built on partnership.
[2:07:20] God will raise up his attributes to be
[2:07:23] partner to him.
[2:07:25] I'm going to say some things to you this
[2:07:27] morning and it's uh I hope that you be
[2:07:29] able to take it in good faith
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; and understand it.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; So when he brought the woman as a
[2:07:37] helpmate,
[2:07:38] praise the Lord.
[2:07:40] You have to realize, like I said, it was
[2:07:43] not Adam that was wanting a helpmate. IT
[2:07:46] WAS GOD THAT was bringing a helpmate.
[2:07:49] For what purpose? For his purpose.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; For this great picture that was in his
[2:07:56] mind.
[2:07:58] So if if our if our principal
[2:08:01] responsibility,
[2:08:03] our purpose is to GLORIFY THE FATHER.
[2:08:06] ADAM WAS GLORIFYING the father in one
[2:08:09] way and the way he was glorifying the
[2:08:12] father is to name the animals and and
[2:08:15] name the creation and name he was
[2:08:18] displaying God that way.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER HAD THE ABILITY to display the
[2:08:26] the the redemptive nature of God.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; He never had it. He never HAD THE
[2:08:32] ABILITY TO DISPLAY GOD as a healer. it
[2:08:36] was not in him.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; SO HE HAD HIS PURPOSE AND NOW GOD HAS TO
[2:08:44] BRING THE WOMAN ON the scene
[2:08:47] for her to also display her own h
[2:08:53] attributes that that that that was going
[2:08:55] to be displayed through her.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; She was going to meet her own purpose.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:03] AND THROUGH HER, THE ATTRIBUTE OF GOD
[2:09:05] BEING A SAVIOR, A HEALER, a deliverer,
[2:09:08] and all of these things will be
[2:09:10] manifested.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Are we seeing it?
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; So, YOU REALIZE THAT GOD HAS A PURPOSE
[2:09:21] FOR EVERY ONE OF US.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; And the beautiful thing about it then is
[2:09:29] that it's unique.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:09:33] Praise the Lord.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; It's very unique.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; It's when we can be able to see in THE
[2:09:40] NEXT PERSON OR HELP THEM THAT THEY CAN
[2:09:44] BE ABLE TO GLORIFY GOD.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; That God can BE ABLE TO GET GLORY OUT OF
[2:09:49] THEIR LIFE. I must be able TO HELP YOU
[2:09:52] FOR GOD to be able to get glory out of
[2:09:55] your life. I mean uh uh uh uh your glory
[2:09:58] is not attached to mine.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Let me say it that way. Amen.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE SELFISH OF ME JUST TO WARN
[2:10:06] ALL OF THE PRAISE. Y'ALL PUT MY NAME IN
[2:10:09] the song when we are singing. LET'S SAY
[2:10:11] BROTHER ONE, LET'S I mean, LET'S LET LET
[2:10:13] IT JUST BE LET IT JUST I MEAN IT IS VERY
[2:10:16] SELFISH BECAUSE THAT THAT IS NOT GOD'S
[2:10:18] PURPOSE.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; HE WANT TO GET GLORY FROM EACH AND EVERY
[2:10:23] ONE OF OUR individual lives.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO OUR PURPOSE IN partnership
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; is TO BE ABLE TO HELP ONE ANOTHER THAT
[2:10:34] THE FATHER WILL BE GLORIFIED IN YOU AND
[2:10:37] YOU WILL HELP ME THAT THE FATHER WILL BE
[2:10:39] GLORIFIED IN ME.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; But you see when the devil
[2:10:49] introduced
[2:10:52] his idea in Genesis 3, you have to know
[2:10:55] that Satan idea is
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; seage.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE THAT INTRODUCED THIS IDEA
[2:11:04] WHERE WE think the purpose of the woman
[2:11:08] is for the man to be glorified.
[2:11:11] See what brother Brandham said.
[2:11:14] My my my my
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; see what he says here. Spoken word is
[2:11:19] the original seed.
[2:11:21] All of God's songs must be the same.
[2:11:25] Yes, sir. To be born of the word and the
[2:11:28] spirit bring us back
[2:11:32] to the spoken word again.
[2:11:36] Like John chapter 3,
[2:11:39] you must be born again. He said to be
[2:11:42] born of the of the word and the spirit,
[2:11:45] it bring us back.
[2:11:48] It bring us back to the spoken word
[2:11:50] again.
[2:11:52] To be born of the water and the spirit,
[2:11:54] what does what does it do? It will bring
[2:11:57] you right back again onto the place of
[2:12:01] where you should have been at the
[2:12:04] beginning.
[2:12:06] See, that is the reason for Christ's
[2:12:09] death.
[2:12:11] bring us back again
[2:12:13] toward sons of God.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this now. This is where he
[2:12:18] says this. If Eve,
[2:12:22] if Eve will have brought forth that
[2:12:25] child, she will have finally done it.
[2:12:29] Praise the Lord,
[2:12:31] the virgin shall conceive. Eve will have
[2:12:35] done it.
[2:12:37] It will have brought forth a child
[2:12:40] without sex.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS IN IT WAS IN THE
[2:12:49] PURPOSE THAT GOD DESIGNED FOR HER.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. SO YOU SEE, EVEN THOUGH
[2:12:56] SHE FAILED, GOD STILL CAME BACK IN
[2:12:59] GENESIS 3:15 and said, "The seed of the
[2:13:02] woman
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; will bruise the head of the serpent."
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Because in God's mind, THE WOMAN WAS
[2:13:10] GOING TO BRING A seed without man
[2:13:14] intervention.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; That was what was in God's mind.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HER MAKEUP WAS TIED TO
[2:13:22] REDEMPTION.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I think many of us we are operating
[2:13:32] on a Genesis chapter 3. We need to go
[2:13:34] back before Genesis chapter 3 because
[2:13:37] that's where the the actual and original
[2:13:40] marriage uh covenant was was. It was not
[2:13:43] in Genesis chapter 3. Genesis chapter 3
[2:13:45] was WHAT THE SERPENT INTRODUCED TO US.
[2:13:52] And then when we come to this place
[2:13:54] where we we we we strive with one
[2:13:56] another and and and then we put pressure
[2:13:58] on our husbands and put pressure on our
[2:14:00] wives and we think that yeah yeah you
[2:14:03] know that and we quote all of this
[2:14:05] scripture
[2:14:06] and then in most cases it is just our
[2:14:10] own selfishness.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; It's just our own selfishness.
[2:14:20] You you see right there Paul will speak
[2:14:23] in Corinthian where he will say that uh
[2:14:26] when when a when a man is is is not
[2:14:28] married he he served the Lord better. He
[2:14:31] gave his service to the Lord. NOW IF
[2:14:33] HE'S MARRIED HE HAS TO BRING THAT
[2:14:36] SERVICE ALSO through his wife.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:47] That's the reason why you find that uh
[2:14:49] sometimes in many cases you will realize
[2:14:52] that oh so it a destroy family a throw
[2:14:56] home whom a PART IT AFFECTS THE LIFE OF
[2:14:58] THE CHILDREN. But when a man has has his
[2:15:02] faith rooted in God and in the word of
[2:15:04] God or the woman has her faith rooted in
[2:15:07] the word of God
[2:15:09] if a man will will abandon her she will
[2:15:12] still serve the Lord.
[2:15:15] And if God give her grace, she will
[2:15:17] still live up to that purpose of
[2:15:19] glorifying God.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz she's not going to get crazy and
[2:15:25] say, "Why he leave me?" So she start
[2:15:27] running around with every man. No, she
[2:15:29] will realize that she has a higher
[2:15:30] purpose.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; She has a higher purpose. Amen.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Even a man if the wife misbehave and and
[2:15:40] just RUN AWAY HE REALIZED THAT oh well
[2:15:43] okay this was part of it but the first
[2:15:45] HE WILL STILL LIVE HONORABLE.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THERE IS A HIGHER PURPOSE.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; But you see when we run our life ON
[2:15:58] GENESIS CHAPTER 3 WHICH IS THE SERPENT
[2:16:01] SEED. When we run our life on a debt,
[2:16:05] then all we do is that we just we want
[2:16:07] to destroy one another.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE WE THINK OUR LIFE is just
[2:16:16] tied to Satan purpose and not to God's
[2:16:19] purpose.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; MAN WAS GIVEN HIS responsibility
[2:16:27] before Genesis chapter 3. MAN WAS GIVEN
[2:16:30] HIS PURPOSE.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; But when Genesis chapter 3 comes, we we
[2:16:41] we bring all of those things to our own
[2:16:44] self-gratification,
[2:16:46] our own selfishness.
[2:16:48] We want to be worshiped.
[2:16:52] Either the man want to be worshiped now
[2:16:54] as the king or the woman must be
[2:16:56] worshiped as the queen.
[2:16:58] And then we leave God out of the
[2:17:00] picture.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; If you leave God out of the picture,
[2:17:05] it's three calls. Solomon says that will
[2:17:08] not be broken.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[2:17:14] Three calls that is bound together.
[2:17:16] That's what that is that is not broken.
[2:17:20] And that's what that's what we have to
[2:17:22] see. Our calling is to be able to EDIFY
[2:17:27] ONE ANOTHER, EMPOWER ONE ANOTHER,
[2:17:29] STRENGTHEN one another to be able to
[2:17:31] meet their purpose.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; LET ME HELP YOU. SO, SO, SO, SO YOU CAN
[2:17:39] BRING GLORY TO GOD. HELP ME. LET ME
[2:17:41] BRING GLORY TO GOD.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Not one person wanting the glory. Yes.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Because our PURPOSE IS TO BRING GLORY TO
[2:17:52] THE FATHER.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; You watch over the life.
[2:18:06] You find that
[2:18:08] you find that in many many successful
[2:18:10] people life.
[2:18:13] The moment they start becoming
[2:18:15] successful
[2:18:16] and the success is only tied to one
[2:18:19] party, the next party get jealous.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; It's only this person name the person
[2:18:29] feel that I'm not part of the success.
[2:18:33] So the next thing they try to do is
[2:18:36] either let's split it.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; So I can go and build my own foundation
[2:18:42] and call it h Jeremiah foundation.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; And you can stay with yours Susanna
[2:18:50] Foundation.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Because I want I want my name to be here
[2:18:55] also.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture I'm talking
[2:19:00] about?
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is the reason why it will
[2:19:04] be an evil thing young people for you to
[2:19:08] tie the purpose of your life to a man
[2:19:11] that you don't know about
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; or a woman that you don't know about
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; saying to yourself that when I get
[2:19:19] married
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; TIE YOUR PURPOSE TO JESUS CHRIST
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; AND KNOW THAT IF GOD GIVE YOU A PARTNER
[2:19:30] I WILL DO THE BEST FOR HIM TO GLORIFY
[2:19:33] GOD. I want him to do the BEST FOR ME TO
[2:19:35] GLORIFY GOD.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; But if you just you just you just make
[2:19:42] yourself like you don't have life. There
[2:19:44] is no future for you because this
[2:19:46] special person has not come. The special
[2:19:48] person is Jesus Christ.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; The one that have show you decency.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; That's the special person. Amen.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; And then whoever come along, we work
[2:20:00] together
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; to glorify this Jesus Christ.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; WE WORK TOGETHER TO GLORIFY THIS JESUS
[2:20:07] CHRIST THAT PUT THE VALUE UPON MY LIFE
[2:20:08] THAT you saw.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S HOW GOD DESIGNED IT.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; HE said his glory he will give to no
[2:20:23] man. That's right.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; He don't want YOU AS A SON OF GOD GIVING
[2:20:26] HIS GLORY TO YOUR WIFE.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; NEITHER DOES HE WANT THE WIFE GIVING HIS
[2:20:30] GLORY TO YOU.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; NO, we must bring the glory to the
[2:20:34] father.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; We must bring it to the father.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; It help us to be able to identify the
[2:20:44] unique ways that God has built us
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; because we are all not built the same.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; We are not controlled by a remote. We
[2:20:52] are controlled by a divine presence of
[2:20:54] God.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; And when we can BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT
[2:20:59] AND BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND
[2:21:01] BE ABLE TO PRAY for one another and be
[2:21:03] able to appreciate THE UNIQUE WAY THAT
[2:21:06] GOD HAS BEEN ABLE to to make us because
[2:21:08] he's the God of varieties.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; HE'S A GOD OF VARIETIES. HIS BUCKET HAS
[2:21:16] DIFFERENT COLOR flowers and different
[2:21:19] shapes. That's the way he designed man.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; And that's the thing that is carrying
[2:21:29] our generation so crazy.
[2:21:31] So crazy. They put their life on hold.
[2:21:34] THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THIS SPECIAL PERSON.
[2:21:36] WHEN THIS SPECIAL person come the whole
[2:21:38] thing, it become a different story.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; It become a different story. Do you know
[2:21:44] what it is? When you when you start TO
[2:21:46] REALIZE THAT MY PURPOSE in this life is
[2:21:49] to glorify THE FATHER AND I'M GOING TO
[2:21:51] GLORIFY HIM IN EVERYTHING THAT HE PLACED
[2:21:53] IN MY HAND WHATEVER THAT COMES BEFORE ME
[2:21:55] THE BEST THAT I CAN DO.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT COMPARING MYSELF TO ANYBODY. I
[2:22:00] DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE ANYBODY. I don't
[2:22:01] want to be a superstar. I don't want to
[2:22:03] be anybody on the internet. I want to be
[2:22:05] me.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; I want TO BE A SON OF GOD THAT IS ME
[2:22:08] THAT CAN live like me.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Lord,
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; give me grace."
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Give me grace and help me.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; When I fail, I come back and say, "Lord,
[2:22:22] help me. I'm failing.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; I realize I'm not bringing I'm not
[2:22:26] bringing glory to you in the things that
[2:22:27] I'm doing."
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; I'm becoming selfish in my attitude.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; I'm becoming selfish in my ways.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Can you hear my
[2:22:42] If two young people comes with that
[2:22:44] idea,
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; their life is so driven by glorifying
[2:22:48] God.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; And they can look at this person and
[2:22:52] says, "Well, you you I mean, why you
[2:22:55] stop your prayer life? I'm not seeing
[2:22:56] you praying. I'm not seeing you reading
[2:22:57] the word."
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; These are all OF THE THINGS YOU WERE
[2:23:02] DOING BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED. WHY YOU
[2:23:04] STOP doing it?
[2:23:08] Amen.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY THAT GOD DESIGNED IT.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; That's his design.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; But you see the same thing that people
[2:23:19] do,
[2:23:21] they do the same thing. We feel like
[2:23:25] the church need us more than we need the
[2:23:27] church.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if they make BBS, I'm not even
[2:23:32] going back to that place.
[2:23:34] That church said is not that not the
[2:23:35] only church you that's that's the kind
[2:23:38] of an attitude that people feel that
[2:23:41] they have take the word and correct them
[2:23:43] they get angry
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; they can find another place and go
[2:23:48] praise the Lord.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; And that is the same thing that we do.
[2:23:51] We bring that thing right into our
[2:23:53] relationship
[2:23:55] into our lives.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE GET A JOB, we feel like we need
[2:24:03] this job.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; I need this job to pay my bill.
[2:24:08] Praise the Lord.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; So everything at a job is Yes, sir.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Because you feel like you need it.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When it comes to our
[2:24:20] home and our livelihood, the church of
[2:24:23] God know
[2:24:25] they need you. So they have to beg.
[2:24:30] Brother, we didn't we are not seeing you
[2:24:31] in church.
[2:24:33] We are not seeing you in a few days.
[2:24:36] Yeah, bro. You need to be in church,
[2:24:38] man.
[2:24:44] Praise the Lord. What kind of a biblical
[2:24:46] pattern is that?
[2:24:50] Son of God, I will beg you to to to
[2:24:52] fulfill your divine purpose.
[2:24:57] that we should beg you to come to
[2:24:59] church.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Well, I've not been in church for one
[2:25:03] week. Nobody call me. Who did you call
[2:25:04] that you were not coming to church?
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Whom you told that you were not coming.
[2:25:13] BUT THAT IS THE MENTALITY that the
[2:25:16] church needs you
[2:25:18] because why? You feel like you are a
[2:25:20] member. You only do those things in
[2:25:22] clubs and organization.
[2:25:26] Why? Because you are donating to them.
[2:25:28] They need your donation.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; So if if they don't see you, they have
[2:25:33] to call you so you can bring your
[2:25:34] donation.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; You don't do that to the to the to the
[2:25:37] the kingdom of God.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Do that to the house of God where you
[2:25:41] supposed to know you are a son of God.
[2:25:43] You have a purpose. And God gave you a
[2:25:45] little body, a little boy CALLED A
[2:25:47] CHURCH WHERE YOU SUPPOSED TO COME AND
[2:25:49] AND AND AND HELP THE GROWTH OF THE
[2:25:51] CHURCH. AMEN.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; You want to be so special that we should
[2:25:55] beg you.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; And we bring those things into our home.
[2:26:05] Something will go wrong. WE SHOULD SIT
[2:26:07] DOWN AS AS FAMILY AND TALK FOR THE
[2:26:09] BETTERMENT of our home.
[2:26:13] He says no you will have to beg me
[2:26:18] and before you really realize you are
[2:26:20] destroying
[2:26:24] what's supposed to be a divine structure
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; was supposed to be that something that
[2:26:29] God ordained through which you will be
[2:26:32] able to glorify himself
[2:26:36] we destroy it on the basis of our own
[2:26:39] selfishness
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; because We want to be the person in the
[2:26:43] room. We should be the person that
[2:26:45] should be praised. We should be the
[2:26:47] person that should be thanked. We should
[2:26:48] be the person. Then we are the person
[2:26:50] that we are worshiping. Then
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; why you say you worshiping God? When you
[2:26:55] have set yourself on the throne as God.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why he redeem us from
[2:27:07] sin and make us better.
[2:27:11] He's making us better so we can bring
[2:27:14] better praise to him.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; Because if he make us BETTER AND GIVE US
[2:27:19] RIGHTEOUSNESS, WE WILL LIVE A RIGHTEOUS
[2:27:21] life and people will see our life and
[2:27:24] glorify the father.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WORK. WE MAKE GOD
[2:27:31] BETTER AND HE MAKE US BETTER.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T MAKE GOD LIKE A GOD THAT DON'T
[2:27:36] KEEP his promises.
[2:27:40] Praise the Lord. EVEN IF IT IS NOT
[2:27:42] HAPPENING, WE SHOUT ON THE HELL AND SAY,
[2:27:44] "I KNOW MY GOD IS ABLE."
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I know he's able.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; Because he's an able. He's a able God.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; We have reduced the righteous
[2:28:00] commandments of God to our selfish
[2:28:03] ambition,
[2:28:05] our unconverted ambition.
[2:28:08] That's the reason why sometimes when we
[2:28:10] are trapped in things we don't know how
[2:28:12] to come out
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; because we have failed ourself with our
[2:28:17] own
[2:28:19] you know our own selfishness.
[2:28:24] Praise the Lord.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; What a what a mighty God we serve.
[2:28:33] Oh what a mighty God we serve.
[2:28:38] But says Eve will have brought that
[2:28:40] child if she did not listen to the
[2:28:42] serpent, she will have brought even
[2:28:44] though she failed, God still came back
[2:28:47] and said the woman will have a seat.
[2:28:52] Why? Why he had to say that?
[2:28:55] Because it was his thought concerning
[2:28:57] her. Even though she failed, he will
[2:29:00] still have a woman that will be a virgin
[2:29:03] that will bring forth a son.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Because that was his purpose for her
[2:29:09] life.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; God don't turn his back on us when we
[2:29:13] fail.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; When we fail in our purpose,
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; he don't say get up from here, you fail.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; He stand back. He want to watch you as a
[2:29:23] son and as a daughter and see what your
[2:29:25] attitude will be.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you really believe
[2:29:28] in your purpose?
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Because it's God that has the purpose.
[2:29:33] Do you really believe in it? When you
[2:29:35] believe in it, then you go back to God
[2:29:36] and say, "Oh God, have mercy on me. I
[2:29:38] HAVE FAILED YOU, LORD. REDEEM ME.
[2:29:40] RESTORE ME."
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Then God step on the scene.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; And starts to bring that thing through
[2:29:47] you. AND BECAUSE YOU REALIZE YOU FAIL,
[2:29:49] you become so humble. You say, "Lord,
[2:29:51] I'm not watching for you to use me. Oh
[2:29:54] God, I FAIL YOU." BUT YET STILL YOU
[2:29:56] TRUST ME.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; The kind of a God we serve.
[2:30:03] The same way we we operate with our
[2:30:06] selfish purpose, we apply it to God
[2:30:09] because we are selfish. So we think that
[2:30:11] he's selfish. When we fail, then we say,
[2:30:14] "Lord, God will not use me again. I
[2:30:16] don't think he can ever make anything
[2:30:17] out of me again." Praise the Lord. Then
[2:30:20] we start going away from the Lord and
[2:30:22] start going away from the Lord.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; But God is determined in his purpose.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; He's determined. Very determined in his
[2:30:33] purpose.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Very determined
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; in his purpose.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Very determined in his purpose.
[2:30:43] Her last uh uh Sunday, a good friend,
[2:30:47] good friend of mine, a preacher, uh the
[2:30:50] brother Steven that brought us the the
[2:30:52] goat.
[2:30:54] We went to Liber. Yeah. Good friend of
[2:30:56] mine. He went to be with the Lord.
[2:31:00] died in in an accident and I was so told
[2:31:04] yesterday I mean last Sunday didn't
[2:31:06] leave for me. I was so tall cuz I just
[2:31:11] spoke with him and um and I really had
[2:31:14] on my heart to talk to him about
[2:31:16] something that I heard
[2:31:19] and I I was so when he called me, he
[2:31:21] called me from Nigeria because he was
[2:31:23] there. His son was getting married and
[2:31:26] he called me and I I told him I said we
[2:31:28] spoke a little bit and I says, "Yeah, I
[2:31:31] really need to talk to you when you get
[2:31:32] back home. Call me." And uh uh we never
[2:31:36] got talk. He he died on on Christmas
[2:31:39] Eve.
[2:31:41] And I I just I was just so so troubled
[2:31:44] and I just felt like well okay I think
[2:31:46] the Lord knew best and the Lord took
[2:31:49] care of him.
[2:31:52] The Lord took care of him.
[2:31:55] Living in such a time of uncertainty
[2:31:58] you know think but they have very good
[2:32:01] brother
[2:32:02] good brothers. He moved to one of the
[2:32:05] region of our country that he started
[2:32:07] work there and uh lately I heard he's
[2:32:11] you know he was uh uh he have moved to
[2:32:15] another area start another church and
[2:32:17] and he was going to dedicate some
[2:32:19] instruments that are bought and all that
[2:32:21] and and his life came to an end
[2:32:26] but we have to realize God's purpose of
[2:32:28] our life is far above all our human
[2:32:31] achievement all of the things that we
[2:32:33] can achieve and all of the things that
[2:32:35] we can do, all of the names that we can
[2:32:36] make for ourself. We have to understand
[2:32:39] what his purpose is.
[2:32:42] That's the thing that when you grab it
[2:32:44] brings satisfaction.
[2:32:46] It bring you to a place of rest
[2:32:49] because you realize that
[2:32:52] I think this is what he want me to do.
[2:32:55] I think this is where this is this is
[2:32:58] this is the reason why I was born.
[2:33:04] This is what he designed me for.
[2:33:08] It brings such a rest.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; I might never get to the place to have
[2:33:27] all of the things that uh uh really
[2:33:29] desired in this life. But just to know
[2:33:31] that he loved me,
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; just to know that he thought of me,
[2:33:39] just to know that he designed a purpose
[2:33:42] in his economy for me.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; That is more than enough.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; That is more than enough.
[2:33:54] And whatever I will do that the father
[2:33:56] will be glorified.
[2:33:59] And in the same word, I will be able to
[2:34:01] encourage others
[2:34:03] to be able to hit their own purpose.
[2:34:07] It's not like forget what you doing. You
[2:34:09] focus on me and just me now and me now
[2:34:12] and me.
[2:34:13] That's selfishness.
[2:34:19] That's selfishness. That's the that's
[2:34:21] that's that's Genesis chapter 3
[2:34:25] that was introduced by the serpent sea.
[2:34:29] That's not God's intended purpose.
[2:34:32] Praise the Lord.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; So the word help me
[2:34:38] that word has just we have used it all
[2:34:40] sorts of way around the message. But
[2:34:42] really go instead of look at that word,
[2:34:44] really go and look at the the the the
[2:34:48] concordance and and see that when the
[2:34:50] when the Bible says the Lord is my help
[2:34:54] is the very same root word where that
[2:34:57] word help me comes from.
[2:35:02] The Lord is my help.
[2:35:06] So if God gave a man gave a man a wife
[2:35:10] to be a helpmate,
[2:35:13] it is not just only for his purpose.
[2:35:23] He sees somebody through whom the Lord
[2:35:26] is my help. And in any way that God will
[2:35:29] use her to be a help to bring you on
[2:35:33] your knees and straighten your life up,
[2:35:34] God will do it.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. One time he gave Moses a stubborn
[2:35:38] one.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; And she said, "What a bloody husband you
[2:35:45] are.
[2:35:47] You're running after the commission and
[2:35:48] your sons are not even circumcised."
[2:35:53] And the prophet of God will come and
[2:35:54] tell us that if there were not a zapora,
[2:35:57] there would not be a Moses.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Oh people, God didn't send us a message
[2:36:08] to make a religion. God sent us a
[2:36:11] message to bring us in relationship with
[2:36:13] him for us to be able to understand his
[2:36:16] mind and understand his purpose for our
[2:36:18] life.
[2:36:20] The thing that will give our life a
[2:36:22] meaning
[2:36:24] is not just to join a church and get a
[2:36:27] certain dress code.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I I hope that uh I labor with you
[2:36:43] today to be able to to bring a certain
[2:36:46] level of honesty.
[2:36:48] Amen.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; Right from the beginning, he make man
[2:36:53] male and female.
[2:36:55] Right from there, that's God's in
[2:36:59] everything he needs. He needs a partner.
[2:37:03] He partnership us in every way.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; Give us two hands so one can help the
[2:37:07] other.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; He gave us two feet so one can help the
[2:37:13] other.
[2:37:16] Two ears. So if this ear don't hear what
[2:37:19] this they are saying here this one will
[2:37:21] hear it
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; and even the way that he designed our
[2:37:25] body he design it in a way of
[2:37:27] partnership.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; Oh God
[2:37:38] may he be able to find a partner in you.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; May God be able to find a partner in
[2:37:44] you. Amen.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; May God be able to partnership with
[2:37:49] himself with you
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; to be able to bring forth his purpose,
[2:37:54] his desire
[2:37:56] to make it known in your life.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:38:03] Amen.
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; For him to be able to make it known in
[2:38:07] your life.
[2:38:13] You look at the I was just thinking
[2:38:16] about the life of uh of uh of many many
[2:38:20] people
[2:38:22] uh many people.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; I was s
[2:38:42] watching a little documentary yesterday
[2:38:47] on
[2:38:49] u a single that I love, Dy Rambo.
[2:38:55] Me and my guest were watching it a
[2:38:57] little bit and and uh I've watched it
[2:39:01] before, but I was there was something
[2:39:03] that was on my mind I wanted to look at
[2:39:06] and uh in and uh uh You can you can see
[2:39:11] that all through the ages with different
[2:39:13] people that God used
[2:39:20] even with John Wesley.
[2:39:24] John Wesley dad Samuel was a very ragid
[2:39:28] Methodist preacher
[2:39:31] and he was just so such a rough man that
[2:39:35] he never helped.
[2:39:37] John had a sisters to have a successful
[2:39:40] marriage.
[2:39:42] None of them had a successful marriage.
[2:39:46] That's the reason why in the in the 17
[2:39:48] children of Susanna Wesley, you only
[2:39:51] hear about John and Charles
[2:39:56] because their father and that thing
[2:39:58] affected John. It affected it affected
[2:40:00] John. He never got married on time.
[2:40:04] Never got married early because he
[2:40:06] affected him. He saw how his older
[2:40:09] sisters, you know, ran from one divorce
[2:40:12] to another.
[2:40:15] It affected him.
[2:40:19] So even when he got married, being the
[2:40:21] preacher,
[2:40:27] he got married to
[2:40:30] a lady that had a different she she had
[2:40:32] a different almost like a different
[2:40:33] vision. She was not caught like John to
[2:40:37] be able to support the ministry
[2:40:40] and all of that. She will lock that
[2:40:42] preacher up
[2:40:45] from traveling.
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm telling you a true story. I mean
[2:40:51] it's all in the public domain. You can
[2:40:53] go and search it out.
[2:40:57] But you know what happened? John Wesley
[2:41:01] attributed the success of his ministry
[2:41:04] to his wife.
[2:41:07] He said every time she would do that, it
[2:41:09] would take him into praying.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; And he will cry to God and he will cry
[2:41:16] to God. That woman will pull John by the
[2:41:19] hair from one part of the room to the
[2:41:20] other.
[2:41:26] So there not only men can abuse, women,
[2:41:28] women can abuse also.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; Let me just leave you right there.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; But this what this is a churchish
[2:41:37] messenger.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; You see the pre the reason there is that
[2:41:44] John saw his purpose before he met his
[2:41:46] wife.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; He knew his purpose. Yeah.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; So there is nothing that she was doing,
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; he was protecting his purpose.
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW HE WAS TREATED, he kept
[2:42:04] his purpose.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; He knew he was called to preach the
[2:42:07] gospel.
[2:42:11] Praise the Lord.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; She would get mad. John is traveling and
[2:42:16] they will settle it and then he will
[2:42:18] travel again.
[2:42:21] But the final thing there is that the
[2:42:23] beauty of this picture
[2:42:26] he gave his wife his crown. He says I
[2:42:30] attribute the success of my ministry to
[2:42:32] her because she kept me on my knees.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he saw his purpose.
[2:42:50] Tony Rambo
[2:42:52] 8 years old.
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; She was playing in the pool and and and
[2:43:00] the Lord just started to break. You you
[2:43:02] can even look at there look at the life
[2:43:04] of Fanny Crosby
[2:43:06] the very same thing. She was a gifted
[2:43:08] woman. Right. Right from a child,
[2:43:13] very gifted.
[2:43:19] She started writing songs. It would just
[2:43:22] come to her head, you know, compose. She
[2:43:25] would compose songs. The first song her
[2:43:28] mother told her, her mother said, "You
[2:43:30] pay a price for this."
[2:43:33] She said, "I as a little girl, I did not
[2:43:35] understand what mama meant.
[2:43:39] Because as a eight years old to compose,
[2:43:41] to have such a composition, it has to be
[2:43:44] a heavenly gift.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; Her daddy wanted her to play h rock and
[2:43:52] roll, country rock and roll music. And
[2:43:55] when she gave her heart to the Lord, she
[2:43:57] had to go away from home at 12 years old
[2:44:02] because she would not play for her daddy
[2:44:04] in the club. her father kick her out of
[2:44:07] the house.
[2:44:09] 12 years old, little girl going away and
[2:44:14] getting over there to a a little church.
[2:44:17] She started playing singing
[2:44:20] and the Lord was just blessing her life.
[2:44:23] A very same very same story with Fanny
[2:44:25] Crosby. If you if you ever read your
[2:44:27] life, you realize that that was where
[2:44:30] she met her husband. You see, he was
[2:44:33] attracted to her gift.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; It would have been better if he found
[2:44:39] his purpose.
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; Well, he was attracted to her gift. They
[2:44:44] got married. They had a child. Uh
[2:44:46] because of complication, they couldn't
[2:44:48] have other children.
[2:44:51] But you have to real she you have to
[2:44:53] realize that this this this young lady
[2:44:56] just from a childhood
[2:44:58] you know she had this gift and as and as
[2:45:02] their music thing started to to to uh to
[2:45:05] grow up
[2:45:08] it's almost like he was feeling like he
[2:45:10] was left out
[2:45:15] because it was Dy Ramble they wanted to
[2:45:17] hear singing it was Dy Rambo And that
[2:45:21] affected him
[2:45:24] and he started to live wrong in their
[2:45:26] relationship.
[2:45:29] Oh, how how he almost destroy her life.
[2:45:32] She attempted to take her own life.
[2:45:36] But God in his mercy rescue her.
[2:45:40] After the second time, after the third
[2:45:43] time,
[2:45:45] she said, "I went down to a little
[2:45:46] creek, a little cabin, and just prayed
[2:45:50] and and cried to God, what is this
[2:45:52] happening to me?"
[2:45:55] And she realized that the Lord said
[2:45:59] because you stopped trusting me.
[2:46:02] And when she when she when she could
[2:46:04] just gain the courage to ask God for
[2:46:07] grace and mercy you see so these things
[2:46:09] happen. I read something here to you and
[2:46:12] then I close. I don't know how I got
[2:46:14] myself into this supposed to close ever
[2:46:16] since.
[2:46:19] But
[2:46:27] have brother Brandham said this morning.
[2:46:30] He said, "I'm so glad." He said, "From a
[2:46:32] young man, the Lord showed me this that
[2:46:35] I'm so glad that the Lord got a hold of
[2:46:37] me before the church."
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "So, no matter how much how how
[2:46:43] bad the church treat me,
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that the Lord got a hold of
[2:46:46] me."
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; And that's what I would say is let the
[2:46:52] Lord get a hold of you before this
[2:46:53] message.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:57] Brother Brandham in the message paradox
[2:47:00] he talks about a young man you know that
[2:47:03] was born in a certain family with a
[2:47:04] certain attitude
[2:47:07] and he says here I said
[2:47:11] that may be all right
[2:47:16] the the the the
[2:47:18] outall
[2:47:20] okay you are not seeing this
[2:47:25] all the outward motion he He might be
[2:47:28] identified as a believer with the
[2:47:31] believers. Identify as a believer
[2:47:33] because he's with the believer. But
[2:47:36] until he is regenerated, born again, I
[2:47:39] advise that the young man to never marry
[2:47:43] a woman, he will make hell on earth for
[2:47:46] her
[2:47:48] until that gentle, sweet, forgiving
[2:47:50] spirit of Christ comes in.
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:47:54] then that will be a paradox.
[2:47:59] Praise the Lord.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; And and many times that's what we are
[2:48:04] seeing
[2:48:06] because why
[2:48:08] people tie their purpose to marriage.
[2:48:13] Your purpose is not to marry. It's part
[2:48:16] of it.
[2:48:17] &gt;&gt; But that's not your purpose.
[2:48:20] You mean that the only reason why God
[2:48:22] made you is just to be a wife to
[2:48:23] somebody?
[2:48:26] &gt;&gt; You have they will have married you from
[2:48:28] the day you were born.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; If that was your purpose, we have hold
[2:48:33] you as a baby and do your wedding and
[2:48:35] turn you to your husband.
[2:48:39] But that's not your purpose. That was
[2:48:41] part of it.
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; He wanted you to be a daughter
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; that will enjoy your daddy and enjoy
[2:48:49] your mommy. Praise the Lord.
[2:48:52] &gt;&gt; And he can be able to get glory out of
[2:48:54] your youthfulness.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be you to be a young lady
[2:48:58] where you can be able to glorify him
[2:49:01] with decency.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; When every young woman is ruining their
[2:49:05] life with one, two, three, five
[2:49:07] boyfriends, God will keep his hand on
[2:49:09] you for you to be a young woman.
[2:49:14] that says until I walk until I walk down
[2:49:17] thy eye
[2:49:19] and he got glory out of that and then he
[2:49:23] will want to bring you also into a
[2:49:24] relationship but not to be a slave to a
[2:49:27] man.
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:49:29] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:49:31] he will also want you to glorify him
[2:49:33] with motherhood.
[2:49:37] Just like you glorify him with womanhood
[2:49:40] and you glorify him with your virgin
[2:49:42] saint, he will want you to glorify him
[2:49:44] with motherhood.
[2:49:51] And the purpose of your husband is to
[2:49:54] bring you to that place to give you all
[2:49:56] the support for you to be a successful
[2:49:58] mother.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; That's the very same thing with the man.
[2:50:08] He want you to to be a to be a father to
[2:50:12] be able to experience having a vision
[2:50:15] for the family and holding
[2:50:17] responsibility.
[2:50:20] Then you want the wife to be able to
[2:50:23] support you to be able to grab
[2:50:26] that vision.
[2:50:29] When a woman can be able to make the man
[2:50:32] the kind of a man that that she wants
[2:50:35] and a man makes the woman the kind of a
[2:50:37] woman that he wants is that when he
[2:50:40] faction in his mind and expect you to
[2:50:42] correct yourself quick quick quick
[2:50:46] just because of the fantasy of his mind.
[2:50:49] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:50:53] God bless you.
[2:50:58] God bless you. I I I want you to see the
[2:51:01] I want you to be able to grab the
[2:51:03] principle.
[2:51:05] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just get into this thing
[2:51:07] as if to say I'm I'm kind of angry. I'm,
[2:51:10] you know, I'm I'm I'm witch hunting
[2:51:12] somebody. I'm not witch hunting anybody.
[2:51:16] You see the the thing there is that it
[2:51:20] some of the things that grabbed you and
[2:51:21] you say, "Oh my god, why I didn't see
[2:51:23] this thing all along?"
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; Why I didn't realize that this is what
[2:51:29] it is
[2:51:33] that this is what it is.
[2:51:37] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, can can you imagine for you for
[2:51:41] for you to expect me to be the kind of a
[2:51:44] pastor that you want me to be when you
[2:51:47] really did not make me,
[2:51:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, I I would just be
[2:51:55] working on everybody remote control
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; because it would just all to be at a
[2:51:59] place I want to satisfy you. And then I
[2:52:02] I gets to the place where I just I I
[2:52:04] want you to be the kind of a church that
[2:52:06] I want you to be. So you know what is
[2:52:08] going to make me an ANGRY PREACHER.
[2:52:10] EVERY SUNDAY I COME I GOING to be
[2:52:12] shouting. THE BROTHER BRANDON SAID 10
[2:52:14] MINUTES BEFORE THE DOOR OPEN YOU'RE
[2:52:16] SUPPOSED TO BE DOWN there
[2:52:19] when I'm not helping you to bring you to
[2:52:21] church.
[2:52:22] I'm not contributing to how you are
[2:52:24] sustaining yourself through the week.
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; You see? So which mean I have fashioned
[2:52:30] something in my mind
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; and because I have faction it or maybe
[2:52:35] I'm looking at the other church that's
[2:52:37] what I'm looking at. So I create that
[2:52:39] picture in my mind now it makes me a
[2:52:42] frustrated preacher
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; AND ALL I DO IS JUST COME and hear are
[2:52:47] the people.
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; That's that's not the way God designed
[2:52:52] it.
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; No, that's not the way God designed it.
[2:52:58] He designed it for me. IF IF IF THAT'S
[2:53:01] WHAT I EXPECT OF YOU, I I need to help
[2:53:03] to bring you there.
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; I'm your helpmate
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; just like you are my helpmate.
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come
[2:53:41] Sometimes you get all of these fantasy
[2:53:43] in your mind.
[2:53:45] I was listening to a young preacher that
[2:53:48] says how he complained about everything
[2:53:50] in the church.
[2:53:51] He complained how the preacher can
[2:53:53] preach long. He complained about this.
[2:53:55] He complained about that.
[2:53:59] When he finally became the pastor of
[2:54:00] that church,
[2:54:02] he realized how wrong he was.
[2:54:06] How wrong
[2:54:08] he was. That everything he was
[2:54:10] complaining about, it was just a fantasy
[2:54:12] in his mind.
[2:54:14] It was just a MENTAL WORKOUT FAR from
[2:54:18] the reality.
[2:54:22] And sometimes that's the way we are.
[2:54:26] We get things so woke up in our mind
[2:54:33] and it's far from the reality.
[2:54:43] Oh, let my faith
[2:54:48] let my faith unite my body with the
[2:54:50] spirit of God.
[2:54:54] My faith and my and the spirit of God
[2:54:56] uniting to be able to bring my body
[2:54:59] under subjection.
[2:55:07] Lord, I want to love you more
[2:55:14] than I ever have before.
[2:55:20] You are easier to adore.
[2:55:27] Lord, I want to love you more.
[2:55:32] Oh Lord, I want to love you more
[2:55:40] than I ever have before.
[2:55:46] You so easy to adore.
[2:55:53] Lord, I want to love you more.
[2:55:56] I want to praise you. Lord, I want to
[2:56:00] praise you more
[2:56:05] than I ever have before.
[2:56:12] You so wanted to be praised.
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to praise you.
[2:56:22] Let's praise him now. Oh Lord, I want to
[2:56:26] praise you more
[2:56:31] than I ever have before.
[2:56:37] You worth to be praised.
[2:56:43] Lord, I want to praise. I want to serve
[2:56:46] you, Father.
[2:56:48] Yes, Lord. I want to serve you more
[2:56:56] than I ever have before.
[2:57:02] Serving you is such a joy.
[2:57:08] Lord, I want to serve you more.
[2:57:13] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I want to serve you more.
[2:57:21] than I ever have before.
[2:57:27] Serving you is such a joy,
[2:57:33] Lord. I want to serve you.
[2:57:40] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[2:57:43] Thank you, Lord.
[2:57:47] I hope you understood. I hope I hope the
[2:57:49] grace of God help you to understand
[2:57:52] where I'm I'm going this uh this morning
[2:57:56] and uh uh
[2:58:03] I just pray that the Lord will will be
[2:58:06] able to deal with your heart and he will
[2:58:08] he will be able to
[2:58:12] to make the picture more clearer to you
[2:58:15] and then you'll be able to reveal reveal
[2:58:18] his purpose to you.
[2:58:23] When you grab that thing as the purpose
[2:58:25] of God and and you know your your life
[2:58:29] is settled on it, you will have
[2:58:31] disappointment here and you will have
[2:58:33] disappointment there and uh sometimes
[2:58:36] your children may not even turn out to
[2:58:38] be uh what you really want them to be.
[2:58:41] But in all of that, God will also help
[2:58:43] you to realize that he has a purpose for
[2:58:46] their life. And and and and and you
[2:58:48] trusting in his purpose. You are not the
[2:58:51] one that is driving everything. You you
[2:58:53] are looking to the father. You are
[2:58:55] believing the father. You know, you you
[2:58:57] are resting on the father. You know that
[2:59:00] uh with God, he can never fail.
[2:59:05] His purpose is never defeated.
[2:59:13] Even if you are you are disappointed in
[2:59:15] a certain areas of your life, he will
[2:59:18] come around and and make you to see the
[2:59:20] bigger picture.
[2:59:22] And then he will make you to rejoice.
[2:59:27] He will say I I I thank God that he have
[2:59:31] me in this place. I thank God
[2:59:34] that uh you know he's he he placed this
[2:59:39] person in my life.
[2:59:42] It's God's choosing.
[2:59:45] It's God's choosing.
[2:59:48] Even for us to be here is God's
[2:59:51] choosing. I came with a dravening desire
[2:59:54] in my heart to to go down to Lama, Ohio.
[2:59:58] I wanted to be there with Looney Jenkins
[3:00:00] and get so involved in mission and well
[3:00:03] I mean God wanted me to be here
[3:00:07] and when when it all get over he's going
[3:00:10] to ship my next destination.
[3:00:19] If we can just
[3:00:22] learn to look at our life from God's
[3:00:25] perspective,
[3:00:28] Lord, your purpose,
[3:00:30] the things that you have designed,
[3:00:33] the things that you have appointed for
[3:00:35] us. Let's bow our house together.
[3:00:38] Heavenly Father,
[3:00:40] Lord, just just caught up in this uh
[3:00:43] channel of thought, Lord. I can just go
[3:00:45] on Lord God in preaching. But Father, my
[3:00:49] my desire, Lord God, is that the people
[3:00:52] will be able to see it.
[3:00:55] Our responsibility to live every day is
[3:00:58] to glorify you.
[3:01:00] Every day, Lord God, when you give us
[3:01:03] the breath of life, every day, Lord,
[3:01:06] Father God, when you give us strength in
[3:01:08] our body,
[3:01:11] at the end of the day, can we sit down
[3:01:14] and be able to see how many fruits that
[3:01:17] we brought to the father?
[3:01:21] How was God glorified in the things that
[3:01:23] we did?
[3:01:29] Oh Jesus.
[3:01:33] Oh Jesus.
[3:01:44] Blessed be your name. Father Lord God.
[3:01:48] We have labored around this subject
[3:01:50] Lord. We have labored around this
[3:01:51] thought God.
[3:01:54] Father, Lord, our desire, Lord God, is
[3:01:57] that you would just be able to bring the
[3:02:00] internal ingredients, Lord, the internal
[3:02:02] thoughts out of it, Lord, Father, to
[3:02:04] help your children, oh God,
[3:02:08] and we have to go through trials in this
[3:02:10] life. And the moment we can understand
[3:02:13] it that is all part of God's purpose for
[3:02:16] our life. It bring us comfort. It bring
[3:02:19] us relief. We can say it there. We can
[3:02:21] say just like Shedra, Misha and
[3:02:23] Abednego. Even if the Lord do not
[3:02:26] deliver us, we will not deny him. But we
[3:02:30] know that our God is more than able.
[3:02:38] Father, I pray
[3:02:40] this afternoon, Lord God, that your
[3:02:42] grace, Lord, would just help every one
[3:02:45] of us, Lord.
[3:02:47] Everyone under the sound of my voice, oh
[3:02:49] God, Father, and even those, Lord Jesus,
[3:02:52] that will have the opportunity
[3:02:56] to follow the service, Lord, watching,
[3:02:58] oh God, I pray that Lord, you will be
[3:03:00] able to bring out, Father God,
[3:03:03] the internal thoughts, Lord, Father,
[3:03:05] that is behind this. That's what
[3:03:06] matters.
[3:03:08] That's what matters, Lord. That's what
[3:03:11] matters, oh God.
[3:03:28] Let's just forget about ourselves.
[3:03:33] I'll concentrate on him
[3:03:36] and worship him.
[3:03:42] Help me to forget about myself,
[3:03:46] concentrate on you and worship
[3:03:51] you.
[3:03:54] Oh, let us forget about ourselves.
[3:04:00] Concentrate on Christ and worship him.
[3:04:11] Worship him
[3:04:13] Jesus
[3:04:15] Christ.
