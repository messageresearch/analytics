[44:14] uh germinate to be able to put forth
[44:16] roots
[44:17] so we see here that we having
[44:20] the second rule the second seed the
[44:22] second route
[44:24] so it's going to be a little bit
[44:25] interesting amen
[44:28] praise the lord because just like we did
[44:30] on sunday
[44:32] uh we there's we want to do
[44:35] likewise here uh uh
[44:38] this wednesday night to be able to show
[44:40] from the scripture
[44:42] that there's a reason why god placed
[44:45] two trees in the garden of eden
[44:51] praise the lord those two trees were
[44:54] representation
[44:58] are we together they were representation
[45:03] let's go back to genesis chapter
[45:06] two
[45:10] and uh i'm sure
[45:14] sure i have it here in my notes
[45:20] i didn't make mention about it genesis
[45:24] chapter 2 verse 9.
[45:30] genesis chapter 2 verse 9.
[45:34] now you have to be careful this is not
[45:36] this is not
[45:37] just trying to bring you information
[45:41] i'm not trying to bring you information
[45:43] because i know you know you know a lot
[45:45] of these things
[45:46] but what i'm trying to bring to you and
[45:48] i want for you to see
[45:50] is that we are in harvest time and every
[45:53] seed that was planted
[45:55] in the beginning is coming to its
[45:56] fullness
[45:59] that's what i want you to see
[46:04] wait this is harvest time
[46:08] every seed that was planted
[46:12] is coming to its harvest
[46:16] that's what jesus said in matthew
[46:18] chapter 13 we will get back to death
[46:22] in genesis chapter two
[46:28] verse 9 the bible said
[46:32] verse 8 and the lord god planted a god
[46:35] in east wall
[46:36] in eden and there he pulled the man whom
[46:39] he had
[46:40] formed and out
[46:43] of and out of the ground made the lord
[46:47] god
[46:48] to grow every tree that is
[46:51] pleasant in the sight and
[46:54] good for food now you will see
[46:58] that uh uh good for food there is uh
[47:03] a semi-colon there trying to
[47:06] separate it's in one sense is separating
[47:10] the trees that are good for food in the
[47:12] sense that
[47:13] all of those trees were natural trees
[47:16] that were good for food
[47:21] the tree of life also was in the midst
[47:24] of the gathering
[47:25] and the tree of knowledge good and evil
[47:31] so out of the ground the lord allowed
[47:34] every tree to grow that was good for
[47:36] food this one were
[47:38] the ones that were good for food but
[47:40] when it comes to the tree of life
[47:43] and the tree of knowledge good and evil
[47:45] they were there for
[47:47] [Music]
[47:50] representation
[47:55] praise the lord that's the reason why
[47:58] in the book of revelation retreat of
[48:00] life appeared again
[48:02] and now it's a book of life in
[48:04] revelation chapter
[48:06] 10 verse 8 you were given the book to
[48:08] eat the book
[48:12] praise the lord amen
[48:19] so i hope you see that you know every
[48:23] tree that was pleasant in
[48:24] to the side and good for food but then
[48:27] there were also two
[48:28] trees that were there and you can look
[48:32] through the structure
[48:33] and you see these
[48:36] two trees running parallel in different
[48:39] form
[48:40] we will talk more about that on sunday
[48:43] if the lord continued to lead us
[48:45] in that direction amen
[48:49] now uh
[48:55] as we look at this look at those those
[48:58] two
[48:58] trees that are there for for
[49:00] representation
[49:02] we will go now to uh
[49:05] matthew chapter
[49:11] matthew chapter 12. let's go to matthew
[49:14] chapter 12 before we start
[49:16] in matthew chapter 13. now you have to
[49:18] know that this is wednesday night amen
[49:20] so just just bear with me
[49:26] [Music]
[49:28] uh
[49:30] matthew chapter 12
[49:35] praise the lord now you have to realize
[49:39] here we will not be able to read
[49:41] everything over in matthew chapter 12.
[49:44] but
[49:44] there is there is something that happens
[49:48] in matthew chapter 12 that is very very
[49:52] important
[49:53] very very very important that i want
[49:57] to to kind of uh
[50:00] grab your attention in matthew chapter
[50:03] 12
[50:04] if you look here with me
[50:12] verse 22 then was brought unto him
[50:15] one possessed with a devil blind and
[50:18] dumb
[50:19] and he healed him in so much that the
[50:22] blind
[50:22] and the dumb both speak and saw
[50:26] and all the people were amazed
[50:29] and said is not this the son of david
[50:36] but when the pharisees heard it when the
[50:39] religious people heard it
[50:43] they said this fellow does not
[50:47] cast a devil but by bestiable
[50:50] the prince of the devils
[50:56] and jesus knew they had thought
[51:00] and said unto them every kingdom divided
[51:03] against itself
[51:04] is brought into desolation but this is
[51:06] what a way i want to grab
[51:08] you i mean grab our attention tonight is
[51:11] that
[51:12] this was this what happened right here
[51:17] changes jesus ministry from that time on
[51:22] because yeri said isaiah has prophesied
[51:26] the prophets of
[51:27] all uh the spirit of the law will be the
[51:29] palm main
[51:30] and you hear the brokenhearted and the
[51:32] lame the of the walk and all of
[51:34] those things
[51:35] and yes jesus right into his
[51:38] ministry and what he's done right before
[51:40] the people the bible says the
[51:42] brought a blind man and someone that
[51:44] cannot even speak and jesus
[51:47] pray for them and they are healed right
[51:49] there the
[51:50] the people are witness there's a group
[51:52] that say that looks
[51:53] at that and says and and they can be
[51:56] able to identify what has happened
[51:58] they can identify it with scripture
[52:02] amen there's a group that can be identif
[52:05] that can
[52:06] look at that and identify it with
[52:07] scripture and say is this
[52:09] not the son of david
[52:12] but on this other side the the religious
[52:16] leader of the dead they said no
[52:21] he i mean this man does not do no
[52:24] miracle except
[52:25] it is it is by the devil
[52:29] praise the lord now you will realize
[52:33] yet jesus talks a little bit you know
[52:36] has divided again himself he talks talks
[52:40] now you now watch what happened here let
[52:42] me go back to this
[52:44] the bible says and jesus knew they had
[52:47] thought
[52:49] amen so which means these religious
[52:52] leaders
[52:53] because of what they were taught in
[52:55] their council
[52:57] or what their churches have taught them
[53:00] they are standing there these people
[53:02] are uh are confessing oh man
[53:06] wow what a gift is this what a ministry
[53:08] is this
[53:09] and and here jesus is discerning the
[53:12] attacks
[53:16] praise the lord that's that's just how
[53:19] powerful
[53:20] your thoughts are brother branham said
[53:22] they speak loud lather in the presence
[53:24] of god and even your words
[53:28] jesus discerning their thoughts
[53:31] and saying that uh then he starts or
[53:34] says the
[53:35] arab kingdom divided against himself he
[53:38] said if satan cast
[53:39] a satan he went down he went down he
[53:41] went down
[53:43] now look at verse 38 the bible says
[53:46] then setting of the stripes and the
[53:48] pharisees
[53:49] answer saying master we will see a sign
[53:53] do you see that hypocrisy these very
[53:56] same people
[53:57] that were thinking in your mind that
[54:00] this
[54:00] guy is prince of the devil
[54:04] they are coming before him now trying to
[54:06] behave nice
[54:10] amen but you will see what happened what
[54:13] happened that i want to bring your
[54:14] attention to
[54:16] it is it is from this time jesus
[54:20] he uh he indicted that generation
[54:26] just like when brother brandon preached
[54:28] the message in death me
[54:32] from this time on
[54:35] jesus never spoke in public
[54:39] whenever he speaks in public he speaks
[54:42] in parables
[54:44] from this very time on so
[54:47] in another sense they have rejected the
[54:50] word
[54:53] they have rejected the word no matter
[54:55] how you cry
[54:57] over them no matter how you preach the
[54:59] word they have
[55:00] they have sealed their soul from
[55:02] receiving from god
[55:05] by the action of just sitting down they
[55:08] never say anything
[55:09] they were sitting down and thinking in
[55:11] their mind
[55:15] what is he doing down there just prince
[55:18] of the devil he just plain on the
[55:20] people's mind
[55:22] by that action they sealed themselves
[55:25] out of the kingdom of god
[55:31] and they are coming now to behave as
[55:33] safe to say they are nice as hell to say
[55:35] they are believing
[55:38] and they say master show us show us a
[55:41] sign
[55:42] jesus said no sign will be given to you
[55:46] a wicked and adulterous generation
[55:50] now you have to underline that because
[55:52] we'll be talking
[55:54] we we're talking about the serpent sea
[55:57] his roots
[55:58] and how it has spread out the tree that
[56:00] has grown and the fruit that is bad
[56:03] if a seed is planted and it starts
[56:05] taking root it has to bring up a tree
[56:10] and that tree has to bear fruit
[56:13] so we're going to go into a little bit
[56:15] tonight and he answered and said unto
[56:17] them an
[56:18] evil and adulterous generation seek for
[56:21] the sign and there will be no sign
[56:23] given unto them by the sign of the
[56:26] prophet jonah
[56:28] praise the lord now
[56:31] brings us to chapter 13.
[56:38] so chapter 13 show us
[56:42] the change in the ministry there was a
[56:44] junction of time
[56:48] when we get to chapter 13 jesus
[56:52] now he starts talking in parables
[56:58] you have to remember chapter 5 chapter 6
[57:02] jesus spoke unto them you are the light
[57:04] of the world you were not talking in
[57:06] parables
[57:07] he said if a man looked at a woman and
[57:09] lost after he were not talking in
[57:10] parables
[57:12] he was preaching his message plainly
[57:17] so you see there's one thing i want to
[57:19] bring out i want to bring to you tonight
[57:22] when the word of god is rejected
[57:27] praise the lord and you see right there
[57:31] in chapter 12 that's what jesus talked
[57:33] about
[57:34] blasphemy the son of god a sin that
[57:36] cannot be forgiven
[57:40] so you can see where jesus was in his
[57:43] ministry
[57:44] it was a junction of time
[57:49] where those people they would sit there
[57:52] they would not believe
[57:56] they have sealed themselves out of the
[57:58] kingdom of god by their
[58:00] attitude their attitude
[58:04] not to jesus to the world that was
[58:07] manifested
[58:08] before them because the healing of the
[58:11] sick
[58:12] opening the blind eyes it was the word
[58:14] of god that was promised for that day
[58:17] the world was made flesh before them
[58:25] and they took a wrong attitude the very
[58:27] same thing that king did
[58:31] and god said if you can go back and do
[58:33] like your brother abel
[58:36] well he walked away from the presence of
[58:38] the lord
[58:39] he rejected the correction of the word
[58:43] now we're talking about the
[58:46] seed of the wicked one
[58:50] that is one attribute that is wave
[58:54] the weaker one
[58:58] are we together praise the lord
[59:06] are we together tonight amen
[59:11] you grab the direction we are going in
[59:13] am i making you afraid
[59:17] praise the lord amen i hope we are
[59:20] identified into
[59:21] god's family tree on sunday if you
[59:23] identify into god's family tree you
[59:25] don't have to worry
[59:34] amen praise the lord
[59:43] there are some few uh
[59:58] are we together
[1:00:04] now if we get over to to
[1:00:08] uh uh chapter 13
[1:00:11] verse 10. jesus has finished talking
[1:00:15] about a parable some see fought on high
[1:00:17] ground some see fought in the tongues
[1:00:18] he finished saying all of that and the
[1:00:20] disciple came
[1:00:22] and said unto him why speak adele
[1:00:26] while speaketh they are unto them in
[1:00:29] parables
[1:00:32] they saw something changed in his
[1:00:34] ministry
[1:00:38] they noticed that something changed in
[1:00:41] his ministry
[1:00:46] praise the lord
[1:00:51] they notice it that something has
[1:00:53] changed in his ministry
[1:00:56] and he said unto them because it is
[1:00:59] giving unto you
[1:01:01] to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:01:05] but to them it is not giving
[1:01:10] praise the lord now even though that was
[1:01:13] not giving unto them it was not that
[1:01:14] moment that it was given to the
[1:01:16] disciples and not giving unto them it
[1:01:18] was something from the foundation of the
[1:01:19] world
[1:01:20] but you see the direct rejection to the
[1:01:22] word
[1:01:27] that was what brother branham explained
[1:01:30] in
[1:01:31] the the lamb and the dove story
[1:01:34] when brother branham says speaks about
[1:01:36] the the the scenario
[1:01:38] that the dove will take is flight it's
[1:01:41] not that the holy ghost leave and come
[1:01:43] back on you
[1:01:44] but if you are mad if you are not
[1:01:46] submitting to the word
[1:01:48] the holy ghost cannot work through you
[1:01:49] because the holy ghost can only work
[1:01:51] through the channel of the word
[1:01:57] are we together
[1:02:01] so the dove would take his flight in the
[1:02:04] sense that
[1:02:05] he would just be standing by there
[1:02:06] because he's i mean he's powerless until
[1:02:08] he has a body to work through
[1:02:13] until our will is submitted to him he's
[1:02:16] not going to struggle over you and your
[1:02:18] will
[1:02:22] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:02:24] the scripture says
[1:02:27] stubbornness is as witchcraft
[1:02:33] amen because what is happening there is
[1:02:36] that
[1:02:36] this person is expecting
[1:02:39] he and god to struggle over him
[1:02:44] he knows that the word that that
[1:02:48] the word condemned this thing he's being
[1:02:50] stubborn
[1:02:51] thinking that god will smack him and say
[1:02:53] stop doing it
[1:02:59] praise the lord are we together
[1:03:04] so there's a change in the ministry he
[1:03:07] says it is not giving unto them he says
[1:03:09] for
[1:03:09] for whosoever have to him it is giving
[1:03:14] and he shall have more abundantly into
[1:03:17] and but whosoever have met
[1:03:21] from him the little that he has we will
[1:03:23] even be taken from him
[1:03:25] it all comes to the rejection of the
[1:03:30] world
[1:03:31] the blasphemy of the holy ghost
[1:03:39] a person can be in that state all that
[1:03:42] will happen to you is that
[1:03:43] you will just be walking in intellect
[1:03:47] and there is nothing here giving you
[1:03:49] power to live
[1:03:51] what you are thinking
[1:03:55] you can argue the word you can argue the
[1:03:57] word called the code
[1:03:58] say the dead of the code called the city
[1:04:00] the message was preached in
[1:04:04] but you don't have the power here
[1:04:08] to live the word
[1:04:11] that's the reason why when god is
[1:04:13] dealing with our hearts
[1:04:18] we must speak here to it
[1:04:26] are we together
[1:04:29] so there's a change in the ministry the
[1:04:31] disciples saw it
[1:04:34] because now he pulled them down aside
[1:04:40] now everything that he said and see if
[1:04:42] sora went out to
[1:04:44] sow seeds and and all of that all of
[1:04:46] those things that he said
[1:04:49] he's now coming to explain it to the
[1:04:51] disciples
[1:04:53] now this is the very thing that the holy
[1:04:56] ghost
[1:04:57] does
[1:05:00] we can sit in the congregation the
[1:05:02] preacher can preach the word
[1:05:04] and move all over to the place and all
[1:05:06] over the place shouting we can we can
[1:05:08] sing we can rejoice in the in the
[1:05:10] preaching of the word
[1:05:15] but if you are not yelling to the holy
[1:05:17] ghost
[1:05:18] he will not follow you whom to teach you
[1:05:23] you will walk through those doors and
[1:05:26] when you go
[1:05:27] outside there you can even remember the
[1:05:30] message that was preached
[1:05:34] by the person that is yelling to the
[1:05:36] holy ghost the holy ghost go with you
[1:05:39] that word is on your mind when you go
[1:05:42] home
[1:05:43] you are meditating on the word he takes
[1:05:45] you back to the world this is what the
[1:05:47] preacher was talking about
[1:05:48] he's trying to make the world more
[1:05:50] clearer to you
[1:05:54] because there were things that he was
[1:05:56] saying
[1:05:57] that he could not say in the public
[1:06:06] are we together
[1:06:13] there are different forms of growth in
[1:06:16] the church
[1:06:20] there's a form of growth where we become
[1:06:23] many and it's a troubling form of growth
[1:06:28] too
[1:06:30] troubling form of growth because the
[1:06:31] scripture says the mixed multitude came
[1:06:33] at the time they were becoming many
[1:06:36] when three thousand were added to the
[1:06:38] church
[1:06:39] but there was there is another form of
[1:06:41] growth where the bible says
[1:06:43] they grew in the word of god
[1:06:50] praise the lord and it's that form of
[1:06:52] growth that i'm most interested in amen
[1:06:55] that we will grow in the word of god
[1:07:00] now so we see the change of the ministry
[1:07:02] year and
[1:07:03] jesus went on and on verse 18 let's take
[1:07:06] verse 18.
[1:07:09] year year therefore the parable of the
[1:07:12] sower
[1:07:14] what he was really saying now
[1:07:17] he has brought the disciples into the
[1:07:19] inner cycle
[1:07:20] listen to me carefully now
[1:07:24] listen to me this is what i was really
[1:07:26] preaching
[1:07:30] praise the lord amen
[1:07:33] you see that that is the reason why i
[1:07:35] believe
[1:07:37] you know even at the time brother
[1:07:38] branham was here this message
[1:07:40] was for the bride over and over brother
[1:07:44] branham will talk
[1:07:45] about uh uh maybe i'm just laying a
[1:07:48] platform
[1:07:48] for another one to come and many men has
[1:07:51] raising and they have claimed it
[1:07:53] if messengers and different ministries
[1:07:55] joshua and different things
[1:07:57] but the one that brother branham was
[1:07:58] talking about was the holy ghost
[1:08:02] it would be the holy ghost that would
[1:08:03] take this message
[1:08:05] and would be able to break the message
[1:08:07] down to the brine
[1:08:10] amen will be able to help the bride to
[1:08:13] feed on the world
[1:08:18] praise the lord so even at the time he
[1:08:22] was preaching
[1:08:22] all of those messages it was to the
[1:08:24] multitude
[1:08:25] because many of the people were there
[1:08:28] only for the manifestation of the gifts
[1:08:34] that's the reason why when that tear
[1:08:36] pool came and the world was open
[1:08:38] they said no there's something wrong
[1:08:40] with his teaching something wrong with
[1:08:42] his
[1:08:42] his daughtering brother brandon has to
[1:08:44] come back and he says
[1:08:46] i indebt this generation for crucifying
[1:08:49] jesus christ the second time
[1:08:51] you have rejected the word
[1:08:57] and like paul said it's a fearful thing
[1:09:00] to fall in the hands of the living god
[1:09:07] are we together now so jesus now take
[1:09:10] his disciples
[1:09:11] into the inner cycle and he says when
[1:09:14] any one of you hear the word of god
[1:09:17] and and understand it not
[1:09:20] then cometh the weaker one
[1:09:25] now watch this now watch this
[1:09:29] because there was a seed of the serpent
[1:09:33] in the beginning
[1:09:36] are we together there was a seed of the
[1:09:40] serpent
[1:09:41] in the beginning and
[1:09:44] uh brother branham was going to preach a
[1:09:47] message
[1:09:52] he just mentioned it before he passed
[1:09:54] away that's the only quote i have to
[1:09:55] read to you tonight
[1:09:57] part of transformation let's just read
[1:09:59] that
[1:10:00] and then we can go ahead
[1:10:06] he says here he says
[1:10:10] when i go home this time i'm preaching
[1:10:13] on this subject
[1:10:14] the trail of the serpent the beasts are
[1:10:18] the beginning
[1:10:20] and the beasts at the end
[1:10:24] and trail him right through the bible
[1:10:27] and show
[1:10:27] how he heads up
[1:10:32] amen praise the lord now you might agree
[1:10:36] and say well brother brethren did not
[1:10:37] preach
[1:10:38] preach that semen he said what you are
[1:10:39] going to preach
[1:10:41] the holy ghost is here
[1:10:44] praise the lord i'm not preaching what
[1:10:46] he's going to preach
[1:10:48] but i'm going to i'm saying that the
[1:10:50] holy ghost
[1:10:51] gave him an insight that we can trace
[1:10:54] the serpent by his trail
[1:10:59] we can trace the second by his trail
[1:11:02] because he have a seed
[1:11:06] and we know all his attributes is in his
[1:11:10] seed
[1:11:13] and because of that we can trust him
[1:11:19] and yeah in isaiah we find he got a root
[1:11:26] glory be to god amen
[1:11:39] are we together
[1:11:44] so jesus you will find this in matthew
[1:11:47] chapter 13
[1:11:48] maybe get home read it again you'll find
[1:11:51] he's he he keeps speaking this
[1:11:53] he keep using this word he says when one
[1:11:56] hears the word
[1:11:58] of the kingdom and understanding that
[1:12:01] then cometh the wicked one and he cashes
[1:12:05] away that which was saw
[1:12:09] in his heart
[1:12:12] this is he that received the seed by the
[1:12:15] wayside
[1:12:17] are we together
[1:12:36] i'm trying to get uh
[1:12:43] now let's let's drop down a little bit
[1:12:49] verse 24 another parable
[1:12:53] uh put heat forth unto them saying the
[1:12:56] kingdom of heaven is lacking unto a man
[1:12:58] that saw good seed in the field
[1:13:05] he's so goosey in the field
[1:13:08] but why man slept his enemy came
[1:13:11] and saw tears among the wheat and went
[1:13:15] away
[1:13:16] keep that principle also because we'll
[1:13:19] come back to that
[1:13:23] are we together
[1:13:35] verse 36
[1:13:42] let's read from verse 34.
[1:13:46] all these things jesus speak unto unto
[1:13:49] the multitudes in parable
[1:13:51] and without parable speak he
[1:13:54] net unto them
[1:13:58] from that time whenever he speaks to the
[1:14:01] multitude
[1:14:02] he speaks to them in parable
[1:14:05] and without parable because
[1:14:09] it is it is at a place where the world
[1:14:13] was just
[1:14:14] water on the dock's back
[1:14:20] it was just putting a a
[1:14:24] piece before swamps
[1:14:28] so he speaks in parables
[1:14:34] now it might be fulfilled which was
[1:14:36] spoken by the prophet
[1:14:37] saying i will open my mouth in parables
[1:14:41] and i will alter things which
[1:14:45] have been kept secret from the
[1:14:48] foundation of the word
[1:14:50] so secret from the foundation of the
[1:14:52] word this is all tied
[1:14:54] into the mysteries that was in the back
[1:14:57] part of god's mind
[1:15:03] are we together
[1:15:07] then jesus sent a multitude away
[1:15:11] and went into the house and his
[1:15:13] disciples came unto him saying
[1:15:15] declared unto us the parables of the
[1:15:18] tires of the field
[1:15:21] and he answered and said unto them he
[1:15:23] that
[1:15:24] saw the good seed is
[1:15:27] the son of man he that saw the good sea
[1:15:32] is the son of man praise the lord
[1:15:37] the good seed will be tied to
[1:15:40] the tree of life
[1:15:43] we will go we will get into death
[1:15:47] the field is the word the entire world
[1:15:50] this entire world now you have to know
[1:15:53] that jesus here is saying
[1:15:56] that these things were mysteries
[1:16:00] from the foundation of the word
[1:16:03] just like how we talk about god watching
[1:16:06] over you four generation
[1:16:10] before you got here those things were in
[1:16:13] the mind of god you didn't know about it
[1:16:16] your grandfather didn't know about it
[1:16:20] amen they were all in god's mind
[1:16:28] praise the lord
[1:16:34] the good seed are the children of the
[1:16:37] kingdom
[1:16:39] the good seed are the children of the
[1:16:42] kingdom
[1:16:43] the good seed is planted by the son of
[1:16:46] man
[1:16:46] the son of man plant the children of the
[1:16:50] kingdom
[1:16:52] praise the lord that is the reason why
[1:16:55] in every age
[1:16:56] god sent a messenger and there are a
[1:16:59] predestinated people to receive his
[1:17:02] message
[1:17:06] praise the lord
[1:17:10] amen
[1:17:13] the son of man plant the good sea
[1:17:17] the good seas are the children of the
[1:17:20] kingdom
[1:17:26] are we together tonight
[1:17:30] but the thirds are the children of
[1:17:34] the weaker one again he's using the
[1:17:37] wicked one
[1:17:42] amen the thirds are the children
[1:17:45] of the wicked one
[1:17:50] now you see this this will make
[1:17:53] the subject of sepancy more clearer to
[1:17:56] you
[1:18:01] praise the lord because when we talk
[1:18:04] about the seventh seed
[1:18:07] and and we talk on the subject of the
[1:18:09] separate we run straight to the book of
[1:18:11] first
[1:18:12] john you are jumping over an
[1:18:15] entire dispensation
[1:18:18] that's why brother branham says here the
[1:18:20] serpent at the beginning can be traced
[1:18:22] to the end
[1:18:24] now if you can trace him find his root
[1:18:26] in isaiah
[1:18:29] and see him here as a third over in
[1:18:32] matthew chapter 13
[1:18:36] praise the lord
[1:18:41] are we together
[1:18:49] the third are the children of the wicked
[1:18:51] one
[1:18:52] the enemy that saw them
[1:18:55] is the devil so the devil year
[1:18:58] he's now connected to the third that is
[1:19:02] the children of the wicked one
[1:19:04] as the son of man is connected to the
[1:19:07] good sea
[1:19:08] that are the children of the kingdom
[1:19:13] the two trees that was in eden is now
[1:19:17] appearing before us here in eden
[1:19:20] we would think that they were literal
[1:19:21] trees but here jesus now is identifying
[1:19:24] those trees
[1:19:25] as persons
[1:19:31] praise the lord now if you go to the
[1:19:34] book of
[1:19:35] isaiah if you go to the book of isaiah
[1:19:38] and study isaiah chapter 13 and 14
[1:19:44] how are they falling o lucifer before
[1:19:47] isaiah got to death
[1:19:48] isaiah was talking about babylon
[1:19:56] so that seed that started in eden
[1:20:00] its roots reigned through babylon
[1:20:02] started with mira
[1:20:04] or we can get into the history tonight
[1:20:06] i'm just trying to
[1:20:07] to lay some things down amen
[1:20:15] you will see just like there were two
[1:20:17] trees
[1:20:20] in eden there were two cherubims
[1:20:23] over the ark of the covenant there were
[1:20:26] two nations
[1:20:27] that were that are generally used over
[1:20:29] and over in the scripture babylon
[1:20:32] and the new jerusalem
[1:20:44] are we together tonight praise the lord
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:53] okay it's wednesday night we just have a
[1:20:55] few minutes
[1:20:57] but let's just fellowship together
[1:20:58] tonight amen
[1:21:00] praise the lord the enemy that saw them
[1:21:05] is the devil the harvest
[1:21:08] is the end of the word the angel the
[1:21:12] the the reapers are the angels which are
[1:21:14] the messengers that's what brother
[1:21:16] branham said
[1:21:17] he says those angels were the messengers
[1:21:20] in uh in harvest time when he preached
[1:21:23] the message harvest time that's what he
[1:21:25] said
[1:21:25] so we we see here that jesus
[1:21:28] giving this to us uh
[1:21:33] want to be able to take up uh a little
[1:21:36] bit here
[1:21:37] before we get we get uh
[1:21:41] first john chapter one
[1:21:44] no first john chapter two first john
[1:21:48] chapter two we will follow this wicked
[1:21:51] one a little bit
[1:21:53] because you have to realize now we we
[1:21:55] are talking about the other tree
[1:21:58] amen and now the other tree
[1:22:02] is now taking on an identification year
[1:22:05] of
[1:22:06] producing fruit that are
[1:22:09] the weaker one
[1:22:13] are we together
[1:22:21] speaking of fruits that are identified
[1:22:25] with the wicked one
[1:22:28] first john chapter 2
[1:22:37] first john chapter 2.
[1:22:43] let's read from verse 12 first john
[1:22:45] chapter 2 verse 12.
[1:22:48] this is our our our youth
[1:22:51] youth meetings uh one of our youth
[1:22:54] meeting verse
[1:22:55] verses i write unto you little children
[1:22:58] because your sins are forgiving
[1:23:04] because your sins are forgiving
[1:23:07] you for his name's sake i write unto you
[1:23:11] fathers because ye have known him
[1:23:15] that is from the beginning i write unto
[1:23:18] you
[1:23:19] young men because yay
[1:23:22] have overcome the weaker one
[1:23:32] yeah the weaker one appear again now
[1:23:35] so you will realize here this is not
[1:23:39] just this is not just a thought
[1:23:44] as the seed runs from the beginning
[1:23:49] as the sea runs from the beginning
[1:23:53] is is is becoming personalized
[1:23:58] praise the lord and yeah
[1:24:02] john is now identifying his
[1:24:06] is because right here that's where john
[1:24:09] talks about the manifestation
[1:24:11] of the sons of god he said for this
[1:24:13] reason the son of god was manifested to
[1:24:15] destroy the works of the devil
[1:24:17] so right here now we realize that
[1:24:20] it will as we read on you we see pretty
[1:24:24] soon
[1:24:24] that it just is more than just
[1:24:28] a concept
[1:24:31] amen is more than just a concept
[1:24:36] it's a spirit it's a spirit
[1:24:40] that the lies this church is going to
[1:24:43] fight against
[1:24:45] it's a spirit that the inlet is going to
[1:24:48] fight against
[1:24:52] and i mean when we say we are overcomers
[1:24:55] in laodicea
[1:24:57] is because we have overcome the wicked
[1:24:59] one
[1:25:02] now by joining church
[1:25:05] amen not by joining church because when
[1:25:08] john talks about a year
[1:25:10] he says young man because you have
[1:25:12] overcome the wicked one
[1:25:13] i write unto you my little children
[1:25:15] because you have known the father
[1:25:18] and i have read him unto you father
[1:25:20] because he have known him
[1:25:22] that is from the beginning i read it
[1:25:24] unto you again young men
[1:25:26] because you are strong
[1:25:29] and the word of god abireth in you
[1:25:33] and ye have overcome the wicked one oh
[1:25:36] my goodness
[1:25:38] now i feel like preaching amen
[1:25:41] glory be to god the word of god about it
[1:25:44] in you
[1:25:44] is the word that overcomes the wicked
[1:25:52] one
[1:25:54] see the importance of revelation
[1:25:57] 10 verse 8 eat the word
[1:26:02] i'm not talking to you
[1:26:06] praise the lord
[1:26:14] seriously i'm talking to her amen
[1:26:20] i'm waiting for the day where she would
[1:26:22] say amen
[1:26:24] then i know that the word has entered
[1:26:27] you
[1:26:29] praise the lord amen
[1:26:34] so you see it you see how we have how we
[1:26:36] are tracing the second this way
[1:26:40] we are following the trace of the
[1:26:48] serpent because you see when you talk
[1:26:51] about the
[1:26:51] the the subject on the seventh seed
[1:26:54] people just think it's brother brandon
[1:26:56] brother branham doctrine it's it's the
[1:26:58] word of god
[1:27:02] and the reason why that mystery was
[1:27:06] important we would have never overcome
[1:27:09] if we did not know the two different
[1:27:11] seed
[1:27:13] and to be able to identify which scene
[1:27:16] you are
[1:27:17] that's the thing that makes you to
[1:27:18] overcome
[1:27:27] the teaching of discrepancy is not just
[1:27:30] to make a
[1:27:32] uh you know a mysterious acceptance
[1:27:35] it's not all about what took place in
[1:27:37] the garden of eden
[1:27:38] the garden of eden is just a new part of
[1:27:41] it
[1:27:42] but to be able to trace that serpent
[1:27:44] down to our time
[1:27:47] in our day
[1:27:51] my goodness when we get in this thing
[1:27:54] you will realize that
[1:27:55] we need to be on our toes we need to be
[1:27:58] in business with god
[1:28:00] there's no time to play church because i
[1:28:03] will tell you i will confess
[1:28:04] one thing to you now this your flesh is
[1:28:07] a birth of the wicked one
[1:28:13] oh yeah we got to bring it home
[1:28:18] because we are getting ready to get out
[1:28:19] of here
[1:28:28] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:28:30] jeremiah
[1:28:32] crusade the heart is desperately wicked
[1:28:38] the heart is desperately weakened by our
[1:28:40] first birth
[1:28:42] wickedness comes very close
[1:28:45] and where is the predestination of god
[1:28:47] in your soul
[1:28:48] where is your soul in your heart it
[1:28:50] comes very close to it
[1:28:59] and sometimes people think they have too
[1:29:03] hot
[1:29:03] my other heart says i should do i say no
[1:29:06] the other hearts say i shouldn't do it
[1:29:10] praise the lord you're only having one
[1:29:12] heart but there is weakness on one side
[1:29:16] and the seed of god on the other side
[1:29:22] praise the lord and that's what the holy
[1:29:25] ghost comes to do
[1:29:26] to burn that serpent that is down there
[1:29:29] that's what the baptising of the holy
[1:29:30] ghost does
[1:29:31] it burned our serpent
[1:29:42] are we together
[1:29:50] to be able to enjoy the fullness of our
[1:29:54] salvation the joy of our salvation
[1:29:57] to be able to enjoy our redemption
[1:30:03] we got to put that serpent on fire
[1:30:07] praise the lord
[1:30:10] when that serpent is burned
[1:30:13] it's hard for your tongue to tell lies
[1:30:17] you don't have desires and gossips
[1:30:22] amen you wouldn't love to build people
[1:30:25] up not to tear them down
[1:30:37] young man you have overcome the word
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:41] praise the lord amen i love the way he
[1:30:44] said
[1:30:45] he already unto you fathers because they
[1:30:47] have knew him
[1:30:48] from the beginning i've read it unto you
[1:30:50] young men
[1:30:52] young people because you are strong
[1:30:56] and the word of god abide in you just
[1:30:58] last week we were talking about the
[1:31:00] abiding presence
[1:31:04] that comes with his word and his name
[1:31:07] take the name of jesus with you wherever
[1:31:09] where you go
[1:31:12] because it's the word but branham said
[1:31:15] why we we have read that to you over and
[1:31:17] over
[1:31:18] it's not the it's not the person that
[1:31:20] comes predestinated
[1:31:22] it is not you that comes predestinated
[1:31:24] is the word of god
[1:31:26] that is predestinated for this age to
[1:31:28] have sons and daughters
[1:31:34] it's the word that comes predestinated
[1:31:39] and that word quickens the word in you
[1:31:44] you see your name in the book and you
[1:31:46] say amen to the word of god
[1:31:48] are we together praise the lord
[1:31:52] having a few minutes here now let's just
[1:31:54] wrap up on this on this on this wicked
[1:31:56] one
[1:31:58] a little bit here the chapter three
[1:32:01] let's look at chapter three
[1:32:12] verse 11 for this
[1:32:15] is the message for this
[1:32:19] is the message i preached this one time
[1:32:22] somewhere i can remember where was that
[1:32:24] this is the message you see the message
[1:32:26] we are in the message this is the
[1:32:28] message
[1:32:30] this is the message to overcome the
[1:32:33] weaker one
[1:32:34] is the message to be in fellowship with
[1:32:36] god
[1:32:37] is the message to walk in the light as
[1:32:40] he is in the light
[1:32:41] and the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:32:43] us that is the message
[1:32:53] for this is the message that we have
[1:32:55] heard
[1:32:56] from the beginning the message from the
[1:32:59] beginning
[1:33:00] this is the same john that said in the
[1:33:02] beginning was the word
[1:33:03] the word was with god and the word was
[1:33:05] god he's always sending us back to the
[1:33:08] beginning
[1:33:09] because genesis is the c chapter
[1:33:16] amen is the c chapter
[1:33:21] this is the message that we have heard
[1:33:24] from the beginning
[1:33:25] that we should love one another not as
[1:33:29] king who is of
[1:33:33] that wicked one
[1:33:38] praise the lord now you see
[1:33:42] if you if you just if you just take this
[1:33:45] scripture or take this verse
[1:33:47] and tie it to to genesis chapter 3
[1:33:51] without finding the succession of voices
[1:33:54] that progress
[1:33:55] to these words you are making
[1:33:59] king the sea of the serpent
[1:34:02] praise the lord and you are just living
[1:34:05] it like that you you cannot be able to
[1:34:07] trace it
[1:34:09] john the baptist came he rebuked his
[1:34:12] generation
[1:34:13] he says you are bruised serpents
[1:34:18] he called them serpents not because he
[1:34:21] never had vocabulary to
[1:34:22] to uh to preach to them he called them
[1:34:25] serpent because
[1:34:26] that was what was happening
[1:34:30] the root of the serpent has has spread
[1:34:32] out into religion
[1:34:35] the root of the serpent was uh has
[1:34:38] spread out into judaism
[1:34:42] that the people were following
[1:34:44] traditions
[1:34:46] they were following traditions instead
[1:34:48] of identifying the word of god
[1:34:51] when jesus came he did the same thing he
[1:34:54] called them serpent you are of your
[1:34:56] father the devil
[1:35:05] are we together
[1:35:14] the only thing genesis chapter 3 brings
[1:35:17] out for
[1:35:18] us it helped us to find
[1:35:22] the missing link
[1:35:26] and how do we find the missing link
[1:35:28] because the second was upright
[1:35:30] he was not a raptor
[1:35:34] so genesis 3 show us the missing link
[1:35:38] and the next thing that genesis 3
[1:35:41] revealed to us
[1:35:42] is the mix of blood
[1:35:46] that manga the serpent seed
[1:35:50] into the sons of god
[1:35:56] so it's hard now for you to find it
[1:36:02] that's what brandon says our flesh
[1:36:05] is was breeded between the serpent and
[1:36:07] eve
[1:36:09] because of the fall that's why we had to
[1:36:11] be born
[1:36:12] by natural birth
[1:36:15] so you can't just look at a man by his
[1:36:18] hair cut and say you are serpenty
[1:36:23] oh because a man is wearing necktie and
[1:36:26] glory to god
[1:36:27] he said yeah he's a seed of god
[1:36:31] we have seen many seed of god that have
[1:36:33] turned their back on the message
[1:36:37] praise the lord and even if they fall
[1:36:39] from the mess you still can't call them
[1:36:41] serpentine
[1:36:42] why because there is still blood on the
[1:36:45] throne
[1:36:50] so don't be looking for serpent sea all
[1:36:52] over the place
[1:36:53] be looking to bring the serpent from
[1:36:55] here
[1:36:58] be looking to kick the serpent out of
[1:36:59] this body
[1:37:03] praise the lord
[1:37:07] glory be to god
[1:37:12] now that's king who
[1:37:16] was of that wicked one and he slayed his
[1:37:18] brother
[1:37:20] and whosoever's and and and whosoever
[1:37:23] slayed him because his own works with
[1:37:26] evil
[1:37:27] and his brother works was righteous
[1:37:32] praise the lord he says marvin that
[1:37:35] brethren
[1:37:37] if the world hits you we know that
[1:37:41] we have passed from death onto life
[1:37:44] you know so yeah he's he's he's dealing
[1:37:47] he's dealing
[1:37:48] also with with with hatred
[1:37:51] or hatred why should you hate a person
[1:37:54] why
[1:37:56] why should you hit a person
[1:38:03] praise the lord
[1:38:06] having the ability to be able to
[1:38:09] separate a person from the wrong
[1:38:13] you can hit the wrong
[1:38:20] but with the love of god in your heart
[1:38:22] you will you always love that person
[1:38:25] you will love and wish that they can be
[1:38:28] safe
[1:38:39] are we together
[1:38:43] praise the lord i was listening to
[1:38:48] to uh to a scallop
[1:38:51] and uh one famous bible teacher
[1:38:56] and he was there on genesis and talking
[1:38:59] about how those angels
[1:39:01] genesis chapter 6 the sons of god saw
[1:39:04] the daughter of man
[1:39:05] and his i mean in his fighting in his
[1:39:08] mind
[1:39:09] trying to prove that the sons of god
[1:39:11] were injurious
[1:39:16] amen and he's he's uh
[1:39:20] he's he's proving it with all all the
[1:39:23] the mysterious thing he's trying to
[1:39:24] bring in my mind
[1:39:26] i'm saying these scholars
[1:39:30] they will struggle to believe that the
[1:39:32] serpent
[1:39:36] amen that the devil became the serpent
[1:39:39] in genesis 3.
[1:39:43] they would struggle with that but they
[1:39:45] came mystified and
[1:39:47] tried to make it mysterious how falling
[1:39:50] angels came down
[1:39:55] now watch the deception here when they
[1:39:58] talk about these falling angels that
[1:40:00] came down
[1:40:01] and saw the daughters of men what do
[1:40:04] they say
[1:40:05] that says they went after the daughters
[1:40:07] of men and they have children
[1:40:09] and those children were giants
[1:40:12] but they would not see that the serpent
[1:40:16] also had children with eve
[1:40:21] when you bring there they argue about it
[1:40:22] no no no no no the bible didn't say that
[1:40:25] the bible never even said angels
[1:40:29] and even if we want to take the place of
[1:40:31] angels
[1:40:32] jesus said we will be like angels
[1:40:35] erasing the sex glance
[1:40:36] angels don't have sex claims just that
[1:40:39] scripture
[1:40:40] in the new testament erased the fact
[1:40:43] that it was angers
[1:40:45] that came down because angels do not
[1:40:48] have sex claims
[1:40:54] but bring them to to serpenty you can
[1:40:57] show them you can lay the word out to
[1:41:00] them
[1:41:01] they can see it why because it was not
[1:41:03] given to them to see
[1:41:06] that is the reason why you don't
[1:41:07] struggle to make somebody to see
[1:41:11] it was not given to them to see it
[1:41:24] you love the lord tonight oh we are
[1:41:27] blessed people
[1:41:29] we should be having happy faces even
[1:41:32] beyond the max we should know how to
[1:41:34] smile
[1:41:35] even behind the max praise the lord
[1:41:40] even behind the max no mask you hold our
[1:41:43] smile back
[1:41:45] praise the lord
[1:41:49] glory be to god because we have what it
[1:41:52] takes
[1:41:55] to be happy there are some things that
[1:41:58] we have gone into night
[1:42:01] and deal with that that seen nature
[1:42:05] deal with weakness
[1:42:09] that's some of the highest form of
[1:42:11] weakness for a person
[1:42:13] to come to the house of god and don't
[1:42:16] receive from god
[1:42:22] come to the house of god and don't
[1:42:25] receive from god come to the house of
[1:42:27] god
[1:42:31] and i mean and don't receive the word
[1:42:36] come to the house of god and sleep
[1:42:39] that wickiness
[1:42:43] it might sound funny but that's
[1:42:45] wickedness
[1:42:47] is the wicked one that is getting at you
[1:42:51] and like i've always said the most
[1:42:54] spiritual person is the one that stands
[1:42:56] up
[1:42:57] you go back there and you fight that
[1:42:59] devil
[1:43:02] he's not the one that is trying to be
[1:43:04] smart oh yeah amen
[1:43:15] glory be to god
[1:43:19] first john chapter five let's just take
[1:43:21] one more and then we close for the night

[1:43:31] home and read and
[1:43:33] study those of you that have taken notes
[1:43:36] to study
[1:43:40] this is a serious business
[1:43:44] praise the lord
[1:43:50] but we will get we'll get into it we get
[1:43:53] more into it
[1:43:54] as we as we go along i don't know if we
[1:43:58] will
[1:43:58] continue on sunday or maybe on uh
[1:44:02] on another time
[1:44:06] you know when i get into this series
[1:44:08] it's hard to get out of here man
[1:44:10] i'm having a lot of on end their series
[1:44:13] i got to get back to the book of acts
[1:44:14] amen
[1:44:17] oh praise the lord now now first john
[1:44:20] chapter 5 verse 18 let's
[1:44:22] let's read this one together tonight
[1:44:24] just try to bring a little bible studies
[1:44:26] here for us to be able to get this thing
[1:44:28] into some uh
[1:44:31] good perspective and see the things that
[1:44:33] we are dealing with
[1:44:36] see the things we are dealing with that
[1:44:37] will bring out uh some things for us to
[1:44:40] talk about
[1:44:41] you know verse 18
[1:44:45] first john chapter 5 verse 18 we know
[1:44:49] that whosoever is born of god seen it
[1:44:52] not but he
[1:44:56] that is begotten of god
[1:44:59] keepeth himself and the wicked one
[1:45:04] touched him net
[1:45:09] praise the lord
[1:45:12] and we know that we are of god
[1:45:17] and the whole word
[1:45:20] the whole word
[1:45:25] the cosmos of this world liareth
[1:45:28] in wickedness
[1:45:33] another thing another scripture that
[1:45:35] proves to us
[1:45:36] that satan is the god of this evil age
[1:45:40] the whole world liarette in
[1:45:43] weakness all of these things
[1:45:47] running campaigning uh uh we don't have
[1:45:50] no scriptural
[1:45:52] uh uh uh a candidate
[1:45:57] i don't care what you think the reason
[1:45:59] is because
[1:46:01] god always ordained like the bible said
[1:46:04] a government
[1:46:05] is ordained of god
[1:46:08] to whip the people back when the church
[1:46:11] has filled
[1:46:12] the people
[1:46:16] praise the lord because if the church
[1:46:18] were keeping the people in the word of
[1:46:20] god
[1:46:22] amen if they were keeping the standard
[1:46:25] of the word of god
[1:46:26] not turning the word of god into a
[1:46:28] nightclub or with all of these disco
[1:46:30] lighting
[1:46:30] and all of the things that they are
[1:46:32] preaching keeping the people
[1:46:34] back to bible standards we will not have
[1:46:38] the bunch of divorce problems that we
[1:46:40] have keeping the people back to bible
[1:46:42] standards we will not have
[1:46:43] a bunch of young people all in the
[1:46:45] streets
[1:46:48] because the church has failed so god
[1:46:51] will always raise
[1:46:52] up a leader
[1:46:55] praise the lord that's why the
[1:46:58] government that's that's the thing that
[1:46:59] makes the government a dean of god
[1:47:01] god is he does not have no political
[1:47:05] party god does not have political party
[1:47:10] you want to make one party a god party
[1:47:12] in the other party devil party that's
[1:47:14] not the message i'm preaching here
[1:47:15] tonight
[1:47:20] the whole world lyreth in wickedness
[1:47:29] oh i can go on tonight i'm i'm just just
[1:47:34] that now say i feel like preaching here
[1:47:36] man
[1:47:38] i've exhausted my time already amen
[1:47:43] musicians you can come for tonight amen
[1:47:47] you can come for tonight the whole world
[1:47:50] larith in wickedness
[1:47:55] saints of god brothers and sisters
[1:48:00] but we have a kingdom
[1:48:03] we have a kingdom coming
[1:48:10] that's the reason why we have to mean
[1:48:11] business with god
[1:48:14] we have young people that need to be
[1:48:16] born again and need a true experience of
[1:48:19] the holy ghost
[1:48:21] we cannot give them any substitute
[1:48:24] because
[1:48:24] god is still god
[1:48:28] praise the lord
[1:48:31] we have young people going into marriage
[1:48:33] and and and trying to raise a family
[1:48:35] in this whole world alert in wickedness
[1:48:40] we don't have a cornerstone with god
[1:48:47] we would think that all of the things
[1:48:48] that have been preached to all out of
[1:48:49] the years were just lies
[1:48:51] because that's what people say they come
[1:48:53] to that place we believe this thing and
[1:48:55] it is not real
[1:48:56] it is the problem is not the word the
[1:48:58] problem is our attitude
[1:49:00] to the word because the word of god
[1:49:05] is alive the word of god is real
[1:49:09] let's buy our house together tonight
[1:49:12] let's buy our house together tonight
[1:49:14] we can go home and do the rest of the
[1:49:16] praying you think about the things we
[1:49:18] say
[1:49:18] the whole world larath and weakness and
[1:49:20] all of the things
[1:49:22] uh uh spiritual battles you know what
[1:49:24] the god of this evil age warring against
[1:49:26] us and all of that we have to take our
[1:49:29] stand with the world if god
[1:49:31] has given us grace he has opened our
[1:49:33] eyes to the world he's dealing with our
[1:49:35] heart
[1:49:35] don't take it for granted don't think
[1:49:38] that oh yeah you know you can come back
[1:49:40] anytime and get the same experience with
[1:49:42] god if god is dealing with you
[1:49:43] give your heart to god submit yourself
[1:49:45] to god
[1:49:49] the holy ghost is not a guess you can't
[1:49:52] guess the holy ghost
[1:49:56] people say oh i received the whole we
[1:49:57] need the holy ghost every day of our
[1:49:59] life we need a refilling that's why
[1:50:01] brother branham said the dynamics of
[1:50:03] this church
[1:50:03] would be the refilling of the holy ghost
[1:50:06] we need
[1:50:06] the baptism of the holy ghost every
[1:50:08] service we come talk we must experience
[1:50:11] a refreshing from god
