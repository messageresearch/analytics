it's such a blessing to be a christian in the dead and age that we live amen amen praise the lord to realize how how dark the word is and to know that you are the light of the world amen praise the lord to know that you are the light of the world let's read isaiah chapter 61. i would just want to use that for the scripture reading and just to bring out the kind of a context of what we want to speak on uh this morning isaiah chapter 61 the spirit of the lord god is upon me because he have anointed me to preach good tidings onto the meek he has sent me to bind up the broken heart to to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the praising to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable yet of the lord and the day of virgins of our god to comfort all that mourn the scripture don't ends there a continuum to appoint unto them they are moan in zion to give unto them beauty for arches the lord of joy for mourning the government of praise for the spirit of heaviness a brother sent me the text yesterday insists and says uh you know i think he sent it out to some ministers and said brazilians can you pray for me i'm just feeling so tired i don't know what so i taught on this scripture and i sent it back to him and said brother i just think it's the spirit of heaviness and we have to rebuke it amen all you have to do just wear your garment of praise take a hallelujah shoes of dancing told you i said just wear the gum in the praise take a hallelujah shoes of dancing and that devil will go flying amen praise the lord amen to the point unto them the morning zion to give them beautiful arches the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness now if you realize this is under the second portion of that prophecy [Music] the second portion the people honor the day of virgin supposed to be enjoying these blessings because the prophecy is breaking two there is the acceptable year and the second part of the prophecy is the day of virgins so in the day of virgins which is the judgment of the word god is going to pose such a spirit on his people and and and that's and that's going to be our blessing he's going to give us a beautiful arches amen praise the lord and and and uh the the beauty of lord the beauty of the lord is the spirit of holiness that is upon his people and he's going to give us lord of joy for mourning he will give a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness with all of the demon power and evil spirit will be dealing with in this in this day if you can just know how to praise god i'm telling you you're going to break through complaining is not going to help you amen you can complain about the president complaining about the political party complaining about the governor is not going to help you it's the spirit of the age praise the lord find the government of praise and the hallelujah shoes of dancing glory be to god amen the government of praise for the spirit of heaviness that there might be called a tree of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified amen luke chapter 4 let's turn there are we together luke chapter four let's uh let's read from verse 14 and jesus return in the power of the spirit into gathering and there went out a friend of him throughout all the region round about and he taught in the ascendants being glorified of all and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went he went into the synagogues on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was deliver unto him the book of the prophet desire and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written just where we just read so jesus went back over to isaiah chapter 61. he opened that place where it is just read the spirit of the lord is upon me because he have anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the cottage and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord then the bible says and he closed the book so which means he broke the prophecies into two he just read one part of the prophecy and then he left the other one and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and his and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogues were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this dead is this scripture fulfilled in your ears let us pray together heavenly father we just want to thank you oh god the lord we are living in a day where scriptures are fulfilled not only in our hearing lord but even in our eyes lord we can see the days and the time before us we can see the how men are consumed with violence evil has come upon the earth never like before precious lord we all god but we we are also grateful that we are living in a dead father lord where the spirit of grace have come upon the people oh god the people father lord the lord despite god father of our needs our bills and our our struggle law there is just a desire in our heart to rise above all of these laws there is a constant desire in our heart lord to live better than the day yesterday and there's a desire oh god to save you father better lord than we are doing oh god we know it is a spirit of grace that you have pulled upon us so father so we are grateful for precious lord almighty god we just want to ask your blessings upon the word now god father we have an inspiration on our heart but we pray that the holy spirit that know the needs of the people will come with god take your word father lord god you can trash my thoughts lord you can trash my notes and trash my inspiration and god just come and minister to the needs of your people this morning because you are more than able father we are not serving the historical god we are serving the same yesterday today and forever we are serving the present tense god we are serving the resurrected lord jesus christ oh god so we pray father come lord jesus possess our being this morning lord we take every spirit every mind oh father for your glory this morning lord in the name of jesus christ blessed be your holy name in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen amen the scripture we we just read is is very familiar to to uh to many of us praise the lord very familiar but i read that this morning just just to uh uh create a picture or use that as a scripture reading because i really didn't have one amen the reason i didn't have one is because uh uh there there just there were just a lot of things that is before us this morning and we want to trust and see how the grace of god will be able to bring us through those things amen praise the lord and that wednesday night we had a prayer meeting and uh and just for an exhortation we spoke uh how paul uh referred to the believers and sees knowing that that ye are the temple of the living god amen and where god dwelleth in you we read that and then we read also from from the book of revelation where jesus referred to a certain group of men as certain impersonators you know these guys were imposters they were uh and and jesus referred to them as the synagogues of satan so we were looking at men being the temple of god and men being the synagogues of satan so uh we were just we were just looking at the other uh you know and and that's that's the thing about the word of god is is uh uh when you go when you go just stretching into one verse you might bomb into an entire book and then you go reading that book you might get into a you know one verse might get you into an entire chapter the chapter will get you into an entire book praise the lord so uh with that total mind we were thinking this morning how we will we will come back to that and you know and from the world be able to show you know how we are living in the day of manifestation we are living in the dead you know god god highest form of expression is to be made flesh praise the lord you know just like we spoke about that little baby that is that was born killed and then a little and after a while he started becoming a troubled boy but you know what the father waits for is to see when he grows to be mentioned it grows to the age of maturity what he would become you know he being a little cute baby he being a troublesome boy you know he being you know that smart teenager will matter nothing when it comes to that time of his maturity praise the lord because you see when god made man in the beginning god never made a baby man he never made a teenage boy when he made man he made man in a manchester state he made him and he adopted him and said take dominion praise the lord so that is the highest form of expression when we come to maturity praise the lord when we comes to maturity that's what the father looks for are we together praise the lord so we are in we are in such a time of uh of of of of manifestation we we are in an age where we we are realizing you know the bible the bible speaks about uh you know a man of sin the man that would be be fully possessed by the devil just like jesus christ was god in flesh there will be a man that will be fully possessed by the spirit of the devil he will be he will be satan in flesh amen but but yet in in and just like our lord jesus christ was was god in flesh we are also coming to the place where we have we have sons and daughters of god that are also uh in the embodiment of the spirit of god and we also you know living in an age where we are seeing uh you know uh people that have just been overtaken by the devil amen praise the lord wickedness and violence just just just brewed in their hearts and mind what a blood-seeking generation that we are living in amen not a day that goes by without the blood being shared on this earth praise the lord it's a horrible horrible generation that we are living in that's the reason why we are grateful that we are christians amen because the most saviors place to be is to be in christ that is the only savior's place and the only future that this world have is the coming millennium this world does not have no future by the coming millennium praise the lord amen what jesus will reign amen and satan will be bound for the thousand years my goodness you will go a thousand years without one evil taught there will not be one illness in your body is that not a future to look for at all praise the lord then to be hoping for an uncertain future praise the lord a thousand years mine what are you going to do are you making plans what are you going to do with a thousand years on your hands praise the lord well yeah let's let's look forward to it because god said it amen and it's going to be it's going to come to pass praise the lord amen blessed be the name of the lord amen hallelujah so with with that with that being said uh [Music] i thought i will i will go back to uh to talking about uh the temple of god the the synagogues of satan but i will i would just trust that the law will be able to help us because uh might be going in in i would just be all over the place amen so you take the steering wheel and and control i'll just press you know the accelerator praise the lord amen but uh uh you know in in in the midst of all of this god has been so gracious to us you know he has been actually very gracious to the entire world that he has made he has never left the world without a witness amen that's part of everything that have happened throughout all the ages god has always have a witness you always have a people there is always a man that god you know has dealt with throughout the ages you know and and we are grateful to be on the ministry that that god raised up in this generation and and and uh has not only something that was done you know in one village somewhere or you know in some hating place but this was something that went around the world seven times praise the lord and uh we uh we are blessed to be on the under that that ministry and now so uh it has it has helped us because it is is uh it was it was a promise in god's word that in the days of the voice of the seven angel when he shall begin to sound that's in the book of revelation the mysteries of god will be revealed so this morning what i want to do as a set of year uh is to is to is to show just like how we read in isaiah 61 isaiah the prophet prophesied about some 6 700 years before jesus was born he prophesied that the spirit of the lord is upon me he spoke in the first person you know he prophesied the spirit of the lord god is upon me he have anointed me and and he said all of these but then after 700 plus years here is jesus stepping into his ministry after coming down from the mountain being tempted by the devil the bible says he went right into the synagogues now you realize that the synagos and the temple is is used in the kind of uh interchanging way in the scripture sometimes you see the synagogue sometimes they see the temple but as i had a thought on my mind i decided to to go back and and check a little bit and see what was the difference between the synagogues and the temple the temple actually was the place of worship it was the place of sacrifice like we said on wednesday night it's a place of worship it's a place it's a sacred place now the the the synagogues will be pretty much like what we would call the fellowship hall it was a place of discussion where people you know they would sit down they would they would talk about scripture they would argue there was a place where they could also be taught you know they would sit down and the teachers of the lord will come and teach them you know so so just like that so you'll see it in the scripture but it's also you know it's also amazing that when you look also in the bible you will realize that the way jesus talked about the temple he talked about it with such a reverence and the way he talks about the synagogues praise the lord he related all the the you know the the the evil arts of the pharisees you know he says there will come a time where there was caution in the in the synagogues you know and different things he talks about the synagogues but then you remember in the scripture where us in john chapter 2 where he says destroy this temple amen he actually did not point it to himself but he was standing right in the in the temple in the synagogues and he just gave that expression destroy this temple and in three days i would raise it up and the bible says they never knew that he was talking about his body praise the lord because you see there is one there is there is a there is a continuity of god's word jesus said the scripture cannot be broken god has expressed from time that he do not dwarf in temple made with hands every temple that was built was just a shadow god is more interested in tabernacling in our body than dwelling in this place then dwelling in these four walls how can you cage the great internal spirit in the four wall he's more interested in tabernacling in our body praise the lord praise the lord than just being caged in the building he's more interested in you than the building praise the lord more interested in you than your suit or your nice dress he most interested in you as a person amen then then your looks praise the lord so you see there is a continuity in the scripture even when when david has pressed to to build a temple god said the same thing to him i've never dwelt in temple i've always gone from 10 to 10 from tabernacle to tabernacle praise the lord so jesus here uh uh coming into his ministry the scripture says he went right into the synagogues he took the book took the straw of the prophet as i open it up right to where we read sister one and he read a portion of the prophecy the acceptable year that spoke of his first coming he broke the prophecy into when he wrote it read about the acceptable year the bible says he closed the book and he said this day this scripture that has been read i mean i prophesied 700 years ago this day this scripture is fulfilled praise the lord now so what what i want to do the reason why i i read that is to is to also uh show how uh uh actually i kind of forgive myself for a title year jesus preached the seven seals in matthew 24. so uh i was talking with brother mark wilson a brother over there in wanona yesterday uh he's here i think he's following the service this morning we were talking a little bit in and then talking from one thing to another you know just just appreciating the things that god is doing in the life of his children i mean but mac has been uh has been living down there for i mean almost over over 15 years now he's been in winona he got a job he flew directly from south africa to wanona and uh i mean he's been there all of these years and and uh and and and keep and holding his faith in his heart amen you know uh fellowshipping with believers and all of that so we were just talking on some of those things and just to appreciate you know how god keeps his people amen how the word of god is what keeps us we are not the one keeping the word is the word that is keeping us praise the lord and while we were talking about that and then and some few things we were talking about and then we started talking about the word condition also you know with everything that was that is happening around the world you know when and uh yeah the the the the full shortages that that the uh wf old is alarming on because of what is going on you in ukraine and in all of that so while we were talking on that and and then uh you know a scripture thought struck my mind and i was sharing with uh uh brett mackin and i told him i said you know it's it's been like that all through scripture or true scripture you will realize that uh god uh have used it's all through the scripture the way the bible plays it is farming pestilence and swallow that is the three whip that god always use to whip the nations praise the lord that's god's three whip that he has he always use that amen exodus chapter 5 verse 3 and they said the god of heaven has met with us let us go we pray thee three days joining into the desert and sacrifice unto the lord our god leads he fought upon us with pestilence and we swallowed moses and aaron talking to to uh pharaoh and his councilman you realize when david number the people that that he should not have done first chronicle chapter 21 verse 12 either three years of farming or three months to be destroyed before thy fall while that the swall of thy enemy overtake thee or s three days of sward or of the lord even the pestilence in the land and and you see that uh solomon when he prayed in second chronicles chapter 20 verse 9 he says if when evil cometh upon us a sword judgment pestilence or farming we stand before this house and in that presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou shall hear and help praise the lord you go over to in the book of jeremiah and i mean it's just it's all over the scripture so god have always used these three things he's always used these three things as as his whip on the nations praise the lord there's there's that's pestilence which is sickness and we have just come out of a pestilence which which is a sign of judgment the whole coronavirus global it was a global whip that have crumbled the word economy now we're slowly going into into farming because uh uh i was just listening to to to news and uh uh the wh artist is alarming because all of the wheat grain that comes out of ukraine now they cannot farm because of everything that is happening there is creating food shortages in europe and some parts of africa praise the lord and and the next one is swall which is uh which is war now so uh you will you appreciate this as we as we go as we get into what we want to talk about here now so we were talking on that uh even though i had i had something on my mind so as soon as we got through talking i was right here in my office studying i just went back into i said well that's that's a beautiful thing we just talked about right now i said i said lord okay let me let me just look into that and and kind of for looking into that then i came up with with uh you know i came up with what what we want to talk about this morning now so especially with all of these things that is happening in and you know and and and the entire world is alarming could this be world war three you know what ukraine you know everybody is salami and and and as soon as those things start to alarm uh uh the christian world the first place that people fall on is matthew chapter 24. the bible says there will be wars and romance of wars you know when people quick to fall back on matthew chapter 24. so this morning i will i would i would want us to just to just uh uh you know just study together a little bit praise the lord amen and uh you know i will i will i would want to take the liberty you know and and try to establish the church a little bit in some of the uh present truth amen of what is happening around us and and just to bring it out of the light of god's word this morning because that that is that's the responsibility of the of the local pastor you know brother branham says here in uh in uh in the message adoption he says bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know a kind of walking out on a thin ice he said we call it that way but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be a good you know a good to kind of bring the church what is a complete understanding positionally of what we are in in christ jesus and sometimes i think their preaching is wonderful it's a wonderful thing but i believe you know calling the brother their brother biller that teaching goes beyond that especially to the church now preaching usually catch the sinner and but uh it brings him on a condemnation by the word but teaching place the man positioning what he is you see and that's the reason why is the pastor's responsibility you know that's that's his responsibility to to be able to positionally place the church establish the church you see that's the reason why the efficient church you know broadband called it the more mature church why because paul spent more time with that church than any of the other churches and so he were able to establish the people right from the mind of god right from ephesians chapter one talking about you know god right you know god have choosing us from the mind of god and bringing us right into our human family and bringing us into the church and placing us under the fightful ministry you know and i mean he he i mean the efficient church was just a solid church because he was always there to establish the people praise the lord so we want to do just a little bit of that this morning with everything that is happening so what i'm going to do i'm i'm going to take a great thought from uh the sixth year you know uh where the uh uh brett branham is placing uh this whole matthew chapter 24 because you see matthew chapter 24 on the on the prophecy it has it has a great element that relates with revelation chapter 6. praise the lord it has a great element that relates with revelation chapter 6. are we together amen and you see the uh uh uh just like we shared with you before uh uh god there with the prophet daniel revealing to him now you have to realize when god was dealing with dania they were in captivity in babylon praise the lord and babylon was a gentile nation so god will first deal with the king nebuchadnezzar in a dream that he that he don't understand but that dream will represent the gentile kingdom praise the lord amen it will represent the gentile kingdom how god will deal with the gentile kingdom from the babylonian kingdom which was the head of gold down to the roman kingdom where we are now living in amen they have just changed from from pagan room to papa rome praise the lord amen it has its embassy all around the world in the name of the roman catholic church now so he will show and and and then jesus would come and tell us when he used that phrase until the the times of the gentile be fulfilled so there is a there is a period of time a dispensation of time that has been cut off called the times of the gentiles praise the lord so god will show that to nebuchadnezzar in a dream but there will be a prophet down here on the land to interpret that dream praise the lord now in the midst of uh of of of the the understanding of that dream because god is showing to daniel that the the the the babylonian kingdom the kingdom of the midst and and pressure the greek kingdom you know uh uh uh you know showing him all all of this kingdom you know and uh but then dania also is trouble and he's asking the lord what will become of my people i'm seeing all of these things and it's concerning the gentiles so he's becoming trouble what will become of my people praise the lord so in the midst of that dealing daniel is praying you know that's that's when he put his heart to pray and and and and then the angel came and said from the time you started praying your answer was on the way but the prince of pesha you know stood against me and micah the angel have to come and help me now so yeah uh uh uh uh the lord now gave down there a breathing that in this time of the gentiles when this time is fulfilled there will be a period of time that is called the seventh week amen and in that 70 week that's when your messiah will come for the offering of sins praise the lord so he laid that out to down here praise the lord amen but then he told daniel he says seal the book see those things because those things are for the end are we together praise the lord so you see we we are not we are not living in a world that is just run by wall street wall street do not run the world praise the lord they only manage the fine eyes of the business people it does not run the word the creator of the universe runs his universe praise the lord and he has laid it out in times and seasons how these things will happen praise the lord that's why we believe that uh uh you know the uh nothing is going to happen to us until god's purpose in our life is fulfilled praise the lord amen do you remember in the scripture that it was a time of farming you know where god had to use raven to feel a prophet amen he had to use raving to feed a prophet he had to send that prophet over to meet a widow woman that would give him the last meal for she and her son to eat but then that would begin the revival in that home that the oil will not go dry the the the flower bed will not go empty until because god runs the universe amen one million people or more in the wilderness with moses there is no walmart there are no walgreens and babies are born babies are born the people the the the generation that entered the wilderness were the children that were born in the wilderness the the generation that entered the promised land were the children that were born in the wilderness babies are born there is no maternity center can you think about that no warmer for them to go shopping and the scripture says their clothes never were out to get old neither the shoes on their feet praise the lord so which means god can even sustain the natural the material things that belongs to his children praise the lord amen you think it's only because you you uh you change your oil after every three months or you go to the market you think that's what is keeping your car going every time you stand behind that staring and say lord i'm about to get on the road bless this vehicle and bless every mechanical part [Laughter] god is able to sustain even the material things that pertains to his children that the god we serve are we together now so we see here that uh uh uh we we we want to take we want to take this joining a little bit and uh and trust that the law will will come and bless us together amen praise the lord now so uh the bible speaks here uh uh let's let's go over to the book of uh uh matthew chapter 24. there are few things that that caught my attention this will take us down to talking on the seals in revelation chapter 6 where the bible speaks about the seals but i don't want to get so much there into the teaching of the seals because it would not be fair to just start something and don't continue about it but i want to just grab your attention to to some so some few things that are very important trusting that the holy spirit will use that and bless you amen something will be said that will draw you closer to the lord make you to rededicate your life and and and serve the lord amen now so one of the one of the striking things here uh as we as we begin is to look at this scripture matthew chapter 24 the bible says and jesus went out and departed from the temple he went out and he departed from the temple and his disciple came to him to show him the building of the temple praise the lord now you have to realize also that that temple was built by herod and and uh and and and herod was serving on the the roman government and if you look in the scripture also and you trace you know the the the the birth line of herald you will realize that he's uh he's he's from uh edomite the group that comes from there now you will see that uh even even our lord jesus christ one time when he talks about him he said he was a fox and sometimes it looks like you know uh uh but there's there's a whole thing there if i just going through all of that i would lost my time here so the disciples is showing jesus the temple now you have to keep in mind now we're going to talking about the temple and the synagogues uh the temple of god and the synagogues of satan yes so would like to close with that talk now so you see here they show jesus the temple and jesus said unto them see in that all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another thou shalt not be thrown down praise the lord let's go a little bit in the minds of these disciples seeing the ministry of jesus the the healing ministry and the things that he's doing they start to to nurse in their mind this is the messiah then and we saw that in acts chapter one how they express or look in the book of luke that they were thinking that this is the time they will be delivered from the roman you know uh uh government or the roman rule and now they are showing him the temple and now he's telling them that there will not be one stone that would be left upon another i believe it kind of apostle them in their mind why is he saying this you know why is he saying this and the scripture says and as they sat upon man olive the disciple came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the son of uh thy coming and of the end of the world so three questions they give to jesus praise the lord three questions so as jesus go about to talk about everything in in that chapter he's addressing these three questions praise the lord amen it's just sometimes uh uh you know we need uh an ego eye to be able to tell us which verse pertains to which question and that's why we want to do a little bit this morning because just like isaiah 61 jesus is saying this but we will realize that in revelation chapter 17 jesus noun is going to in his future ministry he is now going to be showing john by a prophet ministry the fulfillment of this of everything here in in uh uh matthew chapter 24. so jesus spoke he's sitting there with his disciple see see all of these things that be now one stone left upon another and then he starts to narrate to them and and and jesus answered and said take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am the christ and they shall deceive many and he goes on and he's saying this thing they are sitting there on man olive and they are listening to him praise the lord but as they are listening to him it is a closed book they are just hearing what he's saying but they are not understanding it they cannot put them in it's just like when isaiah said the spirit of the lord god is upon me he have anointed me it took jesus to come open the very same scripture and said this day this scripture is fulfilled so when he says that what happens the bible says every i was fasting upon him because he spoke with such an authority and the world was so anointed that people said really now it builds expectation for people now to start seeing the blind eyes open for people now to start seeing that the captain being set free why because the world has not come alive when as i have said it anybody can read it i mean the prophets the the priests threw out the ages they read it and everybody could give their interpretation of what it mean but when jesus came he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in matthew chapter 24 he's he's talking in uh uh in the book of mark would tell us that it was peter james john and andrews those were the four that was with uh this is called the mind of all his discourse that's that's how the the theologians term it uh uh but there there there's the reason why we want to go down this road this morning is just to be able to to uh to help us to appreciate the ministry that has come to us in this age and to to show you that we're now following conan's divine feebles of men praise the lord amen just like the bible says in the beginning the spirit of god move upon the water amen one day in nazareth the spirit of god was in a body called jesus praise the lord if the spirit of god could move upon the water if that spirit is in a body it will walk upon the water [Music] because it's the same god praise the lord now when jesus was walking upon the water all he was trying to grab the the apostle attention is the same goal that moved in the beginning praise the lord this is the same god that is now in the amis if he can walk on the water what would be difficult for him to say peace be still and the wind and the way will obey him because he is the same god amen praise the lord so you see it it's just like when you read the word and you read god's promise that promise is not to stay in the book god is trying to show you that if i spoke it yet i can bring it to pass if you really watch out it's going to happen amen praise the lord so jesus here he's talking to the disciples praise the lord five of them he and four disciples sitting and he's telling them all of the sick he no man deceive you and and and and and here shall hear walls and rumors of walls you know and and that ye be not trouble for all of these things must come to pass but the end is not yet praise the lord a nation shall rise against nation kingdom against kingdom and uh but you see the the the the the question of the disciples was to jesus is tell us tell us when shall these things be amen when is it going to be where there will not be one stone left upon another praise the lord now but as us as as our lord knew also that these things were were laid out in in dispensation praise the lord amen so he goes on and he tells the disciples you know and nation shall rise against nation there will be there will be uh kingdom against kingdom and there shall be farming pestilence earthquake in davos places right here in verse seven again we see those three waves nation rise against nation the scripture put it right there because that's the way that god whips the nations and and and all these things are the beginning of sorrow then shall they deliver you now that verse 9 changed the cause of thoughts it changed the cost of thoughts let's go a little bit maybe the the technicians can be able to help us uh uh for some reason uh uh kind of left out some of my notes but what i have yet is enough to be able to set us in our path amen the sexual brethren says now let let's look to the book of uh the matthew 24 chapter the lamb himself speaking praise the lord in matthew chapter 24 it was jesus speaking in revelation chapter 6 it was the lamb who is the lamb of god jesus christ are we together the lamb himself speaking now anyone knows that christ is the authority of the whole book as far as that concern but this his speech here his semen to the people all right to the jews talking to those four jewish believers now i want you to hold the book of revelation uh matthew 24 in revelation chapter 6. and let's compare something just here a little bit and jesus went out and he departed from the temple just what we have just read and he came to him to show him the building of the temple and said unto him see yeah not all of these things verily i say unto you there shall not be one left be left ear one stoned upon another that shall not be thrown them now verse 3 as they sat among olive the disciples came to him privately saying tell us tell us when these things shall be what shall be the sign of that coming and of the end of the world now let's stop here these three verse three verses it took place actually on tuesday afternoon amen april the 4th 80 30. and the first two verse took place on the afternoon of april fourth eddie thirteen and the terror verse took place on tuesday evening of the same day so with this date we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled are we together now actually what is happening here is that uh he's giving the date of the the discus because we know that the temple was destroyed in 80 70. okay it's important to keep that in mind because you will realize that from this date to ad70 will be exactly 40 years the lord so from the time that jesus is saying this to the time where titus will income about israel i mean jerusalem will be 40 years and that that was also the exact amount of time it took them to go round about in the wilderness the reason why is important is because all of this happened around the same time when jesus looked at the fig tree and said no man we eat of thee he says no man eater of thee and peter and the rest did not honest to what he was saying but when he came back the tree was dry so in that very same time he was speaking life out of israel which means israel as a nation they will they will they will wander just like their father wandered in the wilderness they would wonder and wonder and wander and wander are we together praise the lord amen now let's let's go on a little bit there's there's a little bit of too much reading here so uh but i need to take my time so you you understand me now watch the first seal is revelation chapter 6 1. and that's what is in revelation chapter 6 1. you can write it down and you read it and i saw the lamb when he had opened one of the seals i heard as it was a noise of thunder and one of the four beasts said come and see and i saw in and behold a white house rather and he that sat on him had a ball and a crown was given unto him and he went for conquering and to conquer who did we find that fellow was it was the antichrist praise the lord but if you drop back to matthew chapter 24 jesus answered them when he started answering them he said unto them take heed that no man deceive you praise the lord he was talking to them when he uh when he started they asked him when would this be and all of that in verses the first thing he said to them take he no man deceive you what was the first event of the seal a deceiver going with a board and no arrow praise the lord amen now so jesus saying this year to them but also coming revealing that he served the prophet to it to john in the island of the pa of apartments are you seeing the parallel that was the first thing that he said to them now the thing did about uh that is that is surrounding this entire subject of the seals that makes it important for us is that we talked about as we were talking about the the white house rather the the rare horse rather the black horse rather the pill horse rather all of those things are the events all of those things are the events that happen when the seal is open but what is the seal who is the seal the seal is christ amen now take this thought as students of the world problem says when adam fell the title d went in the hands of the original owner praise the lord amen the title the the right to live forever praise the lord the right to never be sick again it went back in the hands of the original owner so in one sense the the deception in the garden of eden the the sin of our first parents is still christ that's the reason why two cherubim was put to the tree of life so in that sense it's a seal christ now was sealed man will never lay forever god said by the sweat of your brown you eat and unto the woman by conception in pains you will bring full life to the earth are we together so you see that's what make christ is the seal what we are seeing or we will see in the book of revelation of revelation chapter 6 the explanation those are the events those are the events so here he starts and say take heed no man deceive you and in revelation chapter 6 verse 1 when the first seal was opened who we see coming a deceiver praise the lord amen you know why this is important because according to revelation 10 this is our message without the opening of the seal we don't have a message we will be like ammon protestant church or any pentecostal church that was just prop will just be probing guessing at the word of god when the seals opened it brought us divine interpretation praise the lord amen that's the reason why we we can't just guess our scripture well i think it means no it must not be what you think because life is not in your thinking life is in god's word men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of god shall the man live amen are we together so you see how the comparison went so we see here when the first seal was open we see a deceiver an antichrist he had a ball he had a crown on his head but he never had no arrow he can never strike he's just on the house intimidating the people but he can't strike he's just a bluff [Laughter] praise the lord amen oh with your tiny muscle of faith you can kick him off of his hearse if you just stand on the name of jesus christ with your tiny little uh muscle of faith praise the lord i don't care what kind of a demon it is if you would just stand because with the word of god you have the arrow [Music] the word is the arrow that cannot miss is sharper than the two edges sword so jesus said be not deceived be not deceived don't be carried about with our appearance look for the word because the word has the arrow praise the lord oh my the word is becoming sweet praise the lord amen i'm not enjoying it because i'm preaching i'm enjoying it because it's enjoyable what i'm preaching or not i enjoy it glory be to god hallelujah now so we we go ahead if i would just keep this bible to the page where it's supposed to be and not keep closing and open it i will be faster praise the lord verse 5 jesus went on in matthew 24 he says for many shall come in my name saying i am the christ and shall deceive many now how many theologians have interpreted that that was christ because he was on a white house if you read many of the commentary on the book of revelation chapter 6 they said that was christ all because he's on a white house amen because of that glory be to god oh praise the lord how would you get it there's something that crossed my mind yeah okay let's go up let's go ahead i'll get to it but we know it was not christ we know it was the antichrist because jesus in matthew chapter 24 identified as a deceiving spirit and then in revelation chapter 6 it has a board it does not have an arrow verse 6 and years a year of wars in romans of wars see that year being that trouble for all these things must come to pass by the end it's not yet praise the lord verse 7 a nation shall rise against nation amen now uh let's let's i will let's let's take this other part of the note it brings out uh revelation chapter 3 6 3 on the on the second seal which of course is addressed that in verse six now the second seal matthew 24 revelation 6 three and four i i just i took these calls together and just work on it in a way that it would be easy for us to read and follow through now watch matthew 24 says now let let let me see what it says he says initial yellow walls and romance of wall and be in that trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet all right let's see what uh uh let's take the second seal revelation 6 3 watch he says now and when he have opened when he have opened the second seal praise the lord he says i heard the second beast said come and see and there went for another hearse that was red and power was given unto him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and here in matthew chapter 4 jesus says walls and romans of wars and there the second horse rather is taking peace from the earth he's beginning to trouble all the governments beginning to trouble all the political leaders and causing unrest all over and that they should kill one another and there was giving unto him a great soul so you see the soul comes there in chapter in in verse 3 and then if you go down again to the next you will see the pestilence in the farming so it's it's all there the walls and rumors of walls and and the nation shall rise against nation kingdom against kingdom and there shall be farming and pestilence and earthquake in davos places all of these are the beginning of sorrows praise the lord now let's let's notice here the tears heal that is farming matthew chapter 24 7-8 the nation shall rise against nation the kingdom against kingdom and there shall be farming pestilence earthquake in devil's places all these things are the beginning of sorrows praise the lord see you are coming right up now and enlisting and now revelation in the sixth chapter now we are going to open the tears healed and is found in revelation six five and six and when he have opened the tail seal i beheld the tail beast said come and seed and i be hell and a blockhurst and he that sat on him had a pair of balance in his hands and i heard a voice in the midst of the full beast saying a measure for a penny a measure of wheat for a penny and a measure of bali for a penny and see that thou heard nat the ord and the wine so in the in in uh uh honor this honor the seal the the tear seal we see that uh uh it's a seal that that uh described you know a time of farming which of course jesus speaks about that also so in uh in in just a cup just a cap as you go through you realize that the the the first seal the the action in the first seal now you have to know that the seal itself is christ amen the happening the events in the seals is all of these horse rather and what are they doing the action of those horse rather in the seal is to prevent the people from getting to christ amen why are the deception for is to deceive the people keep them in the church and they are not getting to christ praise the lord what is the blood shear for amen amen so i was looking at i was looking at one of the the the the ukraine video and and this old mama and i mean she was crying and and she said it just broke my heart she said i've been praying to god she says what have i done what what have we done that god is not hearing our prayer so you see when when when those kind of things are happening when they are happening one it weakens your faith if you don't have a stable faith in god and you start to go through trials it looks like everything it looks like you know maybe god is not real why is this happening praise the lord why is this happening where is god and ukraine is all burning up glory be to god amen but you see men don't look for god when they are indulging in sin praise the lord they claim that is their will they claim that is their enjoyment it's my life i can do whatever i want to do with it they don't they don't ask for god when they are indulging in sin but when josh men's tracks and and and and sickness right then they say where is god oh god where are you he always been dead but you see god works with his law they are unwritten law that god placed in the universe whatever you saw that's what you would read it's a written law there's a lot of contracts you will not appreciate the light and the peace that you have until trouble comes around so the lord of contracts just a law that god put in the universe that's why i govern the universe when people start going through trouble then they appreciate oh my god they appreciate the good days it's a lot of contracts he allows us to experience sickness in our body for us to appreciate good health praise the lord are we together now so you see the uh uh the major event in the first seal was deception the major event in the first year i mean there there are things i can pick up here i mean uh we we can we can just spend the whole day i just you know just that's the reason why i signed that's on all laws and the power just now because i i've just prayed and i said lord send the power just quicken these people left forget about time send the power fill our stomach that will not be hungry oh praise the lord now then and and then the major event on the second seal was bloodshare now if you even look at it in sense of the church ages amen after nissan council when pagan rome began papa rome they decided to merge with the church they did not merge with the church because they believe in jesus no they merged with the church because that was their way to creep in and weaken the faith of the believers praise the lord constantine wanted a victory praise the lord he wanted a record of ruling and not having a divided kingdom because the believers in rome they were not associating with the roman law so the way that he would get these people is to identify with them so if he can if he can claim that he's a christian he's a believer he can accept that jesus pretty soon they believe now that they have a a christian president on the white throne oh a christian president in the white house let me say it that way you won't find one [Applause] you won't find one praise the lord and that's the reason why we have to pray for our nations and the authority because the one that's supposed to be ruling controlling the time is the believer not from the white house our prayers and our stand for the word controls the ties praise the lord so you see the whole thing there was the beginning of deception they deceived the christians they came in observed their laws they loved to say brother branham say okay i can say brother branham say praise the lord as long as they got in and and you know the prophet said when you pay your tax and your offering you are a member i will pay my time i will make it double so when i'm ready to vote my vote will have a stain i would double my my time so i can control that's that's how they started influencing the ministry to lay by you know we are there a lot of dignitaries coming to church now all of these things are people shouting clapping their hands then let's you know let's get some nice group put them in a red quiet gown they can sink [Applause] but that was deception that deception will give birth to the nicolaitan spirit praise the lord amen but you think about it there is jesus telling his disciple they're just talking to them take he let no man deceive you and see the content of those few words he said praise the lord now as he's talking to the disciples all in your mind they're just thinking about the pharisees no we're not going to listen to this guy they can't they can dis we believe your ministry but he's looking into the future age he's looking where deception will get on on the warehouse and and ride around the world and then after after that spirit of deception grew to a place of influence now they started slaughtering people to take the bibles from their hands we only have to listen to what the pope says then now it started becoming the second seal a rare horse rather started going praise the lord there is not a period of time on the surface of the earth that this book did not address praise the lord amen there is not a period of time on the surface of the earth the events that took place the year and the day that you were born is recorded by this book are we together so uh what what am i saying i'm getting out of time this morning uh brother brown preached the seven seals an entire week i can take one day to preach everything to you so uh but what i wanted to grab your mind too is for us to be able to appreciate for us to appreciate the ministry that has come to us in this last day praise the lord just like we said yesterday i mean last week we were talking about the blood that speak at better things and we started talking about the dna and how god plays in our dna error correcting system and if the almighty god where where did he took it from it has to come from him if god can place in our dna an error correcting system how much more the blood of jesus christ has the power amen it has the power to correct everything that is warring against us the word has the power to correct if we can just trust the word of god bring our habits and our desires to the word of god it has the power to correct and line us up praise the lord all the people can see and they can post everything they think they know that is wrong with the message but there is a correcting because it's the word that corrects the error there is a correcting power behind this word that will produce god a bride without spot or wrinkle praise the lord paul said he will present himself a bride with a spot or wrinkle unless god produced that there is no way we in ourself we can come out that way praise the lord so we see deception moving in the first seal the second is bloodshed the third is farming amen the world was taken away from the people spiritual farming the fourth seal is death the fifth seal is is is the source under the altar is uh the the jewish seal praise the lord the sixth seal is the tribulation seal and the seventh seal is the coming of the lord is the rapture seal the resurrection seal and all of them write it in the in the book in the book of matthew chapter 24. let me let me just take another one quickly and and then we we find a place here to close then i will slowly bring you back to uh my my subject this morning praise the lord now so you see that all of these things all of these things uh they are so they are so beautiful jesus when he went about year in in matthew he gets to verse 8 and he says and these things are the beginning of sorrow then he says then which means after all of these things have started happening something is going to happen then shall they deliver you to be afflicted and killed under the seal six million jews were killed honor this seal the the the the devil that was riding this you possess atlas hit off for no reason he hated the jews praise the lord so when jesus was saying this he was speaking about a spirit that would come upon hitler are we together he says after you have experienced all of this now so there is there is a change there that that's what i want to show you there is a change in the way that jesus is going to drive this home he says then they shall deceive you i mean deliver you to be afflicted and kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake all nations at that time in that environment hather the jews praise the lord but if you read if you read the same account over in the book of luke let's get there while we why we our time is we are lost in our time in luke chapter 21 let's let's try and get there if you read the same account in the book of luke praise the lord the luke account started with jesus talking about a widow putting her widow might into the offering where he says that she has done more than all of the men that were in the offering i mean there and uh in the synagogues praise the lord and then there from verse five the scripture says in some of the and and some speak of the temple how it was a door with uh goodly stones and gift and jesus started the same statement as for these things we should behold a day cometh where one stone would not be left upon another that shall not be thrown down and they ask him and say master but when shall these things be now another thing that is it will be important for us to appreciate is that all of these men that wrote their account of the scripture we have to realize that god had the gentile people in mind that even though luke was not one of the the the the 12 disciples but he wrote this record he wrote this report and uh and being a gentile his interest in what was what was told i see that he communicated to two fellows of what he have heard from the disciples is in a sense of relating because we we know that honor the old covenant the gentiles could never come close to the tabernacle or come close to the temple they could never come close to the temple but yeri said that the gentiles now are are now being exposed to to what is happening and and they are coming to understanding that god had them in in his mind so as luke writes his own report luke is always associating it he's he's keeping in mind what god was what jesus what god was doing to bring the gentile in praise the lord so you will see that uh uh luke luke is one of the one that expressed until the times of the gentile be fulfilled you know when i see as he makes his his record here but there is something i want to grab to your attention to as as you as we read this take here no man deceive you that verse a for many shall come in my name is saying i'm the christ and the time draw near go ye there and uh go in that therefore after them but when is a year of wars and commotions being now terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and by then say he unto them nations shall rise against nation you know great earthquake endeavor places farming pestilence fearful sights and great signs shall be there in the heaven but before all these that's a different language when matthew give his account he says and then when all of these things happen after he talks about the first seal the second seal the test seal the falsie wall farming he says and then they shall deliver you so much you go directly into what will be happening to the jews praise the lord but watch luke on a report look as he list these things he says but before all of this before we even get to this place praise the lord you know it's just like brother branham says in in the greater battle ever fought he says there are men that are built to read the heaven heaven the bodies he said you can go outside at night and look at the stars and say oh my goodness pretty ah one two three four five six seven 8 and you try to count and then you know and you and you look at them but you'll realize also if you have a something like a telescope and and you look through that you realize the the the the optics of the telescope is made to be able to to bring that heavenly body much closer to you and then you will realize also that what you are looking at is more than what you are seeing praise the lord and there is another guy that is built to steady the heavenly bodies his telescope is not yours praise the lord because you are not somebody that started the heavenly bodies 500 is too expensive to pay on telescope praise the lord for me i will go to the tray store i want the 50 one i can't spend hundred dollars on that thing why because i'm only looking for amusement. praise the lord oh my oh my oh my but the man that is going to spend 500. one thousand five hundred dollars he said what that's why you spend on that there is a connection that makes him to spend that money he he artix has what they call resolving power when he looks to the heavens he's able to turn that thing and turn it and narrow it down his brain is not spread about he's seen a certain star in the heaven and he wants to narrow down and see what is that style because it's communicating to him for you is wow oh wow for him there's another language he's hearing praise the lord he can spend a thousand five hundred dollars well i mean how much it costs he's able to spend the money because he has an interest he's he's uh he's connected to the heavenly bodies he wants to get to them as close he wants to know them by name praise the lord you know it's just it's just like all the people that goes to the game some people just go to enjoy the game some people they want to they want to get close to their their best player and they want him to sign an autograph they keep sticking and pushing himself true praise the lord that guy has a language with the heavenly body he wants an identification so whatever it costs him he's willing to pay the price oh my goodness that's how it was for the christian in the dark ages that's how it is even for us in this age we are attached to this world and whatever it costs we are ready to pay the price praise the lord because for us it's not just church amen for us it's not what denomination you belong to praise the lord for us there is a rapture to go talk there is a millennia to come there is a new jerusalem praise the lord hallelujah and with all of those things in sight there is nothing in this world to be able to give up those things for we are ready to pay the price call us whatever name you want to call us we are ready to pay the price maybe your mind is just on a few meaning pleasure and why you can get out of this world but whatever it is it is perishable why are a form of enjoyment you think you can get from this present time is perishable so brother brahm talks about the those guys he says he says he says he says he says i'm not a sky i'm not a star uh gazer he said but there are men that are built for it he said just like those three wise men they were not brothers they were not triplets they were not neighbors either praise the lord there were three three young men from different parts that had the interest on the heaven the body and and from the different parts of wherever they came from they were all attracted to the same style when one looked at the star as he turned he turned he turned he's he looked at the star and what was speaking to him that is the star of a king praise the lord hallelujah as the other one steady the start he gave he see the start at the start of a seven he said that is the star of a seven it's a peculiar star it has a nature of a seven like no man like no other seven stars in the heaven praise the lord hallelujah and they stirred god as he was telling the style of strange my goodness man strange time amen i can see my understand the projector light is shining in my eyes first it's a strange strange stuff man as as he narrowed down and narrowed down all he could draw from that star or it was communicating to him was sacrifice all he was seeing is sacrifice man no he says no no no no no no let me let me no i think i yeah i think that i think the length of this thing is having problem because i have been studying i have been studying i see the constellation but as they are coming together what i'm drawing from it is sacrifice death like a death have never happened on the earth before a death of an innocent one and it's a better death all the messages were just mixed up i see zero in the lord oh my god the bible says the eyes of the lord run for and forth through the earth and that's the same where god built his prophets and he built his seven the house they are the ability to zero in on the word and tell you definite time and date of the fulfillment of the word praise the lord hallelujah so we close up now as we come back to the temple of the living god that god dwelled in a man that has raising up a synagogue of satan praise the lord paul says knowing that ye are a temple of the living god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you that's the purpose of the cross praise the lord i believe that many of us that are sitting right in this building this morning if we were in nazareth and ever had in our mind that that young woman mary was caring our lord jesus we will have love to give our bedroom we will have love to give our bedroom we will even buy a new bed set praise the lord but if he can have your heart he surely can have your bedroom if you can give him your heart he can have the best part of your life praise the lord can you imagine how the neighbor fell even the man that offered his bond can you imagine how he fell when the shepherds came and starts to testify that we saw angers that told us the messiah was born can you imagine how he fed the angel will announce this child but i wish i knew i wish the angel would have told me instead of giving them the stable i would have given them my bedroom praise the lord but that same almighty god is hovering in this building tonight looking for a heart that he can do it in looking for a young heart looking for the teenage heart looking for the heart that he can do her in a body that he can use as a temple praise the lord it's the one in the building this morning that is that is willing to give him all all your life is so precious to you and what you want to do with your life you have already plenty out that you don't think you have a place for this jesus and this religion in your life do you think you have just planned your life out i've already plenty out i know what i know what i'm going to do next week when this year end i raise some money i know what i want to do do you have your life planned out praise the lord but no matter what planes you have made it's just like going to sleep and eating a nice meal waking up and being so famished on your bed have you ever had those kind of for dreams when you went to sleep and you just had a nice meal oh my goodness the steak was so good and you woke up and realized it was just a dream you realize that it was just a dream then you close your eyes again trying to make it real that's what many of us try to do with our life whatever you thinking in your mind is just a dream you are trying to close your eyes to make it real you're trying to make it real you're trying to have an achievement let the musicians come we'll find a time to continue as the lord will thank you for being patient with me so [Music] [Music] our lord jesus said to his disciples [Music] just before he said those things he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also remain what a promise what a comfort he left with his people and showing us i'm going to prepare the place for you that where i am you'll be there also so you see the world can go in a way that is going all the cried of our hearts and the cries of the believers the crowd of the children of god like parents who cry oh god save my children children will cry oh god save my perish i have a friend i have a cursing because that's what the temple is for the temple is for sacrifice the temple is a place of worship it's not a place of discourse in the place of argument when the church has just become a place where a motivational speaker comes and just round the people up it has just become like a casino you wish to be lucky that you will be blessed you can put in this little seed and and and see put in some seed and you will get money that's what the church has become that's just a synagogue of satan to rip the people off but god is looking for temples bodies i will be able to bring worship or gratefulness to him lord i thank you i got a prayer request here of a young sister thanking god of turning another year this coming thursday i'm blessed to be living another year in jesus what a treasure that's what a temple is for where we can show gratefulness [Music] live a life of sacrifice to be a service unto our god and onto humanity that's the temple of the living god [Music] jesus came in and just before he left he got down on his knees and and washed the dust out of the disciples feet he said you call me lord and master i've done this to you do the same one unto another why because he was the temple the temple is a place of service it's a place of worship it's a place of sacrifice and that's what he want to make our life to be not the synagogues of satan that is just thinking about violence praise the lord thinking about death never the time that the thoughts of suicide has ravaged the minds of young people the movie industry fills their mind with all the violence put it in the form of games and they are playing video games filling their minds with demons that will soon start to haunt them for them to take their own lives let's just bring worship to the lord now that's why we are here let's turn to our feet faces

the dead and age that we are living in [Music] and with everything that is happening around us [Music] god almighty god is possessing lives he's entering into the life of people [Music] a few days ago
