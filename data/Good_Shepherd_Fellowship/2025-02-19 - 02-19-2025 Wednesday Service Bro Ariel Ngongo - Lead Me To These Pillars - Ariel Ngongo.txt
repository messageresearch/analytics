and shake your brother's hand and say God bless you and I know it's a Wednesday night and many have come from work and uh through a bu a busy schedule but may God Rich you bless you all amen amen so uh as you are standing with me we'll open the Bibles amen the Lord has been so good to us I have a little thought here I would like to share with you um it has been pondering in my heart and and as I was praying and just asking the Lord Lord what what you want me want me to speak tonight and this subject came into my heart so let's open the Bible in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 18 verse 30 Ezekiel chapter 18 verse 30 is you okay if we can all read together is that okay yeah we can all read together if you are ready you can say Amen okay uh Ezekiel chapter 18 verse 30 so therefore I will judge you oh House of Israel everyone according to his way sayth the Lord God repent and turn yourself from all your transgression so iniquity shall not be your ruin cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die oh House of Israel for I I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth sayith the Lord God wherefore turn yourself and leave you you may be seated isn't not a wonderful statement there when God is saying I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth you know isn't that powerful you know amen amen so please preach with me tonight and I I will try my best not to make a lot of mov mement I just you know take my time so that uh we can be able to catch these things a little bit so if you are while you still stay as sitting we can open also in the Book of Judges in the Book of Judges chapter 16: 23 Judges chapter 16 then the lord of the Philistine gathered thems together gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dean the God and to Rejoice for their said said our God has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands and when the people saw him the praise the God for the say our God has delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when their heart were mared that they said call for Samson that he may make us Sport and the call for Samson out of the prison house and made him made them Sports and they set him between the pillars amen verse 26 now this is where I want to focus a little bit tonight it says and Samson said unto the lad that led him by the hand suffer me that I may feel the pillar where upon the house standeth that I may lean upon them now it's a request that uh that Samson is requesting to a little L because at this point if you know the story of of Samson really closely you notice that he did not have his eyes he couldn't see so the little L was to help me to help him to get closer to the 10 uh to the two pillars is that right now uh which verse of yes Verse 18 uh verse 27 right there now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistine were there and there were upon the roof about 3,000 men's and women and beheld one Samson made sport 28 and Samson called unto the Lord now he is at a very desperate position now he's calling on the Lord and he says oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once avenge of the Philistine for my two eyes amen amen and Samson took hold of the two pillar upon which the house stood and on which he was born up of the one with his right hand and of the other with the left hand and Samson said let me die with the Philistine is that not our desire tonight now and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lord and upon all the people that were therein so the death watch now the testimony at the end of his life right because that's what matters right amen what matters is basically the end of the life of a person rather than his beginning are you with me amen now look at what the Bible says it says so the death which he slew at his death right were more than which they which he slew in his life so in death produced more killing or fulfill more of his purpose than when he was yet alive amen are you with me yeah so tonight I have I have a title here it might look a little strange but it's at the same time a prayer it lead me to these pillars am that's my title Hallelujah lead me to these pillars so as a background I want to really take my time here and we if you were Bible if you study the Bible very closely during this time it was the time of judges and the children of Israel had done wrong before the Lord their sin against the Lord and the lord gave them in the hand of the Philistine for 40 years is that right and the prophet thought us that 40 years is a generation so after the 40 Years of a generation came a new generation that rose up right and after the 40 years God raised up Samson amen amen Samson in order to deliver the children of Israel from the hands of the Philistine who rule over Israel remember Israel is a nation of God how many of us know it amen Israel was not supposed to be ruled by a certain Nation or a king they were supposed to be ruled by God himself amen but in this condition the only time that God allow another Nation to rule Israel is when Israel disobey and done something wrong against God because God would not all allow his inheritance to be given to somebody else that's God's inheritance but the only thing that separated Samson from his maker Israel from from from his maker he was seen when the SE against God is that right that's right now if we look at a a little bit here uh if you read the the book of of Judges if you have your Bible you can just keep it handy so you would notice that right at the beginning of the life of of of of of Samson he was very blessed he was a young man very blessed as soon as you know he came into this Earth it was under what we call the Nazarite vow what is the Nazarite vow the Nazar vow is a is a consecrated a devoted one a separate one unto the Lord are you with me so he was put aside for service now you notice most of the picture that we have we have uh Samson with hair because that that was actually you know how they were recognized you know and no razor should be used in his head are you with me right and the prophet says something special that really inspired me here in God of this evil age it says a Nazarite is one that is consecrated for a purpose that's right amen so he is consecrated Samson was consecrated for a purpose amen now he was consecrated for a purpose to engage and to to a purpose that's what the prophet says Samson was consecrated to an age and to a to a purpose therefore he had his long hair amen so there was in during that time it was the time where Israel had SE the cry out to the Lord and they say Lord you know we we we you know we are being mistreated by the Philistine you know we can't do anything and all of it God looked at it after a while he looked at his children he says no these are my children you know that's why it doesn't matter how far you are if you are a son and a daughter of God he will come after you is that right it doesn't matter how far in sin you are but if you are a son and a daughter of God he will come find you where you are now it's it's very sad now with the story of Samson a littleit when he was young if this the sister B can give us the scripture Judes chapter 13 verse 25 now you would notice at a very young age the the Bible says the spirit of the Lord began to move him at time in the camp of then between Zora and ashalon in other words you know the spirit of the Lord begin to steer him is that right yeah so at a very very young age people could already noce something special about the young man and I think all the parents here can actually see that is that correct you can see a little boy or a little girl she may you look very very young but you see greatness right the child is disclosing a certain character that is different than others is that right it was the same thing with Sams but the good part of God the angel came down and told his mother that this child will be special is that right amen now many could already notice that there was something special about the kid he was peculiar it was different maybe he had the character of a leader are you with me right now perhaps the spiritual people of the day could could be able to identify the character of this child said no there is something about this child because it's not given to everybody to be able to to identify a gift yeah not everybody is able to identify a gift there's only a special class of people that could look and say no there's something different Oh Glory to God are you with me praise the Lord now as a young boy the scripture tell us that it could already you could already recognize right greatness or a purpose of God acting in his life now when when he was a young boy a young lion came toward him roaring the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and although having nothing in his hand he was able to to that that in the the the the lion in pieces like a young boat are you with me am are you here and I know we all tired is that is that right can you say Amen to the word amen now you could notice that there was something behind the life of this young man that was special that was making him peculiar than the rest of them amen now in the message perseverance butam says something a lot of people thought that Samson in the picture painted looked like had a shoulder size of a born dog it says a man that size there is there would there wouldn't be no mystery how a man like that could pick up a lion and tear it yeah is that right right so if you look at most of the paintings in the picture you see something with with all the muscles and stuff like that but says it wasn't so amen it was a little look what the prophet says but it was a little curly headed shrimp little bit old seven LS little locks hanging down on his back like Mama boy he says little he was a little boy you see so what makes him special he was not how big he was but how small so God does not look at how big you are God considered the things that are the most neglected amen amen many of us may not be qualified but we are chosen a hallelujah amen that's right you see sometime you know it's not how well dressed we are it's not how well we can speak in front of people no it's not there it's what God places in the heart of a man that's right that's what matters the most are you with me so don't look at the size of a church don't look how dressed the people can be that doesn't matter you can find a very poor lady somewhere in you know in a corner of a street but she got more God in her heart than any man out there even more than preaching the so it doesn't matter Oh Glory to God now Samson was a little tiny boy and the prophet would say he was a it was a right it's a little it says to see a guy like that to slay a lion no wonder the Philistine wonder where is the hidden power coming from that's right so he awakened the Curiosity of people said no how can somebody small like this can f fulfill such things amen that's right oh my amen is it not the same as you know you in your room you're studying something and the Holy Spirit comes in the room you feel so excited don't you feel that way right and you start looking around you say oh I'm alone in the room do I have somebody next to me how many of us has feel that Hallelujah you know I remember at a very young age you you would pray and and and you feel the presence you stop you stop praying right away you stop praying because you're afraid you're like oh wow maybe a spirit will fall into this but with age and experience as soon as you feel that presence you jump yourself into that presence again more because you start seeking for more right Hallelujah that's right these things are reality it's not just story God is here you can feel his presence in the building Oh Glory to God oh my you know as long as Samson was keeping his Covenant because you know he was forbidden to cut his hair and all of it it was like a mystery it was something that was hidden it was not to be disclosed in front of everybody is that correct now as long as Samson could hide the mystery of his life nothing could happen to him as long as he was keeping the Commandment of God it could only succeed after succeed and succeed because at that moment the secret of his strength was a hidden power amen that's right and I do believe every one of us we we shouldn't disclose everything oh yes we need to have a certain discretion when it comes to special things that the Lord has given us because it's special it comes with a responsibility it's not to be disclosed to everybody and you know those things are secret amen only when the Lord tell you to speak about it then you can speak about it but if he has not said something I'll stay quiet that's the same thing with Samson amen Oh Glory to God am now as long as he had to keep those things the devil did not even know what to do with him yeah even the Philistine his enemy didn't know what to do with him now it's the same thing in the Garden of Eden God gave Adam and Eve the word and that word was there to protect them that's right to keep them even the virtues that was given to a woman has to be exposed to the word because you can't keep it by yourself that's right you can't keep those virtue by yourself he has the word has to do the work amen so as long as a woman could identify her virtue she she doesn't even have to disclose it you see Satan the serpent in the Garden of Eden knew the principles of Life yeah that's right you see what I'm saying so God gave them the word he told Adam and Eve the day that you will eat of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil you you shall die he already told him but when Satan came or the serpent came because the serpent is sat incarnate in the body because Satan cannot dwell because Satan is a spirit he has to use a body to fulfill his purpose amen so Sint that's why when you look around you know we are all here not everybody here a Christian amen this is true because Satan need to use a body to fulfill his purpose and as the Church of the Living God we might we must be able to know that oh my but as long as as Adam and Eve could keep the word of God they were protected but the mistake that they made they start reasoning to the devil lie every time the devil open his mouth is to lie amen that's right you want to know how the Devil Comes you know the word first if you know the word if it tells you something contrary to the word it's Satan amen that's right because if you don't know the word you will not know when it's coming and telling you lie that's right that's right you see what I'm saying it's the same thing with a a true dollar and a false dollar if you have not seen a true dollar you would not identify the false one that's right are you with me so if you have seen the true dollar you can be able to identify the false one but if you never seen it you can't identify it so when you get the word when the Devil Comes you can able to identify because the word spoke about how it's going to come but that's where men fell and a woman fell in the Garden of Eden the word was given to them to believe it not to question it amen the word says you should not do it don't even think about it don't even process it you just take the way it says you may not understand it but just take it the way it is and it will produce something Hallelujah but sadly you see Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden were given what we call the free more agency how many of us know what it is that's right in other words it's the ability to make your choice so in everything you can be a son or a daughter of God God is so gentle he's a gentleman enough to give you the ability to make your choice you must come to the place where you have to choose yourself is that right amen you know in the message the end time sign brother says is talking about the five senses it says your soul your body your spirit then the one channel Avenue one way into that it says your own freeo agency that is and you can receive or reject you do whatever you want because God is a gentleman he's not going to force you oh no no do this no no he will just advise you he says this is the way as long as you eating of this tree you will live eternally the day you will touch of this tree you will die and indeed the day that they touch it they die amen they did not actually you know they didn't bury them right away but it was a Propet a process of death that had already started in his body right amen that's right that's why when somebody dis believe the word it does not happen oh W I'm still good I'm still going to church no it will take a process that's why if you go back 10 years ago you were maybe on fire for God before you know it 10 years later you start becoming cold but the process had already started 10 years ago Church of the Living God this is what is happening and brother benam calls it the unwritten law Among Us it says choosing you must be able to choose and Israel was put in that position in the book of Deuteronomy 30 it says I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you I have set before you life and death amen it says blessing and cursing therefore he would advise you though it says therefore choose life amen that thou both both thou and thy seed may live that's right so he gives you the opportunity to choose but at the same time he gives you an advice he says choose life am amen amen are you with me right and brother says another message prison it says we all born a free moral agent Amen to make any decision we wish God justly does that because he must put every man on the same basic or he puts the wrong man he puts the first man on the wrong basis that he put on the free agency see you just exactly tonight like Adam and Eve so maybe of us many of us probably I've heard many sister will say man I blame Eve you you hear young sister will say that but the prophet is saying tonight we are sitting where Eve stood we have the same choice we have to make the same Choice as Eve did that's what brother bam says God does not judge a person because they are born in sin it says he he judges a man for rejecting the provided way to come out of sin amen you see sometime you say God look at the way I am and all of it God knows it not that he doesn't know what you're dealing with he knows how you feel better than the way you think oh my goodness are you with me so when when he came down as a man he had to feel what you are feeling right so when you telling him your nature he knows that your nature is th that's why you went to the cross and died that's right oh glory to God that was the provided way so that your nature can die so his nature can be transfering you oh glory to God I'm going ahead of myself amen now this is where Samson fail he was given the same free moral agency he was so confident in what God has given him that's right you know s this is the part where we have to be very very careful that's right there are gifted people in this world and we are all gifted in various way but the problem comes in our choices Oh Glory to God am but this is a part where Samson had a weakness somewhere how many of us know Samson weakness how many of us know that women for the sister will say oh no no no this is only for the brothers brother bham says something in many messages he says to watch those three things he speaks for the minister it says money women and popularity it's not just apply to ministers is for every single one of us Samson he fa because of a woman is that correct but Ahab fail actually for popularity BM he fail for money you see if you read the message you put those three brother talks about it so every single one of us once we make the wrong decision we will F to one of those things and brother bam calls it Satan three are Sal the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life that's right those three things are spoken in the book of First Peter this is where we have to watch for Oh Glory to God Amen he was powerful man but he sto flirting with a Heen woman he start going out he start feeling so confident it remember he he was a Son of God is that right he was a servant of God but he's choosing he's choosing he did not leave his full potential where God wanted him to be right God gave him the gift God was there and when he needed help of course the Covenant was on him you see what I'm saying the Covenant the Nazarite vow was on him so every time that the enemy comes you know he would just shake his hand oh just move a little bit and the spirit of the Lord fall upon him and he kills them it was there present but he never live to his full potential because of what a problem of women now it's not just Samson it's every single one of us maybe tonight is pride when we wrong this is where the problem is when we wrong how many of us will come and say please forgive me a long time ago that's what Christian used to do they would do wrong and say ah please forgive me yeah oh brother please forgive me sister I didn't mean it pray for me we stop pattering after the things of the world that's right you know we become what we eat without even knowing we copy one another you know brother bam talks about a pastor he said every time that a pastor start moving he preaching one hand everybody body in the church stop moving the same way because people are copying each other's Spirit instead of literally sing seeking for God's grace and mercy to receive the Holy Ghost we copying one is not the spirit this one is coming from this country and we copy each other Spirit instead of seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and now even in church people are joining clubs classes of people and everything look at what brother bam says where is as thou thy strength gone I I love the way brother bam brings it are you are you with me amen he says Samson got in the Bad Company it says you always paragraph 14 it says Samson got into a Bad Company you always you always can remember that when you are in a Bed Company you are out of the will of God right is that right amen you out of the will of God he says my own my old uh sudden mother used to tell me if you lay down with a dog that has fleas you will get up with the fleas you want me to repeat that again he said if you you sit closer to a dog that has fleas if you get up to go to go away the fleas will follow you too because that's the same thing with our company or the group that we hanging out with it says that that's rather a rude expression but it's got a lot of common every sense to it it says that's right you just can associate yourself with the things of the world and expect to stay spiritual and humble before the Lord Mercy oh my when I was reading the I said God help us that's why my prayer said Lord lead me to this pillar lead me to this pillar to do what to die MH because it's in a time where Samson realized I yes gone astray he cry out lead me to this pillar amen because this pillar that's where we are I need to die to myself that's right oh glory to God you love the Lord yes oh my goodness brother bam says another message it says oh let me continue continue the the the one it says you are known by your company watch what the prophet says are you with me he says you are known by your company there is a all saying show me your company I will tell you who you are yes so which means the people that we hanging out with has a certain effect of who we become are we together Amen in another message it says if God can only find one man that's all he needs one man that can fully surrender to him he don't take an army amen he never did use that he only uses men he says but you've got to surrender your soul your body your spirit your strength everything that you are to the will of God to become prisoner up to him you're going to be somebody's prisoner that's what says yes at the end of the day you will become somebody's prisoner watch what he saying now it says you don't belong to yourself you are somebody's prisoner you either a prisoner of the devil knowing this truth and once surrender to it or a prisoner to the world and surrender to God one or the other you either the devil prisoner to sin or you are God's prisoner to righteousness you one of the other or the other but I do believe that the story of Samson is having something in our life is that correct right he's awakening us a little bit this is not a sermon to say oh man this brother came and really blessed no it's a place where every single one of us come to a place where say oh wow God let me look in my own life as I'm preaching here s I'm not looking at anybody I'm looking at myself that's right sometime God gives us talent in all of these things you know Samson gave his strength to God but he gives his heart to Delila but God wants your heart and your strength yes you can't say oh God I'm I'm coming to church there's nothing wrong the pastor will see you in church but God is seeking your heart you say oh I pay my ti wait yes of course that's not a problem that's what God requires amen I mean God is Rich right yeah he is rich he has see all this gold that you see around here is the one who placed it right so he does not need necessarily your money but he wants your heart amen amen you see he he has that but what is needing is an exchange of character amen right amen that's what we spoke about the God of God which is the character of God it's an exchange you give me your heart I will give you my spirit am amen amen it's an exchange are you with me praise now if they can project for us I'll go really quick here thank you Jesus Judges chapter 16: 7 now we'll read verse 7 verse 11 13 and 16 so we can just if the sister can help me to project this really quick I will show you something for a minute here Judges chapter 167 if we can go faster please Samson said unto her now this is when Delilah would want to know the secret of Samson is that correct you know she does not you know the devil is so patience is that right he does not just come right away and tell you this is what I want no no no watch this the first time the first disclosure to theila was very very close it was getting very close to the secret of his hair of his Covenant watch this very carefully verse seven and S said unto him if they bind me with seven green with right and were never dry then shall I be weak as be as another man is that right verse 11 and he said unto her if you B this is when the you don't love me why you not telling me you know how many of us have read the story little by little watch this 11 and he said unto her if they bind me with fast with new rope they never uh uh that never were occupied then shall I be weak and be as another man is that right right now verse 13 and the L said unto Simpson here to thou has mocked me and told me lies tell me where wherewith that me be bound and he said unto her now watch how close we getting can you see that can you see what I'm saying yeah now he start disclosing little by little the mystery of his life it says now if that WTH the Seven Locks of my head with this with the web right now watch verse 16 now it came to pass when she press him da in other word she was pressuring her little by little now it became something that stopped battering Samson is that right you you notice it later on and it came to pass when she pressed him da with her word and urging him so that his soul will Vex unto death do you understand what I'm saying pressure pressure until you will disclose what is the mystery of your life cuz that's the way some Satan does it watch now verse 17 that he told her all his heart and said unto her there has not come that's the the fourth time I wanted to get into the church ages a little bit and brother talks about Luther Wesley right and the Pentecostal it says and the opening of the way I wanted to get into it because of time I I would not have time to go there maybe another day if the Lord help us and he told her all his heart and said unto her there has not come a razor upon my head and I have been in Nazar right unto the Lord from my mother's wom if I be Saven then my strength will go from from me and I will become weak and be like any other man and when Thea saw that he had told her all his heart he sent and called for the lord of the Philistines saying come up these ones for he has sold unto me all his heart then the Lord of philistine Came Upon uh up unto her and brought money in her hand now at this point Samson has already disclosed the mystery of his life you know what happened after that how many of us know that he lost he became weak the Bible says he thought maybe in the morning you wake up like the rest of the day but that day was over since none of us want to get to a place where you thought you will wake up tomorrow but you don't make it because God never bring somebody to judgment without warning him first amen the mercy of God is the warning right that's right because can you imagine a man like Noah preaching for 120 years the same message how many messages we have 1,200 approximately 60 but Noah preached one message it will rain for 120 years but God was so merciful amen God was so gracious on only eight people people made it Hallelujah you see what God's grace is amen God's grace is when you hear the message when you hear a good news when you were in sin they tell you now there is a way out of sin and you take that's Grace Grace is now when you are closer to cross the then you call that Grace no no no no no because he already warn you amen you see judge the Judgment of God it would be so simple where it's just full of regret because he had tried many times you will not even blame him that day you say no God I don't think that you just you know you no he would not say anything his silence your own conscience will play out [Music] amen that's right your own conscious you say oh W I came to church every day but when I was in church mind was somewhere else it will remind you that your conscience will remember that actually for the matter of fact your conscience will play the sermon Hallelujah this very sermon will play that dayen true that's why a minister of God when you stand at the pulpit you must be able to stand as a God's agent amen and not compromise am because people need to hear the word amen say how would they know the truth if there's not a preacher there must be a preacher appointed at that time to preach the gospel there must be a pastor in the Pulpit to actually preach the gospel for people to be saved there must be a brother and a sister on the street to preach but who's going to tell them who's going to tell them that Jesus healed who going to tell them that the Jesus Christ is resurrected you are the one to tell them Oh Glory to God I feel good now Samson eyes will pull out or gge out that's a very strong word I saw that s Samson could not see anywhere where he was going can you can you imagine it's not like the church people become so formal and and cold because their eyes has been taken out they can't see the promise of God anymore that's right they read the Bible like a book they can oh I don't see what what you know the Bible has to be when you don't understand it go on your knees and say God what does this me praise the Lord because the revelation of the word comes with a consecrated life and prayer amen amen in order to understand the scripture you must be into that atmosphere to understand what he says but if your mind is outwhere that that mystery cannot open it's still sealed because your mind is not ready to receive that that Revelation so when you comeing to God with prayer before even you open it you said God may you speak to me amen amen now when it opens your heart will be ready to believe because you are in the right place to receive the word hallu the grand is ready for the seed to drop in not in the Rock not in thorn but in the in the fertile ground that is ready to receive the word you know Mary she was ready she was thinking of that promise when the word came it was not hard for her amen her mind was filled of that promise when the word came to her she already believe it because her mind was ready her womb was ready to receive the child amen men ability you know sometime you know in the story of Samson God had to bring him to that place to realize how the human ability is nothing you must come to a place where you don't have confidence in yourself for God to help you you must get to a place where say God I'm just a mess if you don't help me I'm dead amen that's right amen this is the place where we must come to for every Revival to happen we must come and say God if you don't help me today I'm gone I'm dead right that's right God will prove it to you that your human ability will always fail amen amen amen Sint if there's somebody that feels like the pride this is the time where we need to revise our own mind this is the time that we stay in the pulpit and cry out to God and say Lord please be merciful unto me Hallelujah we must be able to realize that our human ability is nothing people before us fail they had a lot of money they make billions of dollars trillions of dollars there are people that gain Lottery millions and the next day they die they did not bury them with the money that's why the Bible says seek first the kingdom of God because once you have the kingdom of God even if you die am is precious to you is the kingdom of God that money will perish but what I have in my heart will stay Eternal the money is not Eternal but my soul what is my in my soul is eternal Oh Glory to God praise the Lord amen amen amen now if there's anybody that feels like oh man God I'm I'm so low I I I don't even know what to do maybe you are in the position of Samson tonight he says there are things that I'm doing in my life is not right I don't have to name it you know it every single one of us knows what we are dealing with when nobody's around that's right when the pastor is not there when the husband is not there when the wife is not there when nobody's around we know what we are doing so it to God there's those I don't know but God knows is the chief inside of this room right he he has eyes everywhere amen amen may God have mercy even me I'm standing here there are things that I need God's grace I'm not ashamed to say it that's why I said Lord lead me to this Pillar To Die lead me to this pillar I must die there amen because the glory that comes after die is greater than my whole life Oh Glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's so wonderful is that is that thank you Jesus M glory to God but now verse 22 now how did the hair of of his head begin to grow because God is the god of Resurrection yes you know Samson got to a place he met business with God it was not just that that can you s can you just imagine let me say this today they tell you that tomorrow you're not going to make it you're going to die tomorrow maybe I don't think that we we will be silence like that if all of us know that we're going to die tomorrow many of us will probably be here in the Altar and confessing our sin but Saint none none of us knows what happen tomorrow it can be one of us here can be me I don't know may God help us amen amen may God help us the prodal son how many of us know the story Luke chapter 15 he went astray and he did whatever he did wrong then watch this Luke 15:3 and now many days after the young young the young man a son gathered all together took his his journey into a far country and they wasted they wasted his substance REI it so he was leaving a a a propagate life a reckless life he went and lived in a in in extravagant life so he he really wasted everything but at that moment the child realized he says no in my father's house I will not live this kind of life here hallelujah that brought repentance let me break in pieces here just for a minute verse 21 and the son said unto on his father when he came back he said father I have sinned against Heaven Oh Glory to God it says in the sight and I am no more worthy to be called the son can you just imagine the level of sincerity of that boy when he came back yes Jesus said do you know what repentance means how many of us may actually Define what repentance is you know what repentance is who can Define it for me to change one's mind that's the definition of repentance to change one's mind for better hardly to amend with an orance of one person Hing one person one's person to your old person to hate it in other words let me say this you going you're leaving the north going south they tell you they're going to the from the north to the South is wrong repentance means to leave the South to go back to the north because you've heard that this path is wrong it's to return once the truth has come out it gives you the ability to return back oh glory to God glory to God in the Book of Psalms he saying oh Lord now when somebody comes with a sincere heart watch what David says here he says oh Lord open down my li My Lips and my mouth shall show forth that praise amen for thou desirest not sacrifice you see what I'm saying because the Old Testament they were giving sacrifices the offering sacrifices rather right he says for thou desire not sacrifice ours will I give it thou delest not in burnt offering the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit and a contr heart oh God thou will not despise yes amen God let me say this God will never despise your broken heart when you wrong you get on your knees you say God I'm wrong help me I need Mercy you know me better than myself you know this sin you know what I'm doing wrong Lord help me why is it hard for us to tell him that openly when he knows it M he just want us to confess it that's right because at the end of the day God will meet us in a certain Corner amen Samson was powerful for a certain period of time but at this moment at the end of his life he reached the wall yes the good part for a Son of God he will repent even in the last minutes of his life is willing to repent and say father I've sin but I'm coming home even if today is the last day of my life Lord I want to make it right amen but another person like Cain the very last day they would look and CH and turn back because the nature of that seed will show it and that's the part where we cannot temper with that the seed you cannot just change in the last minute because it must bring forth after its own kind that's right a son of God will go and they will never be lost because they have to make it right the others because the pastor been talking about the two seats everything had you know Jesus speaks about oh my goodness I think I'm just going to close because it's not even halfway whatever I was planning to go Jesus speaks about the Ser he came and he dropped a seat are you with me are you with me amen it give this Parable it says a so took a seed and Dro it right they Dro on the ground and after a while the uh the enemy came and dropped the tears too right right so both of them were in the same spot but now the servant came to the the the the master said Master you know did you noce the the master he looks like he knew it he says I know it's the enemy that put it he said can we remove it he said no no no no no yeah let it grow them let them grow together you say why did they just get rid of it no let them grow together it says at the Harvest everything has to come to maturity every Spirit must come to maturity that's right so you cannot say that you know in my you know the devil will not be you know I don't want you devil no you guys must grow together what is giving you is character because you need your enemy to build character is that right but on the other side with the weed right it shows the genuinity of who you are and I told you of the dollars the false and the true dollars if you know the truth you'll be able to identify the false one but it was at the end during the Harvest time that they had to separate it everything are showing the fruit at the AR may God help us may God help us may God help us prise Lord same thing with with Jacob he has been running away from his you know when he lie to his uh to his brother is that correct are you with me you love the word hallelujah he lie to his brother you know he took the the the birthright right and he also got the blessing from his father right yeah now if you watch Jacob after doing so Esau was following him is that right and he went to Laban right and he worked with Laban you know seven years for Leah seven years for Rachel and six years for the car right so if you look at that period of time before he get to Laban he met God right where he saw the angel ascending and descending yeah he went to because he was the god of is that right amen so from that time he went to Laban right and he spent 14 years plus six right almost 20 is that 20 years my mouth is still working so 20 years and after the 20 years God told him to return but Jacob had an issue now to return because his brother was waiting for him you see what I'm saying though God gave him all these Pro uh uh promises but Jacob was so afraid in his mind he says okay let me send candle ahead for my brother since I heard that he's coming to meet me you know he tried to offer his brother some the same way he did but at this point Isa was already reached he didn't need it but he was so desperate that Jacob said no I need to meet God Amen I need to meet business with God that's right amen you see what I'm saying he was at the desperate position and that moment where all hope was gone says where I'm whereever I'm going is going to kill me he says at this point I must mean business so as he was going he met a man he met the angel he wrestled with him in other words he overcame that angel that's what comes with the new birth brother bam says the new birth is the self-denial amen you know the free moreal agency that we started at the beginning is the the new birth is the death of the free moral agency in your life that's why Jesus he had a choice to make Oh Glory to God Jesus had the choice he had even the choice to get married he had the choice to have children because he was a man he had the choice to make right but he says he sanctify himself for us yeah amen he decided not to go that way not that because he was you know it was forbidden for him to do that but he made the choice you see why Jesus also has his pillar to be sent he had to go to his pillar which was Calvary he had to carry the Cross Too amen you see what I'm saying the Holy Spirit led him to Calvary because of his purpose the same way as Samson his purpose was to kill the philistine Jesus purpose was to go to Calvary and die for my sin so he had to go to Calvary too praise the Lord so if Jesus went to Calvary we must go to Calvary am amen praise amen you see what I'm saying we must go to Calvary amen amen Oh Glory to God you know in the Old Testament Jesus was the is the perfect L but number Hebrews chapter 10 it says the having a shadow of the good things to come right in the Old Testament they will take a lamb you know they'll bring it before the you know the closer to the bring bring altar you see he will put his hand on the on the on the sheep or whatever it is right and they'll cut his throat and the blood will gash out he could see the pain of the innocent animal are you with me yes he could see how the animal was suffering so the animal was substitu for him the animal was standing between him and a holy God but the animal does not have a soul so the life could not be transferred that's why the worshiper he will come and kill an animal at the altar he leaves that place say oh god I've done wrong and they killed the animal he goes back home with the same desire that he had and they would do that over and over and over he will lie and go go offer the sacrifice for the LI the next minute he comes back for another one but with Jesus Christ there's only once with a sincere heart a contr spirit to be willing to die EST said if I will die if I'll perish I'll perish yes the four the four Hebrew children he says if and if God does not I'm willing to die amen this is where the Christian how to get toen there are many things that in our life Pride there are many things last call it every single one of us knows things in our own life and now even technology has been one of the demon power from hell that's has been killing us all our family life is being destroyed because of that sometime we don't realize it but God want us to come to the altar am that's my prayer tonight Lord lead me lead me to Calvary lead me to this pillar let me die there and Paul tells us that we Must Die daily every day since I could have gone through so much but as I'm closing something that has to happen in our life every day every single one of us I know it's not easy it's hard but we have a promise but we cannot get to that promise if we not will live to die every day you know if is our proud Pride maybe the way we talk to one another our insult everything our thoughts our complexes all of these things that are happening around us God help us how many of us are willing to lift their heads up and say Lord I can't recognize something in my own life yes may the same God that inspir us to speak to you may the same God comes and touch you wherever you are Saints it does not have to be a call at the altar right there where you are you just need to say Lord lead me to this Spirit lead me to Calvary I want to die there so that I can kill more of my enemy and my death because remember without the new birth you cannot really destroy your enemy you must come to that spot there is a victory that is ahead when a man and woman are born again yes maybe the little Victory here and there you fall today you wake up but the new birth gives you power that the enemy will always be under your feet thank you Jesus oh my thank shall We Stand than you you know God can do Miracles here tonight how many of us are un expectation to re see there you know it can happen so quick before you know it a habit can just drop here how many of us are willing to drop something tonight how many of us are willing to drop our pride I don't know why am I going back to Pride I don't know why is there something in our life that we we don't forgive anybody you know we so hard to forgive even our enemies you know our wife our husband we so hard on them and and we say things that we are not to say you know can we just say God can you take away this anger you know can we say like Robinson you know who said you know if you don't fill me with the Holy Ghost they will find my bones there were men and women that were determined to die to themselves they met business they hated those sins can you hate that sin tonight and say Lord I need help may God bless you as for the one is coming Lord take my
