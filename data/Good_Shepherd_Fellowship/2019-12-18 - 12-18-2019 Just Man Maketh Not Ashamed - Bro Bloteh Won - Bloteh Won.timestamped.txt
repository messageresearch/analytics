[28:34] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank
[28:40] you Jesus amen amen amen
[28:46] praise the Lord

[29:12] [Music]

[29:37] ah
[29:39] hey Dad
[29:42] [Music]

[31:41] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:43] Christ praise the Lord it's good to be
[31:47] in the house of the Lord we just bring
[31:50] you praise report tonight amen
[31:59] thank you for the one for stepping in
[32:01] the 18 leaving us tonight amen
[32:06] you know for many years brother Branham
[32:11] says something in the message he
[32:14] preached where he talks about total
[32:17] delivering the message total deliverance
[32:19] in that messages he speaks about total
[32:25] obedience to every word God entitle us
[32:29] to the Holy Ghost and and for many years
[32:35] you know I don't know about other people
[32:38] but for many parties right you know he
[32:43] says total obedience to every word of
[32:46] God so in your as you read you you feel
[32:51] like every word every word of God means
[32:53] every word of God but you know it's just
[32:58] like the scripture you know when you
[33:00] read one verse and and you read the next
[33:04] verse it takes God to connect you to the
[33:07] next verse to see how the how the change
[33:12] in the scripture or what the Holy Spirit
[33:15] was doing in a particular time and
[33:17] Barbara Branham said there I never
[33:19] taught battle as I were protocol up for
[33:22] you tonight but when he said there the
[33:26] next paragraph he says repent and be
[33:33] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:36] Christ so when he talks about total
[33:41] obedience to every word of God he gives
[33:46] us an entrance to every word of God
[33:48] because that's where it begins from amen
[33:53] repent and be baptized in the name of
[33:56] the Lord Jesus so that's were there's
[34:00] there's that that's the doorway you know
[34:04] to obeying every word of God praise the
[34:09] law and and and sometimes that that is
[34:16] the way we've gone in in in human mind
[34:19] we always try to process things and in
[34:24] our our our our our China of processing
[34:29] things we over processing we over think
[34:33] about it until it makes us afraid and
[34:38] then we get nervous and then we get
[34:40] confused and then when we think about it
[34:42] so much then we even start doubting the
[34:45] very thing we were thinking about you
[34:47] know that's that's how the human mind
[34:49] works what you see
[34:54] it takes obedience to God's Word
[34:57] amen to give us the victory last
[35:02] Wednesday we had a prayer meeting and we
[35:05] were going to continue in a channel of
[35:07] their prayer meeting tonight so we will
[35:09] have a prayer meeting tonight
[35:12] and just like we did but let me let me
[35:14] let me testify to you tonight a little
[35:18] bit
[35:19] our sister billers who will be traveling
[35:22] this weekend and to Iowa to visit with
[35:26] her brother and then she would be bad
[35:29] she wanted me to let you know so you
[35:31] will continue to pray for her she's one
[35:33] of the oldest ever less sister they have
[35:37] been with us here for for some time

[35:50] the entire church for standing where he
[35:52] and his family amen
[35:53] we had a good visit with him last night

[36:36] the week and then she wanted to most of
[36:39] the time you know I'm mad and that's so
[36:42] much of a person that likes to
[36:45] there are things that I talk about there
[36:47] are things that I don't talk about let
[36:49] me say like that so well she met meaning
[36:52] but she said it's - meaning it was very
[36:54] very powerful so I want to share with
[36:57] you and she being brain you know she's
[37:01] just been praying and trusting the Lord
[37:04] and you know committing things to the
[37:06] Lord she's never come in a week weekly
[37:09] services from Wednesday night just
[37:12] because of the nature of what she does
[37:14] and so on Monday last week she had
[37:23] accounted for repetition of dreams that
[37:27] was happening all through the night and
[37:29] what actually was you know she started
[37:35] you know praying for the church and she
[37:38] saw us going into a prayer service you
[37:44] know and I mean we were having the
[37:45] prayer service like praying like never
[37:47] before
[37:48] you know the candle like the spirit of
[37:50] supplication just break upon the people
[37:52] you know then people were praying and
[37:54] there were different things you know and
[37:57] then the dream repeated again and then
[38:00] Wednesday night normally she would she
[38:03] would turn into the service but she did
[38:05] not turn into the service I don't tell
[38:08] she she watched the service on on
[38:11] Thursday and and it turned out to be
[38:14] that the very thing that she was
[38:18] dreaming about I mean there were some
[38:22] things that were very specific in the
[38:23] dream and those things were Pacific on
[38:26] Wednesday night praise the Lord
[38:29] and it might not mean nothing to you but
[38:34] for me being the preacher I know what it
[38:37] is he meant it means a whole lot praise
[38:39] of God and I just had had a burden on my
[38:44] heart you know you just have preeminence
[38:47] Wednesday night and and then gradually
[38:50] we go into the new year with their
[38:53] praise Lord so realizing that a Lord
[38:58] even started witnessing to her when I
[39:00] have not even said it and then I even
[39:02] announce it
[39:03] you know that was that was very
[39:06] comforting I was that was confirming
[39:10] praise the Lord
[39:11] and we want to thank the Lord for that
[39:14] praise the Lord
[39:15] and we will just we will just encourage
[39:18] you to to pray you know less let's open
[39:24] our heart to the burden of Prayer you
[39:27] know let's find time to pray
[39:30] morning afternoon you know whatever time
[39:34] we came in the middle of the night fun
[39:37] time to pray amen
[39:39] spend time with God if you if you just
[39:43] don't have nothing to pray about nobody
[39:45] just remember me amen
[39:47] pray for me praise the Lord so and we
[39:51] thank the Lord for all of those things I
[39:54] just believe that God in His mercy he's
[39:58] mindful of us amen
[40:00] he's very very mindful of us so tonight
[40:06] just before we go into our prayer
[40:11] meeting and I came ready tonight I was I

[40:21] birdie number one how to to lead us into
[40:24] worship we talked about it here myself
[40:27] in Owen and I appreciate you number one
[40:31] he told me he says he says you know I
[40:36] don't take it lightly going behind the
[40:39] pulpit I mean it's not a place to joke
[40:43] it's not a sure thing it's something
[40:47] that we all might take and was take
[40:50] seriously and we must respect everything
[40:55] that we do when we enter into there
[40:57] through those doors
[40:59] Solomon being a wise man he said in the
[41:04] book of Ecclesiastes chapter 5 he says
[41:06] wash your feet when you go into the
[41:09] house of the Lord wash your steps don't
[41:13] just come flapping your feet and
[41:15] throwing your hands and you know and
[41:18] then just come and sit down take your
[41:20] chewing gum and go out to the bathroom
[41:22] come in you slam the door in or death
[41:25] praise the Lord wash your feet
[41:28] go into the house of the Lord you just
[41:31] think about it those people the Old
[41:33] Testament Tabernacle even one man could
[41:37] go into the holiest place and when he go
[41:41] they had to tie a belt around his lash
[41:44] and he had to wash every step holy holy
[41:47] unto the Lord
[41:48] one mistake he made he fall dead and you
[41:51] have to drag him out praise the Lord and

[49:18] as we continue to talk on our subject of
[49:20] shame I want to speak on just man may
[49:24] not a shame I just read a portion of
[49:27] code there brother Branham said about
[49:32] Joseph just want to run through there
[49:36] quickly so I can introduce my tortilla
[49:38] so we can pray but branches now little
[49:41] virgin one day she probably had hard
[49:44] time beautiful little lady
[49:48] I mean praise the Lord
[49:54] she kept herself clean from from the
[49:57] world and she lived in a lot Munno town
[50:00] then Dowson creaky she lived in Nazareth
[50:06] but she purpose in her heart that she
[50:10] who served God and she was just an
[50:15] ordinary little woman she was going with
[50:21] a man that was a widow of four children
[50:26] and his name was Joseph
[50:30] we do all means that he was married
[50:32] before his wife died and you know then
[50:37] he thought that he should get another
[50:39] wife praise the Lord
[50:41] you know many times this scripture mark
[50:44] chapter 6 verse 3 let's look at it very
[50:47] quickly this scripture is is is it's
[50:51] really confused in in the Bible praise
[50:56] the Lord and because Mary Mary was a
[51:08] virgin Jesus was the first fruit of her
[51:12] womb the fruit of her warm so in in
[51:16] their sense many times this scripture is
[51:18] confused in a sense as it is written
[51:22] here mark chapter 6 verse 3 is not this
[51:26] the cap into the son of Mary the brother
[51:30] of James and Johnson of Judah and Simon
[51:33] and are not his sister's here with us
[51:38] and they were offended at him now many
[51:44] times people will think that these were
[51:46] married children these were called the
[51:50] brothers and sister of Joseph I mean of
[51:53] Jesus because they were Joseph's
[51:55] children praise the Lord Amen because
[52:03] they were Joseph's children and from his
[52:10] first marriage before he got exposed to
[52:16] Mary
[52:17] praise the Lord sober Benham says she
[52:23] was an ordinary little woman she was
[52:26] going with a man that was a we all of
[52:28] four children and his name was Joseph
[52:31] and they plan to get married in one day
[52:34] when she she had to she had the picture
[52:39] on her hair perhaps göran göran
[52:43] to the virgins well now last year we
[52:46] were talking about the woman are the
[52:48] well she never had to come at this time
[52:51] the mirror was coming because many years
[52:54] she was among her peers amen
[52:56] they call it the well of the Virgin in
[52:59] us and as she come down of the hill
[53:04] maybe say there was Monday morning she
[53:07] was going to get the daily supply of
[53:11] water and those women can pack a package
[53:15] jar of water on the head and in one on
[53:18] each hip and just walk as steady and she
[53:22] was going down to get water and she had
[53:25] a joke perhaps on her arm and she was
[53:29] going alone thinking about the scripture
[53:31] that had data perhaps I mean that she
[53:35] perhaps heard the robber or maybe she
[53:38] induces looking from the front the front
[53:41] porch across the hill where they were
[53:44] going to have be a home and he was a cap
[53:48] injure all those had to be faith faith
[53:52] perfect you know and and and a little
[53:55] hard hats on the world and because he
[54:00] was taking his sweetheart
[54:03] to this one this was a special house him
[54:07] and his sweetheart was going to live in
[54:10] a mean and they were reading the straw
[54:15] on the front porch Joseph read their the
[54:18] scripture the day before unto us a child
[54:22] is born unto us a son is given and the
[54:26] government shall be upon his shoulder in
[54:28] his name shall be called counselor
[54:30] Prince of Peace mighty God everlasting
[54:32] father and his kingdom there shall be no
[54:37] end and maybe Mary said yourself will
[54:41] you read that structure again dear and
[54:44] he read it again
[54:46] who was as I uh speaking of they're all
[54:49] no doubt the Messiah he will come
[54:54] someday
[54:55] praise the Lord and the next morning on
[54:59] the road and the common little GERD
[55:03] about 18 years old going alone to get
[55:08] water down at the well and on her Road
[55:11] that morning perhaps she's seen a life
[55:14] flash and she said it must have been the
[55:18] Sun maybe coming up in the early Julian
[55:23] morning and the dew falling and the dew
[55:28] holding the fragrance down to the ground
[55:31] how beautiful amen now I just wanted to
[55:35] read this just to be able to to capture
[55:39] our mind a little bit create a little
[55:41] picture on our mind as we look at this
[55:43] story together and but the Bible year
[55:48] you know speaks about on this wise Jesus
[55:55] was born praise the Lord
[55:58] meaning the things that were around his
[56:01] birth there were many things that were
[56:03] around his birth we saw what the
[56:05] prophets have spoken besides everything
[56:08] that was that was in the Old Testament
[56:09] scripture at a time that he was going to
[56:12] be born there were many things that were
[56:14] happening around his birth we have to
[56:16] realize that this is the greatest gift
[56:19] that God was going to give to the world
[56:21] and like the prophet of God said he says
[56:23] God always protect his gift amen
[56:28] when God is giving a gift he will always
[56:31] protect it praise the Lord why because
[56:35] there is an identification of God with
[56:38] his gift a gift identify the giver
[56:45] praise the Lord
[56:47] that's the reason why gifts
[56:50] I chose him you just don't jump out
[56:54] there in and just pick up rock and you
[56:57] know anything and and for the oven and
[57:00] go and give it to somebody that's a gift
[57:03] sometimes it's difficult to give people
[57:06] gifts
[57:07] because we have to be thinking you have
[57:09] to be thinking and trying to think about
[57:13] what is happening at that time you see
[57:15] their birthday they see the graduation
[57:17] you know and and how can your gift be
[57:21] able to address what is happening at
[57:24] that time and and now only about them
[57:27] but even about yourself how much will
[57:29] your gift speaks to them how much would
[57:31] they remember you know this it would not
[57:34] be something that we just open look at
[57:36] it and once and it gone away from their
[57:38] mind it man praise the Lord
[57:40] so like the prophet of God said he says
[57:42] God protects his gift and God about to
[57:45] gave the greatest gift to the world
[57:48] he era said that God in His sovereignty
[57:52] praise the Lord amen we spoke on this
[57:56] before but I want to go into into a
[58:00] channel year to to be able to see that
[58:05] realizing everything that was happening
[58:07] around there even though there was a
[58:09] prophecy in the scripture a virgin shall
[58:12] conceive but the people did not even
[58:14] know how it was going to happen and
[58:16] realizing that no matter if it's the
[58:20] Word of God that is said no matter if we
[58:22] were warned about it if those things
[58:24] happened before before our eyes we
[58:27] always as Hemus tried to reason it out
[58:30] amen
[58:30] we always tried to say well maybe it was
[58:33] not so maybe why it had to be so do you
[58:35] realize oh do you really think that that
[58:37] was a so God in His sovereignty he made
[58:41] a provision and what God would do God
[58:43] would take this man Joseph I Colin - to
[58:48] a history he was about about 40 years
[58:52] old like Burt Branham said he he had
[58:54] married in you know what he was he was
[58:56] living happily his wife went to be with
[58:59] the Lord
[58:59] and his children has grown up a little
[59:02] bit in and and and well you see that
[59:06] girl who keep him amen
[59:09] I go keep him after this he will not be
[59:13] a man I would just be I mean just
[59:15] running around with every woman there in
[59:18] Nazareth but he will be a man
[59:20] and I mean he's he's watching over his
[59:22] children he won his children to grow up
[59:24] in you know and uh to be successful
[59:29] I mean to grow up in the things of God
[59:31] he spent time to bring them up but yet
[59:34] there was a need in his life to have a
[59:36] wife praise the Lord
[59:39] amen and this young woman about 18 years
[59:45] all she's she's just had a place to get
[59:48] married
[59:49] praise the Lord amen
[59:53] thinking about her future thinking about
[59:56] her first child thinking about what or
[59:57] whom would be thinking about her wedding
[59:59] veiling and and all those I was saying
[1:00:03] as a bride mates in her wedding and
[1:00:05] thinking about the night world she would
[1:00:09] go and be will hop urgency and that's
[1:00:11] what I think that's what has come over
[1:00:14] to to to us like what do we have as how
[1:00:17] they call it her brother's something you
[1:00:21] know Showell
[1:00:22] in that that thing came down from the
[1:00:25] time were a jet tied our daughter was
[1:00:30] just I vowed that the first thing that
[1:00:32] would come from out of my house
[1:00:34] I was sacrificed to the lawn and and and
[1:00:36] when her dad told her that he had made a
[1:00:39] promise to talk to God and he was going
[1:00:42] to sacrifice her you see God kept a
[1:00:44] perfect type in the scripture just like
[1:00:47] how he allowed Abraham to give His only
[1:00:49] begotten Son that was the same way he
[1:00:52] laid out that gesture we gave his only
[1:00:54] begotten daughter why because God image
[1:00:58] is perfect male and female prays alone
[1:01:04] and then Christ sacrificed for us but he
[1:01:09] will also have a people that will be a
[1:01:11] bride I will also sacrifice him in that
[1:01:14] we give their life for the gospel now so
[1:01:17] we go ahead and we realize that she's
[1:01:20] thinking about all of these things and
[1:01:22] all the planes that she's making you
[1:01:24] know for the wedding and everything can
[1:01:27] and not even thinking about you know
[1:01:30] what kind of or trouble she's I mean
[1:01:31] library Burnham says she tried to live a
[1:01:34] clean life I mean it was a proudful
[1:01:37] thing for that generation now like at
[1:01:39] the age that we are living in praise the
[1:01:41] Lord Amen well you know what young women
[1:01:45] I will get out of setting the Asian and
[1:01:48] you know yeah you know and and what and
[1:01:51] all of the things that is happening but
[1:01:52] let's just go down this road a little
[1:01:54] bit so we realize here here is married
[1:01:59] posed to Joseph making all their planes
[1:02:03] but God in the back of his mind nor in
[1:02:07] their there is always a reproach that
[1:02:10] goes with his word amen
[1:02:14] he knew that there is a reproach that
[1:02:17] goes with his word maybe your life would
[1:02:22] have been better if you were now safe in
[1:02:26] a way that the world would think better
[1:02:29] praise the Lord but when you are
[1:02:33] identified with this word there's a Mac
[1:02:37] of Jesus Christ on you and there is a
[1:02:41] reproach that goes with the world and we
[1:02:45] are glad to bear his reproach so God
[1:02:49] will raise up a man they have heart and
[1:02:53] experience he will not raise up a novice
[1:02:57] he's bringing his greatest gift into the
[1:03:01] world if it was just maybe in nineteen
[1:03:07] years or bored or a twenty year or boy
[1:03:09] I'm telling he's going to dumb married
[1:03:11] and be gone pick up another woman by
[1:03:13] eros a girl who get a man that that is
[1:03:16] the spirit he has been there done that
[1:03:23] praise the Lord
[1:03:25] God don't makes mistakes
[1:03:29] amen
[1:03:32] now there were many young men over there
[1:03:36] in Nazareth Judea and all of those
[1:03:38] places what Mary saw in this man
[1:03:42] there has been Mahara before he said you
[1:03:45] said there was anyway you have already
[1:03:46] live his life but it was God's design
[1:03:50] God design it that way and the Bible
[1:03:54] said he was a just man he was a just man
[1:04:03] it takes a just man to protect the Word
[1:04:06] of God it takes a just man to Pope the
[1:04:15] desire of the world above his necessary
[1:04:18] needs praise the Lord he was a just man
[1:04:27] that's what the scripture says we do
[1:04:31] over there a little bit just man make it
[1:04:35] not a sheen that's what we want to talk
[1:04:38] about tonight
[1:04:40] the Bible says uh-uh eros Mary come over

[1:05:05] never been with a man the Holy Spirit is
[1:05:10] going to overshadow you praise the Lord
[1:05:14] now you would think that and people they
[1:05:17] have the promise of the Messiah it would
[1:05:20] have been an easy thing for mirror to
[1:05:22] see and everybody's glory to God God has
[1:05:25] for fairies word it would have been you
[1:05:28] would think that it should have been an
[1:05:31] easy thing even Mary herself just
[1:05:35] reading the scripture and she said unto
[1:05:39] the angel be it unto me according to
[1:05:42] your word think
