TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the Tabernacle where by God's grace and by his help I have tried hard by the scriptures to set in order the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ as we believe at the brandham Tabernacle the first thing I wish to say is that the pastor is always in full charge of the Tabernacle in my absence and I only look to the pastor when I return so he is in full charge to change or to do whatsoever he thinks it's best under the leadership ship of the Holy Spirit while I am aw we believe in an Apostolic Church teaching Apostolic blessings for people of this day we believe in the Full Gospel and believe that all of the signs and the Wonders that was spoken of by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returned we believe in those things and believe that they are to be set in order that the church has its order and each church has its Doctrine and Order and discipline our church has no members as joiners we believe that the whole Universal Church of the Living God is our brothers and sisters and all people are always welcome regardless of what denomination they belong to at the ram Tabernacle at 8th and 10th Street in Jeffersonville Indiana we believe in justification by faith Romans 51 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drink drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and that's we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 for Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gates and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we're now living and we also believe that after the person has been Sanctified the unclean habits is gone from the person he's a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes as a filling of the believer and then when the believer it's just as many times as I have taught it like picking up a glass out in the chicken yard justification is picking it up ready for to use it with a purpose in heart that's what God does to a sinner he's still filthy then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service and the the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the holy spirit is put in the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is uh not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent where that signs and wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 manifest themselves through this believer when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the gift I believe at the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance that when we're born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god and that before we even become adults while we're yet children the gifts that we have of God is in a stand and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into operation but we have them in to the ending such as teachers and apostles and and Prophets and Gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual gifts according to 1 Corinthians 12 now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in ever local church although in such we have found throughout the world that there's much fanaticism hooked along with people who profess to be uh Apostolic Believers just as they are other ERS and so forth we have Fanatics that's been all along we've had those Through the Ages they had it in the apostolic day and as Paul said there that how that some had come and persuade them away after other doctrines and so forth but in his own teaching he said if an angel from heaven would teach anything else and what he had taught let him be a curse so we as the brandom Tabernacle at 8th and 10th Street year tried to follow the teachings of the New Testament or we believe that Jesus Christ being the Son of God and Paul the Apostle was a called and chosen vessel by election of God to be sent to the Gentile Church to set it in order now we believe and water baptism in the Bram Tabernacle by IMM mercing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the apostolic uh teaching of the Bible and may all members of the uh comers to the Bram Tabernacle who desire such May at any time requesting to be immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus May consult the pastor if they have repented and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ the pastor will as soon as possible even then if he can baptize them immediately this does bring them into the Fellowship of the Believers we believe that by water baptism we are brought into a fellowship but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought into the members being members of the body of Jesus Christ which is all over the world now another thing that we believe that the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all now we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating in the church which we covet and desire that the people who are gifted by the Spirit come and worship with us now in most places we find that when these gifts in the people the people does not understand how and when to use these gifts and in doing so they only bring a reproach which we believe would be just what Satan could do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers and so forth afraid of this wonderful blessing that God has given to the church in these days Paul said when there come a stranger Among Us and we've all speak with tongue won't the man go away and say we were mad but if one would prophesy and make knowing the secret of the heart then they would fall down and say truly God is with you now we believe that the spiritual gift among the Believers is the order of the day we cannot believe that a man can preach under inspiration and then or be an inspired teacher and then Deni the gift of healing or the gift of Prophecy or speaking with tongues or interpretation of tongues or any of these other gifts so therefore here is my belief in God's word the way the brandom Tabernacle at e and Pin Street here in Garrisonville should be operated I think the first thing and believe that these things which I say is essential and must be carried out in this manner in the Bram Tabernacle for it to prosper in the Lord and if at any time these this would be questioned the person who is in question about it may consult me if they cannot get to the pastor or they could consult the pastor if I'm home off for some of the trips I'll be glad to to help either the Ley or the pastor at any time and these things are scripturally and I believe it's the order of the church I I think first that every member or every worshipper of the brandom Tabernacle should be so much in Divine love with each other until it would their hearts would long for each other when they have to go away to lead each other at the service at night I am a True Believer in Divine love the Apostle Paul said that was evidence of the Holy Spirit by this man all man will know your my disciples said Jesus when you have love one for the other and we believe that it's the love of God that sent Jesus Christ to the Earth to die for us all God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but would have everlasting life and the everlasting life here is God's own life because we become Sons and Daughters of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the Seed of Abraham and gives us the faith that Abraham had when he believed God before he was even circumcised now the next thing we believe that these worshippers should meet together these gifted people such as tongues and the people who gets Revelations and interpretations and so forth these members or these Believers rather should come together at least 45 minutes or an hour before the services ever began the church should be open early and the Believers come together on these nights and at least 45 minutes to an hour before the services began I believe that brandham Tabernacle at all times should have a spirit filled pianist who would come early filled with the Holy Spirit and and would play softly very softly Spiritual music such as down at the cross where the Savior died down there for cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name something on that order near my God to thee Rock of Ages cleff or mean or near The Cross or something on that order softly slowly as he is meditating constantly on the Holy Spirit he or she whichever it may be then I believe that the worshippers coming in should be met and their hang their coats and hats show to their seats with hospitality that only ushers or deacons filled with the Holy Spirit can do and in love to see the Church of the Living God go on these worshippers should not talk one with another and be talking across and making noise in the church they should come together first slip up in silent prayer perhaps at the altar for a few moments no loud praying interrupt someone else silent prayer you're in worship let that soak in worship Him in your spirit then return to your seat or you do not have to go to the altar just go in and get your seat sit down Listen To The Music close your eyes bow your head and be in silent worshiping God all along then if the spirit should reveal something to another or or someone be filled with the spirit to a place where they would speak with tongues then this person should rise and give the message and everyone must hold their peace until the interpretation comes when the interpretation comes it must not be just quoting of scripture or something has no meaning it must be a message directed to the church or we think that it would be in the flesh we see so much of that and now I believe the the spirit was to speak only for the edifying of the church and now it would be a message something on this order Perhaps Perhaps the people are gathering by this time some sick people has come in perhaps there's a man laying paralyzed or something you've never seen him before but when the interpretation would come it would be something in this order when the interpretation of the one who had just spoke would say uh well thus saith the Lord the man who is in our midst has come from a certain certain place and describ the place and would say that he is paralyzed because three or 4 years ago or whatever it may the case may be he did something evil like left his wife and children and run off from him and he's fell from a trussle or something like that order and got hurt and paralyzing thus sayith the Lord if he will repent of that and will promise to go to his wife and reconcile himself to her then he shall be healed now and return to his family and then before anyone says anything there must be at least two or more men or peoples in the building who are spiritually solid and gospel Doctrine who has a good discernment of spirit shall rise up and say that it is of the Lord and if this thing doesn't take place then tongue should not be mentioned in the church if the person speaks with tongues Paul said there be no interpreter and so forth let's stand speak at home or wherever they may be or they're only blessing themselves and it's not for edification of the church and this person after speaking in the interpretation and then two or three judges according to St Paul's doctrine of the Bible that it must be judged by two or three judges then let the person and whom it calls upon to go and maybe it might designate a certain person or a pastor or someone to go lay hands on this person and it it's sick or Afflicted and they will be healed then let the pastor or the other person whoever it may be that was designated by the Holy Spirit to go pray the prayer of faith let them go and minister to the person according to what the spirit has said then at that time the person and whatever the Holy Spirit has said it shall take place immediately then just as the Holy Spirit has given then the people could rej and be thankful and praise and worship God because God wants to be worshiped then they must then they must bow their heads and be in prayer again to see if there be another message that the holy spirit will want these gifts to manifest before and then if any time that a person would speak in tongues and interpret and the the judges would send the person to take to do whatever it was said to be done and it doesn't come to pass then the whole group of them shall go to the Altar and there pray God to take that spirit away from him because there's no one would want a spirit like that we would know it would be false and would be of the enemy and not of God because God can only tell truth let that be clearly understood by the church before you start this this new order then perhaps maybe it would be something like this the message would say to a certain brother maybe say would live by a railroad track or something to have him to move out because there's going to be a wreck on the road or something or anything in that order and let the judges after they give the church permission to speak uh to exercise this uh message that just went forth if their judgment is it's of God then watch and see if it comes to pass and if it comes to pass thank God and be very graceful graceful in your hearts toward him and give him praise and worship and be humble Above All Things be humble don't never get yourself puffed up to a place where you know more about it in your pastor or the church that you're worshiping in if you get to that place then I'd advise each one of you to get another place to worship with because I am asking the pastor never to permit anything outside of the Bible order a way we have seen it here in the church and then we want these gifts to be operated and in place and the worshippers if it's carried on correctly according to the word you'll see a mighty wonderful Church in operation for our Lord Jesus Christ now then the next thing shall take place will be that if these people who have that gets out of order uh during these times that a deacon or some uh Usher that's filled with the Holy Ghost and got lots of Grace in their heart shall go to the person reverently fatherly light and shall correct them in this manner or the pastor whoever it may be which would be more essential for the deacons to do so for the pastor at this time while these spiritual services are going on should be in the prayer room or somewhere a Praying these messages then if there's no messages going on no Revelations then the people would be privileged if they desired to raise and give a testimony a testimony only for the glory of God they're not bound to do this but testimonies should be given before the message or any song service starts or anything testimonies in these worship services do you understand church that in doing this you have the whole church in the spirit of worship before the word comes in to be taught then the Holy Spirit gets in the word and manifest God through the word to be a confirmation of your worship now then after this uh time for the pastor to come on if messages are going on say the pastor should come out at zachar say 7:30 and or quarter of 8 and if these messages are still going on before the pastor comes to his out of his study or wherever he may to take his place at the platform some brothers should instruct him because the Saints know that when the pastor comes on the platform it's his time then for the service and that gives plenty ample time for all the manifestations of the gift to bring the spirit of God into the the congregation and if any unbeliever would happen to be there be disorderly a kind-hearted person would go to them such as an usher or a deacon and would tell them that they would they would ask to be kept reverent or be reverent while the service are is an order because the spirit is in the building and the gifts of God are being made man manest for the edifying of the church and this person must be told in love and not harshly unless it would come to a place where they were drinking or some disobedient or something other that would be interfering with the worship of of the Lord uh which the gifts are then uh being manifest then the person should will should be led out to one side to one of the back rooms or somewhere and be talked to and dealt with kindly now while the pastor comes to the platform as the pastor comes to the platform I would suggest as the brandom Tabernacle here that the pastor lead the congregation and at least one or two good songs for we have found it so that when too many are trying to operate in the church it brings on only trouble I would suggest as I did while I was pastoring at the church I led the songs myself and I feel that it would be a good thing as the pastor did so [Music] him [Music]
