[5:12] loved you they'll give to you
[5:14] I've seen them all over there like what
[5:16] was it quickly
[5:18] John the Revelator was still full of
[5:20] quickly power and stood up and seen the
[5:22] ends from the beginning Isaiah was full
[5:25] of quick
[5:26] the Millennium and all quickening powder
[5:29] if the spirit that raised up Christ or
[5:31] the dead dwelling you yeah
[5:34] mortal body remember they're quickly
[5:36] power look what we see in this day the
[5:38] quick new power has come to us the open
[5:41] Seven Seals what was that the
[5:44] intelligence of a man no the quickly
[5:46] power of God
[5:48] the quickening power of God foretold
[5:50] this would take place
[5:52] quickly power God made the world testify
[5:54] to it it's the truth the age of the Lord
[5:56] but told you was around that pillar Fox
[5:59] quickening power let the world testify
[6:01] that is the truth and in that she didn't
[6:03] know what it was and we you just look
[6:05] this way it is our Lord
[6:07] he is the one who opened those seals he
[6:10] is those sealed for the whole word of
[6:12] God is Christ
[6:14] and Christ is the seal that was opened
[6:16] one is opening of Steel Man revealing
[6:18] Christ
[6:19] and the Very seven angels which
[6:21] represent the seven churches all
[6:23] completed and we couldn't even see it
[6:25] they didn't they took the picture
[6:29] Supreme judge
[6:32] showing that he's Alpha and Omega
[6:35] the beginning
[6:37] what identification greatly power did
[6:40] that to us great the power let the sea
[6:43] is coming christian powers that's just
[6:45] some deaths alive quickly powered gives
[6:48] discernment to know what's wrong with
[6:49] him what to do what you have done and
[6:51] what you ought not have done what you
[6:52] should have done and what you will be
[6:54] creating power all these things our lord
[6:57] Jesus is the poor quickly power he was
[6:59] all of it together
[7:01] he is so full of quickly power he said
[7:03] this
[7:04] you destroy this body and I'll raise it
[7:06] up in three days
[7:08] talk about confidence and quickness
[7:11] destroy this body and I'll read this
[7:14] Temple and I'll bring it up in three
[7:15] days why why do you say that he knew
[7:18] that it was written of him
[7:21] see it is written in by the word of God
[7:23] which could not fail the word says I
[7:27] will not suffer my holy one because to
[7:29] see corruption neither will our lead be
[7:31] soul in hell
[7:33] and he knows that quickness power would
[7:35] raise him up that there wouldn't be one
[7:37] fell corrupt he said you destroy this
[7:40] Temple I'll bring it back again in three
[7:42] days why he was prophecy
[7:45] the word of God
[7:47] and prophecy if it's true word of God
[7:50] cannot fail
[7:52] in the same prophecy and word of God
[7:54] that says raise him up
[7:57] as that we're already raised with him
[8:01] the word set feared up
[8:05] it is written
[8:06] that's the spirit that is now within him
[8:10] now in us also quickens our moral body
[8:13] Paradise friends
[8:15] the s-o-n is up
[8:17] it's not enough
[8:18] now look at Transfiguration with
[8:21] everyone represented there there was the
[8:23] living saints that raptured that was
[8:26] Elijah then and there and there stood
[8:28] Moses the dead Saints repre it also
[8:31] pulled them had quickly power while the
[8:33] one died and the other didn't die
[8:34] they're all there
[8:35] notice oh look what we're now seeing in
[8:39] these thy States the same thing as he
[8:41] promised John 14 12. now look
[8:45] people say you came to have power no no
[8:49] we're just like to have it
[8:50] non-transfiguration see certainly we do
[8:52] our plain power
[8:54] what we like like they was on the now
[8:57] Transfiguration
[8:58] they wasn't saying more would you say
[8:59] serious do I am in a disciples that's
[9:01] you I am to who I am you know what
[9:04] happened notice they've seen Jesus
[9:07] glorified
[9:08] that's all they want to see represented
[9:10] Jesus glorified and so into today we all
[9:14] try to be some big person
[9:16] we don't care what the people say about
[9:18] us
[9:19] our name ain't nothing it's his name
[9:21] our life is nothing to see his life
[9:24] it's his power not our power and there's
[9:27] only one thing that we love to do is see
[9:29] him glorified how can it be when he's
[9:31] glorified in Us by his resurrection it's
[9:34] in US
[9:36] we see him represented again as he was
[9:39] today did you get that
[9:41] see our desire is not to be glorified
[9:44] our desire is not something any our
[9:48] desire is not through some church or
[9:50] make more than a Sunday school or try to
[9:52] bring in all ties push in offer a picnic
[9:56] party or bring Stars buttons or
[9:57] something else like that that's not our
[9:58] design our desire is to see him
[10:01] glorified
[10:03] Glory by what not with self-pride but in
[10:07] us our lives to prove he is alive and
[10:10] living in us if I can get myself out of
[10:12] the way oh and William Branham not even
[10:14] thought of and you're not even thought
[10:15] of so we can see Jesus glorified among
[10:18] us see him that's our desire that's the
[10:21] quick gives us a quickie time and it
[10:23] gives us joy to know that we are with
[10:26] him for flesh and bone of him being the
[10:29] Bride of him
[10:44] we are Redeemed by him and now risen
[10:48] with him
[10:49] that's what Easter means to the people
[10:51] risen with him notice now we have his
[10:55] spirit in us the abstract D fully paid
[11:00] oh you don't say well I hope I make it
[11:03] you've already made it amen
[11:05] ah we'll make it up already

[11:10] not me him
[11:12] self I don't care what she says Eric he
[11:15] made it for me that's all I don't really
[11:18] care about I just I just want to see him
[11:20] manifested how can you do it calm him
[11:22] down no he's in you
[11:23] okay he's in you well then Lord if I get
[11:26] myself out of the way you can manifest
[11:28] myself how can you do it because you are
[11:30] named itself all that the father has
[11:32] given me will come
[11:34] notice Glory with all that evidence
[11:37] which is not for you
