it was good to see them and fellowship with them so we just thank the Lord amen yeah we had we had good fellowship with all of those Brothers it's going to be back home praise the Lord and uh we just remember all the needs and Jordan just told me about a uh like prayer need a specific as we leave her up in prayer and and we just we just pray that the grace of God will just be with all of his children amen school to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seated a little bit before we go into what we want to do tonight is just 11 minutes past our time here but uh uh is is good to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord and I want to find out that we ended the uh man running away from the presence of the Lord that we ended that tape let's go on Sunday okay I got the feeling of faith praise the Lord and what I wanted to do tonight I wanted to kind of catch up some few points on that tape that brother Brandon County for emphasized on now you have to remember it is the beginning of a series that led to the mauritian Devils uh message so brother Branham was kind of for building up in and preparing the people before he preached marriage and davosa uh uh the weekend and then he will also preach the message who uh who is this uh matricide so uh we want to we we will follow the series uh and uh and see if the law will be able to bless us to to recap every time we come to an end of a tip that's what I wanted to do today but uh I was praying uh this morning and then uh you know kind of travel back and and had a little bit of a tough time to sleep last night tired and and different things and and uh and you know the enemy always try to profit when your body is weak amen praise the Lord he always tried to profit and and want to frustrate your nighting you know and just put you in there so uh but then you know I uh sometime in the morning I was praying and and then uh I remember last Wednesday we had a wonderful prayer meeting praise the Lord wonderful prayer meeting that led into uh uh uh brother Stephen ajaro testimony he gave and then speaking about you know uh uh against all unclean Spirit giving power the man he picks that right off from the quickening power message that brother Valentin Prayed For Us Praise the Lord and uh and sometimes it's wonderful when the Holy Ghost can do that amen because that's exactly what the gift's supposed to do they give supposed to be able to pick up from from uh from where the Holy Ghost is dealing with the people so uh and then he brought that message and uh uh you know and and he he gave us an assignment I don't know who all had the courage to go back and and look at uh scriptures or quotes on unclean Spirit anyone was able to take the courage to do that praise the Lord and uh and and uh I I I think that it was it was a wonderful it was a wonderful uh uh message it was a wonderful hesitation encouragement especially to the time that we we are living in so uh uh uh and they have to pray meditating and then things started to kind of for opening up to me on that on that uh on that subject as well and and so I'm I'm caught between the Rock and the high place tonight amen praise the Lord so But whichever way we will ask the Holy Spirit to have his way praise the Lord amen whichever way we will have the Holy Spirit ask the holy spirit will have his way for the few meanings that is left before Us Praise the Lord but what I was thinking about on that thought of uh of of the unclean Spirit if I if I'm not able to do that tonight I will I will be able to pick that up on uh on on Sunday and but it would be it would be very good to to recap a little bit on uh a man running away from the presence of the Lord now you have to realize that the the inspiration behind that message was responsibility that was the inspiration praise the Lord think about all of the people all doing brother Brandon Ministry that was asking him questions about marriage in divorce you know so the responsibility was on was on this prophet to bring them the word knowing that he had good friends people that love him that were married divorced and and all of that so so the emphasis the the breaking ground of the marriage and the Vault series was responsibility I better bam closed the tip and he says uh uh uh uh uh if you if you disagree with me he says and you don't you don't regard what I say he says but remember that I have a responsibility praise the Lord he says I have a responsibility if you will own it respect the fact that I have a responsibility so that's that is that is the emphasis that's what the Holy Ghost was driving on honor that debt and uh uh you know we could talk about different things but the the important thing there is that we have to realize that life itself is a responsibility right praise the Lord life is a responsibility Christian Life is a responsibility we have been trusted with the Zoe God's own life he had trust us with his life we are in the we are in the condition just like Joseph was trusted to watch over Mary why she carried the Christ child in her womb there were many men on the Earth but God trusted Joseph and the Bible said he was a just man praise the Lord musicians I think have started like this so praise the Lord amen I thought we were going to sing again but it looks like I'm already in it so the Lord bless you and uh so so that's that's that's what that's what I want us to realize you know and there are a few things that brother Branham said there about responsibility amen about responsibility if you just think about it Christian Life is a life of responsibility we are responsible praise the Lord amen every one of us that come to this local assembly we are responsible for everything the happy in this building and around this building everything anything everything everything that happened around this property praise the Lord I remember the first time I I I started coming to church here and I came few service I would say sit some some wedding back or I would say somewhere there at that time we had we just had only two you know we had an eye yet and you know two separate roles and uh uh and and quickly that I knew that uh uh we you know there was there was there was nobody staying in the in the foyer there when uh whenever we had a service going on you know at the time we were playing having uh video Services tip services and uh and every time I hear the door sign I would step out now we had a little monitor in The Sound Room and we had a uh a camera out there so that was directly connected to the monitor so every time a person comes through the door uh uh Albert Jones will see them but I did not know praise the Lord amen every time uh uh you know or someone as soon as I hear the door I would just step out so uh uh bless his heart brother John one day after service yeah he he met me outside he says he say Hey Brother uh it looks like you are a chef nominated deacon laughs I said I told him I said I said well you know for the fact that uh you know my my family do come here and there is nobody out there I don't mind being a chef nominated deacon praise the Lord amen but I said there to say it's uh uh it's a responsibility on our shoulder let us not come to church and just for our hands you know and I mean just come which of course we we believe we have passed that you know just to come in and perform our religious Duty you know wow our religious duty is more than the singing the preaching and receiving the word the Bible says we must provoke one another you know uh uh to uh to Godliness and righteousness and uh and so that in one sense gave us uh the responsibility that we have to one another Amen to encourage one another and uh you know encourage one another so uh that's that's what I wanted for us to kind of recap a little bit we might we might shoot back to the message and pick up some few things there but before I do that let me let me just run uh let me just run over something quickly here I might come back to that uh I might come back to that she's a cartoon I realized I didn't send anything back yet I just have only one coat I ship it back there to you now and that's what I will read tonight is from the message the house and uh I would pick on that a little bit tonight cheers to just to kind of give you an idea when we uh maybe Sunday if the Lord will you know we keep the channel open and and think that we should we should continue in that line we will continue and uh also I wanted to uh I wanted to uh remind us or announce that the last Sunday of the month we will have a convenience service for some reason this year uh most uh we have few weddings on the first weekend of the of the month and and coupled of those weddings have been having me to to be away there's a family that used to be with us there in the Ivory Coast uh you know uh very uh wonderful family they were very encouraging supportive you know when you as a as a Young Man you know you have people there of great starters and uh not so much of great status in a way that the world will look at it but you find you know responsible people and admire people in in you know and and the kind of trust and respect you know uh the grace of God upon your life it humbles you you know sometimes we kind of forget it in our head and we think that it make us something else but that humble us so this family was very very uh encouraging to us it was a blessing to me to see people of of their age and and you know and what they you know they were doing in this life and you know to to have take to us so one of the girls will be getting married on the first weekend in October and the parents are hoping to make it you know but then uh you know uh the the choose to talk to me just to prepare myself to to get down there if they if they are not able to get their visa on time so uh we will we will remind ourselves again maybe the last weekend there in in September we will uh we have a community service permitting there Sunday evening they have a community service this long weekend also we were away for the wedding there in Chicago and uh it's a dear sister traveling from Nigeria to John her Houseman year the uh the pastor got in touch with us and wanted to make sure that we get her to a place where she can be able to go to church and all of that so her daughter was getting married and she asked that we come in and support them in the past I also wanted for us to preach they have a very small group there that he he runs from his house but this time since there were a lot of people in town he rented a church so we can have a service there so that was also a blessing we thank the Lord for that amen so uh but let's let's get today I was just trying to uh uh distract you a little bit yeah why I wait for uh our sisters to be able to get get this code let's just read this it's from the message the house uh rather than that uh work on it the way that I I want to present it but we will just read it then he was Burbank was asking the brother to read the next question concerning the three unclean Spirit now this is in 1961. he says that come out of Revelation come out of the mouth of the Fall Spirit and the dragon and so forth now we are going to get that in our study now that's that's what I wanted for us to study on because I believe that it was a beautiful thing you know that the way the Holy Spirit kind of for there with us last Wednesday you know when and uh and we we read Revelation 1 John falling down at the feet of the Lord Jesus and you know in the end of the spirit you know the Holy Spirit have one of our sister falling down at the feet of the Lord Jesus now so you see uh the the thing about that also that caught my mind is that um we have uh we have had all sorts of wrong messages that goes with that you know and and I think uh the Lord wants to bring us to such a place of Liberty you know sometimes we we struggle we hold ourselves you know uh uh and then uh because we don't want to be misunderstood we don't want to thank their people you know we think that maybe we get a sin in our life that's why we are crying or uh you know something going wrong with us that's the reason why we are yelling all over the building you know it can go both ways it can go both ways but when the people of God are ready to to uh you know enjoy the liberty of the spirit amen if the spirit is dealing with your heart you want to stream and say thank you Jesus scream and say thank you Jesus praise the Lord those things bring healing you know because they are not normal it is not a pre-plained thing praise the Lord if you try to impersonate it God will embarrass you because God do not like impersonation praise the Lord but I mean I think that God want to bring us to that place and break us from our fears you know uh uh and break us uh uh you know uh and and and and and because those things does not happen sometimes you know uh uh the the kind of for troubled our children they think what what is that you know what was that you know and uh and it must not be a good attitude for children to sit in church and live when someone gets under the spirit you you might get yourself in trouble praise the Lord you know so uh I know the church were today have abused those things you know and because of the abuse that is out there now the people that you enjoy that Liberty of the spirit are now refraining themselves and and holding to the seating you know uh so much but and and that's the reason why I started to think about the importance on teaching uh on clean spirit you'll realize in the scripture that unclean Spirit were never healed the person was healed but unclean Spirit was always cast out in Old Testament the same thing with leprosy there is nowhere that leprosy was healed leprosy where it cleanse praise the Lord now so if you if you get into that and start to and start to study that you will realize that there is a reason why the reason there is because that nature of the unclean spirit was breached into uh the the human nature through the fall praise the Lord amen through the fall and uh and and it it kind of for me uh uh uh a two-tail of our being it's made of two-thirds of our being David said in sin that my mother conceived me coming to the word speaking lies so you see uh uh and and that's what sometimes people struggle you know uh because there are some things that runs down in our family and as and as a child of God a Son of God a daughter of God the Holy Ghost want to bring you to a realization for you to realize that you are a child of God born of The Incorruptible seed which is the word of God and then every other thing what are you know if your father used to do it your grandfather used to do it you need to cast it out now so it's it's at a place where the Holy Ghost bring us to that realization to protect this territory because the thing about it that is that when you cast it out it will come back again praise the Lord and what happens to people uh uh uh uh during the ages is there the you know they go to a Revival all the prayer then the Lord give them a breakthrough and they feed free from a certain Spirit and the just thing is all to it praise the Lord and then and then sometimes they are now watching they are now being careful what the moment you get into the environment the atmosphere is is all around it Jesus said is seeking to come back to make you worse than you was before then pretty soon you start to experience that then what is doing there is is trying to discredit the work of God in your life say you were just excited there was nothing to that see see you read back in the same old thing sure praise the Lord so from the womb to the Grave all to the rapture from the womb to the Grave or to the body change until we leave this body and step into our new body it's a constant fight that's what better brand preached the message the greater battle ever fought is a constant fight that's the reason why a Christian is somebody that is very conscious of their life the conscious of their environment their conscious of everything that is happening around them that's what make a Christian Life a life of responsibility you see why this this is important for us to study it you know and then Lord the Lord started dealing with my heart on this this morning I said I was saying wow you know I've you know I thought about it I knew some of the things but it never came to mind to me like the way they came to me you know so right from Genesis 3 right from Genesis 3. and makes took place the Lord now so uh we will read we read yet a little bit and we are going to get get there in our study now the three unclean spirit is the three is in praise the Lord now he's saying the three unclean spirit is the three ism but after the seals he make us to know that the you know the the that on that unclean spirit is the trinitarian doctrine now the reason there is there you we will understand that because because all of those Mysteries were hidden in the seals amen we have to know there are three major powers praise the Lord three major evil powers that control the word is a political power a religious power and demonic that is that is Satan forces that is says uh uh that's that's the that's the Dynamics of the enemy so yeah brother Brandon is showing the three don't clean spirits as agents which is under the political power because every government on the Earth is Birth by one of these isms praise the Lord amen you will see the beauty of Faith as we go down uh I don't know if I'm uh you know I'm kind of staring the water here I should have just gone into my he says here uh the three-year unclean spirit is the three reasons let me type it for you now and you will see where it started where it begins see there was communism uh Fascism and Nazism they were Spirits communism is a spirit it gets on you praise the Lord right it gets on you it's a spirit it is something like that that really isn't it but it will be three Spirit just like that which there was kind of a forerunner now what is he saying now those three ISM was a forerunner it went ahead but there was a religious play behind it it was for running something of course you know is in catalism I want to get get a few things on their street before I say it to be sure that uh uh that I know what but is the three this is a three spirit just like communism just talking about the three isms remember I told you I said it it will be it will be a thing that will that would take place all wind up in communism the three will all wind up in communism and that's and that's where it's done that's the same thing it will be it will be at that time it will be three unclean spirits that we go forth I really truly believe right now just to kind of uh outline it if you don't mind if I add a little more to it when I get to explain it well you didn't explain it all together down there that's right now he's talking about in the in the future that when he gets down to explain this here's what I think I believe it's a spirit the the Sleepy version the confederation of churches Judaism on the rejecting of Christ did you think about it those people waiting for their Messiah praise the Lord that they could outrightly reject him now it was not the radical Jews that crucified Jesus it was the religious Jews what will make them do that thinking the very psalm in the temple why couldn't they see when he said my God my God why have they are forsaken me why couldn't they see it right it's a spirit it's a spirit young people that's why we don't want nothing less than the Holy Ghost we don't want a religious spirit don't just get excited you need a birth you need an experience with God your excitement won't carry you anywhere far praise the Lord see he mentioned even the foolish virgin what happened they are living clean life amen clean decent Christian life but they cannot see the revealed word for their hour they can't see it it's now your smartness that open your eyes to this message it's the mercy of God God being rich in Merced to you you think you have all the time on your hands to be running God around the house like a little child these people were preparing for their Messiah so that's that's what he's trying to say the confederation of churches they will have to take a spirit to come upon these people right they are not doing it against God they are doing it in the name of God praise the Lord when a person can take a scripture they can take a scripture to take a court sincerely they are they are anointed they can use that to break up families break up praise the Lord is strong and it's all on clean spirit God look at it as unclean spirit praise the Lord amen the devil will make us to struggle with evil thought and lost and and filthiness in our flesh and all of that and he he will he will he will he will narrow that down all of those things are unclean Spirit anything that is now glorifying God is an unclean spirit but you see the most deceiving one is when he can hook you up in a religious spirit that you can go seven days fast 21 days and keep yourself before God praise the Lord and you are seeking the face of God in your mind you are seeking the face of God you are getting close to God sure and you are just sincerely worshiping the devil opening yourself up to more deception you come from out of there you just saw why and radical now I've seen God God revealed himself to me I can I don't want anybody to talk to me why because you're coming from before the burning bush you're coming from the same ground where Moses was on we have met God goodness may God help us brother Branham says just like the Indians you take one step you wash ten times and make sure that everything is a calling to the word of God praise the Lord that will not even be time for us to get to running away from the presence of the Lord but yeah the holy the Holy Ghost kind of for interrupting me with this with this thought this morning and uh it's very interesting praise the Lord amen it's not just you know a baptized in Jesus name I received brother Branham as a prophet you know I tell you the devil believed that man was a prophet Satan knows that William Branham was the prophet of God for this age no matter what the critics say the devil knows better praise the Lord I believe it's a spirit he says the sleeping virgin the confederation of churches which is the World Council of churches they will all be driven together by that spirit what will unite them that they will forget about their doctrines praise the Lord amen they will forget about their doctrines the Buddhists the Melody I mean Muslims and every one of them all because we are worshiping the same God and they will just be so happy that we are now United what will bring them to death what will blind them so much that they would not be able it's an influence from those unclean spirit praise the Lord The Same Spirit that gets on people they will be blowing drugs through their body the no is destroying them but they don't have the power to set himself freely and when these unclean Spirit comes on you you don't have the power to set yourself free people can argue through right in the face of God's word praise the Lord Moses getting down there to Egypt he gets down there and he display the word of God the power of God he speaks those things into existence in the fourth plague he says uh uh uh uh magician comes to him and tell him and said Pharaoh this is the hand of God this is the finger praise the Lord the Bible says Moses warned that the akatos will die go back and read Genesis I mean Exodus the Bible says there were some of the Egyptians that believed what Moses said and they took their capitals for safekeeping the ones that did not believe the akatos died praise the Lord but after he sees that the Bible says yet his heart was hiding what was had in his heart it was a spirit praise the Lord Mikhail the prophet said unto Ahab by the vision there was a spirit that raised up before the Lord he said let me go and deceive those Prophets 400 Prophets received by a live spirit and lying spirit is an unclean spirit that was the first spirit that manifested itself in eating it was a spirit of life they see all of those 400 men that they could even slap the prophet in his face shut up we have the word of God praise the Lord you see that's the reason why people we need the watching of the water by the word amen we need this war this word to wash us daily we need to be in the word and believe in the promise of God identifying our thoughts and our weaknesses and claiming God's promises that's how you take bath in the word you have to identify your thoughts and your weaknesses and then you find a promise and wash yourself with it praise the Lord amen amen don't just go and jump under the shower and be excited you know get some scrub [Laughter] and watch yourself and say God get this out of my life this thing will destroy me get it out of my life God so yeah brother Bennett is identifying that all of these things the foolish virgin the the sleeping virgin he said the confederation of churches Judaism on the rejection of Christ the Jews that rejected it and catalism that claim The Universal Church because you see where it comes out it comes out of it comes out of the false prophet out of the mouth of the false prophets which were properly from out of the Beast see and all that all that were it comes out of you can see the the background where it is and that and that's the the three unclean spirit that I will set the whole word to Armageddon praise the Lord amen you don't believe that it will set the whole word you don't believe that just one lie we all put marks over our faces the whole word we just thought that uh you know uh I mean we couldn't even find papers in the in the in the store to buy praise the Lord I'm not saying that coronavirus was alive I'm saying the way it was dead with are we together see this and that's them three unclaimed spirits so you see it I pray that the Lord help us who will be able to study that and you can run that down to uh a Genesis through the scripture to just be able to look at that and just see how you know it will encourage us to be able to rely on the promise on the Promises of God Amen to be able when Jesus says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God I mean you're not just reading the word because uh you know is is your duty to read it but you are you are you are looking for the promises you are applying those promises you can re-exit and take some of those promises Lord the same way you got it your children you are with us you can take those promises daily because it's out there this is all around us so we move out there from uh from the political realm over to the to the religious stream which is the church and down is in uh uh a kind of a demonic reign and uh and then we see that you can take that we'll look at that also Revelation chapter six you look at you know the uh uh the White House rather uh the red horse rather the black house rather you know all of those things were they were all the power the power that were behind praise the Lord amen and and one of the things that the prophet said that that is that is with those on clean spirit he sees the nature of the frog is to always look to his past is to always look to his past as long as the devil can keep you in your past he can always have an influence over your life you can never guess to your Victory you can never get to the promise you can never guess to your inheritance for getting those things in the past Paul says I press unto the mark of the High Calling praise the Lord so we see here with a few minutes that is left here I think I have three minutes what what can I do with it amen I don't uh I can preach you sweat tonight amen but I've known that it was it was a prayer meeting that the thought was birth honor I wanted to bring it tonight on this prayer meeting but then I was I was very sure that uh there was there was the conclusion of uh a man running away from the presence of the Lord uh so uh I will I will Dash back to the to that message and uh and be able to pick up some few things there uh praise the Lord I kind of for um then most of my the highlights of my thoughts on my phone so uh I'll see if the Lord will be able to to uh help me remember some of that now you see so uh brother Branham uh just like I said this was the beginning of the series to the ma to to marriage and Davos which of which of course there was also one of the mystery that was held under the seal the the right you know uh the truth about marriage and divorce the truth about marriage and divorce was a mystery that will heal under the seals because when uh when Adam fell uh he left the first Covenant that he was honored amen and a second Covenant was introduced so with the second with the second Covenant being introduced there is no way he could have that those are some of the thoughts were brother Branham saying it went back to the original owner so the truth about marriage in Davos was was always held under the seals so uh uh so you see that it was it was such a a responsibility that was on that was on broadband shoulder to be able to bring bring the subject paragraph 18 He said Each night if the Lord willing I think the lord has laid upon my heart a very definite message for the church I have been several days in prayer and I won't go I won't go into that because a great phenomenon happened the other day that was that lie that was over the mountain when those boys were at a gas station and someone said Brandon is up there amen there's all of those things that he was talking about and I'm anxious to tell you about it now the main subject uh uh he says which most of them barely said I've been calling was on marriage and divorce praise the Lord now you see because you you you you you see the the the the strictness of the word you see you know how much this ministry has brought us to a life of sincerity you know how much it has required sincerity and brought a brand name you know what I mean with with the with the grace of God and the gift of God in this life you know uh I mean it had to it had to be God to bring a man to that place praise the Lord so all of all of these people that were around brother Branham you know all of these people that had these different situations you can you can just imagine you know what are some of the things that they were you know that they were that they were going through you know why is this is this thing going to seem into hell because I have done this you know all of the questions that were going through their mind you know so uh you know Broadband has to talk how to kind of kind of for deal with this now so uh I just like I said the the emphasis here is on responsibility so I hope that uh uh we can be able to look at it that way and and and be able to to realize the other uh what what the Holy Spirit was trying to to bring to us out of this word okay I'm I'm just trying to drop I realize I've gone through most of my time here so okay in paragraph 48 that's where he really start kind of for introducing his his thought his inspiration we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody has got to face a certain responsibility so life is a responsibility we want the best of the service it is our responsibility praise the Lord you can't blame the musicians you can't blame the song leader you are also responsible for everything when you come through those doors and coming to the into into the into this place of worship you are responsible praise the Lord it's a responsibility that is on our hands and Brother Band would go and talk also he will he will bring it in the light of this which of course is he's kind of for creating the thought here he says when you come to choose a wife get married or choose a husband you have got to take a responsibility and then you must maybe uh you build a home a nice prayer to home and then remember as a married woman you got to think of the responsibility of raising children and you got to think of them pretty slick hands is going to have little dirty handprints all over the world then you got the responsibility of educating your children you got the responsibility of closing and feeling everything is a responsibility and it's so easy when the responsibility face us amen to shrink from them praise the Lord amen and when we just when we just look at life and uh uh I mean even even all of you going to college it's a responsibility to be able to choose a career you cannot just say well this other person is doing this I think that I think this other person is doing they know he says when the responsibility face us we we uh we shrink from them many times this is this is high to say but is the truth that ministers many times string from responsibility to for standing for the word of God standing for the truth word of God when they are confronted with it the strength from it praise the Lord I mean the the ministry is not just uh you know coming in and and having an audience with people or the you know being a good speaker it's a responsibility I mean sometimes you have to you you just you have to stand on that word until God can be able to give you a better understanding you have to stay with what truth is before you right and it don't make you popular either praise the Lord it'll make you popular so he's I mean bringing this thing here and making us to realize you know uh uh you know all of you young people as you are growing you know uh you you have to uh this this is this is a scripture that I I was uh looking at in the Book of Solomon uh uh in the Book of Proverbs sorry that Solomon said and I will I'll try to uh try to get diverse there for you you know uh uh Solomon is he said in in a in a proverb he says uh uh make your band which means the storage of your house he says before you build your house okay you have to build the band where you will keep all your food before you start building your house so that goes to say is you have to prepare yourself as a young man and as a young woman you have to prepare yourself spiritually amen the thing of where young people get to the places and it and it's not going crazy and they say they are worried they are depressed I'm not married I mean you are just you are just you just you are just killing yourself you're being lazy you are running from your present responsibility and you want a future responsibility when you are not there yet praise the Lord it is just the devil flipping the queen around and getting you confused there are things that you are responsible for right now is to pay attention to your schooling and get yourself a degree if you are a man you have to take care of your family so you want to you want to uh trust the Lord and you know be a Son of God and and think on what what I'm designed to do as a carrier because technically if the Lord I bless your hands to do something Kevin I mean he's surely going to give you a family right while worried about them if you don't have you don't have money to feed him praise the Lord you're not even paying your own rent then you worrying about when will I get married praise the Lord you see it's it's just it's Justified of uh bringing ourselves waking ourselves up and now to listen to The Devil's life he says everything is a responsibility now you see that's the all of those things accounted for you know uh uh all work in there you see so you see the Devil comes around with with that unclean Spirit of Lies praise the Lord what he want to do is that he just want to isolate you he want to praise you in your own mind and when you get prison in your mind your hands become weak your head is so big on your shoulder your hands become weak you can do anything you just lay down and you whine and you cry praise the Lord everything is a responsibility you know so that's that's what he was he was driving he was driving out and there was something he said go back again play the tape again and before we get to the next one you know he he he uh uh somewhere there in the in the message there he says uh uh uh this responsibility you know he talks about Luther how Luther had a responsibility Ludo was not afraid you know people were were afraid to face up with Luther truth when it comes forth of justification he talks about the Methodist you know he just talked about different men All Through the Ages it has always been there right it has always been there praise the Lord I mean even as children of God sometimes that's the reason why people misunder I mean mistake your age because even the way you dress the way you present yourself because you know you have a responsibility to represent Jesus Christ Wherever You Are that's the reason why you cannot have one life for church and another life for out there praise the Lord pretty soon you will just expose yourself you are just deceiving yourself praise the Lord we have a responsibility we all have a responsibility to carry this little group in the rapture amen if Jesus started we have your little ones Among Us children are being born children are raising up Among Us we have a responsibility you know I was thinking about that last night what I was praying and I was just thinking about this uh you know uh uh the scripture says this promise is unto you into your children it did not say it's unto you so you can give it to your children no no no no it's unto you and to your children you can pass it down to them but the promise is for them they have to be prepared to receive it just like you receive it it's not something that we can hand down no so we have a responsibility to create all the atmosphere around them for them to be attracted to the promise right yes in any way that we can support them praise the Lord believe the Lord Jesus in your household will be safe in the climax of his message he said it was the responsibility that Jonah was running away from a man running away from the presence of the Lord he was running away from the responsibility of bringing a a Jewish message to a gentile people praise the Lord the responsibility of bringing a Jewish god to a gentile hidden people everybody knew that Nineveh was a wicked City everybody knew that the wickedness and the evil that was done in that City but God needed a voice to cry out brother Branham says the responsibility of the hour is to cry out it's a crowd against the wrong crowd against sin praise the Lord we want to you know rub one another on the back be nice to one another you know and and just going out like they I know it does not work that way it does not work that way amen very powerful guy Eddie he says and the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message and as I get older and I know my days is short enough I feel the responsibility greater than I've ever felt it passing on I must do it we must get down in in every word we go and tell the message and tell the people that Jesus Christ is coming that that he's God and he's coming soon there's not a hope left in this word but the coming of the Lord praise the Lord amen now you can see it it it it it happens to you if you're not like that you are the one coming to preach on Sunday all you are the one playing the music or even or even singing a special but they were just an audience said I guess on your own I gotta hurry up and get a church oh yeah getting late why you do that why you do that when you are not the one that is opening the door you are not the one that got to set people down but why do you do that it's because a spirit of responsibility is on your shoulder praise the Lord that's why you look at your time ah my goodness it's late even you are working and and and then you realize you you have to do this you know you this is your time that you have you you sign up to work till this time but you keep looking at your time yeah I want to clock out now and go why you do that is because the spirit of his stewardship God bought stewardship on you you feel it that I need to be in church I need to get to church praise the Lord and like Paul says every man that is asked to be a steward must be faithful there is one requirement of every Steward that we must be faithful to what God has placed in our hands to what he have taught us to do you see that's the reason why the things that will bring our reward not the things that we do to please people praise the Lord is because God has given you a responsibility to be a Son of God in this age to believe that you are a son of God and to live like one to be proud that you are a son of God just like if they call you and says you are the manager of this place you write a note of thanks church I want to thank the Lord the Lord has blessed me and the law was gracious to me I work and by the grace of God they gave me now a position to be the manager you feel that sense of responsibility praise the Lord and let me tell you pretty soon is going to affect the way you you dress to work is going to affect the way you do things at work because now you are a manager but all along you being the manager people you're being a manager Christ has given you that position Christ in you the hope of glory to manage his life his love to a dying word praise the Lord amen you are a manager they just promote you you think you have the attitude to go to work when you want to go to work I'm a manager I bet I don't feel like going to work today and I'm the manager praise the Lord and you can just throw things off and you know and just care less about things you want to behave like a manager when when the CEO come around you have to be a manager at all times praise the Lord and brother Brown who talks about that slave in the auction his father was a king even though he was in Shadows but he behaved like the son of a king he might have had his legs chained but he behave it was not his dress called it was something in him that told him even though you are bound in Chains you are a son of the king boy behave like one and that's the same thing when the spirit of God the Holy Ghost come on the life of the believer he might be going through a trial you don't handle your hand your heads down and just whine and look for who to blame no you are a son of the king your father have Ten Thousand Candles on the hill you have the whole world in his hands inheritance is bigger than your problem praise the Lord your inheritance is bigger than your problem soul is just just to remind you want to go back and play that tip again just watch out for those things that brought Brandon strike on on responsibility because he had a responsibility to bring a word people it's it's courage it takes courage for a man of seven Great education to come and stand have a public life to say God had just given me the message of marriage and divorce praise the Lord and that's some of the things I wanted to share with you tonight just to be able to cap up on on the message you know as we as we go through the series I'll try to to do that in the in the middle or the end of every every message we play and uh we continue on our our tape playing in the preparation of the service on Sunday you can play the message at home come to service and and listen to the tape you know drive on your way listening to the tape you got to put yourself in the word praise the Lord you have put yourself in a word for the things who come real to you sorry musicians you can come up as we go to the Lord in prayer let's just think about it each and every one of us it is not just coming through these doors on a Wednesday night or on a Sunday morning let's realize that we have the life of the people in this community on our hands we have the life of the people of the City of Minneapolis on our hands praise the Lord if we start to realize and each and every one of us [Music] start to take our responsibilities serious praise the Lord amen we start to take our responsibility serious and realize that we are responsible the deacons will not have to beg us to do certain things you feel that you are responsible there are things on your hands you want to do something you want to tell somebody about Jesus you have this responsibility it's on your hands but we just read it just now each every one of us a messenger of this message if you get that feeling in your heart you want to let the best the best life the best Christ's life you want to take the courage to talk to a friend and encourage them or just give them an invitation you don't have to force them I like I'd like you to come come and come and worship with us you got to do something about your responsibility you have responsibility and you can't do anything you know the reason why we we we we we get we get careless on responsibility is because we don't learn to take initiatives when you learn to take initiative when you have a responsibility you behave well because you are already doing it if you wait to be told to do this you wait to be told to do that it's just like you're living in a house you're in a house you you should have an initiative find something to do clean the table clean the window look around and see if there are spiders on the on the ceiling everything that was called John come and do this Joseph come and do this you will never rise to a life of responsibility if you don't learn to take little initiatives [Music] and you want you want great position [Music] pick the broom and sweep

know that you can sell somebody you can sell them just in the street when you say God bless you you can just sell them without blessing sometimes the place where we get confused is that when you sell people like you go to a tour to a dinner it's not everything that serves you that you take so it's not everything that you sell people they will take sometimes they will refuse it but that should not make you to take on your apron and get that on the ground and walk away sometimes you are kind to people you are nice to them they will spit right in your face and then and they said nasty thing about
