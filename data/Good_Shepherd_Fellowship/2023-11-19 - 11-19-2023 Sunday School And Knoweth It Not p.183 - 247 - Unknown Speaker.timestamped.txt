[3:23] yourself what did he do from is working
[3:26] from the outside now to this first man
[3:29] so now look you
[3:32] know when you was a few years ago about
[3:35] two three years ago before you accepted
[3:37] this you was well thought of amongst the
[3:39] people you lived a good clean life any
[3:42] girl in this city want to go out go out
[3:44] with you because it felt clean and

[3:47] them I never insulted one never said
[3:50] anything she even acts smart I take her
[3:53] home and you were liked amongst the
[3:55] people but what are you now a religious
[3:58] fanatic that's
[4:00] right I was see these things begin to
[4:03] move together the outside reasoning of

[6:19] very best friends has walked away from
[6:21] you as a religious fanatic everything he
[6:24] was telling me was the
[6:26] truth everything that he would say just
[6:29] all right in line see
[6:31] here I'm just then about ready to say
[6:35] then that's the way he has to act then I
[6:38] won't serve you just as said that there
[6:41] was something come from somewhere
[6:43] else way down on the inside said who are
[6:46] you to begin with the lord gave and the
[6:50] Lord taken away see that's that Inside
[6:53] Man don't reason it all I look back and
[6:57] I thought how do I get on Earth
[7:00] I come from a bunch of
[7:02] drunkards how did I get here who give me
[7:06] life who give me that wife who give me
[7:08] that
[7:09] baby where did my wife come from where
[7:12] did my life come from I said do you slay
[7:15] me yet I'll trust him I said get wave me
[7:18] Satan I laid my hand over on the baby I
[7:20] said Shar honey I'll lay you on your
[7:22] mother's arms in a few minutes when the
[7:23] angels of God comes to take you away but
[7:26] one day daddy will see you again I don't
[7:28] know how going to be honey I can't tell
[7:30] you how when he turns his back up on me
[7:33] he won't even hear for you he let my
[7:34] wife gu me holding her by the hands
[7:36] crying for her and my daddy and his arms
[7:39] died on this arm right here looking up
[7:40] at me trying to get his breath and I
[7:43] praying as hard as I could how could I
[7:44] face the public again to preach Divine
[7:47] Healing how could I preach it was a good
[7:48] God to let my own daddy die sinner how
[7:51] could I preach it I don't know
[7:54] how I know he's right the word of God
[7:58] shall never fail it or try it no matter
[8:00] what that is then I know there was
[8:02] something inside of all reasonings
[8:04] something inside of all emotions
[8:07] everything else like that there was an
[8:08] inside
[8:10] man that help in that hour nothing else
[8:13] could have done ever reason ever think
[8:15] it be showed everything of pro that it
[8:17] was wrong and I was in the wrong but the
[8:19] word of God that was predestinated
[8:21] before the foundation of the world held
[8:23] on the
[8:25] inside I felt a little wind come through
[8:28] the building Spirit went to beat
[8:31] god brother sister let me tell you
[8:34] that's the only
[8:35] thing don't try to reason out don't try
[8:39] to have long hair because I said so
[8:41] don't try to do these things just
[8:43] because in your flesh don't try to do it
[8:46] just kind of cope up but just wait
[8:48] before the Lord though something we
[8:51] there on the
[8:55] inside many of you think cause you to
[8:57] got long hair that means you're going to
[8:59] go go to heaven that doesn't mean that
[9:01] many of them thinks because you're a
[9:02] good moral woman you go to I don't mean
[9:04] that many of them think because there
[9:06] churches and belong to this and this
[9:07] great groups and great doctors of
[9:09] divinity that don't mean that see many
[9:12] think because they speak with tongues
[9:13] they've got the holy ghost that don't
[9:15] mean that though the Holy Ghost does
[9:16] speak with tongues but until that real
[9:19] genuine Holy Spirit in there will cope
[9:21] with every word if that Holy Spirit in
[9:24] you it makes you speak with tongues
[9:25] looks back and doesn't agree with the
[9:27] rest of the word then it's a Rong
[9:30] it's got to come from the inside which
[9:33] is the word from the beginning in the
[9:35] beginning of the creation of God when
[9:37] God be to create bring you into
[9:40] existence you see you started back there
[9:41] as a seed and worked down to where you
[9:43] are now and then you were all in Christ
[9:46] then when Christ died he died to redeem
[9:48] all of you and you are part of this
[9:53] world and how can if the Bible all of it
[9:57] precept upon precept line upon line here
[10:00] a little there a little not one shot or
[10:02] TT shall fail how in the world can you
[10:05] be part of that word disagree with the
[10:07] rest of it or any part of
[10:11] it God bless you I've over time now I
[10:16] didn't mean to do is keep you that
[10:18] long
[10:20] sorry I kept you not sorry for what I
[10:25] say we're right at the end of something
