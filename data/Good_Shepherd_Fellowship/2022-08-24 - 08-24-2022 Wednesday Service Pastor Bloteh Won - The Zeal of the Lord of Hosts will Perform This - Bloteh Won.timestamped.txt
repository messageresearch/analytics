[15:44] [Music]
[16:07] over

[16:12] [Music]
[16:20] world um
[16:25] [Music]
[16:44] is
[16:46] [Music]
[17:02] jesus
[17:05] [Music]
[17:21] let's sing that last verse again
[17:32] too
[17:49] is
[18:06] and he will
[18:11] [Music]
[18:28] yes
[18:30] [Music]
[18:59] i
[19:00] must tell jesus
[19:04] [Music]
[19:11] jesus
[19:14] jesus
[19:16] can't have
[19:20] me
[19:22] [Music]
[19:33] i want to read a quote here from brother
[19:35] branham just before we go into prayer
[19:39] from the message he cares do you hear
[19:42] [Music]
[19:44] and just singing this verse just just
[19:47] kind of
[19:48] writing that quote on my mind or how the
[19:51] word
[19:54] evil
[19:56] you know is
[19:58] pressing upon us but brother branham
[20:00] said this
[20:01] and he said we found out
[20:05] that many people try to find comfort
[20:09] by drinking
[20:11] now don't look at drinking
[20:13] just look at many people try to find
[20:15] comfort
[20:16] because some find it by drinking and
[20:18] some find comfort by different things
[20:21] he says you know
[20:24] we have a saying which is pretty well
[20:27] known
[20:28] among us today
[20:29] that many ministers drink sometimes
[20:31] before they come to the pulpit
[20:34] they take a heavy
[20:36] drink
[20:37] of intoxication it's been known
[20:41] to see ministers on the platform
[20:44] that even struggle under the influence
[20:46] of aquifer
[20:48] that ought not to be so
[20:51] it should not be
[20:53] it's because many times
[20:57] we might condemn the man now listen to
[21:00] this now
[21:01] many times we might condemn the man or
[21:04] condemn the person
[21:06] when maybe
[21:07] we ought not to do that that's right we
[21:11] ought to find back
[21:14] what's the trouble
[21:16] what is making the person to find
[21:18] comfort
[21:20] in whatever they are finding comfort in
[21:22] yes
[21:23] praise the lord
[21:25] now listening that brother branham
[21:26] continued
[21:28] he said
[21:34] [Music]
[21:37] he said
[21:39] we ought to find back what's the trouble
[21:42] he said many of them was converted
[21:46] from alcohol
[21:48] and we find out
[21:50] if they
[21:51] if they are in that condition
[21:54] it's a disgrace and a reproach
[21:57] now so brother branham is condemning it
[21:59] if the person is doing that it's a
[22:01] disgrace and it's a reproach
[22:04] but yet the problem is that god brought
[22:07] the person out of it
[22:09] sometimes
[22:10] uh it is uh uh things that wrongs in the
[22:14] family
[22:15] of the person
[22:16] praise the lord
[22:18] even though the law brought them out of
[22:20] it but you have to know that the uh uh
[22:25] they are
[22:26] the uh
[22:27] their flesh they are formally strained
[22:30] sometimes
[22:32] pulled on them sometimes detects to them
[22:36] now so let's let's read down a little
[22:37] bit he says
[22:40] it's a disgrace and a reproach
[22:42] but no more a reproach
[22:45] than it would be
[22:47] to lie
[22:48] or to steal
[22:50] to lust after woman
[22:53] women
[22:54] or any other things
[22:57] that's
[22:58] in the commandment
[23:00] anything that is against the word
[23:03] [Music]
[23:05] and maybe a man
[23:08] born high passion
[23:12] he's talking about lustful desire and he
[23:14] sees these
[23:16] modern striptease on the street and he's
[23:19] constantly in
[23:20] trouble
[23:22] he says the man is born that way
[23:27] that's the condition of his natural
[23:29] birth
[23:31] praise the lord
[23:33] now
[23:34] when
[23:34] when he ought to do
[23:36] the minister that drinks or the man or
[23:39] the woman that smokes or dressed immoral
[23:41] trying to draw her comfort
[23:45] from being so well
[23:48] put together
[23:50] that she wants to cause
[23:53] uh a man to look at her
[23:56] now so brother branham goes on and and
[23:58] he goes on as he talks to but
[24:01] if you just stay right in that place
[24:05] of
[24:06] where our comfort is
[24:10] where
[24:11] where our
[24:12] [Music]
[24:16] comfort and you and we know that the
[24:19] holy ghost is promised
[24:21] jesus said he will be our comforter
[24:24] [Music]
[24:28] because uh
[24:33] god will not promise us
[24:36] another comforter
[24:40] only because he knows that
[24:44] in the sinful nature that we are born on
[24:47] earth
[24:48] there are many strains in our family
[24:51] that will bring us comfort
[24:55] that will bring us comfort
[24:57] [Music]
[25:00] listened to brother branham saying this
[25:03] and i was i was just
[25:05] i was just uh
[25:07] listening to something the other day
[25:08] molding the lawn
[25:10] and working at in the back of the house
[25:12] and
[25:13] and and i start to realize that uh
[25:17] right from
[25:18] our womb from from the warm when the
[25:21] child is conceived in the warm
[25:25] we stops to adopt different comfort
[25:30] right from the womb
[25:32] [Music]
[25:35] we start to
[25:38] adopt different comfort science proof
[25:40] that when a child is in a womb and
[25:44] and
[25:44] [Music]
[25:46] the mother or the parents is always
[25:48] playing godly music the child will get
[25:51] comfort from that
[25:53] and they are certain things that uh if
[25:56] the child is born in the home where
[25:58] there are us always fascists and strive
[26:00] and all of that
[26:02] it will the child were born uh with a
[26:05] lot of discomfort
[26:07] and and different things so i started to
[26:09] think on this
[26:11] and just before we prayed tonight just
[26:13] before we prayed tonight
[26:15] [Music]
[26:19] and i
[26:20] would just want us to take it
[26:22] too hard and take it as
[26:24] as a prayer burden as we approach the
[26:26] law tonight
[26:28] that
[26:31] we can we can search our own
[26:34] heart and just look down our life there
[26:36] are different things that have brought
[26:37] us comfort
[26:38] you know uh and as brother branham is
[26:41] saying this he says
[26:43] you know sometimes we we we get too fast
[26:45] to judge the person or too fast to
[26:47] condemn ourself it's just for us to
[26:50] realize that all of these all of these
[26:52] different things that that you know that
[26:55] detects uh to us
[26:57] in bringing comfort and drive us in the
[27:00] play in in uh you know in in the
[27:03] different strains of life that we are
[27:05] drawn in
[27:06] you notice is is all of those things
[27:08] that comes from our first birth yeah all
[27:11] of those things that comes from our
[27:13] natural birth
[27:15] but with god promising us himself
[27:19] he's promising us himself
[27:22] as
[27:23] our comforter
[27:25] meaning that we can get
[27:28] a superseding comfort in him
[27:32] in spending time with his word and
[27:34] spending time in prayer
[27:37] and uh
[27:39] and just identifying
[27:41] that he can bring us enough comfort
[27:45] than anything
[27:47] that
[27:49] that we can get comfort from
[27:52] whatever
[27:53] this flesh would give to us as a comfort
[27:55] would just be a pacifier
[27:58] it would never satisfy
[28:01] it would come for us for a while and we
[28:03] would get out of it and we would go back
[28:04] to it again
[28:06] it would never satisfy
[28:08] but when he the comforter comes
[28:11] if we can identify him as the comforter
[28:15] as the comfort they are satisfied
[28:18] when we are trouble
[28:19] when we are restless when we are
[28:21] burdened
[28:22] we will run to him
[28:24] because he is the only one that can
[28:26] satisfy
[28:33] praise the lord
[28:35] so as we just buy our house tonight and
[28:37] go to the lord in prayer
[28:41] i want us to approach him tonight and as
[28:44] we identify in our heart as our
[28:46] comforter
[28:48] as the only one that can satisfy
[28:51] [Music]
[28:54] and that's why we come to him tonight
[28:57] no matter what we're struggling with in
[28:59] our mind
[29:01] no matter what the enemy is trying to
[29:03] detect to us
[29:06] and he brings those things to weaken us
[29:09] to condemn us
[29:14] but you have to remember
[29:17] that jesus said i will give you another
[29:19] comforter
[29:23] i will give you another comforter and we
[29:26] can get comfort
[29:28] he's a loving god that cares for us
[29:32] he don't want us to be restless he don't
[29:34] want us to be troubled
[29:40] he don't want us to be discomfort
[29:46] he want us to come to the house of god
[29:49] and realize that
[29:51] we can get comfort in his presence
[29:57] we can come
[30:00] we can bring our hearts we can bring our
[30:02] burden to him
[30:15] so whatever it is tonight i just want us
[30:17] to
[30:19] just go to the lord in prayer
[30:26] maybe it's a habit maybe it's
[30:29] it's a family strain maybe whatever it
[30:31] is
[30:33] that we
[30:40] fake comforting
[30:43] most especially most especially
[30:45] the ones sometimes
[30:49] there seems to be
[30:51] a sense of comfort but yet it brings a
[30:53] lot of condemnation to our hearts
[30:57] let's take it to the great comforter
[30:58] tonight
[31:00] i believe the lord can replace it
[31:02] i believe he can give us a satisfying
[31:05] potion
[31:06] i believe he can give us himself
[31:09] that we can get strength
[31:26] let's speak to him tonight
[31:29] heavenly father

[1:00:42] let me just send an email to the church
[1:00:44] please remind me
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:50] last wednesday i was speaking i was
[1:00:52] speaking on something and i think i got
[1:00:54] my picture mixed up so i thought that i
[1:00:57] should correct that in the books because
[1:01:06] as chapter 16 before we get to what we
[1:01:08] want to speak tonight let's let's just
[1:01:10] turn to acts chapter 16 let me just
[1:01:13] correct that
[1:01:14] and uh and then we will get into what we
[1:01:17] want to talk tonight uh
[1:01:19] brother stephen ajard is flying from
[1:01:20] virginia he will be here tonight so i'll
[1:01:23] leave from service to pick him up from
[1:01:25] the from the airport
[1:01:26] uh he will uh he will be visiting with
[1:01:29] us
[1:01:30] uh we we we had a need to go down in and
[1:01:34] uh and help a family did in
[1:01:37] missouri
[1:01:38] so
[1:01:40] he's a trusted friend so i'm going to
[1:01:42] send him to help me do that one
[1:01:45] praise the lord
[1:01:47] and then
[1:01:48] tomorrow
[1:01:50] brother valentine
[1:01:52] will be flying in also
[1:01:54] in the evening and he will stay and be
[1:01:57] with us on the weekend
[1:01:58] brothers brother jarrod will be back
[1:02:00] next week and then
[1:02:02] we will give him opportunity to testify
[1:02:05] to us praise the lord
[1:02:08] amen
[1:02:09] now as chapter 16
[1:02:13] then came he to their body and lestrade
[1:02:16] and behold a setting disciple
[1:02:18] was there named timmeters the son of a
[1:02:22] certain woman
[1:02:23] which was
[1:02:25] uh jewish and and believed
[1:02:28] but his father was greek
[1:02:31] so timothy was a gentile
[1:02:36] timity was a gentile
[1:02:41] which was well reported of the brethren
[1:02:45] or were reported of by the brethrens
[1:02:48] that were at least tried in a coldness
[1:02:52] him who paul have to go forth with him
[1:02:57] and
[1:02:58] and talk and circumcise him
[1:03:00] because of the jews now in last
[1:03:03] wednesday i said titles
[1:03:06] i kind of misplaced that i said titus
[1:03:10] so that's that's what i wanted to
[1:03:11] correct tonight it was timidity not
[1:03:13] titus
[1:03:15] so paul
[1:03:16] uh poor half uh uh for some reason right
[1:03:19] after the service that i mean the lord
[1:03:21] just picked me on it i was driving home
[1:03:23] as i was thinking i said i didn't get
[1:03:26] this thing right so i kind of for such a
[1:03:28] before i went to bed or as i would have
[1:03:30] a bad dream
[1:03:34] i want to make sure that i sleep well
[1:03:38] when god is getting after you you better
[1:03:40] make sure you do what he wants you to do
[1:03:42] as you get a bad dream let me warn you
[1:03:44] now i'm telling you personal experience
[1:03:52] so him will paul have to go forth with
[1:03:54] him
[1:03:55] and talk and
[1:03:57] uh and took him and circumcised him
[1:03:58] because of of the jews which were
[1:04:02] in those quarters for they knew all
[1:04:06] that his father was a greek
[1:04:10] why would paul do that and paul will be
[1:04:13] the same one that will be blasting that
[1:04:15] the jews now to force the gentile to be
[1:04:18] circumcised but why would paul do that
[1:04:21] because timothy will become a pastor of
[1:04:23] a jewish church
[1:04:31] trinity will become the pastor of a
[1:04:33] jewish church
[1:04:37] there are things
[1:04:38] that uh
[1:04:42] we
[1:04:43] learned that god's ways are past falling
[1:04:46] out
[1:04:48] you can put god
[1:04:50] don't trust your brain
[1:04:51] to understand god
[1:04:56] don't trust your brain to understand god
[1:05:00] you got to trust your heart
[1:05:06] so
[1:05:07] so that was what i got wrong and that's
[1:05:09] why i wanted to make sure that i got to
[1:05:11] get that clad on the box
[1:05:14] praise the lord
[1:05:16] and now there are some other few things
[1:05:18] i could say about that but i'm already
[1:05:21] into the time almost 8 30 years so i
[1:05:23] have in 30 minutes to preach to you
[1:05:25] tonight
[1:05:26] and uh and unless you want me to preach
[1:05:29] longer then you can lead me till 10
[1:05:31] o'clock
[1:05:34] praise the lord but something caught my
[1:05:37] attention today
[1:05:39] i was uh
[1:05:42] i was just thanking the lord for
[1:05:43] something in and praying
[1:05:46] and
[1:05:47] uh
[1:05:49] and the holy spirit brought something to
[1:05:51] my mind i preached this message long
[1:05:53] time ago
[1:05:54] a long time ago i remember that uh
[1:05:57] one time i preached on the refugee camp
[1:05:59] in ghana
[1:06:01] but uh uh
[1:06:05] i want to speak tonight on the zoo of
[1:06:07] the lord
[1:06:09] of hosts we perform this
[1:06:12] the zeus of the lord of hosts will
[1:06:15] perform this
[1:06:16] now so we see here we we know that uh uh
[1:06:20] this whole thing uh is from god asking
[1:06:23] the king to ask for a sign
[1:06:26] on a which he said a virgin shall
[1:06:27] conceive
[1:06:29] so in connection with isaiah chapter 7
[1:06:35] in expansion of that prophecy
[1:06:38] we see here that
[1:06:42] the coming of the messiah the coming
[1:06:45] of
[1:06:46] the christ child
[1:06:48] the coming
[1:06:50] of
[1:06:51] god in flesh
[1:06:53] i want you to get the picture before i
[1:06:55] get into all of my drama
[1:07:01] this is god promising
[1:07:04] his desire
[1:07:06] when he said to the serpent the seed of
[1:07:08] the woman will bruise the head of the
[1:07:10] serpent
[1:07:11] god watch over their promise and he was
[1:07:14] you know he was working all through
[1:07:16] the ages but here he said that it's
[1:07:18] coming into plainview
[1:07:21] now the picture that i want you to get
[1:07:23] here
[1:07:24] god
[1:07:25] becoming flesh
[1:07:28] god becoming flesh
[1:07:30] the promise
[1:07:31] that the virgin shall conceive
[1:07:34] and unto us a child
[1:07:36] is born unto us a son is giving
[1:07:39] that promise
[1:07:41] that is going to come to mankind
[1:07:46] is going to be brought to us
[1:07:49] by only one means
[1:07:52] yes
[1:07:53] the zeal of the lord will perform this
[1:07:59] it's going to be god's zeal
[1:08:02] that will bring it to pass
[1:08:04] god will be so zealous
[1:08:08] he will be so serious
[1:08:12] that he would get a hold of a man
[1:08:16] joseph
[1:08:17] and prepare him
[1:08:19] with all his life experience
[1:08:23] to be able to watch over a young woman
[1:08:27] the zeal of the lord
[1:08:30] will perform this
[1:08:33] and if god
[1:08:37] if the word make flesh if the word made
[1:08:40] flesh or the word becoming flesh the
[1:08:43] first time
[1:08:44] the zeal of the law performed
[1:08:47] it would take the zeal of the lord
[1:08:49] to bring the word in your flesh
[1:08:52] it won't take your works
[1:08:55] it won't take your religious exercise
[1:08:58] the zeal of the lord
[1:09:00] will have to perform this
[1:09:02] if god said i will have a bride that
[1:09:04] would be a rapture it would take the
[1:09:07] view of the lord
[1:09:09] to do it
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:13] praise the lord
[1:09:19] so we have to we have to be
[1:09:21] we have to be careful
[1:09:24] we have to examine our zeal
[1:09:26] i want to talk a little bit about zeal
[1:09:28] tonight
[1:09:30] because we're living in an age where
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:35] it's a zealous age there are a lot of
[1:09:37] people rioting and a lot of things going
[1:09:39] on
[1:09:42] when we look in the in the laodicea
[1:09:44] church age
[1:09:46] we found that we find that same word
[1:09:49] promised to this age
[1:09:52] verse 19 of chapter three as many as i
[1:09:55] love
[1:09:57] god's love to this age
[1:09:59] i rebuke
[1:10:01] and trusting
[1:10:03] be zealious therefore
[1:10:06] and repent
[1:10:08] praise the lord
[1:10:10] be zealious therefore i believe that the
[1:10:13] zeal of the lord is also expressed to
[1:10:15] our age because this is the age
[1:10:18] because the the beginning of this age
[1:10:21] we know that the introduction when
[1:10:24] christ introduced himself to this age he
[1:10:27] introduced himself as the beginning of
[1:10:29] the creation of god
[1:10:31] so there is another creation
[1:10:35] another creation
[1:10:38] that is going to be formed in this age
[1:10:40] and it will take the zeal of the law to
[1:10:42] bring it to pass
[1:10:44] just like the creation
[1:10:47] of almighty god in
[1:10:49] the womb of mary
[1:10:51] it took the zeal of the lord
[1:10:54] to perform it
[1:10:58] praise the lord
[1:11:00] are we together
[1:11:02] brother branham said this when he
[1:11:05] he dealt with that in the church age
[1:11:10] uh
[1:11:15] revelation 3 19 i'm reading from
[1:11:18] the exposition of the church asia
[1:11:24] as many as i love
[1:11:27] i rebuke
[1:11:28] and trust him resilience
[1:11:31] therefore and repaint
[1:11:35] he says
[1:11:37] be zealious and repent
[1:11:40] now this false church
[1:11:42] has zeal
[1:11:46] make no mistake about her
[1:11:48] no make no mistake about that
[1:11:51] joseo
[1:11:53] has literally been
[1:11:56] that of the jews
[1:12:00] saint john
[1:12:02] 2 17.
[1:12:03] if you can just
[1:12:05] try to
[1:12:06] copy your mind what it was
[1:12:10] let's go to st john 2 17 and
[1:12:13] read that
[1:12:32] i was praying in there
[1:12:34] and
[1:12:35] you know i was i was just placing some
[1:12:37] things in the hands of the lord and and
[1:12:40] to me it just felt like the lord
[1:12:41] answered me back and said the zeal of
[1:12:43] the lord would perform it
[1:12:45] so he blessed my heart and i was
[1:12:47] meditating upon it
[1:12:49] and then i went back and started looking
[1:12:50] at some things so we see here
[1:12:54] that brother bran
[1:12:55] mentioned here the disciples
[1:12:58] in john chapter 2 and his disciples
[1:13:01] remember that it is written the zeal of
[1:13:04] the
[1:13:05] house has eaten me up you know what the
[1:13:07] story is jesus enter into the the temple
[1:13:11] whipping the people out of the temple
[1:13:14] and and and the bible says right there
[1:13:17] the holy ghost
[1:13:18] brought that scripture to the minds of
[1:13:20] the disciple
[1:13:22] they are looking at the act jesus
[1:13:24] whipping these people out
[1:13:25] and the holy ghost brought what david
[1:13:28] said in the psalm
[1:13:30] that
[1:13:31] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:35] that's right
[1:13:36] praise the lord
[1:13:38] amen
[1:13:40] now so
[1:13:41] so brother branham says here not that
[1:13:43] you have to realize that the false
[1:13:45] church has zeal make no mistake about
[1:13:47] her ozil
[1:13:49] has literally been that of the jews
[1:13:52] and what was he referring to they were
[1:13:54] very zealous
[1:13:56] thinking that they are keeping the
[1:13:58] commandments of the law they have now
[1:14:00] turned the house of god to the dance of
[1:14:02] thieves
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:06] being very zealous trying to achieve and
[1:14:09] raise money for the church and different
[1:14:11] things that they are trying to do
[1:14:14] they were doing it in a religious i mean
[1:14:17] they found lord of reasons to back that
[1:14:20] up
[1:14:24] praise the lord so brother branham is
[1:14:26] now comparing that is he's identifying
[1:14:29] that kind of action
[1:14:32] where people will find reason to do
[1:14:35] certain things very reasonable
[1:14:40] and they will get the energy behind it
[1:14:45] they will find all the scriptures in the
[1:14:47] code to back what they are doing
[1:14:51] but it's a false zeal
[1:14:58] the zero of the the zero of the house
[1:15:00] has eaten me up
[1:15:03] he says but it is a wrong zeal not the
[1:15:06] zeal of the house but the zeal of those
[1:15:09] jews
[1:15:12] that's what he's referring to
[1:15:14] because he's comparing their zeal
[1:15:16] because you have to realize that jesus
[1:15:19] was the word of the hour
[1:15:23] amen
[1:15:24] he was the word he was the promise of
[1:15:27] the hour
[1:15:31] now what what is what what is the thing
[1:15:35] easier for those guys to do is to go
[1:15:37] right to the word of the hour and say
[1:15:40] jesus what should we do
[1:15:42] no they they have their sahendra's
[1:15:45] counsel they have their their their
[1:15:47] clegic and they decided they agreed upon
[1:15:50] it they voted upon it and out of there
[1:15:52] and he decided to do it
[1:15:54] so he says but it was a wrong seal
[1:15:57] it is for the house of their own
[1:16:00] building
[1:16:02] not the house of the lord
[1:16:05] but the house for their own building
[1:16:10] it is for their own creeds and and
[1:16:13] dogmas and organization
[1:16:15] their own righteousness
[1:16:18] does that sound does that make sound to
[1:16:20] you their own righteousness paul dealt
[1:16:23] with that in romans chapter nine
[1:16:25] he says the jews were zealious
[1:16:31] in their righteousness they were
[1:16:33] zealious and they crucified the very
[1:16:36] word
[1:16:37] they crucified the very christ in their
[1:16:39] own zeal
[1:16:44] paul says oh how my heart believed for
[1:16:46] my brethren
[1:16:48] they have zeal but without knowledge
[1:16:58] amen
[1:16:59] they have zeal they want to do things
[1:17:01] for god
[1:17:03] but without knowledge
[1:17:09] so he says here
[1:17:12] for it is their own creed and document
[1:17:14] and organization their own righteousness
[1:17:18] they have put the word out
[1:17:22] for their own idea
[1:17:26] praise the lord
[1:17:28] they have put the word out they have
[1:17:29] laid the word down and and and and
[1:17:32] they're able to convince this person to
[1:17:34] convince this person and you know and
[1:17:36] all of that
[1:17:38] and and it brings
[1:17:40] it brings them a strength
[1:17:42] they are in tools
[1:17:44] amen
[1:17:48] they have a passion
[1:17:49] they have a burden
[1:17:54] but they have put the word
[1:17:57] out for their own idea
[1:17:59] that
[1:18:01] they disposed the holy ghost
[1:18:04] and made men
[1:18:06] into leaders
[1:18:09] they have put aside internal life
[1:18:13] as a
[1:18:15] person
[1:18:16] and make internal life an idea
[1:18:21] and make internal life a feeling
[1:18:25] they have put away internal life as a
[1:18:28] person
[1:18:31] praise the lord
[1:18:38] they have put aside internal life as a
[1:18:40] person
[1:18:42] and make
[1:18:44] it good works
[1:18:48] or even
[1:18:50] church conformity
[1:18:53] rather than
[1:18:57] good works
[1:18:59] but god is calling
[1:19:02] for another zeal
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:07] god is calling
[1:19:10] for another zeal
[1:19:18] it is the zeal to cry
[1:19:21] i
[1:19:22] am wrong
[1:19:25] now you have to see the contracts here
[1:19:27] because this is laodicea age the age of
[1:19:32] the people's right
[1:19:35] and who's going to step back
[1:19:38] from the spirit of the age and say god
[1:19:40] i'm wrong i need help
[1:19:46] who's going to step back
[1:19:49] from the spirit of the age
[1:19:53] and say god i'm wrong
[1:19:58] that's the view of the hour
[1:20:01] be zealous and repent how will you
[1:20:04] repent if you don't realize that you are
[1:20:06] wrong
[1:20:08] how will you ever repent if you don't
[1:20:10] identify
[1:20:11] an area where you need to repent
[1:20:21] praise the lord so you see the blessings
[1:20:23] that have come to the bride
[1:20:26] because it's the zeal of the lord
[1:20:29] that is bringing us to constant
[1:20:31] repentance
[1:20:35] it's because god has predestinated us to
[1:20:38] be a bride
[1:20:40] and whatever it takes him
[1:20:43] to bring us on our knees he's going to
[1:20:46] do it
[1:20:48] whether you like it or not
[1:20:51] he has a different way
[1:20:53] of making you comfortable
[1:20:57] join the bathroom ministry comfort you
[1:20:59] comfort you my people
[1:21:00] and he come there and blasting other
[1:21:02] people what can i for comfort is that
[1:21:07] sure
[1:21:08] what kind of a comforter i thought this
[1:21:10] man supposed to be petting the people on
[1:21:12] their back
[1:21:16] going to their house and doing their
[1:21:18] groceries
[1:21:21] praise the lord
[1:21:22] oh that's the kind of comforter that we
[1:21:24] like somebody to do all the work for us
[1:21:32] but he was a different comforter
[1:21:36] he said it's not lawful for you to have
[1:21:37] your brother's wife
[1:21:43] god has a different way
[1:21:46] of bringing comfort
[1:21:50] no matter what comfort we get from this
[1:21:52] world is just a pacifier
[1:21:57] it's just a pacifier
[1:22:00] go through the night the next morning
[1:22:01] you wake up all your troubles are on the
[1:22:03] table
[1:22:08] praise the lord i put on the table five
[1:22:11] brother you're right it's right beside
[1:22:13] the bed
[1:22:20] brother branham said
[1:22:22] but god is calling for another zeal
[1:22:26] it is the zeal to cry i am wrong
[1:22:30] now who is going to say that he is wrong
[1:22:38] who is going to say
[1:22:40] the spirit of this age is to justify
[1:22:42] yourself in whatever you are doing
[1:22:49] that's what make the age an age that is
[1:22:51] defined
[1:22:56] is the age of people's right
[1:22:59] who is going to say
[1:23:01] i'm wrong
[1:23:08] praise the lord
[1:23:12] water said that all these denominations
[1:23:14] are basing on
[1:23:19] they have their claims of original
[1:23:22] church they can trace where they came
[1:23:23] from
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:27] every one of them
[1:23:29] and how god worked mightily in their day
[1:23:33] they claim that they are right
[1:23:36] as long as they can trace their church
[1:23:38] back to john wesley and they can trace
[1:23:40] their church back to luther and they can
[1:23:42] trace their church back to azusa street
[1:23:49] praise the lord
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:52] and we can trace our church back to
[1:23:54] jeffersonville and brother branham
[1:24:01] as long as we can we can keep ourselves
[1:24:03] in that comfort
[1:24:08] praise the lord
[1:24:13] are we together
[1:24:15] but you see that uh like the prophet
[1:24:17] said god is calling
[1:24:19] for a different kind of physio
[1:24:22] because this is the zeal of the lord
[1:24:26] is the zeal of the lord
[1:24:29] that will perform this
[1:24:31] amen
[1:24:36] and you just think about it tonight i
[1:24:38] mean this is a prayer meeting i don't
[1:24:40] want to make this a revival service just
[1:24:42] think about it tonight
[1:24:45] just think about it
[1:24:48] god is the one that make this promise
[1:24:52] amen
[1:24:53] and he's going to see to it
[1:24:58] he's going to see to it
[1:25:02] that this child is born
[1:25:05] now if you if you go back to verse 5
[1:25:08] that was the reason why the holy spirit
[1:25:10] honored the prophet said
[1:25:12] every battle
[1:25:15] is with a confused noise
[1:25:17] he said but this one going to be
[1:25:19] different
[1:25:20] sure because the one that is in charge
[1:25:22] of this battle
[1:25:24] is not going to fight it in confusion
[1:25:28] he's determined from the foundation of
[1:25:30] the word
[1:25:31] his mind is made up he has a blueprint
[1:25:34] that is already written
[1:25:36] he's not going around recruiting who who
[1:25:38] i can get on my team he have already
[1:25:41] predestinated man
[1:25:43] he had predestinated a people for this
[1:25:45] age
[1:25:52] praise the lord
[1:25:53] he says the entire message will meet the
[1:25:56] end time condition
[1:26:02] that's what he said
[1:26:06] so you say you got we you ha we have to
[1:26:08] understand the zeal of the lord
[1:26:11] because that's the kind of a zeal that
[1:26:13] we want to be under
[1:26:16] we don't want to build our own zeals
[1:26:20] praise the lord we want to be honored
[1:26:23] his zeal
[1:26:24] we want he's the one to be the one
[1:26:26] leading he said the same thing there in
[1:26:29] zechariah's it's not going to be by
[1:26:31] power it's not going to be by mine
[1:26:34] it's going to be by my spirit
[1:26:38] the zeal of the law will build this
[1:26:40] house
[1:26:47] but i'm saying she's never depending on
[1:26:49] our human ability
[1:26:52] when he make his promise
[1:26:54] he's depending on his strength
[1:26:57] he's depending on his ability he's only
[1:27:00] looking for the person that will says
[1:27:02] i'm willing yeah am i
[1:27:06] praise the lord
[1:27:07] amen and pressing i will just surround
[1:27:10] themself
[1:27:14] that would just make themselves
[1:27:15] available
[1:27:18] that's the way i learned to understand
[1:27:20] that word
[1:27:22] yield the members of your body make
[1:27:25] yourself available
[1:27:29] praise the lord
[1:27:31] amen just make yourself available
[1:27:36] he saw that unavailable duncan he says
[1:27:38] bring that donkey i would ride on their
[1:27:40] ass and go down
[1:27:41] all the other donkeys were busy
[1:27:46] he said go down there there's a donkey
[1:27:48] that is available don't lose it bring it
[1:27:52] praise the lord i wish i could be an
[1:27:54] available donkey
[1:27:57] for the lord
[1:28:00] hallelujah
[1:28:05] so that's the picture that i want you to
[1:28:07] to to to keep in your mind tonight and
[1:28:10] and meditate upon it let the holy spirit
[1:28:12] digest it in your soul
[1:28:15] is that if for
[1:28:18] the coming
[1:28:21] of
[1:28:22] christ in flesh
[1:28:24] in mary
[1:28:27] the view of the lord performed that
[1:28:31] how much more
[1:28:34] of god being made flesh in you
[1:28:37] the promise of the holy ghost
[1:28:41] making you an overcomer
[1:28:44] having his preeminence in your life
[1:28:47] is now what you
[1:28:55] the do of the lord
[1:28:57] will perform that let's let's just look
[1:28:59] at some few types here i won't keep you
[1:29:00] long tonight
[1:29:02] if you look into the word you will
[1:29:03] realize that
[1:29:06] uh
[1:29:13] you love the lord tonight
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:21] in genesis chapter 25
[1:29:24] the bible speaks about finney house
[1:29:28] praise the lord
[1:29:30] now what you want to realize here is
[1:29:32] that fene heist was not the messenger
[1:29:35] the messenger was moses
[1:29:38] moses was the one that was called to the
[1:29:41] exit
[1:29:42] he was the one that was called to lead
[1:29:44] the people he met the
[1:29:46] the the burning bush he met the pillar
[1:29:48] of fire he was the one that had the
[1:29:51] commission
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:55] and why he brought the message and
[1:29:58] everything and the people were in the
[1:29:59] adjoining there was something that
[1:30:02] happened when the people got down there
[1:30:03] to buy poor
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:08] they started mixing themselves up with
[1:30:10] the word
[1:30:13] and we know there was a lot of
[1:30:14] mismultitude that joined the camp
[1:30:17] and
[1:30:18] uh and pretty soon
[1:30:21] they started
[1:30:23] you know missing himself there
[1:30:25] uh with the word in and and here we find
[1:30:28] that uh
[1:30:30] uh uh
[1:30:32] the god to this place and the people
[1:30:34] says
[1:30:35] the bible says the people you know the
[1:30:38] eighth and then the rose up to play that
[1:30:40] was the way paul distributed
[1:30:44] they were brought down to this feast
[1:30:49] and uh we see the children of israel you
[1:30:52] read the rest of the story there in
[1:30:54] numbers chapter 25
[1:30:55] the churn of israel got down to this
[1:30:57] feast and and and yeris said they are
[1:31:00] lingering with
[1:31:01] with uh
[1:31:03] the people of the land and they started
[1:31:05] doing things and i mean they got drunk
[1:31:07] and they started misbehaving
[1:31:10] and pretty soon they're no longer paying
[1:31:12] paying attention
[1:31:14] to the messenger
[1:31:18] they want to be free like the rest of
[1:31:20] the denominations around them why we can
[1:31:22] do this while we can do this
[1:31:25] the only reason why we can do this is
[1:31:26] that brother branham said brother
[1:31:28] branham say
[1:31:34] praise the lord because people think
[1:31:37] that's the way
[1:31:38] that uh
[1:31:40] uh i mean
[1:31:42] they think that's the way we keep you in
[1:31:43] bondage
[1:31:45] right
[1:31:46] for like they say that's the way that
[1:31:48] you know the message keeps you in
[1:31:50] bondage because everything brother
[1:31:51] brandon said brother branham said
[1:31:55] praise the lord i don't know how we're
[1:31:57] keeping you bunnies who call you
[1:32:05] we never went and arrested you from your
[1:32:07] house you brought yourself
[1:32:14] now so pretty soon they were not they
[1:32:15] were not paying attention to moses
[1:32:18] and like the scripture who tells us
[1:32:20] there you know well they got so much
[1:32:22] into this until
[1:32:25] they started defying themselves breaking
[1:32:27] the lord of god
[1:32:32] running around with uh with with the
[1:32:34] people of the land the more about faith
[1:32:35] and all of those things that were
[1:32:36] happening there
[1:32:38] and here we see it i'm trying to give
[1:32:41] you a picture
[1:32:42] of when a man comes under the zeal of
[1:32:45] the lord
[1:32:47] completely different than when he
[1:32:49] creates his own zeal
[1:32:53] when he's driving by his own zeal and
[1:32:56] trying to make it the zoo of the lord
[1:33:02] so yeah the people
[1:33:04] they're getting in this order and
[1:33:05] they're doing things and you know and
[1:33:07] all of that and and uh
[1:33:10] and then pretty soon they're no longer
[1:33:13] listening to moses
[1:33:17] as the prophet is crying now stay in
[1:33:19] line stay in line
[1:33:21] he says in the vision they were now
[1:33:23] looking at the wallet church and they
[1:33:26] started stepping out of line and he's
[1:33:28] crying still in line
[1:33:32] until he came out of the vision stay
[1:33:34] crying stay in line
[1:33:38] they are not listening to moses again
[1:33:39] he's crying stay in line we are on our
[1:33:42] journey we're not settling down here
[1:33:46] and right honor the voice of the
[1:33:48] messenger
[1:33:56] this hebrew man took
[1:34:00] a strange girl into the tent right under
[1:34:02] the voice of the messenger
[1:34:06] praise the lord
[1:34:11] and this young man
[1:34:14] he was not a leader
[1:34:18] he was not a leader
[1:34:21] he was none of those men like like like
[1:34:23] joshua and all of those people that were
[1:34:25] closer he was not a leader
[1:34:32] but something came upon his heart
[1:34:35] his desire was not to take over the
[1:34:38] exodus
[1:34:40] his desire was to stop the evil
[1:34:43] that was happening in the camera
[1:34:47] praise the lord
[1:34:50] amen
[1:34:51] that was his desire
[1:34:53] his desire was to correct
[1:34:56] the evil that is in the camp
[1:34:58] because sooner he realized that
[1:35:00] if we let this go it will influence
[1:35:03] every one of us
[1:35:06] pretty soon my mind my my dad will leave
[1:35:10] my mom and start running after another
[1:35:12] woman
[1:35:16] pretty soon i myself as a young man i
[1:35:18] will i would not want to to take a a
[1:35:21] a a a strange woman
[1:35:31] and the scripture says he took
[1:35:33] a weapon
[1:35:36] and that most both the man and the woman
[1:35:39] right there
[1:35:42] and when he did that
[1:35:49] the bible says he held back the wrath of
[1:35:51] god
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:04] in verse 11
[1:36:06] verse 10 and the lord speak unto moses
[1:36:08] saying infinity phinehas
[1:36:10] the son of
[1:36:12] eliza the son of aaron the priests have
[1:36:15] turned my raft away
[1:36:17] from the children of israel
[1:36:19] why he was zealous
[1:36:22] for my sake
[1:36:28] he was zealious for my sake
[1:36:31] he's identified under the zeal of the
[1:36:33] lord
[1:36:40] why because
[1:36:41] he had the courage to rise up and stop
[1:36:44] something that was rising in the camp
[1:36:56] he was listening to the prophet
[1:36:58] voice or listening to the prophet
[1:37:00] message and realized that the people is
[1:37:02] doing something wrong completely wrong
[1:37:06] they have no they having no this no
[1:37:09] regard to what moses is saying
[1:37:13] and god says he was serious for my sake
[1:37:23] praise the lord
[1:37:36] the ministry of moses after seeing the
[1:37:39] supernatural
[1:37:41] and seeing everything that is saw in
[1:37:42] egypt
[1:37:44] he was one of those young men that
[1:37:46] witnessed
[1:37:47] the terror of pharaoh
[1:37:49] and the house man being drowned
[1:37:53] he was one of those young men
[1:37:56] that witnessed that
[1:37:58] praise the lord
[1:37:59] are we going to trash out of those
[1:38:01] experience
[1:38:06] are we going to trash all of those
[1:38:08] experience
[1:38:10] just because now we think we can be free
[1:38:16] are no longer in egypt
[1:38:20] no finney house was not willing
[1:38:24] praise the lord
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:27] he witnessed saying light and gushing
[1:38:30] and darkness all over egypt
[1:38:35] he witnessed the effect of applying the
[1:38:38] door on the lantern of the door post
[1:38:43] one of his best friend that was an
[1:38:45] egyptian boy at first born dying
[1:38:49] he witnessed all of that
[1:38:55] praise the lord
[1:39:00] so he was he he
[1:39:02] his life was affected by
[1:39:05] the ministry the message of moses
[1:39:10] and all he was trying to do
[1:39:16] all he was trying to do
[1:39:18] he was just playing his little part i i
[1:39:21] have to do something in my little corner
[1:39:24] because i don't believe that was the
[1:39:26] only evil eye that was happening that
[1:39:28] day
[1:39:29] there were a lot of men that were drunk
[1:39:31] and they were all sleeping all around
[1:39:33] and living all sorts of life he could
[1:39:35] not go around everybody he just thought
[1:39:37] that this one is before me i'm going to
[1:39:40] deal with it
[1:39:51] the seat of the lord god says he was
[1:39:54] zealious for my sake
[1:40:00] and he even pleased the lord to
[1:40:02] to to establish
[1:40:04] a covenant with any house
[1:40:11] because he allowed
[1:40:14] the message of moses to influence him
[1:40:17] he knew that that was not their final
[1:40:19] destination
[1:40:21] he knew there was a joint in the head
[1:40:22] there was a promised land to ghetto
[1:40:34] praise the lord
[1:40:42] i'll take another
[1:40:43] another comparison here and
[1:40:46] leave you for the night
[1:40:52] second king chapter 10
[1:40:57] it will be this man called jehold
[1:41:02] you have to remember
[1:41:07] when the lord met elijah the prophet
[1:41:10] what does that hear elijah he says uh i
[1:41:13] alone left god said no having seven
[1:41:15] thousands that have now bowed down their
[1:41:16] needs to build
[1:41:19] he says go you annoyed
[1:41:21] elijah and you're still
[1:41:24] annoyed
[1:41:25] aiza that was a syrian king and annoyed
[1:41:28] jehu
[1:41:30] now this is what i want i want also so
[1:41:32] uh for you to be able to see it because
[1:41:35] because jehu was just
[1:41:38] another ordinary boy
[1:41:41] sure
[1:41:44] but the anointing
[1:41:47] of the prophet
[1:41:49] is going to change his life
[1:41:51] yes
[1:41:54] setting honor the prophet message is
[1:41:56] going to influence him
[1:41:58] in a different way
[1:42:02] you see the zeal of the law will not
[1:42:04] make you to do something contrary
[1:42:09] to the prophet of god
[1:42:11] it will not it will not make you a
[1:42:13] challenger to the prophet of god
[1:42:17] praise the lord
[1:42:20] so think that you are zealious and now
[1:42:21] there is there is a lot of error in the
[1:42:23] message and you are the one that is
[1:42:25] called to correct it
[1:42:31] you are simply saying the messenger
[1:42:33] failed in his work
[1:42:35] that's what you are saying
[1:42:50] praise the lord
[1:42:51] but you will realize that all of these
[1:42:54] men that was anointed a lot that god
[1:42:57] told elijah to annoy
[1:43:00] the reason was just to finish the work
[1:43:05] it was not to correct the work of elijah
[1:43:08] but to finish his work because elijah
[1:43:11] was the one that prophesied that the dog
[1:43:13] would like the blood of ahat
[1:43:16] and it took the anointing of elijah on
[1:43:19] aheza because he was the captain of the
[1:43:21] syrians that brought war against israel
[1:43:24] honor which they have died
[1:43:29] praise the lord it was elijah that said
[1:43:32] that the the the doors were laid jesse
[1:43:35] their blood
[1:43:36] it will have to take the anointing of
[1:43:39] elijah on jehu
[1:43:43] because after he killed the prophet saw
[1:43:45] bob he saw uh jessica up in the in in in
[1:43:49] in
[1:43:50] a historic building and that very same
[1:43:53] anointing that killed the prophet obama
[1:43:55] went and smashed her through the window
[1:43:57] so what what was said it was the
[1:43:59] anointing of elijah continuing the work
[1:44:05] praise the lord
[1:44:06] it's it's because it's the anointing
[1:44:08] that does the work just like the prophet
[1:44:10] of god has spoken in the age and he's
[1:44:13] not yet we're not going to bring him
[1:44:14] back from the dead because we believe it
[1:44:16] was the spirit of the law that was upon
[1:44:18] him and that same spirit says upon the
[1:44:20] bride today
[1:44:23] we're not going to wait and wish that he
[1:44:24] comes back from the grave
[1:44:35] it's that spirit that is here on the
[1:44:37] bride on the fire for ministry to make
[1:44:39] sure that christ have a bride
[1:44:43] and the spirit that begin the work is
[1:44:45] able to finish it
[1:44:47] because it's the zero of the lord that
[1:44:49] performed his work
[1:44:51] it's not man intellectual
[1:44:54] it's not man's strength it's a zeal of
[1:44:56] the lord
[1:45:06] praise the lord
[1:45:25] just like i said you see paul
[1:45:28] over there
[1:45:42] i said romans chapter nine actually it's
[1:45:43] romans chapter 10.
[1:45:51] verse one burdens my heart desire and
[1:45:54] prayer
[1:45:55] to god for israel is that they
[1:45:58] might be safe
[1:46:00] for i bear them wrecker
[1:46:03] that they have a zeal of god
[1:46:07] but not with knowledge
[1:46:11] praise the lord
[1:46:12] for they been ignorant
[1:46:15] of god's righteousness is going about to
[1:46:17] establish their own righteousness
[1:46:23] their own righteousness
[1:46:26] and that's what man has done around this
[1:46:28] message
[1:46:30] god's righteousness comes by the word we
[1:46:33] are watched by the watching of the word
[1:46:36] it comes by the word after the word has
[1:46:39] taken hold of your life that's a
[1:46:40] conviction that's a new birth then the
[1:46:42] holy ghost starts to produce those
[1:46:44] things
[1:46:47] it's now when we bring measuring stick
[1:46:49] to church
[1:46:51] and say come and stand here let's see
[1:46:53] how your shoes is or how how your dress
[1:46:55] is
[1:46:58] you we can do all of those things
[1:47:01] they don't take sin from the heart they
[1:47:02] don't take the desire and we have to
[1:47:04] take the watching of the water by the
[1:47:07] world that brings conviction that's the
[1:47:09] thing that changed lives
[1:47:24] now when we bail him out of people's
[1:47:26] life
[1:47:28] we are not happy with this then we get
[1:47:30] inspiration
[1:47:33] then we go and find find coats to preach
[1:47:36] and blast
[1:47:42] being ignorant of the righteousness of
[1:47:44] god
[1:47:48] they establish their own righteousness
[1:47:52] they have not submitted themselves
[1:47:55] unto the righteousness of god
[1:48:00] for christ is the end of the lord
[1:48:02] for righteousness for everyone
[1:48:05] that believeth
[1:48:07] christ in you
[1:48:09] the hope of glory
[1:48:16] unless he changed our hearts unless he
[1:48:19] revealed himself to us
[1:48:24] unless he changed our heart
[1:48:28] and reveal himself to us yes
[1:48:38] we will establish our laws and rules and
[1:48:40] put ourselves in bondage
[1:48:43] because pretty soon we'll be condemned
[1:48:45] by those very things that we established
[1:48:48] and now we become hypocrites
[1:48:51] it's only righteousness when we do it
[1:48:53] but when other people do it no
[1:48:55] no no no
[1:48:57] nope
[1:48:59] we gotta rip it down we gotta tear it
[1:49:01] apart
[1:49:07] the god that spoke his word
[1:49:10] will be for me
[1:49:14] we perform it our duty is to preach the
[1:49:16] earnest truth
[1:49:18] we must preach the whole counsel of god
[1:49:20] to you
[1:49:26] praise the lord
[1:49:36] for moses describe the righteousness of
[1:49:38] god
[1:49:39] which is of the lord
[1:49:42] that a man which does those things shall
[1:49:45] live by them
[1:49:46] and no may have been able to
[1:49:48] but the righteousness wishes of faith
[1:49:51] speak on these wise
[1:49:53] saying that in the heart
[1:49:55] who shall ascend into heaven
[1:49:58] for that is
[1:50:00] to bring christ
[1:50:01] down from above
[1:50:04] praise the lord
[1:50:06] or we shall descend into the deep that
[1:50:08] is to bring up christ again from the
[1:50:10] dead
[1:50:11] but what but what serious if the word is
[1:50:14] nigh thee
[1:50:17] even in their mouth
[1:50:19] what is that what does that mean
[1:50:22] confess the promises of god
[1:50:25] confess what god says about you
[1:50:30] and then your body will obey your
[1:50:32] confession
[1:50:35] when you see it in the word take it as
[1:50:38] your own and confess it
[1:50:40] the word is an id even in the mouth
[1:50:50] we only look in the word for what we
[1:50:51] want for other people we don't see what
[1:50:54] is for us
[1:50:56] that's the problem
[1:50:58] that's the problem
[1:51:01] bible says jesus have perfect faith
[1:51:03] because he could identify himself in the
[1:51:06] word
[1:51:08] praise the lord
[1:51:14] why the lord could achieve
[1:51:17] the promise of this hour in the life of
[1:51:18] brother branham
[1:51:21] praise the lord you you just think about
[1:51:23] it look at this did this scripture is
[1:51:24] fulfilled better man is preaching
[1:51:26] a birth pains
[1:51:29] with a new bible god set the scene
[1:51:32] god set the scene just to be able to
[1:51:34] grab his prophet attention
[1:51:39] after brother brandon preached the
[1:51:41] message he said i left
[1:51:44] keep thinking about what happened
[1:51:49] he said he kept thinking about what
[1:51:51] happened when he went in the hotel
[1:51:55] just imagine wherever i came back that
[1:51:57] evening
[1:51:59] to the businessman to explain to them
[1:52:01] what happened this morning
[1:52:02] he said while i was in the hotel the
[1:52:04] holy spirit reminded me and said look
[1:52:07] it's in luke chapter four
[1:52:13] look and see luke chapter four
[1:52:18] there is nothing in this message that is
[1:52:20] out of scripture
[1:52:22] amen
[1:52:24] there is nothing in this message that is
[1:52:27] out of scripture let me tell you the end
[1:52:29] time message
[1:52:30] is the fulfillment of scripture
[1:52:32] that's what the message is
[1:52:36] it's the fulfillment of scripture
[1:52:39] peter said we are not following calling
[1:52:41] devised people
[1:52:42] we are following fulfilled scripture
[1:52:45] that's what makes the message sweet when
[1:52:47] you can see it in the scripture
[1:52:55] he says the holy spirit reminded him go
[1:52:57] back
[1:52:58] he went back look it's in luke chapter
[1:53:01] four then all the picture starts to come
[1:53:03] together you say oh my god
[1:53:13] he said he went back
[1:53:16] and all through that the voice that was
[1:53:19] that was sinking in in his head
[1:53:22] just listening to but uh this day this
[1:53:24] scripture is fulfilled the first series
[1:53:26] he said it kept singing in my head this
[1:53:29] day
[1:53:29] this scripture is fulfilled this day
[1:53:33] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:53:36] that's what the message is
[1:53:40] it's fulfilled scripture
[1:53:45] is fulfilled scripture
[1:53:59] but the righteousness of god wishes of
[1:54:01] faith speak on this wise
[1:54:06] verse 8 is verse 8 i was so sorry
[1:54:08] but what's heretic the word is 90
[1:54:12] even in the mouth
[1:54:15] and in the heart
[1:54:17] that is the word of faith
[1:54:19] which we preach
[1:54:23] that if thou shalt confess with their
[1:54:25] mouth
[1:54:26] the lord jesus
[1:54:29] and shall believe in the heart
[1:54:31] that god has raised him from the dead
[1:54:34] that shall be saved you see what the
[1:54:37] church did to this is that they point
[1:54:39] the people back to calvary
[1:54:44] that that is the evil thing that they
[1:54:46] did
[1:54:49] because when you read this scripture
[1:54:50] what they do is that they take the
[1:54:52] people's mind back to cavalry you got to
[1:54:54] believe
[1:54:56] jesus of that day
[1:54:59] they send them back to a historical
[1:55:02] scene
[1:55:03] when the word year is the same yesterday
[1:55:06] today and forever
[1:55:15] so the church says well you got to
[1:55:17] believe that they tell you you believe
[1:55:18] that jesus died you believe he came in
[1:55:20] jerusalem he went to the cross for you
[1:55:22] on gogota they create all of the
[1:55:24] historical sin in your mind
[1:55:26] right
[1:55:29] and then you cannot see
[1:55:31] the present day
[1:55:33] christ
[1:55:35] that is raising
[1:55:38] amen
[1:55:40] that's why the prophet preached a
[1:55:41] message is the raising of the son
[1:55:46] in christ
[1:55:47] the rose has risen in our day
[1:55:51] he has raised in our day
[1:55:54] out of the pages of his word
[1:56:00] that's what the message is people
[1:56:03] it's fulfilled scripture
[1:56:07] that's the thing that brings strength
[1:56:10] when you can see it in the word
[1:56:14] when you can see it in the word
[1:56:18] it's not something that you're hearing
[1:56:20] on tapes or reading in the message and
[1:56:21] there is no way you can trace it back to
[1:56:23] the word
[1:56:24] you can find it
[1:56:32] the lord bless you tonight musicians you
[1:56:34] can come
[1:56:54] before we pray let's just sing their
[1:56:55] song now let's stand on our feet the
