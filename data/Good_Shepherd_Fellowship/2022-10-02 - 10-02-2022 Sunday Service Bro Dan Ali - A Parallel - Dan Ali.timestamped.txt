[51:55] and I just collected it
[51:57] and the truck behind me also just came
[52:00] and founded me off
[52:02] and I said what is this that was
[52:04] accident
[52:06] praise be to God
[52:09] um we came down we exchanged uh
[52:12] our insurance information I got to work
[52:15] before I started feeling pain in my neck
[52:18] and then my hair started aching and I
[52:21] felt funny in my back
[52:24] um I haven't gone to the hospital yet
[52:25] maybe tomorrow I'm not sure
[52:28] praise be to God
[52:30] yes
[52:31] and in all of this God has his eyes on
[52:34] his children
[52:36] praise be to God
[52:38] when the devil thinks he has cornered
[52:40] you
[52:41] God always makes a way out
[52:46] I want to work anyhow the following day
[52:49] I went to work I didn't call in
[52:51] and I'm strong I'm healthy
[52:54] if I have to go to the hospital tomorrow
[52:56] I will go maybe for the fun of it
[52:58] but by the grace of God I'm feeling fine
[53:01] praise be to God
[53:06] oh my
[53:08] we love the almighty God
[53:12] whenever you are coming to the house of
[53:15] God
[53:16] just come with your husband
[53:20] can't believe in that you will hear from
[53:22] God
[53:25] because God is here
[53:28] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[53:31] name there I am in their midst God is in
[53:33] the midst of his people
[53:35] praise be to God
[53:38] having said that can we just write
[53:40] before I forget let's just read a
[53:43] scripture
[53:44] and I will see what the Lord has for us
[53:46] this morning
[53:47] praise be to God shall we turn our
[53:50] Bibles to Genesis 15 13.
[54:04] oh
[54:14] Genesis 15 13.
[54:18] and he said unto Abraham
[54:20] nor for as she already
[54:23] that thy seed
[54:26] shall be a stranger
[54:28] in a land that is not yes
[54:31] and Shall Serve them and they shall
[54:34] afflict them 400 years praise be to God
[54:38] shall we go to Exodus
[54:41] 3 7.
[54:44] Exodus 3 7.
[54:48] Exodus 3 7.
[54:53] 7 and 8.
[55:06] and the last side
[55:08] I have surely seen the Affliction of my
[55:11] people which are in Egypt
[55:13] and I've heard their Cry by reason of
[55:17] their task Masters
[55:18] for I know their sorrows
[55:21] and I am come down to deliver them out
[55:24] of the land of Egypt out of the land of
[55:26] the Egyptians and to bring them up out
[55:29] of that land
[55:30] out to a good land and a lodge until a
[55:35] land flowing with milk and honey unto
[55:37] the place of the Canaanites and the
[55:40] Hittites and the amorites and the
[55:43] parasites and the hivites and the
[55:46] jebusites
[55:47] praise be to God may the Lord add His
[55:51] blessings to the reading of his word in
[55:53] Jesus name
[55:54] shall we be seated
[55:59] praise be to God
[56:02] I'm here this morning
[56:05] to remind us
[56:09] that time is running out
[56:14] the title of my message this morning
[56:19] is
[56:21] a parallel
[56:24] a parallel
[56:27] last Wednesday
[56:30] my brother one was preaching he
[56:32] mentioned
[56:37] he says something I'm paraphrasing it
[56:40] I'm not quoting him way to word he said
[56:43] that
[56:45] the kingdom
[56:48] of Babylon
[56:50] everything
[56:51] God is doing
[56:54] from The Book of Genesis parallels
[56:57] what God did in the Kingdom
[56:59] of Babylon
[57:01] so when he used that word parallel
[57:04] I said no I will use it for a theme
[57:08] for today
[57:09] and what is parallel
[57:14] I took the definition this morning
[57:16] sitting in the pastor's office
[57:19] parallel means
[57:21] a person
[57:23] or thin
[57:25] that is similar or analogous to another
[57:31] if the word analogous is confusing just
[57:34] leave it on the side
[57:36] praise the Lord
[57:38] a person or sin everything that is
[57:44] either a story
[57:47] either a documentary
[57:49] whatever that is
[57:51] a narrative
[57:54] is similar to another
[57:57] praise be to God
[58:00] that is why the word parallel means and
[58:03] I'm using that for a team this morning a
[58:06] parallel
[58:08] and as I said
[58:09] I'm here to remind us
[58:13] that time indeed is running out
[58:17] there is no more time
[58:24] tonight
[58:27] maybe the time God decides to wrap it
[58:30] all up
[58:32] it could also be tomorrow
[58:35] it could also be a hundred years from
[58:38] today
[58:39] but whether it is tonight or a hundred
[58:42] years from today I am saying that time
[58:45] is no more
[58:47] time indeed is running out and if there
[58:51] was any time that we should mean
[58:52] business with God it is now
[59:00] if there is any time
[59:04] don't look at Mommy
[59:06] don't look at Daddy
[59:08] don't look at your brother or a sister
[59:12] God deals with that on individual basis
[59:16] if there is any time you ought to make
[59:18] business with God it is now
[59:25] what is keeping you
[59:27] back
[59:29] last Sunday on our way to church I was
[59:33] coming with Emmanuel and God's Will and
[59:35] they said they wanted something so we
[59:36] passed to the gas station on our Zen I
[59:39] was outside there I give them money to
[59:41] go in and they about whatever they
[59:42] wanted so when they came out of the
[59:44] truck I was sitting inside and I had it
[59:47] there was a gentleman in front there
[59:49] talking to them
[59:50] I didn't hear what he was saying but
[59:52] then he signaled me
[59:54] asking me to to to to to roll down my
[59:57] window which I did and he told me that
[1:00:00] he was talking to
[1:00:02] um the Deacon and the pastor
[1:00:05] they were going inside referring to
[1:00:08] these two boys
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:11] so I started laughing
[1:00:13] and then he came closer
[1:00:15] he said it's a good thing that when he
[1:00:18] was small he was a bad boy and I could
[1:00:22] see traces of it on him
[1:00:25] He Is We are probably the same age group
[1:00:30] but he had a mother
[1:00:33] who was a Pentecostal mother
[1:00:36] who kept praying for him
[1:00:40] and how true is the story
[1:00:43] that we are here today because somebody
[1:00:45] prayed for us
[1:00:47] and if you are praying and trusting God
[1:00:49] for somebody or for whatever it is
[1:00:52] keep praying and keep believing
[1:00:55] God Will Never Let You Down
[1:00:58] but as I was sitting down
[1:01:01] and he was telling me it's a boy was
[1:01:03] once very bad I told him I was also very
[1:01:05] bad
[1:01:07] oh
[1:01:08] as I was also very bad
[1:01:12] but it's by the grace of God
[1:01:14] there he was standing in front and he
[1:01:16] went back there he was smoking cigar
[1:01:19] and then he told me that he was on his
[1:01:22] way to church
[1:01:24] and I was sitting down looking at this
[1:01:25] man that was on his way to church
[1:01:28] holding a cigar and then smoking
[1:01:33] and I kept asking myself I say if on his
[1:01:36] way to church he had to stop over to
[1:01:39] take cigar before going then I wonder
[1:01:43] what he would do on a day he's not going
[1:01:45] to church
[1:01:46] foreign
[1:01:56] demon
[1:02:00] it wasn't the first time I was seeing
[1:02:02] somebody smoking too and he swear to
[1:02:03] church no
[1:02:04] I have seen that over and over
[1:02:08] even in church
[1:02:11] sometimes you go to a place
[1:02:13] and a brother walks in and you can smell
[1:02:16] smoke on him
[1:02:17] you think he passed through the chimney
[1:02:19] before coming to church
[1:02:22] smelly smoke
[1:02:24] that was not my first time
[1:02:26] here there was a brother one service was
[1:02:28] going on he would go out there stand in
[1:02:31] front of the smoke and come back in we
[1:02:33] had to talk to him
[1:02:35] I don't care if you smoke 10 packets a
[1:02:37] day
[1:02:38] if that is the choice you have made that
[1:02:40] is up to you but it's not a good thing
[1:02:44] when we have children you go stand what
[1:02:47] are you teaching the children
[1:02:48] right right
[1:02:52] praise be to God
[1:02:55] somewhere last two months
[1:02:59] there was a young man that had a court
[1:03:01] case a serious court case a case that
[1:03:05] could turn somebody's life for good
[1:03:08] I don't want to go into the details
[1:03:10] and can you imagine you know we take the
[1:03:13] things of God for granted
[1:03:16] this man on that day when he was going
[1:03:19] to appear before the jury
[1:03:22] he was Horus of course I wasn't there if
[1:03:26] I was there I wouldn't have gotten this
[1:03:27] story to tell because it wouldn't have
[1:03:30] happened
[1:03:31] he was holding something
[1:03:33] wrapped in a piece of paper very long
[1:03:36] and he had another person beside him
[1:03:38] with his pants on the back
[1:03:41] both of them were holding each one each
[1:03:44] and guess what
[1:03:48] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:03:52] I shall not want foreign
[1:03:57] this is somebody that was appearing
[1:04:00] before the jury and this guy that was
[1:04:02] standing behind him the same thing ah my
[1:04:05] man I got you God will not let you down
[1:04:11] it is not
[1:04:12] the people
[1:04:19] to think that it is okay
[1:04:24] that the bad animals serve god with any
[1:04:26] reverence
[1:04:28] right
[1:04:30] somebody that ought to be on his knees
[1:04:33] crying to God
[1:04:35] asking for his Mercy for his divine
[1:04:38] intervention
[1:04:39] rather he went and took drug he was
[1:04:41] smoking weed
[1:04:45] while she was doing that and calling
[1:04:46] upon the name of the Lord
[1:04:50] now
[1:04:53] the Sinners are not the enemies of the
[1:04:56] Gospel
[1:04:57] the enemies of the Gospel are those who
[1:05:01] are holding this Bible
[1:05:03] and they are parading themselves
[1:05:06] preachers in the street
[1:05:08] and deceiving the
[1:05:15] Kingdom you know it is one thing when
[1:05:18] you are told the truth and you decide
[1:05:21] not to abide by it
[1:05:25] is another thing when you are being
[1:05:27] deceived into thinking that what you are
[1:05:30] doing is okay
[1:05:32] and a lot of the times these people are
[1:05:34] being deceived into thinking oh it's
[1:05:37] okay I can do anything why because there
[1:05:41] is a preacher somewhere behind a puppet
[1:05:43] that is telling them it's okay God is a
[1:05:46] loving God God will not put you to hell
[1:05:48] you know what lesbians and homosexuals
[1:05:51] are going to heaven who told you that
[1:05:54] if God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for
[1:05:57] this course why would God send
[1:06:01] s so I mean sodomize lesbians and
[1:06:04] homosexuals why would God turn around
[1:06:06] and send them into heaven
[1:06:13] and the other day I was surprised to
[1:06:15] hear
[1:06:17] that a pastor in this message
[1:06:20] is preaching somewhere
[1:06:23] that Satan is going to be in heaven
[1:06:29] and I asked myself
[1:06:32] so the brother said this in church
[1:06:35] and then the following Sunday he came
[1:06:37] back and met a congregation sitting down
[1:06:43] you have to run for your life
[1:06:46] if Satan is our brother and if Satan is
[1:06:50] going to be in heaven then why should I
[1:06:52] even come to church
[1:06:54] man why should I even serve God
[1:06:58] but can you imagine in this message
[1:07:01] in this message I am not talking of in
[1:07:05] this message
[1:07:10] Satan is never our brother
[1:07:13] he will never be
[1:07:14] he has never been and he will never be
[1:07:18] we are not going to spend eternity with
[1:07:20] Satan no way
[1:07:23] praise be to God
[1:07:26] this is how much
[1:07:30] people having deceived
[1:07:35] be merciful
[1:07:37] to the people out there that are doing
[1:07:39] the wrong things
[1:07:40] some of them genuinely do
[1:07:45] if some of them actually know what they
[1:07:47] are doing they will run for shelters
[1:07:51] can you imagine the other day talking to
[1:07:53] a colleague at work
[1:07:55] and he was telling me somebody
[1:07:56] prophesied that the world was going to
[1:07:58] end that was last two weeks Saturday
[1:08:01] and I told him don't believe in that
[1:08:03] nonsense
[1:08:04] why because somebody told about certain
[1:08:07] things and they happened so now he's
[1:08:09] saying the word is going I said don't
[1:08:10] believe in that
[1:08:12] I say it's only God who can tell and I
[1:08:16] asked him now you believe in that so
[1:08:19] what are you doing about your life
[1:08:22] you believe that God
[1:08:24] judgment is coming the word will be
[1:08:26] destroyed on Saturday what are you doing
[1:08:28] you are sitting out and waiting for it
[1:08:33] the people were talking about the world
[1:08:36] ending and yet they were not doing
[1:08:39] anything about their lives they were
[1:08:41] just sitting down and sitting ducks
[1:08:43] waiting and I took that to encourage him
[1:08:48] now
[1:08:50] even if the devil has succeeded
[1:08:54] if if the devil has succeeded in
[1:08:58] convincing you
[1:09:00] that you are not going to heaven
[1:09:03] and that you are not even good enough
[1:09:06] to go to heaven and you have believed it
[1:09:10] if you can believe the lie of the devil
[1:09:12] over the word of God if you have chosen
[1:09:15] to believe it I still encourage you keep
[1:09:18] moving on
[1:09:20] keep pressing on
[1:09:23] you may never know what God is going to
[1:09:25] do with the little step of Faith you
[1:09:27] take
[1:09:29] like the four lepers
[1:09:31] that were either entering in of the city
[1:09:34] of Samaria
[1:09:36] there was farming on the land
[1:09:38] and then they sat down they may have sat
[1:09:40] down for so long
[1:09:42] the handouts were not coming because the
[1:09:44] people in the city were hungry
[1:09:46] so where are you going to get food
[1:09:48] and they may have sat down and then
[1:09:50] thought you know what let's get into the
[1:09:52] city
[1:09:53] because when you listen to the
[1:09:55] conversation I believe something like
[1:09:57] that happened because they said if we
[1:10:00] even go into the city there is so
[1:10:02] farming day we are going to die anyhow
[1:10:05] so that means there was a conversation
[1:10:07] to that effect
[1:10:08] and I said you know what
[1:10:10] less than to the land of the syrians
[1:10:15] and Let's Fall in their hands
[1:10:17] we may live
[1:10:20] and if we die
[1:10:22] we are going to die anyhow
[1:10:24] man and when they started matching to
[1:10:27] the land of the syrians what is the
[1:10:29] serious here
[1:10:31] they had
[1:10:32] the footprints
[1:10:35] the sound of Tarios and of horses
[1:10:39] and I said oh our enemies are coming
[1:10:41] after us and they'll run into the
[1:10:44] mountains
[1:10:45] and this lepers just walked in and they
[1:10:47] had the booty of their lives not only
[1:10:50] did they get food
[1:10:52] but ornaments gold one of you
[1:10:56] praise be to God
[1:10:58] so you can never tell what God will do
[1:11:03] when you take that step of faith
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:09] just take that step of faith and see
[1:11:12] what God does
[1:11:16] praise be to God
[1:11:20] there is a divine orchestration
[1:11:24] behind your life
[1:11:28] there is a divine plan
[1:11:31] in your life
[1:11:34] praise be to God
[1:11:38] God told Abraham
[1:11:42] that your seed after you
[1:11:45] are going to be strangers
[1:11:49] in a land that is not yes
[1:11:52] and they will serve the people and
[1:11:55] they'll be afflicted 400 years
[1:11:59] but he did not end there there was a
[1:12:01] promise that he was going to bring them
[1:12:03] out of captivity
[1:12:07] God did not ask Abraham his opinion
[1:12:12] he did not tell Abraham
[1:12:15] he just told him what he was going to do
[1:12:19] he did not seek his permission
[1:12:23] praise be to God
[1:12:25] now
[1:12:27] if God had asked Abraham his opinion we
[1:12:30] all know what Abraham would have done
[1:12:32] because later in Abraham's years
[1:12:36] when God came down to destroy Sodom and
[1:12:38] Gomorrah
[1:12:39] and God said must I hide this from
[1:12:41] Abraham see that he has been so faithful
[1:12:44] to me and he is going to teach his
[1:12:47] children
[1:12:48] to follow the word must I had this from
[1:12:50] Abraham
[1:12:51] and he taught Abraham Abraham I am going
[1:12:54] to destroy this city
[1:12:56] and Abraham may have just looked and
[1:12:58] considered his nephew
[1:13:00] said no he may have post a long pause
[1:13:05] and he asked God
[1:13:08] would you destroy the righteous with the
[1:13:10] wicked
[1:13:13] this is not
[1:13:15] the god of righteousness
[1:13:17] will you destroy the righteous with the
[1:13:20] wicked
[1:13:22] God said no
[1:13:23] if their Adventure
[1:13:26] there were 50 righteous people in the
[1:13:28] city will you destroy it God said no
[1:13:33] they didn't find 50. what if there was
[1:13:36] 45
[1:13:37] God said no I wouldn't destroy it what
[1:13:40] if there was 40 God said no I wouldn't
[1:13:43] destroy it what if 30 20 10 they
[1:13:47] couldn't find 10 righteous people in the
[1:13:49] city
[1:13:52] what a merciful god we save
[1:13:58] if you find yourself at the wrong side
[1:14:00] it is not God who has put you there you
[1:14:04] out of your own lusts
[1:14:06] put yourself there
[1:14:09] so we know whatever
[1:14:19] whatever and it came to pass we all know
[1:14:21] the story
[1:14:23] how Israel ended up in Egypt
[1:14:26] and they were enslaved in Egypt
[1:14:29] they were punished indeed
[1:14:32] they were insulted they were looked down
[1:14:35] upon they did not regard them to be
[1:14:38] human beings
[1:14:39] the Egyptians did not regard them in any
[1:14:42] way
[1:14:44] and those people that the Egyptians
[1:14:46] disregarded so much and looked Upon Our
[1:14:50] slaves as captives good for nothing
[1:14:52] people
[1:14:53] there were a people after God's Own
[1:14:55] Heart
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:14:58] this was the people God his eyes were on
[1:15:01] them
[1:15:04] and they were going through everything
[1:15:06] they were going through
[1:15:08] they may have thoughts
[1:15:10] that they were out of the will of God
[1:15:13] did not send them to Egypt
[1:15:16] to go punished you know I just I'm done
[1:15:18] I'm just going there to go and punish
[1:15:20] them no
[1:15:21] there is a reason behind everything
[1:15:24] everything God does and it's always for
[1:15:28] our own good
[1:15:32] but there was a promise
[1:15:35] God said he was going to deliver them
[1:15:37] and God here they had their cry and God
[1:15:41] sent them a deliverer with a message
[1:15:44] with science and wonders following
[1:15:47] to deliver his people again we know the
[1:15:51] story fast forward now the children of
[1:15:55] Israel were delivered
[1:15:58] and in the wilderness before the Red Sea
[1:16:02] when they'll stand and saw chariots
[1:16:05] coming
[1:16:07] and there was that blowing in the air
[1:16:10] they just started crying
[1:16:13] I shouting
[1:16:16] against the prophet of God
[1:16:19] I Remember by the one preaching last
[1:16:21] Wednesday
[1:16:24] you know God has done a lot in our lives
[1:16:29] and even if he has not done it for us we
[1:16:32] can look at people in our Cycles
[1:16:35] and we can tell God is doing something
[1:16:37] and we can see the hand of God but when
[1:16:40] situations come
[1:16:42] we tend to forget all the good
[1:16:45] God has done
[1:16:48] and then in that process fear
[1:16:53] takes over
[1:16:54] and whenever fear takes over there is no
[1:16:57] longer Faith
[1:16:59] fear and faith do not dwell together why
[1:17:03] there is fear there is no faith
[1:17:06] and when these people are crying and
[1:17:09] Moses turned and passed judgment on them
[1:17:12] and God told Moses
[1:17:14] why Christ thou unto me
[1:17:16] and God says something just tell the
[1:17:20] people to move forward
[1:17:22] that they may see the glory of God
[1:17:27] just tell her to move forward now as I
[1:17:30] said my message today is a parallel
[1:17:35] that we are picking a story here
[1:17:38] and we can look at how God deals with
[1:17:40] them on this side and we can apply it
[1:17:43] here and you see that God is dealing
[1:17:46] with us on the same level
[1:17:48] come back okay
[1:17:50] praise be to God
[1:17:53] now
[1:17:55] the Bible says
[1:17:58] that God said let us create man in our
[1:18:00] own image
[1:18:02] and God created man in his own image and
[1:18:05] that was the spirit man
[1:18:11] there was a man in God's Own likeness
[1:18:16] but the Bible says that God had created
[1:18:19] everything on the earth everything was
[1:18:21] looking so fine so beautiful but there
[1:18:24] was no man to till the Earth
[1:18:29] and we know the story how God formed man
[1:18:32] after the dust of the earth and he put
[1:18:34] this man inside that body
[1:18:37] to kill the Earth
[1:18:38] it was not your decision
[1:18:41] to come into this life
[1:18:44] it was not your plan that you want to
[1:18:47] come on the planet Earth
[1:18:50] God did not ask man his opinion
[1:18:54] he did not ask man
[1:18:56] what he thought about it he did not ask
[1:18:59] men his permission
[1:19:02] as a matter of fact if God had given men
[1:19:06] the permission to choose there is no man
[1:19:08] that was going to come into this life
[1:19:10] if God was going to open Mass eyes just
[1:19:15] to see what he was going to go through
[1:19:16] on this Earth man would not come
[1:19:22] to be in the image of God in the glory
[1:19:25] of God and to see how you are coming to
[1:19:29] be in this past
[1:19:31] this past pest house as the prophet
[1:19:34] calls it
[1:19:35] full of sicknesses full of diseases
[1:19:40] that if you don't take your bath two
[1:19:41] three days
[1:19:42] you want to hide yourself
[1:19:45] and then the hatred
[1:19:47] the worst
[1:19:49] the the malice
[1:19:52] the the greed the confusion
[1:19:56] if God was going to open Man's eyes
[1:19:59] to see what he was going to go through
[1:20:02] I believe the way man would have cried
[1:20:04] and jumped and rode God probably would
[1:20:06] have changed his mind
[1:20:08] but as the prophet of God said God had
[1:20:12] in him an attribute to be a savior and
[1:20:15] accept something gets lost
[1:20:18] how was he going to exercise
[1:20:23] that attribute of being a savior
[1:20:28] so men had to come into this life
[1:20:31] praise be to God we had no choice
[1:20:37] now every man that was born into this
[1:20:40] life was born directly into sin
[1:20:43] foreign
[1:20:45] we are Sinners by representation
[1:20:48] Adam and Eve sent
[1:20:50] and whoever was brought into this life
[1:20:53] it doesn't matter where it was in the
[1:20:54] hospital whether it was in a cave
[1:20:56] somewhere whether it was in the street
[1:20:58] you were born a sinner
[1:21:00] whether in the palace you were born a
[1:21:02] sinner
[1:21:03] we couldn't help it so we were born
[1:21:06] directly into captivity
[1:21:11] and we came into this life
[1:21:14] and all we knew was living in sin
[1:21:19] telling lies
[1:21:23] doing things we shouldn't do and as a
[1:21:26] matter of fact one who are living that
[1:21:28] life we enjoyed it
[1:21:32] because it was our nature
[1:21:35] that is the nature of sin into which man
[1:21:37] was born
[1:21:40] and you do this right wrong and you
[1:21:43] think oh I was smart The Devil Makes you
[1:21:45] to think oh I was smart
[1:21:47] you are not smart
[1:21:49] because smart people don't do the things
[1:21:51] we do
[1:21:53] you are living in error and you are
[1:21:56] happy with a life of Darkness a life of
[1:22:00] Sorrow
[1:22:01] and you are happy with it
[1:22:04] it shows how insane
[1:22:06] a man is
[1:22:09] outside of the economy of God
[1:22:14] because that was the nature of sin man
[1:22:16] was born into
[1:22:19] and then you come you do things live in
[1:22:23] error do all the things
[1:22:28] but as a child of God
[1:22:31] God is just a matter of time
[1:22:36] God deals with the Israelites as a
[1:22:39] nation
[1:22:40] and there was a time of Deliverance for
[1:22:42] them
[1:22:43] and God deals with us as individuals and
[1:22:46] there is a time of Deliverance for every
[1:22:48] child of God
[1:22:50] that is why when you can hear God
[1:22:53] knocking at the door of your heart you
[1:22:55] don't sit down and say no I'm waiting
[1:22:58] for this friend so we can go together
[1:22:59] I'm waiting for my son I'm waiting for
[1:23:02] mommy and daddy so we can go together
[1:23:03] God is not calling you as a family
[1:23:06] he is calling you as an individual
[1:23:09] when you hear the voice of God this day
[1:23:12] how do you not your heart
[1:23:14] when God is required to take a step of
[1:23:17] Faith take that step of faith
[1:23:22] praise be to God
[1:23:23] there is a time of Deliverance
[1:23:27] that God has sent us a prophet with a
[1:23:30] message
[1:23:31] the message of Miracle 4 5 and 6 is to
[1:23:35] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:23:37] faith of the apostolic fathers to get
[1:23:39] the people ready for the second coming
[1:23:42] of the Lord Jesus Christ to Deliver us
[1:23:44] from sin from iniquity from the life of
[1:23:48] Aaron to Deliver Us from what
[1:23:50] Superstition yes
[1:23:52] to deliver us
[1:23:54] from traditions
[1:23:56] to deliver us
[1:24:00] praise be to God
[1:24:03] there is power in this message
[1:24:07] if you want to experience
[1:24:10] the transformational power of God
[1:24:14] and not conform
[1:24:19] not just confirm
[1:24:21] to a church a geology
[1:24:24] but to to experience the
[1:24:26] transformational power of God
[1:24:28] you have it
[1:24:31] you have it
[1:24:34] you have the word
[1:24:37] and listening to pray around this moment
[1:24:43] that we shall all give an account to
[1:24:46] what we do with the word
[1:24:50] this word you are hearing today
[1:24:53] whatever you do with the word of God you
[1:24:56] are going to give an account of it
[1:24:59] there is power in this word of God to
[1:25:03] deliver
[1:25:04] there is power in the world to set the
[1:25:06] captive free
[1:25:08] there is power in the World to Change
[1:25:10] any circumstance
[1:25:12] without a doubt
[1:25:15] if you are not experiencing it check
[1:25:17] your life
[1:25:19] check your life if you are not
[1:25:22] experiencing it check your life examine
[1:25:25] yourself
[1:25:28] praise be to God
[1:25:30] and remember
[1:25:32] when God delivered the children of
[1:25:34] Israel
[1:25:36] pharaoh and his people sat down and they
[1:25:40] said oh what have you just done
[1:25:42] what have we just done
[1:25:44] we allow these people to go who is going
[1:25:47] to save us we need to get them back
[1:25:51] and they weren't just chasing them now
[1:25:56] the Lord Jesus said
[1:25:59] when an evil spirit
[1:26:02] is cast out of a man
[1:26:04] it just goes wandering around
[1:26:07] but it's going to come back
[1:26:10] and when it comes back is coming to look
[1:26:12] in there to see
[1:26:15] has the husband claimed
[1:26:18] sanitized
[1:26:21] is it empty
[1:26:24] and if the house is empty
[1:26:26] that evil spirit is going to bring what
[1:26:30] seven more wicked spirits
[1:26:32] and they are coming to live in that
[1:26:34] person and the end of that man is worse
[1:26:38] than his beginning
[1:26:44] they are not going to sit down
[1:26:46] and just look at you go
[1:26:49] they are going to come after you anyhow
[1:26:54] as pharaoh and his people pursue the
[1:26:56] children of Israel the demons those
[1:26:58] demons that were cast out they are going
[1:27:00] to come back anyhow
[1:27:03] and they are going to look in there
[1:27:06] if it's empty can you imagine if you
[1:27:09] were somebody like Mary Magdalene out of
[1:27:11] whom seven evil spirits were cast out
[1:27:14] a lot of the times when we are talking
[1:27:16] about evil spirits people say oh because
[1:27:18] you don't fly at night
[1:27:21] praise be to God
[1:27:28] because you don't fly at night
[1:27:30] you think you are clean
[1:27:34] Mary Magdalene was not flying
[1:27:37] she's like that
[1:27:39] those spirits
[1:27:41] Pride
[1:27:45] anger
[1:27:48] malice
[1:27:50] gossip
[1:27:51] bitterness
[1:27:55] just think about it
[1:27:58] just think about
[1:28:01] it but don't forget
[1:28:03] we are giving power in authority to cast
[1:28:06] every unclean Spirit out
[1:28:10] brother was here the other time and that
[1:28:12] was a topic he went to
[1:28:14] I'm not going that way tonight I mean
[1:28:16] this morning
[1:28:17] praise be to God
[1:28:19] so it's a choice
[1:28:22] if you want to entertain the spirit but
[1:28:25] remember as a child of God you are
[1:28:27] giving power and authority over every
[1:28:29] unclean spirit in your life
[1:28:34] don't sit down
[1:28:35] and entertain it
[1:28:37] or entertain them
[1:28:40] so those evil spirits when they are cast
[1:28:44] out
[1:28:45] and you clean the house and the house is
[1:28:49] left
[1:28:50] unoccupied
[1:28:51] they are coming back
[1:28:54] and if you had seven and all of them
[1:28:57] have to go back and bring more seven
[1:28:59] more wicked ones
[1:29:00] guess how many you have at the end of
[1:29:02] the day
[1:29:06] that is a terrible place to be isn't it
[1:29:15] and I see that the house is occupied
[1:29:20] Hallelujah they can't get in
[1:29:24] but that is why the battle starts
[1:29:27] that is where the Bible starts that is
[1:29:30] why the Mind battles us
[1:29:32] because they cannot get in doesn't mean
[1:29:34] that the virus has ended
[1:29:42] I'm tempted to go ahead of myself praise
[1:29:44] be to God
[1:29:46] the father they can't get in
[1:29:49] doesn't mean
[1:29:52] that it is over
[1:29:56] they are going to come at you
[1:30:01] in every way possible
[1:30:03] in every way possible
[1:30:11] and when they die when the enemies came
[1:30:15] and God told Moses tell the people to
[1:30:18] move forward
[1:30:19] let them move forward
[1:30:22] that they may see the glory of God
[1:30:25] and whatever situation you find yourself
[1:30:29] just keep moving forward
[1:30:33] anyone that puts his hand to the plow
[1:30:35] and tears back it's not worthy of the
[1:30:38] Gospel
[1:30:42] forward ever
[1:30:44] backward never
[1:30:46] we have not come this far only to go
[1:30:49] back
[1:30:51] we are in it for good
[1:30:55] after the Lord comes and we are out of
[1:30:58] here
[1:30:59] there is no stopping place
[1:31:04] but the sun says I have decided to
[1:31:07] follow Jesus
[1:31:09] don't not go with me yet I will follow
[1:31:14] when everyone else decides to go back
[1:31:17] and you are left alone keep going
[1:31:19] forward
[1:31:22] if you can't walk anymore and you have
[1:31:25] to crawl
[1:31:26] if you want to see the salvation of the
[1:31:28] Lord keep going forward
[1:31:32] and we saw we saw
[1:31:35] how did the Lord open the Red Sea and
[1:31:38] they went through it
[1:31:39] and pharaoh and his army all got drowned
[1:31:43] in it
[1:31:45] now
[1:31:48] we have been so privileged
[1:31:50] so privileged
[1:31:52] that we don't just talk about it because
[1:31:55] God allowed the camera to capture
[1:32:02] Angel of the Covenant
[1:32:05] Halloween over the prophet
[1:32:08] that we know
[1:32:10] for a surety now wherever this message
[1:32:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ goes it is it
[1:32:16] is a prophet's message
[1:32:18] it is not brother branham's message
[1:32:21] it is the message of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:24] Christ
[1:32:25] a life-changing message
[1:32:28] praise be to God there is so much power
[1:32:31] in this world my goodness if you want to
[1:32:34] be an overcomer just keep feeling on the
[1:32:37] way you would not know when those demons
[1:32:40] live
[1:32:41] you wouldn't know when
[1:32:43] you would just look around and you can't
[1:32:45] find them anymore
[1:32:47] praise be to God
[1:32:51] that angel that angel of the Covenant
[1:32:56] praise be to God
[1:32:58] look
[1:33:00] wherever you go
[1:33:05] that angel of the Covenant is there
[1:33:09] wherever this message goes
[1:33:11] this Angel of the Covenant is there
[1:33:16] praise be to God
[1:33:18] and if you want to see the salvation of
[1:33:20] the Lord
[1:33:21] the Bible says by day they were led by
[1:33:24] the pillar of cloud By Night by the
[1:33:26] pillar of fire and we have that Pillar
[1:33:29] of Fire behind us Lord
[1:33:30] praise be to God
[1:33:33] and just keep marching forward
[1:33:36] just keep marching forward
[1:33:39] do your part as a child of God there is
[1:33:42] a path that is God's Own Part you cannot
[1:33:45] do that for God just leave that for God
[1:33:48] just do what you're supposed to do what
[1:33:50] you are called to do keep marching
[1:33:53] forward and see the arm of God in your
[1:33:55] life Batman
[1:33:57] praise be to God
[1:33:59] the Bible says there as many of them
[1:34:02] that went to the Red Sea Under the cloud
[1:34:05] on the on the on under the cloud were
[1:34:08] baptized unto Moses so that is baptism
[1:34:11] now when you have come into this life as
[1:34:15] Sinner and you have done all those
[1:34:17] useless things those unprintable things
[1:34:20] so those despicable things and God has
[1:34:23] redeemed you and you have given your
[1:34:25] life to Christ you have become a new
[1:34:28] creation you have been baptized you are
[1:34:30] justified by faith now you are walking
[1:34:33] in the newness of your mind now it is
[1:34:37] not the Holy Ghost baptism but it is the
[1:34:40] work brother said the water baptism
[1:34:43] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:34:45] Ghost
[1:34:47] praise be to God you are Justified now
[1:34:52] they entered into the wilderness
[1:34:55] and that was the most challenging time
[1:34:59] of their Journey
[1:35:02] the most challenging time of their
[1:35:04] Journey
[1:35:05] a journey that was meant to last three
[1:35:08] days lasted 40 years
[1:35:11] that they kept on going in circles over
[1:35:15] and over over and over
[1:35:19] tempting God here and there
[1:35:22] go to Kadesh Banya when Moses chose one
[1:35:26] General is from every family and they
[1:35:29] went into the land spider land and they
[1:35:31] came back
[1:35:33] and 10 of them gave an evil report
[1:35:36] and when they gave that evil report
[1:35:39] all the children of Israel just started
[1:35:41] crying shouting and murmuring and
[1:35:43] complaining
[1:35:44] and God said no I have taken it too much
[1:35:48] this is why they'll be
[1:35:52] the art of the 2 million
[1:35:55] out of the 2 million
[1:35:57] that left Egypt
[1:35:59] only true enter the Promised Land
[1:36:03] the rest that went in were those that
[1:36:04] were born in the way it's a good thing
[1:36:08] to come out
[1:36:09] by coming
[1:36:11] up is not an indication that you have
[1:36:13] made it
[1:36:14] you can come out and still perish yeah
[1:36:20] you can get out all right it's a good
[1:36:23] thing
[1:36:26] until you enter his rest
[1:36:29] never rest
[1:36:33] we can see that in a lost wife
[1:36:37] before the destruction of Sodom and
[1:36:39] Gomorrah When Love left with his wife
[1:36:41] and two children
[1:36:42] on the way they were asked do not turn
[1:36:45] back
[1:36:46] lost wife turned back
[1:36:49] to see what was going on
[1:36:51] and we know the story
[1:36:55] she never made it
[1:36:57] she came out but she didn't make it
[1:37:03] keep examining your life
[1:37:06] by the word
[1:37:08] examining your life by day and By Night
[1:37:12] by the word
[1:37:16] we are in an age
[1:37:18] why people have itchy ears
[1:37:21] that they want to hear good things about
[1:37:23] themselves
[1:37:24] there is nothing wrong when you are told
[1:37:27] good things about yourself that is good
[1:37:30] but as a matter of fact sometimes you
[1:37:33] even know that people are lying to you
[1:37:38] imagine
[1:37:42] and somebody comes your brother Dan you
[1:37:45] have a small beautiful ear hey you know
[1:37:48] your eyes your ear is big
[1:37:50] thank you

[1:38:05] and I tell you you are living right you
[1:38:07] are doing good
[1:38:10] we buy into it
[1:38:12] we buy into it
[1:38:16] keep examining your life
[1:38:20] not by somebody else's life
[1:38:23] um says normies are special this morning
[1:38:27] he said those that compare themselves to
[1:38:29] others are not wise
[1:38:33] and she said it is silly
[1:38:36] for you to compare yourself to another
[1:38:38] person
[1:38:40] you are unique
[1:38:43] and special
[1:38:45] don't desire to be like somebody else
[1:38:49] be happy Who You Are
[1:38:51] what are somebody else is happy with you
[1:38:54] or not you be happy all right
[1:38:57] if you are not happy with you or for
[1:38:59] whatever reason that is their cup of tea
[1:39:03] they can drink it
[1:39:04] they can put in the refrigerator
[1:39:06] whatever they want to do with it that is
[1:39:09] their cup of tea
[1:39:10] you'll be happy
[1:39:11] with what God has made you
[1:39:17] people have itchy
[1:39:21] we don't want to have anything to do
[1:39:22] with the truth
[1:39:24] we want to live by lives
[1:39:31] examine yourself
[1:39:33] on a daily basis by the word
[1:39:39] if you come
[1:39:41] to church
[1:39:42] and you sit down and you hear the word
[1:39:45] of God preached under the power and the
[1:39:48] anointing of the Holy Spirit and you get
[1:39:51] up and you walk through the window I
[1:39:53] mean you walk out through the door and
[1:39:55] you didn't get anything from the service
[1:39:57] it is the most beautiful scene
[1:40:00] it's a very very
[1:40:02] uh what word do I use it's just a
[1:40:05] terrible state to be in
[1:40:08] that of all the things that was said
[1:40:11] nothing
[1:40:13] was there for you
[1:40:16] nothing was there for you
[1:40:23] praise be to God
[1:40:28] we are being led
[1:40:32] by the word
[1:40:35] and wherever this message goes remember
[1:40:38] that Pillar of Fire is still here
[1:40:40] following that message
[1:40:46] keep moving forward if you want to see
[1:40:48] the salvation of the Lord
[1:40:50] the place where a lot of us fail
[1:40:54] is when we get to that level that's
[1:40:56] sanctification level the hardest part of
[1:41:00] the journey
[1:41:02] that is why a lot of us give up
[1:41:05] that is why a lot a lot of us through
[1:41:07] our our hands in the air in despair
[1:41:12] it is the most difficult
[1:41:14] the most difficult part of the journey
[1:41:18] that things you have done in the past
[1:41:21] they keep coming after you and not only
[1:41:24] come after you but coming to take you
[1:41:27] back into the era into that life into
[1:41:31] that field you were living before
[1:41:33] that you keep struggling and fighting
[1:41:36] and you hear voices
[1:41:39] telling you to do something
[1:41:41] and you have the word now telling you
[1:41:44] know a terrible should not do this and
[1:41:46] you struggle with it you struggle with
[1:41:48] it
[1:41:49] you go you fight yourself day in day out
[1:41:53] you are sick in the face of God and you
[1:41:55] get to a place and you can hear the
[1:41:58] devil telling you or you are not never
[1:42:00] going to make it you are not a child of
[1:42:02] God have you forgotten the things you
[1:42:04] did oh come on and he knows why to press
[1:42:06] the buttons he knows what buttons to
[1:42:08] press
[1:42:10] and he can just mess your day up in one
[1:42:13] second
[1:42:15] and then get you just crying you know I
[1:42:20] mean put you in a very awful state
[1:42:24] the Devil is a fighter
[1:42:26] that is why you
[1:42:28] ought to mean business with God
[1:42:30] the Devil is a fighter
[1:42:33] because if I know I am coming to fight
[1:42:35] you
[1:42:36] and I see that you are stronger than me
[1:42:38] and I know you're going to bloody me I
[1:42:40] will not come
[1:42:42] right but when the devil knows
[1:42:45] that his legs are going to go up in the
[1:42:48] air he will still come
[1:42:53] he's never tired he never gives up
[1:42:57] he is a fighter
[1:43:03] that is why the Bible says they overcame
[1:43:05] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:43:07] words of their testimony
[1:43:11] no man is a match
[1:43:14] for the enemy
[1:43:18] but by the grace of God
[1:43:21] praise be to God
[1:43:26] to God we cannot withstand any child of
[1:43:27] God
[1:43:29] when you know your place as a child of
[1:43:31] God and when you have taken your
[1:43:33] position amen the devil is no match
[1:43:37] the devil is no match
[1:43:43] praise be to God the reason why we kept
[1:43:46] being tossed about here and there is
[1:43:49] because a lot of the times
[1:43:51] we forget Who We Are
[1:43:54] that is if we know who we are
[1:43:56] and sometimes
[1:43:58] we don't even know who we are
[1:44:01] sometimes we think we do
[1:44:03] situations come and then we begin to
[1:44:06] doubt
[1:44:11] problems would always come
[1:44:14] the storms will always come
[1:44:17] the storms when they come against you as
[1:44:20] a child of God it's just meant to make
[1:44:23] you stronger
[1:44:29] sometimes the storm is so strong
[1:44:32] like that Prophet gave an illustration
[1:44:34] then stop can come and take a tree on
[1:44:36] the other side and yes the tree would go
[1:44:39] down
[1:44:40] and sometimes you even see the roots
[1:44:42] coming up
[1:44:43] but guess what it has just losing the
[1:44:46] soil under that plant under that tree
[1:44:49] it's just going to develop extra roots
[1:44:51] to regroup the Sun
[1:44:54] and then it's just making the tree
[1:44:56] strong
[1:44:57] a storm when a storm comes against you
[1:45:01] as a child of God that storm is meant to
[1:45:04] make you stronger
[1:45:08] take your position
[1:45:11] take your position
[1:45:13] know who you are as a child of God
[1:45:17] praise be to God
[1:45:20] a lot of the times we fail
[1:45:24] in our Wilderness Journey
[1:45:27] and then we complain
[1:45:29] we mama
[1:45:31] we keep going in circles we keep going
[1:45:34] in circles
[1:45:35] job said naked I came and naked I will
[1:45:39] go back
[1:45:40] yes
[1:45:43] whatever you have in this life whatever
[1:45:46] that it is that you have acquired in
[1:45:48] this life
[1:45:49] the devil said that's the dusts why are
[1:45:52] you going with those things
[1:45:54] you are not going back with anything
[1:45:57] and if the family says oh we love this
[1:46:00] man so much or we love this brother so
[1:46:03] much we love this sister so much you
[1:46:06] know what let us put some good bars in
[1:46:08] that coffin and go and bury him you know
[1:46:11] what they have done you at the service
[1:46:16] because there are grave looters
[1:46:28] when you think you are resting at peace
[1:46:31] they will come and dig you out
[1:46:34] take that gold bar out and they are not
[1:46:37] going to bury you again
[1:46:39] they will leave you there for the
[1:46:41] vultures to come and take care
[1:46:43] praise the Lord
[1:46:45] foreign
[1:46:46] are you going with it
[1:46:48] you are never going to go with it anyhow
[1:46:51] my brother brother said that naked we
[1:46:54] get weak but we are going
[1:46:55] something
[1:46:56] that is character
[1:46:59] we are going back with character
[1:47:03] a character doesn't come when you sit
[1:47:06] in the chair and cross your legs
[1:47:09] and you are sipping coffee in the
[1:47:11] morning
[1:47:13] character
[1:47:15] character yeah it's not a gift
[1:47:19] character
[1:47:21] you struggle you got three truth is the
[1:47:24] Bible says that Jesus lent obedience by
[1:47:28] that is he suffered
[1:47:30] and that is character
[1:47:32] you learn character by the things you
[1:47:35] suffer by the things you go through you
[1:47:38] are learning character it is not an easy
[1:47:40] thing
[1:47:42] it's not an easy Journey
[1:47:47] it is something that when you are going
[1:47:49] through
[1:47:51] you have sleepless nights
[1:47:53] you would cry
[1:47:55] your prayer prayer praise love God is
[1:47:57] not hearing you
[1:47:59] you come out you wash your face
[1:48:02] people see you
[1:48:04] wonderful countenance
[1:48:07] but behind there
[1:48:08] you know what you're going through you
[1:48:11] know
[1:48:13] the storm
[1:48:14] that the devil has Unleashed against you
[1:48:16] you know the trials that you are going
[1:48:20] through
[1:48:22] God is building character in You by
[1:48:25] those things
[1:48:28] we are going with something
[1:48:31] better development it's not an easy
[1:48:34] thing
[1:48:35] we are going through things because
[1:48:38] there is something in US that must come
[1:48:41] out
[1:48:43] the child of God that you are must come
[1:48:47] out
[1:48:48] now people can look at you and they see
[1:48:51] nothing by the word of God
[1:48:54] they don't have to read the Bible
[1:48:55] they look at you and they see the Bible
[1:48:58] they look at you they see the message
[1:49:01] they look at you and they see Christ
[1:49:04] that is when
[1:49:07] the world has taken effect
[1:49:10] in your life
[1:49:12] praise be to God
[1:49:15] the children of Israel were taken across
[1:49:17] the Jordan
[1:49:19] God had given them the land
[1:49:21] but guess what they fought for every
[1:49:25] inch of the ground
[1:49:27] the promise was this
[1:49:29] you say that oh there were there were
[1:49:31] double size they were hitters there were
[1:49:33] there were they were amalekites they
[1:49:35] were all those types there were all of
[1:49:37] them on that line and it was theirs that
[1:49:39] land was not yes
[1:49:40] that was not for the jeopard size
[1:49:43] it was not for the hitters it was not
[1:49:45] for the invite no they were squatters
[1:49:50] when they were born and they were coming
[1:49:51] to this land did they bring land
[1:49:55] The God Who created the Heaven and Earth
[1:49:57] said that I give you this land I'm
[1:49:59] giving it to your descendants and that
[1:50:01] settless it
[1:50:04] praise be to God there was quarters
[1:50:08] the true land owners now have come but
[1:50:10] they had to fight
[1:50:12] for every inch of the ground
[1:50:17] the Bible says from the days of John the
[1:50:19] Baptist the kingdom of God suffered
[1:50:21] violence and the violence tuckered by
[1:50:24] force
[1:50:25] the promise is ours
[1:50:27] but don't think that you're going to
[1:50:29] unfold your arms sit on the fence and
[1:50:32] expect us to happen you have to be in
[1:50:34] the arena
[1:50:35] you have to fight your way out
[1:50:39] praise be to God
[1:50:40] never thought
[1:50:42] they fought to entrain themselves
[1:50:45] and guess what
[1:50:47] after fighting for the land
[1:50:49] they still have to fight
[1:50:52] to keep the land
[1:50:56] after today
[1:50:58] Israel is still fighting every day
[1:51:01] every single day
[1:51:03] when you look at the map of Israel on
[1:51:07] all the land portions they are
[1:51:09] surrounded by five Arab Nations
[1:51:12] and on the west
[1:51:13] is the Mediterranean Sea
[1:51:17] and those Nations that are surrounding
[1:51:19] them are not friends they are enemies
[1:51:22] they are fighting every single day to
[1:51:25] keep that land
[1:51:28] they don't go to bed and close to eyes
[1:51:31] they'll go to bed with one eye open
[1:51:35] that is why they are still on that land
[1:51:38] they are on their legs
[1:51:42] they are under alerts they are far above
[1:51:46] their enemies
[1:51:48] and they are always on the watch
[1:51:53] there are days that the Hezbollah and
[1:51:56] the the what is the other group he's
[1:51:58] bullying um
[1:52:01] yes
[1:52:02] they can fly over a thousand rockers in
[1:52:05] one day over a thousand Rockets into the
[1:52:08] land of Israel
[1:52:09] and when they fly it oh the Iron Dome
[1:52:12] will do to meet it in the air
[1:52:15] and destroy it it has a 98 success rate
[1:52:20] that all those iron domes I mean all
[1:52:23] those misses they send across
[1:52:26] to meet it in the end destroy
[1:52:29] destroy every day
[1:52:30] they are fighting to keep that land
[1:52:33] praise be to God
[1:52:36] has not brought it out of that life of
[1:52:38] Darkness
[1:52:40] out of that life of evil out of that
[1:52:42] life of sin
[1:52:44] God has not brought it from through
[1:52:47] justification only to leave us there no
[1:52:50] no
[1:52:51] he goes forward with us
[1:52:54] true sanctification
[1:52:56] and God would not bring you through
[1:52:58] sanctification and just leave you there
[1:53:01] no you must go forward to get the Holy
[1:53:04] Ghost baptism
[1:53:06] we are not a foolish virgin
[1:53:09] as a matter of fact the foolish virgin
[1:53:12] doesn't even know that she's a foolish
[1:53:14] virgin
[1:53:16] to whom much is given much shall be
[1:53:19] required
[1:53:22] don't deceive yourself
[1:53:24] that if you don't make it oh you are
[1:53:26] going to be a foolish virgin no you know
[1:53:28] better than that
[1:53:30] you know better than that to be a
[1:53:32] foolish virgin
[1:53:36] we have a line of inheritance
[1:53:40] bird did not bring them out of captivity
[1:53:42] only to leave them before the Jordan he
[1:53:44] took them across for them to inherit
[1:53:47] their blessing
[1:53:49] and God will not bring you out of
[1:53:51] justification you go to certification
[1:53:53] and God leaves you there no we have a
[1:53:56] promise
[1:53:57] God has given us a promise the promise
[1:54:00] of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:02] and you have to get the Holy Ghost
[1:54:06] baptism
[1:54:08] their promise is ours
[1:54:12] praise be to God
[1:54:14] don't come to church and then you look
[1:54:17] at some people and think that they are
[1:54:19] so special and that the Holy Ghost is
[1:54:22] just meant for this class of people and
[1:54:23] I am out no
[1:54:28] we all have a demon in our life we are
[1:54:31] fighting
[1:54:33] don't think that somebody else is a
[1:54:36] Superman there is no a Superman in the
[1:54:38] house of God
[1:54:40] the only Superman is Christ
[1:54:42] be to God
[1:54:44] one time my wife had a job somewhere in
[1:54:47] uh Burnsville I've forgotten where we're
[1:54:50] living at the time
[1:54:52] I have always been an Uber driver even
[1:54:54] before Uber came I was a Uber driver
[1:54:57] so I picked her up
[1:55:01] um I was carrying her to work
[1:55:04] uh somewhere
[1:55:07] even when I wanted the first day I knew
[1:55:09] she was not going to last on the job
[1:55:12] because I was not ready to go there the
[1:55:14] second time
[1:55:15] it was too far
[1:55:17] praise be to God
[1:55:19] so when we're going
[1:55:21] there was a church I have forgotten
[1:55:24] whether it was a Lutheran Church
[1:55:28] that was a church
[1:55:31] and there was a writing in front there
[1:55:34] and the writing ah it's a long time
[1:55:37] probably 10 nine years I don't remember
[1:55:39] and it's red
[1:55:43] that Sinners are welcome here
[1:55:47] if you are righteous there is no place
[1:55:49] for you here
[1:55:54] and it just stuck with me
[1:55:57] it just stuck with me
[1:56:01] that Sinners are welcomed here
[1:56:04] if you are righteous there's no place
[1:56:06] for you here
[1:56:08] it is not a pass
[1:56:11] for you to go and do evil
[1:56:13] it is not a pass
[1:56:16] for you to walk out and go and live in
[1:56:18] sin
[1:56:19] because Sinners are welcome here what
[1:56:21] you know to be the right thing that is
[1:56:23] what you ought you ought to do if you
[1:56:25] know something is wrong you stay away
[1:56:27] from it
[1:56:29] if you take advantage of a statement
[1:56:32] like that and then you can go out and
[1:56:34] live in sin or live in error it shows
[1:56:37] the type of seed that is in you
[1:56:40] it shows he didn't even believe to begin
[1:56:42] with
[1:56:48] when you go to the hospital
[1:56:50] you go because you are sick
[1:56:53] you don't go there on Excursion
[1:56:56] our sightseeing
[1:56:59] we come to the house of God
[1:57:03] because
[1:57:05] we are coming to examine ourselves
[1:57:08] coming to hear the word of God
[1:57:12] you don't know
[1:57:13] sitting under the anointing of the Holy
[1:57:16] Spirit
[1:57:17] and here in the word of God
[1:57:19] you're so feeding on the word
[1:57:22] sometimes we underestimate what God is
[1:57:25] doing in our lives
[1:57:30] the chains are broken
[1:57:33] habits
[1:57:35] are destroyed
[1:57:37] use it on a sickness leave
[1:57:42] as I've said before it's not only one
[1:57:44] they pray for you
[1:57:47] but when you sit down and you are here
[1:57:50] in the word of God feeding on the word
[1:57:53] habits leave
[1:57:56] sickness is leaf
[1:57:58] demons vanish
[1:58:01] just sitting down
[1:58:05] sometimes we see it as a sacrifice when
[1:58:07] we are coming to the house of God
[1:58:11] we should see it more as a blessing
[1:58:15] see it more as a blessing
[1:58:18] does something in your life can just
[1:58:21] pick you up
[1:58:22] wake you up in the morning
[1:58:25] when something is saying no you are too
[1:58:27] tired
[1:58:28] just enjoy your sleep
[1:58:30] something in Utah you know
[1:58:33] we are going to the house of the Lord
[1:58:34] today
[1:58:36] you should count it a blessing
[1:58:39] because not very many people
[1:58:42] have experienced that
[1:58:46] praise be to God
[1:58:48] a parallel
[1:58:50] looking at how God deals with the
[1:58:52] children of Israel taking them out of
[1:58:55] captivity to their Promised Land
[1:58:57] and superimposing on so by opposing that
[1:59:01] unto what God has done in our lives
[1:59:05] taking us out of captivity
[1:59:08] bringing us through justification
[1:59:09] through sanctification and into the
[1:59:13] promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:18] and you should know by now as I've
[1:59:21] already said
[1:59:22] that when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:59:25] it doesn't mean that the barrel ends
[1:59:29] there
[1:59:30] the Holy Ghost comes straight into the
[1:59:33] soul
[1:59:35] now when the Holy Ghost comes into the
[1:59:37] soul
[1:59:39] guess what
[1:59:42] the Holy Ghost is surrounded
[1:59:44] by the Flesh on every side
[1:59:46] [Music]
[1:59:51] and as your spirit man surrounds the
[1:59:54] Holy Ghost your soul
[1:59:56] and this is square
[2:00:00] in the greatest battle forts
[2:00:03] the brother brother I'm talking about
[2:00:04] the Mind battles
[2:00:07] the Devil Comes
[2:00:08] and he goes through
[2:00:10] the five senses of your spirit
[2:00:13] he just goes through your imagination
[2:00:15] your sense of imagination boom and then
[2:00:18] you are sitting here and you are 10 000
[2:00:20] miles away and then your mind is
[2:00:22] wandering somewhere
[2:00:24] and then before you're aware you're
[2:00:26] already out of service
[2:00:27] and you are thinking of things you
[2:00:29] shouldn't think about things that will
[2:00:31] wear you out things that will destroy
[2:00:33] your life you sit down and you begin to
[2:00:35] imagine things the devil can just enter
[2:00:37] your reasoning
[2:00:39] and then just come against you can enter
[2:00:42] through your memory through your
[2:00:43] affection
[2:00:44] through the five senses of the spirit
[2:00:47] what is the devil doing the devil can
[2:00:49] never go in there to unseat God but the
[2:00:52] devil is trying to create a confidence
[2:00:54] problem where you would lose confidence
[2:00:57] in the word of God and just turn away
[2:00:59] from the word now the devil has the
[2:01:02] control to come in and possess you
[2:01:05] but you know what
[2:01:07] keep moving forward
[2:01:11] ever
[2:01:13] backward never
[2:01:16] God has not brought us this far
[2:01:19] only to leave us alone
[2:01:22] and we have not come this far
[2:01:24] only to turn back
[2:01:29] I pray God
[2:01:31] that he brings us to that point
[2:01:34] that word would have to choose between
[2:01:36] the word of God and between in our lives
[2:01:39] that we shall choose the word
[2:01:43] for me to live is Christ
[2:01:45] and to die is again
[2:01:48] praise be to God
[2:01:50] that if we have to choose
[2:01:53] between the word of God
[2:01:56] and our lives
[2:01:58] we shall choose God
[2:02:01] like three children in our bed no go
[2:02:05] they said King who will not even give
[2:02:08] this a second thought
[2:02:10] we know our Lord will Deliver Us
[2:02:13] and if he chooses not to who will not
[2:02:16] bow
[2:02:18] praise be to God if he chooses not to We
[2:02:22] Will Not Bow
[2:02:26] if you have to choose
[2:02:28] between the word and you
[2:02:32] choose choose the word
[2:02:36] we have lived too much for ourselves
[2:02:42] it's time to live for God
[2:02:46] praise be to God
[2:02:51] a parallel
[2:02:55] when the Holy Ghost has come in
[2:02:57] remember
[2:02:59] that the battle doesn't end there
[2:03:02] the barrel still continues unabated
[2:03:05] because your soul
[2:03:07] is surrounded by your spirit man
[2:03:10] surrounded by the flesh
[2:03:13] and the devil just comes in
[2:03:15] and now you have a battle going on in
[2:03:19] your mind
[2:03:20] the greatest Barrel ever fought
[2:03:22] but so long as you don't accept it here
[2:03:25] it can never find its way down here
[2:03:32] you have to fight every single day
[2:03:36] to stay in the will of God
[2:03:39] every single day
[2:03:41] when you get up in the morning
[2:03:44] and you don't get your battle you don't
[2:03:46] see your battle as the Lord
[2:03:48] is it where is it
[2:03:52] where is it
[2:03:54] send the devil my way
[2:03:56] it's a difficult thing right A lot of
[2:03:58] times we ask God take the devil away
[2:04:00] take the devil away take the devil away
[2:04:04] they should take it away
[2:04:08] praise the Lord
[2:04:12] don't ask God to take your devil away
[2:04:18] the devil is here to work for God
[2:04:21] sure oh yeah
[2:04:23] I like the way you put it when the Devil
[2:04:26] Comes
[2:04:27] it's a time for God to promote you
[2:04:33] you don't just get up from one program
[2:04:36] you enter another program just sleeping
[2:04:38] no you have to justify yourself
[2:04:44] when the travel is coming
[2:04:46] he knows he's coming for a bloody nose
[2:04:49] and then he comes anyhow because God is
[2:04:52] ready
[2:04:53] to bring you up
[2:04:56] never ask God to take the devil away ask
[2:04:58] God to give you Grace
[2:05:00] to overcome the devil
[2:05:03] praise be to God the parable
[2:05:06] parallel
[2:05:12] I'm very mindful of the time I will not
[2:05:14] keep you here longer than I should
[2:05:17] um praise be to God
[2:05:19] um
[2:05:34] thank you
[2:05:36] we should be out of here by 1 30 it's
[2:05:39] not a promise though
[2:05:40] the praise be to God but I'll keep that
[2:05:43] in mind
[2:05:44] yes so
[2:05:47] brother Brown says
[2:05:49] that without a holy ghost your soul is
[2:05:52] lost
[2:06:02] you know let me just skip
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:07] um
[2:06:10] okay
[2:06:17] okay so the only way to be on the alerts
[2:06:20] is to stay in prayer
[2:06:24] like I was just using that example that
[2:06:26] the children of Israel I only elect
[2:06:29] they don't sleep with their two eyes
[2:06:31] closed
[2:06:32] the only way
[2:06:34] to stay on the alert
[2:06:37] is to be in constant prayer
[2:06:40] that's why the Bible says that pray with
[2:06:42] that season
[2:06:44] God gave us the best weapon
[2:06:47] the best weapon that a child of God
[2:06:50] could ever have over the enemy God gave
[2:06:52] it to us
[2:06:54] but it kind of looks so simple
[2:06:58] so simple
[2:07:00] that sometimes we hardly even believe it
[2:07:02] that you can go on your knees and you
[2:07:05] meet prayer with you mean business with
[2:07:07] God and things will change
[2:07:12] there is power in prayer
[2:07:14] and as I said one time
[2:07:16] that during the prayer series something
[2:07:18] jumped out at me that there is no
[2:07:21] special time for prayer
[2:07:23] that every prayer time is a special time
[2:07:27] it doesn't matter what you have behind
[2:07:28] the steering wheel
[2:07:30] it doesn't matter whether you're at home
[2:07:32] it doesn't matter whether you're on your
[2:07:33] knees it doesn't matter what
[2:07:36] just be sincere enough there isn't
[2:07:39] enough sincerity
[2:07:44] we forget that we are dealing with a god
[2:07:47] who sees us from the inside who we truly
[2:07:51] are
[2:07:53] there isn't enough sincerity
[2:07:56] and because of that
[2:07:58] we don't see much of God
[2:08:03] the only way to be on the alert
[2:08:06] is my prayer
[2:08:08] and keep yourself in the word
[2:08:11] at all times
[2:08:13] praise be to God
[2:08:17] pray without season
[2:08:19] pray in and out of season
[2:08:22] and it's very difficult a lot of the
[2:08:25] times
[2:08:26] that when people are out of season
[2:08:28] when things have happened
[2:08:30] when your heart is broken
[2:08:33] when you are shattered when you are
[2:08:35] going through the storm you hardly find
[2:08:37] strength
[2:08:39] to go before the Lord
[2:08:42] and brothers presence is this
[2:08:45] this is where we ought to be praying for
[2:08:47] one another
[2:08:49] intercessory prayer
[2:08:51] is a very good thing to do
[2:08:55] intercessory prayer a lot of the times
[2:08:58] it's just me me me my family my family
[2:09:01] my family I I am
[2:09:06] pray and ask God
[2:09:08] to put a burden on your heart for
[2:09:10] somebody else
[2:09:13] you may never know
[2:09:16] what somebody else is going through
[2:09:19] we are here to Bear one another's
[2:09:22] infirmities
[2:09:24] the Bible says that let he that is
[2:09:27] strong bear the infirmities of the weak
[2:09:30] [Music]
[2:09:31] not to chastise them
[2:09:33] not to bring them down not to make them
[2:09:35] feel less human
[2:09:36] not to make them feel useless bear their
[2:09:39] infirmities
[2:09:40] be a shoulder
[2:09:43] a shoulder they can cry oh yeah
[2:09:46] praise Beauty God
[2:09:53] praise the Lord
[2:10:05] so the Holy Spirit would testify
[2:10:09] of a would not testify anything other
[2:10:12] than the word
[2:10:15] and brother Abraham says that assures
[2:10:18] evidence that a man has the Holy Ghost
[2:10:22] as living by every word
[2:10:26] living by every word not some not some
[2:10:31] of the word but living by every word
[2:10:34] that is the surest sign that you have
[2:10:38] the Holy Ghost baptism
[2:10:40] we are not against speaking in tongues
[2:10:43] we are not against all those we are not
[2:10:46] against that
[2:10:48] but there are people that speak in
[2:10:50] tongues interpret tongues Miracle
[2:10:53] science and wonders and yet they don't
[2:10:56] have the Holy Ghost
[2:10:58] that is not a sign that you have the
[2:11:01] Holy Ghost baptism
[2:11:03] the surest sign
[2:11:05] that you have the Holy ghosts
[2:11:10] of God why
[2:11:11] because the Holy Ghost
[2:11:13] would never turn himself against his own
[2:11:17] word
[2:11:19] they will never
[2:11:21] the Holy Ghost will never tell him he
[2:11:24] sat back on his own word it's it's
[2:11:27] impossible
[2:11:28] it can never happen
[2:11:31] not in this life not in the Life to Come
[2:11:35] if you want to know you surely have the
[2:11:37] Holy Ghost
[2:11:38] you believe in every word
[2:11:42] I remember talking to a guy at work one
[2:11:45] time he said he was he didn't say is he
[2:11:49] said he was an associate uh minister
[2:11:55] ah Baptist no not Baptist
[2:11:59] he was an associate pastor in a church
[2:12:03] and I was happy meeting him because at
[2:12:06] work it's difficult to get somebody to
[2:12:08] talk about church
[2:12:11] the people are okay when you're talking
[2:12:13] about stupid things
[2:12:14] but if it has to do with the word of God
[2:12:16] they have a problem with it so when you
[2:12:19] test somebody
[2:12:20] that says they believe in the word it's
[2:12:23] just a source of encouragement that you
[2:12:25] are for I have met my brother
[2:12:27] we can talk about God
[2:12:29] I met his brother and then we started
[2:12:31] talking
[2:12:32] and I wanna when I bring a scripture he
[2:12:36] will take it and run with it I bring a
[2:12:38] scripture take it around with it and
[2:12:41] then we're just going going
[2:12:44] sometimes I ask him so you say you were
[2:12:46] you were a pastor what happened I said
[2:12:48] no we just started this conversation let
[2:12:51] me know go too quick before I lose this
[2:12:53] friend
[2:12:54] so we've got to a point and then he
[2:12:58] asked so what do you believe
[2:13:01] then I started sharing with him I asked
[2:13:03] him I said did he ever hear of that
[2:13:05] prophet of God brother Branham
[2:13:07] he said no I said it's amazing
[2:13:10] he was an American
[2:13:12] but a lot of us Africans knew more about
[2:13:15] him than the Americans
[2:13:18] and then I started
[2:13:21] then he was kind of confused a little
[2:13:24] so I started to Atwater baptism
[2:13:28] and then that was why the problem came
[2:13:33] he didn't understand
[2:13:35] I couldn't get him to understand the
[2:13:38] baptism was in the name of Father's son
[2:13:41] Holy Ghost he was holding on to the
[2:13:43] titles and I tried to get you to
[2:13:45] understand and I told him that baptism
[2:13:48] in the title is a wrong baptism if you
[2:13:50] were ever baptizing the titles you have
[2:13:52] to go and baptize again so this guy now
[2:13:54] just went back into his shelves
[2:13:58] sure
[2:13:59] and I didn't know I lost him
[2:14:03] until we met the following week I saw
[2:14:07] him coming and I said to myself oh my
[2:14:09] brother's coming and I was smiling I
[2:14:12] call him his face was
[2:14:16] I said oh it's time to back off
[2:14:20] and I stayed a safe distance
[2:14:23] because at work
[2:14:25] you know these people as I said oh he's
[2:14:28] harassing me with the word of God it's
[2:14:30] something that can happen praise be to
[2:14:33] God
[2:14:34] this is somebody that was an associate
[2:14:36] pastor
[2:14:37] that probably may have baptized people
[2:14:40] in the title of father son Holy Ghost
[2:14:42] now you hear the word of God
[2:14:45] and you know it is the truth
[2:14:48] and yet you can't take it
[2:14:50] but they will tell you that they have
[2:14:52] the Holy Ghost baptism
[2:14:54] maybe they have a ghost of a thought
[2:14:57] but one thing
[2:14:59] we do know
[2:15:01] that God
[2:15:03] would never tell him himself against his
[2:15:06] word
[2:15:07] the Holy Ghost
[2:15:09] would say nothing but the word of God
[2:15:14] and if you want to know you truly have
[2:15:16] the Holy Ghost baptism you believe in
[2:15:18] every word of God
[2:15:20] praise be to God
[2:15:22] you have no problem
[2:15:25] you may have some difficult areas in
[2:15:27] your life
[2:15:28] that you will get to a point
[2:15:30] and the way you are seeing things are
[2:15:32] different and somebody comes and tells
[2:15:34] you brother you got this wrong he said
[2:15:36] no I never got it from he said come this
[2:15:38] is what the Bible says or this is what
[2:15:40] the prophet says oh I'm sorry
[2:15:42] I didn't know it was this I never saw it
[2:15:45] that way
[2:15:46] and what do you do you go before the
[2:15:48] Lord in prayer father forgive me I
[2:15:51] didn't know I'm sorry
[2:15:53] but not to not not to condemn or Rise
[2:15:57] Against the word no that means that it's
[2:15:59] a problem in your life
[2:16:02] praise be to God
[2:16:04] yes
[2:16:06] Clark says I'm left in 15 minutes
[2:16:10] praise be to God so the Holy Ghost would
[2:16:14] never deny the word of God
[2:16:16] and the Bible says that grave nuts
[2:16:20] the Holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed
[2:16:23] unto the day of your Redemption on a day
[2:16:25] of your Redemption now reading from the
[2:16:28] prophet why did I take this from
[2:16:31] um
[2:16:34] well let's read
[2:16:37] now the Holy Spirit
[2:16:39] is the seal
[2:16:41] now if you say you believe and haven't
[2:16:44] received the Holy Ghost then God's has
[2:16:48] never recognized your faith yet
[2:16:50] because the seal is a recognition that
[2:16:55] God has completed and finished his work
[2:16:58] in you
[2:16:59] praise be to God
[2:17:01] that he recognized sure
[2:17:04] someone said why should you make it so
[2:17:08] loose Branham
[2:17:10] Saint John 5 24 that's the beginning of
[2:17:12] the spirit
[2:17:13] that's right I believe that amen that a
[2:17:17] man as soon as you believe on the Lord
[2:17:20] Jesus Christ
[2:17:21] is a portion
[2:17:24] of the Holy Spirit
[2:17:28] when you are sanctified
[2:17:30] another portion of the Holy Spirit
[2:17:33] cleanses you
[2:17:35] then you are filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:17:40] praise be to God
[2:17:42] now talking about the seal
[2:17:44] of a finished work
[2:17:48] is just like I mean those of you who
[2:17:50] have waited in factory settings or
[2:17:51] whatever
[2:17:53] before a company puts his seal on
[2:17:56] anything
[2:17:57] it signifies a completed work
[2:18:02] they got their raw materials
[2:18:05] they refine it
[2:18:06] they'll go through the production system
[2:18:09] they have a quality Wing that comes and
[2:18:11] in space and make sure everything is why
[2:18:13] it's supposed to be
[2:18:15] and then they'll put the company's seal
[2:18:18] on it
[2:18:19] is showing a finished work
[2:18:24] so when you have the Holy Ghost is God
[2:18:27] put in his seal on you that you are a
[2:18:31] finished work
[2:18:34] you are finished work
[2:18:38] praise be to God
[2:18:40] now when the company pulls that work
[2:18:44] or that material or that product
[2:18:47] in a semi
[2:18:49] and the summer goes and it involves in
[2:18:52] an accident
[2:18:54] it so doesn't change anything
[2:18:56] the bosses can break
[2:18:59] the product inside can can destroy
[2:19:02] it is still a finished work
[2:19:07] when God has put his seal on you when
[2:19:10] you have the Holy Ghost baptism in your
[2:19:12] soul you are a finished work
[2:19:15] it doesn't matter
[2:19:17] what happens afterward
[2:19:19] in a car crash
[2:19:22] the plane goes up and ends up in the sea
[2:19:26] it doesn't matter what happens
[2:19:28] you are a finished work
[2:19:33] and brother Branham says
[2:19:35] somewhere I don't have it down here that
[2:19:38] without the Holy Ghost baptism you are
[2:19:40] not even a Christian to begin with
[2:19:43] it doesn't mean that God is not working
[2:19:45] in your life
[2:19:47] there are studies God is good God is
[2:19:49] taking you through
[2:19:51] he will surely bring you on to an
[2:19:53] expected end there is no doubt about it
[2:19:55] if you put your trust in God God Will
[2:19:58] Never Let You Down
[2:20:00] do not let your faith in God keep
[2:20:02] wandering
[2:20:04] it doesn't matter what you go through
[2:20:08] knowing who you are as a child of God
[2:20:11] praise be to God
[2:20:13] settles it
[2:20:16] that settless it
[2:20:21] praise be to God I just want to read a
[2:20:23] few things here but I am I I let me stay
[2:20:27] on it I have 10 more minutes to go
[2:20:29] praise be to God
[2:20:32] as soon okay
[2:20:37] third year of my
[2:20:41] life my life there's only one type of it
[2:20:44] that's God's life now we notice that
[2:20:48] Cain he made an altar he put a sacrifice
[2:20:51] on it
[2:20:52] he got down and he confessed his faith
[2:20:55] in God he worshiped God in other words
[2:20:58] just like the religious man the
[2:21:01] religious men today 99 out of 100 almost
[2:21:05] they say here it is
[2:21:09] it is the best I can do
[2:21:11] Ken said this I built an altar I belong
[2:21:16] here to church
[2:21:18] I made a sacrifice this is the best I
[2:21:22] can do take it or leave it
[2:21:28] is that not how we behave sometimes
[2:21:32] you know you have to come by God's
[2:21:36] provided way
[2:21:38] there is a way that he might write unto
[2:21:41] a man by the end is death
[2:21:47] do not lean on your own understanding
[2:21:50] lead on the word of God even where you
[2:21:54] don't understand
[2:21:59] you don't have to understand to live by
[2:22:01] it
[2:22:05] live by it because it is the word of God
[2:22:10] that is the behavior sometimes
[2:22:14] you don't verbalize it
[2:22:16] but by your life that is what you are
[2:22:19] saying this is the best I can do take it
[2:22:22] or leave it
[2:22:24] you must come by God's provided way
[2:22:28] you must come according to the way God
[2:22:31] has ordained it
[2:22:35] if there is anything good coming out
[2:22:38] it must be according to God's provided
[2:22:41] way
[2:22:43] Yahweh would provide nothing
[2:22:45] by Death
[2:22:47] does the attitude of people today I go
[2:22:50] to church I help them do everything we
[2:22:54] build a nice building we we are we're
[2:22:56] done with all this
[2:22:58] we we
[2:23:00] um I put into the widows fund I do all
[2:23:04] this
[2:23:05] there it is the best I can do take it or
[2:23:09] leave it
[2:23:10] God will live it
[2:23:13] he left it there for Cain
[2:23:16] he will leave it there for you
[2:23:19] there is a wider him right onto a man by
[2:23:23] the end thereof
[2:23:25] is the way of death
[2:23:27] there is only one provided word for God
[2:23:30] that is down the bloodstream to the Holy
[2:23:34] Spirit without that you are done
[2:23:38] this is nuts
[2:23:40] to threaten you
[2:23:44] the truth
[2:23:46] a lot of the times
[2:23:49] it's not
[2:23:51] easy to swallow
[2:23:55] and we don't sugarcoat it
[2:23:59] make it look nice
[2:24:01] so you can take it in and feel good no
[2:24:05] but a brother says somewhere
[2:24:09] that he is obligated to tell you the
[2:24:11] truth
[2:24:12] but he is not obligated to what you do
[2:24:17] with the word
[2:24:20] and that is why every preacher ought to
[2:24:22] be
[2:24:24] I'm obligated by the grace of God to
[2:24:27] tell you what I know is the truth of the
[2:24:30] word amen
[2:24:31] whatever you choose to do with it
[2:24:35] is no longer my promise
[2:24:37] even though I would encourage you
[2:24:40] take God at this word
[2:24:43] praise be to God that would be my only
[2:24:47] encouragement to you
[2:24:49] take God by his word
[2:24:52] praise God and the prophet said
[2:24:55] so he started threatening you
[2:24:57] this is just mine not to threaten you
[2:25:01] um
[2:25:04] so uh you will never
[2:25:07] accept a man be born again
[2:25:10] he can in no wise enter into the kingdom
[2:25:13] that's right you must come no matter how
[2:25:16] religious you are what all you do
[2:25:19] that has not one thing to do that makes
[2:25:24] you a pretty good citizen
[2:25:26] but not a citizen of that Kingdom day
[2:25:30] maybe of this Kingdom Here by the
[2:25:33] kingdom of God is within you
[2:25:36] you are born in the Kingdom the kingdom
[2:25:39] comes in
[2:25:41] the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit
[2:25:43] you belong to that Kingdom that's the
[2:25:47] reason women don't bark their hair don't
[2:25:50] wear shorts that's the reason men don't
[2:25:53] smoke cigarettes and think like that
[2:25:57] they are from above their Spirit teaches
[2:26:00] them righteousness holiness
[2:26:03] they don't swear they don't use bad
[2:26:05] language and tense why they are born
[2:26:09] from above they are they are different
[2:26:12] citizens from above and now notice the
[2:26:16] world
[2:26:17] they say well I belong to church and
[2:26:20] what what have you
[2:26:24] children of God do not sway
[2:26:27] children of God
[2:26:29] you're the young ones here
[2:26:32] you go to school
[2:26:33] you hear people even at work people
[2:26:36] cursing Loosely talking Loosely they say
[2:26:39] things
[2:26:42] do not be partakers of other people's
[2:26:45] sin
[2:26:48] children of God don't talk Loosely you
[2:26:51] don't curse you don't swear foreign
[2:27:00] for God did rest on the Sabbath day and
[2:27:04] he said
[2:27:06] as he said in a certain place another
[2:27:08] time uh today after so long a time when
[2:27:12] you hear the voice hiding not your heart
[2:27:15] then if Jesus would have given them
[2:27:18] another Sabbath
[2:27:19] he had
[2:27:21] have afterward spoke of it
[2:27:24] but there remaineth
[2:27:27] a Sabbath
[2:27:29] keeping to the people of God
[2:27:31] for we which have entered into his rest
[2:27:35] have ceased from our works like God did
[2:27:40] from his
[2:27:42] you'll get to that point life is no
[2:27:45] longer about you
[2:27:49] you think of God more than you think
[2:27:51] about yourself
[2:27:53] you've had enough of you hmm sure you
[2:27:57] just want to please God in everything
[2:28:01] you want God to be in your life
[2:28:05] when you take a step you you want to see
[2:28:08] God taking a step with you
[2:28:10] you are sure of his presence
[2:28:13] praise be to God
[2:28:15] when we do enter into his rest okay
[2:28:19] um now he says he says now you with
[2:28:22] pencils turn with me to Isaiah 28 8-12
[2:28:26] you can read that later here's where you
[2:28:29] get it
[2:28:30] precepts must be upon precepts lying
[2:28:34] upon line
[2:28:36] here a little there a little hold fast
[2:28:40] to that which is good for with
[2:28:43] stammering lives and with other tongues
[2:28:46] will I speak to my people
[2:28:48] and this is the Sabbath
[2:28:50] this is the risk that I said would come
[2:28:55] and for all this they would not
[2:28:59] work away work in their heads and so
[2:29:02] forth he said that the seal
[2:29:06] of the finished
[2:29:09] of salvation
[2:29:11] through justification uh Lutheran
[2:29:15] justification Wesley sanctification but
[2:29:18] when the Sabbath come the real rest day
[2:29:22] it will be when stamron lives and other
[2:29:26] tanks will I speak to the people to
[2:29:28] these people and this is the finished
[2:29:31] work
[2:29:32] this is the seal this is the Sabbath
[2:29:36] don't you see it is the Holy Ghost
[2:29:38] brother
[2:29:39] that is when you enter into the finished
[2:29:42] work
[2:29:43] if you've just been Justified that's all
[2:29:47] right
[2:29:47] that's good
[2:29:49] if you've been Sanctified that's good
[2:29:52] but when you receive the Holy Ghost it's
[2:29:55] a finished work
[2:29:57] and God have completed his Plan of
[2:30:00] Salvation and sealed it with the baptism
[2:30:03] of the Holy Ghost amen
[2:30:06] praise be to God
[2:30:09] now holy ghost baptism is a promise to
[2:30:11] the children of God
[2:30:12] that in the lives that you pour out his
[2:30:14] Spirit upon All Flesh it's a promise
[2:30:19] and keep remembering
[2:30:21] remind yourself
[2:30:23] I don't know why this cup keeps coming
[2:30:25] over and over our time is off
[2:30:28] that if you were to see the salvation of
[2:30:31] the Lord
[2:30:32] keep marching forward
[2:30:35] when you look at
[2:30:38] the
[2:30:40] the Bible says that will wrestle not
[2:30:43] against flesh and blood
[2:30:45] but against principalities
[2:30:48] rulers of this Dark World evil spirits
[2:30:51] forces of Darkness right
[2:30:53] and the Bible goes on to say
[2:30:56] that put on the whole armor of God
[2:31:00] put on the whole armor of God
[2:31:08] now when you look at the armor of God
[2:31:13] I'm not going in that step but you have
[2:31:16] a helmet or salvation
[2:31:19] you have a breastplate of righteousness
[2:31:21] and the Bible says get your lines
[2:31:25] with the truth
[2:31:27] and your feet shut
[2:31:29] in the prepression of the gospel of
[2:31:31] peace and you have in your hand
[2:31:34] The Shield of faith and the sword of the
[2:31:36] spirit
[2:31:37] so when you look at it
[2:31:40] so long as you are Marching forward you
[2:31:43] are protected
[2:31:44] because from the head right down to your
[2:31:47] feet you are protected
[2:31:51] back on your back
[2:31:52] when you tend to run away
[2:31:55] the devil takes you
[2:32:02] never put your hand to the plow
[2:32:05] and turn back
[2:32:08] you become a feast for the devil
[2:32:12] so long as you keep marching forward
[2:32:15] you are victorious
[2:32:18] marching forward
[2:32:27] forward pray with us easy keep matching
[2:32:29] forward
[2:32:30] be led by the Holy Spirit keep marching
[2:32:34] forward
[2:32:41] anywhere you find yourself we are two
[2:32:43] minutes above time
[2:32:45] praise be to God
[2:32:51] um I think normally we even leave you
[2:32:52] around too
[2:32:59] yeah I will leave you around you
[2:33:01] praise be to God no I'm not good I'm
[2:33:04] still going to stay with my time I'm
[2:33:05] just going to borrow a little time
[2:33:06] praise be to go yes
[2:33:09] so um
[2:33:14] okay so in closing
[2:33:17] the musicians can come over that means
[2:33:18] that I'm serious praise be to God
[2:33:22] yeah
[2:33:24] so the Bible says here in John 17 17
[2:33:28] power against unclean spirits
[2:33:32] again
[2:33:33] we are given power over unclean spirits
[2:33:38] praise be to God
[2:33:41] now whatever condition you find
[2:33:43] yourselves in
[2:33:45] you are not supposed to just sit down
[2:33:47] and accept it
[2:33:50] don't sit down and accept it
[2:33:52] you are a fighter
[2:33:55] you are a fighter
[2:33:57] we said the Devil is a fighter yes he is
[2:34:00] May you are a fighter
[2:34:04] the devil can never overcome a child of
[2:34:06] God
[2:34:09] praise be to God
[2:34:11] [Music]
[2:34:13] you commit the devil 32.
[2:34:17] don't surrender your grounds
[2:34:20] don't surrender your grounds
[2:34:24] if you have to die
[2:34:26] so be it
[2:34:28] but if you have to die die as a child of
[2:34:31] God
[2:34:36] we don't smoke peace pipe with the Devil
[2:34:42] praise be to God
[2:34:44] they went out and called The Devils and
[2:34:47] they came back rejoice in the combat
[2:34:49] rejoicing and said don't Rejoice Jesus
[2:34:52] telling them because you cast out devils
[2:34:55] and they are subject to you but Rejoice
[2:34:58] that your nails written in heaven
[2:35:01] praise be to God
[2:35:03] we are Heavenly Creatures
[2:35:05] we don't belong here
[2:35:07] [Music]
[2:35:08] any spirit that tells you that Lord you
[2:35:11] are bound to this earth is the spirit of
[2:35:12] the devil
[2:35:14] we are not bound here
[2:35:18] we are children of God we come from
[2:35:21] heaven and we go back to heaven
[2:35:25] there is no doubt Know Who You Are
[2:35:30] Know Who You Are
[2:35:31] what you go through
[2:35:34] the things you go through do not define
[2:35:36] you
[2:35:38] they don't Define you
[2:35:42] they should be in your real View Mirror
[2:35:45] by now
[2:35:46] [Music]
[2:35:47] and keep matching forward
[2:35:49] [Music]
[2:35:51] God is going to bring us all to an
[2:35:53] expected end
[2:35:57] the children of Israel inherited their
[2:35:59] promise
[2:36:00] [Music]
[2:36:02] God is never going to leave you
[2:36:06] or abandon you he has promised I'll be
[2:36:09] with you always
[2:36:11] and he has kept his word
[2:36:15] the Bible says that we are already
[2:36:17] seated in Heavenly places
[2:36:19] through Christ Jesus
[2:36:23] we are
[2:36:24] we are
[2:36:28] it's just a matter of time
[2:36:30] and will defy gravity it's just a matter
[2:36:34] of time
[2:36:35] foreign
[2:36:38] Spirits are we baptized into one body
[2:36:45] struggle
[2:36:48] to enter in the day
[2:36:50] that is why the blessings are
[2:36:55] strive to go in there
[2:36:59] don't take any excuse stay in behind
[2:37:05] we are already
[2:37:07] seated in Heavenly places
[2:37:10] through Christ Jesus
[2:37:12] there is Joyce that your names are
[2:37:13] written in heaven
[2:37:20] I want to ask you something the prophet
[2:37:22] is asking my brother if your names
[2:37:26] if your name is written in heaven
[2:37:29] okay the mark of the beast and the Seal
[2:37:31] of God
[2:37:33] um number number two
[2:37:36] I think paragraph eight and I'm not sure
[2:37:38] does that still do it
[2:37:41] it's have no sign
[2:37:44] no indeed
[2:37:46] Judas was right with them
[2:37:49] Judas was just as big a duck in the
[2:37:53] puddle as the rest of them was
[2:37:57] he came right along through
[2:37:59] justification went out through
[2:38:02] sanctification
[2:38:04] prayed for the sick had great results
[2:38:07] but when it come to Pentecost he showed
[2:38:11] his colors
[2:38:13] and that's exactly what a denominational
[2:38:16] churches has done today
[2:38:19] they've come through justification
[2:38:22] sanctification but when it comes to the
[2:38:25] Holy Ghost when it comes to the baptism
[2:38:26] of the Holy Ghost that bunch of tongues
[2:38:30] and signs and wonders and angers
[2:38:34] appearing and so forth they don't want
[2:38:37] nothing to do with it
[2:38:42] so the so that's where is so close
[2:38:46] together
[2:38:48] it had deceived the very elect if
[2:38:51] possible
[2:38:55] so what are we talking about this
[2:38:56] morning
[2:38:58] or we close in two minutes
[2:39:02] this message was just meant
[2:39:08] to bring us onto our inheritance
[2:39:12] which the father himself gives it
[2:39:15] doesn't come from any man it doesn't
[2:39:17] come from the church
[2:39:20] it doesn't come from anybody
[2:39:25] it's a promise that God himself has made
[2:39:28] to the
[2:39:31] to bring us to know and assess
[2:39:35] where we are in our journey with God
[2:39:39] that you can look at your life and ask
[2:39:41] yourself where am I
[2:39:44] where am I in my walk with God
[2:39:48] where am I because God knows where you
[2:39:51] are
[2:39:53] no brother knows no sister knows but you
[2:39:57] know where you are
[2:40:00] it's not a time to God before God and
[2:40:03] try to sugarcoat your language no it's
[2:40:05] not a time for grammar
[2:40:07] just go to God and speak to God
[2:40:11] Just As You Are
[2:40:14] Just As You Are
[2:40:17] praise be to God
[2:40:20] and the Bible said will she work out our
[2:40:23] our salvation with fear and trembling
[2:40:27] this is not a time to relax
[2:40:30] and always remember that The Closer you
[2:40:33] get the harder it becomes
[2:40:36] the closer you get the harder it becomes
[2:40:39] don't expect it to be easy
[2:40:43] if it becomes easy praise God for it but
[2:40:46] don't expect it the closer you get the
[2:40:49] harder it comes something must take us
[2:40:51] out of here
[2:40:53] it's like somebody an athlete an athlete
[2:40:57] maybe you are running um any race at all
[2:41:00] let's take it maybe 800 meters
[2:41:03] you go through the field two times
[2:41:05] when you are getting to the middle Zone
[2:41:10] that is when it gets harder
[2:41:12] that is when people are falling back and
[2:41:15] that is why people persevere they are
[2:41:19] tired but they don't give up
[2:41:21] that failure giving up but they don't
[2:41:22] give up they are looking at the
[2:41:25] Finishing Line and they keep pressing on
[2:41:27] till the cross they never stop
[2:41:29] because of Christ they never rests
[2:41:32] so the closer you are getting to the
[2:41:34] Finishing Line the harder it becomes but
[2:41:38] that is where you ought to persevere
[2:41:42] that is not a time to throw in the towel
[2:41:44] that is the time to persevere
[2:41:46] prayers be to God so remember that The
[2:41:50] Closer you get the harder is going to be
[2:41:52] or the harder is going to become but
[2:41:55] it's designed to be that way
[2:41:57] praise be to God
[2:42:01] it's now going to get soft okay
[2:42:05] so again
[2:42:08] let us all pray
[2:42:11] that we are not left in the wilderness
[2:42:15] as you keep your eyes on the promise
[2:42:19] keep in constant prayer
[2:42:22] and always let the word be in your
[2:42:25] hearts
[2:42:27] in your heart
[2:42:31] anything you treasure entertain your
[2:42:34] treasure
[2:42:35] foreign
[2:42:38] [Music]
[2:42:46] as you keep a constant prayer
[2:42:50] keep the word in your heart
[2:42:52] as you are being led
[2:42:55] by the Holy Spirit into every promise of
[2:42:58] God
[2:43:01] and this brings us
[2:43:04] right down
[2:43:06] so that three sacred virtues of the
[2:43:08] church
[2:43:09] Brian talks about which brother one has
[2:43:12] been preaching about for some time
[2:43:14] prayer
[2:43:16] the word and the Holy Ghost
[2:43:21] stay in constant prayer
[2:43:24] stay in constant prayer
[2:43:27] whether you are in season or out of
[2:43:29] season stay in constant prayer
[2:43:32] hide a word in your heart
[2:43:35] treasure it above your personal life
[2:43:39] and let the Holy Spirit be your guide
[2:43:42] and live
[2:43:45] praise be to God
[2:43:48] shall We Stand
[2:43:54] can you put that music there I have
[2:43:56] decided to follow Jesus
[2:44:05] [Music]
[2:44:18] Jesus
[2:44:21] [Music]
[2:44:27] [Applause]
[2:44:31] Christ
[2:44:33] [Music]
[2:44:44] [Applause]
[2:44:47] foreign
[2:44:50] me and me and Rosie for me
[2:44:59] no turning by
[2:45:03] doctor
[2:45:13] [Music]
[2:45:23] foreign
[2:45:24] [Music]
[2:46:00] foreign
[2:46:03] [Applause]
[2:46:04] [Music]
[2:46:30] look at me
[2:46:32] today
[2:46:36] [Music]
[2:46:43] I cross our prairies
[2:46:49] [Music]
[2:46:59] cross out
[2:47:02] no
[2:47:07] [Music]
[2:47:14] as the musicians softly play I want us
[2:47:16] to go before the Lord in prayer
[2:47:20] the Bible says his word will not go out
[2:47:23] and return unto him void
[2:47:26] and it is the word of God and the word
[2:47:28] of God is true
[2:47:34] this is a spiritual battle we are all
[2:47:36] fighting
[2:47:38] I don't know what you're going through
[2:47:43] as a matter of fact one brother one
[2:47:45] asked me to take this service today
[2:47:47] I already heard something on my mind
[2:47:50] but it happened not to be
[2:47:54] and anytime it happens that way I
[2:47:55] believe
[2:47:57] that God has to wait for somebody
[2:48:00] and the word of God would never fall to
[2:48:03] the ground
[2:48:05] you receive the word of God into your
[2:48:08] soul tonight this afternoon I wanted to
[2:48:11] go before the Lord talk to God
[2:48:13] because whenever the word of God comes
