[50:04] and the lord bless you you may have your
[50:06] seat let's just take a few prayer
[50:08] requests here
[50:10] and then
[50:12] we will
[50:16] praise the lord
[50:17] [Music]
[50:24] before we go to the lord and pray
[50:26] we will uh
[50:31] [Music]
[50:35] the the trustees actually there
[50:38] installed the the offering entire box
[50:41] back there
[50:42] that was one of the mentor that we we
[50:45] use uh to be able to
[50:47] uh deal with our returning back to
[50:49] church after the kovac
[50:52] and i realized that many of the saints
[50:56] have gone on to uh online
[50:58] offering entire pain
[51:01] which of course they have brought some
[51:02] sense of discipline to us
[51:05] but we also have to realize that
[51:08] we have
[51:10] we have a young generation we are a
[51:12] young church
[51:13] full of young people and
[51:15] children learn from what they see
[51:18] and
[51:19] i was i've taught about a few times
[51:23] and then i spoke with the deacons
[51:28] and we
[51:29] talked and decided that
[51:31] we will go back to
[51:33] passing the offering bag
[51:35] now if you are if you are uh back if you
[51:39] are into the habit of doing what you are
[51:41] doing is working well for you you feel
[51:43] like you are disciplined that way i mean
[51:46] is is between you and the lord and then
[51:49] that that is good
[51:51] but uh we we always try to be mindful of
[51:55] our young generation uh taking sides
[51:58] with jesus better better emphasize on
[52:00] the end he says whatever we do we have
[52:02] to keep in mind that there's a
[52:04] generation that is coming after us
[52:06] we want to lay the right kind of for
[52:08] example and and encourage them so i told
[52:11] they can't we will we will we will just
[52:14] go back to that
[52:15] and
[52:16] the song leader would call them up and
[52:19] then we would do it and in that way we
[52:22] will have the privilege to teach our
[52:24] children
[52:24] uh uh
[52:26] giving
[52:27] because it's part of our worship
[52:30] when the wise men saw his tide in the
[52:32] east
[52:33] they came to worship him
[52:36] but
[52:37] in honor of their worship they also
[52:39] brought gifts
[52:41] it's not it's not all
[52:43] just about money it's just part of
[52:46] worship
[52:47] so
[52:48] we want to do that to be able to
[52:52] carry our our little children with us
[52:56] just like moses said we don't want to
[52:57] leave anyone behind and then
[53:01] talking about the little children
[53:04] it's been there a long while
[53:06] the same reason also because of the
[53:08] corv8 when we start to
[53:10] redo this place and
[53:13] some renovation and all of that
[53:15] we took away the children's chopper
[53:18] which was our children's sunday school
[53:21] and
[53:22] we've been we've been thinking
[53:25] how to come back how to
[53:27] how to be able to get those young ones
[53:30] how to keep them in fellowship how to
[53:32] teach them i know the parents you have
[53:34] the greater responsibility to teach your
[53:36] children but yet as an assembly
[53:39] we want to
[53:40] also find a way to keep them in
[53:43] fellowship with one another and also
[53:46] with what is done here
[53:48] so
[53:50] we know we don't have the space
[53:52] we don't have the space the back room
[53:54] back there
[53:56] we
[53:58] we rearrange it and try to make it in
[54:00] different way for the mothers and their
[54:03] babies
[54:04] but yet is is stay a multi-purpose room
[54:08] the the musicians go there to pray and
[54:11] prepare themselves before they come up
[54:13] here i think the mothers use the rooms
[54:16] less than than
[54:18] than
[54:18] we are
[54:20] so
[54:21] we were thinking that
[54:23] we will work on the schedule and and see
[54:25] if we can get
[54:27] the kids
[54:29] a saturday or two in a month
[54:32] where they can come down to the church
[54:35] and the sisters that will work with them
[54:37] can be able to have all the time to work
[54:40] with them
[54:41] if it is just one saturday in the month
[54:43] or
[54:43] you know every other saturday we will
[54:45] work with that gradually
[54:48] as we as we try to
[54:50] to
[54:53] work with our little ones
[54:56] if
[54:57] ever if any one of us have had a sunday
[54:59] school day and had a good sunday school
[55:02] teacher we know how important that is
[55:05] and we don't want to despise that
[55:07] so for the by the way of announcement
[55:10] those are the two things so uh beginning
[55:13] the next service the deacons will just
[55:15] come true quickly and uh
[55:19] and then
[55:21] the service will continue right in the
[55:23] midst of the service
[55:26] uh
[55:27] we have a prayer request here the uh
[55:30] sister naomi wrote one
[55:32] and she's asking
[55:35] for prayer for
[55:37] sister nadine
[55:39] there's
[55:40] sister grace i believe there's
[55:44] sister grace
[55:46] mother-in-law and
[55:48] george mother
[55:50] we want to just bring her before the
[55:52] lord this morning
[55:54] and she's in the hospital
[55:58] i think it should be the doctor report
[56:00] she's not expected to live
[56:02] and she's having diabetes complication
[56:06] but we are standing this morning
[56:10] before the giver of life
[56:12] he has the final say
[56:15] he has the last word
[56:17] praise the lord
[56:19] so we're not going to take the doctor
[56:21] report
[56:22] we're going to give it to him
[56:24] praise the lord and we know that he's
[56:26] more than able
[56:28] and as we remember that we will also
[56:30] want to pray
[56:32] uh
[56:33] i think many of us will remember
[56:35] brother frederick he was a young
[56:38] student brother
[56:40] that was that was coming to church
[56:42] here for the y
[56:44] and we were praying for him because he
[56:46] had a heart problem
[56:48] uh
[56:49] in the in the past week
[56:51] brother fredrick went to be with the
[56:53] lord
[56:54] he passed away over in kinshasa
[56:58] and
[56:59] on my way back from the meetings in
[57:01] zimbabwe his brother called me
[57:04] and while i was in amsterdam
[57:06] and told me that he was in a critical
[57:09] condition i went i thought i would talk
[57:11] to him on the phone
[57:12] but the brother couldn't go into the
[57:15] hospital room
[57:16] so i got back home and
[57:19] and tried to help them to get medication
[57:21] and different things
[57:23] but just in the midst of the week
[57:26] he went to be with the lord
[57:29] what would be gracious and encouraging
[57:32] his brother
[57:35] brother hope
[57:37] [Music]
[57:38] had a dream because brother hope was the
[57:41] one that that kind of got in contact
[57:43] with brother frederick
[57:44] uh in the same school and tried to
[57:46] encourage him
[57:48] you know uh uh
[57:50] encourage him to church and all of that
[57:53] so
[57:54] they were friends
[57:56] and so so i will always talk to
[57:58] frederick i mean talk to hope when i'm
[58:01] not hearing from frederick you know he
[58:02] was always concerned
[58:05] but i hope we have a dream the very
[58:07] morning that uh

[1:14:54] local i said did i preach that

[1:15:05] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:15:07] from heaven clothed with a cloud and the
[1:15:09] rainbow
[1:15:10] was upon his head and his face was as it
[1:15:14] were the sun
[1:15:16] and his feet
[1:15:17] as pillow of fire
[1:15:21] and he had in his hands a little broke
[1:15:24] open
[1:15:27] and he set his right foot upon the seed
[1:15:31] and his left foot upon the earth
[1:15:34] and cry with a loud voice
[1:15:38] as when a lion ruleth
[1:15:41] and when he have cried seven thunder
[1:15:45] altered their voices
[1:15:48] father
[1:15:50] we ask your blessing upon the word

[1:16:08] the lord bless you you may have your
[1:16:09] seed georges chapter seven
[1:16:13] we can go back to georges chapter seven
[1:16:15] and bill i was saying
[1:16:18] from the book of george's
[1:16:20] uh
[1:16:21] uh
[1:16:22] chapter seven we notice is talking about
[1:16:25] gideon when gideon
[1:16:27] went into his battle
[1:16:29] is uh
[1:16:31] is is very very amazing you see a lot of
[1:16:34] sense of humor that god plays as you
[1:16:37] read the bible
[1:16:38] you know you you you put yourself in it
[1:16:41] and
[1:16:43] just like you are watching the movie
[1:16:46] and sometimes it can be beautiful
[1:16:48] because there are some scenes that just
[1:16:50] that just kind of
[1:16:52] grab your mind here george's
[1:16:54] in george's chapter seven gideon was
[1:16:57] going into uh
[1:16:59] one of his major battle
[1:17:02] against the mennonite
[1:17:04] praise the lord
[1:17:06] and
[1:17:07] as he as he takes up
[1:17:09] in his battle
[1:17:11] we realize here that he had
[1:17:14] he had uh the
[1:17:17] a lot of men that went out with him
[1:17:21] and uh
[1:17:23] trying to get the right figure here
[1:17:27] some thousand men went out with him and
[1:17:29] god told gideon that the men that have
[1:17:32] gone out with you there
[1:17:34] they are too many
[1:17:36] you know if uh
[1:17:39] if uh
[1:17:43] was about 22 000
[1:17:46] you know
[1:17:47] and uh
[1:17:50] the law said there are too many so
[1:17:52] gideon said
[1:17:54] to the people
[1:17:56] that if you are afraid
[1:17:59] please turn back
[1:18:00] and go
[1:18:02] so
[1:18:03] this huge amount of people
[1:18:05] turn back
[1:18:06] i think they were earnest
[1:18:09] praise the lord
[1:18:10] they were earnest people they turn back
[1:18:12] and go so he was left with ten thousand
[1:18:15] men
[1:18:16] the lord came and told him no gideon ten
[1:18:18] thousand is too much
[1:18:20] you know i'm almighty god
[1:18:23] all power i can use one person
[1:18:25] you know 10 000 is too much so
[1:18:28] i want you to bring the people down to
[1:18:30] the to the to the river
[1:18:32] and uh
[1:18:33] he says if you bring them down to the
[1:18:36] river
[1:18:37] you know
[1:18:38] those that will that will uh you know
[1:18:41] lift the water
[1:18:42] you know uh put in one side those that
[1:18:44] will buy their hairs and drink
[1:18:46] directly from the from the
[1:18:50] from the river you put them one side
[1:18:53] so uh there were three thousand men that
[1:18:56] took the water
[1:18:57] and they leap it you know just uh
[1:19:00] uh like the strip just leave the water
[1:19:02] like dogs
[1:19:04] and there were seven thousand men on the
[1:19:07] other side that by their heads you know
[1:19:09] as i'm as i'm reading this in my mind
[1:19:12] yara said a bunch of thousand people
[1:19:15] have just returned back you know they
[1:19:17] have just gone back about 22 000 people
[1:19:20] have just returned back
[1:19:22] okay
[1:19:23] and ten thousand and what gideon said if
[1:19:26] you are afraid go back so with this ten
[1:19:28] thousand now
[1:19:30] uh
[1:19:31] they said they were not afraid
[1:19:34] so
[1:19:35] god is giving them this option of of
[1:19:37] drinking for them to go across the river
[1:19:39] into the battle
[1:19:40] so you look at the the position of the
[1:19:43] seven thousand men i mean they buy their
[1:19:45] heads right to the water to drink
[1:19:48] you might think that well maybe these
[1:19:49] guys are not afraid
[1:19:52] you know
[1:19:53] and you think about these guys that you
[1:19:55] know they dip the water and they're
[1:19:57] looking over their shoulder
[1:19:59] and drinking
[1:20:00] you see
[1:20:01] yeah
[1:20:02] these guys that are
[1:20:04] they are afraid
[1:20:06] but you see them but god has a different
[1:20:08] word of looking at you
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:10] praise the lord
[1:20:13] well in one sense i think god just
[1:20:15] wanted a small number
[1:20:18] okay let's not make it complicated let's
[1:20:21] not reason into it
[1:20:25] you know
[1:20:27] but uh
[1:20:28] he has a different way
[1:20:30] to look at our strength
[1:20:33] the way we look at our strength is not
[1:20:36] the way he looks at it
[1:20:40] he has a different way
[1:20:43] to look at our strength
[1:20:46] praise the lord
[1:20:49] and with what the scripture taught us
[1:20:52] is that
[1:20:53] when god
[1:20:54] is looking for strength in you
[1:20:57] he looked for your weakness
[1:21:03] he looked for your weakness
[1:21:06] because
[1:21:07] a chain is only strong
[1:21:10] at its weaker length
[1:21:14] so he always looked for your weakness
[1:21:16] and that's where he stepped in
[1:21:19] and and perfect his strength
[1:21:23] so he has a different way
[1:21:26] and so here i saw the lord choose these
[1:21:28] uh three thousand men and send their
[1:21:31] seven thousand back
[1:21:33] i know those guys were saying these ones
[1:21:35] that were scary they were just sleeping
[1:21:36] in the water that's the one you you
[1:21:39] i mean i was i was not afraid i just put
[1:21:41] my head down
[1:21:44] but god has a different way
[1:21:46] of looking at our strength
[1:21:50] but we see here
[1:21:52] in the scripture
[1:21:56] as they went alone
[1:22:00] we want to uh
[1:22:04] read from uh verse
[1:22:06] 13.
[1:22:08] i want to take our reading from verse 13
[1:22:10] george 7 13
[1:22:13] and when gideon was come behold there
[1:22:15] was a man
[1:22:17] that tore a dream
[1:22:19] unto his fellow
[1:22:20] and said behold a dream a dream
[1:22:25] and load a kick of barley bread
[1:22:29] tumble
[1:22:30] into the host of the media

[1:22:38] now this is this is this is it don't
[1:22:41] have much to do with what we want to
[1:22:42] talk but think about it i just want you
[1:22:44] to think about it your barley bread
[1:22:47] this is a dream
[1:22:49] take it back to joseph
[1:22:56] when a man had a dream in praising
[1:22:59] he was a baker
[1:23:03] praise the lord
[1:23:08] and when he narrated that dream
[1:23:12] it had a sense of death
[1:23:16] so we see another barley cake here
[1:23:19] just in a way of looking at how
[1:23:22] scripture interprets itself
[1:23:29] praise the lord
[1:23:31] the cup bureau
[1:23:34] was the one that that joseph said
[1:23:37] you you will go you'll be free
[1:23:41] and what did he what did joseph did
[1:23:45] when his brother was going he took his
[1:23:47] cup he save a cup
[1:23:49] and put it in benjamin beg
[1:23:56] jesus said are you able to drink of my
[1:23:58] cup
[1:24:00] we know that savor represents redemption
[1:24:06] so just to get you thinking i want to
[1:24:09] grab your spirit
[1:24:10] i'm featuring for your spirit so
[1:24:13] i'm going to throw these things out so
[1:24:16] you can get a bite on it
[1:24:18] praise the lord
[1:24:20] so let's continue to read here
[1:24:22] look a cake of bali bread tumbling into
[1:24:24] the house of the media and he came
[1:24:27] and came onto a tent and and smart at
[1:24:31] that it fell
[1:24:33] and overturned
[1:24:34] and the tent laid alone and his fellow
[1:24:37] answer and said
[1:24:38] this is nothing else said the sword of
[1:24:41] gideon
[1:24:43] son of josh a man of israel fall into
[1:24:46] his hands have god deliver
[1:24:49] meeting in all the hosts and it was so
[1:24:51] when gideon heard the telling of the
[1:24:54] dream and the interpretation thereof
[1:24:56] that he worshipped
[1:24:58] and returned to
[1:25:00] the host of ezra and said arise for the
[1:25:04] lord have delivered
[1:25:06] into
[1:25:07] your hand the host of media
[1:25:10] and
[1:25:11] he divided the 300 men into three
[1:25:15] companies and pulled a trumpet
[1:25:17] in every man's hand
[1:25:20] and with empty picture
[1:25:23] and lime within the pictures and said
[1:25:26] unto them look
[1:25:29] unto me and do likewise and behold when
[1:25:32] i come
[1:25:34] to
[1:25:35] the outside of the camp it shall be dead
[1:25:38] as i do so shall you do when i blow
[1:25:42] with the trumpet
[1:25:46] i and all that are with me
[1:25:48] then blow here the trumpet also
[1:25:51] and on every side of all the camp
[1:25:56] and say
[1:25:57] the sword of the lord
[1:26:00] and of gideon
[1:26:01] praise the lord
[1:26:03] that's what i was looking for i just
[1:26:05] took that i was what i was looking for
[1:26:07] in the scripture that drew me to this uh
[1:26:10] uh passage i was looking for about to
[1:26:13] cry
[1:26:15] looking for the battle cried i was i was
[1:26:17] i was uh
[1:26:19] whether reading or listening
[1:26:21] to a book out and then and then uh
[1:26:31] they wrote the the right side of the
[1:26:32] book says
[1:26:34] that the josh joshua lived by faith was
[1:26:36] the battlecry of reformation
[1:26:39] that thing just talked on my spirit i
[1:26:42] said if reformation have a battle cry
[1:26:45] then restoration also have a battle cry
[1:26:51] so every battle that's about to cry
[1:26:53] and you have to you have to know your
[1:26:56] battle cry
[1:26:58] because it's the battle cry that wakes
[1:27:00] you up
[1:27:03] the captain
[1:27:04] sound on the line he might say that
[1:27:06] slogan or he might say something that is
[1:27:09] the battle cry
[1:27:11] and when you hear that
[1:27:13] that's when you wake up
[1:27:16] praise the lord so i believe that the
[1:27:19] bride has a battle crying
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:25] there's something that will have to wake
[1:27:26] us up for the rapture
[1:27:30] there is something that is placed in the
[1:27:31] world that we need to wake us up
[1:27:41] praise the lord
[1:27:43] definitely the judge shall lived by
[1:27:45] faith that was the battlecry of
[1:27:47] reformation
[1:27:48] that was the thing that shook the
[1:27:50] catholic war
[1:27:53] it was something that went around the
[1:27:55] world
[1:28:00] praise the lord
[1:28:04] it was an inspiration
[1:28:07] that
[1:28:08] luther had
[1:28:10] returning back from
[1:28:12] rome he was so serious he went to rome
[1:28:18] he wanted to see
[1:28:20] you know
[1:28:21] how the church handled things in rome
[1:28:23] how how he can rise to this place
[1:28:27] of importance a place of pleasing god
[1:28:31] a man that will whip himself in the
[1:28:33] roman and knock his head on the wall try
[1:28:36] to do everything because he wanted to
[1:28:38] achieve pleasing god
[1:28:40] and when he got down there to rome he
[1:28:42] saw all the immorality and the
[1:28:45] filthiness that was in in rome
[1:28:48] he says this cannot be the church he was
[1:28:51] so discouraged
[1:28:54] he got back on the boat and while he was
[1:28:56] on the boat he met some men
[1:28:58] you know they are they're a christian
[1:29:00] men
[1:29:02] and
[1:29:03] in conversation one of them
[1:29:06] repeated what uh uh paul said in the
[1:29:09] book of rumors
[1:29:10] the judge shall live by faith
[1:29:12] you know it was they were talking there
[1:29:15] and when he got back he went
[1:29:17] looking in his bible
[1:29:20] and reading
[1:29:22] what the apostle paul
[1:29:25] wrote
[1:29:26] and the holy spirit just stand there you
[1:29:29] see what the holy spirit stem is not
[1:29:31] that looter was looking for
[1:29:34] a better understanding
[1:29:36] or he was looking for some kind of a
[1:29:38] knowledge no
[1:29:40] he had a burden on his heart to do right
[1:29:45] he was not looking for what to make him
[1:29:47] famous
[1:29:49] or to make him popular he was looking
[1:29:52] for what he can do
[1:29:55] to please god
[1:29:58] and the holy spirit is making luther to
[1:30:00] know you have nothing to do but believe
[1:30:04] in what christ have already done
[1:30:09] there is nothing you have effortless to
[1:30:12] do
[1:30:15] give your body to be burned
[1:30:18] without charity is nothing
[1:30:21] give all your goods to the poor
[1:30:24] without charity it's nothing
[1:30:29] so the holy spirit brought that simple
[1:30:32] understanding and that was the thing
[1:30:34] that ginger
[1:30:35] gear
[1:30:36] looter
[1:30:37] we will say ginger amen
[1:30:40] praise the lord
[1:30:42] that was the thing that woke him up
[1:30:46] now all these things of penance and and
[1:30:49] and purgatory and all of these things uh
[1:30:51] i mean there is no salvation in it
[1:30:57] our salvation is only in the finished
[1:31:00] work
[1:31:01] of jesus christ
[1:31:03] that was the thing that woke him up
[1:31:06] so that was his battle cry
[1:31:11] when a trumpet gave an uncertain sound
[1:31:13] who will prepare for war
[1:31:15] you have to know what is the language
[1:31:19] in the trumpet glory is it for war or is
[1:31:22] it for peace
[1:31:24] so there is a battle crime if you don't
[1:31:26] know your battlecry you can never
[1:31:29] prepare
[1:31:30] for what this age will bring upon you
[1:31:34] you will just be trying everything
[1:31:37] trying to live right trying to please a
[1:31:39] church running from one church to
[1:31:40] another
[1:31:44] but to be able to face the battle of
[1:31:46] your age you must know your battlecry
[1:31:51] gideon said if you yeah me shout when
[1:31:54] the trumpet go
[1:31:56] and i say the sword of the lord and the
[1:31:59] sword of gideon
[1:32:00] run into the camp
[1:32:04] praise the lord don't run before your
[1:32:06] cry
[1:32:07] you gotta wait you gotta understand the
[1:32:09] message
[1:32:11] don't just be excited
[1:32:14] you got to understand the message
[1:32:18] are we together
[1:32:20] praise the lord
[1:32:23] amen
[1:32:25] oh how we love the lord and you know
[1:32:27] these these kind of things they can
[1:32:31] they they have a way that they can they
[1:32:33] can excite me
[1:32:35] praise the lord
[1:32:37] sorry for that but
[1:32:39] and then uh so i i went i started
[1:32:41] looking
[1:32:43] uh just just this morning i was kind of
[1:32:45] meditating and as i was saying uh i
[1:32:48] wonder what was john wesley battle cry
[1:32:53] praise the lord
[1:32:54] i i i don't know exactly but uh i i find
[1:32:58] some famous quote
[1:33:00] of john wesley that that old england
[1:33:03] preacher
[1:33:09] and he says this i will just read one or
[1:33:11] two of them he says unless god has
[1:33:14] raised you up
[1:33:19] unless god
[1:33:20] has raised you up for this very thing
[1:33:25] you will be worn out
[1:33:28] by the opposition of men
[1:33:31] and the devil that's right
[1:33:34] until unless god has raised you up for
[1:33:36] this hour
[1:33:39] unless god has raised you up for this
[1:33:42] day
[1:33:43] pretty soon you get tired
[1:33:45] amen
[1:33:48] you will get tired with all the negative
[1:33:50] things on the internet
[1:33:52] you will get tired with the way people
[1:33:53] are misrepresenting christ
[1:33:55] misrepresenting the message but if god
[1:33:58] has raised you up
[1:34:00] praise the lord you will always find a
[1:34:03] strength
[1:34:05] to press on
[1:34:08] unless god has raised you up for this
[1:34:11] very thing
[1:34:12] you will be worn out
[1:34:16] he says
[1:34:20] light yourself
[1:34:22] put yourself on fire
[1:34:25] with passion
[1:34:28] he says and people will come from fire
[1:34:29] to wash you burning
[1:34:34] amen
[1:34:38] he said get on fire for god
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:41] you have to remember
[1:34:43] that john
[1:34:45] as a child
[1:34:46] he was held out of the fire
[1:34:48] from a burning house
[1:34:53] from a burning house as a little child
[1:34:56] he was held out of the fire
[1:35:01] so just just that
[1:35:05] childhood experience
[1:35:07] had an impression on this man
[1:35:11] that he always wanted to be on fire amen
[1:35:18] he always wanted to be on fire
[1:35:22] praise the lord
[1:35:24] william simon from the azusa street
[1:35:27] his battle cry was let the fire fall
[1:35:32] amen
[1:35:34] hallelujah
[1:35:36] amen was your body to cry this morning
[1:35:39] amen the brow has a bottle cry
[1:35:42] amen praise the lord
[1:35:44] oh my
[1:35:46] you love the lord this morning let's
[1:35:48] give the lord a hand of praise amen
[1:35:50] hallelujah
[1:35:53] amen what a wonderful jesus yourself
[1:35:56] [Applause]
[1:35:58] what a wonderful jesus we sell
[1:36:01] driving yesterday coming here and uh
[1:36:04] just to spend some time
[1:36:06] and and visit with some friends and
[1:36:09] i was playing the message of deity of
[1:36:12] jesus christ i played that many times
[1:36:15] but you see sometimes something have to
[1:36:17] be on your mind
[1:36:18] for the holy spirit to pick up certain
[1:36:20] things and show it to you
[1:36:22] amen and what was on my mind actually
[1:36:25] that i wanted to preach on the message
[1:36:27] when the lions wrote
[1:36:29] that was what i wanted to preach
[1:36:31] so i was as i was looking at uh
[1:36:35] i was looking at uh
[1:36:37] i was looking at
[1:36:42] what happens
[1:36:43] when two lions have the same prey
[1:36:49] praise the lord
[1:36:51] because because in revelation chapter 10
[1:36:54] if we return back then
[1:36:59] in revelation chapter 10 if we would
[1:37:01] turn back there
[1:37:06] the scripture says
[1:37:14] praise the lord
[1:37:25] are we together
[1:37:27] in revelation chapter 10 verse 3
[1:37:30] when this mighty angel cried he cried
[1:37:33] with a loud voice
[1:37:35] as when a lion ruleth
[1:37:39] amen
[1:37:41] as when a lion ruleth
[1:37:44] so we see that this mighty angel
[1:37:48] having an association with the lion of
[1:37:50] the trap of judah
[1:37:54] praise the lord
[1:37:56] he cried with a live voice as when the
[1:37:58] lion ruleth
[1:38:00] but peter the apostle also told us
[1:38:03] in first peter chapter five
[1:38:06] amen
[1:38:09] in first peter chapter five
[1:38:11] the apostle peter told us
[1:38:14] verse eight be sober be vigilant because
[1:38:18] your adversary the devil
[1:38:20] as a rolling lion
[1:38:24] walking about
[1:38:26] seeking
[1:38:27] whom he may devour
[1:38:31] so we have the mighty injure
[1:38:36] crying out
[1:38:38] us when the lion ruleth
[1:38:41] and then we also have the devil roaming
[1:38:44] about
[1:38:47] as a rolling line
[1:38:50] praise the lord
[1:38:51] a lion can own a roar when he has a prey
[1:38:54] that's why amos said
[1:38:57] amos chapter 3.
[1:38:59] so in my mind i'm thinking i'm thinking
[1:39:02] in my mind now what happened when when
[1:39:04] uh when two
[1:39:07] lions
[1:39:08] are targeting the same parade
[1:39:11] i'm thinking about this in my mind
[1:39:13] praise the lord
[1:39:14] amen
[1:39:17] hallelujah you know asa
[1:39:19] as as uh as a poor preacher there are
[1:39:22] some people that can pull these things
[1:39:23] out better than me as a poor preacher
[1:39:25] you try to to be very creative but then
[1:39:28] thinking about that i was i was
[1:39:29] listening to messengers up just driving
[1:39:33] and then this this story came out
[1:39:34] brother branham says the deity of christ
[1:39:36] listen to this now he says i believe
[1:39:39] that we are facing are you listening to
[1:39:41] me
[1:39:42] he says we are facing now looking at the
[1:39:45] greatest drama
[1:39:49] that's ever been set in human history
[1:39:54] working out year before us
[1:39:57] the great feel of the world is here and
[1:39:59] a drama that god is going to act out
[1:40:03] right now
[1:40:05] praise the lord
[1:40:11] that's a starting he says to look around
[1:40:14] over the world and see how the things
[1:40:17] are moving together oh
[1:40:20] is something fixing to happen friends
[1:40:24] this what we have talked about
[1:40:26] and said about is right now year
[1:40:32] is ready starting
[1:40:35] everywhere breaking out
[1:40:38] now this is the picture now
[1:40:40] are you ready for this
[1:40:41] let's watch
[1:40:43] he said there is a picture
[1:40:46] i didn't like to picture to you this
[1:40:48] morning i see an alarm out in the field
[1:40:52] feeding
[1:40:54] a little feather becoming nervous
[1:40:59] he wondered
[1:41:02] look
[1:41:03] look over
[1:41:05] and read right behind him
[1:41:08] i see a lion slipping up
[1:41:15] real easy
[1:41:19] and patching his tails on the ground
[1:41:22] that's what the lion do if you if you if
[1:41:25] you if you watch a lion seeking his prey
[1:41:29] it moves
[1:41:31] gets itself to the ground and then he
[1:41:33] knocks his tail on the ground
[1:41:39] it's using a signal
[1:41:42] it's putting his wifi on
[1:41:50] praise the lord
[1:41:54] patting the stared on the ground getting
[1:41:56] his feet ready
[1:41:59] for a spring
[1:42:02] he says that's the church
[1:42:05] out in the field
[1:42:07] the little line is the church
[1:42:10] out
[1:42:12] in the field
[1:42:17] the darkness of communism
[1:42:20] is pushing all over the world
[1:42:23] closing in
[1:42:26] like a great shadow
[1:42:29] the devil like a rolling lion
[1:42:33] seeking for war
[1:42:39] and this is the lord of contracts
[1:42:43] takes like before day it's always the
[1:42:46] darkest before
[1:42:48] day because the day
[1:42:50] is breaking pushing the darkness
[1:42:53] and here's the lord of contrast you see
[1:42:56] makes it the darkest
[1:42:59] before
[1:43:00] day
[1:43:02] praise the lord
[1:43:05] now so with this picture in my mind i
[1:43:07] told myself why man i got an inspiration
[1:43:10] here
[1:43:11] lord jesus if you can just help me
[1:43:14] i have an inspiration here
[1:43:16] and then i started reading quotes from
[1:43:18] brother i'm talking about he says the
[1:43:19] rolling of a lion will scare you to
[1:43:22] death he said a lion roar will kill you
[1:43:25] before he gets on you
[1:43:30] when the lion rolls you die
[1:43:32] your eyes are just open
[1:43:36] the road of a lion will kill you
[1:43:39] before he gets to you
[1:43:44] praise the lord
[1:43:48] so we see here as i'm picturing this in
[1:43:51] my mind you see there the enemy as a
[1:43:53] rolling lion
[1:43:56] his road is a road of fear
[1:44:01] praise the lord
[1:44:03] he's trying to use everything that he
[1:44:05] can use in anything that he can use
[1:44:09] because
[1:44:12] the instant of the animal
[1:44:14] senses fear
[1:44:17] praise the lord
[1:44:19] it's strange enough because you will
[1:44:21] realize that there was no fear in eating
[1:44:27] adam plays with the lion the lion and
[1:44:29] the lamb and all of that but when may
[1:44:31] fall the first sense that breaks out
[1:44:34] among the animal was fear
[1:44:37] so an animal is always sensitive to fear
[1:44:42] if a dog can sense fear in you
[1:44:45] it will put up a defense
[1:44:50] it will never harm you
[1:44:52] unless it senses fear in you
[1:44:59] praise the lord
[1:45:00] if you realize and and get the feeling
[1:45:02] of a friend it will hang out with you as
[1:45:04] a friend
[1:45:07] i remember
[1:45:08] uh uh many years back that was that
[1:45:10] should be around 1995
[1:45:12] uh uh uh there's a there's a friend of
[1:45:15] mine a preacher friend of mine the
[1:45:16] nomination preacher friend of mine he
[1:45:18] grew up in that part of the country
[1:45:20] where i was uh uh started preaching as a
[1:45:22] young man he told me in a story one time
[1:45:24] that part of the country is a
[1:45:26] mountainous area they do uh uh uh
[1:45:30] iron ore digging gold and diamond and
[1:45:32] all of that
[1:45:34] and uh and and and and we have we we had
[1:45:38] wildlifes
[1:45:39] so he was talking about being being a
[1:45:41] young man how he went up there with a
[1:45:43] missionary one time and and they went
[1:45:47] right into
[1:45:48] at the end of lions
[1:45:51] he says and the missionary told him boy
[1:45:53] don't fear
[1:45:55] right
[1:45:56] he says don't fear
[1:45:58] me
[1:46:01] praise the lord
[1:46:05] and
[1:46:07] he says
[1:46:09] they're lying up in the mountains
[1:46:12] just saw them
[1:46:15] and because the the missionary was in
[1:46:18] the front
[1:46:21] the lion never put up no defense no
[1:46:23] attack
[1:46:24] just shook his head
[1:46:26] turn around
[1:46:28] and just walk away
[1:46:30] sure
[1:46:32] praise the lord amen
[1:46:35] and because we were talking on the same
[1:46:36] subject you know uh fear we were
[1:46:39] actually talking about you know uh uh
[1:46:41] people being afraid of dog and and all
[1:46:43] of that and you know and all that so we
[1:46:45] that's what we were talking about and
[1:46:46] then he was sharing that story with me
[1:46:48] you know well that was that was in
[1:46:50] the mountains there in india
[1:46:53] so uh uh uh so we see here that uh
[1:46:57] the the enemy
[1:47:00] as a rolling lion when he rolls when
[1:47:02] satan rolls
[1:47:04] all he breathes out is fear
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:10] all he breathes out
[1:47:12] he don't make you be afraid of a
[1:47:14] sickness or he make you be afraid of
[1:47:17] some kind of a financial condition or
[1:47:19] make you be afraid you know in in your
[1:47:21] mind are not you know not wondering what
[1:47:23] is going to happen here you know his his
[1:47:26] greatest weapon that he use is fear
[1:47:32] when he rose he rose out of fear
[1:47:36] but it's completely different
[1:47:40] from the modern angel
[1:47:44] that crowd like a rolling lion
[1:47:47] when he rolls his road is a protection
[1:47:55] praise the lord
[1:47:56] amen as we look in the world we will see
[1:47:59] that when the mighty angel rolled
[1:48:02] his road is a protection
[1:48:06] praise the lord
[1:48:07] because you will see the bible says that
[1:48:11] he had a little book in his hands
[1:48:14] and he set his right foot on the sea
[1:48:20] amen
[1:48:21] in his left foot
[1:48:23] on the lane am i right
[1:48:27] on the earth
[1:48:28] on the lane
[1:48:30] now if you go back to revelation 30
[1:48:34] titan is 17 you will understand that
[1:48:36] there was a beast that came out of the
[1:48:38] sea
[1:48:41] praise the lord amen amen
[1:48:44] in the midst of the multitude of people
[1:48:47] and there was also a power that came out
[1:48:49] of the earth
[1:48:51] so now
[1:48:53] this might angel
[1:48:55] is possessing those two powers
[1:49:00] to protect
[1:49:02] john that is a type of the bride
[1:49:06] that is going to receive the little book
[1:49:10] amen
[1:49:12] so when the mighty angel cries stay in
[1:49:15] line
[1:49:16] it's a protection for the bride
[1:49:19] when the mighty angel cry come out of
[1:49:21] her my people it's a protection for the
[1:49:23] bride
[1:49:25] praise the lord
[1:49:26] he says it's just like when you see
[1:49:29] little junior going on the street he
[1:49:30] said julian
[1:49:35] praise the lord you are not scaring him
[1:49:37] to death you are yelling to protect him
[1:49:41] from the danger that runs on the road
[1:49:43] so when a mother in your cry
[1:49:46] is a protection
[1:49:50] but when the devil has a rolly lion cry
[1:49:54] he's spilling out fear
[1:49:57] he captured his people by fear
[1:50:00] by inserting fear in them
[1:50:02] that's how he rules his people
[1:50:05] god don't rule by fear
[1:50:08] god ruled by love
[1:50:14] praise the lord
[1:50:16] amen
[1:50:21] so we see there is one
[1:50:24] lion
[1:50:26] i want to capture your mind
[1:50:29] by fear religious fear and
[1:50:31] political fear and whatever fear he can
[1:50:34] use
[1:50:36] to be able to
[1:50:40] and when he cast that fear on you
[1:50:42] his his purpose
[1:50:44] is to destroy your confidence
[1:50:48] in the protection
[1:50:50] that god has provided
[1:50:52] amen
[1:50:54] the mighty angel
[1:50:56] is screaming to provide protection for
[1:50:59] you
[1:51:00] the devil is also streaming as a rolling
[1:51:03] line
[1:51:04] to create fear
[1:51:06] that you will not have confidence
[1:51:09] in the protection
[1:51:10] that is provided
[1:51:13] [Music]
[1:51:16] praise the lord oh you think about
[1:51:18] little letter
[1:51:20] david
[1:51:22] delivering alarm
[1:51:24] from the jaw of a lion
[1:51:28] praise the lord
[1:51:30] with only a slingshot
[1:51:35] why because he had confidence
[1:51:38] in almighty god
[1:51:41] that he was trained to use that
[1:51:43] slingshot
[1:51:44] to be able to protect
[1:51:47] the slingshot was not to make the lambs
[1:51:50] afraid
[1:51:51] it was their protection
[1:51:54] praise the lord
[1:51:55] all they have saw david swinging that
[1:51:58] thing many times
[1:52:00] and when david is swinging the slingshot
[1:52:02] they don't run away they run to him
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:07] praise the lord because they know that
[1:52:09] he's using that to target the enemy
[1:52:13] they are not afraid of the word they are
[1:52:16] not afraid of of their god-given
[1:52:18] protection
[1:52:25] oh hallelujah this morning
[1:52:28] amen
[1:52:29] i've not even started preaching i'm just
[1:52:30] excited
[1:52:33] i'm just excited that that we have such
[1:52:36] a protection
[1:52:39] amen
[1:52:40] and what has been given to us as a
[1:52:43] protection
[1:52:44] the devil is coming in many forms
[1:52:48] a love form amen
[1:52:51] praise the lord amen
[1:52:54] to make us to be afraid
[1:52:57] of what is giving to us
[1:53:00] as a protection
[1:53:04] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[1:53:07] amen
[1:53:09] if we only realize
[1:53:12] that this word
[1:53:14] is given
[1:53:16] for our protection
[1:53:18] praise the lord
[1:53:20] this word is just like the bleeding
[1:53:22] lamps came that jehovah came down
[1:53:25] to wrap his children in
[1:53:28] sometimes it's not nice a bleeding skin
[1:53:31] is not nice
[1:53:33] amen
[1:53:35] a sting of blood will get all around you
[1:53:38] but that is the way god have to cover
[1:53:41] our shame
[1:53:43] without the sharing of blood
[1:53:45] there is no remission
[1:53:48] amen
[1:53:53] praise the lord
[1:53:57] so we see
[1:53:58] two crimes
[1:54:01] one of fear
[1:54:03] and one of protection
[1:54:08] praise the lord
[1:54:13] and the one of fear
[1:54:16] is to destroy us
[1:54:18] is to destroy our mind
[1:54:21] praise the lord
[1:54:23] as long as they can destroy the
[1:54:25] repetition of the messenger
[1:54:27] we can no longer have confidence in the
[1:54:29] message
[1:54:37] praise the lord
[1:54:52] my mind is growing in thousand different
[1:54:54] directions this morning
[1:54:56] but i realize i don't have thousand
[1:54:58] hours to preach
[1:55:08] so i have to tell my mind to be still
[1:55:12] and know that there is god
[1:55:17] praise the lord
[1:55:19] brother branson says this church
[1:55:22] was like that little line
[1:55:27] and there is
[1:55:29] this lion
[1:55:33] creeping out there's another caught
[1:55:35] there in paradox where he he actually
[1:55:38] bring the scene of two lions
[1:55:41] fighting over a prey
[1:55:44] who's
[1:55:45] look at that another time
[1:55:49] but
[1:55:50] what
[1:55:52] thinking about that i got into this
[1:55:54] thought of speaking on the battlecry
[1:55:56] this morning
[1:55:59] because
[1:56:01] i realized that uh i was also reading
[1:56:03] room i mean the numbers chapter 10 on on
[1:56:06] on on trumpets
[1:56:08] when moses was instructing the people
[1:56:12] about
[1:56:13] trumpets let's go to numbers chapter 10.
[1:56:16] we just pick up adversity
[1:56:20] and then if you if you have time and you
[1:56:22] are interested
[1:56:24] you can read the rest
[1:56:31] praise the lord
[1:56:33] amen praise the lord
[1:56:35] and also as you as you are listening to
[1:56:37] all the roles and all the noise
[1:56:40] what you need to descend
[1:56:42] is it a noise of protection
[1:56:45] or is it a noise
[1:56:47] to make me afraid
[1:56:50] praise the lord
[1:56:52] as you read all the things on youtube
[1:56:54] and facebook and everything
[1:56:57] it's all of these noise political noise
[1:56:59] is it a protection for me
[1:57:03] if it is not to protect me i don't want
[1:57:05] to listen to it
[1:57:09] i'm not going to get into drinking
[1:57:11] political bill when i don't have no
[1:57:12] divine protection from it
[1:57:21] praise the lord
[1:57:24] when you start to listen to doctrine
[1:57:26] noise
[1:57:29] a roar of different dot chain and this
[1:57:31] one and that one and all of that
[1:57:33] are you finding protection in there
[1:57:40] or is it creating fear in you
[1:57:46] are you becoming afraid
[1:57:52] that's what you have to discern
[1:57:55] in the noise
[1:57:57] that is around you i don't know what
[1:57:58] noise around you i don't know your noise
[1:58:02] i don't know i don't know the rolling

[1:58:20] discernment
[1:58:21] [Music]
[1:58:23] for you to discern
[1:58:24] whether it is fear
[1:58:27] or is protection
[1:58:32] if there is no sense of protection in it
[1:58:34] get away from it
[1:58:37] get away from it because it's going to
[1:58:39] consume you
[1:58:41] you're going to spend
[1:58:42] countless hours
[1:58:44] [Music]
[1:58:46] creating pressure for yourself that's
[1:58:49] right
[1:58:51] because you were talking in your head

[1:58:58] every time people are talking about it
[1:58:59] you will jump in it and it's not

[2:03:30] that psalm this morning
[2:03:32] uh
[2:03:34] praise he the lord and
[2:03:35] shout for joy and
[2:03:37] i was looking at that yesterday
[2:03:41] uh uh
[2:03:43] the time of david
[2:03:45] when it comes to
[2:03:46] to uh
[2:03:48] a joyful sound a
[2:03:50] shout for joy
[2:03:52] is actually out of a greek word
[2:03:56] praise the lord
[2:03:58] the people that don't like noise will
[2:03:59] not like this
[2:04:02] because it's it's out of a hebrew word
[2:04:05] uh
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:07] it
[2:04:08] means the cracking or the tearing of the
[2:04:12] ears

[2:04:44] or the tearing of the ear
[2:04:49] the sound of joy
[2:04:52] praise the lord amen

[2:04:57] vain emotion
[2:05:01] amen
[2:05:02] we can get loud and turn the volume up
[2:05:05] and it's just all vain emotion
[2:05:07] [Music]
[2:05:08] praise the lord
[2:05:11] but what makes the people to shout
[2:05:14] is when god was in the camp
[2:05:18] when god was identified in a camp you
[2:05:20] could not control the emotion of the
[2:05:22] people
[2:05:30] amen

[2:08:04] there's a that's a that's a
[2:08:06] national revival coming
[2:08:12] all of you people prayed and prayed and
[2:08:14] prayed and prayed and prayed amen
[2:08:16] we are not too lit yet
[2:08:22] why
[2:08:24] why do they do that
[2:08:26] why did they do that they want a great
[2:08:30] awakening
[2:08:33] praise the lord
[2:08:34] amen they want a great awakening
[2:08:41] what have they done
[2:08:44] they have not recognized
[2:08:47] the awakening of the bride
[2:08:54] praise the lord
[2:08:55] amen
[2:08:59] this is 1964
[2:09:02] the seals were just open 1963
[2:09:05] in june
[2:09:15] they have not recognized the awakening
[2:09:18] of the bride see
[2:09:20] by being christian listen to this now by
[2:09:23] being christian they feel the pull
[2:09:26] of the hour that's right
[2:09:28] the reason why you are feeling it is
[2:09:31] because something has happened
[2:09:34] you will not have a thirst of god
[2:09:37] a desire if nothing is happening
[2:09:40] if god is not moving you will not have a
[2:09:43] desire
[2:09:45] you are having a desire because there's
[2:09:47] a move of god but you have not
[2:09:49] recognized
[2:09:51] where that move is
[2:09:56] you have not identified it
[2:10:00] amen
[2:10:01] so because you have not identified it
[2:10:03] you're trying to create it
[2:10:05] [Music]
[2:10:07] you think now you have a desire to make
[2:10:09] it happy i've already happy
[2:10:14] it have already happened
[2:10:19] a principle that brother branham taught
[2:10:21] us in
[2:10:22] uh uh
[2:10:25] uh
[2:10:26] countdown
[2:10:29] and that principle as much as we have
[2:10:32] heard over and over
[2:10:34] our human reasoning has not sink in
[2:10:37] right
[2:10:40] praise the lord amen
[2:10:42] himalayan we always have the picture of
[2:10:45] saddam
[2:10:48] and what he taught is whenever god has
[2:10:51] achieved anything
[2:10:54] god has already achieved it
[2:10:57] he said before science
[2:11:00] we have the remnant as a benefit
[2:11:04] so if science is making any kind of a
[2:11:06] move
[2:11:07] which means god
[2:11:08] has already achieved something spiritual
[2:11:12] in his church
[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:16] praise the lord
[2:11:18] if science have achieved
[2:11:20] to give us siri
[2:11:23] love it
[2:11:25] praise the lord
[2:11:27] it's science i've achieved but everyone
[2:11:30] will unplug this your thing
[2:11:32] to give us siri
[2:11:34] siri where is walmart
[2:11:38] syria warmer
[2:11:40] the nearest war man
[2:11:44] praise the lord
[2:11:45] i don't know if i'm saying the right
[2:11:52] praise the lord
[2:11:54] and we feel fascinated our life is
[2:11:57] geared into that
[2:12:00] our life is geared we don't go and look
[2:12:02] for the telephone book anymore we don't
[2:12:04] go on you just take your phone and just
[2:12:06] talk to it
[2:12:09] why because god has already released in
[2:12:13] his church a spoken word power
[2:12:17] that is already in his church not to
[2:12:19] come it's already here
[2:12:25] [Music]
[2:12:26] it's just that we have not entered into
[2:12:28] it
[2:12:31] we enjoy
[2:12:32] the ones signs have given to us
[2:12:35] and don't have no idea that god has
[2:12:39] already given it to us
[2:12:45] it's never called a 40-day fast
[2:12:48] praise the lord is never taking the
[2:12:50] church back to pentecost
[2:12:56] science will never be able to achieve
[2:13:00] what they are achieving what they are
[2:13:02] giving you and myself and we are so
[2:13:04] fascinated about it science will not be
[2:13:07] able to achieve it
[2:13:09] if almighty god
[2:13:14] has not achieved it
[2:13:16] not that he will achieve it most of the
[2:13:18] time we turn the picture around and
[2:13:21] think that science is doing this so the
[2:13:23] church would no
[2:13:25] no that's the wrong picture
[2:13:27] in god's mind his church has already
[2:13:30] achieved it
[2:13:31] whether you can see it or not what are
[2:13:33] you believing on that it don't change
[2:13:35] god he's the same yesterday today and
[2:13:38] forever
[2:13:40] [Applause]
[2:13:44] praise the lord
[2:13:45] it's fear that is keeping you
[2:13:48] you are listening to the rolling of fear
[2:13:50] [Music]
[2:13:51] and you are afraid to exercise that
[2:13:53] right you are you are afraid to exercise
[2:13:56] what god has already given you
[2:14:01] but yet you take so much comfort
[2:14:05] oh you know that new app there's a new
[2:14:07] app
[2:14:09] we're always about a new app there's a
[2:14:12] new app
[2:14:13] wow
[2:14:14] apple has put a new app
[2:14:17] it's just a it's a rim it's a waste
[2:14:20] product
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:23] it's a waste product
[2:14:25] what god has already achieved
[2:14:35] praise the lord
[2:14:40] when the church is supposed to be
[2:14:41] standing
[2:14:42] and just like you are speaking to siri
[2:14:44] you need to be speaking to the devil
[2:14:48] just like you are speaking to siri you
[2:14:50] need to be speaking to the devil
[2:14:52] and speaking to your body
[2:14:55] this contrary desire of mind i speak to
[2:14:57] you you got to come in obedience
[2:15:01] [Applause]
[2:15:10] praise the lord
[2:15:12] what we have used out of this why
[2:15:15] we have used what god has given to us
[2:15:17] instead of going forward we are going in
[2:15:19] reverse
[2:15:23] we are going in reverse
[2:15:26] we are all about second pudding first
[2:15:28] pulled
[2:15:31] praise aloha
[2:15:36] want some kind of a sensation before we
[2:15:38] believe that god is with us
[2:15:41] we are always looking for some kind of
[2:15:44] ethnic vindication
[2:15:48] some kind of earthly dedication
[2:15:54] when all god wants is you to take him at
[2:15:57] his word
[2:16:00] take him at his word
[2:16:11] bro because that's why they did not
[2:16:13] recognize
[2:16:14] they did not recognize their awakening
[2:16:18] of the bride
[2:16:21] and what wants to wake her up
[2:16:23] those mysteries healing under the seals
[2:16:32] when a mighty angel rule like a lion
[2:16:34] seven thunders out of your voices
[2:16:45] praise the lord
[2:16:46] amen
[2:16:48] seven thunders alter
[2:16:50] their voices
[2:16:52] thank you bernie i mean
[2:16:55] the deacons all both of them have three
[2:16:57] letter names
[2:17:02] i'm always making them
[2:17:04] turning them outside
[2:17:07] praise the lord
[2:17:09] little samuel got me in that confusion
[2:17:12] every brother is brother ben ben how are
[2:17:15] you brother ben
[2:17:19] uh
[2:17:22] what are we talking about since
[2:17:24] are you seeing the picture
[2:17:27] amen
[2:17:30] if you want quotes i can read thousands
[2:17:32] of quotes to you
[2:17:33] but they will do you no good
[2:17:35] if they don't wake you up
[2:17:39] to the
[2:17:40] reality if they don't wake you up
[2:17:46] just like
[2:17:50] the trumpet
[2:17:52] gideon said when you hear
[2:17:55] when the trumpet is blown
[2:17:58] the message in the trumpet will be
[2:18:01] the sword of the lord
[2:18:04] and the sword of gideon
[2:18:06] so he's interpreting
[2:18:08] the unknown tones
[2:18:10] that the trumpet will blow
[2:18:15] he's interpreting the message that is in
[2:18:18] the tundras
[2:18:20] because when the trumpet blows a blast
[2:18:23] in the ears of the people
[2:18:25] but he said the message honored that
[2:18:27] sound
[2:18:28] is the sword of the law
[2:18:30] and the sword of gideon
[2:18:34] amen
[2:18:35] praise the lord
[2:18:37] so it is time to draw out your sword
[2:18:39] buddy
[2:18:40] because it's going to be bloody
[2:18:44] amen
[2:18:46] spirits are going to be flying
[2:18:48] amen
[2:18:57] so what is brother burnham identifying
[2:19:00] here
[2:19:02] there is there is a there is a thunder
[2:19:05] there is there is a trumpet
[2:19:07] that is sounding in the heart of the
[2:19:09] people
[2:19:10] they're having a desire for something
[2:19:14] a sounding in your heart
[2:19:17] praise the lord
[2:19:19] but the message of what they're supposed
[2:19:21] to be hearing has already been given but
[2:19:24] they are looking for it to come
[2:19:29] so what is happening now the devil is
[2:19:32] profiting on that
[2:19:34] to put him in a confusion he says the
[2:19:36] church has backslidded
[2:19:38] because if if the church was on fire we
[2:19:40] will be having miracles that will be
[2:19:42] fasting and praying there will be a
[2:19:43] revival
[2:19:45] the revival has already come in the
[2:19:47] opening of the word
[2:19:51] they came already
[2:19:54] praise the lord
[2:19:55] [Music]
[2:19:58] are you seeing the picture
[2:20:03] when the deep call it to the deed
[2:20:07] you will not have a desire
[2:20:10] unless there is a god to grant a desire
[2:20:16] but what happiness there when there is a
[2:20:18] desire when there is an osh we keep
[2:20:20] looking to the future
[2:20:26] we put it to the future
[2:20:31] praise the lord amen
[2:20:34] god has always done that
[2:20:37] he says moses sin in iraq and wait for
[2:20:39] me and i'm going to pass
[2:20:42] he passed before moses saw him amen
[2:20:46] it already happened before you realize
[2:20:48] it amen
[2:20:51] when you having a feeling is because it
[2:20:53] has already happened
[2:20:58] because the message to zara babel it
[2:21:00] will not be by power it will not be by
[2:21:03] might it will be by the spirit of the
[2:21:05] lord
[2:21:08] most of the time we we we get our mind
[2:21:10] in this place because we are looking for
[2:21:13] self-glorification
[2:21:14] we want to show what we have done right
[2:21:17] i fasted 10 days i fasted 20 days
[2:21:21] you know i read the horse hill
[2:21:26] praise the lord and after you finish you
[2:21:28] come out dry
[2:21:31] because you are not identifying what god
[2:21:34] is doing
[2:21:36] you are not identifying what he's doing
[2:21:38] in your life
[2:21:43] amen amen
[2:21:46] praise the lord
[2:21:48] we are allowing the enemy to magnify
[2:21:51] the weakness of our body
[2:21:53] magnify the thoughts that is in our mind
[2:21:57] that the promises of god in our heart is
[2:21:59] not sounding
[2:22:04] it's not sounding
[2:22:16] that's what he's trying to point out to
[2:22:17] these people
[2:22:20] every word people are saying let's pray
[2:22:22] let's just say
[2:22:23] he said what they are not recognizing
[2:22:26] is that there has been an awakening
[2:22:31] matthew chapter 25
[2:22:33] when jesus talked about the
[2:22:35] the the wise and the foolish virgin
[2:22:39] there was a battle cry that went out
[2:22:42] called the midnight cry
[2:22:46] praise the lord
[2:22:48] amen
[2:22:50] when the crowd went out
[2:22:52] the ones that identify it took the alarm
[2:22:55] and were going forward
[2:22:57] the one that they're not identified
[2:22:58] started to look for oil and they were
[2:23:00] going back
[2:23:04] that's right
[2:23:06] when the crowd went forth
[2:23:14] the ones that identify it the hot oil in
[2:23:16] the alarm
[2:23:17] the ones that were in the revival that
[2:23:19] were looking in the promise of god that
[2:23:21] was identifying the word of god for
[2:23:23] their age the message of the hour that
[2:23:25] was identifying what god is doing in
[2:23:27] their life
[2:23:29] they took the alarm turn it on yes and
[2:23:31] it starts to go forward
[2:23:35] the bunch of religious ones that want to
[2:23:37] pentecost we got to be shouting
[2:23:40] they're looking for oil oh we got to go
[2:23:42] back to fasting we got to go back today
[2:23:47] in the midst of that they get lost
[2:23:50] because they never got the oil
[2:23:52] [Music]
[2:23:54] always going back
[2:23:56] that is using the rear view mirror
[2:24:00] you are driving into a crotch
[2:24:05] you should only use it to see how far
[2:24:07] you are away from the devil
[2:24:10] and when you realize you are far just
[2:24:12] press on our accelerator and get more
[2:24:14] father

[2:24:40] and sound about to cry amen
[2:24:43] we will trust the lord and sound about
[2:24:45] to cry
[2:25:01] brother branham said this in a test seal
[2:25:08] he says the bride
[2:25:10] hasn't had a revival yet
[2:25:13] he says there's been no revival
[2:25:16] no manifestation to stare up
[2:25:18] the bride
[2:25:20] yet
[2:25:22] he says and we are looking for it
[2:25:25] [Music]
[2:25:27] it will take those
[2:25:29] seven
[2:25:30] unknown
[2:25:32] tongues
[2:25:35] it would take those seven unknown
[2:25:39] thunders

[2:26:10] [Music]

[2:30:14] church because you don't know what to
[2:30:15] expect
[2:30:19] preachers have sounded the wrong trumpet
[2:30:22] instead of putting the people in their
[2:30:24] promises
[2:30:25] instead of telling the people and
[2:30:27] showing them what god has already given
[2:30:30] to this bride
