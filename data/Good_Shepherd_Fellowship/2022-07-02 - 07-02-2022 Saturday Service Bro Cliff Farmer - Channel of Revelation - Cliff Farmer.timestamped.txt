[45:27] and so we
[45:28] I got in the car with Brother Scott and
[45:31] after church and I had on my suit I had
[45:34] an Overcoat I had a hat on
[45:37] we're driving down the road and I was
[45:38] shivering
[45:40] and he's just wearing a suit coat
[45:43] he's fine and he looks at me he says are
[45:46] you cold and I said yeah he said well
[45:49] maybe I should turn the heat on
[45:51] [Laughter]
[45:52] [Music]
[45:55] I said well that would help
[45:58] amen
[46:00] we love the Lord tonight and
[46:03] if we could let's just turn over to the
[46:05] book of Ephesians chapter 3
[46:15] amen thank god brother but they said it
[46:19] best he said that in this hour what a
[46:22] freedom we really have
[46:24] it's the Freedom by the son of man you
[46:26] know our freedoms in this nation are
[46:28] getting taken away
[46:29] you know little by little they're taking
[46:31] everything that that has been given to
[46:33] us they're trying to take our god-given
[46:36] rights but there is something that has
[46:37] come to us that is a freedom that no man
[46:40] can take away
[46:41] you know I was talking with brother
[46:43] Prater yesterday and we're looking at
[46:45] you know uh the Revelation that has come
[46:48] in this hour
[46:49] and so you know there's got to come a
[46:52] final Revelation that changes this body
[46:56] but we know one thing that the soul has
[46:59] already been changed and we know that
[47:00] the spirit has already been changed and
[47:03] so no matter what the government does no
[47:06] matter you know they can take this body
[47:08] but one thing about it the soul is
[47:10] already raptured so we're thankful for
[47:12] that Revelation in this hour amen
[47:15] Ephesians chapter 3 verse 1.
[47:18] for this cause I Paul the prisoner of
[47:21] Jesus Christ for you gentiles
[47:24] if ye have heard of the dispensation of
[47:27] the grace of God which has given me to
[47:29] you word
[47:31] how that by Revelation he made known
[47:33] unto me the mystery
[47:35] as I wrote afore
[47:37] in a few words whereby when you read you
[47:41] may understand my knowledge in the
[47:43] mystery of Christ and you can be seated
[47:47] this evening
[47:50] all right I want to take for a thought
[47:52] tonight something that may seem uh
[47:54] Elementary to you
[47:56] but it seems like in this hour when we
[48:00] are we should be at the peak of
[48:02] Revelation
[48:03] that many people are starting to turn
[48:05] away
[48:06] from the basics and turn away from the
[48:08] original truth and so I I just want to
[48:12] take a simple thought tonight on the
[48:13] proper channel for revelation
[48:17] the proper channel for Revelations as I
[48:19] said this is this is going to be basic
[48:22] um but I've never claimed to be a deep
[48:24] preacher but I just want to look at this
[48:27] you know uh uh uh it seems like people
[48:29] are falling away from the fact and I
[48:31] don't say just the truth but it's a fact
[48:33] that God sent us a prophet in this hour
[48:35] and you know that all Revelation all
[48:39] scripture Revelation must come through a
[48:41] prophet and so I just want to take and
[48:44] where I draw my title from the proper
[48:46] Channel brother Brandon was speaking
[48:48] about the upper room and he said so when
[48:50] they got completely surrendered God came
[48:53] down again in the Shekinah Glory and
[48:56] filled all the house where they were
[48:58] setting
[48:59] he said what did God do
[49:01] like the ark dropping into its proper
[49:05] sockets for the message of that day God
[49:08] dropped back into his proper Channel
[49:12] so understand God has a certain channel
[49:14] that he operates in God has a certain
[49:17] way that he does things and so if you
[49:19] can ever find the channel in which God
[49:21] operates then you'll know from that day
[49:24] forward this is the way he's going to do
[49:26] it God doesn't change his tactics
[49:28] brother Branham says in one place he
[49:29] said God always uses the same tactics he
[49:33] said and so does the devil so if you can
[49:35] understand the way the devil operates
[49:37] and understand the way God operates you
[49:40] become more than a conqueror
[49:43] now let's go back through this
[49:45] Ephesians 3 1 for this cause
[49:48] I want to look at the calls now the
[49:50] prophet of God said that Ephesians
[49:52] parallels Joshua Ephesians is the
[49:54] placing of sons I believe that's where
[49:56] we're at today is we're in the age of
[49:58] the placing of sons
[50:01] and he said for this cause I Paul
[50:05] the prisoner of Jesus Christ I want you
[50:07] to look at this I apologize he's saying
[50:10] this starts with me
[50:12] I'm a prisoner but it's for you
[50:17] now watch this if you have heard of the
[50:19] dispensation of the grace of God which
[50:22] is given where
[50:24] it's given to the messenger of the age
[50:27] the Revelation does not come through
[50:29] some preacher somewhere the revelation
[50:31] of the age comes through the messenger
[50:33] of the age but watch I says it it's
[50:36] given me
[50:39] to you
[50:42] how that by Revelation he made known
[50:44] unto who
[50:46] come on now he's showing us the channel
[50:49] in which Revelation comes
[50:53] how that by Revelation he made known
[50:55] unto me
[50:57] the mystery
[50:58] as I wrote it for in a few words
[51:01] whereby when ye read he's he's showing
[51:05] us this this channel here God's giving
[51:07] it to me I'm giving it to you God done
[51:10] it to me but it's for you this came to
[51:13] me now I'm giving it to you and now he
[51:15] says it was made known unto me for one
[51:18] reason that when you read that you may
[51:22] understand
[51:23] my knowledge in the mystery of Christ
[51:26] which in other Ages was not not made
[51:29] known Unto the Sons of men
[51:31] as it is now revealed unto His Holy
[51:34] Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so
[51:38] Paul is showing us that when a messenger
[51:40] to the age comes on the scene all
[51:43] revelation will come through the mouth
[51:45] of that messenger Acts 3 22 says for
[51:49] Moses truly said unto the fathers a
[51:52] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[51:55] unto you of your brethren like unto me
[51:59] and him shall ye hear in all things
[52:01] whatsoever he shall say unto you and it
[52:04] shall come to pass that every soul which
[52:06] shall not hear that Prophet watch the
[52:08] way he says it it's not just hearing
[52:11] some word it's it's not uh Every Soul
[52:13] that that you know doesn't believe uh uh
[52:16] that Jesus died for their sins you know
[52:18] we we it seems like even around the
[52:20] message we're starting to kind of preach
[52:22] achieving the gospel you know that we
[52:25] don't we don't put emphasis on what God
[52:28] has done in this hour and I do think
[52:30] that if you're a real son and daughter
[52:33] of God you want to see everybody make it
[52:35] but you've got to understand there's one
[52:38] provided way in this hour to make it
[52:41] that's right amen praise the Lord and he
[52:44] said in it shall come to pass that every
[52:47] soul which shall not hear which will not
[52:49] hear that Prophet shall be destroyed
[52:52] from among the people see understanding
[52:54] Noah's in Noah's day there was only one
[52:57] way to get over there was only one way
[52:59] to make it and that was through the ark
[53:01] and in this hour there is one provided
[53:05] way there is one way to make a Rapture
[53:08] it is through the rapturing word brought
[53:11] To Us by the mouth of Malachi chapter
[53:13] four
[53:14] [Music]
[53:15] you know when I think about this why why
[53:18] do we not share this to the world
[53:22] you know this message people are afraid
[53:26] ask a Baptist person what they believe
[53:30] they'll tell you once they've always
[53:31] saved I'm a member of the Baptist Church
[53:34] ask someone that's a Pentecost what do
[53:37] you believe I'm UPC We Believe speaking
[53:40] in tongues it's initial evidence of the
[53:42] Holy Ghost but ask a message believer
[53:44] what do we believe and what do we tell
[53:45] them
[53:49] is this foreign to you come on now
[53:51] sometimes we're afraid to say I believe
[53:54] that in this hour God sent a prophet to
[53:57] the age
[53:59] there's got to be a boldness within it
[54:02] how is the world going to know if we
[54:05] that have the Revelation do not share
[54:08] the revelation
[54:10] remind of a story one time brother Billy
[54:12] Paul told he said he went to his dentist
[54:14] and he said I've been I'd been going to
[54:17] him for years and he said I was sitting
[54:19] in the dentist chair and he said he put
[54:22] a book A Spoken Word Book around in
[54:25] front of me
[54:26] and he said Billy is this your daddy
[54:31] and he said yes it is
[54:34] he said then why haven't you told me
[54:36] about him before
[54:38] he said Billy if I had a daddy like that
[54:41] I'd tell the world about him
[54:44] I want to tell you I believe that if we
[54:46] really understand what the message is
[54:49] and
[54:50] and not has stood for us the lips could
[54:53] not stay close but we would have to
[54:56] Rejoice we would have to tell the
[54:58] co-workers where we go to school we were
[55:01] in a restaurant look what God has done
[55:05] in my day
[55:07] really beautiful
[55:09] [Music]
[55:15] so you might say well I'm afraid of
[55:16] rejection
[55:21] Luke 17 25.
[55:25] he says but first he must suffer many
[55:27] things
[55:28] and be rejected of this generation
[55:31] now we are the light of God to the world
[55:36] and now he's saying that if you are like
[55:39] Christ
[55:41] brother Bynum said one time he said you
[55:43] would say you want to be christ-like he
[55:44] said get ready to be crucified
[55:47] so said he must first suffer many things
[55:49] and be rejected of this generation
[55:52] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[55:56] shall it be also in the days of the son
[55:58] of man
[55:59] they did eat
[56:01] they drink they married wives they were
[56:04] given in marriage until the day that
[56:07] Noah entered the Ark and the flood came
[56:09] and destroyed them all
[56:12] hmm
[56:13] now look at this
[56:15] it's important to follow the voice of
[56:18] the messenger
[56:19] and I think sometimes that we forget how
[56:22] strong that that messenger's position is
[56:26] we've come to a point where men decide
[56:28] now I I I've got a revelation and
[56:31] brother Brandon was wrong I'm going to
[56:32] tell you when a man says brother Brandon
[56:34] was wrong you just don't listen to
[56:35] anything else he's got to say
[56:37] I heard I heard a man the other day
[56:40] claiming this message got a large Church
[56:42] in the message and he stood up and he
[56:44] said brother Branham said this but he
[56:46] was wrong there and then he proceeded to
[56:49] tell what he thought was the right
[56:51] Revelation and I thought my goodness
[56:53] where are we coming to listen in this
[56:56] hour of all the billions of people that
[57:00] are walking the Earth and have walked
[57:02] the Earth since 1909 God picked one man
[57:06] out of those billions of people to bring
[57:09] his word to this generation I say he
[57:12] didn't get it wrong the man God picked
[57:16] done a good job
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:19] [Music]
[57:20] Hallelujah
[57:24] I want to show you how much power there
[57:26] is
[57:27] in a prophet's word
[57:30] one time the word comes to Isaiah
[57:32] he said go to hezekiah's house and tell
[57:34] him he's going to die
[57:37] thus saith the Lord
[57:39] he's going to die
[57:41] I want to ask you can thus saith the
[57:43] Lord be wrong
[57:45] so the prophet Isaiah goes to hezekiah's
[57:48] house
[57:49] and he says Hezekiah
[57:51] thus saith the Lord you're not going to
[57:53] raise up from this bit
[57:56] now Hezekiah believed in the word
[58:00] Prophet for his day Isaiah
[58:03] so what he done is he got fear in his
[58:06] heart and he dropped to his knees and
[58:08] the scripture said he turned his face to
[58:10] the wall what did Hezekiah do he began
[58:13] to repent to God and beg God for his
[58:16] life
[58:17] and the scripture says that when
[58:20] Hezekiah was still in the court yes
[58:24] right in other words Hezekiah was still
[58:27] in his front yard
[58:29] that God excuse me Isaiah was still in
[58:32] the front yard that God heard hezekiah's
[58:36] prayer and he tells Isaiah go back and
[58:39] tell him
[58:40] he's going to live
[58:44] now a word Prophet has said thus saith
[58:48] the Lord
[58:49] and five minutes later
[58:53] God says
[58:56] go tell him he's not gonna die
[58:59] so now the word Prophet comes back to
[59:03] Hezekiah
[59:05] it says Hezekiah had the saith the Lord
[59:08] 70 years have been added to you
[59:16] he said what thing would you ask of the
[59:18] Lord
[59:19] to show you
[59:21] that this is his word
[59:25] what did Hezekiah ask
[59:28] he said let the sun thou
[59:30] be turned back
[59:32] 10 degrees
[59:36] the sun thou at 10 degrees on a sundial
[59:39] is about 15 minutes
[59:43] now God's word profit cannot be wrong
[59:47] and thus saith the Lord cannot be wrong
[59:51] so the prophet tells him thus saith the
[59:53] Lord you're going to die walks out of
[59:56] the room and God says go back and tell
[59:58] him thus saith the Lord You're Going To
[1:00:00] Live
[1:00:01] and so for that word to be true time was
[1:00:06] turned back
[1:00:08] so that the word that has a cut that
[1:00:11] Isaiah told Hezekiah it was now before
[1:00:15] the time that he ever prophesied let me
[1:00:17] say it this way they could have came to
[1:00:19] Isaiah and said Isaiah at 7 30 you said
[1:00:23] he was going to die and he could say
[1:00:25] it's only 7 25. we've not even got to 7
[1:00:30] 30 yet I want to tell you when a word
[1:00:33] Prophet speaks God will back it up
[1:00:36] foreign
[1:00:38] [Applause]
[1:00:40] there might be things that brother
[1:00:42] Branham said that looks like it
[1:00:43] contradicts don't worry about it
[1:00:48] don't let it confuse you
[1:00:50] [Music]
[1:00:53] brother Branham said one time he said
[1:00:55] when Jesus said unless you eat my flesh
[1:00:58] and drink my blood he said he said it to
[1:01:01] throw the unbelievers off
[1:01:05] you understand Jesus wanted the crowd
[1:01:09] thinned out we're in an hour where where
[1:01:12] people are starting we want to build
[1:01:14] bigger churches and we want more people
[1:01:16] to come to the church I want you to
[1:01:18] understand I believe we need to get the
[1:01:19] law saved but we're in an hour where the
[1:01:22] unbelievers are going to be thinned out
[1:01:26] God came to Gideon one time and he said
[1:01:29] Gideon you can't fight this battle
[1:01:32] you Gideon said why he said you got too
[1:01:33] many you got too many soldiers
[1:01:37] God says so if I'm going to show my
[1:01:39] glory we're going to have to thin the
[1:01:41] crowd
[1:01:42] ah let me move
[1:01:45] Amos 3 7.
[1:01:48] surely
[1:01:50] the Lord God will do nothing
[1:01:56] I looked at this word nothing
[1:01:58] now I like to look at words you know
[1:02:01] nothing means
[1:02:04] says not a thing
[1:02:11] not a single thing
[1:02:15] not anything
[1:02:17] or Nothing at All
[1:02:20] I read this to the church and I said so
[1:02:22] that means
[1:02:23] you know we we sometimes we think about
[1:02:25] that well God won't do anything like you
[1:02:27] know some great big no God's not going
[1:02:30] to do anything at all
[1:02:32] that it didn't already come to the mouth
[1:02:33] of a prophet
[1:02:35] so if you want a revelation about
[1:02:37] marriage and divorce it's the prophet
[1:02:40] you want a marriage you want a
[1:02:42] revelation about uh uh the opening of
[1:02:44] the seventh seal it's the prophet you
[1:02:47] want a revelation about Christmas it's
[1:02:49] the Prophet come on
[1:02:52] people get all these Revelations and you
[1:02:55] know what I find I find churches start
[1:02:56] splitting because of little ideas
[1:02:59] when if we would go back to the word
[1:03:04] our church I I'll just tell you I'll
[1:03:06] share with you one of the worst things
[1:03:07] that's ever happened in our our local
[1:03:09] assembly it was devastating there was a
[1:03:12] a real uh uh a real trial we went
[1:03:16] through here a couple of years ago and
[1:03:17] and the church split
[1:03:19] and you know what I found it was over
[1:03:21] opinion
[1:03:25] there wasn't any word
[1:03:27] no one could
[1:03:29] they couldn't even manufacture where
[1:03:31] word wasn't preached correctly
[1:03:34] right but it was how I think it needs to
[1:03:36] be this way and I think it needs to be
[1:03:38] that way and so you have to understand
[1:03:40] just like there's a proper channel for
[1:03:42] the Revelation to come there's also a
[1:03:44] proper channel in the church
[1:03:46] that's right yes
[1:03:50] well I'm gonna preach like I'm at home
[1:03:52] because I I fly home tomorrow anyway so
[1:03:56] God did not ordain everyone in the
[1:03:59] church to come up with how the church
[1:04:00] should run God brought it through the
[1:04:03] mouth of a prophet and it's passed down
[1:04:04] to a pastor of the church and it is then
[1:04:07] filtered out to the people but what I
[1:04:09] find is one brother decides it should be
[1:04:11] this way and one sister decides it
[1:04:13] should be this way and now there's
[1:04:15] conflict in the church
[1:04:17] so you want to know why there's no
[1:04:18] Revival too many opinions
[1:04:24] all right
[1:04:27] he said he'll do nothing
[1:04:29] but he revealeth that he revealeth his
[1:04:32] secret
[1:04:33] unto his servants the prophets
[1:04:35] brother random says now
[1:04:37] remember this nothing can be revealed
[1:04:42] God will do nothing at all
[1:04:44] until first he reveals it to his
[1:04:45] servants the prophets
[1:04:48] and before he does anything
[1:04:51] he reveals it
[1:04:53] he said if you ever fail to do something
[1:04:57] or a revelation or something comes to
[1:05:00] you strangely
[1:05:01] something warningly or something be
[1:05:04] careful
[1:05:05] Satan is his Sly and as slick as he can
[1:05:08] be
[1:05:10] he said put it with the word of God
[1:05:13] and consult your pastor
[1:05:16] you know what we want to do we want to
[1:05:18] consult our favorite preacher
[1:05:22] all right
[1:05:24] I can tell you that's the reason our
[1:05:27] church split people didn't go to the
[1:05:28] word and consult the pastor
[1:05:31] right man it's it's tied in here tonight
[1:05:34] now I don't know what I don't know who's
[1:05:36] devil I'm stepping on but listen it
[1:05:39] we're going to keep stepping okay
[1:05:43] but when you get a favorite evangelist
[1:05:45] and then the word has to be filtered
[1:05:47] through his mindset his idea listen God
[1:05:50] didn't ordain any other evangelists to
[1:05:53] operate and pass to this church
[1:05:55] so when you consult the word you go back
[1:05:57] to your pastor
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:01] see now watch this he's showing us how
[1:06:04] the channel of Revelation comes
[1:06:06] now got to come through a word prophet
[1:06:10] Malachi chapter 4.
[1:06:12] says behold
[1:06:14] I send you
[1:06:17] who's you
[1:06:21] I'm going to tell you it's me
[1:06:24] I told you I'm free I'm going to preach
[1:06:25] simple but these are the basics that
[1:06:28] people around this message are leaving
[1:06:31] we should still be excited that God did
[1:06:34] this for us
[1:06:36] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[1:06:40] before the coming of the great and
[1:06:42] Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[1:06:44] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:06:45] children and the Heart of the children
[1:06:47] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[1:06:51] the Earth with a curse now we understand
[1:06:53] brother Branham fulfills more than just
[1:06:55] one part in scripture brother Branham
[1:06:58] fulfills
[1:06:59] Malachi chapter 4
[1:07:01] but he also fulfills the seventh angel
[1:07:06] Messenger to the Church of laodicea
[1:07:08] that's right we understand that now I
[1:07:10] want us to look at this Revelation
[1:07:11] chapter 10 verse 1 it says I saw another
[1:07:15] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:07:18] cold with a cloud
[1:07:21] and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:07:23] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[1:07:26] his feet as pillars of Fire
[1:07:29] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:07:31] open and he set his right foot upon the
[1:07:34] sea and his left foot upon the Earth and
[1:07:37] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[1:07:39] roarth and when he had cried seven
[1:07:42] Thunders uttered their voices
[1:07:44] and when the seven Thunders had uttered
[1:07:47] their voices I was about to write and I
[1:07:50] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[1:07:52] seal up those things which the seven
[1:07:54] Thunders uttered and right them not why
[1:07:57] couldn't he ride them because it had to
[1:08:00] be revealed in our hour
[1:08:02] because those Revelations laying under
[1:08:06] what the seven Thunders uttered was what
[1:08:09] would Rapture the church
[1:08:12] and God was not going to let there be a
[1:08:15] premature Rapture there had to be a
[1:08:18] bride to come into maturity so God said
[1:08:21] you got to seal it up if John would have
[1:08:24] let that out
[1:08:26] there would have already been a Rapture
[1:08:27] in the other ages but it had to be saved
[1:08:30] until this hour
[1:08:32] and the angel which I saw
[1:08:35] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:08:37] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[1:08:41] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[1:08:43] created heaven and the things that
[1:08:45] therein are and the earth and the things
[1:08:48] that they're in are and the Sea and the
[1:08:51] things which are therein that there
[1:08:53] should be time no longer
[1:08:56] but
[1:08:57] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:09:01] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:09:05] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:09:09] hath declared to his servants the
[1:09:11] prophets I want us to look at this we
[1:09:15] have to understand the channel in which
[1:09:17] the word comes but brother Branham he
[1:09:20] tells us about one time when he was up
[1:09:22] in Sabino Canyon now watch this the
[1:09:25] mighty Angel comes down with a book open
[1:09:31] brother Branham
[1:09:32] catches the book
[1:09:35] Hebrews chapter 10 says lo I come in the
[1:09:40] volume of the book so the coming of the
[1:09:43] book is the coming of the Lord
[1:09:46] [Applause]
[1:09:51] he says
[1:09:53] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:09:56] Earth
[1:09:57] lifted up his hand to heaven now watch
[1:10:00] this there's a mighty Angel Christ the
[1:10:03] word descending but there's an Angel
[1:10:07] that's standing on Earth
[1:10:09] with his hand in the air
[1:10:12] and let me read it to you this way
[1:10:14] brother Brandon said one day in Sabino
[1:10:16] Canyon I was standing with my hands in
[1:10:21] the air
[1:10:22] praying and a sword came into my hands
[1:10:27] here's the prophet of God wanting to
[1:10:30] bring Christ to the bride
[1:10:33] and to bring the introduction a sword
[1:10:37] comes in his hands
[1:10:46] he said you know that I stood there and
[1:10:48] looked at it just as natural as my hand
[1:10:51] is now not knowing what it meant and it
[1:10:54] was left me with a voice that said this
[1:10:57] is the sword of the king and then later
[1:11:01] when the angel of the Lord reveal it it
[1:11:03] was the word in the hand you have to
[1:11:06] understand that God could not break his
[1:11:09] word so for God to come to the Earth he
[1:11:13] promised that he would come with a shout
[1:11:15] of voice and a trumpet but for God to
[1:11:18] come to a bride first he had to come to
[1:11:21] a prophet I think we forget sometimes
[1:11:24] how great the revealed word is but this
[1:11:27] revealed word is literally Christ
[1:11:29] himself
[1:11:31] all right we are not feeding on the
[1:11:34] thoughts of a man we're not feeding on
[1:11:37] ideas of man but we are feeding on what
[1:11:40] the prophet said what's
[1:11:42] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:11:46] Jesus said unless you eat my flesh this
[1:11:50] is his flesh
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:58] he said
[1:12:00] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:12:02] and the word mystery there means
[1:12:04] a secret Doctrine
[1:12:08] as he hath declared unto his servants
[1:12:10] the prophets and the word Prophet there
[1:12:12] in the Greek it means an interpreter of
[1:12:15] the Divine will of God
[1:12:18] God would whisper in the ear of one man
[1:12:22] what he wanted it makes me think of one
[1:12:24] time a little girl named hadessa
[1:12:27] she came
[1:12:29] before the king
[1:12:31] but before she went before the king she
[1:12:33] had to come through one man a
[1:12:35] Chamberlain
[1:12:36] and the scripture tells us that the king
[1:12:38] told the Chamberlain this is what I want
[1:12:40] in a bride and so the Chamberlain told
[1:12:43] all of the virgins of the land what the
[1:12:45] king wanted but they didn't want to
[1:12:47] listen to him right the scripture says
[1:12:50] they could go in with whatever Jewels
[1:12:51] they wanted and whatever garments they
[1:12:53] wanted but little hadesta when she came
[1:12:55] in there her name was changed her name
[1:12:58] was changed from hadessa the name
[1:13:00] hadessa means Myrtle which Myrtle is a
[1:13:03] tree it is an earth-bound object and he
[1:13:07] changed her name to Esther which means
[1:13:11] star which is a Heavenly object you
[1:13:15] understand when the word of God the
[1:13:17] scripture says that in there was a new
[1:13:19] name written and when God gives you a
[1:13:22] new name it takes you from an Earthbound
[1:13:25] creature to a heaven-bound preacher
[1:13:32] little Esther
[1:13:34] she comes before the king
[1:13:37] and when the King Caesar it said that he
[1:13:40] loved her above all other women but I
[1:13:42] want you to catch something out of the
[1:13:44] Scripture it said that
[1:13:46] it said that haggai preferred Esther and
[1:13:51] the word preferred there in the Greek
[1:13:53] means he changed yes sir and I began to
[1:13:57] think that it wasn't he himself that
[1:13:58] changed her but when when when uh when
[1:14:02] haggai begin to speak to Esther and tell
[1:14:06] her and reveal to her the heart of the
[1:14:09] king then Esther begin to Adorn herself
[1:14:13] in the heart of the king so when Esther
[1:14:17] presented herself in the words of the
[1:14:21] Chamberlain she presented herself in it
[1:14:25] and the King saw her and said she is my
[1:14:28] thoughts expressed
[1:14:30] [Applause]
[1:14:32] power there was a word Prophet only one
[1:14:36] man that God Whispers in his ear and
[1:14:40] said this is what I want in a bride and
[1:14:43] when we dress in that word we become
[1:14:47] God's thoughts expressed
[1:14:52] oh
[1:14:54] he said the mystery
[1:14:58] will be finished
[1:15:00] so the seventh Angels Ministry
[1:15:03] is to complete all of the mystery
[1:15:07] Revelations 10 8 says
[1:15:09] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:15:11] speak unto me again
[1:15:13] and said go
[1:15:14] and take the little book which is open
[1:15:17] in the hand of the angel
[1:15:19] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:15:21] Earth
[1:15:22] so now the book
[1:15:24] the word
[1:15:27] Christ the word
[1:15:29] is back on Earth
[1:15:32] brother Branham says we're told in
[1:15:35] Revelation 10 that there will be a
[1:15:36] messenger in the last day
[1:15:39] that will gather up these little ends
[1:15:41] and bring them together
[1:15:43] and went and then the mystery of God
[1:15:46] would be finished at the sounding of
[1:15:48] this Angel which was a messenger of the
[1:15:51] Earth
[1:15:51] then one came down from heaven with his
[1:15:54] hands up rainbow over his head and swore
[1:15:57] that there would be time no more an
[1:15:58] angel taking an oath
[1:16:00] Alaska says this he says and when we see
[1:16:04] this thing materializing
[1:16:06] oh how sincere we should be
[1:16:10] and the word materialize means to cause
[1:16:13] to appear in bodily form
[1:16:18] and in our hour we have seen Christ
[1:16:21] appear in a bodily form
[1:16:26] let me put it to you this way
[1:16:28] brother Branham was not the one that
[1:16:30] preached marriage in divorce right
[1:16:32] exactly at the end of marriage and
[1:16:35] divorce brother Brandon said I forgive
[1:16:36] you of your sins
[1:16:38] brother Branham was a man born of sex he
[1:16:42] had no right to forgive any one of their
[1:16:44] sins that was not William Branham
[1:16:46] standing there preaching marriage and
[1:16:48] divorce but it was Christ in body form
[1:16:56] I was talking to a brother that was
[1:16:58] there
[1:16:59] when brother Brandon was preaching
[1:17:02] when he called out the folks behind him
[1:17:05] and he said he said brother Brandon was
[1:17:07] preaching he said there was a curtain in
[1:17:09] front of him like this it was two two
[1:17:11] separate auditoriums there was one
[1:17:12] facing this way and one facing this way
[1:17:15] and he said so brother Branham didn't
[1:17:17] have anyone behind him
[1:17:19] he said but when he began to prophesy he
[1:17:23] turned his back
[1:17:25] he literally made a show Almost of what
[1:17:29] was going on and if you listen to the
[1:17:31] prophet of God he says it this way he
[1:17:33] says he turns and he says now there's a
[1:17:35] woman sitting behind me
[1:17:38] just like Sarah was behind Abraham in
[1:17:42] the tent what was it showing that
[1:17:45] Melchizedek once again had picked up a
[1:17:49] flesh body and was speaking to Abraham
[1:17:53] and Sarah what was the word of
[1:17:55] Melchizedek
[1:17:57] you're going to birth a son that's right
[1:17:59] there's going to be a birth in you that
[1:18:02] the promise is coming through you and
[1:18:05] our Melchizedek came again in this hour
[1:18:07] to tell a bride there's a birth coming
[1:18:10] and it is coming through the church
[1:18:16] that's right II Peter 1 19.
[1:18:21] it says we have also a more sure word of
[1:18:24] Prophecy that's right
[1:18:26] a sure word
[1:18:27] this is not something we have to guess
[1:18:30] he said where unto you do you do well
[1:18:32] that you take heed
[1:18:34] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[1:18:36] place until the day Dawn and the day
[1:18:39] star arise in your hearts knowing this
[1:18:42] first that no Prophecy of the scripture
[1:18:45] is of any private interpretation that's
[1:18:48] right
[1:18:49] right this word private means of one's
[1:18:52] own self
[1:18:53] so I'm going to go back I want to go
[1:18:55] back to what I said earlier when you
[1:18:57] begin to find someone that's bringing
[1:18:58] Revelation and they don't have a quote
[1:19:00] to back it up
[1:19:01] that is a private interpretation
[1:19:04] when you find someone preaching
[1:19:06] something and cannot back it with the
[1:19:08] messenger of Malachi 4 it is a
[1:19:11] denominational Spirit on the man
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:15] I want to say to you we have we have
[1:19:18] blasted denominations that say Methodist
[1:19:20] on them right we have blasted
[1:19:23] denominations that say Baptist over the
[1:19:25] door we have bashed the denominations
[1:19:28] that say Pentecost over the door but I'm
[1:19:30] going to tell you there is denomination
[1:19:32] of polygamy and denomination of return
[1:19:34] Ministry denomination of Joseph Fowler
[1:19:38] there's many denominations around this
[1:19:41] message
[1:19:42] let me tell you how the nomination
[1:19:44] starts one word
[1:19:47] brother bam said it was only one word
[1:19:52] okay let me just stop a minute
[1:19:55] go back to the scripture in the Book of
[1:19:57] Genesis
[1:19:58] it said that the serpent said to Eve did
[1:20:02] not the Lord say
[1:20:05] you can eat of every tree
[1:20:07] of the garden
[1:20:09] now I want you to watch when the serpent
[1:20:11] told Eve when he asked her didn't the
[1:20:13] Lord say this it was verbatim What the
[1:20:15] Lord said
[1:20:18] and the way that the devil will trick
[1:20:20] the church is he starts off with reading
[1:20:22] Quotes
[1:20:23] come on Church
[1:20:25] the devil does not come in and say
[1:20:27] William random is a false prophet no he
[1:20:29] knows better than that but he comes in
[1:20:32] Sly and he says did not he say
[1:20:34] and Eve says oh yes evangelist he sure
[1:20:37] did yes he says that is exactly what he
[1:20:41] said now the serpent and Eve are having
[1:20:43] a word conversation
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:46] and then
[1:20:48] he says but wait a minute
[1:20:51] there it is
[1:20:53] maybe just that one word
[1:20:57] maybe maybe you surely won't maybe
[1:21:01] that's what he meant
[1:21:05] I'm gonna get in trouble with latte but
[1:21:07] I'm going to tell you I don't care who
[1:21:09] the man is or how big the message
[1:21:11] preacher is when a man steps behind the
[1:21:15] pulpit
[1:21:17] and says I know brother Branham said
[1:21:19] this but brother Branham was wrong he
[1:21:22] should be voted out
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:26] come on I say it's time that we as
[1:21:30] Believers take a stand
[1:21:32] Joshua Joshua stepped up to the captain
[1:21:36] of the host and he drawed his sword he
[1:21:39] said are you for us or are you against
[1:21:42] us you are either in the message or out
[1:21:45] of the message
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:49] and the prophet of God said this he said
[1:21:52] to disbelieve one word you might as well
[1:21:55] disbelieve all of it
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:22:02] we all believers here
[1:22:04] foreign
[1:22:07] don't listen to these preachers that
[1:22:09] come up with these ideas
[1:22:11] it's the nomination trying to creep back
[1:22:13] in it brings death
[1:22:16] the word brings life one word change
[1:22:20] brings death
[1:22:24] brother Branham says
[1:22:26] I want you to see this so bad
[1:22:29] you cannot slightly doubt any of it
[1:22:36] not any of it
[1:22:38] hmm
[1:22:41] brother cliff
[1:22:43] you know there's things that he says
[1:22:46] that sometimes it don't look like it it
[1:22:49] really adds up
[1:22:50] don't slightly doubt any of it
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:22:59] well you know
[1:23:00] brother Branham sometimes says things
[1:23:03] that it sounds like this and it sounds
[1:23:04] like that well it don't matter what it
[1:23:06] sounds like you just believe it man
[1:23:09] it does not it does not matter what it
[1:23:12] sounds like it does not matter what it
[1:23:15] looks like
[1:23:18] reasoning is where what got even trouble
[1:23:21] you do not reason with this word God
[1:23:25] does not need a church to reason the
[1:23:27] word he wants a church to believe the
[1:23:30] word thank you brother
[1:23:34] he said you've got to take it just as it
[1:23:39] is
[1:23:40] it needs no interpretation
[1:23:48] there was a brother in our area I hope
[1:23:50] it's okay I'm just I feel free tonight
[1:23:52] okay
[1:23:53] there was a brother in our area that he
[1:23:55] he got up and he preached and he said
[1:23:57] now brother Branham talked about the
[1:23:59] white dog and the black dog
[1:24:01] right
[1:24:02] which one you feed the most that's the
[1:24:05] one that wins
[1:24:06] he said and he said that was Paul after
[1:24:08] his conversion he said but that couldn't
[1:24:09] be right
[1:24:12] he said you don't have a black dog after
[1:24:14] your conversion
[1:24:17] so he begins to tell his thoughts on
[1:24:20] this thing you know
[1:24:21] and I thought my isn't that something
[1:24:24] Romans 7
[1:24:27] was before Paul's conversion
[1:24:31] so I got to looking
[1:24:33] and brother Brandon said to y l Moody
[1:24:37] was reading Romans chapter 7. that's
[1:24:40] right
[1:24:41] and I think about Dwight Moody as being
[1:24:43] a man that maybe in his heart he was
[1:24:45] right
[1:24:46] but he was struggling with the flesh
[1:24:47] nature
[1:24:49] but brother Branham said when the white
[1:24:52] Moody read Romans 7 that he ran out into
[1:24:55] the streets screaming
[1:24:58] do you know Grace
[1:25:00] Amazing Grace and I asked the church
[1:25:03] back home I said how could a man see
[1:25:06] grace if he wasn't converted yet it
[1:25:09] worse after Paul's conversion see it may
[1:25:13] not look right to your mind but just
[1:25:15] believe it
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:17] foreign
[1:25:23] the Bible says that
[1:25:25] the word of God is of no private
[1:25:27] interpretation
[1:25:28] God don't need any of our schools to
[1:25:31] interpret his word
[1:25:32] when he vindicates it it makes it live
[1:25:35] that's the interpretation of it
[1:25:39] and I told our church back home I don't
[1:25:41] see the picture here but we got the
[1:25:43] picture brother Branham with a pillar of
[1:25:45] fire over his head
[1:25:47] and I said you know people could ask why
[1:25:49] do we have a picture of brother Branham
[1:25:50] in our church and I said we don't
[1:25:54] Hallelujah
[1:25:58] we didn't get the picture
[1:26:00] of brother Bynum
[1:26:03] we don't put up pictures of dead men in
[1:26:04] the church
[1:26:06] come on thanks
[1:26:08] [Music]
[1:26:10] but we live in an hour where
[1:26:12] everything's political right
[1:26:16] Joe Biden
[1:26:18] he wanted he wanted everyone to know
[1:26:20] that Obama supported him
[1:26:23] you know if the Republican men that are
[1:26:25] running profits they want them to know
[1:26:26] they want everybody to know Donald Trump
[1:26:28] supports me and so what do they do they
[1:26:29] get their picture taken with them sure
[1:26:32] and when a man gets his picture taken
[1:26:34] with someone in a political rally
[1:26:37] it says I back this man that's right
[1:26:40] and so brother Burnham said I was so
[1:26:42] honored
[1:26:44] God let me get my picture made with him
[1:26:49] so God says
[1:26:52] let you have this picture so that you
[1:26:55] will know I'm backing the ministry of
[1:26:58] this man
[1:27:00] that's right in the political Arena they
[1:27:04] put their hand on their shoulder and
[1:27:06] they say I'm backing him and there it
[1:27:09] looked like a cloud the scripture said
[1:27:11] the size of a man's hand and over
[1:27:14] brother Braden said was a hand it was a
[1:27:17] Halo and he says I back this ministry
[1:27:22] let me tell you something until another
[1:27:25] preacher gets that picture over his head
[1:27:27] I say cursed be the man that preaches
[1:27:30] anything other Paul said if they preach
[1:27:33] anything other than what I have preached
[1:27:36] let them be a curse
[1:27:40] [Applause]
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:49] brother Branham says
[1:27:51] he said that Reverend best he wanted to
[1:27:54] debate brother Branham
[1:27:55] and prove him to be false
[1:28:00] when he agreed to it Reverend Beth said
[1:28:02] this he said go down and take six
[1:28:04] glosses of me
[1:28:06] while I go down and skin that old man
[1:28:09] I'm going to skin him and rub salt on
[1:28:13] his hide and Tack it up on my door for a
[1:28:16] memorial to Divine Healing
[1:28:20] this is what Reverend best thought about
[1:28:22] brother Branham right so brother bass he
[1:28:26] begins to denounce brother Branham as a
[1:28:28] Healer
[1:28:30] and what did the scripture say agree
[1:28:31] with your adversary quickly
[1:28:33] so brother Brandon Walks to the pulpit
[1:28:35] and he says he's right I'm not a Healer
[1:28:38] he said I'm no more a Healer brother
[1:28:40] best than you are a savior
[1:28:43] that's right
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:46] but I like this
[1:28:48] he was told to take six pictures
[1:28:52] six is the number of a man
[1:28:55] but the photographer took seven of them
[1:28:59] and the first six did not develop
[1:29:02] but only the only the seventh
[1:29:06] wasn't a Divine Vindication of where the
[1:29:11] word was standing
[1:29:13] [Applause]
[1:29:17] not like this
[1:29:18] the picture was sent to the FBI and this
[1:29:21] is what George J Lacey said he said
[1:29:23] based up only above described
[1:29:26] examination and study I am of the
[1:29:29] definite opinion that the negative
[1:29:31] submitted for examination was not
[1:29:34] retouched and I want to say to you the
[1:29:37] word does not need to be retouched
[1:29:41] that's right man he said nor was it a
[1:29:44] composite nor a double exposure negative
[1:29:49] god brother Brandon said God makes
[1:29:51] science back up the word
[1:29:53] that's right George Taylor said this
[1:29:55] further I am of the definite opinion
[1:29:58] that the light streak
[1:30:01] appearing above the Halo was caused by
[1:30:05] the Light
[1:30:06] not a lot
[1:30:08] he said it was caused by the Light
[1:30:11] striking the negative
[1:30:13] even science said what was in the
[1:30:16] picture was the light
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:22] I found I found this later on
[1:30:25] there was a news conference and George J
[1:30:28] Lacey was asked to speak about that
[1:30:29] picture
[1:30:30] and he said to my knowledge this is the
[1:30:33] first time in all the world's history
[1:30:35] that a supernatural being has been
[1:30:38] photographed and scientifically
[1:30:41] Vindicated
[1:30:42] Mr Lacy added Reverend Branham you will
[1:30:46] die like all other Mortals but as long
[1:30:50] as there is a Christian civilization
[1:30:52] your picture will live on
[1:30:56] I don't want you to understand when
[1:30:59] people begin to leave the message they
[1:31:01] start taking down the pictures of the
[1:31:04] prophets
[1:31:08] George J Lacey said that the picture on
[1:31:11] the wall is representation of a
[1:31:14] Christian civilization
[1:31:21] watch this when men begin to turn away
[1:31:23] from the message they begin to pull the
[1:31:26] pictures down and it is proof that they
[1:31:28] are turning away from Christianity
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:34] praise the Lord the picture
[1:31:38] is proof
[1:31:39] of a Christian civilization
[1:31:42] let me go to the next verse I stop there
[1:31:46] he said known this no Prophecy of the
[1:31:47] scriptures of any Divine interpretation
[1:31:49] that's right
[1:31:50] for the prophecy
[1:31:52] came not in Old Time by the will of man
[1:31:56] but holy men of God
[1:31:59] speak as they were moved by the Holy
[1:32:02] Ghost
[1:32:03] and that when you read this in the Greek
[1:32:05] Lexicon it says it this way no prophecy
[1:32:08] has ever come that was by human will it
[1:32:12] was not the will of man it was not the
[1:32:14] thought of man but this word that we
[1:32:17] have is the very word the very essence
[1:32:20] of Jesus Christ himself
[1:32:26] we have
[1:32:27] a sure word of Prophecy
[1:32:32] the word sure means
[1:32:36] in the Greek it says to walk
[1:32:39] where it is solid
[1:32:43] brother Jordan if I got a quote it's
[1:32:45] solid
[1:32:48] I'll just share this with you I was
[1:32:50] talking to a I was preaching at a church
[1:32:52] and I I ministered about the pastor
[1:32:54] being the headship of the local assembly
[1:32:57] and a lady comes to me after church and
[1:32:58] she said I don't I don't like that
[1:33:02] and I said well it's a quote
[1:33:05] sure so I read her the quote
[1:33:08] and she said that's just one quote
[1:33:11] I said well let me read you another one
[1:33:14] so I read another one
[1:33:16] and she said that's just two quotes
[1:33:20] I said do you want to know what two
[1:33:22] quotes from my Prophet is
[1:33:25] it's one more than he had to say
[1:33:29] one is enough for me
[1:33:31] let me tell you something if he said it
[1:33:33] I believe it
[1:33:35] it settles the matter
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:39] to walk where it is solid
[1:33:42] the word sure means firm
[1:33:45] it means unshakable
[1:33:48] absolutely dependable
[1:33:52] or giving guaranteed support
[1:33:56] it means worthy of confidence
[1:33:59] because it is based on a solid footing
[1:34:06] as I prepare to close tonight
[1:34:08] just want to say that
[1:34:11] one time the scripture said all the
[1:34:14] people shall rejoice
[1:34:15] when they shall see the plummet
[1:34:17] it's in the hand of the river Bell
[1:34:21] now brother Branham tells us that
[1:34:22] cerebral Bell topped Christ
[1:34:24] but I want you to notice something when
[1:34:27] you hold a plummet in your hand you can
[1:34:29] put it on a string or whatever you want
[1:34:30] you hold it up it stays exactly straight
[1:34:33] all the way down that's right and so you
[1:34:35] understand that even though Paul
[1:34:37] preached he preached along with where
[1:34:39] that plummet stayed and so we come down
[1:34:42] to the solid footing and the revelation
[1:34:45] of Malachi chapter 4. watch what brother
[1:34:48] Branham always said he said I preach
[1:34:51] what Paul freaks
[1:34:54] the plummet was not in the handle of the
[1:34:57] Branham and the plummet was not in the
[1:34:59] hand of Paul but Christ himself held the
[1:35:03] plummet and Paul lined up an irania
[1:35:06] signed up seven Church eight Messengers
[1:35:09] lined up so what do we line up to the
[1:35:12] word of the hour and when we line up we
[1:35:15] can look all the way back to the book of
[1:35:18] Acts this is the planet this is the word
[1:35:23] and it is the proper channel of
[1:35:26] Revelation would you stand your feet
[1:35:28] with me
[1:35:30] praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus
[1:35:34] thank you
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:37] Hallelujah the rest of what it says
[1:35:39] about sure in the Greek it says it is
[1:35:41] worthy of confidence
[1:35:43] because it is on a solid footing
[1:35:45] therefore it is fully secure and
[1:35:49] therefore can be trusted to give full
[1:35:51] support
[1:35:54] I want you to know if you don't hear
[1:35:56] another thing I say
[1:35:58] I want you to hear
[1:36:00] and let the world know
[1:36:02] cliff farmer is in full support of the
[1:36:08] message of Malachi 4.
[1:36:14] and if you deviate one word from that I
[1:36:18] am not in support
[1:36:20] if you deviate one idea or one thought I
[1:36:24] am no longer in support but if we stay
[1:36:27] with the message what is God coming for
[1:36:30] brother Berlin said Christ is coming for
[1:36:33] his word and if we line up with the word
[1:36:36] and we feed on the word we become the
[1:36:39] word and become the rapture
[1:36:42] Hallelujah
[1:36:43] [Music]

[1:57:59] and now I see
[1:58:02] you know he taught on the channel of
[1:58:05] inspiration
[1:58:06] he said that was what job
[1:58:09] the friends of job was lacking because
[1:58:12] they did not know the channel of
[1:58:13] inspiration for the other day so they
[1:58:16] came with the idea to argue with job
[1:58:19] what they thought was right what they
[1:58:21] thought was his problem because they did
[1:58:24] not know the channel of inspiration
[1:58:26] praise the Lord whatever God was doing
[1:58:29] he had a China that's the reason why he
[1:58:31] never choose no other man
[1:58:33] to rape him of all his goods and and
[1:58:36] affect his body
[1:58:38] because job was that channel of
[1:58:40] inspiration

[1:59:44] Spirit came true tonight amen praise the
[1:59:47] Lord we thank God that the Holy Spirit
[1:59:49] came true tonight because I was not even
