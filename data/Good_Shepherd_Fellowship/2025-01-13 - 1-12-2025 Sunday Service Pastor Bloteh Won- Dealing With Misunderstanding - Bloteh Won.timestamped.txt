[56:38] Wednesday night strangely after the
[56:41] prayer meeting we got into we got into a
[56:44] subject and uh uh and then it couldn't
[56:48] leave my mind so this morning I'm going
[56:51] to continue from where we stop amen
[56:53] Wednesday night we were looking at uh uh
[56:56] just after uh we we got praying done
[57:00] praying for the little exhortation we
[57:03] spoke about uh a sense of dealing with
[57:06] misunderstanding but we just read read a
[57:09] scripture and read a quote concerning
[57:11] hegen and uh uh uh when the little child
[57:16] ishmail was crying and um Sarah had to P
[57:21] hagga out and all of there that was what
[57:23] we spoke on uh uh on on Wednesday night
[57:28] praise the
[57:29] Lord and uh
[57:33] uh sorry let me just take
[57:38] um this was this was what we read a
[57:41] little bit and I
[57:43] think uh of the remembrance of the
[57:48] Lord again at a place of
[57:51] refreshment in The Well of uh be her
[57:57] which means in the Hebrew a well of him
[57:59] that liveth in serth mean heg
[58:04] misunderstood yet in the line of duty
[58:07] misunderstood Miss George she was cast
[58:12] out with no place to go with a perishing
[58:16] child and the water was spin in the
[58:21] bottle so that's what we were looking at
[58:23] Hegel was uh in the situation she was uh
[58:27] she was cast out by
[58:29] Sarah and uh uh so we in a sense we were
[58:33] looking a little bit of how do we deal
[58:36] with misunderstanding how do we deal
[58:39] with misunderstanding how do we deal
[58:41] when we feel like we've been misjudged
[58:44] how do we handle it how do we deal with
[58:46] it and I want to continue a little bit
[58:49] and and and as I was uh uh studying I
[58:53] was looking through my notes I preach uh
[58:56] this message dealing with
[58:57] misunderstanding back uh April 4th uh n
[59:02] uh uh
[59:03] 2014 right in this
[59:05] church
[59:07] so it's hard for you to remember what
[59:10] happened that
[59:12] day so it's a good thing that it has
[59:17] been over 10 years so I can preach it
[59:22] again I can preach it again but I'm
[59:25] going I will go in a different in
[59:26] different direction uh I was I was
[59:28] looking through my notes I knew that uh
[59:31] I've spoken of something like this
[59:32] before and and the did came up uh April
[59:35] 6
[59:39] 2014 so but uh this is a new day amen
[59:43] this is a new day so we want to look at
[59:45] this subject of uh uh dealing with
[59:51] misunderstanding when you being
[59:54] misjudged how do we handle it
[59:56] praise the Lord how do you how do we
[1:00:00] handle it and uh I was looking at
[1:00:06] uh that a little bit last night and I
[1:00:09] was just
[1:00:12] thinking and I think the reason we are
[1:00:18] misunderstood and we misunderstand one
[1:00:21] another is because
[1:00:26] we are peculiar
[1:00:31] people praise the Lord you will soon
[1:00:34] understand what I mean by that but the
[1:00:36] reason
[1:00:38] why we are misunderstood and we
[1:00:41] misunderstand people is because we are
[1:00:44] all peculiar
[1:00:46] people we are all peculiar
[1:00:50] people and uh and in that same regard
[1:00:58] misunderstanding is the greatest
[1:01:02] evil the greatest
[1:01:05] evil the greatest evil is that we all
[1:01:09] want to be
[1:01:13] understood and never want to understand
[1:01:18] others we all want to be
[1:01:23] understood praise the Lord
[1:01:26] but the patient the grace of
[1:01:31] understanding others we don't have
[1:01:34] it but we want people to understand us
[1:01:38] right you want I want I want you this
[1:01:41] morning to understand what I'm
[1:01:45] saying praise the
[1:01:47] Lord but then I have to bear with you
[1:01:50] and realize that you might not
[1:01:52] understand what I'm saying you might be
[1:01:54] so occupied in your mind that your body
[1:01:57] is just here and your mind is somewhere
[1:02:01] else I must I must I must come to that F
[1:02:04] so when when uh when I feel uh the
[1:02:08] spirit of uh uh distraction or
[1:02:11] resentment that a preacher must come to
[1:02:13] that f i I should I should come to the
[1:02:16] place where I'm I'm I'm not frustrated
[1:02:18] over
[1:02:21] it just as much as I want you to
[1:02:25] understand my message I want you to
[1:02:27] understand that when I take longer time
[1:02:30] to
[1:02:32] preach I want you to understand there
[1:02:36] too because that is the greatest evil we
[1:02:40] all want to be
[1:02:41] understood but the grace impatient of
[1:02:44] understanding one another we don't want
[1:02:46] it we don't want to exercise it
[1:02:52] right and I mean that's why we have the
[1:02:55] problem that we we have in in in I mean
[1:02:58] in our lives in in our homes
[1:03:01] relationship and uh uh even at work
[1:03:04] dealing with people you know uh if you
[1:03:09] don't realize that and put in the time
[1:03:13] because there is no two person the
[1:03:17] same there is no two person the
[1:03:21] same we are all
[1:03:24] peculiar amen and the word peculiar is
[1:03:27] so
[1:03:30] profound that we travel a little bit and
[1:03:32] look at that in the in the
[1:03:36] scripture praise the
[1:03:44] Lord are we together are you okay are
[1:03:47] you going to make effort to understand
[1:03:48] me praise the
[1:03:53] Lord don't know
[1:03:56] don't get so quick to be mad at me
[1:04:01] amen I I say some things that you don't
[1:04:03] agree with but uh just just say why he
[1:04:08] said it where is he coming
[1:04:10] from because if you don't understand me
[1:04:12] you might just take it that I'm
[1:04:14] attacking you that's why you might take
[1:04:16] it to
[1:04:19] be young man how are you good
[1:04:24] good are we together
[1:04:27] amen so I call that the great evil of
[1:04:30] the word we all want to be understood
[1:04:33] and never want to make the time and uh
[1:04:36] to understand one another we don't want
[1:04:38] to put in that and that is the reason
[1:04:41] why we Face a lot a lot a lot of problem
[1:04:44] I mean most most especially when you get
[1:04:46] down into our family problem most of the
[1:04:50] the divorces is just
[1:04:52] because she's not understanding me and
[1:04:56] she said he's not understanding
[1:04:59] me praise the
[1:05:02] Lord I want her to understand
[1:05:06] me and on the other side she say I want
[1:05:09] him to understand
[1:05:18] me are we together
[1:05:28] so we going to travel a little bit but
[1:05:30] let's let's look at this word let's look
[1:05:33] at this word
[1:05:38] peculiar from the
[1:05:41] Hebrew the word has a
[1:05:45] name SES
[1:05:48] GLA that's that's the Hebrew name I know
[1:05:51] I'm slaughtering the word because uh uh
[1:05:56] with with all the asent on top the
[1:05:58] there's a way your tongue must be able
[1:06:00] to carry it but trying to pronounce it
[1:06:03] the best that I
[1:06:05] can this
[1:06:14] word the concordant said the uh biblical
[1:06:18] concordant said is a feminine
[1:06:22] passive participle of an unus use root
[1:06:28] meaning it means shut up something that
[1:06:33] is
[1:06:36] covered something that is
[1:06:41] closed something that is
[1:06:45] hidden you see the reason why we must
[1:06:47] make effort to understand is because you
[1:06:52] are looking at mean year but the real me
[1:06:55] is hidden behind this flesh
[1:06:58] amen
[1:07:02] amen you says I know him he's uh he's
[1:07:06] 5'6 you know uh he's uh you know he's
[1:07:09] have funny glasses on his face and you
[1:07:11] know and I mean that just what you see
[1:07:15] you really don't know
[1:07:21] me it's from uh um
[1:07:26] I'm going use root word to shut
[1:07:29] up it also means
[1:07:33] wealth it also mean we
[1:07:36] wealth as closely shut up it means a uh
[1:07:40] a
[1:07:41] jewer
[1:07:44] diamond
[1:07:45] gold so it give you the
[1:07:49] sense of why precious stones are
[1:07:53] peculiar because you just can't go on
[1:07:56] the road and find it you can't just walk
[1:07:59] on the road and find
[1:08:01] diamond
[1:08:03] no they are hidden in the
[1:08:09] earth that's what makes it peculiar
[1:08:12] because it's not commonly seen it's
[1:08:14] hidden in the
[1:08:20] earth praise the
[1:08:23] Lord I won't I can uh remember uh uh uh
[1:08:28] uh a great little story that is told of
[1:08:32] uh uh one of uh the word great boxer
[1:08:36] muhamed Ali it says there you know his
[1:08:39] daughter was coming to see him and uh
[1:08:42] you know going to see her her daddy she
[1:08:45] kind of her dress up you know like a
[1:08:47] like a teenager would dress or the young
[1:08:50] you know W and with all all faction
[1:08:54] thing and shut blast and shot you know
[1:08:57] and all of that and then he uh talked to
[1:09:01] his daughter and said to her and said uh
[1:09:04] said
[1:09:06] honey you know
[1:09:10] why
[1:09:12] uh you know how they get
[1:09:15] diamonds she said no she says well you
[1:09:18] know they uh there are people that that
[1:09:20] that go and look for it they explore the
[1:09:23] Earth they dig the Earth you know and
[1:09:26] and they take out the diamonds and then
[1:09:28] uh you know and then they have to wash
[1:09:30] the rocks to be able to find the diamond
[1:09:33] and he was telling her in the sense that
[1:09:36] things that are
[1:09:38] precious things that are valuable you
[1:09:42] just don't expose them like that being
[1:09:45] the father he was trying to bring a wise
[1:09:47] counsel to his daughter he did not
[1:09:49] appreciate the way she
[1:09:51] dressed but he was trying to say it in a
[1:09:54] way that she will appreciate it instead
[1:09:57] of being
[1:10:02] offended praise the Lord
[1:10:05] amen and uh I mean the society just get
[1:10:09] the whole thing outside down and it's
[1:10:11] just so crazy you know well uh you see
[1:10:14] you know guys who will will love their
[1:10:17] wives to be pretty much naked and they
[1:10:20] be walking so everybody can see see see

[1:10:30] she must be only for you she's
[1:10:34] cover if she's peculiar she's
[1:10:38] cover that's what the word peculiar
[1:10:41] means something that is shut up is
[1:10:45] closely
[1:10:51] hidden a
[1:10:52] treasure a proper ghost
[1:10:59] special that's what the word peculiar
[1:11:03] means now God will speak
[1:11:08] to to uh Israel Exodus chapter 19 if we
[1:11:13] want to get there quickly Exodus chapter
[1:11:17] 19 I'll take you through a little drill
[1:11:20] here like I said try to understand me uh
[1:11:24] I'm I'm
[1:11:31] praise the
[1:11:34] lord it's like two guys talking and the
[1:11:37] guy says you are not understanding me he
[1:11:40] says I understood what you said he says
[1:11:41] okay what was I going to say you just
[1:11:44] said that you came from the place and uh
[1:11:47] and uh and uh and you never allow the
[1:11:51] guy to finish how did you say you
[1:11:53] understand him
[1:11:56] praise the Lord amen Exodus chapter
[1:12:00] 19 God speaks to Israel here in Exodus
[1:12:04] chapter
[1:12:08] 19 and this this is a very this is a
[1:12:11] very the uh uh wonderful chapter
[1:12:18] here M let's read uh from verse uh four
[1:12:23] verse three and Moses went up unto God
[1:12:27] and the Lord called unto him out of the
[1:12:30] mountain saying th thus shall th say to
[1:12:34] the house of Jacob and tell the children
[1:12:36] of Israel ye have seen what I did unto
[1:12:39] the Egyptian and how I be you on Eagle
[1:12:42] wings and brought you to
[1:12:46] myself praise the Lord now therefore if
[1:12:50] ye will obey my voice in the and keep my
[1:12:54] C
[1:12:56] then ye shall be a peculiar treasure
[1:13:00] unto me above all people for
[1:13:05] all the Earth is mine praise the Lord
[1:13:09] now when you read this in the way that
[1:13:12] we will understand it like we understand
[1:13:14] English keep that verse up for me please
[1:13:17] the way we will understand it like we
[1:13:19] understand English if ye obey my voice
[1:13:24] which mean God God is requiring the
[1:13:26] people to and and and if you keep my
[1:13:31] Covenant then if you do this then you
[1:13:35] will become
[1:13:36] this praise the Lord that's the way we
[1:13:39] will understand it that's the way it
[1:13:42] appears but that's not really what it
[1:13:47] is I'll show I'll show you why I say
[1:13:50] that's not what it is praise the Lord
[1:13:54] amen because what will happen right here
[1:13:58] in Exodus chapter 19 is that this is the
[1:14:02] place where the people choose law
[1:14:05] instead of Grace right this is where
[1:14:08] Israel made their filter mistake this is
[1:14:11] the chapter where they said everything
[1:14:13] that God said we will
[1:14:15] do that's this is where the Lord was
[1:14:18] introduced now
[1:14:20] because because they did not understood
[1:14:24] what he say here just like I'm saying we
[1:14:28] don't understand it because in the way
[1:14:30] it appears the way we read English in
[1:14:33] our understanding we will understand
[1:14:35] that God is requiring us to obey his
[1:14:38] voice he requiring us to keep his
[1:14:41] commandment now even if you look at this
[1:14:44] fact the Commandments is not given how
[1:14:48] can he tell them to keep his
[1:14:50] commandment the Commandment is given in
[1:14:53] chapter 20 right
[1:14:56] that's right so is God requiring them
[1:14:58] something or is it something he's trying
[1:15:01] to tell them that they are not patient
[1:15:04] to
[1:15:08] listen and they came quickly and said
[1:15:10] everything that he said we would
[1:15:17] do praise the Lord
[1:15:26] I heard a
[1:15:29] story from
[1:15:33] uh a great preacher he went to be with
[1:15:37] the
[1:15:39] Lord and
[1:15:41] uh he told this little story of a man
[1:15:44] that went uh you know travel over to
[1:15:47] China went to a
[1:15:49] restaurant supposed to be in an
[1:15:51] international restaurant he went to eat
[1:15:54] and then uh
[1:15:57] uh after he was sitting down bed and you
[1:16:01] know give the
[1:16:03] man
[1:16:04] um $100 or so a Big Bill and he was
[1:16:12] waiting and you know in those kind of
[1:16:14] restaurant they try to get people that
[1:16:16] speaks a little bit of
[1:16:18] English and when he started asking the
[1:16:21] guy for his change
[1:16:25] he says he says where's he says where's
[1:16:28] my change every time the guy come around
[1:16:29] he says where's my change you know and
[1:16:31] the guy told
[1:16:34] him you know and uh because sometimes he
[1:16:39] he was trying to process what this guy
[1:16:41] was saying you know his little bit of
[1:16:44] English he was trying to bring it
[1:16:46] together so but he captured the word
[1:16:49] change and you know the the Chinese
[1:16:55] uh uh education teaches that change
[1:17:00] comes from
[1:17:03] within
[1:17:06] so
[1:17:08] so the Chinese man taught he say where
[1:17:11] is
[1:17:13] change with a little
[1:17:15] English you know so he he just change
[1:17:20] comes from with
[1:17:23] being you know he thought that he didn't
[1:17:25] wanted to embarrass the man so he just
[1:17:28] went to his ear and Whisper change comes
[1:17:31] from
[1:17:33] within but he
[1:17:36] misunderstood you see
[1:17:39] and that's the picture
[1:17:41] you
[1:17:43] because there is more to this that God
[1:17:46] is saying than what the people
[1:17:51] understand are we
[1:17:53] together okay I could stay on this the
[1:17:55] rest of the the evening Deuteronomy
[1:17:58] chapter
[1:17:59] 14 let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 14
[1:18:27] now
[1:18:28] so when you look at
[1:18:31] this theonomy
[1:18:33] 14 you will see here let's read verse
[1:18:36] one and two ye are the children of of
[1:18:41] the Lord your
[1:18:42] God ye shall NE cut yourself not make
[1:18:46] any bance between your eyes for the day
[1:18:50] for thou are Unholy people unto the Lord
[1:18:55] and the Lord has chosen thee To Be A
[1:19:00] peculiar people now if you know the
[1:19:02] setting of Deuteronomy is that this was
[1:19:06] almost Moses last message to the people
[1:19:09] before he will leave them now this was
[1:19:12] the same Moses that just spoke to the
[1:19:15] people uh after the Red Sea Exodus
[1:19:19] chapter 19 was just after the cross the
[1:19:22] Red Sea in Exodus 14
[1:19:26] praise the Lord now here is Moses now
[1:19:29] speaking to the people just before he
[1:19:32] will leave them but here his language
[1:19:36] changed a little bit he's not telling
[1:19:39] them that if you will obey my
[1:19:43] voice because definitely we know that
[1:19:45] the people did not obey the voice of
[1:19:48] God for the 40 years that they were in
[1:19:51] the wilderness until
[1:19:55] I mean they put so much pressure on
[1:19:57] Moses until the Lord is not going to
[1:20:00] allow him to go into the promised land
[1:20:02] he's giving them his last word but it
[1:20:05] looks like he's bringing out the picture
[1:20:08] more clearer than he said it in the
[1:20:11] beginning are we together amen amen yeah
[1:20:16] he's not telling the people if thou will
[1:20:18] obey my voice if thou will keep my
[1:20:20] commandment he's saying to the people
[1:20:23] for thou are you are a holy people unto
[1:20:26] the Lord you are a choosing people
[1:20:29] you've been choosing to be a peculiar
[1:20:32] people unto him above all the nations
[1:20:36] that are that are upon the
[1:20:39] Earth you know so he's bringing this out
[1:20:41] he's trying to make them to know you are
[1:20:44] a peculiar
[1:20:48] people are we together amen and you will
[1:20:52] see that that thought travel alone and
[1:20:55] and and over in the New Testament you'll
[1:20:58] find that Titus said the same thing to
[1:21:00] his church you find that Peter said the
[1:21:03] same thing in his gospel you are a
[1:21:05] chosen generation you are a peculiar
[1:21:08] people you know he he keeps saying it to
[1:21:11] to uh uh to the people so you realize
[1:21:15] that uh uh uh and even when we read
[1:21:21] Psalm chapter 106 the Bible say that
[1:21:25] that was the same thing with the people
[1:21:26] they did not understand they never
[1:21:29] understood what God was
[1:21:31] doing they never understood the Lord
[1:21:34] what he was
[1:21:35] doing it's also because God is
[1:21:39] peculiar we have a peculiar God that has
[1:21:42] a peculiar
[1:21:44] people praise the Lord amen amen but you
[1:21:48] see the problem the the I mean the the
[1:21:50] the the the the thing here is that God
[1:21:54] don't need to understand us because he
[1:21:56] made
[1:21:58] us he factioned
[1:22:03] us
[1:22:06] amen our our the thing characters that
[1:22:09] we have that make us different from one
[1:22:12] another he gave us those unique
[1:22:16] identification and so much that the
[1:22:19] Bible says he put a number to every
[1:22:22] strain of our head he number our head
[1:22:26] that's how detailed he
[1:22:33] is are we together so you see that is
[1:22:38] the reason that's the reason
[1:22:41] why misunderstanding is such an
[1:22:44] issue because the person that you uh
[1:22:48] trying to understand you never made
[1:22:52] him praise the Lord amen amen
[1:22:56] amen there was a story also about uh you
[1:22:59] know the guy that was driving a h a fall
[1:23:02] vehicle it broke down down the road and
[1:23:05] this gentleman came and just pull his
[1:23:07] card he said what's wrong he said well I
[1:23:09] I you know I been driving this vehicle
[1:23:11] he says okay take it easy tell me what's
[1:23:14] the problem you know he explained and
[1:23:16] after saying the guy just went there he
[1:23:19] says how did you know he said I made it
[1:23:21] I put it together
[1:23:24] I work with General
[1:23:26] motive I designed this
[1:23:29] vehicle just tell me what the issue I
[1:23:31] can fix
[1:23:34] it and that's the same thing with God he
[1:23:37] desire
[1:23:38] you praise the Lord he knows exactly
[1:23:42] where your problem is he knows exactly
[1:23:45] what to touch and your life will never
[1:23:47] be the
[1:23:49] same you trying everything but he knows
[1:23:52] exactly what he can turn around and your
[1:23:55] life will never be the
[1:24:06] same are we
[1:24:12] together I have this I have this bunch
[1:24:15] of things that I wanted to bring to you
[1:24:17] this
[1:24:18] morning and uh
[1:24:22] uh in in the way that uh you know
[1:24:26] we we uh we deal with one another and
[1:24:31] all of that and and you know our our
[1:24:33] requirement to one another you know
[1:24:42] yeah that's the reason that's the reason
[1:24:45] uh you know we have all of our our
[1:24:48] differences and and um you know divorce
[1:24:52] cases in the word and and uh all
[1:24:55] because
[1:24:57] of uh unforgiving
[1:25:00] spirit the ability to put things under
[1:25:02] the blood and that that is not given to
[1:25:06] everybody and that ability is only given
[1:25:09] to them that are cleansed by that blood
[1:25:13] they are redeemed they have acces praise
[1:25:16] the Lord but what I what I wanted for us
[1:25:19] to look at is uh you know uh uh
[1:25:26] I try to go through it quickly or El I
[1:25:28] could I could just um Rong what I want
[1:25:31] to share with you this
[1:25:33] morning there are some there are some
[1:25:36] responsibility you know this this is
[1:25:37] something that I I pick up one time just
[1:25:40] looking through the scripture sometimes
[1:25:41] I do that you know I just I just take a
[1:25:45] verse take a phrase and run it through
[1:25:47] the scripture and just see you know how
[1:25:49] much the Bible put emphasis on it yeah
[1:25:52] what I was looking at is the emphasis
[1:25:54] the Bible put on one and one another one
[1:25:58] another how how how much the Bible
[1:26:01] especially to the New Testament Church
[1:26:04] the scripture put emphasis on our
[1:26:07] responsibility to one
[1:26:11] another praise the Lord our
[1:26:14] responsibility to one another just like
[1:26:17] we're talking about understanding
[1:26:19] dealing with
[1:26:21] understanding you know there is no way
[1:26:23] you can sit to yourself and by yourself
[1:26:27] and think you will understand me no you
[1:26:31] will just be coming up with Illusions in
[1:26:34] your mind you be coming up with things
[1:26:36] in your
[1:26:37] mind praise the Lord amen there is no
[1:26:42] way because if I don't tell you I have a
[1:26:45] cross eye there is no way you know I
[1:26:46] have a cross
[1:26:50] eye so there I mean there is just no way
[1:26:54] so for you to be able to understand me
[1:26:57] or for me to be able to understand you
[1:27:00] we have to make some effort there are
[1:27:03] some things that we must do nature make
[1:27:07] us responsible that
[1:27:09] way we must be able to fellowship with
[1:27:13] one another we must talk with one
[1:27:14] another we must we must be able to uh H
[1:27:17] uh I mean spend some time even if it's
[1:27:19] just a little time and all of those
[1:27:21] things develop the interest that we have
[1:27:24] in understanding one another now our
[1:27:26] responsibility to one another uh uh St
[1:27:29] John Chapter 13 uh uh there Jesus speaks
[1:27:34] about watching one another feed in St
[1:27:36] John 15:17 he talks about uh uh uh love
[1:27:42] one another he says this is the
[1:27:43] Commandment I have given you that you
[1:27:45] love one another praise the Lord
[1:27:49] amen and uh in Romans chapter 12 thing
[1:27:53] the Bible says we must prefer one
[1:27:57] another are we
[1:28:00] together and you see this is the is the
[1:28:03] lack of these things the lack of fa
[1:28:07] that's what create this problem of
[1:28:14] misunderstanding are we
[1:28:16] together the lack of
[1:28:20] it I'm trying to make it simple again
[1:28:22] I'm trying to make myself I'm doing the
[1:28:25] best I can so you can understand me you
[1:28:28] buy the
[1:28:29] vehicle you love the vehicle but yet the
[1:28:32] vehicle comes with a
[1:28:35] manual that tells you how every part on
[1:28:39] that vehicle operate you fall in love
[1:28:42] with the vehicle so much you say you
[1:28:45] love it and you never spend time to look
[1:28:49] in the
[1:28:51] menu pretty soon what is going to happen
[1:28:54] that vehicle you love you're going to
[1:28:56] sit down right inside and says I'm a
[1:28:58] frustrated with this
[1:29:03] vehicle what's
[1:29:06] wrong and sometime nothing wrong the
[1:29:09] only thing wrong there is that you never
[1:29:11] took time to read the
[1:29:14] manual I don't I don't even know how to
[1:29:16] wind the but the windows
[1:29:19] down oh my God how how how do I even put
[1:29:23] the heat on
[1:29:26] that's the reason why it comes with a
[1:29:29] manual so the problem is not the vehicle
[1:29:32] the problem is
[1:29:38] you you're frustrated you you're
[1:29:40] knocking all things down and and say why
[1:29:44] because you saw the vehicle you like it
[1:29:46] you know what and and and you all you
[1:29:49] want is just jump inside and press the
[1:29:51] speed and everything and now taking time
[1:29:54] to be able to read the manual of the
[1:29:57] vehicle you soon get
[1:30:03] frustrated but you sit right
[1:30:06] there and you come you slam the door you
[1:30:08] go in you take it take the book and you
[1:30:12] you go through you said that little
[1:30:15] bu right in the middle
[1:30:17] there if you touch
[1:30:21] it uh it's for snow
[1:30:25] it locks the whe of your
[1:30:27] vehicle and uh you can drive it like
[1:30:30] it's a four wheed and what you say oh
[1:30:33] wow oh wow it's a all we oh wow I love
[1:30:41] it praise the Lord amen but if you never
[1:30:44] read it you don't know how it works the
[1:30:47] vehicle is spinning around oh my God oh
[1:30:49] my God oh my
[1:30:51] God this vehicle will kill me
[1:30:55] no it won't kill you you will kill
[1:31:00] yourself praise the Lord you will kill
[1:31:03] yourself why because you are not making
[1:31:06] time to understand the thing you
[1:31:09] love the thing you love you took your
[1:31:12] money to go and buy you are not making
[1:31:14] time to understand how it works
[1:31:24] you see so the scripture says
[1:31:28] here thatth we must prefer one
[1:31:32] another uh be of the same mind to one
[1:31:36] another that Romans chapter 12 and uh uh
[1:31:40] Paul here in Romans 14 said do not judge
[1:31:43] one another praise the
[1:31:46] Lord because the reason why we judge one
[1:31:49] another is because you don't understand
[1:31:52] what that person is going through
[1:31:54] right it's just because of
[1:31:56] misunderstanding misunderstanding is the
[1:32:00] base of all the most of our
[1:32:04] problem praise the Lorden amen if
[1:32:07] misunderstanding is not a problem then

[1:34:50] God has only one Temple right only one
[1:34:55] temple in the actual sense you are just
[1:34:59] a piece of that
[1:35:03] Temple so that that's sense where people
[1:35:06] think that you have your individual
[1:35:11] Faith because that's how the church is
[1:35:13] being run everybody is an
[1:35:16] individual no the church is a body amen
[1:35:20] right amen amen it's a body
[1:35:25] and just like your body your body is
[1:35:30] governed your body has a governor it has
[1:35:34] an engine your body is govern your heart
[1:35:38] the the the the the the Vibes of your
[1:35:43] heart your heart have four Vibes it used
[1:35:46] two to pump out it use two to take
[1:35:49] in and that's the same way the church is
[1:35:53] not just individual work individual come
[1:35:56] and do individual things no we have a
[1:35:58] governor this Bible is the
[1:36:02] governor that's why we have four gospel
[1:36:05] just like your heart have four
[1:36:07] Vibes
[1:36:14] amen you find it right in homes right
[1:36:17] right in
[1:36:18] homes husband wife parents children
[1:36:21] everybody want to be live an individual
[1:36:23] life that home will soon
[1:36:26] die it will soon die that's
[1:36:29] right because everybody running for
[1:36:32] their own thing no connection
[1:36:47] right and the cell phone now has make it
[1:36:51] worse it have make it
[1:37:04] W I need to get down to what I want to
[1:37:07] talk
[1:37:09] about this morning I'm only trying to
[1:37:11] help you to understand what I'm saying
[1:37:13] and not even started saying what I'm
[1:37:18] saying now so you see then and and and
[1:37:22] that is and that is the think you know
[1:37:24] that that is the think where uh uh uh
[1:37:28] when you when you see people trying to P
[1:37:32] you know the the the science agenda they
[1:37:35] are trying to you know uh uh uh
[1:37:38] disbelieve God and and uh uh what what
[1:37:41] is the major thing of science what do
[1:37:44] science
[1:37:46] do everything that science have
[1:37:50] invented they will always tell you
[1:37:54] that they
[1:37:57] discover that's what science is all
[1:38:00] about it's about disc
[1:38:02] discovering praise the Lord and then if
[1:38:05] they are discovering it means that
[1:38:08] somebody cover
[1:38:13] it for them to discover
[1:38:17] it everything that science invent is a
[1:38:21] discovery they did not put it there it
[1:38:24] was there it existed and they came and
[1:38:27] find
[1:38:30] it this electricity was discovered
[1:38:34] right if it was discovered which mean
[1:38:37] somebody cover it somebody place it
[1:38:40] there for them to be able to discover
[1:38:48] it are we together
[1:38:54] now so when you get when we get into
[1:38:56] that
[1:38:57] place and
[1:39:03] uh and I mean that's the thing that is
[1:39:05] killing the word today oh my god let's
[1:39:08] let's just read something here maybe it
[1:39:10] will help me to to get on on the right
[1:39:13] track
[1:39:17] here is this the sound of the end s is
[1:39:19] this the sound of the end see people
[1:39:22] Miss George te you know Jesus one time
[1:39:26] after his
[1:39:29] resurrection was walking down the shore
[1:39:32] with his Apostle and John was leaning on
[1:39:36] his bosom he said what what will happen
[1:39:41] to this man Jesus said what what is it
[1:39:43] today if he T till I
[1:39:47] come and there went out a
[1:39:51] saying that John was going to live to
[1:39:55] see Jesus come and the scripture say how
[1:39:57] be it he never say it that way praise
[1:40:01] the Lord so this this is just this is
[1:40:04] just a picture of even the disciples
[1:40:08] walking with our lord
[1:40:10] Jesus praise the Lord
[1:40:14] amen knowing of what the angel said
[1:40:18] about his birth and and and uh uh the
[1:40:21] the angel visited his mother mother and
[1:40:23] the kind of a lifestyle that is saw this
[1:40:26] man uh you know the the life that he
[1:40:29] live and and uh St John chapter 4 when
[1:40:32] they got right there the Bible says they
[1:40:34] went about to find something to eat they
[1:40:36] came when they came back to meet Jesus
[1:40:39] he was right there to the well with that
[1:40:41] uh uh uh uh Samaritan
[1:40:45] woman the Bible says describe that they
[1:40:48] all stood
[1:40:51] back why because
[1:40:53] according to their religious tender they
[1:40:57] know that the their Pharisees Pastor
[1:41:00] will not be playing with a woman like
[1:41:02] that will not be even having a
[1:41:04] conversation with a woman like that so
[1:41:06] to them now they all watching what is he
[1:41:09] doing how how is he stepping so low
[1:41:12] don't he know that that woman is is is
[1:41:15] that kind of a
[1:41:20] woman you see if they would have just
[1:41:22] turned back and go back to the city they
[1:41:25] will carry Romans to the rest of the
[1:41:29] disciples but Wa A whyde and see what
[1:41:32] kind of a conversation that he's having
[1:41:34] with a

[1:41:38] go and call your husand and the woman
[1:41:40] said I don't have husband he said yeah
[1:41:41] you said the truth because even the one
[1:41:43] you are with is not your
[1:41:46] husband and right away they realize that
[1:41:50] you know this woman is saying oh my God
[1:41:51] I perceive that you are a Prophet when
[1:41:54] the Messiah cometh he says I am he so
[1:41:57] because they took time to
[1:42:02] wait they could have Mis judge what they
[1:42:05] are seeing with their
[1:42:07] eyes but because they took time to wait
[1:42:10] and they saw the
[1:42:13] result praise the Lord they saw the
[1:42:16] result this woman that had a hidden
[1:42:19] private life she was able to throw the
[1:42:21] water bucket down R into the street and
[1:42:23] say come and see the man that told me
[1:42:25] the things that I have
[1:42:31] done but people Miss George
[1:42:35] things people Miss George
[1:42:39] things we said the same thing of Sarah
[1:42:43] uh she was the one that told hega you
[1:42:45] know come uh uh uh be with my husband
[1:42:49] and now ishad is born and now she's Mis
[1:42:51] judging that this girl is morg her
[1:42:57] how ha God is put away and ha God also
[1:43:01] is misjudging H H Sarah to be a crural
[1:43:07] woman that's what misund understanding
[1:43:13] does praise the
[1:43:15] Lord that's what Mis understanding does
[1:43:26] are we
[1:43:31] together we were playing this tip this
[1:43:33] morning God being misunderstood it was
[1:43:36] right from the subject that I thought we
[1:43:37] should listen to that you know
[1:43:40] misunderstanding get us in a lot of
[1:43:42] trouble many times that people say
[1:43:45] things that they repeat after somebody
[1:43:50] else where they make misunderstood them
[1:43:54] that get a person in trouble I believe
[1:43:57] it would be good for us if we were just
[1:44:00] well wait till we understand what we are
[1:44:04] talking about praise the Lord
[1:44:09] amen you see because the way we are made
[1:44:13] the way we are made that's what I want
[1:44:16] to get to now if I if I can be able to
[1:44:19] to
[1:44:20] uh uh let's read this from mechis the
[1:44:24] great
[1:44:25] prince in the way that we are made like
[1:44:28] I said we are peculiar every one of
[1:44:31] us there's three
[1:44:34] element that a man
[1:44:37] follow in uh in uh uh subsequent
[1:44:40] messages he said there's three element
[1:44:42] that a p people door in you know so it
[1:44:46] it's it's something that makes our our
[1:44:48] the way we deal with things here on
[1:44:50] Earth you know it's in the realm of the
[1:44:53] these three
[1:44:54] element the first is uh the humanistic
[1:44:58] and that's where we all are we are
[1:45:02] humans that are governed by five
[1:45:05] senses to contact our body our our body
[1:45:09] our flesh and we have uh five senses
[1:45:14] that we use to contact our spirit
[1:45:16] imagination affection you know memory
[1:45:19] conscious and uh uh uh uh and then we
[1:45:24] have uh uh a sense of the
[1:45:27] Soul could be either Faith or doubt
[1:45:30] depending on where the person is in
[1:45:32] their relationship with God are we
[1:45:35] together now so as Hans we are in this
[1:45:40] realm as humans we try to understand
[1:45:42] things as
[1:45:45] humans praise the
[1:45:47] Lord and uh if we hear something we rely
[1:45:51] on our hearing to to uh you know to
[1:45:53] prove what it's right then there is a
[1:45:55] second realm which is a divine
[1:46:00] revelation and the third R is uh thou
[1:46:03] said the
[1:46:05] Lord and many times we are down
[1:46:10] year and we never claim into this which
[1:46:13] mean we are in this humanistic realm you
[1:46:16] you read in the Bible the Bible says
[1:46:20] that uh uh uh uh
[1:46:23] in the book of Hebrew that every every
[1:46:26] man that comes to God must believe that
[1:46:28] he exists and with our faith it is
[1:46:33] impossible to please God are we together
[1:46:37] so it it makes us to realize that faith
[1:46:41] is another realm above our himmer that's
[1:46:47] right
[1:46:50] okay because because de with God
[1:46:54] understanding God that's where the
[1:46:55] misunderstanding comes because just like
[1:46:59] what we just read from Exodus chapter 19
[1:47:02] if you read it literally you would say
[1:47:04] well but but this is what the Bible is
[1:47:08] saying but if you study the word as a
[1:47:11] progress in uh in uh H H exhalation and
[1:47:15] explanation you realize that oh
[1:47:18] wow it's deeper than what is been said
[1:47:24] because you see God is not at our level
[1:47:26] he's not a man that he should Li he's
[1:47:29] not a
[1:47:31] human praise the Lord he's
[1:47:35] Divine so for God to be Hood we have to
[1:47:39] step a little bit out of our human
[1:47:43] realm and come to the place of divine
[1:47:47] revelation that's what faith is Faith is
[1:47:51] a revelation
[1:47:55] are we
[1:47:56] together and that can only come by the
[1:47:59] new birth it can come by membership it
[1:48:02] can come by contribution it can only
[1:48:04] come by the new birth to be born
[1:48:10] again and that's the reason why we have
[1:48:12] all of the confusion because a person
[1:48:14] can pick up the Bible see see see see
[1:48:16] what what what the Bible says you know
[1:48:18] sometimes I see some of those things you
[1:48:20] know uh people post things there on
[1:48:22] YouTube see what the Bible say and it
[1:48:24] said and you are saying
[1:48:27] wow did he read the verse before that
[1:48:30] and the verse after
[1:48:32] that why because we are using our human
[1:48:37] mind our human way of understanding to
[1:48:40] be able to read God's word and satisfy
[1:48:44] ourself that we are reading what the
[1:48:47] Bible says or what God's word says
[1:48:55] are we together Paul says in Corinthian
[1:48:58] no man can understand the things of of
[1:49:00] man except the spirit of man is in him
[1:49:03] and that is the same thing with God no
[1:49:04] man can understand the things of God
[1:49:06] except the spirit of God is in him so
[1:49:09] you see how that misunderstanding comes
[1:49:13] that is with the
[1:49:15] Divine the misunderstanding with ourself
[1:49:19] is because we are peculiar
[1:49:25] we are
[1:49:27] peculiar the thing about life on Earth
[1:49:30] is
[1:49:31] there we are born we are placed here to
[1:49:36] discover ourself every stage of your
[1:49:39] life you're going to discover
[1:49:42] yourself that's what we are doing every
[1:49:45] stage of our
[1:49:50] life you get a job you you go to to a
[1:49:53] job and it train you and you you know
[1:49:55] you you train at a job and then uh from
[1:49:59] the beginning you get there you look at
[1:50:01] all of the equipment you say oh wow wow
[1:50:04] but then as soon as they start training
[1:50:07] you you realize that uh there there
[1:50:11] there's there's an attribute there's an
[1:50:13] ability in you that you did not know you
[1:50:19] had so what you now discover that you
[1:50:22] can do do
[1:50:25] that and the reason why we are
[1:50:27] discovering ourself is because we are
[1:50:32] peculiar have you have you ever heard
[1:50:34] parents say this I mean children say
[1:50:36] this parents also say it well I never
[1:50:39] knew this thing about this
[1:50:42] child or the child would say I never
[1:50:45] knew my daddy can do
[1:50:48] this praise the Lord amen and as long as
[1:50:53] we live there are a lot of things that
[1:50:56] you never knew that you will
[1:50:59] know because the people that you are
[1:51:01] dealing with they are
[1:51:03] peculiar they are there their abilities
[1:51:06] that are in them their potential that is
[1:51:08] in them is even hidden to
[1:51:12] them you ever hear somebody says I never
[1:51:14] knew you can do that I myself I never
[1:51:16] knew I could do
[1:51:19] it why because the ability was there and
[1:51:22] he never he just discovered that he
[1:51:25] could do it oh
[1:51:26] wow since when you've been playing drums
[1:51:29] or since when you've been doing
[1:51:33] this oh I never knew I could do that you
[1:51:36] know I just I just it just I I just try
[1:51:38] it and and I I found myself doing it
[1:51:41] it's being there all this
[1:51:43] while it's it's being
[1:51:50] there you can look at both negatively
[1:51:53] and both
[1:51:56] positively even some actions of uh of of
[1:51:59] people that you love that comes out and
[1:52:02] you you just oh wow I never knew that
[1:52:04] that person can talk like that or they
[1:52:06] can curse like that or it's oh
[1:52:10] wow that's something that was healing
[1:52:13] there praise the
[1:52:17] Lord that's the source that's the source
[1:52:20] of of all of our misunderstanding
[1:52:23] in the himay is because we are all
[1:52:27] peculiar
[1:52:29] amen we are all peculiar
[1:52:33] people our God is also
[1:52:36] peculiar praise the
[1:52:38] Lord
[1:52:39] hallelujah and he's he's he's he's he's
[1:52:42] bringing us to this
[1:52:50] place you know you will see that's the
[1:52:53] reason
[1:52:56] why God in every
[1:52:59] age he will set a standard for his
[1:53:04] people he had a Jeremiah he had a Isaiah
[1:53:07] he had a Danel down in Babylon he will
[1:53:11] always raise a
[1:53:16] man to be able to bring a word to his
[1:53:19] people in that given time to grab their
[1:53:23] attention because you see just like I
[1:53:25] said this is the
[1:53:28] earth and the and and and and the and
[1:53:30] the the the treasure Stones the the
[1:53:33] healing Stones The Peculiar stones are
[1:53:36] hidden in this earth and it's God that
[1:53:39] put it
[1:53:42] there praise the Lord
[1:53:47] amen at our birthday we don't go we
[1:53:50] don't go to the hospital and it take out
[1:53:53] uh you know uh uh uh our 10 years old
[1:53:55] legs and give us 15 years I mean 11
[1:53:58] years old you know and says now I'm I'm
[1:54:00] now I'm a teenager I don't need this U
[1:54:03] you know I I need a teenager I'm they
[1:54:05] don't do it why it's in
[1:54:08] you it comes up with your as you grow
[1:54:14] up God place it in
[1:54:21] you once you were a child and and you
[1:54:24] played around as a child as you grow up
[1:54:26] and and and thinking about home and
[1:54:28] thinking about family I mean uh uh uh uh
[1:54:32] everything for you to be a father or a
[1:54:35] mother God already plac it in that is
[1:54:37] the PE h h h peculiar thing of the way
[1:54:41] that God made us that is the mystery of
[1:54:44] our
[1:54:47] life that's why the prophet of God says
[1:54:49] our natural birth is more mysterious
[1:54:54] why because it's
[1:54:57] peculiar that God will take 23
[1:55:00] chromosomes from your mother 23
[1:55:03] chromosomes from your diet bring you to
[1:55:05] bring it together to to form a unique
[1:55:09] character of
[1:55:12] yourself he said when I laugh I remember
[1:55:15] my mom I laugh just like when I stretch
[1:55:17] my head I just what my dad can do
[1:55:26] praise the Lord
[1:55:30] amen you see and that's the reason why
[1:55:33] the Bible asks us to do these things
[1:55:36] pray for one another James said confess
[1:55:40] your fault to one another praise the
[1:55:43] Lord amen amen confess your fault to one
[1:55:46] another what does it means sit down
[1:55:50] identify your failures
[1:55:54] talk about your
[1:55:55] struggles the Bible say one another
[1:55:58] confess your fault to one
[1:56:01] another there is not it's not a priest
[1:56:04] and somebody coming to confess to them
[1:56:06] no you sit down and you talk about
[1:56:11] it why because in doing that it gave us
[1:56:16] the opportunity to understand one
[1:56:18] another
[1:56:22] now because these things are shared when
[1:56:25] this person is dealing with this
[1:56:27] struggle I can be able to bear with them
[1:56:30] because I have an
[1:56:32] idea I didn't not have a vision I didn't
[1:56:36] read it from the Bible the person just
[1:56:37] told
[1:56:40] me I'm I'm sorry I I don't know I just
[1:56:43] have a fast hand I see things I just put
[1:56:44] it in my
[1:56:49] pocket praise the Lorden
[1:57:01] you know while if you have heard the
[1:57:02] story about you know these three great
[1:57:05] preachers that were that were good
[1:57:07] friends they they always meet and you
[1:57:10] know encourage one another and and and
[1:57:12] and all of that and you
[1:57:16] know and they were they were trying you
[1:57:19] know encouraging themselves to apply
[1:57:21] this scripture
[1:57:24] another guy you know was friend he says
[1:57:27] I I don't know I really need your
[1:57:29] prayers I'm I'm dealing with the spirit
[1:57:30] of
[1:57:32] lust and I I don't want to go into
[1:57:34] adultery that but I made my mind that
[1:57:37] the devil is just blasting my mind with
[1:57:39] all sorts of unclean
[1:57:43] thing then the other guy gained courage
[1:57:46] you see that's that's the way it happens
[1:57:48] you know because you know someone has
[1:57:50] laid their weakness on the table but now
[1:57:52] so the other guys you know he says he
[1:57:54] say yeah I mean I I don't have that
[1:57:57] problem you know my problem is just
[1:58:01] fiz I'm not I'm not doing well and you
[1:58:05] know um uh yeah sometimes I just I just
[1:58:08] take the church
[1:58:10] money I need help in that
[1:58:15] area praise the
[1:58:20] Lord the third guy he says well my only
[1:58:24] problem is Gossip I can't keep my mouth
[1:58:28] shut whatever I hear I
[1:58:32] tells praise the Lord am I think he had
[1:58:36] the most problem because these guys now
[1:58:38] afraid he going to tell their things
[1:58:45] out praise the Lord amen
[1:58:53] like Solomon said you know the word the
[1:58:56] word will bring healing it brings
[1:58:58] healing to our body just like I said
[1:59:01] this morning if there was not a heaven
[1:59:02] to go
[1:59:04] to this word can give you a decent life
[1:59:08] it can help you to raise a decent
[1:59:12] family it can give you life
[1:59:18] value praise the Lord am
[1:59:22] yeah because that's that is the reason
[1:59:23] why I mean the word is in such a
[1:59:25] confusion because it just looks like uh
[1:59:28] h h h there is nobody to trust this
[1:59:32] person is breaking this person heart
[1:59:34] deceiving this other person lying to
[1:59:36] this other person but what what it
[1:59:38] Solomon says here trust in the Lord with
[1:59:40] all your heart and lean not to your own
[1:59:49] understanding it brings healing it help
[1:59:52] us to govern ourself it tells you that
[1:59:55] uh your your body your body is uh is uh
[1:59:58] is uh is uh is uh h a treasure
[2:00:04] house that God has put hidden treasure
[2:00:08] in E vessel that's what Paul said that's
[2:00:12] the thing that makes us
[2:00:16] peculiar with with all of our struggling
[2:00:19] and our weaknesses and everything there
[2:00:21] God God has designed Us in such a way
[2:00:24] that if we would just learn to trust him
[2:00:28] he's the one that made us he's the one
[2:00:30] that faction
[2:00:39] Us Praise the
[2:00:47] Lord we all want to be understood
[2:00:52] we don't take the time to understand the
[2:00:56] next
[2:00:57] person praise the Lord you see God said
[2:01:00] it in a way he said it in a way that uh
[2:01:04] none of us are born with our parents God
[2:01:07] did not throw us down from
[2:01:11] heaven we are all born with
[2:01:15] parents there's a union of a man and a
[2:01:17] woman that brought us here now God said
[2:01:20] it in a way that they that will be from
[2:01:23] that from that from that place from that
[2:01:26] stage will be where we will start having
[2:01:29] some identity of
[2:01:34] ourself because there will be there h h
[2:01:38] h h uh to to see how we cried and what
[2:01:41] we do uh in in a time where we are
[2:01:44] innocent and didn't have no knowledge of
[2:01:47] uh you know what we used to do what we
[2:01:50] used to eat how do we cross we don't
[2:01:52] have no idea but there were people that
[2:01:54] saw
[2:01:55] that that can tell you when you were
[2:01:58] little this is what you did you used to
[2:02:00] cry too much you don't want to believe
[2:02:02] it but they saw it amen you better
[2:02:03] believe
[2:02:04] them it will help you to start
[2:02:07] discovering
[2:02:11] yourself so God said it that way but you
[2:02:15] see in the way that he designed it there
[2:02:19] are things that you will know about
[2:02:21] yourself
[2:02:23] that there is no way you will know as
[2:02:26] long as you stay in that company so what
[2:02:29] will happen is that God also designed an
[2:02:33] institution where we go to learn whether
[2:02:36] it is school whether it is trade what
[2:02:39] whatever so we leave that home and we go
[2:02:43] out into another
[2:02:45] setting you realize that the teacher
[2:02:48] comes and tell tell the parent and says
[2:02:50] your boy is a smart board in the father
[2:02:53] now with what he have discovered of his
[2:02:55] son from the time the son had said no he
[2:02:58] said
[2:02:59] dummy why because he's
[2:03:03] limited he's only sticking with what he
[2:03:06] has discovered in that few period of
[2:03:09] time but the child is spending more time
[2:03:11] with this person this person is
[2:03:13] discovering some other things that the
[2:03:15] parent will not discover
[2:03:23] all this Gody is smart at me he's
[2:03:25] brilliant he's
[2:03:30] creative and then he comes to church he
[2:03:33] talks to the pastor as it talks Salone
[2:03:36] the pastor can see you he's a brilliant
[2:03:38] guy but under His Brilliant he's dealing
[2:03:41] with something there is something that
[2:03:43] is bothering
[2:03:46] him because the pastor can read his body
[2:03:49] language
[2:03:53] so the pastor now has discovered
[2:03:55] something that the teacher did not
[2:04:07] discover so I can I can talk to the
[2:04:09] teacher the teacher can tell me he's a
[2:04:11] smart girl man the board is very
[2:04:14] smart I mean on a Rheumatic mouth I mean
[2:04:18] he's just wow he's a Genus
[2:04:27] and in my mind as as a as a preacher I'm
[2:04:29] saying wow oh
[2:04:33] God can you just help him to Chanel that
[2:04:39] smartness to deal with his
[2:04:43] habits that smartness can you just
[2:04:46] Channel it in a way where he can be able
[2:04:49] to
[2:04:50] De because The Habit is creating complex
[2:04:54] for
[2:04:59] him praise the
[2:05:07] Lord then he go and find a
[2:05:14] girl now he know himself from from uh
[2:05:17] from from from uh uh uh uh child who
[2:05:21] what the parents said about him he knew
[2:05:23] what the teacher said he's a smart guy
[2:05:25] he's a brilliant guy I he get a in all
[2:05:27] of
[2:05:30] his then he remember also what the
[2:05:32] teacher said I mean what the preacher
[2:05:36] said now he goes into another state all
[2:05:39] of these are are stages of
[2:05:44] relationship in every stage of
[2:05:46] relationship we discover
[2:05:55] that's the reason why in I mean I mean
[2:05:57] in in the church it's not it's not is
[2:05:59] not governed in a way where that I mean
[2:06:02] we we we try to keep people by position
[2:06:05] no as a preacher as the Holy Spirit we
[2:06:07] we we sit right there we sit on we we
[2:06:10] try to watch for the gifts that are in
[2:06:12] the people how they can
[2:06:16] Ser praise the
[2:06:18] Lord so we don't want look at your
[2:06:21] attendance in church we look at how you
[2:06:22] live out out of church
[2:06:27] also because you might have one life out
[2:06:30] there and then when you come here I mean
[2:06:31] you are you are the guy on top of the
[2:06:33] roof praise the Lord you are the you are
[2:06:37] the God on top of the roof I mean you
[2:06:38] blowing the roof off I didn't know what
[2:06:40] you took this
[2:06:45] morning but there are there are there
[2:06:47] are all stages of relationship and in
[2:06:50] all of those stages of
[2:06:53] relationship there are things that we
[2:06:55] are discovering there are things that we
[2:06:58] are discovering of ourself that we never
[2:07:02] knew when a person comes to the place
[2:07:05] and say I know myself I can never do
[2:07:07] that there a language of
[2:07:14] deny it's a language of deny the person
[2:07:17] is building a defense
[2:07:21] and if you check close there is more
[2:07:23] than
[2:07:24] that I know myself I can never do
[2:07:29] that so if if if a person says that what
[2:07:33] is happening here is two things that is
[2:07:36] happening now you have to bring the
[2:07:39] conversation convince the person because
[2:07:41] they are either misunderstanding you or
[2:07:44] there is something about yourself that
[2:07:46] you you have not discovered
[2:07:49] yet so now I must I must convince you oh
[2:07:52] yeah you really saying there is it truth
[2:07:55] is that what I'm
[2:07:56] doing okay well I I don't know I think
[2:08:00] it was
[2:08:02] because
[2:08:04] uh yeah okay okay I remember now yeah I
[2:08:07] remember exactly what you are saying I
[2:08:09] think it was because uh uh yeah yeah you
[2:08:14] you are right you know I mean um I was I
[2:08:18] was I was not in a good mood and and but
[2:08:21] if you just I know myself I can never do
[2:08:25] that you're making that person more
[2:08:27] suspicious of
[2:08:31] you why because you're not helping them
[2:08:34] to understand you they are seeing
[2:08:36] something
[2:08:38] that that they are just
[2:08:41] discovered and what you doing is that
[2:08:43] they just took it off what you do is
[2:08:45] that you chunk it by and you close the
[2:08:47] F you just shut it off
[2:08:53] you're not going to be any better
[2:08:55] because what you're going to do now you
[2:08:58] just build defense in your mind I can
[2:09:00] never do that what what it think what
[2:09:02] what he think about me what you know you

[2:11:38] uh brother Brandon ministry right right
[2:11:40] on from the
[2:11:42] 70s see what he says here in uh uh
[2:11:47] Daniel's 7th week when he was talking
[2:11:49] about this seven seven Visions he says
[2:11:53] now I do not want anyone to go away
[2:11:58] misunderstanding
[2:12:00] this he said the tip is still playing I
[2:12:04] don't want anyone to misunderstand it
[2:12:06] don't misunderstand now and say brother
[2:12:09] brandham said Jesus will come in
[2:12:14] 1977 I never said no such a
[2:12:18] thing but if there is one one of the
[2:12:21] first scandle that people would bring
[2:12:23] about brother Brandon Ministry is that
[2:12:25] he said Jesus will come the world will
[2:12:27] end in
[2:12:29] 1977 and yet he's saying he's begging
[2:12:32] the people please don't go and misund
[2:12:35] and yet he still
[2:12:45] misunderstood praise the Lord amen
[2:12:49] sometimes we are making all the effort
[2:12:52] you are making every effort but you see
[2:12:55] misunderstanding sometimes will come
[2:12:57] from uh uh uh the state of a person's
[2:13:06] mind it would come from the state of a
[2:13:09] person the the person could have their
[2:13:11] mind in a setting
[2:13:14] State and then you say something for
[2:13:17] them to get out of that state of mind to
[2:13:20] be able to for
[2:13:21] understand what you are
[2:13:26] saying says why are you judging
[2:13:29] me is because they are in that state of
[2:13:32] mind they feel like theyve being
[2:13:44] judged that's how peculiar our entire
[2:13:47] being
[2:13:48] is you're trying to do your best trying
[2:13:51] to do your
[2:13:56] best you see because there is this place
[2:14:00] of our being our our spirit man you know
[2:14:03] where our our mind H that that inner man
[2:14:06] of ourself that we don't have control of
[2:14:10] I mean you can you can keep your hand in
[2:14:12] your pocket and says well I will just
[2:14:13] keep my hand I don't want him to say
[2:14:14] that I touch anything I would just keep

[2:14:20] when they show the Cera they will see
[2:14:21] that my hands is in my pocket you know
[2:14:23] and you can do that but when it comes to
[2:14:26] the real
[2:14:28] of your
[2:14:31] memory your spirit your your spirit
[2:14:36] real I mean sometimes it's it's hard to
[2:14:39] keep memories coming back to your mind
[2:14:42] you really don't have control over it
[2:14:44] you try to shake your head but you keep
[2:14:46] you don't want to remember but it keeps
[2:14:48] coming back
[2:14:57] praise the
[2:15:03] Lord Isaiah said in in Isaiah
[2:15:06] 26 verse three that's that's a familiar
[2:15:14] scripture that's a very familiar
[2:15:16] scripture the prophet Isaiah says he you
[2:15:19] know uh speaking
[2:15:21] and God says I will keep in peace he
[2:15:24] says uh
[2:15:27] uh
[2:15:29] 26:3 th we keep him in perfect peace
[2:15:34] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[2:15:37] trusted in them praise the
[2:15:40] Lord even though you don't have control
[2:15:43] over those memories and and and over
[2:15:45] things that happen in your in your
[2:15:48] spirit realm but you see there's a
[2:15:50] promise here here where God is saying I
[2:15:53] will keep you in perfect peace they will
[2:15:55] come they will not bother
[2:15:57] you why because your mind is stayed on
[2:16:00] me amen and you are trusting me to deal
[2:16:04] with the situation am I don't have
[2:16:06] control over it they will come but him
[2:16:10] that keep his mind on the Lord has a
[2:16:14] promise that he will be kept in perfect
[2:16:17] peace
[2:16:25] and sometimes that's that's the way
[2:16:27] that's the place where people
[2:16:29] fail says well you know I I I really
[2:16:32] can't get it off my mind so I I I don't
[2:16:34] think I can continue I I really I don't
[2:16:36] I don't think I can continue we can we
[2:16:38] can't be friends because I can't get it
[2:16:40] off my you will never be able to get it
[2:16:42] off your mind cut that person from your
[2:16:45] life change your address move out of
[2:16:47] state go out of out of the country you
[2:16:50] will never leave it from your
[2:16:54] mind you can't take it
[2:16:57] away you can put your head in your brain
[2:16:59] and take out crazy things
[2:17:02] away but there's a promise
[2:17:06] here I will keep him in peace amen whose
[2:17:09] mind is still on
[2:17:10] me why because he's trusting me
[2:17:18] amen so even though the memory will
[2:17:23] come but if I keep my mind on the
[2:17:27] Lord if I trust
[2:17:32] him I'm not going to fall into
[2:17:34] depression I'm not going to fall into
[2:17:37] anxieties and all of that because I'm
[2:17:39] keeping my mind if I don't those things
[2:17:42] are enough to throw me into those things
[2:17:46] to make me
[2:17:47] anxious and just make me angry
[2:18:00] are we together
[2:18:07] amen dealing with
[2:18:12] misunderstanding is something that we
[2:18:13] cannot avoid so let's deal with
[2:18:17] it you cannot avoid to be misunderstood
[2:18:21] you will be Mish honest to how do you
[2:18:23] deal with it when people misunderstand
[2:18:29] you you can avoid
[2:18:37] it go in the room like the door don't
[2:18:40] come out Ask Door Dash to bring your
[2:18:42] food everything we will say Miss
[2:18:45] understand you
[2:18:52] he's spending all that time in the room
[2:18:53] because that that that guy he's I
[2:18:58] mean maybe he's
[2:19:00] drunk that's why he's not coming
[2:19:03] out in every everybody will get no I
[2:19:06] don't I don't think he's drunk no no I
[2:19:09] don't think he's
[2:19:10] drunk yeah maybe I I don't
[2:19:17] know yeah it's not normal that's that's
[2:19:19] not that's not his attitud you the way
[2:19:21] he's behaving is not normal something is
[2:19:23] going wrong with that
[2:19:26] guy so you can you can avoid
[2:19:31] it praise the
[2:19:36] Lord but you see the scripture gives us
[2:19:39] a
[2:19:39] provision trust in the Lord with all
[2:19:43] your heart leay that to your own
[2:19:47] understanding in all your ways

[2:20:52] us there are these things that the
[2:20:54] scripture required of us that the
[2:20:56] scripture encourag us to do why because
[2:20:59] it builds a healthy

[2:21:09] church when we love one another we
[2:21:11] prefer one
[2:21:14] another and don't judge one

[2:21:33] one another uh to provoke to love and to
[2:21:37] good
[2:21:40] works that's that's what that's what the
[2:21:43] church is is is about that's what the
[2:21:45] body
[2:21:47] does this hand washed his hands
[2:21:53] the ear do the hearing for the entire
[2:21:59] body every part is is is set in a unique
[2:22:02] place and is is is supposed to be able
[2:22:05] to do uh H uh uh service the entire body
[2:22:09] the eyes do not see for itself if it see
[2:22:12] for itself it can't go anywhere because
[2:22:14] it needs the F to carry there
[2:22:20] but we get into that place and it's just
[2:22:23] us and ourself we're just so particular
[2:22:26] about ourself no Fellowship no no uh uh
[2:22:30] uh uh
[2:22:32] communion we must make effort to to
[2:22:35] edify to
[2:22:41] encourage find someone you are
[2:22:43] encouraging
[2:22:51] the Bible says uh I mean watch one
[2:22:53] another feet we had postpone communion
[2:22:55] here because of uh uh uh our changing
[2:22:58] weather and all of that but I mean you
[2:23:01] see those
[2:23:08] things you find people you you you just
[2:23:11] get so in your mind that you I mean
[2:23:16] uh you struggle to have the courage to
[2:23:19] ask you know a sister you know can can
[2:23:22] can can we wash
[2:23:27] feet you get your you get your feet
[2:23:30] washing partner and that feet washing
[2:23:32] partner until we go in the Rapture you
[2:23:33] and myself we have we are
[2:23:44] together that's not a healthy Church
[2:23:47] though we are all building our little
[2:23:50] clown
[2:23:52] our little
[2:23:54] tribe you know our little sweet
[2:23:58] group nobody else is in our
[2:24:03] cycle by doing that you setting yourself
[2:24:06] up fulfill
[2:24:09] you because the god of Heaven do not
[2:24:12] allow those things to exist it will be
[2:24:15] just for a while before you realize yes
[2:24:17] she used to be my good friend but now we
[2:24:19] can speak to one another what will
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:28] happen and you realize it's just it's
[2:24:31] just
[2:24:33] all one another it said more in the
[2:24:37] sense of one another but it is it is
[2:24:39] it's in a cross way it's I'm doing for
[2:24:41] you and you doing for me I'm praying for
[2:24:44] you and you praying for me
[2:24:53] do we find someone to pray to pray for
[2:24:55] do we have a Praying list where you know
[2:24:59] you put this person name there I'm going
[2:25:01] to intercede of this on on uh you know
[2:25:03] for this person and and and and that's
[2:25:05] and that's and that's the thing let me
[2:25:07] close this thing because the more I keep
[2:25:08] it open there is just so much here to
[2:25:14] share the reason why the church is not
[2:25:18] involved in those things is is
[2:25:21] because a prayerless church is a
[2:25:23] powerless
[2:25:29] church we get so selfish in our prayer
[2:25:32] life that's the reason why we are not
[2:25:34] exploring those
[2:25:37] things because you see when you get from
[2:25:40] that humanistic realm of praying and you
[2:25:43] and and and you are you are able to
[2:25:45] swore up a little bit you forget about
[2:25:48] yourself you forget about your needs you
[2:25:51] forget about h h h h uh uh uh your
[2:25:55] burden the things that are bothering you
[2:25:57] you get in the place where you I mean
[2:25:59] you get so burden for for
[2:26:09] people but we we are we are becoming
[2:26:15] prayerless We are Becoming prayerless
[2:26:18] this microwave a
[2:26:21] we are we are microwaving our prayer to
[2:26:24] God it's just a fast Quick Service no
[2:26:28] waiting on the
[2:26:29] Lord you don't find people
[2:26:37] groaning groaning word they don't have
[2:26:40] words to utter they're just crying and
[2:26:43] and they just go by is
[2:26:45] just the Mercy Mercy and and they're
[2:26:48] just groaning in their SP you don't find
[2:26:52] [Music]
[2:27:02] it and we are not becoming conscious of
[2:27:05] that we all trying to be some kind of a
[2:27:08] a super special
[2:27:11] Believers when was the last time you
[2:27:13] wrote a
[2:27:16] testimony when was the last time you
[2:27:18] wrote a prayer request for somebody you
[2:27:19] are bured
[2:27:22] [Music]
[2:27:29] about with all of these prayer meetings
[2:27:32] that we've been having if we were really
[2:27:35] bringing h h h h uh burden and needs for
[2:27:41] people we spend more time in praying
[2:27:43] than even the time we have to preach
[2:27:50] [Music]
[2:27:55] and we cannot say we don't have need we
[2:27:57] cannot say there are things that we
[2:27:59] don't see that are that are concerning
[2:28:01] to
[2:28:04] [Music]
[2:28:08] us but sometimes the devil just put us
[2:28:10] in this place either we are we are
[2:28:12] embarrassed because uh you know people
[2:28:15] will know that we need this thing to be
[2:28:17] pray prayed about you don't want to put
[2:28:19] your name don't put your name
[2:28:21] there if you even write unspoken prayer
[2:28:26] [Music]
[2:28:32] requests like I said
[2:28:35] before that's not the right thing to do
[2:28:38] we we come here and and come to make
[2:28:40] prayer prayer service and then we start
[2:28:42] facturing prayer requests in our
[2:28:45] mind no we must come we must bring it we
[2:28:48] must bring burden we we we read about
[2:28:51] that Revelation chapter 5 under the
[2:28:53] altar there was a bow that was filled
[2:28:55] with the prayers of the
[2:28:57] [Music]
[2:29:03] Saints we don't come and say and just
[2:29:06] start making a prayer re oh let's let's
[2:29:08] pray let's pray let's pray for this
[2:29:09] nation let's pray for the uh and and
[2:29:11] then we just start facturing things in
[2:29:13] our mind it must be burden from the
[2:29:15] hearts of the people
[2:29:19] [Music]
[2:29:22] and when that is gone there is no way
[2:29:24] you can edify one another who will you
[2:29:27] edify for you to edify somebody
[2:29:29] encourage somebody it must be a concern
[2:29:31] for that
[2:29:34] person for you to provoke somebody it
[2:29:37] must be a concern for that
[2:29:39] person how can I get to know them how
[2:29:41] can I encourage them in my first start
[2:29:44] from greeting them and saying God bless
[2:29:46] you how are you going to be burden for
[2:29:48] them you don't even know the their name
[2:29:50] you never shook their hands you never
[2:29:52] say hi to
[2:29:53] [Music]
[2:30:04] them do you see how the how how
[2:30:07] selfishness is settling down in our
[2:30:09] spirit me and
[2:30:12] myself and we soon get crown with a
[2:30:15] religious spirit
[2:30:20] and that relay your spirit only Fe on
[2:30:22] the
[2:30:23] past it only Fe on the past I used to

[2:37:57] me yes Lord Jesus yes Father
[2:38:05] lord it's something we deal with every
[2:38:07] day every day Lord father one thing come
[2:38:11] upon another Lord sometimes it's a
[2:38:13] statement that is made and oh God is not
[2:38:16] processed right to Lord is misunderstood
[2:38:19] how do we deal with it how do the year
[2:38:21] deal with
[2:38:27] it little Samuel when God called him God
[2:38:30] was calling from the realm of vision
[2:38:34] little Samuel was in h uh uh a
[2:38:37] humanistic realm when God called him he
[2:38:40] misunderstood he went to
[2:38:43] Eli and God called
[2:38:47] again he misunder tood and sometimes it
[2:38:51] it bother us to repeat it for the second
[2:38:54] [Music]
[2:38:56] time make the effort labor on it make
[2:39:00] the effort because if you don't make the
[2:39:02] effort it's going to affect
[2:39:05] you make the
[2:39:07] [Music]
[2:39:09] effort God make the effort and he calls
[2:39:12] Samuel again Samuel misunderstood he
[2:39:15] went to Eli God make the effort again
[2:39:18] and say sam
[2:39:23] [Music]
[2:39:25] here sometimes we don't get it the first
[2:39:28] time sometimes we don't get it we are
[2:39:31] not designed that way to just get it
[2:39:34] directly when the word of God speak to
[2:39:36] our
[2:39:38] heart sometimes God is calling us out of
[2:39:41] our Creed and out of our traditions and
[2:39:44] organization and and and and and and
[2:39:46] denominations to himself we don't get
[2:39:50] [Music]
[2:39:54] it but he don't give
[2:39:58] up sometimes he will use things that we
[2:40:00] will understand he he will create a
[2:40:03] situation around our lives he will put
[2:40:05] us in a situation and we come to the
[2:40:07] place and says well yeah no I I I think
[2:40:10] I think I need to give my heart to the
[2:40:11] Lord oh I I think I thinking it's it's
[2:40:14] that's the way he
[2:40:17] calls because we are not designed to
[2:40:20] understand his voice the first
[2:40:25] [Music]
[2:40:29] time he had to attract Moses by the
[2:40:32] burning bush and then when he got his
[2:40:34] attention then he call out but because
[2:40:37] he was born a prophet he could pick up
[2:40:39] the voice of God immediately
[2:40:42] [Music]
[2:40:55] we're living in a Time the society where
[2:40:58] is just so easy to be
[2:41:02] [Music]
