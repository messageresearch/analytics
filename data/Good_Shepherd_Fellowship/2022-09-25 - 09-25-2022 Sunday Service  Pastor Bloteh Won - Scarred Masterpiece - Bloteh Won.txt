into business this morning since we have to come back this evening uh Isaiah chapter 53 uh we would do a little exercise a responsive reading through the entire chapter let's let's stand on our feet and read together praise the Lord this is one of the sublime scripture in the Bible uh Isaiah 53 in our reverse one you reverse two and uh you can see the Lord will bless us to be able to get through it amen who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrow and the quantum with grief and we hate as it were our faces from him he was his spice and we asked him he met [Music] but he was wounded for our transgression it was rules for our iniquity the churchesmen of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed everyone and the Lord has created on him he was oppressed and he was afflicted here he opened at his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the sheriff is Dome so he opened at his mouth foreign he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he have done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth he shall see of the travel of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge my Russia 7 Justified meaning for he shall bear their iniquity [Music] foreign [Music] inequated by sorrow and by his try [Music] we will heal let's sing that one more time he was wounded for a while transgression [Music] he was brought [Music] in here [Music] his right free way Heavenly Father Lord we I wear your word together it is written in the scriptures that blessed at them that reads your word so God we will ask that the blessing will come upon each and every one of us this morning and father Lord is just not a Creed Lord or a form of worship for us but lord it's an identification when we stand to the reading of your word dear Lord so we want to just spread in Acts this morning as we bring ourselves just as we are we found no play asking that your grace will just come and help us this morning Father we ask a special Grace upon the service Lord and we just pray that you will bless us bless your children in the gifts this morning and even father those that are streaming the service Lord we ask that you bless them also the sake in our gifts Lord Heal them Father because we have just read your promised word father by your stripes we are healed oh God we ask this morning Father Lord and and uh What uh the the the inspiration on our hearts take it from our hearts make it react to the people father Lord God and we just asked that you will come out of the pages of your word and you'll move to every house this morning and uh break the bread of life to us Lord we thank you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord this was the scripture read uh I want to read I want to read uh praise the Lord yeah okay I think I feel praise the Lord let me see you I was reminded on Wednesday night let me let me let me take this first and then I will be able to situate myself here I was reminded on Wednesday night uh the the quote I read from perfect and I think we're the scriptures say he bowled our infremities I will remind you I said iniquities and uh but I mean every one of you people know me but now amen praise the Lord you just gotta you gotta you got to go ahead of me and praise the Lord as you'll be here in gibberish amen so uh one of the deacons reminded me of that and and I said I promised him I was going to get back to that it was a quote we read uh Sunday before I mean Wednesday night before the prayer meeting Jesus remember Jesus as we had in the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent for and you think sometimes why would a man that was so full of power like he will have to ever be saved yes sir I read in some books some words where when he raised up the boy the Widow son from then I believe it was the prince of the House of David there he sat on the Rock and he grown with a headache see he bowled our infremities bad means to pick them up and he had all things like we like we have he has sickness he had Temptation he had trouble he had frustration just as we have because he had to be the right kind of a mediator so he had to be partaker a hustler man of the fruit before he will know amen so uh and then this morning uh I will catch myself here very quickly because uh what I want to do speak on or I'm speaking on this morning is an inspiration that came from um the message God provided place of worship praise the Lord now this is uh 65 11 28 even though this is one of the messages that is part of the series that we're playing but it is not this particular one but listen to this one day down on Jordan after that Masterpiece have been formed a made year he comes standing down on the wings of a dove and said this is him he was so in tools with this masterpiece until he struck him on cavalry that he did die for the rest of us the rest of us was imperfect that through the sharing of his blood he might bring many masterpieces being a bride yes told his son masterpiece is scattered because the enthusiasm of God to see such a masterpiece now what what blame me to this is that I was I was looking through uh Skies I was looking through skies and and talking about the woman at the wedding and the woman calling adultery and all of these those women we've been talking about uh and Birdman was you know making mention that you have to know the story behind someone for you to understand their struggle and I started looking at scars and then I came across this the Masterpiece is God because the enthusiasm of God to see his Masterpiece so I want to speak this morning on discarded masterpiece discarded masterpiece praise the Lord this was actually supposed to be part of my nose I don't know why it didn't show up but uh we can we can take it from right here amen I want to I want to speak on the scattered Masterpiece I will have to trust the Lord this morning and uh that uh you know the the holy spirit will be our help amen and uh if you have listened to the Masterpiece series or message you will you realize that of uh brother Brennan went to see Michael Angelo Masterpiece that was built I think is somewhere in Florida or so he was there then and uh and his guy took him to see it and then uh when he saw it he was he was inspired to see that a man was able to materialize what he had in his mind the imagination The Invasion he had in his mind about Moses he was able to materialize that and in doing that uh uh yes Lord and in doing that that inspiration kind of forgot him he got he got struck he got attracted to death so he was driving one time and and uh talking with uh his daughter and her friend that was driving along with him and then he he got caught up in his mind and started thinking about that that was what Drew him to preach the message on the masterpiece there's a thought that is interrupting my mind I knew I wanted to say something and what I wanted to say is that the Lord has been so good to us amen that's just all I wanted to tell you that the Lord has been so good to us he kept interrupting my mind I don't know why yes it's making me too too stomach the Lord has been so good to us amen he has he has he has kept us he has blessed us and we want to be grateful to their amen this year has been has been filled with our plates has been filled with marriages I will be gone next week Sunday for another wedding and over in the DC and so I'll be here Wednesday night but then we leave uh just before Saturday to get there for the wedding and even Even in our group here the Lord has bless us we have brother aerial wedding we have sister Bridges wedding and both uh sister Naisha and sister Bridget are expecting babies so we want to further along thank you foreign [Applause] now I can preach praise the Lord amen yeah definitely that's a blessing amen that's a blessing unto us a child is born that's what the scripture says amen now so uh I have to recollect myself I would take myself from one of the natural inspiration to the spiritual inspiration but we will trust the Lord for that amen and uh so when you listen to the message Masterpiece I'm trusting the Lord to bring this and uh and and that she will kind of bless it to us because brother Branham said uh despite the work of Michelangelo was such a tremendous work uh highly praise for an extra ordinary Vision that he had about Moses but he believed that the masterpiece of Michelangelo work was the peace that that fed off when he struck the image and said speak yes he was so inspired he's so enthused that he had reproduced Moses that he wanted for that break to speak so when he struck it and says speak and so it put a scar in the in the in the Neo on the on the Neil's uh on the leg of the image so my brother Branham said yeah he says he believed that that was the masterpiece the peace that fell off praise the Lord amen he says uh it might be different from the way you might view it you might you might think that the entire work is the Masterpiece yes of course it's a masterpiece but uh for the fact that he was he was so inspired that he believed that their clay that he put together could speak back to him and uh and and you know and he had to strike it on the nail he says he believed that the Fallen peace was the masterpiece now so based on that he started to to build build the message I'm kind of for saying all of this so to to create an appetite in you for you to go and play now so he's saying this he he started going back to talk about how that was the same thing that God did when almighty God made his first Masterpiece in the Garden of Eden God wanted to make Man In His Image that's what he said I make man you know in my image and in my likeness and he was able to produce man that's right but just like we said man was made out of the Dust of the earth you know in his uh his toes were stuck in the earth as as a root and God breathed into his nostril for man to become a living soul and Adam was the son of God in the image of God and the likeness of God and but then it came a time where God struck Adam on the side and when he struck Adam on the side then he brought out a masterpiece now we're together amen amen hallelujah and uh [Music] so you see where word uh uh the prophet goes alone and build that they are taught for us to be able to see what he's trying to drive to all this truth that Adam was the image of God made in the image and the likeness of God but when God struck Adam he took off a little peace the rape of Adam and and and in there he pulled the mystery of redemption that we've been talking about amen now I'm saying all of this to be able to connect back to what we've been speaking about or through the the this this period of time so in in the woman now she becomes the Masterpiece even though it is true for Adam is a masterpiece because uh I mean anything he named God said it is okay amen he named the the animals and everything because he was a direct reflection of almighty God made in the image of God but yet God struck his son and then he brought out a flesh of his flesh and the bones of his born praise the Lord and in that woman he poured a representation or the mystery of his Redemption and uh and just like we've been saying he gave the woman three Divine qualities call it qualities there's a young sister that called me during the week one of my my uh many daughters and she said she said she says she said brother one I was following your service on Wednesday night and and then I was I was really blessed because I've struggled with the thought you know you read the Bible it looks and just like you said it looks like you know the the more character of man is spoken about than women is and it's just like you know everything that the women does is so quiet and silent and it's just Joseph is David he's uh you know all of that and then we go talking and uh and then I was talking to her about uh uh you know how the uh the power of the woman is in hervetous God designed it like that you know and just like I said on Wednesday night talking to her and I said you see that's the reason why you will never find a man to be a kindergarten teacher he can be a bus driver because he just get few minutes to stay with the kids praise the Lord I used to be one so I know exactly what I'm talking about but to be a kindergarten teacher you can never find a man he will just forget about teaching why because it's not in him he's not he can change his name to Ani or whatever he want to do he's not built that way he's not designed it's a god-giving vacuum you can learn it from a book yes Lord you can go to school and become a teacher but the virtue of taking care of children is God giving thank you Jesus thank you that was just a side piece the neuter praise the Lord so we were talking and you know I I said that to her just to kind of for to make the picture looks clear to her that you know those things are not picked along they are god-giving and God gave it for a reason you know God gave you for a reason and and it is it is uh it's uh is is it's alive from the devil you know just like we read uh invisible Union you know uh they they asked there are some uh that didn't have the grace to be able to keep one virtue and and yet they are blessed with the other ones you know I mean they turn out to be wonderful mother like uh Susanna Wesley that had all of those boys and and and uh you know and she was able to be a mother that stood out in history provided us uh uh uh a church-ish messenger and one of the one uh wonderful producers of hymns you know because it's god-giving you know so God uh because the mystery of redemption was was placed there in the womb and so he protected it with these three sacraments you you see there's the reason why the woman see has to come by a virgin he could not come back any other woman it has to come by the Virgin praise the Lord I mean there is just a whole lot of a thing that is tied to death because it all has to do with Redemption praise the Lord amen you see Paul talking there to the Corinthian Church came down to these gentile people and talking to them realizing that uh they were not giving the Lord you know uh I mean uh it actually takes the word of God to be able to protect to keep to to keep these virtues amen it will have to people that never grew up around the world they know they were not taught uh uh I mean uh they're they're so Paul came down to these people there in Corinthians and seeing all of the things that they have done and seen all the mixed marriages that was among them but yeah he taught them that if I believe in woman is married to an unbelieving man and is happy to stay he says well you have to know that your faith you know sanctify your husband what is that also Redemption it's Redemption praise the Lord he instructed treatment he says uh let the women keep silence for they must not soap authority over man is that place of taking the word but she shall be safe in childbearing what is that also Redemption that start back to the virtue because child bearing is motherhood now so we we see from the word of God you know that these these things they are not just an over makeup for brother Branham to to uh like people who think to make the message hard or to make uh uh know these things were the the you know the the mystery of God that will reveal to us and that's why we we count ourselves a privileged people so as he goes along to talk uh about this in in the in the in masterpiece he brings out a place where he tried to make us to see that uh uh we all came out from the birth through the fall and by that way we were mad but that way it created ascon praise the Lord we were all born with his car that's what brother Branham talks about and says there's a place where the devil have a right to he says that's the place you have to keep under the blood no matter where you were born how you were born Satan have a right to that place and he can hit you there no matter how smart you are what school you graduate from what degree you have the only thing that keeps him away is the blood the bleeding word you got to keep yourself under the word amen so we we are all born on the uh as a scar that spirit the most part of us that was affected when we were born is our spirit praise the Lord amen because I mean uh many of you were born very pretty very pretty babies with no scar on our body but our spirit was marked from the from from birth so I want you to to think about that being born in that way it was a masterpiece mm-hmm remember now we're talking about the scattered Masterpiece I want to grab you somewhere here and stay trying to contact your spirit that's what I'm doing everything I'm doing because uh uh we were all born with with a flawed and that flawed was being born in sin shapely in iniquity come to the word speaking lies that was his car that we that we uh that we had and and all all our our genetics you know our uh down from our parents and you know all flow down through that you know it all flowed down through that praise the Lord oh I see sister Comfort back there yeah William and his wife good to have you in church amen now so uh uh with that then we can now travel a little bit let's read from uh uh Revelation chapter four this this is a quote from Revelation chapter 4 Series not not uh uh your chapter Bible chapter about message series relation chapter four let's let's just read a quote to you and uh uh and then we can we can be able to travel together praise the Lord I'm very sure that I have that back there so uh the brothers came post it out for us Birdman says here in Revelation chapter four uh yeah he says he said today the body which of course is Jesus body okay yeah thank you thank you for the day and I forget and uh a testimony Year my brother's wife uh Freda is praising the Lord for her healing from cancer amen amen [Applause] everything he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen today the body sits there as a memorial as a sacrifice we get to dead right down through the chapter year but the spirit of Christ comes back to live in the church to live in US so what is he saying our lord Jesus body is sitting as a memorial in heaven praise the Lord that's why he ascended when Jesus Resurrected he never Resurrected in a brand new body he told Thomas come and put your hands in my palm amen he resurrected and uh uh historians and some scallops says the other that might have been some of the reason why he was not recognized because of the way he was treated you have to know that the Bible said the gushed out his beard they didn't shave it they pulled it out they beat him on his face you think about it why why wouldn't they recognize this man that he spent almost three and a half years with they didn't know who he was read Isaiah chapter 50. you see some of the description that the prophet as I have said that our lord Jesus who have been who have gone through praise the Lord Jesus never never resurrected in in uh in a new body that will create the fact why the disciples did not recognize him no praise the Lord amen now but you you will you will see the other when Jesus Resurrected he told Mary touch me that I'm not a senate up to my father okay when he says uh he says he says Merit she turned around and recognized that it was our Lord she was running to he said touch me now but go and tell my brother my brothers amen so ah we know in that in that in their space of time Jesus we saw that he manifested both the the the terrestrial the the celestra and uh and the glorified body right in that period of time because he was in a Celestial body that's why he could not be touched but after he had presented the sacrifice before God and it was accepted he took on a glorified body and at this time he could be touched but he could also go through the wall [Music] praise the Lord amen now so that body is a memorial to God praise the Lord amen the body of the Lord now is the church it's not that Sky bowling no is the church that's why he said to Paul why persecute thou me praise the Lord amen amen we think about the body of the law we we try to imagine him we try to keep this picture in our mind no this is the body of Christ yeah thank you Lord this is the body of Christ that's the reason why you I mean uh you I mean you you have to you have to know what you said about the church this is his body this is the body that he speaks up and says uh you know I will wish that a millstone was hanging around his neck and drown in the sea then to bring one accusation right yes that's right thank you Jesus thank you Lord praise the Lord but there is a body and someday we gather heaven we will see it it will always be that way and I believe that God keeps that body as a memorial for a reason because it's a masterpiece praise the Lord oh my it's a masterpiece I really need the help of God this morning to be able to preach and bring out and bring out what is on my heart is a masterpiece that body represent every hurt every abuse every insult because there was no human body that was maltreated like the way that body was treated and that's the reason why God keeps it in his own Galaxy as a memorial whenever he looks upon it he thinks about his Plan of Redemption glory be to God amen praise the Lord now so we we see here that the right from the beginning God had this plan of redemption we talked about it a prophet taught us he sees less stand on the bound instead of time and look before the foundation of the word and see that God in his mind great Allied Elohim a self-existing God with all of his abilities audio of his attributes wanted to make himself known praise the Lord he had this great great Plan of Redemption to be able to display his attributes make himself known praise the Lord and here he made his son in in uh placed him he says brother Brown says no man make you know uh build a beautiful artwork like Michelangelo Dawson and and put it in his room he had to pull it into a guiding you know uh the the guardian of Eden was set up because God had his Monument God had a living Monument yes it was all because of Adam and Eve the Perfection of the garden was the expression of the image that was in the garden like you go to any park beautiful place flowers out it's not about it it's about a structure that is placed there and God pulled his own structure there the reflection of himself a Psalm that is made in His image but this one it was a living Monument praise the Lord Hallelujah and uh and as time went on and everything that's that that we know happened there Adam was a perfect representation of God he speaks and and nature listened to him glory be to God bam says something also in that message Masterpiece he said all the prophets High flaws amen I hope uh I hope you message Believers are listening to me because this is what your Prophet said all the prophets have flaws and I don't believe that brother Brenham excluded himself praise the Lord now you will realize this morning if God can just help us because he's the preacher you will realize this morning is uh his train is made perfect in our weakness that God brought us through the family that he designed for us to come through he allowed us to go through the things that we experience in our life because to God is a masterpiece so God is a is the best person will he wants you to be for him to be able to express himself you will never appreciate his Plan of Redemption for your life if you were not the Way You Are praise the Lord unless we start thanking God that he have brought us through the things that we went through unless we start thanking God instead of looking at it in a very negative and ugly way and dwelling with regret in our spirit and unless we start being grateful to God that he reached down his hands and pull us out of the situation you will never appreciate God's redempted plan for your life because to God it was a master design Birmingham says all the prophets have flaws he says all the ones was a portioned have his time he says the first thing he did he tried Noah he's still speaking on the thought of Masterpiece he said he tried Noah and Noah fail he got drunk Moses that grandmother Masterpiece of God he tried him and he fell he glorified himself and wasn't permitted to go into the promised land then comes David he was a man after God's Own Heart and David was doing good he smiled all the Philistines and told them uh the altars and and still with the word and then finally a pretty woman upset him and he broke the Commandment of God lost the word committed adultery that's right praise the Lord amen and as always I like to do I was thinking about all of that and uh I knew I came across something before so I decided to go and look for it someone wrote a a pretty quote and he says before you say you are not qualified I recently came across this and I wanted to share with you Noah got drunk Abraham was too old as it was a Daydreamer Jacob line Joseph was abused Moses was a murderer and couldn't talk Gideon was afraid Samson had a long head he was afraid he failed to a woman Delilah Rahab was a prostitute Jeremiah and Timothy they were too young and Jeremiah was a crybaby David was a murderer and idolatery Elijah will switch sided somewhere but bam said he was depressed oh my goodness as I appreached without clothes he was a naked preacher Jordan I was a man I run away from the Lord Not only was the Widow job went bankrupt now you can go on and on and on I just wanted to relax you a little bit so all of God's prophets had a heart of yes amen Birdman said someone came to him and told him and said brother Brandon I don't know how he says I don't know why you I mean you can you the people regard you as a prophet and you just every time you preach you just get on those people so hard you know instead of fishing them spiritual gifts you just you just get on them and you know you get on the women and you know and all of that then uh he said he said he talks about one great composer and he says uh I believe that many of the perm that he wrote there were many many nights he will stay in his steady and he will write as the inspiration is coming to him he write them down then when the inspiration gets better you know you stretch it out throwing into the Dustbin and then he writes another one again when the inspiration gets better he's trashed it out and then and and he throws in the dust and then he gets to his pen again and right he says you will realize that if you look in the waste basket you will see pieces of inspiration the beautiful perm that you are reading now that you enjoy came from pieces of inspiration on all those people praise the Lord you look at it it looks like a waste but the beauty you see now came from those masterpiece praise the Lord amen you see an artwork and you appreciate it it is it's the final work that you are seeing but it came from many lines of strange papers and and and and and and with basketball because the inspiration was unfolding little by little it was unfolding and that was the same way with all the prophets a little of Christ was in every one of them unfolding until the fullness came in the mind Christ Jesus David heard of a letter of him Joseph had a letter of him Jacob had a letter of him Abraham had a little of him fullness of God ly praise the Lord amen but you see we will not have appreciate their fullness in a way that we understand it until we go back to the Old Testament and see in types and Shadow the things that he did in the lives of the prophets are we together praise the Lord so we realize here that it was God's design brother Branham said he says it will be it will be uh uh uh uh it would not be uh the right thing to God nature amen for God to make man and then just uh uh put in the path to sin he says so what God had to do he give man a free moral agency but almighty God had a plane he had a design and he had a blueprint in his mind and his desire was to make his Plan of Redemption manifest displayed his attributes show himself as a Healer as a savior glory be to God now you see he's uh uh talking about this and and and all through the week he had just laboring under this thought and and and then what what was what I was actually laboring on there is the thought of how you know uh sometimes people we become so shameful of things that we go through and then sometimes because of that it's almost like uh uh we try to uh behave as if it did not exist amen and sometimes uh uh uh I mean it's it's almost like you you will see it in a place where uh I've you know I've talked to someone uh uh some time ago that was there was one young lady that used to come to church here she'll come once in a while and and she wanted to see me and uh uh so uh I made an appointment to to meet her yet at the church and and in the back part of my mind I was thinking okay you know when a young woman like this trying to see you maybe she's trying to tell you that I want to get married you know I'm just thinking about that in my mind I said well maybe she's planning a wedding and she want to say well I want to bring I want to bring uh you know my my boyfriend or something like that you know she used to come once in a while so we met in and uh as we're talking somewhere right there in the foyer and and I could just see the struggle I mean she was she was just struggling and actually what it was it was an abused situation that she went through as a little child and she tried to she tried to keep it back keep it from her mind you know and and and and and just to see the struggle that she had so uh uh I think she was talking to a friend and and the person says well I think you need to go and talk to your pastor about it well because she considered me as a as a pastor for at that time she decided to come in and talk to me about it and and the thing also about it that is that the uh uh you know uh it was it was a kind of a family issue but also the the the the family member has has been dead and gone but you just see the the the Scott and and the and the hurt and and and uh so in my mind I'm sitting there and as I'm talking to her I'm I'm saying to myself uh oh my God I'm trying to find a place to be able to to to help this lady and we talk about it in in a while and as you talk about it she broke down she started crying and and and and all of that and and just just talking about how this now one of the things there is there the uh uh I mean she never did anything wrong sure she was the victim in this situation praise the Lord but you see that the thing there is the other uh uh protecting protecting that that that uh that that evil or protecting you know what have happened and then and keeping it as something as as a treasure you know uh that she don't want to think about it and and she don't want to talk about it and she don't want to let anybody know about it has been a scary room for her has been an area in her life because what those things will do is that it destroyed Trust right amen that's what abuse would do abuse would destroy Trust When people's experience abuses it destroyed trust and then what will happen also there is that the the spirit of the person gets so scarred by this thing that and whenever they get into an environment that ever create the same picture they become so terrifying praise the Lord are we together now so I'm I'm on this starting now you know I'm kind of for uh thinking about it and and uh you know and and as we as we were just going through all of the different uh women that we dealed with uh in the past weeks uh and thinking about their story then thinking about the struggle that they have we talk about the woman at the word uh last Sunday but just to see the the the Liberty the Deliverance you know when she met the Lord Jesus and Jesus went down to horse cars he went down told the abuse and the disappointment that she had in her life praise the Lord amen he went down there and and and and and identified and said look this this is where your problem is amen you you are a pretty girl you are a nice lady you are I mean uh uh that's that's that's that's a representation I mean she you you can just see that down in her soul was truth amen she was trying to be she was trying to be truthful there is nothing between the the Gentiles and I mean the Jews and the Samaritan when Jesus said I have it in water I would give you she said are you better than our father Jacob she was trying to you can see truth represented in her soul deep down in her soul there was truth but all of these things that have happened to her and in her life have have just so scattered her it has clouded that truth praise the Lord and over and over and over and over and over and over brother Brandon will say is that Jesus was contacting her spirit and he identified the same thing under the son of man Ministry he says I'm just contacting your spirit and that is the thing that we have to realize people this message has come to bring healing to our spirit it has come to heal us from the scars that has been created by churches and and family and some of the scars that run down our bloodstream that we didn't even knew about but because almighty God knows that you are a predestinated son of God or a predestinated daughter of God he sent a word to be able to Quicken that predestinated sea and if you can see Christ not seeing a pastor not saying that but if you can see Christ just like the woman otherwise saw Christ she saw the Messiah for her day their Messiah is the anointed word of the hour praise the Lord because you have to realize Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men I will pull oh man amen I would draw all men unto me once again the bride is going to be core equal praise the Lord because when God made them in the beginning they were called equal that's right that's right sin create domination I say create denomination praise the Lord a sin that creates domination but when he placed them in in Eden as his Masterpiece they were called equal that's why Parkin says that we will be joined here with Christ Lord amen so you see that word has come to lift us up praise the Lord that's why the prophet will come and says you never did it in the first place well he's going back to your original identification not trying to justify your flesh but he wants you to see yourself as almighty God sees you means yes amen are we together so all the prophets All Through the Ages High flaws even Joseph that came so close to be a perfect type of Christ he told a lie it was a design because if he never told a lie he would not be a type he will be Christ so the thing with times is that times breaks amen that's the reason why Barb said you have to wash your picture you cannot put a house over a a car over a house eating grass when people when sometimes people want to come out with all of these terrible types in the Bible you can do that because there are places where types breaks and there are places where the holes they connect there's a place there's a place in the life of a man take for Solomon Solomon in his life he had the mystery to represent Christ with a many member bride he how wives from every part of the word that was what he represents that's where the type holds but his wife led him away from God that's not a type of Christ so you see in in a sense of time it does it will not be every aspect of the person life there is no way you can make Solomon wise turning him to worship Idol you cannot bring Christ out of that are we together now so all of these things that we go through and many times we have been safe been born again we love the Lord even we have the Holy Ghost God has blessed us the joy of the Lord is our strength praise the Lord but sometimes what I realized that have happened to many people they are scarce in our lives that we have really not addressed with the word we have not been able to look at that in the light of the word it's just just like an evil treasure box we don't want to touch it we don't want to do nothing with hate but as long as you have that as long as you have that you might not be thinking about it you might not be Desiring it there will just be something either a flash of a color or a word that would be said praise the Lord it's just going to bust The Box open to your mind and your whole spirit is now in trouble praise the Lord and pretty soon everybody around you is affected they don't know what is going on but that evil attitude or thy evil energy let me call it an evil energy it's not affecting everybody you are now reacting because of something that have passed praise the Lord do you see why God is keeping a scattered body as a memorial you see why he's keeping a scattered body because he has already paid the price he has given the ransom praise the Lord he has given the Ramson today with I was standing last night I mean yeah yesterday Jesus died to take away our skies as well that's why we are giving white rocks the Bible says the white Rob represents the righteousness of the sins praise the Lord but you know also what it represents it represents our own scattered body praise the Lord amen when we come up in the resurrection I believe we are not going to come up with any sky on our body there will be only one scared of Body In Heaven it would be his body because whatever was the scar that had ever taken place whether it was physical or it was emotional spiritual whatever it is it was all represented in that body the Bible said hey please God that he will suffer yes yes praise the Lord some people make their scars their weakness they blame everything to their scar right they don't they don't they don't have no strength to try again they don't have no strength there is no strength there is no effort to do anything because this thing happened to me praise the Lord you have not had a revelation of God's Redemption you are just trying to make yourself a pitiful creature praise the Lord you are just trying to make yourself a pitiful creature you want to be just a creature of pity just to bring everybody to feel sorry for you all this thing happens to me we are not serving a dead Christ we are serving a one that was dead and resurrected and he's alive today so you don't have no reason yes to stay the Way You Are praise the Lord because there is no sin that he cannot forgive there is no sin there is no possession that he can deliver you from [Music] oh praise the Lord Hallelujah [Music] as much as these physical things are horrible to think about you think about it think about that woman of the world think about the letter caught in adultery lifting her eyes to Jesus and he said warmer where are thy accuser you should look around they are all gone Lord he said neither do I condemn thee go praise the Lord and a woman of the word Jesus saying to her you have six husbands and even a one that you just slept with last night it's not your husband you don't even trust him praise the Lord and just by going to that secret place of her life glory to that most sensitive sensitive place of her life Jesus going there brought such a healing and Liberty to that woman that you draw me into the street come and see him see them that have told me all that I have done people being curious It's not today that people started being curious man has always been there what have he told you that's right she said come and see the man I've told me all the things that I've done can you tell me what have he told you praise the Lord and I believe because God has visited her wounded spirit like Solomon said and won the spirit who can heal what I'm telling you there's a man here this morning the Lord Jesus Christ a man that have died and he can heal wound the spirit he healed the wounded Spirit of that woman she was not ashamed [Music] praise the Lord amen amen do you know sometimes a Holy Ghost Field believer holy something from the past can bring sickness on their body yeah do you know that you were not the aggressor you were the victim but just because you will not take it to Calvary just because you will not take it to Calvary you will offer the wrong room some kind of for sorrow some kind of a siren and take your mind back to all of the evil and every time you do that you are inviting demons for your life [Music] that's why Jesus said when you stand praying forgive and the prophet of God said that's the foundation of faith yes Lord yes praise the Lord Hallelujah that's why I fell on my heart and I thought that okay we we can approach the communities tonight just just having a prayer meeting pouring our hearts before God and seeking his Mercy in them just saying Lord you know I don't want no dark chamber in my life you know I I mean go through all the doors of my life I don't I don't want I don't want anything of the past I want to be able to trust it to the blood of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah praise the Lord that body says us a memorial the Throne of God it sits as a memorial you think about it he raised they deal back to life he healed the sake he overcame death what took the scars from his body [Music] yep praise the Lord he bowled all of those cars to represent everything that we go through the Bible say he was rejected even from the womb the priest will have nothing to do with him because he was called an illegitimate child he was rejected and despised that is something that must never be done to any child praise the Lord with all the evil things that was said that child was in the war he represent ing all the things that were said when you were either one all the things that we're playing all the things that were taught off glory be to God Amen and growing up as a young man as a teenager nobody want their children to to be identified with him because they all said he was a bastard child but he brought that to represent whatever sense of rejection that we went through when we were children what a living with our parents what are living with strangers whatever he bowled there right right from the womb to the Grave no s praise the Lord many of the Saints did not had a grave to be buried in Jesus never even had one he had to borrow the grave praise the Lord I had I heard somebody said he says uh when when Joseph went to ask for the body of Jesus it says uh uh you know at this time you ask him where are you going to bury him he says I'll put him in my tomb is wow such an expensive place in Joseph mine he knew that Jesus said in three days he said don't worry just a weekend just for the weekend I'm learning it just for the weekend praise the Lord [Music] it was just for the weekend man well you see what I'm saying this morning people amen we can never walk in this labor time where Christ has given us most of the things are where we think the attack you know our uh uh you know we've been careful yeah it's true we are living in such a world you have to be careful praise the Lord you have to stay with the word you have to be prayerful it helped you the most but you see many times it comes it comes back from a dark past that we struggle with praise the Lord now I'm not just saying you know just just Overlook those things and put yourself in the same vulnerable situation no that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that instead of being afraid of faith you have to face it and you have to take it to the one that can resolve it because what you want you want healing you want healing in your spirit because if not because of that fear you might either do the same thing or do worse to the people around you praise the Lord most of the time when we react and and sometimes when you cannot associate the reaction of somebody with a situation is because they are reacting from the past you just look I think you you just show yourself what did I just say that just snap the person off praise the Lord sometimes they are not reacting from what happened they are reacting something sink in their mind and they become defensive praise the Lord but you see that's the beautiful thing that's the beautiful thing that is the beauty of the god that we serve for the fact that that's what he picks up amen he called it a masterpiece he picks that up because I've always thought about the thought of a man of sorrow praise the Lord that God is not a god of evil yet in outside he says I create evil then I create good but he's not a god of evil and I've always used to think in my mind but then why did God create a sorrow why would Solomon says that it's better to go to the house of morning than to go to the house of feasting you know because there is something that is designed that is placed in our human Spirit people that every time you you just you will just realize it I mean if you if you ever get down I mean spend some time with the Lord and and and you just you are just you are just being grateful you are just being thankful to the Lord and pretty soon you start to appreciate him for your life you just break into China and then pretty soon you just start crying you are not crying because you you feel like a horrible sinner but you you have moved into a Channel of Sorrow sorrow is a China that God has built where he can weave around everything in our life to give to get a connection or get our uh connect with us to be able to grab our attention praise the Lord and he will Design This knowing that we are his sons and his daughters predestinated children of God for yet almighty God will sit there and allow our parents to make terrible mistakes we come through that or allow us to make mistakes in all of that and he sits there just to be able to reach out to us somewhere down the line praise the Lord you just think about the Apostle Paul a young Jewish Board of the Trap of Benjamin love the Lord and Lord the word of God he came from a very good home his his there was a Jew that took on a Roman citizenship went to one of the best schools well Paul realized that his zeal all the the the uh enthusiasm that he have for the Jewish law the only thing that could produce was the death of Stephen praise the Lord Paul realizing that the only thing that the laws who produced for him was the death of Stephen and with that with that he put himself to the place but Brandon said he says I took a life of this gospel I would give mine for it praise the Lord now why why would God couldn't deal with him in a dream like the way he dealt with Joseph in a dream praise the Lord but you look at poor life you look at the intelligence that he had a dream who have not been enough to convince him amen he knows how you are built amen he knows where all the the your genetics all the connection of your blood cells and all of the things that is running down he knows he knows that little strain of stubbornness that is right down there sometimes you will have to allow these things because you have to remember a chain is only strong at its weaker link praise the Lord you love the Lord this morning praise the Lord for he has a memorial God has been able to achieve to have a memorial some of his children were fair to the Lions some were sore asunder some were burned to the stake and with everything that went through he took the innocent life birth and death of Jesus Christ to represent every every pain every suffering everything everything that God do you know what it is taking those weight on his bad body those Roman soldiers smacking him in the face using Whatever Gets in his hand in their hands his face was so disfigured they pull out every strain of beer from his face they never rush him to the to the to the to the hospital to kind of Scar his body so it has to it has to be that way to get healed that was that was the only thing that that death did for him very quickly the resurrection that was the only thing that he did for Jesus quickly he healed the wounds and the Scar left it because when he showed his hands to uh uh uh Thomas it was not bleeding but he had wounds praise the Lord he was not walking around with a blasting body but he was walking around with a body that has cast all over it to represent whatever scar that we go through praise the Lord that we can look to Calvary and use whatever the devil wants to make a stunning block and use that as a stepping stone and get closer to God praise the Lord so we have to remember that that was God's purpose he has a memorial the body sits there as a memorial a sacrifice and his Spirit comes back upon the church praise the Lord so the Holy Ghost is here to remind us that's a body Before the Throne of God that we can relate all our sorrows our pains our discipline to musicians you can come forth the Lord bless you I was looking at the I don't know if I they send the worst day but I was looking at the chorus of that song the only scars in heaven praise the Lord foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus many times Lord father you you would deal with the heart of a Preacher in such a way Lord and and God it gets to the place Lord father we struggle to be able to bring your thoughts to your people but father Lord God it was a tough law to be able to help the Saints helped the church law to be able to appreciate your sacrifice Lord and father to realize who God that the blood that was shared the life that was given was a provision to deal with everything in our life not only things that we have done in world we are guilty of but if he thinks that haunts our life that we are victim of we never choose the family that we were born in we never choose the parents that we were born to [Music] but yeah Lord some of your children has gone through very hard shapes of life very high shapes of Life Lord and some will tell their stories where there were times they even wanted to they even question why are they existing why are they alive but right down in the Heart Lord there was a predestinated soul there was a predestinated seed Lord God you kept them through the tough time you kept them through the difficult situation you kept them through the close to death movement [Music] so they can be able to see your words see your light oh God and father how can we come to this place come to this place
