[4:32] though they did not worship according to
[4:34] truth
[4:35] word
[4:36] like judas they didn't go all the way
[4:39] see how judas was chosen of god he was
[4:42] instructed in truth
[4:44] he shared knowledge of the mysteries
[4:46] he had a ministry of power granted unto
[4:49] him and he healed the sick and cast out
[4:51] devils in jesus name
[4:53] but when the showdown came
[4:55] he sold out for gold and political power
[4:58] he did not go up to pentecost to receive
[5:00] the spirit of god
[5:01] he was devoid of the spirit
[5:04] make no mistake about it a person that
[5:06] is truly baptized by the holy ghost into
[5:09] the body of christ
[5:10] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[5:12] will be in the word all the way
[5:15] that is the evidence of being baptized
[5:16] with the holy ghost
[5:18] judas failed
[5:20] multitudes fail right there
[5:22] and when they fail to go on in that word
[5:24] their names are taken off the book of
[5:26] life
[5:28] in order to further clarify this removal
[5:30] of a name from the book of life we ought
[5:32] to extend our thoughts to israel in the
[5:34] days of moses
[5:35] exodus 32 30-34
[5:39] and it came to pass on the morrow that
[5:41] moses said unto the people
[5:43] ye have sinned a great sin
[5:45] and now i will go up unto the lord per
[5:48] adventure i shall make an atonement for
[5:50] your sins
[5:51] and moses returned unto the lord and
[5:53] said
[5:54] oh this people have sinned a great sin
[5:57] and have made them gods of gold
[5:59] yet now if thou wilt forgive their sins
[6:02] and if not plot me i pray thee out of
[6:05] thy book which thou hast written
[6:07] and the lord said unto moses whosoever
[6:10] hath sinned against me him will i blot
[6:13] out of my book
[6:14] therefore now go lead the people unto
[6:17] the place of which i have spoken unto
[6:18] thee behold mine angel shall go before
[6:21] thee
[6:22] nevertheless in the day when i visit i
[6:24] will visit their sin upon them
[6:27] it is more than evident that names have
[6:29] been and will be removed from the book
[6:31] of life their time shall be no more
[6:34] in this particular place it was because
[6:37] of idolatry even as when dan and ephraim
[6:40] lost their rights as tribes for
[6:41] worshiping the golden calves
[6:44] all who worship the idols had their
[6:45] names removed from the book of life
[6:48] when israel rejected the leadership of
[6:50] god in the pillar of fire and turned to
[6:52] worship the golden calves their names
[6:54] were removed from the book of life
[6:57] exodus 32 33
[6:59] whosoever has sinned against me him will
[7:02] i blot out of my book
[7:04] if such turning to idols demands the
[7:06] penalty of the removal of names from the
[7:08] book of life then most assuredly
[7:10] israel's rejection of jesus christ as
[7:12] messiah would demand as severe a penalty
[7:15] this is exactly so
[7:17] in psalms 69 which sets forth the
[7:20] humiliation of jesus it says in verses
[7:23] 21 through 28
[7:25] they gave me also gall for my meat and
[7:28] in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
[7:30] drink
[7:31] let their table become a snare before
[7:33] them and that which should have been for
[7:35] their welfare let it become a trap
[7:38] let their eyes be darkened that they see
[7:40] not
[7:41] and make their loins continually to
[7:43] shake
[7:44] pour out thy indignation upon them and
[7:46] let thy wrathful anger take hold of them
[7:49] let their habitation be desolate and let
[7:52] none dwell in their tents
[7:54] for they persecute him whom thou hast
[7:56] smitten and they talk to the grief of
[7:58] those whom thou hast wounded
[8:00] add iniquity unto their iniquity and let
[8:03] them not come into thy righteousness
[8:05] let them be blotted out of the book of
[8:07] the living and not be written with the
[8:09] righteous
[8:11] when the jews rejected jesus there was a
[8:13] literal turning away of god from them to
[8:16] the gentiles
[8:17] acts 13 46-48
[8:21] then paul and barnabas waxed bold and
[8:23] said it was necessary that the word of
[8:25] god should first have been spoken to you
[8:28] but seeing ye put it from you and judge
[8:31] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[8:33] lo we turn to the gentiles
[8:36] for so hath the lord commanded us saying
[8:38] i have set thee to be a light of the
[8:40] gentiles that thou shouldst be for
[8:42] salvation unto the ends of the earth
[8:45] and when the gentiles heard this they
[8:47] were glad and glorified the word of the
[8:49] lord
[8:50] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[8:52] life believed
[8:55] this is not to suggest that there will
[8:56] be no more names from the tribes of
[8:58] israel remaining in the book of life for
[9:00] many of these but not multitudes through
[9:03] the principle of election will be in the
[9:05] gentile church age and come into the
[9:07] body of jesus christ showing that their
[9:10] names did indeed remain in the book of
[9:12] life
[9:13] also as we will show according to the
[9:15] fifth seal multitudes of martyred jews
[9:18] will be given white robes and eternal
[9:20] life by the lord also the hundred and
[9:23] forty four thousand will be sealed at
[9:25] his coming
[9:26] proving that their names were not
[9:28] deleted either
[9:29] but it is even as most accurately set
[9:31] forth in psalm 69
[9:33] that it is the wicked or unrighteous
[9:35] rejecters of christ and the destroyers
[9:37] of his people whose names are removed
[9:41] as israel chosen people of god
[9:44] in majority forfeited their rights in
[9:46] the book of life by rejecting jesus so
[9:48] the majority of the gentile church will
[9:50] also come into condemnation with the
[9:52] resultant removal of their names from
[9:54] the book of life by rejecting the word
[9:57] and thereby entering into the world
[9:59] ecumenical movement which is the image
[10:01] erected onto the beast
[10:04] there is another point to see here
[10:06] in the great white throne judgment there
[10:08] will be a separation of people
[10:10] the book of life will be opened and
[10:12] another book will be opened
[10:14] matthew 25 31-46
[10:18] when the son of man shall come in his
[10:20] glory and all the holy angels with him
[10:23] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[10:25] glory
[10:26] and before him shall be gathered all
[10:28] nations and he shall separate them one
[10:30] from another as a shepherd divideth his
[10:33] sheep from the goats
[10:34] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[10:36] hand but the goats on his left
[10:39] then shall the king say unto them on his
[10:41] right hand
[10:42] come ye blessed of my father inherit the
[10:45] kingdom prepared for you from the
[10:47] foundation of the world
[10:48] for i was unhungered and you gave me
[10:50] meat
[10:51] i was thirsty and you gave me drink
[10:54] i was a stranger and you took me in
[10:57] naked and ye clothed me
[10:59] i was sick and ye visited me
[11:01] i was in prison and ye came unto me
[11:04] then shall the righteous answer him
[11:05] saying
[11:06] lord when saw we thee and hungered and
[11:09] fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink
[11:12] when saw we thee a stranger and took me
[11:14] in
[11:15] or naked and clothed thee
[11:17] or when saw we thee sick or in prison
[11:19] and came unto thee
[11:21] and the king shall answer and say unto
[11:23] them
[11:24] verily i say unto you
[11:26] inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
[11:28] the least of these my brethren ye have
[11:31] done it unto me
[11:33] then shall he say also unto them on the
[11:35] left hand depart from me ye cursed into
[11:38] everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[11:41] and his angels
[11:42] for i was unhungered and you gave me no
[11:45] meat i was thirsty and you gave me no
[11:47] drink
[11:48] i was a stranger and you took me not in
[11:51] naked and ye clothed me not
[11:53] sick and in prison and ye visited me not
[11:57] then shall they also answer him saying
[11:59] lord when saw we thee and hungered or a
[12:02] thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or
[12:05] in prison
[12:06] and did not minister unto thee
[12:09] then shall he answer them saying
[12:11] verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did
[12:14] it not unto one of the least of these ye
[12:17] did it not unto me
[12:19] and these shall go away into everlasting
[12:21] punishment but the righteous into life
[12:24] eternal
[12:26] revelation 20 11-15
[12:29] and i saw a great white throne and him
[12:31] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[12:34] and the heaven fled away
[12:36] and there was found no place for them
[12:38] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[12:41] before god and the books were opened
[12:44] and another book was opened which is the
[12:46] book of life
[12:47] and the dead were judged out of those
[12:49] things which were written in the books
[12:51] according to their works and the sea
[12:53] gave up the dead which were in it
[12:55] and death and hell delivered up the dead
[12:57] which were in them
[12:59] and they were judged every man according
[13:01] to their works
[13:02] and death and hell were cast into the
[13:04] lake of fire this is the second death
[13:08] and whosoever was not found written in
[13:10] the book of life was cast into the lake
[13:12] of fire
[13:14] there will be both the righteous and the
[13:15] unrighteous in this judgment
[13:17] it says so
[13:19] these righteous will not be the bride
[13:21] for the bride sits with him in judgment
[13:24] first corinthians 6 2-3
[13:28] do ye not know that the saints shall
[13:30] judge the world
[13:32] and if the world shall be judged by you
[13:34] are ye unworthy to judge the smallest
[13:36] matters
[13:37] know ye not that we shall judge angels
[13:40] how much more things that pertain to
[13:41] this life
[13:43] revelation 3 21
[13:46] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[13:48] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[13:50] overcame and am set down with my father
[13:53] in his throne
[13:55] see the bride is with him in the throne
[13:58] as she is to judge the world she has to
[14:00] be sitting in the judgment with him
[14:02] that is exactly what daniel saw
[14:05] daniel 7 9-10
[14:08] i beheld till the thrones were cast down
[14:10] and the ancient of days did sit whose
[14:13] garment was white as snow
[14:15] and the hair of his head like the pure
[14:17] wool
[14:18] his throne was like the fiery flame and
[14:20] his wheels as burning fire
[14:22] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[14:25] from before him
[14:26] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[14:29] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[14:31] stood before him
[14:33] the judgment was set and the books were
[14:35] opened
[14:36] see it is the same scene for the
[14:38] thousand thousands who are ministering
[14:40] to him are the bride for who ministers
[14:43] to the husband but the wife
[14:46] the question now arises why are these
[14:48] righteous ones in the judgment
[14:50] there is no other place that they can
[14:52] come up
[14:53] for there are but two resurrections and
[14:55] since they could not qualify for the
[14:56] first resurrection they must come up in
[14:59] the second which is a resurrection unto
[15:01] judgment
[15:02] the ones who qualify for the first
[15:04] resurrection the bride are not in the
[15:06] judgment
[15:08] john 5 24
[15:10] verily verily i say unto you he that
[15:13] heareth my word and believeth on him
[15:15] that sent me hath everlasting life
[15:19] that is the believer is already the
[15:20] recipient of eternal life which he has
[15:23] in his possession now
[15:25] and shall not come into condemnation
[15:27] shall not come into the judgment is what
[15:29] it really says
[15:31] but is passed permanently from death
[15:33] unto life
[15:35] but notice carefully
[15:36] jesus must have yet another group in
[15:39] mind who had a certain resurrection will
[15:40] receive eternal life
[15:42] they will receive it at the resurrection
[15:45] not having previously received it as a
[15:47] member of the bride
[15:49] john 5 28-29
[15:52] marvel not at this for the hour is
[15:54] coming into which all that are in the
[15:56] graves shall hear his voice and shall
[15:58] come forth
[16:00] they that have done good unto the
[16:02] resurrection of life
[16:04] and they that have done evil unto the
[16:06] resurrection of damnation
[16:08] now we all know that john 5 28-29 is not
[16:12] the rapture
[16:13] for only the dead in christ will arise
[16:15] from the graves at that time along with
[16:17] the living bride who still is on the
[16:19] earth
[16:20] first thessalonians 4 16-17
[16:24] for the lord himself shall descend from
[16:27] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[16:29] the archangel
[16:30] and with the trump of god
[16:32] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[16:35] then we which are alive and remain shall
[16:37] be caught up together with them in the
[16:39] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[16:42] so shall we ever be with the lord
[16:45] but it says in john 5 28-29
[16:49] that all are going to come forth from
[16:51] the grave
[16:52] this is the very same resurrection that
[16:54] is spoken of in revelation 20 11-15
[16:58] wherein the dead were brought before the
[17:00] lord and judged according to their works
[17:03] and all whose names were not in the book
[17:05] of life were then cast into the lake of
[17:07] fire
[17:09] we now face the question as to why they
[17:11] should be given eternal life at the
[17:13] judgment since the epistles seem to
[17:15] conclusively point out that one must
[17:17] possess the spirit of christ or perish
[17:20] though it seems thus we must not
[17:22] discredit the words of jesus who most
[17:24] pointedly sets forth that there are some
[17:27] found in the book of life who will
[17:29] either receive eternal life before the
[17:31] general resurrection or after it
[17:33] paul does not evade this truth for he
[17:36] most clearly says in philippians 3 11
[17:40] if by any means i might attain to the
[17:42] resurrection of the dead
[17:44] now this statement is most peculiar
[17:46] we all know that we are all going to be
[17:49] in a resurrection whether we want to be
[17:51] or not
[17:52] all will be resurrected
[17:54] so paul could hardly be saying
[17:56] if by any means i might attain to a
[17:58] resurrection of the dead
[18:00] the truth of the matter is he is not
[18:02] saying that
[18:04] the literal reading is
[18:05] if by any means i might attain to the
[18:08] out resurrection from among the dead
[18:11] this is not the attaining to the general
[18:13] or second resurrection but attaining to
[18:15] the first resurrection of which is said
[18:18] blessed and holy is he who hath part in
[18:21] the first resurrection on such the
[18:23] second death hath no power
[18:25] but they shall be priests of god and of
[18:27] christ
[18:28] and shall reign with him a thousand
[18:30] years
[18:32] the first resurrection has nothing to do
[18:34] with the second death
[18:36] that is at the end of the thousand years
[18:38] when all the rest of the dead live again
[18:41] and in that day there will be those who
[18:43] come forth to eternal life and those
[18:45] others who are caught in the second
[18:47] death
[18:48] now we do not need to guess about those
[18:50] who in the second resurrection are given
[18:51] life
[18:52] we are told it is given to them on the
[18:54] grounds that they have been kind and
[18:56] good to the brethren
[18:58] those who are raised and cast into the
[19:00] lake of fire will be so treated because
[19:03] of their mistreatment of the brethren
[19:06] since this is the word of god we simply
[19:08] accept it there is no argument here just
[19:11] a simple statement of fact
[19:13] to further clarify notice specifically
[19:16] the words of matthew 25 31-46
[19:20] it does not say that a shepherd is
[19:22] literally separating sheep from goats
[19:25] but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep
[19:27] from goats
[19:28] these are not sheep in this particular
[19:30] area of time
[19:32] white throne judgment
[19:34] the sheep are in his fold they heard his
[19:36] voice word and they followed him
[19:39] they already have eternal life and
[19:41] cannot come into the judgment
[19:44] but these do not have eternal life
[19:46] and they are in the judgment
[19:48] they are allowed to go into eternal life
[19:52] but upon what grounds do they enter into
[19:54] life eternal
[19:56] certainly not upon the fact that they
[19:57] already have his life as does the bride
[20:00] but they receive it because they were
[20:02] kind to his brethren
[20:04] they are not his brethren that would
[20:06] make them joint heirs with jesus
[20:09] they are not heirs to anything but life
[20:12] they share no throne etc with him
[20:15] their names must have been in the book
[20:17] of life and not
[20:18] removed now because of their love of the
[20:21] people of god they are recognized and
[20:23] saved
[20:24] no doubt these served and helped the
[20:26] children of god
[20:27] perhaps like nicodemus and gamaliel they
[20:29] stood for the children in a time of
[20:31] trouble
[20:33] if this seems to smack of restoration
[20:35] watch carefully now for the wicked are
[20:37] not restored but turned into the lake of
[20:39] fire
[20:41] the names of many of those destroyed
[20:43] were in the book of life also
[20:45] but they were blotted out because they
[20:46] failed to honor the people of god who
[20:48] were the living manifested word
[20:51] living epistles for their day
[20:54] now let us be very clear here
[20:57] these are not nations being judged and
[20:59] going into the millennium because they
[21:01] have harbored and helped the jews
[21:03] that is very clear because of the
[21:05] conclusion of these verses
[21:07] and these the wicked
[21:09] shall go away into everlasting
[21:11] punishment like a fire but the righteous
[21:15] into everlasting life
[21:17] there is no record of two judgments set
[21:19] where the wicked are cast into the lake
[21:21] of fire
[21:22] only the beast and false prophet are
[21:24] judged at the end of the great
[21:26] tribulation
[21:27] no this is the white throne judgment and
[21:30] they are judged according to what is
[21:31] written in the books
[21:33] it is the second resurrection that the
[21:35] souls under the altar as set forth in
[21:38] the fifth seal revelation 6 9-11 are
[21:42] given white robes and of course eternal
[21:44] life or there would be no point of white
[21:46] robes
[21:48] and when he had opened the fifth seal i
[21:50] saw under the altar the souls of them
[21:52] that were slain for the word of god and
[21:54] for the testimony which they held
[21:57] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[21:59] how long o lord holy and true thus thou
[22:03] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[22:05] that dwell on the earth
[22:06] and white robes were given unto every
[22:08] one of them
[22:10] and it was said unto them that they
[22:12] should rest yet for a little season
[22:14] until their fellow servants also and
[22:15] their brethren that should be killed as
[22:18] they were should be fulfilled
[22:20] now note particularly that none of these
[22:22] under the altar were killed for the
[22:24] testimony to jesus they were not like
[22:26] antipas who was slain for holding fast
[22:28] his name
[22:30] these are not born again ones with
[22:32] eternal life as their possession
[22:34] they come up in the resurrection and
[22:36] receive life because of their stand on
[22:38] the word
[22:39] and notice how these are crying out for
[22:41] vengeance
[22:42] they cannot be bride material the bride
[22:45] turns the cheek and cries
[22:47] forgive them father they know not what
[22:49] they do
[22:50] these are jews
[22:52] they have to be because they are in the
[22:54] fifth seal and it is in the fourth seal
[22:56] that the gentile bride is gone in the
[22:58] rapture
[23:00] so these jews aren't born of his spirit
[23:02] they don't even believe that jesus is
[23:04] the messiah
[23:06] but as they were blinded by god for the
[23:08] gentile's sake
[23:09] god gave them eternal life on the
[23:11] grounds that though they could not come
[23:13] to him
[23:14] yet they were truly faithful to all the
[23:16] word they knew and died for it as
[23:19] multitudes died under hitler stalin etc
[23:22] and will yet die
[23:24] it is the second resurrection wherein
[23:26] the five foolish virgins come up
[23:28] notice that they were virgins
[23:30] they did not have the holy spirit so
[23:32] they missed being in the bride while the
[23:35] five wise who had oil became a part of
[23:37] that bride
[23:38] but these people being a separated god
[23:41] loving people and trying to abide in the
[23:43] word according to what they knew of it
[23:45] and being a help in the work of the lord
[23:48] will come up at the end of time they
[23:50] will miss the millennium which you can
[23:52] begin to see by these truths is much
[23:54] more important and wonderful than we
[23:56] have ever thought or believed
[23:59] all these people had their names in the
[24:00] book of life and their names remained
[24:03] but whose names did not remain
[24:05] those of the world system churches who
[24:07] fought the bride will be those whose
[24:09] names are removed
[24:11] that is who will lose out they will be
[24:13] cast into the lake of fire
[24:16] now let us go another step but before we
[24:18] do let us review our case thus far
[24:21] first of all we know most assuredly that
[24:23] the purpose of god stands in election
[24:26] it was purposed in himself
[24:28] it was god's purpose to bring forth a
[24:30] people like unto himself that would be a
[24:32] word bride
[24:34] she was chosen before the foundation of
[24:35] the world in him
[24:37] she was for known and beloved before she
[24:39] was ever brought forth during the ages
[24:41] upon the earth
[24:43] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[24:45] never come into condemnation
[24:48] she can never be in the judgment because
[24:49] sin cannot be imputed unto her
[24:52] romans 4 8
[24:55] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[24:57] not impute sin
[24:59] but indeed she shall be with him in his
[25:01] throne of judgment judging the world and
[25:03] even angels
[25:04] her name each of her members was written
[25:08] in a section of the lamb's book of life
[25:09] before the foundation of the world
[25:12] secondly there is another class
[25:14] their names are also in the book of life
[25:16] and they will come up in the second
[25:18] resurrection
[25:19] such are the foolish virgins and the
[25:21] righteous as are spoken of in matthew
[25:23] 25.
[25:25] in this class also are those who do not
[25:27] worship the beast or become involved in
[25:29] the antichrist system but die for their
[25:32] faith even though they are not in the
[25:33] bride not having been born again
[25:37] but they will come up in the second
[25:38] resurrection and go into eternal life
[25:42] thirdly there are the borderline
[25:43] christians such as we saw in israel
[25:45] coming out of egypt
[25:47] these had their names in the book of
[25:49] life and their works written in the
[25:50] books
[25:51] these having failed to obey god and
[25:53] being void of the spirit though even the
[25:56] signs and wonders were amongst them will
[25:58] have their names removed from the book
[26:00] of life
[26:01] amongst this group will be the ones like
[26:03] judas who though entirely void of the
[26:05] spirit but are religious will have
[26:07] manifestation in their lives
[26:09] and though on the books were not the
[26:11] elected in him
[26:13] such also as balaam will be in that
[26:15] group
[26:17] fourth and finally are the ones whose
[26:18] names have never been or will ever be
[26:21] written on the books
[26:22] such are found in revelation 13 8 and
[26:25] revelation 17 8
[26:28] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[26:30] worship him whose names are not written
[26:32] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[26:34] from the foundation of the world
[26:36] the beast that thou sawest was and is
[26:38] not and shall ascend out of the
[26:40] bottomless pit and go into perdition
[26:43] and they that dwell on the earth shall
[26:45] wonder whose names were not written in
[26:47] the book of life from the foundation of
[26:49] the world
[26:50] when they behold the beast that was and
[26:53] is not and yet is
[26:55] jesus said that a certain group would
[26:57] accept one who came in his own name
[27:00] that one is the antichrist
[27:03] and that is exactly what it says of them
[27:05] in revelation thirteen eight and
[27:07] seventeen eight
[27:09] these were ordained of god but not unto
[27:11] election
[27:12] and with this group is such that are as
[27:14] pharaoh
[27:16] it says of him
[27:17] even for this same purpose have i raised
[27:20] thee up
[27:21] vessels of wrath fitted for destruction
[27:24] romans 9 17 and 22
[27:27] none of these would be placed on the
[27:29] records of life
[27:30] i am not saying that there is no record
[27:32] of them
[27:33] no doubt there is some kind of a record
[27:35] of them but not in the records of life
[27:38] their purpose of existence has been
[27:40] dealt with slightly in the rest of this
[27:42] book but we can add two more scriptures
[27:44] proverbs 16 4
[27:47] the lord hath made the wicked for the
[27:49] day of evil
[27:50] job 21 30
[27:53] the wicked is reserved for the day of
[27:54] destruction they shall be brought forth
[27:57] in the day of wrath
[28:04] [Music]
[28:34] you
