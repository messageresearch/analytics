[39:26] know psalms and that's
[39:28] this this the song i sing believe or not
[39:30] it's all scriptural
[39:31] it's almost it's i mean almost word for
[39:34] word king james
[39:35] i think there's one word that was just
[39:37] altered slightly
[39:39] um and it was like instead of four it
[39:42] was thou
[39:43] but it in psalms 92 1
[39:46] it says it's a good thing to give thanks
[39:50] to the lord and to sing praises unto his
[39:53] name
[39:54] and i just want to praise the lord and i
[39:57] want to give thanks
[39:58] uh 16 months ago i was let go at my job
[40:03] and for 16 months i've lived on
[40:06] unemployment and if it wasn't for the
[40:08] pandemic
[40:10] i'd have been in trouble long time ago
[40:12] so i
[40:13] i mean i i'm wondering if this pandemic
[40:15] wasn't for me
[40:16] because this whole time i've had
[40:17] unemployment and so i just thank the
[40:20] lord for that
[40:21] but anyway i so i had applied for a job
[40:24] i've applied for a lot of jobs
[40:26] probably not nearly as many as i should
[40:28] have but i just i don't know i
[40:30] but i so i applied for this job i
[40:32] actually applied for a job where
[40:33] where kelly works uh independent school
[40:35] district 196
[40:37] and so i
[40:40] um i had a couple interviews and

[40:50] i've got
[40:51] i've got a criminal record and it's not
[40:54] a good criminal record it's

[41:17] to thank all of you who have been

[54:06] i want to take a little talk here
[54:08] tonight
[54:11] i want to begin one tonight i don't know
[54:13] when i'm going to end
[54:16] but uh i just want to start
[54:19] begin to talk tonight and based on this
[54:23] thought
[54:24] as i was thinking about it what i want
[54:27] us to do uh
[54:28] i'm very well sure uh brother jordan did
[54:32] we
[54:33] we come to the end of daniel 70 week
[54:35] this gun sunday
[54:37] okay if you will allow me now i will i
[54:39] would love for us to go right
[54:41] into the church book but
[54:44] not the revelation series
[54:47] not the revelation series i want for us
[54:49] to go directly
[54:50] into the church book itself and
[54:55] and that being said some years back
[55:03] we bought some some church box that we
[55:06] were using
[55:07] uh for witnessing purpose when uh
[55:11] we were having our meeting somewhere
[55:13] there in bloomington
[55:14] and then uh we we kept on so
[55:18] if you want to church each book which of
[55:20] course it would be good for you to have
[55:22] a copy
[55:23] and uh and because we bought it we're
[55:26] going to sell it to you
[55:29] praise the lord so if you want
[55:33] one of one of it you uh uh just make
[55:36] contact with brother
[55:37] steve cassidy i don't know how how many
[55:39] copies we have
[55:40] i know we have a few on the shelf i
[55:42] should have a few
[55:44] in a box somewhere i'm not sure but if
[55:47] you have your own personal church age
[55:49] book
[55:50] uh it would be good for you to come with
[55:52] it i mean
[55:53] uh we will keep projecting the words but
[55:56] you cannot underline the
[55:57] we don't want the wall to be dead so uh
[56:03] unless you want to bring your notebook
[56:05] and take note that will also be
[56:07] good but uh i believe that it would be a
[56:10] good thing for us to
[56:12] to uh go through the church ages since
[56:15] we have just went through daniel 70 week
[56:18] now the church book the the printed copy
[56:22] [Music]
[56:24] is is a very resourceful book
[56:28] uh it holds all the major doctrines
[56:33] uh of of the bible and also that are
[56:36] around the message it holds uh uh
[56:40] some of the the teachings and
[56:46] so it would be good for you to have your
[56:48] own personal carpet if you're done
[56:51] and if you want to if you want to
[56:54] contact voice of god to buy yours it's
[56:56] okay you want to go on
[56:58] amazon i think they stay happy there
[57:00] it's okay
[57:02] and but it would be good i would just
[57:04] encourage you
[57:05] to to be able to get one
[57:08] and uh
[57:12] tonight and then also on sunday
[57:15] because of the the heat wave that might
[57:18] be coming
[57:19] to us
[57:25] we will have our regular service i'm not
[57:28] sure
[57:28] uh i will not want to to keep you long
[57:33] so we'll have our regular service go out
[57:36] and fellowship
[57:37] and then we will go home so we will now
[57:41] go out and then come back
[57:43] in the building again for another
[57:45] evening service or community service
[57:47] we will find a time and we will schedule
[57:49] that and let you know
[57:51] but we will allow people that want to
[57:54] stay around to fellowship
[57:56] share whatever we bring to share
[58:00] we are encouraged to bring something to
[58:02] share with one another
[58:04] and at least we'll have that opportunity
[58:06] to spend time together
[58:09] until the lord can be able to to bless
[58:13] us
[58:14] with a church where we have a fellowship
[58:15] hall we will use the little that we have
[58:18] for now
[58:19] praise the lord i want to take a little
[58:21] thought here tonight
[58:23] [Music]
[58:25] here i have an ear let him hear
[58:30] what the spirit says onto the church
[58:34] praise the lord
[58:38] we realize that
[58:45] just have a dry throat tonight
[58:48] we realized that when you look in the in
[58:51] in the scripture
[59:00] our lord jesus
[59:06] spoke to the seven churches
[59:10] and every time he gave his message as we
[59:13] studied the church age together you will
[59:15] realize that brother branham says
[59:17] to every age there was a message
[59:21] in the message what does that mean he
[59:24] said
[59:24] god gave a message to the age in general
[59:28] but there was a message for the people
[59:30] of god in that age
[59:33] praise the lord to our age
[59:37] he spoke to the age and said you are
[59:39] rich you are miserable
[59:40] you are blind you are naked he says but
[59:44] to the illet
[59:44] in that age he says uh
[59:48] be zealious therefore and repent because
[59:51] it's only the elite
[59:52] that can repent praise the lord
[59:55] so to every age god addressed the age in
[59:59] general
[1:00:00] and he also addresses people in the age
[1:00:04] but this was a message that he says to
[1:00:07] every age he to have an ear
[1:00:10] let him hear what the spirit says to the
[1:00:12] church
[1:00:13] but it's also very
[1:00:18] amazing to realize that
[1:00:22] before the messages to the seventh
[1:00:26] church age
[1:00:28] the gospel also recalled it
[1:00:34] seven times in the gospel
[1:00:37] marty mike luke there are seven
[1:00:40] times word this very statement
[1:00:44] is also repeated he the heaven ears
[1:00:49] let's take our bible and travel a little
[1:00:50] bit
[1:00:52] matthew chapter 11.
[1:01:02] are we together
[1:01:12] matthew chapter 11 let's read from verse
[1:01:14] 12.
[1:01:23] and from the days of john the baptist
[1:01:26] until now the kingdom of heaven suffer
[1:01:28] violence
[1:01:30] and the violent ticket it by force
[1:01:33] for all the prophets
[1:01:36] and the law prophesied until john
[1:01:41] and if you will receive it this is
[1:01:44] this is elias which was
[1:01:48] for to come he they have an ear
[1:01:53] led him here praise the lord
[1:01:57] are we together matthew chapter 13.
[1:02:18] matthew chapter 13.
[1:02:25] are we together
[1:02:35] now you will see i have a little
[1:02:42] i have i have my note i was telling the
[1:02:45] matthew chapter 13.
[1:02:49] in matthew chapter 13
[1:02:53] jesus speaks about the parable
[1:02:59] he speaks a parable
[1:03:02] that talks about the soul
[1:03:07] and you realize that in matthew chapter
[1:03:11] 13 when you when you
[1:03:13] when you study that the entire chapter
[1:03:17] jesus brings out
[1:03:20] seven different parables
[1:03:24] concerning the kingdom but from the
[1:03:27] first one
[1:03:29] verse 3 where he says and he speak many
[1:03:31] things
[1:03:32] unto them in parables saying behold a
[1:03:35] soul went forth
[1:03:36] to soul praise the lord
[1:03:40] and then he talks about you know uh the
[1:03:44] different condition
[1:03:45] of the soil praise the lord
[1:03:49] the different condition of the soil
[1:03:52] and what i also want you to realize is
[1:03:56] that jesus
[1:03:57] talking about a different condition of
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:00] of the soil and we know
[1:04:03] that as he speaks of that
[1:04:07] he was speaking about the condition of
[1:04:11] the heart that the word comes to because
[1:04:13] we know that the seed
[1:04:15] the word which is the incorruptible seed
[1:04:17] is planted in the soul
[1:04:19] of man so he was speaking about the
[1:04:22] condition
[1:04:23] uh the different conditions of
[1:04:26] the heart that the word comes to
[1:04:30] now so you think about it now as we talk
[1:04:33] as we
[1:04:33] as we talk on the subject of he that
[1:04:36] have an
[1:04:36] ear let him hear what the spirit is here
[1:04:40] onto the church it's true with our ears
[1:04:43] we hear
[1:04:44] but the word is is the destiny of the
[1:04:47] word is for the heart
[1:04:49] praise the lord so jesus talks about the
[1:04:53] different conditions
[1:04:54] here that he that he typed the sower
[1:04:57] went full to seoul
[1:04:58] verse 40 and when he saw some seeds fell
[1:05:02] by the wayside and the fowls came and
[1:05:05] evolved them and some fell
[1:05:06] on sunday places where they had
[1:05:10] no martial earth
[1:05:13] and fought wave they sprung up
[1:05:17] because they had no deepness
[1:05:22] of earth and when the sun was
[1:05:25] up there was couch and because they had
[1:05:28] no roots
[1:05:30] they were away and some fell among
[1:05:33] toms and the tones sprung
[1:05:36] up and choked them but
[1:05:40] other fell into good ground and brought
[1:05:43] for good fruits
[1:05:45] some a hundredfold some
[1:05:48] 64 psalm 34.
[1:05:55] who have an ear let him hear
[1:06:00] as i'm reading this there are just some
[1:06:01] few things that is catching my mind
[1:06:04] look in verse 8 also you will realize as
[1:06:07] jesus
[1:06:08] talks about the seed that fall
[1:06:11] in good ground and brought forth
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:16] and brought forth he talks about it
[1:06:19] this way in the sense of
[1:06:22] hungerforth zesty and teddy
[1:06:26] and every time he used this in the
[1:06:28] scripture
[1:06:29] is not in an ascending order
[1:06:32] is in a descending order
[1:06:40] praise the lord every time you look
[1:06:42] through the scripture every time
[1:06:44] jesus uses this is never in an ascending
[1:06:47] order
[1:06:49] it's always in a descending order
[1:06:53] give that to the back of your mind we
[1:06:54] will visit that
[1:06:59] who have an ear let him hear
[1:07:03] and then in verse 43.
[1:07:25] verse 41 the son of man shall send his
[1:07:28] sent forth his angels and they shall
[1:07:30] gather
[1:07:31] out of his kingdom all things
[1:07:34] that offend and then we should do
[1:07:36] iniquity
[1:07:38] and shall cast them out and shall cast
[1:07:42] him
[1:07:42] into a furnace of fire there shall be
[1:07:46] willing
[1:07:47] and glancing of teeth then shall the
[1:07:50] rashes shine forth
[1:07:52] as the sun in the kingdom
[1:07:56] of their father who have an ear
[1:08:01] let him hear praise the lord
[1:08:05] i'll give you the rest of the other
[1:08:06] verses you can go and check them out
[1:08:08] mark chapter 4
[1:08:10] that verse 9 and also in verse 23
[1:08:14] luke chapter 8 verse 8
[1:08:18] luke chapter 14 verse 35
[1:08:22] seven times in the gospel
[1:08:29] is repeated praise the lord
[1:08:39] now so as as we look at this just like i
[1:08:42] said i'm just i'm just trying to start
[1:08:44] this
[1:08:45] because when i was studying that last
[1:08:48] night
[1:08:50] and i've been looking at the subject for
[1:08:52] a while but i was i was trying to look
[1:08:54] close and i was trying to go through
[1:08:57] uh uh every church age and see and see
[1:09:00] some of the things that brother branham
[1:09:01] said
[1:09:02] but it kind of felt amazed me that
[1:09:05] brother branham
[1:09:06] took this subject of he that have an ear
[1:09:10] let him hear he took the subject
[1:09:15] and he dealt with it in different ways
[1:09:19] as we go along you will see he dealt
[1:09:22] with it
[1:09:23] as the individual praise the lord
[1:09:28] he took he that have an ear then there
[1:09:30] with
[1:09:31] it as an individual and in another
[1:09:34] church edge he said
[1:09:37] the scripture says he that have an ear
[1:09:39] let him hear what the spirit says
[1:09:42] unto the church so he also dealt with
[1:09:46] it as the church listening to its
[1:09:50] messenger the individual listening to
[1:09:54] christ
[1:09:55] the church listening to his messenger
[1:10:01] praise the lord so as as we go ahead
[1:10:05] you we we we will we will be able to
[1:10:07] pick up some of those things and
[1:10:08] and and show them to you but i took
[1:10:12] i took few quotes that i will use
[1:10:15] tonight
[1:10:16] for this uh uh prayer meeting and
[1:10:19] uh and and then we will look at them
[1:10:21] together
[1:10:24] but you know
[1:10:27] it's it's a kind of a
[1:10:31] statement that tells you
[1:10:34] to pay attention
[1:10:38] it's almost like the parents say are you
[1:10:40] listening are you listening to me
[1:10:45] is i mean it's a it's a statement that
[1:10:49] tells you
[1:10:50] you have to pay attention
[1:10:55] praise the lord he'd have an ear
[1:10:59] let him hear what the spirit
[1:11:03] says to the church
[1:11:07] let me take this uh from the ephesian
[1:11:10] church agent
[1:11:12] and we can get on our way here
[1:11:15] verb says he that have an ear
[1:11:18] let him hear what the spirit seared onto
[1:11:21] the churches
[1:11:28] it may be that million will hear these
[1:11:31] words
[1:11:31] or reading but how many will pay heed
[1:11:37] to them
[1:11:41] how many will pay attention
[1:11:44] to what the spirit is saying
[1:11:50] praise the lord
[1:12:01] that we do not know
[1:12:04] but he
[1:12:08] who will land his ears and
[1:12:11] want to know the words of truth
[1:12:15] will find the spirit of god
[1:12:18] enlightening him
[1:12:23] praise the lord amen
[1:12:26] i read that again he'd
[1:12:29] have an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:12:32] said unto the churches
[1:12:34] it may be that million will hear
[1:12:37] these words or reading
[1:12:40] but how many will pay he to them
[1:12:45] that we do not know but he
[1:12:48] the individual
[1:12:52] who will lend his ears
[1:12:56] and want to know have
[1:12:59] a desire to know
[1:13:05] the words of truth will
[1:13:08] find the spirit of god
[1:13:11] enlightening him
[1:13:15] praise the lord now this does not make
[1:13:19] it
[1:13:21] a congregation i said
[1:13:25] it makes it an individual affair
[1:13:33] and we realized that
[1:13:38] some and many has come short of this
[1:13:43] because the way that meaning takes the
[1:13:46] word of god
[1:13:47] or even it takes the message of the hour
[1:13:50] is more like black letters
[1:13:54] written on white paper
[1:13:59] praise the lord and we can read it and
[1:14:02] even know
[1:14:02] the date that brother branham shared it
[1:14:05] we can know the year
[1:14:07] 1952 or 1963 or whatever year
[1:14:11] and sometimes it's so easy for us to
[1:14:13] stop told the letters
[1:14:15] on the paper
[1:14:21] praise the lord
[1:14:24] but if the message of the hour is the
[1:14:27] voice of god
[1:14:30] then god keeps speaking
[1:14:33] and the way that god speaks is to
[1:14:36] enlighten
[1:14:37] us what does that mean is to bring the
[1:14:40] word
[1:14:41] out of the pages and make it real to us
[1:14:50] now so brother branham says the ones
[1:14:53] that will learn their ears
[1:14:56] and want to know the words of truth will
[1:14:59] find the
[1:15:00] spirit of god in the most simplest way
[1:15:07] begin to enlighten them
[1:15:11] all that they have heard all of their
[1:15:13] years
[1:15:15] now starting to become clear to them
[1:15:21] praise the lord and you see that's the
[1:15:24] reason why
[1:15:26] young people i says that over and over
[1:15:28] and i encourage you all the time
[1:15:31] you know read your bible
[1:15:38] praise the lord listen to the message
[1:15:45] because brother branham said
[1:15:48] as we walk in the light he said
[1:15:52] more will unfold
[1:15:56] as we continue in the world
[1:16:02] many try to school themselves by the
[1:16:04] message
[1:16:06] and think that they can memorize courts
[1:16:10] they can memorize dates they can
[1:16:12] memorize
[1:16:13] paragraph the message is not for that
[1:16:20] the lord and whenever the person try to
[1:16:24] do that is just
[1:16:25] it's just maybe trying to make
[1:16:27] themselves
[1:16:28] to be smarter than other another person
[1:16:36] but let's go ahead a little bit here he
[1:16:38] says you find the spirit of god
[1:16:41] enlightening him if your ears
[1:16:45] is open to the word the
[1:16:48] spirit of god will make the word
[1:16:51] real to you
[1:16:56] praise the lord if your ears is open
[1:17:00] for the word the spirit of god will
[1:17:03] make the word real to you
[1:17:12] now that's that is a work of the spirit
[1:17:17] i can teach you the truth but
[1:17:21] if you don't open your ears to hear it
[1:17:25] and your heart to receive it
[1:17:29] you won't get the revelation
[1:17:36] praise the lord
[1:17:40] amen that's the thing about you know the
[1:17:44] word that's the thing about the
[1:17:46] the you know the uh the message of the
[1:17:50] hour you know it's not uh
[1:17:53] just like i said it's not uh schooling
[1:17:57] ourselves
[1:17:58] you know to to i mean just to be able
[1:18:02] to say like the way brother branham said
[1:18:04] it that's that's what we must do we must
[1:18:06] say what the tape says
[1:18:08] praise the lord by saying that
[1:18:11] what the tape says with our revelation
[1:18:13] you can be even more dangerous
[1:18:17] now let's take another one yeah
[1:18:23] verb say he'd have an ear let him hear
[1:18:26] what the spirit spirit onto the churches
[1:18:29] now one of the things that caught my
[1:18:31] attention
[1:18:32] here is that you know
[1:18:36] uh uh i mean some of you know
[1:18:40] know that they all noticed that and you
[1:18:42] know over the years
[1:18:44] it is it's so easy for us
[1:18:48] to be accepted or a person to be
[1:18:51] accepted or a preacher
[1:18:53] that want to be accepted that want his
[1:18:56] idea to be accepted
[1:18:57] it's so easy for him to say brother
[1:19:00] branham said
[1:19:02] amen and then
[1:19:06] he just paraphrased something or he just
[1:19:09] says something way offline but because
[1:19:13] he says brother branham said
[1:19:16] and the people love what brother branham
[1:19:20] said they say amy
[1:19:25] praise the lord
[1:19:29] and sometimes it's very far from what
[1:19:31] brother branham said
[1:19:34] and sometimes brother brandon never even
[1:19:36] said it
[1:19:43] that's how we have all our false
[1:19:45] doctrines and false teachings
[1:19:49] it's almost just like saul saying
[1:19:53] me and samir
[1:19:57] praise the lord he wanted to gain the
[1:19:59] confidence of the people
[1:20:01] so he had to associate himself with
[1:20:04] samya
[1:20:08] when that was now what samuel instructed
[1:20:10] him to do
[1:20:13] well he knew that the people knew that
[1:20:15] samuel was a seal
[1:20:18] so if he can just associate himself
[1:20:21] and that is the reason why we may have
[1:20:24] an
[1:20:25] ear to hear what the spirit is saying
[1:20:28] not what the man is saying
[1:20:33] what the spirit is saying
[1:20:36] a person can say something that has a
[1:20:39] good idea in it
[1:20:41] and yet it's far from scripture
[1:20:47] praise the lord but you know one good
[1:20:50] thing there
[1:20:51] is that the spirit bear record
[1:20:54] amen
[1:20:59] sometimes you don't get it right there
[1:21:01] when the person says it
[1:21:04] but because you are listening to what
[1:21:05] the spirit says
[1:21:07] you pick it up later
[1:21:10] you see that thing he said no i get
[1:21:13] problem with him
[1:21:20] he'd have an ear let him hear what the
[1:21:22] spirit said unto the churches
[1:21:30] brother branham says how
[1:21:34] tragic it is that the first
[1:21:38] age did not listen
[1:21:41] to the spirit instead a listening to
[1:21:45] men
[1:21:48] but thank god
[1:21:52] in the last age there will be a
[1:21:56] group rise up
[1:21:59] the truth bride of the last dane
[1:22:03] and she will listen to
[1:22:07] what the s she will she will listen to
[1:22:10] the spirit
[1:22:11] in that day of gross darkness
[1:22:16] the light will return
[1:22:19] by the peel word and
[1:22:22] we will return to the power of pentecost
[1:22:27] to welcome back the lord jesus christ
[1:22:32] praise the lord amen
[1:22:36] now so a behold us
[1:22:42] as the bride of the last day
[1:22:45] to listen to what the spirit
[1:22:50] says
[1:22:59] or you will see how how important it is
[1:23:04] to be able to tone our mind to what the
[1:23:08] spirit says
[1:23:09] for us to get to this place and enjoy
[1:23:13] listening to that stay small voice
[1:23:16] identifying the voice of god
[1:23:21] praise the lord because that's what the
[1:23:23] holy ghost is giving for
[1:23:28] the holy ghost is giving for you to be
[1:23:30] able to identify the voice of god he
[1:23:33] says i will
[1:23:34] i will lead you into all truth i will
[1:23:36] guide you how will god
[1:23:37] guide you how will he lead you how will
[1:23:39] he instruct you if you can listen
[1:23:46] praise the lord
[1:23:52] i mean it's it's it's just uh it it you
[1:23:55] know what
[1:23:55] uh kind of a funny thing a brother
[1:23:59] was asking me some question and that you
[1:24:01] know we were talking
[1:24:02] you know then he uh uh i mean uh people
[1:24:06] just get uh you know they get into all
[1:24:08] of these uh
[1:24:09] uh uh facebook and youtube things
[1:24:12] and uh and i mean it's just a sad thing
[1:24:15] that you know
[1:24:16] even even come to the place where people
[1:24:19] that are preparing to go
[1:24:21] into a rapture
[1:24:26] waiting for a body change
[1:24:31] let's go back to enoch he was the first
[1:24:34] man that experienced a body change
[1:24:37] he was the first man that experienced a
[1:24:40] translation
[1:24:43] and the bible testified that he walked
[1:24:46] with god
[1:24:47] how will eno walk with god unless he
[1:24:50] identified the voice of god in his day
[1:24:54] unless he identified god's instruction
[1:25:01] if he was working and god comes by the
[1:25:03] lawn and say you know
[1:25:04] let's go for a walk
[1:25:08] and he just left what he he was doing
[1:25:10] and just and just started walking
[1:25:12] brother brandon when when you steady in
[1:25:14] a walk brother adam tied that toe
[1:25:17] the life that he lived
[1:25:22] it was not getting on the street of
[1:25:24] minneapolis walking from your house
[1:25:26] downtown to singapore
[1:25:27] it was in his life his manner of life
[1:25:33] identifying the voice of god
[1:25:51] what brandon says in year the first
[1:25:54] age did not listen to the spirit
[1:26:01] and if you said it down there he talks
[1:26:03] about and that's
[1:26:05] where it comes the deeds of the
[1:26:06] nicolaitan and you know the doctrine of
[1:26:09] bilaam and the rest of them
[1:26:10] just like i said when we go through the
[1:26:12] church ages we will learn all of that
[1:26:16] but to see what it will take
[1:26:22] for the rapture what it would take to
[1:26:25] condition
[1:26:26] us to get out of here
[1:26:34] is listening to that voice of god
[1:26:42] turning ourselves to listening when god
[1:26:48] speaks
[1:26:51] i mean it's such a blessing to be able
[1:26:53] to identify
[1:26:55] when god speaks to you
[1:27:00] praise the lord to count yourself a
[1:27:04] privilege and know that
[1:27:16] he said the true bride of the last day
[1:27:20] and she will listen to the spirit
[1:27:26] in that day of gross darkness
[1:27:30] which is our day
[1:27:36] with all the darkness that is around us
[1:27:39] praise the lord
[1:27:44] the light will return by
[1:27:47] the pure word not some kind of a man
[1:27:54] ideas but a pure word
[1:27:59] not trying to start a pentecost move
[1:28:05] but getting back to what malachi 4 have
[1:28:08] said
[1:28:12] and we will return back to the power of
[1:28:14] pentecost
[1:28:16] to welcome back our lord jesus christ
[1:28:26] like take this let's take the next
[1:28:30] chord like i said this is just an
[1:28:32] introduction to this subject
[1:28:36] here i have an ear let him hear
[1:28:40] what the spirit spirit to the churches
[1:28:43] in each age
[1:28:46] in every age
[1:28:49] it was the same cry
[1:28:53] year what the spirit says
[1:28:57] think about it now we have just read
[1:29:01] record where even before the holy ghost
[1:29:05] came
[1:29:07] jesus started echoing to the disciples
[1:29:12] he'd have an ear praise
[1:29:16] lord amen
[1:29:20] because even when you look at matthew
[1:29:22] chapter 13
[1:29:24] the bible says he spoke in parables
[1:29:31] and then after he said all of these
[1:29:33] things in parables
[1:29:35] he came over and pull his disciples
[1:29:38] aside there's this there's a scripture
[1:29:40] pattern that you have to watch also you
[1:29:44] go back to matthew chapter 12
[1:29:47] matthew chapter 12
[1:29:50] if you if you read matthew chapter 12
[1:29:52] jesus
[1:29:56] was rejected in matthew chapter 12.
[1:30:00] praise the lord he was called
[1:30:03] you know abbessible
[1:30:06] amen so
[1:30:10] the scripture says and and then when he
[1:30:12] move on
[1:30:13] and you know
[1:30:19] and this is uh you know uh uh is that
[1:30:22] that the capital song we know his
[1:30:24] brother
[1:30:24] and his sisters and all of that but you
[1:30:26] realize that uh
[1:30:28] jesus is it's almost like
[1:30:32] his ministry was close enough
[1:30:37] god sent them a gift and they gave
[1:30:40] they have they have their you know they
[1:30:42] they have spoken
[1:30:43] evil about the gift
[1:30:46] that he's using some kind of evil spirit
[1:30:51] so the rejection of god's gift
[1:30:55] now god is also going to stop
[1:30:58] speaking to them in a way that jesus
[1:31:02] from that time is only going to speak
[1:31:06] in parables
[1:31:12] and the bible says there in matthew
[1:31:14] chapter 13
[1:31:15] if it was not parable he never spoke to
[1:31:18] the public
[1:31:20] everything he said from that time
[1:31:24] you look at the son of man ministry is
[1:31:27] the same
[1:31:28] praise the lord after
[1:31:32] brother branham minister was was
[1:31:33] rejected by the people
[1:31:35] that was when the seals came what it was
[1:31:38] it was it was mystery it's the same as a
[1:31:42] parable
[1:31:45] verb adam started preaching things and
[1:31:47] people say oh wow he's far
[1:31:49] off what is he talking about
[1:31:55] and with our parable he never spoke to
[1:31:57] the public
[1:32:02] now bring it to the individual just like
[1:32:05] we we are talking to the individual this
[1:32:06] is a
[1:32:07] this is the prayer meeting night you
[1:32:09] know
[1:32:10] when god is is trying to deal with your
[1:32:14] heart and god is trying to
[1:32:16] to open your understanding to the word
[1:32:18] and and
[1:32:19] and you and you just get you get stuck
[1:32:22] in your flesh
[1:32:24] you know and the holy spirit keep
[1:32:27] you know speaking to you warning you
[1:32:31] against something or about something
[1:32:33] and you just guest stop them
[1:32:40] the word now becomes
[1:32:43] a parable to you
[1:32:46] you can sit there and listen to all the
[1:32:48] different things they are saying
[1:32:50] but you don't have answers to hear what
[1:32:53] the spirit
[1:32:54] is saying to the church
[1:32:59] you can sit down and listen to the to
[1:33:01] the preacher message and
[1:33:02] and and you know it's it's not just
[1:33:05] picking up the bible
[1:33:06] and trying to come and preach something
[1:33:09] to the church
[1:33:10] every time
[1:33:13] we kind of wait on the lord
[1:33:20] you watch and see what god is doing
[1:33:24] around the people
[1:33:27] and sometimes they are there sometimes i
[1:33:29] just leave certain things because i just
[1:33:31] think that well
[1:33:32] it's it's not a good time
[1:33:42] trying to see what the spirit
[1:33:45] is saying to the church
[1:33:48] in every age it was the cry the same
[1:33:52] crime
[1:33:53] hear what the spirit says
[1:33:56] if you are a christian you
[1:33:59] will get back to what the spirit is
[1:34:02] teaching
[1:34:05] that is the word of
[1:34:08] this age every messenger
[1:34:12] to every age will preach the word
[1:34:16] every fresh and true revival
[1:34:20] will be because men have gotten back to
[1:34:23] the world
[1:34:24] for their age
[1:34:28] praise the lord
[1:34:33] not being caught up in all of the the
[1:34:36] the
[1:34:36] the fanaticism that is around the
[1:34:38] message but getting back to the world
[1:34:45] praise the lord get him back to the word
[1:34:52] invisible union brother branham says
[1:34:56] he says that you can
[1:35:00] that take this message
[1:35:05] into a pentecostal move
[1:35:11] this is the pure word it will not mix
[1:35:13] with anything
[1:35:18] praise the lord it has what it takes
[1:35:22] to produce itself praise the lord
[1:35:25] praise the lord amen the pure word
[1:35:30] does not need for us to start at jazz
[1:35:34] and and and make the music loud
[1:35:38] make the people to jump up it does not
[1:35:41] need
[1:35:42] it
[1:35:46] it has everything
[1:35:52] in itself to produce itself
[1:36:01] it's now when we say oh this church we
[1:36:04] need a revival
[1:36:05] i mean that's uh we got to do 3dfast
[1:36:08] everybody let's come here let's father
[1:36:10] lay on our face
[1:36:16] return back to the word
[1:36:23] return back to the word
[1:36:30] as we will also learn from the church
[1:36:32] book brother branham says
[1:36:33] the the the he says the the emphasis of
[1:36:38] the
[1:36:38] importance of the word
[1:36:42] or the importance of the word cannot be
[1:36:50] overemphasized
[1:36:52] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:36:56] every word of god
[1:37:02] those simple things that the grace of
[1:37:04] god picks up in
[1:37:06] our lives and he give us grace to
[1:37:10] address them
[1:37:14] our personal
[1:37:17] relationship with the lord and devotion
[1:37:19] with the lord the personal time we spend
[1:37:21] with the lord
[1:37:22] and all of those things is you know it's
[1:37:24] it's it's a way
[1:37:25] word i mean we we are blending in with
[1:37:29] the lord you you
[1:37:30] the thing about it there is that we look
[1:37:33] so
[1:37:34] much at this our body we this flesh and
[1:37:37] we
[1:37:37] we kind of look for some kind of emotion
[1:37:40] or some kind of a physical thing
[1:37:44] but as we walk in the uh just like john
[1:37:47] says
[1:37:48] as we walk in the light as
[1:37:51] he is in the light
[1:37:56] that is our connection to calvary
[1:38:01] he says the blood cleanses us
[1:38:04] when we start learning to address things
[1:38:07] by the word of god

[1:39:04] the importance of hearing what the
[1:39:07] spirit says to the church
[1:39:10] he says every fresh and truth revival
[1:39:13] will be because man has gotten back to
[1:39:18] the world
[1:39:19] of their age
[1:39:24] another word of you know some kind of a
[1:39:26] writer or some kind of for you know
[1:39:29] uh uh tv evangelist
[1:39:32] but the word of the ih
[1:39:38] praise the lord
[1:39:41] i'm not a good reader but i love to read
[1:39:45] i love to read i i love to read i buy
[1:39:48] books
[1:39:49] and sometimes just just uh
[1:39:52] just the top you know just the title of
[1:39:54] the book would grab my attention
[1:39:58] and i was asked to read just
[1:40:01] reading you know see what what is out
[1:40:04] there
[1:40:05] and and pretty soon something will be
[1:40:08] said and i stopped and says
[1:40:13] i think brother branham says something
[1:40:14] about this
[1:40:16] or maybe i've not even heard what
[1:40:18] brother branham said about it
[1:40:19] i will tell you something i was looking
[1:40:23] at a
[1:40:23] at a
[1:40:28] a documentary and when what i was
[1:40:32] actually
[1:40:32] looking for is that i was i was
[1:40:36] uh studying on
[1:40:39] uh part of prisoner so i started looking
[1:40:42] at documentary about praising
[1:40:44] i'm looking for some of the you know
[1:40:46] some of the
[1:40:48] the the big praising around the world
[1:40:52] and i never even knew that brother
[1:40:54] branham talked about accustrike you know
[1:40:56] one of the the big america praising
[1:40:59] you know and then as i was as i was
[1:41:02] looking at different praising
[1:41:04] then i saw that you know that was that
[1:41:07] was one
[1:41:08] you know that some time ago it was uh uh
[1:41:12] you know more than the one there in cuba
[1:41:15] and then i says i said i said
[1:41:18] brother brandon may have said something
[1:41:20] about this because it was in his time
[1:41:23] so i then went back and started session
[1:41:25] through the message and i realized there
[1:41:26] are just bunch of cults where he said
[1:41:29] he talks about it you know and which of
[1:41:32] course i've listened to this message i
[1:41:33] heard him saying it but i did not pick
[1:41:35] it up
[1:41:37] it was not enlightening to me that
[1:41:39] brother brown was talking about a
[1:41:40] maximum praising in the united states
[1:41:44] but then as i was looking at that
[1:41:46] subject
[1:41:47] you know i'm going to saying that to say
[1:41:50] that
[1:41:51] you know that's how the word
[1:41:55] enlighten you
[1:42:00] that's how that's how it you know it
[1:42:02] just it just
[1:42:03] and i realized that i mean there were
[1:42:04] just a lot of things that he said when
[1:42:06] we get to that time we'll talk about it
[1:42:08] praise the lord and i was saying oh my
[1:42:12] goodness
[1:42:17] but every fresh and true revival
[1:42:22] it was because men
[1:42:26] got back to the world
[1:42:30] the pure word for the age
[1:42:37] using the word should these deal with
[1:42:40] our situation
[1:42:46] the cry of every age
[1:42:50] is the rebuke you have left the word
[1:42:55] the word of god repent come back to the
[1:42:57] word
[1:42:59] from the first book in the bible genesis
[1:43:03] told the last book revelation there is
[1:43:05] only one reason
[1:43:08] for god's displeasure
[1:43:11] living the word
[1:43:19] and there is only one remedy
[1:43:23] to regain his favor
[1:43:27] back to the world
[1:43:36] praise the lord
[1:43:41] you know there are a lot of good
[1:43:43] teachers out there that have
[1:43:45] that have good advices
[1:43:51] but bring those things back to the world

[1:44:52] down
[1:44:52] and get himself involved in your
[1:44:54] decision-making
[1:44:59] he he want he want to make a suggestion
[1:45:04] which of course would not be a
[1:45:06] suggestion it would be an instruction
[1:45:09] because whatever he suggests you better

[1:48:15] oh be mine eyes
[1:48:20] lord

[1:51:59] let's just speak to the lord tonight
[1:52:02] each and every one of us
[1:52:06] how much we want to hear the voice of
[1:52:08] god
[1:52:13] how much
[1:52:16] are we making time
[1:52:20] to read our bible or play an audio bible
[1:52:25] are we making time to read the message
[1:52:28] or play as salmon
[1:52:34] that's the reason why sometimes you hear
[1:52:36] people talking about
[1:52:38] that the message says and they just have
[1:52:40] things all mixed up
[1:52:45] because we are just perceiving things by
[1:52:47] ourselves
[1:52:55] there are some people that sit around
[1:52:57] the message and how many years they have
[1:52:59] been five
[1:53:00] ten years and it still does not connect
[1:53:06] it does not connect they just think that
[1:53:09] this is just
[1:53:10] like a pentecostal church or this is
[1:53:12] just
[1:53:13] like another uh you know
[1:53:17] cult where we are just confirming
[1:53:19] ourselves this is not a lot of these
[1:53:21] things
[1:53:22] this is not a like like a jehovah
[1:53:25] witness movement
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:30] this is word just like god
[1:53:34] coming down in the cold of the evening
[1:53:37] and saying adam adam where are you
[1:53:40] god having relationship with his people
[1:53:47] god coming into fellowship wanting to
[1:53:50] commune with you
[1:53:51] and make himself known for you to know
[1:53:53] his nature
[1:53:55] for you to know the thoughts that he
[1:53:58] think towards you
[1:54:17] open my eyes lord
[1:54:24] i want to see jesus
[1:54:38] [Music]
[1:54:42] father teach us lord
[1:54:46] teachers of god teach us lord jesus
[1:54:51] teach us lord
[1:54:54] that we will not lean to our own
[1:54:56] understanding
[1:55:01] some folks you can tell them what the
[1:55:02] word of god says
[1:55:04] you can tell them what the message says
[1:55:06] they will argue
[1:55:08] they will argue they will bring all
[1:55:10] their reasoning why but while they said
[1:55:12] why
[1:55:13] that and and i mean it is just
[1:55:16] a negative that that negative current is
[1:55:19] just in them
[1:55:25] if it is not their ideas or what they
[1:55:27] think about it
[1:55:29] they so struggle with it the struggle
[1:55:32] with truth
[1:55:34] we must embrace truth
[1:55:39] we must embrace truth we must surrender
[1:55:42] to truth
[1:55:43] we need the help of truth
[1:55:49] for the truth has come to set us free
[1:55:54] the truth has come to give us life and
[1:55:56] life abundantly
[1:55:59] yeah there is something there is
[1:56:02] something
[1:56:02] inside that makes people to struggle
[1:56:05] with truth
[1:56:06] no matter how simple you make it to them
[1:56:13] sometimes you talk to people about their
[1:56:15] past and trying to tell them how
[1:56:17] god in his mind
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:26] took a picture of them they struggle
[1:56:28] with it they can never come
[1:56:29] into that room to embrace the thing that
[1:56:32] god has freely give them
[1:56:37] and sometimes people's mind is just so
[1:56:40] fundamental
[1:56:42] well i pray to god god forgive me and
[1:56:44] but yet
[1:56:47] they cannot walk away from that
[1:56:51] so they pray to go back again to pray to
[1:56:53] go back again
[1:56:57] it's just just a fundamental mind
[1:56:59] fundamental understanding
[1:57:11] [Music]
[1:57:51] lord
[1:57:56] help me to
[1:58:16] we want to see
[1:58:26] [Music]

[1:59:55] speak to me
[1:59:58] my lord
[2:00:02] come by here
[2:00:09] oh lord
[2:00:17] somewhere in the book of sons of solomon
[2:00:21] he described a scene where the beloved
[2:00:24] came
[2:00:25] and he was knocking and calling
[2:00:28] and the bride didn't year until he went
[2:00:32] so she had to leave the house and went
[2:00:34] through the street
[2:00:36] and start asking have you seen my
[2:00:38] beloved
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:01:01] saints when god is about to pull his
[2:01:05] his blessing upon the people when he
[2:01:08] about to speak to
[2:01:09] speak to them through spiritual dreams
[2:01:12] and gifts
[2:01:14] it would take a church it would take a
[2:01:16] believer it would take a son and
[2:01:17] daughter of god
[2:01:18] whose spirit is so torn to listening to
[2:01:21] the voice of god
[2:01:37] sometimes people come
[2:01:40] [Music]
[2:01:42] after the service
[2:01:45] they can't even be they can't even trace
[2:01:47] their talk back to
[2:01:49] the message that was preached
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:55] every time a message is preached
[2:01:59] it's not just for the good salmon
[2:02:06] there is something that the spirit is
[2:02:08] saying to the church
[2:02:10] there is something that the spirit is
[2:02:12] saying to the individual
[2:02:19] [Music]
