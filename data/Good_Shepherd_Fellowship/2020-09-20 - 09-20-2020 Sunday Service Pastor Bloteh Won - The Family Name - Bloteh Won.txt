atmosphere in happiness get closer to the lord every day let's let's just take our our bibles we will go right into the word of god this uh this morning and let's go to the book of ephesians ephesians chapter three let's take efficient chapter three uh oh yeah and i knew where i got stuck a new way i got stuck i knew i knew there there was something i wanted to do in and it just slipped my mind in and i've asked you to stand so we would do that maybe at the end of the service this uh this uh song from the la fountains sanka many many uh years back uh have a cassette of faith it says you look more like your father every day so i took i tried to write the chorus of the song that's what i wanted for us to practice but i got stuck and i forgotten and i've already dismissed the musician so let's just read the word of the lord we will see if we can we can make a little singing of that at the end of the service praise the lord maybe maybe the good lord knows that the atmosphere is right and my singing might destroy it so he hold my mind back to forget about it he said son the atmosphere is just right for me so don't come and play into it and i thank the lord for that amen because he's our help ephesians chapter 3 now we've been talking about this revelation of jesus christ and uh is it's kind of for getting getting bigger getting larger because great is the mystery of godliness amen is something that you can just put your mind around you can just take one verse from the bible and and and and be able to justify yourself onto it let's read from verse eight i will i will take from verse eight year because reading from verse one paul goes into a lot of different things about this mystery but from verse 8 he says unto me that's the apostle paul whoa i'm least then the least of all sins i'm less than the least of all sins is this grace giving that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery so you see we are fellowshipping with a mystery we are fellowshipping with a mysterious god that we cannot just keep him in titles we are fellowshipping with a mystical body amen fellowship with the mystery it becomes so sweet amen praise the lord i might just change my subject this morning and preach on fellowship with the mystery amen the mystery wish from the beginning of the world had been hid in god that mystery was hid in god who created all things by jesus christ i thought the scripture said in the beginning god created heaven and earth and yet paul is saying he created all things by jesus christ am i reading something different or that is it how it is in your in your bible the god that had the mystery hidden in him created all things by jesus christ now you gotta remember revelation chapter one now the revelation that god gave unto him jesus created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now onto the principalities and power in heavenly places the lord bless you you may have your seed as we continue to read might be known by the church the men for wisdom of god i according to the internal purpose which he purpose in christ jesus our lord amen in whom we have boldness and asses with confidence by the faith in him wherefore i desire that that if net at my tribulation with you which is your glory verse 14 for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named so what the whole family name what is god's family name that's what paul is saying here by my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth so we're going to talk on the family name this morning the family name praise the lord amen of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he who grants you a calling to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man praise the lord i'm going to talk on family name family name and uh and what i was looking at is i was trying to to look at in in there there's there are amazing signs out there amazing science you see all of these technology there they are building all of these things and now they have they have facial recognition and all of these things with facial recognition and then you you think about it now you have to realize that science has broken into god's laboratory that's what brother branham told us and he says he says one of these days signs might find god quicker than the preacher is if we don't get down and start studying god's word signs will get a hold of god quicker than we will do that's why he said because those people they are breaking and i was just thinking about it now we're having all these uh visual services and visual meetings and and brothers have even been able to have conventions you know they have been able to have conventions around the world you know uh uh brothers preaching uh from from this place and preaching from that place and and even one night but the area have to help me uh about three a.m to preach it over in south africa and i was just thinking about that one of these days in asia yeah i think i think uh i need to look into this i need a new preach on this because what it is is that paul says in the book of hebrew he says we have a cloud of witnesses amen while we are in service this morning and and and the bride and christians around the world are in service there are people that are looking from the brightness of heaven and looking down you know on us we have this cloud of witness you know so so uh uh virtual service has been going on long time before coronavirus praise the lord amen it's it's not a new thinker you know uh uh uh to to the people of god because we know uh uh you know heavenly host in the in things that have gone on before has been looking down on us so i was i was reading this thing uh uh and and some some scientists from from uh from from jerusalem hebrew scientists and and they were looking into the amazing fact of facial recognition you know and uh how that uh there is there is such a science in it how can this think this this material that can you smash on the ground right now you just shut it into but there is social intelligence that is built in it that you know when i put a facial recognition on it comes out it brings a square they try to get my face you know and uh and it and and by that facial recognition it can also be able to detect my name praise the lord they can be able to detect my name and and and and the science is so amazing out there and and it's all because it's from the great god you know when science discover the dna code when they discover the dna code they reveal they went back and changed a lot of their their scientific teachings because the dna court put signs into a corner that is hard for them to for them to deny that there is not an intelligence that put this world together amen all the evolution curating all the theory that they have but when they came to the place where they discovered the dna code they put them to the corner they have to go back instead reviewing and changing some of their teachings and as i was studying last night i was just looking into different things and uh and just one that is common is that we all have met somebody that says oh you look like somebody i know that's right yes sir and have you all also experienced word you hear a certain name and just by the sound of that name you put a face to it you put a face to the name you you even put a structure he's a huge guy you have never met this person you have never seen them it's just by the sound of your name something in you just just create a picture praise the lord what an amazing word that we are living in amen and think about this other fact also a man from another country or another city gets married to a woman and after a couple of years people say you look alike you look alike praise the lord and i was reading the testimony about uh a couple that it actually embarrassed them they had to go and do a dna to find out that they were not related because everywhere they show up people says wow is that your sister no that's my wife oh my goodness y'all look alike the lady said she got she got so scared that she and her husband have to go and and do uh uh some uh some some some dna tests to make sure that down the line they never came from some grandparents by one block god made all men that's right praise the lord amen the next time you see someone that looked just like me it was the sales that just broke out of me you mean praise the lord we don't have to come from the same father or the same mother so we want to talk about the family name and all that drove me into this was how how family name how family resemblance comes together you know how family name brave family resemblance someone know a relative of yours or know maybe your parent or know a sister of yours and and they hear your name and says well are you related to this say yeah y'all look alike it's not actually that they they look at your future but the name just the family name brings in a resemblance praise the lord what i mean the science is uh it's it's kind of fascinating out there uh uh and and and you know and talking about it this way is not driving you into a a science teaching but the fact of the matter there is that all of these things that god like like paul said in romans chapter one the the the the the visible things amen the things that god has made is out there in nature there are a lot of things out there in nature that we don't need a bible to believe that there is god but because man will not believe it now science is making those things tangible right brother that's right they are making it tangible by putting it in a cell phone when jesus says speak the word and whatever you ask the father it will be given to you it's hard for us to believe it but science has make it tangible and you can say siri where is mcdonald's and seriously my dad was right around the corner but that's what jesus said long time ago that's what god has given to you you could step into there by faith so science is making it tangible yes that's all science is doing they are not creators they are just making the creation more visible that's right are we together amen so paul says here about my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is name so we want to talk about the family name this morning and because we have a family name it has given us the family resemblance that's why we want to look at this morning as chapter 4 verse 12. as chapter 4 verse 12. that was where the apostle says neither is the salvation in any other for there is none other name on the heaven giving them one name whereby we may be saved no other name except the name of our lord jesus christ amen and the scripture also make us to know at the mission of the name jesus christ every knee shall bow every tongue we confess so god have exalted that name he has taken it as his family name paul says the family in heaven and the family on earth are we together yeah praise the lord uh exodus and since we we're trying to uh uh run a little bit let's run amen we can run let's run we can run stay yes praise the lord amen that was the way that got us running when we were little we can run let's run we can run stay exodus chapter 23 verse 10 verse 20 god bless his name in an angel now let's let's read that and just build this a little bit here and then we will we will run with that exodus chapter 3 i mean chapter 23 uh behold i sent my angel before thee to keep me in the way and to bring thee into a place which i have prepared be word of him and obey his voice provoke him that for he will now pardon your transgression for my name is in him praise the lord now this is the almighty god elohim god speaking to moses and the children of israel that he had placed his name and we know a name is not just the sound of a word a name is more than the sound of the word the name is a characteristics amen is a characteristic it's the nature of an individual it's not just the sound of a word john peter no it's not just the pronunciation of a word but the name so in this place that that god is speaking here because that angel was the injured of the lord the angel was not called anything different but the injured of the lord but yet god is saying i have put my characteristics in this angel that is going to lead you amen i've put my characteristics in him he's not an ordinary angel praise the lord so he said beware don't provoke him to anger are we together deuteronomy chapter uh uh 12 verse 5 the scripture here will show us that god put his name in a place he put his name in a place no wonder why places a name after people amen liberia our capital was named after james morrow they called it monrovia but out of all of these things a word it shows a a a a little sense of of of god's attribute being manifested here the scripture says in deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 5 but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shaiya sikh and federer thou shalt come now so we we see here god place his name now this this place was the chosen place of worship as it was called or true or through uh the scripture a place that god had choose to put his name and and he says that's the only place he was going to meet man for fellowship praise the lord second chronicles chapter 7 also show us it's another favorite scripture we read it show us that god put his name in the people a people that are called by my name amen if the people that are called by my name will humble themselves praise the lord the people that are called by my name will humble themselves and turn from their evil ways are we together now so we see these things out here how god almighty god putting his name in an anger amen he put his name in a place to meet his people and he put his name among his people he put his name a people that are called by my name a people that are identified by my name are we together now but all through the old covenant or the old testament god never took on a name amen it said in the book of of of uh exeter he says my name jehovah was never made known among them he never he never took on a name but he was called means by different manifestation when he held his hands up he became their defense amen the children of israel saw just by holding moses hands up how god fought their battle and they said the lord god is our defense amen abraham witness right on the mountain when there was when there was when there was no uh uh hurts there was no shepherd there was nobody up that mountain just abraham and isaac and he witnessed god creating a lamb god almighty god creating a lamb and sticking the lamb in the ticket he witnessing it praise the lord amen just at the time he was bringing the the the the sacrificial knife down on his son god had his hands by seeing god creating an alarm and and and and sticking it in the bush abraham says he's jehovah jarrah amen god will provide for himself yes amen hallelujah praise the lord amen god will provide for himself if god is giving you a job he's providing for himself because he's uh he's he's glorifying i mean he's keeping his promise he's the sustainer of life there are people that don't they don't go to church yeah they are 80 years they are angry in their spirit against god but yet they seize god's provision he's provided for them because he's not providing for you he's providing for himself because he's the father of this household called the word and if your father cannot take care of his own that's right and he's undefeated our god is not on the so god provide for himself that's why the believer grabbed the revelation when god provides for him he knows that god has provide for himself so he take the tenth of it and give it back and say lord this is what you provided for yourself that's a pain tire it has to be a revelation it's not a it's not a combining amen like it was in the old testament it's a revelation in the new testament church praise the lord and if god does not give you a victory in thy area you will just be denying yourself from the blessing amen so all of all of these names jehovah jarrah and jehovah you know uh uh uh testing our the lord our righteousness you know dearly jeremiah and all of these was was for from some form of manifestation the way god showed himself and the people of god cried out but there was not an ethnic name this is the beauty about the name of jesus that even before he was born there were many children it just is it's just the same thing as joshua jehovah's savior so that name is god taking on an ethnic name god identifying himself with humanity praise the lord amen god taking on an effluent name why because god materializing himself like we said wednesday night god bringing himself to dust was the desire of the father was to break himself down man that's the reason why they're over in in genesis god said let us make man in our image because man is the highest form of of god's revelation amen the highest form of god's revelation that's why he kept there for the last after he has made everything he says now this is my my greatest expression are we together so we're talking on the family name here praise the lord he promised spoke through isaiah unto us a virgin shall conceive his name would be called emmanuel it was just a manifestation you know it was a manifestation it was a covenant emmanuel means god with us praise the lord but the angel told mary his name will be called jesus for he will save his people from their sin he was not the first one called jesus amen but he came and he took on that earthly name to identify himself with his attributes to identify himself with us he could have come right from the cross the the cradles of heaven being escorted by angels but he came by the way of our birth amen and he took on an effort named but god has made that name like the apostle said amen he says god has made this jesus both lord and christ this jesus that's what we're talking about this morning family name i believe every one of us in here have a family name and all of us are proud of our family name if you are not proud of your family name i would say it's a shame on you praise the lord should be proud of your family name why should you be proud because please god put you in that family it's please god to put a predestinated seat in that family watch over you over four generation praise the lord amen if you if you don't appreciate your natural family name you will not be able to appreciate your spiritual family name that comes by revelation wars are fought for principles i mean people will fight you if you mispronounce their family name i mean they will get so mad with you praise the lord amen i always like it when people tell me oh i thought you were asian because my family name tricked him oh yeah swore i thought you were asian it gave me an opportunity to give them a little bit of my history because they want to know where you got that name from praise the lord but you know like we were talking on the family tree brother branham says i can't break on my family tree you know he says i can break on my on my family train praise the lord he says because i mean i mean gun shooters drunk us he says that's all and none of us can break on our family tree praise the lord none of us can break on our family tree but we we we're talking about the family name here and uh uh it's it's uh it's very interesting as we look at this because uh this family name has has has has brought a resemblance you know just like i said you know uh uh people being called by the scene and says oh yeah i can see you look just like your brother you know it is only because they know that name it's not because they really know you you know that's not the name it's called you identify with that name and appearance just come oh i can see yeah i can see i see why i was just looking at you you were looking because you were just looking praise the lord amen brother says some few things here uh let's let's go ahead so we can be able to catch ourselves yet a little bit i love to talk to uh young people after service he says he says do you realize this is uh uh the prophet elijah do you realize that you are an individual unit of god yourself a man an individual unit of god yourself he says they tell me i look like my father and he was about my size that's my father well if we are christians then we all have some mark of our heavenly father don't you think so our spirit will take on that reverence that he will have in the meeting for he was i mean for he was being glorified praise the lord amen thank you lord so what what what happens in the in in the natural uh uh uh that's what happens in the spiritual you know actually i was thinking about i've been thinking about it maybe the law gave us privilege to look into that i want to speak on from the invincible to the visible the invisible god being expressed visible because what happened is that this was an internal god an invisible god like paul said in the book of collusion the invisible god amen he said christ is the image of the invisible god so this invisible god kept expressing himself kept trying to make himself known kept trying to make himself known through moses through david through the prophet he kept bringing his picture more clearer more clearer more clearer and then when it came to christ the full image appeared but after christ he started going back he started going back he started going back [Music] that's the reason why he poured his spirit in the church and not his person not his physical appearance because he's going back from visible to invisible that's the reason why there's an invisible union going on amen amen amen hallelujah praise the lord while some people can keep victory 1957 listening to this you appreciate it you notice how beautiful it is to go into your bedroom at night i do to my little boy and stand there with little joseph and my wife and we kiss him from one side of the cheek to the other as as as we lead him to bed and i said mom he's speaking to his wife you know he got your eyes something like like yours and she said yeah and he kind of put it in uh in mind of you where his mouth shaped and so far it's the resemblance of the holy warlock the marriage brings a resemblance amen amen is the resemblance of the holy well amen hallelujah are we together so every son of god every daughter of god has a look of the father praise the lord there is a resemblance the the the holy warlock the resemblance of the holy warlord and when god looked upon adam and eve and seeing it was they resembled him for it was made in his image how he kissed him and how his great heart must have failed to realize that he have expressed himself amen yes he has expressed himself now that he made an image that just looked like him but he has expressed himself he has he has he has got a man and a woman that he can live through that will fulfill his desire yes are we together now this is this is the purpose of the church this is the mystery of god this is the thing that god had in his mind god purpose was not to make ten thousand denominations of different names and different beliefs god's purpose was to get a people that he can express himself are we together that he can express himself true so we know there's a resemblance of the holy warlock it brings on a resemblance and and that resemblance is not only expressed in the child that resembles starts to express in the husband and the wife amen when a husband and wife fuss all the time people say they are living just like dog and cat dog and cat does not resemble amen oh because they're fuss all the time the people two people just like dog and cat but when they respect one another amen when they respect one another and that union starts to create a resemblance praise the lord i mean the union starts to create a resemblance and that is the same thing with the church our union with christ is creating a resemblance we know what he loved and what he disliked praise the lord even in a friendship it does it's not only in an embarrassed relationship even in friendship of two friends when we learn to respect one another amen and we learn the like and dislike of one another not one person trying to impose their selfish ambition on the other person trying to enslave the other person but we respect one another pretty soon people will think that you are brothers they will start to see some kind of a resemblance it might not be a facial resemblance but they see a resemblance of understanding a resemblance word you are seeking my interest and i'm seeking your interest it's not a resemblance word i'm i'm tearing your name apart there's no resemblance in that are we together when a man and a woman come honor that coveted by their vow to one another they put themselves on a knee praise the lord amen they put themselves honor in him and if you respect if we respect that that union that covenant because we have to know is god the creator the one that created man in his image male and female he's the one that that set that coveted and we can never be able to uh uh achieve the resemblance just by the woman leaving her father's name and taking the man's the man's father's name you can have the same name people know that y'all are not the same because there's nothing that shows only a name are we together and we can all come under the same name we are christians but there is no resemblance because we are baptist blue metal is green and we want to show that we are the best we are more spiritual than any church on this block that does not resemble the father amen that does not resemble the father you know what resembled him he was called juan berbers because he was sticking friendship with the low-class people he loved the homeless because he knew that this world was not his home amen are we together so there is something about there is something about name there is there is something about about name that is that is so powerful verb benham said this now look at this look at this under the context of this message that he preached spiritual ammunition verbal says our natural birth immediately put us on a spiritual harmony we all were born in this world with spiritual amenities not knowing our truth identification we only identified ourselves to the father and mother that born us to the to the to the to the tribe we were born in to the country that we were born in we were seeking this identification but we never knew of our truth identification there was something missing in our intelligence that there is no way we could have connected ourselves with god so we were all born that's that's what the natural birth put us in until you are born again and filled with the holy ghost you are still influenced that's why we have identity crisis that's how we have to i mean we we we got to measure ourselves with this person and measure ourselves with this other person that that's the struggle that is inside there's a loss of identity that we are looking for are we together he says what if you didn't know your name was what it was you come from a fine family which i hope you did if you come from a fine family of people and what if you forget that that family name and you go out here living disgracefully praise the lord what if you forget your family name and you you when you go out living disgraceful praise the lord i can i can identify to this personally uh very personally i can identify to have it would take me a lot of time to go into the story of that uh but i had to change my name praise the lord i'm not sure if you really know my real name but i was doing the wall i left home and i wanted to leave the country so i was trying i changed my name because uh uh because of of the figure of my father so i know i won't go into all the story but uh uh when when i got saved then you know then all the brothers i have to tell the church the name i told you people were not my name this is my name praise the lord amen so i can identify with this and uh uh if you come from a family of people and what if you forget that family name and just like i said you know you see people that you know that fight for their family name and and i mean it becomes so uh and some family names just make them so arrogant you know because they think uh they are from this family you know and they are from their family praise the lord if you just know that uh that family every every family name comes with with a spiritual amnesia praise the lord he says this is unto you and your name jones or whatever well i don't know see all right see that's a horrible thing to be a horrible condition to get in well that's just where the church has got it's supposed to be the representation of jesus amen revelation chapter 3 that was that was where the laodicea church you know was found when brother brandon preached his message he identified that you know to the laodicea uh uh you know age you know uh where the people uh uh you know naked blind and not even ignoring it they don't they don't even know you know what what is their their spiritual condition you know well that's just where the church has got is supposed to be a representation of jesus christ but if he forgot that because it got injected into a crease and and denomination and and that they have accepted that instead of the word and they are naked blind miserable and don't know it there's no way to tell them no way to tell them it's just like when we say all of these things you are with god in the beginning there is no way you in your a faith does not connect you with that there is no way you can connect yourself with that because there is no remembrance there is no remembrance praise the law there is no remembrance and you see and and that is the same thing on the other side when god deliver a person when a person has experienced total deliverance praise the lord god cuts away the connection he cuts that connection there is no way you can relate to it there is no way he takes the appetite he takes the very nature away praise the lord amen so you see that's the family name and that is the name that is worth standing for you know in the in in the church ages god commanded the church whenever there's two for his name amen whenever the church stood for god's name he commanded the church i will tell you also that name has a power of choice i mean a power of choice is in your name let's go to the book of hebrew yet a little bit let's go to the book of hebrew oh man praise the lord are we together glory be to god glory be to god the scripture speaks about moses here by faith moses amen in hebrew chapter 11 verse 24 the bible says by faith moses when he was come two years refused to be called refused to be called he refused a name he refused a name he refused to be caught praise the lord it was not the day that moses refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter it was something that he's been feeding on his mind from all that his son school teacher jacob taught him his own armor praise the lord taught him that and he'd been feeding his mind with that he made a choice in his mind and that choice affected his attitude it was not the day he killed the the egyptian that he says now i refuse to become pharaoh no no no it was the choice that made him to do that because he has already refused to be an egyptian that's what pushed him out the choice of a neem affected his attitude that's the power of me praise the lord that's the power of name so you realize here that moses refused to be called an egyptian name make him to refuse to be pharaoh's daughter refuse to be the next pharaoh refused egypt as his motherland i mean when he refused that name there were a lot of things that he refused there were a lot of things that he refused he refused his opportunity these people that he was taking on your name were slaves he refused to be a ruler and choose to be slave that's the power of name praise the lord that's the power of name and yes yeah almighty god the creator of the universe taking on a human name and says i will name all my family in heaven all my family on earth will be named jesus the power of name my goodness if we just know the privilege we have to be called christians if we know how proud we should be to be called son and daughter of god hallelujah yes lord how proud we should live to represent the name by which we are called if we know the privilege that we have we will not play down our faith and try to are smart around it you will be ashamed whenever you misrepresent the name of christ whether in public or in private amen because name is very important god stick death in the commandments don't take the name of the lord your god in vain that's how that's how important god deals with me amen don't take the name of the lord your god invent praise the lord amen well thank you for being it looks like you're putting the house on fire this morning it says lord there's a lot of faith energy in this building i can feed it amen exodus 20 verse 10 he says don't take the name of the law that god in vain he makes it a part of his commanding because name was going to be very important to him amen it was going to be very important and what i was while i was standing there there's a lot i kind of look at this because i was thinking about taking the name of the lord in vain and most of the time uh you know it has all been taught you know is is when we we swear using a law's name and it's more than that amen it's more than that when we do that it's more than that let's uh let's uh uh let's look at proverbs chapter 30. solomon make this prayer to god it will help and bring their picture out beautiful for us i have a few minutes here and then i will close proverbs chapter 30 pro solomon prayed this prayer verse seven two things have i acquired of thee deny me them that before i die he talks about remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty non-riches feed me with food convenient for me praise the lord fill me with food convenient for me lisa before and deny thee and say who is the lord praise the lord see all of our musicians all of these guys that has made names for themselves and money even the asset is still making money while they are gone ever pressley and all of these guys you know from a humble beginning all of them learn singing from a church but when money comes into it when wealth comes into it instead of being god's name their name goes on the wrecker that's what solomon is saying don't make me reach don't make me don't i shouldn't get to the place where i would think that i've achieved this by my effort praise the lord keeping to the place where i can trust you every day amen elizabeth and deny thee and say who is the lord i don't believe in god oprah and all of these people all of these all hollywood stars one time the name of god was a treasure to them by god's grace i hope i can make it that was what every one of them said but when money gets in it and it gets in their head they have made a name for themselves they don't want to have anything to do with god praise the lord and he said who is the lord all leaves are be pulled and still whenever we steal we are taking god's name in vain because you are saying god cannot provide you are denying what god did for abraham and stealing goes far as converting something that is not for you instead of rejoicing in what someone else is have you just you just you just mad what is not you report and steal and take the name of my god in vain see how how solomon attached taking god's name in vain see where he attached a toe it's in the character of the believer it's in the character of the son of god or the daughter of god that practical son knew that if he's if he remains in the pig pen he will be taking his father's name in vain because his father was a king how can i bring the name of an elder so lord into a pig pen see i'm sitting here and my father has sevens he shook himself back to his family name and went back home that's redemption that's a story of redemption the son of god you can't you can't sit and sleep in defeat you can sit and sleep in defeat you are breaking god's name to the mud get up [Music] praise the he's at lord i take the name of my guardian van i don't want to be a beggar when he had ten thousand cuddles on the hill give me the strength to work praise the lord i don't want to get rich overnight either and then i would think that i was smart and i got ahead of all of my peers and then it would be my name praise the lord amen you go back you'll see that you find people having little businesses they call it god will provide because they are trusting god god will make your way when they have an investors that step in and take their business to not another level they take god's name from there and report whatever name enterprise it's no longer god we provide [Music] amen it becomes jacob and sound enterprise one time it was god we provide it's not fun i've seen those things praise the lord amen oh my so all of out of god's children has a resemblance there's this there's a there's a way but i'm tied the resemblance here uh he tied to the promise of saint john the work that i do will you do also it is in that way we resemble the father amen it's in that way we resemble the father when we are doing the works of the father when we are living out the love of the father there is that of the father in us and that's the thing you want to bring out that's the thing he want to bring out that's what he's calling us to this life of separation a message of grace you want to bring you want to bring that thing out of us god i can kill open the red sea he's the same god today he's the same god he's your father his mind jesus said it to his disciples when he was going i go on to my father and your father my god and your god he has already paid the price he has already made the connection heaven and earth has embraced he had tore down the curtains it is your god and my god it is your father and my father praise the lord are we together oh what a beautiful what a beautiful what a wonderful god we serve amen are we together question and answer back of the beast let me just review of this and then we pray he says and that's that's that's the great person the the lord jesus he was jehovah god invalid in flesh the bible said whatever you do in word and this amen i had that yes one of my scriptures to read ii timothy 2 19 whatever you do in words and these do it in his name the bible says the whole family in heaven is named jesus and the whole family on earth is named jesus let us pray in his name let's live in his name let's teach in his name let's die in his name let's be buried in his name let's be baptized in his name oh my goodness and then we will resurrect in his name because that's the family name praise the lord that's the name i want to live for amen i live my life for that name glory be to god you find people even when things are wrong they try to stick out because that's their family name amen praise the lord amen when it goes wrong i take sides with this family name and i say it's wrong amen is wrong y'all want to kick me out do a blood transfusion but it's wrong praise the lord that's what brother branham said those men that wrote the bible were inspired of god because they were they were israelite they were jews but they were not ashamed when israel went astray they bring out the sin and publicize it to the people they were not taking sides because they were jews it was their people this is not a people gospel it's not a people church this is the church of the almighty god there's no name no name no me praise the lord man that's what i like to tell the devil i said satan there is no name no name not your name amen no name given among men whereby we can be saved except the name of god himself the name of god almighty god talk on that name to himself praise the lord let me show you this and tell you this jesus right there in the garden of gethsemane he was standing before his greater test praise the lord amen he was right before his greater test he was in the body he could cry and i believe those whips on his back in palace hall he cried if he could cry at the grave of lazar he cried because he was wearing a skin just like yours a mine he could feel praise the lord the tongues going down into his brow he could i mean he could feel the nails in his hands but even before that that was what he prayed he prayed why because the god that was performing the miracle turning the water to wine the god that was raised in lazarus was about to leave that body and that body was going to go like a man that's the reason why sometimes in our west trials we cry it's almost like we want to give up he says father not my will because the will of the flesh was there to just back up and say i can't do this no i can't do this i can't do this but he submitted himself that was what the father was proud of that was the thing that made god to name his family that name because he's talked to him not my will by your will lord i will not fail you this time i will not fail you right here and he stuck to it and god says i'm proud of my son i would take that name praise the lord he could have named the whole family moses but moses failed him he could have named the whole family in heaven joseph but joseph filled him joseph told a lie he so loved david he says i will give you a name he could have named the whole family in heaven and f david but there we feel him but when he came to this man when he came to this man christ he stuck to it he stuck to it and the father was so proud he says i will take this name to myself and i will name my family in heaven oh my goodness glory be to god whenever god gave you a trial he wants he want to associate his name to your name he want to associate his name to your name praise the lord amen even though you say we stay carrying our biological family name but by the baptism of the holy ghost when we go down that water and be baptized in the name of jesus christ when we come out of that water god has associated his name oh that's what the devil hates you when you come out of baptism the battle begins he starts to blast your mind with all of the stupidness because he know you have taken on a name there the battle begins because you have taken on a name he knows the devil knows that more than many of us many of us because we come out of the water we still try to be proud of our family name we don't see what has happened that we have taken on a name are we together oh my goodness me may god help us amen may god help us when god associate his name to your name the devil will fight against it but if you would just stick there and say lord not my will for your will god will take that name from among the name of your friends from among the name of your associate and he will set that name up in a way in a supernatural way in a spiritual way in a spiritual way that is the thing that makes brother branham cry all the time when he thinks about god telling devi i took you from the sheep called he says nobody wanted to associate with random name because charles branham was a drunk he shot a man and he ran away nobody wanted to associate with that name he says but god associated his name with william branham that there is no nation around the world the people that people in that nation has not heard about the name william branham god has associated his name with billy graham better grant was just a follower of an evangelist that was on the field and that evangelist got so troubled in his mind with the holocaust story and all of that and he throw his bible down says how can we be reading about a god of a jews and he allowed them to suffer in the hands of hitler he threw his bible down and young billy graham was so troubled in his mind what he was going to do he called his mama back home but he took a decision to stick with god's name and god associated his name with billy graham and that name is known around the world his father was not a president brother branham dad was not a president he was not a world leader but because he make a choice he make a choice and god comes behind it and associate himself with thy name and god gave us a privilege you will continue musicians you can come but i'll tell you a real man the weight of a true prophet or woman that's born of the spirit of god will set our after hours drinking in the word of god drinking in the word of god i don't know i didn't get there at all yeah but i i showed that video to you one of these days i was keeping that for my young for the young people there is a video that shows the statistics of people that read their bible that make it a habit to read their bible every day i i never i never thought about it i guess i was going to send it back there to jordan that read your bible every day just take the bible and read it these statistics are not given by message believers [Music] these statistics are given by christians how

their family name and and and now they become uh moses branham and peter branham just thinking about taking on brother branham i mean it would give you favor with god that's not eight respecting brother branham message respecting the word of god that's why i gave you favor with god it's not changing your parents name and taking willem branham name god identified himself with that name because william browner make a choice to stay with god's word that's what brought god to that name if my father was a drunkard or my father i would be so glad to know that god has associated himself with the name of a man that nobody knew his name because it please god to bring me through him and now i commit my life to god [Music] he has raising from the dead and he is lord oh everybody [Music] confess
