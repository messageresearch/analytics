[53:40] let me see you
[53:54] I was reminded on Wednesday night let me
[53:57] let me let me take this first and then I
[54:00] will be able to situate myself here
[54:05] I was reminded on Wednesday night
[54:07] uh the the quote I read from perfect
[54:11] and I think we're the scriptures say he
[54:15] bowled our infremities I will remind you
[54:18] I said iniquities
[54:20] and uh
[54:22] but I mean every one of you people know
[54:24] me but now amen
[54:27] praise the Lord you just gotta you gotta
[54:32] you got to go ahead of me and praise the
[54:33] Lord
[54:34] as you'll be here in gibberish
[54:39] amen
[54:40] so uh one of the deacons reminded me of
[54:44] that and and I said I promised him I was
[54:47] going to get back to that
[54:48] it was a quote we read uh
[54:53] Sunday before
[54:55] I mean Wednesday night before the prayer
[54:57] meeting Jesus remember Jesus
[55:00] as we had in the lesson this morning he
[55:03] never used his power for himself he used
[55:06] it for others
[55:07] that's what it was sent for and you
[55:12] think sometimes why would a man that was
[55:16] so full of power like he
[55:19] will have to ever be saved yes sir I
[55:23] read in some books some words
[55:26] where when he raised up the boy the
[55:29] Widow son from then
[55:32] I believe it was the prince of the House
[55:35] of David there he sat on the Rock and he
[55:38] grown with a headache see he bowled our
[55:42] infremities
[55:44] bad means to pick them up
[55:46] and he had all things like we like we
[55:50] have he has sickness he had Temptation
[55:53] he had trouble he had frustration just
[55:58] as we have because he had to be the
[56:01] right kind of a mediator
[56:03] so he had to be partaker a hustler man
[56:08] of the fruit before he will know amen
[56:13] so uh and then
[56:17] this morning
[56:19] uh
[56:21] I will catch myself here very quickly
[56:25] because uh what I want to do
[56:31] speak on or I'm speaking on this morning
[56:33] is an inspiration that came from
[56:38] um
[56:42] the message God provided place
[56:47] of worship
[56:50] praise the Lord
[56:53] now this is uh
[56:57] 65 11 28
[57:03] even though this is one of the messages
[57:05] that is part of the series that we're
[57:07] playing but it is not this particular
[57:09] one but listen to this
[57:11] one day down on Jordan after that
[57:15] Masterpiece have been formed a made year
[57:20] he comes standing down on the wings of a
[57:25] dove and said this is him
[57:28] he was so in tools
[57:31] with this masterpiece until he struck
[57:35] him
[57:36] on cavalry
[57:39] that he did die for the rest of us
[57:44] the rest of us was imperfect
[57:48] that through the sharing of his blood
[57:52] he might bring many masterpieces
[57:57] being a bride yes
[58:00] told his son
[58:03] masterpiece
[58:05] is scattered because
[58:08] the enthusiasm of God
[58:11] to see such a masterpiece
[58:16] now what what blame me to this is that I
[58:19] was I was looking through
[58:21] uh Skies
[58:23] I was looking through skies and and
[58:26] talking about the woman at the wedding
[58:28] and the woman calling adultery and all
[58:31] of these those women we've been talking
[58:33] about uh and Birdman was you know making
[58:37] mention that you have to know the story
[58:39] behind someone for you to understand
[58:41] their struggle and I started looking at
[58:44] scars and then I came across this the
[58:47] Masterpiece is God because the
[58:50] enthusiasm of God to see his Masterpiece
[58:53] so I want to speak this morning on
[58:56] discarded masterpiece
[59:00] discarded masterpiece
[59:03] praise the Lord this was actually
[59:05] supposed to be part of my nose I don't
[59:07] know why it didn't show up
[59:09] but uh
[59:11] we can we can take it from right here
[59:14] amen I want to I want to speak on the
[59:18] scattered Masterpiece I will have to
[59:20] trust the Lord this morning and uh that
[59:24] uh you know the the holy spirit will be
[59:26] our help
[59:28] amen
[59:31] and uh
[59:35] if you have listened to the Masterpiece
[59:38] series or message you will you realize
[59:42] that of uh brother Brennan went to see
[59:46] Michael Angelo Masterpiece that was
[59:50] built I think is somewhere in Florida or
[59:53] so he was there then and uh and his guy
[59:56] took him to see it
[59:58] and then uh
[1:00:00] when he saw it he was he was inspired
[1:00:05] to see that a man
[1:00:07] was able to materialize what he had in
[1:00:10] his mind the imagination The Invasion he
[1:00:14] had in his mind about Moses he was able
[1:00:18] to materialize that
[1:00:20] and in doing that uh
[1:00:24] uh
[1:00:26] yes Lord and in doing that
[1:00:30] that inspiration kind of forgot him he
[1:00:34] got he got struck he got attracted to
[1:00:38] death
[1:00:40] so he was driving one time and and uh
[1:00:44] talking with uh
[1:00:48] his daughter and her friend that was
[1:00:50] driving along with him and then he he
[1:00:52] got caught up in his mind and started
[1:00:54] thinking about that that was what Drew
[1:00:56] him to preach the message on the
[1:00:58] masterpiece
[1:01:04] there's a thought that is interrupting
[1:01:07] my mind I knew I wanted to say something
[1:01:10] and what I wanted to say is that the
[1:01:12] Lord has been so good to us amen that's
[1:01:15] just all I wanted to tell you that the
[1:01:17] Lord has been so good to us he kept
[1:01:20] interrupting my mind I don't know why
[1:01:23] yes it's making me too too stomach
[1:01:28] the Lord has been so good to us amen he
[1:01:31] has
[1:01:32] he has he has
[1:01:36] kept us
[1:01:38] he has blessed us and we want to be
[1:01:40] grateful to their amen this year has
[1:01:43] been has been filled with our plates has
[1:01:46] been filled with marriages I will be
[1:01:48] gone next week Sunday for another
[1:01:50] wedding
[1:01:51] and over in the DC and so I'll be here
[1:01:55] Wednesday night but then we leave uh
[1:01:57] just before Saturday to get there for
[1:02:01] the wedding and even Even in our group
[1:02:04] here the Lord has
[1:02:06] bless us we have brother aerial wedding
[1:02:08] we have sister Bridges wedding and both
[1:02:12] uh sister Naisha and sister Bridget are
[1:02:15] expecting babies so we want to further
[1:02:18] along
[1:02:22] thank you
[1:02:25] foreign
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:34] now I can preach
[1:02:40] praise the Lord
[1:02:42] amen yeah definitely that's a blessing
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:45] that's a blessing unto us a child is
[1:02:48] born that's what the scripture says amen
[1:02:52] now so uh
[1:02:54] I have to recollect myself
[1:02:58] I would take myself from one of the
[1:03:00] natural inspiration to the spiritual
[1:03:02] inspiration but we will trust the Lord
[1:03:04] for that amen
[1:03:06] and uh so when you listen to the message
[1:03:08] Masterpiece I'm trusting the Lord to
[1:03:11] bring this and uh and and that she will
[1:03:15] kind of bless it to us because
[1:03:18] brother Branham said
[1:03:20] uh despite the work of Michelangelo was
[1:03:25] such a tremendous work
[1:03:28] uh highly praise for an extra ordinary
[1:03:32] Vision that he had about Moses but he
[1:03:36] believed that the masterpiece
[1:03:39] of Michelangelo work was the peace that
[1:03:44] that fed off
[1:03:47] when he struck the image and said speak
[1:03:51] yes he was so inspired he's so enthused
[1:03:54] that he had reproduced Moses that he
[1:03:57] wanted for that break to speak
[1:04:00] so when he struck it and says speak and
[1:04:03] so it put a scar in the in the in the
[1:04:06] Neo on the on the Neil's uh on the leg
[1:04:09] of the image
[1:04:10] so my brother Branham said yeah he says
[1:04:13] he believed that that was the
[1:04:16] masterpiece
[1:04:19] the peace that fell off
[1:04:22] praise the Lord
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:25] he says uh it might be different from
[1:04:29] the way you might view it you might you
[1:04:32] might think that the entire work is the
[1:04:35] Masterpiece yes of course it's a
[1:04:37] masterpiece but uh
[1:04:43] for the fact that he was he was so
[1:04:46] inspired that he believed that their
[1:04:49] clay that he put together could speak
[1:04:52] back to him and uh and and you know and
[1:04:56] he had to strike it on the nail he says
[1:04:58] he believed that the Fallen peace was
[1:05:02] the masterpiece
[1:05:03] now so based on that he started to to
[1:05:07] build build the message I'm kind of for
[1:05:10] saying all of this so to to create an
[1:05:13] appetite in you for you to go and play
[1:05:17] now so he's saying this he he started
[1:05:20] going back to talk about how that was
[1:05:24] the same thing that God did when
[1:05:26] almighty God made his first Masterpiece
[1:05:29] in the Garden of Eden
[1:05:31] God wanted to make Man In His Image
[1:05:35] that's what he said I make man you know
[1:05:37] in my image and in my likeness and he
[1:05:40] was able to produce man that's right but
[1:05:42] just like we said man was made out of
[1:05:45] the Dust of the earth you know in his uh
[1:05:48] his toes were stuck in the earth as as a
[1:05:52] root and God breathed into his nostril
[1:05:56] for man to become a living soul and Adam
[1:05:59] was the son of God in the image of God
[1:06:01] and the likeness of God and but then it
[1:06:05] came a time where God struck Adam on the
[1:06:09] side
[1:06:12] and when he struck Adam on the side then
[1:06:15] he brought out a masterpiece
[1:06:21] now we're together
[1:06:24] amen amen hallelujah
[1:06:28] and uh
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:33] so you see where word uh uh the prophet
[1:06:37] goes alone and build that they are
[1:06:40] taught for us to be able to see what
[1:06:42] he's trying to drive to all this truth
[1:06:45] that Adam was the image of God made in
[1:06:51] the image and the likeness of God
[1:06:54] but when God struck Adam
[1:06:57] he took off a little peace
[1:07:00] the rape of Adam and and and in there
[1:07:05] he pulled
[1:07:07] the mystery of redemption that we've
[1:07:10] been talking about
[1:07:12] amen
[1:07:13] now I'm saying all of this to be able to
[1:07:16] connect back to what we've been speaking
[1:07:19] about or through the the this this
[1:07:22] period of time
[1:07:24] so in in the woman now she becomes the
[1:07:28] Masterpiece even though it is true for
[1:07:30] Adam is a masterpiece because uh I mean
[1:07:33] anything he named God said it is okay
[1:07:36] amen he named the the animals and
[1:07:40] everything because he was a direct
[1:07:42] reflection of almighty God
[1:07:45] made in the image of God
[1:07:47] but yet God struck his son
[1:07:52] and then he brought out
[1:07:57] a flesh of his flesh and the bones of
[1:07:59] his born
[1:08:01] praise the Lord and in that woman
[1:08:05] he poured
[1:08:07] a representation or the mystery of his
[1:08:11] Redemption
[1:08:12] and uh and just like we've been saying
[1:08:15] he gave the woman
[1:08:17] three Divine qualities
[1:08:22] call it qualities there's a young sister
[1:08:25] that called me
[1:08:27] during the week one of my
[1:08:30] my uh many daughters
[1:08:35] and she said
[1:08:36] she said she says she said brother one I
[1:08:39] was following your service on Wednesday
[1:08:40] night and and then I was I was really
[1:08:43] blessed because I've struggled with the
[1:08:45] thought you know you read the Bible it
[1:08:48] looks and just like you said it looks
[1:08:50] like you know the the more character of
[1:08:53] man is spoken about than women is and
[1:08:55] it's just like you know everything that
[1:08:57] the women does is so quiet and silent
[1:09:00] and it's just Joseph is David he's uh
[1:09:02] you know all of that and then we go
[1:09:05] talking and uh and then I was talking to
[1:09:08] her
[1:09:10] about uh uh you know how the uh the
[1:09:15] power of the woman is in hervetous
[1:09:18] God designed it like that you know and
[1:09:21] just like I said on Wednesday night
[1:09:22] talking to her and I said you see that's
[1:09:25] the reason why you will never find a man
[1:09:29] to be a kindergarten teacher
[1:09:37] he can be a bus driver
[1:09:40] because he just get few minutes to stay
[1:09:42] with the kids
[1:09:46] praise the Lord I used to be one so I
[1:09:49] know exactly what I'm talking about
[1:09:52] but to be a kindergarten teacher you can
[1:09:55] never find a man he will just forget
[1:09:58] about teaching
[1:10:02] why because it's not in him
[1:10:06] he's not he can change his name to Ani
[1:10:10] or whatever he want to do he's not built
[1:10:13] that way
[1:10:14] he's not designed it's a god-giving
[1:10:17] vacuum
[1:10:20] you can learn it from a book
[1:10:23] yes Lord you can go to school and become
[1:10:27] a teacher but the virtue of taking care
[1:10:30] of children is God giving
[1:10:34] thank you Jesus
[1:10:37] thank you
[1:10:40] that was just a side piece
[1:10:46] the neuter
[1:10:48] praise the Lord so we were talking and
[1:10:52] you know I I said that to her just to
[1:10:55] kind of for to make the picture looks
[1:10:58] clear to her that you know those things
[1:11:00] are not picked along they are god-giving
[1:11:02] and God gave it for a reason
[1:11:06] you know God gave you for a reason and
[1:11:09] and it is it is uh it's uh
[1:11:12] is is it's alive from the devil you know
[1:11:16] just like we read uh invisible Union
[1:11:20] you know uh they they asked there are
[1:11:22] some uh that didn't have the grace to be
[1:11:25] able to keep one virtue and and yet they
[1:11:27] are blessed with the other ones
[1:11:31] you know I mean they turn out to be
[1:11:33] wonderful mother like uh Susanna Wesley
[1:11:36] that had all of those boys and and and
[1:11:39] uh you know and she was able to be a
[1:11:42] mother that stood out in history
[1:11:44] provided us uh uh uh a church-ish
[1:11:49] messenger and one of the one uh
[1:11:52] wonderful producers of hymns you know
[1:11:54] because it's god-giving you know so God
[1:11:58] uh because the mystery of redemption was
[1:12:02] was placed there in the womb and so he
[1:12:05] protected it with these three sacraments
[1:12:07] you you see there's the reason why the
[1:12:09] woman see has to come by a virgin
[1:12:12] he could not come back any other woman
[1:12:15] it has to come by the Virgin praise the
[1:12:18] Lord I mean there is just a whole lot of
[1:12:20] a thing that is tied to death because it
[1:12:22] all has to do with Redemption praise the
[1:12:25] Lord
[1:12:26] amen you see Paul talking there to the
[1:12:30] Corinthian Church came down to these
[1:12:31] gentile people and talking to them
[1:12:34] realizing that uh they were not giving
[1:12:37] the Lord you know uh I mean uh it
[1:12:41] actually takes the word of God to be
[1:12:44] able to protect to keep to to keep these
[1:12:47] virtues amen it will have to people that
[1:12:50] never grew up around the world they know
[1:12:52] they were not taught uh uh I mean uh
[1:12:56] they're they're so Paul came down to
[1:12:58] these people there in Corinthians and
[1:12:59] seeing all of the things that they have
[1:13:01] done and seen all the mixed marriages
[1:13:03] that was among them
[1:13:05] but yeah he taught them that if I
[1:13:08] believe in woman is married to an
[1:13:10] unbelieving man and is happy to stay he
[1:13:13] says well you have to know that your
[1:13:15] faith you know sanctify your husband
[1:13:17] what is that also Redemption
[1:13:23] it's Redemption
[1:13:25] praise the Lord
[1:13:27] he instructed treatment he says uh let
[1:13:30] the women keep silence for they must not
[1:13:32] soap authority over man is that place of
[1:13:35] taking the word but she shall be safe in
[1:13:37] childbearing what is that
[1:13:41] also Redemption that start back to the
[1:13:44] virtue
[1:13:47] because child bearing is motherhood
[1:13:50] now so we we see from the word of God
[1:13:53] you know that these these things they
[1:13:56] are not just an over makeup for brother
[1:13:58] Branham to to uh like people who think
[1:14:01] to make the message hard or to make uh
[1:14:04] uh know these things were the the you
[1:14:08] know the the mystery of God that will
[1:14:10] reveal to us and that's why we we count
[1:14:13] ourselves a privileged people so as he
[1:14:15] goes along to talk uh about this in in
[1:14:21] the in the in masterpiece
[1:14:25] he brings out a place where he tried to
[1:14:29] make us to see that uh
[1:14:33] uh
[1:14:34] we all came out
[1:14:37] from the birth through the fall
[1:14:40] and by that way
[1:14:43] we were mad
[1:14:46] but that way it created
[1:14:49] ascon
[1:14:53] praise the Lord
[1:14:54] we were all born with his car that's
[1:14:57] what brother Branham talks about and
[1:14:59] says there's a place where the devil
[1:15:00] have a right to he says that's the place
[1:15:03] you have to keep under the blood no
[1:15:05] matter where you were born how you were
[1:15:07] born Satan have a right to that place
[1:15:11] and he can hit you there
[1:15:15] no matter how smart you are what school
[1:15:18] you graduate from what degree you have
[1:15:21] the only thing that keeps him away is
[1:15:24] the blood the bleeding word you got to
[1:15:26] keep yourself under the word
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:31] so we we are all born
[1:15:35] on the uh as a scar that spirit
[1:15:42] the most part of us that was affected
[1:15:45] when we were born is our spirit
[1:15:49] praise the Lord amen because I mean
[1:15:54] uh many of you were born very pretty
[1:15:57] very pretty babies
[1:16:00] with no scar on our body
[1:16:04] but our spirit was marked from the from
[1:16:07] from birth
[1:16:10] so I want you to to think about that
[1:16:14] being born in that way
[1:16:18] it was a masterpiece
[1:16:20] mm-hmm
[1:16:24] remember now we're talking about the
[1:16:26] scattered Masterpiece I want to grab you
[1:16:28] somewhere here and stay trying to
[1:16:31] contact your spirit that's what I'm
[1:16:32] doing everything I'm doing
[1:16:35] because uh
[1:16:38] uh
[1:16:40] we were all born with with a flawed
[1:16:44] and that flawed was being born in sin
[1:16:48] shapely in iniquity come to the word
[1:16:50] speaking lies
[1:16:56] that was his car
[1:16:59] that we that we uh that we had and and
[1:17:03] all all our our
[1:17:07] genetics you know our uh down from our
[1:17:11] parents and you know all flow down
[1:17:14] through that
[1:17:15] you know it all flowed down through that

[1:19:32] so what is he saying
[1:19:34] our lord Jesus body
[1:19:38] is sitting as a memorial
[1:19:42] in heaven
[1:19:45] praise the Lord
[1:19:47] that's why he ascended
[1:19:51] when Jesus Resurrected
[1:19:55] he never
[1:19:56] Resurrected
[1:19:58] in a brand new body
[1:20:03] he told Thomas come and put your hands
[1:20:06] in my palm
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:12] he resurrected and uh
[1:20:16] uh
[1:20:20] historians and some scallops
[1:20:23] says the other
[1:20:26] that might have been some of the reason
[1:20:28] why he was not recognized
[1:20:34] because of the way he was treated
[1:20:39] you have to know that the Bible said the
[1:20:42] gushed out his beard
[1:20:44] they didn't shave it they pulled it out
[1:20:53] they beat him
[1:20:56] on his face
[1:21:00] you think about it why why wouldn't they
[1:21:03] recognize this man that he spent almost
[1:21:05] three and a half years with
[1:21:10] they didn't know who he was
[1:21:12] read Isaiah chapter 50. you see some of
[1:21:16] the description that the prophet as I
[1:21:18] have said that our lord Jesus who have
[1:21:20] been who have gone through
[1:21:26] praise the Lord
[1:21:28] Jesus never never resurrected in in uh
[1:21:33] in a new body
[1:21:36] that will create the fact why the
[1:21:38] disciples did not recognize him no
[1:21:42] praise the Lord
[1:21:44] amen now but you you will you will see
[1:21:48] the other when Jesus Resurrected
[1:21:53] he told Mary touch me that
[1:21:57] I'm not a senate up to my father
[1:22:00] okay when he says uh he says he says
[1:22:03] Merit she turned around and recognized
[1:22:05] that it was our Lord she was running to
[1:22:08] he said touch me now but go and tell my
[1:22:11] brother my brothers
[1:22:13] amen so ah we know in that in that in
[1:22:18] their space of time
[1:22:20] Jesus we saw that he manifested both the
[1:22:26] the the terrestrial the the celestra and
[1:22:30] uh and the glorified body
[1:22:34] right in that period of time because he
[1:22:37] was in a Celestial body that's why he
[1:22:39] could not be touched
[1:22:43] but after he had presented the sacrifice
[1:22:46] before God
[1:22:47] and it was accepted he took on a
[1:22:51] glorified body
[1:22:53] and at this time he could be touched
[1:22:56] but he could also go through the wall
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:23:03] praise the Lord
[1:23:04] amen
[1:23:07] now so
[1:23:09] that body
[1:23:12] is a memorial to God
[1:23:17] praise the Lord
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:21] the body of the Lord
[1:23:24] now is the church
[1:23:28] it's not that Sky bowling
[1:23:31] no is the church that's why he said to
[1:23:34] Paul why persecute thou me
[1:23:40] praise the Lord
[1:23:42] amen
[1:23:43] amen we think about the body of the law
[1:23:46] we we try to imagine him we try to keep
[1:23:49] this picture in our mind no this is the
[1:23:51] body of Christ
[1:23:54] yeah thank you Lord this is the body of
[1:23:56] Christ
[1:23:59] that's the reason why you I mean uh you
[1:24:02] I mean you you have to you have to know
[1:24:04] what you said about the church
[1:24:09] this is his body
[1:24:14] this is the body that he speaks up and
[1:24:16] says uh you know I will wish that a
[1:24:18] millstone was hanging around his neck
[1:24:22] and drown in the sea then to bring one
[1:24:24] accusation right yes that's right
[1:24:30] thank you Jesus thank you Lord
[1:24:32] praise the Lord but
[1:24:36] there is a body
[1:24:38] and someday we gather heaven we will see
[1:24:40] it it will always be that way
[1:24:43] and I believe that
[1:24:45] God
[1:24:47] keeps that body as a memorial for a
[1:24:50] reason
[1:24:53] because it's a masterpiece
[1:24:57] praise the Lord
[1:24:59] oh my it's a masterpiece I really need
[1:25:04] the help of God this morning to be able
[1:25:05] to preach and bring out and bring out
[1:25:08] what is on my heart is a masterpiece
[1:25:12] that body
[1:25:14] represent every hurt
[1:25:18] every abuse
[1:25:21] every insult
[1:25:24] because there was no human body that was
[1:25:26] maltreated
[1:25:28] like the way that body was treated
[1:25:33] and that's the reason why God keeps it
[1:25:35] in his own Galaxy as a memorial
[1:25:40] whenever he looks upon it
[1:25:44] he thinks about his Plan of Redemption
[1:25:54] glory be to God
[1:25:57] amen
[1:26:01] praise the Lord
[1:26:03] now so we we see here
[1:26:06] that the
[1:26:09] right from the beginning
[1:26:12] God had this plan of redemption we
[1:26:15] talked about it a prophet taught us
[1:26:18] he sees less stand on the bound instead
[1:26:20] of time and look before the foundation
[1:26:23] of the word
[1:26:24] and see that God in his mind great
[1:26:27] Allied Elohim a self-existing God with
[1:26:31] all of his abilities audio of his
[1:26:34] attributes wanted to make himself known
[1:26:37] praise the Lord
[1:26:38] he had this great great Plan of
[1:26:41] Redemption
[1:26:42] to be able to display his attributes
[1:26:47] make himself known
[1:26:48] praise the Lord
[1:26:50] and here he made his son in in uh placed
[1:26:54] him he says brother Brown says no man
[1:26:56] make you know uh build a beautiful
[1:26:59] artwork like Michelangelo Dawson and and
[1:27:02] put it in his room he had to pull it
[1:27:04] into a guiding you know uh the the
[1:27:07] guardian of Eden was set up because God
[1:27:10] had his Monument
[1:27:12] God had a living Monument yes
[1:27:16] it was all because of Adam and Eve
[1:27:19] the Perfection of the garden was the
[1:27:22] expression of the image that was in the
[1:27:24] garden
[1:27:26] like you go to any park beautiful place
[1:27:28] flowers out it's not about it it's about
[1:27:31] a structure that is placed there and God
[1:27:34] pulled his own structure there the
[1:27:37] reflection of himself a Psalm that is
[1:27:39] made in His image
[1:27:41] but this one it was a living Monument
[1:27:45] praise the Lord
[1:27:47] Hallelujah
[1:27:49] and uh
[1:27:55] and as time went on and everything
[1:27:57] that's that that we know happened there
[1:27:59] Adam was a perfect representation of God
[1:28:03] he speaks and and nature listened to him
[1:28:08] glory be to God
[1:28:12] bam says something also in that message
[1:28:15] Masterpiece he said all the prophets
[1:28:20] High flaws
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:24] I hope uh I hope you message Believers
[1:28:27] are listening to me because this is what
[1:28:30] your Prophet said all the prophets have
[1:28:34] flaws and I don't believe that brother
[1:28:36] Brenham excluded himself
[1:28:42] praise the Lord
[1:28:44] now you will realize this morning if God
[1:28:46] can just help us because he's the
[1:28:48] preacher you will realize this morning
[1:28:51] is uh his train is made perfect in our
[1:28:55] weakness
[1:28:56] that God brought us through the family
[1:28:59] that he designed for us to come through
[1:29:02] he allowed us to go through the things
[1:29:04] that we experience in our life because
[1:29:07] to God is a masterpiece so God is a is
[1:29:12] the best person will he wants you to be
[1:29:14] for him to be able to express himself
[1:29:17] you will never appreciate
[1:29:20] his Plan of Redemption for your life if
[1:29:23] you were not the Way You Are
[1:29:31] praise the Lord
[1:29:34] unless we start thanking God
[1:29:37] that he have brought us through the
[1:29:39] things that we went through unless we
[1:29:42] start thanking God instead of looking at
[1:29:45] it in a very negative and ugly way and
[1:29:48] dwelling with regret in our spirit and
[1:29:51] unless we start being grateful to God
[1:29:54] that he reached down his hands and pull
[1:29:57] us out of the situation you will never
[1:29:59] appreciate God's redempted plan for your
[1:30:03] life
[1:30:04] because to God it was a master design
[1:30:13] Birmingham says all the prophets have
[1:30:16] flaws
[1:30:18] he says all the ones was a portioned
[1:30:21] have his time he says the first thing he
[1:30:24] did he tried Noah he's still speaking on
[1:30:27] the thought of Masterpiece he said he
[1:30:29] tried Noah and Noah fail he got drunk
[1:30:33] Moses that grandmother Masterpiece of
[1:30:37] God he tried him and he fell he
[1:30:40] glorified himself and wasn't permitted
[1:30:43] to go into the promised land then comes
[1:30:45] David
[1:30:46] he was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:30:50] and David was doing good he smiled all
[1:30:54] the Philistines and told them uh the
[1:30:57] altars and and still with the word and
[1:31:00] then finally a pretty woman upset him
[1:31:03] and he broke the Commandment of God
[1:31:06] lost the word committed adultery that's
[1:31:10] right
[1:31:11] praise the Lord
[1:31:13] amen and as always I like to do
[1:31:17] I was thinking about all of that
[1:31:20] and uh
[1:31:24] I knew I came across something before so
[1:31:26] I decided to go and look for it someone
[1:31:29] wrote a a pretty quote and he says
[1:31:31] before you say you are not qualified
[1:31:36] I recently came across this and I wanted
[1:31:38] to share with you Noah got drunk
[1:31:43] Abraham was too old
[1:31:45] as it was a Daydreamer
[1:31:48] Jacob line
[1:31:51] Joseph was abused
[1:31:54] Moses was a murderer and couldn't talk
[1:31:56] Gideon was afraid
[1:31:59] Samson had a long head he was afraid he
[1:32:01] failed to a woman Delilah Rahab was a
[1:32:05] prostitute Jeremiah and Timothy they
[1:32:10] were too young and Jeremiah was a
[1:32:12] crybaby
[1:32:15] David was a murderer and idolatery
[1:32:20] Elijah
[1:32:22] will switch sided
[1:32:25] somewhere but bam said he was depressed
[1:32:29] oh my goodness
[1:32:34] as I appreached without clothes he was a
[1:32:37] naked preacher
[1:32:38] Jordan I was a man I run away from the
[1:32:40] Lord Not only was the Widow
[1:32:43] job went bankrupt
[1:32:47] now you can go on and on and on
[1:32:49] I just wanted to relax you a little bit
[1:32:57] so all of God's prophets had a
[1:33:01] heart of yes
[1:33:05] amen
[1:33:14] Birdman said someone came to him and
[1:33:16] told him and said brother Brandon
[1:33:19] I don't know how he says I don't know
[1:33:21] why you I mean you can you the people
[1:33:24] regard you as a prophet and you just
[1:33:26] every time you preach you just get on
[1:33:28] those people so hard you know instead of
[1:33:32] fishing them spiritual gifts you just
[1:33:34] you just get on them and you know you
[1:33:37] get on the women and you know and all of
[1:33:39] that
[1:33:42] then uh he said he said
[1:33:49] he talks about one
[1:33:51] great composer
[1:33:56] and he says uh
[1:33:58] I believe that
[1:34:00] many of the perm that he wrote
[1:34:04] there were many many nights
[1:34:07] he will stay in his steady
[1:34:09] and he will write
[1:34:14] as the inspiration is coming to him he
[1:34:17] write them down
[1:34:21] then when the inspiration gets better
[1:34:23] you know you stretch it out throwing
[1:34:26] into the Dustbin and then he writes
[1:34:28] another one again
[1:34:29] when the inspiration gets better he's
[1:34:31] trashed it out and then and and he
[1:34:33] throws in the dust and then he gets to
[1:34:35] his pen again and right
[1:34:38] he says you will realize that if you
[1:34:41] look in the waste basket
[1:34:43] you will see pieces of inspiration the
[1:34:46] beautiful perm that you are reading now
[1:34:48] that you enjoy came from pieces of
[1:34:51] inspiration on all those people
[1:34:55] praise the Lord
[1:34:57] you look at it it looks like a waste
[1:35:00] but the beauty you see now came from
[1:35:03] those masterpiece
[1:35:08] praise the Lord amen you see an artwork
[1:35:12] and you appreciate it it is it's the
[1:35:15] final work that you are seeing
[1:35:18] but it came from many lines of strange
[1:35:21] papers and and and and and and with
[1:35:24] basketball
[1:35:26] because the inspiration was unfolding
[1:35:30] little by little
[1:35:33] it was unfolding and that was the same
[1:35:36] way with all the prophets
[1:35:39] a little of Christ was in every one of
[1:35:42] them unfolding
[1:35:44] until the fullness came in the mind
[1:35:47] Christ Jesus
[1:35:50] David heard of a letter of him Joseph
[1:35:52] had a letter of him Jacob had a letter
[1:35:55] of him Abraham had a little of him
[1:36:01] fullness
[1:36:03] of God
[1:36:05] ly
[1:36:08] praise the Lord
[1:36:09] amen
[1:36:12] but you see we will not have appreciate
[1:36:16] their fullness in a way that we
[1:36:19] understand it until we go back to the
[1:36:21] Old Testament and see in types and
[1:36:24] Shadow the things that he did in the
[1:36:27] lives of the prophets
[1:36:33] are we together
[1:36:36] praise the Lord
[1:36:38] so we realize here
[1:36:41] that
[1:36:42] it was God's design brother Branham said
[1:36:45] he says it will be it will be uh uh uh
[1:36:49] uh it would not be uh the right thing to
[1:36:52] God nature
[1:36:54] amen
[1:36:56] for God to make man and then just uh uh
[1:37:02] put in the path to sin he says so what
[1:37:04] God had to do he give man a free moral
[1:37:06] agency
[1:37:09] but almighty God had a plane he had a
[1:37:11] design and he had a blueprint in his
[1:37:13] mind
[1:37:15] and his desire was
[1:37:18] to make his Plan of Redemption manifest
[1:37:22] displayed his attributes show himself as
[1:37:25] a Healer as a savior
[1:37:27] glory be to God
[1:37:29] now you see he's uh uh talking about
[1:37:32] this and and and all through the week he
[1:37:35] had just laboring under this thought and
[1:37:37] and and then what what was what I was
[1:37:39] actually laboring on there is the
[1:37:42] thought of how
[1:37:45] you know uh sometimes people we become
[1:37:50] so shameful
[1:37:52] of things that we go through
[1:37:55] and then sometimes because of that it's
[1:37:58] almost like uh uh
[1:38:04] we try to uh
[1:38:08] behave as if it did not exist
[1:38:13] amen
[1:38:15] and sometimes uh uh uh I mean it's it's
[1:38:19] almost like you you will see it in a
[1:38:22] place where uh I've you know I've talked
[1:38:25] to someone uh uh some time ago that was
[1:38:29] there was one young lady that used to
[1:38:31] come to church here she'll come once in
[1:38:33] a while and and she wanted to see me and
[1:38:35] uh uh so uh I made an appointment to to
[1:38:39] meet her yet at the church and and in
[1:38:41] the back part of my mind I was thinking
[1:38:43] okay you know when a young woman like
[1:38:46] this trying to see you maybe she's
[1:38:47] trying to tell you that I want to get
[1:38:49] married
[1:38:50] you know I'm just thinking about that in
[1:38:52] my mind I said well maybe she's planning
[1:38:54] a wedding and she want to say well I
[1:38:55] want to bring I want to bring uh you
[1:38:57] know my my boyfriend or something like
[1:38:59] that you know she used to come once in a
[1:39:01] while so we met in and uh as we're
[1:39:05] talking somewhere right there in the
[1:39:07] foyer and and I could just see the
[1:39:09] struggle I mean she was she was just
[1:39:12] struggling and actually what it was it
[1:39:14] was an abused situation
[1:39:16] that she went through as a little child
[1:39:20] and she tried to she tried to keep it
[1:39:22] back keep it from her mind you know and
[1:39:25] and and and and just to see the struggle
[1:39:27] that she had so uh uh I think she was
[1:39:31] talking to a friend and and the person
[1:39:33] says well I think you need to go and
[1:39:34] talk to your pastor about it well
[1:39:37] because she considered me as a as a
[1:39:39] pastor for at that time she decided to
[1:39:41] come in and talk to me about it and and
[1:39:44] the thing also about it that is that the
[1:39:47] uh uh you know uh it was it was a kind
[1:39:50] of a family issue but also the the the
[1:39:54] the family member has has been dead and
[1:39:57] gone
[1:40:00] but you just see the the the Scott and
[1:40:04] and the and the hurt and and and uh so
[1:40:08] in my mind I'm sitting there and as I'm
[1:40:10] talking to her I'm I'm saying to myself
[1:40:12] uh oh my God I'm trying to find a place
[1:40:16] to be able to to to help this lady and
[1:40:20] we talk about it in in a while and as
[1:40:22] you talk about it she broke down she
[1:40:24] started crying and and and and all of
[1:40:27] that and and just just talking about how
[1:40:29] this now one of the things there is
[1:40:31] there the uh uh I mean she never did
[1:40:35] anything wrong
[1:40:37] sure she was the victim in this
[1:40:40] situation
[1:40:41] praise the Lord
[1:40:43] but you see that the thing there is the
[1:40:46] other uh uh protecting
[1:40:50] protecting that that that uh that that
[1:40:52] evil or protecting you know what have
[1:40:55] happened and then and keeping it as
[1:40:58] something as as a treasure you know uh
[1:41:01] that she don't want to think about it
[1:41:03] and and she don't want to talk about it
[1:41:05] and she don't want to let anybody know
[1:41:06] about it
[1:41:08] has been a scary room for her
[1:41:12] has been an area in her life
[1:41:16] because what those things will do is
[1:41:19] that it destroyed Trust
[1:41:21] right
[1:41:23] amen that's what abuse would do abuse
[1:41:26] would destroy Trust
[1:41:29] When people's experience abuses it
[1:41:32] destroyed trust and then what will
[1:41:34] happen also there is that the the spirit
[1:41:37] of the person gets so scarred by this
[1:41:41] thing
[1:41:44] that and whenever they get into an
[1:41:46] environment that ever create the same
[1:41:48] picture they become so terrifying
[1:41:53] praise the Lord
[1:41:55] are we together
[1:42:00] now so I'm I'm on this starting now you
[1:42:03] know I'm kind of for uh
[1:42:06] thinking about it and and uh you know
[1:42:09] and
[1:42:10] and as we as we were just going through
[1:42:12] all of the different uh women that we
[1:42:15] dealed with uh in the past weeks
[1:42:18] uh and thinking about their story then
[1:42:21] thinking about the struggle that they
[1:42:22] have we talk about the woman at the word
[1:42:24] uh last Sunday but just to see the the
[1:42:29] the Liberty the Deliverance you know
[1:42:31] when she met the Lord Jesus and Jesus
[1:42:35] went down to horse cars
[1:42:39] he went down told the abuse and the
[1:42:43] disappointment that she had in her life
[1:42:46] praise the Lord
[1:42:48] amen he went down there and and and and
[1:42:51] and identified and said look this this
[1:42:55] is where your problem is
[1:42:58] amen
[1:43:00] you you are a pretty girl you are a nice
[1:43:03] lady you are I mean uh uh that's that's
[1:43:05] that's that's a representation I mean
[1:43:07] she you you can just see that down in
[1:43:10] her soul was truth
[1:43:15] amen she was trying to be she was trying
[1:43:18] to be truthful there is nothing between
[1:43:21] the the Gentiles and I mean the Jews and
[1:43:24] the Samaritan
[1:43:25] when Jesus said I have it in water I
[1:43:27] would give you she said are you better
[1:43:29] than our father Jacob
[1:43:31] she was trying to you can see truth
[1:43:34] represented in her soul
[1:43:37] deep down in her soul there was truth
[1:43:40] but all of these things that have
[1:43:42] happened to her and in her life have
[1:43:44] have just so scattered her it has
[1:43:47] clouded that truth
[1:43:51] praise the Lord
[1:43:54] and over and over and over and over and
[1:43:57] over and over
[1:43:59] brother Brandon will say is that Jesus
[1:44:01] was contacting her spirit
[1:44:04] and he identified the same thing under
[1:44:07] the son of man Ministry
[1:44:12] he says I'm just contacting your spirit
[1:44:15] and that is the thing that we have to
[1:44:17] realize people
[1:44:19] this message has come to bring healing
[1:44:22] to our spirit
[1:44:24] it has come to heal us
[1:44:27] from the scars that has been created by
[1:44:30] churches and and family and some of the
[1:44:33] scars that run down our bloodstream that
[1:44:35] we didn't even knew about
[1:44:37] but because almighty God knows that you
[1:44:41] are a predestinated son of God or a
[1:44:44] predestinated daughter of God he sent a
[1:44:47] word
[1:44:48] to be able to Quicken that predestinated
[1:44:51] sea and if you can see Christ not seeing
[1:44:54] a pastor not saying that but if you can
[1:44:57] see Christ just like the woman otherwise
[1:45:00] saw Christ
[1:45:02] she saw the Messiah for her day their
[1:45:06] Messiah is the anointed word of the hour
[1:45:12] praise the Lord
[1:45:17] because you have to realize
[1:45:19] Jesus said if I be lifted up
[1:45:22] I will draw all men
[1:45:26] I will pull oh man
[1:45:28] amen
[1:45:29] I would draw all men
[1:45:32] unto me
[1:45:37] once again the bride is going to be core
[1:45:39] equal
[1:45:42] praise the Lord because when God made
[1:45:45] them in the beginning they were called
[1:45:47] equal that's right
[1:45:49] that's right sin create domination
[1:45:52] I say create denomination
[1:45:57] praise the Lord
[1:45:59] a sin that creates domination
[1:46:03] but when he placed them in in Eden
[1:46:07] as his Masterpiece they were called
[1:46:09] equal
[1:46:12] that's why Parkin says that we will be
[1:46:14] joined here with Christ
[1:46:18] Lord
[1:46:21] amen
[1:46:24] so you see that word has come to lift us
[1:46:27] up
[1:46:30] praise the Lord that's why the prophet
[1:46:32] will come and says you never did it in
[1:46:34] the first place
[1:46:35] well he's going back to your original
[1:46:37] identification
[1:46:44] not trying to justify your flesh but he
[1:46:47] wants you to see yourself as almighty
[1:46:49] God sees you
[1:46:51] means yes
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:57] are we together
[1:47:01] so all the prophets All Through the Ages
[1:47:04] High flaws
[1:47:09] even Joseph that came so close to be a
[1:47:12] perfect type of Christ
[1:47:16] he told a lie
[1:47:20] it was a design
[1:47:23] because if he never told a lie he would
[1:47:26] not be a type he will be Christ
[1:47:29] so the thing with times is that times
[1:47:31] breaks
[1:47:35] amen
[1:47:37] that's the reason why Barb said you have
[1:47:40] to wash your picture you cannot put a
[1:47:42] house over a a car over a house eating
[1:47:45] grass
[1:47:46] when people when sometimes people want
[1:47:48] to come out with all of these terrible
[1:47:49] types in the Bible
[1:47:51] you can do that because there are places
[1:47:53] where types breaks and there are places
[1:47:56] where the holes they connect
[1:48:01] there's a place there's a place in the
[1:48:03] life
[1:48:04] of a man
[1:48:06] take for Solomon Solomon in his life he
[1:48:10] had the mystery
[1:48:12] to represent Christ with a many member
[1:48:16] bride
[1:48:19] he how wives from every part of the word
[1:48:26] that was what he represents that's where
[1:48:28] the type holds
[1:48:30] but his wife led him away from God
[1:48:33] that's not a type of Christ
[1:48:38] so you see in in a sense of time it does
[1:48:41] it will not be every aspect of the
[1:48:43] person life
[1:48:45] there is no way you can make Solomon
[1:48:47] wise turning him to worship Idol you
[1:48:49] cannot bring Christ out of that
[1:48:56] are we together
[1:48:58] now so
[1:49:00] all of these things
[1:49:03] that we go through
[1:49:06] and many times
[1:49:10] we have been safe
[1:49:12] been born again
[1:49:15] we love the Lord
[1:49:17] even we have the Holy Ghost
[1:49:20] God has blessed us
[1:49:23] the joy of the Lord is our strength
[1:49:26] praise the Lord
[1:49:28] but sometimes
[1:49:30] what I realized
[1:49:33] that have happened to many people
[1:49:36] they are scarce in our lives
[1:49:39] that we have really not addressed with
[1:49:41] the word
[1:49:46] we have not been able to look at that in
[1:49:48] the light of the word
[1:49:53] it's just just like an evil treasure box
[1:49:58] we don't want to touch it we don't want
[1:49:59] to do nothing with hate
[1:50:02] but as long as you have that
[1:50:06] as long as you have that
[1:50:09] you might not be thinking about it
[1:50:12] you might not be Desiring it
[1:50:15] there will just be something either a
[1:50:17] flash of a color
[1:50:19] or a word that would be said
[1:50:24] praise the Lord
[1:50:28] it's just going to bust The Box open to
[1:50:31] your mind
[1:50:32] and your whole spirit is now in trouble
[1:50:37] praise the Lord
[1:50:38] and pretty soon everybody around you is
[1:50:41] affected they don't know what is going
[1:50:42] on
[1:50:46] but that evil attitude or thy evil
[1:50:49] energy let me call it an evil energy
[1:50:51] it's not affecting everybody
[1:50:54] you are now reacting
[1:50:57] because of something that have passed
[1:51:04] praise the Lord
[1:51:07] do you see why God is keeping a
[1:51:11] scattered body
[1:51:12] as a memorial
[1:51:16] you see why he's keeping a scattered
[1:51:18] body
[1:51:20] because he has already paid the price
[1:51:24] he has given the ransom
[1:51:28] praise the Lord
[1:51:30] he has given the Ramson
[1:51:32] today with
[1:51:36] I was standing last night I mean yeah
[1:51:39] yesterday
[1:51:41] Jesus died to take away our skies as
[1:51:44] well
[1:51:46] that's why we are giving white rocks
[1:51:50] the Bible says the white Rob represents
[1:51:54] the righteousness of the sins
[1:51:58] praise the Lord but you know also what
[1:52:00] it represents
[1:52:04] it represents
[1:52:07] our own scattered body
[1:52:12] praise the Lord
[1:52:14] amen
[1:52:15] when we come up in the resurrection I
[1:52:18] believe we are not going to come up with
[1:52:20] any sky on our body
[1:52:24] there will be only one scared of Body In
[1:52:26] Heaven
[1:52:27] it would be his body
[1:52:31] because whatever was the scar that had
[1:52:34] ever taken place whether it was physical
[1:52:36] or it was emotional spiritual whatever
[1:52:39] it is it was all represented in that
[1:52:42] body
[1:52:52] the Bible said hey please God
[1:52:58] that he will suffer
[1:53:02] yes
[1:53:07] yes praise the Lord
[1:53:15] some people make their scars their
[1:53:17] weakness
[1:53:19] they blame everything to their scar
[1:53:22] right
[1:53:23] they don't they don't they don't have no
[1:53:25] strength to try again
[1:53:28] they don't have no strength there is no
[1:53:30] strength there is no effort to do
[1:53:31] anything because this thing happened to
[1:53:34] me
[1:53:36] praise the Lord
[1:53:42] you have not had a revelation
[1:53:46] of God's Redemption
[1:53:49] you are just trying to make yourself a
[1:53:51] pitiful creature
[1:53:56] praise the Lord
[1:53:59] you are just trying to make yourself a
[1:54:01] pitiful creature you want to be just a
[1:54:03] creature of pity
[1:54:10] just to bring everybody
[1:54:12] to feel sorry for you all this thing
[1:54:15] happens to me
[1:54:17] we are not serving a dead Christ we are
[1:54:20] serving a one that was dead and
[1:54:23] resurrected and he's alive today
[1:54:28] so you don't have no reason
[1:54:31] yes
[1:54:32] to stay the Way You Are
[1:54:36] praise the Lord because there is no sin
[1:54:38] that he cannot forgive there is no sin
[1:54:42] there is no possession that he can
[1:54:44] deliver you from
[1:54:47] [Music]
[1:54:54] oh praise the Lord
[1:54:57] Hallelujah
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:01] as much as
[1:55:02] these physical things are horrible to
[1:55:05] think about you think about it think
[1:55:07] about that woman of the world think
[1:55:10] about the letter caught in adultery
[1:55:12] lifting her eyes to Jesus
[1:55:16] and he said warmer where are thy accuser
[1:55:24] you should look around
[1:55:25] they are all gone Lord
[1:55:28] he said neither do I condemn thee
[1:55:31] go
[1:55:38] praise the Lord
[1:55:41] and a woman of the word Jesus saying to
[1:55:44] her you have six husbands and even a one
[1:55:47] that you just slept with last night
[1:55:51] it's not your husband
[1:55:54] you don't even trust him
[1:55:59] praise the Lord
[1:56:02] and just by going to that
[1:56:05] secret place of her life
[1:56:08] glory to that most sensitive sensitive
[1:56:11] place of her life
[1:56:13] Jesus going there brought such a healing
[1:56:17] and Liberty to that woman
[1:56:21] that you draw me into the street come
[1:56:24] and see him see them that have told me
[1:56:25] all that I have done
[1:56:30] people being curious It's not today that
[1:56:33] people started being curious man has
[1:56:35] always been there what have he told you
[1:56:42] that's right she said come and see the
[1:56:44] man I've told me all the things that
[1:56:45] I've done
[1:56:46] can you tell me what have he told you
[1:56:51] praise the Lord
[1:56:53] and I believe because
[1:56:55] God has visited her wounded spirit
[1:56:59] like Solomon said and won the spirit who
[1:57:02] can heal
[1:57:03] what I'm telling you there's a man here
[1:57:05] this morning the Lord Jesus Christ a man
[1:57:08] that have died and he can heal wound the
[1:57:11] spirit
[1:57:13] he healed the wounded Spirit of that
[1:57:16] woman
[1:57:17] she was not ashamed
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:27] praise the Lord amen
[1:57:30] amen
[1:57:33] do you know sometimes
[1:57:35] a Holy Ghost Field believer
[1:57:39] holy something from the past
[1:57:41] can bring sickness on their body yeah do
[1:57:44] you know that
[1:57:50] you were not the aggressor you were the
[1:57:52] victim but just because you will not
[1:57:55] take it to Calvary
[1:57:58] just because you will not take it to
[1:58:01] Calvary you will
[1:58:03] offer the wrong
[1:58:05] room some kind of for sorrow
[1:58:09] some kind of a siren and take your mind
[1:58:12] back to all of the evil
[1:58:14] and every time you do that you are
[1:58:16] inviting demons for your life
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:23] that's why Jesus said when you stand
[1:58:25] praying
[1:58:27] forgive
[1:58:30] and the prophet of God said that's the
[1:58:32] foundation of faith
[1:58:35] yes Lord
[1:58:37] yes
[1:58:53] praise the Lord
[1:58:55] Hallelujah
[1:59:01] that's why I fell on my heart and I
[1:59:03] thought that okay we we can approach the
[1:59:05] communities tonight just just having a
[1:59:07] prayer meeting pouring our hearts before
[1:59:10] God and seeking his Mercy in them just
[1:59:12] saying Lord you know I don't want no
[1:59:14] dark chamber in my life you know I I
[1:59:17] mean go through all the doors of my life
[1:59:19] I don't I don't want I don't want
[1:59:20] anything of the past I want to be able
[1:59:23] to trust it to the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:59:25] amen Hallelujah
[1:59:35] praise the Lord
[1:59:37] that body says us a memorial
[1:59:44] the Throne of God
[1:59:46] it sits as a memorial
[1:59:53] you think about it
[1:59:55] he raised
[1:59:57] they deal back to life he healed the
[2:00:00] sake
[2:00:02] he overcame death
[2:00:09] what took the scars from his body
[2:00:10] [Music]
[2:00:13] yep
[2:00:16] praise the Lord
[2:00:22] he bowled all of those cars
[2:00:25] to represent
[2:00:27] everything
[2:00:31] that we go through the Bible say he was
[2:00:33] rejected
[2:00:36] even from the womb
[2:00:38] the priest will have nothing to do with
[2:00:40] him
[2:00:43] because he was called an illegitimate
[2:00:45] child
[2:00:46] he was rejected and despised
[2:00:50] that is something that must never be
[2:00:52] done to any child
[2:00:57] praise the Lord
[2:00:59] with all the evil things that was said
[2:01:02] that child was in the war
[2:01:08] he represent
[2:01:09] ing all the things that were said when
[2:01:11] you were either one
[2:01:13] all the things that we're playing
[2:01:16] all the things that were taught off
[2:01:24] glory be to God Amen
[2:01:32] and growing up as a young man as a
[2:01:34] teenager
[2:01:36] nobody want their children to to be
[2:01:38] identified with him
[2:01:43] because they all said he was a bastard
[2:01:45] child
[2:01:54] but he brought that
[2:01:56] to represent whatever sense of rejection
[2:02:00] that we went through when we were
[2:02:02] children
[2:02:03] what a living with our parents what are
[2:02:06] living with strangers whatever he bowled
[2:02:09] there
[2:02:10] right
[2:02:13] right from the womb
[2:02:15] to the Grave
[2:02:18] no s
[2:02:21] praise the Lord
[2:02:22] many of the Saints did not had a grave
[2:02:24] to be buried in Jesus never even had one
[2:02:29] he had to borrow the grave
[2:02:32] praise the Lord I had I heard somebody
[2:02:35] said he says uh when when Joseph went to
[2:02:39] ask for the body of Jesus
[2:02:41] it says uh uh
[2:02:44] you know at this time you ask him where
[2:02:47] are you going to bury him he says I'll
[2:02:48] put him in my tomb
[2:02:50] is wow such an expensive place
[2:02:55] in Joseph mine he knew that Jesus said
[2:02:58] in three days he said don't worry just a
[2:03:00] weekend just for the weekend
[2:03:03] I'm learning it just for the weekend
[2:03:08] praise the Lord
[2:03:10] [Music]
[2:03:11] it was just for the weekend
[2:03:14] man
[2:03:19] well you see what I'm saying this
[2:03:21] morning people
[2:03:22] amen
[2:03:23] we can never walk in this labor time
[2:03:26] where Christ has given us
[2:03:33] most of the things are where we think
[2:03:35] the attack you know our uh uh you know
[2:03:38] we've been careful yeah it's true we are
[2:03:41] living in such a world you have to be
[2:03:43] careful
[2:03:43] praise the Lord you have to stay with
[2:03:46] the word you have to be prayerful
[2:03:48] it helped you the most
[2:03:54] but you see many times it comes it comes
[2:03:57] back from a dark past
[2:04:00] that we struggle with
[2:04:04] praise the Lord now I'm not just saying
[2:04:07] you know just just Overlook those things
[2:04:09] and put yourself in the same vulnerable
[2:04:11] situation no that's not what I'm saying
[2:04:16] what I'm saying is that instead of being
[2:04:19] afraid
[2:04:20] of faith you have to face it
[2:04:24] and you have to take it to the one that
[2:04:27] can resolve it
[2:04:31] because what you want you want healing
[2:04:35] you want healing in your spirit
[2:04:40] because if not because of that fear
[2:04:45] you might either do the same thing or do
[2:04:47] worse
[2:04:50] to the people around you
[2:04:54] praise the Lord
[2:04:55] most of the time when we react
[2:04:58] and and sometimes when you cannot
[2:05:00] associate the reaction of somebody with
[2:05:03] a situation is because they are reacting
[2:05:06] from the past
[2:05:11] you just look
[2:05:12] I think you you just show yourself
[2:05:20] what did I just say that just snap the
[2:05:22] person off
[2:05:25] praise the Lord
[2:05:28] sometimes they are not reacting from
[2:05:30] what happened
[2:05:32] they are reacting something sink in
[2:05:34] their mind and they become defensive
[2:05:49] praise the Lord
[2:05:51] but you see that's the beautiful thing
[2:05:56] that's the beautiful thing that is the
[2:05:58] beauty of the god that we serve
[2:06:03] for the fact that
[2:06:06] that's what he picks up
[2:06:09] amen
[2:06:11] he called it a masterpiece
[2:06:17] he picks that up
[2:06:19] because
[2:06:24] I've always thought
[2:06:26] about
[2:06:28] the thought of a man of sorrow
[2:06:32] praise the Lord
[2:06:35] that God
[2:06:37] is not a god of evil
[2:06:43] yet in outside he says I create evil
[2:06:46] then I create good
[2:06:48] but he's not a god of evil
[2:06:51] and I've always used to think in my mind
[2:06:55] but then why did God create a sorrow
[2:06:59] why would Solomon says that it's better
[2:07:02] to go to the house of morning
[2:07:04] than to go to the house of feasting
[2:07:08] you know because there is something that
[2:07:11] is designed that is placed in our human
[2:07:13] Spirit people
[2:07:15] that every time you you just you will
[2:07:17] just realize it I mean if you if you
[2:07:19] ever get down I mean spend some time
[2:07:21] with the Lord and and and you just you
[2:07:24] are just you are just being grateful you
[2:07:25] are just being thankful to the Lord and
[2:07:28] pretty soon you start to appreciate him
[2:07:30] for your life you just break into China
[2:07:32] and then pretty soon you just start
[2:07:34] crying
[2:07:36] you are not crying because you you feel
[2:07:39] like a horrible sinner but you you have
[2:07:41] moved into a Channel of Sorrow
[2:07:45] sorrow is a China that God has built
[2:07:48] where he can weave around everything in
[2:07:51] our life to give to get a connection or
[2:07:54] get our uh connect with us
[2:07:58] to be able to grab our attention
[2:08:02] praise the Lord
[2:08:12] and he will Design This
[2:08:17] knowing that we are his sons and his
[2:08:19] daughters
[2:08:20] predestinated children
[2:08:23] of God
[2:08:26] for yet almighty God
[2:08:30] will sit there and allow our parents to
[2:08:32] make terrible mistakes we come through
[2:08:34] that or allow us to make mistakes in all
[2:08:37] of that and he sits there
[2:08:42] just to be able to reach out to us
[2:08:44] somewhere down the line
[2:08:47] praise the Lord
[2:08:51] you just think about the Apostle Paul a
[2:08:55] young
[2:08:56] Jewish Board of the Trap of Benjamin
[2:08:58] love the Lord and Lord the word of God
[2:09:03] he came from a very good home his his
[2:09:05] there was a Jew that took on a Roman
[2:09:08] citizenship
[2:09:11] went to one of the best schools
[2:09:16] well Paul realized that his zeal
[2:09:21] all the the the uh enthusiasm that he
[2:09:25] have for the Jewish law the only thing
[2:09:27] that could produce was the death of
[2:09:30] Stephen
[2:09:34] praise the Lord
[2:09:36] Paul realizing that the only thing that
[2:09:38] the laws
[2:09:40] who produced for him was the death of
[2:09:42] Stephen
[2:09:43] and with that
[2:09:46] with that
[2:09:48] he
[2:09:50] put himself to the place
[2:09:54] but Brandon said he says
[2:09:56] I took a life of this gospel
[2:09:59] I would give mine for it
[2:10:04] praise the Lord
[2:10:11] now why why would God
[2:10:14] couldn't deal with him in a dream
[2:10:17] like the way he dealt with Joseph in a
[2:10:19] dream
[2:10:21] praise the Lord
[2:10:22] but you look at poor life you look at
[2:10:25] the intelligence that he had
[2:10:27] a dream who have not been enough
[2:10:30] to convince him
[2:10:34] amen he knows how you are built
[2:10:38] amen
[2:10:39] he knows where all the the your genetics
[2:10:43] all the connection of your blood cells
[2:10:45] and all of the things that is running
[2:10:47] down he knows he knows that little
[2:10:49] strain of stubbornness that is right
[2:10:51] down there
[2:10:55] sometimes you will have to allow these
[2:10:58] things
[2:10:59] because you have to remember a chain is
[2:11:02] only strong
[2:11:04] at its weaker link
[2:11:08] praise the Lord
[2:11:17] you love the Lord this morning
[2:11:20] praise the Lord
[2:11:27] for he has a memorial God has been able
[2:11:30] to achieve to have a memorial
[2:11:34] some of his children were fair to the
[2:11:37] Lions
[2:11:38] some were sore asunder
[2:11:41] some were burned to the stake
[2:11:44] and with everything that went through
[2:11:50] he took
[2:11:51] the innocent
[2:11:53] life birth and death of Jesus Christ
[2:11:58] to represent every every pain every
[2:12:02] suffering
[2:12:04] everything everything
[2:12:09] that God
[2:12:16] do you know what it is taking those
[2:12:19] weight on his bad body
[2:12:22] those Roman soldiers smacking him in the
[2:12:25] face using Whatever Gets in his hand in
[2:12:28] their hands
[2:12:32] his face was so disfigured
[2:12:38] they pull out every strain of beer from
[2:12:40] his face
[2:12:43] they never rush him to the to the to the
[2:12:46] to the hospital to kind of Scar his body
[2:12:49] so it has to it has to be that way to
[2:12:53] get healed
[2:12:58] that was that was the only thing that
[2:13:00] that death did for him very quickly the
[2:13:02] resurrection that was the only thing
[2:13:03] that he did for Jesus quickly he healed
[2:13:06] the wounds and the Scar left it
[2:13:12] because when he showed his hands to uh
[2:13:14] uh uh Thomas it was not bleeding
[2:13:17] but he had wounds
[2:13:23] praise the Lord he was not walking
[2:13:25] around with a blasting body
[2:13:28] but he was walking around with a body
[2:13:29] that has cast all over it
[2:13:32] to represent
[2:13:33] whatever scar that we go through
[2:13:37] praise the Lord
[2:13:40] that we can look to Calvary
[2:13:44] and use whatever the devil wants to make
[2:13:48] a stunning block and use that as a
[2:13:50] stepping stone
[2:13:51] and get closer to God
[2:13:58] praise the Lord
[2:14:00] so we have to remember that
[2:14:03] that was God's purpose he has a memorial
[2:14:07] the body
[2:14:08] sits there as a memorial a sacrifice
[2:14:14] and his Spirit comes back upon the
[2:14:18] church
[2:14:20] praise the Lord
[2:14:22] so the Holy Ghost is here to remind us
[2:14:25] that's a body
[2:14:28] Before the Throne of God
[2:14:32] that we can relate all our sorrows
[2:14:35] our pains our discipline
[2:14:39] to

[2:16:29] Lord Jesus

[2:16:56] to be able to help
[2:16:58] the Saints helped the church law to be
[2:17:00] able to appreciate
[2:17:02] your sacrifice Lord
[2:17:04] and father to realize who God
[2:17:08] that
[2:17:11] the blood that was shared the life that

[2:17:16] in our life
[2:17:17] not only things that we have done in
[2:17:22] world we are guilty of
[2:17:24] but if he thinks

[2:18:03] they even question why are they existing
