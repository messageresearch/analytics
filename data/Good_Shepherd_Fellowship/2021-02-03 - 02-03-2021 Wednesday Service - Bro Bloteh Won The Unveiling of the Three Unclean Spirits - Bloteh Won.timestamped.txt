[32:03] and i saw three unclean spirits like
[32:06] frogs
[32:08] come out of the mouth of the dragon
[32:12] and out of the mouth of the beast
[32:15] and out of the mouth of the false
[32:18] prophet
[32:21] for they are the spirits of devils
[32:25] working miracles which go
[32:29] forth unto the kings of the earth
[32:34] and of the whole world to gather
[32:38] them to the battle of
[32:41] the great dane of god
[32:44] almighty
[32:48] behold i come as a thief blessed is
[32:52] he that watch it and keep it his
[32:54] gambling
[32:55] leaves he walked naked and they see him
[33:00] and they see his shame amen
[33:03] and he gathered them together into a
[33:07] place
[33:08] called in the hebrew tongue armageddon
[33:13] let's pray together heavenly father
[33:16] lord jesus we ask your blessings tonight
[33:20] and we just pray that father you will
[33:23] come take this portion of your word we
[33:26] know your word is blessed
[33:28] and father god is already anointed
[33:31] but lord god we pray in the lord you
[33:33] anoint us tonight for speaking
[33:35] you will also anoint us for hearing and
[33:38] understanding
[33:39] dear lord father uh
[33:42] may those things be said that will draw
[33:44] us closer to you
[33:46] and father god in terms of internal
[33:49] value
[33:50] lord god net of of men
[33:54] conception lord god father for things of
[33:57] internal value
[33:59] because heaven and earth will pass away
[34:02] it's only those things of internal value
[34:04] that will remain so we ask the blessings
[34:08] now
[34:09] in jesus name we pray amen
[34:12] the lord bless you you can have your
[34:13] seat
[34:16] i just for the a little hesitation
[34:19] tonight
[34:20] if we will call it i want to just speak
[34:23] on
[34:25] the unveiling of the three unclean
[34:28] spirit
[34:32] the unveiling of the three unclean
[34:34] spirit let me
[34:35] give it a title tonight but there are
[34:38] there there are a few things that i want
[34:40] to
[34:40] look into and one of the things that i
[34:43] want to look into
[34:45] uh is where the scripture says the
[34:50] um
[34:54] let me go back there to to revelation
[34:59] chapter 16 the scripture make us to know
[35:03] that these three unclean spirit
[35:06] is gathering the entire world
[35:09] to the battle of armageddon
[35:13] praise the lord this three unclean
[35:16] spirit
[35:18] is gathering the entire world
[35:22] and that's what i want for us to look at
[35:23] tonight
[35:25] three unclean spirit like frogs that
[35:28] come out of the mouth of the dragon
[35:30] out of the mouth of the beast out of the
[35:33] mouth
[35:33] of the false prophet praise the lord
[35:37] amen
[35:41] and we know the dragon is the devil
[35:45] the beast is rome the false prophets
[35:49] i order all of the ministers that are
[35:51] under that influence
[35:55] praise the lord now
[35:59] to see that
[36:02] there is a teaching that is gathering
[36:06] the word the religious word
[36:10] for the battle of american is is very
[36:12] serious
[36:16] now so we see this from the scripture
[36:20] and we also see from from the message
[36:23] we will read that to you tonight share
[36:26] that with you which of course you you
[36:28] know there
[36:29] where brother branham says the second
[36:31] spirit
[36:32] that will lead the world to the battle
[36:34] for my guidance is
[36:35] rock and roll now
[36:38] to see how rock and roll
[36:42] is going to influence the unconverted
[36:45] world and how
[36:48] uh this three unclean spirit is going to
[36:51] influence the religious world then
[36:57] there is only one way of escape
[37:03] praise the lord there is only one way of
[37:07] escape
[37:09] and way of escape is come out of her
[37:14] the way of escape is to respond to
[37:16] revelation chapter 18
[37:18] come out of her mind people so it's
[37:21] we we either come out of uh
[37:24] the the influence of the word
[37:31] and also come out of the influence of
[37:33] the church
[37:36] are we together amen
[37:39] the reason why this is uh
[37:42] it's kind of for caught my attention i
[37:44] was reading something in the book of
[37:46] aazai
[37:47] while i was studying i'll share that
[37:49] with you too
[37:50] and uh
[37:51] [Music]
[37:55] it's it's uh it's it's very striking you
[37:58] know because
[38:00] the people don't realize that
[38:03] they actually honor a spirit
[38:09] there is no man that is that is that is
[38:11] neutral
[38:13] the decision we make and things that we
[38:15] do we are influenced
[38:18] we are getting our influence from
[38:20] somewhere
[38:22] praise the lord all the decision that is
[38:25] made in politics and everything that is
[38:27] you know that is the
[38:29] the world leaders are doing you know
[38:31] they have no idea
[38:33] that they are under an influence there
[38:36] is only two
[38:37] power one of two power that is governing
[38:40] this world
[38:41] it is either the power of the devil or
[38:44] you are under the power and the
[38:45] influence of god
[38:49] there is no neutral ground
[38:52] praise the lord there is no neutral
[38:55] ground
[38:56] and to see here that uh
[39:00] that uh the scripture here
[39:03] making us to know these three unclean
[39:06] spirit
[39:06] out of the dragon like i said revelation
[39:09] chapter 12 is satan
[39:12] the beast relation uh chapter
[39:15] 13 17 there we realize that
[39:18] is uh is the catholic church and
[39:21] uh and out of the mouth of the false
[39:23] prophets
[39:24] which of course are the people that are
[39:28] propagating their teaching
[39:34] for they are the spirits of devils
[39:37] working miracle
[39:39] which go forth in unto the kings of the
[39:42] earth
[39:43] and of the whole world to gather them
[39:48] to the battle of the great dane
[39:52] praise the lord and then the voice of
[39:55] god the voice of
[39:57] jesus just like the way john put it or
[40:00] the writers of the bible
[40:02] they have that in in in in real letter
[40:05] and says behold i come quickly
[40:09] blessed is he that watch it
[40:13] and keep it his garment
[40:17] praise the lord keep
[40:20] our garment from the steam
[40:24] of those influence
[40:28] praise the lord and because it's
[40:31] it's a spiritual influence uh
[40:35] is is requiring us uh uh ammon
[40:38] at least he walked naked and you see his
[40:42] shame
[40:43] now uh let me let me share with uh with
[40:47] you first uh
[40:49] if if the sisters can be able to pull
[40:50] put our our coach that we want to share
[40:53] with you tonight
[40:54] uh from baptism of the holy ghost
[40:58] let's let's share that with you
[41:01] and then we can go into our
[41:04] hesitation is just an exhortation
[41:06] tonight
[41:08] praise the lord the lord the lord
[41:13] amen what a wonderful
[41:17] wonderful savior with yourself
[41:20] from the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:22] brother branham says
[41:24] the places where i have been
[41:29] how does fortune tell us work
[41:32] how does evil spirit travel
[41:36] i want you to i want you to believe me
[41:39] as your pastor
[41:41] because you are the one i'm speaking to
[41:46] devils travel in the name of the father
[41:50] son and the holy ghost
[41:56] praise the lord this will kind of a
[41:59] sound buffering to you
[42:01] to many many people but devils
[42:05] travel in the name of the father's son
[42:08] and the holy ghost
[42:18] they cut feathers and everything else
[42:20] and throw spell
[42:23] on each other through the name of the
[42:26] father son
[42:27] and the holy ghost it's true it's
[42:30] written there in the scripture
[42:32] you know uh matthew chapter 18 under the
[42:35] the first commission
[42:37] you know jesus said that now go
[42:40] and and and teach our nation baptizing
[42:42] them in the name of the father
[42:44] the son and the holy ghost but we know
[42:46] that the early church
[42:48] grabbed the revelation of death amen
[42:51] we know the early church grabbed the
[42:53] revelation because there is nowhere in
[42:54] the scripture anyone was baptized in the
[42:56] name of the father son and the holy
[42:58] ghost
[42:59] but the thing about it here is that
[43:02] [Music]
[43:03] the when when pagan rome was trying to
[43:07] associate itself with the church they
[43:10] kind of
[43:11] profit on this scripture to be able to
[43:13] bring the the uh
[43:15] the uh um idol gods into
[43:19] uh to mix it with christian faith i
[43:21] think most of us we know all of that
[43:24] but the thing that is here is that uh
[43:27] uh
[43:28] [Music]
[43:32] now realizing this
[43:35] it put us to the place where it gave us
[43:38] a kind of a check
[43:40] where uh you know we realized
[43:44] that there are a lot of things that have
[43:45] become like a cliche for the church
[43:49] you know things are just used you know i
[43:52] mean
[43:53] when a person says you know the name of
[43:55] jesus
[43:56] it just sounds like well i think he must
[43:58] be a christian if now he's not you will
[44:00] not be using the name of jesus
[44:03] praise the lord let me let me share
[44:05] something with you
[44:06] it's a it's all missionary story
[44:10] and uh this this this uh old preacher
[44:14] you know uh uh i mean he was like uh
[44:17] like a satellite preacher he goes around
[44:20] preaching on his horses
[44:22] and and he taught his horses
[44:25] to be able to to uh
[44:28] to listen to him you know certain words
[44:30] he would say
[44:31] and they will be able to listen to it
[44:34] and uh
[44:34] uh and he had he had this hurts
[44:38] that would really gets to running i mean
[44:41] it will it will put his
[44:42] you know legs in the air that would jump
[44:44] and do different things
[44:46] when he says hallelujah
[44:50] you know when he says hallelujah that
[44:52] horse just go
[44:53] jumping you know it just get in and get
[44:56] and he says hallelujah it goes chomping
[44:58] you know
[44:59] just like that and then when he says
[45:01] amen
[45:02] the hearse comes to a stop
[45:06] amen that's how he taught that hurts how
[45:10] to
[45:10] how to ride but then it came a time
[45:13] where he got older
[45:15] and uh and someone wanted to buy
[45:20] the rehearsal he told the person you
[45:22] know this is the way to get the hearse
[45:25] running and uh
[45:29] and and the guy tried tried and
[45:32] and he you know he enjoyed it and he
[45:35] bought it rehearsing started going
[45:39] and he went for the ride but uh the
[45:42] thing there is that
[45:44] he really never uh
[45:49] i mean he just got so excited so he he
[45:52] decided that i mean this is this is
[45:54] wonderful this
[45:55] this is never seen but you have to
[45:58] realize
[45:59] also that this preacher had a
[46:02] relationship
[46:04] with the hearse you know
[46:07] i mean i mean he he have used it on many
[46:10] traits
[46:11] you know and and he there was there was
[46:13] a connection
[46:16] there's those words were not just a
[46:18] cliche to the to the minister
[46:24] and this this young
[46:27] he bought the hearse and he decided to
[46:29] take the hearse on the mountain
[46:33] and as he kept you know as he kept
[46:36] saying hallelujah
[46:38] her skip kept going in you know and and
[46:42] going in
[46:42] i mean running and you know just i mean
[46:46] and you were just enjoying the rock then
[46:48] he taught oh my goodness
[46:50] how am i going to bring it to stop
[46:55] you know and it's almost like he kind of
[46:59] forgot you know
[47:02] and he started trying different things
[47:07] now one there is that it shows that he
[47:10] did not have a relationship with the
[47:11] hearse
[47:12] and another thing there is that uh uh
[47:15] saying hallelujah to have the hearse
[47:17] going was just a cliche
[47:22] praise the lord but the hearse was
[47:25] growing
[47:26] almost to a cliff
[47:31] you know and then he was going through
[47:32] his mind oh my goodness
[47:34] i forgot what you know and then
[47:39] then he remember just when the hearse
[47:43] was
[47:43] getting to the cliff he remember
[47:46] that is amen
[47:50] and he says amen and the hearse came to
[47:53] to his top so wow hallelujah
[47:57] [Music]
[48:04] let's talk about the rest of the story
[48:05] come and meet me in the office
[48:12] now that's what happened you know to
[48:14] many christians
[48:17] you know certain words become cliche you
[48:19] know and people say amen
[48:21] now even understanding what the preacher
[48:23] is saying they just say amen because if
[48:25] he that
[48:26] you say amen to wait
[48:31] but sometimes those things throw you
[48:33] over the cliff
[48:39] we'll talk the rest of the story
[48:44] now so jerry said that brother branham
[48:47] is telling us and he's he's actually
[48:51] he's actually telling us from traveling
[48:54] experience this is not
[48:56] this is not really in the book
[48:59] he says from the places that i have been
[49:05] and i mean i could throw some few
[49:07] experiences
[49:08] in there uh uh you know and
[49:11] and and you know you have you have
[49:14] different different groups
[49:16] you know and then and and they all bring
[49:19] their strange worship
[49:21] right back to catholicism
[49:26] that's right amen
[49:29] they bring their strange worship right
[49:32] back
[49:32] to catholicism it will be it will be
[49:34] surprising to you
[49:36] that even uh uh some of
[49:39] the the islamic approach goes right back
[49:42] to catholicism
[49:46] praise the lord the rolling of the beast
[49:52] in your prayer it goes back to
[49:56] catholicism
[49:59] are we together now so
[50:02] it's it's uh you know like brother
[50:04] branham says here he says uh
[50:07] he says he says he's listen to me on
[50:10] this
[50:10] you know devil travel in the name of the
[50:14] father son
[50:15] and the holy ghost now it does not make
[50:18] father son and the holy ghost wrong
[50:24] praise the lord but these
[50:27] these impersonators
[50:30] are wrongly they are disguising
[50:33] themselves

[50:41] a drew me

[54:31] i have a way of drawing them to me
[54:38] i will not be a widow i'm a lady i know
[54:41] what to do
[54:43] that's what she's saying to god i know
[54:46] exactly what to do
[54:48] so in every age i will have my influence
[54:55] i know exactly what to do
[55:00] so it's a spirit
[55:04] it's a spirit
[55:10] are we together
[55:13] now that's the thing that kind of caught
[55:15] my attention on this
[55:18] that's the thing that is that that
[55:20] caught my attention on this
[55:22] revelation chapter 17 verse 2 let us
[55:25] know that
[55:26] you know she have committed a
[55:27] fornication with the kings of the earth
[55:30] a man should have got the nation drunk
[55:32] with a wine of a fornication
[55:37] and brother branham taught us all of
[55:38] that what it means
[55:40] her influence has gone out
[55:47] are we together how influence ah
[55:51] it's all over the place you can see it
[55:54] in politics
[55:56] get in the business world you can see it
[55:58] in the business world
[56:02] and her influence is pre-dominating
[56:06] the church that is the reason why
[56:10] christ is the mystery of god reveal
[56:15] the threefold purpose that brother
[56:18] branham taught us in christ
[56:20] is the mystery of god reveal it's only
[56:23] the bride
[56:26] we bring preeminence to christ
[56:33] now if if if babylon if this spirit is
[56:36] seen
[56:37] i'm not going to be a widow i'm going to
[56:40] be a lady
[56:43] no i'm not going to be challenged
[56:46] she has her influence everywhere
[56:51] yeah i i wouldn't even bite my tongue to
[56:54] say
[56:54] there are a lot of people sitting under
[56:56] the message that i honor this
[56:58] influence
[57:05] praise the lord anything shocked there
[57:07] is no neutral ground
[57:09] anything shot in lack of the holy spirit
[57:12] you are under the other influence
[57:19] praise the lord
[57:22] i mean you can put a title on your
[57:24] forehead you know the bride of christ
[57:27] the message of the hour the ego age
[57:33] it's not the name you call yourself it's
[57:35] the influence that you are honored
[57:40] it's the influence that you honor
[57:48] are we together
[57:54] so brother branham says uh they caught
[57:57] feathers and everything the troll spells
[58:00] on each other through the name of father
[58:02] son and the holy ghost
[58:04] and uh they call it
[58:07] the three high names
[58:10] now what he's talking here is
[58:13] is demonology what he's talking about
[58:17] here is demonology
[58:20] time is not on our hand to go into that
[58:22] tonight
[58:23] you know the the mother of uh of faith
[58:27] is catholic church they go to these
[58:30] little statues and they knee down and
[58:32] they caught feathers
[58:34] with caesars and they turn their back
[58:36] and throw spells on their neighbor
[58:38] you know and and and all of them
[58:42] in all of that we know you know uh uh
[58:44] brother branham
[58:45] identify what those three unclean spirit
[58:47] is the trinity doctrine
[58:50] you know but uh uh this is
[58:54] this is in a more broad form to see how
[58:56] that doctrine
[58:58] is is the influence of every false
[59:02] religion
[59:06] of every false religion of any
[59:09] of everything that take people away from
[59:16] christ
[59:21] praise the lord
[59:26] and hear he said revelation is telling
[59:30] us
[59:32] is drawing the people away from christ
[59:36] and yet preparing them
[59:39] for the battle
[59:43] of their destruction preparing them for
[59:46] their destruction
[59:56] praise the lord okay i have a few
[59:58] minutes here stay
[1:00:07] now the beautiful thing there in the
[1:00:09] scripture
[1:00:11] is the other
[1:00:15] you know structure don't stand alone
[1:00:19] you know like uh
[1:00:23] brother brandon would say
[1:00:26] let's let's look at something here also
[1:00:38] there with me tonight praise the lord
[1:00:42] amen revelation i know
[1:00:46] matthew chapter 13 matthew chapter 13.
[1:00:58] matthew chapter 13. let's read verse 33
[1:01:02] another parable speak he unto them jesus
[1:01:05] speak
[1:01:06] unto his disciples the kingdom of heaven
[1:01:09] is
[1:01:09] like onto living
[1:01:12] which a woman talked and hid
[1:01:16] it in three measures
[1:01:20] of wheat till the hole
[1:01:23] was living praise the lord
[1:01:27] in the church ages brother branham
[1:01:29] brought this scripture
[1:01:30] in us chapter 2 when the mess multitude
[1:01:34] came into the church amen
[1:01:38] he says that's where the living was
[1:01:40] brought into the church by that miss
[1:01:42] multitude that joined the church
[1:01:45] just like the miss multitude in in in
[1:01:48] moses exeter but then also
[1:01:52] brother brandon make us to know the the
[1:01:54] the three measure
[1:01:56] of meal was the trinity doctrine
[1:02:08] are we together
[1:02:20] the three measure of meal till
[1:02:23] the whole was living
[1:02:28] and yet jesus liking this to the kingdom
[1:02:31] of god
[1:02:32] which of course the mistreat of the
[1:02:34] kingdom of god brother branham says
[1:02:36] is the masonic kingdom which is a type
[1:02:39] of the church
[1:02:44] so the kingdom of god in this parable
[1:02:46] was
[1:02:47] the church in type
[1:02:52] are we together amen
[1:02:55] the kingdom of heaven sorry uh yeah
[1:02:59] so we we see that i mean it's all
[1:03:03] through the scripture
[1:03:04] it's all through the scripture the last
[1:03:07] time we run
[1:03:08] a parallel of babylon and in jerusalem
[1:03:13] uh i write from the beginning so
[1:03:16] uh but we realized that
[1:03:21] uh this is
[1:03:24] saturn mechanism
[1:03:28] what he's using to prepare his people
[1:03:36] the scripture says the two spirit will
[1:03:38] be so close that if possible
[1:03:40] the iliad will be deceived we thank god
[1:03:44] that by predestination is not possible
[1:03:48] praise the lord because the lord knows
[1:03:49] those that are hate amen
[1:03:52] and he have preserved us for that for
[1:03:54] that then
[1:03:55] praise the lord let's take another court
[1:03:57] here a shame of him
[1:04:07] brother branham says don't be ashamed of
[1:04:12] him
[1:04:12] in this generation sinful perplexed
[1:04:16] the last generation that will ever be on
[1:04:19] earth
[1:04:20] this sinful adulterous and fall
[1:04:23] of all petrified souls
[1:04:28] all everything that's been decent has
[1:04:32] become
[1:04:33] indecent national politics felt
[1:04:36] nations are broken up way back in the
[1:04:39] jungle of
[1:04:40] africa the sapphire hunters he says uh
[1:04:43] they had to take high power radio to
[1:04:47] to to year ever presley and pot born
[1:04:52] and and and today we can say
[1:04:55] all the rap music has all gone to this
[1:04:58] jungle
[1:05:01] they love the beats
[1:05:06] it has all gone there praise the lord
[1:05:10] what took he did the same spirit
[1:05:22] and them guys with the rock and roll and
[1:05:25] twist
[1:05:26] the natives trying to see them at alone
[1:05:30] checking their heads you know just like
[1:05:33] what you see all the boys doing with the
[1:05:35] rap music moving their heads up and down
[1:05:38] acting like that the natives stood and
[1:05:41] looked at it but
[1:05:43] you see they are not american like pat
[1:05:46] bone
[1:05:47] and eva presley and ricky nelson and
[1:05:50] this
[1:05:51] and and and them guys are
[1:05:54] he says talking to these guys he says
[1:05:56] that they are judases
[1:05:58] of of that type see it's a spirit
[1:06:04] it's a spirit
[1:06:07] and the spirit is not only in america
[1:06:11] it spread itself all over the world
[1:06:16] to bring them
[1:06:20] to the battle of armageddon
[1:06:27] praise the lord so you see that's the
[1:06:30] reason why
[1:06:31] they unconverted church that don't have
[1:06:34] the word to feed the people
[1:06:36] what what they use just music just
[1:06:38] entertaining
[1:06:44] that's the reason why you cannot tell
[1:06:46] the difference between
[1:06:47] the music of the church and the music of
[1:06:50] the world why because they are all under
[1:06:52] the same spirit
[1:07:02] preparing the people
[1:07:06] praise the lord
[1:07:10] now if ever if a father
[1:07:14] the the the the the influence
[1:07:18] if the influence of those three unclean
[1:07:21] spirit
[1:07:21] is preparing the entire world
[1:07:27] what a church word or natural word
[1:07:32] they are all under that influence
[1:07:37] then there is a spirit also to prepare
[1:07:40] the bride
[1:07:44] praise the lord there's a spirit to
[1:07:47] prepare the bride
[1:07:51] for the rapture
[1:07:55] amen there's a there's a spirit to
[1:07:58] prepare the bride to face
[1:08:00] her own the greatest battle that is
[1:08:01] going on because you have to get out of
[1:08:03] here
[1:08:08] are we together
[1:08:12] now you will see in in the book of
[1:08:22] revelation
[1:08:25] the beautiful thing here is that there's
[1:08:27] there's something that is
[1:08:29] that is uh uh a little bit out of my
[1:08:32] on my uh kind of a step over here from
[1:08:36] my notes
[1:08:36] but you will see here that in revelation
[1:08:39] chapter 16
[1:08:41] there's a spirit there is an anointing
[1:08:45] that expose the three unclean spirit
[1:08:50] amen there is an anointing that exposed
[1:08:53] the three
[1:08:54] unclean spirit and what is that
[1:08:56] anointing is the anointing of christ
[1:09:01] amen when he said behold i come
[1:09:04] quickly now you see just just by
[1:09:07] inspiration the way the scripture is
[1:09:10] placed
[1:09:12] amen when it talks about the on the
[1:09:14] unclean spirit verse 14 talks about
[1:09:17] you know there will be working miracles
[1:09:19] and in all the kings of the earth and
[1:09:21] the whole earth
[1:09:22] verse 15 comes in and says behold i
[1:09:26] come as a thief whose voice is there
[1:09:29] that's the voice of christ
[1:09:31] amen and if it is the voice of christ
[1:09:34] then it is the same voice in revelation
[1:09:37] chapter 3
[1:09:38] 14 which means
[1:09:41] at the coming of christ at the revealing
[1:09:45] of christ in the end time
[1:09:47] this unclean spirit will be exposed
[1:09:52] that is the reason why it took the
[1:09:54] ministry of brother branham to tell
[1:09:56] what the unclean spirit is
[1:10:00] because it's the ministry of jesus
[1:10:02] christ
[1:10:07] are you seeing the connection
[1:10:11] just at the time were the spirit
[1:10:14] these three unclean spirit
[1:10:18] as as as as his revere to john
[1:10:22] is is is is preparing the people for the
[1:10:25] great day
[1:10:27] right in the middle just look at his
[1:10:29] right between
[1:10:30] verse 14 and verse 16 before the
[1:10:33] the the whole explanation the spirit
[1:10:36] will gather them for the great day but
[1:10:37] right in the midst of that behold i come
[1:10:39] as a thief
[1:10:44] praise the lord even the expression
[1:10:48] of coming as a thief is an expression
[1:10:51] that is tied to the rapture
[1:10:55] so their spirit these three unclean
[1:10:57] spirit could never be exposed in no time
[1:11:00] it has to be in the rapture in time
[1:11:08] so right in that time the ministry of
[1:11:11] jesus
[1:11:12] christ is going to expose these three
[1:11:14] unclean spirits
[1:11:17] it's going to make us to know what
[1:11:19] really it is what is a purpose
[1:11:28] are we together now so if this
[1:11:32] if this revelation 16 verse 15
[1:11:36] is tied to revelation chapter 3
[1:11:40] the ministry of jesus christ in the
[1:11:42] laodicea church age that's what i'm
[1:11:44] talking about
[1:11:47] praise the lord then you can see why
[1:11:52] in revelation chapter 4 there was
[1:11:55] an emphasis of speaking about
[1:11:59] one on the throne
[1:12:02] when john looked after he was caught
[1:12:06] out of the age come up higher he said
[1:12:09] when i turned a look i saw
[1:12:11] one on the tron
[1:12:16] are we together
[1:12:24] because what is what has been described
[1:12:27] here by john
[1:12:29] is unhappy it is something that is
[1:12:31] happening
[1:12:32] in the last church age
[1:12:35] it's something that will be revealed in
[1:12:37] the last church age
[1:12:39] in a time where he will come as a thief
[1:12:42] in the night
[1:12:42] it's a rapturing statement
[1:12:49] one will be two will be sleeping i would
[1:12:51] take one i will leave one that's a
[1:12:53] rapturing statement
[1:12:58] so it's the same voice that is speaking
[1:13:01] in revelation chapter three
[1:13:05] is the ministry of jesus christ
[1:13:13] now but then in revelation chapter 3
[1:13:16] after the church ages revelation chapter
[1:13:18] 4 comes from the scene
[1:13:20] and the bible says and john says i had a
[1:13:22] voice that said come up higher
[1:13:26] the same voice that spoke to john
[1:13:29] and says i will show thee what the
[1:13:31] meaning of these things in the church
[1:13:33] ages is the same voice that is telling
[1:13:35] him now
[1:13:36] come come up higher and when john
[1:13:40] was caught up higher in revelation
[1:13:42] chapter four
[1:13:43] when he looked he only saw one on the
[1:13:46] throne
[1:13:52] praise the lord he only saw one
[1:13:55] on the throne
[1:13:59] are we together now so it put us to the
[1:14:03] place where
[1:14:05] that is the reason why the truth
[1:14:08] understanding
[1:14:09] the true understanding of the godhead
[1:14:14] not just church understanding this is
[1:14:16] the way our church
[1:14:17] i believe it praise the lord because the
[1:14:21] godhead
[1:14:22] holds your identity
[1:14:26] because jesus said in that day you will
[1:14:29] know
[1:14:30] that i am in the father amen
[1:14:34] i am you and you in me
[1:14:45] are we together
[1:14:48] so it's uh
[1:14:52] is uh
[1:14:56] it holds the identity of the true
[1:14:59] believers
[1:15:04] praise the lord
[1:15:08] there are some other few things i could
[1:15:10] go into tonight but
[1:15:12] the time will not allow us
[1:15:15] but just like we spoke uh i mean a
[1:15:18] couple of
[1:15:19] months ago if i can remember you know uh
[1:15:22] talking about you can make jesus
[1:15:26] his own father
[1:15:31] you see that's that is the danger that
[1:15:34] comes in when many
[1:15:36] you know around the message that i
[1:15:38] understand you know what jesus is god
[1:15:40] they just take that thought of jesus is
[1:15:42] god
[1:15:43] and now following the proper teaching of
[1:15:45] what brother branham taught
[1:15:54] are we together
[1:15:58] because it holds the identity
[1:16:02] of every son and daughter of god
[1:16:10] praise the lord jesus said
[1:16:13] in saint john chapter 1 he says
[1:16:16] he came unto his own and his own receive
[1:16:19] him that
[1:16:20] but as many that receive him he has
[1:16:22] given them
[1:16:23] power to become sons
[1:16:27] and daughters of god amen
[1:16:31] no we were already sons and daughters of
[1:16:33] god
[1:16:36] we were already sons and daughters of
[1:16:38] god
[1:16:39] so you see the revelation of the godhead
[1:16:42] restore our sonship
[1:16:46] empower us
[1:16:50] praise the lord to know that we don't
[1:16:53] belong to an organization
[1:16:55] we don't belong to a church we don't
[1:16:57] belong to a pastor
[1:16:58] we belong to god
[1:17:11] there is just only one mediator between
[1:17:14] god and man
[1:17:15] that's the man christ jesus
[1:17:20] oh my goodness that's that's another
[1:17:22] subject in itself
[1:17:25] that's another subject in itself
[1:17:30] praise the lord is another subject in
[1:17:33] itself
[1:17:34] there is only one man one mediator
[1:17:38] between man and god the man christ jesus
[1:17:47] so you see yeah you know we don't we
[1:17:50] we we shouldn't at because we're living
[1:17:54] in a day where the scripture says
[1:17:57] he that have an ear let him hear what
[1:18:00] the spirit says
[1:18:03] praise the lord and let him hear what
[1:18:06] the spirit says to the church
[1:18:09] and make sure you are hearing from the
[1:18:11] spirit when you say amen
[1:18:15] or you say hallelujah
[1:18:19] because you might find yourself going
[1:18:20] off the cliff
[1:18:24] or you must find yourself stopping that
[1:18:26] power
[1:18:27] from carrying you any further
[1:18:31] you're not just going by cliches
[1:18:36] you're going by revelation because you
[1:18:38] hear him speaking to you
[1:18:44] it's just like that little boy i've
[1:18:45] never seen a mirror
[1:18:47] and he comes he says that's me
[1:18:52] he was not seeing anyone else in the
[1:18:54] world he was seeing himself
[1:18:56] he said that's me papa come and see
[1:18:58] that's me
[1:19:05] praise the lord i used to say back
[1:19:07] before if you look in the mirror
[1:19:09] and you see someone else i mean you go
[1:19:13] fist in your head and you look in the
[1:19:15] mirror and see someone else
[1:19:18] you might be strong not to yell
[1:19:22] praise the lord
[1:19:26] or you it will have to be some kind of a
[1:19:28] contrary spirit that would be bringing
[1:19:30] somebody else instead of bringing
[1:19:31] yourself
[1:19:32] in the mirror praise the lord but
[1:19:36] let's wrap this up tonight so that won't
[1:19:38] keep you long
[1:19:40] just watch this
[1:19:44] the influence that this word
[1:19:48] is honor
[1:19:51] it's such a strong influence it's such a
[1:19:54] strong
[1:19:55] influence because babylon has said
[1:20:00] i'm not going to be a widow
[1:20:04] i would find some kind of a system to
[1:20:06] get marital
[1:20:11] i would i would give birth
[1:20:15] to children
[1:20:19] and every organization
[1:20:22] is giving birth to babylon
[1:20:25] every organization
[1:20:29] every religion
[1:20:33] roots run right back to babylon
[1:20:40] so you see the call of revelation 18
[1:20:44] 4 come out of her my people
[1:20:48] and be not partaker
[1:20:51] that call of revelation chapter 4
[1:20:53] because brother branham says
[1:20:55] he says he says
[1:20:59] revelation chapter four is tied to
[1:21:01] revelation at uh
[1:21:03] revelation chapter eighteen four that's
[1:21:05] what i wanna say
[1:21:06] revelation chapter eighteen four he says
[1:21:09] when jesus was standing at the church
[1:21:12] door in revelation chapter
[1:21:14] 3 he said behold i stand at the door and
[1:21:16] knock
[1:21:18] praise the lord he said because the
[1:21:21] church
[1:21:21] closed its door on him
[1:21:25] he says then that's when the voice of
[1:21:27] revelation chapter 18 4
[1:21:29] went out and said come out of all my
[1:21:31] people
[1:21:36] praise the lord if you if you follow
[1:21:39] brother branham ministry
[1:21:40] you will you will also see that in the
[1:21:43] early part of brother branham ministry
[1:21:45] he told the people stay with your church
[1:21:47] be loyal to your church a little part of
[1:21:51] his ministry he said come out of that
[1:21:58] he said come out of her yes sir
[1:22:03] why because it was the voice of
[1:22:05] revelation 3
[1:22:08] 20.
[1:22:17] are we together
[1:22:24] that's the reason why you realize that
[1:22:30] brother branham influenced messages that
[1:22:33] he preached
[1:22:36] he ties it to revelation to isaiah
[1:22:39] chapter 6.
[1:22:42] amen and we
[1:22:45] and and uh who were those beings that
[1:22:48] was having
[1:22:49] influence on isaiah they were heavenly
[1:22:52] beings
[1:22:55] praise the lord
[1:22:58] who were those beings that were having
[1:23:00] influence on isaiah
[1:23:02] they were heavenly beings
[1:23:06] and that's the reason why it took seven
[1:23:08] injures to bring
[1:23:09] our influence
[1:23:15] our influence is coming from the opening
[1:23:17] of the seals
[1:23:22] praise the lord now if i drop back a
[1:23:26] little bit till sunday
[1:23:27] that's the reason why i said
[1:23:34] on the treasure is what we are
[1:23:37] treasuring
[1:23:38] in
[1:23:43] the revelation of the world is what we
[1:23:45] are treasuring in
[1:23:47] the opening of the seals is what we are
[1:23:49] treasuring because that's where our
[1:23:51] influence is coming from
[1:24:02] praise the lord read the book of isaiah
[1:24:04] you will realize
[1:24:05] right after uh isaiah chapter 6
[1:24:09] his ministry changed he was looking to
[1:24:12] the future
[1:24:13] isaiah chapter 7 behold a virgin shall
[1:24:16] conceive
[1:24:19] his ministry was no longer an affluent
[1:24:21] ministry again
[1:24:22] he started prophesying about the future
[1:24:25] about the millennium
[1:24:26] about the judgment to come
[1:24:32] he was taken from earth
[1:24:36] by those angels yet on earth but he was
[1:24:40] taken from earth
[1:24:44] praise the lord amen
[1:24:50] you might see us walking around here but
[1:24:52] our influence is from above
[1:24:55] we might be going to the same grocery
[1:24:57] stores like them
[1:24:59] but we are not on earth
[1:25:02] praise the lord because where your
[1:25:04] treasure is
[1:25:05] there your heart will be gathered
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:09] if your treasure is in the world your
[1:25:11] heart will be
[1:25:16] wherever the man goes he thinks about
[1:25:19] his treasure
[1:25:20] his treasure is on his mind
[1:25:38] we see the influence that is on this
[1:25:40] word young people
[1:25:41] the spirit that is on this word
[1:25:48] is not something to desire why i cannot
[1:25:51] be like young
[1:25:52] other young people because you are not
[1:25:54] called to be like other young people
[1:25:56] you are called to be like jesus christ
[1:25:59] you are called to be like the word in
[1:26:01] your age
[1:26:08] of course they are not going to
[1:26:09] understand you because their influence
[1:26:12] and your influence is too
[1:26:13] different influence and man looks like
[1:26:17] there is no pressure on them
[1:26:19] they are preparing for their battle
[1:26:21] while you are fighting your battle
[1:26:26] you are fighting your battle which is
[1:26:27] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:26:30] while their influence is preparing they
[1:26:32] are preparing them for their battle
[1:26:35] and is preparing them for destruction
[1:26:50] musicians you can come
[1:26:56] if the lord gave us grace we will
[1:26:57] continue
[1:26:59] amen that's the reason why we want to
[1:27:04] keep our eyes on jesus
[1:27:08] amen we are conforming to his image he's
[1:27:11] the one that is having influence on us
[1:27:24] i mean sometimes you you you hear people
[1:27:27] talking
[1:27:29] you know and and it gets so adamant and
[1:27:32] it gets so
[1:27:33] argumentative you know trying to prove
[1:27:37] that their understanding of the godhead
[1:27:40] of of one god
[1:27:43] is not as much as as as trinity
[1:27:46] doctrine now think about it like this
[1:27:49] the muslims
[1:27:50] believe in one god that they call allah
[1:27:52] but yet they are under the influence
[1:27:54] of a trinitarian teaching
[1:27:59] amen the buddhists believe in one god
[1:28:02] but yet they are under the influence
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:11] praise the lord why because they believe
[1:28:14] in one god
[1:28:15] that they don't have an identity tone
[1:28:18] their god is estranged from them
[1:28:24] our god he's in us and we are in him
[1:28:30] our identity goes back to him
[1:28:50] the age is closing up people
[1:28:54] since the age is closing up
[1:28:59] these influence are becoming strong
[1:29:02] they are becoming strong can you believe
[1:29:05] people that preach this message
[1:29:07] are turning back to go back to preach
[1:29:09] trinity and doctrine
[1:29:13] they said well we don't believe in the
[1:29:14] trinity anymore
[1:29:17] but if you leave the revelation of jesus
[1:29:19] christ
[1:29:20] you are getting right under that
[1:29:22] influence there is no middle ground
[1:29:25] there is no middle ground you are either
[1:29:28] under the influence of christ or you are
[1:29:30] under the influence of the three unclean
[1:29:32] spirit
[1:29:34] believe whatever you want to believe
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:47] let me tell you something the influence
[1:29:49] of jesus christ
[1:29:52] will change you from glory to glory
[1:29:58] you will feel the effect
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:02] you will feel the effect of the
[1:30:04] influence of jesus
[1:30:06] if you think you are honor his influence
[1:30:08] and you have arrived
[1:30:10] and nobody can teach you anything
[1:30:11] different you know what you need to know
[1:30:14] you better check that influence
[1:30:18] because the influence of jesus will move
[1:30:21] you from glory to glory
[1:30:23] it will give you a constant desire for
[1:30:25] god
[1:30:28] you will get a thirst like you have
[1:30:30] never had before
[1:30:43] turn your eyes
[1:30:50] look for in his wand of full faith
[1:31:02] the face of
[1:31:06] earth we grew strange
[1:31:16] of his glory
[1:31:20] and grace
[1:31:31] have on jesus
[1:31:37] look in his
[1:31:42] one
[1:31:49] and the things of
[1:31:53] earth we grow strength
