[45:25] one of the first person that took on
[45:27] doing translation in the French language
[45:30] and um you know in some foreign language
[45:33] over there in Europe and and down to
[45:36] Africa most French countries were
[45:39] affected by some of uh the work that he
[45:41] was doing so he pleased the Lord after
[45:46] almost about 8090 years old he went to
[45:48] be with the Lord yesterday praise the
[45:51] Lord so
[45:53] uh so many people are going home
[45:57] Heaven is becoming
[45:58] exciting praise the Lord with all the
[46:02] sad things that are happening on Earth
[46:04] Heaven is becoming
[46:05] exciting when when when when the sins
[46:08] cross over praise the Lord and uh uh
[46:13] just just thinking about it you know
[46:15] thinking about it uh uh speaking to uh a
[46:19] friend of mine um from Zimbabwe he was
[46:24] traveling out of the Congo from the
[46:26] convention and and uh he was over in in
[46:30] Alis Ababa
[46:31] Ethiopia and uh you know what he told me
[46:34] oh my you know all of these things
[46:36] happening all of these you know
[46:39] men going home I said well Jesus
[46:44] said when he was here he says the
[46:47] Harvest is
[46:48] ready the laborers are
[46:51] few he said pray to the Lord of the
[46:54] Harvest he was the lord of the Harvest
[46:57] so he can send laborers into his field
[47:00] praise the Lord that's what he said that
[47:03] we should pray so he can send laborers
[47:06] but now that very same law of the
[47:09] Harvest is beginning to call laborers of
[47:11] the field it's a sign that Harvest is
[47:15] over praise the lord it's a sign that
[47:19] Harvest is

[1:05:00] 1 Jude 1 just 1
[1:05:04] to4 it WR on this wise that Jude the
[1:05:08] servant of Jesus Christ and brother of
[1:05:12] James to them that are Sanctified by God
[1:05:15] the father and preserved in Jesus Christ
[1:05:17] and
[1:05:19] called Mercy unto you and peace and love
[1:05:24] be multiplied
[1:05:26] belov when I give all the legend to
[1:05:28] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:05:31] it is needful for me to write unto you
[1:05:34] and exalt you that you you should
[1:05:38] earnestly contend for the faith which
[1:05:40] was one delivered unto the sins Jud is
[1:05:44] saying here for there are certain men
[1:05:47] crept in on aware who we before of
[1:05:51] old ordain to this condemnation on Godly
[1:05:56] men turning the grace of our Lord God
[1:05:58] into lasv yourness and denying the holy
[1:06:01] Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:06:04] Lord bless his way in our heart in Jesus
[1:06:06] name amen may you be
[1:06:11] seated
[1:06:13] um knowing the time that we're living in
[1:06:15] and the hour that we're living in I just
[1:06:17] feel like taking a title this morning um
[1:06:20] to speak to you on earnestly contend for
[1:06:24] the restor Fai for enly contend for the
[1:06:29] restore Faith by Malachi 4 amen we know
[1:06:33] that um the Lord sent Malachi 4am to
[1:06:37] restore the faith back and not to
[1:06:39] fulfill Malachi 4 to turn our heart back
[1:06:41] to the faith amen of the uh Apostolic
[1:06:45] fathers so we know that and that is a
[1:06:48] message we receive is a message of
[1:06:51] restoration uh bringing back to us all
[1:06:54] those things that the early Apostle had
[1:06:57] so you know they have the original Faith
[1:06:59] amen and we called the alpha church and
[1:07:03] today we are called the Omega Church
[1:07:06] that is why uh the vision the prophetic
[1:07:09] Vision given to the prophet amen he saw
[1:07:12] us walking in the same step Onward
[1:07:15] Christian Soldier so that he might be
[1:07:17] the Alpha and the Omega so uh he has
[1:07:21] given us this faith in order to produce
[1:07:23] a perfect Church on the earth so let us
[1:07:26] um earnestly contend for their faith now
[1:07:30] BR Braham was speaking in a message
[1:07:32] titled earnestly content for the
[1:07:35] faith so he was saying here 1955 said
[1:07:39] now I believe that this book was written
[1:07:42] in
[1:07:42] a66 and it was 33 years then after
[1:07:47] Pentecost and Jude speaking to the
[1:07:51] church then was exalting them that they
[1:07:55] should enly contended for the faith that
[1:07:58] was once delivered to the
[1:08:01] Saints now the prophet here is saying to
[1:08:05] inly contend for the faith not just a
[1:08:08] faith but the faith that was was deliver
[1:08:12] to the
[1:08:15] Saints now Jude is saying there speaking
[1:08:18] primarily of course to the church amen
[1:08:22] of that day not unbelievers not the
[1:08:25] outside us amen he was speaking to those
[1:08:28] who are Sanctified and called amen
[1:08:32] because the word Sanctified means being
[1:08:34] cleansed and set aside for God's Own
[1:08:37] service Hallelujah and these are the one
[1:08:40] that Jude is addressing not the
[1:08:42] unbeliever amen so it's primarily of
[1:08:45] course to the Church of that day that we
[1:08:47] should earnestly contend for the faith
[1:08:49] that was once delivered to the
[1:08:51] sins now I said let us stop here a few
[1:08:55] moments
[1:08:56] anly contending for the faith now what
[1:08:59] is it to contend brother say what is it
[1:09:03] to earnestly contend for is say contend
[1:09:07] is to debate yes are you with me amen
[1:09:11] amen it said to debate amen or to stand
[1:09:16] there and hold fast on your
[1:09:19] conviction amen amen not to back up not
[1:09:23] to be silent about it because when good
[1:09:25] people keep silence then evil Prevail
[1:09:29] praise God but the good ones should be
[1:09:31] able to stand up Amen to speak for what
[1:09:35] is Right deliberate on their conviction
[1:09:38] yes Hallelujah not being about it not
[1:09:40] backed up not be ashamed of the Gospel
[1:09:43] praise God in as much that they are
[1:09:45] convinced that what they are saying is
[1:09:48] right they to stand for it depend for it
[1:09:53] not been C back by by it
[1:09:55] amen see it's a confusion for what early
[1:09:59] content for the fa not just a
[1:10:02] Fai the Fai somebody say well brother
[1:10:07] that read my
[1:10:09] faith I don't I I say I don't believe
[1:10:11] that amen he said there's only one Faith
[1:10:15] Hallelujah One Faith one Lord one
[1:10:19] baptism and that faith of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:22] Christ just only one faith amen see so
[1:10:27] now remember this is J 33 years after
[1:10:30] the inauguration of the church at
[1:10:32] Pentecost 33 years amen 33 years later
[1:10:36] there has been such a falling away from
[1:10:40] that Faith that's right that early
[1:10:42] Apostolic church with Apostolic Doctrine
[1:10:45] Apostolic teaching there have such a

[1:11:03] Saints now we can if we can only find

[1:11:33] house amen so the faith they have in the
[1:11:36] gospel of that day was not just only for
[1:11:38] them was it so sufficient for their
[1:11:41] children for the promise is unto you and
[1:11:44] to your children and to them that are
[1:11:47] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:11:50] call is God still

[1:12:17] bad today that many times people and
[1:12:20] don't know what it means to repent Amen
[1:12:23] in the church young people BN in the
[1:12:25] church raise up in the church but they
[1:12:27] don't know what repentance is all about
[1:12:30] amen just a simple thing as repentance
[1:12:32] just turn around right you are going
[1:12:35] this way before and you this is not
[1:12:38] right change your ways change your
[1:12:43] perspective praise God and sometime you
[1:12:46] know the pastor the past to tr to speak
[1:12:50] to them and try to exort them to
[1:12:53] encourage them and uh tell them oh
[1:12:55] sister or brother this thing you are
[1:12:57] doing is not okay this is not fair look
[1:13:01] at what the word said this is what the
[1:13:02] Bible said this is what the prophet said
[1:13:05] you shouldn't do it don't go that way
[1:13:07] and they just stand like that and look
[1:13:09] at the pastor and after he has finished
[1:13:11] speaking they just tell the pastor God
[1:13:14] bless you Pastor thank you and they walk
[1:13:17] away is that repentance
[1:13:19] no is that how to repent amen the word
[1:13:23] repent that you realize that you being
[1:13:25] convicted that you are wrong are you
[1:13:27] feel and the Bible say prove all this
[1:13:31] and hold fast to that which is good
[1:13:34] because no man want to be found guilty
[1:13:36] of holding to the wrong thing to hold to
[1:13:39] the right thing and hold it
[1:13:42] fast amen amen amen it don't say Pastor
[1:13:46] oh I don't mean it I'm very sorry I
[1:13:48] thought I was right oh I my I'm very
[1:13:52] sorry about it I should have done that
[1:13:54] please forgive me can you pray with me
[1:13:56] pray for me that is repentance amen
[1:13:59] sorrow for sin amen but it's so bad
[1:14:02] today many of times you know both ladies
[1:14:05] and ministers and you know officers in
[1:14:08] church they don't even know what it
[1:14:09] means to repent but the Disciples of
[1:14:12] that day they taught repentance and they
[1:14:14] taught water baptism in the name of
[1:14:16] Jesus Christ they taught Divine Healing
[1:14:19] and it will be going on every day in the
[1:14:22] church right praise God
[1:14:25] but it's so bad sometime the pastor will
[1:14:27] make a call across the sister brother
[1:14:30] see Church you see church he said oh
[1:14:34] Pastor in fact I woke up have a very bad
[1:14:36] day and a bad morning and I got so sick
[1:14:39] and my ache my back ache and this and
[1:14:41] that so well I just couldn't come to
[1:14:44] church that is why I couldn't come to
[1:14:46] church does it mean that there's no Bing
[1:14:50] Gan what is the first place of call
[1:14:54] praise God what did the Bible said is
[1:14:57] there any sick among you let call to the
[1:15:00] of the church let them anoint him with
[1:15:02] oil right and the prayer of the Saints
[1:15:06] the righteous man much even if SE God is
[1:15:10] able to raise him
[1:15:13] up praise God he will make excuses not
[1:15:17] to come to church but yet he will go to
[1:15:18] the hospital on Monday to go and consult
[1:15:20] a doctor where he will pay for
[1:15:22] consultation fee and he will pay for
[1:15:25] everything he will pay for the
[1:15:26] prescription he will pay for the drug
[1:15:29] amen and then he will pay with pain for
[1:15:32] the injections Hallelujah but here in
[1:15:34] church is without money without
[1:15:37] price whosoever will let him
[1:15:42] come Hallelujah because Divine Healing
[1:15:45] still remain in the church so the ear
[1:15:48] Christian disciple they Tau Divine
[1:15:50] Healing they taugh the resurrection of
[1:15:52] the Dead I love that
[1:15:55] because sometime this is tough when you

[1:22:47] couldn't find God he look at it he look
[1:22:50] at every Mis prophecy no answer to to s

[2:12:43] for the god of today the present tense
[2:12:45] sh actively pres is difficult to believe
[2:12:49] that amen amen
[2:12:52] praise God Amen just because we don't
[2:12:54] have confidence in the pastor in the
[2:12:57] ministry God put on us praise God we
[2:13:00] want to debate want to argue with that
[2:13:02] Ministry praise God wanted to see that
[2:13:04] how we can polish the ministry to fit
[2:13:06] our own ways but but God never sent to
[2:13:09] PO the ministry he sent you to believe
[2:13:13] on that
[2:13:14] Ministry praise God and if you believe
[2:13:17] all these are possible if you believe in
[2:13:20] the that God put here you will see
[2:13:23] Miracle among you you will see
[2:13:26] Supernatural among you you will see

[2:13:41] can't get warm with what did yeah praise
[2:13:44] God that's a god of yesterday yeah
[2:13:46] praise God but he must lift him out of
[2:13:49] History are you feel you must raise him

[2:13:54] men he still sending men he's giv them
[2:13:57] different measures oh praise God his
[2:13:59] presence in the church to bless the
[2:14:01] people and the fivefold ministry is
[2:14:04] God's love gift to the

[2:14:11] Hallelujah is to reject God's gift to
[2:14:13] you amen praise God am oh my let me take
[2:14:17] a quote before we
[2:14:19] go let's see what the the Bible is
[2:14:21] saying here and what the prophet said in
[2:14:24] in Revelation 3:2 let's see what he said
[2:14:27] there uh it said now Be watchful and
[2:14:31] stren the things which remain that are
[2:14:34] heing to die for I have not found thy
[2:14:37] works perfect before God now was exing
[2:14:41] scripture in the church age there he
[2:14:43] said Be watchful amen as Straten the
[2:14:48] things which remained that are ready to
[2:14:51] die it said now the idea expressed in
[2:14:54] the two words watchful and certain amen
[2:14:58] at this to wash contains not only the
[2:15:02] idea of being awake but to be
[2:15:07] alert amen aler against any kind form of
[2:15:12] false doctrines alert against any form
[2:15:15] of false idea AER against every greet or
[2:15:18] dogmas aler because only 33 years the
[2:15:22] early CH left the faith Hallelujah and
[2:15:26] today we have promised that this last
[2:15:29] day many will left the faith and we get
[2:15:31] into seducing spirit and doctrines of

[2:16:05] God has called you to an individual God
[2:16:07] deal with the church as an individual

[2:16:11] individual he has no Bishop over him
[2:16:13] amen he has no other head over him his
[2:16:16] headship is the Holy Spirit and his
[2:16:18] headship is not on Earth is in heaven
[2:16:21] amen amen praise be to God Hallelujah
[2:16:25] with all form of idea and organization
[2:16:27] and so forth praise God
[2:16:30] now uh is saying here is said what awake
[2:16:34] amen not only being awake but to be
[2:16:37] alert see to be otherwise inated dangers
[2:16:42] and
[2:16:44] losses it to strengthen means more than
[2:16:47] just to give strength it means to fix
[2:16:51] and establish it for
[2:16:53] permanency Hallelujah get the message
[2:16:57] yes sir contend with it debate for IT

[2:17:28] much Pastor is doing this too much but
[2:17:31] they don't know that the pastor is not
[2:17:32] dealing with the people he only dealing

[2:17:37] of the age are you following church amen
[2:17:41] so establ for permanen see the two words

[2:17:54] die about to die with so many argument
[2:17:57] of the add this and take this off this
[2:18:01] idea and that idea praise God Amen but
