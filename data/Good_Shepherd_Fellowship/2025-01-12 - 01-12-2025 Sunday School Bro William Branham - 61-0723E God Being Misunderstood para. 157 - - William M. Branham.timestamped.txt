[2:42] 106 and the 7th verse I was going to
[2:45] read on down a piece a part of this
[2:48] Psalm but it's David why come to me was
[2:51] because of this morning's message and
[2:53] now get my Watcher and try to be out at
[2:56] 9:30 if all possible now on the 7th bir
[2:59] verse of Psalms
[3:01] 106 our fathers understood not thy
[3:05] wonders in
[3:07] Egypt they remembered not the multitude
[3:11] of thy mercies but provoked him at the
[3:15] sea even the Red Sea I'm going to read
[3:19] the next verse nevertheless he saved
[3:22] them for his name's sake that he might
[3:25] make his mighty power to be known
[3:30] the Lord had his blessings I'm going to
[3:33] speak to you if the Lord willing on the
[3:36] subject
[3:38] of the
[3:41] misunderstanding God
[3:44] misunderstood I'll take it like that God
[3:47] being
[3:48] misunderstood
[3:51] amen you know misunderstanding gets us
[3:54] in a lot of
[3:57] trouble many times that people say
[3:59] things that
[4:01] they uh repeat after somebody else where
[4:03] they misunderstood them
[4:05] amen that gets a person in trouble I
[4:09] believe it would be good for us if we
[4:11] just F wait till we understood what we
[4:13] was talking about don't you think so I
[4:15] know it would be for me a very good for
[4:17] me to find out first and then say it but
[4:20] we're always seem to be
[4:23] misunderstood and here David is speaking
[4:26] of Israel misunderstood his miracles
[4:32] when they were in Egypt now to
[4:34] misunderstand is just not say well I
[4:37] didn't hear what he said but to see
[4:39] something done and misunderstand what
[4:42] it's for that's a that's you're missing
[4:44] the boot all completely
[4:46] then now God doesn't do Miracles just to
[4:49] say see I'm God God does a miracle for
[4:53] an
[4:54] understanding he God does it for a
[4:58] purpose and did you know notice the
[5:00] reading of the Psalms here in this
[5:02] seventh verse I think it's so beautiful
[5:05] I want to read it over again our fathers
[5:09] understood not thy wonders in Egypt see
[5:13] they didn't understand it they
[5:15] remembered not the multitude of thy
[5:18] mercies but provoked him at the sea even
[5:21] the Red Sea nevertheless he save them
[5:24] for his name's sake that he might make
[5:28] his mighty power to be known he see they
[5:32] did not
[5:34] understand why that God down in Egypt
[5:37] perform these
[5:40] Miracles he was trying to show them his
[5:44] mercies amen he was trying to get them
[5:48] to understand that he was God in their
[5:52] midst I love that in my little sermon
[5:56] that I preached here sometime ago uh up
[5:59] and Chicago and then I believe I
[6:00] preached it here the boys has got it on
[6:03] tape as the eagle stirreth up her nest
[6:06] floth over her young how that the old
[6:10] mother eagle takes her little babies
[6:13] before she takes them on a flight they
[6:15] got a lot of loose feathers in them and
[6:18] they've never seen her really in her V
[6:20] because they're all squatted down in the
[6:23] nest but she gets up over the nest and
[6:26] she spreads her big Mighty Wings
[6:30] what's she doing she
[6:32] screams she wants him to know her
[6:35] voice she stretches forth her big wings
[6:38] the female eagle is sometimes the
[6:41] largest they are said that Eagles
[6:43] sometime that big females has wings 14
[6:47] ft from tip to tip pick up a calf and
[6:50] fly away with
[6:51] it 14 ft tip from tip to Wings far as
[6:55] across this platform right here from
[6:57] post to post she gets up there before
[6:59] this little fell because why she's going
[7:02] to take him on a flight he's never been
[7:05] out of that nest and she's going to take
[7:07] him way up in the heavens and Shake him
[7:09] off and let him up there to flop for
[7:12] himself to learn how to fly so she wants
[7:15] to show The Authority she has she
[7:18] spreads forth her big wings to the stut
[7:21] of the feathers and she screams and then
[7:24] she fans them oh my the feathers fly out
[7:28] the this and everything everything else
[7:30] she's throwing wind in there like of a
[7:32] Jet Plane knocks him backwards and he
[7:34] lays on his little back and looks up and
[7:37] think mother How Great Thou Art How
[7:41] Great Thou Art see how strong my wings
[7:43] are I can pick you up and pack you
[7:47] anywhere I want to I'm powerful that's
[7:51] what God was doing to
[7:53] Israel you know what he said as the
[7:54] eagle stir up her nest that's the same
[7:56] thing he found Israel in a howling land
[7:59] land down there and he brought him up
[8:01] out of Egypt and Tuck him into the
[8:03] promised land on the wings of an
[8:05] eagle see and what was God doing these
[8:09] Miracles he was trying to get to his
[8:12] people that he was the mighty Jehovah
[8:16] Hallelujah and that's what he's trying
[8:18] to do today amen he just doesn't heal
[8:22] people just to because he can heal he's
[8:25] trying to get to you that he's the
[8:27] resurrection
[8:29] he can make you well he can raise up
[8:31] your body he can do whatever he wants to
[8:34] he's
[8:34] Jehovah I like that but the people
[8:39] misunderstood
[8:40] him God is so easily to be misunderstood
[8:44] by unbelievers for those who don't want
[8:46] to understand many people try to
[8:49] understand many don't want to understand
[8:52] they just shut up themselves and say
[8:54] there's no such a thing and I don't
[8:55] believe in such then they can never
[8:58] understand but a man that that's willing
[9:00] to understand that's willing to sit down
[9:02] and come let us reason together say the
[9:05] Lord amen now that man is is on the line
[9:09] of learning something from the law but
[9:12] people who always are associated with
[9:16] God and God's power you can hardly be
[9:20] associated with god without being
[9:22] associated with his power because when
[9:25] you're associated with him you are
[9:27] acquainted to him or relative to him and
[9:30] then you have his power in you
[9:33] amen that's the reason that people
[9:35] cannot believe in miracles today because
[9:37] they don't have anything in them to
[9:39] believe with they've got to have
[9:41] something in there to believe with and
[9:43] when the spirit of God is in a man he'll
[9:45] say Amen to every word of God and every
[9:48] miracle of God hallelujah but as my
[9:51] mother used to say you can't get blood
[9:53] from Eternal because there's no blood in
[9:55] it so that's the same way you can't get
[9:57] belief out of an unbeliever because
[9:59] there's nothing there you believe with
[10:01] amen a man said I don't believe in
[10:03] Divine Healing no matter what you say
[10:05] certainly it's not for him it's only to
[10:07] those who can believe praise the Lord if
[10:10] you're going to get blood get it out
[10:11] from something's got blood in it if
[10:14] you're going to get Faith get it out of
[10:15] something that's got faith in it and
[10:17] that's the way God uses something that's
[10:19] got faith in it you go to S you're in a
[10:22] healing campaign when you ain't got
[10:23] faith enough to believe it amen how's he
[10:26] go to send you out in a miracle work in
[10:28] Revival and you ain't got faith enough
[10:29] to believe it he wants something that's
[10:31] got something in there that he can
[10:33] produce something with so the people
[10:36] misunderstood Noah was very much
[10:39] misunderstood in his
[10:41] days Noah acquainted of God a servant of
[10:45] God a believer in God and when youve
[10:49] become a believer in God you do things
[10:51] so contrary to what people think it's
[10:52] right so they think that you're crazy
[10:56] and Noah warned of God prepare an art
[10:59] for the saving of his household and the
[11:01] people thought that he was crazy he was
[11:04] not crazy he was just misunderstood
[11:07] because he was following the direction
[11:09] of God amen amen I like that Hallelujah
[11:13] he was misunderstood How could a man
[11:15] when you'd say there's never no rain
[11:17] come from the skies what is rain never
[11:20] had rain God irrigated the ground no
[11:23] where's that rain at I don't know show
[11:26] me where it's that I can't show it to
[11:28] you well how do you know it's going to
[11:30] come down from up there when there's
[11:31] done up there to come down no one might
[11:33] have said something like this God told
[11:35] me it was coming down and if God said
[11:37] it's coming down he's able to take it up
[11:39] there and then bring it down so that
[11:41] settles it if God said so that's all
[11:43] there is to it see he was misunderstood
[11:46] because he was following
[11:50] God
[11:51] Elijah I can stay on these subjects a
[11:54] long time but I've got several of them
[11:56] here I would like to come to quickly
[11:58] Elijah
[11:59] was misunderstood by his
[12:01] Nation Elijah was an Israelite he was a
[12:06] Jew and he was uh misunderstood because
[12:10] he was always condemning his Nation
[12:13] condemning the king condemning the queen
[12:17] condemning everything there was around
[12:19] him condemning him what a crackpot he
[12:22] seemed to be well my everything you King
[12:26] th sayth the Lord God's going to punish
[12:29] you Jezebel you so and so he was
[12:33] misunderstood why he was following God
[12:37] it was not Elijah they misunderstood it
[12:40] was the working of the holy spirit in
[12:44] that they
[12:45] misunderstood How could a man raise up
[12:47] against his own Nation blaspheme his own
[12:50] Nation correct it and put the curses of
[12:52] God up on it the very Nation the very
[12:55] people that he lived with his own race
[12:57] his own color his own Creed his own kind
[13:01] and yet predict the judgments of God and
[13:03] call a famine upon Him amen he was
[13:07] misunderstood because it wasn't Elijah
[13:10] it was God in Elijah that they
[13:12] misunderstood it wasn't Elijah being
[13:14] misunderstood it was God leading Elijah
[13:18] and they misunderstood that God was a
[13:21] holy God and he canot en tolerate sin no
[13:25] matter if it's on your brother sister or
[13:27] mother no matter who it is that sin in
[13:30] the sight of God and the judgment will
[13:32] come upon him for amen
[13:36] misunderstood Daniel was
[13:39] misunderstood when all of the rest of
[13:41] the children of Israel bowed down to the
[13:44] image but he and Shadrach and mishak and
[13:47] abedo refused to bow down well they said
[13:51] what's the matter with him the whole
[13:52] nation said what's the matter with this
[13:54] crazy guy well all the rest of the
[13:57] Hebrews recognize our God
[13:59] they recognize that they bow down when
[14:01] we play the trumpets and sound the
[14:03] trumpets and play the posteries and so
[14:05] forth and sound the flutes they all bow
[14:07] down but what's the matter with this
[14:09] crackpot what's the matter with him he
[14:11] won't do it because he was in contact
[14:14] with God that's what the matter he was
[14:18] misunderstood he was supposed to be
[14:20] crazy or lost his mind or there was a
[14:23] bunch of cranks but they were only
[14:26] following the leading of the spirit
[14:29] Hallelujah that's the reason they were
[14:31] misunderstood all the prophets of the
[14:33] Old Testament how they rose up and
[14:36] prophesied against their Nation how they
[14:38] prophesied against the people how they
[14:40] prophesied against the
[14:42] things putting curses up on them and
[14:44] doing things like that they
[14:47] misunderstood why they were God's
[14:50] servants they were doing the will of God
[14:52] they were doing the service of God
[14:54] therefore they were misunderstood and
[14:56] anybody that follows God is
[14:58] misunderstood amen Jesus our lord when
[15:02] his birth he was
[15:05] misunderstood the
[15:07] mag they were
[15:09] misunderstood they were following a
[15:11] supernatural
[15:12] sign to find a king that was born King
[15:17] of the
[15:18] Jews they know there was a star rising
[15:21] out of Jacob according to the Prophecies
[15:24] of Daniel and they know this king would
[15:27] be a savior
[15:29] he would be the king of Israel and they
[15:32] come two years all the way from India
[15:36] down by the Titus River and across the
[15:38] deserts and through the mountains
[15:40] everywhere and come into the city of
[15:42] Jerusalem one evening about Sundown
[15:44] screaming where is he that's born King
[15:46] of the
[15:47] Jews where is he and nobody know nothing
[15:51] about it it was a strange thing that the
[15:54] king of the Jews was born and people
[15:56] hundreds of miles away not about it T
[15:59] not you're in the city where he was born
[16:00] and the place he was born and what's the
[16:02] people he was born to and they know
[16:04] nothing about
[16:05] it Hallelujah they misunderstood the
[16:08] Magi they said there is no such a thing
[16:10] as the king of the Jews we got a king up
[16:12] here
[16:13] Herod he was
[16:16] misunderstood in his birth when he was
[16:18] born and married was to be mother before
[16:21] she was uh married to Joseph
[16:25] misunderstood they thought it was born
[16:27] out a holy wed they did not know that
[16:29] the Holy Ghost had conceived this child
[16:32] here but it was misunderstood it was the
[16:34] act of God and people misunderstood it
[16:37] they still misunderstand it amen an act
[16:40] of God is usually misunderstood only by
[16:44] spiritual believing people people who
[16:46] bleed the spirit but it was
[16:48] misunderstood the Magi was
[16:51] misunderstood Herod misunderstood it
[16:54] when Herod said well you tell me where
[16:56] the baby is and I'll will worship him
[16:59] too he was a hypocrite he was a lion
[17:03] while he was sprayed up he didn't know
[17:05] the scriptures that they were supposed
[17:06] to be a messiah come a king of heaven
[17:10] and Herod thought it would be an Earthly
[17:12] King and he wanted to kill him to get
[17:14] rid of him it wasn't an Earthly King he
[17:17] said this Earth is not his King this was
[17:19] my kingdom my subjects would fight for
[17:21] me but my kingdom is of above Herod
[17:24] misunderstood it he thought it was an
[17:25] Earthly king that's why they say they
[17:28] what church you belong to if you're a
[17:29] Christian what denomination
[17:32] none they don't get
[17:35] it see they can't understand it they
[17:39] think a denomination means a Christian
[17:41] it's
[17:42] Vice
[17:45] Hallelujah very much so but it's
[17:47] misunderstood by the people
[17:50] now we find out that Herod misunderstood
[17:53] it he couldn't understand it Nicodemus
[17:55] couldn't understand it the New Birth
[17:58] when he came came to Jesus by night
[18:00] someone condemned him I don't condemn
[18:02] him he's a good man you want to find out
[18:05] something he was busy few today maybe is
[18:08] at his priest's office there something
[18:10] that he had to come tonight anyhow he
[18:12] got there he done a lot better than a
[18:13] lot of people does now they won't come
[18:15] day our night he finally arrived before
[18:17] you condemn him have you he finally got
[18:20] to Jesus and let's not condemn him if we
[18:22] haven't been there if you get there then
[18:24] I don't think you condemn him oh he he
[18:27] got there and he but night maybe he was
[18:29] busy anyhow he come maybe Jesus is too
[18:32] busy out praying for the sick and think
[18:34] only time he could catch him for this
[18:35] interview would be at night time but he
[18:37] finally got there he stayed there
[18:38] because he got an interview with Jesus
[18:41] and when Jesus said him he said Rabbi we
[18:43] know that you are a man sent from God
[18:46] for no man could do these things that
[18:48] you do except God be with him Jesus said
[18:51] except the man be born again he cannot
[18:53] enter the kingdom not even see the
[18:55] kingdom and the great rabbi master in
[19:00] Israel said me an old man enter into my
[19:04] mother's wombs and be bned against it he
[19:07] misunderstood what Jesus is talking
[19:09] about am he just didn't get it because
[19:13] that Jesus was talking about a spiritual
[19:15] birth and he was trying to apply it to a
[19:18] national birth so he misunderstood him
[19:21] he didn't get it he just way people do
[19:24] just like Nicodemus many of us
[19:26] misunderstand the things of God because
[19:29] we just take it and apply it for a
[19:31] natural thing like say a doctor say oh I
[19:33] do not believe in Divine Healing I don't
[19:35] believe there's anything I heard a
[19:36] doctor tell a woman in an office one
[19:38] time said and she didn't know they want
[19:41] know what become of a girl she had she
[19:43] said brother Brandon prayed for me and
[19:45] Lord Heal me he said I do not believe it
[19:49] he said I can never I can never believe
[19:51] anything like that said tell me who took
[19:53] it all said find the
[19:55] scar said what did you put on it said
[19:58] nothing not at
[20:00] all said he just called me out of the
[20:02] meeting and the thing left now sitting
[20:04] right in the Next
[20:05] Room right sitting right in the next
[20:07] room listening she didn't know I was in
[20:09] there he didn't know I was in there cuz
[20:10] he didn't even know me see and there I
[20:12] was sitting in there and he said taking
[20:14] somebody else to a doctor's office it's
[20:16] exactly right I want to hear what he
[20:18] said I got I got the patient he got out
[20:20] of there when I found that that he
[20:22] didn't believe so he said I don't
[20:23] believe one word of it said I've never
[20:25] seen anything yet that could do anything
[20:27] like that I just don't believe it said
[20:29] I've got to see it before I believe it
[20:31] she said well what about my my growth he
[20:34] said I have to see it leave before I
[20:36] believe it see seeing is not
[20:38] believing faith is the substance of
[20:41] things you don't see see you believe at
[20:44] first and then it happen so the the man
[20:47] was not a Believer so therefore it was
[20:49] all a mystery to him he didn't know what
[20:51] he was talking about because he he
[20:53] couldn't understand it it was a riddle
[20:55] to him people say today oh I don't
[20:57] believe in that divine heing I don't
[20:59] believe in that Holy Ghost I don't
[21:00] believe in that speaking in tongues I
[21:01] don't believe in that shouting I don't
[21:03] believe in all this stuff like that I
[21:05] don't believe in it why it's a mystery
[21:06] you're just misunderstanding it's God
[21:08] here it is in the Bible here it is
[21:11] bringing the same results that the Bible
[21:13] spoke of bringing and it's got to be God
[21:15] you just misunderstand it that's all God
[21:18] is
[21:19] misunderstood his disciples couldn't
[21:22] understand his marle that night when he
[21:23] come into the boat and he said what
[21:26] manner of man is this that even the
[21:28] winds and the waves
[21:30] obey they misunderstood that he wasn't a
[21:34] man he was God Amen that's what's matter
[21:38] today people they want to make him a
[21:40] little mascot boy or something another
[21:43] uh cares that they want to make him a a
[21:46] just a a little fellow around the camp
[21:49] he wasn't a little fellow around the
[21:50] camp he was Jehovah God Amen they
[21:55] misunderstood it they expected him to be
[21:57] just one of them he wasn't one of them
[22:00] he was God among them he was more than a
[22:03] man I've often said he was a man when he
[22:06] was hungry but he was God when he fed
[22:08] 5,000 with a biscuit two biscuits and
[22:10] some pieces of fishes he was a man when
[22:13] he was tired on the back of the boat but
[22:15] he was God when he ceased the winds and
[22:18] waves and made him obeying amen what
[22:20] manner of man is this he wasn't a manner
[22:22] of a man he was God manifested in a man
[22:26] Hallelujah they misunderstood him they
[22:28] thought him to be a man Mary son a
[22:30] carpenter but he was God manifested In
[22:33] the Flesh amen hallelujah the Roman
[22:36] soldiers misunderstood him when they had
[22:38] him sit in the court and put a rag
[22:40] around his eyes and hit him on top of
[22:42] the head and said now if you are a
[22:44] prophet they all say you're a Prophet
[22:46] come and tell us who hit you on top of
[22:48] the head see they misunderstood that
[22:51] Jesus said I do only what the father
[22:53] shows me to do I do what the father
[22:56] shows me then I do what he tells me to
[22:58] do they misunderstood it they
[23:00] misunderstood his ministry amen the Jews
[23:03] misunderstood him how he come to be
