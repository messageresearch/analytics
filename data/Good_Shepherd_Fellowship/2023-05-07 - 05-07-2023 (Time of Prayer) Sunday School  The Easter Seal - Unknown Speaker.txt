[Music] foreign [Music] now if that mother would have screamed like a a buzzard he'd never notice he'd been just as well off in the barnyard but it was a scream of an eagle there was something inside that little fella that he knowed he was an eagle and the same thing is with every True Believer when the preaching of God's word comes forth and is Vindicated and proved that it's God's word for this hour then there's something within the believer I don't care how long his father was to a church or how loyal his mother was or his grandparents and if that church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost message there's something in him that screams out he'll lead the barnyard he's got to do it the chicken might have been all right one day but this is Eagle hour see it's a different it's something that he must leave the old cook and fly away Into the Blue then this Earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to The Obedience of God's word now when this Holy Spirit represented as the eagle flying over the land and finds the believer no man can come to me no man can come to me as he wants to all the father has given me will come to me but no man can come by himself it isn't your own thinking your own drawing it's God drawing see all the father has given me will come to me now the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on Jesus Christ the great super Son of God you redeem this all it comes down and takes this place of Abode into the human life now notice brought the quickest power now that quickening power that come upon Jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day if it's not a mockery Holy Spirit it was not the devil mocking the Holy Spirit but is the real true Holy Spirit it'll manifest the promise of this hour when a fell upon Luther it manifested that promise of that hour when it fell upon Wesley it manifested the promise of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour one of fell upon Moses it manifested the promise of that hour fell upon Noah it manifests the promise of that hour when it fell Upon Jesus it manifests the promise of that hour see it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive those people that's foreordained of God to be in the rapture you know that is if he is a true Eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true Eagle now the little Eagle problem in the barnyard was eating all right but he you know what it was just exactly right but then when he heard the truth then he received this truth now in John 14 uh John 5 24 rather Jesus said speaking this way he that heareth my words and believeth on him that set me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the Judgment but pass from Death unto life just think how simple it is he that believer now the correct way of saying that he that understandeth now you go out you're on the street and say to this prostitute you believe sure you believe the Son of God certainly been baptized your breath or drunkard say you hear that hear that preacher preach yeah you believe that sure see but he that understandeth he that nor this place in this hour he either heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life shall not come into judgment but it's already passed from Death unto then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnestness of you being quickened from Mortal to immortality let me say it again when this spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your Eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential I if you ask me for an oak tree and I'll give you an acre now the the life for the oak tree is in the acorn now but you have to wait till it grows up so do we when you receive the holy spirit of God it's God's potential waiting upon you that's already recognized you and you're sealed by the spirit of Promise of God into the body of Christ and when God looked down at Calvary and seen Jesus dying he not or he died for his bride the body which is the word church the church that believes the word of God for the age with his feet body head or wherever it is see it's Christ was bleeding and dying God looking upon Him saw his resurrection and the church raised with him on Easter now I want you to get all this together because I got something here a little bit I want to say the Lord buddy now notice it's the earnest are the potential the quickening power of your Resurrection when you receive the holy spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it notice you you are now on your way growing to the full Resurrection no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in the grace and knowledge of God you are baptized into the Holy Spirit now as the Pentecostal Church baptized into the holy spirit is to begin growing limbs as dies is pruning them all but the tree's still growing is still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection they're led by the spirit to Quicken the word to you who is Believers the word keeps quickness come the first limbs secondly and third limb or if it just keeps quickening the spirit of God keeps creating until you notice that Pentecost their bodies were quickened by the new life they received that makes me feel religious think now here was man fishermen tax collectors The Humble Little Women other just ordinary Housewives little virgin girls they were believers they were believing that this was the truth they believed that when Jesus died they believed on him and Rose up again from the dead they believed that to be the absolutely testimony of God that he had quickened him to life now they go up to the day of Pentecost to receive their abstract you know what an abstract is it's when a Deeds been cleared they went up there to received their abstract and they become quickened or what a thrill that bought the land been bought for him they had received it is it true or not we seen him raise up but now what about us we Are Witnesses we stood and seen the man crucified we've seen the clouds come over the Earth and darken the skies and the the Earth quaked and Shook and had nervous prostration then when they put him in the grave they speared him in the heart with the spear and he took his body down and laid into the grave of Joseph from Armenia and then they'd find out that on the third day he raised up again and as the disciples said we Are Witnesses of this we've seen him raise up we know he's alive now what did that do that took all the fear out no wonder Jesus said fear not I'm he that was dead and is Alive forevermore you're taking all the fear out when they did that now but when they went up to Pentecost there they received the quickening power the power that made them alive now there's where I think of you Presbyterian Methodist brother you do receive potentially On Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ but the abstract hasn't come yet that's the clearing of the deed God gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision and God gives you a promise potentially that you will receive it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end time but you see you have to get a clearance on that beat and the clearance is when everything against it has been stricken off and you got the abstract to it you've got the seal it's yours everything's on it belongs to you amen and when we believe on Jesus Christ for our savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believing God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract and the abstract is the Assurance it's the guarantee that everything was ever held against you you was thoroughly repented Hallelujah and the property is Bolton and you hold the abstract for the Assurance let somebody try to put you off the land say he belongs in your lips tracking your hand let him try to do the law in the land can do it because you hold the abstract and there's no devil no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and Abstract that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus Christ we're just sure to raise us he reads because potentially we have already raised in him in the old things what does it do to our moral bodies turns our opinions changes our Notions it sets our affections on things which are above and the smoking drinking Cannon the things that she used to do is beneath you and you are quickened in this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already notice the Pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit listen to me when those Pentecostal group up there on the day of Pentecost receive their abstract Deed from God shuri glorified their souls they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it's so quick in their body until they couldn't even speak in an Earthly language anymore it quickened their body to Heavenly language the place they're going to quickening power of God shook their mortal bodies so tiller into our mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language what a quickening power what's something it belongs if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it shall also Quicken your Immortal body we are quicker than thou the power of the Living God tongues quicker to a new Heavenly language to speak to them a rapturing up raising up into a different atmosphere than what they'd ever lived in also with the new quickening life to them that come in them it quickened their language they spoke in new tongues oh yes now watch it um it also was designed to give them add to this abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds every promise on the grounds of God's word that was promised in the Bible that quickening power was given to them to Quicken that promise to them therefore they laid hands on the sick they were sealed they spoke in new tongues they've done great signs and wonders because that was in God's promise and when Jesus died to redeem that back to them the grounds that belonged to sons of God he demonstrated what God was how dare we to socialize that and put it into an organization we have no rights to do that it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer and when you accept it in his fullness and God knows that you'll do it he gives you the abstract to that and that every promise is made is in your possession and the holy spirit's there to Quicken that to you thank you people should we be how wonderful to see that God's Great Holy Spirit you're to do that power think of it when the Holy Ghost itself hear the bare record of this hour Jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out The Works that I do shall you do also John 14 12. these signs shall follow them that believe that is their shorts when we see a group of people signs men themselves that's the assurance that the abstract desire to vindicate that that's property of God amen you're awesome hey man we are now in our Easter we've already raised Hallelujah from the things of the world to the things of God's promise amen not we will we are potentials is God's promise he'd priority spirit in the last days and that's what they would do notice laid their hands on the sick everything that was in God's promise I should pour out my spirit in the last days upon All Flesh your old man shall dream dreams your young man shall see visions and all these different promises that he made everything's laying right there in God's promise Jesus redeemed it to us and when we become or we if we are ordained on that ground if we are ordained to be on that ground like the eagle walk into the chicken's nest if you're our date on that ground the holy spirit is sure to find you and when it finds you you recognize this call you know the hour you're living you know what these things are supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meeting and now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh what a promise what a heavenly father who would give us these things the spirit quickens their fellowship with God so that they call the dead back to life in that day they laid their bodies upon the dead they come to life listen closely they've done the same things that Jesus did because the Same Spirit was upon him was upon them if one spirit makes a man act this way it makes the other an act that way if how can this come upon say he's got the spirit of God and deny the works of God cannot do it notice God's life which is in the Greek called Zoe moving through them and in them Quicken their minds to his word now let me say it real quietly huh the spirit of God that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of God see it does it listen I'm trying to show you the the let you realize that I'm speaking out of the church and also Quicken to life in him although they only uh or was his attributes to begin with but if God said in this day back in the beginning John Doe will be my servant millions of years ago now John goes born in sin shaped in iniquity comes the world speaking lies because he's immortal but maybe he gets a little religious feeling he'll go jar of church maybe you'll join Pentecostal Church he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of God once see John Doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that eagle recognized who the mother was it's got to realize it see only that John Doe is God's attribute that's become a word spoken and then the Holy Spirit seeks that word out here it is he calls it gives him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of God God's word look God had the same when he saw Jesus it was it was a finished work that God finished with Jesus when he said it's finished all the plan was finished and when the spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes that he's spoken of now if you're not you'll wander and fluster it and run here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth if you are one of those the old things pass away right quick see and you become new and low Plan of Salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you see for you to do you're submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off and as it was at the day of Pentecost now let us notice the quickly this quickening Spirit on other people now I told you I wouldn't speak very long and I just got 20 minutes to keep my word if I do that notice the keeper one time I said about about an hour notice now this quickening power that only comes now there's a lot of mockery of it there's a lot of people I really think they got it a lot of people do it because they have got some false impression of what they've seen other Christians do Satan can impersonate any of that we know that it is missionaries you can see it impersonated shouting dancing speaking in tongues all these things you can stand impersonated anywhere absolutely amongst heathens the people who deny there is a such a thing as Jesus Christ be the Son of God see and they do all those things themselves but the real true quickening spirit that comes to believer quickens into God's word that's back to Eagle food again right back to where he lives man shall not live by bread alone by by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God let us now notice this quickening Spirit as they come upon other people like it did on on the day of Pentecost let's notice Pinnacles how they acted [Music] [Music] [Music]
