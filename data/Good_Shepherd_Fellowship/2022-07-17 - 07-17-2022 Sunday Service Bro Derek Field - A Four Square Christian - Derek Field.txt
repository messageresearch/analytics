nice to see you you may take your seats and thank you musicians uh some of you folks know that i was i was here on wednesday night we had some visitors um who were traveling through some very good friends who uh usually we we go to uh the the uh grace ministries in hopkins but i thought it's nice to have fellowship with believers from everywhere so i wanted to introduce them to you folks up here and so i uh i brought them along and rachel said to me yeah but what if what if they ask you to preach you're like well okay if they asked me to preach i i and and as i was driving up i was i just getting this these thoughts about this um this message that i'm going to preach today and i was like oh boy so i i sat in the back with my kids and every time the door opened i was all kind of nervous that would be someone being like brother terry you wanted to preach and it's like okay and then brother dan preached and i was like wow what a blessing you know it's nice to come and to be blessed by someone else ministering and that was a really good service i've really enjoyed it what a blessing to have his ministry here it's like ah that's good and so i left and the next day and i knew brother one had gone to to to liberia and the next day he called me he's like uh yeah it's funny i was going to call you and ask you to preach on on sunday so here i am again so we're trusting that the lord will bless us today despite the weaknesses and the the issues that we have we rely on him so uh so i want to uh i want to ask you to stand with me and and we'll start in ephesians chapter 2 and then we'll go to revelations chapter 20 one and uh lord willing we'll get a little something that will encourage us that will bring us a step closer to god that will help us in our walk in this life so in ephesians uh chapter 22 uh sorry in ephesians chapter 2 verse 11 to 22 therefore remember that ye being in times past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenant of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who were sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and that broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in the ordinance for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the flesh having slain the enmity thereof and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that when i for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye are also building together for an inhabitation of god through the spirit amen wonderful wonderful scripture let's just turn to uh revelations 21 we'll just take one verse there and it says in verse 16 and the city lieth four square let's pray heavenly father we pray you be with us today we pray you'd speak to us we pray that something would bring us one step closer to you that there'd be encouragement for somebody that there would be correction for somebody that there would be new life for somebody lord for we've been built into your image into a dwelling place for you may today lord a few more bricks be laid may today our foundations be made more secure may today something happen that we could be a more suitable dwelling place for you we ask in jesus name amen you may take your seats okay and so today i would like to talk about four square okay four square we are we we are going to a city that's four square what does that mean what does it mean to be four square well we're going to have a little look in the scripture and we're going to find out that four square is the meeting place of god and man it's where god and man come together because that word foursquare you can find it in the bible in the new testament associated with the the new jerusalem that comes down and the new jerusalem is the bride john says that okay and so the bride is the people of god the dwelling place of god and you can find that same word foursquare in the old testament and you know in the old testament that word in hebrew is only associated with the tabernacle in the temple it's associated with the tabernacle of moses it's associated and describes the temple of solomon and it's associated and it describes the temple that ezekiel saw so it's a special place a word for a special place a word for dwelling together with god four square and so today i want us to be not denominational foursquare church okay they're still here they're still ministering they're still bringing people closer to jesus and we should support anybody that is bringing people one step closer to jesus amen we don't want to say anything bad about anyone if they can get people one step closer to jesus because if you can get people one step closer to the lord jesus you're getting them one step closer to life and who cares how that comes about amen we should support you know those jehovah witnesses that go around those mormons that go around those people that go around they they speak the name of jesus to people may the lord bless them okay we can disagree with them on on little bits and pieces but if they can reach someone and start them on a trail to bring them to jesus that's a wonderful thing amen and so we don't want to be denominational foursquare but today i want us to consider being a little more four square christians and i'm going to show you what that means in the scripture to be a four squares christian because we're being built into the dwelling place of god and i want to ask you this morning where are you on this journey where are you and what's your next step what's the next thing that god is building in your life how is god constructing you to be a more effective christian to be a better dwelling place you know it's wonderful to come here and and um and and see the difference in the church you see uh and and when i first came here you had if i recall correctly you had a little tile entryway and then you had carpet and then you had tile in the back in the entryway it was something like that yeah and now you've got that really nice laminate floor it looks so nice okay yeah and and uh this this area you've you've taken down the the little pasta room at the back and moved it and and it's a more comfortable place and there's more space for people on the inside and there's a continual growing and a continual changing to make it better more suitable for purpose and you're the dwelling place of god and god is constantly changing you and changing a little bit here and a little bit there maybe putting up a fresh coat of paint but why to make you a better dwelling place for him that's what we want to be today is a better dwelling place for him and so i want to talk about that that way that god progresses through our lives the and it's the same way that god progresses through the salvation of a soul is the same way it's he works in the same pattern for the salvation of israel he works in the same pattern for the the redemption of the whole world okay that tabernacle we're going to look at foursquare we're going to ask ourselves where are we at in our journey with god and there's always a place where we can improve but we're going to start with the first uh if if you go into the tabernacle and the first thing that you would see in the wilderness was that fence surrounding the tabernacle and you would go into the gate and right before you what was there somebody just want to make sure you're awake what was the first thing in the tabernacle as you went in through the gates the it was the brass altar it was the altar of burnt offering okay so let's have a look at that that's in exodus chapter 27 we're going to look at this and this is the first thing that you would see that was four square all right 27.1 now shall make an altar of and woot five cubits long and five cubits brought the altar shall be four square and the height thereof shall be three cubits and so that four square four square is the meeting place between god and man okay how many know what a cuba is okay a cubit is a space between your elbow and the end of your fingers so it's about a foot and a half okay so that's a cubit and so this is five cubits long all right so it's about seven and a half feet long it's it's bigger than my arm i'm quite a big person and you know it's bigger than my wingspan is all right and it's three cubits high and it's the first meeting place between god and man and what's it there for it's there to provide the place for atonement from sin it's there that people would bring in their sacrifices their offerings it would that would be that would be killed and the blood would be poured out and sprinkled on the altar and the offering would be laid on the altar and the fumes of it would go up to heaven it was brass covered in wood and wood speaks of humanity and that brass speaks of judgment and so it's the place where we come and you can't come to god without coming to the place of judgment first without coming to the place of sacrifice first without coming to that place where you lay down your life and you say i've got nothing to give you i have to die to myself and take on i have to claim that i can't go any further in my relationship with god except by the blood of a sacrifice okay i can't claim sin uh forgiveness for myself except by the blood of a sacrifice and that sacrifices jesus christ for us we don't have to bring an ox or a lamb to the to the tabernacle every day but we do have to die daily we do have to bring the sacrifice of jesus christ every day you see don't forget this is justification but this has to happen every day in our lives okay what's god dealing with you is he dealing with you on some sin that you haven't died to self yet that you haven't covered with the blood of jesus christ i guarantee that he's dealing with that with something in your life so and and when he's dealing with that with you you won't be able to go any further until you've got past the altar of sacrifice that first meeting place of god and man and you know some people they get to the altar of sacrifice and they sacrifice and they're justified and then they turn around and they leave and they don't go any deeper and you know what that's fine that's fine everybody that their people are called to different places in god's economy okay and and the bible says that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved okay i believe there's a lot more people saved than we would think you know why because i've said it before and i'll say it again because i believe it god loves life and the bible tells us he's not willing that the sinner perish so he's going to bring whoever he can into life by whatever means he can okay oh god bless him there's there's a brother in africa zimbabwe god went to cindy i don't know if any of you have ever met him you've met brother godwin that's wonderful his testimony was he was traveling to become to terrorist training uh yeah when when the uh british controlled or the the white folks controlled rhodesia before it became zimbabwe and so there were terrorist cells trying to overthrow the minority government and he was traveling there and he said he was waiting at the airport there was a tent he didn't have anything else to do so he went in it was a gospel tent and the preacher was preaching and the preacher said uh is anyone here want to accept jesus and he said well i sat there and i thought i don't have anything against this jesus so he put up his hand okay and his life changed from that moment on you see all right now now he's a brother that's gone on in the lord he didn't just stop at the altar and then walk out again he's a real blessed minister of god all right but you see how simple it is i i was talking um to to a good friend of mine in england andrew wilson and he said he he was he was a uh he did drugs and he did uh he did different things he said then his mother was a was a a uh was a drunk and she drank and she fell down the stairs and they called him and his brother in from the hotel where they were working they said you need to come and see her went to the hospital and the doctor said you know you need to go home and any moment we may be giving you a call to come and spend your last few minutes with your mother and he said he went home and he said uh he and his brother started smoking drugs and he said but he he wasn't getting a high out of it he was just and he said that something he said god take my life and spare my mother's life okay and he was sharing his testimony at that point i said what do you think god because at that point was where he started to become a christian where god start it's like god took him at his word he took his life as a christian spared his mother's life his mother recovered and so it's just in little things like that and how many little things are happening to people you see that we overlook that god says for this i'll bring you into life i can jesus listen jesus owns the whole world he paid for the whole world all right so he can do what he wants with it and so if he wants to save everybody he could do that i actually believe you don't have to accept jesus to be saved you have to reject jesus to be lost okay all right yeah so because otherwise children why how could they be saved because they've never had the chance to accept jesus but they're saved because they never have the chance to reject jesus and so as jesus is working in your life step by step by step make sure you never reject him okay but we want to get beyond the altar of burnt offering you come to the altar for forgiveness of sins but it doesn't do too much for you spiritually you have to go further in but it is the place between life and death but as we pass beyond the altar and we go through and we go to the lava the brass lava where you wash okay a basin of water and then before you is the actual tabernacle the sanctuary and only priests could go in and when the priests went inside there were three pieces of furniture on the inside there was the table of showbread there was the candlestick and there was the altar of incense okay let's read about the altar of incense exodus 30. it says and thou shall make an altar to burn incenser there upon of and wood shall thy make it a cubit shall be the length thereof and a cubit the breadth thereof four square shall it be and two cubits shall be the height thereof the horns thereof shall be of the same and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold okay and so now we're into the sanctuary we're into the spiritual realm and here's the next place of communion between god and man the next altar and it's the altar of incense and that's the place of prayer okay it's not for everybody it's not for somebody just who has their sins forgiven but it's somebody who's had their sins forgiven and has entered into a relationship with god as a king and a priest that priestly relationship with god okay that sanctification they have they had certain garments that they had to wear all right those garments were white and they were made of linen oh it's just wonderful do you know the word sweat only appears three times in the bible okay sweat oh it's so interesting i don't think i've ever all right so sweat appears in genesis where he says listen by the sweat of your brow you will eat you'll make bread okay and the second time it appears is in ezekiel where it says the priests wore linen garments so that they wouldn't sweat in the service of god okay and the third time is jesus sweat drops of blood for us okay and so if you think of that oh my what are we offering to god because if you're offering your works you're doing what cain did he said i am going to work so hard i'm gonna get the food i'm gonna plow it i'm gonna and i'll have enough that i can offer the food a surplus that he offered to the fruits of the ground okay i'm fulfilling your word god i'm doing the works and here are the extra works to offer to you and god says why are you offering me a bunch of sweat you see and he said if you're a priest i don't want the sweat because it's not about your work you see it's not about your work but we come with the blood of jesus christ we come with his work and we don't offer any of our own sweat it's not of our own works okay and so we say not by my works do i enter into this priestly relationship but based on the blood of jesus christ i sanctify myself i purify myself i put on the garments of holiness i separate myself from this world and i come before you to the next altar that's four square to the altar of incense and i offer the incense and when i offer the incense i offer my prayers up prayers for the nation prayers for people prayers like we've done lord how do i serve you prayers to purify myself okay but we find we can be priests and kings why because jesus broke down every war and read it in ephesians he broke down every wall of partition do you know and they've actually discovered this they've discovered marker stones in archaeological digs in jerusalem and the markers don't say gentiles do not proceed beyond this point and then marcus stone surrounded the core of the gentiles in the in the temple grounds so the gentiles could come into the temple grounds and they could see the temple but there was a certain marker they they couldn't go beyond or it would cause a riot now you remember it caused the riot because uh the the the jews saw paul in the temple with a couple of other people and they assumed hey he's brought temp he's brought gentiles into the temple grounds okay and it caused a big riot and so they've actually found those marker stones uh gentiles can't go beyond this point and then we know that the the jew could go into the uh into the the outer court if you like that that temple by the brass altar the by the but he couldn't go inside the temple why that was reserved for the priests okay but god has broken down that because he's made us priests and kings through his blood so we can enter into this and we know that in the holy places of all only the high priest could enter and only once a year right okay but we know at the death of jesus that veil was rent from the top to the bottom do you know what was in there the holy place of all when it was rent from the top to the bottom it was rent from the top to the bottom and what did it reveal what was behind there anyone know who said the ark it was not the ark it was not the ark because at the time they did not have possession of the ark of the covenant okay yeah it's really interesting and the tradition says at the time of offering that high priest would go into the holiest place of all and he would sprinkle the blood on the stone that was set there which stone they said was a stone that jacob it was either the stone that jacob laid on it was the stone that abraham was to offer isaac on but they didn't have the ark why didn't they have the ark because god wrote it was empty on the inside where was the ark hanging on the cross the meeting place between god and man you see so but anyway we're still at the uh we're still at the place uh the altar of incense and this is the place where god can really speak to you and we can see this in luke chapter one so interesting okay okay there was this is from verse five there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia his wife was of the daughters of aaron her name was elizabeth and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless they had no child because that elizabeth was barren and they were both now well stricken in years and it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before god in the order of his course and they say that there were enough priests that you may only go to the temple for one period of service that's the order of his course okay and so then they would draw lots to say which priest does which duty okay according to the customer of the priest office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense and appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and gabriel came to start that whole process of announcing there's a forerunner coming call his name john and he's gonna he's gonna make he's gonna prepare the way of the lord you see and he appeared at the altar of incense right in front of the veil the closest that any priest could get to the place of the presence of god and so we're also called to be at the altar of incense daily you know that that those prayers that that was a morning and an evening place of a burning of incense okay read your bible pray every day pray without ceasing be in communion with god be listening to god be aware that the place of prayer is the place where god can send angels to speak to you okay the place where god interacts with us the place of communion with god you see so are you at that place are you listening to what god is telling you to do and that's wonderful if you do and and and if you are at that place remember he would not have come to that place except that he'd gone past the altar the brass ultra and made sure that he was cleansed from his sin in order to enter in all right but there's one more place we can go to inside the temple that's four square in the holiest place of all all right and that room was four square it was 15 cubits by 15 cubits in the tabernacle but there's one item that god made in there that's four square oh you know what it is well let's have a read in exodus chapter 25 sorry 28 exodus 28. all right verse 15. it says now shall make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work after the work of the ephod shall thou make it of gold and blue and of purple and of scarless and a fine twined linen shall thou make it four square it shall be being doubled a span shall be the length thereof that's that's a span so it's just just a small thing so we've gone from something that's five cubits to something that's two cubits to something that's just a span you see but this isn't something that's a piece of furniture that stays in the holy place this is the garment of the high priest that he wears into the holy place and then when he leaves the holy place he takes the breastplate with him four square brothers and sisters if you can ever get beyond justification and beyond sanctification in a place of prayer and into that holy of holy place into that secret chamber where god blesses you when you go out you will carry the presence of god with you you see you will carry the presence of god with you and that well you know how david was running from saul and and he would have a decision and he'd say bring heather the ephod because saul had killed all the priests and so david the the priest took the ephod you can read this in the scripture he took that ephod he took that breastplate and he ran to david and he said saul's going to kill me if he finds me i'm going to stay with you and david said i have the presence of god with me now i have the presence of god with me now and when when uh when things would go wrong he would say bring him the effort let's inquire of god and he would ask and the priest would tell him well this or that you see because if you take that breastplate out with you you're taking out with you the dwelling place of god that meeting place of god is now in you and you truly become that tabernacle of god you see and that's what he's building us up into god enthroned in our hearts because jesus broke down being partitioned the the partitions between us and we become the throne of god so now i got a little more if you want me to go on okay i got a little more all right so when with the throne of god god should flow out from us as he flows out from his throne so we should be the representative of god in this world we should be the meeting place where it should be god bless you i'm meeting god when i'm meeting you you see that should be us if we can make our lives if we can now we don't get away from saying we need that brass altar we need that forgiveness of sins that never leaves oh that's a big part of our life you tell me uh if if confessing your sins and asking for your forgiveness is not a big part of your life it's not a big square that's seven and a half feet by seven and a half feet you're probably not in the right tabernacle because the closer you get to god the more you realize the further you are from god okay and so we never lose that necessity of meeting god at the brass altar of forgiveness okay and then the next you never lose that prayer life okay praying for others bringing your incense before god morning and evening in that secret place it may not be such a big part of your life time wise but that's where god is speaking to you okay but we want to get into the inner place where we can carry something out with us to be a blessing to the people we're the throne of god now the throne of god uh is surrounded by the cherubims okay the cherubims that's the lion spirit the man spirit the old spirit and the eagle spirit we're all aware of that yeah and these are the ways that god speaks and god acts in the world with the boldness of a lion with the cunning the intelligence be wiser serpents and harmless as doves yeah of a man with the sight of the eagle and with the service of an ox okay and so we're called to to be the place where god flows out in these ways but the wisdom is well there's a couple of things here first of all the devil loves to impersonate you all right let's turn to daniel chapter seven and we'll see the symbols that the devil comes in all right and this is uh daniel's vision of the four great beasts or the world powers that would would be in control of the world until the time of the end says uh daniel spake verse two i saw in my visions by night and behold the four winds of the heavens strove upon the great sea and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another the first was like a lion and had eagle's wings and i beheld to the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to it there's the antichrist spirit coming as a lion an eagle and a man what's he missing the ox okay do you want something that's brand new well at least i mean listen all of this stuff is is is as ancient as the bible is and as i'm changing but sometimes god just dropped something in okay this this just came uh all right so the devil likes to impersonate the lion the boldness of the lion the devil likes to impersonate the sight of an eagle and come with that false prophet and the false prophecy and be thus saith the lord and and and take the names lord in vain if that really is taking the laid name the name of the lord in vain telling people false things in the name of the lord all right great judgment is upon those people okay coming with the wisdom as a man to to subtly deceive but i i used to think he never comes as an ox never because he never comes as a servant as a service okay but then i saw something i said ah that's where the false spirit appears as an ox because you remember ah it just blows my mind there's the children of israel they're led through the desert they have manner given to them they have water given to them god is providing their needs he takes them up to a mountain he appears to them and they say we're too scared just send moses he says right bring moses up the mountain moses is up the mountain okay and in 40 days in front of the mountain they lose all their faith and they say to aaron we don't know what's happened yeah that it's become common to them and so aaron says well give me all your earrings okay so it takes all the earrings and he throws them into a fire and what comes out a calf a false god okay and so the calf is is you see the the the fourth one the false well what does that mean to us all right let's this is so good let's turn to colossians chapter two all right okay verse 13 and you being dead in your sins and this is the progression being dead in your sins the uncircumcision of your flesh has he quickened given you new life having forgiven you all trespasses our praise god blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in them okay now we're going to get to it let no man therefore judge you in meat or drink or in respect of holy days or of the new moon or sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ so what's what's the feast days what's the new moons what's the meat it's like okay um there's uh there's a catholic tradition that you you don't eat uh meat on fridays okay and you know no particular harm but if it becomes a commandment then it becomes difficult because then you say if you eat fish on fridays then you're going to hell instead of going to heaven all right and so this brings you into bondage of sacrifice and service and that's the manifestation of the calf spirit in the wrong way that place of service but of service to the wrong spirit you know it's so ridiculous how many know what a cacabarro is okay so how many know what like a a hamster is you know what hamster is okay a cacabarro is a the biggest kind of hamster in the world it lives in um it lives in the amazon region and so it's a basically it's a big guinea pig and it swims in the water it's a water creature okay and when the uh catholics came to south america the priests actually said um because they were going hungry on fridays because they couldn't find enough fish to feed everybody they said that the cacabarro is actually a fish so they could eat it on fridays yeah you can look out it's amazing the leaps and bounds that man has to do to conform his religion well anyway so we can eat fish on fridays or kakabarros and we won't go to hell if you're a catholic all right but the point is let's carry on let no man begow you of a reward in the voluntary humility of voluntary humility the worshipping of angels intruding into those things he has not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind not holding to the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increases with the increase of god wherefore if you be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why is there living in the world are you subject to ordinances taste not touch not hand or not which will perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men which indeed have a show of wisdom in will worship oh interesting phrase will worship are you worshiping your will your ability to do something your ability to to uh you know oh i i fast twice a day i give tithes of all that i have i can do this because i have a strong will i will not fall to sin oh that's a good thing i'm not saying yeah let's all fall to sin but i'm saying if you are keeping yourself from sin because like uh i don't know like like um an athlete keeps themselves from eating chocolates because they don't want to spoil their their diet regime sure how what glory does that give to god okay it's like lord take this from me deliver me cleanse me renew my conscience so that where i'm resisting and i'm not saying yeah resist in your own power absolutely don't go into sin but you should be saying if it's tempting me this hmm how does it say that the the uh the sinner once purged has no more consciousness of sin all right and so that means if you have consciousness of sins you haven't been purged properly now that's not a problem because we are building we're a process it's not i haven't been purged i'm the most evil person no no no no it's like i haven't been purged god purge me some more okay but if you can say i'm tempted by this all but i'm strong enough to resist there's your will worship okay rather than relying on god and saying lord help me a very very subtle distinction there but i hope you can see what i'm saying and this is the way that the devil presents as that calf as that piece of burden as that beast of sacrifice and you're sacrificing but it's to the wrong thing okay yeah so how are you approaching these things how are you manifesting the word of god to others that meet you are you being a four-square christian yeah the lion the ox the man the eagle and letting god lead you to express his word as appropriate and remembering that it's in the service and humility that we really see the difference between the spirit of god and the spirit of the devil ah you got time for some more okay all right here's a good one okay revelations 3 12. all right now remember the blessings given to the church ages one is given to each church age but they add up the revelation of christ is one to each church age but they add up to the full revelation of jesus christ and the blessings giving to the church ages are added up to the full blessing that god gives so it's not like he says you know uh to the church in laodicea to him that overcometh will i grant to sit on my throne even as i overcame and someone from philadelphia he's going to be saying sorry sorry you can't sit on the throne that wasn't your blessing he's going to say this is the complete blessing for the complete body all right so revelations chapter 3 verse 12. so this is blessing for us as well him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write on him my new name oh that's a blessing all right go back to that verse i didn't read that yet okay so what are we talking about four square four squared this is the new jerusalem that city that's built four square and you're going to be a pillar in the temple of my god let's have a turn now to ezekiel chapter 41 and we see where ezekiel saw the temple in verse 21 and it says and the posts the pillars the posts of the temple were squared that's the same word in exodus as four squared okay so if you want to be a post a pillar in the temple of god you got to be four squared okay you've got to be that meeting place between god and man okay that four steps of the meeting place the altar of sin yeah the brass altar where you get rid of your sins the altar of incense where you pray and you hear the word of god and you talk to god and there's communion the holiest place of all where god meets you four square and then the breastplate that you carry out from with you that you can be the representative of god to those around you and you become the meeting place so that when people meet you they meet god amen so how are we meeting people how are we meeting people are we meeting people in the flesh or are we meeting people foursquare okay are we recognizing that that foursquare process isn't it's not one and done okay it's every day we need to go and cleanse ourselves and wash ourselves it's every day we need to offer the incense of prayer to our god and hear from him it's every day that we need to enter into that holy place for jesus made a way that we could be kings and priests putting on the righteous garments that he gives to us you see and every day that we should be taking the breastplate of foursquare out into the world and saying do you need to know my god am i representing god in the right spiritual way because the devil has an impersonation for everything all right even laying down your life you can lay down your life all you want and god will say well depart from me you workers of iniquity i never even knew you it was a wrong spirit that you laid down your life to i hope that's a blessing to you i hope that that will help us to be more foursquare as christians brothers and sisters as ambassadors to god in this world amen i think you know the song i want god's way to be my way as a journey here below for there is no other highway that a child of god should know though the way be sweet and rough if he leads me that's enough i want god's way to be my way every day let's pray heavenly father may your way be our way may we line ourselves up to that four square service that you have for us that we could be representative of you here on the earth while we're waiting for the kingdom of heaven to come and bring that great four square city down may we be ambassadors for that to bring people into you lord may we keep your blood sacrifice always before us to clean us may we always be in spiritual communion with you may we carry the very presence of god to others through the holy spirit not letting ourselves get in the way but lord letting you lead us and be our our foursquare guide we ask in jesus name amen amen though the wave is steep or rough if he leads me that's enough i want god's way to be my way every day i want god's way to be my way as i journey here below for there is no other highway that this child of god should know [Music] i want god's way to [Music] amen remember you're only ever one step away from getting back on god's path there's something here that's burdening you today and saying lord this is where i'm lacking there's something that says lord this is where you want to build something in me that i haven't been giving to you that haven't been laying you know right now free from the distractions of the outside is a good place to really make a recommitment to say lord i give this to you lord let me live my life for you because if we don't do it here you're not going to do it anywhere else now that's not saying you can't do it outside do it wherever god puts it on your heart but now's a good time just to ask him lord help me wherever i need help it's different for each one of us commit your thoughts to the lord amen let's sing that chorus through one more time and we'll ask brother dan to come up and come out [Music] i want god's way is child of god [Music] [Music] every day praise the lord shall we just get [Music] [Applause] [Music] how many in here
