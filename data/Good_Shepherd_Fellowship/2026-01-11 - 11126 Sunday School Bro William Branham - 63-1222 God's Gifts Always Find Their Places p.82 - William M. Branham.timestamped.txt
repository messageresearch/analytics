[2:38] Jesus in the city of Nazareth, the
[2:41] meanest city there was in the land. But
[2:44] God chose a little lady to give birth to
[2:47] his son.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; A decabator, a womb that had to a baby
[2:51] had to be born by. He took such a person
[2:54] to do it. God works through human beings
[2:57] to redeem human beings. He can take you
[3:01] work through you to redeem humanity. If
[3:03] you'll completely dedicate everything
[3:06] you are. If you're a young woman,
[3:07] dedicate your morals. You're a young
[3:10] man, dedicate your morals. Dedicate your
[3:12] mind. Dedicate your thinking. Dedicate
[3:14] your heart. Dedicate your soul. Dedicate
[3:17] all you are.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Let Christ work through that. What a
[3:22] glorious thing. Got the rivers to cross.
[3:25] You got the the bridges to go over.
[3:27] You've got the You got the fire patches.
[3:30] You got the thicket. You got the woods.
[3:32] You got the dark places. You've got the
[3:34] high hills. You got the high climbs.
[3:37] What are you doing? Someday you'll have
[3:38] to stand there and look back. See where
[3:40] you come from. And you're going to be
[3:41] judged by the course you take.
[3:44] Put your your all your mind and your
[3:48] thoughts on that north star, the center
[3:51] of God, and don't move from it. Stay
[3:54] right with it. It'll bring you straight
[3:56] like it did the magi, right straight to
[3:59] the Christ. All right?
[4:02] Anointed him with mira. We find out now
[4:04] in John 12 1 and 7, that's just exactly
[4:08] what he done. He was a perfect servant
[4:11] of God and had him anointed with all of
[4:15] his divine gifts.
[4:18] He was anointed with all God's gift
[4:20] because he was God. He was God. See,
[4:24] they brought him gifts. Now we'll be I
[4:27] wish the people here always uh most of
[4:31] you know send you something. Now when he
[4:33] comes back to send him back, I couldn't
[4:36] do it. See, it's a world over. I just
[4:38] couldn't do it. And I appreciate the
[4:39] little little things and things that
[4:41] people does to express herself and their
[4:44] thankfulness and so forth. Now this is
[4:46] what these rich men done. These men are
[4:49] magi. They bought gold, pure gold. They
[4:53] brought frankincense, the best they
[4:55] could find. They brought mura, the best
[4:58] they could find. We realize over here in
[5:00] St. John 12, we find out that this
[5:02] woman, if we had time to read it, but I
[5:05] don't want to keep you too long to see
[5:06] cuz I know tomorrow is Monday. You know,
[5:08] somebody had to work. Look, they brought
[5:10] this this woman brought this mirror,
[5:14] that anointed costly something to take
[5:17] the smell of dead away. And she broke
[5:20] this alabaster box and poured it up on
[5:23] the head of Jesus. And Judas said, "Why,
[5:25] this ought to have been given to the
[5:27] poor." said not that he had respect for
[5:29] the poor but he was a thief to begin
[5:31] with. He carried the money and said this
[5:34] ought to have been sold instead of part
[5:36] and Jesus said let her alone
[5:39] for she did this she anointed him until
[5:43] his burial.
[5:45] Right.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; See this woman so grateful that her sins
[5:49] were forgiven until she spent all her
[5:52] money she had and took it out of the
[5:53] pastor box and broke it and tore the oil
[5:56] and just ordered the room with fine
[5:58] smell of this mirror that she had
[6:01] anointed him for his death. Now see she
[6:04] did the service not knowing what she was
[6:06] doing but she was so grateful to God.
[6:10] And if you're so grateful for Christmas,
[6:13] just not to say, "I I give Jones as a
[6:15] gift, they give me one back, I'll see
[6:17] what I got in the morning." Won't you
[6:19] open up your heart and see what's in
[6:20] there?
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Find out what you got in here. And
[6:25] except if you find it empty with just
[6:27] negative creeds and and and
[6:30] cares of the world, why not
[6:33] ask Christ to fill it tonight?
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Tonight. so that you can get the real
[6:38] meaning of Christmas. It it's Christ in
[6:41] you, God dwelling in the human heart.
[6:45] That's what the real Christmas means.
[6:48] But you see, today we become so
[6:50] negative. It's a devil getting us
[6:52] through that. It's painted candy sticks
[6:54] and and a reindeer and and a whiskered
[6:57] man and flies through the air like an
[6:59] airplane and visits the whole world and
[7:01] every home with a little fun of toys on
[7:03] his back and visits every child.
[7:06] It's it's just a lie. It's just right
[7:08] out of line. See? Now, see, but what the
[7:12] devil did that so we could twist the
[7:14] minds of people. The commercial world
[7:16] got into it and they well, they make
[7:18] enough through Christmas time until they
[7:21] can retire the rest of the year almost.
[7:23] I talked to a merchant the other day. He
[7:25] said, "You give me these two weeks and
[7:26] if I didn't have to keep my band here,"
[7:28] said I'd wait till next Christmas. I
[7:31] could go fishing or whatever I want to
[7:32] do till next Christmas. He said, "But I
[7:34] keep the boys going to just keep me here
[7:36] just enough to keep my business open and
[7:38] it keeps it keeps my hands paid off and
[7:40] things I don't pay nothing till
[7:41] Christmas time comes on." You see, it's
[7:44] become a great commercial thing when it
[7:46] ought to be a worship.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; Worship. Now God so anointed Jesus with
[7:54] the fullness of himself to the he was
[7:58] God's gift to the world that the wise
[8:02] men are clearly identified that their
[8:06] offering their gift to him showed that
[8:10] in their heart they knew who he was and
[8:13] what he was going to do for them. So no
[8:17] wonder the first thing they did, they
[8:19] fell down perfectly in order and
[8:21] worshiped him before they could even
[8:24] understand it. They fell down and
[8:25] worshiped it and then presented their
[8:28] gifts. That's the way to have real
[8:29] Christmas. Worship him then present your
[8:32] gift. Presenting your body as a living
[8:35] sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.
[8:39] But you know what?
[8:40] The wise men did that.
[8:43] The father and mother of Christ that
[8:46] foster father of course and also a
[8:48] mother because God was both his father
[8:50] and mother. But we find
[9:00] out that they
[10:06] Now God has so anointed Jesus with the
[10:10] fullness of himself to the he was God's
[10:14] gift to the world that the wise men are
[10:19] clearly identified that their offering
[10:22] their gift to him showed that in their
[10:26] heart they knew who he was and what he
[10:30] was going to do for them. So no wonder
[10:33] the first thing they did they fell down
[10:35] perfectly in order and worshiped him
[10:38] before they could even understand it.
[10:40] They fell down and worshiping and then
[10:43] presented their gifts. That's the way to
[10:45] have real Christmas. Worship him then
[10:48] present your gift. presenting your body
[10:50] as a living sacrifice, holy and
[10:53] acceptable to God. But you know what
[10:56] after the wise man did that?
[10:59] The father and mother of Christ that
[11:02] fostered father of course and also a
[11:03] mother because God was both his father
[11:06] and mother. But we find out that they
[11:09] accepted these gifts from these wise
[11:11] men. No wonder they were called wise
[11:14] men. They were wise.
[11:17] They were really had wisdom. If man
[11:21] today would just be that wise
[11:25] just as w it takes a wise man to come to
[11:27] Christ. A man that turns away from him
[11:30] is an unwise man. But it takes a wise
[11:32] man to come to Christ. Now notice and
[11:35] after that the wise man identifying him
[11:40] what he would be and we find through the
[11:42] scripture that's exactly what he was
[11:44] deity in service or death.
[11:47] What's Paul? Deity in service to God or
[11:51] death. Jesus was deity in service or
[11:56] death to redeem the world. But what did
[12:00] the world do to it? They refused.
[12:04] They rejected. Why? Some of them, a big
[12:08] part of them did that because this
[12:12] because he did die.
[12:14] They said he couldn't be deity enough.
[12:18] The man, the body was not deity,
[12:23] but deity was in the body.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; This body has to perish.
[12:29] The very Christ that's in you is the
[12:31] only thing that can raise you up. That's
[12:32] deity. God in you. Now notice now the
[12:37] same as now they reject identified
[12:42] deity.
[12:45] Do you get it?
[12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; They will certainly put their name on a
[12:48] church book and say I'll try to live
[12:50] with this creed. They'll take an oath by
[12:52] this. But when it comes to accepting
[12:56] deity and expressing back the same kind
[12:59] of a gift like they did that you are
[13:02] identified by your gift
[13:05] that you give your entire being to it
[13:10] to identify deity. Then you identify
[13:14] yourself with the deity by giving all
[13:17] you are what you are to deity himself.
[13:22] Now Christ in this day that we now live
[13:25] in is still de
[13:29] identifying himself deity among the
[13:33] people.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; He's still deity because he is the word.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; And when we see the word living itself,
[13:43] then we know that man can do that. It's
[13:46] deity, the word being made manifest by
[13:50] man.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus said himself, "The Son
[13:53] can do nothing in himself.
[13:56] I can't do nothing. I'm a man." Jesus
[13:58] said, "But my father that dwelleth in
[14:02] me, HE SHOWETH THEE ALL things that
[14:05] himself doeth."
[14:07] Amen. There you are. What is it? Deity
[14:11] being identified in man. Amen.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Now the same thing is today that deity
[14:19] the promised word for this day can
[14:22] identify itself in you.
[14:25] Amen. Then give your whole to it. Show
[14:29] that you believe in it. Give it deity.
[14:32] Believe it. Service. Be ready to die
[14:35] onto yourself in your own thoughts. But
[14:37] today it's rejected as it was then.
[14:40] Notice
[14:42] God guided the magi with them gifts
[14:47] for practically two years. They followed
[14:49] that star.
[14:51] See, and that shows it couldn't be one
[14:52] of the natural things that happened.
[14:55] See, because if the stars crossing their
[14:58] orbits would have crossed, it would show
[15:01] there was something different because
[15:03] unless those magi saw it long time
[15:05] before it happened and know they had to
[15:07] cross that way, see then the path they
[15:09] were coming in and they crossed just at
[15:10] Bethlehem at that time started from up
[15:12] there beforehand knowing that these
[15:14] heavenly bodies were moving that way.
[15:17] Now God guided the magi because they had
[15:20] the right gift.
[15:24] God guided these wise men because they
[15:30] had the right identified gift to
[15:33] identify his son.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Can you get it?
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Wise man today. Wise in the name of the
[15:43] Lord.
[15:45] not with some fictitious something but
[15:47] with the GIFT THAT GOD PROMISED FOR THIS
[15:49] DAY AND GOD WILL GUIDE you to identify
[15:54] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[15:56] today and forever.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; There you are. Wise man. God guided
[16:06] those gifts because they were the gifts
[16:09] to identify him.
[16:12] and wise man today who can look away
[16:15] from church entity and all the things of
[16:18] the world to the living word of God and
[16:22] God will identify his son by his word
[16:25] because that's what he is. I my father
[16:29] are one and in the beginning was the
[16:31] word and the word is with God and the
[16:32] word was God and the word was made flesh
[16:34] and dwelt among us and the same word
[16:37] today he's the same yesterday today and
[16:39] forever.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a wise man follows that
[16:44] because that's what God takes care OF TO
[16:47] IDENTIFY HIMSELF BY IT.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; A gift, a real identified gift of God,
[16:56] God brings up to everything like that TO
[16:59] IDENTIFY HIMSELF BY. AMEN. And that's
[17:02] how Christ was identified. By gold, my
[17:06] frankincense by damn man foreshadowing
[17:10] and showing in type what his life was to
[17:12] be.
[17:14] See deity manifested for service to die
[17:19] that he might redeem the nation because
[17:20] he was to save his people from their
[17:23] sin. Not save the world, save his people
[17:28] from their sin. The Bible say you're but
[17:30] and in his name will the Gentiles trust.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; The Gentiles will trust in his name.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, the bride, the
[17:41] called out of the Gentiles will be
[17:42] trusting in the name of Jesus Christ.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; In his name shall the Gentiles trust.
[17:49] Now, God guided them for they were the
[17:52] gifts that they were giving were fitting
[17:56] to the time. Notice
[18:00] God said God has he he divided his word
[18:02] at the beginning in Genesis. I can take
[18:04] Genesis and show you every age in the
[18:07] Bible down to this age here. All the
[18:09] cults and things we had there. I can
[18:11] show you exactly where there was in
[18:12] Genesis. See, God gave his word so much
[18:16] here, so much here, so much here for
[18:18] each age. And then he sent a prophet
[18:20] down anointed to make that word come to
[18:23] pass and support the other that was
[18:25] coming. See, like the Messiah always
[18:29] supported every prophet in his own life,
[18:32] his own being, the word that was given
[18:34] for that day he come and fulfilled that
[18:37] written word and fortold of what the
[18:39] other was going to be
[18:42] &gt;&gt; and every one of them spoke of him.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he was the fullness. HE
[18:47] WAS THE HEAD OF THE PROPHETS. HE WAS THE
[18:49] WORD OF GOD. HE was the prophets.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; There is. Notice how wonderful what he
[18:57] was. Each one of those prophets. Then
[18:59] when he comes, he was the fullness of
[19:01] all the prophets manifested because they
[19:04] were the word of the Lord. And he said
[19:06] himself, if you call those gods whom the
[19:10] word of God come to, how can you condemn
[19:12] me when I say I'm the son of God?
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Even those in that age was identified as
[19:19] gods. God called them himself gods. What
[19:23] were they? They were manifestations of
[19:26] his word.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; And here WAS HE THE FULLNESS of the
[19:30] word. Deity in body.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Deity manifested in the flesh. What? For
[19:39] these gifts that these men brought. They
[19:42] couldn't have brought that to a prophet.
[19:44] Would have been right. See them gifts
[19:46] couldn't have went to Elijah. They
[19:48] couldn't have went to Moses. They had to
[19:50] come to him. And then those gifts were
[19:53] strictly meant for that day and was to
[19:56] identify who he was by these gifts. Then
[19:59] here come along and protected it and
[20:02] kept them two years down there until
[20:04] they found the perfect life. How
[20:06] fitting. Same thing today. We got
[20:08] people. This is loyal, nice people,
[20:12] genuine people. But you see in that
[20:16] there's going to be something come forth
[20:18] that God's always done to identify this
[20:22] day. This is the day when these things
[20:25] are spoken to happen. Amen.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; There won't be many, just a very, very
[20:30] few that'll be saved. The Bible said so.
[20:34] There'll be just a handful. Jesus said
[20:36] himself as it was in the days of Noah.
[20:39] We're in eight souls were saved.
[20:42] Eight souls. out of a a generation like
[20:46] into this as it was the days of Noah.
[20:49] What was it? Great cultured people,
[20:53] great workers, great builders, great
[20:55] everything as they had made civilization
[20:57] just like it. Great things that they had
[21:00] as it were in the days of Noah. So will
[21:03] it be in the coming of the son of man.
[21:05] See, God had Noah to identify his
[21:11] promised word. It was very fitting. The
[21:14] ark was fitting to the word of God that
[21:16] he spoke and he would destroy man. But
[21:19] he saved what he could. Now these wise
[21:21] men bringing their gifts identified
[21:24] their gifts identified what it was. And
[21:27] that's the reason God protected those
[21:28] gifts to every move that they made. He
[21:31] protected until they arrived with those
[21:34] gifts because they were fitting for the
[21:37] time.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Does my church understand that?
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what's going on now.
[21:45] I hope it ain't over your head. I have
[21:46] to speak it in parable almost. You see,
[21:49] but do you see it's the thing that's
[21:51] happening is fitting for this day.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Lady Gia,
[21:56] &gt;&gt; it's a fitting time. That's reason God
[21:59] has protected. See, brought it right
[22:01] through to identify himself gifts.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Though it cost a death and put a stomach
[22:07] block in their waist, it's a bending
[22:09] time. That's right. Fitting for the day.
[22:13] That's the reason God has protected the
[22:15] way he has. He will protect it until his
[22:18] purpose is served.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I read a story
[22:25] come to my mind not long ago
[22:28] of something on that order. was in a
[22:30] great city here in this nation and New
[22:35] York and it was on Christmas Eve and
[22:39] there was a poor family little daddy he
[22:42] had TV and he was his wife had TV they
[22:45] had been underprivileged
[22:48] and he he kind of he's weakly and so
[22:51] nobody would hire him he had no
[22:52] education and he he people didn't want
[22:55] him he just as an outcast become a
[22:57] trance trust you know What a is
[23:00] just go by and pick up something and
[23:02] paddle it and get what they can. What
[23:04] little uh royalty they make on it. They
[23:07] try to live by just a like a peddler or
[23:10] something on the street. Go buy some
[23:12] pins and needles and thimbles and
[23:14] whatever they can and and take it and
[23:16] and maybe buy them for a penny a pack
[23:19] and sell them for a nickel and make four
[23:21] cents on the pack. Maybe in the run of a
[23:23] day that's a great commission. But just
[23:25] think all he sell in a day maybe make 20
[23:28] 30 cents a day and he had a family and
[23:33] the little wife being weakly she she
[23:36] died
[23:38] and it was coming Christmas time and the
[23:40] little girl she had developed from
[23:42] malnutrition not having the right food
[23:45] and things uh she took TV also and she
[23:49] had a little fella about eight nine
[23:52] years old 10 and she
[23:55] never had a dog for Christmas and that's
[23:58] what she wanted for a gift was a dog
[24:02] and the father not able to give her
[24:05] medical attention and so forth and he
[24:08] you seen the little girl was going fast
[24:10] and he tried his best to to to to get
[24:14] enough money together to get her a doll
[24:17] for Christmas if he could just get
[24:19] enough to buy her a little doll. And so
[24:22] the
[24:24] Christmas time was coming on. The bad
[24:26] weather set in. The little girl
[24:29] developed some kind of a pneumonia and
[24:32] and she died just a few weeks before
[24:35] Christmas.
[24:37] And the father of course brokenhearted
[24:41] went to his little tin can and got the
[24:43] money out and he thought of his little
[24:45] girl that she wanted a dog like little
[24:50] girl. See, it's a little mother coming
[24:52] on. You notice how a little girl she
[24:53] goes to the doll because she's that's
[24:55] her nature. She's a she's a coming
[24:56] mother.
[24:58] She will be mother someday she lives and
[25:01] everything nor nature. That's a little
[25:03] girl likes a little doll. She want take
[25:05] care of because after all she she's a
[25:07] little potentially a little mother and
[25:11] she wanted a little doll. She never had
[25:13] one. And daddy had saved everything he
[25:16] could to get her a little doll. And so
[25:20] she died and the father kind of had a
[25:23] lapse of mind. His wife had been taking
[25:26] the little girl and his mind kind of got
[25:29] to a place that he still he go to bed
[25:32] every night and talk to this little girl
[25:34] though she was been buried but he
[25:37] thought he he was talking to her and
[25:38] tell her now honey it won't be long.
[25:41] Daddy's going to get you this dolly for
[25:42] Christmas and daddy's promised you the
[25:45] dolly and I I'm I'm going to get it.
[25:48] Finally Christmas arrived. And of course
[25:52] you know how it is. The rich had their
[25:54] their big parties and the candles
[25:58] burning and the great high masses in the
[26:01] churches and talking about Jesus and and
[26:05] so forth. the churches were going
[26:07] through all kind of routines of mass and
[26:11] singing and carols and everything.
[26:14] Little did he know what was going on
[26:17] back in the alley behind all this. This
[26:20] uh little fella back there and he got
[26:23] beside himself. He wanted that little
[26:24] girl to have that dollar back cuz she
[26:26] had begged so for this little doll.
[26:30] So he went out and he bought her a
[26:33] little rag doll, a little uh little
[26:36] thing, probably about 30 cents, a little
[26:38] dirty something bought down on the side
[26:41] of the street. And it was a real cold
[26:44] night. the the blizzard winds are
[26:46] blowing, snow falling hard there in New
[26:49] York, down on the coast, the streets
[26:50] filling up and the people in their great
[26:54] big limousine, cars and drunken parties
[26:56] out drinking the celebration of the
[26:58] birth of Christ and of these things that
[27:02] we speak of tonight trying to think that
[27:05] that's the right way to do it is to
[27:07] drink off their old sorrows and things
[27:09] and that's that's the way to do it. call
[27:10] up stay in the store the other day and a
[27:12] woman talked about what two girls met
[27:14] who won't know what they got for their
[27:16] daddy and one of them said well she got
[27:18] him a carton of certain kind of
[27:19] cigarettes and the other said she got
[27:21] him a fifth of whiskey and a and a and a
[27:23] deck of car that ain't given a memorial
[27:27] gift for the birth of the Lord Jesus
[27:29] Christ and that's way it goes you see
[27:32] it's just a big bunch of tinsel it
[27:35] hasn't got Christmas in it at all and so
[27:39] we find out this little man. He wandered
[27:42] along and he know his heart his little
[27:45] girl was gone, but he went and bought
[27:47] the doll anyhow. And he thought, I'll
[27:49] just start walking. I'll find her
[27:51] somewhere. She'll be along the street
[27:53] here and I'll find her. And he started
[27:56] walking. He he couldn't fool himself.
[27:57] She wasn't back there in a little shanty
[27:59] and in the little ragged dirty bed, but
[28:02] uh she was buried. So he he knew he
[28:06] thought he'd find her on the street. He
[28:07] said, "I'll just keep walking." And he's
[28:10] going down through the alleys while they
[28:11] were singing their carols and going on
[28:14] and going down the alley packing this
[28:16] little dirty doll holded in his coat up
[28:18] to his heart thinking of his little
[28:20] girl. And finally a policeman happened
[28:24] to see him and policeman had a few
[28:26] drinks himself and he run into the alley
[28:28] and grabbed the old man and turned him
[28:30] around. He said, "What are you doing
[28:34] hanging here?" He said, "I'm taking this
[28:37] little doll, sir, to my little girl." He
[28:42] said, "Where do you live?" And he told
[28:44] him, "Where you live?" He said, "Well,
[28:46] you're going away from that place.
[28:47] You're drunk. Go back the other way." He
[28:50] said, "Sir, I'm not drunk. I promise my
[28:52] little girl I' I'd get her a gift for
[28:55] Christmas."
[28:57] And said, "An appropriate gift for a
[28:59] little girl is a little doll." And he
[29:02] said, "Let me see it." So he showed him
[29:04] a little dirty rag doll is holding in
[29:08] his next to his bosom holding a little
[29:10] doll as he. So the policeman half drunk
[29:13] himself shoved him on and started down.
[29:15] The old man went down the alley. Snow
[29:18] falling fast and
[29:20] well the midnight parties broke up. The
[29:23] next morning the snow lit up. The sun
[29:26] had come out. So there was all the
[29:30] people from their great gay parties. eye
[29:33] sacks on their heads from too much
[29:34] drinking and celebration of the the
[29:36] birth of Christ and and many of them
[29:39] were forced and caring all from all the
[29:42] going on. But way down in the alley
[29:45] they found the old man
[29:48] and when he turned him over he had
[29:51] little doll next to his heart.
[29:54] I suppose he tuck his gift to him. He
[29:57] bound her in a way not here.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Right. He he he tucked the gift. It was
[30:02] an appropriate gift.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; God merciful. Yet it cost him his death.
[30:08] There's no other way in the world he
[30:09] could have given her the gift. She was
[30:11] buried.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; But the only way he could do it would be
[30:14] go like that.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:20] [clears throat]
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Little doll.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean too much. I guess a little
[30:25] dirty face doll. But it What did he do?
[30:28] It fulfilled a promise he had made.
[30:31] Amen.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; No matter what the people thought about
[30:33] it, his dirty hands and a little dirty
[30:35] doll, but it fulfilled a promise to his
[30:37] little girl.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
