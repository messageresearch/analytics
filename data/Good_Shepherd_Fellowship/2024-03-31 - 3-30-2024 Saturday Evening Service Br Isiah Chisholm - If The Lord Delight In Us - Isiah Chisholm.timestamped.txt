[1:01:36] words is God is pleased with us then he

[1:01:53] give you the desires of your heart you
[1:01:57] know I don't know what our desire

[1:02:06] yesterday today and forever amen delight
[1:02:09] yourself in the Lord and He will give
[1:02:12] you the desires of your heart you know I
[1:02:16] was just I was talking uh uh to my wife
[1:02:20] just the other day you know after we saw
[1:02:23] the tragedy of what happened in in
[1:02:26] Baltimore where uh that that dock ran
[1:02:29] into the that pillow and caused all that
[1:02:32] tragedy and lives been lost and and they
[1:02:35] said that it could have been
[1:02:38] prevented but what caused that and as
[1:02:41] they begin to investigate what caused uh
[1:02:45] that to happen that bridge was standing
[1:02:47] for many years but all of a sudden
[1:02:50] something went wrong so I I told my wife
[1:02:53] I said you think about the children of
[1:02:57] Israel they was down in Egypt and how
[1:03:00] the prophet of God said that Egypt was a
[1:03:03] type of the world or an
[1:03:06] organization can you say Amen Egypt was
[1:03:09] a type of the world or an
[1:03:12] organization and we saw how that the
[1:03:16] children of Israel amen how they was in
[1:03:20] bondage for so many years amen and and
[1:03:24] and God here The Cry of the children of
[1:03:27] Israel and God raised up a man by the
[1:03:31] name uh of Moses a Shepherd uh kept the
[1:03:35] flock of Jethro his father-in-law and
[1:03:38] and God sent Moses down to Egypt Amen to
[1:03:43] bring the children of Israel out of
[1:03:45] Egypt they was under the Taskmaster of
[1:03:49] uh Pharaoh the king of Egypt and you
[1:03:52] think about uh what they had to do down
[1:03:55] in Egypt eyp and I want to thank I want
[1:03:57] to tell you saints of God you know you
[1:03:59] said brother children now you you talk
[1:04:01] about down in Egypt you know we're the
[1:04:03] Bride of Jesus Christ I I glad you feel
[1:04:05] that way you know a lot of you may say
[1:04:07] well brother Chism we're not in Egypt
[1:04:10] I'm glad you know that amen but I just
[1:04:12] want to remind you uh of something that
[1:04:16] Apostle Paul said here in First
[1:04:19] Corinthian as it come to my mind in
[1:04:21] First Corinthian the 10th chapter in
[1:04:24] verse one it says more over Brethren I
[1:04:27] would not that you should be ignorant
[1:04:29] how that all our father were under the
[1:04:32] cloud and all passed through uh the sea
[1:04:37] and were all baptized unto Moses in the
[1:04:40] cloud and in the sea and did all eat the
[1:04:44] same spiritual meat and did all drink
[1:04:48] the same spiritual drink for they drank
[1:04:51] of that spiritual rock that followed
[1:04:53] them and that rock was Christ but with
[1:04:58] many of them God was not well pleased
[1:05:02] for they were overthrown in the
[1:05:05] wilderness now these things were our
[1:05:09] example to the intent that we should not
[1:05:13] lust after evil things as they also
[1:05:18] lusted let's look at verse 10 what it it
[1:05:21] says neither mumber ye as some of them
[1:05:26] also
[1:05:28] M and and very destroyed by of the
[1:05:32] Destroyer now all these things happen
[1:05:35] unto them for an
[1:05:37] example as they are written for our
[1:05:41] ammonition upon whom the end of the
[1:05:44] world are come wherefore let
[1:05:48] him thanth that thanth he standeth take
[1:05:54] heed lest he fall you know I I think
[1:05:59] brother and
[1:06:00] sister the children of Israel were down
[1:06:03] in the Egypt
[1:06:05] crying for delivered and God raised up
[1:06:09] Moses amen a Vindicated Prophet with
[1:06:13] thus said the Lord signs and W going
[1:06:17] down into Egypt bringing them out of
[1:06:22] Egypt bringing them from out of under
[1:06:25] the bond AG of
[1:06:27] pharaoh but you know brother and sister
[1:06:31] as they were down in Egypt am man they
[1:06:34] was rejoicing they was happy to know
[1:06:37] that God sent them a
[1:06:40] deliverer amen
[1:06:43] and and Moses as Moses uh begin to bring
[1:06:48] the children of Israel out of Egypt man
[1:06:53] I can imagine how rejoicing in they they
[1:06:57] were can you say amen amen amen and as
[1:07:01] the children of Israel journeyed also
[1:07:04] now as they went they was giving an
[1:07:08] angel to guide them or to bring them to
[1:07:11] a place that God had
[1:07:15] promised that angel was sent by there
[1:07:18] not that angel was seen by their natural
[1:07:21] eyes which was a pillar of fire that LED
[1:07:25] them through the Wilderness and and and
[1:07:29] give us the same Pillar of Fire how many
[1:07:32] you glad to know that which is nothing
[1:07:35] else but the
[1:07:37] word what was that pillow fire what was
[1:07:42] that angel any scholar here any of these
[1:07:46] Brethren of the learning mens out there
[1:07:49] know that that angel of the Covenant was
[1:07:53] Christ himself sh it wasu my God God
[1:07:59] Amen brought them out amen God by a
[1:08:04] Vindicated Prophet but you know brothers
[1:08:07] and sister I'm I'm thinking about as
[1:08:09] they came out you know something that
[1:08:12] they never seen before here here's the
[1:08:15] pill Fire by night and the cloud by day
[1:08:19] that was leading them amen out of Egypt
[1:08:22] was taking them into the Promised Land
[1:08:25] amen and they was rejoicing but let me
[1:08:28] tell you Church how they all amen
[1:08:31] escaped out of Egypt because they had
[1:08:33] the blood uh on the door por and the
[1:08:36] lent of the door amen and the de Angel
[1:08:39] was to come through and God requirement
[1:08:42] says when I see the blood God didn't
[1:08:45] said if I see a an animal or if I see
[1:08:48] that lamb but if I see that blood how
[1:08:51] many thank God the blood is on our heart
[1:08:53] tonight amen he said when I see the
[1:08:56] blood I will pass over you amen and you
[1:09:00] see how the children of Israel how they
[1:09:03] when they came out amen you know and and
[1:09:06] and uh coming out of Egypt and the
[1:09:10] prophet of God said they had no idea
[1:09:14] what was ahead of them can I just read
[1:09:17] what the prophet
[1:09:18] said Hallelujah when Israel left Egypt
[1:09:23] for the promised land and Exodus 13 and
[1:09:26] 21 God knowing that they had never
[1:09:30] traveled that way before it was the only
[1:09:35] 40 miles but yet they needed something
[1:09:39] to go with
[1:09:41] them they lost their way so he God sent
[1:09:46] them a god Exodus
[1:09:49] 13:21 something like this I'll send my
[1:09:53] angel before you the pill of fire to
[1:09:57] keep you in the way to guide them to the
[1:10:02] promised land and the children of Israel
[1:10:05] follow that God that Pillar of Fire
[1:10:08] night Cloud by day when it stop they
[1:10:12] stop when it Journey they journey and
[1:10:16] when it got them close to the land and
[1:10:19] they wasn't fit to go over he led them
[1:10:24] back into the wilderness
[1:10:28] my
[1:10:29] my let's investigate a little
[1:10:34] bit as I look at I mean if you see a
[1:10:39] Vindicated Prophet with thus said the
[1:10:41] Lord and they saw the the Red Sea open
[1:10:45] something that they' had never seen
[1:10:46] before the Red Sea
[1:10:48] open all the uh the the the Israelite
[1:10:52] crossed over and then they saw that
[1:10:55] Prophet Moses standing there with the
[1:10:58] Egyptian Army in behind them and they
[1:11:01] knowing not what to do had no idea they
[1:11:05] thought they was going to die you know
[1:11:07] it's an Egyptian Army would get them
[1:11:09] then they would drag them back they
[1:11:10] would kill them and they begin to fear
[1:11:13] but God Amen Moses begin to begin to cry
[1:11:19] and and Moses begin to cry and the
[1:11:20] prophet of God said God be to tell Moses
[1:11:23] why cry speak amen and and I believe the
[1:11:28] same thing today Church of the Living
[1:11:30] God sometime I found we we get to a
[1:11:34] situation we we get to a crossroad and
[1:11:37] we don't know what to do but I'm going
[1:11:39] to tell you brothers and sister it's no
[1:11:41] time to cry it's time to Amen to speak
[1:11:45] amen amen and we can cross over amen
[1:11:49] speak to it amen in the name of the Lord
[1:11:52] Jesus Christ amen and I I think about
[1:11:55] the children of Israel had no idea they
[1:11:57] had three stages of their Journey they
[1:12:00] they had to leave Egypt was the first
[1:12:03] stage they had to go through the
[1:12:04] Wilderness Amen in Cades barer amen the
[1:12:08] second stage and to get to the promised
[1:12:11] Landen now some
[1:12:14] believe uh that the promised land was a
[1:12:18] type uh of the Millennia brother Brandon
[1:12:21] said no it couldn't be because any
[1:12:24] millennium
[1:12:25] they
[1:12:26] rested but when they the children of
[1:12:29] Israel got into the promised land they
[1:12:32] were still Wars there were still battles
[1:12:36] they were still death and the brother
[1:12:38] and sister how many you know we are in
[1:12:40] that Promised Land amen we still having
[1:12:43] battle we still having trials amen amen
[1:12:47] but I thank God he brought us out and I
[1:12:49] thank God he sent an angel in this last
[1:12:52] day to lead us amen all the way amen but
[1:12:56] I think tonight Church of the Living God
[1:12:59] I said now what caused the children of
[1:13:02] Israel to mum and
[1:13:06] complain what caused the people to get
[1:13:10] relaxed what caused them to start
[1:13:13] missing church and start just staying
[1:13:15] home just start losing their desire what
[1:13:19] caused
[1:13:21] that what what what took the the the the
[1:13:25] prayer away what what caused the people
[1:13:28] to get
[1:13:29] discouraged what caused them to cry what
[1:13:32] caused them to get to a place where they
[1:13:36] say they don't need uh Moses anymore
[1:13:40] what what caused that church what caused
[1:13:42] them to say that Moses was false what
[1:13:46] caused the children of Israel to get to
[1:13:47] a place that say let us build us a
[1:13:50] golden calf and we would say that what
[1:13:52] brought us out of Egypt and brother
[1:13:55] sister I believe amen what has caused
[1:13:58] the children of Israel now if you notice
[1:14:00] in Exodus the 13th chapter how that
[1:14:05] Moses by the Commandment of God God told
[1:14:09] Moses to pick 12 men from each tribe and
[1:14:14] there to
[1:14:15] go un the promised
[1:14:18] land to see what it's all about brother
[1:14:21] brand preach a message what is the Holy
[1:14:24] Ghost and what is the Holy Ghost giving
[1:14:26] for brother Brandon said you need to
[1:14:29] know what it is and what is the result
[1:14:33] when you have it how do you know you
[1:14:34] have it a lot of people think that they
[1:14:37] have it and brother Brandon said the
[1:14:39] devil can't deceive a person and they're
[1:14:41] thinking that they have it and really
[1:14:43] they don't have it oh my my oh my so
[1:14:47] that's why in this hour we need to have
[1:14:49] an
[1:14:51] absolute can somebody say Amen we know
[1:14:54] that the prophet of God preach a message
[1:14:56] an absolute an absolute is perfect
[1:14:59] within itself and is Unlimited in its
[1:15:02] power it is an ultimate amen so that's
[1:15:05] what we need in this hour is an
[1:15:08] absolute well Moses Moses brother
[1:15:12] Brandon said God told Moses to piak
[1:15:15] those 12 can you imagine Moses Peak 12
[1:15:19] out of each tribe and they will go down
[1:15:22] to Egypt and they were to bring back
[1:15:25] uh words and and and and they want to
[1:15:28] bring back now brothers and sister I
[1:15:30] want you to realize that Joshua and
[1:15:33] Caleb or none of the other 10 never saw
[1:15:37] the promised land they didn't have a
[1:15:39] clue what the promised land look like
[1:15:42] but Moses by Vision saw the promised
[1:15:46] land and he told them that the land was
[1:15:49] floting with milk and honey oh brother
[1:15:52] and sister amen we had a a a Apostle
[1:15:55] Paul begin to tell us uh um amen about
[1:15:59] heaven but we had a prophet in this age
[1:16:02] he told us what it was like on the other
[1:16:04] side amen so the children of Israel that
[1:16:08] Joshua and Caleb never seen the promised
[1:16:10] land but by faith they fought every inch
[1:16:14] of the way and when they got there
[1:16:16] Church of the Living God they saw the
[1:16:19] land they saw the promise let me tell
[1:16:22] you what church I don't know about you
[1:16:24] but I'm feasted with the King amen I'm
[1:16:27] happy in the Lord amen because God has
[1:16:30] brought us amen we've been led by Angel
[1:16:34] amen and this Angel is ordained to see
[1:16:37] us all the way through oh Church of the
[1:16:39] Living God I'm not going to turn to the
[1:16:42] right I'm not going to turn to the left
[1:16:44] but I'm going to keep my eyes on the
[1:16:46] revealed word of the hour can somebody
[1:16:49] say
[1:16:50] Amen the children of Israel amen the the
[1:16:54] the 12 went over there amen and they saw
[1:16:58] the
[1:17:01] grapes and also they saw the
[1:17:05] Giants but Joshua and Kayla you know
[1:17:08] sometime we we allow cirumstances to get
[1:17:11] in our way I've learned one thing our
[1:17:14] prophet of God says he said there's
[1:17:17] nothing that can happen to a Christian
[1:17:21] that God has an intent yes amen so
[1:17:25] brother Browner said I preach what Paul
[1:17:27] preached now brother Browner Paul said
[1:17:30] in Romans 8 that all things oh my
[1:17:34] brothers and sisters sometime amen
[1:17:37] without a revelation that scripture is
[1:17:39] so baffing sometime you mean to say
[1:17:41] Brothers children all things all things
[1:17:44] can I hear the whole church say all
[1:17:46] things I don't care if I'm down in the
[1:17:49] valley is going to do good for me
[1:17:51] hallelujah thank you Lord I've got to a
[1:17:54] place I've learned to rest in the arm of

[1:18:04] care what I go through I've learned to
[1:18:07] say it's going to work out for my good
[1:18:11] amen why because I'm feasting amen I
[1:18:14] know who I am so all things work
[1:18:17] together for the good but sometime you
[1:18:20] find people that get discouraged in an
[1:18:23] hour and and and and the 10 the 12 gos
[1:18:29] over there and Joshua and Kayla they saw
[1:18:33] the problems they saw the Giants but
[1:18:36] they knew they had a
[1:18:38] promise amen they they knew that they
[1:18:41] was more than able to take that land how
[1:18:44] many you believe that amen how many you

[1:29:04] when God got his hand in it the devil
[1:29:06] might fight but God will make it come to
[1:29:10] pass so that year we we we couldn't move
[1:29:16] but at the appointed time when it was
[1:29:18] time God had the funds there God had
[1:29:21] everything but this what happened

[1:29:43] anointing he said whatsoever you have on
[1:29:45] your heart he said write it down y'all
[1:29:48] hearing me write it down now you said
[1:29:51] well oh I don't know about all that well

[1:30:48] and you know what I did church at the
[1:30:49] Living God I put it in Acts the 19th
[1:30:51] Chapter I closed the book and I went to
[1:30:54] bed I Delight myself in the Lord and I

[1:31:27] hour so I didn't reason I went to sleep
[1:31:30] on that devil that's what some of us
[1:31:32] need to do is go to sleep on that devil
[1:31:35] I turned over yes and the next
[1:31:39] day I got up and doing my choice and I
[1:31:42] know devil he won't quit he said the ey
