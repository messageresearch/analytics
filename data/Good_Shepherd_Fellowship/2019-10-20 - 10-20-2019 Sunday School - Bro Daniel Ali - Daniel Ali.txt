========================================

that he kept watch over us you cast a hedge around us they did not allow the focus of this duck age to take advantage of us in any way we are so grateful Lord that we are gathered before the Father Oh God this morning to think of the week father the past week being a very difficult week for some of us and for us to be here this morning it is purely by your grace and we acknowledge that father this morning will give you the glory Lord we praise the Lord and we worship thee for order have done for us our Lord and our Savior Jesus we are here to worship Lord for the next 30 minutes father our Sunday School kicks in both for the children and for the adults we commit both Sunday schools into your hands this morning Oh God may you open our eyes to see to see something new something that will lift us up further old God and draw us closer unto thee that our walk with you would never be the same open our ears to hear open our hearts father to receive a few this morning bless our host Lord bless something new happen to our life father let something exciting happen to our life do not let our last father or God be boring bless us Lord we pray and we beseech thee father this morning in Jesus name Amen god bless you saints happy to see once again yeah I spoke with brother one last night around around 11 o'clock last night he sends his greetings he said say hi to the family and I believe he was talking about the family of God there is no family that can be compared to this family of ours you know you think of our natural families what makes us a family is because you have the blood of your father mother running through your veins and another person share the same DNA so so this is my brother this is my sister that is in the natural and I come to think of it in the spiritual to have the blood of the Lord Jesus running through our veins and making us we never knew ourselves brothers and sisters I mean it's such a wonderful feeling nothing compares to it and nothing can compare to it you know as a as brother brother I've said that the importance of Revelation can never be overemphasized and jesus told his disciples upon this rock I build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it you know it just sometimes we lose facto certain things we don't grab the spiritual importance of it and we let the revelation of Ages slide under the carpet but I pray God you know to grant us grace to see things much more differently that this family is a superior family that our natural families do not come anywhere close this family that is where we can have so much confidence in one another that things will not even do for our natural brothers and sisters we can do it we can show it among ourselves freely why because the blood of our Redemption my goodness nothing compares the blood that runs through our veins as natural brothers and sisters is wife is is in no way form or shape compared to the blood by which we are redeemed the blood that has United us together praise be to God God bless you all and he says good morning to everyone of you it was a very difficult week for some of us waking 12 hours I'm always up at 2 a.m. I don't come home until somewhere around 3:00 3:30 p.m. and 6 days a week actually as I'm here my colleagues are still working praise be to God they know that my Sunday's are special to me and that I don't work on Sundays that alone is enough for me praise be to God I didn't have to look for somebody to backfill they had to do it and where are the girls I want to do it or not house that was my back case yeah but tangled that message has been made very very clear and they understand it praise be to God I'm happy to be here this morning I forgive me if I engage you in a rat race but I just don't know what is going to happen we are trusting God as something would happen because for every time we gather before him something special happens praise be to God last week we looked at intercessory prayer a lot about intercessory prayer now we're ready for phase 2 multi 2 1 & 2 1 2 3 I don't know if you okay we can first emoti 2 1 first emoji now I exact therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men praise be to God so we talked at length about intercessory prayer and a part of it has to do with standing in the gap for somebody when I cast my mind back to when Moses came from the mountain with the two tablets containing the Ten Commandments and he saw the people worshiping the golden calf and he hit them on the ground and brought them and he still did not catch them he did not catch them even though he was so disappointed and God was so displeased with what went on Moses still stood in the gap when you read the scriptures the Bible says he prayed for them God was so displaced and not only the people God was so displeased with Aaron and would have destroyed him but Moses prayed for error and God made him God was so displeased with what happened and was so displeased with error but God had Moses intercession when you look at how the wrath of God came down upon nature upon how the churn of God tempted God and the wrath of God came down and God wanted to destroy them Moses threw himself in the gap and said no don't do it if you do it our enemies are going to laugh at us they were saying you delivered us where you couldn't get us to the promised land so you have destroyed us don't do it Moses stood in the gap and God respected that and what I have come to realize does sometimes stunning in the gap intercessory prayer what happens is that God is not looking at the person God is looking at you who is standing in the gap praise be to God the fellows healing their fellows deliverance depends on your fate the father doesn't even come into question God was not looking at what a child of Israel did even though he was displeased with it but here was Moses standing in the gap God was looking at Moses God spared him and it comes to that moment that when you are standing in the gap of somebody it's your faith God is looking at it's your faith that is going to put up a central it's your faith that is going to grind up s India healing it's your faith that is going to bring them that deliverance praise be to God we read about the the Centurion last week and I'm Darius from Luke 7 1 to 10 and we said as Saint children had a servant who was so dear to him who was sick to the point of death it was not the servants faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that healed him no it was the Centurion when he said his service to tell a lot Jesus that I am not worried I should come under my roof need account I ready to come to you but just pick mi7 to be made whole praise be to God and Allah jesus said I've not seen this type of it not in Israel and that very moment his servant was made hold we also talked about a self-sufficient woman the brick woman whose daughter was sick and she wanted a lot Jesus and a lot told him it is not me to give that us bread two dogs that did not turn her away she said nevertheless that dogs it from the crumbs that fall from the table that moved him praise be to God it was have faith in the Lord Jesus that healed Hedorah standing in the gap there are things we are all praying for there are people that are so dear to us maybe brothers who are no more in our midst sisters who are no more in our mist maybe our children maybe our parents maybe our husbands our wives whatever there are people that we are holding before God praise be to God do not let your faith a waiver don't look at what they are doing for God is counting on your faith to bring them in praise be to God when I was looking at this around 140 this morning a lot of things came to my matter how to just get up and write them down before I forget but it looks very much like are we putting that in somewhere next week God willing there is something I want to get to today and I'm trusting God with the limited time we have that God is going to help us and to see us through praise beauty God now whatever you set your mind on to do for God do not let anything distract you even in the natural if you find somebody today I want to be this tomorrow he lives that I want to be this one and then he lives this I want to be this else they'll go through life without achieving anything but when somebody decided this is what I want to do regardless of the obstacles they may fall here and right there and if they never give up and they continue to persist the end of achieving it whatever requests you have before God don't abandon it I don't care what request you have before God what I want to pray for keep trusting God hold on never throw in the towel tightness is not our portion there is a saying that if someone is chasing something is running after you and that tin is not tired you that is running away should never complain of tightness praise be to God James for three James for three I already have it here don't need to open my Bible you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts and there are two things I want us to look at you ask amiss what does it mean to ask amiss I try to find out from the additional and it means that we don't ask quite right and then our requests are sometimes inappropriate and then out of place just imagine I I don't have any science background and then when I go to bed when I go on my knees to pray I tell God I want to go go on a space walk I want to go in a space mission I first said I pray telling God I want to go on a space mission I want to walk on the moon just think about it it's very inappropriate it's out of place I'm askin amis our God is a miracle worker we believe in miracles our God is not a magician so sometimes the things we ask outrageous they are simply out of place so we ask amiss that we may consume it upon our lusts so here motive comes in motive comes in you may ask right back with a wrong motive it's 110 ask a right with a good motive let's say there is nothing wrong with asking for wisdom because the Bible says ask for wisdom in a book of prophets for seven the Bible says wisdom is the principal thing therefore seek it wisdom now if I go to God asking for wisdom I am asking for something good talking of the wisdom of men because the book of first Corinthians says that I come to you not with the enticing words of man's wisdom I am NOT talking of the wisdom of men that can grow wings that can get so pompous that can get so proud no that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about the wisdom of God that wisdom of God brings humility it humbles you praise be to God now so there is nothing wrong with asking for wisdom but if I am asking for wisdom because I I want to prove to everybody that I am the wisest I'll prove to a better a sister know that I'm better than you or I understands it better than you I am even - I'm asking for something good it's on a wrong premises the motive behind my requests is wrong but when you ask right and your motive is right God is bound to answer the prayer praise be to God you say oh brother I have been praying praying praying asking this it's right my motive is right yet I have not seen any result keep holding on keep holding on if the motive is right keep holding on if what you're asking is right keep holding on this calls for patients with God most of the times that is what we lack we've already talked about these things even though we are where we are a revision week we are not going to go back to it now can I just touch it here and there as we go patients in your walk with God is very important never lose sight of that keep holding on and never give a praise be to God and now sometimes our Prius earns it but we don't get to realize that our prayers are answered because we go to God and we pray and in the back of our minds we expect God to come in a special way of course we don't map a strategy for God God can choose any way he wants to do his thing but sometimes we decide for God how God should come and how God's you answer our prayer the time he should come in he should come at 12:00 midday he should come wearing a long rope and then he should come speak him like somebody I mean we cannot do all that and then we miss it when God comes and when God answers our prayer there was a sister who went to prayer and I he spoke to God he said I have lived for you all my life I have cept you I have been faithful the best way I know I have had a lot about you but I have never set eyes on you I want to see you dear Lord Jesus I am going to prepare your food and I want you to come and eat that food and as she went to the market and then she went and shopped but her ingredients bought food and whatnot she came and she prepared the food and when it was ready she said the table and as she prayed say Lord Jesus your food is ready I'm waiting for you to come and eat this food and then she was sitting down just waiting waiting waiting then somebody knocks at the door then she jumps off rest to the door opens the door and I was this little man old man standing in front of the door with his hair so bushy what is beard hanging not very well-dressed and then he greeted her hello yes what do you want she couldn't even respond to the greetings yes what do you want it's a please can I get some water to drink and then she looked at him for a while wondering do I have a cup in this house for somebody like this and then she went up in the cabinet oh the glasses that way they she didn't find any cup for that man then she remembered she had a rubber cup a drinking cup plastic one some way and then she went and took it she could not even get him water from the fridge the refrigerator she wanted a pump open the faucet just filled a cup and brought it to this man and a man took it drank it I said thank you and as she took the cup when the man left she threw it in the trash the man left she was there waiting waiting waiting nothing happened she went to bed and then she prayed daeul oh jesus you disappointed me I prayed I prepared your food I asked you to come and eat and you never showed up there right in the dream I mean she went to she went to bed and she had a dream and in the dream the Lord said I came but you never accepted me you called me you invited me to come and eat I came and you turn me away that is how it there are some times we pray and we ask for teens God does them God answers our prayer but we have a picture in our minds of how we want things to be that even though God has answered our prayer and a prayer is screaming so loud the other screaming so loud I am here your place and said yes we paid left years to it why because in our minds we have something we have it already designed the way it should be it ought not to be so a child of God you should know when be sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit know when God is in control and if you cannot test that God is in control let go of the steering wheel because you know praise be to God wonderful that nothing can go wrong so a lot of the ways God answers our prayer and yet we don't see it in a message believe in God their prophet said is and I want to read it and I notice that some of us have more faith than others and those who have abundance of faith are supposed to pray for those so if you have faith this is again bringing us back to intercessory prayer is bringing us back to standing in the gap for one another is so so so important never overlook it never look down on it if you can stand in the gap for a brother for a sister forever depend if you can just turn and your faith does not waver God is going to honor your faith and things will begin to happen in the life of that person praise be to God but you don't leave but if you don't live right if you don't leave the right kind of life you better live away from it the devil would laugh at your prayer but when you live right and do right and act right and have faith in God Satan will tremble when you speak because God swore on the obligation he would take care of that prayer and that is true praise be to God so the life you live also matters there is power in the life you live their life you live we have said that time and again and we can never overemphasize that that you don't profess 1:10 and your life it's something else live in the word pray in the word work in the word whatever you want to do make sure you are standing in the world praise be to God so the life you are living also matters the Prophet said else the devil will laugh at your prayer but if the life is right when you go on your knees to pray the devil trembles praise be to God now in this message be led by the spirit now what did I tell you last night this was in Germany the prophet of God prayed for a lady with greater when the life is gone out it has to shrink now sister there'll be like that for three days and three nights it may get worse then don't worry that's a sign you are healed just keep giving praise to God when I come back to Germany come and testify praise be to God in the message what shall I do with Jesus call Christ I'm just a few minutes away let me chip this in well this was making the little woman get worse many times I explained it if you get worse does the very sign that you are healed praise be to God I may not be able to read all this I may reserve a part of it for next week my time is almost up you know sometimes and I remember last you remember the one was preaching he said for you to get beautiful it has to get ugly praise be to God so there is beauty in ugliness maybe your pain level is one and then after you are being prayed for it elevates from one all the way to nine so what it was very driven prayer for me know you have spoiled your testimony once you say that you have wrecked your testimony when the pain level goes up when tears get West the prophet of God is saying that that is a sign that you are healed praise be to God you know what for about three four weeks now whenever I go to the Lord was just occasion mind my prayer has changed I read a tongue God for healing hey I'm not saying when you go don't crater go see Hill hey if that is the way that's bit of godless you go ahead do it but I'm saying me I believe God has healed her already I believe it with all my I'm not prophesying this is where I stand then when I go to God I just don't go for healing Hey praise be to God that sometimes when you are being prayed for the situation gets worse it gets so terrible neverforget the prophet of God is saying that is a sign you are healed and keep holding on there is something else by the grace of God we'll look at it maybe we will take this a little before we get in next week I was not actually planning this everything I said today I was looking at something and then I just didn't know somehow this thing came in I believe it was for a good reason praise be to God shall we go to the Lord in prayer our Lord and our Bastide Jesus we find you so much for your grace is sufficient for us Wayne thank you so much dear Lord Jesus that your love for us has no bounds Wayne thank you that your mercies are new every morning we are so grateful Lord Jesus that we are seated before you this morning Oh God to worship your
