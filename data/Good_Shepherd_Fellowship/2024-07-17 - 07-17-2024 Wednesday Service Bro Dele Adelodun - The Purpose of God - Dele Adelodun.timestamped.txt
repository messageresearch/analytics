[55:57] in the course of my being here amen I
[56:00] want to thank
[56:02] uh everybody once again for encouraging
[56:06] us with your
[56:08] presence uh yesterday we drove some two
[56:11] hours to visit a
[56:14] brother and uh two hours to two hours
[56:18] from and uh for me it shows some sort of
[56:23] sacrifice uh people make to come today
[56:26] the house of the Lord amen some of you
[56:29] there was a time we went to Mayo Clinic
[56:31] area and it was uh kind of a distance
[56:35] also yes sister Nami we've been
[56:38] there and it was uh some sort of a
[56:41] distance also so that also gave an
[56:44] impression of the length people go to
[56:48] make it to the house of the Lord indeed
[56:51] where the carass is the Eagles will be
[56:53] gathered nothing will prevent an eagle
[56:56] of God uh from reaching out for ease or
[56:59] our food so thank you all for coming
[57:02] again tonight your coming I want you to
[57:04] know is an encouragement and may the
[57:08] Lord bless you for your sacrifices and
[57:12] uh I've enjoyed so much care since I
[57:15] came and uh I want to thank all the
[57:18] masam and the
[57:19] aunties uh uh one of them brought food
[57:22] for us this afternoon so we're just
[57:24] jamming food upon food
[57:27] we've never had a lack last Sunday we're
[57:30] taking for a very good lunch and the
[57:32] pastor's household have been also doing
[57:35] wonderfully I'm feeling the weight of
[57:37] your ministry already in my
[57:40] body it's been very physically edifying
[57:44] and I pray that the Lord will bless you
[57:46] uh bless every one of you my brother who
[57:49] picked me at the airport and everybody
[57:52] who's done one thing or the other amen
[57:54] if you have a chance to come to Nigeria
[57:57] sister cassete does not want to come to
[57:59] Nigeria I hope she repents of that she
[58:02] said she's happy for me to be coming but
[58:04] not for her to come over isn't isn't
[58:07] that a partial uh Arrangement anyway
[58:11] have been faithful to mine I hope you be
[58:13] you will rise up one day but anytime you
[58:17] have the opportunity to come by us uh it
[58:20] doesn't get too cold for us to attend to
[58:23] you neither does it get too late feel
[58:25] free anytime
[58:26] uh we'll do all we can to make you uh as
[58:31] comfortable as we could in our own
[58:32] little way so the Lord bless you very
[58:35] much I trust to God I'll will see you
[58:37] again uh and I don't think there's any
[58:40] doubt about that because we are related
[58:44] about 10 11 months ago when I came I
[58:46] said we shall see again and God has made
[58:48] it possible we are seeing again amen so
[58:51] I trust to God he will give us another
[58:53] appointment and if he comes before that
[58:56] time we miss nothing so if we don't see
[58:58] here we see hope there that's very
[59:01] certain so may the Lord keep you healthy
[59:04] keep you strong keep you happy serving
[59:06] the lord uh till we meet again God bless
[59:10] you thank you Pastor for this privilege
[59:13] I appreciate every bit of it God bless
[59:15] you amen all right tonight I just
[59:19] thought we will
[59:20] speak and something God put upon my
[59:23] heart but uh because it's a midweek
[59:25] service I may not be able to go to the
[59:28] length uh of it but I trust it will give
[59:32] us enough out of it amen uh to be able
[59:36] to take something home that will help us
[59:38] in our journey here so tonight I want to
[59:41] speak on the purpose of God Amen the
[59:45] purpose of
[59:47] God and
[59:50] uh this subject I look at it in two
[59:54] ways one is the purpose of
[59:59] God and the other is a purpose for
[1:00:04] God broadly speaking there are two
[1:00:07] category of people on the
[1:00:09] Earth and uh each category belong to a
[1:00:13] site of this there are those who are
[1:00:18] serving the purpose of
[1:00:21] God and there's those who are serving a
[1:00:24] purpose for
[1:00:27] God they are the ones the people serving
[1:00:30] the purpose for God are the one who
[1:00:32] makes
[1:00:34] necessary for
[1:00:36] God to do certain things in the life of
[1:00:39] those who are serving the purpose of
[1:00:43] God it will be clear as we go along amen
[1:00:48] amen the prophet in the message Christ
[1:00:51] is the mystery of God
[1:00:53] revealed he said God has a three-fold
[1:00:57] purpose amen and it said one the first
[1:01:01] is to reveal
[1:01:04] himself and in order to reveal himself
[1:01:07] the entire spirit being called God
[1:01:10] because God is a spirit don't forget
[1:01:13] amen out to prepare a body for himself
[1:01:17] and express himself in human
[1:01:21] flesh because there's no other way for
[1:01:24] God to reveal himself than to become
[1:01:27] tangible so the tangibility of God was
[1:01:30] Jesus Christ amen and that is why
[1:01:34] because it has to be a full revelation
[1:01:36] of God himself the fullness of God Earth
[1:01:39] has to do what come into that
[1:01:42] body you have God in measures but our
[1:01:47] Lord has him in fullness that is why
[1:01:50] when Philip said show us the father and
[1:01:51] it will suffice he said for this long
[1:01:55] that I've been with you you you don't
[1:01:56] know me Philip could have said Master
[1:01:59] you got it wrong I know you but I want
[1:02:01] to know the father amen but there is no
[1:02:04] other way the father could be declared
[1:02:06] than through the body called
[1:02:08] Christ because if it comes here as a
[1:02:10] spirit nobody will see him amen will not
[1:02:14] know his nature will will not know the
[1:02:15] way he works his manners so Christ came
[1:02:18] to humanize deity for all of us so that
[1:02:22] we can see who God actually is but you
[1:02:26] see this is a deep
[1:02:28] Revelation Meant For Those whom it is
[1:02:31] meant
[1:02:33] for because it is only those who
[1:02:36] actually received the revelation of him
[1:02:40] that can submit to his
[1:02:45] preeminence you must know God for who he
[1:02:47] is in order for you to be fully
[1:02:50] submissive to
[1:02:51] him one of the reasons they crucified
[1:02:54] Christ for in the Bible was that they
[1:02:58] said he being man maketh himself God did
[1:03:02] you catch that in other words they
[1:03:04] couldn't come to terms with the fact
[1:03:06] that this guy Apprentice Carpenter
[1:03:11] boy that they gave their stool their
[1:03:13] chairs to repair some years back could
[1:03:17] come back and say he is the geover of
[1:03:20] the whole
[1:03:21] Testament brother Braham said that's a
[1:03:24] super sign
[1:03:26] Jehovah God crawled like a baby on the
[1:03:30] floor maybe when he was craw crawling as
[1:03:33] a baby he must have picked some death on
[1:03:35] the floor and Mama must have tapped the
[1:03:36] hand I said I've told you not to be
[1:03:38] picking death some people witnessed that
[1:03:41] when Jesus was
[1:03:43] growing some people saw him todle some
[1:03:47] people saw him you know struggling to
[1:03:49] take a step they saw him eventually
[1:03:52] walking they saw him when he will go
[1:03:55] with Father Joseph to his carpentry or
[1:03:58] Furniture designer
[1:04:00] workshop and they saw him learning
[1:04:03] measurements and everything so how this
[1:04:05] could now amount to God was too much for
[1:04:08] many people amen but all those things
[1:04:11] makes it a super sign yes are you
[1:04:15] catching it in the message taken side
[1:04:17] with Jesus the prophet said no matter
[1:04:19] what anybody has got to say about Christ
[1:04:22] those who will believe him will still
[1:04:24] believe him
[1:04:27] are you a Believer tonight amen is there
[1:04:30] anything that can tell you contrary
[1:04:32] about Christ that can make you change
[1:04:33] your Bel in him oh your the womb of your
[1:04:36] mind is sealed to him
[1:04:39] already Hallelujah there is a reason for
[1:04:42] that amen so he's going to reveal
[1:04:46] himself amen those for whom this
[1:04:49] Revelation is ordained church because it
[1:04:52] is not for
[1:04:54] everybody and that that was why when
[1:04:56] Christ when he came in flesh the Bible
[1:04:58] said he was speaking parables in the
[1:05:01] open but in the closet he will dissect
[1:05:04] The Parables and make it so plain he did
[1:05:08] it so much until even the disciples took
[1:05:10] notes they said sir how come when we are
[1:05:13] outside you were always talking in
[1:05:17] Proverbs and you didn't care whether
[1:05:19] anybody was offended or not so as to
[1:05:22] even explain better you never bothered
[1:05:25] but when we come in here without we
[1:05:29] soliciting without we begging for it you
[1:05:32] will sit us down and be expounding The
[1:05:36] Parables they ask him as a question you
[1:05:38] know what he answered he said unto you
[1:05:41] it is given yes that's right thank so
[1:05:46] the Lord by that showed that am to whom
[1:05:49] he will revelate reveal himself to his
[1:05:51] Sovereign he is Sovereign in that nobody
[1:05:54] can challenge him nobody can tell him
[1:05:56] who to show or who not to show he does
[1:05:59] that out of his own free will and he
[1:06:01] chooses is selective about those whom he
[1:06:04] give his
[1:06:06] revelation we see that clearly from the
[1:06:09] scripture so it is not everybody that we
[1:06:12] have the revelation of Jesus Christ it
[1:06:15] is only a certain category of people and
[1:06:18] why is he unveiling himself to them
[1:06:21] Isaiah said all your children oh Lord
[1:06:23] shall be taught by you yes all the
[1:06:26] children of God will be taught by God
[1:06:28] the prophet said God does not have
[1:06:30] obligation to teach kain's children
[1:06:34] Revelation so he has obligation only to
[1:06:37] his own children you know why because
[1:06:41] they have a purpose to
[1:06:43] serve that's
[1:06:46] right so he will reveal himself by that
[1:06:50] Revelation he will have
[1:06:53] preeminence they will come to a point
[1:06:55] point that they will not be able to do
[1:06:58] anything except what he
[1:07:00] says in the message the Holy Spirit gave
[1:07:04] to the prophet to write he said those in
[1:07:06] the bright do only his will yes nothing
[1:07:09] can make them do otherwise they either
[1:07:12] get dust say the Lord or they keep
[1:07:17] still by their Divine chemistry they are
[1:07:19] not designed to hear the voice of a
[1:07:23] stranger they are not designed to be Be
[1:07:25] Inspired or pushed by the by a stranger
[1:07:28] they only listen to One
[1:07:31] Voice Because by the revelation of
[1:07:34] Christ to them Christ has taken
[1:07:36] preeminence the revelation of God sealed
[1:07:39] their womb they can listen to no other
[1:07:42] that is preeminence so they listen to
[1:07:44] only one person and that is Jesus Christ
[1:07:48] and by that preeminence they will be
[1:07:50] restored
[1:07:52] back to the original beginning where men
[1:07:55] fell from so Christ has a three-fold
[1:07:59] purpose one to reveal himself two to
[1:08:02] have
[1:08:03] preeminence in the life of Those whom he
[1:08:05] revealed himself to and by that
[1:08:08] preeminence three to restore them back
[1:08:10] to
[1:08:11] Eden our original beginning where we
[1:08:14] fell from those who enjoyed those three
[1:08:18] articles of purpose or Revelation they
[1:08:21] are the one who are in the purpose of
[1:08:24] God
[1:08:28] they are the one for whom all things
[1:08:30] work together for good when the Bible
[1:08:33] said all things work together for good
[1:08:36] he made a caveat not for
[1:08:38] everybody he said to them that love the
[1:08:41] Lord to them who are de
[1:08:44] called something must call
[1:08:47] you brother Braham said music call some
[1:08:50] people amen the need for connection
[1:08:53] brought some people some wanted uh
[1:08:57] Society some wanted somewhere to belong
[1:08:59] brought some people he said but the only
[1:09:02] call that will ever last is a called by
[1:09:04] the word of
[1:09:05] God and he said those who may call by
[1:09:08] the word are already in him before the
[1:09:11] foundation of the world so when the word
[1:09:13] calls them they only responding to what
[1:09:16] they
[1:09:17] are and that is why Heaven and Earth may
[1:09:20] pass away nothing will shake their feet
[1:09:23] they will remain permanently they can
[1:09:25] never leave amen no matter how H it gets
[1:09:28] they will stay no matter how freezing
[1:09:31] cold it gets they will stay amen weather
[1:09:34] does not tamper with their commitment it
[1:09:37] doesn't tamper with their devotion amen
[1:09:40] that is why Paul said what shall
[1:09:41] separate us from is is in that same
[1:09:44] chapter from the love of God he
[1:09:46] mentioned everything that could happen
[1:09:48] to human being as a vile as evil he said
[1:09:51] but nay in all these things we are what
[1:09:55] mother than conqueror to them serving
[1:09:58] God is not
[1:10:00] transactional if I pay you this you must
[1:10:02] give me this that's transaction amen for
[1:10:06] them whether they get something out of
[1:10:08] it listen to me church or they got
[1:10:10] nothing out of it they keep serving the
[1:10:13] lord
[1:10:15] amen they know that God can do all
[1:10:18] things yes but they also know that God
[1:10:20] may not may choose not to do all he can
[1:10:23] do and still it will wouldn't affect
[1:10:25] their devotion you are not getting
[1:10:28] me amen the three Hebrew children said
[1:10:31] told Nebuchadnezzar he said oh King live
[1:10:34] forever amen as for this matter we are
[1:10:36] not careful in other word we are not
[1:10:38] afraid but at the same time we are not
[1:10:40] arrogant but we are not afraid to tell
[1:10:43] you our position we will tell you very
[1:10:45] excuse me very nicely and whether you
[1:10:47] toss us up and down 50 times it will be
[1:10:50] the same answer we are not going to bow
[1:10:53] down
[1:10:55] your
[1:10:57] image what informs your boldness we know
[1:11:01] our God can deliver us but wait a minute
[1:11:04] prayer if he chooses not to deliver us
[1:11:08] yet we shall still not bow
[1:11:10] down in other word whether it pays us or
[1:11:14] it does not pay
[1:11:15] us our devotion our answer is the same
[1:11:21] that's right they understood God's
[1:11:23] sovereignty amen amen so to them it's
[1:11:27] beyond bread and butter
[1:11:29] Christianity amen so what they have and
[1:11:32] what do do not have does not tamper with
[1:11:35] their faithfulness with their Devotion
[1:11:36] to God are you catching it yes those
[1:11:39] guys are in the purpose of God because
[1:11:42] they received a PE of great priz
[1:11:45] something what brought them into God's
[1:11:48] economy is greater to them than
[1:11:51] anything that life could afford you love
[1:11:54] him amen
[1:11:57] now I'm just showing you Redemption
[1:11:59] story in another
[1:12:01] way this revelation of
[1:12:04] God to have preeminence and to restore
[1:12:08] you is the entire Redemption story but
[1:12:11] guess what who facilitated it
[1:12:19] Satan it's a story you all know and I'll
[1:12:22] bring it from there I'll bring it from
[1:12:24] The Exodus
[1:12:27] it was the devil that makes the
[1:12:29] revelation of Christ of God
[1:12:31] possible because what is the essence of
[1:12:34] God becoming flesh you will say in order
[1:12:37] to come and redeem man isn't it yes why
[1:12:40] did man need a Redemption because he
[1:12:42] fell because he fell amen who occasioned
[1:12:45] the fall it was Satan yes are you
[1:12:48] catching it so Satan did a purpose for
[1:12:52] God when you see people who whom God
[1:12:55] used and yet they do not benefit from
[1:12:59] the blessings of that use they are just
[1:13:02] having a purpose for God
[1:13:06] Amen are you catching it yes the prophet
[1:13:09] said when Satan has brought to pass that
[1:13:12] which was necessary to the purpose of
[1:13:16] God he brought the fall that make the
[1:13:19] Redeemer necessary isn't it that make
[1:13:21] the Healer necessary that make the
[1:13:23] Savior necessary that make the
[1:13:25] Deliverance necessary but did he himself
[1:13:27] partake in the blessings of the Redeemer
[1:13:29] no did he partake in the blessings of
[1:13:31] the Savior did he partakes in the
[1:13:33] blessings of the deliverer did he get
[1:13:35] the blessings of the Healer no but he
[1:13:38] facilitated the reason for which Christ
[1:13:40] will become
[1:13:42] flesh so he served a purpose for
[1:13:47] God but those who partake in all those
[1:13:51] blessings they are the one in the
[1:13:53] purpose of God brother Braham said
[1:13:56] atonement does not start from body
[1:13:59] healing he said the beginning of
[1:14:01] atonement is the healing of your soul
[1:14:03] yes he said that is why he said if it
[1:14:06] can save your soul it can heal your body
[1:14:10] are you catching it so if you are
[1:14:12] getting the lesser lesser teeth beat and
[1:14:14] you are
[1:14:15] flying the real essence of Christ coming
[1:14:18] in flesh is to bring you back to sunship
[1:14:20] yes is to bring you back to daughter the
[1:14:24] prophet said if you meet miss that
[1:14:25] purpose you have missed the mark So when
[1:14:28] you are being brought back to sunship it
[1:14:30] is the evidence that you are the one in
[1:14:32] the purpose of God but the process that
[1:14:35] facilitated it is a purpose for
[1:14:38] God okay let me take you another example
[1:14:42] amen it will be clearer
[1:14:44] now how many ever read in the Bible when
[1:14:47] it said for this cause did that raise
[1:14:49] Pharaoh
[1:14:51] yes have you read it like that in the
[1:14:54] Bible brother Braham said I think it was
[1:14:56] in the Lamb's Book when he was talking
[1:14:58] about the book of life that he even said
[1:15:00] Pharaoh really has no original record it
[1:15:03] was just brought in for certain yes okay
[1:15:05] thank you all right they catching it now
[1:15:08] for this cause did I raise Pharaoh what
[1:15:11] was the cause Rose Pharaoh the Bible
[1:15:14] said a pharaoh that knew not the
[1:15:15] blessings of Joseph arose and did what
[1:15:19] and start bringing oppression that makes
[1:15:21] esod do Redemption necessary amen did
[1:15:24] you you C that now the people who
[1:15:27] partook in that Redemption who were
[1:15:30] brought out and eventually brought into
[1:15:33] the economy of the promise because the
[1:15:36] prophet said Redemption has two parts
[1:15:39] being brought out of somewhere and being
[1:15:42] brought into somewhere amen between
[1:15:44] being brought out and being brought in
[1:15:46] there may be a ping process to take out
[1:15:48] every unbelief so that in your settling
[1:15:51] down you are settling down for good amen
[1:15:53] now the people who have that blessings
[1:15:56] we are in the purpose of God but Pharaoh
[1:15:59] that made it necessary was only serving
[1:16:02] a purpose for
[1:16:04] God so those are the two side of
[1:16:07] purposes in life and each of us is on
[1:16:11] one side but I hope I'm speaking to the
[1:16:14] crowd to decide who are in the purpose
[1:16:17] of God praise the Lord amen now I'm
[1:16:21] elaborating this so that you see
[1:16:25] believer is PED by the
[1:16:28] word there are certain things or certain
[1:16:31] people that will do things in your
[1:16:34] life and because of the bitterness of
[1:16:38] experience you get from there you are
[1:16:40] want to hold it against
[1:16:43] them but when you receive messages like
[1:16:46] this it will help you to liberate
[1:16:48] yourself you know when you tie people
[1:16:50] down you actually the one tied
[1:16:52] down you don't know okay let me give you
[1:16:55] simple scripture Jesus said if you
[1:16:57] forgive I will forgive you it's a simple
[1:17:00] mathematics in the
[1:17:01] Bible how many ever read
[1:17:04] it and to underscore it he even gave you
[1:17:06] a parable he said I was a servant praise
[1:17:10] God Amen who loves the Lord tonight amen
[1:17:14] he said there was a servant who was hold
[1:17:17] who hold his master let's say
[1:17:21] $100 and the master said you go get that
[1:17:23] guy and detain him for me
[1:17:25] and the man came and was begging Master
[1:17:28] have mercy upon me I'm really working at
[1:17:31] paying this thing if you put me in
[1:17:33] prison my family is in trouble I'll be
[1:17:35] demobilized I won't even be able to
[1:17:37] raise the money just have mercy in your
[1:17:40] own heart of art forgive me use your
[1:17:42] church
[1:17:44] art your church mind and the master
[1:17:47] looked at him he said you know what
[1:17:50] write off the money let him go free oh
[1:17:53] he felt so free
[1:17:55] he felt so great but this guy is a
[1:17:59] wicked guy
[1:18:01] yes I used that word Wicked because that
[1:18:04] was what the master called
[1:18:06] him you know as he was going out he saw
[1:18:09] his own colleague servant who hold him
[1:18:12] $10 and guess what he committed the guy
[1:18:15] to prison till he might be able to pay
[1:18:17] that
[1:18:17] $10 and some folks who felt that this
[1:18:20] thing is this picture is not looking
[1:18:22] right started grumbling and Grumble got
[1:18:25] to the master and the master said what
[1:18:28] am I hearing go call that guy for
[1:18:30] me said I forgave you 100 you couldn't
[1:18:35] let go of 10 you are a wicked guy and
[1:18:39] you know what the master did he withdrew
[1:18:41] his own
[1:18:43] pardon because this guy couldn't
[1:18:46] forgive are you catching it yeah he
[1:18:49] withdrew his own pardon and committed
[1:18:51] him to prison till he will be able to
[1:18:53] pay the money so it's a simple principle
[1:18:57] if you
[1:18:58] forgive you will be forgiven brother
[1:19:00] Braham said we will go to a point in our
[1:19:02] Christian experience that we don't feel
[1:19:05] ought or we don't get ought again no
[1:19:08] matter what anybody does we try to rise
[1:19:11] above the
[1:19:13] pain that is our Mark of I call in
[1:19:16] French and it is the wedge that will
[1:19:19] bring you to such a stature that is why
[1:19:21] you need to hear things like this and
[1:19:24] believer must start seeing goodness in
[1:19:28] every
[1:19:30] adversity amen no matter what anybody
[1:19:33] does Amen look away from the person
[1:19:37] Hallelujah if Steven never looked away
[1:19:40] from Saul it will CA
[1:19:43] all but the prophet said he looked at
[1:19:46] the right place yes and when he looked
[1:19:48] at the right place I the Bible said he
[1:19:50] saw heaven opened yeah my goodness look
[1:19:53] at the right place brother brother look
[1:19:55] at the right place sister you will see
[1:19:57] the vision of God the Bible said he saw
[1:20:00] heaven open you think Heaven opened for
[1:20:02] nothing there was a conversation going
[1:20:07] on God was showing him look that guy
[1:20:11] even though don't be carried away by his
[1:20:14] Veil even though he's a soul but there's
[1:20:17] a pole inside amen do not say things or
[1:20:20] do things that will hinder his
[1:20:22] manifestation just speak peace and
[1:20:25] because Steven had tasted the pardon of
[1:20:27] God he was born under the impression of
[1:20:31] forgiveness oh my right I think you have
[1:20:34] to preach that amen you say uh when you
[1:20:39] are been born whatever your mama uttered
[1:20:43] as in the Hebrew mothers now the prophet
[1:20:45] said what their mamas uttered in their
[1:20:48] birth positionally please those children
[1:20:51] and follow them in life amen it's a
[1:20:54] principle
[1:20:56] so I advise mothers all the time when
[1:20:58] you expecting or those who will expect
[1:21:00] when that hour come I actually do not
[1:21:03] know the pains I agree but what I want
[1:21:06] you to do is in the eat of that pain
[1:21:09] never speak anything negative you know
[1:21:12] the prophet said even though it's a
[1:21:13] natural birth yet there's a spiritual
[1:21:16] element He said that is why no matter
[1:21:19] how Wicked a woman is when she's nearing
[1:21:21] at delivery she Mellows down in spirit
[1:21:24] because an Angelic being is overing
[1:21:26] around a spirit is overing around
[1:21:28] waiting to vent life into the baby that
[1:21:31] is to be born so that Spirit
[1:21:36] conditions so it is all together not the
[1:21:39] physical bed there's a supernatural
[1:21:41] element to that delivery that is why you
[1:21:44] must be careful what you
[1:21:45] say because the prophet said what the
[1:21:48] Hebrew mother said followed those
[1:21:51] Patriarchs so much so that when they got
[1:21:53] to the land of
[1:21:55] the lands were divided by what their mam
[1:21:59] uttered so the utterances of their mom
[1:22:02] became their
[1:22:03] Destiny come on
[1:22:06] church we have a mom too you
[1:22:10] know you do you know we have a mom yeah
[1:22:13] you don't know our
[1:22:16] mommy now you sing is everything is
[1:22:18] everything to me don't you sing that is
[1:22:21] my father my mother my sister and my my
[1:22:24] brother is everything to me who are you
[1:22:27] referring to the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:22:31] and the Bible called him El Shai the
[1:22:34] meaning of el Shai is the breasted one
[1:22:36] you don't use the breasted one for a man
[1:22:39] that is the motherhood of
[1:22:42] God praise the Lord so on the cross of
[1:22:45] Calvary he gave birth to you and I
[1:22:47] brother brah said he took us all to the
[1:22:50] Cross amen Gethsemane was the labor room
[1:22:53] Calvary was delivery room and you were
[1:22:56] born under cerian Section Hallelujah so
[1:23:00] surgery is not bad after
[1:23:04] all the the Roman soldier thought we
[1:23:07] wanted to do an orthopedic surgery he
[1:23:09] went to carry Hammer to break the word
[1:23:12] that have been spoken by David some 7
[1:23:14] 800 years ago he thought God's words
[1:23:17] expired Amen brother Braham said behind
[1:23:20] every statement of God he allocates a
[1:23:22] power and he goes to rest when the
[1:23:24] appointed time for that word to come to
[1:23:26] pass is AR he said the power behind the
[1:23:29] word will wake it up Hallelujah this is
[1:23:32] how I know every promise is valid is
[1:23:36] active and is relevant to those who can
[1:23:40] call Jesus on the
[1:23:45] scene he picked up the hammer and they
[1:23:48] went for the first Chief Thief they
[1:23:50] broke the legs the reason they could
[1:23:52] break the leg of the thieves was because
[1:23:54] because there was no promise contrary to
[1:23:56] that amen but of Jesus the Bible said
[1:24:00] not one bone of his body shall be broken
[1:24:03] and no matter how much the devil tried
[1:24:06] he would't break it yes he thought
[1:24:08] because Christ has passed out on the
[1:24:10] cross his words have also passed out oh
[1:24:14] the strength of Israel can never lie
[1:24:17] neither can he fail the moment they
[1:24:19] brought the armor to Jesus the word came
[1:24:21] alive and said dumb Soldier drop that
[1:24:24] Hammer whose leg do you want to break
[1:24:27] the word
[1:24:28] himself drop the hammer we are not doing
[1:24:31] orthopedic surgery here we are doing
[1:24:34] cerian
[1:24:36] section it's a
[1:24:38] delivery amen not a traumatic orthopedic
[1:24:43] surgery and the guy dropped the hammer
[1:24:46] and he picked the spear amen and the
[1:24:49] Lord told him go for his side left side
[1:24:53] right below his heart because the one
[1:24:55] coming is going to be his love
[1:24:57] part glory to God he going to be dear
[1:25:01] and close to his AR that is the one
[1:25:04] [Applause]
[1:25:07] coming and like the sergeon we use that
[1:25:10] needle point to open and cut the Flesh
[1:25:14] and you know separate the layers this
[1:25:17] was done and the birth experience
[1:25:19] started happening blood water came out
[1:25:22] and guess what who came out I came out
[1:25:25] yes sir you came out because the word
[1:25:28] must be fulfilled except the cor of we
[1:25:31] dies and he's buried he abided alone but
[1:25:35] if he's died buried and rotten is going
[1:25:37] to come up whereas one Jesus were killed
[1:25:41] many jesuses came out of the one that
[1:25:43] was killed several seeds of Conn from
[1:25:46] the only one that was
[1:25:47] planted glory to
[1:25:50] God when our mama was given birth to us
[1:25:54] before she passed out on the cross what
[1:25:57] was he
[1:25:58] saying the pastor is in the spirit
[1:26:01] father forgive them for they know not
[1:26:04] what they were so you were born under
[1:26:07] the birth pain utterance of forgiveness
[1:26:09] so you cannot TR be born again by Christ
[1:26:13] and not have a forgiven Spirit if you
[1:26:16] lack it you will tell us who your mama
[1:26:20] is so meaning forgiveness will be a
[1:26:23] natural
[1:26:26] to those who are born again God's
[1:26:28] believing children there will be nothing
[1:26:30] too hard for them not to forgive and
[1:26:34] that is why Fellowship is easy to flow
[1:26:36] among Believers amen that is why
[1:26:38] Believers Are Not Afraid in the
[1:26:41] congregation of Believers because they
[1:26:43] know if they step on toes they will get
[1:26:46] forgiveness amen oh man I pray the Lord
[1:26:49] will multiply it at a revelation to you
[1:26:53] amen whether some somebody even
[1:26:54] deliberately does it or not it doesn't
[1:26:57] matter to the believer amen because he
[1:27:00] looking at the greater picture so when
[1:27:03] Steven was looking up there God was
[1:27:05] interceding for Paul and that was why he
[1:27:09] said Lord lay it not to their
[1:27:12] charge I mean you look at Paul when he
[1:27:15] eventually became converted it's
[1:27:17] constant regret was how he persecuted
[1:27:20] The Church Without measure how many read
[1:27:22] that in the Bible he will always refer
[1:27:24] to it now what if he has an additional
[1:27:27] sight of Steven saying Lord require my
[1:27:30] blood from this man how do you think
[1:27:32] Paul will feel all his life he will want
[1:27:35] that question
[1:27:36] settled but Steven released him release
[1:27:40] everybody in your Camp yes release
[1:27:43] everybody in your cage so that you
[1:27:45] yourself could Prosper so that you
[1:27:47] yourself could have your way because the
[1:27:50] prophet said if you keep ought against
[1:27:52] any man you are walking over the danger
[1:27:54] of Hell
[1:27:55] Fire so if the Lord has done this in
[1:27:58] your life amen you are in the purpose of
[1:28:02] God you love him
[1:28:07] tonight the prophet
[1:28:10] said anything that serves the purpose of
[1:28:15] God will have what a
[1:28:20] resurrection and I want to say this
[1:28:23] whether you to serve the purpose of God
[1:28:26] or a purpose for God you will have
[1:28:29] Resurrection that's
[1:28:32] right the question is in what
[1:28:35] Resurrection yes are you catching it now
[1:28:39] the scriptures spoke of a better
[1:28:41] Resurrection is the language of the
[1:28:43] Bible Hebrews chapter 11 he said all
[1:28:46] those Saints all those Heroes of Faith
[1:28:49] they refuse compromise
[1:28:52] Deliverance a delance that will come
[1:28:54] with compromise sacrifice of the word
[1:28:57] they are not ready to no they said we
[1:28:59] rather die than to deny the word friends
[1:29:02] you are going to the same Heaven they
[1:29:05] went so this is why we in our day cannot
[1:29:07] be wishy-washy and tell you what they
[1:29:10] never had as much as we are having right
[1:29:13] the revelation we have today they never
[1:29:15] had it Daniel peeped into it God said
[1:29:18] excuse me shut it up never preached it
[1:29:23] even John that brought the Book of
[1:29:24] Revelation gave it in symbols yes amen
[1:29:28] it was only in these last days that we
[1:29:30] received the revelation of the
[1:29:33] symbol so we are having a better deal
[1:29:35] than them
[1:29:36] all but in the much that they had see
[1:29:40] their
[1:29:41] life so that means automatically with
[1:29:44] the greater things we have our life will
[1:29:46] be the better right because we are to be
[1:29:49] the cstone the sealing of the others in
[1:29:52] all ages they are perfection
[1:29:55] without you they are not
[1:29:57] perfect
[1:29:59] amen so what a life we are called on
[1:30:01] to but all these Brethren refused
[1:30:05] compromise Deliverance the Bible said in
[1:30:08] order that they might obtain a better
[1:30:10] Resurrection so it's the language of the
[1:30:12] Bible not mine amen and why is the
[1:30:16] Resurrection the
[1:30:17] better because the first resurrection
[1:30:20] that better one has many other packages
[1:30:23] is it's just like you are going on
[1:30:25] vacation and they tell you that this is
[1:30:27] $1,000 package this is 3,05 package the
[1:30:33] organizers are not dumb if they make one
[1:30:36] $1,000 and they make one
[1:30:38] 3,05 before you jump at saying I got a
[1:30:41] bargain you better check the contents of
[1:30:43] your
[1:30:44] package because what is loaded in the
[1:30:47] 30005 package cannot be the same with
[1:30:51] what is in 1,000 package
[1:30:54] if you don't take care to check those
[1:30:55] things when you get there you will see a
[1:30:57] lot of access denied for you that's
[1:30:59] right and they say if you want those
[1:31:00] access open pay the balance that is the
[1:31:04] same way it is in the kingdom of
[1:31:07] God there are some access deny level
[1:31:10] Pastor because if you don't come up in a
[1:31:13] better Resurrection you have a lesser
[1:31:16] package those who come up in the first
[1:31:19] and the better will enjoy the
[1:31:22] Rapture h three and a half years wedding
[1:31:26] supper is in the package the Lord 1,000
[1:31:29] years of Millennium is in the
[1:31:32] package
[1:31:34] amenallah sitting on the white Throne
[1:31:36] judgment to judge the Earth it's in the
[1:31:39] package and when eternity sets in Pastor
[1:31:42] living in the first Square City it's in
[1:31:44] the
[1:31:46] package but do you know what those who
[1:31:48] come up in the second and general
[1:31:50] Resurrection will miss those packages
[1:31:54] this is why the Bible qualified one as
[1:31:56] the better resurrection and the other is
[1:31:59] as just
[1:32:01] Resurrection those who serve the purpose
[1:32:04] of
[1:32:06] God will have a better Resurrection
[1:32:09] amen even if you never serve any purpose
[1:32:13] you will come up in the second
[1:32:17] one and the second one is very Daisy
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:21] amen you can make it or may not make it
[1:32:26] amen so everybody will be
[1:32:29] resurrected the question is in what
[1:32:33] resurrection and let me say this tonight
[1:32:36] like I said we're just taking extracts
[1:32:38] from the entire
[1:32:40] length the purpose of God can never be
[1:32:44] defeated right
[1:32:50] amen and the prophet said and you all
[1:32:53] will agree with with me each of us that
[1:32:55] is on Earth today we are brought for a
[1:32:58] purpose that's right whether it's a
[1:33:00] purpose for him or a purpose of him both
[1:33:03] cannot be defeated because nobody no
[1:33:07] situation can resist the will of God yes
[1:33:10] if God made a man a pharaoh he cannot
[1:33:12] change himself he must do that Pharaoh
[1:33:14] activity if he made him a Judas es
[1:33:16] scariot he must serve that
[1:33:19] purpose that's what it means that's
[1:33:21] right nobody can resist his
[1:33:25] will so it's a privilege if you find
[1:33:28] yourself on the righteous side when you
[1:33:31] know these things nobody will beg you to
[1:33:33] Worship the Lord amen you will know that
[1:33:35] your whole life must be a worship to the
[1:33:37] Lord this was a revelation brother
[1:33:39] boswood had and he got excited every day
[1:33:43] he will say I look at myself among all
[1:33:45] the billions that are on Earth that God
[1:33:48] will single me out in my own little
[1:33:50] corner for salvation when he could have
[1:33:52] taken somebody else beside me what is
[1:33:55] the marriage
[1:33:56] election what is election the love of
[1:33:59] God his free will it's good pleasure
[1:34:01] whatever he
[1:34:03] wanted because you and I never lived any
[1:34:06] life in
[1:34:07] advance to Merit what we are having
[1:34:11] today you never impressed him amen the
[1:34:15] prophet said in the back part of his
[1:34:19] mind he drew his own conclusion and he
[1:34:23] said he has has never had or taken away
[1:34:25] from his thoughts his original thinking
[1:34:28] remains his final thinking till
[1:34:30] today so you and I were are brought here
[1:34:33] for a purpose right you love him
[1:34:36] tonight so let me say
[1:34:38] this it is wrong for a man to say I want
[1:34:43] to design a purpose for my
[1:34:47] life I'm sounding rude or
[1:34:50] hard I want to design a purpose for my
[1:34:54] life if you study the message you will
[1:34:56] never see a language like that you
[1:34:57] hardly let me not say you will never but
[1:34:59] I never seen a language like that but
[1:35:02] the language you would rather see the
[1:35:04] prophet saying is if you can find your
[1:35:08] purpose finding your purpose is
[1:35:11] different from you developing a
[1:35:14] purpose your job is a job of Discovery
[1:35:19] not a job of
[1:35:20] designing or conceiving you know why you
[1:35:24] didn't create yourself that's right amen
[1:35:29] see this microphone in my
[1:35:31] hand it was somebody who looked and
[1:35:36] said if we could make something that
[1:35:39] will ampify the voices of human being
[1:35:41] when they are speaking a larger audience
[1:35:44] of people could benefit from their
[1:35:46] speech is that right right because no
[1:35:49] matter how much a man shouts he might
[1:35:52] not be able to reach a wide audience
[1:35:54] but we make this to amplify his voice
[1:35:56] and we make this speakers to carry the
[1:35:58] Amplified voice are you not hearing me
[1:36:00] now and I'm not training my voice to
[1:36:03] speak you understand so that means
[1:36:06] somebody came up with a
[1:36:08] purpose you understand he now designed
[1:36:11] this product to meet that purpose this
[1:36:15] product was not the one that designed
[1:36:17] itself for the purpose it's having
[1:36:19] tonight are you catching it huh now you
[1:36:23] take it back to yourself This is why
[1:36:25] there is no useless person in God's
[1:36:28] economy my Bible said you are fearfully
[1:36:31] and wonderfully
[1:36:34] made you are like a portion in the body
[1:36:37] Temple of the Living God do you know in
[1:36:40] the temple of Solomon God taught us a
[1:36:42] vital lesson all the materials the
[1:36:44] stones that were used for that Temple
[1:36:46] were said to be brought from all over
[1:36:47] the world but as they are coming in into
[1:36:51] Jerusalem to be fitted into saw the
[1:36:54] temple building each was Finding their
[1:36:56] place isn't that Supernatural yeah they
[1:36:59] didn't have to be record or shapen or
[1:37:02] beating with armor each Stone cut as
[1:37:06] they came from all the countries that
[1:37:08] they came from was finding a place it
[1:37:10] was just came to here this one came to
[1:37:12] here this one came to here then they
[1:37:14] find one they call it an hot stone and
[1:37:17] they said this one does not really have
[1:37:19] a place they throw it away when they
[1:37:22] were about finishing the Cor cor Stone
[1:37:24] they find a gap
[1:37:26] missing and they use they walk on every
[1:37:28] stone they brought every stone to Feit
[1:37:30] nobody fitted until they went for the
[1:37:32] rejected Stone it logged into that
[1:37:37] place this is why you are fearfully and
[1:37:40] wonderfully made church let me tell you
[1:37:44] tonight there is nobody sitting here
[1:37:46] tonight that God brought you
[1:37:50] accidentally even if your parents T your
[1:37:53] conception was mistake you know human
[1:37:56] say we we W planning for that but it
[1:37:58] came it is you not planning God was
[1:38:03] planning did you hear
[1:38:05] me it was a mistake it's a language of
[1:38:08] human being in God's economy there is no
[1:38:11] coincidence neither is there any
[1:38:15] mistake that is why the prophet said
[1:38:17] when the Lord send them we will receive
[1:38:19] them are you following because nobody
[1:38:22] came here by
[1:38:24] chance you were brought here because you
[1:38:27] have a purpose to serve that is what I'm
[1:38:30] saying right amen God is not a showman
[1:38:34] who does things just to show he can do
[1:38:36] it and if God located you in bringing
[1:38:39] you to the Earth in this part of America
[1:38:42] is because you have your purpose to
[1:38:44] serve here it puts me in the economy
[1:38:46] where I am because I will work better
[1:38:49] there are you catching it I will be more
[1:38:52] I will serve I'll be useful for his
[1:38:54] purpose there than here amen and he put
[1:38:58] you here because you'll be useful for
[1:38:59] his purpose here than
[1:39:02] there and when he puts you in a local
[1:39:04] assembly you are also not an
[1:39:07] accident it's purpose keep trickling and
[1:39:10] keep unfolding every hour even to the
[1:39:13] minutest detail of your life to the
[1:39:16] family he brought you in that's right
[1:39:19] the prophet said there are reasons for
[1:39:21] these things
[1:39:23] they don't just happen by
[1:39:26] chance when this when you understand
[1:39:29] this you will not child God foolishly
[1:39:32] you will not say why me Lord why did you
[1:39:34] even put me into this
[1:39:36] family why why all those why we
[1:39:40] begun and you you need to remove the why
[1:39:43] so you can see the purpose
[1:39:46] right because there's a purpose for
[1:39:48] everything yes that's right there's a
[1:39:50] purpose for flowers there's a purpose
[1:39:53] for the tree there's a purpose for the
[1:39:55] moon there's a purpose for the sun those
[1:39:58] are lesser creature when it compared
[1:40:00] with you if God find purpose for nature
[1:40:03] how much more his children amen you
[1:40:06] forfeit your peace you burn energy too
[1:40:09] much and you get born out because you
[1:40:12] are laboring to design and not to
[1:40:17] discover God already designed you for a
[1:40:20] purpose the prophet said find it
[1:40:24] that's right that's all he said look for
[1:40:27] it and stay there he said because in his
[1:40:31] purpose he will bless
[1:40:34] you now look at this
[1:40:36] equipment as long as it's serving its
[1:40:40] purpose he will enjoy
[1:40:43] care from the owner isn't it yes they
[1:40:46] will come they will clean it they will
[1:40:48] check if the battery is okay if there's
[1:40:50] anything they'll polish it that is your
[1:40:56] life the reason you don't feel that
[1:40:59] loving HS of God his protective his
[1:41:02] maintenance his support is because you
[1:41:04] are still killed outside of his purpose
[1:41:08] when you come into his purpose God takes
[1:41:11] obligation for your
[1:41:13] maintenance
[1:41:15] amen he brought you here amen and as
[1:41:19] long as you are serving that purpose you
[1:41:22] shall be maintained yes does this mic
[1:41:25] have to cry for battery before we know
[1:41:27] we should they are batteries charging
[1:41:29] there
[1:41:31] already oh yes I saw them on Sunday
[1:41:33] charging some already charged waiting to
[1:41:35] be put in there so that his purpose can
[1:41:38] be blessed isn't it God is mindful of
[1:41:41] that that is you as human being you are
[1:41:43] mindful of if I want to enjoy the use of
[1:41:45] this car I must maintain it isn't it yes
[1:41:48] regular
[1:41:50] servicing you are the one checking it
[1:41:52] for the car
[1:41:53] not the car checking it for itself
[1:41:56] you'll be keeping your eye for the cars
[1:41:58] that self diagnose themselves they will
[1:42:00] tell you when they are du you if they
[1:42:02] are programmed at 5,000 miles on the
[1:42:05] nearing 5,000 mil they will tell you but
[1:42:07] you are conscious you are watching let
[1:42:08] me be sure I'm not I've not run out of
[1:42:11] miles you will pay to maintain the car
[1:42:15] and because the car is serving this
[1:42:17] purpose the payment looks like nothing
[1:42:20] you are happy to pay the dealers or the
[1:42:22] technicians to check this to check this
[1:42:25] you happy to go and wash the car we
[1:42:27] traveled yesterday and you know the
[1:42:29] screen become a bit blurry coming back
[1:42:32] with insect the Pastor said let us stop
[1:42:35] by and wash our car the car doesn't have
[1:42:37] to protest or tell us to get that the
[1:42:40] owner knows what to
[1:42:43] do that is why your owner said take no
[1:42:46] thought did you catch that yes for what
[1:42:49] to eat what to drink or where which
[1:42:50] shall you be clo he said your owner
[1:42:53] knows you need these things your own job
[1:42:56] is seek first his kingdom serve your own
[1:42:59] purpose then I will maintain you whether
[1:43:02] you ask for maintenance or not I know
[1:43:04] what to do that's what he
[1:43:08] said can our Revelation go higher and it
[1:43:12] doesn't matter where you are serving
[1:43:13] your purpose if it's in the village if
[1:43:15] it's in the city the god of the city is
[1:43:17] the god of the village it will take care
[1:43:19] of
[1:43:20] you it is those who lack the revelation
[1:43:23] of purpose that are jumping here and
[1:43:24] there and think that until I get here my
[1:43:27] life cannot be better your life is
[1:43:29] better by the purpose you
[1:43:34] serve are you with me
[1:43:36] S so it's important we wait upon the
[1:43:39] Lord Lord why did you bring me here
[1:43:42] brother Braham said that's what you
[1:43:43] should ask he said somebody is
[1:43:46] responsible for you being brother here
[1:43:48] he said have you asked him why you are
[1:43:50] here right he said when you ask him
[1:43:53] sincerely he will give every answer when
[1:43:55] you discover your purpose stay in there
[1:43:58] brother Braham said I find my purpose is
[1:44:00] to bring souls to the kingdom he said I
[1:44:02] am determined more than ever to uphold
[1:44:05] that purpose to serve
[1:44:08] it and as long as he does he's
[1:44:12] maintained
[1:44:14] Hallelujah you see how to make life easy
[1:44:17] oh what you don't need to forfeit your
[1:44:19] peace just understand the principles and
[1:44:22] I want you to know that what purifies
[1:44:25] you what PES you what makes you holy
[1:44:27] what retain your blessing is the purpose
[1:44:30] you serve my sister your nice dressing
[1:44:34] dressing as Christian sister is not what
[1:44:36] makes you holy right it is the purpose
[1:44:39] that appearance serves amen godess that
[1:44:42] purifies you because when God sees you
[1:44:45] in that appearance he knows you are
[1:44:46] doing something for the kingdom you are
[1:44:48] defining to the world how a
[1:44:50] Christian should be when you you dress
[1:44:53] right is a worship to God that's what
[1:44:55] the prophet said he said worship is not
[1:44:57] only
[1:44:58] singing he said anytime you do that
[1:45:00] which is right he say you are worshiping
[1:45:03] God if somebody is taking the name of
[1:45:05] the Lord in vain and you can rise up and
[1:45:08] say my brother my sister there's a
[1:45:09] better life than this don't do that he
[1:45:11] said you have worshiped the Lord amen so
[1:45:14] it is the purpose how the things we do
[1:45:17] it is the purpose they serve that
[1:45:19] purifies
[1:45:21] us are you catching it the reason we are
[1:45:24] cleaning that car is because it's
[1:45:26] serving the
[1:45:28] purpose if the car refuses to carry us
[1:45:31] again and it becomes a liability we're
[1:45:34] going to make it a
[1:45:36] junk that shows he has what rebelled
[1:45:39] against his own purpose we find no use
[1:45:41] for it he's going to gather dust
[1:45:43] somewhere or we are going to auction it
[1:45:45] as
[1:45:46] a are you catching it but as long as he
[1:45:49] serving it we will change the oil we'll
[1:45:51] renew it from inside
[1:45:53] as long as we will wash it because we
[1:45:56] know every death on the car speaks of
[1:46:00] the owner you didn't catch that if the
[1:46:04] car is dirty nobody abuses the car they
[1:46:07] abuse the owner he says see this ah see
[1:46:10] this dirty guy look at his
[1:46:13] car how can somebody's car be this dirty
[1:46:16] nobody is abusing the car they abusing
[1:46:19] the owner so God is conscious of his
[1:46:22] reputation being at stake by your life
[1:46:25] this is why he says he said you do the
[1:46:27] right thing you serve my purpose and I
[1:46:30] will take care of the rest are you with
[1:46:33] me isn't that a good deal isn't that a
[1:46:36] fair deal you do it every day that's
[1:46:38] right you do it to your car you do it to
[1:46:40] your cloth why do you take it to the
[1:46:43] lunders the dry
[1:46:44] cleaners because it's having a purpose
[1:46:47] you are the one that knows when the when
[1:46:49] the cloth is dirty it needs some washing
[1:46:51] some ironing some because you want to
[1:46:53] look nice God can only look nice by you
[1:46:57] right amen God will be able to W off uh
[1:47:01] every insult by your life so that is why
[1:47:05] when you are serving your purpose your
[1:47:07] purpose is what blesses you is what
[1:47:09] keeps you holy it what keeps you clean
[1:47:12] is what keeps you provided for it what
[1:47:14] keeps you maintained and let me add this
[1:47:15] to it is what keeps you alive
[1:47:18] right it is your purpose that preserves
[1:47:21] you
[1:47:23] that is why the prophet said nothing can
[1:47:25] take us until our purpose is
[1:47:29] complete the day this microphone refus
[1:47:31] to function again and we take it for
[1:47:34] repair and the technician tells us
[1:47:36] nothing can be done for it that is the
[1:47:38] day it dies in our
[1:47:40] church we're going to do what throw it
[1:47:43] away if you keep it as a relic of what
[1:47:45] we have used before it will be under one
[1:47:47] chair in the
[1:47:51] artics you know you know what the
[1:47:53] purpose drove him there you are alive
[1:47:56] tonight because you still have a purpose
[1:47:58] to
[1:48:00] serve praise the Lord the day your
[1:48:02] purpose is done brother Braham said for
[1:48:04] him he doesn't want to stay one more
[1:48:06] second are you with me
[1:48:09] church let us find our
[1:48:12] purpose let me close by
[1:48:15] this all the things that happen in our
[1:48:19] lives they are not happening because it
[1:48:22] is brother
[1:48:24] Steve they are happening because of the
[1:48:26] purpose you are brought to
[1:48:28] serve your purpose will attract
[1:48:31] challenges and it will also attract
[1:48:34] blessings but guess what what keeps you
[1:48:38] afloat is
[1:48:40] recognizing that you are a child of
[1:48:43] purpose
[1:48:46] am the challenges that came to Joseph I
[1:48:49] think we talked a bit about him last
[1:48:50] Sunday so it becomes easy to just refund
[1:48:52] past through was it because it was
[1:48:56] Joseph it was because of his
[1:49:00] purpose God revealed that Purpose By A
[1:49:02] Dream which became a vision well
[1:49:05] interpreted but the Brethren refused to
[1:49:09] understand and by that they set to
[1:49:12] battle against their brother so what
[1:49:15] exposes Joseph to all those challenges
[1:49:17] all the way was
[1:49:21] purpose but but despite the fierceness
[1:49:24] of the challenge was he
[1:49:25] defeated Joseph was not defeated because
[1:49:28] the purpose he is to serve cannot be
[1:49:31] defeated your purpose is beyond
[1:49:35] you because it is God that Fashions a
[1:49:38] purpose if that purpose is defeated God
[1:49:41] is defeated so you yourself become the
[1:49:44] beneficiary of your
[1:49:46] purpose amen so let it give you energy
[1:49:49] every day that I cannot be defeated
[1:49:52] because the purpose of God for my life
[1:49:54] cannot be what
[1:49:56] defeated it must come to pass in the
[1:50:00] dungeon it came to pass when the Arabian
[1:50:03] Merchants came to fetch him out of the
[1:50:05] dungeon it was coming to pass when they
[1:50:08] went to P's house it was coming to pass
[1:50:10] when he came to prison it was coming to
[1:50:12] pass adversely but that was the road he
[1:50:15] was inching close to that purpose isn't
[1:50:17] it God used
[1:50:20] adversary to bring him to his purpose
[1:50:22] amen it doesn't matter the road you get
[1:50:25] there
[1:50:26] through because you are a child of
[1:50:28] purpose the Lord will preserve
[1:50:30] you and eventually Joseph became the
[1:50:34] birthright holder the provider for the
[1:50:37] family to preserve life and prosperity
[1:50:41] for his own generation isn't that what
[1:50:43] happened and that was why he told the
[1:50:45] Brethren he said you meant it for evil
[1:50:48] but you guess what all this old drama
[1:50:50] was God's Own Way of sending me am in
[1:50:54] advance to preserve your lives so when
[1:50:57] Moses understood the purpose it became
[1:51:00] easy for him to release
[1:51:02] everybody go with his song and his smile
[1:51:05] be an Israelite indeed in whom there is
[1:51:07] no
[1:51:09] gu what do you think of
[1:51:13] Moses sometimes Satan himself I told you
[1:51:17] before maybe it was here or not I said
[1:51:20] that guy is not as smart as you think he
[1:51:21] is
[1:51:24] when Moses was born he knew there's a
[1:51:27] nemesis waiting for him he just couldn't
[1:51:31] pick then you know what he said he said
[1:51:33] go kill all the firstborn all the boy
[1:51:36] all the male children in the hope that
[1:51:39] he will Target Moses the one who was
[1:51:41] sent to be the deliverer are you
[1:51:44] catching it so what exposed Moses to
[1:51:46] that danger was not because it was Moses
[1:51:50] it was because of the purpose Moses was
[1:51:52] brought to serve but as long as you are
[1:51:56] a carrier of purpose your purpose will
[1:51:58] preserve you God told Mo God told the
[1:52:02] parents of Moses if you keep him you
[1:52:04] going to lose him right now I want you
[1:52:06] to do one more thing for me I want to
[1:52:08] carry the battle to the enemy's Camp
[1:52:10] drop that boy in the river now and watch
[1:52:13] my hand you have done your beit let me
[1:52:15] take it
[1:52:16] over oh friends River N is a is a river
[1:52:20] infested with crocodile why couldn't
[1:52:22] they where were they sleeping when Moses
[1:52:24] crib was passing through the river why
[1:52:27] didn't they come out to eat up Moses
[1:52:31] purpose preservation by what
[1:52:34] purpose Miriam a sister who was waiting
[1:52:37] through the water following the crib
[1:52:39] could have been
[1:52:40] stun by a sea snake or a water snake or
[1:52:44] a crocodile why did God keep them busy
[1:52:47] elsewhere because this one is a child of
[1:52:50] purpose and nothing could tamper with
[1:52:52] him until his purpose is accomplished oh
[1:52:56] wait for it my brother my
[1:52:58] sister God guided him straight to the
[1:53:01] enemy's camp and he was welcomed by the
[1:53:04] enemy's
[1:53:06] daughter and God introduced the boy to
[1:53:09] the enemy's daughter God did not hide
[1:53:11] the identity of Moses when that lady
[1:53:14] carried him he said this is an Hebrew
[1:53:17] boy so why didn't he kill him because
[1:53:21] that was the order
[1:53:23] why did it he suffocate him or strangled
[1:53:25] him because
[1:53:28] purpose are you catching it when he saw
[1:53:32] this one he said this particular one can
[1:53:34] die I'm going to take him as my
[1:53:37] baby what was working
[1:53:40] purpose Hallelujah the purpose of God
[1:53:44] for your life for my life cannot be
[1:53:46] defeated our purpose will preserve us he
[1:53:49] will protect us our purpose will fight
[1:53:51] for us
[1:53:52] our purpose will make our life endure it
[1:53:55] could expose us to dangers but guess
[1:53:58] what because God is the owner of our
[1:54:01] purpose God being not able to be
[1:54:03] defeated that purpose cannot be defeated
[1:54:06] and we become the beneficiary of that if
[1:54:09] our purpose cannot be defeated it means
[1:54:10] we also cannot be defeated we are here
