I'm walking with the king. One time, brother brother says he don't know where I get my songs from. He says uh uh he don't know. So um I was thinking on the song and then I remember when he said that I started laughing to myself. I said, I know when I start singing this one again, he says, "Where did this guy get these things from?" Praise the Lord. You know, it's an old old uh Sunday school song we used to sing uh that says uh uh uh oh, I I wrote a song and I sent it over back there to the to the uh tech people if I can just remember the song.

We will we will just go to the to the word this morning. Oh yeah. Okay. The song I was thinking about is that we are we are traveling. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we we are traveling &gt;&gt; to a land on our way to heaven. That song started playing in my head the whole week. I was just, oh my God, I'm going to sing this morning in church again. Praise the Lord. No, I'm not going to do no right or left for you. Oh, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's take let's take our Bibles. I knew I as I was singing I was thinking about that left for rightful thing, &gt;&gt; but uh I put some other words to it. Um, Genesis chapter 1. Let's take Genesis chapter one &gt;&gt; this morning. I was I was kind of studying on something and then uh uh I ran into to something and I want to share with you. So portion of my uh preaching this morning will be information but I hope that the Holy Ghost will will use it to to bring uh inspiration to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope the information will bring inspiration to you because it's the inspiration of the almighty that gives life. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is uh the word inspiration means the breath of God. &gt;&gt; So uh Genesis chapter 1, let's read verse 11. Genesis chapter 1 verse 11. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herbs yelling seeds, and the fruit trees yelling fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth, and it was so." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So let every seed bring forth of his kind. Let's pray together. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, this morning, we want to just humbly approach you, Lord, Father God, and ask for your help this morning, oh God, because uh none of us, Lord, have the right, Lord God, to handle this word except Lord Jesus, you come and help us, Lord. I pray that Lord, you would just open it to our hearts and speak to us this morning in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I might be all over the place, but just follow me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just follow me. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Praise the Lord. Now, guess what I was I was thinking about and what I've been studying on. Actually, I've been looking at what Rod Brown talks about uh uh in the in the message. Spoken word is the original seed, the the prophecy he said the Lord gave him when the Lord told him to pick up his pen and write. Now there's a there's a lot of things in there that been that have been coming to me and if I have time I will share some with you if not today but there is something that I wanted to speak about and that took me back there to to go and and and study that closely and uh so while I was looking at that uh uh pick up your pen I started looking in the scripture and just to see how many times God spoke about picking up pens to write. And uh uh uh uh Job said in Job chapter 19, Job chapter 19, let's uh let's read that. Job chapter 19 verse 29. Um Job said uh he said these words, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; No, I said 29. I'm wrong, guys. 24. Job uh 19:24. I'm I'm looking at what they put up there. I'm saying that's what I said, but that's what I said. 24. Let's look at verse 24. It's a very famous scripture, very famous scripture. When you look at verse 23, he says, "Oh, that my words were written, all that they were printed in a book." Praise the Lord. Now he's going through his trial and he's uh wanting a record on it. Now so there there are a lot of there are a lot of uh uh uh I don't know what I can say argument or information that whether the book of Job was written by Job himself or it was written by Moses because the book of Job is one of the oldest book in the Bible and Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible. Moses was not living in the time of Job. Job lived before Moses. Abraham laid before Moses. Noah laid before Moses. But we know that Moses by vision wrote the book of Genesis. And uh so uh uh uh so lot lot of scholars uh you know want to attribute the writing of the book of Job to Moses. We don't have any account on that. But uh but we see Job here desiring that his words will be written. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But he says something that is very very very very profound that uh I never saw until I started studying on this. He says, "Oh that my words were written or that they were printed in a book. All that all uh I mean that they were engraved with an iron pen and led and laid in the rock forever. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. All that they were engraved with an iron pen. Now uh that iron pen is uh is a word that is used by structure and that is the way that you write on a rock. So if a structure takes a machine and he's writing he's he's hitting it and trying to make a B c on a rock that thing he's holding that that chaser he's holding in his hand will be called an iron pan. True. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because that's the only way you can write on the rock. For a word to be engraving on the rock, it has to be written by an iron pen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is not an iron pen. It can write on rock. &gt;&gt; This is a paper pen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, so that that just studying that it it really hit me in the face. It hit me in the face quickly and I say, "Oh, there is something here. There is something that Job is saying that is very, very prophetic." Because God wrote on the rock. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The tablets were rocks. &gt;&gt; The tablets were the ten commandments were written on. They were they were they were tablets that were cut from the rock and God himself wrote on the rock. So God wrote on the rock with an iron pen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the way, merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. now. So, um it it it really you know it caught my attention and uh and then I started looking looking uh uh more than looking at pain. I'm I started looking at iron pain which of course that's not the first time that God said it uh uh or not. The first time the Bible will use that word the next time it will use that word will be in Jeremiah. Now, so God will use that word in Jeremiah talking to the the children of Israel, talking to the people of Judah because they have indulged themselves in idolatry. They had h many different forms of idols that they were worshiping. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm really intending to shock you this morning. That's really that's that's what I'm intending to do. So, let me warn you before we get there. Amen. So, just hold hold fast to your seat that if I shock you, you won't drop on the ground. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you fall, we'll pick you up. I promise. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like I said, we'll be all over the place. I'm not sure I might get to my to my subject I want to talk on this morning, but uh uh we get there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; You ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, because I say I will shock you. You You are not responding. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I don't know what you came for. &gt;&gt; Okay. I won't shock you. I will embrace you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we embrace you with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So if if we look in Jeremiah chapter 17, let's look in Jeremiah chapter 17. This there there's a whole lot here we have to deal with people. We have we having a whole lot here. We having uh a full a full meal here that we can I can I can easily preach for three four hours, but I will keep you for that long. Now, so if you look in Jeremiah chapter 17, uh, verse one, the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond. &gt;&gt; It is engraved upon the table of their heart. So God is also using an iron pen to write on on the heart of the people. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when Paul says we are a written episode read by all men and he make us to know there in his writing that uh the you know that that the episode is written upon our heart is also written with an iron pen. we will get to death, not to die. But he says here, the sin of Judah is written with a pen uh of iron and uh uh with the point of a diamond. It is engraved upon the table of their heart and upon the horns of their altar. Praise the Lord. which the children remember their altar and their growth by the green tree upon the high hills. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what what is happening here is that the people have indulged themselves into lot of idolatry. Let's go to Jeremiah chapter 7. Let's go to Jeremiah chapter 7. Praise the Lord. Jeremiah chapter 7 verse one. The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the the the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying stand in the gate of the Lord's house and proclaim there this word and say the word of the Lord all ye Judah that enter in at these gates or to worship the Lord. Thus say the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I meant your ways and your doing, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. Trust not, trust ye not in lying words, saying the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord. These these are these. For if ye uh thoroughly amend your ways and your doing, if you thoroughly execute judgment between the man and his neighbor, uh if if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, the widows, and you go on and on and on and on. Now, what is happening here? Uh uh uh uh let me go a little bit again. Then I will cause verse seven. Then I will cause you to dw in this place in the land that I gave to your fathers forever. And behold, ye trust in lying words that cannot profit. Will you will ye steal murder, commit adultery, swear falsely burn incense onto B, and walk after other gods whom you know not? Yet you are saying the temple of the Lord. We have the temple of the Lord. What was happening here is that the people were indulging into idolatry but yet they had they they were very comfortable to go to the house of the Lord and claim that uh they were they were believing people. They were people that were believing in God and because they think that okay we have a temple down there. I go to the temple I do my duties. I pay my my my my tithe and whatever it is. But yet when when they get out of the temple and go to their home, they are setting up different forms of idols. &gt;&gt; They are setting up different forms of idols. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the reason that that that kind of drew me in this, like like I was just telling you, now I'm studying all of this uh uh uh uh pick up your pen, the right thing, and then I get into this uh uh uh uh iron pen. And then I'm realizing that God is is dealing with Israel on their idolatry. So, I go back a little bit to be able to get uh uh uh a little history to what I'm reading. But then I realized that as God is dealing with these people uh you will see chapter 7, chapter 8, chapter 9 and chapter 10. Now chapter 10 caught my attention because in chapter 10, if you go to chapter 10, you will see uh oh Lord help me this morning. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You had you had breakfast this morning. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I never I never had none. So I can I can feed on your energy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so in chapter 10, in chapter 10, watch this now. In chapter 10, let's read from verse one. Yeah. Yeah. the words which the laws speak unto you, oh house of Israel, for thus said the Lord, learn not the ways of the hidden. &gt;&gt; What was the ways of the healing? Idolatry. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Learn not the ways of the hidden. And be not dismayed at the signs of heaven. For the heathen are dismayed are dim. For the custom of the people are vain. For one cut a tree out of the forest and and and work the work of the hand of the workman with axe. They deck it with silver and gold and fasting it. Now, if you if you read down here and you are you are a a Bible student, let me not just say Bible readm. If you're a Bible student, you will you'll realize that this chapter and this verse is the verse that have long been associated to Christmas tree. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It have long been associated to Christmas tree. That's the reason why Christian f at Christmas tree but was God talking about Christmas tree and I don't think he was talking about Christmas tree he was talking because it's not only Christmas tree that is that that is idolatry it's anything that we put first in our life anything we are putting before our prayer life anything we are putting before our devotion Our obedience to God's word is an idolatry. &gt;&gt; It's not only a Christmas tree. &gt;&gt; Now, here is the thing now that like I said I that was going to shock you &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon will read from this particular book of the Bible. He would read from this particular chapter of the Bible. He will preach a message &gt;&gt; and he will say not one thing about Christmas tree. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here's the most thing that will shock you. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. You realize there are there are some things that uh and and that is and that is the way I am. If I really don't study something, I don't preach about it. And I will promise you that I've never preached about Christmas tree over this movie. So you cannot tell me you know my position on Christmas tree &gt;&gt; because I've never preach it. &gt;&gt; I've never preach it. Praise the Lord. So whatever whatever position you have, I was not the one you got it from. &gt;&gt; Now this is what will shock you. Let's let's let's go ahead and study together. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you worried this morning? If you get your Christmas tree up or you think I'm coming to bring it down, praise the Lord. Glory be to God. Let's let's just enjoy the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just enjoy the Lord. There are there are better things to preach about than for me to come and spend all my time preaching on Christmas tree this morning. Okay, let's this is what I want to bring to you in the message, the sign of his coming. That was the message brother Brandon preached uh where he read from Jeremiah chapter 10. He read from Jeremiah chapter 10. He read verse one and verse two and he went on and preach his message. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the prophet of God. This is the man that God has given the mis h the responsibility to to tie all the loose ends. All the things that we believe are mysterious in the scripture. He was giving the the the ability the commission he fulfillment of revelation 107 to tie the loose ends. Praise the lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now there's a reason why I'm going down this road. So you just you just hold tight now. So he's saying this, listen now. About six weeks ago, one morning I guess I was on the road to Arizona with brother Softman and brother Wolves. Two of the trustees of the church at the tabernacle at Jeffersonville. He was on the road. They were traveling. He says, "And I saw a vision of a strange thing. There were two men and and and they were both kind of a well trim trim up men and they were both kind of fighters. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this message was preached on April 6. He's saying six weeks ago before April 6. Praise the Lord. I want you to put put all that you you mathematician you can do the calculation and just and just let us know when when we need it. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is two men that you know uh they were kind of a fighter. They they they had on regular clothes but they were kind of real fighters. They they they they wanted to fight and they had a grudge against each other and one of them now he's having a vision he don't know these people they are traveling on a trip and he breaks into a vision this was something that was very common for brother Brandon praise the Lord &gt;&gt; people around him will say that he will always he was he was somebody that have a good sense of human &gt;&gt; and he and and and he loved joking because it helps him to get away from vision. &gt;&gt; That was his way to get away from vision. &gt;&gt; He said something at the beginning of this message. I laughed so high yesterday. I said, "Oh my god, where did the man take this thing from?" But I I'll keep that for another day. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll keep that. I don't want to get out of place. So, so yeah, he's having a vision and and and and he going on here. They did got into it. The both men got into it. It looks like it was in New York. I could see myself coming there towards the arena. He's in a vision. He's seeing the two men h are going to fight or they are fighting and in a vision he's coming to the arena to see what is happening. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I was kind of studying the message that I entitled preaching by vision. So I'm hope I can I can I can share that with you sometime in the future. The uh uh I could see myself coming down there towards the arena and so for where I preach so much which mean he have had service in that arena in New York where this fight was taking place. And I looked it and looked like there was a little hole around a little hole round place like this of a place they had got into and they started fighting and one killed the other and I seen it looks like something dim or water and And they had looked like uh uh a a cellophane something that that was put over one fist. So it looks like in a vision they were fighting one of the men killed his friend and now he's seeing them coming to cover the body. That's what he's describing now in a vision. Everything got real quiet and it was sad. They did kill one, I killed the other one in the field. And I thought, well, I don't know exactly what that means, Lord. I just kind of jot it down. He's driving in a car. He's in this vision and he's seeing it. He cannot identify the people in the vision, but he just wrote it down. I don't know what it means, but he just wrote it down in and the brothers, they in the crowd, you know, maybe they're talking something. They don't know he's having a vision, but he's having a vision. He wrote it down. &gt;&gt; Love the Lord. You You all know what taking place the other day. Two uh witherw fighters in New York fighting out and one kill. kill the other one, you see. And he is really good. He's talking about God now. So, Brother Brandham is saying that uh you heard it on the news because as you as we read down here, he did not know that this happened and and this thing happened two days before he's preaching this message. Okay. He says he's and he he is really good isn't he letting us know these things because their reason I didn't I I didn't uh uh it didn't look like pertaining to the church. So, I just let it go. And uh uh a while ago, I never learned of it till just a while ago, I was thinking, "Yes, yes, sir." And I got that wrote down in my little boat. You see, I didn't know what it was. It seems like I stepped down uh that hole like that uh went in in the place. um was was the ring they were in and they were fighting in fuel and one killed the other. So another field both in the same uh then he start talking you know when when whenas will start taking one another live then is not worth it. Amen. And he says uh that's the same like king Cain and and Abel say king and Abel fell you see uh uh there to see brothers brother kill brother now so but we are so glad that we are trying to restore brothers back. Amen. Not to kill brothers but we restore brothers back to the faith once the faith that is once delivered to the saints. Now here is the thing. Here is the thing now. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That it will please the Lord. I put up my pictures. Put up my pictures. I love these things because as I was as I was studying, I decided to go back since uh uh uh uh intelligence. Put up the first two pictures. That was the fight. That was the fight. This is uh uh uh where is the young man name? One of them is called uh Benny the Kate. This is Benny the Kate. He was the one that got killed in the fight. And the next picture. Okay. And this is uh uh Emry Griffin. So it was Benny and uh and and Emmy that fight. Uh so when brother Brandham shared this apostle t I went on Google I said 1964 two boxers fight in New York and one got killed and they brought me the information. So I he says, "Okay, I'll look for some pictures so I can I can bring I'm a news reporter." Okay, I'm a news reporter. So I'm trying to carry you back 1964 so you can uh have a picture of what happened. Praise the Lord. He never gave us the main name, but if there were two boxers that fought and one killed, that was international news. That was n international news. So definitely there should be some information about it. So I decided I will for for the benefit of the doubt I'll bring you more information. So uh so you will know that our news report is is verified. Amen. We don't need to bring you a picture when the prophet said it but uh I think it will help you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It will help you so you can be able to grab what I'm talking about. Uh uh so said that that uh brother Brandham is having a vision. He says he said this. He said it never concerned the church. That that was the same word. He had a vision concerning uh uh uh what's the lady name? Uh Miriam Merald. What's her name? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He had a vision concerning her. And he says uh they say she died of suicide. He said no that's lie. She died of heart attack because I saw her in a vision. Until now it's recorded that she died of sweat. I wish they will believe the prophet report. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I believe I wish they will believe. That's brother Brandham telling us a vision six weeks that he saw before these two men will get in the fight and one will kill the other. It does not have anything to do with salvation. It does not have anything to do with repentance. This uh this man uh the one that that that killed a friend might have never heard about brother Brandham. He might have never even heard that brother Brandham had a vision. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But now see the contrast. Here is brother Brandon PREACHING FROM JEREMIAH chapter 10 THAT HAVE BEEN PREACHED OVER AND OVER and we have established a doctrine that says that the Bible says it's wrong to have Christmas tree straight. And I'm not even saying it's right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to to to to to come to a balance this morning. But there is something I'm trying to bring here. How that is the way that we can make a doctrine an idol because we have make it an idol. Now here is Jeremiah talking about the people cutting down trees and fashioning it. Do you know that this wool is a tree that has been fashioned &gt;&gt; and we can design it and put flowers on it? And how do we call it? Sacred. &gt;&gt; We call it sacra. This is the sacred. &gt;&gt; Is it is it a deck THAT IS SACRED OR THE WORD THAT IS PREACHED FROM THE DECKS? Are you seeing where I'm going? &gt;&gt; How we form idol? &gt;&gt; WE WILL WE WILL DISREGARD the word of God, but yet we say it's A SACRED DESK. NOBODY IS QUALIFIED TO GO BEHIND the sacred desk until he meet the pillar of fire where &gt;&gt; are you understanding what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This piano, this this thing here is a wood. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I wish I could play. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Man praying for the day where the anointing would drop. &gt;&gt; Now this is made out of a wood is being deck designed fist very well and we can also make an idol out of it. We can also YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT JEREMIAH WAS DEALING WITH THE idolatry that was havoc in the hearts of the people. BUT HE'S SAYING THAT GOD IS EVEN WRITING WITH AN iron pen describing the idolatry that the people has har in their heart. So is Christmas tree the only idolatry? Let me I will tell you what what we have done with that. I'll tell you what we have done with that. What actually we have done is that we have used that to to abuse our mind and and and that is some of the reason why the church is very poor in giving. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I will explain myself. &gt;&gt; I will explain myself. You just sit tight because Christmas we know there is nothing truth to the myth of Christmas. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet a prophet would tell us THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE DATE IS, I just read some things to you here this morning. He says he says a divine healing. He says and the fact of all the error and everything there is about it talking about Christmas there is there is something about it that the word tried to make it an Xmas you know and but God still got a Christmas in it somewhere hasn't he sure has he has got something about it. Just the very name and the thought of the birth of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; JUST THE VERY NAME FOR THE FATHER IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BIRTH OF JESUS. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT COMES TO YOUR MIND? FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORD THAT HE GAVE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. AND IF YOU DON'T GET THE REVELATION OF CHRISTMAS, YOU WILL NEVER GET THE GOOD sense of giving. &gt;&gt; That's what Christmas is all about. God gave so we can learn to give. &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE ABUSED CHRISTMAS in a religious way, &gt;&gt; we don't have no true sense of giving. &gt;&gt; We don't have no true sense of giving. I will tell you which of course is a fact. You can you can prove it anyway. You will realize that around around the church you will find out that uh uh uh because of the principle of tithing. You'll find out that uh in the church finance there is more tithe than there is offering. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's a teaching for another day &gt;&gt; because t is not just about money. No, it's a covenant. &gt;&gt; It's not just about money. But it's BECAUSE OF THIS WHOLE concept of giving. And one of the THING THAT HAVE DESTROYED THAT CONCEPT is our lying teaching about Christmas. WE HAVE PILED ON ALL THE CONTRARY QUOTES ABOUT Christmas and found nothing good about it. IF WE SAY GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, Christmas is about the day that the son was giving. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And as much as we don't believe in Christmas, we still look for a Christmas card. We still hope that somebody can send us a card. I never got nothing for this Christmas. We say honor our breath because we don't want anybody to believe that we believe in Christmas. And we have also make that an idolatry. Thinking that we are doing God a service, we have make that an idolatry. And because we have make it an idolatry, what God expect from us? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The shepherds were told about his birth. They came down to to to the the the the the the manger where he was and they ran down there that I mean they were just on the field that night. They never had gifts in their hand but they sang songs to him. PRAISE THE LORD. THE WISE MEN WERE TOLD ABOUT HIS BIRTH. A SON ANNOUNCED HIS BIRTH IN HEAVEN. THEY FOLLOWED THAT SON. THEY GATHER GIFTS. THEY BROUGHT GIFTS TO HIM. That's what Christmas is about. God giving you gift and you also giving the Lord gift and giving the ones around you gift. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But because of the myth of doctrine and teachings that we have we have formulated for ourself, we have abused ourself of death. Because we don't want to be found guilty of celebrating Christmas and yet we celebrate it. It's an adole in our heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I mean, are you so shocked? Are you so quiet? &gt;&gt; You were not expecting it. You thought I was going to nail Christmas tree. &gt;&gt; It's not only a Christmas tree that is made out of wood. This poopy is made out of wood. &gt;&gt; The piano is made out of wood. When we only limit worship to the sound of a piano and we cannot lift our voice and sing and praise God, we are making the piano an idol. That if the piano don't sound, we will not praise God. So you're making this wood that they put some belts in. You're making it an idol. Oh yeah. The guitar also is made out of wood. I think so. &gt;&gt; I don't think they're plastic. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. With some strings on it. And we must only hear the sound of a guitar before we can we can sing. Then you're making it an idol. AND THAT WAS AND THAT WAS THE thing that JUDAH WAS CAPTURING. THAT WAS THE THING THAT THEY WERE TRAPPED IN. THAT WAS THE THING THAT GOD WAS REBUKING IN THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH. THE IDOL TRAIN THAT HAD CAUGHT THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE. BUT YET THESE WERE PEOPLE THAT WAS SHOUTING THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD. THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD. I'M IDENTIFIED WITH THE TEMPLE. I GOES TO THE TABERNACLE. I'M IN THE MESSAGE. But yet their hearts were full of idol. They idolize things. They idolize men. They idolize substance. And it stop them from bringing true worship to God. It stopped them from bringing true worship to God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I told you another time I says when you when you look at the you look at the the scripture for God so loved the word that he gave. That's the meaning of agapo. Agapo gave filot takes. With filio love we just won. We won. We won. We want but I got gifts. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; GOD FIRST EXPRESSION THAT HE GAVE himself when he was COMING FROM THE INTERNAL SPIRIT TO EVEN BEGIN TIME. HE GOT A CONDESCEND. HE CONDEMNED HIMSELF CALLED THE LONGEST AND HE GAVE HIMSELF. He's always giving. He's always giving. There's a there's a there's a old song that says you can never beat God in giving. &gt;&gt; No matter how hard you try, the more you give, the more he give back to you. &gt;&gt; You can never beat him in giving because that's his nature. He gives. And you see that it's is becoming a poor culture among us that that we are not we are not even thinking about it that we're not even teaching our children to give. I remember being small when we go in the church, you know, uh uh uh the parents will make sure that the first thing before you, hey, come here, come here. They will tell you that your offering when you go pay your offering and then pay my own offering. They can't go to church, but they will give you offering so you can pay for them. Pay my offering. Oh, how what about God I used to be. I'll eat that offering. I split it in two. Praise. Praise the Lord. I hate love, God money. God have mercy on me. Praise praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and sometimes too is is really because I wanted to buy some uh some donuts or so. That's why I would really get ready for church because I know they're going to give me offering. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, but that poor culture, that poor culture, because that's how you have to understand God associating with you. He gave himself. He gave himself. It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not for what what the the commercial word is making Christmas all about. No, that's not what it is. But you see, we have jump on the wrong train and it has affected us. It has affected us. It has affected us. Praise the Lord. that he has robbed us of death. Praise the Lord. That's such a time of the of of the year where the word try to practice a little sense of giving. It's not in us. Why? Because we make it I don't believe Christmas. Yeah. We we say I don't believe Christmas. I don't I don't we don't believe Christmas. We don't celebrate Christmas, you know. Uh so we we just we just take it from our mind. But is that the word? Is that the message of the hour? Amen. Is that the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, sorry if that I'm not preaching what you expect this morning, but I not even got to my message yet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, brother Brown. Right here in uh in uh uh God wrapped gift, he says. And then I want to take the time to the time to express to each and every one of you how grateful I am to you for your Christmas cards and gifts and things that you receive. uh uh and things that was received at our house. I certainly thank you with all my heart. I certain I it certainly did us good this morning. I got a little bored small enough yet to kind of want a Christmas tree and uh we had it in the room and this morning go on there. I found several gifts from my church year and from my friends around different places that had come laying under the tree and I don't have words to express to you how I appreciate everyone of them. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now you see there there there are places where we can we can we can become you know we can we can take uh uh uh you know uh a trade and and and ride on certain things you know to be able to to promote uh uh you know our our belief and our conviction in in everything. But uh what I'm trying to bring to you this morning uh I'm not I'm not uh you know I don't I don't have a factory. I'm not working with no company. So I'm not selling Christmas tree. &gt;&gt; So don't think that I'm I'm trying to promote you to come and buy Christmas tree. I don't I'm not selling it. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to bring us a balance to our mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm just trying to bring a balance and uh and the most that I'm trying to do this morning is to see is to help us see how we have abused our mind and we have put ourself into a very poor culture. We have put oursel into a very poor culture that the real true sense of giving is not among us. We do a more of obligation than of cheerfulness. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's written, it's written there in the message and brother Brandon will say over and over. Giving is part of our worship. &gt;&gt; He said it's part of our service. &gt;&gt; It's part of our service. But are we teaching our children that? &gt;&gt; Are we teaching them that? Oh, it's so easy for you to say, "Well, now we in a cashless society." I mean, I So, so what what what you're doing is that uh uh uh they are not taught that. So when they ever get to the place of where now they can own their own money, they don't have it in them because it's not part of their education. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What you telling them is that uh I'm working so I'm the only person that can pay offering. You're not working yet. So find your own money. &gt;&gt; When you start working then you you start paying offering. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you Are you seeing Are you seeing where I'm going with this? Praise the Lord. Our eyes have seen his time and we have come to worship him. That was the confession of the wise men. We have seen his time. We have seen the revelation that this is the star of Judah. We have seen the fulfillment of Bam prophecy. A star will rise out of Judah. We have seen his star and we have come to worship him. And brother Brandham says their gift shows the revelation of what they thought of him. &gt;&gt; The star when they saw the star, the star uh it was just a star, a constellation of star. But the revelation that they received from that star fashion their heart that they were not capping after one another. No, this one says, "I believe THAT HE'S A KING. HE GOT HIM GOLD." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; THE OTHER ONE GOT HIM FRANK INCENSE. Because of his service, worship. The other one got him a gift that speaks of his death. THEIR REVELATION FROM THE STAR PREPARED THEIR HEARTS &gt;&gt; to give to what God has given to them. And it was Christmas. It was Christmas because the star appeared at his birth. So it was Christmas. It was their attitude to Christmas to bring gift. We get on this train where we just use it just to insult. Praise the Lord. But yet we go to Walmart and buy our little idol and put it on our arm. Nobody must see this my Christmas gift. I nobody buy me anything for Christmas. I buy my own said Christmas gift and then we come right in our house and lock the door and and open. Oh, at least I got something for myself for Christmas. Christmas. THAT'S WHAT JEREMIAH WAS REBUKING THE PEOPLE FOR. The idols they had in their home, THE IDOLS IN THEIR COVERS, THE IDOLS THEY WERE KEEPING AND YET CLAIMING to be people of the tabernacle &gt;&gt; when it's something a period of time where uh uh uh we must show some sense of cheerfulness, some sense of gratitude. Yeah, NO MATTER IT'S NOT A PRICE TAG. NO MATTER WHAT IS WHAT IS WRAPPED AND BROTHER B WILL EVEN PREACH TO US GOD'S WRAPPED GIFT &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WRAP HIMSELF IN FLESH AND GIVE to us. &gt;&gt; If God will give us gift on Christmas, what is wrong for you to give somebody something? What is wrong for you to wrap a a an old shoes and give it to somebody? We build our own idols and we think that we are bringing God pleasure. We think we are making God happy because we are not like the heathens. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have Christmas tree but yet we have LED lights that are shooting different colors. Praise the Lord. No, we're not calling Christmas light. They are not Christmas light because we don't believe in Christmas. So they are LED light. God told the children of Israel, "Have no other God before me." Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have no other God before me. YOU MEAN GOD GOD WAS SO STRONG ON IDOLATRY UNTIL HE NEVER WANTED the people to even have a picture. A picture. Amen. When the Bible says don't have no similitudes, anything that looks like, praise the Lord. I want YOU TO HAVE THE REALITY. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOK LIKE THE PILLAR OF FIRE. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOK LIKE THE PILLOW OF CLOUD. I WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE THE PILLOW OF CLOUD. I WANT YOU TO GO IN HIS PRESENCE. COME OUT OF HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I want you to be limited to a picture. I want you to be to for you to experience God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's more interested in us experiencing his presence, &gt;&gt; breathing his presence in and out, &gt;&gt; walking into it, &gt;&gt; then doing everything that we have to do when we come into church. Then we just come so quietly because we entering the temple, the the house of God. The Bible say there must be silence. So we walking we're trying to be to us do we having reference now when there is no reference in our head &gt;&gt; when there is no reference in our attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What are we talking about? I was I was just I was studying all of these things and I was just I I was just I was just I was just saying, Lord, I I I don't know what this thought is taking me to. I really don't know. But it was it was just before I left from here last night. It thought kind of a break to my heart. I said, "Okay, now I see what autobase is all about because I I don't I don't have time spending my my my you know my time on uh kind of uh you know uh uh preaching something because I want to be popular. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I for a long time I have believed that whether you have Christmas tree you don't it don't make no difference. You it don't make no difference. We all celebrate Christmas. It's just that we are hypocritical about it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very same thing, you know, it's around the message cycle to take your phone and text somebody and say Merry Christmas, we got to take one quote of brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; We are not free to say Merry Christmas. But if we say brother Brandham quote this is not actually Christmas but I just want to say merry Christmas it's being hypocritical. It's not wrong to send brother Brandham quote but if you cannot say merry Christmas because you feel that it's an idle word but I can only say it because the prophet said it then is being hypocritical. It's being devilish. We are making an idol out of God's seven. And that's that's exactly what uh uh h Jeremiah is dealing here with. God had to use an iron pen to write on the hearts of the people. Why? Because idolatry has taken their heart. IDOLATRY HAS CONSUMED THEM. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPROACH GOD without an idol before it. They either make a man an idol, THEY MAKE A CHURCH AN IDOL, THEY MAKE A DOCTRINE AN IDOL. THEY CANNOT GO BEHIND THE VEIL themsel and LET THE CURTAIN DROP BEHIND THEM AND GET IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SHAKANA GLORY AND FEEL THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; They got to use somebody as an idol. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. See what see what the dictionary said here as I was looking at this yesterday in the scripture. An iron pen symbolize permanence. WHEN JOB SAID A ALL MY WORDS could be written that it could BE WRITTEN WITH IRON PEN AND ENGRAVED in a rock. IT MEANS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS WRITTEN IT STICKS THERE. It cannot move. It means permanent. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you better know what you're writing on your heart with an iron pen. Because if you put an idol on your heart with an iron pen, it will not move. It was still there all the days of your life. &gt;&gt; You worship an idol. &gt;&gt; You can never get to God until you get to God through somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the scripture, an iron pen symbolize permanence, deep inscription, unchanging authority, unchanging authority, something that cannot be changed. When you write it there, it cannot be changed. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why when Moses came down from the mountain with the commandment and saw the idolatrate of the people, he smash it on the ground. God had to rewrite because it was an unchanging writing. You cannot put it together. You can't mash it up again. He had to go back and God had to rewrite the commandment and give it to him a second time. And it was because of idols. It was because of idolatry. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, you you studied the message. When brother Brandon talks about Christmas, he blasted against the idol of Christmas and how they have commercialized it. Praise the Lord. AND HOW PEOPLE ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME TO BECOME ONE BETTER THAN THE OTHER. THAT'S NOT THE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS. IT MUST NOT make us better than the other. It must MAKE US TO GIVE OURSELF TO OTHERS. &gt;&gt; Because someone gave himself to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW MUCH WE RECEIVE AND HOW MUCH GIFTS WE HAVE. IT'S HOW MUCH HAVE WE GIVEN. &gt;&gt; That's what Christmas is. Christmas is about giving people. It's about giving. Let's teach our heart to give. Give to the ones around us. Even give to strangers. We have abused ourself of of uh of uh of giving until even to help a poor stranger on the street, we got to stop being religious. Well, I don't want to give him money so he can't go smoke. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The taxes that they taking from your money, they can tell you what to do with it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The taxes that the government taking from your money, do they tell you what to do with it? &gt;&gt; I mean, we it just it just put us to the place where we just become so poor in heart. learn about learn about brother Brandham. It would tell you that that brother Brandon was somebody that that that love tips. He gave general tips. The brother spoke about one time they were in a place and and this and this server was very you know she was very rude. She was so harsh and all of that. And at the end brother Brad give her a tip. The the brother asked brother Brandon he says why are you giving her such a tip? She her service was not good. &gt;&gt; But Brandon said maybe she had a bad day. &gt;&gt; Maybe she's dealing with something. &gt;&gt; That was the kind of a man that will Brandon was. &gt;&gt; Hope was dying. Charon Maru was dying. His boat was on the Ohio River rescuing people. He was giving his service. That's what Christmas is about. That's what Christ is about. That's what Christianity is all about. Giving ourself for others. Giving our service. What am I preaching this morning? Pick up your pen and write out going to my message here. But I just got stuck in this thought because I was telling on this iron pan and come down to reading about uh Judah and her idolatry. Get right in Jeremiah chapter 10. When I'm reading I said so this is the verse that we have used over the years to to create Christmas tree when it's not even talking about Christmas tree. Uh if Christmas tree Christmas tree is not the only idol that is de that is deck with God. Praise the Lord. Just one time uh you know a brother was driving with me and uh I had a I had a cross in my car and he asked me he said brother why you have that Catholic cross in your car. I said why make it Catholic? He said, "Because it say have Jesus on the on the cross." So I I told him, I says, "Sir, I I laugh in my head a little bit." I says, "Well, if you show somebody your baby picture, does that mean you stay baby?" &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you were working at uh uh Cup Food and you took a picture just to show that you were working at Cup Food and you show it to someone, does that mean that you are still working at Cup Food? Says, "Well, no, it does not means but you you know I mean if you have Jesus on the cross, it means that you he still on the cross." Oh man, we just limit ourselves just to a concept and now we think we are so revelated. We are so religious when there is more of God to know. &gt;&gt; There is more of God to know. THERE IS MORE OF GOD TO KNOW. CAN YOU IMAGINE GOD TELLING YOU KNOW COME AND walk with me in I want to take a walk with you and they agree and you know stop by and says are you I always wanted to come to this place I I always wanted to and he just stayed there he will never he will have never been raptured if you get stuck in an idea that's where you will stay because there is more of God to know there is MORE OF GOD TO LEARN. &gt;&gt; Never take a very and you just wrap yourself in it. Nobody can I mean let your let your knowledge of the word benefit others. Let your knowledge of the word makes people comfortable to come around you. If you GET A STATIC KNOWLEDGE that looks like it's a it's a it's it's a septitan doctrine that looks stink and it's so scary because you believe that people can't come around you there is something wrong with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your knowledge of Christ must create a sweet atmosphere around you &gt;&gt; that will make people comfortable to come around YOU EVEN IF THEY DISAGREED. I DISAGREE WITH that guy, but I still love him. And just something about him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm I'm so stuck in this place, I can't even go anywhere. &gt;&gt; Uh deity of Jesus Christ. And today that me that memorial of his birthday, what do we do? They get some tree, cut it down, make a Christmas tree for the kids, but they think that's all right. I'm not kicking against that. Why we miss that? &gt;&gt; What do we miss when he say I'm not kicking against it? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE FOCUS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT THE MAJOR THING HE'S TRYING TO GET. WHILE WE LEAVE THE WHOLE HEAVEN AND ALL THE BLESSING THAT GOD GAVE US AND SPEND UH TWO HOURS TALKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS TREE, CHRISTMAS LIGHT and Christmas, Christmas. What is that? Why we miss that? I'm not kicking against it. That's what he said. But the thing of it, they put more on the Christmas tree than they put on Christ. That is the focus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE HE'S GOING WITH THE SUBJECT. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I promise you I will not study Christmas tree. I'm I'm being honest with you. I was not preparing to talk on this because to me that is some of the least thing I want to waste my time on. &gt;&gt; That's one of the least thing I want to waste my time on. I want to get closer to God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage people to identify their find their identity as a son of God or the daughter of God. No matter what we are going through because I I will tell you that uh life life is a mystery. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are more spirit bane than we are humans. We are put in this body &gt;&gt; to discover ourselves. &gt;&gt; God put you in this body for you to discover yourself. And all the days of your life that you live here, there are yet things you will not know about yourself &gt;&gt; until certain situation comes your way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There are things that are healing in your genetics that it takes certain situation to bring it out. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God will just look for the right kind of a person, &gt;&gt; the right kind of a situation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you if you bring everybody around you, he cannot get it out of you. You put some kind of a stubborn person on the phone. Yeah. One word they will say would just trick you up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You start yelling over your head. That's our journey on this earth. That's our journey. In as much as he want us to know about ourself, not only about our human nature, BUT AS A CHILD OF GOD, THE DEPOSIT that he has put in you, the abilities he have GIVEN TO YOU, THE POTENTIAL THAT HE THAT IS LAYING BEHIND YOUR FLESH. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET of God say is laying dominant in you. It's there. You have it. &gt;&gt; You are just all limited by your mind. The thing you think about yourself, you limit yourself with your mind. Your mind scares you and you cannot go a little further. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your mind scares you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what happened to all of these people, you know, that are on drugs or some kind of a substance. Their mind scares them that you cannot do without this. You really need this. No, try to go without it. You'll realize &gt;&gt; you won't die. You won't die. If you just push yourself a little bit, you realize one whole day has gone and you don't have it. Praise the Lord. Amen. One whole day has gone, you don't have it. It's almost like you get to work and you and you forget that you you you left your phone home. You feel miserable, &gt;&gt; but you will not die. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You're not going to die. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you can just get away from your mind, you will live a normal life and I promise you, you will be more productive. &gt;&gt; And when you have that little distraction, &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. YOU REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A HEALTHY DAY. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I bet you your mind going to trick you again. Don't leave it home tomorrow. &gt;&gt; So what you going to do? You take it, you put it, you put it to the front door. &gt;&gt; I don't want to pass by this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the mind. That's the human mind. The Bible says the days of Noah, their imagination &gt;&gt; was evil continuously. &gt;&gt; When the devil came down in the garden of Eden, what he did? He abused Eve in her mind. You see, when you do this, you will be like God. He reduced her &gt;&gt; to give her a desire to be something that she's already. &gt;&gt; She's a daughter of God. She came right from the hand of God. She was God's daughter. She was a god. But what he did, he reduced her in the mind. You have to do this to be better. &gt;&gt; You have to dress like this to be better. &gt;&gt; And that's how the devil rob us. The things that we must be enjoying. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. the things we must be enjoying, the things that are just they are they are just given to us for US TO USE AND GET RID OF THEM. But he abused our mind. He sent us into judgment. He condemn us so quickly and then we have to go the whole day being condemned in our mind because someone said Merry Christmas to me. I said merry Christmas. I'm not supposed to say merry Christmas because I don't believe Christmas. So he's just playing with your mind. Just then you go the whole day as if somebody has died from you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Say merry Christmas could kill you. You will die already. &gt;&gt; Are you saying what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But what what I'm focusing on this morning is just to show how the whole concept of that it really blew my mind. Why God will give brother Brandham a vision of two two boxers. What will become of them? Nobody know. Yeah. say he having a vision of two men fighting six weeks before it happened. The very day he's preaching, READING FROM JEREMIAH CHAPTER 10, HE WOULD RATHER TELL US IF IF IF IF if Christmas tree was abominable. WHY, BROTHER BRAND, WHY GOD WOULD NOT GIVE HIM A VISION ABOUT CHRISTMAS tree when HE'S PREACHING FROM JEREMIAH CHAPTER 10, BUT then gave him a vision OF TWO MEN FIGHTING and one kill the other one. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is nowhere in the message where you see brother Brandon interpret Jeremiah 10 that he means Christmas tree. You won't find it. If you find it, please bring it. I need it. It will help me in my walk with Christ. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now again, grab the concept of where I'm going this morning. Amen. Grab the concept of where I'm going this morning. I'm not sending every one of us to Walmart right after the service going for Christmas tree. That's not what I'm doing. That is not what I'm doing. It's just that it caught my attention. &gt;&gt; When I was looking into the subject or what I wanted to talk about, it just amazed me. It amazed me, you know, and and and again, it just brought more light to what the life of blood ranom was. He's driving with this man and he breaks into a vision. Six weeks dreaming about it. I mean, having a vision of these two men fighting and one kill. He look at it, he think about it. He did not see any spiritual application. So, he just wrote it down in his notebook. Never said nothing about it until it came in a paper. that two two men were fighting and when he realized yeah it was in New York. It was the very same arena that I saw them fighting. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. At least people will say is that well you know if brother Brandon never preach from a certain part of the Bible I can never preach from it. Well that that is for them. But Jerus said now, okay, he preached from this one. Jeremiah 10, he preached from it. He ran from it, but he never said one word about Christmas or about Christmas tree. Here he talks about the idol that the church had got themselves in. What brother was dwelling on on THAT MESSAGE IS HOW THE people are dismayed at the supernatural. HE SAID BECAUSE THE CHURCH HAS GOT INTO IDOLATRY THAT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE MOVE of God. They don't know the supernatural because Jeremiah says they are dismayed at the sign. He says even a Pentecostal church will not allow me to come and minister for them because they are dismayed at the supernatural. Say what what have where have we got to? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Maybe let's look for another time. This it's almost after 1:00 here and take you to where I wanted to go this morning with uh picking up your pen, right? Uh I'll take you to where I wanted to go this morning because uh what what I'm beginning to see as I said in the subject. Brother Bam said that his spoken word is the original seed. I want you to listen close to this. Here is where the spirit said pick up your pen. He said I want you to listen close to this. Praise the Lord. It's the same way when he preached the thanksgiving message invisible union and he read from Romans chapter 7. He says this this scripture is normally used about marriage. He said but it's more about prophecy. He said PAUL WAS PROPHESYING about the church. Praise the Lord. HE SAID IT'S MORE ABOUT prophecy than how we normally use it about marriage. It's more about prophecy. SO HERE HE'S BRINGING A PROPHECY TO US. He said pay attention here. The spirit said pick up your pen. Now you look in the book of revelation. I'm closing here. I don't if I if I go any further I will keep you here uh you look in the book of revelation. You see how the Bible says uh uh uh uh uh and unto the church of Epheso, right? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND ONTO THE CHURCH of Simna, right? Now, so you you studed the book of Revelation, you realize that Jesus, that's the only book that Jesus is the author of. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT YET HE'S HAVING JOHN AS A SCRIBE TO write as he dictates his message to the church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; SO IN ANOTHER SENSE HERE is that we're going to see that what took PLACE IN THE BOOK OF Revelation that because THE MESSAGE TO THE CHURCHES IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION WAS A PROPHECY. AMEN. Paul never knew that he was a messenger to to the Ephesus church. Praise the Lord. ALL OF THOSE MESSENGERS, THEY NEVER KNEW THAT THEY WERE MESSENGERS to the church ages. BUT HERE IS GOD SENT A PROPHET HERE WITH WITH WITH this ministry. AND HE SAYS THAT HE GOT THE KEYSTONE, the keystone to the WORD OF GOD. AND WITH THAT KEYSTONE REVELATION, HE WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE ALL THE MESSENGERS OF the church ages. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I love the way brother brother Andre said it the other time. He says uh uh UH YOU ARE NOT YOU ARE NOT ONE Paul to be you. We we would wouldn't have chosen Paul because we some OF US WILL STRUGGLE WITH THE FACT that he participated in the death of Stephen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the the most person he talk about also he says Luther how how come that Luther became the messenger of his age? Amen. How did he became the messenger of a church age? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke Luther was still smoking a pipe. Being a German, he was still drinking. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; With everything that we know about the message of the hour, if it were left with us, we would never choose Luther. Many of us will struggle with choosing Luther. This is the man that called the Jews an antichrist. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But think about it. He was in the age of justification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was in the age of justification. &gt;&gt; A man of a sanctified life could never be a messenger of the age of justification. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AMEN. &gt;&gt; A MAN OF A LIFE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST COULD NEVER BE THE BE THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE OF JUSTIFICATION. YOU NEEDED A MAN THAT WAS JUSTIFIED BY FAITH. WHEN A PERSON IS JUSTIFIED BY FAITH, THEY BELIEVE THE LORD JESUS YET THEY STRUGGLE with habits in their life. &gt;&gt; THEY STILL STRUGGLE WITH HABITS. THEY STILL STRUGGLE WITH DRINKING AND SMOKING. BUT THEY ARE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Do you see THE MIND OF GOD? &gt;&gt; HOW GOD CHOOSE A MAN &gt;&gt; THAT COULD WRITE A PUT ON THE CHURCH. THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE ONLY THING HE HAD TOLD. THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS AGE. &gt;&gt; HE GOD NEEDED THE RIGHT MAN. &gt;&gt; I love when brother Andre said he says he says the people said to Lu YOU GOT TO STOP DRINK. HE SAID IF YOU TELL ME TO STOP DRINKING I'll drink more. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Man, you can't you can't beat the mind of God. &gt;&gt; You can't beat the mind. That's what brother says. All that we know about God is just a grain of sand. Try to pick up a grain of sand. Shift all and just get a little grain in your hands. You can't even see it. &gt;&gt; That's all your wisdom about God. That all your knowledge about God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then when you come to our age, PEOPLE PEOPLE, HOW HOW CAN HOW CAN WILLIAM BRANDON BE THE MESSENGER of this age? He don't have no theological school. He don't have no uh uh because God in God's design, the messenger of this age never needed to to to to live on man's wisdom. It was an age where he saw high. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So right from his birth, God gave him visions. He were born with visions. &gt;&gt; Right from his birth, &gt;&gt; he told his mother, "We're going to live in Albany." When he didn't even know where they call a MOTHER WAS SURPRISED. WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT FROM, BILL? &gt;&gt; WHERE DID YOU HEARD ABOUT ALBANY? GOD DESIGNED HIS man &gt;&gt; for the responsibility. &gt;&gt; He never needed to go to school. He never needed a theological school. God fashioned him that way. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PAUL WAS GOING TO BE THE WRITER OF THE NEW TESTAMENT. So God put him under one of the best teacher, Galia. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THE BOOKS TO HIS FINGERS. GOD PUT HIM UNDER ONE OF THE BEST teacher in Israel at that time because he was going to be the writer of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when God looked down at this age, &gt;&gt; there was no one good to be here but you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. THERE WAS NO ONE GOOD AND BETTER TO BE IN THIS AGE THAN YOU. &gt;&gt; SOLOMON WAS NOT GOING TO SURVIVE. &gt;&gt; Women were decent in Solomon days. &gt;&gt; And he lost could not control him. &gt;&gt; HER WISDOM HAD NEVER SURVIVED IN LAUDITION. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when he looks in his economy, &gt;&gt; he says, "I know the right people for our nation." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GATHER THESE ONES. THEY MIGHT NOT THINK THAT THEY ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE, &gt;&gt; BUT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT CAN STAND THIS EDGE. &gt;&gt; No matter WHAT GOD THE DEVIL will throw on them, they can stand it. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why he gave you the kind of an upbringing that you have. take you through struggle, take you through suffering, take you from the worst part of the world. Guess what IT TAKES TO BUILD YOU FOR THIS AGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Judah Judas was following money. What would he have done? he would have been part of the the scandal that is in Minneapolis here because he love money. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have survived. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But when God looks in his economy, &gt;&gt; he took people from humble beginning. &gt;&gt; He took people from from a a miserable past. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, "That's my people for this age. I'm going to keep this." &gt;&gt; I keep the best for the worst. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to keep the best for the worst. &gt;&gt; Come what man, we are here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I show you in a scripture the last time those men that were following David, THE BIBLE CALLED THE MIGHTY MEN. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE say they were in distress. &gt;&gt; They were broke. They were in &gt;&gt; depths. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you in depth this morning? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm in debt. &gt;&gt; When God looked down, he said, "You are a mighty man." &gt;&gt; That's part of your debt. You still love the Lord. DESPITE OF YOUR DEATH, NOTHING STOP YOU FROM PRAISING GOD. AMEN. When he looks down, he's looking at your heart. He's not looking at your surroundings. He looking at what he puts in you, not what you have achieved. And what you think about yourself, the deposit THAT HE HAS DROPPED DOWN IN YOU. &gt;&gt; And there is no devil. &gt;&gt; No devil. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; The way God look at might is different from you and myself. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAYS, "MY STRENGTH &gt;&gt; IS MADE perfect in your weakness. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN REALIZE YOUR WEAKNESS. MY STRENGTH is made perfect in your weakness." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. Let's Let's get to that subject. You see where where we are GOING WITH IT. EVERYTHING THAT JOHN WAS TAUGHT TO WROTE, WRITE UNTO THE CHURCH. WRITE OF PHILADELPHIA. WRITE UNTO THE CHURCH. JOHN WRITE. John right. Even all of those things. A certain time the Bible says don't write. He said don't write, Joe. &gt;&gt; Don't write. &gt;&gt; Because that one &gt;&gt; a prophet will pick up his pen and write. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID WRITE, WRITE, WRITE RIGHT. BUT DON'T WRITE. &gt;&gt; Shut the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. YOUR TIME OF WRITING IS OVER. SHUT THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I feel like preaching now. &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother. &gt;&gt; I feel like preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have wor you out. Now I feel like preaching. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know if your tired mind, entire body can take it, but I really feel like preaching now. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
