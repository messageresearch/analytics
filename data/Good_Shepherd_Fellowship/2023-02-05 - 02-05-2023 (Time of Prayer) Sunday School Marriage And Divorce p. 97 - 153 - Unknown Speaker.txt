TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] nature you know but when she broke God's word God made a man to be a ruler over her Genesis 3 16 if you want to put it down she was no more equal with the man she was a breaker of God's word don't you see she she the church down here the breaker of God's word that sold her completely out of continuity and that's what the church has done his wrote spiritual death upon the whole thing now you'll understand why hammered these things like I do truth this is Bible facts notice why does she do such a thing as this how could that lovely beautiful perfect woman I've seen a picture one time I believe it was in Greece of an artist that painted a picture of Eve she's the most horrible thing ever seen that shows a lot of carnal mind can look at but she wasn't she was beautiful of course she's perfect woman or woman notice why did she do such a thing being in that high order she was right with man co-equal with him but we all know now that she will lost her co-equalus with man when she sinned and God said man will be your ruler from here out now that's the scripture if you want to we can read it I'm giving you the scripture so save time for this big hook up across the country that you might read it yourself notice the reason she did that how did Satan ever get to her did you know Satan must co-equal with God one day sure was all but a creator he was everything stood at the right hand of God in the heavens the great leading chairman notice the reason that she did this she was not in the original creation she is not in God's original creation she is a byproduct therefore the beginning as Jesus referred to it she was not a original created being of God she's a byproduct of a man when Jesus referred to the beginning remember Adam was both masculine and feminist in the original creation one but then he was separated by a rib notice but a byproduct and notice the only one of all God's creation of every animal and anything else she was the only one designed this way every other female was in the original creation every other female was in the original creation but Eve was not in the original creation see that had to be made that way we'll get to it after a while notice in this creation she was in not in the original but a byproduct and in this creation there is now I don't want to hurt your feelings but I want to tell you the truth and you just said still you're doing nice there is nothing designed to be so deceitful as a woman is this evil there cannot be nothing else there's nothing made to be that way that's right also there is nothing that can be so easily deceived as a woman now the fall proves this statement to be true the fall in the beginning she was not in the original beginning creation she was in Adam but not in a female set herself at the beginning she was a byproduct me now there's nothing designed that can deceive and be deceived as easy as a woman there is nothing designed or can stupid as low as a woman can think now there's nothing designed in all creation that can stoop as low as a woman can she can tear a man's heart to Pieces easier than anything else there is in the world is his wife that that nice little wife get to run around some other man look at that Feller sitting there with these children of Tears dropping off his eyes she is designed that way she is designed to do this there is no hog no dog or no other animal designed like her Ark is stupid as low as she can stoop okay now that is true yeah amen with regards to my sisters I just want you to watch no animal can be immoral you call the dog a slept the female dog you call the male hog aside but her Morris is a million miles Beyond many Hollywood stars that's how low she's designed to stoop she can't just think of this now there's nothing in the world made in God's creation that can be immoral stoop that low you say wait a minute man we're going to get to that the woman has to say yes notice there's nothing designed to stoop Solo or be filthy but a woman a dog can't do it a hog can't do it a bird can't do it no animal is immoral nor it can be for it is not designed so it can be a female hog can't be immoral a female dog can't be immoral a female bird can't be immoral a woman is the only thing can do it I see where Satan went see but still she has she's ones got the power to say yes or no see depends on where she wants to hold herself now here we can see plainly the serpent seed work come in there's only one place he could go to that would nail it down somebody's blind it had to go to that notice the reason animals couldn't do it a female animal they were in the original creation but the woman was not in that original creation now we're going back to dig this up and bring it right down to the modern day and The Testament she is designed alone for Filth and unclean living a dog can no other female can it's just the woman that can a dog or any other animals once a year and that for her babies not for sexual pleasure but for her babies the old saw the old dog once a year one moment that's for her babies but a woman is designed for any time she desires I've got some stuff crossed out here now you can imagine the rest a dog can woman can I hope that the Holy Spirit reveals you the rest of this I crossed out here she is the only species BC uh female that is made prettier than the male there's not another specie among anything all other creatures of God is beautiful males such as in animals birds and so forth always the male is pretty look at the big buck deer big fine horns grape species and a little humble Doe look at the big rooster with all these pretty feathers and the little brown hen look at the birds the and the hen why why was it such of all the creatures of God every creature in the mail is the prettiest between the Sheep between the Hogs between the horses between anything else it's always the big male is pretty and in the birds but in the human race it's the woman that's pretty not the man if he is he's something wrong it's crossed up seed somewhere a richness that way wow why was it done to deceive her designer Satan is still working on her tooth in these last days let me stop here just for a moment pretty did you know at the first destruction internationally of the world or worldwide was because of pretty women when the sons of God saw the daughters of man were Fair they taken unto them women is that right have you noticed the increase of beauty of women in this day I have seen the picture of Pearl Bryant which is supposed to be the prettiest woman in the nation at one time there isn't a teenage girl in this school but what would outshadow her when it comes to Beauty the increase of the beauty of women is showing the time of deception when did the church look any more prettier than us today the thing is featuring great big fine buildings and millions of this and millions of that don't you see the deception now there's nothing can stoop like her and she is designed so that she can be deceiving and Satan is really working on her today in these last days because he is her designer I can prove that now to go right back at the beginning who started to work on her foreign God or Satan see that's her designer it's her Chief weapon to throw man to her filth being a pretty woman she could sway on me any way she wants to brother date to Bootleg jaunt down here gets a man it's a pretty woman walking down the street twisting herself half dressed that's what takes that's a deceiver right there and she's deadly with it absolutely deadly you may question me about Satan being her designer but that's the truth Satan designed her he still does it let me show you something in the scripture I got to take it back scripture and you draw your opinion as you look at it today Satan is the one who features that kind of beauty if we'll notice he was the most beautiful of all these angels in heaven is that right yes and he desired to make Heaven a more beautiful place than the kingdom of Michael is that right also to show this Cain was his son he offered a more beautiful worship decorate his orders with fruits and flowers and so forth is that right beautiful sin is beautiful what we call Beauty today and sin is deceiving by Beauty and never look at a woman going down the street and tell what's in her heart thing but I won't just say these things to what you can see why that Satan is her designer it's exactly right his own son proved it King now she's beautiful so she can deceive the world is beautiful so it can deceive I mean Cosmos the order of the world it's beautiful so it can deceive great find places and luxury remember the prophet Amos when he come up over look down into the City and see like a modern Hollywood is the little eyes got little under that gray hair hanging in his face and he walked down there with a message and burst out on that place he said the very God that you came to serve will destroy you right sin is pretty they picture Judas as some old drunken sought out here on the street somewhere and mouth hanging with flies in it and so forth and Judas Judas is handsome strong a Deceiver they that gotta watch around you it ain't a guy that the old farmer come here with a pair of overalls on to watch around your wife is that slicker he's a rascal sin is beautiful to the eyes of the world but God is not featured in that kind of beauty do you know that God is featured in character beautiful character in the Bible Isaiah 53 if you want to put the scripture on it's got rules of scripture wrote on the side here for it Isaiah 53 the Bible said of our Lord Jesus that there was no beauty that we should desire him and we hid as it was our faces from him is that right we just desire him because he wasn't pretty is probably a little fellow stoop shouldered Ruddy looking and it wasn't desirable to be a leader he didn't look like a leader talk with Common Street talk and so forth like the people does the common people so therefore he didn't look like he's any great scholar educated fine all robed up and everything he was just an ordinary man there was no beauty of him that we should desire him he walked in and out of man right along that didn't even know who he was he didn't look like a god walking along what we'd think was a god but the same he was did you notice when the Lord God said to you just Samuel go up to the house of Jesse and anoint one of his sons King to take Saul's place now the people chose Saul when Samuel absolutely told him not to do it he said God don't want you to have a king he's your king and said if I ever said anything to you in the name of the Lord but what come to pass I've ever begged you for money or something other from a living they said no you never begged us for money and whatever you said in the name Lord had come to pass but we want the king anyhow so they chose Saul look what the World shows look what Israel truth amen Israel God's anointed they chose a man that was Head and Shoulders above any man in the nation great big fine handsome looking fella and he always was a fly in the ointment he but God said I'm going to choose you a king to my choosing so he said Samuel I ain't going to tell you who he is but you go up there's one of Jesse's Sons Jesse his wife and all of them look around said yes our oldest son he's a great tall handsome man he looked just right for the king's crown he's smart he's educated he's a fine man I know he'll be just right he speaks his word properly when they brought him out Samuel Took The Crucible and went towards him he said no the Lord refused him so he went all the way down to six Sons and the Lord refused every one of them he said isn't there another one oh he said yes there's one he's back out there herding the Sheep he just sits back there and plays songs and sings it and shouts and goes on but he's the little old stoop shoulder Ruddy looking guy he would never make a king he said go get him and while David come in the sight of the Prophet The Prophet remember the heart and poured it up on his head said this is God's children not pretty but character God looks at character man looks at natural beauty it's deceiving that's why a woman was given that beauty for deception to deceive a beautiful woman if she don't use it in the right way it's a curse to her that'll Center the hell quicker than anything else I know of if she just if she can be pretty sure as long as she stays with her husband and does what's right and that that's fine and dandy but she can take that same thing in my how she can deceive with it for it was give to her to do so notice now but God is featured in character there was no Beauty we should desire Jesus but there never was a character like him on the Earth Hallelujah oh we find out today that uh that Church character Satan and his group look after big beautiful churches beautiful things that's what the world looks at today oh it's a pastor the great so-and-so time so and so so Priestly and godly walking out these big robes and things like that they called that beauty but the real saints of God looks for the character of the Vindicated word that's what the Saints did in that day when they seen Jesus he wants nothing to look at but they seen God was in him they seen God was with him that's how that those uh joab and those characters are with David a little old fellow but they seen the the man was in him they seen that God was in him and they knowed he was coming into Power someday they once through them other five brothers of God single-handed one killed 300 men once some women was picking some beans for dinner the Army gone away and he took a spirit killed 300 man for listings character why they stayed right by David they know the anointing was upon him they know he was coming into Power a pure picture of the church today that'll stand by the word we oh it's going to be made vindicating we know it's coming into Power someday although Saul he was a fugitive from the rest of Nations they know he was coming into power we know he's coming into power too so we take that word and stand right there no matter what it costs we have to cut Palestines or jump in a pit and kill a lion as one did we go anyhow because it's so that's why God designed it to be we look for character you may now ask me why did he permit her to be designed thus I don't want to take too much time cause God a lot more to say here why the question might arise then why did God make this woman like this why did he permit her to be like that it was for his own good pleasure sure now if you want to turn in your Bible just a minute let's turn to Romans 9 just a minute and show you something how God does these things if you want to to read it and we can see here what God does for his own good pleasure a Romans 9 14. then what shall we say then is there unrighteousness before God when he chose Esau or chose Jacob and rejected Esau before either boy could have a right to make a choice himself neither one of them before there was born still in the womb of the mother God said I hate Esau and I love Jacob see why for he said unto Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not him that willeth nor him that runeth but it's God that's yourth Mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power Indy and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore he now what's your for he a mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardneth thou will say unto me uh why then does he find fault for who has resisted his will nay but o man who art thou that rise against God shall the Thane form say to him that formed it why has Thou made me this has not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and the other to dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endure such long sufferings The Vessel of Wrath fitted to destructions that he might make known the richest of his glory on the vessel of Mercy which he has a four prepared unto Glory now are you that'll happen God did it he had to make it this way it had to be there now listen now for about five minutes I want to call your attention to something what is God God is a great eternal at the beginning way back before there was a beginning he wasn't even God did you know that God's an object of worship and it wasn't nothing to worship him he lived alone and in him was attributes what is an attribute a thought now you get something else border on the lesson for tonight notice he was his attributes that was in him now it was in him to be father it was in him to be God it was in him to be son it was in him to be savior it was in him to be healer and all these things here are just displaying his attributes there's nothing out of order you think God didn't see the end from the beginning certainly he did there's nothing out of order just displaying his attributes now [Music] foreign [Music]
