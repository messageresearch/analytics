[3:33] the Jew could be justified because he
[3:36] did what Jehovah bid him to do finally
[3:39] that was right Jehovah did that and that
[3:42] was what he required but finally that
[3:44] became a family
[3:48] tradition it come atonement day and
[3:51] maybe the Jews have been doing what was
[3:54] wrong he'd say well I believe it's
[3:55] atonement day I better take my lamb down
[3:58] see it become a family
[4:01] tradition they didn't go with it with
[4:04] sincerity they just did it because the
[4:06] families had done it that's just the the
[4:09] thing we should do all the families do
[4:11] it so we should do it too and that's
[4:14] just exactly where our Christianity's
[4:16] got that's just exactly where our
[4:19] Pentecostal movements are coming to it's
[4:22] a family
[4:23] tradition see we don't we don't identify
[4:27] ourselves with our sacrifice that we are
[4:30] dead with our
[4:33] sacrifice we are we say oh we're
[4:35] Christians because I went and joined the
[4:38] church joining the church is fine but
[4:41] until you are identified till you lay
[4:44] your hands upon him and you and he
[4:46] become
[4:47] one until the spirit of Christ becomes
[4:50] in you in you in Christ until you become
[4:54] a son and daughter of God there don't
[4:57] seem to be the sincerity that they they
[5:00] are to have it's becomes a a ritual just
[5:03] the same as it is now it's a ritual for
[5:05] people to become a Christian here's some
[5:07] time ago I asked the young lady in the
[5:10] prayer line are you a Christian she said
[5:12] well I'm an American I'll give you to
[5:14] understand now like that had anything to
[5:17] do with it an American it's great to be
[5:19] an American but that don't mean you're a
[5:21] Christian you've got to be born again
[5:24] another woman I asked how are you a
[5:27] Christian why she was so put out she
[5:29] said I'll give you understand I burn a
[5:30] candle every night like that had
[5:32] anything to do with it you've got to be
[5:35] identified with Christ and his life
[5:38] living in you that's when you're
[5:40] identified with Christ as when Christ
[5:43] lives in you it isn't a ritual it isn't
[5:45] belonging to church that's all good but
[5:47] you see the real
[5:50] sincerity when we come to the healing
[5:52] Services if you'll notice on the
[5:54] discernment in the line it's constantly
[5:57] tell people to repent see there you go
[6:00] to our prayers has become a tradition we
[6:03] kneel down at night and say Lord bless
[6:06] so and so and bless so and so and do
[6:08] this and help John do all this you make
[6:10] God a mascot or you make him a some kind
[6:14] of Aaron boy God you do this and you do
[6:17] this and you do this that's not the way
[6:19] Jesus told us to pray he said to pray
[6:22] like this Our Father who art in heaven
[6:24] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[6:27] thy will be done and Earth as it is in
[6:30] heaven but we try to order God what to
[6:32] do for us and that's the reason the
[6:35] church is cooling off that's why the
[6:37] great Revival has just struck the land
[6:39] has put Millions into the church it's if
[6:43] they have got to a place that they're
[6:44] using these experiences and so forth as
[6:47] a tradition instead of being Godly
[6:50] sorrowful and letting the Holy Spirit do
[6:52] the work of his office within you and
[6:55] creating in You a New Life and making
[6:58] you so hungry to go to church that you
[7:01] can't stay away from
[7:02] church man that's what it is not to sign
[7:06] tickets and jar and have so forth It's
[7:09] to be have the Life of Christ in you
[7:11] that he just longs to go there's
[7:14] something within you a pushing you as I
[7:17] Sayang to a young man yesterday in a
[7:19] talk a little interview I said I used to
[7:22] pass by a little spring when I was a
[7:24] game warden in Indiana and there was is
[7:27] always the happi spring I ever seen in
[7:29] my life life great Springs in Indiana
[7:31] they Bubble Up of that fine cold water
[7:34] of limestone water and one day I sat
[7:37] down with the spring to talk to it just
[7:39] like I guess Moses would have set to the
[7:41] burning bush to speak with it and I said
[7:44] little spring what makes you so happy
[7:46] that you're bubbling all the time if I
[7:49] come here in the winter time you're
[7:50] bubbling if I come spring autumn summer
[7:52] whenever it is you're bubbling is it
[7:55] because that maybe perhaps you're so
[7:57] happy that the rabbit's coming drink out
[7:59] of you well now if he could talk he'd
[8:01] said no that's that's not it I'd say
[8:04] well maybe because deers come by and
[8:06] drink out of you he'd say no that's not
[8:08] it I'd say no well maybe it's because I
[8:11] come by once in a while and drink from
[8:12] you no that's not it I'm glad that they
[8:15] all come and drink but that's not the
[8:16] reason that I'm bubbling all the time
[8:19] well what makes you bubble like that
[8:20] what makes you so happy always gushing
[8:22] up if he could talk he'd say it's not me
[8:25] it's something behind me pushing me
[8:28] that's the way it is with a Christian
[8:29] experience it isn't something that
[8:31] you're trying to work up it's something
[8:33] behind working in you it's eternal life
[8:36] that's moving up gushing up like a as he
[8:39] told a woman at the well it'll be Wells
[8:42] of water springing up into eternal life
[8:45] it's something within the worshipper
[8:47] when he's been identified with Christ
[8:50] because he knows that he is alive but we
[8:53] don't want it to become a tradition when
[8:56] Israel got to a place that they made the
[8:58] Commandments of God god with their
[9:00] sacrifices or tradition it was then that
[9:04] the mighty prophet Isaiah was sent by
[9:07] God to them with thus sayith the
[9:12] Lord somewhere somehow God always can
[9:16] put his hand on a man that's not afraid
[9:19] to strip down the thing that's somewhere
[9:22] someplace Isaiah rose up if you read
[9:25] Isaiah 1 I got written here Isaiah told
[9:28] him said your sacrifices that Jehovah
[9:31] required has become a stink in my
[9:34] nose I despise them in the fats of rams
[9:38] and and of heers and so forth God
[9:41] despised them the very thing that he
[9:44] commanded them to do because they made
[9:46] it a ritual then God despised it because
[9:49] they made it a ritual and we can make
[9:51] the word of God the same thing amen
[9:54] right when we come to it as a tradition
[9:57] as a ritual we must come to it knowing
[10:00] it's so thus sayth the Lord if God
[10:04] promised it God will stand by his
[10:05] promise he's bigger than he's promised
[10:08] he's always been he's able as Abraham
[10:11] said to perform that which he had
[10:13] promised to do he's always able to do
[10:16] that to keep his word
[10:19] now Isaiah told him said all these
[10:22] things that they had been doing they had
[10:24] done it without sincerity they had done
[10:26] it just because the rest of them was
[10:28] doing it there because doing it also
[10:31] because it was a requirement of Jehovah
[10:33] and all the family did it and the
[10:35] mothers did it and the grandfathers did
[10:37] it why couldn't they do it now we do the
[10:39] same thing my grandfather was a
[10:41] presbyterian so I'm a presbyterian my
[10:44] daddy was a Baptist so I'm a Baptist and
[10:46] so forth and my daddy was a Pentecostal
[10:48] so I'm a Pentecostal that isn't it we
[10:51] come to the spot of where we realize
[10:54] that we have separated we are separated
[10:56] from God and we come upon the base
[10:59] of the shed blood of Jesus Christ under
[11:02] that blood there's where the Methodist
[11:05] Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian
[11:07] Pentecostals can all Meet on Common
[11:09] Grounds regardless of tradition they or
[11:12] ritual they can meet there under one
[11:15] common thing and that's upon the blood
[11:17] of Jesus Christ until the church gets
[11:20] back to a place and away from its
[11:22] rituals and back to God's original plan
[11:25] that men are born into the kingdom of
[11:27] God and not joined into the church
[11:29] p a time that Fellowship will rain
[11:32] everywhere and the spirit of the Lord
[11:35] will cover the Earth like the waters
[11:37] covers the sea when it comes to a place
[11:40] that man can forget their differences
[11:43] and come together in Fellowship under
[11:46] the blood we cannot all come under the
[11:48] Baptist tradition under the Presbyterian
[11:51] tradition under the Methodist tradition
[11:53] under the Pentecostal tradition but we
[11:55] all can meet and fellowship under the
[11:58] blood of Jesus Christ Christ because
[11:59] it's God's original plan that's right
[12:02] amen there's the pardoning a Methodist
[12:05] can look at a Baptist and hold his head
[12:07] sideways and the Baptist look at the
[12:08] Pentecostal the Pentecostal back of the
[12:10] Baptist on their Traditions but when
[12:12] they meet under to the Cross where the
[12:14] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses all man
[12:16] from sin he's a new creature in Christ
[12:19] Jesus he's a brother no matter what
[12:22] brand he's branded with he's a brother
[12:25] because that's one ground that we can
[12:26] all meet on it's God's way of doing it
[12:29] these other thing are man-made Creeds
[12:31] injected into this but God's original
[12:34] plan for pardoning is under the blood of
[12:37] Jesus Christ that's God's plan of doing
[12:40] it yes TR traditions in them days the
[12:44] great prophet cried out and he said your
[12:47] Traditions are powerless they stink
[12:50] before me have no faith in them the
[12:53] people was offering these offerings
[12:55] without even having faith in what
[12:57] they're doing now let's just ask oursel
[13:00] the question isn't that something like
[13:02] today as bad as we hate to say it we've
[13:04] got to face back somewhere there's
[13:07] something wrong
[13:09] somewhere while this church ought to be
[13:11] a million miles up the road to where it
[13:13] is now Jesus is waiting on his church to
[13:16] get
[13:17] ready his bride has made herself ready
[13:21] we got the potentials the holy spirit is
[13:24] here God is here the power to heal the
[13:28] sick the power to do all the things that
[13:30] Christ did I've seen it demonstrated
[13:33] Myself by the holy spirit so the
[13:35] potentials are here what God's waiting
[13:37] for us to get away from is our
[13:39] traditions and come back under the blood
[13:41] of his son Jesus Christ and become the
[13:44] Church of the Living God Methodist
[13:46] Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian whatever
[13:48] more whosoever will may come and take of
[13:51] the Waters of Life freely I believe that
[13:54] with all that's in me we God has sent
[13:57] down the Holy Spirit to do that but we
[14:00] with our rituals without sincerity we
[14:04] going is because of TR a tradition and
[14:06] because it's a ritual we go without
[14:09] sincerity Without Really sorrowfulness
[14:11] of sin I noticed the other night in that
[14:13] great famous meeting of one of our great
[14:16] renowned Brothers in California and on
[14:18] notice that meeting as those people come
[14:21] down young teenage children I admire the
[14:25] brother for his great stand anybody
[14:27] would if you position see what place
[14:30] he's taken in the last days you will too
[14:33] and as I notice those people coming down
[14:35] to the altar to make a decision girls
[14:38] chewing chewing G boys punching one
[14:40] another people laughing that isn't the
[14:43] way to come Godly
[14:45] sorrowful you must come under
[14:49] conviction God send us an oldfashioned
[14:53] penticostal Holy Ghost Revival that'll
[14:56] bring sin to the roof and bring
[14:59] conviction to men and women not to say
[15:01] I'll go back to the church and I'll
[15:02] renew my fellowship I'll sign a card
[15:04] that's all right but you can jarn the
[15:06] Masons odd fellas and anything you get
[15:08] the same results but when you come under
[15:11] God's pardoning atonement of the blood
[15:13] of Jesus Christ there's got to be a
[15:15] sincerity set in there God requires
[15:19] sincerity if it cost him such a price to
[15:21] give his only begotten son how are we
[15:24] going to get B under a little laughing
[15:26] uh Affair and come join church and make
[15:29] a decision card and take it into the
[15:31] church and whatever it might be that's
[15:32] not God's requirement he that goeth
[15:35] forth sowing in tears will doubtless
[15:37] return again rejoicing bringing with him
[15:39] precious sheep we need a sheep bringing
[15:42] people I heard the great evangelist say
[15:45] one time when I was tending one of his
[15:46] breakfast picked up the Bible and I
[15:48] always admired him he said here is the
[15:51] standard that's what God requires he
[15:54] said I'll go into a city I'll have a
[15:56] Revival said I'll have 20 or 30,000 make
[15:59] the decision I come back in about four
[16:01] or five years or maybe two years and
[16:03] said I can't find 15 or 20 said St Paul
[16:07] went into a city and he made one convert
[16:10] he come back in another year he had 30
[16:12] or 40 from that one then he said it's a
[16:14] lazy preachers that sat with their feet
[16:16] up on the desk and don't go out to see
[16:18] the people I admire his courage for Bing
[16:21] out his Brethren and things up on his
[16:23] conviction but I'd like to ask him this
[16:24] question what preacher told that one
[16:27] back there under Paul when there was no
[16:29] churches for him to go to what was it
[16:31] Paul taking him from a tradition or
[16:33] signing a card into the baptism of the
[16:35] Holy Ghost when he Soul was on fire for
[16:38] God he had to testify and say things his
[16:41] whole soul was a burning with a flame of
[16:44] fire that God had put in there what we
[16:46] need tonight is a sign that a man or
[16:50] woman is saved watch them go after other
[16:52] Souls as quick as he can he said one
[16:55] time that a bartender a little boy come
[16:58] in and said Mr your bartender he said
[17:00] yes Sunny said your sign is down he said
[17:03] uh well thank you Sunny so he walked
[17:05] outside and the little boy stood with
[17:07] his hands behind him and the bartender
[17:09] looked up and there was a great bar room
[17:11] on a big brass plate advertised he took
[17:13] his his uh Aon and polish just said
[17:15] Sunny you you're mistaken my sign's up
[17:18] he said no sir said it isn't said I mean
[17:20] your your best sign he said that's the
[17:23] best sign I got he said oh no look
[17:24] laying there and there they a drunk in
[17:26] the gutter that was the best sign he had
[17:28] yeah when he's seen a man under the
[17:30] influence of what he was studying on the
[17:32] inside and when we see a man under the
[17:36] influence of the Holy Spirit to tell his
[17:38] life are burning with oldfashioned
[17:40] Pentecostal power that's the best sign
[17:42] God ever had that that man is saved Ser
[17:46] it's the best sign now how will that
[17:49] come about not by joining church but by
[17:51] accepting his pardon through Jesus
[17:53] Christ your innocent subtitute no
[17:57] sincerity no real srow for sin he said
[18:01] he hide his face from their rituals
[18:03] their prayers were powerless they prayed
[18:06] oh sure they went up there and said
[18:08] their prayers they offered their
[18:09] sacrifice it become a farm do you know
[18:11] in 2 Timothy the 3r verse of the third
[18:14] chapter of second Timothy we're told the
[18:16] same thing that we'd get in the last
[18:17] days the Bible said here in the last
[18:19] days no this is the time will come when
[18:22] man be hey High minded lovers of
[18:24] pleasure more than lovers of God truce
[18:26] Breakers false accusers incontinent and
[18:28] despisers are those that are good having
[18:31] a form of
[18:34] godliness but denying the power there
[18:37] from such turn away for this is a sort
[18:40] that go from house to house and Lead
[18:41] silly women lay away with divers lust
[18:44] never ever learning and never able to
[18:45] come to the knowledge of the truth now
[18:48] if the Bible predicts that the hour
[18:50] would come when the church would get in
[18:52] the same tradition there was there by
[18:54] the rituals here it is
[18:56] again a traditional religion powerless
[19:00] oh you said them were Communists no they
[19:02] wasn't having a farm of godliness they
[19:05] go to church they draw on church and try
[19:07] to uh make along showing that they are
[19:10] go to church and things and go out and
[19:12] live different there's no fire in their
[19:14] soul there's nothing they're not
[19:15] interested in anybody else everybody
[19:17] else can die and go if they want to we
[19:19] feel that we're saved let the rest of
[19:20] them go that is real Christianity
[19:23] Christianity is go after the Lost go get
[19:27] that brother go do something about it
[19:29] can we stand and fold our hands even if
[19:32] we claim that we're saved and see men
[19:34] and women dying on every hands and this
[19:36] streets full of women going to churches
[19:39] with shs and and painted faces and and
[19:43] walking up and down the street with
[19:44] cigarettes in their hands and and paint
[19:47] all over their face it looks like I
[19:49] Foxes or Wolves or something and man
[19:52] walking up and down the street jining
[19:54] churches and things like that and call
[19:55] that Christianity and hold your peace
[19:57] what would St Paul do if he walked in
[19:59] Tucson I tell they'd have him in jail
[20:01] for morning that's right why his soul
[20:04] would burn for God tell he couldn't keep
[20:07] from doing it sure but we draw Church
[20:09] you see our Traditions has become
[20:11] extinct in the face of God what we need
[20:15] today is a prophet arise on the scene
[20:18] with thus sayth the Lord and strip those
[20:20] Saints to the bottom and say that they
[20:22] become a stink our denominations have
[20:25] grown and our churches are big and
[20:27] they're uh fighter than they ever was
[20:29] we'd be a lot better off with a tin pan
[20:31] standing on the Alley again with a
[20:33] guitar out there beating a drum or
[20:35] something other with the real
[20:37] Pentecostal fire burning in our souls
[20:39] and the set the great pews that we're
[20:40] setting in today
[20:43] Dy the world Hing under our feet yes sir
[20:47] God has a pardon and that pardon only
[20:49] through Jesus Christ education tradition
[20:52] denominational scientific nothing will
[20:55] ever take its place it's under that
[20:57] blood it's under the tradition not the
[20:59] tradition but under the blood of Jesus
[21:01] Christ God's provided way for Sinners
[21:04] the only way that we can ever meet I
[21:06] tell you you take a Methodist take a
[21:09] Baptist and a presbyterian and a
[21:10] Lutheran and a Pentecostal and let each
[21:12] one come under that blood they're
[21:15] Brothers there's no fussing about them
[21:17] man no Sirah they are brothers they see
[21:19] everything alike but you let a Methodist
[21:21] get to fussing with the Baptist on the
[21:23] order of baptism let a Oneness fuss with
[21:25] a trinity a trinity with a Oneness and
[21:27] whatever more watch the and hares but
[21:29] let them both come on the cross and

[21:46] Jesus Christ makes a Methodist Baptist
[21:48] Lutheran Presbyterian whatever he is my
[21:51] brother yes sir there's something in
[21:53] fellow because his spirit is is a
[21:56] brother he isn't a fusser and and
[21:58] something others he's a brother in
[22:00] Christ he believes every word that's in
[22:03] that Bible how can the Holy Spirit who
[22:05] wrote the Bible
[22:06] tonight how can the Holy Spirit living
[22:09] in a man saying oh that's for the
[22:11] disciples that Jesus said whosoever will
[22:14] Peter said the promises un to you and
[22:16] your children them as far off even as
[22:18] many as the Lord Our God shall call the
[22:20] Holy Ghost was for whoever God call amen
[22:25] here he said those who he predestinated
[22:27] he forne he are ordained and they
[22:29] accepted no man can come to me said
[22:31] Jesus except the father draws him and
[22:33] all that the father has given me will
[22:35] come to me do we come in a worked up
[22:37] emotion do we come to join the church do
[22:40] we come because we don't want to go to
[22:42] hell or do we come because we love God
[23:07] do we come in a worked up emotion do we
[23:09] come to join the church do we come
[23:11] because we don't want to go to hell or
[23:13] do we come because we love God that gave
