Jesus Oh my hands Hallelujah amen blessed Jesus hold my hand thank you musicians will change your order of the service praise the Lord amen you know until we unless we have a unless we have a all-night prayer meeting or we choose to just have a long prayer service we try to put a prayer service in like this whenever we feel there is a need praise the Lord and we don't have a day in a week I wish we had one day in a week that is just a prayer service day but since we don't have we just try to slide it in and try to keep up with the time as well praise the Lord and as as much we need prayer all the time praise the Lord so as much as we feel the need for the local assembly we will try to we'll try to do that praise the Lord so when you see me coming like this uh I just I just come and tell the the song leader that will be a prayer service tonight and then I sleep in and start the service with a prayer meeting and then go right into the songs and then we we let's take our Bibles tonight we've been talking on their Psalm uh chapter 8 what is man that they were mindful of him praise the Lord and uh and the son of man uh let's uh read Hebrew chapter one tonight let's read Hebrew chapter one we we look at that a little bit but we just I just want to to read that just for the scripture reading and then we will look into what we want to speak on tonight praise the lord it's going to be in the house of the Lord amen for all the ones that travel we say welcome back and we thank the Lord for granting you a safe travel praise the Lord good to see you same amen Hebrew chapter one let's read from verse 1. God who at Sandra time speak in time pass unto the father by the prophets have in this last day spoken unto us by his son whom he have appointed hearers of all things by whom also he made the words amen let's pray father we just want to ask your blessing tonight Lord and upon your this portion of the word that we have read and we just want to trust you for the leadership of your Holy Spirit into what we want to go into tonight we ask the father you'll come and just break the word Upon Us in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed I will read something from who is this Melchizedek and then I will take what I want to talk on tonight I will read a courtier from that message and then I will choose a phrase that I've taken out of there to speak on tonight praise the Lord now we see the attributes son of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body a Teo funny this body is subject to the word waiting for the earners change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son that's what I want to talk on tonight the difference between you and him as a son Jesus was a son and you are a son praise the Lord and you are Sons and Daughters there's a difference between him and you as a son that's why we want to look at tonight I'll take that again now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word and in Mophie body he came in and lived in that in the person of Manchester then later we never heard no more of my Casey deck because he became Jesus Christ the Jesus was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypassed that because in that form he know all things and you have never been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me you became from attributes to flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this every Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we have just become a flesh man not the word amen so just like I said tonight we want to take that little phrase the difference between him and you as a son amen praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight amen will you ask his blessing upon the word now we've been we've been talking about this uh Paul and Apostle Paul seven uh Paul The Prisoner it have led us into all of these different places we've been going [Music] but uh I choose to speak on this tonight just to be able to catch myself a little bit you know when you're talking on the subject and then you have a visiting preacher uh that comes in and he preach and you see how the holy spirit is dealing with the people you get a little bit distracted and you want to start looking into different things but I I want to trust the Lord just to keep stand still and see the glory of the Lord amen so I want to I want to try and find my way back to what we were talking about before and and I'm hoping that the Lord will make it a blessing we're talking about what is man that God has visited him now we were looking at that visitation in many different ways one of that is the gifts you know go visit us with gifts salvation is a visitation when the Bible says this is the day of your visitation this is the day of salvation it means that this is the day that God is visiting you amen praise the Lord [Music] so as we talk about that and uh and and all of the things uh now tonight what I want to do it on a little bit is is uh is to be able to bring us to the place to understand uh just like from the reading that we have just read we have not become the word yet we are going to that place amen we have not become the word there is you know we all can come from the same athlete father but there are ways that uh we will look different amen we look different we have some resemblance and there are ways that we look different so with the children of God this is the same praise the Lord our resemblance is not facial resemblance our resemblance is character praise the Lord our resemblance is character all of those men there in Antioch they were not from the same family but by their manner of Life they call them Christians because they were like Christ so our resemblance is character but yeah we learned from the book of Ephesians that God gave gifts by measure so we see that's that's the place also where we are different from one another because we have gifts by measure praise the Lord and uh so like we we said and we established all of God's children have gifts it's just the grace of God bringing us to the place for us to be able to recognize and identify uh where God is using us amen where God is using us and I believe that God is using every one of you praise the Lord hallelujah God is using us every day it is just for us to be able to identify where he's using us praise the Lord so that's that's what we want to look at tonight and we want to establish also as we look at that we want to establish the fact that because we have not come to become the word yet there is one thing that is required of us and that thing is that we have to be subject to the word praise the Lord because we have not become the fullness of the world for us to know everything amen so is required of us for us to bring this body subject to the word and every gift subject to the word that's why we want to establish and we because we had a guess on on Sunday uh if not I would have taken the time and uh uh uh we we saw the word uh uh the song leader called brother uh uh decimal to give a testimony and uh and and then he went into uh uh explaining the dream that he had and and all of that now what I want us to realize with that is that uh uh after the service I spoke with the brother I don't I don't think that the dream was wrong I don't think the message was wrong it was just the problem was the order the problem was the order and you see sometimes God will allow those things it's just like when God allowed mistakes in our lives praise the lord it's it's not it's not to to quench us no is to straighten us up so when those things happen in the local church it's not to kill gifts nor but it's to put them in order and support them in order because I believe that every one of you are gifted I'm not saying they are to to flatter you I'm saying that because it's the Bible truth amen when he extended on high the scripture says what he gave gifts to men even the Holy Ghost is a gift of God your salvation is a gift of God it's a free gift of God are we together praise the Lord now so I would take this I'll take this first question and answer and then uh be able to talk about that a little bit because I told October Desmond to write write that down and give it to me which of course he sent and then we'll find a time to to go over that again and read it to the church praise the Lord amen now you people that speak with tones brother Brandon you're talking to his church you people that speak with tones and hearts God gives of tongues God bless you you are needed in this Tabernacle praise the Lord amen you are needed in this Tabernacle that's what he said I want you here but now the thing is but now the thing is in order don't never do it while the preacher is preaching amen and you don't even give testimony why the songs is going on it's wrong is wrong that's not the other the song leader must not call for someone to give testimony when the song service is going on that's completely out of order now watch and see what the prophet of God was saying here he says here the uh now the thing is in order don't never do it while the preacher is preaching if you do you are out of order see you mustn't do it the Bible says the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet and when a man is preaching he got the flow he got the flow it's what the Holy Ghost is doing that moment when the sound service is going on is worship time they are moving are we together he got the flow he got the audience he's engaging the people the Holy Ghost is engaging the people that's why some Services is all about we are we have we are preparing our spirit we are lifting ourselves up you know brother bam talks about it just like the music he said we're going we're going to a higher octave okay we are lifting ourselves up we are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are trying to drop our mind from the things of the word and lift ourself up into uh the the the the the the the spirit of God to to be able to feel on the word amen now the preacher will be able to preach and the people will be able to respond back to the word so the song leader is he he had the audience praise the Lord and that's the reason why he must Engage The Audience now let's let's give a hint of praise to the Lord the people clap their hand praise the Lord let's lift our hands up you are engaging the audience you have the audience if you dump the people down the preacher would come and he will struggle it's all a spirit thing that is going on so while that is happening you can have somebody in your hands they are in the audience and that lift their instances I want to say something that song we sang just now it just spoke to my heart yeah as much as that is beautiful it's completely out of order it's out of all them praise the Lord when a man is preaching he got the floor he got the audience the Holy Spirit going to speak through him when he's finished then the time for the message what he's talking about here now is is if there is a message if there is a a message of Prophecy or a message of tongue because tongue is prophecy Tong is only not prophecy when there is no interpreter a tongue message that being interpreted is a prophecy to the church praise the Lord amen so God can choose to speak in an unknown language and anoint another person to interpret even sometimes the very person that speaks in tongues interpret their own tongues is biblical Paul said he that speak in tongues must pray for the spirit of interpretation because it has to be a prophecy a message to the church so brother Branham says after the preacher finished after he finished engaging the people and he had led the people over to the Holy Ghost now the Holy Spirit can bring a message in are we together praise the Lord now so you see what brother Branham used to do in the Tabernacle is the other the the the the people the high gifts will come together early before the service and they will pray they will wait on their gifts if there was a message for the church whether it was strong with interpretation or direct prophecy when it is given it will be recorded that is before the service just to avoid this interpreter I mean this this confusion because God is not the author of confusion those were some of the things that Paul put in order in the in the Church of Corinth so they will wait on their gifts and uh and and if there is a message the message will be giving the message will be recorded it will be given over to the pastor he looks over a he judge it by the word I think this is worth it to be read before the church he comes and read it that is before the service but while the service is going on because the gift is not only limited to that while the service is going on there can also be gifts in the church praise the Lord so you you will realize that if you if you really take notice of those things on the tip you will see even in the midst of the service you know sometimes when brother Branham is preaching when somebody is speaking in tongues the whole church go quiet praise the Lord and wait for the message to be given and after the message is giving if there is an interpretation the interpretation is received if there is not an interpretation brother brand will always allow the church to say the Lord's Prayer and they will pray together and then he will go on with his message or he will just say thank you Jesus if that is the end of the church end of the service he would just praise the Lord Lord you have spoken you know let your will be done in all of that [Music] so uh if a man is preaching he got the flow he got the audience the Holy Spirit going to speak through him when he is finished then the time for the message you see so don't get out of order if you do then you interrupt and you grieve the holy spirit with the message that is going forth praise the Lord amen now what happened also is the other that we don't that we that we should realize is that uh the the uh the prophet of God make us to know every every every every birth is a mess so when gifts are being born among the people it can be a mess amen we will never be able to do it in order if we try to just imitate to do it in order we will be impersonating but when those things are done we must find the grace to be able to come back to the word and find the right way to do it if not if we stay in our mess we keep getting messy and keep messy and messing and everything get messy praise the Lord we must always find our way back that's what those those cherubim was fall to lead us back to the tree of life we must always find our way back to the word of God praise the Lord because our birth is different from him even Adam birth was different from Jesus birth because Adam came as a full man he was now born as a baby so he don't have never because the neighbor is the connection of the child to the mother Adam never had a neighbor because God brought him as a full man he never needed a mother because there was not a womb for him to be in so his birth was different from Jesus birth God in flesh Jesus he had to be in a womb nine months he had to come as a baby so you think about it now the almighty God coming down in in in Emma form talk about it and that is the same way with each and every one of us when we get that New Birth we have to come as a baby we will have to grow we will have to grow that is the place where many people stumble and and struggle because the way you understand the Holy Ghost you are relating it to Adam's birth and not to Christ's birth you are relating it to Adam birth that when you have the holy God you need to do everything right you need to be standing up like a man you no that was Adam's birth he came as a full man praise the Lord in Saint Luke the Bible says and the child grewed and the child growled Hebrew Paul says and he learned obedience it's all of the things that is in growth we have to learn praise the Lord and when we grow we struggle we stumble we fall we fall down we get up we cross we hold things until we can find our 14. are we together amen you see because as we grow and when we stumble it says oh no you know I I I stumbled and fell so I didn't have the Holy Ghost that's that's a misunderstanding that's a complete misunderstanding because your very birth from the beginning is Birth by the Holy Ghost because no man can call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is the one that starts the very beginning that initiate the work in you most of the time we try to be possessor of hate and want to claim it as our own work our own righteousness that's the reason why we get to those places are we together I have another quote here that I wanted to share with you it is the reason of the Sun now when you give the Dynamics you have been quaking from Malta to immortality it makes the whole body become subject to the word now that's that is the emphasis we we're trying to do it on tonight uh is is to be subject to the word amen that's what the Holy Ghost is doing because because uh uh uh we are met the forward yet amen so the Holy Ghost In You brings your body subject to the word it brings your desire subject to the word it brings your thoughts subject to the word we will know all things the Bible says we will know uh we will know him as we are known amen and uh we we read who is that because he said that he had a little bit you will look back in their body when you become the forward you will now look back and understand those things in your life that you did not understand are we together praise the Lord when the first son came when God expressed his first son Adam he brought him in his image a false stature a man Cho's son God braved into the nostril of of Adam we read the area many times a question and answer on Genesis but I'm saying he told was stuck in the earth and and you know as as a root and and he was he was he was upright uh Ecclesiastes says God made man upright so when God made Adam he was upright God was not doing CPR on the ground Adam was upright and when God breath into his nostril as the Breath of Life as a living Soul Adam just shake his toes out of the earth and he went right on doing the word of speaking things he was a mature son he never had time to learn he just kicked his legs of the earth and on his category naming the animals and just doing what was pleasing to the father because he was born a man chosen but yet when it speaks of Jesus it says he learned obedience by the many things he suffer and how did it come because he was put into existing element body praise the Lord he was subject to this body he was subject to our birth even though he was not born insane praise the Lord that's the reason why it shouldn't surprise you Jesus says the disciple asked him he says uh no man no not even the son only the father they should not shock you because he was in a body he says I do I do these things as as my Father revealed into me praise the Lord so you see honor thy son honor honor that song the the the the the the the stature of his birth and growth that's that's what is bringing every one of us on to Redemption praise the Lord that's what is bringing every one of us onto Redemption so we have to we have to make this provision in our own life the provision to grow the provision to learn if not we will make the very same mistake the church made All Through the Ages I have the Holy Ghost they take that as a a state of perfection praise the Lord amen they take that as a state of perfection I hope you'll be able to understand me when I say this there were two perfect men that God made in the beginning one was Adam he was made perfect perfect in the sense that he was made as a mature son like we would say amen the second perfect man that God made in the beginning was Lucifer in Isaiah the Bible says he was created perfect imperfection and his perfection was in a sense that he was designed perfectly to carry out what he was ordained to carry out amen he was designed to be a perfect Deceiver he was designed to be a perfect liar so you see your Perfection and my perfection is not seen less Perfection like brother Branham said our Perfection is not seamless perfection be ye perfect as the father is perfect it's not sinless Perfection is growing on to maturity because if you look at that word Perfection it also means a mature person amen Saturn was made perfect that he would he would he would he was never going to miss his work he was going to do it toward the point he was designed and he was made that way he was never going to miss his work he was going to carry out just as God designed him the Bible say in him was perfection amen you see that's the reason why if we strive for sinless perfection you will always fail amen you will always feel if we strive for sinless Perfection because that is not the Perfection that God designed for you and myself praise the Lord if we were to come sinless Perfection we were not supposed to be born in sin praise the Lord we were not supposed to be born in sin even the man that God made in a mature State because of God's Plan of Redemption he stayed for because God had a plan in his mind are we together so we read that again now uh it's a reason of the sun you gather Dynamics you have been quaking from Mortal to immortality you have been quaking from Mortal to immortality what is happening there is in your soul your body is not immortality yet it's your soul that has been quickened from Mortal to immortality now your support value on internal things amen your body still struggle yeah your borders take their sake it gets weak it gets hungry about your soul puts value on internal things because in you the quickening power has risen your hairs up you are looking to a new body you are looking to a New Kingdom you are looking to a new world to come are we together it makes the whole body come subject to the word it makes the whole body comes subject toward the word praise the Lord it makes the whole body that's what that quickening power will do that's what I said the Holy Ghost will brings you your body your desire everything subject to the word amen it will make you a different it will make you look different it will make you live different it will just make you different praise the Lord Hallelujah are we together now you see all all of those differences that that it produces is the character from inside praise the Lord now how can you claim to have the spirit and throw yourself away from the word because what the Holy Ghost will do it will bring you subject to the word it will bring you subject to the word you're going to say Amen to every word amen even if it's against your best judgment you will say Amen to the word are we together you will say Amen to the word praise the Lord God provided a place of worship Ephesians 4 30 grieve now the holy the the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the dead of your Redemption argue with him not me that's what it says I'm reading it you are sealed until the day of your Redemption until the day that Jesus comes for you praise the Lord then think of age you are then not yourself you are a new creature or the Greek their means and New Creation you have become re-created again the power of God comes upon you and you be you become created a new creature which brings the whole physical being spiritual being in everything in subject to the word of God that's the Christian Life the Christian life is not the impression we give others the Christian Life is how much we bring in ourselves subject to the word that's that's the Christian Life that's your battle how much can you bring yourself subject to the word how much can you identify that the word of God says this and my desire is contrary to it Lord I want to bring myself subject to the word are we together that's the Christian Life That's the overcoming powers yeah thank you have a bunch of video [Music] the Christian Life That's the overcoming power everything physical everything's spiritual everything is it's not about convincing others and then making making others to know I'm I'm a Christian it will flow naturally you will not have to struggle praise the Lord because no matter how much impression we try to give to people you have to remember as God that do the convicting is God that conveys the heart of man that this woman is a different person that this God is a different person it's neither sure that we put up it's God that conveys the heart of men I'm trying I'm struggling in myself to bring myself subject to God and God is using that to witness to someone else that that's my son you see how she's living that's my daughter praise the Lord but you see that we have the whole thing in Reverse we want to convince people that we are Christian amen we want to impress them I said only because I'm a Christian if I was not a Christian then this is something completely different amen you have your hands too much on the Wheel praise the Lord you have your hands too much on the wheel app I read a testimony this week that just blessed my heart bless my heart and it just keeps speaking to my mind so I can't help but tell you what the testimony was praise the Lord this Minister forgotten his name now and uh the preacher then and he was just preaching on faith he was preaching on Fading and you know and preaching on the manifestation of God and preaching on God you know we're blessing his people and God moving on the people and God answer prayers [Music] in writing that time his son got sick this is this is a life story this is not a facial story demand it's a life story this is a testimony it's his own testimony his son got sick and then he was you know he he got on the phone and then you know he called the hospital he was in a village place you know this this is somewhere uh uh this was somewhere in the 1700s so you you can just just think about what that was you know just one one uh telephone you know and in all of that in in the place and uh so he called the hospital or caught in town and asked if the doctor was in town they said no the doctor was not there so he was calling the neighboring towns you know calling the neighbor in town he would call this place and asked he said no the actor is not there call this other place and asked he says no doctor is not there call this other place and ask and it just dawned on him after he tried calling calling calling it just dawned on him they have just been preaching on faith trust God praise the Lord so he just said back to to relax and meditate on that the phone rang and as soon as he pick up the form the thing he heard was I'm glad you are off the phone why because they've been trying to get a hold of him but he was so busy trying to get a hold of the doctor this person was trying to get a hold of him but he was so busy on the phone trying to call here trying to call you trying to call here praise the Lord so as soon as he picked up the phone what he had was I'm glad you are off the phone because I just got the news that a doctor has got to your village praise the Lord amen and and as the conversation went on he uh uh uh was trying to get the address of the doctor and the President says uh let me give you the address they said yeah let me get a PIN to write it down as they were given the address he realized it was just the next door neighbor praise the Lord if we can just get off the phone the answer is very close praise the Lord it just it just can't leave my mind I just uh since how amazing God is if you can just get off the phone your answer is might be very close praise the Lord so you see that's that's that's the whole thing about the Christian Life that's the overcoming power bringing yourself subject that's all we are called to do that's what we are called to do bring yourself subject to the word praise the Lord amen so you see whenever it starts to become a problem for a person bringing their desires of bringing their choice of bringing their gifts subject to the word then you have to you have to wash that now you have to wash there because I would remind you tonight the devil is also gifted praise the Lord oh yeah he's gifted he's very very gifted and you know another thing he knows gifted people he knows gift to people he is gifted he knows gift to people so if he can be able to put a a mark upon your life that he can be able to do something that will just discourage you for thy gift in your life not to operate that's all he needs to do he don't need to keep you out of church with the devil he just won the church to be full he wants this place to turn to Amiga church if we can just get away from the word and allow everything to happen everybody come you know we just allow everything to happen we have tennis boy yeah we have basketball court right in here you know we can have birthday party it does not bother the devil praise the Lord while he fights against uh what he's fighting the Target of the anime is to just make the word of God of no effect that's all he want to do just kill the effect of the word in your life that no matter how loud the preacher preached it does not bother you no matter how quiet he preached it does not bother you praise the Lord nothing speaks to your conscience not nothing touch your heart glory be to God he can just keep you in the form that's why Paul said in the form of godliness by the power is dead if he can just keep us in the form of godliness in the form of a church Wednesday night in the form of Sunday morning we come in our best and just kill the effect of the word let's just please the people why do people want to do less let appeal to the people what do you think what do you think we can do to make this church a good church let everybody bring their suggestion I'm telling you even if we try we will not please every one of you even if we try it we will not please you because pretty soon you will think that we're taking this person under suggestion better than you let's stay with the word people let's stay with the word they stay with the word that's that's that's all that's all that's what the Christian Life is bringing ourselves subject every day bringing ourselves subject every day praise the Lord you know what uh one day in a week uh and always is warm here for you I also let you go praise the Lord when they start opening the windows then it's serious foreign you get the emphasis tonight that's the difference between him being a son and you a son he came the word what was that word a virgin shall conceive Jesus was the seed of the woman he came that word and you are also you you are also coming the word I will have a bride with a spot of wrinkle who was God talking about you you are Thy Word unless you don't believe it if you don't believe it there's no need of you being here tonight praise the Lord I will have a bride with our spot a raincoat you are that one I would call the people out of the Gentiles it was speaking about you praise the Lord you see Jesus coming directly not being born of a man or a woman he was birthed by God coming that way at 12 years old he was able to go right into the temple and he says I should be here by my father business at 12 years old I don't know what you were doing I don't know what I was doing but sure I was not about the father's business praise the Lord so what am I trying to say that you know he could recognize it because he was born directly in a line

don't know whether you added to the sun whatever it takes to draw closer to you Lord foreign can you put that up for me we have to realize that we are work in progress amen that God is working on us he's shipping us he's bringing us to the place where he wants us to be to be son and daughter of God manifested praise the Lord the devil might put you to the corner or he might make you to stumble and all he wants you to do is to just is to just miss your identity he just warned you to miss your identity what you are called for what you supposed to be doing he wants you to to focus on you know on on your weakness on your failures it have already been there that's what God is calling you out of praise the Lord so let me focus on what God is doing now in my life praise the Lord let's just
