========================================

now would you raise your hand time lord bless you our heavenly father we are so thankful for your presence and for honest hearted people who really believe that that you are coming and they they must make ready for this great event that the whole world has waited for all these thousands of years and we're living just as it was watching time and history run out in eternity beginning to move in and we see this appearing so our hearts are strangely warm and we pray father that you search our hearts tonight and tries and if there be any sin in us lord take it out we have noticed this week in your great presence as we've watched you over this among this congregation going right down and digging out the very thoughts of the heart and revealing it to us telling us these things now tonight lord we want our hearts to be true and right with you we pray that you'll bless here upon the platform of the pulpit has been placed a box of handkerchiefs little parcels that's going to the needy i pray heavenly father as as they're sent from this place where prayer has been made and faith to believe god that that every handkerchief here and every uh little cloth and parcel that touches the sick may they be healed because this audience and we together are asking in one accord that you will heal them father it's a memorial that we have asked you said ask and you shall receive and when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for i believe lord we all believe and it's been asked now let it be done for the kingdom of god's sake for we asked it in jesus name amen well it's certainly good to be back at the at the auditorium again tonight and under great expectations for the lord to visit us tonight as we've set this night aside from praying for the sick to the to seeking salvation for our souls each one of us needs to rededicate our lives anew and this week we have seen the presence of jesus christ the vindicated scripture him right here among us watching what he did the same things that he did on earth when he was here before he doing it just the same have we seen the ministry as it's climbing just like we're growing into a perfect day a perfect church we started out just like like we were saying this morning in our lovely little fellowship this morning we certainly had a wonderful time at that breakfast i think the brethren for their fine cooperation i got to shake the hands of many of them these fine man that's sponsoring this meeting uh bringing us in here it shows that they're interested in their people they're shepherds and interested in their sheep and so i'm i'm grateful that some of these uh any shepherd is interested in getting his sheep with vitamins and these are spiritual vitamins as it was it helps the sheep to grow into strong faith in our god and so i appreciate such man and now speaking this morning on a thought of the church growing see coming like a seed in the ground and that seed as this plant it grows from glory unto glory and it becomes after a while into a blossom and then goes back to the seed that's like the original seed that was planted and so has the church been the church age started in this last days after the dark ages it started with martin luther in the reformation preaching justification by faith after his time and they organized the church it died out and then there comes swingly after lutheran swing they didn't even believe in the virgin birth he went over into switzerland they still don't believe and the swingly doctrine do not believe that jesus was virgin born they said he was the son of joseph call the son of god but that takes the whole prophet from under the whole foundation of christianity he was virgin born or he is just a man like you or i he was the son of god and then after that come calvin and on and on finally the church got in such a condition their kind had to have another reformation and god sent john wesley with a message of sanctification cleansiness of the spirit and then he and whitfield and many of them went on in the great reformation and asbury that comes in the united states and that great revival saved england and the world at that time what did they do after them founders died out they began to organize upon their doctrine and the first thing you know they made an organization then we had others break off america such as alexander campbell john smith from the baptist church and so forth and then the nazarene pilgrim holiness and others come on and then come the great reformation again pentecost coming out of those organizations with the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues divine healing great miracles and signs come off that went for a long time it's been 50 about 58 years now since the holy spirit began to fall on old azusa street out in california you're in the united states where it started falling the great time come then what did pentecost do one made him an organization one said he's coming on a white horse another in a white cloud and a way they went organizations and split up breaking up the brotherhood among the people and just like israel little did israel know that when they were shouting the victory on the bank of the river they were only about four days journey about 40 miles away from the promised land they didn't realize they were 40 years it would take them but what was it grace had provided them a prophet a pillar of fire a sacrificed land a deliverance and still they wanted a law they wanted something they could have something to do into they want to put their hands to it that's the most rational mistake they ever made in exodus 19 when israel rejected grace and accepted law and then what did they do he just let them stay right there in the wilderness for 40 years they plant vineyards and they eat fruit and they married wives they raised children until that old generation died off and another generation come on 40 years later and not hardly 40 hours away but had to wait for 40 years before they went over and then a new leader came in joshua and they moved on into the land with the new group now i think it's a very beautiful type here that we find out long ago when our forefathers in the pentecost they raised up they had the old general counsel from that form of the assemblies of god out of that come the ubc and then united and so forth through got an organization after organizations fussing and fighting god just let them sit right there merry wives raise children speak in tongues shout the spirit but now there's a new group come up they were only just a few days from the promised land all these blessings they had was fine but you remember the whole land belonged to them now we're fixing to go into the promised land so may the lord help us as we look upon these things just like the pyramid did you notice how the pyramid was made not a pyramid doctrine now mr pyramid look on your one dollar bill the seal of the united states is that eagle well why does this say over there on the pier made the great seal why would it be greater here in the united states and and the seal of the united states the great seal the eye watching and the the capstone that goes upon the pyramid was it was rejected it never was on the pyramid isn't to this day the stone of scrolling they claimed but it never was put on the capstone why on enoch and them in the early days built the pyramids down in egypt we find out that in there they knew that the cornerstone of the capstone would be rejected and that pyramid is put so perfectly together too they don't need martyr it was so mechanically hewed out until one stone fits against the other so tight you can't even put a razor blade between them now it's kept creeping up and now it's all honed off on top ready for the capstone when it will come that's the way god's brought his church from justification sanctification baptism the holy spirit and now the ministry of the spirit which is the what quickens the word that ministry in the church will have to be just exactly like this just like this when my shadow here of my hand if i never see my hand seen the shadow it's kind of it gets pale as it gets away but it gets closer and closer the negative and positive are coming together until they both become the same thing and that's exactly when the church and the word has to be one like jesus and god was one just exactly the god has was in christ reconciling the world to himself and so will christ have to be in the church the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled and that's a capstone that comes upon the last church age the not the lady will see it now it's a calling out of that a bride out of a church church out of a church and otherwise it's like he called a nation out of a nation in egypt and now we're living in that day and we're grateful for these great things that we've been seeing now tomorrow afternoon the lord willing is going to be the closing of this service uh this part of the service and we're going to designate that all together for praying for the sick and everybody that wants to be prayed for may come out and get a prayer card to come through the prayer line now the reason we get prayer cards on these is keep them lined up and then if you don't they just keep passing around around around and see if they so you we give them a prayer card you have a prayer card you come in the line and you'll see and believe you'll see the glory of god take place it'll be great and now we thank you for all that you have done and for the great welcome that we've had amongst these ministry brothers and so forth now tomorrow is sunday and these churches will be open there'll be no service here tomorrow morning to be sunday school and you visitors i've got some friends in here myself at uh it's with us in a party and some has come down from my hometown um here to be with us now these are the man that sponsors this meeting they believe this type of meeting if i lived here in this city i'd belong to one of their churches i certainly would because they believe the same thing that i believe and i belong to one of their churches if i lived here and you gave your life to christ this week and you don't have a church home why don't you talk it over with them they believe this same thing or they wouldn't be sitting up here represented see so now you you you find your nice one these nice churches tomorrow and go to it and i'm sure they'll do you good they'll help you they'll help you to believe it if you haven't been baptized ask them if you haven't received the holy ghost ask them about it and they'll help you right on through to christ and shepherd you right on down the road until he returns now the lord bless each one of you and now you know the presbyterians are always raising up and setting down they say and i'm not a presbyterian but i do believe that when we read the word we ought to stand because it's an honor to god to stand is like we salute the flag or pledge allegiance or what more and now for tonight i have chosen some scripture reading here out of the book of saint luke the seventh chapter beginning with the 36th verse and now all week long i've been working on a a thought that come to me on the road coming down here on the unveiling of the mighty god but when i got through looking at my scriptures and things i had nearly 20 pages so i never get through that no hour here so i thought i'd have to change it tonight so i have i believe it's will of the lord and i say these things now in seventh chapter of saint luke and the 36th verse one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an ambassador box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharisee which had been him saw it he spake within himself remember not out loud within himself saying if this man was a prophet he would know who and what manner of woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner and jesus answered and said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he said master sayon there was a certain creditor which had two debtors and they owed one owed 500 pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave the most and he said unto him thou as rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thy house thou giveth me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and has wiped them with the hairs of her head and thou giveth me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with all thou didst not anoint but this woman has a anointed my feet with oral wherefore i say unto her i say unto thee her sins which were many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth a little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that set at me with him begin to say within themselves who is this that forgive us sins also and he said to the woman thy faith is say thee go in peace let us pray lord jesus this story has taken place many years ago but it's a true story for it is written in the pages of our bible and we know that it's true and now we would by no means try to portray this again tonight but we would like for you to help us to bring this as a message tonight to the people that they might see that that you're still the same lord jesus and we pray for your blessings upon us all as we are needy people we have need of the lord and we believe tonight though we see you make the blind to see and the deaf to hear and the lame to walk and by doctor's statements i've seen you raise up five people from the dead in different times different nations but yet lord i believe the most sickest thing i know of tonight is the body of christ here on earth the church it's really safe heal it tonight lord this potion that sets your together this this bunch of sojourning here in in tampa this lovely bunch of people lord heal every womb tonight let the spirit grant this to us for we asked it in jesus name and for his honor for his glory here in this city or we are a journey amen i should call it now just for a few moments and i'm trying not each night i have to apologize to you because it you've been so nice and i you're such an easy audience to preach to you just don't know when to stop and that makes the minister know that you're feeding or receiving the words that i'm saying and i'll come to you on a bit i'm the tardis i've ever been and i don't know when see i haven't let up since christmas i'm going right from here to tucson to start again come right from there to go to british columbia to baptize a whole tribe of indians that are led to christ were formerly catholic last fall was on a hunting trip and the whole group gave their heart to christ by the healing of the mother one of the mothers that the doctors no one could touch her she's laying dying and they want me to come back as soon as the ice gets melted so it gets 85 below zero there and so and i smell it i'm taking them and all a great bunch of trappers and hunters up and down alaskan highway are all meeting with me to be baptized and accepting christ they seen the lord show a vision of a certain thing where a certain bear would be how much he'd weigh what kind he was and where a certain animal would be staying who would be there and what to be wearing and all about it and told him before it happened and they said it's not even that kind of things in this country and we went right straight to it and happened word by word the trophies hangs in my room today they said we want to be baptized too rough man but you know he's got seed laying everywhere my subject tonight is jesus keeps all his appointments i want you to bear that on mine as we speak and i i won't talk too long and i want you to think it over now that remember you've got to meet this one that's present with us tonight someday now it must have been almost sundown when our sitting starts out tonight it must have been about sundown and this courier had run all day maybe two or three days he was trying to find him he went down maybe almost from dan to besheba because jesus in his ministry was going to speak here perform his signs and wonders and the people are all together he would take off somewhere else i must go to another city and it had a hard time perhaps it went over to capernaum and they said well he left here a week ago we don't know exactly where he went but he went somewhere else and he oh he was tired his hair was wet was perspiration his legs were dusty and sweaty and as he come up into the party where jesus had been speaking and jesus also was tired he'd been speaking all day his mouth was dry from much speaking and his hands began to look trembling and his eyes weary as the sun began to sink and he wanted to see jesus he had a message for him and now jesus had 12 men around him that kept the people away from him uh of course he just coming up on him and so they i'm making this in a drama so that everybody can catch it and so we find that in this jesus man he must have come let's say he come to philip and philip might have said something like this a sir or young fella we would certainly like to let you see the master but but he's so tired we just got to watch him because he he just goes to the almost drops and we've been in so many meetings and so forth lately i'm sorry i don't believe we can do it but he says i i have a note here that comes from a very important man in religious realms and it's an invitation for your master which will be a great a great thing if if he shall go and i'm a scene because i've been commissioned that i must take this note to him and see that he gets it personally so finally if they tuck him up to the lord jesus and while he was uh looking at him the lord jesus perhaps leaving his place pulpit from where he was speaking or the disciples and them had fixed for him to talk from as he was looking why he looked upon the young man he must have liked him and the young man told him he said i am on a errand sir and there's a very high ranking man down in a certain city and he's a pharisee the strictest of the religions and he's uh he's making a dinner a great uh time of banquet and he wants you to come to be the guest of honor and he's uh manny would like to attain this banquet but he has selected you and i've been three days trying to find you across the country and i was certainly happy to get your sir i'll deliver this note to you from it and from him and he took the note and read it and you find out that this certain pharisee had was making a feast and and had bid him to come down and be a guest of honor with him so jesus standing for a few moments and looking at the young man and yet as busy as he was but you can never invite him but what he'll come i don't care what the situation is he'll come he uh said you tell your your master that i'll be there on this certain day at this certain time i'll be there and the courier must have smile satisfied and turned away and run off down the hill to take the good news back to his master that he had succeeded in getting the message to this one that he wanted what was the matter with that courier how could it be was he conscious of what he done the first time maybe in his life that he ever stood in the presence of jesus and never even asked forgiveness of his sins he never he never took the opportunity oh how it's the same way with people today many times they they're realize that they're in his presence and and never ask forgiveness well that he maybe never presented the opportunity another time and turned down his last opportunity to ask forgiveness how could he ever have done that how could this boy ever so been wrapped up and bringing this message from his master that he failed in the presence of the son of god that asked forgiveness it was all a business affair and you know that's something like the people today church christ has become a a business affair or or social affair to john church and get just a a a little better social standing for your business or something to stand out a little better in the neighborhood it is the thing of of really coming and repenting like a sinner should do many times in church people are brought right in the presence of christ and turn away and do his rational thing as this courier uh did oh he should have fell upon his knees and when he first realized that it was who he was and he's saying master i have a message for you but first i want you to forgive me that would have been the right approach and then if there's any business to be done let that be done later but to first get his own soul right with god that's why i think so much healing becomes a failure or professed healing because the first place the people are not ready for healing they won't confess they're wrong the bible said confess your faults one to another and pray one for the other and we're not willing to do that if we can take the healing and go ahead and go on back and do what we was doing they would accept that but when it comes to really first coming and getting right with god people don't want to do that and that's the reason it throws a a bad a damper over divine healing you see so many people that walk in like it and walk out and don't and god knows all about those things now this fellow made a real rational thing we would think we would think if i could only take his place if i could go up before his throne and and take a message the first thing i would do what would you do be interested in what your organization has sent you up there to find out about or would you be looking around and see how heaven was decorated or in his presence with the first thing you say lord god forgive me a sinner that would be the right thing to do now as jesus watched the boy and as he went away might come in his mind why didn't that boy do that was because he wasn't conscious who that was may i say this not sacrilegious may i say this not because it's this meeting or any meeting but i think that's what's the matter today people are not conscious of it they see the scripture exactly identified but they're not conscious of who it is they'll see something and they say oh that was wonderful that was fun but you're not conscious of what it is if it was there'd be a repentance going on weeping and crying the city would have such a revival to half of you be locked up before morning it's right if we be conscious of what it is and we pass by many times and miss the opportunity but not being conscious i don't think the boy really realized he'd been raised up among this pharisee which was a a great ruler a prince or a religious man and he had been raised up with him and and just took his side of religion and the pharisee had laughed at jesus and made fun of him or something they did as they in that day [Music] you
