e he to it they know how to do it and there's a key to knowledge a man after knowledge there's a key to science the scientific researches now there's that's a great key people look for that key like here some time ago they found an atom and know that there was atoms and then the atoms form molecules and so forth now they got to searching someone believed if that Adam held everything together if the Adam could be turned around that would take that what it's holding and break it apart because everything is held up by Adam we know that now the post is held with atoms you're held together with atoms the grass the trees everything is to held together with Adams well if that Adam turning all one way if it can be broken and turned back then it would destroy and now great scientists believe that that could be done and they worked and they worked and they s hour after hour and week after week year after year until finally they conquered it yeah it was I believe Thomas Edison on the uh life that they say the man had a knowledge that he could make electricity light he's the inventor of the light bulb and he wouldn't even go to bed at night he would take a sandwich in his hand and eat his meal and sit there and figure and work somewhere way back in the back of his mind something told him he could do it what is it it's a key that can open up the way not many years ago there was a a man that he believed that he had a talent to write comic strips he believed he held the key in his hand and he wanted he went he lived in Kansas he went to the editor of the Great paper in Kansas City and took some of his writings in and the editor said sir you just haven't got it uh you there's no need of trying you you can't do it but that didn't satisfy him he know he had it and he went back again and again trying but he the editor would turn him down finally he went to other places and they turned him down saying Mister you just haven't got it you can't do it but yet he believed he could do it that's the way he's got something in his hand finally he got the job of writing some little uh uh script for uh I believe an editorial or something for a church some sort of a little comic strip for a church and and he red himself a little rat or mice invested garage where the mice is running all over the place and everything in his sheets and uh he got to uh noticing a peculiarity of a certain little mouse there's where the story of Mickey Mouse was born now it's a malted millionaire as Walt Disney why he had something in his hand and he know he held it he know he could do it that's way every great achievement is made when man and women have something in their hand that they know they can do it when polio struck the nation as we're all commanded now to go get this vaccine to stamp it out when polio struck yesterday I was listening to a doctor as I was driving over the road some doctor from Louisville he said a few years ago when the Great Plague hit Louisville said if man would have stood where I did and saw 57 respirators at one time and man women boys and girls paralyzed with a disease called polio and there was was nothing could be done about it said I never want to see a thing like that again but science thought if there is such an evil as polio there surely is something to counteract it they F they stood on the streets with boots with firemen they put hats out and they begged they bumed they've done everything trying to find the key that unlocked the door to Liberty finally one Christian gentleman by the name of salt found the vaccine while there was an evil estate there was a killer at State there was a key somewhere that could unlock Freedom again for man and the salt vaccine was the great treatment oh what the key can do the vaccine was brought forth and now stamping out the polio with this vaccine because that it was a never tiring and never give up that key laid somewhere there was something would inoculate from it and they were determined to find it and if there is such an evil as polio dpia small poox yellow fever tus lock jaw and so forth that science these evils has been able to fight day and night till they found an inoculation from it because it's evil it's a killer how much more is our a key to Salvation for a man that's in prison House of sin amen there is a key to that door to liberate man from it a tree key usually when uh it's turns the lock and when you find a key it's got to be to some treasure something is worthwhile or you wouldn't even lock it up if it ain't worth locking up it's Let It Go but when it's worth locking up so key usually is the the note to something or the way to enter to something is worthwhile the key that's what it's for now it unlocks something that's worthwhile now we read in St John the 10th chapter Jesus said I am the door to the Sheepfold I am the door amen not a door for the door amen the only door I am the way amen the only way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me amen I am the door to the Sheepfold and all that comes before me is enemies thieves and robbers he is the door door to the Sheepfold he is the door to Salvation there's not another name given under heaven whereby you must be saved only through the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah no church no denomination no Creed no doctrines of anything only through Jesus name Hallelujah that is the that is the key amen no wonder if Peter could use one of them on the day of Pentecost they wanted to know how to get into that door he used the key and there's only one key because there's just one door I am the door and Peter had the key to it and he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the Commission of your sin and you shall receive the treasures of God Amen it's the key to the door and Jesus is the door there's only one door to healing and Jesus is that door there's only one door to peace I my peace I give unto you he's only one door to genuine peace Hallelujah you might think you got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your home you might accumulate enough money to get your children clothes have food to eat but you might have uh accumulate enough popularity to be popular amongst people but when you slip off your shoes at night am and get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace that is if you know you were dying that night there's only one piece and that's Jesus is the peace oh Hallelujah he is our peace yes he is our healing I'm the Lord thy God and heals all of your diseases he is the door to heaven and there's no other door or no other way but through Jesus Christ he is the Door to Heaven Hallelujah and now Jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door amen now if Jesus is the door to all these promises of God am faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God prise our go Hallelujah key is Faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of Faith does that faith in his finished work it's these keys that we're speaking of now in Hebrews the 11th chapter I got a great string of them wrote down here of these Heroes of Faith amen it was the key to to the door that stopped the mouth of Lies amen it was a key faith that unlocked the prison houses it was Faith the key of faith that quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword amen BR the dead back to life again it was Faith the key of faith in the Living God that hand that man that woman who can take that key of Faith they can unlock every promise God made Hallelujah but if you haven't got that key you're just progan you'll never unlock it you'll beat against it because this key any correct made key has levers on the inside the lot and it takes a certain form a certain shape of them keys to turn those levers amen and just one little lever out of the way will mess the whole thing up amen therefore I believe in the Full Gospel every word of God that turns the power of God Loos amen hallelujah Hallelujah that turns his blessings to the people oh it's the key to the door Hallelujah that unlocks it all those great Heroes those prophets and great man of the Bible that had that key yes amen that's the reason they could stop the mouth of Lies quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword bring the dead back to life again and do all kinds of Miracles is because they help that key and they know it worked amen because it was a scripture born key amen now if I'm pring with a Creed key I don't know what it's going to do if they say my church teaches this I don't know about that but when the Bible teaches it Oh Glory and I hold a faith key in my hand or in my heart amen that says that's God's word that'll quench the violence of fire yes amen it'll unlock healing for the sick it'll unlock salvation to the Lost amen I have to come to the door everything's in his name whatever you do in word or deed do it all in his name knowing that the key that you got is Faith because it's a scripture made key amen now if it's a Creed key denominational key I don't know what it'll do but if it's a scriptural key it'll unlock because God said so amen now oh no wonder they can stop the balance of fire and so forth they had the key God's first nod to one of those Prophets nothing could stop him oh amen he didn't have to do like he does to me sometime pound it over and over and perhaps you I hope not but keep telling you go do this and then you stumble along and go do this and go back and do it again you didn't do it right just one little knob hey just they could just feel the spirit tell them it's a thing to do and nothing's going to stop them they they they stopped the mouth of nine amen they scaped the edge of the sword they quenched fire they done everything just a little nod from God because they help the key in their hand Hallelujah that great faith oh Hallelujah they've done things for God because nothing would stop them oh how glorious like the young man one time came up to a an old brother that was a Godly old man an old prophet of God and he heard that man constantly testify constantly telling about the goodness of God and how that God was and what Christ was and just going ahead speaking finally this young man was going to be ordained in the ministry so he came up to this certain old sage and he said to him sir I want to ask you a question he said ask on young man he said does Christ literally mean as much to you as you say it does he said he means more to me than what I could ever have breath to speak there you are what was it he' found a key that young man said upon that if you claim these things and you say to me that there is real as you then I want to know that same Jesus in the same reality what was it he know the old man had a hold of a key that he could unlock and could lock up you know a key that locks unlocks too see you can loosen arbine that's right the same key that locks unlocks the key that unlocks can lock up yes exactly see because it works both ways how pitiful it is that the church has ever lost its vision of that What a Sad thing it was when the church sold itself out to create S as we've done today and now called and unite we see where the great Roman hierarchy and them are go to meet now they're going to change some programs I thought they didn't change but they're going to anyhow give each priest the power of a pope and and wherever he's at and so forth how pitiful that the church ever sold out to dogmas instead of the word see that's where they left the key right there that's the reason the great Miracles and signs are not done amongst the people today that there used to be they have l lost the key God they know the door they know the door is there but the next thing is the key the open the door the treasures is behind the door they're locked up out of sight from the unbeliever but the believer who has faith and can take the key of faith can unlock these doors yes sir one time here a few years ago there's a missionary brother and he felt he had a call to Africa he was a young fell a wife and two children very pretty young girls about 78 years old a piece and this young fell couldn't get away from it he was a a minister he had a nice church and the country but he just couldn't get away from that call he must go to Africa and he prayed day and night he didn't want to go and God kept speaking to him you must go and finally come to a place to leave a showdown where he he must go so he went to the mission Board of his church and he said God has called me to Mission Fields way back in the jungles of of rodesia and in this jungle it's invested with malaria with uh fever and with that hot sun and plager and leprosy all kinds of diseases back in this jungle the where he was going to make take the rest of his life sold his home and all he had so the mission board wanted a testing and they said are you sure now he said I am positive they said to him sir have you thought it on this manner that you got two pretty little girls and you got a a lovely young wife and if you're just why don't you just go over and see how it is and then come back he said no the Lord told me oh it's so real he said the Lord call me and I I don't want to leave my home I don't want to leave my church and my people but the Lord called me back there in that jungle and he said sir did you know your little girls could take yala fever a black water fever and die overnight and he referred to different people that had lost their children the little fellas to take them back in their own diseases that they had no inoculation for and said think of leprosy of your pretty wife and your two little girls with Leprosy and that hot sun and things you've got the up with said aren't you afraid and the danger of taking your children and wife in such a place and the missionaries stood there the young fellow and the tears began to run down his cheeks he turned around and said my brethren my vision of God's call he said if God has called me to Africa my children and families more safer in Africa than any place in the world Amen hallelujah amen what was it he had the key to his call he had faith in what he was talking about amen Oh I thought what a gallot remark Hallelujah when I first heard that my heart bounced see if God has called me to Africa my children in the leprosy and plager and everything else they safer there than any other place on the face of the Earth amen he had the key that's what it takes when you got the key there's no fear there's no doubt there's no question you don't have to ask anybody else about it you know exactly you've got it in your hands you know what to do amen hallelujah you know what the score is you know the doors go to unlock you check the levers and you know it's strictly the right thing amen doors going to flow when you throw the key in it oh [Music]
