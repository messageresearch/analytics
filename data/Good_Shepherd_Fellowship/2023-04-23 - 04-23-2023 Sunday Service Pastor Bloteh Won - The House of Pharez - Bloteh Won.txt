this morning as we just want to look into the word of the Lord thank you musicians we will we will that would be all for the music I had a song I wanted to sing but uh I'm more burdened with what I want to preach this morning than my song Amen so maybe we will do singing after the service or after the preaching of the word will bring praise to be able to walk uh water the word down or uh what are the seed of the word you know last Sunday after the service uh I went with uh with the brother that preached for us brother William we want to visit a family as a family friend of Haitian we grew up together so he thought that he would be able to see a young man before he leave and now and we went and uh drove him there then we visited with the family and uh and while we were there uh the turnout that uh the the family a lovely family and one of the the little boy uh in the house little boy he's dealing with autism and uh while we were there visiting we had a good time you know we had a good time and talking but there was just something that kind of her uh struck me a little bit okay young people you have your meeting after after service uh today so uh if we don't forgive we announce it when we come to the end of the service and so uh but then there was something that kind of caught my attention a little bit and what actually it was was the other I think uh sometimes all through the week I was thinking about it and it's actually brought me to a place where uh I was standing on the subject to preach and uh and I really found find the China to be able to enter in it and what actually it was is that I've been thinking about dealing with shame speaking on dealing with shame that's not what I'm going to speak on this morning but uh that was what was on my mind was from what I saw and uh many times uh when we have to deal with a loved one that is now well whether it's a child it's a house one is is a sibling or whatever it is that uh not so easy we don't come to term we're dealing with that so easily but as I was thinking about it and I I got to thinking also how uh even as a church we uh we uh we are blessed because we have a big group of uh of of some of the brothers and sisters here that work in uh in in some of the facilities group home and and nursing homes and and all of that and uh in as much as it is a blessing if we don't know how to deal with faith and how to uh identify is it is it is not just a job for a paycheck but I also believe that uh it's uh is is uh it's a place it's a place of calling where you know God can place a Son of God and a daughter of God for us to be blessing to those people praise the Lord ain't as much it's a job where the uh you know we go in and out but we have to realize we are dealing with people that are now well and uh and we and we want to be in the right mindset we want to be you know also prayerful you know uh uh and and many of the times uh we don't realize how much our present our presence is a blessing to those people you know when when you a Son of God the way you order your life you keep your life under the atmosphere of God's word you go to you go to work to go and help people you know uh uh have a good day in their homes or in their caregiving area is such a blessing and it's always good to be in the right mind amen for us to be in the right mindset and also in the right spirit because uh uh uh imagine in many ways people don't know how to deal with uh with shame praise the Lord many times is is there with by either hiding away from it you know uh or uh choosing a complete different personality praise the Lord they take a complete different personality because they just don't want to deal with that but I pray that the Lord will will be able to to give us Grace because you will realize Jesus said is only him that is nashik that don't need a physician praise the Lord if every one of us here this morning can say we need a great physician then we must all accept that we all have a special need s your special need might not be my special name praise the Lord I have a special need and I will ask that you pray for me my specialty one of my special needs I have a heading cross eye that many times I'm looking and I'm not even looking at you but it appears so bad that people think what in the world what is he looking at me like that and actually I'm not looking at you I might be facing your direction but my mind is completely somewhere else many times people have told me about that man you got an ugly look why are you looking like that and it's I mean truly my mind is gone I'm thinking about something yes I remember the first time I went to to the Ivory Coast many years back 1994. and then uh the uh I traveled down to abhijan and there was a there was a family there we were we were dead and uh uh actually this brother was working on the refugee camp and he left the the Saints there they didn't know where he was he was not coming back and I was moving in the area so I needed to talk to him so I went there and and we were visiting and then after after a month or so when when uh when uh when when his wife father family was settled down with us it was another brother myself you know settled down with us then she called me she said she says son let me confess to you he said you know I don't know I I don't think it was you I think it was me because I will always think am I dressing wrong why is he looking at me like that and then I would go out look at myself in the mirror I said there was nothing wrong with me and definitely I was thinking about the church I left in a wall area I was worried what is going on with those people and yeah this woman thinking that I'm I'm criticizing her with so that's my special need I have a terrible cross eye so the day you find me looking at you and you are not okay with it just say that his eyes is crossed but we we all have a special name praise the Lord and you see and and and and and and some of these Special Needs there are some that we are not proud of there are some that we don't want anybody to know of but we know it's a need we know it's a need praise the Lord now realizing that we all have a special need it create this room of comfort for us to be able to accommodate others that have special needs not only for money but to realize that from the day our parents Aaron and Eve fare from Grace he put the word to the place word out of their children that we are a bone with special needs for the fact that we are born in this world coming to the word speaking lies we all have a special need if God bless us we will preach that message on a special need a brother uh uh I brought a little concern to me now from uh from the the speaker last week and just like I said Wednesday night you know uh we appreciate our brother Ariel uh you know translating for us and which of course I thought that was that was beautiful there were some there were some things a line of thoughts that the brother expressed one of them he was talking about uh he was coming with the top the other uh it is not because we uh we are in a message that we are the bride so he expressed the thought there there are foolish virgin here okay he said that you know they are foolish virgin here man so it is all it is coming from the top it is not from the top because we know that the message is sent to call other people for his namesake and the people for his name said is the bride praise the Lord so the purpose of the message is to call out a brine praise the Lord amen but when the preacher expressed things that way it is it is we cannot we cannot commentate that in a sense that we know that in every Gathering they have three kinds of people and the three kinds of people is not the bride right is now all of them debride are we together amen so sometimes when the preacher expressed that he's not saying there is foolish virgin in the message all there is foolish virgin in the bride you you cannot mix those two the bride cannot be a foolish virgin there is wise virgin which is the bride and there is fully virgin yes praise the Lord amen so uh uh those kind of a statement I would take them in that light you know I would take them in their life that he's uh trying to uh encourage us to to just like the scripture we say come up higher praise the Lord amen and he was also talking about how the blood speaks you know we're speaking about how the blood speaks and he says the blood of Abel was speaking for virgins he was crying out the blood cried the Bible says the blood of ABIA crowd against the blood I mean against King and and then he talks about how the blood of Jesus Christ speak for forgiveness and now in breaking his his uh his illustration to show us how the blood speaks he took he took America comparison that a man want to marry and he's of this blood type and the woman want to marry of this blood type that is not a doctrine that we believe okay is now the doctrine that we believe I don't believe it why because if we have a blood that speak better things if the blood of Jesus Christ speak better things praise the Lord then for us to come to the place where we would take in consideration our human blood for the examination before we can take somebody into the grace of God then we are trumping the blood of Jesus Christ lesser than our human blood so to me he an example praise the Lord he was not establishing a Doctrine it's two different things praise the Lord okay with that being said if there is more conversation we can talk about it later less than on our feet we'll turn to the Book of Ruth praise the Lord and uh you love the Lord brother brother last Lady insists of Vicky we are we are home folks here we have a habit that when we come here we start talking about the word of God we just get lost about time and and it seems like we stayed so long I will want to apologize to you before I start will you please be patient with me praise the Lord Ruth chapter four let's read in the in the Bible yeah root chapter 4. amen praise the Lord I mean it's a blessing to have them to take up a time and come and visit with us praise the Lord Ruth chapter four now when you look in the Book of Ruth chapter four there is there is a there is a line of Prophecy that is lying in that and uh uh we just came through Easter and uh and a brother uh Mark Howard was preaching for us and he was talking about Redemption and all of there the book of a rule having one of the most beautiful and profound Redemptive storage I won't keep you long because we can I can I can run through this thing and then uh if the Lord bless it you might lose your appetite for food and just you know stay right here the whole day praise the Lord [Music] but let's read verse 12. I will have you to sit down and we will go back to the to to chapter verse one let's read verse 12. of Ruth chapter four verse 11 will be good to read and all the people that were at the gate this was at the wedding of Boaz and Ruth all the people are the gate and the others said we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman that is come into the house like Rachel and like live praise the Lord which two did built the house of Israel and do thou worthily in Africa and be famous in Bethlehem praise the Lord and let the house be like the house of fears whom tear my bed unto Judah of the seed which the Lord shall I give thee of this young woman of the sea which the Lord shall give thee that sounds to me like genesis chapter 3 15 the seed of the woman of the sea which the Lord shall give thee praise the Lord of this young woman the Lord bless you you may have your seed we just did a reading year and I want to I want to I want to speak this morning on the house of pharaohs it's a prophecy it's a prophecy and I'm and I'm I'm trusting that the Lord will be able to to help us to be able to look into it uh this morning by the help of the Lord amen let's go back to verse one like I said we will try to read quickly when boys then went up to the gate and shut down boy sat down and behold the King's Men whom bought us uh of humble aspect came by unto whom he said oh such a one turn the sound sit down and he turned us out and he sit down and he sat down sorry and he took 10 men of the others of the city and said said yes sit year down year and they sat down now there is there is two places in the scripture where you where you see this there is another place but you don't you don't see it until you look for it and uh uh of the praise the Lord the other place where you will see this is actually over in the bulk of uh Genesis you will find that over in the Book of Genesis but let me let me give you the picture of what it is here this is uh is uh it's a tradition it was a tradition in the land of Israel the other uh whenever you have a a wedding ceremony like this you have 10 others and uh uh and and these 10 men will be there like witness so if you actually go back to the Book of Genesis which of course I would not want us to go back there I think I I spoke on that before you found out that even in Genesis chapter 24 the bible really never call out the name of of Abraham 7. we call him elieza and the reason why we call him Eleazar is because of Genesis chapter 15. but if you read Genesis chapter 24 his name is not mentioned why his name is not mentioned is because his honor a Divine commission he's acting like the Holy Spirit he's going out to search out a bride for the father praise the Lord so all of that mentioned he is the main character but if you if you follow the story and closely when you read you will realize that elieza went with camels that Rebecca gave those candles to drink praise the Lord but as you read the story from the beginning and and in a way that we have read it it always looked like it was Eli Isa a loan that was on that mission no read Genesis chapter 24 when you get whom you realize a win with men and as a Jewish custom that's what that you cannot have a proper Jewish wedding without the elders witnessing you have to have an end this this uh there's uh there's a Jewish name for it let me let me find it for you I have a year in one of my notes I was just speaking on that uh some time ago let me go to what I want to speak in and that's that's where I lost a lot of time but if if you read a scripture you would then you understand and and and and and and and also you see that's the reason why Broadband there in the in church age book he says I'm placing you to the same place he says I'm placing you ministers to the same place where I am you are also messenger of this message praise the Lord because God knew that there will be a faithful fight for Ministry that will come behind and being able to live the voice of Elijah before the people right right are we together now so that is the place of these 10 men let's go right there into the prophecy as we will go ahead and uh uh then the Bible goes here verse 3 and he said unto the king's man now Boaz is speaking to the man that was more closer to Naomi than him because there was a man that was more closer to Naomi than boys praise the Lord amen so Boaz is speaking now to that man he's saying uh into the kingsman now me that is come again out of the land of more of land which is of our brother amalek and he taught to advise these saying buy it before they inhabit things and before the errors of my people if thou will redeem it redeem it but if there will not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I am after thee so he was next in line and he said I will redeem it the guy said he's going to redeem it praise the Lord amen damn boa says obey thou borrow the field of the hand of Naomi thou must buy it also of Ruth the moabite so you see this guy was a businessman he was not really a soul Seeker he wanted a field but he he never he was not uh he didn't care and never had no concern for what would become of now mean or her daughter-in-law Ruth as soon as Boba says if you buy the field you have to buy it of the hand of Naomi and also of of Ruth the more about he back up praise the Lord amen the kingsman said I cannot redeem it for myself least and my my own inheritance redeemed thou my right told thyself for I cannot redeem it now this was the man and informal time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plug off his shoes and give it to his neighbor so the tradition was if you cannot redeem it you have to take off your shoes for your neighbor to step in it so you see when God came down and told Moses take off your shoes it was a Redemption language when he told Joshua take off your shoes it was a Redemption language and you and myself we have the same language when you tell somebody you are not in my shoes you are not you don't know what I'm going through because you are not in my shoes but I'm here to tell you this morning there is one that can fit every size I don't care what is your size what is your shoes whatever you're going to going through he can step in it it will be a neat fate praise the Lord are we together now this was the manner in uh in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing to confirm all things a man flock of his shoes and give it to his neighbor and this was a testimony in Israel praise the Lord Hallelujah therefore the king's man said untoboard by eight of the so he drew off his shoes praise the Lord are we together and boy said on to the others and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day bought all that was emulate and all that was chelon and melon of the hang of Naomi moreover Ruth the mobile the wife of male on her purchased to be my wife to raise up a name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead being there cut off from M1 his brethroughs and from the Gate of his place yeah our Witnesses this day and the people says we are all Witnesses amen and because you have done this the Lord make the woman that has come into the house like Rachel and Leah now think about it this is a moabite why are these people prophesying that she should be why they are saying they are saying they are let her be our mother because they are saying she should be like Rachel and Mia the mother of Israel the mother of the Patriot so we see there is something that is running very deep in this amen praise the Lord and also they said they never stop to Rachel and live they said and left the house be like the house of pharaohs now we have to find out this house of fears what is it all about are we together amen now now to take a lot of your time pharaohs was one of the twins that was born onto Judah by an abominable art that he had with his daughter in law Genesis chapter 38. where Tema was not giving unto Judah younger son she disguised herself praise the Lord praise the Lord amen are you ready to get your hands Daddy are you ready praise the Lord when Judah when I gave his daughter-in-law to I mean his his younger son to his daughter-in-law tema she disguised herself because she wanted to she wanted the blessing she disguised herself and Judah took her to be a prostitute and he hired her for a wife and she got pregnant and she got these two boys and at the birth of these two boys praise the Lord are we together of the birth of these two boys the Bible says when the first which was Zera he held his hands out and the male wife pulled a red ribbon around his his hand but then fear us overcame him and became the first to be born praise the Lord amen I was I will I will say it again so you grab my thought at a time of birth thereof was the child that was suspected to be birthed first and the male wife was trying to get Tema in the in the right condition for her to bring forth her boys there are hands came out and uh and the male wife put a red ribbing around his hand praise the Lord trying to position him for birth pharaohs broke forth so the name him Pharaoh's meaning you brought forth amends you overcame praise the Lord are we together glory be to God amen Genesis chapter 38 verse 29 the Bible says and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that was Era behold his brother came out and she said how have that broken forth this bridge be upon thee therefore his name was called parents praise the Lord he broke forth he overcame now here is it now that the the women the others of Israel is telling boss and his wife that left your house be the house be like the house of pharaohs are we together let's let's read Deuteronomy chapter 22 23. Deuteronomy chapter 23. praise the Lord I'm just going to lay the foundation here because there is just so much here for us to enjoy this morning amen do you have an appetite for the word praise the Lord or you just want me to get get it from here so you can go about and enjoy your day don't worry Deuteronomy chapter 23 verse 2. the Bible says a bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even though his 10th Generation enter into the congregation of the Lord an ammonite or a more bite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even unto their 10th Generation shall they not enter so they were also classified as bastard now you see that that word which means an illegitimate charge that word in our language today is normally used in a sense when a child don't know their father but that's that's not the right meaning the word is actually used when uh when a child is born uh out of holy warlock right praise the Lord okay which means because uh you cannot tell me pharaohs knew that Jacob was his father and the more but I knew that their their their parents were from from lot praise the Lord okay so it is always used when uh because there was there was there was uh uh uh a proper approach to to marriage and all of that so when when that was not done in the Jewish uh uh sense that's how they look at that when the child was you know was uh I would imagine not married a woman you know a child that was born out of uh what whatever so that's that's the I just I just want to I just want to uh uh uh you will realize that uh the the Pharisees they they they call Jesus illegitimate because Mary and Joseph were not married yet even though they were exposed to be married they were espoused to be married but they were now married here for the fact that she's now saying she's pregnant and the wedding was not done praise the Lord even though they said Joseph is his father so in a sense Joseph slept with his wife before the wedding day so in that sense they would call the child illegitimate praise the Lord are we together now but yeah we we see a prophecy that is standing like a strong commitment of the law of the bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord until the 10th Generation let's get back to the Book of Ruth let's discover that quickly because it's beautiful it is beautiful amen amen you love the Lord he's being so good to us the Lord being so good to us the Bible said well second to be prophesying to this man promising him there he says how should be like the house of richer and and and Leah the mother of Israel and also let his house be like the house of pharaohs see the kind of for other they are referring to but let's see why why they say that the Bible says verse 13 so boas took Ruth and she was his wife and he went on to her and the lord gave her conception and she beared a son and the women said unto Naomi and blessed be the Lord which have not left it this day without a casement that his name may be famous in Israel and he shall be unto thee he shall be the king's man shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life the King's Men shall be unto thee the nourisher of thine o h and Thy daughter-in-lawed Thy famous daughter-in-law Ruth the Bible says which loveth thee which is n't Church to be then seven sons praise the Lord amen now you think about it and you'll think about it this is a very very uh be prophecy you mean roof there's more body that has been redeemed this thing it's now going to stand in Israel better than seven sons what kind of a language is that praise the Lord why because the songs were the one in the law to take the inheritance of their father inheritance was only given to the daughters when the daughters of zephas two before Moses and said our father don't have no boy and we don't want his name to lie dead in Israel give us the inheritance of our father praise the Lord amen amen so now Moses have to write another Lord that if if a family don't have a boy then now The Inheritance can be given to the girl but she has to marry in that tribe so the inheritance can stay in the tribe are we together but Jerry said now these people that know the Commandment of Moses they are saying here that rules this more abide are being redeemed she's better seven sons do you see how in God's Redemption plan how he thinks about his bride he lived the bride higher than the messenger praise the Lord in God's mind he esteemed the people that have been called out by the message more than the messenger oh when it's becoming sweet it becomes selling I love it glory be to God that is better than seven [Applause] there was a bride that was called out right every age had a bride that was caught out praise the Lord the bride she is the reproduction of the message the message that was preached produces a people right praise the Lord amen that is the benefit of the messenger message yes we are trophic of his right around him saying you are the crowning of my message praise the Lord she's better than seven sons that's not what I'm preaching on this morning [Music] glory be to God and now men took the child and it was in habuzum and she began to nurse it praise the Lord and the women her neighbors gave it a name saying there is a sun bone to now me and they call his name Obed he is the father of Jesse the father of David then the Bible says this now comes down here from verse 18 to verse 22. if you look at from Verse 18 to verse 22 the Bible says these are the generation of pharaohs now you have to know that uh uh he's the son of Judah now so if you read from Verse 18 to verse 22 you will count 10th Generation praise the Lord amen you are going to count ten generation praise the Lord amen now grab this now grab this I want you to I want you to to to to to to to to put on your your spiritual glasses the Bible Ruth this is Ruth and Boaz that just got married okay a song is born unto them the song named is Obed are we together ask yourself a question why did the Holy Spirit you give us their genology of pharaohs what important and and and the Holy Spirit will give us the generation of pharaohs and it will end on David [Music] and when you come from pharaohs to David it's 10th Generations what is the important we're not talking about Tema here we're talking about Ruth but to show that when the the women of Israel said that when the others if this was not a women this was the address that said let your house be the house of pharaoh [Music] because of that prophecy this genealogy was important are we together amen I told you you have to get ready to get your hands dirty let's look at Deuteronomy chapter 17. um very soon we'll realize that we are out of the house of pharaohs praise the Lord the fear of the House of pharaohs have to deal with the the the uh our natural birth and the Mystery behind our natural birth praise the Lord the reason why God's grace could reach you that's part of the family you were born that's part of the tribe you were born the country whatever wherever you were born but God's grace could reach down to you is because you were from the praise the Lord we are getting on ancestor.com amen we are checking our family tree glory be to God amen let's read something here that is very interesting Deuteronomy chapter 17 verse 14. you you will find a couple of them there in the Books of Moses but this one is is is is is uh is very interesting let's read verse 14 here when thou I come unto the land which the Lord that God gave verse 14 and shall possess it and shall dwell therein and shall I say I will set a king over me like us all the nation that are about me now this is before the went to the promised land this is before Samuel was born so are you telling me that God knew that these people would desire a king are you telling me that God had in his mind that they would have a cake yes because when Judah was blessed Jacob said the scepter shall be in Judah he was speaking about a king yes that a king would come out of Judah yes [Music] when you get to the land and you finally get to the place and say we want a king praise the Lord look said I will say it again you cannot impress God right you can impress him he knows your next step he knows your next step whatever plan we have whatever your plan is is Plan B whatever your plan is play eight father's hands oh I love it praise the Lord all your reasons we read Samuel we all read Samuel and we think that people rejected the king but their God is telling her you will you will desire a king you will come to the place where you will want to be like the rest of the nation but let me tell you when you get to that place together you see when brother Brandon preached they reject your king go back and study the message what did I say steady go back and study it when brother Branham preached the rejected King what the prophet was preaching bringing to us is that it is the rejection of the leadership of the Holy Spirit that reject amen of the Holy Spirit oh I can't read the quotes to you because I honored lightning yesterday I was just listening to him even this morning on my way to church when you get to the place and say I will set a king or I mean like us all all the nations around about me thou shy in any way set him a king over thee whom the Lord thy God has chosen so what is God is saying here when you get to that place go back to the word of God go back you must go to the one that the Lord has chosen where God said there will come a king if Israel was smart in a time of Samir praise the Lord oh I shared that with you before because when Samuel met a song what did he say am I not a Vegemite right why because he knew the promise was from Judah not from Benjamin right so even he himself knew something is wrong with this right because God is saying here the day you desire a king go to where is choosing that your king would come from praise the Lord yeah man yeah yeah yeah yeah said the king over thee whom the Lord thy God has choose one from among thy bredments shot thou sets King over me thou may have Matt said a stranger over thee which is not thy Brothers but he shall not multiply in Hershey's to himself now you can read the rest down that's why I just wanted to get that part for you go home read the rest down and you will realize that everything that God says here fulfill in the life of Solomon he had more horses he had more wives he have more everything there [Music] almighty God was telling Israel their future what am I preaching this morning praise the Lord amen God how to Kink that's the reason why David was a king after God's heart he was a man after God's heart that that statement is prophetic that's the reason why the millennial Throne is promised to the son of David is called the son of David praise the Lord because he's the 10th he's the 10th after Judah Pharos became the first and David is the tenth glory be to God are we together Matthew chapter two I've not even started preaching yeah I just reading my scripture but don't worry don't worry don't worry we can have more time to continue this amen I can preach this for the rest of the year amen Matthew chapter one sorry Matthew chapter one Matthew chapter one sorry I said I said chapter two in my Lord verse chapter one verse there's one the Bible says and and uh the bulk of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham let us let us put on our thinking camp David and Abraham who was before themselves who was before the other who was before the other what are you you're behaving as if to say you are afraid Abraham was before David why will Matthew Paul the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham why he did that praise the Lord why because like brother Branham said the the the the full anointing that wrote the book of of of the gospels Matthew was all of the anointing of a kinship Matthew is the only one that recorded the wise man saying where is he born King of the Jews Matthew was the only one that recorded that why because his approach told the witness of Jesus Christ was going to be all about the kinship when it is fake Abraham comes before David because it is the Faith of Our Father Abraham but when his kinship then it comes before Abraham foreign oh man praise the Lord I love the word of God amen he did not make mistakes no it was not a mistake it was the design by the Holy Spirit so when your ego I see it you can say wait something gone wrong here right right why is David before Abraham is that uh a writer's mistake no is not a righteous mistake it's a design the Holy Ghost designed it that way to be able to grab the eyes of the inlet praise the Lord was Major on the kingdom of heaven because when you have a king you have a kingdom are we together now so we we are talking about the house for us the house that Break Forth a house that overcome praise the Lord amen let's read one more verse then I can stop preaching first John chapter 2. just one more verse then you can just just let me lose thank you oh my God what a wonderful Jesus we sell yeah amen we owe him our life we owe him everything praise the Lord that's the reason why they must it must be a joyful thing for us to be in the house of the Lord we must be like David I was glad when he said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord praise the Lord because here I can yet I can hear my true story praise the Lord I can find my family tree here in this house of the Lord praise the Lord I can hear the things that the media would not tell me right I can hear almighty God speaking to me I was glad when he said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord first John chapter 2. you love the Lord this morning amen praise the Lord first John chapter 2 that's what I said verse 12. John returning back from the island of Patmos mm-hmm John returning back from the island of patma sorry I'm I'm completely in a different book I'm wondering what did I write down here returning back from the island of Patmos and all of the things that he saw there he's he's uh he's bringing us into into the reality of that he says um I write unto you my little children because your sin are forgiving I forgiving you for his namesake I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning Amen in the beginning was the word that's right a responsibilities to parents to know the word right know him that is from the beginning it's not the church that was from the beginning from the beginning right unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because ye have overcome the weaker one I write unto you little ones because ye have known the father I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men young people because ye are strong and the word of God abareth in you and ye have overcome not you will no no yeah sir praise the Lord amen amen not that you will yeah praise the Lord amen amen not that you will ye have glory be to God Amen now so you see John yeah after coming back from the island of Patmos the things that was revealed to him the things that he saw looking into the future Revelation chapter 1 the Bible says this was about Jesus and the future ages of his church and those things that were revealed unto John he saw our day he saw this day that we are living in he saw all the violence you read a a Revelation chapter 9 all those horrible images that John was describing is the spirit that is doing all the murder and riffs that we have in the nation today it's no spirit that John was destroyed in Revelation chapter nine those creatures with head hanging down like women it's the demons that are that are creating all the murder making the word and unsafe place praise the Lord he saw our day he saw the evil that is upon the world today all of those spirits that are now breeding and haunting the words breathing over the word with Russia and China creating our lands and Iran and all of that praise the Lord brother Brown says the demons he says it's demon spirits he says the harbor all of the land and and and and create all of these wars powers to bring destruction upon the people yes you know when he came back out of that vision came back to the church of Ephesus he said young people praise the Lord amen he said I write unto you because you are strong right praise the Lord you might not look like you are strong right but you are strong yes glory be to God Amen because your parents never had to deal with the kind of foreign praise the Lord they have their struggle for the age by your age of virtual reality praise the Lord your age of dealing with demon evil spirit through the fourth dimension right that can engage you you get into a video games and engage you just like it's a person praise the Lord Charles say you are strong I'm seeing the C Incorruptible in you that ain't a mess of all of that you will come of us Overcomers because you were born in the house of pharaohs he breaks forth he overcame Hallelujah you see the scripture gave us all of that Foundation to make us to realize that there is nothing of our natural birth that will make us an overcomer right right because if we Trace all of our natural births we will all be born yes if we Trace all of our natural birth praise the Lord because David said a sin did my mother conceived me praise the Lord which one of us here never came that way if there is one year Hallelujah but Ram says here believe they are this he says but Jesus when he was born he was born with that Mark of being illegitimate giving our lord Jesus he was born without mark praise the Lord even though his mother was a virgin yeah praise the Lord but the birth was mysterious the Medical Science could not make sense of it right the religious people cannot find a place in the world right right Hallelujah he was born without mind of being illegitimate that his father was Joseph and that that he was born in all the word Ambassador child born by a father uh uh by a mother he was conceived before that they were married praise the Lord and I will say that's wrong because God was his father he was born at virgin birth praise the Lord God produced the blood cells God produced the exhale but you see that the system of that word put a mark on him why because they couldn't understand it they couldn't understand it now if Joseph and Mary was married nobody will know no matter where even believe Mary testimony that and angel visited her right right praise the Lord are we together now you see so you see almighty God in his mind just like God prophesying to Israel seeing their future and seeing that they will come to a place where they will say we want to be like other nations he said when you finally get to that place remember I told you that the sector will come out of Judah right right if you have anything less than that you will be out of my will right if you have a king do not want to apply in hearses why because God always wanted for his people to rely on him for strength for their battle that's right praise the Lord are we together for him we're out of seven says here he says and I believe that every Christian that's born again has has to go to those has to go to those tests every song that cometh to God must be first chest in Parts amen is that right if you cannot stand chasmine of the Lord then you become a bastard now so see where the word of God is putting the poor John we're seeing here in in and tell John that we are born of the sea Incorruptible which is the word of God so you see is that birth by the word of God that God called the origin of birth praise the Lord is that birth your new birth praise the Lord your new birth it brings you back to your original nature it brings you back to where the father wants you to be praise the Lord we love our parents we love our tribe we love our community our family praise the Lord so you see God designing for us to be able to understand it and appreciate it how we will come from an abominable birth just like Judah and tema and we will travel praise the Lord we because if you read Matthew Chapter 2 you read the entire genology it's a it's a generation of Jesus Christ is mentioned in that generation Ruth is mentioned in that generation praise the Lord even belsheba yeah even though Sheba praise the Lord there are no matter what how horrible your family background might be right praise the Lord a king can be born in the manger of your heart praise the Lord no matter how horrible you are bringing might be there is something in you Break Forth praise the Lord amen amen there is something in you that can count for like fear us break out of all the odds now sit down and cry it's in you praise the Lord God blessed in you and until we come to that place come to the realization like The Prodigal Son until we wake up and come to the realization that is in you amen praise the Lord the father never wrote a letter and sent it to his son and said son is okay come back home now no it was in him when he woke up and he got to the place and said I'm tired I'm tired of this false identity let's go back to my father's house it was in him it's a seed of a sonship is in you praise the Lord you can sit down and and complain love for who to blame for your problem oh how the devil love that how he love it and he will come right behind you and say that's true they are so mean they call the accept message believer they are so mean they don't even care um Hallelujah [Music] Sapp and see brother bear and said we went back in the tournament and show and show that an illegitimate bastard could not even enter the congregation of the law of 14th generation that was honor the Lord and Christ come to magnify the Lord he said how much more now and what's happening to this what's the matter with all these flipper now Robert Brown is trying to show in this scripture is there the uh uh if honor the law the law lay it out and we're seeing all of these things that are happening on the Earth I mean just just how man heart is becoming cruel right praise the Lord is becoming Quran it was a very common thing for the person to stand by the uh the side of the road and hack a vehicle and any lovely person will stop their card and say come on in I'll drop you to the next stop it's not common anymore it's not common anymore because people have experienced carjacks right praise the Lord it was a common thing to run to the neighbor house and say help me help me is no longer common it's not common anymore because they never don't know if you're coming to wrap them praise the Lord so that's why he's talking about here how much more how much more with all of these things coming upon the Earth how far there's a generation getting away from the presence of the Lord [Music] how far away Bible verses used to be a thing that was very common for the little ones in church they rather know all the NBA stars and all the rappers name and they cannot even quote one Bible verse that's how far the generation is getting away from the house of the Lord yeah yeah getting away from the congregation of the Lord it's not how smart and how cool we dress them to be in church where is your heart where is the heart of these young ones yeah the word of God is trying to show our journey trying to show our journey praise the Lord I know there is no horrible thing that you can go through whether you are creating it for yourself or whether you are actually going through it there will stay a way out praise the Lord amen am I honest too yes yes amen there is no horrible thing whether you are creating it for yourself oh you are actually going through it it's a way out and praise the Lord because there will always be in the house of pharaohs there will always be a house that will overcome there will always be a house that will rise above the struggle rise above the failures praise the Lord I'm here to tell you this morning that you can be a better boy you can be a better girl praise the Lord amen we can be better husbands to our wives to our husbands right we can be better Sons and Daughters of God in the house of God and in the service of the Lord praise the Lord it does not come by joining the church it comes from a birth I'll tell you how thy birth you will hang on as long as you can hang on right if you don't have that birth you will let go yes yes praise the Lord [Music] that's God's love for you and myself you see when God look at that law when he looked at the law of an illegitimately try like brother Brandon was saying he says yeah I was reading one quote there he says this does not sound like a nice word so let's say an illegitimate child he said the Bible there in the Bible they call it a Rasta child he said it does not sound like a nice word but let's call it an idiot if you look at God's law praise the Lord God was not even he was not aiming at a vulnerable woman that could not help herself praise the Lord and then she ever get him pregnant by a useless man God will be cruel what did that child did but you see the law of God goes back to the beginning God was addressing the best that took place in eating praise the Lord Hallelujah [Music] that's the reason why the word of God could pick up a woman that will come to the feet of Jesus weeping that's the reason why he could go by the Sumerian well and still give hope to a woman that have six men in her life praise the Lord if we are realize Jews are Gentiles we are all born from the house of perish no matter how how many laws they keep they all came from the house of pharaohs praise the Lord what am I trying to do this morning this afternoon time I should let you go what am I trying to do see because when we can never get to the place to appreciate the grace of God that has come to us yes amen if we can never get to that place oh man I wrote something down someone said it's the difference between privilege and entitlement is gratefulness it's gratefulness many many of us thinks that we are entitled right I'm born in a message you are never there is nobody that is born in this message is the other way around the message must be born in you praise the Lord you were born in Saint John or Saint Mary Hospital you are now born in the message praise the Lord and because of that mentality we think that we are entitled yes now people should save us is gratefulness yes when you start being grateful you are making a lot of room to be protected if you stop being grateful you are allowing the Holy Ghost to come your way you say Lord I don't deserve it I don't deserve this when I see what other young people are going through and you've been so merciful to me you stop being grateful yourself but when you think that you are a privileged child yeah oh you are entitled thank you praise the Lord this word is the origin of see I read this and then we close musicians you can come just like I said Wednesday night I want you to get any kind of a misconception that uh uh trying to fuss against you if you think so meet me in the office we settle our differences praise the Lord amen when you see that was the thing that broke my heart last Sunday we were there and I was I was seeing how this young man was trying to struggle to keep his son away Maybe not for the visitors not to know that he have a special needs son it broke my spirit and my mind starts to go back and I start to think how the people sit in church with special needs they have a special needs in their life but because they think they are entitled or they are a privileged child nobody can talk to me this way nobody must say this to me and you know what special need brings it brings a sin it brings a sense of Shame and all through the wig are just going I was just thinking I said Lord how many times we do the same how many times we do the same you see the early church was not like that the Bible says they went from house to house breaking bread right and many of the time the things that we do the Bible says those people that were into witchcraft they brought their books destroy them and the apostles feet whenever they had a special need they reigned to the house of God and said Bradleys this is my situation that was all the early church was did they not have their need of God in their life try to put up that kind of a religious spirits right one of them tried to do it as chapter 16. a young lady started growing this man I'm the man of God this man a holy man this man a holy man Paul says this is not a right spirit you might be a privileged child but this is not the right spirit [Music] all right foreign [Music] but if we would just realize how much blessed that we are [Music] how much blessed that we are to have young people in our Church the message [Music] in the midst of all of your struggle they still love God [Music] you go to other societies and other communities you realize foreign this generation of young people the way they view the church [Music] the things that I try to do to get away shot away from the church [Music] if we as a church as a group of people that comes to this place Wednesday night and Sunday morning I call this place home church and and and support it with your Finance your tithes and your offering just realize [Music] how much more God can do for us praise the Lord [Music] how much more than the Holy Ghost want to do in your home in your life foreign how much reality and I was just reading that on one Wednesday night after the service step back he had a little baby I just had a good time because I mean there was just such a present year Wednesday night the beautiful presence and I went back to that scripture even the Sun that was in the house the one that thought that he never smoked he never drank he never did nothing wrong because of that he thought that he was entitled praise the Lord I think brother Jordan brought that up for us one time and I'll tell you that that was a beautiful message you never left my mind [Music] was his praise the Lord maybe he thought he was trying to impress the father well all he needed to do was just to wake up just to wake up [Music] I pray that the holy spirit will take these words and any sudden to your heart because he's the preacher you would go home and pick up the scripture that looked dead and God who starts to speak to you who starts to address your need in your life no matter what what our struggle is our struggled it's only a house of Harris it's a house of Judah our our struggle is a house of lot and his daughters but when God bring you forth as a Son of God or as a daughter of God we know when the grace of God wrap your heart and realize I can live better than this I can live better than it's in you to do it you don't need religion to put it in you it's in You by a predestinator see God has already placed in you it's in you to be better [Music] I stand to our feet Jesus has changed my home thank you [Music] sweet Jesus has changed foreign [Music] foreign [Music] every day who just realized no matter what trouble am I have we found my little child [Music] if we if you step out of the place of entitlement because entitlement sometimes put a Christian to the place where you think that because you are a Christian your child is better than all the other children thank you but if if gratefulness step in you will realize that you are grateful they are not the best but you are still grateful they are going through things they are dealing with things it might be your husband it might be your wife even children it might be your parents before that God has given you the parents that he has given you [Music] if we brothers would just be thankful for our wives if you just be thankful for your wives they are the mothers of your children they are mad what we want them to be the reason is because you don't make them because if you were born to be the one to make them you are going to make them the way you want them to be you never make them is where we express gratefulness to God if we will be grateful for the man that God put over us to be the head of the home he might not be the smartest one or the richest one praise the Lord just look at the house from the outside you don't know the things that is happening behind those walls but when you have a home where you can sit down [Music] your child might come in and slam the door but they're coming that's what is good they're coming even though they slam the door they're not supposed to slam the door but the father is that they have coming [Music] that's right praise the Lord I don't like the way my wife talked to me but it's good school she talking to you the good thing there is that she's talking to you praise the Lord because that's something that don't talk I don't like how my husband the good thing there is that he's dead foreign we will all just realized this morning now whatever your battle whatever your struggle is is in you to rise above it if you would tell yourself whenever you are dealing with a situation tell yourself I can do better I can do better [Music] Heavenly Father I've kept your children law father longer but God I just pray Lord father and your grace Lord will
