[36:28] our Lord and our savior Jesus
[36:35] indeed you are buying
[36:39] for we have not come this far
[36:42] based on our strength
[36:44] if it has to do with strength we have
[36:47] none
[36:49] we have not come this far based on our
[36:51] righteousness
[36:53] if it had to be by our righteousness we
[36:57] will not be here
[36:59] we have not come this far because we
[37:01] know how
[37:03] but one thing we do know
[37:06] is that our faith is in you
[37:10] thank you so very much dear Lord Jesus
[37:14] for having taken complete control
[37:16] over our lives

[40:35] we pray and we thank you sincere
[40:37] [Music]
[40:45] praise be to God Amen God bless you
[40:48] musicians
[40:49] I had a message I had to pass on okay
[40:52] I think they are here now and there was
[40:54] an accident on the way
[40:56] and brother Ben and his family couldn't
[40:58] get to come in early they were held up
[41:01] and I was supposed to have passed this
[41:03] to you guys before now but thank God
[41:06] uh better late than never
[41:09] so God bless you and are we all for now
[41:14] so why we are so standing
[41:17] if we can reach out
[41:22] for our Bibles
[41:26] and then turn to Psalms 78
[41:31] Psalms 78.
[41:44] Psalms 78 I'm reading from 38 to 42.
[42:06] but he
[42:10] being full of compassion
[42:13] talking about God
[42:16] forgive their iniquity
[42:18] and destroyed them not
[42:21] yeah
[42:23] many a Time
[42:26] turned he his anger away
[42:29] and did not stand up all his Wrath
[42:33] for he remembered that they were bad
[42:36] flesh
[42:38] a wind that passeth away
[42:41] and cometh not again
[42:44] how oft did they provoke him in the
[42:47] wilderness
[42:48] and grieve him
[42:50] in the desert
[42:52] yeah
[42:54] they turned back
[42:55] and tempted God
[42:58] and limited the Holy One of Israel
[43:02] they remembered not his hand
[43:04] nor the day when he delivered them from
[43:07] the enemy
[43:09] praise be to God
[43:11] may the Lord
[43:13] add His blessings to the region of his
[43:15] word shall we be seated
[43:22] we are all warmly welcome tonight
[43:28] I was wondering um today
[43:31] for a Wednesday night
[43:34] what we're going to talk about the last
[43:36] time I held us
[43:38] for
[43:41] a little too long
[43:44] and I'm hoping to manage my time tonight
[43:47] very well
[43:51] um I don't see us going Beyond 30
[43:52] minutes
[43:54] praise be to God Amen or maybe 45.
[43:58] amen
[44:02] praise the Lord
[44:05] but certainly something very small
[44:07] just to encourage ourselves
[44:10] praise be to God
[44:13] as I was getting ready I thought just
[44:16] came
[44:17] and not to go into
[44:20] the the specifics
[44:24] and I just wrote something down here
[44:26] whilst I was in the office
[44:29] that other days are getting closer
[44:32] let us bury
[44:35] our faces in the word of God
[44:40] for that is the only place we can find
[44:42] consolation
[44:44] that is the only place we can find
[44:46] strength
[44:49] and I believe by the grace of God that
[44:54] you can bury your face in the word of
[44:57] God so much so
[44:59] that when you get out there
[45:02] people can look at your face and they
[45:05] will see the glory of God
[45:07] amen
[45:09] I remember one time
[45:13] I don't know whether I was fasting and
[45:15] praying
[45:16] but I was actually waiting on the Lord
[45:20] and I stepped out
[45:23] the young man I met I knew him before
[45:26] and he knew me we were not meeting for
[45:29] the first time
[45:31] so when we met
[45:33] he just said little Jesus
[45:37] when he said it
[45:39] I had to turn around to see whether
[45:41] there was somebody behind me
[45:43] praise the Lord
[45:46] I didn't ask him anything
[45:49] I never told him about Christ
[45:51] I never witnessed to him
[45:54] nothing we never talked about anything
[45:56] religion
[45:58] but we will just meet hi hi hi hi and
[46:02] when he said that
[46:05] I kept wondering and from time to time
[46:08] that would come back again I was
[46:10] wondering what he saw
[46:14] you can bury your head in the word of
[46:17] God so much so
[46:19] that the word of God will take so much
[46:22] effect in your life
[46:25] that people will see you out there
[46:28] and they'll be looking at something
[46:30] that you are not even aware of
[46:39] if there was any time to wait on the
[46:42] Lord it is now
[46:44] I know we are all living in the U.S here
[46:46] we know what is happening everything
[46:48] that is going on that is just one side
[46:50] of the story but you know what
[46:53] be the child of God that you ought to be
[47:00] treat all men equal
[47:07] I know a lot of things happen
[47:11] I would be a hypocrite to say I do not
[47:13] know Industries in the community at work
[47:17] all around
[47:19] but treat all men equal
[47:24] be nice to everybody
[47:29] don't vent your spleen on somebody
[47:33] because they look like somebody who
[47:35] offended you
[47:42] in the Bible says so
[47:45] we should understand strangers
[47:48] for by so doing some have entertained
[47:51] angels on our way
[47:56] praise be to God
[47:59] I think I shared this story somewhere I
[48:01] don't know what it was here but what
[48:03] this happened in Ghana
[48:07] that's
[48:09] a total stranger a lady walked into
[48:12] somebody's compound
[48:15] and this woman drove her away
[48:18] like an animal
[48:21] and she came in asking for water to
[48:23] drink
[48:25] and the woman said I don't have cup for
[48:28] you in this house
[48:30] I didn't know how she was looking
[48:33] probably she was not well dressed
[48:36] maybe she didn't have that stature she
[48:38] was looking for
[48:40] and she just started blessing and
[48:42] insulting and drove her out of the house
[48:44] and then closed the gates
[48:47] so when she entered the house
[48:49] the children were asking her mommy
[48:52] what happened why why are you shouting
[48:54] and she says you know this mad woman
[48:57] she came here asking for water to drink
[49:00] so the children just ran open the door
[49:02] open the gates
[49:04] it was a compound house with a gate they
[49:07] opened the gate and then they looked
[49:09] left they didn't see anybody
[49:11] they looked right they didn't see
[49:13] anybody they said Mommy but there's
[49:16] nobody outside she should be there
[49:18] the mother came looked out there was
[49:21] nobody
[49:25] now a thought begins to set in who was
[49:28] this
[49:30] could I have done better
[49:32] and according to the story
[49:34] it was in the afternoon around 1 30.
[49:37] the same day before the sun set the
[49:41] woman caught stroke and she never got
[49:44] well till she died
[49:48] you don't know who is who
[49:51] even if you have the eyes to tell who an
[49:54] angel is
[49:55] if you have the eyes to tell who is who
[49:59] still be nice because everybody you are
[50:02] dealing with is a creation of God we are
[50:06] all creatures of God
[50:07] it is not your making that you are
[50:09] sitting here tonight
[50:11] it is the grace of God that has brought
[50:13] you in here tonight
[50:16] it is not because you are smart no
[50:19] it is not because we knew anybody no
[50:23] it's the grace of God
[50:26] just chose us because he loved us
[50:30] and we are here to show how much we
[50:34] appreciate God for what he has done for
[50:36] us
[50:39] if you see somebody
[50:41] and you haven't set in there on their
[50:43] way to hell
[50:44] and that they are perished
[50:47] still be merciful
[50:50] still be merciful
[50:52] because that could be you
[50:55] it could be you
[50:59] and sometimes
[51:01] as a matter of fact you look out there
[51:06] and the people you see
[51:10] who do not even believe in the Lord our
[51:12] God
[51:13] sometimes you look at them and you
[51:15] realize that some of them have more good
[51:19] morals
[51:20] than the children of God
[51:24] and it's not about good morals
[51:27] it's not about our strength what we can
[51:29] do and what we cannot do
[51:32] praise be together
[51:36] bury yourself in the world
[51:39] bury yourself in the world
[51:44] if you don't take anything from
[51:46] tonight's service let this be something
[51:50] that you walk away with tonight
[51:53] that you bury yourself in the word of
[51:56] God
[51:59] let the word of God be your uncle
[52:04] let the word be your friend
[52:08] let the word be your companion
[52:11] that you meditate upon the word by day
[52:14] and by night
[52:19] there is no dull moment
[52:21] in the life of a child of God
[52:25] every time
[52:26] whether in church or out of church
[52:30] you are just a sweet communion with God
[52:37] I can be on the job
[52:39] I don't care how strenuous it is I don't
[52:43] care how busy I am I don't care the
[52:46] pressure
[52:46] but every single moment there is this
[52:50] song Something In My Heart
[52:53] that just keeps going on and going on
[52:56] praise be to God
[52:59] it just keeps going on and on and on
[53:05] I know I am not a good singer
[53:08] but I believe if there was a humming
[53:10] competition I believe I'll be the first
[53:16] you wouldn't hear the harm what I'm
[53:18] having
[53:19] but I believe I'll be the first
[53:21] praise be to God
[53:24] yes
[53:26] tonight by the grace of God
[53:31] from the scripture we have read we are
[53:33] going to look at something
[53:37] when you read the very last portions of
[53:39] it
[53:42] I've been talking a little too much so
[53:45] it may have slipped away
[53:48] 78 I still have the Page open here
[53:52] 42
[53:54] they remembered not his hand
[53:57] no the death when he delivered them from
[53:59] the Enemy No so 41. yeah they turned
[54:05] back and tempted God and limited the
[54:08] Holy One of Israel praise be to God so I
[54:12] want to I want us to look at limiting
[54:15] God
[54:17] limiting God
[54:20] praise be to God
[54:22] to undermine God's Authority
[54:26] comes at a very great cost
[54:33] to ever undermine the authority of God
[54:39] remember
[54:40] and never forget
[54:42] Church
[54:44] never be in that position
[54:49] never come to a place
[54:52] I want to challenge our faith tonight
[54:57] I'm challenging our faith tonight
[55:00] to believe in Every Word of Promise
[55:04] to stand for the word of God
[55:07] whether rain or shine
[55:10] to depend on the turn on the word of God
[55:12] under every circumstance
[55:14] to seek the face of God in every
[55:17] situation
[55:21] have faith
[55:23] so much faith in the word of God
[55:26] and do not let the circumstances around
[55:29] your life the storms that the devil
[55:32] unleashes against you ever cause you to
[55:36] get to a place
[55:37] to undermine the authority of God
[55:44] Satan did it
[55:47] at the time he was Lucifer
[55:49] he never got away with it
[55:52] he never got
[55:56] never got there was no room
[55:58] for him for repentance
[56:01] and you wonder why
[56:03] the devil gets so angry
[56:06] when you have first chance Second Chance
[56:09] third chance fourth chance fifth chance
[56:13] and he never had even one to repent of
[56:21] praise be to God
[56:25] thank you
[56:31] now
[56:33] just to throw a little
[56:34] talk a little from the scripture we have
[56:36] just read and I'm going to start from
[56:38] the bottom up
[56:41] the scripture says
[56:50] for they remembered
[56:53] what did I say they remembered not
[56:57] 42 they remembered not his hand God
[57:01] bless you nor the day when he delivered
[57:03] them from the enemy they remembered not
[57:07] praise be to God
[57:11] now when you look
[57:14] the children of Israel
[57:17] we all know the story
[57:19] I'm just going to be jumping over and
[57:21] over
[57:22] because there's a place I want to get to
[57:24] here
[57:25] and as I said between 30-45 minutes
[57:27] which will bring in the curtain down
[57:29] that day were in bondage
[57:35] they cried out to God
[57:37] had their cry and God himself came down
[57:42] to deliver them
[57:44] in the land of Egypt they saw all that
[57:48] happened
[57:51] all the judgments that fell in Egypt
[57:55] when Pharaoh would not allow them to
[57:57] leave
[57:58] the place the locals the frogs turning
[58:02] Rivers into into blood all that they saw
[58:05] everything until the firstborn of every
[58:08] family had to die including animals they
[58:11] saw the hand of God and they knew God
[58:14] was in the camp
[58:16] it was not in doubt
[58:21] they saw how
[58:23] God delivered them from Egypt
[58:26] by the mighty hand of God
[58:29] and they saw
[58:31] how the angel of the Covenant was with
[58:33] them by day and by night in the pillar
[58:37] of God in the pillar of Fire
[58:40] they saw the hand of God how they went
[58:44] through the Red Sea they knew it was
[58:46] nothing but God praise be to God how the
[58:50] Christ how they got water from the rock
[58:52] I mean all the Miracles that happened in
[58:55] the wilderness
[58:57] and you wonder
[58:59] how on Earth
[59:01] with a man or a woman for that matter
[59:04] experience
[59:07] all this and still forget
[59:12] and still forget
[59:16] how can he how can a man or woman
[59:20] experience half of these things and
[59:23] still forget of the god
[59:26] who did it
[59:29] they remembered not
[59:31] they forget
[59:34] when God Called Moses
[59:36] Mountain
[59:38] the Bible says he was there for 40 days
[59:40] and 40 nights
[59:42] and at the foot of Hill was his Minister
[59:44] Joshua
[59:45] but in the camp
[59:47] the children of Israel were there
[59:49] and they waited and waited and waited
[59:52] and waited and Moses was not coming
[59:55] and they started
[59:57] Justin what's up what may have gone
[59:59] wrong
[1:00:00] oh God has abandoned us here
[1:00:03] Moses start coming back
[1:00:06] God has abandoned us Moses is not coming
[1:00:09] back
[1:00:11] excuse me
[1:00:22] we are not serving a god
[1:00:27] that will take you from point A
[1:00:30] and leave you in the middle of the road
[1:00:36] when he takes it to one point
[1:00:39] he is carrying you to a second point a
[1:00:42] definite point
[1:00:45] it doesn't matter what happens in
[1:00:47] between
[1:00:50] it doesn't change anything
[1:00:55] God is never going to turn his back on
[1:00:58] you in the middle of the journey
[1:01:02] God would never turn his back on you
[1:01:04] when he knows you need him the most
[1:01:08] he is never going to abandon you in the
[1:01:11] lurch
[1:01:12] when he knows that you are giving your
[1:01:14] all and you are depending on him
[1:01:16] and then he's just going to abandon you
[1:01:19] that is not the God we are serving
[1:01:24] and they saw so much of God in the land
[1:01:27] of Egypt
[1:01:28] and in their Journey so much and yet
[1:01:32] they get to a point to think that God
[1:01:35] has abandoned us at this point
[1:01:39] and they prevailed on Aaron
[1:01:42] to build them a molting image
[1:01:45] and Aaron did it and even built an altar
[1:01:48] in front of this image and they went and
[1:01:51] they were offering sacrifices and they
[1:01:54] were saying this is the gods that
[1:01:55] brought us out of Egypt and they were
[1:01:57] giving worship to idols
[1:02:01] foreign
[1:02:06] limiting God
[1:02:09] limiting God
[1:02:13] when you begin to give that which
[1:02:16] belongs to God
[1:02:18] to idols
[1:02:21] you have limited God
[1:02:25] delimited the authority of God
[1:02:28] they limited him
[1:02:30] right that the almighty God
[1:02:34] who created the heavens and the Earth by
[1:02:36] his spoken word
[1:02:39] it wasn't as safe this word was existing
[1:02:41] no
[1:02:43] everything we see was spoken into
[1:02:46] existence
[1:02:47] that they saw the arm of God leading
[1:02:51] them and yet they can build molting
[1:02:54] images
[1:02:56] and then they said these are the gods
[1:02:58] that brought us out of Egypt what an
[1:03:00] insult
[1:03:03] and God told Moses
[1:03:06] the children of Israel have turned back
[1:03:08] from following me
[1:03:10] this is what they have done and you know
[1:03:12] Moses I am going to destroy all of them
[1:03:15] and I'm going to raise
[1:03:17] a generation unto you
[1:03:20] and Moses said no
[1:03:22] don't do it
[1:03:25] if you do it
[1:03:27] what do you think the Egyptians are
[1:03:28] going to say
[1:03:31] oh God come out of Egypt and go to the
[1:03:34] Wilderness and destroyed all of them
[1:03:37] dear God took them and said he was going
[1:03:40] to give them a land flowing with milk
[1:03:42] and honey only to kill all of them in
[1:03:44] the wilderness do you know what our
[1:03:46] adversaries would say don't do it
[1:03:49] remember remember
[1:03:50] Abraham remember Isaac remember Israel
[1:03:53] for their sake and the promise you made
[1:03:56] to their Generations after remember them
[1:04:01] and repent of your Wrath
[1:04:04] a man talking to God
[1:04:08] and God listened
[1:04:11] praise be to God
[1:04:13] that when Moses came to the camp and he
[1:04:16] saw what was going on
[1:04:18] he himself couldn't hold back his Wrath
[1:04:21] and we know the story
[1:04:24] how 3 000 people fell by the sword
[1:04:27] praise be to God
[1:04:30] to undermine the authority of God
[1:04:34] comes at a cost
[1:04:36] but we humans we very often
[1:04:40] forget
[1:04:43] and I want to encourage us tonight
[1:04:46] never forget where God took you from
[1:04:50] never forget
[1:04:55] I mean if you ever get to a place
[1:04:59] to forget where he took you from
[1:05:02] to forget of his mercies
[1:05:05] to forget of his grace
[1:05:08] to forget of his love
[1:05:12] what else is left
[1:05:16] because we show appreciation to God
[1:05:21] because we learn to remember
[1:05:25] who we once were
[1:05:29] and who we are today
[1:05:31] and we can look back
[1:05:34] and we see where he took us from
[1:05:37] and how far he has brought us
[1:05:40] and we are thankful
[1:05:43] of course if you want the most untenable
[1:05:46] generation that ever lived I believe it
[1:05:49] will be this generation
[1:05:52] I believe it will be this generation
[1:05:58] one time we're looking for an apartment
[1:06:03] and then we've got to a place
[1:06:05] and a man just for the fell in love with
[1:06:08] my little boys
[1:06:13] why because
[1:06:14] he gave them candy
[1:06:16] and they said thank you
[1:06:21] praise the Lord
[1:06:23] and he said
[1:06:24] he has his own
[1:06:26] um
[1:06:29] Sports
[1:06:31] um
[1:06:32] his spell he sells sports equipment and
[1:06:34] things
[1:06:36] and he was and either he was or he's
[1:06:38] still a coach
[1:06:40] a football coach and then he said to
[1:06:43] himself I think he and his wife that
[1:06:46] anybody that comes to shop
[1:06:49] and then after shopping
[1:06:52] they said thank you
[1:06:54] they were going to take the bill I think
[1:06:57] up to three thousand dollars
[1:07:00] they never said it to anybody but
[1:07:03] between them they knew that this was the
[1:07:05] promise they had made
[1:07:07] and guess what
[1:07:08] I don't know it's a long time beginning
[1:07:10] to forget either he sat for three months
[1:07:15] people walked in and bought this and
[1:07:17] went out nobody ever said thank you
[1:07:22] is the generation we are living in
[1:07:26] people don't appreciate anything
[1:07:30] learn to keep reminding yourself
[1:07:33] of the goodness of the Lord
[1:07:35] of his grace of his loving kindness of
[1:07:39] his standard hand of Mercy
[1:07:40] of his Divine protection
[1:07:43] never forget it
[1:07:46] if you can forget these things
[1:07:49] there is no room for Thanksgiving
[1:07:56] praise be to God
[1:08:02] limiting God
[1:08:08] to think
[1:08:13] that God is never going to follow up on
[1:08:16] his word
[1:08:19] you have limited God
[1:08:24] by the time we get to this end we get it
[1:08:27] to the end of this
[1:08:29] you may have realized
[1:08:34] in one way or the other
[1:08:39] that you may have been guilty sure
[1:08:44] not to take God at his word is limiting
[1:08:48] God
[1:08:50] to think
[1:08:53] that God is not going to follow through
[1:08:56] with his word
[1:08:58] have limited God
[1:09:02] foreign
[1:09:05] we have the tendency
[1:09:07] to say things
[1:09:10] we just speak big and yet we don't have
[1:09:14] what it takes
[1:09:16] to back it up
[1:09:21] we say that we know we are not going to
[1:09:23] do it
[1:09:25] we are excited because that's why the
[1:09:27] people want to hear
[1:09:29] you think about the politicians and when
[1:09:32] they are on their campaign trips
[1:09:33] they will tell you they are going to
[1:09:35] build a bridge
[1:09:36] and you look around there is no River in
[1:09:38] a way
[1:09:41] praise be to God
[1:09:43] how do you build a build a bridge
[1:09:45] on a here we don't need a bridge here
[1:09:48] but that's what the people want to hear
[1:09:52] it is not so with God
[1:09:55] anything God says he means it exactly
[1:09:59] the same way
[1:10:03] never never never
[1:10:05] look at the word of God
[1:10:08] and begin to wonder why it is where it
[1:10:12] is
[1:10:13] it is there for a reason
[1:10:17] you may never have come to that
[1:10:19] realization you may you you may not have
[1:10:23] caught
[1:10:25] the revelation of it
[1:10:27] but it is sitting there for everything
[1:10:32] every promise God has made to his
[1:10:35] children he makes it exactly the same
[1:10:39] God would not tell you he will do this
[1:10:41] and not do it
[1:10:45] he will do exactly what he says he would
[1:10:50] nothing can stop him no praise be to God
[1:10:55] does not play with words
[1:10:59] he is not a man that he should lie
[1:11:03] the promises of God are true
[1:11:07] I'm challenging your faith tonight
[1:11:12] tell God by his promise
[1:11:16] it may seem impossible to you
[1:11:19] that is okay
[1:11:23] but there is nothing impossible for God
[1:11:27] take God at his word
[1:11:29] whatever it is
[1:11:33] I don't know what you are going through
[1:11:37] but if you have any request before God
[1:11:41] take God at his word
[1:11:44] do not let your faith waver
[1:11:52] do not give God
[1:11:55] the small small things
[1:11:59] no give you the victims
[1:12:04] the things that you think are impossible
[1:12:08] the things that you think are too hard
[1:12:13] that is what God is waiting for
[1:12:18] a lot of the times
[1:12:20] we are in our own way
[1:12:23] you may think it's your brother is your
[1:12:25] sister is the devil and a lot of the
[1:12:28] times we are in our own way
[1:12:35] you are your own devil
[1:12:40] praise be to God
[1:12:44] you are in your own way
[1:12:46] get out of the way
[1:12:48] get out of the way and let God be God
[1:12:54] if you want to see the glory of God
[1:12:58] get out of the way
[1:13:01] let your faith
[1:13:09] I don't know if this time is correct
[1:13:12] praise the Lord
[1:13:15] get out of the way
[1:13:19] if you want to see the glory of God
[1:13:22] if you don't want to see it
[1:13:24] that is a different thing altogether
[1:13:28] but if you want to see the glory of God
[1:13:31] get out of the way
[1:13:37] limiting God
[1:13:39] now
[1:13:40] I want us to look at
[1:13:42] a few things here
[1:13:47] that when a man
[1:13:49] gets to a place
[1:13:51] to trust in the ability of men
[1:13:55] other than trusting
[1:13:57] in God
[1:13:59] you have limited God
[1:14:02] you are trusted in the arm of Flesh
[1:14:07] a man that will go to bed and does not
[1:14:10] know whether he's going to rise up the
[1:14:11] following day or not
[1:14:13] that we put so much trust in men
[1:14:19] other than God
[1:14:20] right
[1:14:22] to trust in the ability whether it is
[1:14:26] your personal ability you are trusting
[1:14:27] in or you are trusted in the ability of
[1:14:30] your father the ability of your your
[1:14:33] sister your ability of a brother your
[1:14:35] neighbor
[1:14:37] instead of trusting in God
[1:14:40] you have lived
[1:14:43] while we are still seated if you can
[1:14:46] open your Bibles
[1:14:51] to
[1:14:55] Jeremiah 27
[1:14:59] Jeremiah 27.
[1:15:04] six to eight
[1:15:07] Jeremiah 27
[1:15:10] 6-8
[1:15:18] and now have I given all those lands
[1:15:24] God speaking
[1:15:26] and now have I given all those lands
[1:15:29] into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
[1:15:33] of Babylon my servant
[1:15:35] God calling
[1:15:37] the hidden King
[1:15:39] his servant
[1:15:41] it's another thing we can talk about
[1:15:43] praise be to God
[1:15:46] and the Beast of the fields
[1:15:48] have I given him also to serve him
[1:15:52] and All Nations Shall Serve him and his
[1:15:56] son and his son's son until the very
[1:16:00] time of his land
[1:16:04] until the very time of his land come
[1:16:09] and then many nations and great Kings
[1:16:13] Shall Serve themselves of him
[1:16:17] and it shall come to pass
[1:16:19] that the Nations
[1:16:21] and Kingdom
[1:16:23] which will not serve the same
[1:16:27] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[1:16:30] and that will not
[1:16:35] put their neck under the Yoke of the
[1:16:37] king of Babylon that Nation will I
[1:16:40] punish say the Lord
[1:16:42] with the sword and with the famine and
[1:16:46] with the pestilence until I have
[1:16:48] consumed them
[1:16:50] by his hand
[1:16:52] praise be to God
[1:16:55] so you look at Nebuchadnezzar
[1:16:58] the king of Babylon
[1:17:01] and you see
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:04] he had a very
[1:17:06] strong Kingdom
[1:17:10] and he arraigned
[1:17:13] he has so much power
[1:17:15] but when you look at this scripture here
[1:17:18] you know that it was not Nebuchadnezzar
[1:17:23] it was in Nebuchadnezzar
[1:17:29] we just said a while ago that trusting
[1:17:32] in the ability of men
[1:17:35] whether it's in your personal ability or
[1:17:38] the ability of someone else you are
[1:17:40] limiting God
[1:17:42] and we'll write this for a very good
[1:17:44] reason can we just go through Daniel
[1:17:48] Daniel
[1:17:50] 4. Daniel 4 30.
[1:18:07] okay
[1:18:09] Daniel
[1:18:11] 4 30
[1:18:15] okay
[1:18:17] the king speak
[1:18:19] and said
[1:18:21] this is Nebuchadnezzar speaking
[1:18:23] the king spake and said it's not this
[1:18:27] great Babylon
[1:18:28] that I have built
[1:18:31] for the house of the Kingdom
[1:18:33] by the might of my power
[1:18:37] and for the honor of my Majesty
[1:18:42] why the word was still in the king's
[1:18:45] mouth
[1:18:47] that fell a voice from Heaven saying
[1:18:49] okay Nebuchadnezzar today it is spoken
[1:18:54] the kingdom is departed from thee
[1:18:57] praise be to God
[1:19:03] 32
[1:19:05] and they shall Drive thee from men and
[1:19:08] thy dwelling shall be with the Beast of
[1:19:11] the field
[1:19:12] they shall make thee to eat grass as
[1:19:14] oxen and seven times shall pass over
[1:19:18] thee until thou know
[1:19:20] that the most high rulers in the Kingdom
[1:19:25] of men and give away to whomsoever he
[1:19:28] will
[1:19:28] 33 the same hour was the 10 fulfilled
[1:19:33] upon the wicked NASA and he was driven
[1:19:36] from men and he did eat grass as oxen
[1:19:39] and his body was wet with the Dew of
[1:19:41] Heaven till his hair were grown like
[1:19:45] Eagle's feathers and his nails
[1:19:48] like best clothes
[1:19:54] praise be to God
[1:19:57] he was not seeing God
[1:20:02] in his kingdom
[1:20:05] he didn't have the fear of God
[1:20:09] in that he he saw
[1:20:12] he took the credit
[1:20:15] God was not in the equation
[1:20:18] he was looking at his might
[1:20:21] he thought he was the one doing it
[1:20:27] counting on his personal ability
[1:20:30] and God looked at him and said you
[1:20:33] you are going to compete for grass in
[1:20:36] the bush
[1:20:38] and the book called NASA a king that was
[1:20:40] so much feared
[1:20:42] whose name
[1:20:45] every Kingdom feared
[1:20:47] that man became a beast
[1:20:52] and he was in the bush
[1:20:55] at grass
[1:20:57] the Dew of Heaven made him wet
[1:21:02] all these
[1:21:05] are written down for our our example
[1:21:09] never trust in your ability
[1:21:13] let your trust be in God
[1:21:17] and if you put your trust in God
[1:21:20] God Will Never Let You Down
[1:21:22] God will never put you to shame
[1:21:25] when God is increasing you God is
[1:21:29] flourishing your life God is blessing
[1:21:31] with his goodness God is just increasing
[1:21:34] making Miracles things happening in your
[1:21:37] life remember that it is not you
[1:21:41] remember that there is a God in your
[1:21:44] life who is behind all this and give him
[1:21:47] the glory for it
[1:21:52] God loves it when he does something and
[1:21:56] you can come back and praise him for it
[1:21:59] we can talk about the 10 lepers
[1:22:03] God doesn't take that lightly and don't
[1:22:06] take it lightly
[1:22:08] praise be to God never trust
[1:22:11] in the ability of man
[1:22:14] whether your personal ability
[1:22:16] or someone else's ability never trust
[1:22:20] now David was a man
[1:22:23] that trusted in God
[1:22:26] amen
[1:22:28] that knew who his God was
[1:22:31] he believed in God
[1:22:34] but David did something
[1:22:36] that God was not happy with
[1:22:39] if we contend to First Chronicles 21.
[1:22:51] First Chronicles 21.
[1:22:55] one to six
[1:22:58] and Satan stood up against Israel and
[1:23:01] provoked David to number Israel
[1:23:06] and David said to joab
[1:23:09] and to the rulers of the people good
[1:23:11] number is right from Bathsheba even to
[1:23:14] Dan and bring the number of them to me
[1:23:19] that I may know it
[1:23:22] and job answered listen to what job said
[1:23:26] the Lord make his people a hundred times
[1:23:30] so many more
[1:23:32] as they be
[1:23:36] but my Lord
[1:23:38] the king are they not all my lost
[1:23:42] servant
[1:23:43] why then do have my Lord require this
[1:23:46] thing
[1:23:48] why will he be a cause of trespass to
[1:23:53] Israel
[1:23:54] now when you continue to read down it
[1:23:58] says that
[1:23:59] the king's order prevailed
[1:24:03] and they had to go and number Israel now
[1:24:07] when you go further
[1:24:12] you would hear
[1:24:14] that the numbers they counted of men
[1:24:17] with sword men with sword men with sword
[1:24:22] murder could go to battle
[1:24:26] David was counting in numbers
[1:24:29] looking at the size size of the people
[1:24:32] counting numbers
[1:24:34] but God does not move by numbers
[1:24:40] God doesn't care with numbers
[1:24:44] said minority with God is the majority
[1:24:50] and George you have just narrowed it
[1:24:53] down
[1:24:56] that the people of God are hundred times
[1:24:59] more than they are
[1:25:02] so when you are putting a limit to the
[1:25:05] number
[1:25:07] when God is not looking at number
[1:25:11] then there is there is there is a
[1:25:13] problem right here
[1:25:17] so it looked very much
[1:25:21] like David was counting
[1:25:23] on the men of Israel
[1:25:26] on their strength on their human
[1:25:28] strength till he forgot
[1:25:31] that they have a god
[1:25:34] and God was not happy with him
[1:25:36] if you go down God gave him three things
[1:25:39] to choose from
[1:25:41] and when I read it I was just wondering
[1:25:45] which one would you choose
[1:25:48] praise be to God
[1:25:50] and tens of thousands of people died
[1:25:53] because of this
[1:25:57] so the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:25:59] David
[1:26:00] and told him to go if I sacrifice
[1:26:04] and then the wrath of God stayed
[1:26:10] never trust in any human ability
[1:26:14] as a child of God know that your trust
[1:26:18] is in God
[1:26:23] I don't care what achievements you ever
[1:26:25] get in this life
[1:26:26] I don't care how high you ever go
[1:26:29] I don't care what people tell you
[1:26:32] remember
[1:26:35] who you are as a child of God
[1:26:38] let your trust
[1:26:41] be in God
[1:26:43] praise be to God
[1:26:53] when you also think that you have a
[1:26:55] better option
[1:26:58] that you know better
[1:27:02] that is a very dangerous position to be
[1:27:04] in
[1:27:05] a very very dangerous position
[1:27:09] and we can talk about some of these
[1:27:11] things over and over
[1:27:15] can you imagine standing before a blind
[1:27:17] man
[1:27:18] and then you are looking at the wall
[1:27:20] here
[1:27:21] you say oh there is a portrait
[1:27:24] of Jesus on the wall here
[1:27:26] I know this person is blind and they are
[1:27:29] saying no it's not here
[1:27:31] this one is in the foyer
[1:27:34] can you imagine how that picture
[1:27:36] resonates I mean
[1:27:38] how how how how it feels or how it it
[1:27:41] looks
[1:27:45] when you look at the life of soul
[1:27:48] God sent Saul to go and destroy the
[1:27:51] amalekites
[1:27:53] because when God delivered the children
[1:27:56] of Israel from captivity
[1:27:58] amalek stood in their way and God did
[1:28:01] not forgive them
[1:28:05] when you fight a child of God
[1:28:08] you are fighting against God
[1:28:13] when people are fighting against you
[1:28:17] remember they are fighting against God
[1:28:22] whether Abraham says somewhere
[1:28:26] that when someone talks about you
[1:28:29] and you talk about them
[1:28:31] that God cannot fight that battle for
[1:28:33] you
[1:28:35] if you trying
[1:28:39] but if you want God to fight your
[1:28:41] battles for you
[1:28:43] when they level you
[1:28:45] are the wrong accusations coming
[1:28:48] calling you all those names
[1:28:51] giving you I mean more treating you
[1:28:54] doing things that she didn't do laughing
[1:28:57] at you all the slim callings you know
[1:29:00] what if you want God to fight your
[1:29:02] battle just keep your calm
[1:29:05] praise be to God
[1:29:08] praise be to God
[1:29:10] if you're calm
[1:29:12] a lot of the times we are unable to keep
[1:29:15] our calm we got to that place I said no
[1:29:18] I will not sit down for everything I'm a
[1:29:20] fool
[1:29:21] guess what you just ruined it
[1:29:24] you just ruined it
[1:29:27] praise the Lord
[1:29:33] the battle is the Lost Barrel
[1:29:37] it's not your personal Barrel
[1:29:41] anybody that will rise against you as a
[1:29:43] daughter of God anybody that will rise
[1:29:45] against you as a Son of God they have
[1:29:48] risen against God yeah
[1:29:51] that was why when the pillar of Fire
[1:29:54] truck saw before he became poor and he
[1:29:58] started Damascus
[1:30:00] he said why are you persecuting me he
[1:30:03] didn't say why he persecuting the
[1:30:05] Believers no
[1:30:06] why are you persecuting me
[1:30:10] be careful
[1:30:13] how you treat the children of God
[1:30:21] God never forgive amalek
[1:30:24] and when Saul was anointed king
[1:30:27] he was given Specific Instructions to go
[1:30:30] and destroy amalek
[1:30:32] from the King to his servant male and
[1:30:36] female old and young
[1:30:39] circles
[1:30:40] kill everybody destroy everything all
[1:30:43] the animals
[1:30:45] and what they saw do
[1:30:47] Saul went
[1:30:49] destroyed as much as he could
[1:30:52] and then he left the king you know
[1:30:56] and then the the nice nice looking sheep
[1:31:01] he took them
[1:31:03] blessed destroyed them
[1:31:05] destroy them
[1:31:07] Saul says no I have a better idea
[1:31:11] we can use this as a sacrifice for God
[1:31:15] says destroy them
[1:31:19] the Bible says to obey is better than
[1:31:22] sacrifice
[1:31:23] and to here again than the fat of bulls
[1:31:30] just obey
[1:31:34] don't think you have a better option
[1:31:37] don't think you have a better idea
[1:31:41] God at this word you may not understand
[1:31:45] it
[1:31:47] it's okay not to understand it
[1:31:51] that does not give you cause or room
[1:31:55] to think
[1:31:57] that you can put your mind or your own
[1:31:59] opinion to it
[1:32:04] that is a dangerous place
[1:32:06] to be
[1:32:07] to think that you as a child of God you
[1:32:11] as a human being
[1:32:13] no better than God
[1:32:15] you have limited God
[1:32:18] in a very great way
[1:32:24] and Saul's Kingdom
[1:32:26] was taken away from him
[1:32:30] Saul's Kingdom was taken away from him
[1:32:37] limiting God I just realized that
[1:32:40] I went past behind my time I'm sorry
[1:32:43] about that in advance
[1:32:46] but um I wouldn't keep you as long as I
[1:32:49] did the last time
[1:32:52] I know some people got to work late
[1:32:56] um
[1:32:57] I know some people got to work late
[1:32:59] praise be to God I wouldn't keep you
[1:33:01] that long
[1:33:04] foreign
[1:33:08] you have a better option
[1:33:11] it's a dangerous place to be
[1:33:14] and you can also
[1:33:16] overstep your god-given boundary
[1:33:20] and overstepping your god-giving
[1:33:22] boundary is a place you don't want to be
[1:33:29] overstepping your god-given boundary is
[1:33:32] a place you don't want to be
[1:33:35] we all hear of King uzia
[1:33:41] ozia
[1:33:42] at the age of 16.
[1:33:45] was anointed king
[1:33:47] all the people loved him
[1:33:51] he was a king that was so much loved
[1:33:54] and as a matter of fact he had a very
[1:33:57] successful reign
[1:33:59] he feared God
[1:34:01] he sought the face of God
[1:34:04] and the Bible says
[1:34:06] as long as he saw the face of God God
[1:34:09] prospered him
[1:34:11] you want prosperity
[1:34:18] concerning every aspect of your life
[1:34:21] seek the face of God don't go to God
[1:34:24] with already your mind already made up
[1:34:28] and then you already know what to do
[1:34:30] and then you go and then you say you are
[1:34:33] seeking the face of God
[1:34:35] don't waste your time
[1:34:38] don't waste your time
[1:34:41] because you're not here from God
[1:34:46] I had one old one old Muslim friend
[1:34:51] at the time I think he was 92
[1:34:55] at a time that was uh 15 years ago
[1:35:00] I don't know if he's still alive
[1:35:02] and he was a Muslim
[1:35:05] and I remember I used to go just sit by
[1:35:07] the roadside with him and then we just
[1:35:09] you know talk talk and I'll get up and
[1:35:11] go home
[1:35:12] and then one time
[1:35:14] he said he was in the house
[1:35:16] and somebody came to the house to pray
[1:35:19] in his house to pray and he knew that
[1:35:22] this person had stolen something from
[1:35:24] his house before
[1:35:26] so when the guy came and he was praying
[1:35:28] he went and took a whip
[1:35:35] I wonder when the man went down if you
[1:35:37] know how those people pray the man went
[1:35:39] down
[1:35:52] praise the Lord
[1:36:00] he came behind him
[1:36:12] with that long whip
[1:36:17] and he whipped him
[1:36:19] and the man jumped up and started
[1:36:22] running away
[1:36:23] he said you come to my house and steal
[1:36:25] and you come to the same house and to
[1:36:27] pray he said no it's not going to happen
[1:36:36] we go to God sometimes with our minds
[1:36:39] made up
[1:36:40] and we know in our hearts that our minds
[1:36:43] are already made up we know what we want
[1:36:45] to do and then we go and then we kneel
[1:36:47] and say we are praying
[1:36:51] God is a good god
[1:36:53] is a good god
[1:36:56] yes
[1:36:58] can you imagine him sending an angel
[1:36:59] behind you with a long whip
[1:37:04] praise be to God
[1:37:10] what are we talking about here tonight
[1:37:17] overstepping your boundaries
[1:37:20] Ozil was so much loved
[1:37:23] he was a darling boy
[1:37:26] God prospered his race so much
[1:37:29] his name went beyond the conference of
[1:37:32] Israel
[1:37:35] and he was favored
[1:37:39] a lot of the times children of God
[1:37:42] when we are seeing so much of God in our
[1:37:44] lives instead of us becoming a little
[1:37:47] more careful we got Reckless
[1:37:50] and that was why King uzia got to
[1:37:54] go he as a king got up and went into the
[1:37:58] temple
[1:37:59] to go and burn incense
[1:38:01] on the altar of incense
[1:38:04] and when he swung in
[1:38:08] the priest stopped him
[1:38:11] said no King this is not your office
[1:38:13] you have your office
[1:38:16] you have your god-giving grounds
[1:38:19] and he fought them anyhow the Bible says
[1:38:22] he was rough with them
[1:38:23] and he still went ahead anyhow
[1:38:26] to bend the incense and write that God
[1:38:28] struck him with leprosy
[1:38:32] he just bursts on his forehead
[1:38:36] that when the king the the the the the
[1:38:38] the the priest saw it oh
[1:38:41] you know how dangerous that thing is
[1:38:43] right
[1:38:45] and then he himself started running away
[1:38:47] he knew that no the Judgment of God had
[1:38:49] come upon him
[1:38:51] and that was the end of his reign
[1:38:54] overstepping your god-given boundaries
[1:39:00] no
[1:39:02] that as a child of God
[1:39:05] we are not called to be reckless in our
[1:39:08] decision making
[1:39:11] we are children of God rested with power
[1:39:15] and authority yes
[1:39:18] and so long as
[1:39:21] you are walking according to the word
[1:39:24] there is nothing to fear
[1:39:27] let the word be your guide
[1:39:29] let the word be your absolute
[1:39:33] do not turn left do not turn right from
[1:39:35] the word let the word lead you
[1:39:39] Thy word is a love unto my feet
[1:39:41] if the word of God leads you there is no
[1:39:44] way you're ever going to stumble
[1:39:47] you can't stumble
[1:39:49] the word lightens your path
[1:39:53] you see your way clearly
[1:39:55] but the problem is sometimes we get to a
[1:39:58] place
[1:40:01] we want to overstep our boundaries
[1:40:06] and that is not a place you a child of
[1:40:08] God wants to be
[1:40:13] praise be to God
[1:40:19] foreign
[1:40:23] he took the grace of God for granted
[1:40:28] he took the blessings of God for granted
[1:40:32] he took the protection of God for
[1:40:35] granted
[1:40:37] the love of God he took the love of God
[1:40:40] for granted
[1:40:45] do you see yourself there
[1:40:48] how often
[1:40:51] we take
[1:40:52] things for granted
[1:40:56] we take the grace of God for granted
[1:40:59] we say oh God loves me so much
[1:41:02] and that becomes a problem
[1:41:07] and because of that
[1:41:09] we do things we should
[1:41:14] God is Swift in his judgment
[1:41:18] remember
[1:41:20] that God is still a consuming fire he
[1:41:23] has not changed
[1:41:26] is The Blood On The Mercy Seat
[1:41:31] is The Blood On The Mercy Seat
[1:41:35] but God is still the same consuming fire
[1:41:40] there was a vision
[1:41:42] where the brother was talking about a
[1:41:45] world that was hanging in the air
[1:41:48] with a rainbow around it
[1:41:52] and I know you guys remember that story
[1:41:56] and that was when he had just finished
[1:41:58] condemning a woman
[1:42:00] and then he came and he saw that vision
[1:42:03] and his the danger of the Lord told him
[1:42:05] that
[1:42:07] this rainbow you see
[1:42:09] it's just the blood of Christ that is
[1:42:11] covering the world the sin of the world
[1:42:14] is serving us a bumper
[1:42:17] as a bumper
[1:42:22] stopping the wrath of God
[1:42:29] and brother said if it wasn't for the
[1:42:33] blood God will wipe this earth away
[1:42:36] I don't know whether he said in minutes
[1:42:38] or in seconds
[1:42:40] he will destroy it in a moment
[1:42:43] if it wasn't for the blood
[1:42:48] and you wonder
[1:42:50] talking about
[1:42:52] you can probably look at your personal
[1:42:54] life and you can tell why you have been
[1:42:57] guilty of either one or two or all of
[1:42:59] these things and you are still alive
[1:43:02] what is it
[1:43:05] the blood
[1:43:07] the blood
[1:43:08] the blood seven as a bumper
[1:43:11] to the wrath of God
[1:43:14] giving you room to repent
[1:43:17] giving you room to make things right
[1:43:19] giving you room to straighten your life
[1:43:23] giving you room to line up your life to
[1:43:26] clean the mess in your life
[1:43:28] the blood that is keeping you
[1:43:34] and we can take things for granted
[1:43:37] do things we shouldn't do
[1:43:39] settings we shouldn't go settings we
[1:43:41] shouldn't say go to places we shouldn't
[1:43:43] go
[1:43:46] sometimes we forget Who We Are
[1:43:49] we only remember when it's Sunday or
[1:43:51] Wednesdays
[1:43:54] that is when we remember
[1:43:56] Who We Are
[1:43:59] but do not be forgetful
[1:44:02] remind yourself every day
[1:44:05] when you get up in the morning
[1:44:08] just look at yourself in the mirror of
[1:44:10] the word of God
[1:44:12] and tell yourself I am a Son of God I am
[1:44:15] a daughter of God I am here to reflect
[1:44:18] the beauty of Christ that people will
[1:44:21] see my good works and give the glory to
[1:44:23] my father you know you can so much leave
[1:44:26] the word of God so much so that when
[1:44:30] people around you are living in error
[1:44:32] look they get rebuked
[1:44:35] you don't even have to open your mouth
[1:44:37] they look at your life and they feel
[1:44:39] condemned
[1:44:45] just live by the world
[1:44:48] live by the
[1:44:49] Bible read the word don't let somebody
[1:44:52] come and ask you to read your word the
[1:44:54] Bible don't let somebody come and ask
[1:44:57] you I mean just just
[1:45:00] I don't know I don't know how else we
[1:45:03] can say it
[1:45:05] I pray that the almighty God would have
[1:45:07] every one of us
[1:45:10] yeah
[1:45:13] press Beauty God
[1:45:17] let your faith
[1:45:19] let your faith
[1:45:22] anchor in the word
[1:45:24] praise be to God
[1:45:26] never
[1:45:28] go to a place
[1:45:32] to take things for granted
[1:45:38] stop questioning the authority of God
[1:45:41] I will probably make this the last one
[1:45:45] I will probably make this the last one
[1:45:54] yes I'll make this the last one I
[1:45:57] promise
[1:46:00] praise the Lord
[1:46:02] when people question the authority of
[1:46:04] God
[1:46:06] and to question the authority of God
[1:46:10] means you are limiting God
[1:46:15] on what grounds
[1:46:17] can a man
[1:46:19] question the authority of the almighty
[1:46:21] God
[1:46:25] has he said it and has not done it
[1:46:30] has he made any promises
[1:46:33] and has not fulfilled them
[1:46:39] anytime
[1:46:42] you think you are believing the words so
[1:46:44] much and you are not seeing result look
[1:46:47] at you
[1:46:49] the problem is never with the word of
[1:46:51] God
[1:46:53] there can never be any problem with this
[1:46:56] word
[1:46:58] the problem is always you
[1:47:06] Sarah
[1:47:12] when God spoke to you
[1:47:14] Abraham and told him according to the
[1:47:16] time of life
[1:47:19] his wife Sarah
[1:47:21] was going to conceive and buy him a son
[1:47:24] and Sarah had it in the tent
[1:47:27] as the Bible says she laughed
[1:47:29] in her heart
[1:47:34] me old lady like this
[1:47:40] they say me oh lady like me
[1:47:43] she doesn't know how old I am
[1:47:46] that woman my age don't give birth
[1:47:50] does he really know what he's talking
[1:47:51] about
[1:47:53] and God asked why is Sarah laughing
[1:47:57] the Bible says she feared and she said
[1:47:59] no she wasn't laughing but she was
[1:48:01] laughing
[1:48:05] questioning the authority of God
[1:48:09] you know
[1:48:11] I have down here also doubt and
[1:48:14] um I know I promise I'll stop here I
[1:48:17] will not go beyond but you know our
[1:48:20] doubts and our misbehavior and all those
[1:48:23] things
[1:48:24] would not stop God
[1:48:27] it wouldn't stop God
[1:48:31] it rather makes life
[1:48:33] hard for you
[1:48:36] it makes things more difficult for you
[1:48:40] but that would not hinder God
[1:48:43] praise be to God
[1:48:47] Sarah
[1:48:49] Brown said
[1:48:54] that to limit the church today
[1:48:58] and its possibilities
[1:49:00] is that you are limiting God
[1:49:04] if you limit the Church of the Living
[1:49:06] God
[1:49:09] Christ among his people
[1:49:12] Christ in his church
[1:49:14] the redeemed of the Lord with thus say
[1:49:17] yes the Lord
[1:49:19] if you limit that body of Christ
[1:49:22] you are limiting God
[1:49:25] if limiting them in their possibilities
[1:49:27] in what they can do you are limiting God
[1:49:32] and he goes on to say
[1:49:36] that the hardest thing for God
[1:49:42] the only thing that is limiting God is
[1:49:45] our faith
[1:49:49] the only thing that is limiting God is
[1:49:52] our faith
[1:49:53] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:49:57] there is nothing
[1:49:58] too hard for the Lord
[1:50:05] says
[1:50:09] that the only thing that is that that
[1:50:11] makes it very hard very hard
[1:50:15] it's our faith
[1:50:18] there is no problem with the word of God
[1:50:21] it is our faith
[1:50:24] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:50:28] do you think
[1:50:30] that God
[1:50:32] would save your life
[1:50:37] I can tell you the number of times God
[1:50:39] has saved my life and that is going to
[1:50:41] take the next 30 minutes
[1:50:44] praise the Lord not once not twice so I
[1:50:48] am going to leave it here
[1:50:50] one day we'll talk about them
[1:50:54] think of how God has saved your life
[1:50:57] why he took you from
[1:50:59] from The Rush that you wear
[1:51:02] living in sin
[1:51:04] so much impoverished in debt
[1:51:08] living in iniquity
[1:51:11] living in a mess
[1:51:15] you were at your lowest
[1:51:18] and God reached out then
[1:51:22] and took you from that place
[1:51:25] and he has washed You by his word he has
[1:51:28] cleansed you by the blood he has healed
[1:51:31] you from every sickness from every
[1:51:34] disease from every infirmity from all
[1:51:37] the charms and spells the enemy has cast
[1:51:39] upon you he has granted you a closer
[1:51:42] walk with him that he is with you by day
[1:51:44] and by night and that you can feel the
[1:51:46] presence of God in your daily work and
[1:51:49] you know that God is with you and yet
[1:51:52] you you get to a place and you look at
[1:51:54] some situations and you say no this is
[1:51:57] too hard
[1:51:58] it's anything
[1:52:05] God would not answer this prayer it's
[1:52:07] anything too hard for the Lord
[1:52:11] no I have to deal with this by myself
[1:52:13] since when did you start dealing with
[1:52:16] things by yourself
[1:52:22] let God be God
[1:52:24] let God be God
[1:52:28] in whatever situation you find yourself
[1:52:31] remember
[1:52:33] that there is nothing too hard for the
[1:52:35] Lord
[1:52:37] and all the difficult problems you have
[1:52:42] all the impossibilities you have
[1:52:46] it's good to have them
[1:52:47] it's good to have them
[1:52:50] because we have a god
[1:52:54] who is an expert
[1:52:56] in handling those things
[1:53:01] it's good to have them the
[1:53:03] impossibilities the difficult situations
[1:53:05] the storms it's good to have them
[1:53:10] it's only bad
[1:53:13] to have them
[1:53:14] when you don't know where to direct them
[1:53:19] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:53:22] I made a promise I will end this right
[1:53:25] here so what we've been talking about or
[1:53:28] what we've been trying to talk about
[1:53:30] is that oftentimes
[1:53:33] we forget of the goodness of the Lord
[1:53:35] musicians can come over
[1:53:37] we forget how Mad God has loved us
[1:53:42] we forget
[1:53:44] how God for the love he has for you and
[1:53:48] I God chose to become a man
[1:53:52] that everything he suffered
[1:53:55] it was because of you and me everything
[1:53:57] he went through it was because of you
[1:54:00] and me he gave this all for our sake our
[1:54:05] sake he was humiliated
[1:54:08] he was humiliated
[1:54:10] put to death on the
[1:54:12] called names for our sake
[1:54:16] he loves this throne above his glory
[1:54:19] just to become a man
[1:54:22] so he could die
[1:54:24] he became sin so we would become the
[1:54:28] very righteousness of God
[1:54:29] for our sake
[1:54:31] and God would go all through this all
[1:54:35] through all this
[1:54:37] and they say you know what
[1:54:40] I'll leave you halfway
[1:54:41] find your way out
[1:54:44] can you ever imagine that
[1:54:47] he is with us till the end of the
[1:54:50] journey
[1:54:51] and not only till the end of the journey
[1:54:54] but he is with us
[1:54:56] beyond the end of the journey
[1:55:00] because when we get to that place
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:04] where no other man can follow
[1:55:07] now your time on Earth comes to an end
[1:55:10] and that people beat you they carry and
[1:55:13] they bid you farewell
[1:55:14] he is there
[1:55:17] to carry you beyond
[1:55:20] he has never given up on us
[1:55:23] and he never will
[1:55:26] he would never give up on us

[1:55:58] I want us to go before the Lord in
[1:56:00] prayer
[1:56:02] and I just talked to God
[1:56:03] [Music]
[1:56:06] there are many ways that we have limited
[1:56:10] god without even knowing it
[1:56:14] when we look at situations
[1:56:16] on their face value
[1:56:20] and then we don't see God and all we see
[1:56:22] is the situation or the problem
[1:56:24] and we try to figure it out in our own
[1:56:27] way instead of seeking the face of God
[1:56:31] and we forget that we have a god
[1:56:34] in a way we have limited God
[1:56:38] when we try to handle situations
[1:56:41] in our own way
[1:56:43] in our own way
[1:56:46] when we know that they are not even
[1:56:48] according to the word of God
[1:56:50] foreign step in the wood
[1:56:54] sidestepping the word
[1:56:57] we have limited God
[1:57:01] when we take sanities are too hard for
[1:57:04] the Lord to handle
[1:57:06] and sometimes we look at our lives
[1:57:09] and we say oh I don't think God can
[1:57:12] forgive me this sin you have limited the
[1:57:15] blood of Christ
[1:57:17] to look at something in your life to
[1:57:20] look at the sin in your life and say you
[1:57:22] don't think God can forgive you of this
[1:57:24] sin you have that the power the rest in
[1:57:28] the blood of Christ
[1:57:31] who have limited the blood the power of
[1:57:33] interest in the blood of Christ
[1:57:37] is anything too hard for the Lord there
[1:57:40] are many places in our lives that we can
[1:57:42] set our house and we know
[1:57:45] that we didn't handle the situation
[1:57:47] rightly
[1:57:49] I just want us to talk to God talk to
[1:57:52] God pray
[1:57:54] ask God for his verses his forgiveness
[1:57:58] and ask God to make you a better son to
[1:58:02] make you a better daughter that your
