[50:05] you you may have your
[50:08] [Music]
[50:10] seat I think I try to to change uh the
[50:14] subject but it's the same subject so I
[50:17] just Ted yesterday am I I might just uh
[50:21] uh uh go back and change everything to
[50:24] in the beginning was the word and then
[50:26] let it just be uh different different uh
[50:30] Parts part one part two part three until
[50:33] we can be able to get over it because I
[50:35] realize I might soon run out of path I
[50:37] mean run out of title if I don't keep it
[50:41] that way but this morning we want to go
[50:43] back to our subject that we begin from
[50:46] uh from the beginning of the year in the
[50:48] beginning was the word and I want to do
[50:51] a review I want to throw us back a
[50:53] little bit uh to say that that uh uh we
[50:57] started looking at this subject uh uh uh
[51:01] bringing to our attention that
[51:04] John uh got this uh introduction to his
[51:09] book uh writing his account of the Lord
[51:12] Jesus he got this introduction because
[51:15] he was greatly affected by the things
[51:18] that he saw uh on the island of
[51:21] pmos and uh we know John was in prison
[51:25] we took a portion of that uh uh when we
[51:29] were speaking on uh uh prisoner of love
[51:33] we show how John was he was he was
[51:36] praising on the island of Patmos uh uh
[51:40] for the word of God's sake so he being
[51:44] there for the word of God you have to
[51:46] remember that was that's the time where
[51:48] the church was under persecution so John
[51:51] being there for the word of God uh uh he
[51:54] received this visitation from our lord
[51:57] Jesus praise the Lord thank
[52:00] you thank
[52:04] you thank you sister Grace she's our
[52:07] technician back there so she want to
[52:09] make sure that I have m m
[52:12] uh laser or whatever it
[52:15] is praise the Lord
[52:18] amen I wish I can be comfortable to to
[52:22] preach that way it makes it easy but um
[52:25] I'm still
[52:26] learning now so uh uh
[52:29] John uh uh from from that experience
[52:33] that he had on the on the island of
[52:36] Patmos uh it inspired him to write his
[52:41] report about his his uh his time with
[52:45] Jesus and also he wrote three other
[52:48] episodes that is first John 2 John and
[52:51] third
[52:52] John and then we identify the Revelation
[52:55] chap chapter 3 verse4 was where he took
[52:59] that introduction from when he saw Jesus
[53:02] introducing himself to the Lish Church
[53:05] age which is our age that we are living
[53:08] in the Lord Jesus introducing himself as
[53:11] the amen the faithful and the truth
[53:13] witness and the beginning of the
[53:16] creation of God praise the Lord so John
[53:20] took that and then in St John he opened
[53:25] his writing with in the beginning was
[53:27] the word the word was with God the Word
[53:29] was God he did the same thing when he
[53:31] was writing his his three uh episode to
[53:34] the church he says uh uh that which we
[53:37] have heard from the beginning that which
[53:39] we have seen that which we handle with
[53:41] our hands the word of life we declare
[53:44] unto you now so uh this morning uh uh uh
[53:49] Wednesday night if you if you follow uh
[53:53] uh
[53:53] closely you realize that uh uh we've
[53:58] been we've been going in the in the book
[54:01] of First John that's where we've been
[54:03] traveling because uh uh there was
[54:06] something that I saw if you if you read
[54:08] through the book the entire three
[54:11] episode of John first John 2 John third
[54:14] John you will realize there
[54:17] are Set uh uh uh
[54:23] scriptures you realize uh they are
[54:26] setting uh uh
[54:29] Amma try to see if I can get this
[54:33] thing going in the way that is supposed
[54:36] to or else I
[54:40] will I we ask the technicians to help me
[54:44] uh Grace if you just drop down to the
[54:47] seven references of the
[54:54] beginning
[54:59] no that's that's not okay yeah that that
[55:01] would be that slide so if if you look
[55:04] here you will see that in in John
[55:08] episod he used that same title in the
[55:13] beginning and he speaks seven
[55:17] times of the beginning in in in uh in in
[55:21] uh uh 1 John 1 he said that which was
[55:24] from the beginning
[55:25] we spoke on that and uh uh actually if
[55:30] you read through the entire episode it's
[55:32] more than seven but it's classed into
[55:37] seven because there was seven things
[55:40] that he were addressing I will come back
[55:43] to this there was seven thing that John
[55:45] was addressing but
[55:48] John came to this form of
[55:52] writing because of the impact
[55:56] that the pmos vision had to him had on
[55:59] him praise the Lord on on the island of
[56:03] pmos as Jesus was dealing with John and
[56:07] revealing to John it turned out that
[56:10] John saw a bunch of
[56:14] servants praise the Lord he saw a bunch
[56:18] of servants most of the things that that
[56:21] that the Lord was revealing to him seven
[56:23] Church ages seven golden l seven angels
[56:26] and seven you know uh there were just a
[56:28] bunch of sevens I will show that to you
[56:31] but the reason why uh is because that
[56:36] impacted and a influence John that in
[56:40] all of his writings you will always see
[56:43] a group of
[56:47] sens praise the Lord
[56:50] amen so uh uh let's let's get away from
[56:53] there let's go to our second
[56:55] slide and uh let's let's take the slide
[56:58] by by numbers and that that would be
[57:01] easy for our technician brother BR
[57:03] mentioned the same thing yet in Gabriel
[57:05] Vision he says we find out that there's
[57:08] seven fives in the Plan of Redemption
[57:12] seven fives which mean seven five times
[57:15] in the Plan of Redemption he says five
[57:20] is the number and there's five s Seven
[57:25] Seals seven spirits seven angels seven
[57:28] trumpets seven Church ages so you see
[57:33] the five seven is Grace five is Grace
[57:37] and seven is perfection praise the Lord
[57:42] when we go to our next slide you will
[57:44] see a bunch of servants you will see a
[57:47] bunch of things that John saw while they
[57:51] on the Outland of pmos praise the Lord
[57:54] amen if we just go to our next slide
[57:59] good so you will see here there a bunch
[58:02] of
[58:03] sevenant you realize that uh John spoke
[58:07] about a seven Church ages seven letters
[58:10] seven spirit of God the the Golden Lamb
[58:14] stand seven seven stars in the right
[58:17] hand Seven Seals he talks about seven
[58:20] horn on the Beast he talks about seven
[58:23] eyes he talks about seven angers seven
[58:26] trumpet seven Thunders seven head on the
[58:29] Beast seven Crown seven pledges uh uh uh
[58:34] uh no go
[58:36] back praise the Lord amen
[58:39] amen I don't know whether you did it or
[58:42] I did it
[58:43] sorry seven plagues he talks about Seven
[58:46] Hills he talks about seven Kings and uh
[58:49] in Revelation chapter 7 and then at the
[58:52] last he talks about the seven last
[58:54] vision so you see John saw just just
[58:57] imagine he's going from One Vision to
[59:00] another vision and to another vision and
[59:03] you you should also realize that uh he's
[59:06] a Jewish
[59:07] boy he knows the significant of the
[59:10] number
[59:11] seven praise the
[59:14] Lord amen he knows the significant of
[59:17] the number seven and here is God
[59:20] revealing to him and showing him the
[59:24] vision of the future church and and and
[59:27] and he's seeing all of these
[59:29] sevens praise the
[59:33] Lord there was some the angel
[59:36] interpreted to him the the the seven
[59:39] star in in in the right in my right hand
[59:42] represent the seven messenger the seven
[59:45] golden candlesticks represent the seven
[59:48] churches and he and he saw all of these
[59:53] servants praise the Lord let's go to the
[59:57] next
[59:59] slide now so if you read the Gospel of
[1:00:03] John you will find that that
[1:00:06] John has seven I
[1:00:11] am in John 6:48 he spoke about I am the
[1:00:15] bread of light the bread of life I am
[1:00:18] the light of the word I am the do I am
[1:00:21] the Good Shepherd I am the resurrection
[1:00:23] of the of of life
[1:00:25] I I I am the way the truth and the life
[1:00:27] I am the True
[1:00:29] Vine praise the Lord the next
[1:00:33] Slide John also spoke about seven
[1:00:37] miracles that Jesus
[1:00:40] did which of course at the end of the
[1:00:43] book he said there are many things that
[1:00:46] that Jesus did if if I should write it
[1:00:48] we will not have a book that's right
[1:00:51] praise the Lord but he choose to take
[1:00:56] seven of
[1:00:57] them praise the Lord now the reason why
[1:01:01] I'm I'm bringing this to you before I
[1:01:03] preach is to show you the influence the
[1:01:07] way we are impacted by the things we
[1:01:11] see the things we hear the things that
[1:01:15] been preached to
[1:01:17] us John now coming to write his book
[1:01:21] write his report he's being more
[1:01:25] influenced by The Vision on the island
[1:01:28] of Patmos than his 3 and 1 half years
[1:01:32] with the Lord
[1:01:33] Jesus he walked with the Lord Jesus on
[1:01:36] the shore of gilee he went on Mount
[1:01:39] Olive they Rod the boat together they
[1:01:42] slept together they ate together but
[1:01:44] just this time that John will have on
[1:01:47] the island of pmos have impacted him so
[1:01:53] much praise the
[1:02:01] Lord so he's he he he he he mentioned
[1:02:06] seven miracles or seven signs that that
[1:02:10] happened under Jesus
[1:02:14] ministry and you you'll be you you'll be
[1:02:17] strange enough I mean it will be strange
[1:02:19] enough to let you know the other things
[1:02:22] I I just thought that I should not uh
[1:02:24] spend my whole time uh uh trying to
[1:02:27] gather all of these things but there
[1:02:29] there there are a lot of other things
[1:02:31] that John also also gather praise the
[1:02:36] Lord there were there were other things
[1:02:38] that he also gathered uh I just I just
[1:02:42] kept them in
[1:02:44] my in my own note not to make a slide of
[1:02:48] them he he also gather he uh uh uh the
[1:02:52] five the five feet of of Jesus you you
[1:02:56] you read you read John gospel you will
[1:02:58] see John make mention of uh of uh the
[1:03:02] seventh Feast you know Jesus
[1:03:05] participating in the seventh Feast that
[1:03:07] Moses gave the children of Israel John
[1:03:10] was the only gospel that uh that
[1:03:13] mentioned
[1:03:14] there you see also how 7 times right in
[1:03:20] right in St John chapter 1 seven times
[1:03:23] John spoke about uh the deity of Jesus
[1:03:27] Christ right in St John chapter 1
[1:03:32] amen and uh
[1:03:36] uh but it is
[1:03:42] because the Apostle John was affected by
[1:03:46] all the bunch of different servants that
[1:03:49] he
[1:03:51] sought it changed his life it affected
[1:03:53] him so much
[1:03:54] much so he so he started putting things
[1:03:58] in the context of
[1:04:00] seven when he want to preach he preach
[1:04:02] seven
[1:04:04] series praise the Lord amen I hope I can
[1:04:08] make this seven praise the Lord but I'm
[1:04:11] not John so don't uh don't hold me by it
[1:04:15] amen I'm not John but that that is just
[1:04:18] to give you uh
[1:04:21] H kind of an Insight on what we are
[1:04:23] looking at here so you will see now we
[1:04:27] were we were talking about let's go to
[1:04:29] the next slide we were talking about uh
[1:04:31] the seven references of the beginning
[1:04:34] just like I said if you read first John
[1:04:37] uh uh over to third John uh John put
[1:04:42] this expression of the beginning he put
[1:04:45] it in uh uh uh uh you know in the in in
[1:04:49] the context of using the seven times and
[1:04:52] and that is what that is what what is
[1:04:54] attracting me to this subject that is
[1:04:57] what is attracting me to the subject if
[1:04:59] you remember we spoke on that which was
[1:05:01] from the beginning and uh uh uh last
[1:05:06] Wednesday we spoke on the Commandment
[1:05:09] the old commandment is the word which ye
[1:05:12] have heard from the
[1:05:13] beginning now in uh 1 John chapter 2:3
[1:05:17] which of course we will deal with today
[1:05:19] that's where we will be this morning
[1:05:21] you'll be talking about right onto you
[1:05:24] fathers because ye have known him that
[1:05:27] is from the beginning praise the
[1:05:30] Lord John
[1:05:33] here he's he he's making us to see
[1:05:36] something that's that's what we will get
[1:05:37] into I don't want to go ahead of myself
[1:05:40] but what what John is bringing out here
[1:05:43] let's let's let's let's talk about the
[1:05:45] other ones in uh uh 1 John 2:24 he
[1:05:49] speaks about this he says let that
[1:05:51] therefore abide in you
[1:05:55] which ye have heard from the beginning
[1:05:57] now remember St John chapter 15 Jesus
[1:06:00] said if you abide in me and my word
[1:06:04] abide in you now John was sitting there
[1:06:08] and hearing Jesus saying this it's easy
[1:06:11] to think that this guy just want us to
[1:06:14] do everything he
[1:06:16] says because Jesus is saying if you
[1:06:19] abide in me and my word abide in you but
[1:06:22] after John on the island of pmos he
[1:06:26] realized that the word was not just the
[1:06:30] literal saying of Jesus he realized that
[1:06:34] the world was something completely
[1:06:38] different he realized that Jesus was
[1:06:41] talking about the logos from the
[1:06:45] beginning which of course in St John
[1:06:48] chapter 17 he says that is the glory
[1:06:51] that I have with the father from the
[1:06:53] beginning
[1:06:56] so now he comes back he
[1:06:59] take St John chapter 15 if he abide in
[1:07:03] me and I word abide in you and then he
[1:07:06] comes and teach the church and says let
[1:07:10] that therefore abide in you which ye
[1:07:13] have heard from the beginning that's the
[1:07:14] next one we'll be talking on if uh if
[1:07:16] the Lord if the Lord keep us in the in
[1:07:19] the inspiration then he goes down again
[1:07:21] to 1 John chapter 3 he speaks about the
[1:07:25] devil sinth from the
[1:07:27] beginning praise the Lord so here he's
[1:07:31] taking us now to Genesis chapter
[1:07:34] 3 are we
[1:07:37] together amen now you you the the the
[1:07:41] the importance of this is that John is
[1:07:45] trying to get us rooted
[1:07:49] in everything that we are dealing with
[1:07:51] like brother Bram said he says Genesis
[1:07:54] this is the SE
[1:07:55] chapter everything that we are dealing
[1:07:58] with every spirit that we are dealing
[1:08:00] with all was seed in Genesis all was
[1:08:04] planted in
[1:08:07] Genesis so John is taking us back to the
[1:08:11] beginning if we can be able to Gras it
[1:08:14] from the beginning if we can see it if
[1:08:16] we can understand
[1:08:18] it and then when we are dealing with it
[1:08:20] now it's it's not going to bother us
[1:08:23] that much because we know that that it
[1:08:26] is not just common to
[1:08:30] us praise the
[1:08:33] lord it's not just come to
[1:08:39] us are we
[1:08:41] together so he takes this and says uh
[1:08:46] the devil seen it from the
[1:08:50] beginning for this purpose the son of
[1:08:53] God was
[1:08:54] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:08:57] devil now if you think about that you
[1:09:00] think the Son of God was manifested you
[1:09:02] will only take it to
[1:09:06] Calvary praise the Lord amen you will
[1:09:09] take it to calry but you can see that
[1:09:11] even in the print the the the the the
[1:09:17] the the writers they were very they were
[1:09:21] very very purposefully to make us for
[1:09:24] this to grab our attention because in
[1:09:27] every age God manifested a
[1:09:32] son praise the Lord when Samson came on
[1:09:36] the scene he was a manifestation of a
[1:09:39] son to do what destroy the works of the
[1:09:43] Philistine Goliath was intimidating
[1:09:46] Israel when David came on the scene it
[1:09:49] was a manifestation of a son to shut
[1:09:53] that mouth of a Goliath and you are here
[1:09:56] as a manifestation of sons and
[1:10:00] daughters hallu to be able to stum on
[1:10:03] the work of the devil in this age once
[1:10:06] again God is going to prove that he have
[1:10:09] a
[1:10:10] people praise the Lord
[1:10:14] amen so it's not something oh the Son of
[1:10:17] God was manifested and we we just make
[1:10:19] it only a a manifestation of calvary
[1:10:26] praise the Lord amen so you see he's
[1:10:29] he's showing us in the
[1:10:32] beginning that When sin came in God rose
[1:10:35] up a
[1:10:37] standard amen the Bible says Seth was
[1:10:41] born and man begin to call upon the name
[1:10:44] of the
[1:10:45] Lord the generation of Noah there was
[1:10:49] evil but yet God found favor in the man
[1:10:52] Noah and he was a Son of God that
[1:10:55] destroyed the works of the Devil by
[1:10:58] following God commandment building a
[1:11:01] boat that seal him through the
[1:11:08] Judgment are we
[1:11:12] together so the reason why God called us
[1:11:15] is not to play
[1:11:16] church we have a work to do to destroy
[1:11:20] the works of the devil amen
[1:11:26] are we
[1:11:29] together then John comes down again
[1:11:32] right here he says I love this one 2
[1:11:36] John 21:5 he
[1:11:38] says and now I beset the lady if you go
[1:11:43] back and read verse one he spoke to the
[1:11:45] church as the elected lady so John after
[1:11:50] his experience on the island of pmos he
[1:11:53] realized that the bride was represented
[1:11:56] in
[1:11:57] Eden if Adam had a bride definitely the
[1:12:01] church is the bride of
[1:12:05] Christ praise the Lord so now he's
[1:12:08] speaking to the bride here I Bes such
[1:12:11] the lady a new
[1:12:13] commandment which we have from the
[1:12:15] beginning that we love one another I
[1:12:17] love that one amen praise the Lord I
[1:12:21] love that one
[1:12:24] when we get there you'll see why I love
[1:12:26] it I love that one praise the Lord and
[1:12:30] then in the in the last
[1:12:33] one this is the
[1:12:36] Commandment which ye have heard from the
[1:12:41] beginning walk I mean you should walk in
[1:12:44] it it almost sounds like the first one
[1:12:48] praise the Lord but it have a little it
[1:12:50] have a little different context so so
[1:12:54] that's uh that's the seven
[1:12:56] reference I was uh uh I I try to take
[1:13:00] time to work on that just to be able to
[1:13:02] give you a picture just to be able to
[1:13:05] give you a picture of how can can you
[1:13:09] imagine how do you think Noah managed to
[1:13:14] preach one message for 20
[1:13:19] years how you think he did
[1:13:22] it is the impact of the
[1:13:25] vision when you are impacted by a vision
[1:13:29] you don't change your mind nothing
[1:13:32] change the vision that God revealed to
[1:13:35] him about building that boat impressed
[1:13:38] him so much that every time he goes to
[1:13:42] lay a little wood it look more beautiful
[1:13:45] wow wow that's why he made when he said
[1:13:48] six Cubit that's why he glory to
[1:13:52] God
[1:13:57] praise the
[1:13:58] Lord the reason why this book looks
[1:14:03] boring to us because it have not
[1:14:05] impacted you yet that's right it have
[1:14:09] not impacted you if this B hit your life
[1:14:13] yes sir when you wake up in the morning
[1:14:15] that's the first thing you will look
[1:14:21] for how can a man preach a message for
[1:14:24] 120
[1:14:28] years
[1:14:31] Hallelujah the impact of
[1:14:40] vision praise the
[1:14:43] Lord just like the our lord Jesus
[1:14:46] ministry many people came they were
[1:14:47] drove by the miracle some came for the
[1:14:49] food and some came for different thing
[1:14:52] they have happened in every
[1:14:53] age most of the people that left Moses
[1:14:56] they left because well that the see
[1:14:59] death is coming I don't want my first
[1:15:00] born to die I might let me jump behind
[1:15:02] this guy but never got a revelation
[1:15:05] that's the reason why the god in the
[1:15:07] wilderness they started stomping and
[1:15:08] that man fing at him and every one of
[1:15:10] and all of
[1:15:13] that and that's the same all of these
[1:15:16] people that are jumping out of the
[1:15:18] message don't want to serve God anymore
[1:15:21] they were just following the crowd
[1:15:24] the word never imparted
[1:15:29] them oh let that Asian word impart am
[1:15:34] let that Asian word
[1:15:36] impart your life will never be the same
[1:15:40] right let that anient word
[1:15:46] impart John was so imparted by the
[1:15:49] vision that everything he saw he saw
[1:15:52] seven
[1:15:55] praise the
[1:15:56] Lord amen John John had a cross eye to
[1:16:00] see
[1:16:02] seven everything he saw he had to take a
[1:16:05] seven out of
[1:16:07] it because he was so
[1:16:10] imparted by the
[1:16:14] vision praise the
[1:16:21] Lord so we want to we want to go I take

[1:20:20] fathers and uh and and in Father's
[1:20:24] year as as we soon see it is is is
[1:20:29] actually going to address
[1:20:32] parenting and that's and that's word I'm
[1:20:35] I'm uh I'm I'm uh inspired to speak on
[1:20:40] this
[1:20:41] morning it's actually going to address
[1:20:44] parenting why because God our father he
[1:20:48] was the first
[1:20:51] parent parent who begin in
[1:20:55] Him Praise the Lord so when we talk
[1:20:58] about fathers here I want us to be able
[1:21:01] to see it in that context and not only
[1:21:03] look at the
[1:21:04] male but look at
[1:21:08] parenting praise the Lord because the
[1:21:11] beginning of the childhood starts from
[1:21:17] parenting glory be to God and it takes
[1:21:20] both the father and the mother country
[1:21:23] contribution some has been given special
[1:21:26] Grace are we together so that's that's
[1:21:30] why I want for us to keep our mind on
[1:21:33] this
[1:21:34] morning now write unto you fathers
[1:21:38] because ye have known
[1:21:40] him that is from the
[1:21:43] beginning I write unto you young
[1:21:48] men because ye have overcome the weak
[1:21:53] one then he he take the phrase again he
[1:21:57] says I write unto you little children
[1:22:01] because ye have known the
[1:22:05] father I I have written unto you fathers
[1:22:09] because ye have known him that is from
[1:22:12] the
[1:22:14] beginning I I have written unto you
[1:22:16] young men because ye are
[1:22:20] strong and the word
[1:22:23] word of God Abarth in you and ye have
[1:22:28] overcome the wicked one praise the Lord
[1:22:33] am amen glory be to God now so H uh uh
[1:22:40] uh we want to look at that this morning
[1:22:42] write unto you fathers because you have
[1:22:45] known him from the beginning just like I
[1:22:47] said I want to drive in the area of
[1:22:49] parenting this morning because the word
[1:22:52] is our
[1:22:54] parent this word it give birth to
[1:22:58] you praise the lord it's the word that
[1:23:01] create created your physical universe
[1:23:05] and if you are born again you are born
[1:23:07] again by the Sea Incorruptible which is
[1:23:10] the word of God so the word is your
[1:23:15] parent that parent from the beginning
[1:23:17] was the
[1:23:20] word are you grapping the picture
[1:23:23] yes praise the Lord conflict between God
[1:23:26] and Satan let's take the next
[1:23:28] slide yeah now God is the infinite God
[1:23:33] and the infinite God is the Perfection
[1:23:35] of
[1:23:37] perfection he knew all things before
[1:23:40] they ever was and therefore if this
[1:23:42] infinite God could have looked forward
[1:23:45] and did and seen the end from the
[1:23:48] beginning and knew that he who have
[1:23:52] children
[1:23:53] on this Earth his own blessed children
[1:23:57] don't you believe that he will provide
[1:24:00] for them the best that he could provide
[1:24:03] now you have to realize the reason why
[1:24:06] he left being an internal Spirit was to
[1:24:09] manifest himself to his
[1:24:12] attributes to bring forth his attributes
[1:24:14] and we were part of his
[1:24:18] attributes praise praise the Lord so
[1:24:22] look down time he knew that we will be
[1:24:24] here amen praise
[1:24:27] God and like any parent will
[1:24:30] do remember I'm saying is that he will
[1:24:33] surely provide the best thing for
[1:24:37] them amen and what was the best thing we
[1:24:41] spoke about that Wednesday night the
[1:24:43] best thing that God could give his
[1:24:47] children was his
[1:24:51] word
[1:24:53] amen was his word the best thing that he
[1:24:56] could give them was himself the word
[1:25:01] yes to be their provider to be their Pro
[1:25:06] protector for them to be able to enjoy
[1:25:10] his
[1:25:14] existence are we
[1:25:17] together will not you tonight to your
[1:25:21] children
[1:25:23] that was uh helpless little fellows who
[1:25:25] can't take care of themselves don't you
[1:25:27] struggle and work and do everything that
[1:25:30] you can to provide the best that you can
[1:25:33] or able to provide for those
[1:25:36] children because you are a father a
[1:25:41] parent and if that's been what I who say
[1:25:46] the
[1:25:47] truthness and the thought of an Earthly
[1:25:51] parent
[1:25:52] and
[1:25:53] Parenthood
[1:25:55] originated in
[1:25:58] God because he was their first
[1:26:05] parent praise the Lord he was the first
[1:26:11] parent and when he say let us make man
[1:26:14] he says let us make man in our image
[1:26:17] male and
[1:26:21] female
[1:26:24] and God make man M and
[1:26:28] female he was the first
[1:26:30] parent are we
[1:26:34] together and don't you think that God
[1:26:37] seeing what Satan will be what Satan
[1:26:39] will do he gave to his
[1:26:42] children and provided for them the best
[1:26:45] thing that could be provided for them
[1:26:47] knowing what the enemy attack would be
[1:26:50] God fortified
[1:26:54] his
[1:26:56] children praise the
[1:26:58] Lord he gave them his word we look at 39
[1:27:02] words on uh on uh uh Wednesday night
[1:27:05] that he put them
[1:27:07] behind praise the Lord you have to
[1:27:10] realize to Adam that was not a
[1:27:13] commandment to Adam that was the word of
[1:27:17] God praise the Lord to Adam it was not
[1:27:21] like do or don't
[1:27:25] no he saw it as God's
[1:27:30] protection praise the
[1:27:32] Lord no matter what you
[1:27:36] know that thou shall not Ste
[1:27:39] means no matter what you know whatever
[1:27:42] you have understand that thou shall not
[1:27:45] steal
[1:27:46] means to God is more than
[1:27:51] that
[1:27:53] praise the Lord no matter what you know
[1:27:56] what explanation you can give to thou
[1:27:59] shal not
[1:28:01] lie well no matter what explanation you
[1:28:04] can
[1:28:05] give to you it will just be a regulation
[1:28:11] something you can do if you if I do it
[1:28:14] okay this will happen if I don't do it
[1:28:15] this will to you that's what it means to
[1:28:18] God is more than
[1:28:21] that
[1:28:23] amen it's more than that just telling a
[1:28:26] lie is more than that why because to him
[1:28:31] he's the spirit of truth it's not traced
[1:28:34] back to him it's not his
[1:28:38] nature praise the lord it's not part of
[1:28:41] his
[1:28:45] economy while you and myself just look
[1:28:48] at it as said do or done God look at it
[1:28:52] more than that that's the reason why
[1:28:54] Jesus when he came he could say in the
[1:28:56] Lord it was telling you thou shall not
[1:28:58] commit adultery but I say unto you right
[1:29:02] that if you look at a woman and lost
[1:29:05] after her so Jesus was trying to say to
[1:29:08] you the Lord was given and to your
[1:29:11] understanding it limited you but to me
[1:29:14] almighty God I look wider and deeper
[1:29:17] than than than what your mind
[1:29:20] think
[1:29:22] thou shall
[1:29:24] not kill thy brother but he that hated
[1:29:27] his brother without a curse yes sir God
[1:29:30] says it runs deep he says to me my word
[1:29:35] runs
[1:29:43] deep are we
[1:29:49] together so you see it in
[1:29:52] parenting the success is never rules and
[1:30:01] regulation so the Commandment in the
[1:30:03] beginning we read that in
[1:30:07] Genesis i' like to go back and and and
[1:30:10] give you a review but before I finish
[1:30:12] reviewing my time will be off praise the
[1:30:15] Lord
[1:30:18] amen
[1:30:20] John spoke there we we saw it the
[1:30:24] Commandment from the beginning he says
[1:30:25] uh the old commandment from the
[1:30:27] beginning a new commandment I gave you
[1:30:29] is not a new commandment is the same old
[1:30:30] commandment from the
[1:30:33] beginning and we look there in Genesis
[1:30:35] chapter 2 where we saw that uh uh H uh
[1:30:39] and God commanded Adam of every tree of
[1:30:43] the garden you will
[1:30:46] eat first time that word will come up in
[1:30:49] the
[1:30:50] scripture command
[1:30:54] it but what I'm what I'm trying to show
[1:30:57] you here is
[1:31:00] that it was never taken as a commandment
[1:31:03] because God don't give commandment to
[1:31:07] his
[1:31:08] children like the way we
[1:31:11] think Exodus chapter 19 when God brought
[1:31:15] up brought out the children of Israel he
[1:31:17] never gave them a
[1:31:20] commandment the law was not gave to them
[1:31:22] they requested for the
[1:31:24] Lord they are the one that told God all
[1:31:27] that the Lord God said we will do God
[1:31:30] said
[1:31:32] really
[1:31:36] really okay Moses come up here yeah come
[1:31:40] come come up
[1:31:41] here
[1:31:44] really are these people telling me that
[1:31:46] everything I said they would
[1:31:50] do praise the Lord
[1:31:52] this finite mind these people that are
[1:31:54] with limited
[1:31:56] conscience right these people that
[1:31:58] cannot see past their nose they are the
[1:32:00] one telling me that everything I said
[1:32:03] they would do okay come up here
[1:32:05] come come I gave you two
[1:32:09] stones praise the Lord two stones it's
[1:32:12] it's very beautiful when you look at it
[1:32:15] uh uh you know we were reading through
[1:32:16] the Bible there and and uh I was kind of
[1:32:20] showing the case there
[1:32:22] how God will gave the Egyptians 10
[1:32:25] plagues and gave his people 10
[1:32:32] commandments praise the
[1:32:34] Lord I don't want to go into there let's
[1:32:37] let's stay right here so you see the the
[1:32:40] word was never it was never God
[1:32:43] intention to give his children laws
[1:32:46] because you don't parent with
[1:32:49] laws laws don't parent
[1:32:52] right yeah laws don't
[1:32:55] parent whenever laws start coming out
[1:32:59] that's when Rebellion
[1:33:04] starts praise the
[1:33:07] Lord are we
[1:33:10] together so for the very fact that the
[1:33:12] people who says all that God says we
[1:33:15] will do it was a sense of rebellion
[1:33:18] brother brandham says they despise Grace
[1:33:21] and the ask God for Lord he says that
[1:33:23] was the most the most fatal mistake that
[1:33:26] Israel ever made right to stand before
[1:33:29] allmighty God and say I can keep your
[1:33:32] word you see me I'm a Believer I can
[1:33:35] keep your word
[1:33:44] liar are we together
[1:33:49] amen the principle of
[1:33:53] parenting can never be established by
[1:33:58] laws laws are to govern Rebellion
[1:34:03] people the reason why we have law
[1:34:05] because we are living in a lawless
[1:34:07] country right if there was no stopway
[1:34:10] sound here we would be hearing cars
[1:34:12] knocking themselves on that Junction
[1:34:15] there just
[1:34:17] now because everybody is in the hurry
[1:34:20] everybody is in the Hur
[1:34:27] are we together amen parent who
[1:34:30] originated in God because he was the
[1:34:33] first
[1:34:35] parent are we together
[1:34:42] amen and I'll take this one
[1:34:44] also okay still doing well all of my
[1:34:47] time trying not to keep you long
[1:34:49] identify masterpiece
[1:34:52] he says now if anybody had has
[1:34:55] something that you wanted to do real
[1:34:58] nice I will much rather you do it to my
[1:35:02] children than to than to do it to
[1:35:06] me and so I feel maybe as a
[1:35:11] parent and he is the source of
[1:35:16] Parenthood now he's bringing this
[1:35:18] thought of how God want us to treat his
[1:35:23] children while he said one word spoken
[1:35:26] against the church will not be forgiven
[1:35:29] he's bringing that thought along to make
[1:35:31] us to understand that just in the
[1:35:33] natural as a natural parent will
[1:35:36] feel the sense of feeling that you will
[1:35:39] have when you know that someone has been
[1:35:41] kind to your child he says that is the
[1:35:44] same way the almighty God that sense of
[1:35:47] feeling comes from God right
[1:35:52] praise the
[1:35:53] Lord that sense of feeling comes from
[1:35:56] God can you imagine what almighty God
[1:35:59] fell when his first daughter was abused
[1:36:03] by the
[1:36:05] serpent praise the Lord do you do you
[1:36:09] think that it was a joyful thing for the
[1:36:14] Creator when he could stop
[1:36:18] it praise the
[1:36:20] Lord
[1:36:23] when he could stop
[1:36:28] it you see that's that's another thing
[1:36:31] about
[1:36:33] parenting God allow it because he was
[1:36:36] bringing his children to be
[1:36:40] partaker they were part they were
[1:36:43] part of his
[1:36:45] inheritance they were part of his work
[1:36:48] of
[1:36:50] redemption
[1:36:52] so even though he could stop it yet he
[1:36:54] stood
[1:37:01] back praise the
[1:37:05] Lord showing how in parenting he include
[1:37:09] his
[1:37:11] children he include them right after he
[1:37:15] made everything he said Adam you need
[1:37:20] it you go ahead and name it what what
[1:37:23] should I call it I don't know you name
[1:37:26] it he says I'll say lying he said that
[1:37:28] just what I was thinking about right I
[1:37:32] call this one line beautiful beautiful
[1:37:34] son
[1:37:39] beautiful that's what Jesus teaching the
[1:37:42] Lord's Prayer he says when you prayed
[1:37:45] When you pray every time you get on your
[1:37:48] knees to
[1:37:50] pray take yourself back to your
[1:37:54] beginning goes back to your beginning
[1:37:57] you are not standing before a judge you
[1:37:59] not standing before a god that is ready
[1:38:01] to whip you that's what John is all
[1:38:04] about in this book for us to be able to
[1:38:07] trace ourself back because if you don't
[1:38:10] do it you will just be caught up in
[1:38:11] religion and you will never get into
[1:38:14] True Fellowship with God sir because you
[1:38:16] will be limited by the
[1:38:20] church yes
[1:38:24] sir he says whenever you pray says our
[1:38:31] father my
[1:38:37] father the one from whom I began
[1:38:44] yes oh it is true it's a recitation to
[1:38:48] many of us so it's hard to connect with
[1:38:50] it
[1:38:52] but just keep reciting it keep reing it
[1:38:56] it become real to
[1:38:58] you just keep reciting it fall in love
[1:39:02] with the Lord's Prayer amen amen praise
[1:39:06] the
[1:39:09] Lord I took I take it as a secret home
[1:39:13] we say the Lord's Prayer every morning
[1:39:16] after we
[1:39:19] pray because there is something that I
[1:39:21] come to know about
[1:39:23] it that have changed my
[1:39:26] life many years
[1:39:33] ago he is the source of
[1:39:37] Parenthood I think
[1:39:40] that that's the way God
[1:39:45] feels if we should we we serve him as we
[1:39:50] serve each
[1:39:55] other we serve him as we serve each
[1:39:59] other the devil is the most selfish
[1:40:03] beast on Earth it's all about him and
[1:40:08] him
[1:40:10] alone how much he can kill how much he
[1:40:13] can
[1:40:14] destroy right it's all about
[1:40:18] him but with God it's him in his
[1:40:23] attributes praise the Lord
[1:40:26] amen man I mean I mean such a Spain here
[1:40:29] right now I'm feeling so
[1:40:32] good I'm feeling so good and the reason
[1:40:36] is because I'm lifting up the Parenthood
[1:40:38] of my
[1:40:43] father that's your
[1:40:45] beginning that's your beginning you can
[1:40:48] trace yourself back to your village
[1:40:50] Trace yourself back to but that's that's
[1:40:52] the beginning of the
[1:41:02] universe praise the
[1:41:05] Lord I hope I won't keep you too long
[1:41:08] let's take one more quat and then we can
[1:41:10] start preaching I have not started
[1:41:16] yet
[1:41:19] amen
[1:41:22] my tongue almost roll in my
[1:41:25] mouth and I bite
[1:41:28] it Ephesian parallel
[1:41:35] Joshua glory be to
[1:41:43] God now he's Jehovah Jehovah
[1:41:48] means the one who exists with his
[1:41:54] family there he is god
[1:41:58] Jehovah the one who once existed in self
[1:42:02] existence but now now so you see when
[1:42:05] you go back to Genesis 1 and you take
[1:42:08] that
[1:42:11] word h uh
[1:42:15] uh let me let me go back
[1:42:19] there
[1:42:21] I thought I was going to do some a kind
[1:42:23] of a layout for for for us this morning
[1:42:26] to be able to to to expressed there
[1:42:29] Genesis Genesis 1:26 and God said let us
[1:42:35] make men now the reason why that has
[1:42:38] become h h h a subject of contradiction
[1:42:42] all through the word is because Thy word
[1:42:47] God is
[1:42:49] Elohim
[1:42:51] that word that is used there in the
[1:42:54] Hebrew is Elohim and Elohim the word
[1:42:59] Elohim the the spelling
[1:43:01] Elohim that spelling e l o m r no h i Am
[1:43:07] is that right am I spelling it right
[1:43:10] okay if I'm wrong say you are
[1:43:13] wrong that spelling is in the plural yes
[1:43:19] sir it's in the plural let let me let me
[1:43:22] also show you something that if if you
[1:43:25] look at closely you look in the Bible
[1:43:28] you will see that
[1:43:32] uh when you talk about one
[1:43:36] cherub cherubin if you talk about one
[1:43:39] it's a
[1:43:41] cherub if they are more than one they
[1:43:44] are cherubin but without s that's right
[1:43:47] okay that's right it's a PR
[1:43:54] form so the same way yeah
[1:43:59] God meanings Elohim going back to his
[1:44:05] state of being
[1:44:08] self-existence dwelling with all his
[1:44:11] attribute
[1:44:13] God so the context was not wrong when he
[1:44:16] says let us right amen right
[1:44:22] are you seeing the picture
[1:44:24] sir because if you want to be if you
[1:44:27] want to teach me English then explain
[1:44:30] this to me put up Genesis 1:26 for
[1:44:37] me praise the Lord you know you know you
[1:44:39] will beat me you know you will beat me
[1:44:42] so if I'm if I'm calling you to this
[1:44:44] play you must know I really did my
[1:44:47] homework because on any grammar you're
[1:44:49] going to beat me praise the Lord but
[1:44:53] watch this the Bible says and God which
[1:44:57] of course this God is what is Elohim in
[1:45:01] the
[1:45:02] Hebrew said let us make man in our image
[1:45:07] and after our likeness and let them have
[1:45:11] dominion over the fishes of the seed
[1:45:13] okay go to 27 27 is where where
[1:45:17] my and God Elohim
[1:45:21] created man in his now if he said let us
[1:45:26] then why it is his
[1:45:35] year no it's supposed to be so God
[1:45:38] created man in our
[1:45:45] image amen are you seeing the picture
[1:45:48] amen praise the Lord now the the reason
[1:45:51] why I I said that is because when you
[1:45:54] read Genesis you will see that uh uh uh
[1:45:59] word God and Lord is
[1:46:03] used it brings
[1:46:05] out uh uh uh uh the the the attributes
[1:46:09] of
[1:46:10] God Amen because in Genesis chapter two
[1:46:15] you'll find that uh uh uh the Lord God
[1:46:18] commanded man you hear there in Genesis
[1:46:21] 2 that Genesis 2:16 the Lord God
[1:46:23] commanded man now is no longer God is is
[1:46:27] is the Lord
[1:46:32] God praise the Lord now which bring us
[1:46:36] to what we were reading here that's the
[1:46:37] reason why I went into all of that that
[1:46:40] places for you let's go back to Ephesian
[1:46:43] parallel Joshua here I can be able to
[1:46:45] express some few things to you and then
[1:46:47] we
[1:46:48] close and now he is Jehovah Jehovah
[1:46:52] meaning the one who exists with his
[1:46:55] family there he is God Jehova the one
[1:46:59] who
[1:47:01] once existed in self-existence but now
[1:47:05] exist with his
[1:47:08] family and his little ones with
[1:47:12] him praise the
[1:47:14] Lord God
[1:47:19] condescending the great Elohim
[1:47:22] condescending and he's breaking out
[1:47:24] himself taking his attributes from from
[1:47:27] from in him expressing it and it's also
[1:47:30] going to the word so God's mind of
[1:47:36] creation and
[1:47:39] Redemption praise the
[1:47:41] Lord God's mind of creation and
[1:47:44] Redemption because you realize that
[1:47:46] those are the two things that God used
[1:47:49] to speak to people
[1:47:52] people all the people that don't believe
[1:47:55] in his his Redemptive
[1:48:00] work they somehow believe in his
[1:48:05] creation praise the Lord Paul brought
[1:48:08] that out beautiful in Romans chapter 1
[1:48:11] you know what he
[1:48:13] said he said because they refuse to
[1:48:16] acknowledge Him as God when they
[1:48:19] invisible
[1:48:21] things declare that he
[1:48:24] exists when man can go on the moon and
[1:48:27] the stars and and they can look at the
[1:48:29] gaces and all of that all of those
[1:48:31] things you don't have to read the Bible
[1:48:34] if you don't want her what is written in
[1:48:37] the Bible here is only about
[1:48:43] Redemption the story of redemption is
[1:48:46] right
[1:48:48] here the story of of creation is all
[1:48:51] around
[1:48:52] you it's all around
[1:48:55] you praise the
[1:48:58] Lord so Paul says in Romans chapter 1
[1:49:02] because man has refused to acknowledge
[1:49:06] God that's the reason why he turned them
[1:49:09] over to a rebellious
[1:49:12] spirit for them to misuse their own
[1:49:15] body when men deny you want to enjoy
[1:49:21] the the the the creation and deny the
[1:49:26] Creator Paul says that's the reason why
[1:49:30] God has turned them over to all the
[1:49:32] filed Spirit man with men and women with
[1:49:35] women and all of
[1:49:37] that it's a it's it's a it's a it's it's
[1:49:41] a national curse it's a it's it's it's
[1:49:44] is it's an abominable curse to the
[1:49:47] Earth the same way when man did not
[1:49:50] acknowledge God in the days of Noah he
[1:49:53] he he sent a FL and WEP out the the the
[1:49:56] the the whole existence of man that is
[1:49:58] the same thing he's doing this time it's
[1:50:00] not a flood it's a
[1:50:02] spirit it's a Gil lesbian and all sorts
[1:50:05] of filthy spirit that is just roing the
[1:50:07] mind of man they turning himself to
[1:50:09] beast and I mean all sorts of things
[1:50:11] they are doing with them is when man do
[1:50:14] not acknowledge their
[1:50:18] creator Hallelujah
[1:50:20] when
[1:50:21] Nebuchadnezzar did not acknowledge that
[1:50:24] the power that brought Israel on him was
[1:50:27] all Mighty God God turned him to a beast
[1:50:30] seven years he ate grass like a
[1:50:37] beast praise the Lord forget about
[1:50:40] Redemption you'll forget about
[1:50:41] Redemption for the fact that you are
[1:50:45] alive you are
[1:50:48] alive there is a God that give you birth
[1:50:51] am amen amen you forget about I'm not
[1:50:54] forcing you to church you don't have to
[1:50:56] come to church you don't have to serve
[1:50:58] God because you can't serve him until he
[1:51:00] call
[1:51:01] you that's the five with Redemption I'm
[1:51:03] talking about your
[1:51:07] existence and God says if you fail to
[1:51:10] acknowledge that he will make you to
[1:51:13] turn against your own
[1:51:18] nature you will do the very things that
[1:51:21] don't make sense to you that's why you
[1:51:22] will do to your own
[1:51:27] body when man does not acknowledge God
[1:51:30] as a
[1:51:32] Creator praise the Lord oh I'm so glad
[1:51:35] we can acknowledge Him as our creator we
[1:51:37] can acknowledge Him as Our Redeemer we
[1:51:39] can acknowledge Him as our
[1:51:44] savior the Bible says the heaven declare
[1:51:48] the glory of God
[1:51:51] the farmer man speaks of his hand
[1:51:54] work praise the Lord why because they
[1:51:59] are his
[1:52:01] creation they appreciate appreciate
[1:52:04] being created so they have to express it
[1:52:07] you don't appreciate Redemption that's
[1:52:09] why you want us to beg you to come to
[1:52:11] church we must beg you to come to church
[1:52:13] brother you need to be in church sister
[1:52:15] please you need to serve God you don't
[1:52:17] appreciate
[1:52:18] Redemption
[1:52:21] my if you appreciate Redemption and you
[1:52:24] know what it took on
[1:52:27] Calvary to pay the depts that you
[1:52:30] couldn't have
[1:52:31] paid praise the Lord you won't wait for
[1:52:34] the doors to be open that's what the
[1:52:36] prophet
[1:52:41] said
[1:52:44] parenting
[1:52:47] God when uh uh uh John can't can you
[1:52:51] imagine John de Revelation chapter 5 no
[1:52:56] man is worthy to open the book John wept
[1:53:00] he
[1:53:01] cried glory be to God but when one of
[1:53:05] the elds came and said John why are you
[1:53:08] weeping what are you weeping the lion of
[1:53:11] the Trap of Judah has
[1:53:14] prevailed praise the Lord John trying to
[1:53:17] WP his eyes and look around to see where
[1:53:20] the lion is he saw a larm the Bible says
[1:53:23] he
[1:53:25] shouted he shouted his Str he says all
[1:53:29] them in in the in in the heavens he me

[1:53:44] Lord

[1:53:54] Redemption
[1:53:56] amen he could trace himself
[1:53:59] back to the lamb in the
[1:54:02] beginning so it's very important it's
[1:54:05] very very important to John right here

[1:54:11] to tell you says that's where your

[1:54:33] together amen so John with everything
[1:54:36] that he saw on the island of pmos this
[1:54:38] whole thing about the beginning of the
[1:54:40] creation of God just got his mind he
[1:54:43] says oh my God that's where this whole

[1:54:50] called the uh uh the gospel I breaking

[1:54:56] and he says that's what is coming from
[1:54:58] it's coming from the
[1:55:00] beginning if we can go back to the
[1:55:03] beginning amen praise the
[1:55:05] Lord if we can go back to the
[1:55:10] beginning hallelujah

[1:55:28] about you know when the child is born
[1:55:30] and died you know to go right to Heaven
[1:55:32] John was making us to understand that he

[1:57:25] that's that was the thing that grabbed
[1:57:26] my
[1:57:27] attention that John is addressing more
[1:57:31] than just a father
[1:57:34] year he's he's addressing a state of
[1:57:38] being he's addressing
[1:57:43] Parenthood glory be to God amen
[1:57:47] amen and as I thought about
[1:57:50] that I thought
[1:57:53] about the effect of our
[1:57:58] society and I will say that and I will
[1:58:00] say it to every one of
[1:58:02] us we are we are in such a Time living
[1:58:05] in such a
[1:58:07] Time
[1:58:09] word you know you try to look at these
[1:58:12] words sometimes they don't give you what
[1:58:15] what is in the depth of your mind but I
[1:58:18] was trying to look at
[1:58:20] the difference between training and
[1:58:23] education you look at education it tells
[1:58:26] you it's a form of training but there is
[1:58:28] one word that's that stuck out to me it
[1:58:31] says
[1:58:35] intellectual praise the Lord amen
[1:58:39] amen the one word that stuck out to me
[1:58:41] is said intellectual and uh uh but I
[1:58:44] believe there is there is a difference I
[1:58:47] believe that uh uh as as parent uh uh
[1:58:51] the the role of parenting is our
[1:58:54] responsibility to train our children by
[1:58:56] the word of God that's what the word of
[1:58:59] God says train up a child we all know
[1:59:01] that we can say that uh at the back of
[1:59:04] our head proverb 22:6 that is our
[1:59:08] god-given
[1:59:10] responsibility to train our
[1:59:12] children but you see we are in such a
[1:59:17] culture that is Twisted things around
[1:59:20] that's right and that's why we having
[1:59:23] the kind of a problem that we having
[1:59:25] with the
[1:59:26] generation because the generation is
[1:59:28] left to the society to train them they
[1:59:33] are supposed to go to school to have
[1:59:35] some intellectual ability to read and
[1:59:38] write and be able to reason but when it
[1:59:42] comes to
[1:59:43] training is almost the difference
[1:59:46] between discipline and Punishment M
[1:59:49] right yeah praise the Lord you don't
[1:59:51] send you don't allow your child to go to
[1:59:53] praison to be disciplined there is no
[1:59:55] discipline in praising in praising is
[1:59:58] punishment
[2:00:01] right right praise the
[2:00:04] Lord in in praising is punishment they
[2:00:07] don't eat the food they want to eat they
[2:00:09] don't wear the clothes they want to wear
[2:00:10] it they having time for it's it's
[2:00:14] punishment praising don't
[2:00:17] discipline but you see when when when we
[2:00:20] lose our ability or the grace or even
[2:00:25] the children
[2:00:26] despising The Godly discipline that is
[2:00:29] given to them then God ordered the
[2:00:33] state to take over from
[2:00:39] them there is just there is just a Twist
[2:00:43] the whole thing that's that's the that's
[2:00:44] what this generation all over the world
[2:00:48] that's that's what the the generation is
[2:00:50] dealing
[2:00:54] with why
[2:00:58] because that
[2:01:00] Parenthood that sacred virtue from
[2:01:04] God that he that he instored in Us in
[2:01:08] bringing for life to the Earth we have
[2:01:11] despised
[2:01:15] it we have despised
[2:01:18] it and we just think that well if we can
[2:01:20] get them into into NY let's send them to
[2:01:23] n NY 2 three years okay let them go 4
[2:01:25] hours they come back and and as long as
[2:01:28] they go you know what what you learn in
[2:01:30] school to the ABC oh yeah the child know
[2:01:31] how to say they ABC and and all of that
[2:01:33] and but you realize that uh all of the
[2:01:37] time from from that age of six years
[2:01:41] until they will be facing their
[2:01:44] future they will be in the hands of
[2:01:47] someone that will be playing with their
[2:01:49] mind

[2:11:11] closely that this Society this
[2:11:14] generation we are in the loss of the
[2:11:17] land is not in our favor right

[2:11:38] favor are we together
[2:11:47] amen
[2:11:49] and when you go over to the Book of
[2:11:50] Joshua Joshua chapter
[2:11:55] 4:6 there are a lot of things I wanted
[2:11:57] to go into this morning I'm just trying
[2:11:58] to pull myself out a little bit because
[2:12:01] I'm out of time here you go to
[2:12:04] Joshua
[2:12:07] 4:6 you will also find this Moses in
[2:12:11] Deuteronomy he says teach your children
[2:12:14] Joshua when they go to the promised land
[2:12:16] Joshua says when your children shall ask
[2:12:20] you what is the meaning of
[2:12:24] this this is what you should say to
[2:12:28] them when your children shall ask
[2:12:34] you amen
[2:12:42] amen when we talk about when Jude talk
[2:12:46] about let us ear earnestly concerned for
[2:12:49] the faith if there is one book that
[2:12:53] describ
[2:12:56] apostasy one chapter book in the
[2:13:00] Bible that describe apostasy is the Book
[2:13:04] of Job Jude when Jude says let's contend
[2:13:09] for the faith that was delivered unto us
[2:13:12] he knew what he was talking
[2:13:16] about amen
[2:13:19] Jude went into describing the spirit of
[2:13:23] apostasy until he brought it so much
[2:13:26] down of how much the body of Moses was
[2:13:29] fought
[2:13:33] over when Moses
[2:13:35] died you think about
[2:13:39] that if his dead body was fought over
[2:13:42] what's about your living
[2:13:46] body every day and
[2:13:51] night there are demons Waring against
[2:13:54] Angels over your body over the decision
[2:13:58] you will make over the next ACT that you
[2:14:01] will
[2:14:03] perform living in an age where the
[2:14:06] spirit of apostasy is on the
[2:14:12] people and whatever the devil will use
[2:14:15] to play
[2:14:16] Down the standard of godliness whatever
[2:14:20] he will use to play down there's no
[2:14:23] meaning of praying it's just it's just a
[2:14:25] religious thing get down father please
[2:14:27] Lord bless me there is no intimacy he
[2:14:31] killed it he he he he just he just RAV
[2:14:34] your mind and you don't see the
[2:14:35] importance of it it's a spirit of
[2:14:38] apostasy driving the people away from
[2:14:41] God only having the
[2:14:43] form of
[2:14:45] godliness but the power you can see see
[2:14:49] it you can see it we get we get
[2:14:55] pressed oh my
[2:15:03] God so what
[2:15:05] happened the spirit of the age and day
[2:15:07] and time make it so
[2:15:10] busy we turn our our children over to
[2:15:13] secular laws to to train them they're
[2:15:16] going to school oh they're in nth grade
[2:15:18] in sixth grade oh oh yeah you know they
[2:15:21] learing this there but then you see that
[2:15:24] very same child coming with an
[2:15:27] attitude right in your face no the the
[2:15:30] fact about the matter that is that until
[2:15:32] they are born
[2:15:33] again praise the Lord until they are
[2:15:36] born again they are going to to to to
[2:15:39] dance to rock and roll that's what the
[2:15:41] prophet of God said and he said Rock and
[2:15:43] Road ISE is preparing them for the
[2:15:45] battle of
[2:15:46] amag

[2:16:01] Lord and then
[2:16:03] now the age has Crown it out the crown
[2:16:07] of this
[2:16:09] age is artificial

[2:16:16] Lord they don't need they don't even
[2:16:18] need to go

[2:17:05] beginning praise the
[2:17:09] Lord that Fellowship that that that I

[2:17:50] one because what we have against
[2:17:55] us where our age is treading
[2:18:01] to the Le is taking out of hell the
[2:18:05] prophet of God said there
[2:18:07] 1956 he said demons powers are streaming
[2:18:10] out into the
[2:18:14] Earth and we are here living the reality

[2:18:28] 13 he taught by
[2:18:32] example this I'm doing to you do it also
[2:18:35] unto one another the Bible says he
[2:18:38] learned obedience by the things that he
[2:18:41] suffer pointing back to his
[2:18:43] childhood the creator of the universe
[2:18:46] talk about it of Flesh 12 years old he
[2:18:49] was in a camping
[2:18:50] shop see what he was doing he was
[2:18:53] learning he despised the the the trend
[2:18:57] of education for that day he could have
[2:18:59] gone to the Seminary and no he was
[2:19:02] learning he learned
[2:19:04] obedience by the things that he
[2:19:07] suffer and then when he got into his
[2:19:09] ministry he said learn of
[2:19:12] me praise the
[2:19:16] Lord

[2:19:44] parenting I'm a parent
[2:19:46] also I'm I'm seeing my challenges in the
[2:19:57] shadows because sometimes when when the
[2:19:59] people don't uh don't don't don't don't
[2:20:02] grab the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[2:20:05] it just become a personal
[2:20:07] wall and then the truth that's supposed
[2:20:10] to set us free we start casting it
[2:20:12] out who are you to say this to me who
[2:20:15] are you to say this to me what better do
[2:20:16] you have what better that I mean church
[2:20:18] should not be like that

[2:20:55] so imparted by what he
[2:21:00] saw he affected him in a good
[2:21:05] way that he started to look at even the
[2:21:09] life of Jesus he started to look at it
[2:21:11] in a complete different
[2:21:14] way praise the Lord amen
[2:21:18] I see when you have a better
[2:21:21] understanding you don't

[2:21:54] closer to the Lord
[2:21:57] amen hallelujah
[2:22:00] am amen
[2:22:04] amen we are given their
[2:22:10] responsibility as
[2:22:14] parents we are giving the work as a
[2:22:18] we are just managing God's
[2:22:24] children and our job we supposed to be
[2:22:28] like the int
[2:22:31] taker when Jesus talk about a Good
[2:22:33] Samaritan he talk about the int taker
[2:22:35] was giving two coin to be able to that's
[2:22:38] that's our job we are just like the int
[2:22:41] taker we are supposed to take care of
[2:22:44] them we are supposed to make it easy
[2:22:48] for them to fall in love with
[2:22:52] Jesus we supposed to make it easy for
[2:22:56] them to be able to grab what is this all
[2:22:59] about praise the Lord
[2:23:03] amen because until they get their driver
[2:23:06] license you can you can drag them to
[2:23:09] church when they get their driver
[2:23:11] license then they can choose whether
[2:23:13] they want to come or
[2:23:16] not
[2:23:18] praise the Lord amen because of the
[2:23:21] pressure of the
[2:23:23] society we don't we don't go in teaching
[2:23:27] them the
[2:23:28] values that make us to believe what we
[2:23:30] believe or stand what we believe we turn
[2:23:32] to the society the society says well you
[2:23:35] know uh uh uh you know this this is the
[2:23:38] this is the trench of
[2:23:40] dress so the pressure is on the children
[2:23:42] they want to be like their
[2:23:44] friends and then because we love them
[2:23:49] so we turn to
[2:23:52] that less of our value we give more into
[2:23:56] death Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 1 chapter
[2:23:59] 2 Isaiah de with the same thing in his
[2:24:02] days he said children has become their
[2:24:04] leaders
[2:24:09] right no we are called to lead
[2:24:13] him we are called to lead
[2:24:16] him and we must be able to stand on the
[2:24:19] principle of the
[2:24:21] word doing the best that we can to be
[2:24:25] able to minister to these young people
[2:24:29] and help them to
[2:24:31] see what is this all
[2:24:34] about what is this all
[2:24:38] about praise the Lord amen we supposed
[2:24:42] to be their first Sunday school teacher
[2:24:45] Sunday school starts from home yeah
[2:24:48] praise the
[2:24:49] Lord even right in there where Moses
[2:24:52] told the children of Israel he says Sing
[2:24:53] these words unto
[2:24:55] them he says Sing It unto
[2:25:01] them that's a reason why you know what
[2:25:04] when the child come to sing special and
[2:25:06] the parents get embarrassed about it
[2:25:08] it's a shame to the parent
[2:25:12] right your child come to sing special
[2:25:14] you embarrassed about it it's a shame
[2:25:16] you never did your
[2:25:19] work because if you were interested in
[2:25:22] that you would tell them if you want to
[2:25:24] sing a song you should tell me so I can
[2:25:26] tell the deacons oh they say Oh Daddy I
