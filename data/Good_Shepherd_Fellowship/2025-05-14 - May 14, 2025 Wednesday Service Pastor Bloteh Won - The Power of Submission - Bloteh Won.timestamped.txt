[30:36] tonight. I like to read this. Uh
[30:44] uh got this uh
[30:50] uh note of things
[30:53] uh from
[30:55] u one of the saints uh in Russia.
[30:59] Brother Barry is sending out and I
[31:01] thought that it might be a blessing
[31:03] tonight. I'm glad to greet uh all the
[31:07] saints in the name of the Lord Jesus. I
[31:09] want to testify about what the Lord is
[31:12] doing in my life. Recently, I was at
[31:14] work and there was a bombardment of the
[31:18] city and the factory where I work. After
[31:21] two explosion, there was a great anxiety
[31:24] in inside and I thought that we should
[31:28] go to the bomb shelter fast. Although I
[31:31] had never felt such feeling before I
[31:34] decided to go down to a safe
[31:38] place. There were many explosion more
[31:41] than 20. There were great hits on the
[31:44] factory. Some shops were completely
[31:47] destroyed and one uh of the hit was on
[31:51] the place where I work. Now I realized
[31:54] that it was the Lord who made me anxious
[31:57] and thought of shelter. Thank the Lord
[32:00] for saving my life and the life of many
[32:04] of my
[32:06] co-workers. Thank you all for uh all the
[32:08] saints for your prayers and support. May
[32:12] God bless each of you. Amen. Another

[42:42] you for the music. Let's stand on our
[42:44] feet and uh and go into the word
[42:46] tonight.
[42:55] Praise the Lord. I hope you had a good
[42:59] Mother's Day whether you were uh
[43:03] celebrating or you were in uh
[43:08] uh
[43:09] memorial or in
[43:11] memory. We can also celebrate in memory.
[43:15] as we think about the blessed and
[43:18] precious memories.
[43:21] Amen. And then also I hope uh you were
[43:25] able to process what we share with you.
[43:27] I know it was too much information. I
[43:29] held you more than I
[43:32] should but
[43:35] sometimes that's what it takes to be
[43:37] able to get things off of our heart. So
[43:39] tonight we just want to turn to Matthew
[43:42] chapter 6. I want to continue a little
[43:45] bit but in a in a kind of a different
[43:47] direction. I want to talk tonight on the
[43:50] power of
[43:51] submission. The power of submission. The
[43:54] secret uh weapon of the church. The
[43:57] secret weapon of the
[44:03] church. Power of summation. Uh Matthew
[44:07] chapter
[44:10] 6. Matthew chapter 6.
[44:13] very
[44:18] familiar. Matthew chapter 6. Let's read
[44:20] from verse 24 to verse 34. I read verse
[44:26] 24, you read the next, and then we read
[44:29] the last one together. No man can serve
[44:31] two masters, for either he will hate one
[44:35] or love the other, or else he will hold
[44:38] to one and despise the other. You cannot
[44:40] serve God and my money.
[45:00] Behold the fowls of the head for the
[45:03] soul net neither do they reap nor gather
[45:06] into band yet our heavenly father your
[45:09] heavenly father feed them are ye not
[45:12] much better than
[45:18] they and why take ye thought of women
[45:22] consider the ladies of the field how
[45:24] they grow. They torn neither do they
[45:35] spin. Therefore, if God so clothe the
[45:38] grass of the field, which today is, and
[45:42] tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he
[45:45] not much more clothe you, oh ye of
[45:48] little faith.
[45:58] For after all these things do the
[46:01] Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father
[46:04] know that ye have need of all these
[46:07] things,
[46:12] all this righteousness.
[46:17] Take therefore no thought for the moral,
[46:20] for the moral shall take thought of what
[46:23] is sufficient unto the day is the evil
[46:27] thereof. Praise the Lord. Amen. My
[46:31] tongue got stuck to the roof of my
[46:34] mouth. Luke chapter
[46:37] 17. Luke chapter 17.
[46:41] It's a little way just to kind of wake
[46:43] us up and and uh as we
[46:47] just swim on the the the Holy Spirit
[46:52] tonight that he would just cast every
[46:55] tiredness away from us and make the this
[46:59] few minutes we spend in his presence a
[47:01] blessing. Luke chapter 17, let's read
[47:03] from verse 20. Luke 17, we will read
[47:08] from verse 20. And when uh and when he
[47:13] was demanded of the Pharisees when the
[47:15] kingdom of God should come, he answered
[47:18] them and said unto them, the kingdom of
[47:20] God cometh not with observation. Neither
[47:24] shall they say, Lord year or lo, for
[47:27] behold, the kingdom of God is in you.
[47:32] Praise the Lord. Amen. Behold, the
[47:36] kingdom of God is in you. But then Jesus
[47:39] said we must seek the kingdom. So how do
[47:41] we seek the kingdom if the kingdom is in
[47:45] you seek you first the kingdom of
[47:48] heaven. Praise the Lord. So we must not
[47:51] be looking outside. We must be looking
[47:53] inside.
[47:55] Amen. We must be seeking the kingdom
[47:58] inside not from outside. Let's pray
[48:01] together. Father tonight we want to just
[48:05] uh thank you Lord. We want to appreciate
[48:07] you, oh God, Father, for giving us
[48:10] another opportunity, Lord God, to be
[48:13] able to be together tonight and come
[48:16] fellowship around your word. We want to
[48:18] ask your special blessings, oh, Father
[48:20] God, upon the service tonight that you
[48:22] would just come out of the pages of your
[48:24] word. May something be said that will
[48:26] draw us closer to you. Something that
[48:28] will uplift our faith, oh God. May the
[48:31] word be released, oh Father, Lord, and
[48:34] turn loose every
[48:36] wrong influence from our lives. We thank
[48:38] you. We appreciate you Lord. In Jesus
[48:41] name we pray. Amen. The Lord bless you.
[48:44] You may have your
[48:46] seat. The Lord bless you. You may have
[48:49] your
[48:50] seat. Brother Bram says this in the uh
[48:55] the sermon church age which of course is
[48:58] uh just coincide with just what we read
[49:00] from Matthew chapter 6. He says here is
[49:03] where you have to believe again in the
[49:07] love, the goodness, the wisdom of God.
[49:10] This too is needful.
[49:13] Remember he admonish. Take no thought
[49:17] for the moral. What ye shall eat or what
[49:20] ye shall put
[49:22] on. Your father knoweth the things ye
[49:26] have need
[49:27] of. He who clothe the ladies and feed
[49:30] the sparrow shall do much more to you.
[49:34] These physical things are
[49:37] not the true basic necessity of your
[49:41] life. For a man life consisted not of
[49:45] the things he
[49:46] possess, but rather seek ye first the
[49:50] kingdom of God in his righteousness, and
[49:53] all
[49:54] material necessities will be added unto
[49:58] you. The people of God are not
[50:02] material-minded. They are Christminded.
[50:06] They do not seek the treasures that are
[50:09] below. They seek those above. Praise the
[50:13] Lord. So, we just uh we want to look at
[50:17] uh submission tonight with the little
[50:19] time that is before us. I'm hoping that
[50:21] I can be able to drag this to Father's
[50:24] Day. It will be able to help me to cover
[50:27] Father's Day is coming up in
[50:29] June. So, uh it will be able to help us
[50:32] to cover some of our basic year. But
[50:35] tonight, I want to just speak on the
[50:37] power of submission. now and and again I
[50:41] want I want you want us to pay attention
[50:43] because uh like I said on Sunday I was
[50:46] trying to dramatize so I'm using lot of
[50:49] types in kind of for you know trying to
[50:53] drive my my thought or my inspiration
[50:55] home now so uh uh
[51:03] uh so I want I want us to be able to
[51:05] look at something tonight just like I
[51:07] said Jesus says seek ye first the
[51:11] kingdom of heaven and all other things
[51:14] will be added unto you. Now remember now
[51:18] uh I want us I want you to be able to
[51:20] look at it uh look at it like this. Uh
[51:24] if if you if you if you just think about
[51:26] it and look at it in this way um for you
[51:30] to get the
[51:32] benefit of the kingdom for you to get
[51:35] the benefit of the kingdom you have to
[51:39] submit to the rules or the
[51:43] principle of the kingdom.
[51:45] Praise the Lord. You cannot get the
[51:48] benefit of anything if you don't submit
[51:53] to the principle of that thing. You
[51:57] cannot get the benefit of faith unless
[52:00] you submit to the principle of
[52:04] faith. Praise the Lord. And that's one
[52:07] of the biggest thing that uh that that
[52:10] is a hindrance to us in our Christian
[52:12] faith because uh we all believe that uh
[52:18] uh uh you know uh things works by
[52:22] prayer but we must also realize that God
[52:27] pulled a law to everything that he gave
[52:29] us. Praise the Lord. So there is a
[52:32] principle and unless we submit to that
[52:34] principle you will not be able to enjoy
[52:38] the benefit of uh of let me give an
[52:42] example if you don't submit yourself to
[52:46] sleep.
[52:48] Amen. to be able
[52:51] to find that time to sleep and uh when
[52:56] evening is uh time to take a little bit
[52:58] of a nap, you know, uh if you if you
[53:01] don't if you don't do that, you will not
[53:03] enjoy the benefit of of a restful body.
[53:08] Praise the Lord. So that's that's the
[53:10] way I want to look at uh submission
[53:13] tonight. I want to look at it in uh in a
[53:16] way that uh I pray that the Lord will be
[53:19] able to to help us because remember now
[53:22] I'm I'm using it as a secret weapon of
[53:26] the church. And keep in mind we are
[53:29] taking the we are taking the the
[53:31] position of the woman as a type. Praise
[53:34] the Lord. And like I said and I say it
[53:37] over and over again. Many of us, brother
[53:40] Brandham being a prophet,
[53:43] uh uh he tells us that he went to the
[53:47] school of neology and graduated with a
[53:50] degree of typology.
[53:53] Praise the Lord. So in many things,
[53:56] brother Brandham used types.
[53:59] Paul would do the same thing in the
[54:01] scripture as he would talks about the
[54:04] church. He would use a woman as a type.
[54:08] Now where we made a mistake is because
[54:10] we exclude ourself from that picture and
[54:14] we think that un is speaking about the
[54:16] woman and that's the reason why I said
[54:19] on Sunday if we don't understand the
[54:22] position of the woman we will never
[54:24] understand our position as a church and
[54:28] when the church finds its position
[54:31] brother Brandham says the rapture will
[54:34] go. Praise the Lord. Amen. There is one
[54:38] man here that's the man Christ Jesus.
[54:41] We are the church. We are his
[54:45] bride. Are we together? We are his
[54:48] bride. We are the church. There is one
[54:51] man and that is the man Christ Jesus. So
[54:54] we have to keep that principle in our
[54:56] mind. When it comes to the unit of our
[54:59] home, we are the the men, we are the
[55:01] women in our home, the children is all
[55:04] there. when it comes to the big picture
[55:06] because you see the fact about the
[55:08] matter there is that God's redemption
[55:11] program was not for one
[55:14] person it was for a
[55:17] family that's the reason why uh I mean
[55:20] if a man drop off the faith it does not
[55:23] stop
[55:24] redemption the church goes on
[55:28] amen goes
[55:31] on when a person stop coming to church
[55:34] and say, "I don't believe anymore." God
[55:36] don't pause redemption. It's not for one
[55:38] man. It's a family program. Are we
[55:41] together? It's almost like a young man
[55:44] or a man beginning a family. When he
[55:47] thinks about starting a family, he don't
[55:50] think about individual children.
[55:53] Praise the Lord. He thinks about playing
[55:56] for the family. When I have a family,
[55:58] one day I get married, this is what I'm
[56:00] going to do. I'm going to buy a car, you
[56:02] know, so we can be able to travel. I'm
[56:04] going to buy a house. He's thinking
[56:06] about the entire
[56:07] family. So if the Lord blesses him and
[56:10] and he start having children, you know,
[56:13] uh a child could fall sick, the Lord
[56:15] could call a child home. It does not
[56:16] stop the
[56:18] family. The family remember the loss of
[56:21] that child, but the family continue.
[56:24] That's the same thing with the church.
[56:26] God did not make his redemption program
[56:30] for individual. You don't have an
[56:32] individual program. I don't have an
[56:34] individual program. They don't have an
[56:36] indiv. It's it's one
[56:38] program. Are we together? Amen. It's one
[56:42] program. So, so we we have to we have to
[56:45] be able to to to understand we have to
[56:50] be able to understand the position the
[56:52] power of the church is her ability to
[56:56] submit to the word of
[56:59] God. We will never enjoy the
[57:03] blessing of the promises unless we
[57:08] submit to God's word. Yes. Praise the
[57:12] Lord. Amen. If you think you are
[57:16] enjoying the blessings now, think how
[57:19] much more when you continue to summit.
[57:23] Think how much more when you grab the
[57:25] key of submission.
[57:28] Praise the Lord. There is a key, the key
[57:32] of submission.
[57:35] See, that's what we want to look at
[57:36] tonight. We want to look at the key of
[57:39] submission. So I will use this word.
[57:41] That's what I want you to pay attention.
[57:43] I will use this word seek when you look
[57:46] in the scripture. I was I was I was try
[57:49] I was studying and I'm just trying to
[57:51] find where you know uh uh the similarity
[57:54] will come. But I I I want you to be able
[57:57] to see like this uh uh when when when we
[58:01] seek seek the kingdom. That's why Jesus
[58:04] said it's not by observation.
[58:09] Seek the kingdom and his right Jesus
[58:11] says seek you first the kingdom of God
[58:12] and his righteousness and all other
[58:14] things will be out there. Okay. How do I
[58:19] seek? Praise the
[58:23] Lord. How do we
[58:26] seek? Now he says the kingdom of God is
[58:29] not by our salvation. The kingdom of God
[58:33] is in you. Then how do you seek it?
[58:39] That's what I want us to look at tonight
[58:41] because I realize the way to seek the
[58:44] kingdom of God is to
[58:48] submit. When you are submitting to the
[58:50] word, you are seeking, right?
[58:55] Praise the Lord. I mean, you can be
[58:57] zillious and flying your coat every
[58:59] word, you know, and and and and and
[59:02] shouting scripture every word if you are
[59:05] not submitting.
[59:08] if you are not submitting to the
[59:13] word. Praise the Lord. That's so that's
[59:15] why we want to look at tonight because
[59:17] we realize that God placed in the woman
[59:22] that is a type of the church. It's in
[59:25] her. It's in her sacred virtue to
[59:31] submit. It's in
[59:33] her. Praise the Lord.
[59:36] Amen. You see that is the reason why you
[59:39] don't demand
[59:41] it. No, you don't demand it. You don't
[59:44] demand summation. God do not demand
[59:46] submission because submission to the
[59:49] church comes by revelation. Right. When
[59:52] the church realize that her secret power
[59:56] is to submit to the
[59:59] word, then God don't have to make us
[1:00:02] sick and and and and and make us to to
[1:00:04] our our h you know our house to get in
[1:00:07] trouble or you know to just to be doing
[1:00:09] things in our lives so we can s I make
[1:00:11] sure I will bring you to salvation. God
[1:00:13] don't have to do
[1:00:17] that. Praise the Lord. He don't have to
[1:00:20] do
[1:00:23] that because it's a secret
[1:00:26] power and he want the church to be able
[1:00:30] to identify
[1:00:32] it. You want the church to be able to
[1:00:34] grab the revelation.
[1:00:38] Are we are we together? Because that is
[1:00:41] the thing that is going to open the
[1:00:43] heavens for us. Amen. Is going to open
[1:00:46] the blessings for us.
[1:00:48] Are we together?
[1:00:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:01] Now, so as as we
[1:01:04] uh as you were talking on
[1:01:16] this, it's so beautiful when you look at
[1:01:19] this year that I mean I kind of throw
[1:01:20] some few things uh down in my in my
[1:01:25] notes here.
[1:01:31] I was looking also at the word of uh uh
[1:01:36] humility and and and and
[1:01:40] submitting. Both of them relatively
[1:01:43] carry the same concept. But when you
[1:01:46] look at the word, but they have distinct
[1:01:50] meaning to be humble and to be
[1:01:54] submissive. They carry the same concept
[1:01:56] but they have unique distinct
[1:02:01] meaning. Humitate is a character trait
[1:02:04] is a state of being. When a person is
[1:02:08] humble is a state of
[1:02:10] being while submission is an
[1:02:16] act. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:02:22] While submission is an act, as we as we
[1:02:26] look into the word, as we go ahead, you
[1:02:28] will see uh uh uh while submission is an
[1:02:32] action, an act of yielding to another's
[1:02:35] authority of
[1:02:37] will. Humility often proceed submission.
[1:02:42] You can never be submissive without
[1:02:44] being humble
[1:02:48] because humbleness condition you to be
[1:02:52] submissive.
[1:02:54] Are we together? Amen. Humbleness
[1:02:58] condition you for you to be
[1:03:03] submissive. So that's what we we we
[1:03:06] trying to look at tonight.
[1:03:09] And uh I will start off
[1:03:11] here.
[1:03:18] Uh we will see
[1:03:21] Jesus. I'll start out of here. Just like
[1:03:25] why does a woman every time she gets
[1:03:28] married put a veil over her face? She's
[1:03:31] coming to her husband the head just like
[1:03:34] Rebecca did. She put a veil over her
[1:03:38] face to meet Isaac. She has she has no
[1:03:42] more head. Isaac is her head. And the
[1:03:46] church ought to ought to be so
[1:03:49] submissive to the word. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:53] That that
[1:03:55] that is ve its own
[1:03:59] face. It has no head.
[1:04:04] The nature of a woman is to submit to a
[1:04:08] man. And that's what the church
[1:04:11] ought ought to be doing. Submitting to
[1:04:15] Christ, to his word, to his doctrine, to
[1:04:19] his
[1:04:21] principle. Praise the Lord. Are we
[1:04:24] together?
[1:04:25] Amen. So you see the uh uh the the the
[1:04:30] ancient custom of wearing the veil uh uh
[1:04:33] was just trying to show a place of
[1:04:37] hairship. Okay. It was trying to show a
[1:04:40] place of hairship and when she comes and
[1:04:42] remove that veil or the man remove the
[1:04:45] veil is it it was it was a sign of of
[1:04:50] submission. Praise the Lord. He's
[1:04:53] submitting you know uh to to that
[1:04:56] hairship of of the man now. So the thing
[1:05:00] there is that the uh uh
[1:05:04] uh where I want to go with this thought
[1:05:06] is that the like I I continue to say we
[1:05:09] have to look at it in the place of the
[1:05:13] church. Are we together? We have to look
[1:05:16] at it in the condition the position of
[1:05:18] the church. And uh when we look at it
[1:05:22] like that uh uh it will it will it will
[1:05:25] bless us will will be strengthened.
[1:05:27] Praise the Lord. It's so easy to go on
[1:05:31] the trail of just looking at it as a
[1:05:33] condition of the woman alone and uh
[1:05:36] which of course that that we supposed to
[1:05:38] know and we know that is being preached
[1:05:40] is in the scripture but we looking at
[1:05:43] the the position of the church. The
[1:05:47] powerful weapon the secret weapon of the
[1:05:50] church is submission. Are we together?
[1:05:54] Praise the Lord. Look at this. Look at
[1:05:57] this. I was thinking about few example
[1:05:59] in the scripture. One of them that stood
[1:06:02] out to me is that Sunday we read where
[1:06:07] the Bible said the birth of Jesus was on
[1:06:09] this
[1:06:10] wise and the scripture says the angel
[1:06:14] came to Mary and said Mary you know you
[1:06:18] found favor with God and and uh uh uh
[1:06:21] you know and and and the Holy Ghost is
[1:06:23] going to overshadow you. Are we
[1:06:26] together?
[1:06:28] Okay, see this type here where Mary now
[1:06:32] she said for the angel be it unto me I
[1:06:37] calling to your
[1:06:39] word okay which will be a a beautiful
[1:06:43] type of submitting to the word I don't
[1:06:47] know how this is going to be but I
[1:06:49] submit myself to the word be it unto me
[1:06:52] I calling to your
[1:06:54] word are we together praise the Lord.
[1:06:57] Now see the benefit of
[1:07:01] submission. Mary submitted herself to
[1:07:05] the word for what the angel said and she
[1:07:08] said, "Be it unto me. I calling to your
[1:07:10] word." She went home to tell
[1:07:13] Joseph. Joseph got in a little bit of a
[1:07:16] trouble in his mind. I've never seen
[1:07:18] this. I've never heard this before. The
[1:07:20] Bible says that he was thinking to put
[1:07:23] Mary away privately. But see the benefit
[1:07:27] of submission because she submitted to
[1:07:30] the word. The Lord intervene.
[1:07:38] Praise the Lord. You see how the battle
[1:07:40] is the Lord and the way he fight our
[1:07:44] battle
[1:07:45] is by us submitting to the word. Yeah,
[1:07:48] because she submitted to the
[1:07:51] word, God interveneed by sending an
[1:07:54] angel to ex to convince
[1:08:01] Joseph. She didn't had Joseph. I I I
[1:08:04] mean I I swear I I swear, Joseph, I
[1:08:06] rather never did anything. I I believe
[1:08:09] me, Joseph. I mean, I I I swear you can
[1:08:11] take me to the doctor. She didn't have
[1:08:13] to do that.
[1:08:23] because she submitted to the
[1:08:25] word. She submitted to what God has
[1:08:29] spoken by an angel. She said, "Be it
[1:08:31] unto
[1:08:34] me." Are we
[1:08:37] together? The
[1:08:39] angel fought on her behalf.
[1:08:46] That's the power that is in
[1:08:48] submission. And that is the place where
[1:08:50] we struggle.
[1:08:55] That's the place where we struggle. The
[1:08:58] Bible says if my people that are called
[1:09:00] by my
[1:09:02] name, the scripture says, if they will
[1:09:05] humble themselves,
[1:09:11] Amen. Are we together?
[1:09:15] If they will humble themselves and
[1:09:19] prayed, confess their sins and what?
[1:09:24] Seek my
[1:09:27] face. The Bible already mentioned pray
[1:09:30] in that. So seeking his face will not be
[1:09:33] praying.
[1:09:39] If my people that are called by my name,
[1:09:41] which of course is the position of the
[1:09:43] wife, she takes the husband name, that's
[1:09:46] the position of the church. The church
[1:09:48] has taken the name of Christ.
[1:09:53] If she will humble
[1:09:56] herself and
[1:09:59] prayed and turned from her wicked ways
[1:10:03] and seek my face. Yeah.
[1:10:07] So this seeking my face or seeking first
[1:10:10] the kingdom of God, I'm taking it in a
[1:10:12] sense of
[1:10:25] submitting because when you are seeking
[1:10:28] something is is it's a I mean you are on
[1:10:31] a hunt you are searching.
[1:10:35] Praise the
[1:10:36] Lord.
[1:10:44] Amen. Moses told the
[1:10:47] Lord he wanted to see
[1:10:50] him. The Lord said, "Okay, Moses, you
[1:10:52] go." You know, he says, "Go and stand on
[1:10:55] the
[1:10:56] rock. Are we together?"
[1:10:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:02] And uh uh yeah, you know that that that
[1:11:05] that that anxiousness that we have, we
[1:11:07] we we want it now. You know, we we we
[1:11:11] want it. And we must we must we must
[1:11:13] realize that God is faithful to his word
[1:11:16] all the time.
[1:11:18] He never fail and he will never fail. He
[1:11:22] never did it. He would not start doing
[1:11:24] it now.
[1:11:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:32] But it's for the church to seek his
[1:11:35] face. Look at Hannah in the
[1:11:39] temple. She needed a child and she was
[1:11:42] she was seeking the face of the Lord.
[1:11:45] But see what happened. Even when Eli the
[1:11:49] priest mishonest to her.
[1:11:52] Amen. He mishonest to her. He even
[1:11:55] insulted her.
[1:11:58] But what did she do? She submitted
[1:12:00] herself. No, my
[1:12:03] Lord. She never She never bounced
[1:12:11] back. I said, "Well, maybe you are the
[1:12:14] one drunk. I'm not drunk."
[1:12:18] No. Even when she was misunderstood, she
[1:12:22] still submitted herself to that
[1:12:25] authority. And then the blessing
[1:12:29] comes is the secret weapon all the
[1:12:37] time.
[1:12:44] Amen. Brother Era was speaking last
[1:12:47] week. He talked about jail. when uh when
[1:12:50] she took that that man into into her
[1:12:55] tent, she knew that he was
[1:12:58] terrifying
[1:13:01] Israel. She did not defend
[1:13:04] herself. She submitted herself to his
[1:13:07] authority.
[1:13:09] Yet, he was the one that was
[1:13:15] terrifying. When she came, when he came,
[1:13:18] she never stand on a porch and start
[1:13:20] yelling, "Yeah, he's here. He's here."
[1:13:22] She will be the next one dead.
[1:13:26] Praise the Lord. But she had the
[1:13:29] temperament to submit herself.
[1:13:32] Gave him food to eat, gave him water to
[1:13:34] drink, give him milk, put a pillow down,
[1:13:38] and by that way she was able to destroy
[1:13:40] the enemy.
[1:13:51] Are we
[1:13:54] together now? So Jesus says we will
[1:13:59] enjoy the
[1:14:00] benefit. Seek you first the
[1:14:05] kingdom and all of his benefits will be
[1:14:09] yours. Amen.
[1:14:11] You will enjoy the rest. You will enjoy
[1:14:14] the joy. You will enjoy everything that
[1:14:17] is promised within the
[1:14:21] kingdom. How do we seek it? That's why
[1:14:24] we trying to find out.
[1:14:27] Amen. By constantly submitting ourself
[1:14:31] to the
[1:14:33] word. Are we together? By constantly
[1:14:37] submitting ourself to the word.
[1:14:43] And that's where the church is
[1:14:45] struggling. You know, we want we want to
[1:14:47] be in a mystery. We want to, you know,
[1:14:49] we can we can quote the word like a
[1:14:51] machine gun. You know, we use the word
[1:14:53] to fight one another. You know, the
[1:14:55] scripture say that yes, it's also say
[1:14:57] this, you know, and we do all of that.
[1:15:00] And when we are doing that, we still do
[1:15:03] not come out
[1:15:05] victorious. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:15:12] Now if what we are doing what we are
[1:15:14] doing that we think is right if it's not
[1:15:17] making you happy then it's not right.
[1:15:22] Praise the Lord with whatever you are
[1:15:25] doing and and whatever uh h defense you
[1:15:28] are thinking and whatever way you think
[1:15:31] that uh you know you are protecting
[1:15:33] yourself if it is not making you happy.
[1:15:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:38] I mean, if you if you putting iron bars
[1:15:40] to the window and and and and changing
[1:15:42] the locks and putting steel and you are
[1:15:45] still
[1:15:47] afraid, praise the
[1:15:49] Lord, then you better change. You better
[1:15:51] think about changing that and start
[1:15:54] learning to trust the Lord.
[1:16:04] Glory be to God.
[1:16:07] Amen.
[1:16:09] As we were talking about uh uh
[1:16:16] uh heavenly treasures in earththing
[1:16:18] vessels and trying to bring that picture
[1:16:22] of how you know this vessel that we are
[1:16:26] God trusted to put you know his heavenly
[1:16:30] treasure the Holy Ghost and gave us his
[1:16:32] gift you know we're now spiritual gift
[1:16:35] and five for ministry put it right into
[1:16:37] the
[1:16:41] body. Praise the
[1:16:45] Lord. And how God will also raise up to
[1:16:49] a place of
[1:16:52] equality. Brother Rambo says in Christ
[1:16:55] is the ministry of God revealed that he
[1:16:57] brought us to
[1:16:59] partnership. The strip Paul says that he
[1:17:02] make us co-equal.
[1:17:06] Praise the
[1:17:07] Lord. Code
[1:17:09] equal. I want us to look at that a
[1:17:12] little bit tonight because I was I was
[1:17:14] trying, like I said, I keep go I'll keep
[1:17:16] going back and forth so I can be able to
[1:17:18] really put the nail in the coffin.
[1:17:21] Amen. Now, so uh uh uh look at look at
[1:17:26] the the message uh Job. Get a quote here
[1:17:29] from from the message Job. But God
[1:17:33] putting Satan almost quote equal with
[1:17:37] him. Satan taking the things of God and
[1:17:40] perverting them into the evil thoughts
[1:17:43] and through there begins to pervert
[1:17:45] things into evil instead of good. Why?
[1:17:48] Because he was called
[1:17:50] equal. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now here
[1:17:54] is the danger of coal equaleness. The
[1:17:58] danger of coequaless is that when a
[1:18:01] person do not have character.
[1:18:04] Amen.
[1:18:05] And they and they have been and they
[1:18:07] have been brought to co-equalness they
[1:18:10] will they will be they will they will
[1:18:12] have the tendency of looking for
[1:18:15] supremacy. Yeah.
[1:18:21] How have that exalted herself?
[1:18:25] That's what happened to Lucifer.
[1:18:29] Have you ever thought why in Exodus
[1:18:31] chapter 25, God told Moses uh when you
[1:18:35] build a tabernacle right over the ark of
[1:18:38] the covenant, put uh an emblem of two
[1:18:47] angels. Praise the Lord. Put an emblem
[1:18:50] of two angels right over the cover of
[1:18:53] the mercy seat.
[1:18:55] that was speaks of the two I angel uh h
[1:19:00] uh that that was that was there in
[1:19:03] heaven you know called equaless micer
[1:19:05] and
[1:19:09] Lucifer praise the lord and many times
[1:19:12] that is the thing that we struggle in
[1:19:14] our
[1:19:15] life whether in in
[1:19:21] family because it's it almost looks like
[1:19:24] we feel like a a a a loser. We feel like
[1:19:27] our position is threatened. So in that
[1:19:30] way, we start to look for some form of
[1:19:36] supremacy. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:39] Amen. We start to look for some form of
[1:19:42] supremacy. That's what you know brother
[1:19:44] says uh power without character is
[1:19:47] satonic.
[1:19:51] Because when you are given the power to
[1:19:52] be
[1:19:54] co-equal, if you don't have
[1:20:00] character, you will think now you can
[1:20:02] rule your pastor. You will think now you
[1:20:05] can rule the deacons because every every
[1:20:07] one of us are
[1:20:10] equal. But we we have to know that we
[1:20:14] are brought to the place of co-equalness
[1:20:16] under
[1:20:18] hairship. And that hairship is the word.
[1:20:22] So the word keeps us in our different
[1:20:24] position. It keeps us in our place as
[1:20:27] husband. It keep us in our place as
[1:20:30] wife. It keep us in our place as
[1:20:32] preachers. It keep you in your place as
[1:20:38] leotes. Are we
[1:20:41] together? Listening the pagama church
[1:20:44] age where Satan's seat is.
[1:20:47] The reason that this
[1:20:50] part of the illogy of the spirit is
[1:20:53] because these brave soldiers of the
[1:20:56] cross were overcoming Satan right in the
[1:20:59] midst of his own throne room. They were
[1:21:02] winning the battle through the name and
[1:21:04] the fate of Jesus right in the camp of
[1:21:07] the lead of the leader of darkness. What
[1:21:11] a tremendous commendation. Yeah, like
[1:21:14] the mighty men of David who vaded who
[1:21:18] invaded the camp of the enemy to bring
[1:21:21] David thirst quenching water.
[1:21:24] So these so these giants of faith invail
[1:21:28] the the the the realm of of Satanless
[1:21:33] stronghold and by preaching and exalting
[1:21:37] brawl the water of salvation to those
[1:21:40] who live under the shadows of death.
[1:21:45] Now, as much as these words concerning
[1:21:48] the throne and the reign of Satan are a
[1:21:51] part of God's praise for his elect, they
[1:21:55] actually set a stage for the denouncing
[1:21:59] of the evil that has gained supremacy in
[1:22:04] the
[1:22:05] church. Praise the Lord. Amen. So you
[1:22:09] see that's that's word that's that's
[1:22:11] that's that's that's the
[1:22:15] danger. So it's either we are submitting
[1:22:19] ourself or we will be seeking
[1:22:24] supremacitive. Praise the Lord. When you
[1:22:27] hear people says uh uh well I believe in
[1:22:30] God but I mean I mean now it's it's
[1:22:33] myself first.
[1:22:37] Amen. Now it's myself
[1:22:40] first. You know, I'm I'm I'm tired with
[1:22:43] this church thing. I I still believe in
[1:22:45] God. I I still believe in God. I still
[1:22:46] worship God. But now it's myself
[1:22:48] first. You will see that somewhere they
[1:22:52] have loose submissiveness to the word
[1:22:56] and now they are looking for supremacy.
[1:23:01] Praise the
[1:23:03] Lord. Are we together?
[1:23:07] Amen.
[1:23:09] Look at
[1:23:13] Abigail. When she heard what Neba did to
[1:23:17] David and his
[1:23:19] men, praise the
[1:23:22] Lord. What she did? She ran quickly. The
[1:23:25] Bible says, "And she bowed to David. She
[1:23:28] said, "Oh, look at your
[1:23:31] handmmaid." She submitted. She submitted
[1:23:34] herself to to that authority because he
[1:23:37] was going to destroy. David said this
[1:23:40] day you have you have you have saved my
[1:23:42] hands from sharing blood.
[1:23:46] Amen. He say you have saved me from
[1:23:49] sharing
[1:23:51] blood. Well, so in in in in submitting
[1:23:54] to the word in submitting to to to to to
[1:23:58] David authority she saved her foolish
[1:24:01] husband.
[1:24:04] Praise the
[1:24:05] Lord. Even though God will remember the
[1:24:09] wrong that he have done and his blood
[1:24:11] will be on his own head.
[1:24:14] Are we together? So you see you look
[1:24:17] through the scripture you will see
[1:24:20] that submissiveness is not a weakness.
[1:24:25] No it's not a weakness. It's a secret
[1:24:28] weapon. Yes. But it also come by
[1:24:31] revelation.
[1:24:33] Praise the Lord. You can't practice it.
[1:24:37] You cannot practice it. It comes by
[1:24:40] revelation. When the church realized
[1:24:42] that that is her power in the midst of
[1:24:47] her struggle and her danger, she said,
[1:24:49] "Lord, be it unto me according to your
[1:24:51] word." Not my will but your will. Jesus
[1:24:55] kept submitting himself. Not my will but
[1:24:58] your will.
[1:25:04] Are we together?
[1:25:06] We want power. How do we get
[1:25:09] it? By submission to the
[1:25:13] word. We have to submit to the word
[1:25:17] every day. That's the reason why you
[1:25:19] must read your Bible and pray every day.
[1:25:22] When you read the word, find that
[1:25:25] promise in the word and say, "Lord, I
[1:25:27] submit myself to this." Amen.
[1:25:36] Are we together? Because you know when
[1:25:39] we think about power, we think about the
[1:25:42] church flexing her muscle. We will speak
[1:25:45] we will speak mixing link into
[1:25:47] existence. Jesus said you will speak
[1:25:49] this mountain and said and said h be thy
[1:25:52] removed and you will you will be
[1:25:54] removed. But we we don't also
[1:25:57] see what happened. Look at Elijah and
[1:26:00] his servant on the
[1:26:01] mountain. The Syrian's army coming. He's
[1:26:04] not saying, "Lord, let fire come from
[1:26:06] our mouth and consume them." He said,
[1:26:09] "Open his eyes. Let him see what is
[1:26:11] fighting our battle."
[1:26:14] As you are submitting to the word, God
[1:26:17] is taking care of your challenges.
[1:26:19] Hallelujah.
[1:26:23] Praise the Lord. As we are submitting to
[1:26:26] the word, he's fighting our battle
[1:26:29] because the battle is the Lord's.
[1:26:32] Amen. He's fighting our
[1:26:36] battle. So to enjoy the benefit of the
[1:26:39] kingdom, you must submit to the
[1:26:42] principle of the kingdom. We cannot be
[1:26:45] we cannot be disregarding God's word,
[1:26:47] disobeying God's word and you think you
[1:26:50] will enjoy the benefit. No, you won't
[1:26:52] enjoy the benefit. You might enjoy the
[1:26:56] atmosphere. Praise the Lord. We must
[1:26:58] enjoy the
[1:27:02] atmosphere. But for us to be able to to
[1:27:05] enjoy the benefit, count our blessings,
[1:27:08] name them one by
[1:27:09] one, we must learn that principle of
[1:27:13] daily submitting to the word. Praise the
[1:27:17] Lord. If something is rising in your
[1:27:20] life, an anger, a temper, a thought that
[1:27:23] is disturbing you, submit there to God.
[1:27:29] Don't give yourself reason to to fall
[1:27:31] into that thought
[1:27:33] process. You'll be losing your
[1:27:37] victory. Are we together? You will be
[1:27:40] losing your
[1:27:42] victory.
[1:27:44] Hallelujah.
[1:27:46] Amen. I was looking at this also.
[1:27:52] Uh preacher, wouldn't you like that is
[1:27:55] uh uh uh and that sea shall possess the
[1:27:57] gates? Preacher, wouldn't you like to
[1:27:59] see that in your church walk in this
[1:28:02] church and look down through and look
[1:28:05] down alone through here? See both men
[1:28:08] and women godly, sinless, sitting
[1:28:11] sitting there just charged with the
[1:28:14] power of God. He says sin could not walk
[1:28:18] in
[1:28:21] Give me a church. Give me 10 men. Jesus
[1:28:25] had 12.
[1:28:28] Amen. One was the
[1:28:30] devil. He had 12. But with those 12
[1:28:35] men, they turned the wall upside down.
[1:28:38] That's what the scripture says. With
[1:28:40] those 12 men, they turned the word
[1:28:44] upside down.
[1:28:46] He says, "Give me 10 10 men, real Jews
[1:28:51] of God, the royal sea. Put them uh uh
[1:28:55] put them men together and watch what
[1:28:58] would take
[1:29:00] place or give me this little handful of
[1:29:04] people like that and I will show you a
[1:29:08] light that the word will run to." That's
[1:29:13] right. That's what God want us to be.
[1:29:17] You are a city sitting on a hill. Praise
[1:29:22] the Lord. Amen. You are a city sitting
[1:29:25] on the hill. You know that's what
[1:29:28] happened. Just uh uh uh uh you know uh
[1:29:32] uh uh when two or three submit
[1:29:34] themselves to the word, you see the
[1:29:36] power of God. Praise the Lord. You don't
[1:29:40] see the emotion of God. It's not the
[1:29:42] emotion. It's not the the the physical
[1:29:45] manifestation that we we we turn to be
[1:29:48] the power of God. It's the thing that
[1:29:51] brings our tongue under
[1:29:53] control. The thing that is able to
[1:29:55] control our
[1:29:57] temperament. Praise the Lord. That's
[1:30:02] power. Not when you can lash out, but
[1:30:06] when you can hold yourself down. That's
[1:30:08] power.
[1:30:14] question and answers. Oh brother, give
[1:30:15] me the church full of the power, fold of
[1:30:18] the Holy Ghost. God will do in one year
[1:30:23] what all the the theologies failed to do
[1:30:27] in 2,000 years. Amen. So we still need
[1:30:30] to get there because we've been here
[1:30:32] more than one year.
[1:30:35] We still need to get there because we've
[1:30:37] been around this corner more than one
[1:30:39] year.
[1:30:40] We're not there yet. Amen. We just we we
[1:30:45] I mean we we we
[1:30:46] we praise the
[1:30:51] Lord. You know where I'm going with the
[1:30:54] you wait till the anointing of the
[1:30:57] church really strike
[1:31:00] home to their faithful little remnant
[1:31:03] after the doors of the Gentile is
[1:31:05] closed. Oh God will anoint the church.
[1:31:08] Then he who is filthy, let him be filthy
[1:31:13] still. He who righteous, let him be
[1:31:15] righteous still. And he who is holy, be
[1:31:18] holy still. God will anoint the church
[1:31:20] with with the power and things will be
[1:31:24] taking place.
[1:31:27] Not only that then, but he's doing it
[1:31:29] now. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:34] Seek you first the kingdom of heaven.
[1:31:37] Not by all salvation.
[1:31:39] Praise the Lord. Not by all
[1:31:42] salvation. Seek it in you because the
[1:31:46] kingdom of God is in
[1:31:49] you. Praise the
[1:31:52] Lord. And then all other things will be
[1:31:55] added. Solomon say he that can control
[1:31:58] his uh his own spirit can rule a city.
[1:32:12] Praise the
[1:32:14] Lord. Sometimes you find people, some
[1:32:17] people that are humble, they are not
[1:32:19] submissive. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's
[1:32:23] just that they don't want to talk.
[1:32:26] And many times it does not mean that if
[1:32:28] you don't want to talk or sometimes you
[1:32:30] we take people that talk too much as as
[1:32:32] arrogant people. Sometime people that
[1:32:35] talk too much they are just they just
[1:32:36] talk foolishly if they are not saying
[1:32:39] the right thing. But sometimes you can
[1:32:41] find uh uh some of the most quiet people
[1:32:44] to be very
[1:32:45] arrogant because they're just looking at
[1:32:48] you. Say what you want to
[1:32:50] say. I'm going to do what I want to do.
[1:32:55] Praise the Lord. Now, Brother Brham
[1:32:57] said, "Yeah, in humble
[1:32:59] yourself."
[1:33:00] Amen. He said, "Yeah, in humble
[1:33:03] thyself." You know, people want power
[1:33:06] and really they don't know what power
[1:33:09] is.
[1:33:12] We take
[1:33:13] emotion. We take, you know, the the the
[1:33:16] physical manifestation, you know, the
[1:33:19] jumping and the shouting. He says, "We
[1:33:21] want power." We really don't know what
[1:33:22] power is.
[1:33:27] They don't really
[1:33:29] know what goes with
[1:33:31] it. The way up is down
[1:33:35] always. If you want power, see how
[1:33:38] humble you can
[1:33:40] get. Just just get away. Just get away
[1:33:45] from all your wallet thinking. Humble
[1:33:48] yourself before God. And then you will
[1:33:52] get more power than the man that runs
[1:33:56] all over the building and make a big lot
[1:33:59] of noise. See, because you have been
[1:34:03] able to conquer
[1:34:06] yourself and submit yourself to Christ.
[1:34:11] You have been able to conquer yourself
[1:34:14] and submit yourself to
[1:34:16] Christ. Praise the Lord. and commit
[1:34:20] yourself to Christ. You see
[1:34:23] uh to humble yourself before him. That's
[1:34:27] really
[1:34:32] power. Show me a church that's humble,
[1:34:34] real
[1:34:35] humble, not arrogant. Say a church just
[1:34:39] just sweet, humble church. I will show
[1:34:42] you a church that has the favor and
[1:34:44] power of God in it.
[1:34:53] That's the thing to take humility
[1:34:56] humbling ourself before God letting God
[1:35:01] just work through us. Don't have to make
[1:35:05] a lot of noise about
[1:35:07] it. Don't have to make a lot of
[1:35:10] noise. Are we together?
[1:35:19] So you see he he that's that's the
[1:35:22] position of the
[1:35:25] church. He bring us all that was in God
[1:35:29] he pour into
[1:35:31] Christ. Jesus said all power in heaven
[1:35:35] and
[1:35:36] earth is given to
[1:35:39] me and then all that was in Christ he
[1:35:42] pour into the church.
[1:35:45] Why is called equaless?
[1:35:49] Praise the Lord. He never kept a little
[1:35:52] bit of power behind to feel more
[1:35:54] powerful than the
[1:35:55] church because he knows the church will
[1:35:58] be in his
[1:36:01] absence. So whatsoever you need, God got
[1:36:05] it.
[1:36:07] Praise the Lord. Whatsoever we need, God
[1:36:10] got it.
[1:36:12] Are we together?
[1:36:16] Amen. That's the secret of the church.
[1:36:18] Submissiveness is is a it's a secret
[1:36:21] power. It's a
[1:36:25] virtue. Praise the Lord. It's a virtue.
[1:36:29] But uh uh it's it's being misunderstood
[1:36:31] and people think it means weakness and
[1:36:34] they think that uh you know uh it means
[1:36:37] to be inferior.
[1:36:44] That's the reason why the scripture will
[1:36:45] says wife submit yourself to your
[1:36:47] husband because God put it in her. It's
[1:36:51] there. Now she has to discover it. She
[1:36:55] has to get the key how to use
[1:36:59] it. Praise the
[1:37:01] Lord. Or else she will always think that
[1:37:05] uh is an inferior place. She will not
[1:37:07] she will not see the benefit that is in
[1:37:10] it. And that is the same thing with the
[1:37:15] church. That's the reason why the church
[1:37:18] is always coming up with new
[1:37:20] program. Let's do this. So the church
[1:37:23] let's let's go on 21 day fast, dry fast
[1:37:26] and we can make all of this program. But
[1:37:29] yet we are not submitting to the word.
[1:37:32] We're just going on hunger strike. And
[1:37:35] right after the hunger strike, everybody
[1:37:37] go back into what they want to do. And
[1:37:39] then they are fussing year and argument
[1:37:41] year and all the homes is out of
[1:37:46] order. And then the next morning again
[1:37:48] every month the last uh uh weekend every
[1:37:51] morning is the church fast and prayer.
[1:37:52] Church let's come together let's fast
[1:37:54] and pray. We keep fasting and praying.
[1:37:55] We keep fasting and praying but we don't
[1:37:57] have the power. Why? Because we're not
[1:37:59] submitting to the word.
[1:38:04] We are trying to work our way to power.
[1:38:14] Praise the
[1:38:20] Lord. The angel told that prophet, "If
[1:38:23] you will be
[1:38:25] sincere, nothing will stand before your
[1:38:29] prayer." Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:38:33] and and and and and you know uh uh uh in
[1:38:38] sincerity it takes a lot of
[1:38:43] submission. Praise the
[1:38:46] Lord. Hallelujah. It takes a lot of
[1:38:50] submission because uh uh we we we have
[1:38:53] the tendency proud is a is a sense of
[1:38:56] the fall. We have the tendency to want
[1:38:58] to protect our image. We have the
[1:39:00] tendency. So in protecting our image
[1:39:02] sometime we change the story we we try
[1:39:04] to dress it up so we can look like we
[1:39:06] you know uh no I mean some uh uh I mean
[1:39:10] sincere we must be sincere. So it takes
[1:39:14] the power of
[1:39:19] submission. That is the secret weapon
[1:39:22] that the church has. Prayer is the most
[1:39:25] powerful weapon, but but submission is a
[1:39:29] secret
[1:39:31] weapon. It's a
[1:39:33] secret explosion that the church
[1:39:40] has. So that virtue that is given to the
[1:39:44] church, you have to remember now she's
[1:39:46] giving her virtue for redemption.
[1:39:51] This will all men know that you are my
[1:39:54] disciples. She's giving a virtue for
[1:40:03] redemption. Are we together?
[1:40:16] Think about uh uh this keep flashing my
[1:40:20] mind. I was listening to something today
[1:40:22] so it just can't get get away from my
[1:40:24] mind. Think about uh uh uh uh uh David's
[1:40:27] wife, Saul's
[1:40:32] daughter. And uh uh she felt embarrassed
[1:40:36] because David was
[1:40:38] dancing and she just couldn't hold
[1:40:42] herself. Praise the Lord. She just felt
[1:40:45] like I need I need to tell him a piece
[1:40:47] of my mind. You know, this is not the
[1:40:51] attitude of a king. and she kind of lost
[1:40:54] it
[1:40:55] completely. God was not happy with
[1:40:57] her. Praise the
[1:41:07] Lord. It's a secret weapon to the
[1:41:09] church.
[1:41:17] So as we as we think about possessing
[1:41:20] our vessel or possessing uh uh uh uh you
[1:41:25] know uh um heavenly treasure in the eft
[1:41:30] vessel we got to think about this also
[1:41:33] you know that God God designed it that
[1:41:36] way.
[1:41:38] That's the way he want the church to
[1:41:42] move before him. Dearly submitting
[1:41:44] ourself to the word. Praise the
[1:41:47] Lord. Dearly submitting our our our
[1:41:51] weaknesses and submitting our desires,
[1:41:54] submitting our plans, submitting
[1:41:57] everything that we are. Praise the
[1:41:59] Lord. How did how the Esther came to
[1:42:04] power? Praise the Lord. How did she came
[1:42:07] to power? Yes. A Hebrew girl wanting to
[1:42:12] be a gentile
[1:42:17] queen. I mean, she could quote all the
[1:42:20] Torah to them according to the Torah.
[1:42:22] No, this is this we can't do in the
[1:42:24] Torah. This they will just kick her out
[1:42:26] of the palace.
[1:42:32] But Malachi counseled her and told her,
[1:42:35] "Submit yourself to everything that you
[1:42:38] are asked to
[1:42:46] do. By submission, she came to the
[1:42:50] throne." Praise the Lord.
[1:42:55] Amen. And this church can only rise by
[1:42:59] submission. Unless we are submitting to
[1:43:02] the word. I mean uh uh uh we will keep
[1:43:05] we will keep struggling to manage it. We
[1:43:08] keep struggling to manage ourself,
[1:43:11] manage our faith, manage our finance,
[1:43:14] manage our
[1:43:18] health. And we all have become
[1:43:21] managers. But when we submit to the
[1:43:25] word, that's our freedom. When the Bible
[1:43:29] says where the spirit of the Lord is,
[1:43:31] there is
[1:43:36] liberty. We abuse the liberty when we
[1:43:39] when we want to do what we think that uh
[1:43:42] we must do. No, we must submit to the
[1:43:44] word. We must submit to the order of the
[1:43:46] church. We must submit to what the
[1:43:49] scripture says.
[1:43:51] Are we together?
[1:43:54] You see, that is the place where where
[1:43:57] Pentecost got it wrong because they
[1:43:59] thought they had the gift of the spirit
[1:44:02] and because the gift was manifesting, it
[1:44:04] was just all over the place. Whatever
[1:44:07] the preacher is preaching, they are
[1:44:08] speaking in tongues and somebody is
[1:44:10] prophesying and all of that. But there
[1:44:13] was there is an order. Paul put an
[1:44:15] order. The prophet of the the the spirit
[1:44:18] of the prophet is subject to the
[1:44:21] prophet and that is the place also where
[1:44:24] you we see that we have not grown
[1:44:27] enough. Why? Because it's only children
[1:44:30] when the parents are talking they are
[1:44:33] interrupting. It's a sign that maturity
[1:44:37] has not come yet.
[1:44:41] But when maturity comes in, everybody
[1:44:43] wait for their
[1:44:49] time. So when the age came to its
[1:44:53] fullness, God sent a prophet to put the
[1:44:56] church in order that all the gifts must
[1:44:59] wait for their time because the church
[1:45:02] has come to fullness. We are no longer
[1:45:05] children where you know someone is
[1:45:07] talking and the other person is talking
[1:45:08] there. I mean as children do that you
[1:45:12] have to bear with them you know that
[1:45:13] they are
[1:45:14] kids sometimes it gets
[1:45:17] irritating and we have to let them know
[1:45:19] hey we are you know we are talking
[1:45:21] something here keep
[1:45:25] quiet but that's
[1:45:30] childishness but the church in this
[1:45:33] power thinking that uh you know they
[1:45:35] they have found favor with God they are
[1:45:37] manifesting the gifts
[1:45:40] But because they were not submitting to
[1:45:42] the
[1:45:43] word, because they were not submitting
[1:45:46] to the order of the
[1:45:49] word, they lost that place with
[1:45:53] God. Are we together?
[1:45:56] So seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:46:02] God and this
[1:46:05] righteousness and every other thing will
[1:46:07] be added. Every other thing. So seek you
[1:46:11] first the kingdom of God. We want the
[1:46:14] kingdom of God and we want everything
[1:46:16] that comes with the kingdom. All of his
[1:46:18] benefits. The way to get it is to submit
[1:46:22] to the principle of the kingdom.
[1:46:26] submit to the laws of the
[1:46:31] kingdom for us to get the benefit for us
[1:46:34] to enjoy the
[1:46:35] benefit. Are you are you are you with me
[1:46:38] tonight?
[1:46:40] Amen.
[1:46:44] So it's a it's a
[1:46:47] privilege. It's a privilege.
[1:46:53] I know many times you I mean you you
[1:46:56] hear that and but you know and then we
[1:46:58] you know uh uh uh you hear people say uh
[1:47:02] uh uh uh you know uh uh this person have
[1:47:06] to earn my
[1:47:09] submissiveness is it's is it's also a
[1:47:11] sign of lack of
[1:47:14] revelation because that's your power.
[1:47:18] It's your power that you
[1:47:23] have. You don't have to play it h uh you
[1:47:27] know as as a card to win. No, it's your
[1:47:30] power you have. When the church goes
[1:47:33] into submission, the angels are on
[1:47:36] guide. The power of God is around them
[1:47:40] to bring to pass what they want.
[1:47:46] Praise the Lord. Modi sent word to
[1:47:49] Esther and says, "What are you doing
[1:47:51] there? You know, your people are going
[1:47:53] to die and uh uh it was not her time to
[1:47:56] go before the king." But she submitted
[1:47:59] herself. If I die, let me
[1:48:02] die. That's what she
[1:48:07] said. She said, "Pray for
[1:48:10] me. I will be praying and I will go and
[1:48:13] submit myself to the king. If I die, let
[1:48:16] me
[1:48:19] die. And because she submitted herself
[1:48:23] to the council of Malachi, which was a
[1:48:26] righteous counsel, the angel of the Lord
[1:48:29] went on her behalf.
[1:48:34] When the king saw her, he never thought
[1:48:37] about the calendar. He never thought
[1:48:38] about the time of the day. Oh, it is not
[1:48:40] a time for you to come. He said, "What
[1:48:42] can I give you today?" half of my
[1:48:44] kingdom.
[1:48:49] Praise the
[1:48:51] Lord. That the the the the power of uh
[1:48:54] of of of uh uh the secret weapon of the
[1:48:57] church is submission. But sometimes we
[1:49:00] want to figure it
[1:49:02] out what is going to be the result. So I
[1:49:05] will do this and when I do this then
[1:49:07] this will
[1:49:10] happen. Sometimes the battery in our
[1:49:13] calculator is dull.
[1:49:16] Whatever battery we using is not
[1:49:18] working. It giving you the wrong
[1:49:20] number. Praise the Lord. Your calculator
[1:49:24] battery is dead. Throw it through the
[1:49:26] window.
[1:49:29] Amen. Stop calculating. Submit to the
[1:49:32] word and let God go on your behalf. If
[1:49:35] we want angels to fight our battle,
[1:49:37] let's submit to the word.
[1:49:41] Let's submit to the word. That's all you
[1:49:42] have to do.
[1:49:44] when when when you have a situation you
[1:49:47] are overwhelming instead of worrying and
[1:49:50] thinking how I would do it just submit
[1:49:52] to the word just submit to the word just
[1:49:56] start loving him more just start
[1:49:58] praising him more I appreciate you Lord
[1:50:01] and you get yourself out of that thought
[1:50:04] of
[1:50:06] worry because as long as that thought of
[1:50:08] worry is bogging your mind you are not
[1:50:12] submitting you and not
[1:50:15] submitting. It's a it's a place of
[1:50:18] complete
[1:50:20] surrender. It's a place of total
[1:50:23] abandon. You you just you abandon
[1:50:26] yourself. Like the Bible says cast your
[1:50:29] cares. It didn't say lay your tears
[1:50:32] down. It say cast it. Throw it.
[1:50:40] That's the power of the church to
[1:50:49] submit. Are we together? The Lord bless
[1:50:52] you. Musicians, you can
[1:50:55] come. Let's just uh take these few
[1:50:58] thoughts to the Lord in prayer. We trust
[1:51:01] and see how the Holy Ghost will help us.
[1:51:03] Amen.
[1:51:04] And uh let's bow our heads tonight.
[1:51:10] I don't know for what reason, but I just
[1:51:11] believe that maybe it was uh it was uh
[1:51:14] you know the grace of God. I was so out
[1:51:17] of fate on Sunday. I was so tired. I
[1:51:20] felt I felt
[1:51:21] exhausted and I think uh uh it was just
[1:51:30] uh Are you playing trust and obey? Yes.
[1:51:33] Let's just sing that. Let's sing that
[1:51:36] before we go to the Lord in
[1:51:39] prayer. Walk with the
[1:51:43] Lord in the light of his word. Oh, what
[1:51:50] a
[1:51:52] glory he shares on our way.
[1:52:00] Oh, why we do it good
