[8:56] right here we are in this condition we
[9:00] are
[9:01] today all of it going on like that in
[9:04] Israel how Ahab did a figurehead for
[9:07] Jezebel cuz he he was married to her
[9:11] America our leader how did our you know
[9:13] our leader was a rich man how many know
[9:15] that a
[9:17] multi-millionaire somebody told me in a
[9:19] magazine or some radio or television or
[9:21] something Jack Vinny or somebody made a
[9:24] Ernie forward I believe was somebody
[9:26] said that his father helped him get two
[9:29] states that he didn't
[9:31] own just about owns the rest of it how
[9:34] did he get
[9:35] it how did that money come through the
[9:38] whiskey traffic and
[9:41] liquor that's reason he dropped the
[9:43] taxes on Whiskey and stuff that's what
[9:46] made him a rich man the very thing that
[9:48] damned our nation the very thing that
[9:52] corrupted the minds of our people the
[9:54] thing that sent our boys to be drunkers
[9:56] and our girls to be prostitutes amen the
[9:59] money off of that made him a rich man
[10:01] the same thing that old jezz belel
[10:03] system the same thing that persecuted
[10:06] our people the same thing that Dr them
[10:09] out in romanism and burned them and
[10:11] pulled them apart and done everything to
[10:13] them the same blood of the MERS the
[10:15] Bible said is in
[10:18] her there they are married
[10:22] together and we Americans stagger right
[10:25] on oh well we got a few extra dollars
[10:28] and we're having a good time time better
[10:29] off in all the rest of the Nations but
[10:31] brother you just wait a
[10:32] minute let's take it letter by letter
[10:34] now for the next few minutes see what
[10:37] happened the preachers got right along
[10:39] his knck down with them went right on
[10:41] with them all the system the whole
[10:43] Israelite system went right on with
[10:45] jeel they had a farm yes and don't the
[10:49] Bible tell us that in this last days
[10:50] we'll have a farm of
[10:52] [Music]
[10:53] godliness all the prophecies are
[10:56] fulfilled
[10:57] brother we're at the end
[11:00] nationally we at the end spiritually we
[11:02] are at the end every system is at its
[11:06] end next thing is the coming of the Lord
[11:09] and the translation of the
[11:11] [Music]
[11:12] church God sent every sign Wonder done
[11:15] everything he could do trying to go
[11:17] people and constantly they move right on
[11:19] in look at this town here look at this
[11:22] country around
[11:23] here with tens of hundreds and hundreds
[11:26] of Pentecostal people
[11:29] and because of standing on Truth where
[11:31] they at this afternoon amen because
[11:34] someone told him not to cooperate with
[11:36] the meeting you poor
[11:40] deliberate God be merciful to you it's
[11:42] only thing I can
[11:44] saying when you Christians gotten a more
[11:48] backbone than
[11:50] that you got a wishbone instead of a
[11:53] backbone
[11:55] right what we need is preach the gospel
[11:59] with teeth in it that'll chop the thing
[12:01] to
[12:04] Pieces what just like the rest of them
[12:07] then you wonder why we holler about it
[12:09] then you see you get the cold shoulder I
[12:11] expect it I have
[12:12] to all this went on in Israel
[12:16] finally one day com stomping out of the
[12:20] Wilderness come an old hairy looking
[12:23] fell Elijah the
[12:26] tishbite he never come up out any their
[12:28] organizations come out of the
[12:31] Wilderness he had nothing to do with him
[12:33] he was a prophet of the
[12:35] Lord Brother he Shu that Jezebel Kingdom
[12:39] for everything was in
[12:40] [Music]
[12:43] it they hated him he had no cooperation
[12:47] I guarantee you that the Bible says
[12:51] not certainly he made them painted face
[12:56] Jezebels burn up I imagine
[12:59] he laid the ax to the root of the tree
[13:02] like John did the chips fall wherever
[13:04] there was you but he laid her in there
[13:07] he shut the
[13:09] nation showing that they were wrong in
[13:12] trying to call them back to a true
[13:14] Living God back to his word instead of a
[13:16] jezebel
[13:24] worship what did they do to the receive
[13:26] him they hated him
[13:29] but his word went forth just the same
[13:31] because he had thus sayeth the
[13:35] Lord God worked with him he showed he
[13:37] was anointed Prophet by the things that
[13:39] he said coming to pass and all that he
[13:41] did prove that he was God's
[13:43] Prophet but yet they would not believe
[13:46] it because he tore up their
[13:50] playhouses he told them that they were
[13:53] wrong Ahab was arrested about amen true
[13:58] and you notice
[13:59] they didn't believe
[14:01] him but he preached it just the same now
[14:04] the preachers agreed with him amen he
[14:07] said I'm the only ones left Lord look at
[14:09] him they won't even want nobody will
[14:11] cooperate but he had a mission to do and
[14:14] he did it he had the word of the Lord
[14:17] thus sayeth the
[14:19] Lord and he attacked in the nation he
[14:21] attacked in the church he attacked
[14:23] everything there was and God was with
[14:26] him we are promised in the last days
[14:29] that he will return to this country
[14:32] too I know Jesus when Matthew 17 when
[14:36] they asked him why the scribes say Elias
[14:38] watch what he said Elias truly must
[14:41] first come pack in the future
[14:45] tense but then he give John as an
[14:47] example John wasn't Malachi 4 John was
[14:50] Malachi 3 behold I send a messenger
[14:52] before me to prepare the way Malachi 4
[14:57] he said before the great and turrible
[14:59] day of the Lord shall come when all the
[15:00] Earth will be burned like a stubble
[15:02] before that day out send
[15:05] Elijah and it wasn't
[15:07] John because the Lord never burnt the
[15:10] earth when John came and if you notice
[15:13] in the end the last chapter of the last
[15:15] verse he said and he watch he talking
[15:19] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[15:22] the children and the hearts of the
[15:26] children to the fathers now watch the
[15:28] first John came the first Elijah what
[15:30] did he do he came and brought a message
[15:34] and turned the old Orthodox hard Hearts
[15:37] to the faith of the young Church the
[15:39] children but when the next Elijah comes
[15:42] in the end time he's to go back and take
[15:44] the the father's
[15:46] Hearts the children's Hearts rather and
[15:48] turn them back to the faith of the
[15:50] Pentecostal
[15:52] fathers see the difference he'll not be
[15:55] one of these here so-call we have today
[15:58] he'll go right back back to Acts 2 and
[16:00] start right from now he'll preach the
[16:02] unadulterated gospel just say the same
[16:05] things that Peter did on the day of
[16:06] Pentecost because what he said on
[16:08] Pentecost has been decayed the rest of
[16:10] scriptures through you'll not twist
[16:12] around with some organization when
[16:14] Elijah comes he'll hate women like
[16:16] Elijah did just like or bad women just
[16:20] like John did you'll be a Wilderness
[16:22] lover just like they were you'll not
[16:24] spare we're looking for him to come
[16:26] he'll come God said he would and he'll
[16:29] be here I believe if anything the
[16:31] message that we got today will forerun
[16:33] that great coming of him yes
[16:35] [Music]
[16:37] sir and he's on his road already born
[16:40] like Elijah was and come busting out of
[16:42] the Wilderness somewhere he'll make he
[16:46] known he'll preach acts two he'll bring
[16:50] the faith of these old Pentecostal
[16:52] fathers right back to the the faith of
[16:55] these Pentecostal children right back to
[16:56] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[16:59] he'll go right back to Acts 2 acts 238
[17:02] all down through he'll bring the real
[17:04] unadulterated gospel he'll not have
[17:06] anything to do with Jezebel and her
[17:08] system you'll be a servant of
[17:11] God sure will the Bible said he would
[17:15] come he'll prophesy and bust his message
[17:19] in the face of these Jezebels just
[17:21] exactly like Elijah did in the beginning
[17:23] to Israel they all hate him they won't
[17:26] cooperate with him no no
[17:30] he'll come God promised it and he'll
[17:33] arise on the
[17:36] scene he'll he'll preach to the elected
[17:39] church as he said he would shaking that
[17:42] elect shaking the carnish off of it the
[17:44] the world and things shaking it down
[17:46] Bing it down getting a church together
[17:48] of people I know you say that's my
[17:50] denomination brother you're
[17:53] wrong John came as a Onan system
[17:59] introduce a one man Jesus
[18:01] Christ and the Elijah will not be a
[18:04] system it'll be a man Jesus said
[18:09] so it'll be one man that's anointed of
[18:13] the Holy Ghost and he won't introduce
[18:15] any three or four Gods he'll introduce
[18:17] one the Lord Jesus
[18:20] Christ because his message will shake
[18:22] the
[18:23] Pentecostal children back to the faith
[18:25] of the fathers again
[18:33] you remember brother I say these things
[18:36] to be nasty I need to be at the altar
[18:38] I'm telling you thus sayith the Lord God
[18:42] hasn't Vindicated I've told you the
[18:43] truth around the nation around the world
[18:46] then tell me where the mistake
[18:48] was I'm telling you the truth get back
[18:51] to God
[18:53] quickly get out of these
[18:55] systems cu the Bible said in the book of
[18:58] re ations that the Roman Catholic
[19:00] hierarchy was a and she was a
[19:03] mother of
[19:04] Harlot what is that Church's
[19:07] systems and where did the Methodist
[19:09] Church where did the Lutheran Church
[19:10] come from where did the Methodist
[19:12] Baptist where did all organizations come
[19:15] from God never did organize a
[19:19] Church Catholic Church said they begin
[19:21] back there with Jesus organized the
[19:23] church I want I want the page in history
[19:26] or the page in the Bible there never was
[19:29] an organization for 306
[19:31] years at the death of the last
[19:34] Apostle then they formed the United City
[19:37] Council and made an
[19:38] organization and when Luther came out he
[19:41] was a great man of God but as soon as he
[19:42] left that little group of people went
[19:44] over and formed another organization
[19:46] then the Holy Spirit went out on John
[19:48] wesle he never organized anything but
[19:49] after he left then they organized then
[19:52] the Holy Ghost come in the Pentecostals
[19:53] and they went out from the Methodist and
[19:55] what happened then they organized
[19:58] but there will be a on man system come
[20:01] forth with the power and the anointing
[20:03] of Elijah to fulfill
[20:05] the
[20:07] Hallelujah he'll shake
[20:10] it and remember he prophesied to him and
[20:13] prophesied and told him all the things
[20:14] and God worked with him but his final
[20:17] message was attacked on the White
[20:21] [Music]
[20:24] House when John came his final message
[20:28] was attacked on the White House of that
[20:32] day Elijah's final message when he
[20:34] walked down that road that morning after
[20:37] being in the presence of God out there
[20:39] walk down that road with old hairs all
[20:41] over him the bald head shining the
[20:43] whiskers blowing them little eyes it's
[20:45] gleaming with the glory of God that's
[20:47] sticking his hand his feet just as study
[20:50] as they could
[20:51] be what's he doing walking right down
[20:54] from samarra into the presence of the
[20:56] White House and saying thus sayith the
[21:00] Lord fearing nothing the churches have
[21:03] turned him down the people turned him
[21:05] down so now he's given his final attack
[21:08] upon the White
[21:11] House then what happened after that
[21:15] [Music]
[21:18] listen after that attack his voice
[21:22] became quiet nobody heard him no more
[21:25] God called him off the scene
[21:28] that Elijah you've done Maj your message
[21:31] KN to all of Israel they know what I
[21:34] come up here in the wilderness get away
[21:37] from them separate yourself because I'm
[21:40] going to do something I'm going to show
[21:42] them what it is to turn my message
[21:44] down what's set in war famine
[21:49] starvation thus sayith the Holy
[21:53] Spirit watch what's coming watch what's
[21:55] going to
[21:56] follow that was the f
[21:59] famine there will be a
[22:02] famine oh maybe not for bread but for
[22:05] hearing the word of God and is truth all
[22:08] the churches will socialize and go right
[22:09] on into it just the same like they've
[22:11] already been swallowed up with
[22:13] it what did Elijah do he found a Hidden
[22:19] Spring Way up in the
[22:21] mountain where he got some Water of
[22:24] Life Divine Revelations from God is he
[22:27] set up there under the power power of
[22:29] God the revelations get a little Hidden
[22:31] Spring while the rest of them was
[22:34] famishing God bless his servants them
[22:37] Ravens they brought him something to
[22:40] eat while he was isolated from the
[22:43] people and they were down there
[22:45] famishing for Revival and all going on
[22:48] don't hear no more of his revivals that
[22:50] where is that old crank he goes around
[22:52] blasting our organization where's he at
[22:54] now they didn't
[22:57] know he pulled himself with God out into
[23:00] a isolated place where they didn't hear
[23:02] his voice then they begin to see when
[23:05] God sends forth a message and tells the
[23:07] people and they don't receive it then he
[23:08] withdraws his servant and sends his
[23:11] pledge

[23:24] you think you've seen something you just
[23:25] wait after a while you haven't se seen
[23:28] nothing you think we were dying for a
[23:30] good spiritual Revival you wait till
[23:31] after a b you just wait long and cry to
[23:36] hear the word of God the Bible said so
[23:39] there will be a famine in the last days
[23:40] said the prophet not for bread and water
[23:43] alone but for hearing the true word of
[23:46] God but that voice will be quiet in the
[23:49] wilderness somewhere get
[23:51] away he ordained the Ravens his
[23:55] servants bless them Birds he his
[23:58] servants that kept the voice of of
[24:00] Elijah alive during the time of his
[24:03] isolation from the
[24:05] church the Ravens brought him flesh and
[24:08] bread at morning and flesh and bread in
[24:10] the evening and he drank from the little
[24:11] Fountain while the rest of them down
[24:13] there were doing without any spiritual
[24:15] food and
[24:18] water then one
[24:20] day after sin had tuck its toll and God
[24:24] brought his people to their
[24:26] knees Jezebel took every
[24:28] everything she wiped it all up and
[24:31] she'll do it again that's thus sayth
[24:35] God's holy
[24:37] Bible she'll do it

[25:19] moved him he had no revivals he preached
[25:22] not against nothing he just stood up
[25:24] there with God Alone out in the
[25:25] wilderness cuz he's a Wilderness man

[25:31] John raised in the wilderness he went
[25:34] out in the wilderness alone with God
[25:36] tuck away from the church after he give
[25:37] his message and the church turned it
[25:39] down turned it down and fr of the
[25:40] organization wouldn't do nothing so he
[25:41] just had to move out God called him off
[25:43] the scene tuck him on out in the
