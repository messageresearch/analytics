Bible study tonight just to be able to place ourselves in the in the word in the scriptures in John chapter 1. let's text in John chapter one and then we go running tonight praise the Lord it's in John chapter one if if I can if I can be in the message of an hour tonight that would be good and in the message of the hour but if I can be in the message of an hour tonight praise the Lord it's in John chapter one let's just read verse 1. 23 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the world was gone the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made let's pray together father we are approaching your internal word and Lord God we pray that father the internal thoughts Behind these words we spring out tonight and be a blessing to us mention I live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God Lord father we just want to thank you for another time that we can come in Fellowship around your word father we want to live the tonight bless them Father God and we also who prayed in as your your blessing also on sister Bridget after her doctor visited today and uh and precious Lord all the needs that are in our gates we just want to thank you for the ones that are now with us tonight and that are streaming into the service law the hearts here we pray that you will bless them Father oh God as we have as we are about to enter into your word we just pray that father God you will you will capture us the holy spirit is a capturing power just capture us tonight father Lord that's uh that's the best way we can be fair of day when you get our attention so we pray that father Lord you will bless us now we love you we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed praise the Lord you may have your seed okay I know I had a praise report here Shalom Saints I want uh to use this opportunity to thank you all for your prayers while I was away I also bring greetings from my dad brothers and sister-in-law their sister Bureau so we thank the Lord for granting our sister a safe travel and so on Sunday we were talking about uh the reproach of the word we were talking about a reproach of the word we were taking our inspiration from the message reproach for the cause of the word so uh and what we were trying to show is the other is because we are we are bearing the word that's the reason why we have been reproached praise the Lord that's that's the picture I want us to get whatever whatever is the devil that is reproaching Us by trials and and different things all it is scoffers that are mugging us because of our Word of Life our address and whatever it is the reason why we have been reproached is because God has called us to bear his word praise the Lord I want us to grab that picture and then we will read a quote here from the message reproach for the course of the word that's what I would take my my thoughts from tonight and uh that's what I would take my thoughts from tonight and I think sister Naisha mom and Anne supposed to be traveling tomorrow so we would like to keep them in our prayers their flight is set for tomorrow evening and I think they are giving IRA and his wife some support before they head out so let's let's look into that tonight if our Tech Team can just put up their code that we want to I want to I want to use there to be for us to be able to create uh the focus tonight brother Branham says here he says Jesus reproach for the word Jesus reproach for the word so that they use their phrase to be my message tonight Jesus reproached for the word so what I want to do with this thought is to separate Jesus from the word Jesus reproach for the word he was reproached for the word because he was bearing the word he was the vessel that the word was in that's the reason why he was reproached praise the Lord amen so in the beginning was the word that's what we read that's what the scripture says that's what we believe in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the world was God so uh as as you as we look at that thought tonight you can take each of those phrase and break it down and then it helped us to be able to see the the steps that the word went from one to the other we were not we will not take all of the time on that tonight but what I want for us to do like I said and uh uh so we will see here that uh the Bible says in the beginning back again was the word the word was with God the world was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so let's go to First collusion I mean sorry no first collusion there is no first solution there is just only one amen let's go to the book of collusion and there should be right after our book of Philippians that will help us to be able to grab our thoughts tonight let's read from verse 12. mm-hmm chapter 1 from verse 12 giving thanks unto the father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the sins in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins amen am I am I reading from the right place did I told you something different amen who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature Christ is the mystery of God revealed Brothers this is where brother Branham took his uh his teaching from portion of his teaching this brings us back to Saint John chapter 1. and it take us back to Genesis chapter 1. praise the Lord in the beginning was the word now Paul yet is making us to understand in verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God so uh uh the invisible God the invisible spirit talk a form praise the Lord so in the beginning was the word Thy Word was the form of the invisible God it was the image of the invisible God and that word image as I was studying it it came out a beautiful year I was looking at that it comes from a Greek war a Greek word that is spelled e-i-k-o-n their original form from which it is drawn not merely a thing it resembled it's too different praise the Lord the original form from which it is drawn not merely uh I think it resemble now the reason why I took that was because on Sunday we were showing uh the difference between reflecting and resembling praise the Lord so the the image of their invisible God is not a form of resemblance it's a form of reflecting are we together praise the Lord I'm trying to I'm trying to get you I see you a bit spread out in uh in in your mind not not where you are sitting but you are you are spread I'm trying to I'm fishing out for your spirit tonight amen so the the the who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature praise the Lord so the invisible God hard to give birth have to bring forth that's where that image is he was drawn from himself amen he came from an invisible God and now he becomes he took a form called the word called the logos he took a form as a body of light are we together for by him where all things created so it goes back to Saint John chapter 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the world was God and by him you know he made all things so Paul is here using their very same thought for by him were all things created that is in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether there be trans Dominion principalities all powers now you you look at this word principality it has also to do with every evil spirit every Power are we together praise the Lord so just like how we were created for a purpose the evil Powers were also created for the purpose are we together they are all subject onto the Creator all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things can say so we go back to that and uh taking the word image Also let's uh look back in Saint John chapter one let's look at verse 18. it's in John chapter 1 let's look at verse 18. Verse 18 John will Express yet he said no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he have declared so the image of the invisible God was just declaring so once again it's not a resemblance it's a reflection amen because that's what you do with light when the place is dark you you turn the light on to declare what is there the life will show what is there are we together praise the Lord now so so uh uh Jesus brother banham said Jesus reproach for the word he goes ahead he said Jesus was reproached for the word Lord here how could he stand the reproach when he was the Divine incarnate God he was God himself made flesh praise the Lord amen so that's what we want to follow tonight he says Jesus reproach for the word so we look up there from the beginning and then we want to come year in Luke chapter 3. Luke chapter 3 let's read the uh praise the Lord Luke chapter 3 let's read from verse 21. Luke chapter 3 reading from verse 21. now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that Jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was open and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven we said thou our mind beloved Son in D I am well pleased praise the Lord amen I'm well pleased as chapter 10 keep there in your mind the descending of the Holy Ghost in the in the bodily ship and see what the apostle was said in Acts chapter 10. let's take Acts chapter 10. now there was the same look that wrote that but he expressed it here in another way you will soon grab the picture where we're going we'll build it and then we will preach praise the Lord as chapter 10 let's look at verse 38. as chapter 10 verse 38. okay as chapter 10. verse 38 the Bible says how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power when was he anointed from the scripture that we have just read in Luke when was Jesus Anointed with the Holy Ghost praise the Lord I didn't hear anybody say anything I just said praise the Lord so you can answer me and he said praise the Lord because I agree with you I didn't hear what you said when was Jesus Anointed with the Holy Ghost after baptism he was anointed with the Holy Ghost in power so you will see here that Jesus in the beginning was the word I want to hold my place here so so what we are looking at is the other Jesus was born the word amen what word was born the Virgin shall conceive that was Jesus that was the word esta shall rise out of Jacob that was a word that Balaam said the Sea of the woman will bruise the serpent head that was the word amen that word was before Jesus the star rise out of Jacob it was a word before Jesus a virgin shall conceive he will be called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God that word the Isaiah spoke was before Jesus are we together praise the Lord now so all that promised word the angel Gabriel will now take all of their promises that were speaking about the Messiah to find a virgin and speak the word to thy virgin are we together amen the reason why Jesus was not born is seen because he was called the seed of the woman meaning that the woman will have a seed with no man the reason why he was not and he was not born in sin because uh uh the seat of the woman tying it with the Virgin shall conceived is the same are we together now so that word that was spoken by the prophets all the promises the law of God shall raise up a prophet like me that was a word that Moses spoke amen it was a promise you remember when that when the Pharisees went to to meet John the Baptist they says are you Elias he said no this is are you the Messiah he said no they said are you that Prophet which prophet they were talking about the one that Moses spoke of so you see all of those promises now form that word was now formed in marriage praise the Lord a former body and that has birth the angel said He Shall be Called Jesus because he will do what oh let's talk people let's talk let's talk let's talk let's talk let's talk let's talk let's talk praise the Lord let us not be your friend if we were taking quests there would be nobody here that will Mark the paper only God in heaven praise the Lord he will be called Jesus because he will save his people from their sin Jesus meaning Joshua Jehovah savior so that word that was forming Mary now was named Jesus are we together amen so he was born the word the word he was born the word because there's a promise that was hanging over him praise the Lord but for that word now to get in power for that word to for to to to fulfill what it was promised it needed to be anointed amen praise the Lord so Luke tells us there that when Jesus was baptized the heaven opened and uh and and and and the the the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily ship that's what brother Branham will warn us that you cannot make Jesus his own father The Mystery of the godhead praise the Lord is rightly placed in the scripture if you just go with one God as your one finger you will get the whole thing wrong right but because that one God took on flesh that one God has many forms of manifestation and the reason why I'm bringing it like this because just like Jesus had a word that brought him forth you had a word that brought you forth the word that brought Jesus forth had to be anointed for it to get in place and until the word that brings you forth is Anointed we will you will just play Church you would just play Church you were just play religion praise the Lord there was a word that brought him forth the Virgin shall conceive the star of Jacob the woman see we can go we can go on and on through the Old Testament we can we can we can pick it up year and day right are we together now you see that's the reason why he could bear the reproach he says for this cause I was born he could bear the reproach why because he identified the word on a wish he was born he identified the promise on the wish he was born are we together you will only be able to Bear the reproach of the world for your day if you are not just joining a church but you have identified the word praise the Lord are we together because there is a word that is bringing forth a bride just like the word brought for Christ the church cannot bring forth the bride amen the church can bring something that looks like the bride but the church cannot bring the bride so no matter what church you go praise the Lord no matter what church you go it can be called whatever name Genesis or Exodus and pillow of fire or whatever name you want to call it your church cannot bring for the bride believe in brother Branham asked the messenger of the age cannot bring forth the bride and we have to take the word the same way the word brought the bridegroom it would be the word that will bring the bride are we together are you seeing the picture praise the Lord that's the reason why you you you you you can you can put your religious strength to bed and bed and bed and bed but then it gets in a place where you throw in the towel I can bear this animal I'm tired the world never brought you forth if the word brings you forth it will keep you it will sustain you praise the Lord are we together are you seeing the picture can I preach now okay so yeah uh uh Luke is bringing it out in in in the the eyes of the Apostle year where he's he's making us to see that that word verse 37 he said that word I say ye no which was published throughout all Judea and and begin From Galilee after the baptism wish John preached how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost the one that's hid this scripture they don't like it but it's truth and many wonders in the message don't like this scripture because the thing that you are taking something from Jesus when you read this scripture praise the Lord when you see if you don't if we don't understand our sonship because from the first Psalm that God brought forth from the beginning Genesis chapter one that's the way he's bringing for all his sons all his sons are coming by the word now you that's that's the reason why you can't take your sensation you can take your experience it has to be the word nothing but the word because you can have a vision today it is only for today and it might not sustain you praise the Lord the gifts are not over the word amen your experiences are now over the world are we together okay so let's let's travel now we see a little bit here we just wanted to build this picture see what brother Branham sharing before we go we've been playing this message that's our uh uh Sunday school tip message will be in plain who is this let's let's read this one listening to this now he says here now the difference between him who him Jesus amen the difference between Jesus as a son in you as a son the difference between Jesus as a Son of God and you as a son and daughter of God there is a difference that's why we want to see let's look at that difference he says see he was at the beginning their word amen but that beginning that he was at the word he was not called Jesus praise the Lord you were at the beginning in thought form you were in the mind of God never thought about you when you were born he thought about you from the foundation of the word are we together he was at the beginning the word in my feet a body he came in and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek are we together praise the Lord we never heard no more of my kisses because he became Jesus Christ but later on praise the Lord amen later on he took different forms Through the Ages that's the reason why the Bible says The Only Name giving among men so it was that were taking on human name The Only Name giving and more men whereby we are safe the only human name so the word took on a human name when he was called Jesus Christ are we together praise the Lord you were we were always there from the mind of God but it was when our mama was conceived with us that he started thinking on a name to call us amen your name was not before you you were before your name are you seeing the picture so that's the difference between him as his son and you as a son he says Melchizedek was that priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that you bypass that but for for for for for Jesus Christ he descended he came from one form to another Pillar of Fire by Night pillar of cloud by day the angel that met Moses in a burning bush the captain of the Lord host that met Joshua he came from one form to another form until finally he took a human name but you bypass all of that amen praise the Lord you never came from one form God kept you for laodisha you are not in episode Church age amen praise the Lord he kept you to express you in a time of our teachers so you bypass that but now with Jesus right from the mind in the beginning all things were made by him then he became the Tree of Life in the in the in the garden amen then from there he took another form the seed of the woman honor a promise praise the Lord amen and then he took another form with with uh with uh uh no one and then with Abraham and then uh with Moses and and you were just Discerning descending descending descending descending but we never came that way we were kept for this age for this period for this purpose we were born for this time time like this are we together so is God a point a word for this age now you will appreciate this when we when we look look at some few things here so he says now you bypass that because in their form he knew all things praise the Lord that's why Jesus could say before Abraham was I am amen so when that word that talked all the different from got into a body system element that could be hungry that could sleep it still has the same quality of knowing the beginning are we together amen if we who have come that way we will just be the same because in their form he knew all things and you have never been able to know that yet you don't even know what's going to happen right after the service we want to know that his grace brought us here we enjoy the word and his grace will take us back home praise the Lord are we together are you getting the picture we are talking about sonship we are talking about the way God did with us when we when you understand that then nothing bother you so much you you get bothered but not so much amen you are like Adam praise the Lord he says like Adam like me you became from the attribute toward the flesh to be tempted we will not express all true we came right from the thought directly to the flesh are we together now so just like Jesus I promise you that I want to be uh message of an hour tonight just like Jesus came under a promised word the seed of the woman the start of Jacob Emmanuel God With Us in all of those promise we also came on a promise word praise the Lord so let me let me let me say like this uh ask chapter 15 let's go to Acts chapter 15. we uh we will use this verse to establish something now this was in the Jerusalem Council verse 13 let's read and after they have held their peace James answer saying men and brethrens yaking unto mean Simon Simon Peter has declared how God are the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for what praise the Lord I want for us to read that together amen Simon have declared how God are the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name so what what is the promise for the Gentiles a bearer of his name yeah praise the Lord our promise is to bear his name the reason why God will visit the Gentiles the reason why God will save us we that that were that were not in the Commonwealth of God uh alienated away from God uh the reason there is that we will be a bearer of his name now you if you go back to the scripture this is where this is the part that I love I'm telling you I'm telling you you enjoy it I love this part praise the Lord I love this part the reason why I love this is because everything that God will do in dealing with us the way he deal with us the reason why he protected us the reason why he provide for us is because of his name praise the Lord is because of his name then you go back and see that in the Ten Commandments they turned off the Ten Commandments God told the children of Israel do not take my name in vain praise the Lord that is more than just swearing that is here more than just Jesus that is more than that now so God is going to show how he treasure his name praise the Lord and if God treasure his name oh man he says it's getting beautiful I don't know if you're grabbing the picture but I'm beginning to see it and I love it I beginning to see it and and and and I appreciate it praise the Lord now you see how precious Redemption is to God because if God will give Israel his people all the laws and all the ordinance you know and build the entire picture Through the Ages with Israel and the Jews and you know he built all those pictures but for you and myself amen that now he was he were coming and express his love to us just because of his name praise the Lord Hallelujah that's the best part of it amen that is the best part of it because uh I mean uh other you sisters you you know well you know you you can uh uh you you have your daddy's name and then you get married you can change your name and even you young guys yeah yeah I mean if you don't like your daddy name it sounds like my own name you can you can change your name and look for some kind of offensive name praise the Lord but when a woman takes a man name in Maori you stop to it praise the Lord you don't have that right like you have before you get married to change your name I mean I mean even if a guy named sounds ugly only because I don't want that ugly name I really like the guy but I just didn't like the name my goodness I couldn't bear being caught foreign that one came from but as I would look for one one name that I can't even pronounce yes very interesting yeah it gets very very interesting and and that's word I want us to see that that is the promise that is hanging over us you see that is the reason why God had to bring us to this place to understand the mistrate of history for purpose praise the Lord that is the reason why a God has to restore the the the the the the the true form of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ because the promise that was hanging over uh the rest of the people of the word because it's the rest of the people of the world that were now born under the abrahamic Covenant the people the rest of the people of the world that was now born to the children of Jacob are called the Gentiles are we together amen we are all under that Gentile group amen Samaritans only comes in a picture because it's a gentile and Jew mix are we together praise the Lord so let's let's start to appreciate here that there's there's a lot of few scriptures here we could read but let's look at this one first Samuel chapter 12. first Samuel chapter 12 Jesus how the word hanging over him the Virgin shall conceive the start of Jacob the woman's seed he had that word that was the word that that brought him forth amen you also have a promise hanging over you you can play the church you can dress you can get the church dress code you can speak the language of the message you can do everything but if our life does not come up to the standard that we are living for his namesake and whatever we are doing we are doing it for his namesake now for the church namesake now for the message namesake before his namesake because that is the promised word that will bring forth the bride so you can dress the message you can drink the message you can sleep the message that's the reason why you cannot replace his name with the prophet name that's the promise that will bring that's the promise that will bring the bride that is the promise that God will Quicken in this hour that's why Paul would say let everything that name the name of Christ depart from sin amen are we together first Samuel chapter 12 that's what I said I think I'm doing good here and I will also not be I would not struggle to confess if I pass the time first Samuel chapter 12 . let's read from verse 20 listening to this this beautiful beautiful part of the scripture that says that's what I love I I enjoy that tonight amen I don't know about you but I'm just having a good mighty good time I'm just having a matter of good time first Samuel chapter 12. oh I'm in second Sammy sorry I'm in second son boy it's first Samuel don't go to Second it's first Samuel I'm in second time I'm at the wrong place you stayed in first Samuel chapter 12. let's read from verse 20. and then just follow the reading there and see how beautiful and Samuel said unto the people fear not you have done all this wickedness yeah turn that aside from following the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart and turn your net aside foreign things which cannot profit non-deliver for they have been for the Lord will not forsake his people for his what praise the Lord oh I want you to yell that amen because that's your promise you better start loving it you better start loving it and start putting it on your lip I cannot do this for God namesake praise the Lord for the Lord will now forsake his people for what his great name's sake because it have pleased the Lord to make you his people the only reason why yeah see see what the way Samia said you have done all this wickedness but let me warn you there's a secret behind it fear the lord fear the lord because there is one reason why God will not flush you down the drain because he has attached his name to you for his name's sake praise the Lord are we together let's look at Psalm 106. I just took few scriptures tonight because I wanted to stay in an hour psalm 106. so we don't have anything to do with your natural birth they don't have anything to do with one family you are born in you don't have anything to do what tribe what nation you are from they don't have anything to do with you if God will achieve anything in your life it's not because of what you have done so when you think you are better than other people then you better be careful are we together Psalm 106 let's read verse seven now brother Branham will use this that's the very scripture where he used to preach the message God being misunderstood and what brother Branham was bringing out of that message is that we all misunderstand God just like the children of Israel misunderstood God praise the Lord we think it's about church amen we think it's about us when it's not because of us praise the Lord when it's not because of us you think about it Akon stole the Babylonian government and God says get rid of him his entire house now if God would have done that to my great-grandfather that smoked a pipe I will not be here just get rid of him the entire group that comes from there get rid of them if you have done it to Adam he would just close the book go back and be an eternal spirit are we together so brother Branham is I read this in in in in teaching the message God Be Misunderstood let's let's go ahead there verse 7. our father on us to Matt that wanders in Egypt we also don't understand God grace to us amen we think God grace is our good diet right praise the Lord Our Father understood that wonders in Egypt they remember that the multitude of thy mercy but provoke him are the sea even at the Red Sea but it still did not stop God he opened the sea and still allow those people that provoking to us to walk on the very seat are we together nevertheless he saved them for he saved them for sounding a little better praise the Lord he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known praise the Lord amen now so you see when brother Branham said Moses gave God a better idea no if you want to really look at it Moses pick it up and God was pleased with it when Moses said what will the nation say about you God says that's exactly what I was thinking about he pick up the thoughts of God and it pleased God because everything that God was doing was for his name's sake oh I'm feeling mighty good amen I will go to bed tonight and I would just have a good sleep because for his name's sake he will watch over me he gave his beloved sleep for his namesake you will give me another day tomorrow for his namesake and that's the reason why we are conscious of what we do amen we are conscious if it is not going to bring glory to his name don't do it because he spared your life for his namesake and why should you why should you live and pollute the name of God you'll be taking the name of God in vain the Bible says Thou shalt not take the name they didn't I shall not say the name thou shall not take the name when God placed his name upon you don't walk about it in vain places right nevertheless he saved him for his name's sake he saved us by grace for his name's sake because he said he will get a people from the Gentiles praise the Lord and that's the reason why we are baptized in his name that's the reason why whatever we do in words are these we do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you love the Lord tonight let's look at Jeremiah chapter 14. Jeremiah chapter 14. if you are looking at the time it says brother one will not really make it praise the Lord you are right I will not really make it praise the Lord uh let's let's just take Jeremiah having two two other scriptures here the last one is very is very very good so I will not just close the Bible but let's look at Jeremiah chapter 14. Jeremiah chapter 14 look at verse 7. Oh Lord though our iniquity testified against us do thou aid for thy name's sake for our backslidings and many we have sinned it against thee praise the Lord Ezekiel chapter 20. Ezekiel chapter 20. praise the Lord are we together you've seen the picture praise the Lord because if if you you get to the place in in and you you grab that understanding and and see what what is what is there that is is the word you know God is bringing forth his word now in Ezekiel chapter 20 that's what I said is that what I said yes let's read from verse 5. Ezekiel chapter 20. reading from verse 5. and said unto them thus said the Lord God in the days when I choose Israel and lifted up my hand onto the seed of the House of Jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt so he's going back now in the land of Egypt just like David said they never understood when God was doing all of those things turning the water into blood you know all of that they never understood it praise the Lord they just thought that Moses was trying to make something of himself but God was doing all of that to live her lift up his name before the Egyptians that you cannot compare me with the god of Egypt God was lifting up his name and the journey all they were thinking is that this this Moses he shouldn't play with us this time the first time he did it he ran away he must not try this time we ourselves would grab him and kill him yeah praise the Lord and I wanna if many times we don't misunderstand the things that God is doing why he allows certain things praise the Lord so he go he's going right back there to the house of Jacob in Egypt when I lifted up my hands unto them saying I am the Lord your God verse six in the day that I lifted up my hands unto them to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that that I had aspired for them flooring with milk and honey which is the glory of all Lanes then say I don't to them cast yet away every man the abomination of his eyes and Define that thyself with the idol Idols of Egypt I am the Lord your God but they rebelled against me and will not hacking unto me they did not Every Man cast away their Abominations of the eyes amen why because those idols took a hold of their heart that's why they kept looking back to Egypt they might not have it in their back maybe when they came across the Red Sea some of them make effort yeah yeah that's true we are gone they throw it in the sea but it will stay in their heart but they Rebellion against me verse 8 and will not take it unto me they did not every man Cast Away the abomination of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt then I said I will pour out my forehead upon them to accomplish my anger against him in the midst of the land of Egypt but I wrote for my namesake praise the Lord that I should not be polluted before so you see this now explain that conversation of Moses amen God said for my name's sake I will have there with them I would have wept them up before my namesake right because I will not pollute my name before the headings and that's exactly what Moses was saying what would the nation say about you if you do this praise the Lord do you think that Moses could suggests a better idea when God cannot learn but he just pick up the mind of God amen and it pleased God so you just think about it Moses just caught a shadow of it when he said that it was just a revelation it was an inspiration just a shadow right for time there are many a lot of verses down here we who have read God repeated that over and over you you just take the time to read chapter 20 you will see how he repeated that over I was going to do this to them but for my namesake they came they complained I was going to do it but for my namesake Ezekiel chapter 36 let's take this last one and then we will close and go to the Lord in prayer tonight but bam said just like the the the star that Moses had before pharaoh he says that's how the name of Jesus is in the church amen where two are three two or three I gather in my name he says I will be there praise the Lord Hallelujah he keeps it his appointment because we are coming together in his name we are not coming together just to please ourselves we are coming together in his name Ezekiel chapter 36 let's read from verse 16. it's it's a counter for lengthy reading but let me give you the picture this word you will find a scripture when God says that the a new heart and a new spirit where I give you amen I will take away the Stony heart and I would put my spirit now the reason why he's doing it that's what he will explain you I'm doing that because for my namesake because I want my name to be reflected through your life that's why I will give you the Holy Ghost I'm not giving you the Holy Ghost because you fast and prayed praise the Lord is because I want my name that's the reason why I'm going to take your selfish nature I'm going to take that stubborn spirit because I want you to be a vessel that I can reflect my name through so you see the church word put it on because we fast and pray that's why the Revival came because we we lay down before the Lord and that's the reason why it don't last because when we do it it has an aspiring date to it but when God comes behind it and do it for his namesake and we identify that is because of his name then it humble us we don't take no Pride we don't take no praise we walk humble before the Lord we say like Mary be it unto me according to that word that God will look my way praise the Lord that God will take a a a a a lust for demons or a a stubborn habit away from me but sometimes people cherish their own nature praise the Lord it's almost like a blind man regretting wow yeah I mean I regret that God gave me sight praise the Lord sometimes that's the way we behave because we wish that we will stay in those All Flesh and those all nature we do everything to revive it we we look for every little occasion to revive it so that's that's the background of of uh of Ezekiel 36 year verse 16. will raise moreover thou son of man take the one stick and write upon it for Judah and for the and for the children of Israel His companion then take another stake now he's going to he's going to do all of this and and you see that he's addressing it to the house of Israel he's addressing it to the the sons of Jacob are we together the name of the Lord is a strong tower the mighty run into it I mean uh and they are safe amen so when you understand that that that is the promise that is hanging over your life a people that will be the bearer of his name now brother Branham says something in uh in the message uh by faith Moses he says there are a lot of people that that build their own persecution sure they try to be fanatic for the word they try to misrepresent the word and say they are persecuting me he says if you if you put yourself in that place you will bear your own persecution praise the Lord and now that is the place also where it brings an understanding if you are persecuted for the word for sake then you will rejoice if you are complaining about it then you have to check what is the word or you have built it praise the Lord so like the prophet of God said yeah Jesus reproached for the word we can also say the bride reproach for the word we are we are reproached by scaffolds people that misunderstand why we live the way we live while we we dress the way we dress the things that we do amen praise the Lord even the demons the devils are also uh uh uh uh the the misunderstanders they wanna why can't we give up no we can because this body was redeemed amen he was baptized in Jesus name after after he has repented for all of his wrong law forgave him baptized in Jesus name and moreover God comes and and give you the Holy Ghost to empower you to be able to bear his name praise the Lord so you see the picture that's why we can bear his reproach musicians can come you can read the rest of the scriptures home and uh because as as we read things come up and then I want to emphasize and time is going so uh let's just let's just use this time and just meditate on what what what was ministered to us tonight praise the Lord let's just use this time while we sit and uh uh and just and just try to bring everything together tonight and and think about it as we go to the Lord in prayer let's just sing that song the name of the Lord is a strong towel but let us not let's not sing it as a praise song Let's just sing it as a worship song while we think think about it amen the Lord Has Lifted his name above us the name of the Lord is a strong time word oh the righteous running into [Music] the name of the Lord as strong a strong tower the righteous rock into and be I say the name of the Lord is oh yes the name of God Lawless as strong Towers the righteous run into and they are saying foreign [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord yeah blessed be the name of the Lord the Lord yes oh I thank you Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord the Lord Jesus is the

name of the Lord oh Jesus is the name of the Lord the long host what a musician plays softly now just listen to this I was reading from the wrong verse elim moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of Israel during their own land they defied it by their own ways and by their doing their ways was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman therefore our poor my forehead upon them for the blood that they have shared upon the land and fall their Idols where we they have polluted and I scattered them Among The Hidden and they were dispersed through the countries are calling to their ways and according to their doing I judged him and when they enter onto the headings whether they went they Pro free my holy name when they said to them Thou Art the people of the Lord and are gone forth out of his land but I have pity for my name I have pity for mining [Music] if God would deal with us but our iniquity there's no way we can stand before him but I have pity for my holy name which the house of Israel had profined among the healings whether they went therefore said unto the house of Israel tell them they'll say the Lord I do not this for your sake o House of Israel but for my holy namesake which year have profaned among the headings where you went [Music] and I will sanctify my great name [Music] which was profound among the healings which year have profaned in the midst of them and the hidden shall know that I am the Lord when they see you the very person that was living in Dumb and dirt when I sanctify my name and now you are living a decent life the hidden will say there is a living God because I know that man he used to be a wicked one I know that woman she used to live a wrong life but when I take you and I sanctify my name in you the healings will know that there is a living God oh I love this the hidden shall know that I am the law said I am the Lord said the Lord when I shall sanctify you before their eyes for I will take you from among the heathens I will gather you out of all the countries out of all the denominations out of all the churches I will bring you into your own land and I will sprinkle clean water upon you the watching of the Water by the word and years shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols or I claim you a new heart also will I give you the new spirit I will put within you and I will take you I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and then I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my status I won't give you a church doctrine and a church Creed I will put my spirit in you to cause you to walk in my status and you shall keep my judgment and do them in Asia dwell in the land that I give your
