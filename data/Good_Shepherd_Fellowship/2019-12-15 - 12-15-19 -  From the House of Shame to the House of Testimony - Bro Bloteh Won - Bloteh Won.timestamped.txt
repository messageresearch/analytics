[25:58] thank God knowing God that's something
[26:00] in your life it's good to give thanks
[26:02] and he's done so much to me and I just
[26:08] want to appreciate him for his grace for
[26:12] his mercy and most of all for what he
[26:15] did on Calvary he's given me deliverance
[26:18] of struggle with so many things struggle
[26:21] with fear so many many years he started
[26:25] when I was a little girl when my daddy
[26:29] passed away when I was a little girl and
[26:31] I didn't understand death and I seen him
[26:35] in the casket I looked I didn't know I
[26:37] thought he was just sleeping
[26:39] so nobody explained to me he's never
[26:41] come back and then after a week or so he
[26:44] didn't come back I asked when is daddy
[26:46] coming back my sister said he never
[26:49] asked again and I didn't understand so I
[26:52] went to this quiet being a kind of just
[26:58] quiet not wanting to explain not
[26:59] understanding everything but God has
[27:02] been faithful he's been so good through
[27:05] his word he has saved me he has set me
[27:08] free and the deliverance of God it
[27:10] didn't happen like instantly of land
[27:13] that is good to wait upon the Lord that
[27:16] when you hear that word I've learned
[27:18] that is another thing to hear and then
[27:20] start applying in your life sometimes
[27:23] you take a process and that's what
[27:24] happened to me it has taken a process of
[27:27] waiting I'm weak but he's strong I do so
[27:31] many wrong things but through Calvary I
[27:33] can always go back and say God forgive
[27:36] me I don't deserve anything but His
[27:39] grace has been shared sufficient to help
[27:42] me to raise the children is His grace to
[27:44] be this so I can say he's God who's
[27:47] faithful so I just want to say thank you

[1:04:55] Lord
[1:04:56] Genesis chapter 2 verse 25 let's read
[1:04:59] there this morning as we try to build a
[1:05:02] little foundation year of where we want
[1:05:04] to go talking about this subject praise
[1:05:09] the Lord
[1:05:13] Genesis chapter 2 verse 25 the Bible
[1:05:16] speaks you verse 24 therefore shall a
[1:05:23] man leave his father and his mother and
[1:05:26] shall cleave unto his wife and they
[1:05:29] shall be one flesh verse 25 and they
[1:05:34] were both naked the man and his wife and
[1:05:37] they were not ashamed amen you know why
[1:05:42] they were not ashamed because they were
[1:05:43] God conscious when a people when the
[1:05:49] people become God conscious they are not
[1:05:51] ashamed praise the Lord Amen but Branham
[1:05:57] who says there was a whole evil over
[1:05:58] their eyes thinking man's fetter that's
[1:06:01] what he said but it was because they
[1:06:03] were God conscious praise the Lord and
[1:06:07] then when we go over to Genesis chapter
[1:06:09] 3
[1:06:10] after the broke the Word of God then
[1:06:13] they became ashamed
[1:06:15] amen then it stands - found fig leaf to
[1:06:18] hide their shame and to hide their
[1:06:21] nakedness and then you know and and and
[1:06:24] and from that time that the the the
[1:06:27] human race were exposed to shame because
[1:06:32] they had become self-conscious
[1:06:34] no more God conscious they are started
[1:06:39] becoming self-conscious thinking about
[1:06:42] himself thinking about what this person
[1:06:44] thinking about me and thinking about
[1:06:46] what this person and trying to meet up
[1:06:48] with Arab
[1:06:49] thoughts and give everybody a better
[1:06:51] expectation of themselves a better
[1:06:53] feeling of themselves and all of that
[1:06:56] self self-conscious Amen praise the law
[1:07:02] but can you can you just imagine the
[1:07:05] scripture that we have just read
[1:07:08] steadying on there at a little bit last
[1:07:10] night and this King was was the king of
[1:07:18] honor you you have to remember now these
[1:07:21] these were the two nations that was more
[1:07:24] an Arnold from from the two daughters of
[1:07:27] lot so so these people somehow the word
[1:07:32] it will relate it to Israel praise the
[1:07:35] Lord because of the route of Abraham and
[1:07:39] lot now if you follow the scripture you
[1:07:44] realize in 1st Samuel chapter 11 First
[1:07:48] Samuel Chapter 11 that was worth saw the
[1:07:51] king got his first victory before he was
[1:07:55] anointed to be king in Israel amen and I
[1:08:00] mean after he have had that experience
[1:08:03] with with with saw and and he was faced
[1:08:08] with this battle with the children of
[1:08:10] the children of honor and then from that
[1:08:15] battle this king that David was singing
[1:08:20] a regard to after he passed took a very
[1:08:25] very strong hatred against all I want to
[1:08:28] be the background here so you can see
[1:08:30] what is happening you
[1:08:31] he took I mean he he had a saw for the
[1:08:34] way that saw slaughter his people praise
[1:08:39] the Lord now pretty soon David would
[1:08:43] start having problem with Saul and David
[1:08:46] will be on the run are we together
[1:08:51] First Samuel chapter 22 well now tell us
[1:08:56] that David as skipping from Saul he took
[1:09:02] his
[1:09:02] father and his mother because now you
[1:09:07] know all of these things of you know
[1:09:09] present politics were you know when when
[1:09:12] the leader this net you know he's net in
[1:09:15] favor of you your parents you know I
[1:09:18] also a target is it's being sent back
[1:09:21] there amen
[1:09:22] David had to now take his parents his
[1:09:26] brothers and his sisters that's what the
[1:09:28] scripture said that's that's over in
[1:09:34] First Samuel chapter 22 praise the Lord
[1:09:54] then he had that he choose to go and
[1:10:01] praise law amen
[1:10:09] verse one sitting David therefore
[1:10:11] departed thence and escaped to tudyk to
[1:10:15] the cave I belong in his brethren sin
[1:10:20] all his father's house heard it they
[1:10:25] went down Taylor to meet him and
[1:10:27] everyone and everyone that was in
[1:10:30] distress and everyone that was in depth
[1:10:34] see the kind of people that David was
[1:10:36] leading amen
[1:10:37] all of these people in distress in depth
[1:10:41] you know when and then just different
[1:10:44] things but year when you read down David
[1:10:48] now talk these people down over to the
[1:10:51] land of Honor and then he you know the
[1:10:55] king was able to receive him now so you
[1:10:57] just put the connection together now now
[1:11:00] this king he had problem with saw and
[1:11:04] because David and so is having problem
[1:11:08] now he can be able to accommodate amen
[1:11:22] so I want to get nine story together now
[1:11:29] David talk now I missing something here
[1:11:33] David talked his parents and his people
[1:11:35] down to the land of more now more of was
[1:11:39] the auto tribe from lost daughter now
[1:11:43] they were down there for a period of
[1:11:46] time okay my getting my story correct
[1:11:48] now it's over in second Samuel Chapter
[1:11:51] eight
[1:11:52] word the people know how to lead the
[1:11:56] land of Mora because the king of the
[1:11:58] land of Mora decided to revenge on the
[1:12:02] family of David now so there was there
[1:12:06] was I think two of the house of David
[1:12:09] and skip over to the land of Honor
[1:12:11] then there was where the friendship came
[1:12:13] between the the king of Honor and David
[1:12:18] now because he was able to open his
[1:12:21] doors when the king of Moore came on on
[1:12:26] his people so that was where the
[1:12:28] friendship was so David had a friendship
[1:12:32] with this King and then when the King
[1:12:35] passed away David decided now to send
[1:12:39] his men for them to go and and you know
[1:12:45] and sympathize the king is gone he now
[1:12:49] sent his men for them to go and
[1:12:51] sympathize with with the family with the
[1:12:54] nation go and represent Israel
[1:12:56] so his kindness over to these people
[1:13:00] praise the Lord Amen now so we realized
[1:13:05] here when David sent his men we saw
[1:13:08] water what a scripture told us there you
[1:13:12] know everybody knew David for being a
[1:13:14] man of war and you know the end and the
[1:13:17] things that he can do so these people
[1:13:21] just thought oh no you know David is its
[1:13:24] planning year to can for you know so do
[1:13:28] all the
[1:13:29] honor him so maybe this man that he has
[1:13:32] sent the adjuster spine and the
[1:13:34] scripture says there was the shave half
[1:13:37] of the abeer you know kind of a
[1:13:40] disfigured their face and and took their
[1:13:44] clothes their clothes their garment
[1:13:46] right to the backside and just tear it
[1:13:49] off and you know and just and just left
[1:13:54] them in that kind of a horrible
[1:13:55] condition praise the Lord embarrassing
[1:13:58] situation amen
[1:13:59] these were men you know the how wives
[1:14:02] and children just imagine trying to
[1:14:05] return back home and coming home and you
[1:14:08] know in in such a bad shape you know
[1:14:10] that your honor garment is suppose you
[1:14:13] know your beer is all chafing and and
[1:14:17] all of that what what a disgrace what a
[1:14:20] shame
[1:14:22] praise the Lord
[1:14:24] now this is what I want for us to follow
[1:14:27] this now these men were embarrassed but
[1:14:31] the reason why David will now bring them
[1:14:33] back home because the a shame is the
[1:14:37] shame of Israel amen the a shame is the
[1:14:43] shame of the kingdom praise the Lord
[1:14:49] and that's what we have to know that
[1:14:53] your shame is machine whatever
[1:15:00] embarrasses you embarrass the entire
[1:15:03] kingdom embarrasses the entire day
[1:15:07] embarrasses the Church of the Living God
[1:15:12] praise the Lord and so
[1:15:20] David went to me the man and told him
[1:15:24] well you stay right here in Jericho now
[1:15:28] you have to remember that Jericho was a
[1:15:33] city that was cursed by Joshua even
[1:15:39] though it was a curse setting but
[1:15:41] Jericho has a history of testimony
[1:15:47] praise the Lord
[1:15:49] amen it has a history of testimony where
[1:15:56] I am sharing the message that fate has
[1:15:59] saved a he said Jericho was always a
[1:16:02] curse city since the Jews possessed
[1:16:05] polished and he said Joshua said curse
[1:16:08] is the man that we built this city
[1:16:12] Jericho always represents backsliding
[1:16:17] Jerusalem sits above Jericho the
[1:16:21] heavenly and and as it left Jericho
[1:16:27] going down you are you are going away
[1:16:30] from God the curse said it the blessed
[1:16:34] one side and the curse City on the other
[1:16:36] side so he said Jericho always
[1:16:39] represented back slating amen
[1:16:43] Jericho was a cursed place but Jericho
[1:16:48] always hold a testimony that's a
[1:16:52] paradise given and what I want for us to
[1:16:54] just look at it together Wednesday night
[1:16:57] we were talking and using sin John
[1:16:59] chapter 4 brother Branham says here who
[1:17:02] is this the chassis deck he said that he
[1:17:09] says now one days in John chapter four
[1:17:13] he he had me to go bust a mirror on his
[1:17:20] road down to Jericho praise the Lord
[1:17:26] now there's a kind of a parallel years
[1:17:30] when you look at it
[1:17:33] now we were talking about how Jesus went
[1:17:35] down and met that woman and you know and
[1:17:37] took her from the house of shame to the
[1:17:39] house of testimony well actually he was
[1:17:41] on his road to Jericho
[1:17:44] praise the Lord amen
[1:17:48] and since John chapter fall he said I
[1:17:51] must need go by the way of Samara
[1:17:54] but his destination was over to Jericho
[1:17:59] now follow me in a little bit now on the
[1:18:03] road to Jericho went up around some
[1:18:07] merit and why he was going up there he
[1:18:10] sat down on the well outside of the city
[1:18:13] of Syria and the well if you have if you
[1:18:19] have ever been there it's a little
[1:18:24] panoramic about like this year and and
[1:18:28] and there is a public spring there the
[1:18:31] water were they all come and the women
[1:18:36] come all the morning get their pots of
[1:18:39] water and and and put it on the head and
[1:18:43] and and one on each hip and walk is just
[1:18:49] as strange as can be never spill a drop
[1:18:54] talk to one another the people come out
[1:18:57] there so this was about eleven hour of
[1:19:02] the day I got stuck on this last night a
[1:19:05] little bit because there are a couple of
[1:19:10] places you see where the prophet of God
[1:19:12] referred today's as this was about the
[1:19:15] eleventh hour and and there are other
[1:19:17] places you say was about known now what
[1:19:22] got me stuck on this because the
[1:19:24] scripture said it was about the sixth
[1:19:27] hour
[1:19:28] that's what the scripture said amen is
[1:19:33] that what the Bible says in st. John
[1:19:36] chapter 4 that it was about the sixth
[1:19:39] hour now what happened is there when
[1:19:43] when I started looking into this
[1:19:46] you know it's just it's just those
[1:19:48] things that you know I mean they grab
[1:19:51] your attention you you don't sleep until
[1:19:54] you can be able to figure out what was
[1:19:56] going on year praise the Lord but what
[1:19:59] is happening here is they're the the
[1:20:04] Jewish hours just like we talked about
[1:20:07] the watches of the night amen
[1:20:11] the first watch the second watch and the
[1:20:17] Terr watch of the night and that is the
[1:20:20] same with how the Jews called their time
[1:20:24] so the Jewish time from the rising of
[1:20:28] the Sun the first hour starts praise the
[1:20:34] Lord
[1:20:35] amen so from the rising of the Sun
[1:20:38] depending on when the Sun comes up maybe
[1:20:43] about 5:00 a.m. or five tearing that the
[1:20:47] Jewish hour of the day starts so we our
[1:20:54] timepiece is mostly under the Roman
[1:20:57] because we use the Roman calendar we use
[1:21:00] the Roman time is completely different
[1:21:03] from the Jewish time praise the Lord
[1:21:08] Amen so under the Roman time it will be
[1:21:15] the sixth hour it will be like almost no
[1:21:22] honor under the Jewish time is the sixth
[1:21:24] hour under the Roman time is about 11
[1:21:28] o'clock noon praise the Lord
[1:21:33] now another place that would that would
[1:21:37] that would kind of for grab your
[1:21:39] attention on this as chapter 2 verse 15
[1:21:42] the Bible says for this man are not
[1:21:45] drunk as he suppose seeing it is about
[1:21:51] the Terr hour of the day
[1:21:59] in seeing that this is above the tail
[1:22:03] hour of the day so this was just around
[1:22:06] 9 a.m. when the holy ghost came on the
[1:22:12] date of Pentecost and those people
[1:22:14] started speaking in tongues and and and
[1:22:16] and you know and running around and and
[1:22:19] all of that now if you go back again you
[1:22:22] will see that the Bible says about the
[1:22:25] death of Jesus Christ
[1:22:27] March chapter 27 the Bible says and now
[1:22:30] from the six hours there was darkness
[1:22:34] all over the land until the ninth hour
[1:22:40] so when Jesus was hanging on the cross
[1:22:43] from the sixth hour which was just about
[1:22:47] noon eleven twelve that was the reason
[1:22:52] why it became it became striking to the
[1:22:57] people because darkness came right in
[1:22:59] the middle of the day if it was six
[1:23:04] o'clock darkness it would not surprise
[1:23:06] him
[1:23:07] because by that time of the day attack
[1:23:11] but when they hang him on the cross
[1:23:13] about the sixth hour darkness came right
[1:23:19] in the middle of the day and the
[1:23:23] darkness and by it got stopped for about
[1:23:26] three hours so from from about eleven
[1:23:29] twelve o'clock until 3:00 p.m. it was
[1:23:32] completely dark where Branham says the
[1:23:38] Sun refused to see its maker on the
[1:23:40] cross it closes its eyes
[1:23:51] so what are we talking about it was
[1:23:53] about eleven o'clock a man oh my
[1:23:59] goodness
[1:23:59] praise the Lord Amen people that's why
[1:24:05] we that's why we love this message a
[1:24:09] many it makes the Bible the new book the
[1:24:15] Bible becomes an open book
[1:24:23] because all the women went to the well
[1:24:25] in the early part of the morning it was
[1:24:28] for all the the wives and you know the
[1:24:31] young women the virgins and all of that
[1:24:33] but when it gets to that afternoon time
[1:24:36] and the Sun is coming up everybody goes
[1:24:39] away they have all fetch their water
[1:24:40] that's when this woman sneaked out he
[1:24:43] men just about that time praise the Lord
[1:24:49] yeah that thing caught my mind so I
[1:24:51] wanted to share with you their selves I
[1:24:54] didn't want to dwell on the earth but I
[1:24:55] just wanted to bring their out him in
[1:24:57] and and in the parallel year to realize
[1:25:00] that here a David men were put to shame
[1:25:06] and he kept them in the city of Jericho
[1:25:09] Jesus here going to the city of Jericho
[1:25:12] and then he but he had to pass by the
[1:25:14] way of Samara I was just trying to keep
[1:25:17] those parallel together amen
[1:25:19] because Jericho is the house of
[1:25:23] testimony praise the Lord
[1:25:26] you know we remember we all remember
[1:25:31] Rahab and what happened the people went
[1:25:36] around the wall of Jericho just praising
[1:25:39] God the walls of Jericho came down he
[1:25:41] men the Good Samaritan it was on the
[1:25:45] road of Jericho praise the Lord
[1:25:47] blombo team was received his sight at
[1:25:50] the gate of Jericho Amen Jesus caused
[1:25:56] Zacchaeus down from the tree by the
[1:25:58] weight of Jericho even though it is a
[1:26:05] curse it it
[1:26:06] what is is a city of testimony praise
[1:26:11] the Lord
[1:26:12] amen amen
[1:26:16] are we together yes so we saw as we look
[1:26:21] at this together what I want for us to
[1:26:25] realize here is that you know like we
[1:26:30] read from the scripture it's ruining
[1:26:32] them that are sick that needs a
[1:26:34] physician amen
[1:26:35] and there is something that is unique
[1:26:37] about medical science but random talks
[1:26:39] about how they have that ambling about
[1:26:42] Iraq of the stepping around the poor
[1:26:44] remain and we ever give them that
[1:26:47] inspiration the God from what God told
[1:26:50] Moses to do praise the Lord amen and
[1:26:53] then there there is just something
[1:26:55] unique about them also you get down to
[1:26:58] the hospital I mean they charge you in
[1:27:00] the register you in and everything and
[1:27:03] to make sure that you are dears they
[1:27:06] tell you they bring you a menu wear your
[1:27:11] suit like this but for them to tell you
[1:27:14] that you now honor our care it will
[1:27:17] bring you again take all your suit your
[1:27:18] necktie wear your gown praise the Lord
[1:27:22] and they always having you put and it
[1:27:28] tying it to the back praise the Lord
[1:27:31] it's a sign that you are here for help
[1:27:38] that backside that relief open is a
[1:27:40] sound that you I hear to be helped
[1:27:47] praise the Lord Amen so I mean if you
[1:27:54] know if you if you are if you are too
[1:27:56] fancy you might have the best the most
[1:27:58] expensive nightgown home but they want
[1:28:00] you to keep that one on him and tell you
[1:28:04] that you are here for help
[1:28:06] praise the Lord now so out of this man
[1:28:12] had you know what the same
[1:28:15] identification year those men of honor
[1:28:18] you know tear their closet expose their
[1:28:21] nakedness and and give it hard to keep
[1:28:24] them down there you know until you can
[1:28:27] find a way you know for their for their
[1:28:29] beer to grow in and bring them a change
[1:28:31] of clothes and and in order there before
[1:28:36] they can come home to their wife and
[1:28:37] their family and to the house of Israel
[1:28:40] Lord
[1:28:41] so David had to keep them there he had
[1:28:43] to take them out of out of that place of
[1:28:45] shame and just keep them right there in
[1:28:48] Jericho
[1:28:49] because Jericho will hold them a
[1:28:52] testimony he's going to use that you go
[1:28:54] back and read the rest of the story
[1:28:56] there you'll find out what will happen
[1:28:58] now this is just to put us in a place to
[1:29:00] realize just like we're air from Genesis
[1:29:04] chapter 2 25 you know and the scripture
[1:29:08] says and they were not ashamed but then
[1:29:10] after the why the Bible's dared caught
[1:29:12] us in a place where Genesis chapter 3
[1:29:15] tells us now man disobeyed God and break
[1:29:19] God's Word and pretty soon this man that
[1:29:21] was not ashamed this man I was gold
[1:29:24] conscious it's now hiding himself praise
[1:29:29] the Lord
[1:29:30] amen there is just something about it we
[1:29:39] all become very conscious if there is
[1:29:43] something of our you know of our
[1:29:45] backside that is that is that is exposed
[1:29:50] a young man can be playing in sooner his
[1:29:54] pants rip in the back he stopped
[1:29:55] becoming embarrassed what if somebody is
[1:29:57] looking at you or net for the mother day
[1:29:59] for the matter of fact that that trouser
[1:30:01] is told behind you you just feel
[1:30:04] insecure praise the Lord
[1:30:09] what are somebody looking at you on now
[1:30:10] you just nobody know what has happened
[1:30:14] but something is telling you that I'm
[1:30:18] not secure
[1:30:21] praise the Lord
[1:30:23] have it happen to you before
[1:30:29] praise the Lord sometimes even give you
[1:30:33] the most strange walk and you put smile
[1:30:41] on your face because you want to capture
[1:30:43] everybody and nobody should look behind
[1:30:45] it
[1:30:50] praise the Lord
[1:30:51] and that's what happened when people are
[1:30:53] having strange walk it means that they
[1:30:55] are hiding something when it just
[1:30:59] stopped behaving strange in church
[1:31:02] strange around the home praise the Lord
[1:31:10] then shame has come in you see shame
[1:31:13] makes people to lose their identity they
[1:31:19] lose the irregular behavior they just
[1:31:22] that you know want to behave more nice I
[1:31:26] mean they are taking knives to another
[1:31:29] level
[1:31:31] just because they don't want to be
[1:31:33] caught praise the Lord but you know
[1:31:40] shame can only shame you if you don't
[1:31:44] deal with shame it can only shame you
[1:31:48] praise the Lord
[1:31:49] but you see the quicker you deal with
[1:31:51] shame is normally shame it become a
[1:31:55] testimony praise the Lord
[1:32:04] and I was looking at this in looking in
[1:32:08] the what blood Bentham shed over in a
[1:32:10] messy shame he says here now the word
[1:32:13] ashamed could be translated embarrassed
[1:32:18] you know something that you are faced
[1:32:25] with something that you are embarrassed
[1:32:27] about being ashamed that's another thing
[1:32:33] being ashamed does it shows that you are
[1:32:37] not sure of what you are talking about
[1:32:41] if you know what you are talking about
[1:32:44] and have the assurance that you know
[1:32:49] what you are talking about you can tell
[1:32:51] anybody that I mean you are not ashamed
[1:32:55] you can tell anybody that anywhere
[1:32:58] anytime because you know what you're
[1:33:01] talking about you know what God has
[1:33:04] brought you true I mean it didn't happen
[1:33:06] to another person it happened to you you
[1:33:09] can see it anytime anywhere
[1:33:12] praise the Lord but when your experience
[1:33:15] is not sure then the story is this way
[1:33:21] one time and the other time the house
[1:33:22] the cow is on top of the house eating
[1:33:25] grass praise the Lord
[1:33:32] you can tell anybody that you are not
[1:33:35] ashamed but if you feel put off out of
[1:33:38] place it shows you are not sure then you
[1:33:44] become embarrassed then you start
[1:33:48] stammering you start messing your words
[1:33:54] praise the Lord Amen and then I took I
[1:34:00] took I took brother branham definition
[1:34:03] because I was thinking about it and I
[1:34:05] went back and and and I starts to look
[1:34:07] at this of the way he did kind of or
[1:34:11] defined this word because I I just been
[1:34:14] kind of for dealing with that on my
[1:34:16] you know you know because sometimes
[1:34:27] there are a lot of things that being
[1:34:29] misrepresented Amen you find some people
[1:34:36] you know that that is just I mean I mean
[1:34:39] they kind of owe swallow up caught up in
[1:34:42] a spirit of pride and sometimes they
[1:34:46] think they have they have shame face
[1:34:51] that's not shame face amen you know
[1:34:57] having a humble blushing face it's
[1:35:00] something completely different from
[1:35:02] machine face a face that there is that
[1:35:08] is respectful and reverent to the Word
[1:35:10] of God it's completely different so I
[1:35:15] went back I started looking at this in
[1:35:17] and I I found these two two words that
[1:35:21] kind of a brought out the meaning better
[1:35:25] then I said okay I see what Weber
[1:35:27] Brennan took his definition from you
[1:35:29] know because the thing about it recently
[1:35:31] I was talking to a brother and and and I
[1:35:34] told the brother I said most of the time
[1:35:38] we try to we try to define scriptural
[1:35:42] words with modern dictionary amen
[1:35:47] but you will realize that scripture
[1:35:50] define itself praise the Lord
[1:36:00] scripture define itself
[1:36:07] so ashamed I mean in embarrass which of
[1:36:13] course was the word I was looking at
[1:36:14] means to be ashamed to be confounded you
[1:36:17] know to display shame dumbest regime
[1:36:24] cause embarrassment and I took another
[1:36:27] word I don't know which one of them is I
[1:36:29] think the first one I read it was from
[1:36:31] the Hebrew and this one is is from the
[1:36:34] Greek to be without resources you know
[1:36:42] for people to be talking things just
[1:36:45] because this is that's what my church
[1:36:47] believed or that's what my pastor says
[1:36:50] that's what our church says and I really
[1:36:54] never took a time to really out of God's
[1:36:58] Word you don't have a resource you are
[1:37:02] just only saying it because you yeah
[1:37:04] they said it praise the Lord to be in a
[1:37:14] strait it's a narrow path to be left
[1:37:21] wanting to be embarrassed to be in doubt
[1:37:27] not to know which way to turn
[1:37:32] Amen not to know which way to turn to be
[1:37:41] at a loose of oneself were you aware
[1:37:47] you're not having yourself under control
[1:37:50] it can be embarrassing to be in doubt
[1:38:02] not to know how to decide or what to do
[1:38:05] or to be perplex praise Lord we have to
[1:38:17] know that God has not given us the
[1:38:19] spirit of fear amen
[1:38:23] but his word has come to give us a sign
[1:38:33] and just like I said when God made man
[1:38:36] in the beginning he made man to be
[1:38:38] upright he made man up right toe stuck
[1:38:43] in the earth like roots praise the Lord
[1:38:58] so then we realize something happened
[1:39:00] that put man in this shameful condition
[1:39:05] and we all have things that are very
[1:39:10] shameful of our lives
[1:39:12] amen for my real father
[1:39:16] our first birth it's shameful verbatim
[1:39:21] says no matter where it was in the best
[1:39:23] Hospital he says every birth is a mess
[1:39:29] praise the Lord and God by His grace has
[1:39:33] come to take us out of the house of
[1:39:35] shame toward the house of testimony
[1:39:43] praise the Lord and to get out of the
[1:39:47] house of shame we have to be God
[1:39:50] conscious
[1:39:50] let me read something else here that
[1:39:52] girl from the message of shame he says
[1:39:55] and you notice Amen you notice there is
[1:40:00] so much of that today especially on the
[1:40:03] subject that I'm now speaking of a shame
[1:40:06] of the word praise the Lord now he and
[1:40:14] his word is the same in the beginning
[1:40:16] was the word the Word was with God the
[1:40:19] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:40:21] dwelt among us the same yesterday today
[1:40:25] and forever and whatsoever is ashamed of
[1:40:28] me and my word praise the Lord you know
[1:40:34] over and over Jesus said that through
[1:40:36] the gospel whosoever is a shame of me in
[1:40:39] this word I would be a shame of him now
[1:40:43] most of most of the time the the the the
[1:40:46] the secular believer they were only
[1:40:48] thing there when Jesus says that is to
[1:40:51] be ashamed of the name of Jesus it's not
[1:40:55] the name of Jesus he said was whoever is
[1:40:57] ashamed of me and what is Jesus Christ
[1:41:01] in every age is his word is the promised
[1:41:05] word to that age
[1:41:10] and that is the reason why through the
[1:41:14] seven church ages every time he comes to
[1:41:17] the church edge if you go back and read
[1:41:20] from revelation chapter three every time
[1:41:23] he comes to the church age he identify
[1:41:26] himself I am the Alpha and Omega I am
[1:41:30] the beginning and the end why because in
[1:41:33] every age God has an identification and
[1:41:37] you have to identify him in your age if
[1:41:42] you don't identify him you will be
[1:41:45] struck with a historic guard you obese
[1:41:49] you just be stuck because you realize to
[1:41:52] the Gentile Church he identified himself
[1:41:55] to every church age and it's not the
[1:41:58] same identification one is not the same
[1:42:01] identification it's the same God with
[1:42:04] the same characteristics but God in
[1:42:07] every age will will will hide himself
[1:42:09] behind a man behind a ministry praise
[1:42:16] the Lord
[1:42:17] it's the same Jesus speaking to Ephesian
[1:42:22] Church age it's the same Jesus speaking
[1:42:24] to the simnet church age but when he
[1:42:27] speaks and identified himself to the age
[1:42:29] he does not use the same identification
[1:42:35] praise the Lord and that is the reason
[1:42:38] why people are ashamed of him praise the
[1:42:44] Lord I just I just read an article of a
[1:42:50] church that was going to have a new
[1:42:52] pastor and what he did was he first time
[1:42:56] to the church he dressed like a homeless
[1:42:59] man he disguised himself like a homeless
[1:43:05] man and then he came to the church the
[1:43:09] very people are wanting this new pastor
[1:43:12] he came as a homeless man and I mean he
[1:43:15] was sitting right there to the church
[1:43:17] and and I mean and he I mean he could
[1:43:20] see the the more
[1:43:23] unbelieving attitude from from from from
[1:43:26] the people that he was coming to Pastor
[1:43:31] praise the Lord
[1:43:35] amen
[1:43:37] well I guess if if if if some of them
[1:43:47] knew that that there was the a pastor
[1:43:50] you know even if they have a funny
[1:43:54] attitude to homeless people they will
[1:43:57] smile at him that they praise the Lord
[1:44:03] but because they they never knew that he
[1:44:07] was the one there was this guy see
[1:44:09] himself as a homeless man praise the
[1:44:18] Lord and you could see how the people
[1:44:21] were caught in a shame when he realized
[1:44:26] that that was the a pastor that just
[1:44:30] disguise himself
[1:44:33] praise Lord oh that's that's an
[1:44:38] embarrassing situation I mean so just
[1:44:48] like just like I was saying and I said I
[1:44:51] was going to talk on this but I'm not
[1:44:55] speaking on their name by just giving an
[1:44:57] idea just so you can be able to see
[1:44:59] where I'm going with this revelation
[1:45:02] chapter 2 verse 1 on today on to the
[1:45:05] Church of Ephesus write these things
[1:45:09] said he the hold at the seven star now
[1:45:12] on to Ephesus church age this was Jesus
[1:45:16] identification he'd hold at the seven
[1:45:19] stars in his right hand who walketh in
[1:45:23] the midst of the seven golden
[1:45:25] candlesticks
[1:45:27] praise the Lord now if you look at this
[1:45:30] now this is to the Gentile age the first
[1:45:35] Gentile church he
[1:45:36] taking on this identification this is
[1:45:39] he's he identifying him says he I'm the
[1:45:42] one writing on to your episode the one
[1:45:45] that hold at the seven stars in his
[1:45:47] right hand the one that walketh in the
[1:45:50] mists and if you if I sort of God as a
[1:45:57] daughter of God if reading our Bible the
[1:46:01] one that walketh in the midst where does
[1:46:03] it takes our mind to back to Genesis the
[1:46:06] one that was walking in the midst of the
[1:46:08] garden has not come again to walk in the
[1:46:11] midst of the seventh church so it's just
[1:46:17] God masking himself the same one that
[1:46:22] was working in the cool of the evening
[1:46:24] and how was he walking in Genesis how
[1:46:30] did the Bible says how was he walking
[1:46:31] the voice of God was walking in the
[1:46:35] mists of the garden now there's a voice
[1:46:40] of God here the same one praise the Lord
[1:46:48] now you see if you can identify if you
[1:46:52] can identify a person you will never be
[1:46:55] a team of him what are the change their
[1:46:57] form I believe they are taught that
[1:47:00] their their pastor his wife knew he was
[1:47:03] the one do you think that she would be
[1:47:05] ashame of her husband she knows that he
[1:47:07] was the one this guy see himself he was
[1:47:13] the one in there so she would not be
[1:47:16] ashame of him praise and that is the
[1:47:24] thing that is crossing shame that's the
[1:47:28] thing that caused Adam shame he was not
[1:47:31] ashamed of our sins but for them when
[1:47:33] naked in the garden there was not
[1:47:35] ashamed but what caused shame well
[1:47:39] pretty soon oh wow amen
[1:47:48] he has lost their consciousness of God
[1:47:51] he has lost the whole evil it's now his
[1:47:58] conscious of himself he realized that
[1:48:03] he's naked himself in shame the same one
[1:48:12] that identified himself to the FSO
[1:48:15] church as the one hole in the seventh
[1:48:17] side the one who walketh in the midst of
[1:48:19] the seven golden candlesticks when it
[1:48:21] came down to the second church age verse
[1:48:27] 8 how did he identify him said the same
[1:48:30] one and onto the angel of the church of
[1:48:35] Sam the right this thing said the first
[1:48:40] and the last which was dead and is alive
[1:48:47] amen that's how he identified himself to
[1:48:51] that age so the believer of the age
[1:48:58] receiving that letter
[1:49:00] norine who is he that was dead and is
[1:49:03] alive amen
[1:49:06] who is he he said I can lay down my life
[1:49:13] and I will raise it up again you see so
[1:49:17] that is the reason why the media birth
[1:49:19] the believer of the age seeing this
[1:49:22] identification they will see the man but
[1:49:27] he knows that the ministry is Jesus
[1:49:29] Christ amen
[1:49:37] that's how he identifying himself to
[1:49:40] that age
[1:49:45] we together for the Bahamas Church age
[1:49:50] and onto the Pergamos Church is ver 12
[1:49:55] these things say he which have the shop
[1:50:01] saw with two-edged Hebrews chapter 12
[1:50:05] Hebrew 4:12
[1:50:07] is that one another why the scripture
[1:50:10] the Word of God is sharper and two edges
[1:50:13] war so here he identified himself as the
[1:50:19] word and our word that is like a two
[1:50:26] inch of soil it can discern it can
[1:50:29] pierce even to the X nor endure between
[1:50:34] the spirit and a soul it can discern the
[1:50:38] heart so he's identifying himself all of
[1:50:42] this identification is just one man the
[1:50:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:49] that's the Lord Jesus Christ but he's
[1:50:53] using different masks as he come to this
[1:50:55] church age he he he he picks on and
[1:50:59] ministry picks on a man that is the
[1:51:05] reason why you would not have problem
[1:51:07] with the messenger if you know the
[1:51:10] identification and whew is he that have
[1:51:13] identified himself praise the Lord Amen
[1:51:22] it's just like our church's Good
[1:51:26] Shepherd who is the Good Shepherd the
[1:51:28] Lord Jesus not me
[1:51:31] Amen is the Lord Jesus he is the Good
[1:51:35] Shepherd but as a church we can trust
[1:51:40] that he will be able to give us a man
[1:51:43] that will be burdened with the people
[1:51:45] burning with the Word of God that will
[1:51:47] reflect the Good Shepherd so he
[1:51:51] identified himself in every age
[1:51:59] HIDA had a shop 2x war amen to the
[1:52:07] terror tear at church age verse 18 this
[1:52:14] thing said the Son of God amen
[1:52:21] who have his eyes like a flame of fire
[1:52:26] and his feet like farm rise praise the
[1:52:36] Lord this thing said the Son of God and
[1:52:47] if we realize Jesus came in three sons
[1:52:51] name Amen
[1:52:54] a son of man which is always referred to
[1:52:58] a prophet praise the Lord the Son of God
[1:53:03] that was the Amana promise of God among
[1:53:09] his people the anointing of the Holy
[1:53:11] Ghost praise the Lord and the son of
[1:53:17] David wishes a millennial promise are we
[1:53:23] together and year to the territorial
[1:53:27] church age he's identifying himself as
[1:53:31] the son of God oh I wish I was talking
[1:53:37] on the identification of Jesus Christ in
[1:53:40] all ages praise the Lord my mind is
[1:53:45] going to something this morning but
[1:53:46] we're almost out of time
[1:53:48] I'm just only trying to point point us
[1:53:52] to the place that when you can identify
[1:53:54] the person you cannot be ashame of him
[1:54:02] praise the Lord
[1:54:03] you cannot be a shame of him because you
[1:54:09] know who he who he is
[1:54:11] praise the Lord and you see them and and
[1:54:16] that's what God is doing in in in in the
[1:54:20] life of his children because it's Christ
[1:54:23] in you the hope of glory inside his
[1:54:35] church age you can just go back and just
[1:54:37] and just you know and just look look
[1:54:41] over all of these things onto the
[1:54:43] injured of the saddest church existing

[1:55:12] a seven style you know hold of the seven
[1:55:14] style in a year in the inside his church
[1:55:17] age

[1:55:21] style is Christ he feels everything amen
[1:55:28] the seven spirit year is not seven
[1:55:32] individual spirit that will make us
[1:55:34] worse than Trinity it's one God just
[1:55:38] breaking himself out just like God took
[1:55:41] that the spirit of Moses and put it on
[1:55:44] all of those men just for the same work
[1:55:49] amen just like on a date of Pentecost if
[1:55:56] he pour out his spirit on his church

[2:04:15] us out of the house of shame amen
[2:04:23] stickiness out of the house of shame and
[2:04:26] this body is the house of shame because

[2:04:49] our spirit set up in up in a position
[2:04:53] word you know we just feel condemned the
[2:05:02] more we get closer to God that's the
[2:05:04] more our spirit ought to be lifted we
[2:05:10] must be enjoying this grace that has
[2:05:12] come to us
[2:05:27] well we want to thank the Lord Jesus
[2:05:31] amen
[2:05:32] praise the Lord Paul says if this
[2:05:37] tabernacle be dissolved there's another
[2:05:40] one that is waiting for us praise the
[2:05:46] Lord and that Tabernacle is the
[2:05:49] tabernacle of testimony praise the Lord
[2:05:54] people are getting the shame of the
[2:05:56] message getting the shame of the
[2:05:59] messenger you don't know what God has
[2:06:02] given to you
[2:06:03] praise the Lord you don't know what God
[2:06:07] has given to you you don't know what
[2:06:10] grace you have walked right into where
[2:06:14] branches is just like that man condemned
[2:06:17] to death and he was going to be Hank and
[2:06:20] and his friend went and plea you know to
[2:06:23] the governor and the governor came right
[2:06:26] into his room all this identification
[2:06:30] that I'm reading in this in this in the
[2:06:32] scripture in a way that God was
[2:06:34] identified to all of these ages there
[2:06:36] were not men when Luther rose up in his
[2:06:40] age people who see Luther as a Catholic
[2:06:46] priest that was breaking out of
[2:06:47] capitalism but it was God that was
[2:06:49] hidden behind a man to bring a
[2:06:54] Reformation this exact identification
[2:06:58] that we read in this scripture it was
[2:07:01] that scripture taken on flesh when he
[2:07:07] stepped out of the Lutheran Church it
[2:07:09] was that particular scripture that was
[2:07:11] made flesh because he was the messenger
[2:07:17] of their age
[2:07:24] and because the governor was not you
[2:07:27] know he was not having a flashy card
[2:07:31] order you know and anything flashy de
[2:07:35] that ball just he I mean he abuses
[2:07:38] pattern praise the Lord
[2:07:51] when the governor was right there to
[2:07:54] write out his pattern for him to go free
[2:07:56] and that's what will happen if you if we
[2:08:00] don't make use of the grease that has
[2:08:02] come to us the grace that has come come
[2:08:06] to us coming meet us in our state praise
[2:08:12] the Lord
[2:08:13] to rewrite our history to break our our
[2:08:18] alive from from from from curses help
[2:08:21] our children if we don't if we don't
[2:08:26] embrace this and justing that is another
[2:08:29] denomination is another church and and
[2:08:31] and and i mean it's the grace of god we
[2:08:38] should never be a shame of what god has
[2:08:40] given to us people are ashamed what they
[2:08:50] erase the ayah shame of the sx the a
[2:08:52] shame of everything the a shame of the
[2:08:54] appearance
[2:09:11] praise the Lord His grace is to take us
[2:09:15] from the house of shame to a house of
[2:09:18] testimony amen just like how God made
[2:09:23] the woman at the world her life at
[2:09:25] testimony and the Bible says she she
[2:09:27] brought many to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09:31] because she broke out of her house of
[2:09:34] Sheen the very house that one day was
[2:09:37] unashamed was now a house of testimony
[2:09:40] and I brought many to the Lord Jesus and
[2:09:42] God can do the same to you if we are
[2:09:47] involving ourselves in things that is
[2:09:48] making it a shame we better break out of
[2:09:50] that because it would just robbed you it
[2:09:57] would just rob you praise the Lord I
[2:10:00] mean it will rob you I mean it will it
[2:10:04] will make you just like that little boy
[2:10:07] nobody no he just he just jumped you
[2:10:11] know I mean he jumped up from down he
[2:10:14] ripped his his his paints nobody know
[2:10:17] that but I mean he's just eating by his
[2:10:20] shame until he's looking over his
[2:10:22] shoulder putting a fix on his face
[2:10:26] nobody knows what is happening but he's
[2:10:32] caught up into a mind of Sheen as soon
[2:10:38] as people turn their eyes see me look at
[2:10:41] their faces I mean the president never
[2:10:43] even seen what you are doing
[2:10:45] it's your own shame that is
[2:10:57] praise the Lord but there is a man yet I
[2:11:00] can turn on the light amen
[2:11:04] there's a man year that can break the
[2:11:06] curse
[2:11:07] there's a man year that can walk us out
[2:11:10] of the out of out of the house of shame
[2:11:13] praise the Lord
[2:11:16] when he identify himself to our age when
[2:11:22] he identified himself to allow this your
[2:11:24] church age he identified himself as they
[2:11:28] amen the one that has the final say he
[2:11:35] identified himself that you know no
[2:11:38] medical doctor or medical science can
[2:11:40] define your health situation he has the
[2:11:43] finest aim the society cannot define you
[2:11:48] know your life situation he has the
[2:11:52] final say on to the Church of loud they
[2:11:54] should speak Amen the Amen the faithful
[2:12:01] and true witness praise the Lord the God
[2:12:08] that we ever remain faithful has come in
[2:12:11] your age to prove faithfulness to you
[2:12:15] and he also identified himself the
[2:12:20] beginning of the creation of God now you
[2:12:24] see that's the reason why their prophet
[2:12:26] messenger could break back before time
[2:12:30] because the gift the identification of
[2:12:34] Jesus that was in this age was nothing
[2:12:36] less than the logos because the logos is
[2:12:40] the beginning of the creation of God
[2:12:42] when God was moving from internal spirit
[2:12:45] the great intent of God he found himself
[2:12:50] into the logos it was the logos that
[2:12:56] John testified for in the beginning was
[2:12:59] the word the Word was with God and the
[2:13:00] Word was God
[2:13:01] it was the logos by him all things were
[2:13:04] created that's why the creating power
[2:13:06] could come back
[2:13:07] in our age because it's the
[2:13:09] identification of Jesus Christ in this
[2:13:11] age the beginning of the creation of God
[2:13:16] and you know what can also happen praise
[2:13:24] the Lord that creating power is here
[2:13:32] amen
[2:13:35] all things pass away behold all things I
[2:13:40] knew that creating power is here it's
[2:13:45] not in a shadow form like it was through
[2:13:48] or other ages musicians you can come
[2:13:57] praise the Lord
[2:14:13] people let's get to know the one that
[2:14:15] has come in our age let's get to know
[2:14:20] the one that is identified in our age
[2:14:26] praise the Lord
[2:14:28] if Jesus should take the clothes of a
[2:14:31] beggar will you be able to identify him
[2:14:36] well you can you be like see Martin I
[2:14:42] told his tall his coat and put it on
[2:14:46] that beggar in a night he had a dream he
[2:14:51] saw Jesus wearing a very same piece of
[2:14:53] coat that he pulled on the beggar
[2:14:56] [Music]
[2:15:04] praise the Lord
[2:15:06] [Music]
[2:15:09] sometimes we want them to you know come
[2:15:13] our church sometimes we want them to
[2:15:17] speak the same language we speak
[2:15:25] we have to realize that God changed his
[2:15:28] max through all the ages but his
[2:15:31] characteristics is the same and he's
[2:15:34] identified by his characteristics now by
[2:15:38] the changing of his max but by his
[2:15:41] characteristics
[2:15:43] [Music]
[2:15:51] there is nothing to be ashamed of we
[2:15:55] have a fountain that is filled with
[2:15:58] blood from amanwe vein we have a
[2:16:02] fountain in the house of David
[2:16:05] now we can go talk
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:13] we don't have to be just like nominal
[2:16:17] Christian the Bible says if we confess
[2:16:18] our sin he is faithful and just to
[2:16:21] forgive us and we just think that a well
[2:16:24] you know Lord Jesus you know you know
[2:16:27] I've done this thing again I mean you
