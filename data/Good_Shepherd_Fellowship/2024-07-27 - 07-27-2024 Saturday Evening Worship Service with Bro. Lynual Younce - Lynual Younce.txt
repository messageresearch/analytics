pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat I just I would like to just say a few things uh from uh the scripture that we read tonight uh we will first want to greet uh many of our friends that are streaming in tonight uh from uh uh different places Brothers uh were wanted to be linking to the service tonight from South Africa Nigeria and uh different places even those that couldn't make it in tonight and are streaming the service from home or from work we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus amen praise the lord we uh uh thought that it would have been a blessing for us to to put this time aside and and and just come and and Worship the Lord together this is uh uh I was just speaking with one of the brothers from South Africa this afternoon and uh he was reminding me this is about 20 years since I've been exposed to our dear brother music I remember I was back in South Africa in I was in in4 and uh I was traveling with a brother from Johannesburg to the Namibia border that's about 6 to 8 hours drive and uh and he was playing uh uh a music that I could connect with I was just uh hearing uh the voice of the prophet and you know hearing some words and that so I asked him who wrote this music you know and since that time uh uh I've been uh listening to brother Young's music and uh uh to many of us is it's not new we are familiar with faith but tonight we just wanted to come and worship together praise the Lord now uh uh this scripture we read tonight uh we are all familiar with it brother Brandon read the scripture preaching the message this day this scripture is fulfilled and uh uh the reason why I read it tonight because uh I was thinking about U where the prophet Isaiah mentioned that he's going to give us a Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness and we realized that uh uh when brother Brandon uh preached this message he show in the scripture how Jesus read this at the beginning of his ministry and he closed the book in the middle of uh verse two when he read to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord he closed the book and he hand it back to the priest and what the prophet was trying to show us is there there was another portion of the of this scripture that needed to be fulfilled there was an alpha part that was fulfilled there was a part for the bridegroom that was fulfilled and there is a part for the bride that needed to be fulfilled so Jesus never read the second portion of that scripture which is the day of Virgin which of course we know that we are all living in the day of Vengeance but uh so when brother Bram preached the message birth pain and after the experience we all know the story about it how God set the stage for that message to be preached and he reminded us there was a second part of the the verse to be fulfilled or the second part of that scripture and under the day of virgins which is the day of judgment God has promised his bride a special gift while the word is going on the [Music] Judgment verse three of that particular prophecy which of course verse three is the continuation of verse two verse two says to appoint unto them that moon in Zion and Zion we've been taught is a type of the Bride so we that are in Zion Zion is a chosen City that's how she's a top of the Bride he promised to give unto us Beauty for es praise the Lord he also promised to give unto us the O of joy for mour he promised to give unto us a Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness and in the message uh uh letting off the pressure brother brandham said the lead is taken out of hell demon Spirits are all stram into the Earth that's what is causing pressure but yet God is promising to give us a Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness praise the Lord that's what the message of the hour brought to us amen this message has come to give us Beauty for arches it have come to give us h h a oil of joy for M and A Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness praise the Lord so that's just what I want us to do tonight I want us to wear the Garment of Praise amen let's wear the Garment of Praise amen if you if you if you know the song uh the the technician will try to put the words up uh you sing the chorus alone where the Garment of Praise this is this is not for entertainment no this is for worship Lord amen this is for worship this is wor the message of the hour and we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled why because he has given us Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness praise the Lord so let's stand on our feet tonight let's stand on our feet tonight and uh uh I know you are all on the expectation you are saying brother one hurry up let's listen to the music that's fine tonight praise the Lord amen let's just sing the aorus uh uh the then we will turn the service over I just I just want you to to feel free tonight you know uh uh uh put on your Garment of Praise put on your shouting shoes amen and you know uh the one that you can tap your head and and if you're having the dancing shoes that that's okay also tonight we are together again let's just sing that chorus and uh uh why while we prepared ourself we will sing one more chorus and then

and another friend of mine I said my name is lenel y and I guess you know yours so that was the end of that I'm a I'm a little bit crazy but it keeps me from going insane oh I like to have fun and and work for God you know the entertainment world out there we lost a a wonderful family in a plane crash the nean singers were killed on their way to um they were going on a alasan cruise and people have paid to see all these gospel groups and I just breaks my heart you know message people are kind of cruel you're not one of us you know you're not one of them but God has people in all uh All Phases of life he has people that don't know anything about this message but knows Jesus and message people are so guilty of talking to people and the first thing they say is have you heard of God's Prophet William brandom now what you should say have you heard of My Savior Jesus Christ Let Jesus Christ do the rest of it so uh the uh sincerity of our hearts is being recorded right now from heaven and God it's just it's a Ministry singing The Prophet said is a Ministry and uh when I was uh 23 year old I was offered a country contract and I was offered a job going in the tent Ministry $50 a week so here was a country contract and traveling and playing a guitar singing sit in the tent guess what I did I turned down the country contract for $50 a week and the devil strowed it in my face all my life I'll get broke sometime and have a rough time said see you wouldn't be like this if You' had done but you know what I wouldn't trade what I feel right now for nothing else there that they have to offer and to know that when he spoke to me I asked him what he wanted me to do he said I want you to sing the brightest song I had just come into the message and I was what a powerful thing to say sing my brighter song and here you are and here I am Thousand Years Later seems like and still singing the brightest song got so much to sing so much to tell but one of the songs that U I think in South Africa right now they bring their Minister out with this song you know where we are in the KE G you people I've got a little bit of a cough but I'll cough every other word and sing every it don't make no difference to me but just relaxing if you can sing help me sing if you can't sing don't H me sing we're going to have a lot of fun though we're going to have a we're going to have a wonderful time could I already feel them I already feel the man here God Gave Me a Song very early in the in my writing so there's a story in the Bible of Elisha she a m woman and her son the woman found favor with God and he gave her [Music] son while working in the field the little boy had died but a woman's face never failed even in death she testified the all is well yes all is well all is well we have heard the message Shone and all is [Music] well there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner ve so rest little bride rest for always well now things have not worked out like God's people thought for we're still here fighting the greatest battle ever fought Oh we must have the faith of Abraham knowing God's word never fails hope we'll trust in him we're going to find that all is well my wife said she can't hear me oh yeahall not long ago I wrote a verse another verse this song is right if I Sing It Go the same way oh the years are slowly gone by since we thought we'd be gone so many became discouraged and walked away oh over that bride of Christ keeps going on there's so much in this message still to be revealed so much as fful Ministry has to tell oh what is trust in him will'll keep singing always well help me sing yes all is well all is well we have heard the message Shalom and all his way there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner Veil so rest little bride

hospital room nobody but a patient there and I sing a person was I I think they thought they was getting ready to cross over but more did the Holy Ghost come down in that hospital room just me and that patient I they was shouting and praising God Amen it don't take a crowd it don't take to be impressive some way it takes the Lord Jesus and the Holy Ghost to move among the people hallah and uh and I've seen him I've sng in nursing [Music] homes this a I remember a lady had a she had a a baby doll and she thought it was a real baby and I remember singing singing to her several people in that room and watched her stop what she was doing she looked and she looked at me and tears pouring down her eyes God for a moment brought her back and let her enter into the spirit of God and we sit here

just recently over next close to Chicago about an hour out of Chicago and the people were singing they were really talented people they were singing and the people didn't respond with Applause I thought you know how strange this is and I got to get up here and sing in a minute and uh I said well I got up and sung and guess what that gave me that biggest hand you ever seen I thought in your face you devil usually and the whole time I was there they it's the same way they wouldn't give nobody else a hand but they clap from me so uh I worked hard so I deserve a hand when I get done singing a song [Applause] uh you know I'm from uh that's where I met this guy who he was come up and preach for my brother and uh Hills of Tennessee it's about uh 20 minutes in North Carolina about 20 minutes to Virginia right in a very corner of Tennessee so it makes me a Bonafide 14 karat gold hillbilly all right a so uh I don't try to be something I'm not I was my toys when I was playing I'd cut a stick off and it'd be about this long and have a little thing on the edge of it that I would I kind of move it like that I put 100,000 miles on that thing and I thought it was a motorcycle you know or get a a bicycle get a rim we used get a rim and take a coat hanger and bend it where it fit in that tire and run it all over creation so I was a a hill buil I was I was born kind of stupid got worse as I got older so but one thing that that I do and our family was there's 10 kids in my family so 10 there was a seven boys and three girls I thought there was five ahead of me and I was up to the fifth so I always say five were wise and five were foolish no but um we would sing we go back we had an altar back in those mountains and I remember I I received the Holy Ghost when I was 12 year old and uh my mom played the piano in church my dad was a song leader and uh we would pray in that Altar and the whole family and shouting out of them woods and praising God you could hear us all over the hills and today they' loock you up if you tried that but he brought me to this place that I could meet you and I could uh look at you and and see your beautiful face and your smile and say you're a very fortunate people I look at you and I say wellow the Bride of Jesus Christ chosen before the foundation of the world wrote my name down in the Lamb's Book of Life he didn't judge me where I was contrary or I was ugly or how how I sounded singing he just wrote my name down and there's a and one day he'll call my name and I'll step into eternity am oh I feel him I praise His holy name right now I thank you for everything [Music] Lord I've seen a person get up and walk was in a wheelchair and a singing I was singing a song that that he it was so real to him there'll be another spring and when I got to the second course he was sit in that wheelchair and I said there will be another spring he got up at that wheelchair and walked across that that place and praise God so here tonight if you're if you're sick if you have a problem if you're lonely if you're if you're desperate for something just relax because the doctor's here amen the doctor is here and I I call him the great physician a man what a physician he is he looks right down in my heart looks into my life and snap his fingers and all is well he makes everything perfect [Music] I started seeing some age and creeping into my eyes if you you've heard this store if You' seen any of my videos and I hair started turning a little gray right here it's a whole whole nine yards is a gray right now just all turned but I got to keep it that's the main thing it can turn any way you want to but I I got to keep it but I at the age when my hair was starting to turn and I was standing out on the front porch of my house and there's some huge oak trees in a yard and uh the wind was blowing it was cool late September and I looked across the street and the flower had bowed its head to the wind and I thought you know if few days is just going to be ugly these leaves are all turning I saw red and gold on top of one of those trees I thought you know that it'll all die just as plain as I'm talking to you right now God said yes but there will be another spring amen hallelujah so I put the words together in the D in the spring of my [Music] life everything was blooming pure and wise I run and play through fields of green listen to the robin [Music] sing then came the summer of my [Music] life lazy days staring nights thought those days would never end I felt that cool September wind now I reached Autumn not are getting [Music] cold trees are turning red and gold it's hard for me to realize that I'm getting old seem Like Only Yesterday my hair wasn't great but I'm not going to worry about these

man but uh but I see I like to see what God sees and he don't look at me my gray hair and my fading Humanity I'll step from his body one day whether it be in a Rapture or whether I just leave what difference does it make in a moment it's who was that said now you see me now you don't I'll uh when it be something to if the Rapture if you were be a part of that Rapture God it's the most awesome thing to think about just it can't be explained how it's going to happen I don't care how it's going to happen and I don't I don't care at all how it's going to happen I just want to be in the middle of what's going on I want to be that uh I want to be that person that I've worked for all my life like I told you I started singing when I was five I hadn't been a good boy all my life and I've had to like everybody else have problems and but always always make it right I always come back I'm like that preacher said there ain't no way he said there will be a way or I'll make one got to have the attitude that there there is a way Devil's not going to stop me amen he might Slow Me Down yes he slowed me down a lot the old age did that to me it wasn't Satan that was just time but I'm he slowed me down with with my health and I'm not a I've got stance in my heart and Jesus is in there [Music] somewhere I don't know what those St say what in the world is going on in here but uh he's a I'm not going to bore you to death tonight I'm I think I've got about 25 more songs and I'm going to close we didn't go over the storm song did we that's an e the storm song is a well it's a I've been through some pretty good pretty good battles so not many years ago I was I was a I was a building contractor Plus the gospel singer tried to be and I was up on a scaffold 17 ft to the ground they measured it and there's a pile of cinder blocks under me and that scaffold broke and I fell 17 ft and landed I broke a three crack vertebrae I was black and blue from head to toe I had 14 stitches in my head 10 in my elbow I broke everything on this side every rib uh lung collapse and uh doctor said I'm going to ask you a question but there's no way you should answer me I said why he said you should be dead I said I'm not dead and I'm not dying but I got work I got work to do you can't go to work dead you know amen so that was a that was a terrible time in my life and my wife is here with me and she's the most precious thing that God ever let me meet her name is Lis she's sitting right back [Applause] there she went through all this with me and you realize what that woman has done to keep our family together I got four kids I got a son who's a preacher I got three daughters you'd think that Lois and my three daughters or sisters they run around together all the time they but they're so precious and I got 18 [Music] grandchildren yeah and I got 12 great grandchildren and the oldest one's six you can imagine the oldest one is six-year old and every one of them owns a piece of me they just divided up I'm and they own me and I miss them so much when I'm gone and uh my my oldest great grand was baptized probably suay for last brother darl Ward baptized her and uh it was so precious and so I've been there and done that and whatever you here for tonight you didn't come to see an Entertainer that could have been an Entertainer probably I at least I was offered it I didn't come to entertain you I come to bring Jesus on the scene that's a and uh just just don't get up and sing I mean I could sing but I don't want to be just able to sing I want be back up voice by Jesus back up by the Holy Ghost I let him project the words as I speak to you and let him I've seen I've seen some of you as the words moved into your heart and your life I've seen it and that's my greatest reward money couldn't couldn't reward me with what I feel when what I work for on my life and to see it see it you just like a the preacher he preached and he sees all the studying that he done and he's seen the response of the price he paid to make to get to get that so my songs are are not just some entertainment somewhere it's a it's a Ministry and brother Bram says singing is a Ministry and everybody that sings is not a minister of singing they're singers but I want to be I'm going to sing one more song and I'm going to rest for a perir minutes is that okay you got somebody can sing you see I to

I think I love you so um there's nothing special as a a sweetheart she's not just my wife she's my sweetheart and uh I know I don't I worship a ground she walks on she's a she's everything that I've ever said a you want me to shut up Lord but she knows I love her I've spent many week and months away from her I look back on our marriage and think at the times of somewhere in Africa or I've been in 4 five foreign countries and uh God has allowed me to meet some most special people on the planet the Bride of Jesus Christ no matter what color she is how tall she is how short she is how rich or how poor she is she's his and that makes her special that makes her the queen thank you that makes her absolutely the queenall she's a she is so wonderful and uh and to sit it like this and and to look into your eyes and and know that he'd call me to talk to you and sing to you and uh I count that one of the most a privilege that I couldn't have found out where I was I would have I know I would have went down that road and at that time I would have it's hard telling what would have happened but today I'd be an old drunk singing Your Cheating Heart but something in me would still be crying out I couldn't get away from it I don't care what I done I'd never Escape what this is right now this is so precious to sit in this atmosphere you can't see him but if he would open your spiritual eyes
