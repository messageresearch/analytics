[41:10] in the way that without complication
[41:13] amen the way the the word comes to to
[41:17] set us free the men to liberate us to
[41:21] make us to experience the part on Luke
[41:23] chapter 18 let's just read about this
[41:25] woman and he speak our lord Jesus a
[41:29] parable unto them to this end
[41:32] Jesus speaking the parable unto them to
[41:35] this end that man
[41:37] ought always to pray
[41:39] and now to faint
[41:41] praise the Lord
[41:43] no wonder why the devil fight our prayer
[41:45] life
[41:46] amen
[41:48] because that's one thing we can do and
[41:50] we will never be out of the word of God
[41:52] when we are praying no matter where we
[41:55] are no matter what time of the day no
[41:58] matter how you are praying with your
[41:59] eyes open your eyes closed
[42:02] and no matter how you I pray you can
[42:05] never be out of the word of God
[42:07] praise the Lord and that's why the devil
[42:09] will do everything to fight our prayer
[42:12] life that man ought to always
[42:16] but always to pray and not to faint
[42:19] saying there was in a city a judge
[42:24] which fear in that God need a regarded
[42:27] man
[42:29] and there was a widow in that City
[42:34] and she came unto him saying avenge me
[42:39] of mine adversaries amen
[42:42] praise the Lord
[42:44] and he who net for a while
[42:48] but afterward
[42:50] he said within himself
[42:53] praise the Lord
[42:56] though I fear not God
[42:59] none
[43:00] regards man
[43:03] yet because this Widow trouble at me
[43:07] I will avenge her at least
[43:11] by her continuous coming she worries me
[43:16] now Jesus is using this story about an
[43:20] unjust judge a man that don't fear God
[43:24] and he don't regard anybody
[43:26] praise the Lord but yet he will he does
[43:30] not uh being able to build the courage
[43:33] to drive this woman away
[43:36] praise the Lord because of I believe
[43:39] that he might have lied to her
[43:42] so I'll do it next week and
[43:45] and yeah I'll take care of it tomorrow
[43:47] and the next day she's there again
[43:50] praise the Lord
[43:52] and Jesus said that he taught within
[43:54] himself though I fear not God not regard
[43:58] man yet because this Widow trouble it
[44:01] means I will avenge her at least by her
[44:04] continuous coming
[44:05] she wears me now Jesus is using this to
[44:10] teach us how we must always pray
[44:16] praise the Lord
[44:18] I remember in the message Mighty
[44:19] conqueror he says uh
[44:21] you know we have not prayed enough until
[44:24] God answered
[44:27] praise the Lord
[44:29] we have not prayed enough you can never
[44:31] get tired until you get a yes or a no
[44:34] from God
[44:37] until you find out what the word of God
[44:39] is you have to continue praying
[44:42] and the Lord said our lord Jesus said
[44:45] hear what the unjust Josh said
[44:49] and shall not God avenge his own village
[44:55] praise the Lord
[44:57] shall not God avenge his sons and his
[45:00] daughter
[45:03] which cry day and night unto him
[45:10] though he beg long with him I tell you
[45:14] that he will avenge them speedily praise
[45:18] God thank you praise the Lord he will
[45:22] avenge them speedily that word is very
[45:25] interesting to me that word speedy light
[45:28] because God's speed is not main speed
[45:31] right
[45:33] God move in Social speed that he he
[45:37] already do it and you are so caught up
[45:39] in your mind that you don't realize it
[45:41] that he have already done it because he
[45:44] said before you even ask
[45:48] he said before you even ask
[45:53] so he's his son he's on social speed
[45:56] amen and uh uh I tell you that he will
[46:02] avenge them speediling amen
[46:06] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[46:10] shall he find faith
[46:13] on the Earth
[46:15] now see here how Jesus
[46:18] is liking him the end time faith
[46:22] to our prayer life
[46:30] praise the Lord let's pray Heavenly
[46:33] Father
[46:33] dear Lord we we just want to thank you
[46:36] tonight
[46:37] and oh God uh we we are so grateful as a
[46:41] people Lord we can always thank you
[46:44] father Lord and uh uh that's how I feed
[46:48] in My Heart Lord Jesus every time of God
[46:51] we come together every time we have the
[46:53] privilege Lord to call upon your name
[46:56] oh God thank you for giving
[47:00] gratefulness in our hearts Lord that we
[47:03] can be able to express it back to you
[47:06] father Lord garden and how many Lord
[47:09] Jesus when when when when they ever
[47:12] think about praying is gesto it's just
[47:15] to burden you with needs and no no
[47:17] consciousness of being thankful no
[47:20] consciousness for father or bringing
[47:22] praise and appreciating you father oh
[47:25] God they are just so burdened Lord they
[47:28] cannot look around them and and never
[47:30] see anything that you have done even o
[47:32] God you are doing so much for us and
[47:35] even the sons of men precious Lord we
[47:38] just ask the blessing upon your word
[47:40] tonight father I want to take this
[47:43] tonight Lord Jesus and and address Lord
[47:46] Brother Braham talking about the three
[47:48] sacrifices that was given to the church
[47:50] so I pray that father you bless the
[47:52] service tonight in Jesus name we pray
[47:55] amen
[47:57] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[47:58] your seat
[48:00] so as we as we fear the need uh uh you
[48:04] know I I talk about talk to
[48:07] talk about uh you know uh talking to the
[48:10] young people
[48:13] but they're not fair they need to just
[48:15] us go through this entire
[48:18] uh a series of messages that brother
[48:20] Brandon preached leading up to marriage
[48:23] and divorce and uh and we we have gone
[48:27] through two uh a man running away from
[48:29] the presence of the Lord which of course
[48:31] brother Brandon was teaching us
[48:33] responsibility in that message and then
[48:36] he comes teaching uh the seed is not
[48:39] held with the shark
[48:40] he brought the three women that were a
[48:43] carrier of the sea that types our body
[48:46] Soul and Spirit
[48:48] amen the types of our body soul in
[48:51] spirit our body was born of adultery
[48:54] there's there's Hager our spirit is the
[48:57] one that the promise was given to that
[48:59] syrup our soul is married virgin but you
[49:03] have to know that she's not the sea amen
[49:05] the word is the seed amen
[49:08] praise the Lord so he he talks about
[49:11] that that uh
[49:15] oh
[49:17] you know their practicing of the Holy
[49:19] Ghost without sensation and that's
[49:21] that's where Mary comes in because
[49:23] Christ was born with our sensation and
[49:26] Christ will be born in the hearts of his
[49:28] bride with our sensation
[49:31] now so uh but tonight we want to look at
[49:34] this woman of uh Luke chapter 18 and uh
[49:39] and just like I said praying now I'll go
[49:42] over what blood Brown said because I
[49:44] feel that is very important the reason
[49:47] why it is important to to be able to
[49:50] follow the the messages before marriage
[49:53] and Devils because it helps you to be
[49:56] able to see where brother Brandon was
[49:57] going with this praise the Lord and and
[50:01] many have have pulled out of that
[50:03] message a lot of things there that have
[50:06] been a lot of contradiction all through
[50:09] the years and and people have uh
[50:12] pulled out of that message uh where they
[50:16] think they are broader brand name you
[50:18] know uh taught her uh you know uh the
[50:22] woman being a lesser when he used the
[50:25] word byproduct but there was a
[50:29] misconception you know misunderstanding
[50:31] from many people and uh when brother
[50:35] Brown talks about now being in the
[50:37] original creation uh people
[50:39] misunderstand that but when you follow
[50:42] the messages uh uh
[50:45] before marriage and divorce it helps you
[50:48] it helps you for you to for you to relax
[50:52] and appreciate because people listen to
[50:55] marriage and divorce they are on the
[50:57] edge and they want to see whether you
[51:00] know I'm in the will of God or uh you
[51:01] know are there something wrong or you
[51:03] know my life you know brother I'm going
[51:05] to call out this and and all of that but
[51:08] for you for you for us to just realize
[51:10] that with the hunting question that's
[51:14] been on the prophet of God mind that he
[51:16] took a time to go before the Lord and
[51:19] and bring your word back to the people
[51:21] to be able to address their condition it
[51:24] is not something that should be
[51:26] frightening right there's something
[51:28] there should be relaxing we should be
[51:31] gracious that we have a word that we can
[51:34] go back to praise the Lord amen and I
[51:38] will tell you tonight there the pattern
[51:40] did not only work for 1965. the pattern
[51:44] works tonight
[51:45] [Music]
[51:46] praise the Lord the pardon works tonight
[51:50] amen amen
[51:53] glory be to God so we want to we want to
[51:56] look at this uh this uh this wonderful
[51:59] woman here amen uh what a character you
[52:03] know what a character that I read that
[52:05] quote to you before blood branch is a
[52:07] Praying Woman can do more than a man
[52:10] standing behind appropriate praise the
[52:11] Lord I love that I use that in Zimbabwe
[52:15] when I was there and uh
[52:18] yeah yeah there was there was there was
[52:20] a kind of a very wonderful story that
[52:23] came out of it in uh
[52:26] the the
[52:29] my friend the host Daddy was he was
[52:32] because his daughter was getting married
[52:34] and the wife was was uh trying to help
[52:37] prepare their uh in Australia
[52:40] so she couldn't make it for the meeting
[52:42] so you know they were talking back and
[52:44] forth and she was streaming the service
[52:45] you know so
[52:48] so he says something to her then and
[52:51] then he she pulled that one as a card
[52:53] and sent it back to him he says yeah the
[52:55] Praying Woman can do more than the man
[52:57] behind the pulpit so he started laughing
[53:00] praise the Lord
[53:01] you know so but we thank the Lord
[53:03] tonight but that's exactly what I Think
[53:06] Jesus is uh is bringing to us here just
[53:10] just go back again uh uh as as the
[53:13] scripture says you know Jesus
[53:16] uh intentionally I would say
[53:19] intentionally he lay out this story
[53:22] and the Bible said that men ought to
[53:25] always pray
[53:27] and not to faint
[53:30] praise the Lord
[53:31] no matter how tough the situation is
[53:35] getting to be we we have to pray always
[53:39] praise the lord we have to pray always
[53:42] and and we have to we have to trust the
[53:46] Lord and learn that uh uh praying is not
[53:51] it's not uh
[53:53] a ritual praying is communion
[53:57] amen praying is communion praying is is
[54:01] fellowship is talking to the one that we
[54:05] love to talk into our father talking to
[54:07] our creator you know so uh we uh we you
[54:12] know we you know you you get to the
[54:15] place where sometimes you you get uh in
[54:20] this position where you you you only
[54:22] learn and understand that you know I
[54:24] need to be in a certain position for me
[54:27] to really pray it's true sometimes you
[54:29] just you just got to be away from
[54:31] everything if you really want to be lost
[54:33] in praying I mean you cannot do it
[54:35] anymore you'll be so distracted amen you
[54:38] can pray anymore but you cannot get lost
[54:41] in the morning man you get lost in the
[54:43] in the in the different store not in the
[54:45] spirit
[54:48] right
[54:49] praise the Lord
[54:51] amen in about the thing that is that uh
[54:56] uh just like Paul says you know uh be be
[55:01] instant in season and out of season
[55:02] that's one of the same principle that
[55:05] Jesus is trying to teach us here were
[55:08] men ought to pray and faint net and then
[55:11] he brought the story of this woman you
[55:14] know that uh I mean she would not she
[55:19] would not just give up until what she
[55:22] needs is restored
[55:25] praise the Lord now when I read this
[55:28] story what I think about I think about
[55:30] over in the book of Kings
[55:33] the the Widow
[55:36] that there was coming to the king
[55:40] for her Lane to be restored right
[55:43] praise the Lord amen she came to the
[55:46] king and and of uh you know trying to
[55:49] ask the king and the very moment that
[55:51] she came Elijah Elijah was there
[55:54] testifying
[55:57] of a woman who receive her son back to
[56:00] life
[56:01] praise the Lord and it happens the other
[56:05] uh uh Elijah appointed to the woman here
[56:08] is the will I'm talking about a receiver
[56:10] her son back to life and the King
[56:13] remember that this is a woman that is
[56:15] asking me to Restore Holland
[56:18] so he asks that everything she lost must
[56:20] be restored
[56:22] praise the Lord
[56:23] amen
[56:25] and so you see that uh
[56:30] is a very very very important principle
[56:33] but I want to take it tonight in in
[56:36] going back again uh uh invisible Union
[56:40] to be able to show like blood brand and
[56:43] we'll take the three sacrifices that God
[56:46] gave to the woman he would take it also
[56:48] with the church that's what I want to do
[56:50] tonight so invisible union he starts out
[56:53] yeah he said marriage is the oldest
[56:55] Institute in the world marriage is is
[56:58] marriage was performed first in in an
[57:01] Institute in the Garden of Eden
[57:04] a woman is trusted with certain
[57:08] characters that she must now Define
[57:10] a woman was not even
[57:13] he says uh he says uh even in the
[57:17] beginning of the creation because God
[57:20] knows that she who fall now so you you
[57:25] follow this now
[57:26] and and and just like I said uh when
[57:29] brother Branham used it if you if you
[57:32] look at Genesis 1
[57:34] 26.
[57:36] where he says let us make man in our
[57:39] image male and female then you realize
[57:43] that brother Branham was meaning when
[57:46] God was expressing right
[57:49] Genesis 1 into flesh right
[57:53] that's what he means when she when he
[57:55] says that he was he was talking more in
[57:59] the form of the sequence that he came
[58:02] the man came first before the woman in
[58:05] flesh right but when he made man in
[58:08] Genesis 1 20 says he made man male and
[58:12] female Creator he then praise the Lord
[58:17] sir now so yeah he says see she was a
[58:21] byproduct of a man because but but
[58:26] because she was cast over on this side
[58:31] now you watch that statement now
[58:34] watch that statement she was cast over
[58:37] on this side watch that statement he
[58:40] said she was she has also been giving a
[58:46] sacred charge from God
[58:49] for Redemption
[58:52] so the vet you were giving to her for
[58:55] Redemption now that's the reason why
[58:57] brother Branham is saying she was cast
[58:59] on this side
[59:02] so she never came in the original
[59:06] forming into flesh right God hate her
[59:10] because of redemption right
[59:16] praise the Lord
[59:18] amen
[59:20] yet it was going to be a man that would
[59:23] pay the price but the promise of
[59:25] redemption was given to the woman
[59:28] it was the woman's feet not the mercy
[59:33] praise the Lord and that's the reason
[59:36] why I said in in on Sunday is that God
[59:42] empowered the woman from the beginning
[59:45] in her very making
[59:50] her strength
[59:51] is hiding
[59:57] you know Australia is now the all of
[59:59] this what a man can do a woman can do no
[1:00:01] that's that's not her strength
[1:00:03] is the word not understanding there
[1:00:08] but the strength of a woman is hidden
[1:00:11] signs prove it a woman can multitask
[1:00:14] more than a man because of the way she's
[1:00:17] built
[1:00:19] because of the way she's built she can
[1:00:21] do many things at one take care of the
[1:00:23] children cooking food and everything
[1:00:24] cleaning the house she can must be
[1:00:26] that's the way God made her
[1:00:33] now so
[1:00:37] he said she was cast over in this side
[1:00:41] she has also been giving
[1:00:44] a sacred charge from God for Redemption
[1:00:49] she got
[1:00:50] character that she must not Define if
[1:00:54] she who my them
[1:00:56] she defied for life no matter how much
[1:01:01] she is forgiving she cannot be justified
[1:01:06] now I will come back to that
[1:01:08] and uh
[1:01:11] I will come back to that just like I
[1:01:13] said I'll be able to pick that up again
[1:01:15] I have I have a taught him there not to
[1:01:18] explain it it means what it says but I
[1:01:20] just want to I just want to share some
[1:01:21] things with you on that her body was
[1:01:24] giving to her
[1:01:27] a sacred trust from God
[1:01:31] she is to bring for life into the Earth
[1:01:37] her body is a betting ground for life
[1:01:40] therefore that's the reason
[1:01:43] she's giving this sacred church now so
[1:01:47] you see she she's a life Giver
[1:01:50] all tied to Redemption
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:58] now this is where I want to grab you
[1:02:00] also now I'm speaking now bringing this
[1:02:04] to an illustration
[1:02:07] to show you where the church stands
[1:02:13] praise the Lord
[1:02:15] now you have to realize
[1:02:17] you have to realize that by our natural
[1:02:21] birth
[1:02:23] by our natural birth we are born default
[1:02:28] so God most emphasis is for his
[1:02:33] spiritual church right
[1:02:35] are we together yes
[1:02:37] amen I want I want you to be able to
[1:02:40] grab that in your mind
[1:02:42] praise the Lord
[1:02:43] let me let me say it this way so you can
[1:02:46] be able to understand it a young man or
[1:02:48] the young woman that uh that fall from
[1:02:51] grace and and the devil might have
[1:02:53] rubbed their life into everything when
[1:02:56] they receive Christ and they are born
[1:02:58] again they are more veterans before God
[1:03:00] than the woman that have not divided
[1:03:03] herself and walking in in in on the
[1:03:06] street I mean in pain since she have
[1:03:08] never no man I never touch her but this
[1:03:11] son of God or this daughter of God that
[1:03:13] have repented and have accepted God's
[1:03:16] grace is more ventrous before God
[1:03:21] are you together now amen that's that's
[1:03:25] what I want you to understand
[1:03:27] because brother Branham is bringing this
[1:03:30] thing from a natural standpoint so we
[1:03:32] can be able to understand it but the
[1:03:34] emphasis
[1:03:36] the emphasis is for the church yes sir
[1:03:41] so if we just want to stay with the
[1:03:43] natural part that's where legalism is
[1:03:46] built right
[1:03:50] are we together
[1:03:52] amen the natural is just as important as
[1:03:56] the spiritual but the most the more
[1:03:59] emphasis is for the spiritual right
[1:04:03] just the tip just like the tip we played
[1:04:05] uh the seed is not here with the shot he
[1:04:07] made the same emphasis in that message
[1:04:09] he said you have to watch this because
[1:04:12] this is for the church
[1:04:14] right
[1:04:18] so he says yes I'm speaking now I'm
[1:04:21] bringing this to an illustration to show
[1:04:25] you where the church stands I'm not
[1:04:27] speaking to you woman what whatever you
[1:04:29] are whatever you are that's between you
[1:04:32] and God or you men but I'm speaking of
[1:04:36] the church in Christ
[1:04:40] but when we even tell us here in this
[1:04:42] very same message our invisible Union
[1:04:44] that when Paul uh Romans chapter 7 he
[1:04:49] said Paul use that
[1:04:52] as a prophecy for the church
[1:04:59] are we together
[1:05:00] praise the Lord
[1:05:06] he says I'm speaking
[1:05:08] of the church in Christ and and this
[1:05:13] now this
[1:05:16] is giving to bring for life or she's
[1:05:18] giving this to bring for life they are
[1:05:21] only God himself can give
[1:05:24] she's put in this position
[1:05:27] so you see how
[1:05:30] do you see how
[1:05:32] uh important that is to God
[1:05:36] praise the Lord
[1:05:38] think about it this way and and the
[1:05:40] better way to be able to understand it
[1:05:43] is look at uh uh
[1:05:48] Judges chapter 11.
[1:05:53] Jeff Thai
[1:05:57] making a promise to God that the first
[1:06:00] thing that comes out of my house Lord if
[1:06:01] you give me
[1:06:03] this
[1:06:04] battle
[1:06:06] if you give me victory in this world the
[1:06:08] first thing that come out of my house I
[1:06:09] was sacrificing to you
[1:06:11] this was God's first daughter
[1:06:17] this was the first female
[1:06:19] that came out of the hands of Jehovah
[1:06:25] that's how much
[1:06:29] this subject is important to God
[1:06:33] that's how much the church is important
[1:06:37] to God
[1:06:39] that's how much these three sacrificial
[1:06:43] is important to God
[1:06:50] are we together
[1:06:52] yes sir
[1:06:56] she's giving to bring for Life The Only
[1:06:58] God himself can can give notice
[1:07:03] that has committed to her her sacred
[1:07:06] virtue sacred woman who
[1:07:10] and then sacred motherful
[1:07:14] honor her husband
[1:07:19] what what a sacred trust what a
[1:07:23] responsibility to a woman
[1:07:26] now see why she is a type of the church
[1:07:31] which has
[1:07:33] the same responsibility as a woman has a
[1:07:39] sacred responsibility to her motherhood
[1:07:43] to hovet you to her husband the church
[1:07:46] has the same responsibility to prayer
[1:07:51] to the word
[1:07:53] and to Christ
[1:07:56] praise the Lord do you see why Jesus
[1:08:02] whoa will will take a parable and
[1:08:07] compare
[1:08:08] the constant asking of God a life of
[1:08:13] prayer that man should pray always that
[1:08:16] Jesus will take prayer and liking it or
[1:08:19] qualify it too
[1:08:21] the faith of the son of God
[1:08:27] praise the Lord
[1:08:29] because just as the first virtue is
[1:08:33] important in the life of a young woman
[1:08:35] so prayer is important in the life of
[1:08:38] the church
[1:08:47] praise the Lord
[1:08:48] Jesus says when you pray
[1:08:51] when you stand praying he says forgive
[1:09:00] so you see prayer in itself
[1:09:05] it's an atmosphere
[1:09:07] it's an environment where a person lay
[1:09:10] it's not a ritual that a person does
[1:09:12] ingests and just bubbles some words to
[1:09:15] God
[1:09:16] right
[1:09:18] it's an atmosphere
[1:09:21] it's an environment that you live in
[1:09:27] and to be healthy in that environment
[1:09:30] you cannot be healthy if you are holding
[1:09:33] things in your hearts
[1:09:37] if you're having unforgiving spirit
[1:09:44] praise the Lord
[1:09:51] just like how
[1:09:55] you see that's the reason why the devil
[1:09:58] will defy the church
[1:10:00] if the church lost his prayer life if a
[1:10:02] Believer lost lost
[1:10:05] his time or her time with having
[1:10:08] communion with God
[1:10:12] it must not be on the family devotion it
[1:10:14] must not be on the church prayer meeting
[1:10:16] it must be something that we have
[1:10:19] private to ourselves
[1:10:23] I love to wake up in in 6 a.m in the
[1:10:26] morning and pray with the family I love
[1:10:28] to uh to come to prayer meeting but
[1:10:31] above all I love my own personal time
[1:10:34] with God right
[1:10:38] right
[1:10:39] I lost my own personal time with God
[1:10:48] praise the Lord
[1:10:51] a man must pray it always and faith in
[1:10:54] that
[1:10:57] when the son of man cometh
[1:10:59] will he find faith
[1:11:01] he's not going to find faith in a
[1:11:04] prayerless church
[1:11:07] you know true he's not going to find
[1:11:10] Rapture in faith in the people that have
[1:11:12] no relationship no connection no
[1:11:15] communion with God
[1:11:18] how can we have rapturing faith
[1:11:21] when there is no communion
[1:11:29] are we together
[1:11:31] you see when the enemy can just get our
[1:11:34] minds so cut up and stop in the physical
[1:11:38] where we just looking at the physical
[1:11:40] flesh and the physical requirement of a
[1:11:42] woman and we can use that and blast and
[1:11:44] talk all of that instead of spending
[1:11:46] time on our knees
[1:11:48] sir Amen in praying for our wives and
[1:11:52] praying for our daughters and praying
[1:11:54] for our sister
[1:12:07] praise the Lord
[1:12:09] oh yes that prophet of God told us how
[1:12:12] much uh uh uh uh since since Eden
[1:12:17] since Eden Eden show it to us
[1:12:21] the enemy attacked the precious life of
[1:12:24] the woman
[1:12:27] and in the day and in this day and age
[1:12:30] that we are living we see it all over us
[1:12:35] because he knows
[1:12:42] he knows
[1:12:44] brother Brown says he knows the
[1:12:45] principle of life
[1:12:48] he knows
[1:12:50] the power that is in these virtues you
[1:12:54] know the devil knows that
[1:12:57] the power that is in these virtues
[1:13:09] when a woman can stand on it that's
[1:13:11] that's the reason why the prophet of God
[1:13:12] said over and over
[1:13:14] he says uh motherhood is the backbone to
[1:13:17] the nation
[1:13:22] this is the backbone to the nation
[1:13:32] so how we how we we need to trust the
[1:13:35] Lord and and and cultivate more time to
[1:13:38] spend with God in praying
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:49] what a sacred trust what a
[1:13:51] responsibility to a woman now see why
[1:13:54] she's a type of the church she has a
[1:13:57] responsibility as a as a woman
[1:14:02] has a soccer responsibility to her
[1:14:06] motherhood to convert you to her husband
[1:14:09] the church has has a sacral
[1:14:12] responsibility to to prayer told the
[1:14:16] word
[1:14:17] and to Christ you know
[1:14:19] for a long time I saw as a young
[1:14:21] believer that I struggle with honestly
[1:14:24] to the word into Christ I said but
[1:14:26] that's the same
[1:14:29] praise the Lord
[1:14:31] but it's more than that people
[1:14:34] it's more than that
[1:14:38] amen it's more than that because it's so
[1:14:42] it's so easy for us to conform
[1:14:45] to the word and conform to to the
[1:14:48] doctrine and have no relationship right
[1:14:52] right that to Christ is our personal
[1:14:54] relationship with the person of Jesus
[1:14:57] Christ
[1:15:04] because the word must be put in flesh
[1:15:10] now that's what the church is also
[1:15:15] in the same condition she's a type
[1:15:18] she has the same precious virtue by
[1:15:22] Spirit giving to her to preserve the
[1:15:26] spirit and the word
[1:15:28] and never commit adultery with anything
[1:15:31] of the word
[1:15:34] or anything
[1:15:36] State virgin told the word as a woman is
[1:15:41] to stay virtuous to her husband
[1:15:46] praise the Lord now you think about this
[1:15:49] now let me let me let me ride with you a
[1:15:51] little bit on this
[1:15:53] you ever said that uh uh God has
[1:15:57] redeemed us from such and an evil were
[1:15:59] born in Saint simply in iniquity just
[1:16:02] like just like I said our spirit was
[1:16:05] marked
[1:16:07] amen
[1:16:08] our spirit was defined by our natural
[1:16:10] birth let me see it that way because we
[1:16:13] come into the word speaking speaking
[1:16:15] lies
[1:16:15] but you see like the prophet of God
[1:16:18] saying here is that uh when when when
[1:16:20] God redeemed us when when he saved us
[1:16:23] through our faith and confession in
[1:16:26] Jesus Christ and he has brought us to
[1:16:28] himself and and and and and have given
[1:16:31] us his spirit for us to come into such a
[1:16:35] fellowship such a relationship with him
[1:16:38] he looked at us as a veterans bride yeah
[1:16:44] praise the Lord he looked at us because
[1:16:47] this is under the very same message
[1:16:48] where brother brand preached that he
[1:16:50] looked at us as a bride that has been
[1:16:53] Justified
[1:16:55] right
[1:16:57] and that's why Paul preached there
[1:16:58] justified by faith our faith raised us
[1:17:01] up to such a place where we are now
[1:17:04] honored no condemnation unto them that
[1:17:07] are in Christ we are not dealing with
[1:17:09] guilt in and out today I'm saved
[1:17:10] tomorrow I'm condemned no he raised us
[1:17:13] up
[1:17:14] yeah
[1:17:16] so that core equalness John hears with
[1:17:19] cracks
[1:17:24] praise the Lord
[1:17:31] and that's some of the things that have
[1:17:33] failed in uh in in in in many of our
[1:17:36] marriage relationship
[1:17:38] what a man has not been able to have
[1:17:41] that Grace to be able to raise his wife
[1:17:43] up
[1:17:47] praise the Lord he's just looking for
[1:17:48] the next occasion to go back okay that's
[1:17:50] why you did that I see that's why you
[1:17:52] did that right
[1:18:02] are we together
[1:18:04] now that's the reason why I'm saying
[1:18:06] there there is is this this is a very
[1:18:09] good foundation
[1:18:13] I'll tell you many years ago that was
[1:18:15] that was my experience
[1:18:18] there was a subject I was struggling
[1:18:20] with in the message
[1:18:23] and I mean I said it I I whatever
[1:18:26] material that I had in the message I
[1:18:28] looked through I looked through I just
[1:18:30] fell to myself I said for some reason
[1:18:34] I I I just they were just a need I just
[1:18:37] I said Lord I Need Your Grace to help me
[1:18:40] understand this
[1:18:42] and the Lord just laid on my heart to
[1:18:44] him to steady the entire series leading
[1:18:47] up to marriage in their voice
[1:18:51] praise the Lord
[1:18:54] and God will not tell you to do
[1:18:55] something like that unless he has an
[1:18:57] answer for you
[1:18:59] and there the Lord just helped me to see
[1:19:01] it
[1:19:02] praise the Lord I realize that all of
[1:19:04] those years are because of legalizing
[1:19:07] that have come into the message most of
[1:19:09] the people did not go they never went
[1:19:11] into the field they stopped right at the
[1:19:12] bridge right they couldn't cross right
[1:19:15] they stop they stop other do's and
[1:19:18] don'ts
[1:19:20] right and they couldn't cross to go in
[1:19:22] the seals and see what the labor type
[1:19:26] the Deliverance in healing that the
[1:19:29] message has brought
[1:19:40] it's all about this virtuous bride
[1:19:43] this bride that has been redeemed by a
[1:19:45] better blood
[1:19:50] then the blood of our fathers and mother
[1:19:54] a better sacrifice a better coveting
[1:19:58] it's all about this bride
[1:20:03] it is not about our self-achievement
[1:20:14] praise the Lord
[1:20:16] now that's what the church is also
[1:20:19] she's in that same condition she's a
[1:20:22] type
[1:20:23] she has the same precious that you buy
[1:20:27] the spirit given to her to preserve the
[1:20:30] spirit and the word that's the thing
[1:20:33] that keeps the church
[1:20:35] is now us trying to do buddy buddy buddy
[1:20:38] buddy don't keep the church it's the
[1:20:39] spirit and the word that keeps the
[1:20:41] church
[1:20:41] [Music]
[1:20:46] trying to know it that's not why it
[1:20:48] keeps the church what keeps the church
[1:20:50] is the spirit and the word
[1:20:52] yes sir
[1:20:59] and that's why we are giving that
[1:21:04] we have to be in prayer
[1:21:08] the preacher has to pray for you you
[1:21:10] have to pray for the preacher
[1:21:15] because we are all in this together it's
[1:21:18] a spiritual warfare
[1:21:20] praise the Lord
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:25] but now remember now we're trying to
[1:21:27] keep this woman
[1:21:30] that Jesus spoke about here
[1:21:34] how her continues her continuous coming
[1:21:37] to the judge
[1:21:39] is a type of us never giving up on
[1:21:42] anybody never giving up on any situation
[1:21:47] always believe in God trusting God
[1:21:51] confessing the promises
[1:21:58] amen praise the Lord
[1:22:00] amen you have to realize that brother
[1:22:03] Branham says when love projects yeah
[1:22:06] When Love projects He says then
[1:22:10] Sovereign Grace takes over
[1:22:15] and that's what prayer does it brings up
[1:22:18] the love of God and IT projects a
[1:22:22] Deliverance for the person IT projects
[1:22:24] healing for the person IT projects a a
[1:22:27] God moving on the scene for the person
[1:22:30] then the Sovereign Grace of God goes to
[1:22:33] work
[1:22:35] but you you can net you you are not
[1:22:38] projecting when when you when you go up
[1:22:40] writing says yeah I keep praying for you
[1:22:42] but you keep doing that same thing
[1:22:49] praise the Lord sure
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:57] just like the projector there it does
[1:22:59] not have no letters in it
[1:23:03] praise the Lord yeah it comes from back
[1:23:06] there sister fading and they're all they
[1:23:08] just they just stop some few kids and
[1:23:10] they go straight on the wall yeah
[1:23:16] it does not make up your mind and say no
[1:23:19] I'm not that's that's not the one I want
[1:23:20] to project
[1:23:23] send it go back send me send me the the
[1:23:26] next no it does not
[1:23:28] praise the Lord yeah
[1:23:31] amen
[1:23:36] we have to project the promises yes God
[1:23:39] this is what your word said
[1:23:42] believe on the Lord Jesus me and my
[1:23:45] household will be safe that's why your
[1:23:47] word says
[1:23:58] and just read me a quote today brother
[1:23:59] Brian says where he says what happened
[1:24:01] he says he says that is that's the same
[1:24:03] thing for healing he says your faith
[1:24:05] will project
[1:24:08] and heal you
[1:24:09] your body is saved by your feet will
[1:24:12] create a projection of you being healed
[1:24:17] he says and then now they will take your
[1:24:19] sick body to go and meet your well body
[1:24:26] because every time you go to pray every
[1:24:28] time you are not looking at this body
[1:24:30] you are looking at that body that is
[1:24:32] well
[1:24:32] [Music]
[1:24:33] you are looking at that person that has
[1:24:36] overcome
[1:24:39] you are looking at that son or daughter
[1:24:41] that is Victory you are not looking at
[1:24:43] the one that is giving you trouble you
[1:24:45] are looking at the one that faith has
[1:24:46] already project
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:50] yes sir
[1:24:53] praise the Lord
[1:24:56] you see that's why brother one brother
[1:24:57] by him preached perfect Faith yeah he
[1:24:59] talks about he says he says that he says
[1:25:02] there are wolves that will now be able
[1:25:04] to grab it
[1:25:05] he said they will not grasit they would
[1:25:08] struggle there was struggle he says but
[1:25:10] that's the place where God brings
[1:25:12] perfect through the bride
[1:25:18] it puts us to that place it puts you to
[1:25:21] that place word uh I mean because what
[1:25:24] happened is that uh that's the that's
[1:25:26] the thing that religion does all through
[1:25:28] the church
[1:25:31] when those things are happening then you
[1:25:33] start disassociating yourself from this
[1:25:36] person because you think that person is
[1:25:37] bad I've been praying for them they
[1:25:39] don't want to be they don't want to be
[1:25:40] yeah I mean it's not working
[1:25:42] yeah
[1:25:44] praise the Lord
[1:25:46] but you see perfect raise you up to the
[1:25:48] place where it have created a vision and
[1:25:52] in that Vision you see this person
[1:25:54] better than what they are now so being
[1:25:58] around them does not bother you right
[1:26:02] it does not bother you you don't have
[1:26:04] complex
[1:26:08] because your faith has provided a vision
[1:26:12] and what you are looking at you are
[1:26:14] looking at the invisible not the visible
[1:26:17] [Laughter]
[1:26:20] you are looking at the invisible
[1:26:23] every time you stick around and you give
[1:26:25] them a hug that that picture comes back
[1:26:27] to your mind
[1:26:29] you see them better than what they are
[1:26:31] now
[1:26:31] sure
[1:26:35] praise the Lord how do we come to that
[1:26:38] faith
[1:26:39] continuous praying
[1:26:42] continuous praying
[1:26:45] yes sir
[1:26:50] how do we come to that place
[1:26:55] realizing the ancient time that we are
[1:26:57] living in all the things that are
[1:26:59] happening
[1:27:00] and everything that is happening around
[1:27:02] us
[1:27:06] or even the devil or something I want to
[1:27:09] use the ones that you love the most
[1:27:12] right
[1:27:15] the ones that you love the most
[1:27:21] praise the Lord why because he want to
[1:27:24] damage that place in you
[1:27:26] where you can never rise to the place to
[1:27:29] ever think positive about that person
[1:27:40] for Faith perfect faith is a vision of
[1:27:42] Faith
[1:27:44] it's a vision Faith it's not a muff
[1:27:47] talking Faith people it's a vision fact
[1:27:54] it's not a mouth talking faith
[1:28:00] and I praise the Lord
[1:28:03] your man ought to pray
[1:28:06] a faint gnat
[1:28:09] because as soon as
[1:28:12] you break into the vision is over
[1:28:15] it's over as soon as you break into the
[1:28:18] vision and the Holy Ghost can project
[1:28:20] and show you
[1:28:23] yeah it's over
[1:28:26] praise the Lord It's Over
[1:28:33] say brother man I've never seen that
[1:28:36] animal
[1:28:36] that you are talking about I've hunted
[1:28:38] all of this mountain I've never seen it
[1:28:40] but say it was a vision
[1:28:42] if it is not yet maybe it's somewhere
[1:28:44] else but I've seen the vision and it
[1:28:47] never failed
[1:28:48] even though a terrorist but it never
[1:28:50] fail because it always speak for itself
[1:28:53] and that's what happened when perfect
[1:28:55] raise you up to the place where it had
[1:28:58] created a vision yeah
[1:29:01] praise the Lord
[1:29:03] all things will happen the church were
[1:29:05] rocking and paint some oh Peppa Pig has
[1:29:08] created a vision
[1:29:10] praise the Lord we're going to stay with
[1:29:13] that Vision than to follow your emotion
[1:29:15] and all of your destruction no we're
[1:29:17] going to stay with that Vision because
[1:29:19] it never fails
[1:29:23] praise the Lord
[1:29:24] you see that's the reason why you don't
[1:29:26] you don't you don't you I mean you are
[1:29:28] not moved but oh yeah I mean 10 person
[1:29:30] come to church today oh the church is
[1:29:32] growing you know many people no no no no
[1:29:34] no no you get a vision yes there's a
[1:29:37] vision of where we are going
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:42] the vision is not about how many people
[1:29:44] it's about where we are going
[1:29:49] praise the Lord
[1:29:51] amen
[1:29:53] amen ought to pray always
[1:29:55] and faint net
[1:30:00] and faintness
[1:30:03] because when the son of man cometh
[1:30:05] those are the kind of for people
[1:30:08] that we have the son of man faith
[1:30:11] in the hour of the son of man
[1:30:13] praise the Lord
[1:30:15] amen amen most of these people that have
[1:30:18] you know are saying all of these things
[1:30:20] and falling on the Wayside you know they
[1:30:22] were they were just they were just
[1:30:24] hoping that a Rapture come quickly
[1:30:26] just like brother Branham says here he
[1:30:28] says I was I was honored I was on a
[1:30:30] depression I was saying oh my God Lord
[1:30:32] my wife told my wife I just want to go
[1:30:34] to be with the Lord the Holy Ghost said
[1:30:36] you want to bypass it right you want to
[1:30:39] bypass the test
[1:30:41] amen yeah
[1:30:46] glory be to God
[1:30:48] are you afraid of Philly
[1:30:53] are you afraid is it there's a fear in
[1:30:55] you that you will fail
[1:30:59] you know what helps you to overcome your
[1:31:01] fear is a vision right
[1:31:05] it's a vision
[1:31:08] praise the Lord
[1:31:09] by the word raise you to a place where
[1:31:11] you have a vision
[1:31:15] it helps you to overcome your fear
[1:31:19] praise the Lord when the devil brings
[1:31:22] down you say when I fought I Rise Again
[1:31:24] I see myself there I have to get there
[1:31:27] because I've seen it
[1:31:34] praise the Lord
[1:31:39] so you see
[1:31:43] that is the kind of a virtue
[1:31:48] you you read about uh
[1:31:52] people that spend their time with the
[1:31:55] Lord in praying
[1:31:56] you know and just like I said you know
[1:31:59] Birdman says here you know I read that
[1:32:02] because I was going to come back to it
[1:32:03] he talks about uh
[1:32:07] she got a character that she she must
[1:32:10] not Define
[1:32:12] and if if she will mind that she defined
[1:32:16] she defied for life now so you're just
[1:32:20] like we took the the the spiritual part
[1:32:23] he's talking about a physical woman yeah
[1:32:26] we we took the spiritual part of Faith
[1:32:28] you realize that uh I mean that's why we
[1:32:32] have all of these you know constant
[1:32:34] fighting until you know uh the Rapture
[1:32:37] or our last birth we will keep fighting
[1:32:39] right amen because like the prophet said
[1:32:43] you know Christ is revealing this whole
[1:32:45] in his own word he says there's a place
[1:32:47] now every one of us he says they don't
[1:32:49] have the right to that place he says and
[1:32:51] that is a place that we have to keep
[1:32:53] under the blood where did it come from
[1:32:55] from our our natural birth
[1:33:00] amen it comes from our natural birth so
[1:33:04] you see so it is it is other place where
[1:33:06] you will uh uh yeah I'm I'm kind of for
[1:33:09] trusting the Lord to keep me here I
[1:33:11] don't want to get so much and take much
[1:33:13] of your time tonight but it is at a
[1:33:16] place where you you learn and start
[1:33:18] seeing how to appreciate the grace of
[1:33:20] God
[1:33:21] amen
[1:33:23] just like I said on Sunday you know uh
[1:33:26] uh I mean uh people like brother Brown
[1:33:29] says we read that you know uh you don't
[1:33:32] we we don't know the story behind those
[1:33:34] women
[1:33:35] right but yet they had the best
[1:33:40] story of redemption
[1:33:42] you know
[1:33:44] we don't know about him try to give us a
[1:33:46] glance of the story behind those women
[1:33:48] the rehab
[1:33:49] uh other parents and some of the things
[1:33:52] that was going on they put their dollar
[1:33:54] in the street to you know to make money
[1:33:57] but yeah there was a predestinated seed
[1:33:59] in her
[1:34:01] right praise the Lord
[1:34:03] amen so you see that there are places
[1:34:06] where uh uh uh uh when it comes even to
[1:34:10] to the to the to the Natural Woman I
[1:34:13] mean there are some I mean because of
[1:34:15] whatever their experience was uh uh you
[1:34:18] know uh they never had the grace to to
[1:34:21] go right into marriage you know uh uh in
[1:34:24] in the virtual state but God has given
[1:34:26] them the grace to to to to be blessed
[1:34:29] with their Womanhood
[1:34:31] after they have been safe
[1:34:34] you tell me about decency
[1:34:38] praise the Lord
[1:34:40] amen now you think about this
[1:34:44] she gets so decent
[1:34:47] and so honorable
[1:34:49] that there is no way to be able to
[1:34:52] associate her
[1:34:55] with a miserable life in the past
[1:35:00] that's right
[1:35:01] amen yeah
[1:35:05] some went through all a source of
[1:35:08] struggle
[1:35:09] but yet they are such a mother to their
[1:35:12] children
[1:35:15] praise the Lord sure
[1:35:17] mother such an example
[1:35:23] so you see what I'm saying here is that
[1:35:26] uh some of the the wrong teachings that
[1:35:30] have gone with this right that people
[1:35:33] misunderstand this in in their but I
[1:35:35] said Broadband says you are defiled for
[1:35:36] life so which means that it just it just
[1:35:39] destroys you all everywhere of your life
[1:35:43] I mean if you even bring it if you even
[1:35:45] bring it back to the bride of Christ
[1:35:51] after we've been safe
[1:35:55] praise the Lord
[1:35:57] amen I mean I I saw some of some of the
[1:36:00] some of the brothers that they don't
[1:36:01] tell you the their testimony you will
[1:36:03] never even know that uh I mean they have
[1:36:05] they have ever done anything wrong
[1:36:07] sure right
[1:36:11] because the grace of God raises a man up
[1:36:13] to such to such a place
[1:36:16] her we are now putting on the church
[1:36:18] name we are putting on the name of Jesus
[1:36:21] Christ
[1:36:29] the Lord
[1:36:33] you see that I mean just like I said on
[1:36:35] Sunday I mean where do you go then you
[1:36:37] hear people teaching on the three
[1:36:39] sacraments you like the way brother
[1:36:40] Branham taught him
[1:36:42] that's the reason why in marriage in
[1:36:45] that voice he brings out the point of
[1:36:47] misinterpreted your logic
[1:36:49] right some of the things that were that
[1:36:52] were taught wrong
[1:36:56] where do you go that you heard that I
[1:36:59] mean what what what book what what
[1:37:00] preacher out there
[1:37:02] that ever is able to take this
[1:37:05] apply it to the church and talks about
[1:37:08] why God gave it to the woman
[1:37:16] you won't you will not find it
[1:37:20] you will not find it because all of
[1:37:22] these things are tied back to the seals
[1:37:25] they attack back to the Mysteries right
[1:37:28] it's something that has been a mystery
[1:37:31] yes sir praise the Lord is being a
[1:37:34] mystery a little girl uh as small as she
[1:37:38] is and uh she always have her daughter
[1:37:42] it's in her to be a mother
[1:37:45] right
[1:37:47] she has that mystery in her to be a
[1:37:50] mother
[1:37:53] as soon as she started getting up eight
[1:37:56] uh 9 10 12 years old she started
[1:37:59] becoming very particular of what she
[1:38:01] want to wear
[1:38:04] why make sure to do that Womanhood
[1:38:11] she wants to appeared nice
[1:38:14] she do her hair like this
[1:38:16] what makes her to do that
[1:38:19] because it's in her
[1:38:23] praise the Lord
[1:38:25] because but all down through the the
[1:38:27] ages the the the the the light of God
[1:38:30] never shine on this subject for
[1:38:33] preachers to to pick it up
[1:38:35] yeah right praise the Lord
[1:38:39] some you know I knew that it was it was
[1:38:43] important you look over in the Old
[1:38:44] Testament you see the important that I
[1:38:47] mean that that a young woman must leave
[1:38:48] her father house to her husband house
[1:38:51] right
[1:38:55] praise the Lord
[1:38:58] even beside that there were there are
[1:39:01] cultures that that that that that teach
[1:39:03] that also
[1:39:04] sure
[1:39:05] Robert Brownwood talks about coming from
[1:39:07] South Africa and seeing some of the
[1:39:09] things that were don't be which he said
[1:39:11] it would be a shame if that ever is
[1:39:13] trying
[1:39:15] so those things were in nature
[1:39:18] so brother Brandon bringing it it was
[1:39:21] not like a law to the church but it was
[1:39:23] to show us
[1:39:25] this is the same thing that the Church
[1:39:27] of God is lacking you know
[1:39:32] it's the same thing that the Believers
[1:39:34] like he will never live an overcoming
[1:39:36] life if he does not have Devotion to
[1:39:40] prayer to the word and a relationship
[1:39:42] with Jesus Christ he can never live an
[1:39:45] overcoming life he can only live a
[1:39:48] church life
[1:39:50] he can live a church life he can fight
[1:39:52] for the message the prophet says this is
[1:39:54] that that's how it's supposed to be and
[1:39:56] then but he can never live an overcoming
[1:39:59] life
[1:40:01] true
[1:40:04] because a man
[1:40:06] not living an overcoming life we knows
[1:40:09] in his heart
[1:40:12] the things that he's guilty of
[1:40:15] that's why when Jesus says he said
[1:40:17] anyone among you that have not seen you
[1:40:19] cast the first stone
[1:40:22] praise the Lord they were holding the
[1:40:25] courts the prophet said this woman must
[1:40:28] be stoned
[1:40:30] but they were not living and overcoming
[1:40:32] life
[1:40:33] amen right they were all guilty
[1:40:38] and the Word was able to pick up guilt
[1:40:40] in them
[1:40:48] young people this this is not for you to
[1:40:50] strive this is to make you an overcomer
[1:40:52] mom is to make you an overcomer
[1:40:57] now for you to be afraid and what what
[1:40:59] is going to happen if I if I get a job
[1:41:01] no
[1:41:02] you have to have an experience with
[1:41:04] Christ
[1:41:05] to know that when you are stepping out
[1:41:08] there you are a son of God and Heaven is
[1:41:10] behind you
[1:41:13] [Music]
[1:41:24] praise the Lord

[1:41:57] Coronavirus
[1:41:59] you find people
[1:42:01] they have sought in message churches

[1:42:06] being afraid are we in the tribulation
[1:42:08] oh my God the tribulation we tribulation
[1:42:11] has come I miss the rapture
[1:42:17] they were just in church
[1:42:19] they had no relationship with Christ
[1:42:23] if you have a relationship with Christ
[1:42:25] you know there is no Rapture without you
[1:42:30] praise the Lord amen but I want I know
