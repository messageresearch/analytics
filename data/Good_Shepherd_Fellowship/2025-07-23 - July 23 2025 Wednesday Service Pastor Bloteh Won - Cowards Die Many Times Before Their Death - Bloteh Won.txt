We want to thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity to be together tonight. We have a few prayer needs that we want to take up uh quickly tonight before we go into our Praise the Lord. Okay. But first, we want to once again greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus. And good to have you all in the service tonight. And we also greet those that are streaming in the service.

Even though it was not a planned trip, but uh they really enjoy the fellowship. They enjoy the people. They enjoy the services and they also enjoy the blessings and we thank the Lord for that. Amen. Praise the Lord. So uh uh I think this evening uh uh sister Joy the her mother and and sister get in this evening and uh I'm not seeing her. So I think uh that's that should be one of the reason. And uh sister Naomi also sent a text. Uh she and brother Jordan is uh talking with the folks working at her house there. So we we want to remember them in prayer. They're not here with us tonight. And uh spoke with brother Wesley yesterday. uh um he called for us to remember uh brother Cra and and and sister April. Now that that was a family that was always joining them in Illinois. Every time one time they were there in Illinois, that family would come over at their house to be able to stream the service together because they did not have a church in that area. So, uh, uh, Brother Wesley called yesterday and it looks like, uh, the sister is, uh, beginning to deal with, uh, uh, something that looks like a mental problem. And, uh, so we want to, we want to stand in the gap for her tonight, whatsoever that is bothering her mind, battering her spirit, that the Lord will be able to step in and uh, and just break the curses. Amen. Praise the Lord. And uh uh Brother Wesley is supposed to go in uh also uh uh to be able to uh uh treat his second eyes. He went in uh I think last week or so for one of the eye. They kind of give him an a steroid in his eyes. So they want to do the second one. And uh uh we are hoping and praying that uh it will kind of a work for him to be able to see better. And uh we will also continue to remember uh Sister Cara. She's supposed to go in on the 29th. Um uh for them to be able to um they also want to check her heart uh and then uh the situation with her knees. So we want to bring all of that to the Lord in prayer tonight. Is there any an unspoken prayer request in our midst tonight? You want to do that by an uplifted hands can see there from the back. Yeah. Uh yes. Yes. [Music] That is all I long for. I want to take few prayer needs here. Also praying tonight for uh the owner of Tracy uh business property. She's uh is at uh large tonight and is scheduled for emergency surgery in the morning.

Amen. &gt;&gt; You can make it personal if you want to make it personal. &gt;&gt; And I like personal worship &gt;&gt; because Jesus said the truth worshipper will worship him in spirit and in truth. You might have different words up here and I'm singing something different. I feel good about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If I'm confusing you, don't get confused. Just get in the spirit of worship. That's all. Amen. You don't have to be confused. Just get in the spirit of worship. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Let's take our Bibles tonight. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, brother Ara. Sister Joy, thank you. Aha. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Glory be to God. Glory be to God. And uh let's start our our let's start our preaching tonight. I want to preach on something that is uh that has been long said and and then uh brother Brandon echo a few times. I want to talk on the cow die many times before their death. Amen. The cow died many times before their death when actually we were reading from uh uh uh the book of Ecclesiastic and you remember the the Bible said don't be foolish and wicked and die you die before your time &gt;&gt; and that verse has been the most ideal religious voice nobody can die before their time you know people don't die but the Bible say people can die before their time you know and everything is there So I think the only person that died before their time is a cow. &gt;&gt; So that's what I choose to preach on there tonight. &gt;&gt; A cow die many times before their death. 2 Samuel chapter 3. 2 Samuel chapter 3. You know when you you take those kind of a things and and you just preach on the verse, it's easy for people to to argue. But when when you preach your inspiration, then it's your inspiration. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I would just want to preach my inspiration tonight. There's no need of fussing. There's no need of arguing. Let's just enjoy the fellowship of the Lord. Tonight, we read from 2 Samuel chapter 3. Let's read from verse 30. 2 Samuel chapter 3. We will read from verse 30. And so Joab and the Abishad his brothers sold Abnne because he has slain their brother Aahel at Gibian in the battle. And David said to Joab and to all the people that were with him, "Rent your clothes and g you with sackcloth and moon before Abna." And King David himself followed the bird which mean he spread himself on the ground. He just don't he he did not only just tell the people to mourn but he got into the into the art of mourning. That word means that he he himself spray himself on the ground and started to weep. Praise the Lord. And uh uh okay, I kind of a little strike here. Okay, verse 32. And they buried Abnad in Hebrew. And the king lifted up his his voice and wept at the grave of Abnne. And all the people wept. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the king lamented over Abnne and said, "Die, Abnne, as a fool dareth." Thy hands were not bound, none thy feet put into filter. As a man fallth before wicked men, so fall down, and all the people wept again over him. David is saying these words and is just making the people to be emotional. If you know if you we will talk a little bit about the background of of what David is saying and then you'll be able to get the picture. Ecclesiastes chapter 7. Let's read u uh that famous verse there from from the preacher. We'll read that famous verse there from the preacher and then uh uh we will chapter 7. Praise the Lord. Chapter 7 verse 17. Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish. Why should I die before that time? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in another sense, wickedness is foolishness before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the two is the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wickedness is foolishness before God. We'll look at that also in the type. And let's look at Revelation chapter 21. Revelation chapter 21 tonight. Revelation chapter 21. Let's read verse five. Revelation 21, reading from verse 5. [Music] And he that sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And he said unto me, "Write, for these words are truth and faithful." And he said unto me, "It is done." Which mean, it is finished. Amen. I'm the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is at thirst or the fountains of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's read that verse 17 again. He that overcomemeth shall inherit all things and I will be his god and he shall be my son. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh son not only in the sense of uh just a man or the male or the boy but he will be my child. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here said God is giving a promise here. He that overcome it. He that overcometh, I don't care what it is. &gt;&gt; What it is, he that overcomemeth, he's saying he that overcometh all things. I can even say he that overcometh anything. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because you see, it is not just one thing that we will overcome. &gt;&gt; When you finish with one, another one is waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when you overcome one, you must be able to overcome the other one. You see, you cannot only survive on the testimony of what you overcome yesterday. &gt;&gt; It's what you are overcoming today. It's what you will overcome tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even on our dying bed, we will overcome. &gt;&gt; Because we will say death, where is your stain? &gt;&gt; Grave, where is your victory? &gt;&gt; Thank be unto Jesus that gave us the victory. So he that overcome shall inherit all things and I will be his God, and he will be my son. But the fearful, the fearful, the foolish, the cow, that's what that word means. The fearful, the foolish, the cow, and they're unbelieving. &gt;&gt; So you see, cowardness is an attribute of uh of unbelief. When a person really don't believe God for who he is and is backing up on God's promises, &gt;&gt; then he's a cow. But the fearful, Amen. The fearful, the unbelieving, the abominable, the murderers, the homongers, the sorcerers, the idolattors, the liars shall have their part in the lake of fire. They'll have their part in the lake which burned with fire and brimstones, which is the second death. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, so to the cow, there is no resurrection that is promised. &gt;&gt; Right? So that's the reason why we want to nail the coward tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to deal with cowardness tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And before you sit down, uh let's let's just read this together. Uh praise the Lord. Uh expectation. Expectation. And I was I was listening to this message and that's where I took my my mine uh my inspiration from tonight. The message expectation. Brother Brandham say he says we we are going towards the dark chamber. We are going towards the dark chamber. We were singing the song uh into the chamber. Be free. Holy Spirit speak to me gently as I close the door. But he's talking about a dark chamber here. We are going towards a dark chamber, a chamber of death. Everyone enter that chamber. And every time our heartbeat, we go one step closer. Some days I shall enter that chamber. And when I get down to the last habitat, I do not want to go in there as a cow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go I don't want to face death as a cow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are all going to die if Jesus tried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he tries, we might go by the word of death. and uh and some will stay to be translated. Praise the Lord. But it won't change anything. Amen. For the believer, it will not change anything. &gt;&gt; If we drop dead here, we get our body changed. We step into a a founding body on the other side. And uh but the main thing here is how do we go towards that chamber? Brother Brandham says, "I do not want to go in there as a cow. I want to wrap myself in his righteousness. I want to pull it up around me and enter that chamber to know him in the power of his resurrection." &gt;&gt; Do you feel the same tonight? &gt;&gt; You want to know him in the power of his resurrection? &gt;&gt; Then let's say, "Come with me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you tonight. You may have your seat. The Lord bless you tonight. You may have your seat. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if you if you take the the uh a little bit of a history back here and you look at the life of uh of Abna, Abnner was the captain of the army of Saul because he was a Benjamite. You see those days men would choose their general. Sometimes they are men from their family like uh Joab. Joab was uh he was a relative to David. He was related to David. And that's the same with Abna. Abna was the captain of Saul army and Joab was the captain of David's army. Amen. He was a captain of David's men. So uh uh uh that that is that is the picture here. But if you if you look at this character of this man David, you look at the character of this man David, you go back when David went down to the place where Saul was and and he was able to find himself in the in the in the in the in the in the cave and he caught Saul G. When he came up when he yelled, he he called Abnner. He says, "You are the captain. How did you manage that I was able to cut your master garment? Because you supposed to be protecting this man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and in a way it it was it was in one sense it was degrading but in another sense it was challenging because you have to remember that David respected Saul because he was an anointed of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And touch not my anointing and do my prophet no harm. Praise the Lord. David said, you know, God God reminded Israel that all along traveling. So he kept that in his mind. He was not going to touch Saul. He was not going to kill Saul. But moreover, he was concerned that the man that's supposed to be the gatekeeper, the man that's supposed to be the the protector. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the captain of the guide. How did you manage that I enter? I went as close as to your master &gt;&gt; and I cut off his garment. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you remember when Saul and Jonathan died, David did not rejoice. &gt;&gt; There was a young man of uh of uh of uh the the Ammonites that was that was so foolish. He was trying to gain favor with David. He ran down into the camp and he says he's losing his birth. Oh yeah, David, I I came I brought you news and uh uh Saul and Jonathan is killed. He make up his own story for his own death. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was another cowardness. &gt;&gt; He died before his time &gt;&gt; because he was trying to gain the favor of a man that feared God. You can't you can't gain the favor of a man that fear God with sympathy. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; If you want that man's favor, fear God as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he came and and and told David, you know, and the battle was on and and you know, and Saul say I should kill him and I took the sword, I killed him and he just make up his own story, &gt;&gt; his own death sentence. And David asked him, "Who child are you?" Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He he he didn't even lie to say I of Benjamin &gt;&gt; or of Judah. He said I'm I'm an Ammonite. David said before my eyes b before I b my eyes, his hair should go off. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh and and and the same cowardness was shown of of one of the servant of David. He did the same thing. He went and killed one of Saul's son and then came running to David bringing the head and and and and David had to kill him again. All of those things are cowardness. They are all cowardness. You die before your time when you are a coward. I love that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We want to talk about cowardness. You see when you talk about calness another thing that you talk about is courage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The contr the the the contrary to be a cow is to be courageous is to be brave. So we we we want to expose cowardness tonight. We want to bully cowardness tonight. We want to rebuke cowardness tonight. And we want to say to the church be of a good chill. Amen. He said, "Because I have overcome the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we see here that Abnner was uh uh uh uh Saul captain. Let's let's go back to 2 Samuel chapter 3. 2 Samuel chapter 3. 2 Samuel chapter 3. Just look at verse one. And the Bible says, "Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David walked stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul walks weaker and weaker." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, so the house, so these two men, Abna and and Joah, you know, they were the men in the front of the battle. They were the men that were giving, you know, command. and they they they were the one that was instructing the battle. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, so we see here that after Saul died, uh, Abna was was was the chief in command. So, he had one of Saul's son to be the king. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He had one of Saul's son to be the king. Now you see that is that is the place of the captain the commander of the army. He can either put one of the son of the king into power or he put himself into power. &gt;&gt; That was just how those men were trusted. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was that was just how they were trusted. They were they they had they had they had so much command under their belt. Praise the Lord. So we see here that uh uh after Saul and Jonathan died uh Abnner knew Abna knew if you read you were here he he even told the son of Saul he says he says if I can turn the kingdom over to David because you know there was a prophecy there was a prophecy after David killed Goliath we all knew &gt;&gt; that this is the next king. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "We all knew that this man was the next king because if he never rose to the challenge to kill uh Goliath, we all would be under the Philistines. So we know &gt;&gt; we were just we were just applying our loyalty to your father." So he came to meet David and he told David, you know what? I'm ready to turn the kingdom over to you. If you're ready to work with me, I'm ready to turn the kingdom over to you because all the heart of Israel is after you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But just before that, just before that h they came, he and Jo, they were on both sides and uh they they came to a field and it says, "Let the young men play." My goodness, I don't know what kind of a play is that they put the young soldiers in the ring, they took their sword, you know, and they play with it, chop one another head, punch one another in the stomach. What kind of a play is that? and uh and and the young men they killed themselves right in the field. They were trying their strength, the strength of war. And then right after that, the brother of uh of uh uh of of Abna Asahel, he ran after he ran after the the brother of Joab. Sorry, the brother of Joab asel. He ran after Abnner and he started chasing Abna. And when he looked behind, he saw him. He says, he said, "Young man, you turn around. Stop. Stop making me to go out of breath. Stop. Stop what you are doing. You see, because these men that were captains, they were not Je choosing captain just because of favoritism. &gt;&gt; They were men that were brave. &gt;&gt; They were men that knew how to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We would call them gorilla fighters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Little boy, stop what you were doing. I I don't want I don't want uh and and and and and Abisha was still running after him and this old man is losing his birth stop what you are doing and you know and he felt threatening and he killed him but that was the younger brother of Joab. So a kind of a role a a it brought rage in the heart of Joab also he wanted to revenge but why he was away now has come and talked to David and David says well you go and do whatever you want to do if you turn the people over I will become the king of all Israel praise the Lord &gt;&gt; and then on his way he met Joab and the people told Joab oh yeah Abda was here, you know, and uh and uh uh uh uh and he and he and David how to talk. So, I'm not talking personally why the king never arrested this man. This man uh fought against us. This man was seeking your life and then moreover, this is the man that killed my brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see that that uh that honor that God gave David was an everlasting honor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whose heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That was just that was just David. Yeah. I mean, if if if he's going to save the people, if they are going to surround us, that's that's okay. Amen. If I did not kill Saul uh h and I had the opportunity told I did not rejoice at his death, why will I rejoice at the death of Abna? &gt;&gt; He was a man after God's own heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; A man that revealed the heart of God. &gt;&gt; A man whose heart was moved. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So the the the Bible would tell us there now and then and Joab heard that he ran after Abna. He called Abna you know as a friend to Abna. Now now he has just talked to David and everything is okay. So if David captain is calling him he's not going to fight because he have already settled thing with David. &gt;&gt; According to him I'm going to turn the kingdom over to David. We all Israel going to be one. It's not going to be Israel and Judah. We are all going to be one and we will all serve. I I will even get in the army. I can self honor Joab. So when Joab called him, he felt like the new commander is calling in. Let me surround myself. And when he came, he never even defended himself. That's what that's what David was lamenting. Your hands were not tied. &gt;&gt; Your feet were not in feathers. They never put it in chains. You mean you couldn't fight? &gt;&gt; You couldn't even give a fight. &gt;&gt; You couldn't give a fight. That's what we are talking about tonight. You mean you just you will just surrender to whatever you are dealing with. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; After you know that it is not for your good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. After you know that it is it's not the Holy Ghost that is working in your body. It's not the Holy Ghost that is working in your mind. It's not the Holy Ghost that is giving you that desire. You will just surrender. &gt;&gt; Your hands are not tied. You can't lift your hands and praise God. &gt;&gt; Your feet are not bound. You can't stand up and jump and say praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You will just sit there and the devil will just keep doozing you on your head, &gt;&gt; slapping you in the face &gt;&gt; as if you don't have a living God. &gt;&gt; You don't have a book full of promises. &gt;&gt; There is not one promise you can find in this book. &gt;&gt; And show it to the devil. &gt;&gt; And you will die like a fool. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; David cried. He wept. &gt;&gt; I mean, David could say, "If there was one man that gave me hard time in battle was Adna." He knew how to fight because the Benjamins, they were left-handed. And there were people that were good in bow and arrow. According to the scripture, they were left-handed and they were very good in shooting bow and arrow. They knew how to fight. So when David think about how how easy it was not even war. We were not fighting war to say Joab and I'm that troop were fighting against one another. It was not war. You just stand there like a statue. Oh abna. Why you die like a fool? You die like a coward. You die like a man that have never been in battle. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you come from one battle, it must encourage you to be able to fight the next battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because we know that we we are not in a picnic. &gt;&gt; We are on a battlefield. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't look for a come after you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same way Jesus said this son shall follow you, the devil said this trouble will follow you also. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It depends on which one you embrace. &gt;&gt; The devil swear that these troubles will follow you, these affections will follow you, these sicknesses will follow you. Praise the Lord. But you can give him a border. &gt;&gt; You can raise a war &gt;&gt; and say when the enemy come as a flaw, the Lord will raise up a standard. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will hide myself behind that standard. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I know we all will die. &gt;&gt; But I will not die without a fight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I will not die without a fight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you come and see my dear body, my teeth is together like this, you must realize that this guy fought. &gt;&gt; You must say he fought. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you tell those undertaker to leave my teeth like that. Let everybody know I'm a fighter. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Am I scaring you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Okay. Cuz uh please uh I'm serious tonight. Amen. I'm serious tonight because you see uh brother Brandham said this in the in the message flashing red light. Uh you know he talked about the the ugliness of the age and he said this he says well it's such uh conglomerations of rottiness until it it produce a bunch of soft lazy no good hellbound generation. We have a generation that don't know how to fight. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a generation that don't know how to fight. I was looking at a little clip of a of a slave mother that was talking and says in those days when when we got a cut, he she said it if it was a bar cut on the hand and we did not have treatment. And she says what we what we do is that we go in the bound and we look for the the the uh uh uh the spider web. She said we look for she said we look for the spider web and and we take those web of the spatter and we spray it in the c. See a person will be will will be bleeding we will we will clean the c and we we take the spider web and we spray it in the c. She says that web ser like a stitching. &gt;&gt; Says she said medical science today will look at us and think that we are foolish. &gt;&gt; She said but we improvise with what we had. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That was a generation that knew how to fight. &gt;&gt; They just don't cry, oh my soul, I'm bleeding. They do something about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; They just don't cry. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Oh my soul, oh my my my my father, oh my house, oh my family, all my No, they do something about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. living in such a hu a lazy generation people just gave up so easily sometime gave up for nothing &gt;&gt; for nothing they just gave up they just throw in the tow I can't do this again you can't do it who will do it who should do it praise the lord And I believe when you read the book of of of Ecclesiastics, I believe that's that's the kind of a person that uh that that that Solomon was talking about, the fool, the wicked. Praise the Lord. Because you see brother Brandham say in the message expression he says many times it have been said that a person died prematurely or something uh uh uh that maybe some sin the date they did uh they did something wrong. He says that isn't a case to a Christian. Praise the Lord. He says it's not a case to a Christian to say that they die before their time. know it's not a case to a believer. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because I believe that a believer with all the promises that is in this book must not die like a coward. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have something to fight for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is something to fight for. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you don't have one, look for one because it's there. &gt;&gt; It's right there. is staring right in your eyes. You are behaving as if you are not saying it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are complaining about it &gt;&gt; when you need to be fighting. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You need to be You need to be fighting. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where are the fighters? You know where are the fighters? Oh my. Oh my. We know that um this is this is a old statement. You know uh a cow died many times before their death is a old statement. Actually it came out of a Shakespeare play. You know Julius Caesar was the one that made that statement. But it it kind of was stow out. It stole out most of the time when people, you know, when people complain, when people make excuses for things that they can deal with, things they can do. &gt;&gt; They come up with just flucent excuses. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh they just they just they want they just want to pull it on God, you know. Uh uh well it's the word of God. Uh uh some sometimes it's not. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because if you take the promise of God and you and and and you approach that thing, God can change it around. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He always speak to those who are fearful and avoid challenge experiences uh the anxieties and emotional pain of potential failure or harm repeatedly. Why those who are brave face difficult situation and they go right on. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They go they face difficult situation but yet they keep their heads high up. They have a song. They have a smile on their face. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have a smile on their face and they praising God. They are thanking God for for for for his goodness. And you find you find people like that all through the scripture. Look at the husband of Abigail. Amen. The Bible says the man by by by name is even called a fool. His name is means a fool. It just don't means that he's foolish. It means that he's a cow. Praise the Lord. See, this man was he was so blessed. He was he was he was in the wealth of his farm, his sheep, and everything there. And you know what the story is? The Bible says and David and his men you know that they make their tent by by by you know by by his farm and never even never even harm anything. But because of their presence the Philistines could not come and invade his farm. Praise the Lord. Just because they knew that David and his men were in that area. So I mean they were not even paying this man even though David was running away from Saul but yet the Philistines knew the name David. Praise the Lord. All the armies around when they hear David they knew that that was Israel army. They were not even thinking about Saul and Abna and their army. They all they have to hear David and his men. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when one of the worker went and told Abigail, she came there and uh uh uh you know, she knelt down and said, "Oh, oh my lord, David, I never knew that you and your men were here. If we knew we were going to feed you dearly, we were going to, you know, supply everything that you need. Oh, I mean such a way that she she I mean she just uh make a plea to David and she went back and told her husband. Praise the Lord. And what did he said? Oh, David just running away from Saul. [Music] Those are the kind of people they don't work. They want for people to jet feed him. He was supposed to be working with sword and he running away all over the place and hiding on people farm. I should come and give mine uh uh my my ghost to him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see his his uh his wealth has entered his head. the few sheeps and few farms that he had, it has entered his head and he he's he's now watching his mouth. Drink some wine and is all in his eyes is I mean his stomach has got so big that is leading him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he just open his mouth and just talk to people anyhow to him now he has arrived. He's one of the rich man in Israel. &gt;&gt; He can count all the things he have done by his hands. &gt;&gt; That's what Solomon said in in Ecclesiastic. He said it's it's vanity. It's the way of a food. It's a way of a cow. &gt;&gt; And what will happen is that you will labor and other men will come and enjoy your labor. &gt;&gt; Because wisdom is not applied to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those are some of the things that Solomon is dealing with in the book of Ecclesiastic when he say vanity, vanity. These things I have seen under the sun. How men has labored and labored and labored and labor because it's cowardness. Most of they are the men they are men that are trusting in uh in in their muscles. They are trusting in their ability. They are making name for themselves and not making the lost name. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let God give you a name. &gt;&gt; Don't look for one. &gt;&gt; Because he's a name giver. &gt;&gt; He told David, I will give you a name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He did not change David name but he gave him a name. &gt;&gt; He magnified his name. &gt;&gt; He associated with David's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He was a cow. The Bible says that very night that he opened his mouth against the anointed of the Lord, the death angel came and pack him home. The Bible says David said, "Thank you, Lord. You saved my hands from blood &gt;&gt; because I will have killed him for his foolishness and I will always remember that I killed him." But let his own foolishness kill him. Let he die before his time because that's cowardness. Praise the Lord. When people are so so in their in in in their arrogancy is cowardness. &gt;&gt; When we when we believe in our proud and we believe in our in in in what we it's cowardness &gt;&gt; because when God take your birth one thing it will just be zero. No matter your muscle mass, no matter your weight, &gt;&gt; if that breath of life leaves you, you hit this ground and you gone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's cowardness. If you if you know the story of Aito also a man the Bible say this man was so wise. He has such a gift. He will give he will set you down and give you advice and it will come to pass just like he said it. When David is going to war David will call him into the cabinet. When everybody talk he will says what did you what you think are he talking? He will say, "No, David, let now the man go this way." I advise let them go this way because early in the morning, the enemy will come and just like that it will happen. That's just such a gift that he had. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But when he when he went, he joined himself to Abselon, David's son, when David was kicked off the throne. And now Abselon called him into meeting because Abselon knew that this man you knowh he was a blessing to his father. So he called him into meeting and everybody talk and I talk and advised them and says you know your father Abselon he's a man of war. He's not going to be down there. He's going to be this way. So let the army go this way. But David has David knew he knew that if I give a counsel they will grab him. So what he did, he sent another man into the camp. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; After a Toher gave his counsel, this man came and said, "Look, I I saw David and his men. They will not be down there. They will be here." He turned the council of Aito to around. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know that's why brother Brandham says to overcome, you must understand the tricks of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because we are in a warfare. You must understand the tricks of the enemy. You must understand your body. &gt;&gt; You must understand your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell your body just from eating. Why you behaving as if to say you have not eat this morning? &gt;&gt; All you want to do is just eating, eating, eating, eating. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You must speak to it sometimes. He turned the council of Aayito around and the battle went against Abselon. And when I heard it, he went and hang himself. That was a coward because he felt like I have never failed before. &gt;&gt; I have never given a counsel and he has ever failed. If you are a human, you will always fail. You were born a failure and if God don't help you, you die a failure. &gt;&gt; When we fail, we must be humble and come back to the Lord and say, "Lord, be merciful to me. I make this choice. It was wrong. &gt;&gt; We must get a repented heart. &gt;&gt; You can't hold yourself before God and be justified." &gt;&gt; Lord, I never make mistake before. You You deceive me. Lord, Lord, you you Who are you? &gt;&gt; Come on now. just a vapor and you are gone. &gt;&gt; We will not even remember you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because the only thing we remember is the things that people do for the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the thing that live after them. &gt;&gt; It's not your names. &gt;&gt; It's not your height, your weight. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He died like a cow. He should have waited and said, "What went wrong? What went wrong?" He should have asked the man, "Did you people follow my counsel?" He never waited for that. He just went and hank himself. He went and he hang himself. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There was a whole lot to that though. There's a whole lot to that. I don't want to go into that because if you sell it the background that man ah was related to Urias. &gt;&gt; So his council of killing David was like a revenge for Urias. &gt;&gt; But let's get into our subject tonight. Just trying to give you example of men that die before their time. Not really in a sense that they die before their time, but they die like a cow. And it's only a cow that die thousand times before he time before his time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because even before death reach you, the fear will kill you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "She that liveth in pleasure is there while she live." That's that's a life of coward. &gt;&gt; That's cowardness. Any life without God in it is cowardness. It don't have a value. Praise the Lord. It don't have a good expiring date. It will expire at any time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; See what brother Bon says here. God's covenant with Abraham. He says uh he took the father word and defeated Satan right on his own ground. That Matthew chapter 4 Jesus in on on the mountain of temptation he defeated the devil on his own ground. He said yeah uh uh what did he do? He he was proving to the weakest of Christian that you can defeat Satan any word any time &gt;&gt; on the plain word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for some kind of a crafty thing to say. You don't have to pick up some kind of a Pentecostal, you know, h slogan. You can just I am the Lord that healeth all your diseases. Just the plain word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to make it to sound like you're so spiritual. Just the plain word of God. &gt;&gt; You see, and that's the reason why when we learn to memorize scripture, it help us sometime because it's just the plain word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes when we paraphrasing it, we start to say some things that the Bible never say &gt;&gt; and you say the Bible said. Don't make God alive. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He was proving that the weakest of Christian, no matter what state you are in no matter how how weak you are, you can still fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not have a strength to throw a hand. &gt;&gt; You might not have a strength to sing a song, &gt;&gt; but you can reverse back to a promise in this book. &gt;&gt; You can rehearse it in your heart. &gt;&gt; When there is no strength to say Jesus, &gt;&gt; you can say it in your stomach. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can say it in your mind. It will say have the same strength. &gt;&gt; You can keep saying Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. It will have the same strength as somebody that is saying Jesus from on top of the hill. &gt;&gt; Amen. The weakest of Christians can defeat Satan any time on the plain word of God. Just take it and says, "Thus say the Lord, it is written." &gt;&gt; Says, "Satan, it is written, greater is he that is in me &gt;&gt; than he that is in the word." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Satan is written that he is the alpha and omega. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan is writing that the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to cook it with anything. &gt;&gt; Don't even season it. &gt;&gt; Just take it raw. &gt;&gt; Praise. Let's let some blood be in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime we roast it and we roast all the blood out. Okay, let's let's go ahead here now. Uh, thou said the Lord, it is written. He says, "Thou takes all the cowness out of the church." It takes all the cowness out of the church. It takes the washbone out and put a backbone in there. &gt;&gt; People say now what what are you wishing about? No witching. God promised it and so and it's so. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like our brother said something on Sunday and I repeated that. Amen. I know you know sometimes when you have in a preacher preaching preaching with a translator if if the if the if the church is not used to that sometime you just only enjoy the language it's hard to follow the preaching you enjoy this person say this you know it become like a like a drama you know you just you just be looking at this brother going this way then you look at this other brother going this way sometime you get lost in that and uh but you see that like like he said on Sunday you If if a promise is given to you &gt;&gt; and you believe the one that have promised &gt;&gt; it create an expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Especially when the person say I'm coming. &gt;&gt; I I I will come and you don't know the time. It even make you nervous. Praise the Lord. It make you nervous because you wake up right in the morning. It comes to your mind. Oh, he said he's coming and and you go, you start cleaning the house. you go, you start uh buying food and uh finally you look through the window, you look at your phone, the he called you, you you I mean you you are under expectation because you have a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and that promise starts to condition you. &gt;&gt; It condition your entire day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, uh uh please let me know when you are coming." And you look at your phone, no respond. He's not even responding. I don't even know if he's on his way. Maybe he's driving. I don't know. Maybe he's in the traffic. It condition you. It put you in a place. So, so that's what brother Brandham is saying. He says God has given us a promise. So, we don't need to be wishing. &gt;&gt; I wish it happened. &gt;&gt; I wish I was this. No, you don't need it because you have a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can get a good meal beside a sandwich. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "You don't need to be wishing this." And uh he says, "Uh God promised it and and sold." He says, "Uh we we we get a meeting staring like that and we could have a healing service get started. When you get to some of that, when you take that, oh wish, I wish I could." No wishing or nothing about it. God gave the promise and that settle it. When God says anything is wrote in heaven and that makes it good forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That makes it good forever. You see where where God put the fear for those that are fearing quick to be afraid. we get into a panic or our faith is is quick to be out of the window. This little crisis come in hand. Our faith goes out of the window. And let me tell you, let me tell you something. When you are uh the the thing that gives you the the the character to behave, the things that puts you under control, it gives you the right behavior, the right attitude is is the promise of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's when you are believing that God will do it. &gt;&gt; When your faith goes out of the window, your attitude will change. &gt;&gt; You can become rude. You don't get control. You don't have respect. &gt;&gt; It's faith that gave you respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; When people lose faith, &gt;&gt; they become now they can say anything. They can blasphe without fear, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not without fear, &gt;&gt; but they are driven by fear. &gt;&gt; When you see people behaving like that, it's fear that is behind it. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes they just want for God to kill them so everything can end. &gt;&gt; But God don't work on your feelings. &gt;&gt; He will make you come from out of it. &gt;&gt; Count to yourself. get sober. &gt;&gt; Then he wait for you now to choose what to do. &gt;&gt; That's how people behave sometimes. They get so unruly. All they thinking in their mind now, you know, judgment will fall, fire will fall from God will just sit there and look at you. You you do all your misbehaving, do everything and then you get sober. Then it starts to rain down on you. What have I done? What did I use my mouth to say? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And even they will not come seeking God and crying to God. They wanted you to come and beg them. Brother, can sister, can you make your life right? Please can you tell God to to forgive you? Do you want us to beg you? Who was energizing you to say those things? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's fear. Many times it's fear. Fear is an unruly force. Faith can be governed &gt;&gt; because faith is governed by the word &gt;&gt; but fear is unruly. That's the reason why it can destabilize your mind. It destabilize your your everything you are doing because you are afraid. &gt;&gt; It can destabilize your health and that's cowardness. That's cowardness. I mean after after everything that you have gone through then you say I don't know what to do really you mean till your age at this time when you see the word in it in its condition and what is happening I don't know what to do is should that be your your your your language Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. [Music] Are you getting my thought tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's not what God want for his church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not that's not what he want for his church. Do you do you remember right there in the book of Kings, you know, this prophet came out and prophesied that tomorrow, he said, "Tomorrow God is going to bless." He said, "There is going to be a pouring of of of of food that that that flour will be sell so cheap. You will have so much." &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; There was one cow in the midst. He says, "Uh, he called himself Ben." He says, he says, uh, I don't see how this is going to happen. Amen. It's the same people that that says, I don't see, I don't see what is happening in this church. &gt;&gt; I don't see what is happening. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, he says, I don't see how this is going to happen. The prophet said, you will see it with your eyes. &gt;&gt; You will see it with your eyes. You will hear it by the hearing. You will see it with your eyes but you it will never touch your tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was a coward. &gt;&gt; You can you cannot defy doubt. Said the Lord. &gt;&gt; If God said he will get a church without spot wrinkle. I don't care whether you see it or not. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you see it. I don't care whether you believe it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen &gt;&gt; because you can't defy thou said the Lord. &gt;&gt; For you to defy thou said the Lord is to defy your existence because your very existence is the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; The very existence of this word God spoke it into existence. It was thou said the Lord that brought it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you know what God would do? There was farming in the land. Farming everywhere. God took some lepers that had courage. &gt;&gt; They said, "If we stay here, we will die. &gt;&gt; Let's just go in the town. Let them kill us." Lord, &gt;&gt; if we stay here, we will die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no food. Everybody crying. &gt;&gt; The people that used to come and bring us their leftovers, they are not coming because there is no food. They will stay here. We let's let's just go to the town. And as they start approaching the land of the Syrians, God make the Syrians to start hearing cheras are coming. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; They says, "Oh, Israel is coming. Let's pack and leave." Everybody started running to the village, running in the bush. The lepros came. They see &gt;&gt; somebody was doing barbecue. &gt;&gt; They left the barbecue and they run in the bush. &gt;&gt; They saw someone boiling beans on this side. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Somebody was making bread is is burning in the oven. He says, "You run down there. Cut that store off. I will take care of the barbecue. You You steal the beans. Let's Let's have some Let's have some jubilee. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Those lepers, they sat there, they eat. It was just so much food. They said, "Oh my God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we are almost dying here. &gt;&gt; Let's not be so greedy. &gt;&gt; Let's go down to the town. Even though they they don't like us lepros, we are despised. But let's stand on the mountain and shout and tell them there is food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you know when they said there is food, you know who started running? Ben Heidi. He was the first one. He jumped to the gate and started running. Started running. The Bible says and he stormed his legs and fell and the people walked over him &gt;&gt; because that doubt said the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cowards do not enjoy the blessing. &gt;&gt; Brave and courageous people. &gt;&gt; They are the one that see the word of God coming to pass. They are the one that enjoy the blessing. &gt;&gt; That's not people that just fold up. Every little thing they fold up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not ready to fight. Give us chance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because some of us, we been in this thing. Amen. From the day of our birth, we were born into fighting. We will die fighting. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the scripture said it rain over him until the stomach that you supposed to keep food in outside. &gt;&gt; That's what happened to cows. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They only want to identify when there is a blessing. There becomes the mixed multitude. They can only mix. They know how to unmix themsel and mix themselves in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What am I doing tonight? I'm trying to encourage you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That don't tell you leave from here, you fight every day. &gt;&gt; A Christian life is a life of fighting every &gt;&gt; day. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't find anything to fight about today, I don't know how you live your day today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because uh because every day there is just some kind of a demon that is assign your way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he has to make your serial call, he will make it cold. &gt;&gt; And then just to make you mad. &gt;&gt; Let's read this. Brother Bam says here take take on the whole armor of God. He says the Christian church is is an army of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He said it's an army of God. We are soldiers. Soldiers of the cross and it is the business of every nation to see that their soldiers has the best there is. Praise the Lord. He says, "I was preaching the other night about achievement uh at another meeting somewhere. I talked about the American soldier." He says, "Uh uh uh when Washington was at Valley Fort uh about half of them had shoes on, which mean the rest of them, they were barefooted, but they had a general that prayed all night. He swept across the Delaware the next day. That's why we got America. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there were men that knew how to fight. They were men that knew how to fight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what God has raised us up for this for this hour is to fight. &gt;&gt; Because we cannot be overcomer without a fight. &gt;&gt; You cannot overcome without a fight. Sometimes you got to fight your own ideas. &gt;&gt; You got to fight your own thoughts, your own desires. You got to fight it. That's what Jesus did. Not my will, but your will, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let it be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can how can the people be there? You you sitting down there and and and and the promises of God don't excite you. Sure. &gt;&gt; They are reading the promises of God to you &gt;&gt; and you are not excited. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not excited that God's that God has given you precious promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says he will have a church without spot a wrinkle. It does not excite you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we are if if if we get into the fight, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every promise becomes an armor to the church. &gt;&gt; And that's what excite fighters. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what excite fighters. &gt;&gt; When when when the Americans send an ammunation to to the Ukrainian, they are excited. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They know that if they die, they are dying for their freedom. &gt;&gt; So every time a promise of God is given to the church, it must excite the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the the the the Lord says this in his word. The apostle Paul said, Peter said, John said, brother Brandham said, it must excite us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't just sit there and expect that, you know, you know, go God has already given his word. &gt;&gt; It's for us to take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must be able to take it. Take the book and eat it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's take the book and eat it. &gt;&gt; We're not a denomination church where I mean the preacher must come and be begging you to say amen. Let a church say amen. Let a church say amen. just to get you excited. &gt;&gt; The word must get you excited. &gt;&gt; Jesus said h you know h don't rejoice because uh uh you get healing and miracle. He said rejoice because your name is in the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is something when the word comes rejoicing the among the people, &gt;&gt; the people that are enjoying the promises, they are happy. They are ready. But it it looks like the people are just ready to show up to church and they're ready to go back home. &gt;&gt; It looks like our attitude sometimes just show like, "Hey, my friend, shut up and let's go home." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When we supposed to make the best of the few minutes we come and spend together, we we we made the best. You know, sometimes it's like that. You know, the people says, "Well, we guess who excited." You know, the preacher preach long. It looks like when we get excited, the guy preach long. He don't they don't stop so easy, you know. But brother Bam says it's just like a hunting dog. That's all you're doing. &gt;&gt; Because what we doing, we're chasing spirits. &gt;&gt; And that's what we're trying to do tonight. We are coming against cowardness. &gt;&gt; We are coming against a spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; We are coming against a spirit that makes people to just fold their hands. The spirit that makes you sorrowful. &gt;&gt; As if to say your God is dead. &gt;&gt; That's why we are coming again. We're coming against that spirit tonight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because it's the spirit that want to kill you before your time. It want to kill your zeal. &gt;&gt; It want to kill your knowledge for the Lord, &gt;&gt; your love for God. They want to kill it. &gt;&gt; The devil don't mind if you come and sit in church and sleep. He don't mind. That's the kind of a person he want in church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "That's why we got America because they were brave men. Men that never had no shoes on their feet, but they were ready to get through the rivers. To bring freedom, to bring liberty. They were able to raise something. What are we risking?" Amen. You see that's that's that's that's the loudish age. It's the age of convenience, &gt;&gt; the age of plenty, the age of laziness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's that's our age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it can creep on you so easy. &gt;&gt; You don't realize I mean uh you you just there. You I mean you are just there. You are just there. A whole day can go and you ask yourself what did I do today? Tell yourself. Amen. That's the age we are living in. He says he says that's how we got America is mening men who has something to fight for. We should never let that down. Why should we why we should never let down? We have something to fight for. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have a loved one to fight for. We have a relative to fight for. &gt;&gt; We have a child to fight for. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a community to fight for. &gt;&gt; There is something to fight for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when when that thing register to you, you will have a prayer chamber. &gt;&gt; Because you will always want to go to that place because you know there is something to fight for. &gt;&gt; Amen. We must be bringing prayer requests of our relative, prayer requests of a coworker, prayer request of somebody. I saw the girl at Walmart today. She was looking so distressed. I want let's take a prayer for. We don't need to know her name. We don't need to know where she's living. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But because you have something to fight for. &gt;&gt; That's the thing that make Christian life sweet. It gives you something to fight for. It does not have to be me and myself. &gt;&gt; No, it does not have to be be because it is it is it is now you that that is more serious. &gt;&gt; Like I say, serving the Lord. Matthew chapter 5, we just went through it. Serving the Lord. How do we serve the Lord? How do we serve the Lord? It is not in keeping the commandments. It's not in living right. If you take yourself serving the Lord as that self-righteousness because it's just you and what you are doing. God do not have no corporate body. His body is the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in serving the Lord is what we do for the church. What we do for the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. what we do for humanity. That's how we serve God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't serve God in keeping his commandment. Oh, I read my Bible. I pray every day. I'm serving the Lord. You know, I'm a Christ. That that's how we think Christianity is. &gt;&gt; So, it is just me and myself. Do you have a desire for someone else to be saved? &gt;&gt; Who do you have a burden on your heart? Oh, I wish that God would do this for this person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I remember many years ago, 1993, uh uh uh uh back there when when we started uh uh uh you know, uh uh preaching, you know, we we were all just young boys in church and and uh it it used to bother me. I was so bad about it. I just thought I I said, "Lord, you can't tell me that in this in in this entire setting there is not a girl here that can be saved." I was just so burdened for us to have a sister in church. because it's just all brothers and you know young young guys everybody ego gets up then pretty soon we start disrespecting one another. How can we run a church without a family? I said Lord your church is a family. How can we run a church? None of us are married. How is this thing ever going to look like we are serious? &gt;&gt; I remember one day I was out there in the market and uh uh uh you know I was I was I was selling. We had this brother uh James Nimler. He used to uh uh make our product. We used to sell and I I used to go sell and the other brother was a teacher. We three was living together. The teacher was the song leader, the the the uh producer. He was uh the the asher and I was the preacher. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know, preachers are businessmen. So I was doing the selling. Praise the Lord. [Music] So I went out this mo that morning that I went in the market, you know, and and everything. I was there and and I and and and as I was walking that just that was just all that was in my heart. I was just praying and I saw this young lady walking before me. I said, "Oh God, there's a young lady that is walking. She could be a sister in church." You know, I just I just said that. I just I just pray that in my heart. And as soon I went past her. She said, "Oh, are you selling the car?" I said, "Yes." She says, "Oh, man. I I finished uh oh, I've I've used all my money, but can you go back with me?" So, she wanted for me to go back with her to the market. She was going to ask somebody to give her money so she can buy. and uh uh you know so we walk back and you know we started talking all the things she's talking you know I'm hearing her but I'm praying in my heart I'm just I'm saying Lord I don't know I just prayed and here says this young woman call me whatever is going to happen you know I you know I didn't I didn't I didn't bring no preaching to to her I was selling my copa I wanted to make sure she buyed you know and and then we w we went we went over but this is this is this This is going to be very strange though because uh we went over and uh and uh and the lady that she took me to later on I will leave that lady song to the Lord. And then uh uh you know and she she she met the woman and she told the woman oh I wanted to buy this but I use all my money. Can you give me money and I'll give it back to you? And you know she talked all of that. So she so uh he said yeah I really wanted to buy two you know and and all of that. So I just told her I says, "Well, let's do it like this. Where do you live? I can bring it to your house." She says, "Oh, really?" I wanted to know her house. Why? Because I was I was selling on Tuesday. Thursday were my witnessing day. I changed in Muffy Thursday. I'm in a suit. I'm in my clean cart. You would never know that this guy was the guy that was selling. So I I I told her, I said, "Sir, where do you live?" I can bring it to your house. She said, "Oh, really?" I said, "Yeah, I go bring it to your house." She said, "I don't want for somebody to buy." I said, "I can bring it to your house." She said, "Okay." Gave me the house number. Then she said, "Well, okay." Then just bring it to the house. She told the woman, "Thank you." You know, and she went home. Gave me the house number and everything. So, uh, I went about, you know, I I sold the ones that were in my hands. I went back home because we had some home and then and collected it. I ate, you know, talked with my friends, you know, and I I was just sharing the testimony with them. I said, "Wow, you know, there was it was very strange today, but you know, I'm I'm I'm going there." So, I went there, you know, long story short, I'm doing too much talking now tonight. Long story short, that will be the first couple I will lead to the Lord. That young lady and her husband will be the first couple and that will be the birth to the church in her bell. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was very awesome because I carried the car the cop I said when I turn when I when I show up Thursday, she never knew I was the one. &gt;&gt; Okay. She never knew I was the one. I mean, I put on my makeup. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I just want to cheer you up a little bit tonight. I dress. I put on my makeup, make sure my hair was good, everything, shave, everything. She never knew. And they never knew until I knew that I got them because I was not going to talk about coat. I came to talk about the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when they started coming to church and then one day then I asked them I said where you bought your copper from? He says, "Oh yeah, that one guy saw this hopper to us and you know she's talking about her dad." I told her I said I'm the guy that really &gt;&gt; But you see what I'm talking about is is that thing when soul become a burden on your heart, you go to bed talking about it, you praying about it, it's just on your heart. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. When it's just on your heart that Lord just give me one soul. Let me lead somebody to the kingdom. Let my life become a testimony. &gt;&gt; I don't want to die like a cow. That's what I'm talking about tonight. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if this word is truth, if this is truth and is good for you, it must not be only for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Christian life is not a selfish one. Brother Brandon says that's how we got America. Gilling men who had something to fight for. He says we should never let that down. Now they had h a musket in them days knives. He says some kind of a small knife that that was the best thing that they had. And today we look at it in a we we look at a different in our army today than than there was then. But you know being infinite uh infinite he cannot change there where my faith rest is on God's word because it is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now see what brother Brandon was says your testimony. He says now remember I'm I I am an American. He says generation after generation back to the third and fourth generation being an American. If this country ain't worth fighting for, it ain't worth living in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I I I you know, just studing on this tonight, I I I was just I was just looking into something that is worth fighting for. &gt;&gt; He says, if it's not worth fighting for, &gt;&gt; if you if we just only want to enjoy the benefit of America and and and and uh and we don't have nothing good to say about it, then we should not be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; That just that just a plain true story. &gt;&gt; The same thing will happen to your family. The same thing will happen to your home. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If your home is not worth fighting for, then you should not be in it. &gt;&gt; The same thing will happen to the church. If the church is not worth fighting for to keep it clean and holy, then we should not be here. Find another place to go. If it's not worth fighting for, it's not worth living in. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If the message is not worth fighting for, it's not worth believing. &gt;&gt; If you can't defend it, then how do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says, "Believe." Yeah. Uh uh that I'm able to do this. He said this is the greatest gener greatest greatest nation there is on the heaven. I'm glad to be an American. If it worth anything, it worth fighting for. It worth standing by. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. Amen. Because I mean you would you will not you will not you will not even enjoy the blessing. You will not even enjoy the blessing if if you just only want the blessing. You will not enjoy your time being here. &gt;&gt; Yes, you will not enjoy your time being here because you don't you don't count it to be home. It's not your country. You are just here because you are here. You will not enjoy your time being here because what you're doing is that your body is here. Your spirit is living somewhere else. &gt;&gt; You see what you're doing? &gt;&gt; You are you keep disconnecting yourself from your reality. This is your reality. If there is ever a time on earth you will serve God is now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If there was a record like the book of Acts to record us, &gt;&gt; if they will say anything about you of 2025, it's because you were in a church in Minneapolis. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're not going to write a record for you and say you were over in uh uh Airbis Church or you were in h one church somewhere else. Your record will be you were part of what took place in Minneapolis. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is our time. &gt;&gt; This is our own history we are writing. We are putting ourself back in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; If it was wrote of you, what will be said? &gt;&gt; If your name were in Acts chapter 6, Acts chapter 7, what will they say about you? No, I don't want to be a setting man. I don't want to be one of those guys that were called a setting man. Praise the Lord. I don't want to be a settlement man because you find out through the scripture sometimes is the troublemaker that I call settlement. Amen. Not all the time. But sometime even the woman with with the blood issue her name was never mentioned. She was called a certain woman. So it's not all the time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But even even even at that point, people thought that she was the troublemaker because when Jesus says, "Somebody touch me." &gt;&gt; Peter says, "Lord, no, don't don't even say that. Who is whoever is the one that touch you with all the people that are touching you? The person that touch you for you to say somebody touch me." you know, uh, she caught a stirred because she got Jesus attention. &gt;&gt; But what are we talking about? This is our time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it is not worth standing by, it's not worth supporting, it's not worth uh, presenting yourself, then just count yourself out &gt;&gt; because it's not going to be a blessing to you anyway. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's that's what has become some some of the national crisis that we have because I mean there there are people that just want the benefit of the US and but they just don't want to be part of the country. And you find that uh that same spirit creeping into the church. They want the blessing. They want they they want the blessing of uh of of of William Brandon. You find many people says William Brandham God you know because the Bible uh brother Brandham says uh you know he were told behind the curtain of time all those that love you. So for them they must only love brother Brandham &gt;&gt; because he was told all those that love you will be there. &gt;&gt; For them they must only love brother Brandon. Whether they obey God they obey the word they are breaking churches. They are living wrong &gt;&gt; but they say I love brother Brandon because the angel those that love you and them that you love will be there. &gt;&gt; That's a perversion. That's a deception. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is a deception. Go back and read the testimony. Go back and read it properly. Study it. Run it through the message and see what what uh what what what was told the prophet. &gt;&gt; So that's all they want to do. They come in church. They are never there. They are never there to be part. They just they just want they just want brother Brandon. That's all they prayed in. Brother Brandham, God, oh brother Brandham, God come, come and deliver me. &gt;&gt; Because they are thinking, they are creating a kind of a idol for themselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's cowardness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, then the God of Willing Brandham, he's the God tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's the god of sister now me sister Al's brother Hillary. He's the god of all of his children. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't give me your idol. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I won't be part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can bring me whatever you want to bring me. I will not be part of it. Praise the Lord. When God met me, you were not there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He met me and before he showed me his prophet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I met God before I know brother &gt;&gt; Brandon.
