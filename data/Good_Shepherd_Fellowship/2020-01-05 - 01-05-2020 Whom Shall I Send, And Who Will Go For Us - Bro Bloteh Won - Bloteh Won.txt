Otis would read us this evening during the convenience heavy so he would keep his greetings for this evening amen but it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen we will also welcome our Lord he's the most important guest in this in the service is the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord amen and we will bring few reports to you sister cousine is doing well her surgery went well and spoke spoke with the husband this morning and and she's recovering praise the Lord and we were down to see brother brother zekiel but Ben is not with us he's on an official duty so he hope to be in this evening and but Ezekiel he really taught you who have been here this morning to be able to say some few things from his heart to you people thanking you for your prayers but he will eat any more of your prayers and I thought he was going to be here so I really had a time to talk to him and actually if I could say some things on his behalf most especially around his health situation but he's doing okay we know our brother he's uh he's he's a fighter and we believe that the Lord is going to bring him true and everything that he's going through praise the Lord Amen so I believe that he and the family they are thinking to to travel to Texas just to be be around the parents did a little bit wider deal with the health situation that he's having so he asks that we pray for him for Scott in sister now me I stay away and supporting sister Esther in the passing of a father-in-law spoke with brother Lloyd yesterday he wanted me to bring his greetings to you praise the Lord Amy and so we just want to thank the Lord for all of the express the Lord and I know just coming to the end of the year has been a little bit of a struggle with few of the Saints being down in their health even myself I started feeling a little bit sick as well close in the year but I think it's a good sign amen praise the Lord I believe that you know the enemy is trying to discourage fight against us but we know that a lot is on our side amen if the Lord be with us who can be against us praise the Lord Amen this evening as we announce we will be having our communion service and the Lord's Supper as as a church and we normally approach that in the evening time because of scriptural partying that is laid in the in the Bible and Paul says that evening the Lord broke bread with his disciples so we will be having communion the first Sunday of the year we should have done that on the third first but we just you know wanted to approach it on this first Sunday and I will say this in light to death is that there are three ordinance that the Lord Jesus Christ left with his church we know that salvation is a free gift that is given and Jesus paid the price of our Redemption there is no work that you can really do for the Lord everything that we do for God is a life of appreciation we are just appreciating what he has already done because I call into his word he has done everything amen and the scripture says all his works was finished even from the foundation of the world so but yet he left his church three literal elements you know three literal elements and and it's not that he left it with us to be a work for us to do but he invited us to be part of it amen and he said to the disciples happy ie if you know these things and do them you know for watching he was watching Peter feed Peter say no you will now wash my feet he said well if I don't do it then you and I clean and and Peter said okay you can wash my feet wash my whole body he said no the fetus enough and then after he did it he washed all the disciples feet he says I'm your Lord and your master I washed your feet so I would want I'm doing this as an example for you to do it one on to another so we realize even from the Old Testament there were do or I to me in even in the Old Testament in the old Tabernacle whenever they were doing sacrifices they never God will require them to bring those total doors the total dogs were never cut in in in half the other animals the ships and God would divide them in half they always represent do what to me and what is this do or die to me the daughter to men is salvation and healing praise the Lord the two goes together he's the Lord they saved our soul and the God that hew our body praise the Lord this body does not need need to be safe because we are born we grow we get old and if Jesus Tyree we go to the grave praise the Lord but the body needs to be healed the body needs to be strong so healing is the children's bread healing is for the body the saving of the soul is the work that God does within the believer so you see in this in these three elements that he gives to the church they also speak of the door I to me it was beautiful when I when I came across there steadying this weekend you you remember in the Bible the scripture say there he died believe and is baptized shall be safe praise the Lord so we believe the Lord Jesus Christ by faith amen but our baptism identified us with his death burial and resurrection because that was what he did for our salvation praise the Lord so when we believe him and accept him by faith by his word he expect us to be identified with with his death burial and resurrection baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then the convenient also much as in John chapter 13 he says take this bread it is my body drink this wine is my blood and it is also a type of healing praise the Lord I was going to react or to you this morning from desperation but Benham says that he says the communion also represents healing praise the Lord amen he says it also represents healing now now he says this he says and now me you meditate remember Israel ate it in desperation and true the journey there wasn't a feeble one a morning in the end of 40 years this is divine healing also praise the Lord so the communion is divine healing in u.s. kept communion it's almost like you running away from your own healing now the church through the years taught it in a way that you have to be heal you have to be I mean you have to be you I mean you have to be identified with the body to partake of the body amen and the way we identify by is by water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord the Bible says we are watched by the water of the word that's what for watching represent it represent our outward sentence at the grace of God does in our life as we trust God and as we move daily praise the Lord now this is the first Sunday so I have to to go over these things a little bit with the church just to be able to encourage us I will tell you as the church trust the Lord and partake of these things this is the mystical body partaking of it we are identifying with God's Word and God come behind it in package world God come behind it and perform the things that he have promised to do praise the Lord amen that is the reason why we encourage ourself in these things and we also encourage you to be part of it praise the Lord you see it could be very strange if I choose to have a prayer line this morning and say I'm going to pray for your sickness most everybody would come in the line they will either come for a sec need or they would come for a need of someone but if we should set up the communion table in the evening everybody will stay home praise the Lord that's divine healing so we want to encourage you while we'll be back at 5:00 p.m. this evening and you welcome to to come in and be part of the services evening let's just stand on our feet and then we will just turn to the scripture a musicians I will have you have your seat maybe we do the end of the singing I mean the end of the Hoodoo singing at the end of the service praise the Lord Amen as I have chapter 6 as I chapter 6 as I chapter 6 let's just read from verse 1 in a year that can use your die I saw also the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above is stood the surfing each each heart each one had six wings with twin they covered their face and between the cover their feet and between the dead fly and one cry unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door move are the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I whoa is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the surfing on to me having a life cold in his hands which he have taken with the tongue from of the altar and he lay it upon my mouth and said lo this have touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taking the way and I seen his porch Amen all my desire that one of those angels would fly from from the presence of the Lord and touch me this morning I mean and I heard a voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for then say I yeah my sent me Heavenly Father we want to thank you law for another opportunity of coming into your house thank you Father for your blessings upon us Lord Lord this is the first Sunday of the year and as Christians we have come to identify ourselves with your resurrection that is the reason why the Sunday morning service we have embraced it over the year because it was on the first day of the week you came from the grave and Lord because you lay we can face tomorrow so we thank you we appreciate you dear father all of these loved ones who garden and our neighbor just across the street walking in here to visit with us our dear sister bill or loved ones our brother and in-laws traveling from Iowa come and spend the service with us Lord and father we just appreciate you Lord the Lord that you have placed in our heart for a god that we have not seen a God Lord God that we have only been taught about but there is just something in the hem of heart that know that there is an intelligence that is taking care of this word and we thank you Father but faith this morning we want to approach you and we want to speak to your people on your behalf we ask give us grace Lord gave us altar and so father that we will say those things of God that will be pleasing to you and father that will be edifying to your people something that will be said that we draw us closer to you especially father God as we approach this year that we don't know what a horse but we know you the whole time and eternity in your hands you promise in your word that you will never leave us you will never forsake us Lord so we come Lord this morning asking that father your grace we just bless us together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have a seat I want to use a liar question this morning as of as as mine as my message whom shall I send asking on God's behalf and who will go for us in a generation that we are living in an age that is being filled every day with atheism and Joshua believes and every day science is bringing out more evidence to be able to prove that there is no god but it was beautiful yesterday I was driving and I was listening to a science program on the testing of DNA and and and as they were testing the DNA's they test the DNA is from the proteins in the body so they were I mean it was it was a kind of a lab program but you know they were making it coming it was a radio program making coming on the different things that they were doing but there was something that kind of first struck me in the conversation as as their as as the tested DNA and the guy was saying how how fascinating it was to be able to see you know trace your identification back I meant to your father to your mother you know just from the proteins in your body in a different way they were bringing it out and the commutator says something that was very very profound when it came to the and and and the proven he said that he said in the Bible is said in the beginning was the word you know he made that comment in the beginning was the word he says actually that you have said in the beginning was the person and the person spoke the word Amen because when you trace a DNA you end up to a person you know so it was when he was taking the concept from if you trace a DNA you will end up to a person so he says I think is supposed to be in the beginning was a person and the person spoke the word I almost had a hallelujah faith in the car I said science is proving the Word of God because a word is a taught Express so if in the beginning was the word there was a thought behind our word and the top that was behind our word was the person that was behind the word praise the Lord Amen if you trace it you come up to a person praise the Lord Amen well as we are living in social society dinner as I said on the Terry first night I mean every other day you listen to baby C's and now you you even you all know from the news what is cooking in in the Middle East and I mean in Iraq and Iran and everything that is happening you know you know we are living in in trouble sometimes praise the Lord Amen just a couple of weeks ago there was another shooting in the church over in Texas because of a man that comes asking for help in UCC the acts were helping and got angry you know that the church did not help him enough and I mean there were just angry people all over the place that's the word that we are living in whoosh I'd go for us it's strange that God is asking this question the person that is asking this question is the Lord verse it says also i heard the voice of the law seen moon shall ascend and we shall go for us there is to pronounce day one girl speaking but to pronounce Almighty God speaking who shall ascend and we shall go for us the same God I said let us make man one girl speaking but he said let us make me he's the same one saying we shall go for us he never said when shall we sing he said Lucia asking are the Lord and we shall go for us praise the Lord Amen now we were we did we went through this just couple of months ago talking on the priority of God you see the the scallops they they read the Bible especially the in Genesis chapter 1 when the Bible says and then when God used that word in season and God said let us make man in our image there when when they study that from from from the original Hebrew God gromek and there there is a name of god that wishes elohim praise the lord amen and the expression that is me in that structure as shows a God there has many abilities that has many characteristics amen a God there has many attributes so the great colors being trouble to be able to be able to express or give the identification of the God now you have to know that this God that we serve he's not a man amen he's not a man he's the Creator of heaven and earth one time he fill our space and all time he fill everywhere he was the great internal spirit he'd word alone praise Lord God as a great intent of spirit to give him a son at that time is to give him a beginning because a son is the beginning praise the Lord so the scallops try to funnel wood to be able to express this girl to hold these great characteristics they say and God said let us make man in Genesis chapter 3 when man fell the Bible's use the same word again the Bible say and God said man has become one of us Genesis chapter 11 had a Tower of Babel when man was building a tower to reach the heaven God came down again and he expressed his great and great one dwelling with all his attributes characteristics in him and he says let us he's the same one speaking here well sure are sent in whoosh a goal for us oh I can spend the entire morning and the rest of this year's just speaking on there but I'll not want to take all of the time this morning I would just want to call our attention to say God is looking for a man God is looking for a woman in this dying generation that will be able to stand up for his name praise the Lord amen no matter what your denomination or belief what your to logic or belief all of those things can be conversation we can sit down we can talk about it but a subject before us this morning that God is looking for a person that will be able to stand in this godless society a man or a woman that will be able to stand for righteousness now will be able to stand for truth and a man or a woman that will be able to stay and say I know that there is a God in heaven where there were such a drug was I better go that would say even if you don't deliver us we will not bow down that's what we want to talk about this morning amen Oh sometimes it looks easy you know ever we come all together like this and we identified our set as Christians in a church and and we can sing it and that to the music you know anything and we listen to the word and and and and and and you know and somebody say Amen it sounds reasonable and another person say Amen and we can just float into death our scripture here is setting out a scene of a young prophet outlier they had a good friend you see of the king they grew up together one became a king one was a prophet praise the Lord and being the King you know they move together I mean the King come and see the Prophet for advice you know in all of the Haran and and he's the man of the land and I mean he's he's the fan of silver of voice to the people the final savor I tore it it to the people that was the king amen the Prophet is the final spiritual voice to the people are we together praise the Lord when it came to the place work as higher influence was taking away the one that was making him to 200 words that I don't know his nature whether he was never so what when he was but for some reason he was leaning to use ear the King because that was his friend they were working together and and and and I mean they had good friendship good relationship but when you see a left the scene as I needed another influence if we will be able to stand for God in his generation if you just go back to Isaiah chapter 5 and we a little baby will you will learn that's where the Bible says woe unto them that call good evil and call evil good you go back there you will read the Bible says right there in Isaiah chapter 5 woe unto them that bill house upon house which of course is what we do in our society or the sky strip or one apartment over another department so you can see that it was in such such a time with such a society and such a civilization but here God was looking for a man that would be able to stand for him no matter how the society advanced no matter how science were advanced in cell phones and cars and and different thing in knowledge will increase God is looking for the man that will be able to stand by biblical principle praise the Lord o men and women that will respect the marriage vows they know what it is that it's a secret Institute that God himself has established our society is missing the value of family prays alone many young women just want to have children and look for somebody to poor child support on it becomes a way of income praise the Lord what many men want to go judge they just want to go down through the neighbor who every apartment is sleep with anything to have skirt or dress on we are those morals value young children are growing with no courtesy no respect preparing for another ones God is looking for the man who shot our same I'm sure our sin and we shall go for us praise the Lord glory be to God churches is becoming the faster growing business because as long as we can we can follow the church with good instruments we can put the musicians on salary and bring committees in a leaner comedians into the church and just entertain the people just get a hold of them for 10 minutes because we are living in such a busy fast growing fast growing our our our age our our age we are living in it's a drive true age church now is just like a drive true praise the Lord you just come in and just go out praise the Lord or by sorry this morning I would keep you here a little bit until an angel can come from the presence of the Lord with a fire in his head and touch our live once again that's what we want praise the Lord that's the society that we are living in into churches I mean people just make mockery out of churches they horrible things about church speaking the name of the Lord in vain oh I'm becoming an evangelist this morning just bear with me a little bit amen you shall go for us Holmes I seen where is the young man that can be able to live like a just man what is the young woman that will be able to preserve herself and see some you know I'll keep myself to the glory of God until God give me a house my face oh Lord I mean just I mean just horrible things you hear in the news horrible things the aged man has been loosed out like beasts praise the Lord so consumed by evil evil passion and evil desire even children that can build their babies they will not mind but abuse them because they are possessed of an evil spirit who shall go for us where is the home that is going to come back to a biblical principle what the Bible would be on the table we will remind ourself of the commandment of God we will read a scripture and we will seek the face of the law or is the home in this society the society the word that we are living in people think is money that keeps family together I am Telling You there are some people that are richer than you they have gone through many divorce and preparing for the next one amen some things is how you work that's what will make you successful but except the Lord build the house the man they labor he labor in vain and a scepter Lord wash over the city praise the Lord and if the law wash over the city he would keep the house safe that's the God we sell we shall go for us as we are hit in 2020 we already in it amen few years ago and all the planes in you know in vision they were all saying in the year 2020 sometimes it's not because they really had a plane but many of the time the truck we will not we will not get there so if we can put the vision fire maybe we might not get them all as we are getting closer we can be able to develop and become better but here we are 2020 and in order projector vision will be another decade 2030 praise the Lord and the Jesus child will be telling you Happy New Year again 2030 is here the year change the mom the decade change but man is making no effort to change his ways man is making no effort to come closer to the God of heaven and earth and just like we told you the other night this world does not have an end people it does not have an end events were happy things were happy praise the Lord things were happy and the ages will roll back but one of these days time will be swallowed up into eternity praise the Lord and the wicked will cease to exist according to Malachi 4 the ranchers would come and walk on the ashes of the wicked praise the Lord whom shall go for us we're trying to give you a little picture to see the timeline Jesus spoke in the gospel that this gospel would go to the four corners of the earth before his coming and we have witnessed it praise the Lord I have an app on my phone that has the Bible in in almost every language on the heaven almost every language on the heaven praise the Lord and I say blessed be that person I invested their time to be able to work on their almost every language on the heaven Jesus said in Matthew chapter 24 because iniquity shall abound the love of God will go coal in the hearts of men because they increase of wickedness we increase in gold very cool and we were just trying to look at that little introvert just like it was in the days of Noah it was a period of time were seven days interpret I was giving to their age and nobody could go into the ark and nobody could come out of the ark praise the Lord and the Bible says you know and Lord had it that way until finally the law closed that I can seal Noah and those that were in the act we are living in such a time were we believe from scriptures and the things that are happening that grace is about returning to the Jews we have to know that Jesus said that as the likely goes from the east to the where so the coming of the Lord will be amen the gospel is going back to the Jews pretty soon God will be able to do bring a redemptive work and bring a woman around for four thousand out of there or for we Gentiles Jen tied days a beginning to close look at church life it's not like what it used to be it's just all about formality and faction it looks like we come to church in the church word it's just all about tradition people come to you know sure what they have instead of coming to seek the God of heaven in earth we should go for us just talking with some brothers and we were talking about because the church have experienced prayers that have not been answered people has prayed and pray ask God for things you tell me if we were getting down on our knees and seeking the face of God and God answer your prayer the next time you have a trouble that's where you are going praise the Lord but while we don't pray because we just feel that well you know pain is just a religion things that we recite that's why that you know they will write you prayer for you to read and this dead and when prayer is supposed to be a man putting out his heart to God trust in God now asking God and looking for solution that's why we have made prayer to me God please help me because I'm planning to do this you already have your plans and because of unanswered prayers it has killed a fervent desire for people to seek God to believe that there is a Living God a God that can answer prayers all of those things have taken fasting and praying away from from from the house of God and from the life of Chris things fresh law who shall vote for us if the church will remain the Church of Jesus Christ we should go for us praise the Lord amen oh we want the back of us back in our may say me we're seeing talked twice before he went to church because he will he will be caught out those early Christians were people than they believed you just think about what happened after Jesus left they had to believe that he was a living God and living among his people the Bible says they went from house to house breaking bread every service every evening service was a communion for them why because they wanted a reality of God India miss they wanted to feel the presence of the God I said I will never leave you I will never forsake you praise the Lord I want us to think about this this morning before we close this service let's think about it this morning with all our different resolution that we might have made for this year we shall go for us and whom shall I sing praise the Lord there's some things I was read to you this morning and just trying to keep it in this evangelistic away this morning but you realize as I chapter one the scripture says and I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up in his tree fill the tempura what was that train his train filled the temple and you know how to train moves the Train one bucket is connected to another bucket and it's connected to another bucket and it's connected to another bucket so that the train that filled the temple was was the surfing's of the angels their wings tipping to one another and it were moving so fast now watch what Isaiah said here he said I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne high and lifted up amen so right over there there was a moving of the angels I mean moving so fast so fast praise the Lord now and we and we were realized that if you take this back you will see there you go over to the Book of Ezekiel you will see the same thing that Ezekiel saw the angels those Charming's in in the temple before the throne of God praise the law and then with what Ezekiel identified as as the child being one having the face of a man and another one the face upon the ego and all of these different faces their heart you will realize the very first time that a Bible spoke about a cherubim was in the Garden of Eden when man brought the Word of God when he's seen it against God the Bible says and the Lord put cherry beans in there in the Garden of Eden to keep the Tree of Life so that that has been the protection to the church that's the reason why dearly in the scientist ed he give his angels charge over us right from the Garden of Eden they are always supernatural angels around the people of God the work of salvation is not a work of men's hands when God promised to keep us and protect us it's now what we can do if he keep if he promise to keep us healthy it's now our health insurance praise the Lord because right from Eden since man fell from God he promised whenever he comes back to the tree of life there will be angels and come about him praise the Lord amen so the church has traveled this way amen on the full side Ezekiel in the Book of Ezekiel he brought it out more more Clara with a lot of identification one had the face of an ego the other one had a face of a lion one had the face of a man and the fourth one had the face of an ox now so these these these turbines he called him and they had their wings locked together one facing this way one facing this way one foot in that way one facing this other way and if they should move they move in this direction or the move in this direction they moved this way and move this way when they are going this way and if it is the face of a man all of your strength is behind the face of a man if the eleven were all of this word all of the anointing of that of an ego they unite gets trained and aghoris an ego they don't break apart they move together like that praise the Lord let me read something a little bit to you from revelation series it will help you now watch this whenever when now to go the win and the turn net weather when they could in turn if they was going this way it was going like a man this one does not turn no he had this guy behind him to take care of whatever is there when which direction they are going the goals in that direction and Bill's honor death anointing praise the Lord Ezekiel call them turbans but we were father in the book of Revelation there they are the anointing that has been guiding the church the anointing that God has kept his people on earth because is the anointing that breaks the York is the anointing that does the work is the anointing that changed our lives [Applause] praise the Lord that's the reason why you find people we they come to church they tried to practice to become a good Christian you don't practice it you don't go to school to learn it amen God comes down and he get a hold of you he gets you into that cycle and when it's moving you have to move that's the reason why sometimes you behave in you don't even know why you behave the way you behave and because you are not in control of it it's something that is in control of you that's what a Christian life is praise the Lord amen so God has protected his church can you remember in The Book of Numbers when the people were growing out of out of the promised land they were traveling down there and had to go by the way of the land of more and Balaam by like the king higher bill and to come and curse these people just a little group of people that mean that there were not classy people that just a small group of people led by a prophet Moses they never had an army praise the Lord because God promised that I would send my angel for before you amen it was not a different angel it was the angel rifle Genesis that was promised to keep the church or that is the reason why it does not fear us to say dangers a year this morning because we know it's angels that are keeping us since Eden God has always associate dangers supernatural healing deliverance because those are the attributes those are the things that are in God and they're for your benefit praise the Lord God don't need to be heal he don't need to be here he's just a healer to heal you praise the Lord he don't need to be delivered that's why he's the deliverer to deliver you praise the Lord oh my what a wonderful God we say Amen I read something a little bit a game from revelation series sorry I got I got a little bit caravan dealing I didn't send those things back there to back it so but if you want them I can share them with you craz the Lord amen now he beheld the living in just behold one one will upon the earth about a living angel now you have you have to see it was Ezekiel talks by the wheels in the middle of the wheels I mean there was one wheel and another wheel and another wheel and another wheel praise Allah just watch this now he says here with his four faces and in the appearance their work was like coal burning and and and they have four and therefore how one likeness and their appearance and their work it was a wheel in the middle of the wheel what the symbol what what is the symbol about what is it it means that these guys now you see that is the reason why even the New Testament open with Matthew Mark Luke and John the Full Gospel now and if you read the four Gospels what are they talking about I don't want talking about the same story it just a much you presented a little bit different Mac presented a little bit different praise the Lord now you will realize that it's only in Matthew the book of Matthew Margie is the older one that spoke about the three wise men why because much you honor his anointing he saw Jesus inspiration his anointing was presenting Jesus the king praise the Lord mark in his gospel when he talked about the Lord Jesus he goes back to a Jeremy of prophecy where the Bible talks about Jehovah seven so mark present Jesus like a seven praise Allah in him go to the Gospel of Luke when Luke starts to talk about Jesus now you will realize they even look was now one of the disciples he was not a twelve disciple this was a learned man this was a physician by Korea praise the Lord it brings us honor the mains anointing men's intelligence milk yields his intelligent by the report that he gathered to be able to write a testimony of Jesus Christ what are we talking about people who should go for us this man they gave their life to the cause of the gospel they were not playing with God in your life leave a son alive in and enter the rest of the time honor some kind of for influence let me tell you God has the greatest influence the power of the influence of the Holy Ghost in more than the drug I mean this Holy Ghost can intoxicate you better than an alcohol can do because when the alcohol get out of you you remember all your sorrow is just like a new it goes even in your sorrow you still have joy Oh what are we talking about and when John wrote about Jesus low-riding in John chapter 1 well he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the war was good I mean he was talking about things that have nothing to do with her baby in the manger come on people he's not talking about a baby in the manger he's not talking about joe said he's not talking about Mary he's talking about God in the beginning and all things was created by him him nothing was created the word that was in the beginning became flesh and dwelt among us that was his testimony oh there was some Eagles at 19 taking us in the height praise the Lord boy every one of them was talking about Jesus talking about his ministry John is the only person that talks about you must be born again John chapter 3 he's the only person that talks about the comforter he's the only person that talks about the Holy Ghost the Holy girls who come in order why because he was on a different anointing amen and everything that John speaks about the rest of the Gospels supported everything that Matthew speaks about the rest of the gospel supported because that's how there's four beats move when one move everybody stand behind it praise the Lord even go Luke was not a disciple but everything he spoke about the rest of the gospel supported because it was God it's the word of God my my my praise the Lord are we together are you ready for 2020 are you ready for 2020 and you ready for the challenge of 2020 are you ready for the devil of 2020 praise the Lord because if you think the devil was bilasa him or worse he had the face that you had never seen so you have to prepare yourself pres Alaura amen because if he comes in a way that you have seen you will know that he's the one so he have a most key remarks oh but we can say this morning greater is He that is in us then he that is in the word praise the Lord come on man we can say come what may and we can stand with the old seven job and say even if he sled us we were still trust him praise the Lord amen don't follow me and say Amen oh you gotta be sure amen I'm not just trying to hide are you you gotta be sure you gotta know where you are spinning with your power and your election show did you tell me there is going to be a different year if I've never been committed of God I'm going to be more committed to him it must be no personal testimony I'm not putting words in your mouth amen it must come from your heart you must mean it because I wouldn't be there when the devil meets you you can't call me on the phone I was staying with you but I will not be there praise the Lord he will have to meet you Fred before you call me praise the Lord Amen and you see the funny thing when people call me on the phone I don't want to them I run to the church to pray praise the Lord so you will have to be dealing with it on terror until help comes on the way because our helps come from the Lord our helps does not comes from man it comes from the Lord praise the Lord oh my what a God we fail he's a living God people this God is a living God praise the Lord he's a Living God we can go from from one testimony to another testimony and any and every positive the microphone around every one of you from your own mouth can be able to testify that God is the Living God and then if he's a living God we must not treat him like a dead one amen we must not treat him like a dead God let's treat him like a living God if you live in our homes he should live in our hearts praise the Lord we must take him to the dear places and if you think your God can go there then it's not safe for you to go there praise the Lord if there is a place that you can take God then it's not safe for you praise the Lord amen I'm just saying Happy New Year that's all I'm saying and now even stop preaching it I'm just telling you Happy New Year praise the Lord are you ready for 2020 oh my glory be to God amen if God is God you answer by fire and he can answer by fire praise the Lord that's a that's a that's a that's a Lord in nature there's a Lord in nature you you go to every religion they believe that God is one it's just there they have different ways to explain it I mean even in Christianity we would say some we say he's one God but yet he's he's three they have different ways you go to the Buddhist is because one it's a very unique number amen and it shows the kind of a point out to to to the deity it speaks of a supernatural intelligence there is one beyond every power and none can be compared praise the Lord - always speaks about confirmation praise the Lord that is the reason why you never found one man to the author for them to bless him because it takes two to hard to agree that we want to make a family for a to STATS so what whatever to agreed upon amen - is always the number of agreement praise the Lord even though I don't want to go into all of these things praise the Lord people marry their homeland marry different things and when they they alone say the bow so it's upon them alone to keep the commitment and not on the other one agreement does not work like that whatsoever - agreed upon praise the Lord three speaks of a number of completion in some sense for biblically who see it as a number of protection delivering five speaks of grace six it's the number of men praise the Lord the reason why I'm coming in two days because in Isaiah chapter six there were six dangers six Serafin and you see that it's a universal number it's a universal number the Bible in the book of Revelation also speaks about it they say is the number of a man he died have wisdom that he count the number of a man but it's a universal number praise the Lord six is so much identified two men that when he dies they put him six feet it's so much identified two men is all over the world who wrote that it's written in an unwritten law it's so much identified two men that even when they escort his coffin is all it's always six person no matter how big he is no matter how tall he is it's always made for six person to ask Ari why because it's the number of name now you will see that God is so unique in his word and the things that he does there those things lay there and and and and may want to use the thing that God has placed in nature to prove that he's wise the psychologists and all of these people they just use reasoning from nature they don't want the God of creation but they want his great wisdom to solve their problem praise the Lord now this this experience that Isaiah had is so much attached to us that God had to witness about six angels six surfing's the reason is because you will see it read from Isaiah chapter one if you know if you don't have a Bible reading that you have started here let me give you one start reading from Isaiah chapter one and then as you go alone and get to a chapter 6 chapter 5 a chapter 4 you will see there in chapter 4 is where he talked about the branch of the Lord will be glorious in chapter 4 he talks about how seven women will hold on to one man and in all of those things but when he comes to this chapter six after he had this experience with the danger his message change Prison Law it's right in in Chapter 7 verse 9 the first time he would talk about a virgin shall conceive or he will speak about I'll give you a sign amen as I had 7:14 did the prophecy of a virgin conceived you will see how that experience in Isaiah chapter 6 affecting his life so much until he started prophesying about the redemption of man praise the Lord influence him it lifted him so high in his ministry the Isaiah is the only Bible prophet and the book in the Bible that covered the entire Bible since the sixth chapter he's the one that spoke about how Lucifer fell from heaven he spoke about the Millennial he spoke about the the the end of the world that's that experience that he had lifting him so high praise the Lord amen and that's exactly what God was going to do to the human race amen man was going to come into such an experience with the a maker well God will not just be a theory that we can pass down he will be what we can experience praise the Lord we can experience him in our body in our lives in our homes praise the Lord musicians you can come forward we'll be back this evening let me not keep you too long amen actually you say you ready for 2020 back there God brought 7-6 Angels and the higher their wings all thither to one another and it was spinning moving in such a fast move now as I said their tree filled the temple because they were moving so fast praise the Lord go back to history you come to come we have a little picture out there in the aisle when you enter the building that picture was taken by the photograph people that loved nature and when they see things in the heavens they like to take it going over horizonal and over the the Mexican desert and it was just moving in the heaven and were cloud that was moving so fast by the way angel's wings take it together praise the Lord and just like how those six angels were sent to influence the life of this prophet to bring us prophecy of a Redemption prophecy of the Millennium gave us prophecy of the fold of the devil take us back to time even when there was there was no time that's the same way this time seven angels came with the earth influence and they had a message when man fell in the Garden of Eden God protected the truth of life with angels he called them children when Jesus was born he just came down and told the shippers it was injures that told the shipper the king Gisborne [Music] praise the

don't know what are your plans for this year but I want to invite you praise the Lord I want to invite you [Music] I want to be just like Isaiah said and just imagine he was so terrified by the
