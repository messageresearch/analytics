[0:07] see brother Neville bleezin laying on of
[0:10] hands I see it got a couple of questions
[0:17] now I'll get these tomorrow night calls
[0:20] I don't have time to look through them
[0:21] tonight for you and perhaps on last
[0:23] night's message now if any one has a
[0:28] question on angel message just lay them
[0:31] up one night and I can pick them up the
[0:33] next night now tomorrow night I would
[0:37] like to find or have rather some
[0:41] ministers if possible if not some good
[0:45] solid man
[0:48] or women that we could call on in the
[0:52] time of need that in the event tomorrow
[0:57] night we start after the message to
[1:00] laying on hands and for the Holy Spirit
[1:04] and then there'll be a you have your
[1:07] privilege of staying right here if you
[1:09] wished you all through the holidays if
[1:11] it takes that long to die and then then
[1:17] if not if you desire to go to your own
[1:20] home while we would be glad if you get
[1:24] in a place where you just don't know
[1:26] where to go we want to get some
[1:28] ministers their numbers if their
[1:31] visitors their numbers where they're
[1:33] staying and where we could get a hold of
[1:36] them right away and get one in one home
[1:38] one in another one another that they
[1:40] could give you instructions you are
[1:43] going to seek for this great blessing
[1:45] that we're talking about the baptism of
[1:48] the Holy Spirit last night we were
[1:52] speaking what it was what was the Holy
[1:56] Spirit and we found it to be just about
[2:00] everything that God promised to us in it
[2:04] we found just what God's church would
[2:07] need we found it to be a seal a
[2:11] comforter the rest
[2:14] and the joy and the peace and the
[2:17] resurrection and all that God promised
[2:21] to his church lays within the holy
[2:23] spirit and now tonight we want to preach
[2:27] on or talk on teach on I have about
[2:31] three or four sheets of texture or
[2:34] scriptures on it and which last night I
[2:37] left my Cruden's concordance laying here
[2:40] and I didn't get it and I just had to go
[2:43] through the best I could today with the
[2:45] scriptures now and tomorrow tonight
[2:49] we're teaching off what was the purpose
[2:52] of God sending the Holy Spirit what's it
[2:54] for
[2:55] if it's such a great thing then why did
[2:58] God send it then tomorrow night we want
[3:02] to talk on is it for you and how do you
[3:07] get it and how do you know when you've
[3:10] got it and then after we get through
[3:13] that with the Scriptures explained it by
[3:17] the scriptures using the scriptures for
[3:19] all things then those who are seeking
[3:22] the Holy Spirit will come forward then
[3:25] and then I hope the revival zone from
[3:28] that own to move on then with the Holy
[3:32] Spirit now being at tomorrow night many
[3:36] might stay quite a while at the rooms in
[3:40] the church I feel that if we could get
[3:43] as many ministers and those people who
[3:47] are experienced and leading people to
[3:52] receive the Holy Spirit to encourage
[3:54] them to go into the home with a woman
[3:57] and her husband are or with someone
[4:01] that's seeking the Holy Spirit that's
[4:04] well instructed on what to do if you
[4:07] would just give your phone number or
[4:10] address to the pastor tonight or
[4:13] tomorrow night just give it to brother
[4:15] Neville then that's save us gathering in
[4:18] for a meeting
[4:19] just give your phone number or we could
[4:23] reach you and then say I'll be available
[4:27] and if we want to place me into a home
[4:29] if it's a woman alone then we could send
[4:32] a woman sing to this woman and then if
[4:36] it's in a home where there's a man his
[4:38] wife why we could send a minister and
[4:41] we'd be glad to have you to cooperate
[4:43] because I know you're everyone
[4:46] interested in this this most essential
[4:51] and remember he that saves a soul from
[4:54] his era has covered a multitude of sin
[4:57] see and the Bride of Christ is hungered
[5:01] and thirsting she's in travail to give
[5:04] birth to the children of God now tonight
[5:11] before we read the scriptures let us bow
[5:15] our heads just a moment for prayer and
[5:21] just before we pray you with your heads
[5:23] bowed would you have a request just
[5:26] raise your hands and say God I solemnly
[5:28] raised my hands I have need I pray that
[5:32] you'll help me O Lord God bless each of
[5:36] you he sees your hands the Angels have
[5:38] taken their requests down and a heavenly
[5:44] father we now come approaching thee
[5:49] again in prayer which no doubt that
[5:53] prayer has already been made among the
[5:56] children of God tonight in this little
[5:59] place and it's songs have been sung and
[6:03] we have lifted hearts and joyful
[6:07] rejoicings at the praises of God David
[6:11] said he would come into the congregation
[6:14] of the saints and make his requests
[6:17] known and tonight there has been many
[6:21] hands perhaps maybe I would say 80% of
[6:27] those that are sitting in this building
[6:29] tonight raise their
[6:31] for request shows Lord that we just
[6:37] can't go without you
[6:39] we've got to have you day by day you are
[6:45] our life our joy our health our
[6:51] sustaining strength our stay our buckler
[6:55] our shield from the enemy and we just
[7:01] could not fight this battle of life
[7:03] without you it would be totally
[7:06] impossible for us to do it and we have
[7:10] to totally rely upon you for we know
[7:15] that we're walking to a dark and dismal
[7:20] land on every side the enemy has beset
[7:24] us on givin traps and snares our paths
[7:30] larger set full of snares of the enemy
[7:33] to upset us and we to know at the end of
[7:39] the road we got that long shadowy Valley
[7:43] called death to walk through Oh Lord who
[7:49] would hold our hands then we want to
[7:53] know you now Lord we want to know that
[7:57] you've got our hands and we got your
[8:00] hand that we can have that anchored
[8:03] assurance that when we come to that last
[8:08] great moment of our life that either
[8:12] into that door called death that we can
[8:16] say with the saint of old I know him in
[8:20] the power of his resurrection now I know
[8:24] that when he calls I'll come out from
[8:27] among the dead now father God we would
[8:31] pray that you bless our requests in our
[8:34] gathering bless our words and if I
[8:39] should say anything that would be
[8:42] contrary to your word are your will thou
[8:45] still has a power to close the mouth as
[8:49] you did in the din of lines when Daniel
[8:54] was present and we pray Lord that you
[8:58] would open ears and hearts tonight that
[9:02] and create in them a hunger and thirst
[9:06] may they be so thirsty that they cannot
[9:10] sleep our rest nowhere until the
[9:14] comforter has come we believe that we
[9:18] are living in the last days in the
[9:21] shadow of his coming that's what these
[9:25] messages are directed to Lord it's far
[9:29] the people to take heed take warning and
[9:33] maybe tonight we just pull off the shell
[9:36] right now lit over on the side of the
[9:40] bench said Lord God I am a receptacle to
[9:45] you
[9:46] let your spirit surge through me mold me
[9:51] and make me after that I will I'll yield
[9:55] my heart my strength my all to thy call
[9:59] your ass Lord we not here to be seen on
[10:04] this rainy night we are not here just
[10:08] for no place else to go
[10:10] we are here for one solemn sacred holy
[10:16] purpose in our hearts that is to draw
[10:19] nigh unto you knowing that you've
[10:22] promised if we would draw nigh unto you
[10:26] you draw nigh unto us and that's why we
[10:31] are here he that comes in hungry will
[10:35] not go out hungry blessed are they that
[10:38] do hunger and thirst for righteousness
[10:40] said Jesus far they shall be filled and
[10:47] if we ask for bread we will not receive
[10:51] a stone we have that assurance and if we
[10:55] ask for fish we will not receive a
[10:57] serpent but God our Father will feed us
[11:01] with the manna of heaven his word and
[11:06] his spirit that bear record of him
[11:10] answer our prayers Lord in our requests
[11:13] as we further wait on thee in Jesus

[12:03] remember you that have the red letter
[12:05] Bibles it's in red this is it's the
[12:10] words that Jesus himself spoke on so

[12:19] will be just as he has said heavens and
[12:23] earth will pass away but his word shall
[12:26] never fail now we shall read from the
[12:32] fourteenth verse of the fourteenth
[12:34] chapter if ye shall ask anything in my
[12:40] name I will do it what a blessed promise
[12:48] if you love me keep my Commandments and
[12:52] I will pray the father and he shall give
[12:57] you another comforter that he may abide
[13:01] with you forever even the Spirit of
[13:08] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[13:12] because it seeth him not now you that
[13:20] would be reading from a Greek Bible
[13:21] would see it in your not see their means
[13:25] to understand for the world
[13:28] understandeth him not that is so true
[13:35] let me read it again now even the Spirit
[13:38] of Truth who the Truth whom the world

[14:30] while and the world seeth me no more but

[14:42] shall live also that that day you shall
[14:50] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[14:56] and I in you there's going to be the
[15:01] center of my thought but we're going to
[15:02] read a little farther let me read that
[15:05] also now again at that day the great day
[15:09] the Judgment Day that day you shall know
[15:14] that I am in the father and he and me
[15:19] and I in you he that has my Commandments
[15:24] and keepeth them he it is that loveth me

[15:34] my father and I will love him and will
[15:38] manifest myself to him Judas said unto
[15:44] him not is a carrot Lord how is it that
[15:50] thou will manifest ourselves to us and
[15:53] not to the world
[15:56] that's cosmos a world order if you got a
[16:00] larger eating there you'll notice mines
[16:02] of G and says over your cosmos our world
[16:06] system that's churches and so forth how
[16:10] is it that you will manifest yourself to
[16:13] us and not to them how can you do it
[16:17] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[16:21] man love me he will keep my words and my
[16:30] father will love him and we will come
[16:34] unto him and make our abode with him he
[16:43] that loveth me not keepeth not my sans
[16:49] you might keep the church's sayings but
[16:51] keep his sands easy and the words which
[16:55] ye hear is not mine but the father which
[17:00] sent me these things have I spoken unto
[17:03] you being yet present with you but the
[17:08] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[17:11] the father will send in my name he shall
[17:17] teach you all things and bring all these
[17:21] things that's his words to your
[17:24] remembers whatsoever I have said unto
[17:27] you what purpose did God send the Holy
[17:33] Spirit then may add his blessings to his
[17:37] words Jesus said that at that day you'll
[17:43] know that I am in the father and the
[17:48] father is in me and you're I'm in you
[17:52] and you're in me now if we were going to
[17:56] say this now remember this is going to
[18:03] be on tape our Christian businessman out
[18:08] of Louisville called me a while ago and
[18:10] he said it's a shame Billy that these
[18:14] messages like you said last night
[18:16] doesn't get to 40,000 here instead of a
[18:20] hundred and fifty two hundred three
[18:22] hundred people at your little tabernacle
[18:24] I said sir in six months from now Jesus
[18:29] Terry
[18:30] the whole world around will hear this
[18:34] damn tape school all over the world all
[18:39] around and therefore we are teaching
[18:46] here now just what we believe to be
[18:50] truth and what we have found out that
[18:53] God has confirmed it to us to be true
[18:56] now the purpose what was what was God's
[19:02] purpose in sending the Holy Spirit our
[19:07] mark got down John 14 beginning at the
[19:10] fourteenth person reading through the
[19:12] chapter or the basis God's purpose we
[19:16] find here in sending the Holy Spirit was
[19:20] one purpose that God himself
[19:23] might dwell in his church and continue
[19:28] his plans through the church that God
[19:33] was in Christ continuing his plans
[19:38] through Christ out of Christ into the
[19:41] church continuing his work through the
[19:44] church now we know what the Holy Spirit
[19:47] is we found out last night that it's
[19:50] gone now when we think of God the Father
[19:55] as Jesus spoke of here his father God
[19:59] the Son as Jesus God the Holy Spirit as
[20:04] what we call it today now that does not
[20:08] mean that there is three individual
[20:11] distinct gods it means that there is one
[20:16] God in three offices may we say it like
[20:22] this all that God was he poured into
[20:32] Christ because he emptied himself and
[20:38] poured it into Christ and Christ was the
[20:43] Onis of the Godhead bodily all that
[20:49] Jehovah was he poured into Christ and
[20:53] all that Christ was he poured into the
[20:58] church not into one individual but into
[21:02] the entire body there were we come
[21:05] together in unity we have power all that
[21:10] God was was in Christ and all that
[21:13] Christ was is in you for God was made
[21:18] flesh and dwelt among us 1st Timothy
[21:21] 3:16 if you're putting it down without
[21:23] controversy great is the mystery of
[21:26] godliness for God was manifested in the
[21:30] flesh we handling God Jehovah made flesh
[21:37] and walked on the earth and we saw him
[21:40] with her eyes you know in the same
[21:43] chapter of John 14 Phillips said Lord
[21:47] show us the father and it will satisfy
[21:50] us Jesus said I've been so long with you
[21:54] Philip and you don't know me when you
[21:58] have seen me you have seen the father
[22:02] and why sailor style unto me show us the
[22:05] father God was made flesh now here it is
[22:12] the father was God over you we're saying
[22:17] we've been since Adam God the Father was
[22:22] over Moses and the children of Israel in
[22:26] a pillar of fire then God with us in
[22:32] Christ walk with us talk with us eat
[22:35] with the slept with us guard over us God
[22:40] with us and now God in us
[22:48] all God was come into Christ all Christ
[22:52] was come into the church what is it God
[22:57] working in you and he were in a world he
[23:02] want to call on your right there working
[23:05] in you to do his good will how we are to
[23:11] thank God for them God the Holy Spirit
[23:16] is sent for the purpose of God living in
[23:23] his church moving to each age working
[23:29] out his divine will when man make fun of
[23:33] you they're not making fun of you they
[23:36] were making fun of him that sent you so
[23:43] jesus said blessed are ye when men shall
[23:47] say all manner of evil against you
[23:49] falsely for my namesake blessed are you
[23:55] and again all that live godly in Christ
[23:59] Jesus shall suffer persecution for when
[24:03] God made himself known in Christ they
[24:06] hated him who hate him worst the church
[24:11] the church hated him worse they hated
[24:15] him worse than to the drunkard they
[24:18] hated him worse than all the other
[24:20] people it was a church that hated him so
[24:24] therefore when you see cosmos the world
[24:27] are the world noti'm not means the
[24:30] church so call knew him not he came to
[24:35] his own and his own received him not but
[24:40] as many as did receive him to them gave
[24:43] he the power to become sons of God to
[24:48] them have believed on his name all how
[24:51] we should love him and worship Him
[24:53] the purpose
[24:55] of God wanting to become in fellowship
[25:03] like before we leave that text let's use
[25:08] this in the days of Ruth in the law of
[25:13] redemption when neo mahat the country
[25:17] because of trial hard times she went
[25:23] into the mobile night land which were
[25:26] just lukewarm nominal Christians because
[25:30] the mova nights come from the daughter
[25:32] of lot and they were so-called believers
[25:38] and mixed up and then her husband died
[25:43] and her two sons died and on the road
[25:46] home neoman Ruth neo my honor at home
[25:53] heard one of her daughter-in-laws Orpah
[25:56] she said that she would return back to
[25:59] her country to her gods into her church
[26:02] and to her people and the oume tried to
[26:06] get Ruth to go back but she said your
[26:11] people are my people your God is my God
[26:17] where you die there I'll die where
[26:20] you're buried there I'll be buried
[26:24] not turn back that's when a person's
[26:29] caught evasion no mega-diverse whatever
[26:32] people said you're going over there to
[26:34] become a holy roller something that
[26:36] didn't make any difference to Ruth there
[26:40] was a purpose of God to be fulfilled and
[26:44] just as sure as you're hungry tonight
[26:47] for the holy spirit it's something in
[26:50] you pulling you that a purpose of God in
[26:53] your life has got to be fulfilled just
[26:58] like it was with Ruth the story so
[27:01] beautiful I just can't leave it for a
[27:03] moment you know the law of redemption
[27:07] that went boys you know the story of how
[27:11] Ruth gleaned in the field and found
[27:14] favor with Boaz and before he could
[27:18] marry her he had to redeem all that knee
[27:24] OMA had lost and the only one that could
[27:29] redeem me almost fallen estate in the
[27:32] law of redemption was a near kinsman had
[27:38] to be kinfolks before he could redeem
[27:44] and that was her closest kin folks and
[27:49] he had to make a public in sign outside
[27:52] of the gate or public confession that he
[27:57] had redeemed all that knee OMA had lost
[28:01] and Boaz did it by taking off his shoe
[28:04] before the elders instead of there's
[28:06] anybody here that's got anything that
[28:09] belongs to the OMA
[28:11] this day have redeemed it and that soy
[28:19] God did follow his own laws God cannot
[28:24] follow give you one law to follow him
[28:26] follow another he follows his own laws
[28:30] then God in order to redeem the last
[28:35] church
[28:38] the last world the lost creation God who
[28:43] is infinite in spirit to redeem the loss
[28:50] human race God himself become kinfolks
[28:55] a man a son that he created in the womb
[29:03] of Mary and then he made an ensign or a
[29:09] testimony outside the gates of Jerusalem
[29:13] he was lifted up between the heavens and
[29:16] earth and died and redeemed everything
[29:21] and bleeding he sanctified a church that
[29:25] he himself might live in in fellowship
[29:30] and commune with that lost spot of
[29:34] fellowship from the Garden of Eden where
[29:38] God came down every evening church time
[29:41] did you notice God came down in the cool
[29:45] of the day the setting of the Sun
[29:48] there's something about when he starts
[29:51] to get night people think of church and
[29:54] of God Christians you see the Sun
[29:59] setting you realize that your Sun is
[30:01] setting I did the cool evening he come
[30:04] down and commune with them and there he
[30:09] lost that fellowship because seed will
[30:12] not let him do it and then he was made
[30:14] flesh and dwelt among us in order that
[30:16] he could come back again to man and live
[30:23] in man
[30:25] and restore man
[30:28] to a state of communion with him again
[30:32] and give him back his god-given right
[30:36] that's what he did that's the purpose of
[30:40] the holy ghost it's the father again
[30:43] God the Father dwelling in you working
[30:49] out his plans to finish his plan of
[30:52] redemption working through you making
[30:57] you a co-worker with him giving you a
[31:01] place giving you a part for your foul
[31:07] and loss brother and sister giving you
[31:12] his spirit in his love to go hunt the
[31:17] lost as he did in the Garden of Eden
[31:19] Adam Adam where art thou that's what the
[31:23] Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman
[31:26] when it strikes into their heart and
[31:28] takes its abode there's a thirst and a
[31:32] hungry force all souls that's what's the
[31:35] matter with the meetings today there's
[31:37] not enough spirit touch in it
[31:39] Gold for the souls of the lost and the
[31:43] dying it's more to make a name our
[31:48] church or a building our denomination
[31:50] instead of a soul-winning program how
[31:57] pitiful we just stay on it much God
[32:02] poured himself into Christ correct
[32:06] Christ poured himself into the church
[32:09] therefore now watch at that day you will
[32:14] know that I am in the father and you are
[32:22] in me and I am in you and that day
[32:27] you'll know it for it's the whole thing
[32:30] is one plan of redemption coming down
[32:34] that God coming back to live in and
[32:37] dwell with and commune to his people as
[32:40] he did at the beginning now then as soon
[32:46] as he gets his church in
[32:48] speaking conditions gets his church to a
[32:52] place that he could flow himself through
[32:54] and love and persuade and fellowship and
[33:02] thou , Eden he'll take his church back
[33:09] to an Eden again there or it fell it no
[33:18] that's work made its first start of fall
[33:20] There s word will be taken right back
[33:23] with every clean slate of redemption
[33:26] bringing them straight back to that
[33:28] place again the church has been in the
[33:32] world for some time and the church
[33:35] really after the Reformation of 1500
[33:39] years of dark ages Luther was the first
[33:44] reformer to come forth after the round
[33:47] of the Apostles I then when Luther come
[33:51] forth God tipped up a little bit of the
[33:55] spirit and poured it out upon the church
[33:58] in justification and then in the days of
[34:03] Wesley he poured out a little more of
[34:05] yourself into sanctification and as the
[34:09] age has grown on to the end time God has
[34:15] been filling his church just look around
[34:20] and find out if that's true or not look
[34:23] at the Lutheran age you who read history
[34:27] look at their revival and what they did
[34:29] look how much greater the Wesley revival
[34:33] was how much more power they had but in
[34:35] the minority watch in the days of
[34:38] Pentecost what a revival they had Dan
[34:42] what a great wide sweeping to our Sunday
[34:46] visitor the Catholic paper give
[34:49] confession that the Pentecostals
[34:52] produced 1,500,000 conversions in one
[34:57] year
[34:59] I've done over the rest of churches
[35:02] together the Catholic only changed claim
[35:06] the million in their own Sunday visitor
[35:08] the paper called the Sunday visitor gave
[35:12] statement that the Pentecostals outrun
[35:16] them and remember a Pentecostal
[35:19] conversion just holy ghost few
[35:22] conversions in the minority to start
[35:26] with on the side of the alley out there
[35:29] with a low get tired and women couldn't
[35:32] even afford a pair of stockings laying
[35:35] out on the railroad tracks and picking
[35:37] up corn and mash it and making bread for
[35:39] their children but once it come to the
[35:43] most powerful standing Church in the
[35:46] world a not in the eyes of the world but
[35:50] in the eyes of God because he proves it
[35:53] but what he's doing for him he's pouring
[35:55] yourself into him pouring it in notice
[36:01] down what taken place God pouring
[36:05] yourself into them now the church has
[36:07] got to a place from Luther Wesley and
[36:10] the revival zones the Pentecost and now
[36:13] into this age that we're coming now by
[36:17] the same Holy Spirit just more of it now
[36:20] when them Luther's back there got saved
[36:23] they got a potion of the Holy Spirit
[36:27] when the Methodists got sanctified that
[36:30] was a work of the Holy Spirit see it was
[36:36] a part of the Holy Spirit they without
[36:39] us are not made perfect says the
[36:42] scripture see now God as the life has
[36:47] begin to shine in the last days he is
[36:50] expecting us a great thing from us
[36:53] because for there's much given there's
[36:56] much required so he's going to require
[37:00] much more of us than it is of the
[37:02] Luthor's of the Methodist because we
[37:05] walk in a greater light with a greater
[37:07] power whether graters a greater
[37:11] a witness then they had now we have a
[37:15] greater witness of the resurrection
[37:17] we have things more firmer more sure
[37:20] than they had but it's just like I said
[37:24] to a Lutheran College that long gold
[37:26] they said what have we got
[37:28] I said a man plaintiff II lakorn the
[37:31] first little blades come up he said
[37:33] thank the Lord for a grip a crop of corn
[37:36] potentially he had it but he only had it
[37:39] in the early farm
[37:42] by-and-by become a stalking a tassel
[37:46] come out on it which was Methodist if
[37:49] you watch nature you'll see God working
[37:52] there's a secret lies there that even
[37:55] goes with my ministry thing that
[37:57] watching nature CI does what age and
[38:01] what time you see where you're living
[38:03] watch the age now then the Methodists
[38:07] they were tussles they look back to the
[38:10] Luther's that we got sanctification you
[38:12] haven't gotten up and in it by and by
[38:15] from that pollen from the Methodists
[38:17] come forth a grain of car here
