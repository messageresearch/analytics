[1:02:30] the Lord
[1:02:31] he's good let's let's take Hebrew

[1:02:35] and uh and the Bible says here wherefore
[1:02:39] holy brethrens
[1:02:41] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[1:02:45] consider
[1:02:47] the apostle
[1:02:50] and high priests
[1:02:52] of our profession
[1:02:55] Jesus Christ
[1:02:57] praise the Lord
[1:02:59] Wednesday Wednesday night we were
[1:03:00] speaking on on Paul an apostle of Jesus
[1:03:04] Christ
[1:03:05] this morning we are reading about the
[1:03:09] apostle
[1:03:11] and the High Praise of our profession
[1:03:16] Jesus Christ
[1:03:18] let's pray together
[1:03:19] father we have just read a verse in your
[1:03:23] word
[1:03:24] and oh God you said
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:28] Heaven and Earth
[1:03:30] may pass away Lord but not one
[1:03:34] drop of your word we ever fail
[1:03:37] dear Lord we want to just pray that you
[1:03:40] come and meet us this morning and take
[1:03:43] your word break it to our hearts so
[1:03:45] father and just pray that you will help
[1:03:48] me and help the Saints also Lift us up
[1:03:52] together Lord Jesus as we lift your name
[1:03:54] Up in Jesus name we pray amen amen the
[1:03:59] Lord bless you praise the Lord
[1:04:01] so we see Paul here uh
[1:04:06] uh calling our lord Jesus the apostle
[1:04:10] and high Priests of our profession
[1:04:13] Christ Jesus
[1:04:15] and so there's uh we want to continue in
[1:04:20] our our subject like I said on on uh on
[1:04:25] Wednesday night we we will go into
[1:04:28] talking about the nature of the ministry
[1:04:31] so that's the reason why I read that
[1:04:34] verse because Jesus is our Apostle amen
[1:04:39] he is the Apostle of all Apostles praise
[1:04:43] the Lord
[1:04:44] in a book uh impeded letter Peter called
[1:04:47] him the chief Shepherd
[1:04:50] praise the Lord
[1:04:51] Paul being the apostle
[1:04:53] Peter being the shepherd
[1:04:56] Peter calls him the chief Shepherd so
[1:04:58] he's the chief Shepherd he's the pastor
[1:05:01] of all pastors
[1:05:03] and uh and he's the Apostle of all
[1:05:06] Apostles he's an apostle because he was
[1:05:09] sent by God
[1:05:11] to bring us Redemption and Apostle is
[1:05:15] the one that is sin praise the Lord the
[1:05:18] one that is saying is the Apostle now
[1:05:22] I was trying uh realizing that we we
[1:05:26] just came through uh last weekend
[1:05:29] services and uh just trying to be
[1:05:34] thankful for for for our assembly and
[1:05:38] the years that the Lord has has kept us
[1:05:40] together as a church I'm hoping that we
[1:05:42] can be able to have a a Saturday
[1:05:46] and and what I want to do is the other
[1:05:50] uh I want I want you to bring
[1:05:54] questions of any kind if you have any uh
[1:05:58] whether you want to bring it that day or
[1:06:00] you want to just write it and give it to
[1:06:02] the deacons that would be good we want
[1:06:04] to use that for uh a question and answer
[1:06:09] section it would not be streamed online
[1:06:12] I don't want it to be stream online and
[1:06:15] also we will use that to talk about some
[1:06:19] things that is that's that's concerned
[1:06:21] in the church
[1:06:22] uh we we they might recall it and then
[1:06:26] uh uh just keep it in the in the in the
[1:06:32] Church
[1:06:33] online icon but we would not I would not
[1:06:36] want it to be streamed and uh
[1:06:40] because we'll be talking in-house things
[1:06:43] so we try to work on a date here and uh
[1:06:49] and one of the reasons is because just
[1:06:51] as we went through while uh
[1:06:55] last week's service and we have brother
[1:06:58] Stephen giving us a little bit of a
[1:07:01] history of the beginning of the church
[1:07:03] and where we are and some of the few
[1:07:06] things that happened it was very short
[1:07:08] then I thought it was going to be but it
[1:07:10] was okay praise the Lord
[1:07:13] and I think the law designed it that way
[1:07:15] because the the the the power went off
[1:07:18] so we were we were having service in the
[1:07:21] deck but you know there's a scripture
[1:07:24] for that the Bible says the people that
[1:07:26] sat in darkness great light shine
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:31] so uh
[1:07:32] but with that being said and uh
[1:07:38] trusting the Lord for uh uh the the
[1:07:41] years and time that is before us I want
[1:07:45] people to ask questions if you if there
[1:07:48] are things that you want to know and
[1:07:49] understand how the church is wrong and
[1:07:52] how things are done and why this is done
[1:07:55] and why why you preach long as that
[1:07:58] question praise the Lord I will be glad
[1:08:00] I will be glad to answer you why I
[1:08:04] preach long
[1:08:05] praise the Lord and and just just ask
[1:08:08] what any question that you have on your
[1:08:10] mind
[1:08:11] and when your question is if your
[1:08:14] question is so personal we'll pull you
[1:08:16] aside and we'll talk to you praise the
[1:08:18] Lord
[1:08:19] and uh so
[1:08:22] we are working on a date here but I will
[1:08:26] hope that is it will be sometime in in
[1:08:28] August coming up year so we can be able
[1:08:32] to cross that in and uh
[1:08:35] and then continue to move praise the
[1:08:38] Lord because we realize uh uh there's a
[1:08:41] there's a new crop that is growing here
[1:08:43] in this assembly and uh
[1:08:48] from from from Ace many years of
[1:08:50] experience we have people that are
[1:08:54] moving from
[1:08:57] different places
[1:08:58] we inherit you as a Saints of this
[1:09:02] church you inherit us as Pastor things
[1:09:05] and I don't like the way you you used to
[1:09:07] it being done and we're not doing things
[1:09:10] like the way you think that it's
[1:09:11] supposed to be done so let's just find a
[1:09:13] time to talk about all of that there's
[1:09:16] that would be the purpose of that
[1:09:18] service there Saturday and at the end of
[1:09:21] it we had a we have a prayer meeting
[1:09:23] praise the Lord so again that if you you
[1:09:27] have a question anything comes to your
[1:09:28] mind just write it down give it to the
[1:09:31] deacons they will give it to us and then
[1:09:34] we will we'll try to find
[1:09:37] answer to be able to address it I call
[1:09:40] into the word
[1:09:43] praise the Lord
[1:09:44] I call into the word
[1:09:46] now so in that same manner
[1:09:50] I'm taking this subject we started with
[1:09:54] prisoner of love we will get back to
[1:09:57] that but I thought that I should go this
[1:10:01] way uh upon the president of Paul and
[1:10:05] the Apostle and in that way is going to
[1:10:08] help us to address few things too that
[1:10:11] have to do with church order and uh and
[1:10:15] and and the ministry and and different
[1:10:18] things around around the local church
[1:10:20] praise the Lord so this will be more
[1:10:23] like a Sunday school if you want to call
[1:10:26] it a Sunday school or a Bible studies
[1:10:28] but the purpose there is to be able to
[1:10:32] start to address some of the few things
[1:10:34] that have to do with the local church
[1:10:36] and then
[1:10:38] maybe from your questions you'll be able
[1:10:41] to give us an inspiration to be able to
[1:10:44] look at some other things that uh uh uh
[1:10:48] maybe we that is in our blinds you know
[1:10:51] our blind spot
[1:10:54] praise the Lord but we want to say we we
[1:10:57] love and appreciate each and every one
[1:10:59] of you that comes here that make this
[1:11:02] little place a home church and we we
[1:11:06] thank you for your prayers and we will
[1:11:10] thank you for your presence and
[1:11:14] your support whenever you can make it we
[1:11:19] we don't we don't take it for granted
[1:11:21] praise the Lord
[1:11:23] Noah had the grace to preach to animals
[1:11:25] I don't think I have that Grace so I
[1:11:28] neither do I have the grace to preach to
[1:11:31] empty benches I'd rather be on the
[1:11:33] street corner than preaching to empty
[1:11:36] benches so we don't take your presence
[1:11:38] for granted we we respect your presence
[1:11:40] and and also to each and every one of
[1:11:44] you that support this church with your
[1:11:46] Finance
[1:11:47] through ties and offering we also
[1:11:50] appreciate that
[1:11:53] praise the Lord
[1:11:54] amen
[1:11:56] but as we look through this subject
[1:11:58] there are some few things that we would
[1:12:02] like to would like to address amen and
[1:12:06] uh
[1:12:11] I'll read something year
[1:12:13] that we get into that but I will first
[1:12:16] I will first start and said you know uh
[1:12:19] you know the the
[1:12:22] song leader and uh the musicians we we
[1:12:27] work with them as uh as people that uh
[1:12:33] uh
[1:12:35] actually that are on the under my
[1:12:38] Ministry and we we see every one of them
[1:12:41] in some in some way or another as
[1:12:44] ministering to the church through
[1:12:46] singing and through playing music and uh
[1:12:50] and so we try to
[1:12:54] keep a close eye but you see the uh
[1:12:57] sometimes we we we get you you know
[1:13:00] carried away I know brother Lawrence
[1:13:02] talking about the you know the name of
[1:13:04] Jesus and and people being persecuted
[1:13:07] there is a complete difference between
[1:13:10] persecution and The Squeeze
[1:13:13] you know persecution is something that
[1:13:16] uh the church from the day the church
[1:13:20] was birthed
[1:13:21] the the church
[1:13:25] the Bible says Paul says all those that
[1:13:27] take up the name of Jesus
[1:13:29] will go through persecution
[1:13:32] praise the Lord
[1:13:33] The Squeeze is a period of time it's a
[1:13:37] period of time where uh
[1:13:41] you know you look through the Bible it's
[1:13:44] almost like going through the wine press
[1:13:47] okay it's a period of time that is set
[1:13:50] where uh you know we we know with things
[1:13:55] that are happening around the world no
[1:13:58] doubt you know we we know that we we
[1:14:01] want to we do not want to cast things
[1:14:04] off you know and and say so well you
[1:14:07] know maybe it is 50 years from now we
[1:14:10] know that week we can we can see things
[1:14:13] that are happening we know we are coming
[1:14:14] right into that time but you see when
[1:14:17] when you're talking about structural
[1:14:19] things you want to be uh you want to be
[1:14:22] very definite
[1:14:24] why because sometimes when we say things
[1:14:27] across the pulpit it put things on
[1:14:30] people's mind
[1:14:32] okay people thinks on people's mind
[1:14:34] that's the reason why whether we uh we
[1:14:37] uh we are testifying or even when we are
[1:14:40] praying and we we have to watch uh you
[1:14:44] know the uh those things that that comes
[1:14:48] in as our personal coming
[1:14:50] we have to wash that because sometimes
[1:14:52] people think some people mind and you
[1:14:55] keep you you put them to a place where
[1:14:57] they keep thinking and thinking you know
[1:15:00] well what what it is the word whether it
[1:15:02] is not the word and then we want to
[1:15:04] watch all of that
[1:15:07] but just like I said I have a place
[1:15:09] right here uh that I wanted to address
[1:15:13] some of that praise the Lord
[1:15:16] amen
[1:15:18] that I wanted to address some of that
[1:15:23] because I mean even uh I know the
[1:15:28] deacons try to hand me in the the
[1:15:33] the the prayer needs when they come in
[1:15:35] and uh
[1:15:41] actually uh which which of course is a
[1:15:44] good thing we can take that time to to
[1:15:47] be able to bring those things to the
[1:15:49] Lord and but as we were study together
[1:15:52] as we look in these things you will
[1:15:55] realize the other uh in some way the the
[1:16:00] those things
[1:16:02] sometimes must be taken up during the
[1:16:05] service
[1:16:05] during the song service or the deacons
[1:16:09] should be able to take them off but it
[1:16:12] is all because our sun service time uh
[1:16:16] there's a time I loaded for that and and
[1:16:18] sometimes when we use the song service
[1:16:21] time uh just for every other thing that
[1:16:25] we have to use it for and not being
[1:16:28] conscious of the time before you before
[1:16:30] the sun Savvy leader realize you don't
[1:16:33] even have a time to sink you know and
[1:16:35] and then we come you know it just it
[1:16:37] just become a kind of for pleasure so I
[1:16:40] think that's one of the reasons why the
[1:16:41] you know we ask that these requests come
[1:16:45] over to us so we can be able to give a
[1:16:47] little time of worship and and and and
[1:16:50] all of that praise the Lord
[1:16:53] praise the Lord because sometimes uh
[1:16:56] like I've seen over the years we take
[1:16:58] personal needs and then and then we
[1:17:01] started prayer service
[1:17:03] you know if we're if we are to pray for
[1:17:05] the need we must just pray for the for
[1:17:07] the need we must not start a prayer
[1:17:09] service
[1:17:10] you know there is a time for a prayer
[1:17:12] service
[1:17:16] praise the Lord
[1:17:19] now so we we want to talk about this
[1:17:23] we want to talk about this I hope that
[1:17:26] we what I want to establish here is the
[1:17:29] other uh uh hoping that we all will
[1:17:33] realize that this is for the benefit of
[1:17:36] this local church
[1:17:37] okay brother Branham says and and we all
[1:17:40] know there are three things that makes
[1:17:42] you a member of a local church we will
[1:17:45] address that and but I was just thinking
[1:17:48] about it this morning I mean even as as
[1:17:52] an individual you know as an individual
[1:17:55] or or in in our homes and in our family
[1:18:00] one of the principles think is is our
[1:18:05] present
[1:18:07] now if you were in that present year
[1:18:09] this morning
[1:18:12] not in a sense of
[1:18:16] you sitting in your seat but if you were
[1:18:19] not present in this body
[1:18:22] we will say
[1:18:23] the person passed his life
[1:18:27] okay
[1:18:28] beyond your obligation and your
[1:18:32] initiatives
[1:18:36] beyond your obligation even as a human
[1:18:38] the first thing that uh you need to be a
[1:18:43] human is to be present in this body
[1:18:47] that's the first thing that is Major you
[1:18:50] have to be present in this body and
[1:18:54] there there are things that you you are
[1:18:56] obligated to do you must eat and drink
[1:18:59] to keep this body alive
[1:19:01] then there are other things that are
[1:19:03] initiatives you like it you can take
[1:19:05] that if you like it you can take bath
[1:19:07] you can brush your teeth or you know and
[1:19:10] and other things you can find a job if
[1:19:12] you want to you know or you can just sit
[1:19:14] down and uh but
[1:19:17] what you are obligated to do to keep
[1:19:19] yourself alive is that you must eat and
[1:19:23] you must drink
[1:19:24] if you don't eat and drink you'll be
[1:19:26] dead you will not be in this body your
[1:19:29] presence will not be filled
[1:19:32] and that is the same thing that that I
[1:19:34] have to do with being a member of a
[1:19:37] local church the first thing that is
[1:19:39] most important is that you must support
[1:19:41] that church with your presence
[1:19:44] praise the Lord and then your tide is an
[1:19:49] obligation you know because it's
[1:19:52] established in the word of God you know
[1:19:54] you're offering Talent offerings are
[1:19:57] obligation but in the way that it is Set
[1:20:00] uh uh what you gave us an offering is
[1:20:04] like an initiative
[1:20:07] okay you could give a dollar you could
[1:20:09] give 10 cents you could give you know uh
[1:20:12] uh even the rare ones and if you put it
[1:20:15] there we can keep it together and and
[1:20:17] maybe he can meet some need of the
[1:20:19] church you know but that's that is that
[1:20:22] is the way it is said so you just think
[1:20:25] about it you know there is no way that
[1:20:28] you can be alive if you are not present
[1:20:31] in this body
[1:20:35] if you are not present in the body I
[1:20:37] mean there is no way that you can be
[1:20:39] alive
[1:20:39] now so uh let's turn our Bible to
[1:20:42] Ephesians chapter four we want to start
[1:20:45] out from there
[1:20:47] this morning we will be addressing the
[1:20:49] the nature of the ministry
[1:20:52] that's where we stop on Wednesday night
[1:20:58] will be addressing the nature of the
[1:21:01] ministry
[1:21:06] I read a quote from Christ is the
[1:21:08] ministry of God Christ is revealed in
[1:21:10] his own word and brother Branham said
[1:21:12] God has selected the man for the age and
[1:21:15] selected the message and even the nature
[1:21:18] of the man
[1:21:20] the nature of the man you know that's
[1:21:24] that's going to be the the messenger of
[1:21:28] the age God was was uh uh you know paid
[1:21:32] very good attention to his nature so we
[1:21:35] want to look at uh there but to be able
[1:21:39] to do it Ephesians chapter 4 is where
[1:21:42] Paul speaks about the faithful Ministry
[1:21:45] so we want to we want to start from
[1:21:48] there
[1:21:49] this morning
[1:21:58] praise the Lord
[1:22:00] we want to start from there this morning
[1:22:02] and uh
[1:22:09] Ephesians chapter four we start from
[1:22:11] verse one ah therefore the prisoner of
[1:22:14] the Lord beseech you that yeah walk
[1:22:18] warfing of the vocation
[1:22:22] wherewith yeah I called
[1:22:27] you walk wealthy of the vocation
[1:22:31] wherewith yeah I called we have a
[1:22:34] vocation
[1:22:36] our vocation is our calling
[1:22:40] we have a vocation
[1:22:44] our vocation each and every one of us
[1:22:46] here
[1:22:48] our vocation our primary purpose
[1:22:52] well being on Earth is to be a son and a
[1:22:55] daughter of God
[1:22:57] that's your vocation
[1:22:59] every other thing you do is your
[1:23:01] avocation
[1:23:04] your job is your avocation your school
[1:23:07] is your avocation
[1:23:09] and our family life is our avocation
[1:23:14] but
[1:23:15] what we are called to do
[1:23:19] walking worthy of what we are called to
[1:23:23] do
[1:23:24] just imagine when God placed Adam and
[1:23:27] Eve in the garden
[1:23:29] they are sole purpose was to be son and
[1:23:33] daughter of God
[1:23:35] praise the Lord
[1:23:37] and uh
[1:23:41] Adam went about and and found the need
[1:23:45] of naming the animation naming the trees
[1:23:48] and you know giving names to everything
[1:23:50] and and that uh uh but all of that came
[1:23:54] out of his position out of his calling
[1:23:59] because he identified himself as a son
[1:24:03] of God
[1:24:04] he knew that he was an amateur God so
[1:24:08] then he took the right to go about and
[1:24:11] do the other thing name the animals name
[1:24:13] the trees
[1:24:15] he wouldn't have done that if he did not
[1:24:18] know his position
[1:24:20] if he didn't know that he was a Son of
[1:24:23] God in the first place
[1:24:27] praise the Lord
[1:24:28] so Paul is saying in everything we do we
[1:24:33] must walk worthy of this one thing that
[1:24:36] you are a child of God
[1:24:42] that's your vocation you must be able to
[1:24:45] fit it in every part of your life
[1:24:48] is not only for the church door is for
[1:24:51] every part of our life
[1:24:53] we must walk worthy of our vocation
[1:24:58] praise the Lord
[1:25:01] with all loneliness
[1:25:03] and meekness and long-suffering
[1:25:07] forbearing one another in love
[1:25:10] enduring to keep the unity of the spirit
[1:25:15] in the bound of peace
[1:25:18] praise the Lord so we come from you know
[1:25:22] different walks of life every one of us
[1:25:26] have different uh uh uh you know if we
[1:25:30] all should give our testimony definitely
[1:25:32] there will be a different way that God
[1:25:35] call every one of us what will be
[1:25:37] similar is that he call us
[1:25:42] he met us at different times and and all
[1:25:45] of that but what would be similar is
[1:25:48] that he call us and then uh in their
[1:25:52] calling that he call us Paul is saying
[1:25:55] that we must Endeavor we must do
[1:25:58] everything that we can to be able to
[1:26:01] keep the spirit of unity
[1:26:04] the unity of the spirit in the bound of
[1:26:08] peace
[1:26:09] because there are two things they are
[1:26:11] poor we talk about here is the unity of
[1:26:15] the spirit and the unity of the faith
[1:26:18] there can never be the unity of the
[1:26:21] faith without the unity of the spirit
[1:26:25] so just in the way that the Apostle Paul
[1:26:29] presented this
[1:26:31] you you have to know that he's a wise
[1:26:34] master builder and in the way that he
[1:26:37] presented this is just to be he's
[1:26:40] telling us our duty
[1:26:42] our sons and daughters of God what we
[1:26:46] must work for because we I mean every
[1:26:49] one of us have different appetite
[1:26:52] praise the Lord God is a god of
[1:26:55] varieties
[1:26:57] but yet when he bring us together with
[1:27:00] our our differences and and and he wants
[1:27:04] for us to work for one thing is the
[1:27:08] unity let the spirit let the the the the
[1:27:11] the unity of the spirit of peace reign
[1:27:15] among his people
[1:27:16] and that's the reason why the Bible says
[1:27:20] if a brother will offend you go and meet
[1:27:21] him labor try to do something because
[1:27:24] you want to keep the unity of peace
[1:27:27] you want to keep the unity of spirit of
[1:27:29] peace
[1:27:33] praise the Lord
[1:27:34] amen if we see something and and and and
[1:27:38] I mean uh uh we think that it's not
[1:27:41] according to the message I mean you'll
[1:27:42] be you'll be completely wrong to just
[1:27:44] shove your shoulder
[1:27:48] why because the church is one body
[1:27:51] we might come from our individual home
[1:27:53] but this is one body
[1:27:57] God looks at a good shepherd on 6900
[1:28:02] humble Avenue as one body that he said
[1:28:05] in the corner of this street to be a
[1:28:08] lighthouse
[1:28:11] are we together
[1:28:20] now so the Apostle Paul goes ahead there
[1:28:23] is one body
[1:28:25] and one spirit
[1:28:28] even as ye are called in one hope
[1:28:32] of your calling
[1:28:34] one Lord One Faith one baptism
[1:28:40] one God the father of all who is above
[1:28:45] all and through all and in you all
[1:28:51] but unto every one of us is giving Grace
[1:28:56] I calling to the measure
[1:29:02] praise the Lord
[1:29:04] I call into the measure
[1:29:07] of the gift
[1:29:10] of Christ
[1:29:12] amen even though we are one one body but
[1:29:17] then that to every every one of us is
[1:29:21] giving Grace according to the measure so
[1:29:23] every one of us have a measure of Christ
[1:29:27] the Bible says no one can call Jesus the
[1:29:30] Christ except by the Holy Ghost and if
[1:29:34] that is your confession this morning
[1:29:36] then the Holy Ghost is dealing with your
[1:29:38] heart at least you have a measure to
[1:29:41] know that Jesus is Christ
[1:29:44] if that is the only measure you you have
[1:29:47] it's a measure
[1:29:50] praise the Lord
[1:29:52] is a measure the same way that uh a
[1:29:55] teaspoon of the ocean has every element
[1:29:59] of the ocean in it even though it's a
[1:30:02] teaspoon but every element that is in
[1:30:05] that great ocean is still in that
[1:30:08] measure of teaspoon
[1:30:11] praise the Lord so in God's eyes he
[1:30:14] don't look at your measure more than
[1:30:16] this person measured no
[1:30:19] he looks at the component
[1:30:23] he looks at what each measure have
[1:30:25] that's what makes every one of us we are
[1:30:29] the same in the eyes of God
[1:30:32] are we together
[1:30:35] praise the Lord
[1:30:37] wherefore
[1:30:39] he said when he extended up on high
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:46] and give gifts to men
[1:30:50] knowing that each one of us have a
[1:30:53] measure
[1:30:54] when he ascended up her
[1:30:58] praise the Lord
[1:31:00] amen when he ascended up of her let's
[1:31:03] see how David described their let's go
[1:31:06] to Psalm chapter 24.
[1:31:08] let's see how David described that we're
[1:31:10] coming back to to Ephesians here
[1:31:24] Psalm chapter 24 let's see how David
[1:31:28] describe their David yeah that that
[1:31:31] scripture is talking about the extension
[1:31:33] When Jesus ascended uh uh uh going up
[1:31:37] Harbor Abraham says he he he he led
[1:31:41] captivity catches but it also speaks
[1:31:44] between the days
[1:31:48] when Jesus was crucified
[1:31:51] we know that uh uh uh there was a
[1:31:56] prophecy that corruption will not touch
[1:31:58] his body
[1:31:59] so when Jesus died on the cross Peter
[1:32:03] let us know that he went down to the
[1:32:06] region of the lost and he preached to
[1:32:09] souls in prison praise the Lord so even
[1:32:12] though his body was on the cross but his
[1:32:15] Spirit was busy
[1:32:17] now David in the psalm says it like this
[1:32:21] Psalm 24 the Earth is the Lord and the
[1:32:24] fullness thereof the world and there
[1:32:27] that were dead in for he have founded it
[1:32:31] upon the seed and established it upon
[1:32:34] the floor who shall Ascend into the
[1:32:37] hills of the Lord or who shall stand in
[1:32:40] his holy place
[1:32:41] he that have a clean hands and a pure
[1:32:44] heart who have not lifted up his sword
[1:32:48] unto vanities known so deceitfully
[1:32:52] praise the Lord
[1:32:55] he shall receive the blessing from the
[1:32:58] Lord and
[1:33:00] righteousness from the god of his
[1:33:03] salvation this is the generation of them
[1:33:07] that seek him
[1:33:10] there seek their face o Jacob Salem lift
[1:33:14] up your hairs all ye gates and be ye
[1:33:18] lifted up ye Everlasting those and let
[1:33:21] the king of glory
[1:33:23] and the king of glory shall come in who
[1:33:26] is this king of glory the law strong and
[1:33:29] might take the law Almighty in battle
[1:33:33] praise the Lord
[1:33:35] amen
[1:33:37] we know that by scripture and by the
[1:33:40] message of the hour
[1:33:43] under the old Covenant uh uh uh uh
[1:33:47] that's that's where we have Paradox
[1:33:50] Paradise what word the the righteous was
[1:33:52] going but every one of them were somehow
[1:33:55] on the influence of uh or the enemy have
[1:33:59] some some influence on them praise the
[1:34:01] Lord they were pretty much in the same
[1:34:03] ring
[1:34:05] the Bible would let us know about uh
[1:34:08] Hades you know the uh the Old Testament
[1:34:11] talks a lot about that but after Jesus
[1:34:15] died and he resurrected then we realized
[1:34:18] that uh Paradise was now taking over to
[1:34:22] the sixth dimension
[1:34:23] amen
[1:34:25] and uh uh Jesus parable there of Lazarus
[1:34:30] and uh and uh and the rich man and now
[1:34:33] when uh when Lazarus died it shows that
[1:34:38] he went down and he was in a place and
[1:34:41] when a rich man died he was also in a
[1:34:44] place but Jesus said here that uh uh
[1:34:48] there was a gulf between them praise the
[1:34:52] Lord
[1:34:52] there was a gulf between the both places
[1:34:55] now you have to realize now that this
[1:34:58] was before the death of Jesus
[1:35:02] so it was not describing the sixth
[1:35:05] Dimension because the sixth Dimension
[1:35:06] has not come yet
[1:35:10] are we together
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:14] did I throw you over
[1:35:16] did I left you behind
[1:35:19] that the parable that Jesus gave about
[1:35:22] the the the the the
[1:35:25] Lazarus and the rich man it was only to
[1:35:29] describe the region that was existing
[1:35:33] before the Ascension of Jesus
[1:35:39] praise the Lord amen now in that in that
[1:35:43] I think that's Luke chapter 16 if you
[1:35:45] want to look at it in that uh you was
[1:35:47] you realize that Jesus said
[1:35:51] the the rich man said ask Lazarus
[1:35:56] and the only thing that was separating
[1:35:59] the two regions was a gulf
[1:36:03] but he was saying ask Lazarus
[1:36:09] praise the Lord
[1:36:11] are we together
[1:36:13] but after Jesus died
[1:36:16] that was what the Apostle Paul referred
[1:36:19] to here after Jesus died
[1:36:22] he led captivity captives
[1:36:27] so then Paradise
[1:36:31] Lazarus in all the Old Testament sins
[1:36:34] were now move away over to the sixth
[1:36:37] dimension
[1:36:39] are we together
[1:36:46] Jesus parable there was not describing
[1:36:49] the sixth Dimension that's what I wanted
[1:36:51] to
[1:36:52] to
[1:36:55] make us to understand
[1:36:57] nobody was not describing the sixth
[1:36:59] Dimension it was describing before the
[1:37:02] sixth Dimension are we together
[1:37:07] I want to
[1:37:17] mm-hmm
[1:37:22] okay
[1:37:29] now so
[1:37:33] there is there is one more
[1:37:41] let's look also at psalm 68.
[1:37:47] Psalm chapter 68.
[1:38:01] I'm not a teacher I'm just trying to
[1:38:03] build uh
[1:38:06] a background
[1:38:09] to be able to enter our subject amen
[1:38:13] even though I'm not a teacher but by the
[1:38:15] word I I must be able to teach whatever
[1:38:18] is
[1:38:20] we want to hold to in this church as as
[1:38:23] a Doctrine amen
[1:38:37] let's read Verse 18 Psalm 68 18.
[1:38:42] foreign
[1:38:45] they have ascended on high
[1:38:49] there are LED captivity captives
[1:38:53] they all have received gifts for men
[1:38:58] yea for the rebellious also
[1:39:02] that the Lord God my word among them
[1:39:09] praise the Lord
[1:39:11] are we together
[1:39:13] now so uh
[1:39:16] okay
[1:39:18] when when brother Branham preached a
[1:39:20] message the mighty conqueror
[1:39:23] he says the the the the the important of
[1:39:28] the
[1:39:29] the the
[1:39:30] Ascension of Jesus you know the
[1:39:34] importance of his Ascension was to
[1:39:37] create a clear path also the Bible says
[1:39:40] uh uh he overcome he destroyed
[1:39:43] principalities and Power
[1:39:46] praise the Lord he triumphed over
[1:39:49] principalities in power he was so to get
[1:39:52] in the heavens and and just make a clear
[1:39:54] path of every uh uh Supreme spirit
[1:39:59] praise the Lord amen now uh uh Daniel
[1:40:04] let us to know that in a time of Daniel
[1:40:06] Daniel talked about the prince of
[1:40:09] pressure the the head uh uh uh uh Daniel
[1:40:15] respond amen the prince of passion even
[1:40:19] even even stop her uh uh the angel
[1:40:22] Gabriel uh Angel Michael has to come to
[1:40:26] the rescue of Angel Gabriel to get doubt
[1:40:28] their prince of of the power of the air
[1:40:31] now so we realize that that's those are
[1:40:35] spirits that are over every nation amen
[1:40:38] every nation has a spirit every Kingdom
[1:40:42] have a spirit every age has a spirit
[1:40:46] brother Branham said if the Prince of
[1:40:48] Persia held back down in prayer he said
[1:40:51] walk with the prince of laudisha do
[1:40:58] praise the Lord
[1:40:59] amen so we know that uh there is a
[1:41:03] spirit that is influencing the people
[1:41:05] into the Last Day activities
[1:41:12] but you see the Ascension of Jesus
[1:41:15] Christ was to release the believer from
[1:41:19] that influence that's why the Holy Ghost
[1:41:22] is for
[1:41:25] praise the Lord
[1:41:27] that's that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:41:29] giving to the church for
[1:41:32] now so but but this is this is where
[1:41:35] this is where the uh my mind went to for
[1:41:38] reading this to you the Bible says he
[1:41:41] has centered up on hide here David is
[1:41:43] prophesying he led captivity even before
[1:41:46] Jesus died and ascended he he had
[1:41:50] received gifts for men
[1:41:53] yea for the rebellious
[1:41:57] so it is not only people with the Holy
[1:42:01] Ghost that are gifted
[1:42:06] not only people with the Holy Ghost that
[1:42:08] I gifted
[1:42:14] praise the Lord
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:19] we have gifted people
[1:42:21] Alvin even the rebellious
[1:42:27] even their rebellious now so this also
[1:42:32] brings us to the place where it make us
[1:42:34] to to to to to to think and and and and
[1:42:37] realize with the age that we are living
[1:42:40] in remember Jesus said the true spirit
[1:42:43] will be so close that if possible the
[1:42:45] elite will be deceived
[1:42:49] praise the Lord
[1:42:51] so just like how we have uh uh uh A
[1:42:55] Gifted uh uh children of God we also
[1:42:59] have gifted rebellious ones
[1:43:03] and they can use their gift
[1:43:06] and bring chills on your body
[1:43:10] but they are not converted
[1:43:13] now brother Branham will teach us in the
[1:43:15] anointed one at the end time
[1:43:21] how man can have truth anointing
[1:43:28] praise the Lord
[1:43:32] they can have true Godly anointing but
[1:43:35] yet wrong that was one of the first
[1:43:37] thing he stumbled with in his ministry
[1:43:40] when he went to the Pentecostal people
[1:43:42] uh he'd never seen uh uh Gifts of
[1:43:47] tongues and interpretation it was not in
[1:43:49] the Baptist Church when he got upon a
[1:43:51] Pentecostal people he saw the gifts uh
[1:43:54] somebody speaking in tongues another man
[1:43:57] interpreting he says wow this this this
[1:44:00] looks like heaven
[1:44:02] but on a vision he could seize that the
[1:44:05] man I was interpreting was living
[1:44:07] against his marriage vow
[1:44:11] but yet he was interpreting
[1:44:14] and his interpretation was was right to
[1:44:17] the point Barbara and says I'm confused
[1:44:21] he says I'm confused well how how can
[1:44:24] this be I'm seeing on a vision that this
[1:44:27] man have a wife here that he's living
[1:44:29] with another woman
[1:44:34] praise the Lord even though in the early
[1:44:37] part of his ministry God was now starts
[1:44:40] to help him to understand what Paul
[1:44:42] spoke about in The Book of Hebrew
[1:44:44] you know God will start addressing there
[1:44:48] the rain fought upon the just and the
[1:44:49] unjust
[1:44:54] amen
[1:44:55] so you see all of those things brings us
[1:44:57] to the place as children of God
[1:45:00] we have a vocation
[1:45:04] that we must walk worth it off
[1:45:06] and their vocation we cannot just allow
[1:45:10] men
[1:45:12] to lead us wrong
[1:45:16] praise the Lord
[1:45:17] that's the thing that brings us to the
[1:45:19] place where we have to look at these
[1:45:23] things vary very closely
[1:45:29] that's I mean there's we we have a big
[1:45:31] concern uh uh you know some somebody
[1:45:33] said you know when when all the
[1:45:35] musicians fail uh the last bus stop
[1:45:38] where they stop is to sing the name of
[1:45:41] Jesus
[1:45:44] praise the Lord because while they know
[1:45:47] the church is going to buy it
[1:45:49] just put the name of Jesus in the music
[1:45:51] the people who buy it
[1:45:55] praise the Lord
[1:45:57] but you also have to watch the spirit
[1:45:59] that is behind it
[1:46:02] amen
[1:46:04] you have to wash the spirit you have to
[1:46:06] wash the life that is behind these
[1:46:07] people
[1:46:13] it is not because it says Jesus it means
[1:46:16] Jesus
[1:46:19] praise the Lord
[1:46:21] it could say Jesus and spell Jesus and
[1:46:24] make something completely different
[1:46:28] but what I want what I wanted to grab
[1:46:30] your attention on as we are going into
[1:46:32] talking about the gifts and the nature
[1:46:35] of the gifts is this prophecy
[1:46:39] when Paul repeated his prophecy in
[1:46:42] Hebrew he never spoke about the place of
[1:46:45] the rebellious why because he was
[1:46:47] talking to the Church of the redeemed
[1:46:51] he was only going to address the five
[1:46:54] for Ministry
[1:46:57] but he was caught in he was caught in uh
[1:47:00] what David is saying right here
[1:47:03] he gave gifts to men he received gifts
[1:47:07] when Jesus is centered on high that's
[1:47:10] why he told the disciples wait in the
[1:47:12] upper room he went to receive gifts
[1:47:15] to give to man and the Bible said even
[1:47:17] to the rebellious
[1:47:22] that's the reason why we can find people
[1:47:24] they can preach the word
[1:47:27] they can they can bring you to your
[1:47:29] knees
[1:47:31] without the overcoming power
[1:47:40] praise the Lord
[1:47:43] amen so I mean it is it is our
[1:47:47] responsibility our sons and daughters of
[1:47:49] God
[1:47:52] just like it's my responsibility to look
[1:47:55] into the word to step it and then if I'm
[1:47:57] if I'm bringing history to you I want to
[1:48:00] make sure I have the facts I make sure I
[1:48:02] study I make sure I look at those things
[1:48:04] and I know that you know to the best
[1:48:07] that I've gathered together I'm bringing
[1:48:09] I'm bringing truth to you
[1:48:14] praise the Lord
[1:48:17] I know we want to worship I know we want
[1:48:19] to sing I know we want to praise the
[1:48:21] Lord
[1:48:22] but you have your responsibility also to
[1:48:26] look into those things
[1:48:28] take your time look at some of your
[1:48:30] favorite
[1:48:31] gospel musician go back read about their
[1:48:34] lives
[1:48:37] praise the Lord
[1:48:41] because it's a word of entertainment
[1:48:45] you don't need the Holy Ghost to
[1:48:46] entertain
[1:48:48] you don't need the Holy Ghost to
[1:48:50] entertain no you just need a bold face
[1:48:57] either to make people laugh or make
[1:48:59] people cry
[1:49:01] that's the reason why that I mean
[1:49:03] preachers must not be entertainers
[1:49:06] we don't come to entertain you
[1:49:14] but that's the age that we are living in
[1:49:19] that's the age that we are living in
[1:49:22] and if you are not really looking into
[1:49:24] these things
[1:49:26] you could be feeling your spirit with a
[1:49:28] lot of things
[1:49:33] just because equal Jesus does not mean
[1:49:35] there is Jesus
[1:49:38] right
[1:49:45] are we together I just wanted to drop
[1:49:47] this in here so uh uh uh we we can be
[1:49:52] together
[1:49:53] it's a scripture that has been very
[1:49:56] outstanding to my mind every time I look
[1:49:58] at it he received gifts for the
[1:50:01] rebellious also that the Lord my word
[1:50:05] among them praise the Lord are we
[1:50:08] together back to Ephesians chapter four
[1:50:13] amen
[1:50:14] are we together
[1:50:16] we are back to Ephesians chapter four
[1:50:23] verse 8 wherefore
[1:50:25] when he has centered upon high he led
[1:50:28] captivity captives and give gifts to men
[1:50:31] Paul was quoting psalm 68.
[1:50:37] now that he has centered what is it but
[1:50:41] that
[1:50:42] he also descended first into the lower
[1:50:45] parts of the earth he went down to the
[1:50:48] region of the Lost
[1:50:50] praise the Lord
[1:50:52] he went down to the region of the lost
[1:50:54] brother Branham which says he kicked the
[1:50:56] door he took the keys of of death from
[1:50:59] the hands of Satan amen he went down to
[1:51:02] the lowest part of the Earth
[1:51:05] this is the law that is strong and
[1:51:07] mighty in battle
[1:51:09] amen so I mean there is no there is no
[1:51:13] law place that you can get to that God
[1:51:15] cannot reach down to amen if he went
[1:51:17] down to the lowest part of the earth he
[1:51:19] can come and pick you up from wherever
[1:51:21] you are
[1:51:22] amen now that he extended what is it
[1:51:27] about that he also descended first to
[1:51:29] the lower part of the earth he that
[1:51:31] descended is the same also that extended
[1:51:34] up far above all Heavens that he might
[1:51:37] fill all things
[1:51:41] praise the Lord
[1:51:43] and he gave some apostle
[1:51:48] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:51:53] and some pastors and some teachers
[1:51:58] for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:52:02] for the working of the ministry
[1:52:07] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:52:10] amen
[1:52:12] these gifts are given for the perfecting
[1:52:16] of the Saints for the working of the
[1:52:20] ministry now what Ministry is that is
[1:52:23] the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:52:26] are we together that Ministry is the
[1:52:29] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:52:31] uh you know I sit there to say that
[1:52:35] there is just only one Ministry just
[1:52:38] like Paul says there is one Faith one
[1:52:41] baptism amen
[1:52:44] and and one Spirit you know one hope
[1:52:49] so there is only one Ministry and that
[1:52:52] Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:52:56] and all of these uh uh uh Ministries
[1:52:59] here all of these uh uh gifts that I
[1:53:02] give in to to this man that we want to
[1:53:05] address this morning and they all come
[1:53:08] honor that Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:53:11] praise the Lord I would just I will open
[1:53:13] a little a little parenthesis here for
[1:53:16] you I've seen many times you find people
[1:53:20] in church
[1:53:22] and uh maybe they are ministers and or
[1:53:26] different things you know I mean you you
[1:53:28] see that a lot in the churches out there
[1:53:31] you know uh someone has a Praying
[1:53:33] Ministry and someone has a you know uh a
[1:53:37] giving Ministry and someone has a you
[1:53:39] know all of those different things as
[1:53:41] wonderful as they are you know uh uh in
[1:53:45] in the same body we can never have
[1:53:48] individual Ministry it does not work
[1:53:51] like that
[1:53:53] no
[1:53:56] whatever Ministry that God gives it must
[1:53:59] be a body Ministry
[1:54:02] and it must all come under one hand the
[1:54:06] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:54:10] the Lord
[1:54:13] amen
[1:54:14] you'll find people that are missionaries
[1:54:16] and and we talk about that too as we go
[1:54:18] on I realize I'm losing my time here but
[1:54:21] you'll find that and then uh uh
[1:54:24] prednisone they are running an
[1:54:26] individual Ministry
[1:54:31] I goes to that church but I have my
[1:54:33] Ministry it does not work like that
[1:54:36] no it does not work like that
[1:54:39] if your ministry is not good enough to
[1:54:42] be subject to the local church
[1:54:45] then it's better you just be on your own
[1:54:52] praise the Lord
[1:54:57] because I mean there are a lot of things
[1:54:59] that we can we can share also there uh
[1:55:02] uh in that in their sense
[1:55:05] and uh
[1:55:07] uh yeah in that sense but just just to
[1:55:10] be able to help you you know to you know
[1:55:14] to to uh to for us to be able to just
[1:55:18] just grab a mentor picture in our mind
[1:55:20] there is just one Ministry and that's
[1:55:22] the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:55:24] praise the Lord
[1:55:26] so these gifts are giving for the
[1:55:29] Perfection of the sins for the working
[1:55:31] of the ministry and for the edifying of
[1:55:34] the Body for the edifying of the body
[1:55:38] that's what we must do we must edify one
[1:55:41] another we must encourage one another
[1:55:43] Paul said in Hebrew we must provoke one
[1:55:46] another amen that's what the gift is
[1:55:50] giving for if you have any gifts in you
[1:55:52] it must be there to edify they must be
[1:55:56] there to encourage people to provoke
[1:55:58] people to get closer to God
[1:56:01] the the gifts are not given as a remote
[1:56:05] control
[1:56:08] praise the Lord
[1:56:10] we have to download your daily life and
[1:56:13] then control you what you have to do and
[1:56:15] what the gifts are not giving for that
[1:56:20] praise the Lord
[1:56:22] amen
[1:56:24] if there is anything wrong the gifts
[1:56:26] must correct because the word corrects
[1:56:28] the error
[1:56:29] that gives is giving to clean the church
[1:56:33] praise the Lord
[1:56:34] and then also that we cannot subject
[1:56:37] ourselves to the correction of the give
[1:56:39] then there is a problem also
[1:56:41] because it's not just to just pet you on
[1:56:44] your back and encourage what you are
[1:56:46] doing no
[1:56:48] it is there for the edifying of the
[1:56:50] Saints and
[1:56:52] it is also therefore
[1:56:55] the perfecting of the sins the edifying
[1:56:58] of the body of Jesus Christ till we all
[1:57:00] come
[1:57:01] to the unity of the faith
[1:57:05] yes amen
[1:57:06] until we come to the unity so you see we
[1:57:09] must strive for the unity of the spirit
[1:57:10] until we can come to the unity of the
[1:57:13] faith
[1:57:16] praise the Lord
[1:57:18] we must strive for the unity of the
[1:57:21] spirit we must strive to to keep an
[1:57:24] atmosphere in this place
[1:57:27] we must leave our attitudes outside
[1:57:33] praise the Lord
[1:57:36] everything would just not be pleasing to
[1:57:38] you
[1:57:41] but you must also ask is a pleasing to
[1:57:43] God when it's not pleasing to God in
[1:57:46] your mind that's when you should have
[1:57:48] problem with it
[1:57:51] when I think that what is being done yet
[1:57:53] is now pleasing to God I must have
[1:57:55] serious problem with it
[1:57:58] then come and show us that I don't think
[1:58:01] this thing is pleasing to God because in
[1:58:03] the word I see it this way
[1:58:06] it must not be about being pleased into
[1:58:08] any individual
[1:58:11] because if we want to please everybody
[1:58:12] we will end up pleasing nobody
[1:58:16] one person we want to be pleased is the
[1:58:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:24] are we together
[1:58:27] amen
[1:58:30] are we together
[1:58:34] can I stop preaching
[1:58:39] because I really have not started yet
[1:58:46] now let's uh let's let's go to Genesis
[1:58:49] chapter 3.
[1:58:51] if I'm really trying to take my time I
[1:58:54] don't want to be I don't want to be
[1:58:55] caught up in my flesh this morning
[1:58:58] I'm trying to slow my emotional wheels
[1:59:01] down
[1:59:03] Genesis chapter 3
[1:59:12] .
[1:59:16] foreign
[1:59:19] verse 23 therefore the Lord God sent him
[1:59:24] send him Adam him from the Garden of
[1:59:28] Eden to tell the ground from whence he
[1:59:31] was taken so he drove out the man Adam
[1:59:35] and he placed at the east of the
[1:59:39] Guardian
[1:59:40] of eating cherubins
[1:59:43] with flaming salts
[1:59:46] which
[1:59:48] turn every way
[1:59:52] to keep the way of the Tree of Life
[1:59:57] praise the Lord
[1:59:58] So Adam fell we know the story God came
[2:00:03] down and and and then he gave adam
[2:00:06] a cloth of skin to dress
[2:00:11] but what he what is he going to do now
[2:00:13] is that he's going now to protect this
[2:00:16] street of life because Adam is now in a
[2:00:19] falling State he's no longer having a
[2:00:22] right to the Tree of Life God is now
[2:00:25] going to protect the treat of life with
[2:00:27] cherubims
[2:00:29] now this this will be about the first
[2:00:32] time turbines are used in the scripture
[2:00:36] cherubings so yeah cherubins are placed
[2:00:40] with flaming sauce
[2:00:43] Cherry beans a place where flaming Souls
[2:00:47] praise the Lord
[2:00:50] are we together
[2:00:52] cherubins are placed with flaming Souls
[2:00:57] now so uh uh let's let's just stop in
[2:01:01] their mindset so we can be able to to
[2:01:05] gather some things here also
[2:01:08] praise the Lord
[2:01:13] and uh
[2:01:17] let's take Psalm 104 Psalm 104
[2:01:26] Psalm 104
[2:01:29] . sorry if you if you love the emotion
[2:01:32] of a Preacher I'm not emotional this
[2:01:34] morning
[2:01:49] I want to lay all of these things down
[2:01:51] then I can start to preach Psalm 104 the
[2:01:54] Bible says here let's go directly to
[2:01:57] verse 4 who maketh his angels spirits
[2:02:03] his minister
[2:02:05] uh flaming
[2:02:07] fire
[2:02:10] praise the Lord
[2:02:12] amen
[2:02:14] now you will see that uh
[2:02:19] uh
[2:02:25] uh now what what what what I want to
[2:02:28] establish with this is that over in the
[2:02:32] in the in Genesis we saw God putting
[2:02:36] cherubins to guide the treat of life and
[2:02:40] the Bible says they were giving
[2:02:43] flaming Souls amen
[2:02:45] now David here on the inspiration picked
[2:02:50] this up because Paul is going to talk
[2:02:52] about it in Hebrew so I want for us to
[2:02:54] see it here before we travel there to
[2:02:56] Hebrew
[2:02:57] praise the Lord so David year now he's
[2:03:01] going to pick this up now see the way
[2:03:04] that David said it he says who make it
[2:03:06] his angels Spirits his Minister a
[2:03:11] flaming fire
[2:03:13] praise the Lord
[2:03:15] now what we want to talk about is the
[2:03:18] nature of the ministry
[2:03:20] in in Genesis we're seeing God put in
[2:03:24] cherubins to protect the way to the
[2:03:27] treat of life
[2:03:29] praise the Lord
[2:03:31] and these cherubimes are angels
[2:03:36] praise the Lord amen so what David is
[2:03:40] dealing with here is that David is going
[2:03:43] he's he's showing us in the same sense
[2:03:46] that the spirit that is on these angels
[2:03:49] are the same spirits that are on
[2:03:51] ministers
[2:03:56] praise the Lord
[2:03:58] are you are you are you seeing that
[2:04:01] who make his angels
[2:04:05] spirits
[2:04:07] his ministers
[2:04:10] flames of fire
[2:04:12] there in Genesis they were giving they
[2:04:14] were giving uh Fleming swords to guide
[2:04:18] the way to the treat of life
[2:04:21] are we together
[2:04:23] amen
[2:04:24] I want I want us to to to uh to be able
[2:04:28] to uh uh uh uh to picture that
[2:04:33] are you with me
[2:04:36] okay now so
[2:04:39] uh
[2:04:41] let's take
[2:04:43] uh
[2:04:45] Ezekiel chapter one if you read Ezekiel
[2:04:48] chapter one if I just if I just take
[2:04:50] everything one at a time we will we will
[2:04:53] we will just be completely out of time
[2:04:55] but if you read Ezekiel chapter 1 and
[2:04:58] Ezekiel chapter 10 you will find that
[2:05:01] word the cherubims at this tribe
[2:05:05] they have they have four phases
[2:05:09] they had the face of of a man the face
[2:05:13] of an ego the face of a lion and the
[2:05:16] face of an ox they have four faces so so
[2:05:20] their uh uh uh uh Ezekiel speaks of it
[2:05:27] praise the Lord
[2:05:28] and then also in uh Ezekiel chapter 10
[2:05:32] he talks about those uh uh uh
[2:05:38] uh cherubins
[2:05:40] in
[2:05:42] Revelation chapter 5
[2:05:46] John who identified the same cherubins
[2:05:50] around the throne
[2:05:55] praise the Lord
[2:05:57] and and he will call them living
[2:05:59] creatures
[2:06:02] are we together
[2:06:04] he will now call the same cherubims
[2:06:08] around the throne
[2:06:10] that is that Ezekiel sawed he will call
[2:06:14] them year living creatures
[2:06:16] and then when they are identify they are
[2:06:20] also identified the same as an ego a
[2:06:25] lion an ox and a man
[2:06:29] praise the Lord so if God made his Angel
[2:06:33] spirits
[2:06:34] and his Minister uh flames of fire then
[2:06:38] we realize that it is the same spirit
[2:06:41] that has upon these living creatures
[2:06:44] God is now going to give
[2:06:48] as an anointing
[2:06:51] to guide his word to protect his word
[2:06:55] among his people
[2:06:58] he gave gifts
[2:07:01] so he's going to bring that same Spirit
[2:07:04] now because realize now that uh on the
[2:07:08] days of Pentecost God is going to come
[2:07:11] down
[2:07:12] endured among his people
[2:07:17] praise the Lord
[2:07:20] amen so as he's coming down to do it
[2:07:24] among his people he's bringing the
[2:07:27] anointing he's breaking the spirit of
[2:07:29] the living creatures
[2:07:31] to protect his presence
[2:07:35] to protect his word
[2:07:40] it's not going to be cherubims in the
[2:07:43] New Testament Church but these Spirits
[2:07:45] are going to come upon men
[2:07:53] are we together why because David
[2:07:56] prophesied about it
[2:07:59] he make his Angel spirits and his
[2:08:02] ministers flame of fire is is just that
[2:08:05] it's it's a it's a spirit that minister
[2:08:09] it's not the man that minister is the
[2:08:12] spirit is the gift it comes true that
[2:08:15] China a minister to you
[2:08:19] and all I have to do is to guide the way
[2:08:22] to the Tree of Life
[2:08:26] so now we we have we have identified
[2:08:30] that these Ministries that Paul is
[2:08:33] talking about here over inefficient form
[2:08:36] he gives us
[2:08:39] some are giving apostles
[2:08:43] praise the Lord
[2:08:45] some prophets some evangelists
[2:08:49] some pastors and some teachers
[2:08:53] praise the Lord now there are five
[2:08:56] Ministries
[2:08:58] but yeah when we look at the living
[2:09:00] creatures they are full
[2:09:06] praise the Lord
[2:09:07] amen now before many years back
[2:09:13] I thought it was
[2:09:15] a five-fold in a sense like uh five four
[2:09:19] that's that's the way I used to think in
[2:09:21] my mind five full ministry
[2:09:24] why because it was five Ministry for
[2:09:26] anointing
[2:09:28] so I thought it was fivefold
[2:09:31] no but it's five-fold
[2:09:34] five that are working under the same
[2:09:37] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:09:39] so don't go go from here saying
[2:09:42] five-fold don't be like me
[2:09:44] praise the Lord
[2:09:47] amen
[2:09:48] now so we have five Ministries we have
[2:09:52] four anointing
[2:09:57] are we together
[2:10:09] we have just read
[2:10:12] where brother Branham is identifying
[2:10:15] that the man
[2:10:18] praise the Lord
[2:10:21] he says yet again I read that from
[2:10:23] Christ it's revealed in his own word God
[2:10:26] has selected the man for the age he has
[2:10:28] selected the message and even the nature
[2:10:32] of the man and what he will go over in
[2:10:35] that age
[2:10:37] what he could put over how he could wave
[2:10:40] the nature of that setting man
[2:10:45] praise the Lord
[2:10:48] so here is God having
[2:10:54] fall
[2:10:56] nature
[2:10:57] one is a nature of an ego
[2:11:02] the other one is the nature of our
[2:11:07] a lion
[2:11:10] and he has uh uh the representation of
[2:11:14] an ox
[2:11:15] and he also represented man
[2:11:18] among the living creatures around his
[2:11:21] throne
[2:11:22] praise the Lord
[2:11:24] amen
[2:11:25] now so bring in those gifts
[2:11:29] to give gifts to man
[2:11:33] he's going to find man that he have
[2:11:36] called that he have predestinated
[2:11:39] and he's going to give them now we are
[2:11:43] born with our nature we are born in our
[2:11:46] Natural Life
[2:11:47] praise the Lord
[2:11:49] but uh uh uh you know just like the way
[2:11:52] Paul said to the Corinthians
[2:11:55] the gift of the Prophet is subject to
[2:11:58] the prophet
[2:12:00] amen it is it gives us the saints that
[2:12:04] when God gives a man a gift a do not go
[2:12:08] contrary to your nature
[2:12:12] it don't go contrary to your nature
[2:12:17] it has to go in line with your nature
[2:12:24] are we together
[2:12:28] so I'm still laying Foundation
[2:12:33] so we see here that we have five
[2:12:39] Ministry and we have five full anointing
[2:12:44] praise the Lord
[2:12:47] amen
[2:12:48] I will I will get into this and then I
[2:12:51] will read some few things here to you
[2:12:53] just to be able to to uh place it back
[2:12:57] in the message and and uh uh find a
[2:13:01] place to close here now so we see here
[2:13:04] that Paul says
[2:13:08] so Psalm was giving apostles
[2:13:12] now apostles
[2:13:15] is the is the first
[2:13:17] uh uh Ministry
[2:13:21] and in all true Paul letter he
[2:13:23] identified there as the first you go in
[2:13:25] the book of Corinthians he said first he
[2:13:27] gives some Apostle he used that word
[2:13:29] first he gave some Apostles so apostles
[2:13:33] were the kind of for first first gift
[2:13:35] that was identified
[2:13:38] and it all comes from uh
[2:13:41] uh Jesus sending out the disciples after
[2:13:46] they've been taught
[2:13:48] praise the Lord
[2:13:50] amen the Bible call him the Apostle of
[2:13:54] our profession he was sent by God
[2:13:58] Apostle is one that is sin
[2:14:02] praise the Lord
[2:14:03] amen one that is sent so that's how he
[2:14:07] become the Apostle of our profession
[2:14:11] which means also our confession
[2:14:14] praise the Lord so we put him to work
[2:14:17] when we confess our needs
[2:14:20] then he can go to the father and
[2:14:22] intercede for us
[2:14:24] he can work on our behalf he's the
[2:14:27] Apostle of our profession
[2:14:29] praise the Lord but first Psalm was
[2:14:33] giving Apostles Apostles are the the
[2:14:36] ones that were sent brother Branham says
[2:14:39] is generally used as missionaries
[2:14:42] praise the Lord
[2:14:43] but even the pastor can be missionary
[2:14:46] amen someone going out for a particular
[2:14:50] Mission but when you come under this uh
[2:14:54] uh uh work of the ministry
[2:15:00] this gift in the faithful
[2:15:06] the ones that go out and establish
[2:15:10] churches
[2:15:11] establish work establish people in the
[2:15:15] faith
[2:15:18] that's their work
[2:15:21] praise the Lord
[2:15:24] amen
[2:15:29] that is their work
[2:15:31] so after that we have
[2:15:34] their prophets some Prophets
[2:15:38] praise the Lord
[2:15:40] so we have the we have the
[2:15:44] the
[2:15:47] the ego
[2:15:49] amen
[2:15:50] and we have the The Lion Okay the some
[2:15:54] giving uh Apostles uh the apostles will
[2:15:58] come under the anointing of the Lion
[2:16:05] praise the Lord
[2:16:06] they will come on the their the
[2:16:09] anointing of the lion is because this
[2:16:12] man
[2:16:12] they are they are men they are that uh
[2:16:16] that are bold
[2:16:19] amen they are established you see the
[2:16:22] Apostle Paul he could go into a place I
[2:16:26] mean even if it will cause his life they
[2:16:28] were they are men that are born they
[2:16:30] have the nature to be born
[2:16:34] many times people would think is the
[2:16:36] Evangelist no it's not an evangelist
[2:16:41] is the apostle
[2:16:43] they are men they are bored they goes in
[2:16:46] to region they are able to confront
[2:16:48] false Doctrine because they have the
[2:16:51] word amen they are able to confront
[2:16:54] false Spirit that's the reason why Paul
[2:16:56] could deal with the things in the
[2:16:58] Corinthian Church
[2:17:00] he says a man sleeping with his
[2:17:02] father-in-law his mother and as
[2:17:04] communicate him
[2:17:08] he could deal with those things
[2:17:12] the nature of the Apostle is a bold
[2:17:16] nature they are not coming just with dry
[2:17:20] face they are coming with the principle
[2:17:22] of the word
[2:17:24] they can be able to run you from uh
[2:17:27] Genesis to Revelation and say this thing
[2:17:30] is not in the word
[2:17:33] as chapter 15 when some men started
[2:17:37] creating a Doctrine word they wanted to
[2:17:39] force the Gentiles to be circumcised
[2:17:41] they call the apostles
[2:17:44] come together let's talk about this
[2:17:46] let's look at it in the word
[2:17:50] so you see God gives men that has a a
[2:17:54] gift to be able to confront
[2:18:00] false Doctrine
[2:18:02] false teaching false Spirit false
[2:18:04] manifestation of gifts in the church
[2:18:08] they can confront it
[2:18:12] we are not doubting your gift but your
[2:18:14] gift must come in order
[2:18:20] are we together
[2:18:22] now so the next one is that he gave some
[2:18:27] Prophets
[2:18:30] praise the Lord
[2:18:32] and some evangelists the evangelists and
[2:18:36] the prophet comes under the same nature
[2:18:39] they are people of High inspiration
[2:18:42] the evangelists can come behind the
[2:18:44] pulpit he prayed and he just go
[2:18:48] he just go
[2:18:51] he's he's uh he's burning he's burden
[2:18:54] now to be able to just to just attack
[2:18:56] any evil and condemn sinning and you
[2:18:59] know and bring the people back to the
[2:19:01] word he's honored that
[2:19:04] so the prophet and evangelists share the
[2:19:08] same nature they are people that can
[2:19:10] rise High under their anointing
[2:19:14] no they are the Apostle in the otherwise
[2:19:17] he's a solid man
[2:19:19] histolic
[2:19:21] he comes and he laying the word down to
[2:19:24] you just like this just he just laying
[2:19:26] the word down
[2:19:28] but the the the the Prophet by vision
[2:19:33] he can he can go high into uh uh uh
[2:19:37] inspiration
[2:19:40] praise the Lord amen now you will see
[2:19:44] that
[2:19:45] Paul the Apostle
[2:19:48] you will also realize that he was a
[2:19:52] prophet
[2:19:54] amen
[2:19:55] he was a prophet so he had a dual
[2:19:59] Ministry
[2:20:01] he was a prophet because the word of the
[2:20:05] Old Testament New Testament was given to
[2:20:08] him
[2:20:10] he had the word
[2:20:12] he could be able to balance the Shadow
[2:20:14] and the Fulfillment of The Shadow
[2:20:18] we see right here he took a scripture in
[2:20:21] psalm
[2:20:22] to be able to address the fight for
[2:20:25] Ministry how he ascended so that's he
[2:20:28] that's he was a prophet
[2:20:31] are we together
[2:20:33] but he was also an apostle
[2:20:37] praise the Lord
[2:20:39] amen we will find out that in the seven
[2:20:42] Church ages the age began with a prophet
[2:20:45] and it ends with a prophet
[2:20:50] praise the Lord
[2:20:52] amen
[2:20:53] and when brother Branham came that's the
[2:20:56] reason why Brother Band said he says I
[2:20:58] was never a successful Pastor why
[2:21:01] because he had a gift of an evangelist
[2:21:04] and a prophet
[2:21:09] praise the Lord that's the reason why he
[2:21:13] could preach the way he was he he
[2:21:14] preached you know he was he was he was
[2:21:17] he was very strong on certain things in
[2:21:19] rebuking immoralities and calling things
[2:21:22] out and all of that that was just his
[2:21:24] nature
[2:21:28] are we together
[2:21:33] praise the Lord
[2:21:35] so the prophet and the evangelists
[2:21:39] operates under the ego's anointing they
[2:21:42] are people of High inspiration
[2:21:48] are we together
[2:21:50] and then some he gave pastors
[2:21:53] the pastor is honor
[2:21:56] the ox anointing
[2:21:58] he's the bedding Bearer
[2:22:02] amen
[2:22:03] he's the bed and Bearer
[2:22:06] and the teacher is honor immense
[2:22:09] anointing
[2:22:11] are we together
[2:22:15] so we have the four phases of the
[2:22:19] cherubim
[2:22:21] The Lion The Eagle
[2:22:24] the ox and the man those four faces
[2:22:26] those four anointing God gave it as a
[2:22:30] gift to his church to be able to protect
[2:22:33] his presence his word in the local
[2:22:36] church
[2:22:43] are we together
[2:22:44] amen now when we go back to Psalm to
[2:22:49] realize that the Bible says he give
[2:22:51] gifts to man even to the rebellious
[2:22:54] the word that said brings us a people
[2:22:58] that is redeemed you see that's the
[2:23:00] reason why in the church ages they were
[2:23:03] able to find those men that call
[2:23:04] themselves Jews and they were not why
[2:23:06] because they were taught in the word
[2:23:08] they were not just cared about emotions
[2:23:11] they were looking at a man and they were
[2:23:13] bringing him back to the word no matter
[2:23:15] what he says
[2:23:17] he can say I used to be with Paul I
[2:23:19] slept with Paul they would bring
[2:23:21] everything you said back to the word
[2:23:27] praise the Lord why because they knew
[2:23:29] that yeah they were there were men that
[2:23:32] were gifted but also they are rebellious
[2:23:34] spirit
[2:23:36] now this will go back to our old
[2:23:39] testament uh time Saul Saul was anointed
[2:23:42] to be king
[2:23:45] praise the Lord the Bible says Saul was
[2:23:49] numbered among the prophets and
[2:23:50] inspiration came on in he shouted he got
[2:23:53] excited by the end he had a spirit of
[2:23:56] rebellion he could no longer be subject
[2:23:59] toward the word of Samir
[2:24:02] he was only doing what he thought was
[2:24:04] right in his mind he didn't care it did
[2:24:07] not bother him he wanted to he wanted to
[2:24:10] you know
[2:24:12] we've been looking in the uh reading the
[2:24:14] book of of Samia there so it just bring
[2:24:17] the picture right to my mind I was just
[2:24:19] thinking about it that day Saul was was
[2:24:22] was raised up
[2:24:23] as a captain he was anointed
[2:24:27] to defend Israel against the Philistines
[2:24:32] when Saul got so bad under his anointing
[2:24:36] he left the Philistine he started
[2:24:38] fighting his own
[2:24:41] he wanted to kill his son Jonathan from
[2:24:43] being on David's side he started running
[2:24:46] after the elite you are you are raised
[2:24:48] up to fight against the enemy why fight
[2:24:50] against the people you are called to
[2:24:52] lead
[2:24:56] praise the Lord
[2:25:03] when we have issues
[2:25:05] we deal with him
[2:25:07] praise the Lord and we must deal with
[2:25:10] them according to the word
[2:25:12] Hallelujah
[2:25:14] and when we deal with it according to
[2:25:16] the word we must place it under the
[2:25:18] blood they don't become our personal
[2:25:21] issues
[2:25:22] when we start attacking one another and
[2:25:25] campaigning against one another those
[2:25:27] things are not done in a Church of the
[2:25:28] Living God
[2:25:35] you can meet men and then we sit down
[2:25:37] tell me your displeasure and I mean if
[2:25:39] our offend you assist our brother says
[2:25:41] I'm very sorry I'm sorry that I did that
[2:25:43] praise the Lord it will be another thing
[2:25:46] if I make a sermon out of it and come
[2:25:48] behind the pooping and start attacking
[2:25:49] you
[2:25:55] praise the Lord
[2:25:57] so you see the the the the the the holy
[2:26:00] spirit is trying to guide us about these
[2:26:03] things
[2:26:05] that's the reason why he wants us to
[2:26:09] identify the nature of the ministry
[2:26:17] praise the Lord
[2:26:19] are we together
[2:26:22] if you have questions you can add it to
[2:26:24] your questions
[2:26:29] so you see that's that's the fight for
[2:26:31] this that's all preacher that makes
[2:26:32] makes this thing beautiful one time
[2:26:35] he says
[2:26:37] you know like just like Brett Brown said
[2:26:39] he says those those five families
[2:26:41] Traders God dress word
[2:26:42] he says see how beautiful it is it is
[2:26:45] just like the five fingers and you can
[2:26:48] you can place it right here
[2:26:50] I struggle over it during the week but I
[2:26:52] got it
[2:26:53] praise the Lord
[2:26:55] amen this is the apostle
[2:26:59] you have to realize that uh in the fight
[2:27:01] for Ministry in the five foot Ministry
[2:27:05] the apostle
[2:27:07] is uh uh is the highest office let me
[2:27:11] say it that way why why I say it that
[2:27:13] way because
[2:27:14] Jesus begin with the apostles
[2:27:17] amen and he is also called The Apostles
[2:27:21] of
[2:27:22] our profession
[2:27:25] now there are just no one Ministry above
[2:27:28] another
[2:27:29] but if you want to keep it in
[2:27:32] chronological order
[2:27:34] amen
[2:27:36] before there were pastors placed in
[2:27:38] local church Apostles went there to
[2:27:41] start the work let me make it that
[2:27:43] simple amen so the Apostle
[2:27:46] you know uh uh have the have the uh
[2:27:53] how did I call it I said it right just
[2:27:55] now
[2:27:57] amen
[2:27:59] now so the apostles they they are the
[2:28:02] one there that are in chronological
[2:28:03] other and uh uh but when it comes to a
[2:28:08] local church
[2:28:09] the pastor is the Adam
[2:28:15] when it comes to the ministry the
[2:28:18] apostle
[2:28:20] is the other
[2:28:22] but when it comes to the local church
[2:28:24] the pastor is the Adam
[2:28:28] every other Ministry comes on
[2:28:32] praise the Lord
[2:28:35] amen
[2:28:39] you see that in the life of brother
[2:28:41] Branham he never went over to people
[2:28:43] churches and started telling them don't
[2:28:45] you know I'm the prophet of the age
[2:28:47] and all he respected what the people did
[2:28:50] because in the local church the pastor
[2:28:52] is the Adam
[2:28:58] praise the Lord
[2:29:00] take for example even if we had an
[2:29:02] apostle that came over here to to to
[2:29:05] Brooklyn Center and started this church
[2:29:07] and he's the Apostle of the church he
[2:29:09] started the church now the church has
[2:29:12] voted his pastor
[2:29:13] that apostle
[2:29:16] the pastor become the Elder of the
[2:29:19] apostle
[2:29:24] are we together I just wanted to drop
[2:29:27] that little one in so yeah I was telling
[2:29:29] you about about this now now the the
[2:29:32] pointy finger is the evangelist
[2:29:37] praise the Lord
[2:29:38] the pointy finger is the Evangelist he
[2:29:40] said he will tell you right to your face
[2:29:42] you better be born again amen the
[2:29:45] Evangelist will tell you right to your
[2:29:47] face you must repent have you been
[2:29:48] baptized he would knock his finger on
[2:29:50] your face
[2:29:51] he's anointed that way now the the the
[2:29:55] the middle finger is the prophet he
[2:29:58] balance
[2:30:00] he oversees
[2:30:03] praise the Lord
[2:30:04] amen and he's he's the tallest singer
[2:30:07] too
[2:30:09] you know that this is the pastor finger
[2:30:13] because he does the wedding
[2:30:17] he's the marriage finger
[2:30:19] I'm I'm taking this from uh brother
[2:30:21] Harry Beckett over in South Africa he
[2:30:25] says you see the fight for ministry
[2:30:26] right there he says uh he said this is
[2:30:29] the teacher he gets in area where other
[2:30:31] fingers can get
[2:30:35] line
[2:30:40] praise the Lord
[2:30:42] he walks on teen line
[2:30:46] so God designed it that way
[2:30:50] God designed it that way brother banham
[2:30:52] says here Revelation the book of symbol
[2:30:55] he said Paul said
[2:30:58] I am a prisoner of the Lord Jesus but he
[2:31:02] said I magnify my office in the Lord
[2:31:06] how the love of God constrained him to
[2:31:10] go among the unclean gentiles
[2:31:13] who were considered dogs
[2:31:16] but Paul said I magnify my office now so
[2:31:21] so what is that what what is that that
[2:31:23] brother Brandon is driving to to see us
[2:31:25] here you know because it was his office
[2:31:29] Peter Peter was uncomfortable
[2:31:32] with the Gentiles but Paul he could go
[2:31:36] there to them
[2:31:38] he magnified his office
[2:31:42] are we together so that that is the
[2:31:45] understanding that brother Branham is
[2:31:46] trying to bring to us here he says that
[2:31:49] Paul said a magnify my office because
[2:31:52] he's giving me the the opportunity to go
[2:31:56] Minister told the dogs otherwise the
[2:31:59] Gentiles he's just using that
[2:32:01] amen
[2:32:03] why Peter was struggling to be accepted
[2:32:06] Paul never struggled
[2:32:08] in nature makes him to step in the
[2:32:11] circumstances
[2:32:13] he was called to do that
[2:32:17] right praise the Lord
[2:32:19] he was called to do it
[2:32:24] one brother said he said they're so
[2:32:27] beautifully
[2:32:29] I can't remember which one of them now
[2:32:31] but he said it this way he says uh uh
[2:32:34] many other times we are looking for our
[2:32:36] gifts and our calling or our gifts in
[2:32:39] the body
[2:32:40] he said you have to realize that you are
[2:32:42] born with your gift
[2:32:44] the Holy Ghost only come and activate it
[2:32:49] your gifts are the things that you do
[2:32:52] and then you don't feel embarrassed
[2:32:54] about it
[2:32:55] right it just flowed naturally you enjoy
[2:32:58] doing it
[2:33:01] if you are doing something you have to
[2:33:03] look over your shoulder whether you are
[2:33:05] looking for a man to see you or you want
[2:33:06] to be I please her or you are
[2:33:09] embarrassed about it it's not a gift
[2:33:12] you are you are just doing it it's good
[2:33:14] that you are doing it
[2:33:18] but if it is your gift you get right in
[2:33:20] there you you don't you don't think
[2:33:22] twice about it
[2:33:25] because it's part of you
[2:33:28] give and calling out with our repentance
[2:33:30] that's what the scripture says so it's
[2:33:32] in you
[2:33:37] most of the time we we we wanted to we
[2:33:40] want an angel to come and tell us
[2:33:43] we want an angel to blow the trumpet and
[2:33:45] says my son this is your gift but it's
[2:33:47] right there in you
[2:33:50] the things that you love to do for the
[2:33:53] Lord
[2:33:54] with nobody telling you you enjoy it not
[2:33:58] the things that you love to do to make
[2:34:00] yourself sane or you love to do what I I
[2:34:03] mean to talk to uh to get something or
[2:34:06] another but it flows because it's part
[2:34:08] of you
[2:34:11] the more you the more you get in love
[2:34:13] with God and you live a consecrated life
[2:34:16] it just flow out of you
[2:34:19] praise the Lord
[2:34:22] some people they don't think twice so
[2:34:24] even as as you know tell somebody about
[2:34:26] Jesus or tell somebody that they are a
[2:34:28] Christian they don't have to think twice
[2:34:30] it just come out of them
[2:34:34] but when you have to start calculating
[2:34:37] and start thinking which Bible verse
[2:34:39] just leave it
[2:34:41] just forget about it alleviate
[2:34:44] because you make a mess
[2:34:50] well that is just parenthesis Paul says
[2:34:52] I magnify my office
[2:34:57] amen now you'll find the same thing
[2:35:00] there over in the book of uh uh Joshua
[2:35:03] the Bible says the law magnified Joshua
[2:35:06] before the people
[2:35:08] the people have just come from honor
[2:35:10] Moses Ministry word they have seen the
[2:35:13] supernatural the supernatural now God
[2:35:16] will do something in the ministry of
[2:35:18] Joshua to wean the people heart
[2:35:23] so they will not be comparing Joshua to
[2:35:27] Moses and you find that many times
[2:35:29] people come from on a certain Ministry
[2:35:32] and they move to a certain place
[2:35:34] it's not about I think I mean they they
[2:35:37] have so enjoyed that Ministry they like
[2:35:39] the way things done and pretty soon the
[2:35:41] human nature put you to the place where
[2:35:43] you start comparing
[2:35:45] praise the Lord
[2:35:50] sometimes it's a good thing sometimes
[2:35:52] it's a bad thing
[2:35:54] because if you get stuck in that you
[2:35:57] will never see what God is doing in that
[2:36:00] local place you will be in this place
[2:36:02] and then you'll be having church
[2:36:04] somewhere else
[2:36:05] because that's what you are used to all
[2:36:07] the time
[2:36:09] but what will happen sometimes is that
[2:36:12] God will use the local Ministry to do
[2:36:16] something where he can just grab your
[2:36:18] attention and in that way he magnified
[2:36:21] that Ministry to you now you can trust
[2:36:23] it
[2:36:27] praise the Lord
[2:36:29] I I don't have to come and preach and
[2:36:31] says I mean you got to believe me
[2:36:35] you may have been all here that's why
[2:36:36] you don't believe me I mean you got to
[2:36:38] believe me I'm telling you the truth
[2:36:39] y'all got to believe you are just you
[2:36:41] are just wasting water on door back
[2:36:43] the way God does this is that the
[2:36:47] ministry labor with the people and God
[2:36:50] will do something
[2:36:52] he would do something
[2:36:54] that would just magnify their Ministry
[2:36:58] and right there you start to trust that
[2:37:00] ministry that's the way it works
[2:37:05] that's the way it works
[2:37:09] praise the Lord
[2:37:10] amen
[2:37:11] now if when God established a Ministry
[2:37:14] before the people
[2:37:17] I don't I don't have to look for uh uh
[2:37:20] you know uh uh to to to to to find
[2:37:23] somebody to pray for every Sunday before
[2:37:25] you can believe that really and you know
[2:37:27] I'm really spiritual no when the
[2:37:30] ministry is magnified before the people
[2:37:32] what God will do most often you will see
[2:37:35] that and for for a long time uh you know
[2:37:39] you know as a preacher you thinks about
[2:37:40] it because you go out of your local
[2:37:43] church
[2:37:44] and then Supernatural things will happen
[2:37:48] then you ask yourself why why is it not
[2:37:50] happening back home because you don't
[2:37:52] need it
[2:37:56] amen because the reason why God would do
[2:37:59] those things is not to vindicate the man
[2:38:02] the reason why God would do that is to
[2:38:06] vindicate his word
[2:38:10] so if God has already by the grace of
[2:38:13] God granted you favor with this person
[2:38:16] amen that you can believe what they
[2:38:20] preach to you God don't need to perform
[2:38:22] Miracle every Sunday
[2:38:25] no
[2:38:31] he don't need to well if you need
[2:38:34] miracle then God might bring Miracle
[2:38:36] your way
[2:38:37] if you say Lord accept this brother heal
[2:38:40] the sake I can't believe him
[2:38:42] then God might bring it your way if he
[2:38:44] pleases the Lord
[2:38:47] or maybe he's not just the person to
[2:38:50] pass to you
[2:38:52] because the truth about the matter there
[2:38:54] is the other not every man is designed
[2:38:56] to Pastor you
[2:38:59] that's just the truth about the matter
[2:39:11] are we together
[2:39:13] so Paul says here I have a a magnify my
[2:39:16] office because he could identify that he
[2:39:19] was called to the Gentiles
[2:39:22] are we together
[2:39:24] let me just read one of two things here
[2:39:26] and then uh
[2:39:28] uh
[2:39:31] uh this will help us as we look out of
[2:39:34] this now
[2:39:36] now okay this is one of the things that
[2:39:39] I would have read to you earlier brother
[2:39:40] Brown says here he says Church order he
[2:39:43] talks he says now remember the Deacon is
[2:39:46] a policeman and a deacon office is
[2:39:49] actually more straight
[2:39:51] than most any office in the church
[2:39:55] amen
[2:39:57] I don't know of any any office any more
[2:40:01] straighter than the Deacon office
[2:40:02] because if you read the scripture you
[2:40:05] will see that the same qualification for
[2:40:09] a pastor is the same qualification for a
[2:40:12] deacon
[2:40:14] that's why butter Brandon means when he
[2:40:16] says the decom office is the most
[2:40:18] straightest office
[2:40:20] praise the Lord amen a man is not
[2:40:24] choosing as a deacon because he's a
[2:40:25] friend to the pastor no there's a
[2:40:28] scriptural qualification
[2:40:34] is the most straightest office now he
[2:40:37] says that's right because he got a real
[2:40:40] job and he got and he's God's man he's
[2:40:44] he's God's man just as much as the
[2:40:47] pastor is God's man certainly he is he
[2:40:51] is God Seven
[2:40:53] praise the Lord
[2:40:55] now uh so we see here that uh uh uh over
[2:41:01] in the book of Arts where deacons were
[2:41:03] introduced the Bible says that the
[2:41:06] apostles says so we can give ourself
[2:41:10] to the word and to prayer
[2:41:12] choose a man that are filled with the
[2:41:15] Holy Ghost
[2:41:17] so they can take care of the Affairs of
[2:41:20] the people
[2:41:22] now so that's what brother Branham means
[2:41:24] it's an office that comes between the
[2:41:27] people and the ministry
[2:41:32] amen
[2:41:36] praise the Lord
[2:41:38] instead of the pastor being at the baby
[2:41:42] showers the baby birthday
[2:41:45] amen
[2:41:46] praise the Lord birthday party all the
[2:41:49] pastor didn't come to my birthday party
[2:41:55] he will not have a baby shower
[2:42:01] scripturally he must give himself to the
[2:42:03] word and to prayer
[2:42:07] praise the Lord
[2:42:09] that's what he must do
[2:42:10] he must give himself to the word and to
[2:42:12] pray
[2:42:15] yeah then the deacons must be able to
[2:42:18] step in and and be able to serve the
[2:42:20] people in uh in in in the roles of their
[2:42:24] activities
[2:42:25] praise the Lord then he also says this
[2:42:28] now listening to this now
[2:42:31] gives and calling now let's uh uh Ellie
[2:42:35] spiritual experience
[2:42:38] now let's get back to what they are God
[2:42:42] set them aside God placed them in the
[2:42:45] church I think I will find a place to
[2:42:47] close right here
[2:42:49] is a good place to close God gave Sarah
[2:42:52] as he will is that right not as I will
[2:42:56] but as he will now if God want me
[2:43:00] but I'm talking himself God want me to
[2:43:03] be a lay member of the church I would
[2:43:06] rather
[2:43:07] he says I did be better off a lay member
[2:43:12] then I will be a preacher
[2:43:17] amen
[2:43:19] all right I would rather be a lead
[2:43:21] member and then I will be a preacher
[2:43:23] you see so this message has produced
[2:43:27] some of the smartest preachers on the
[2:43:28] Earth
[2:43:30] praise the Lord because I mean you can
[2:43:32] go and talk about serpent seed and
[2:43:34] people will just say wow
[2:43:37] wow
[2:43:39] I never heard that it's in the Bible
[2:43:42] praise the Lord
[2:43:44] and then maybe your ministry can start
[2:43:46] from there
[2:43:49] praise the Lord
[2:43:51] I know many that that over the years
[2:43:53] that have even come into conflict
[2:43:56] you'll find brother Branham dedicating
[2:43:58] baby and he says Lord I dedicate this
[2:44:00] boy may he be a minister
[2:44:02] and definitely people cling to that
[2:44:06] and they think brother Branham give that
[2:44:08] child a Ministry
[2:44:11] well I wish all the brothers here will
[2:44:13] be minister
[2:44:14] praise the Lord then let's get the work
[2:44:17] doing
[2:44:19] praise the Lord
[2:44:21] amen
[2:44:25] I mean I mean that's that's pretty much
[2:44:27] the same where Moses said I wish every
[2:44:28] every man here will have have the spirit
[2:44:31] and then the work will become easier
[2:44:36] so people comes into that into those
[2:44:38] conflicts
[2:44:43] they watch over their child the child
[2:44:45] grow you know brother Brian pray over
[2:44:46] you to be a pastor
[2:44:49] then that thing get in the child head
[2:44:52] praise the Lord about the Bible to put
[2:44:54] it under the child
[2:44:55] and to stop propping him up
[2:45:00] praise the Lord
[2:45:05] well I mean I mean
[2:45:07] school days we get we get we get uh we
[2:45:09] get excited you know we we like to
[2:45:11] witness for the Lord you know and and we
[2:45:14] go with this and then we lead souls to
[2:45:15] Christ you know we testified about God
[2:45:17] and and and and I mean you just you just
[2:45:20] have that burden at that time God puts
[2:45:22] you to a place because he knows Elites
[2:45:24] are there they are going to respond to
[2:45:26] the word
[2:45:30] but you know the part the Apostle Paul
[2:45:33] says every man should wait on his
[2:45:34] ministry
[2:45:36] that comes different
[2:45:39] because you lay souls to the Lord does
[2:45:41] not make you a Ministry make you a
[2:45:43] minister
[2:45:47] are we together
[2:45:49] amen
[2:45:57] it's an anointing it's a burden that
[2:45:59] comes now I'm saying this now let me go
[2:46:02] right ahead brother Branham says I'd
[2:46:03] rather be a limit than to be a preacher
[2:46:06] he says see because I will only bring
[2:46:08] reproach somewhere along the line
[2:46:12] when a man is not called to do it you
[2:46:15] will bring reproach along the line
[2:46:20] praise the Lord
[2:46:22] amen I mean I remember being so
[2:46:25] terrified to be a preacher to stop
[2:46:27] preaching even though I was I was
[2:46:29] preaching but to stop preaching I don't
[2:46:32] know what I'm saying but I'm saying it
[2:46:33] anyway
[2:46:34] you know as I was going out to the
[2:46:36] hospital and and going over to the the
[2:46:40] praising and all of that but just to
[2:46:42] take on the ministry that was very very
[2:46:44] terrified until I was at a place what I
[2:46:47] was I was praying and asking the Lord
[2:46:49] some let something happen let something
[2:46:51] happen something bad should happen
[2:46:56] praise the Lord because I was I was
[2:46:58] terrified I mean I was terrified
[2:47:01] I was terrified
[2:47:03] and then so what happened there we had
[2:47:05] we had group of brothers that we were
[2:47:07] meeting and and we used to encourage
[2:47:09] ourselves back 1993 we would meet and
[2:47:13] but then the thing about it there is
[2:47:15] that every time it will fall back on me
[2:47:17] what we are doing you know what what we
[2:47:19] are doing okay what what does this say
[2:47:21] and what happened also God God blessed
[2:47:24] me and at the time I was traveling at
[2:47:25] that time the only my only property I
[2:47:27] had was just message books the few
[2:47:29] message books that I had that was my
[2:47:30] only property that I had on Earth so
[2:47:33] when I got and met those Brothers you
[2:47:35] know yeah we had a little material that
[2:47:37] we could work with and all of that so uh
[2:47:40] we started we we joined ourselves to a
[2:47:42] Pentecostal brother that we met in a
[2:47:45] church and this guy was a fire restrict
[2:47:47] evangelist my goodness he can get on the
[2:47:50] street and I mean that oh my goodness
[2:47:52] the guy can he can preach and I mean we
[2:47:54] were there there was some scriptural
[2:47:57] truth that we spoke about you know he he
[2:47:59] just couldn't see it at the time so but
[2:48:03] it was all all because of my fear I
[2:48:05] never wanted to to to to start leading
[2:48:10] people in the sense of a Ministry but by
[2:48:13] the grace of God we knew what the verse
[2:48:15] is you know and there were some few
[2:48:16] things that you know we would sit down
[2:48:18] and talk about now he had his
[2:48:21] understanding because he was from United
[2:48:22] Pentecostal church and he believed that
[2:48:25] uh
[2:48:26] you know that we didn't know how the
[2:48:28] Holy Ghost because we were not speaking
[2:48:29] the tongues so there are things that
[2:48:31] were that will happen in the church you
[2:48:33] know you give the he has some of uh you
[2:48:36] know some some people with him that came
[2:48:38] back from the same church and there was
[2:48:40] something that happened
[2:48:42] early one morning around seven o'clock
[2:48:45] in the morning I saw this this brought
[2:48:47] it over to my house he was ordering us
[2:48:49] at the time he came over to my house and
[2:48:51] Bam out the door we came I came outside
[2:48:53] I said what's wrong
[2:48:55] he said brother I need to talk to you
[2:48:58] he pulled me the side because he he knew
[2:49:01] that I had some some uh
[2:49:04] how can I call it now some influence
[2:49:07] over the brothers
[2:49:08] he knew that in some way they were
[2:49:10] looking towards me
[2:49:12] you know so he pulled me the side and
[2:49:15] then he told me what happened
[2:49:18] he told me what happened
[2:49:20] and uh
[2:49:23] and I want to go into the detail of that
[2:49:25] and uh and then when he told me there
[2:49:30] he just told me he says he told me he
[2:49:33] said
[2:49:37] he said you know I have always struggled
[2:49:39] when you told me
[2:49:40] that giving callings without repentance
[2:49:44] that a man could have a gift without the
[2:49:46] Holy Ghost I've always struggled with
[2:49:49] that but now I believe it
[2:49:52] this is now I believe it
[2:49:55] amen
[2:49:57] praise the Lord
[2:50:01] because I mean with the way that he was
[2:50:04] electrified in his gift I mean he's an
[2:50:07] evangelist the way he was electrified in
[2:50:09] his gift I mean we met because we're at
[2:50:12] a Pentecostal church and he was
[2:50:14] preaching and I mean me and the brothers
[2:50:16] thought well I mean we were the firing
[2:50:17] line I mean we were shouting preaching
[2:50:20] you know so after that he made contact
[2:50:23] with us but to just realize the things
[2:50:26] that he was caught in at the time
[2:50:29] he just he just told me so now it put me
[2:50:33] to the place where you have to do
[2:50:35] something I just told him you know I
[2:50:37] respect everything you know we talk we
[2:50:39] pray along with him just just a young
[2:50:41] young man at a time but then I just told
[2:50:43] him I said
[2:50:45] well because of this just to realize
[2:50:48] that you knew all of this and you never
[2:50:51] said nothing about it we can't continue
[2:50:53] together
[2:50:55] so we we will break away down we are on
[2:50:58] our own what are we going to do
[2:51:03] so then by the grace of God we started
[2:51:06] working with the brothers and started
[2:51:07] working with the brothers and and uh by
[2:51:10] God's grace the church was birth at the
[2:51:12] time
[2:51:13] now so I want to say this because
[2:51:15] brother Brandon said you would bring you
[2:51:17] would bring reproach somewhere along the
[2:51:19] line he said and it will be some
[2:51:22] something that will bring reproach
[2:51:26] if if he's called to be a deacon
[2:51:30] it's better for me to be a deacon then I
[2:51:35] will be
[2:51:37] to be a minister
[2:51:39] but if he's called call me to be a
[2:51:42] minister I did better off a minister
[2:51:46] then I will be to be a land member is
[2:51:50] wherever God has called us and set us in
[2:51:54] the church for his seven
[2:51:57] then
[2:51:59] we fit better
[2:52:02] praise the Lord
[2:52:04] amen then we fit better
[2:52:09] are we together
[2:52:11] praise the Lord
[2:52:14] we will stop here
[2:52:16] we we still have
[2:52:19] more to cover on the subject but I I
[2:52:22] wanted to use this time just to talk
[2:52:25] about the nature of the ministry
[2:52:28] and even to talk about the nature of the
[2:52:31] ministry I was I would say this you know
[2:52:34] as I'm as I'm dealing with nature you
[2:52:37] know uh uh God gave us Natures for
[2:52:42] different things that he call us to do
[2:52:45] okay let me let me read something to you
[2:52:47] I said that was the last one I read to
[2:52:49] you but something just popped in my mind
[2:52:52] yet it's not part of my nose there
[2:52:55] but it will it will it will bless you
[2:52:59] just to see how God
[2:53:02] deal with us as his children
[2:53:06] amen
[2:53:09] just to see how he deal with us as his
[2:53:12] children
[2:53:13] of this this thought came to my mind if
[2:53:16] I can find it now and I would share it
[2:53:18] if I can't find it then I would have to
[2:53:19] do it another time
[2:53:22] [Music]
[2:53:24] because
[2:53:26] I mean there are things that we we want
[2:53:30] to we want to watch
[2:53:32] you know
[2:53:34] we want to watch I would not want to
[2:53:35] paraphrase it if I can find it then I
[2:53:38] will
[2:53:39] I will I'll try to read it another time
[2:53:42] I know I have it here but maybe I did
[2:53:45] not put a subject on it which of course
[2:53:47] is a bad thing that I do all the time
[2:53:49] it's hard for me to be able to to find
[2:53:51] things that way if I don't put a subject
[2:53:54] on it
[2:53:55] praise the Lord
[2:53:57] but every one of us I mean the things
[2:53:59] that we we are called to do do for the
[2:54:03] Lord
[2:54:04] uh
[2:54:05] we want to make sure that uh by the
[2:54:08] grace of God we are walking
[2:54:10] we are walking in the light of God's
[2:54:13] word
[2:54:14] uh we
[2:54:17] know we are following his instruction
[2:54:21] you know because he never fails
[2:54:24] yeah he never fails praise the Lord
[2:54:28] God call us and uh
[2:54:38] okay no that's that's not what I want to
[2:54:40] read but uh I I will get it and then I
[2:54:42] will bring it to you that would that
[2:54:44] will make it perfect sense I don't want
[2:54:45] to to start something here then and uh
[2:54:49] and just paraphrase but uh uh we are all
[2:54:52] called you know when and God these with
[2:54:55] us I call into our nature
[2:54:59] I mean even even as our young people you
[2:55:02] know uh
[2:55:03] uh uh you know we choose our path of
[2:55:06] career and things that we go into you
[2:55:09] want to watch all of that you know you
[2:55:11] want to watch all of that because when
[2:55:13] we started this series we spoke about uh
[2:55:16] Paul being called caught between his
[2:55:19] calling and his ambitions
[2:55:21] he had an ambition to be a Pharisees
[2:55:24] he had an ambition he wanted a place of
[2:55:27] authority
[2:55:28] praise the Lord
[2:55:30] he never even had an idea that he he was
[2:55:33] he was predestinated to be a prophet of
[2:55:36] an age he was predestinated to be an
[2:55:39] apostle to the Gentiles he were
[2:55:42] predestinated to be the one that would
[2:55:44] bring the New Testament book
[2:55:51] so he got he got caught between there he
[2:55:54] struggled between that all of his lives
[2:55:57] the road of Damascus made a difference
[2:55:59] for him
[2:56:01] amen and that's what we all need we need
[2:56:04] the road of Damascus you might not have
[2:56:06] a light kicking you off at us but you
[2:56:09] need a place where God have to bring you
[2:56:11] to attention
[2:56:13] praise the Lord
[2:56:16] or as you will just wander in your
[2:56:18] Christian Life you were carried oh I
[2:56:19] know uh brother Brandon is a message the
[2:56:22] messenger a baptized in Jesus name all
[2:56:25] you can talk about this other message
[2:56:27] you talk about this all the preacher
[2:56:29] talk about this other uh subject but you
[2:56:32] are never settled
[2:56:36] you are never settled where you are
[2:56:39] setting in your spirit
[2:56:41] what you are called to do
[2:56:44] you are just all over the place
[2:56:50] praise the Lord
[2:56:52] so we talk about the faithful Ministry
[2:56:54] but it's not only the fight for Ministry
[2:56:56] we know that they are nine spiritual
[2:56:57] gifts
[2:57:00] praise the Lord
[2:57:02] Paul talks about the people that I give
[2:57:04] to us you know a gift of help a gift of
[2:57:07] administration and all of those other
[2:57:09] things
[2:57:15] the thing that we want to find out is
[2:57:20] how am I a blessing to the body
[2:57:25] how am I a blessing to the body
[2:57:31] praise the Lord
[2:57:34] amen
[2:57:35] how am I a blessing to the body
[2:57:39] if we find a statement that has been
[2:57:42] prominent around the church
[2:57:45] salvation is an individual affair
[2:57:48] that's a that's a prominent statement
[2:57:50] around the church
[2:57:52] but it's not scriptural in the sense
[2:57:54] that we think about it
[2:57:57] it's true salvation is an individual
[2:57:59] affair
[2:58:00] but not you as an individual is he as an
[2:58:04] individual
[2:58:06] it is his effect salvation has never
[2:58:08] been your faith
[2:58:11] ability
[2:58:12] it is his affair
[2:58:15] so most of the time when people think
[2:58:17] salvation is an individual affair they
[2:58:19] take it in a selfish way
[2:58:22] I don't have to mind while other people
[2:58:24] saying I don't have to do what other
[2:58:25] people say I'm going to serve God the
[2:58:27] way I know it it does not work like that
[2:58:33] it does not work like that
[2:58:35] he is the individual it is his affair
[2:58:39] now you as an individual
[2:58:41] when has salvation become our effect
[2:58:44] when
[2:58:46] we were all lost
[2:58:48] he's the one that came to save us
[2:58:51] he's the one had an appointed time that
[2:58:53] came down to save us then when have it
[2:58:56] become our Affair that we think we can
[2:58:58] Champion it
[2:59:00] it is his affair
[2:59:04] praise the Lord so he deal with us as a
[2:59:07] body
[2:59:08] that's the reason why he never throw us
[2:59:10] down from Earth from heaven you jump in
[2:59:13] the jungle you go here no he brought us
[2:59:16] through a family
[2:59:18] he gave us father and mother for us to
[2:59:21] be breath on Earth
[2:59:23] that's the same way he deal with his
[2:59:25] church he brings us through a body
[2:59:28] that we can be connected to
[2:59:36] spoken word is the Original Seed that's
[2:59:38] what the prophet said life comes through
[2:59:40] the body
[2:59:44] it comes through the body
[2:59:46] and that's how God deals with us
[2:59:54] are we together
[2:59:56] let's buy our house together now
[3:00:13] pleasing let me be pleasing to you
[3:00:20] sorry for taking your time
[3:00:24] but don't worry I have more of your time
[3:00:26] to take

[3:02:16] Lord was the sickest body but after the
[3:02:18] opening of the seals Lord your prophet
[3:02:23] never use that statement
[3:02:26] because the fullness of the word was to
[3:02:29] bring healing to the body
[3:02:32] if your body is the sickest body you can
[3:02:34] heal the sick you raise the dead Lord
