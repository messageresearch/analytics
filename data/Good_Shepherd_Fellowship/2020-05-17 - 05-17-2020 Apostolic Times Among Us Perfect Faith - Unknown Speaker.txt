morning amen I want to do a little review here of the few things we've been talking about and I read I read a caught on Wednesday night from from the message FFA I want to use that as mine now in the last mine my subject this morning I will go back to dead FFA what he says trying to get the church to a place and and I believe that's what we've been trying to do you know talking on the seed of the promise you know talking on the promised seed and and all the different things that we've been trying to talk about there my spirit flow freely and I mean just around this time we've been we've been working on on the Holy Ghost you know on yielding to the Holy Ghost so running ourself to the Holy Ghost and so like brother Brennan said here he says trying to get the church to a place to where we could really see apostolic I'm moving among us so taking all of these little subjects and talking about it that's where we provoke in our fatal where we can see apostolic time moving among us so that's what I want to talk about a little bit apostolic time among us and I get a little soft subject here now he says here now continuing to read trying to get get the church into a place to where we who really see apostolic time moving them on us he says that's what we hungry for him in that's what we all hunger that's that's the desire in our hearts because I mean I mean just during the time of Pentecost but scared the church was honored their time of persecution you know what I mean thus a hindrance council wanted to stop this Jesus move or lend me a hug here I don't need a troll mind my coat on the ground sister Phil was nice to tell me in the air praise the Lord he feels so sorry for me just dashing it like they're praising Laura and that's how we going to drop this body one of these days there were no hope to hang it on we just drop it and in here we go praise the Lord amen yes right I always get their feeling in and sometimes I do it like there just to encourage myself that I'm dropping my whole body I just threw it there and then you know just to kind of a provoked me to get into action but she felt so sorry for me and so you don't have to throw it down like the air praise Lord so we are all hungry for there he says and it's just lying right at the door so we have a right at our doors our dough of faith we just have to step into it we have to step into it we are living in a time word we have to provoke you know we have to we have to exercise our faith muscles you know we have to exercise our faith muscles there was there there was something that happened in a week after hearing about our our brother brother on passing and all some of the young people there you know knew them from home in and so I call one of the young man you know he will call me once in a while and so I called him just to encourage him you know and he told me something that I said all my goodness Lord bring this date upon us he told me he says he said he said brother wanna you know he says he says I appreciate it but you know with the young people we have not accepted that yet you know and we believe that God can raise our pastor of us oh my goodness water faith amen you know what a faith I just I just kept quiet on the phone you know because brother Branham says you know if you don't have faith to walk like Enoch he says if another man have their faith you know you just step out of the way don't stand in aware of his faith you know so I just I just said to myself I said all my goodness I mean I was driving I just held my phone I said Lord bring it upon us any man if we can do any young people are ready to do it just bring it upon us you know so I learned that they have been you know a group of the young people they're just crying out you know and just praying I'm India and I mean praise the Lord so the reason is because there were encourage mean on there you know a person might anemia minuses were you know is is you know that is fanatism brother Branham says you know if I pray for people and they die he says I will keep raining you know and it's I mean it's just to the place where we have to exercise our faith you know you have to believe God for something and look and expect it to happen that's the hour that we are living in if you don't do it man I don't know when we be your time to do it praise the Lord so that's that's the place we want to walk this morning you know he says it's right at the Dome he says we see it but we want to see more of it you know we want to see more of it that's what we are looking for we want it such a flaw you know we want to be here in there a happy in emerge again happy in DC you know the Lord did something in Ohio we won is such a flaw you know the Lord did something over in Brainerd or in Rochester we wanted just a flow we want to have the flow of testimony of what God is doing and he says it will be a help to us when we hear those things you know and that's what brother Branham over and over he would talk about different different thing there's a code I'll read to you this morning Lord just helping I'm going ahead of myself I'm so sorry here this morning but if I don't I don't behave I would just miss everything now praise the Lord oh my goodness me praise the Lord man well let's just read the word let's honor the Lord in the reading of the word this morning then we can just jump inside our hands our feet whatsoever you know we just germicide this morning at george chapter 2 George chapter 2 let's rejoice chapter 2 verse 28 George chapter 2 verse 28 that's our scripture we reading this morning and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions and also upon the seven and upon the hem male in those days will I pour out my spirit as chapter 2 there is a promise that's a prophecy in writing as chapter 2 we will read where they're prophecy was fulfilled and praise the Lord amen amen amen now we get over in Acts chapter 2 year praise the Lord what wonderful Jesus we self amen you know God is so so faithful any things that he does in any way that he brings his word to pass amen I mean my talks is so spread out here that I can't even find my stricture okay asked chapter two year and that's verse 15 we're even verse 14 but Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye there dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and ye King to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is about the third day the Terr hour of the day sorry but this is dead this that is happening is that that was prophesied amen this that you seen happening is that they were prophesied so if young people are having that kind of a faith we can say this is dead I mean we have no reason to doubt it he says and this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day say God I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my seven and on my head male I will pour out my spirit I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs in the ebony blood and fire and you know and he goes on and on and on verse 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Amy and Allah bless you let's pray together father we just want to ask your blessing upon your word that we have read we trust that your grace we just come and help us this morning father as we encourage ourselves in this hour that we are living Oh father we just pray Oh God just stir up Oh God our most holy faith just like Jill said Oh God stir our most holy faith this morning father because you promised us love father dad you encourage us Lord to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints here we are father this is our day this is our our Lord we are coming honor this promise we can say like Peter this morning that this is that which was spoken father we thank you bless your word now in Jesus name we pray amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you we can have your seat sober Branham goes on he says this will help us flow out to others we having this thing right at the door if we step into it he said we want to see more of it we want to see Sasha flow and it will help us to flow out to others he said remember Jesus he never used his power for himself he used it for others there's what it was sinful so that's what we I mean we're trying to encourage ourselves this morning you know as we look into this that we want to talk about never Branham also says something in that message I can I will tell you the testimony but listen to this he said he says that's that's perfect faith he says I get spares too you know I get moody I get to a spot to word what get me is where I get to those spells when I get all over work and Satan comes telling me why nobody care for you you really you really haven't got a friend in the world see and so remember I'm not immune to the temptation see I've got to overcome that now let's let's look at what is happening here where Bellamy is talking about you know the time like every one of us we feel that you know and you say to yourself I want people appreciating what I'm doing you know and you say to yourself oh my goodness I mean nobody gave me in a phone call you know I mean you know they never talk about me you know and we go through all of this and you know that they will keep buzzing at our mind and we just mean I mean just like brother branham said he says it's a spell you know Satan keeps spitting in our face with those things you know nobody love you you weapon out he's nobody care for you and you happy Allegheny says you know I mean you are just the worst one everybody see your prayer life see your reading he just keeps spitting you just keep spitting I think we can spit back him in praise the Lord he says remember I'm not I'm not immune to temptation I've got to overcome there he says listen to this now this is where it is he says then when I look back and see something like this and what actually he was talking about a few paragraphs about this he was talking about a healing of a young boy he says doing the seals this ball was sick and the parents took the board I mean the doctors have pronounced him sick with with with with an illness that I didn't put their coat there I have it right here so praise the Lord you know and amber Branham talking about this little boy oh my let me let me get right back there and read the code to you he says I if anybody want to know this little calling year and during the time of the seals the doctor had told that the little boy with rheumatic fever that he had to lay on his back and drink through a tube he says that was it that was what the doctor said and his father and his mother brought him from from the home and and set him in a room pray for him now broadband I'm referring to this these parents brought their son home after the doctor had pronounced him that he's going to live the rest of his life lying on the bed being fair but tube and those parents will not take what the doctor said the broader son home put him in bed and and verbatim says and the Lord Jesus heal him so completely he went back to school and the authorities had the authority called him about it just like the man a beautiful remember now we are talking about apostolic days I mean the the the the authorities call him in about his soul they call especially the man that have pronounced him that he would have to drink from tube the rest of his life they called especially who was waiting on him and so he said he couldn't believe such a thing as dead and they brought the boy down for a test and he was completely normal and well verbatim quotes a scripture he says then Jesus came and attempt of power was broken now so that's what brother Branham was saying when I look back to something like that when the devil threw all his spells on me all you have to do is look back and see what God has done look back to a testimony of God healing somebody or something that God has done in your in your life and then see what the prophet of God says yeah he says when he says and when I look back and see something like that I put it right back in the devil face amen don't spit in his face cough you know you can't take the mucus and stick it in his eyes but about him said I put it right back in his face and and and said what's about that Satan you making me Moody you making me feel that I'm rejected put her right back in his face and say what's about that time when God did this for me what's about that time when God brought me back you know I mean he says I put it right back in his face and say what's about that time he said that helps me to overcome you will never overcome until you can put things right back in the devil face if you just stayed there and cry and cry and cry well I mean he would keep bullying you he would keep spitting in your face I don't even know if he brush his teeth on that but I don't matter about that because you don't have to spit in your face praise the Lord verbatim says and there helps me to overcome what about that amen that was what the Apostle says this is that that's what Peter said and what was he doing he was putting the right back in the face of the devil you don't have to call us drunk this is that are you reading your Bible this is that which was spoken by the Prophet I mean that is the only way that's the reason why God do things in our life so we can point back to what he had done if nothing is happening now you went back to what God has done that this is that praise the Lord verbatim says what's above that amen so that's what we are talking about this morning he says this is dead and I love the way he says it year praise the Lord the resurrection of Lazarus 1951 he says a day that we are living in it's a great Marsh in time do you believe that you know pinch of steps red and wash the neighbors he says mash in time everybody want to impersonate somebody else he says I've always said I didn't care water my my shoes wash my trousers or my shirt match my code he says I want man experience to match God's Bible and when he said you must be born again when they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost I want that I want my experience to match that Peter said this is that if this isn't that I'm going to keep this till death comes amen there's our inspiration this morning I'm going to do this amen I'm having a good time with this and like you can have a good time with this on tear that comes amen so that's what we want to talk about brother Branham says apostolic time is right right at the door and all you have to do you just have to step into a bad faith you have to step into a bad faith you have to take a situation and stand on God's Word no matter what the symptom is no matter how ugly is getting take a situation stand on God's Word and believe God expect God every day to be able to change their thing amen that apostolic time praise the Lord I mean Peter was impressing those people will not take you know a no for an answer the God into a prayer meeting they started praying and because it was already pronounced that Peter was going to be killed I mean they were praying and and and God you know released Peter from praising he went to the prayer meeting praise the Lord those are all apostolic time is right among us but urbana say is to the door we can step in it so that's what we've been trying to encourage ourself because like brother Branham said you know we talk about the I mean the five manifestation of the telephone he says those things that we saw temporarily in his ministry they are going to be things that are going to happen you know just like I said with with Ruth you know a little ballad a wheat heared a little ballet that's what our boss encouraged his workmen to do to just throw a little bonus here for Ruth as she Labor's in the field as she's gleaning a special associate time the church is gleaning you know holding on the promise of God I mean we can come together in big numbers but we are taking God's Word every day applying the talking to our home and we are expecting God to show a little bonus yet and a little bonus there praise the Lord that's why we are encouraging ourselves trying to stir up that apostolic time among us that's our promise we're Branham says we will write the amen to the book of ants because at the end of that book there was no amen to that book because this church has to be the continuation of the book of ads we have to be the continuation of the book of ads we have to the very same thing we saw happening and mourn the believers it's not that we go in to manufacture a God want to do the same he's putting us in the situation in different situation where we can see him reeling them on his people praise the Lord just yesterday there I mean we're steaming and sister quiche they were trying to do something a little bit for her birthday and and I mean we're just doing something to the house and and moreover it was I mean to be able to celebrate her life after the soldering you know and we were set in the airing and you know after everything in we decided to pray and I was praying and and the scripture just struck my mind here is Elijah after the farming he went over to the king you know he was talking to the king of Israel and he was just testifying to the king the different things that God has done he was also talking to the king about the Shimon a woman you know he was testifying God did this you know God get this and God did this and he was telling the shimon a woman even their woman down and you remember that Gentile woman i live somewhere down there says oh yeah yeah I remember hurting and her son even died during that time and God brought him back to life and I mean the king is just sitting down there and he's thinking wow this guy he's talking strange to bring him death back to life these things stay happening in Israel and right at that time the woman and her son was right there trying to plead their case to get their land back her little boy was holding her garment and I mean she was trying to get in trying to find somebody to talk and Elijah talking about this thing he just turned his eyes his eyes fell on the letter he said okay even the woman here yo not know another woman let the little boy here you know so we're BAM says it was not far away you know and even as he talks about the story of this little boy he caught her what Peter said he said even a man of beautiful he said he's right among you now our witness is not far away we're not talking about you know what happened at I the rest he is good for us to talk about it in the days of Elijah is good but our witness is right before us our Whitney is right before us praise the Lord who goes to cold and leave their witness back the witnesses have to be the they have to be there to testify you can say to the judge yes my witness he saw it he was there he heard what happened our witnesses arrived before us today where Bellamy says is right at the door it's right at the door all you need to do is to just step into a bad faith just step into it and start shouting my faith and letting think that you have lost your mind remain even if you lose your MA God and stay able to give you a better thinking than the one that we have right now and praise the Lord I mean apostolic time is right before us that's the thing that we're trying to encourage ourselves into this Holy Ghost is real God is still in the healing business praise the Lord and we were praying there's a young man we've been praying for his work made formal work made two sister Kosan and I mean he was taken to the hospital honor the the cover virus and now and I mean I just was this early this week or maybe last week they asked the wife and you know and the son to come and see him for the last time you know she said when it call her it was going to be to to terror for her to go and see your husband and be him fair way and I mean when Bearden and she came from the area now I mean she I mean she believed that it's not a virus she's believing is something else that is happening to her husband from everything that she saw you know he's spitting out just black things coming from his mouth and not of that and and and and she gone home the next call that she's expecting to get from the doctors is to tell how her husband is gone you know that's what she's suspecting you know the actual weather did she remove the ventilator she said she said no I mean let it be there if God called him out you know I mean he would go and and the doctor call her and she's expecting to hear that I mean her husband has passed they telling her that his fever has gone down praise the Lord and I mean we've we've been placing the situation before the law constantly and just praying in the Lord you can be able ours I was even supposed to go and see her yesterday but the times were net when I correct for me to go and see her and and I mean that that just the doctor has already pronouncing that mean that he's going to pass this life what more can we do you know then just to thank God and believe that God can turn the situation around praise the Lord you know so we believe in God for that just like we did when that young lady had that brain damage from that accident over there in in Rochester that young lady is living today you know she's living today in full consciousness you know I just I just spoke to her a couple of weeks ago so I mean it's right at the door apostolic time is right at the door you just had to step into a buffet and claim your blessing get your own a testimony then I allow the devil to keep spitting in your face amen praise the Lord you can spit back in his face and tell him what's about that amen you have to bring out something that is real to you praise the Lord that's the time that we are living in Amen bourbon sales year in the message expectation 1950 he says it's time that the church needed some good old fashioned apostolic teachings of the Bible to get the thing line up to get our faith line up you know to get our faith line up you know because just like I was talking about those young people you know I was I was talking to one of the sisters did too you know any any whole children they are all you know believing God for this situation so I was telling her asses as his you know there was nothing wrong and says I rather be on the side of those kids believing that God is able to resume then for me to be on the side now believing even if God don't raise him or we are not on the losing side I mean what he comes back on that we are still on the winning side because we know that he is in a better place praise the Lord so I was trying to help the young people also I was talking to their masses as it slope we have to place this thing right for you to live in deny it's not faith it's my faith you have to accept the fact and believe that God can change it living in denial is fear when people are living in denial no it's not happening you are just afraid because you know is happening I thought I said I said look look at Lazarus Jesus even wept he cried so it's not wrong to cry if you have to weep weep and stay believe that God can change the situation that's what faith is faith is accepting the reality and believing that God can change it Jesus saw his disciple he says Lazarus sleepeth it so all yeah he does well if he's relaxing we heard that he was sick if now he is sleeping then which means he's feeling much better Jesus says no I have to make this thing real to these people so the way nothing is a praying he was sleeping we were coming to make a resurrection story Lazarus is dead Lazarus is dead because if he's not dead is not resurrection for the man to rise from the dead he has to be dead praise the Lord so you see most of the time that's what happy you know we are believing one thing and we are confessing the wrong thing that's nothing brother Brahim said it over and over he says the people are always misplacing faith does not fit that is fear if we are in a situation we have to confess it that's what is happening lord I give it to you this is where I am I in your hands because I know you can change the situation you are more than able to change the situation you see the the the Pentecostal church out there they carry master's church they believe the teaching the people not to accept their situation no don't believe it you know I mean confessing confessing positive confessing that God can do it does not means that it's not happening so they are keeping the church in living in denying and that's the reason why the people cannot get victory to step out of their own belief we have to accept whatever is happening to us though we need more of you we need more of you because we believe you can bring us out of this situation we need a revival law because we are drying out we are losing praise we are losing our life of prayer we need a revival that is truth confession look at Isaiah the prophet he said woe is me Lord I'm a man on dawn speaking you know what with the people and I mean he just confessed his sin before God he never come before God to sell all your people I lost he plays himself right in the place of the people that's what faith is faith is she's a man you know confessing and saying their Lord this is the situation we are in but we believe that you open the Red Sea Prince alone when Moses got down there to the Red Sea he never stand and says mind I just hit dry lane no no no that's why he was weeping because Monti was on both side the sea was before him he knew there was nowhere to go he have just said to the people the the the Egyptian you see today you will see them normal forever but where would they go he started weeping faith is not make-believe when we try to make up things we try to create walking in imagination faith is reality we are dealing with real issues before us praise the Lord it's almost like I mean sometimes even we parents we deal with those things when they are real issues going on with our children would you like to draw our overall the address gates you know because they are innocent they are real issues you have to start looking at the real issues and you have to start dealing with it as you believe for God to help that child and that's the way that God deals with us we have to come to him just as we ever Branham says that he says at the time the church neither grew olfaction apostolic teachings there we get the things line up we have to line up everything we have to bring everything in the right context of God's Word for faith to get in action I'm telling you faith is not blind if it was blind when I open the blind eyes praise the Lord faith has chest on his I mean hair on his chest fred has muscles faith is real fear is not blind I'm telling you praise the Lord Amen faith he makes a lean man to walk so if it knows how to walk amen faith knows how to walk fit knows how to talk that's the reason why we have to line up with the word most of the time we are afraid now I was talking to another young man and he was telling me something you know and and and and he sounds like he was confessing fake I told me I said know your language to me is fear if you believe that God can do it then you would go and do what the doctor says praise the Lord amen just this morning I was just I was just getting myself ready and all sorts of things was running to my mind and I was thinking about the young people because I'm thinking about doing something for them you know in such a period of time and the scripture that came to my mind young people if you are listening was speaking the truth in love that's what good friendship is me you know we have to speak the truth in love so well young people you can be expecting that I won't go into death he says the gifts in calling I in the church but the people don't know how to control themselves they don't know how to take hold of God I mean you know I I don't I don't try to I don't try to push the church into into gifts because we have to based on the word but I mean there there are people that have been dreaming I mean some of the sisters been calling me and telling me dreams you know when you know dreaming of us coming back together dreaming of the things that is happening in church dreaming of other people and every time they say that to me and we just talk about it I just pray with them I says well let's pray about it less committed in the hands of God because you don't want to put a gift ahead of the word if the people are not rightly taught by the word they can control the church with gifts and gifts never control the church is the word that control the church but the gifts are there but if we don't line up our faith you know if we don't do things come back to the word and live the way the world want us to live and concentrate our lives we will have problem charging those gifts because if a person is here living a contrary life to the word and you come and bring us a gift by vision or a gift by dreams you trouble our mind it will be difficult for you to receive from me if you have questions on my life that's the reason why every gift is charged by the word no matter how you know real it seems we have to bring it back to the word because we don't want to be controlled by give we want to be led by the word because when the people are controlled by gift and those gifts are not happening then we start manufacturing things and people start saying oh I saw the bird fly through my window or I saw you know I would just come in my head and and and somebody appear in the back in my mirror and then all of these things and then it just start making up things and making up thing before you know the church had just gone into wishcraft say I've seen those things I have seen those things and know what I'm talking about the church need a good old-fashioned apostolic teaching of God to get the things line up the Gibson calling I in the church but the people don't know how to control themselves they don't know how to control themselves because you have to know Satan is going to attack those gates he's going to throw things at you they don't know how to take ahold of God praise the Lord we're talking about apostolic times that is a Mona's it's right at the door praise the Lord apostolic time is for the brothers is for the sisters is for the mothers I mean it's for the young people right in the book of Acts Philip have four daughters they had a gift to prophesy four young daughters that were baptized with the holy God they had a genuine gift they could prophesize praise the Lord and you know what the Bible says even about them they were young they were young people in my mind I'm thinking those young people they were so those those young ladies they were so true just to know that God visited young married at the age of you know a young woman a virgin so every one of them were just keeping himself that God who visited them God would give them the baptism of the holy gold God will do something in your life for young girls poor wind right there in the house they broke up into prophecy they said a man that has this thing trial with for him there in Rome and brother branham even spoke about there he says Paul when it gains the word of God because that prophecy was doubt said the Lord but he because to understand that Paul was so burden to give his life so he knew that their prophecy was speaking about him he knew so there were young people in the book of us praise the Lord I mean we can just pick up all sorts of different things happen in the book of us as chapter 1 the Bible says the promise of the father to make them witnesses that's how the book of I studied you know they were waiting on the promise of the father and the promise of the father is the baptism of the Holy Ghost where God comes down and poured his spirit in the life of his children praise the Lord as chapter 2 they were in one Accord waiting on that promise and the scripture tells us the 120 that were in the upper room brother Branham says even Mary she had to be there God was not going to take an excuse for nothing to see all you know I bet a Lord Jesus for for nine months all I raised him up know she needed to be in an upper room to get a baptism of the Holy Ghost so God is not going to take our experience above the Holy Ghost we have had different experiences he had there with us in different ways but he want us to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the hour that we are living him for every day is an everyday experience he want you to have the Holy Ghost for everyday life just like how David said in the son his mercy is renew every morning go want to give you about is in every morning so you can be able to face the challenge for every day amen we're not going to sneak on one experience fellowship with God through reconciliation brother Branham says that's what the church needs today and olfaction apostolic God shaking Holy Ghost revival and how is it coming through the word how is it coming it's coming right through your home when you can just stay on your knees and cry before God I want a true feeling in my heart I'm going look one Lord I'm getting caught on you I need a true feeling in my heart I need an awakening an apostolic God shaking Holy Ghost revival he says that's right I don't mean a bunch of fanatism it's easier for us to get into fanaticism when it's a group because this other person shouts oh we shall the other person live for their hands so we live for the ends but right now in your bedroom you can have a real experience of God because you can cry out your hand when you if you don't like people to see you crying go in your room and cry now because people come to church they don't want to cry because they don't like people see them crying now you can stay in your room like the dough and cry but that's why we need he says I don't believe in a bunch of emotional work up but I mean a real true blood borne salvation they said man free from sin and make him a new creature in Christ praise the Lord that's what we need because we haven't we having an open door that is right before us and that open door is an apostolic experience we have an open door that we can step right into I'm telling you try your life will never be the same I mean your life will never be the same the Lord I mean that's what we are talking about is this Holy Ghost experience this apostolic time that is right before us this is death I mean you can put it to the devil face you have to look for things what you can put to the devil Fadem allow him to keep blasting your mind with this and blasting your mind with Darin and I just just just making you feeling sick as if there is not a god you have a God in heaven David will not allow that young as young as he was he stepped out there and he saw Goliath he did not care for Goliath sighs he didn't care for his size the thing that troubled David was to hear a Philistine using curse word on Jehovah it was not funny to laugh at like you year all of this conversation people use curse word on God and sometimes we laugh about it if to David it was not funny it was not funny to just walk right in there and seeing a man define almighty god and everybody kept quiet program talks about a story and there happened during the time of Roe Davis I think rod Davis told him their story he says there was a man you know a critic that came out in order and he started criticizing he brought an ascetic thing and says you know something like an icy water or so he said let me see you people yeah he says you say the Bible said you drink daily things and you were not done he says let me see is that a believer yet I can drink this bourbon says a man he says you should know where you are standing I don't advise you to do that he says if God don't call you to do that he says but there was a man in a crowd they will not take that challenge he told his wife he said honey if I die I will meet you in glory but I will not stand you and allow that man to cost God praise the Lord he said he stepped out there by faith he drowned us water and the man was standing there right there and God move on the scene and I men never die he says that all critter has to give his life to God he says that not a man was there criticizing God and he and we're been saying he was just talking you know cursing about God and there was no God it just it just you know affecting make-believing all of that but balance is this old farmer he had his suspended with his jumpsuit on he went in just took an opera and started chewing it he was right to the man I was cursed you know that was being any feeder he stand right to his face he said yeah you tell me is this Apple sweet or sour he says how can I know I never tasted he said that's right you never taste God that's why you are talking about it if you ever get a taste of God you will not say what you are saying oh man that's what we are talking about let's taste God as spirit because it's real this Holy Ghost is real if you ever experience divine healing nobody can tell you anything different because you experience it praise the Lord you ever experience the power of the Holy Ghost nobody can tell you anything he says tell me is it sweet or sour praise the Lord he says how do I know I never tasted he said that's right you never know about God until you taste him I mean that's what David said taste and see how the Lord is good praise the Lord I believe that's the hour that we are living in we can taste and see that our God is good Amen that there is something to this message that God has given to us praise the Lord taste and see that God is good father the hour has come 1956 let's read this one we're balancing and that's what the church needs tonight a garrison of olfaction apostolic teaching he says so this lukewarm farmer in and out up and down doesn't get into our church amen praise the Lord in and out up and down we gave all the reason why you know we can come to church i we are just talking to the people last night and we were talking different things about all when we get back to church how is going to be I said well I don't know we will just see how it's going to be what are we going to just set people on setting date are we going to rotate the Sunday you know but you see no matter how we do it there will still be people that would not want to come to church they would stay give reason why they don't want to come they would say give reasons oh but I'm telling you I'm going to be a deacon at that time if you are scheduled to come a certain time and you come out with some kind of for cheap reason we'll take you out of the list you still home follow Church online maybe that is good for you he says all this lukewarm you know just like we were talking on on iniquity of the animal rights that's exactly what it is look how Jesus please there in the endtime prophecy because iniquity shall abound the love of many will was called so what iniquity does to the believer is that it dispossessed us it takes the strain it takes I mean the energy it takes the encouragement when we started when we start looking in the face of God's Word and start Allari things that we know we should not do it dispossesses you because you know what the devil is going to take that thing and keep blasting your mind you say you are a child of God see what you are doing how can you talk about Apostolic Faith how can you talk about the book of Acts how can you believe God for a resurrection or a rupture or a body change well like I said don't allow him to keep spitting in your face you take him back to what God has done he says that's what we need he says I did say that's right that's right I I have two meter too many things to creep in Brethren's too many things he says that we left the old landmark from the beginning we have left too many things to creep in and now we have got everything in he says and all the Asians and everything you know and everything is in the church because we never garrison by the word and that's what we're trying to do to get back to the world amen we're trying to get back to the word there was how Peter defend himself he had to defend the church he says this is that if you want to know what is happening in the month of this that is happy we have a prophecy that we can take it back to and that's how we have to do as end time believers we have to find ourself in the Bible we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled the Bible speaks of the hour that we are living in Bible speaks prophesied about you know us moving right into this time we can say this day looking at that stripped you're looking at what God is doing in our life in our maze the message influency said we have we have come times that people think that this holiness before God is just some kind of a mockery people just think is some kind of a mockery but that is the thing that released the life of God I released the power of God when the people consecrate himself when the people keep themselves away from unbelief to keep themselves away from lie they don't fill their mind with the things on the media normal chapter 6 it talks about that the the nasara coveting now honor the Old Testament they are coveting a man or a woman who choose to give themself for a certain period of time you can go for six months or you can go for a year and just consecrate yourself and then honor than the nasara covenant you look so old because you grow your head I mean and I mean you just you just looking everybody knows that that person is concentrated they are living I mean they are concentrating himself use you you take yourself away from whining and Adam you you just extend yourself where everybody no they kept themselves before God but under the law they can go in and come out but honor this new covenant is God that call his people into that nasara company it comes by the new birth when we are born again we are separated from this world wash by the water of the word so it brings us to the place that's the reason why we can live a holy life one week and gets back to the things of the word no then you are not caught under this new covenant he says people thing there this holiness before God is just some kind of a mockery or some kind of a bunch of people would blossom know some kind of a cut or and that's that's what the things that's what it thinks sometimes the young people thinks you are forcing certain things on them I have the desire to do this but I mean I mean the church this is why the church believe it it's not what the church believed is what comes by the new birth it has to leave if it is now flowing out of you which means you need to be born again it's not some kind of a card or something but let me assure you brothers let me assure you sisters let me assure you young people there may be a lot of mockery I don't say here is he I can say there I'm just a man and I know George I'm just I'm just to preach but there is a generally goes a journey or apostolic power of the Holy Spirit people may make a mockery out of faith you know that's the reason why I said in church I mean the one all all the men to wear white shirt and black pants you know as an identification or all the women to tie the I had no we just want you to be decent a man it must just flow out of you it must be something that you desire to do to live a decent life praise the Lord we're not forcing nothing down your throat praise the Lord I'm telling you if I fall sit down your Troy is going to run your stomach Amy first of all you better chew it little by little and have God to to help you digest it and have God to have it run through your veins so you can be able to live out I mean some people force this thing down their throat ear and their stomach and they got out of it praise the Lord this is that that's all we've been trying to do preaching all of these messages children of the promise children of the light all of this is to just encourage us that we are right at a place where we where we have the opportunity to experience God for our self you can experience God for yourself in your home you can believe for your loved ones some people think is just a market you know they're just there I mean I mean they have to get into a press situation I mean a life-threatening situation before they get serious for God you talk to them they just give you some kind of force matchy and I mean it not even spending time they can't even I mean just just meditate on God's Word spend time with God we all get spells and settle comes around and he tells you things sometimes I want it not not about you or he tells to you thinks about I mean your loved one and tells you thing about your house mother tells you thing about your wife and then you want to believe the devil of us word if you think that person is a child of God don't believe what the devil says no matter what they are doing believe what God's Word says believe God's promise that God is able to change the situation when we grow up and stop being crybaby amen we Jamie we just we just cry for every little things I mean it's time for us to stand on those promises stand on the promises this is that this is dead bird Bram talks about all of these things and that that man talking talking to that little girl and she said you know how do you know that you know that Jonah swallow you know or a fish swallow Jonah he she says because the Bible says it praise the Lord well I mean maybe it was just a story that the Bible was making she says no the Bible says that the Bible is the Word of God so I believe it praise the Lord she says well and I get to heaven you know talk to John about it he says what if Jonah is not in heaven and then she said you talked to him and you asked him about it because I know I'm going to heaven if he's not in heaven he's in hell then you talk to him about it she wouldn't I allowed a credit to spit in your face and you don't allow unbelievers who spit in your face about the promises of God tell them you never know about they don't tell you tasting you will not know if it's sweet or sour until you taste it don't tell me that there is no God I know there is a God because I'm alive that is the door of I mean a door of opportunity that is before us where balance is apostolic time is right before us it's at the door we can step into it you don't have to make up things just simple faith take God by His Word take God by His Word no matter how things are becoming negative and ugly you have to fight that mind battle I can get in your mind to fight I'm gonna have to preach the word when I leave from here I get out there I fight my own battles in my mind because the devil brings all sorts of things to my mind you have to take the word if you can remember no Bible verse stop singing me that will help you you pick up your pen write a love letter to Jesus that's why brother Branham did stick it up in your closet put it on your mirror oh you can even leave a note for the devil at your dome just write a big no sticking on your door when he gets there let him read it sit on you and I allow in here but that's the time that is before us it's right at the door God giving you us an opportunity that we can be able to experience you talking to a loved one or someone on the phone that is down and I mean feeling in me discouraged don't finish that conversation and just let them dry like that give them an opportunity you can pray with that person on the phone let me let just have a word of Prayer I mean there is the Regis there is just no human heart that is broken I don't care how evil that person is how much they hate God when they get to that breaking point and you see let us pray you just have to give in they would just have to give him but most of the time we are afraid we try to calculate things in our mind when we are just supposed to stand right there make ourself available that's how faith works you just you just got to make yourself available say Lord you say when I open my mouth you give me the right word to speak that's the time that is before us you can tell the devil this is dad I'm telling he's not going to believe it he's going to come again and bring another reason why this is not right you bring another reason why you know sit on sticks on his own belief for you to give into it and you have to stick on your belief you have to stick on your belief that devil and his gun I mean his shots they are just it's an empty book empty bullet he has he knows that that is the reason why when he starts shooting at you he just make a lot of noise just to have to make you afraid but he just know that one shot from of God's Word is able to blast him back to hell he knows that so when he start talking to your mind he just don't say one thing and keep quiet he don't know how to keep his mouth shut you have to know they're known about this devil he talks about this and he talks about that and he connected to this and he connected to that and he just go on and go on and go on because you enjoy hearing him talk sometimes you just have to be physical and shout shut up devil praise the Lord I mean it just not only send him to hell they send all his demons to hell because when he's died Ronnie the little ones knows that they got to get away from you sometimes you just have to get a hold of the situation don't allow the situation together all of you I mean that's the time that we are living in see these people scare for their life Roma's have gone all over the place that they have stole Jesus body and they are eating it the Pharisees came out with this lie the Roman government is now concerned there will be a plague these people are eating bodies they will go out of men and into the marketplace just like what we are dealing with they are afraid they are all looking out and watching for them we know how the dress we know how how the behaving how they go about and these people know these believers no they don't have no life until God comes down and fulfill his promise they have their loved ones out there they will not be able to go and see but you will realize what happened when the Baptistina of the Holy Ghost come I mean the Holy Ghost came down in the lake of fire upon these people nobody told them to get out even the ones that was shamed to testified of their faith they were standing in the street speaking Galilean language and it was not only the men even the women and the children that was among them I mean such an experienced sweep over the place don't tell me they were not children a more name they were children horsemen and why would they will leave their children with you know how the heart of mothers goes after their children they were now wicked to leave their children back the same way you bring your children to church that's the same way they have their children there in those prayer meetings they sister have a little place where to go and breastfeed their children but they all wanted the promise of the Holy Ghost when you've got this assurance India heart oh my goodness it was just like receiving a payment from the governor then now you can go anywhere in everywhere they were ready to go to their homes they were ready to face death in the face the new now this was their time this was their opportunity you read a book you know of the Mata you see all of those things that were happening but you also have to realize there were young believers in those days there were women in those days I mean there were young couples in those days it's the same thing the same time that we are living in but it was their time I mean you read the story in and and you see the some of them there I mean they were they were ready I mean I mean just out of time they knew that they were on a persecution I mean you you read those things some of them just got married and they were ready to go and and and face whatever their tribe was that's the time that we are living in apostolic time among us we can read it and imagine it but we have the opportunity to step by faith even a God will use us for one situation there's believers bringing you know their knee is trying to help the ones that I mean that where we're now fortunate to get I mean and I mean the Spirit of God was just moving a modem but Brenham says God how to allow there because it was time for his word to spray out the see they have gone into the ground was now ready to bring forth many fruits in all of those disciples you heard about Andrews it's almost like when those guys went out of the you know their upper room everybody was looking for an opportunity to do something for the Lord even Thomas he was so hurt in his heart he doubted a resurrection but after he saw Jesus he said my lord oh my god he got on a boat and went to another part of the world is that India or wherever he went to bring for the gospel in that area but this is our day this is our time we can be positive we can take God's promise we can encourage one another we can encourage them that are downhearted somebody losing their loved ones you can be able to talk to them about a hope of the Resurrection look that's the only future that is before us young people the only future the better word that we have to come is the Millennium that's the better word that we have to come this world is just a temporary place God would give us a little window year for us to put ourself together you know what he's going to give us a window for us to do some garage sales you know who let go of all of those baggages that we are carrying get it back to the devil just sell it free give you verbatim sense is on time to pack we have to unpack all the things you know that we just been carrying on things from the past he would give us a little window for us to do there because it's time for the Exeter it's time for us to get out of here when the scripture says come Lord Jesus I mean that's there supposed to be the team on our hands come Lord Jesus yes let's go to the Lord in prayer Amy and you run me out of mind not so fast as they feel like
