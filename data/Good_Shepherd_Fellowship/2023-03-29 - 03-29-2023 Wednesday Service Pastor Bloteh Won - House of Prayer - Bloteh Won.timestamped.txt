[42:47] there that we must join our cell phone

[43:05] the technicians love us so much that
[43:07] they have the Bible on the computer

[43:18] because I've seen it in few different
[43:21] times you know it's it's like somebody's

[45:51] so uh pray for me and as I pray for you
[45:55] praise the Lord
[45:58] so but why studying there there was
[46:00] something that caught my attention and
[46:02] it came it came very strong
[46:04] to my attention tonight so I decided to
[46:08] get away from what I wanted to talk
[46:09] about and then and then just just Dash

[47:47] the verse they were cutting

[49:17] and let's go to
[49:20] to uh uh let's go to Luke
[49:26] let's go to
[49:28] see Luke chapter 19.
[49:31] let's go to sin Luke Chapter 19. I will
[49:33] I will get back on these scriptures on
[49:35] Sunday but I just I just want you to be
[49:38] able to get the picture here for tonight
[49:40] and then I will go in the direction
[49:42] where I want to go tonight
[49:44] praise the Lord
[49:49] see Luke chapter 19.
[49:59] Hallelujah
[50:09] praise the Lord
[50:11] praise the Lord amen
[50:26] okay it's in Luke Chapter 19. Let's uh
[50:28] let's read from
[50:32] let's read from verse 37.
[50:35] I just want to show you a senior
[50:38] that you will be able to grab the
[50:40] picture so when we get back to you on
[50:42] Sunday you will know exactly where we
[50:44] are
[50:45] and when he was come night
[50:49] even now at The Descent of Mount Olive
[50:53] the whole multitude of the disciples
[50:57] begin to rejoice and praise God with a
[51:01] loud voice
[51:03] for all the mighty works that they have
[51:07] seen same blessed be the king that
[51:11] cometh in the name
[51:13] of the Lord
[51:15] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[51:20] and some of the Pharisees from among the
[51:24] multitudes said unto him Master rebuke
[51:28] thy disciples now that's that's word the
[51:33] that's word the catch is
[51:36] praise the Lord
[51:38] why did they say rebuke that disciple
[51:42] because by them referring
[51:46] to disarm by them repeating this Psalm
[51:49] blessed is the king that cometh in the
[51:53] name of the Lord
[51:55] you remember when Jesus asked him and
[51:58] says what did David said my lord said
[52:01] unto my Lord
[52:03] they could not answer that question
[52:05] because it points directly to the
[52:08] Messiah
[52:10] praise the Lord
[52:11] so we will get into more of the history
[52:14] but where the cash is there is the other
[52:18] by the people shouting blessed be the
[52:22] king that cometh in the name of the Lord
[52:25] and have the the Pharisees on a
[52:28] conviction that they are proclaiming him
[52:31] to be the Messiah
[52:33] and then also it was putting them in
[52:37] challenge with the Romans
[52:39] they are they are declaring that he is a
[52:42] king
[52:44] praise the Lord
[52:46] so they are they started saying uh
[52:49] Master tell your disciples to stop that
[52:53] because they never wanted to get now you
[52:56] have to grab the picture in your mind
[52:58] these people were on the on the on the
[53:01] room at the time pilate was the governor
[53:04] there he was just a young man that came
[53:07] and took over Jerusalem to stop all the
[53:10] rioting and so whenever the Jews got
[53:14] together like this Whenever there was a
[53:16] shouting the Romans always came around
[53:18] because they wanted to make sure there
[53:21] was no riot
[53:23] there was nothing that would disturb the
[53:26] peace so definitely with the people
[53:28] having palm branches in their hands and
[53:31] and you know shouting and you know and
[53:34] celebrating the Romans will be around to
[53:37] find out what is happening and yes the
[53:39] people singing in multitude Blessed Be
[53:42] Our King blessed is the one that cometh
[53:45] in the name of the Lord
[53:47] praise the Lord right there uh the
[53:50] Pharisees are in trouble
[53:52] because they know exactly that the the
[53:55] the the governor is going to call them
[53:57] what is this am I hearing
[54:02] praise the Lord
[54:04] amen so this is
[54:06] can you can you quiet the people
[54:09] can you quiet the people
[54:12] Masters rebuked their disciples
[54:15] and he answered and said unto them I
[54:18] tell you that if these should hold their
[54:21] peace
[54:22] the stone who immediately cry out
[54:27] amen so in another sense Jesus is
[54:30] identifying himself with that scripture
[54:33] he's identifying himself with that entry
[54:38] this is one of the places where publicly
[54:40] he's Desiring that yes I'm I mean I I am
[54:44] the one that cometh in the name of the
[54:45] Lord
[54:47] praise the Lord
[54:49] but we will go more into death
[54:52] on Sunday now what caught my attention
[54:55] here is that I wanted to like I said I
[55:00] wanted to give some
[55:02] uh Sila moment you know like David said
[55:05] Sila in the psalm I wanted to give some
[55:08] sillac movement in uh in the message we
[55:10] were playing
[55:11] and and this caught my attention so
[55:14] let's let's take this one from uh who is
[55:17] this make you see the brother brand name
[55:19] says this year
[55:22] he said God came down
[55:26] and be
[55:27] and become flesh and die their death in
[55:31] Christ
[55:32] so that he will clean the church in
[55:37] order to get into it for Fellowship
[55:41] so God came down he took on flesh
[55:45] and die the death in Christ so that he
[55:50] could clean the church in order to get
[55:54] into it for Fellowship
[55:56] God law of Fellowship
[55:59] that's what he made the man at the first
[56:03] time fall was for Fellowship God God the
[56:08] word alone with cherubins and and notice
[56:12] now he made man and man fell so he came
[56:16] down and redeemed them because God loved
[56:21] to be worshiped
[56:23] the very word god means object of
[56:26] worship
[56:27] now so brother Branham is saying here
[56:29] that one of the reason why uh uh uh uh
[56:33] all the shadows in in Leviticus speaks
[56:37] about the sacrifice you know who are
[56:39] there in in Leviticus you know if a man
[56:43] was to touch a dead he must say he must
[56:45] he must he must stay himself away it was
[56:48] either it was either seven days or he
[56:51] can only come up in the evening time you
[56:54] know and all of those things so all of
[56:55] those things was pointing to this very
[56:58] warmthank
[57:00] praise the Lord
[57:01] which is the the sacrifice of our Lord
[57:07] God taking on flesh and uh taking the
[57:11] death on our behalf but brother Branham
[57:13] is saying here is there the reason why
[57:16] he did that
[57:17] is for him to clean the church
[57:21] now what caught my attention is that
[57:25] if you go in the scripture
[57:29] at the beginning of Jesus ministry I
[57:33] never saw this until I started studying
[57:35] this it was it caught my attention I've
[57:37] preached on this before I never thought
[57:39] the reason why I didn't see it because I
[57:42] took it all to be the sin
[57:44] in Saint John Chapter 2 Jesus
[57:47] clean the temple he whipped the people
[57:49] off
[57:50] praise the Lord
[57:52] and he says my father house is the House
[57:55] of Prayer
[57:56] but you will realize that after this
[58:00] triumphing he went straight to the
[58:03] temple and he did it a second time
[58:07] praise the Lord
[58:11] and he did it the second time let's look
[58:14] at the first one Saint John chapter 2.
[58:27] praise the Lord
[58:40] but Branham says God came down and
[58:43] become flesh and died to death in Christ
[58:46] so that he could clean the church in
[58:50] order to get into it for Fellowship
[58:53] so just just see they are just at the
[58:57] beginning of his ministry see John
[58:59] Chapter 2 will start from the third day
[59:01] there was a marriage in Canada so so so
[59:04] there he went to their wedding and after
[59:07] that
[59:09] verse 11 which says this this beginning
[59:13] the miracle
[59:15] the Miracles Jesus did so so that was at
[59:20] the beginning of his ministry but then
[59:21] you will see here verse 12 you read that
[59:25] this is after a couple days Jesus has
[59:28] gone with his Brethren and this and and
[59:31] verse 13 will now bring us to the scene
[59:33] the Bible says and the Jewish Passover
[59:36] was at hand and Jesus went up
[59:39] to Jerusalem and found in the temple
[59:43] those that sold houses and ships and
[59:45] Dove and the changes of money sitting
[59:48] and when he had made a scotch of small
[59:52] Court he drove them out of the Temple
[59:56] and uh and the Chiefs and the oxen and
[59:59] and and pour out the the changes money
[1:00:03] and overthrew the temple and said unto
[1:00:07] them that yeah overthrew the table sorry
[1:00:10] and said unto them that Soul doves
[1:00:15] take these things hints now I'll grab
[1:00:19] your attention there before we go
[1:00:21] further and dogs
[1:00:25] were
[1:00:27] were for the poor people
[1:00:31] those that could not afford to get a
[1:00:34] lamb
[1:00:35] praise the Lord you have to remember
[1:00:38] that in Luke Jesus at at his uh his
[1:00:42] dedication it was those that they
[1:00:44] brought
[1:00:47] amen amen so so reading this what caught
[1:00:51] my attention down there here you see
[1:00:53] he's he's whipping the people out the
[1:00:56] sheeps and The Oxen or running out of
[1:00:58] the place he's turning the table off and
[1:01:00] he comes here to meet these doors
[1:01:03] realizing that this was the same thing
[1:01:05] that was given for me
[1:01:09] this this this is for the least fault in
[1:01:11] it
[1:01:13] so then he spoke to them
[1:01:16] praise the Lord
[1:01:21] take these hands make now at my father
[1:01:24] house
[1:01:26] and House of merchandise then the Bible
[1:01:29] said this is the part that I love
[1:01:32] that I've preached on many times I love
[1:01:35] it the disciples remember just by seeing
[1:01:39] him doing that
[1:01:42] the law brought to their mind a
[1:01:44] scripture
[1:01:50] what David said in the psalm the Zeal of
[1:01:54] the house has eaten me up God quickened
[1:01:56] it to their heart
[1:01:58] the Bible says that disciple remember
[1:02:04] praise the Lord
[1:02:08] there it is written
[1:02:11] the Zeal of that house has eaten up
[1:02:18] praise the Lord
[1:02:21] now this is at the beginning of his
[1:02:24] ministry
[1:02:27] when you go at the end of his ministry
[1:02:29] he he never told them says my father
[1:02:32] house he's my house
[1:02:41] praise the Lord no so yeah brother
[1:02:43] Branham is making us to see here in in
[1:02:46] in in this message that's the reason why
[1:02:50] God took on flesh was to clean the
[1:02:54] temple clean his house clean the church
[1:02:57] clean the provided place of worship
[1:03:02] because he wanted to have fellowship
[1:03:04] with us what is the purpose of the
[1:03:06] preaching of the word
[1:03:08] it's a watching
[1:03:10] for what to please us
[1:03:17] to one purpose the word has only one
[1:03:21] purpose
[1:03:22] is to clean us
[1:03:27] are we together
[1:03:33] that's the reason why we cannot stay
[1:03:36] under the Fellowship of the word and
[1:03:38] still get a grip to our habits
[1:03:44] praise the Lord
[1:03:46] the word has
[1:03:48] the the the uh is it's a very powerful
[1:03:52] detergent to break any habits
[1:03:58] just like Isaiah says Lord your sin may
[1:04:02] be read as Khalid
[1:04:05] but the word can make it
[1:04:07] what I snow
[1:04:12] are we together
[1:04:14] now see your brother bran will take this
[1:04:16] awesome in a message what it takes to
[1:04:19] overcome all unbelief he will go
[1:04:23] this way and says I was looking at many
[1:04:25] of these tonight but I just choose this
[1:04:28] tool just uh for this Wednesday night
[1:04:32] he says first is Apostle Prophet teacher
[1:04:37] evangelist Pastor those five god-giving
[1:04:41] gifts in the church so each of you
[1:04:44] people who has a Godly pastor
[1:04:48] has a gift from God in your church as
[1:04:52] Shepherd pastor means as Shepherd to
[1:04:54] watch over the floor to teach them the
[1:04:57] word of God then these other nine
[1:05:01] different spiritual gifts should be
[1:05:04] operating in the church to keep the
[1:05:08] church clean
[1:05:13] praise the Lord
[1:05:15] Amen to keep the church clean
[1:05:21] now so that's what the gifts are giving
[1:05:23] for
[1:05:26] that's what again I'm talking here now
[1:05:28] he's talking about the the noun
[1:05:30] spiritual gift is missing that also with
[1:05:33] the fight for Ministry the five for
[1:05:35] Ministry cleans the church by the
[1:05:37] preaching of the word
[1:05:39] whether it's a teacher that comes in and
[1:05:41] and positionally placed Us in the word
[1:05:44] in the message
[1:05:46] when we find our position we knows
[1:05:50] how to overcome the devil
[1:05:54] amen the Bible says resist the devil and
[1:05:57] he will flee
[1:06:04] comes around and then he preached and
[1:06:07] then he he revealed he calls sins and he
[1:06:10] you know he speaks about things the only
[1:06:12] reason why God is giving us that gift is
[1:06:15] to keep his church clean
[1:06:21] now so brother Branham yet as he talks
[1:06:23] there let's let's read this let's read
[1:06:25] this uh or together finish he talks
[1:06:27] about that then these are the nine
[1:06:29] different spiritual gifts should be
[1:06:31] operating in the church to keep the
[1:06:34] church clean like the ananias and and
[1:06:38] Safari and so forth the spirit of God
[1:06:41] raised up and call somebody out to tell
[1:06:44] them they are living wrong and rebuke
[1:06:47] their sin openly and and that's what the
[1:06:51] holy spirit is in the church form to
[1:06:55] keep the church clean and ready for the
[1:06:59] coming of the Lord
[1:07:02] praise the Lord
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:09] now uh David
[1:07:11] was there no uh uh and saw because of
[1:07:16] his Disobedience he has caught a wrong
[1:07:20] Spirit an evil spirit has got on him
[1:07:22] because of his disobedience Barbarian
[1:07:25] said in rejected King he says because we
[1:07:29] are we we we are I gave in love nature
[1:07:33] when we are born again
[1:07:35] when we are born again we give our
[1:07:38] hearts to the Lord God placed Allah
[1:07:40] nature on us for us to be led he says if
[1:07:44] we refuse to be led by the spirit and
[1:07:47] not a spirit would lead us
[1:07:51] he says that is exactly what happened to
[1:07:54] Saul because he refused to follow the
[1:07:57] leadership of of Samia he got a wrong
[1:08:00] spirit
[1:08:03] and when that wrong Spirit was
[1:08:05] tormenting him
[1:08:07] what was cleansing him David music
[1:08:11] they will come and play the music
[1:08:14] now you see why brother Branham who says
[1:08:16] come to church 10 minutes before time
[1:08:19] sit under the music
[1:08:28] come to church tell the man he said
[1:08:29] under the music
[1:08:34] later just
[1:08:36] set your mind
[1:08:38] ready for worship
[1:08:42] they just calm you down
[1:08:45] ready for Fellowship
[1:08:49] because that is what that gift is
[1:08:52] therefore
[1:08:54] every gift
[1:08:56] is
[1:08:57] to cleanse the church
[1:09:03] are we together
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:11] now so brother Branham talks about the
[1:09:13] five foot Ministry we know the position
[1:09:15] of the fight for Ministry at the end of
[1:09:17] the word
[1:09:19] but then he also talks about the nice
[1:09:21] spiritual gift
[1:09:23] praise the Lord
[1:09:24] amen those gifts are for the body
[1:09:28] but you see that the danger that
[1:09:30] happened over the years with the church
[1:09:32] is the other
[1:09:34] we care so anxious for the manifestation
[1:09:37] of the supernatural that we try to
[1:09:39] manufacture it
[1:09:44] praise the Lord the gifts are there
[1:09:49] all we need to do is just create the
[1:09:51] right atmosphere
[1:09:55] praise the Lord
[1:10:04] the gifts are there you see the uh we
[1:10:07] start to pray then and then as soon as
[1:10:09] an atmosphere come on the people you see
[1:10:11] you see uh you hear other people being
[1:10:14] very loud you know and and they are
[1:10:17] saying things out that can burst into a
[1:10:20] prophecy
[1:10:21] but you don't have to manufacture it or
[1:10:25] else you could get a wrong spirit
[1:10:34] you don't have to manufacture it
[1:10:39] because the thing there is there that it
[1:10:41] is God that is working through every
[1:10:44] gift of the body
[1:10:49] praise the Lord
[1:10:51] it is God that is working through every
[1:10:54] gift of the body so I mean I was just
[1:10:56] telling on this thing trying to look
[1:10:57] into this triumphant entry and then uh
[1:11:01] uh this thing just break to my mind to
[1:11:03] see that Jesus at the beginning of his
[1:11:06] ministry
[1:11:08] he went cleaning
[1:11:11] the temple
[1:11:15] praise the Lord
[1:11:16] and before he will pay the ultimate
[1:11:19] price
[1:11:20] before he would give the sacrifice that
[1:11:23] will really bring their cleansing to
[1:11:25] bring man into fellowship with God he
[1:11:27] went back to the temple again
[1:11:31] praise the Lord
[1:11:38] and he had to clean it
[1:11:48] are we together
[1:11:51] we cannot get into Fellowship I mean
[1:11:53] right from the beginning right there in
[1:11:55] Eden when Adam felt he talked to himself
[1:11:59] a fake leaf
[1:12:01] the effect Leaf is is the it's a kind of
[1:12:05] is the best religion that we can produce
[1:12:09] a faith live is man's man's religion
[1:12:14] our best ideas when we bring our ideas
[1:12:18] uh uh in in approaching God
[1:12:22] praise the Lord
[1:12:27] hallelujah amen amen are we together
[1:12:31] I mean uh uh there is there is uh we we
[1:12:34] can we can bring our calculation we can
[1:12:37] reason you know what let's do it this
[1:12:39] way let's do it that way you can never
[1:12:41] have a better idea brother Branham
[1:12:44] shared in the church age book he said in
[1:12:47] every age he says both the clergy and
[1:12:51] the elitists go astray from God
[1:12:54] and that's the reason why God has to
[1:12:57] send a messenger in every age to bring
[1:13:00] the people back to the word
[1:13:02] our best ideas will just take us away
[1:13:06] from God except we are doing a bad the
[1:13:09] word
[1:13:13] it has to be by the word
[1:13:23] God's desire for Fellowship
[1:13:26] his Desiring Fellowship more than we
[1:13:30] desire Fellowship
[1:13:32] amen
[1:13:35] and the way that he can the way that he
[1:13:38] will be able to achieve it for us to
[1:13:41] have fellowship with God young people
[1:13:43] it's not just the service on Wednesday
[1:13:45] that are coming to church on Sunday no
[1:13:47] it's just that intimate relationship it
[1:13:51] is is that joy of the Lord in your heart
[1:13:54] the way that God speaks to you the way
[1:13:56] he leads you the way you trust him the
[1:13:59] way you you stand upon his word
[1:14:03] and God can only achieve that when he
[1:14:07] cleans us
[1:14:09] we will not come toward the fullness of
[1:14:12] Fellowship when we are stay still filled
[1:14:15] in in our own mess
[1:14:19] whatever mess we have whatever mess we
[1:14:22] are creating for ourselves whatever mess
[1:14:25] we have in comfort in
[1:14:27] you will never attain fellowship with
[1:14:30] God
[1:14:41] if Jesus did that in his effluent
[1:14:44] Ministry from the beginning of his
[1:14:46] ministry and at the end showing the
[1:14:49] Alpha and Omega principle
[1:14:54] he went right into the temple
[1:14:57] and just like how he did it
[1:15:01] you know I was I was reading uh some
[1:15:03] cold blood Brown was talking about how
[1:15:05] you know uh uh uh the Bible talks about
[1:15:08] Jesus and and the tenderness of the Lord
[1:15:12] you know the kindness the the Lord that
[1:15:14] is full of compassion but bear band was
[1:15:17] described describing how when he came
[1:15:19] down there to the temple
[1:15:24] the one that was
[1:15:26] at uh
[1:15:28] the wedding that was so quiet
[1:15:32] nobody even knew he was there
[1:15:35] he turned the water to wine was not
[1:15:38] looking for no recognition
[1:15:42] praise the Lord but when it got down to
[1:15:45] cleaning the temple
[1:15:47] when it got down to cleaning the temple
[1:15:53] it was it was a kind of a different
[1:15:55] action or different character that the
[1:15:58] disciples were seeing
[1:16:00] praise the Lord
[1:16:03] something that was never done
[1:16:14] praise the Lord
[1:16:20] he went right in there
[1:16:24] took a calling and I mean he was just he
[1:16:27] was just whipping away whatever he sees
[1:16:29] turning the tables upside down
[1:16:33] having the sheeps and the ox in
[1:16:35] everything to get out of out of the
[1:16:37] temple area
[1:16:41] praise the Lord
[1:16:50] and that is the very same things that he
[1:16:53] he do to you and myself
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:00] he will use the preaching of the word
[1:17:06] to get us clean amen
[1:17:09] amen sometimes he will use triers to get
[1:17:11] us claims
[1:17:17] especially when he's trying to to get
[1:17:19] your attention with the word
[1:17:23] and you are still playing stubborn
[1:17:27] praise the Lord
[1:17:29] it was God that was going Adam Adam
[1:17:31] where are you
[1:17:33] it was God that made the provision of
[1:17:36] the Sheep's King because he wanted to
[1:17:38] get his son back into Fellowship
[1:17:48] and God can only enjoy Fellowship
[1:17:52] when the temple is clean
[1:17:57] amen
[1:17:59] we will only be able to enjoy fellowship
[1:18:02] with the Revere word
[1:18:04] when our Temple is clinched
[1:18:09] then the word becomes sweeter on
[1:18:17] I mean you would just read the word you
[1:18:19] will have the hair knowledge of the word
[1:18:21] but you will not enjoy the fellowship
[1:18:24] that I mean the joy the fellowship that
[1:18:27] you should be able to have
[1:18:31] when you when you find that word
[1:18:33] empowering you
[1:18:38] praise the Lord
[1:18:40] you just think about it let me in there
[1:18:42] get back to brother team say when he
[1:18:44] preach on Sunday you think about it
[1:18:48] that God rest up something for the
[1:18:51] purpose
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:57] and he I mean he was born a Nazareth to
[1:19:00] destroy the Philistine and here is he
[1:19:02] there uh uh uh uh taking a joy Bond of
[1:19:07] an ox and he's killing about 300 men
[1:19:15] praise the Lord
[1:19:17] and after throwing his hands in in all
[1:19:20] of this he's tired
[1:19:23] that God
[1:19:26] would dig a well
[1:19:29] in a dry bone
[1:19:32] to be able to quench his tests
[1:19:36] he said Lord after you have given me the
[1:19:38] strength to kill this man where I die of
[1:19:41] tests and the Bible says the spirit of
[1:19:44] the Lord created a hollow
[1:19:50] now only a in the Boom
[1:20:01] praise the Lord
[1:20:03] that's when the joy of the Lord is your
[1:20:06] strength when you can see God coming in
[1:20:09] a supernatural way
[1:20:12] praise the Lord
[1:20:14] putting water in the hollow of your
[1:20:16] bones
[1:20:19] to be able to quench your text
[1:20:23] something killed a lion
[1:20:27] and he gonna win over there to the
[1:20:29] Philistines in order they had forgot
[1:20:31] about it
[1:20:33] I think that was when he took the Gate
[1:20:35] of the city on his shoulder
[1:20:37] when he brought it up the hill then
[1:20:39] throw it down he was so tired and hungry
[1:20:45] but the very lion that he killed
[1:20:49] he was able to eat honey
[1:20:53] praise the Lord Brother Brad I'm locking
[1:20:56] down to uh uh uh uh our our tough trious
[1:21:01] and and stubborn areas in our lives
[1:21:04] the prayer of God says if you can kill
[1:21:07] that you will eat honey out of it
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:11] praise the Lord because after you
[1:21:13] realize that God has delivered you from
[1:21:16] this habit or God has delivered you from
[1:21:19] a certain behavior when it comes around
[1:21:23] you will just pray so Lord
[1:21:25] because you know that it was God and
[1:21:28] Only God Alone
[1:21:33] so you see we can we we we only be able
[1:21:36] to enjoy The Fellowship of the world
[1:21:39] I mean a preacher would not have to beg
[1:21:41] you for amen he will be so fired up you
[1:21:44] will just be pulling the word out of the
[1:21:46] preacher before it comes from out of his
[1:21:48] mouth he's already in your mind I knew
[1:21:51] exactly that's why you were going to say
[1:21:55] good brother
[1:22:02] but I'm telling you I I mean I'm just
[1:22:05] being honest to you I really never saw
[1:22:07] this
[1:22:08] it just popped out of the scripture I
[1:22:10] said wow let me let me read this again
[1:22:14] because the setting is not the same
[1:22:22] join account is the beginning of his
[1:22:24] ministry
[1:22:29] and look at count years
[1:22:32] is the end of his ministry
[1:22:36] it's not the same one he says my father
[1:22:40] house is a house of prayer at the end of
[1:22:43] the his ministry he says my house
[1:22:46] will be called
[1:22:48] the House of Prayer
[1:22:54] praise the Lord
[1:22:55] amen
[1:23:04] so just that yes that yes to give us a
[1:23:07] picture of how much
[1:23:09] he want his church to be claimed
[1:23:12] how much he want our lives to be clean
[1:23:16] how much he want our homes to be clean
[1:23:27] that's what brings the Angels around
[1:23:31] praise the Lord that's what bring the
[1:23:34] gifts in the church we can have the
[1:23:36] gifts when we all mess up in our mind
[1:23:38] when we are doing things that we're not
[1:23:40] supposed to do then we said there is no
[1:23:42] gift where will the gift come from
[1:23:49] do we want people just anointed on their
[1:23:51] flesh
[1:23:55] well brother I'm seeing them one
[1:23:57] speaking in tongues one interpret
[1:23:58] interpreting an honor Vision he could
[1:24:01] see that one is living wrong
[1:24:14] the gifts are here
[1:24:18] the gifts are here
[1:24:20] okay
[1:24:22] the body
[1:24:23] brother Branham shared the scripture
[1:24:25] make us to know God placed those gifts
[1:24:28] in his body
[1:24:30] if this is the body of the Lord the
[1:24:32] gifts are here the people just have to
[1:24:35] be right
[1:24:37] we don't have to make it up
[1:24:42] praise the lord we don't have to
[1:24:44] fabricate prophecies
[1:24:46] and we flawed it will come right
[1:24:51] it would come by the words
[1:24:57] it won't be a premeditated gossip
[1:25:02] praise the Lord
[1:25:04] it will not be a premeditated gossip it
[1:25:06] would come flowing from the word
[1:25:17] the gifts will always be in part they
[1:25:20] will never be in fold
[1:25:22] until the church is clean
[1:25:26] until the people get away from Gossip
[1:25:28] from forces from all of those things it
[1:25:31] will just be in part
[1:25:37] dreams will be in part
[1:25:40] prophecy will be in part understanding
[1:25:43] will be in part
[1:25:53] for us to enjoy The Fellowship of the
[1:25:56] word feel the presence of the Angels
[1:26:12] we have to allow the world to cleanse us
[1:26:15] we have to take the word
[1:26:18] amen
[1:26:20] and all preacher used to say first John
[1:26:24] chapter one let's go there he says this
[1:26:27] is the Christian bar of soap
[1:26:30] he called it a Christian bottle soap
[1:26:33] thank you
[1:26:39] are we together
[1:26:47] okay
[1:27:04] first John chapter 1 verse 3 verse 6.
[1:27:08] and we find a place to close here and
[1:27:10] just go to the Lord
[1:27:15] this kind of caught my attention like I
[1:27:17] said I mean when the world pops out like
[1:27:21] that and I mean nothing else everything
[1:27:23] goes away from my head
[1:27:25] if I don't preach it I would just I
[1:27:27] would just I would just come and stand
[1:27:29] like a fool before you because I'm
[1:27:31] saying wow oh my God
[1:27:33] oh man I'm seeing this thing
[1:27:37] you mean he's big at the beginning of
[1:27:40] his ministry
[1:27:43] and also at the end of his ministry
[1:27:48] he went right out in there and says this
[1:27:51] house is the House of Prayer
[1:27:57] this house should be called The House of
[1:28:00] Prayer
[1:28:05] whether we are in a crime room whether
[1:28:07] we are in the bathroom whether we are in
[1:28:09] the office we must know that this house
[1:28:12] is the House of Prayer
[1:28:22] are we together
[1:28:32] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:28:35] him and walk in darkness we lied and do
[1:28:38] not the truth
[1:28:40] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:28:44] the light we have Fellowship one with
[1:28:46] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:28:48] cleans us from all sin
[1:28:52] praise the Lord
[1:28:54] amen that's how we get our cleansing
[1:28:56] when we walk in the light how do we walk
[1:28:59] in the light by applying the word to our
[1:29:01] everydays
[1:29:04] but Brandon said is just like the old
[1:29:07] man going there up the hill uh the the
[1:29:09] fellow asks him how will you get there
[1:29:11] he says I have this lamb before me your
[1:29:14] word is alarm before me
[1:29:17] he says I have this lamb before me it
[1:29:20] will clear the path as I take one step
[1:29:22] to go that's how we apply the word
[1:29:25] what did the word says what did the
[1:29:28] scripture says
[1:29:29] about this what did the message what is
[1:29:32] the messenger said about this
[1:29:35] their desire that habit of going back to
[1:29:38] the word
[1:29:41] you are in Fellowship
[1:29:44] you are walking in the light as he is in
[1:29:47] the light
[1:29:51] you are having that confidence that you
[1:29:53] are not just guessing your choices
[1:29:57] you are not guessing your choices but
[1:29:59] you are bringing it back to the word
[1:30:05] you are not doing things because you
[1:30:07] want you are yeah and make me feel good
[1:30:10] praise the Lord
[1:30:12] are you conscious what a God is feeling
[1:30:13] good about it
[1:30:25] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:30:27] light we have Fellowship one with
[1:30:29] another the blood cleans us but Branham
[1:30:32] says is uh is constant atuming
[1:30:36] he says his constant atonement is almost
[1:30:38] like when God Rob Adam and Eve in the sh
[1:30:42] in in the bloody skin as they were
[1:30:44] walking he says the blood was dropping
[1:30:46] so as we walk in the light as you apply
[1:30:49] the word
[1:30:50] you're having access to the blood
[1:30:55] amen
[1:30:57] as we walk in the light
[1:31:01] it's not uh it's not this uh uh uh uh
[1:31:05] you know uh how what we would say is a
[1:31:08] Pentecostal gibberish
[1:31:10] the blood of Jesus
[1:31:13] I wash myself in the blood of Jesus
[1:31:18] one by your very action you are defying
[1:31:21] the word
[1:31:25] we just have the blood of Jesus on our
[1:31:27] left the blood of Jesus I wash my house
[1:31:29] in the blood of Jesus Christ when you
[1:31:30] have all sorts of filthy things all over
[1:31:32] your house
[1:31:35] you're using another Blood not this word
[1:31:37] not this Blood
[1:31:40] not this bleeding word
[1:31:46] it is not just a saying it's not a
[1:31:48] slogan
[1:31:50] you we can only have access to the blood
[1:31:53] when we walk in the light
[1:32:00] if the if the chemical blood of Jesus
[1:32:03] Christ was here for you in a bottle for
[1:32:05] you to drink it you get sick
[1:32:08] why because the life left that blood
[1:32:14] praise the Lord
[1:32:16] the life left that blood it came back on
[1:32:19] the days of Pentecost
[1:32:23] so the life is in the word
[1:32:27] applying the word
[1:32:30] to our sickness you are applying the
[1:32:32] blood applying the word to our mistakes
[1:32:35] you are applying the blood
[1:32:38] applying the word to our sin you are
[1:32:40] applying the blood
[1:32:47] so we have a constant atuming
[1:32:51] praise the Lord
[1:32:53] when the devil brings a thought to your
[1:32:55] mind and you know that it's not a good
[1:32:56] thought you can get access to that blood
[1:32:59] immediately Why by casting it out of
[1:33:02] your mind Satan I rebuke you in Jesus
[1:33:04] name
[1:33:06] Lord cleansed my mind from that filter
[1:33:08] you have an access to the blood
[1:33:19] are we together now he goes on he says
[1:33:23] if we say verse 8 that we have no sin we
[1:33:26] deceive ourself the truth is not in us
[1:33:29] but if we confess our sin he is faithful
[1:33:32] and just to forgive us of our sin and to
[1:33:35] do what
[1:33:37] cleanse
[1:33:39] cleanse
[1:33:43] they'll find in the least opportunity to
[1:33:46] make use of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:33:50] finding the least opportunity that you
[1:33:53] have
[1:33:54] when you are wrong right there I'm sorry
[1:33:56] I'm wrong
[1:33:58] forgive me
[1:34:02] but what we try to do is that we try to
[1:34:05] find a way to justify it
[1:34:07] we Justified and and then and what we're
[1:34:10] doing is that we're cooking condemnation
[1:34:12] in our heart
[1:34:15] finding a way to make ourselves stubborn
[1:34:17] to go back and do it again
[1:34:26] when we can find a quick asset right
[1:34:29] there and then
[1:34:34] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not supposed to
[1:34:36] do that I'm very sorry please forgive me
[1:34:40] right out of her Earnest heart
[1:34:43] when you do an earnestly and write you
[1:34:45] give yourself access to the blood
[1:34:49] and I will tell you you know what it is
[1:34:51] you get a good feeling
[1:34:55] praise the Lord when you don't do it
[1:34:57] right also you don't get a good feeling
[1:35:02] because you cannot say you are sorry
[1:35:04] then you come back again and start
[1:35:05] defending yourself
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:09] and arguing about it
[1:35:19] praise the Lord
[1:35:22] someone says I'm sorry he said no you
[1:35:24] are not sorry
[1:35:26] I know you are not sorry I say I'm very
[1:35:29] sorry no no you are not sorry
[1:35:31] you are not sorry
[1:35:34] praise the Lord you know what is
[1:35:36] happening there is that you are you are
[1:35:39] you are having access to the blood and
[1:35:41] the next person is refusing the blood
[1:35:45] praise the Lord because they want to
[1:35:47] take up their issue they want to make it
[1:35:49] an issue
[1:35:59] it's a constant atomic
[1:36:04] we are rap in the same bleeding skin
[1:36:08] that Adam and Eve
[1:36:10] when God called every son he wrapped Us
[1:36:13] in that bleeding skin
[1:36:16] and as we are walking
[1:36:19] the blood is dropping
[1:36:21] and every time it drops it's making a
[1:36:24] tumoring for us
[1:36:26] praise the Lord
[1:36:29] amen
[1:36:30] every time you drop it making a stomach
[1:36:32] for us and it's speaking better things
[1:36:34] before the father
[1:36:38] is speaking better things that's the
[1:36:40] reason why when we come approaching God
[1:36:43] on the business of his word
[1:36:50] go hear that language of his word
[1:36:54] more than our vocabulary and verb and
[1:36:57] our verb and all of that
[1:36:59] praise the Lord
[1:37:05] but that's where my my thought was
[1:37:07] tonight

[1:37:38] when we are allowing the word to cleanse
