========================================

[Music] [Music] Daltry I'm speaking of the natural now to type it with the spiritual if this woman would commit such a sin then she is more an adulteress if she has two living husbands at the same time therefore she has sparked at it by doing this her rights to God and heaven by doing so much she sure has she is an outcast from the economy of God according to the Scriptures and I've just read so is the church when she tries to mix creed and denomination with the Word of God she can't be married to a denomination the others I'm all set so here plenty of oils and God's Word and that's his law Paul speaking the same thing here she cannot be married to a church of worthy Creed and be the Bride of Christ because she one is contrary to them I remember say what we believe this but we don't believe that if you're married to Christ Christ is the word of God in st. John the first chapter said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God and the same was made flesh into all the movement Christ was the Living Word he always was the word he's still the word she always will be the word he was only the manifestation of the attributes of God for he was the son of God in any son is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the bedding grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the earth and become in the image of your father then we can fellowship with you and so you sons of God and daughters of God before there even for you are only the physical manifestations of the attributes that was in God at the beginning or there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know us at about it didn't you know when yours in your earthly father but you're a manifested in his image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship of God and therefore as short as your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual James had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world no way around it's right now now we notice that life being in you God life being in you from the foundation of the world now now you cannot mix denomination greed with the word becauseyou're - contrary one to the other that's exactly what Satan tried to do with his intellectual conceptions to eat he said he admitted that God said it but it said surely you'll not die see and they believed that and that's what Creed has done tonight denomination that separated the people from the Word of God didn't Jesus say when he comes you through your traditions have made the commandments of God of no effect to the people that you are free we have dissociated the fellowship of the holy spirit to anoint the Word of God that's laced out for this generation we have separated the people so far denomination that they cannot have a chance to see it now God here every generation he has a new part of his book and all goes together like my body was built I'm told to start in the spine where wasn't all spine it went from that to ribs and from lungs into hands and arms and feet and so forth and come on out to be the person that I am and so was a God manifested in the beginning and finally he was appear to Jehovah God the Father then he appeared as God the Son in Jesus Christ knives appeared has got the Holy Ghost the same God all the time three manifestations of the same same God now we find in this as each generation God has lauded his word from the beginning just like evolution team just like first thing God created probably was let's say created bhakti life first then he created animal life next then he created human life next time an evolution rising higher so has it been in God in his church justification hunter Luther Satan has pulling his bride out now he's creating his bride justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley and so forth he's the evolution of the Spirit being given more and more calls a body is building coming to the head which is Christ the body of Christ now she as a woman if she is married to Christ the word she cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time for she's bound by she shall cannot live with both husbands at the same time their country wanted her one is God fancy other than his man-made so they're contrary said let every man's word be alive mind be the truth God said it just as much contrary to one another as law was to Greece as Paul speaking up here one must be dead to have the other any of she tries to mix them she shall be called an adulteress Oh think of it New York Arizona across the nation think of it God said if she's tried to be married to two at the same time she shall be called in a darkness what adult earnest can enter heaven with God marry an adult earnest certainly not yes us not to do it she shall be called an adulteress then her children if she is an adulteress her children is illegitimate illegitimate illegitimate Awad not to the church but to the word she's illegitimate what a teacher office revelation three here all the last day lady or CEO churches what an illegitimate group what denomination mixer lukewarm yes carry on and Colin sells Christians and deny the word of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof as the Prophet said they would be marriage is the oldest institution in the world marriage was performed first and instituted in the Garden of Eden a woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not the bow a woman is trusted that there's not a preacher on earth like a woman there's no female doll there's no female of any time and trusted with the character that a woman is a woman but not even in the the beginning of the creation because God know that she'd fall all other females could not commit adultery she's the only one that can commit adultery if she been they like the original that within this complementary to God's great wisdom see she was made a byproduct of a man but because she was cast over in that side she is also been given a sacred charge from God for redemption she's got characters that she must not defy if she wouldn't my damn she's the file for lifetime no matter how much she's forgiven she can't be justified I'll strike that a little bit got it scriptural next a few minutes she can be forgiven for her development but she cannot be justified in this life it's always with her notice now she's been given it she may be forgiven but not justified her body is given to her a sacred trust from God no female dog no bird no other animal nor the creature like that no she's the only one by it she is the reason so sacred she is the bring forth life engineer her body is the bedding grounds of life therefore that's reason she's given this sacred trust now here's what you may disagree many of you delusions that's what they file the whole human race is that adultery at the beginning [Applause] her bedding ground was March she brought forth those twins Cain and Abel one act two children search the scriptures notice now we find that her body is a Betty grounds and therefore it's a sacred trust not to defile it now I'm speaking out bringing this to an illustration to show you were the church things I'm not speaking of you women whatever you are that's between you and God who you man but I'm speaking out the church and right now this she has given to bring forth life but only God Himself can give her husband might be the germ bear but God has produced life this right it has to come all life has to come from God any eye has to come from God it's perverted that's what makes it sinful but life has to come from God he's the author of life now she has a sick one all to name three things sure that she must not get away from now I'm speaking to keep the church in mind while I'm speaking this to the natural woman is Paul is here in seventh chapter Romans she has a sacred trust of virtue committed to her by her Lord a certain virtue nothing else holds it but a woman trying that's committed to her by God she must not defile that virtue if she even does something wrong she must confess that to her husband before she takes and make a righteous saying to the church at his marriages the law has to come also before crying before the second marriage she has confessed that if she doesn't and she lives with her husband 14 years and then confessing he has a right to far away and marry another woman that's the scripture fornications unclean living Joseph fear not tickity million died wife for that which she conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost he was my ta put her away privately she had already engaged her when you engaged her as far as God's concerned you're married to her notice now she has a sacred trust of virtue it's been given her trusted to hurt by the law God gave her that virtue just as it was in the Garden of Eden she say yes or no she has a sacred trust of womanhood committed to her but she must not break the womanhood I'm speaking of here is her conduct her character around man nothing every man looks on these screens and see these movie stars kissing and hugging is slopping around all these women a woman does that is of a bad character she might be purchase otherwise but see in her heart when those gland sex glands are in the lips the man kisses a woman is actually pretentiously committed adultery six glands are in the woman's lips and a man's lips he could kiss her on the hand it was mixing their six days but the sex panja's in the lips you see all this nonsense endure the Hollywood today of all this and slopping and loving around with women and so forth and little girls look at all that no wonder our morals are rock [Applause] the cause is cut before the children try it it has to be that way for the last days now keep the church in mind she's kissing us swapping it and everything else but let the devil in education and scientific churches and so forth once scientific education everything is absolutely contrary to God the whole system of civilization we have now is absolutely antichrist educational system is Antichrist civilization is Antichrist it's against God you say a gift civilization God will have a civilization one of these days that won't have any death associated into it this modern civilization come by Satan a preventive Lord willing tonight how the Bible all these things are of Satan our new civilization I have none of this in it she has this secret womanhood no wonder that man act around women the way they do is because women act around man the way they do she characters herself out you're the parish shorts on and skin tighten man's pulling and thanks out on strings twisting around no matter what she says she might be as birches to her husband she could be but it is sight of God she is a darkness whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart did she present herself to be that nuts exactly what the church is done with the world notice that's committer sacred virtue sacred womanhood and then sacred motherhood honor her husband just look today in certain cities many cities they even have big parties in what called society church members to death their hats and a floor and they all get drunk pitcher keys into it each woman goes and picks the key out of the head for the man she lived with over the weekend all kinds of such parties which I've got some to say your floor footing I haven't got time to go into it touch a bill and the church is just as bad right committing adultery with everything she has no business to be going into she should stay with the world buildings are all right hospitals are all right all these other things are all right educational programs that's all right we have to live your hep Reid ride that's one of the economies like we weren't supposed to put on any clothes just the beginning I'll preach on that later this week the Lord willing but we have to wear clothes because God gave us clues but in the beginning we didn't need them we were veiled now she's veiled your sin she don't even know she sinner yes she was then father now she's bayeux by the devil that she was veiled by God the difference of it now we find out that she's been given this sacred trust that she must not break a womanhood at have her character raise her children be honorable to her husband nowadays they pay a bit more attention to it and nothing in the world you're sitting office sometimes and see man bringing their wives where they try to get right with God and confess of all the man they live with and everything else ends have been married oh you say that's there are Pentecostal the others will come so it's I'm speaking up how I can get away what do you get to mix it up with the world and the church and all the fashions and things that we have we're no more like the original Pentecost was and day is from night we've drifted off somewhere here's some dark chaos somewhere and lost what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman ah see why she the type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her mother your virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to pare into the word into Christ just as same as a wool and as a woman drifts off with another man when the church goes off on these institutional programs and building programs and schools and so forth I have nothing against them here all right they serve their purpose but they're not jesus never saycome excuse preach the word that's where they neglected god make it institutions hospitals and so forth ends all right but that's not the church's duty Oh their duty is to preach the gospel but we've done everything else but that and we've drifted in just like Satan didn't mix it up with some gospel something else and something else just got a conglomeration of nothing yeah corruption even our hope the whole world what's the trend of the world reading Reader's Digest you're no longer work young girls are going to the menopause and man the cheese applies between 20 and 25 years old they're going to the middle age corruption why not because of scientific research of food and stuff that's broke down from the natural things we should put in our body we are nothing but a bunch of dying corruption now that's what the church is also hey - the same condition she's a type she has the same precious virtues by spirit given to her to preserve the spirit and the word and never commit adultery with anything in the world read a state birch it to the word as the woman is to say purchase to her husband it's a sacred trust to honor their large word above every man made great wisdom denomination there is the church's giving our trust given they say without my church I don't care what's your church means if it's contrary to the Word of God stay away from the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever mark 16 said these signs shall follow them a bleeder the church breach is different from that don't you you doubted that thing be barred to get into the Word of God do you to all the world I preach the gospel to every creature that's how poor it was to go these signs shall follow them that believe in all the world and every creature that will believe yeah see how we got away from it sure but she's responsible apart but now look what Hollywood has took the virtuous thanks from our women and said you're looking at Nero woman set your schraeder many of the women here back to sister more over here the older women that remembers a few years ago if their mother or even their would have walked out on the streets way some of these women walked a church members there are lots of woman up for being insane she forgot to put on her skirt well they was insane then it's insane now well if the whole world proves that's insane look at the murders and things that's going on now in the world insanity the whole thing is coming to fulfill revelations you may get to it this week one of those hideous things I'm not natural that spiritual things that make people scream for the rocks to the mountains and everything else to follow the complete total insanity this world are going to rot away it's almost there now well you see the footsteps of it there it is it's marching right out on the street right down the church pew total insanity the things that a human being wouldn't think of doing you being civilized look what Hollywood's done to the woman look hey it's Rob the sacred virtues of the woman on and all week ago hear all this she lost how did she do it because there was a subtle instrument called the church like to water the garden even a subtle person the devil walked into the church should I get into the Garden of Eden and deceived her into it she's the see the woman say she don't mean to be wrong II didn't mean to do wrong it wasn't will flee but she's the Bible said in second Timothy first Timothy three she was deceived in the siege is not when you willfully do this when you're deceived into doing it and that's just exactly what's happened today she's been deceived by television by magazines but these people these all these fine thinkit's are going out on the street moderate girls they look at magazines in a look at pictures you look on the street they see the clothing in the shops how Satan that great instrument of death of hell has come down amongst the people and deceived him into these things and the woman thinks she's alright if she didn't don't know it she's far from God yeah she lost all this house said leave us today I want you to notice Jesus spoke of it also if you'd like to read it Jesus made Mitch it this thing would come to pass did you know that in his
