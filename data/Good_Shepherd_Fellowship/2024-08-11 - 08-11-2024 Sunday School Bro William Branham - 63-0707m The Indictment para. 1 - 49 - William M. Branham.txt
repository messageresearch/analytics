cluster of sunshine within we thank thee for this the Heavenly Sunshine around our hearts how we thank thee for it now that thy people has just lifted their hands in this Con congregation that they

everywhere people sick suffering phone call Long Distance about 50 a day oh God what shall we do just lead us Lord we we don't know which way to go or what to do but th thou can direct these things and we pray that you'll Grant it to us because it's It's Our intention Lord what life that we have on Earth is given to us by thee and we want to use it to honor thee by uh you guide us in those things father bless us today as we've assembled together to hear the word of the Lord to sing the songs to offer prayer hear our prayers Joy with us in our songs and speak to us through the word or we ask to in Jesus name amen amen be seated I just don't know any place that I would deem uh to be a greater privilege to stand than it would be to stand in the in the pull pit to break the bread of life to waiting hungry thirsting people and this is a great privilege first I'd like to ask if if any of the right family is your have or Arville or any hadie is Arville with you Haddie um ask him if You' come to the house immediately what I told him you know uh drop by the house if we can I forgot to bring it down with me this morning something for the little doggy they got down there so I'm uh just if you will just drive right by the house as you leave out for for your Ser uh after service and now Edith uh haddy's sister that we know is a little girl that's been been crippled up since she was a baby and she's a woman now and she's in very bad shape now uh about a year ago I went down there when she had her first spell and immediately I found what her trouble was by the help and grace of God now really what's the trouble with a child she's setting her limbs hip together and she can't even move them apart it's because of the tremendous pressure on um the the nerve system but what it is there's nothing physically wrong with the child outside the Affliction of infantile Paralis when she was about 6 months old she screamed and cried all over her life nearly till we prayed for her many years ago and and she's been happy ever since until about a year ago and now it's really menopause in other words the changing of her life and her nerves are in such a tremendous condition and the little lady has got on her mind that she's dying she she's just not going to live just from one hour to the other and you know healthy strong women have terrible times sometime I have to take shots of Harmon and and go into the institutions and take shock treatments and everything during that time the human being has two changes of Life they have the change from a boy to a man from a woman from a girl to a woman about 16 17 years old they get like a bunch of just fly benites and and uh if you can just suffer with him during that age I got a daughter in that age right now Rebecca pray for her and uh Billy all every one of us we come through that little frantic age and uh and so we must suffer with them realizing it's something that that they they have to go through now Edith that this changing of of the of the seven years every seven years your life changes so the seven time seven you see it and it's makes it kind of hard that's a complete change and it it bothers the women man usually get U Kind of a Funny carrying on doing that time and sometimes leave their wives but women are are unfertile after that and we all go through that we must remember that it's things that we must bear with one another and understand those things and little Edith has gotten this condition and she's lost much weight and she looks bad and and I tell you uh some night not all of you together but just a little trip now they set up with her day and night and a little trip down there from this Tabernacle and and the different Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles here some of you people go down and see the right family I'm sure they'd appreciate it just go down sit with them a little while talk to them shake their hand and if no more than a little friendly visit we we forget that's so easy you know and when it comes to our own home then we appreciate it and we must remember others appreciate it too and uh the right family I'm sure would appreciate that I I know you would have done it if you know this condition existed but you didn't know it so there therefore uh I was telling you this morning for go and visit the right family and try to cheer Edith up don't don't tell her she looks bad tell her she looks good she go be fine she'll be all right if we just keep holding on for that's what we're here for she's our sister and and we're here to hold on in these times for that child it's like I want somebody to hold for me and pray while I was going through my trials and you want somebody for yours and and the right family has been a a long one of the oldest members that comes to this Gathering that I guess and brother Roy Slaughter and sister Slaughter I seen him just a few minuts ago waved at him when they come in thought myself as I drove around the corner how many years have I seen brother and sister Slaughter take their place in this church through the ups and downs and still waving on the Nite family and like that you appreciate those people you see and let's let's show our appreciations to them now uh today I got a long message it's a on an indictment and uh and then tonight I hear these communion and um foot wash and so forth so the pastor will speak and we'll have we'll come down and if you if you're around come and enjoy the the message from the pastor from the Lord and then also from uh the foot washing and the and the communion tonight it's be a a real heavy packed night so we'd be glad to have you if you have no other place to go and we want to appreciate appreciate Don ruddle and um and our brother and brother Jackson and and these Brethren are our brother sister churches it's uh Associated brother Jack Palmer over here who keeps the the group down in Georgia and we we we want to appreciate these men with all of our heart for times when we have Services when I come in and U they come to visit us and we appreciate I see this morning my good friend uh Dr Lee Vil and his wife I recognize sister Veil there first and I kept looking around and see where brother Lee was and uh I got a what the old southern expression a crow to pick with him see whenever guy I looked for him every day at that convention to be down there to help me out and I said well if Lee comes have in preach and I'll just make prayer for the sick and we paged him and everything else and never could find him so um um I got the crow to pick with him when I get to and uh we're glad to have brother and sister veil in this morning and maybe there's many more here we don't understand I see a sister here I believe from Chicago I can't I know the group here but I just can't call their names exactly so we we appreciate from everywhere wherever you are I see the Brethren here two young fellow is to be ordained young in the ministry at least this morning to uh our colored Brethren from up in New York has just received their credentials through the Philadelphia church and uh give in this church as where they come from and we're going to lay hands upon them that God will bless her Ministry in New York we got two or three little churches up there I believe brother Delino has a one of the little groups there and we are we appreciate them and and here's two more going out now to make uh have services for the people there and we're we appreciate these things the Lord bless you richly so many I look around see different ones that you just can't call all their names but I know that he understands now I believe if our sister The Pianist or one of them that come here and play for us when the coal of fire had touched the prophet making him as pure as pure can be when the word of voice of God said who will go for us then he answered here am I send me when we ordain these ministers by laying on of hands now we realize that the scriptural way of ordaining a minister is laying on of hands I think that's where our line Brethren are the Battleford people and so forth got mixed up and when they seen that laying on of hands to impart spiritual gifts now we do not believe that gifts comes by laying on of hands we believe that a laying on of hands is a sanction to what we've already seen it's a amen now when they lay hands upon Timothy and upon those Brethren they had noticed in them man was the gift remember stir up that gift which was in you come from your grand grandmother Lois and they seen this in Timothy and therefore the elders laid hands upon him ordaining him not put hands upon a man that nothing has ever been showed forth you see and they just ask the blessings and we all believe that so we don't impart spiritual gifts we only recognize them and lay hands upon them to sanction them that we believe that God has done such things for the people uh notice this morning way back in the back brother mckenny uh from I believe it's Kenny or mckenny the Methodist Minister sitting back there it's just recently been ordained here too I believe that was right from the platform fora whole forth up in Ohio with brother da and sister da and the group from up and all how oh when we all gather together these little places coming together it's wonderful no denomination no ties of nothing but only Jesus Christ that's all just sting together in Heavenly places all right sister if you give us let's just sing this one verse of that when the coal of fire had touched the prophet let's sing it together now when the coal of fire had touched the prophet making him as pure as pure could be when the voice of God said who go for us then he answered I send me speak my Lord speak my Lord our Brethren will come forth if you will can I'll be quick to let the other minister Brothers come forth if they will it's going to lay hands up on Lord Associates of the Tabernacle here brother rdle brother them and now and I will answer Lord

fields and across the world preaching this unsearchable Riches of Jesus Christ where so needy so needy the world is today now so much of these good things we just have to take a little here and a little there in order to get it all in the service this morning now today we are I'm speaking upon a subject that I I sometimes don't like to approach these real terrific uh times now last Sunday if some of you wasn't here and and didn't get the message of the Third Exodus and if you like the tapes I believe you'll enjoy that one the Third Exodus uh what we got a sick boy here or something oh a little boy God bless him next all right just the end the service we go pray for the sick anyhow you see so we now uh we are we ask you maybe if you can to get the message on the Third Exodus the third time that the uh light the angel of the Lord that has called the people to an exodus has visibly showed itself on Earth in an exodus I think that's real outstanding to me the Third Exodus would you care if I took off my coat they um it's awfully warm in the Tabernacle this morning and the only air conditioner we have is is what you can fan you have to generate your own power so we are planning on someday putting a cool system in here as soon as we can get things fixed now we would appreciate if you uh if you like to hear the message the Third Exodus now we've had many Exodus but we can definitely put our hand on the place time of three Exodus that God in the form of a pillar of fire has come down to call all and separate people amen now not it's separating of people and we find out that when he called his first Exodus he went before them in a pillar of fire and led them to Leading them to a land where later he appeared before them in a form of a man called Jesus Christ he come from God and went to God and the that he was rejected and he come then to call a people out out of a out of a formal condition if they got into like they had down in Egypt to give away to sin and to the the ways of the Egyptians and God called them out and now we find the second time they give away under captivity to a Roman Empire and they got off in the Creeds and got away from the real sincerity of the worshiping God again sent another Exodus uh the he appeared in the form of a man that led man in the first Exodus he was a pillar of fire then when he came on Earth in the land to where he led them what a beautiful type it'll be in the Millennium where he's leading the church now we shall see him as he is we'll have a body like his own glorious body and today by the Light of the gospel reflecting from a light a pillar a far visibly Among Us science has seen it it's in the magazines and across the world and it's both scientifically and spiritually recognized as the same Pillar of Fire by the same signs and same things that did always amen and now in the midst of days when there's a lot of fanaticism and things yet God always identifies himself now we find this and what a glorious thing it is to know that this Earthly Tabernacle someday this old frail body that we're sick and Afflicted in will be changed and made like un his own glorious body then we shall see him as he is and be with him in the land that we're Bound for today oh almost make us feel like standing and singing I'm Bound for the promise land they probably be singing at the baptismal service anyhow cuz that's our baptismal song now [Music]
