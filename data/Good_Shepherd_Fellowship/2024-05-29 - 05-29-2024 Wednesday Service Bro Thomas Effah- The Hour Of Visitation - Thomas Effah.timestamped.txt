[35:10] good to be in the house of the Lord I
[35:12] want to read uh there in St John chapter
[35:14] 3 that was where I would preach a r from
[35:17] on
[35:18] Sunday like I said I will have made uh
[35:21] some comments after the service tonight
[35:24] actually I won't be preaching brother
[35:26] brother Thomas will be speaking for us
[35:29] uh on this Wednesday night I just want
[35:31] to read few verses here before our
[35:33] brother come up he came from
[35:42] Vancouver he start to to see us and then
[35:46] he'll be flying out tomorrow
[35:49] so this time just to come and bring the
[35:52] word and and just greet Us Praise the
[35:54] Lord so uh uh brother brother uh
[35:58] uh Paul was speaking on U Sunday talking
[36:03] about walking in the
[36:04] Supernatural and uh uh you know you you
[36:08] get visiting preachers in to to preach
[36:11] you give them the Liberty to preach what
[36:12] is on their heart praise the Lord and uh
[36:16] you know and then we expect that uh as
[36:18] we grow in the Lord we will be able to
[36:21] discern the words amen discern the words
[36:24] sometimes uh you know preacher gets into
[36:27] be a Channel of inspiration and you know
[36:30] they just preach they rebuke they
[36:31] correct they say things but you have to
[36:33] discern what the holy spirit is saying
[36:35] to the church amen and uh and that uh uh
[36:40] uh you know that uh take offense in in
[36:43] the preaching of the word so uh uh but
[36:47] something uh I Tau on that I will I will
[36:50] remind us of uh when we when we come
[36:53] back uh to this to this subject we know
[36:56] that this is uh is
[37:00] uh this in John chapter 3 was one of the
[37:05] time that Jesus ever preached his major
[37:10] Doctrine St John chapter 3 was a major
[37:14] doctrine that Jesus spoke on and you
[37:18] know what is beautiful about this
[37:21] chapter as I read
[37:23] it and uh uh Jesus never preached this
[37:27] in the synagogues he never preach it to
[37:31] the
[37:32] leat he preach it to the
[37:35] preacher praise the Lord because if
[37:38] there is ever a people that need to be
[37:40] born again is we
[37:43] preachers praise the Lord he was talking
[37:46] to Nicodemus he was he was a ruler he
[37:49] was uh uh uh the leader of the people
[37:52] the ruler of the Jews he said except a
[37:55] man be born again he cannot see the
[37:58] kingdom of uh of God verse four
[38:02] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man uh
[38:05] uh uh said unto him how can a man be
[38:08] born when he is old can he enter you see
[38:12] that is one of the hardest thing you
[38:14] know to be able to come out of a system
[38:18] to be able to come out of tradition
[38:20] praise the Lord amen coming out is one
[38:24] thing but having that thing to come out
[38:26] of us is another thing
[38:28] praise the Lord Nicodemus first mind was
[38:32] going back into the wom going back into
[38:36] his traditional wom going back into uh
[38:40] uh his Pharisee womb but this is what
[38:44] that is that is uh that is uh uh amazing
[38:48] in the in the chapter here that I wanted
[38:51] to show to you because like I said Jesus
[38:55] Jesus uh this was a major doctrine that
[38:59] he uh that he spoke of and uh uh he he
[39:05] actually
[39:07] interpret what the new birth
[39:10] is praise the Lord he actually taugh us
[39:15] what a new birth
[39:17] is and he will say
[39:25] year uh in verse 11 he says uh uh verily
[39:29] I said unto you uh verily verily I say
[39:33] unto the we speak that which we do know
[39:36] and testify that which we have seen and
[39:39] have
[39:40] received uh uh and yet receive not our
[39:44] witness if I have told you everything
[39:47] things you and yeah believe not how
[39:51] shall ye believe if I tell you Heavenly
[39:54] things no man listen to this now no man
[40:00] have ascended up to
[40:02] heaven but he that came down from
[40:07] heaven even the son of man which is in
[40:12] heaven that's the new
[40:18] birth praise the Lord that is the New
[40:22] Birth the church has tried to interpret
[40:25] the new birth as conforming we believe
[40:29] this you know when you dress like us
[40:31] when you when you do this like us when
[40:33] you confess this like us Jesus talking
[40:37] about the new birth year he interprets
[40:40] what the new birth is I read that again
[40:44] no man have ascended up to heaven but he
[40:49] that came down from heaven praise the
[40:53] Lord is a birth from above
[40:58] amen praise the lord it's a birth that
[41:01] identify us with our
[41:04] Tani which is our our our original man
[41:09] praise the Lord hallelujah no man ha
[41:13] ascended up to heaven but he that came
[41:17] down from heaven even the son of man
[41:20] while he's on
[41:22] Earth why he standing there on Earth he
[41:25] said even the son of man
[41:28] which is in
[41:30] heaven praise the Lord so you see it's
[41:33] it's a supernatural
[41:36] life that's why Paul would say we are in
[41:39] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what put
[41:43] us there is that new
[41:46] birth it makes the believer has a doal
[41:51] life amen he's on Earth but yet he's in
[41:56] heaven
[42:00] that's what the new birth is the new
[42:03] birth is not joining
[42:06] church it's not even believing that
[42:08] brother brandham is a prophet it's not
[42:11] being baptized in Jesus
[42:15] name the new
[42:17] birth is a son of man is a Son of God is
[42:21] a daughter of
[42:24] God Amen it's a daughter of God is a Son
[42:28] of
[42:29] God that while they are yet on Heaven
[42:32] yet on
[42:33] Earth there is a Heavenly
[42:37] po there is a Heavenly
[42:39] influence there is a Heavenly
[42:43] desire praise the
[42:44] Lord there is a Heavenly control on
[42:48] their
[42:51] life son of man here on in Earth but yet
[42:55] in heaven amen
[42:59] that's why he said he that is born of
[43:01] the flesh is flesh he that is born eff
[43:05] is eff and he that is born Heavenly is
[43:14] Heavenly praise the
[43:16] Lord so I pray that uh we will not take
[43:20] all the time of the preacher tonight but
[43:22] I pray that uh uh uh we will we will
[43:25] realize and identify that that uh there
[43:29] there is a Heavenly
[43:31] p on the life of a
[43:33] Believer amen it's a Heavenly p on the
[43:37] life of the believer while we are here
[43:41] uh uh on Earth while we are here uh we
[43:45] have to go to work we have to go to
[43:47] school and we have to you know go to the
[43:50] grocery make our choices clean you know
[43:53] everything that we have to do because
[43:54] you see we really don't go to heaven
[43:58] before uh uh we our eternal life begins
[44:03] here that's what the new birth is that's
[44:06] what the Holy Ghost
[44:12] is the churches teaches that you have to
[44:15] die and then before you go and have that
[44:17] internal
[44:21] reward but for the believer it begins
[44:24] here
[44:30] and when we look more into this it
[44:31] becomes interesting because heaven is
[44:34] the opening of the
[44:36] word Heaven is identifying your
[44:40] purpose from the
[44:42] word under the four seeds he says Heaven
[44:45] consists of the

[45:45] should I leave this church and go to
[45:46] this church should I leave this one and
[45:48] go to that one no Jesus was talking

[52:26] Christ Christ
[52:27] name
[52:31] amen okay while we are standing maybe
[52:33] you have to you can take your Bible with
[52:35] me and uh you just read a
[52:43] test I'm taking my test from The Book of
[52:46] Luke Luke chapter
[52:54] 19 Luke
[52:57] 19
[53:06] 43
[53:07] and to
[53:09] 45 43 to 45 for the days shall come upon
[53:16] thee that thy enemies shall cast a
[53:21] trench about thee and Compass thee
[53:25] run and keep thee in on every
[53:30] side and shall lay thee even with the
[53:35] ground and th children with thee and
[53:38] they shall not live in thee one stone
[53:44] upon
[53:45] another
[53:46] because th knowe not the time of th
[53:52] visitation and uh he went into the
[53:55] temple and began to cast out them that
[53:57] sold therein and them that bought may
[54:01] the Lord are blessing to read of his
[54:03] word you can have BL it for
[54:09] now I want to speak on the subject the
[54:12] hour of
[54:15] visitation the hour of visitation the
[54:19] Lord bless each one of
[54:20] you and I thank my friend
[54:24] bran for any time I knock at his
[54:29] door regardless maybe situation may be
[54:32] difficult he always open the doors for
[54:36] me I thank him very much for doing
[54:39] that and that is the respect that we can
[54:43] show to one
[54:44] another when you can open your puppet
[54:47] for a minister the
[54:51] respect you have to have confidence in
[54:53] the one that you give you the p
[54:58] because Sons and Daughters of God are
[55:01] pies they pict with an expensive
[55:05] price so when we coming into your
[55:07] presence like this it's not a
[55:10] joke it is a serious
[55:14] business who boast that he's a preacher
[55:18] sometimes I see people oh I can preach
[55:20] brother when you see somebody boasting
[55:22] he can preach there's something wrong
[55:24] with him said bring him to The Altar and
[55:27] pray for
[55:29] him the Holy Ghost preached the
[55:33] word that is why it's important when we
[55:36] are coming here we pray that God set us
[55:40] aside and let the gift come and
[55:44] operate and when the gift is in
[55:47] operation then you'll be pulling from
[55:49] Jesus you not pull for
[55:52] aen so this evening I believe you have
[55:55] prayed for
[55:57] me at the grace of God I know God will
[56:00] set me
[56:01] aside and he will come and minister to
[56:04] his
[56:06] bride the hour of
[56:11] visitation it is important to know your
[56:16] visitation if you and someone book an
[56:21] appointment and then he promise and give
[56:23] you a time that you will be coming you
[56:26] at such and such time you'll be in
[56:30] expectation
[56:31] yes you'll be waiting for him at that
[56:35] time because he has promised to visit
[56:39] around that very moment so you are in
[56:47] expectation now this Bible that we
[56:50] cherish
[56:52] most we must be very very careful
[56:57] how we look into the word of God and
[57:00] what we see if our eyes are not
[57:03] anointed you see wrong
[57:05] things but if your eyes are
[57:09] anointed that's why said you must read
[57:12] the Bible with the eyes of God in
[57:15] Satan's
[57:16] hiding and if you are reading it with
[57:19] the eyes of God you'll see exactly what
[57:21] God was talking about
[57:26] that is why he said I will anoint your
[57:28] eyes he knows the problem God knows what
[57:31] we were going to go
[57:34] through and he found the situation in
[57:37] lusia he said you supposed to buy of me
[57:41] our to anoint your eyes to see what God
[57:45] want you to
[57:47] see the hour of
[57:51] visitation now Israel when God chose
[57:54] Abraham
[57:56] go was waking another Masterpiece
[57:59] because the first Master Masterpiece has
[58:01] been mad has been destroyed Satan got in
[58:04] and Destroy God's Masterpiece
[58:06] Adam so God has to work another
[58:09] Masterpiece so he got Abraham it is not
[58:14] Abraham because he was a good man no but
[58:18] God saw something in Abraham that he
[58:21] himself put it right
[58:23] there that when I call Abraham at the
[58:28] appointed time he will hear my
[58:33] voice so it was God that placed it right
[58:36] in him that is why you are you are
[58:39] sitting on that seat you are not here to
[58:41] occupy a seat you are here to take your
[58:43] place in Jesus Christ you are set in
[58:46] Heavenly places in Christ
[58:48] Jesus and brother said where is the
[58:51] believer's position your position is in
[58:54] Jesus Christ
[58:57] so
[58:59] friends when Abraham heard the voice of
[59:02] God he could not stri it is just a
[59:04] striking Affair he heard his
[59:07] voice because that voice was already
[59:10] placed in him B said the foundation
[59:13] stone has already been placed in the
[59:16] bride when God was laying this
[59:18] Foundation he plac a stone in you and
[59:21] that stone of Revelation is placing you
[59:24] that any word of God you will say Amen
[59:28] to
[59:29] that because there is something that is
[59:31] pulling the Rock in you rock upon rock
[59:35] rock upon Rock we are building a perfect
[59:38] structure that is why every age there is
[59:41] no way you can miss your
[59:44] message you can miss
[59:48] it the hour of
[59:50] visitation go to Abraham that Abraham

[1:00:37] will come out better
[1:00:41] amen the hour of
[1:00:46] visitation now
[1:00:49] listen
[1:00:51] Jeremiah he told
[1:00:54] Israel because God has appointed Prophet
[1:00:59] to them to warn them to speak to them so
[1:01:02] that they don't get anything missing or
[1:01:04] anything misplaced God appointed
[1:01:08] prophets to

[1:04:50] identity that's right
[1:04:53] [Music]
[1:04:58] yes the hour of
[1:05:02] visitation he said when Grace is refused
[1:05:07] judgment
[1:05:10] stri
[1:05:12] now
[1:05:15] does God doesn't call a man to judgment
[1:05:18] without first warning him 93 paragraph
[1:05:21] all right we found out the first he sent
[1:05:24] his prophet
[1:05:26] with warning he doesn't change his way
[1:05:30] his method of doing
[1:05:33] things he does not always strike when he
[1:05:38] wants he wants you to
[1:05:41] watch he want you to watch this
[1:05:44] quotation God gives a warning but he
[1:05:48] don't always strike the same time he
[1:05:53] wants but you you notice that and then
[1:05:57] when he doesn't strike when he send a
[1:06:01] warning then the prophet is
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:05] Mo you didn't have it you told a lie you
[1:06:11] wasn't right because he didn't strike at
[1:06:15] that same
[1:06:19] moment you know what what is going on we
[1:06:22] are waiting for the wrath of God but
[1:06:24] people are mocking oh a liive nothing
[1:06:26] will happen the world has be 2,000 oh no
[1:06:29] nothing will happen you people you don't

[1:06:35] die and go your way you are talking of
[1:06:37] Heaven they don't know what they talking
[1:06:38] about because God never
[1:06:42] strive by you
[1:06:46] stri
[1:06:49] amen Ahab refus warning nebuchad refus
[1:06:53] warning noest people refuse
[1:06:56] warning and they
[1:06:58] mock they thought it was a
[1:07:02] lie but when that visitation counts on
[1:07:06] them because they refuse salvation visit
[1:07:10] when you refuse salvation visitation you
[1:07:12] will really
[1:07:14] endure visitation of
[1:07:16] rra that why you cannot
[1:07:20] Escape can escape that one you can
[1:07:23] refuse Grace but but you cannot refuse
[1:07:32] judgment so now listen that is why you
[1:07:35] have to come to church brother the
[1:07:39] reason you come to church is to be
[1:07:41] yourself yes by the preaching of the
[1:07:45] word you sit in your home you listen to
[1:07:47] the table you read the message you read
[1:07:49] the Bible you have to get a pastor
[1:07:52] anointed man to put you in your place
[1:07:55] your position
[1:07:56] and to shape you with the
[1:07:58] sword when there is anything wrong he
[1:08:01] has to take the sword of God said you a
[1:08:04] stone indeed but a stone that is not
[1:08:07] caught and put into its appropriate
[1:08:09] place you'll be a rolling
[1:08:12] stone and the Rolling Stone doesn't make
[1:08:15] the building we put you there you roll
[1:08:17] and you fall we have to cut
[1:08:22] you and cutting is not pleasant
[1:08:26] that's why many people run away from
[1:08:27] church yes when you come to church the
[1:08:29] pastor will take the sword and cut
[1:08:32] you you think he's wounding you yes
[1:08:35] cutting is not pleas but he's putting
[1:08:37] you your R if he doesn't cut you fall
[1:08:39] down you'll fall back amen he has to cut
[1:08:42] you and shape you and put you in your
[1:08:44] place amen
[1:08:47] amen that is his business to cut you as
[1:08:49] a son and daughter of
[1:08:54] God the hour of
[1:08:57] visitation now look at in the days of
[1:09:02] Daniel Daniel
[1:09:05] 8:3 then I heard one Saint speaking and
[1:09:09] another Saint said unto the other
[1:09:11] certain Saint which spake you see it was
[1:09:15] not Angels
[1:09:17] Saints watch what Daniel is seeing here
[1:09:20] it is Saint Not
[1:09:22] Angels when we talk Saint we are the
[1:09:24] Saints
[1:09:28] but one Saint was speaking to another
[1:09:31] Saint how long shall be the vision
[1:09:34] concerning the daily
[1:09:35] sacrifice and the transgression of the
[1:09:38] solution to give both the sanctuary and
[1:09:41] the most holy to be troen and the food
[1:09:45] and he said unto me unto
[1:09:48] 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be
[1:09:52] C now
[1:09:55] Israel they're supposed to know that
[1:09:58] iniquity of Jacob must be wiped
[1:10:02] away if anything God could do with them
[1:10:06] iniquity must be washed away first
[1:10:09] because God has to abolish sin he has to
[1:10:14] give us a Son of God the Lamb of God not
[1:10:18] a lamb that cover cover sin but the lamb
[1:10:21] that take away sin
[1:10:26] that is why we are we are in a very good
[1:10:29] security we are in a very good Zone we
[1:10:32] are
[1:10:33] secure because our sins have been
[1:10:36] blotted
[1:10:38] out the sin you do tomorrow has been
[1:10:41] blotted out tomorrow the that you do let
[1:10:43] me tell you if you're a child of
[1:10:48] God you must have that
[1:10:51] confidence otherwise the enemy will come
[1:10:53] and trick you around
[1:10:56] because a Son of God if he go or if he
[1:11:00] fall into any error there is no way his
[1:11:03] heart will not condemn him or her if you
[1:11:05] indeed a child of God you are heart to
[1:11:07] condemn
[1:11:09] you there the reason he put the Holy
[1:11:12] Ghost in you if your heart doesn't
[1:11:14] condemn you then you must praise the
[1:11:17] Lord my heart is strong it's a wrong
[1:11:23] heart you need condemnation
[1:11:28] the Bible say if you judge yourself God
[1:11:30] will not judge
[1:11:31] you we need a holy ghost to judge
[1:11:34] us that's why the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:41] given the hour of
[1:11:45] visitation
[1:11:47] now when s ask another sin where where
[1:11:51] is it going to be when the daily
[1:11:53] sacrifice will be taken what is the
[1:11:55] daily sacrifice the people were very
[1:11:59] they were very much interested in
[1:12:01] killing animals and eating meat and all
[1:12:04] this kind of stuff they were interested
[1:12:06] in those things and you me that the
[1:12:09] priest will not go and then kill the
[1:12:11] Sheep again you said this that we are
[1:12:13] making business you mean it is going to
[1:12:17] cease
[1:12:18] amen they didn't want that sacrifice to
[1:12:21] ceas because they making business out of
[1:12:23] life how they sell sheep how they sayell
[1:12:24] go how they were making big business and
[1:12:28] you mean the daily sacrifice we
[1:12:30] seiz
[1:12:33] amen that's his
[1:12:35] business now I
[1:12:40] said in this
[1:12:42] message let me read what the prophet
[1:12:45] said
[1:12:47] here but there was a time this is
[1:12:50] revelation 5 part 1 there was a time of
[1:12:53] the cleansing of the sanctuary
[1:12:56] when it was a judgment seat as long as
[1:12:59] the blood was off of the
[1:13:03] seed as long as the blood of Jesus is
[1:13:06] still on the seed is a mercy
[1:13:10] seed that is why you are a Mery seed
[1:13:13] today because the blood is on
[1:13:18] you you are the AR God is living in
[1:13:23] you that is the the reason you show
[1:13:26] Mercy you don't call for God's
[1:13:31] Wrath you a mercy
[1:13:35] seat because the blood is still on
[1:13:39] you but when the blood is taken away
[1:13:41] when the bread is ruptured there will be
[1:13:44] no blood it will be cler the Bible say
[1:13:48] cler CLE nothing no
[1:13:51] blood will be found on the altar
[1:13:55] there will be no atonement again it's
[1:14:00] finished now said now we approaching
[1:14:03] that time now we are approaching in this
[1:14:06] age a cleansing of the sanctuary and the
[1:14:09] Judgment coming upon the Earth you see
[1:14:12] as long as blood is there God cannot
[1:14:15] destroy the Earth as long as blood is
[1:14:17] there
[1:14:19] nobody nobody is a sinner before God
[1:14:25] as long as the blood is there God so
[1:14:29] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:14:32] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:14:34] him will not perish that
[1:14:38] right and what did John say this is the
[1:14:42] lamp of God that take away the sins of
[1:14:46] the he did not say the sins of the Bride
[1:14:49] the sins of the world Hallelujah
[1:14:55] that is why BR said the reason people be
[1:14:59] judged is because they refuse their
[1:15:04] representative you are not going to be
[1:15:06] judged because you are a sinner you are
[1:15:08] going to be judged because you refuse
[1:15:10] your
[1:15:13] representative Jesus stood for
[1:15:18] you he died for
[1:15:21] everybody he was no selective
[1:15:25] that is why nobody can really stand in
[1:15:27] the presence of God at the judg may see
[1:15:29] it and then you you you appreciate you
[1:15:32] thank God you are a righteous
[1:15:34] judge everybody will thank God he will
[1:15:37] say go to hell you you praise him God
[1:15:39] you you are a righteous
[1:15:44] judge there's no one that is going to
[1:15:46] Bluff or going to accuse God on that day
[1:15:49] everyone will
[1:15:52] appreciate he has given everybody opport
[1:15:55] to
[1:15:58] repent the warning is coming for that is
[1:16:01] the visitation your visitation is today
[1:16:04] God is visiting you maybe you are
[1:16:07] battling with some challenges this is
[1:16:09] your day you have to overcome that
[1:16:11] challenge because God will give you the
[1:16:13] ability the power to overcome that is
[1:16:16] why you come to church to be encouraged
[1:16:18] to get Faith
[1:16:27] the hour of
[1:16:31] visitation the lamb the Messiah the
[1:16:33] prince should come and should be for 70
[1:16:37] weeks and 70 that that 70 years that was
[1:16:41] prophesied to his people and the prince
[1:16:44] will be cut off in the midst that's
[1:16:47] three three and a half years of the
[1:16:49] seven years and then and the daily
[1:16:53] sacrifice will be done at away with and
[1:16:55] the Abomination that make it desolate
[1:16:58] that is the Muslim M of Omar stood on
[1:17:01] the temple
[1:17:04] grounds that day when they bur the
[1:17:06] temple and then there is three and half
[1:17:09] years yet left to Israel
[1:17:15] amen they refused their
[1:17:17] visitation when Jesus was right with
[1:17:20] them they they could not
[1:17:23] see the ense the purpose of God coming
[1:17:27] to them in
[1:17:31] flesh the Father Abraham saw his
[1:17:35] visitation when God became free he took
[1:17:38] D the 16 elements God come down he took
[1:17:42] the C element made a temple made a
[1:17:45] temple made a temple three of them jump
[1:17:47] in these temples they walk to
[1:17:50] Abraham God in human flesh
[1:17:55] that was the visitation that was the
[1:17:57] last son Abraham supposed to see before
[1:18:04] Isaac God walking to his prophet in
[1:18:08] human
[1:18:10] flesh you
[1:18:12] understand in Abraham there is no
[1:18:16] nothing between him and God that will be
[1:18:18] let left loose he is always connected
[1:18:21] with God consciously always looking for
[1:18:24] the presence of God my my friend if only
[1:18:27] you are very conscious about God you are
[1:18:29] conscious about the Holy Ghost very
[1:18:35] sensitive he will speak he is always on
[1:18:38] speaking
[1:18:41] terms he's not far away look at Israel
[1:18:46] when they were testing and they were
[1:18:48] crying The Rock was still with them The
[1:18:51] Rock was in speaking terms with them but
[1:18:54] they have really left the
[1:19:01] rock oh god of
[1:19:07] Mercy the hour of
[1:19:11] visitation now
[1:19:18] listen there is coming a
[1:19:20] day that
[1:19:22] because Israel they could not see their
[1:19:27] visitation Jesus told
[1:19:30] them because you refuse to know your
[1:19:33] visitation this building of Solomon you
[1:19:36] are showing to me a stone will not rest
[1:19:38] upon a
[1:19:39] stone it will all be brought
[1:19:43] down and we are going to suffer this and
[1:19:46] they said let the blood come upon
[1:19:50] Earth you see what the suffering Israel
[1:19:53] is suffering today
[1:19:55] they call for
[1:19:59] it but the only favor we can do to
[1:20:02] Israel is to get oursel ready and move
[1:20:04] out from this Earth if you don't go
[1:20:07] Israel will still
[1:20:09] suffer we have to go and let Jesus visit
[1:20:13] them and show them his palms and let
[1:20:15] them recognize the Messiah they rejected
[1:20:25] but you and I we don't want to
[1:20:27] go we not ready to live this earth like
[1:20:32] Moses was not ready to leave fellow
[1:20:33] parat he was
[1:20:36] comfortable but God has to put pressure
[1:20:38] on
[1:20:42] him in this conv zones I'm telling you
[1:20:45] God will put pleasure on us and then you
[1:20:48] know that what is in you will be
[1:20:50] groaning he said we the the fful we are

[1:21:07] to
[1:21:13] weep so
[1:21:16] Moses he has to kill an
[1:21:19] Egyptian and when he killed an
[1:21:21] Egyptian God was sitting in the
[1:21:23] wilderness laughing this man of God is
[1:21:25] say yeah Pharaoh is chasing this guy now

[1:21:41] you the hour was come for God to visit
[1:21:45] Israel because they rejected Moses they
[1:21:48] had to count another 30 years that is
[1:21:51] what we are dealing with friends we are
[1:21:53] here suffering on this a because we have
[1:21:56] refused our
[1:22:01] visitation it is time for us to be a get
[1:22:05] this awareness this Consciousness

[1:22:12] age our Prophet Willam abam he is not

[1:22:35] Temple the things that did on Earth he
[1:22:39] said even God was had success in brother
[1:22:43] Ministry than when Jesus was here he
[1:22:45] said
[1:22:48] it he said now let me tell you you are

[1:24:01] heart and Jesus
[1:24:04] come he does the same
[1:24:07] sign for them to recognize him they

[1:43:20] you also have message for the dead this
[1:43:22] day generation Minnesota you this your
[1:43:25] community people are dying in sin you
[1:43:28] have a message let us carry a message to
[1:43:30] the
[1:43:32] dead and it's an urgent
[1:43:36] Commission carry it in your compound
[1:43:38] tell somebody about Jesus
[1:43:44] Christ carry the message to the dead and
[1:43:47] don't stop and talk about politics don't
[1:43:50] stop and talk about business
[1:43:53] go
[1:43:54] straight when Andrew saw Jesus when
[1:43:59] Phillip saw Jesus he did not tell Nat
[1:44:02] Nat how are the crops the crops doing
[1:44:05] how is the farm how is the how is
[1:44:08] everything how is no no no no no he went
[1:44:11] straight I have found
[1:44:14] him I have found
[1:44:20] him the hour of visitation
[1:44:25] said God is using three bodies the first
[1:44:27] body God used he created
[1:44:30] it got into the body walked to Abraham
[1:44:34] the second body was the spoken word body
[1:44:37] he spoke it Mary thou shall conceive and
[1:44:42] bear a
[1:44:44] son spoking word
[1:44:49] creative the people could not
[1:44:53] understand
[1:44:55] how this will happen but the scripture
[1:44:58] has SP it Bly a virin shall
[1:45:03] conceive
[1:45:05] scripture why did they miss
[1:45:10] it said sometime when God is doing any
[1:45:13] anything he do it in a way for cries to
[1:45:17] to get their
[1:45:20] place so if you are here in this church
[1:45:22] to God will give room for you to get lot
[1:45:26] of things to criticize here because that
[1:45:29] is why we
[1:45:34] here if God have chosen a virgin that
[1:45:38] was not a spous they will have
[1:45:42] believed see how God Did It
[1:45:46] Before Adam could go to Eve Satan went
[1:45:49] ahead before Joseph could go to Mary God
[1:45:51] went ahead
[1:45:53] he did it the same
[1:45:55] way the same
[1:45:58] way that is why they could not believe
[1:46:00] it because they thought Joseph was
[1:46:03] telling a lie and when Joseph even
[1:46:05] thought Mary has played that is the
[1:46:08] cheat on
[1:46:11] him the angel said Joseph that son of
[1:46:15] David don't do
[1:46:16] that look at the
[1:46:20] scripture my wife is carrying the Holy
[1:46:28] Ghost you understand and Joseph that was
[1:46:32] the silence
[1:46:34] him but to the
[1:46:37] CRI when Jesus was preaching to them
[1:46:39] they said we are not born of fornication
[1:46:41] like you we we are not born of for like
[1:46:45] you you beel you are a Samaritan you
[1:46:49] have a
[1:46:50] devil dear Messiah
[1:46:54] is the same thing people are doing to
[1:46:57] today this is the thir Temple God has
[1:47:00] used God use that is Creative Body
[1:47:04] spoken word body and redeemed
[1:47:10] body a sinner will BR body a sinner my
[1:47:15] body God redeemed the
[1:47:17] body to use
[1:47:21] it that's always tell us friends I'm
[1:47:24] also a sinner like you saved by
[1:47:30] grace but he has a special business he
[1:47:34] has a special office that none of us can
[1:47:36] fit into that office don't try to
[1:47:38] imitate
[1:47:43] him God call him for special Duty for
[1:47:46] this
[1:47:48] age for we Abraham Royal seed to see see
[1:47:53] God in flesh the son of
[1:47:57] man that is why God is revealing to you
[1:48:01] your eyes are anointed to see the
[1:48:04] message of your day when Jesus was on
[1:48:06] Earth he told the disciples don't go to
[1:48:09] the way of the
[1:48:11] Gentiles it is not their day to see
[1:48:14] Messiah so they did not come the way of
[1:48:17] the
[1:48:18] Gentiles Matthew chapter 10 read that he
[1:48:21] stopped them
[1:48:25] but when it go to the time for our
[1:48:27] visitation God has to get a
[1:48:31] man to reveal to us the mysteries of
[1:48:39] godliness you
[1:48:42] understand that is why Paul could not
[1:48:45] know Jesus Christ when Jesus was in
[1:48:49] flesh because Paul was a messenger to
[1:48:52] the Gentiles and we were not supposed to
[1:48:54] see Jesus in flesh we are supposed to
[1:48:57] see Jesus in the
[1:49:00] spirit that's why Paul also have to see
[1:49:03] Jesus in the
[1:49:05] spirit he was our
[1:49:08] messenger he hit him on the way of
[1:49:10] Damascus that was his visitation I want
[1:49:13] everyone of us to have that experience
[1:49:16] brother if God have never hit you down
[1:49:18] you not understand what we are talking
[1:49:20] about
[1:49:24] you need a strike God has to strike you
[1:49:28] and then when you fall down then you ask
[1:49:29] him who are th he say I am
[1:49:33] Jesus when he reveal himself to you in
[1:49:35] that manner something will hold
[1:49:40] you we'll be closing very soon friends
[1:49:45] can you see your
[1:49:48] visitation can you see that God has
[1:49:50] visited it in this age
[1:49:53] he has come Among
[1:49:54] Us in the body of brother
[1:50:01] Bram but let nobody make any God of No
[1:50:07] let us not do that people I went to
[1:50:09] India people were trying to do that in
[1:50:12] India and even many places they doing it
[1:50:15] but you don't do
[1:50:18] that he's he's our brother
[1:50:22] God wanted us to see
[1:50:25] Messiah we the Gentiles that is why he
[1:50:30] has to bring him to reveal the Mysteries
[1:50:34] to us he said you the Gentiles this is
[1:50:38] your day for you to see Christ in
[1:50:44] flesh so we are not going to abuse this
[1:50:48] privilege like the people that don't
[1:50:52] have Revelation that is why God has
[1:50:54] given us Revelation to understand these
[1:50:58] things the hour of visitation God told
[1:51:03] that is Israel when they were in Egypt
[1:51:06] he said God will surely visit
[1:51:10] you Joseph told them God will surely
[1:51:13] visit you so when you will be going go
[1:51:16] with my bones don't leave my bones here
[1:51:19] he knew that God will visit Israel
[1:51:24] and when the visitation came they packed
[1:51:26] the bones of
[1:51:29] Joseph abam said the an he said that is
[1:51:33] what is happening today now the body of
[1:51:37] Jesus Christ is lying
[1:51:39] there as long as the Angels always see
[1:51:42] the body as long as God always look at
[1:51:45] the body he knows there will be a day of
[1:51:51] visitation one of the is this he will
[1:51:53] jump into that glorified body again and
