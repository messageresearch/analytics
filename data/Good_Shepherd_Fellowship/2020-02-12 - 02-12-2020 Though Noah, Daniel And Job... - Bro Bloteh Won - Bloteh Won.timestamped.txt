[42:28] their education just behind Joshua
[42:31] testimony was just specially me and we
[42:35] are grateful for their praise the Lord
[42:36] and a few like we announced on Sunday
[42:48] this coming Sunday we'll have a
[42:49] communion service we want to remind you
[42:52] 5 p.m. we'll be back in the evening to
[42:56] have communion with the Lord we skip the
[43:03] communion service the first Sunday of
[43:05] this month and then since I will be away
[43:08] the first Sunday of next month so I
[43:11] think it would be a good thing for us to
[43:13] come in fellowship in have a prayer
[43:16] meeting Sunday evening and you pray for
[43:20] me anywhere I pray for you and we can
[43:24] stand on the promises of God amen praise
[43:28] the Lord also Sunday we will you also
[43:34] may make some announcement for the month
[43:42] of March I was I was thinking about
[43:48] [Music]
[43:52] I was actually talking to one of the
[43:54] same thing we were and there was a
[43:57] question that was asked me how do you
[44:00] know a religious spirit and so after we
[44:06] talk a little bit and talk to the person
[44:10] and and just gather them in the word
[44:13] I actually ask them to go and listen to
[44:15] a message after we finish talking I said
[44:17] listen to this message and then you you
[44:20] might be able to learn a little bit from
[44:22] it but then I was thinking about there
[44:24] too when I got out of their composition
[44:26] I said well maybe there will be a good
[44:29] thing maybe they come in not of match we
[44:33] will have a time I think I spoke about
[44:39] then we supposed to be almost done with
[44:42] the subject that he's doing for Sunday
[44:44] school and then we would take the
[44:47] message impersonation of Christianity
[44:49] there's 57 or 120 we will play that but
[44:57] then we will announce and also encourage
[45:00] you to be able to listen to the message
[45:03] at home study it yourself because as we
[45:07] play a true through the other Sunday
[45:12] School there are there there are things
[45:16] that we would like to talk about whether
[45:19] when we come to the end of the message
[45:21] we will we would like to just open a
[45:25] time of discussion and see some of the
[45:27] things that we pick up during that time
[45:30] now you know I want to speak on
[45:35] something tonight just before we go home
[45:38] but you know I've never tried to be I
[45:43] try to keep politics away from the
[45:45] pulpit because it's no place for
[45:47] politics you know but they are things
[45:51] that that are happening around us I
[45:57] don't know what this year holds for us
[46:01] but we know him the whole time in
[46:03] eternity
[46:04] Heys but we see things things are moving
[46:08] in in a direction word we I mean we
[46:12] learn to trust the law and just look to
[46:15] see how everything is happening around
[46:18] us but now I was standing I want to
[46:21] encourage you this is just the second
[46:24] month of the year and Bert Branham says
[46:27] in the same night that Jesus was
[46:29] betrayal from that time that Judas
[46:34] Iscariot the communion service and went
[46:37] over to the todo to the Pharisees right
[46:41] between that time he says there were
[46:43] thousands of prophecy that was fulfilled
[46:46] from that time to the very time what
[46:49] Jesus said father into your hands I
[46:52] commit my spirit a short period of time
[46:55] there were thousands of Bible prophecies
[46:59] that will fulfill so God don't need a
[47:03] whole year to to fulfill all of his word
[47:07] he don't need a whole year praise the
[47:11] Lord I believe that we we are standing
[47:17] on one of the greatest time in history
[47:19] and because our future is the rapture so
[47:25] it's one of the greatest time in history
[47:27] that we are standing but year instead is
[47:30] a scary time to the word amen to the
[47:33] people that don't have no hope and no
[47:35] foundation in Christ is a scary time to
[47:38] them praise the Lord
[47:40] just a couple of years back the nation
[47:45] kind of legalized same-sex marriage and
[47:50] it was looking like a big thing but now
[47:54] we have in same-sex marriage going into
[47:56] the White House in a White House race
[47:59] then it should be more scary to the
[48:02] nation these things happen you know and
[48:08] we wink our shoulder I didn't and you
[48:12] know and and one of the one of the thing
[48:15] about the last year's spirit is is to
[48:18] just make you complicit it is to just is
[48:23] to just have you to agree with the Papa
[48:26] love you everybody is agreeing with it
[48:30] let's let's agree with it let's see what
[48:32] will happen
[48:34] praise the Lord but I think better it's
[48:45] not a time for father for the church to
[48:49] be lazy it's not a time for the church
[48:53] to be slumbering praise the Lord it's
[48:57] time for us to be on our toes it's time
[49:01] for us to be seeking the face of God
[49:03] it's time for us to be praying it's time
[49:05] for us to be cleaning our lives and
[49:07] cleaning our home and cleaning the
[49:10] church and bringing the power of God
[49:12] creating an atmosphere for the part of
[49:14] God to come back in the church because
[49:17] we we need their power to get out of
[49:19] here
[49:20] praise the Lord amen in as much as last
[49:32] year was a was a year of you know we we
[49:36] were trusting the Lord in and I mean
[49:40] believing God for different things and
[49:43] it's like we came to the end of the year
[49:45] and we fear they're accountable relief
[49:49] of victory I think like brother Branham
[49:53] says the more lawyer you become the more
[49:55] trial you have so with that being said
[50:01] tonight I just want to take a little
[50:04] touch here from the Book of Ezekiel
[50:07] chapter 14 if we were just into our feet
[50:10] and
[50:27] Ezekiel chapter 14
[50:47] let's read from verse 12 and the word of
[50:50] the law came again unto me saying son of
[50:54] man when the land seen it against me but
[50:59] trespassing grievously then I would
[51:03] stretch out my hand upon it and we break
[51:07] this type of the bread there off and we
[51:11] same farming upon it and we cut off man
[51:16] and beast from it though these three men
[51:22] Noah Daniel and job were in it
[51:26] - you deliver both their own Souls by
[51:32] their righteousness said the Lord God if
[51:38] I caused not zombies
[51:41] to pass through the land and they spoil
[51:45] it so that it be desolate that no man
[51:53] may pass through because of the beasts
[51:56] though these three men were in it as I
[52:01] live saith the Lord God they shall
[52:04] deliver neither son nor daughter they
[52:09] shall they only shall be delivered but
[52:16] the lane shall be desolate or if I bring
[52:21] a sward upon the lane and say it's war
[52:24] go through the lane so that I cut off
[52:28] men and beasts from it though these
[52:31] three men over and over the scripture
[52:33] talks about these three men let's pray
[52:35] together Heavenly Father in the name of
[52:38] the Lord Jesus Christ we just ask Oh God
[52:41] - nightfire the Lord as we come of
[52:44] garden and try to Lord approach you by
[52:47] the way of praying and in trying to
[52:51] concentrate on your Lord trying father
[52:54] to get our mind from the destruction of
[52:57] father of our self in the things that is
[53:00] around us
[53:01] Lord we come humbly tonight father and
[53:04] asking your help that you would come of
[53:06] God and just bless the portion of your
[53:08] word that we have read all God and speak
[53:11] to us to night Lord
[53:12] we're just committing ourselves into
[53:14] your hand so father Lord we need you

[53:34] upon us O God we will pray to naru
[53:37] father and say fill us with the Holy
[53:39] Ghost

[53:58] though these three men estranged died
[54:10] right here the Bible brings these three
[54:12] characters together I pray that the law
[54:15] will be able to help helping to be able
[54:17] to do we ought to draw something from
[54:22] here tonight I will be able to help us
[54:24] now the Bible year that Ezekiel the
[54:26] Prophet is talking about a time of
[54:30] judgment as we spoke about that one time
[54:34] we were talking about the importance of
[54:38] the Elijah ministry we pick up these
[54:40] three things over and over you see in
[54:42] the scripture whenever God will bring
[54:46] judgment to the land he always come in
[54:49] one of these three or four why because
[54:53] four is the number of deliverance praise
[54:56] the Lord
[54:56] so yeah God spare are four things is
[55:00] pestilence not some beasts and in a
[55:05] small and funny praise the Lord
[55:11] amen
[55:13] so these four things he point out here
[55:16] in the scripture but all through the
[55:20] Bible and commentators and great men
[55:25] that stated the scripture they took
[55:27] these three men Noah Daniel and job to
[55:31] be the most three righteous men counted
[55:33] out in the stricture for the fact that
[55:35] God is even measuring them over to the
[55:40] prophet Ezekiel then job lived a very
[55:44] long time and I call into history he
[55:48] came right after the time of Noah
[55:50] because job referred to the floor in his
[55:53] writing so he was right between the time
[55:56] of Noah and Abraham he might have left
[55:58] praise the Lord Amen now brother Branham
[56:02] said job is the oldest book in the Bible
[56:04] it does not means that he lived before
[56:07] Adam it means that that was the first
[56:10] recorded book because Moses was the one
[56:13] that wrote the book of Genesis but what
[56:15] job has already given job has already
[56:18] had a record of his trial amen because
[56:23] he said it there in the book of Job
[56:25] praise the Lord
[56:27] so so we see here that God is measuring
[56:36] this and that's one of the reason why we
[56:38] can believe that the book of Job is not
[56:41] just a story that was formulated about
[56:43] somebody it was a real thing
[56:45] amen because God would not bring it back
[56:48] if it was just a story that Moses wrote
[56:50] or a story that somebody wrote just to
[56:53] make us to feel sorry for the man called
[56:55] job it was something that actually
[56:57] happened to a human just like you and
[57:00] myself praise the Lord
[57:03] amen are we together but God is bringing
[57:07] this that time you have to realize now
[57:10] that this is the time of of the anxiety
[57:14] of Israel over there in Babylon and I
[57:18] mean he's talking about after the people
[57:21] have seen it against God the people has
[57:24] gone away from God I mean
[57:26] when people have indulged themselves in
[57:29] things that is against the Word of God
[57:32] just just going against mercy amen
[57:37] praise the Lord and God over and over to
[57:40] show him mercy but the people still
[57:42] riding over God's mercy then he comes
[57:46] down to this place and says if he bring
[57:49] a judgment he says a visitation upon the
[57:53] land whether is a farming or whether is
[57:56] a sward and pestilent we seeing all of
[57:58] these things happening and we see that
[58:01] great virus over there in China just
[58:04] like the Ebola was in Africa and all of
[58:07] these things there is all signs of
[58:09] judgment praise the Lord Amen when those
[58:15] things comes in and take and hundreds of
[58:18] life away is it's not an accident it's a
[58:22] sign of judgment prays alone and it's
[58:28] now owned it against China it's against
[58:30] the whole world because those virus they
[58:33] don't need possible to travel anywhere
[58:36] it's right in the air
[58:51] praise the Lord I think we need to be
[58:58] breathing in God's Word and reading
[59:01] God's promises taking this Bible and
[59:04] sticking it to our nose and in God's
[59:06] promises then you know then then Wareham
[59:10] axis will help us also praise the Lord
[59:15] but you ever said that God is saying I
[59:18] mean he's talking to the prophet Ezekiel
[59:21] yet and the word of the Lord came and
[59:23] says son of man which mean the Prophet
[59:26] and when they went that when when the
[59:29] land seen against me but trespassing
[59:33] grievously you remember the days the
[59:37] days of Noah what did the scripture says
[59:39] when the Spirit of God would no longer
[59:42] strive with me a man can do something
[59:47] and God will keep beating iya conscious
[59:51] but there will be a time we're going not
[59:54] strive with you and it's a dangerous
[59:56] place to be
[59:58] amen that the God of heaven will decide
[1:00:02] not to even warn you not to even touch
[1:00:06] your conscious now to even touch your
[1:00:08] heart nothing nothing I mean nothing
[1:00:11] would seem wrong
[1:00:20] and how many times he he pricks our
[1:00:22] conscious and he speak to us but yet
[1:00:24] instead we stayed guest stubborn and we
[1:00:26] stick in our ways
[1:00:28] how much more if he choose to not strive
[1:00:31] with you if the land seen grievously
[1:00:38] trespass grievously I mean same gets to
[1:00:42] the place where God says I fool my hands
[1:00:47] let me see if you can bring yourself out
[1:00:52] amen
[1:00:54] he says if if the if the land ever gets
[1:00:59] to that place see what he's saying if
[1:01:04] the lame ever gets to that place and he
[1:01:12] said even if these three men with all
[1:01:18] the erogenous the Bible says Noah was a
[1:01:22] righteous man amen job got stuck in the
[1:01:29] integrity of his righteousness he would
[1:01:32] not take the accusation of his of his
[1:01:35] friends praise the Lord
[1:01:38] now even though these three men Noah job
[1:01:44] and Daniel was found in their lane God
[1:01:48] is saying their prayers cannot hold back
[1:01:52] God's judgement now the reason why I
[1:01:55] bring in the scripture is because we are
[1:01:57] right at that place we are right at our
[1:02:02] pleasure year people Oh let's pray for
[1:02:05] the nation you know how I was some work
[1:02:07] and and and it was not tool I was trying
[1:02:10] to do something and it was not too long
[1:02:12] this person knew that I was a preacher
[1:02:15] begotten they were looking at some
[1:02:16] information and and and then we started
[1:02:21] talking from wanting to another you know
[1:02:24] in his having all of this great mind you
[1:02:26] know in her and you
[1:02:28] and this nation will rise again in
[1:02:30] Africa will rise again I mean and they
[1:02:32] were talking all of these things and you
[1:02:37] know we started talking things and
[1:02:39] things he was saying that your stolen
[1:02:41] assets were you know when when people
[1:02:42] drift away from God that's the reason
[1:02:45] why we can we can see the kind of things
[1:02:47] that we are having you know seed up one
[1:02:50] of the greatest nation in a word being
[1:02:52] blessed just like Israel you know and
[1:02:55] see the things that is happening around
[1:02:56] the world you know but there is there is
[1:02:59] a this hope amen
[1:03:02] you know there is this hope Eman and
[1:03:05] it's not bad that we have this hope but
[1:03:09] we must be hoping for a resurrection we
[1:03:12] must be hoping for a rapture not a death
[1:03:16] Society to rise again because there is
[1:03:18] nothing can come from out of this
[1:03:20] society what is America this Europe or
[1:03:26] Africa is there's nothing good can come
[1:03:29] from out of it the only thing good will
[1:03:34] be the crops of God the Redeem of the
[1:03:41] Lord praise the Lord
[1:03:48] so God is talking to is right here in
[1:03:52] the case of of Jerusalem what Jeremiah
[1:03:56] have prophesied on their laning and
[1:03:59] against the evil that the people have
[1:04:01] done that even though these three men
[1:04:05] were in it their prayer will not save
[1:04:09] the city
[1:04:15] the appraiser will not save the city
[1:04:21] praise the Lord
[1:04:28] now back in Genesis when it when Abraham
[1:04:32] was interested in now you have to
[1:04:34] remember Genesis chapter 15 the city of
[1:04:38] Sodom was conquered and Abraham went out
[1:04:42] with his man and he redeemed his kursi
[1:04:45] lot and the king of Sodom and and but
[1:04:48] this time and when those angels went
[1:04:52] down there to sue them
[1:04:54] Abraham was on the other side Intercity
[1:04:57] he was now only interceding for for Lord
[1:05:01] he was interceding for the city of Sodom
[1:05:07] praise the Lord
[1:05:12] Genesis chapter 15 god back Abraham a
[1:05:18] man that never had no military he just
[1:05:21] wanted rally the men Eliezer and the
[1:05:23] rest of those boys that was in his house
[1:05:25] God was able to go before them amen was
[1:05:34] able to go before them in in battle and
[1:05:37] and and give him the victory fighting
[1:05:41] with bronze takes aim and and and hawks
[1:05:44] and and and whatever they could have in
[1:05:47] your hand but yet God was able to back
[1:05:49] him up but this time God would not even
[1:05:52] hear his seven
[1:06:03] price of Oy
[1:06:14] it's very interesting because when you
[1:06:16] look at these three men Daniel was in a
[1:06:20] time when the swore was visiting the
[1:06:23] land because it took the captivity of
[1:06:26] Jerusalem to put Daniel into Babylon Jim
[1:06:30] was in a time where pestilence was
[1:06:32] visiting his body and Noah was in a time
[1:06:38] that I would call the time of Fahmy
[1:06:44] praise the Lord amen
[1:06:57] so we see these things and it's strange
[1:07:04] that you look at you look at out of
[1:07:07] those men in the time that I live and
[1:07:10] the things that were going on you
[1:07:16] realize that the Bible says Noah what
[1:07:24] Joseph Armour amen
[1:07:30] he was just a farmer a humble simple
[1:07:36] farmer and he got a call from the Lord
[1:07:41] and girls start dealing with his head he
[1:07:44] was not even into construction but yet
[1:07:47] God asked him to build a knack all he
[1:07:52] knew was just to tell the earth praise
[1:07:57] the Lord and you realize it's so it's so
[1:08:04] strange that God is saying this to
[1:08:06] Ezekiel the Prophet I read something to
[1:08:08] you from your enemy in a little bit here
[1:08:10] that God is saying this to Ezekiel the
[1:08:13] Prophet it's so strange because you
[1:08:16] realize that each of those men in their
[1:08:20] age and time just like her job hard to
[1:08:23] stand alone Noah also had to stand alone
[1:08:30] Daniel also had to stand alone praise
[1:08:37] the Lord
[1:08:42] you can go on any one righteousness they
[1:08:50] all had to stand alone in India day of
[1:08:54] trial prays alone you just think about
[1:09:01] it the whole world at that time the
[1:09:06] whole world had Noah's time
[1:09:10] the whole world the whole existing word
[1:09:15] at that time he was the only man that
[1:09:18] had the message
[1:09:19] bill a knock there was nobody as
[1:09:25] preaching that same message
[1:09:26] anywhere around the world it was the
[1:09:31] whole entire world against one man Laura
[1:09:36] and he had to stand with his conviction
[1:09:40] that he believed that he had where from
[1:09:42] God he believed that there was going to
[1:09:45] be rain when it had not even rained he
[1:09:49] had to stand alone against the whole
[1:09:55] entire world
[1:10:00] praise the Lord
[1:10:07] I mean Dania had to stand alone publicly
[1:10:14] when the King announced that there will
[1:10:17] be no man to pray I believe there were
[1:10:19] other Jews that were praying but they
[1:10:21] were all praying in hiding but Dania had
[1:10:24] to be the only man alone that will open
[1:10:26] his curtains because there was nobody
[1:10:32] that went to the lion den with Dania he
[1:10:34] went there alone he had to stand alone
[1:10:42] just like job it was injured generation
[1:10:46] there was no male like this man job it
[1:10:48] had never happened before four in one
[1:10:50] day time for the man to lose all his all
[1:10:54] all that he ever had never happy in the
[1:10:56] world but he had to stand alone it's
[1:11:08] wrong well we have to be we have to be
[1:11:10] begging people we have to text them we
[1:11:12] have to call them we have to I mean we
[1:11:15] have to do everything and God has given
[1:11:17] us I mean everything but yet a state is
[1:11:21] so hard to stand when we have all the
[1:11:26] support to rest on a stay hard to stand
[1:11:32] but this man had to stand alone
[1:11:40] praise the Lord amen
[1:11:50] and God is saying even if they were
[1:11:53] there if they were if they were now yet
[1:11:56] in this age the righteousness will only
[1:12:02] be sufficient for the alone
[1:12:11] praise the Lord or sometimes we want to
[1:12:17] think maybe our our our you know husband
[1:12:24] is a preacher or our wife is this or our
[1:12:27] you know you can go on there you have to
[1:12:29] get your own personal experience it's a
[1:12:39] blessed thing when when when the wife
[1:12:41] can have an experience with God and she
[1:12:44] know the Word of God and the husband can
[1:12:47] happen experience with God in the day
[1:12:49] where when one feeling another one can
[1:12:51] be able to encourage himself living in a
[1:12:56] society worthy you know we might just I
[1:12:59] mean please one another you know yeah
[1:13:01] honey if that's why you say okay that's
[1:13:05] the kind of asset I mean situation that
[1:13:07] we are in so a whole home would just go
[1:13:12] straight under the rock or go in a flaw
[1:13:14] because really there is nobody standing
[1:13:17] we just only pleasing pleasing
[1:13:29] praise the Lord but there's something
[1:13:32] that caught my attention here I'm
[1:13:34] getting out of time a little bit
[1:13:39] let's read we pick up we stopped dead on
[1:13:43] verse 17 or if I bring a swarm swarm
[1:13:48] upon the lane and said sward go through
[1:13:53] the lane so that I cut off men and
[1:13:56] beasts from it though these three were
[1:13:59] in it as I left said the Lord they shall
[1:14:02] deliver neither songs or daughter need a
[1:14:06] son or daughter so even Noah songs how
[1:14:11] to get a revelation of what their father
[1:14:13] was saying they never only came into the
[1:14:17] act because their fathers say coming to
[1:14:19] the eyes they had to get a revelation
[1:14:44] but then owner shall be delivered
[1:14:47] himself or I send pestilence
[1:14:50] into the lane and pour out my fur and
[1:14:54] upon it in blood to cut off from it men
[1:14:59] and beasts though lowered on your job
[1:15:03] way in it as us as I left said the Lord
[1:15:07] God they shall deliver need a son or non
[1:15:11] daughter they but deliver their own soul
[1:15:15] by the earth righteousness amen that's
[1:15:23] reason why we must encourage our
[1:15:25] children to the new birth amen
[1:15:29] we must encourage them but that said the
[1:15:38] Lord God how much more when I send my
[1:15:41] false cold judgment upon Jerusalem where
[1:15:48] is the false cold judgment the swore the
[1:15:52] farming not zombies and pestilence to
[1:15:59] cut the lane are we together
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:11] now to Israel you look through the
[1:16:17] scripture or through the scripture all
[1:16:21] through the scripture it was either one
[1:16:23] or the other one of these things God
[1:16:27] always used to get his people back into
[1:16:32] the adjoining he either bring it upon
[1:16:35] them to rebuke them punish them and get
[1:16:39] them back to to start seeking the face
[1:16:40] of God get him back to start calling
[1:16:43] upon God how are we together like better
[1:16:51] Bentham says Satan is just like a whip
[1:16:53] in the hands of God now so we realized
[1:16:56] here I to the church in the natural word
[1:17:02] we will see these things happening but
[1:17:05] it came to the church in a spiritual
[1:17:09] form he looked over in Revelation
[1:17:11] chapter 6 Revelation chapter 6 speaks to
[1:17:17] us of the praise the Lord
[1:17:29] religion chapter 6 and I saw when the
[1:17:33] lamb opened one of the seal I heard as
[1:17:37] it were the noise of thunder one of the
[1:17:41] four beasts saying come and see
[1:17:44] and I saw and beheld the white house and
[1:17:53] he that sat on it had a bow and a crown
[1:17:58] was given unto him and he went forth
[1:18:00] conquering and to conquer now you have
[1:18:04] to watch the way that God is with Israel
[1:18:09] in the natural he also deals with the
[1:18:13] church in the spiritual amen now so the
[1:18:22] things the happy
[1:18:23] to Israel in the natural always come to
[1:18:27] us the Redeem Church in the spiritual
[1:18:33] amen
[1:18:35] Israel inheritance was and natural in
[1:18:38] everything's our inheritance is a
[1:18:41] spiritual inheritance are we together
[1:18:50] now and just like how God said to Israel
[1:18:54] year telling him there he he called it I
[1:19:01] like the way the scripture said in here
[1:19:04] a full school judgment praise the Lord
[1:19:13] a force called judgment and now you have
[1:19:19] to realize and that's the two things
[1:19:21] that follow the opening of the seal
[1:19:24] judgment and mercy
[1:19:31] praise the Lord amen and just like
[1:19:36] Israel whenever God brings any of these
[1:19:41] judgment upon him whenever he brings
[1:19:45] judgment when when David number the
[1:19:48] people and God was not happy with David
[1:19:53] an angel of the Lord came down praise
[1:19:58] the Lord and what did he said he
[1:20:02] pronounced judgment to David he said
[1:20:05] even though either I would commit you in
[1:20:07] the hands of your enemy by war or I
[1:20:09] would bring farming upon the lame or I
[1:20:13] will bring pestilence upon the land
[1:20:15] praise the Lord
[1:20:17] but what happened given you that
[1:20:21] whenever judgment comes there is always
[1:20:24] a little door for mercy praise the Lord
[1:20:33] and we together because you see it's
[1:20:38] almost like the like like the believer
[1:20:41] when God takes us through trial what I
[1:20:44] was trying for like the scripture says
[1:20:46] is to purified us is to bring us our
[1:20:49] more stronger is to bring it out as God
[1:20:52] that's the same way when God brings
[1:20:54] judgment upon the leg is to set the
[1:20:56] people back into the mines for the
[1:20:58] journey I mean and so call the redeemed
[1:21:02] out is to open the eyes of the people
[1:21:03] it's to get down to that to that
[1:21:07] predestinated seed in the heart of the
[1:21:09] Ilia for them to start seeking the face
[1:21:11] of God and start looking for mercy
[1:21:15] praise the Lord and the ones that don't
[1:21:19] have no knowledge of mercy they get wept
[1:21:22] out in the Josh manner
[1:21:24] praise the Lord is that seed of God in
[1:21:29] your heart that make you to cry for
[1:21:31] mercy whenever there is judgment
[1:21:34] amen whenever there's sickness upon your
[1:21:37] body you say O God have mercy upon me it
[1:21:41] ain't going wrong o God have mercy upon
[1:21:43] me praise the Lord
[1:21:51] that's the two things that follow the
[1:21:54] opening of the seal you find there as
[1:21:56] you go through the book of Revelation
[1:21:58] we're not dealing on the seals tonight
[1:22:00] but I'm trying to help you help us to
[1:22:02] see that just like God had those four
[1:22:06] squirt a judgment that he deal with
[1:22:10] Israel is all through the scripture as
[1:22:12] I've said is the same thing applied to
[1:22:14] the church amen now so all of the seals
[1:22:20] are the opening of the seals going I
[1:22:23] give us an understanding that just like
[1:22:26] he'd air with Israel naturally
[1:22:29] spiritually right from the Church of
[1:22:31] Jerusalem to the church our goals
[1:22:33] completely in the rapture God has been
[1:22:37] dealing with the people spiritually
[1:22:45] are we together you think about thing
[1:22:53] about it right there in the book of odds
[1:22:55] the Holy Ghost had just felt these
[1:22:57] people has God a fresh experience from
[1:23:00] God the pillar of fire coming down in
[1:23:04] the upper room literally seeing God and
[1:23:07] flaming the hearts I mean that the ones
[1:23:10] that were quiet and I mean that the dry
[1:23:13] eye Christian were all crying the ones
[1:23:15] that were quieter were all shouting and
[1:23:17] praising God the ones that you think
[1:23:19] they're not had no bones in your body
[1:23:21] the hands were all lifting or thanking
[1:23:23] God and speaking in tongues agreed a
[1:23:29] move of God amen but it would not be too
[1:23:35] long
[1:23:36] they will start whipping them in the
[1:23:38] public it will start arresting them and
[1:23:43] giving them public whip praise the Lord
[1:23:50] what was happening it was a cannibal
[1:23:55] spiritual attack on the church because
[1:23:59] remember bird balances when I see you
[1:24:01] openly declare war whenever God does
[1:24:04] something in the midst of the people it
[1:24:06] declares war amen when we prayed and God
[1:24:10] answered our prayer you get ready for
[1:24:12] more of the devil to come that is the
[1:24:20] reason why I'm encouraging you you
[1:24:23] better get back to your praying closet
[1:24:30] praise the Lord
[1:24:33] find time to pray
[1:24:42] because I'm telling you there is a shake
[1:24:45] that is going to come that is going to
[1:24:50] shake and you need a unshakable stand
[1:24:55] just like Paul says everything that can
[1:25:03] be shaped will be shaken now so we see
[1:25:09] you're writing us in in the scripture
[1:25:12] we're going to have just like we had for
[1:25:17] anointing the scripture called them
[1:25:21] beasts and arrived from Ezekiel they are
[1:25:24] called
[1:25:24] living creatures but actually they are
[1:25:27] for anointing that is given to the
[1:25:28] church for the church protection we also
[1:25:32] have there is also what is called the
[1:25:43] hospital
[1:25:45] amen but Brenham help us to understand
[1:25:53] there from the message countdown okay my
[1:26:00] time was to be out him from the message
[1:26:03] countdown when he talks on the message
[1:26:06] countdown what actually he was teaching
[1:26:08] was the the gathering of of power that I
[1:26:14] mean the the knowledge there to realize
[1:26:17] the other goal gave these hearses these
[1:26:22] beasts you know power to be able I mean
[1:26:26] to plot the field to be able to
[1:26:28] transport man and and and you know
[1:26:30] someone grabbed the revelation and
[1:26:34] realized that if I can be able to be a
[1:26:36] little card and set it and set it behind
[1:26:39] a hearse put wheels on it my hearse can
[1:26:41] be able to carry me it's this this beast
[1:26:44] has a power now sober Branham was was
[1:26:47] was teaching us to realize that man in
[1:26:51] his mind in his falling knowledge was
[1:26:54] able to grab there
[1:26:56] that the Beast the animal has power
[1:26:59] instead of just holding the ground and
[1:27:01] breaking a water Bay they were able to
[1:27:03] build instrument and put it on the
[1:27:05] shoulders of cows to be able to tell the
[1:27:08] ground and make big feet
[1:27:09] I mean that the power that is put that
[1:27:12] is that is in when you put two animals
[1:27:14] together that the more work that can be
[1:27:16] able to do now he was he was using that
[1:27:19] in a type to be able to show that is the
[1:27:22] same way that a God also has given power
[1:27:26] to the church are we together now so you
[1:27:35] see this horse rather in a book of
[1:27:37] Revelation is also talking about a power
[1:27:40] that is coming against the church and
[1:27:45] the living creatures are also speaking
[1:27:48] about the spiritual power that the
[1:27:51] church also have are we together now you
[1:27:57] have to remember the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:28:00] to to Zerubbabel that is Napa might it's
[1:28:04] neither power but it's by his Spirit I
[1:28:09] mean so it's not in a physical power and
[1:28:14] strain or anything that the church can
[1:28:15] be able to do it's in the power that
[1:28:21] comes from God's Word are we together so
[1:28:29] just like how is shown here that's what
[1:28:32] Bob Arum was teaching in the message
[1:28:33] count down how the church has been
[1:28:39] moving in strength to strength just like
[1:28:43] how science has been advancing from the
[1:28:47] hearses to an automobile amen
[1:28:53] seeing how the horses were I mean a fair
[1:28:59] rehearsal school I mean cool ramen and
[1:29:02] and I mean
[1:29:04] and seeing how those basic applauded a
[1:29:07] field man was able to gather that an
[1:29:13] increase strength talk to mechanism to
[1:29:20] be able to make an engine of a car to go
[1:29:24] more then a hearse can go amen
[1:29:30] and then when he make an aeroplane he
[1:29:33] was able to increase the power for the
[1:29:36] plane to go low then the vehicle can go
[1:29:41] now when he goes went into space with an
[1:29:45] atomic racket he only increased the
[1:29:48] horsepower that the atomic plane can go
[1:29:53] faster than your Delta airline can go
[1:29:59] now so brother Branham was teaching us
[1:30:02] that man could only achieve that because
[1:30:05] it was the same thing that God did in
[1:30:07] the spiritual I mean he was teaching us
[1:30:17] that's what God did in the spiritual
[1:30:20] through the church ages the more the
[1:30:24] church was advancing the more power amen
[1:30:32] are we together
[1:30:37] the first anointing I was on the church
[1:30:50] before anointing was the man's anointing
[1:30:57] the arc sine moiety the ego anointing
[1:31:05] and which one the lion anointing so each
[1:31:12] of this anointing had enough power to be
[1:31:17] able to preserve the church the first
[1:31:19] three Church ages was under the Lions
[1:31:22] anointing that was the ages were great
[1:31:25] in the moving out of the gospel that's
[1:31:31] the reason why when the persecution came
[1:31:33] on the church they had to spread about
[1:31:38] you remember in the book of Acts the
[1:31:41] people were selling their land and
[1:31:43] bringing all their all their well-being
[1:31:45] to the feet of the apostille why were
[1:31:49] they trying to do they were trying to
[1:31:50] settle down now they have seen the power
[1:31:53] of God yeah we are coming to Saturday I
[1:31:55] can say all my leg I mean the power of
[1:31:58] God is in this place Peter by his shadow
[1:32:00] we are being healed I mean I mean we
[1:32:05] just saw Ananias and Sapphira died from
[1:32:08] being dis earners the power of God is so
[1:32:10] much they were about to settle down God
[1:32:12] said it's not time to settle them so
[1:32:19] what he had to do bring great
[1:32:21] persecution upon the church and the
[1:32:23] people scattered bad and the gospel
[1:32:25] started going around the world there was
[1:32:31] the lion's anointing so there was there
[1:32:34] was enough power that's the reason why I
[1:32:38] Paul calling died being bit by a second
[1:32:41] because there was enough power in the
[1:32:43] church are we together when it came to
[1:32:51] the time of the persecution under the
[1:32:54] axe anointing they were also enough
[1:32:56] power for people to hold to their faith
[1:33:00] and walk to the Lions Den they had
[1:33:03] enough power praise the Lord
[1:33:10] another one that we don't have fit for
[1:33:12] the two egg library Baraboo say offer a
[1:33:23] headache but these people they I mean
[1:33:27] ago it was the anointing that was on the
[1:33:30] church under the Foxy Brown says the
[1:33:32] church couldn't do anything but just to
[1:33:34] respond to her anointing we don't have
[1:33:41] that we don't have that anointing in
[1:33:46] this age this age is an ego sonority
[1:33:49] it's a it's a is I mean is it's the
[1:33:53] anointing year is to fly away praise the
[1:33:57] Lord
[1:33:58] amen no one astronaut trouble comes in a
[1:34:02] church people start flying away praise
[1:34:07] the Lord
[1:34:13] you only responded to your anointing I
[1:34:19] can blame you you don't have the
[1:34:25] anointing to die
[1:34:27] so you just fly away but what are we
[1:34:34] trying to say this is just to be able to
[1:34:36] show the power the power that was moving
[1:34:42] the church because there was a power
[1:34:45] that was coming against the church are
[1:34:51] we together
[1:34:56] that's what I'm trying to show you so
[1:35:04] just like how God was was dealing with
[1:35:09] his rating and natural so here we see
[1:35:13] under the first church age we had a we
[1:35:19] had a a horrible year a power that was
[1:35:23] coming against the church and and and
[1:35:26] and this power that was coming against
[1:35:28] the church if we take it honor the full
[1:35:34] skull Josh mean what was the force
[1:35:39] called Josh mini-game anybody remember
[1:35:43] we just read in Ezekiel swirl wishes war
[1:35:49] famine pestilence sickness and now
[1:35:54] zombies so that we take if we take it
[1:35:59] under the false code judgment here we
[1:36:02] have a beast a man with with he has a
[1:36:08] board he's declaring war against the
[1:36:12] church amen
[1:36:19] he's declaring war against the church in
[1:36:24] honor honor the Ox anointing we have a
[1:36:32] rare house rather and power was given
[1:36:36] unto him they are sat on it to take
[1:36:39] peace from the earth now if you go back
[1:36:42] to the Book of Ezekiel the the the the
[1:36:46] nose the nose on beasts you know was
[1:36:50] worth a wide Anna mercy you know coming
[1:36:58] and drop the people from the land all
[1:37:01] sometimes during the time of famine the
[1:37:05] locals would come you know and eat all
[1:37:09] the across
[1:37:10] just like the time of affair of frogs
[1:37:13] jumping in their plates on their bed and
[1:37:18] making man to leave the city and run
[1:37:20] into the mountains
[1:37:24] gaku okay cool thinking even you sir are
[1:37:28] flies to drive the people away amen
[1:37:40] I'm gonna trying to bring out these
[1:37:42] things so you can be able to see that
[1:37:45] just like how God be with Israel in the
[1:37:47] natural the same thing has been
[1:37:49] happening to the church but in a
[1:37:51] spiritual way
[1:37:53] now when brother Branham taught the
[1:37:57] seals he was dealing with with the most
[1:38:00] spiritual things that were happening to
[1:38:02] the church amen
[1:38:08] in the spiritual way that the Antichrist
[1:38:12] power was attacking the church the third
[1:38:20] beast what was this work to do a measure
[1:38:29] of wheat now if you if you look at a
[1:38:33] measure of wheat and all what will you
[1:38:37] take that on a farm
[1:38:42] amen
[1:38:44] because a measure of wheat if wheat is
[1:38:47] becoming so expensive which mean there
[1:38:49] is a drought in the lane glory be to God
[1:39:05] Amen now watch watch this here in
[1:39:11] Revelation chapter 6 verse 8 let me let
[1:39:14] me try to to close up here I can take
[1:39:16] the whole night to preach this I'm kind
[1:39:21] of all straighten a little bit out of my
[1:39:23] my toes tonight but that's fine verse
[1:39:31] seven and when he opened the fourth seal
[1:39:34] I heard the voice of the fourth beast
[1:39:38] say come and see
[1:39:44] there are four beasts there are four
[1:39:47] power that was calling to come and see
[1:39:50] is the Eagles anointing and our Lord and
[1:39:54] behold at Pihl house and his name that
[1:40:00] sat on him was death and hell
[1:40:05] follow him and he and and power was
[1:40:09] given unto him power was given unto them
[1:40:14] over the fourth part of the earth to
[1:40:17] kill with sword and with hunger and with
[1:40:24] death and with the beasts of the earth
[1:40:32] now you take salt hunger death and the
[1:40:37] beasts of the earth take it back to
[1:40:39] Ezekiel chapter 14 you will see your
[1:40:43] force call judgment
[1:40:51] are we together amen the night will not
[1:41:01] allow us to go through all of these
[1:41:02] things if the Lord keep the toad on our
[1:41:08] heart will continue on a Sunday if not
[1:41:09] we will try to follow what he want us to
[1:41:12] do but the reason why I try to bring
[1:41:21] this tonight
[1:41:28] it's for us to encourage ourself and
[1:41:37] realize that we are not in a picnic this
[1:41:42] is not a happy go game we are playing
[1:41:46] where we just want everybody to come
[1:41:48] along let's be happy this is time where
[1:41:53] we have to know where we stand with God
[1:42:01] praise the Lord because I'll tell you
[1:42:05] there is not a day that goes by that God
[1:42:09] don't speak to you there was not a day
[1:42:17] that goes by right 4:00 in the morning
[1:42:21] when he wakes us up for us to come out
[1:42:25] of sleep he calls you by name it's not
[1:42:29] your alarm that wakes you up I will tell
[1:42:32] you take your alarm to the grave and see
[1:42:34] if you'll wake those people up
[1:43:02] when we wake up it's so easy for us to
[1:43:07] get consumed into the daily activity
[1:43:13] because our Facebook feed is failed the
[1:43:19] phone is there with lot of messages on
[1:43:21] it and things are popping up and down
[1:43:25] and we don't even acknowledge the one
[1:43:27] that caught us by name
[1:43:39] around for our phone the young people we
[1:43:42] want to see won't post this morning that
[1:43:46] the first thing that run through our
[1:43:48] mind and then we get caught up into our
[1:43:54] our religious recitation the same thing
[1:44:00] we said to the Lord yesterday is the
[1:44:02] same thing we say today if those three
[1:44:08] men when in this age even your
[1:44:12] righteousness will not stop the wrath of
[1:44:15] God for the thing that is coming upon
[1:44:18] the lane the judgment that is coming
[1:44:21] upon the lane the name of God has been
[1:44:30] blunt Fame wickedness is who is rotting
[1:44:38] out like a mighty floor I mean is
[1:44:42] swallowing the people has never been on
[1:44:48] an increase where parents are taking
[1:44:51] their own children life it's just like
[1:44:54] in a book of Kings where they were
[1:44:56] offering their children to fire it's
[1:45:02] never been like that
[1:45:21] even if those three men were year they
[1:45:24] can never start this age from the wrath
[1:45:27] of God there is evil that is eating the
[1:45:33] heart of man every day it's eating the
[1:45:40] heart of man and if you have the grace
[1:45:43] of God speaking to your heart you better
[1:45:47] count yourself a privileged person and
[1:45:52] listening to the still small voice and
[1:45:56] do what the Lord is bidding you to do
[1:45:59] and get away from the things that he's
