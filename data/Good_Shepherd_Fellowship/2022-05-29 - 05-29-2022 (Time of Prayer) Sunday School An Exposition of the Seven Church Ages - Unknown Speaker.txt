TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so so [Music] there then must come upon the scene in this age those who will bring the wheat and tears to maturity the tares are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turned the people from the word but the wheat also must mature and to her god is sending the prophet messenger with the vindicated ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church heard paul and she will mature in the word until becoming a word bride the mighty works will be found in her that are always attendant upon the pure word and faith the false church groups will come together in a world council of churches this world council of churches is the image erected to the beast revelation 13 11-18 and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and caused that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six now remember it was imperial pagan rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of her deathstroke when she joined to the nominal christian church of rome and incorporated paganism and christianity and thereby became the holy roman empire which was to endure until jesus came and destroyed her but rome is not going it alone her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute authority by the world council of churches this may seem far-fetched to some but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control this ecumenical move will end up with rome at the head even though the people did not envision it that way this is so because in revelation 17 3 through 6 it states that the mystery babylon is seated on the beast she is controlling the last or fourth empire this roman church is doing that with the world church system under her rome will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to rome because rome controls the gold of the world thus all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or head this mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system which is trinitarianism etc and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the world church with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his pride for the great marriage supper of the lamb now as this concluding chapter was given in order to trace the two churches and two spirits from pentecost to their consummation we will take this final time to show this in the laodicean age this age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power the believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying to god for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the holy ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did remember while jesus was upon earth so was judas each came from a different spirit and upon death each went to his own place the spirit of christ later came back upon the true church and the spirit of judas came back upon the false church it is right there in revelation six one through eight and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth see how that judas spirit came back as a writer on a white horse it was white so close to the real just as judas was so close to jesus a crown was given to him white horse rider how that spirit was now in the leader of the nicolaitan system and he was a triple crowned pope who sat as god in his temple calling himself the vicar of christ if vicar of christ means instead of christ or in place of or on behalf of god then the pope was calling himself the holy ghost or deposing the holy ghost acting for him that was the judas spirit in him doing that see how he conquered going forth conquering and to conquer christ did not do that the only ones that came to him were already predestinated by the father and so on and on went that spirit and one day it will become truly incarnate in a man who will head up the world council of churches just as we have been saying and by his gold remember judas held the bag he will control the whole world and that antichrist system will own everything and try to control everybody but jesus will come back and destroy them all with the brightness of his coming and their end will be the lake of fire but what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of god are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the lord it is thus saith the lord for that is what joel 2 23-26 says be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he have given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the canker worms and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i send among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed now it says god is going to restore the lutheran age did not restore the church it started a reformation the wesleyan age did not restore the pentecostal age did not restore but god has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration god will take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration the locust canker worm caterpillar and palmer worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false doctrine through the ages and that poor little root and stock is going to be restored god isn't going to plant a new church but is going to bring his original planting back to original seed he is doing it as started in verse 23 by the teaching or former reign next will come the harvest reign or rapturing faith thus at this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of matthew 24 24 in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and who is it that shall attempt to deceive the very elect why the spirit of antichrist in the false anointed ones of this last day these false ones have already come in jesus name claiming that they have been anointed of god for the last day they are the false messiahs anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but are they one with the word never they have added to it or taken from it no one denies that the spirit of god manifesting in gifts is upon them but like balaam they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of god just like judas with a ministry imparted by christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have a wrong spirit motivating them religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and zeal but it is laodicean not of christ for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them they preach the second coming of christ but deny the advent of the prophet messenger though in power and signs and true revelation he eclipses them all ah yes this false spirit that in the last day is so close to the real can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word and whenever it is caught in being anti-word it falls back on the one argument we have already shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of god now before we close i want to bring this thought all along we have been talking about the seed of wheat being buried then sending up two shoots then the tassel then the true ear this might make some wonder if we said that the lutherans didn't have the holy spirit just because they taught basically justification it might make some wonder about the methodists etc no sir we are not saying that we are not talking about the individuals or the people but the age luther had the spirit of god but his age was not the age of full restoration by another outpouring like in the beginning it was the same with wesley booth knox whitefield brainerd jonathan edwards mueller etc surely they were full of the holy ghost yes they certainly were but the age in which each lived was not the age of restoration neither was any age but this last age the age of complete blackout in apostasy this is the age of apostasy and this is the age of restoration it is the age of the finished cycle with this it is all over so we conclude the seven church ages saying only what the spirit said to each age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches i sincerely believe that the spirit of god has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truths of the ages but he has been faithfully dealing with hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of god and follow him not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization i have never done that and will not do that now i have no interest in those things but i do have an interest in the things of god and people and if i can accomplish just one thing i will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between god and men for in man become new creations in christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word i would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as i trust in my heart that i have given my all to him god bless you and may his coming rejoice your heart [Music] you
