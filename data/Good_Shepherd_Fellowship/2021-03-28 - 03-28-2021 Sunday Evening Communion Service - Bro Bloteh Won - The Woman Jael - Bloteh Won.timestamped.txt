[26:58] thought i call the woman jail
[27:01] amen the woman jail
[27:08] well before i talk about that wonderful
[27:11] character and gillian woman i want us to
[27:14] just look at
[27:16] a scripture in the book of isaiah
[27:20] let's look together
[27:23] in the book of isaiah chapter 22.
[27:29] let's look together in the book of
[27:31] isaiah chapter 22.
[27:40] isaiah chapter 22 all praise the lord
[27:47] it's so wonderful to serve the lord
[27:50] amen it's a good thing to say of the
[27:53] lord
[27:55] praise the lord amen let's look at a
[27:58] little prophecy here
[28:00] that is that that uh
[28:04] uh it might come a little bit strange to
[28:06] many of us but it's the word of the lord
[28:09] and we pray that the lord will
[28:12] be able to to bless us tonight as we
[28:15] look at this together
[28:16] isaiah chapter 22 let's read from verse
[28:18] 22
[28:22] praise the lord
[28:25] you know no wonder god sent us a prophet
[28:28] and i believe it was in god's design
[28:30] that brother branham would be
[28:32] you know uneducated so god will be able
[28:36] to channel through
[28:38] that life and gift for us to be able to
[28:41] enjoy
[28:42] uh the types and shadow
[28:45] because that was the best way that
[28:47] brother branham could express himself
[28:49] through the scripture
[28:50] was typed in shadow and paul learned
[28:53] that
[28:53] when he wrote the book of hebrew you
[28:56] know uh
[28:57] uh uh you know like brandon said he says
[29:01] uh you know god
[29:02] when god dared with paul three and a
[29:04] half years he spent on the backside of
[29:06] the
[29:07] of arabia and what he was doing is that
[29:10] he was
[29:11] looking in the old testament that he had
[29:13] steady under gamilia
[29:15] that boy was cool you know paul was very
[29:17] privileged
[29:18] you know he he had a father that took a
[29:21] roman citizenship
[29:23] so he had good form of education paul
[29:25] was educated
[29:26] and so he was really schooled very
[29:30] school
[29:30] very very smart and
[29:33] but god had to grab him in their
[29:36] smartness
[29:37] and then when when the lord met him on
[29:39] the road
[29:40] uh of of damascus
[29:44] you know the lord said to him
[29:48] it's hard for you to kick against the
[29:50] praise now keep that word in your mind
[29:52] because i'm going to use that tonight
[29:55] so but paul when he found himself at the
[29:59] back side of the desert he
[30:01] he went back and started reading from
[30:03] genesis
[30:04] he started reading from the beginning of
[30:06] creation
[30:08] because it was so striking the thing
[30:10] that blew his mind
[30:11] is for the pillar of fire to take a
[30:14] personal identification
[30:16] and say i'm jesus that thing blew
[30:19] paul's mind that thing took him from on
[30:21] his heart
[30:23] that he was writing praise the lord i
[30:26] mean
[30:26] it blew his mind so he had to go back
[30:29] and start reading from genesis all true
[30:33] and i believe as he was reading from
[30:36] genesis
[30:36] he saw the tree of life he shouted oh
[30:39] jesus
[30:40] he saw the the the cherubin he shouted
[30:43] jesus
[30:44] he saw the the abyss sacrifice he said
[30:46] oh that's jesus
[30:47] he saw the abraham sacrificing i mean
[30:50] jesus was just popping out of the bible
[30:52] everywhere for paul
[30:55] and that's what happened when god opened
[30:57] your understanding
[30:58] i mean he pops up every word the most
[31:01] strange scripture in the bible
[31:03] jesus will just pop up because the
[31:05] prophet of god says if you read
[31:07] and you don't find jesus go back and
[31:09] read again because
[31:10] jesus is here right in the scripture
[31:16] praise the lord even in noah's ark he
[31:19] could see jesus
[31:23] jesus was popping all over the bible
[31:26] that's what happened when you fall in
[31:28] love with the bible
[31:30] you read the word of god jesus flies
[31:32] from everywhere
[31:34] the most strange scripture in the bible
[31:37] he's going to tell you i'm right here
[31:41] he's head in simplicity praise the lord
[31:45] and he's revealed in the scene verse 22
[31:47] let's read him
[31:48] and the kid of the house of david
[31:52] the key of the house of devin
[31:55] you think about that because this
[31:58] particular scripture will show itself up
[32:00] in the book of revelation
[32:02] into the church ages and that was one of
[32:05] the identification of jesus christ
[32:08] to the church ages praise the lord
[32:16] and the key of the house of david
[32:20] will are laid upon his shoulder
[32:25] and he shall open and none
[32:28] shall short and he shall
[32:31] shut and none shall open
[32:35] is that familiar to you that's jesus
[32:40] praise the lord verse 23
[32:44] and i will fast in him
[32:47] as a male the same one that is the king
[32:50] of david
[32:52] is now a nail amen
[32:57] and our fasting him
[33:01] as a nail in a short place
[33:07] praise the lord in a short place
[33:13] a short place is also a chosen place
[33:18] amen our fasting him
[33:22] as a nail in the show place and he
[33:25] shall be for a glorious throne
[33:30] to his father's house
[33:34] praise the lord i will fast to him
[33:38] as a nail and he shall be for a glorious
[33:41] throne to his father's house
[33:43] and they shall hang upon him
[33:47] all the glory of his father's house
[33:53] no water we started putting nail at the
[33:56] back of our door for us to hand our
[33:57] clothes
[34:00] because we are all hanging on him
[34:04] praise the lord amen that's why they
[34:07] were using before all the designer came
[34:09] with these nice hangers that they are
[34:11] nailing
[34:12] at the back of the door hanging at the
[34:13] back of the door it was nails that he
[34:15] used to use
[34:18] glory be to god amen
[34:21] and then shall hang upon him all the
[34:23] glory
[34:25] of his father's house is hanged on him
[34:31] all the glory of his
[34:34] father's house is hank on him
[34:38] jesus said after we have done everything
[34:41] that we know how to do we say we are
[34:42] unprofitable
[34:44] because all the glory is hanged on him
[34:51] praise the lord the offspring
[34:56] and the issue all vessels
[35:00] of small quantities
[35:03] from the vessel of cup
[35:06] even to all the vessel
[35:10] of flagon now you understand why paul in
[35:13] the book of hebrew he says that
[35:16] he saw why all the instrument
[35:19] in the temple was sanctified with blood
[35:21] he said everything that was used
[35:23] in the in the in the in the temple they
[35:26] had to sprinkle blood
[35:27] of the testimony when the blood was
[35:29] missed with the house of the high priest
[35:31] came
[35:31] and he spring it on the drums because
[35:33] they need to be sanctified
[35:34] he springer on the piano on on the
[35:36] violin make sure that everything is
[35:39] covered by blood
[35:40] he sprinkled on the word and then he
[35:43] spring it
[35:43] on the people
[35:48] because all the vessel verse 25
[35:52] in that day said the lord of hosts
[35:56] shall the mail that is fasting
[36:01] in the show place be removed
[36:05] and cut down
[36:08] and fall and the burden
[36:11] that was upon it shall be cut off
[36:15] for the lord have spoken it
[36:19] all our sin was nailed to the cross
[36:22] all our sickness burden was hanged on
[36:25] him
[36:26] and it shall be cut off after he has
[36:28] made transgression
[36:30] for the people this was a prophecy of
[36:34] jesus christ
[36:36] in his death
[36:40] amen are we together tonight
[36:43] praise the lord let's study this a
[36:46] little bit then we will get into what we
[36:47] want to talk about here
[36:49] i will not bold you amen
[36:54] praise the lord
[37:01] love the lord tonight amen
[37:05] now as you look at this you will realize
[37:08] that
[37:15] you realize that it comes it comes
[37:18] wonderful because
[37:19] when god plays something in his word
[37:22] he place it there in a unique way when
[37:25] it's taking an identification because
[37:27] pretty soon you will realize
[37:29] that that's the way that god's designed
[37:32] it
[37:32] let's look in the book of ezra ezra
[37:35] chapter 9.
[37:48] brother branham read this scripture when
[37:49] he preached the message the blushing
[37:51] prophet
[37:52] verse 6 and say oh my god i'm ashamed
[37:56] and i blush to to lift up my face today
[38:00] oh my god for our iniquity
[38:04] our increase over
[38:07] our head and our trespasses
[38:11] i've grown up unto the heavens since the
[38:15] days of our fathers
[38:18] have we been in a great trespass onto
[38:21] on to this day and for our iniquity
[38:26] and for our iniquity have we our kings
[38:30] our priests being delivered into the
[38:32] hands of the kings of the land
[38:34] to the sword to to captivity to the
[38:37] spoils
[38:38] and to to come to confusion of faith
[38:42] as it is this day and now
[38:45] for a little space of grace
[38:49] have dare shown from the lord our god
[38:54] to leave us a woman to escape
[38:58] and to give us a meal
[39:02] in his holy place
[39:05] and to give us a nail was this just
[39:09] a nail that the capital would come and
[39:11] nail no
[39:12] it was the same nail the isaiah
[39:14] prophesied about
[39:17] and to give us a nail
[39:20] in the holy place and what makes it
[39:23] unique
[39:24] is that when you look through the
[39:25] scripture every time
[39:27] the male year was representing a person
[39:30] which is jesus christ
[39:31] there was no s added to it
[39:36] every time in the scripture
[39:41] praise the lord
[39:53] and now for a little space of grace
[39:58] have been shown from the lord our god
[40:01] to leave us a raymond to escape and to
[40:04] give
[40:05] us a nail in his holy place
[40:08] that our god may
[40:11] may lighten our eyes and give
[40:15] us a little reviving
[40:18] in our bunnies praise the lord
[40:22] even though we're going through this
[40:24] this uh
[40:25] uh cove igniting uh pandemic and water
[40:28] there but god
[40:30] is able to give us reviving
[40:34] praise the lord amen covey 19 can give
[40:39] us church or distance put max
[40:41] on our face but it should not take our
[40:43] revival away
[40:46] praise the lord it should not take our
[40:48] revival because our revival is in the
[40:50] word there's a nail
[40:52] in the holy place there's a nail in the
[40:55] show place
[41:00] that we can hang our burden
[41:04] we can hang our weaknesses
[41:08] praise the lord we can hang our
[41:11] sicknesses
[41:14] you can even hang yourself on it
[41:18] it's in a short place it's in a short
[41:19] position you don't
[41:21] you don't have a weight that that the
[41:23] nail cannot take
[41:30] are we together
[41:34] let's look in zacharias
[41:39] zechariah's chapter 10.
[41:56] zechariah's chapter 10 verse 3 my
[41:59] anger is counted against the shepherd
[42:01] and
[42:02] and i punish the gods for the lord of
[42:05] hosts have visited the floor
[42:07] of the house of judah and have made them
[42:10] as
[42:11] his garlic hers in battle out
[42:14] of him king fought
[42:18] the conan out of him the nail
[42:21] out of him
[42:24] the battle board out of him
[42:28] every oppressor together
[42:33] amen
[42:36] now so we see this and we can look at
[42:39] this all through the scripture
[42:41] you know it was it was it was kind of a
[42:44] beautiful
[42:46] you know when and now and brother
[42:48] branham said this
[42:50] i read this to you tonight out of the

[45:57] be she was a gentile
[46:02] amen blessed above women
[46:08] this woman jill oh praise the lord
[46:12] amen the story take us back to
[46:15] chapter four
[46:29] and the children of israel again did
[46:31] evil in the sight of the lord
[46:37] and there god raised up a prophetess
[46:43] deborah and deborah
[46:47] as a prophetess she could prophesy
[46:52] and she called barak
[46:56] and prophesy because uh uh caesarea
[47:00] the king the captain of of the king
[47:03] hazard
[47:04] from canada has come against israel
[47:08] so she called barrack and she told him
[47:11] have the lord that
[47:12] anointed thee for this you know and he
[47:15] says go in the name of the law
[47:17] barra said no until you go with me
[47:21] praise the lord he she said go
[47:26] for the matter of fact the lord is going
[47:29] to deliver us
[47:30] but this time is going to be by the hand
[47:33] of a woman
[47:36] praise the lord now you have to realize
[47:39] that
[47:40] george's it's a span of time in
[47:44] israel where there was no prophet
[47:48] joshua the prophet after moses or the
[47:51] leader after
[47:52] moses has has gone has left the people
[47:54] and
[47:55] it was a space of time where the prophet
[47:58] was not on the scene
[48:02] so jerry said that god was
[48:05] working through the body
[48:08] the stage of george's it is
[48:11] it is it is to give the new testament
[48:14] church
[48:14] an idea that god's desire is to work
[48:18] through the people
[48:20] that when god used moses as a prophet
[48:24] or god set up a priesthood with aaron
[48:27] and all the priests the people to do
[48:30] sacrifice the people to do
[48:32] other works it does not means that god
[48:34] will not work with those people
[48:36] god work with all his people
[48:41] praise the lord amen one thing that god
[48:45] hates
[48:45] is hierarchy go ahead every any form of
[48:49] hierarchy
[48:51] where you stop the power of god only in
[48:54] a certain group of people god don't work
[48:56] like that
[48:58] praise the lord the ministry has is
[49:01] placed
[49:02] the officer's heart there are places in
[49:04] the church
[49:05] but there is no form of hierarchy in the
[49:08] church of the living god
[49:10] we only have an order and we must
[49:12] respect that other
[49:14] but there is no form of hierarchy god
[49:17] can use
[49:18] anyone he can you his desire is to use
[49:22] every one of us if we can make ourselves
[49:25] available
[49:26] if we can stop being afraid if we can
[49:29] just put our heart and say lord
[49:31] if you can use anyone you can use me
[49:37] praise the lord
[49:41] amen that's the reason why we don't have
[49:43] no special cheer here for no
[49:45] pastor no bishop
[49:50] praise the lord if it's your time to
[49:54] speak you stand here when you are don't
[49:56] go and sit down
[49:59] listen to the next person
[50:05] praise the lord oh you know i don't i
[50:07] don't condem
[50:08] you know other people that have cheers
[50:11] you know and those other diminishers
[50:13] lining up coming on the pulpit they feel
[50:15] so special
[50:16] they are on a high puppy they can look
[50:18] in the congregation
[50:19] and sometimes it's a shame when you see
[50:21] them sleeping up there
[50:33] praise the lord let's get to business
[50:38] you
[50:41] and you see all through the book of
[50:44] george's
[50:45] how god used shame guy he was just a
[50:49] common farmer
[50:50] a common farmer he was not a military
[50:54] man he was not a priest he was not a
[50:56] prophet he was just a common
[50:58] a common hearseman and god used him
[51:02] because he felt inspired something came
[51:07] over him
[51:09] and he said no this have to end
[51:13] every time you make his farm and keep
[51:15] his harvest
[51:17] the philistines will come and take
[51:18] everything
[51:21] he had to take a stand
[51:24] god is looking for a man or a woman
[51:27] that we have the courage to stand
[51:31] and says enough is enough
[51:36] praise the lord he said
[51:39] enough is enough
[51:44] and god bless his little courage he hi
[51:49] praise the lord amen
[51:53] and the bible talks about this other man
[51:55] it all he was he was a left-handed man
[51:59] praise the lord and god used him
[52:02] so all through the scripture in the old
[52:05] testament shadow
[52:06] god designed a book of judges
[52:10] at a time where everybody was doing a
[52:13] calling to their heart there was no
[52:15] prophet
[52:15] in the land everybody was doing but yet
[52:17] in the midst of all of that confusion
[52:20] god was still raising the people
[52:26] and that is the reason why why god also
[52:30] anointed a a prophetess gift it was not
[52:33] to make deborah
[52:35] a preacher no but god
[52:38] was trying to show on a shadow
[52:42] that he can use his people
[52:45] with different gifts that's the reason
[52:48] why it was now
[52:49] only the uh hashem god it was not only a
[52:52] jeff tied it was now on a
[52:54] gideon but here we have a woman also
[53:00] we have a woman also because that's how
[53:03] god
[53:04] balanced his body that's how he balance
[53:07] his body
[53:08] is the expression of his full image
[53:12] male and female
[53:16] because in the last age in the final
[53:20] fight
[53:21] it would be a bright body that would
[53:23] stand against the devil
[53:27] praise the lord it will be christ
[53:30] in bright form
[53:34] christ standing in the midst of the
[53:36] church
[53:37] with his gather around his pipes
[53:46] praise the lord
[53:51] he took it from his shoulder as a priest
[53:53] and put it around his pipe
[53:57] now so we see here
[54:02] we have a barrack we have a deborah
[54:06] and this captain terrified
[54:09] israel
[54:14] and the scripture says as he as he went
[54:16] along
[54:17] you know terrifying the people barrack
[54:20] went and he gathered men he gathered
[54:23] a bunch of you know army and charities
[54:26] and everything to go and fight to
[54:27] deliver israel
[54:29] but the border has already given him a
[54:31] word
[54:33] praise the lord she has already given
[54:37] him a word
[54:41] that god will deliver israel
[54:44] by the hand of a woman
[54:48] praise the lord amen can you think about
[54:51] that
[54:54] that should be enough to inspire your
[54:57] heart
[54:59] amen that we are the final voice
[55:03] to the final age
[55:07] glory be to god and you can read the
[55:09] rest of the story the bible says
[55:12] and
[55:12] [Music]
[55:17] this gentleman he went
[55:20] sincere he went you know escaping away
[55:23] from barrack and the rest of them
[55:25] he went down and he met this woman jill
[55:28] that's that's a beautiful thing this
[55:30] that's a beautiful
[55:31] beautiful uh design here
[55:37] he met her and
[55:40] she welcomed him
[55:44] into her house
[55:47] she welcomed him
[55:50] she never threw him up and said so what
[55:53] are you doing here that i mean you are
[55:54] the one that is troubling the land
[55:56] i'm going to no she will come in
[56:00] praise the lord he asked for water

[56:10] does he relax
[56:11] you it's cool to get a glass of milk for
[56:14] you to sleep well
[56:15] try

[56:22] he asked for water and
[56:26] she gave him milk and even brought a
[56:29] loaf
[56:30] a nice big bread
[56:34] give him some comfort
[56:38] praise praise the lord you know peter
[56:40] said
[56:41] in the book of uh in this episode
[56:45] he says why the thing or speak
[56:49] evil of you he said you be
[56:52] nice to them he said because in that way
[56:56] you will burn a cord of fire
[56:58] right upon their head and that's what
[57:00] jill was doing
[57:03] she was beginning to roast his head
[57:09] she failed him give him a go
[57:12] a glass of milk and the scripture says
[57:23] amen and the scripture
[57:26] says that
[57:36] he even said to her if anyone come
[57:40] to pursue me and everyone asks for me
[57:42] you tell them you have not seen me
[57:44] you can read the entire chapter four i'm
[57:46] sure you're going to read it tonight
[57:48] amen and uh
[57:54] he went to sleep
[57:57] he went and got one of his covers
[58:03] she gave him a nice place to sleep
[58:08] god honored his covers and started to
[58:11] rest
[58:13] praise the lord amen
[58:17] as soon as she heard him blowing the
[58:19] trumpet
[58:20] i mean it's starting to snow
[58:25] because he has eaten some love his
[58:27] stomach is fought
[58:28] drank some milk and he's just there
[58:31] groaning and groaning
[58:33] all in beige
[58:37] the bible says she took a nail
[58:43] she never took nails she took a nail
[58:52] praise the lord she took a nail
[58:56] right to his temple
[59:01] and the bible says she fasting him to
[59:03] the ground
[59:08] praise the lord he never had the time to
[59:12] ask
[59:12] who are you or what are you doing
[59:16] because her hand was to the nail and the
[59:19] right hand to the hammond
[59:20] the works man hammered praise the lord
[59:27] see thou weak of vessel all trembling
[59:33] or shaking but you know that somebody
[59:36] has to bring
[59:40] this thing to an end
[59:43] praise the lord somebody has to take
[59:45] this turret away
[59:52] she never even heard deborah prophesied
[59:55] about her
[59:56] she never heard about it she was not
[59:58] saying i'm going to do this because
[1:00:00] deborah said a woman
[1:00:01] is going to no no she never even heard
[1:00:03] about it right
[1:00:09] she just decided to take on some courage
[1:00:15] just take on some courage
[1:00:20] to face her fear i bet you she was
[1:00:24] afraid
[1:00:26] because she knows that this is the man
[1:00:28] that is that is a terror in the land
[1:00:30] this
[1:00:30] is the guy that is terrifying the people
[1:00:38] but she just took some courage
[1:00:41] church that's all
[1:00:44] we need it's just to gather some courage
[1:00:51] and say you are the lord that heal me
[1:00:53] from all my diseases
[1:00:55] just gather some courage to stand with
[1:00:57] god's word
[1:00:58] in this hour you are not the one that
[1:01:02] fighting the battle he's the one that
[1:01:03] fights in the battle
[1:01:05] he's the one that fights our battle all
[1:01:07] we need to do is to just
[1:01:09] gather courage to stand on his word
[1:01:17] praise the lord just to gather some
[1:01:22] courage
[1:01:25] praise the lord even though courage has
[1:01:28] been
[1:01:29] in some way like many words has been
[1:01:31] misunderstood
[1:01:33] you know uh so also courage has been
[1:01:37] misunderstood sometimes people think
[1:01:39] you know uh i i you need to get courage
[1:01:42] to tell him your mind
[1:01:44] and express yourself to him and most of
[1:01:47] the time it's not in the right way
[1:01:50] praise the lord we gain courage we do
[1:01:52] certain things and then we feel bad
[1:01:54] about it
[1:01:56] that's not enough courage
[1:02:00] we need courage to bring ourselves on a
[1:02:02] suggestion
[1:02:03] courage i believe if cecira will have
[1:02:07] sense of fear in her
[1:02:10] he would have known that he can't trust
[1:02:11] this woman
[1:02:14] but she was not afraid
[1:02:19] for him to feel comfortable to take a
[1:02:22] nap in her house
[1:02:25] she was showing no sense of fear
[1:02:28] praise the lord because she was looking
[1:02:31] for an opportunity
[1:02:34] to take a stand
[1:02:40] blessed are there above women
[1:02:46] that was what the borough sunk
[1:02:49] blessed are down above women
[1:02:55] and so you see that all through the
[1:02:57] scripture right here
[1:03:00] you know where god
[1:03:03] puts that prophecy in place
[1:03:07] and anoint that woman
[1:03:10] because just in this hour
[1:03:13] where there is bunch of confusion
[1:03:16] amen a bunch of confusion we must be
[1:03:21] grateful we have a prophet message
[1:03:25] that we should stay faithful talk
[1:03:28] because if we didn't know how the
[1:03:29] prophet message would be do
[1:03:30] we'll be in the same mess that the rest
[1:03:32] of them are in
[1:03:35] even with the prophet message we save
[1:03:36] trying to to to get ourselves right
[1:03:40] because there are just a lot of thoughts
[1:03:41] flying all over the place
[1:03:45] a lot of time no prophet
[1:03:48] no prophet and the book of samia is
[1:03:52] described no open vision
[1:03:55] everybody did what was right in their in
[1:03:58] in their own lives
[1:04:01] but yet in that time god was still
[1:04:04] dealing with people god was using
[1:04:08] ordinary people this was just an
[1:04:11] ordinary
[1:04:12] housewife
[1:04:16] she was not a daughter of a priest
[1:04:20] her husband was not a minister this was
[1:04:22] just
[1:04:23] an ordinary housewife
[1:04:27] that was willing to take a stand
[1:04:33] praise the lord and i believe that's the
[1:04:36] hour we are living in people
[1:04:38] amen some people want to tie themselves
[1:04:41] to a lineage
[1:04:43] i'm from this place my father is this my
[1:04:45] mama is this
[1:04:46] we are from this tribe we're from this
[1:04:48] country our connection go back to
[1:04:50] jeffersonville
[1:04:51] we you know brother branham dean my
[1:04:53] father
[1:04:54] we want to turn ourselves to a lineage
[1:04:57] just to show
[1:04:58] that we fit in but god
[1:05:02] was using ordinary people
[1:05:06] ordinary people jeff thai was he was
[1:05:09] despised he was
[1:05:10] he was cut out
[1:05:14] because he was born out of holy well
[1:05:16] luck
[1:05:17] but yet he pleased god to make him a
[1:05:20] deliverer
[1:05:24] we are in the hour where god is using
[1:05:27] ordinary people
[1:05:32] to bring a revival to their home
[1:05:36] revival to their home
[1:05:40] revival
[1:05:44] using ordinary people in the most
[1:05:46] simplest way
[1:05:47] to do something for the lord
[1:05:51] even if nobody noticed them
[1:05:56] they stay in their closet and they
[1:05:58] prayed and said god
[1:06:00] bring us a revival lord give the young
[1:06:02] people the holy ghost
[1:06:12] praise the lord we can dedicate
[1:06:15] ourselves this easter
[1:06:19] that god will use us in the simplest
[1:06:22] things
[1:06:23] that we can bring to him in the humblest
[1:06:26] way
[1:06:29] that we can be able to serve him
[1:06:32] praise the lord there are a lot of other
