[5:17] okay and it says
[5:20] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[5:23] the Lord and He Delights if in his ways
[5:26] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[5:28] cast down for the Lord upholdeth him
[5:31] with his hands
[5:33] I have been young and now I'm old yet
[5:36] have I not seen the righteous forsaken
[5:38] nor his seed begging bread
[5:43] no it's just beautiful to know it's one
[5:45] thing to hold on to the Lord but it's
[5:47] another thing when he's holding on to
[5:49] you
[5:49] you know because we may let go but as he
[5:53] has said no one will ever take us from
[5:55] the palms of his hands amen

[6:36] Jesus Paid It All
[6:42] to him

[6:58] or now indeed I find
[7:04] high power and dine alone
[7:09] can't
[7:11] cleanse the leper spots
[7:22] Jesus Paid It All
[7:28] oh to hear my own
[7:34] sin and let the Crimson Stain
[7:39] he washed it white as snow
[7:45] oh
[7:47] nothing good ever
[7:52] whereby thy Grace to claim

[8:09] Jesus Paid It All
[8:15] to him
[8:17] [Music]
[8:19] oh
[8:20] sin and let the Crimson Stain
[8:26] he washed it white as snow
[8:32] and
[8:33] when Before the Throne
[8:37] I stand in and complete
[8:42] Jesus died my soul to say
[8:48] my lips shall still repeat
[8:55] Jesus Paid It All
[8:58] oh
[9:01] to hear my own
[9:05] sin had left the Crimson snake
[9:10] he washed it white as though Jesus Paid
[9:15] G
[9:17] Jesus Paid It All
[9:21] all
[9:23] to him

[41:34] I'm not uh

[41:47] um I'm beginning to be that kind

[41:54] little uh
[41:57] testimony video with you
[41:59] uh this was uh
[42:04] thank you musicians
[42:09] just before we get into
[42:12] the preaching of
[42:14] the word tonight
[42:19] this is February 8.
[42:22] this was the very same
[42:25] uh date that uh
[42:27] the congressman William offshore was
[42:30] healed
[42:31] so I decided to take a portion of of
[42:35] his testimony
[42:37] he's joining to Healing and to use that
[42:41] for the prayer meeting tonight
[42:43] so the the tech team there will
[42:48] play there for us and then right after
[42:50] that we will go into the service tonight
[43:40] Daniel if you cut the light off here
[43:43] place
[44:01] complexible name yeah
[44:13] full of any great distance was not worth
[44:15] the effort
[44:18] foreign
[44:26] 1900s was tough America was rural
[44:30] small farms dotted the landscape where
[44:33] many families struggled to put food on
[44:35] the table
[44:35] [Music]
[44:39] of any great distance was not worth the
[44:42] effort and medicine was nowhere near
[44:45] where it is today
[44:53] when William Upshaw was 18 years old he
[44:56] fell and broke his spine
[44:59] being an invalid is never an easy life
[45:02] but being an invalid at the turn of the
[45:04] century was one of the worst Fates
[45:06] anyone could imagine
[45:09] at just 18 years old William Upshaw had
[45:13] to come to terms with the fact that he
[45:14] may never walk again
[45:16] he spent the next seven years of his
[45:18] life in bed
[45:20] eventually by the grace of God he
[45:23] learned to walk again
[45:25] with the help of his little buddies a
[45:28] set of wooden crutches that were always
[45:29] by his side
[45:31] he still faced terrible challenges every
[45:34] day but the Inner Strength he built
[45:36] during the past seven years kept him
[45:38] moving forward
[45:40] William would become famous for his
[45:42] phrases let nothing discourage you never
[45:45] give up and God will heal me it just
[45:49] isn't time yet
[45:52] William Upshaw grew in faith and
[45:54] character over the years
[45:56] he wrote multiple books and eventually
[45:59] became a United States Congressman
[46:01] representing the state of Georgia
[46:03] his strong stance against the evils of
[46:05] alcohol became his Battle Cry he stood
[46:09] boldly for God
[46:10] and soon the Lord Jesus would come on
[46:14] the scene and completely deliver him of
[46:16] his injury
[46:18] [Music]
[46:19] on February 8 1951 brother Branham held
[46:24] a series of meetings at Calvary Temple
[46:26] in Los Angeles on the closing night of
[46:29] the meetings in a vision
[46:31] brother Branham saw a stack of hay
[46:33] materialized in front of him
[46:35] as he watched it he saw a young man fall
[46:38] and severely hurt himself
[46:40] as the vision began to reveal the man's
[46:43] life brother Branham realized that same
[46:46] man was sitting in the congregation
[46:48] it was Congressman Upshaw
[46:51] go tell the congressman that God has
[46:53] healed him brother Branham boldly
[46:55] proclaimed Congressman Upshaw believed
[46:58] and he immediately stood up he never
[47:02] used his little buddies again

[47:16] couldn't tell and I told Mr Baxter a few

[47:28] God began to fall and a woman had raised
[47:30] out of a wheelchair and some more things

[52:21] same soul lord God many years ago
[52:24] uh this testimony hang in the U.S
[52:28] Congress it hangs around the word of
[52:31] Father these were not things that were
[52:33] that took place in the shadow these were
[52:37] things that took place father Lord on

[52:43] and great men and their lord we want to
[52:46] thank you Father the Lord God we can

[53:21] praise the Lord
[53:22] and we would just I want to thank the
[53:26] Lord for giving us another opportunity
[53:28] to be in the house of the Lord tonight
[53:30] and uh that we can Fellowship around the
[53:34] word of God praise the Lord now I I was
[53:38] I was uh I was steady when I came across
[53:42] uh uh that and then a kind of a look at
[53:46] the date I said well okay it's it's a
[53:48] good timing we can be able to fit that
[53:50] into our calendar for this year praise
[53:52] the Lord and uh a few of few of that
[53:56] also we will We Will We would like to to
[53:59] look at as we as we go through the year
[54:03] now the reason did is that we have to
[54:06] remind ourselves
[54:07] you know we have to remind ourselves I
[54:10] was listening to bird brand preaching
[54:11] Town testing Memorial you look in the
[54:14] scripture you see that God uh love to
[54:18] remind his people he said that's what
[54:20] the Holy Ghost would do it will remind
[54:22] us it will bring back to our membrane so
[54:25] you see through the scripture how God
[54:27] told his people to uh you know to build
[54:31] to build monuments so they can be able
[54:34] to remind themselves look back God told
[54:36] them there uh
[54:39] after they came through the Jordan that
[54:42] he should build a memorial so tomorrow
[54:44] they can point to the memorial and and
[54:47] you know and remind their children tell
[54:49] their children that these you know these
[54:51] rocks came from that River we passed
[54:54] through the river and we took those
[54:55] rocks from there and we planted it here
[54:58] praise the Lord amen so God loved
[55:01] memoriam Allelujah
[55:04] now so uh uh we we
[55:07] ought to remind ourselves you know of of
[55:09] those things uh we are not believing
[55:12] cunning device people of men these are
[55:15] not stories that are just made up of men
[55:18] and uh and you will you will realize
[55:20] that if you studied the message you will
[55:23] find out that uh uh ah those days of the
[55:27] Revival there were I was I was listening
[55:30] out no I have a book that I was reading
[55:33] of of a man that followed the the
[55:37] healing Revival around the U.S he was he
[55:40] was kind of for a photojournalist and uh
[55:44] I think his background was either from
[55:48] from either the Baptists or Methodist
[55:50] Church and in those days there were
[55:54] there were healing tents you know tense
[55:56] Revival all around the country
[55:58] and uh and he said uh his uh
[56:02] you know his parents you know they would
[56:04] tell them that those peoples in those
[56:07] tense Revival they were calling Spirits
[56:09] you know so they'll never go down there
[56:12] you know those people they are they're
[56:14] always you know out there invoking
[56:16] spirits and all sorts of that so so out
[56:19] of fear he was creeping you know to go
[56:23] and see what was happening and that's
[56:25] how he got he got caught up in following
[56:28] the Revival meetings until he came to
[56:31] Warner Brother Brandon meeting
[56:33] and then he got stuck behind brother
[56:36] Branham services and uh
[56:40] and uh so uh those were things that were
[56:44] happening they were they were they were
[56:46] very common around the U.S around that
[56:48] time they were very common they were all
[56:50] over the place there were people that
[56:52] was driving from as far as Minneapolis
[56:55] to go over to Georgia or Alabama or down
[57:00] in the South or uh where where these
[57:03] meetings are happening praise the Lord
[57:05] now so uh uh uh I'm just I'm saying this
[57:09] to to just kind of fall wake up our
[57:12] spirit a little bit and remind ourselves
[57:15] that uh these uh living testimonies
[57:19] praise the Lord these are living
[57:21] testimonies and and with all of those uh
[57:25] movement especially with uh the
[57:28] Pentecostal movement the healing
[57:30] revivals and uh after the period of time
[57:34] you know uh when Whenever there is a
[57:37] movement that is pulling you know
[57:40] hundreds of people together
[57:43] uh uh the the the the the the U.S uh
[57:49] Security Agency become somehow uh
[57:52] sensitive they like to see what is
[57:54] happening you know in all of these
[57:56] Gathering that are happening around
[57:58] around the country so you will even see
[58:02] on tape where the uh
[58:06] there were times where there were some
[58:08] men that posted themselves as as FBI
[58:11] trying to read into brother Brandon
[58:13] meeting and there was sometimes where
[58:15] truthfully there were FBI that was
[58:17] reading into brother Brandon meeting so
[58:19] you see the uh this this the the the the
[58:22] message has been followed you know it
[58:25] has been watched
[58:27] praise the Lord it has been watched to
[58:30] see what uh uh you know what what what
[58:33] is really behind this we have to realize
[58:36] that uh it was it was right in this very
[58:39] sin Lane you know uh uh Joseph Smith
[58:42] rolls up with a bunch of followers you
[58:44] know Mamas and and a lot of the things
[58:47] that documents upon documents and
[58:50] reports and files that have been
[58:52] presented to uh to to the FBI of things
[58:56] that were done and different movements
[58:58] that have taken place around the country
[59:00] praise the Lord so you see uh uh I'm I'm
[59:05] saying all of this uh you know uh to uh
[59:09] for us to realize that uh uh you know uh
[59:13] we we have to be true to what we are
[59:16] called you know to believe
[59:19] amen we have to be true this yeah yes
[59:23] because this is not just you know
[59:25] playing church or joining church or or
[59:28] some kind of uh Movement we can be in
[59:31] for that setting x amount of years this
[59:34] is our life
[59:37] praise the Lord this is our life
[59:40] now so just like we read in uh in the in
[59:45] the scripture tonight we we would like
[59:47] to take uh uh a little uh talk from
[59:52] there and encourage us tonight uh you
[59:55] know I was I was thinking on that
[59:57] trying to make comparison you know uh
[1:00:03] so I went through a couple of different
[1:00:05] different videos and I saw that one from
[1:00:09] lifeline and I thought that okay this
[1:00:11] this is a good pull together so we can
[1:00:13] just use it before the prayer meeting
[1:00:16] time goes up the Bible says Elijah hey
[1:00:20] life was a man of like passion Just Like
[1:00:22] Us Praise the Lord now realize in the
[1:00:26] story that we have just read
[1:00:29] on the
[1:00:31] every Elijah Ministry
[1:00:34] when Elijah the tishback came there was
[1:00:38] a time of farming
[1:00:41] praise the Lord now uh second king
[1:00:44] chapter eight where we read this was
[1:00:47] Elijah
[1:00:50] the one that took over from Elijah
[1:00:53] praise the Lord so honor every Elijah
[1:00:57] Ministry there there are things that we
[1:01:01] can identify that took place uh on the
[1:01:05] on the uh that Ministry because we know
[1:01:08] that uh God spoke through his word and
[1:01:13] we know we are very familiar with faith
[1:01:15] how God used the spirit of Elijah
[1:01:18] five times four now and one is going to
[1:01:21] go back to Israel Revelation chapter 11.
[1:01:24] so uh uh we see that when Elijah the
[1:01:29] tishback came we don't have a lot of
[1:01:31] history from where he came from but we
[1:01:33] know he was a man of the wilderness
[1:01:36] praise the Lord
[1:01:38] and he came in such a time you know he
[1:01:41] came in such a time and uh uh uh era
[1:01:46] what you what we were talking about
[1:01:47] driving the last time about those stones
[1:01:49] I was I was looking at it it was it was
[1:01:52] a very very interesting thought it was
[1:01:55] very interesting because what came to my
[1:01:58] mind is that um
[1:02:02] uh uh
[1:02:04] talking about memoriam
[1:02:07] we were just we were looking at the book
[1:02:09] of uh
[1:02:11] uh Joshua and he was sharing with me the
[1:02:14] brother you know uh reminded him about
[1:02:17] the monument that was made after the
[1:02:20] crossing of the rare sea now Joshua
[1:02:24] asked him to make uh gather stones in
[1:02:28] the middle of Jordan and he also told
[1:02:31] them to gather Stones outside of Jordan
[1:02:35] so there were two monuments that were
[1:02:38] that were male that were put together
[1:02:41] now where it where it dropped my mind
[1:02:44] because when Elijah came on the scene
[1:02:47] the Bible make us to realize that he
[1:02:52] came to rebuild the altar of the Lord
[1:02:57] praise the Lord
[1:03:00] then they kind of forgot my mind because
[1:03:02] I was I was now thinking you know uh he
[1:03:06] never went over to the the Temple of
[1:03:08] Solomon to rebuild their altar he built
[1:03:11] the altar by taking 12 Stones
[1:03:14] and there was the same instruction that
[1:03:19] Joshua gave to the men that came through
[1:03:21] the Jordan that they should take a stone
[1:03:24] for each tribe to be able to build that
[1:03:27] Monument
[1:03:28] praise the Lord amen so in in the period
[1:03:33] of time from the time of Joshua all down
[1:03:36] to the time of the Kings
[1:03:38] you will realize that that alter
[1:03:44] has disappeared
[1:03:46] whether it was destroyed whether it was
[1:03:49] despised whatever it is you will find
[1:03:52] that that uh uh the the the ministry of
[1:03:57] Elijah now uh was uh building rebuilding
[1:04:01] the Altar and their altar now will
[1:04:04] restore the house of the people
[1:04:09] praise the Lord because there was Elijah
[1:04:13] Ministry to restore the house of the
[1:04:15] people so right there in the first king
[1:04:18] chapter 17 18 you will see Elijah is
[1:04:22] saying Lord let these people know that I
[1:04:25] have done everything according to your
[1:04:27] word and let this thing that I've done
[1:04:30] be what that will restore their heart
[1:04:33] back
[1:04:35] praise the Lord
[1:04:36] so he's doing everything according to
[1:04:39] the word because it will be the word
[1:04:41] that will restore the house of the
[1:04:43] people back
[1:04:46] praise the Lord amen so but then we
[1:04:50] realize that under that first Elijah
[1:04:53] Ministry there was a farming
[1:04:57] Elijah said there would be no rain
[1:05:00] neither do you until I call for it
[1:05:04] praise the Lord
[1:05:06] amen and we know that that took place
[1:05:09] exactly
[1:05:10] now we are seeing on the Elisha Ministry
[1:05:14] which of course here that we know that
[1:05:17] the spirit of of uh of Elijah Came Upon
[1:05:21] Elisha when he put his matter on him he
[1:05:24] took the ministry of Elijah now we see
[1:05:27] now in the on the his ministry also here
[1:05:30] is another time of farming
[1:05:33] seven years
[1:05:35] praise the Lord
[1:05:37] at seven years of farming
[1:05:40] now then uh uh
[1:05:46] Eli Elijah yeah now it is instructing
[1:05:50] this woman
[1:05:52] to uh
[1:05:55] you know go away take your household go
[1:05:58] to the land you know or the Philistine
[1:06:01] your entire house you know you go and
[1:06:04] take care of your family there just
[1:06:07] going to be farming in the land
[1:06:10] and now when she comes back to the Lane
[1:06:13] she realized that she has lost
[1:06:16] everything

[1:07:23] Lord she never did that she came back
[1:07:25] and Yara says she's trying to find her
[1:07:28] way to go to the king and trying to find
[1:07:32] a way to talk to the king that
[1:07:35] everything that she lost
[1:07:38] can be restored back to her
[1:07:42] praise the Lord

[1:08:13] can you please uh find a way that I can
[1:08:15] sit down with the King and all of that
[1:08:17] at the very time that she she got back
[1:08:20] there and uh the scripture this year
[1:08:23] making us to to realize that uh the King
[1:08:26] has sent for gehiza
[1:08:28] the seven of of the prophet
[1:08:32] to come and sit down with him and and
[1:08:34] and and come and tell me tell me some of
[1:08:37] the great things that God had done under

[1:08:48] some of the things that you have seen
[1:08:51] praise the Lord
[1:08:52] and he's talking about uh I mean uh I
[1:08:56] think he could even go back to talk
[1:08:58] about the Days of Elijah he could go
[1:09:01] back and talk about when the prophet
[1:09:03] asked that God shall open his eyes and
[1:09:06] and the angels that he saw on the
[1:09:09] mountain and he's talking all of those
[1:09:11] things you know and then sometimes when
[1:09:13] you hear those things they sound like
[1:09:15] feebos they can sound like make up
[1:09:18] stories
[1:09:20] praise the Lord
[1:09:22] amen they can sound like make up stories
[1:09:25] I was just uh driving to church tonight
[1:09:27] and I will also playing uh Rosella
[1:09:30] Griffin uh on a testimony she was
[1:09:32] testifying you know uh uh how she
[1:09:36] struggled on the uh uh uh
[1:09:39] being an addict you know alcohol until
[1:09:43] the grace of God came down and and
[1:09:45] someone took her to brother Brandon
[1:09:47] meeting and she came right there you

[1:09:54] that uh drinking Spirit off of her and
[1:09:57] she never put another alcohol on her leg
[1:10:00] for the rest of her life
[1:10:02] praise the Lord amen you yeah we you

[1:10:07] existence
[1:10:10] the raising of the the the little fish
[1:10:13] and you you hear about uh uh uh uh you
[1:10:17] know uh brother Brandon did in in her
[1:10:20] White House and giving giving her boys
[1:10:22] back to her the head around I give you
[1:10:24] your son and the Holy Spirit struck
[1:10:26] those two boys down there and they gave
[1:10:28] their heart to the Lord we hear all of
[1:10:30] these stories they looked like feeble
[1:10:33] and I believe that is the same condition
[1:10:35] where that King was sitting he was just
[1:10:37] not in his head yeah yeah
[1:10:40] oh wow
[1:10:42] oh really
[1:10:44] praise the Lord
[1:10:47] and right there here is a woman trying
[1:10:49] to squeeze her way in and and find her
[1:10:51] way over to the king and he says and one
[1:10:54] time you know what uh there was a lady
[1:10:57] in this set it out so nice to us and uh
[1:10:59] you know what uh uh uh and and her son
[1:11:03] died really
[1:11:06] praise the Lord
[1:11:09] and that man of God just went right down
[1:11:12] there you know while and and and and and
[1:11:14] he prayed for the boy
[1:11:16] and the boy came back to life really
[1:11:20] that damn boy raised back to life
[1:11:24] right at that time the woman broke
[1:11:26] through the crowd
[1:11:30] praise the Lord
[1:11:32] right at that time she broke through the
[1:11:34] crowd
[1:11:37] and get his I says here is the woman I'm
[1:11:39] telling you about and here is the boy
[1:11:42] now another woman but here is the boy
[1:11:47] that came back to life
[1:11:50] praise the Lord now you can think about
[1:11:52] it now you think about it in your mind
[1:11:54] this is not just a street person this
[1:11:58] was a man that was a congressman a man
[1:12:01] that reigned for president
[1:12:09] praise the Lord so wish me his his his
[1:12:12] name is noon every word
[1:12:16] he's a public servant
[1:12:20] praise the Lord
[1:12:24] and he was a Baptist above the preacher
[1:12:30] he was a Baptist preacher
[1:12:37] the only reason why they never vote him
[1:12:40] because he was very high on alcohol
[1:12:44] yeah he was very strong on on Whiskey
[1:12:49] praise the Lord
[1:12:51] so being about to preacher
[1:12:54] he and Roy Davis
[1:12:57] Rod Davis was brother Branham pastor
[1:13:01] because brother Branham came through the
[1:13:03] Baptist rank
[1:13:05] praise the Lord
[1:13:09] and now you have to remember now brother
[1:13:11] Bannon being a young preacher
[1:13:14] preaching on the Royal Davis and Yara
[1:13:16] said he's telling Rod Davis of the
[1:13:18] vision in all of these things and uh and
[1:13:21] and and and and the old man was not I
[1:13:24] mean he was just thinking this boy every
[1:13:26] time he's coming he's coming with some
[1:13:28] kind of a dream and every time he's
[1:13:30] coming in he says uh you know what uh uh
[1:13:33] uh some something spoke to him do not
[1:13:36] smoke do not drink do not defy your body
[1:13:39] you know uh uh uh he loved brother
[1:13:42] Brandon but uh uh uh realizing where he
[1:13:46] took uh uh uh William Branham from now
[1:13:49] being educated
[1:13:51] you know and and with the kind of a
[1:13:54] rough life that he had and you ever said
[1:13:56] here that he's telling him that an angel
[1:13:58] is telling him that he's going to pray
[1:14:00] for sick and great men and all of that
[1:14:02] you know and and and so and and he he
[1:14:06] was he was very uh uh
[1:14:09] uh you know he was trying to be careful
[1:14:12] not to discourage the Young The Young
[1:14:14] preacher but he also was not really
[1:14:17] believing because there was not there
[1:14:19] was not a lot of Divine Healing you know
[1:14:21] in uh in in among the Baptist people at
[1:14:24] around that time
[1:14:25] so uh and and we know the story
[1:14:29] brother Brandon would not have been
[1:14:30] ordained a woman preacher that's how he
[1:14:33] and Rod David went separate ways and uh
[1:14:37] uh uh but they kept their friendship you
[1:14:40] know brother Brandon respected him you
[1:14:42] know better Brandon would talk highly of
[1:14:44] Rod Davis you know he said Rod Davis was
[1:14:47] a lawyer by profession
[1:14:50] praise the Lord so the first night he
[1:14:53] would allowed brother Branham to preach
[1:14:56] Birdman came preaching you know as a
[1:14:59] young preacher and uh you know he's uh
[1:15:03] he's uh trying to encourage the people
[1:15:06] and you know he preacher Lazarus you
[1:15:10] know in uh
[1:15:12] uh
[1:15:14] uh and the beggar you know and then he's
[1:15:17] uh you know better brand going through
[1:15:19] the scripture
[1:15:21] and he's saying uh you know uh trying
[1:15:24] it's hard to put out his message you
[1:15:27] know and uh
[1:15:30] and he went down to Hell and he cried
[1:15:34] there was no mother there and he cried
[1:15:37] and if you don't give your life to Jesus
[1:15:39] you were crying
[1:15:42] you know and you know brother Brian
[1:15:43] doing his best and pouring out his heart
[1:15:47] he said after he got through preaching
[1:15:49] you know uh uh and and you know and
[1:15:53] people you know people God touching you
[1:15:57] know and it started crying and and all
[1:15:59] of that
[1:16:01] and people uh you know all uh Billy that
[1:16:04] was a good salmon you know and in north
[1:16:06] of Daddy and then he came he made his
[1:16:09] pastor
[1:16:10] and uh for us oh man that was one of the
[1:16:13] horrible message I've ever heard
[1:16:16] praise the Lord but bam said he just
[1:16:19] tear me into pieces
[1:16:21] he says he says he says he says Billy
[1:16:25] you know uh uh and then he was now
[1:16:28] speaking in the sense of a lawyer now he
[1:16:30] says that uh you know
[1:16:32] uh you uh you are you are standing there
[1:16:37] as as an attorney for the people as a
[1:16:40] mediator you know you have to you have
[1:16:43] to carry convincing statement you don't
[1:16:45] go play on people's sympathy
[1:16:48] you know don't play on people sympathy
[1:16:50] well you gotta you got to carry
[1:16:52] convincing statement you know praise the
[1:16:55] Lord and and I think that's a good one
[1:16:57] amen praise the Lord you got to be
[1:17:00] convenient you got to take it from the
[1:17:01] scripture don't come and tell people you
[1:17:03] know your mother used to be a good
[1:17:05] member of this church you know and uh
[1:17:07] and you know I mean don't you don't play
[1:17:09] it on people sympathy so he nailed
[1:17:10] brother random on that
[1:17:12] praise the Lord but when they are
[1:17:15] separate ways and you know when brother
[1:17:17] Brandon respected Roy Davis if you look
[1:17:19] through the message you will see how he
[1:17:21] hardly speak about that man now one
[1:17:24] wrong thing he said he will only tell
[1:17:25] your word the differ but he respected
[1:17:28] his Pastor now uh but then
[1:17:33] as time goes by there were a lot of
[1:17:35] testimonies of the different people that
[1:17:38] brother Brandon has prayed for until
[1:17:41] there was someone that was sick in
[1:17:43] brother Royal David's Church and he
[1:17:45] called brother Branham he said Bella
[1:17:47] will you come and pray and brother
[1:17:49] Brandon prayed and and yeah and and the
[1:17:51] man got healed so it was a witness
[1:17:54] before Rod Davis Eyes
[1:17:57] praise the Lord
[1:17:58] so when they went to the Baptist's uh
[1:18:01] convention that was where uh William
[1:18:05] Arthur met Rod Davis
[1:18:07] and then uh you know in Royal Davis told
[1:18:11] him about brother Brandon
[1:18:13] praise the Lord
[1:18:15] and encourage him to go to Warner
[1:18:18] Brother Brandon's meeting
[1:18:22] praise the Lord
[1:18:25] and he took her he took the offer and he
[1:18:28] choose to go to the meeting
[1:18:30] praise the Lord
[1:18:32] amen I have I have some other pictures
[1:18:34] there I never had time to to send them
[1:18:38] back there but I mean some of them were
[1:18:40] right in the in a short video that we
[1:18:42] watched tonight so they were just going
[1:18:44] to be repetition of pictures so uh I
[1:18:47] mean he went to the meeting and he I
[1:18:49] mean he saw what what the Lord was doing
[1:18:51] you know healing the people and all of
[1:18:54] that you know so uh uh uh I'm just I'm
[1:18:58] just I'm just trying to encourage our
[1:19:00] faith tonight you know uh and and let us
[1:19:04] know that uh I mean uh
[1:19:07] we uh we are following fulfilled
[1:19:11] scripture
[1:19:13] praise the Lord
[1:19:15] we now following the man
[1:19:17] We are following fulfilled scripture
[1:19:19] because God will always fulfill his word
[1:19:23] in you and me
[1:19:26] praise the Lord amen and if we and if we
[1:19:30] dedicate our life if we if we consecrate
[1:19:33] our life and your life can be a
[1:19:37] testimony to someone praise the Lord and
[1:19:40] the person gave their life to Christ the
[1:19:43] person is not following you
[1:19:45] they are following the word that was
[1:19:48] fulfilled in your life
[1:19:54] praise the Lord
[1:19:55] now following the word
[1:20:01] because it's only the word the spoken
[1:20:04] word of God
[1:20:06] will be able to bring forth of his kind
[1:20:10] praise the Lord
[1:20:12] anything that is not God's word I mean
[1:20:14] uh it will not be able to reproduce
[1:20:17] itself
[1:20:21] so that's what I wanted for us to see
[1:20:23] tonight
[1:20:28] this is one
[1:20:30] I mean and we can we can we can read
[1:20:32] testimony and and play testimony but I
[1:20:35] mean uh I I choose this one one because
[1:20:39] this uh this was this happened on the
[1:20:41] 8th of February but one of the the uh
[1:20:44] another reason is there because of the
[1:20:48] rank of the individual
[1:20:51] praise the Lord
[1:20:53] if it was fake
[1:20:56] it would be a big issue
[1:21:01] praise the Lord
[1:21:02] if he was a lying wonders
[1:21:05] it would be a big issue
[1:21:08] praise the Lord
[1:21:11] just like uh uh the pillow fire picture
[1:21:14] that brother uh Freddie referred to
[1:21:17] there on Sunday and uh it's it's just
[1:21:21] the same
[1:21:25] it was it was examined by the FBI
[1:21:29] and it hangs in there in uh Washington
[1:21:33] DC
[1:21:38] praise the Lord
[1:21:42] are we together
[1:21:47] so Elijah said this is a prayer media I
[1:21:49] won't keep you too long Elijah said that
[1:21:52] uh this is the woman
[1:21:55] and this is the boy
[1:21:57] that was raised from life I mean raised
[1:22:01] from the dead back to life sorry and uh
[1:22:04] and the scripture says
[1:22:09] right there the woman was able to put
[1:22:11] her supplication before the king
[1:22:13] and everything that she lost
[1:22:18] praise the Lord
[1:22:20] so you see another thing that is
[1:22:22] attached to the ministry of Elijah is
[1:22:25] restoration
[1:22:31] praise the Lord
[1:22:35] everything that she lost was restored
[1:22:42] she lost her son to death God restored
[1:22:45] him back
[1:22:46] she lost her house God restored it back
[1:22:50] she lost her land god restored it back
[1:23:00] praise the Lord
[1:23:05] before I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:23:07] before the Great and the Dreadful day of
[1:23:09] the Lord
[1:23:11] he would turn the house of the father to
[1:23:13] the children
[1:23:14] The House of the the children back to
[1:23:17] the father
[1:23:18] Lisa come and smash the Earth with her
[1:23:21] curse
[1:23:23] praise the Lord
[1:23:26] this is not calling device feeble this
[1:23:30] is not a thing that is just put together
[1:23:33] by men
[1:23:34] this is the hand of God
[1:23:40] praise the Lord
[1:23:41] this is the hand of God I will close
[1:23:43] with this
[1:23:46] Let's uh let's take our Bibles
[1:23:58] sent tonight is a prayer meeting night
[1:24:02] I don't remember the service on Saturday
[1:24:04] it would be a city that uh
[1:24:08] 637 with a brother
[1:24:14] Eric Peterson from South Africa do you
[1:24:17] fly in on Friday
[1:24:18] you pray for us Saturday night and
[1:24:21] Sunday morning
[1:24:22] so let's come and support the meetings
[1:24:25] and uh
[1:24:28] I'm sure you'll be blessed praise the
[1:24:30] Lord
[1:24:40] Exodus chapter 8.
[1:24:52] Exodus chapter 8.
[1:25:18] you know people
[1:25:21] have turned uh to social media
[1:25:25] to complain about what they don't like
[1:25:27] about the message and what they don't
[1:25:29] like it I mean you should be able to
[1:25:33] uh
[1:25:34] like like I told someone I say Sir if uh
[1:25:38] William Brandon was wrong in his
[1:25:40] teaching I believe that that God
[1:25:43] maybe might have just honored him
[1:25:45] because he was he was Earnest and
[1:25:48] dedicated to what he believed
[1:25:51] yeah
[1:25:52] praise the Lord
[1:25:54] amen
[1:25:56] but the thing there is that we have to
[1:25:58] ask ourselves what have we done for the
[1:26:01] Lord
[1:26:04] praise the Lord
[1:26:06] if a boy with a seventh grade education
[1:26:09] and a poor background that he came from
[1:26:13] who influence the word
[1:26:18] who influenced the word
[1:26:22] what have we done
[1:26:24] just just forget about the whole word
[1:26:27] you don't have to do anything for the
[1:26:28] whole word
[1:26:29] what have you done for your siblings
[1:26:33] your neighbors your friends
[1:26:36] what influence have you done
[1:26:42] praise the Lord
[1:26:44] so why why go what waste your energy
[1:26:49] to fight against someone
[1:26:55] that only try to help people to live
[1:26:58] right
[1:27:02] praise the Lord
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:06] una tried to help people to live right
[1:27:09] to do what is right
[1:27:16] oh he were high on women
[1:27:20] praise the Lord
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:23] and uh we we started something uh Sunday
[1:27:26] night I'm coming back today I'm coming
[1:27:28] back to that whole design thing I've
[1:27:31] been working on it praise the Lord
[1:27:34] amen
[1:27:37] and I and I and I think uh uh
[1:27:41] uh
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:46] uh you know so I mean just like I'm
[1:27:47] saying this is just to encourage you
[1:27:49] tonight
[1:27:50] praise the Lord
[1:27:51] is to encourage you you have to yeah I
[1:27:55] mean just just don't don't follow the
[1:27:57] message
[1:27:59] don't just follow
[1:28:01] you got to believe it
[1:28:03] this thing is giving to be our life
[1:28:07] it's not giving to follow
[1:28:13] exhaust your doubt
[1:28:15] when the when the Queen of Sheba came to
[1:28:19] meet Solomon
[1:28:20] praise the Lord everything that she
[1:28:23] heard
[1:28:25] that Solomon could do the doubts that
[1:28:28] she had

[1:28:33] asked her question

[1:29:13] Doubt is here he will dissolve all your
[1:29:17] doubts he will take away your fear
[1:29:20] there's nothing to be afraid of
[1:29:30] are we together
[1:29:33] okay I'm left with several meetings
[1:29:36] I can do it Exodus chapter 8.
[1:29:43] Exodus chapter eight let's look at verse
[1:29:46] 19.
[1:29:49] that's what my note said
[1:29:55] now this is pharaoh and and uh and and
[1:29:58] uh you know in in uh and his magician
[1:30:01] Moses before Pharaoh here the Bible says
[1:30:05] then the magician said unto Pharaoh this
[1:30:08] is the Finger of God
[1:30:12] praise the Lord
[1:30:14] what they were seeing
[1:30:16] amen when Moses came he threw his rod
[1:30:19] down they throw their own down you know
[1:30:22] uh uh you know I mean he threw his raw
[1:30:27] down they tend to to snake they could
[1:30:30] throw they asked their home that's cheap
[1:30:31] magician
[1:30:34] cheap Magic
[1:30:36] praise the Lord
[1:30:38] Hallelujah
[1:30:39] but yet his cheap magic ate their own
[1:30:44] praise the Lord
[1:30:46] and then after the next one the the you
[1:30:49] know when uh when when the frogs and and
[1:30:52] the fleas and all of that started coming
[1:30:53] this is their own testimony telling
[1:30:56] Pharaoh this is the finger
[1:31:00] of God
[1:31:03] praise the Lord
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:08] Exodus chapter 31.
[1:31:16] I'm uh kind of full
[1:31:20] Y into
[1:31:23] a message I wanted to preach
[1:31:25] called The Finger of God so I'm I'm kind
[1:31:29] of for the exhausting my
[1:31:31] my notes
[1:31:33] but that's fine
[1:31:35] praise the Lord
[1:31:38] let's look at Verse 18 the last verse
[1:31:40] there Exodus 1 verse 18.
[1:31:43] and he gave unto Moses
[1:31:48] when he had made an end of communion
[1:31:51] with him upon Mount Santa table of
[1:31:55] testimony tables of sun written wave the
[1:32:00] Finger of God
[1:32:04] praise the Lord
[1:32:06] the same finger that wrote The
[1:32:08] Commandments were the same finger that
[1:32:12] did that brought the Plex on Egypt
[1:32:17] are we together
[1:32:19] Luke chapter 11.
[1:32:27] the same finger that wrote The
[1:32:29] Commandments was the same finger that
[1:32:32] wrote on the wall of Babylon
[1:32:37] before battery charger
[1:32:42] the same finger that wrote The
[1:32:45] Commandments was the same finger that
[1:32:49] was writing on the same
[1:32:54] praise the Lord
[1:32:56] when those Pharisees caught that woman
[1:32:58] in adultery
[1:33:00] they met the same finger writing in the
[1:33:03] scene
[1:33:06] Luke chapter 11.
[1:33:08] we're close with this
[1:33:26] are we together
[1:33:29] to you
[1:33:37] now here look uh he
[1:33:42] he recorded a testimony here
[1:33:45] of
[1:33:48] were these uh you know
[1:33:54] Pharisees talking to Jesus and calling
[1:33:58] him decibel
[1:34:00] and Jesus will say to them
[1:34:04] uh I said Luke 11 as that is in uh okay
[1:34:08] sorry I see why
[1:34:10] I'm I'm reading the same story from
[1:34:12] Matthew so I'm kind of looking the wrong
[1:34:15] place
[1:34:17] Matthew chapter 12.
[1:34:20] is where that came from but let's look
[1:34:22] in Luke it's Luke 11 that I want to
[1:34:25] I want to look at
[1:34:29] Luke 11.
[1:34:31] let me find my verse and make sure that
[1:34:33] uh
[1:34:35] Jesus said in verse 19 but if I by
[1:34:39] basketball cast out devil
[1:34:41] by whom do your sons cast them out
[1:34:45] therefore Shah they be your judge
[1:34:50] but if I with the Finger of God
[1:34:55] cast out devil no doubt the kingdom of
[1:34:59] God
[1:35:00] is calm
[1:35:04] praise the Lord
[1:35:06] amen
[1:35:07] so the same
[1:35:10] finger
[1:35:11] that brought the plagues
[1:35:14] the magician identified what was
[1:35:16] happening in Egypt as the Finger of God
[1:35:19] we can fight against this this is the
[1:35:22] Finger of God
[1:35:24] praise the Lord
[1:35:26] Moses testified to us that the the
[1:35:30] tablets The Ten Commandments were
[1:35:32] written by the Finger of God
[1:35:35] praise the Lord
[1:35:37] Jesus is testifying here in this gospel
[1:35:40] that he cast out Spirit by the Finger of
[1:35:45] God
[1:35:47] praise the Lord
[1:35:49] amen
[1:35:51] you know when brother bam talks about
[1:35:52] that he says uh he says uh and and
[1:35:56] that's how he rescued us
[1:35:58] you know when he pick you up from sin he
[1:36:01] pick you up by the Finger of God
[1:36:05] praise the Lord I got sure I can
[1:36:07] remember he just grabbed me by the ear
[1:36:09] just like this
[1:36:10] the Finger of God grabbed me by the ear
[1:36:13] and just pulled me out I don't know how
[1:36:16] he grabbed you but that was how he got
[1:36:18] me
[1:36:19] praise the Lord
[1:36:21] now this is just like I said this is
[1:36:23] just to encourage us
[1:36:25] the same word
[1:36:27] that spoke this word into existence
[1:36:31] that's the same word we are
[1:36:32] fellowshipping around
[1:36:35] the same word that that designed the
[1:36:38] universe
[1:36:39] the word of God that designed the
[1:36:41] universe
[1:36:45] praise the Lord
[1:36:47] don't underestimate the word of God
[1:36:51] there is nothing that we are dealing
[1:36:53] with no situation in our life
[1:36:58] that is greater than this word
[1:37:02] this word
[1:37:04] has the changing power
[1:37:06] to change our life
[1:37:09] and for the mother of Father the prophet
[1:37:10] of God said is changing the atoms of our
[1:37:13] body
[1:37:16] is changing the atoms of our body so
[1:37:19] this word is in our bloodstream
[1:37:27] it's in our bloodstream
[1:37:31] it can it can heal our sickness
[1:37:35] it can break our habits
[1:37:40] it can deliver us
[1:37:44] they can change our life
[1:37:47] praise the Lord
[1:37:50] if you please God to heal a man after 66
[1:37:55] years
[1:38:01] after 66 years
[1:38:06] broke his back when he was 18 years
[1:38:09] got healed when he was 84 years
[1:38:17] that's him God Can Heal Your Life
[1:38:21] they are saying God can deliver you
[1:38:23] that same God can change your situation
[1:38:28] praise the Lord
[1:38:31] William offshore said I know I will be
[1:38:33] healed it's just a matter of time and
[1:38:36] you can say the same thing to all I know
[1:38:38] I will be changed it's just a matter of
[1:38:40] time

[1:57:30] oh he wrote it in the sea

[1:57:37] oh now I have a peace that he has given
[1:57:43] me
[1:57:45] all my Saints and burden
[1:57:49] he wrote it in one more time now oh
[1:57:53] Jesus took my birthday and he wrote it
[1:57:57] in the sea oh he rolled them in the sea

[1:58:10] that he has given me
