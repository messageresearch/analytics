[48:02] that and and address that you know I
[48:06] always have some plans. Amen.
[48:10] I always have some plans. So, but uh we
[48:13] won't take all of the service to do that
[48:16] this
[48:17] morning. Uh since we have a visitor, we
[48:20] want to just uh um talk about that as
[48:23] home folks whenever we are with ourself.
[48:26] But uh before we change the order of the
[48:28] service, I will have brother Steven
[48:31] comes up. I just sneak him out there
[48:34] just now and whisper something in his
[48:35] ear. So,

[48:58] don't know me. I come to church here for
[48:59] a good little while. And uh I don't know
[49:03] what to say, but the Lord's really been
[49:05] good to me. Amen. Uh he's my everything.
[49:08] Amen. Uh just thank God for the revealed
[49:11] word of God for our day and hour. That's
[49:14] where our paths are crossed. Yeah. If it
[49:17] hadn't been for that messenger to come,
[49:19] where would we be? Right. So, uh I just
[49:22] want to thank you that I can come and
[49:25] stand before you. I tell you I love you.
[49:26] I believe you're God's children. You
[49:29] know, we all want to believe we're one
[49:30] of his.
[49:32] you know, uh he knows his very own and
[49:37] uh we feed on the infallible word of God
[49:41] and uh uh just it's just a good
[49:45] opportunity that we can just stand
[49:47] before you and and tell you that we love
[49:50] you. We draw strength from one another.
[49:53] We draw strength from the word of God.
[49:55] We come here to honor his resurrection.
[49:58] Amen. and to feed on that body work.
[50:01] Amen. You know, and uh one day this will
[50:06] all be over. We we won't we all want to
[50:10] make it. Our prophet told us, don't miss
[50:12] it for nothing. We're going to do all we
[50:15] can do to make it. The devil's going to
[50:17] do all he can do to try to stop us from
[50:20] making. But the victory's already won.
[50:23] You know, we love him. We just
[50:26] appreciate him. Now, Brother Juan's got
[50:28] to show up here cuz I'm not a speaker.
[50:31] Brother Juan, I appreciate this
[50:33] opportunity. I just want to tell you I
[50:35] love you and I appreciate this young man
[50:37] right here. I've got to hear him preach
[50:39] a couple times. And uh you you've really
[50:42] astounding me with your ministry,
[50:43] brother.
[50:45] And the first time I heard him preach, I
[50:47] wasn't here to hear him, but I said,
[50:49] "Brother Juan," I said, "Is that first
[50:51] time that brother spoke?" He said no, he
[50:53] uh he's been speaking
[50:55] some family gatherings or home
[50:58] gatherings or something another. But
[51:00] brother Ariel, we appreciate you,
[51:01] brother. So just thank you again for the
[51:04] opportunity. Now we we we we come here
[51:07] for best part of two years, couple years
[51:10] maybe. And when we left here, I didn't
[51:13] know we was leaving as quickly as we
[51:15] did. And so my daughter, my wife is with
[51:18] us. uh she's
[51:20] uh taken uh moving her workplace from
[51:25] here in Wisconsin to uh Panama
[51:31] City in
[51:32] Florida. Uh that location down there and
[51:36] she's got her home down there at
[51:39] Southport. It's just a short ways, 20
[51:42] minutes. So, uh that's where we've been
[51:44] back and forth and we've been back here
[51:45] for about a week. We come Monday night
[51:49] late and so
[51:51] uh Lord allowed us come to honor the
[51:54] resurrection with you people and uh
[51:57] you're just a lovely group and
[52:00] appreciate every one of you. So I got to
[52:03] shut up. God bless you.
[52:06] God bless you.
[52:15] Well,
[52:16] the praise the Lord, you know, it's one
[52:20] of those things where you say it without
[52:22] saying it, you know. So, uh uh in short,
[52:27] brother uh Stephen and his family based
[52:31] on the work of his daughter, they will
[52:33] be moving over to Florida, Panama,
[52:36] Florida. So, I thought since he was in
[52:38] service, he would be the good person to
[52:40] say it.
[52:41] And uh so that was that was just what
[52:44] all was about. So we want to keep them
[52:46] in our prayer. Sister Amy have to finish
[52:49] some uh uh things that she's doing there
[52:52] at her job before they finally move. So
[52:55] uh but they are in the moving process.
[52:57] So that's that was just all about that.
[52:59] Praise the Lord. So we just want to keep
[53:01] them in our prayers. Amen. Amen. Now, so
[53:04] we will we will not sing a song yet and
[53:06] then uh we will we will uh have our our
[53:11] dear brother to come and bring us this
[53:13] word. He knew me. He loved me. When he
[53:17] was on the cross, I was on his

[57:15] that. Sing the chorus and then we will
[57:17] turn the service over to our brother.
[57:19] I'm just a pagan and a
[57:26] stranger and a
[57:29] stranger. I'm wandering through this
[57:32] world of
[57:34] s. I'm on my way to God's
[57:40] destiny. Oh, when the saints go

[59:27] You may be sitting just for a
[59:50] while. I thank the Lord Jesus.
[59:58] for the grace they has given us to be
[1:00:00] together in this place.
[1:00:04] For me, I call the grace of
[1:00:08] God and I want to thank the pastor
[1:00:14] brother who has give me his place this
[1:00:17] morning.
[1:00:20] Fellowship. Yeah. To fellowship.
[1:00:24] and to fellowship with you all
[1:00:29] and I appreciate him a lot
[1:00:33] because he has been a pastor to my
[1:00:38] children and I've had uh my children
[1:00:40] have come to this
[1:00:45] church and maybe this morning there's
[1:00:47] only maybe two and there's only one that
[1:00:50] is
[1:00:52] And one is
[1:00:57] working in Arizona.
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:19] and Jonathan her sister.
[1:01:25] He has been a pastor to them.
[1:01:31] and certainly appreciate him for
[1:01:37] that and to take care of the girls and
[1:01:39] also the
[1:01:43] boy. It's not easy job but God bless
[1:01:46] Richard
[1:01:47] Bessim and I also want to thank you all
[1:01:56] and also for the love that you have uh
[1:01:58] shared or you have given to my
[1:02:01] children and I felt that they were very
[1:02:04] comfortable among you
[1:02:07] and I'm really happy for that. May God
[1:02:10] richly bless you. Amen.
[1:02:13] God bless you.
[1:02:24] uh if and if biologically I don't have a
[1:02:26] family here
[1:02:30] and I but I know that I have a ham
[1:02:32] family
[1:02:34] and the Brandham family
[1:02:37] it's all of you
[1:02:41] and I feel very comfortable amongst you
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:47] and thank you so much for the love that
[1:02:49] you have shared toward
[1:02:54] us and I've seen the pastor driving two
[1:02:56] hours to come and at the graduation of
[1:02:58] my daughter
[1:03:00] and it really touched me.
[1:03:03] May God richly bless
[1:03:05] him. May God rich bless him. May God
[1:03:09] bless you too.
[1:03:15] And this is the second time that the
[1:03:16] pastor has allowed me to speak.
[1:03:19] And I'm not a pastor.
[1:03:22] I'm brother Freddy.
[1:03:26] and my pastor's call by the Freddy
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:32] Massudi and we are at the southeast
[1:03:35] south east of the Congo
[1:03:38] and precisely in
[1:03:41] Lubashi Shai and the church is called
[1:03:43] Elai Tabernaci
[1:03:47] and my pastor is brother Freddy
[1:03:53] Massudi and probably one of these days
[1:03:55] you'll have the chance to meet him
[1:03:59] and if we don't it happen that we don't
[1:04:00] meet here on earth
[1:04:04] but we will meet one of these day up
[1:04:05] there
[1:04:11] and I'm also not a great preacher
[1:04:18] and just a little bit of noise here and
[1:04:23] there and I know that the pastor is the
[1:04:26] great teacher
[1:04:31] And I think you are also well taught.
[1:04:37] And I was talking to Mariss, the younger
[1:04:39] the youngest sister of Mary
[1:04:43] Paul. She was just telling me
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:51] something. Says, "When I was in high
[1:04:53] school in in the Congo,
[1:05:01] He says, "My faith when I was yet in the
[1:05:03] Congo in high school versus the faith
[1:05:05] that I have here with in this church
[1:05:07] with brother
[1:05:09] W." And I feel like I just went a little
[1:05:11] bit higher.
[1:05:14] It's not the same release,
[1:05:19] but today I have a more higher
[1:05:21] experience
[1:05:23] and definitely I can testify of it.
[1:05:27] They are my
[1:05:31] children. And I've noticed that just by
[1:05:34] them being among you and among the
[1:05:39] pastor and I've noticed that they've
[1:05:41] come even more to become more spiritual
[1:05:43] than they used to be used they used to
[1:05:48] be. And I appreciate the atmosphere that
[1:05:50] you guys have created around
[1:05:57] them. He has drawn them closer to God
[1:06:00] more than they were they used to be.
[1:06:04] May God be glorified for that. Amen.
[1:06:13] The last time I was here two years ago
[1:06:15] in
[1:06:16] 2023 and the weather really struck me
[1:06:20] bad. I didn't really appreciate the
[1:06:22] winter,
[1:06:25] but now I feel a little
[1:06:27] better and the weather's well and we are
[1:06:30] coming from a tropical hot climate
[1:06:34] and now I feel a little comfortable
[1:06:38] and now I can't stand the cold in
[1:06:42] here this morning.
[1:06:47] I would like to share some few things in
[1:06:49] the word of God.
[1:06:54] There are things that you already know.
[1:07:04] And when the pastor called
[1:07:07] me and I was trying to find something to
[1:07:10] read and to say,
[1:07:23] The Lord pushed me to say something
[1:07:26] here. We shall stand. We shall stand,
[1:07:41] please. this morning
[1:07:47] and we'll pray.
[1:07:50] Lord our
[1:07:53] father, we are coming before you humbly
[1:07:56] this
[1:07:58] morning. We want to read your word
[1:08:04] now. We want to invite you the
[1:08:08] word. You who have spoken through the
[1:08:11] mouth of a
[1:08:13] prophet that you come. You know the
[1:08:15] desire of our
[1:08:17] heart of every single one of
[1:08:20] us. You know every
[1:08:23] problem. You know my problem as
[1:08:26] well. We asking may you come with us.
[1:08:31] May you speak to us through your
[1:08:33] word because you have
[1:08:36] said when two or three will be gathered
[1:08:38] in my name I will be among
[1:08:42] you and we are here more than
[1:08:45] three. We want you to speak to
[1:08:48] us. May you take me as a person away
[1:08:51] side. May you speak to
[1:08:55] us just like a microphone that you can
[1:08:57] use this
[1:08:59] morning. You the God of really random.
[1:09:02] You're the God of brother one. The God
[1:09:05] of this church, the Lord Jesus
[1:09:09] Christ. We want you to
[1:09:11] descend. May you fellowship with us.
[1:09:16] May you give us something in your word
[1:09:18] that will console us so that when we
[1:09:21] will leave this
[1:09:23] place we might be like the disciple on
[1:09:25] the way to
[1:09:27] Emas. Did our heart burn within us as he
[1:09:29] was speaking to us? Give us something
[1:09:32] Lord through your
[1:09:34] word. Take the control of this
[1:09:37] place. Forgive our
[1:09:39] fault. Forgive our iniquities.
[1:09:42] Forgive our sins.
[1:09:45] Let your spirit be among us
[1:09:48] until the end of this service in the
[1:09:51] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:09:53] Amen.
[1:09:58] I like to always like to preach with my
[1:10:00] my Bible
[1:10:02] uh with paper but I have not brought
[1:10:06] it and I just realized that I brought it
[1:10:09] last time.
[1:10:13] I'm going to read something here
[1:10:16] in the book of Esther
[1:10:23] uh chapter
[1:10:29] nine from the first verse to the fifth
[1:10:36] verse and I'll probably read a lot in
[1:10:38] the Bible today.
[1:10:47] Now in the 12th month, that is the month
[1:10:50] of Adar, on the third the 30th day of
[1:10:54] the same, when the king commandment and
[1:10:56] his decree drew near to put to be put in
[1:10:59] execution. In the day that the enemy of
[1:11:02] the Jews hoped to have power over them,
[1:11:05] though he was turned to the contrary,
[1:11:08] and the Jew had ruled over them that
[1:11:12] hated them, the Jew gathered themselves
[1:11:14] together in the city throughout all the
[1:11:16] provinces of the king as Assyus to lay
[1:11:20] hands on such as sought their hurt. and
[1:11:24] no man could withstand them, for the
[1:11:27] fear of them fell upon all the people.
[1:11:31] And all the rulers of the provinces and
[1:11:33] the uh lutinate and the deputies and
[1:11:36] officer of the king helped the Jews
[1:11:39] because the fear of Morai fell upon
[1:11:41] them. For Modi was great in the king's
[1:11:44] house, and the fame went out throughout
[1:11:47] all the provinces. For these men Modi
[1:11:50] wax greater and greater. Thus the Jews
[1:11:54] smokeote all the en their enemies with
[1:11:57] the stroke of the sword and slaughter
[1:11:59] and destruction and did what they would
[1:12:02] unto they would unto those that hated
[1:12:06] them. May God bless the reading of the
[1:12:08] word. You may be seated.
[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:18] We are seeing that we are in a time
[1:12:20] where many promises are being fulfilled.
[1:12:27] Now we notice that there's a new pope
[1:12:29] that is coming that is originally from
[1:12:31] the United
[1:12:34] States. It's everybody that are speaking
[1:12:36] or talking about it.
[1:12:41] And back there in the Congo, there was a
[1:12:43] a Catholic
[1:12:45] priest that has taken that prophecy.
[1:12:50] And I have a lot of prophecy that
[1:12:52] brother Benham gave.
[1:12:56] Where is the pope that is coming from
[1:12:58] the United States?
[1:13:02] But now when the pope was actually
[1:13:04] voted,
[1:13:09] the brothers from the message
[1:13:15] They said, "Okay, here's here's the
[1:13:16] prophecy that has been fulfilled after
[1:13:18] almost 50 years."
[1:13:23] He he couldn't even argue
[1:13:25] anymore. Hallelujah.
[1:13:28] And it's to let you know that God
[1:13:29] remains Godl.
[1:13:34] All the prophecy that was given by
[1:13:36] brother
[1:13:38] Bannam and we are seeing that it is
[1:13:41] being fulfilled.
[1:13:43] This is the time in which we're living
[1:13:44] in
[1:13:47] and all this prophecy will be
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:53] fulfilled. It is also the time that the
[1:13:55] bride of Jesus Christ has to reach
[1:13:57] maturity.
[1:14:00] We are reaching maturity through the
[1:14:02] word of God or by the word of God.
[1:14:07] And I've seen And I've seen that this is
[1:14:09] a farmer
[1:14:12] land says one uh when uh uh corn
[1:14:18] grows at a certain
[1:14:23] level and he has to be exposed to the
[1:14:26] sun to
[1:14:29] grow. To grow. Yeah. To grow. Okay.
[1:14:34] It has to be exposed to the sun to
[1:14:38] grow. And this is exactly the time that
[1:14:40] we are living
[1:14:42] in. Now the bride has to be exposed to
[1:14:44] the sun
[1:14:46] and the son is
[1:14:48] Christ. It is the word of
[1:14:51] God. We have to be exposed or in front
[1:14:54] of the
[1:14:55] word. And now when the pastor is
[1:14:57] preaching, when you read the Bible, when
[1:15:01] you read the message, when you listen to
[1:15:03] the
[1:15:06] message, it brings Christ in your heart,
[1:15:09] people's
[1:15:11] heart, it brings them in in a personal
[1:15:14] contact with Jesus
[1:15:15] Christ. That's why people are
[1:15:18] growing. As brother Benham speaks of the
[1:15:20] statue of a perfect
[1:15:22] man, he says from faith to virtue
[1:15:28] and growing growing until they reach
[1:15:29] this the the peak.
[1:15:31] And this is the time in which we're
[1:15:32] living in.
[1:15:35] And my message this
[1:15:38] morning, it's just a little message
[1:15:41] about faith
[1:15:44] just to encourage the the people
[1:15:51] And sometime I wonder said somebody want
[1:15:53] to hear something
[1:15:56] good. You cannot always you know talk
[1:15:59] bad to to your your wife or your your
[1:16:03] wife at a certain
[1:16:05] level and at a certain time you need to
[1:16:07] say you have done a wonderful job. your
[1:16:09] you cooked
[1:16:11] well and you have also to tell her that
[1:16:14] you love
[1:16:16] her and that just give her encouragement
[1:16:19] and just she feel
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:23] assured the message is not just to blame
[1:16:26] people
[1:16:28] no just also to encourage us and after
[1:16:32] all
[1:16:34] and God knows what in what way we are
[1:16:37] formed
[1:16:38] and how we are
[1:16:40] created. He knows that we have mistakes,
[1:16:43] failures. He also
[1:16:45] knows he has to give us word of
[1:16:48] encouragement to give us
[1:16:55] strength and words that will encourage
[1:16:58] us to fight. Amen.
[1:17:03] And I would like to take a little small
[1:17:05] subject.
[1:17:07] in the first verse there in Esther
[1:17:10] chapter uh chapter nine. Now in the 12th
[1:17:14] month, that is the month of
[1:17:17] Adar, the 13th day of the
[1:17:22] same, when the king commandment and
[1:17:25] decree drew near to be put in
[1:17:31] execution. In the day that the enemies
[1:17:34] of the Jew hoped to have power over
[1:17:36] them,
[1:17:39] though it was turned to the contrary,
[1:17:46] that the Jews had rule over them that
[1:17:49] headed
[1:17:51] them. If I can talk about something to
[1:17:54] this
[1:17:55] morning is the contrary that
[1:17:59] happened. It's the contrary that
[1:18:01] happened in our life. Amen.
[1:18:05] The contrary.
[1:18:08] Now if you look in the book of Esther,
[1:18:16] It's a book that shows
[1:18:19] clearly that that there was a
[1:18:23] king that was Asseris the
[1:18:27] king and he had a queen called Vashi.
[1:18:32] Now you can go back in in Esther chapter
[1:18:36] one and I want to just go back a little
[1:18:41] bit and to remind you about the story.
[1:18:43] You can go back and read
[1:18:46] it. There was a
[1:18:49] king and that had a kingdom called Seuss
[1:18:53] in the capital
[1:18:57] city and the king had a a queen that was
[1:19:00] called Vash.
[1:19:02] And as we are
[1:19:05] going, you would notice that there's a
[1:19:08] man also called Mori.
[1:19:14] Now the book is describing that the king
[1:19:17] represent the king is a type of of
[1:19:21] God and the queen is a type of the
[1:19:24] bride.
[1:19:25] Now if you
[1:19:29] read now you would notice that Malachi
[1:19:32] Mori is the type
[1:19:33] of is a type of William
[1:19:37] Brandham we we are the believers of
[1:19:40] Malachi
[1:19:44] 4 and you will notice that in the type
[1:19:47] that we will be talking about for a few
[1:19:49] minutes I don't think that will be long
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] He he was very
[1:19:59] rich. Now he he he put together like a a
[1:20:02] a feast
[1:20:04] song. Now in the first
[1:20:07] verse, now if you
[1:20:13] notice, now he had a feast unto all the
[1:20:15] provinces and and his servants.
[1:20:19] The Bible
[1:20:21] says verse eight,
[1:20:25] and the drink was according to the law,
[1:20:27] and none did
[1:20:34] compel. For so the king had appointed
[1:20:36] all the officers in his house, and
[1:20:38] should should do according to every
[1:20:40] man's
[1:20:41] pleasure. Now when he was pleased and
[1:20:44] was happy,
[1:20:48] He had called his wife to show everybody
[1:20:51] to his all
[1:20:54] his. Now notice verse
[1:21:02] n also Vasha the queen had a feast for
[1:21:05] the women in the the royal house which
[1:21:07] belonged to the king
[1:21:10] Aseris. Notice something in verse
[1:21:13] 10. On the seventh day
[1:21:18] when the heart of the king was made with
[1:21:21] wine
[1:21:23] says and brother Benham says the wine is
[1:21:26] the stimulation of revelation
[1:21:30] now when brother brother one preach the
[1:21:33] revelation he he's
[1:21:36] excited and the church is also
[1:21:39] excited he says now the wine has you
[1:21:42] know taken the king he
[1:21:46] said, "I would like to call Vata the
[1:21:50] queen and to to present her to all my my
[1:21:54] those that were
[1:21:55] invited." Now in verse
[1:21:57] 10, on the seventh
[1:22:01] day, when the the heart of the king was
[1:22:03] Mary wine,
[1:22:05] he ordained or commanded
[1:22:09] me
[1:22:21] whatever
[1:22:23] harmonas zet
[1:22:26] card
[1:22:30] cast the seven chamlain that served in
[1:22:33] the presence of Asser the king. Now if
[1:22:35] you notice here the Bible says
[1:22:40] the seventh day.
[1:22:43] We are at the seven church ages.
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:50] Notice something here.
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:55] He also commanded seven chamlin. Yeah.
[1:23:00] Now if you know this, you could count
[1:23:03] with me.
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:13] Abaka, zetar, zetar, and carcass. Seven.
[1:23:20] There were seven of them
[1:23:25] and the seven church ages
[1:23:28] with seven messengers.
[1:23:33] The Bible says in the book of
[1:23:36] Revelation in first chapter
[1:23:42] in the right hand of the one that was
[1:23:44] standing in the midst of the ch uh uh
[1:23:45] the
[1:23:47] candlesticks he had seven
[1:23:49] stars. There was no more than seven.
[1:23:52] There were none less than seven. There
[1:23:54] were seven stars.
[1:23:58] And today you and
[1:24:01] I we cannot pretend to take the place of
[1:24:04] the seventh church messengers. We cannot
[1:24:07] take the place of William
[1:24:09] Vanam. If we take the place of brother
[1:24:11] Bham.
[1:24:13] We will make the scripture to fail or
[1:24:15] not to not be true
[1:24:18] and that will be eighth. But in his hand
[1:24:21] there were seven.
[1:24:24] And now the Bible is bringing the tide.
[1:24:26] In the seven
[1:24:28] streets, he commanded the seven
[1:24:30] messengers. There were seven of them.
[1:24:35] And we know
[1:24:36] today what had brought us together is
[1:24:40] the seventh messenger. Amen.
[1:24:43] Glory. Now we'll go for move forward a
[1:24:45] little bit.
[1:24:52] And the king would would call the the
[1:24:54] the his queen
[1:24:57] so that she he can present her to to
[1:25:01] them. There are things that can move
[1:25:04] forward a little bit. The Bible
[1:25:06] says and Vashta
[1:25:11] refused to come and and respond to the
[1:25:13] call of the
[1:25:15] king. And the the king was very rough,
[1:25:19] very
[1:25:20] rough. And the the wise men of the city,
[1:25:24] the the an the
[1:25:25] ancients, they were very uh uh mad
[1:25:29] mad and
[1:25:32] and they proposed to the king.
[1:25:36] It says to to make it uh to to
[1:25:41] uh verse in verse
[1:25:45] 20 even 19,
[1:25:48] if he pleases the king,
[1:25:55] Let there go a royal commandment for
[1:25:57] from him and let it be written among the
[1:26:00] law of Persian and
[1:26:02] maid that it be not
[1:26:12] altered shall come no more before the
[1:26:15] king Osiris and let the king give a
[1:26:17] royal estate unto another that is better
[1:26:19] than
[1:26:23] Let let's publish that the the queen
[1:26:26] will never appear before the king.
[1:26:28] And you know this message,
[1:26:31] it has not come for
[1:26:33] us. Now this message was addressed to
[1:26:35] the Pentecostal
[1:26:37] people. But when they rejected to accept
[1:26:40] it, they went back into the system in
[1:26:44] the
[1:26:45] ism. And God has turned his eye toward
[1:26:48] us. us.
[1:26:52] And the Bible says,
[1:26:59] John chapter one,
[1:27:01] let's read it real quick. John chapter
[1:27:14] one. I'll start reading verse 9.
[1:27:21] It speaks of the
[1:27:23] light that was the true
[1:27:33] light. He was in the
[1:27:37] way. He came out. Yeah. Which like every
[1:27:41] man cometh into he came out. Oh, he came
[1:27:44] unto his own. Yeah.
[1:27:47] and his own receive him not.
[1:27:50] He had come unto his
[1:27:53] own, and his own received him not.
[1:27:57] But as many as received him, to them
[1:28:01] gave he the power to become the sons of
[1:28:04] God, even to them that believe on his
[1:28:07] name. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:10] But those that have received
[1:28:13] him, he gave him power to become sons of
[1:28:17] God. That's why
[1:28:19] today we have believed this
[1:28:25] message. We are beneficiaries of all the
[1:28:28] resurrection power of Jesus
[1:28:30] Christ because they have rejected him.
[1:28:33] The Pentecostal have rejected him. They
[1:28:35] have rejected the message.
[1:28:38] Now William Brandham went to seek for
[1:28:40] the bride that we the bride that we are.
[1:28:43] And the Bible
[1:28:44] says to all that have received
[1:28:47] him and to believe those that I believe
[1:28:50] on his
[1:28:51] name to them gave he power to become son
[1:28:54] of God. It's God who has given power.
[1:28:58] It's God that gives you
[1:29:00] power. It's not by the choice of a man.
[1:29:03] Do you believe that?
[1:29:07] is God who gives power. It's the choice
[1:29:10] of God. Now if you are here,
[1:29:14] you are the choice of God. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:17] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:29:22] When I come to this message,
[1:29:25] I have to be
[1:29:28] sure that I am the choice of God.
[1:29:36] that God has given me power to become or
[1:29:38] to be his son. And that's what the Bible
[1:29:41] says. And the king
[1:29:44] said, "The Vasha will no longer appear
[1:29:47] before the
[1:29:49] king. She cannot appear before
[1:29:52] me and the ancient and the sages of the
[1:29:55] the of the
[1:29:56] kingdom." Now we are in verse uh in
[1:29:59] verse two in chapter two.
[1:30:03] Esther, we move forward a little bit.
[1:30:12] They
[1:30:15] said, "Let now seek in all the provinces
[1:30:18] of the
[1:30:19] city, the young ones, young
[1:30:24] women, and we will wash
[1:30:29] them. We're gonna wash them with uh
[1:30:32] special arom uh perfumes and aromas.
[1:30:37] They had a a a special bath or a special
[1:30:40] area.
[1:30:43] And the Bible speaks
[1:30:52] here in verse two. Then the king's
[1:30:55] servants and the minister let there be a
[1:30:57] fair young virgin sought for the king.
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:07] and virgin and fair young virgin uh
[1:31:11] sought for the king.
[1:31:14] Now watch verse four.
[1:31:18] Yeah, I'm just going to go a little
[1:31:22] faster. Brother one can can teach that
[1:31:25] for six months in verse
[1:31:28] four. Now let the men which pleased the
[1:31:33] king be queen instead of ashtai.
[1:31:38] And that was the advisers of the
[1:31:45] king. Now the Bible says that you know
[1:31:49] this uh uh uh thought please the king
[1:31:56] and the thing pleased the king.
[1:31:58] And now
[1:32:01] Now there was also in the capital
[1:32:03] capture city
[1:32:05] in verse
[1:32:06] five. Now in in Sushan the
[1:32:10] palace there was a certain Jew whose
[1:32:12] name was Mori.
[1:32:17] He had this his knees his niece that
[1:32:20] called
[1:32:22] Esther which means which which
[1:32:27] means and now if you go even further in
[1:32:29] the Greek
[1:32:33] Esther means star. Okay.
[1:32:38] He had she didn't have a father. She had
[1:32:41] lost her
[1:32:42] father. She had lost her mom mother.
[1:32:47] She was adopted by Morai.
[1:32:51] And Morai when he had heard of
[1:32:59] it they will pick up young virgin to be
[1:33:02] presented before the king.
[1:33:08] And I'll also make sure that I insert
[1:33:10] this young girl among to be part of the
[1:33:12] group. In verse 12, he
[1:33:17] says, "Now when every maid's turn was
[1:33:20] come to go to the king
[1:33:26] Asaris, after that which has been 12
[1:33:28] months according to the man of the
[1:33:31] women." So during that time
[1:33:35] They were taking care of
[1:33:38] them, six month with oil of
[1:33:41] myrr and six month with sweet
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:46] order and with other things for the pur
[1:33:49] purifying of the
[1:33:51] women. Now you would notice that they
[1:33:53] had a special
[1:33:56] bath and that special bath is coming
[1:33:58] from the word of
[1:34:00] God and to take away all things that are
[1:34:02] not of the world. All the things that
[1:34:05] are of the
[1:34:06] world they had a special bath there. Now
[1:34:10] if you
[1:34:11] continue
[1:34:17] now I'll go a little further.
[1:34:31] In uh uh Esther 2:20, Esther had not yet
[1:34:35] shown her kindred nor her people,
[1:34:43] nor her people.
[1:34:47] as Mori had charged her. Amen.
[1:34:54] Notice for Esther did the commandment of
[1:34:58] Mori
[1:35:00] like as
[1:35:03] when she was brought up with him.
[1:35:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:10] I don't know if you are paying attention
[1:35:11] on this. For
[1:35:14] Esther, Morai told
[1:35:17] her, "Don't reveal your identity.
[1:35:22] Don't tell them where you're coming from
[1:35:24] when you were born." No. Don't talk
[1:35:26] about it. That's right.
[1:35:28] And the Bible says
[1:35:32] she she she faithfully kept
[1:35:38] verse
[1:35:40] 20 did did the commandment of
[1:35:45] Mori like as when she was brought up
[1:35:48] with him. Amen.
[1:35:51] You notice the the the the job that we
[1:35:53] have to do. Amen.
[1:35:57] To faithfully follow
[1:36:00] what William Brham had said.
[1:36:08] faithfully and I believe that you are
[1:36:10] more privileged people than we are
[1:36:13] because came from this
[1:36:16] country and the messages started from
[1:36:18] here going everywhere around the world.
[1:36:21] Please forgive me.
[1:36:25] And this time I feel like I'm really
[1:36:26] hot.
[1:36:34] And this girl, this young girl,
[1:36:37] the Bible says,
[1:36:40] it's a type of a church,
[1:36:44] a woman,
[1:36:46] is a type of a of a of of a church.
[1:36:51] She faithfully
[1:36:53] followed what Mori had commanded her.
[1:36:58] Even when she was in at Morci's house,
[1:37:02] under the the the the turing of Modi.
[1:37:05] Amen.
[1:37:07] She was faithfully following the
[1:37:08] command.
[1:37:12] Even when she was brought over there to
[1:37:14] be washed, to be presented to the king,
[1:37:18] she was still following the command of
[1:37:20] Modi.
[1:37:21] Praise the Lord. That's good.
[1:37:25] You notice what we have to do
[1:37:28] faithfully to follow faithfully
[1:37:32] what Malachi 4 have said. Amen.
[1:37:36] Amen. When brother Venom speaks, we
[1:37:40] speak. When brother Venom does not
[1:37:42] speak, we don't speak.
[1:37:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:37:51] Faithfully. We move forward a little
[1:37:52] bit.
[1:37:55] Now something
[1:37:58] happened when God is about to do
[1:38:00] something.
[1:38:02] He moves on one side and he pulls on the
[1:38:05] other side. He pulls something
[1:38:08] here and he pulls on both side. Amen.
[1:38:13] Amen. Now notice something here
[1:38:18] in verse 21 and 23 and 23. Uh 22 and 23.
[1:38:26] Now there are also uh other
[1:38:30] camel.
[1:38:33] Okay. There were also people that
[1:38:36] were other officers of the
[1:38:40] kingdom. They were also plotting against
[1:38:42] the
[1:38:45] king. Now you will notice chapter 2
[1:38:47] verse
[1:38:49] 21. In those days
[1:38:53] while Morci sat in the king's gate
[1:38:56] victim victim
[1:38:58] terish
[1:39:00] the two uh the king two king chamblings
[1:39:04] of those the keep of the
[1:39:06] lord was wrought and sought to lay hand
[1:39:10] on and sought to hand to to lay hands on
[1:39:13] the king asseras.
[1:39:17] Let's explain it clearly.
[1:39:21] They were plotting against the
[1:39:26] king. And we have the same way we have
[1:39:29] noticed that the President Trump was
[1:39:30] shot at
[1:39:33] and now Morcai had heard and Morai had
[1:39:36] heard
[1:39:39] had heard that the two chaml that were
[1:39:41] talking they had a certain
[1:39:45] movement plotting and desiring to to
[1:39:47] assassinate the king.
[1:39:50] And when he heard of it verse 22
[1:39:55] and the things were known to Machi
[1:39:59] who told it unto Esther the queen.
[1:40:03] And the Esther certified the king
[1:40:05] thereof in the in Modi's name.
[1:40:09] And when the king had verified uh the
[1:40:10] the the information the news, it was
[1:40:14] true.
[1:40:17] And those people were caught
[1:40:21] and many things had
[1:40:24] happened. He says when God is about to
[1:40:26] do
[1:40:28] something, he he works on both side.
[1:40:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:34] He prepares something on one end
[1:40:37] because he knows that he will work down
[1:40:38] the
[1:40:40] line in verse three in chapter three.
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:52] Now there was also a man that raised to
[1:40:57] power. There was
[1:41:01] Amen. Now if you read the
[1:41:03] Bible after the
[1:41:06] king, Ammon was the second man in
[1:41:08] command.
[1:41:16] Now after these things did King Asserus
[1:41:20] promote Ammon the son of Ammonada the
[1:41:23] guy the
[1:41:24] egite. He he promoted
[1:41:28] them and after the king
[1:41:31] he was like a vice president
[1:41:35] like
[1:41:37] here ammon had a lot more power a lot of
[1:41:40] power.
[1:41:42] he was uh having dominating
[1:41:47] and what he would say would actually put
[1:41:49] to action
[1:41:51] when he says something
[1:41:53] and they were executing the
[1:41:56] the now here in the
[1:42:02] Bible now when he he walks or
[1:42:06] pass when he's
[1:42:08] walking and people had to men to salute
[1:42:12] him him him a
[1:42:15] man and require a lot of honor from from
[1:42:19] the people.
[1:42:21] But there was one
[1:42:23] man that went was
[1:42:27] walking. He never stood up. He didn't
[1:42:29] care.
[1:42:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:34] You know the book of Daniel in the
[1:42:38] Bible said everyone had to bow down to
[1:42:41] the statute.
[1:42:44] Daniel says, "No, I can't do it.
[1:42:47] I cannot bow
[1:42:49] down throw you in the the lion den." He
[1:42:52] says, "Even if you throw me there
[1:42:55] to worship the statue."
[1:42:59] It's the same with Modi.
[1:43:02] He had the character.
[1:43:07] He could not compromise with anything.
[1:43:10] Amen. He says me
[1:43:13] bow down before. No.
[1:43:19] And Ammon noticed it.
[1:43:22] And the Bible
[1:43:37] says when Ammon noticed
[1:43:42] it, he desired to kill him.
[1:43:47] Not only him alone
[1:43:49] and all his people after him.
[1:43:53] because he knew that Modi was a
[1:43:56] Jew. Said that all the provinces of the
[1:43:58] city of the country prophets and there
[1:44:00] were many Jews scattered all over.
[1:44:05] Now, do you believe that you are Israel
[1:44:06] spiritually?
[1:44:10] He
[1:44:12] says, "We have to kill this man."
[1:44:16] And he would say, you talk to the
[1:44:19] king. He said, "King, I'm going to give
[1:44:21] you a lot of
[1:44:23] money and then you will throw it in your
[1:44:26] treasury." And you read in the
[1:44:30] Bible and the king was very happy and he
[1:44:34] says, "Oh king,
[1:44:37] this is in all your provinces,
[1:44:41] even here in the capital
[1:44:46] city and there are a group of people
[1:44:48] that do not follow the the king
[1:44:50] commandments.
[1:44:55] And I would like the king to
[1:44:57] sign a a command or a
[1:45:01] decree so that I can kill all this group
[1:45:04] of people.
[1:45:07] And he was favored by the
[1:45:10] king. And you can read it here in the
[1:45:12] Bible in verse
[1:45:14] 9. And if you please the
[1:45:18] king, let it be written that they may be
[1:45:22] destroyed. and I will pay 10,000 talent
[1:45:25] of
[1:45:26] silver to the hands of those that
[1:45:29] have and to those that have the charge
[1:45:32] of the business to bring it into the
[1:45:33] kingdom. And the king took off his ring,
[1:45:39] his ring from his head and gave it to
[1:45:43] Ammon. That was a Jew's enemy.
[1:45:49] Ammon a Jew's enemy.
[1:45:53] Okay. He says yes.
[1:46:00] He had prepare a gallow so that they
[1:46:02] can't kill Mori.
[1:46:05] He had a
[1:46:09] project so that they can't kill all the
[1:46:12] Jews.
[1:46:14] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:46:18] I want to tell you something good. Amen.
[1:46:23] God has a purpose for every single one
[1:46:25] of us.

[1:46:31] of us. And brother Benham says

[1:49:05] you are here to fulfill a purpose. Amen.
[1:49:07] Amen.

[1:49:10] The same as my finger is here for a
[1:49:12] purpose.

[1:49:39] shown when he will be placed
[1:49:42] here. He was put
[1:49:46] here to fulfill the purpose in which it
[1:49:48] was intended.
[1:49:53] It was the plan of God to do
[1:49:57] so. We have been placed here for a
[1:50:00] purpose. Watch something here.
[1:50:04] Therefore, there could be
[1:50:08] nothing can kill us as long as the
[1:50:10] purpose of God is fulfilled.

[1:50:19] sickness. He says nothing can destroy
[1:50:22] us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:25] He says nothing can destroy us.
[1:50:30] Yeah. There you go. Nothing can arm us
[1:50:34] until the purpose of God has been put
[1:50:35] here for has been made
[1:50:40] manifest. No, nothing can

[1:51:06] says, "Nothing can arm
[1:51:11] us until that purpose that God has put
[1:51:14] us here for has been made
[1:51:18] manifest, no matter how much trouble we
[1:51:22] have, how much how much heartache and
[1:51:25] sorrows that we go
[1:51:27] through, all of these are are reasons
[1:51:33] There is a reason for it.
[1:51:38] He continues to say
[1:51:43] he's speaking about Noah. He talks about
[1:51:45] Noah.
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:50] He says the floor that come. I'm going

[1:52:12] There is nothing that can defeat it.
[1:52:17] So how much are we to be happy
[1:52:23] today resting resting upon the beautiful
[1:52:26] revelation of the word of the living
[1:52:29] God that there
[1:52:31] is neither things present nor things
[1:52:34] that can help there is no sickness no

[1:52:55] mind what God has imagined in his mind
[1:52:58] about you for you. Amen.
[1:53:03] Amen. All of this scripture we apply it
[1:53:06] to
[1:53:07] ourselves. He says everything that God
[1:53:09] has imagined in his
[1:53:12] mind. What God has purposed in his
[1:53:15] heart to bring it to pass. There is no
[1:53:18] demon.
[1:53:21] There's no power.
[1:53:23] There is nothing.
[1:53:27] There is nothing that can ever separate
[1:53:30] God's immortal eternal plan.
[1:53:33] Amen.
[1:53:36] It must be as God has said.
[1:53:40] If God has purposed you to be his son,
[1:53:43] And to be in this last day,
[1:53:47] you will always believe this message.
[1:53:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:53:53] God has a purpose for every single one
[1:53:56] of us.

[1:54:00] confidence when we walk.
[1:54:04] You have to know that you you you are in
[1:54:06] the choice of God.
[1:54:09] The purpose of God in my life. Amen.
[1:54:13] I can be
[1:54:14] sick. I can have uh different things
[1:54:17] happening. I can suffer.
[1:54:22] It's not that things that would actually
[1:54:24] hinder the purpose of God to be
[1:54:29] fulfilled. No, it's not the one who shot
[1:54:31] at the President Trump to be president.
[1:54:34] God saw him to be president.
[1:54:37] That's why the bullet cross
[1:54:40] him. is the same with your life. It's
[1:54:43] the same thing with my life.
[1:54:46] What God has placed for your for your
[1:54:49] life must be fulfilled in your
[1:54:53] life. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:56] And you believe you
[1:54:58] understand now.
[1:55:03] and Ammon set the plan
[1:55:07] to destroy the
[1:55:09] Jews and so forth.
[1:55:13] That was his
[1:55:19] plan. Now my subject is then the
[1:55:23] contrary happened.
[1:55:26] Amen.
[1:55:30] He planned he set up a plan.
[1:55:35] Then he even let the king to approve it.
[1:55:41] He actually allowed the king to sign the
[1:55:44] degree. Amen. Thank you
[1:55:47] Lord. But the the 13th day or at a
[1:55:51] certain date specific
[1:55:55] date they will destroy all the Jews in
[1:55:57] the promise of the king province of the
[1:56:01] king. But notice something here at the
[1:56:04] same
[1:56:08] time and as all the the young virgin was
[1:56:11] passing in front of the king,
[1:56:15] maybe they will help they will uh allow
[1:56:18] them to walk in the certain
[1:56:20] house and before they go before the king
[1:56:25] and they'll let them pass by the king
[1:56:27] and after the the bath or the toilet or
[1:56:30] after a certain period of
[1:56:32] time they will actually pass all walk
[1:56:35] before the king and the Bible says in
[1:56:38] the book of
[1:56:39] Esther. Now if the the king looks and
[1:56:42] approve of her
[1:56:46] and he will raise his
[1:56:49] staff and that specific young
[1:56:53] virgin had to replace Bashai.
[1:56:58] I'm not going to read but you read
[1:56:59] yourself.
[1:57:02] It's not a a long a a a long book I
[1:57:06] think to read.
[1:57:11] Now, something particular
[1:57:16] happened before the young girl to be
[1:57:18] presented before the
[1:57:20] king, she went through a certain
[1:57:23] house. In that very specific
[1:57:26] house, there were many different things.
[1:57:28] There were many
[1:57:31] gifts. And one girl will say, "Oh, I'm
[1:57:34] going to take this and I'll take a
[1:57:37] Cadillac. I'll take all of these big
[1:57:40] things and I'll take a little bit
[1:57:43] makeup and to be
[1:57:45] beautiful and all of these
[1:57:47] things. But when she went just before
[1:57:50] the
[1:57:51] king and she was already carrying a lot
[1:57:54] of stuff in her head, you noticed
[1:57:58] Okay. And the king would just unsimply
[1:58:03] understand. She does not desire to be a
[1:58:06] queen.
[1:58:08] She want gifts.
[1:58:11] Do you
[1:58:13] understand? She does not desire to to
[1:58:15] actually be a queen. But watch
[1:58:20] Esther that was led by Mori.
[1:58:24] Modi told her
[1:58:28] now even if you go through the house
[1:58:30] don't take anything.
[1:58:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:36] Because Esther was telling herself
[1:58:40] if I have the approval of the king
[1:58:44] I will be king queen
[1:58:47] and if I'm
[1:58:49] queen all of these things will belong to
[1:58:51] me. The bride
[1:58:55] today is founded on the
[1:58:58] revelation, the revelation of the word.
[1:59:02] And that's what makes the difference
[1:59:03] between us and the rest of the people.
[1:59:07] Amen. Amen. Glory.
[1:59:11] And Esther had that
[1:59:15] revelation. She was following the
[1:59:18] command of Modi,
[1:59:20] faithfully following the command as he
[1:59:23] was she was in the time in the house of
[1:59:24] Morai.
[1:59:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:31] And that's the same as the bride of the
[1:59:33] end time
[1:59:35] must follow William Random
[1:59:39] and faithfully follow.
[1:59:44] Esther presented herself before the
[1:59:45] king.
[1:59:47] She had absolutely nothing.
[1:59:51] She was telling herself in her heart,
[1:59:54] if I can find favor before the king,
[1:59:57] before the king, all of these things,
[2:00:00] all these kingdom will belong to me.
[2:00:07] And all these women pass uh pass.
[2:00:11] And in her turn,
[2:00:13] the Bible says,
[2:00:16] She found favor before the king
[2:00:21] and the king lift up himself
[2:00:25] and she was the one that was chosen to
[2:00:26] be
[2:00:27] queen is the same as
[2:00:30] today that we're not part of the
[2:00:32] promise.
[2:00:33] We are part we are partakers of the
[2:00:37] promise and today we are the bride of
[2:00:39] Jesus Christ.
[2:00:43] Yeah. Amen.
[2:00:46] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:51] We'll continue. Amen. In verse four,
[2:01:00] and now she installed herself to be
[2:01:02] queen.
[2:01:04] In verse three,
[2:01:09] Ammon planned to destroy all of them.
[2:01:11] Amen. Amen.
[2:01:14] a plan its own project
[2:01:19] in in chapter chapter 4 verse one.
[2:01:24] Yeah, I'll try to watch the time.
[2:01:28] Pastor, what time am I supposed to stop?
[2:01:43] and
[2:01:46] Mori perceive all that was done.
[2:01:51] Modi rent his clothes.
[2:01:56] When he heard of the plan of
[2:01:59] Ammon to kill Mori
[2:02:02] to kill the the Jew the
[2:02:05] Jews. He rented his clothes
[2:02:10] and cover himself with sackcloth
[2:02:13] and with
[2:02:18] uh and put on sackloth with
[2:02:24] ashes and went out into the midst of the
[2:02:27] city and cried with a loud and bitter
[2:02:31] cry and came even before the king's
[2:02:33] gate.
[2:02:37] For none might be enter into the king's
[2:02:39] gate clothed with sackcloth
[2:02:47] and the servant of Esther
[2:02:50] and the the guards of Esther FBI all the
[2:02:53] FBI and
[2:02:56] and I'm I'm
[2:02:57] talking and and I'm bringing it to the
[2:02:59] present time and all the security of the
[2:03:02] king of the queen.
[2:03:06] He says there's a man that is sitting
[2:03:08] there in sack cloth at the
[2:03:10] door. We cannot allow such a
[2:03:14] man with sack cloth to be around the
[2:03:16] palace and in the white house. Okay? And
[2:03:21] they
[2:03:22] ran and they went to
[2:03:25] ask went to notify Esther.
[2:03:29] And now if you noticed
[2:03:34] Esther has taken the uh the clo
[2:03:41] clothes. She had take taken some clothes
[2:03:45] and give it to one of the unic to give
[2:03:47] to Morai
[2:03:49] and to bring it to Mori.
[2:03:55] Now they can kill you if you sit here
[2:03:56] Morai.
[2:03:59] But you have to uh be well dressed or
[2:04:01] dress this cold. Uh where this clothes
[2:04:05] that something good
[2:04:09] the Bible
[2:04:11] says according to the law of men and
[2:04:17] Persians no man was allowed to actually
[2:04:20] present himself before the
[2:04:22] king if the king does not approve or
[2:04:24] call them.
[2:04:30] If the king does not call you, do not
[2:04:33] go. If you go, they will kill
[2:04:38] you. Esther
[2:04:41] knew
[2:04:42] it. She knew the
[2:04:44] law and she said to
[2:04:50] Mori, "How can I present myself before
[2:04:52] the king?"
[2:04:55] No,
[2:04:57] there's a law that exists.
[2:05:05] Verse 12,
[2:05:08] uh, chapter 4:12.
[2:05:12] And they told to Mori, Esther's word,
[2:05:23] there's somewhere there
[2:05:33] Now, there's a place here that Esther
[2:05:36] told Mori for all the Jews to fast
[2:05:40] for three
[2:05:41] days and three
[2:05:45] nights. in verse
[2:05:50] 11 and all the king's servant. It was
[2:05:54] verse 11 that the king did not call her.
[2:05:59] Now, verse
[2:06:02] 13, you read all of this. Read the Bible
[2:06:06] at
[2:06:06] home. Verse 13.
[2:06:10] Then Mori commanded to answer Esther,
[2:06:18] think not with thyself that thou shall
[2:06:21] escape in the king's house.
[2:06:24] That because you are in the house, the
[2:06:26] king's house.
[2:06:29] Morionsibility places Esther before a
[2:06:34] responsibility. You will not escape
[2:06:37] alone because because because you are in
[2:06:39] the house of the
[2:06:41] king in the following
[2:06:43] verse. It really pleases me.
[2:06:47] For verse 14,
[2:06:51] for if thou altogether holdest that
[2:06:57] peace at any at this time, then shall
[2:07:01] they enlargement and deliverance.
[2:07:07] arise to the Jews from another place.
[2:07:13] But thou and thy father's house shall be
[2:07:16] destroyed.
[2:07:21] Now then shall they enlargement and
[2:07:24] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[2:07:26] another place, but thou and thy father's
[2:07:29] house shall be destroyed.
[2:07:37] Now watch what the this chapter says in
[2:07:41] continuing verse
[2:07:43] 14. And who
[2:07:47] knoweth, whether thou are come to the
[2:07:52] kingdom for such a time as this. Amen.
[2:07:58] Who
[2:08:00] knows? If it's not the time as this
[2:08:04] that you have come to this
[2:08:06] place to the kingdom. Amen. Amen.
[2:08:11] That's why we have to have love
[2:08:13] who knows where you are.
[2:08:18] It is actually appointed for this
[2:08:20] time to to support the brother to
[2:08:24] support the sister.
[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:28] But if you were
[2:08:31] You notice that if you let it go, you'll
[2:08:33] be per you'll perish with you and your
[2:08:34] family.
[2:08:37] And the Bible says,
[2:08:46] help enlargement and
[2:08:50] deliverance will arise to the Jews from
[2:08:53] another place.
[2:08:56] But if you don't do anything,
[2:08:59] if you are a a self, if you are selfish,
[2:09:05] if you don't do anything,
[2:09:09] notice two second Timothy chapter
[2:09:14] 3. It speaks of the characteristic of
[2:09:17] the end
[2:09:19] time. They can project it.
[2:09:22] It
[2:09:25] says people will be selfish.
[2:09:32] They will be blasphemous.
[2:09:36] Blasphemous. Yeah.
[2:09:41] They will have a form of godliness.
[2:09:45] But
[2:09:46] denying the power thereof
[2:09:51] is the characteristic of the end time.
[2:09:56] And Monica showed
[2:09:58] to people selfish. They want everything
[2:10:01] for themsel.
[2:10:03] That's true.
[2:10:05] If you notice in this age,
[2:10:10] We already we always talk about God in
[2:10:12] human
[2:10:14] flesh which is of course a scripture
[2:10:16] that is fulfilled in this end time.
[2:10:20] But if you notice there's a Bible here
[2:10:23] second
[2:10:24] Timothy. We we have to read
[2:10:27] this second Timothy chapter
[2:10:32] 3 and when I will preach I'm just going
[2:10:35] to preach it.
[2:10:41] This know also that in the last day
[2:10:44] perilous time shall come for men shall
[2:10:46] be lovers of their own self.
[2:10:50] They will be love of the of their own
[2:10:52] self.
[2:10:53] Coveters, boasters, proud blasphemers,
[2:10:57] disobedience to parents,
[2:11:00] children that disobedient to their
[2:11:03] parents, unthankful, unholy,
[2:11:09] It is the characteristic of this end
[2:11:11] time.
[2:11:14] It is the scripture that has to be
[2:11:15] fulfilling this time. That's true.
[2:11:20] The children will be disobedient to
[2:11:21] their parents.
[2:11:26] It's different than the the message of
[2:11:28] William Brham.
[2:11:31] The message the will of Miriam
[2:11:34] to teach us taught us as children
[2:11:39] to respect our parents.
[2:11:42] Yes.
[2:11:49] The message is a higher civilization.
[2:11:56] It It's It's classic. It's classization.
[2:12:02] It's the highest civilization. Amen.
[2:12:06] That shows all that shows all things the
[2:12:08] way that it is.
[2:12:10] Everything has to be placed in position
[2:12:12] in its own place. Yes. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:18] Me as a children, I'll respect my
[2:12:20] parents.
[2:12:22] I obey my
[2:12:24] parent. But today children the Bible
[2:12:27] says
[2:12:29] there will be perilous time.
[2:12:32] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:34] We're just going to not we'll move on.
[2:12:38] Now I want you to
[2:12:41] noticed Ammon had planned had the
[2:12:44] project.
[2:12:46] He had uh uh pushed the king to sign or
[2:12:49] to
[2:12:51] decree so that the king can sign.
[2:12:56] And the project was to destroy all the
[2:12:58] Jews.
[2:13:01] And now Esther said to Ammon,
[2:13:04] "H verse 15,"
[2:13:09] Esther said to
[2:13:10] Mori,
[2:13:13] "Go gather all the the the Jews that are
[2:13:16] in Susan.
[2:13:20] Fast for ye for me,
[2:13:23] neither eat nor drink three
[2:13:29] days or day.
[2:13:32] I
[2:13:34] also and my maidens will fast
[2:13:38] likewise. So I will uh will I go into
[2:13:41] the unto the
[2:13:42] king which even the law requires
[2:13:47] which is not according to the law. But
[2:13:50] if I perish I perish.
[2:13:54] But
[2:13:56] you fast
[2:14:02] and they
[2:14:04] fasted. There are some
[2:14:07] situations in the life of a Christian of
[2:14:10] a
[2:14:11] believer. We have to
[2:14:16] fast. We have to put everything
[2:14:21] aside and just eat something simple or
[2:14:25] little
[2:14:26] for prayer.
[2:14:31] Prayer is part of the the uh the weapons
[2:14:34] of a of a believer.
[2:14:36] Amen. Amen.
[2:14:42] A believer cannot just sit there and not
[2:14:45] pray. He says,
[2:14:47] "Go gather all the
[2:14:51] Jews, pray for
[2:14:53] me, fast for
[2:14:55] me." And I know that the there's a law
[2:14:58] that
[2:15:01] says if the king does not call you don't
[2:15:04] get close
[2:15:06] if I perish I perish. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:13] She has taken the responsibility of the
[2:15:15] thing.
[2:15:19] We have to take the responsibility.
[2:15:22] This church,
[2:15:24] it's not just for brother one.
[2:15:27] It's for all for you too. It's for the
[2:15:29] brother. It's for the sister. Amen.
[2:15:33] Every single one where wherever you are,
[2:15:36] wherever you are,
[2:15:39] do something so that the church can move
[2:15:41] forward. Amen.
[2:15:44] If you have to pray for the church, pray
[2:15:47] for the church.
[2:15:50] And remember, brother, when you preached
[2:15:51] the the teaching on Moses, he says,
[2:15:56] He says, "The mother of
[2:15:59] Moses, Abra, Abra, you will tell
[2:16:02] Abraham,
[2:16:06] you come from work, you're very tired,
[2:16:11] you have to actually go to the
[2:16:13] attic in the the the
[2:16:17] the room to
[2:16:21] pray and somebody else cannot do it.
[2:16:26] Abraham
[2:16:28] said if somebody does not do it I will
[2:16:31] have to do it.
[2:16:34] No matter how tired I am. No matter how
[2:16:37] tired you are
[2:16:40] pray for the church. Pray for the
[2:16:43] children.
[2:16:45] Amen.
[2:16:47] We have the responsibility to pray for
[2:16:50] our children.
[2:16:55] We're living in the very uh uh
[2:16:58] in a bad in a in a a bad age. Yeah. In a
[2:17:02] rotten uh uh uh city.
[2:17:07] There's no Bibles in in in schools
[2:17:09] anymore.
[2:17:12] They remove God out of the schools.
[2:17:16] If you don't pray for your children,
[2:17:19] the consequences will be
[2:17:22] even greater. Amen.
[2:17:26] We have to pray for our
[2:17:29] children. I have quotes
[2:17:32] here. It says mother have to pray for
[2:17:34] the children.
[2:17:37] I have a citation or quotes. I'm not
[2:17:40] going to read it here.
[2:17:44] We have to pray for our children it's
[2:17:47] not that the problem but
[2:17:50] now after they had prayed
[2:17:56] and the Esther went before the king
[2:17:59] verse chapter
[2:18:01] 5 verse
[2:18:03] one. Now it came to pass on the third
[2:18:10] day. Now if you watch carefully the the
[2:18:14] mathematics of God are very respected.
[2:18:15] The seventh day, the third
[2:18:19] day Esther put on her royal apparel.
[2:18:25] What does the royal apparel means?
[2:18:29] It's the Holy Ghost.
[2:18:32] Amen.
[2:18:34] And Esther put on her royal
[2:18:39] apparel and stood in the inner court of
[2:18:41] the king's
[2:18:43] house over against the king's
[2:18:47] house. And the king sat upon this royal
[2:18:50] throne and in the royal house verse
[2:18:55] two. And when the king saw Esther the
[2:18:57] queen standing in the court,
[2:19:01] he obtained favor in the in his sight.
[2:19:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. Amen.
[2:19:09] When the queen the king saw Esther,
[2:19:16] she obtained favor before the king.
[2:19:19] Amen. Amen.
[2:19:21] But but there was a law.
[2:19:23] If they don't call you, what was it? It
[2:19:27] was the contrary that happened that's
[2:19:29] happened.
[2:19:31] The contrary of the
[2:19:34] law and the king straight forth his his
[2:19:37] staff.
[2:19:40] And Esther had entered.
[2:19:43] Verse three, the king
[2:19:44] says, "What will thou Queen Esther?
[2:19:48] And what is thy request?
[2:19:53] It shall be even given to thee the half
[2:19:55] of the kingdom. Amen. It shall be given
[2:19:58] to you. Amen.
[2:20:01] Amen. It is not what William asked
[2:20:04] brother sister.
[2:20:08] If if you want this whole house filled
[2:20:10] with money,
[2:20:15] it will be given to you right here.
[2:20:21] Now you see the power that is into your
[2:20:23] in your hand. Yeah.
[2:20:26] Esther answered
[2:20:29] verse
[2:20:32] seven says, "My petition, my request
[2:20:36] is if I found favor in the sight of the
[2:20:40] king, if he pleased the king to grant my
[2:20:45] petition that to perform my request, let
[2:20:47] the king and Ammon come to a banquet."
[2:20:50] Amen.
[2:20:52] I'm going to organize a banquet
[2:20:54] in that specific uh feast called banquet
[2:20:58] make the king come with amen.
[2:21:02] Amen. And I will have two
[2:21:06] banquets for two for two days. the first
[2:21:10] day I'll have a banquet where all of you
[2:21:13] guys will
[2:21:14] eat and the following day the
[2:21:19] same and the king came and ate
[2:21:24] you can read the whole
[2:21:27] chapter now now
[2:21:32] and the second
[2:21:35] day now the night of the second
[2:21:39] day or verse six. Chapter 6 now verse
[2:21:45] one. On that night,
[2:21:49] could not the king
[2:21:52] sleep, he he commanded to bring the book
[2:21:56] of
[2:21:57] record, the the record of the
[2:22:01] chronicles that they were read before
[2:22:03] the king.
[2:22:10] Then there it was found written that
[2:22:12] Morci had told of Betam and
[2:22:16] Teres the two of the king's chamblants
[2:22:19] the keeper of the
[2:22:22] door who sought to lay hands on the king
[2:22:25] Assyus. You see how God does
[2:22:29] things. She organized a banquet the
[2:22:32] first day
[2:22:34] and she never actually expose her
[2:22:36] request or tell her this request. She
[2:22:39] kept it.
[2:22:42] She said you have to come again the
[2:22:43] second
[2:22:45] day and the feast was continued and
[2:22:48] bring Ammon as well. That was your his
[2:22:50] vice
[2:22:52] president. And they went also the second
[2:22:54] day. But that very night
[2:22:58] the king did not sleep.
[2:23:01] He was having an insomnia. He didn't
[2:23:04] sleep.
[2:23:11] And sometime when you don't sleep at
[2:23:14] night. He said, "Let me just play
[2:23:16] brother Benham a little bit throughout
[2:23:17] the night
[2:23:19] and I'll just take a book
[2:23:22] and the king
[2:23:25] and call all the rock commander to bring
[2:23:28] the book. of record of
[2:23:33] chronicles. He he started
[2:23:40] reading. He he find out that there was a
[2:23:42] man that had saved me from being
[2:23:46] assassinated. It was
[2:23:49] Mori that saved my life that day. But
[2:23:52] what what did they give to him? Like
[2:23:54] what did they do for him?
[2:24:00] I don't think that they recompense or
[2:24:02] give anything to him. Are you tired?
[2:24:05] [Music]
[2:24:07] Can I move forward a little bit?
[2:24:09] I don't want to take too much time.
[2:24:13] It's been two years that I never been
[2:24:14] here.
[2:24:18] Just a little bit more time. I'm coming
[2:24:20] to the end here.
[2:24:25] says, "What have you guys done to this
[2:24:29] man?" He said,
[2:24:33] "Nothing." But who is in in the court in
[2:24:37] in the whole court of the king?
[2:24:41] He says, "Oh, there's Ammon that is
[2:24:42] coming. He's just walking in."
[2:24:46] Ammon went in. He said, "Call him."
[2:24:49] Ammon. Ammon.
[2:24:51] What can we do?
[2:24:58] to honor the man that had saved the
[2:25:00] king's
[2:25:02] life and very proud air
[2:25:07] ammon can only be me. I mean only me.
[2:25:10] Who
[2:25:13] else? And they have to take verse
[2:25:17] eight. And Ammon says to the
[2:25:21] king, "For the men whom the king
[2:25:23] delightth to
[2:25:25] honor, let the royal appear be
[2:25:28] brought, which the king
[2:25:31] usth, and the horse that the king ride
[2:25:36] upon, and the crown royal, which is set
[2:25:39] upon his
[2:25:42] head, and let this appear or horse be
[2:25:45] delivered into the hands of one
[2:25:48] and that they may array the men with all
[2:25:50] that whom the kings delighted to
[2:25:54] honor and bring him in horseback
[2:25:56] throughout the street of the city and
[2:25:59] proclaim before
[2:26:03] him. Thus shall it be done to the men
[2:26:05] whom the king delightth to honor. Amen.
[2:26:10] Amen. He says, Ammon,
[2:26:14] call Morai.
[2:26:18] You do the same to Modi. Amen. Amen.

[2:26:48] The Bible says
[2:26:52] he does all things at the right time.
[2:26:56] Amen. Amen.
[2:26:58] And the Bible says the brother says
[2:27:03] the way up
[2:27:06] is down. Amen.
[2:27:12] If you want to be promoted, try to be
[2:27:15] humble. Come
[2:27:18] down. Brother, preach a message. Humble
[2:27:21] thyself.
[2:27:25] He caused the bride to humble herself.
[2:27:27] Amen.
[2:27:29] We have to be humble.
[2:27:33] Humility is not be trashed at
[2:27:39] humility.
[2:27:41] Is to believe and to obey the word.
[2:27:44] That's right. It's not to be dirty. No.
[2:27:50] If you have a a
[2:27:52] a tie to give me, you give me me. I'll
[2:27:57] wear it.
[2:27:58] I love a a tie.
[2:28:03] It's not pride to be pride. Proud.
[2:28:09] No, I am humble in my heart.
[2:28:13] You have to be humble in your heart.
[2:28:16] You have to be humble in your heart. I'm
[2:28:18] continuing. Let's continue. Brother says
[2:28:23] the way up
[2:28:25] is down.
[2:28:32] And Ammon took Machi and and put him in
[2:28:35] the horse back. Ammon alone
[2:28:40] and we're trying to bring Malachi with
[2:28:42] with the the horse around

[2:29:02] He was rewarded.
[2:29:06] Amen. Amen.
[2:29:10] Let's move forward a little bit faster
[2:29:13] now.
[2:29:14] Verse chapter 7.
[2:29:19] Now the king and Ammon came to the the
[2:29:22] banquet of Esther the

[2:29:41] is that
[2:29:43] request? even the half of the kingdom
[2:29:46] you would obtain
[2:29:47] it. And they asked to the queen answered
[2:29:49] and said, "If I have found favor in your
[2:29:53] sight, oh
[2:29:54] king," now let's pay attention. I'm
[2:29:56] coming to the end
[2:29:58] now. If I find if he pleases the
[2:30:03] king, now if he pleases the
[2:30:07] king, let my life be given me at my
[2:30:10] petition.
[2:30:12] That's that's my petition
[2:30:16] and my people at my request
[2:30:19] and that's my desire. That's my
[2:30:21] petition.
[2:30:26] And the the king says I already signed a
[2:30:31] decree to kill all the
[2:30:34] Jews. I had already signed
[2:30:36] it. Oh my. Oh my brother,

[2:31:04] the Bible.
[2:31:06] He says, "Thus said the Lord,
[2:31:10] And that said the Lord can be taken
[2:31:16] back. When God says that said the Lord,
[2:31:21] that's it. It happens. It will
[2:31:23] happen in a few days you will
[2:31:30] die. And the king bowed
[2:31:32] himself and pray and pray.
[2:31:37] prophet and the very same prophet
[2:31:41] came back with another that said the
[2:31:43] Lord

[2:32:08] you that can be changed. Amen. Amen.
[2:32:14] Because you are a believer. Amen.
[2:32:16] Amen. my
[2:32:18] brother says, "Give me my
[2:32:21] life." And my
[2:32:24] people and the king said,
[2:32:30] he says, "Who is
[2:32:33] he?" Where is he that does presume in
[2:32:37] his heart to do
[2:32:39] so? Who in this kingdom? And who is he?
[2:32:45] Where is he?
[2:32:47] Esther said,
[2:32:49] "The adversary and the enemy is this
[2:32:53] wicked Amon."
[2:32:56] And this wicked Amon.
[2:33:00] And then Ammon was afraid before the
[2:33:02] king and the queen. And the king arising
[2:33:07] from his banquet wine and went into the
[2:33:10] place garden
[2:33:12] and went to the the palace garden.
[2:33:17] Ammon stood up to make requests of his
[2:33:19] life to
[2:33:25] Esther for he he saw that there was evil
[2:33:28] determined against him by the
[2:33:31] king. Now Ammon trying to ask for
[2:33:34] forgiveness to the
[2:33:37] king, he went closer to the bed where
[2:33:39] Esther was
[2:33:41] laying. Now when the king came back with
[2:33:44] his in his
[2:33:46] wrath, he entered. He
[2:33:50] sees, he sees Ammon bowing down before
[2:33:53] the the bed of Esther. He said, "You
[2:33:56] want to also, you know, rape my
[2:33:58] wife." And the king was already
[2:34:01] rough and the position that he had also
[2:34:03] find Amon is even even double is
[2:34:07] rough. He says, "You want to rape my
[2:34:10] wife again?
[2:34:13] And that was the end.
[2:34:16] The end of Ammon.
[2:34:19] Now,
[2:34:23] the king grant unto Esther
[2:34:26] what? He she she requested
[2:34:31] says what do you want? Your life. I give
[2:34:34] you
[2:34:36] the life of your your
[2:34:38] people. when you had already wrote that

[2:34:43] you already seal it with your your your
[2:34:45] ring

[2:34:49] it back the king
[2:34:54] says be written
[2:34:59] and it was w in the king's name
[2:35:03] and sealed with the king's ring
[2:35:06] and letter sent letters by post on
[2:35:09] horseback and riders and mules and
[2:35:11] camels. Verse 11.
[2:35:18] By these letters,
[2:35:21] the the king gave to the
[2:35:25] Jews in no uh in every city that they
[2:35:28] gather themselves
[2:35:30] together to stand or to
[2:35:33] gather and to uh to defend the life.
[2:35:41] to avenge themselves.
[2:35:47] Follow me. We have to finish
[2:35:50] and they will go read the Bible.
[2:35:52] Homework. That's a
[2:35:54] homework. Homework. That was the
[2:35:57] homework. Amen.

[2:36:10] Now
[2:36:14] the the the the king
[2:36:16] ordered the letter they they write
[2:36:18] letters
[2:36:21] and they sealed it and send it on
[2:36:25] horseback. They did not have post
[2:36:28] office. There were no
[2:36:30] DHL, but they had
[2:36:33] horses and they would seal those letters
[2:36:36] and they sent it away. But now
[2:36:39] watch, if you read the
[2:36:44] Bible, the king never annoyed.
[2:36:55] Read the Bible.
[2:36:58] But the second one that the the king
[2:37:02] [Music]
[2:37:03] sent give the power to the Jews to
[2:37:07] defend themsel.
[2:37:11] Now the day that the the battle had to
[2:37:14] happen, it says wherever they
[2:37:17] are, may they gather themselves
[2:37:19] together. May they defend or avenge
[2:37:22] themselves. Do you understand? But at
[2:37:24] that
[2:37:26] moment, Ammon is already dead. Now watch
[2:37:30] what happens.
[2:37:38] Ammon was hanged on the same tree that
[2:37:41] he he planned for Morai to be hanged on.
[2:37:46] That if somebody want to do wrong to
[2:37:47] you,
[2:37:49] he would turn back to him.
[2:37:52] True. Amen.
[2:37:56] The same uh uh
[2:38:00] tree is the same tree that they hang
[2:38:03] posted a hang
[2:38:05] amen and all the letter was
[2:38:11] sent verse 15.
[2:38:16] And Mori went out from the presence of
[2:38:18] the
[2:38:20] king in royal appear blue and white
[2:38:25] and a great crown of gold
[2:38:30] and with a garment of fine linen and
[2:38:32] purple
[2:38:34] and Mori came
[2:38:35] out. I
[2:38:39] remember brother Benham speaks of a
[2:38:42] dream that they saw him in the in the
[2:38:44] horse
[2:38:47] somewhere and to preach the
[2:38:53] gospel with eyes like flaming
[2:38:57] fire. He was lifted
[2:39:01] on the other
[2:39:03] side. And when he saw the vision on the
[2:39:06] other side beyond the curtain of time,
[2:39:08] he says,
[2:39:11] he says all, he asked himself, is all of
[2:39:13] these things,
[2:39:15] he says no
[2:39:17] is those that you have called to Christ,
[2:39:19] you have brought to Christ by your
[2:39:22] message. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:39:26] And they have taken him
[2:39:29] and they have elevated a little bit
[2:39:31] higher
[2:39:33] is because he says because on earth you
[2:39:36] were a king and you you were a chief.
[2:39:40] Amen. Amen.
[2:39:43] You a chief on earth. It says
[2:39:47] verse uh
[2:39:53] 16 the light
[2:39:57] [Music]
[2:39:58] glad joy and honor.
[2:40:01] Amen. Joy and honor
[2:40:07] because the plan of Modi of Amen.
[2:40:11] Amen. The project of Ammon
[2:40:15] was the contrary that had happened.
[2:40:18] Amen. Amen.
[2:40:20] Verse 9, chapter 9, the Bible says
[2:40:27] 91. Now in the 12th month that that is
[2:40:31] the month of Ad the 13th day of the the
[2:40:36] same when the king's command and the
[2:40:39] decree drew near to be to be put in
[2:40:44] execution in the day that the enemy of
[2:40:46] the Jew hoped to to have power over them
[2:40:50] though he was turned to the contrary.
[2:40:55] Do you understand now? When that
[2:40:59] day the king never changed his first
[2:41:02] letter was his first decree.
[2:41:05] But the second
[2:41:06] stop, the second
[2:41:09] commandment, the second that said the
[2:41:13] Lord gave the Jews the power to defend
[2:41:16] themselves.
[2:41:18] But that day when he had happened,
[2:41:21] the bride had the power to defend
[2:41:24] herself. Amen. Amen.
[2:41:27] the bride
[2:41:29] typified by the bride.
[2:41:32] Now the Bible says that day
[2:41:36] that the the enemy of the Jews they
[2:41:38] wanted to have power over
[2:41:41] them though he was turned to the
[2:41:44] contrary that the Jews had rule over
[2:41:48] them that hated them. That's why
[2:41:52] today we have to
[2:41:55] dominate God has given us the power to
[2:41:58] rule
[2:41:59] over even at work even at the business
[2:42:05] everywhere you might
[2:42:07] be. God has given you this
[2:42:09] message to rule over to dominate.
[2:42:14] It's the what? It's the contrary that
[2:42:16] happened.
[2:42:18] Amen.
[2:42:19] the all the evil projects or wicked
[2:42:21] projects
[2:42:23] had failed
[2:42:26] it was all the project of Amen had
[2:42:30] failed I have to stop
[2:42:34] I'll read two quotes
[2:42:43] two quotes
[2:42:45] bless you brother Amen
[2:42:46] [Music]
[2:42:49] Amen. Amen.
[2:42:53] Amen.
[2:42:59] I'm just going to talk about it really
[2:43:01] quick here. Brother Benam says
[2:43:04] here, Brother Benham talks about a a a
[2:43:07] child that was sick.
[2:43:10] It's in the message. There is uh this
[2:43:13] here is someone greater than Solomon.
[2:43:16] greater than Solomon. He he preached in
[2:43:19] 19 50
[2:43:23] 58. It says that this boy was sick.
[2:43:29] He had fever, strong
[2:43:33] fever. And my computer is dead
[2:43:37] now. Brother Bham says
[2:43:40] here he was called to pray for the child
[2:43:43] and they refused.
[2:43:46] He says you are not a Catholic priest
[2:43:49] and this this child was supposed to be
[2:43:52] to die.
[2:43:55] But says that if a priest comes here,
[2:43:58] he would allow him to come
[2:44:01] in. He he would just come and give his
[2:44:03] last prayer before the the the death of
[2:44:05] the
[2:44:06] child. He said, "Me al me as well. I'm
[2:44:09] coming." He he he pressured them a
[2:44:12] little bit and they let him in.
[2:44:17] And they let him come in.
[2:44:19] Oh yeah. And when the pro prophet comes
[2:44:22] in,
[2:44:26] he says the the doctor this who
[2:44:28] specializes in this case he
[2:44:32] says and this child has only few hours
[2:44:34] to leave.
[2:44:38] He says let me pray. He prayed.
[2:44:43] And when he prayed, it was the contrary
[2:44:45] that happened. Amen. Amen. Amen. And
[2:44:49] brother says, he says, "Today,
[2:44:53] this boy,
[2:44:55] he has a wife, he has two children."
[2:44:59] Amen.
[2:45:01] Today, that's why that same God
[2:45:05] has a purpose for every single one of
[2:45:07] you. No matter what the situation, no
[2:45:10] matter your situation,
[2:45:12] It is the contrary that will happen.
[2:45:14] Amen. Amen. May God bless you.
[2:45:18] Thank you. Thank you so much.
[2:45:41] [Applause]
[2:45:50] Well, praise the Lord.
[2:45:53] We had a gift in church today. Amen.
[2:45:55] When there is when there is tongues,
[2:45:57] there should be interpretation. Yes.
[2:45:59] Amen. Amen.
[2:46:07] Well, we want to thank the
[2:46:09] Lord for that. You know, as as our
[2:46:12] brother was speaking, I want to also
[2:46:14] remind us this coming weekend is a
[2:46:16] service with brother Joe Adams. Saturday
[2:46:19] night and uh Sunday morning, but Joe
[2:46:22] will be coming from Louisiana. So s
[2:46:25] Saturday night at 6:30 we'll be seated
[2:46:29] and then uh the service on Sunday
[2:46:31] morning
[2:46:33] also. You know as our brother was
[2:46:35] speaking I was thinking about
[2:46:38] uh
[2:46:40] uh you know we've been we've been
[2:46:43] talking about the the bride position.
[2:46:45] We've been talking about the position of
[2:46:47] the woman.
[2:46:48] The beautiful thing about the book of
[2:46:50] Esther as we just close in prayer here
[2:46:53] is that uh you will realize that
[2:46:59] uh what saw if you read uh Esther
[2:47:03] chapter 2 verse
[2:47:06] 5 Esther chapter 2 verse 5 if they would
[2:47:09] just put it up for
[2:47:11] us that would just kind of capture our
[2:47:15] mind on something the Bible says As it
[2:47:18] talks about
[2:47:21] Modiiah, it also says here, look at the
[2:47:24] last word, the son of
[2:47:27] Sheamir. He was the one that spit in
[2:47:30] David's face.
[2:47:35] The son of K, a Benjamite.
[2:47:39] That's the same lineage that saw. Yes.
[2:47:43] [Music]
[2:47:46] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:47:49] Now, so God actually raised up
[2:47:53] Saul to take care of what he promised in
[2:47:56] Deuteronomy chapter 25. He said because
[2:47:59] the
[2:48:00] Amalachite were not friendly when Israel
[2:48:03] was on their journey. They refused
[2:48:06] Israel to pass through, refused to give
[2:48:09] them water, refused to give them food.
[2:48:11] So God was determined to wet them off
[2:48:15] the face of the
[2:48:18] earth. So Saul was raised up as a
[2:48:21] captain in Israel to do that
[2:48:24] work and he failed to do
[2:48:29] it. Are we together? Amen. Now, so
[2:48:32] you're going to see the the beautiful
[2:48:34] thing there is that if you look at uh uh
[2:48:37] Hammered, he was from the tribe of the
[2:48:39] Amalachites. He was a descendant of the
[2:48:41] Amalachite.
[2:48:44] So God is going to raise
[2:48:48] up a bride is going to be a female part
[2:48:53] of God.
[2:48:55] Praise the Lord. Amen. Is going to be a
[2:48:58] secret weapon.
[2:49:02] You have to realize that the the the
[2:49:05] woman's strength is hidden.
[2:49:08] her strength is is is uh uh uh
[2:49:14] uh that's that's the reason why God had
[2:49:17] to shut the
[2:49:18] earth, create darkness to be able to
[2:49:22] bring up that
[2:49:23] woman because her strength is hidden.
[2:49:30] So what Saul could not
[2:49:34] do the word of the Lord to to to
[2:49:37] eliminate these people that actually
[2:49:40] handle Israel from their journey going
[2:49:42] over to the promised land. Year is said
[2:49:45] that God had raised up a
[2:49:49] little young
[2:49:52] woman which of course is a type of the
[2:49:55] bride.
[2:49:58] Praise the Lord. Amen. The whole book of
[2:50:01] Esther, that is the secret the book of
[2:50:04] Esther
[2:50:07] holds. God still remembering his
[2:50:11] word and he will raise up for such a
[2:50:14] time like this.
[2:50:21] Saul had a mighty
[2:50:24] army. Praise the Lord. Amen. Esther only
[2:50:28] had a position. Hallelujah.
[2:50:31] Her position was she was a queen.
[2:50:36] Your strength is in your position.
[2:50:41] Who you are called to be.
[2:50:44] a son of God, a daughter of God,
[2:50:49] [Music]
[2:50:51] a mother to your children, a wife to
[2:50:54] your
[2:50:56] husband. Our strength is in our
[2:51:00] position. That's why Paul
[2:51:03] says in heavenly places, he has given
[2:51:06] us, you know, uh all power.
[2:51:12] The whole thing about the book of Esther
[2:51:14] runs back. That's the history. You run
[2:51:16] it back to Deuteronomy chapter
[2:51:19] 25. God says, "I will I will I will
[2:51:22] these people from the face of the
[2:51:25] earth. And when Saul was raised up, that
[2:51:28] was the work that God gave him to
[2:51:33] do. He took the sheep. He took all the
[2:51:37] the the best part of the animals. He
[2:51:40] spared the
[2:51:41] kings and because of that God rejected
[2:51:45] him because God means what he says and
[2:51:48] he says what he means. Amen. Amen.
[2:51:51] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:51:54] And for such a time like this, God has
[2:51:57] raised up a bride
[2:52:00] church. Praise the Lord. Amen. God has
[2:52:04] raised up a bride church, a New
[2:52:06] Testament church. That's the reason why
[2:52:08] the bride is here to do the finished
[2:52:10] work.
[2:52:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:52:15] But remember, our
[2:52:18] power is in our position.
[2:52:23] Praise the Lord. Amen. I love what he
[2:52:26] when he says that uh you know when uh
[2:52:29] when she became queen, she owns
[2:52:32] everything. Amen.
[2:52:35] [Music]
[2:52:37] and everything is given to us. Let's bow
[2:52:39] our heads and pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:52:42] Lord
[2:52:43] Jesus, oh God, what uh uh uh a trip
[2:52:48] through the book of Esther this morning
[2:52:50] we had seeing Lord how you turn things
[2:52:54] around. You are the one that is working
[2:52:57] the
[2:52:59] wheels. You are the one that is spinning
[2:53:01] the wheels of our life.
[2:53:05] You have the wheels, Lord Jesus, of our
[2:53:08] family. You have the wheels, oh God,
[2:53:10] Father, of our finances. You have the
[2:53:13] wheels of our health in your hands. Oh
[2:53:16] God, Father, Lord, and and and and this
[2:53:19] morning, Lord God, just traveling
[2:53:21] through the book of Esther, we see how
[2:53:23] you are the one pulling strings, Lord.
[2:53:26] And you pull strings because you want to
[2:53:28] bring your word to pass. Your purpose
[2:53:31] for our life is never
[2:53:35] defeated. No matter what we go through,
[2:53:38] Lord God, and no matter what we face in
[2:53:40] our life, your purpose is never
[2:53:44] defeated. So God, we can lift our hands
[2:53:46] this morning or this afternoon and say
[2:53:49] thank you that Lord God, you always turn
[2:53:52] things in the contrary, Lord, what the
[2:53:55] enemy man, oh God, Father, you always
[2:53:57] turn it in the contrary, oh God. And
[2:54:00] because Lord, you have a purpose for our
[2:54:02] life. And oh God, we just want to thank
[2:54:05] you also, Father, to realize that God
[2:54:08] for such a such a time like this, you
[2:54:11] have raised us up, oh
[2:54:13] [Music]
[2:54:17] God, such a time like this, oh God.
[2:54:20] Father when we see church life is fading
[2:54:23] out to God. Father Lord we see family
[2:54:27] life is on the brink of God. Father but
[2:54:30] such a time like this you have raising
[2:54:33] up a people you have raising up Lord
[2:54:36] Jesus. Oh God father your own bride. Oh
[2:54:39] Lord God Father Lord with an open book
[2:54:42] before us Lord Jesus the opening of the
[2:54:45] word. Oh God the pouring of the Holy
[2:54:48] Ghost. So father for such a time like
[2:54:50] this Lord Jesus that oh God we will take
[2:54:54] our position by the word because we know
[2:54:57] there were lies our power there were
[2:55:00] lies oh God father your prophet comes
[2:55:04] tell us Lord uh uh you gave the church
[2:55:06] three sacra you just like you did to the
[2:55:09] woman father God and in those virtue
[2:55:12] there her power is oh God there lies her
[2:55:16] strength in those virtue you is given to
[2:55:18] her for
[2:55:23] redemption. That's the way you think
[2:55:25] about the
[2:55:27] woman. She's not a doormat. She's not
[2:55:30] She's not inferior to you. She's your
[2:55:32] daughter. She's your queen. That's the
[2:55:34] way you think about the woman. That's
[2:55:36] the way you think about the
[2:55:39] church. That's the power you have given
[2:55:41] to the church.
[2:55:43] So we realize that
[2:55:45] submission is not a
[2:55:48] [Music]
[2:55:49] weakness. Submission is our
[2:55:52] strength. Submission is our
[2:55:55] [Music]
[2:56:00] honor. Father, may we go away from the
[2:56:02] service, Lord God, this afternoon. Oh
[2:56:05] God, just realize, you know, Father,
[2:56:08] Lord,
[2:56:09] God, that for such a time like this, you
[2:56:13] have with our heart. For such a time
[2:56:16] like this, you have watched over our
[2:56:18] life. You have you have delivered us
[2:56:20] from illnesses, oh God. You have, Lord,
[2:56:23] you have been so good to us. You have
[2:56:26] kept us, Lord, for such a time like
