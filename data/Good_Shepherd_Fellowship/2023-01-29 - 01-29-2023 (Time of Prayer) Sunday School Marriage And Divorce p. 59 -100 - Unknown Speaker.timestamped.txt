[3:45] because God has Law set together
[3:49] and uh these laws like the Sunder age
[3:53] you put a of bird in a good field
[3:56] it'll grow
[4:39] I know your question now he said I have
[4:43] gotten a man from the Lord that's
[4:44] exactly right you could take the
[4:46] honorary woman in the town the worst man
[4:48] if they had a baby you would have to
[4:50] come from the Lord
[4:51] because God has laws set together
[4:56] and these laws like the Sunder age you
[5:00] put a cocklebur in a good field it'll
[5:03] grow
[5:04] and it has to grow because it's God's
[5:06] law
[5:07] when seed is planted it must grow and
[5:11] nothing can grow life but God because it
[5:13] operates under his laws
[5:16] therefore when the evil seed was planted
[5:19] in the womb of
[5:21] of Eve it had to bring forth because
[5:24] it's God's law
[5:27] a production
[5:29] and he could do nothing else but bring
[5:31] it and it had to come from God
[5:35] that's the reason people say little baby
[5:37] sometimes it's not born with Christian
[5:39] parents are lost Jesus Christ's blood
[5:42] got tones for the child I don't care how
[5:43] much it was born how evil it was born
[5:46] he's the Lamb of God that takes away the
[5:48] sin of the world a little child cannot
[5:50] repeat because it has nothing to repent
[5:52] for and that was the sin of the world
[5:54] which was taken away by the blood of
[5:55] Christ babies go to heaven
[5:59] its original sin and that's the reason
[6:01] it's it's question
[6:05] when any great phenomena comes from God
[6:07] about the first thing what about
[6:09] marriage and divorce
[6:11] now as ever it still is a question
[6:13] amongst the people
[6:15] as it was in the times of Jesus as it
[6:18] was in the times of Moses
[6:20] it's always been and is to this day a
[6:23] question among the people because the
[6:26] people want to know what's the truth
[6:29] but where there is a question there must
[6:32] also be an answer
[6:35] and now being an answer
[6:38] as I have said before this week
[6:40] there must be a correct answer
[6:43] and if we get an answer to anything and
[6:46] it uh it isn't right
[6:49] uh then we know that it was wrong
[6:52] but there's we're still asked to tell
[6:54] the true question is answered
[6:57] if you want to know truth and being this
[7:00] is a Bible question
[7:02] it should be a Bible answer
[7:07] is like I've said if I wanted to go East
[7:10] this morning and the best that I know
[7:13] this I had to find a certain something
[7:15] in the field it was directly east and I
[7:17] went East somebody said brother Branham
[7:20] this is East
[7:21] it is East potentially but it's
[7:25] Northeast
[7:26] I would pass the very object I was
[7:29] looking for I'd come back knowing it was
[7:31] wrong
[7:32] and then if somebody said brother Graham
[7:35] go this way to your right now that is
[7:39] potentially East also but it's Southeast
[7:43] I would lose the object that I was
[7:46] looking for because I went beyond the
[7:48] boundaries of the perfect and direct way
[7:53] now
[7:55] if that be so we have two schools of
[7:58] thought on marriage and divorce
[8:01] and that is one of them says that a man
[8:04] can only be married once unless his wife
[8:06] is dead
[8:08] that's one of the questions
[8:11] but you go to following that you go
[8:13] overboard
[8:16] and then the next says oh if the wife or
[8:20] the husband either one has committed
[8:22] adultery either one of them can be put
[8:24] away and married again you find yourself
[8:27] overboard with that
[8:31] so see it's either south east or
[8:34] Northeast we won't directly east
[8:38] you run out of scripture when you go
[8:40] this way you're out of scripture when
[8:41] you go that way we want to know where
[8:43] scripture meets scripture
[8:47] I know what's the truth of it
[8:49] each takes a different way
[8:52] and failed to bring up the correct
[8:54] answer but there still must be an answer
[8:56] it's just like today
[9:00] there's two great schools of Doctrine
[9:04] in the church one of them is Calvinism
[9:08] the other is our myth armenianism
[9:12] one of them is legalist the other one is
[9:15] Grace
[9:16] and then we come to find out that the
[9:18] people who believe in grace the
[9:20] Calvinists they say bless God it don't
[9:24] hurt me to smoke it don't hurt me to
[9:26] drink I can do these things I've got
[9:29] eternal security
[9:31] then we find the other side on the
[9:34] league that said oh I would like to ball
[9:36] him out I'd like to show him a piece of
[9:38] my mind but I'm a Christian I have to
[9:40] keep still
[9:42] see you find yourself
[9:44] on two different roads
[9:47] and neither one of them is right now
[9:50] that's hard to say that
[9:52] but it is the truth
[9:54] we find ourselves on two different roads
[9:58] one going one way one another
[10:01] now let's see what truth is
[10:05] now listen and see if this sounds
[10:06] sensible to you
[10:08] for instance if I get ready go overseas
[10:12] I'll take my own family
[10:15] I'll call my wife up to me and I will
[10:18] say uh we're go I'm going overseas dear
[10:21] now here is the legalist sign
[10:25] now my wife I'm going to lay the law
[10:28] down to you
[10:29] if you flirt with any man while I'm gone
[10:33] when I come back you're a divorced woman
[10:36] and I don't want you making eyes don't
[10:38] want you flirting
[10:40] you understand that I'm your husband if
[10:42] you do it I'm going to put you away you
[10:43] want to come back
[10:45] then she reaches and gets me by the time
[10:47] and say my good man I want to tell you
[10:49] something
[10:52] that if you make eyes with any woman or
[10:54] take any woman out or flirt with any
[10:55] woman you're going to be a divorced man
[10:57] when you come back I wouldn't that be a
[10:59] happy home
[11:00] that's the legalism
[11:03] all right
[11:05] now the other side is that if I go over
[11:09] seas and uh make a mistake go over and
[11:14] say when I look I'll take this woman out
[11:16] oh it's all right my wife she don't care
[11:18] my wife said I go out this man it's all
[11:20] right Bill he don't care
[11:22] if I don't care then there's nothing
[11:24] wrong with me I don't love that woman
[11:26] right
[11:27] and if she don't care there's something
[11:28] wrong with her
[11:30] she's my wife I don't want other men
[11:31] fooling with her
[11:33] she's my wife
[11:36] now the correct way of it is
[11:38] both of them's God of truth but not the
[11:41] exact truth
[11:43] now I want to go overseas to make it
[11:45] right my little family gathers around
[11:47] him we pray with one another
[11:49] and I commit them to God and they commit
[11:52] me to God
[11:53] and when we do we go over sea I go
[11:55] overseas
[11:56] now I know she loves me I have
[11:59] confidence in her
[12:01] and I love her she's got confidence in
[12:04] me as long as I love her like that she
[12:07] don't have any worry about me taking any
[12:08] other woman out as long as she loves me
[12:11] right while there's no me me thinking
[12:13] about any other man going out with her
[12:14] because she's my wife and I believe her
[12:18] I believe if I would actually do
[12:20] something wrong make a mistake
[12:22] they go out with some woman and return
[12:25] back and would confess it to her and
[12:27] tell her media I didn't mean to do that
[12:29] I just got caught in a trap this woman
[12:31] just run right up to me and and grab you
[12:34] by the arm and started so and so I
[12:36] believe should be understanding I
[12:38] believe she would forgive me for it
[12:40] but I wouldn't do it for nothing
[12:43] because I love her though she would
[12:46] forgive me I wouldn't do it
[12:49] I wouldn't hurt her for nothing
[12:52] though I know she'd forgive me for it I
[12:55] don't want to hurt her and that's the
[12:57] way it is with God if I if a filial love
[13:00] which is human love Fellowship love can
[13:03] make a man feel out about his wife what
[13:05] about a gopal love the Greek word
[13:08] meaning the love of God how will that
[13:10] make me do about Jesus Christ
[13:12] as long as I want to go do it it's in my
[13:16] heart to do it
[13:18] whether I say as long as you say my
[13:20] heart to do it I I go do it legalism
[13:23] won't let me do it it's because I know I
[13:26] get punished for doing it but the real
[13:28] truth of it is is when the love of God
[13:31] comes into your heart to you want to do
[13:33] it
[13:34] that's the truth of it there's the two
[13:36] schools not legalism or other art the
[13:40] Calvinism it's both now
[13:44] we find out today oh so there's many
[13:46] different denominations
[13:49] there's the Catholic Church the
[13:50] Protestant Church each one of them says
[13:52] they're the way see we have the way
[13:55] we're the truth there's a Methodist says
[13:57] we have the truth the Baptist says we
[13:59] have the truth
[14:01] well to me
[14:03] as long as they feel that way it's not
[14:07] so
[14:09] because Jesus said I am the truth
[14:13] therefore is my sermon last night was
[14:15] that he is the place where God put his
[14:18] name the only place to worship you are
[14:21] not a Christian because you're a
[14:23] Protestant you're not a Christian
[14:24] because you're a Catholic you're not a
[14:26] Christian because your Methodist Baptist
[14:28] or Pentecostal you are a Christian
[14:30] because you've been baptized into Jesus
[14:32] Christ by the Holy Spirit not by water
[14:36] there's one Faith one Lord one baptism
[14:39] that's Holy Spirit baptism
[14:42] water baptisms inducts you into a
[14:45] fellowship of Holy Spirit baptism
[14:46] inducts you into Christ
[14:49] there's the truth
[14:51] we have also two thoughts of this
[14:53] marriage and divorce now that our Lord
[14:56] has opened the seven seal mystery of his
[14:59] word to us in this last days
[15:02] now many of you this might be Greek to
[15:04] you but my church understands or what
[15:08] will you serve the visions and what
[15:10] taken place
[15:11] I am the question is a Bible question we
[15:15] are invited here to believe there must
[15:19] be a true answer to the whole hidden
[15:23] secret that's been hid
[15:25] since the foundation of the world
[15:29] and the Bible prophesies and says that
[15:32] in this day these secrets would be made
[15:36] known
[15:40] Revelations 10 and at the sounding are
[15:45] the seventh angel the lady of sea
[15:48] messenger the mysteries of God would be
[15:52] made known and this is the last age
[15:54] which is laosia look at all this revival
[15:57] has went on for 15 years or more not one
[16:01] denomination come out of it
[16:03] Luther had a Revival that went into
[16:04] nomination
[16:06] Wesley that one had a denomination
[16:07] Alexander Campbell there went into
[16:09] nomination all these other great John
[16:12] Smith and so forth denominations Moody
[16:15] all along but here's been one usually a
[16:18] Revival only lasts about three years
[16:21] but this is being gone for over 15 years
[16:24] and not one denomination sprung up from
[16:26] it or this is a seed time there's no
[16:29] more shut actually one shuts gone it's
[16:32] seed God is ready if he isn't doing it
[16:35] now he's going to call a church to
[16:38] Perfection by his word Jesus Christ
[16:43] notice
[16:44] there must be an answer somewhere and
[16:47] being at the seven sealed mystery of God
[16:51] Seven Seals how many understands that
[16:53] raise up your hands you see I think most
[16:55] of them is our congregation from rounds
[16:57] listen if not the books will be out
[16:59] pretty soon upon the subject we have
[17:01] books on books on it now
[17:03] Jesus in our text invites us to go back
[17:07] to the beginning for the true spiritual
[17:10] answer
[17:12] now when he was confronted with this
[17:15] there was two things in view
[17:18] the priest said to him
[17:21] can a man put away his wife
[17:25] marry another for any cause
[17:28] and Jesus said it wasn't so from the
[17:32] beginning
[17:33] then they said
[17:35] Moses suffered us a writing of
[17:37] divorcement and to put away for anything
[17:40] they wanted to
[17:41] he said that Moses did that because
[17:47] letting that straight away
[17:49] because of the hardness of your hearts
[17:54] but
[17:56] from or at the beginning it wasn't so
[18:03] the question
[18:05] the question today like a world peace
[18:08] is it coming by politics Union
[18:11] of Nations United
[18:13] I say to you Nate
[18:16] it's always failed at will again but
[18:19] there remains a true answer to the
[18:21] question
[18:23] will there be peace upon the Earth yes
[18:25] When sin is written off of the earth
[18:28] there will be peace
[18:31] but until that time there will be no
[18:34] peace
[18:35] Nation will rise against nation and
[18:37] Kingdom against Kingdom
[18:41] God gave a remedy for sin
[18:44] listen close now God gave the remedy to
[18:48] rid sin off the Earth
[18:51] but man of the Earth won't accept God's
[18:55] remedy
[18:58] God gave us a remedy and a way to marry
[19:01] our wives and live with them
[19:03] but man won't accept God's remedy right
[19:07] won't accept his word on it
[19:11] Jesus has said
[19:13] this
[19:15] and this
[19:16] reminds us of his words knowing that he
[19:19] said heavens and earth will fail pass
[19:21] away but mine won't
[19:26] the question the true answer that Jesus
[19:29] wants to go back to is to go back to the
[19:33] beginning
[19:34] then that would be in Genesis calls the
[19:37] word Genesis is the seed chapter the
[19:40] every question in the Bible
[19:42] and you always have to go back to the
[19:44] seed to see what kind of a seeds in a
[19:47] field to find out what your crops will
[19:49] be
[19:50] now what kind of seed is sowing Genesis
[19:54] being the seed chapter we go back to
[19:56] Genesis Jesus
[19:58] introduce this to that scripture at the
[20:02] beginning
[20:03] now remember that's when time started to
[20:07] begin
[20:08] before that it was eternity
[20:12] now our question there was notice if we
[20:15] go back to the beginning
[20:18] now don't fail this
[20:22] that's reason I want to talk slow
[20:24] so that the people out on the wires
[20:28] and that the tape will say it clearly
[20:32] if Jesus said go back to the beginning
[20:36] there was only one pair of anything on
[20:40] Earth
[20:43] there was one atom one Eve
[20:48] they were joined by God Alone
[20:54] one female horse one male
[20:58] one female parrot one male
[21:02] at the beginning as he told us to go
[21:06] back there was only one pair of anything
[21:12] is that true
[21:18] then we find out that everything in the
[21:22] beginning was running in perfect order
[21:24] and harmony with God
[21:27] nothing was out of cater
[21:31] everything in heaven is still in order
[21:33] all the stars the galaxies the solar
[21:37] system everything is perfectly in order
[21:39] one of a move would interrupt the whole
[21:40] program
[21:43] now listen
[21:46] do you see one interruption
[21:50] spoils the entire program
[21:55] now when human beings was running in
[21:59] continuity with god with one man and one
[22:02] woman this woman sinned
[22:06] and it showed the whole Earthly program
[22:09] out of continuity with God
[22:13] therefore one word
[22:15] added to this book are one word taken
[22:19] from it throws a Christian out of
[22:20] continuity with God
[22:22] those are church out of continuity with
[22:25] God
[22:27] those of family out of continuity with
[22:29] God
[22:31] every believer can be thrown out
[22:35] by not accepting every word of God
[22:41] then he was the woman that caused the
[22:45] separation of the lovely home
[22:48] it was not a cherubim
[22:51] that bothered the Earth
[22:53] it was not Adam
[22:55] that showed the home out
[22:59] it was not
[23:01] anything else
[23:03] that drove the home out and thrown the
[23:06] whole thing out of cotton Lee but
[23:09] a woman
[23:13] um
[23:15] and it is here that the beginning that
[23:19] Jesus spoke of was broken
[23:25] Jesus said
[23:27] at the beginning
[23:29] God made one male one female
[23:34] of each kind
[23:37] and now when this woman
[23:41] not the female horse
[23:44] not the female dog
[23:47] but the woman
[23:51] she broke the entire continuity of God's
[23:55] operation on the earth and told
[23:57] everything into death
[24:01] the woman
[24:02] not the man
[24:04] she broke the Covenant
[24:07] she broke the Covenant because why
[24:10] she stepped across the borders of God's
[24:13] word
[24:19] now if she broke her Covenant with her
[24:22] husband
[24:23] she broke her Covenant with God
[24:26] then because she broke the Covenant of
[24:28] God she broke it with her husband
[24:30] and when you break your promise and your
[24:33] Covenant to God's word
[24:36] that's what caused so many illegitimate
[24:38] church members
[24:41] cause a group of man
[24:43] got together
[24:45] and said well it didn't mean that
[24:47] and it throws the whole organization out
[24:50] of continuity with the word
[24:52] uh we don't believe that Dr Jones said
[24:54] it wasn't so but as long as God said it
[24:57] so he said let every man's word be a lie
[25:00] and mine be the truth
[25:03] there breaks the continuity
[25:05] now
[25:07] we see being that the continuity is
[25:10] broken then the lifeline was broken
[25:14] also the timeline was broken
[25:19] the Covenant was broken
[25:22] everything shattered
[25:26] what caused it
[25:29] a woman
[25:34] that's what broke the Covenant now if
[25:36] you want to read that
[25:37] you can read it Genesis 3. now it was
[25:41] then
[25:45] man was made to rule over the woman by
[25:49] God's word she was no more co-equal with
[25:53] him
[25:55] she was co-equal in nature you know
[25:58] but when she broke God's word
[26:02] God made a man to be a ruler over her
[26:07] Genesis 3 16. if you want to put it down
[26:11] she was no more equal with the man
[26:15] she was a breaker of God's word don't
[26:17] you see she she the church down here
[26:21] the breaker of God's word that sold her
[26:24] completely out of continuity and that's
[26:26] what the church has done and thrown
[26:28] spiritual death upon the whole thing
[26:31] now you'll understand why Hammer these
[26:33] things like I do
[26:35] truth
[26:39] this is Bible facts
[26:43] notice
[26:47] why does she do such a thing as this
[26:50] how could that lovely beautiful
[26:53] perfect woman
[26:56] I've seen a picture one time I believe
[26:59] it was in Greece of an artist that
[27:01] painted a picture of Eve she's the most
[27:03] hard-looking thing I've ever seen
[27:05] that shows what a carnal mind can look
[27:07] at
[27:08] but she wasn't she was beautiful
[27:11] oh she's perfect
[27:13] woman or woman
