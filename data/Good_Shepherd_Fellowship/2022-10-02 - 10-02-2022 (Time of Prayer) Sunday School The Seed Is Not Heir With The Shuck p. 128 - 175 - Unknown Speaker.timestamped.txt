[0:01] foreign
[0:02] [Music]
[0:20] [Laughter]
[0:22] [Music]
[0:34] foreign
[0:43] no more prayer meetings no more agonized
[0:46] with God to fulfill his word no more
[0:48] believing that the word is still the
[0:50] same yesterday today and forever they
[0:52] just vulture eyes down got into
[0:54] denomination put their name on the book
[0:55] got lazy so it suspect our goat known
[0:58] some kind of a dead or Karen
[1:01] and that's supposed to be at least a
[1:03] hawk that's a similar brother to the
[1:05] eagle the prophet that brought the true
[1:07] word and manifested it relies on Hape
[1:10] rotten man-made theology
[1:14] where did you get it at and some
[1:16] man-made Sunday school program sheep
[1:20] some educator killed foreign back in
[1:23] some Seminary
[1:24] tell him that the days of Miracles has
[1:26] passed well no such a thing as a Baptist
[1:28] the Holy Ghost oh this is nonsense you
[1:31] need to tell me that an eagle would eat
[1:32] that he couldn't do it no sir neither
[1:35] will that Christian eat on the dead
[1:36] occurrence for the whole denominational
[1:38] doctrines and things they want the word
[1:40] of God's trust the promise of the hour
[1:44] God promised rabbits in the days of
[1:46] Luther
[1:48] he promised other things in the days of
[1:51] others but now he promised us a full
[1:53] Square meal the full
[1:56] seven course menu for all the Seven
[1:59] Seals are open and everything is ready
[2:01] for the word of God
[2:06] [Music]
[2:08] hulks hopping like buzzers nobleman
[2:12] think of it how critical how the hour is
[2:16] this is a Hulk has long lost his
[2:19] identification as a whole so as a church
[2:21] long lost her identification as a lesser
[2:26] bird brother of the eagle God's prophets
[2:30] once the carrier of a true word
[2:33] justification then it become a carrier
[2:35] of sanctification they become a carrier
[2:37] of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:39] restoration of the gifts but then when
[2:41] he goes on to keep going back try to eat
[2:43] something mannered from another day it's
[2:45] rotten it's no good a genuine Eagle of
[2:48] this day knows that was all right but we
[2:50] got that plus
[2:51] until Jesus Christ has made manifest in
[2:54] the fullness of his power as he promised
[2:56] to be in this last day she is now a dry
[2:59] shelter it's past the spirit of God
[3:03] pasture is true and will not she will
[3:07] not be heir
[3:09] with the Vindicated seed word she sure
[3:11] will not be shall not be in the Rapture
[3:13] she'll be a church member it may come up
[3:15] in the second Resurrection be judged
[3:17] according to what she's heard if you're
[3:19] here tonight just a church member what's
[3:21] your judgment going to be when we all
[3:22] have to stand there and witness you
[3:23] heard the truth
[3:25] she no more applies Into the Blue into
[3:27] the unknown unto the supernatural where
[3:30] the powers and Heights and the promises
[3:33] of God's Eternal Word is made possible
[3:35] all things to them that believe she
[3:37] won't believe that she said she falls
[3:39] right back on the telephone wire and
[3:41] says my denomination says the rabbit
[3:43] says all right
[3:46] though they got maggots in him but yet
[3:48] they're all right see
[3:50] she depends on that Pentecost is like
[3:53] her denominational vulture sister
[3:55] sitting now in large Council seats now
[3:59] the ungodly certainly
[4:02] listening to her worldly politic head
[4:05] feeding her old vulture food of Dead
[4:07] Rabbits of something that passed by 50
[4:09] years ago that's the condition of the
[4:11] Pentecostal Church oh my Justice Sarah
[4:15] tried to bring the promise of the
[4:16] supernatural by by hand-picked Hager
[4:20] so as a church trying to bring a Revival
[4:23] our great advantages across the country
[4:25] today A revive in our time or revive in
[4:27] our time all you Methodist Baptist
[4:29] Pentecostals all get together how can
[4:31] you have a Revival of fresh Manna on an
[4:34] old dead vulture how can you have it
[4:37] revived in our time the Revival will be
[4:40] so small that everyone ever happened
[4:41] Pentecostal said oh there's going to be
[4:43] a great thing happening it's happening
[4:45] and they don't know it yeah that's it
[4:47] yes sir for where the carcass is they're
[4:50] the Eagles will begin
[4:57] Christ Christ in you the same yesterday
[4:59] today and forever how true it is Sarah
[5:02] trying to get the promises all fulfilled
[5:04] you see in a great like the church
[5:06] they'd agree every Bible in our time by
[5:09] what about a perverted promise how you
[5:13] go to do it when God never did bless our
[5:14] organization he never did use an
[5:16] organization when a message went forth
[5:18] and they organized it died right there I
[5:20] challenge any historian to show me where
[5:22] it ever Rings again
[5:23] it died right there and stayed right
[5:25] there
[5:26] God just moved right on out of that
[5:28] carrier into another one right on how
[5:29] the Lutheran into the Methodist rolling
[5:31] out of the methodists into the
[5:31] Pentecostals now he's moved right out of
[5:33] the Pentecostals into the sea because it
[5:35] has to be the seat you can't beat nature
[5:38] there's no nothing else there for it to
[5:39] happen but the seed
[5:41] so the seafood produce itself he's the
[5:43] same yesterday today forever the same
[5:45] Pillar of Fire showing the same signs
[5:46] the same power the same God the same
[5:48] Miracles the same thing Vindicated the
[5:51] word in the Bible just exactly he's the
[5:53] same yesterday day and forever he's
[5:55] leading tonight God help us to see it
[5:57] believe it sure
[6:00] see Sarah the church hand pick Hagar it
[6:04] didn't work did it no her hand-picked
[6:07] group won't work today either doctors
[6:09] and phds and llds don't do it all the
[6:12] carriers fail Luther failed us Hager did
[6:15] what did Hager do Hager gave her son
[6:18] to another woman's bosom
[6:22] all right
[6:24] to raise her child
[6:26] Hagar did that
[6:27] gave her son her only son
[6:31] to another woman's bosom not his mother
[6:35] to raise it that's the same thing Luther
[6:37] did when he gave his son justification
[6:40] over to a denomination of who is exactly
[6:43] to raise him up
[6:45] Wesley failed the same way as Sarah did
[6:48] doubting his Supernatural birth being
[6:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost as Sarah
[6:53] did at the oak tree
[6:55] when Wesley was introduced to the
[6:56] supernatural when the Pentecostal Age
[6:58] come on and Wesley was introduced to
[7:00] speaking in tugs all this a liked and
[7:02] made fun of it all you Church of Christ
[7:04] and you so-called and you Baptists and
[7:06] Presbyterians every one of you turned
[7:08] your nose up on it and went away from it
[7:11] right what'd you do Wesley you Soldier
[7:15] child
[7:16] again to an organization
[7:18] and it died and perished it's exactly
[7:21] right but the word the true word went
[7:23] right on it didn't stay in that
[7:24] organization it moved right on
[7:25] independecost and took some more with
[7:27] his a more matured son like the sea that
[7:29] fell into the womb and that's why I
[7:31] started in the backbone they have lungs
[7:33] and head and feet and age while it come
[7:35] to a place that it was born that's right
[7:37] so that's how the church has matured the
[7:39] same way Wesley doubted just exactly
[7:42] like Sarah did the tree she said when
[7:44] the angel of the Lord a man dressed like
[7:46] a angel God it was himself Elohim
[7:49] dressed like a man stood there with dust
[7:52] on his clothes and said that he had give
[7:53] the promise after Sarah was 90 years old
[7:56] and Abraham a hundred
[7:58] and Sarah laughed up her sleeve and said
[8:00] how could this be when Abraham and I
[8:02] haven't had well we haven't been as
[8:05] young people family relationship maybe
[8:06] for 20 years she's nearly 100 years old
[8:08] so me have pleasure at my Lord me old
[8:10] and him the old too and his stream of
[8:12] life is dead and my wombs dried up my
[8:14] breast is gone the milk veins are gone
[8:16] how could I have it
[8:18] if God said I promise it
[8:24] so did Wesley
[8:26] how can we accept them speaking in
[8:28] tongues and Divine Healing and stuff
[8:29] it's not for us in this day God said our
[8:33] promised him the last days I'll pour out
[8:35] my spirit upon all pleasure he promised
[8:37] to do it and he went on and done it
[8:40] anyhow amen and the Wesleyan Church with
[8:43] all of its little pollen sisters of
[8:45] Baptist Presbyterians and Church of
[8:47] Christ nazarene's Pilgrim Holiness and
[8:49] United Brethren and what for died right
[8:51] with it and the church moved on now what
[8:54] did Pentecost do organizes it's like the
[8:56] ship it done the same thing it organized
[8:59] itself together set itself in as a
[9:01] shuffle
[9:02] that's right Pentecost was as Mary
[9:06] Pentecostal Feast look what Mary did
[9:08] what did Mary do wrong at a Pentecostal
[9:11] Feast one time she was faced with a
[9:13] bunch of dignitaries priests when her
[9:16] son she couldn't find him anywhere and
[9:18] she went back three days journey she'd
[9:20] left him like the modern church today
[9:23] about three times five or 25 as a church
[9:26] left
[9:27] about 50 years ago or 75. no left him at
[9:31] the Pentecostal Feast Mary went back up
[9:33] with Joseph three days looking for him
[9:35] she'd been looking for him couldn't find
[9:36] she found him what did she find she
[9:39] found him in the temple discussing the
[9:41] word of God with the priest and right in
[9:44] the front of those priests
[9:46] those dignified Mary left the curtain
[9:49] drop
[9:50] she did exactly the things she should
[9:52] not have done call her God the mother of
[9:55] God a mother ought to have more wisdom
[9:57] in her son
[9:58] and she said your father and I have
[10:01] sought you with tears for day and night
[10:05] your father and I claiming that the
[10:08] birth wasn't Supernatural that Joseph
[10:10] was the father of Jesus
[10:12] she denied the supernatural birth
[10:16] Pentecost stop speaking in tongues
[10:18] they denied the birth of the word
[10:21] yes it's exactly what it did he'll take
[10:22] so much of it but we'll take the rest of
[10:24] it it denied the birth of the word just
[10:26] like Mary did but watch
[10:28] there will not be any more organizations
[10:31] after this
[10:32] what's the word itself you're 12 years
[10:34] old
[10:35] just a little bitty thing back in the
[10:37] shop amen he said don't you know I must
[10:40] be about my father's business
[10:43] [Music]
[10:45] the word corrected the church right
[10:48] there
[10:49] what are you doing all these things for
[10:50] you know you can't do this we'll close
[10:52] up our doors we won't let you come in
[10:53] before we know you not that I must be
[10:54] about my father's business
[10:57] sir sir
[11:00] true Supernatural charm she just claimed
[11:03] to be Joseph's son a mere man or what
[11:06] Pentecost did this claim to be one of
[11:09] three
[11:10] [Music]
[11:11] I know it hurt
[11:13] one of three but he was all three in
[11:16] line
[11:16] [Applause]
[11:18] Pentacles oh yes he is the son of the
[11:21] father of the Holy Ghost being oh my
[11:24] God but the real true word speaks right
[11:26] out and said there are not three of them
[11:27] there's one of them
[11:30] you're not the word of God
[11:32] notice
[11:35] there will be no more carrier mother
[11:38] churches denominations after this
[11:40] carrier shook because ain't the shut
[11:42] there's no more nothing less than
[11:44] they'll be just the green is that right
[11:45] it's got to be the green it's got to be
[11:47] the same kind it went into the ground
[11:48] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[11:50] and forever a Spirit come up on the
[11:52] bride to do the same things that he did
[11:54] see it's a reproducing again of the
[11:57] grain
[11:58] the word yet young speak for itself and
[12:02] no not that I must be about my father's
[12:04] business
[12:05] there's the secret of the message now
[12:08] just exactly the father's business what
[12:11] is a father's business because you think
[12:13] I want the father's business was in him
[12:15] to fulfill what Isaiah said a virgin
[12:17] shall conceive fulfill what Isaiah said
[12:19] again the lame shall leap like a heart
[12:21] and all these things that take place
[12:23] like Moses said the Lord your God shall
[12:25] raise up a prophet among your lives and
[12:27] I mean it was the father's business to
[12:28] fulfill that word
[12:30] well if that come down to them stalks of
[12:33] them Natural Women what about these
[12:34] stalks of these Spiritual Church women
[12:37] churches means women women means
[12:39] churches rather is that right amen then
[12:42] what is it now we must be about the
[12:44] father's business the wheat would cry
[12:46] back the grain yes sir what was to do
[12:48] vindicate
[12:50] Malachi 4.
[12:52] indicate Luke 17 30 vindicate Hebrews 13
[12:56] 8 vindicate Saint John 14 12. vindicate
[13:00] all of his word vindicate Hebrews I mean
[13:03] Revelations the 10th chapter of the
[13:05] opening of The Seven Seals and the
[13:07] mysteries of God even to serpent seed
[13:09] and old will be manifested marriage and
[13:11] divorce and all these other Mysteries
[13:12] has been hit are the pillars from all
[13:14] these years from the theologians and so
[13:16] forth yeah they are that's the father's
[13:19] business I think they would receive it
[13:21] they want to be dignified say our
[13:23] denominational teaches that but the
[13:24] Bible does but God vindicates it to be
[13:27] true
[13:28] it is fulfilling this age from the Seven
[13:31] Seals
[13:32] or just proven the denominations have
[13:35] just been carriers that's another one of
[13:36] the father's business the proof now
[13:38] father's business now is to show you
[13:40] them denominations is not his
[13:42] they're a man-made systems that deny the
[13:45] word
[13:46] right
[13:47] notice you say well Mary the very great
[13:49] virgin at the cross he never called her
[13:52] mother he called her woman
[13:55] carrier not mother
[13:59] true she was a carrier of the word but
[14:02] she was not the word he was the word
[14:06] oh yes notice also she was not
[14:09] identified in the resurrection with him
[14:12] he died rose again because he was the
[14:14] word he was just a character
[14:17] she died and still in the grave that's
[14:20] right so she was at the carrier not his
[14:22] mother not God she was just a carrier
[14:24] like the churches are that's right so
[14:27] she was just a carer not the word let's
[14:29] close the saying this old Pentecostal
[14:32] Hawks
[14:34] hopping around like vultures
[14:40] partaking of the world just like the
[14:43] rest of them does
[14:45] having a form of godliness
[14:48] enough to deceive the very elected if
[14:50] possible
[14:52] but denying the power thereof it says
[14:54] the prophet here
[14:55] a perfect example of what God's word
[14:58] said it would be in the last days a lady
[15:00] you'll see a church age
[15:02] naked
[15:04] blind miserable
[15:07] poor wretched
[15:09] and don't know it
[15:11] tie a minute she's big and Wealthy has
[15:14] need of nothing and don't know that
[15:16] she's changed from a Hulk a similar
[15:19] brother to a prophet to keep the word of
[15:21] God straight she's turned to a vulture
[15:24] and feeding her people on dead
[15:26] ecclesiastical rabbits
[15:30] wake up
[15:34] how do you expect to be identified are
[15:37] heirs with the Eagles
[15:38] [Music]
[15:40] when such things as that in this great
[15:42] hour when the Rapture is at hand oh
[15:46] Christian

[15:49] if you've been a partial believer
[15:52] keep on attending the meetings for just
[15:53] a little while will you we got something

[16:00] to close and maybe finish tomorrow night
[16:02] well look let us bow our heads just a
[16:04] moment

[16:18] imagine what it said
[16:19] it's plain enough you could understand
[16:21] it I'm sure if you desire to
[16:24] if you're here tonight
[16:26] and you're without this experience I
[16:28] don't say you say I've danced in the
[16:30] spirit jumped all around yeah Hawks do
[16:33] the same things like the crows and the
[16:36] vultures
[16:37] I'm not asking that what are you eating
[16:39] at home where do you get your daily diet
[16:42] what are you feeding from the word of
[16:44] God or some oh a Karen that's been used
[16:47] back on her years and years ago has your
[16:50] experience even tonight was something
[16:51] that you've picked up many years ago or
[16:53] is it fresh and new tonight new manner
[16:55] that just fell from heaven and you're
[16:57] feeding your soul on looking tomorrow
[16:58] for something good and better
[17:01] if you're not that way now with your
[17:03] head spout your eyes closed and your
[17:05] hearts bound ask yourself this sincere
[17:07] question and not to me but to God would
[17:10] you raise your hand in a testimony of
[17:12] saying this God condition my soul and my
[17:15] spirit that I can feed only on the word
[17:17] of God would you just raise your hand
[17:19] say God bless you God bless you
[17:23] I don't know just exactly how many is in
[17:25] here is tonight I'm a very poor judge of
[17:28] crown but I'd say at least a third or
[17:30] more raise our hands that they won't
[17:33] condition solos
[17:35] let us remember in prayer now as we bow
[17:38] our heads Dear God
[17:40] I'm only responsible for saying the word
[17:45] and by these little simple Parables
[17:47] little types that people see that one's
[17:51] not going to be Heir with the other and
[17:53] we know that in the last days there's
[17:54] going to be people that's going to be
[17:56] raptured up into the heavens and some of
[18:00] them will be here when Jesus comes and
[18:02] we're looking for him to come even
[18:04] tonight and I'm thinking of 30 about 30
[18:07] or 33 years ago knelt here maybe this
[18:11] time of night long 9 30 or 10 o'clock
[18:14] praying for a father that was lost
[18:18] tonight Lord I'm praying for many
[18:20] fathers
[18:21] many mothers and brothers and sisters
[18:25] won't you have mercy Dear God
[18:28] it's too late now for my father to do
[18:30] anything about it he's passed beyond the
[18:32] boundaries
[18:33] of this life
[18:35] and soon Lord we are all going to pass
[18:37] that way
[18:39] I too must go that way every man and
[18:41] woman boy or girl in here has to go that
[18:43] way
[18:44] and we will be accountable for what we
[18:48] do with the word of God
[18:50] how little did that man seem in the
[18:54] sight of David when he was spitting upon
[18:56] him how little will those people think
[18:59] this spit up on Jesus the word
[19:02] when he returns again those that pierced
[19:04] him how little will the people feel who
[19:07] could walk away from here and see even
[19:08] even not only in some great Greek words
[19:12] and so forth but in plain nature that
[19:15] teaches us God the Creator can see the
[19:18] carriers of the word and see the word
[19:21] itself and know the hour We're living
[19:22] and harvest time is here dear God let us
[19:26] not turn our back up on it for some
[19:28] Folly of the world but let us tonight
[19:30] receiving with all of our heart Lord
[19:32] created me a good spirit the spirit of
[19:36] life that I might believe all thy words
[19:38] and accept Jesus the word the same
[19:41] yesterday today and forever and believe
[19:43] today on the potion it slaughtered to
[19:45] this age granted Lord I asked it in
[19:48] Jesus name
[19:49] now I'm going to ask each one of you as
[19:52] you're here and thinking of this real
[19:54] sincerely
[19:55] we don't have a church for you John
[19:58] we have a pool down there to be baptized
[20:00] in
[20:01] as many as believe was baptized if
[20:04] you've never been baptized yet by
[20:05] Christian baptism that don't mean
[20:07] sprinkling pouring that means by
[20:09] immersing not in a title of father-son
[20:12] Holy Ghost but in the name of Jesus
