[41:23] well when she told me that I went and uh
[41:27] did some Google search on it since I'm
[41:30] not a physician
[41:32] and uh and the the search I did was
[41:36] something that could be inherited
[41:38] genetically but also Medical Science
[41:41] does not have a direct
[41:44] treatment for it
[41:46] they don't have a direct treatment to
[41:48] bring healing they believe that a person
[41:52] can live with faith and until their time
[41:55] is off on on this phase of the Earth but
[41:58] we believe in the gods that do heal the
[42:01] sick amen a girl that can that can

[53:00] had a good time you know we had a good
[53:02] time and talking but there was just
[53:05] something that kind of her uh struck me
[53:08] a little bit
[53:22] okay young people you have your meeting
[53:25] after after service uh today
[53:29] so uh
[53:30] if we don't forgive we announce it when
[53:32] we come to the end of the service
[53:35] and so uh
[53:41] but then there was something that kind
[53:43] of caught my attention a little bit
[53:46] and what actually it was was the other
[53:52] I think uh
[53:56] sometimes
[54:00] all through the week I was thinking
[54:02] about it and it's actually brought me to
[54:04] a place where uh I was standing on the
[54:09] subject to preach
[54:11] and uh and I really found find the China
[54:14] to be able to enter in it and what
[54:17] actually it was is that I've been
[54:19] thinking about dealing with shame
[54:21] speaking on dealing with shame that's
[54:23] not what I'm going to speak on this
[54:25] morning but uh that was what was on my
[54:28] mind was from what I saw
[54:30] and uh
[54:32] many times
[54:34] uh when we have to deal with a loved one
[54:38] that is now well whether it's a child
[54:40] it's a house one is is a sibling or
[54:45] whatever it is
[54:46] that uh not so easy we don't come to
[54:50] term we're dealing with that so easily
[54:52] but as I was thinking about it and I I
[54:56] got to thinking also how uh even as a
[55:01] church we uh we uh we are blessed
[55:05] because we have a big group of uh of of
[55:09] some of the brothers and sisters here
[55:11] that work in uh in in some of the
[55:14] facilities group home and and
[55:17] nursing homes and and all of that
[55:21] and uh
[55:22] in as much as it is a blessing
[55:27] if we don't know how to deal with faith
[55:29] and how to uh identify is it is it is
[55:34] not just a job for a paycheck
[55:38] but I also believe that uh it's uh is is
[55:42] uh it's a place it's a place of calling
[55:45] where you know God can place a Son of
[55:49] God and a daughter of God for us to be
[55:53] blessing to those people
[55:56] praise the Lord
[55:58] ain't as much it's a job where the uh
[56:03] you know we go in and out but we have to
[56:06] realize we are dealing with people that
[56:09] are now well and uh and we and we want
[56:12] to be in the right mindset we want to be
[56:15] you know also prayerful you know uh uh
[56:20] and and many of the times uh we don't
[56:22] realize how much our present our
[56:25] presence is a blessing to those people
[56:27] you know when when you a Son of God the
[56:31] way you order your life you keep your
[56:32] life under the atmosphere of God's word
[56:35] you go to you go to work to go and help
[56:38] people you know uh uh have a good day in
[56:42] their homes or in their caregiving area
[56:45] is such a blessing
[56:47] and it's always good to be in the right
[56:49] mind amen for us to be in the right
[56:52] mindset and also in the right spirit
[56:54] because uh uh uh
[57:00] imagine in many ways
[57:02] people don't know how to deal with uh
[57:05] with shame
[57:07] praise the Lord
[57:10] many times is is there with by either
[57:13] hiding
[57:15] away from it
[57:16] you know uh or uh
[57:22] choosing a complete different
[57:23] personality
[57:25] praise the Lord they take a complete
[57:28] different personality because they just
[57:31] don't want to deal with that
[57:34] but I pray that the Lord will will be
[57:36] able to to give us Grace because you
[57:39] will realize Jesus said
[57:42] is only him that is nashik
[57:46] that don't need a physician
[57:49] praise the Lord
[57:50] if every one of us here this morning can
[57:53] say we need a great physician
[57:55] then we must all accept that we all have
[57:59] a special need
[58:01] s your special need might not be my
[58:04] special name
[58:05] praise the Lord
[58:07] I have a special need
[58:09] and I will ask that you pray for me my
[58:12] specialty one of my special needs I have
[58:15] a heading cross eye
[58:18] that
[58:20] many times
[58:22] I'm looking
[58:24] and I'm not even looking at you but it
[58:27] appears so bad
[58:29] that people think what in the world what
[58:33] is he looking at me like that
[58:35] and actually I'm not looking at you
[58:38] I might be facing your direction but my
[58:41] mind is completely somewhere else
[58:44] many times people have told me about
[58:46] that man you got an ugly look
[58:50] why are you looking like that and it's I
[58:54] mean truly my mind is gone I'm thinking
[58:56] about something yes I remember the first
[58:58] time I went to to the Ivory Coast many
[59:01] years back 1994.
[59:04] and then uh the uh I traveled down to
[59:07] abhijan and there was a there was a
[59:10] family there we were we were dead and uh
[59:12] uh actually this brother was working on
[59:15] the refugee camp and he left the the
[59:18] Saints there they didn't know where he
[59:20] was he was not coming back and I was
[59:22] moving in the area so I needed to talk
[59:24] to him so I went there and and we were
[59:26] visiting and then after
[59:29] after a month or so when when uh when uh
[59:35] when when his wife father family was
[59:37] settled down with us it was another
[59:39] brother myself you know settled down
[59:41] with us then she called me
[59:44] she said she says son let me confess to
[59:47] you
[59:48] he said
[59:51] you know
[59:53] I don't know I I don't think it was you
[59:55] I think it was me because I will always
[59:58] think am I dressing wrong
[1:00:02] why is he looking at me like that
[1:00:04] and then I would go out look at myself
[1:00:06] in the mirror
[1:00:08] I said there was nothing wrong with me
[1:00:10] and definitely I was thinking about
[1:00:13] the church I left in a wall area
[1:00:17] I was worried what is going on with
[1:00:19] those people and yeah this woman
[1:00:21] thinking that I'm I'm criticizing her
[1:00:23] with so that's my special need
[1:00:26] I have a terrible cross eye
[1:00:30] so the day you find me looking at you
[1:00:32] and you are not okay with it just say
[1:00:34] that his eyes is crossed
[1:00:39] but we we all have a special name
[1:00:42] praise the Lord and you see and and and
[1:00:45] and and and some of these Special Needs
[1:00:47] there are some that we are not proud of
[1:00:52] there are some that we don't want
[1:00:54] anybody to know of
[1:00:58] but we know it's a need
[1:01:03] we know it's a need
[1:01:05] praise the Lord now
[1:01:08] realizing that we all have a special
[1:01:12] need
[1:01:13] it create this room of comfort
[1:01:17] for us to be able to accommodate
[1:01:20] others that have special needs
[1:01:26] not only for money
[1:01:31] but to realize
[1:01:33] that
[1:01:36] from the day
[1:01:38] our parents Aaron and Eve
[1:01:41] fare from
[1:01:44] Grace
[1:01:45] he put the word to the place word out of
[1:01:48] their children that we are
[1:01:50] a bone with special needs
[1:01:53] for the fact that we are born in this
[1:01:55] world coming to the word speaking lies
[1:01:58] we all have a special need
[1:02:01] if God bless us we will preach that
[1:02:04] message on a special need
[1:02:07] a brother uh uh I brought a little
[1:02:09] concern to me now from uh from the the
[1:02:13] speaker last week and just like I said
[1:02:16] Wednesday night you know uh we
[1:02:20] appreciate our brother Ariel uh you know
[1:02:24] translating for us and
[1:02:27] which of course I thought that was that
[1:02:30] was beautiful there were some there were
[1:02:32] some things a line of thoughts that the
[1:02:34] brother expressed one of them he was
[1:02:36] talking about uh he was coming with the
[1:02:39] top the other uh
[1:02:45] it is not because we uh we are in a
[1:02:49] message that we are the bride
[1:02:53] so he expressed the thought there there
[1:02:55] are foolish virgin here
[1:02:58] okay he said that you know they are
[1:03:01] foolish virgin here man so it is all it
[1:03:04] is coming from the top it is not from
[1:03:06] the top because we know that the message
[1:03:08] is sent to call other people for his
[1:03:12] namesake and the people for his name
[1:03:14] said is the bride
[1:03:16] praise the Lord so the purpose of the
[1:03:19] message is to call out a brine
[1:03:22] praise the Lord amen but when the
[1:03:25] preacher expressed things that way it is
[1:03:29] it is we cannot we cannot commentate
[1:03:31] that in a sense that we know that in
[1:03:34] every Gathering they have three kinds of
[1:03:36] people and the three kinds of people is
[1:03:38] not the bride right
[1:03:41] is now all of them debride
[1:03:43] are we together amen
[1:03:46] so sometimes when the preacher expressed
[1:03:49] that he's not saying there is foolish
[1:03:52] virgin in the message all there is
[1:03:54] foolish virgin in the bride
[1:03:57] you you cannot mix those two
[1:04:01] the bride cannot be a foolish virgin
[1:04:03] there is wise virgin which is the bride
[1:04:06] and there is fully virgin yes
[1:04:09] praise the Lord amen so uh uh those kind
[1:04:13] of a statement I would take them in that
[1:04:15] light
[1:04:17] you know I would take them in their life
[1:04:19] that he's uh trying to uh encourage us
[1:04:23] to
[1:04:25] to just like the scripture we say come
[1:04:27] up higher
[1:04:29] praise the Lord
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:32] and he was also talking about how the
[1:04:35] blood speaks
[1:04:36] you know we're speaking about how the
[1:04:39] blood speaks and he says the blood of
[1:04:42] Abel was speaking for virgins
[1:04:46] he was crying out the blood cried the
[1:04:48] Bible says the blood of ABIA crowd
[1:04:51] against the blood I mean against King
[1:04:53] and and then he talks about how the
[1:04:56] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:58] speak for forgiveness
[1:05:01] and now in breaking his his uh his
[1:05:04] illustration to show us how the blood
[1:05:07] speaks he took he took America
[1:05:09] comparison that a man want to marry and
[1:05:13] he's of this blood type and the woman
[1:05:15] want to marry of this blood type that is
[1:05:18] not a doctrine that we believe
[1:05:22] okay is now the doctrine that we believe
[1:05:25] I don't believe it why because if we
[1:05:28] have a blood that speak better things
[1:05:32] if the blood of Jesus Christ speak
[1:05:34] better things
[1:05:36] praise the Lord then for us to come to
[1:05:39] the place where we would take in
[1:05:42] consideration our human blood for the
[1:05:44] examination before we can take somebody
[1:05:46] into the grace of God then we are
[1:05:49] trumping the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:05:52] lesser than our human blood
[1:05:57] so to me he
[1:05:59] an example
[1:06:02] praise the Lord he was not establishing
[1:06:04] a Doctrine
[1:06:06] it's two different things
[1:06:12] praise the Lord
[1:06:13] okay
[1:06:15] with that being said
[1:06:17] if there is more conversation
[1:06:20] we can talk about it later
[1:06:22] less than on our feet
[1:06:25] we'll turn to the Book of Ruth
[1:06:29] praise the Lord
[1:06:32] and uh
[1:06:38] you love the Lord
[1:06:47] brother brother last Lady insists of
[1:06:50] Vicky
[1:06:51] we are we are home folks here
[1:06:55] we have a habit that when we come here
[1:06:57] we start talking about the word of God
[1:06:59] we just get lost about time and and it
[1:07:03] seems like we stayed so long
[1:07:05] I will want to apologize to you before I
[1:07:08] start will you please be patient with me
[1:07:11] praise the Lord
[1:07:15] Ruth chapter four let's read in the in
[1:07:18] the Bible yeah root chapter 4.
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:24] praise the Lord
[1:07:26] I mean it's a blessing to have them
[1:07:28] to take up a time and come and visit
[1:07:31] with us
[1:07:32] praise the Lord
[1:07:39] Ruth chapter four now when you look in
[1:07:43] the Book of Ruth chapter four there is
[1:07:46] there is a there is a line of Prophecy
[1:07:48] that is lying in that
[1:07:50] and uh uh we just came through Easter
[1:07:55] and uh and a brother uh
[1:07:59] Mark Howard was preaching for us and he
[1:08:02] was talking about Redemption and all of
[1:08:04] there
[1:08:05] the book of a rule having one of the
[1:08:09] most beautiful and profound Redemptive
[1:08:11] storage
[1:08:13] I won't keep you long because we can I
[1:08:17] can I can run through this thing and
[1:08:20] then uh
[1:08:21] if the Lord bless it you might lose your
[1:08:24] appetite for food
[1:08:26] and just you know stay right here the

[1:08:37] to sit down and we will go back to the
[1:08:39] to to chapter verse one let's read verse
[1:08:42] 12.
[1:08:43] of Ruth chapter four
[1:08:52] verse 11 will be good to read and all
[1:08:55] the people that were at the gate this
[1:08:58] was at the wedding of Boaz and Ruth
[1:09:01] all the people
[1:09:04] are the gate and the others said we Are
[1:09:09] Witnesses
[1:09:11] the Lord make the woman that is come
[1:09:14] into the house
[1:09:16] like Rachel and like live

[1:09:22] which two did built the house of Israel
[1:09:24] and do thou worthily in Africa and be
[1:09:28] famous in Bethlehem
[1:09:31] praise the Lord
[1:09:33] and let the house
[1:09:35] be like
[1:09:37] the house of fears whom tear my bed unto
[1:09:41] Judah
[1:09:42] of the seed which the Lord
[1:09:46] shall I give thee of this young woman of
[1:09:50] the sea which the Lord shall give thee
[1:09:55] that sounds to me like genesis chapter 3
[1:09:58] 15 the seed of the woman
[1:10:00] of the sea which the Lord shall give
[1:10:04] thee
[1:10:07] praise the Lord
[1:10:10] of this young woman
[1:10:14] the Lord bless you you may have your
[1:10:16] seed
[1:10:18] we just did a reading year
[1:10:21] and I want to I want to I want to speak
[1:10:25] this morning on the house of pharaohs
[1:10:28] it's a prophecy
[1:10:31] it's a prophecy and I'm and I'm I'm
[1:10:33] trusting that the Lord will be able to
[1:10:36] to help us to be able to look into it uh
[1:10:41] this morning by the help of the Lord
[1:10:44] amen
[1:10:46] let's go back to verse one like I said
[1:10:48] we will try to read quickly when boys
[1:10:52] then went up to the gate and shut down
[1:10:55] boy sat down and behold the King's Men
[1:10:58] whom bought us uh of humble aspect came
[1:11:01] by unto whom he said oh such a one turn
[1:11:06] the sound sit down and he turned us out
[1:11:09] and he sit down and he sat down sorry
[1:11:11] and he took 10 men of the others
[1:11:16] of
[1:11:17] the city and said said yes sit year down
[1:11:22] year and they sat down now there is
[1:11:26] there is two places in the scripture
[1:11:28] where you where you see this there is
[1:11:30] another place but you don't you don't
[1:11:32] see it until you look for it
[1:11:36] and uh uh
[1:11:38] of the
[1:11:43] praise the Lord
[1:11:47] the other place where you will see this
[1:11:49] is actually over in the bulk of uh
[1:11:52] Genesis
[1:11:55] you will find that over in the Book of
[1:11:57] Genesis but let me let me give you the
[1:11:59] picture of what it is here
[1:12:01] this is uh is uh it's a tradition
[1:12:06] it was a tradition in the land of Israel
[1:12:10] the other uh
[1:12:16] whenever you have a a wedding ceremony
[1:12:20] like this you have 10 others
[1:12:23] and uh uh and and these 10 men will be
[1:12:27] there like witness so if you actually go
[1:12:30] back to the Book of Genesis which of
[1:12:32] course I would not want us to go back
[1:12:34] there I think I I spoke on that before
[1:12:37] you found out that
[1:12:39] even in Genesis chapter 24 the bible
[1:12:43] really never call out the name of of
[1:12:46] Abraham 7.
[1:12:48] we call him elieza
[1:12:51] and the reason why we call him Eleazar
[1:12:54] is because of Genesis chapter 15. but if
[1:12:57] you read Genesis chapter 24 his name is
[1:12:59] not mentioned why his name is not
[1:13:02] mentioned is because his honor a Divine
[1:13:05] commission he's acting like the Holy
[1:13:08] Spirit
[1:13:10] he's going out to search out a bride for
[1:13:13] the father
[1:13:15] praise the Lord
[1:13:17] so all of that mentioned he is the main
[1:13:20] character
[1:13:22] but if you if you follow the story and
[1:13:24] closely when you read you will realize
[1:13:27] that elieza went with camels
[1:13:31] that Rebecca gave those candles to drink
[1:13:35] praise the Lord
[1:13:37] but as you read the story from the
[1:13:39] beginning and and in a way that we have
[1:13:41] read it it always looked like it was Eli
[1:13:44] Isa a loan that was on that mission no
[1:13:48] read Genesis chapter 24 when you get
[1:13:50] whom you realize
[1:13:52] a win with men
[1:13:57] and as a Jewish custom that's what that
[1:14:00] you cannot have a proper Jewish wedding
[1:14:04] without the elders witnessing
[1:14:07] you have to have an end this this uh
[1:14:11] there's uh there's a Jewish name for it
[1:14:13] let me let me find it for you
[1:14:15] I have a year in one of my notes I was
[1:14:18] just speaking on that uh some time ago
[1:14:21] let me go to what I want to speak in and
[1:14:24] that's that's where I lost a lot of time
[1:14:27] but if if you read a scripture you would
[1:14:29] then you understand and and and and and
[1:14:31] and and also you see that's the reason
[1:14:34] why Broadband there in the in church age
[1:14:36] book he says I'm placing you to the same
[1:14:39] place he says I'm placing you ministers
[1:14:41] to the same place where I am you are
[1:14:43] also messenger of this message
[1:14:49] praise the Lord
[1:14:51] because God knew that there will be a
[1:14:54] faithful fight for Ministry that will
[1:14:56] come behind and being able to live the
[1:14:59] voice of Elijah before the people right
[1:15:07] right are we together
[1:15:10] now so that is the place of these 10 men
[1:15:12] let's go right there into the prophecy
[1:15:15] as we will go ahead and uh uh
[1:15:20] then the Bible goes here verse 3 and he
[1:15:24] said unto the king's man now Boaz is
[1:15:27] speaking to the man that was more closer
[1:15:29] to Naomi than him because there was a
[1:15:33] man that was more closer to Naomi
[1:15:37] than boys
[1:15:39] praise the Lord
[1:15:41] amen so Boaz is speaking now to that man
[1:15:44] he's saying uh
[1:15:52] into the kingsman now me that is come
[1:15:55] again out of the land of more
[1:15:59] of land which is of our brother amalek
[1:16:03] and he taught to advise these saying buy
[1:16:06] it
[1:16:07] before
[1:16:10] they inhabit things and before the
[1:16:12] errors of my people if thou will redeem
[1:16:14] it redeem it
[1:16:16] but if there will not redeem it then
[1:16:20] tell me that I may know
[1:16:22] for there is none to redeem it beside
[1:16:25] thee and I am after thee so he was next
[1:16:29] in line and he said I will redeem it the
[1:16:32] guy said he's going to redeem it praise
[1:16:35] the Lord
[1:16:36] amen
[1:16:38] damn boa says obey thou borrow the field
[1:16:43] of the hand of Naomi thou must buy it
[1:16:47] also of Ruth the moabite
[1:16:50] so you see this guy was a businessman
[1:16:54] he was not really a soul Seeker
[1:16:58] he wanted a field
[1:17:01] but he he never he was not uh he didn't
[1:17:06] care and never had no concern for what
[1:17:09] would become of now mean or her
[1:17:11] daughter-in-law Ruth
[1:17:13] as soon as Boba says if you buy the
[1:17:16] field you have to buy it of the hand of
[1:17:18] Naomi and also of of Ruth the more about
[1:17:22] he back up
[1:17:26] praise the Lord
[1:17:28] amen
[1:17:34] the kingsman said I cannot redeem it
[1:17:38] for myself least and my my own
[1:17:40] inheritance
[1:17:41] redeemed thou my right told thyself for
[1:17:45] I cannot redeem it now this was the man
[1:17:49] and informal time in Israel concerning
[1:17:52] redeeming and concerning changing for to
[1:17:56] confirm all things a man plug off his
[1:17:59] shoes and give it to his neighbor
[1:18:02] so the tradition was if you cannot
[1:18:05] redeem it you have to take off your
[1:18:07] shoes
[1:18:08] for your neighbor to step in it
[1:18:12] so you see when God came down and told
[1:18:15] Moses take off your shoes it was a
[1:18:18] Redemption language
[1:18:22] when he told Joshua take off your shoes
[1:18:26] it was a Redemption language
[1:18:30] and you and myself we have the same
[1:18:32] language when you tell somebody you are
[1:18:34] not in my shoes
[1:18:37] you are not you don't know what I'm
[1:18:39] going through because you are not in my
[1:18:41] shoes
[1:18:42] but I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:18:44] there is one
[1:18:45] that can fit every size
[1:18:48] I don't care what is your size what is
[1:18:51] your shoes whatever you're going to
[1:18:53] going through
[1:18:55] he can step in it it will be a neat fate
[1:19:00] praise the Lord
[1:19:03] are we together
[1:19:12] now this was the manner in uh in former
[1:19:15] time in Israel concerning redeeming and
[1:19:17] concerning changing
[1:19:19] to confirm all things a man flock of his
[1:19:23] shoes and give it to his neighbor
[1:19:25] and this was a testimony in Israel
[1:19:29] praise the Lord
[1:19:31] Hallelujah therefore the king's man said
[1:19:34] untoboard by eight of the so he drew off
[1:19:38] his shoes
[1:19:40] praise the Lord
[1:19:43] are we together
[1:19:46] and boy said on to the others
[1:19:50] and unto all the people
[1:19:52] ye are witnesses this day
[1:19:55] bought all that was emulate and all that
[1:20:00] was chelon and melon of the hang of
[1:20:03] Naomi moreover Ruth the mobile
[1:20:08] the wife of male on her purchased to be
[1:20:11] my wife to raise up a name of the Dead
[1:20:14] upon his inheritance
[1:20:17] that the name of the Dead being there
[1:20:19] cut off from M1
[1:20:22] his brethroughs
[1:20:24] and from the Gate of his place
[1:20:27] yeah our Witnesses this day
[1:20:30] and the people says we are all Witnesses
[1:20:33] amen and because you have done this
[1:20:37] the Lord make the woman
[1:20:40] that has come into the house
[1:20:44] like Rachel and Leah now think about it
[1:20:47] this is a moabite
[1:20:55] why are these people
[1:20:58] prophesying that she should be
[1:21:01] why they are saying they are saying they
[1:21:04] are let her be our mother
[1:21:09] because they are saying she should be
[1:21:11] like Rachel and Mia the mother of Israel
[1:21:17] the mother of the Patriot
[1:21:22] so we see there is something that is
[1:21:24] running very deep in this amen
[1:21:28] praise the Lord
[1:21:30] and also they said
[1:21:33] they never stop to
[1:21:36] Rachel and live
[1:21:38] they said
[1:21:39] and left the house
[1:21:42] be like the house of pharaohs
[1:21:45] now we have to find out
[1:21:48] this house of fears what is it all about
[1:21:52] are we together
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:56] now now to take a lot of your time
[1:21:59] pharaohs was one of the twins that was
[1:22:02] born onto Judah
[1:22:06] by an abominable art that he had with
[1:22:09] his daughter in law
[1:22:11] Genesis chapter 38.
[1:22:14] where Tema was not giving unto Judah
[1:22:17] younger son she disguised herself
[1:22:22] praise the Lord
[1:22:24] praise the Lord
[1:22:26] amen are you ready to get your hands
[1:22:29] Daddy
[1:22:32] are you ready
[1:22:36] praise the Lord
[1:22:40] when Judah when I gave his
[1:22:42] daughter-in-law
[1:22:45] to I mean his his younger son to his
[1:22:47] daughter-in-law tema she disguised
[1:22:50] herself because she wanted to she wanted
[1:22:53] the blessing
[1:22:55] she disguised herself
[1:22:57] and Judah took her to be a prostitute
[1:23:01] and he hired her for a wife and she got
[1:23:05] pregnant and she got these two boys
[1:23:10] and at the birth of these two boys
[1:23:14] praise the Lord
[1:23:22] are we together
[1:23:29] of the birth of these two boys
[1:23:33] the Bible says when the first
[1:23:39] which was Zera
[1:23:43] he held his hands out
[1:23:45] and the male wife pulled a red ribbon
[1:23:49] around his his hand
[1:23:50] but then fear us
[1:23:53] overcame him and became the first to be
[1:23:57] born
[1:24:02] praise the Lord
[1:24:03] amen
[1:24:05] I was I will I will say it again so you
[1:24:09] grab my thought
[1:24:13] at a time of birth
[1:24:17] thereof
[1:24:20] was the child that was suspected to be
[1:24:23] birthed first and the male wife was
[1:24:25] trying to get Tema in the in the right
[1:24:28] condition
[1:24:30] for her to bring forth
[1:24:32] her boys
[1:24:35] there are hands came out and uh and the
[1:24:38] male wife put a red ribbing around his
[1:24:40] hand
[1:24:42] praise the Lord trying to position him
[1:24:45] for birth
[1:24:47] pharaohs broke forth
[1:24:50] so the name him Pharaoh's meaning
[1:24:53] you brought forth
[1:24:56] amends you overcame
[1:25:00] praise the Lord
[1:25:03] are we together
[1:25:10] glory be to God
[1:25:13] amen
[1:25:20] Genesis chapter 38 verse 29 the Bible
[1:25:23] says and it came to pass as he drew back
[1:25:26] his hand that was Era
[1:25:29] behold his brother came out
[1:25:32] and she said how have that broken forth
[1:25:36] this bridge be upon thee therefore his
[1:25:40] name was called
[1:25:42] parents
[1:25:44] praise the Lord
[1:25:47] he broke forth
[1:25:49] he overcame
[1:25:51] now here is it now that the the women
[1:25:54] the others of Israel is telling
[1:25:58] boss and his wife that left your house
[1:26:02] be the house
[1:26:06] be like the house of pharaohs
[1:26:12] are we together
[1:26:18] let's let's read
[1:26:22] Deuteronomy chapter 22 23.
[1:26:27] Deuteronomy chapter 23.
[1:26:30] praise the Lord I'm just going to lay
[1:26:33] the foundation here
[1:26:35] because there is just so much here for
[1:26:37] us to enjoy this morning amen
[1:26:40] do you have an appetite for the word
[1:26:43] praise the Lord
[1:26:45] or you just want me to get get it from
[1:26:47] here
[1:26:50] so you can go about and enjoy your day
[1:26:53] don't worry
[1:26:56] Deuteronomy chapter 23 verse 2.
[1:27:00] the Bible says
[1:27:02] a bastard shall not enter into the
[1:27:05] congregation of the Lord
[1:27:07] even though his 10th Generation
[1:27:11] enter into the congregation of the Lord
[1:27:16] an ammonite or a more bite shall not
[1:27:20] enter into the congregation of the Lord
[1:27:22] even unto their 10th Generation shall
[1:27:25] they not enter so they were also
[1:27:27] classified as bastard now you see that
[1:27:31] that word which means an illegitimate
[1:27:34] charge that word in our language today
[1:27:38] is normally used in a sense when a child
[1:27:42] don't know their father but that's
[1:27:44] that's not the right meaning the word is
[1:27:47] actually used when uh when a child is
[1:27:52] born uh out of holy warlock right
[1:27:57] praise the Lord
[1:27:59] okay which means because uh you cannot
[1:28:03] tell me pharaohs knew that Jacob was his
[1:28:06] father
[1:28:09] and the more but I knew that their their
[1:28:12] their parents were from from lot
[1:28:16] praise the Lord
[1:28:18] okay so it is always used when uh
[1:28:22] because there was there was there was uh
[1:28:25] uh uh a proper approach to to marriage
[1:28:29] and all of that so when when that was
[1:28:32] not done in the Jewish uh uh sense
[1:28:35] that's how they look at that when the
[1:28:37] child was you know was uh I would
[1:28:39] imagine not married a woman you know a
[1:28:41] child that was born out of uh what
[1:28:43] whatever so that's that's the I just I
[1:28:46] just want to I just want to uh uh uh you
[1:28:51] will realize that uh the the Pharisees
[1:28:55] they they they call Jesus illegitimate
[1:28:59] because Mary and Joseph were not married
[1:29:02] yet even though they were exposed to be
[1:29:04] married they were espoused to be married
[1:29:06] but they were now married here for the
[1:29:08] fact that she's now saying she's
[1:29:11] pregnant
[1:29:13] and the wedding was not done
[1:29:16] praise the Lord even though they said
[1:29:19] Joseph is his father
[1:29:22] so in a sense Joseph slept with his wife
[1:29:25] before the wedding day
[1:29:28] so in that sense they would call the
[1:29:30] child illegitimate
[1:29:33] praise the Lord
[1:29:34] are we together
[1:29:36] now but yeah we we see a prophecy
[1:29:41] that is standing like a strong
[1:29:44] commitment of the law of the bastard
[1:29:46] shall not enter into the congregation of
[1:29:48] the Lord until the 10th Generation let's
[1:29:50] get back to the Book of Ruth
[1:29:53] let's discover that quickly because it's
[1:29:55] beautiful
[1:29:57] it is beautiful
[1:29:59] amen amen you love the Lord
[1:30:03] he's being so good to us
[1:30:06] the Lord being so good to us
[1:30:12] the Bible said
[1:30:17] well second to be prophesying to this
[1:30:19] man
[1:30:20] promising him there he says how should
[1:30:22] be like the house of richer and and and
[1:30:25] Leah the mother of Israel and also let
[1:30:28] his house be like the house of pharaohs
[1:30:30] see the kind of for other they are
[1:30:32] referring to but let's see why why they
[1:30:34] say that
[1:30:35] the Bible says verse 13 so boas took
[1:30:38] Ruth
[1:30:40] and she was his wife
[1:30:43] and he went on to her and the lord gave
[1:30:45] her
[1:30:46] conception and she beared a son
[1:30:49] and the women said
[1:30:52] unto Naomi and blessed be the Lord which
[1:30:56] have not left it this day without a
[1:30:58] casement
[1:31:01] that his name may be famous in Israel
[1:31:06] and he shall be unto thee
[1:31:10] he shall be the king's man shall be unto
[1:31:14] thee a restorer of thy life
[1:31:17] the King's Men shall be unto thee
[1:31:21] the nourisher of thine o h
[1:31:24] and Thy daughter-in-lawed Thy famous
[1:31:27] daughter-in-law
[1:31:29] Ruth the Bible says which loveth thee
[1:31:34] which is
[1:31:36] n't Church to be then seven sons
[1:31:41] praise the Lord
[1:31:43] amen
[1:31:44] now you think about it
[1:31:47] and you'll think about it this is a very
[1:31:50] very uh be prophecy you mean roof
[1:31:55] there's more body that has been redeemed
[1:31:58] this thing
[1:32:00] it's now going to stand in Israel
[1:32:04] better than seven sons
[1:32:07] what kind of a language is that
[1:32:11] praise the Lord
[1:32:12] why because the songs were the one in
[1:32:16] the law
[1:32:18] to take the inheritance of their father
[1:32:21] inheritance was only given to the
[1:32:23] daughters when the daughters of zephas
[1:32:26] two before Moses and said our father
[1:32:29] don't have no boy
[1:32:31] and we don't want his name to lie dead
[1:32:34] in Israel give us the inheritance of our
[1:32:37] father
[1:32:38] praise the Lord amen amen so now Moses
[1:32:42] have to write another Lord
[1:32:48] that if if a family don't have a boy
[1:32:51] then now The Inheritance can be given to
[1:32:54] the girl
[1:32:55] but she has to marry in that tribe
[1:32:58] so the inheritance can stay in the tribe
[1:33:02] are we together but Jerry said now these
[1:33:06] people that know the Commandment of
[1:33:08] Moses they are saying here that rules
[1:33:11] this more abide are being redeemed
[1:33:13] she's better
[1:33:16] seven sons
[1:33:18] do you see how in God's Redemption plan
[1:33:22] how he thinks about his bride he lived
[1:33:25] the bride higher than the messenger
[1:33:33] praise the Lord
[1:33:35] in God's mind
[1:33:38] he esteemed the people that have been
[1:33:41] called out by the message more than the
[1:33:44] messenger
[1:33:52] oh
[1:33:54] when it's becoming sweet it becomes
[1:33:57] selling I love it
[1:34:00] glory be to God
[1:34:05] that is better than seven
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:11] there was a bride that was called out
[1:34:13] right
[1:34:14] every age had a bride that was caught
[1:34:17] out
[1:34:19] praise the Lord
[1:34:21] the bride she is
[1:34:25] the reproduction of the message
[1:34:28] the message that was preached
[1:34:32] produces a people right
[1:34:35] praise the Lord
[1:34:36] amen
[1:34:38] that is the benefit of the messenger
[1:34:42] message yes
[1:34:46] we are
[1:34:47] trophic of his
[1:34:51] right around him saying you are the
[1:34:53] crowning of my message
[1:34:59] praise the Lord
[1:35:02] she's better than seven sons
[1:35:05] that's not what I'm preaching on this
[1:35:07] morning
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:10] glory be to God
[1:35:12] and now men took the child and it was in
[1:35:16] habuzum and she began to nurse it
[1:35:20] praise the Lord
[1:35:26] and the women
[1:35:29] her neighbors gave it
[1:35:31] a name saying there is a sun bone to now
[1:35:35] me
[1:35:36] and they call his name Obed
[1:35:39] he is the father of Jesse
[1:35:42] the father of David
[1:35:44] then the Bible says this
[1:35:49] now comes down here from verse 18 to
[1:35:53] verse 22.
[1:35:55] if you look at from Verse 18 to verse 22
[1:35:58] the Bible says these are the generation
[1:36:00] of pharaohs now you have to know that uh
[1:36:04] uh he's the son of Judah
[1:36:08] now so if you read from Verse 18 to
[1:36:11] verse 22 you will count 10th Generation
[1:36:18] praise the Lord
[1:36:20] amen you are going to count ten
[1:36:24] generation
[1:36:28] praise the Lord

[1:36:54] okay
[1:36:55] a song is born unto them
[1:37:00] the song named is Obed
[1:37:04] are we together
[1:37:06] ask yourself a question why did the Holy
[1:37:10] Spirit you give us
[1:37:13] their genology of pharaohs
[1:37:19] what important
[1:37:26] and and and the Holy Spirit will give us
[1:37:30] the generation of pharaohs
[1:37:33] and it will end on David
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:37] and when you come from pharaohs to David
[1:37:40] it's 10th Generations
[1:37:48] what is the important we're not talking
[1:37:50] about Tema here we're talking about Ruth
[1:37:54] but to show that
[1:37:57] when the the women of Israel said that
[1:38:01] when the others if this was not a women
[1:38:03] this was the address that said let your
[1:38:05] house
[1:38:06] be the house of pharaoh
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:11] because of that prophecy
[1:38:14] this genealogy was important
[1:38:23] are we together
[1:38:25] amen
[1:38:30] I told you you have to get ready to get
[1:38:32] your hands dirty
[1:38:36] let's look at Deuteronomy chapter 17.
[1:38:54] um
[1:39:00] very soon we'll realize that we are
[1:39:03] out of the house of pharaohs
[1:39:08] praise the Lord
[1:39:10] the fear of the House of pharaohs have
[1:39:12] to deal with the the the uh our natural
[1:39:16] birth
[1:39:17] and the Mystery behind our natural birth
[1:39:21] praise the Lord
[1:39:23] the reason why God's grace could reach
[1:39:26] you
[1:39:27] that's part of the family you were born
[1:39:30] that's part of the tribe you were born
[1:39:32] the country whatever wherever you were
[1:39:35] born but God's grace could reach down to
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:40] is because
[1:39:42] you were from
[1:39:48] the praise the Lord
[1:39:56] we are getting on ancestor.com
[1:40:05] amen we are checking our family tree
[1:40:11] glory be to God
[1:40:13] amen
[1:40:15] let's read something here that is very
[1:40:17] interesting
[1:40:18] Deuteronomy chapter 17 verse 14. you you
[1:40:22] will find a couple of them there in the
[1:40:24] Books of Moses
[1:40:25] but this one is is is is is uh
[1:40:30] is very interesting let's read verse 14
[1:40:32] here
[1:40:33] when thou I come unto the land which the
[1:40:37] Lord that God gave verse 14 and shall
[1:40:40] possess it and shall dwell therein
[1:40:43] and shall I say I will set a king over
[1:40:47] me
[1:40:48] like us all the nation
[1:40:52] that are about me
[1:40:56] now this is before the went to the
[1:40:58] promised land
[1:40:59] this is before Samuel was born
[1:41:04] so are you telling me that God knew that
[1:41:08] these people would desire a king
[1:41:14] are you telling me that God had in his
[1:41:16] mind
[1:41:18] that they would have a cake yes
[1:41:21] because when Judah was blessed
[1:41:24] Jacob said the scepter shall be in Judah
[1:41:28] he was speaking about a king yes that a
[1:41:31] king would come out of Judah yes
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:40] when you get to the land
[1:41:44] and you finally get to the place and say
[1:41:47] we want a king
[1:41:50] praise the Lord
[1:41:53] look
[1:41:54] said I will say it again you cannot
[1:41:57] impress God right
[1:42:01] you can impress him
[1:42:03] he knows your next step
[1:42:08] he knows your next step
[1:42:11] whatever plan we have whatever your plan
[1:42:15] is is Plan B
[1:42:21] whatever your plan is
[1:42:24] play eight
[1:42:26] father's hands
[1:42:31] oh I love it
[1:42:39] praise the Lord all your reasons we read
[1:42:42] Samuel we all read Samuel and we think
[1:42:45] that people rejected the king but their
[1:42:47] God is telling her you will you will
[1:42:49] desire a king
[1:42:52] you will come to the place where you
[1:42:54] will want to be like the rest of the
[1:42:56] nation but let me tell you when you get
[1:42:59] to that place
[1:43:08] together
[1:43:10] you see when brother Brandon preached
[1:43:12] they reject your king go back and study
[1:43:14] the message what did I say steady
[1:43:17] go back and study it when brother
[1:43:19] Branham preached the rejected King what
[1:43:21] the prophet was preaching bringing to us
[1:43:23] is that it is the rejection of the
[1:43:27] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:32] that reject
[1:43:37] amen
[1:43:39] of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:44] oh I can't read the quotes to you
[1:43:46] because I honored lightning yesterday I
[1:43:48] was just listening to him
[1:43:50] even this morning on my way to church
[1:44:04] when you get to the place and say I will
[1:44:06] set a king or I mean like us all all the
[1:44:09] nations around about me thou shy in any
[1:44:12] way set him a king over thee whom the
[1:44:15] Lord thy God has chosen so what is God
[1:44:19] is saying here when you get to that
[1:44:21] place go back to the word of God
[1:44:24] go back
[1:44:26] you must go to the one that the Lord has
[1:44:29] chosen where God said there will come a
[1:44:32] king
[1:44:33] if Israel was smart in a time of Samir
[1:44:39] praise the Lord
[1:44:41] oh I shared that with you before because
[1:44:43] when Samuel met a song what did he say
[1:44:47] am I not a Vegemite right why because he
[1:44:50] knew the promise was from Judah not from
[1:44:53] Benjamin right
[1:44:57] so even he himself knew
[1:44:59] something is wrong with this
[1:45:03] right because God is saying here the day
[1:45:05] you desire a king
[1:45:08] go to
[1:45:12] where is choosing that your king would
[1:45:14] come from
[1:45:26] praise the Lord
[1:45:29] yeah man yeah yeah yeah yeah said the
[1:45:30] king over thee whom the Lord thy God has
[1:45:33] choose one from among thy bredments shot
[1:45:38] thou sets
[1:45:39] King over me thou may have Matt said a
[1:45:43] stranger
[1:45:44] over thee
[1:45:46] which is not thy Brothers
[1:45:50] but he shall not multiply
[1:45:53] in Hershey's to himself now you can read
[1:45:55] the rest down that's why I just wanted
[1:45:57] to get that part for you go home read
[1:45:59] the rest down and you will realize that
[1:46:01] everything that God says here
[1:46:07] fulfill in the life of Solomon
[1:46:10] he had more horses he had more wives he
[1:46:13] have more everything there
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] almighty God was telling Israel their
[1:46:19] future
[1:46:27] what am I preaching this morning
[1:46:40] praise the Lord
[1:46:43] amen
[1:46:48] God
[1:46:51] how to Kink that's the reason why David
[1:46:54] was a king
[1:46:56] after God's heart
[1:46:58] he was a man after God's heart that that
[1:47:00] statement is prophetic
[1:47:06] that's the reason why the millennial
[1:47:08] Throne is promised to the son of David
[1:47:11] is called the son of David
[1:47:16] praise the Lord
[1:47:19] because he's the 10th
[1:47:25] he's the 10th after Judah
[1:47:32] Pharos became the first
[1:47:35] and David is the tenth
[1:47:41] glory be to God are we together
[1:47:46] Matthew chapter two I've not even
[1:47:49] started preaching yeah I just reading my
[1:47:51] scripture
[1:47:53] but don't worry don't worry
[1:47:55] don't worry we can have more time to
[1:47:58] continue this amen I can preach this for
[1:48:00] the rest of the year
[1:48:05] amen
[1:48:08] Matthew chapter one sorry
[1:48:11] Matthew chapter one
[1:48:19] Matthew chapter one
[1:48:21] sorry I said I said chapter two in my
[1:48:23] Lord verse chapter one verse there's one
[1:48:26] the Bible says and and uh the bulk of
[1:48:29] the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:48:32] the son of David
[1:48:35] the son of Abraham
[1:48:38] let us let us put on our thinking camp
[1:48:41] David and Abraham
[1:48:43] who was before themselves
[1:48:46] who was before the other
[1:48:54] who was before the other
[1:48:58] what are you you're behaving as if to
[1:49:00] say you are afraid
[1:49:01] Abraham was before David
[1:49:07] why will Matthew
[1:49:11] Paul the generation of Jesus Christ the
[1:49:14] son of David
[1:49:16] the son of Abraham why he did that
[1:49:26] praise the Lord
[1:49:27] why because like brother Branham said
[1:49:32] the the the the full anointing
[1:49:37] that wrote the book of of of the gospels
[1:49:40] Matthew was all of the anointing of a
[1:49:44] kinship
[1:49:48] Matthew is the only one that recorded
[1:49:50] the wise man saying where is he born
[1:49:53] King of the Jews Matthew was the only
[1:49:56] one that recorded that
[1:50:01] why because his approach
[1:50:04] told the witness of Jesus Christ was
[1:50:08] going to be all about the kinship
[1:50:13] when it is fake Abraham comes before
[1:50:16] David
[1:50:19] because it is the Faith of Our Father
[1:50:21] Abraham
[1:50:23] but when his kinship then it comes
[1:50:26] before Abraham
[1:50:28] foreign
[1:50:32] oh man
[1:50:34] praise the Lord
[1:50:37] I love the word of God
[1:50:41] amen
[1:50:44] he did not make mistakes no it was not a
[1:50:46] mistake
[1:50:48] it was the design by the Holy Spirit
[1:50:52] so when your ego I see it you can say
[1:50:55] wait something gone wrong here right
[1:50:58] right why is David
[1:50:59] before Abraham
[1:51:03] is that uh
[1:51:05] a writer's mistake no is not a righteous
[1:51:08] mistake
[1:51:10] it's a design
[1:51:15] the Holy Ghost designed it that way
[1:51:18] to be able to grab the eyes of the inlet
[1:51:25] praise the Lord
[1:51:30] was Major on the kingdom of heaven
[1:51:35] because when you have a king you have a
[1:51:38] kingdom
[1:51:45] are we together
[1:51:53] now so we we are talking about the house
[1:51:57] for us
[1:52:01] the house that Break Forth
[1:52:05] a house that overcome
[1:52:10] praise the Lord
[1:52:12] amen let's read one more verse then I
[1:52:15] can stop preaching
[1:52:21] first John chapter 2.
[1:52:23] just one more verse
[1:52:26] then you can just just let me lose
[1:52:29] thank you
[1:52:33] oh my
[1:52:36] God what a wonderful Jesus we sell yeah
[1:52:39] amen
[1:52:41] we owe him our life
[1:52:44] we owe him everything
[1:52:47] praise the Lord
[1:52:49] that's the reason why they must it must
[1:52:51] be a joyful thing for us to be in the
[1:52:54] house of the Lord we must be like David
[1:52:56] I was glad when he said unto me let us
[1:52:59] go into the house of the Lord
[1:53:00] praise the Lord
[1:53:03] because here I can yet I can hear my
[1:53:06] true story

[1:53:11] tree here in this house of the Lord
[1:53:14] praise the Lord
[1:53:17] I can hear the things that the media
[1:53:19] would not tell me right
[1:53:21] I can hear almighty God speaking to me
[1:53:30] I was glad when he said unto me
[1:53:32] let us go into the house of the Lord
[1:53:38] first John chapter 2.

[1:54:01] Patmos

[1:54:16] patma sorry I'm I'm completely in a
[1:54:19] different book

[1:54:46] I write unto you fathers because you

[1:55:00] parents to know the word right

[1:56:24] glory be to God Amen
[1:56:29] now so you see John yeah after coming
[1:56:32] back from the island of Patmos the
[1:56:35] things that was revealed to him the
[1:56:38] things that he saw looking into the
[1:56:41] future
[1:56:42] Revelation chapter 1 the Bible says this
[1:56:44] was about Jesus and the future ages of
[1:56:47] his church
[1:56:49] and those things that were revealed unto
[1:56:51] John he saw our day
[1:56:54] he saw this day that we are living in he
[1:56:57] saw all the violence you read a a
[1:57:00] Revelation chapter 9 all those
[1:57:04] horrible images
[1:57:06] that John was describing is the spirit
[1:57:09] that is doing all the murder and riffs
[1:57:12] that we have in the nation today it's no
[1:57:14] spirit that John was destroyed in
[1:57:16] Revelation chapter nine those creatures
[1:57:19] with head hanging down like women
[1:57:23] it's the demons that are that are
[1:57:25] creating all the murder
[1:57:29] making the word
[1:57:31] and unsafe place
[1:57:37] praise the Lord
[1:57:42] he saw our day
[1:57:45] he saw the evil
[1:57:47] that is upon the world today
[1:57:51] all of those spirits that are now
[1:57:54] breeding
[1:57:56] and haunting the words breathing over
[1:57:58] the word
[1:58:01] with Russia and China creating our lands
[1:58:04] and Iran and all of that
[1:58:09] praise the Lord
[1:58:14] brother Brown says the demons he says
[1:58:17] it's demon spirits
[1:58:20] he says the harbor all of the land and
[1:58:22] and and and create all of these wars
[1:58:25] powers to bring destruction upon the
[1:58:27] people yes
[1:58:33] you know when he came back out of that
[1:58:36] vision
[1:58:37] came back to the church of Ephesus
[1:58:41] he said young people
[1:58:44] praise the Lord amen
[1:58:48] he said I write unto you
[1:58:51] because you are strong
[1:58:55] right praise the Lord
[1:58:59] you might not look like you are strong
[1:59:02] right but you are strong
[1:59:06] yes glory be to God Amen because your
[1:59:09] parents never had to deal with the kind
[1:59:11] of foreign
[1:59:16] praise the Lord
[1:59:18] they have their struggle for the age
[1:59:22] by your age of virtual reality
[1:59:29] praise the Lord your age of dealing with
[1:59:33] demon evil spirit through the fourth
[1:59:37] dimension right
[1:59:38] that can engage you
[1:59:41] you get into a video games and engage
[1:59:44] you just like it's a person
[1:59:51] praise the Lord
[1:59:54] Charles say you are strong
[1:59:57] I'm seeing the C Incorruptible in you
[2:00:02] that ain't a mess of all of that you
[2:00:05] will come of us Overcomers
[2:00:07] because you were born in the house of
[2:00:09] pharaohs
[2:00:12] he breaks forth he overcame
[2:00:21] Hallelujah
[2:00:23] you see the scripture gave us all of
[2:00:27] that Foundation to make us to realize
[2:00:30] that there is nothing of our natural
[2:00:32] birth
[2:00:33] that will make us an overcomer right
[2:00:36] right because if we Trace all of our
[2:00:39] natural births
[2:00:40] we will all be born
[2:00:44] yes
[2:00:48] if we Trace all of our natural birth
[2:00:54] praise the Lord
[2:00:57] because David said a sin did my mother
[2:01:00] conceived me
[2:01:02] praise the Lord which one of us here
[2:01:04] never came that way
[2:01:08] if there is one year
[2:01:13] Hallelujah
[2:01:17] but Ram says here believe they are this
[2:01:19] he says but Jesus
[2:01:21] when he was born he was born with that
[2:01:25] Mark of being illegitimate
[2:01:28] giving our lord Jesus
[2:01:33] he was born without mark
[2:01:36] praise the Lord
[2:01:38] even though his mother was a virgin
[2:01:42] yeah praise the Lord but the birth was
[2:01:45] mysterious the Medical Science could not
[2:01:48] make sense of it right the religious
[2:01:51] people cannot find a place in the world
[2:01:53] right right
[2:02:10] Hallelujah
[2:02:14] he was born without mind of being
[2:02:16] illegitimate that his father was Joseph
[2:02:19] and that that he was born in all the
[2:02:22] word Ambassador child born by a father
[2:02:25] uh uh by a mother
[2:02:28] he was conceived before that they were
[2:02:32] married
[2:02:34] praise the Lord
[2:02:38] and I will say that's wrong because God
[2:02:41] was his father
[2:02:43] he was born at virgin birth
[2:02:46] praise the Lord
[2:02:48] God produced the blood cells
[2:02:51] God produced the exhale
[2:02:57] but you see that the system of that word
[2:03:01] put a mark on him why because they
[2:03:03] couldn't understand it
[2:03:07] they couldn't understand it
[2:03:10] now if Joseph and Mary was married
[2:03:12] nobody will know no matter where even
[2:03:15] believe Mary testimony that and angel
[2:03:17] visited her right right
[2:03:23] praise the Lord
[2:03:29] are we together
[2:03:37] now you see so you see almighty God in
[2:03:40] his mind
[2:03:41] just like God
[2:03:43] prophesying to Israel
[2:03:48] seeing their future and seeing that they
[2:03:51] will come to a place
[2:03:53] where they will say we want to be like
[2:03:55] other nations
[2:04:00] he said when you finally get to that
[2:04:02] place remember I told you that the
[2:04:04] sector will come out of Judah right
[2:04:07] right if you have anything less than
[2:04:09] that you will be out of my will
[2:04:15] right if you have a king do not want to
[2:04:17] apply in hearses why because God always
[2:04:21] wanted for his people to rely on him
[2:04:26] for strength for their battle
[2:04:30] that's right
[2:04:34] praise the Lord
[2:04:36] are we together
[2:04:42] for him we're out of seven says here he
[2:04:44] says and I believe that every Christian
[2:04:46] that's born again has has to go to those
[2:04:51] has to go to those tests every song that
[2:04:55] cometh to God must be first chest in
[2:04:57] Parts amen is that right if you cannot
[2:05:01] stand
[2:05:03] chasmine of the Lord then you become a
[2:05:07] bastard
[2:05:08] now so see where the word of God is
[2:05:11] putting the poor John we're seeing here
[2:05:14] in in and tell John that we are born of
[2:05:17] the sea Incorruptible which is the word
[2:05:20] of God
[2:05:21] so you see is that birth by the word of
[2:05:25] God that God called the origin of birth
[2:05:30] praise the Lord
[2:05:32] is that birth
[2:05:34] your new birth
[2:05:39] praise the Lord
[2:05:41] your new birth
[2:05:44] it brings you back
[2:05:46] to your original nature
[2:05:50] it brings you back to where the father
[2:05:52] wants you to be
[2:05:57] praise the Lord
[2:06:01] we love our parents we love our tribe we
[2:06:05] love our community our family
[2:06:13] praise the Lord
[2:06:15] so you see God designing for us to be
[2:06:18] able to understand it and appreciate it
[2:06:20] how we will come from an abominable
[2:06:24] birth
[2:06:25] just like Judah and tema
[2:06:28] and we will travel
[2:06:32] praise the Lord
[2:06:34] we because if you read Matthew Chapter 2
[2:06:37] you read the entire genology it's a it's
[2:06:40] a generation of Jesus Christ
[2:06:45] is mentioned in that generation Ruth is
[2:06:49] mentioned in that generation
[2:06:50] praise the Lord
[2:06:52] even belsheba
[2:06:55] yeah even though Sheba
[2:07:03] praise the Lord
[2:07:04] there are no matter
[2:07:06] what how horrible your family background
[2:07:10] might be right
[2:07:11] praise the Lord
[2:07:13] a king
[2:07:15] can be born
[2:07:17] in the manger of your heart
[2:07:21] praise the Lord
[2:07:25] no matter how horrible you are bringing
[2:07:27] might be
[2:07:31] there is something in you
[2:07:36] Break Forth
[2:07:39] praise the Lord amen amen there is
[2:07:42] something in you that can count for like
[2:07:43] fear us
[2:07:47] break out of all the odds now sit down
[2:07:51] and cry
[2:07:52] it's in you
[2:07:54] praise the Lord God blessed in you
[2:08:01] and until we come to that place
[2:08:04] come to the realization
[2:08:06] like The Prodigal Son
[2:08:09] until we wake up
[2:08:11] and come to the realization that is in
[2:08:14] you amen
[2:08:17] praise the Lord
[2:08:19] the father never wrote a letter and sent
[2:08:21] it to his son and said son is okay come
[2:08:23] back home now no it was in him
[2:08:27] when he woke up and he got to the place
[2:08:29] and said I'm tired
[2:08:31] I'm tired of this false identity

[2:11:56] they rather know all the NBA stars and
[2:11:59] all the rappers name
[2:12:01] and they cannot even quote one Bible
[2:12:03] verse
[2:12:10] that's how far the generation is getting
[2:12:12] away from the house of the Lord yeah
[2:12:14] yeah getting away from the congregation
[2:12:16] of the Lord
[2:12:19] it's not how smart and how cool we dress
[2:12:21] them to be in church where is your heart
[2:12:25] where is the heart of these young ones
[2:12:45] yeah the word of God
[2:12:47] is trying to show our journey
[2:12:51] trying to show our journey
[2:12:59] praise the Lord
[2:13:01] I know there is no horrible thing
[2:13:06] that you can go through whether you are
[2:13:10] creating it for yourself
[2:13:12] or whether you are actually going
[2:13:14] through it
[2:13:15] there will stay a way out
[2:13:21] praise the Lord amen am I honest too yes
[2:13:25] yes amen there is no horrible thing
[2:13:28] whether you are creating it for yourself
[2:13:33] oh you are actually going through it
[2:13:39] it's a way out
[2:13:41] and praise the Lord because there will
[2:13:44] always be in the house of pharaohs
[2:13:47] there will always be a house that will
[2:13:49] overcome there will always be a house
[2:13:53] that will rise above the struggle
[2:13:56] rise above the failures
[2:14:00] praise the Lord
[2:14:03] I'm here to tell you this morning that
[2:14:08] you can be a better boy you can be a
[2:14:11] better girl
[2:14:14] praise the Lord
[2:14:15] amen we can be better husbands to our
[2:14:17] wives
[2:14:20] to our husbands right we can be better
[2:14:23] Sons and Daughters of God in the house
[2:14:26] of God and in the service of the Lord
[2:14:31] praise the Lord
[2:14:32] it does not come by joining the church
[2:14:35] it comes from a birth
[2:14:42] I'll tell you how thy birth you will
[2:14:44] hang on as long as you can hang on
[2:14:47] right
[2:14:49] if you don't have that birth you will
[2:14:52] let go yes
[2:15:01] yes praise the Lord
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:04] that's God's love
[2:15:07] for you and myself you see when God look
[2:15:10] at that law
[2:15:11] when he looked at the law
[2:15:15] of
[2:15:17] an illegitimately try like brother
[2:15:19] Brandon was saying he says yeah I was
[2:15:21] reading one quote there he says this
[2:15:23] does not sound like a nice word so let's
[2:15:25] say an illegitimate child
[2:15:27] he said the Bible there in the Bible
[2:15:30] they call it a Rasta child he said it
[2:15:31] does not sound like a nice word but
[2:15:33] let's call it an idiot
[2:15:36] if you look at God's law
[2:15:40] praise the Lord
[2:15:41] God was not even
[2:15:44] he was not aiming at a vulnerable woman
[2:15:48] that could not help herself
[2:15:50] praise the Lord and then she ever get
[2:15:52] him pregnant by a useless man
[2:15:55] God will be cruel what did that child
[2:15:59] did
[2:16:03] but you see the law of God goes back to
[2:16:07] the beginning
[2:16:08] God was addressing the best that took
[2:16:10] place in eating
[2:16:13] praise the Lord
[2:16:22] Hallelujah
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:28] that's the reason why the word of God
[2:16:30] could pick up
[2:16:33] a woman
[2:16:34] that will come to the feet of Jesus
[2:16:36] weeping
[2:16:38] that's the reason why he could go by the
[2:16:40] Sumerian well
[2:16:43] and still give hope to a woman that have
[2:16:45] six men in her life
[2:17:04] praise the Lord
[2:17:08] if we are realize Jews are Gentiles we
[2:17:13] are all born
[2:17:15] from the house of perish
[2:17:20] no matter how how many laws they keep
[2:17:24] they all came from the house of pharaohs
[2:17:38] praise the Lord
[2:17:40] what am I trying to do this morning this
[2:17:43] afternoon time I should let you go
[2:17:46] what am I trying to do
[2:17:50] see because when we can never get to the
[2:17:53] place to appreciate the grace of God
[2:17:55] that has come to us yes
[2:17:58] amen
[2:18:01] if we can never get to that place
[2:18:04] oh man I wrote something down
[2:18:15] someone said
[2:18:17] it's the difference
[2:18:19] between
[2:18:21] privilege
[2:18:23] and entitlement
[2:18:26] is gratefulness
[2:18:32] it's gratefulness
[2:18:35] many many of us thinks that we are
[2:18:38] entitled right
[2:18:41] I'm born in a message you are never
[2:18:43] there is nobody that is born in this
[2:18:45] message is the other way around the
[2:18:48] message must be born in you
[2:18:53] praise the Lord
[2:18:57] you were born in Saint John or Saint
[2:18:59] Mary Hospital you are now born in the
[2:19:01] message
[2:19:09] praise the Lord and because of that
[2:19:11] mentality we think that we are entitled
[2:19:14] yes
[2:19:15] now people should save us
[2:19:28] is gratefulness yes
[2:19:31] when you start being grateful
[2:19:34] you are making a lot of room to be
[2:19:37] protected
[2:19:39] if you stop being grateful
[2:19:42] you are allowing the Holy Ghost to come
[2:19:45] your way
[2:19:46] you say Lord I don't deserve it
[2:19:49] I don't deserve this when I see what
[2:19:52] other young people are going through and
[2:19:54] you've been so merciful to me
[2:19:59] you stop being grateful
[2:20:02] yourself
[2:20:06] but when you think that you are a
[2:20:08] privileged child yeah
[2:20:12] oh you are entitled
[2:20:26] thank you
[2:20:32] praise the Lord
[2:20:36] this word is the origin of see I
[2:20:38] read this and then we close musicians
[2:20:40] you can come
[2:20:42] just like I said Wednesday night
[2:20:45] I want you to get any kind of a
[2:20:47] misconception that uh uh
[2:20:51] trying to fuss against you if you think
[2:20:54] so meet me in the office we settle our
[2:20:55] differences
[2:20:56] praise the Lord
[2:20:58] amen
[2:21:00] when you see
[2:21:02] that was the thing that broke my heart
[2:21:04] last Sunday
[2:21:05] we were there
[2:21:07] and I was I was seeing how this young
[2:21:10] man
[2:21:11] was trying to struggle to keep his son
[2:21:13] away
[2:21:14] Maybe
[2:21:16] not for the visitors not to know that he
[2:21:19] have a special needs son
[2:21:21] it broke my spirit
[2:21:25] and my mind starts to go back and I
[2:21:27] start to think
[2:21:30] how the people sit in church with
[2:21:32] special needs
[2:21:34] they have a special needs in their life
[2:21:38] but because they think they are entitled
[2:21:40] or they are a privileged child
[2:21:46] nobody can talk to me this way
[2:21:49] nobody must say this to me
[2:21:55] and you know what special need brings it
[2:21:58] brings a
[2:22:03] sin it brings a sense of Shame
[2:22:16] and all through the wig are just going I
[2:22:18] was just thinking
[2:22:20] I said Lord
[2:22:22] how many times we do the same
[2:22:27] how many times we do the same
[2:22:32] you see the early church was not like
[2:22:34] that
[2:22:37] the Bible says they went from house to
[2:22:40] house breaking bread right and many of
[2:22:42] the time the things that we do the Bible
[2:22:44] says those people that were into
[2:22:46] witchcraft they brought their books
[2:22:48] destroy them and the apostles feet
[2:22:49] whenever they had a special need they
[2:22:52] reigned to the house of God and said
[2:22:54] Bradleys this is my situation
[2:22:57] that was all the early church was
[2:23:01] did they not have their need of God in
[2:23:04] their life try to put up that kind of a
[2:23:07] religious spirits
[2:23:09] right
[2:23:10] one of them tried to do it as chapter
[2:23:12] 16. a young lady started growing this
[2:23:15] man I'm the man of God this man a holy
[2:23:17] man this man a holy man
[2:23:20] Paul says this is not a right spirit
[2:23:23] you might be a privileged child but this
[2:23:26] is not the right spirit
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:40] all right
[2:23:45] foreign
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:10] but if we would just realize how much
[2:24:12] blessed that we are
[2:24:14] [Music]
[2:24:16] how much blessed that we are
[2:24:20] to have young people
[2:24:24] in our
[2:24:27] Church
[2:24:29] the message
[2:24:31] [Music]
[2:24:33] in the midst of all of your struggle
[2:24:37] they still love God
[2:24:39] [Music]
[2:24:48] you go to other societies and other
[2:24:51] communities you realize
[2:24:55] foreign
[2:24:58] this generation of young people
[2:25:02] the way they view the church
[2:25:05] [Music]
[2:25:09] the things that I try to do to get away
[2:25:11] shot away from the church
[2:25:13] [Music]
[2:25:19] if we
[2:25:21] as a church
[2:25:23] as a group of people
[2:25:26] that comes to this place
[2:25:28] Wednesday night and Sunday morning
[2:25:32] I call this place home church and and
[2:25:36] and support it with your Finance your
[2:25:39] tithes and your offering
[2:25:43] just realize

[2:25:55] praise the Lord
[2:25:57] [Music]
[2:25:58] how much more than the Holy Ghost
[2:26:02] want to do in your home in your life
[2:26:07] foreign how much reality

[2:26:12] Wednesday night after the service
[2:26:15] step back he had a little baby I just
[2:26:18] had a good time because I mean there was
[2:26:19] just such a present year Wednesday night
[2:26:22] the beautiful presence
[2:26:26] and I went back to that scripture
[2:26:30] even the Sun that was in the house
[2:26:34] the one that thought that he never
[2:26:36] smoked
[2:26:37] he never drank he never did nothing
[2:26:39] wrong
[2:26:40] because of that he thought that he was
[2:26:43] entitled
[2:26:47] praise the Lord
[2:26:54] I think brother Jordan brought that up
[2:26:56] for us one time and I'll tell you that
[2:26:58] that was a beautiful message you never
[2:27:00] left my mind
[2:27:01] [Music]
[2:27:10] was his
[2:27:14] praise the Lord
[2:27:15] maybe he thought he was trying to
[2:27:18] impress the father
[2:27:20] well all he needed to do was just to
[2:27:23] wake up
[2:27:26] just to wake up
[2:27:30] [Music]
[2:27:37] I pray that the holy spirit will take
[2:27:39] these words and
[2:27:41] any sudden to your heart because he's
[2:27:43] the preacher
[2:27:45] you would go home and pick up the
[2:27:47] scripture that looked dead and God who
[2:27:49] starts to speak to you
[2:27:51] who starts to address your need in your
[2:27:53] life
[2:27:57] no matter what what our struggle is
[2:28:00] our struggled it's only a house of
[2:28:04] Harris
[2:28:06] it's a house of Judah
[2:28:08] our our struggle is a house of lot and
[2:28:12] his daughters
[2:28:13] but when God bring you forth as a Son of
[2:28:16] God or as a daughter of God we know when
[2:28:19] the grace of God wrap your heart and
[2:28:21] realize I can live better than this
[2:28:25] I can live better than it's in you to do
[2:28:28] it you don't need religion to put it in
[2:28:30] you it's in You by a predestinator see
[2:28:33] God has already placed in you
[2:28:35] it's in you to be better
[2:28:38] [Music]
[2:28:45] I stand to our feet
[2:28:52] Jesus
[2:28:55] has changed my home
[2:29:10] thank you

[2:31:11] no matter what trouble am I have we
[2:31:14] found
[2:31:15] my little child
[2:31:17] [Music]
[2:31:22] if we if you step out of
[2:31:25] the place of entitlement
[2:31:28] because entitlement sometimes put a
[2:31:31] Christian to the place where you think
[2:31:32] that because you are a Christian your
[2:31:35] child is better than all the other
[2:31:36] children
[2:31:38] thank you
[2:31:41] but if if gratefulness step in you will
[2:31:44] realize that you are grateful
[2:31:47] they are not the best but you are still
[2:31:49] grateful
[2:31:52] they are going through things they are
[2:31:55] dealing with things
[2:31:59] it might be your husband it might be
[2:32:01] your wife
[2:32:03] even children it might be your parents
[2:32:11] before that God has given you the
[2:32:15] parents that he has given you
[2:32:18] [Music]
[2:32:27] if we brothers would just be thankful
[2:32:29] for our wives
[2:32:36] if you just be thankful for your wives
[2:32:38] they are the mothers of your children
[2:32:46] they are mad what we want them to be the
[2:32:50] reason is because you don't make them
[2:32:51] because if you were born to be the one
[2:32:53] to make them you are going to make them
[2:32:55] the way you want them to be you never
[2:32:57] make them
[2:33:03] is where we express gratefulness to God
[2:33:18] if we will be grateful for the man that
[2:33:20] God put over us to be the head of the
[2:33:23] home
[2:33:25] he might not be the smartest one or the
[2:33:28] richest one
[2:33:30] praise the Lord
[2:33:37] just look at the house from the outside
[2:33:38] you don't know the things that is
[2:33:40] happening behind those walls
[2:33:44] but when you have a home
[2:33:47] where you can sit down
[2:33:48] [Music]
[2:33:51] your child might come in and slam the
[2:33:53] door but they're coming
[2:33:55] that's what is good they're coming
[2:33:57] even though they slam the door they're
[2:33:59] not supposed to slam the door but the
[2:34:00] father is that they have coming
[2:34:04] [Music]

[2:34:14] me but it's good school she talking to
[2:34:15] you
