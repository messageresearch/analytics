And uh uh we want to uh once again thank you for uh giving us the time on on Sunday that uh we will be that we were able to talk with you. Okay. Okay, there we definitely place that before the Lord and uh uh thank you for bearing with me on Sunday. Uh I know to some and many uh all that was said was was nothing new, but I needed I needed that time. I just needed that time and yet uh I never had time enough. Praise the Lord. I never had time enough because there were just a lot of things that I noted down. But uh let me let me say this to you. Uh uh you know uh I think brother Brandon said it somewhere. You know uh leading the church is just like flying a plane. and flying a plane, the highest thing is to get it off the ground. Praise the Lord. The the pilot never goes into autopilot until the plane has got off the ground. And uh uh and when you get off the ground, you cannot stay in the air forever. You got to come down to refuel. So I believe that we are refueling. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we have got this thing up before. Amen. And I believe we can get it up again. &gt;&gt; You know, just praying on the weekend. Uh uh I was I was really really thinking that I would come and I really wanted to vent on you. You people talk to me. I just listen. I wanted to use Sunday as my time to just vent. But at a certain point of time, I mean the Lord just he just ministered to my heart that I need to trust him. Amen. I need to trust him. So there were just a lot of things I just thought that I should I should you know I should just uh forget about them you know and just uh encourage you a little bit talk to you and then we just pick up few of the things and but thank you thank you there were many many people that supported the children's Sunday school it was coming from every word and that was that was very impressive and also there were many people that also supported the church building project. So that was that was good. That was good. And uh so thank you. Thank you for bearing with me. If uh if we have any other update for you or I need to come back and vent again, I will I will beg for time with you. Amen. I will beg for time with you. But uh it was it was good. And and the thing about it there also uh uh one of my my the major thing that was that was really on my heart was uh you know uh uh like we said brother Brandon said we come to church to become better people and we cannot become a better people until we have a better environment &gt;&gt; to be able to grow in for us to become better. So I want you to labor with me. Let's let's work together and create an atmosphere. Amen. &gt;&gt; For us to become better people. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's that's what I want for us to labor on. Let's just take this prayer need this uh there's a dear preacher brother whose funeral comes up this weekend and uh sister has put a request. Sister Joy, let's pray. Father, many will be traveling and oh God, we just want to pray that Father, you give them a good time. And Lord, also, Father, just talking to another minister, Lord, there were some ministers that were out uh also for the funeral and uh some of the brothers, God, kidnapped and uh and they've been working on their release. Uh we just uh want to commit that need also in your hands. and father over there in Nigeria. Bless brother Olu in the church there in Lagos. Father as they deal with that and Lord God we just ask your wonderful blessing upon the bride of Jesus Christ. Your people are dealing with many different things Lord. Oh God father some churches are dealing with a lot of people that are that have cancers and people that are out of the hospital sold and know father God and this is what we deal with while we are here. While we are here, Father, no doubt to God, Moses with those two million peoples, Father, he had in his uh as his prescription, you are the Lord that healed all our diseases. And Father God, you are the one Lord Jesus that uh that deal with all of our needs. We love you. We thank you tonight. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Yeah. just just uh remembering this need. I was talking to brother Valentine yesterday and then he told me about that need of those uh uh brothers. They were traveling for the funeral. Uh they from Lagos church, one of the churches there in Lagos uh Christian assembly and uh and some of the brothers got they got kidnapped. So uh brothers been praying about it and trying to see how they can get him out of that situation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes, you know, uh uh uh it's so easy to make you to wonder why, you know, uh sometimes God's people can be trapped in these things. But the Lord knows why. Amen. Whatever come away, God knows why. You have to you have to realize and learn and believe that there's nothing that can come your way except the Lord allow it. &gt;&gt; And if he allow it, he has a good reason. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every every problem is for an testimony. Amen. There's a testimony behind every problem. So uh uh that that teach us to take comfort in the things that uh Yeah. Okay. So, uh, tonight, let's just let's just take our Bibles. Revelation chapter 5. Revelation chapter 5. Let's go to Revelation chapter 5 tonight. And, uh, it's 8:15. I have uh 45 minutes or so to to be able to hold you here. And I just pray that it's a good 45 minutes. Praise the Lord. It's a good 45 minutes. Revelation chapter 5. We been been kind of for dwelling on this, you know. Uh, and I thank the Lord that I went into this gear because if I was not in this space, maybe I would have just been all over the place preaching like an evangelist trying to trying to make my frustration a message. That's a horrible thing to do. &gt;&gt; That's a very, very horrible thing to do. Praise the Lord. Amen. Revelation chapter 5, let's just read. And I saw in the hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof. Praise the Lord. who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, bless your word and come speak to us tonight. May something be said of eternal value. Something that the souls of your children can feel on something that can build faith and strength for the hour that we are living in. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat while we stay right there in in in uh Revelation chapter 5. But why the reason why I stopped on that verse because I wanted to I wanted to bring up another principle uh uh out of the book of Romans. Romans chapter 8. We'll go back to Revelation chapter 5 but Romans chapter 8. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God be for us. Who can be against us? &gt;&gt; That's what Paul says here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now Paul will speak here and says that uh uh Romans chapter 8, let's read from verse 32. He that spare not his own son, but deliver him up for us all. How shall he not with him also freely give us all things? He has given us all things. Now watch the principle that I wanted for for us to look at tonight. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God elect? Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 was who is worthy. &gt;&gt; So that's that's what I want you to keep in your mind. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God elect? It is God. It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died. Yeah. Rather, that is raising again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us. So which mean Christ will not be the one that condemn. Amen. The board is asking who laid anything to God's to God's elect and elect cannot persecute illet. Amen. Who is he that condemnth? Christ will not condemn because he was the one that gave his life. He was the one that raised again. Amen. And make intercession for us. Then he said this also. Who shall separate us? So we see three wolves here. Now what? Watch what I want to look at. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, shall distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, per or swore? Now uh uh we have we I've talked on this before. I've used this before, but uh just thinking about who is worthy and before we go back there, my mind came back to this. Now Paul is saying, who shall separate us? Who is he that condemnth? Who will lead anything to God's uh uh to the charge of God's elect? Who shall separate us? Then he come and said shall persecution. Now uh grammatically you will not use woo for persecution. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You would say what shall separate us? &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see here there is a person. &gt;&gt; There's a personality that is behind &gt;&gt; persecution. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's a person that is behind distresses. There's a person that is behind uh persecution, tribulation, famine, you know, nakedness, swallow wall. There is a personality. Now you have to think about the the beast &gt;&gt; the rathers. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the same person here. So Paul is saying who shall separate us? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then he said find me tribulation. So which mean there is a personality that is disguised &gt;&gt; behind everything that we are dealing with. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you Are you seeing it? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whether it is farming, whether it is uh uh uh illnesses in our body, anything that want to separate us from the love of God. It is not it's not just the weather. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. It's not just the weather. I'm not just honor the weather. No, there is something. There is a being. There is a person, there is a there's there's a creature, there's a power, there's an influence that want to separate you from the love of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So it's not just a persecution. It's not just that they are persecuting me. No, there is there is a being that is disgust in that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when you can be able to identify the being, then you can know how to fight your battle. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can know how to face your persecution. &gt;&gt; Then you not you don't make it uh uh people, person, government, &gt;&gt; but you deal with that spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As soon as you identify it, then it helps you to run to the city of refuge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because you know that there is a spirit that is behind this thing. &gt;&gt; It is not just people attitude or people don't love me but there is a spirit &gt;&gt; that is trying to separate you from the love of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So that's what I wanted to to uh to that's that's where I wanted to start off tonight. Revelation chapter 5. Let's go back there. while you are having the comfort of your seat and uh verse two I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is watered down. So here again who is used is looking for a person a personality not just anything not just anybody or uh not just anything let me say it that way but it's looking for the person and not just anybody too because this person has to be a wealthy person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is wealthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof. And the Bible says, "No man, no man." And Yis said, "We have this book of life in our hands, in the shelf, in our homes, have it on our phone, and we can go there and read, copy, paste, and and send to people, and we can read it and and you know, and and and and you know, express our our thought about it." But yet the Bible says no man was warfare. No man in heaven, not even the earth, neither under the earth, which mean all those that lived and were gone from Adam uh uh uh to to John the Baptist neither to look there on to open the book or to look there on. The Bible says, "And I and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book." So I was thinking about this today and I was just looking at the parallel. Now here is uh uh one that is also disguised behind this need. There's a there's a being here that is being required. If there is no man that is worth then how is the book going to be open? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh right here also give us an idea. If there is no man that was warfare then the word creator amen had to now step down &gt;&gt; he has to come down and take the form of a man because it was a man &gt;&gt; that was required here who is walking. They was not looking for, you know, a lamb or a lion or uh uh uh you know, a ox. They were looking for a man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Woo is one thing. You will not I don't think you will use woo for a lion. You cannot use woo for a lamb. You use woo for a person. &gt;&gt; Am I right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As far as uh uh uh my English is, I think I'm right on that one. Amen. I'm proud of myself. Praise the Lord. No man. So, so which mean here if no man in heaven the earth and have ever lived and under the earth was worthy then there must be one. But yet this one will still have to be a man because the advertisement the proclamation was for who is wanting. So there have to be a person. So it has to be a kingsman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has to be a kingsman. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Who is wealthy? And I wept much because no man was formed worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on. Praise the Lord. Our service tonight will be useless if there was now one that came forth &gt;&gt; to open the book. &gt;&gt; Our service will be useless because we'll be reading. How can you read from a closed book? &gt;&gt; You will just be guessing. &gt;&gt; You'll be guessing. I think the first chapter in this book, if I can remember, I think they told me in there maybe is Jeremiah. you'll just be guessing because it's a closed book, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I mean uh whatever sounds very close to truth, you will believe it easily. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why you know people uh h motivational speakers can can see something that sound so close to reasoning but it's not from an open book. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just good enough for your spirit to feel on it, but your soul will never feel on there &gt;&gt; because the soul can only feel on what comes from the open book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that sounds Oh yeah, I never thought about that. Oh man, I never thought about that. Sounds so truth. is good for your mind. &gt;&gt; And your mind keeps spinning, but it can't drop down to your soul because your soul does not have a taste for that. &gt;&gt; The soul can only feed on what comes from God's mouth. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let me let me share where I want to go tonight. where I want to go tonight. I'm still talking about my my uh my beast and rider and uh uh the last sermon I put the riders and the beast. I think we should change that. It's not riders. It's just one rather it's one that is just riding on different beasts. So we will have to change that. The first I got it right. The second one I tried to change it but we will correct that now. So tonight I I wanted to take from Revelation chapter 5 here and uh uh let me let me read down a little bit. Oh my goodness me. Oh man. Let me read down a little bit tonight. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a mighty God we serve. is a good one too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Uh so let's let's read down a little bit here. And I wept much. No man was for walting to open and to read a book, neither to look there on. And one of the elders said unto me, weep not behold the lion of the trap of Judah, the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to and to lose the seven seals thereof. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before I go further, I'll be away this weekend. It just popped in my mind. I'll be away this weekend. Brother Per annual meeting comes up and uh he asked for us to speak for him on Sunday. So uh pray for me. I'll be sharing uh the meeting with brother Ben and brother Clay Farmer. So uh just pray for me. Praise the Lord. And then also uh uh pray for brother Avery. He will preach for us on Sunday too. So okay, let's get back to reading here. Verse six. And I beheld and loo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the head of stool a lamb as it have been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirit of God sent forth into all the earth. So I wanted to look at the seven spirit tonight. We not we're not done with our our our rather and be here yet. But there was something that caught my mind and that's what I want to share with you tonight if we will get there. Let's take our first quote here. Revelation chapter 5. This is what caught my mind. Brother Brandham said very beautiful, very beautiful, you know. Uh uh it really did not digest it like like the way it is digested to me. Now he says here he says now we find out that in the first beginning of the chapter and we find the revelation revelation uh find the fifth chapter is just a tie block. Amen. He call it a tie block. Uh man uh u I forget I didn't send the picture up there. He call it a tie block. He call it a diamond hinge that tie the last part of the church ages of Revelation chapter 3. Now listen carefully because uh it's very easy to go over your head if uh and and I've read it read it. It went over my head many times, but this time it was just like an arrow that pierced my heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It went over my head. I don't think I was I was purposely dodging it, but I was just not getting it. But this time, it just hit me. Now, listen to what he says here. We find out that revelation uh the fifth chapter is just a tie blood a diamond hinge that tie the last part of the church ages of revelation chapter 3. So revelation five ties the last end of revelation 3. You will understand as we read a little bit. He says here the fourth chapter tells what John was taken up into heaven. And the fifth chapter is preparing where you went through the seven church ages. Then John lifted up in the fourth chapter. And the fifth chapter he's just setting the scene. He's setting the scene here for the opening of the seals just as he did in the first chapter of in in the first chapter of Revelation. So, Revelation chapter one was setting the scene for the church ages. Revelation chapter 5 is setting the scene. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll get the picture as we go along. I'll go into setting the scene and if there is any time left then we'll get into the seven spirit. I want you to get that picture correctly. He says revelation the the fifth chapter is just setting the scene here for the opening of the seals just as he did in the first chapter of Revelation opening the way for the seven church ages. Listen to this now. There he stands in the seven golden candlesticks and and he's to look upon as jasper and sadder stones and uh he's preparing for those seven church ages. Now he's preparing for the opening of the seven seals of redemption. That's what the fifth chapter is. That is the reason I kind of read it and then just take it from there and talk on it and give other parts of the scripture is because it isn't verse by verse. The scene that is happening are not verse by verse, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because it's setting a scene. It's almost like when you when you're about to watch uh h a movie and then uh they give you uh h a starting a starting picture of all the players. Sometimes they are not talking. They just come this the the little boy he's riding his bicycle and his name comes up you know and he run around the house and then another person come and and the lady come and you know uh uh and she's uh you know she's standing on a porch and she doing like you are not hearing what she's saying but you're seeing and all of these part that comes at the beginning are going to be part of the big picture. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's he's telling us both Revelation chapter 1 and Revelation chapter 5 is not a verse byvere happening. Okay, &gt;&gt; they're happening the the the the the things happening in the chapter. Verse seven could be at the beginning, verse two could be at the end of the scene because sometimes you watch those things there, you know, and if you pay attention to that, you you you want to see the little boy that was riding the bicycle at the beginning of the movie. But sometime he does not come until maybe in the middle of the movie. You see, but the little boy that is riding the bicycle could be the newspaper man. He could be the manager in that movie, but it just show him riding the bicycle. And as you follow the movie, then you realize he was riding the bicycle to school. He went to school and then he graduate. That's how he became the manager of the company. &gt;&gt; But all of those things are not in the scene. &gt;&gt; Are we getting the picture? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, this thing was beautiful. I was making movie this morning. When I was studying this, I was making movie in my mind. &gt;&gt; I was trying to set the scene. But God is a movie maker. I will tell you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had a great drama in his mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's a movie maker. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the reason he says here that's the reason I kind of for read it and then just take it from there. I talk on it and give other parts of the scripture. So he says I talk on this part and then I move to another part of the scripture to explain it because this is just a scene. You will not fully understand it if we just go verse by verse, verse by verse. It does not explain. It does not have all of the details. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It don't have all the details. It just set you in the scene. It says uh yes. So other part is because it it is in verse by verse something that's happening is preparing for something to happen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something to happen. Oh, I love this. And if you get the preparation, if you get the preparation and you are paying attention, praise the Lord, you are praying attention, you get the preparation, uh then you are ready for it then and that's the way it is by faith or anything is you got to grab the seam. Brother Baron says to apply faith is the seam. You got to grab the scene to be able to apply faith because uh faith must have its resting place. &gt;&gt; Faith just do not, you know, you don't throw faith in the air that I believe God, you know, God, you know, God said you must be able to get his resting place. And how can you get it? Because you can look in the life of Sarah and say God did it for Sarah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So because God did it for Sarah now in in in in in the in the fullness here now I can I can I can be able to see that that that was in the scene playing out in my life. &gt;&gt; Because they were all types and shadow of us. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; So we you just don't throw f oh yeah I believe I know that God would do it. I know that God would do it and you know I believe that God would do it. Oh, you must set a scene. Go into the word. Set a scene. I saw that he did it for Hana. I saw he did it for Gideon. &gt;&gt; Gideon was nervous. He was not sure. And yet God called him a mighty man of valor &gt;&gt; and God was able to bring him. So no matter what nervousness that is going in my body, no matter what uh uh uh insecurity I'm having, I know that God says I'm a mighty man of illum. If he could bring Gideon through, he would bring me through also &gt;&gt; because the scripture is setting a scene. &gt;&gt; Faith is you just don't throw faith out there. I believe that God will do it. No, look for a scene. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh man, I love this. I told you I say I was I was making movie this morning. I love it. I love it. I love it. Let me do something here quickly. Isaiah chapter 61. Isaiah chapter 61. Amen. Isaiah chapter 61. Are we together tonight? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Is the word of God getting home? &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 61, let's read here. For the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he have anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He has sent me to burn up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the praising to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of virgins of our God, to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty of h for arches, oil of joy, for moouring garment of praise, for the spirit of heaven ess that they might be called the tree of righteousness, the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Right here, God set a scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to he's Isaiah is prophesying about the Miah. He's talking about his entire ministry, the the three and a half years he will spend on earth and the ministry that will also be fulfilled in the gentile. Everything is right here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This prophecy even cover you and myself. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now let's go to St. Luke chapter 4. Let's go to St. Luke chapter 4. This is familiar ground for you, but uh uh it's okay. So Luke chapter 4, let's let's read from verse 14. I want to read from verse 14 tonight. The Bible says uh uh and Jesus returning, he was returning from the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had just gone through the temptation in the wilderness. He was coming out of the wilderness. But this is what I want you to pay attention to. Jesus returning in the power of the spirit. He's returning in the power of the spirit. what the Isaiah said, the spirit of the Lord God is upon me. &gt;&gt; That's what Isaiah said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So now he's returning in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out affirm of him through all the region around about and he taught in their synagogues uh being glorified of all. So he left Galilee now he comes into Nazareth because this scene that was set in Isaiah is about to be play out. the part that Isaiah could not say. Isaiah never talk about him going in Galilee. Isaiah never talk about him, you know, going in Nazareth. Isaiah just said, "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me for he have anointed me." But yet Jesus now is coming to play out everything that Isaiah said. &gt;&gt; Right from the wilderness, he went into Galilee. The spirit of the Lord is upon him. He went into the synagogues, you know, he's teaching. He's speaking to the people. He came down to Nazareth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, see here now, uh, like I said, this is familiar territory. I took it back a little bit just to get your attention. And he came to Nazareth where he was brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogues again on the Sabbath day. His custom was to go to church. and and he stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet. Now see here because the scene was set is God that set the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God that he wrote the the the drama. &gt;&gt; He wrote the movie. He's the composer. So when it got to this place for Jesus to fulfill that, he went into the synagogues, he's not a rabbi, he's not of the Sanhedrin's council. He's now of the priest. But because what was in the the the scene is about to be fulfilled. As he got into the synagogues, they hand him the straw. &gt;&gt; They never asked him, "Who are you? What school? What church you belong to? Because God has already written out. So what he did, the scene is set. There is something that Jesus is playing on. He's not just doing his own thing. Isaiah said, "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So when he waited in a wilderness and the spirit of the Lord God came upon him, he came out of the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he was born to step right into the synagogues. And as soon as he got there, that spirit that was upon him seized the Pharisees, they never had no argument. They said, "Yeah, take the book." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He took the book and the Bible says he opened to Isaiah 61. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he started reading what is in Isaiah 61. you open the book and he started to read and and there was delivered unto him a book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written this is where the seed was written I'm here to fulfill what is written on this scene &gt;&gt; because the scene is set &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; so that's what brother Brian was telling us revelation chapter 5 is just setting the scene Amen. You cannot understand everything about the open book just in Revelation chapter 5. It's in Revelation chapter 4. It's in Revelation chapter 6. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's where the the the the beasts and the rathers are. But Revelation 5 is just the scene. The scene is set there. So here the scene is said Jesus comes right there. He open the book and and and and then he reading the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives, the recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. So in one sense he's saying in the in the seed that is giving us is only this part we will fulfill. So when he read to preach the acceptable year of the Lord the Bible says and he closed the book. He never read everything Isaiah said. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He closed the book right there and he said to them this day &gt;&gt; this scripture &gt;&gt; is fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From now on, everything that Isaiah said, he will he will open the blind eyes. He will set the captive free. Come and follow me because this day, this scripture, we are about to play out what is written here. &gt;&gt; Everything that is written right here, I'm here to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he could say, I there is no sahedrin counsel that can stop me. There is no devil in hell. Even the Roman power cannot stop me because it is written and I'm here to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the scene is set. &gt;&gt; And that is the same thing with you and you and myself. Our being here this evening, &gt;&gt; the scene is set. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. our being here in this age and and in this dark age, the scene is set. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; See what God will do. &gt;&gt; He's uh he's the composer of the music. &gt;&gt; And he's also the director. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what he would do, years would go by and and you know things will happen and then and then he this this this this uh uh this man from uh h can Turkey a seventh grade student you know uh God will raise him up with a vision do not smoke do not drink don't defile your body I have a work for you he will get in the ministry and on and on he will go and and uh uh uh and one day he will want to preach a message called birth him &gt;&gt; in a full h gospel businessman meeting. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And his wife will buy him a Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a new Bible. And then he's he's there. Brother B don't even have an idea of what is happening. But because Isaiah wrote it, &gt;&gt; the composer already wrote it &gt;&gt; and he was on the scene to direct it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "This is the time for that second part of what Isaiah said to be fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, what he's going to do, he's going to take this preacher out of his normal routine. He's not going to use his steady Bible. He's going to use a new Bible that his wife bought. And then he's looking for the page. He two pages stuck together. He's just passing. He try to read. No, this is not what I want to read. Oh, did they cut the page out of the Bible? Oh my god. &gt;&gt; So he asked the brother, "Is that the same thing in your Bible?" Because I can't find what I want to read. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And because God said the same, so God will repeat the same thing that happened in Jesus ministry because it's the continuation of the spirit. So then a a a Catholic priest, Bishop Stenic will take his Bible and say, "My son, take this Bible." &gt;&gt; Because God is about to move. &gt;&gt; He don't even know what is happening. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, because the script is written, it cannot be different the same way it happened in Jesus ministry. It was the continuation of that scripture. It had to happen the same way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I mean, uh, here is their brother. They're confused. He can't understand what is happening. God arrested the the the the He arrested the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He arrested all the players. I mean, he had brother Kyle Williams behind him. He had Demon Shakaran behind him. None of them gave Brother Brandham their Bible. It had to be a Catholic priest because it was a priest that gave the Bible to Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He set the scene. You cannot change it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He is the director. You cannot change it. You cannot follow the emotion of the people to change the order of the director. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody could change it. &gt;&gt; He's talking to those preachers down there. Is this not in your Bible? I mean, it would have been easy for him to say, "Well, give me your Bible, Brother Cow Williams. Let me use it." or brother demon you're carrying or h or brother Jack Moore gave me your Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But because God was in control of the scene, God took the the he took that from their mind. They were all just sitting there looking at him. &gt;&gt; What what Bible is he reading from? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because what he trying to read, he can't even find it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then God has to anoint this uh Catholic bishop, Bishop Stanley. He stood up and said, he says, "Take my," he said, "Take my Bible, son, because God is about to move." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when brother Brandham took his Bible, it was not even a Catholic Bible. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It was not even a Catholic Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon read the scripture he wanted to read from from from St. John and he closed the Bible the same way Jesus closed the book. &gt;&gt; He gave it back to the priest the same way Jesus gave it back to the priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's standing there preaching his message, but yet in his mind he's thinking, "What's wrong? I don't want to embarrass my wife. She gave me the Bible as a gift." But okay, I mean uh being a man that has control over the anointing, it did not bother him. Went right into his message and he preached his message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And as he was leaving the meeting, the Holy Ghost brought to his mind, there is something about this in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As he was leaving the meeting, the Holy Ghost brought there is something about this in the scripture. You have just play a scene. &gt;&gt; You have played out a scene that was written. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And you see, brother Brandham could not say uh uh uh he was not playing out the scene that says uh uh what it says here to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. That's not the scene he was playing because that was where Jesus stopped. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So whatever Jesus never read out, that is that part that brother Brandon was playing. So, Brother Brandon was playing. Let's go back to Isaiah 61. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We might not get into what we wanted to preach tonight, but that's good. That's good. I'm I I wanted to I wanted for you to see this and uh uh and that's that's that's good. That's what God have for us tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we praise him for that. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see yet in Isaiah 61, Jesus tap on verse two and to proclaim the accepted way yet of the Lord. That's where he stopped. So so so brother Brandham now that that thing he was playing out was from and the day of vengeance &gt;&gt; which of course that's what he was talking in birth pains. &gt;&gt; He was talking about the word having birth pains. All the things that is happening is bringing the word to the place of judgment, the place of virgins. &gt;&gt; That's what he was talking about in that message birth pain now. So, but follow me now. And the day of virgins of our God to comfort all that mourn and to appoint because if you see it in the in the in the scripture uh uh the the the scripture did not stop there. He put he put uh h a clause for us to continue to appoint unto them that moon in Zion. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Zion is the city of David. Zion is a choosing city. So a type a choosing people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that mourn in Zion, she's a type of the bride to give unto them beautyful arches. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so that is the thing where most of the time when I when I talk about this, I like to make emphasis on because the acceptable year was already preached by Jesus. And those that believe the acceptable year message, they got the jubilee. Pentecost was the jubilee. &gt;&gt; Pentecost was the fulfillment of Jesus acceptable year message because the acceptable year is the jubilee. Pentecost fulfilled that &gt;&gt; our part the benefit that we supposed to get when we identify &gt;&gt; the second sin is this we must get beauty for arches. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does that represent? Everything that we go through &gt;&gt; all everything that we go through &gt;&gt; we we will come out better. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Everything we go through, you take the burnt offering, the ashes was put into into a water consecrated and it was used for the purification of the people. So as we trust the Lord, as we hold to his word, we don't understand it. We we we I mean uh God has given us grace to to follow his word. The scene where brother Brandon could not understand why the is stuck together and and and and he didn't even know what was happening. God has wrote the scene. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So everything that we go through there are some we will never see it in this life. We will not see it on this side. You will not see the beauty of what you are going through on this side. But he promised to give you beauty for your aches. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, so don't hold yourself back to be burned. &gt;&gt; Put yourself like a burnt offering on the altar and say, "Lord, burn everything of me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I know when it come to be beautiful. &gt;&gt; Burn my toss. Burn my desire. Burn my selfishness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Burn my human nature &gt;&gt; because I know when it come on the other side, it's going to be beautiful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He promised to give us beautiful arches. Oh, I love this. &gt;&gt; And the oil of joy for morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Weeping might endure, but joy comes in the morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that are mourning and groaning in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel, that's why the Bible says that that the the man with the with the ink horn, he was looking for those that were weeping for the abomination of the setting. &gt;&gt; So, he gave us an oil of joy, which is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we learn to cry for the abomination that is done in the setting, we learn to cry for what is happening in our church, what is happening in our home, what is happening in the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then he give you an oil of joy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It does not end there though. He give you the garment of praise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the spirit of heaviness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When when when when everything look depressing, &gt;&gt; there's a song of joy that comes up in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise. He gave you a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness to lift up your spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the benefit of receiving the second portion. &gt;&gt; When you receive the message that has come of vengeance is vengeance on the word, but to the believer, it give you an oil of joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It turn your burning into beauty. Amen. your arches into beauty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it give you a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can put on your garment of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When things look depressing and it looks hopeless, you can just wear your garment of praise. &gt;&gt; I will praise the Lord. No matter what tomorrow brings, &gt;&gt; you say, I will praise the Lord. Because you have on a garment of praise. It's not something that you wear. You wear it when you go to the word. Amen. It's a garment that is given to you from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You get the oil of joy from the word. &gt;&gt; You get the beauty of aches from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometimes the word comes, it burn you. It rebuke you. It cut you into pieces. Put you on the altar of God. &gt;&gt; And it looks like everybody is against you. &gt;&gt; But it's going to be beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be beautiful arches. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not the archers of the wicked. This one is the arches of the righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So he gave us a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. Then what the Bible says that they might be called a tree of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Planting of the Lord &gt;&gt; that God might be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's what this message supposed to do to us. &gt;&gt; It's not a cut. It's not a society just to join. &gt;&gt; It's here to burn you and turn your arches to but &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It gives you an oil of joy &gt;&gt; for morning. Even though you weep, but your face is always bright. &gt;&gt; Your face is always cheerful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give you an oil of joy. You're not walking with sighness and heavy face. &gt;&gt; You're walking with the joy of the Lord. And I ask you what's what's make you smile. Brother B said just like to that little brooks, you say little creek, what makes you happy? &gt;&gt; The water is always bubbling. What makes you happy? It's not coming from some kind of a water company. &gt;&gt; It's coming from under the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because God has set the scene. The scene is already set. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you people, the scene is set. And you can't bypass the scene. &gt;&gt; If you are called to play, &gt;&gt; God will make sure that your members cease. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. for whatever part he want you to play because the scene is set. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; William Brandham could not bypass it. &gt;&gt; Demon Shakara could not intervene because he was it was not an ordinary man that gave Jesus the word. It was a priest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God has set the scene. &gt;&gt; Everything that is happening around us is right in the word. God has set the scene. When you say peace, peace, suddenly come destruction. &gt;&gt; Everything that is around us, the scene is already set. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your wishful thinking is not going to change it. &gt;&gt; It's not going to change it. &gt;&gt; The devil can do enough to frustrate you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can do enough to frustrate you. &gt;&gt; And you say, "No, I'm tired. I I might give up with this thing. I'm tired with it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm tired with faith. I can I can I mean I'm serving God. There is no change in my life. And you are just You have to remember your promise is &gt;&gt; beautiful arches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful arches. Amen. &gt;&gt; All of our people that is just running after prosperity, gospel, you know, we have suffer, you know, this is our time to enjoy and and and all of that. Look, God will bless us in different areas of our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will bless us. God can make this city, he can make this city peaceful &gt;&gt; just because they are his devoted, committed, dedicated children. &gt;&gt; And that is the reason why, you know, I was making emphasis on what I was making up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The economy can go by &gt;&gt; but because you have got God on the books. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You having God on the books. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says when you pay your t I will open the windows of heaven. &gt;&gt; God can bless that company that you are working for just because of you because you have God on the books. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The the economy can go by everybody will see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It will test you one way or the other. But not pressing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. not pressing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When we come on the this this this second portion of the of of of of the scene that is set here, when we come all of these things, just just read the rest. Read the rest. You see, even the Gentiles, we are all part of this second portion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Read the rest of chapter 61. It just does not stop on on verse two. &gt;&gt; Many time we preach it, we just stop it on verse two. Read the rest of what is written there. You will see that even the Gentiles are brought in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse verse six. But ye shall be named the priest of the Lord. And that's what we are. We are king and priest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Men shall call you the ministers of our God. Yeah. shall eat the riches of the Gentiles and in their glory shall ye boast yourself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's all these promises that comes on the second fulfillment of this. This second fulfillment comes from Jesus's ministry all through the church ages and then it goes back to the Jews. this second part. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because the the the the message of virgins was preached by Malachi 4 and it's the same message that would go to the Jews, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So this second portion goes through the gentile through the church ages and it goes to the Jews. &gt;&gt; So just just think about it. All of these years from the time Jesus was here, all these years it's just in this in this uh uh chapter this chapter 61 of uh 11 verses from that day that Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled. Each one of these verses has been playing out &gt;&gt; in history. Each one of these verses has been playing out. It play out right into verse two. That was that was Jesus's ministry when brother Brandon came. Then the rest of it start playing out because he was supposed to fulfill the half of verse two. &gt;&gt; So God set the scene. Everything of our life is in one of these verses or another through this book. Are we together? &gt;&gt; You cannot follow it verse by verse. &gt;&gt; It does not explain your life verse by verse. That's the scene we were in. Revelation chapter 5. That's the scene we were in with Revelation chapter one. Brother Brand say it's not a verse by verse fulfillment.
