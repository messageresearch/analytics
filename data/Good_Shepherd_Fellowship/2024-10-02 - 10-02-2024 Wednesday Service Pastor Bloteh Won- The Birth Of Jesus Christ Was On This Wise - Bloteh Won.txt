another privilege to be here praise the Lord sister Nai we want to say happy birthday again praise the lord we want to thank God for for giving you a full Edge let's say that way praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord the Lord has been good to us and uh and thank you all too for sending your birthday wishes and text messages and we we are grateful yeah use that for now the Lord bless you you may have your seat and uh praise the Lord amen praise the Lord you know uh we we spoke uh sometime back on from Revelation chapter 5 and uh uh and we mention that when the seals were open uh beside the names of the redeemed there were that were beside the redeem no let he stay right here for now yeah beside the names of the redem that were revealed we saw another thing in Revelation chapter 5 and uh and what we saw in Revelation chapter 5 was uh the prayers of the Saints and uh uh the Bible says there was a board there was a board with uh the prayers of the Saints and uh like I said uh it makes the importance of prayer to the believer to realize that uh every time we say a prayer is gathered in a place of remembrance so uh uh because of that and uh we try to bring the the the emphasis to be able to encourage ourself there is one thing that we can do and never be out of order is when we are praying the Bible says is in season is out of season so we can never be out of order and the last time we spoke about the uh the in home writer and and that in writer was sealing those that was praying for the Abomination that is done in the city now this is it is not just to make Aon title but it is to be able to encourage us and also to be able to teach us praise the Lord that when we come to the to the house of God and uh uh uh it we we are encouraged to be able to bring a burden bring a bring a prayer need for someone and some even if it's an unspoken prayer request because one of the things that we learned prayer is a burden praise the Lord amen we must never come to a prayer meeting and start creating request about what what do we need to pray about okay okay let's let's pray for the brothers and uh okay okay let's pray for the Sisters no no prayer must come from a place of Burden praise the Lord amen amen that's that's what we have been taught that's what make us different from a denomination because it's easy to create a prayer meeting and we can do it just the denomination way praise the lord we all have a need for us to pray about tonight then I make you you startop thinking about it then this person talk then that person talk talk it's not coming from a place of Burden it must come from the place of Burden praise the Lord amen and then if it's from a place of Burden amen we we make it known by writing the prayer request sometimes if you have the burden send a text message we will be able to pray along with you and then we will we will we will write it down even though I don't want to to encourage them because people would now expect me to be writing their prayer requests and then they will say I told you but I didn't hear my prayer request it's truth that I supposed to carry your burden that one supposed to be special to you praise the Lord so we have few prayer needs we want to take up tonight and uh we just want to encourage you amen and I mean there there are just so many things happening in the world a lot of things happening around us we have people that we know that are in so much need someone wrote a prayer request tonight Shalom s Shalom there's a lot going on in Israel and I convert your prayers let's pray for the Peace of Jerusalem praise the Lord that is not something that must that must keep us praise the Lord because one thing isra stand as a Time piece for us and there is also a blessing that is attached

and then we start praying that we just so much atmosphere so much uh is this off check it there is just a lot of uh okay it's just so easy for Faith to to start to build and then we could just go on and on and on and then uh uh we we just get so caught up in his presence but we ask that you take these knes and and uh uh when you go into your closet and uh uh just remember them tonight so let's take Matthew chapter one Matthew chapter 1 we read this uh uh scripture on on Sunday Matthew chapter 1 we will read from Verse 18 Matthew chapter 1 we read from Verse 18 Matthew chapter 1 we will read from Verse 18 praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen amen now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise now that's that would be my subject tonight the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise if you remember on Sunday I re-echoed that over and over because I wanted to grab your attention on this the birth of Jesus was on this wise uh on on on this order this is the way that it happened and uh so I want to stay right there uh with their Tau praise the Lord amen if uh if the birth of Jesus was on this wise at that time you know what what is beautiful here about this scripture is that uh Matthew wrote it in a present tense now now now so in in every age to to every generation we can we can we can apply this scripture to ourself amen now the birth of Jesus was on this wise because the same way God did it the first time that's the way he's going to do it if he would bring Christ in in this age if he will bring Christ in your life the way he did it here that's the way he's going to do it praise the Lorden are you grabbing the the picture amen so the birth of Jesus was on this wise the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen let's continue to reading now the birth of Jesus was on this wise when as his mother married was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost you will realize that in the message brother brandham used this over and over most especially when he's talking about the godhead to be able to prove who was Jesus father he used it all the time you can just go right into the search and put the birth of Jesus was on this wise you will see how many times he mentioned it and every time he mentioned it he mentioned it to be able to show that there is nothing like Trinity pra praise the Lord and also to be able to show that uh how the how the birth that that God overshadow mared and the child that it was God giving birth to himself let me say it that way praise the Lord so he read the scripture and he says the Bible says here that uh uh uh before they came together she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost he said okay let's take that one is the Holy Ghost his father but Jesus said God was his father you know so he go on and on just to be able to bring us to the place to be able to understand that it was God dwelling the fullness of God dwelling in Christ amen so the scripture goes on then Joseph her husband being a just man now not willing to make a public example was mindful to put her away yeah brother Brandon we explain that they were married because of their vow but uh they had not consumed their marriage yet the consumation of the marriage never took place but they have proposed to one another to be husband and wife praise the Lord are we together now so what I want us to see here is there uh uh married she had her life going on praise the Lord she had her life planned or her wedding was planned she was she was on her expectation to be a mother she might have had in her mind how many child that she was going to have praise the Lord and that is the same thing with you and myself before God met us we have our life going on praise the Lord are we together the birth of Jesus was on this wise now you have to remember we read this on Sunday brother brandham said you ever get the Virgin birth straightened out you got Christianity straighten out praise the Lorden amen if you ever get the Virgin birth straightened out you get Christianity straighten out if we get the the that is just not Christianity as a religion but Christianity in the way that God is dealing with his people because it's not a religion it's a relationship amen praise the Lord are we together so the birth of Jesus was on this wise Mary had her life going on I mean she was a young woman and and I mean she had she had things planned Joseph there also was on her expectation to take this young young woman I call into history he has he he he lost his wife and this was going to be his second wife and uh uh they had everything planned praise the Lord the truth about the matter there is that they were not planning for this one this was not in their plan praise the Lord amen and with our life plan up we were not planning for this one amen praise the lord we were not planning to be onor honor a messenger of this age am I don't think any one of you went to school to learn how to be under a messenger of the age we were not planning for this what brought this to Mary was God's favor what brought this to you and myself is God's favor the birth of Jesus was on this wise praise the Lord if you can grab it you will realize that you are not in a picture to begin with you cannot plan this thing out praise the Lord you cannot plan out like you know some young people when I get married I will get the Holy Ghost when you know when I finish with school when you you can't plan it it's a finished work the blueprint is in the hands of God are you seeing the picture amen they were not pling Joseph was not planning for this but there was one thing that was also truth about Joseph the Bible says he was a just man praise the Lord hallelujah even though he was not planning for his wife to be visited by an Angel but but what he had in his plan that he would live by the law of God am praise the Lord am amen amen that until God brings him a faithful woman in his life he's not going to be running around and just living a useless life he was a just man that's what the Bible said and Mary was just an innocent girl that was uh I mean growing up and honor her mother and and and uh uh uh uh with this expectation of having her own home raising her own family that was her plan praise the Lorden and that is the same thing with you and myself that is the same thing with every predestinated child of God are we together if we get the Virgin birth straightened out our Christian Life will line up are we together see what brother Bram says here while we stayed on this thought he says you know and you know what after a survey was made according to the government statistics after the survey was made there was 70% of protestant preachers praise the Lord amen am I'm trying to wait for my folks to catch up back there and uh there are some new land back there so a whole lot of a thing is going on okay let's go ahead because I think uh they are projecting something different they want us to begin the service from from stratch praise the Lord you know what he says after a survey was made according to the government statistics this is the government religious statistics there was 70% of protestant preachers denied the Virgin birth that's trueu that was where zling was different from uh Luther he was also a reformer that came out of the Catholic church just like Luther but zling did not believe in the Virgin birth they believe that Jesus was the son of Joseph called the Son of God praise the Lord now you you will see why this is important because you see the thing about it there is not when we just say we believe it you will realize that what you believe actually affect your life praise the Lord it makes a big part of your life for the matter of fact it makes almost 80% of your decision making the choices that we make are we together so so he says here uh uh uh 70% of the protesting preachers deny the Virgin birth will you think of it no wonder we have hashed out 13 million in feter last year and that's the reason why the church is the way the church is because if we really believe the Virgin birth in the way the Bible taught it we will not need an organization can you imagine God about to bring forth the Messiah and he called caias and say call the sindr council yall come together and discuss how the Messiah should be born praise the Lord if we believe the Virgin birth we will not need an organization because God never did an organization to bring the Christ amen we will not need a denomination praise the Lord amen amen and brother Bram says no wonder we have a bunch of unbelievers in the church we have a bunch of people that claim to believe and deny the power of God what brought the Virgin bre it was the power of God the Bible says you will be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and If you deny the power of God then you don't believe in the Virgin birth no matter how much you think you believe in it if you have a situation in your life that you think that God is can is cannot take care of then you don't believe in the Virgin birth all this run very deep it runs very very deep I really didn't mean to tell you Bible stories my desire is for us to get somewhere so so he go ahead and he says here he says uh no wonder we have h h a bunch of infos last year see because th the fundamental part of Christian religion is based upon the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ is a fundamental part we can talk about Calvary without a virgin birth we can talk about a savior we can talk about Redemption praise the lord we might have a bunch of knowledge and and you know talk about mystery mystery mystery but it all start from the Virgin birth is a fundamental part and no wonder why the devil attack it praise the Lord amen If he if he was not born a virgin birth he was not the son of God praise the Lord amen he was not just called the Son of God to be called The Son of God he was the son of God because God birthed him praise the Lord he was the son of God because it was God's life in him and if if we are Sons and Daughters of God the same way the first son was born was birth it would be the very same way going about your normal business and God will grab your attention by a message and he will condition your life to be able to bring forth Christ hallelujah praise the Lord amen oh may God help us are we together the breath of Jesus was on this wise if if he was not the Son of God if he was born the Virgin birth he will have to be the Son of God not no other one could bring him here no other one could bring him here no other one could bring him here praise the Lord amen when God said in the beginning let make man in in our image and the Bible says in the image of God God make man male and female created he them praise the Lord that's what the Bible said are we together when God was bringing the first son he did not organize Angels praise the Lord he didn't went through some kind of organization the Bible says no the Bible says and God created Man In His Image male and female and the Bible says he took of the Dust of the earth he formed man and he breath into his nostril and Man became a living it was all God's work it was all God's work there was no mother and father that brought the first Son of God there was no mother and father that brought the Second Son of God there is there will be no parent that will bring a Son of God in this age it has to be God hallelujah praise the Lord it has to be God the birath of Jesus was on this wise how they God do it he caught the attention of a young innocent woman that have her life going on she made mistakes praise the Lord amen she made mistake maybe she was not educated as as as it was expected to be maybe she never had a career or she was hoping that that to them I mean what whatever her life was but God got her attention by an Angel that visited her praise the Lord and until God gets your attention in this age praise the Lord by the angel message of this age are we together amen praise the Lord amen as we go into this let me let me just uh uh let me just take a little backseat let me come back a little bit here praise the Lord you see when people sometimes it happen with visitors and uh uh you know we talk about you know a seed uh the womb and the woman and sometimes especially with the kind of for uh uh sensitive generation we have uh uh because the church has become everything it have just become a place of entertainment this kind of a language it it looks a little bit funny because as we go into today like I said on Sunday we're going to talk about the the two wombs and and all of that the reason is that we read Genesis 3:15 God gave a promise to the woman brother Braham said in uh uh invisible Union that the mystery of redemption was given to the woman with God's Plan of Redemption with God Plan of Redemption The Plan of Redemption that he had to be able to bring forth manifest his attributes the Bible will let us know that he put Adam into a deep sleep he took the woman and he formed the woman and in the woman he placed the mystery of redemption and that mystery of redemption was placed on the three sacred virtue praise the Lord no other creature was given there beside the woman and that's the reason why the church is a type of a woman praise the Lord amen amen amen so if we if we if we if we want to understand the way that God is dealing with his people we must go back and see how God deal with the woman praise the Lord because as the Church of the Living God we all come honor we come under that gender as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord amen amen glory be to God am me so let's let's continue here the birth of Jesus was on this wise there was a mered there was a Joseph praise the Lord and those people they were ordinary people just like you and myself uh uh like James would say the man of like passion praise the Lord but in the story year we we go down and the Bible would said in verse 20 but why he taught on these things why Joseph was thinking on these things the Lord appeared unto uh uh him in a dream came and said Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee marit the wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost the same thing that the angel said to Mary the angel is saying the same thing to Joseph praise the Lord amen God is trying to bring balance in this uh in this Union he's trying to bring balance in the people that he will be dealing with for this work Joseph had a place praise the Lord amen he had a place he's trying to bring balance and that's the way that God deal with us I mean the the preacher cannot be so scar high and he in the Blues and he's preaching and the people can never connect to what he's preaching God has to bring bring balance the same way he's dealing with the church he also dealing with the [Music] minister the birth of Jesus is on this Wise It's not a preacher there in the corner with some kind of assulated Revelation praise the Lord amen amen the way the Holy Spirit work is that what God will be dealing with your heart the things you will be praying about the things you will be Desiring God is going to lay the same burden on the ministry when you come to church he takes it from the word are we together amen and she shall and she shall bring forth a son and thou shall call his name Jesus for he will save his people from their sin verse 22 now this was done all this that have happened all this that have happened never happened randomly praise the Lord that's the reason why we are taught to breing bring our experience back to the word amen because God is not going to deal with you randomly he's not going to deal with you without no basis in his word all this was done the visiting of marriage praise the Lord all of that was done that it might be fulfilled yes that a word might be fulfilled praise the Lord amen amen we are here tonight all of this is done that it might be fulfilled in the evening time there shall be light praise the Lord is the evening light that is gathering us here amen amen amen we are gathering here that it might be fulfilled behold I send you Elijah the prophet to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers praise the Lord amen so we can we can take our experience back to the word all of this happen fulfill which was spoken by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted god with us so brother Brandon will use that to show that uh there are nothing like Trinity here there's no Father Son and the Holy Ghost here it's just God manifesting himself amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen the birth of Jesus was on this wise what did the angel said to Mary Hallelujah that will be found over in St Luke St Luke will bring us a more descriptive of this so let's go to Luke I want to just take one portion of that tonight so we can we can have something to meditate on something to take to the Lord in prayer praise the Lorden I'm telling you the way I'm looking at this I can preach all night but I will not try to do it amen yeah I will not I will not try to do it you love the Lord amen amen amen s Luke chapter 1 verse 26 in the sixth month in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God onto a city called Nazareth the city of gilee named Nazareth sorry to a virgin Asos to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the Virgin name was Mary praise the Lord amen the birth of Jesus was on this wise there was a time that Mary could say from that time amen amen the Bible was specific it was it was the sixth month of the year praise the lord and there will also bring in context where John the Baptist was amen amen so that was the age difference between he and and uh and Jesus 6 months now so h h h uh 6 months of the year now we can tell was Mary planning her wedding uh uh in the seventh month was she planning her wedding in the in the eth month or whatever time she was planning her wedding but here God will visit her in the six months the angel will come to a woman that was already engaged to a man and the angel verse 28 came to her and said hell thou are highly favored praise the Lord amen thou are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are th among women praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen and just like I said you know uh uh uh we we we look at the story here in the in the uh in the Bible and then we look at Mary condition the Bible say she was a virgin she was a young woman exposed to a man they never came together and sometimes we take there to be more extraordinary but a prophet will come and tell you that uh your natural birth was more mysterious than the Virgin birth praise the Lord which mean h h i mean uh year when you look both in the in the book of uh uh Matthew and and and Luke they trace the genealogy of both Mary and Joseph back to David praise the Lord amen both of them are traced right back to David we'll find we'll find time to do that will show you places there where where you can be able to see it now but what I'm trying to say here is there uh H I mean uh as a people of God I mean we are from we are from different background and and and some of our parents did not even knew about the message some of them were not were not Christians and and and all of that and and and and and so in in our human mind is it's it's hard for us to to think that we fit in this situation praise the Lord amen because when we remember uh H our past life and some of the things that that we that we did is hard for us to place our former life in the state of a virgin praise the Lord but I have good news for you tonight amen Allelujah praise the Lord I have good news for you tonight because I would tell you that uh Mary was not the only virgin that was in the city praise the Lord she was not the only virgin but she was the one that was choosing for this Mission amen she was the one that was choosing for this experience the birth of Jesus was on this wise and the angel said unto her thou are highly favored all that means is that Grace unto you that's what it means this is God's grace unto you for you to hear about the message of the hour to hear that God sent a prophet is God's grace unto you you are highly favored am praise the Lord highly favor more than Elon Marx praise the Lord oh you don't think about it that way but you are highly favored your name are never come on the name of the the the world most 10 rich people the world most five beautiful women the world most uh inter your name I never show up there but God choose you God says you are highly favored to bring the message of the hour your way to grab your attention something that will grab your attention in such an age of Reckless living and such an age where the name of God is traed to the ground yet God can put Grace in your heart and you can you can have respect to the word of God you can have some sense of decency amen amen amen the birath of Jesus was on this wise praise the Lord am and when she saw him she was troubled at this saying really trouble at they saying I don't know I don't know any one of you that were that trouble when you heard the message of the hour the first trouble there is that are we worshiping brother Brandon is he is he a man adulterine everything brother brandham said brother brandham say the first trouble there is there there I know some people struggle in the address code some people struggle with different things if if you really check your experience there was somewhere down the line where you were troubled when you heard the message there were somewhere down the line where you were troubled are we together the birth of Jesus was on this wise she was troubled at the scene and she cast in her mind what manner of salutation is this what kind of a church is this what kind of a message is this who is this man the talking about praise the Lord she cast in her mind until now some are still going through mind battles this doctrine that Doctrine is all casting in our mind the message has already come the angel has giving the message but now Mary is having mind battle what manner of Sal utation is this What doctrine is this what teaching is this are we together let's just read the Bible another time we will preach amen are you enjoying the word tonight am I hope you are and the angel said unto her fear not fear not Merit if there is one thing that God want to take from the church is fear praise the Lord if God can just take fear if he can just take fear amen if there is one thing that is plaguing the church is fear amen praise the Lord amen to realize that we come in the presence of almighty God We Believe that we are in the presence of the great omin poent and we can express ourself praise the Lord because we don't want to be Lo at strange we can't clap our hands we can't say Amen what is doing their fear praise the Lord even because of fear some people can't sing special praise the Lord they can sing special but when they are home singing Praise the Lord praise the Lord but I want to say to you tonight fear not fear not please come and sing special we will worship with you we will sing with you fear that for thou H has found favor with God that is the the most blessing that God can give any man for a mortar to find favor with God praise the Lord there is not think that anybody could do to change God's mind when he said David was a man after my own heart amen praise the Lord the Bible says before the two child were born God says I love Jacob he found favor with God it's not something that you can do to find favor with God is God's grace am it's his choice amen there is nothing you can do amen are we together you cannot impress him you can't impress him he's saying fear not fear not for thou has found favor with God praise the Lord I just wish we can stop there tonight and just talk about fear not you have found favor with God but that's not where I want to close tonight amen he says uh and now behold thou sht conceive in that womb and bring for the son and thou sht call his name Jesus we realize that down in verse 34 then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be saying I know no man praise the Lord amen now what I also want you to notice in this is that there's there's a conversation that is going on with Mary and the angel as the angel is dealing with her her heart she's finding a place of comfort to be able to talk back to the angel praise the Lord at the first she was in her mind she was saying what manner of salutation is this but now she can go back to the angel and say how would this happen praise the Lord and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power the power of the highest shall overshadow thee that's what I want to do tonight before we go home I will come back to this because uh that's that's what I'm I'll be preaching on uh uh this few time amen you know sometimes I take a subject we go and when we get a visitor they come and change everything then we have to we have to find something else again amen but don't worry the the the subjects are there I just need the inspiration of the Lord to go back to them praise the Lord now so the angel told Mary the Holy Ghost the power of God will overshadow you praise the Lord amen the power of God will overshadow you you know the best way to understand that the Holy Ghost is going to condition you amen for this birth for this experience praise the Lord the power of God is going to overshadow you the power of the highest the Holy Ghost will come upon you and the power of the highest is going to overshadow you praise Lord when you when you when you when you understand that and you think about it you think about the same way the same manner the same order that God brought himself in flesh is the same order that God is also using to bring himself back in flesh he brought himself in flesh in the bridegroom he's now bringing himself in in bringing himself in flesh in the bride amen and he's using the same order amen praise the Lord amen amen the Holy Ghost will condition you amen amen everything that you've been going through your trials your failures all of that that's the reason why the great Apostle Paul would say all things work together for good what is the good is God conditioning you Mary say how will this happen with all my past life and all my struggle how will it happen how will I be able to bring forth Christ how will the word be made flesh in me praise the Lord the angel never told Mary go to the temple and fast for 21 days the angel never told Mary you know you got to crawl on your knees you got to go back and confess to the priest the angel never told her that the angel said the Holy Ghost go Almighty will condition your body brother Bram said if he had to lay you down in the hospital he will do it it's God that will condition you no matter how stubborn you are God will condition you he made you he know the substance of your body he knows exactly what to do for you to surrounder Hallelujah

few things here and I'll let you go now amen you love the Lord tonight amen praise the Lord see what he says in Resurrection the message Resurrection he said Gabriel speaking the angel speaking the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and you are going to conceive and in your womb is going to come come for a blood cell and is going to develop into a Son of God it's not something you're going to
