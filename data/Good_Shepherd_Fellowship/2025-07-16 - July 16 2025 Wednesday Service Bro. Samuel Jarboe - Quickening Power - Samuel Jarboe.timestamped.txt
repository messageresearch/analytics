[27:14] leave anyone behind.
[27:17] So tonight, we just we just want to take
[27:19] few prayer needs here.
[27:21] And uh
[27:25] this knee came in

[49:33] &gt;&gt; It's a privilege for us to be back to
[49:34] church in the house of the Lord. Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; I believe there is no better place than
[49:40] the house of the Lord.
[49:43] David said, "I was glad when he said
[49:45] unto me, let us go in the house of the
[49:46] Lord." Sav said, "It is better to be in
[49:50] the house of the Lord than to be in the
[49:51] tent of the wicked."
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; So, I'm grateful to God for this
[49:57] opportunity to come in the midst of the
[49:58] believers
[50:00] uh to fellowship around God's word. I
[50:03] want to extend my greetings from the
[50:04] believers in Philadelphia.
[50:08] They ask me to extend the greetings and
[50:10] all great in the things of the Lord.
[50:12] Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Also want to extend the greetings for my
[50:17] wife, my family
[50:19] and also extend the greetings. Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Also want to thank the pastor for giving
[50:24] me this opportunity
[50:27] to come and share the word with us this
[50:29] evening.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; So I'm grateful to the Lord. Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; So I don't want to waste much of your
[50:35] time.
[50:37] We just go quickly into the word and see
[50:39] what they don't have for all this
[50:40] evening.
[50:42] Shall we stand to our feet?
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of God
[50:51] tonight?
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Shake your friend hand say God bless
[50:55] you.
[51:06] Amen.
[51:10] Let's go to the book of Genesis.
[51:13] We read
[51:24] the go book of Genesis chapter one.
[51:27] Amen.
[51:30] Excuse me.
[51:33] Genesis chapter 1:es 1 to 5.
[51:38] The scripture said, "In the beginning,
[51:40] God created the heaven and the earth.
[51:44] And the earth was without form and void,
[51:46] and darkness was upon the face of the
[51:48] deep.
[51:50] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[51:52] face of the waters.
[51:54] And God said, "Let there be light." And
[51:57] there was light. And God saw the light
[52:01] that it was good.
[52:03] And God divided the light from the
[52:05] darkness.
[52:07] And God called the light day and the
[52:08] darkness he called night. And the
[52:11] evening
[52:13] and the morning were the first day.
[52:16] Shall bow heads to pray.
[52:19] Our gracious Lord Jesus,
[52:21] we want to commit the word into your
[52:24] hand tonight. We pray you bless it. We
[52:27] sanctify God. May the word be alive in
[52:30] our house tonight. Lord, bless the word.
[52:32] Inspire us this evening. Bless the sons
[52:35] and daughters who are on the church and
[52:37] those who are here tonight. We pray you
[52:39] bless our hearts to your glory. In Jesus
[52:41] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[52:44] Shall be seated.
[52:48] Shall we go to the book of Romans?
[52:55] Amen.
[52:58] Let go to the book of Romans chapter 8.
[53:08] Romans chapter 8 11.
[53:14] Amen.
[53:18] Romans chapter 8 vers 11.
[53:21] The Bible say, "But if the spirit of him
[53:23] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelt
[53:27] in you, he that raised up Christ from
[53:29] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[53:32] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[53:35] you." Praise the name of the Lord.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; So tonight, I want to just encourage us
[53:43] a little exhortation.
[53:45] I want to speak on quickening power.
[53:47] Amen. Quickening power.
[53:50] The word quicken means to bring alive to
[53:54] make something get alive.
[53:56] Is to put life into something. When he
[53:58] say something is quicken is to put life
[53:59] into it to make it alive. You know
[54:02] that's what the word quickening mean. I
[54:04] want to read a quote from is the rising
[54:07] of the sun
[54:09] 3738.
[54:12] So we also read just keeping in mind
[54:14] what we read in Genesis. The Bible say
[54:15] in the beginning God created the heavens
[54:18] and the earth. And the Bible say the
[54:20] earth was without form and the earth was
[54:24] void. And the Bible says and darkness
[54:26] was upon the face of the deep and the
[54:29] Bible said and the spirit of God moved
[54:31] upon the face of the waters and God said
[54:33] let there be light and the Bible say and
[54:36] there was light. Amen.
[54:38] So we see Reban said he said there was a
[54:40] time when the world was laying out
[54:42] darkness. It was without form and was
[54:45] void and it was all covered with water.
[54:50] It was laying there in darkness glowing
[54:53] at the fear and the spirit of God moved
[54:56] upon the waters and said let there be
[54:59] light. God had a reason to do that for
[55:02] down believe the water there was seas
[55:05] that he had planted and he had to have
[55:08] that sunlight to make it alive. Amen. So
[55:12] in the beginning in Genesis when God
[55:13] said let there be light. The Bible said
[55:16] there was light and the Bible said the
[55:19] spirit of God move upon the face of the
[55:21] waters and and and and and God that
[55:24] light begin to push away the darkness
[55:27] but on the on the earth. The Bible said
[55:29] there were seas that were there. So it
[55:32] only took the light to strike the seed.
[55:35] So once the light was to strike the
[55:36] seed, it quicken that seed and make that
[55:39] seed to live. Amen. And the Bible say
[55:41] and B Brown say and the first light was
[55:43] ever given in the earth was God's spoken
[55:46] word. The first light that ever struck
[55:48] the earth was God's spoken word. He said
[55:50] let there be light and there was light
[55:52] that turn the darkness into light in
[55:54] order to bring forth a creation of joy
[55:57] and life upon the earth. So when when
[56:00] the when when God said let there be
[56:01] light and there was light that that
[56:03] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[56:05] waters though the earth was dark it was
[56:07] gloomy it was dismal but when the light
[56:10] struck the earth it push away the
[56:12] darkness and the Bible say there were
[56:14] seas in the earth praise the name of the
[56:16] Lord and because there were seas in the
[56:17] earth the seas in the earth were quaking
[56:19] by the light of God praise God so
[56:22] because that seas they were
[56:24] predestinated to life if there was
[56:27] nothing in them they could not be
[56:28] quickened
[56:29] So the light that was the light that
[56:32] came forth on the earth quen the life
[56:34] that was in the seed and that seed that
[56:37] were quaking were seeds that were for
[56:39] ordained by God.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Those seeds
[56:43] were for ordained by God. Listen brother
[56:46] said listen. He said he said oh my he
[56:49] said the predestinated one of course
[56:51] like the seeds laid upon the earth. The
[56:54] predestinated one are like the seed that
[56:56] lay in the earth. He said the one that
[56:58] had life in them, many of them were
[57:00] dead. They were just rotten seas, the
[57:03] water and things burned up. But you know
[57:06] there was a sea laying there ready to
[57:08] life. God know it was laying there. He
[57:10] said now as the sun was sent across the
[57:12] earth not to bring rocks which was dead
[57:16] also to life. It was not only to bring
[57:18] all the dead to life but was to bring
[57:20] the part of the dead which was closed
[57:22] around it. Listen very keenly.
[57:25] He said not all men will receive Christ.
[57:28] No. He said but those which God for
[57:31] ordeain to life is house around some
[57:36] sort of death of the earth. Listen very
[57:39] care. So God in the beginning when God
[57:42] spoke his word the predestinated sea in
[57:45] the dust of the earth was quaking to
[57:47] life. And brother Brown said those seas
[57:50] were seas that God for ordeain to life.
[57:54] And he said listen not all men will
[57:56] receive Christ. He said but those which
[57:58] go for to life is horse
[58:02] around some depth of the earth. So we
[58:06] are part of the earth. Praise the name
[58:07] of the lord. And he say and the one he
[58:09] comes to quaking they are the ones. So
[58:13] God's light that he that he struck the
[58:15] earth with could not quen all the seas.
[58:18] The seas that were quaking that were
[58:20] seas that were fall or deemed to life by
[58:22] God. And just around said the same
[58:25] thing. Said just like a man, the man is
[58:26] part of the earth. We are part of the
[58:29] earth. And as we hear the word, this
[58:32] same word quicken the seas in God's
[58:35] children who are fall orained to life.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; So if that life is not in you, you
[58:41] cannot be foreign. You cannot be
[58:42] quickened by the spirit of God. Praise
[58:44] the name of the Lord. Listen very
[58:46] keenly. He said, "Listen, Jesus said, he
[58:49] said, verily, verily, I say unto he, you
[58:51] that hear my word and believe on him
[58:52] that sent me have everlasting life and
[58:55] shall not come into this condemnation,
[58:57] but is pass from death unto life."
[59:00] Listen very keenly. He said when he
[59:02] received this Holy Spirit,
[59:06] he said that the dead on Pentecost there
[59:09] were the mechanics, not the d. And now
[59:11] the dynamics are come. He said and when
[59:14] you get a dynamics you have been quaking
[59:19] from mortality to immortality.
[59:23] Listen this mortal born we are living in
[59:27] not all can receive the word only those
[59:30] who go for orde to life. When a word is
[59:34] spoken, that word is the spoken word.
[59:36] That spoken word is the light. And that
[59:39] light that comes, it can only quicken
[59:42] those seeds that are for ordained by
[59:45] God.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; So that that is why not everybody can
[59:49] receive the word. Not everybody receive
[59:51] the word. only God's children who God
[59:54] first saw from the foundation of this
[59:56] world in his mind and he wrote their
[59:59] name on the lamp book of life
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; that those who are predestinated will
[1:00:04] receive the light of God they can be
[1:00:06] quaking by the word praise the name of
[1:00:08] the lord
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; so say he say when you get the dynamics
[1:00:13] you have been quaking from mortal to
[1:00:16] immortality
[1:00:18] he said it makes your whole body comes
[1:00:20] subject to the
[1:00:22] It makes you act different, look
[1:00:24] different, live different. It will just
[1:00:27] make you different.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So when you hear the word of God, you in
[1:00:32] this mortal body, when you hear the
[1:00:33] word, the word, the dynamics, the Holy
[1:00:36] Spirit comes and quicken the life in
[1:00:40] your mortal body.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; And when your life is quickened by God,
[1:00:45] what this what the quickening power does
[1:00:47] to you, B say it makes you are
[1:00:50] different. It makes you look different.
[1:00:52] It makes you live different. It makes
[1:00:54] you act different among your friends.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; That is the quickening power we are
[1:00:59] talking about.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; The book of Ephesians say, let's read
[1:01:01] Ephesians uh two. Let's read something
[1:01:03] in Ephesians chapter 2.
[1:01:06] Amen.
[1:01:09] Ephesians chapter 2. The Bible say and
[1:01:11] you are he quaking who were dead in
[1:01:14] trespasses and sin. So God quick his
[1:01:17] children who were dead in trespassing
[1:01:19] and sin. Go quicken them. If you're not
[1:01:23] part of the word, you cannot be
[1:01:24] quickened by God. The word of God is the
[1:01:27] light of God. You cannot be quickened by
[1:01:29] that word. Listen very carefully. And
[1:01:31] you had he quickened who were dead in
[1:01:33] trespassing and sin. Where he pass
[1:01:36] according to the cause of this world,
[1:01:38] according to the prince and power of the
[1:01:40] earth, the spirit that would now work in
[1:01:42] the throne of disobedience, among whom
[1:01:44] also we all had our confiscation in pass
[1:01:48] in the laws of our flesh. fulfilling the
[1:01:50] desire of the flesh and of the mind and
[1:01:53] were by nature the children of wrath
[1:01:55] even as others. But God who is rich in
[1:01:58] mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:02:01] loved us even when we were dead in sin
[1:02:05] have quickened us together with Christ
[1:02:08] by grace ye are saved. So when we're
[1:02:10] dead in sin, following the things of
[1:02:13] this world, enjoying the pleasure of
[1:02:14] this world after the loss of the flesh,
[1:02:16] the loss of the eye and the pr of life,
[1:02:18] the Bible say God who who has reaching
[1:02:21] mercy, who foresaw his strength from the
[1:02:23] foundation of the world, God came and
[1:02:26] quickened us from the deadness of sin.
[1:02:29] Amen. Where in trespassing and sin and
[1:02:32] God came and quicken us and brought us
[1:02:34] back to this word. That is why when we
[1:02:35] hear the word soon strike you when you
[1:02:38] hear the word that is why when the word
[1:02:41] is being preached and the word is not
[1:02:43] have impact on you begin to check
[1:02:45] yourself because all God's sons who God
[1:02:48] for the foundation of the word when they
[1:02:51] hear this word the word has impact in
[1:02:53] your life
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; if he coming to church every day and we
[1:02:58] reading the word and we hearing the
[1:02:59] preaching and the word cannot have
[1:03:01] impact into our life then there's
[1:03:04] something wrong with us.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; There is no child of God when yet this
[1:03:09] word and cannot respond to the word.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God, there is
[1:03:14] something in you that can respond to
[1:03:16] this word
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; because there is a deep in you that
[1:03:21] responding to that deep core of the
[1:03:23] word.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; So when God speak his word, he shouldn't
[1:03:26] be the word and they are quickened by
[1:03:28] the spoken word.
[1:03:30] So that quickening power quicken the
[1:03:32] word in you and make the word alive to
[1:03:35] you.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Listen. And brother say you were once
[1:03:40] dead in sin and trespasses and darkness
[1:03:43] and he quickened by what? His spirit
[1:03:46] that raised up Jesus.
[1:03:48] His spirit that raised up Jesus quicken
[1:03:51] you. He's going to eat money from the
[1:03:53] dead. He said, "And if it dwells in your
[1:03:55] mother body, he said, now watch, it also
[1:03:58] quaking brings to life makes it subject
[1:04:03] to the word."
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; So if you are the word, the word will
[1:04:08] always quen God's children. And it's
[1:04:11] only God's children can respond to you
[1:04:14] to the word. Church, the quaking power
[1:04:16] is not hidden somewhere. The quickening
[1:04:18] power is in you and myself.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; It is not somewhere else. The quickened
[1:04:23] part is dwelling in you. That is why the
[1:04:26] Bible said if the spirit that dwell in
[1:04:28] Jesus dwell in your dwell in you, it
[1:04:32] shall quicken your mortal bodies.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible say if the spirit that dwell
[1:04:39] in Jesus that quicken from the dead, if
[1:04:42] that spirit dwells in you, it shall
[1:04:44] quicken your mortal bodies. Praise the
[1:04:46] name of the Lord. Brother said now
[1:04:48] notice we are close. Notice he said
[1:04:50] listen this little seeds lay in the in
[1:04:52] the ground. He said now potentially you
[1:04:56] are resurrected.
[1:04:58] You are resurrected when you receive the
[1:05:01] Holy Spirit in you. You are resurrected
[1:05:04] right then. He say you your body is
[1:05:07] potentially resurrected.
[1:05:10] Listen the quickening power comes by the
[1:05:12] Holy Spirit come the life of the
[1:05:13] believer.
[1:05:15] But we receive the Holy Spirit. We are
[1:05:18] potentially resurrected. You know why?
[1:05:20] Because just like a man who want to buy
[1:05:22] bread in the stove.
[1:05:24] He does not have the bread, but he has
[1:05:26] the purchasing power of the bread, the
[1:05:27] money in his hands. So potentially the
[1:05:30] man has the bread in his hands because
[1:05:31] he has the purchasing power. So it's the
[1:05:34] same way if you have gospel in you
[1:05:36] potentially
[1:05:38] potentially say you are resurrected also
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; because why? You have the quickening
[1:05:45] power dwelling in your soul.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Really resurrected he said but also you
[1:05:54] are potentially the rapture.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; We have to quicken the power.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:06:02] Amen.
[1:06:05] Listen very carefully. Say what the
[1:06:06] quickening power does. He said but all
[1:06:08] of a sudden all of a sudden a dynamics
[1:06:10] comes. He said what did they do? It not
[1:06:13] only filled their spirit inside, but it
[1:06:15] quickened their mechanics, their body.
[1:06:18] Their bodies were quickened. They were
[1:06:20] no more cowards. They were just right
[1:06:22] out in the face of the people. That's
[1:06:24] what a quickening power can do to life
[1:06:26] of a believer. And Peter spoke, he said,
[1:06:28] "Yeah, men of Judea." He said, "You that
[1:06:31] were in Jerusalem, Jesus." When Peter
[1:06:33] got a quickening power on him on the day
[1:06:35] of Pentecost, Peter was no more afraid.
[1:06:38] He said right in the face of the people
[1:06:39] he said yeah men of Judea you that dwell
[1:06:42] in Jerusalem
[1:06:44] said where before the dynamics come they
[1:06:47] were just mechanics you see he said yeah
[1:06:50] men that dwell in Jerusalem let this be
[1:06:52] known unto you and hacking onto my word
[1:06:55] these are not drones as he supposed he
[1:06:58] said no this is that was spoken by the
[1:07:01] prophet Joah that it shall come to pass
[1:07:04] in the last days I will pour my spirit
[1:07:06] upon all flesh
[1:07:08] He says see the dynamics come into the
[1:07:11] mechanics. Are you getting the word?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; The dynamics come into the mechanics.
[1:07:16] They wasn't afraid no more. What
[1:07:18] happened to them? He said it changed
[1:07:20] them. It quickened them. It make them
[1:07:23] different. They were changed people
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; from there on. It quickened them from
[1:07:29] their old life of being a coward to like
[1:07:33] the lion of the tribe of Judah. That is
[1:07:36] what the quickening power can do in the
[1:07:38] life of a believer.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; When we receive the quickening power
[1:07:42] that the word is made alive to us in our
[1:07:45] life, it take all cowardness from our
[1:07:48] life. Then we cannot be ashamed of the
[1:07:51] gospel we are hearing.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] He said listen he said he said they
[1:07:58] absolutely face martyrdom in the dark
[1:08:00] ages the believer face madom. They were
[1:08:01] killed they were n on the cross. He said
[1:08:04] they were crucified up and down. They
[1:08:05] were burned. They were throw in the
[1:08:07] lines. Then he said because why? They
[1:08:09] were no more cowards because they had a
[1:08:10] quickening power. And then he said death
[1:08:13] had no victory over them at all. He said
[1:08:16] why the dynamics was in the mus. Yes
[1:08:20] sir. It quen their motor bodies.
[1:08:24] That is why when when Paul got to
[1:08:26] revelation and he was his life was
[1:08:29] changed. He received the quaking power.
[1:08:32] When Paul gathered to death, he said,
[1:08:33] "Oh death, where is your sting?" He
[1:08:36] said, "Oh grave, where is your victory?"
[1:08:38] Because the sting of death, Jesus took
[1:08:42] the sting of death.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; That is why a believer is no more afraid
[1:08:46] of death. Death is only a gateway to the
[1:08:48] soul.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; We are not afraid of death, church.
[1:08:51] Because why? We have the quickening
[1:08:52] power living in our mortal bodies. Amen.
[1:08:55] Praise God. Listen very keenly. He said,
[1:08:58] "Listen, he said it quickened their
[1:09:00] language." That's what the Bible said.
[1:09:02] "And their morts were been quaking.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Their language was quaking. Their
[1:09:07] thoughts were quaking. Their spirits
[1:09:09] were quaking. Their life were quaking
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; by the quickening power. They were
[1:09:14] quaking all together." He said they
[1:09:17] tried to talk and couldn't talk any more
[1:09:20] human language. They were so quaking up
[1:09:22] in the presence of God that they spoke
[1:09:25] in new tongues and heavenly language
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; because why church? They had the quaking
[1:09:31] power we are talking about
[1:09:34] church. That is why the word should have
[1:09:35] impact in life of a believer. If we are
[1:09:38] coming to church and the word is not
[1:09:39] having impact in our life then there's
[1:09:41] something wrong with our Christian
[1:09:43] experience. The word should have impact
[1:09:45] in life of the believer. That is why if
[1:09:47] we hear the word the word comes to
[1:09:49] correct us. The word that we hear Jesus
[1:09:53] Christ say he said the word has spoken
[1:09:54] unto you their life and they are spirit.
[1:09:56] So the word had to be quicken to
[1:09:58] believers. That is why church we can't
[1:10:00] keep solving the problems. The only
[1:10:02] problem we can do the only thing we can
[1:10:03] do to find solution to our life is to
[1:10:06] speak the word.
[1:10:10] It is the word that bring us together.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; It is the word that solve our problem.
[1:10:15] If you have a marital problem, it's the
[1:10:16] word that can solve your problem.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Because if the word is spoken to you and
[1:10:20] the word is not working to you, it
[1:10:22] cannot help you. Church, the pastor
[1:10:24] cannot even help you. It is the word
[1:10:27] that can help all of us.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; So if the word is spoken and the word is
[1:10:31] not working on your life, church, it can
[1:10:34] never help you. Because church, the
[1:10:36] pastor is not even speaking his own
[1:10:37] word. He's speaking the word of the
[1:10:39] master.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; He's speaking the word of the master.
[1:10:44] Amen.
[1:10:47] Brown said the quaking power. He said
[1:10:48] what what happened? He said their
[1:10:50] thoughts were quaking. Their spirit were
[1:10:53] quaking. Their life were quaking. They
[1:10:55] were quaking all together. Listen
[1:10:57] church. He said the quaking power wasn't
[1:11:00] only in their soul but it was all over
[1:11:03] them. Not only their numbers come in to
[1:11:06] quaking, but it quakens the mechanic.
[1:11:08] You see what I mean? They were so
[1:11:10] quaking till their tones their tongue
[1:11:12] begin to speak another language. They
[1:11:14] were so quickened by the power of the
[1:11:16] resurrection of Jesus Christ until they
[1:11:18] laid their hands. They were so quaking
[1:11:20] with the quaking power till when they
[1:11:23] laid their hands on the sick, they got
[1:11:25] well.
[1:11:27] It quickened their mortal bodies. They
[1:11:29] were healed by laying on their hands and
[1:11:32] the spirit quaking their fellowship
[1:11:34] together with God. They they also were
[1:11:38] so quaking into the presence of God
[1:11:40] until when the person died and their
[1:11:43] soul had gone off it and call him right
[1:11:45] back to life.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; The quickening power we are talking
[1:11:48] about church.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; It is not only in the pastor.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; It is in every church member of church.
[1:11:54] That is why brother Brown say if you
[1:11:56] have the quickening power he said if a
[1:11:59] brother dies in the church or a sister
[1:12:00] die we can pray with that person and
[1:12:03] call your soul for eternity and come
[1:12:05] back to time
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; because the power is lie in you
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; it's not different person it's in you
[1:12:11] church
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; because the scripture said if the spirit
[1:12:15] that rest of Jesus from the dead dwells
[1:12:19] in our malice it can quicken us
[1:12:22] churchmen
[1:12:24] It can work quick into us. Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; That is what the brother was speaking
[1:12:31] last week. He talking about local to
[1:12:34] Jesus.
[1:12:36] Bre five supernaturals that the five
[1:12:38] supernatural things that came out of the
[1:12:40] temple ministry.
[1:12:42] If you read local to Jesus, he said one
[1:12:46] brethren talk about preaching to the
[1:12:48] total loss. No matter what, no matter
[1:12:51] what, if they hear the word, they cannot
[1:12:52] repent from the word. Even if the word
[1:12:54] is preached to them, preach the total
[1:12:55] loss. That was one thing that came out
[1:12:58] ministry. Another triple ministry of
[1:13:01] speaking squ into existence.
[1:13:04] When brother spoke the word, go to him
[1:13:06] and he spoke the squirre
[1:13:09] pass and he spoke the squirrel into
[1:13:10] existence.
[1:13:12] But when B Brown went to the life, the
[1:13:15] house of Sister Hy, right? And it was
[1:13:17] some of the supernatural events that
[1:13:19] happened in the woods, in the forest or
[1:13:21] in the jungle, that word was speaking,
[1:13:24] it got quaking to sister, right?
[1:13:27] And when the word was quaking to her,
[1:13:29] the word became a reality.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And she said to Barb, said, he said,
[1:13:33] "What you say is true?" Because the word
[1:13:36] go quick to her.
[1:13:39] And when she says true say it right, he
[1:13:42] said ask what you want and God will give
[1:13:44] it to you.
[1:13:46] He said God will give it to you. And she
[1:13:49] was crying said brother what can I ask
[1:13:50] for? Bre said oh sister hit it right
[1:13:53] your parents are all. He said if you
[1:13:55] speak the word go will change that body
[1:13:57] and make that young couple again. But
[1:14:00] say sister hit it right could not speak
[1:14:02] that word for her parents. He said if
[1:14:04] she has spoken the word for her parents
[1:14:06] or parents could get young but they will
[1:14:07] still get old and die.
[1:14:09] And she was said, "What can I ask for?"
[1:14:12] Sister, your sister is scrippled. She
[1:14:14] have been here for years. He said, "If
[1:14:15] you speak the word," he said, "God will
[1:14:17] heal." But he said, "Even if God would
[1:14:20] have heal of a of of of a situation, she
[1:14:23] would have said God, she possibly should
[1:14:25] get crippled one day."
[1:14:27] But church, when the world got into it,
[1:14:30] right,
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; she spoke for the salvation of her
[1:14:33] children.
[1:14:37] Because church is the only thing we can
[1:14:38] ask for in this life is for our soul
[1:14:41] salvation.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Church, if we ask for material things,
[1:14:49] the material things will finish.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; If we ask for riches, it will finish.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; But if we ask for the soul salvation of
[1:14:58] our home, of our family, of our
[1:15:01] children, of our brothers and sisters,
[1:15:03] it will bring forth food of repentance.
[1:15:05] Our soul salvation is very important in
[1:15:08] the eyes of God.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; That is why church we need to claim our
[1:15:12] for the blood and our children must pray
[1:15:15] that God will open their eyes to the
[1:15:17] spoken word.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; The spoken word to be quickened to us.
[1:15:25] That is why church I'm tell you people
[1:15:27] say I'm boing the message. Nobody is
[1:15:28] boring message.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Nobody's boing message. Your children
[1:15:32] are not believers.
[1:15:34] Your children are unbelievers.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; There is nothing God bing the message.
[1:15:39] Oh, my child is boing the message. My
[1:15:41] child is Nobody is boing the message.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; The message must be boring us
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; to change our life.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; The message was bing us must receive the
[1:15:51] word. Your child must receive the word.
[1:15:53] Your son must receive the word. God
[1:15:55] doesn't have grandchildren.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; We all know it. God doesn't have
[1:15:58] grandchildren.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; The word has to be quaking to our sons
[1:16:02] and daughters. Our children must be
[1:16:04] quickened by the word. If the word does
[1:16:06] not have impact on our children, it will
[1:16:07] do them no good.
[1:16:10] We want to make our children believer us
[1:16:12] overnight. Our children are not
[1:16:14] believers. No,
[1:16:16] they are struggling because they were
[1:16:18] born and they met us living on life.
[1:16:19] They don't even understand it.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; They are forced to come to church. They
[1:16:24] are forced to sing in the song.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; They are we are constraining them to
[1:16:27] follow us. We don't some of us don't
[1:16:29] even want our children to even play
[1:16:30] church. Let children be children.
[1:16:35] We try to make children older people.
[1:16:37] That's why when they come, they get so
[1:16:38] tired of the church.
[1:16:40] We have to keep praying for our children
[1:16:43] until God can open eyes to the word.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Or as church, they only pleasing us.
[1:16:50] They only come to church to please us.
[1:16:53] That is why daddy mama is no more dead.
[1:16:54] They will start doing what they want to
[1:16:56] do.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; My child born in me. My child born. No
[1:17:01] child born in the message.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; They were all born sinners.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; They need to know God for themselves.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Listen brother said listen. He said
[1:17:15] quaking your m bodies. They were healed
[1:17:17] by the laying on the hands. He say and
[1:17:20] the spirit quaking their fellowship
[1:17:22] together of God till they also were so
[1:17:25] quaking into the presence of God until
[1:17:28] when the person die and their soul had
[1:17:30] gone off it call him right back to life
[1:17:34] again. Glory to God. Praise the name of
[1:17:37] the Lord. Because why the quickening
[1:17:40] power affect the life of a believer?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; If the quickening power cannot affect
[1:17:45] our life, where's the we come to church?
[1:17:49] If this what we are hearing it cannot
[1:17:50] have impact on us
[1:17:53] then something wrong with us
[1:17:58] because church children of God want to
[1:17:59] hear the word they want to straighten
[1:18:01] your life up you cannot be a child of
[1:18:03] God hearing the word and you cannot
[1:18:05] straighten your life up then there's
[1:18:07] something wrong with your gene
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; there's something wrong with your origin
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; any child of God said he said if a man
[1:18:16] is desiring to straighten his life. He
[1:18:19] said it's a sign that God is dealing
[1:18:21] with that person.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; If you if you in this church, if you go
[1:18:26] home, the spirit of God cannot speak to
[1:18:28] you. If something is not in you to
[1:18:30] straighten your life, you have to check
[1:18:32] your Christian experience.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; All of us here, if we hear the word and
[1:18:37] the word is not doing something to us
[1:18:40] because Jesus is working on his church
[1:18:42] every day of his life,
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; he's working on us. He's bringing us to
[1:18:48] the place of perfection. Church,
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; God for 6,000 years has been working on
[1:18:55] his church.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; That is what we don't understand.
[1:19:00] Church, look, marriage is not a fairy
[1:19:03] tale story
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; that the king son and the king daughter
[1:19:08] or the king son somebody live together
[1:19:09] for the rest of life happily. It's a
[1:19:12] it's a fairy tale.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Marriage is a school of character.
[1:19:18] Every day we learn in our marital life.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Every day there are things we not our
[1:19:22] marital life.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; It is not a fairy tale church. We are
[1:19:27] mistaking the church. It's not a fairy
[1:19:29] tale.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Listen brother the message. He said on
[1:19:35] the Easter Sea he said now the Easter
[1:19:37] Sea. He said now but when they he said
[1:19:40] now when they they went up to Pentecost
[1:19:44] he said there they received the quaking
[1:19:46] power the power that make them alive. He
[1:19:50] said that all things what does it do to
[1:19:52] our mortal bodies? Its our opinion it
[1:19:56] change our notion. It set our affection
[1:19:59] on things which are above.
[1:20:03] The quickening power that we are talking
[1:20:05] about that is in you and myself is set
[1:20:08] our desire on things above.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Nothing's here.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; That is what Paul said or the epistle
[1:20:15] said. He said nothing can separate us
[1:20:18] from the love of God that is in Christ
[1:20:20] Jesus.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; He said no depth, no height, nor
[1:20:23] principality, no powers can separate us
[1:20:25] from the love of God that is in Christ
[1:20:28] Jesus.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; It cannot separate us church. Because
[1:20:32] why? The word is make alive to us.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; The word is make alive to us.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Rean said listen. He said and you are
[1:20:44] quaking and this quaking power brings a
[1:20:47] body into a rapture
[1:20:50] condition.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Church. The quickening power
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; can bring a believer body into a rapture
[1:20:57] condition.
[1:20:59] That means potentially
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; you are raptured already.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; We are only waiting for a transformation
[1:21:06] of our bodies.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; But potentially we are raptured.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; We are in a rapturing state. Church
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; potentially.
[1:21:16] We are raptured.
[1:21:19] Listen very keenly. I like this. He
[1:21:22] said, "And you are quaking and death
[1:21:25] quaking in power brings your body into a
[1:21:29] rapture condition already."
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; So potentially we all raptured.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; That is why church one day we'll be
[1:21:41] walking we receive our translation
[1:21:43] because we are rapture already church.
[1:21:45] I'm not telling you a story.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you a reality.
[1:21:53] Re notice the Pentecostal people up
[1:21:56] there when they got quickened by the
[1:21:58] Holy Spirit. Listen to me. When those
[1:22:00] Pentecostal group group up there on the
[1:22:04] day of Pentecost receive their abstract
[1:22:07] deeds from God.
[1:22:10] When you get a quickening power, you
[1:22:12] receive your abstract title deeds.
[1:22:15] Abstract mean you cannot see it but you
[1:22:16] possess it.
[1:22:19] You you we we we cannot live honor
[1:22:21] privileged life as Christian.
[1:22:24] You have your a
[1:22:26] DS you can tell the devil to leave this
[1:22:29] place because you own it.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; It's for you.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; You're a
[1:22:36] every promise of the word God gave it to
[1:22:39] us for our possession.
[1:22:42] Everything that God say in this world
[1:22:45] say our pro our problem is we are living
[1:22:47] honor privileged life
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; we don't even know who we are
[1:22:53] you do one thing you come out of square
[1:22:56] one today Christian tomorrow you
[1:22:58] believer today you ready for rapture
[1:23:00] tomorrow you not ready for the rapture
[1:23:02] no
[1:23:03] every day see yourself as a conqueror as
[1:23:07] a victor
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; don't see yourself as are defeated
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; every day of your life. See yourself as
[1:23:15] your victor,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; as your conqueror.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; We are not defeated, church.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; You are a child of God. Tell I'm a child
[1:23:24] of the king.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; You have the gene of God in you, church.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; You have the quickening power in you,
[1:23:32] church.
[1:23:35] If the spirit that dwell in Christ
[1:23:38] dwells in you, it shall quicken your
[1:23:40] mortal bodies.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; That power is in you, church. Don't look
[1:23:46] for that power anywhere. It's really in
[1:23:47] you myself.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:54] And so quaking their bodies till they
[1:23:58] couldn't even speak in
[1:24:01] the language anymore.
[1:24:03] It quickened their body to a heavenly
[1:24:06] language
[1:24:08] and in the place they were going to
[1:24:12] quickening power of God shook their
[1:24:14] mortal body. So their entire mortal
[1:24:17] language was transfigured
[1:24:19] transformed into immortal language. What
[1:24:22] a quickening power. What something that
[1:24:25] belongs? He said, "If the spirit that
[1:24:27] raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in
[1:24:31] your mortal body, it shall also quicken
[1:24:33] them by the power of the living God."
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; That is why said when Elisha the prophet
[1:24:40] died, he said is the both of him is
[1:24:44] still had a quaking power.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Church, death can change us.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; We're all redeemed by God already.
[1:24:53] Elisha the prophet the power we are
[1:24:56] talking about it was in his bone
[1:24:59] his bone the power was in it was stay in
[1:25:02] it
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; that is why when Israel when they talk
[1:25:05] of man and they throw a man on the bones
[1:25:07] of Elisha
[1:25:09] they make him back to life
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; they make him back to life
[1:25:18] I'm not talking about different person
[1:25:19] I'm talking about you church
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; you what I said here I'm talking about
[1:25:22] I'm talking to you. I'm not talking
[1:25:24] about a different person. I'm talking to
[1:25:25] you. You have that power.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a different
[1:25:31] person. I'm talking about you.
[1:25:36] Jesus Bre said when Jesus want to go man
[1:25:40] the battle of win the battle of the
[1:25:41] mind. He f my law if it's away. He said
[1:25:44] let it pass over me.
[1:25:46] But God cannot die. God have to leave
[1:25:48] the body for the body to die because God
[1:25:50] cannot die.
[1:25:52] So when Jesus
[1:25:55] went to Calvary, he died. Rebrand say
[1:25:58] his soul went to hell.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; His spirit went to God.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; His body was in the grave.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; But Jesus was the originator of the
[1:26:06] quickening power.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus had to conquer death,
[1:26:11] hell, principality and power
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; to prove to us that the power is in him.
[1:26:17] It's in us
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; because God brought to understand that
[1:26:20] when Jesus died,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; the brow of Christ was in Jesus. Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; We're in Jesus.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; We're in Jesus. So if Jesus will
[1:26:31] resurrect will resurrect, the bride of
[1:26:33] Christ will have to be resurrected
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; because you are part of Jesus.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Church, you don't believe it. Listen,
[1:26:46] I listen it to you.
[1:26:50] I read from this message. Let me just
[1:26:53] read it so you see what I'm talking
[1:26:54] about.
[1:26:59] You find this in the message in two men
[1:27:02] said listen. He said, "Yeah, he goes."
[1:27:06] Why did he leave then? He left. The
[1:27:07] Bible said he has sinned. He went and
[1:27:10] preached to souls that were in prison
[1:27:12] and repented not in the long suffering
[1:27:13] days of Noah. His soul and spirit his
[1:27:16] steop of his own being went down. He
[1:27:20] said let's follow him a little bit. We
[1:27:21] like to tonight to follow me a few
[1:27:23] minutes. Let's see where he went. Just
[1:27:26] below the region of motor veins laid
[1:27:29] realms of demons. Amen.
[1:27:31] Church, we are fighting a battle. Amen.
[1:27:36] Just below the region of mine, there are
[1:27:39] demons power that exist.
[1:27:43] Amen. If you don't believe demon powers,
[1:27:45] there are demon powers existing.
[1:27:47] There is a living devil.
[1:27:51] There's a living devil we are fighting.
[1:27:53] In fact, we are fighting an enemy that
[1:27:55] we cannot see.
[1:27:57] You cannot see your enemy.
[1:28:00] But we use the word to conquer the enemy
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; if the word is spoken to us. Reb
[1:28:07] being lays the realms of demons power.
[1:28:09] Below just above there lays the souls of
[1:28:11] the unjust. Below lays the very domain
[1:28:14] of Satan hell. Then just above us lay
[1:28:17] the Holy Spirit. And on the altar under
[1:28:19] the altar lays the souls of the of the
[1:28:21] just man. The next is God himself. He
[1:28:24] said on going down and going upward. The
[1:28:27] two spirits are here on earth
[1:28:28] influencing the people of the earth.
[1:28:30] That's where influence everybody.
[1:28:32] The spirit of God and the spirit of the
[1:28:34] devil influence people on the earth. If
[1:28:35] you go down demons power, the religion
[1:28:38] of the just, the region of the unjust
[1:28:40] and sat on hell. But Jesus when he died,
[1:28:45] listen, when Jesus died, he went to the
[1:28:47] downward path
[1:28:49] because why Jesus took the sins of this
[1:28:52] world. So Jesus had to go to hell, the
[1:28:55] downward path.
[1:28:57] And when Jesus went down, he passed
[1:29:00] beyond the the the region of demon
[1:29:02] power. He passed beyond the region of
[1:29:04] the souls of the unjust. That when
[1:29:06] somebody's die on earth, Brown say if
[1:29:08] someone dies and they didn't give life
[1:29:10] to Christ. If someone die, they go into
[1:29:12] the region of the unjust. That's what he
[1:29:14] said. He said from there you see go to
[1:29:16] hell. But say it's not a place to go. He
[1:29:19] say if someone goes to hell, it's like
[1:29:21] taking a hot iron.
[1:29:23] in prison you put into a fire is hot and
[1:29:26] you pass it through the person ears say
[1:29:29] it will be more comfort to you to enjoy
[1:29:32] a hot anger passing through your ears
[1:29:33] than to go the downward path so that
[1:29:36] mean it's not a place to go it was meant
[1:29:38] for the devil his angel amen so Jesus
[1:29:41] went the downward path
[1:29:44] he went to the region of the unjust
[1:29:48] and Jesus went there and he knocked the
[1:29:50] door
[1:29:52] to the sodon jaws and open the door and
[1:29:57] he said, "I was the one that Noah spoke
[1:30:00] of. I was the one that Abraham spoke of.
[1:30:02] I was the one the prophet spoke of
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; but they could not hear his word."
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; That is why church when they get to
[1:30:11] realize it was a messiah because what
[1:30:14] came out of the temple was preaching to
[1:30:16] the unjust.
[1:30:18] So they could never be saved. Sorry to
[1:30:20] say.
[1:30:22] And Jesus reminded them of his own word
[1:30:24] that I am the fulfillment of the virgin
[1:30:27] birth.
[1:30:28] I am the sea of the woman. And he went
[1:30:31] on just and he told him I am here
[1:30:36] fulfilling his own promises by the word.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus went a downward path
[1:30:43] but because they could not be redeemed
[1:30:44] that door was shut. It was still there.
[1:30:49] The problem said Jesus went down to hell
[1:30:53] and went to meet the devil in hell.
[1:30:57] When Satan saw him, he said Satan said,
[1:31:00] "Oh, you are here." He said, "Yes, I'm
[1:31:02] here." He said, "But I told I
[1:31:07] say Satan has been trying to destroy
[1:31:10] that sea long time.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; He has been playing to destroy the
[1:31:15] promised sea.
[1:31:17] So he said I told him I better kill you.
[1:31:20] I told I prophet I kill you.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; But that was the king of glory sitting
[1:31:25] right in the presence of the devil.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And said read the story. Bre said and
[1:31:30] Jesus
[1:31:32] was the boss in hell.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; I want you to read that.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He said he was the boss. I want you to I
[1:31:38] want to read that. Listen.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:31:42] You see when the that sea was promised
[1:31:44] in the garden of Eden, the devil has
[1:31:47] constantly tried to destroy that sea
[1:31:52] and the death of Abra and the coming of
[1:31:54] said was just a death burial and
[1:31:56] resurrection of Christ. That sea must
[1:31:59] continue and he tried to destroy it. He
[1:32:03] said I thought I you when I destroyed
[1:32:06] I thought I you when I destroy the
[1:32:08] prophets. I was positive how you when I
[1:32:11] beheaded John. Satan was be constantly
[1:32:15] after that seed of the woman that one
[1:32:17] day was coming. So he was killing the
[1:32:18] people. They believe that line Satan was
[1:32:21] killing him.
[1:32:23] He said but now after all you have
[1:32:26] arrived Satan that is in hell.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Then he said I've got you now. I can
[1:32:30] hear him say Satan come here.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; He is the boss now.
[1:32:36] the master,
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; the one who has the quickening power.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; He was not in hell. And said he he is
[1:32:45] the boss now in hell.
[1:32:49] He said, "Here's the boss." Richard
[1:32:51] what? Grab the keys of death and hell.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; He went to Satan and he said, "Satan,
[1:32:57] give me the keys of death and hell."
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Give me the keys of death and hell.
[1:33:04] And Jesus took the key, kept set of the
[1:33:07] keys in there in hell
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; and took it and hanging on his side.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And he didn't stop there. When he took
[1:33:15] the keys of Satan said what he did, he
[1:33:18] step in hell more
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; and smash the door. Hell
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Satan has been shut up.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Smash the door. Took the keys.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:33:31] He reached out and grabbed the keys of
[1:33:32] death and hell off his side, hung it on
[1:33:35] his own side and he told I want to self
[1:33:38] notice on you. You are being a bluff
[1:33:41] roll enough be bluffing us.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; When the child see his elder brother and
[1:33:49] beating that child when the child see
[1:33:51] his brother child to have frisky
[1:33:54] tell I can beat you because why brother
[1:33:57] is there. So the child be playing
[1:33:59] frisky.
[1:34:01] Jesus save Satan notice in hell.
[1:34:06] He said notice
[1:34:12] Jesus have noticed you have been a blood
[1:34:14] fire alone. Jesus told said I am the
[1:34:17] vible son of the living God. My blood is
[1:34:20] still on the cross
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; and the full debt of sin has been paid
[1:34:26] church. Then
[1:34:28] he said, "You have no right no more.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; You are scraped."
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Get me those keys."
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; He turned around and gave him a healthy
[1:34:38] key.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus took the key.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; The keys of death and hell. He took a
[1:34:48] guess to kick kick Satan.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Not only kick but smash the door hell.
[1:34:57] and light the devil up.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:35:04] good healthy key and slam the door
[1:35:06] together
[1:35:08] and say stay in there. I am your boss
[1:35:11] from now on.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the boss.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; He's the boss.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Even hell, Jesus is the boss.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Church, don't you see? You are on the
[1:35:25] winning side.
[1:35:27] You have the power in you.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; You are on the winning side.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Script Satan of his of the keys or death
[1:35:37] and hell.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the boss.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; We are on the boss side. The boss.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Re says Satan is just a bluff. He has no
[1:35:50] He has nothing. He's just a bluff.
[1:35:55] This is where we end with this story.
[1:36:00] When Jesus took the keys,
[1:36:03] he say that to I'm your boss from now
[1:36:05] on.
[1:36:06] Now he didn't have the keys to the
[1:36:08] kingdom cuz he gave the key of the
[1:36:12] kingdom to Peter, right? to the church
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; that once we b heaven
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; but now he took another key from Satan
[1:36:21] the keys of death and hell
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; church you have the power in you listen
[1:36:28] to me
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; he has the keys in your hands you told
[1:36:33] the keys
[1:36:35] the key of heaven hell
[1:36:37] when Jesus went he have that key because
[1:36:41] he has to go to paradise
[1:36:45] to all the old testament sins that die.
[1:36:49] So Jesus took the keys and get out from
[1:36:52] hell and went into the realms of
[1:36:54] paradise where paradise was a place on
[1:36:56] earth in another dimension but the bl of
[1:36:58] boo and gold could not protect them.
[1:37:02] That's what demon power could penetrate
[1:37:03] the entire invoke the spirit of Samuel.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; But Jesus to Satan is a man blood is
[1:37:10] still on the cross.
[1:37:13] There's only a paradise now. We don't
[1:37:14] have paradise now. No.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; So Jesus went to paradise and knocked
[1:37:19] the door of paradise. Hook him up.
[1:37:22] Abraham Sarah came.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Who is knocking the door and start
[1:37:26] opening it? And Abra who is there? Abra
[1:37:28] said come come. He said this is the one
[1:37:31] that gave us the promise seed.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Job came to the door to spot. He said oh
[1:37:40] my redeemer live.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; My redeemer liveth.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Now he said those skin in this body yet
[1:37:48] in my flesh I shall see thy God.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; All the old testament sins Jesus open
[1:37:55] Eve all of them Adam all the old
[1:37:57] testament sins were there in paradise.
[1:38:00] And Jesus opened the door of paradise
[1:38:03] and said come with me and start walking.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say graves were open
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; because why the originator of the
[1:38:15] quickening power
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; has come to conquer death, hell,
[1:38:20] principality and powers.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; He has a power in him.
[1:38:27] all the Old Testament saints being the
[1:38:29] one with Jesus
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; and Abra and the rest of the of of the
[1:38:36] Old Testament sings
[1:38:39] they say want to see in the city of
[1:38:40] Jerusalem
[1:38:43] 40 days they were appearing and
[1:38:46] disappearing
[1:38:49] 40 days and Jesus told him I have to go
[1:38:51] and see my disciples
[1:38:54] to tell them I'm alive
[1:38:57] because I have to give them the sink
[1:38:59] quaking power to be in them.
[1:39:03] I'm alive.
[1:39:05] What the disciple told him? He said,
[1:39:07] "You have to go Jerusalem to receive the
[1:39:09] power from on high."
[1:39:12] And Jesus from there took the Old
[1:39:14] Testament sings to glory because they
[1:39:17] have to go and stay in the region of the
[1:39:19] just.
[1:39:22] And when the Old Testament sings, one of
[1:39:24] the angels shout, he said, "Open ye the
[1:39:26] doors, ye everlasting doors, and the
[1:39:28] king of glory shall come in."
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; And one of the angels shout said, "Who
[1:39:32] is the king of glory?"
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord strong and mighty,
[1:39:36] the Lord mighty in battle is the king of
[1:39:38] glory."
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Because the king of glory has con
[1:39:46] everything powers.
[1:39:49] He had the quickening power.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Reban said, "Listen,
[1:39:59] just I can see Daniel look over his
[1:40:01] shoulder and say, "This is the rock that
[1:40:03] was here on the mountain just as I'm
[1:40:05] standing here." I see Jo said, "This is
[1:40:07] my redeemer." I say, "I knew that live."
[1:40:09] And someday he will still upon the
[1:40:11] earth. Bamb may not be but a little
[1:40:16] small of arches but in 15 minutes from
[1:40:19] now I will be in again. Ezekiel over in
[1:40:23] the top and said I seen the same person
[1:40:25] as a we in the middle of the we went up
[1:40:28] in the middle of the air
[1:40:31] he said I saw him coming with 10,000 of
[1:40:33] his sins
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; all the old testament sins
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; there was old testament sins waiting
[1:40:39] they were only the at blood they could
[1:40:42] not go in the presence of god of heaven
[1:40:44] because of goat and sheep blood could
[1:40:47] not take away sin at that time but when
[1:40:50] Jesus resurrected
[1:40:53] The Bible said many of the sins that
[1:40:55] slept in the dust of the earth rose and
[1:40:59] come out of the grave
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; because the originator
[1:41:06] of the quickening power
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; has taken all the Old Testament things
[1:41:10] out.
[1:41:14] Church, the scripture said if the spirit
[1:41:19] that raised Jesus from the death
[1:41:22] dwells in you, it shall quicken your
[1:41:24] mortal bodies.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; That power is in you, church.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Don't look different place. It's in you
[1:41:32] church.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to think about
[1:41:35] different place. It's in you right now.
[1:41:37] As I speak,
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; if the rapture take place right now,
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; many of us shall be translated be
[1:41:42] changed. Because the power is in us.
[1:41:47] They put in power.
[1:41:49] It's in our body. Church.
[1:41:53] The Bible say the spirit
[1:41:56] that was in Christ be in you. It shall
[1:41:59] quicken your morties.
[1:42:03] We are sons and daughters of God.
[1:42:06] Amen. Rebran say he say and they appear
[1:42:09] to many. that wasn't of it is appear to
[1:42:13] many.
[1:42:17] And all of the homeland praise the name
[1:42:20] of the Lord. Brother say he said oh God
[1:42:25] as these hands go up and the music is
[1:42:28] sweetly echoing back down the road as
[1:42:30] you have passed from death unto life
[1:42:33] that has said he that hear my word and
[1:42:36] believe on him that sent me everlasting
[1:42:38] life. He has passed from death unto life
[1:42:42] because you became death that we must be
[1:42:45] life through your resurrection.
[1:42:48] You made little Lord the angels come
[1:42:50] down to be a man come out of the great
[1:42:52] deal of famine from beyond that was made
[1:42:54] flesh and have blood and will share that
[1:42:56] blood that he might make a way of escape
[1:42:59] for all of us. They not only did it, he
[1:43:02] said, "But you prove it." Infallibility
[1:43:05] by raising from the dead and raising the
[1:43:08] dead when you were here on earth. Not
[1:43:10] only that, but you gave, you have made a
[1:43:13] dual proof of his word you did to
[1:43:17] Abraham. Not beside that, you sent back
[1:43:20] the Holy Spirit as a witness.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; He said quicken to a church.
[1:43:28] That's what the church has been
[1:43:30] quickened.
[1:43:32] Church, there's no fear when Christ
[1:43:35] come. You are part of the rapture.
[1:43:36] You're part of the bride.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Forget your mistakes.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Forget your shortcomings.
[1:43:44] You are a rapturing candidate.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Forget about your shortcomings. Forget
[1:43:50] your mistake. I did that one. Satan
[1:43:51] pointing you to that one. Oh, you did
[1:43:53] this one. You did that one. The Bible
[1:43:55] says Satan is the accuser of our
[1:43:56] breeding.
[1:43:58] Satan will always point you to your
[1:44:01] shortcoming, but he'll never point you
[1:44:03] to your successful life.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; He never pointed you to your successful
[1:44:08] life.
[1:44:10] Say what? This man did this, they did
[1:44:12] that, this person did this, they did
[1:44:13] that. But say you're not pointing to the
[1:44:16] ship that sails successfully.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; We are child and we are children of God.
[1:44:24] Shall we listen to our feet?
[1:44:37] Great.
[1:44:46] Listen to work. Listen.
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:28] the Holy
[1:45:30] Ghost
[1:45:33] and God's full
[1:45:38] desire.
[1:45:40] Make me like
[1:45:43] Make me like
[1:45:48] the
[1:45:50] the Christ of hope,
[1:45:54] healing and raising
[1:45:57] the dead.
[1:46:04] in the power
[1:46:07] that Jesus
[1:46:10] has
[1:46:13] and is for
[1:46:17] desire.
[1:46:19] Burn burn Holy Spirit. Oh burn, burn
[1:46:25] Holy Spirit
[1:46:27] burn in me.
[1:46:32] Set my soul
[1:46:36] on fire.
[1:46:39] Fill me with the Holy Ghost. Fill me
[1:46:44] with
[1:46:46] the Holy
[1:46:48] Ghost.
[1:46:51] And God for
[1:46:55] the make me like the Christ of
[1:47:00] Yes. Make me light
[1:47:05] the Christ of all.
[1:47:10] Healing
[1:47:12] and raising
[1:47:14] the dead.
[1:47:17] Give me the power.
[1:47:36] You just think about it tonight, saints,
[1:47:38] as we uh you know sing uh that song and
[1:47:43] after listening to the word being
[1:47:45] preached to us tonight.
[1:47:47] It's a reality.
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:51] Jesus John promise
[1:47:55] that the one that he foruns when he come
[1:47:57] he will baptize us with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:59] and fire.
[1:48:02] And I think that's what we need. We need
[1:48:05] that fire baptism.
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:08] The Holy Ghost is not a concept. It's a
[1:48:11] reality.
[1:48:13] It's not a concept. It's not just a
[1:48:16] feeling good thing. It's a life.
[1:48:20] is something that possess your body.
[1:48:26] We have been quickened.
[1:48:30] The quickening power has come through
[1:48:32] the preaching of the word, through the
[1:48:34] baptisming of the Holy Ghost. It have
[1:48:36] quickened our mortal bodies. That is the
[1:48:39] quickening power that can pick you up
[1:48:40] when you are tired and bring you to
[1:48:42] church.
[1:48:44] That's what gave you the strength to be
[1:48:47] able to to stand for the word.
[1:48:52] That gave you the desire when nobody is
[1:48:54] around to be able to that's the
[1:48:56] quickening power. It's already in your
[1:48:59] mortal body. You are possessors of it.
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:08] And you see it it's it's just like a new
[1:49:11] wine.
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:18] When you get a hold of it, you desire
[1:49:20] more of it.
[1:49:24] If there is something that the church
[1:49:26] needs
[1:49:28] is that fire baptism,
[1:49:31] that fire baptism
[1:49:35] that would just drop down in our heart,
[1:49:38] burn out the things of the world and
[1:49:40] burn out all the things that we are
[1:49:42] fleeting with and all the things that is
[1:49:45] uh that is just uh uh uh useless in our
[1:49:48] time.
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:56] that this thing can become real to us.
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:02] Oh, let's just sing that one more time
[1:50:04] before we pray tonight.
[1:50:06] Burn, burn. Holy Spirit,
[1:50:11] burn in me.
[1:50:15] Set my soul
[1:50:20] on fire.

[1:50:32] Ghost.
[1:50:39] Make me like the Christ of
[1:50:42] Lord. Make me like the Christ
[1:50:49] of all.
[1:50:52] healing
[1:50:54] and raising the dead
[1:51:01] and give him the power
[1:51:05] that Jesus
[1:51:08] had
[1:51:10] through
[1:51:12] the blood.
[1:51:16] Hallelujah tonight. Oh Jesus.
[1:51:20] Oh Jesus,
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:28] we've been told by the messenger that
[1:51:30] that power is lying dominating the
[1:51:32] believer.
[1:51:34] And if there is ever a time that we need
[1:51:36] it to come to life, we don't need a
[1:51:39] power lying dominating us. We need a
[1:51:41] power waking us up and becoming a
[1:51:43] reality to us. Oh God, father, Lord.
