Lord for them the Lord is good and his Merc Mercy endure forever praise the Lord the Lord bless you this morning without taking much of the time thank you musicians we will go right to the word thank you for the cross Lord uh uh I was not thinking about that song but there's a phrase in that song and uh uh that I never thought about until I started singing it the second time and the reason is because uh I I just believe that it was maybe by the uh uh inspiration of the Holy Ghost that brother Lawrence uh uh you know sang that song this morning this this has been couple of years I can't remember now this would be uh a few years now uh maybe four or five years I was I was uh dealing with a situation I was working with some folks and uh uh and I was I was studying one day but what in my studed I was thinking on a certain situation and the thought came to me about the thought of dealing with shame so I wrote that down on my Note and one of my note part and and the lord gave me uh uh some inspiration on the thought I wrote it down and I prayed over it and I said Lord if uh you know at at the time you would want me to talk about this uh it would be good for me to talk about it I it's a good thought and you know my my mind was was just going on and where my thought was actually was uh uh uh how do we deal with shame how do we deal with shame and uh uh how how do we deal with shame how do we uh uh and shame is something that we all deal with we all go through so uh um speaking on uh uh teachers how to pray on Wednesday night and uh I was praying and and just thinking about some other things and then the thought came back to my mind but really what it is is that when I think about it this morning I I'm I'm trusting the Lord to be able to bring this not like a preaching but bring this like a like a prayer meeting this morning where each and every one of us can be able to uh uh identify ourself with the word and uh uh because this is concerning every one of us amen you know the beautiful thing about the house of the Lord is that uh uh this is a place where uh oh I thought I seent it okay okay they said don't have my notes it makes it easy if I preach with our notes then it's a short service praise the Lord amen sorry I don't I don't even have much yet I just have few few uh of course I will be I'll be reading a whole lot uh from different things that uh I was studying through the week and just to just share that with you this is the kind of a subject word I would like to do on a retreat or like to do on a convention you know like there kind of a convention in uh South Africa where they allow you to preach in the morning in the evening in the morning in the evening in the morning in the evening until you tell them you can't preach anymore praise the Lord because I don't believe that we can just use one service to be able to deal with this but where my thought is on this subject is that if there is one hindrance that the church has it is the hindrance of how we deal with shame if there is one thing that is limiting us in our potential is because of Shame praise the Lord and uh uh and just like I said I I hope that I can be able to be able to bring it in a way this morning that it can be uh you know a blessing a blessing to to you and to myself because I need it praise the Lord amen so uh now to take much of the time as a lot of the time has gone we will stand to our feet and turn to the word of God we will read from the book of second Samuel we'll read second Samuel you know this this subject will almost be like one time ago I preach on the message on uh on abuse somehow go Hy hen and I started it year thinking that I was really going to do do do a series on it and I've never come back to it I appreciate two other places one in DC and one in uh North Carolina hasy that uh uh uh brother lar is there and then uh since that time I've not been able to come back to it but uh uh I know few few Saints have reached out to me from from different places that were able to stream it online and uh said it was a blessing so 2 Samuel chapter 10 2 Samuel chapter 10 let's read from verse 1 to5 2 Samuel chapter 10 we'll read from verse 1 to 5 and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of armor died and H his son rain in his stad then said David I will show kindness unto hand of the son of nshi as his father showed kindness unto me and David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and David servant came into the land of the children of an and uh of amor and the princes of the church children of amama said unto uh Hano the Lord their lord think thou that David does honor thy father that he has sent comforters unto thee have not David rather send his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it and to overthrow it wherefor Hannah took David's servants and shave of one half of their beard praise the Lord you know how the Jewish beard is it's a fullface beard that comes down and they shave only one half and leave the other one here praise the Lord I just want to give you give you some picture in your mind that you can be able to deal with this morning he took David's servants and shaved off the one half of their beard and cut off their garment in the middle even to their buts and send them away when they tore it unto David he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the King said T at Jericho until your beard be grown and then return praise the Lord let's pray one more time father Lord you know how nervous I am this morning and every time lord father because Lord and of human ability Lord I don't have Lord to be able to bring your word this morning I'm trusting on the inspiration of the Almighty I say father will you come breathe upon us this morning let something be said Lord that will edify your children something oh God that will be able to draw us closer to you father I pray oh God beyond all of my notes Lord scripture quotes and things we wrote down things we search out to Father Lord will do us no good until you come and take it this morning and father use it to be able to address things in our life we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen praise the Lord what a scripture what an experience now now uh uh let's let's go over to Second uh let's go over to second Samuel let me let me be very sure here um or else I might have written down the wrong U scripture yeah praise the Lord now uh second Samuel chapter 17 now in 2 Samuel chapter 17 you look in verse 26 you realize that this was a time where David was getting away from his son Absalon when Absalon has ruled uh taken his father off the throne and David year getting away from Absalon he will meet one of the son of nemi which is uh uh shba if that's the right pronunciation of the name and uh uh and then they will they would take David in uh in verse 20 27 and 28 and the brought bed and Basin and eting vessel and wheat and ballet and flour parh corn and banss and letters and and and and and honey butter sheep and cheese and and all of those things so they took care of David so you I'm I'm I'm saying this because uh I I was I was going back in the scripture to see uh uh why David wanted to show kindness uh after n she has died and I realized on on another event again uh uh uh when David was running away from Saul uh the Bible say he took his mother and his father over to the land of of of of the Moab the moabites and he told the king to keep his mother let his mother and his father stay there in safety he he don't want them running in the rocks and doing all of this high and seek that he was doing from Saul so uh it gave us a picture to realize that uh uh David he had help he had kindness kindness was shown David during the time of of his AI during the time he was running you know from one country to another running away from s all there were some of these kings that were that were nice to David some of them were very nice and I believe it is one of the reason why David here is uh is is is uh trying to go and show condolence you know after this King has died but now the man uh uh uh his men uh uh uh misunderstood David kindness his his guesture and then they T that uh he had sent his men on recuring so in their mind David has sent his men to spar out the land so they will attack them and uh and and this is the way that they handled David seven shave up their beard toore their clothes expose their nakedness and then send them out of the you know what what what a disgrace you know now it is one think I mean going away from those people they might never come back there you know but how are they going to deal with their presenting themselves to their wives and their children so David taugh there okay I'm going to keep you here in Jericho stay in Jericho until you know uh your beer can grow you know I'm sure David brought new clothes for them and their clothes were Chang and all of that praise the Lord now so uh uh uh uh as we look as we look into this this morning I'm just I'm just only trying to go through the scripture reading here as I'm uh you know um um kind of uh struggling through my nervousness to be able to bring this to you but I believe that uh uh I mean uh with the help of the Lord uh he will help us to be able to say something that will be edifying encouraging to you this morning praise the Lord now so when you look at this subject uh of uh of of dealing with shame shame in itself is a is a very big subject but the the blessing is that uh yesterday uh studying and and looking into the word because when you when you think about shame it's it's so easy for us to think or look at the negative part of Shame Shame has always come from a negative because the truth about the matter that is that uh uh is the devil that introduce us to shame praise the Lord amen we will go through that uh the first time shame was mentioned is in Genesis chapter 2 we'll go through we deal with that the Bible says they were naked and they were not ashamed praise the Lord but then when men fell then they got the sense of Shame so because shame was introduced to us from uh from the fall okay from a negative angle it's hard for us to be able to see the benefit of Shame it's hard for us to be able to see healthy shame but there is healthy shame and and it was actually a blessing for me to for me to be able to see there because for the long time looking at uh at at uh a shame and and you know thinking about the subject of dealing with shame I've always been looking at the negative aspect of Faith the negative side of Fai but it's also good and beautiful for us to realize that there is a positive side of Shame and uh uh and and and and and and some of the positives side of shame let me be go ahead of myself a little bit you realize in Numbers Chapter 6 Numbers Chapter 6 introduce us to what was called The nazare Vow the Nazareth vow was a vow of Separation it was a vow where uh uh men and women in Israel they could they could they could take that vbe for 6 months or a year or they could take it for more and what they would do is that they will they will they will separate themselves you know they will allow their hair to grow you know uh uh and then uh they will Asain from uh uh uh uh wine and they will estain from different things and uh it was it was it was a vow of Separation but when uh when the men were involved in that you see the H Samson was born under a Nazareth vow that's the reason why he was told not to cut the lots of his head now but it is because also onto the the Jewish culture it was an identity of Shame Paul would deal with that in the book of Corinthian where he says when a man keeps long head it is shame unto him why because it was an identity of Shame when a man goes uh okay let me take another example I'm I'm just trying to to I'm trying to capture you praise the Lord let me take another example when when uh when the prophets will will take saot and aches that's another good example saot and arches was also uh uh a position of Shame they are identifying thems uh they are humbling thems praise the Lord amen and and to be able to Humble thems that way they are going to where uh you know uh uh sa it was it was just a tone of clothes a ragged clothes and and then you know and and they just put you know arches all over them you know every everybody and and that is one of the place where we where where we get shame when we are not best presenting ourselves praise the Lord amen when when you are dressed uh uh and you are not best presenting yourself you know you you're always looking around your shoulders and says oh I you know you know you you want to you want to be dressed for the moment for the occasion you know so when uh when the prophets or in the Old Testament when the man or the woman would put on sackcloth and arches it was a way that uh they have made themselves shameful they have made themselves shameful for the situation that was happening maybe they are mouring for the evil that is done in the setting maybe there was a pestilence or there was wall and they are putting themselves before God it's it's in a sense what a person is saying oh God uh uh uh if if if if if I'm the reason why this thing has has happened this thing has happened because of our sin we are putting ourself before you we are saying oh God oh be merciful you know so that is the way when we think about healthy shame it's a way that is designed for us to relook at ourself praise the Lord amen for us to re look at ourself like Paul would say if we J ourself we will not be J are we together praise the Lord amen I'm I'm all over the place this morning but it's beautiful it's very beautiful let's take another scripture here Hebrews chapter 4 a very familiar scripture a very familiar scripture we would like to take Hebrews chapter 4 praise the Lord Hebrew chapter 4:12 very familiar to us for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two edges swore piercing even to the dividing aunder of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and the marrow and the word is a decender of the thoughts and the intents of the heart are we together amen and see the next word the next verse that is behind on a that neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do praise the Lord now the reason why I'm I I read this verse to you is is so is to you know take another Sidetrack year uh uh um to help us to see that just like Paul says the word of God is sharper than the two edges SW and he says it takes the the word to be able to separate and identify our soul our spirit and our body praise the Lord the preaching of the word is for the saving of the Soul praise the Lord amen the preaching of the word is for the saving of of our soul but now when you look at it in the context of the word the Bible tell us that the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the word praise the Lord he placed our names on the lamb Book of Life from the foundation of the word it means there had God in his mind he he T about you like he told Jeremiah I ordained you even before you were in your mother's wom I I had you in my mind are we together praise the Lord so you see the word of God is the only thing I mean when you really look at this uh uh uh verse in the Bible you know it it it throw every psychology through the window praise the Lord it throw every psychology it draw every mind reading and and and all of that is send it through the window it is only the word now so that word comes the preaching of the word the the the reading The Fellowship of the word it really comes to be able to uh uh uh to bring our truth identification praise the Lord amen so just like I said the word is for the saving of the soul is for the cleansing of our spirit yeah and the healing of our body that's right praise the Lord amen it's for the saving of our soul if you are saved this morning and you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ and and and and and he have given you a witness you are saved you saved by the grace of God Is by God's grace that you are saved praise the Lord I'm not preaching to you for you to be safe you are already safe praise the Lord now you see there is another part of the word which goes to deal with the spirit that's what Paul says the word is is sharper it goes between the sword and spirit it brings a uni identification to these two things the spirit our spirit man just like I said on Wednesday is one of is one of the most difficult thing of our being praise the Lord so the word comes the word is preached for the cleansing of our spirit and that's why Paul would say in Ephesians chapter 5 we are watched by the watching of the Water by the word of God Amen that watching is is it's our spirit that needs to be watched you remember when we read that verse over there in Jeremiah the heart of man is desperately wicked the deeper sense is that is uncurable it's uncurable the heart is uncurable now that that's now where your blood vessel comes out of is that little chamber in your heart praise the Lord amen the medical doctor can be able to do the best that he can thank God for all the bypass heart surate and and and heart surer and all of that that they have done but this heart that is desperately wicked that Jeremiah spoke about is uncurable that's the reason why in The Book of Jeremiah he says I will we give you a new heart praise the Lord amen I will give you a new heart and it's it's almost just like uh in in the book of uh Leviticus in the Old Testament you will realize uh uh uh uh the condition of uh of of leprosy was always cleansed you hear it in the scripture you never really year where the lepr was healed the lepo was cleansed why because it was an infection that could go away and come again and that is the way with our spirit our spirit man needs constant watching it needs constant watching Praise the Lord with the soul when God save you you are safe praise the Lord amen amen the battle there in your spirit is how for you to enjoy the joy of your salvation that is the constant battle that we go through our spirit man praise the Lord so the word comes to be able to cleanse our spirit and that very same word word heals our body Paul says to the joints and the marrow that this with our blood a descender of our thoughts and the intents of our heart glory be to God are we together so you see that's that is the reason why we want to use the word this morning morning and and trust that uh the Lord will be able to help us as we as we look at the subject of dealing with shame praise the Lord just like I said you go to uh uh Genesis chapter 2 the Bible says glory be to God Genesis chapter 2 verse 25 are we together now so when you when you when you read that and the chapter in the way that the the stripes arrange it the chapter ends that way verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and mother cleave unto his wife and they shall be one and they were both naked and the man in his wife and they were not ashamed now there are many other ways like uh uh someone said that that's that the end of that chapter could be written the man and the wife they were naked and they were happy praise the Lord it could be written that way or they were naked they were very strong and confident they were naked and without fear fear Without Anger without sadness without disappointment without regret it could be written that way and if it was written that way it would still be the truth because that's what it was they never had no fear amen they were not disappointed they were very strong they were very uh confident they were happy but there's a reason why there's a reason why I believe the Holy Spirit describe it or the choose of words the choice of words the emphasis that God wanted to make why the emphasis was on shame I believe it is not an accident there is something really powerful really really powerful because think about it just think about it in in that context that they were they were they were not afraid they were happy because you see our truth makeup we are are made not to be ashamed praise the Lord because shame in a trueu sense only became our attribute from the fall praise the Lord so I believe that is the reason why the emphasis is there is to be able to grab our mind something something has robbed us something has affected Us Praise the Lord and as I was as I was looking into this and steading reading different thing you know uh Medical Science says uh even even the little babies even the little baby like that little child I tried to hold and uh you know and she pulled back and started crying it's not only because uh uh she's a fresh she never see me sometimes that's the way that little children are ashamed it comes with a sense of fear I've never seen this person before praise the Lord but in our original makeup the way the Lord made us we were not to be ashamed praise the Lord Hallelujah we were not to be ashamed he says in the book of Isaiah my people shall not be ashamed praise the Lord he wanted for us to be open he wanted for us to be free to lift our hands to say thank you to be able to worship to be able to praise to be able to express ourself but something happened to the hon spirit and that thing is robbing us from the Liberty from the spirit of Liberty that God want us to live in Praise the Lord amen from the spirit of Liberty that he want us to walk in the way he want us to serve him is robbing us of our trueu potential our trueu being because of shame it is it's almost like we we we always want to make it up to others it is not sometimes you know with the present culture and all of the things that is going on sometimes it is not how much more of how I want to dress but what would people think about me what would people say about me you know what would people you know what what is going through their mind when I walk through that door are we together praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we ser and how we need the Lord to help us amen how we need the Lord to help us every one of us every one of us in this room this morning has been exposed to one form of shame or another praise the Lord and sometimes that sense of Shame comes you know as I was thinking about this it was it was helping me to be able to look at myself really look at myself look into my life you know you will realize that the some deep sense of Shame comes from places of abuse that uh people goes through the truth of the matter today is that we all in one form or shape has been abused praise the Lord amen in one form of shap we have experienced some sense of abuse and when you take it back to the fall you will realize that with the Liberty the Adam and Eve the first Son of God and the first daughter of God the Liberty the the that they had before the father you know look at that word uh of you know being naked that not ashamed don't just look at it as our physical body look at it in the sense of Freedom look at it in the sense of Liberty amen they could express themsel and they they never had had to think whether is it the word of God they I say the word is it the right word is it the word of God or is is it not the word of God they never had to go through all of that praise the Lord whatever name that Adam was call any of the animal he was certainly that God will be pleased with it he was certain that he was doing his best and God will be pleased with his best praise the lord it's because of shame that we triy to measure up whatever name he called whatever animal plant it was just the Bible says God came down in the CT of the evening and and and the law was placed praise the Lord and every day as they come to the end of the day it was a fulfilled day praise the Lord they were fulfilled they knew that they have done what was required of them if it was not done that day it was not supposed to be done that day praise the Lord and whatever we do to the end of our day must be a fulfilled day but what why is the reason why many times we don't feel fulfilled even sometimes we are tired but it looks like we have not done enough yet oh I if if I if I was just going to do this I just needed to spend some few hours and finish this and and and and and and and and all because of that also we we kind of for drag ourself even though we are tired we drag ourself to the extreme because uh we feel that it is not enough praise the Lord a little sense of shame that if we don't complete it if we don't go and exerise we have not done our best yet but to Adam every day was a fulfilled Day praise the Lord amen every day was a fulfilled day now so we see right there in the word with the Liberty that they had I mean uh they were not judging themselves whether you know they were right before God or whether they were wrong before God whether the song was right whether the preaching was right whether you know God's uh uh they spend much time in the presence of God you know they never had those things were not running through their mind it was time of for Fellowship they show up for Fellowship they praise the Lord that you know God commanded them for what they did you know they tell the Lord what they did that day it was the end of the day they go home they are happy they are just happy they are enjoying the plants they are enjoying the animal they are enjoying one another there was no boundary there was nothing of Eve that Adam didn't know nothing of Adam that Eve never know praise the Lord amen glory be to God I was just uh listening to uh a good friend a brother I just went to be with the Lord and brother George Martins I was listening to one of his messages trying to remember him you know he was he was he was such a man with with a different character you know then he was saying uh talking about uh Adam and Eve you know he says uh you know uh the God had to put the man to sleep before the woman was made so before he he got out of sleep the woman eyes were opening seeing him coming out of sleep you know so he says well there I mean there are things that uh uh you know Adam will will have not known of Eve how she was made but they they have things that Eve knew of Adam because she saw him coming out of sleep praise the Lord her eyes were open before his eyes now so looking at this as we as we want to look at it this morning I'm I'm really kind of a shifting here just like I said looking at this subject my mind was just on completely on the other side of uh of what shame is it's is it's negative content but you realize there the Genesis chapter 3 when Adam and Eve will break the word of God when the when when the when the serpent the Bible says he will begal Eve when the serpent will deceive them when the serpent will rob them praise the Lord amen when the serpent will rob them you have to realize that uh even when when when God created the angels to worship Him the Angels had limit praise the Lord amen the Angels had limit they were only creatures to worship all they they could do was you know holy holy is the Lord you know the kind of a expression that Adam had before God the way he will walk with God the way he would talk with God the way he will be able to carry out the very desire of God that was not given to the angels praise the Lord amen it was not given to the angels and and and and that gave me the thought to always think there the day that God Express and says let us made man in our image and in our likeness I believe that day that H uh Lucifer that was where his rage came from from because to be able to get somebody in your likeness is almost like your twin amen God is going to make a creature like him which mean he's going to be better than us the Angels God is going to make a creature that will be his very expression praise the Lord hallelujah amen so if there is anything that he will do to be able to rob you and myself from that that is the greatest battle that this started and is going on right now praise the Lord think about this Paul says this in Ephesian he says that Christ Tau it not robbery to be equal with God even though he was placed in a suffering body even though he was placed in the body of sisting elements and he knew what was going to Beall him to the Cross but he never thought one bit that any of those things Rob him of being equal with God praise the Lord you see because he never came back the natural birth that you and myself came from that's what Rob Us Praise the Lord it Rob us and put us in a place where we judge ourself we are judged by others praise the lord we do shameful things and we are ashamed by things that are done around us praise the Lord hallelujah that's what gave us this sense of always trying to hide or cover ourself praise the Lord the Bible says uh when Adam fell they took a fake Lea and the thems that expression that Liberty that they had in the presence of God they were Robb of it they could no longer go without checking thems they could no longer go without looking in the mirror and they go out and they come back and look in the miror again are we together praise the Lord but see how God how did God de with their sense of shame how did the almighty God de with the sense of shame that they had praise the Lord amen Adam in shame was hiding himself he never only took a faith Le and covered his nakedness but the Bible says he hid himself and God knowing that they are not exposed to something they they they they are exposed to something that they never knew before and what they were exposed to is shame glory be to God think about God way of dealing with shame the first thing he went after them amen it was now Adam that was calling to God and say Lord I need you the serpent has deceived me praise the Lord no it was not Adam calling to God it was God calling him saying Adam Adam where are you praise the Lord he says I I've heard your voice and I've hid myself and the next question that God will ask him who told you who told you who told you that you were naked who told you who about shame who shame you praise the Lord amen who shame you so so you see it God approached to shame the preaching of the word is not to shame you praise the Lord when the preacher comes in his mind and says I'm I'm I'm I'm going to blast those people he's completely out of the word of God no matter how much things are said and we say amen and things are said and we rejoice and many of the times the people get in their attitude because things that have been said and they are shouting somebody they are thinking about they're not thinking about themselves in their mind somebody has been shamed praise the Lord God question was who shame you this was not the way you were behaving who has shamed you glory be to God God approach was to be able to identify the one that has brought the shame and not only identifying the one that has brought the shame he came with a better covering he's identifying the shame and he's also covering their shame he's giving them something better that they can be able to come back into his presence better that they can be able to come back and still have the same sense of Joy the same sense of Freedom he came with a lime skin he came with a bleeding skin praise the Lord he first identified who cause the shame and that is our first step to Liberty if we can be able to identify what is making me ashamed what what is it praise the Lord and who am I ashamed of are we together oh Lord I need your help this morning praise the Lord I need your help this morning because just like the devil did in the beginning he's doing the same if he can just shame Us Praise the Lord and you will even realize that some of the things that shame us are some of the things that no nobody know but you and yourself but yet we are ashamed so you see it's a spirit think praise the lord it's a spirit think think about if if I if I made a mistake praise the Lord amen if I made a mistake you see i h h h h and and and and and then uh uh you you tell me of the mistake and he says oh you know what you're not supposed to do this and and and uh well I well I'm sorry I'm sorry now when that has been de with because I have done wrong even if I was hiding that wrong and you come and and and you know and and and and tell me about the wrong now I know you know about it and I know about it and we talk it over you you realize you just realize from the from from the the uh uh from a human sense you realize that you don't you don't feel ashamed again because somebody knows about it and you have already talked about it praise the Lord amen you have already talked about it you see that's the reason why brother brandham says the devil hates to be exposed amen he hat to be exposed you know because that's that's where he gets uh he gets the advantage if he can just keep people in isolation if he he can just keep people under the bonage of thoughts that condemns them glory be to God hallelujah if he can just keep us under the thought that condemn us James says in the Book of James if our heart condemn us not he says if our heart condemn us not we have confidence before God it means that if we don't feel a sense of Shame and what takes that sense of Shame if we come openly and confess it to the father think about this now think about this God is a spirit they that worship he must worship Him in spirit and in truth glory be to God Amen we do wrong and and and you know we misbehave and and you know what and and we we tell lies that's that's our makeup is and know in in in in saying that my mother conceived me and uh uh and and and we come to the father and we say we said Lord please forgive me and and you know and Lord I'm sorry that I did this and you know and we confess praise the Lord but you will realize that the devil will use that very thing that we have said to God he can come back to our mind and makes it so real praise the Lord and he can keep you under such a conviction that you will go to hell for this thing that you have done now he's not he's not physical he's a spirit praise the Lord and when we are praying to God he's not physical God is a spirit praise the Lord but see what is happening here is that his voice his condemnation becomes so real to us then us feeling the sense of God's forgiveness take on the scale if you as a Son of God or a daughter of God can go in the presence of God and say Lord help me father I'm wrong please forgive me Lord and I mean you can really pull yourself out and you speak to God and you know that you have spoken to God praise the Lord amen and Satan comes with his lies and say well you know I mean you you are just wasting your time you know uh this thing that you have done is so is so evil the what I'm trying to bring to us this morning is that you see we stop by the church requirement we sto by the denominational requirement what the church have said we should do and what the scripture I mean our our understanding of the scripture we really don't go to the father that's the reason why many times when we come right out of there the enemy can come back and use that same feeling in our hearts praise the Lord and make us to feel guilty and he starts to shame us again praise the lord it's because we just stop as far as our Creed told us to stop Lord please forgive me and sometimes we are not Earnest about it sometimes our heart is not out there praise the Lord glory be to God I have news for the devil this morning amen I have news for the devil this morning you know when brother brandham said when the weakest Christian go on their knees to pray amen when the weakest Christian go on their knees to pray and really get in touch with God he says all hell shakes praise the Lord hallelujah and that is to says that when we can really get in fellowship with our father and start and stop listening to all the lies of the devil no matter how loud his lies are you have to tell him what the father have said praise Lord this word of God needs to come more loud in our ears this word needs to be so loud in our heart that no matter what the devil will says to our ears it will never overcome what the promise have said in this book praise the Lord to many of us Jesus voice is I love you I love you you have have to make that loud you got to tune the volume on praise the Lord You Have To Tune the volume on and let it sound I love you praise the Lord if there is one thing that the devil have is a big mouth and he know how to make himself loud praise the Lord he knows how to make himself loud and he can make himself so loud that nothing you can hear but just condemnation nothing you can hear you can never even see anything good of yourself the Bible say he's the accuser of the Brethren praise the Lord and you know what an accuser does accuser shame praise the Lord accuser comes to shame are we together who told you you were shame who told you that you have to be shamed praise the Lord Adam got so confused God asking him who told you he got so ashamed I mean so confused said the woman you gave me praise the Lord the woman said decep and begil me but what was God trying to to do he was trying to identify the cause of Shame where did it came from praise the Lord where did it came from glory be to God hallelujah amen and shame can cause feeling inside sense of guilt glory be to God can cause a sense of guilt and you see and that's what the preaching of the word by telling us the promises in the book by telling us what God has done for us the provision that he has made is to release us from that guilt praise the Lord now because God knows in the way our human spirit is built we will not forget we will not forget the things that happen to us we will not forget the way people treat us we will not forget the things that people said about us praise the Lord amen and you see because the devil knows that we don't forget that's the reason why he keep reminding us but you see what the word is promised to do is to release you from guilt praise the Lord is to take that feeling of guilt take take for example let me give you an example someone can come and talk about you know when you were a little child we went down to the park and you were taking the m and you were just eating the M I said little baby you have grown so far from that praise the Lord amen you think about it now think think about it you have grown so far from that that in the first instance you don't remember amen you don't remember I mean even if they had a picture they are showing you you know what you were doing here you were eating M you don't remember why because you have grown now your growth has has released you praise the Lord amen then if you were still a little child and and and and not don't don't eat that and a little child you come and you remind you see you were eating M down that little that little soul you know is terrified that you keep bringing that thing back to their mind praise the Lord but because you have grown to such an age all you can do is to just smile praise the Lord you don't feel bad about it that you were eating much praise praise the Lord you see that's what the word does to the believer it takes guilt away the word brings you above your fault it raise you to a level praise the Lord that no matter how much the devil remind you you are so above your fault you can just look back and [Music] laugh praise the Lord but you think about living on the privilege and not appreciating what Grace have done for us praise the Lord not appreciating what Grace have done for us and we keep remembering that we ate much oh my God I can't believe it I can't believe I ate much praise the Lord if that M who have killed you from 2 years old you will not be 30 now praise the Lord if the M that you ate who have killed you will not be 18 aren't you grateful that you are 18 aren't you grateful that you are at the age that you are and you did not die why should you Moon after the MTH from two years off praise the Lord oh my God oh my God hallelujah is somebody with me this morning oh praise the Lord oh praise the Lord what an awesome God that we have what a wonderful God that we have glory be to God he don't want us to live in shame you are a son of the king you are the daughter of the king he don't want you to live in shame but he want you to be mindful of your less praise the Lord he don't want you to live in shame but he want you to be mindful of where he took you from it's two different things it's two different things praise the Lord Hal hallelujah it's two different things he don't want you to live in a life of Shame praise the Lord because if shame is driving you you can do nothing but shame others you can only affect people with the things that are affecting you praise the Lord Hallelujah when you find people that are too judgmental it's because they are just judging thems they're just judging thems it's it's a it's it's an unsettle Spirit praise the Lord are we together we love the Lord this morning we can say thank you for the cross Lord we can say thank you for the price that you paid bearing all my sin and shame oh my oh my thank you Lord amen I will tell you you make me to feel so good I was so nervous thinking of this Lord you got to help me you got to help me because with the human nature it's so easy to drive down that line of just being negative praise the Lord amen but we want to thank god he's a good god let's just read something this morning there to that will help us a little bit here you know brother Baron preached the message influence and in the mage message influence what he taught us for us to realize is that our life on Earth is been influenced from one of the two Dimensions or one of the two regions our life on Earth is either influenced from the region of the lust or the region of the Blessed praise the Lord whatever we are doing we are we we we we we we are been driven by an influence amen so he took the he took Isaiah chapter 6 and he make us to see here is Isaiah the prophet having a friend Yia the king but because of his goly life life that he had a prophet the order of God is there is the prophet the priest and the king the king is not above the prophet praise the Lord no the prophet the king go to the prophet to consult the prophet that's why David went to the prophet but here is a prophet a man that's supposed to be uh uh uh the Watchman the man that's supposed to be getting a word from the Lord and bringing it over to yuzer he's uh he's so he's so influenced by yuzer he had he has left his office as a prophet he's sticking with his friend Yu and and I mean they into all the political things and they into all the you it's not that he was doing something wrong but when it came to the place that he as a king exalted himself in the house of God to blow incense praise the Lord you think about it was Isaiah afraid to warn him was his was his influence on Isaiah affected Isaiah so much that Isaiah couldn't say you that's not your place oh yeah sometime it do happen sometime it do happen We R influence some people and their influence sometimes makes it hard for us to correct them praise the Lord but he was out of the word of the Lord and God struck him with Leprosy and that thing Open the Eyes of aiah and say he comes right in the house of God putting himself down oh God forgive me Lord oh I'm unclean I'm a man undone and and I mean he's he pour his heart so much before God that God has to lift him lift his Spirit up back into the place where he's supposed to be praise the Lord read the book of Isaiah after Isaiah chapter 6 his preaching changed before Isaiah chapter 6 Isaiah only talks about H Jerusalem and and and and and and and and and what was happening at that time but after Isaiah chapter 6 chapter 7 he breaks into a virgin shall conceive he started looking in the future why because God Has Lifted him up praise the Lord God Has Lifted him up from the shame of the death of yir and brother br will talk about now how God will make him to see in the Heavenly Reign the sarapin with two Wings they cover their eyes two wings they cover their feet in two ways they fly in the presence of the Lord praise the Lord now you see God is taking asire from what will have become a destructive shame what could have transformed into a toxic shame pra praise the Lord oh my that's the thing that is killing Our Generation toxic shame praise the Lord is destroying the minds of our young people because of all the shameful things that they have been exposed to in a young age the gossip the killing the violence praise the lord it's so toxic until the generation the young the young people as soon as they he a sense of violence something in them drive them there they want to run they want to run what could have become a destructive shame to aai when he came in the presence of God God lifted him above it and God opened his eyes to a heavenly vision praise the Lord and now God is going to give him another form of Shame praise the Lord because after he realized that being a Prophet this is where I'm supposed to be I got myself so much in the politics and all the things that was happening now God is going to deal with him so much that he's going to come to the house of God In humbleness Praise the Lord amen he says the twins that cover their face what it represent reverence God will show him you want more of me you got to get the spirit of reverence you want to see more Vision aai you want me to reveal to you about the millenum you want me to show you Isaiah 53 how the Messiah will be rejected he will be Bru you want me to show you things you got to get the spirit of reverence praise the Lord praise the Lord amen because God God don't gossip to every gossip there is two three different version glory be to God you want me to show you deeper things he wrote the entire Bible it was aiah that said in the in this 14th chapter how are thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer God took him to the beginning in chapter 60 God took him to the end show him the end of time and show him the millennium are we together brother says here influence he said Remember the word of God the word is God the word is God and if a sarapin that knows no sin how to cover his face to stand in the presence of God how are we going to appear that day when we stand in his presence in the presence of his word preach and toughly Vindicated by the Holy Ghost he said now the people don't have reverence for him why isn't it that people don't reverence God he it reverence was uh only pertain to God he say it spoke of twice in the Bible both times it pertain to god notice the reason they don't do it because they are not fully convinced that it is God praise the Lord they are now fully convinced it's a serious thing for us to have the word that we have in our Edge and be dealing with some of the shameful things that we are dealing with are we convinced that God has come to us in the form of the word or are we just only stopping that we have believed brother brandham to be a prophet and we are in the message because this word that is sharper than two edges SW was the same word that came to Adam and resolve his shame issue praise the Lord that same word can resolve our shame issue whatever is shame in us or whatever shameful thing that we are involving praise the Lord the word can dissolve it it's the word that redeemed Adam it was the word that came forth and said Adam Adam where are you and our word was able to break his word of Shame and bring him back into an open praise the Lord he was in an open he did not mind what what the animal would said about him what the seent was said about him he was back in an open thank God I have my Liberty thank God I can call back to the father but he saying here the reason why is because we are not convinced baptizing in Jesus name is has become just sufficient for us praise the Lord all brother Brandon photo has become sufficient for us the word is a life this word is a person praise the Lord amen it's a person people this is the word that will take us in the Rapture God has not put us in the hands of any mortal men to take us in the Rapture God after he used Men He Turned us over to the word he turned us over to the word that's the reason why he brought us a son of man Ministry a Ministry that Vindicated the word it was not a Vindication of William brandham if God didn't help him he would have ended a drunk just like his father God was vindicating his word and he has turned us over to the word that's the reason why most of the men that claim to be the next followers God is taking them off the same why to get our eyes on the word it must be the word nothing but the word let the word become a person to you this word has to be real to us it can heal the word can heal the word can deliver the word can cleanse the word can set free the word can break habits the word can take us out of our shame and give us a smile again somebody drove the service this morning at me you're looking my notes is completely different from where we going this morning but I think the Lord has been gracious to us praise the Lord I believe that the Lord has been gracious just to [Applause] us

this subject I was looking into an article where I came across uh a [Music] testimony of one of [Music] uh one of the US uh one of the the best uh baseball patri [Music] and this this guy [Music] U one year he in 2012 he got the seaw Young Award and and after that award he opened up and he started to talk about the shame that he had held in his life and it came from uh a sexual abuse that he had when he was [Music] young and he said he carried that as a [Music] weight and one day a soul bother him until he went to the ocean and he was swimming trying to swim until he would lose strength and drown [Music] himself because he couldn't deal with Fai this is what he said he said it has been locked away for 23 years it had wrecked har on my life and the relationship I have had in my life not only with my friends who really wearing my [Music] friends I didn't trust anybody he said my wife didn't know the dark thing about me had kind of coin Hall into marry me almost he say it's tough to it's tough to emit I love her dearly so I projected who I wanted to be but would never let her inside because I've always fear if somebody knew the real me they will run the other way he said that was it was it was a painful it was it was so Rong but yet [Music] yet that was Earnest it was an Earnest look as shame you see and if we if we look in our I will just take the time this morning to bring our heart to the Lord Saints if you realize you will realize that we are caught different we are made different with the atmosphere that the Lord has given us this morning no doubt we can make an alter call this morning but I don't want to bring you to an altar I want you to meet him in your heart I want I want the word to become so real in your mind that you can get a touch of [Music] him because my Hing is just a human Hing I'm not afraid to lay my hands on you I'm not afraid to pray with you but if I can get you to him [Music] [Music] and that is the thing that is that is that is robbing us you find people they would love to testify but they are ashamed they look like people looking at them people will love to sing but they they just you know uh yeah and uh if if you really realize it know that out I believe that God is dealing with each and every one of us in wonderful ways I believe sometimes there are words that the Lord will put on your heart and put on your mind you could write it down and it could be a blessing to someone but sometimes we tell ourself who am I I'm not a preacher and the devil just blast our mind and he just shame us and brother bandam in the message Hasam will say that we feel embarrassed to even tell somebody about [Music] Jesus for I believe that word that is powerful than the two edges SW I believe that word that is a person oh since that's that's what God sent us Elijah the prophet that's why God sent us Malachi 4 is to make the word a person now for every one of us to take a trip to Jeffersonville I don't have any problem with that but I believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I believe that he's a present tense God I believe that he's a real God whatever the the enemy is trying to use to make you
