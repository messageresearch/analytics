========================================

group of people and I can honestly say this I have in my age I'm beginning to think about slowing down and I've often thought if the time ever come that I could really settle down and just sit down in a church and enjoy fellowshipping enjoy the word where would I go who would I choose to set under and I don't believe that I would have to go and look very far but y'all would have to pray for me because your Winters are brutal amen now my wife don't know that amen so you would have to pray for me and not only in the weather case but my wife also brother brother Hernandez says if I can make it here brother you can make it also so church I'm not going to hold you any longer I I think those of you that have been here with me before over the years since uh 2000 I think you know that I love you and appreciate you and every time I get a call will you come to Minneapolis my heart is already on fire I am going to share one more thing with you and this is personal it was on the way into church yesterday and Brother Juan called me and he didn't know how I don't say he didn't know how but he approached the subject that I'm going to talk to you about trying to be as smooth as it could be and he asked about the cost of the airplane tickets it was concerned I'm sure how am I going to reimburse brother Prater for his expense and getting here traveling isn't like it used to be right it's like everything else so I asked brother well why worry about it and then a few more words are spoken I said well you can pay me back by coming to Fort Smith Arkansas in October of this year and he is on the roster to preach so y'all get in mind to let him go but more than that come with him get in that bus that he's been talking about and come to Arkansas where the reason we're having our meeting in October is that it's about 110 degrees there now and that gets a little uncomfortable even for me so I want you all to know that you would treat you so many ways you'll have to like one of them but it's been a pleasure over there it's been a good journey some of you this may be my first time having met you or fellowship with you but I love you and the Lord does too and I spill I I just feel a real close Association with each and every one of you and if I start calling names and selling this person that person how how you have impressed me over the over the years well we would be here the
