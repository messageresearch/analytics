[0:52] thank you
[0:57] [Music]
[1:15] foreign
[1:16] [Music]
[1:45] [Music]
[2:05] thank you
[2:16] him to write that that maybe even to
[2:20] this night that we might call out the
[2:22] context of our texts to show our Paul
[2:26] said this because his scripture and
[2:28] scripture is eternal not be that setting
[2:32] in this dingy old jail that Paul wrote
[2:37] the uh serious cloudy here that his
[2:41] brother that he was a prisoner of Jesus
[2:45] Christ so he could express it by seeing
[2:47] what was around him now he was in jail
[2:51] but that wasn't what he was speaking to
[2:53] this uh this uh
[2:55] uh servant of Christ a minister with him
[2:59] he was speaking and he was a prisoner to
[3:03] the word of Jesus Christ because Christ
[3:06] is the word
[3:08] Paul has been a great scholar and he
[3:11] says yes growing ambition
[3:14] he was uh he was a
[3:17] uh a man that had been trained with uh
[3:21] by a people
[3:23] uh fell off in the name of gamelia which
[3:25] was a great teacher obviously one of the
[3:27] greatest schools that he could have went
[3:29] to Richard like we say wheatner Bob
[3:32] Jones or some great Fundamental School
[3:34] they've been taught
[3:36] as as a minister of the word
[3:40] and he was well educated and smart
[3:43] an intelligent boy with a great
[3:45] ambitionist maybe someday becoming a
[3:48] priest or a high priest to his people he
[3:51] had an ambition
[3:53] and then the father these great
[3:56] Ambitions he had been trained for and
[3:59] spent all his life for maybe the age of
[4:01] about eight or ten years old up to about
[4:04] 30 or 35 when he's finished college and
[4:08] graduated and had all these diplomas and
[4:11] everything and stood in good with all
[4:13] the the clergy even to the high priests
[4:16] at Jerusalem he had had orders from him
[4:19] personal lawyers written and trusted
[4:22] with this great Saul to go down to the
[4:26] Master Center find all those down there
[4:28] that worship God contrary to what he
[4:31] said and to find them and put them in
[4:34] jail the necessary there is to put him
[4:37] to death if he wanted to he was a great
[4:40] ambition and now all that he has trained
[4:44] for
[4:45] God has took it all out of him
[4:50] and what his objective off
[4:54] and what it is his father has spent his
[4:56] money for and the Ambitions of his
[4:59] father and mother was all I had been
[5:02] taken away from him
[5:04] because if God had something else
[5:09] therefore he was a prisoner
[5:12] from his objective that he had in life
[5:15] and he'd become a prisoner to Jesus
[5:18] Christ who was the word amen that road
[5:21] to Damascus
[5:23] cheese ball
[5:26] going down about 11 o'clock for the rest
[5:28] of the day
[5:30] then he was stricken down and he heard a
[5:33] boy saying sorrow or I persecuted Sami
[5:37] and he looked up and looking up being a
[5:40] Jew and no Bachelor of power was the
[5:42] Lord that led the children of Israel
[5:44] because he knew that's what it was
[5:46] remember this Hebrew would have never
[5:49] called anything wrong capital L O R D
[5:53] Elohim unless he'd been satisfied that's
[5:56] what it was because he was trained
[5:59] scholar
[6:00] ever and when he looked up and he's seen
[6:02] this alive a pair of fire that had led
[6:05] his people through the awareness and he
[6:09] said Lord Elohim
[6:16] I want a surprise it must have been to
[6:18] this Theologian before I'm Jesus
[6:23] the very worm that he was sword against
[6:26] why
[6:27] turn around
[6:31] oh
[6:33] it must have been something terrific for
[6:35] this man
[6:37] but all these Ambitions that he had to
[6:41] find out all it was he'd been
[6:43] persecuting
[6:45] uh his Ambitions that drove into a
[6:49] further away from the main thing that he
[6:52] meant to do
[6:53] and what a great shock it must have been
[6:56] to this Apostle wasted on Jesus
[7:09] you see as they make fun of the church
[7:14] they're not really making fun of the
[7:16] church they are making fun of Jesus amen
[7:20] hallelujah
[7:22] persecutive style me
[7:25] how could Paul name with all these
[7:28] interests believe that this was that
[7:30] this group that he was persecuting was
[7:34] the very God that he claimed to be
[7:38] serving amen I think that without going
[7:42] into details I think we're all well
[7:45] trained enough to know what I mean here
[7:46] and the same thing is happening today
[7:51] ignorance
[7:55] well yet intelligent and smart much
[7:58] smaller uneducated galileans that he was
[8:01] persecuting at an already in their
[8:03] humility accepted this man is lost but
[8:07] Paul in his great teaching and his
[8:09] interactions could not accept that and
[8:13] let us turn around it must be to him on
[8:16] this road
[8:17] any restricted blind so he would not
[8:20] carry out his Commission but was laid
[8:23] down to a place in a street called
[8:26] straight and the house of one and then
[8:30] come the prophet down every name of
[8:32] ananias he saw a vision him coming down
[8:35] so old was that went down to where he
[8:38] was and went in and said brother Saul
[8:40] the Lord appeared to you on the road
[8:43] down set neither I might lay my hands up
[8:46] on you and you receive your sight and be
[8:47] filled with the Holy ghosts
[8:49] [Music]
[8:52] what a thing it must have been for Paul
[8:56] see all that he had been trained to do
[8:59] was Christ diversity amen so down with
[9:04] all the education he had it it would
[9:07] just become not to him
[9:09] now he do that he had an experience
[9:13] so here's another good lesson for us
[9:16] that experienced a role is enough
[9:21] it's got to be our experience according
[9:25] to the word of the Lord
[9:35] he took three years and six months down
[9:38] in the the desert in Arabia
[9:42] taking the Bible as it was in the Old
[9:45] Testament and going down there to uh to
[9:49] compare this experience that he had had
[9:53] and see if it was script
[9:56] and that was he says well I guess that
[9:59] was just a little blow over and it went
[10:01] off I must follow the Idris now he had
[10:04] to become a prison to something
[10:06] a prison so as you're comparing it and
[10:10] seeing no wonder he could Rush the book
[10:11] of Hebrews as a types
[10:14] see three years and a half die laying in
[10:17] the word and finding out that the big
[10:20] God that colony was taking him back and
[10:25] changing all of his intellects changing
[10:30] already trained to be all these ambition
[10:32] just washed it away from him and he
[10:36] became a prisoner
[10:39] the love of God
[10:41] has been so tremendous and such a
[10:44] revelation that he could not get away
[10:48] from it amen that's the true experience
[10:51] of ever real believers who meet God
[10:54] hallelujah you come in contact with
[10:57] something that's so great that you that
[11:00] that you become a prisoner to everything
[11:03] else
[11:04] you get away from everything to imprison
[11:07] yourself to this it's expressed one time
[11:10] where Jesus is the Kingdom of Heaven Is
[11:12] Something Like a Man buying pearls now
[11:14] when he finds US grateful he said I know
[11:17] that he's got to get that one and that's
[11:19] what I hear you you have an intellectual
[11:21] conception you have a a a theological
[11:24] experience but when it comes to a time
[11:27] that when you you're really behind the
[11:30] real thing that you you just tell
[11:32] everything else amen and you close
[11:35] yourself into this
[11:37] Paul knew what it was he was he found
[11:41] out that he was honest to something amen
[11:46] a horse and a harness it's the it's the
[11:50] pool something and Paul knew after this
[11:55] experience as three years and a half of
[11:59] piping the The Experience he has with
[12:03] the Bible he realized that God has
[12:06] chosen him
[12:20] and today as Servants of Christ we
[12:24] become honest
[12:27] hooked up
[12:29] we can't
[12:32] Amen
[12:35] to the work
[12:37] no matter what anyone else says your
[12:39] heart is true
[12:40] there's something about it that you just
[12:44] can't get away from amen amen you've
[12:46] been dropped up with it by the Holy
[12:48] Ghost has got you to the world and no
[12:51] matter what anyone else says it's the
[12:53] word that's always
[13:12] those things now that's where we find
[13:15] today that we must be strict person and
[13:19] people don't want to be strict heaven
[13:22] the Methodist feeling was to hold you a
[13:24] little bit of his Methodist teaching
[13:25] yeah the practice teaching
[13:30] but you've got to absolutely be stripped
[13:34] of everything amen and just born again
[13:37] afresh and take us from there let the
[13:39] Holy Spirit leads us
[13:43] when he a guardian went to church he
[13:46] shook hands with the pastor he's a good
[13:48] loyal neighbor that might have been all
[13:49] right for his race but we're in another
[13:50] race
[13:52] now we must come back to the Bible times
[13:55] for this day the priest was harnessed
[13:57] too but you see they'll come over into
[14:00] another dispensation
[14:08] in the same thing we find today we did
[14:10] come through a denominational age
[14:13] as we prove through the church teaches
[14:15] the Bible and so forth but we come now
[14:17] just free age where the Holy Spirit
[14:21] himself comes down and vindicates
[14:23] himself and makes himself known makes
[14:26] Amos promise that he promised come to
[14:29] pass
[14:33] and he knew
[14:35] that's another thing he knew he could
[14:39] not go to places
[14:42] this being harnessed to this that he
[14:45] will not if he didn't he wanted to go
[14:48] and he knew that it is ambition draw him
[14:52] amongst bread amen was invited to come
[14:55] and yet he was fresh in the spirit of
[14:58] everybody else
[15:00] he wasn't his own
[15:03] maybe somebody could say or a Brother's
[15:06] child with a plow we want you to come
[15:08] over here because we've got the biggest
[15:10] church we got the biggest congregation
[15:11] your offerings will be grossed and so
[15:13] forth but these rest in the spirit
[15:17] him
[15:21] [Music]
[15:40] [Applause]
[15:46] [Music]
[16:10] you remember many times that Paul was
[16:14] trying to go someplace take a nice way
[16:16] to have a great meeting
[16:18] but the spirit would forbid him now does
[16:22] that clearly State and prove that Paul
[16:25] was a prison yes amen a pleasure to
[16:28] Jesus Christ honest to his word by the
[16:31] spirit over our life Greg
[16:34] he was down
[16:37] he was found
[16:39] by chains about Affairs of Love they
[16:45] turned through the will of God in that
[16:47] only amen
[16:49] he was a prison he was an affordable law
[16:52] he was in the York with Christ amen he
[16:57] said your test was nothing else amen
[17:02] and one of the least once that's where
[17:04] he had to go because I'll bring the
[17:08] passwords on this side of that side he
[17:09] had to go all the way the leader in the
[17:12] Europeans
[17:13] ambition
[17:25] [Music]
[17:26] that we could completely surrender
[17:28] ourselves indeed you're killing
[17:31] no matter what the rest of the world
[17:33] thinks amen what the rest of the world
[17:35] does where is Yo
[17:37] with letters of love we are our prayers
[17:40] my peace is so yes to Christ it won't
[17:45] Bang
[17:47] my eyes are so just to cry
[17:50] when I see these modern striptease on
[17:53] the streets it turns my head
[17:57] and my heart is
[18:01] for this world anymore
[18:09] [Music]
[18:14] was correctly a prison he wasn't making
[18:17] any wrong statement
[18:19] he was trained by the Holy Ghost again
[18:22] the light on the word
[18:25] now he can train one baby but God has
[18:29] trained him another way now he was
[18:31] trained by the Holy Spirit to wait upon
[18:34] the law
[18:35] no matter what his Ambitions was
[18:38] a heart for the Holy Spirit show you
[18:41] something
[18:42] everybody
[18:44] now let's just take an instant one day
[18:46] Paul and Silas coming down the street in
[18:49] a certain city with his woman a Revival
[18:51] and a little demon-possessed girl
[18:56] just fine
[18:57] crying out entry
[18:59] and know about what Paul would know that
[19:03] he has the authority as an apostle
[19:06] to reduce that evil spirit out of that
[19:09] woman
[19:10] but did you notice he wanted his day
[19:13] after day
[19:15] after all of a sudden
[19:18] the holy spirit's also amen but this is
[19:22] the hour that he says now Spirit come
[19:26] out of them
[19:27] see he knows to wait on the Lord
[19:32] amen and therefore so many people that
[19:35] angry coach upon the world
[19:39] they go out with an ambition
[19:41] how many revivals have been with that
[19:44] because of a thing like that
[19:45] amen because
[19:47] to see what the Lord has got to say
[19:51] some of them said come over here
[19:53] because the association says go
[19:58] and the Holy Spirit would say something
[20:00] different yes the ambition of the man to
[20:04] become the State president era or
[20:06] something another or some uh there are
[20:10] some bishop or something which was doing
[20:13] you must go and yet he knows that in the
[20:16] Holy Spirit saying go here see he's
[20:18] yelled to his organization he's an
[20:21] adventure to the organization now if
[20:24] he's just
[20:30] Christopher no matter what anything else
[20:33] says it's a it's a sounding blast and a
[20:37] tinkling symbol yeah he is only the
[20:39] voice of God and he speaks only when he
[20:41] comes out he says nothing
[20:44] somebody say oh oh brother June
[20:48] uh the brother Roberts or something
[20:50] these great man in our land today
[20:54] like a tiny history or our own law
[20:57] officer are still the best honeography
[21:00] some of those great evanges it's not
[21:03] going to take say come over here call me
[21:06] you're a great man of God and I I got a
[21:11] uh Uncle it's raining over here it's all
[21:13] down
[21:15] and he's uh he said I would say come
[21:18] over I believe you are straight to
[21:21] Healing okay I know that the Holy Spirit
[21:24] would say to him not now
[21:27] but yet to the Friendship of that man
[21:31] he's Duty now to go with it uh he
[21:35] becomes an enemy to that name
[21:37] that man said well he went to sworn to
[21:39] us
[21:40] boy I know he did and I've been his
[21:43] friend for years
[21:45] and he wasn't coming to my place
[21:48] but if he's constrained that the Holy
[21:50] Spirit not to go he better not go Amen
[21:52] to God his friend he loves if you better
[21:56] be letting the holy spirit that won't do
[21:59] any good anyhow
[22:01] I experienced that so many times but
[22:04] Paul just waited for the spirit to tell
[22:07] him what to do man forever the spirit
[22:09] says he stood all night preaching and
[22:12] washed out there seen a crippled man and
[22:15] all the ones the spiritual King yeah and
[22:17] he said I perceived the same way he
[22:21] perceives it's going to be erect upon an
[22:23] island
[22:24] I perceive that you have facing in here
[22:28] [Music]
[22:35] nothing had happened but yet he waited
[22:39] for the Holy Spirit to save
[22:41] see he was yoked to that appeal
[22:44] now you say brother then you're
[22:45] condemning that you said Sunday about
[22:47] you've been waiting all this time to
[22:49] you remember it was the Holy Spirit
[22:51] that spoke to me yesterday on their own
[22:52] instead of sending you back him up to
[22:54] stick in this place amen it's obedience
[22:56] to the Holy Spirit sure I didn't go
[22:59] until he told me to do it I was waiting
[23:01] for a dust saith the Lord until I got
[23:03] thus saith the Lord
[23:05] now it makes a difference yes he waited
[23:09] for the word along he was pressed in the
[23:12] spirit to do only God's did
[23:16] that he become a prisoner
[23:19] of Jesus Christ
[23:22] friends if we could only come prison
[23:25] I was hot but I asked this the name a
[23:28] couple more characters
[23:35] let's take their character Moses
[23:38] he was uh born a deliverer
[23:42] and he he knew that that he was born a
[23:46] deliverer
[23:48] but before I say about Moses I like to
[23:51] make this statement that God always has
[23:54] to take any man that was serving truly
[23:56] to be his prison right now a man has to
[24:00] surrender every ambition he's got
[24:03] everything that he is
[24:05] every Everything Is My Soul bodies will
[24:09] Ambitions and everything else can become
[24:11] a complete a pleasure to Christ who is
[24:15] the word
[24:17] serve God
[24:19] you might have to walk contrary you're a
[24:21] better judgment maybe there's a certain
[24:23] organization you might think if they
[24:25] could lift you up and give you something
[24:26] good it's you my Express but what do you
[24:29] find yourself you find yourself defeated
[24:32] after a while until God can get a man
[24:35] that's willing to become a pleasure to
[24:38] him
[24:40] God is looking for prisoners
[24:43] he's always done you might search it
[24:46] through the scripture a man has to be a
[24:49] prisoner to Christ
[24:51] [Music]
[24:52] or just anything therefore you cannot be
[24:55] connected with anything but Christ
[24:58] even your father your mother
[25:00] your brother your sister your husband
[25:02] your wife anybody
[25:03] your only connected with Christ and him
[25:06] only
[25:07] then God can use you I'm sorry and you
[25:10] can't
[25:13] go without sometimes speaks up what the
[25:17] people
[25:18] see I'm trying to get you to cut loose
[25:21] you're about to have a starting place my
[25:24] God sometimes calls out the women
[25:25] bothering Harry wearing these clothes
[25:27] and hold and maintain their Christian
[25:29] profession say that's a little bit well
[25:32] you gotta start throwing
[25:38] accomplish the worry lost anyhow and
[25:41] become a prisoner to Christ and they
[25:44] just keep on Cut Loose everything to
[25:45] find the last lines Cut Loose then you
[25:48] are a prisoner then you become in his
[25:50] grip he's got you in his grip now Moses
[25:55] know that he was born to deliver who
[25:57] knew that
[25:58] did you notice
[26:01] with the ambition that Moses had knowing
[26:04] his mother had told him oh yeah she was
[26:06] his nurse maid
[26:08] no doubt when Moses the little baby was
[26:10] born
[26:11] that his mother said you know Moses went
[26:15] your dad amaran and I pray constantly we
[26:21] know what it's seen in the word it was
[26:23] time for the coming of the deliverance
[26:25] and we pray Lord God we want to see that
[26:29] deliver
[26:30] one night the Lord had told us an
[26:32] invasion that you would be born
[26:34] and you would be that over we wasn't
[26:37] afraid of the king's commandment we
[26:38] didn't care what the king said then we
[26:40] know that you were born a dilemma

[27:10] away and turned it right into Pharaoh's
[27:12] Palace where his uh the famous daughter
[27:15] was uh where the dating crew up and held
[27:19] it and I know that she'd need a woman to
[27:22] raise it and in them days of course they
[27:24] didn't have these applies to raise the
[27:27] babies on so did that have a wet nurse
[27:29] so and marry him I snapped her down and
