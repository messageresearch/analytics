[26:35] brother walker from
[26:38] from liberia called earlier this week
[26:42] or somebody last week i spoke with him
[26:45] it's been a while that i spoke with them
[26:47] and after
[26:50] we been working with them for the little
[26:53] baiting
[26:54] and but i've been hearing everything
[26:56] that's been going on there
[26:58] but the prada is working closely with
[27:00] them but the lord has been gracious to
[27:02] them
[27:02] in in the area he wanted to give me some
[27:05] report
[27:06] of the the growth of the church and also
[27:09] the work in that area and
[27:12] and the lord has has been able to
[27:16] bless the work in that area right now
[27:19] he's running between
[27:22] [Music]
[27:23] i think his church or five different
[27:26] churches in the area he's running
[27:28] between now
[27:30] and and then when he called me
[27:33] last week they have started a little
[27:35] radio broadcast
[27:37] and there is another uh preacher of the
[27:40] denomination that have been following
[27:42] the radio
[27:43] so he was going to be leaving the next
[27:45] day to preach for them
[27:47] because the man has come down over to
[27:50] the church follow some of the service
[27:52] he and his wife and and a group of them
[27:55] from the church were going to be
[27:56] baptized amen
[27:58] so we want to thank the law for the
[28:00] growth of the work in that area praise
[28:01] the lord
[28:03] the brothers so i abandoned them but i
[28:05] told them no i just wanted to be quiet
[28:07] for a while amen
[28:09] and and just look at some few things
[28:11] around myself
[28:13] and uh so uh uh those are the
[28:17] the praise report that we have tonight
[28:19] but then
[28:20] uh experiencing some pain in his back
[28:24] he's gonna do an mri this evening that's
[28:26] why he and his family are not in church
[28:28] you want us to remember him in prayer
[28:30] and
[28:31] [Music]
[28:38] i don't want to go blank here now praise
[28:40] the lord
[28:41] but that is a prayer request that i have
[28:44] okay this is what i wanted to say next
[28:47] week
[28:47] as we were hoping that we will
[28:51] we will have a convenient service
[28:53] towards the end of the week
[28:54] we will announce how the service will be
[28:57] maybe by sunday or wednesday
[28:59] but uh what is omaha is that we have to
[29:02] realize that
[29:05] as as a people and also as a nation
[29:08] we are facing an election in this
[29:11] oncoming week
[29:13] we're not preaching politics we are not
[29:15] campaigning
[29:16] for any party besides jesus party amen
[29:20] but the the truth about the matter that
[29:22] is that this is where we live
[29:24] amen and being christians filled with
[29:28] the holy ghost
[29:29] there is no way we can escape what would
[29:31] become the outcome of the election
[29:34] so we want to pray and the thing about
[29:36] it there is the other
[29:38] you know whoever that that uh that god
[29:41] allowed to be there he's going to be the
[29:44] man that is going to be driven by
[29:46] by prophecy that's what i believe amen
[29:49] because prophecy is the one driving our
[29:51] time
[29:52] but there is just a lot of unrest there
[29:55] is i mean there is just a lot of things
[29:57] in the air
[29:58] and and and you know brother branham
[30:00] says god plays certain things
[30:02] set in power in the church the church is
[30:04] the moon
[30:05] that reflects the light of the sun the
[30:08] sun
[30:09] controls the bottom life
[30:12] the flower the trees and all of the
[30:14] earth the moon
[30:16] control the life under the sea
[30:20] under the sea all those things that are
[30:22] in the dark areas that you can see
[30:24] those powers are controlled by the
[30:26] church amen
[30:28] so uh uh i want us to just
[30:32] just pray them you know as individuals
[30:35] and we having loved ones we have
[30:37] uh relatives that are not safe they are
[30:39] not born again they don't have the holy
[30:41] ghost
[30:42] and uh and what whatever is going to
[30:44] happen
[30:45] you know they will have a way of looking
[30:46] at it but as church
[30:48] as believers as christians even as the
[30:51] word of god
[30:51] required us to pray for our leaders we
[30:54] just want to
[30:55] just pray that god would give us this
[30:57] this peace you know
[30:59] i mean the fear the the all the
[31:04] propaganda whatever on the media all of
[31:06] those things will not affect
[31:08] us because we are looking to a kingdom
[31:11] to come

[39:25] reading
[39:25] a quote from jehovah jairo i was
[39:29] i was i had a thought on speaking
[39:41] on the on the little subject has been on
[39:43] my heart
[39:44] for the wednesday night but uh
[39:48] this thought tonight caught my attention
[39:52] uh after the service on sunday
[39:56] we had a little time of prayer
[39:59] and one of our sister came up
[40:05] and she needed a prayer for her child
[40:07] and we prayed
[40:09] and i woke up this morning
[40:12] early this morning and
[40:15] to have some time of praying
[40:20] and after i got to praying i went back
[40:22] in the room and started playing
[40:24] the message jehovah jarrah because of
[40:27] what i was on my heart
[40:28] i wanted to talk about and i hope that
[40:32] we'll have the grace to be able to talk
[40:34] about it
[40:35] as the lord will will lead us and then i
[40:38] was
[40:39] listening to the message and then while
[40:42] listening
[40:43] there brother branham said this i want
[40:45] to re read this to you
[40:47] he said jehovah jarrah he says
[40:51] and in the room a vision came
[40:54] and i went to the table where the
[40:56] sisters were sitting
[40:57] present noun was i said
[41:01] i saw a vision of a little girl
[41:04] just about so high
[41:08] long-headed and
[41:11] and she's destined to die today
[41:15] in a wreck in a black
[41:19] automobile
[41:24] i said he had told me
[41:29] to pray for the child
[41:33] that this will be bypass
[41:38] i want to take that again i saw the
[41:41] vision of a little girl just about
[41:44] so high blonde headed and she was
[41:47] destined
[41:48] to die today in a wreck
[41:52] in a black automobile
[41:56] i said in here and he told me to pray
[41:59] for the child that this will be
[42:03] bypassed and i said
[42:06] and and i have i said
[42:09] it's thus said the lord you will hear
[42:13] your year of it in the next
[42:16] two or three days
[42:19] and the same hour
[42:23] the lovely little girl of that home
[42:28] was out in an automobile
[42:31] world just barely escaped death
[42:35] was brought back safely
[42:38] how our heavenly father just marvelous
[42:43] then we were sitting uh just a while ago
[42:47] and talking about it those things happen
[42:50] all the time and different things
[42:54] amen so uh uh
[42:58] and it caught my attention because uh i
[43:01] was i was
[43:02] once again i was going over uh uh
[43:05] you know when and remembering the need
[43:07] that the sister mentioned to me and
[43:09] praying about it
[43:10] and then uh i went there lied down
[43:12] trying to
[43:14] to meditate on the word and and and
[43:16] listening to brother branham
[43:17] and he and he said this and for some
[43:20] reason it just kind of
[43:21] caught my spirit so uh
[43:29] uh i think i noted it or something like
[43:31] that and and
[43:32] kept on listening to message and and did
[43:34] different things
[43:36] and then i came by uh at church and uh
[43:39] to study it and prayed a little bit and
[43:41] i said let me read that again
[43:44] and when i read it the word bypass
[43:48] caught my mind i want to talk tonight on
[43:50] a great bypass
[43:53] the word bypass caught my mind let me
[43:56] read another
[43:57] uh
[44:01] quote from hebrew
[44:04] the message hebrew chapter seven brother
[44:07] branham said
[44:08] listen to this and i thank you you and
[44:11] my
[44:11] we all we appreciate it he said coming
[44:13] true illinois
[44:16] and made a little slight turn
[44:20] not noticing that the sun
[44:24] was behind us instead
[44:28] of from us
[44:31] we was glory enough instead of south the
[44:36] first thing
[44:37] you know cross a road i said
[44:41] this on the right road look down there
[44:46] and come to find out we were
[44:49] 50 miles out of the way
[44:53] going right straight back
[44:58] then when we come back
[45:01] we were talking i said you know why
[45:04] the lord might have bypassed us
[45:09] this way to keep us from having
[45:12] a horrible accident down here somewhere
[45:17] that that might have done something
[45:20] otherwise
[45:22] we know that all things work together
[45:25] for good to them the law of the lord
[45:30] that's all we have to keep
[45:34] on our mind praise the lord
[45:38] instead of fussing at the driver ahead
[45:41] of you
[45:43] instead of fussing at the red light
[45:45] instead of being angry
[45:47] with the traffic the lord
[45:51] may have kept you may have
[45:54] caused you to take another route the
[45:57] lord
[45:58] might have put you into
[46:03] his great bypass
[46:06] program praise the lord
[46:10] let's stand on our feet in john chapter
[46:12] one
[46:28] it really kind of forgot my attention
[46:30] this morning
[46:34] that god would give a vision
[46:37] concerning the little girl that was
[46:40] going to die
[46:41] she was destined to die brother branham
[46:43] said
[46:45] but yet god will put it on his heart for
[46:49] him to pray
[46:50] for her to bypass that
[46:54] praise the lord
[46:57] just like god told isaiah to tell
[46:59] hezekiah to put his house in order
[47:03] but god had to bypass that 15 years
[47:06] praise the lord saint john chapter 1.
[47:12] in the beginning was the word
[47:17] and the word was with god and the word
[47:19] was gone
[47:22] the same was in the beginning with god
[47:26] all things were made by him and without
[47:29] him
[47:30] was not anything made that was me
[47:35] praise the lord then we dropped down to
[47:39] to verse 14 and the word
[47:43] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[47:48] and we beheld his glory the glory
[47:52] as of the only begotten of
[47:55] the father full of grace and truth
[48:00] dear lord jesus we just commit ourselves
[48:03] in your hands tonight
[48:05] i pray that lord you will take this
[48:07] thought from my heart lord
[48:09] and by the inspiration of the holy
[48:11] spirit may something
[48:13] of internal value be said tonight
[48:16] that will draw us closer to you father
[48:20] made uh your word oh god we know we have
[48:23] a promise of this word
[48:25] be made flesh help us tonight lord in
[48:28] jesus name we pray
[48:29] amen praise the lord the lord bless you
[48:33] amen
[48:40] i got like i said i got caught up in the
[48:42] top
[48:43] and left what i was studying
[48:47] and uh try to look into this tonight so
[48:52] if i don't do a good job tonight then i
[48:55] know that
[48:56] uh you know it's it's one of those
[48:59] things
[49:00] but it's not it's not a good job
[49:04] you know to impress you we are doing a
[49:07] good job for the father amen
[49:09] he's the one that we want him to say
[49:12] that it's a good job
[49:13] praise the lord tonight i want to talk
[49:16] about a great bypass
[49:18] now you already seen where my mind is
[49:22] with this uh bypass you know
[49:25] all things work together for good to
[49:27] them that love the lord
[49:29] but uh one of the
[49:32] one of the commonplace in the message
[49:35] that brother branham
[49:36] make mention about the bad past with
[49:39] this
[49:40] electricity we hear brother branham
[49:42] saying we bypass our
[49:44] tear funding amen and
[49:47] and that kind of for catch our attention
[49:49] it catches the ego's eye
[49:51] we bypass our tear funding that becomes
[49:54] a language that we use over and over
[49:58] but let me read this he also said in
[50:00] that message
[50:01] that is where i want to take my
[50:03] inspiration from tonight
[50:05] he says now we see
[50:08] here plainly the complete
[50:12] secret of our life
[50:16] in joining as we about to talk about
[50:20] this bypass
[50:22] i want you to remember that
[50:26] brother man i'm talking about all of
[50:27] this he's talking about predestination
[50:29] he's talking about
[50:30] you know uh being in the mind of god
[50:33] being in a thought of god he says
[50:35] if you are not in the thought of god
[50:37] there is no way you can become
[50:38] word there is no way you can become a
[50:40] you that you don't have a tio funny
[50:43] because it is the thought of god but as
[50:45] he's talking on this
[50:47] he comes to this statement and says now
[50:50] we
[50:50] see here plainly the complete
[50:53] secret of our lives in joining
[50:57] just like he was traveling from illinois
[51:00] wherever he was going
[51:01] he missed his way and he found himself
[51:04] going back instead of going this way
[51:07] i don't know what i'm going south or not
[51:08] but in a way
[51:10] praise the lord instead of going south
[51:12] he finds himself going exactly to where
[51:14] he came from
[51:15] and when he got himself back
[51:19] he says well i think maybe the lord
[51:22] allow
[51:22] us in this journey for us to bypass
[51:26] setting trouble and yerey said he's
[51:28] comparing here
[51:30] the uh uh our complete
[51:34] secret of our life he says this shows
[51:37] plainly the secret of our life in
[51:40] joining
[51:43] from the mind of god
[51:46] back to the mind of god amen from the
[51:49] mind of god
[51:50] back to the presence of god let me say
[51:51] that way
[51:53] amen because we're not going back to
[51:55] touch amen
[51:56] we're going to work for him amen praise
[51:59] the lord
[51:59] so he says our the complete secret of
[52:02] our life in journey
[52:04] and death and where we go
[52:07] after we die praise the lord
[52:12] amen predestination
[52:16] is in plain view here now listing
[52:19] as we teach this closely so we're not
[52:22] talking on the wall
[52:24] is this uh uh uh in the metastatic we're
[52:27] talking about the great bypass
[52:29] now so as i was thinking on on the
[52:32] scripture i couldn't help but think
[52:34] about
[52:34] uh this comment brother brandon make
[52:37] over in who is this uh mexic
[52:41] about bypassing our tio funny and this
[52:44] scripture came to my mind in john
[52:46] chapter one in the beginning was the
[52:48] word
[52:48] and the word was with god and the word
[52:50] was god
[52:52] and yet in verse 14 the bible says and
[52:54] the word
[52:56] become flesh now because it's a prayer
[52:59] meeting tonight
[53:00] i might just use this platform to kind
[53:02] of lay the foundation here
[53:04] and maybe if the lord help us will pick
[53:06] it up as we travel the lawn
[53:08] but in the beginning was the word
[53:12] amen and we know
[53:15] that a word is a thought express
[53:20] praise the lord amen
[53:24] but you look at this
[53:27] the word that was in the beginning
[53:32] become flesh
[53:37] the word become flesh
[53:41] it's so easy we caught it like that the
[53:43] world become flesh
[53:45] just like john said
[53:48] amen we caught it so easy the word
[53:52] become flesh
[53:52] and dwelt among us the world become
[53:55] flesh
[53:56] endure among us but there is a process
[54:01] that was bypassed
[54:05] just like brother branham said there is
[54:07] there is
[54:08] a lot the secret of our life journey
[54:14] the secret of our life journey
[54:18] is in the bypass
[54:23] praise the lord amen
[54:27] for us to be here tonight there are a
[54:30] lot of things that we have to bypass
[54:33] and i believe that god works in the
[54:35] bypass
[54:37] the reason why i believe that is because
[54:40] jesus when he came to the earth
[54:46] his first ministry i mean the first
[54:48] miracle
[54:49] sorry praise the lord amen
[54:54] brother branham says at that word he
[54:56] says first
[54:58] he turned the water to wine
[55:01] now the water will
[55:04] have been wine some days anyhow perhaps
[55:09] but it will have to go
[55:12] through the regular procedure
[55:16] of going up into a grip vine coming out
[55:22] into a grape and being brought back
[55:26] and so far like that jesus
[55:30] just bypassed all of that process
[55:35] he bypassed all of that process but
[55:38] madam says
[55:39] that water something was going to be
[55:41] wine
[55:42] if a white vine was planted and the
[55:44] water the seed
[55:45] the water the seed the water the seed
[55:48] the roots would suck it up
[55:49] it would suck it up the van would grow
[55:52] and fruit would come
[55:53] they would pluck they would plug the
[55:55] fruit they would cut it
[55:57] they would press it and everything
[55:59] before it would they would go through
[56:00] all the process
[56:01] it will have to ferment it in everything
[56:03] all of that process
[56:07] but when jesus came
[56:11] he took the water
[56:14] and bypass all of that process
[56:21] and gave them wine
[56:24] the secret of your journey
[56:29] it's in the bypass
[56:38] are we together
[56:43] the regular procedure was going up into
[56:46] a grip vine coming out
[56:48] and and and and bring forward back and
[56:50] so forth like that
[56:52] jesus just bypassed all of that
[56:56] because he was the god
[56:59] of nature amen
[57:04] can we say praise the lord tonight
[57:07] can we give the lord a hand of praise
[57:10] amen thank you jesus
[57:13] thank you jesus
[57:16] thank you jesus when the scripture says
[57:21] everything worked together for good
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:27] to them that love the lord it is by his
[57:31] mercy
[57:32] that we are not consumed
[57:35] we have no idea of what is happening
[57:39] in the back path
[57:43] sometimes we complain why is it not
[57:46] happening
[57:46] why is it not this time we we just
[57:48] complain we we get stuck up
[57:50] what's happening in front of maybe this
[57:53] guy
[57:54] make an accident they're just running
[57:56] they can't take time
[57:57] wasting my time
[58:02] i just got five minutes all of these
[58:04] young boys they would not drive straight
[58:11] and
[58:15] the city immersion emergency truck comes
[58:18] and put an arrow
[58:19] every car go this way oh my goodness
[58:22] we're gonna
[58:24] take me from on the road again i have to
[58:25] go all the way behind the city and and
[58:28] and our vein is just balling and we have
[58:32] no
[58:34] idea
[58:36] why the bypass
[58:41] praise the lord
[58:45] yes a little girl here
[58:50] the lord gave brother branham the vision
[58:54] that she was going to die in the wreck
[59:00] and the injured of the lord shall wake
[59:01] up and pray for her
[59:04] amen she was destined to die today
[59:10] in iraq in a black automobile which
[59:14] means
[59:14] he saw the vision
[59:18] amen
[59:22] and he told me to pray for the child
[59:25] that this will be a bypass
[59:32] we are not we are not uh we don't have
[59:34] the gift
[59:35] of of a prophet but sometimes god speaks
[59:39] to us in dreams
[59:43] and uh sometimes we have dreams
[59:48] and then sometimes people become
[59:51] terrified
[59:52] they want to block it away from their
[59:54] mind
[59:56] what god has ordained will happen
[1:00:02] praise the lord amen
[1:00:08] and sometimes we don't even have we
[1:00:10] don't even dream about anything and
[1:00:11] things happen
[1:00:13] are we together amen but what i'm trying
[1:00:16] to grab your mind
[1:00:18] told tonight is to be able to deal with
[1:00:21] the element of fear
[1:00:25] when we have dreams and and or whatever
[1:00:28] it is you know
[1:00:29] uh uh and and it looks frightening and
[1:00:32] it looks scary
[1:00:34] all you have to do is to just commit it
[1:00:35] to the lord
[1:00:37] and so just give it back to god
[1:00:41] i say lord i i don't know what what this
[1:00:43] means
[1:00:45] you don't have to make up interpretation
[1:00:51] no you don't have to you just give it to
[1:00:53] the lord you just prayed about it
[1:00:55] and said lord what whatever this is i
[1:00:57] committed into your hands
[1:00:59] if it is evil that will befall my
[1:01:01] brother lord may that bypass him
[1:01:05] amen i just believe it's a it's a it's a
[1:01:08] christian principle
[1:01:10] that the lord want to teach us here
[1:01:13] that's why he had brother branham come
[1:01:15] out and say these things to those people
[1:01:18] praise the lord but beside that
[1:01:22] we're going here verb just preached
[1:01:25] martian davos in the morning before he
[1:01:28] preached this message
[1:01:30] and i was thinking about this today so i
[1:01:32] was driving i says oh my goodness
[1:01:35] oh my goodness lord jesus you just have
[1:01:37] to help us
[1:01:38] how many times we take these uh uh
[1:01:42] messages that brother brandon preach and
[1:01:45] you know we just get a cited
[1:01:47] in a code a verse or two and then i mean
[1:01:51] i mean it has it has i don't want to go
[1:01:53] into all of those things
[1:01:55] but to just see if sometimes you sit
[1:01:58] back and you just look and see
[1:02:00] think in your mind why he did this you
[1:02:02] know why
[1:02:03] why the lord allowed him to do that just
[1:02:05] after preaching
[1:02:06] marriage and divorce he comes in the
[1:02:09] evening
[1:02:09] and he preached this message woo it is
[1:02:12] mekistic
[1:02:13] praise the lord all because there cannot
[1:02:16] be a marriage
[1:02:17] if there is not a priest to perform the
[1:02:19] marriage
[1:02:21] i don't want to go into that tonight but
[1:02:23] let's let's just stay with the bypass
[1:02:29] so we see jesus his
[1:02:34] every first miracle he got down there to
[1:02:38] the way
[1:02:39] to to the wedding and there was no wine
[1:02:44] praise the lord and his mother
[1:02:48] said whatever you ask him he would do it
[1:02:53] and he went to jesus and he turned the
[1:02:56] water into wine
[1:03:02] the bible is telling us here that in the
[1:03:04] beginning was the word
[1:03:08] and the word
[1:03:11] took on flesh
[1:03:15] praise the lord the word
[1:03:18] took on flesh the fullness of the word
[1:03:20] that was in the beginning
[1:03:21] that logos that was in the beginning
[1:03:26] comes down to time and it takes on flesh
[1:03:30] now if you think about the word
[1:03:35] that i'm speaking to you and words are
[1:03:38] coming from my mouth
[1:03:39] for words to take on flesh there is a
[1:03:42] process
[1:03:46] praise the lord
[1:03:50] isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[1:03:55] god said my word do not go out and
[1:03:57] return to me involved that word that
[1:04:00] isaiah spoke it took 700 years
[1:04:06] praise the lord but even with that
[1:04:10] even with that even with the space of
[1:04:12] time the space of time is is not the
[1:04:14] problem
[1:04:16] and this i was i was meditating on this
[1:04:18] today i want to share with you
[1:04:19] we have to realize that god
[1:04:23] is not in our time
[1:04:27] god is out of our time
[1:04:31] he's not in our time cycle no
[1:04:34] that's why he can determine the end from
[1:04:37] the beginning
[1:04:40] amen knowing the end from the beginning
[1:04:44] is not just a slogan to say
[1:04:48] he knows everything but he knows exactly
[1:04:51] how it will end
[1:04:52] even before he thinks about how it will
[1:04:54] start
[1:04:56] he determine the end
[1:04:59] before he even think about how this
[1:05:01] thing will start
[1:05:05] he's out of our time zone
[1:05:11] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:05:14] he's not panicking
[1:05:17] he's not in a hurried
[1:05:22] praise the lord because he stepped into
[1:05:25] time
[1:05:26] and he stepped out of time
[1:05:34] are we together that's the reason why
[1:05:37] we can trust him
[1:05:40] that's why we can take him at his word
[1:05:48] we can trust him
[1:05:54] and not to be fearful
[1:05:57] because he have everything
[1:06:00] under control
[1:06:04] when he made a promise he give a promise
[1:06:09] he said this thing will happen he give
[1:06:11] his word
[1:06:12] a virgin shall conceive you know what
[1:06:16] happened
[1:06:16] he speaks to isaiah and say a virgin
[1:06:19] shall conceive
[1:06:20] all the other priests the the religious
[1:06:23] people are that they
[1:06:24] they make a council they are discussing
[1:06:26] it when they are talking
[1:06:28] god take the bypass
[1:06:31] he take another role behind him they are
[1:06:33] arguing no
[1:06:34] it's going to be the the first daughter
[1:06:37] it has to be the high priest daughter
[1:06:39] no it has to be i mean they are cutting
[1:06:43] because according to the to the torah
[1:06:46] and
[1:06:46] when they are doing all of that he takes
[1:06:49] the bypass
[1:06:50] you will see that in jesus ministry
[1:06:55] when jesus comes on the scene
[1:06:59] after he had performed a miracle or he
[1:07:02] he did
[1:07:03] something and and there was an uproar
[1:07:05] and the people he just slipped
[1:07:08] all right they are talking at first he
[1:07:10] slipped before they realized he on the
[1:07:12] other side he said somebody has got
[1:07:14] their sight
[1:07:16] everybody running there oh i thought he
[1:07:19] was here joseph where he went to
[1:07:28] the complete secret of our life
[1:07:32] journey
[1:07:35] is in the bypass
[1:07:40] there are a lot of things that god
[1:07:43] have to make us to bypass for us to be
[1:07:47] here tonight
[1:07:52] praise the lord many times we
[1:07:56] think we are walking on a straight and
[1:07:58] narrow way
[1:07:59] but you are actually in the bypass
[1:08:04] oh my goodness me praise the lord
[1:08:08] i'll read another quote to you tonight
[1:08:10] maybe if the lord help us we'll find
[1:08:12] some time to preach amen
[1:08:24] the lord and
[1:08:32] are we together
[1:08:40] brother branham
[1:08:45] sorry the brother jordan's just a fade i
[1:08:48] don't have this one out there i didn't i
[1:08:49] didn't add it to my
[1:08:51] my coast tonight but brother branham
[1:08:52] you're talking in the message paradox
[1:08:54] he says it was a paradise when a capital
[1:08:57] son by the name jesus of nazareth took
[1:08:59] up
[1:09:00] five little biscuit in two fish and fed
[1:09:05] five thousand people if it isn't
[1:09:09] i want to see somebody do that today
[1:09:14] i want you to explain to me what kind of
[1:09:17] an
[1:09:17] atom he let loose
[1:09:21] how he how he did do it not only the
[1:09:24] fish
[1:09:26] but the fish
[1:09:30] was grown the fish was
[1:09:33] was killed the fish was clean the fish
[1:09:35] was cooked
[1:09:41] amen he took the little boy
[1:09:46] lunch
[1:09:48] are we together
[1:09:52] five biscuits two fish
[1:09:56] to feed five thousand people
[1:10:00] in another quote brother branham says we
[1:10:02] call it miracle
[1:10:04] he said we call it miracle
[1:10:08] he said well if you if you if you if you
[1:10:11] stop
[1:10:12] and think about it
[1:10:17] if you stop and think about it it's not
[1:10:20] that
[1:10:20] he he break the fish small
[1:10:23] like we do our communion bread so
[1:10:26] everybody can get a piece
[1:10:28] and as soon as they ate it their stomach
[1:10:30] was fought
[1:10:33] the bible says there were baskets left
[1:10:38] basket left the arabian was picked up
[1:10:42] and put in baskets
[1:10:49] which means he bypass
[1:10:52] the normal order right verbum
[1:10:59] for a fish to be caught
[1:11:03] still clean seasoned
[1:11:07] fried
[1:11:10] he's standing right there right there
[1:11:12] before then he bypassed that order
[1:11:15] for a week to grow
[1:11:18] and the wheat is grind
[1:11:22] and made out of flour
[1:11:26] and all the ingredients ingredients that
[1:11:28] was popped
[1:11:29] into the cake it was backpacks
[1:11:34] the hunger people were sitting there
[1:11:36] they were hungry they were looking at
[1:11:38] him
[1:11:38] he took the thread in his hands
[1:11:42] he lifted up
[1:11:57] when the human mind cannot factor
[1:12:02] the unimportance
[1:12:09] when we are lack of words
[1:12:18] the fish was cooked the fish
[1:12:22] was whatever it was the bread was
[1:12:24] planted a grove
[1:12:26] and all of its backpacks god turned
[1:12:31] it from a cokefish
[1:12:38] he just brought it out and broke it off
[1:12:42] and brought it out and broke it up and
[1:12:45] grew it out
[1:12:46] and broke it off
[1:13:03] the bible says he fed it was twelve
[1:13:05] thousand i mean five thousand men
[1:13:08] not counting the women and the children
[1:13:16] but yeah there were 12 baskets that was
[1:13:30] left
[1:13:44] is
[1:13:58] foreign
[1:14:04] praise the lord and it sounded good in
[1:14:06] my ears
[1:14:12] amen
[1:14:16] and watch now when jesus fed the mutter
[1:14:20] to you
[1:14:22] it's in john chapter 6
[1:14:26] it was worth his ministry has come to a
[1:14:29] crossroad
[1:14:32] his ministry was coming to an end
[1:14:37] that's what brother branham said he had
[1:14:39] to say a high thing to them except you
[1:14:42] eat my flesh
[1:14:43] and you drink my blood so he did it at
[1:14:47] the beginning of his ministry
[1:14:50] and he did it at the end just before his
[1:14:52] ministry could change
[1:14:56] he showed the bypass just in a very
[1:14:59] little way
[1:15:04] praise the lord amen
[1:15:09] if you look all true history
[1:15:14] just think about this tonight think
[1:15:17] about it
[1:15:18] meditate on it the complete secret
[1:15:21] of our life journey
[1:15:25] the complete secret of our life journey
[1:15:29] from thought
[1:15:33] to word
[1:15:40] it was in the bypass
[1:15:45] are we together
[1:15:50] that god in this in this day
[1:15:53] brother branham over and over he said it
[1:15:55] there i couldn't i couldn't get all this
[1:15:56] stuff i mean
[1:15:57] i was just i was just so i was so caught
[1:16:00] up i was so
[1:16:01] it just it just hit me and i just i was
[1:16:04] just thinking about it i said
[1:16:06] oh god
[1:16:10] and i sometimes we we we we make these
[1:16:13] things little we just turned him into a
[1:16:15] message to preach
[1:16:16] or turn him into something to be excited
[1:16:19] about
[1:16:20] but when you just sit down and you just
[1:16:22] think about it
[1:16:28] right there in in sisterheady wright
[1:16:32] house
[1:16:35] two boys that were that was just uh uh
[1:16:38] uh uh running girl stubborn boys
[1:16:43] brother brown says axe whatever
[1:16:47] if it does not fall right in your lap
[1:16:49] then call me the false prophet
[1:16:54] after after she was she was honored such
[1:16:58] an intense reverence to what brother
[1:17:01] branham was saying because brother brahm
[1:17:02] said
[1:17:03] as he was narrating the story the house
[1:17:05] was
[1:17:06] quiet
[1:17:09] and under that intense reverence she
[1:17:11] said brother branham this is
[1:17:13] nothing but the truth
[1:17:20] praise the lord
[1:17:33] and the lord told brother branham
[1:17:36] whatever she asked for
[1:17:37] he said if he does not fall in your lap
[1:17:41] call me the false praise the lord
[1:17:45] and there in her house
[1:17:48] god did the bypass
[1:17:54] those two stubborn little boys
[1:18:02] sometimes we think it's in our hands
[1:18:07] praise the lord we think salvation is in
[1:18:11] our hands
[1:18:12] or it's in our power or is by the way we
[1:18:15] preach the word you need to be preaching
[1:18:17] on repentance you need to preach the
[1:18:18] word high
[1:18:20] sometimes we think that's it
[1:18:23] but god did not put his salvation plan
[1:18:26] in any man's hands
[1:18:29] it's not in any man's ministry
[1:18:37] but bran says when god wanted to save
[1:18:40] men
[1:18:40] right from the beginning when adam felt
[1:18:43] it was god himself that came down
[1:18:45] he never sent an angel he never sent a
[1:18:48] messenger he didn't send a preacher
[1:18:50] he came down if god was save
[1:18:53] a sinner on the street by using you to
[1:18:57] preach god has to come down
[1:19:05] god has to calm down if god
[1:19:09] will heal a person in the service i will
[1:19:12] lay my hands
[1:19:13] but god has to calm down because he is
[1:19:15] the healer
[1:19:16] if god will deliver the person a
[1:19:19] preacher
[1:19:20] will preach it can even be from a
[1:19:22] singing of a song
[1:19:24] god will come down and he will do the
[1:19:34] work
[1:19:36] he never sent an angel he never sent a
[1:19:40] second person
[1:19:42] for it was god in christ
[1:19:46] reconciling the word it was
[1:19:50] god in christ
[1:19:53] god in the virgin bomb body
[1:19:58] reconciling the word to himself
[1:20:03] and it has to be god in you
[1:20:08] it has to be god in me
[1:20:16] praise the lord
[1:20:20] right there god bypass he
[1:20:24] baptized church order
[1:20:27] he bypassed the major doctrine your
[1:20:29] doctrine
[1:20:30] of sanctification justification
[1:20:33] baptising of the holy ghost that we we
[1:20:35] cram in our head
[1:20:39] he bypass it right there before the eyes
[1:20:43] of all of the deacons were there
[1:20:45] brother tony one of the deacon brother
[1:20:46] brandon says that brother tony and one
[1:20:48] of the deacons they were all sitting on
[1:20:49] there
[1:20:55] he bypassed auto call
[1:21:02] he bapting for the reading of the word
[1:21:05] there was no standing for the reading of
[1:21:07] the word all she had to say
[1:21:10] the salvation of my sons he said i gave
[1:21:13] it to you
[1:21:18] they didn't have to go for baptism or
[1:21:20] class
[1:21:22] they didn't have to come through the
[1:21:24] channel of your doctrinal mind
[1:21:28] god bypass the natural church process
[1:21:31] and give those two boys the baptising of
[1:21:34] the holy ghost
[1:21:35] and if god said there will be a bride
[1:21:38] without spot or wrinkle it will not come
[1:21:40] through your church doctrine it will not
[1:21:42] come true the way you think
[1:21:48] for the mother of fire we were already
[1:21:50] born in sin shipley in iniquity
[1:21:53] so for for god to make that promise
[1:21:56] he had to bypass our natural birth
[1:22:00] oh my goodness i feel like preaching
[1:22:02] tonight
[1:22:03] but i'm not going to preach i'm not
[1:22:06] going to preach

[1:22:19] listen to me a little bit
[1:22:33] we get so caught up
[1:22:37] in everything we know about ourself and
[1:22:40] sometimes it's become so hard for you to
[1:22:42] counsel some people
[1:22:43] you get them on the phone or you're
[1:22:45] talking to them trying to counsel them
[1:22:47] and just trying to show them a promise
[1:22:49] in the world that you can stand on
[1:22:53] that you can hotel no but you know no
[1:22:56] and in my no in my
[1:23:04] and we want god to work the way our kind
[1:23:07] of mind thinks
[1:23:09] we try to bring him down to the way our
[1:23:13] kind of mind
[1:23:14] when the bible says the kind of mind is
[1:23:18] enemy to god
[1:23:22] we try to reduce god down to our human
[1:23:25] mind
[1:23:28] until we want to use grammar verb and
[1:23:32] adverb

[1:35:32] never been able to know that yet
[1:35:38] you have never been able to know that
[1:35:41] yet
[1:35:42] so as long as you are in this life there
[1:35:45] are things that will be kept from you
[1:35:53] you will not know why you have to go
[1:35:54] down the setting street
[1:36:00] you would not know why you had to turn a
[1:36:02] setting corner
[1:36:04] sometimes you turn right and it says

[1:36:08] u-turn to go back
[1:36:12] you get angry with the gps don't get
[1:36:13] angry with the gps
[1:36:16] don't get angry with the gps

[1:36:24] for good
[1:36:28] are we together let's read this let's
[1:36:30] read this this is the thing i want to
[1:36:31] read and i
[1:36:32] find myself talking should be reading
[1:36:37] amen that's what i said i should be
[1:36:39] reading and never say i want to give
[1:36:40] testimony
[1:36:42] should be reading keep your eyes in the
[1:36:43] bible brother warren
[1:36:48] for whom he did for known he also did
[1:36:51] predestinate
[1:36:53] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:36:57] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:37:00] many bredwings
[1:37:01] moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:37:06] them also
[1:37:10] then he also called
[1:37:13] and whom he called then he
[1:37:16] also justified and whom he justified
[1:37:21] then he also glorified but where is your
[1:37:25] sanctification
[1:37:27] it's supposed to be justification
[1:37:29] sanctification
[1:37:31] baptism of the holy ghost where is she
[1:37:33] where is it
[1:37:35] right here paul is showing you that
[1:37:37] there is a bypass
[1:37:45] there is a bypass when he calls you when
[1:37:48] that
[1:37:49] initial call comes and you receive it
[1:37:53] then god start working in the bypass
[1:38:00] then we we get to this place no i'm
[1:38:03] justified
[1:38:04] i'm i'm sanctified no i'm i was
[1:38:06] justified before i'm centrifugable it
[1:38:08] looks like i'm still
[1:38:09] justified i've now become identified
[1:38:14] i mean i'm in the i'm in the test stage
[1:38:17] of grace
[1:38:17] i have faith now i've grown to vet you
[1:38:20] now i'm i'm asking the lord to give me
[1:38:22] knowledge
[1:38:23] we we try to make those things
[1:38:27] as literal things that we that we
[1:38:30] literally grow
[1:38:31] into it comes as a package
[1:38:38] just like when a child is born little
[1:38:41] grace down there
[1:38:43] she's just a little baby but everything
[1:38:46] that she needs to be
[1:38:47] a mother is already in her
[1:38:52] her parents don't have to shopping when
[1:38:54] she become five years old
[1:38:56] to go and shopping for five years old
[1:38:59] idea
[1:39:00] five years old behavior all they need to
[1:39:04] do
[1:39:04] is feed her right and keep her honor the
[1:39:08] right atmosphere
[1:39:10] and then the seed the thing that is in
[1:39:13] the sea
[1:39:13] will come to life
[1:39:17] that's all the believer needs to do feed
[1:39:19] on the world
[1:39:20] and stay in the right atmosphere get out
[1:39:24] of
[1:39:24] all of those ugly and unclean atmosphere
[1:39:27] say in the atmosphere of the world and
[1:39:30] the
[1:39:30] life that is in the sea will come up
[1:39:36] brother branham had to dramatize those
[1:39:38] things so we can get a picture of it
[1:39:44] he that he predestinated for new and
[1:39:48] called
[1:39:49] justified by faith has already been
[1:39:52] glorified
[1:39:59] let's stand together tonight musicians
