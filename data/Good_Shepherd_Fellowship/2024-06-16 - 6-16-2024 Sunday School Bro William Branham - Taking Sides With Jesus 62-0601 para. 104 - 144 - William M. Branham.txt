========================================
for [Music] the [Music] [Music] puning away right now I throw a shell in it it fires there it is if it don't fire I won't quit I'll throw that one out of the thud and try another one one of them's going to go off that's all there is to it one of them's go to fire somewhere then I I want to be on the target so when it does fire I'll hit the object that I'm shooting at and I you know what I mean I'm sure they there's something somewhere I'm leaving for these meetings just plunging out on her I don't aim to teach these great things I teach you people you remember what that dream that I got the interpretation was go back and store up food where was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here anywhere that will compare with the message that we have now of course our little brothers here that's out along here these other little churches are us we are one where would you go to to find it short it's comparison anywhere you go right out denominational Creed you'll go right out away from the name of the Lord Jesus you go right out away from these other things see here's where the food's been stored up well one message that I preach here to you all look I've been preaching from 1 to 6 hours till you on a message yeah well if I had to use one of those message I'd take a week to take it just a little bit here and a little bit there see because it's been stored up here it's on tapes it'll go worldwide on the tapes where people in their houses them tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinated of God Amen he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to its course that's the reason he sent me back to do this store up the food here you forbid me to go overseas brother argum might said come go you got one night but we'll take you a tours trip all around over the country the way I seen brother Fred and brother Banks trying to go I said I wouldn't go that way see it showed that there was something else I pressed right up to the mark now but I don't know which way to go but the examination laying all around me did he call me back to the evangelism has he called me to foreign missionaries has he called me to be his Prophet I'm a pastor somewhere whatever I'm to do do I just keep throwing shell in and pulling a hammer on it one of them will go off but I'm just not going to stay and look say Lord you put the shell in the gun I'm going to put the shell in the gun do the pulling myself let him do the firing he's the one to take care of that let me just keep moving on when I go on this meetings now I'm just going out I don't know I may not say one thing about these message like a preacher I may not even have one night of discernment I don't know I'm I'm just going not knowing what I'm going to do I couldn't tell you I'm just going and that's all and that's what you have to do you have got something in mind the people here wants a church build it as quick as you can get it up get your teachers and things you brother not your little churches and you want to you're doing a work God will reward you for that go out there preach do everything you can that all of you get together you bunch of man and have meetings and talk on deep things of the scripture and pray don't don't just come here together unless you come for prayer meeting alone do your praying in secret stay out in a placees go into your rooms hide out somewhere and just kneel down and just stay before God and stay there then if you find out look like something's moving up or you're just going and you find out it gets a little bit off the word and be careful no matter how good it looks stop right there a wrong Spirit struck you because the message of this day is to the word don't see if you say oh my brother brand I tell you so and so while so and so stood the other night this thing take place like this watch it watch it close don't renounce nothing just wait and see how it acts and then bring it up to the word and see how it Compares with the word then if it Compares with the word and everything's fine thank God and just keep moving on and see just long as it stays in the word that's my opinion what I think you should do brother Neville brother rutle brother chce and brother beer and all you Brethren here juny wherever you are and the rest of you Brethren God richly bless you I see Terry Lynn Charlie Cox David a lot of you young man here God anoint you amen my I would like to pick up a hand of you be evangelism and set you somewhere see knowing that you come up you can stand and know the message and study to prove yourself you feel a call in your life I see two or three young men four or five sitting in a roll back here and and like that you're a young man I'm getting old brother Neville's getting old we're a middle-aged man if time rolls on we're going to walk off the scene at while you've got to fill our shoes see and and so you seeing that maybe in that day even it'll be growing greater if there is a tomorrow but while there is a today let's work why day tomorrow may never come if it does let be ready for it see what I mean now that's what I would than to you would it be wonderful to see a brother up there from udica Brother chce All You other Brethren Here Come Together meet come in a place you ministers set together and discuss things you've got to have Fellowship somewhere you've got to have something to come together to kind of get together about you all come together as a group of men and believe one with the other and like that and discuss these problems and set out maybe once a month just ministers alone let you meet somewhere in one of your churches sit there and discuss it and talk at each one of you pastors and evangelist and whatever you are and then if some great problem comes up you can't settle then if I'm called on the field of evangelism I don't know that it will be if I will be you know I'll be coming back constantly all the time and then if you get those things then when I come back here well we'll meet together and just sit down there one of you has a calling in your life we won't have like private interviews and things we've been having we'll just come right together and stay there till we have thus sayeth the Lord and if you can get the preacher straight and him going right look what he's going to do he's going to influence it would take care of the hundreds of these things that it were just beating at you see you got to get it a system God system like uh Jethro said to Moses why you can't beat out all of them or and God put Elders out there 70 of them and took the spirit was on Moses and put them up on those 70 elders and they prophesied and it didn't weaken Moses a bit and strengthen him he had just as much prophecy in him as he did before they took the spirit off of him that prophesy see he just separated sign of Moses let them judge the smaller things and but when it comes to the major things you come in with them and help him like that that's the way that was God's way back there that was God's way in the in the early church age and I believe it's God's way now that's right for us to do it so let's do it just quit talking about it and do it that's all we can do it by the grace of God don't you believe it now let's see all done tuck my time up but um Billy wrote a note here just a minute I'll see what it is I'm from New omne Daughter of Grace Memorial Hospital broke her arm uh uh wants to prayer for her t r o u b WC tro trobe something like that let's have prayer for this young lady our heavenly father as we're speaking now and I'm thinking it maybe when irenius looked out upon his little group of man it perhaps is a lot smaller group than she here tonight and they didn't have a seat to sit in they set on Old cold slabs of rock and they sat there and he talk to them those men went out even when to go they know they could be f head to lines or heads chopped off but the Faith of Our Fathers are living still in St SP of dungeon flame and sword I thank you for these men Lord I pray that you'll bless them and I bless each of them in thy name that you will keep them in the faith that was once delivered to the saints that never will they vary from that and out of this group may you send pastors teachers evangelists oh God grant it and may they hold the fort everywhere wherever they are may they continually work until Jesus comes and now father I pray for each of these requests that's coming here tonight and ask that you'll remember this little lady down here that just broke her arm may the power of almighty God heal her and make her well Grant it Lord I pray that you'll help her and bless bless her bless her loved ones for calling and may the power that raised up Jesus out of the Grave raise up this girl may her arm get well all these requests that was made mention tonight that poor boy laying there it's got this I heard the brother announce it that uh the Hodes disease has eat through him until his face is burn up with radium and things are given him God be merciful to that boy let him live we think of that man that didn't prepared to mean's gone on now his wife with a crushed head adopted child all these others sister Bruce packing that water she's getting old father and there she burn her arms and up and down her body we pray for her she's probably hospitalized and we pray that you'll deliver her and bring her out granted father we ask these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ amen now I want to ask you something and um ask you if um if you believe that we have time just for a little bit of the word do you have it just for it's I know it's a little late but I had a little something here that I thought out today that I would like to to speak on just for a minute and it might help you and I thought first that I would announce this now it's on this tape and if anybody would ever want to to refer to it Jim have see to what I think ought to be done and now what should be done to the for you Brethren now do you know when those early men went out sometimes they were only about six or eight of them together and they shook the country well do you know when Aquilla and perscilla that great Revival that Apollos was having over there there's only about six or eight men and women in that b much that whole church meant six or eight you got five or six seven times as many here tonight as they had Dan you know Jesus only had 12 Apostles we always think it for something big but God don't deal in them big numbers it's in these little groups is where he gets us in look all down through the age at any time he ever met with man it was in small groups see and spoke with him and ordained him it's God's good pleasure to do that that's way he likes to do it and now we just want to keep God in our midst and go do these things now Sunday morning Lord willing I want to speak to you on evening time evangelism and then I if the Lord permits I'll probably be leaving until late this fall and uh before I get back again I'll probably get back sometime in around in September and now I'm hoping but then that everything will move wonderfully for you Brethren and your meetings will grow in numbers and the grace of God be upon you all and until we meet and I'm trusting that you will pray for me and the success remember if your prayers for me that means you're my colleague you're you're my buddy my helper and together we are helpers in the Lord And now when I'm standing out there before the enemy I I want to remember that faithful true soldiers that gets prayer answered for the sick and The Afflicted and those men are praying for me I'm the one who needs it out there I'm really need it so you all pray for me when you GA don't forget me in any meeting pray for me now in St John the 9th chapter I want to read from the 26th verse until the 35th now just for a few minutes and then we'll we'll close in the next 20 or 30 minutes or maybe before that time the Lord willing now I want to read these scriptures now from St John 26 to uh St John 10 9 uh 26-35 I've got roll down here just something I thinking up then said they unto him again what did he do to thee how opened he thine eyes and he answered them I have told you already and you did not hear wherefore would you hear again will you also be his disciples then they reviled him and said died his disciples but we are moses' disciples we know that God spake unto Moses but for this fell we know not from whence he is the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvelous thing that you know not from whence he is and yet he has opened mine eyes now we know that God heareth not Sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth His will him he heareth since the world began has it not heard that any man has opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of God he could do nothing then answered they answered and said unto him thou was allog together born in sin and does thou teach us and they cast him out and Jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him does thou believe on the Son of God now I'd like to speak just for a few minutes to you Brethren knowing at my little talk here I don't know what will become of it trusting that God will use it in some way and now in this upon his word so I know that brother Saint brother Neville or one of you ministers usually preach and just being here with you uh if you'll pardon me I just i' like to speak to you a little bit on this man now I want to take a subject here of taking sides with Jesus the Pharisees and leaders of his Day always tried to belittle him before the people that was just a way that the devil had a working all the Pharisees and the teachers of his day constantly tried to belittle Jesus they all the throw off that they could give to him they done it they watched him constantly to find where they could find a fault and they never spoke of his good things they were always finding something that they could belittle him about and say you see look here if he was a man of God he wouldn't do it this way or if he was a man of God he wouldn't do it that way they were trying to cast The Shadow upon him to get the people to disbelieving am that's the work of the devil and that old scheme has never ceased there's many times that a minister will make a mistake and if he comes into a neighborhood a precious brother who's trying to do what's right e and that old scheme has never ceased amen and and that old scheme has never ceased am there's many times that a minister will make a m State and if he comes into a neighborhood a precious brother who's trying to do what's right and to lead the people right everything that the devil can point to the unbeliever or the so-called Christian in that neighborhood to throw off on that man he'll do it you know the real Christian way is to hide everything you can from a brother don't tell his bad things just tell his good things just tell what you know about him's good if anything's dad let it alone poor Fell's got enough against him anyhow don't try to take a pole and shove a man further into the ditch the Christian attitude is pick him up and take him out of the ditch they don't never try to shove him down he's down already try to help him up and but too many of us today too many people today I might say try to do that if they could just get something and other that they could say that was real bad now for instance if if one of you Brethren make a mistake and do something's wrong which you're subject to do it I am too every one of us but as we go along let's remember we are brothers we are brothers and if we got any fighting let's fight with one another bring it together bring it before our Brethren and settle it now they used to in the Brandon family if one of the little ones done something he go tell Bill about it cuz I was the biggest and I had stand there and see which is right and wrong well my decision was that uh if they uh which one is right and wrong if they still didn't believe it then they got around behind my back and fought it out but they were still Brothers you see they fight in the backyard with one another and fight in the front yard far one another so that's the way it was see and it we still Brothers well that that's the way we we got to do this see and if you got something against somebody you're a brother don't tell somebody else about if it's wrong go to him and tell him and then if he's going to argue with you then take somebody else with you then bring it up the way the Bible said but Jesus they they just tried to find every little shadow that they could find to try to belittle him in the sight of the people and that's what the devil wants they want to they want to hurt your influence before the people amen that's where you want to watch careful what you do walk like real man of God talk like man of God see act like man of God live like man of God because a devil your adversary is going about like a roaring lion trying to devour what he can why did they do this they were jealous of him amen that was what's the reason they tried to believe him they were jealous of his ministry amen and that's the reason they were trying to belittle he had the ministry history of God and they knew that but it was contrary to their Creed so they were trying to belittle him make everything every little flaw that they could find get him out of the way they want him to quit they wanted the people to denounce him they wanted to say now uh this guy's nothing look here now there he is he he he did this and you know that's not right we've been taught all of our life that we should believe the elders and Y he is stood right there and ball that Elder out he disagreed with the tradition of the father and we've been we are to believe the tradition of our fathers we've been taught that by each Rabbi all the years through and here this man comes around and disagrees with them see well the man like that ain't fit to be a preacher see they were trying to belittling but in all of that the ones that believed him and loved him and had seen his scriptural Miracle signs would not be hindered by them no sir them who believed him believed him amen those who loved him stood by him they would not see what others pointed out to them oh if we could do that if we could just not see if somebody turn on here say you know what they say you're a Pentecostal not by denomination what you was the you you the kind of baptizes in Jesus name yep that's right well let me tell you something I Know a Man one time was baptized like that and he did so and so but look that has nothing to do with it it's a devil trying to throw a shadow on you they're always trying to point you to some old ship that got wrecked upon the seashore but they're not pointing to that one that made the void safely that's right that's right they're always trying to throw a crowbait out there and say this is example here's what did it uh I know a certain preacher that was a Holiness preacher and he did this that the other but they don't point out others that wasn't Holiness did that also you see and they don't point the great things that God did like somebody say oh here this man went too far he he went too far he might have done that he wrecked himself up he went too far he become a fanatic he might have done that but while they're pointing to how many that went one that went too far how about these millions that never went far enough Fable to see that see what I mean so the people tried them Pharisees and S seses and hypocrites and herodians and all tried to cast The Shadow on Jesus but them True Believers that was predestinated to hear that message heard it and SE no fault in it at all same now those who believe him love him those who believe him see no fault in him they don't see any heresy they don't see anything wrong they don't see anything wrong with his word they don't see anything wrong with his people they just see Jesus and that's all they're they're they're predestinate eternal life so they just take sides with Jesus and stay there we used to write sing a little song brother Roy uh Ro we used to sing a little song here I guess time you come here I take the way with the Lord's dispise few I started in with Jesus and I'm going through I'd rather walk with Jesus alone and have for my pillow like Jacob a stone [Music]
