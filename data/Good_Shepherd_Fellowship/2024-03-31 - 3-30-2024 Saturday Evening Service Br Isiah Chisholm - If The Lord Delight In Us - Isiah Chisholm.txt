burn with us as he spoke to us along the way Lord Jesus will you speak to us tonight in Jesus name amen amen you have your Bibles amen praise the Lord amen happy to be here tonight amen if you will we just turning our Bibles to numbers the 14th chapter and we'll read from verse 1 to 8 then we'll go to Psalms 37 amen you have numbers the 14th chapter by saying amen and it reads and all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel mumbled against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them were that God we had died in the land of Egypt or would that God we had died in this Wilderness and wherefore has the Lord brought us unto this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be prayer were it not better for us to return unto Egypt they said one to another let us make us a captain and let us return unto Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and and Caleb the son of Jean which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceedingly good land if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us and the land which flowing with milk and honey now let's turn to Psalms 37 and verse three David writes here he said trust in the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell in the land and verily thou shall be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thy heart commit thy ways unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass let us bow our heads again father God we thank you Lord Jesus for the reading of your word now sanctify it to our hearts and our soul this we ask in Jesus name amen you may gladly take your seat praise the Lord amen just want to speak tonight amen from a little thought amen the Bible said Joshua said if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us unto this land in other words is God is pleased with us then he will bring us unto this land amen and we find that David said David uh Records uh delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart you know I don't know what our desire tonight but I know one thing that God's word doesn't change he the same yesterday today and forever amen delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart you know I was just I was talking uh uh to my wife just the other day you know after we saw the tragedy of what happened in in Baltimore where uh that that dock ran into the that pillow and caused all that tragedy and lives been lost and and they said that it could have been prevented but what caused that and as they begin to investigate what caused uh that to happen that bridge was standing for many years but all of a sudden something went wrong so I I told my wife I said you think about the children of Israel they was down in Egypt and how the prophet of God said that Egypt was a type of the world or an organization can you say Amen Egypt was a type of the world or an organization and we saw how that the children of Israel amen how they was in bondage for so many years amen and and and God here The Cry of the children of Israel and God raised up a man by the name uh of Moses a Shepherd uh kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law and and God sent Moses down to Egypt Amen to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt they was under the Taskmaster of uh Pharaoh the king of Egypt and you think about uh what they had to do down in Egypt eyp and I want to thank I want to tell you saints of God you know you said brother children now you you talk about down in Egypt you know we're the Bride of Jesus Christ I I glad you feel that way you know a lot of you may say well brother Chism we're not in Egypt I'm glad you know that amen but I just want to remind you uh of something that Apostle Paul said here in First Corinthian as it come to my mind in First Corinthian the 10th chapter in verse one it says more over Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our father were under the cloud and all passed through uh the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our example to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted let's look at verse 10 what it it says neither mumber ye as some of them also M and and very destroyed by of the Destroyer now all these things happen unto them for an example as they are written for our ammonition upon whom the end of the world are come wherefore let him thanth that thanth he standeth take heed lest he fall you know I I think brother and sister the children of Israel were down in the Egypt crying for delivered and God raised up Moses amen a Vindicated Prophet with thus said the Lord signs and W going down into Egypt bringing them out of Egypt bringing them from out of under the bond AG of pharaoh but you know brother and sister as they were down in Egypt am man they was rejoicing they was happy to know that God sent them a deliverer amen and and Moses as Moses uh begin to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt man I can imagine how rejoicing in they they were can you say amen amen amen and as the children of Israel journeyed also now as they went they was giving an angel to guide them or to bring them to a place that God had promised that angel was sent by there not that angel was seen by their natural eyes which was a pillar of fire that LED them through the Wilderness and and and give us the same Pillar of Fire how many you glad to know that which is nothing else but the word what was that pillow fire what was that angel any scholar here any of these Brethren of the learning mens out there know that that angel of the Covenant was Christ himself sh it wasu my God God Amen brought them out amen God by a Vindicated Prophet but you know brothers and sister I'm I'm thinking about as they came out you know something that they never seen before here here's the pill Fire by night and the cloud by day that was leading them amen out of Egypt was taking them into the Promised Land amen and they was rejoicing but let me tell you Church how they all amen escaped out of Egypt because they had the blood uh on the door por and the lent of the door amen and the de Angel was to come through and God requirement says when I see the blood God didn't said if I see a an animal or if I see that lamb but if I see that blood how many thank God the blood is on our heart tonight amen he said when I see the blood I will pass over you amen and you see how the children of Israel how they when they came out amen you know and and and uh coming out of Egypt and the prophet of God said they had no idea what was ahead of them can I just read what the prophet said Hallelujah when Israel left Egypt for the promised land and Exodus 13 and 21 God knowing that they had never traveled that way before it was the only 40 miles but yet they needed something to go with them they lost their way so he God sent them a god Exodus 13:21 something like this I'll send my angel before you the pill of fire to keep you in the way to guide them to the promised land and the children of Israel follow that God that Pillar of Fire night Cloud by day when it stop they stop when it Journey they journey and when it got them close to the land and they wasn't fit to go over he led them back into the wilderness my my let's investigate a little bit as I look at I mean if you see a Vindicated Prophet with thus said the Lord and they saw the the Red Sea open something that they' had never seen before the Red Sea open all the uh the the the Israelite crossed over and then they saw that Prophet Moses standing there with the Egyptian Army in behind them and they knowing not what to do had no idea they thought they was going to die you know it's an Egyptian Army would get them then they would drag them back they would kill them and they begin to fear but God Amen Moses begin to begin to cry and and Moses begin to cry and the prophet of God said God be to tell Moses why cry speak amen and and I believe the same thing today Church of the Living God sometime I found we we get to a situation we we get to a crossroad and we don't know what to do but I'm going to tell you brothers and sister it's no time to cry it's time to Amen to speak amen amen and we can cross over amen speak to it amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I I think about the children of Israel had no idea they had three stages of their Journey they they had to leave Egypt was the first stage they had to go through the Wilderness Amen in Cades barer amen the second stage and to get to the promised Landen now some believe uh that the promised land was a type uh of the Millennia brother Brandon said no it couldn't be because any millennium they rested but when they the children of Israel got into the promised land they were still Wars there were still battles they were still death and the brother and sister how many you know we are in that Promised Land amen we still having battle we still having trials amen amen but I thank God he brought us out and I thank God he sent an angel in this last day to lead us amen all the way amen but I think tonight Church of the Living God I said now what caused the children of Israel to mum and complain what caused the people to get relaxed what caused them to start missing church and start just staying home just start losing their desire what caused that what what what took the the the the prayer away what what caused the people to get discouraged what caused them to cry what caused them to get to a place where they say they don't need uh Moses anymore what what caused that church what caused them to say that Moses was false what caused the children of Israel to get to a place that say let us build us a golden calf and we would say that what brought us out of Egypt and brother sister I believe amen what has caused the children of Israel now if you notice in Exodus the 13th chapter how that Moses by the Commandment of God God told Moses to pick 12 men from each tribe and there to go un the promised land to see what it's all about brother brand preach a message what is the Holy Ghost and what is the Holy Ghost giving for brother Brandon said you need to know what it is and what is the result when you have it how do you know you have it a lot of people think that they have it and brother Brandon said the devil can't deceive a person and they're thinking that they have it and really they don't have it oh my my oh my so that's why in this hour we need to have an absolute can somebody say Amen we know that the prophet of God preach a message an absolute an absolute is perfect within itself and is Unlimited in its power it is an ultimate amen so that's what we need in this hour is an absolute well Moses Moses brother Brandon said God told Moses to piak those 12 can you imagine Moses Peak 12 out of each tribe and they will go down to Egypt and they were to bring back uh words and and and and they want to bring back now brothers and sister I want you to realize that Joshua and Caleb or none of the other 10 never saw the promised land they didn't have a clue what the promised land look like but Moses by Vision saw the promised land and he told them that the land was floting with milk and honey oh brother and sister amen we had a a a Apostle Paul begin to tell us uh um amen about heaven but we had a prophet in this age he told us what it was like on the other side amen so the children of Israel that Joshua and Caleb never seen the promised land but by faith they fought every inch of the way and when they got there Church of the Living God they saw the land they saw the promise let me tell you what church I don't know about you but I'm feasted with the King amen I'm happy in the Lord amen because God has brought us amen we've been led by Angel amen and this Angel is ordained to see us all the way through oh Church of the Living God I'm not going to turn to the right I'm not going to turn to the left but I'm going to keep my eyes on the revealed word of the hour can somebody say Amen the children of Israel amen the the the 12 went over there amen and they saw the grapes and also they saw the Giants but Joshua and Kayla you know sometime we we allow cirumstances to get in our way I've learned one thing our prophet of God says he said there's nothing that can happen to a Christian that God has an intent yes amen so brother Browner said I preach what Paul preached now brother Browner Paul said in Romans 8 that all things oh my brothers and sisters sometime amen without a revelation that scripture is so baffing sometime you mean to say Brothers children all things all things can I hear the whole church say all things I don't care if I'm down in the valley is going to do good for me hallelujah thank you Lord I've got to a place I've learned to rest in the arm of Jehovah I've learned to rest in the arm of elsh he the breathed one amen I don't care what I go through I've learned to say it's going to work out for my good amen why because I'm feasting amen I know who I am so all things work together for the good but sometime you find people that get discouraged in an hour and and and and the 10 the 12 gos over there and Joshua and Kayla they saw the problems they saw the Giants but they knew they had a promise amen they they knew that they was more than able to take that land how many you believe that amen how many you believe every promise in the book is yours amen so if you delight yourself in the Lord the Bible say he will give you the desires of your heart I say that to say this as it come to my mind just last week There's a pastor back in North Carolina he just took the church uh amen it's been about five years now he he has a a a a a platform he wanted steps to go all the way around it's always been his heart desires always been his heart desire amen and and all of a sudden they needed some the carpet with the the they was coming to put the carpet down but they had no one at at the last minute to to to build the step so him and his wife laid in the bed and said who can we get to do that they said we can't thank of nobody and all of a sudden he said they thought a brother chose them so what I'm trying to say God allow me cuz I I thought I was supposed to be at another place working but this brother said I don't need you tomorrow but see God already knew that that brother heart desire that brother wanted some steps he waited 5 years but if he Delight himself in the Lord God will give you your portion amen it may not come when you want it but you just be faithful amen amen whatever you got to do be faithful and God is obligated to meet your need Church we're living in a time God sees his people God would tou you for 5 years that brother wanted stepped all the way around thank you Lord but at the appointed time he laid in his bed he was frustrated he told his wife she said well honey do such and such he said I'm not going to do it now he was in the military he's brother children I put on my military cap I put on my bag and I told my wife I'm not going to do it but something about that wife she kept nagging him amen she kept saying honey we got to get this done but let me tell you what God must have sent an angel and told that Pastor called brother Chism Hallelujah and I was delighted to go down there and God gave that brother oh my if God could give that brother waited for five years that's why Isaiah said they that wait upon the Lord and that's what it said the Bible say hast thou not known H has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the end of the Earth faint is not how many you glad he neither is he weary there's no searching of of his understanding he give power to the might and to them that have no might he increas his strength even the young man shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength amen they shall what M up wings like an ox are you hearing me they shall M up wings as a lion they shall M up wings as an eagle my my and what that mean we are M up wings as an eager we'll fly above every trial every circumstance in amen I don't care what evil report we hear we will M up with wings as an eager somebody say Amen but you learn to trust in the Lord hallelujah amen now God gave brother Paul a just a a Pulpit wood put together now what about your heart if you ask for bread would he give you a strong but see God tested that Pastor for five five long years sometime you saying you want to rush God say you lord it's been long enough no that's not God's time I don't know about you brother and sister but I want God's time and that's why Solomon said everything there's a time and a season for all things that's why you need to wait on the Lord and when God sent you amen what's backing you up you got whole Heaven is backing you up amen but let me tell you Brothers sister when they went to the promised land they saw the grapes yeah they saw the big juicy clusters of GRA and Joshua and cayb said Joshua looked at Cayla and said brother we made it to the promised land let's go and get it did it saw the Giants did it saw the problems it was there did it saw the high blood pressure it was there then it saw the Mind battles it was there that it saw the problems in the marriage it was there but God made a promise they W looking at the problems they was looking at the promise those Brothers got that clusters of great praise God Amen and I can see the bible let us know it took two to car it was so big but brother Steve the other 10 saw the same [Music] thing but they came back with an evil report they came back y'all stay with me a moment they came back with the evil report you know what they told them we are already in the Rapture then they then it lost we in the rapt why we we already in the Millennium I was preaching at a church that preached when a mighty Angel descended that that brought so if Christ come that put us in the Millennium so he had the people they thought there was in the Millennium I said if Christ physical come then that put us in the millennium are you hearing me don't get quiet on me now I believe he's still amen when Christ descend I want to say that when when Christ descended he came down veil in a prophet are you hearing me amen but as I speak he's sitting on his throne as a memorial to this day are you hearing me oh y'all going to pull me to something but let let me let me back off of that hallelujah amen but it got the people discouraged amen because they thought they was in the Rapture or H H then they got discouraged over a period of time you know they they came back with a report and it says oh my my wh yes the land is Flowing with milk and honey but we we we can't take the land and the Bible says such an evil report that night it caused the children of Israel to cry out to God they brought back a report if yall don't mind me look can I just preach they brought back an evil report some said uh uh uh uh some came back with a tap Ministry are you hearing me y'all stay with me right some came back with a tap Ministry some come back with a return Ministry got the people so discouraged until people don't know what to do but look I know what to do somebody say Amen you may walk away but that's not going to change my mind about where I'm going I'm going look Church the reason why I can keep going I don't know about you but I could feel I could hear my diony is calling me I'm not just making words look I don't care if the church th out I got one motivation I got a theophany that's over there and it's calling me Mama are you hearing me and it's pulling me and it's going to cause me to get a body change Hallelujah good 4 years ago the church split someone called me uh brother called me I just got back from South Africa a minister called me said brother Chum I heard about the church split so what are you going to do I'm like what am going to do he said sent your church split what are you going to do I said brother I'm going to keep on what I've always done see if if if a man could bring you to it a man can take you away from it but let me tell you I've been led by that life that pfy no other than the Lord Jesus Christ can somebody say amen and that's why Joshua and Kayla Joshua and Kayla how many of you man Joshua and Kayla they came back you know why those Brothers spoke positive because they had another Spirit oh my that's why I thank God for the new birth in this hour God has given us another spirit and we are more than able to take this land amen hallelujah oh praise God Amen if if delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart delight yourself in the Lord I remember when we first moved up to North Carolina or before we move I I I wanted to move y'all don't mind me telling this a little testimony maybe it's going to help somebody I don't believe nothing out of cater I'm just following the Lord Brother St I remember we wanted to move to North Carolina and when we tried to move things didn't work right and see when God got his hand in it the devil might fight but God will make it come to pass so that year we we we couldn't move but at the appointed time when it was time God had the funds there God had everything but this what happened brother and sisters I don't know if I told you all this I went up to my f and I we flew out to New York and uh when we went out to New York uh I minister at a church and the the Lord moved in such a mighty way until the pastor uh he says up under the anointing he said whatsoever you have on your heart he said write it down y'all hearing me write it down now you said well oh I don't know about all that well brother Brown said one time brother brownon said write it down and put it in the book of Acts acts the 19th Chapter are you hearing me are you hearing me see a lot of people don't believe that but I believe just what he said I'm just crazy enough to believe that amen are you hearing me I believe amen I remember I'm going to try to go back to that y'all pulling me but I remember I had a condition need to be taken care of Amen at the time I was out of work and I had a bill that was coming brother Steve and it was in possible to pay but I found what the prophet of God said write it down put it in the book of Acts now in my pun mind I may think what the book of Acts got to do with a promise in the book of Acts they talking about Paul and apollis was at Corinth so if I reason with that I ain't going to get nothing are you hearing me but because a Vindicated Prophet said put it in there and you know what I did church at the Living God I put it in Acts the 19th Chapter I closed the book and I went to bed I Delight myself in the Lord and I went to bed that night and you know what that Old Devil told me say you mean to tell me you believe God going to meet your need by you putting something in there amen but see I didn't did like Eve I didn't talk back to the devil you know what I did I just turn over and I just rest in the arm of Jehovah I didn't reason with that devil this bride in this day they they become the ver voice in this hour so I didn't reason I went to sleep on that devil that's what some of us need to do is go to sleep on that devil I turned over yes and the next day I got up and doing my choice and I know devil he won't quit he said the ey the clock is tining and you're going to make a food out of yourself it ain't going to come to pass you think I listen to that devil no I trust in
