[1:04:17] as we go into the word.
[1:04:28] If you have your Bible with you, turn
[1:04:30] with me to the book of Isaiah.
[1:04:37] Isaiah chapter 55
[1:04:52] verse 8.
[1:04:54] And then we also turn to John chapter 5.
[1:04:58] vers 39
[1:05:02] Isaiah 55. Let us pray.
[1:05:05] Our dear Lord, you are the author of
[1:05:07] your word and we pray that the spirit
[1:05:10] that wrote the word will come this
[1:05:11] morning
[1:05:13] and just anoint this word in our lips,
[1:05:15] in our ears as we speak and hear it in
[1:05:18] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Verse 8
[1:05:23] says, "For my thoughts
[1:05:27] are not your thoughts,
[1:05:31] neither are your ways my ways, said the
[1:05:34] Lord.
[1:05:36] For as the heavens are higher than the
[1:05:39] earth, so my ways higher than your ways,
[1:05:43] and my thoughts than your thoughts."
[1:05:47] Amen.
[1:05:49] to John 5
[1:05:51] verse 39.
[1:05:56] John 5:39
[1:06:00] says, "Such the scriptures,
[1:06:03] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:06:05] life,
[1:06:07] and they are they testify of me." May
[1:06:11] God add blessings to the reading of his
[1:06:13] word. Let us please be seated.
[1:06:16] By
[1:06:20] the grace of God, I just want to fe talk
[1:06:24] on
[1:06:26] the thoughts of God.
[1:06:28] The thoughts of God, the eternal
[1:06:30] thoughts of God. Amen. And uh when we
[1:06:35] look at them, we to go into some quotes
[1:06:37] and some scriptures. And uh from the
[1:06:40] scripture we have just read, it is very
[1:06:43] clear
[1:06:45] that
[1:06:48] The thoughts of God are different from
[1:06:49] the human thoughts.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; They are far.
[1:06:54] Yes, God clearly said it. Your thoughts
[1:06:57] are not my thoughts.
[1:07:00] Your ways are not my ways. So you can
[1:07:04] see there is a very big disparity
[1:07:06] between God's thought, the human
[1:07:08] thoughts and the thoughts of God.
[1:07:10] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes. So um This
[1:07:16] morning I'm talking about the eternal
[1:07:17] thoughts of God.
[1:07:19] Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh if you go back to
[1:07:24] Jeremiah, Jeremiah 29 says, "For I for I
[1:07:28] know the thoughts that I think toward
[1:07:30] you."
[1:07:31] These are God's thoughts to his
[1:07:33] children, say the Lord. Say they are
[1:07:36] thoughts of peace,
[1:07:39] not of evil,
[1:07:41] and to give you an expected end. These
[1:07:45] are the thoughts of God,
[1:07:48] you know. So, um, you see, and thoughts
[1:07:52] are very important. In the book of Psalm
[1:07:54] 92:5,
[1:07:56] David said, "Oh Lord, how great are thy
[1:07:59] works and thy thoughts are very deep."
[1:08:01] So, the thoughts of God are deep.
[1:08:04] Hallelujah.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; They are good. They are not thoughts of
[1:08:07] evil.
[1:08:08] He say how precious in 139:17 he say how
[1:08:11] precious also are the thoughts I thy
[1:08:14] thoughts unto me oh God how great is the
[1:08:17] sum of them. So we can see that the
[1:08:19] thoughts of God are great.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thoughts of God are
[1:08:23] deep.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; They are thoughts of peace. Hallelujah.
[1:08:27] These are the thoughts God has for his
[1:08:29] children. Hallelujah.
[1:08:32] And you can see that man's thoughts is
[1:08:35] far different from God's thoughts.
[1:08:37] Hallelujah. Amen. Man's thoughts, the
[1:08:41] Bible say they are vanity.
[1:08:45] Hallelujah. They are perishable.
[1:08:49] They will pass away.
[1:08:52] They will fail.
[1:08:54] Hallelujah.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Psalm 94:11, the Lord knows the
[1:09:00] thoughts of man that they are vanity.
[1:09:03] Hallelujah.
[1:09:05] Vanity.
[1:09:06] So they he said they are vanity. And uh
[1:09:11] in verse in Psalm 146:3-4
[1:09:16] he said put you not your trust in
[1:09:18] princes nor in the son of man in whom
[1:09:22] there is no light.
[1:09:24] He breathe when his breath go forth. He
[1:09:28] returns to his earth. In that very day
[1:09:31] his thoughts perish.
[1:09:35] That very day that man dies. Everything
[1:09:36] perishes.
[1:09:39] So you can see the difference between
[1:09:41] God's thoughts and the human thoughts.
[1:09:44] Our thoughts are perishable.
[1:09:47] They will fail. They are shallow. They
[1:09:50] are not deep. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:09:55] But the God's thoughts they are. I was
[1:09:58] looking at the dictionary and the
[1:10:00] dictionary said an opinion produced by
[1:10:02] thinking. That is thoughts. That is the
[1:10:04] human thoughts. Is an opinion produced
[1:10:06] by thinking. These are thoughts. Amen.
[1:10:10] Hallelujah. That's what the dictionary
[1:10:12] says. Yes. But when we go into the
[1:10:14] message, Hallelujah.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you go to the Smanian church
[1:10:18] age, we see why the prophet of God says
[1:10:21] hallelujah. He said the thoughts of God,
[1:10:23] they are eternal and they are real.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; You can see the quality of the thoughts
[1:10:29] of God.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; How eternal, how real they are.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; So clearly that is his thoughts are
[1:10:35] different from our thoughts. Amen. So
[1:10:38] you see the way we think then it
[1:10:40] behooves us to make sure that our
[1:10:42] thoughts are in line with God's thought.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Being human. Hallelujah. We have
[1:10:47] our own human thinking, our human
[1:10:49] reasonings, the way we think if we don't
[1:10:53] have God's thoughts. And let's see what
[1:10:55] about thoughts of God here in the smian
[1:10:58] church age. He said be careful here and
[1:11:01] see this. It is not the person that
[1:11:03] comes predestinated eternally from God.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; It's not individual. Hallelujah. You
[1:11:09] see, it is the word.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. or seed.
[1:11:16] That is it. It's a way back there back
[1:11:19] from the human mind to crafts. The
[1:11:22] eternal God with eternal thoughts.
[1:11:27] Hallelujah. The eternal God with eternal
[1:11:30] thoughts. And we know when we talk about
[1:11:33] eternal something that never had a
[1:11:35] beginning
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; and it does not end.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; That eternal quality
[1:11:44] Hallelujah. Amen. So here we see Amen. A
[1:11:48] seed of God has a child of God has a
[1:11:51] seed of God placed in him or Hallelujah.
[1:11:54] predestinated.
[1:11:56] And it is that quality that eternal
[1:11:58] quality that is predestinated.
[1:12:00] Hallelujah. Amen. By God. It's not the
[1:12:03] individual.
[1:12:05] It is not the answer. It's not me. You
[1:12:06] see the physical. It is that seed that
[1:12:09] is very paramount to God. That is very
[1:12:11] important to God. Hallelujah. Amen. That
[1:12:14] is the internal component of God that
[1:12:16] God himself cannot lose.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Because it has an eternal component and
[1:12:24] he goes it can it cannot be missing. It
[1:12:26] cannot lose. Jesus Christ said all that
[1:12:29] the father has given I lose none.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a stranger
[1:12:34] they would not follow. That is why you
[1:12:37] see Hallelujah. He look at Jacob. Amen.
[1:12:40] Hallelujah. Jacob in him was he was the
[1:12:43] thought of God. He has a thought of God
[1:12:44] in him. He had a seed of God in him. He
[1:12:46] was predestinated. So God was not
[1:12:48] looking at him outside. He was looking
[1:12:50] at the internal component. Hallelujah.
[1:12:52] Which is a part of God. Hallelujah. That
[1:12:54] he placed in him. Hallelujah.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; It has an eternal quality. Amen. And
[1:12:59] amen.
[1:13:02] Amen. And amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:05] Hallelujah. And then let us look at what
[1:13:08] actually a thought is. That is a thought
[1:13:10] according to the message we believe. We
[1:13:12] some
[1:13:14] thought
[1:13:16] words are thoughts expressed.
[1:13:20] Hallelujah.
[1:13:21] Amen.
[1:13:23] Amen.
[1:13:25] Words are thoughts expressed
[1:13:28] when you look at a word.
[1:13:30] So that presupposes that
[1:13:34] this
[1:13:42] this word and we also refer to it as the
[1:13:44] word.
[1:13:46] But the Bible says in the beginning was
[1:13:49] the word.
[1:13:53] In the beginning was the word. So the
[1:13:56] word had a beginning
[1:13:59] because a thought is eternal. It has
[1:14:01] internal component. It goes beyond the
[1:14:03] beginning.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:08] Amen. That is why our life has been
[1:14:11] there before the beginning.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Where were you when the sons of God
[1:14:18] shouted for joy
[1:14:21] before he laid the foundation?
[1:14:23] Hallelujah. Where were you?
[1:14:27] Amen. Your thoughts are the attributes
[1:14:30] of God. Hallelujah.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. In John chapter one, in the
[1:14:35] beginning was the word. So you can see
[1:14:38] the eternal component. Hallelujah. You
[1:14:41] see how real, how important the word of
[1:14:45] God is. That is why we don't compromise
[1:14:48] with the word.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:51] The word of God are the thoughts of God.
[1:14:54] They have that internal component.
[1:14:56] Hallelujah. Amen. So you see God don't
[1:15:00] play with the thoughts of his word.
[1:15:04] Hallelujah. He doesn't play with that.
[1:15:06] The devil also when he comes to us, he
[1:15:09] comes to us and attacks our thoughts
[1:15:11] because there is where the whole thing
[1:15:13] is. Is a battle is a war of thoughts. A
[1:15:16] war of words.
[1:15:19] Hallelujah. He placed thoughts. He came
[1:15:21] to Jesus. Hallelujah. So when we go back
[1:15:23] into the beginning, Eden, he uses words.
[1:15:27] Those words that were speaking to Mama
[1:15:29] Eve, he was producing thoughts.
[1:15:34] But these are cannal thoughts. These are
[1:15:36] wicked thoughts. These are perishable
[1:15:38] thoughts. These are thought that will
[1:15:39] fail. Hallelujah.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Against the eternal thoughts of God.
[1:15:47] Amen.
[1:15:49] Amen.
[1:15:50] Hallelujah.
[1:15:53] Amen.
[1:15:54] Yes. Hallelujah. But we see here in
[1:15:59] verse 14 of John chapter one, he said,
[1:16:02] "And the word became flesh." So Jesus
[1:16:04] Christ, that's why he died before the
[1:16:06] foundation of the world. In the thought,
[1:16:08] in the mind of God, the attribute of
[1:16:10] God,
[1:16:12] you were attribute of God in him before.
[1:16:15] That is why no circumstance, no
[1:16:17] situation, no condition will take a son
[1:16:20] and a daughter of God from the program
[1:16:22] of God
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; because you have the eternal component.
[1:16:25] And God values that. Hallelujah. God
[1:16:28] treasures that because that is God
[1:16:30] himself.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:33] Amen.
[1:16:35] Amen.
[1:16:37] If you go to the message, who is this
[1:16:38] mech?
[1:16:41] It is on here
[1:16:44] and preach that message
[1:16:47] paragraph 54
[1:16:50] that is after the
[1:16:53] here. He said he said you were there on
[1:16:56] his attributes.
[1:17:00] Amen. Said but you don't remember it
[1:17:04] truly being human we don't remember it.
[1:17:09] Hallelujah. Amen. Now say no because you
[1:17:14] are just a part of this life.
[1:17:19] You can in the mind of God before the
[1:17:21] foundation of the world. Nothing new is
[1:17:23] taking place now
[1:17:26] just a rehearsal. That is why we find it
[1:17:29] privilege and opportunity to be here.
[1:17:34] Sometimes not even by our making because
[1:17:37] God has proposed before the foundation
[1:17:39] of royalty. He said you don't remember
[1:17:41] it.
[1:17:43] No, because you are just a part of his
[1:17:45] life. You are a part of God when you
[1:17:47] became a son or a daughter of God.
[1:17:49] Hallelujah.
[1:17:52] 55 say notice now his attribute then the
[1:17:55] attribute was first God the thought
[1:18:01] the attribute itself all in one
[1:18:04] with being expressed he said secondly he
[1:18:07] became the word
[1:18:10] the word are thoughts expressed amen so
[1:18:15] oh wonderful the Bible say as a man
[1:18:16] thinkketh in his heart so is he
[1:18:20] so thinking, your thoughts are very
[1:18:22] important. Hallelujah.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] Your thoughts, the thought process is
[1:18:29] very key. That what makes you what you
[1:18:32] are. Hallelujah. You say here, you say
[1:18:36] here, you say here say he became the
[1:18:38] word. Then the word was made flesh and
[1:18:41] dwelt among us. Amen. In paragraph 57
[1:18:45] because of time his first being was
[1:18:48] spirit supernatural the great eternal
[1:18:52] say second he began to form himself
[1:18:55] towards flesh
[1:18:58] in e theopani
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; theophani we all know that is a word
[1:19:04] body
[1:19:07] amen it is called a word body he met
[1:19:11] Abraham in that
[1:19:14] Hallelujah. So we can see that even
[1:19:18] Jesus had a beginning. Hallelujah.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] Yes. Because he became flesh.
[1:19:27] Hallelujah. Yes. But he had the internal
[1:19:29] component that is the eternal aspect of
[1:19:31] God. And so when he became the word
[1:19:35] before he became the word, he came from
[1:19:37] that thought to theophony. Hallelujah.
[1:19:42] There's a process between the spoke the
[1:19:44] word the thoughts and the word becoming
[1:19:46] flesh and that period that's the period
[1:19:49] of the theophony that is why brother
[1:19:51] said that was the time that was in that
[1:19:53] body he met Abraham in what body
[1:19:56] that was the time he met Abraham he told
[1:19:58] him before Abraham was I am
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; your father Abraham rejoiced to see my
[1:20:06] day and he saw it and he was glad
[1:20:10] when he was in
[1:20:12] that body can appear and disappear.
[1:20:15] Hallelujah. Amen. So you can see here
[1:20:19] the format he came from thoughts to
[1:20:21] theophony and then he became the word.
[1:20:23] That is why in that word he knew all
[1:20:24] things.
[1:20:27] Amen.
[1:20:29] Amen. Yes sir.
[1:20:32] Now if you come down to further in that
[1:20:34] message said there is a difference
[1:20:36] between we and him Christ
[1:20:40] we we we bypass our theopaness
[1:20:45] and come to the flesh to be tried.
[1:20:50] That is what the prophet said.
[1:20:52] Hallelujah. If you go further because of
[1:20:54] time we bypass that theophony. So that's
[1:20:57] why we don't know all things.
[1:20:59] Hallelujah. Amen. Ouropan is somewhere
[1:21:03] we are going to that your
[1:21:08] body eternal in the heaven. The Bible
[1:21:10] say a body not made with hands. It is
[1:21:13] not this flesh body. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:17] Oh my. May the Lord help us. Hallelujah.
[1:21:20] Amen. Yes sir. So now we are going back
[1:21:24] to that word body. How can we go become
[1:21:26] to that word body that you find? It has
[1:21:28] to be by the word.
[1:21:30] So see how power the word. Hallelujah.
[1:21:34] And words are thoughts express. That is
[1:21:36] why we come here as preachers. We preach
[1:21:39] the word of God for you to become the
[1:21:41] thoughts of God. To have the thoughts of
[1:21:42] God, to become the word of God, an
[1:21:45] attribute of God. Remember, you don't
[1:21:47] remember that. Somebody is coming out to
[1:21:49] tell you the word of God is telling you
[1:21:50] this is what you are. This is where you
[1:21:53] came from. But because of the fall being
[1:21:56] human hallelujah it become very
[1:21:58] difficult for us to comprehend that
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; that is why it's very important for us
[1:22:05] to come to church
[1:22:08] the prophet said the day you receive
[1:22:09] this message that is the day you heard
[1:22:12] from your father
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen. something in you that
[1:22:20] God has placed the internal component.
[1:22:24] You cannot help, nobody can help. Your
[1:22:26] father cannot stop that. No brother,
[1:22:28] your neighbor cannot stop that because
[1:22:30] that is the internal component of God.
[1:22:32] It has to respond to the other aspect of
[1:22:34] God that is internal.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Some call it heresy.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; They call it names.
[1:22:46] Hallelujah. That is your representation.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:52] Amen. And amen. Amen.
[1:22:56] So,
[1:22:58] now
[1:23:00] now listen very carefully. I think
[1:23:03] because of time
[1:23:06] look you will never be the word unless
[1:23:09] you were a thought at the beginning.
[1:23:16] Amen. Hallelujah. Then you can see the
[1:23:19] sovereignty of God. You can see the mind
[1:23:22] of God. You will never become
[1:23:26] the word except your daughter
[1:23:29] at the beginning. Amen.
[1:23:33] There is nothing
[1:23:35] to be quickened in a non seed.
[1:23:40] A seed has life in it. Amen.
[1:23:46] has to be.
[1:23:48] Amen. And I read the message. I read the
[1:23:51] Bible. Sometimes I study. That is why
[1:23:53] you see when he came in the flesh, he
[1:23:55] made sure that he cut all of those who
[1:23:58] were predestinated.
[1:24:00] He said, "My sheep will hear my voice
[1:24:02] and the stranger. They will not follow
[1:24:05] all that the father has given me. I will
[1:24:07] lose none."
[1:24:11] Hallelujah.
[1:24:14] Amen. He had an experience with the
[1:24:16] Pharisees, the Sadducees.
[1:24:19] These are people who have who claim that
[1:24:21] they can see even by their name.
[1:24:33] The last part of the spelling they see
[1:24:35] but they are blind. Jesus looked at him
[1:24:36] and said you are blind.
[1:24:41] Amen. And so when he came to them they
[1:24:46] look at him they look at the word and
[1:24:48] they call the word bell.
[1:24:52] Why the seat there? There's no
[1:24:55] representation in them
[1:24:58] to see the world. And when let's see the
[1:25:00] encounter between him and the woman in
[1:25:02] John chapter 4.
[1:25:08] That woman was the predestinated seed of
[1:25:11] God placing her.
[1:25:13] She was a seed of Abraham. She was a
[1:25:16] daughter of Abraham. If you read the
[1:25:18] Bible, the Bible say she was a daughter
[1:25:20] of Abraham.
[1:25:22] Look at because of time I don't have
[1:25:24] time because time will not be on our
[1:25:26] side. I take my time to look at some of
[1:25:27] these things. When he went to Zakius the
[1:25:31] Bible say because even the woman with
[1:25:32] the blood because she was a daughter of
[1:25:34] Abraham. Read your Bible very carefully.
[1:25:36] Why? Why is it a seed of she had the
[1:25:38] seed of Abraham in? And then we look at
[1:25:42] this woman outwardly. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:25:45] man, I don't want to go into that but
[1:25:48] you know the story. You know the rest.
[1:25:49] Hallelujah.
[1:25:51] Amen.
[1:25:52] She has been moving from church to
[1:25:54] church, church to church, man to man,
[1:25:57] man to man. You know, yes, in that
[1:26:01] condition before the Pharisees,
[1:26:07] she's deserted. She's an outcast. She's
[1:26:10] not fit. But she had eternal life
[1:26:13] before.
[1:26:21] But it takes the word to identify the
[1:26:24] word.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] Amen.
[1:26:34] Amen. When children of God meet, there's
[1:26:37] a representation in them
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; that this is a child of God
[1:26:42] despite of our condition.
[1:26:45] Remember
[1:26:47] the word is a designer of the thoughts.
[1:26:50] She came before the word
[1:26:58] begin to release the word.
[1:27:01] As he was releasing the word, the word
[1:27:04] was treated going down to find that seed
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; because she had something to be
[1:27:11] quickened. Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; There is an attraction.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Remember he just came from the Pharisees
[1:27:18] and they told him he was the chief of
[1:27:21] the devils.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; But here is in now before hallelujah a
[1:27:26] predestinated seed of God. Hallelujah.
[1:27:29] And then he begin to release the word.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; He started with physical things, natural
[1:27:37] things. But he had a purpose.
[1:27:41] The purpose is to drive at that eternal
[1:27:44] component of God that is placing all.
[1:27:46] Hallelujah.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Give me physically give me water to
[1:27:53] drink.
[1:27:54] Say what?
[1:27:58] Don't you know that you are a Jew and
[1:28:00] I'm a Samaritan who have no dealings?
[1:28:03] Probably he might have looked at
[1:28:06] you know the way women can look at me.
[1:28:10] Oh, she had an she's very much
[1:28:12] interested
[1:28:23] and the word
[1:28:26] Jesus was looking at
[1:28:28] if you read the Bible say he had meat
[1:28:30] that he must pass through some
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; of you don't even know why God brought
[1:28:38] you here.
[1:28:40] from different countries, things that
[1:28:44] not just for these things that will
[1:28:45] perish. They will fail, they will pass
[1:28:46] away,
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; but there is an internal component that
[1:28:49] God is interested in
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; supernaturally.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He brought you here.
[1:28:58] Do you think you're here for the
[1:28:59] American dollars? That is something more
[1:29:02] than gold.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; It's because of that eternal component.
[1:29:05] Hallelujah.
[1:29:07] He has a table spread where the saints
[1:29:09] of God are fed. He placed his servant to
[1:29:12] come by way. Hallelujah. And then they
[1:29:16] started the conversation.
[1:29:20] You you know you are a Jew. I'm we have
[1:29:23] no
[1:29:25] you know when God wants to he doesn't
[1:29:27] want any human interaction interference.
[1:29:30] He made sure that disciples I knew if
[1:29:31] Peter was there it would have been a
[1:29:33] reference story.
[1:29:37] It would have been a different story.
[1:29:40] He said, "You know what? Go and buy
[1:29:41] bread. Go, you go to town."
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; When he's come to eternal life, he
[1:29:46] himself will come down.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; He come down.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; He doesn't entrust that to any human
[1:29:56] being. Hallelujah. No.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Because that is himself. Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; In Eden when man was lost, he came down.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; That is why he came down this evening
[1:30:10] time.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:18] the woman
[1:30:21] and the woman
[1:30:24] she was a church go
[1:30:26] because from the conversation you know
[1:30:28] that she's not just she's not a novice
[1:30:31] maybe something somewhere went somewhere
[1:30:33] wrong somewhere it's because of
[1:30:35] misinterpreted theology wrong teachings
[1:30:39] she found herself in that conditional
[1:30:43] Hallelujah.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Because sometime I don't want to lab
[1:30:49] this one. Hallelujah. But sometimes it's
[1:30:51] God. He said he said he said if you know
[1:30:54] who is talking to you
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; you ask me to give you life water that
[1:31:01] will not test no more.
[1:31:04] While this was going the word was
[1:31:06] penetrating.
[1:31:09] The the conversation is now moving from
[1:31:11] the physical to the spirit
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; to discover
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; the internal component.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; All the issue of water, drinking water
[1:31:25] is just a way meaning to discover the
[1:31:28] internal component.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Miracles, signs and wonders, they are
[1:31:33] nice. They are just the gospel.
[1:31:37] But there is a purpose.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. And the only thing that has that
[1:31:44] ability is the word.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; It's not a public show.
[1:31:52] Hallelujah.
[1:31:54] It is the word that you identify the
[1:31:56] word. And so
[1:31:59] he said he gave me he said he said sir I
[1:32:03] perceived
[1:32:05] this not the spirit it's not the stress
[1:32:08] of the spirit perceptual
[1:32:13] I perceive that you're not going to
[1:32:15] another realm from the physical the
[1:32:20] I perceive that prophet and they said
[1:32:22] when the messiah cometh he will do these
[1:32:29] Why?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:35] Let me come back to my God bless you.
[1:32:39] Amen. This is how I preach you.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. You don't expect me jumpy here
[1:32:47] and there. We take our time.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:53] Amen.
[1:32:55] Amen.
[1:32:57] So did we see he said see we did not
[1:33:00] come by sea.
[1:33:02] Yes. Back to the quote. Amen. Yes. Uh
[1:33:06] yes. Um yes. Church age. Yeah.
[1:33:13] Amen. Yes sir. Now the SM church age
[1:33:18] where you say how how we we are coming
[1:33:21] to a conclusion as the logos God was
[1:33:24] manifest in flesh and in Jesus dwelt all
[1:33:26] the fullness of the godhead bodily that
[1:33:28] eternal one was the father manifest in
[1:33:31] flesh
[1:33:33] and thereby gained the title of son even
[1:33:36] so eternal in his thoughts now manifest
[1:33:40] in flesh after sons
[1:33:43] sons of god even as We so called.
[1:33:47] We so called see we did not become seed
[1:33:49] by rebirth.
[1:33:51] We we were seed and therefore reborn for
[1:33:56] only the elect can be freeborn
[1:34:00] because we were seed in the re is the
[1:34:04] reason we could not we could be we could
[1:34:07] be quickened.
[1:34:09] Hallelujah. In non seed there is nothing
[1:34:12] to quicken. Amen.
[1:34:16] That's why Judas all he slept with the
[1:34:19] word. He walked with the word. He fish
[1:34:20] with the word. There's nothing him to
[1:34:22] quickly.
[1:34:24] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's look at Peter.
[1:34:28] Almost what Peter did, Jesus did, Judas
[1:34:31] did. But because Peter was a seed,
[1:34:36] he denied the Lord twice
[1:34:40] even c
[1:34:44] Judas was very active.
[1:34:46] He casted out demons. He was among the
[1:34:48] 82 guys that went to vis
[1:34:51] but his name was not there. It's not the
[1:34:53] seed of God. There's no way Jesus could
[1:34:56] lose him if he was a seed of God.
[1:34:59] He told Peter say Satan has desired you
[1:35:01] to swiftly as said but I have prayed for
[1:35:04] you.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Judas repented but his repentance was
[1:35:09] not accepted. He was not there. His name
[1:35:12] is in the book of he never had that
[1:35:14] eternal component.
[1:35:17] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So under no
[1:35:21] circumstance can a child of God be
[1:35:23] missing.
[1:35:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Because there was no
[1:35:29] seed. Hallelujah. See, see how he works.
[1:35:32] God always had his thoughts. Go further.
[1:35:35] His thoughts was yet unexpressed.
[1:35:37] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:35:42] Amen.
[1:35:43] Yes. So if you come here some will give
[1:35:47] you a little idea of this. My substance
[1:35:49] was not was not hid from thee when I was
[1:35:52] made in the in secret and curiously
[1:35:54] wrought in the lowest part of earth.
[1:35:56] Thine eyes did see my substance yet
[1:35:59] being on perfect. In thine book all my
[1:36:02] members were written, which in
[1:36:05] continuence was fashioned, when as yet
[1:36:08] there was none of them.
[1:36:11] Say Jeremiah, Moses, John the Baptist,
[1:36:14] each one of these are God's eternal
[1:36:15] thoughts.
[1:36:18] So if they are God, we are also God's
[1:36:20] eternal thoughts.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; You have to be thinking this way.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. Yeah,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; you have to accept it, my brothers and
[1:36:30] sisters. Hallelujah.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; These guys, they are God's eternal
[1:36:34] thoughts. These our precious brothers.
[1:36:37] So if they are God's eternal thoughts,
[1:36:39] we are also God's eternal thoughts.
[1:36:43] Amen.
[1:36:44] Anything that is not eternal will not go
[1:36:46] there. That is why the body will go with
[1:36:48] over there is a word body. It's an
[1:36:50] eternal. It's a word body. It's eternal.
[1:36:52] This flesh will perish.
[1:36:54] It will change.
[1:36:56] Hallelujah. It's flesh and blood. It's
[1:36:59] conceived in sin. Hallelujah. It's by
[1:37:01] emotions, by feelings
[1:37:04] we came into existence.
[1:37:06] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:37:11] Now he said then we come to Jesus to
[1:37:15] Jesus the logos. He was the perfect and
[1:37:18] complete thoughts
[1:37:20] expressed and he became known as the
[1:37:22] word.
[1:37:25] You see, I'm talking about eternal
[1:37:27] thoughts of God. Jesus was the perfect,
[1:37:30] the complete. He's not just a portion.
[1:37:33] You are a portion. I am a portion. But
[1:37:35] he was the entirety, the fullness of the
[1:37:37] word.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Yes. He became known
[1:37:44] as the word. That is what he is and
[1:37:46] forever will be.
[1:37:49] This how prophet speaking. Hallelujah.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see the scripture say he
[1:37:55] has chosen us in him before the
[1:37:58] foundation of the world. If you go down
[1:38:00] he said that is an eternal quality to
[1:38:03] the elect. You can't get away from that.
[1:38:07] Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So those who are not in God's
[1:38:17] thoughts, who are not the word of God,
[1:38:18] they're hoping to see the word of God.
[1:38:20] No way.
[1:38:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir.
[1:38:27] In John chapter 15:10, he said, "If you
[1:38:29] abide in me and my word in you," Amen.
[1:38:34] Ask whatsoever you desire,
[1:38:38] whatsoever, he will grant it to you. So
[1:38:41] you see, so when the word comes in us,
[1:38:46] Amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If the word comes, if the
[1:38:50] words abide, if you abide in me and my
[1:38:52] words abide in you,
[1:38:55] I will ask whatsoever
[1:39:00] you will. So see the importance of the
[1:39:02] word. The word is very important. That
[1:39:05] is why in this end time, God brought
[1:39:08] back the word
[1:39:10] because remember the fall came in by
[1:39:13] what? Disobedience to the word of God.
[1:39:16] So in this end time, God brought back
[1:39:18] the word.
[1:39:20] Hallelujah. To take us back to the
[1:39:23] thoughts of God. Remember, we've
[1:39:24] forgotten. Hallelujah. So when we come
[1:39:26] to church, we hear the word preaching.
[1:39:28] Hallelujah. It is taking you back. As
[1:39:31] you walk with God, you hear the word,
[1:39:33] you receive the word of God. Amen.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You walk towards your theophony.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; You are becoming the word. Hallelujah.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; And when you become the word,
[1:39:43] Hallelujah. Amen. When you speak, your
[1:39:46] thoughts are God's thoughts.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Your words. Hallelujah.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody is sick. You have the word of
[1:39:53] God. You I just lay my hands upon you.
[1:39:56] Hallelujah. You are healed in the name
[1:39:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; For the word is in me.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; It is not me. It's not about me. It's
[1:40:03] about the word of God.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; That is why God himself when Jesus
[1:40:07] Christ, he respects the word.
[1:40:09] Hallelujah. Yeah. And when we come in,
[1:40:11] we take God's thoughts, not human
[1:40:13] thoughts, human ideas. That's why we are
[1:40:16] Christians. We are called, we are not of
[1:40:17] the world. We are not in the world.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are what? We are the word made
[1:40:22] flesh today
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; in this hour that we are living in.
[1:40:25] Hallelujah. So we come to church to hear
[1:40:28] the word of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Now,
[1:40:31] identification 1964.
[1:40:35] I love this quote. Paragraph 88.
[1:40:38] It's good to project it so that we can
[1:40:40] see it. should not be my own words. It
[1:40:42] has to be the word of God. As I'm
[1:40:43] preaching, if you believe the word of
[1:40:45] God, whatsoever your problem is, your
[1:40:48] situation,
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; the word of God is going to sort it out
[1:40:52] for you.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all of my heart.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Identification
[1:41:03] 19
[1:41:05] Yes. 64
[1:41:07] February 16.
[1:41:10] I love a quote from that message.
[1:41:17] Yes sir. Brother say here in that
[1:41:19] message he said what he said the more
[1:41:21] the word molds the character
[1:41:26] in that paragraph it he said the word
[1:41:30] molds our character.
[1:41:34] Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] Yes, sir.
[1:41:38] Yeah. So, if you come down. Yes. While
[1:41:41] the brothers are trying to see if they
[1:41:43] can catch that quote, I want you to read
[1:41:46] it yourself so you can see it. If you
[1:41:48] can fall for that in that same message,
[1:41:49] he said that he might he might redeem
[1:41:53] this other thoughts. Uhhuh. God bless
[1:41:56] you.
[1:41:57] Uhhuh. This is another one. Yeah. Okay.
[1:42:00] That's those are my notes. Amen. But if
[1:42:02] you go to the message itself,
[1:42:04] hallelujah, he say he that that he might
[1:42:06] redeem these other thoughts,
[1:42:09] he's going to redeem the other thoughts.
[1:42:13] Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; These other thoughts that was not to
[1:42:18] him. He has thoughts to make a wife.
[1:42:22] If you read that message, hallelujah.
[1:42:25] Amen.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:29] He has thoughts of a bride.
[1:42:32] Amen. Many things that we do even our
[1:42:35] physical life start by thought.
[1:42:39] Yes. So you are what you are by your
[1:42:42] thoughts.
[1:42:45] Hallelujah. You begin to think. So if
[1:42:47] your thoughts are perverted, you begin
[1:42:49] to live a life that is not worthy of the
[1:42:51] gospel.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; A life that is not presentable. It is by
[1:42:55] your thoughts. Because as a man
[1:42:57] thinkketh in his heart. So so Jesus God
[1:43:00] has a thought for a bride a wife is a
[1:43:03] one of his thoughts and because those
[1:43:06] thoughts are eternal they will not
[1:43:07] perish.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; No matter how wicked
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; this age is there will be a bride
[1:43:14] because that thought of God hallelujah
[1:43:16] is an eternal thought.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; No matter what the devil does that bride
[1:43:22] because it's a thought say had that
[1:43:24] thought. Hallelujah. Of having a bride
[1:43:29] and this bride has an eternal quality.
[1:43:32] Hallelujah.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; So in Philippians chapter 2 verse 5,
[1:43:37] what did Paul say? Say let this mind
[1:43:41] be in you
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; that was in Christ Jesus. He said who
[1:43:46] taught it
[1:43:48] not robbery
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; to be equal with God.
[1:43:52] And if you read the Bible very
[1:43:54] carefully, Jesus Christ never played
[1:43:56] with that.
[1:43:58] Him being God,
[1:44:00] he never played with that was the
[1:44:02] problem he had with the Pharisees.
[1:44:06] I came from God. I go back to God. I am
[1:44:08] my father one. They say, "Oh,
[1:44:12] he blasphemes.
[1:44:14] They took stones
[1:44:16] to stone him. That is why they crucified
[1:44:19] him because he make himself hallelujah
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; with God. He say he's God. All you know
[1:44:25] is a carpenter.
[1:44:28] In fact is an illegitimate born child
[1:44:31] before his mother and mama come
[1:44:33] together. The mama was already
[1:44:36] pregnantated.
[1:44:41] This is the same guy standing. I am my
[1:44:43] father and one I came for. I go back to
[1:44:45] God.
[1:44:48] He never compromised.
[1:44:50] So the Bible is telling us, let this man
[1:44:52] be in us that was in Christ Jesus who
[1:44:56] thought it not robbing to be equal with
[1:44:58] God.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Before something happens to you, even a
[1:45:03] confession, the word there worse.
[1:45:05] Hallelujah. Oh my. I'll take my I don't
[1:45:08] know. Yes. I I take my time. I just I
[1:45:12] don't want to bore you. I don't want you
[1:45:13] to sleep. Yes. Yes. There are many
[1:45:15] things we could say. Hallelujah.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; But make sure that you don't sleep. He
[1:45:21] sleep close.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; When you sleep, you are telling that you
[1:45:27] want to go. I want take my hamburger.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Time for lunch. You begin to look at
[1:45:36] what they just close.
[1:45:39] May the Lord help us.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. who thought it not robbly to be
[1:45:44] equal with God. Hallelujah. So thoughts
[1:45:46] are very very key. Hallelujah. Amen. So
[1:45:49] he said Jesus says the words that I
[1:45:51] speak unto you, they are spirit and they
[1:45:53] are life.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:57] Amen. He was he was he was oh my
[1:46:01] hallelujah. So he and the Pharisees is
[1:46:03] if you look at the account John 8:42-43
[1:46:07] Jesus if you were if you if God we are
[1:46:11] your father you would love me for I
[1:46:14] proceeded forth you see the language he
[1:46:16] uses proceed it is words that proceed
[1:46:18] forth
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; it is word that proceed
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; like I'm speaking to you hallelujah amen
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; the washing of the water by the water So
[1:46:31] words are proceeding. Hallelujah. That
[1:46:34] is what cleanses a man. As we speak the
[1:46:37] word is cleansing God's children this
[1:46:39] morning. Hallelujah. He said, "For I
[1:46:41] proceeded forth." Remember he was the
[1:46:43] word of God. When the angel came with
[1:46:46] the word,
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; word was spoken. The womb of Mary was
[1:46:51] open. Hallelujah.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Conceived the word.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Mary's response was, "Let it be unto me
[1:46:58] according to your word. Amen.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; That is the immaculate conception.
[1:47:07] The word coming into your spirit.
[1:47:09] Hallelujah. Coming into the soul.
[1:47:11] Hallelujah.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; To receive begin to form.
[1:47:16] Because she received the word. She gave
[1:47:18] birth to the son of God.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; He said, I proceeded forth and came from
[1:47:27] God. Neither came out of myself but he
[1:47:29] sent me. He say why do you not
[1:47:32] understand my speech.
[1:47:36] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:47:39] You know a speech is a compilation of
[1:47:41] words.
[1:47:43] So you have to understand the words
[1:47:46] before you can a proper understanding of
[1:47:47] a speech.
[1:47:51] They don't have representation in them.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say understand my speech.
[1:47:57] Hallelujah.
[1:47:58] Yes. Even because you cannot hear my
[1:48:01] word.
[1:48:05] Hallelujah.
[1:48:07] Amen.
[1:48:09] So you see thoughts are very key. They
[1:48:11] are very important.
[1:48:14] David said your word have I hid in my
[1:48:16] heart that I may not sin against you. So
[1:48:19] that is why you see the devil what he
[1:48:21] does is to take our thoughts from the
[1:48:23] thoughts of God
[1:48:25] by the things we watch
[1:48:28] the places we go now we have our phones
[1:48:33] much of the things you become what you
[1:48:35] eat where your feet where you feed upon
[1:48:38] what if you eat on the bread man shall
[1:48:40] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:48:43] word that proceedth from her hallelujah
[1:48:46] so that life in you will only crave. We
[1:48:49] always crave to feed from the word of
[1:48:52] God.
[1:48:55] Hallelujah. You may not all know all the
[1:48:57] quotes. So
[1:49:00] you are not a theologian to to memorize
[1:49:02] all the scriptures
[1:49:04] otherwise the Pharisee would have been
[1:49:06] there. They are so trained that they
[1:49:09] know all the scriptures.
[1:49:12] They live a very good moral life. But
[1:49:14] the seed representation in them was not
[1:49:17] of God.
[1:49:20] I remember when Jesus spoke the word
[1:49:23] to the city disciples
[1:49:28] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:49:30] blood you have no part in me.
[1:49:37] It was not a simple statement. We are
[1:49:39] reading it today.
[1:49:42] If she will come, we know they come and
[1:49:46] say, "I'm going to cut my flesh today."
[1:49:48] Church member, each and every one of you
[1:49:50] will eat
[1:49:53] it small thing.
[1:49:58] Yeah. No part in me. Drink his blood.
[1:50:01] I'm going to eat black flesh.
[1:50:05] This man is a vampire. So those who were
[1:50:08] not predestinated, who never had the
[1:50:09] seed of God in them, they never wasted
[1:50:12] any time.
[1:50:15] No, no wasting. They took their bags and
[1:50:18] their sermon books. They left
[1:50:23] this one. Look at this one. Look at this
[1:50:25] one.
[1:50:31] 8 70 left immediately. See a small thing
[1:50:35] in a church like that. 70
[1:50:38] left.
[1:50:42] Even the 12 that remained one that one
[1:50:44] was there.
[1:50:46] 11. Even 11 were also shaking.
[1:50:52] Look.
[1:50:55] Jesus Christ said, "Will you also go?"
[1:50:56] because I saw them trembling,
[1:51:00] doubts in their minds.
[1:51:05] Will you also go?
[1:51:08] Those guys have gone.
[1:51:12] Then Jes Peter,
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; I believe by divine revelation,
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; where would we go when we know that you
[1:51:23] have the words of eternal life?
[1:51:32] Where would we go?
[1:51:35] Which church actually can you actually
[1:51:37] go to attend and be comfortable
[1:51:40] where they will give you communion in
[1:51:42] the morning?
[1:51:43] They baptize the name of father. Where
[1:51:46] can you hear
[1:51:49] which which sermon are you going to hear
[1:51:53] that actually touch your soul?
[1:51:58] Hallelujah.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter confessed, "Where would we
[1:52:03] go when we know that we have the words
[1:52:06] of eternal life?"
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] In verse 47,
[1:52:12] Jesus Christ said, "He that is of God,
[1:52:15] hearth God's word."
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; You see, so it's simple. If you are of
[1:52:20] God, you hear God's word.
[1:52:23] This this some of these they don't need
[1:52:24] interpretation. He that is of God
[1:52:26] heareth God's word. Ye therefore hear
[1:52:29] them not because ye are not of God.
[1:52:32] Jesus Christ was telling the Pharisees I
[1:52:34] think this is John chapter 8 there verse
[1:52:36] 47. He that is of God he go what?
[1:52:41] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And so he said
[1:52:45] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:52:48] the kingdom of God.
[1:52:51] Amen.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Now the titan church age here we're
[1:52:58] talking about say she has no order. She
[1:53:00] has no word but his. The bride has no
[1:53:03] word but his.
[1:53:05] No leadership
[1:53:08] but his. No thoughts but his.
[1:53:13] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:53:16] Amen. He said this. Oh yeah. Baram say
[1:53:20] how sweet are the thought of impance,
[1:53:22] deliverance, justification, forgiveness,
[1:53:25] redemption and divine healing.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; So why if you want to go for to deal
[1:53:30] with you have to forsake your thoughts.
[1:53:32] Isaiah say your thoughts are not. So our
[1:53:34] thoughts are different. So when we come
[1:53:36] we drop our own thinking, our
[1:53:38] reasonings, our senses.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; This word of God has to be revealed
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Paul said the letter kill it but the
[1:53:51] spirit giveth life.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; They take the word. In many churches
[1:53:54] today they are reading this word but
[1:53:56] they don't have the thought behind the
[1:53:57] word.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes even law when you go to a
[1:54:03] physical law when the law they will tell
[1:54:06] the spirit of the law. Amen. You have
[1:54:09] the literal interpretation of the law.
[1:54:11] You have the spirit inter spiritual the
[1:54:14] component. They will say in the spirit
[1:54:16] of the law this law was formed. If you
[1:54:18] go and just take the law, the word the
[1:54:20] literal interpretation you will die.
[1:54:22] Paul said the letter killth.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; The spirit gives life. It is the spirit
[1:54:27] that gives you the thoughts behind.
[1:54:29] Hallelujah. When Jesus Christ said his
[1:54:31] words, amen. Go ye therefore and teach
[1:54:34] all baptizing them in the name of the
[1:54:36] father and the son and the holy ghost.
[1:54:38] These were the words himself.
[1:54:39] Hallelujah. But why is the spirit
[1:54:42] behind?
[1:54:45] He told them to wait.
[1:54:48] Hallelujah.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Go and wait. The author of this word,
[1:54:52] the spirit of the word will come.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; They have to wait.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:02] The day of Pentecost
[1:55:05] when the author of the word came down
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; and dwelt in them then Peter was able to
[1:55:11] have an interpretation of the literal
[1:55:13] word.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; He had the spirit behind those word. How
[1:55:21] can he say go therefore in the name of
[1:55:23] the father, the son, the holy ghost. But
[1:55:25] he told them go and wait don't go yet
[1:55:28] but wait where the teacher. The holy
[1:55:29] ghost is a teacher. The Holy Ghost needs
[1:55:31] to teach you. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost
[1:55:33] is an interpreter. He's a guide. He's a
[1:55:36] comforter. Amen. Say, "Go and wait for
[1:55:39] him." Oh, when that guy came on the day
[1:55:41] of Pentecost, he showed Peter.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; It told Peter
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; that thing that the master said,
[1:55:49] "Father, son of Holy Ghost,
[1:55:52] it's not this because Holy Ghost is not
[1:55:55] a father is not a
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Hallelujah. What is that
[1:56:01] name? Whatsoever we do in word or deed,
[1:56:04] we should do in the name of the Lord
[1:56:05] Jesus Christ. That is why be baptized in
[1:56:08] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. When
[1:56:09] the word came, the Holy Spirit come
[1:56:11] said, "Men and brother, what shall we
[1:56:12] do?"
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Say repent and be baptized every one of
[1:56:18] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:20] Christ.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; The Ethiopian Enoch was reading the
[1:56:23] Bible.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Can you service? He was reading the book
[1:56:27] of Isaiah.
[1:56:29] read
[1:56:31] confusion how he could not understand
[1:56:36] the Holy Ghost the author told Peter
[1:56:40] Philip he said go enjoy that chariot
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; you are reading does that understand why
[1:56:44] he said how can I do if nobody is there
[1:56:46] to explain to me hallelujah
[1:56:48] the Holy Spirit through Pet expounded
[1:56:52] the word to them hallelujah so you see
[1:56:54] the importance of the word can never be
[1:56:56] overemphasized for the bride hallelujah
[1:56:58] Yeah,
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; we don't compromise with the word
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; because this is our life.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; This is this is our lifeline.
[1:57:07] Hallelujah. This is our representation.
[1:57:09] Amen. Becoming the word of God. Amen.
[1:57:15] Jesus Christ say the words that I speak
[1:57:18] unto you, they are spirit and they are
[1:57:21] alive. Because the words of God are
[1:57:23] eternal and real. They cannot perish.
[1:57:26] They will not fail.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; That is why in this end time God brought
[1:57:30] see brother Abraham emphasized on the
[1:57:32] word. The word the temple is the opening
[1:57:35] of the word. Hallelujah. Bringing the
[1:57:39] bride to opposition.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Showing where she is where she's placed
[1:57:46] her position. Hallelujah. Remember you
[1:57:48] forgot. Hallelujah. Amen. He say when
[1:57:51] the seals open the Bible became a new
[1:57:53] book.
[1:57:57] Amen.
[1:57:59] Amen.
[1:58:00] Oh my. Hallelujah. Amen. I remember one
[1:58:05] time in the Bible
[1:58:08] in the book of first kings there.
[1:58:12] There was this guy
[1:58:14] that they call Goliath.
[1:58:19] Very huge. You know the story. He will
[1:58:22] come every morning.
[1:58:24] He will use words
[1:58:27] for 40 days insulting the children of
[1:58:30] God.
[1:58:33] Using words.
[1:58:37] The Bible say even Saul.
[1:58:40] Yes. They were all dismayed.
[1:58:44] They were all
[1:58:46] discouraged.
[1:58:50] What in the morning, watch at night,
[1:58:52] watch in the evening. Every day see
[1:58:55] putting thoughts, taking them. But one
[1:58:58] day
[1:59:00] there was a small boy
[1:59:02] called David.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; If you read the Bible, the Bible say he
[1:59:06] had those words.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] And they told him, who is this
[1:59:15] uncircumcised Philistine?
[1:59:22] that is defying
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; the army of God.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Certain time the devil will come and
[1:59:28] want to defy you with thoughts.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; You are not saved,
[1:59:36] you are this, you are that, you are
[1:59:39] sick.
[1:59:41] You must renounce those thoughts.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible say by his stripes I am
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; healed.
[1:59:49] The chastisement that brought us peace
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; was for him. That is what you should be
[1:59:54] asking.
[1:59:58] And David said those words. If you read
[2:00:00] that, the Bible says some people took
[2:00:03] those words of David and they rehearsed
[2:00:06] them before the king.
[2:00:10] They were precious words. Those words
[2:00:12] has an eternal quality in them.
[2:00:17] I believe if you read the Bible where
[2:00:18] those ones were rehearsed onto the ears
[2:00:21] of Esau, it brought hope.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; It brought hope. The word of God brings
[2:00:27] hope of God's children.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; The word of God takes away distress.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:37] The word of God delivers
[2:00:39] because it is real. It is eternal. It
[2:00:42] has life. It has power. They rehearsed
[2:00:45] those words in the years of Saul and
[2:00:47] Saul receive hope. He said go and call
[2:00:49] him and bring that guy.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Let me just power up the whole story.
[2:00:58] Hallelujah. Because of time. Amen.
[2:01:01] When the confrontation, this battle is a
[2:01:04] battle of words.
[2:01:06] is the things that you hear the
[2:01:08] preaching that's why we preach the word
[2:01:10] to you
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; for you to become the word the thoughts
[2:01:14] of God amen the devil doesn't like that
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; that's right
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; that is why even when you come to church
[2:01:21] he will not stop you from not coming to
[2:01:23] church if you come I will make him to
[2:01:24] sleep so he will not hear the words
[2:01:30] hallelujah and so they rehearse the
[2:01:32] words in yes and When they when the
[2:01:35] battle started before it was a battle of
[2:01:37] what? Before Goliath fell down that
[2:01:38] stone hit him. He was already dead
[2:01:40] before he was by the what?
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. God bless you. Hallelujah.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; I used to I told the church somewhere I
[2:01:48] was tell preaching somewhere I said it
[2:01:50] when we are small
[2:01:52] inside we used to fight.
[2:01:55] You sure said some guys they don't have
[2:01:57] strength they get big mouthful.
[2:02:04] If I catch you, I will finish you. I
[2:02:07] will do you. You come.
[2:02:10] If you're not strong, you fearful.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Wash make like this.
[2:02:19] If I catch him that one, I will flood
[2:02:22] him. He doesn't know me.
[2:02:28] Was before the battle put fear on you.
[2:02:33] But there's one day I saw one guy they b
[2:02:37] when they
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; with all the big mouth
[2:02:46] sometimes. That is what the devil does.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; He's a bluffer.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; He has a bow but no arrow.
[2:02:55] You look at the boy, you are scared.
[2:03:00] And then before the battle, you started
[2:03:02] sayh you come with me spears with go and
[2:03:05] I come with you in the name of the Lord
[2:03:07] Jesus Christ the Lord God of Israel
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; that mention of that name every knee
[2:03:12] shall bow every tongue shall confess
[2:03:14] that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; I was sharing my testimony with my
[2:03:25] brother last night
[2:03:27] back home and then
[2:03:30] I was going to assume an office that the
[2:03:34] first day of me assuming that office a
[2:03:36] big seat to go and sit down there the
[2:03:39] city is so big for me that I'm so small
[2:03:41] so the host of the Lord arose against me
[2:03:45] and then and God spoke to me in the
[2:03:48] dream I came in the morning and I saw
[2:03:51] the evidence of things and I was about
[2:03:53] to go I was ming the first day by the
[2:03:56] time I should enter the door I fell down
[2:04:00] my phones on the ground. I grab did not
[2:04:02] fall down. Then I remember they said go
[2:04:04] back and enter here in the name of the
[2:04:06] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; I came back I say I entered here in the
[2:04:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Oh that name is above all other names.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever we do in word or deed
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; we should do in the name of the Lord
[2:04:22] Jesus Christ. That name should not
[2:04:24] depart.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; That name remember that name is the word
[2:04:27] of God only.
[2:04:30] Hallelujah. Amen. So David rehearsed
[2:04:34] those words. Hallelujah. He say you you
[2:04:38] come with me with spears with bow and
[2:04:39] arrow. I come with you in the name of
[2:04:40] the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. The
[2:04:42] Lord God of Israel. And when he release
[2:04:45] the stone, I believe the spirit of God
[2:04:48] will catch that stone.
[2:04:52] Because what happened here is the spirit
[2:04:55] always accomplish the word. Wherever the
[2:04:58] words go there to confirm the word
[2:05:08] confir
[2:05:12] that word
[2:05:22] is the high priest of our profession.
[2:05:25] He's the high priest of our profession.
[2:05:27] Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; But before you profess, your thoughts
[2:05:30] have to be right. Think right.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; How can you think right? It's only by
[2:05:34] the word of God.
[2:05:37] And the Holy Ghost get a hold of that
[2:05:39] stone. That stone. The way the guy dress
[2:05:42] all dress the little portion. The Holy
[2:05:46] Ghost came down. Hallelujah.
[2:05:49] Directing the stone like this.
[2:05:52] He was looking at everybody was well
[2:05:54] dressed. He came here. a small portion.
[2:05:56] Holy Ghost came.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said it was a mighty
[2:06:05] fall.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus Christ said, "The
[2:06:14] words that I speak unto you, they are
[2:06:16] spirit and they are alive."
[2:06:20] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:06:22] Amen.
[2:06:27] Sometimes I don't want to be too long.
[2:06:30] Hallelujah.
[2:06:32] Amen. Why is the spirit of quick
[2:06:39] speak?
[2:06:43] So when we speak, we speak ourselves. We
[2:06:45] don't speak our thoughts. We don't speak
[2:06:47] our mind. We speak the word of God. That
[2:06:49] is why I believe once we speak the word
[2:06:51] of God, the word of God has power to
[2:06:53] bring healing in your body.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; That circumstance, if it is deliverance,
[2:07:01] the word of God has power to deliver
[2:07:03] you.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; It will deliver you from that situation.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; If only you believe,
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; but must have the right attitude towards
[2:07:13] the word of God.
[2:07:15] If you are sick, just be saying it by
[2:07:18] times I am healed. That is the word of
[2:07:20] God. You confess it. You speak it. The
[2:07:24] Holy Spirit, the spirit will catch that
[2:07:25] word. The spirit of that word will come
[2:07:27] one day and catch that word and manifest
[2:07:29] it in your head.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Because the words that I speak, they are
[2:07:34] spirits and they are alive. Why I'm
[2:07:37] saying I don't know your situation this
[2:07:38] morning. I don't know your condition.
[2:07:40] Hallelujah. But if you believe the word
[2:07:42] of God that this is the word of God, you
[2:07:43] will see the glory of God in your life.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; You will testify for the glory of God.
[2:07:47] Amen. All we need to do is to drop our
[2:07:50] own thoughts,
[2:07:52] our own thinking. Jesus Christ said,
[2:07:54] "Let this mind be you that was in Christ
[2:07:57] Jesus." So you see the word is very key.
[2:08:01] Daniel understood the Bible say by
[2:08:03] books. He went back to the scriptures.
[2:08:05] He went back to the word. Hallelujah.
[2:08:08] Amen. Amen. In the message told us about
[2:08:15] it say he said look into the mirror of
[2:08:16] God the mirror of the world and identify
[2:08:19] yourself.
[2:08:21] I think the message identification 64
[2:08:25] 1964 February paragraph 91. Now let's
[2:08:29] look into God's mirror his word and
[2:08:32] identify your present character by some
[2:08:35] Bible character.
[2:08:38] Look into the mirror of God's word.
[2:08:40] Hallelujah. And try to see yourself in
[2:08:43] the scripture.
[2:08:46] Hallelujah. Amen. When Jesus Christ
[2:08:48] came, Hallelujah. He identify himself in
[2:08:52] the scriptures.
[2:08:55] Read the Bible.
[2:08:57] In Luke chapter 4.
[2:09:01] Hallelujah.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you read the message this this
[2:09:04] day, this scripture is fulfilled. He
[2:09:07] went into the scrolls. The Bible say he
[2:09:09] went into the temple in Luke chapter.
[2:09:11] Yes, I think Luke chapter 4. He went
[2:09:13] into the temple. Hallelujah.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; And he took the book.
[2:09:18] He went to the scripture because of
[2:09:20] time. He read that portion of the word
[2:09:23] that was allocated for him.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say close the book.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; That was his portion.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to identify
[2:09:32] yourself in the scripture.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; That is what the prophet is telling us
[2:09:36] here. Hallelujah. You must see your name
[2:09:39] in the book.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you stand in the mirror
[2:09:45] of God's word, you see yourself.
[2:09:49] Brother said there was this little boy
[2:09:53] that was standing before the mirror. We
[2:09:56] know the story.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:59] He went into his aunt's place and saw a
[2:10:01] mirror for the first time in his life.
[2:10:04] He had don't know what a mirror is. You
[2:10:07] know what a mirror? The mirror of God.
[2:10:09] The one stood before the the mirror like
[2:10:11] this. He saw the see another boy like
[2:10:14] him. Look at him. The other boy looked
[2:10:17] at him. He waved. The boy waved.
[2:10:21] He said
[2:10:25] he shout. The boy shout shouted back. He
[2:10:28] said, "Mama, that's me." Hallelujah.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; He identified himself in the scripture.
[2:10:35] Hallelujah.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; All we need to do is to look at the word
[2:10:38] of God and say, "That is me."
[2:10:39] Hallelujah.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; You claim your promises. You claim the
[2:10:42] blessings of God for your life.
[2:10:43] Hallelujah.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Say, "Search the scriptures
[2:10:50] for in them you think you have eternal
[2:10:53] life." So brother said now look into
[2:10:55] into God's mirror his word and identify
[2:10:58] your present character by some Bible
[2:11:00] character. Hallelujah. Today I see
[2:11:03] Christians want to be like movie stars.
[2:11:08] They want to be like people in
[2:11:09] California
[2:11:11] sisters they want to pattern themselves
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; like them. That is not you.
[2:11:17] Your character is in the Bible
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; mama.
[2:11:22] Leave them with their short skirts,
[2:11:24] with their pants. Leave them.
[2:11:27] That is not you.
[2:11:29] You are different.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; You are dressed with the word of God.
[2:11:34] Mother's apparent decent. When you walk,
[2:11:37] they should this is a Christian going.
[2:11:42] Amen. By taking the word of God, feeding
[2:11:46] the word of God. As you become the word,
[2:11:49] hallelujah. You become like Christ.
[2:11:53] Sometimes sometimes even physical
[2:11:55] appearance will show that this a
[2:11:56] Christian.
[2:11:59] One preacher used to say the malaria
[2:12:01] that inside is what shows in the eyes.
[2:12:08] When you see somebody who is a drug
[2:12:10] addict, when you see from the face, you
[2:12:12] see from the eyes.
[2:12:15] No, nobody. No, nobody. You know that
[2:12:17] this person I should give him way.
[2:12:22] So if you have the word of God in you,
[2:12:24] you have the life of God in when they
[2:12:25] see you, you know that this is a
[2:12:26] Christian.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, there are blessings in
[2:12:33] the word of God.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; There are blessings in this message.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm telling you, my brothers and
[2:12:39] sisters, friends,
[2:12:43] you might even break the law. Policeman
[2:12:45] will look at you. The cops will look at
[2:12:46] you say, "I'm just coming from church.
[2:12:52] Because the spirit of God is around you.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; The word of God is you. Oh. Hallelujah.
[2:12:56] So everything that we need we ever need
[2:12:59] is in the word of God.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; All we need to have faith. Oh I wish I
[2:13:04] had time enough. Hallelujah. So what we
[2:13:07] do we identify ourself. Brother Abraham
[2:13:10] says the scripture say he said to be
[2:13:12] spiritual is to be scriptural.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; So I I used to wonder this statement.
[2:13:17] everything this thing that brother see
[2:13:19] he will just and drop this if you study
[2:13:21] the Bible carefully he will see it
[2:13:22] because just as a prophet
[2:13:26] and I look I said ah say if any man
[2:13:28] thinks himself to be spiritual
[2:13:31] let him acknowledge
[2:13:34] that the things that I said they are the
[2:13:35] commandments of the lord
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; so a spiritual man acknowledges the word
[2:13:39] of god he recognize the word of god
[2:13:41] hallelujah
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; I say oh we have a prophet
[2:13:47] If you see something you don't
[2:13:48] understand look at Peter not everything
[2:13:49] you understood that statement was say
[2:13:52] where would we go today they are
[2:13:54] bringing their own human intelligence
[2:13:56] into the word of God it will not work
[2:14:00] you see science and God they go when God
[2:14:03] takes his he also move now they talking
[2:14:05] about artificial intelligence
[2:14:09] yeah it's good for physically but when
[2:14:11] we talk we have divine intelligence
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; original intelligence
[2:14:15] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; That is not official, original.
[2:14:21] Amen. That comes from above. So
[2:14:24] everything artificial, artificial.
[2:14:26] Hallelujah. Amen. We need a divine
[2:14:29] revelation
[2:14:31] to reveal these things to us.
[2:14:33] Hallelujah. So the scripture,
[2:14:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus identify his
[2:14:38] ministry by the scripture. Hallelujah.
[2:14:42] Even John the Baptist, he went back to
[2:14:44] the world.
[2:14:47] He said they came to him.
[2:14:50] We see this man. We see another man
[2:14:52] preaching. They came to him. They
[2:14:53] thought he was the Messiah.
[2:14:55] In John chapter 3, they said,
[2:14:59] he said, "Are you that prophet?
[2:15:03] Tell us." They wanted an answer so that
[2:15:05] we will go and tell them that sent us.
[2:15:09] Who are you? Who do you say that you
[2:15:11] are?
[2:15:14] He said, I am the voice of, he quoted
[2:15:15] Isaiah. He went back to Isaiah. He said,
[2:15:18] I am the voice of one crying in the
[2:15:21] wilderness,
[2:15:23] prepare the word of God.
[2:15:27] Hallelujah. Amen. He went to the
[2:15:30] scriptures. Hallelujah. The prophet
[2:15:33] identify himself in scriptures.
[2:15:37] In the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:15:38] angel,
[2:15:40] Malachi 4, when he shall begin to shout,
[2:15:43] he identify himself. So the bride also
[2:15:45] has a ministry. We must identify
[2:15:47] ourselves. Hallelujah. In the message,
[2:15:50] in the scriptures.
[2:15:53] But why? Because this is the only thing
[2:15:55] that will last. These are the things
[2:15:57] that will not perish. These are the
[2:15:59] thoughts of God. They are eternal and
[2:16:03] they are real.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I'm soon
[2:16:09] close. Amen.
[2:16:12] Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. On the day
[2:16:17] of Pentecost
[2:16:19] when the Holy Ghost fell.
[2:16:21] Hallelujah. Peter went back
[2:16:26] to chapter 2.
[2:16:29] He said, "This is that
[2:16:31] which was spoken by the prophet Joel.
[2:16:36] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:16:39] This seed that should temporarily me
[2:16:42] permanent in the bride. We are the word
[2:16:45] made flesh today. This is what this
[2:16:47] message all this message has come to do
[2:16:49] is to take us back to the mind of God.
[2:16:52] Take us back to our theophony. Bring us
[2:16:55] closer than ever before. But how? Faith
[2:16:58] cometh by hearing. Hearing by the word
[2:17:01] of God. Amen. As we speak the word, you
[2:17:04] receive the word of God. You receive the
[2:17:06] thoughts of God. You receive the mind of
[2:17:08] God. Hallelujah. And you see the glory
[2:17:10] of God in your life. Amen. My brothers
[2:17:13] and sisters, friends, hallelujah,
[2:17:16] I want to challenge you this morning.

[2:17:24] God, receive God's thoughts concerning
[2:17:27] your situation, because the thoughts of
[2:17:30] God, they are eternal and real. They
[2:17:33] will not fail. They are not perishable.
[2:17:35] You overcome that situation.

[2:17:43] of your son,
[2:17:48] begin to talk to God.
[2:17:50] Say, Lord, this the situation
[2:17:54] I claim the salvation of my son
[2:17:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:18:01] My husband is going away.
[2:18:03] My children are not behaving the way
[2:18:05] they ought to.
[2:18:07] Say, Lord, help me.
[2:18:11] Brother said there was a time because of
[2:18:13] time. Hallelujah. There was a time the
[2:18:15] devil came around uniform
[2:18:26] confess positive things. Hallelujah.
[2:18:30] Some Christians we don't even have the
[2:18:33] habit of confessing good things for our
[2:18:36] even ourselves.
[2:18:38] How can you confess positive things
[2:18:40] about your brother
[2:18:45] say anything about your brother? If you
[2:18:47] don't have anything to say, go and pray.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; May the Lord help us. I don't know your
[2:18:55] condition. I don't know your situation.
[2:18:56] But the Lord knows your situation.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thoughts of God, they
[2:19:01] are eternal and they are real. If it is
[2:19:03] the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost is God's
[2:19:05] thoughts. said this promise is unto you
[2:19:07] and to your children and to as many as
[2:19:09] our Lord God shall call. Hallelujah.
[2:19:11] Amen.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; God can give you the Holy Ghost while it
[2:19:15] has spake these words because Cornelius
[2:19:18] before he was even taken water to
[2:19:20] baptism. Hallelujah. The spirit of the
[2:19:22] word came. Hallelujah. And confirmed the
[2:19:24] word and they received the Holy Ghost.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Why? It's the word of God. Our power,
[2:19:31] all that we need, all that we become is
[2:19:34] in this word of God. That is why God
[2:19:35] sent us a prophet. Hallelujah. Brothers,
[2:19:39] it is this divinely revealed mystery
[2:19:40] truths
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; that will literally turn the heart of
[2:19:43] the children back to the faith of our
[2:19:45] fathers.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; These things that have been hidden all
[2:19:48] around the ages. So that is why we come.

[2:19:53] them. We say amen. As you are saying,
[2:19:55] amen this morning.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Let it be unto you according to your
[2:19:58] word. Hallelujah.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; That is the attitude of Mary.

[2:20:03] Hallelujah. Amen. I don't know if we
[2:20:06] know the song. Let it be unto me
[2:20:07] according to your word,
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; according to his promises.
[2:20:15] I have seen the power of God.
[2:20:18] I have seen the power of God and I
[2:20:20] believe he's here.
[2:20:23] Amen.
[2:20:24] In a still small voice, he speaks. He
[2:20:28] delivers. He changes your situation
[2:20:31] because those thoughts are eternal. And
[2:20:34] there take the thoughts of God. Drop
[2:20:36] your thinking this morning.
[2:20:39] Forget about your human. Your thoughts
[2:20:41] are different from God's thoughts. Take
[2:20:43] the internal thoughts of God. Why did
[2:20:46] the word of God say about my situation?
[2:20:49] That is what I want you to take this
[2:20:51] morning, my brother,
[2:20:53] my sister. Hallelujah. If you do that,
[2:20:56] you believe from your heart, you'll see
[2:20:58] the glory of God. You stand this church

[2:21:15] According
[2:21:17] to your proises,
[2:21:22] I can start
[2:21:29] upon my heart
[2:21:35] and set me free.

[2:21:43] the world
[2:21:48] to me.
[2:21:52] Be on to me. Sing from the bottom of
[2:21:57] your heart
[2:21:59] to your word.
[2:22:04] According
[2:22:05] to your proises,
[2:22:10] I can
[2:22:12] see God
[2:22:17] upon my heart,
[2:22:21] the truth that set me free.
[2:22:27] I'm calling to do your word on.
[2:22:33] [Music]
[2:22:36] Oh, sing it from the bottom of your
[2:22:38] heart.
[2:22:42] To me,
[2:22:45] God is to your word.
[2:22:51] My God is to your promises.
[2:22:56] Oh yes, I got a savior
[2:23:03] [Music]
[2:23:04] of all my heart.
[2:23:09] The joy has set me free.
[2:23:15] My God is
[2:23:17] your word. Lord
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:24] to me
[2:23:27] my brother I don't know you are battling
[2:23:30] with cigarettes smoking
[2:23:32] fornication or whatever it is the Lord
[2:23:35] can deliver you from that situation
[2:23:40] I don't know but the Lord can deliver if
[2:23:43] only you take the thoughts that is why
[2:23:44] he came he died for that purpose
[2:23:49] Salvation is for you.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Drop your thinking. He can do it. He can
[2:23:56] make it for you.
[2:24:02] If you can only go to him this morning,
[2:24:06] he will help you. He's willing to help
[2:24:08] us.
[2:24:10] He's ready to help you. The God of
[2:24:12] Elijah. Hallelujah. That is why he sent
[2:24:15] us a voice in the same time
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:24:19] angel
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; when it shall begin to sound.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; You're praying for the Holy Ghost.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; That is God's way.
[2:24:32] As a young man, you have challenges. You
[2:24:34] cannot help yourself. All you need to do
[2:24:37] as a young sister, say, "Lord, let it be
[2:24:39] to be according to your word."
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's the right attitude. Yes, Lord.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Say amen. Say, Lord, I need your help.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, deliver me.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know your situation. I don't
[2:24:53] know your condition. But the Lord knows.
[2:24:56] If only you believe. If only you trust
[2:24:59] him this morning.
[2:25:02] Take the thoughts of God for your life.
[2:25:06] He wants thoughts of peace.
[2:25:09] Your people bear pleasure.
[2:25:13] You are battling. You need the Holy
[2:25:14] Ghost. Remember, he promised in his
[2:25:17] word. This promise is unto you and your
[2:25:20] children and to as many as our Lord and
[2:25:22] God shall call.
[2:25:28] Surrender your hearts to him and invite
[2:25:30] him into your lives. Let him be unto me
[2:25:31] according to your word. Why did the word
[2:25:33] of God say?
[2:25:36] Say, Lord, I need your help.
[2:25:41] Salvation
[2:25:43] is for you.
[2:25:46] He can set you free.
[2:25:56] Talk to God in your own way. Talk to
[2:25:59] him. It should not be the pastor's fault
[2:26:01] talking for you. You have to talk. You
[2:26:03] have to accept him. You need to receive
[2:26:04] him into your life. Sister, the problem
[2:26:07] you are battling with, if you take the
[2:26:09] thoughts of God into your life, you will
[2:26:10] see the glory of God in your life.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, help me. I need your grace
[2:26:16] this hour, Lord.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; Talk to the Lord this morning.
[2:26:28] Your financial burdens, the Lord will
[2:26:30] take them away. The Lord will open doors
[2:26:32] for you.
[2:26:37] Look at what God says. Look at the
[2:26:38] report. Who has believed our report?
[2:26:41] Don't look at the medical report, the
[2:26:44] doctor's report. But look at what the
[2:26:45] Bible say. He said, "By his stripes, I
[2:26:47] am healed."
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; The chastisement that brought us peace
[2:26:50] was upon him. That is God's word. That
[2:26:53] is God's thoughts. You don't have peace.
[2:26:56] You must invite a prince of peace in
[2:26:58] your life. He will give you peace. Lord,
[2:27:01] I need your grace.
[2:27:05] The thoughts that he has for his
[2:27:07] children, they are thoughts of peace,
[2:27:10] perfect thoughts, thoughts of
[2:27:11] deliverance. He can break that chain,
[2:27:13] break every circumstance that is around
[2:27:16] your lives and we shall see the glory of
[2:27:18] God.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:24] Talk to God in your own way.
[2:27:28] The Lord has been speaking to you.
[2:27:31] This is the time we must be sincere
[2:27:33] before him.
[2:27:36] We must be sincere before him. He's a
[2:27:39] rewarder of them that seek him
[2:27:40] diligently. Lord,
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; he's here the God of Elijah.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; He can serve. He can deliver. He can
[2:27:47] help
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; by the voice, the message. The Holy
[2:27:50] Ghost fell upon them while we make this
[2:27:52] blood.
[2:27:56] Talk to the Lord.
[2:27:59] Oh yes.
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:11] Mary said, "Let it be alto be according
[2:28:13] to your word."
[2:28:15] You must receive the word for the word
[2:28:17] to work in your life. You must accept
[2:28:19] the word for the word to walk in you.
[2:28:22] Say, "Let it be unto me according to
[2:28:23] your word." You must amen the word.
[2:28:25] Believe the word. Accept the word. Stand
[2:28:27] by the word and you shall see the glory
[2:28:29] of God.
[2:28:32] Lead onto me.
[2:28:37] according
[2:28:39] to your word.
[2:28:43] According
[2:28:45] to your promises,
[2:28:50] I can stand
[2:28:53] [Music]
[2:28:58] upon my heart
[2:29:02] that show that set me free.
[2:29:08] I'm calling

[2:29:38] divine healing, the revelation of the
[2:29:40] word,
[2:29:43] deliverance,
[2:29:45] whatever is this, he has paid the price.
[2:29:54] When Jesus died, Baram say he died, he
[2:29:56] paid the price for all the redemptive
[2:29:58] blessings.
[2:30:03] And when a man is born again,
[2:30:06] there is a checkbook that he gives to
[2:30:09] that man or woman.
[2:30:12] Signed with his precious blood the name
[2:30:14] of Jesus.
[2:30:16] All you need to do this morning is to
[2:30:18] fill in the blanks.

[2:30:23] the Holy Ghost. Salvation, it has been
[2:30:26] signed. It will not return back to
[2:30:28] drawer. It will not bounce. The check
[2:30:30] will not bounce.
[2:30:33] He's a rewarder of them that seek him
[2:30:35] diligently.

[2:34:25] of Jesus Christ.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we pray that God
[2:34:30] will take his word. He's uh he's uh he's
[2:34:34] the one that breaks the word down. He's
[2:34:36] the one that address things in our

[2:38:45] You know it is it's comfort comforting
[2:38:48] to know that we are part of God's
[2:38:51] internal thought. Amen. It's it's very
[2:38:54] comforting and like the scripture said
[2:38:57] our brother spoke on that Jesus never
[2:38:59] taught a robbery. He never taught a
[2:39:02] robbery to be equal with God. Here is
[2:39:06] the thing that is dead is dead.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; The sense of pride in this flesh.
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says he never taught a
[2:39:17] robbery
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; but he humbled himself.
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; So you see the battle was to keep
[2:39:23] himself under the word.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; But everything the word spoke about him.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; He believe it.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; Everything he knew that he was a son of
[2:39:32] God. Yes, sir.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; I came from heaven. I go back to heaven.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; I don't have to lift my shoulder. I have
[2:39:38] to keep myself humble to the word.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; Everything the word required of me, I
[2:39:42] will do it.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; But I know I'm not going to perish.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; So that's where the battle is. The
[2:39:51] battle is keeping oursel humble to the
[2:39:54] word.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:57] &gt;&gt; But I mean, we will not rob ourself.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what we go through, we
[2:40:02] know that uh you know it's it's just
[2:40:05] this flesh.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; But inside,
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; you know, you you're listening to David
[2:40:11] pray when he says uh uh uh restore my
[2:40:14] soul.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 23,
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; he asked the good shepherd, restore my
[2:40:20] soul.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; And and and and I think that is the
[2:40:23] thing that God is doing.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; Because you see, you were a soul before
[2:40:27] you became a body.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Praise the Lord.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Is is that soul that is internal. The
[2:40:34] soul is the internal thoughts of God.
[2:40:36] Before you became a body, you were a
[2:40:39] soul. And the real part of you is your
[2:40:42] soul. The part that can perish is your
[2:40:44] soul. It is your soul that picks up the
[2:40:47] new body. When this body drops, the soul
[2:40:50] jump into another body and it runs right
[2:40:53] out of time into eternity. Praise the
[2:40:56] Lord. So you see God word the word has
[2:40:58] come to bring us
[2:41:02] bring bring the identity of our soul to
[2:41:05] possess this body.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; If your soul never feeds hungry. Praise
[2:41:10] the Lord.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; Your soul is not tired.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; It never gets sick. That's the reason
[2:41:16] why your body can be sick. But yet in
[2:41:20] your soul,
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; you stay have strength. You are still
[2:41:24] believing. You are still praising God.
[2:41:26] It is that soul trying to possess this
[2:41:29] body. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. The
[2:41:33] internal thoughts of God. You were a
[2:41:36] thought in the mind of God before you
[2:41:38] became materialized. Praise the Lord.
[2:41:41] That's the reason why no matter what we
[2:41:42] are going through, we can know that his
[2:41:45] thought concerning us
[2:41:48] are precious.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; They are precious thoughts. is to bring
[2:41:54] us to unexpected end.
[2:41:59] Praise the Lord.
