it's good to have uh each and every one of you with us uh just like I said uh we had a good we had a good July 4 Fellowship even though the rain uh was trying to you know the rain was having it well you know uh I mean that's nature but it was it was just such a blessing to me to see Des part of the weather the turn out you know that we were able to make it to get there and we were able to make the best of the time you know were're able to make the best of the time sitting down fellowshipping you know and then uh uh we had a um brother Ariel put up a little game for us to play at the end of the day so it was it was a blessing and just like I said uh at the end of the fellowship that is one of the thing that We crave for as a Church Fellowship we are so spread out around the the the city uh our our facility does not provide us a fellowship hall so when we have those moment they become very very special to us very very special to us if you know how I pray for the fellowship hall you will uh I mean we will start diing I told Brother brother jol maybe we can start in the cry room and make an underground you know dig in the cry room make an underground post stair case everything you know the the fire marshal will not know anything about it you know they came uh they came recently to do uh inspection so we have to put our a sign we have to put our our uh fire extinguisher up the check everything they said is okay so we got them away they are not coming until 3 years before the next inspection we can get the underground set up you know we have we have uh uh a communion this evening and if we had a fellowship hall we could just go down there spend couple of hours fellowshipping with one another and then just come right back up for the communion you know so that's one thing I pray for because uh it's a big part of our growth you know it's our big it's a very big part of our growth the time we spend with one another and uh uh forgive me I'm not making much of a time to spend with you is uh it's all because I have uh I have a hand that is just full of lot of things that are uh I'm ATT ten to but if uh if God give us grace we'll make the time to to be be able to meet up with there praise the Lord and uh uh I forgot something last week and what it was is that uh brother Wesley and sister Cara had their 55 years anniversary praise the lord we want to thank the Lord for that we want to thank the Lord amen amen amen the Lord give them a Grace to their Jubilee amen it's a Grace to their Jubilee so we thank the Lord for that it's uh it's an encouragement to us we that are just starting we will get there amen if we believe it we will get there we that are just starting so it's a big encouragement to us we want to thank the Lord for that and uh thank the Lord for but just like I was saying you know well uh I've always believed and I'm fully convinced of that that it takes a church to make a good pastor a pastor don't make the church that's right is the people that makes the man praise the Lord just like it takes a good wife to make a good husband amen we don't want to believe it sometimes but that's that's the way God designed it let me let me put it in the scripture so I will not have no no uh no qu after service amen that's the way God design it amen it's God's design you know I was I was thinking about that we were going into the word I was thinking about that uh uh just just think about this uh in the book of Ephesian Paul talks about man love your wife and it also talks about a woman referencing her husband which which comes to the place of respect but you see the way that God designed it is that the man is not the love portion is the woman the love portion the reason why the woman crave for love is because she's the love portion now you see so God did it in a way that he acts and the man you know the way he carried himself the way way he do he always want to be respected it's in him you know so now he's asked to be able to give what he don't have which mean he have to learn it the woman is also asked to give what she don't have which means she has to learn it praise the Lord amen she's the love part you know she's the love portion of the relationship is is in her that's what she crave for but when we come to the understanding to realize that you know God designed it that way because it's not something that we give automatically it's something that we learn take it also in the sense of God and in us okay he's the husband of the church you know uh uh when we sing to the Lord we don't say Lord I respect you we say Lord I I love you it's easy for us to say Lord I love you because what he make us his church his love portion amen we owe him respect and what the the the the the scripture says for God so love the word amen so you see there's uh that's the way that God designed it and we are very very very very grateful so I'm uh I'm of a strong conviction of that that it takes a church a people that is willing to work together you know labor together to be able to make a good pastor and you have you have bear with me praise the Lord I'm I'm I'm I'm so glad you have bear with me and I've not done my tongue surgery yet you still make effort to hear me when I talk and uh praise the Lord you have been very patient with me and we are very grateful to there so this morning before we go into the word we want to also welcome another guest uh a little girl praise the Lord and that uh we want to welcome uh Jordan and sister Faith back to church and this morning they will be doing their baby dedication praise the Lord so we will ask uh them to bring the little precious baby up for us amen let's sing that song Jesus love me this I know amen I know I know you have bring them in in your mind

with your husband he told me you were on your way so we were expecting to see you thank you for bringing Jordan and Faith out of the Wilderness praise the Lord amen amen let's turn to neemias chapter 1 neemias chapter 1 this is the seventh month of the year July and is the seventh day it becomes a little bit special to us that these with Biblical numbers so neas chapter 1 we want to read this morning uh and Asi prophet and uh the word of nemiah the son of Hashim and it came to pass in the month of shillo in the 20th year as I was in shushan the palace that Han one of my brethren came he and certain men of Judah and act and I asked them concerning jerus concerning the Jews sorry that have escaped which were left off the Captivity and concerning Jerusalem it will be a little bit lengthy reading the Lord bless you you may have your seat as we continue to read and he said unto me the remnant that are left of the Captivity there in the province are in great Affliction and reproach the word of Jerusalem also is broken down in the Gates thereof are burned with fire I want I want you to to keep that verse in your mind what I want you to keep your in your mind is the walls of Jerusalem are broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire keep that in your mind and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and MN set days and fasted and prayed before the god of Heaven I said I beseech thee Oh Lord God Of Heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth confident and have and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandment let that ears now be attentive and thy eyes open that thou may hear the prayers of thy servant which I prayed before thee now they and night for the children of Israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned it against thee both I and my father's house have seened it I was reading on the on the on the Welsh Revival and just reading some Revival series and and that's that's one of the secret to every Revival repentance praise the Lord is when we can identify the wrong that is done not only pointing it out but also identifying ourself with that wrong praise the lord it's not Lord they need the Lord we need the amen are we together verse seven we have we have dealt very corruptly against the and have not kept the Commandments nor the statutes nor the Judgment which thou commanded th seven Moses remember I beseech Thee the word that thou commanded thy s Moses saying if ye transgress I will scatter you abroad among the Nations but if ye turn unto me and keep my commandment and do them though ye were of you cast out onto the uttermost paths of the heaven yet will I gather them from then and will bring them into a place that I have chosen to set my name there now these are thy servant and thy people whom thou Redeemed by thy great power and by that strong hand oh Lord I beseech thee let let now now th ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper I pray thee thy servant this day and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this man for I was the king's cup Bearer amen this morning I want to speak on the king's cup Bearer praise the Lord the king's cup Bearer that's what I want to speak on this uh this morning by the grace of God let's go to chapter two chapter 2 will give us a little picture of uh neiah before his bus and it came to pass in the month of Nissan and if you look at the Timeline neemias did this prayer and according to history it was three months after that he will find himself before the king in the 20th year of aexi the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine and give it unto the king now I had not been Before Time side in his presence it would give us it would give us an idea the the the position of the king's cup Bearer now is called the cup Bearer not only because he was there to self wine but it was actually uh it was a high ranking of office it was a very serious job it was a very serious job as we will look into it a little bit the man that was a cup Bearer as I look into few uh commentaries and and and look into few history the cup Bearer were historical it an officer of a high rank in Royal cards who bear whose Duty was to pull and to save drink at the Royal table on account of the constant fear of plot so his job was to make sure whatever the King was eating or drinking was correct and what he would do actually is that he would taste the wine before the Kings drink it so if we sum up everything if I if I I just if I just read uh uh some of all that is said here you will realize this position was a position of a man that holds the King's life In His Hands praise the Lord now it will it will it will it will give us an idea why chapter 2 had to reference I have never been inside in his presence because the man that is the king's cup Bearer the Kings watch his every move this is the man that that sign out the food that I eat the water that I drink praise the Lord if anybody should convince him or go through him it's easy for the king to L his life praise the Lord another commentary that I read from says is a position of high influence power and Trust by testing the king's drink for person literally he he the King's life in his key another commentary say because of the sensitivity of the position the cupbearer were generally Uno so he cannot assassinate the king to take over the trone because he does not have no s Sons to follow him praise the Lord so you realize that it was a very very serious job so neemias testified that now I had not been Before Time s in his presence wherefore the king said unto me why is that continence s seeing thou are now sick th this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then I was so very so afraid because now the king is sensing his move the king is looking at him now recognizing that the sorness of his heart for Jerusalem is now beginning to affect the way he was walking the way he was doing things and the king is beginning to sense that and said unto the king let the King live forever yeah you are assuring the king there is nothing PL yet your TR is forever oh King praise the Lord why should not my continence beide when the city the place of my father's seprate lie waste and the gates whereof I consume with fire praise the Lord now he mentioned the place of his father sepre it's a smart way of saying referring to Juda or to Jerusalem he could not say Jerusalem because the King has has has has already passed you go back in the book of e Ezra you will see that uh when they were building the War the King has passed a commandment for the work work to stop so if he refer back to that it will become a political issue so now he's saying the place of my father's sepa the place I was born the place I Lay My Father down is lying waste I'm worried about it are we together then the king said unto him for what does there make requests so I prayed to the god of Heaven and I said unto the king if it pleased the king and if th servant have found favor in th sight that thou who sent me unto Judah unto the city of my father's sepra that I may build it and uh the king said unto me the queen also sitting by his side how long shall th joining be it's said it's another clude also there that uh uh the king is still investigating is it guy running away have he set a bomb in my house you want to escape so how long are you going to be away are we together that is all to say how sensitive the work of the cup bearer was in Asian time praise the Lord so he he told the king uh how long he will be away and the King gave him command and wrote a letter and that he took over and uh he was able to go and carry out there but why this is also important is that U when you go to Daniel chapter 9 you go to Daniel chapter 9 if we want to turn there quickly that uh uh we just we just trying to use this few time and break break ourself out of our nervousness and uh get down to speaking praise the Lord Daniel chapter 9 is is one of uh uh very very very uh uh beautiful powerful scripture in in history now you read this is when the angel Gabriel will come to Daniel Daniel year has is reading Jeremiah report and uh he's concerned about the building now J Daniel year was uh before the Exile before the children of Israel I mean during the Exile let me not say before the Asad I'm wrong during the EZ when the children of Israel were taken down to Babylon we know what the story is now so there in Babylon Daniel had this visitation with his concern for Jerusalem the SC concerned that neemias is sharing he had this visitation of the angel Gabriel and the angel Gabriel will come down and instruct uh uh Daniel how many time is left what God is doing what is actually happening the you people should be in Babylon when you will be out in order of that uh biblically we treat that as the the the the sixf purpose amen the 70 weeks of Daniel now why is important what I what what I want to link here uh we will see that quickly let's turn to D Daniel 9:24 he goes right into SE into the 70 weeks 70 weeks are determined upon thy people which are the Jews and upon the holy city to finish the transgression to make make an end of sin and uh to make reconciliation for iniquity to to to bring the Everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy that's the sixfold purpose that is in the Daniel 7th week and uh and talking about the 7th week let me just say this also you will realize that many people struggle in calculating in the 70 weeks because what we don't appreciate is that for us as Gentiles we only have weeks of days we have weeks of days what does that means seven days make a week praise the lord we love to say four weeks makes a month but it's not correct because we having 30 months that have 31 days and certain months that have 28 or 29 days so for us our Gentile calendar we only have weeks of days but the Jewish calendar they have weeks of days they have weeks of weeks that's what you will see in the in the Passover weeks of weeks they have weeks of months and they have weeks of years praise the Lord so the 70 weeks calculating the 70 weeks to be able to come up with the exact time is weeks of years praise the Lord if you count a 70 week according to the Gentile calandar you will never be able to come up correctly you see that's the reason why many times Gentile uh uh predition on Prophecy we are always off we are always off because we are using a a a gentile calendar a Roman Calendar to be able to interpret a Jewish prophecy the Jewish Carina fits in because every month is 30 days are we together okay now so in verse 25 knowing therefore and understanding that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build Jerusalem onto my Mah the prince shall be seven weeks and three scores uh uh and two weeks the street shall be built again and the walls in troublous time now so that's where this prophecy links to what is happening there remember nemiah said he was troubled when he heard that the gates and the walls of the city was thrown down now what God told Daniel year he's about to fulfill it you have to remember the difference between nayas and Ezra Ezra is the rebuilding of the temple nayas is the rebuilding of the wall are we together praise the Lord I've got a little bit of nervousness out now all yet so let's get into what we want to say this morning let's get what what in what we want to say this morning if you look in the scripture you will realize that U there are some things that God placed in the scripture that are very very unique we're going to talk about the cup Bearer his position but let's look at cup let's look at Cup this morning you realize Jesus at the end of his ministry he says Lord let this cup pass over me okay he said let this cup pass over me when uh uh when Joseph knew that his brothers have come to buy Grain in Egypt and he really wanted to see Benjamin praise the Lord the Bible said he took a silver cup and he asked his men to hide it in their grain and put their money back a silver cup and and leted them to go and then it was it was Joseph own silver cup his own drinking cup the Bible says it was a saver cup saor represent Redemption praise the Lord Israel was facing their first part of the the uh prophecy of Redemption if you look in Genesis you realize that uh uh uh Joseph had two dreams where the wheat were biding the first one was of his brothers that was the Fulfillment in Egypt the second one both his mom and his dad also bow down to him that was not fulfilled that will not be fulfilled until Israel is Redeemed by the two prophets praise the Lord amen because if it was just a natural prophecy that that pertains to Egypt the prophecy would be wrong because Rachel died before they went to Egypt but you see Revelation chap 12 bring us an explanation of that prophecy you read Revelation 12 you see Joseph second dream in Revelation chap 12 represented by the moon the mother the son the Father the 12 Stars the 12 brothers are we together are we together amen I know I'm giving you a lot of information I know I'm giving you a lot of information so Joseph hide his dream I mean sorry hi his cup in the green and when the me when the when his brothers were gone he sent his men to to get them they brought them back how can you be so mean how can you be so wicked we fed you we took care of you someone have stolen the bus cup and you know they make the noise and the the I mean uh uh uh Ruben and his brothers they were show that no we have not done this when it went in check the cup is there so Joseph now will use that cup what was playing out Redemption praise the Lord your seed shall so join in a strangely and with a mighty hand I will bring them out everything playing out in the drama Joseph put himself together he's he's never he he he he want to expose himself to his brother but he cannot do it because the 12 Brothers have to be there to bow down before him and you know the rest of the brothers and the 11 brothers and and I mean he he tried to contain himself lock this man up you you guys a liar lock him up until you bring your little brother Redemption playing out God playing out his great Redemption story in the life of those men and they have no idea praise the Lord and they will go and bring Benjamin and then finally Joseph will reveal himself to his brothers praise the Lord amen he will make himself known to his brothers they will go and bring uh his death dead and they will all move so we see that in that in that Redemption promise for the Jews a silver cup played a very important role you have to remember Jacob was not willing to let Benjamin go to him Joseph was dead amen if yall go down there and Y mess up yall will stay there this is my last born this is this is uh you know uh h i mean I have him for he and his brothers so something have to play out for JO for Jacob to finally say okay you're so honor that God took cup a saor cup in Redemption and yet Jesus here for the Redemption of the word paying the price of the word he's also using the cup let this cup pass over me at the Passover he took a cup and he said this cup represent the New Covenant of my blood all speaking about Redemption and even I I just I just I just I just BM into that as I was as I was looking into cup all through the week amen I was drinking from bottles but I was looking into cup amen I just I just found out that uh uh at the Jewish Passover they have four cups I speak I speak a little bit about that this evening it's not part of what we want to talk about this morning they have four cups at their Passover when they are doing their Passover they have four cups and they took that from Exodus chapter 6 Exodus chapter 6 where the four promises are maybe I can read that quickly for you and uh uh praise the Lord amen Exodus chapter 6 if you read verse four no Exodus 66 let me just read the verse there reading verse four will give us a long reading 66 wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from honor bondage of the egyp yyp I will raid you out of the bondage I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgment and I will so they call that the the four our wheels so at at every Jewish Passover they having four cups that represent that Exodus 6 and they read this EX chapter 6 because it's tied to their covet and we speak a little bit about their this evening just just a short exhortation before we go into praying and uh so uh uh but Jesus at the Passover he took one cup that's what the scripture says and I believe for many of the Jewish Peters and and and and and all of those Jewish boys that were there it was strange to them that he's taking one C and he's not going by the tradition why why was that is because what Moses Tau them year he was the Fulfillment amen he was fulfilling so in uh fulfilling the prophecy you don't have to play out the prophecy you are the Fulfillment so he said take this cup and he identifyed the cup with himself it's my blood the the blood of my new uh of the New Covenant take the bread it is my body praise the Lord now after after Joseph putting the SA Cup in the grains of his brother the next the next time we will see cup there also will be the story there in Genesis 40 about uh uh the Baker and the cup Bearer that is bringing your you know their dreams to Joseph for the interpretation here said God said it at that place also where this man will be free Redemption again he will be free from praising amen and the other man will die why because the bread represent his body his body will die the the wine represent his blood that gave a life it will set him free and it will set us free are we together so we see there's another place there where uh uh cup Barr comes in the scripture but saying out of there this morning I want to I want to go another route praise the Lord I want to take you down a little Rabbit Trail don't worry you will not know if we get lost because I won't tell you praise the Lord amen you know I'm always driving with someone and it says oh sorry I I missed my exit I say you don't have to tell me I didn't know where we were going now you make me more nervous when you tell me because when I miss the ESS I don't talk I just keep discussing I'm worrying if I will find my way back I don't want to make the the trip more better I don't tell you now so let's let's look at this together let's look at this together what we want to look at here is that seeing our lord Jesus the Fulfillment of of all the old test prophecy at the last hour of his life he's taking this Old Testament prophecy and he's bringing us to the place where he's identifying himself with the wine he's identifying himself with the bread he's identifying himself with the entire Passover because he was the Fulfillment of everything amen so thinking about this I want us to look at it this way as the Lord as we would trust the Lord to give us Grace Let's uh let's just read something here Fellowship by Redemption let's read uh uh a little quote here as we want to set up on this they went to fooling in God in in in in the human's heart he's talking about science talking about doctors and they found a little bit of compartment in there that has that the hasn't even got a blood cell around it or nothing it isn't in the animal's heart or the bird's heart or no other heart but the human heart a little bitty place and is called the occupation of the Soul so this was a discovery whether it was it was doing a a uh a heart surgery or what but they were able to find a a compartment there in the in the human heart that there was no blood cell around it just a little place a tiny little place and and and and medical science starts to think there well you know what could this be the the the place of the human soul because you see the the the the the doctors can do a byass surgery they can do a cardiac surgery you know they can work on your heart and and and you know make your heart to work again but you see what the Bible says love the Lord with all of your heart is not that muscle that beats and pump the blood love the Lord with all of your soul you can be able to open the human body and find it science is only saying could this be the compartment where the human soul and the spirit dwells are we together because the Bible says God made man and he he breath into man and Man became a living Soul so we know that that soul in a man is the Breath of God are we together so it is it is it is it it's somewhere in our body and that's the thing when it leaves us the doctor pronounce us dead amen that's the thing when he leaves us the the doctor pronounce us dead so it's called the the the the occupation of the soul that little place that's what science is saying let's take another one here life now but God in his great economy of mankind has made man in the way that he he wanted man to be now he made man and to thirst now so what I'm trying to draw here is that in that little compartment God plac something the Breath of God when he breath into men in that little compartment the Breath of God dwells there and it is that birth that give us test it's the breath that give us desire that's what thirst is amen are we together so God made man the way he wanted man to be he he made man to thirst did you notice David said my soul thirst for thee my soul that little compartment whatever is in that little compartment thirst for God and that's the way that God made us praise praise the Lord he designed us and in us he placed something that thirst for him something that long for him that want to be like him amen that want to know him David said my soul thirst for thee oh I love that as in a dry land where there's no water just imagine said my soul is so thirsty God I'm thirsty for you just like I was in the land where there was no water he must find water or perish my soul is thirsting for thee now God made a man with a thirst praise the Lord so you see what I'm trying to show is to see how the soul is linked with our thirst whatever our thirst is we are having whatever we are Desiring and longing for is coming from our soul my soul thirst for thee praise the Lord and when you are thirsty what do you do you get a cup to drink are you see in the picture when you are thirsty what do you do you get a cup to drink so let me just go ahead of myself because you know me when I get excited I forget about time okay so that little compartment is God's Cup in you you are his cup Bearer hallelujah praise the Lord you are God's cup Bearer you are the king's cup Bearer in you that's a cup that he placed there praise the Lord and the position of the of the cup Bearer you hold the life of the king in your hands can I preach now praise the Lord amen you you are the king's cup Bearer he plac in you a compartment to long for him to be able to quench The Thirst of the dying word praise the Lord to put smile on people face and make people you know uh Happy give them comfort and and and and and show the love of God you are the king's cup Bearer that's what he gave us that compartment for the Bible say he made man and he breathed into man he put his life in that little place for you to be the bearer of his life praise the Lord his purpose was not just to make us to come here and and do whatever we wanted to do with our life he have a purpose amen are we together my soul thirst for thee Oh God God made man with a thirst that's a part of the human being is his thirst we all have it we all have it we have desires praise the Lord there are things that we desire we long for you see but that t was given to us for us to long for God but because we were born in sin bypassing God's plan our thirst has been perverted praise the Lord you see that's the reason why no matter what a man desire and long for it never satisfi praise the Lord but when the man has God within he's content with what he has it brings some sense of satisfaction are we together praise the Lord amen I want to say am I making sense but sometimes it don't make sense praise the lord we have we have to dash in it amen we have to hear what the spirit is saying to the church glory be to God hallelujah [Music] amen amen let's take this other little thought here you know I'm I'm trying to slow down from from just reading you bunch of quotes because that is just all information sometimes all the same codes are saying the same thing praise the Lord So reading 20 quotes does not make me a good preacher if I can't bring the TS to you I don't want to get the quot to you you have it on your phone you have it on your alpad what I want to get to you is what the holy spirit is saying to the church what the Holy Ghost is saying to Good Shepherd Fellowship this morning that's what I want to bring to you that you are God's cup Bearer he took you from the Maring clay he wash you by the water of the word and Jesus said out of you will flow Living Waters your cup will run over your cup should be running over our lives should be quenching The Thirst of thirsted people on the street the church has made a poor example of himself people that are going to church are no different from them that are in the word amen the moras the dress C we have made a poor example but here the responsibility of the church the reason why he call us is to be a bearer of his life and eternal life is living for others is to be a bearer of his life are we together beginning ending of gentle dispensation let me share this one with you no wonder David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want how he leadth he lead us beside a Still Water he restore our soul and run our cup over amen and anoint Us in the presence of our enemy the Bible says if a man wears pleas say the Lord even his enemy will be a pece of him amen which mean your cup has run over that they can drink from your saucer when your cup runs over they will drink from your saucer praise the Lord because they just appreciate the way you talk they appreciate the way they see you and your family live happily they appreciate I mean there there is some some sense of value are we together praise the Lord that's the king's cup Bearer just imagine this man the responsibility that he have sometimes the the POS position of the cup Bearer if if you if you if you uh uh uh uh read Exodus account the Bible call him the chief cup Bearer the chief uh buckler he was the chief so he was not he was not cooking meals you are not washing dishes he was a high ranking officer a man that is on a serious Duty he's protecting the King's life he holds the secret of the Kings praise the Lord when the king wakes up in the night and he's he's angry he needs a wine to calm him down he called the cup Bearer praise the Lord even sometimes when he can't trust his wife he trust the Bearer praise the Lord amen I I I don't know what she's doing I mean you you think about think about Vash the king call her and and she can't come go back to Esther read that story he set up a feast he called why who said the wine it was the cup Bearer praise the Lord he holds the life of the king in his hands and what I'm trying to bring it down to this morning is to show our position is to show what we are called to not just to warm the bench in church not just to become a church member but to know that Amen in US dwell a place where almighty God want to Dell he want to come down and were in you praise the Lord then we can say it is no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me praise the Lord when people says what I mean what what I mean that I I don't understand this life you can tell them look me my real me my real me was me praise the Lord my real me was me I used to be a mean guy but I have become the king's cup Bearer praise the Lord I used to be a roughan I used to be rude but I have become the king's cup Bearer praise the lord I can't drink and do these things is because I'm the king's cup Bearer I don't want to contaminate the wine and kill the king I got to keep myself separate I got to keep myself dedicated and committed to the king and I'm talking about the King of Kings and the Lord of Lord that's why we are Cal that's what the church is all about that's what Christianity is all about is for you to be a bearer of his life not a member of a church but a bearer of his life praise the Lord think about David men think about those men that knew that David was anointed by Samuel to be king think about those men that will put their life into Jeopardy that Immortal men just like them will say oh bethem I just want to get a drink from Beth and those men will put their life on the line they will go fighting just to bring water from the whale of Bethlehem to quench the test of King David praise the Lord amen and here y here is a another a cry here is a god that is having thirst with all the ftiness he seed on the Earth all the perversion he's seen on the earth who will uphold the standard of God all in marriage who will uphold the standard amen that a young man should hold or a young woman should hold there's a God that is thirsting praise the Lord are we ready to put our life on the line and say God I will I will bring something to quench your test by the grace of God hallelujah oh my praise the Lord are we together you see our responsibility Paul says he that is called to be a steward must show himself faithful if you are not faithful you cannot be trusted as a it's an office of trust it's an office of trust the king trust this man so much praise the Lord hallelujah oh my you read first king chapter 10 of Chronicle 2 Chronicle chapter 9 you see you see where the the the the Queen of Sheba when she came and visited with Solomon and she saw all the wisdom of Solomon she said uh she said uh she make mention I mean that's that's that's one of the reference where the uh the the the cup be was also mentioned she talks about all the people that stood in the presence of the king and she said how blessed how blessed you guys are that you see these things on the daily basis to be in the present to see his wisdom in his judgment remember she traveled so far and she said the cup Baron and and and all of that you know what and and and sometimes that's that is the way it is with us oh I you know I believe that I believe I been serving the lord you know for this right I believe the message sent this I believe this and and we take this so common praise the Lord but she said how blessed are these people that are in the presence of the king praise the Lord that can be able to type and benefit from his wisdom in every every ways of their life and that's the place where we are because men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God praise the Lord amen Christians take their church membership more than the Bible more than the word of God more than the word of God are we together so I think you see where I'm going with this thing this whole thought of uh the cup Bearer Hallelujah David said as the deer panted after the water Brooks as the heart panted after the water broke so my soul tested for thee Oh God could you imagine a little deer with blood streaming out of it and run down and Horn is right behind it and it got his little no nose up trying to Snee where there is water praise the Lord and I'm telling you that's what it is the Bible says there will be a farming and is for the word of God praise the Lord amen there is a fing for the word of God because the church has just become a shua Gathering praise the Lord and all that is brought is just some kind of a Entertainer that even brings ungodly joke in the church just to be able to entertain the people and there are Sons and Daughters of God that are out there in the world whose heart is longing for God longing for the word of God where my soul can be FedEd where I can hear truth and address my life condition as I have panted after the water brush David said so my soul test after thee praise the Lord why is that thirst why is that thirst why is it that that that that that that there is just there is just that feeling of not being fulfilled what is what is it of that feeling that we just need something a little more where is it coming from praise the Lord your cup is empty your cup that that little place in you is longing for the Creator he's the only one that can satisfy he's the only one that can satisfy I will tell you that uh h h h uh our parents yes before ages before even this great United States with all that we have and Ai and and and everything and advancing in technology there are men and women that live on this soord that live a life of comfort satisfaction with the little that they had they were still riding on hen Bergie they never had our all our different vehicles that we are building we are even making one that my start flying and we will get in it and yet we will not be satisfied I was just telling a friend of mine brother brother joose said I preached for the last week we're just fellowshipping together just talking about some few things I always enjoy when these guys come we challenge ourself sometimes we get it hard amen we keep it away from you amen it's not it's not Church matter it's just our own personal things but we were just fellowshipping together and I was telling him I say I say I say I mean the Lord really there with me last last year and and and he brought my mind to a place I says we live in such a time where even even in the church among the ministry we we we are looking for convenience convenience is one of our biggest struggle I said I told him I say but h h h what blessed me was to be able to realize that when you look at men of all and you look at men that brought Revival men that were able to impact their generation they inconvenience them themselves to be able to take the gospel out praise the Lord they inconvenience thems because they wanted one more soul to be Sav they wanted to look for the place and and where the god gospel has not gone they will sell their Farm put their their their family together the inconvenient thems to be able I said but you see laal age is a age that is never satisfi praise the Lord and now the age has come to tell us that convenience is God's blessing it has being able to Define God's blessing at as as a state of convenience oh definitely God blesses his people amen the scripture says there is surely a rest for the people of God God gave his people rest he blessed us with good health bless us with good family bless us with good homes praise the Lord hallelujah but you see when when when God blesses us when he fill our cup is because he wants someone else's to drink when he fill our cup he wants someone that is thirsty to be able to see that there is water down there I need to go there and drink are we together the king's cup Bearer we hold the King's life in our hands praise the Lord if the people of this word will know what it takes to live in the sweetness of the Holy Ghost they must be able to to taste it from our life amen that's what we are called to oh yeah and and the devil knows that very well so he fights us on every front but we have to know that it is our responsibility praise the Lord it is our responsibility anybody that want to get to the king knows there you know if they can be able to convince the king cup be if they can just be able to detour him a little bit create some distraction but he know he has to work he has to work if there is smoke that is in the kitchen he's going to summer everybody praise the Lord because he's the one that will be here responsible if there is smoke in the kitchen are we together and that's what I want to bring us this morning like I said we have a service this evening I won't keep you I won't keep you like I I normally do praise the Lord give you just a few time and we'll be back uh 3:30 4:00 we'll be back this evening for our prayer meeting and community service so that's what I want to bring us this morning and just and just make us to think think about these things think about these things Medical Science has Prov it there's a place the longing that we have in our heart there a place and God created that place left it special with no no

opportunity we will we will look into this more further amen fill my cup Lord I Lift It Up praise the Lord you know I was thinking about this song yesterday and I was saying fill my cup Lord I lift it up and then we see Bread of Heaven how you can fill the cup with bread shouldn't it be wine of Heaven you see but you see the the the thought right there is that the writer is under inspiration what he's taking in in that song is the wine and the bread because that's what Christ represent to us he represent the wine and the [Music] bread praise the Lord I hope that we can be able to realize the things that is creating Desires in our heart it's good to have it it's good to desire it's good to have a longing but I what I want us to realize is that it's only his presence that can satisfy no pleasure of this word will ever be able to satisfy that longing in your heart [Music] we thank God for the many ways that he has blessed us there's no amount of money we fill that place there's no amount of w and and and Wally gos that we have God created that place in us for him to dwell his desire is to dwell Among Us is to dwell in us he's the only one that can change our lives he's the only one that can take all the W desires and all the W habits and and the things that we are struggling with in our life there is no therapy that can take it away from us until he comes down endure it in

an example to someone we don't think about telling someone about Jesus [Music] the desire of sharing our testimony what God has done for us that the same God that have done this for me can do it for you that is the failure of this last day church we don't have Bibles evangelist we just have church evangelist [Music] we are all gone away from the street corners we don't want to be identified in
