been a tremendous blessing and um he is welcome to come again we might have some few special meetings in August and we are trusting that God will make a way for him if those meetings happen I'm happy also to be with my wife sister Annie um I don't know whether you've been introduced to her but whether you have been introduced or not it gives me joy to introduce the most beautiful best cook in the whole world my my my life companion we are always together uh I always give this little story of this old Pentecostal Elder who was not very educated but he loved the Lord so much and he had a real experience of the new birth so the pastor once in a while would always give him to say a word or two so there was a wedding in the church and newly worded couple so the pastor after doing the ceremony said we ask our Elder to just come and say a few words I mean the Elder to this newly worded couple so the Elder came and blessed them and said you know you must stick together in the hard times always be together in the good times always be together and he says you be like Paul and Silas his wife they were always together he did not know that Silas was not Paul's wife but he was a very spiritual man I mean gifted in the spir but reading the Bible was was his problem so he so he he thought Silas was the wife of Paul says be like Paul and Silas his wife they went to prison together wherever they were they were together so I always call my wife Silas so it's my joy to present to you sister Silas can you stand sister chosi my blessed [Applause] wife amen so I'm so thankful it is was a joy today to get to meet brother Isaiah Brooks it has been a long long time I guess I'm 30 Old years we we haven't met for a long time but we remember very well just like yesterday when he visited Us in Zimbabwe in our church in muari he stayed in our home and it was our joy to host him we had wonderful meetings and meeting him after so many years I said to him you haven't changed much the only thing that's changed is is the hair that's that's uh that's betraying that you've been a around for a while and he says you haven't changed also only thing is you look a bit taller I said I said I don't think so I think I've lost a bit of weight so when you lose weight you look you look taller so it was nice meeting brother Isaiah Brooks and thank you very much for the sacrifice to drive all the way to come and be with us with the other saints that traveled with you and I also saw my son Samuel Chessa what a joy us to see a Zimbabwean a Zimbabwean smile a Zimbabwean welcome and uh his father was a close friend brother blessing and uh we worked very well in the ministry together and we happened to come from the same rural area in muari District there so we were quite bied when we would meet we always speak in our real deep uh dialect which others who live around the Harari area would never even understand but such was our bond and our friendship and it's good to see his son and to get to know that he's also ministering and God has been using him we thank God for that God who is rich in Mercy so without wasting much time I would like us to stand at this time and I'll pray before we read the scripture if you have any request something that you would like God to do for you you can raise your hand to God and he is still in the business of answering prayer he said where two or three are gathered in my name I'm in the midst of them so if you believe raise up your hand as we pray our commit your request to God lord Jesus we've invited you to come the song service has gone Lord Jesus the preliminaries have gone now the most important part of the service is upon us to preach the word to hear the word and Lord your word has the answer to everything that we have need of and Lord you have seen the hands which have been raised up by your children I want to lift up these hands also in prayer and saying oh Lord you who gave the promise that whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive and you shall have God I pray I present each request Before the Throne of Mercy knowing that you are the great high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities we want to thank you already for a finished work we thank you for answering us now Lord may you bless your word and bless our fellowship in Simplicity and in humility we approach the service in Jesus name amen amen I wish to read from the book of Matthew chapter 16 and also Revelation chapter 1 in Matthew chapter 16 I wish to read from verse 13 to verse 18 and then from Revelation chapter one I'll read just verse one so let's start with Matthew chapter 16 from verse 13 when Jesus came into the courts of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered and said unto him blessed that thou Simon but Jonah for Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art at Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen let's go Revelation chapter one Revelation chapter one I read verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated let's look at the little title of revealing the mystery of Jesus Christ revealing the mystery of Jesus Christ we find here in the scriptures in Matthew Jesus is asking his disciples the people's opinions of him who do men say I am and why does that question come who do men say that I am this question comes because Jesus was a mystery that's why the question is coming the question what is the people's revelation of the mystery of who I am that's what is asking what's the people's Revelation what what do they think of me who do they say I am and the Book of Revelation which we read just starts there on verse one and IT addresses the issue of who Jesus is and he says the revelation of Jesus Christ so wants to bring who Christ is he wants to reveal the mystery of who Jesus is this is the answer to the question who do men say that I the son of man am so Revelation comes up the revelation of Jesus you want to know who he is this is the Revelation so the revelation of Jesus Christ that's in Revelation in other words the revelation of the mystery of who Jesus Christ is so let's look at this Jesus was a mystery his mysterious birth made him the mysterious person you cannot have a mysterious birth and then just be an ordinary person he was a mystery and his mysterious birth made him such a mysterious person in Genesis 3 on verse 15 he was the promised woman's seed how strange how mysterious how can a woman have seed it meant right there he was going to be virgin born he was going to come by Immaculate Conception which is evidenced by Isaiah 7 on verse 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son amen and shall call his name Emmanuel now in Matthew 1 on verse 23 it gives the meaning of Emmanuel behold the Virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us God With Us god with us as a child god with us as a son God With Us that's mysterious yeah how can God who is Spirit come to be a son to be a human being who dwells with us that that's a mystery no wonder why Jesus had to ask them hey who do people say that I am he knew who he was but he knew he was mystery to the people want to he wanted to check their Revelation and their Revelation was the cause of their rejection of him you could not be saved by a person that you were assuming to be a Jeremiah you couldn't be saved by a person whom whom you were assuming to be one of the prophets or to be or to be Isaiah that person could not possibly save you because Isaiah was not a savior neither was Jeremiah a savior for you to be saved by him you had to know he was Jehovah savior Jehovah in flesh he was Emmanuel God with us so he is he is he is cheing their Revelation here and may God help us to to revisit our revelation of who Jesus Christ is he he's more than just the man of Galilee he's more than just the Bible that we hold he is a living God living inside of you and me amen God with us as a son Son of God that is very mysterious God becoming a person God becoming a human being God becoming one of us no wonder the question was posed who do men say I am sure he was not an ordinary person he was very different he was very unique a virgin born son how can it be that's mysterious so he says who who do you think I am when you look at the way I came with when you look at the things I'm doing walking on the water and uh curing the Fig Tree and uh casting out devils and uh opening blind eyes and raising up the dead multiplying the laes and the fishes who do you think I am and who do you think he is he's the son of the Living God he's here tonight he's here tonight he's alive and well and is more than willing to sort out all our problems all our frustrations all our mind battles all our depressions and all our needs and desires is more than able to supply that's mysterious who do men say that I this Myster serious person am what is their revelation of me Matthew 1:8 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was spoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost that's abnormal that's that's abnormal that's not normal that's out of this before they came together how can it be that has never happened and that will never happen no one ever came that way we all have a mother and a father whether you like the parents or not but they are there they happen to be your parents whether your parent is a drunker whether it's a wish doctor whatever but that's your that's your father that's even the prophet was not very comfortable with his father he was an alcoholic he was a drinker but still that was his father and that could not be changed and so he was mysterious before they came together he was found with child of the holy ghost child of the Holy Ghost that's indeed mysterious that is strange that's a paradox no wonder why he was a mystery you can only become a mystery if you were born mysterious and unless you become a mystery you're not a Christian think about it unless you become a mystery you cannot be a Christian being an ordinary person who is understood by everybody loved by everybody well spoken of everybody if you are a real Christian you will be a strange fellow you will be an odd ball you'll be an odd person if you are going to walk with Christ you are going to be very different you are going to be just your own species your own type your own your own your own kind you will not be understood by many because you won't join up with them you will never go out with them to their parties and their worldly things you won't dress like them you won't act like them you won't even worship like them you just become so unique so you've got to be born again in a mysterious way in a miraculous way in an Immaculate way come on Amen what happened to Mary the Holy Ghost Came Upon her amen and unless the Holy Ghost comes upon you to change you and to convert you and to make you a mysterious new creature you will never make it in the kingdom is this beautiful amen this is this is wonderful here strange no wonder why he was a mystery who do men say that I the son of man but John says the revelation of Jesus Christ here is the unveiling of the mystery The Book of Revelation reveals that mystery Peter answered without hesitation and you must be able to give an answer to all that may ask you of the hope that you possess pet boldly answered Thou Art the Christ Thou Art the anointed thou are full of the Holy Ghost you are the one upon whom the Holy Ghost came like a do and abored upon amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God thou are the Messiah the anointed one the Son of God sir you see when Peter said that it was a revelation from above oh may God reveal to you him who Jesus Christ is that revelation will become the foundation of your fath when something is revealed to you the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail when something is revealed to you that Jesus Christ Is A Healer you will stand your ground and claim your heal in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know that Jesus was wounded for your transgression and by his PR you will healed you hold on until you receive your healing Hallelujah so if you are here sick tonight it's over it's finished it's already done if you have a revelation that the great physician the same yesterday today and forever is here tonight then you can receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ you can receive your blessing in the name of Jesus Christ you can receive the Holy Ghost right now not tomorrow not at the end of the service while Peter yet stay the Holy Ghost Hallelujah God hallelujah Glory the name oh Hallelujah isn't he Wonderful Tonight wonderful can someone shout hallelujah hallelujah Can someone say amen God bless you Church you owe it to God to say amen that's right because you are a priest and Priests don't sacrifice because they feel like sacrificing it's their obligation to sacrifice and you obligated praise God it's your obligation to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus and you know what Hallelujah Sometimes some of our problems don't need prayer requests Pastor please pray for me I've got housers I've got migraine headache Pastor please pray for some of these things they just need a real healthy Hallelujah Glory a real Glory Hallelujah will drive away your dece it'll drive away your sickness it'll drive away your depression and real Hallelujah will bring the walls of Jero rumbling down Hallelujah glory amen amen amen now let's look at this in Luke chapter one when Peter said Thou Art the Christ he was not just dreaming he he was not just giving an answer which had no scriptural background thou had the son of the Living God yes it was a revelation The Father revealed it but you see when the father reveals anything it's got to be scriptural right right amen you cannot just say it I've got a ration and and then when you check it with the Bible the Bible is saying one thing and your Revelation is saying another oh no you you dump that and take the word of God when Peter said Thou Art the Son of God we can check that repr with the word of God let's go to Luke chapter 1 look at this verse 35 then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man man he's answering Gabriel who had told that she was going to conceive she says I'm not married I'm a virgin how can it be seeing that I know not a man verse 35 and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost oh someone someone Rejoice someone Rejoice how is it to how will I get this job how will I overcome this how will I ever how my situation hey come on Holy Ghost Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will make a difference the Holy Ghost will make things move in your life in your church in your family in your finances in your health the Holy [Music] Ghost how can it be how can it be don't worry the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will come upon thee and the power Jes of the highest shall over Shadow thee father that's all that we need tonight that's all that we need tonight the anointing of the Holy Ghost will shake every demon of Hell the anointing of the Holy Ghost will shake the foundations of hell and will set you free Hallelujah the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee amen therefore also Hallelujah that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God so you see now Hallelujah Peter was in line yes with the scriptures he didn't just he didn't just he didn't just scream out who who Christ was just because something got revealed which was no scriptural if it's a revelation it must have a SC Foundation someone say Amen a real divine revelation is based upon the foundation of the word of God that the Christ hallu son of the Living God let's check that Revelation with the word let's go back to how Jesus was born he was born in a mysterious way Hallelujah he came in a mysterious way the angel told Mary that Holy thing that shall be B of after the Holy Ghost has come upon you Hallelujah after the power of the high overshadowed you that Holy thing shall be called The Son of God what happens to you when you receive the Holy Ghost what happens to you when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost right in your soul brother you become a another messah another anointed Hallelujah may God make us sons of God because the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God then the word became flesh and to them that received him gave him power to become what God he the Son of God you become a son you become a daughter of almighty God by the overshadowing of the holy spirit makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus amen that Holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God so when the Holy Ghost overshadows you it changes you makes you a new creature it changes your desires it changes everything about you you become a new creature you are remolded into the image of Jesus Christ and you become a Son of God yes James John tells us that beloved what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but when he shall appear we will be like him now are we the sons of God not tomorrow not at the time that he appears now right there where you are you are a son of God therefore speak like a Son of God claim your ground like a Son of God Amen give me my Mountain give me this mountain give me this blessing you are a son of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to God so here it is friends when Peter by Revelation unveiled the mystery of who Jesus was and proclaimed boldly Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you know what Peter did right there he struck the nerve center of the new birth amen yeah he struck it right there right there if he was the person who is looking for water and trying to to r a b hole he would have really struck the real real real stream underneath there thou are the Christ son of the Living God this question was answered right there Beyond any Shadow of Doubt this resolv the issue of why Jesus was such a mysterious person amen if he was a Son of God for sure he was a mysterious person he was the son of the Living God by a mysterious birth and when that Revelation strikes that's the new birth which makes the believer a mysterious amen they will never understand you the same Revelations if it strikes you it makes you a mysterious yes person that's right now let's go to John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him ver verily I say unto thee except a man be born again you see now we go back to the birth that's what made Jesus mysterious the way he was born and the way you are born if you are born by Church joining you will not make it as a Believer go ahead now if you are born by just from the P you never make it if you were born because you were born in the message you hear if you are born because you were born in the message and you say I am a believer I'm an eego because I'm I'm a child of a pastor I'm a child of a brother I'm a child of a Deon I'm a child of that doesn't make you a Believer you may be born in the church when you are way out of the Kingdom yeah but until you are born mysterious Immaculate Conception by the power of the Holy Ghost I feel the anointing I feel religious right now to be honest with you I feel religious right now Hallelujah I could tud the spirit right now Hallelujah until the Holy Ghost comes upon you overshadows you heals you changes you mold makes you a new creature that has to happen hallelu in Immaculate Conception of the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes you a mysterious person then all your life is changed your friends are changed the way you do things changes your behavior changes somebody help me tonight the way you dress Chang the way you talk shange amen the way you conduct your business Hallelujah and the way you believe Chang your work CH you become a new creature people will have a hard time un sending you Hallelujah and you can also say to them who do you say I am GL what think you of me okay let's go to verse 8 verse 8 of John 3 the wind bloweth there you are you become a Myster where it list and thou hearest the sound but can not tell whence it cometh and where it goeth so is everyone that is Bor of the spirit that's why they could never figure out who Jesus was he remains a mystery they tried to figure out could he be J Baptist no no could he be Jeremiah there was still something and there's something about a believer that will remain a mystery to the world amen amen except a man has the Revelation hallu this is what we say from the scriptures here except a man has the revelation of who Christ is he is out of the Kingdom Simon became a new creature the moment he said Thou Art the Christ Jesus says Thou Art Peter I like that sir Thou Art the Christ Thou Art Peter am you tell him who he is he tells you who you are amen that's right that's right that's right you get a revelation of who he is and he reveals you your position thou the Christ yeah thou Peter amen amen you are that that head of that church there I'll give you the keys and brother if you know who he is and you get that Revelation you are given the same Keys God cannot be a respector of person if he gave Peter the keys to unlock whatever he wants to whatever he want to sh whoever will get the same revelation will get the same blessing and I'm saying today if you have a revelation of who Jesus Christ is the keys are in your hands amen what you don't want lock it out of your life and what you want unlock the window that come right down into your let me allow me to read something here from the prophet of this generation the Christ is the mystery of God revealed what is the new birth then well you would say brother PR what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you hey am men not you joined the church or you shook a hand or you done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a Cod of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you Lord and no matter what anybody say what takes place is Christ amen past priest whatever it might be it's Christ in that is the revelation that the church was built upon 240 the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew his position it will one day then the will go he knows oh may God hasten the time may God hasten the time that we know who we are hallelujah amen as many as have Reed him power to become the sons of let's just look a little bit more here on how mysterious Jesus was in what he would say the way that he lived can you imagine a man of his caliber saying foxes [Music] have birds of the but the man has nowhere to lay his that's mysterious how can he fail to have a place to stay when he could walk on the water when he could multiply loaves of then he says I nowhere to lay my hand he would just sleep wherever the Sun said if the sun set while he was in the mountain he slept there if the son set while he was he was at Peter's home he slept there wherever he was that was his home for that day yet he was God in flesh he was the creator he could have spoken a house into existence wherever he was and speak it into existence and the meeting is over give it to a brother am amen he have done it he are possible but he was such aerious person you know when you know what life really is you care about things that matter you just care about things that really matters right you don't worry about all these other things when you know but anyway look how let's just take it in Matthew 13 Matthew 13343 Matthew 1334 and 35 all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parable our out things which have never which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world he spoken you just like I mean in in U in Mysteries just like me here speaking to some of you cannot really understand follow my accent because it is it is shaliz there interference of the mother tongue and amen you know I had one time some visitors that came to our home brother brother one American Brothers we visited and so we were sitting at the table my wife prepared such a beautiful meal and so he said to Joseph can I please have some water I said what he said can I please have some water I said uh I don't hear what you are saying I don't understand what is water what is water he says water water you mean water I said we say water here we say water he says well brother John I didn't you preacher in the Pastor said yes I am said say what the tape says I said okay brother from today on I don't want to hear you everything saying we are living in an adulterous generation cuz the tpe says adulteress Mysteries Mysteries Jesus spoke nothing plain he just spoken mystery but those that were obained to that's right they heard him and if you have the Holy Ghost in you the Holy Ghost will anoint my AC and you will understand everything of what I'm trying to say to you amen let's go on to John 3 there John 3 John 3:13 just look at it look how strange Jesus was John 3:13 and no man have ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven people who are listening hearing the son of man which came down from heaven which is even now in heaven that he was standing right there he spoke in par John 633 for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world John 6: 41:42 the Jews then memor him because he said I am the pr bread which came down from heaven and they said is this not Jo Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he says I came down from heaven it was a mystery he was a mystery verse 51 of John 6 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world he kept on it mystery upon mystery on verse 52 the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat let's go to John 7 verse 12 listen to this and there was much meming among the people concerning him some say he's a good man others n but he deceive the people wasn't there much memory about brother BR yeah among the religious circles they were so astounded so astonished by his gift and they wanted even their that gift to be to be to be to be done in their churches so that they would fill up their their pews but when he started to open his mouth and start to explain things there was much murmuring yeah M there was much memory among the people concerning him he was a mystery John 7 the same chapter on verse 15 and the Jews marveled saying how knoweth this man letters have never learned if you read further he says my Doctrine is not of men it is from above am and Peter when he says Thou Art it was not his Doctrine it was from above God revealed it to him amen so because he was a mystery you know what because he was a mystery he caused a division among the people sure what he did he caused a division among the people and he said it in Luke 12 on verse 51 suppose he that I am come to give peace on Earth I tell you nay but rather division then in John 7: 43 let's see what these people said after he had spoken to them so there was a division among the people because of him and I want you to know today he's the same [Music] yesterday forever there will be a division if you have him in you you better prepare for that division you're going to walk alone you are not going to keep on walking with isau if you are Jacob going to come a separation and division let's go to chapter 9 John verse 16 John 9:16 therefore said some of the Pharisees this man is not of God because he keepeth not the Sabbath day and that said how can a man that is a sinner do such Miracles and there was a division this is beautiful was Aion you know when God said let there be light there wasn't right Darkness one corner and when you are born again there will be a division there was a division among them let's go to John chapter 10 watch it I came on verse 19 you will enjoy reading the verses before what I've have just taken here because of time I couldn't read the whole text will take us too long so on verse 19 of John chapter 10 there was a division that's the third timeing therefore I again among the Jews for this saying and many of them said he is a devil he is mad why he he him at the these are not the words of him that had the devil can a devil Open the Eyes of the blind oh my even the Pentecostal head to say yeah we know Bram was a man of God but you his followers you have got you are the problem okay there was a division why was there a division of M listen to this because he was a mystery amen a mystery always causes division unless there is a revelation that is why today we have so many denomination Hallelujah and division among the Christian church and even among us there are division yes sir because of mysterious things in the Bible amen the doctrine of the serpent seed is a mystery no one really knows what happened in Genesis the Bible did not say it Point Blank it just said she had the Forbidden free and because of that there is division among the people amen some say it was an apple some say no it wasn't an apple you say a mystery always causes division some say there are three gods and the godhead is a mystery it has caused division in the Christian church what a baptism Jesus said go baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost but Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus there is a division among the people because it's a miss and unless you have a revelation hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God unless you have a revelation a mystery will divide [Music] you have the seven Thunders Wow Wow Wow wowow have theyed or have they not yet why it will cause a division it will div it's a mystery but if you have a revelation offering or thank you amen brings you together why are we enjoying the word like this some of you have never seen me some of you have heard about me maybe heard about me negatively but when you hear me now oh but he's a good man Hallelujah why are we enjoying the word like this fellowshipping because we have the same Revelation you can say Amen to a man you have never seen heard him PR but because he is saying what you know what's been revealed to you we can he Fellowship Hallelujah we can shout hallelujah we can enjoy fell we can enjoy the word because we are standing on the same platform we are in Heavenly plac in Christ Jesus for by one Spirit are we all bapti into one bright body Hallelujah glory to God this is beautiful hallelujah oh you are you are a very good audience glory to God you are a very good audience amen Mysteries always divide amen but that must come to an end yes sir because we have a promise that's right Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the Seven Angels but he shall begin to sound the mystery of God will be Hallelujah and when the mystery of God is finished when the revelation of Jesus Christ comes it unites the true Bri in pration for the [Applause] LT praise the Lord wow who do men say that Hallelujah allow me to call from Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 303 Watch God's Great Revelation unfold by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much division Among Us is because the people lack that Revelation see they lack that Revelation that teachers may God help us to teach the right Revelation that's right so even don't to speak mysteriously because as I said he was a mystery himself let's see what he said in John 2: 19 destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up what is it talking about let's go to John 11:25 I am the resurrection how can person be the resurrection how can an individual be the resurrection I mean the resurrection is someone who's dead rising up but he's saying I am the resurrection you know what and on the same basis we can say tonight we are the Rapture why we possess that seed we have the Revelation that we shall not die but we shall be changed in a moment in the quick this Mortal will put on immortality so we can actually say we are the rupt yes he said he was in John chapter 10 quickly John chapter 10 17 and 18 therefore do my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again [Music] 18 no man taketh it from me but I lay down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again his commandment have I received of my father indeed he was in mystery and no man ever spoke like him because no man was born like him in John 474 46 John 746 the officers answered because the Pharisees had sent some people to go take him and bring him but when they heard him speak hey when they heard him speak they were just powerless they lost all their power I remember when we first repented and we left the Methodist Church and the scripture Union movements and things like that and then people were being warned against us it by the denomination where we had laugh and they say never you give those people a chance to speak to you because they will just confuse you about the scriptures don't let them open the Bible he said wow how can a preacher say don't let someone open the Bible what what is he talking what is he giving to the people the Bible says there and no never men John 7:46 never man spake like this man verse 53 and every man went on to his own house what a conclusion what a conclusion they couldn't go to each other's house to fellow or talk about what each man went to his own house this is this is I don't know about this I don't know I don't know about this every man went to his own outside trust when the service is over won't do this let's have some fellowship yes amen John chapter 8 verse 56- 58 your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad imagine people hearing that Abraham saw your day really you the son of Joseph Abraham so your day you know if you put yourself in in the place of those who were healing be careful you might have taken how can it be so it says there on verse 57 then said the Jews unto him Thou Art not yet 50 years old and thou seen Abraham then Jesus G bomb them you before Abraham was I am wow this man the way he spoke go to man say I am and then John 10:30 I and my father one John 14:9 Jesus said unto him have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he that had seen me seen the father th sayest thou then show us the father he was a mysterious person he was a mystery being Supernatural made him mysterious but we thank God this is the revelation of Jesus Christ cleopas and your friend on the way to a mou who do you say that I am so he appeared and kept hiding his nail scared hands away from him and as they were talking miserably in Luke 24:1 15-17 it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with him but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said un them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad amen if you are sad what have you been talking about I'm serious if you are sad what have you been talking about you were not talking about Jesus

the doctor's report don't talk about your miserable condition don't talk about your weaknesses don't talk about your Fai let the weak say I am let the poor say I'm what manner of community on verse 25 of Luke 24 then he said unto them all fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory what is he doing he now revealing himself to them and beginning and Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself he revealed himself to them and their hearts were burning and their hearts were burning but still their eyes were closed but in the evening time it shall be light in the evening time at the setting of the sun on Sunset Mountain the revelation of Jesus will come even in the cloud to the very face amen of Jesus there it is he revealed himself let me wind this to your cloes and say when I say to your clo I don't mean the next minute please
