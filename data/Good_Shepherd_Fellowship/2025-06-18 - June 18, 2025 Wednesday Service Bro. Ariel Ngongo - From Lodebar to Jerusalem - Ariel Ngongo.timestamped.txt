[10:58] Going to be in the house of the Lord
[10:59] tonight.
[11:09] Let's just uh take our Bibles and uh we
[11:13] will read u here just before we go into
[11:17] our prayer needs.
[11:22] It's good to see uh the grace of God in
[11:25] your faces
[11:29] and uh
[11:46] let's read uh uh Psalm chapter 68. 8.
[11:52] Psalm chapter 68 uh we read uh from
[11:56] verse one
[11:58] and uh
[12:05] let the Lord arise. Let his enemy be
[12:08] scattered. Let them also that hit him
[12:11] flee before him. As smoke is driven
[12:14] away, so drive them away. as wax melt
[12:18] melted before the fire. So let the
[12:21] wicked perish at the presence of God.
[12:25] But let the righteous be glad. Let them
[12:27] rejoice before God. Yeah. Let them
[12:30] exceedingly rejoice.
[12:33] Sing unto God. Sing praises to his name.
[12:37] Extol him that ratted upon the heaven by
[12:41] his name J. And rejoice before him.
[12:46] A father of the fatherless and a George
[12:50] of the widows is God in his holy
[12:54] habitation.
[12:55] Amen.
[12:57] Amen. Let's just bow our heads tonight
[12:59] and you can have your seat and uh
[13:03] uh whichever way you want to position
[13:05] yourself for prayer tonight. But uh uh
[13:09] let's just uh

[13:40] While our sister softly played, I want
[13:42] to just read few prayer needs and and
[13:45] praise report.
[13:47] There's a praise report that came out of

[51:44] May God bless you.
[51:46] You're happy to be in the house of the
[51:47] Lord.
[51:49] Oh my. I I need you to pray for me. I
[51:51] need help this this evening that the
[51:54] Lord will be able to help us. Uh so not
[51:57] to keep you too long, I will invite you
[51:59] to open the Bible with me in the book of
[52:01] 2 Samuel,
[52:03] 2 Samuel chapter 4.
[52:08] We want to appreciate brother one for
[52:11] allowing us to to be once again here and
[52:14] just to fellowship around the word of
[52:16] God.
[52:18] Just trust that uh something will be
[52:21] said tonight will be of a blessing.
[52:25] Um the reason why I feel a little
[52:26] nervous because you know you know when
[52:29] sometime you pray you just wait for the
[52:31] Lord and and you know you you're waiting
[52:34] for a sign and he's just leading you to
[52:36] a subject that you're not really ready
[52:37] to speak on but yet you have to trust
[52:40] him just the way it is. I I I don't know
[52:42] maybe somebody has a desire tonight that
[52:45] you know uh I just trust that he would
[52:48] take control of everything.
[52:50] 2 Samuel chapter 4.
[52:54] Uh we'll start with uh the the first
[52:59] verse.
[53:03] If the sister can help us projecting the
[53:05] scriptures, that'll be helpful.
[53:09] 2 Samuel 4:1 the Bible says,
[53:13] "And when
[53:15] when Saul's son heard that Abna was dead
[53:20] in uh in in Abram, his hand were feeble,
[53:24] and all Israel were troubled.
[53:28] And Saul's son had two men that were
[53:31] captain of the band. The name of the one
[53:35] was Benna, and the name of the other Ra,
[53:40] the son of Raymon, the Bethroite
[53:44] of the children of Benjamin.
[53:46] For Baroth also was reckoned to
[53:50] Benjamin.
[53:52] And the Barotite fled to Guillotan where
[53:56] surgeon and were surgeon surgeon sorry
[54:01] there until this day. Now I want you to
[54:03] pay attention on verse four. The Bible
[54:05] says, "And Jonathan saw son had a son
[54:11] that was laying in of his feet. He was 5
[54:15] years old when the tidings came of Saul
[54:20] and Jonathan out of Jezrael.
[54:23] And his nurse took him up and fled. And
[54:27] it came to pass as she made hers to flee
[54:31] that he fell and became lame. His name
[54:35] was Mphibicheth.
[54:38] I will invite you also to read in the
[54:39] book of Roman chapter 8 verse 28.
[54:45] Roman chapter 8 verse 28.
[54:52] It's a very familiar scriptures.
[54:55] Now the Bible says and we know that all
[54:59] thing you know that just says some
[55:02] things. It says all things work together
[55:07] to them that love God to them who are
[55:11] called
[55:13] according to his purpose.
[55:16] Now we will stop there. You may be
[55:17] seated.
[55:20] How many of us are happy to be in the
[55:21] house of the Lord?
[55:23] As I always believe, we only receive
[55:26] what we expect. How many of us expecting
[55:29] something tonight?
[55:31] You know, God is faithful in his word.
[55:33] He's faithful the way he does things.
[55:36] And every time that we come to his
[55:38] house, we coming with expectation,
[55:41] you know. And uh uh before I even go
[55:44] further, I just want to thank the Lord.
[55:46] And tomorrow will be my birthday. So I
[55:48] just trust that his grace will be able
[55:50] to keep us again.
[55:52] Now I have a thought here that I want to
[55:55] speak on from Lordar to Jerusalem. That
[55:59] would be my title. From Lordar to
[56:03] Jerusale to Jerusalem.
[56:06] Now uh I want to read the first quote
[56:09] that I have here. Unveiling of God. The
[56:12] prophet says something here. It says
[56:15] every see every parable in the Bible,
[56:19] every type of the Bible is made manifest
[56:24] right here before us. How many of us
[56:26] believe that? Now, it says the same God
[56:29] in the pillar of fire that wrote the
[56:32] Bible, both the Old
[56:35] and the New Testament is right here
[56:38] manifesting it. How many of us believe
[56:40] that?
[56:42] showing just exactly what it was
[56:46] interpreting right back and to make it
[56:49] sure that it's the interpretation.
[56:53] So last time that we spoke we spoke
[56:56] about call by name. How many of us
[56:58] enjoyed the word last time? You know
[57:01] it's just to let us know that our name
[57:03] was written before the foundation of the
[57:06] world. You know it's not something that
[57:08] we have done but it's because of his
[57:11] grace and his mercy. You know sometime
[57:14] we think if I do good God will accept me
[57:16] because I have done good. You know
[57:19] that's not the Bible. God knows the end
[57:22] before the beginning. He knows every
[57:24] decision that we made under the earth.
[57:26] He knows your alpha. He knows your
[57:28] omega. How many of us believe that?
[57:30] Amen. So as we are living, we must just
[57:33] trust in him because he knows
[57:36] everything. He has our life under
[57:38] control. But for tonight, I want to just
[57:41] look into the life of this man called
[57:44] Meibushef. How many of us know me?
[57:48] Now if you watch this story here,
[57:51] because God is hidden in types and
[57:54] shadow. We spoke about it last time. So
[57:56] when you're reading the Old Testament,
[57:58] there are many things that are there
[58:00] that speaks of Jesus Christ. His name
[58:03] may not even be mentioned, but it speaks
[58:06] of him. And also the whole plan of
[58:09] redemption is hidden in the Bible. And
[58:12] it's not just about God alone. He
[58:14] involve also you. That's why when you
[58:16] read your Bible, you can feel a certain
[58:18] connection. You know you might be
[58:20] dealing with a situation when you open
[58:22] the Bible here below you you notice that
[58:24] there's a scripture there that speaks of
[58:26] you or that speaks of your your
[58:28] situation. So it means that but the
[58:30] Bible itself is a book that has a hidden
[58:34] parts has a secret that is pertaining to
[58:36] your life. Do you believe this? But for
[58:39] tonight I want to look into the life of
[58:41] meth and I'm sure that you will see your
[58:44] life through that his life for some
[58:46] reason here. Just just bear with me for
[58:47] a minute here. Now if you notice
[58:50] Mphibosf was just five years old uh when
[58:54] the news came to him the tidings that
[58:57] Saul and Jonathan's death came from the
[59:01] battle you know they were coming from a
[59:03] battle and they died right at Gib Giba
[59:07] and you would notice that his nurse
[59:10] because at the time you know if you are
[59:13] part of the you know the the royal
[59:15] lineage of the king if anything happened
[59:17] to your father, right? Or your
[59:19] grandfather, your life is in jeopardy.
[59:21] Do you notice that? But now his nurse
[59:24] heard the death or the tidings, the news
[59:27] that came around that Jonathan and Saul
[59:30] died and the nurse took the little baby
[59:32] really quick and said, "Wow, I mean this
[59:34] one is the hairs of the king of the
[59:36] kingdom." So she took she took the
[59:39] little child and with the right
[59:40] intention to run and hide the child. Are
[59:43] you are you seeing what I'm saying?
[59:44] Amen. So now and while she was trying to
[59:47] take the child and to take care of the
[59:49] child to run away with the child, the
[59:51] little child of 5 years old failed. What
[59:54] a a sad story. What a tra a tragedy. Do
[59:58] you believe that? You know, and you
[1:00:01] would notice that fearing of of his
[1:00:04] life, you know, you know, she kept the
[1:00:06] child and flew away with with with him.
[1:00:09] Now, the announcement, just the events
[1:00:12] that happened, the death of Saul and
[1:00:15] Jonathan brought a new chapter in the
[1:00:18] life of this little boy. Are you with
[1:00:21] me? Can you just imagine? You know, he's
[1:00:24] 5 years old. He's living in the palace
[1:00:26] and he wakes up in the morning. He hears
[1:00:28] the news. Of course, he's only five. He
[1:00:32] doesn't even know know anything. Yeah.
[1:00:34] But he hears that there's there's
[1:00:36] something that happened. You know, his
[1:00:38] maid rush and takes him and and run run
[1:00:40] with him and he will wonder what what is
[1:00:43] happening. And the next minute you
[1:00:45] notice that the child falls on the
[1:00:47] ground. And he breaks both of his leg.
[1:00:50] He can't even walk anymore. Can you just
[1:00:53] imagine this? Yeah.
[1:00:56] The announcement just the announcement
[1:00:58] and all these events that are happening
[1:01:00] rapidly
[1:01:02] directly had an impact in the life of
[1:01:04] the little boy physically maybe
[1:01:08] emotionally psychologically. Are you
[1:01:11] with me? And he does not understand what
[1:01:14] has just happened. Yeah. He hears the
[1:01:17] bad news and the next minutes he falls
[1:01:20] on the ground and he can't walk. He
[1:01:21] becomes lame. Yeah.
[1:01:24] That reminds me of a story of the Bible
[1:01:27] in Eden
[1:01:29] is because of a woman that sin enter
[1:01:31] into the garden of Eden. How many of us
[1:01:33] believe that?
[1:01:36] Because of reason.
[1:01:39] She was reasoning with the word and she
[1:01:41] fell and the whole human race fell in
[1:01:43] sin.
[1:01:46] But you would wonder what had happened.
[1:01:49] Did she really desire to fall?
[1:01:52] No. Did the little child me desire or
[1:01:56] even thought that it will happen in his
[1:01:58] life that he will fall?
[1:02:00] Say, let me just stop a little bit here.
[1:02:03] That has to do also with our own life.
[1:02:08] If you pay attention, there are things
[1:02:10] that happen in our life. Sometime we
[1:02:12] don't know how did it how did we get
[1:02:14] there. How many of us believe that? Yes.
[1:02:18] If we can be tonight, I will I will try
[1:02:19] just to, you know, so that we can stop
[1:02:21] and take time a little bit. Is that
[1:02:22] right? Just to think a little bit about
[1:02:24] our life.
[1:02:26] Every single one of us are dealing with
[1:02:28] a situation that we don't even know what
[1:02:31] we what have we done wrong.
[1:02:34] Sometimes something happened, you ask
[1:02:36] yourself, did did I sin?
[1:02:41] Did my parents sin? Did I do something
[1:02:43] wrong?
[1:02:45] You go on your knees, you pray, say,
[1:02:46] "God, please forgive me. You know, you
[1:02:48] know my my mind. I never intended to
[1:02:50] sin.
[1:02:52] Oh, I I didn't even plan to do this, but
[1:02:55] it happens." It's the same situation
[1:02:58] with me.
[1:03:00] Just a little boy not even thinking
[1:03:02] about it and it happened. The same thing
[1:03:05] in the Garden of Eden. Can you imagine a
[1:03:07] little boy you just born or a little
[1:03:09] girl you born and automatically
[1:03:11] everything that from your parents are
[1:03:13] already attached to your your your your
[1:03:14] flesh?
[1:03:16] Are you with me? Yeah. You have not done
[1:03:18] anything wrong yet. You have not even
[1:03:21] made a wrong choice yet. You don't teach
[1:03:23] a little child how to lie.
[1:03:26] It comes automatically. The child begins
[1:03:28] to lie.
[1:03:31] You never taugh a child how to to have
[1:03:34] temper. It's automatically you you have
[1:03:36] a child is already dealing with temper
[1:03:40] because as we spoke last time the human
[1:03:42] nature is already corrupted
[1:03:45] because of one woman Eve that disbelieve
[1:03:49] God's word but you know in all things
[1:03:53] God has a purpose
[1:03:56] you know knowing God's purpose keeps you
[1:03:59] stable in life
[1:04:01] as a son and a daughter of God you know
[1:04:04] that all things work for good. At the
[1:04:07] moment when you're dealing with that
[1:04:09] situation, it may not seems to be good
[1:04:11] if we can be honest.
[1:04:14] You're dealing with a situation that you
[1:04:16] wanted to say, Lord, I don't understand
[1:04:18] how this thing happened. But the word of
[1:04:21] God comes to bring you to that place to
[1:04:23] realize first of all, I'm a son of God.
[1:04:25] I'm a daughter of God. And everything
[1:04:28] that is happening in my life, there is a
[1:04:30] purpose behind it. I may not know it at
[1:04:33] that point, but God would show me later
[1:04:36] on what he's about to do. Amen.
[1:04:40] Are you with me? I will give you another
[1:04:43] example. Look for example, Job.
[1:04:47] Job was a righteous man. He was a good
[1:04:49] man.
[1:04:51] What makes him righteous? Because he
[1:04:52] follow God's way to kill the animal, to
[1:04:55] sacrifice the animal. There is nothing
[1:04:58] wrong. If he's seen for instance, he
[1:05:00] will go and take a lamb and cut the
[1:05:02] throat by revelation. We talk about
[1:05:04] revelation. He knew the whole process.
[1:05:07] But one day he wakes up in the morning.
[1:05:10] He hears that, "Oh wow, we heard over
[1:05:12] there your children died and this
[1:05:14] happened to you. The cattle got burned
[1:05:16] and he wonder what what did I do wrong?"
[1:05:20] But behind the scene, there was a
[1:05:23] conversation between God and Satan that
[1:05:25] Job did not know about. Amen. You see,
[1:05:29] God had a purpose in the life of Job.
[1:05:32] Amen. So, all things work for good to
[1:05:35] those that love the Lord. That's right.
[1:05:37] Job was a righteous man before God.
[1:05:40] Amen. Even God was bragging about him.
[1:05:44] That's right. Amen. Amen. He was
[1:05:46] bragging. Oh my goodness. And even Satan
[1:05:49] said, "Have you seen my servant Job?"
[1:05:52] Yes. But Job did not know it. He was a
[1:05:55] man or a woman. He was a normal man like
[1:05:57] you and I.
[1:06:00] He had mistakes. He had his ups and
[1:06:02] down.
[1:06:05] But saints, when we look at life, the
[1:06:08] reality of life, we need to apply our
[1:06:10] life with the word. Amen. If we are
[1:06:12] sitting here, it's because somehow we
[1:06:15] have heard the voice of God.
[1:06:17] And the voice of God is having an
[1:06:19] influence in our life to realize that
[1:06:21] God, you have a purpose in my life. Are
[1:06:23] you with me? Amen. Amen. Mhm. Oh my.
[1:06:27] Amen.
[1:06:29] God said all things work for good to
[1:06:32] them. I want to read a scripture here in
[1:06:34] the book of Jeremiah chapter 29.
[1:06:37] God God speak Jeremiah is saying here
[1:06:40] for God is speaking through Jeremiah
[1:06:42] says I know the thoughts that I think
[1:06:44] toward you says the Lord thought of
[1:06:47] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:06:50] expected end.
[1:06:52] Amen. This is the thought of God
[1:06:54] concerning you. Amen. This is not even
[1:06:58] your own thoughts.
[1:07:01] You You're not thinking right.
[1:07:05] God is thinking. He says, "You know
[1:07:07] what? I have a purpose for this child,
[1:07:09] for this daughter. I'm going to bring
[1:07:11] her where I want her to be." But your
[1:07:14] thought, you not even thinking because
[1:07:15] you don't even know.
[1:07:17] But God's purpose will always prevail.
[1:07:20] Amen. Even when your own abilities when
[1:07:24] you can't even do it by your own, God
[1:07:26] has already planned that it would
[1:07:28] happen. Amen. Amen. That's why saints
[1:07:32] when things when somebody somebody hurts
[1:07:34] us in the way of another, we should not
[1:07:36] blame them.
[1:07:38] If you are a son and a daughter of God,
[1:07:40] you should not blame your neighbor.
[1:07:42] Sure. Right. Because God as a it
[1:07:44] position in you even if it looks
[1:07:46] negative, but God has a purpose. Amen.
[1:07:49] That's right. Amen. So if something
[1:07:52] happen among us, it should stabil
[1:07:54] stabilize us as Christians. Amen. We
[1:07:56] believe that all things happen for good.
[1:07:59] I may not understand it now, but God has
[1:08:01] a purpose. That's right. Are you with
[1:08:04] me? Amen. Now open the open the Bible
[1:08:06] with me please in second 2 Samuel
[1:08:09] chapter 9 verse one.
[1:08:12] You know I will read a little bit the
[1:08:13] Bible so that we can you know somebody
[1:08:15] will catch something out of this the
[1:08:17] scriptures. Amen. I I think I'm
[1:08:19] approaching a little differently
[1:08:20] tonight, but I I just pray that this
[1:08:22] will be a blessing to someone. Amen. Are
[1:08:24] you with me? And David says,
[1:08:28] "Is there any that's after the death of
[1:08:33] Jonathan and and and and
[1:08:36] so his father? Is that right?" And David
[1:08:39] says, "Is there yet any that is left of
[1:08:44] the house of Saul that I may show him
[1:08:47] kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
[1:08:51] Are you with me? How many of us how
[1:08:54] knows how Saul was seeking to kill
[1:08:56] David? How many of us know that? But
[1:08:58] there was a relationship between David
[1:09:01] and Jonathan. Are you with me? Amen. Now
[1:09:06] sometime the good work of the parents
[1:09:08] follow the children. You know that
[1:09:12] I just had to throw it that you know the
[1:09:15] Bible says Jonathan loved David as his
[1:09:18] lo as he loved his own soul. That's
[1:09:22] right. Can you imagine
[1:09:25] Jonathan seeing his father going against
[1:09:28] David? But by revelation, Jonathan could
[1:09:32] see Dave as his brother. He says, "No,
[1:09:34] this guy will be king." Yeah. He has the
[1:09:38] nature of the king's anointed to be
[1:09:40] king.
[1:09:42] When nobody will see anything but
[1:09:44] Jonathan has had the revelation.
[1:09:47] Can you imagine that's your father in
[1:09:49] the throne?
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:52] But Jonathan said, "I do believe in
[1:09:54] David. David, you are a king. There is
[1:09:57] something special about you in your life
[1:09:59] on your life.
[1:10:01] Are you with me?
[1:10:03] Oh my. He had a clear provision of David
[1:10:08] coming to power.
[1:10:10] Oh greatness. No jealousy whatsoever.
[1:10:14] You know sometime we have a lot of
[1:10:17] spirit of jealousy.
[1:10:19] We come to church you know we still have
[1:10:21] jealousy against our neighbor.
[1:10:24] You know Cain and and and and Abel
[1:10:28] jealousy was at the altar. It was at a
[1:10:30] place a gathering where people were
[1:10:32] coming to worship.
[1:10:34] So you cannot say if we come to church
[1:10:36] then nobody has jealousy. We still we
[1:10:38] still have to deal with that. That's
[1:10:39] right. There are people that are coming
[1:10:40] to church with jealousy.
[1:10:43] Your prayer cannot be answered.
[1:10:47] Hallelujah. Our prayer cannot be
[1:10:48] answered with the spirit of jealousy in
[1:10:50] our heart.
[1:10:52] When we come into the altar, we must die
[1:10:54] to that spirit.
[1:10:56] Are you with me?
[1:10:59] Oh my.
[1:11:01] That's an example of a good friendship.
[1:11:05] That was his dad. That was his
[1:11:06] biological father. But he was willing to
[1:11:09] to forsake his own family.
[1:11:14] He was willing to forsake his own family
[1:11:16] for the purp for the revelation that he
[1:11:19] has received. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:24] Oh my. And he knew that David was
[1:11:28] innocent when his father was following
[1:11:31] him.
[1:11:32] Hallelujah. Because he tried David many
[1:11:35] time.
[1:11:37] He knew that he was innocent. Let me
[1:11:40] just stop a little bit here. You don't
[1:11:42] have to prove to everybody that you're
[1:11:43] innocent. That's right. There are
[1:11:45] somebody that is watching you who know
[1:11:47] that you are innocent. At least God will
[1:11:50] have one witness.
[1:11:52] Amen. You know the truth is so stubborn.
[1:11:56] Hallelujah. The truth is stubborn. If
[1:12:00] you are living right, you don't have to
[1:12:02] argue. You don't have to prove anything.
[1:12:05] You just stay there and wait. Even if
[1:12:08] there were hatred sin against you, stand
[1:12:10] alone. Praise the Lord. Amen. Stand
[1:12:15] alone.
[1:12:16] Amen. The truth is stubborn. You know,
[1:12:20] my my dad usually use a statement. He
[1:12:22] says, "A lie takes the elevator and gets
[1:12:26] there first." He says, "But the truth
[1:12:29] takes the stairs."
[1:12:32] Do you understand that concept? Yes. It
[1:12:34] takes time, but the truth will come out
[1:12:36] eventually.
[1:12:38] Hallelujah.
[1:12:41] Glory be to God.
[1:12:43] David had a revelation
[1:12:46] that sorry, Jonathan had a revelation
[1:12:49] that David was anointed to be king.
[1:12:51] Amen. Let's continue the reading here.
[1:12:55] Oh my. David here is seeking, right? The
[1:12:59] the the the uh I think that was verse
[1:13:02] one. David is still seeking to reward
[1:13:06] the descendant
[1:13:08] of Saul.
[1:13:10] In other word, he was looking at the
[1:13:12] covenant that he made with Jonathan. Are
[1:13:15] you are you with me? Amen. Amen.
[1:13:19] The the Bible is is beautiful. Verse
[1:13:22] two. And there was of the house of Saul
[1:13:25] a a servant whose name was Zeba. Are you
[1:13:29] with me? And when they had called him
[1:13:32] unto David, the king said unto him, thou
[1:13:35] Zeba, it says, he says, that servant is
[1:13:38] he? And the king said, Is there yet any
[1:13:43] of the house of Saul that that I may
[1:13:46] show kindness of God unto him? And Zeba
[1:13:51] said unto the king, Jonathan had yet a
[1:13:54] son, which is lame on his feet.
[1:14:00] You know, the Bible does not just put
[1:14:02] words like this.
[1:14:05] It makes it emphasizes on things that
[1:14:07] you need to pay attention. Why would he
[1:14:10] mention that specifically? Amen. Amen.
[1:14:14] Amen. You know sometime in our own life
[1:14:16] we are lame of something. Yes. It can be
[1:14:20] a habit.
[1:14:22] It can be something that has been
[1:14:24] lingering in our life for so long.
[1:14:26] That's right. That we want to we need to
[1:14:29] get rid of it. That's right. Because
[1:14:31] saints, this house is a house of
[1:14:33] judgment. You don't have to wait for
[1:14:35] judgment. This is the time that I need
[1:14:38] to get all the judgment as possible. I
[1:14:40] don't want to have a problem at the
[1:14:42] river.
[1:14:45] Are you with me? I don't want to have a
[1:14:47] problem at a river.
[1:14:50] When all my spirit and my body shuts
[1:14:52] down, I cannot make things right. And
[1:14:54] once I have an opportunity to speak, I
[1:14:56] must make things right.
[1:14:59] Amen. Amen. Amen. May God help us.
[1:15:06] Oh my. Things are mentioned.
[1:15:10] This child is broken. He can't walk.
[1:15:14] is something that seems to be negative,
[1:15:17] right? But yet he has to be mentioned.
[1:15:22] Are you with me? Amen. Verse four. And
[1:15:25] the king said unto him, where is he?
[1:15:29] And Zeba said unto the king, behold, he
[1:15:33] is in the house of Mashia, the son of Am
[1:15:38] in Labore.
[1:15:40] Are you with me? Right. My title here is
[1:15:42] from Labar to Jerusalem. Okay. Thank
[1:15:46] you, Lord. All right. I want you just to
[1:15:48] catch this for a minute here.
[1:15:51] Now, after the death of soul, that
[1:15:55] little child had lost everything. Are
[1:15:57] you with me? Right. Now, even the
[1:16:00] lineage of descendant of the the it
[1:16:03] couldn't be even if it was a heir. It
[1:16:05] was a a son of a king. Yeah. That was in
[1:16:07] his gene, right? But at that moment it
[1:16:11] was nothing. He lost every privileges.
[1:16:14] The same way when Eve fell in the garden
[1:16:16] of Eden and Adam they lost everything.
[1:16:20] The prophet will say that the title deed
[1:16:23] went back to the original owner. They
[1:16:26] lost everything.
[1:16:29] For the matter of fact they were
[1:16:31] forbidden to touch of the tree of life.
[1:16:34] They were separated from the tree of
[1:16:36] life. Amen.
[1:16:38] Hallelujah.
[1:16:41] Now for you to receive something grace
[1:16:43] of God, you have to acknowledge from
[1:16:45] where you have fallen first. Amen. You
[1:16:48] know many of us are born in a message
[1:16:51] with so holy
[1:16:53] that we don't know what the grace of God
[1:16:54] means.
[1:16:57] You give me somebody that was stuck in
[1:17:00] drugs and drinking alcohol being
[1:17:01] delivered. When God touches their heart,
[1:17:05] they know exactly what the grace of God
[1:17:07] means.
[1:17:08] Amen. Amen. If you have not done
[1:17:10] anything, and I'm not advising somebody
[1:17:12] to do something. I'm just saying that if
[1:17:15] you have done some something wrong, the
[1:17:18] judge is standing there. It says, you
[1:17:20] know, I'm ready to judge you.
[1:17:24] But yet the same judge, he becomes your
[1:17:27] attorney.
[1:17:28] My he becomes your advocate. Thank you,
[1:17:31] Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[1:17:33] And said you have not done anything. You
[1:17:35] are justified to me. I can't even have a
[1:17:38] record of that.
[1:17:40] That's what grace is.
[1:17:43] Because this child called me was he lost
[1:17:47] everything.
[1:17:49] Actually he was hiding.
[1:17:52] Thank you. And that location was called
[1:17:55] Lore. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:17:59] He belonged at that moment. He belonged
[1:18:02] to a rejected house of soul.
[1:18:05] No hope.
[1:18:09] He lost everything.
[1:18:13] But now he never also expected
[1:18:17] that David will send somebody to come
[1:18:19] and rescue him.
[1:18:22] Now let's just stop a little bit here. I
[1:18:24] did some research. What is what does the
[1:18:26] word Labar means?
[1:18:29] Labar is a town in Manasse in Gilead
[1:18:33] east of Jordan.
[1:18:35] The word debar means no word.
[1:18:40] No word.
[1:18:42] Okay. No pasture,
[1:18:44] no fellowship, unfruitful.
[1:18:49] So the place that me went, it was at the
[1:18:53] place where there was no word. It was
[1:18:57] dry. No pasture whatsoever. No fruit,
[1:19:03] unfruitful. Let me put it that way.
[1:19:05] Yeah. Barren. Yeah. No life. Isolated in
[1:19:10] that condition.
[1:19:12] Are you with me?
[1:19:15] He was living out his day in obscurity,
[1:19:19] in darkness, fear, depression.
[1:19:23] Can you imagine Adam and Eve as soon as
[1:19:25] they left the garden of Eden he start
[1:19:27] feeling headache
[1:19:31] this was the estate that men when he
[1:19:33] fall he fell in the garden of Eden right
[1:19:38] you know Mphibosf
[1:19:40] was the son of a king and because of the
[1:19:45] event he felt even at the lowest place
[1:19:48] are you with me that's right amen Now
[1:19:52] watch this.
[1:19:54] He was at a place where there was
[1:19:57] absolutely nothing. Maybe he could eat
[1:20:00] with the dogs.
[1:20:03] Maybe, you know, it's like the the the
[1:20:05] the the child that wasted everything
[1:20:08] that his father gave him.
[1:20:10] He was eating with the pigs.
[1:20:15] We start doing things in our own life,
[1:20:18] you know.
[1:20:19] We stop lying, cheating, drinking,
[1:20:21] smoking, living all kind of life
[1:20:25] because we are down there in lore where
[1:20:28] there's no word, unfruitful, barren.
[1:20:32] That's right. Nobody can come to get us
[1:20:34] in that position.
[1:20:37] You might come probably tonight from a
[1:20:40] broken family.
[1:20:43] Are you with me? Amen. Abuses, curses,
[1:20:48] generational curses that is still
[1:20:51] haunting your life. You know, brother
[1:20:54] Brenham identified three things that has
[1:20:57] a a a source of influence in our life.
[1:21:00] I'll mention those three things.
[1:21:03] One, you mentioned about the zodiac sign
[1:21:05] that you were born under. There is a
[1:21:07] power from the zodiac sign. Every zodiac
[1:21:10] sign, they have a certain nature. It
[1:21:12] talks about the country that you were
[1:21:14] born in and also the family that you
[1:21:17] were born in.
[1:21:19] There are things that we inherit from
[1:21:20] our families. There are spirits that we
[1:21:23] carry because of the place, the location
[1:21:25] we grew up in. And also the sign that
[1:21:28] we're born under.
[1:21:31] So all these three are having an
[1:21:33] influence into our life. Are you with
[1:21:35] me? So true.
[1:21:38] May God help us. Amen.
[1:21:40] Many of us coming from different broken
[1:21:43] family, different issues in here and
[1:21:44] there.
[1:21:46] But let me tell you something. Our God
[1:21:48] specializes. Amen. Amen. In impossible
[1:21:51] stuff like that. When it looks like it's
[1:21:54] totally dark, like there's not even a
[1:21:56] way for you to come out of it. But God
[1:21:59] specializes in impossible cases.
[1:22:03] Thank you, Lord. Amen. For you to enjoy
[1:22:06] the light, you have to be completely in
[1:22:08] darkness. Oh yes. Yes. Amen. Amen. But
[1:22:11] God has spoken into darkness. It says,
[1:22:13] "Let there be light." And there was
[1:22:16] light.
[1:22:18] May the word of God speak to us that
[1:22:21] wherever how it doesn't matter how dark
[1:22:23] we are, that the word of God will
[1:22:26] quicken the seed where it's laying in in
[1:22:28] the darkness.
[1:22:31] Lord, do you believe this?
[1:22:33] Our God specializes. Amen. Saints, don't
[1:22:37] bring just little those little little
[1:22:38] tiny needs before God. Brings those big
[1:22:41] ones that seems to be impossible.
[1:22:45] Because he specializes in those kind of
[1:22:48] cases.
[1:22:50] Amen. Oh my. You must ask for big
[1:22:54] things. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:57] We are the sons and the daughter of the
[1:22:59] king. Huh? Amen. Glory be to God. Amen.
[1:23:03] He spoke to Abraham. It says, "Is there
[1:23:06] anything too hard for the Lord?" No.
[1:23:10] No. No. He makes a way where there's no
[1:23:13] way.
[1:23:15] Who could ever imagine that he was able
[1:23:18] to speak to Moses?
[1:23:22] And then the water open. He says, "Why
[1:23:24] are you afraid? What are why you crying?
[1:23:26] Speak the word." Amen.
[1:23:29] Ever for the first time, we see the
[1:23:32] water of completely opening people back.
[1:23:34] millions of people cross the the the Red
[1:23:37] Sea. Amen. This is the God that we
[1:23:39] serving. He he special I'm repeating
[1:23:42] that again. He specializes in this kind
[1:23:45] of cases. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:48] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:23:52] Number 11 23. And the Lord said unto
[1:23:55] Moses, "Is the Lord's hand wack short?
[1:23:59] Thou shalt see how whether my word shall
[1:24:02] come to pass unto thee or not.
[1:24:06] This is our God. Amen. When he says
[1:24:10] something,
[1:24:11] you stay on it. It will happen.
[1:24:16] Amen.
[1:24:18] Amen. It will happen.
[1:24:22] Thank you, Lord. You know, if you read
[1:24:24] the Bible,
[1:24:27] Aaron had a road. How many of us knew
[1:24:29] that Aaron had a road before the
[1:24:31] presence of the the the glory? Yeah.
[1:24:35] That a dry stick
[1:24:38] bats forth and broke forth flowers.
[1:24:40] That's right. Lift in that presence. If
[1:24:44] a dry stick, Amen. before that presence
[1:24:48] of the shakina glory can bring forth how
[1:24:51] much more you Yeah, that's right. Praise
[1:24:53] the Lord. Amen. Amen. Say, let me say
[1:24:56] this. You are sitting under the
[1:24:59] atmosphere. The same second kind of
[1:25:01] glory
[1:25:03] is here tonight the same way.
[1:25:06] What is hindering God to do something is
[1:25:08] our unbelief.
[1:25:11] Amen. Is because we don't want to
[1:25:13] believe him. Oh yes. Say let me tell you
[1:25:16] something. We can leave tonight
[1:25:18] completely changed tonight if we
[1:25:21] believe. Amen. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:25:26] Oh my in letter bar there's no there's
[1:25:29] no nothing actually absolutely nothing
[1:25:31] there
[1:25:34] but God has promised amen you know he
[1:25:38] needed pasture he needed a land covered
[1:25:41] with grass right because over there
[1:25:44] wherever he was there was no food
[1:25:45] nothing
[1:25:47] no pasture whatsoever unfruitful
[1:25:52] maybe tonight you are unfruitful in your
[1:25:54] ways Mhm. You tried this is not working.
[1:25:56] Oh yes. Let me tell you, we have a God
[1:25:59] that is able to open doors. Praise God.
[1:26:02] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Oh my. There is
[1:26:05] a place of abundance.
[1:26:07] There's a place of abundance. It is in
[1:26:10] the word of God. Psalm chapter 23 says,
[1:26:14] you know, Psalms of David, the Lord is
[1:26:15] my shepherd. I shall not want. He make
[1:26:18] me lie down in what? In green pasture.
[1:26:21] Amen. He leadeth me beside the still
[1:26:24] water. He restore my soul. He leadeth me
[1:26:27] in the path of righteousness for his
[1:26:29] name's sake. Though I walk through the
[1:26:32] valley of the shadow of death, I will
[1:26:34] fear no evil. For thou art with me, thy
[1:26:38] staff, they comfort me. Thou prepareth a
[1:26:42] table before me in the presence of the
[1:26:46] my enemies.
[1:26:48] that I anointed my head with oil and my
[1:26:51] cup runth over. Surely goodness and
[1:26:54] mercy shall follow me. Hallelujah. All
[1:26:58] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[1:27:01] the house of the Lord forever.
[1:27:05] Amen.
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:08] Oh, glory to God. Yes. Said, "If you're
[1:27:12] expecting me to mention different
[1:27:14] things, I can only take the word of God
[1:27:16] and I can only prophesy the word of God
[1:27:18] to you for you to believe." Amen.
[1:27:21] I can't present you anything else. There
[1:27:22] is a word. The word has power enough to
[1:27:25] change your life around.
[1:27:28] I'm not here to please anybody. I'm just
[1:27:30] saying the word of God. I'm only
[1:27:31] repeating what God said. Because there
[1:27:34] is power in it.
[1:27:38] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:27:40] There was a covenant that was made
[1:27:42] between David and Jonathan. 1st Samuel
[1:27:44] 20:14.
[1:27:45] And thou shall not only while yet I I
[1:27:48] leave, show me the kindness of the Lord
[1:27:50] that I die not, but also thou shalt not
[1:27:54] cut off my thy kindred from my house
[1:27:57] forever. No, not when the Lord has cut
[1:28:00] off the enemy of David, everyone from
[1:28:03] the face of the earth. So Jonathan made
[1:28:05] a covenant with the house of David
[1:28:07] saying, "Let the Lord ever require it at
[1:28:12] the hands of David enemy." There was a
[1:28:14] covenant that was signed here between
[1:28:16] David and Jonathan. Are you with me?
[1:28:19] Yeah. And now Jonathan has died. David
[1:28:23] remembers now. He remembers his
[1:28:25] covenant.
[1:28:28] Are you with me? Yeah. Amen. Now in the
[1:28:31] book of numbers verse 30
[1:28:34] verse uh chapter 30:2 if a man vow a vow
[1:28:39] unto the Lord or swear an oath to bind
[1:28:43] his soul with a bond he shall not break
[1:28:46] his word. He shall do according to all
[1:28:50] that precedth out of his mouth. Yeah.
[1:28:53] That's right. Amen. Can you imagine
[1:28:56] David kept his promise? Mhm. Do you
[1:28:59] think God
[1:29:01] will compromise his promise?
[1:29:06] Brother, are you with me? He said,
[1:29:09] "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
[1:29:12] my word shall never pass away." Amen.
[1:29:16] Are you with me? 2 Samuel 22 31. As for
[1:29:20] God, his way is perfect. The word of the
[1:29:24] Lord is tried. Amen. He is a blet to all
[1:29:29] that trust in him. Amen. Amen. He is a
[1:29:34] protection
[1:29:36] for those that trust in him. Amen.
[1:29:40] If David could keep his commandments,
[1:29:42] how much more our God he cannot break
[1:29:44] what he said. Amen. He cannot change his
[1:29:46] mind concerning his word.
[1:29:50] You know, God also made a promise. He
[1:29:52] swore by himself to Abraham that thy
[1:29:55] seed shall possess all the gate of the
[1:29:57] enemy. So if we have a seed of Abraham
[1:30:00] here, you able to possess all the gates
[1:30:02] of your enemy. Because God swore and he
[1:30:05] could not swear by enemy. There's nobody
[1:30:07] above him. He had to swear by himself.
[1:30:10] That's right. Amen. He cannot break his
[1:30:12] word. It is impossible for God to lie.
[1:30:17] Amen. He cannot lie, saints. Amen. You
[1:30:20] stay there. Give Oh, glory to God. Stay
[1:30:23] there until it happened.
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:29] Are you with me? Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:32] Verse five. Then the king David sent,
[1:30:36] watch this. Very important. David said,
[1:30:40] "And
[1:30:42] then David, King David sent and fetch
[1:30:47] him out of the house of Masher, the son
[1:30:51] of Amile from Lobar." In other words,
[1:30:54] the word to fetch out means to take
[1:30:57] something out of, to get in out of
[1:31:01] something. Siege, bring out.
[1:31:05] Seeking someone intentionally.
[1:31:08] Okay.
[1:31:10] Glory to God. Hallelujah. God is
[1:31:13] intentional.
[1:31:15] That's right. Amen. When he's seeking
[1:31:18] his children is intentional. That's
[1:31:20] right. Amen. He says, "Fetch him out of
[1:31:23] that place." Amen. You know, let's stop
[1:31:26] a little bit. Am let's look. Let's let's
[1:31:29] look at the scripture again.
[1:31:31] Am was one of the spies from Dan who
[1:31:36] perished in the plague of his evil
[1:31:38] report.
[1:31:40] This man here.
[1:31:44] So Mphibichef
[1:31:47] was in the house of unbelief.
[1:31:51] Are you catching this? Because out of
[1:31:53] the 12, right, every single one from
[1:31:57] every tribe, only Joshua and Caleb,
[1:32:02] but this guy was among the unbelievers.
[1:32:06] Wow. So, Mphibosf was in the house of
[1:32:10] unbelief.
[1:32:12] He was born in the midst of a mess up.
[1:32:18] If we were to trust every grandfather of
[1:32:20] ours, they were not Christian. Yeah,
[1:32:23] that we were Oh, glory to God. In our
[1:32:25] sin, unbelief was there. But God had a
[1:32:28] seed.
[1:32:31] You see, you were brought you
[1:32:32] biologically, you came from your
[1:32:34] grandfather. Amen. But the seed that was
[1:32:36] there was not from that. Hallelujah.
[1:32:38] That's right. Amen. Thank you.
[1:32:40] Hallelujah. That's when God when he
[1:32:43] elect, he can go even deep when there's
[1:32:45] darkness. Is is seeking in darkness.
[1:32:47] Amen. You can have different habits in
[1:32:49] your your your flesh. You're still
[1:32:51] struggling with things from the your
[1:32:53] your parents and all of it still is
[1:32:54] still having a hold on you. But the seed
[1:32:57] is there. And he's still calling you by
[1:32:59] your name. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:02] That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:04] Oh my. F him out of the house of
[1:33:06] unbelief. F him out of the the house of
[1:33:09] fear, of negativity, the house of
[1:33:12] bondage.
[1:33:14] It does not belong to the house of
[1:33:16] unbelief. That's right. That's not his
[1:33:18] place. Amen. Fed him out of it. Thank
[1:33:22] you, Lord. Amen.
[1:33:25] You know, he lived in Laabar for 17
[1:33:28] years. Wow. You know, number 17 in the
[1:33:32] numerology of God means a change. That's
[1:33:34] right.
[1:33:36] It's a season of change. Is the change
[1:33:38] of system.
[1:33:40] You know, the Bible is so Oh my
[1:33:42] goodness.
[1:33:44] when he reached the seven the 17th year.
[1:33:47] There was a year of change, he had to be
[1:33:50] fetched out of that place. That's right.
[1:33:54] Are you with me? Right. But let me just
[1:33:57] stop a little bit here. Let's let let's
[1:33:59] dig into this word. Let let's look at
[1:34:02] Mashir, right? Masher here. The word
[1:34:06] masher means sold or seller. One whom is
[1:34:13] already sold. Someone that is already
[1:34:15] sold to unbelief. Wow. Are you with me?
[1:34:19] Amen. Uhoh. The house of Mashia, right?
[1:34:25] It was already sold to unbelief. Wow.
[1:34:30] That was the place where Mphibichef was.
[1:34:33] Are you with me? Yeah. That's right. But
[1:34:35] let's look at the name Mibushef.
[1:34:37] There you go. Meibosf means
[1:34:40] exterminating the idol. Hallelujah.
[1:34:43] Exterminator of shame. That's right.
[1:34:46] Amen. You see his Oh, glory to God. His
[1:34:50] purpose in life was to destroy idols.
[1:34:53] Hallelujah. Even if he was stressing
[1:34:55] back from his family, but yet in him,
[1:34:58] his name, his identity was to destroy
[1:35:02] his enemy.
[1:35:05] Amen. Are you with me? Yes. Amen. His
[1:35:08] true identity, his true character
[1:35:13] was he was he was predestinated
[1:35:16] to destroy shame
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:20] to exterminate idols. That's what the
[1:35:23] Bible sometime if you if you study the
[1:35:25] book of Kings, there's a father that
[1:35:27] will live wrong and get into idol.
[1:35:29] There's one child that will come out of
[1:35:30] that. He would destroy all the altar of
[1:35:33] bail. Amen. Amen. because he was a child
[1:35:36] that was anointed to destroy the enemy.
[1:35:40] Oh my. I'm I love breaking the cycle.
[1:35:45] I'm a strong believer of that. I don't
[1:35:48] believe in sorcery. Even though they
[1:35:49] exist, but they have no power over my
[1:35:52] life.
[1:35:53] There's no demon in hell that can touch
[1:35:56] an elect of God. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:35:59] Amen. We can sleep in the same bed, but
[1:36:02] they have no control over me. Amen.
[1:36:04] Amen. Don't fear them, saints.
[1:36:06] Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, glory to God. We
[1:36:09] are the children of God.
[1:36:11] We were we were born with a a price.
[1:36:14] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[1:36:17] God. Amen. That that's what I believe.
[1:36:20] Amen. Amen. You know he he did not
[1:36:23] belong there but due to the
[1:36:25] circumstances of life due to the mistake
[1:36:27] of his nurse
[1:36:29] due to the mistake of what happened in
[1:36:31] the garden of Eden.
[1:36:36] The the fall had crippled him.
[1:36:40] His first birth was already compromised.
[1:36:44] I'm glad that God sent his only begotten
[1:36:46] son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the
[1:36:50] offspring of David, die. And now he sent
[1:36:54] he sent a messenger zipper, the Holy
[1:36:57] Spirit to go seek for the one that was
[1:37:00] lost.
[1:37:02] You know, the restoration of the bride,
[1:37:04] but the brother calls it a reinforcer of
[1:37:06] the claim. He goes to enforce the claim.
[1:37:09] He says, "Take it back.
[1:37:12] I need to take my child back where he
[1:37:14] belong. So he sent the Holy Ghost to go
[1:37:17] and seek for the elect.
[1:37:20] That's right. You might be in Labor, but
[1:37:22] the Holy Spirit is seeking you tonight.
[1:37:26] Thank you, Lord. He's telling you, come
[1:37:28] out of the house of bondage. Come out of
[1:37:31] that sin with deliverance. Be separated
[1:37:33] from the things of the world. Thank you,
[1:37:35] Lord.
[1:37:38] Oh, glory to God. A voice in Revelation
[1:37:41] 18:4, I heard another voice from heaven
[1:37:44] says, "Come out of her, my people."
[1:37:47] That ye be not partakers of her sin.
[1:37:50] Amen. 2 Corinthians chapter 6:14, "Be ye
[1:37:54] not unequally yoke unequally yolked
[1:37:57] together with unbelievers."
[1:37:59] For what fellowship as righteousness
[1:38:01] with unrighteousness? That's right. And
[1:38:03] what communion as light with darkness?
[1:38:05] That's right. And what a has Christ with
[1:38:08] billia? Oh, what part is he that
[1:38:11] believeth with an affidel? And what
[1:38:14] agreement is the temple of God with
[1:38:16] idols? For ye are the temple of the
[1:38:19] living God. As God has said, I will
[1:38:23] dwell in them and walk in them. I will
[1:38:26] be their God. They shall be my people.
[1:38:29] Therefore, come out among them. Be ye
[1:38:32] separated, says the Lord. Touch not your
[1:38:35] uncle things. I will receive you. Right.
[1:38:38] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:38:42] Come out of the system. Sure.
[1:38:44] Jezebelism, balance, balamism. Amen. You
[1:38:48] know, our sister need to live a certain
[1:38:50] way. There must be a difference between
[1:38:53] the women out there and here. There must
[1:38:56] be a difference. The men here are must
[1:38:59] be different than the men out there. The
[1:39:01] way we carry our family should be
[1:39:03] different. The way we behavior must be
[1:39:05] different. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. We
[1:39:09] have a purpose. Hallelujah.
[1:39:11] We are the sons of the daughter of God.
[1:39:14] Amen.
[1:39:16] Now watch this. Verse six. Now Mibos,
[1:39:19] the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
[1:39:21] came unto David. He fell on his face and
[1:39:24] did reverence. And David said, Mibos, he
[1:39:28] answered, "Behold thy servant, bowing
[1:39:31] with reverence."
[1:39:32] You can only have reverence for the word
[1:39:34] of God when you know where we came from
[1:39:36] and the privilege, the un undeserved
[1:39:39] grace that you have received. Amen.

[1:39:43] "Whoa, I'm I'm the son of the king's
[1:39:45] soul. I'm the great No. He bow himself
[1:39:48] down. I'm not worthy to come in your

[1:40:45] of the Babylonian system to get you into
[1:40:48] the body of Jesus Christ. And the only
[1:40:50] way you can join the body is by the new
[1:40:53] birth.

[1:41:12] been compromising sin and different
[1:41:14] things,
[1:41:16] but God has given us grace. Amen. a
[1:41:19] special grace. Amen. So every time that
[1:41:22] we reject that grace, we're going far
[1:41:24] away from God. But God is inviting you
[1:41:27] tonight.
[1:41:29] Leave lot of bar. I've already sent a
[1:41:32] messenger to fetch you out of that
[1:41:33] system.
[1:41:35] You cannot say, "Oh, I did not know."
[1:41:37] I'm telling you now tonight, church, he
[1:41:41] has sent a messenger with a message.
[1:41:43] Amen. To bring you back. Actually the
[1:41:46] ministry of Elijah is to restore. Amen.

[1:41:59] Pentecostal father. Amen. Amen. It's the
[1:42:03] time of restoration. Amen. It's the time
[1:42:05] of restitution of all things. This is
[1:42:07] the time. I wish I had more time to read
[1:42:10] that scripture. time.
[1:42:13] This is the time of restoration. Joel
[1:42:16] chapter 2 verse 28.
[1:42:20] My And it shall come to pass after, I
[1:42:23] will pour out my spirit upon all flesh,
[1:42:25] and your son, your daughter shall
[1:42:27] prophesy. Your old men shall dream
[1:42:29] dreams. Your young men shall see vision
[1:42:32] and also upon the servant upon the
[1:42:34] headmade. In those day, I will pour out
[1:42:36] my spirit. Right? And Peter's sermon on
[1:42:40] the day of Pentecost, it says, "But this
[1:42:42] is that."
[1:42:45] This is that that Joy spoke about.
[1:42:47] That's right. The Holy Spirit is
[1:42:50] available.
[1:42:52] Amen. You know, if you have the desire
[1:42:55] to receive the Holy Spirit, you don't
[1:42:57] that desire did not just come randomly
[1:42:59] like that. Because there is something
[1:43:01] that is seeking for the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:04] Amen. Amen. Amen. Jesus says, you know,
[1:43:07] blessed are they that seek for
[1:43:08] righteousness, those they shall be
[1:43:10] filled. Those that hunger, right? Those
[1:43:12] that hunger and thirst after
[1:43:13] righteousness, they shall be filled. If
[1:43:16] you thirst something, you know, when you
[1:43:20] are thirsty, it doesn't mean that you
[1:43:22] don't have water in you.
[1:43:25] It doesn't mean that your body does not
[1:43:26] have water when you're thirsty.
[1:43:29] You just need more of it. There's
[1:43:31] already water in your body, but you need
[1:43:33] more of it. There is a part of God that
[1:43:35] is already you but you testing for more
[1:43:38] of that thing that is there.
[1:43:41] Thank you. Are you are you catching this
[1:43:43] thing?
[1:43:46] So if you you desiring the Holy Spirit
[1:43:49] means that there is something in there.
[1:43:51] You need more of that.
[1:43:54] Saints if there is a time that the
[1:43:56] church need to seek for the baptism the
[1:43:57] Holy Ghost is now. We are at the closing
[1:44:00] hour of the history of the world.
[1:44:03] Everything is happening. If you if
[1:44:04] you've been listening to the news, it's
[1:44:06] happening.
[1:44:08] Glory to God. But God gave us the spirit
[1:44:12] that we can stay in prayer and say,
[1:44:13] "Lord, I need it now." Then we will all
[1:44:16] be very consecrated to God.
[1:44:19] Even if we cannot do it by ourself,
[1:44:22] let's stay there until it happen. If you
[1:44:26] are still struggling, stay a little
[1:44:27] longer in prayer. Have prayer meeting.

[1:44:40] on social media playing games. No,
[1:44:43] I have to be there too waiting until the
[1:44:46] Holy Ghost comes. While other brothers
[1:44:48] are also praying, they pray together.

[1:44:58] Wednesday. Oh yes. and to pour the Holy
[1:45:00] Spirit upon this place. Amen. That our
[1:45:03] young people will be changed.
[1:45:08] Hallelujah. You know, I believe that
[1:45:10] something is happening in this place.
[1:45:13] Amen.
[1:45:14] I believe that something is happening. I
[1:45:16] don't know if somebody's catching this.

[1:45:24] making herself ready. Amen. Yes. Are you
[1:45:28] with me?
[1:45:30] Can you imagine
[1:45:32] if you read the book of Joel where we
[1:45:34] just read, it says, "I will restore to
[1:45:36] you the year that the locust has eaten.
[1:45:40] The conquer, the conqueror worm, the
[1:45:42] caterpillar and the palmer worm, my
[1:45:44] great army which I sent among you."
[1:45:46] There were four insect that came to
[1:45:48] destroy that tree.

[1:46:09] of life restores the tree." Amen. Do you
[1:46:14] get it? Amen. Amen. For God said, "I
[1:46:18] will restore it." That's God's word.
[1:46:21] That is so by himself that he will

[1:46:25] Watch this. He's going to restore it.

[1:47:57] Oh my. I'm going a different direction,
[1:47:59] but I trust that the Lord will be able
[1:48:00] to help us.
[1:48:04] Wow. Revelation chapter 10 verse one.
[1:48:08] And I saw a mighty angel come down from
[1:48:11] heaven. That's the covenant angel. That
[1:48:14] was Christ clothed with a cloud and a
[1:48:17] rainbow was upon his head.
[1:48:20] And his face was as it were the sun, as
[1:48:23] his feet, as the pillar of fire, as a
[1:48:25] fire, sorry. He had in his hand a little
[1:48:29] book open. In Revelation chapter 7, uh
[1:48:32] five, the book was closed. Nobody was
[1:48:34] ready to look. We talked about it last
[1:48:36] time. This now the book is open. Are you

[1:49:05] What other thunders are the voice of
[1:49:07] God? Are you with me? Amen. They are the
[1:49:09] voice of God. Amen. And when the seven
[1:49:12] thunders had altered their voice, I was
[1:49:14] about to write and I heard a voice from
[1:49:16] heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those
[1:49:19] things which the seven thunders and
[1:49:23] utter and write them not." Are you with
[1:49:26] me? And the angel which are still
[1:49:29] standing upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:49:31] lift up his hand to heaven. What did he
[1:49:33] do? He swear by himself.

[1:50:07] of the seventh angel,
[1:50:10] when it shall begin to sound, the
[1:50:13] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:50:17] has declared to his servant what the
[1:50:20] prophets." Amen. He spoke to Daniel
[1:50:22] about this. He says, "Seal up the book.
[1:50:25] Yeah, it will be revealed at the end. At
[1:50:28] the end when this this time that we

[1:51:09] servant and said unto him, I have given
[1:51:11] unto thee thy master son all

[1:51:18] me continue. That's fine. I have given
[1:51:21] unto thy servant son all that that
[1:51:23] pertain to soul and to his house all his
[1:51:26] house. Thou therefore thy son and thy
[1:51:29] servant shall tilt the land for him. You

[1:51:35] and thy master son may have food to eat.
[1:51:39] But mef
[1:51:41] thy servant's son shall eat bread always
[1:51:47] at my table. Now Ze, can you imagine
[1:51:51] this?
[1:51:52] He became as the son of the king. Now
[1:51:55] let's go to 12. And Mephibosef had a
[1:51:58] young son whose name was Mikah. And all
[1:52:00] that dwelt in the house of Zepha was
[1:52:02] servant unto me. So Mphibichef dwell in
[1:52:06] Jerusalem.

[1:52:48] he's eating the word of God in contact
[1:52:51] with the word of God is bringing
[1:52:52] healing.
[1:52:54] Cuz God had already sent his only son to
[1:52:56] die for you. The price has already been
[1:52:59] paid. The only thing is for you to go
[1:53:02] back to your position. Amen. Thank you,
[1:53:05] Lord. You might have hurt in your life.
[1:53:08] I'm closing.
[1:53:11] But the word has come to heal those
[1:53:14] wounds. Amen.
[1:53:16] Amen. God is dealing with every single
[1:53:19] one of us hearts. If we were to talk
[1:53:21] about what we are dealing with in our
[1:53:23] own life, some of us probably close our
[1:53:25] ears. I don't want to hear it.
[1:53:28] But we are sitting here because grace
[1:53:30] and grace with grace is here this
[1:53:33] evening.

[1:55:03] take me out of Laabar to bring me to
[1:55:06] Jerusalem
[1:55:08] the place of peace. A place where I can
