[42:14] amen
[42:16] [Music]
[42:18] amen
[42:18] [Music]
[42:23] amen
[42:28] you know the scripture says that uh
[42:34] when jesus walked with those men on the
[42:36] road of emmaus
[42:40] they did not recognize him he talked to
[42:43] them
[42:44] until in the evening time
[42:50] and when he paid him to come
[42:57] and they were about to eat the bible
[42:59] says he took the bread
[43:03] and he broke it
[43:06] and the eyes were open
[43:09] you know brother branham has
[43:14] used their scripture and talk about the
[43:16] breaking of the bread and
[43:17] and apply a lot of spiritual
[43:21] significance to the breaking of the
[43:23] bread which of course we know the
[43:25] breaking of the bread has a lot of
[43:27] spiritual
[43:28] significance as he broke the bread their
[43:30] eyes open
[43:31] but there is there is another thing also
[43:35] when you when you think about it you
[43:37] just you just meditate upon it i was
[43:39] i was thinking meditating upon that and
[43:42] you realize that when jesus took the
[43:45] bread
[43:49] there was uh there was a physical
[43:52] element
[43:54] there was a physical element that
[43:56] identified him
[44:00] and that physical element was the skies
[44:03] on his hands
[44:11] when he took the bread to break it
[44:14] definitely when the person is breaking
[44:15] bread
[44:16] with their hands all eyes goes on the
[44:20] hands
[44:28] there's a song of
[44:31] fanny crosby
[44:36] but branham talks about it
[44:39] as i know him i shall know him
[44:47] brother branham said she got struck with
[44:49] the inspiration of that song
[44:54] when some of the markers and scoffers
[44:59] were trying to criticize her
[45:01] thinking about jesus and yes she was a
[45:03] blind woman
[45:06] and he says fanning how will you know
[45:08] him
[45:10] she says i shall know him i shall know
[45:13] him
[45:15] by the print of his nails the nails cast
[45:18] in his hands
[45:21] praise the lord amen
[45:26] that is the only human thing
[45:29] that is the only man may think that
[45:32] would be in heaven
[45:35] the nail scans because the newscasts are
[45:39] made me
[45:43] that's the only man may think
[45:47] that makes immortality
[45:52] is the nail print
[45:55] praise the lord amen
[46:02] amen
[46:05] the lord bless you tonight thank you

[49:55] you may have your seed praise the lord
[49:58] so
[49:58] uh as we we were trying to testify here
[50:02] uh uh about sister pierre's daddy
[50:06] and uh like i said she told to us that
[50:09] he was around so we felt that it would
[50:12] be good for him to come in
[50:14] and fellowship with us
[50:17] just to get to know him and praise the
[50:20] lord
[50:22] and so he came and
[50:26] he he really had a good time praise the
[50:28] lord you know he really had a good time
[50:30] he stayed there with brother
[50:32] brother bannon you know but ben was
[50:34] telling me you know he wakes up early in
[50:36] the morning he goes for his walk
[50:38] and you know he jog you or you see him
[50:41] looking like a strong young man amen
[50:44] praise the lord amen
[50:47] but uh uh i also noticed that he was
[50:51] using a hearing aid which sister bearer
[50:54] told me that
[50:55] her brother you know bought that for him
[50:57] because he had
[50:58] he was developing problem with his
[51:00] hearing
[51:01] and then he went home and uh we got a
[51:04] prayer request on sunday
[51:06] to pray for him and which of course we
[51:08] did
[51:09] year then and she called me today
[51:13] testifying that the lord touched her
[51:15] father
[51:16] and his will amen praise the lord
[51:20] and not only that he's well but
[51:23] uh the lord has has has blessed him
[51:26] and instead of the hearing aid helping
[51:30] him
[51:31] hearing it is disturbing his hearing
[51:33] because he's hearing better
[51:34] than using a hearing aid
[51:43] praise the lord
[51:45] [Applause]
[51:47] amen the lord the lord has the lord has
[51:50] made his hearing better amen
[51:53] amen and you know the way god built the
[51:56] human body is that
[51:58] the hearing influenced the talking
[52:01] when you are losing your hearing your
[52:03] talking starts to become blurred
[52:06] if you sticks around people that
[52:10] do sign language you will understand and
[52:13] most of them that were not born that way
[52:16] but starts to use sign language because
[52:18] they start losing their
[52:20] their their hearing and that's that's
[52:23] exactly what happened
[52:24] you know so uh uh
[52:28] she said she heard her dad sounding so
[52:30] clear and
[52:33] and he says every time he put the
[52:35] hearing aid in his ears is just
[52:38] bothering him is
[52:39] making a lot of noise so we want to
[52:41] thank the lord for that
[52:43] you know we want to thank the lord for
[52:45] that and you know and i was our sister
[52:47] was
[52:48] she was telling me that uh
[52:51] you know she she actually been been
[52:54] praying and asking
[52:55] why you know we we granted the offer for
[52:58] her dad to come in and fellowship with
[53:00] us for me i just wanted to see him
[53:04] maybe god had other reasons but for me i
[53:06] just wanted to get to know him
[53:08] praise the lord and then she itself i
[53:11] mean she was she was thinking and you
[53:13] know just praying lord is that a reason
[53:15] and another thing and and she felt
[53:18] blessing of her to know that uh
[53:20] you know uh the reason was to help him
[53:23] with his hearing praise the lord
[53:26] so we thank the lord for that you know
[53:28] we thank the lord for that
[53:30] and uh uh
[53:33] praise the lord you know sister she's
[53:36] she's a quiet
[53:37] quiet woman but she's a very prayerful
[53:40] woman
[53:42] and there are there are other things
[53:44] that i will keep to myself
[53:47] i mean there are a lot of things that
[53:48] she have told me and they have just come
[53:50] to pass
[53:51] just like that just like they are one
[53:55] after another and
[53:58] uh
[54:02] i mean uh yeah so you know we thank the
[54:05] lord
[54:06] and you realize all the time i had to
[54:09] i had to read two dreams year in in
[54:12] church which of course there were three
[54:14] dreams but they were just
[54:16] back to back in and from two different
[54:18] persons that don't even know
[54:20] one another because i think associate
[54:22] names with that
[54:24] you know uh and and and
[54:27] you know spiritual things must be guided
[54:33] if you realize i don't play with
[54:34] spiritual things
[54:36] when things are spiritual they must be
[54:39] guided
[54:40] praise the lord amen
[54:43] and uh
[54:47] and and that's the way i deal with
[54:50] spiritual things
[54:54] because
[54:57] many of the time you know that when god
[54:59] starts to
[55:00] to help a church or starts to help an
[55:03] individual
[55:04] when uh when when when that
[55:08] gift is not guarded or whatever god is
[55:11] doing in their home or their family
[55:13] or their individual life if it's not
[55:15] guarded
[55:16] you know when one satan is going to
[55:19] attack death
[55:20] and two you know uh uh
[55:24] you know the flesh can get in it
[55:27] and when the flesh gets in it then it
[55:29] stinks in god's nose
[55:32] you don't want to have anything to do
[55:33] with it because he had
[55:35] his god in the flesh praise the lord
[55:40] amen so uh uh
[55:43] there are things i will tell you but i
[55:45] will tell you in the future
[55:48] but it's good to be in the house of the
[55:49] lord tonight
[55:51] amen amen it's good to be in the house
[55:54] of the lord tonight
[55:56] and uh tomorrow my wife and myself we
[56:00] will get another anniversary
[56:02] so we thank the lord for for
[56:07] keeping us keeping us
[56:11] praise the lord you know i was
[56:14] you know when you when you have a
[56:16] thought on your mind you become so
[56:18] anxious to preach
[56:19] but i should have kept my message what
[56:21] brother branham said his wife's tool
[56:23] between him
[56:24] and the public i should have preached it
[56:26] tonight
[56:28] it would have been a fitting message for
[56:30] tonight praise the lord
[56:32] amen i proposed to my wife on february
[56:38] 25th
[56:40] 2000 you know
[56:44] uh the wives keep the wedding date
[56:47] but the man we keep the night we propose
[56:52] praise the lord the wedding did it for
[56:54] the woman
[56:59] the day that we choose to propose we
[57:01] keep there
[57:02] is very special to us so
[57:06] it was it was february 25th
[57:11] 2000 about maybe
[57:14] about around 5 45 in the evening i still
[57:17] remember
[57:20] because i was going to seal my life
[57:28] i praise the lord so but the lord has
[57:31] been good to us
[57:33] the lord has been good to us uh uh
[57:37] we we win now
[57:40] about uh uh six years uh
[57:43] then before we got married and so
[57:47] uh i mean there were just there were
[57:48] just a lot of things that were happening
[57:50] there
[57:50] not things contrary to the word but
[57:52] circumstances were
[57:54] coming up for which that we
[57:57] we couldn't do our wedding i was
[58:00] a pastor in the small church and i
[58:03] wanted to do my wedding on the
[58:04] dedication of that church
[58:06] we just built a building i was thinking
[58:09] about
[58:13] i was thinking about blowing the photos
[58:17] but i just didn't have time to do it
[58:19] before service to now i was going to
[58:21] show you the church that we were
[58:22] building
[58:23] small uh village church
[58:26] so we were hoping to do do the
[58:28] dedication
[58:29] that year i wanted to do it december
[58:33] and then uh we were going to do our
[58:37] wedding but then the
[58:38] the wall came and
[58:46] okay just after we finished praying i
[58:49] received a word
[58:50] that my brother joe admitted out of
[58:53] surgery everything went well
[58:55] praise god thank you for continuing
[58:58] prayers
[58:59] as he recovered from a 12-hour surgery
[59:02] praise the lord we want to thank the
[59:04] lord for that amen
[59:06] amen
[59:16] praise the lord we want to thank the
[59:18] lord for that
[59:20] so yeah and uh i mean so that's that's
[59:23] how we've been going on
[59:24] praise the lord amen and and i want to i
[59:28] just
[59:28] thank the lord for for everything his
[59:30] grace is doing for us
[59:32] and uh so just just continue to pray for
[59:37] us
[59:38] amen we need your prayers but tonight i
[59:41] want to talk on something uh
[59:44] uh
[59:47] maybe i could talk on marriage tonight
[59:52] but i'm not
[59:55] i might be in the flesh if i do that
[1:00:01] praise the lord amen
[1:00:04] amen tonight i want to speak on
[1:00:09] on something that we read from
[1:00:14] the message
[1:00:19] the restoration of the bride tree i read
[1:00:22] a quote of brother branham did and then
[1:00:24] we would take a talk
[1:00:25] that we want to talk on i've actually
[1:00:28] been studying on speaking on
[1:00:31] the rejected king and actually
[1:00:34] uh when brother brandon preached the
[1:00:36] message the rejected king
[1:00:38] you know what
[1:00:42] the the inspiration that was behind that
[1:00:44] message that brother brennan preached
[1:00:46] was the rejection of the word
[1:00:51] the rejection of the leadership
[1:00:54] when people reject the leadership of the
[1:00:57] holy spirit
[1:00:59] praise the lord amen
[1:01:02] there was that was that was what was
[1:01:04] under the message he preached
[1:01:07] you know because but when we get there
[1:01:10] when we get there we will look at it
[1:01:11] because we
[1:01:12] will be looking at the the different the
[1:01:15] different gifts that god
[1:01:17] has designed to lead his people
[1:01:20] praise the lord amen
[1:01:24] so uh uh and and there you will
[1:01:28] understand
[1:01:29] why it have to be one man that's god
[1:01:31] design
[1:01:32] you never have two kings in the kingdom
[1:01:36] amen you don't have a king and an
[1:01:38] assistant king or a vice king
[1:01:41] it does not work like that that's the
[1:01:44] reason why
[1:01:45] there is no human government
[1:01:48] will become successful even
[1:01:52] the the countries that are stayed
[1:01:54] practicing uh
[1:01:56] uh you know a kind of a monarchy form of
[1:01:58] government that i it has become so
[1:02:00] corrupted
[1:02:02] right because even the kingship
[1:02:07] is supposed to be honor god
[1:02:13] praise the lord even the kingship
[1:02:16] supposed to be on a god sure praise the
[1:02:19] lord so
[1:02:19] i mean in in everything you you come
[1:02:21] even to the family life
[1:02:23] you know no two men must rule the same
[1:02:26] home
[1:02:27] there is one man to a home
[1:02:31] but that man will not be successful
[1:02:34] until he comes under the leadership of
[1:02:37] god
[1:02:39] when it comes to a church there is no
[1:02:41] true pastor in the church
[1:02:44] there is one man that is set over the
[1:02:46] church
[1:02:48] and again we will not be successful
[1:02:51] until
[1:02:52] that man is subjected to the leadership
[1:02:56] of the holy spirit
[1:02:58] so when we get there there are a lot of
[1:03:00] things that we will learn
[1:03:04] and we pray that the lord will help us
[1:03:07] amen but let's look at this tonight
[1:03:11] this is this is like a faith a faith
[1:03:14] building
[1:03:14] message like
[1:03:18] like the prophet will say so for the
[1:03:20] prayer meeting tonight let's look at
[1:03:21] this brother branham said
[1:03:23] there's a lord
[1:03:26] there's a lord oh
[1:03:30] if i ever get to my text
[1:03:35] praise the lord you know people uh
[1:03:39] brother branham was not a scholar
[1:03:44] amen brother branham was not a scholar
[1:03:48] uh uh uh you know so sometimes people
[1:03:52] uh uh uh you know uh
[1:03:55] they get they get things all mixed up
[1:03:58] you know
[1:04:00] brother branham was a prophet
[1:04:05] he was a prophet
[1:04:10] and it's just like a preacher
[1:04:15] glory be to god amen you know the lord
[1:04:19] has simple way that he
[1:04:20] he answered our prayers i would say that
[1:04:23] i wanted to testify about it i forgot
[1:04:26] and uh you know i was i was in the
[1:04:28] office
[1:04:30] you know and i was i was just praying
[1:04:32] and uh
[1:04:33] you know my brother hillary clinton you
[1:04:35] know the the man of god
[1:04:37] wanted for us to learn this song you
[1:04:39] know and then
[1:04:40] sometimes he would say we called the
[1:04:43] humble servant of god
[1:04:44] you know you so i was just there i was
[1:04:46] praying i said lord
[1:04:49] let brother hillary just say brother
[1:04:51] warren come up tonight
[1:04:54] and then he says i call brother one i
[1:04:56] said thank you jesus
[1:04:58] simple praying
[1:05:08] praise the lord oh my goodness
[1:05:13] when he when he called me humble seven
[1:05:15] then i really need to be humble i feel
[1:05:17] like crying to come to the pulpit
[1:05:24] and every time i say i will call this
[1:05:25] brother and he says just call me brother
[1:05:27] warren
[1:05:28] and then i forget you know but the lord
[1:05:30] just did it tonight himself
[1:05:33] so let's let's get to our talk tonight
[1:05:35] praise the lord
[1:05:41] there's a law oh if i ever get to my
[1:05:45] text there's a lord
[1:05:48] there's a lord giving
[1:05:52] among everything and that's my message
[1:05:55] tonight
[1:05:57] there's a lord giving among
[1:06:02] everything
[1:06:05] to everything there is
[1:06:08] a lord
[1:06:13] and what is the lord giving for
[1:06:16] the lord is the governing power
[1:06:21] of that thing the lord
[1:06:24] is giving to govern
[1:06:28] whatever god put in place
[1:06:34] amen he put a law in that thing
[1:06:40] the law that he puts in the sun that's
[1:06:43] what makes the sun
[1:06:44] to come up set go down
[1:06:49] no one running there to move the sun
[1:06:53] amen it's the law that god
[1:06:57] put in it
[1:07:00] like brother branham said if i'll ever
[1:07:03] get to my text
[1:07:06] you realize that there are things
[1:07:09] that brother branham
[1:07:13] preach and he speak about
[1:07:18] i mean it it blows the mind
[1:07:23] off of educated people they argue about
[1:07:27] it and fuss about it
[1:07:28] why because it's coming from an electric
[1:07:30] man but it's not
[1:07:32] an electric man you see it's god
[1:07:38] god choosing a vessel and god putting a
[1:07:42] man
[1:07:42] in a place that the things that he would
[1:07:45] do
[1:07:45] through that man
[1:07:49] just like he said to simon flesh and
[1:07:52] blood
[1:07:52] has not relayed this to you
[1:07:56] you can both of it you can attribute it
[1:07:59] to yourself
[1:08:01] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:08:03] brother branham did not attribute those
[1:08:05] things to himself
[1:08:06] it's people that are trying to make him
[1:08:08] what he did not even
[1:08:10] make himself
[1:08:14] and that's what we have to be careful
[1:08:16] about
[1:08:21] because i believe with all of my heart
[1:08:23] if brother branham will stay here
[1:08:25] he will frown many things that people
[1:08:27] are saying about him
[1:08:28] and many things that people are i i you
[1:08:30] know want to do of him
[1:08:32] but let's go to the word here there is a
[1:08:34] lord giving
[1:08:36] among everything
[1:08:39] everything there is a lot now and if you
[1:08:43] think about it
[1:08:46] you look at the ordinance giving
[1:08:50] to israel the commandment the statutes
[1:08:54] and that's the reason why paul says and
[1:08:57] is proving throughout the scripture
[1:09:00] that no flesh
[1:09:05] can fulfill the law because the lord
[1:09:08] was not giving for you it was not giving
[1:09:12] for us
[1:09:14] the law was not giving as a rule
[1:09:18] for us to do to be right
[1:09:22] the lord was giving because
[1:09:27] god
[1:09:30] set his governance
[1:09:34] in the lord as we go along you will
[1:09:37] understand what i mean
[1:09:38] by that i'm trying to find the best word
[1:09:40] to express myself
[1:09:44] but to everything there is
[1:09:47] a lord
[1:09:51] praise the lord
[1:09:57] and he goes on he says you know a fish
[1:10:01] has a law and that fish
[1:10:06] can stand up here in water
[1:10:10] and he has a law within him
[1:10:15] praise the lord now you see
[1:10:19] uh uh uh what man in science has done
[1:10:24] you know the people that build
[1:10:25] submarines and and
[1:10:27] and and and the people that
[1:10:30] that are trained to to to dive
[1:10:33] on the water and in in every equipment
[1:10:36] that they have
[1:10:37] made to be able to make a man to go on a
[1:10:40] waterfall
[1:10:41] more than five minutes or more than you
[1:10:44] know an hour
[1:10:45] and and everything can and carry that
[1:10:48] his camera and carry whatever he carries
[1:10:50] there
[1:10:51] everything that they have built
[1:10:55] man has been able to study
[1:10:59] god's creation they take a fish
[1:11:04] and steady the fish
[1:11:08] so well they study
[1:11:12] every part of the fish
[1:11:16] and from there they get their
[1:11:19] inspiration
[1:11:20] to be able to make an equipment
[1:11:25] that a man can either put himself in
[1:11:28] or the man can put to his nose so the
[1:11:31] man can put on his body
[1:11:32] and then he can be able to go under the
[1:11:34] water and be and
[1:11:36] and swim just like a fish
[1:11:42] what are they doing they are studying
[1:11:45] the law of god
[1:11:48] that keeps a creature on the water
[1:11:55] praise the lord
[1:11:59] i listened to this message and and uh
[1:12:02] i got i got caught up with uh uh
[1:12:05] uh i got caught up with the design
[1:12:09] of a bird because you know vert bearing
[1:12:11] talks about the bird
[1:12:12] and i didn't know that the fish would
[1:12:13] come before the birds so
[1:12:15] uh uh there were some things i wanted to
[1:12:18] look at on fish
[1:12:20] and uh to be able to bring this to you
[1:12:22] tonight but
[1:12:23] we just we're just beginning this we
[1:12:25] might be able to take a few times
[1:12:26] because there is there is something that
[1:12:28] we want to get to
[1:12:29] there is something that we want to
[1:12:30] achieve by by bringing this to you amen
[1:12:36] he said you know a fish has a lot
[1:12:41] and that fish can stand up here in water
[1:12:45] and he has a lot
[1:12:48] within him
[1:12:52] you see the law to everything that god
[1:12:55] made
[1:12:56] is not out of that thing
[1:13:00] the law is in him if we just take an
[1:13:03] example there's a law
[1:13:04] of life within us
[1:13:09] praise the lord if there should come a
[1:13:12] huge noise
[1:13:14] across the street that comes through
[1:13:15] this building everybody is going to
[1:13:18] shake a little bit we want to know what
[1:13:19] is happening out there because we want
[1:13:21] to get away why we want to get away from
[1:13:23] danger
[1:13:24] is because we want to live
[1:13:29] praise the lord
[1:13:32] why why we we when we get sick
[1:13:36] we want the lord to heal us i believe by
[1:13:38] the grace of god we are not afraid of
[1:13:40] hell
[1:13:43] amen it's not because we believe that
[1:13:45] when we die we will go to hell no all
[1:13:48] that's one other thing that the new
[1:13:49] breadth of takes away from you
[1:13:51] it takes away the fear of hell
[1:13:56] because him that is in christ there is
[1:13:58] no condemnation unto him
[1:14:00] he has passed from death on to life
[1:14:04] and because there is a law of life in
[1:14:07] our body
[1:14:08] that's the reason why we want to live
[1:14:12] yes
[1:14:15] when we get sick we we just feel so bad
[1:14:18] and and
[1:14:18] oh my goodness i i just hate this
[1:14:21] sickness because we want to live
[1:14:23] you see so the law of everything
[1:14:27] god placed that law with anything
[1:14:31] there is not a law outside governing
[1:14:34] you see that is the reason why when that
[1:14:37] when the new birth comes
[1:14:39] it gives you a law for a higher kingdom
[1:14:43] it puts it in you
[1:14:44] now if you have a church rule that says
[1:14:47] don't do this we don't do the in the
[1:14:49] message we don't do
[1:14:50] all of those laws they are extended law
[1:14:52] that's the reason why you can feel
[1:14:54] offended
[1:14:54] when people are trying to law over you
[1:14:57] because it's not coming from within
[1:15:04] praise the lord
[1:15:15] lord be to god
[1:15:19] the fish does not have to worry
[1:15:22] whether the water that is swimming in is
[1:15:25] going to finish
[1:15:27] it don't thinks about it it does not
[1:15:29] even come to the mind of the fish
[1:15:33] praise the lord it does not come to the
[1:15:36] mind of the fish
[1:15:37] fish have never taught one bay to say
[1:15:41] that this water that i'm aiming is is is
[1:15:44] going to
[1:15:44] it's going to drain up one of these day
[1:15:47] i might wake up and there will be no
[1:15:49] water for me to swim
[1:15:55] it does not comes to the intelligence
[1:15:58] of the fish praise the lord
[1:16:02] because there is a lord in that fish
[1:16:06] that tells the fish this is the only
[1:16:09] place that you can live
[1:16:11] right the life you have in you
[1:16:15] is comfortable in this place game only
[1:16:17] exists in this place
[1:16:18] that's why fish do not makes plans with
[1:16:22] their children for them to move in the
[1:16:23] desert
[1:16:26] they don't make plans with their family
[1:16:28] and say let's let's go on lane and leave
[1:16:31] maybe one of these days the water is
[1:16:32] going to dry up
[1:16:35] it don't come to their mind
[1:16:39] why because the lord in them
[1:16:43] drives them it governs them
[1:16:47] to think that this is
[1:16:51] the best place in the world to live
[1:16:58] the law that is in them makes them to be
[1:17:01] so pleased
[1:17:07] are we together
[1:17:10] there is a law in
[1:17:14] everything
[1:17:18] praise the lord there is a lord
[1:17:22] in everything or if if the lord can
[1:17:26] just open our heart
[1:17:30] beyond what a preacher can say
[1:17:34] and just make this so real
[1:17:38] even to the little kids

[1:18:55] you know i don't have to worry about it
[1:18:57] you know i've never used that in my life
[1:18:59] so a conversation came up
[1:19:02] and i saw where they were going so i
[1:19:04] decided to step out of the office and
[1:19:05] talk to them a little bit and
[1:19:08] and i just and and as soon as i i came

[1:19:54] the complexion of other people when they
[1:19:57] are exposed to the sun
[1:19:59] too much it might affect him
[1:20:03] the complexion of other people think
[1:20:05] about people that lives
[1:20:07] close to the equator what is very hot
[1:20:10] they don't use some stream
[1:20:12] now i told them i says but this is
[1:20:15] this is word
[1:20:19] this is where it becomes interesting
[1:20:22] when people that are used
[1:20:26] to hot weather try to
[1:20:29] kill the cells of their body because
[1:20:33] they want to
[1:20:33] change the complexion of their skin and
[1:20:37] become like
[1:20:38] somebody that have a lighter complexion
[1:20:40] that's where they get their cancer from
[1:20:46] because they are breaking the cells on
[1:20:49] their body
[1:20:51] because they don't want the kind of a
[1:20:53] dark color skin like i have
[1:20:55] they want a lighter color scheme that's
[1:20:58] where
[1:20:59] they they develop skin cancer from
[1:21:04] and i mean it was just
[1:21:08] you know it just it's it became so quiet
[1:21:10] just like you are quiet
[1:21:14] and i told him let me step in my office
[1:21:16] i don't want to preach
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:24] but you see i say there to say there is
[1:21:27] a law in
[1:21:30] everything
[1:21:37] there is a law in everything
[1:21:46] glory be to god tonight amy i'm trying
[1:21:50] to hold myself
[1:21:52] because it's a subject i could run with
[1:21:54] tonight but i'm trying my best to hold
[1:21:56] myself you know and then and brother
[1:21:58] branham go on
[1:21:59] and he talks about the face he said if
[1:22:00] he just
[1:22:02] if he if he would just let go of that
[1:22:06] law
[1:22:07] that's in him he
[1:22:10] can sink plumb
[1:22:13] to the bottom of the sea all he has to
[1:22:17] do
[1:22:18] is to allow the law to
[1:22:21] work through his body he just have to
[1:22:24] let go
[1:22:28] let the law that governs him
[1:22:31] get ahold of him it's not him
[1:22:34] controlling the lord
[1:22:36] but let the lord get ahold of him
[1:22:39] or he can go to the bottom of the sea
[1:22:46] praise the lord you cannot tell a fish
[1:22:49] that he would drown
[1:22:52] have you ever heard a fish drown in
[1:22:54] water
[1:23:01] because there is a lord that governs it
[1:23:06] that governs eight
[1:23:10] glory be to god
[1:23:14] that's the same thing with you and
[1:23:15] myself when god called us
[1:23:17] there is a lord and that lord
[1:23:21] is in the new birth
[1:23:26] the lord to live a christ-like
[1:23:30] is in the new birth it does not come
[1:23:32] from a church creed
[1:23:34] or a church doctrine
[1:23:40] praise the lord all if you
[1:23:44] just love the law with all your heart
[1:23:47] all your mind
[1:23:49] all your strength what are you doing
[1:23:52] when you're doing that
[1:23:53] you are letting go so the law
[1:23:57] of redemption will work through you the
[1:24:00] law of liberty will
[1:24:02] set you free
[1:24:07] praise the lord but you see when people
[1:24:10] get to the place
[1:24:11] where uh uh uh it says oh the church
[1:24:14] says this oh i had to do this or as the
[1:24:17] pastor would not be happy
[1:24:18] and all of that you you are stopping the
[1:24:21] law
[1:24:22] from working through you
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:26] you are trying to govern yourself
[1:24:29] by a church creed in a message this is
[1:24:32] the way we do it
[1:24:34] you you are trying to govern yourself
[1:24:43] and when you're trying to govern
[1:24:44] yourself then god step back
[1:24:47] then that law cannot work
[1:24:55] praise the lord you see from the day
[1:24:58] that god said
[1:24:59] let there be light and the bible said he
[1:25:01] put the
[1:25:02] the sun in the heavens to give light to
[1:25:05] the dead in the moon and the star
[1:25:08] god never came back again and stands
[1:25:11] and and says well let me work on them
[1:25:13] you know i
[1:25:14] i have to i have to maintain them i have
[1:25:17] to
[1:25:17] you know know
[1:25:20] everything that would make that son to
[1:25:23] do what god
[1:25:24] wanted to do he place it in the sun
[1:25:27] before he put it out there
[1:25:30] that's the reason why the prophet of god
[1:25:32] can say all you need from your journey
[1:25:35] on earth to glory god has already placed
[1:25:38] it in you
[1:25:44] all my little redeemed needs to be a
[1:25:47] mother is already in her
[1:25:49] even though she's a little girl but
[1:25:51] everything she needs
[1:25:53] she don't get to a certain age and we go
[1:25:55] and shopping for her
[1:25:56] and say well we got to get her an other
[1:25:59] arm now
[1:25:59] you know she's growing we got to change
[1:26:01] her arm and you know and
[1:26:04] it's within her there's a law inside
[1:26:08] as she gets to setting edge the law
[1:26:10] rolls around
[1:26:11] the changes comes
[1:26:29] oh i see why brother branham say if i
[1:26:31] will ever get to my text
[1:26:32] because you can't get to your text on a
[1:26:34] subject like this
[1:26:39] you can get to your text on a soldier
[1:26:42] like this
[1:26:44] there's a lord in everything
[1:26:51] in everything
[1:26:57] if things are not working it's because
[1:27:00] the law
[1:27:01] and not emotion
[1:27:07] amen because the lord and not
[1:27:10] emotion
[1:27:17] if the laws are emotion
[1:27:20] they will work
[1:27:24] things will work
[1:27:27] everything anything
[1:27:30] there is a lord
[1:27:36] praise the lord oh glory to god tonight
[1:27:41] thank you jesus hallelujah
[1:27:46] hallelujah
[1:27:52] we'll come back to that quote let's go
[1:27:53] to uh three council believer he says now
[1:27:56] i was thinking as i look out
[1:28:00] out the window a little a little while
[1:28:03] ago
[1:28:04] and look at the setting of the sun
[1:28:07] and seeing how all nature has
[1:28:10] a law
[1:28:14] praise the lord amen
[1:28:19] i mean uh it just it just i mean we we
[1:28:23] we get so we get so used to seeing it
[1:28:26] that sometimes i mean we don't we don't
[1:28:28] pay attention just
[1:28:29] just few weeks ago all of these trees
[1:28:33] were without leaves
[1:28:36] and everything was dry yes sir
[1:28:41] praise the lord and everything was dry
[1:28:48] but here the leaves begin to come up the
[1:28:52] flowers beginning to grow
[1:28:55] and every word is beginning to look
[1:28:56] green
[1:29:00] because there is a law
[1:29:03] the almighty god himself
[1:29:09] i was just looking through the windows
[1:29:10] and and and looking at
[1:29:12] uh uh you know a little flower bush at
[1:29:15] the back of the house
[1:29:16] there and to realize how how dry it was
[1:29:19] and i was shaving this morning
[1:29:20] as i looked through the way i said wow
[1:29:22] it's growing pretty
[1:29:32] there's a lord that kept the life
[1:29:36] of that little tree
[1:29:39] down
[1:29:43] in the earth until the winter was over
[1:29:52] man if you if you if you just think
[1:29:54] about it you
[1:29:55] think about design
[1:30:00] and wherever you see design there is an
[1:30:04] intelligence
[1:30:08] wherever you see design there is
[1:30:11] an intelligence that is behind it
[1:30:19] the design just don't suffice
[1:30:22] like that no
[1:30:26] it's not a random thing
[1:30:30] the setting of the sun and seeing how
[1:30:32] the nature has a lawn
[1:30:36] and when the winter comes the lord
[1:30:40] automatically all nature
[1:30:44] runs toward the sun down into the around
[1:30:48] the sub
[1:30:48] down into the tree roots
[1:30:52] is is buried as job said
[1:30:56] oh that thou will have me in the grave
[1:30:59] that i will keep me in a secret place
[1:31:02] until they arrive
[1:31:05] be and now that is if thou will hide me
[1:31:10] the nature the tree the life goes down
[1:31:13] in the root
[1:31:14] brother wayne he says
[1:31:17] and they're still until the warm past
[1:31:20] and
[1:31:20] and then call me and and and and
[1:31:24] and set me in a time nature has a law
[1:31:28] there is a lot of nature
[1:31:30] there is a law
[1:31:35] at all to he says he says there is no
[1:31:37] way
[1:31:38] okay that's i love this he says there's
[1:31:40] a law
[1:31:42] nature has a law there is a law to
[1:31:44] nature
[1:31:45] and there is no way at all to
[1:31:48] get around it you can't cheat
[1:31:51] nature you cannot cheat
[1:31:56] nature
[1:31:58] the lord you cannot cheat nature one of
[1:32:01] the biggest question that is that
[1:32:02] always people always ask you know and
[1:32:06] the thing about danger the thing about
[1:32:09] the heart the thing about all of the
[1:32:10] things that is happening
[1:32:11] and they ask why why why there is evil
[1:32:17] why there is evil why evil things happen
[1:32:20] now evil things comes under the law of
[1:32:24] contracts
[1:32:28] praise the lord it comes honor the lord
[1:32:33] of contracts and the lord of contracts
[1:32:36] is you cannot appreciate the good
[1:32:40] until you have the bond
[1:32:44] amen until there is there is uh
[1:32:47] a night you will realize appreciate the
[1:32:52] day
[1:32:55] praise the lord until you experience
[1:32:58] horrible darkness you will really never
[1:33:00] appreciate light
[1:33:02] so that is the law of contracts
[1:33:06] and there are a lot of other things that
[1:33:08] are in a lot of contracts
[1:33:09] conflict it's in the lord of contracts
[1:33:14] why there is conflict
[1:33:19] it's for us to be able to appreciate
[1:33:25] when there is no conflict
[1:33:30] praise the lord you know how it is when
[1:33:33] when uh when you have an ill feeling
[1:33:36] against someone especially
[1:33:37] one time you're on good terms and you
[1:33:39] can talk you can laugh together
[1:33:41] and you start having just because the
[1:33:43] person did something that
[1:33:44] you know that you were not happy about
[1:33:46] or maybe you did some whatever way that
[1:33:49] brought that conflict there is an ill
[1:33:51] feeling that comes
[1:33:53] no matter if you are right or you are
[1:33:55] wrong for the fact that
[1:33:57] you are not talking you feel bad
[1:34:06] praise the lord
[1:34:10] you see so all of the things that is
[1:34:12] happening
[1:34:13] these are the laws that god set
[1:34:16] now people are saying you know if
[1:34:18] there's a god why
[1:34:20] why they are what i mean why why are all
[1:34:22] of these things happening
[1:34:23] it's because god set those law in nature
[1:34:27] right he set those laws in nature
[1:34:32] that when a man is doing evil this is
[1:34:35] what would befall him
[1:34:37] you will reap what you saw it's a lot of
[1:34:39] nature
[1:34:40] you cannot get around it
[1:34:43] you cannot get around the lord
[1:34:47] of nature praise the lord
[1:34:52] amen you are born you're going to grow
[1:34:55] you're going to go through that cycle
[1:34:58] i mean they can fight you know do
[1:35:00] everything and say sir no
[1:35:02] you know i'm this uh this old age i'm
[1:35:04] going to stop it
[1:35:05] i'm going to take this medication i'm
[1:35:07] going to do this you can't get there is
[1:35:09] no way you can bypass nature
[1:35:11] you can cheat it just allow it
[1:35:17] to have its way and that's the way you
[1:35:20] will enjoy it
[1:35:24] that's the way you will enjoy it
[1:35:30] praise the lord people that don't like
[1:35:34] opposition is because you have not
[1:35:36] understood the lord of contracts
[1:35:40] if you don't like opposition you have
[1:35:43] not understood a lot of contracts
[1:35:49] there is a law it's there
[1:35:59] but when you understand when you
[1:36:01] understand
[1:36:02] when you understand the lord that god
[1:36:05] placed it and you and you have
[1:36:07] you have opposition that's the reason
[1:36:09] why people that understand a lot of
[1:36:11] contracts
[1:36:12] they use opposition to strengthen
[1:36:14] themselves
[1:36:18] they take all of the negative energy
[1:36:22] that comes from people
[1:36:23] and they look at themselves and say well
[1:36:25] if they are saying this about me
[1:36:27] then i'd rather do better sure
[1:36:31] instead of flying out why why are you
[1:36:32] saying this about me
[1:36:38] praise the lord
[1:36:45] glory be to god
[1:36:49] you know those things happen around
[1:36:51] family those things happen around church
[1:36:55] praise the lord
[1:36:58] a person leave church and pretty soon
[1:37:00] they they i mean
[1:37:02] people that were nice to one another now
[1:37:04] it becomes enemy to one another
[1:37:06] go into the same heaven but they can't
[1:37:08] talk on earth
[1:37:14] praise the lord go into the same heaven
[1:37:16] but they can't talk on earth
[1:37:23] it's because they have not appreciated
[1:37:26] the law of contracts
[1:37:32] but people that have appreciated a lot
[1:37:34] of contracts
[1:37:36] all they know how to step behind that
[1:37:38] line
[1:37:41] they know how to step behind that line
[1:37:43] and whether the person goes to the same
[1:37:45] church or not
[1:37:46] i mean they they i love you brother
[1:37:50] amen because if i can love you here on
[1:37:52] earth
[1:37:53] what am i going to do how am i going to
[1:37:55] make it
[1:38:02] it's a law
[1:38:06] all of the things that are happening and
[1:38:08] looks like the chaos and
[1:38:09] in sickness coronavirus some people say
[1:38:12] i lost my faith in god because
[1:38:14] coronavirus came over
[1:38:15] you don't understand that it is because
[1:38:19] man seen it is because the
[1:38:22] the evil they have played in god's
[1:38:24] laboratory they are doing all sorts of
[1:38:26] things to the universe
[1:38:27] they bring the evil upon them
[1:38:30] upon themselves it's not god that is
[1:38:32] doing it it's a law that is said that
[1:38:35] when you
[1:38:35] when you move this thing a flood of
[1:38:37] water will enter
[1:38:39] so if you go and move in the water until
[1:38:41] you say oh god why the water enter no
[1:38:43] why did you move it
[1:38:47] why did you move it
[1:38:52] it's just a law
[1:39:00] praise the lord amen
[1:39:03] they gave them the lord and says don't
[1:39:04] smoke in your house
[1:39:08] you go smoke in the house and put a
[1:39:10] secret down and fall and sleep in the
[1:39:12] house caught on fire he said god want my
[1:39:13] house burned
[1:39:14] no why did you smoke
[1:39:18] so it's a lot of contrast
[1:39:22] you don't expect to have
[1:39:26] a good result when you are doing bad
[1:39:28] things
[1:39:36] praise the lord
[1:39:40] people are looking for a god just like
[1:39:42] an
[1:39:43] errand boy that can run to their car
[1:39:45] okay come and do this okay go on come
[1:39:46] and do this holy lord come and do this
[1:39:49] no before he brought you and myself here
[1:39:52] he put law in nature
[1:39:56] that you will reap what you saw the law
[1:40:00] of reproduction the law of redemption
[1:40:04] the lord of contracts he put all of
[1:40:07] those
[1:40:08] laws to govern the universe
[1:40:14] [Laughter]
[1:40:15] automatic god we serve
[1:40:17] [Laughter]
[1:40:19] oh praise the lord glory be to god
[1:40:24] praise the lord god is not a magician
[1:40:26] people
[1:40:27] he's a god of principle he's the creator
[1:40:30] of the heaven and earth
[1:40:37] oh my goodness oh
[1:40:40] man praise the lord
[1:40:44] oh man my goodness
[1:40:55] isaiah says something i was looking at
[1:40:58] isaiah chapter 33 verse 22
[1:41:02] the prophet isaiah says for the lord
[1:41:06] is our george
[1:41:09] the lord is our lord giver
[1:41:14] the lord is our king
[1:41:19] he will save us
[1:41:23] praise the lord amen
[1:41:29] that's what jesus said i've not come to
[1:41:33] destroy the lord
[1:41:37] amen those things that are placed in the
[1:41:40] law
[1:41:43] have come because they were major that's
[1:41:45] coming down
[1:41:46] and more and more to the lord of
[1:41:47] redemption the lord of redemption
[1:41:51] or the old testament hold a shadow of
[1:41:53] the blood of bulls and god
[1:41:57] what adam lost who have never come back
[1:42:00] to the human soul
[1:42:04] so jesus has to come so the lord of
[1:42:08] internal life can roll back
[1:42:13] when he paid the price on cavalry and
[1:42:15] said it is
[1:42:16] finished once again
[1:42:22] the soul of man
[1:42:26] can be able to experience
[1:42:31] what adam had
[1:42:35] what adam had
[1:42:39] we can be able to experience it
[1:42:44] by a down payment a down payment is just
[1:42:48] a little bit
[1:42:49] [Laughter]
[1:42:50] a little of the whole
[1:42:54] that's right bro
[1:42:58] there's a lord
[1:43:01] to everything
[1:43:04] praise the lord
[1:43:10] we'll talk more about it but you want to
[1:43:13] enjoy this subject
[1:43:19] read the message the restoration of the
[1:43:20] bride tree
[1:43:22] you enjoy it praise the lord
[1:43:28] because you know that's what brother
[1:43:30] branham said he says
[1:43:33] the devil he's just a bluff
[1:43:37] amen he's he's just a bluff
[1:43:40] he cannot stop god's law
[1:43:43] what god has put in place
[1:43:46] to work for his children the devil
[1:43:49] cannot stop it
[1:43:50] he cannot stop the law of god what he
[1:43:53] does
[1:43:54] is that he stop the people of god
[1:43:58] from allowing that lord to work through
[1:44:01] them
[1:44:04] because when he keeps pointing you to
[1:44:06] your arrow
[1:44:07] and you cannot look at your sacrifice
[1:44:10] there is no way the law
[1:44:12] of cleansing redemption and healing will
[1:44:19] that's work that's right
[1:44:23] because the word that the law of healing
[1:44:26] is look
[1:44:26] and leave yes look at life
[1:44:30] now all you have to do look at your
[1:44:32] sacrifice
[1:44:33] accept what god has done for you is now
[1:44:36] what you can do
[1:44:39] it's not how loyal you become to a
[1:44:41] church or how loyal you become
[1:44:43] to to any organization is
[1:44:46] looking and believing what god has done
[1:44:49] for you
[1:44:50] but the devil will not allow us to do
[1:44:52] that he will keep pointing us to error
[1:44:54] in our lives
[1:44:55] you see what they have done you see what
[1:44:57] they say you see what you are doing
[1:44:59] so all of those things
[1:45:02] stop the law of god
[1:45:07] from working in a believer
[1:45:11] because we want to make it happen no
[1:45:15] no he has already made it happen
[1:45:20] with him is a finnish work he has
[1:45:23] already made it happen
[1:45:29] oh just forgive me i'm not your
[1:45:31] traditional message preacher
[1:45:34] just forgive me
[1:45:40] glory be to god amen
[1:45:43] oh i believe that god sent us a prophet
[1:45:46] amen and i believe that that prophet
[1:45:50] brought us such a word
[1:45:54] such a word yes such a word
[1:46:01] he brought us such a word
[1:46:05] verbally will explain
[1:46:08] that the discernment all of the things
[1:46:10] he was doing is
[1:46:12] is just by obeying the law of god
[1:46:15] sure getting out of the way
[1:46:18] and let christ come that all he was
[1:46:24] doing
[1:46:27] he was just obeying the law of faith
[1:46:29] that's all
[1:46:33] but we become so technical in our mind
[1:46:36] we become so complicated
[1:46:37] this has to be this way and you got to
[1:46:39] bring it back this way no you gotta
[1:46:41] you're and when we finish explaining it
[1:46:45] then we confused what did i just said
[1:46:52] sure
[1:46:58] no you got to say it this way he said in
[1:47:00] 1963. oh no no 1962. he said
[1:47:20] um
[1:47:23] i mean you are not hot you're not you're
[1:47:25] not really blasting your sinks
[1:47:27] you're not blasting let's let's blast it
[1:47:28] let it leave
[1:47:31] let's blast it show me how to blast it
[1:47:38] you just gotta align the word and drive
[1:47:41] the people
[1:47:42] faith into it and let them fall in love
[1:47:46] with god
[1:47:48] and let them fall in love with god
[1:47:58] hallelujah
[1:48:01] oh my
[1:48:05] oh praise the lord thank you jesus
[1:48:08] i just love you father
[1:48:19] oh man
[1:48:23] praise the lord i'm just i'm just
[1:48:26] getting over
[1:48:27] just touching some highlights here we
[1:48:29] will we will look at this
[1:48:31] a little more on sunday by the grace of
[1:48:33] god
[1:48:34] they have a pressing water from the rock
[1:48:37] listen to what he says he says
[1:48:40] there is some law
[1:48:44] there is a law of nature
[1:48:48] some intelligence set this
[1:48:51] law in order
[1:48:54] not only that but that same
[1:48:57] intelligence has to
[1:49:00] operate
[1:49:06] the intelligence that said it in order
[1:49:10] is behind it to make sure
[1:49:14] now one jot all one
[1:49:17] tether that's right
[1:49:21] we break from god's word the
[1:49:24] intelligence
[1:49:25] that says you be your brian that you are
[1:49:28] a bride
[1:49:30] god has already set emotion
[1:49:33] that's why brother branham says walk in
[1:49:36] the light
[1:49:39] walk in the light just keep loving the
[1:49:42] lord
[1:49:43] keep loving him keep praising him keep
[1:49:45] doing what is right
[1:49:47] you will see your sinful nature just for
[1:49:49] them
[1:49:52] is it will just fall down things you are
[1:49:55] struggling with
[1:50:01] we just go yeah
[1:50:07] another young rich ruler came to jesus
[1:50:09] he says how can i have eternal life
[1:50:12] good master praise the lord
[1:50:21] jesus said
[1:50:25] sell all you have
[1:50:29] and give to the poor praise the lord
[1:50:34] amen now you realize
[1:50:37] that in the conversation
[1:50:40] jesus identified something of the gr
[1:50:44] of the young rich ruler he had
[1:50:48] a problem an inner problem and his inner
[1:50:50] problem was he had a great possession
[1:50:54] the possession was not outward
[1:50:56] possession
[1:50:57] it was inward possession
[1:51:01] praise the lord amen
[1:51:04] he had an inward possession
[1:51:08] that that was
[1:51:11] that that was stopping him or in one
[1:51:13] sense that he was kind of a struggling
[1:51:18] wave
[1:51:20] to be able to trust god
[1:51:25] because he has put all his confidence
[1:51:29] in his wealth as a young man he has
[1:51:33] worked so hard he has saved money
[1:51:35] and he have done all that i mean he have
[1:51:37] built this company and he built that
[1:51:39] and all his mind was in that right
[1:51:45] praise the lord
[1:51:48] amen so it was more
[1:51:52] it was more a spiritual possession he
[1:51:55] had
[1:51:56] than the physical possession because
[1:51:58] jesus told his disciple
[1:52:00] because you have left everything that
[1:52:01] 104 will be given to you
[1:52:04] in in this world in the world to come
[1:52:07] so jesus never preached a a a
[1:52:11] a a poverty message to strip his people
[1:52:14] from everything
[1:52:17] but he said seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:52:20] god
[1:52:23] when you get the kingdom of god within
[1:52:25] you
[1:52:27] then every other thing will be added
[1:52:33] are we together but if you don't have
[1:52:36] the kingdom within you you can you you
[1:52:38] cannot even have it without
[1:52:41] you can have a kingdom without if you
[1:52:43] don't have a kingdom within
[1:52:46] you have to first have a kingdom with
[1:52:48] him there's a lord
[1:52:50] that governs everything
[1:52:56] there's a law that governs everything
[1:53:00] and there is an intelligence behind that
[1:53:04] lord
[1:53:07] praise the lord
[1:53:11] are we together
[1:53:24] there's a lot in nature and there is no
[1:53:26] way you no way at
[1:53:28] all to get around it you cannot escape
[1:53:31] it we can we can take each of those laws
[1:53:34] the law of reproduction
[1:53:38] the lord of sowing and reaping
[1:53:42] talk a little bit about the lord of
[1:53:43] contracts
[1:53:46] if you just understand that if you just
[1:53:49] if you just understand that that that
[1:53:52] was the intelligence behind the book of
[1:53:54] job
[1:54:00] praise the lord
[1:54:04] because you have to get the good see the
[1:54:08] bad for you to appreciate the good
[1:54:13] god bless you like that praise the lord
[1:54:17] amen amen can you just think about it
[1:54:22] almighty god he built and eaten
[1:54:25] where his son was in his expression
[1:54:29] and adam could speak just like god and
[1:54:31] everything he
[1:54:32] you know he was god governing everything
[1:54:36] and then suddenly it looks like
[1:54:38] everything just
[1:54:39] went crazy
[1:54:42] praise the lord adam was not home one
[1:54:45] bed
[1:54:46] and and and when he looks he realized
[1:54:48] that the animals are fussing down there
[1:54:51] and and uh uh you know and this animal
[1:54:54] is running from this place i mean there
[1:54:56] was just there was just
[1:54:57] chaos in the garden of eden
[1:55:00] chaos he lost control he could not even
[1:55:04] call the animals by he could not even
[1:55:06] speak peace and everything just running
[1:55:08] upside down
[1:55:08] he's like oh my goodness what is going
[1:55:10] on let me get home to see eve
[1:55:14] when he got home he could tell from her
[1:55:16] face that something
[1:55:18] went wrong
[1:55:22] he could tell from her face that
[1:55:25] something
[1:55:25] went wrong
[1:55:30] she broke a law
[1:55:38] everything was governed everything was
[1:55:41] in place everything was peaceful but
[1:55:46] when she broke it lord
[1:55:48] everything just cattle now they cannot
[1:55:51] get in control of it anymore
[1:55:54] praise the lord
[1:55:58] you see that's that's the reason why
[1:56:00] paul speaks about that in the book of
[1:56:02] romans
[1:56:05] church that's a higher power adam never
[1:56:08] took
[1:56:09] no time to argue with eve
[1:56:13] because you have to realize he was in
[1:56:17] he was stay in the state of innocence
[1:56:20] he had never fussed before
[1:56:24] he he did not have the ability to fuss
[1:56:26] with eve and says what have you done
[1:56:28] see what you have done look look at
[1:56:29] everything
[1:56:31] he had not dropped down yet
[1:56:34] so he never fussed with eve he was just
[1:56:38] looking right
[1:56:40] and looking left he knew something has
[1:56:43] happened
[1:56:46] and he had to do something if he don't
[1:56:49] do it
[1:56:51] he's going to lost everything
[1:56:57] he didn't argue with eve
[1:57:00] okay come come tell me what you did you
[1:57:02] really gotta tell me tell me in details
[1:57:06] there was no time for that
[1:57:10] while we were yet sinners
[1:57:14] christ jesus took our place he stepped
[1:57:18] right in there
[1:57:24] after he took her place and redeemed her
[1:57:29] before he gained consciousness of what
[1:57:30] he had done
[1:57:34] after he took her place and redeemed her
[1:57:39] my goodness that's the reason why the
[1:57:41] scripture
[1:57:42] give the outstanding man love your wife
[1:57:44] just like christ
[1:57:51] what a place
[1:57:56] glory be to god glory be to god
[1:58:08] it's almost 9 30 a.m
[1:58:11] i have to stop
[1:58:17] musicians you can come think about the
[1:58:20] church
[1:58:26] a lord was broken
[1:58:30] now you think about it this way
[1:58:34] if it was just only
[1:58:38] for the fact that eve
[1:58:42] broke a commandment
[1:58:45] if he was only at the place where she
[1:58:48] did
[1:58:48] something that displeased god
[1:58:53] god alone was going to be angry with her
[1:58:58] but what she did
[1:59:02] it took a whole from
[1:59:05] the creation
[1:59:10] something in the law that was governing
[1:59:13] peace
[1:59:14] was taken out
[1:59:19] you see that's the reason why
[1:59:22] when young people in a family structure
[1:59:27] i'm going to do whatever i want to do i
[1:59:29] know i don't care what anybody says
[1:59:34] you are so consumed with yourself
[1:59:37] you are so consumed with yourself
[1:59:40] [Music]
[1:59:41] in a family life
[1:59:44] [Music]
[1:59:46] but that one action that one
[1:59:50] action
[1:59:54] is going to
[1:59:58] move many things from a part
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:05] praise the lord
[2:00:13] you think about a family that don't have
[2:00:15] a lot of money
[2:00:18] they are not rich like the people in
[2:00:20] this world
[2:00:23] but they just love god and they learn to
[2:00:26] love one another and they learn to
[2:00:27] respect one another and support one
[2:00:29] another
[2:00:31] [Music]
[2:00:34] that home become the happiest place on
[2:00:38] earth
[2:00:42] it become the most peaceful place on
[2:00:44] earth
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:50] they cannot wait to get home
[2:00:55] because they have set a law of god in
[2:00:58] their home
[2:00:59] to love one another to support one
[2:01:02] another
[2:01:04] and that law has created an atmosphere
[2:01:07] in their home
[2:01:08] that they cannot wait to get home there
[2:01:11] is there is just this anxiousness to get
[2:01:13] home
[2:01:19] but that very same home
[2:01:23] if the law that god has given to
[2:01:26] governor home is not in their home
[2:01:29] or you can put thousands of dollars
[2:01:31] there they're going to kill one another
[2:01:33] they will spill their own their own
[2:01:35] blood
[2:01:37] and they will leave the money and die
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:52] there is a law to everything
[2:01:57] there's a law to happiness
[2:02:03] there's a law to happiness
[2:02:06] every lord is within you
[2:02:11] you don't look for happiness from
[2:02:13] outside
[2:02:15] happiness comes from within
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:37] oh may god help us tonight let's just
[2:02:40] sing that song with the musicians
[2:02:45] oh love of god
[2:03:12] a strong
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:40] yes
[2:03:42] love of god
[2:04:07] as strong
