[51:31] he saw a man which was blind from his
[51:35] birth
[51:37] and his disciples asked him

[51:43] who did Sin
[51:45] this man
[51:47] or his parents
[51:49] that he was born blind
[51:53] Jesus answered

[54:51] we had a wonderful wonderful world
[54:54] service on the 30th
[54:58] of December turned out to be a
[55:00] wonderful prayer meeting
[55:03] and from the result of that and and to
[55:09] see how many of you
[55:12] testified of how much it was a blessing
[55:14] to you
[55:17] we thought that sometime during the
[55:20] Spring we would like to have something
[55:22] like that
[55:23] we will work out the day and let you
[55:26] know
[55:27] and
[55:30] so you can be able to plan your schedule
[55:34] or time towards that
[55:37] we'll see how how the rest of
[55:42] the the year we go until we get to that
[55:45] place tonight I want to speak on
[55:47] something a little taught
[55:50] away from what we've been talking about
[55:52] uh
[55:55] exceeding righteousness I want to speak
[55:58] just a little talk tonight on for this
[56:02] prayer meeting on God's purpose
[56:05] God has a purpose for our lives amen
[56:09] he has a purpose for for each and every
[56:12] one of us
[56:13] and that's the reason why he expressed
[56:16] us
[56:16] in a time that
[56:20] we are expressed the age the year we
[56:23] were born the family we were born in in
[56:27] uh
[56:28] God have a purpose for all of them
[56:31] praise the Lord amen and and just in
[56:36] this story tonight
[56:39] IFA the
[56:45] if the team back there has has been able
[56:48] to pull that up I just wanted to read
[56:50] these few things uh for the prayer
[56:52] meeting tonight you know the real
[56:54] Christian way
[56:55] is so hard things
[56:57] you can from a brother and we see also
[57:01] from his sister don't tell his bad
[57:03] things just tell his good things just
[57:06] tell what you know about him there's
[57:09] good if any if anything bad let alone
[57:11] the poor fellow got enough against him
[57:15] anyhow
[57:16] don't try to take the pull and shove the
[57:19] man father
[57:21] into the Dage the Christian attitude is
[57:24] to pick him up and take him out of the
[57:28] ditch
[57:29] amen
[57:30] see don't never try to shove him down
[57:34] he's down already
[57:37] try to help him out
[57:39] or help him out now for instance if one
[57:43] of you brethrens will make a mistake or
[57:45] do something wrong which you are subject
[57:48] to I'm subject to every one of us but as
[57:52] we go along let's remember we are
[57:54] brothers
[57:55] amen
[57:57] we are brothers
[58:01] now now so uh uh I was reading here from
[58:07] taking science with Jesus if you want to
[58:09] look into that
[58:11] and and what I'm what I'm going to look
[58:14] at tonight is also from there I thought
[58:16] I was just thinking about base uh the
[58:19] thought kind of across my mind
[58:21] and this uh uh subject here where Jesus
[58:26] is faced with his disciples now you will
[58:29] realize that uh even from the very
[58:32] approach of their question it will be
[58:36] the way that the church taught them
[58:39] the way they were taught the way they
[58:41] want us to uh that kind of a situation A
[58:46] man born blind uh the way they were
[58:49] taught was that
[58:51] it was it was because of sin
[58:54] and definitely it is truth it is because
[58:57] of sin that we have sickness we have you
[59:01] know uh uh
[59:04] problems and we have everything seen
[59:07] start the board of evil rolling upon the
[59:10] face of the Earth but you have to
[59:11] realize that before there was sin and
[59:15] there was uh uh God had a purpose God
[59:19] had a plan he had a thought in his mind
[59:22] now so we're going to see how our lord
[59:25] Jesus approached this subject when he
[59:29] was asked on the the health condition of
[59:32] this man
[59:34] praise the Lord
[59:36] you will see that even under the Lord uh
[59:41] uh
[59:43] any form of deformative that was was uh
[59:47] there was there was a kind of a ill
[59:50] feeling you know a sense of hatred that
[59:53] the people have towards it you know if a
[59:56] person will have their own child born
[59:58] that way you know they will they will
[1:00:01] they would just feel so bad you know and
[1:00:03] and and for some reason it was almost
[1:00:07] like a child that was born that way was
[1:00:12] exposing some kind of evil around the
[1:00:16] family or evil around the home
[1:00:19] and uh we we we thank God for for
[1:00:23] medical science uh that I would believe
[1:00:26] that God has used to to to kind of
[1:00:29] change some of those ways that people
[1:00:32] will think about but uh in in some part
[1:00:36] of the word and even in some other
[1:00:39] religion when when when children are
[1:00:42] born there way or people you know will
[1:00:45] turn out to be handicapped or disabled
[1:00:49] is is a big form of curse
[1:00:54] but we will see that our lord Jesus had
[1:00:57] a completely different way that he
[1:00:59] looked at it
[1:01:01] a complete different way
[1:01:04] when the question was asked he said
[1:01:06] neither have this man seen
[1:01:09] non-hispering
[1:01:11] but that the works of God
[1:01:14] should be May manifest
[1:01:17] in him
[1:01:20] praise the Lord now so you take that man
[1:01:23] out of the picture we don't know him by
[1:01:25] name we have never seen his picture
[1:01:27] we don't know him we just only read him
[1:01:30] but take him from the picture and put
[1:01:31] yourself in the picture tonight
[1:01:36] praise the Lord that's what I want for
[1:01:38] us to do take him from the picture and
[1:01:41] put yourself in a picture whatever might
[1:01:44] be your struggle whatever might be your
[1:01:46] weakness whatever my looks like uh uh uh
[1:01:51] you know
[1:01:53] deformative in your life or a sense of
[1:01:56] handicap things that you can do whatever
[1:01:58] it is I want for us to be able to
[1:02:02] realize tonight that God in God's Great
[1:02:06] design
[1:02:08] he uh he allowed that
[1:02:12] so
[1:02:13] his work
[1:02:16] could be made manifest
[1:02:19] in your situation
[1:02:24] praise the Lord
[1:02:27] and uh
[1:02:30] this half of it it has a very big
[1:02:33] picture here let's let's look at a
[1:02:35] little thing that uh you know bird brand
[1:02:38] will say it around this
[1:02:41] [Music]
[1:02:44] now when you when you when you read the
[1:02:46] entire story or you read the chapter
[1:02:48] before you get there you will realize
[1:02:51] that because he's going to bring out
[1:02:53] something here you'll realize that uh uh
[1:02:57] you know just like I said I don't know
[1:02:59] whether it was it's gone Sunday or
[1:03:01] another time every religion every
[1:03:03] religion has been able to uh you know
[1:03:08] they they have written down laws and
[1:03:10] rules and things you know they are
[1:03:13] conformed to their religion of how a man
[1:03:16] can please God what a man needs to do to
[1:03:19] please God what he need to do for God to
[1:03:22] be pleasing with him of God to accept
[1:03:24] him
[1:03:26] Christianity is the only religion that
[1:03:28] says You must Come Just As You Are
[1:03:32] praise the Lord amen
[1:03:34] we are the ones in the different form of
[1:03:37] denominations and different form of
[1:03:39] teaching that have tried to be able to
[1:03:42] create things for ourselves and our our
[1:03:45] doctrines to think that these are the
[1:03:48] things that we need to do for us to be
[1:03:51] accepted no
[1:03:52] praise the Lord amen Jesus says he there
[1:03:57] are living in heaven letting letting
[1:03:59] come and I will give him rest
[1:04:04] praise the Lord and uh
[1:04:08] that's that is a great great thing there
[1:04:11] the Lord has offered us that we can come
[1:04:13] just as we are amen and the reason why
[1:04:17] he wants us to come just as we are is
[1:04:20] for this very same purpose
[1:04:23] amen there are four hits for this very
[1:04:27] same purpose that the work of God will
[1:04:29] be May manifest in our life in our
[1:04:32] situation
[1:04:33] that the work of God will be May
[1:04:36] manifest just in the way that we will
[1:04:39] come to him
[1:04:43] praise the Lord
[1:04:44] amen a beautiful story that we can see
[1:04:47] even in creation we took that uh when we
[1:04:51] were talking about uh
[1:04:53] richer situation and the Patriots wife
[1:04:57] why God had to allow baroness in their
[1:05:00] state but even in you know God writing
[1:05:05] his holy spirit from the very beginning
[1:05:07] he make us to see that uh uh he he
[1:05:12] approached the Earth in a way that uh it
[1:05:17] was in darkness and you know just just
[1:05:19] like it just like a disorder you know
[1:05:21] just like chaos was it was upon the
[1:05:23] Earth
[1:05:24] and he took there from their state
[1:05:28] and where he was able to make a creation
[1:05:30] and out of that creation he brought a
[1:05:34] Garden of Eden
[1:05:35] praise the Lord
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:39] he uh make us to see the Earth you know
[1:05:43] the beginning the beginning of the
[1:05:45] creation of the word that the scripture
[1:05:47] gave us an account of he make us to see
[1:05:50] it you know there's a whole lot of
[1:05:52] things that is hidden right in that
[1:05:54] first verse in the beginning God created
[1:05:56] the Heaven and the Earth there's a whole
[1:05:58] lot of things that God hid right in
[1:06:01] there but then he went out again and
[1:06:03] expressed you know there was no uh light
[1:06:07] there were water all over the Earth and
[1:06:09] all of that and then he came forth and
[1:06:13] made his work to be manifest he started
[1:06:16] working right from him meeting the Earth
[1:06:19] in that condition to be able to bring
[1:06:22] the Earth to a place where their life
[1:06:24] was coming upon the Earth and he created
[1:06:27] the trees he created and at the end he
[1:06:30] created a man in His image
[1:06:33] that the work of God will be May
[1:06:35] manifest in the Earth
[1:06:37] he allowed the Earth give us a record of
[1:06:42] the beginning of the Earth being in
[1:06:44] chaos that is a big picture big very big
[1:06:47] picture in our in in that we are looking
[1:06:50] at tonight
[1:06:52] but let's read this together
[1:06:58] praise the Lord
[1:07:00] now you see before before we get to this
[1:07:02] uh because that is pretty much the only
[1:07:05] thing we read tonight
[1:07:07] you will see the other when Jesus came
[1:07:13] the way he was
[1:07:16] carrying out his ministry and living his
[1:07:19] life and associating with the people was
[1:07:22] completely contrary to the the uh the
[1:07:26] religious group of that day
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:30] but what was was uh uh conflicting here
[1:07:35] for them is that they could see his work
[1:07:40] remain there are even naked demons a
[1:07:43] teacher of the Lord who says we know
[1:07:46] he's saying we we in the sahindrance
[1:07:49] council know that no man can do these
[1:07:52] things
[1:07:54] except they came from God
[1:07:57] praise the Lord
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] so they could see his work
[1:08:03] but also his his manner of life the way
[1:08:06] he was carrying our things and
[1:08:09] associating himself with the Publican
[1:08:11] Sinners and all of that it was difficult
[1:08:15] for them to bring it together why
[1:08:16] because the religious group of that they
[1:08:19] have already set up a standard
[1:08:23] okay they have set up a standard how you
[1:08:26] know uh they believe that uh uh uh that
[1:08:31] that that was that was the way that God
[1:08:33] would accept the way they should dress
[1:08:35] the way that you work and all of that so
[1:08:38] Jesus coming and then and they're seeing
[1:08:41] the things that he have done for how
[1:08:43] many years they have never had a prophet
[1:08:46] on the scene but here is a man yeah
[1:08:49] who's very work you know he's uh he's
[1:08:52] healing the the sake he's raising the
[1:08:54] dead and in all of the things that he's
[1:08:57] doing but yet uh his his uh his manner
[1:09:01] of life you know was he was not just
[1:09:04] following you know uh the the Traditions
[1:09:08] that they have they have set up so what
[1:09:10] they were doing now is that these
[1:09:13] Pharisees they were finding a way to be
[1:09:15] able to put dent on his ministry
[1:09:20] amen I said why why why why why will
[1:09:24] your disciples pluck on on the Sabbath
[1:09:27] day
[1:09:28] praise the Lord if you are really a man
[1:09:31] of God you I mean you were you were
[1:09:33] going to tell these disciples to respect
[1:09:36] the Sabbath
[1:09:40] and when they talk like that they talk
[1:09:42] very loud just to be able to grab the
[1:09:45] attention of the people
[1:09:48] because the religious group of that
[1:09:50] there is not approving its Ministry
[1:09:54] you're not saying that this is the
[1:09:56] messiah
[1:09:59] praise the Lord
[1:10:03] so every time Jesus will remove and he
[1:10:06] would do something uh uh uh uh I mean
[1:10:09] there was a man you know banned uh to
[1:10:13] his bed for 38 years and and they were
[1:10:16] all there at the pool of Solomon Jesus
[1:10:18] come and say pack your bag and go home
[1:10:21] praise the Lord they never rejoice in
[1:10:24] the fact that this man that was that was
[1:10:27] you know the Bound by this sickness for
[1:10:29] all of these years now he's on his feet
[1:10:32] they never rejoice in that fat they
[1:10:35] complained there why you have to do it
[1:10:38] on the Sabbath day
[1:10:45] praise the Lord
[1:10:49] there should be something that should
[1:10:51] make uh any mortar whether the man is
[1:10:54] religious or now what are he no God on
[1:10:57] that to see a poor suffering man back to
[1:11:00] good health
[1:11:02] it should make anybody happy
[1:11:06] but you see that's the danger of
[1:11:08] religion
[1:11:11] that's the danger of religion that's the
[1:11:14] curse of religion
[1:11:17] praise the Lord
[1:11:19] so I sit there so you can be able to get
[1:11:21] a picture of what I will read here now
[1:11:22] those who believe the word
[1:11:30] those who believe the word and know that
[1:11:32] the the very thing that Jesus was doing
[1:11:36] and the thing was of his life they knew
[1:11:41] who he was so they couldn't put nothing
[1:11:44] blamed on him because they couldn't see
[1:11:48] it they know it
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:54] love is blind and Hound
[1:11:56] to them things law of cover the
[1:12:00] multitude of sin you know perfect love
[1:12:02] casts our fear
[1:12:04] and sin
[1:12:06] all discussed love does there now this
[1:12:10] blind man was sitting there in Jesus and
[1:12:14] his disciple come by and I Think Jesus
[1:12:18] give them a little lesson here that's
[1:12:21] what I want us to to pay attention to
[1:12:23] that little lesson
[1:12:25] when Jesus I mean when when they seen
[1:12:28] this poor blind man they taught well
[1:12:31] now surely
[1:12:33] there's a sin behind that somewhere
[1:12:39] praise the Lord amen just seeing his
[1:12:42] condition
[1:12:44] all in your mind there should be a sin
[1:12:47] problem here there should be a reason
[1:12:49] why
[1:12:55] when we see something happen to a man we
[1:12:58] always say well
[1:13:00] he seen he got out of the way of the
[1:13:03] Lord somewhere
[1:13:07] that's not exactly right no sir
[1:13:11] it is seen God permit those things
[1:13:16] Jesus turned around and taught them a
[1:13:19] lesson
[1:13:24] praise the Lord
[1:13:29] and what was the lesson is that uh our
[1:13:32] life on Earth
[1:13:35] have a designer
[1:13:40] praise the Lord
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:44] I'm sure that uh
[1:13:51] the clothes you are wearing you know
[1:13:53] they all would put the attack behind it
[1:13:55] to let you know who is the faction
[1:13:58] designer that make this shirt that you
[1:14:00] are wearing
[1:14:02] praise the Lord
[1:14:04] our life
[1:14:07] the situation we find ourselves in
[1:14:10] and the things that happen around us
[1:14:14] it's not by accident
[1:14:19] praise the Lord
[1:14:21] amen it's now by accident
[1:14:25] and we will and we will only
[1:14:27] appreciate it we only appreciate those
[1:14:31] things
[1:14:31] when we come to understand
[1:14:34] that
[1:14:37] our maker is our designer
[1:14:43] praise the Lord
[1:14:45] that our maker is our designer God
[1:14:48] permit those things Jesus turned around
[1:14:49] and taught them a lesson they said his
[1:14:52] father must have seen or his mother
[1:14:55] Jesus said neither of them sin
[1:14:58] but that the works of God might be May
[1:15:01] manifest
[1:15:03] see God let things happen just so for
[1:15:07] the works of God to be made manifest
[1:15:11] God allow things
[1:15:15] praise the Lord
[1:15:16] and and and and that is the thing word
[1:15:19] our human Minds struggle with
[1:15:23] why because we are finished we are
[1:15:26] limited
[1:15:27] we want to know what is happening right
[1:15:30] now you might have plans for tomorrow
[1:15:32] you might have plans or whatever you
[1:15:34] want to do after the service but what
[1:15:36] you know and you are conscious of is
[1:15:39] what is taking place right now
[1:15:46] praise the Lord that's how much we are
[1:15:48] limited but the god that we serve is the
[1:15:52] great Fountain of all wisdom
[1:15:55] he knows the end from the beginning
[1:16:02] and he designed Our Lives
[1:16:06] praise the Lord he designed the things
[1:16:10] that we will go through
[1:16:18] praise the Lord
[1:16:21] we can join the Apostle Paul tonight to
[1:16:24] say all things work together
[1:16:27] for the good
[1:16:30] today the law of the Lord
[1:16:33] their statement will make
[1:16:36] no more sense to you unless you realize
[1:16:39] that he's the designer of Our Lives
[1:16:44] and the reason why he did it so his work
[1:16:48] will be made manifest
[1:16:52] praise the Lord
[1:16:54] but here is the fake who's I'll soon let
[1:16:57] you go tonight here is the thing here is
[1:17:00] that uh

[1:17:34] brought like I've always said into
[1:17:36] partnership
[1:17:39] okay we are brought into partnership

[1:18:06] and then when he hired you he make you a
[1:18:10] manager
[1:18:12] hmm

[1:18:44] things that happen right down through
[1:18:47] your life

[1:19:17] so now God wants he's taking us on a
[1:19:20] journey
[1:19:21] he's taking us on a journey for us to be
[1:19:24] able to see the purpose
[1:19:28] for us to be able to see and appreciate
[1:19:34] why
[1:19:36] he took us through all of this journey
[1:19:38] all of these things that have taken
[1:19:40] place in our life
[1:19:43] with God principle of a wave shave
[1:19:47] the first fruit
[1:19:50] will be wave before the Harvest to prove
[1:19:52] that there are many more Seas who come
[1:19:54] with that principle
[1:19:56] God will use uh uh the life of men
[1:20:00] through down through the time and for
[1:20:02] our age use broad Branham
[1:20:06] and that was what the Angels said to him
[1:20:09] I'm sent from the presence of God
[1:20:12] to tell you
[1:20:15] about your mysterious life
[1:20:21] praise the Lord
[1:20:23] to tell you
[1:20:26] why you were born in the house of a
[1:20:29] drunker
[1:20:33] to tell you
[1:20:35] why
[1:20:37] you were born in a poor family
[1:20:43] praise the Lord
[1:20:46] glory be to God
[1:20:49] Jesus said it was not his mother it was
[1:20:52] not his father
[1:20:55] but that the work of God
[1:20:58] will be manifest
[1:21:00] in his life
[1:21:04] can you imagine
[1:21:07] a baby being born blind
[1:21:11] can you imagine
[1:21:13] everything that he missed
[1:21:19] being the child
[1:21:24] can you imagine that
[1:21:27] everything that he missed
[1:21:30] being a child
[1:21:35] he couldn't enjoy his friends
[1:21:37] because he's born blind
[1:21:45] praise the Lord
[1:21:51] he couldn't play
[1:21:53] you know they always treat him different
[1:21:55] they always thought about him different
[1:22:01] and here is this little child struggling
[1:22:04] in his mind
[1:22:06] even hating the day that he was born
[1:22:11] praise the Lord
[1:22:14] what what is what is the need of me
[1:22:16] being born I can't even see the sun
[1:22:20] I can't see color
[1:22:24] I'm hearing voices of people all around
[1:22:26] I can't even identify who are those
[1:22:27] people
[1:22:28] right
[1:22:34] praise the Lord you know it is good to
[1:22:36] talk about stories
[1:22:38] and read books about other people
[1:22:41] sometimes we feel sorry for them
[1:22:44] sometimes we enjoy their lives
[1:22:48] but then when it comes to us
[1:22:53] when we bring that home
[1:23:00] praise the Lord
[1:23:03] Jesus teaching them a lesson
[1:23:09] and when you look through the Bible you
[1:23:11] see that over and over and over again
[1:23:15] praise the Lord you see that over and
[1:23:17] over
[1:23:18] he's talking to a brother and then we
[1:23:20] were just talking fellowshipping a
[1:23:22] little bit and and uh
[1:23:26] I said so you think about Jesus
[1:23:30] you know telling his disciples and he's
[1:23:33] he made a story he had a parable
[1:23:36] whatever way we can call it yet and he
[1:23:38] says you know this man was in so much
[1:23:41] debt you know uh and then the king the
[1:23:46] lord of the land was going to to
[1:23:48] imprison him
[1:23:50] and he was backing he says you know you
[1:23:53] know I think about my children you know
[1:23:55] think about my wife and and the lord of
[1:23:58] the Lamb forgive him
[1:24:00] praise the Lord
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:03] and then when he stepped out of the
[1:24:05] courtyard he went by then uh you know I
[1:24:09] I would not want to believe that that
[1:24:11] was just uh immediately sometimes we
[1:24:14] make it to seems like it was immediate
[1:24:16] so now he get out he sought another man
[1:24:18] and said come and pay me
[1:24:20] praise the Lord and I believe humanly
[1:24:23] that God going out of that side of the
[1:24:25] King was just was just in some sense uh
[1:24:28] you know being grateful that his life
[1:24:31] was spared
[1:24:33] but Jesus in that picture was trying to
[1:24:36] show how finite we are how limited we
[1:24:39] are
[1:24:40] how quick we can forget
[1:24:48] praise the Lord
[1:24:50] how limited we are
[1:24:53] and that we need the grace of God
[1:24:57] we need the grace of God
[1:25:00] praise the Lord
[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:03] that we need the grace of God
[1:25:06] and that's why I was thinking about this
[1:25:07] tonight I've you know I've got away from
[1:25:09] what I wanted to preach talk that we'll
[1:25:12] have a prayer meeting tonight so I was I
[1:25:14] just I just took this thought on my mind
[1:25:16] thinking about God's purpose
[1:25:22] for our life
[1:25:25] and you see it as we journey on this
[1:25:27] Earth
[1:25:29] that's all
[1:25:32] you know
[1:25:34] we will get to to know that's all we
[1:25:36] will get to discover
[1:25:38] As We join in on this Earth
[1:25:41] as the years go by and the different
[1:25:43] experiences we have in our life
[1:25:47] be looking to see God's purpose
[1:25:50] and you see the thing there you know
[1:25:52] like brother Branham says here he says
[1:25:54] that uh uh the elite that's what he
[1:25:58] meant when he says Love is Blind in a
[1:26:00] way he means that uh uh there were there
[1:26:03] were these people that that identified
[1:26:07] Jesus ministry by the scripture
[1:26:12] praise the Lord the new by the scripture
[1:26:15] this is what the the prophet said they
[1:26:17] were able to put his life and his
[1:26:19] ministry in the scripture so no matter
[1:26:22] what the Pharisees were saying about him
[1:26:24] it did not bother them
[1:26:29] praise the Lord
[1:26:30] no matter what the Pharisees were saying
[1:26:33] you know uh uh and when you read the
[1:26:36] rest of the story there you know they
[1:26:38] came and intimidated the the young man
[1:26:40] mother and parents he says you come here
[1:26:43] you know this is your child you tell us
[1:26:45] how did this happen you know in all of
[1:26:48] them just just you know to be able to
[1:26:51] save your life and their reputation this
[1:26:53] is why he's of age you asking
[1:26:56] you know they go to the man you know
[1:26:58] there are you know what uh this this
[1:27:00] thing must must be of the devil you know
[1:27:02] he says uh you know I was not seen
[1:27:05] before you were seen
[1:27:07] you were the one that was seeing I was
[1:27:09] not seeing have you ever seen a man
[1:27:13] bomb blind
[1:27:14] yeah
[1:27:15] ice comes open
[1:27:18] this is my first time in seeing you but
[1:27:20] you that was seen
[1:27:22] right you're the eyes to see
[1:27:28] praise the Lord so you see the same
[1:27:30] thing also that's part of the things
[1:27:34] that we go through and the struggle that
[1:27:36] we go through for the fact that God has
[1:27:39] already grabbed our attention
[1:27:42] amen grab our attention for us to be
[1:27:45] able to see his purpose for our life
[1:27:48] that that discouraging things that we go
[1:27:51] through do not
[1:27:52] change our mind about what God is doing
[1:27:55] in our lives
[1:27:57] the trials that we go through do not
[1:27:59] change our mind we know that he love us
[1:28:02] we know that he care for us we know that
[1:28:05] he's going to provide for us
[1:28:08] why because we have grabbed the key
[1:28:12] all of these things are happening
[1:28:14] because there is a purpose
[1:28:17] there is a design the designer has
[1:28:20] already designed it
[1:28:23] and he says that is to bring you to
[1:28:25] unexpected ends
[1:28:29] and that's the reason why we don't
[1:28:31] accept God because we are afraid of hell
[1:28:33] is just a life of appreciation
[1:28:37] we are thanking him every day in the
[1:28:40] good times in the by time we are still
[1:28:42] thanking him
[1:28:46] praise the Lord
[1:28:49] we not only appreciating the desire we
[1:28:51] know the designer
[1:28:58] that the works of God will be made
[1:29:01] manifest in our life
[1:29:05] okay
[1:29:08] that God will be glorified in our lives
[1:29:11] that God will bring us to the place of
[1:29:14] where we are his sons and his daughter
[1:29:17] God's purpose
[1:29:20] praise the Lord
[1:29:23] amen
[1:29:27] for us to be able to look at the heavens
[1:29:30] and appreciate the Stars sometimes you
[1:29:32] just look at the cloud
[1:29:34] and you just appreciate it
[1:29:38] praise the Lord
[1:29:39] I used to have a neighbor there in Eagan
[1:29:42] he lived close to us he was a mountain
[1:29:44] Back Robin
[1:29:46] you know he'll go to Colorado his son
[1:29:49] and he comes back
[1:29:53] sometime when we are talking
[1:29:56] and uh
[1:29:58] I really never saw him going to church
[1:30:01] but every time he goes on his his back
[1:30:04] ride and he comes back
[1:30:06] he will always says that I love to go to
[1:30:09] Colorado
[1:30:11] and he says when I go on to on those
[1:30:14] mountains I enjoy worshiping God
[1:30:19] well I've never seen him going to church
[1:30:24] praise the Lord
[1:30:27] and uh
[1:30:29] you see there can never be a design
[1:30:31] without an intelligence behind it
[1:30:37] without intelligence all you can have is
[1:30:41] chaos
[1:30:45] praise the Lord
[1:30:46] all you can have is chaos to have this
[1:30:50] road that she has separated to have this
[1:30:53] road and have this role here and put
[1:30:56] this piano here there was a thought
[1:30:59] behind it
[1:31:05] praise the Lord
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:11] there was a talk behind it right
[1:31:20] our complexion might be different but
[1:31:23] look at our design
[1:31:27] in most cases we have two eyes
[1:31:31] two ears
[1:31:33] two hands
[1:31:37] that's not something that just came by
[1:31:40] itself
[1:31:42] that's not something that just came from
[1:31:44] an explosion
[1:31:47] foreign
[1:31:50] intelligence behind it
[1:31:57] praise the Lord there is an intelligence
[1:32:00] behind it
[1:32:02] and then when you look in the mirror you
[1:32:04] appreciate it
[1:32:11] glory be to God
[1:32:16] there is an intelligence
[1:32:18] that is behind
[1:32:22] the things that we go through
[1:32:28] praise the Lord
[1:32:30] there is an intelligence that is behind
[1:32:32] the things that we go through
[1:32:37] we might Now understand it
[1:32:41] sometimes it seems that that would be
[1:32:43] the thing that would cost our life
[1:32:46] but somehow we came out of faith
[1:32:51] sometimes sometimes we talk that you
[1:32:54] know we we're never going to make it but
[1:32:55] we came out of it
[1:33:01] and that's what I want for us to
[1:33:03] appreciate tonight
[1:33:05] while we say to you
[1:33:07] amen
[1:33:09] that even our
[1:33:12] Gathering here as a body
[1:33:16] it's not just to be able to you know
[1:33:20] have our you know religious cycle going
[1:33:24] there is a design there is an
[1:33:27] intelligence
[1:33:30] behind the design
[1:33:33] that keeps us here as a church
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] there is a purpose
[1:33:48] he said he wants us to be like a city on
[1:33:50] the hill
[1:33:52] amen
[1:33:53] I said it on the hill always cast
[1:33:55] influence
[1:33:57] he want us to be like salt
[1:34:00] for our life to make others to be testy
[1:34:07] but that's what I want for us to catch
[1:34:10] because
[1:34:11] it will help us in a great deal as a
[1:34:13] church
[1:34:15] to know that
[1:34:18] there's a designer that have placed us
[1:34:20] here that have been able to pull us
[1:34:23] from our different background
[1:34:26] our different years different age
[1:34:28] different uh
[1:34:31] ethnicity and whatever is that and he
[1:34:33] brought us here
[1:34:37] praise the Lord
[1:34:40] that the work of God
[1:34:42] might be manifest
[1:34:44] this is not about the work of a man
[1:34:49] amen
[1:34:51] because if he was about a work of a man
[1:34:53] long time he fell
[1:34:57] if we realize and believe there is there
[1:34:59] is an intelligence
[1:35:01] they are there they have drawn us here
[1:35:04] and that is dealing with us every time
[1:35:06] we come to church and and we go home
[1:35:09] what about our life our our different
[1:35:12] lives work and school and whatever it is
[1:35:15] and then we come back again to church if
[1:35:18] we just realize
[1:35:20] that
[1:35:21] there is a great intelligence great
[1:35:23] designer
[1:35:27] and his purpose
[1:35:30] is to manifest his work
[1:35:35] in our lives
[1:35:38] he's using us
[1:35:40] to
[1:35:41] to work on one another
[1:35:45] like Solomon was chasing like I am
[1:35:47] shopping iron
[1:35:49] like Paul will say is provoking one
[1:35:51] another
[1:35:53] to Godly works
[1:35:59] that God's Great intelligence
[1:36:02] it's not just all about it you know we
[1:36:04] come and open the scripture then can we
[1:36:05] talk about the Mysteries and talk about
[1:36:07] things to make you excited you know talk
[1:36:10] about things in uh uh to make you
[1:36:12] hopeful no
[1:36:16] so you can make it back to the next
[1:36:18] service
[1:36:21] I want to make you to realize that
[1:36:26] there is a designer that has already cut
[1:36:29] out your Life Path
[1:36:33] praise the Lord
[1:36:35] amen
[1:36:37] even now I will visitors that came in
[1:36:40] tonight
[1:36:41] right from the foundation of the word it
[1:36:44] was in their life part that it would be
[1:36:46] here tonight
[1:36:48] nothing they could have done to escape
[1:36:50] it
[1:36:51] if they could have done anything they
[1:36:53] would not be sitting here
[1:36:57] since that's that's that's that's the
[1:36:59] great intelligence of God
[1:37:03] that's the great intelligence of God
[1:37:07] the way he deals with our lives
[1:37:11] the things he allow us to go through
[1:37:17] you see that's the thing that makes us
[1:37:19] when we wake up in the morning we can
[1:37:21] help but live for our eyes open to the
[1:37:24] Hills
[1:37:25] we're coming our help
