[Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] he had to put him on equal basis of free moral agency to make his own charts but knowing he would fall now he can't be a savior unless something's lost he can't be healer unless something sick these things have to be that way God made them thus so that his great attributes could be displayed if there was nothing he had never been a savior but we know he was even before there was a time he was a savior he was a savior so there has to be something lost how is it going to be if he takes and loses it just an order to save it then it isn't Justice to his judgment he couldn't send the man to hell and be just he's kind gentle true honest and he's a great judge see he'd be working against himself so he had to put a man out here and make him all free moral agency so he would knowing would fall and the man in his own image how could he fall now you seeing daylight so he had to make a byproduct something out of the original creation ah you see it see there you come back then that's what fell he made it knowing it would fall and he's put over the hands of Satan for a vessel Of Dishonor words honored bestowed today you think on that notice closely now then again why she was designed this way and not like other females why was the woman designed so and not other females now the other females are designed like that they're not today they can not be made that way she can't do it why did he not make this female man of woman just like other females so she'd just be the same way to just raise her babies that should have her husband live and when it come time for a baby should have her baby why do you make her like this I can't say these words and you understand what I'm talking about don't you if you can understand say amen amen you know see uh it's a young girl sitting here and young boys but you know the animal has to come to a certain time of the year than her mate then that's all but a woman is anytime why did he make her like this I watch this great program unfolders are going through here now just as perfect as perfect can be I didn't know this the other day why didn't he make her like that in the beginning like the rest of his females because it would be Unbecoming to him he's the Fountain of all purity that's the reason he had let Satan get a hold of her what he done in the perversion such a creature would be would not be becoming to him originally designed for all his works that he designed in the original is in continuity all of his original worksters in continuity the female dog the male dog see female cow the male cow everything in continuity all nature is in continuity she died going the ground is like death burial Resurrection the sap goes down of a tree drops his sleeve comes back next year the resurrection of a new Leaf do you want to mean everything even nature of God is all in a continuity in one and here's one design out of the continuity of God Nature's so designed so it can't sin think the original creation of God could not see oh don't you see now in this view here the perversion of the church the original is God's word there's no sin in God see what I mean here's a creature that come into existence by perversion God's going to have a church but look at this preparing thing they got out here God has male and female but this woman see the very symptoms of it shows back what was in God's mind you could take an hour or two and break that down she made this creature for that way he made the creature eternity so Satan could get a hold of her and he did he still got her she better flee to the cross like man too notice all nature runs in continuity if he had made the woman in the same Regional creation that had been no sin because she couldn't have done it you couldn't have done it she is a perversion of the original creation so is all sin a perversion of the original truth what is a lie is the truth perverted what is an adultery is the right act perverted so there is the perverted creature there is a perverted whole thing and the whole thing is spelled s-i-n laying right there that's why the questions are great only a peace scrap made of a man to deceive him God made it right here's proved it that's what she's made for our immoral woman is the lowest thing that can be thought of in the Earth excuse this young ladies she's nothing but a human garbage can a sex exposure that's all she is I am or a woman is a human sexual garbage can of pollution we're filthy dirty ornery slow down filth is disposed by her why she made this way far deception every sin that every was on the Earth was caused by a woman and a angel is just from Chicago a woman wrote this article the police force that they chased down in United States Metropolitan United States that 98 of every crime that was ever did in any form in the United States there was either a woman in it or behind it now I'm saying all this to get to one thing here at the end so what you can see what's the matter she was made to deceive like she did Adam at the beginning tell him that the fruit was pleasant and so forth to deceive him and take him away from the word that's the way the church does today same thing but then after that he become her ruler to rule over now what a difference in this day in this day of conception instead of him being her ruler she has become his God sure she rules him now you can probably well understand what I've been hitting at by her beauty and her sex control her shape what was given to her by Satan the byproduct as Satan did she is sent to deceive sons of God and she could sway more up to hell in any other instrument Satan's got it exactly right I'm talking to the immoral now not you sisters we'll give you a place right placed in a few minutes in the word of God here it was in God's plan from the beginning now to do this today what is the god of the United States you remember the Tabernacle years ago I preached on that the God of this modern day a little flapper sitting there with makeup on and dressed pulled up over her knees and things like I said behold your God and that's right she's on every advertisement half naked she's on the street the same way it's an instrument of Satan from the beginning Jesus said we see with the soul now and from the beginning and what he's talking about now the heathens used to make her a god did you know that a goddess sure it is the maker of goddess for they did have sex acts in their worship they claimed that she was a Creator in her womb she carried the seed and created that's a lie there's only one Creator that's God but remember Paul there dying of Ephesus uh image of a rock said the goddess of Heaven throw downers to see our Heathen worship is and we not knowing it turns right straight back to Heathen worship again to women the very on the Earth woman worship she a swayed man any way she wants to and not knowing all that beauty on the outside of hell is on the inside Solomon said her or Gates is a gates to hell now we see plainly here what Jesus spoke up and the revelations the second chapter and the 15th verse of the Nickelodeon Doctrine the oncoming of that church pulling itself away from the word also we can see here planing these vulgar ungodly filthy programs that we have on television of Hollywood sex Queens we can see the filth of this city as these kids little old girls walking up and down the street here with a little big tight toes twisting around and hit cold enough to freeze them to death they don't know that that's the devil doing that they are possessed of an evil spirit and don't know you don't see a female dog doing that do you you don't see any other female doing that and no mayo better walk up to her either see now you get the picture we introduced something just in a moment the Lord willing now you see the Nickelodeon's you see their Doctrine you see the teenage Queens they call them these striptease is out on the street used to have to go to some vulgar show on the side to see a striptease just open your eyes look out on the street that's all you have to do now the whole thing's a striptease sure what are they doing for to tantalize tempt that's the only thing she can do it for amen amen she doesn't because she's filthy she does it because she's made that way she don't realize that she's the instrument in the hands of Satan that's what she is Even in our school today they're teaching sex acts our rotten world of woman worship I know they don't want to believe that Stan is saying some kind of him and so forth on one day and out with women running around all night long all right when a God's side the word she is the lowest of all animals that God put on the Earth watch that's why God forbids her to teach his word that's right first Timothy 2 9-15 I suffered not a woman to teach her to heaven and also First Corinthians 14 34 let your women keep silent in the churches first not permitted to them to speak for they are command to be inside all so saith the law but today what does a church do they make her pastors evangelists when the Bible completely forbids it and the Bible said has also said the law making it run in continuity the whole thing is like the lamb was last night the only place of worship or the shed blood of the Lamb it's the only place today in Christ the only way to just come into him that's the only place to worship it always was that way the only place to worship is trying to shed blood so now we see the whole picture of it unfolding to us there she is that's why God won't let her teach won't let her do anything in the church but to set still with a veiled face now can you see why I have said to things and done the things that I've done knowing all this in my heart brother sisters I know sisters I'm you got your place just a moment and a wonderful character that God can mold in you but I'm just trying to speak on the other side to show what you're actually from the beginning Jesus told us go back to beginning to find it that's what we're doing now I've had to hit the high points on a lot of this and I hope you understand it and you people who will be listening to this tape I hope you understand just go back it's only to show that Jesus said go back from the beginning and find out all things go back to the beginning you can see today why people they say I'm a woman hater that's far from the truth uh do not they call a woman remember they call Paul a woman hater a woman a minister not long ago said oh you're like old Paul all he had to do is pick on us women a saint of God that was permitted to write the Bible the New Testament and dispute his words he said of an angel from heaven teaches any other thing and this and I've said let he be a curse let alone some woman preacher he said Elijah was a woman hater he wasn't a woman hated real women he just didn't like them Jezebels [Music] and if that be so then must be God must be the same way because he is the word which come to the prophets so it must be God the same way so see he knows original creation from the beginning he said from the beginning they were prophets who the word came to and he made her or man and not man for her did you know that that woman was made for man and not man for woman how many knows that the Bible teaches that all right she was given a place in man before the fall equal over all creation but after the fall now here we bring the subject up but after the fall he was her ruler she must keep silent and all matters now after the original beginning is over Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning that's when time began when God made it first in his original creation all to understand say Amen again in the beginning God created just one male and one female but then the woman was made different from the animals all other animals for deception now watch now it wasn't so from the beginning she was made if she stayed in her original condition she would have never been no fall but she caused the fall in the interruption that broke the whole continuity of God and Joe deaths all right everything else on the Earth she made thus now notice now after the beginning after the beginning after a Time began back in that was eternity is over notice after that fall was made by Eve after the fall there was need to be another covenant made now this is going to stumble you but I'm going to give you the scripture to prove it that this is the truth now notice after the fall Jesus said God at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall now we're going beyond that the Covenant was co-equal but now add to the fall there's another covenant made now she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant now let's see if that's right let's take Genesis 3. and find out if this is right as we go along because we want to be positive these things they're taught out brought out exactly true so that maybe right here we have a little time because we're not too far from the end now to get to the closing part of the subject to show why and what about divorces and so forth now in Genesis the third chapter and we will begin uh now with the third and the 16th verse let's begin to 14 first and the Lord set unto the serpent I just go to curse it because thou has thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all the cattle of every beast of the field and upon thy belly Thou shalt go and thus shall thou eat all the days of our life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and the woman's seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruised he is healed the promising coming to the woman the Messiah to redeemed unto the woman he said hello now there's the Covenant with the serpent which they were all all right beforehand at the beginning or before the beginning unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrows and our conception and in sorrow shall thou bring four children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee not no more co-equal together at all now she's turned right around she's a ruler and into Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and as eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat it cursed be the ground now curse it Adam now curse it be the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and officials shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herbs of the veal and his sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou returns to the ground for out of it out of it was thou taken for dust Thy Art and unto dust shalt thou return two Covenants now that closes the beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't so at the beginning we got another Covenant now notice it's another Covenant now there's a covenant for the product and a the byproduct notice the fall brought trouble death to every creature of the creation making a difference in all nature now let us notice what Jesus said about from the beginning it wasn't so now it is not soul from it is now it is after the beginning now there's a double Covenant first was just a covenant Adam and Eve is co equal one man one woman now the woman sinned what does she do that told him all to death and God had to make a covenant by that another Covenant here it is right here in Genesis 3 16. he made another Covenant now the world is to be repopulated not by the original creation of God like in the beginning not by the original creation but by sex desire ah that takes care of the beginning though in the beginning there's only one man and one woman one male one female but when she crossed that line and brought this sin now the world's to be repopulated again by sex not the creation by sex see where the woman's at now now but that's the way the world's populated Aid through women that's reason Jesus had to come through the woman to bring it back to its original beginning again without sex desire he's virgin born but Hallelujah there will come a time where it will be no more sex but God shall call his children from the dust of the Earth back like it was in the original not to any woman but through the molding of the clay and the cosmic lights and the petroleum he'll create again like he did Adam at the first time Jesus made this possible by God making himself a man and coming to the world so he could die through this woman now it's testing Time by sin now you see then after the beginning it was something else was introduced now this is going to shock you are you tired this sits still just a little longer then when the devil Covenant was made by man and woman through sex another Covenant altogether not the original Covenant but another Covenant now let's introduce polygamy and all then after the beginning polygamy was introduced both in man and in Beast after the beginning the fall God now second dearly sets a new nature Again by sex God created the first without sex you believe that now it's another Covenant with nature he sets it in another order by sex second Covenant one male many females one Buck dear a whole Harem of does that right yeah one bull a whole herd of cattle cows one rooster a yard full of hens is that right one David attribee's on heart with 500 wives with a hundred children born to him in one year of different women a man after God's Own Heart one Solomon with a thousand wives but notice now it wasn't so at the beginning but now it's actually the beginning the woman's done this then she just becomes what she is now see David [Music] foreign [Music]
