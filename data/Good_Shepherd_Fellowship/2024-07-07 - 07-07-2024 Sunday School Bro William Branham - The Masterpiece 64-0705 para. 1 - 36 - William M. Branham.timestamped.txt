[0:00] [Music]
[1:55] while our heads and hearts are bowed
[1:57] before God I I wonder how how many in
[2:00] here has a request that they'd like God
[2:02] to remember for just lifting up your
[2:05] hand now hold your request in your heart
[2:08] and eyes we pray Lord Jesus thou the the
[2:12] fountain inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[2:16] flow through us today Lord and cleanse
[2:19] us from all
[2:21] unbelief all sin that we might stand in
[2:26] thy presence now Hallelujah knowing that
[2:29] there is need Among Us that we know that
[2:32] we are sinners and not not worthy of any
[2:35] blessing but then when we think of him
[2:38] who came and took our sins and when his
[2:42] blood's there it's not it's not us in
[2:45] the presence of God it's him just our
[2:48] Voice through his blood his blood
[2:50] speaking oh God then cleanse our hearts
[2:54] from sin and
[2:55] unbelief give to us the desires of our
[2:58] heart for we we truly have these desires
[3:02] to serve you and in these weakening
[3:05] conditions and afflictions and things of
[3:07] the world that's put up on us sometime
[3:09] to perfect us we've been told that that
[3:13] he said think it not strange that these
[3:15] trials come they're only working out for
[3:18] our good and to perfect us and bring us
[3:21] into that place these great deserts of
[3:24] experience or a righteous man are molded
[3:26] into Saints yes we we thank thee for
[3:29] these experiences Lord we would no mean
[3:32] no wise want to uh do anything contrary
[3:36] to your will but we pray father that in
[3:39] this we be brought closer to you and
[3:41] when the burdens are so heavy we can't
[3:43] go no far then we raise our hands and
[3:45] scream to our father then hear from
[3:48] Heaven Lord Heal us make us well for the
[3:52] kingdom of God's sake bless Thy word
[3:54] this morning Lord Thy word is the truth
[3:57] and we've assembled here now the church
[4:00] we pray for brother Neville for brother
[4:02] caps and brother Collins and all the
[4:04] rest of the ministers and the and the
[4:07] trustees deacons and all the Le and the
[4:09] strangers in our gates oh God may this
[4:11] be a day that we'll long remember
[4:14] because of your presence we're here
[4:17] under great expectation this morning
[4:19] Lord just momentarily notice call
[4:21] together we feel that it's for a purpose
[4:25] may your purpose be achieved Lord for we
[4:27] ask it in Jesus name as as we submit
[4:30] ourselves amen glory to
[4:39] God it's Grand to be here and to uh be
[4:44] assembled with this church full of
[4:46] people I wasn't expecting to be hardly
[4:49] anyone here this morning because I
[4:51] didn't hardly know myself I was going to
[4:52] be
[4:53] here we just got in from
[4:56] Philadelphia and so
[5:00] I come in thinking I was going to have
[5:02] to go to Arizona right quick for have a
[5:06] funeral service for a friend of mine uh
[5:10] uh Captain Jim Mosley a very precious
[5:13] Godly boy led to Christ not long ago
[5:15] with three mosle brothers and um one of
[5:19] them fell was in the plane the other day
[5:22] and was killed instantly and laid in the
[5:24] fire for 10 hours before they got to him
[5:27] so Lee is 28 years old wife 26 and and
[5:32] leave three little children the oldest
[5:34] seven very sad and uh they when they got
[5:38] him in then they had to bury him the
[5:39] next day so I just I didn't get to go
[5:41] and I just wrote out or sent a telegram
[5:44] what I was going to say what I would
[5:46] have said at brother Moses's funeral and
[5:48] some these things we can't understand
[5:51] but yet uh he makes everything work just
[5:54] right we are here in service of the Lord
[5:58] this morning knowing that
[6:00] that that we believe God that we believe
[6:03] that he'll make everything just exactly
[6:05] right regardless of what it is and how
[6:07] it works out we know it's got to work
[6:09] for good he promised that it's just got
[6:11] to be that
[6:13] way sometimes we can't understand that
[6:16] gets very complicated at times but yet
[6:19] we know it is the truth because the
[6:22] Bible says it's a truth and the Bible to
[6:25] us is God and letter form amen now we've
[6:28] got to place our face
[6:30] somewhere and if if I any of us in life
[6:35] tried to make a success in life and
[6:38] become many times a
[6:41] multi-millionaire but what are we going
[6:43] to do with that we got to come down at
[6:46] the end of the road and what what good
[6:48] is it to us s and uh money is a a script
[6:52] it's an
[6:53] exchange but you can't exchange it for
[6:56] life only God has life so we we realize
[7:00] that we're here in a negative
[7:03] form and as long as there is a negative
[7:05] there has to be a positive there cannot
[7:09] be a negative without a positive see
[7:12] because it's because of the positive
[7:15] that makes the negative like you had a
[7:18] negative picture of some object there
[7:20] has to be an object somewhere or it to
[7:23] strike the Light Strike that lens or
[7:25] there wouldn't be any any negative so
[7:28] when we see that our life here is in the
[7:31] negative and knowing that we're in the
[7:33] image of some life
[7:35] somewhere then we know that there is a
[7:38] positive somewhere that the light has
[7:41] struck and it's reflected something here
[7:43] on Earth and we are only that
[7:47] reflection the genuine object is
[7:52] somewhere if that isn't I'm the worst
[7:55] deceived man in the world I've spent my
[7:57] life in vain but but I know beyond a
[8:01] shadow of doubt that it's there that's
[8:04] why we're
[8:05] here when I see you people come across
[8:08] the country on a few moments no and
[8:11] sometime presuming then it makes me feel
[8:13] real little when I come into a meeting
[8:15] like this to think that I know people
[8:16] here traveled for hundreds of miles just
[8:19] to be here for a few minutes of service
[8:22] just to sit here some woman just made a
[8:25] remark coming in the other day and said
[8:28] show me where the the man is walk and
[8:30] let me walk behind
[8:32] him upon the
[8:34] ground so I'll get
[8:36] well now if people believes you like
[8:38] that and you're representative of Christ
[8:41] then what should we do we should be very
[8:43] careful because you're not only
[8:45] destroying yourself as wrong you're
[8:46] destroying others who are following
[8:48] you so I know no denomination or nothing
[8:51] to take you to only one thing I have my
[8:54] faith in if you believe me follow what I
[8:56] tell you because I believe the Bible
[8:59] that's the word of God other things
[9:03] fail amen um he is life he is the word
[9:10] now I know that you when I come here I
[9:14] keep you long I pray to God when I felt
[9:17] like I want to come here today I've had
[9:19] so many interviews and calls and so
[9:21] forth I had to meet some of them this
[9:23] morning and I said well brother Neville
[9:25] no doubt asked me to speak and that was
[9:28] Friday and I said brother Neville will
[9:30] probably ask me to speak and what I do
[9:32] then I pray God so hot been so hot and
[9:36] he was good to send us the rain and
[9:38] break the real extreme heat give us a
[9:40] good morning this morning I pray that
[9:42] his goodness will shower each one of you
[9:44] all that you'll ever remember being here
[9:47] this morning may his grace and blessings
[9:50] be upon you bless not to visit a friend
[9:53] is sick brother Bill da I don't see him
[9:56] here this morning somehow oh here he is
[9:58] he's
[9:59] and I was thinking an old man of 91
[10:02] years old and still storing across the
[10:05] the country through the deserts and over
[10:07] the snowy mountains and slick
[10:09] roads you don't have to do that God has
[10:13] been good to him he don't have to do
[10:15] that he could sit home and have Servants
[10:17] of fan him if he wanted to but something
[10:20] happened to build out he was borned
[10:23] again and when it was something come
[10:26] into his heart that all he lives for
[10:29] is to attend these services and then if
[10:32] I'm to be the mouthpiece of God would I
[10:36] deceive a friend I'd rather die and let
[10:40] me tell him exactly what's the truth out
[10:42] of this Bible then that's God's word I'm
[10:44] Miss repeating what he said now I want
[10:48] to read some out of the
[10:49] Bible before we U read I'd like to to
[10:55] say that I believe tonight is a
[10:56] communion night and and uh you who uh
[11:01] are here locally of course the other
[11:03] people will probably be going back to
[11:04] their homes because they have to go to
[11:05] work you who are locally here in the
[11:07] assembly remember the Brethren will be
[11:10] giv communion tonight
[11:13] now I'm waiting for uh the final call
[11:16] for
[11:17] Africa uh they would won't let me in as
[11:21] a
[11:21] missionary so the only way I can go in
[11:25] uh down I'm going to Kenya Uganda and
[11:28] Tanzania
[11:30] and the only way I can go in first the
[11:32] churches won't let you in CU they want
[11:34] me to preach something on this side and
[11:36] that side down in Africa I won't go in
[11:39] like that I wouldn't be hypocrite enough
[11:41] to do that so I either tell them no sir
[11:43] I'll just preach just what God puts on
[11:45] my heart and that's all see and I'm sure
[11:47] it won't be what they're trying to get
[11:49] me to teach so uh Triune baptisms and so
[11:53] forth like that and fussing with them no
[11:55] but I've been asked to a big convention
[11:58] by brother Bose he's just on the verge
[12:02] of coming to seeing some daylight of
[12:05] what we believe and so uh I've asked to
[12:09] come in like I was going on a hunting
[12:10] trip if they let me in like going in
[12:13] hunting if I get somebody to say they
[12:15] take me hunting then when I get in there
[12:18] the doctor the
[12:19] doctor's there at the ambassy is a
[12:22] personal friend of mine out of Chicago
[12:24] and as soon as I get in there he say
[12:26] well here's brother Ren over here let's
[12:28] have a meeting so after there the
[12:30] ambassy can't turn me down if me so
[12:32] they're trying to work it through now so
[12:35] I trust that if it's God's will it'll
[12:38] work out that way see it's just
[12:40] committed to him if not then I'll notify
[12:42] you I want if it be the will of God then
[12:44] I want to speak on the seven trumpets
[12:47] and that'll be about 8 day service and
[12:49] we won't be here at the Tabernacle
[12:51] perhaps we try to get an auditorium here
[12:54] I never thought of this new Auditorium
[12:56] just being built up here it's exactly
[12:58] where I saw Jesus the first time in
[13:00] Vision aitor built right over the same
[13:03] spot I went right there the day to L
[13:05] when I looked and see him looking
[13:06] towards the east you remember hearing me
[13:08] tell it when I was out there praying for
[13:09] my father um the little boy just a boy
[13:12] preacher that's where I saw him steep
[13:14] looking at him he just had his head
[13:16] turned sideways from me I kept walking
[13:18] around clearing my throat in a broom
[13:19] Sage field I kept watching and he never
[13:22] turned I called his name Jesus and he
[13:24] turned around held his arms out and
[13:25] that's all I remembered until daylight
[13:28] and so I come back out of the field on
[13:30] towards
[13:31] daylight so maybe the Lord let me preach
[13:34] those trumpets there wherever it is
[13:37] God's will be done turn in your Bibles
[13:40] now uh to Isaiah the 50 um 53rd chapter
[13:46] of
[13:54] Isaiah now we trust that God will bless
[13:58] our feeble effort are coming together
[14:00] this morning we just come down from
[14:03] Philadelphia where is at the Full Gospel
[14:06] business man's
[14:08] convention and um listening to their
[14:11] different testimonies and so forth up
[14:14] there then I on the road down I was
[14:18] Billy Paul and I and Rebecca and little
[14:22] Collins girl little Betty
[14:24] Collins and Billy is a very good sleeper
[14:27] and Beck is better and so uh Betty and I
[14:33] talked and she was sitting back with
[14:35] Becky in the back seat and uh I seen
[14:39] something on the road happen and when I
[14:42] did something struck me and Betty if
[14:46] she's here she noticed I quit talking
[14:49] started writing something down that's
[14:51] where I got this text for this morning
[14:53] now let us stand to our feet if we
[15:01] how we stand in honor of God's
[15:04] word as I read Isaiah the 53rd chapter
[15:08] who has believed our report and to whom
[15:11] is the arm of the Lord
[15:15] revealed notice it's a question to begin
[15:18] with for he shall grow up before him as
[15:23] a tender plant and as a root out of dry
[15:26] ground he has no Farm nor commonness
[15:29] and when we shall see him there is no
[15:32] beauty that we should desire him he is
[15:37] despised and rejected of man a man of
[15:41] sorrow acquainted with grief and we hid
[15:45] as it were our faces from him he was
[15:49] despised and we esteemed him not surely
[15:53] he has borne our grief and has carried
[15:56] our sorrows yet we did esteem him
[16:00] stricken smitten of God and Afflicted
[16:04] but he was wounded for our
[16:08] transgressions he was bruised for our
[16:11] iniquities the Chast of our peace was
[16:14] upon on him and with his stripes we were
[16:17] healed all we like sheep have gone
[16:20] astray we've turned everyone to his own
[16:23] way and the lord has laid upon him the
[16:28] iniquity of us all he was
[16:32] oppressed and was afflicted yet he
[16:35] opened not his mouth he was brought as a
[16:39] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[16:43] before her shears dumb so he opened not
[16:46] his mouth he was taken from prison and
[16:49] from judgment and who shall declare his
[16:53] generation for he was cut off out of the
[16:56] land of the living for the trans
[16:58] transgressions of my people he was
[17:01] stricken and he made his grave with the
[17:05] wicked and with the rich in his death
[17:08] because he has done no violence neither
[17:11] was there deceit in his mouth yet it
[17:13] pleased the Lord to bruise
[17:16] him he put him to grief when thou
[17:21] shallal make his soul an offering for
[17:23] sin he shall seiz his seed and he shall
[17:26] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[17:29] Lord shall prosper in his hand and he
[17:32] shall see of the travail of his soul and
[17:37] shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[17:40] shall many righteous servants be
[17:42] justified many for he shall bear their
[17:47] iniquity therefore I will divide him a
[17:51] portion with the great and shall divide
[17:54] the spars with the strong because he has
[17:57] poured out his Soul unto death and was
[18:01] numbered with the transgressors and he
[18:04] bear the sins of many and made
[18:07] intercessions for the
[18:10] transgressors father
[18:13] God Thy word is a
[18:16] lamp uh the light that lights the path
[18:19] of every
[18:21] believer into the presence of God as it
[18:24] carries us like a lantern in our hand
[18:27] you have not provided enough that we
[18:29] should see the end from the beginning
[18:32] and but walk with faith but as a man
[18:35] would travel through a dark forest at
[18:37] night and that's where we are the light
[18:40] that he holds only provides step by step
[18:45] but the path though leading
[18:47] upward just walk with the light and may
[18:52] the light shine today upon the word to
[18:54] lead us one step further to the kingdom
[18:58] of God God for we ask it in Jesus name
[19:03] amen please
[19:10] seated the subject that I feel to speak
[19:14] to the congregation today is the
[19:21] Masterpiece it may seem rather strange
[19:24] to take a a scripture reading like this
[19:27] of a of one of the most
[19:31] bruised and
[19:33] murderous of pictures of the
[19:36] Bible that when the Bible says that this
[19:41] perfect
[19:42] servant that was afflicted and bruised
[19:46] and
[19:48] torn and yet take a text from that as
[19:51] Masterpiece very
[19:53] strange but I'm my mind is thinking this
[19:57] morning as
[19:59] uh we journey back I do for a few years
[20:02] I was invited up to far
[20:05] lawn and and California above Los
[20:10] Angeles my first purpose for going up
[20:13] there was to visit the the grave of of
[20:17] Amy simple mcferson the founder of the
[20:20] four square
[20:23] movement and I went to her her
[20:26] tomb and uh although I differ with the
[20:29] woman as a minister but yet in my heart
[20:33] I give admiration and respect for for
[20:37] what she stood for and the the hour and
[20:40] the persecution things she had to go
[20:42] through with and um and time of her
[20:46] being here on the earth and then for her
[20:48] her beloved Son which is a bosom friend
[20:51] of mine Roth
[20:53] mcferson and a group of ministers we
[20:55] went up there and they we didn't have
[20:58] time time to go in uh to the uh into the
[21:03] the place where they had the cremation
[21:05] and put the the bodies in a a little box
[21:09] on the side of the wall and in there
[21:11] they had some outstanding uh things such
[21:14] as the last supper and it's lighted by
[21:18] the actual light of the Sun and they
[21:21] have a shutter that it gives them when
[21:23] they go in it's light and then as as
[21:26] they begin to speak it darkens up and
[21:28] after while it all becomes dark and then
[21:32] the people go out and they have all the
[21:35] supper and the woman that helped the
[21:38] secret of how to beat this glass into
[21:41] this place while I make these pictures
[21:44] why it had come through a family for
[21:46] many years back and the art was just
[21:49] give it to the children and the last one
[21:51] was a woman and there was uh fixing this
[21:54] picture and uh when they went to mold
[21:58] and burn
[21:59] the the glass bake it of Judas iscar it
[22:03] busted so then they tried it again and
[22:05] it busted again and she said maybe our
[22:09] Lord doesn't want his enemy picture by
[22:11] his side and said if it burst again will
[22:15] not complete the picture but it helped
[22:17] that time then of course that was a
[22:20] striking thing and how that such things
[22:23] would happen but then one of the main
[22:26] things that interests me and Baron was
[22:31] Michelangelo's uh the great sculpture
[22:34] the the Monument of
[22:38] Moses it's a A reproduction there of
[22:41] course it isn't the original but it was
[22:44] such a a Great
[22:46] Masterpiece and as I stood and looked at
[22:48] I I like that something that looks like
[22:51] it's represents got something to it I
[22:54] like art real well I believe God is in
[22:57] art I believe God is in music I believe
[23:01] God is in
[23:03] nature God's everywhere and anything
[23:05] that's
[23:06] contrary to the original is a
[23:11] perversion God is in dancing not the
[23:14] kind of dancing you do here but when the
[23:16] Sons and Daughters of God are in the
[23:18] spirit of God that's dancing but uh like
[23:23] I had to contend with the 2:00 this
[23:24] morning up there in the lane uh that's
[23:27] the perversion of it but this
[23:31] masterpiece that
[23:33] Michelangelo had had made it uh it cost
[23:37] him something to do that that he was a
[23:39] great man and it cost a big part of his
[23:43] life because he was many many years and
[23:47] carving out just take a rock and Marvel
[23:51] and keep carving it and to see only the
[23:53] man the sculpture himself has in his
[23:56] mind what he's trying to do
[23:59] he he's the one you might walk up and
[24:02] say to him what are you pecking on that
[24:04] rock for to The Outsider who doesn't
[24:07] know what's in his heart uh it's
[24:10] nonsense but the the man the sculpture
[24:13] himself he he's got a A Vision in his
[24:17] mind what he's trying to make and he's
[24:20] trying to reproduce what he has on his
[24:23] mind in the form of a of a monument
[24:28] that's the reason he's digging it out of
[24:30] the rocks and this to do you have to
[24:32] start off right at the
[24:34] beginning and you have to follow the
[24:37] pattern see you can't get a little piece
[24:41] start off we'll make it this way no I
[24:43] believe no he's got to have a exact
[24:47] pattern and in his mind he's got that
[24:49] pattern and he cannot vary from that
[24:52] pattern now in order to do this he had
[24:55] to draw in his mind because we have no
[24:58] real pictures of
[25:00] Moses but he had to get a mental picture
[25:03] in his mind of exactly what Moses was
[25:08] now a genuine sculpture is inspired like
[25:11] a genuine poet or any genuine singer
[25:14] musician whatever it might be all real
[25:17] has to come by
[25:19] inspiration Michelangelo must have had
[25:22] the inspiration of what Moses really
[25:25] looked like and he caught it in his mind
[25:29] what Moses must have been so he set
[25:31] forth on this great piece of marble The
[25:35] Cutting to the pattern and bringing down
[25:38] and honing down until you got to the
[25:41] real picture of what uh uh it must have
[25:45] been in his mind and then when he got
[25:49] all so perfect ever corner off and every
[25:53] place rubbed and the eyes just right
[25:56] every hair and beard
[25:58] all just the way it
[26:01] was you stood off and looked at it I I
[26:03] think of of many many hard years of
[26:08] Labor and how he had to hold that same
[26:12] vision all the time in his mind of what
[26:14] he was going to
[26:16] do and this think that Vision on his
[26:19] mind for so many
[26:21] years to make it look just exactly to
[26:24] what it was he caught the vision first
[26:27] and how he had work to that Vision
[26:30] cutting off and making down and when he
[26:32] got it to where he perfected
[26:35] it it really got
[26:38] perfect he stood and looked at it when
[26:40] he finished up that morning with a
[26:42] hammer in his hand and he was so
[26:46] inspired when he looked at it because
[26:50] the vision of his mind was standing
[26:54] before him in
[26:56] reality what he had seen
[26:58] seen and his conception of what Moses
[27:03] was there was figured before him what he
[27:07] had in his heart all these years and
[27:11] toils and hours of sorrow and distress
[27:15] and critics and everything else but yet
[27:17] he stayed right with the vision until it
[27:20] was completed
