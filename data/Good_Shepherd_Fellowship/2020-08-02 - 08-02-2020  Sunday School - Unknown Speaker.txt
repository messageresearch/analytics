[Music] [Music] knows all this though who is that fellow that said one time is not that the carpenter's son over here we know him or did he get this wisdom while we don't seem connected with any of our schools we don't know any books he ever learned from who is it he was the answer of the prophet's prophecy here he comes riding upon the fold of an ass what an attraction god was fulfilling his promised word the hour that had been waiting since 4 000 years and genesis the third chapter and the 15th verse god had made the prediction the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head but his head shall bruise her heel that prophecy down through the bible that had been predicted of this man coming here just recently there was a prophet who stood up among them that was vindicated the prophet zechariah and he said that you daughters of jerusalem and you daughters of zion rejoice shout scream out for your king comes to you meek and lowly and humble riding upon the fold of an ass and you're those people that read that scripture day by day watched him come riding in and cried who is this god fulfilling his word to the people that should have known what it was but they didn't know it when god fulfills his word it always causes an attraction always does causes an attraction for it is the unusual so unusual when he fulfills his word to the modern trend of the day because the moderate trend of they don't believe in it they had their own way now we see and let us go back in the scriptures and take some other unusual events just for a few more minutes when god fulfilled his prophecy when god says anything he's going to do it all heavens and earth will pass away but that word can never pass away so it usually causes a scene an unusual scene notice how ridiculous that the word of god to a a people who's supposed to believe it and yet it's so unusual they cry well what's this where'd you get that stuff who is this what is this when they ought to have been screaming hosanna to the king that cometh in the name of the lord but there's just a little group doing that just a little group of 4 000 years of prophecy for the greatest thing that could ever happen to the nation for all the hope of the dead rested upon it all the future laid in it and the religious people that claim they believe it was screaming out who is it what's this attraction something unusual about the same just don't change not unusual let's see some of the unusual things that have just said what was the attraction just before judgment struck the world and destroyed it by water an old man ran years old building a boat when there was no water to float it in up there for years standing in the door building away on the interior on the inside and pitching it inside and out say the world's going to be swallowed up with water the great scientific age what is that pounding up on the hill up there why is that old man by the name of noah and he's up there the old fanatic the old man stood in the sun too long his sunstroke is out of his mind and he's building what he calls an ark and saying the waters is coming from up there where there is no water and it's going to float all the people around and everybody that don't hear his message and everybody that won't come into that ark is going to be drowned did you ever hear such a thing it was an unusual attraction i imagine when the people wanted a good laugh they went up and stood before the ark door and laughed while you said it was going to rain a hundred years ago grandpa told me he heard you up here saying it's going to rain and you're still beating around on this old piece of wood up here why don't you get next to yourself but it was god get ready to confirm a promise and to fulfill a prophecy that is prophetically made very unusual god fulfilling his promise to noah while others was laughing god was also getting ready to make history to show to others even to this day that he keeps his word no matter how unreal it seems unreasonable he still keeps his word he was making an example out of that old man pounding on that ark for these people here in america tonight and all over the world no matter what science says what they say this that or the other he still keeps his word he was making history what was the attraction one day an unusual thing happened back in the wilderness and it was a bush that was on fire and a runaway prophet was standing down in the wilderness you never heard no voice never heard no sound but he looked and seen an unusual thing up on top of the mountain god was trying to attract his attention same is it today god was getting ready to fulfill his word by his prophet abraham your seed shall sojourn 400 years in a strange land i'll bring him out with a mighty hand and he was preparing a man for the job as he was preparing an ark or a safety place for all who would believe god put this bush on fire and this sheepherder moses said i will just turn aside to see what this strange thing means and when he got moses up to the bush he spoke to him what was the attraction later in the pilot's hall when this sheep herder joe down a stick and it turned into a serpent god fulfilling his promise to moses what was the attraction at the dead sea when pharaoh's horses was all astonished when they seen a wind come down from the heavens and parked the red sea from right to left i had a poor bunch of slaves walking in the duty of god walk across that on dry land what was it god keeping his word the deadness moved away a living people went across and a spiritually dead people tried to impersonate it and drowned god fulfilling prophecy and making history that was the traction at the dead sea what was the attraction this second day after that at mount sinai when all the people was command enough to come at their wives when they asked to wash your clothes and sanctify themselves and gather around the mountain where a man by the name of moses had said he met god and a pillar of fire and god had said to moses i'm going to come down amongst the people i'm going to confirm that what i told you and who i am i'm going to show them that i am that god that was attraction god fulfilling his word what was the attraction one day in history where a nation had forgot god where the people had become formal and indifferent were the priests that all went with the modern trend the prophets prophesied according to the will of the priest in that day as usual they had one man that they thought was a fanatic he talked about women wearing paint and everything and he was a kind of odd sort of a guy and this old fellow had come down and said to the king not even dudes go to call come until i call for it and we find out then he'd hit himself and run away from it and he hid out in the wilderness somewhere the company thought that maybe he had starved to death or perished but he had been fed pretty well water too and here he was come down and said do you see that i have thus saith the lord now if you're not convinced yet let's go up to the top of the mountain and prove who's gone or he had another vision from the lord he said choose your altar and make it and choose ox and slam i'll make an altar of the lord and also i will put ox on mine we'll both make a sacrifice and let the god that's god answered you know by no means done that if the lord hadn't told him he said so later i've done this and all this at your command lord but what's the attraction it's got 400 priests standing on the hill and the king of therapies chariot with all of his armors and guards standing around and this old woolly fuzzy face looking man bald head and hairs hanging out over his face piece of sheepskin raped around him hairs all over his body standing up there with a stick in his hand a crucial oil in the other hand that just said three years and a half before that not even due will fall till i call from it for it taking the place of god with such things as halos and shatters and all they talk about and here that old fanatic standing up there on the hill bringing all these people up there what was that attraction it was god fixing to vindicate his prophet to be right was god fulfilling prophecy god also making history fulfilling the word a few hundred years after that there was a man anointed with that same spirit and he come out of the wilderness not connected with any organization so his daddy was an organization man a priest of an order but he come out of the wilderness dressed for the sheepskin around him hair all over his face instead of being gray it was black what was this man's attraction attracted all jerusalem in judea some of them going out says there's a wild man down there he's trying to drown the people in water whoever heard of such a thing as that others were curious and saying this must be the messiah one of them said it could be one of the prophets they didn't know what to think but what was it it was god fulfilling isaiah authority where he said behold what he would do in the last days i would send his servant what he would do then we find a few weeks after that that man being so positive of his message until he said there's one standing in among you whose shoes i'm not worthy to bear he will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire as i baptize with water one day an ordinary young man about 30 years old walked down and was baptized and when this man come there was such an attraction by the prophet the prophet acts strange that day the congregation couldn't help from watching the action of that prophet when he was debating with the priests across the river they said god built this altar god told us to do this moses is the prophet we believe moses the sacrifice will never be done away with i can hear john answer back that have not you read in the scripture what daniel the prophet said the daily sacrifice will be done away with that hour has arrived have not you read what isaiah said in the 40th chapter the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord there's two prophecies for me and another thing did not you recognize our prophet 400 years ago malachi when he spoke in the third chapter said behold i send my messenger before my face to prepare the way amen don't you know this fulfills prophecy prophecy was being fulfilled and about that time the prophet turned and said behold there comes a lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world now what's the attraction it's changed from the prophet to his prophecy now notice what comes to pass here comes an ordinary man known of no one a carpenter's son come walking out in the water when john the great prophet said i have need to be baptized with thee why come aside and he said suffer that to be so but as a prophet in the word it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness so he understood the sacrifice had to be washed before presented and he baptized it now there's another attraction takes place when he went up out of the water this prophet who had been so loyal to declare his age in the time he looked up and he saw the heavens open he saw the spirit of god like a dove descending upon him and a voice saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased god was vindicating a prophet's message what was attracting the attention at the journey a brother saying a while ago he was supposed to sing on the hills far away stood an old rugged cross what's the attraction on mount calvary when we see the religious world and condemning and the roman government had sentenced him to death and here he was hanging between two male factors starving for a drink blood running out of his body there he hangs crying my god my god why is i forsaking me and the religious people standing there looking at it little did they know that the prophecy of the old testament was being met right there at calvary that time david himself wrote i fell into the spirit like all prophets he act like it was him david cried in the 22nd psalm my god my god why has thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierce my hands and my feet david speaking like it was him and it wasn't david it was christ in david and yet the very prophecy that went forth of all the different prophets was being fulfilled on mount calvary what's the attraction on mount calvary god fulfilling his word another attraction was on the mount was on the day of pentecost when all of us up there in religious feasts thought they got rid of all the fanatics they hadn't heard from them for 10 days all of a sudden like a beehive they broke out of the top of the building out into the streets of screaming and carrying on what is this what meaneth this are all these men drunk watch and a prophet stood up among them as the order of a prophet should be it said ye man of israel and you that dwell in judea in jerusalem let this be known unto you and hearken in my words these are not drunk like you think they are but this is that amen which is spoken of by the lord to joy the prophet it shall come to pass in the last days i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh that was the attraction the religious people after crucifying the prince of life and everything still didn't see the promise of the coming of the holy spirit the attraction who is this what i mean at this what's the marathon people all mine it's the same today we'll bypass a lot of this to bring it to this hour the same thing is today the same thing is taking place the same questions as what's all that ranking look up and down the street carson michigan to florida from maine to california this morning when i was riding out right afternoon was going down the street wife and i was looking at license on cars that's where i thought of this text what i mean just as it said where the carcass is there the eagles are gathered amen amen i said to my wife honey you remember the last night when i had to say goodbye to everything was dear to me on earth and go into the fields to start something that god had said do you sing that song oh they'll come from the east and the west they come from the lands afar to feast with our king to dine as his guest how blessed these pilgrims are beholding his hallowed face a glow with love divine blessed partakers of his grace had gems in his crown will shine that's what the attraction is the predestinated seed of god who can't do nothing else but follow it means more than life to us take our lives but don't take that what is the attraction god as usual fulfilling his word he's fulfilling the word of zechariah again a prophet zechariah read the ninth verse a while ago when jesus entered his temple riding or into jerusalem riding on a little white donkey the prophecy was fulfilled that zechariah said here it is rejoice greatly old daughters of zion shout out daughters of jerusalem behold i king of coming unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly riding upon an ass and upon the colt the foal of an ass that's what the attraction was at jerusalem at the religious headquarters now we see a last day happening let's just turn a few pages on in zechariah and see what he said about it let's turn over then for the last days that was the middle age let's turn now to the last days and turn over to zechariah the 14th chapter and beginning with the fourth verse and listen and we're going to read down a portion of the scripture about nine verses from four to nine listen close and it is prophesying of his coming the lie states listen close now this is thus saith the lord it's the scripture zechariah 14. remember zechariah 9 what it said and they didn't recognize it now what is it today zechariah 14 speaking of his coming and his speech shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives again which is before jerusalem on the east on the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst thereof towards the east and towards the west and there shall be a very great valley hay for the mountain shall be moved towards the north and half towards the south and you shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mountain shall reach from easel yea ye shall flee like you fled in the days of the earthquake in the days of uzziah the king of judah another earthquake splitting open the earth if you want to follow out a scripture here notice in this fifth verse it applies that the cleaving of the mount of olives is due to an earthquake and this is confirmed by isaiah 29 6 and revelation 16 9. exactly what is it the same prophet told of his first coming seen his second coming notice as in the days of the earthquake see what the earthquakes are doing see the predictions of them and the lord your god shall come and all his saints with thee and it shall come to pass in that day hallelujah in that day the light shall not be clear or dark but it shall be one day with one day which shall be known to the lord not day to night but it shall come to pass that in the evening time it shall be like oh god it shall be light about the evening time same prophet and the people is blind what's the attraction let's read a couple more verses and it shall be in that day that the living water shall go forth from jerusalem half of them towards the pharmacy and half towards the higher sea in the summer and winter shall it be the gospel going forth both jew and gentile and the lord shall be king over the earth in that day and there shall be one lord and his name one it shall be light about the evening time right the way to glory you will surely find in the waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of jesus young and old repent of all your sins the holy ghost will surely enter in the evening light has come it is a fact that god in christ are one see where we're at nations are breaking israel's awakening the signs that our prophets foretold that earthquake to the gentiles to the last day the gentile days numbered with horrors and cumbers return or disperse to your own you're this thing kicked out in these arks carried on new carts get out of there before death strikes you god has confirmed it it shall be sold let us turn over to another scripture in the old testament malachi the fourth chapter and read that little fourth chapter behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea all that do wickly shall bs doubles now this is not that's malcolm 3 was the first coming now here's the next coming even the dr scofield here i certainly don't agree with him in these footnotes but he's got it lined out here right the commission of john the malachi 3 and the second coming of christ and elijah beforehand all the proud shall burn up saith the lord of hosts and it shall lead them neither root nor branch where's the eternal hell in but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing campaigns healing in his wings you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked they shall be ashes under the souls of your feet in that day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts remember the law of moses my servant which i commanded him in horeb for all israel the statues and judgment here's the coming of elijah behold i will send to you elijah the prophet the last closing scripture of the old testament i'll send to you elijah the prophet before the coming of that great and dreadful day of the lord now that couldn't have been john [Music] you
