[53:29] words that the hand of the Lord has
[53:31] taken a hold of
[53:33] us there is no denying that we'll be

[54:08] Lord
[54:10] Jesus we don't take these things for
[54:12] granted
[54:14] Lord sometimes we forget who we truly
[54:17] are and we try to measure our lives with
[54:21] the people of the world the things they
[54:24] have and the things we lack and we
[54:28] forget that there is nothing that is
[54:32] greater than the salvation of our
[54:37] souls we bless you father this morning

[55:30] are gathered in your
[55:31] name you knew before this
[55:34] time that the way of the Gospel is not
[55:37] the popular way and there wouldn't be
[55:39] very many but praise be to God we have
[55:43] made this condition far beyond and we
[55:46] pray the dear Lord Jesus may you come

[58:17] young
[58:18] ladies and um both young and
[58:23] old uh um it was a wonderful play this
[58:30] morning even the
[58:33] professionals before they they begin to
[58:36] act they have a lot of time to
[58:39] practice before they they they actually
[58:42] put something
[58:44] together but for those of you who do not
[58:47] know they had only one
[58:51] rehearsal that was last
[58:53] Wednesday
[58:55] and yesterday was the second and the
[58:59] last rehearsal before this
[59:02] performance and that was a wonderful
[59:04] performance can we just give you
[59:09] that praise
[59:11] God God bless you Sister
[59:13] Naomi brother
[59:17] Ariel this is where you you easily get
[59:19] into trouble when you begin to mention
[59:23] names there somebody says oh he left my
[59:25] name
[59:26] out every brother and every sister that
[59:30] was directly or indirectly involved God
[59:33] bless
[59:37] you
[59:38] we we we we we
[59:41] appreciate the the
[59:45] support and uh the
[59:49] performance you
[59:52] know uh let me also thank the parents
[59:58] because we couldn't get to the children
[59:59] without getting through I mean to the
[1:00:03] parents it's like a mango tree that was
[1:00:06] just behind I mean by the
[1:00:08] roadside and every season when the
[1:00:11] children are passing by and they get
[1:00:13] there and they see this big big mango
[1:00:16] they pick stones and they start throwing
[1:00:20] the stones into the tree and before they
[1:00:22] get one mango down they may have thrown
[1:00:24] 20 ter stones and then they plug down
[1:00:28] the leaves they tear down the back of
[1:00:30] the tree then one day the tree was
[1:00:33] complaining why do you guys do this to
[1:00:35] me I don't like it so the next season
[1:00:39] comes around and here they come again
[1:00:43] very ripe mangoes this time they didn't
[1:00:45] throw stones but they jumped onto the
[1:00:47] tree and they started shaking it the Tre
[1:00:51] said oh you guys are disturbing me I
[1:00:53] don't like that
[1:00:55] and they say it is not our fault it's
[1:00:57] because we have seen something good on
[1:00:59] the
[1:01:01] tree and
[1:01:03] parents we may have Disturbed your
[1:01:07] weekend we may have Disturbed your
[1:01:09] program in one way or the
[1:01:13] other but it is because we have seen
[1:01:15] something good in the
[1:01:17] children and we couldn't get to the
[1:01:19] children without getting through you so
[1:01:22] it's for a good cause praise be to God
[1:01:26] and we love these
[1:01:28] children praise
[1:01:33] God they are a gift of God to this
[1:01:40] assembly I was
[1:01:42] somewhere for a period of
[1:01:46] time and I looked around in the church
[1:01:49] and there were no
[1:01:53] children you know how human beings can
[1:01:56] sometimes
[1:01:59] think and this stupid thought came to
[1:02:03] me that the day all of us the old people
[1:02:08] die in that
[1:02:10] church where lies the
[1:02:17] church there is nothing too hard for the
[1:02:22] Lord the Church of the Living God would
[1:02:26] always go forward nothing will stop
[1:02:28] it but this was a thought that came to
[1:02:31] me and I looked at myself and the rest
[1:02:34] of the Brethren and everybody was
[1:02:37] probably about 50 years
[1:02:40] old and I started doing the
[1:02:46] math but praise be to God I can look at
[1:02:50] the youth
[1:02:53] here
[1:02:55] and I am not
[1:02:57] prophesying but I can just do a simple
[1:03:00] mathematical formula here and I can tell
[1:03:03] that by the grace of God in the next 100
[1:03:07] years we may not be in this building but
[1:03:10] there will be a
[1:03:12] people that will lift that blood Banner
[1:03:15] of Christ very high in this
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:23] assembly
[1:03:25] it
[1:03:33] is it's like a
[1:03:35] relay it's not how good or how fast you
[1:03:38] can run if it is a
[1:03:43] relay us boat so
[1:03:46] far is the fastest man on the
[1:03:50] planet so if there was a
[1:03:53] relay let's say
[1:03:55] 4x4 and then he just ran around the
[1:03:58] field and then came with his stick and
[1:04:01] there was nobody to hand it
[1:04:04] over where lies his
[1:04:09] effort and
[1:04:12] children let me talk to
[1:04:15] you you are not too
[1:04:19] small to live a Godly
[1:04:23] life John the Baptist had the Holy Ghost
[1:04:26] while he was still in his father's
[1:04:28] womb you can have the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:30] live a good Christian Life and be a good
[1:04:33] testimony in your school in your
[1:04:35] neighborhood am
[1:04:38] amen that you not only live a Christian
[1:04:41] Life only when parents your parents are
[1:04:43] around or when there are eyes
[1:04:47] watching but you can get to a place and
[1:04:50] you will live a good Christian
[1:04:53] lifej
[1:04:56] and when you are living a good Christian
[1:04:58] Life it's not only Daddy and Mommy that
[1:05:01] are happy the church is
[1:05:04] happy and guess who is the
[1:05:07] happiest the almighty God is happy that
[1:05:10] he looks down and he sees himself in
[1:05:18] you don't say I am a child I am a
[1:05:23] child
[1:05:27] there is a story coming I'll just
[1:05:28] Reserve that for another
[1:05:30] time you are not children you are
[1:05:33] children yes in one
[1:05:35] sense but what you know by the grace of
[1:05:38] God there are 50 60 year old men out
[1:05:42] there who do not know
[1:05:45] it and to whom much is given much I be
[1:05:53] required
[1:05:55] don't just say it's Sunday it's
[1:05:57] Wednesday they are dragging me to church
[1:06:02] again let it be a joy to live by the
[1:06:05] word let it be a joy when you hear there
[1:06:08] is service that you are coming to
[1:06:11] worship God and you are not coming
[1:06:13] because they are forcing you to come or
[1:06:15] they are dragging you that you have to
[1:06:17] go at all
[1:06:20] costs let it be a joy to be in the house
[1:06:23] of God
[1:06:28] praise the lord we are blessed when we
[1:06:31] look at our lives and we see what God
[1:06:34] has done for us where he has taken us
[1:06:37] from his grace upon us his Divine
[1:06:40] protection his love his mercies we are
[1:06:43] blessed and what can we give to God in
[1:06:49] return like a man that was in his 70
[1:06:52] years he took ill and he went to the
[1:06:56] hospital he was admitted for some days
[1:06:59] and when he got
[1:07:01] discharged and they brought him his bill
[1:07:03] the bill was
[1:07:05] itemized food let's say
[1:07:09] $100 um water let's say $20 and then he
[1:07:14] got to
[1:07:16] oxygen they put oxygen on him and then
[1:07:20] they put the bill there and then when he
[1:07:22] saw it he started
[1:07:24] crying so the people came and said oh
[1:07:28] what is going
[1:07:29] on we can help you if you don't have the
[1:07:32] money to pay he said I have the money he
[1:07:35] said I am over 70 years
[1:07:38] old and I have never paid any bill for
[1:07:42] the oxygen I breathe every day for over
[1:07:46] 70 years I come to this hospital for
[1:07:49] just a week and look at the bill I have
[1:07:52] been given for oxygen
[1:07:55] he said I have never paid anything to
[1:07:57] God and he started
[1:08:00] crying I mean as a Christian yes you
[1:08:03] ought to
[1:08:05] pay your tithes and your
[1:08:11] offering aside
[1:08:14] that aside that God does not need
[1:08:17] anything he has G I mean for the
[1:08:19] blessings that he has given
[1:08:22] you
[1:08:25] how much can you pay
[1:08:30] God for his mercies how much
[1:08:33] money for his grace how much money for
[1:08:37] salvation how much
[1:08:39] money how much money can you pay God all
[1:08:43] God needs a
[1:08:47] return to live a life of
[1:08:52] appreciation to live a life of
[1:08:56] appreciation that because of what the
[1:08:58] grace of God has done for me even though
[1:09:01] I have the right to live this life I am
[1:09:03] not going to live that life but I have
[1:09:05] chosen to walk in the path that the Lord
[1:09:09] has ordained for
[1:09:10] me to take God at his word and live by
[1:09:14] his
[1:09:15] word the Bible says that obedience is
[1:09:19] better than sacrifice and to hear King
[1:09:22] than the fat of rams
[1:09:25] if you do not take God at his word and
[1:09:28] if you don't live by the word it doesn't
[1:09:31] matter what you do whatever sacrifices
[1:09:33] you bring to God it stinks before his
[1:09:45] nous God has not delivered
[1:09:49] us so we can walk right
[1:09:52] back in into that mess
[1:09:59] again it's a total
[1:10:04] Deliverance complete and total
[1:10:17] Deliverance praise the Lord amen we are
[1:10:21] blessed that in this and
[1:10:25] age where people have itchy
[1:10:31] ears and people all over are preaching
[1:10:34] Prosperity
[1:10:36] Gospel that God has given us man that
[1:10:40] can look at your that can look into your
[1:10:42] face eyeball to eyeball and tell you
[1:10:45] what you need to hear not what you want
[1:10:47] to hear
[1:10:50] amen a friend went to church I don't
[1:10:53] know why but some sometimes when they go
[1:10:54] to church when they come to work they
[1:10:55] want me to know he came to church he
[1:10:57] said Dan guess what I went to church
[1:10:59] last Sunday I said that is very
[1:11:02] good I went to my wife then he was
[1:11:04] describing the church I said I didn't
[1:11:07] even know where he was what church he
[1:11:09] was talking about and he said but you
[1:11:11] know what they never read the
[1:11:14] Bible and I looked at the church it's a
[1:11:16] very small church so it looks like they
[1:11:18] are looking for
[1:11:22] people I said they never read the Bible
[1:11:25] he said
[1:11:27] no can you imagine going to church and
[1:11:31] the Bible is never right then what else
[1:11:35] is the preacher going to present to the
[1:11:39] people what
[1:11:41] else what
[1:11:46] else so I was telling him you know what
[1:11:49] I'm going to give you my address the
[1:11:50] church address he said no I'm going with
[1:11:52] my father-in-law to his church I said
[1:11:55] okay that is fine I'm not stopping you
[1:11:57] but I'll give you an address I I'll go
[1:11:59] with the wife again I said
[1:12:02] okay that is
[1:12:05] fine praise be to God
[1:12:09] Amen when God delivers
[1:12:13] you God has an
[1:12:15] expectation for your
[1:12:19] life God wants you to distance yourself
[1:12:23] from anything and everything that is
[1:12:25] contrary to his word and God wants you
[1:12:28] to take him by his
[1:12:30] word not when it seems
[1:12:34] convenient even in the most inconvenient
[1:12:38] times God wants you to stand for his
[1:12:41] word
[1:12:45] hallelujah God hates hypocracy
[1:12:50] when you go through the scriptures
[1:12:54] he was very linear to the
[1:12:56] Sinners but when it comes to the
[1:13:00] Hypocrites he was very very hard on
[1:13:04] them the
[1:13:06] Pharisees read the
[1:13:12] scriptures so we are a free
[1:13:16] people we are free indeed whosoever the
[1:13:20] son shall set free shall be free indeed
[1:13:24] we are free and the Bible says there is
[1:13:26] Liberty in the house of God and we are
[1:13:29] the house of God we are for God dwells
[1:13:33] not in temples made of human hands know
[1:13:36] ye not that ye are the Temple of the
[1:13:38] Holy
[1:13:39] Ghost we are the Temple of the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost and when God has delivered you he
[1:13:52] has an expectation
[1:13:54] for your
[1:13:55] life with that Liberty also comes
[1:14:01] responsibility God does not deliver you
[1:14:03] so you live a reckless
[1:14:08] life God wants to see that
[1:14:13] token in your
[1:14:18] life that you live a
[1:14:21] life that people around you would look
[1:14:23] at you and know that indeed God has
[1:14:28] visited
[1:14:30] you a lot of the times we talk too
[1:14:33] much and we don't have the life to back
[1:14:36] it up it is not what you
[1:14:40] say is the life you
[1:14:44] live you can say all you need to say or
[1:14:47] all you want to say if your life does
[1:14:50] not back it that life is used less until
[1:14:53] you meet Christ
[1:15:00] am there were three friends three ladies
[1:15:06] friends and they would just go and steal
[1:15:08] in the super a store a a very big store
[1:15:11] they very very small things that are
[1:15:13] very expensive hide and bring it out and
[1:15:15] go and
[1:15:16] sell one met Christ and he said I am not
[1:15:20] going to do that
[1:15:22] anymore
[1:15:23] for a while the other friends were able
[1:15:28] to accommodate
[1:15:30] her and then it got to that point they
[1:15:33] said you know
[1:15:35] what we will not go still and then you
[1:15:38] sit down here and benefit from
[1:15:42] it you either join us or you have to
[1:15:46] leave and she had no place to
[1:15:49] go the pressure was so high
[1:15:53] that one day she decided to try
[1:15:57] it she also went took
[1:16:01] something she brought it out all
[1:16:04] right but guess what she couldn't sell
[1:16:09] it her heart condemned her so
[1:16:14] much that she told her friends no I need
[1:16:17] to carry this thing back and they said
[1:16:18] you know what if you carry it back you
[1:16:20] are you are going to prison she said I
[1:16:22] don't care I am carrying back anyhow and
[1:16:25] she went there to the security said I
[1:16:28] came here and I stole these
[1:16:30] things but my heart has condemned me so
[1:16:33] much I'm bringing them back he said you
[1:16:34] did what said I came here and I stole
[1:16:37] them when she said
[1:16:39] today they call the supervisor come and
[1:16:43] listen to this
[1:16:44] woman tell your story I came and I saw
[1:16:47] these things but my heart has condemned
[1:16:49] me so much I'm bringing them
[1:16:52] back
[1:16:54] and then they took it then the owner of
[1:16:55] the store said you know
[1:16:59] what we are taking this things back but
[1:17:02] then we want to work with
[1:17:04] you we want to give you an employment
[1:17:07] here to work with
[1:17:10] us she finally accepted it before she
[1:17:14] got back to her place her tee were
[1:17:17] outside the friends were not ready to
[1:17:19] talk to her
[1:17:21] anymore she picked the te
[1:17:24] went away she finally got her place she
[1:17:28] was working gamefully employed one
[1:17:32] day she comes to the
[1:17:35] friends and they said no we don't need
[1:17:37] you here anymore she said no I need to
[1:17:40] talk to you guys she said no we have
[1:17:41] nothing to do with you she went away she
[1:17:44] came back another time they were not
[1:17:46] ready to listen but parently they
[1:17:48] listened to
[1:17:49] her and you know
[1:17:52] what even though they threw her out she
[1:17:55] had a place where she took them
[1:17:58] in and she told them you meant it for
[1:18:00] evil but the Lord my God meant it for
[1:18:04] good you threw me out but you know what
[1:18:07] I'm bringing you into under my
[1:18:10] roof she brought them there she never

[1:22:14] spoken who can bread
[1:22:17] prophesy now the title of our message
[1:22:19] this morning is the missing link
[1:22:24] The Missing
[1:22:29] Link somebody will say what a message
[1:22:33] for
[1:22:36] Christmas
[1:22:39] uh morning praise the
[1:22:44] Lord The Missing
[1:22:48] Link
[1:22:51] now just to build a
[1:22:57] foundation in the Garden of
[1:23:01] Eden was Adam and
[1:23:05] Eve there were the only two people the
[1:23:08] two human beings in the
[1:23:11] garden there were no other human
[1:23:14] beings
[1:23:17] apart from Adam and
[1:23:21] Eve
[1:23:24] also in the
[1:23:25] garden were two
[1:23:28] trees the tree of life and the tree of
[1:23:32] knowledge of Good and
[1:23:35] Evil now the tree of life and the tree
[1:23:38] of knowledge of Good and Evil were not
[1:23:41] like any ordinary tree in the
[1:23:45] garden they were
[1:23:49] different they were different they were
[1:23:51] two spiritual
[1:23:54] trees the tree of life is a
[1:23:59] person and the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:24:02] and Evil is a
[1:24:05] person these two trees that were in the
[1:24:09] midst of the
[1:24:11] garden were not
[1:24:14] friends they were not there to work in
[1:24:21] tandem
[1:24:23] there were two opposing
[1:24:28] trees one was an enemy to the
[1:24:31] order and the other was an enemy to the
[1:24:35] other praise the
[1:24:38] Lorden in the garden there was a
[1:24:44] serpent now the Bible says that the
[1:24:49] serpent was the most cunning
[1:24:53] animal there ever was in the garden very
[1:24:58] shrewd
[1:24:59] smart wiser than any other animal in the
[1:25:05] garden and the serpent was an upright
[1:25:10] creature that could work the serpent was
[1:25:14] an
[1:25:15] animal but it had certain human
[1:25:20] characteristics in when sense it was an
[1:25:23] animal in another sense it was
[1:25:27] human because the blood of an animal
[1:25:30] would never mix with the blood of a
[1:25:33] human being but the blood of this
[1:25:36] serpent could mix with the blood of
[1:25:41] man it doesn't matter whether the man is
[1:25:44] blue white green or
[1:25:46] red if I am sick and they give me their
[1:25:48] blood if our blood type is the same my
[1:25:51] body is going to take it
[1:25:53] I'm not going to be at
[1:25:54] risk but my body would not accept an
[1:25:57] animal
[1:26:00] blood but the blood of the
[1:26:05] serpent could
[1:26:08] intermingle with the blood of
[1:26:12] man it tells you how
[1:26:16] close this serpent was to
[1:26:21] men praise be to God Amen I'm just
[1:26:25] setting the
[1:26:28] stage
[1:26:30] now I'm reading
[1:26:32] from Joseph meeting his
[1:26:39] Brethren paragraph
[1:26:41] 92 and
[1:26:47] 93 there had always been a
[1:26:50] conception for if had already lived
[1:26:54] unrighteous I wish I had a marker
[1:27:02] here I know time is not our side praise
[1:27:04] be to God I am just going to skip just a
[1:27:07] few lines now the
[1:27:12] serpent the serpent beguiled the
[1:27:15] woman today men can bring up animal life
[1:27:21] and the closest
[1:27:22] animal they have to the human being is
[1:27:26] the
[1:27:27] chimpanzee they can make him smoke a
[1:27:30] pipe ride a bicycle put on a heart tip
[1:27:34] it that's just like G and wh to a
[1:27:39] horse is
[1:27:42] sound he hasn't no soul he can't think
[1:27:47] thank you
[1:27:49] brother he has not so he can't
[1:27:54] think he can only go by
[1:27:58] sound he doesn't have a
[1:28:02] soul then they got a missing link right
[1:28:06] in between
[1:28:07] here that they never have been able to
[1:28:13] find praise be to God Amen now just look
[1:28:17] at this
[1:28:19] picture that between the man
[1:28:23] and that
[1:28:26] chimpanzee there is a missing
[1:28:28] link right in
[1:28:32] between science has been able to trace
[1:28:35] all the way to the
[1:28:39] chimpanzee but from the chimpan to the
[1:28:43] men there is a missing link right in
[1:28:48] there and science has
[1:28:51] tried many years to find this Missing
[1:28:54] Link and have not been able to find
[1:29:00] it the mark of the
[1:29:06] beast uh 1961 brother Jordan if you can
[1:29:10] put it okay it's already there praise be
[1:29:11] to
[1:29:13] God
[1:29:20] now
[1:29:26] okay let me just uh now we find out that
[1:29:30] the first marking of a human being
[1:29:33] started in Genesis Genesis
[1:29:35] 4:15 God marked
[1:29:38] K of let me drop a little let me drop
[1:29:41] all right
[1:29:43] notice so let's
[1:29:50] go
[1:30:18] okay
[1:30:20] um
[1:30:24] there is something I'm looking for here
[1:30:27] I don't want to take the
[1:30:29] whole thing I'm not finding it but I
[1:30:32] know it's
[1:30:36] here okay so let me just take this
[1:30:40] portion here now
[1:30:43] watch now watch the Bible said I will
[1:30:48] put
[1:30:49] emry em God did between your
[1:30:54] seed and the Serpent's
[1:30:58] Seed praise the
[1:31:04] Lord
[1:31:05] okay now let's leave it right there now
[1:31:10] science all over the
[1:31:12] years has
[1:31:18] tried to establish this Missing Link
[1:31:23] and has never been
[1:31:27] able and where signs
[1:31:30] spiled religion took
[1:31:38] over science
[1:31:41] says that there is no
[1:31:45] God they try to prove the very to to to
[1:31:50] disprove the very existence of God
[1:31:53] and they will tell you that human beings
[1:31:55] evolved from a lower form of life till
[1:31:59] where we are now now when you look at
[1:32:03] evolution in any
[1:32:05] form creatures that evolve from one
[1:32:08] stage to the other they are still
[1:32:11] evolving that has not changed it has not
[1:32:14] stopped why is it that when it comes to
[1:32:17] human beings that one has to
[1:32:20] stop
[1:32:26] so they try to tell you that there is no
[1:32:31] God and when you outsmart the
[1:32:35] devil when you try to tell the devil
[1:32:38] there is a
[1:32:39] God then he knows that he can't handle
[1:32:43] you in that
[1:32:44] basket so now he gives you a
[1:32:48] religion now note religion does does not
[1:32:52] deny the existence of
[1:32:57] God religion tells you there is a
[1:33:00] God but he gives you what
[1:33:04] Trinity that there are three
[1:33:10] Gods if he can get you
[1:33:13] there he doesn't have to worry his head
[1:33:15] anymore
[1:33:18] amen but if you are too smart for that
[1:33:22] and you believe that God is one here oh
[1:33:26] Israel the Lord our God is one and you
[1:33:29] believe in the Oneness of God he tells
[1:33:31] you
[1:33:32] Yes actually God is
[1:33:35] one God is one but do you
[1:33:38] know um T have
[1:33:45] changed that you can have a form of
[1:33:49] godliness that you are a Christian
[1:33:52] and yet you deny the power
[1:33:56] thereof that is what religion will do to
[1:34:00] anybody that you believe that God is one
[1:34:03] but the days of Miracles are over you
[1:34:06] believe that God is
[1:34:07] one but the Holy Ghost is not for you
[1:34:11] you believe that God is
[1:34:13] one but God is love and God will never
[1:34:15] destroy anything and that is okay you
[1:34:18] can go to the nightclub you can go and
[1:34:20] do anything you want to do you can go to
[1:34:22] the drinking par you can drink and smoke
[1:34:24] and do anything and God is love and it
[1:34:27] is
[1:34:33] okay praise the Lord amen so what the
[1:34:37] devil fails to get
[1:34:41] you in
[1:34:44] science what he
[1:34:46] does is
[1:34:48] that he tries to capture you
[1:34:52] in
[1:34:54] religion religion has never saved any
[1:34:58] man brother Bram says Cain was very
[1:35:04] religious he believed in the Oneness of
[1:35:07] God you couldn't even give Kain three
[1:35:09] gos you
[1:35:15] couldn't he believed in the existence of
[1:35:20] God
[1:35:22] but
[1:35:23] Kain was
[1:35:27] religious
[1:35:31] now one thing we can all give the devil
[1:35:34] credit
[1:35:36] for is that he is full of
[1:35:39] lies and
[1:35:43] deceit that is why you don't reason
[1:35:46] anything out with the
[1:35:48] Devil the devil is so so so so
[1:35:54] smart you don't reason with the
[1:35:58] devil he can just turn your head around
[1:36:02] your shoulder and bring it back here and
[1:36:04] tell you you are looking forward and
[1:36:06] you'll believe it it takes the grace of
[1:36:10] God he deceived to tears of
[1:36:14] angels to go to war against God in the
[1:36:20] garden when God told Adam and
[1:36:24] Eve you would never eat of that fruit in
[1:36:27] the midst of the garden that tree the
[1:36:29] day you eat of it that day you will
[1:36:31] surely die he comes and he tells them
[1:36:33] you will not surely die and they
[1:36:36] believed it if Eve believed it if out of
[1:36:40] it and finally Adam we all know the
[1:36:44] story so lies and deceit have always
[1:36:49] worked for the devil
[1:36:52] it is the devil's best
[1:36:55] weapon it has not
[1:36:58] failed what worked for him
[1:37:01] yesterday is still working for him
[1:37:06] today and true lies and
[1:37:09] deceit he has brought the church to
[1:37:12] Revelations
[1:37:14] 3 if we can turn our Bibles to
[1:37:16] Revelation
[1:37:20] 3
[1:37:27] 17 and
[1:37:34] 18 Revelations 3:17 and
[1:37:44] 18 let's take from
[1:37:48] 15 I Know Thy works that thou art
[1:37:51] neither cold or H I would thou were cold
[1:37:55] or H so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[1:37:59] and neither cold nor hot I will spill
[1:38:01] thee out of my mouth because thou sayest
[1:38:04] I am rich and increased with goose and
[1:38:07] have need of nothing and knoweth not
[1:38:10] that thou art wretched and M and
[1:38:12] miserable and poor and blind and naked I
[1:38:15] Cel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire
[1:38:19] that thou mayest be rich and white rant
[1:38:24] that thou mayest be
[1:38:26] clothed and that the nakedness and and
[1:38:30] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:38:32] appear and anoint th eyes with i s that
[1:38:36] thou mayest see
[1:38:39] now religion has brought man to a place
[1:38:44] why he thinks that he knows it all when
[1:38:48] he doesn't know
[1:38:50] it why he thinks that he has it when he
[1:38:54] doesn't have
[1:38:57] it and that is a dangerous place for
[1:39:00] anybody to ever
[1:39:03] be it is better to deal with a stone
[1:39:06] hard on
[1:39:08] believer somebody that is worshiping
[1:39:11] stones and
[1:39:13] rivers is better to deal with a person
[1:39:16] like that than to deal with somebody
[1:39:19] that has half of the
[1:39:24] truth because you can't teach them
[1:39:28] anything because they think they have it
[1:39:34] already you talk about going to church
[1:39:37] oh yes I go to church every Sunday I go
[1:39:39] to church every Wednesday you talk about
[1:39:41] reading your Bible oh I read my Bible
[1:39:44] every morning you talk about prayer oh I
[1:39:47] pray every day what is it that you are
[1:39:49] going to say that would convince them
[1:39:53] so when the devil actually gets you down
[1:39:57] to that
[1:39:58] spot why you don't have what you think
[1:40:01] you have the devil doesn't have to fight
[1:40:03] you anymore he knows that the work is
[1:40:08] done and that is why the
[1:40:11] devil has brought this lisian church
[1:40:18] age that the people are naked
[1:40:22] and they think they are
[1:40:24] clothed they are blind but they think
[1:40:27] they can
[1:40:28] see they are poor but they said they are
[1:40:33] rich they are
[1:40:35] miserable but they say oh we have
[1:40:40] joy and because of that they refuse the
[1:40:43] counsel of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:47] amen which says I counsel thee
[1:40:51] to buy of me gold red in
[1:40:54] fire that you may be rich and on and on
[1:40:58] and on and
[1:41:01] on remember we are talking about the
[1:41:05] missing
[1:41:06] link 12:32 we are talking about the
[1:41:10] missing
[1:41:14] link it just struck me that what I was
[1:41:17] looking for was
[1:41:19] probably uh um I'm not going to go back
[1:41:23] to it we are just going to go
[1:41:25] forward praise the
[1:41:32] Lord
[1:41:34] but no matter what you are
[1:41:39] doing no matter where you think you
[1:41:44] stand if the grace of God can open your
[1:41:48] eyes to
[1:41:49] see
[1:41:51] is good to submit your will to the will
[1:41:55] of God
[1:41:59] am the
[1:42:01] automaker made a car and they gave it a
[1:42:04] reverse
[1:42:06] GE that when you enter a ditch you can
[1:42:10] just engage the reverse J and get
[1:42:15] out and the same applies to our
[1:42:19] lives that in this
[1:42:21] journey in this journey you are going to
[1:42:25] engage your reverse year a lot of the
[1:42:28] times
[1:42:32] true if you don't have a reversed
[1:42:35] Year God have
[1:42:41] mercy we are here to help one
[1:42:46] another to support one another in
[1:42:49] prayer it doesn't matter matter whether
[1:42:51] young or old father or mother children
[1:42:53] it doesn't really
[1:42:56] matter you should be able to grow in the
[1:42:59] love of
[1:43:01] God in the word of God get to a place
[1:43:04] that when the brother says I am weak I
[1:43:06] can't go on anymore you should be able
[1:43:08] to put your short brother we are going
[1:43:12] anyhow the Bible says the righteous
[1:43:14] shall fall seven times and rise up
[1:43:17] again if you fall you will not make that
[1:43:20] place your resting place because you
[1:43:22] will never be comfortable there that is
[1:43:25] not where you are called to
[1:43:27] be you are called to be a son and a
[1:43:30] daughter of
[1:43:32] God praise the Lord amen that when Daddy
[1:43:37] or Mommy gets to a place and says son or
[1:43:39] daughter you know what I can't go on
[1:43:41] anymore they said no mommy daddy we are
[1:43:45] going anyhow Hallelujah you used to drag
[1:43:47] me to church it's my time to drag you
[1:43:50] now amen praise be to
[1:43:53] God praise the
[1:44:00] Lord in this
[1:44:03] journey you are going to engage your
[1:44:05] reverse year a lot of the
[1:44:10] times it's only a
[1:44:13] fool that will enter a
[1:44:17] ditch and then just keep raming up the
[1:44:19] engine
[1:44:22] like I said one time if I was driving
[1:44:26] and any of my children was driving
[1:44:27] behind
[1:44:29] me and I enter a
[1:44:32] swamp oh I love my daddy so much he
[1:44:36] enter a SW at 80 M hour let me go 90 and
[1:44:40] join him in the ditch who does
[1:44:45] that who does that even if by mistake
[1:44:49] you go off your Lan and you enter the
[1:44:52] swamp you want to reverse and get
[1:45:01] out if the church can get you if if the
[1:45:04] devil can get you to be as
[1:45:08] religious and look so
[1:45:11] sanctimonious and look so
[1:45:14] holy and deny the power of God you're
[1:45:18] coming to church and reading your Bible
[1:45:19] and praying would not help you in any
[1:45:24] way he is the same yesterday today and
[1:45:27] forever he has not
[1:45:31] changed what he did yesterday under some
[1:45:35] specific conditions he will do that
[1:45:37] today again under the same
[1:45:39] condition the Lord Our God has not
[1:45:44] changed and never think never think that
[1:45:49] God has brought you this far to abandon
[1:45:54] you that is the voice of the devil if
[1:45:57] you ever tell yourself you ever hear a
[1:46:00] voice tell you that you are not going to
[1:46:01] make it that is the
[1:46:04] devil you think God will send his son to
[1:46:07] come and die and then he will just turn
[1:46:09] around and deny you
[1:46:11] salvation or you think God will tell you
[1:46:15] that when your neighbor offends you 7
[1:46:17] times 49 7 times 70 times forgive and
[1:46:21] then you offend God and he holds it
[1:46:22] against
[1:46:23] you God would not tell you to do
[1:46:26] something that he would not
[1:46:30] do don't let the devil hold you
[1:46:34] back whether with one arm or one leg we
[1:46:37] are going
[1:46:38] anyhow we are
[1:46:40] unstoppable the devil cannot stop us
[1:46:45] amen by the grace of God we have made it
[1:46:49] amen
[1:46:51] the lion have
[1:46:53] R who will not fear the lord God has
[1:46:56] spoken who can but prophesy the Bible
[1:47:00] says we already seated in Heavenly
[1:47:02] places places through Christ Jesus we
[1:47:05] have made it when God speaks it is
[1:47:09] settled
[1:47:10] amen it doesn't matter what it is for
[1:47:13] the future it is settled amen it's just
[1:47:17] like climbing a mountain Everest I know
[1:47:20] it is the tallest mountain
[1:47:24] right praise the Lord amen and then you
[1:47:27] stand at the Pinnacle of that mountain
[1:47:29] and you hold this phone and then you let
[1:47:32] go of it you don't stand to see whether
[1:47:35] the phone is going to fall or
[1:47:37] not when God speaks he doesn't wait to
[1:47:41] see whether it is going to be
[1:47:43] accomplished or not it is
[1:47:46] settled yes if we can get to that place
[1:47:50] to take God by his
[1:47:52] word praise be to God our lives would
[1:47:55] never be the same
[1:47:59] again why do you doubt
[1:48:03] God has he said it and has not done
[1:48:08] it why are you
[1:48:15] double-minded you can never receive
[1:48:17] anything from God if you are
[1:48:19] double-minded
[1:48:22] nothing that is according to the word of
[1:48:26] God a double-minded man is unstable in
[1:48:30] all his
[1:48:31] ways and you cannot receive anything
[1:48:33] from
[1:48:37] God if you purpose in your
[1:48:41] heart that you are going to live for God
[1:48:44] God
[1:48:46] knows and that is the type of man the
[1:48:49] type of of woman God is looking
[1:48:56] for not somebody who build
[1:48:59] Bridges and then has come to try so if
[1:49:03] things don't work I'm going back you are
[1:49:05] not ready
[1:49:12] yet praise the
[1:49:16] Lord I don't have my notes but somehow
[1:49:19] things are going to work out praise the
[1:49:26] Lord
[1:49:28] now after the
[1:49:33] fall there was a great conference in the
[1:49:37] Garden of
[1:49:39] Eden that God came
[1:49:44] down and he called a
[1:49:48] conference in that conference
[1:49:53] he told a
[1:49:54] woman in childbearing she's going to
[1:49:57] have sorrow and for Adam's sake the
[1:50:00] ground was cursed but when he came to
[1:50:02] the to to the serpent he said you are
[1:50:06] cast above every animal and above every
[1:50:11] beast of the field and upon thy belly
[1:50:14] thou shall go and dust thou shall eat
[1:50:18] all the days of their
[1:50:23] life and he went on to
[1:50:26] say that the seed of the woman would
[1:50:30] bruise thy
[1:50:33] head now the serpent was not a
[1:50:39] snake as religion makes us to
[1:50:44] understand religion has given us E and
[1:50:48] has given us an apple tree and there is
[1:50:50] a snake on the side and the snake has
[1:50:53] taken an apple and given it to Eve I
[1:50:56] know by the grace of God we are all
[1:50:57] above that now
[1:51:01] amen the serpent was an upright creature
[1:51:05] that was
[1:51:06] cursed the Cur took off every limp the
[1:51:10] hands and the feet and broke every bone
[1:51:14] the was in it and gave it the nature you
[1:51:17] see
[1:51:18] today
[1:51:22] the case made it
[1:51:26] so and S has been looking for The
[1:51:29] Missing Link all these
[1:51:32] years and they have taken the snake and
[1:51:35] they have examined it is vertebrae the
[1:51:38] everything in it and they can't see any
[1:51:40] link between the snake and that missing
[1:51:44] L they can't see it why because it is
[1:51:48] hidden from the ey eyes of the wise and
[1:51:50] The Prudent and revealed to babes such
[1:51:55] as you and me hallelujah praise be to
[1:51:58] God Amen it can't take signs signs
[1:52:01] cannot prove the existence of
[1:52:04] God how do you prove God if you get to a
[1:52:08] place to prove God then God is no God
[1:52:18] anymore he has spoken who can but
[1:52:25] prophesy in Isaiah
[1:52:28] 9
[1:52:30] six the Bible says unto us a child is
[1:52:34] born unto us a son is given and the g
[1:52:38] shall be upon his
[1:52:40] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[1:52:43] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[1:52:46] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:52:50] praise be to God
[1:52:57] am people were
[1:53:00] wondering how can a virgin
[1:53:05] conceive it's
[1:53:07] unscientific it's unscientific how can a
[1:53:10] virgin somebody that has no know how can
[1:53:13] a virgin
[1:53:18] conceive just like in the Book of
[1:53:22] Genesis when God said the the the seed
[1:53:26] of the woman will breath the head of the
[1:53:29] serpent they were wondering the seed of
[1:53:32] the woman a woman has no seed what is
[1:53:35] God talking
[1:53:36] about because when you
[1:53:39] take any form of
[1:53:43] reproduction whether plant or
[1:53:45] animal the seed comes from the
[1:53:48] male and you are talking about the seed
[1:53:51] of the woman that was a mystery and then
[1:53:54] here you are talking of um you are
[1:53:56] talking
[1:53:57] of a virgin shall conceive that is a
[1:54:02] mystery that was why when the
[1:54:06] angel came to Mary if we can read Luke
[1:54:11] 1:28 when the angel came to Mary Mary
[1:54:15] herself was
[1:54:18] shocked
[1:54:21] Matthew 1
[1:54:25] 28 and the angel came unto her and said
[1:54:30] hail
[1:54:31] thou um said hail Thou Art highly
[1:54:37] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[1:54:40] art thou amongst
[1:54:43] women and when she saw him she was
[1:54:47] troubled at his saying and as her mind
[1:54:51] what manner of salutation is this what
[1:54:53] manner of salutation this should be
[1:54:56] praise the Lord amen you can actually
[1:54:59] even put I mean put yourself in in in in
[1:55:02] her
[1:55:03] shoes sometimes people people people say
[1:55:07] things about you and sometimes you tend
[1:55:10] to see whether maybe they are referring
[1:55:12] to somebody else because you look at
[1:55:15] yourself and you you know you are just
[1:55:18] an ordinary person
[1:55:20] and they are just giving you that
[1:55:22] salutation you don't you don't belong
[1:55:24] there and she was wondering what type of
[1:55:27] salutation is
[1:55:28] this verse 30 and the angel said unto
[1:55:31] her fear not Mary for thou has found
[1:55:35] favor with God like any of us can say
[1:55:38] today we have found favor with God it is
[1:55:41] not our good works it is not our good
[1:55:44] intentions it's not our best behaviors
[1:55:47] we are not the best of people out there
[1:55:50] as a matter of fact there are people out
[1:55:52] there when they should put us against
[1:55:55] them on the same scale is going to tip
[1:55:58] in their
[1:56:03] favor God doesn't care about your
[1:56:06] morals he comes after you anyhow but
[1:56:10] after he has redeemed
[1:56:12] you now he
[1:56:16] cares how can you prove to God
[1:56:21] or prove to your
[1:56:23] neighbor or prove to your brother or
[1:56:25] your sister that indeed you have met
[1:56:28] God that indeed you have taken God as
[1:56:31] his word and you are living by the word
[1:56:33] and yet still do the same things you
[1:56:35] used to
[1:56:37] do or maybe sometimes even worse than
[1:56:41] they are
[1:56:44] doing the word of God must take effect
[1:56:47] in your life they should you see that
[1:56:57] difference God didn't come for us
[1:56:59] because we had good morals has nothing
[1:57:02] to do with
[1:57:04] it but after God has saved
[1:57:08] you in
[1:57:13] spite of whatever life it was God
[1:57:16] expects you to take his word live by his
[1:57:21] word and be cleansed and become an
[1:57:24] example an
[1:57:28] example to people around
[1:57:32] you we have found favor in the sight of
[1:57:38] God there is no question about
[1:57:41] it but after you have found favor with
[1:57:44] God what do you do with this
[1:57:48] word what what do you do with the word
[1:57:50] of
[1:57:52] God 31 and behold thou shall conceive in
[1:57:55] thy womb and bring forth a son and shall
[1:57:58] call his name Jesus he shall be great
[1:58:02] and shall be called the son of the
[1:58:04] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[1:58:08] him the Throne of his father David and
[1:58:11] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:58:14] forever and of the kingdom and of his
[1:58:18] kingdom there be no end then said Mary
[1:58:22] unto the angel how shall this be seeing
[1:58:26] I know not a
[1:58:27] man and the angel answer and said unto
[1:58:30] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[1:58:35] and the power of the highest shall
[1:58:38] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[1:58:42] thing who shall be born of thee shall be
[1:58:45] called The Son of God praise be to God
[1:58:49] Amen
[1:58:52] the seed of the woman that crushes the
[1:58:55] head of the serpent is Christ
[1:59:05] Jesus he was virgin
[1:59:09] born the Holy Ghost overshadowed
[1:59:12] Mary and Mary took
[1:59:17] seed it was on
[1:59:20] scientific there is no way
[1:59:23] science could ever establish
[1:59:28] that the missing
[1:59:31] link The Missing
[1:59:34] Link
[1:59:39] now from the
[1:59:41] message led by the
[1:59:45] spirit led by the
[1:59:48] spirit now we
[1:59:51] realize now we
[1:59:54] realize and everyone knows there is a
[1:59:59] there is
[2:00:00] Spirits then if there is Spirits there
[2:00:04] is bound to be a master of that spirit
[2:00:07] because it changes the nature of Sinners
[2:00:11] into
[2:00:12] Christians and there is bound to be a
[2:00:14] master or
[2:00:16] head there somewhere
[2:00:20] and and and that's
[2:00:23] God and he sent his son on earth made in
[2:00:29] likeness of sinful
[2:00:31] flesh and he died that we might be
[2:00:34] redeemed and brought back to God to be
[2:00:39] Sons and Daughters of God to walk with
[2:00:42] him again that Missing Link from the
[2:00:46] Garden of
[2:00:48] Eden
[2:00:49] what Adam lost Christ restored
[2:00:54] it praise the Lord what Adam lost Christ
[2:01:00] restored it now um I'm reading again
[2:01:04] from the angel of
[2:01:07] God
[2:01:08] 1947 paragraph
[2:01:10] 21 he was the first
[2:01:15] one I don't think I'm reading everything
[2:01:18] here
[2:01:36] excuse me uh let me get my
[2:01:48] phone
[2:01:51] all right I think I have what I'm
[2:01:52] looking for here praise the
[2:01:55] Lord what's the matter with the church
[2:01:58] today that is what I want to know if
[2:02:02] Christ was the missing link between God
[2:02:06] and man and he come to hook God and man
[2:02:10] together again what is the matter
[2:02:14] today is because of
[2:02:17] unbelief
[2:02:19] because of
[2:02:21] unbelief and that was all he came to do
[2:02:24] to restore Adam and
[2:02:27] Eve sorry to restore what
[2:02:32] Adam lost in the
[2:02:35] garden praise be to
[2:02:45] God
[2:02:47] now
[2:02:50] the good
[2:02:53] news if you don't take anything from
[2:02:56] today's service I don't want you to
[2:02:59] forget
[2:03:01] this praise the
[2:03:08] lord we have
[2:03:11] established that the
[2:03:13] devil is very
[2:03:17] deceitful and that has worked for
[2:03:21] him very very
[2:03:25] well so much
[2:03:29] so that
[2:03:34] Matthew
[2:03:39] 24:24 so much
[2:03:42] so that Matthew
[2:03:47] 24:24 says
[2:03:49] for there shall arise false prophets
[2:03:53] false Christ and false prophets and
[2:03:56] shall sheld great signs and wonders in
[2:04:00] so much that if it were
[2:04:02] possible they shall deceive the very
[2:04:08] elect if it were
[2:04:13] possible this bride of Christ will never
[2:04:18] be deceived
[2:04:22] this bride of Christ can never be
[2:04:27] deceived it is just not
[2:04:31] possible now when you look at what
[2:04:34] happened in the garden it was
[2:04:38] Eve and the
[2:04:40] serpent Adam was not on the
[2:04:43] scene all that was going on was between
[2:04:47] Eve and the
[2:04:49] serpent that was
[2:04:51] why if God
[2:04:58] deceived but
[2:05:02] today the second
[2:05:05] Adam and the second
[2:05:08] if Christ and the
[2:05:12] church we are not leaving
[2:05:16] apart Christ is in his church
[2:05:21] not only is he in his church but he's
[2:05:24] also in his
[2:05:26] bride so guess what whenever the enemy
[2:05:30] shows up guess who shows
[2:05:33] up is Christ and not you amen that is
[2:05:39] why you can never be deceived the Church
[2:05:43] of the Living God can never be deceived
[2:05:47] am left to you
[2:05:51] alone nobody is a match for the
[2:05:55] enemy and
[2:05:59] sometimes
[2:06:03] sometimes the devil will just come and
[2:06:06] preach his sermon to you sometimes you
[2:06:08] don't even catch
[2:06:11] yourself before you realize what is
[2:06:13] going on he would have even gotten
[2:06:17] you
[2:06:22] sometimes he will sweep you off your
[2:06:24] feet
[2:06:29] completely but still he doesn't get his
[2:06:31] way why because there is something in
[2:06:35] you that is holding you it is not
[2:06:39] you nobody is a much for the devil but
[2:06:42] there is something in you that keeps
[2:06:44] holding
[2:06:45] you Hallelujah a lot of us can look at
[2:06:48] our
[2:06:50] lives and then we don't even know how we
[2:06:54] have come this far how we made it this
[2:06:56] far we can't
[2:07:00] tell when we get to
[2:07:02] heaven and we begin to tell our
[2:07:06] stories and they ask you brother how did
[2:07:08] you make it sister how did you make
[2:07:11] it you will have no
[2:07:14] worth you will say it's just by his
[2:07:17] grace
[2:07:19] is by his
[2:07:22] grace it is not by might nor by power
[2:07:25] it's by his
[2:07:27] Spirit the Bible says your hand has laid
[2:07:29] the foundation and your hand will
[2:07:31] complete that complete the
[2:07:34] house it's God who has laid the
[2:07:38] foundation it's God who has called us
[2:07:41] it's God who has started the work is God
[2:07:45] who is seeing it through and God will
[2:07:48] bring his work to a completion nothing
[2:07:50] can stop
[2:07:55] it like the thief on the
[2:07:58] cross when we GA on that day and we ask
[2:08:01] the
[2:08:02] thief how did you make it so I don't
[2:08:05] know I don't
[2:08:07] know I was on the cross waiting to
[2:08:11] die and things just
[2:08:16] changed what is the story
[2:08:21] Grace
[2:08:25] Grace sometimes we
[2:08:28] think sometimes we
[2:08:31] think that it's from when we
[2:08:36] believed that God turned his attention
[2:08:39] on us no it's never
[2:08:42] been praise the
[2:08:44] Lord in my life over a period of
[2:08:52] 30 30 something years I've had I've had
[2:08:57] I've had 12 either 11 or 12
[2:09:00] dreams and I'm talking of spiritual
[2:09:04] dreams
[2:09:05] now you would
[2:09:08] think that it is your
[2:09:11] effort you would think that it is your
[2:09:15] ability you would think that it is it is
[2:09:21] you that just got up and decided you
[2:09:24] want to be here this morning
[2:09:27] no the grace of God brought you
[2:09:32] here left on your
[2:09:35] own there are more than 10 20 30 places
[2:09:38] you would want to go this
[2:09:42] morning but you chose to be
[2:09:47] here God is keeping an eye on every one
[2:09:50] of his
[2:09:53] children it is not from the day you
[2:09:59] believed God started performing miracles
[2:10:02] for me when I was a baby I think I told
[2:10:05] that story before when my
[2:10:09] stepmom I was sick I was taken to the
[2:10:11] hospital they gave me medication it was
[2:10:14] in a bottle a baby of according to my
[2:10:17] mom I was I was less than 6 months old
[2:10:20] and then she emptied the
[2:10:22] medicine in the sink and then filled it
[2:10:25] with something else whatever it was
[2:10:28] nobody knew it so a mother's instinct
[2:10:32] she comes and she takes the bottle it's
[2:10:35] time for mommy to give baby the medicine
[2:10:38] and she sees that no it's
[2:10:42] stained it wasn't like
[2:10:45] this and then she empty some in a in in
[2:10:48] a in a in a cup and it was a different
[2:10:52] color you think it was my mother it was
[2:10:54] not my
[2:10:56] mother it was God keeping an eye on this
[2:11:02] guy
[2:11:03] here I told you guys of a story where I
[2:11:07] got drowned completely
[2:11:10] drowned I was supposed to be in school I
[2:11:13] went with a friend it was a dam who went
[2:11:16] and was swimming I just jumped into the
[2:11:18] water and my two legs just something
[2:11:21] just draged me into the under on under
[2:11:23] the
[2:11:25] dam and I was in the water trying to
[2:11:28] shout you know you can't shout in
[2:11:30] water so I was when I open my mouth I
[2:11:33] was drinking
[2:11:35] water the guy was far away on the other
[2:11:38] end of the
[2:11:39] dam how else he got to know that was
[2:11:42] drowning only
[2:11:44] God and a child his age who were age m
[2:11:48] I think I was just about gospel's
[2:11:52] age so if I went to a place and I was
[2:11:55] drowning or somebody his age I went
[2:11:58] there and he was drowning what sense do
[2:12:00] I have to get into the water to bring
[2:12:02] him out I'll be
[2:12:05] running help help help but the boy comes
[2:12:09] in he Dives in and he pulls me
[2:12:12] out you think it was him it was
[2:12:17] God
[2:12:19] and as I said once upon a time I was a
[2:12:23] Muslim I was a
[2:12:28] Muslim one night I got
[2:12:32] up used the restroom came back I lay on
[2:12:36] the bed I was not asleep I was not I was
