[50:43] remember now we're talking about
[50:45] possessing our inheritance
[50:47] you know so we want to speak tonight on
[50:50] possessing our vessel
[50:53] incentivification and honor for
[50:55] possessing our vessel we want to use
[50:57] that
[50:58] they are taught to knight in and were
[51:01] and where they taught goals on on
[51:04] tonight
[51:05] is that i was going i was going to read
[51:07] uh
[51:08] setting biblical historical things to to
[51:11] us tonight but i will i will i will let
[51:14] that
[51:15] let that go for for for the evening
[51:18] and
[51:19] and just
[51:21] try to narrow down on on on this subject
[51:24] that we we
[51:25] want to talk about so where the thought
[51:28] of the whole thing is coming from we
[51:30] have to remember
[51:31] when we talk about possessing our
[51:35] our inheritance
[51:37] we won't think us as a believer that we
[51:40] must remember now you see we started
[51:42] talking about uh
[51:44] crowns and and rewards and
[51:49] and sunday we spoke about
[51:51] you know god rewarding us for whatever
[51:54] we have done in this body what a good or
[51:57] evil
[51:58] now so because uh uh we realized that uh
[52:02] our bodies were giving to us you know
[52:05] god made us important in this body that
[52:08] we have for him to
[52:11] manifest his attribute you know i was i
[52:14] was thinking about while driving to to
[52:17] church tonight
[52:19] uh um
[52:20] i i read i read through commentaries and
[52:23] and and i listened to different you know
[52:26] writers and and thing but i was thinking
[52:29] about it
[52:30] uh uh to realize that when you read
[52:34] through a lot of uh
[52:37] bible commentary
[52:40] people talk about you know
[52:43] the names of god the greatness of god
[52:46] they talk about the the fall you know
[52:49] they talk about
[52:50] you know uh
[52:52] adam position they have many men out
[52:55] there like brother branham says that how
[52:57] wonderful they're having wonderful
[52:59] knowledge god has blessed him i mean
[53:01] they are men that god has blessed to
[53:03] make a lot of research you know that's
[53:05] why brother branham used to appreciate
[53:07] the scoff of this coffee bible you know
[53:10] but
[53:11] uh
[53:12] to be able to grab this understanding of
[53:16] uh
[53:17] uh
[53:18] god wanted to
[53:20] manifest his attributes
[53:23] you know that god there were attributes
[53:26] in god he was a healer he was a savior
[53:29] you know uh
[53:31] a deliverer and and all of these
[53:34] wonderful attributes even he was a judge
[53:37] you know all of this attribute was in
[53:39] the great intent of spirit but being
[53:42] you know uh
[53:43] [Music]
[53:45] an internal spirit the invisible god
[53:48] there is no way that he could manifest
[53:50] uh you know his attributes all of those
[53:53] attributes that were in him so god now
[53:56] have to now turn to
[53:59] creating you know he had to now turn to
[54:01] making his subjects you know create man
[54:04] in his image and and and everything so
[54:07] the great thought that was in his mind
[54:09] and also that he will be able to have
[54:12] the privilege of manifesting his
[54:15] attributes
[54:16] now so uh with all of that taught
[54:20] you know realizing that
[54:23] our body was given to us for the house
[54:25] of god the temple of the living god and
[54:28] uh
[54:30] and all of that
[54:32] and then when we talk about uh
[54:34] possessing our inheritance
[54:37] i don't want you to look very far
[54:40] from yourself
[54:42] i want you to look at possessing this
[54:44] guy
[54:46] amen
[54:48] possessing this guy
[54:50] praise the lord there's uh uh because
[54:54] just like
[54:55] the thought of god
[54:58] you know uh
[54:59] creating us
[55:01] supporting man that he has made as a
[55:03] spirit man
[55:05] coming down to the dust and forming the
[55:07] dust the clad of the earth and and
[55:10] breathing men into that body just the
[55:12] very thought of that you know uh
[55:15] uh
[55:16] make us to realize that god had a
[55:20] purpose for our body
[55:23] praise the lord
[55:25] and if there are
[55:28] a things of god that we will have to
[55:30] enjoy
[55:32] in this life it has to be in this body
[55:35] now if you were sick tonight you will
[55:37] not be sitting down yet
[55:38] i mean if you were seriously sick
[55:40] tonight uh on uh uh you know uh you know
[55:44] at home uh uh i mean uh you you get to
[55:47] that place where i mean you're shaking
[55:50] and especially when you love to be in
[55:52] the house of god you think about it's
[55:54] wednesday night oh i wish i was there or
[55:56] sunday you know and and all of that you
[55:59] know so when we have limitation in this
[56:02] body it's hard for us to be able to
[56:05] enjoy the full
[56:07] you know blessings the full you know uh
[56:10] uh things that god want to achieve in
[56:13] this body
[56:14] praise the lord so you see where we we
[56:17] we trying to go with this thought
[56:20] uh is is uh is to bring us to the place
[56:23] to realize that
[56:25] you know what god
[56:27] has has
[56:29] he has invited us he has
[56:33] invited us for us to be
[56:35] co-workers with him
[56:37] praise the lord he wants for us to join
[56:40] him and in a way of uh enjoying his
[56:45] blessings in this body he want us to
[56:48] join him in a way of subjecting this
[56:51] body of ours to uh to the word of god
[56:55] because we have to realize that uh
[56:58] uh we we we are born on a same nature we
[57:02] are born on uh
[57:04] uh uh the fault of of our father adam
[57:08] you know so with that with that
[57:12] we realize we are born into the word you
[57:14] know born coming into the world speaking
[57:16] lies so there is a sin nature that we
[57:19] are born with that
[57:20] that is always
[57:22] wanting us or wanting to rob us of
[57:26] enjoying the full blessings of god but
[57:28] you see that is the beautiful picture
[57:30] because god is not living there unto you
[57:32] to be able to do it but he's making
[57:35] himself a partner with you to help us to
[57:38] be able to come to that place and bring
[57:42] the same nature on the suggestion to god
[57:45] amen
[57:46] so uh uh
[57:48] that is just a way of trying to explain
[57:50] what is on my mind to you tonight so as
[57:53] paul talks about this uh
[57:56] uh
[57:57] this thought of possessing
[57:59] our vessels
[58:01] you know
[58:02] uh i thought about god giving abraham
[58:06] the promise of possessing the gates of
[58:08] the enemy
[58:10] praise the lord
[58:12] and uh uh you know and and joshua and
[58:16] and and the spires going to the promised
[58:18] land you know and and possessing their
[58:21] inheritance and driving out uh you know
[58:24] the canaanites and and all the knights
[58:27] that were there amen
[58:29] the jebusites and all of those guys that
[58:31] were in the promised land god sending
[58:33] caleb and joshua and the men of israel
[58:36] to go and possess the slain but you see
[58:38] in all that god was doing
[58:41] the thought that was behind god's mind
[58:45] was coming to us
[58:49] praise the lord
[58:50] amen was coming to us in the sense that
[58:54] we we we don't have a physical land
[58:57] amen
[58:58] we're not going to to fight against
[59:01] another nation we are not going to fight
[59:03] against another tribe or uh no
[59:06] he was he was laying principle he was
[59:09] laying shadows in in the scriptures so
[59:12] when it comes to our time we will
[59:15] realize that we have a land and it's
[59:18] this body
[59:19] amen we have a land that uh god wants us
[59:23] to be able to enjoy his blessings within
[59:28] praise the lord
[59:29] he wants you uh uh as a young man to be
[59:33] able to find bring yourself in obedience
[59:36] to god's word you know when and and uh
[59:39] when now you are in obedience to god's
[59:41] word and now you have the grace to be
[59:43] able to make a choice you know uh a
[59:46] choice for work even choice for family
[59:49] you know
[59:50] i mean if you don't if you don't have
[59:52] yours you you know you don't have
[59:54] yourself on the suggestion to god's word
[59:57] how are you going to rule your home
[1:00:01] praise the lord
[1:00:03] how are you going to rule your home
[1:00:07] and even as a young woman
[1:00:09] so you see all the promises
[1:00:12] you talk about you think about the
[1:00:14] guiding of eating and and and before sin
[1:00:17] came in and adam and eve living peaceful
[1:00:20] you know and all of that you think about
[1:00:22] all the promises and the blessing you
[1:00:25] know that is that that god speaks about
[1:00:27] in his word and and uh uh for us to be
[1:00:31] able to enjoy it i mean it's not just uh
[1:00:34] uh uh uh stories for us to read you know
[1:00:38] and just and justice our mind it's a
[1:00:41] reality
[1:00:42] the holy ghost is real
[1:00:45] the promises of god are real
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:49] god is able to bring you you see when i
[1:00:52] when i read that uh
[1:00:54] a portion of the statistics that i read
[1:00:57] on sunday morning like i said i was
[1:00:59] using that as a bed
[1:01:01] you know to be able to to to grab your
[1:01:03] attention and and and draw you into what
[1:01:06] i wanted to speak about but you see uh
[1:01:09] we realized that uh
[1:01:11] uh uh
[1:01:12] you know is is the order of the day you
[1:01:15] see the life of young people you see
[1:01:18] family life you know uh uh being
[1:01:20] distraught in and and and all of that is
[1:01:23] it even sometimes it makes
[1:01:26] uh young people you know without the
[1:01:28] spirit of god they are so afraid what
[1:01:30] what to do you know try to imagine what
[1:01:32] the future is going to be
[1:01:35] but uh
[1:01:36] god is faithful amen
[1:01:38] just like i said we cannot say amen to
[1:01:40] that because that is statistics that man
[1:01:43] has gathered praise the lord
[1:01:45] we can say amen to god's word
[1:01:49] praise lord
[1:01:50] we can say amen to god's word because
[1:01:53] god has taken people from from from ugly
[1:01:57] past and people you know uh
[1:01:59] uh uh even think about the apostle paul
[1:02:02] he had a blood on his hands
[1:02:05] he has stephen blood on his hands
[1:02:08] because he had their cults and he gave
[1:02:11] the order for stephen to be stoned to
[1:02:13] death
[1:02:16] but yeah he's one of the greatest man in
[1:02:18] the scripture
[1:02:21] the man that was entrusted
[1:02:23] the mysteries unto the gentiles
[1:02:29] praise the lord
[1:02:31] god turned his life around
[1:02:34] or i would like to talk about paul one
[1:02:36] of these days there are a lot of things
[1:02:38] i've been i've been i've been looking at
[1:02:40] in the scripture and being being
[1:02:41] studying about oh my goodness what a
[1:02:44] life that he had
[1:02:47] praise the lord
[1:02:49] amen so you see where we're going we are
[1:02:51] going with this stuff because just like
[1:02:54] i said if you know
[1:02:55] if we put our hearts in it not just to
[1:02:58] come and have a good service and
[1:03:00] not to be a good speaker and you being a
[1:03:03] good listener and say oh i enjoy the
[1:03:05] service tonight but if we grab what the
[1:03:07] holy ghost want to do
[1:03:10] and bring and and to bring us you know
[1:03:13] into a life of dedication
[1:03:17] i'm telling you we can have a pentecost
[1:03:19] here
[1:03:20] amen we can have a pentecost i mean god
[1:03:23] can come in in in
[1:03:25] in an amazing way and just and just pour
[1:03:28] his spirit in our lives you know and
[1:03:31] just raise us above the things that we
[1:03:33] are struggling with all the mind battles
[1:03:36] and the bad feelings and and all the
[1:03:38] negative things that is going on god can
[1:03:40] raise us above it because it's a promise
[1:03:43] he says when the enemy come as a floor
[1:03:45] the spirit of the lord will raise up a
[1:03:48] standard and that's tender
[1:03:51] is for god's people
[1:03:54] praise the lord
[1:03:56] he even he either raise you up
[1:04:00] on the standard or he makes you the
[1:04:02] standard
[1:04:03] he raised you up to be the standard
[1:04:06] praise the lord
[1:04:07] so as we as we look at this subject of
[1:04:11] possessing our vessel
[1:04:13] there's a place i want to go tonight
[1:04:16] there's a place i want to go tonight now
[1:04:18] remember now we're talking about rewards
[1:04:21] we're talking about crowns and and we're
[1:04:23] talking about possessions inheritance
[1:04:26] and all of that
[1:04:27] praise the lord
[1:04:29] amen
[1:04:31] i want to go somewhere tonight
[1:04:34] with this you know when when we were we
[1:04:36] were
[1:04:38] sunday we we took a uh
[1:04:42] a quote from the sixth seal that we were
[1:04:44] reading talking about brandon reward
[1:04:47] the prophet of god reward
[1:04:50] there was there was something there was
[1:04:52] a word that stood out to me as there's a
[1:04:54] phrase that brother branham said
[1:04:56] he used the word
[1:04:58] they're recalling angel
[1:05:01] it caught my attention
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:06] caught my attention
[1:05:08] and then uh
[1:05:10] i thought i said well okay
[1:05:13] uh uh i'll go i will read a little bit
[1:05:16] and see uh
[1:05:17] uh
[1:05:18] you know what what we can be able to
[1:05:20] pick up from there so tonight i want to
[1:05:24] i want to talk about uh
[1:05:26] this possessing our vessel which have to
[1:05:29] do with our body
[1:05:31] now
[1:05:32] in in the book of james
[1:05:35] james brought it in a very beautiful way
[1:05:39] you know and the way he brought it is
[1:05:42] that a man
[1:05:44] that can control his tongue
[1:05:47] is able to bring his entire body
[1:05:54] praise the lord
[1:05:55] amen
[1:05:58] can bring his entire body
[1:06:00] on a suggestion
[1:06:02] so you see possessing
[1:06:05] you know our vessel
[1:06:07] to identification
[1:06:09] i want for us to start with the least
[1:06:11] element
[1:06:14] which is the tongue
[1:06:19] praise the lord
[1:06:22] are we together
[1:06:24] i want for us to start with the least
[1:06:26] element
[1:06:27] which is the
[1:06:30] tongue are we together tonight
[1:06:34] now i remember that i said this will be
[1:06:36] a a bible study don't turn it into a
[1:06:38] preaching service
[1:06:42] because if you turn it into a preaching
[1:06:44] service i won't know how to stop
[1:06:48] are we together
[1:06:50] praise the lord
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:55] now let's let's look over in the book of
[1:06:58] matthew
[1:07:01] let's look over in the book of matthew
[1:07:15] i won't hold you alone tonight
[1:07:18] i pray not to
[1:07:20] unless you allow me to
[1:07:25] but i thought it was it would be good
[1:07:27] for me to allow you to see where i'm
[1:07:30] going
[1:07:31] praise the lord
[1:07:32] amen
[1:07:34] because i'm i'm telling you this is not
[1:07:36] just uh
[1:07:38] you know the pleasure of taking the
[1:07:40] topic to come and speak to you there is
[1:07:42] something that i have on my heart as you
[1:07:45] know uh
[1:07:46] uh believing that the lord will will
[1:07:49] will be able to
[1:07:50] to do you so you know we we are using
[1:07:53] january to sow a sea
[1:07:57] for this year because we i don't know
[1:07:58] what this year holds
[1:08:00] you know i don't know what is going to
[1:08:01] come again you know and uh they might
[1:08:04] shut the churches down and and and all
[1:08:07] of that and you know and we have to stay
[1:08:09] home and you know and everything
[1:08:11] uh
[1:08:13] you know i was telling a family last
[1:08:15] night i had something on my on my notes
[1:08:18] uh i never noticed them but it was part
[1:08:20] of my study you know
[1:08:23] uh uh
[1:08:24] for on on sunday and what what actually
[1:08:28] it is is the other i was i was thinking
[1:08:31] about
[1:08:32] you know uh uh
[1:08:34] the scripture paul speaks there you know
[1:08:37] you know to the corinthians and he's
[1:08:39] telling them you know uh you know
[1:08:41] encouraging them and correcting them
[1:08:44] and he and he made this statement he
[1:08:46] says
[1:08:47] you know
[1:08:49] a young man or a young woman that is not
[1:08:52] married they have they having more time
[1:08:55] for the lord
[1:08:58] than the young then the young woman and
[1:09:00] all the young men that is married now it
[1:09:03] does not means that when a young person
[1:09:05] is now married or you know young or
[1:09:07] older person is not married they are
[1:09:09] more spiritual
[1:09:10] he's just talking about the time you
[1:09:12] have on your hands
[1:09:15] so i was going to drive into that a
[1:09:17] little bit on on sunday i don't know how
[1:09:19] he slipped away from me but uh uh the
[1:09:22] the talk there is that
[1:09:25] uh you have the time now to make
[1:09:27] yourself a better son of god
[1:09:30] you have the time to make yourself a
[1:09:33] better daughter of god
[1:09:35] praise the lord you know it's always
[1:09:37] this thing where people you know uh like
[1:09:40] to put things up for the future i mean
[1:09:42] you know maybe if i get married i would
[1:09:44] get serious you know if i'm settled down
[1:09:46] i'll be serious if you can do it now you
[1:09:48] will never do it
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:53] you will never do it
[1:09:57] praise the lord
[1:09:59] you will never do it
[1:10:00] and now uh uh uh you know uh uh the
[1:10:04] thought also goes in a sense that it's
[1:10:07] not that the the one that is married uh
[1:10:10] you know uh uh uh don't have time for
[1:10:14] the lord but here is here is it yes here
[1:10:17] is the the the mystery that is under the
[1:10:19] marriage covenant man god
[1:10:22] is going to now now you you you have
[1:10:25] moved up to a level where god is is not
[1:10:28] going to deal with you
[1:10:30] not only through your life
[1:10:34] but through the life of your husband
[1:10:37] through the life of your children
[1:10:40] praise the lord
[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:43] he's going to deal with you and now you
[1:10:45] i mean you have to you have to take care
[1:10:47] of your husband or take care of your
[1:10:48] wife you have to take care of your
[1:10:49] children you have to work you know you
[1:10:51] get all of these responsibilities and
[1:10:54] and and and but god is still dealing
[1:10:56] with you
[1:11:01] praise the lord
[1:11:05] so the the the concept of what i had on
[1:11:07] my mind you know it was it was to be
[1:11:10] able to you know uh uh encourage the
[1:11:13] young people you know uh i mean uh
[1:11:16] uh
[1:11:17] god is the one that uh uh separated the
[1:11:20] feminine you know nature from the from
[1:11:23] the masculine nature and and make man
[1:11:26] and make woman
[1:11:28] praise the lord
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:30] and uh
[1:11:32] and he knows the desire of
[1:11:35] of of every one of your hearts
[1:11:38] so what what you must be looking for now
[1:11:41] be looking be sick in the lord
[1:11:45] praise the lord
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:48] be seeking the lord i mean you know if
[1:11:50] you just sit down there and worry all
[1:11:53] the time is passing i'm now marrying and
[1:11:55] and i mean if they give you the the
[1:11:57] marriage and the house and everything
[1:11:59] what are you going to do
[1:12:00] is that going to be the end of your life
[1:12:05] you see where i'm going with the thought
[1:12:08] you know it's it's not that it's a bad
[1:12:10] thing
[1:12:11] you know but paul is saying that why now
[1:12:17] get that thing get that you know get
[1:12:19] that cornerstone down get that solid
[1:12:21] foundation get a stand with god
[1:12:27] that tomorrow when you when you have a
[1:12:29] family and there is trials and and there
[1:12:31] is trouble you know
[1:12:33] it's not going to sweep you up
[1:12:36] because you have a solid foundation with
[1:12:39] the lord
[1:12:41] you have a relationship with him
[1:12:46] it's all in the thought of possessing
[1:12:50] your vessel
[1:12:52] praise the lord
[1:12:53] you don't allow people actions to
[1:12:56] control your
[1:13:02] vessel praise the lord
[1:13:05] you know so all of that all of that
[1:13:08] okay so i think uh
[1:13:11] i forgot about that but i redeemed
[1:13:13] myself tonight
[1:13:16] so let's take let's take this uh matthew
[1:13:19] chapter 12 and see where we want to go
[1:13:21] to tonight by the grace of god
[1:13:23] praise the lord
[1:13:37] now you have to remember
[1:13:40] matthew chapter 12 in my two record
[1:13:43] was a very very important
[1:13:48] junction in jesus ministry
[1:13:52] you have to remember that now
[1:13:54] if you if you have said it before and
[1:13:57] you have to remember
[1:13:59] it's a very major junction
[1:14:03] in jesus ministry
[1:14:05] and what this junction is
[1:14:08] this is the place where jesus
[1:14:12] felt
[1:14:13] the rejection
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:18] this is where he felt the rejection
[1:14:24] this is where they call him belsible
[1:14:28] they call him son of the devil
[1:14:33] are we together
[1:14:34] so
[1:14:36] in response to that
[1:14:38] in response to the rejection and the the
[1:14:42] the the insult of the people
[1:14:45] jesus
[1:14:47] took a turn in his ministry
[1:14:50] and it started from right here
[1:14:53] from this time
[1:14:55] jesus never spoke to the to the public
[1:14:58] again
[1:14:59] every time he spoke it was in parables
[1:15:07] matthew 13 will start the parables
[1:15:11] every time he spoke
[1:15:13] it was in parables
[1:15:16] now so watch here
[1:15:20] praise the lord
[1:15:27] verse 25 and jesus knew they had taught
[1:15:30] and said unto them
[1:15:34] every kingdom divided against itself
[1:15:37] is brought to desolation in every city
[1:15:39] or house divided against itself shall
[1:15:42] now stand and if satan casts out saturn
[1:15:47] he is divided against himself how shall
[1:15:50] then his kingdom stand
[1:15:52] and if by bestiable
[1:15:57] if
[1:15:58] and if i by bestiable cast out devils
[1:16:02] by whom do your children cast him out
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:06] therefore they
[1:16:08] they shall
[1:16:09] be your judge you you you can see how
[1:16:13] you know how
[1:16:14] just just watch the language the way
[1:16:16] that he's even responding to them
[1:16:19] the sense of rejection a man that did
[1:16:22] nothing but healed their sick
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:26] fell the the ones that were hungry
[1:16:34] but if i
[1:16:35] cast out devil by the spirit of god
[1:16:38] he says then the kingdom of god is come
[1:16:41] unto you or as how can
[1:16:44] one enter in a strong man house you know
[1:16:46] when he goes about
[1:16:48] and he he talks he talked about all of
[1:16:51] that
[1:16:52] verse 31
[1:16:54] he said wherefore i say unto you all
[1:16:56] manner of sin and blaspheming shall be
[1:16:59] forgiven
[1:17:00] unto men but the blaspheming against the
[1:17:04] holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto
[1:17:07] men
[1:17:08] and whosoever speaketh a word against
[1:17:12] the son of man
[1:17:13] it shall be forgiving him but whosoever
[1:17:16] speaketh against the holy ghost it shall
[1:17:19] not be forgiving him
[1:17:21] neither in this world
[1:17:24] neither in the world to come
[1:17:27] praise the lord
[1:17:31] are we together
[1:17:33] now so jesus year he see he's he's he's
[1:17:36] kind of for bringing uh a strong
[1:17:39] judgment on uh
[1:17:42] people speaking against the things of
[1:17:45] god
[1:17:46] amen
[1:17:48] people you know speaking against the
[1:17:50] things of god or uh because you have to
[1:17:52] realize that uh uh
[1:17:55] uh this is a mystical body
[1:17:58] there is very little that we know of
[1:18:00] what is happening
[1:18:02] even as we are in church tonight
[1:18:04] there is very very little we know
[1:18:07] of how the spirit convinced men of sin
[1:18:11] of how god deliver his children from
[1:18:13] habit
[1:18:15] how he claims our lives
[1:18:17] there is very little we know about it
[1:18:30] and whosoever speak at a word
[1:18:34] okay let's let's go a little bit neither
[1:18:38] either make a tree good or his fruit
[1:18:40] good or else make the tree corrupt and
[1:18:42] his full corrupt for every tree is known
[1:18:45] by this fruit all generation
[1:18:47] of vipers how can ye
[1:18:50] being evil speak good things
[1:18:53] for out of the abundance of the heart
[1:18:55] the moth speaketh
[1:19:00] a good man out of out of the good
[1:19:02] treasure of his heart bringing forth
[1:19:04] good tidings and an evil man out of the
[1:19:07] evil
[1:19:08] treasure bringeth for evil things
[1:19:11] but i say unto you
[1:19:13] that every other word
[1:19:17] that men shall speak
[1:19:20] they shall give account
[1:19:24] thereof
[1:19:26] in the day
[1:19:27] of judgment
[1:19:29] so in one sense god is going to reward
[1:19:32] us for every word
[1:19:38] that we speak
[1:19:41] so you see how it's important
[1:19:44] for us to be able to bring this body on
[1:19:47] a suggestion
[1:19:48] we have to deal with this little guy
[1:19:52] called the tonga
[1:20:05] for by the words
[1:20:08] for for by thou words thou shalt be
[1:20:11] justified
[1:20:13] and by thy words there shall be
[1:20:15] condemned
[1:20:16] now you can see how god almighty god
[1:20:21] the god that is rich in mercy you see he
[1:20:25] he never he never leave us without
[1:20:28] consolation
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:31] he always have a way to comfort his
[1:20:33] people
[1:20:34] and god will do things through the ages
[1:20:38] to be able to help his children
[1:20:42] praise the lord
[1:20:44] now let me let me let me let me just
[1:20:45] talk a little bit here on uh on our dear
[1:20:48] sister uh uh head right and and hope in
[1:20:51] her songs which of course we we all know
[1:20:53] the story but think about it
[1:20:56] she was a widow
[1:20:58] and she had to bring us those two boys
[1:21:02] you mean
[1:21:04] trying to do the best that she can and
[1:21:06] jerry said that i mean they're they are
[1:21:09] teenagers and you know and and they're
[1:21:11] having peer pressure and and everything
[1:21:14] following you know uh their friends and
[1:21:17] and all of that and and you ever said
[1:21:19] her heart is crying out
[1:21:22] you can just think about uh
[1:21:24] the sons of zebedee their mother coming
[1:21:27] to jesus and even asking jesus oh lord
[1:21:30] let my two sons when you come in your
[1:21:32] kingdom
[1:21:33] said one on your right and another one
[1:21:35] on that's that's a mother's heart
[1:21:39] that goes for her for her babies
[1:21:42] and you can just think that and brother
[1:21:45] branham giving that challenge and saying
[1:21:47] ask whatever you will for her to for you
[1:21:51] know uh uh clear out everything from her
[1:21:55] mind whatever need that she need her
[1:21:57] sister sick in the we cheered and bound
[1:22:00] there and then all the needs for her to
[1:22:03] be able to just block everything and ask
[1:22:06] for the salvation of her boys it tells
[1:22:08] you how much she had them on her heart
[1:22:16] praise the lord
[1:22:24] but you see it never just came
[1:22:26] by
[1:22:31] just asking for the salvation of her
[1:22:33] voice
[1:22:34] it came by what she said from her mouth
[1:22:41] praise the lord
[1:22:43] which of course we know
[1:22:45] the word is a taught express
[1:22:50] brethren i'm talking
[1:22:52] testifying
[1:22:54] about speaking those scores into
[1:22:56] existence
[1:22:57] she was not there
[1:22:59] praise the lord
[1:23:01] amen
[1:23:06] she didn't ask for uh uh
[1:23:09] a physical proof
[1:23:12] now look at the scene here let me let me
[1:23:14] show you the scene right here
[1:23:16] right in that conversation
[1:23:19] warner brother branham deacon's brother
[1:23:21] tony
[1:23:24] he said brother branham he says if god
[1:23:27] if god if god show it to you you know it
[1:23:30] have to be there
[1:23:32] and brother branham says i pick it up he
[1:23:34] said brother tony are you doubting me
[1:23:41] he says i pick it up
[1:23:44] since i knew our brother was an earnest
[1:23:46] brother but you you know the the prophet
[1:23:49] of god who just could just speak that
[1:23:51] little sense of doubt
[1:23:58] but years to watch woman here
[1:24:02] yes so we watch woman no position in the
[1:24:05] church and i mean she's one of the least
[1:24:07] and a single mother struggling with her
[1:24:09] boys
[1:24:14] and she just said brother branham that's
[1:24:16] nothing but the truth
[1:24:18] now the thing about it there is that she
[1:24:20] was it was it was not like brother
[1:24:22] branham was just talking to her alone
[1:24:24] there were a lot of people there
[1:24:26] and again i don't believe that she was
[1:24:29] the only one
[1:24:32] that knew that that was the truth there
[1:24:34] were a lot of people that have
[1:24:35] experienced the gift of god healing and
[1:24:38] different things they have witnessed in
[1:24:40] brother branham life to know that what
[1:24:42] he was saying it was the truth
[1:24:49] but why did god pick her
[1:24:51] among the many
[1:24:55] praise the lord
[1:25:05] are we together tonight
[1:25:11] every other word
[1:25:13] that a man speak
[1:25:18] every other word you think about it
[1:25:20] young people
[1:25:22] if signs
[1:25:24] signs
[1:25:26] the invention of men
[1:25:29] can be able
[1:25:30] to
[1:25:31] create
[1:25:32] you know uh uh equipment
[1:25:35] by which they can be able to pick up a
[1:25:38] video if there was an accident on this
[1:25:40] road they can be able to do whatever
[1:25:42] whatever by the satellite or by the
[1:25:45] camera on the street they can be able to
[1:25:47] to zoom that video down
[1:25:51] to be able to see what actually happened
[1:25:57] then you think about the god
[1:26:01] that make man
[1:26:09] praise the lord
[1:26:17] now so it's it's not just
[1:26:19] you know if if if men will be rewarded
[1:26:24] for other words
[1:26:25] that they speak
[1:26:28] i also want to encourage you
[1:26:32] that we will be rewarded
[1:26:35] if we seize in our words with grace
[1:26:41] because the apostle paul said we must
[1:26:43] seize in our conversation
[1:26:45] with grace
[1:26:49] praise the lord
[1:26:51] god rewarded
[1:26:53] our sister in this life
[1:26:56] with the salvation
[1:26:58] of her boys
[1:27:00] with the salvation of her boys now
[1:27:04] people have their their you know their
[1:27:08] their their thought and their
[1:27:09] explanation what happened to haiti rise
[1:27:11] on and you know all all of these
[1:27:13] information sessions i want to go on
[1:27:15] youtube and
[1:27:17] google and sasha or haiti raw boy what
[1:27:19] happened to them did they say in the
[1:27:20] faith before they died and you know and
[1:27:22] then all of this they don't mean nothing
[1:27:25] to almighty god
[1:27:32] praise the lord
[1:27:35] because salvation
[1:27:37] is a free
[1:27:38] gift
[1:27:42] it's a free
[1:27:44] gift
[1:27:48] it meant nothing to god
[1:27:50] to give salvation to the thief on the
[1:27:52] cross
[1:27:56] and says let me let me see everything
[1:27:58] that you have done in your life
[1:28:02] oh i'm not going to give it to you until
[1:28:04] your last birth
[1:28:06] even though you're saying this i will
[1:28:08] wait until because i don't know if you
[1:28:10] are going to change your mind
[1:28:18] praise the lord
[1:28:21] so you see
[1:28:22] we will get to to the james chapter
[1:28:24] there maybe not tonight or another time
[1:28:27] you know you you will see that
[1:28:30] how
[1:28:32] very important it is
[1:28:36] brother brahm talks about
[1:28:38] elisha the bible speaks about it but a
[1:28:41] prophet of god pick it up and talks
[1:28:43] about elisha
[1:28:46] and
[1:28:48] you know
[1:28:49] calling the bed
[1:28:52] on those children
[1:28:56] because of them
[1:28:58] insulting him or teasing him
[1:29:00] and all of that
[1:29:04] and brother branham said
[1:29:10] that is because
[1:29:14] they heard their parents
[1:29:17] talking you know that cranky prophet
[1:29:20] who know that where he came from brought
[1:29:22] her in and all of that
[1:29:24] now so you you realize
[1:29:27] that because of the things that they
[1:29:29] said
[1:29:31] god rewarded them
[1:29:33] that way
[1:29:39] yes a woman because of the thing that
[1:29:41] she said
[1:29:44] god gave her
[1:29:46] the salvation of her children
[1:29:53] praise the lord
[1:29:59] think about solomon
[1:30:03] being young
[1:30:07] and david getting old
[1:30:15] the throne is now threatened
[1:30:20] even before
[1:30:22] uh solomon came on the scene you know
[1:30:24] you have to remember it was the the
[1:30:27] prophet mitten
[1:30:28] that instructed david that solomon is
[1:30:31] the one that inherited the throne
[1:30:35] but david loved his son absalom
[1:30:38] he was one of david's favorite
[1:30:43] the bible say he was a handsome man
[1:30:46] with a lot of afro on his head
[1:30:49] praise the lord
[1:30:50] amen
[1:30:52] he didn't find the bible so his head
[1:30:54] caught him in the tree his own
[1:30:56] hair hang him
[1:30:59] but
[1:30:59] solomon being young
[1:31:02] and you think about it
[1:31:04] the history of his birth
[1:31:10] what everybody knows
[1:31:18] and the throne being threatened and and
[1:31:21] and the prophet will now install him to
[1:31:23] be a king

[1:31:41] but the things that he said
[1:31:44] the things that came out of his mouth

[1:32:02] the things that we say
[1:32:07] oh i i just made a mistake i don't even
[1:32:09] know how i said it
[1:32:12] no
[1:32:13] it's generated from our thoughts
[1:32:24] just a young boy
[1:32:27] saying oh god
[1:32:29] oh god
[1:32:35] if young people would take that kind of
[1:32:37] a reference
[1:32:39] to the things of god
[1:32:42] and even reference
[1:32:44] to their own life

[1:34:49] his vessel possess his body
[1:34:51] and put himself to a place where
[1:34:54] the people respected him because god
