[0:00] understanding what time of day is it
[0:02] what about the scripture for this day
[0:06] the conditions of the church
[0:08] are the conditions of the church today
[0:10] in the world politics our world system
[0:13] is just as rot as it can be
[0:16] I'm not a politician I'm a Christian but
[0:18] I got no business taught by politics but
[0:20] I just want to say they're rotten on
[0:22] both sides
[0:23] I voted once that was for Christ I got
[0:26] to win
[0:28] the devil booted against me Christ voted
[0:30] for me depends on which way I cast my
[0:32] vote I'm glad I cast it on him let the
[0:35] world see what they want to I still
[0:38] believe that he's the same yesterday the
[0:40] day and forever
[0:42] he'll prove it
[0:44] certainly will
[0:46] certainly the increase in crime juvenile
[0:49] delinquency look at our nation what's
[0:51] the power of the earth our great
[0:53] democracy was born back then and the
[0:56] Declaration of Independence and
[0:58] decoration made a bit of society we had
[1:00] a democracy that our great forefathers
[1:02] are the things that they've done we had
[1:04] a great nation but she is an old rotten
[1:07] egg from me and shaking and giving away
[1:09] you're trying to tax people money to
[1:12] stand around to buy friendship with
[1:14] their enemies they're throwing it back
[1:16] in her face
[1:17] One World War II world wars still moving
[1:19] on to the third one certainly politics
[1:22] is rotten corrupted rotten to the bottom
[1:24] just just like what Matthew 24 said it
[1:27] would be they should be against Nation
[1:29] Kingdom against Kingdom
[1:31] all these things would take place let's
[1:33] consider this now all right notice
[1:36] another
[1:36] the increase in scientific research now
[1:40] at one time Mr my grandfather went to
[1:42] see my grandmother in an ox cart
[1:45] now
[1:46] it's a jet
[1:48] or even a orbit into the Earth in the
[1:52] outer space
[1:54] great who said this Daniel 12 4 said
[1:58] knowledge shall increase in the last
[2:00] days
[2:00] we see the hour We're living notice uh
[2:04] the the conditions of the world the
[2:06] condition of Science and notice again
[2:08] today in our educational system
[2:11] I don't try to now this I've got the
[2:14] newspaper clippings
[2:15] teaching sex in our church in our
[2:19] schools of young students that have
[2:23] one others see if they can mate in the
[2:25] world
[2:27] yes sir how about our priesthood tonight
[2:30] I got a piece out of paper over in Los
[2:32] Angeles California over a bunch of
[2:35] clergymen Baptist Baptist Presbyterians
[2:37] ministers brought a bonus to homosexuals
[2:40] and in practice homosexual
[2:43] Sanders trying to win them to God when
[2:45] that's why the curses of the hour a
[2:48] sodomite and the law even arrested him
[2:51] that where we at our whole system is
[2:54] rottened up and unders I've seen the
[2:56] increase of homosexual across the United
[2:58] States has increased 20 or 30 percent
[3:00] were last year
[3:01] think of that man living with man just
[3:05] exactly like they did in Sodom
[3:07] increase in crime juvenile delinquency
[3:10] what art are we living this day this
[3:13] word of Prophecy is fulfilled
[3:17] the religious world the church itself
[3:19] the church the call-out church that we
[3:22] call to call our church the last Church
[3:25] AIDS the Pentecostal Church where is it
[3:28] it's in laosiah as the scripture said
[3:33] they they let down the bars their women
[3:36] are half just their manner it's a
[3:39] horrible thing some of them married
[3:40] three or four times on Deacon boards and
[3:42] everything else they fled down and
[3:44] brought in corruption because they set a
[3:47] castles
[3:48] and took the place with the world and
[3:51] today they got better feelings they ever
[3:53] had some place one of them's building a
[3:56] 50 million dollar Auditorium
[3:59] 50 million dollar Pentecostals it used
[4:01] to be down on the corner 25 years ago
[4:03] beating a tambourine
[4:06] said we because the scripture said in
[4:08] Revelation 3 that you are rich said I'm
[4:12] rich I said as a queen I have needed
[4:14] nothing and Norse thou not that dark
[4:16] wretched miserable poor naked minds and
[4:20] the Lord
[4:22] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[4:25] your eyes
[4:26] amen
[4:28] amen he's so be it
[4:30] I'm not Amen in myself but I mean I
[4:33] believe it's the truth this day this
[4:34] scripture is fulfilled
[4:37] the Pentecostal church is in a lady of
[4:39] sea condition or they still jump and
[4:42] holler and carry on When the Music's
[4:43] beaten when the music stops beating or
[4:46] the beatnik music someone playing call
[4:48] it Christianity and whenever that stops
[4:51] all the Glory's gone
[4:53] this
[4:55] is it's a real praise of God there isn't
[4:57] enough whistles and enough the power in
[4:59] the world to stop it when it really
[5:02] comes from God it don't take music to be
[5:04] beat up it takes a spirit of God to come
[5:06] down
[5:07] that is long forgotten the cause of
[5:10] class the gift of the Holy Ghost initial
[5:12] evidence of speaking in tongues and I
[5:14] heard devils and witches speak in
[5:15] tongues
[5:17] the Holy Ghost is a word of God in you
[5:19] that identifies Itself by accepting that
[5:21] word
[5:22] kind of that it can't be the Holy Ghost
[5:24] if it says it's the Holy Spirit denies
[5:26] one word that Bible it cannot be the
[5:28] Holy Spirit
[5:30] that's the evidence whether you believe
[5:31] or not notice another great sign the
[5:35] Jews are in their Homeland their own
[5:37] Nation their own money
[5:39] a member of the United Nations they got
[5:42] their own armies they got everything
[5:44] they're in their Homeland which Jesus
[5:46] said learn a parable of the fig tree
[5:48] there they are right back in their
[5:50] Nation
[5:51] this day this scripture is fulfilled the
[5:54] Jews in their Homeland this day this
[5:56] scriptures fulfilled the lady I see a
[5:58] church age this day this scripture
[6:00] Matthew 24 is fulfilled the world is in
[6:02] corruption the whole thing nations

[6:09] great whirlwinds coming down shaking the
[6:12] Nations and so forth great disasters

[6:16] fulfilled now
[6:18] we found out the condition of the world
[6:20] we see where the church novel the normal

[6:26] they are we see where the nations are
[6:28] and we see that this day these promises
[6:32] is fulfilled
[6:34] now but in this okay there is to come a
[6:38] super raw Seed of Abraham
[6:40] that's exactly you want to be with the

[6:54] the Royal seat of the royal faith of

[12:31] present tonight and I guess eight or ten
[12:34] of a man of 15 that was there at that
[12:37] time when it took place the next morning
[12:38] where the Lord came down in a of
[12:40] wind and ripped the mountain out around
[12:42] us and cut the tops of the trees and
[12:44] made three flags and said Johnson but
[12:47] it's headed towards the West Coast amen
[12:49] two days after that Alaska almost sunk
[12:52] beneath the Earth
[12:53] I had since then up and down the coast
[12:56] of belches of God's judgment against
[12:59] that spiritual screen
[13:01] there is a iron curtain there is a
[13:05] bamboo curtain there is a sand curtain
[13:07] civilizations travel with the Sun so has
[13:10] the gospel they've come from the East
[13:12] and went West like the sun goes and now
[13:15] it's on the west coast it can't go no
[13:17] further
[13:18] if it goes further it'll be back East
[13:20] again the prophet said there will come a
[13:22] day there cannot be cold night or days a
[13:25] Discord a lot of rain has fallen just
[13:28] enough how to know how to join a church
[13:30] or what's your name on a book but it's

[13:36] this day this scripture is fulfilled the
[13:41] same
[13:41] [Applause]
[13:44] the same s-u-n that rises in the East is
[13:48] the same s-u-n that sets in the west and
[13:52] the same s-o-n of God that come in the
[13:55] East and Vindicated himself as God
[13:58] God manifested in the flesh is the same
[14:01] so in a thought in the Western
[14:03] Hemisphere here that's identifying
[14:05] itself among the church tonight the same
[14:07] yesterday that Israel

[14:10] evening eyes as the sun has come this
[14:14] day this scripture is fulfilled before
[14:16] us
[14:17] what are we at in this abrahamic age

[14:22] standing the great hour that we're
[14:23] living all the Visions has been

[14:58] Pyramid open and when it did said
[15:00] granite rock with no writing on it and
[15:02] you told us to look in upon this
[15:05] and you always we all started looking so
[15:07] I turned my head and I noticed you going
[15:10] towards the West just as hard as you
[15:12] could towards just setting up a sun how
[15:14] many remembers it
[15:15] now I stood down a little bit till the
[15:17] Holy Spirit revealed I said the entire
[15:19] Bible as much has been revealed to man
[15:21] through justification sanctification
[15:23] baptism the Holy Ghost the baptism in
[15:25] Jesus name and all these things has been
[15:27] revealed but various secrets that's hid
[15:30] inside because the Bible seal with Seven
[15:32] Seals I must go there to find it that
[15:36] morning when there were seven angels
[15:37] come down and blasted the Earth and
[15:39] rocks through every way seven angels
[15:41] stood there and said return back to

[15:45] for the seventh seal to the seven
[15:47] Mysteries we all be opened here we are
[15:50] today we're understanding serpency in a
[15:52] few days of God willing to understand
[15:54] the correctness of marriage and divorce
[15:55] and all these things that God's open to
[15:57] ever seal the message sets the
[15:59] foundation of the world
[16:00] John the presence of his presence
[16:03] that is true this day the Scripture A
[16:07] Life Magazine packed an article of it
[16:09] Mystic Circle of Life goes up in the air
[16:11] about Tucson and Phoenix in the same way
[16:14] that I told you nearly a year before it
[16:16] happened
[16:17] how to be in a like a triangle the
[16:19] picture hangs in the church down there
[16:21] you took that magazine has it there it
[16:24] was just exactly it said it's 27 miles
[16:25] high and 30 miles across they don't
[16:28] understand yet what happened it appeared
[16:30] mysteriously and went away mysteriously
[16:32] and brother Fred Savin brother Gene
[16:35] Norman asked and there are three as a
[16:36] witness I get up all the top of the
[16:38] mouth Peter James and John they give
[16:40] Witnesses
[16:43] there it is hanging in the sky so far
[16:46] there's no humidity no moisture nothing
[16:48] to make them a fog how could it come
[16:51] there was the angels of God returning
[16:53] back add to their message this day that
[16:56] prophecy has been fulfilled and on this
[16:59] this day this scripture has been
[17:02] fulfilled watch
[17:04] Seven Seals has been opened the world
[17:06] wins to the West Coast
[17:09] like they did backyard
[17:12] now our attention a little closer to our
[17:15] day
[17:16] what does the scripture say about today
[17:19] and about the time we live in Jesus
[17:23] speaking won't have time to take them
[17:25] all but I want to take this one
[17:27] before we close
[17:29] Jesus said in Saint Luke the 17th
[17:32] chapter the 31st Jesus Christ the word
[17:35] himself you believe that
[17:38] Jesus Christ the word himself made flesh
[17:41] spoke and said what the word would be in
[17:44] the end time what would be the sign of
[17:47] the end of the world he told him they
[17:49] should arise against Nation but he said
[17:51] as it was in the days of Sodom
[17:54] so shall it be in the day when the son
[17:58] of man is being revealed
[18:00] now when Jesus came to the Earth he came
[18:02] in the name of Three Sons
[18:04] son of man which is a prophet Son of God
[18:08] and Son of David now he literature on
[18:11] Earth he never did say he was the son of
[18:13] God he said I'm the son of man Jehovah
[18:16] himself called Ezekiel and the prophets
[18:18] son of man because he had to come to
[18:20] fulfill scripture as a prophet
[18:24] Moses said the larger God shall raise up
[18:27] a prophet likened into me that's the
[18:29] reason he could not be the Son of God
[18:31] there because he was a son of man he the
[18:34] word came to the prophets and he was the
[18:37] word in his fullness amen son of man the
[18:40] major prophet not the major prophet but
[18:43] the god prophet
[18:45] fullness of the godhead bodily was in it
[18:47] therefore he was the son of man now for
[18:50] two thousand years he's been known to us
[18:52] as Son of God spirit and in the
[18:55] Millennium he'll be son of David upon
[18:57] the throne we all know that he would
[18:59] believe the scriptures now Jesus said
[19:01] just at the end of this church age that
[19:05] we're living in that the son of man
[19:08] would be revealed again in the same
[19:10] manner it was as it was as Sodom
[19:37] [Music]
[19:41] thank you
[19:45] [Music]
[20:00] [Laughter]
[20:03] thank you
