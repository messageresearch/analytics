let's turn to the Bible Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 Wednesday we we we we we started speaking on something and uh so actually it's not because it is the first Sunday that's what I'm preaching from Genesis chapter one but actually it's because that's what I want to preach on this morning praise the Lord Genesis chapter one once in that we started the little subject the beginning of God and we want to continue in they I Tau this morning if uh if the Lord will will just be gracious to us Genesis chapter 1 let's read uh uh verse one Genesis chapter 1 can we read that verse one together in the beginning God God created the Heaven and the Earth St John chapter 1 in John chapter 1 verse one can we read in John chapter 1 verse one together in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was G let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord we Just Want to Thank You Lord and and uh it's so good to know that Lord father even you said in the beginning and father Lord God to know that even your sacred word Moses will start Lord writing and saying in the beginning and father we will learn from your word that was the beginning of time with everything in time there is a beginning and father there is another year that is beginning in time 2024 it have never been Lord and father we want to begin it with you so Lord we want to pray this morning that you would just come now take your word bless it to our hearts now in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat actually this morning I want to speak on in the beginning God in the beginning God praise the lord it's amazing that uh uh uh Moses will give us this record that he will he will start uh recording uh the the creation and he will begin this way in the beginning God praise the Lord it is uh it is uh it's amazing that uh uh at first I was listening to I know I know that kind of a Sidetrack here listening to what we play for the our other Sunday school this morning the beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation and uh as as we were playing there this this quote struck my mind and I I was following there from from the office and when he saw the vision the head of God and the breast year of savor the ti of brides the feet of iron notice each kyom got a little harder there that's that's uh the dream that K nebuch kinzer had that Daniel was interpreting and and that's the thing that caught my attention each kingom got a little harder Savor is more harder than God Bri is more harder than saver and iron is more harder than brass each kiddom got a little h k nebukadnezar Kum was the head of God he interpret a diner interpreted told him just exactly how those kingom will succeed uh each other onto the end and no this from gold is the sface gold is the sface saor is Nest then bra BR brass is Nest then iron is Nest hather hather CER farther away so as the kingdom will come from from Nebuchadnezzar which of course right now we are in the in the the the kingdom of iron we are actually in the Roman Kingdom and uh uh uh uh uh we don't we don't seem to realize that but under the Fulfillment of of of that interpretation from Daniel that is the time that we are we are living in so we realized that uh uh when when when uh Nebuchadnezzar had that drein it was all about the Gentile Kingdom and in God's program we are Gentiles we are not Jews praise the Lord amen we are Gentiles I know there there's uh there there's a lot of uh uh uh Christian churches they there that are trying to uh you know uh um uh subscribe them as mic uh Jews and mic Christians and and and all of that uh uh it's it's beautiful you know we we love the Jewish people and uh uh our Bible is full of uh Jewish history but we are not Jews we are Gentiles praise the Lord and and like I said to you before uh uh uh uh some of the things that uh uh uh most of these uh uh Messi IC believing uh uh Christians uh I don't know how to call them whether they are Jews or they are Christians but you know they believe in uh uh uh the the the Jewish mesiah and uh uh what they don't realize is that uh the uh even even the the Jews presently they don't have uh uh a complete worship because they don't have a temple you know they don't have a temple the only thing they have is the Willing War there pie piece of War structure that is left from Solomon's Temple that were to go to say their prayers and right on top of it that's where the Muslim built the the mar and and Daniel spoke about there can you imagine hundreds of years before that M was built Daniel spoke about it and uh uh uh uh uh so I mean all everything that is happening there in the Middle East with Gaza and all of that uh if there is one thing that I believe we we should pay attention to is is that is that place and I think uh the the Orthodox Jews is kind of for putting some pressure pressure on the presentent administration because they want to get their Temple back you know they want to get their Temple back so the Jews does not have a full full worship they cannot make sacrifices ACC calling according to the Lord of Moses they cannot make S sacrifices they don't have a rare halfer you know to make sa sacrifice so without their sacrifices their worship is not complete praise the Lord amen and and out of ignorance many will will will want to identify themselves to that and incomplete worship when you you and myself praise the lord we don't we don't need animal sacrifices we have one that gave his life that's the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord and if we can accept him as our sacrifice we have full worship to God praise the Lord why should I estrip myself to a partial worship ascribe myself to to an incomplete worship when I can come humbling praise the Lord even if I don't come to church I can get right in my KN on on my knees in my bedroom lift my hands to God and have a complete worship because I'm coming through Jesus Christ are we together now I saw I was I was just uh I don't know how I got there but I was just talking about this uh this this uh uh Vision uh uh that that down here interpret and and that's that's what I wanted to just for us to just uh be able to see here a little bit before we get into what we want to talk just to just realize I asked brother Jordi if he can just give us a picture of the image that uh uh that was that was interpreted and uh so that's that's there something like this something like this was Dan Vision that was what he saw so uh uh uh the the the the head of God and uh uh the breast of saor and then uh uh the the belly and tie was of BR that was the Greece kidum and the leg was iron but right down here it was going to be iron mixed with Clay praise the Lord and uh but what Dr my my attention actually was just like I read to you as as as the kingdom moved on it was moving from uh h h a a softer power a softer influence to a more stronger influence praise the Lord amen so as it moves from God to come to iron it started progressing in strength right praise the Lord amen it started progressing in in strength are we together amen amen so thank you brother Jordan so uh uh uh uh as we continue to read let me just read another paragraph here notice then in the midst of all of that Daniel beheld the image until a stone was held out of the mountain that was cut out without hands that's why the Bible says it Rod into the image and broke it and made it like a wheat on the summer tching floor and the wind and the Wind Drive away and the stone grew into a great Mountain that cover all the earth and the seed that was the coming of the Lord which is now at hand so we realize that that stone uh uh was was the coming of the Lord a type of the Millennium you go over to the book of Isaiah it talks about the melum as a great Mountain uh Isaiah spoke about that like there and so we we see there that stone it was healed out of the mountain it struck the image on on the feet and the entire image came down there's there's uh you know there's uh uh uh type of the destruction of the word and uh and then the the stone grew up into a great Mountain that is the kingdom of God now so we realize that we we are in such a time you know where we have uh a kind of a strong influence there that is the thought that was on my mind because it's the spirit of the age it was it's already reflected in God's word you know as these gentle Powers will be taken over they will have a very strong influence on the people and in that same instance the influence of God will decrease from the people the people will go colder and colder farther further away from God all will be left for us is just church tradition we cannot produce the life we cannot back up what we believe back up what we are saying you know with with with life I mean now with with with with our life now so that is something that I want for us to pay attention to praise the Lord and uh uh we we have to pay attention to we we are under uh a kiddom we uh that that is having a very very strong influence on the people and uh with the with the the the the iron and Clay mix we know that is the mix of pagan Pagan Rome came and joined into the church and that's where they brought all these Pagan things that the church has adopted today praise the Lord all these Pagan things so we we have H we have a bunch of uh traditions and manmade traditions in Creed that is is is all mixes up into what is called Christianity Today and there's that is the thing that is killing the the influence of Christ from the church hundreds of years ago God prophesied there back there in the Book of Daniel chapter 2 you can go and read it you know even before our time is here God spoke about that so we can realize that uh uh if there is ever a time where we need to be uh bucker up with our our our Christian Life is is uh you know is is is this time praise the Lord amen yeah because we have spirit that is Waring against us you know uh uh that that it just want us to have a form of religion come to church on Sunday come to church whatever time we can have church in a week and then there is nothing of our life that resemble what is in the scripture may God help us amen as we begin with God praise the Lord get back to Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning God in the beginning God that's why we want we want to speak on this morning in the beginning God it's it's amazing that uh Moses started the sacred word there way he started his uh his uh his witness of what God told him we know that uh in exodor uh God Called Moses to the mountain 40 days and 40 night he he was in the mountain God preserved him and God told him to write those things down so uh uh all of these things that uh uh are written there in the first five books of the Bible uh were written by Moses and he wrote those things on the the instruction of God most especially the beginning of the word so you know that is not just men that formulate these things and say in the beginning uh uh you know God created the Heaven and the Earth well also in the beginning God I thought about this and thought that what a way to be able to start the year then to talk about the beginning in the beginning God praise the Lord amen amen may God be our beginning amen praise the Lord may God be the beginning of our church life home life work life and uh our entire life praise the Lord but you see uh uh the the the the the English Bible didn't did US lot of Justice it didn't do us lot of Justice because we have to realize that the Bible was first translated from Hebrew to Greek and then in the in the midst of uh of uh uh uh translation many things that people will call contradiction in the Bible the Bible don't have no contradiction I can challenge anyone on it the Bible do not have no contradiction most of the things that people will classify as contradiction they are all effects of translation praise the Lord amen they are all effects of translation because when you even look at this very expression in the beginning God you will realize that uh uh uh the word there that was translated was Elohim because if you say God God means an object of worship right amen amen so God could not be God until he has something to worship Him amen so before he had something to worship him he was existing so the actual word there is Elohim the self-existent one that is the actual word the Elohim the self-existing one because when you actually look at this let's look at it together Genesis chapter [Music] 1 I have a place where I know I will I will I I will make you to think the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth God created the Heaven and the Earth verse two says and the Earth was with our form my question is then what did God created in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth praise the Lord amen amen then Moses comes down to verse two and says then the Earth was with our form and it was V and and darkness was upon the face of the deep then what did God created praise the Lord amen but let me let me let's let's let's help ourself this morning let's look at some few places in the Bible let's look at uh uh St John chapter 17 let's look at St John chapter 17 we see our lord Jesus saying some very strange thing that will make us to to reconsider what Moses said St John chapter 17 praise the Lord are we together I always ask that because I don't want to lose you if I lose you I just be talking to myself it's not a fun thing it's a sign of Madness praise the Lord that's in John Chapter 7 let's look here in verse 24 Jesus is praying here and he says something very interesting that I want for us to pay attention to he said father verse 24 father I will that that they also whom thou Hast giv me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the word simple English Foundation of anything is the beginning so Jesus said before the beginning thou loveth me praise the Lord amen so we see Jesus here referring to a time before what Moses recorded Moses recorded in the beginning beginning God Jesus here is referring to a time before the beginning that's not the only scripture so uh I mean the Bible say in the mouth of two or three so let's find two or three Matthew Chapter 13 Matthew Chapter 13 Matthew chapter 13 let's read from verse verse uh 34 this this chapter in the Bible is is very very very important Matthew chapter 12 that was where Jesus IND the the the people you remember they called Jesus Bible in Matthew chapter 12 and and from that time Jesus never spoke to the people openly he spoke to them in parable it changed his ministry why because they rejected the ministry of Jesus Christ by calling him Bible that was in chapter 12 now in Chapter 13 He gave this parable about the sword and uh and and the seed and all of the but then he closed the parable saying this let's look at verse 34 Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 34 all these things Jesus speak unto the multitudes in Parables and without Parable speak he not unto them that they might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets you if you know want to find where this was ever spoken that was in Psalm chapter 78:2 1 and 2 you can find that there now which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in parables I will alter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the word praise the Lord Ephesians chapter 1 there that is very familiar to us Ephesians chapter 1 but there's a place I'm going with this Ephesians chapter 1 that is uh very familiar to us praise the Lord amen now so the Bible year is uh is recording a time uh uh uh speaking of a time that is called the foundation before the foundation of the word and the reason why that is uh uh uh important is that it will help us to understand uh Genesis 1 verse one you know because this book that we call the Bible from the time of creation every time that have ever exist in the universe and the Earth is recorded in this Bible praise the Lord amen amen so you will realize there between verses and between phrases that are said in the Bible it could be 10 years it could be 20 years praise the Lord amen now so in in Ephesians chapter one I said let's read Ephesians chapter 1 that will be verse uh 4 Ephesians chapter 1:4 for some reason my Bible Pages are sticking together let's read from verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heaven a places in Christ as ACC calling as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the word so we realize that God love for us was now when we came to know about it the Bible says there Paul year is saying that he choose us in him before the which mean before the beginning amen hallelujah before Moses were write in the beginning there was a time that exists praise the Lord you see the the uh that's that's that's one of the the the the the weakness of the human mind praise the Lord amen that's one one another weakness of the human mind the human mind does not uh uh you know uh uh uh you you don't have your mind when you start going to school your mind is developed in the womb but what in the womb do you remember can you tell me anything that you remember when you were in the womb you can remember praise the Lord amen oh but ask your mama she will tell you she would say you were the Frisk child when you were in the womb you were kicking all over the place I don't know what about this child the law of chocolate when I had this child I just crave for chocolate and you'll just sit there and you just be looking you can't remember praise the Lord that's the same way you can't remember before the foundation of the word praise the Lord you can't remember that you existed before the foundation of the word amen praise the Lord but the Bible is giving us an account here Jesus is speaking of a Time Apostle Paul spoke about it you go to uh First Peter chapter 1 Peter the Apostle also spoke about the time called the foundation of the word you can take your app on your phone your Bible and just pull out foundation of the word you will see all the scripture that speaks about it and the important thing I want us to to understand is that Foundation is a beginning amen the beginning of anything is called the foundation so there was a period of time there was a period of time that Moses is describing here when he said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period it's a period of time far before the first day the second day the Third dead that does that does not describe the work that was done in a succession of dead in Genesis that was speaking about a time when God dwell by himself just like I said the self-existent god you go over to the book of Hebrew the Bible will tell you that all of his works all of God's Works were finished from the foundation of the word praise the Lord that's the reason why God is not in h God is not scared he's never Nevers I will remind you you cannot surprise God I will also tell you that you cannot disappoint him [Music] am he knows that the end from the beginning praise the Lord I would tell you I don't I don't I I I you know I I I I I I I want to be careful with my words this morning but I will tell you that there is nothing honor the son that you could do to stop being here this morning that's true nothing hon the son you could have done to change being here this morning and you're being here this morning you just figuring it out but God knew there from the foundation of the word are we together amen you see and and when when you when we understand these things then life is no longer a right race when we understand these things we live a life of appreciation praise the Lord to the one that have formed us and the Bible says he has determined our steps he know our down sitting and our Uprising praise the Lord he knows all the different things that we will go through so we are introduced to this time called the foundation of the word we spoke a little bit about that on on Wednesday night but in a different context and uh uh uh so actually God uh uh uh I think this uh this will this will also help us praise the Lord hallelujah amen you love the Lord this morning am I sure you do I believe they are with you praise the Lord I just I just quoted something and uh there uh Hebrew chapter 4 verse3 let's let's look at that one also Hebrews chapter 4:3 for we which have believe do enter into rest as he said for I have sown in my wrath if if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the word praise the Lord amen amen The Works were finished from the foundation so this help us to understand what Moses said God created the Heaven and the Earth in his mind it was a finished work God he had a finished work in his mind praise the Lord amen that's the reason why no man goes to building a house and just that well I mean sometimes we we did that amen we didn't have no plane we just as well I want full bedroom here I'm going to make a full bedroom there is no there is no plan of you know the dimensions of the room no this one is too big let's let's break it down let's push it a little bit but I mean praise the Lord but I mean uh uh uh uh uh uh you know an architect there there there have to be a blueprint so everything that God who made he first T about it so in his mind it was a finished work God created the Heaven and the Earth finished it was a finished work in his mind so there was a space of time there was a gap of time between Genesis chter 1 and Genesis Genesis 1 verse1 and Genesis 1:2 because now God is going to express that finished work that was in his mind he's now going to make it visible whatever was in his mind whatever he thought about the Earth he's now going to make it visible that is the reason why you salvation is not a guess workor praise the Lord you might be playing church but God is not playing games praise the Lord amen hallelujah God is not playing games because his works are finished from the foundation of the word praise the Lord amen so in his mind it was a finished work he he was only coming down to express to be able now whatever was in his mind to make it materialize are we together so that great internal Spirit that's the reason why the Bible says and the spirit of God move upon the Earth he moved upon the Earth and then he said let there be light because in his mind there was light are we together praise the Lord in the beginning God and we also spoke on Wednesday night that was where we we we show that even Elohim had his own beginning praise the Lord amen and if you see what Moses said we compare there with what John also said when he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God praise the lord we we we showed a little bit there the John he never overthought that John actually got that from The Book of Revelation when Jesus was revealing to John the continuation of the church the the the the continuation of the work of Jesus the continuation of the revelation of Jesus there in Revelation chap 3 verse4 when Jesus introduced himself to the to the the Lisha Church age he introduced him himself as the beginning of the creation of God praise the Lord now that was where John got that understanding because John never wrote his book until he came back from the island of pmos Praise the Lord amen when he came back from the island of pmos that was where then he wrote his un record that is the reason why when John wrote about the I mean the beginning of his book he never wrote about the H physical geneology of Jesus Christ the physical generation of Jesus Christ he went back to the beginning he said in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and all things were made by him and without him there was nothing made amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen amen when when when Matthew wrote about his beginning he he says the birth of Jesus was on this wise praise the Lord Jesus the son of David the son of Abraham he went into the physical geneology of Jesus Christ Luke did the same thing there is a little difference between Matthew and Luke we'll find that up in the future but John when he would write about the one that he he loved the one that he was called to belov of he went back to the beginning he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he dropped down to verse 12 he says that word that was in the beginning put on flesh it became flesh are we together am so we know definitely that he was talking about Jesus are we together in the beginning God it's very interesting there there's lot of lot of thoughts and a lot of areas in my mind I want to go into but it's it's it's trying to take me off of uh my my uh you know what what uh my inspiration is what what actually I want to say to you this morning because like we said on Wednesday night if if if God if Elohim the self-existing God if he would give himself a beginning because he had to come from Spirit he had to come from from uh uh from from being an internal one to condense himself to begin time if he will have to give himself a beginning if Moses were write and says in the beginning God if John were WR and says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God if we will have all those record about our creator is to show us that how God have so much interest in the beginning amen amen he have interest in The Way We Begin things in what our beginning is praise the Lord I believe he have interest in how we are beginning this year glory be to God God the beginning of anything is very important just like I said this is a record of the beginning of time the beginning of time if Moos Moses is giving us a record of the beginning of time and he says in the beginning God praise the Lord Lord he never went for all the science theor about the Big Bang about Evolution no he said in the beginning God and I mean I can close my book this morning and just run down the AE and says that yeah if we ever have any success in anything our beginning must be God praise the Lord amen if we will have success in anything in time you didn't create time God created time you don't order time the one that begin time begin time with himself he was the beginning of time that's the reason why everything that he made remains whatever he wanted to do he have succeeded he wanted to express himself he wanted us as his creatures to know his attributes that he's a savior we know he's a savior because he died for our sin he wanted us to know that he's a Healer because he healed our sickness and because we believe that he healed that's the reason why we pray for our brother because we believe that God is going to heal [Music] him amen God is successful because his beginning was good amen because his beginning was good he is he's very successful in everything anything he said comes to pass why because his beginning was good amen before he will even start time he thought about it in his mind he thought of you am amen amen praise the Lord if the creator of the universe if the creator of the universe the one that has our birth praise the lord we can go to sleep and then he can he can just he can just suck it out of us and we will lay right there like a DE body not like a dead body we will be dead praise the Lord if he will think about his work what he want to achieve what he want to do he would take a time and think about it in his mind and the Bible says his Works will be finished in his mind he would think perfect and I'm going to do it prise God hallelujah then he will step down that's the reason why every day of creation God said it was good it's never recorded that he said well I made a mistake today I would I would make it better tomorrow the Bible says every day every thing he made he said it was good why because he had a good beginning am praise the Lord and the second day he says it was good the third he said it was good praise the Lord hallelujah amen when he came to the sixth day he said it was very there you go he said it was very good when he got a man in His image praise the Lord he said it was very good it's almost like I like it this is what I wanted to do I like it but it all had to do with the preparation from the beginning praise the Lord they all have to do about it whe whether you believe it or not but that's the Bible that's what he said in this word for God to be able to make us to know his attributes you know what he did he created his own adversary that we call the devil and when he made him he made him perfect which mean he will be a good liar that's right and the Bible say he's the father of it praise the Lord I will make this one when he ready to deceive he will deceive praise the Lord the Bible said he was made perfect in the day that he was created but what I'm trying to bring to your mind this morning is how God invested in in the beginning we would we we would not have been here if if there was not a beginning amen praise the Lord amen in the beginning God I pray let our beginning be God praise the Lord there is one thing that inspired me to this and what inspired me to this to be Earnest with you is there with all of the things that are happening around the Christian word around the message of the hour that many of us know you know and and and and all of that I realized that uh if we don't be truth to this word it's just a matter of time if we don't be truth to this word it's just a matter of time all of these thing we are doing here will fade out amen and we will and we will we will make our stories about it praise the Lord I was there that was one of the last message I preached there in South Africa I was there there there in the uh in the guest room and I was just I was just thinking about things and and and and thinking about this and saying Lord I don't know how many how many time I you know how much time I have on the earth the group that I went to preach for is uh is uh is one of the pastor there he passed away get a gold and uh uh the meeting was towards the anniversary of his going home and all of that and uh uh I mean uh it's it's no time to to food around it's no time to foood around are we just coming to church because we want to make church we want to make a group where we can just P one another on the back if there's ever a time that we must be truth to one another like Paul the Apostle says we must preach this word we must we must speak the truth in love that's why he said that's why he said in the book of Ephesians we must speak this truth in love not targeting anybody but we must tell one another the truth am amen praise the Lord please if there is something you know I'm doing that is not according to the word of God come tell me I'm not saying it in a boastful way I'm saying it that I need help amen if you think that no this thing is not according to the word praise the Lord amen because like Paul says should I preach this gospel and be cast in hell which of course there's a possibility if I'm not Earnest in truth to what I'm preaching I come and preach to you then I go to the house and be whing my children and be fing with my wife and all of that what kind of a gospel is that that I can't live what I'm preaching praise the Lord am that's the reason why I think you know if if if God should help us let's visit our beginning we we can always have a new beginning praise the lord we don't need a devil to crack our heads on our mistakes that we have made we can have a new beginning because the word says it any man is in Christ behold he is a new creature all things have passed away and behold all things are new amen we can have a new beginning how can we say the Rapture is our future if we are not preparing ourself and preparing the people for for the Rapture yeah we just have have in our mind to have some kind of Amiga Church you know oh how how I wish this church can can can grow so you know I I I can have money and change my home and and and and buy a brand new car and and all of that that that's not the purpose of the Gospel amen in the beginning God if we will be successful God has to be in our beginning if we will be successful whether in your career praise the Lord in your marriages in your home in this church if we will be successful God has to be our beginning praise the Lord amen not not not our own ideas not the thing that we think will work for us we must come we must come back to the word of God praise the Lord every success that a man has achieved we find God is just temporary amen it have date and time it has it has a beginning date it has an expiring date amen all of men's achievement has a beginning date and has an expiring date God achievement is internal because when he begins with us we don't go to the grave and be finished even after after the grave this body drops and you go right into a teopan [Music] body praise the Lord amen the grave is not our end praise the Lord amen the grave is not our end I saw something uh uh that that blew my mind I thought I was going to share it with you but uh I mean I went on singing and I forgot what I that I supposed to be preaching it kind of for blew my mind and uh uh I will find it and share it with you some sometime is I'm I'm getting out of time here but I it was something about the glorified body praise the Lord amen and know just like Paul taught in the book of Corinthian he says all you know All Flesh are not the same he says they are different flesh they are flesh that we eat they are flesh that we hang on our wall praise the Lord and but uh he he he also let us to know he he taught us uh that we we have uh uh uh h a terrestrial body which is the one that we are in Praise the Lord we have a Celestial body and uh uh and then we have a glorified body praise the Lord amen and uh uh uh uh uh it blew my mind I really like to to share that with you and and and and kind of for read the uh read the quot I I think it would be a blessing than than just paraphrasing it but you see uh that's that is the reason why uh uh we make very important emphasis on creating the right atmosphere and creating the atmosphere of the holy spirit that is the reason why we strive to do everything to preserve this place in the best way that we can we don't want noise we don't uh uh we don't set it out for party nothing we just want it to be a place where we can come and worship the Lord praise the Lord because it's very very important it I made it really blow my mind brother B was talking about the presence of the Holy Spirit as as uh as as uh as uh your your glorified body you know that's why he says he says uh you bump into your te funny you know when that atmosphere is created and uh but I'll share that with you if I can if I can be able to put out the quot so it's very very important Even in our in our home the way we treat our home the things we do you know uh uh because I mean God is Not uh uh just in the four walls of our building he's a spirit amen and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen are we together Amen in the beginning God yeah that's how Mo how Moses started his record until now that's the reason why the Jews reverence him he's the greatest Prophet have ever been among men praise the Lord hallelujah because we know we know the story of Moses how he was educated in Egypt he grew up learned all the wisdom of Egypt praise the Lord amen he had his mother as his Sunday school teacher she taught him from Young and being his mother she instructed him told him so the seeds of of uh of of of Truth in his heart and the Bible will says in the book of Acts chapter 7 that Moses heart was towards the children of Israel even though he was in an Egyptian Kingdom but his heart was towards the children of Israel and one day when it was time he got there trying to identify himself with the people and seeing all their struggling and fighting and everything they were going through he got an Egyptian and killed him praise the Lord thinking that he will have worn the favor of his people trying to win men's favor that is the greatest lie you can ever put in your own mind praise the Lord amen trying to do something to win a man's favor it will fail all the time it's temporary it's only for that ask yourself how many things will you do to win his favor right because if you win his favor today tomorrow another thing will happen again trying to win the favor of his people he killed an Egyptian and then when two was struggling he think he would tell them you people are brothers you should not be fighting who make you Lord over us you want to kill me like you did the Egyptian Moses fell rejected amen praise the Lord rejection took him out of Egypt and he went into the Wilderness glory be to God forgot about his SS forgot about his military knowledge and Military idea he took a new new career to be a Shepherd boy he was just hiding behind it but God knows where you are hiding wherever you are hiding behind God knows where you are hiding Moses was just hiding behind shepher boy he was praise the Lord when God got ready for him God gave him a beginning when Moses said in the beginning he know what it is because when he met the pillow of fire when he met the burning bush that was the beginning of Moses that was the beginning of a deliverer [Applause] thank you Lord praise the Lord that was the beginning of Moses he got a beginning because he have met God the one that his mother told him about the preacher has preached to him he have met God he came face to face with God Amen and God allowed him to experience the supernatural amen prise the Lord amen not only the ones around him because he threw his stick down it turned into seent but God allowed his physical body to experience the Supernatural and that's what we need we need our our physical body not something that we read or something that we know when our life can go through a transformation power experience thank you Lord praise the Lord amen God allowed him to experience put your hand in your bosom when he took it out he was afraid of his own hand but he couldn't run from it wherever he go it will follow him amen praise the Lord amen which of course leprosy always represent sin you can never run away from your weakness amen you can never run away from your weakness whatever you are physically struggling with you can't run away from it praise the Lord no you can't run away from it hallelujah amen amen the sooner you come to realize and identify that this is my problem and I need help there you go the sooner you'll be delivered he couldn't run away from it he cried to God praise the Lord no doubt no down he he he he he yell he ran the same voice told him put your hand back in your bosom amen praise the Lord amen I'm sure when Moses put it there and God said take it out he was thinking what am I going to see again amen amen amen what am I going to see you see that's the reason why brother Bram says the people are afraid of the new birth Lord people just feel enough to be church members but really don't want to be changed they are afraid Hallelujah do you mean that when I'm really born again I'm I'm no longer going to have this pleasure I'm no longer going to enjoy this God is not thinking about doing a half will work in you if God want to change you he want to change you completely neither do we halfway work praise the Lord let me tell you if God if God change you you can never trace your life back to that you won't find a road to go back to it because what he does is that he takes the desire praise the Lord when the desire is taking there there is no way you can do it we do what we do because we have the desire to do it praise the Lord amen we know drunkers and smokers and people that were on drugs that God has changed they don't have the taste of it Hallelujah they don't have the desire of it praise the Lord even to stay in a company of people smoking it make them sick but they were the same people that were smoking four cigarette and three cigarette day God don't do a halfway work praise the Lord when Moses took his hands up it was better than the the left hand praise praise the Lord if God change your life it will be better than the one you have always [Music] had it will be better than the on you always have praise the Lord but he had a beginning the one that ran from Egypt in his new beginning was ready to conquer Egypt praise the Lord amen he ran from egyp but in his new beginning when he begin with God when you begin with God there is nothing in your life you will not conquer Hallelujah there is no desire no habit that you will not [Music] conquer praise the Lord amen I'm not saying your knowledge of God I'm saying beginning with God Amen beginning with the person of God Amen he ran away from Egypt but when he begin with God when Moses says in the beginning God I believe he T about that day of the Bush being on fire praise the Lord amen and being a science student he was thinking about chemistry I'm seeing the leaves fire the leaves are not burning wow right praise the Lord hallelujah amen but God was thinking about another chemistry the chemistry was to take this fear out of this deliverer this man that was born put on the the river of n with alligator I watch over him as a baby I kept him and and and and and he went into Pharaoh house I even put his mother on salary to take care of him praise the Lord and every year keeping himself in the wilderness he said he's he's a Shepherd I called you and kept you to deliver my people not to leave these few Jal ships praise the Lord and I believe when God look down from heaven that's the same thing he said he says about our life I watch over you I deliver you from from from sicknesses when you came to the time of a close to death movement I was there I watch over you I've kept you for the purpose because I want you to be a Son of God a daughter of God to stand for my name in this age praise the Lord and we have our mind so filled with our Ambitions and desires and and all of that it's beautiful very beautiful to have all of those things but you must also know your calling you must know your calling praise the Lord you must know your calling because no matter what job you have and what level you have grown in the company you can still be fire that company can still go bankrupt and you can lose your job job but the purpose that God has kept you for you can never lose it praise the Lord because almighty God is going to make sure that he fulfilled that in your life he had a beginning with God in the beginning God and when Moses had his beginning with God Egypt was no longer the place that he he was afraid to go right praise the Lord you see Moses was running away from his past yeah he was running away from his past he was trying to cut off from his past praise the Lord amen amen amen he went so far away that nobody will find him nobody would would hear about him praise the Lord amen if I can if I can guess I might be wrong but if I can guess he even changed his name that's that's my guess okay don't don't carry it it's my guess praise the Lord because that's what we do when we are running away from our past yes you know we try to take we try to take uh create a Max for ourself you know if either we grow our head more than it used to be praise the Lord or we change our dress code you know and just start to dress like uh you know like a free dresser so people can identify us with that praise the Lord but he had a beginning with God that's that's my emphasis amen and when he begin with God his past couldn't haunt him anymore he went right dead into Egypt and he said not let God people go he said let my people go amen praise the Lord he said let my people go he looked at the past in the face and said let my people go praise the Lord he never had to explain himself to the people that rejected him no no no no why because he have had a beginning with God he have had a beginning with God Amen he never needed to call conference let all the ELD of Israel come let me explain you're sorry you know our year before I'm very sorry I uh I ran away you know and then when I went I saw one girl I got married to her Moses never had time for that he just went straight over to the palace and say I want to see the Pharaoh praise the Lord amen amen I want to see the Pharaoh praise the Lord and as and according to history it proves that the very Pharaoh the very King that was Pharaoh in Egypt at that time grew with Moses in the palace so when he saw him he knew him amen amen but that didn't bother Moses why because he had a beginning with God praise the Lord amen we had a beginning with God if we have a beginning with God every day will be a good day Moses said in the beginning God every day was a good day everything that God made was good amen praise the Lord amen my prayer for you is that God should give every one of us a beginning with him praise the Lord he gave us a beginning with him amen amen I promise you there is nothing that you gave to God that he don't take care of he take care of it better then we can take care of fath Praise the Lord when Simon gave him his boat to preach he gave Simon a boat full of fish praise the Lord he's a good neighbor God is a good neighbor he don't SPO what you give to him if you give him something he's going to make a good use out of it the Lord could be said this morning I'm feel impressed to stay on this thought let's have a good beginning with God Amen Let our beginning be with God
