[40:07] this will be
[40:08] to the young brothers
[40:12] praise the lord
[40:22] and
[40:25] okay and also we were planning uh
[40:30] just before uh 2020 brought a surprise
[40:35] to us we thought last year
[40:37] we were planning to do some some some
[40:40] tour
[40:41] for for the young people and thinking
[40:43] about what to what to do
[40:46] to be able to have some time to spend
[40:49] together
[40:50] and just and just maybe make a trip
[40:54] but uh with with everything they have
[40:56] happening around us
[40:57] and around the world we could not do
[40:59] that so this year we
[41:01] we've been trying to work on something
[41:03] so we have brother
[41:05] but andrews and
[41:08] sister christian we kind of appoint them
[41:11] to work on
[41:12] a city tour for us so there are some
[41:16] historical uh
[41:19] what what i wanted for us to do was to
[41:21] visit some of the
[41:23] religious sites in uh in minneapolis
[41:27] a couple of years back there was a paper
[41:29] that came through
[41:31] through our office uh were there were
[41:34] there were
[41:35] certain sites you know there were
[41:40] according to that paper minneapolis is a
[41:43] very
[41:44] religious city religious in the sense
[41:47] that
[41:48] there are a lot of religious things
[41:51] happening you know and and there were
[41:54] some some sites
[41:56] even place of uh you know where cults
[41:59] gather and different things you know
[42:03] so uh
[42:06] i thought that uh we were going to
[42:10] work on there to be able to visit those
[42:13] sites
[42:13] but it looks like the the group that
[42:16] started there
[42:18] maybe they never got enough business and
[42:20] maybe they went out of business so
[42:22] we tried to trace them and we couldn't
[42:24] get any information on them so we
[42:26] decided to
[42:27] do something on our own so brother
[42:30] brother
[42:31] brother andrews have been able to come
[42:32] up with some uh
[42:34] historical churches in minneapolis
[42:37] and some of the history that have to go
[42:40] with them so
[42:41] we are planning to have a saturday where
[42:44] we can
[42:45] we can be able to do a tour of of of
[42:48] those few places
[42:49] and i thought
[42:53] we could have uh put it on there
[42:56] saturday of labor day
[42:58] but it will be too tight and
[43:01] and and some might be
[43:04] not be able to partake so we will find a
[43:06] better
[43:07] weekend and then we will let you know uh
[43:11] the cops that might go with there
[43:13] because we want to
[43:14] pretty much keep everybody together they
[43:16] talk
[43:17] in a way that brother andrews did it uh
[43:20] the torah is somehow self-guided it
[43:24] leads you from one side to another so
[43:27] you can
[43:28] you can drive on your own but the thing
[43:30] about it there is that we will now wait
[43:32] for you
[43:36] we're not going to get yet and says uh
[43:38] oh i mean traffic coming in they say
[43:40] okay let's wait uh brother one is coming
[43:42] let's wait for him
[43:43] until he gets here
[43:46] you know so if you can drive on your own
[43:49] that would be nice
[43:50] you know if you can be able to get there
[43:53] and and
[43:54] what we want to do is that with all the
[43:56] information we have we would like to
[43:58] share
[43:58] with you ahead of time if you want to
[44:00] make some research on those places
[44:03] and be able to share with us what you
[44:05] what you gather
[44:07] you know because it would just be a time
[44:10] an outdoor
[44:11] time where we just want to just visit
[44:14] our city that we live in
[44:15] you know and uh i got the thought of
[44:18] this uh
[44:19] uh years back like i said and and
[44:22] and the the thing that came to my mind
[44:25] is that uh
[44:27] you know daniel the the prince of pesha
[44:30] you know
[44:31] uh uh handled down your prayer and then
[44:34] somewhere brother branham says if the
[44:35] prince of pesha
[44:37] handled down their prayer for 21 days
[44:39] what would the prince of laodicea do
[44:41] and and the truth about the mata that is
[44:44] that every spirit
[44:45] have a prince that's the reason why
[44:48] every city
[44:50] has an influence
[44:54] the people in new york behave different
[44:57] from the people in minneapolis
[45:01] you know so all of those things go back
[45:04] into
[45:04] you know uh uh uh you know spiritual
[45:08] warfare and all of that
[45:09] but it's good for you to know for us to
[45:11] know the environment that we live in
[45:13] praise the lord
[45:14] so when we come here we will know that
[45:16] uh you know
[45:17] there are a lot of a lot of demons that
[45:19] fight us before we get here on wednesday
[45:21] night
[45:22] you know because uh the devil would want
[45:24] us to do
[45:26] everything but not to be here
[45:29] thinking walter is the lamb amen
[45:33] i mean he will just want us to do
[45:35] everything and anything
[45:37] but not to be here on wednesday night
[45:40] you know uh uh you know he might not
[45:43] even mind you
[45:44] reading your bible on your own and as
[45:46] much as it can create a lot of
[45:48] distraction for you not to concentrate
[45:50] and just get you in a religious flow i'm
[45:53] reading my bible
[45:54] but he knows the supernatural strain
[45:56] that comes
[45:57] when we come together you know
[46:00] when we bring our faith together before
[46:04] we leave from here the faith has to be
[46:06] hundred percent
[46:07] and it becomes hundred percent when he
[46:09] show up
[46:13] praise the lord when he show up
[46:16] then it becomes the faith of the son of
[46:18] god himself
[46:20] that's why we can say all things are
[46:22] possible so
[46:24] uh we will we will come up with a dead
[46:27] and uh and develop what we have
[46:30] and then we will let you know and also
[46:32] share with you what the cost
[46:34] you know years back we we were almost
[46:36] giving everything free from this church
[46:39] you know we we will we will do
[46:43] you know uh young people think
[46:46] it's free we bring you food with
[46:49] everything
[46:50] at a certain time i just thought that
[46:54] you know those kind of a kindness
[46:59] intention our intention is not to do
[47:02] justice to this subject
[47:04] our intention is to bring an inspiration
[47:07] out of the subject
[47:08] to be able to edify the sins tonight
[47:12] praise the lord so with that being said
[47:17] uh i we want to look at few scriptures
[47:20] in the bible
[47:21] that talks about one hour
[47:26] praise the lord
[47:30] are we together
[47:35] daniel chapter four
[47:54] daniel chapter four
[48:14] down in chapter four let's look at verse
[48:16] 18.
[48:18] i don't want to do too much of reading i
[48:21] just want to
[48:23] use that to be able to
[48:26] uh keep ourselves together keep our
[48:30] thoughts together tonight
[48:32] verse 18 this dream a dream this this
[48:35] dream i
[48:36] king nebuchadnezzar have seen
[48:39] now there are all bethesdas that declare
[48:41] the interpretation thereof
[48:43] for as much as all the wise men of
[48:47] my kingdom are not able to make known
[48:50] unto me the interpretation but thou
[48:54] art able for the spirit of the holy
[48:58] ghost
[48:59] is indeed then daniel whose name was
[49:02] bertie schezer was
[49:07] he was atoned for one hour
[49:11] and he started trouble him
[49:16] the king speak and said bethesda let
[49:20] let net the dream or the interpretation
[49:23] there of troubled
[49:25] betty shares the answer and said my lord
[49:28] the dream to them
[49:32] that hit thee and the interpretation
[49:34] thereof
[49:35] to thine enemies
[49:39] so uh uh i'll be i was able to pick up
[49:43] that one let's look at matthew chapter
[49:45] 12.
[49:46] i'm just trying to
[49:49] trying to uh make myself comfortable a
[49:52] little bit with
[49:53] with what i want to bring tonight so
[49:55] just bear with me
[50:09] matthew chapter 20
[50:24] amen
[50:30] let's read from verse eight so when eden
[50:33] was come the lord
[50:35] of the vania said unto his stewards
[50:37] called the laborers and gave them
[50:40] the highest beginning from the last on
[50:42] to the first
[50:43] and when they came that were
[50:47] higher about the 11th hour
[50:51] they received every man a penny
[50:56] but when the first came they suppose
[50:59] that they
[51:00] should have received more
[51:03] and they likewise receive every man a
[51:06] penny
[51:08] and when they have received
[51:11] the mummer against the goodman of the
[51:13] house saying
[51:15] these laws have rough but
[51:19] one hour have only one hour of work
[51:24] and thou have made them equal unto us
[51:28] which have bought the burdens of the
[51:32] heat of the day
[51:33] so we see another one hour
[51:39] are we together i might read a quote on
[51:44] that a little bit matthew chapter 26
[51:50] matthew chapter 26
[51:54] let's read from verse 38
[51:58] then say he unto them my soul exceeding
[52:01] sorrowful
[52:02] even unto death entire year year
[52:05] and watch with me
[52:09] and he went a little farther and fell on
[52:11] his face
[52:12] and prayed saying oh father oh my father
[52:15] if it be possible let this cup cup pass
[52:18] from me
[52:19] nevertheless not as i will
[52:23] but as thou will
[52:28] and he cometh unto his disciples and and
[52:30] and find them asleep and said unto peter
[52:33] what could ye now watch with me
[52:37] one hour praise the lord
[52:49] now we read uh there in
[52:55] revelation chapter 17 revelation chapter
[52:59] 18
[53:00] verse 10.
[53:11] let's read from verse 8 therefore shall
[53:14] her play come
[53:15] in one day death and mourning farming
[53:18] and she shall be ultimately burned with
[53:21] fire
[53:23] for strong is the lord who judges her
[53:26] and the kings of the earth who have
[53:27] committed fornication
[53:29] and live delicious slave with her
[53:33] shall bewell her and lament for her
[53:36] when they see the smoke
[53:40] of her burning standing a far off
[53:44] for the fear of atomic saying alas alas
[53:48] thy great city babylon the mighty city
[53:51] for in one hour is
[53:54] that judgment come
[53:58] so uh i just read those few
[54:02] uh uh verses tonight
[54:06] just like i said to canada for uh um
[54:10] kind of for free myself a little bit
[54:13] take the nervousness away
[54:15] but
[54:19] now what caught my attention on this
[54:22] i was studying on the message the
[54:25] rejecter came
[54:27] and and uh uh
[54:31] my inspiration on the rejected king is
[54:33] to show
[54:35] that how the word is the king
[54:38] of our kingdom the word of god
[54:43] amen is the king of
[54:46] our kingdom our king is called the word
[54:50] of god
[54:52] that's the lord jesus christ but most of
[54:55] the time
[54:56] when we talk about the lord jesus christ
[54:59] it's so easy
[55:00] for the mind of people to travel back to
[55:02] jesus of nazareth and now realize
[55:07] that the lord jesus christ in our day is
[55:10] his word
[55:13] praise the lord so the the the
[55:17] the thought here is the other uh
[55:20] god has always
[55:23] had a chain of command he has always led
[55:26] his people he has been the king of his
[55:28] people
[55:29] and uh and god uh chain of command
[55:35] uh that was established in the old
[55:37] testament is the law just like
[55:39] paul in the new testament says christ
[55:42] and then and and then is the man and the
[55:45] woman and and just like that
[55:47] the head of every man is christ the head
[55:49] of the woman is the man and you know
[55:51] just like that
[55:52] so it has been in this chain of command
[55:55] where it has been
[55:56] almighty god leading his people
[55:59] then the people requested that god must
[56:02] speak to a prophet
[56:04] and then god told the prophet call a
[56:07] priesthood
[56:10] and then and then after that we realized
[56:15] the office of a king was was little
[56:18] introduced so it's god a prophet
[56:22] you know the priesthood and then the
[56:24] king
[56:26] and uh and there were few men in the
[56:29] scripture
[56:29] moses is one he was both prophet he was
[56:32] priests
[56:33] and he was king praise the lord
[56:37] david in the time also fulfilled that
[56:40] he was a prophet he was a priest when he
[56:43] ate the short bread
[56:45] and he was a king and the next man that
[56:48] also fulfilled that
[56:50] is our lord jesus he was a prophet
[56:53] after moses he was the king a priest
[56:56] after the order of mechistic and
[57:00] he is our king of kings and lord of
[57:03] lords
[57:04] praise the lord so we we see
[57:07] that chain of command and and in the way
[57:10] that it works
[57:12] is that you know just like
[57:15] yeah or israel the lord our god is one
[57:19] god have always used one man
[57:24] praise the lord if god raised up a man
[57:28] to be a prophet
[57:29] he will have one prophet on the scene
[57:33] at a time that the word of the lord
[57:36] will come to are we together
[57:41] amen god
[57:44] order of leadership does not resemble
[57:48] anything
[57:49] like what we have uh uh uh
[57:52] in into this world with with democracy
[57:56] and no god order of leadership
[57:59] has always been one man the king
[58:06] he has never never encouraged or
[58:09] established an opposing party
[58:16] every opposing party to god established
[58:19] himself
[58:20] in in rebelling to god's word
[58:25] they decide to to start opposing god but
[58:28] god
[58:28] never said well you become the opposing
[58:31] party i will be the leading party left
[58:33] fight and see
[58:33] we will win the next election nope god
[58:36] do not lead like that
[58:41] praise the lord so also the same thing
[58:44] comes down to
[58:46] the priesthood there are many priests
[58:48] that will do many work in
[58:50] in the in the tabernacle but there is
[58:52] only
[58:53] one high priest they have never been too
[58:57] high priests at a time
[59:00] now so all of this form of of of
[59:02] leadership
[59:04] that god have in in his uh uh
[59:07] uh hierarchy or chain of command is
[59:10] all in the sense that god
[59:13] always lead by his word
[59:19] praise the lord god always
[59:22] lead by his word
[59:26] so just like i said now uh
[59:29] we saw koran and dalton trying to
[59:32] fight against moses and say moses it is
[59:35] just you it's always
[59:36] you in it and and you have tried to make
[59:39] yourself something
[59:40] and god was never pleased with that he
[59:42] opened the earth
[59:43] and he swallowed him up
[59:46] there is no competition with god
[59:51] praise the lord i mean
[59:55] there is no competition with god and
[59:58] uh uh you know even the
[1:00:02] uh the sons of aaron that were called to
[1:00:04] the priesthood
[1:00:07] when they were trying to take it as a
[1:00:10] personal privilege to do
[1:00:12] things that they were not supposed to do
[1:00:16] god slid him he was the same one that
[1:00:19] told
[1:00:20] moses called aaron and your sons to the
[1:00:22] priesthood
[1:00:23] but when he started to do things that
[1:00:25] were contrary to god's word
[1:00:27] he got rid of them
[1:00:31] because god is not in a competition
[1:00:34] business
[1:00:35] he in the business of leading people
[1:00:39] he's in the leadership business not a
[1:00:42] competition business
[1:00:46] praise the lord now so we see all of
[1:00:49] these
[1:00:50] types in the bible and
[1:00:54] so you know if you look at the subject
[1:00:57] of the rejected king and you go back and
[1:00:59] study that message
[1:01:01] you know it almost looked like the
[1:01:03] people rejected samya the emphasis was
[1:01:06] made
[1:01:07] but where the emphasis is actually is
[1:01:10] the rejection
[1:01:11] of the word
[1:01:16] it's the rejection of the word
[1:01:21] now when adam and eve broke the word of
[1:01:24] god
[1:01:25] everything
[1:01:29] went into this other so it was the word
[1:01:31] that was keeping everything
[1:01:33] it was the word that was keeping eating
[1:01:35] the way eden was
[1:01:42] so adam in governing the earth or
[1:01:45] governing the garden of eden at that
[1:01:47] time
[1:01:48] his his uh uh his authority was coming
[1:01:52] from the word
[1:01:54] for him to be successful he had to be
[1:01:56] subject to the word
[1:01:59] when they broke the word they lost
[1:02:04] everything
[1:02:07] i say that again young people god is not
[1:02:10] in a competition business god
[1:02:13] is in a leadership business
[1:02:17] would it surprise you that was what the
[1:02:20] the last message that brother brandon
[1:02:22] preached
[1:02:24] one of the last is if not the last
[1:02:25] leadership
[1:02:27] now so your your and and then
[1:02:30] seeing that in studying that that was
[1:02:34] word my mind got cut to this
[1:02:36] to this subject that we want to talk
[1:02:38] about a little bit
[1:02:40] here in revelation chapter 17.
[1:02:44] and and i will read this to you but
[1:02:48] it will also bring out
[1:02:51] the beauty of the gift
[1:02:55] of a prophet let's take this
[1:02:58] mark of the beast uh i realized i have
[1:03:02] two of them here but
[1:03:03] uh uh they are they are on two different
[1:03:07] uh subjects let's take the last one in
[1:03:10] my in my notes here
[1:03:14] now and the ten horns
[1:03:18] which there saw where the thin kings
[1:03:23] which have received
[1:03:26] no kingdom praise the lord
[1:03:30] they have received no kingdom as yet but
[1:03:33] receive
[1:03:34] power as king one hour with the peace
[1:03:39] or if we could just receive no power as
[1:03:42] yet
[1:03:43] they are not kings because they don't
[1:03:46] have
[1:03:46] kingdom
[1:03:50] praise the lord you see it it takes
[1:03:53] it takes an eye of inspiration it takes
[1:03:56] an
[1:03:56] eye like we would say an ego eye
[1:03:59] to be able to just read right between
[1:04:02] the line
[1:04:03] and understand what is happening there
[1:04:06] praise the lord
[1:04:09] they are not kings
[1:04:16] they didn't have which means they didn't
[1:04:18] have kingdom
[1:04:19] their homes didn't have crown they
[1:04:23] received
[1:04:23] power like king what is
[1:04:27] it a detector
[1:04:35] praise the lord amen
[1:04:39] it's a dictator not crown
[1:04:42] king and we know
[1:04:45] you know if you if you if you look at
[1:04:47] the political world we see
[1:04:48] that you know uh uh in
[1:04:52] in in parts of the world where
[1:04:55] dictators has ruled you know uh
[1:04:58] they try to change all all the
[1:05:00] constitution change everything
[1:05:03] to to stay in power for as long as they
[1:05:06] live
[1:05:08] so but by the year we realize i mean
[1:05:11] when we get into the study itself you'll
[1:05:13] be able to see
[1:05:14] you know some of those some of those
[1:05:16] things and and and
[1:05:18] i mean how how they came to power how
[1:05:20] they were appointed by the roman church
[1:05:24] to rule over certain cities
[1:05:28] they were appointed by the church they
[1:05:30] were influenced into
[1:05:32] office by the church
[1:05:37] just to keep the interest of the church
[1:05:42] praise the lord and we can run down into
[1:05:45] many many ali with these things and
[1:05:49] uh so we see here that uh
[1:05:52] uh uh the holy spirit is kind of for
[1:05:54] pointing something out when you think
[1:05:56] about it
[1:05:57] in the form of leadership god has never
[1:06:00] ordained
[1:06:01] a detector
[1:06:04] praise the lord and and and
[1:06:07] and and and and a man that is a detector
[1:06:10] is a man that would rule out of law
[1:06:15] he would create his own law
[1:06:18] praise the lord amen he will create
[1:06:21] his own lord even almighty god our king
[1:06:25] our prophet our our our praise
[1:06:28] he subject himself to his own word
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:35] praise the lord so
[1:06:40] in that sense it keeps the word
[1:06:43] on the throne and not the man
[1:06:47] if the man is subject to the word it
[1:06:50] keeps the word is what is governing
[1:06:53] the man is just an instrument he's just
[1:06:56] an agent
[1:06:58] that the word is using but it's the word
[1:07:01] that is governing the people
[1:07:05] praise the lord
[1:07:08] whether it comes to the king or it comes
[1:07:11] to the prophet
[1:07:12] or it comes even us to
[1:07:15] the local church
[1:07:21] praise the lord
[1:07:27] the pastor and everyone a subject to the
[1:07:30] word
[1:07:31] is the word that is governed is the word
[1:07:33] that is governing the church
[1:07:36] we must be able to look at the word and
[1:07:38] the word alone
[1:07:40] when we start to create things to make
[1:07:43] the church to work
[1:07:44] we're becoming a detector
[1:07:49] and then one one of the easier way is
[1:07:51] that
[1:07:52] to start something that appease to the
[1:07:54] people
[1:07:55] that's what the dictator does he do
[1:07:58] things that we appear to the people
[1:08:00] the people get happy about it and he use
[1:08:02] that verity to enslave them
[1:08:09] but when a man is subject to the word he
[1:08:12] knows that
[1:08:13] the people are looking at the word and
[1:08:15] when he breaks the word they can use the
[1:08:17] very same word
[1:08:18] to condemn him
[1:08:28] are we together
[1:08:32] so that's that is god's order
[1:08:37] from the beginning the great antenna
[1:08:39] spirit
[1:08:41] coming to time and to start creation to
[1:08:44] be able to
[1:08:44] to manifest his attribute he condemns
[1:08:48] himself
[1:08:49] into this form called the word the logos
[1:08:55] paul said by him all things
[1:08:59] consists without him there was there was
[1:09:01] nothing that was made
[1:09:04] so right from the beginning the word has
[1:09:06] been
[1:09:07] governing the earth we have in all the
[1:09:10] trouble today we have
[1:09:11] with heat and everything is because man
[1:09:15] in his so-called wise wisdom is going
[1:09:18] against the lord of god's word
[1:09:26] praise the lord as long as we keep the
[1:09:30] word
[1:09:30] on the throne of our heart our body
[1:09:34] we have to come in obedience
[1:09:37] because it was the word that spoke every
[1:09:40] atoms of your body into existing
[1:09:44] as long as you keep the word on the
[1:09:47] throne
[1:09:48] of your home that home is bound to come
[1:09:52] in obedience
[1:09:57] as long as you keep the word before you
[1:10:00] you are bound to win your fights
[1:10:10] paul says we that we have to know that
[1:10:12] everything that is made was made by the
[1:10:13] word of god
[1:10:16] so the word has control over everything
[1:10:22] praise the lord the word has control
[1:10:25] over everything
[1:10:28] are we together
[1:10:31] praise the lord amen
[1:10:35] and uh i i i was at work and
[1:10:38] i was i was listening to something and
[1:10:40] and and meditating
[1:10:42] and uh and and and and this thought came
[1:10:45] struck me it came clear and and i
[1:10:48] appreciated it because
[1:10:49] uh over and over i've been trying to say
[1:10:51] it but i i
[1:10:53] really never got a hold of it in a way
[1:10:55] that i wanted to say but it came
[1:10:57] in a way of a medical sense
[1:11:00] sometimes when a child is born
[1:11:04] from from from
[1:11:07] from birth sometimes the child have
[1:11:10] illness
[1:11:11] they are certain illness the doctors
[1:11:13] were now worried about
[1:11:14] the doctors will say their child will
[1:11:17] outgrow amen
[1:11:22] as a child grow they will outgrow their
[1:11:24] illness
[1:11:26] as long as you keep them in the right
[1:11:28] environment
[1:11:30] and give them the right food you keep
[1:11:31] them on their medication
[1:11:33] or whatever it is they will outgrow
[1:11:35] their illness
[1:11:37] because as as their cells as their body
[1:11:40] develop the changes that is taking place
[1:11:44] in their body you know will will help
[1:11:47] them to outgrow
[1:11:48] their illness
[1:11:52] praise the lord i was just looking at a
[1:11:55] at a
[1:11:56] at a documentary it was actually a news
[1:12:00] feeding and and and of of a little boy
[1:12:03] that was playing soccer
[1:12:04] and and and and then he went into a hit
[1:12:08] and got a concussion
[1:12:09] as he came out of the coming out of the
[1:12:12] concussion
[1:12:13] he started to speak a fluent french and
[1:12:16] affluent spanish
[1:12:18] when he never knew spanish in his life
[1:12:24] never knew spanish never spoke spanish
[1:12:27] in his life
[1:12:28] but now he speaks spanish
[1:12:33] something triggered in his brain that
[1:12:36] brought our spanish
[1:12:39] praise the lord so god has placed
[1:12:42] holiness in you
[1:12:45] he just needs you to get through the
[1:12:47] right kind of a trial that we trick of
[1:12:50] victory
[1:12:52] it will trick out clean living it will
[1:12:54] trick our holiness
[1:12:55] you can't practice it
[1:12:59] and just like in the natural where a
[1:13:02] child can
[1:13:02] outgrow illness in the spiritual
[1:13:06] we can outgrow the same sickness
[1:13:10] as we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:13:13] light
[1:13:14] we grow into mature christians and those
[1:13:17] things
[1:13:18] that bother us just far away
[1:13:21] there is no magic to it you just got
[1:13:25] to keep on the authority of
[1:13:28] the world
[1:13:32] praise the lord amen mark of the beast
[1:13:36] here we
[1:13:36] we read this one also in revelation
[1:13:39] let's take it
[1:13:39] also he says i will prove to you that
[1:13:43] communist
[1:13:44] is working straight in the hand of
[1:13:46] almighty god
[1:13:48] to destroy rome
[1:13:51] and remember i say this as god's
[1:13:54] prophet the rush the russian
[1:13:57] empire will drop an atomic bomb
[1:14:01] of some sort on the vatican city
[1:14:04] and destroy it in one hour
[1:14:10] thus said the lord
[1:14:13] amen and the bible
[1:14:17] said that god god took them crew
[1:14:21] had a man and put them in his hands
[1:14:24] and there were instruments in his hands
[1:14:26] to fulfill his will
[1:14:28] that would be the same thing with
[1:14:31] nebuchadnezzar
[1:14:34] praise the lord he ever said he had a
[1:14:37] dream
[1:14:38] and and and i mean just telling the
[1:14:40] dream
[1:14:41] daniel receiving the dream listening to
[1:14:44] the dream
[1:14:45] god trouble one hour
[1:14:50] the truth about the mouth of that is
[1:14:52] that because it was
[1:14:54] a divine inspiration it was something
[1:14:58] from
[1:14:58] god it was something that
[1:15:01] prophecy was titled
[1:15:05] this was the word of god
[1:15:09] coming to a pagan
[1:15:12] king a man that never knew god
[1:15:17] praise the lord amen
[1:15:20] now you can see it if you go back to the
[1:15:22] book of daniel
[1:15:23] when god gave nebuchadnezzar the dream
[1:15:28] he gave nebuchadnezzar the dream using
[1:15:32] an image of god and and brian's and
[1:15:35] silva but it was an image
[1:15:39] are we together it was an image just
[1:15:42] stay with me you would
[1:15:43] you grab what i'm going with this but in
[1:15:45] in daniel chapter 8 i think
[1:15:48] seven or eight when daniel started to
[1:15:51] receive the
[1:15:52] interpretation of the dream
[1:15:57] it came in the form of a lion a leper
[1:16:02] a bed
[1:16:06] it was the very same dream
[1:16:09] that nebuchadnezzar had
[1:16:14] so what was going to happen here is that
[1:16:17] that's the reason why in the scripture
[1:16:19] if you if you watch closely uh
[1:16:22] in the gospel and also in the writing of
[1:16:24] paul
[1:16:25] he talks about the time of the gentiles
[1:16:29] and the gentile dispensation
[1:16:33] many times it sounds like the simba is
[1:16:35] not the same
[1:16:37] the times of the gentile is more
[1:16:39] political
[1:16:46] and the and then and the gentile
[1:16:48] dispensation is tied to
[1:16:50] religious prophecy
[1:16:55] are we together now what i'm bringing
[1:16:58] out of here
[1:16:59] is is the one hour that daniel was
[1:17:02] trouble
[1:17:03] it was because of the effect of the
[1:17:06] dream
[1:17:12] are we together
[1:17:24] praise the lord
[1:17:27] question announced this year brother
[1:17:28] branham take this one we read also from
[1:17:30] matthew he says now
[1:17:32] i have to get another scripture here to
[1:17:36] show you jesus talked about the people
[1:17:39] that he said some come in
[1:17:42] an hour in one hour and another
[1:17:48] and another hour and there was 11 our
[1:17:52] people
[1:17:53] and the 11 hour people now
[1:17:57] you are spiritual read between the lines
[1:18:00] because i i've got to jump here
[1:18:04] and and uh come in and 11 hour people he
[1:18:07] went on i didn't want it to increase
[1:18:09] i mean just go on with with with all of
[1:18:11] that
[1:18:12] but he was also showing how the 11 hour
[1:18:15] people
[1:18:16] got the same amount of reward
[1:18:22] as those that started from the first
[1:18:25] hour of the day
[1:18:28] praise the lord amen
[1:18:32] as those that started from the first
[1:18:34] hour of the day
[1:18:35] now let's start there to something you
[1:18:38] spirit of truth brother branham says
[1:18:41] here
[1:18:42] i would rather oh god
[1:18:45] have a church with 50 people in it
[1:18:50] in the word of god than to have
[1:18:53] five thousand out of the word of god
[1:18:56] he says show god can do
[1:19:00] more with a man in his will
[1:19:03] in one hour than he came with a man
[1:19:09] out of his way in 50 years
[1:19:16] praise the lord and then if we bring the
[1:19:19] 11
[1:19:20] hour principle again to the church will
[1:19:23] realize that
[1:19:24] that's the reason why this last this
[1:19:27] church
[1:19:28] is is is uh is is coming to maturity or
[1:19:32] this last this
[1:19:33] church is the harvest group
[1:19:38] praise the lord this last year's church
[1:19:42] is the harvest group because we realize
[1:19:45] that the first three churches
[1:19:47] church ages was the great missionary
[1:19:50] age
[1:19:53] the holy ghost fell on the date of
[1:19:55] pentecost and
[1:19:56] and and and uh colena's house had an
[1:19:59] experience
[1:20:00] brother branham says god had to put
[1:20:02] persecution on the church
[1:20:03] to spread the apostles around the world
[1:20:06] it was the great missionary age
[1:20:09] now the fourth church age
[1:20:13] was the persecution age
[1:20:21] are we together the fourth church age
[1:20:24] was the persecution age it was it was
[1:20:27] the the ox
[1:20:30] anointing where they had to die
[1:20:33] for their faith praise the lord
[1:20:37] i mean when we go through little things
[1:20:39] we cry
[1:20:41] we complain but they were fair to the
[1:20:44] lions and burned to the stake in all of
[1:20:46] that
[1:20:48] but yet you realize that the seals did
[1:20:52] not open in that age
[1:20:55] the mystery of god was not revealed in
[1:20:58] that age
[1:21:01] god kept it for the last age
[1:21:07] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:21:10] when we show the position of john he was
[1:21:13] looking back
[1:21:16] and then he on us to all the things god
[1:21:18] was revealing
[1:21:19] the church edges to him we went through
[1:21:21] that now so we see
[1:21:23] here that uh
[1:21:29] this 11 hour people you know
[1:21:32] having the same the same reward the same
[1:21:35] benefit
[1:21:36] that's the reason why god promised to
[1:21:39] uh uh bring us back the pentecostal
[1:21:43] blessing amen
[1:21:44] restore our how return our hearts back
[1:21:47] to the faith
[1:21:48] of the fathers is for us to be able to
[1:21:51] get
[1:21:52] the same blessings that they receive at
[1:21:54] pentecost
[1:21:55] for us to be get the same blessing the
[1:21:58] same reward
[1:21:59] even though we are not burned to the
[1:22:00] stake even though we are not fair to
[1:22:03] lions
[1:22:05] but just for standing for his name in
[1:22:06] this age god is going to give
[1:22:08] us the same reward
[1:22:16] are we together amen
[1:22:21] that's the reason why god can get a hold
[1:22:23] of a young man or a young woman
[1:22:26] and he can have an experience and and i
[1:22:29] mean they can just
[1:22:30] they can just uh uh prosper in the word
[1:22:33] of god
[1:22:34] and someone that had been sitting in the
[1:22:36] message for over 50
[1:22:38] years
[1:22:41] they are just stuck
[1:22:44] into crease and darkness
[1:22:48] are we together
[1:22:53] even though they went to brother branham
[1:22:56] meeting even though they
[1:22:57] sat there they saw the supernatural
[1:23:01] praise the lord but the revelation of
[1:23:03] the world went right over their head
[1:23:11] the revelation of the word when right
[1:23:14] over their head it can be
[1:23:15] very dogmatic about brother branham
[1:23:17] share this i was seeing the tabernacle
[1:23:21] i was looking right at his face you hear
[1:23:23] what he said but you missed the
[1:23:24] revelation
[1:23:31] and the young repented heart can prosper
[1:23:34] in the word of god
[1:23:39] god can give them so so much balance
[1:23:46] you know people that saw the healing
[1:23:48] line the prayer line they can get stuck
[1:23:50] to the same place and say but
[1:23:51] i'm saying only 50 person will make it
[1:23:54] you know what they have done
[1:23:56] they just locked themselves out no
[1:23:58] desire to witness
[1:24:00] no desire to testify because they have
[1:24:02] already counted the 50 people that will
[1:24:04] make it
[1:24:04] and they let themselves out
[1:24:13] they count the 50 person and they
[1:24:15] already know the 50 percent or
[1:24:17] as much as they know they're not they
[1:24:19] are not part of the 50 person
[1:24:28] and god can do a quick work in one hour
[1:24:36] in one hour he can spin your life around
[1:24:48] praise the lord are we together
[1:24:52] amen am i making sense of this thing
[1:24:56] oh i'm just enjoying my own thing
[1:25:00] praise the lord i like it too when i'm
[1:25:03] enjoying my own thing
[1:25:04] it's when i'm not enjoying it that i get
[1:25:06] afraid
[1:25:09] praise the lord amen amen
[1:25:13] now let's take this other one here
[1:25:15] conference with god
[1:25:16] this one brother branham is is
[1:25:18] addressing the code
[1:25:19] of can you pray with me one hour
[1:25:22] i want to use this in in and close the
[1:25:24] thought tonight
[1:25:27] conference with god he said to his
[1:25:29] desire disciple wear it
[1:25:32] they had they had a lot
[1:25:35] of big meetings was tired perhaps
[1:25:40] like you are this evening and he said
[1:25:44] will you just
[1:25:45] watch with me one hour oh
[1:25:50] i have got to go yandere and have a
[1:25:52] conference
[1:25:55] praise the lord amen
[1:25:59] now you think about it now jesus was
[1:26:02] asking his disciples
[1:26:04] to watch with him one hour
[1:26:08] so like brother branham said
[1:26:11] uh in the message i think cruelty of sin
[1:26:15] he said that the entire decision
[1:26:19] of the word rested on his shoulder
[1:26:26] amen he had that
[1:26:32] free moral agency
[1:26:37] just like how adam
[1:26:42] left the word and choose to stay with
[1:26:44] his wife
[1:26:48] all of that was resting on jesus
[1:26:51] decision
[1:26:53] now and he was asking his disciple
[1:26:56] to pray pray with me one hour so let's
[1:26:59] take it in a sense that
[1:27:01] he had to deal with all of this pressure
[1:27:04] the bible says
[1:27:05] his spirit his soul was trouble
[1:27:12] one hour he had this intense
[1:27:16] pressure on him
[1:27:22] praise the lord
[1:27:25] amen and he had to bottle it
[1:27:30] the bible said he prayed he cried in
[1:27:33] agony
[1:27:35] he prayed he cried until he sweat
[1:27:38] and his sweat was as taken as blood
[1:27:48] praise the lord
[1:27:51] are we together one hour
[1:27:56] he had to make a choice
[1:28:02] one hour he had to make
[1:28:06] a choice
[1:28:10] praise the lord and you know what
[1:28:13] happened
[1:28:17] god left him alone
[1:28:23] god left him alone
[1:28:30] he was left to himself
[1:28:36] it was almost like something waking up
[1:28:39] and realized
[1:28:40] his head is gone
[1:28:51] he was feeling like a human god
[1:28:56] left him alone
[1:29:02] one hour
[1:29:07] one hour
[1:29:13] you know what it is when you feel alone
[1:29:17] one hour is too much of a time
[1:29:21] it's too much of a time
[1:29:31] are we together
[1:29:35] praise your lord
[1:29:39] and god left him alone
[1:29:45] when you watch with me in one hour oh i
[1:29:48] have got to go yonder and have a
[1:29:51] conference
[1:29:52] i have to go alone the conference was
[1:29:55] set
[1:29:56] and the lamb young
[1:29:59] a beautiful life
[1:30:02] i just read the other day broadband said
[1:30:04] he had a right to get married
[1:30:07] he had a right to choose to raise a
[1:30:10] family
[1:30:12] but he said father sanctify me
[1:30:16] for their sake
[1:30:20] a young beautiful life 33
[1:30:25] praise the lord amen
[1:30:30] i know as soon as i said 33 everybody
[1:30:32] started checking their age
[1:30:34] but it's okay
[1:30:41] the holy ghost caught you
[1:30:49] never a life like that never was never
[1:30:52] will be
[1:30:54] a life like that the lamb had
[1:30:57] but now the father said are you willing
[1:31:02] is your love for your brethren great
[1:31:06] enough
[1:31:11] praise the lord it's your love for your
[1:31:14] brethren is great enough
[1:31:16] is your love for that
[1:31:20] sinful stinking word that you were born
[1:31:24] in
[1:31:25] do you love them enough to fulfill
[1:31:28] for fit your life
[1:31:34] praise the lord
[1:31:41] you know when he fell
[1:31:46] and adam came home
[1:31:49] because when he fell chaos
[1:31:53] started right away chaos started right
[1:31:57] away
[1:31:58] the animals started barking at one
[1:31:59] another they started running i mean dust
[1:32:01] i mean everything fell
[1:32:05] when adam came home
[1:32:09] and met his wife
[1:32:14] do you know that adam never said what
[1:32:16] have you done
[1:32:22] eve how can you do this
[1:32:28] praise the lord
[1:32:31] as soon as he got home he just embraced
[1:32:34] her
[1:32:37] the truth is that adam never had
[1:32:40] no option he never knew of another woman
[1:32:45] that he could get marital so he can let
[1:32:47] this one go
[1:32:54] because all the things in in in
[1:32:57] in in in in the divorce court or the
[1:32:59] divorce
[1:33:00] mind is because
[1:33:03] we we have other options i don't never
[1:33:07] have
[1:33:07] another option
[1:33:10] when he came home he never blamed his
[1:33:12] wife
[1:33:15] he just embraced her his love
[1:33:18] never changed
[1:33:26] do you believe that
[1:33:30] can you believe it
[1:33:33] that his love never changed
[1:33:42] he never talked for a second to to to uh
[1:33:45] to to to investigate
[1:33:56] now you have to realize that eid fell
[1:33:59] from grace
[1:34:03] she fell from grace she was she was
[1:34:05] feeling
[1:34:06] condemnation feeling something that she
[1:34:08] had never felt before
[1:34:10] and adam was still in this state of
[1:34:16] innocence
[1:34:18] oh praise the lord
[1:34:22] oh my you think about that
[1:34:26] it's your law for this sinful stinking
[1:34:29] word
[1:34:30] that you were born in do you have love
[1:34:33] do you love them enough to forfeit your
[1:34:35] life
[1:34:35] do you love them enough to take their
[1:34:39] place
[1:34:41] to bear their sin
[1:34:47] to the highest crew of
[1:34:51] death now you you all of these things
[1:34:54] was what was taking place in one hour
[1:34:58] all of these things were the toss that
[1:35:00] was going through his mind

[1:35:34] lonely
[1:35:37] we create our own loneliness when we
[1:35:40] have no reason to be lonely
[1:35:43] because of selfish reason
[1:35:46] our selfishness is eating us up
[1:35:50] and we think it's somebody that is
[1:35:52] making us to feel lonely
[1:36:00] there could be nothing died that kind of
[1:36:03] death
[1:36:05] but him in that conference

[1:36:12] dropped from his brow
[1:36:17] he was under a strain the sins of the
[1:36:20] world was upon him
[1:36:23] and then he looked into the face of the
[1:36:26] dolph
[1:36:28] and said

[1:36:40] but now

[1:37:41] more i'm a liar
[1:37:44] but i will stop it today
[1:37:48] i'm a fire person but in this
[1:37:51] conference this evening i look into your
[1:37:55] face
[1:37:58] and take like my master who died for me
[1:38:02] to make my way clear not my will
[1:38:08] your will if it cost me my home
[1:38:13] if it cost me my husband my wife
[1:38:18] my father my mother my
[1:38:21] fellowship my church membership
[1:38:24] whatever it cost me
[1:38:28] in this conference
[1:38:32] i want to say i say i want
[1:38:37] your holy spirit in my life
[1:38:41] i have heard about it i want you
[1:38:44] in me not mine but yours
[1:38:47] that's my decision musicians you can
[1:38:50] come tonight
[1:38:54] god has called a place
[1:38:58] not upon some high pinnacle place
[1:39:01] but a humble little tabernacle
[1:39:05] about to fall you are having
[1:39:10] a conference
[1:39:20] praise the lord
[1:39:30] now we can have another time and talk
[1:39:34] about one hour with the beast
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:42] but you think about it
[1:39:46] this man these leaders
[1:39:49] they had to sell their right
[1:39:54] knowing that they don't have a they
[1:39:56] don't have a kingdom
[1:40:00] they're going to take the title of a
[1:40:02] king
[1:40:03] to be detected just to do the bidding
[1:40:08] of a deceiver
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:15] what if i choose i said well okay i i
[1:40:18] have to protect my
[1:40:20] my interest in this in this church
[1:40:22] [Music]
[1:40:24] and i got to talk to brother dan bernan
[1:40:26] are you really are you guy you're going
[1:40:28] to stick with me
[1:40:30] i'll make you the the assistant pastor
[1:40:34] i called brother jordan and said hey
[1:40:36] brother jordan i really need to have a
[1:40:38] talk with you
[1:40:41] all just because of my interests
[1:40:46] this man did not high kingdom
[1:40:52] but they were going to do the building
[1:40:54] of the beast
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:58] and he made them kings
[1:41:02] and whatever the beast said that's what
[1:41:05] they had to do
[1:41:06] because that was the agreed agreement
[1:41:15] but think about this other story
[1:41:18] that the scripture says he had made our
[1:41:20] kingdom priests unto our god
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:28] we gain our kingship by birth
[1:41:32] because our father is a king
[1:41:35] and when we gather near birth we are
[1:41:38] born
[1:41:38] as prince and princess and as we grow
[1:41:42] into the kingdom
[1:41:44] we can exercise the right as a king
[1:41:49] we don't have to do a bathing just
[1:41:52] to be able to be in good terms with a
[1:41:54] person
[1:41:56] and we can take a title on ourself
[1:42:00] but it comes as a birth
[1:42:03] we are willing to strive for the kingdom
[1:42:06] we are willing to do
[1:42:08] the bidding of the king
[1:42:14] we are not seeking athlete interests
[1:42:17] and fleshly interests and man-made
[1:42:20] interests
[1:42:22] we are seeking the bidding of the king
[1:42:24] not my will
[1:42:26] but that i be done
[1:42:40] you think about it tonight while we go
[1:42:42] to the lord in prayer
[1:42:49] i don't know where you are
[1:42:53] but i know that god
[1:42:56] i have been dealing with your heart
[1:42:57] about something
[1:43:01] it's been over a day it has been over a
[1:43:03] month it's been over a week
[1:43:05] it's more than an hour
[1:43:17] change my heart oh god
[1:43:36] oh
[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:48] yes change my heart
[1:43:58] make it ever true
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:14] may i be like you
[1:44:18] let's just sing that one more time
[1:44:21] change my
[1:44:23] change my life
[1:44:37] change my life oh god
[1:44:45] may i be
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:45:14] me
[1:45:17] this is what i press
[1:45:24] change my heart oh
[1:45:33] make it ever true
[1:45:40] change my heart
[1:45:48] may i be like
[1:45:51] why the musician plays softly listen to
[1:45:54] me
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:45:56] in the message rejected king brother
[1:45:58] branham says because
[1:45:59] saul will not list him because he will
[1:46:03] not listen to the voice
[1:46:05] of samuel the prophet
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:09] because he will not list him
[1:46:14] god turned him over
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:20] to an evil spirit
[1:46:31] and that evil spirit was a stubborn
[1:46:33] spirit
[1:46:37] because he would not list him god turned
[1:46:39] him over
[1:46:40] to an evil spirit
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:48] and all saul wanted to do was just to
[1:46:50] please himself
[1:46:53] all he sought to do
[1:46:57] is to please himself
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:03] no matter how much the word of god was
[1:47:05] preached to him
[1:47:07] no matter how much some your talk
[1:47:10] you can never listen
[1:47:17] young people the stubborn spirit is a
[1:47:19] destructive spirit
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:29] it's a destructive spirit but a man that
[1:47:32] is possessed with that can
[1:47:33] never see what he's doing is wrong
[1:47:41] the individual that is possessed with
[1:47:43] them
[1:47:43] [Music]
[1:47:45] is just all about himself
[1:47:52] everybody is wrong nobody can understand
[1:47:54] me
[1:47:55] it is just all about themself is because
[1:47:59] when god spoke to your heart the first
[1:48:01] time
[1:48:03] and you reject the voice of god
[1:48:06] you can play all the religions sing like
[1:48:09] an
[1:48:09] angel dress like a sin
[1:48:15] but your heart is stubborn you rebel
[1:48:19] [Music]
[1:48:29] and it was that spirit a lay saw to his
[1:48:32] own death
[1:48:35] that spirit led him from one era to
[1:48:38] another era to another era
[1:48:40] to another era to another era until it
[1:48:44] killed him
[1:48:46] until he died
[1:48:49] because he rejected the voice of god
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:26] so
[1:49:28] a stubborn spirit is a religious spirit
[1:49:33] [Music]
[1:49:37] it's a religious spirit
[1:49:40] it's so convincing
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:47] but it's all about pleasing
[1:49:51] you you are so
[1:49:56] interested in pleasing yourself
[1:49:59] that you cannot lay down your life for
[1:50:02] god's command
[1:50:14] one hour our lord jesus had to fight his
[1:50:17] own will
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:20] he said no lord no all the opportunity
[1:50:25] was coming to his mind
[1:50:27] everything that he could have become in
[1:50:29] this world
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:52] because he reject he rejected the the
[1:50:55] word of god
[1:50:56] it came just by on advise samuel just
[1:51:00] gave him an advice
[1:51:01] wait for me wait for me
[1:51:06] impatient
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:18] attitude
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:41] and because his heart was in that
[1:51:43] rebellious place
[1:51:44] god could not deal with his heart he
[1:51:47] could never
[1:51:48] feel sorry he could never say sorry
[1:51:51] no matter how many javelin he threw at
[1:51:54] david
[1:51:54] he could never say sorry he justified
[1:51:57] himself for everything that he did
[1:52:02] [Music]
[1:52:05] could never come to repentance
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:13] but think about this now think about
[1:52:15] this
[1:52:16] saul was not lost
[1:52:19] but that spirit tormented him
[1:52:26] he could never find joy he could never
[1:52:29] he could never get to the place of
[1:52:31] fullness
[1:52:35] he went from one trouble to another
[1:52:37] troubling
[1:52:38] and i mean he was just he was just so
[1:52:40] tore up
[1:52:47] [Music]
[1:52:49] moses never needed one hour he just
[1:52:52] needed five minutes in the presence of
[1:52:56] god
[1:52:59] and i don't know whether
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:06] and moses is here tonight
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:14] someone i really want to get a hold of
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:24] god

[1:53:35] let's pray together
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:54:00] and if you feel in your heart tonight
[1:54:06] you need help there is enough help in
