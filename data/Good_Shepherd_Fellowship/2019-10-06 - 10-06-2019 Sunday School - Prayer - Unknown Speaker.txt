========================================

so very much Oh God for being our defense and for being a shield unto us we thank you dear Lord Jesus for supplying us all i need's a cording to thy riches in glory we are so grateful dear Lord Jesus for haven't cast the hedge around us as you did unto you that we are living miracles and sometimes we don't even realize it Lord we thank you so much dear Lord Jesus for how far you have brought us but it is purely by your grace that we stand where we are and father tonight this afternoon this morning we give you the glory o God we give you the owner and we praise thee dear Lord Jesus Lord I have done for us even for bringing us to get a father on a beautiful Sunday morning like this for the first time in the week father I'm seeing the Sun Rise and it is so far that we pray to this morning let us Sun of righteousness father o God arise in our hearts this morning Oh God may you lift us up lift us up by a mighty right hand Lord and place that's where we ought to be and let the beauty of Christ shine in our life this arm of father we ask in Jesus name as we continue to look at our topic prayer be with us Lord and see us true in Jesus name praise be to God so we are still looking we just revising week number two week number two looking at prayer over again but as I said last week maybe this would take us maybe a few Sunday mornings I don't know how long but it wouldn't take us much because there is something I have on my heart I don't know how things are going to go but if God grants us grace we'll be looking at it so for today I want us to look at Luke 11:1 again look 11:1 Luke 11:1 and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto Him Lord teach us to pray and as John also taught his disciples praise be to God Matthew 6:9 my t69 after this manner therefore pray and then the Lost prayer praise be to God after this manner therefore pray so we've been looking at this for quite some time now and now we are just going to go through it just look at a few things we've already spoken about trusting that God will give us a different perspective about some of these scriptures you have already seen now prayer is a channel of communication between us and God and it's a must it's not when you feel like it but it's a must that you keep this line of communication active at all times keep this channel of communication open at all times it does not matter the condition in which you find yourself let it be active never close it praise be to God now God has not limited us we do not have a flaw being given limited access to the throne of God and we should not limit ourselves I know some religious I just take it that the Muslims for one they pray five times in a day and they have specific times that they can go before they are God but it is most with us Christians you can go any time of day and God is happy to receive you praise be to God so do not limit yourself when Jesus cried on the cross with a loud voice and said it is finished when he cry when you read a book of Mark 15 38 when he gave up the ghost their Bible says the veil of the temple was rent in twain from top all the way to bottom God has given us unlimited access what used to be the prism of the high priest it's now for the sons and daughters of God when you read the book of Revelation the Bible says we are made kings and priests unto God kings and priests unto God we have the right to go into the inner cause of God any time of day on the inner condition and then and any number of times we want and God hears us do nothing that some people have more right to the throne of God than you do every child of God has equal access every child of God has equal access to the throne of God and don't think that you know how do I put it just to put it blunt if people can pray and see results what it means is that you can also pray and see results but as children of God as we have said time and again will she be sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit to know when God says no and not be disappointed a lot of the times that would come with some resentment some disappointments no you should be happy that our Heavenly Father who knows everything and who knows what is best for you is saying no I have seen a family that was so much journey to get a car they were praying because for them the sign of success is getting a car and a house is probably the same everyone and they've got a car and in less than six months their car an accident and all of them died you should be sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit to know when God says yes and when God says no it doesn't make any difference praise be to God so learn to cry before him constantly constantly you know naturally I have seen excuse me a child that has been stopped almost to death why because their child is a good child the parent will tell you oh I saw this child this child is a good child and you asked why Oh he or she doesn't cry until they are hungry or on to something and because of that they look at a child stuff but it is not the same with a child that knows how to cry if you have a baby that knows how to cry they got everything they want praise be to God their baby that can cry they get everything they want and sometimes they even get more than they need because their baby is full there's nothing wrong with the baby and yet he will lie and I start crying and then you come and you're petting him just patting him and he's enjoying it you put him down he starts crying you have to pick him up again they get everything you want and that is the way we should be praying to our Father in heaven cry to him constantly sometimes you see a baby so wet and hungry and a bi mát I will tell you oh this baby is good standing this step because the baby is good you start the baby is better the baby knows how to cry and sometimes babies can be mean they will wait when you are doing your 12 hours you come from wake and you are so tired and then you go to bed and as soon as you begin to snore then you start and then you jump up from bedroom window where you are you pick them up just they enjoy it and sometimes we get so angry with the baby this baby they are troubling me yeah got you what you want by the good thing is that with our God is never troubled it doesn't matter how many times we cry to him he's never troubled he enjoys it he loves it when you come praise be to God lentil cry to God learn to cry out to God talk to God let prayer be a part of your life not only come to God when you feel like it let it be something that you love to do something that is cherished to do the idea I was just thinking about hoping didn't it what just came that probably you should have made this a year of prayer and he kept coming to me on and on and on and on I said no we started with prayer we end up with prayer whatever that meant of course a your prayer die would it mean after this we'll all pray again but you know there is a reason white you know things happen things don't just happen for the fun of it let's use this opportunity to get closer to God you know last week when I was talking about prayer I mentioned something I said [Music] living in the way it's very very important in our prayer life because you can live in the West so much till you live above the flesh and I said just envision yourself walking up the stairs with every single step you take in the Lord it just sends you above your egg and then brother one comes in and is preaching and he talks about when the aeroplane flies and it goes into the skies you don't even see the high scrapers anymore it's not as if they are not there they are dead but you don't see them just you know these are some of the things you suggest there is a where God confirms his word and these are things we shouldn't just let go without taking notice of them live in the world we can never stress that enough let the word of God be your absolute whatever you do whether you go to school what are you awake whether you do business even if you choose to not do anything and all you want to do is just eat and sleep let the Word of God be your absolute praise be to God just remember we are doing a revision and anything is not off the board so prayer the more you give yourself to prayer the more of self you lose and the more of God you came that is why the devil would always fight your prayer life because the more of God you get in the less the avenues for the devil to come when the devil is coming the double doesn't care how many times you go to the gym the devil doesn't care the muscles you have how big and tall you are the devil doesn't care about that you are no much no human being is a match for the devil the devil fears only 1/10 and that is the work that when God became a man and the devil came to him to tempt him they would have used any of his powers but he didn't he used the word he used nothing by the word let the word be your absolute don't look at enemy don't look at anybody we are supposed to encourage ourselves to provoke one another or to good ways that is good but beyond that that you can get to that point that if anybody is not going you would go because you are not looking across your shoulders to see who is coming and we snot coming and the song says do not goes with me yet I will go praise be to God let the weight be your absolute and remember the more you give yourself to prayer the less the more of God you are taking in and the more you lose yourself when you look at the disciples when they gathered in the upper room what else what did it with you of them waiting for the promise of God they were dead the Bible says they were in one Accord they were in one Accord and in prayer the more you pray the more you give yourself to prayer the more of God you get in the more of God you are taking and when the Holy Ghost came down oh that was a wonderful moment if God grant us grace there are a lot of peers who be looking at praise be to God our relationship with God must be one of prayer our relationship with God must be one of prayer from the foundation of the world God has always been worshipped it is our time today to bring him worship and if Christ Paris will be dead and gone and it will be the tale of the younger ones that are coming to step in and worship Him he would never lose a witness so he's always been worshipped and he would always be worshipped he deserves to be worshipped we don't wash it in when we are happy only when we are happy only when we get what we want only when things are good even when things are bad even when things do not good they will want it to go God so desire to be worshipped praise be to God God loves to be Washington he loves it as I was just talking about babies that crying those that those who don't crying God he loves this relationship so much that even one month strayed from the path of righteousness when sin came to the garden a man straight from their part of righteousness God being God knew what had happened in the garden but that didn't stop him the Bible said said he came down in the cool of the day to fellowship with Adam and Eve and when the fall took place God knew it that didn't stop God from coming down he's talking God does not fellowship with anything that is not his nature and when the sin came into the garden God still wanted to have fellowship with his children how to make a way out the Bible says without the shedding of blood there can never be forgiveness of sin God himself took a lamb and he offered a sacrifice on behalf of his children why so he could have this relationship with them despite the fall it was not the perfect way out but girls still wanted to have a relationship with his children made a way out sometimes when you stray from the part of righteousness you think like the only one that is losing that fellowship no God also loses that fellowship God can no wait to hear from you he can't wait to hear from you if you ever fall don't make that place your resting place that is not your resting place praise be to God God still me the way so his children can still come back to him so they can still have that communion they were having before praise be to God and this morning when I was just getting ready to come something just you know started coming in and I took a piece of paper and wrote them down now we have talked about this before as I said we're in a revision week so these are things we've been doing before if you are bored just forgive me that is what revision can do so in your prayer life never insists on your will never when the angel came to Mary these are the things I'll just writing down this morning when the angel came to Mary and I knows who Hey the birth of the Messiah she may have thought about it long and hard a virgin how is just I'm going to take this how are the people going to take this with anybody believe anything I tell them they may have Turan she may have thought of it long and hard and she said let it be done unto me according to your word in other ways not my will but let your will be done praise be to God now when Jesus came when he was born when his disciples asked him to teach them how to pray in the last prayer he said thy will thy will our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will and not only there when Jesus came to the end of his earthly ministry in the flesh when he came to the end and he foresaw what he was going to go through the Bible says he prayed and prayed and prayed and 80s that the sweat of his face started dropping like a cross of blood this is God Himself crying God in human flesh praying the way he prayed how hot we tend to pray and when he talked to the Father he said let this cup pass away let this cup pass away nevertheless not my will but your will be done praise be to God not my will but your will be done he may have thought of Mary when all the earth weigh against at the time and Mary could look at it and say let your will be done and he may have remembered the classes he had with his own disciples and told them anytime you pray don't insist on your will let the will of God be done and now here he finds himself praying and he saying let this cup pass away oh he may have thought of here it may have thought of me they said no not my will but your will be done that is how important it is our will would always lead us into trouble but a will of God would always bring us life when trials and temptations come your way I don't care how hard they are I don't care how buddy yeah I don't care the spokes you go through in this life one thing you must never do is to complain never complain never ask why why me why not you praise be to God why not you why should it be somebody else never ask why and never complain instead of you asking why and complaining you should always ask for one price vertical we are in a revision always ask for one and if you should ask for one thing what would you be asking for in terms of trial in times of tribulation in terms of education when life is not going well when the storms are against you when it looks like everybody has abandoned you while it looks like nobody cares about here and there is nobody to lean on never complain never ask God why while she D be asking always ask for great I feel great always ask for strength from God for he is ours as for wisdom not deadly wisdom but godly wisdom pray God to give you faith that you are going to go through the storm and that your faith in God would not waver and then when you have come to the end of that Jenny and you look back all you see is the grace of God praise be to God prayer prayer is the key and the song goes Jesus started with prayer and he ended with prayer prayer is a master key Freya can unlock every single door you have the master key in your head you can unlock every single door and again you can look every single door you can unlock every door and you can you can you can open you can lock that is what the key does so when the double opens any door you lock that door and any door that door and a daughter double closes or locks on you you open it praise be to God you have the key in your hand the Bible says that the weapon of our warfare the weapons of our warfare are not carnal they are mightier to the pulling down of strongholds praise be to God don't limit yourself God has not limited why should you limit yourself when you pray believe praise be to God it's amazing how the time can just catch up on us any time so yes Oh fifteen minutes break okay so it's time for the 15 minutes right we are going to pray if you have to use the restroom just keep whatever you're trusting God for believe that God would do it if the rod of Iran that was dry dry there was no life in it there was no life in it if in the presence of God that rod would blossom and not only that but bad fresh almonds think about it think about it you sons and daughters of God it pays to wait praise be to God shall we pray our Lord and our master Jesus we thank you so much for the period
