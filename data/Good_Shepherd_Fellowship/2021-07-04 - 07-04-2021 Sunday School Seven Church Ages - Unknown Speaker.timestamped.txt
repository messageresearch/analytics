[0:28] so
[0:39] introduction though this volume will
[0:42] concern itself with various major
[0:44] doctrines
[0:45] such as the godhead water baptism etc
[0:48] found in revelation chapters one through
[0:50] three its main theme is the setting
[0:52] forth of a detailed study of the seven
[0:54] church ages
[0:56] this is necessary in order to study and
[0:58] understand the rest of the revelation
[1:01] for out of the ages come the seals and
[1:04] out of the seals come the trumpets
[1:06] and out of the trumpets come the viles
[1:08] like the first burst of a roman candle
[1:11] the church ages come forth with a mighty
[1:13] initial illumination
[1:14] without which there could be no further
[1:16] light
[1:17] but once the brilliance of the seven
[1:19] church ages is given by divine
[1:21] revelation
[1:22] light upon light follows until the whole
[1:24] of the revelation
[1:25] opens wide before our wandering eyes and
[1:28] we edified and purified by its spirit
[1:31] are made ready for his glorious
[1:33] appearing even our lord and savior the
[1:36] one true
[1:36] god jesus christ this composition is set
[1:40] forth in the first person as it is a
[1:42] message from my heart to the hearts of
[1:44] the people
[1:46] particular pains have been taken to
[1:47] capitalize all names and titles
[1:50] nouns and pronouns etc that relate to
[1:52] godhead
[1:54] and also the words bible scripture and
[1:56] the word as we hold this only proper in
[1:59] speaking of the majesty and person of
[2:01] god and his holy word
[2:03] i pray the blessing of god upon each
[2:05] reader and may illumination by the
[2:08] spirit of god be each one special
[2:10] portion
[2:12] william marion branham
[2:15] chapter 1 the revelation of jesus the
[2:18] christ
[2:20] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[2:23] gave unto him
[2:24] to show unto his servants things which
[2:26] must shortly come to pass
[2:28] and he sent and signified it by his
[2:30] angel unto his servant john
[2:32] who bear record of the word of god and
[2:35] of the testimony of jesus christ and of
[2:37] all things that he saw
[2:41] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[2:43] hear the words of this prophecy
[2:45] and keep those things which are written
[2:47] therein for the time is at hand
[2:51] john to the seven churches which are in
[2:53] asia
[2:54] grace be unto you and peace from him
[2:57] which is and which was and which is to
[2:59] come
[3:00] and from the seven spirits which are
[3:02] before his throne
[3:04] and from jesus christ who is the
[3:06] faithful witness
[3:07] and the first begotten of the dead and
[3:10] the prince of the kings of the earth
[3:12] unto him that loved us and washed us
[3:14] from our sins in his own blood
[3:18] and have made us kings and priests unto
[3:20] god and his father
[3:22] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[3:24] ever
[3:25] amen behold he cometh with clouds
[3:29] and every eye shall see him and they
[3:31] also which pierced him
[3:33] and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
[3:35] because of him
[3:36] even so amen
[3:40] i am alpha and omega the beginning and
[3:43] the ending saith the lord which is and
[3:45] which
[3:46] was and which is to come the almighty
[3:50] i john who also am your brother and
[3:52] companion in tribulation
[3:54] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[3:56] christ was in the aisle that is called
[3:58] patmos for the word of god and for the
[4:01] testimony of jesus christ
[4:04] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[4:06] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[4:09] a trumpet
[4:11] saying i am alpha and omega the first
[4:14] and the last
[4:15] and what thou seest write in a book and
[4:18] send it unto the seven churches which
[4:19] are in asia
[4:21] unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto
[4:24] pergamos
[4:25] and unto thyatira and unto sardis and
[4:28] unto philadelphia
[4:30] and unto laodicea and i turned to see
[4:34] the voice that spake with me
[4:35] and being turned i saw seven golden
[4:38] candlesticks
[4:39] and in the midst of the seven
[4:40] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[4:43] man
[4:44] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[4:46] and gert about the paps with a golden
[4:48] girdle
[4:49] his head and his hairs were white like
[4:51] wool as white as snow
[4:53] and his eyes were as a flame of fire
[4:56] and his feet like unto fine brass as if
[4:59] they burned in a furnace
[5:01] and his voice as the sound of many
[5:03] waters
[5:05] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[5:08] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[5:09] two-edged sword
[5:11] and his countenance was as the sun
[5:12] shineth in his strength
[5:15] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[5:18] dead
[5:19] and he laid his right hand upon me
[5:21] saying unto me
[5:22] fear not i am the first and the last
[5:26] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[5:29] behold i am alive forevermore
[5:31] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[5:34] death
[5:36] write the things which thou hast seen
[5:38] and the things which are and the things
[5:40] which shall be hereafter
[5:42] the mystery of the seven stars which
[5:44] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[5:46] seven golden candlesticks
[5:48] the seven stars are the angels of the
[5:50] seven churches
[5:52] and the seven candlesticks which thou
[5:54] sawest are the seven
[5:56] churches
[6:01] introduction to chapter one revelation 1
[6:05] 1-3 the revelation of jesus christ which
[6:08] god gave unto him to shew unto his
[6:10] servants
[6:11] things which must shortly come to pass
[6:14] and he sent
[6:14] and signified it by his angel unto his
[6:16] servant john
[6:18] who bear record of the word of god and
[6:20] of the testimony of jesus christ
[6:22] and of all the things that he saw
[6:25] blessed is he that readeth
[6:27] and they that hear the words of this
[6:28] prophecy and keep those things which are
[6:30] written therein
[6:31] for the time is at hand the scribe
[6:35] not author of this book is saint john
[6:37] the divine
[6:38] historians agree that he lived the last
[6:40] part of his life in ephesus
[6:41] though at the time of the writing of
[6:42] this book he was on the isle of patmos
[6:46] it is not the life story of john but it
[6:48] is the revelation of jesus christ in the
[6:50] future church ages
[6:52] in verse 3 it is called a prophecy and
[6:55] that is actually what it is
[6:58] this book is usually termed the
[6:59] revelation of saint john but that is
[7:01] incorrect
[7:02] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[7:04] given to john for christians of
[7:06] all ages it is the only book in the
[7:09] entire bible that is written by jesus
[7:11] himself
[7:12] through personally appearing to a scribe
[7:15] it is the last book of the bible yet it
[7:17] tells the beginning and the end of the
[7:18] dispensations of the gospel
[7:21] now the greek word for revelation is
[7:23] apocalypse which means unveiling
[7:26] this unveiling is perfectly described in
[7:28] the example of a sculptor
[7:29] unveiling his work of statuary exposing
[7:32] it to the onlooker
[7:33] it is an uncovering revealing what was
[7:35] previously hidden
[7:37] now the uncovering is not only the
[7:39] revelation of the person of christ
[7:41] but it is the revelation of his future
[7:43] works in the oncoming seven
[7:45] church ages the importance of revelation
[7:48] by the spirit to a true believer can
[7:50] never be overemphasized
[7:52] revelation means more to you than
[7:54] perhaps you realize
[7:56] now i am not talking about this book of
[7:58] revelation and you
[7:59] i am talking about all revelation it is
[8:02] tremendously important to the church
[8:05] do you remember in matthew 16 where
[8:07] jesus asked the disciples this question
[8:10] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[8:13] and they said some say that thou art
[8:16] john the baptist
[8:17] some elias and others jeremias or one of
[8:20] the prophets
[8:21] he sayeth unto them but whom say ye that
[8:24] i am
[8:25] and simon peter answered and said thou
[8:27] art the christ
[8:28] the son of the living god and jesus
[8:31] answered and said unto him
[8:33] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[8:36] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[8:38] but my father which is in heaven
[8:40] and i say unto thee that thou art peter
[8:42] and upon this rock i will build my
[8:44] church
[8:45] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[8:47] against it
[8:49] the roman catholics say that the church
[8:51] is built upon peter
[8:52] now that is really carnal how could god
[8:55] build the church upon a man so unstable
[8:57] that he denied the lord jesus and cursed
[8:59] while doing it
[9:01] god can't build his church upon any man
[9:03] born in sin
[9:05] and it wasn't some rock lying there as
[9:07] though god had hallowed the ground at
[9:08] that spot
[9:10] and it isn't as the protestants say that
[9:12] the church is built upon jesus
[9:14] it was the revelation read it the way it
[9:17] is written
[9:18] flesh and blood hath not revealed it but
[9:21] my father hath revealed it
[9:23] and upon this rock revelation i will
[9:26] build my church
[9:27] the church is built on revelation on
[9:29] thee thus saith the lord
[9:32] how did abel know what to do in order to
[9:34] offer a proper sacrifice
[9:36] to god by faith he received the
[9:38] revelation of the blood
[9:40] cain didn't get such a revelation even
[9:43] though he had a commandment
[9:44] so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice
[9:47] it was a revelation from god that made
[9:49] the difference and gave abel eternal
[9:51] life
[9:52] now you might take what the pastor says
[9:54] or what the seminary teaches
[9:56] and though it might be taught to you
[9:57] with eloquence until god reveals to you
[10:00] that jesus
[10:00] is the christ and that it is the blood
[10:03] that cleanses
[10:04] you and that god is your savior you will
[10:06] never have eternal life
[10:08] it is the spiritual revelation that does
[10:10] it
[10:12] now i said that this book of revelation
[10:14] is the revelation of jesus
[10:15] and what he is doing in the churches for
[10:17] those seven ages
[10:19] it is a revelation because the disciples
[10:21] themselves
[10:22] didn't know these recorded truths it had
[10:24] not been previously revealed to them
[10:27] you remember that they came to jesus in
[10:29] the book of acts and asked him
[10:31] are you at this time going to restore
[10:33] the kingdom to israel
[10:34] and he said it is not for you to know
[10:37] the times or the seasons
[10:39] those men were still thinking of jesus
[10:41] having an earthly kingdom
[10:43] but it was a spiritual kingdom that he
[10:45] was going to build
[10:47] even he could not tell them about his
[10:48] place in it for the father had not
[10:50] revealed it unto him
[10:52] but now after his death and resurrection
[10:54] and at this particular time in his
[10:56] mediatorial ministry
[10:58] he is able to set forth here in this
[10:59] revelation of himself to john
[11:02] what his glory and presence in the
[11:03] church would mean and do
[11:06] in this revelation he tells us what the
[11:08] end of the devil
[11:09] is he tells us how he is going to deal
[11:12] with the devil and cast him into the
[11:13] lake of fire
[11:15] he reveals the end of the wicked ones
[11:16] who follow satan
[11:18] and satan hates that have you ever
[11:21] noticed how satan hates two books of the
[11:23] bible more than all others
[11:25] through liberal theologians and
[11:27] pseudoscientists he is always attacking
[11:29] the book of genesis
[11:30] and the book of revelation in both of
[11:33] these books we find satan's origin his
[11:35] awful ways and his destruction
[11:37] that is why he attacks them he hates to
[11:40] be exposed
[11:41] and in those books he is exposed for
[11:43] exactly what he is
[11:45] jesus said about satan he has no part in
[11:48] me and i have no part in him
[11:50] the devil would like to prove that
[11:52] different but he cannot
[11:54] so he does all he can to destroy
[11:56] confidence in the word
[11:58] but when the church disbelieves satan
[11:59] and believes the spirit's revelation of
[12:01] the word
[12:02] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[12:04] her
[12:05] let me just put in a word here from my
[12:07] own ministry if you don't mind
[12:09] you all know that this gift in my life
[12:11] is supernatural
[12:13] it is a gift whereby the holy spirit is
[12:15] able to discern diseases
[12:16] and the thoughts of men's hearts and
[12:18] other hidden things that only god could
[12:20] know and then reveal to me
[12:23] i wish you could stand with me and see
[12:24] the faces of people when satan knows he
[12:26] is going to be exposed
[12:29] now it isn't the people that i am
[12:30] talking about it is that satan has got a
[12:33] hold in their lives through sin
[12:35] indifference and disease but you should
[12:37] see their faces
[12:39] satan knows he is going to be exposed
[12:41] and the most peculiar changes come over
[12:43] the people's countenances
[12:45] satan is afraid he knows that the spirit
[12:48] of god
[12:48] is about to let the people know of his
[12:50] works that is why he hates these
[12:52] meetings so much
[12:54] when names are called and diseases
[12:56] revealed satan hates it
[12:58] now what is this it is not mind reading
[13:01] it is not telepathy nor
[13:02] is it witchcraft it is a revelation by
[13:05] the holy ghost
[13:06] that is the only way i can know it of
[13:09] course the carnal mind will call it
[13:10] anything but the holy ghost
[13:14] let me show you another reason why satan
[13:16] hates this book of the revelation of
[13:18] jesus christ in the church
[13:20] he knows that jesus christ is the same
[13:22] yesterday and today and forever
[13:24] and he changes not he knows that a whole
[13:26] lot more than do 90
[13:28] of the theologians he knows that since
[13:30] god is immutable in his nature
[13:32] then he is just as immutable in his ways
[13:35] thus satan knows assuredly that the
[13:37] original church at pentecost with the
[13:39] power of god
[13:40] mark 16 in action is the true church
[13:43] that jesus claims as his own
[13:45] all else is false it has to be
[13:49] now remember this christ in the true
[13:51] church is a continuation of the book of
[13:53] acts
[13:54] but the book of revelation shows how
[13:56] that the antichrist spirit would come
[13:58] into the church and defile it
[14:00] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[14:03] it exposes satan revealing his works
[14:06] attempted destruction of god's people
[14:08] and the discrediting of god's word
[14:10] right down to the time he has cast into
[14:12] the lake of fire
[14:13] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[14:16] knows that if the people get the true
[14:18] revelation of the true
[14:19] church and what she is what she stands
[14:22] for
[14:22] and that she can do the greater works
[14:25] she will be an invincible
[14:26] army if they get a true revelation of
[14:29] the two spirits within the framework of
[14:31] the christian church
[14:32] and by god's spirit discern and
[14:34] withstand the antichrist spirit
[14:36] satan will be powerless before her he
[14:39] will be as definitely thwarted today as
[14:41] when christ withstood his every effort
[14:42] to gain power over him in the desert
[14:45] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[14:48] it
[14:48] with true revelation in our lives the
[14:50] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[14:52] but we will prevail over them
[14:56] you will recall that i mentioned at the
[14:57] beginning of this message
[14:59] that this book we are studying is the
[15:00] actual revelation of jesus himself in
[15:03] the church
[15:04] and his work in the future ages then i
[15:07] mentioned that it takes the holy spirit
[15:09] to give us revelation or we will fail to
[15:11] get it
[15:12] bringing these two thoughts together you
[15:14] will see that it won't take just
[15:16] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[15:18] book real
[15:19] it is going to take the operation of the
[15:20] holy ghost
[15:22] that means this book can't be revealed
[15:24] to anyone but a special class of people
[15:27] it will take one with prophetic insight
[15:30] it will require the ability to hear from
[15:32] god
[15:33] it will require supernatural instruction
[15:35] not just a student comparing verse with
[15:37] verse though that is good but a mystery
[15:40] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[15:42] it never becomes clear
[15:44] how we need to hear from god and lay
[15:46] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[15:48] spirit to hear and know
[15:51] as i have already said this book
[15:53] revelation
[15:54] is the consummation of the scriptures it
[15:57] is even placed exactly right in the
[15:59] canon of scripture
[16:00] at the end now you can know why it says
[16:03] that anyone who reads or even hears it
[16:05] is blessed
[16:06] it is the revelation of god that will
[16:08] give you authority over the devil
[16:10] and you can see why they who would add
[16:12] or take from it would be cursed
[16:15] it would have to be so for who can add
[16:17] or take away from the perfect revelation
[16:19] of god and overcome the enemy
[16:21] it is that simple there is nothing of
[16:23] such prevailing power as the revelation
[16:25] of the word
[16:27] see in verse 3 a blessing is pronounced
[16:29] on those who give special attention to
[16:31] this book
[16:32] i think this refers to the old testament
[16:34] custom of the priests
[16:36] reading the word to the congregation in
[16:38] the morning you see many could not read
[16:40] so the priest had to read to them
[16:42] as long as it was the word the blessing
[16:44] was there it didn't matter if it was
[16:46] read or heard
[16:48] the time is at hand the time was not at
[16:52] hand previously
[16:53] in the wisdom and economy of god this
[16:55] mighty revelation
[16:56] though fully known to god could not come
[16:59] forth hitherto
[17:00] thus we immediately learn a principle
[17:03] the revelation
[17:04] of god for each age can come in that age
[17:06] only and at a specific time
[17:09] look at the history of israel the
[17:11] revelation of god to moses came only at
[17:13] a specific time in history
[17:15] and even more specifically it came as
[17:17] the people cried unto god
[17:19] jesus himself came at the fullness of
[17:22] time
[17:22] he being the complete revelation of the
[17:24] godhead and in this
[17:26] age laodicean the revelation of god will
[17:29] come in its due time
[17:31] it will not falter neither will it be
[17:33] premature
[17:34] think on this and heed it well for we
[17:37] are in the end time today
[17:40] the salutation revelation 1
[17:43] 4-6 john to the seven churches which are
[17:47] in asia
[17:48] grace be unto you and peace from him
[17:50] which is and which was and which is to
[17:53] come
[17:53] and from the seven spirits which are
[17:55] before his throne
[17:57] and from jesus christ who is the
[17:59] faithful witness
[18:00] and the first begotten of the dead and
[18:02] the prince of the kings of the earth
[18:04] unto him that loved us and washed us
[18:06] from our sins in his own blood
[18:08] and have made us kings and priests unto
[18:10] god and his father
[18:12] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[18:14] ever amen
[18:17] the word asia is actually asia minor
[18:20] it is a small parcel of land about the
[18:21] size of indiana
[18:23] the seven churches there were especially
[18:25] picked from all other churches for their
[18:27] characteristics
[18:28] which same characteristics would be
[18:30] found in the successive ages centuries
[18:31] later
[18:33] the seven spirits before the throne is
[18:35] the spirit that was in each of the seven
[18:37] messengers
[18:38] giving them their ministries for the age
[18:40] in which each lived
[18:42] now all these expressions him which is
[18:45] and
[18:46] him which was and is to come and
[18:48] faithful witness
[18:50] and firstborn from among the dead and
[18:53] prince of the kings of the earth and the
[18:55] alpha and omega
[18:57] and the almighty are titles and
[18:59] descriptions of the one and the same
[19:01] person
[19:02] who is the lord jesus christ who washed
[19:04] us from our sins in his own blood
[19:08] the spirit of god in john expresses
[19:10] thusly in order to set forth the supreme
[19:12] deity of jesus christ
[19:14] and to reveal the godhead as one god
[19:17] today there is a gross error it is that
[19:20] there are three gods instead of one
[19:22] this revelation as given to john by
[19:24] jesus himself corrects that error
[19:27] it is not that there are three gods but
[19:29] one god with three offices
[19:32] there is one god with three titles
[19:34] father
[19:35] son and holy ghost this mighty
[19:38] revelation is what the early church had
[19:40] and it must be restored in this last day
[19:42] along with the correct formula of water
[19:44] baptism
[19:46] now modern theologians won't agree with
[19:48] me for here is what was written in a
[19:50] great christian magazine
[19:52] that teaching on the trinity is at the
[19:54] very heart and core of the old testament
[19:57] it is every wit as much at the heart and
[19:59] core of the new testament
[20:01] the new testament is just as much
[20:03] opposed as the old testament is
[20:05] to the thought that there are more gods
[20:07] than one
[20:08] yet the new testament with equal
[20:09] clearness teaches that the father is god
[20:12] and the son
[20:13] is god and the holy spirit is god and
[20:15] that these three
[20:16] are not three aspects of the same person
[20:19] but three persons standing in a truly
[20:21] personal relationship to one another
[20:24] there we have the great doctrine of the
[20:25] three persons but one god
[20:28] they also state god according to the
[20:31] bible is not just one person
[20:33] but he is three persons in one god that
[20:36] is the great mystery of the trinity
[20:38] it sure is how can three persons be in
[20:41] one god
[20:43] not only is there no bible for it but it
[20:45] shows even a lack of intelligent
[20:46] reasoning three distinct persons
[20:49] though identical substance make three
[20:51] gods or language has lost its meaning
[20:54] entirely
[20:55] just listen to these words again i am
[20:58] alpha and omega
[20:59] the beginning and the ending saith the
[21:01] lord which is and which was and which is
[21:04] to come
[21:05] the almighty this is deity
[21:08] this is not simply a prophet a man this
[21:12] is god
[21:13] and it is not a revelation of three gods
[21:15] but of one god
[21:16] the almighty they didn't believe in
[21:19] three gods in the beginning of the
[21:21] church
[21:22] you can't find that sort of belief
[21:23] amongst the apostles
[21:25] it was after the apostolic age that this
[21:27] theory came in and really became an
[21:29] issue and a cardinal doctrine at the
[21:31] nicene council
[21:33] the doctrine of godhead caused a two-way
[21:35] split at nicaea
[21:36] and from that split there came two
[21:38] extremes one actually went into
[21:40] polytheism believing in three gods
[21:43] and the others went into unitarianism of
[21:46] course that was a little while in coming
[21:48] about
[21:48] but it did and we have it right today
[21:52] but the revelation through john by the
[21:54] spirit to the churches was
[21:56] i am the lord jesus christ and i am all
[21:58] of it
[21:59] there isn't any other god and he put his
[22:02] seal on this revelation
[22:05] consider this who was the father of
[22:07] jesus
[22:08] matthew 1 18 says she was
[22:12] found with child of the holy ghost
[22:15] but jesus himself claimed that god was
[22:17] his father
[22:18] god the father and god the holy ghost as
[22:20] we often express these terms
[22:22] make the father and the spirit one
[22:24] indeed they are or else jesus had two
[22:27] fathers
[22:28] but notice that jesus said that he and
[22:30] his father were one
[22:31] not two that makes one god
[22:35] since this is historically and
[22:37] scripturally true people wonder where
[22:39] the three came from
[22:41] it became a foundational doctrine at the
[22:43] nicene council in 325 a.d
[22:46] this trinity an absolutely unscriptural
[22:49] word
[22:49] was based upon the many gods of rome the
[22:52] romans had many gods to whom they prayed
[22:55] they also prayed to ancestors as
[22:57] mediators it was just a step to give new
[22:59] names to old gods
[23:01] so we have saints to make it more
[23:03] biblical thus instead of jupiter venice
[23:06] mars etc
[23:07] we have paul peter fatima christopher
[23:10] etc etc
[23:12] they could not make their pagan religion
[23:13] work out with just one god
[23:15] so they split him up into three and they
[23:18] made intercessors of the saints as they
[23:20] had made intercessors of their ancestors
[23:24] ever since then people have failed to
[23:25] realize that there is just one god with
[23:28] three offices or manifestations
[23:30] they know there is one god according to
[23:32] scripture but they try to make it the
[23:34] fantastic theory that god
[23:36] is like a bunch of grapes three persons
[23:38] with the same divinity shared equally by
[23:40] all
[23:41] but it plainly says here in revelation
[23:43] that jesus is
[23:45] that which is that which was and
[23:48] that which is to come he is the alpha
[23:51] and omega
[23:52] which means that he is the a to z or the
[23:55] all of it he is everything the almighty
[23:59] he is the rose of sharon the lily of the
[24:01] valley the bright and morning star
[24:04] the righteous branch the father the son
[24:07] and the holy ghost he is god almighty
[24:10] god
[24:11] one god first timothy 3 16
[24:16] says and without controversy great is
[24:19] the mystery of godliness
[24:20] god was manifest in the flesh justified
[24:23] in the spirit
[24:24] seen of angels preached unto the
[24:26] gentiles
[24:27] believed on in the world received up
[24:29] into glory
[24:31] this is what the bible says it doesn't
[24:33] say a thing about a first or second or
[24:35] third person here
[24:37] it says god was manifest in flesh one
[24:40] god
[24:41] that one god was manifested in flesh
[24:44] that ought to settle it god came in a
[24:46] human form
[24:48] that didn't make him another god he was
[24:50] god
[24:51] the same god it was a revelation then
[24:54] and it is a revelation now one god
[24:59] let's go back in the bible and see what
[25:01] he was in the beginning according to the
[25:02] revelation he gave of himself
[25:05] the great jehovah appeared to israel in
[25:07] a pillar of fire
[25:08] as the angel of the covenant he lived in
[25:10] that pillar of fire and led israel daily
[25:13] at the temple he announced his coming
[25:15] with a great cloud
[25:17] then one day he was manifested in a
[25:19] virgin-born body that was prepared for
[25:21] him
[25:22] the god that tabernacled above the tents
[25:24] of israel now took on himself a tent of
[25:26] flesh
[25:27] and tabernacled as a man amongst men but
[25:30] he was the same
[25:31] god the bible teaches that god was in
[25:34] christ
[25:35] the body was jesus in him dwelt all the
[25:39] fullness of the godhead
[25:40] bodily nothing can be plainer than that
[25:43] mystery yes but actual truth
[25:46] it can't be plainer so if he wasn't
[25:49] three people then he can't be
[25:51] three now one god and this same god was
[25:55] made flesh
[25:57] jesus said i came from god and i go back
[26:00] to god
[26:01] john 16 27-28
[26:05] that is exactly what happened he
[26:07] disappeared from earth by way of his
[26:09] death burial resurrection and ascension
[26:12] then paul met him on the road to
[26:13] damascus and he spoke to paul and said
[26:16] saul saul why persecutest thou me
[26:20] paul said who art thou lord he said i am
[26:24] jesus
[26:25] he was a pillar of fire a blinding light
[26:28] he had turned back exactly as he said he
[26:30] would
[26:30] back to the same form that he was before
[26:33] he took on a tabernacle of flesh
[26:36] that is exactly how john saw it john 1
[26:39] 18 no man hath seen god at any time
[26:43] the only begotten son which is in the
[26:45] bosom of the father
[26:47] he hath declared him notice where john
[26:50] says that jesus
[26:51] is he is in the bosom of the father
[26:55] luke 2 11 says for unto you is born this
[26:59] day in the city of david a savior which
[27:01] is christ the lord
[27:03] he was born the christ and eight days
[27:05] later when he was circumcised he was
[27:07] named jesus even as the angel had told
[27:09] them
[27:10] i was born a branham when i was born
[27:13] they gave me the name of william
[27:15] he was christ but he was given a name
[27:17] down here among men
[27:19] that outward tabernacle men could see
[27:21] was called jesus
[27:23] he was the lord of glory the almighty
[27:25] manifested in flesh
[27:27] he is god the father son and holy ghost
[27:30] he is all that father son and holy ghost
[27:34] are just titles
[27:35] they are not names that is why we
[27:38] baptize in the name of the lord jesus
[27:40] christ
[27:41] for that is a name not a title it is the
[27:44] name of those titles just like you take
[27:46] a newborn baby who is a son and name him
[27:49] baby is what it is son is the title
[27:52] then you name him john henry brown
[27:55] you just don't baptize in jesus name
[27:58] there are thousands of jesus in the
[28:00] world and have been even before
[28:01] jesus our savior but there is only one
[28:04] of them born the christ
[28:06] lord jesus christ
[28:20] [Music]
[28:44] you
