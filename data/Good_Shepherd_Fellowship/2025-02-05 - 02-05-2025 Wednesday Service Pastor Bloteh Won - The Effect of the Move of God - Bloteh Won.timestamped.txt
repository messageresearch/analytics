[52:43] and be able to support them praise the
[52:46] Lord so tonight I want to speak on on uh
[52:50] a little thought that being on my mind
[52:52] for the while uh that I that I title the
[52:56] effect of the move of
[52:58] God the effect of the move of God praise
[53:03] the Lord just like the Bible says in
[53:06] Genesis chapter one and uh uh the spirit
[53:10] of God
[53:12] mov that was the first time that uh the
[53:16] great intent of God that was the first
[53:19] time Elohim we move out of the space of
[53:23] being the great innal spirit you have to
[53:26] know being the great eternal spirit he
[53:28] fill all time and all
[53:31] space and uh but uh that that that God
[53:36] will
[53:37] will will create a beginning for himself
[53:42] that God that the great internal Spirit
[53:44] the great Elohim will have a beginning
[53:48] for himself which mean he
[53:51] condescended God condemns himself and
[53:54] then he condescended he he had to put
[53:57] all his great internal power in himself
[54:01] to form a body and then drop down out of
[54:05] uh eternity to time praise the Lord and
[54:09] when he dropped down uh then that that
[54:14] great interal spirit that was filling
[54:16] all time y said now he had enough space
[54:20] because he have cond he had condensed
[54:23] himself and then the Bible say he
[54:26] started
[54:28] moving and I mean he was moving all over
[54:31] the place all over the place God was
[54:33] moving amen the Bible says the spirit of
[54:36] God move he moved upon the spirit of God
[54:41] mov upon the face of the water amen the
[54:45] spirit of God moved in that darkness and
[54:48] in that chaos thou was the first move of
[54:53] God praise the Lord because we will
[54:57] learn and and and and realize that
[54:59] brother brandham called every Revival a
[55:02] move of God that's what a Revival is
[55:05] amen a Revival is a move of God so this
[55:09] is the first move of God and when God
[55:13] moved in the beginning uh uh uh uh there
[55:17] was an effect of his move praise the
[55:20] Lord the Bible says and the spirit of
[55:23] God move upon the face of the
[55:26] water and God said let there be light
[55:30] and there was light
[55:32] amen the spirit moved and God spoke
[55:36] behind the spirit and the spirit brought
[55:38] to pass exactly what God
[55:41] Said praise the Lord and we saw that
[55:45] that uh that uh effect of that move of
[55:48] God as you look as you go down and and
[55:51] and and there was light and and God saw
[55:54] that the light was good and and and and
[55:56] the spirit of God uh separated the water
[55:59] from the land what a move what a great
[56:02] move of God praise the Lord amen and and
[56:06] what happened in the first move of God
[56:10] happened in every move of
[56:12] God praise the Lord amen every time God
[56:16] move he brings a message when he move in
[56:20] the first time he said let there be
[56:22] light amen every time God move he bring
[56:25] a message and every time the message go
[56:28] forth it cause a separation just like it
[56:31] was in Eden it separated the water from
[56:34] the land it separated the day from from
[56:36] the night there was a separation and
[56:39] every time uh uh uh uh the spirit of God
[56:42] move it brings out the seeds that was in
[56:45] the Earth let every seed uh uh uh bring
[56:48] forth of its
[56:50] kind are we together praise the Lord
[56:54] like I said we just trying to in
[56:56] introduce this thought and and layer
[56:57] Foundation year so uh I hope I can be
[57:00] able to to help you to fall into the
[57:03] same channel where I am now so we see
[57:07] that in every move of God there is there
[57:11] is an there there is an effect whenever
[57:13] the spirit of God move whenever God move
[57:17] and uh and and and and and and that's
[57:20] the reason why we are here tonight you
[57:22] know I mean it's just now to have
[57:24] another religious SE
[57:26] but is also to be affected by the move
[57:29] of God because we believe there is a
[57:31] move of God in our day amen there is a
[57:34] move of God in our day when God
[57:36] condescended and he moved he never
[57:39] stopped praise the Lord he kept
[57:43] moving you'll never read one place where
[57:45] the Bible says and the spirit of the law
[57:49] stopped the spirit of God moved and it
[57:52] kept moving and is moving today
[57:57] praise the Lord it keep moving and is
[58:00] moving today now because tonight is a
[58:03] Wednesday night and we not like want to
[58:05] keep you a whole lot we will just will
[58:07] just hold one familiar code that we all
[58:11] uh uh uh very acquainted with we will
[58:14] that's what we will deal with tonight
[58:15] and then uh on Sunday we'll be able to
[58:18] go into more details of what we what we
[58:21] want to share with
[58:24] you that is the the Ephesian Church
[58:27] age I read this before and I believe you
[58:31] have heard it before I believe you have
[58:33] read it before but we want to just look
[58:35] at that together praise the Lord
[58:40] amen now this particular thought has
[58:43] been has been on my mind uh uh for for
[58:47] some time now I've been kind of for
[58:50] looking at it amen I've been kind of for
[58:54] looking at it and and really wanted to
[58:56] to to speak on it and uh and bring it to
[58:59] you in in a way that uh uh we'll be able
[59:03] to
[59:04] appreciate praise the
[59:07] Lord now so uh uh uh brother brandom
[59:10] said here have you ever
[59:14] studied the history of
[59:16] Revival
[59:18] amen so Revival has a
[59:22] history and just like I said uh uh Earth
[59:26] this this space was
[59:29] experiencing its first
[59:32] Revival praise the Lord amen it was
[59:36] experiencing its first Revival and that
[59:39] Revival was the move of
[59:42] God are we
[59:46] together so if we are going to look at
[59:49] the history of
[59:51] Revival and the the the the the Revival
[59:54] that we going to look at
[59:56] is every time that God move in
[59:59] history that's what we going to look at
[1:00:02] so uh tonight we going back right from
[1:00:05] the first move of God which is there in
[1:00:07] Genesis chapter one and we want to look
[1:00:10] at the positive effect and also the
[1:00:13] negative
[1:00:15] effect because there is a negative
[1:00:19] effect and if we are in a move of God
[1:00:23] that we that that we call the message of
[1:00:25] the hour which is uh uh according to
[1:00:28] scripture is uh uh the message to the
[1:00:31] seven Church ages and uh the the one
[1:00:34] that was moving in the midst of the
[1:00:36] seven golden Candlestick is it's still
[1:00:39] moving today is is uh there that's the
[1:00:41] message that we are honored that's what
[1:00:43] has affected our life that's what we are
[1:00:46] here fellowshipping around
[1:00:48] tonight amen so he said if you if you
[1:00:52] ever studied the history of Revival now
[1:00:56] a Revival signify a move of God in
[1:01:00] power amen a move of God in
[1:01:05] power now you you just think about it
[1:01:08] now there was no there was no other h h
[1:01:11] h creature there there was no human
[1:01:13] there it was not a crowd it was not a a
[1:01:17] Convention of 10 million people no this
[1:01:21] was almighty God
[1:01:24] himself amen
[1:01:27] amen with with nobody and nothing yet he
[1:01:32] move praise the Lord hallelujah and you
[1:01:36] don't need this this uh h a few group of
[1:01:39] people to experience the move of God you
[1:01:42] can have the move of God in your
[1:01:44] home praise the Lord amen God do not
[1:01:48] need a poopit he don't need a a musical
[1:01:52] team to move there were no musician
[1:01:53] there but yet God was having a Revival
[1:01:57] yes praise the Lord if God is determined
[1:02:01] to bring his word to pass there is
[1:02:03] nothing that is going to stop
[1:02:06] it God was determined to manifest his
[1:02:09] attributes he was determined to bring
[1:02:12] out his attribute he had this great plan
[1:02:15] in his mind and he was determined to
[1:02:17] manifest it so brother B let us know now
[1:02:20] Revival signified a move of God in power
[1:02:24] and he's trying to help us to see that
[1:02:27] every time God moves Satan is there to
[1:02:30] move also are we together praise the
[1:02:34] Lord amen so we will see we we will
[1:02:38] pretty we will pretty much see that it
[1:02:40] would take Genesis chapter one Genesis
[1:02:42] chapter 2 and in Genesis chapter 3
[1:02:45] that's when we will will now start to
[1:02:47] see Lucifer moving praise the Lord
[1:02:50] that's now we we start to see thou old
[1:02:53] serpent moving praise the Lord because
[1:02:56] you have to realize that his move is
[1:02:59] always an impersonation of God's move
[1:03:02] that's right amen praise the Lord
[1:03:06] hallelujah he always have to watch to
[1:03:08] see how the spirit of God is moving for
[1:03:10] him to impersonated and move are we
[1:03:14] together amen so Satan is there to move
[1:03:18] also he says it never
[1:03:21] fail praise the Lord it never fail H if
[1:03:27] it happened in the first Revival is
[1:03:29] going to happen in this revival and I
[1:03:32] say it is happening in this
[1:03:36] revival praise the Lord he's cting the
[1:03:40] message amen he has entered our message
[1:03:44] homes he's behind our message
[1:03:47] poits in the church hbook brother bam
[1:03:50] say he have invaded the pit using
[1:03:53] businessmen that's what he said he said
[1:03:56] businessman has invaded the
[1:04:00] pit when Jesus said my house is the
[1:04:03] House of Prayer they have turned it to
[1:04:06] uh uh uh the Chambers of
[1:04:09] Commerce are we together he said it has
[1:04:13] never
[1:04:14] failed now he's going to give us some
[1:04:17] things to watch out and that's what
[1:04:19] that's what I want to labor on a little
[1:04:21] bit tonight uh uh and then Sunday we
[1:04:23] will we will go a little bit further
[1:04:28] giving us an example here he says in the
[1:04:32] days of the Welsh
[1:04:33] Revival and most people don't know this
[1:04:37] the reason why most people don't know it
[1:04:40] is because many times when when there is
[1:04:43] a move of God when when there is uh uh
[1:04:46] when the blessings of God come down in a
[1:04:48] service we we only see the people that
[1:04:51] shout and praise the Lord the people
[1:04:53] that lift their hands up the people that
[1:04:55] walk Worship in the spirit that's what
[1:04:57] we see but we also don't see what the
[1:05:00] devil
[1:05:01] does because you cannot you cannot
[1:05:04] eliminate that even on the day of
[1:05:12] Pentecost because it never fails every
[1:05:15] time God move the devil also
[1:05:18] move he said most people don't know
[1:05:23] this they're insane as Solem fill up
[1:05:28] quickly
[1:05:30] amen and there was a great display of
[1:05:34] devil power to take away the attention
[1:05:38] from
[1:05:39] God and we seeing the same thing taking
[1:05:41] place
[1:05:43] now praise the Lord amen and that's what
[1:05:48] that's what I want to Dell on a little
[1:05:50] bit tonight as we talk about the move of
[1:05:52] God because look at that move that that
[1:05:55] was the move of God in
[1:05:59] creation that was the move of God in
[1:06:02] creation almighty God speaking his word
[1:06:05] into existence bringing a universe into
[1:06:08] existence creating the Heaven and the
[1:06:12] Earth what what a Revival I believe that
[1:06:17] because brother B says the first thing
[1:06:19] that God there was angels and the angels
[1:06:22] might have worshiped God for who know
[1:06:24] how long and now when God condescended
[1:06:28] and started creating I believe they all
[1:06:31] pull back and watch and says
[1:06:35] whoa this logos this being that we have
[1:06:38] been worshiping seeing the see the
[1:06:41] expression that is coming out of
[1:06:44] him the thing that he's speaking is
[1:06:47] coming to
[1:06:49] manifestation what is this
[1:06:51] being praise the Lord
[1:06:58] and the Bible says and in the sixth day
[1:07:00] the same God I said let there be light
[1:07:03] he says let us make man in our image I
[1:07:06] believe all the Angels pull back to
[1:07:09] watch what is
[1:07:13] this if this great
[1:07:16] God this one that we have been
[1:07:19] worshiping and uh and and and uh H H uh
[1:07:23] proclaiming ho it and War it and and and
[1:07:26] and and and
[1:07:28] wonderful if he can bring out a son and
[1:07:31] and and we see his words separating the
[1:07:33] water from the land and and and we see
[1:07:35] trees sprinking out of the earth now
[1:07:38] he's saying he's going to create a man
[1:07:41] in His image and in his likeness what is
[1:07:44] this I believe they all stood if they
[1:07:47] have hands to fold they fold their hands
[1:07:50] and they were
[1:07:52] watching what is this creature
[1:07:56] praise the
[1:07:58] Lord
[1:07:59] amen but you see when God made man he
[1:08:03] made man a spirit
[1:08:06] man praise the Lord he made man a spirit
[1:08:11] because he was making Man In His Image
[1:08:13] and in his
[1:08:19] likeness man was there but he was not
[1:08:24] there praise the Lord
[1:08:27] amen that is the mystery of our
[1:08:29] existence that's the reason why h h h
[1:08:32] ELO who says to to job where were you
[1:08:35] when the sons of God shouted for
[1:08:38] Joy because they were there but they
[1:08:41] were not
[1:08:42] there praise the
[1:08:45] Lord everything that God made came into
[1:08:49] a physical manifestation everything came
[1:08:52] into a visual manifestation but when he
[1:08:55] he made man he was a
[1:08:58] spirit praise the Lord and I think that
[1:09:02] thing got to the devil so it got to the
[1:09:05] devil so
[1:09:07] much he said the first thing he said
[1:09:10] he's going to make somebody in His image
[1:09:12] and in his
[1:09:14] likeness and now we can see
[1:09:18] him praise the
[1:09:20] lord we can't we can't see him man is
[1:09:23] there he's made he the Bible said he
[1:09:26] made man male and
[1:09:29] female created he them they were there
[1:09:34] but they were not
[1:09:35] there you see that is the thing that is
[1:09:38] so powerful about your
[1:09:42] spirit praise the Lord amen that is the
[1:09:46] thing that is so powerful about your
[1:09:48] spirit
[1:09:50] man it long existed before this body
[1:09:58] praise the
[1:09:59] Lord how long the man stayed in that
[1:10:02] state I don't know but what I know was
[1:10:06] God created man in His image and in his
[1:10:12] likeness and the devil could not figure
[1:10:15] it
[1:10:16] out everything that God when God said
[1:10:19] let there be light there was light the
[1:10:22] light was visible
[1:10:25] when he created the flowers of the earth
[1:10:27] they were
[1:10:29] visible praise the Lord oh my this is
[1:10:33] beautiful when he created the trees they
[1:10:36] were visible but when he created
[1:10:39] man man was not
[1:10:43] visible but man was
[1:10:45] there praise the
[1:10:49] Lord I believe that is some of the
[1:10:51] things that make the
[1:10:53] angels to know that now they are subject
[1:10:56] to this other
[1:11:00] creature because he's there but he's not
[1:11:03] there the same way you can be here and
[1:11:06] not
[1:11:07] here praise the Lord the same way your
[1:11:10] body can be here but you are not here
[1:11:13] man was there but he was not
[1:11:17] there praise the
[1:11:20] Lord it took a
[1:11:23] while God ignoring all of this Plan of
[1:11:27] Redemption all that he had in his mind
[1:11:30] and he knew that he was doing this thing
[1:11:33] because uh he has already created an an
[1:11:37] adversary called the devil he was
[1:11:39] Lucifer he knew that so you see God God
[1:11:44] kept his timing to himself amen the
[1:11:48] devil don't know God's timing concerning
[1:11:51] your life he don't know nothing about it
[1:11:54] God keep that to
[1:11:56] himself it was to God himself he knew
[1:12:00] when he wanted to put that man in
[1:12:05] flesh after the devil has wondered he
[1:12:09] has wondered he has wondered what is
[1:12:11] this man how do he looks
[1:12:14] like how do he looks
[1:12:17] like praise the
[1:12:20] Lord he wonder and wonder trying to
[1:12:24] figure this man that is in God's image
[1:12:27] you mean there is somebody that is going
[1:12:29] to be more closer to God than
[1:12:32] me he's trying to figure it out and he
[1:12:38] couldn't praise the
[1:12:41] Lord when he was not
[1:12:45] expecting then
[1:12:47] God the brother Bram
[1:12:50] said he make
[1:12:52] men of the Dust of the Earth Genesis
[1:12:56] 2:7 he formed the dust of the
[1:13:03] earth I believe that the devil was just
[1:13:06] watching and he saw this creature
[1:13:08] forming from the D dust of the Earth
[1:13:10] with legs and
[1:13:13] hands and standing
[1:13:16] there and the spirit of God
[1:13:20] move praise the Lord God move again and
[1:13:25] he breathed into that man and the Man
[1:13:28] became a living soul but say his toes
[1:13:31] were stuck in the earth like a
[1:13:34] root he had to kick his foot off the
[1:13:38] Earth praise the
[1:13:40] Lord
[1:13:41] amen are we together the spirit of God
[1:13:45] moved and God breath into man and Man
[1:13:48] became a living Soul before the devil
[1:13:51] will realize man is already on the Earth
[1:13:55] praise the Lord you see that's the
[1:13:57] reason why he did not hide the day you
[1:14:00] will be saved the devil never had it
[1:14:03] because if he had it he would have done
[1:14:05] everything for you to die before the day
[1:14:07] you got saved before he realized a Son
[1:14:11] of God was on the earth a Son of God was
[1:14:14] moving
[1:14:15] around amen and he was not even
[1:14:19] learning immediately he had Dominion he
[1:14:23] had power to speak big things into
[1:14:26] existence it took the Devil by surprise
[1:14:29] you mean are been here all this
[1:14:36] time praise the Lord that's the effect
[1:14:39] of the move of
[1:14:41] God if the first move of God produce son
[1:14:44] and daughter of God this move of God
[1:14:46] will produce Sons and Daughters of God
[1:14:49] no matter what they
[1:14:50] say amen hallelujah
[1:14:56] and took the Devil by surprise before he
[1:14:58] realized there was a man on the
[1:15:02] earth he said but I thought he said male
[1:15:05] and
[1:15:07] female because every other creature he
[1:15:10] brought them male and female I remember
[1:15:13] he said male and
[1:15:15] female but it's only one when is the
[1:15:18] female
[1:15:21] coming praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:15:26] before he will realize one day a take
[1:15:29] Darkness just came on the earth take
[1:15:32] Darkness God created so much darkness
[1:15:35] that the Devil Couldn't look through to
[1:15:40] see so much
[1:15:42] Darkness oh I'm feeling so good tonight
[1:15:46] praise the Lord
[1:15:48] hallelujah so much darkness that the
[1:15:51] devil would not even be able to spar
[1:15:53] what was going on
[1:15:55] before he will realize there is a woman
[1:15:57] on the
[1:15:59] earth oh my
[1:16:03] God oh my
[1:16:07] God that's what he said male and
[1:16:10] female man I wonder how he made
[1:16:15] him
[1:16:18] man because that
[1:16:22] woman she was carrying The Mystery of
[1:16:25] the Redemption in her God had to take
[1:16:30] take her behind the
[1:16:32] curtains amen you know like those days
[1:16:36] of developing fames they go into the
[1:16:38] dark
[1:16:40] room they take the negative into the
[1:16:43] dark room to be able to develop it and
[1:16:47] that's what almighty God was doing he
[1:16:50] took Eve into the dark room praise the
[1:16:53] Lord
[1:16:55] Hallelujah because in that weak of
[1:16:57] vessel he's going to put the mystery of
[1:17:00] redemption he's going to give her three
[1:17:03] sacri that he never gave to the
[1:17:05] man are we together you love the Lord
[1:17:09] tonight that was the first move of God
[1:17:11] the effect of the move of
[1:17:13] God praise the Lord you see when when
[1:17:17] when God
[1:17:20] move when the Bible says the spirit of
[1:17:22] God move
[1:17:25] he brought forth his
[1:17:27] attributes he brought forth a Son of God
[1:17:30] he brought forth a daughter of
[1:17:33] God they were so affected by the move of
[1:17:37] God that they were under the spirit of
[1:17:40] God and that's what this message should
[1:17:42] do to us amen if we are really affected
[1:17:47] praise the Lord but remember
[1:17:51] now B Bram said as we just read here
[1:17:56] remember he said most people don't know
[1:18:01] this praise the Lord and I believe even
[1:18:05] even uh HH Adam never knew it he was in
[1:18:10] this move of God I mean the Revival was
[1:18:12] going every day Adam had to do something
[1:18:15] I mean uh he felt so good when God comes
[1:18:18] down in the evening oh man he would give
[1:18:21] a report father I did this and I did
[1:18:24] that I mean he would name he named all
[1:18:26] the animals and just exactly the way
[1:18:29] that
[1:18:29] God Amen praise the
[1:18:33] Lord let a scor Come From Here let a
[1:18:35] scor come little fish I give you back
[1:18:37] your life I mean that's that's what Adam
[1:18:39] was doing in
[1:18:43] edting that was that was the effect of a
[1:18:46] move of
[1:18:48] God
[1:18:50] hallelujah and he thought it would be
[1:18:52] like that all the time
[1:18:55] and you see that's what
[1:18:57] happened when people experience
[1:19:01] Revival when they experience Revival
[1:19:04] Even in our own personal life God will
[1:19:07] give you a little measure maybe he's
[1:19:10] blessing your prayer life or he's
[1:19:12] blessing your your your understanding of
[1:19:14] the word he begins to pull the curtain
[1:19:16] and you beginning to get inside of the
[1:19:18] word you know sometimes those blessing
[1:19:21] just make us to feel so
[1:19:23] good amen
[1:19:25] and we want it like that every day we
[1:19:29] just want it to be like that praise the
[1:19:33] Lord amen Adam thought it was going to
[1:19:37] be like that he never believed that oh
[1:19:40] my what a time when when when when the
[1:19:42] Lord comes down in the evening I mean
[1:19:45] the the the worship the the fellowship
[1:19:48] just to see that God was well
[1:19:52] placed such such a ctif passion you know
[1:19:55] that thing of coming to service and
[1:19:57] Feeling So Satisfied you feel like he
[1:20:01] spoke to me I enjoy the word of God I
[1:20:05] enjoy the presence of God he never knew
[1:20:09] that it would not last
[1:20:12] long praise the
[1:20:14] Lord
[1:20:17] amen
[1:20:21] hallelujah that's what I will tell you
[1:20:23] tonight whever you are enjoying
[1:20:25] of the spirit of God you better enjoy it
[1:20:28] because it will not last
[1:20:30] long there is a devil that is fighting
[1:20:32] against it if you are enjoying the
[1:20:34] presence of God you better enjoy it amen
[1:20:38] you better enjoy
[1:20:40] it
[1:20:43] Hallelujah he didn't know that it would
[1:20:45] not last
[1:20:49] long Genesis
[1:20:53] 3 praise
[1:20:57] Lord Genesis
[1:21:01] 3 a year sin is introduced something has
[1:21:05] happened something has happened
[1:21:08] something has come into the
[1:21:10] camp praise the
[1:21:13] Lord For the First Time
[1:21:17] Adam and his wife they will come to this
[1:21:21] Consciousness that something has
[1:21:22] happened
[1:21:25] glory be to
[1:21:31] God you know what has
[1:21:35] happened the enemy just like brother
[1:21:38] brandom says here I'll read that
[1:21:43] again most people don't know this the
[1:21:47] insane Asom fil
[1:21:49] earthquake and there was a great display
[1:21:53] of devil power
[1:21:55] to take away the attention from
[1:21:58] God and that very same thing happened in
[1:22:01] the first
[1:22:02] Revival praise the Lord now you have to
[1:22:06] realize that the devil
[1:22:10] affected their reasoning it's a sense of
[1:22:13] the
[1:22:14] spirit amen you see because he knows
[1:22:19] that the first form that God created in
[1:22:21] was a spirit
[1:22:23] being so so if he can affect their
[1:22:26] Spirit he can get their body under
[1:22:32] control praise the Lord so he affected
[1:22:35] their
[1:22:38] reasoning the God say so that's why he
[1:22:41] started with Eve affected her
[1:22:45] reasoning and she gives into the devil
[1:22:48] lying and we know sin has entered so you
[1:22:51] see what happened here just like brother
[1:22:54] said
[1:22:55] a a spirit of
[1:23:00] insanity was now injected into the
[1:23:03] hemorage which is
[1:23:06] doubt
[1:23:08] amen which is
[1:23:11] unbelief are we
[1:23:17] together but think about
[1:23:22] it what the Bible says the Bible says
[1:23:25] when when uh when King was born she says
[1:23:27] I have received a man from the
[1:23:30] Lord Brother Braham says in in uh in uh
[1:23:34] uh uh the church age book he said she he
[1:23:37] says that if actually
[1:23:40] believe that he was a man from the
[1:23:45] Lord praise the lord it's truth that God
[1:23:49] is the one that give life but she never
[1:23:52] realized that
[1:23:55] something has affected
[1:23:57] her praise the Lord that she's giving
[1:24:01] birth to a seed of The Serpent and yet
[1:24:04] she called it is from the
[1:24:06] Lord do you see that
[1:24:09] Insanity where people can be doing
[1:24:11] things contrary to the word and they say
[1:24:14] God told
[1:24:16] me and they can actually believe that it
[1:24:18] is
[1:24:22] God praise the Lord
[1:24:25] until King will kill Abel Eve would
[1:24:28] never
[1:24:29] believe that this was not a man from the
[1:24:33] Lord until King will kill his own
[1:24:36] brother right in the
[1:24:39] field before she will come to the
[1:24:41] realization oh my God but she believe
[1:24:46] it she believe
[1:24:49] it why God came down and and and and
[1:24:52] wrapped them in sheep's skin and and you
[1:24:54] know and and and try to reconcile them
[1:24:57] and bring them back and and and so she
[1:24:59] took that mercy of God she took that
[1:25:02] grace of God and did not realize that
[1:25:05] the devil has injected a wrong seed in
[1:25:12] her praise the Lord she said I have
[1:25:15] received a man from the Lord she believe
[1:25:18] it she believed that thou was a man of
[1:25:21] God
[1:25:25] are we
[1:25:26] together but see the effect of the
[1:25:28] Revival they have just had the Glorious
[1:25:32] time of the Revival they had a time
[1:25:35] where God was coming down every meeting
[1:25:38] God came down every service God came
[1:25:40] down now the church is going through a
[1:25:43] tough time they have to sing they have
[1:25:46] to pray and sometime the service is dry
[1:25:49] I mean they are not having the kind of a
[1:25:51] Revival they used to have
[1:25:57] are we
[1:25:58] together see what will
[1:26:01] happen King Andel is born and they are
[1:26:04] sharing with them I mean I mean yeah at
[1:26:07] the beginning of the message at at the
[1:26:09] beginning of this revival oh my God you
[1:26:12] see that Hill down there it used to be
[1:26:15] down there I I I sent it down there
[1:26:17] really Daddy
[1:26:20] really and they giving them all of this
[1:26:22] story about the Revival just like we
[1:26:25] hear everything on tape we were now
[1:26:28] there praise the Lord hallelujah and and
[1:26:32] and he giv them everything everything
[1:26:35] that was happening oh my God you know uh
[1:26:38] H H uh I don't know I mean this this
[1:26:40] animal just came before me I man I I
[1:26:44] what a glorious time it was I mean
[1:26:46] something just got a hold of me and I
[1:26:48] said you are a
[1:26:50] lion can you believe that evening God
[1:26:52] came down and he he said that's exactly
[1:26:56] the name oh my God is giving them the
[1:26:59] Revival the report of the Revival when
[1:27:02] the Revival was in his
[1:27:04] fire just like men will come and preach
[1:27:06] and and when he talk about you know
[1:27:08] brother Brandon you know and what
[1:27:09] happened in the meeting and says my
[1:27:11] mother was in the meeting or my father
[1:27:13] was in the meeting I mean you hold to
[1:27:15] that so
[1:27:16] close because you know that this is an
[1:27:19] eyewitness Adam was an
[1:27:22] eyewitness but king and a they were now
[1:27:24] eye witnesses before they
[1:27:27] came something has happened to the
[1:27:30] Revival something has happened to the
[1:27:33] move of God and I will tell you Church
[1:27:37] before we
[1:27:39] came before we came you and myself
[1:27:43] something has happened to the
[1:27:45] Revival praise the Lord something has
[1:27:49] happened to this move of God
[1:27:54] is
[1:27:56] different than when the prophet of God
[1:27:58] was on the earth praise the Lord amen
[1:28:03] but God is still
[1:28:06] moving Hallelujah God is still
[1:28:11] moving that did not stop God from moving
[1:28:14] God was still moving how did we know
[1:28:16] that God was
[1:28:17] moving because if it got a
[1:28:22] revelation if got got a revelation of
[1:28:26] what took place when he was not there he
[1:28:29] got a revelation when he was not born
[1:28:32] what took place in Genesis chapter 3 he
[1:28:35] was able to that that was the move of
[1:28:37] God you see the move of God H Adam
[1:28:41] experienced it in a different way Abel
[1:28:44] experienced it in a different way Abel
[1:28:47] experienced it on the
[1:28:51] Revelation are we together
[1:28:55] praise the
[1:29:01] Lord oh
[1:29:03] my but this is where I want to get to
[1:29:05] before we
[1:29:09] close as as a as H King Andia was
[1:29:13] listening to to the message that was
[1:29:15] preached and they were telling them
[1:29:16] about God came down and what happened
[1:29:19] you know uh and and how wonderful it was
[1:29:21] and and how beautiful it was I mean
[1:29:24] there there was there was a there was a
[1:29:26] desire there was just Crave in the heart
[1:29:28] of Abel he was just craving oh God oh
[1:29:33] God I want to experience that amen and
[1:29:37] I'm I just don't want to rely on my
[1:29:39] parents experience I want to experience
[1:29:41] it for
[1:29:43] myself and God gave him an experience
[1:29:46] God struck him with a
[1:29:49] revelation and the Revelation became his
[1:29:52] Revival
[1:29:54] praise the
[1:29:56] Lord a creat a desire in him to go and
[1:29:59] worship a creat a desire in him to bring
[1:30:03] an excellent
[1:30:05] sacrifice praise the Lord
[1:30:10] hallelujah that's the effect of the
[1:30:12] Revival the Revival will will affect you
[1:30:16] and it will create in you a desire for
[1:30:19] true worship you will not just be
[1:30:22] satisfied with church worship you will
[1:30:24] one true worship and they that worship
[1:30:27] the father will worship Him in spirit
[1:30:29] and in
[1:30:31] truth
[1:30:34] hallelujah king was there he was
[1:30:37] enjoying his
[1:30:38] Birthright he
[1:30:40] heard Eve saying over and over when you
[1:30:44] were born I said I've received a man
[1:30:47] from the
[1:30:48] Lord all of that was just making his
[1:30:50] shoulder big he fell like a man from the
[1:30:53] Lord
[1:30:55] praise the Lord he felt like being a man
[1:30:58] from the Lord he could do
[1:31:01] anything he was not giving heed to the
[1:31:03] word that was being preached he had no
[1:31:06] desire to experience God he was just
[1:31:08] going on the
[1:31:13] Praises praise the Lord but remember now
[1:31:18] brother bandam told us that honor every
[1:31:20] Revival when God move Satan also move
[1:31:24] and when the devil move what he does is
[1:31:27] that he bring a spirit of insanity he
[1:31:31] affect the
[1:31:35] people to challenge the authority of the
[1:31:41] word can you see how bored King was so
[1:31:45] much that when God came down to talk to
[1:31:48] him he said am I My Brother's
[1:31:51] Keeper praise the Lord
[1:31:54] he was in the
[1:31:56] Revival he was on his effect of the
[1:31:59] Revival the Revival affected him in a
[1:32:02] different way than it affected Abel Abel
[1:32:06] was affected by a
[1:32:09] revelation to bring worship and
[1:32:12] sacrifice to
[1:32:13] God King was affected in the wrong
[1:32:18] way he was challenging the word of God
[1:32:21] am I my brother keeper speaking right
[1:32:24] back to God God said if you can go back
[1:32:26] and do what your brother God is making
[1:32:29] every provision is not in him to
[1:32:33] repent it's not in him to submit himself
[1:32:36] to the
[1:32:38] word oh he can cut the courts he can
[1:32:41] talk about when when uh when the
[1:32:43] mountains were made when the Lions were
[1:32:45] named when all the animals was named
[1:32:48] that Spirit of
[1:32:51] arrogance praise the Lord are you seeing
[1:32:54] the same thing in your
[1:32:57] Revival the spirit of arrogance a spirit
[1:33:01] that can't submit to the
[1:33:04] word we call everything God God spoke to
[1:33:08] me God told me and we're not able to
[1:33:11] bring what God Said back to the
[1:33:17] word let me tell you I've dwelt in this
[1:33:21] place for the while and started think
[1:33:24] is the very same thing that is happening
[1:33:26] in our
[1:33:28] Revival we have a bunch of insane people
[1:33:32] people have been affected by this
[1:33:33] revival it never gave them birth they
[1:33:36] are not born again the Revival did not
[1:33:38] change their life the Revival only make
[1:33:41] them
[1:33:42] arrogant it put a religious spirit on
[1:33:45] them and they are just Arrogant with no
[1:33:48] birth no Revelation a true revelation of
[1:33:52] God will submit to the word of God not
[1:33:55] how you explain it is how you live
[1:34:05] it the effect of the
[1:34:08] Revival praise the
[1:34:11] Lord I don't know how this revival is
[1:34:13] affecting you it's not enough to say I'm
[1:34:16] in the message I'm born in the message
[1:34:18] all of those things they have there I
[1:34:20] mean it's good to to edify yourself
[1:34:27] are we together how is the Revival
[1:34:30] affecting us this is the move of
[1:34:33] God and when God moved in the beginning
[1:34:36] it brought a creation a new creation the
[1:34:40] move of God will bring a new creation in
[1:34:42] our
[1:34:44] lives see all of these things that are
[1:34:46] taking
[1:34:47] place and yet we say we are in the in
[1:34:50] the message we are in the Revival there
[1:34:52] is no other Revival than the seven T of
[1:34:56] Revival and man with unconverted
[1:35:00] Spirits what did the Bible
[1:35:03] says God came down and spoke to a
[1:35:07] King he refused he challenge the the the
[1:35:11] spirit of
[1:35:12] God and what
[1:35:16] happened the Bible says God put a mark
[1:35:19] on
[1:35:21] him he was going away from the Revival
[1:35:24] as a
[1:35:25] vabor he will be a man that will roam
[1:35:28] around and tell people I'm in the
[1:35:30] message oh I know I know that preacher I
[1:35:32] know Eddie bisco I know H he can call
[1:35:36] all the big preachers name he will just
[1:35:39] be moving
[1:35:41] around but he can never come to
[1:35:45] rest he can never come to
[1:35:49] rest it's a spirit of insanity it goes
[1:35:53] with every
[1:35:56] Revival remember now brother Brandon
[1:35:58] told us you can never come into the
[1:36:01] presence of God and ever go back to
[1:36:05] same they either change your life for
[1:36:07] the better or you go back to
[1:36:11] worse that's a typical example right
[1:36:14] there in eding it
[1:36:18] Chang Abel for the better because he got
[1:36:22] a revelation
[1:36:25] a affected King in a way that he could
[1:36:28] kill his own brother with no
[1:36:34] remars you know this is that what Jesus
[1:36:37] said Jesus said they will even kill you
[1:36:39] and say God told them to do it that's
[1:36:42] why he told his
[1:36:45] disciple because those Pharisees were
[1:36:47] they were also in a
[1:36:50] Revival we get we'll get to that we'll
[1:36:53] bring it down
[1:36:54] we bring it down we just dealing with
[1:36:55] Eden that was the first
[1:36:58] Revival Noah had a Revival 120 years
[1:37:03] preaching the message standing as a
[1:37:05] preacher of
[1:37:11] righteousness at the end of his Revival
[1:37:13] he was lying
[1:37:15] drunk he was lying naked drunk

[1:37:55] and they can never they can never they
[1:37:57] can never see that they they have they
[1:38:01] have a spirit of insanity why because
[1:38:03] it's a religious spirit it justify
[1:38:06] everything by the
[1:38:08] word they can be stealing they were
[1:38:10] justifi by the word lying they were
[1:38:12] justifi by the word it's a religious
[1:38:16] spirit when you come into the presence
