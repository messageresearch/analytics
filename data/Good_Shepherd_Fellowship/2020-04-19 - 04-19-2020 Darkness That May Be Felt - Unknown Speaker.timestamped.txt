[26:57] hand towards heaven that there may be
[27:01] darkness over the land of Egypt even
[27:07] darkness which may be felt I want to
[27:12] talk on darkness that can be felt the

[27:18] heaven and there was a thick darkness in
[27:24] all the land of Egypt three days they

[28:13] Spirit will be able to come out of the
[28:15] pages of the world move to our hatch
[28:18] this morning father meters where we are
[28:21] this morning we love you and we
[28:23] appreciate you Father in Jesus precious
[28:26] name we pray amen
[28:29] as I kept a six-tier why we take our
[28:32] seats
[28:36] praise Lord as I chapter 16 verse 1
[28:50] arise shine for the light is come and
[28:54] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[28:58] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[29:04] earth and gross darkness to people but
[29:09] the law shall arise upon thee and his
[29:12] glory shall be seen upon thee amen first
[29:17] of all we mean we may never know and
[29:22] understand the darkness that meaning is
[29:26] feeling in this hour praise the Lord and
[29:32] I just read about a neighbor this
[29:37] morning in Rosemount and very very
[29:44] wonderful man
[29:46] I mean testify about all of his
[29:48] neighbors and I mean he was he was now
[29:55] welding I mean he was in the hospital
[29:58] and at the time they thought he has
[30:02] break out of you know the the cover
[30:06] sickness they took him home and right
[30:09] when he got home he asked to sit down
[30:12] and I mean he just he just started
[30:16] struggling over his birth and kept
[30:17] telling his wife I can't breathe you
[30:19] know I can breathe better and then in a
[30:23] short period of time he he was gone and
[30:26] a meaning I mean many families
[30:32] Christians I mean
[30:39] four people are experiencing hurting in
[30:45] different things and just thinking about
[30:49] this and account for a little bit
[30:54] struggling my mind this morning and I
[30:58] mean to be able to to speak on this in a
[31:02] way that it would be it would be
[31:05] edifying to us who be able to draw
[31:07] strength from me praise the Lord
[31:10] know that brother branham rare from this
[31:13] as I chapter or scripture when he
[31:17] preached a message Shalom and he was
[31:19] kind of a distraction letting us to know
[31:22] that the day that we are living in you
[31:25] know that the darkness there was the
[31:29] gross darkness that was upon the people
[31:31] was a spiritual darkness and and we can
[31:34] see a shadow of that in the book of
[31:38] Exodus and I will also bring us to the
[31:42] place to realize that that is one of the
[31:46] Exeter experience when world is
[31:49] experiencing darkness then it's time for
[31:52] an accident because there was one of the
[31:55] play and and and if you also look at the
[32:00] seals I was going to do something a
[32:02] little bit this morning were blood
[32:09] Branum he was able to to to let us see
[32:13] there let's let's let's look at that a
[32:16] little bit over in Matthew chapter 24
[32:19] before we look at this subject together
[32:22] let just go to Matthew chapter 24 and
[32:25] and see if we can be able to follow
[32:31] their together my
[32:36] to chapter 24 verb and indeed there are
[32:41] like a Bible study when he was preaching
[32:45] the seals and I love some things he said
[32:52] I dropped that in my note this morning
[32:57] he said this the 6u he said
[33:07] now let's look to match you the 24
[33:11] chapter the lamb himself speaking now
[33:17] anyone knows that Jesus is the author of
[33:23] the whole book as as far as they are
[33:29] concerned but his species is salmon to
[33:34] the people all right to the Jews then he
[33:38] dropped down again
[33:39] he said now watch this name and you can
[33:46] find out and see what the lamb here is
[33:50] showing exactly in symbol what he said
[33:56] over year in words doing exactly now
[34:00] what he's talking about is that what
[34:03] Jesus is saying in Matthew chapter 24
[34:06] it's what he's showing in Revelation
[34:09] chapter 6 in a symbol form so the entire
[34:14] Matthew chapter 24 where Branham says
[34:17] that was the seals Jesus in his earthly
[34:21] ministry was telling the disciples he
[34:26] was preaching the seals but in his
[34:31] ministry in a church ages coming back in
[34:35] a form of the Holy Ghost he is carrying
[34:38] John that is a type of the bride he's
[34:42] showing John the very same thing he
[34:44] preached in Matthew chapter 24
[34:48] let's look at their together a little
[34:51] bit and and the reason why I want to do
[34:58] that is it would help me to be able to
[35:03] bring out my subject a little bit here
[35:06] he says over in Matthew chapter 24 and
[35:16] Jesus went out and departed from the
[35:19] temple and the disciple came to him to
[35:23] show him the building of the temple and
[35:26] Jesus said unto them see ye not all
[35:33] these things verily I say unto you there
[35:37] shall not be left here one stone upon
[35:41] another that shall not be thrown down
[35:44] and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives
[35:48] the disciples came unto him privately
[35:51] saying tell us when shall these things
[35:55] be and what shall be the sign of your
[35:58] coming and of the end of the world now
[36:01] brother Branham there he said also there
[36:05] he said every scallop when ready to talk
[36:07] about the tribulation they will go over
[36:10] to Matthew chapter 24 because there
[36:13] Jesus from his own mouth talked about
[36:17] the great tribulation that we come but
[36:20] then he also helped us to understand
[36:23] that Jesus was addressing three
[36:25] questions even though he did not point
[36:30] out and says well your first question
[36:33] you asked me this is the answer the
[36:35] second question you asked me this is the
[36:37] answer because he always spoke in
[36:40] parables so but he was addressing the
[36:44] three questions that were asking about a
[36:47] disciple he says tell us when shall
[36:51] these things be because Jesus has
[36:54] already said there will now be one stone
[36:56] left upon another
[36:58] so when with these things be
[37:01] and he says also they asked him what is
[37:05] the sign of your coming and what is also
[37:09] the tare question is the end of the word
[37:13] so he says here if you if you compare
[37:17] that with Revelation chapter 6 so let's
[37:22] open back in for Matthew chapter 24
[37:26] Revelation chapter 6 we will go back and
[37:28] forth with that and and hope that we can
[37:32] be able to just do a little Bible
[37:33] studies here with brother Branham out of
[37:36] the the six seals and now so over here
[37:55] in the sixth seal
[37:57] Revelation chapter six I mean Revelation
[38:00] chapter six over in Revelation chapter
[38:02] six not just the six you but over in
[38:05] Revelation chapter 6 because Revelation
[38:07] chapter 6 speaks of all the seals now
[38:11] Revelation chapter 6 verse 1 and I saw
[38:14] when the lamb opened one of the seal and
[38:19] I heard in it word a noise of thunder
[38:24] one of the four beasts saying come and
[38:32] see
[38:34] Matthew chapter 12 Jesus spoke and the
[38:39] tundle rode in heaven and and the
[38:42] disciples heard it under the people
[38:45] around here that under Jesus heard the
[38:47] voice he said this voice came because of
[38:50] you Moses on the mountain when God was
[38:54] giving him the commandments sounded out
[38:57] to the people they were year in
[38:59] lightning and thunder coming from the
[39:01] mountain Moses was hearing - honesty
[39:04] thou shalt not bear false witness and he
[39:07] was writing all of those things down and
[39:09] but down the people were hearing
[39:12] lightning and thunder now so we
[39:15] it allows a loud thunder year and and
[39:18] one of the four beasts saying come and
[39:20] see
[39:21] now he says here and I saw and behold a
[39:31] white house and he does sat on him had a
[39:36] board and a crown was given unto him and
[39:40] he went forth to come he went forth
[39:45] conquering and to conquer
[39:47] now a mighty chapter 24 verse four and
[39:54] five jesus said jesus answered and said
[39:58] unto them take heed that no man deceive
[40:02] you for many shall come in my name
[40:05] saying I am the Christ and shall deceive
[40:09] many
[40:09] so yeah Jesus here in his earthly
[40:13] ministry answering this question the
[40:16] first thing in a three question that he
[40:20] approached to answer was there will be
[40:22] many false Christ's under the seal the
[40:26] first horse rather was growing without
[40:29] you know an arrow aboard the Antichrist
[40:33] so brother branham here is trying to
[40:36] make us to understand that this seals
[40:40] and the revelation of the seals was
[40:42] Jesus Christ he was the one that
[40:45] interpret his word because he's saying a
[40:50] year in his earthly ministry compared to
[40:53] what he revealed to John in Revelation
[40:56] chapter 6 so here is the first the first
[41:00] seal open wave the Antichrist and Jesus
[41:04] answering the three question his first
[41:07] answer he start with is with the
[41:10] Antichrist praise the Lord
[41:13] Revelation chapter 6 and when
[41:19] he had opened the second seal I heard
[41:23] the second be saying come and see
[41:26] and there went out another hers that was
[41:31] red the red house and power was given to
[41:36] him that sat thereon to take peace from
[41:38] the earth and dead and that they should
[41:44] kill one another and there was given
[41:47] unto him a great song Matthew chapter 24
[41:54] verse 6 and yes I hear of wars and
[42:00] rumors of war once see that he may be
[42:06] net trouble for all these things must
[42:11] come to pass but the end is not yet
[42:15] and one of the question was when is the
[42:18] end of the world praise the Lord and
[42:23] Jesus here he first talked about the
[42:27] Antichrist the next thing he talked
[42:29] about wars and rumors of war when the
[42:32] first few was open there was a white
[42:36] horse and the rider had a ball he never
[42:40] had no arrow when the second sea was
[42:44] open there was the the Red House was
[42:48] going with swore killing and there
[42:52] fulfill wars and Romans of war I will to
[42:57] get it
[43:00] praise the Lord
[43:05] early in chapter 6 verse 5 and when he
[43:10] had opened they tells you I heard the
[43:14] third beast saying come and see
[43:16] and behold a black house and he that sat
[43:20] on him had a pair of balance in his
[43:25] hands
[43:28] and I heard a voice in the midst of the
[43:34] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[43:37] penny and three measures of barley for a
[43:43] penny and see that thou hurt not the oil
[43:48] and the wine praise the Lord
[43:51] now Wednesday night we were talking
[43:53] about seller of oil but then when we
[43:56] look when we look at this beast they
[43:58] never had the oil they were only selling
[44:01] Ballad of wheat praise the Lord they
[44:06] were not supposed to touch the oil and
[44:08] the wine praise the Lord they only had a
[44:12] ballad of wheat bourbon type that honor
[44:15] the church edges you know when purgatory
[44:17] and Catholic Church style is setting all
[44:19] of these things and you know keeping
[44:23] people places you know for internal life
[44:27] and all of that so back to Matthew
[44:31] chapter 24
[44:43] now ever seven he says for nation shall
[44:49] rise against nation and Kingdom against
[44:52] Kingdom and there shall be famines and
[44:55] pestilence now brother branham put that
[44:58] honor the tears you for me because here
[45:02] a ballot of wheat for a penny amen
[45:06] he says he placed that under the test
[45:10] you because I mean you see they're also
[45:13] on Elijah ministry when when there was
[45:17] famine in the land I mean there was I
[45:19] mean there was rushing for food and in
[45:22] order so he placed their honor
[45:25] that tells you where we have this but we
[45:28] have to realize here he says that the
[45:31] eye shall not hurt the oil and the wine
[45:34] and he says and when verse seven and
[45:40] when he had opened the fourth seal I
[45:42] heard the voice of the four beasts
[45:45] saying come and see
[45:47] and behold and lo and behold a pale
[45:53] horse and his Inn and his name that sat
[45:57] on him was death and hell followed him
[46:00] and power was given unto them over the
[46:05] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[46:07] sword and with hunger and with death and
[46:12] with the beasts of the earth now if you
[46:18] take this and you take it back to what
[46:23] we read some time ago over in the Book
[46:25] of Ezekiel chapter 14 and the the for
[46:30] the force called whip that God used to
[46:33] deal with Israel we realize the same
[46:35] thing is also year applying over to the
[46:38] Gentile Church in in year we find a song
[46:41] we find hunger we find that and we find
[46:44] a piece of the earth now but bourbon a
[46:49] year would take this
[46:54] then I'm losing my place here okay in
[47:04] verse eight he says and these are just
[47:06] the beginning of sorrow then they shall
[47:08] deliver you they will deliver you up to
[47:12] be afflicted and they shall kill you you
[47:15] see that's the pure hearts death they
[47:17] will kill you and nehi and they shall be
[47:20] hurt of all nations for my name's sake
[47:23] and then he went on it says and and and
[47:27] and then shall many be offended and
[47:31] shall betray one another and shall hate
[47:33] one another you know and many false
[47:38] prophet and shall rise and shall deceive
[47:44] many I'm going a little bit ahead of
[47:47] myself here but let me let me kind of a
[47:50] slow down so we read right here the four
[47:53] seal open and over in the fifth seal he
[48:00] says and when he had opened the fifth
[48:04] seal I saw under the altar souls of them
[48:08] that were slain for the word of God and
[48:11] for the for the word of God and for the
[48:16] testimony which they had now I was
[48:19] listening to her Branham this morning he
[48:22] says remember that the bride over in the
[48:26] book of Revelation had the testimony of
[48:29] Jesus Christ
[48:30] he said but this one they were slain for
[48:33] the testimony which they had he said so
[48:36] this displaced this and identify this as
[48:40] the Jews okay honor this fifth seal he
[48:45] said I blessed and identified him as the
[48:48] Jews so as we look here also were the
[48:53] scripture are speaking here and talking
[48:56] about and they shall deliver you up and
[48:58] afflict you in and kill you he says in
[49:02] many be offended and they shall be trade
[49:07] one another and they shall hate one
[49:10] another you know brother Brennan brought
[49:14] that out you know and he talked about a
[49:16] little bit you know during the time of
[49:20] the I mean Hitler Holocaust and all of
[49:24] their how they produce upon Jews you
[49:28] know you know they were some of those
[49:31] Jews to save the alive they had to
[49:34] persecute their brothers you know and
[49:37] some of them found favor with with the
[49:40] Germans and different government in the
[49:42] world and they were said even though
[49:44] they had they had the six Star of David
[49:47] on their hand but yet they were the one
[49:49] that was persecuting their brothers you
[49:51] know and he brought that out so he
[49:53] pleased that right under the fifth seal
[49:55] so then he goes on here you know with
[50:03] those ones he sees in the crime with a
[50:06] loud voice saying how long O Lord holy
[50:11] and true they are dead Josh and avenge
[50:16] the blood of them dared war upon the
[50:19] earth and they were giving white robes
[50:21] he says there had to be the Jews then he
[50:25] come over here to the sixth seal now
[50:29] this will kind of a grab our attention a
[50:32] little bit wider you know because as I
[50:35] was studying on this on this darkness on
[50:39] this darkness that could be felt and I
[50:43] was trying to look through the scripture
[50:45] and look through the message I came
[50:47] directly over here into the SEC seal
[50:49] because that's where bourbon also talked
[50:51] about darkness that will come upon the
[50:54] earth so that's how I got into all this
[50:56] but that's okay so he said yet and the
[51:01] six you and I beheld when he had opened
[51:04] the sixth seal and lo there was a great
[51:07] earthquake and the Sun became black as
[51:12] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[51:18] blood and the stars of heaven fell
[51:21] onto the earth even as a fig tree
[51:24] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[51:29] shaken wave a mighty wing and the heaven
[51:34] departed as a straw now under the the
[51:40] six-year brother Branham says this is
[51:42] one of the longest seal he says why he
[51:44] said because the sixth seal is the seal
[51:47] of judgment but he said the six you
[51:52] being a seal of judgment the bride is
[51:57] not supposed to be here at that time
[52:02] because God is not going to take his
[52:05] wife true judgment praise the Lord
[52:12] so he says the bride is not supposed to
[52:15] be here now the reason why I'm saying
[52:18] there and making emphasis is because
[52:21] talking about this darkness that can be
[52:24] failed and and in reading over here in
[52:27] the sixth seal
[52:28] I'm not saying we are in this time
[52:32] because this darkness that can be felt
[52:35] is a spiritual darkness as compared to
[52:39] the darkness over in Isaiah 60 verse 1
[52:45] verbatim say it was a spiritual darkness
[52:48] we know when that when when that when
[52:52] the angel of the Lord came down and drew
[52:54] the church ages on the blackboard loud
[52:57] assured age was in darkness praise the
[53:02] Lord
[53:02] now let's watch another thing when we
[53:05] come true the sixth seal yeah in
[53:09] Revelation chapter six the six view is
[53:15] from verse 12 to verse 17 praise the
[53:19] Lord
[53:20] that's the six you now if you read over
[53:23] in Jesus own when he when he spoke to
[53:29] his disciples on this
[53:31] he went true
[53:33] and his sex you was all that he talked
[53:36] about that close well I mean I'm Archie
[53:39] chapter 24 now you can see why the
[53:44] Seventh Seal was selling because Matthew
[53:49] chapter 25 behold the bridegroom cometh
[53:53] is the seven seals praise the Lord
[54:01] so just like how John was shown the
[54:06] seals in the book of Revelation where
[54:09] Branham says Jesus spoke about that in
[54:12] Matthew chapter 24 he spoke by from the
[54:17] first seal to the six you and he left
[54:20] its ally he just left it like that when
[54:23] he came to the seven see you he brought
[54:25] a parable of the bridegroom that cometh
[54:30] are we together
[54:32] praise the Lord now so when we look at
[54:36] this this darkness that is failed let's
[54:39] go to Genesis chapter 1 let's get to our
[54:43] subject now I think I free myself a
[54:46] little bit by talking on this here I
[54:49] mean I take I think it's I think it's
[54:57] easy dealing dealing with the pool when
[55:00] the people are there than when they are
[55:01] pulling you through these through the
[55:03] through the media whatsoever device that
[55:05] here they are following the service wave
[55:08] the food I mean their fourth dimension
[55:12] is just going through my body it's
[55:13] making me more nervous
[55:20] Genesis chapter 1 let's go to Genesis
[55:23] chapter 1 I can stand you're looking I
[55:25] mean what are you are owning or anything
[55:27] I can stand it but you know you pull him
[55:30] in through those media is just cheap my
[55:33] body to sew pieces yeah praise the Lord
[55:36] Genesis chapter 1 let's look at this
[55:38] together now we did a little bit of a
[55:42] study on Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in
[55:44] the beginning and we said that beginning
[55:46] was the foundation because the the
[55:49] foundation is the beginning of anything
[55:51] amen so everything that God did for the
[55:54] elite for you and myself he did it right
[55:58] in their beginning now look at verse 2
[56:01] praise the Lord and I will want you to
[56:04] to take note on this verse to do your
[56:07] own Bible studies on it whatever you
[56:09] find call me and let's fellowship
[56:11] together the earth was without form and
[56:16] Val now we're talking about darkness now
[56:19] look at this and darkness was upon the
[56:24] face of the D since almost 5 o'clock
[56:28] this morning
[56:29] I've been sitting down and just reading
[56:32] looking through the scripture looking
[56:34] through the code the face of the deep
[56:37] what is this darkness was upon the face
[56:42] of the deep what is the face of the deep
[56:46] do your Bible studies I will I will I
[56:50] will appreciate wherever you find
[56:51] sharing with me praise the Lord I will
[56:55] have the opportunity for you to preach
[56:57] to me into darkness was upon the face of
[57:00] the deep and the Spirit of God moved
[57:04] upon the face of the water praise the
[57:08] Lord
[57:09] amen the face of the waters we can be
[57:12] able to find it you know Jesus walk on
[57:16] water we can take that as a type but the
[57:19] face of the deep
[57:20] I want us to study there together let's
[57:23] go ahead now and God said let there be
[57:26] light and there was light
[57:29] praise the Lord a
[57:33] so we want to look at this darkness that
[57:36] could be fed we realized that there was
[57:39] judgment coming to to Egypt anybody but
[57:47] the Bible said the place was so dark
[57:52] that he could not even see one another
[57:56] praise the Lord they could not see one
[58:00] another everybody was in their place and
[58:04] the darkness could be felt praise the
[58:11] Lord Amen now so when you look at this
[58:15] subject of darkness right from Genesis
[58:19] chapter one that we have just read a
[58:21] darkness that was upon the face of the
[58:24] deep
[58:25] I'm going to take this word darkness I'm
[58:27] going to take deep and we will follow it
[58:29] through alone in in Scripture together
[58:31] it might be able to help us praise the
[58:34] Lord the word deep the next time we will
[58:37] find the scripture using that word was
[58:41] when God told Adam to a deep sleep
[58:46] phrase alone was where a God put Adam to
[58:51] a deep sleep and we know that at a time
[58:55] that God told Adam to a deep sleep it
[58:58] was under a type of redemption I am
[59:04] going to a deep sleep it was just like
[59:06] Jesus going to the cross and when he was
[59:10] on the cross what happened there was
[59:12] darkness again the earth the Sun refused
[59:17] to shine the moon refused to show its
[59:19] light it was darkness just at a time
[59:22] word the bride was going to be released
[59:26] from our Lord Jesus side there was
[59:30] darkness are we together amen
[59:37] now so
[59:39] and and and and we see that that was
[59:41] there was a place in the scripture that
[59:43] just that just I just caught my
[59:46] attention I never saw him till this
[59:48] morning you remember when David was
[59:52] running away from Saul
[59:56] praise the Lord and he got there on
[1:00:00] I mean hide himself in the mountain and
[1:00:03] saw running after him the occasion where
[1:00:06] David came close he came close and he
[1:00:11] caught off saw Garmin the scripture says
[1:00:15] First Samuel chapter 26 verse 12 their
[1:00:20] Lord allowed a deep sleep to come upon
[1:00:29] yeah
[1:00:31] that's a there's there's that's the
[1:00:34] Hebrew word that I saw Amy yeah this
[1:00:36] morning that's that's right
[1:00:37] praise the Lord he Allah a deep sleep
[1:00:41] once again to come on Saul and I was
[1:00:43] thinking oh my goodness what what
[1:00:47] actually was God trying to bring out of
[1:00:50] that picture because the second time to
[1:01:00] the time of Adam that God would do that
[1:01:05] was Genesis chapter 15 and Genesis
[1:01:11] chapter 15 is also about Redemption
[1:01:14] because God was sealing his promise
[1:01:17] because he there was no one greater than
[1:01:20] him and he could not swim and no one
[1:01:22] else he was swearing by himself he
[1:01:25] brought Abraham out to a place Abraham
[1:01:28] brought all the sacrifice and set
[1:01:31] everything out and and and it came to a
[1:01:34] place he had to put deep sleep on
[1:01:37] Abraham again praise the Lord amen
[1:01:42] and you will and you will realize that
[1:01:46] it always goes with darkness
[1:01:51] because there was darkness came and a
[1:01:56] deep sleep fell on Abraham which of
[1:01:59] course will read few coats were better
[1:02:02] Brannon commented on them we were try to
[1:02:04] close our or I was subject with those
[1:02:08] but as we look at that and we and we
[1:02:11] look at at Egypt and what was happening
[1:02:15] being in Egypt there's another scripture
[1:02:18] also and they lied to that kind of a
[1:02:22] caught my attention praise the Lord
[1:02:25] are we together amen amen
[1:02:31] I mean a darkness that can be fair
[1:02:35] praise the Lord
[1:02:37] even darkness which may be felt God said
[1:02:40] I'm going to put darkness and a darkness
[1:02:44] that will be felt praise the Lord you
[1:02:50] know and we we talking about base and
[1:02:53] just like I said you were we may never
[1:02:57] know you know the feelings that are in
[1:03:01] the heart of meaning that are going
[1:03:03] through this I mean beautiful crystal
[1:03:06] people and some of them we ask the
[1:03:08] question why do I ask why I have to be
[1:03:11] this time you know they will have it
[1:03:13] they will have a question that will I
[1:03:15] mean they will trouble their faith in
[1:03:18] God I mean they are going to ask
[1:03:21] question upon question and some of their
[1:03:23] question will never be answered in this
[1:03:25] life praise the Lord because this is
[1:03:29] coming I mean it's coming it's really
[1:03:32] coming home with many families most
[1:03:34] especially when people will I mean lost
[1:03:37] in the loved ones we know we know that
[1:03:39] we all might go by the weight of you
[1:03:42] know the gate of death if the Lord Jesus
[1:03:44] tarried but just not to be able I mean
[1:03:47] to give their last respect I mean to be
[1:03:50] able to gather with family and friends
[1:03:53] and celebrate the homegoing of a loved
[1:03:56] one it can be felt praise the Lord it
[1:04:00] can be felt many work in their way it's
[1:04:03] true Edea the gallery
[1:04:05] means of their loved ones in different
[1:04:07] things now just like I said we might
[1:04:10] never know the kind of a feeling that
[1:04:12] many are dealing with but beyond this
[1:04:15] also there is an inner darkness that
[1:04:19] many are also dealing with it's a
[1:04:22] spiritual darkness praise the Lord
[1:04:25] sometimes people come on the the you
[1:04:28] know the the shadow of the world why I
[1:04:30] say the shadow of the word because it
[1:04:33] takes light and darkness to project a
[1:04:36] shadow when a person is dealing with a
[1:04:39] dark path they can come in in they can
[1:04:43] come and confront the word they can come
[1:04:45] and come you know in contact with the
[1:04:47] truth of God's Word now because there is
[1:04:50] a darkness that is that is dwelling
[1:04:53] within and I mean and whether is India
[1:05:00] spear arena I mean in India to train or
[1:05:04] is India spirit room as I said and if it
[1:05:08] comes in contact with the word it going
[1:05:11] to cast a shadow and sometimes I mean
[1:05:15] looking at the shadow can give the
[1:05:18] person an idea and you can say all world
[1:05:20] I think God brought me through this
[1:05:22] because of a reason God brought me
[1:05:24] through this but you see the thing about
[1:05:26] it there is that back into Genesis when
[1:05:29] the light of God appeared darkness was
[1:05:32] upon the face of the deep but when the
[1:05:35] light of God appeared a casted darkness
[1:05:38] away praise the Lord
[1:05:41] amen in the light of God's Word the
[1:05:45] light of the Holy Spirit the light of
[1:05:47] the message of the hour the purpose of
[1:05:50] slide is to cast every darkness and when
[1:05:53] darkness of feared darkness of doubt
[1:05:57] darkness of the past this light of God
[1:06:00] must cast it away and that's what Isaiah
[1:06:03] said arise and shine
[1:06:05] because your light has come amen
[1:06:09] you cannot stay you cannot walk in this
[1:06:12] light and beholding darkness within
[1:06:15] there is no same darkness
[1:06:18] that can stop this light if a person
[1:06:22] will be hauling a darkness of the past
[1:06:25] or a darkness in their life is because
[1:06:28] you have not opened a window for the
[1:06:30] light to shine true but if you open the
[1:06:32] window of your heart and your mind and
[1:06:34] the light of God shine true is going to
[1:06:37] cast that darkness away God has not
[1:06:40] called us to walk in shadows he had
[1:06:43] called us to walk in the light as he is
[1:06:46] in the light the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:49] cleanses us from all sin
[1:06:51] amen praise the Lord
[1:06:58] well somebody might have pressed my body
[1:07:05] just now praise the Lord Amen glory be
[1:07:12] to God but well in common is it but one
[1:07:16] I was looking at the service you know a
[1:07:18] didn't know that we we were doing some
[1:07:21] work at the church hisses he says wow it
[1:07:23] looks like you preaching in a cloud you
[1:07:31] say your back is all while I told you
[1:07:34] were in the car that's a while but one
[1:07:36] especially he was teasing me in a little
[1:07:40] bit well praise the Lord now X to the
[1:07:52] chapter 14
[1:07:55] so chapter 14
[1:08:11] now Pharaoh has seen the hand of God
[1:08:16] and he have cried to Moses one time he
[1:08:20] told Moses get it from my face don't
[1:08:23] come back to mean again I don't want to
[1:08:24] hear nothing about that God you are
[1:08:26] talking about he says I don't want to
[1:08:28] see your face again Moses said okay you
[1:08:32] my face you will not see again
[1:08:34] praise the Lord after the darkness came
[1:08:36] and the Angel of Death Star to strike
[1:08:39] the lane he was the one that sent for
[1:08:41] Moses Moses was not coming to him again
[1:08:46] to say let my people go
[1:08:47] he was the one that sent for Moses now
[1:08:50] the scripture says here in exit of 14 in
[1:08:53] a time of the accident they have started
[1:08:56] moving out the Bible say verse 19 and
[1:08:59] the angel of God which went before the
[1:09:02] camp of Israel removed and went behind
[1:09:07] him and and the pillar of cloud went
[1:09:12] from before their face and stood behind
[1:09:16] him and it came between the camp of the
[1:09:25] Egyptian and the camp of Israel and it
[1:09:31] was a cloud of Darkness unto them praise
[1:09:38] the Lord but it gave light by night to
[1:09:44] this which was the children of Israel so
[1:09:46] that the one cam that saw that the one
[1:09:51] came not now the order or the night
[1:09:55] praise the Lord
[1:09:57] men watch this now the Bible says here
[1:10:03] that the the the pillar of fire which
[1:10:07] was by night was the same pillar of
[1:10:11] cloud by day it just it just became a
[1:10:13] cloud the light went into the cloud so
[1:10:16] it became a cloud by day and by night it
[1:10:19] was a pillar of fire but what I want us
[1:10:21] to too
[1:10:22] to grab here is that a came between the
[1:10:26] camp Hebrew let's go to the book of
[1:10:30] Hebrew Hebrew chapter 4 verse 12 the
[1:10:49] scripture says for the word of God is
[1:10:52] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:10:56] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:11:00] dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[1:11:05] praise the Lord
[1:11:07] now I'm taking the pillar of fire that
[1:11:10] came between the camp as the word of God
[1:11:14] that that that you know that the heart
[1:11:18] the abilities are dividing asunder that
[1:11:21] comes between the spirit and the soul
[1:11:23] like it like the scripture says here
[1:11:25] just like because we know that a pillar
[1:11:27] of fire was was God I was moving in a
[1:11:30] camp and the word that we have today the
[1:11:33] word that we're reading in the Bible the
[1:11:36] word that we listening to on Ted is God
[1:11:38] in printed form the same with a pillar
[1:11:41] of fire when between the camp of the
[1:11:45] Egyptian and the cam of Israel that is
[1:11:48] the same where the word of God is
[1:11:50] shopping a to edge of sward and it can
[1:11:53] cut right the dividing line it's able to
[1:11:56] separate us from anything of the past
[1:12:00] it's able to cut things from our spirit
[1:12:03] called things we might remember it but
[1:12:06] we don't have the effect we cannot feed
[1:12:11] an effect on us we cannot feed that
[1:12:14] effect of the darkness of the past
[1:12:16] that's what the Holy Ghost we do that's
[1:12:19] what the true Word of God will do and we
[1:12:23] cut us from the effect of the past the
[1:12:28] memory of the past will be there but the
[1:12:30] effect of the past will be gone
[1:12:33] praise the Lord
[1:12:35] amen so just like how the pillar of fire
[1:12:40] went between the Egyptian in Israel kept
[1:12:45] them in kept the Egyptian in darkness
[1:12:48] and it was projecting light to the
[1:12:50] children of Israel that is the same
[1:12:53] thing that the Word of God would do
[1:12:54] praise the Lord
[1:12:55] that's the same thing that the Word of
[1:12:58] God would do amen
[1:13:02] we have we have a promise amen
[1:13:09] we stay have the injurer of the Lord in
[1:13:12] our camp the one that discern our knees
[1:13:17] is the word of God shepherd in a
[1:13:20] two-edged wall descend our tots the
[1:13:23] intents of our heart the word knows our
[1:13:26] needs this word is not just a black and
[1:13:31] white on paper this world we are talking
[1:13:33] about is Jesus Christ that is coming out
[1:13:36] of the pages of the book and he's
[1:13:39] meeting us in a personal experience oh
[1:13:42] that's the reason why we cannot
[1:13:44] overemphasize on the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost
[1:13:48] touch not the oil and annoyed and and
[1:13:50] the wine in the oil its care for a group
[1:13:53] of people praise the Lord amen the Holy
[1:14:00] Spirit rebuke that Antichrist spirit in
[1:14:03] that church age and said don't touch it
[1:14:05] you know you might you might you know
[1:14:08] say a ballad for a week give a false
[1:14:10] interpretation here tell people to buy
[1:14:13] and their place in purgatory in order
[1:14:16] there but when it comes to that truth
[1:14:18] anointing don't touch it
[1:14:20] amen a darkness that can be felt praise
[1:14:28] the Lord we are not called to death that
[1:14:33] is not our promise amen
[1:14:36] God did with our darkness and that's
[1:14:40] what brother Branham said there
[1:14:42] happening over in Genesis chapter 15 he
[1:14:47] said God proved to Abraham that he was
[1:14:51] the one that had to take care of
[1:14:52] everything everything of the past he was
[1:14:55] going to take care of it everything of
[1:14:57] the future he would take care of it if
[1:15:01] we would just believe praise the Lord
[1:15:05] amen he says if we will just believe
[1:15:10] everything of the past everything of the
[1:15:13] future calling of Abraham 1955 he said
[1:15:18] yea all is marvelous he kept the bird
[1:15:22] off of it until the Sun went down notice
[1:15:26] then a deep sleep fell on Abraham the
[1:15:31] first thing Abraham I'm just going to
[1:15:35] shut you off to assure you there is now
[1:15:40] one thing you can do about it
[1:15:42] praise the Lord yes Abraham they're
[1:15:46] making this little effort and driving
[1:15:49] the birds away then driving the birds
[1:15:51] away and you know doing his little
[1:15:53] effort against my battles doing his
[1:15:56] little effort against weakness of the
[1:15:58] flesh but he came to a place were deep
[1:16:02] sleep just fell on him do you know that
[1:16:05] feeling I mean you just they're trying
[1:16:08] to read your Bible God so loved the
[1:16:11] world and deep sleep just fall and the
[1:16:20] good thing the Bible just fall right on
[1:16:21] your face my goodness that's when God
[1:16:30] moves upon the face of the water oh man
[1:16:37] praise the Lord he says and this is my
[1:16:41] coveting and it wasn't one thing brother
[1:16:45] that you could do about it
[1:16:48] it is in one thing sister that you done
[1:16:51] about it is what God did for you in
[1:16:54] Christ now because you was good now
[1:16:59] because of our mother that was good but
[1:17:03] what Christ was good and Christ did he
[1:17:07] did by calling you and what Christ did
[1:17:10] by calling you amen he says put him to
[1:17:13] sleep now he was he hasn't got anything
[1:17:17] to do with it so after he went to sleep
[1:17:21] then there came a rear deep horrible
[1:17:25] darkness praise the Lord
[1:17:29] after God has already sake you like a
[1:17:33] scripture said he gave his beloved sleep
[1:17:36] he gave his beloved Abraham put him to
[1:17:41] sleep he says then a horrible darkness
[1:17:44] what did that mean hell separation every
[1:17:48] sinner deserve it separation he says and
[1:17:51] then beyond that was a burning furnace
[1:17:54] death separation hell after death to
[1:17:57] every sinner but then beyond that when a
[1:18:03] little white light amen
[1:18:08] I hope you never disbelieve no more from
[1:18:13] this hour I hope you see there amen
[1:18:17] praise the Lord just like how the the
[1:18:21] pillar of fire or the pillar of cloud
[1:18:23] went between the camp of the Egyptian
[1:18:27] and the cam of Israel that was just how
[1:18:30] this little library Branham says in the
[1:18:33] midst of the darkness a little I just
[1:18:36] went right between the sacrifice praise
[1:18:41] the Lord
[1:18:45] Abraham asleep and in a vision showing
[1:18:51] that every man must come to this
[1:18:53] horrible darkness of separation dead
[1:18:56] there's that every man deserve to go to
[1:19:00] hell cause
[1:19:02] he's a sinner he fell he is the
[1:19:06] offspring of a sinner and then beyond
[1:19:09] there when the little white light in
[1:19:13] other word the same pillar of fire they
[1:19:17] follow Israel amen
[1:19:20] the same pillar of fire that went

[1:19:25] cam of Israel I seen pillar of fire
[1:19:28] he says that follow Israel the same holy
[1:19:31] spirit this year tonight that is here
[1:19:35] today the symbolic spirit that is
[1:19:37] keeping us praise the Lord
[1:19:42] we Bela put value on this thing that we
[1:19:47] have received like I'm saying you don't
[1:19:50] know what is the inner feeling of many
[1:19:54] that are going through this you don't
[1:19:57] know what the feeling is we listen to
[1:20:00] the news we listened to toto whatever we
[1:20:03] listening to about the inner feeling
[1:20:05] that many are having in this time you
[1:20:09] don't know what it is why because that
[1:20:12] little light has sprung in your heart
[1:20:17] can you imagine that some needs to to to
[1:20:22] inject your body for them to feel happy
[1:20:26] some need to put themselves on some kind
[1:20:29] of a medication for them to get just
[1:20:33] just feel happy what it takes to make
[1:20:37] you happy just singing a song do you
[1:20:42] think it's just easier for everybody
[1:20:44] oh we
[1:20:50] to be grateful we have to be grateful we
[1:20:55] might not have what this world have on
[1:20:57] the outside but what God has given us
[1:21:00] inside there was nothing can replace it
[1:21:03] or you did not work for it is a free
[1:21:06] gift nothing you did about it at this
[1:21:09] LaFell all we have no idea of the
[1:21:19] darkness that many are feeling they can
[1:21:22] put their mind around it some wealthy
[1:21:27] people that have all their money stuck
[1:21:29] in in I mean in the word economy in the
[1:21:36] word investment they have all all your
[1:21:40] life I mean they plan for their family
[1:21:42] they playing all their life in one night
[1:21:47] it's all gone
[1:21:49] you don't know there is no way the
[1:21:53] children of Israel who explain what the
[1:21:58] Egyptian was feeling a darkness where
[1:22:01] you can't even see your way through you
[1:22:05] can't even see the next person standing
[1:22:07] before you
[1:22:08] nothing makes sense and that's where the
[1:22:13] word is today that's where the word is
[1:22:19] that's where the word economy is that's
[1:22:22] where the word scientist is they have
[1:22:25] invested the alive and invested all the
[1:22:27] aesthetic now one illness has come up in
[1:22:31] a world where such comma adjust it yet
[1:22:33] through all the aesthetic through the
[1:22:34] window they are feeling it oh that is
[1:22:42] the reason why we can just I mean feed
[1:22:45] our minds with the thing on the internet
[1:22:47] and just laugh and just relax and order
[1:22:50] that we can get into that can you
[1:22:59] imagine traveling with Israel
[1:23:03] they are going on feet you are hearing
[1:23:06] terrorist sounds you are seeing that
[1:23:09] dust in the end of the Cheras of the
[1:23:12] Egyptians that are coming after you you
[1:23:15] are seeing the dust in the air you are
[1:23:17] hearing the wheels on the ground you
[1:23:23] know what why make those people were
[1:23:24] crying and there no grave that we must
[1:23:28] die like this because you just thought
[1:23:31] that those Egyptian would just ride over
[1:23:33] them and that was the command that that
[1:23:36] Pharaoh gave his soldier ride over them
[1:23:40] don't grab them by the hands don't stop
[1:23:42] them run them over with the charrids
[1:23:50] here shake that cloud just came down
[1:23:55] they can hear the noise they can see the
[1:23:59] dust that is in a we can hear it on the
[1:24:02] media of the hundreds of people that I
[1:24:06] affected with this we can we can see the
[1:24:09] dust we don't have the liberty you have
[1:24:12] the Holy Ghost does not make you in and
[1:24:14] different from people that don't have
[1:24:15] the liberty you have to respect it you
[1:24:19] have to respect the law you know I was I
[1:24:21] was looking at this the other day
[1:24:23] reading the news there's a preacher
[1:24:24] there some more in a country he defy the
[1:24:32] staying home open his church and you
[1:24:35] know what happened he died from from
[1:24:40] from the illness there's another young
[1:24:43] girl when this was just coming up she
[1:24:46] went on social media and she posted that
[1:24:48] she has the cover now Dean I mean and
[1:24:51] she going around in the in in the
[1:24:53] grocery store touching people and
[1:24:55] telling them she has to cover nothing
[1:24:56] she thought she was joking what she died
[1:24:59] for me
[1:25:07] so this is not a jokey thing it's not a
[1:25:10] thing to pull every joke from the
[1:25:12] internet and just laugh about it it's
[1:25:14] not funny it's not funny the serious if
[1:25:22] God has been gracious unto us we must we
[1:25:27] must appreciate it and the evidence of
[1:25:33] the Holy Spirit the evidence of you
[1:25:35] appreciating what God has done for you
[1:25:37] you'll be on your knees praying for
[1:25:39] others it's a sign that you are real
[1:25:43] into the place word you are appreciating
[1:25:45] what God has done for you I thought
[1:25:49] about the heiress's Isis Isis what what
[1:25:53] wrong did he did what wrong he did by
[1:25:55] opening his church what was the wrong
[1:25:58] the wrong was he did not had the wisdom
[1:26:02] of God praise the Lord to know that this
[1:26:07] was not a science thing this was not a
[1:26:09] China thing this was something that that
[1:26:12] was the entire world was evolved and
[1:26:17] when the entire world is evolved and we
[1:26:21] know that a hint of God is behind it
[1:26:26] praise the Lord
[1:26:27] we know that the hand of God is behind
[1:26:30] it
[1:26:32] you never know the darkness that people
[1:26:38] are feeling on the church religion some
[1:26:46] of them this soul sees I mean they can
[1:26:48] sow a million-dollar tide and he can
[1:26:51] they can give money into all of these
[1:26:53] mega church but yet there is a darkness
[1:26:56] that is India heart there is a darkness
[1:27:03] that is India heart there is a song that
[1:27:06] rebirth sank and and when he tell his
[1:27:10] testimony he said in a song that he sang
[1:27:14] this is what the author is for he
[1:27:18] he was struggling over what once was a
[1:27:22] habit they have now become a word of
[1:27:25] life for him and he had that darkness
[1:27:28] within and he was struggling but yet he
[1:27:33] will not say to anybody
[1:27:35] he talked that was what the author for I
[1:27:38] go to the author that confess my sins
[1:27:40] and as you just go away
[1:27:43] what happened is that you just come in
[1:27:46] contact with light and the light and
[1:27:49] darkness mix will always project a
[1:27:52] shadow and sometimes we take that shadow
[1:27:57] to be salvation no salvation is light
[1:28:01] it's a for light it's a full life of
[1:28:04] Christ that is living in a believer it's
[1:28:07] not a shadow life you never know the
[1:28:16] darkness that people under the church
[1:28:22] system feeling they love the Lord they
[1:28:29] read a Bible they know they know that
[1:28:31] this is just not enough Sunday church is
[1:28:35] not enough singing in the choir is not
[1:28:37] enough there is just something more
[1:28:39] there is just something you know that
[1:28:42] there is something they can look at
[1:28:46] their own life not people that would sit
[1:28:49] down under the message and make excuses
[1:28:51] of living wrong just because the thing
[1:28:55] they have believed believe the Prophet
[1:28:57] you are just living a shadow life you
[1:28:59] have a light that is the message of the
[1:29:01] hour but there is a darkness that is in
[1:29:03] your heart that needs to go away if you
[1:29:08] are really accepting this life if you
[1:29:11] are really align this life to shine
[1:29:13] through you it will blow every form of
[1:29:16] Darkness away we can call the Prophet
[1:29:20] and sometimes our mind is so weakened
[1:29:23] give us an opportunity or somebody to
[1:29:26] step on our toes and see the kind of
[1:29:29] things that we would do see the things
[1:29:31] that would come from our mouth
[1:29:32] we are caught in a profit of the age do
[1:29:38] you know that those songs of the profits
[1:29:40] they have an idea that Elijah was going
[1:29:42] to rapture but it never had the the the
[1:29:46] the power of Elijah they only had a
[1:29:49] knowledge of the rapture they only had
[1:29:53] the knowledge of the rapture but it
[1:29:56] never had a double portion timing and
[1:29:59] knowledge of the rapture having a
[1:30:00] knowledge of the messenger it's not
[1:30:02] enough this message is the light of God
[1:30:06] and there is enough light in this thing
[1:30:08] to blow every form of Darkness away what
[1:30:12] are a darkness of tradition the darkness
[1:30:15] of creed a darkness from some kind of a
[1:30:18] familiar spirit this message of the hour
[1:30:20] this light of God is able to blow every
[1:30:24] darkness away if you are feeling the
[1:30:31] form of darkness is because you using it
[1:30:35] too high you are using it too high if
[1:30:39] you just open the window praise the Lord
[1:30:44] just open the window let the Sun let the
[1:30:46] sunlight of gosh on through your house
[1:30:49] brother Branham says how can a man deny
[1:30:52] that there is light they tell him that
[1:30:54] the sun is shining outside he goes down
[1:30:55] in his basement he close said I don't
[1:30:57] believe it he closed the window I don't
[1:30:59] believe there is light house that I saw
[1:31:01] doc he just closed all the windows
[1:31:04] praise the Lord
[1:31:06] I think I'm glad I need to stop a stud
[1:31:10] jumping or order these things so song
[1:31:16] I'm looking for windows to close better
[1:31:18] Jody but that was the thing I was
[1:31:26] thinking about brother sketch a kind of
[1:31:28] a darkness that people are feeling and
[1:31:31] we want to blame the message and we want
[1:31:35] to blame God why I'm a god we now open
[1:31:39] in the window to God's Word we now open
[1:31:42] in our heart we are so stuck in our
[1:31:45] ways we can come in contact with the
[1:31:49] light we rejoice with thank God we
[1:31:51] enjoyed our feeling and that warmness of
[1:31:54] the light and then we just slip back
[1:31:56] into our darkness slip back into our
[1:32:01] dark path dark ways Jesus's men love
[1:32:12] darkness more than light I mean with all
[1:32:19] the things he was doing raising their
[1:32:21] dead healing their sake and this is the
[1:32:24] promise of the Messiah that was given to
[1:32:26] them yet they enjoy
[1:32:30] korrina's singing a son my God my god
[1:32:35] waha God forsaken me my God my God
[1:32:40] yeah singing the psalm of David and the
[1:32:43] word is fulfilled right before their
[1:32:45] eyes they are thinking the psalm of
[1:32:51] David and the word is fulfilled right

[1:32:56] there to set them free eliminate their
[1:32:58] mind brighten their spirit writing their
[1:33:06] spirit that's the reason why a man or

[1:40:09] himself aligned the light of God who
[1:40:11] goes through you as far as you know
[1:40:13] there must not be anything that should

[1:40:53] struggle to get in this now it's hard to
[1:40:56] get out a me and he says no this the
[1:41:00] first thing that every man has nothing
[1:41:04] to do with God taking Abraham plumb out
[1:41:07] of his senses kicking out of his senses
[1:41:12] don't reason it don't think about it
[1:41:16] that's right he was asleep he mean you
[1:41:28] know what that sleeper means to the
[1:41:30] believer jesus told his disciples he
[1:41:34] says let's go over to Lazarus for his
[1:41:36] lipid there were means death to sing
[1:41:42] amen it's word we put the flesh to sleep
[1:41:48] and then yeah a horrible fear dread
[1:41:55] comes on him that's death do that every
[1:42:02] every one he says and then he looked who
[1:42:06] was the sacrifice and when he did he saw
[1:42:10] a smoking Phonics every sinner deserve
[1:42:14] to go to hell that's right and then he
[1:42:20] noticed beyond that when a little white

[1:42:30] went right in between every piece of
[1:42:34] this animal
