[55:38] to him less than nothing in vanity all
[55:41] nations before the lord told to whom
[55:44] then will ye lacking god

[59:59] [Applause]
[1:00:01] we will
[1:00:03] want to take a little
[1:00:05] subject
[1:00:07] this morning i was actually thinking
[1:00:09] about i was going to speak on the depths
[1:00:11] of god and the depths of satan and but
[1:00:16] while i was studying i got i got uh
[1:00:20] uh
[1:00:21] i got driven into
[1:00:23] into church history that was i've been
[1:00:26] i've been uh kind of uh
[1:00:28] reading a lot of church history during
[1:00:31] the week
[1:00:32] and you see uh uh
[1:00:34] uh just like we were reading and we all
[1:00:38] know
[1:00:38] you know uh
[1:00:41] history
[1:00:43] you know reminds us
[1:00:45] you know of things that have passed and
[1:00:48] and if we
[1:00:49] if we uh uh get ourselves into reading
[1:00:52] history you realize that just like
[1:00:56] solomon said there is nothing new under
[1:00:58] the sun
[1:00:59] what has happened is is what is
[1:01:01] happening
[1:01:03] and and when you get yourself into
[1:01:05] church history and you read about the
[1:01:07] church fathers and and all of that
[1:01:10] and you look at the date and the time
[1:01:12] that we are living in you realize it's
[1:01:15] just the same old thing repeating just
[1:01:17] different people being involved amen
[1:01:20] praise the lord
[1:01:22] so this morning i would take a talk that
[1:01:25] i will i would entitle
[1:01:27] the cycle of revival and death
[1:01:30] i want to talk on the cycle of revival
[1:01:34] and death
[1:01:35] and that's the reason why i read that
[1:01:37] scripture where isaiah said that god set
[1:01:40] upon the cycle
[1:01:42] of
[1:01:42] the universe he sit upon the cycle of
[1:01:45] the earth
[1:01:47] and uh
[1:01:49] i want to i want to talk about the cycle
[1:01:53] of
[1:01:57] the cycle of revival
[1:01:59] and death
[1:02:01] and why and while looking at while
[1:02:04] looking at that there were few other
[1:02:05] things also that
[1:02:08] caught my attention
[1:02:12] and
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:14] i want to
[1:02:18] uh
[1:02:23] i realized there were there was some men
[1:02:25] there that wrote about the cycle of
[1:02:28] nations
[1:02:29] now if you watch the cycle of nations
[1:02:33] and uh and you and you look into that i
[1:02:36] mean i was like i said i was reading a
[1:02:38] lot of those things
[1:02:40] and and i
[1:02:42] kind of
[1:02:44] copied some of them
[1:02:46] that
[1:02:47] we will we will project
[1:02:50] and and you will see the trench of
[1:02:52] thought when you when you look at that i
[1:02:55] mean uh
[1:02:56] uh uh many years back there there are
[1:02:59] men
[1:03:00] that have been they have been looking at
[1:03:02] how the leadership of the nation's been
[1:03:04] going you know and and the people you
[1:03:07] know and and the economy and all of that
[1:03:11] and as as they look at what is happening
[1:03:13] in the present time and go back and read
[1:03:16] in history to realize that you know it's
[1:03:18] just something that is you know uh uh
[1:03:21] you know revolving it keeps it keeps
[1:03:23] happening it's in a cycle
[1:03:25] so uh some men that wrote about the
[1:03:28] cycle of nation you know
[1:03:30] elizano tyler he wrote the cycle of
[1:03:33] democracy in
[1:03:35] in 1770
[1:03:38] you know uh
[1:03:41] and then in 1778 there's another guide
[1:03:44] edward that also wrote about the the
[1:03:47] decline and the fall of the roman empire
[1:03:51] and then another person wrote about this
[1:03:55] called the study of history
[1:03:57] and and but what i showed he was looking
[1:03:59] at also was you know
[1:04:02] the cycle of nations
[1:04:04] and then
[1:04:08] in 1936 another person wrote about the
[1:04:12] story of civilization
[1:04:14] and jim nelson black wrote when nations
[1:04:17] died in 1994
[1:04:21] and in all of these
[1:04:23] a historical account of how men
[1:04:26] have looked at just like i said that the
[1:04:29] nations you know when things are
[1:04:31] happening you know and and they have
[1:04:33] been able to come and when you when you
[1:04:35] read through these things you realize
[1:04:37] that they are all aiming at the same
[1:04:41] thing they are all driving to the same
[1:04:43] place to show that there have been
[1:04:45] cycles you know nation goes through
[1:04:48] cycles people go through cycles you know
[1:04:51] we go through cycle of life you know uh
[1:04:54] uh
[1:04:55] uh every seven years you know there is
[1:04:58] there's there is there is changes that
[1:05:00] take place in our life that's that's our
[1:05:02] cycle
[1:05:04] you know so uh
[1:05:05] uh
[1:05:07] we have we have 10 cycles to get off the
[1:05:10] clock
[1:05:14] praise the lord
[1:05:16] three scores and 10.
[1:05:19] when we go to round 10 cycle we're
[1:05:21] supposed to get off the clock
[1:05:23] but god has given grace to some to stay
[1:05:26] on the clock after 10 cycles
[1:05:28] praise the lord so you see
[1:05:32] and just like how the nations go through
[1:05:35] cycles and people go through cycles the
[1:05:38] church to also go through the cycle
[1:05:41] of revival
[1:05:43] and death
[1:05:45] praise the lord
[1:05:47] amen
[1:05:54] and
[1:06:05] jim nelson black he wrote he said
[1:06:09] in his book the nate
[1:06:11] when nation died
[1:06:14] he point out
[1:06:15] the three
[1:06:17] decay of a nation
[1:06:20] the three major things
[1:06:22] that kill
[1:06:23] a nation
[1:06:26] he point out
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:29] social
[1:06:30] decay and on the social decay
[1:06:35] he pointed out the crisis of
[1:06:37] lawlessness
[1:06:41] he's he also pointed out on a social
[1:06:43] decay
[1:06:45] the the loss of uh
[1:06:48] economic discipline
[1:06:53] the loss of economic discipline
[1:06:56] and the rise of bureaucracy
[1:07:00] those are some of the the things
[1:07:03] that destroy the nation social wise
[1:07:06] when people start becoming
[1:07:09] you know
[1:07:11] lawlessness they don't have
[1:07:13] no value
[1:07:15] for courtesy they don't have no
[1:07:18] traditional values
[1:07:19] they don't they just don't have value
[1:07:22] for anything
[1:07:23] not even themselves
[1:07:25] you also point out
[1:07:27] cultural decay
[1:07:30] the decline
[1:07:32] of education
[1:07:34] when the educational system
[1:07:36] start declining
[1:07:39] you know we know there was a big turn
[1:07:41] turn in that
[1:07:43] in the 1960s when he took the bibles out
[1:07:46] of school
[1:07:47] it it
[1:07:48] just it just
[1:07:50] shrinked the entire
[1:07:52] cultural system
[1:07:55] and uh
[1:07:56] uh
[1:07:58] i mean when when when you know when
[1:08:01] education
[1:08:02] uh
[1:08:04] decline in in young people are not
[1:08:07] taught
[1:08:08] morals and that taught courtesy
[1:08:12] and respect
[1:08:14] you can just
[1:08:15] you can just see the kind of a future
[1:08:18] that that would be for the generation to
[1:08:20] come
[1:08:21] the weakening of
[1:08:23] cultural foundation
[1:08:26] the bible says solomon says do not
[1:08:28] remove the old
[1:08:30] the ancient landmark
[1:08:33] you know
[1:08:34] it was not only talking about our
[1:08:36] cornerstone on our property but the
[1:08:40] ancient landmark was a
[1:08:43] principle
[1:08:45] that the early follow the early fathers
[1:08:47] have planted
[1:08:49] you know
[1:08:51] and then the loss of respect
[1:08:54] for traditional values that also go back
[1:08:57] to the asian landmark so when the nation
[1:09:00] lost these three things we don't have a
[1:09:02] culture
[1:09:05] we don't have a culture
[1:09:07] praise the lord
[1:09:09] when the nation loves these things you
[1:09:11] cannot be able to tell
[1:09:14] who have just come in and who have been
[1:09:16] here all this why
[1:09:20] praise the lord because sometimes it's
[1:09:23] the culture of the people that tell us
[1:09:26] who owned the land
[1:09:28] who have been here
[1:09:31] and then he also point out moral decay
[1:09:35] social decay cultural decay and moral
[1:09:38] decay
[1:09:40] the rise of immorality
[1:09:46] the decay of religious belief
[1:09:51] praise the lord
[1:09:52] amen
[1:09:54] when
[1:09:55] when when when just
[1:09:57] when just the respect
[1:09:59] the sacredness
[1:10:01] of worship places is no longer to people
[1:10:04] you know people can walk into the church
[1:10:07] and you know they want to smoke their
[1:10:09] weed they want to you know bring guns
[1:10:11] and kill people
[1:10:12] when all of those things have gone from
[1:10:14] the society
[1:10:16] there is no morals
[1:10:21] hospitals and churches
[1:10:24] used to be safe heaven
[1:10:27] for a nation
[1:10:33] when a man no matter how evil he is if
[1:10:37] he's able to run over to a a hospital
[1:10:41] for the father he got to the hospital
[1:10:43] means that he needs attention he needs
[1:10:46] help
[1:10:51] praise the lord
[1:10:52] amen for the father he runs into the
[1:10:55] door of a church
[1:10:57] means that
[1:10:58] he needs help
[1:11:00] it used to be safe heaven but is no
[1:11:03] longer
[1:11:04] animal safe heaven
[1:11:12] and human life has been
[1:11:16] devalued
[1:11:17] there is no value for human life
[1:11:21] praise the lord
[1:11:22] we see there on our news every day all
[1:11:25] the road rages that is taking place
[1:11:29] i will advise you pray behind your will
[1:11:31] before you get to driving
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:36] just pray behind your wheels and keep
[1:11:38] christ on your mind
[1:11:41] because uh
[1:11:42] it's just it's just becoming on an
[1:11:45] everyday thing
[1:11:47] you know and and i mean some of those
[1:11:49] things are just crazy you just you just
[1:11:51] see
[1:11:52] how lord we have become
[1:11:56] and is a global thing it's not only an
[1:11:59] american thing it's a global thing
[1:12:02] you find in every word there is no value
[1:12:04] for human life
[1:12:06] you know they can destroy the male life
[1:12:08] just over a piece of bread
[1:12:14] the decade of religious belief and the
[1:12:17] rise of immorality
[1:12:20] destroy the morals
[1:12:22] of every nation
[1:12:24] and every people
[1:12:27] praise the lord
[1:12:34] and our so
[1:12:38] sorry my mind uh mine uh uh
[1:12:42] okay brother jordan can you switch this
[1:12:44] light off
[1:12:49] i don't know if if it makes any
[1:12:51] any clarity to you but just put up the
[1:12:54] cycle of nations for me now i want to
[1:12:57] use that
[1:12:58] as
[1:13:14] praise the lord
[1:13:16] are we together
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:22] now alexander tyler was the one that uh
[1:13:27] that uh
[1:13:30] that publicized this cycle
[1:13:34] of nations
[1:13:38] and
[1:13:39] in instead in the cycle of nations
[1:13:42] he says we come from bonnage
[1:13:46] and
[1:13:48] i don't have your super pain yet but
[1:13:50] jordan but that's okay we comes from
[1:13:52] bonnage and then we goes to spiritual
[1:13:56] uh faith
[1:13:58] and then uh from there we go to courage
[1:14:01] and then liberty now as i was as i was
[1:14:04] reading this i i try to put in
[1:14:07] one of the easier picture is the
[1:14:09] children of israel
[1:14:11] you know you just put it in you just put
[1:14:13] it
[1:14:14] put it in the picture for you to be able
[1:14:16] to see it you know if you can if you can
[1:14:18] be able to grab a scriptural
[1:14:20] uh
[1:14:21] uh grab a scriptural picture you will be
[1:14:24] able to understand
[1:14:26] uh the children of israel you know uh uh
[1:14:29] there in egypt was in bondage
[1:14:32] then brother brahm talks about aaron
[1:14:34] praying
[1:14:35] you know uh when when the uh when the
[1:14:38] burden was increased
[1:14:41] you know spiritual faith started
[1:14:43] building you know bondage will always
[1:14:46] create some sense of spiritual faith
[1:14:48] when people are just deprived and people
[1:14:52] are just low to the bottom they make
[1:14:54] them to cry out to go oh god if you save
[1:14:57] me i will save you the rest of my life
[1:15:05] bondage will always
[1:15:07] create some sense of spiritual faith
[1:15:11] they will be going to church
[1:15:13] sleeping in the church
[1:15:19] amen
[1:15:21] then there will be a sense of courage
[1:15:26] that spiritual faith will start building
[1:15:29] a sense of courage
[1:15:36] are we together
[1:15:39] and and right here
[1:15:41] under this courage you will see
[1:15:44] that's where it took moses to kill an
[1:15:46] egyptian
[1:15:51] okay
[1:15:52] it was a whole lot of courage
[1:15:55] to do that
[1:15:58] because what was happening there
[1:16:01] now the uh uh the hebrews in some sense
[1:16:05] started started resisting the tax master
[1:16:10] oh i said i said bill the i said i said
[1:16:12] beat the break
[1:16:13] what if you kill me and i would just die
[1:16:17] you know it will take courage for you to
[1:16:19] stand before someone that is suppressing
[1:16:21] you and and you know and respond back to
[1:16:24] them
[1:16:31] and then right after courage
[1:16:33] comes liberty
[1:16:35] moses gone in the wilderness
[1:16:38] they came back
[1:16:40] here in the era
[1:16:43] and
[1:16:45] let my people go
[1:16:50] let my people go
[1:16:53] now as we as we go through this as we
[1:16:55] talk this
[1:16:57] i want us to apply to our own lives
[1:17:03] because we also to go through
[1:17:06] this cycle
[1:17:10] we go through this cycle
[1:17:14] so labor time
[1:17:15] you can you can you can uh uh uh put a
[1:17:19] sinner right in the bound and sin
[1:17:22] and then whether he hears somebody
[1:17:24] preaching the gospel or he visit the
[1:17:26] church a sense of spiritual faith starts
[1:17:28] to come he starts getting courage to go
[1:17:30] to church every day and and and then
[1:17:33] pretty soon he get a touch from god he
[1:17:34] feels a sense of liberty
[1:17:37] then the next thing that comes is
[1:17:39] abundance
[1:17:44] praise the lord
[1:17:46] and as soon as abundance comes
[1:17:50] then people stop being complacent
[1:17:58] the lord
[1:18:00] we start becoming complacent
[1:18:03] now just like i said uh uh uh this is
[1:18:07] this is uh
[1:18:09] you know
[1:18:10] if you study history
[1:18:13] you will realize there was something
[1:18:14] that you know that i realized
[1:18:17] you bring it down even to the church
[1:18:19] ages
[1:18:21] you realize that in the 1700s look up
[1:18:24] look at the map of the church ages when
[1:18:26] the church ages reign
[1:18:28] you will find out that uh
[1:18:33] that age that is honored the man's
[1:18:35] anointing
[1:18:37] that was the age where god inspired men
[1:18:43] okay it came it came right down to the
[1:18:45] to the time of the printing press
[1:18:50] you know all of these things for us to
[1:18:53] have papers for us to have books and now
[1:18:56] we are getting away from paper and books
[1:18:58] we are getting over to you know uh uh
[1:19:01] high tech and everything is the cloud
[1:19:04] and all of that but there was a period
[1:19:06] of time
[1:19:07] were
[1:19:08] god used
[1:19:11] what was happening at that time
[1:19:14] go and find great literature
[1:19:17] you will find that men in the 1700s
[1:19:23] because they were all under the men's
[1:19:25] anointing
[1:19:27] they had such an insight
[1:19:32] and and and i mean
[1:19:33] they were on the the age to publicize
[1:19:39] and most of those most of those men
[1:19:41] wrote great books
[1:19:44] praise lord i mean great great writers
[1:19:47] came out of that that age because it was
[1:19:49] the anointing that was on the edge
[1:19:54] the anointing where men took their pain
[1:19:56] in right
[1:20:06] and because it was under the anointing
[1:20:08] it was inspired
[1:20:10] that's the reason why the man can write
[1:20:12] this in 1700s and we can look at it and
[1:20:14] say oh wow
[1:20:16] wow that's truth
[1:20:18] wow i can see it
[1:20:21] that's what inspiration does
[1:20:28] so after complacency
[1:20:30] man gets to that place of complacency
[1:20:32] and right in there we start to feel a
[1:20:36] little sense of entitlement
[1:20:41] you know we start to feel a little sense
[1:20:43] of entitlement but what happened here is
[1:20:46] that as we as we go up
[1:20:50] as we go up
[1:20:52] there are changes that are taking place
[1:20:56] that we no longer feel
[1:21:00] the the the pressure that we used to
[1:21:02] feel yeah in bunach
[1:21:07] now when we got over to spiritual faith
[1:21:09] there was some sense of desperation
[1:21:11] because we had just come from out of
[1:21:13] bondage we become so desperate so
[1:21:16] zealous
[1:21:20] but then when we get
[1:21:22] to complacency
[1:21:24] you don't find that anymore
[1:21:26] yet in bondage we were not sleeping very
[1:21:28] long but yeah now we oversleep
[1:21:33] you know we oversleep
[1:21:35] and even we start taking pills to sleep
[1:21:37] more
[1:21:45] because we have arrived
[1:21:54] praise the lord
[1:21:58] then after a complacency you can see the
[1:22:01] cycle i want to go into that into the
[1:22:04] church
[1:22:05] you know into church
[1:22:07] history a little bit because it involves
[1:22:11] us
[1:22:12] we
[1:22:13] we are in uh
[1:22:15] the time of the gentiles
[1:22:17] the laodicea church age scripture wise
[1:22:19] that's where we find ourselves
[1:22:22] so
[1:22:23] uh then man comes down to empathy
[1:22:26] and then after
[1:22:28] not too long
[1:22:30] he's back to become
[1:22:33] to dependency
[1:22:36] at one time he had abundance
[1:22:40] but now
[1:22:41] he comes down here
[1:22:44] to dependency
[1:22:48] and according to history
[1:22:50] it takes 200 years
[1:22:52] for a nation to go through that cycle
[1:23:02] praise the lord
[1:23:05] amen
[1:23:13] so we
[1:23:14] we want to
[1:23:19] we want to look at that this morning we
[1:23:21] want to talk on
[1:23:23] the cycle of death the cycle of revival
[1:23:26] and death we want to dwell mostly on the
[1:23:29] cycle
[1:23:30] the the cycle that we go through the
[1:23:32] cycle of life that we go through but
[1:23:35] because we're bringing it from uh church
[1:23:37] history
[1:23:39] you you
[1:23:40] that's the reason why we want to we want
[1:23:42] to use that
[1:23:43] as the as a cycle of death i was sitting
[1:23:46] back there this morning and listening to
[1:23:50] what was streaming play
[1:23:51] for the church ages
[1:23:53] and and i talked to myself i said i said
[1:23:56] i said lord
[1:23:58] i wish the people are learning from what
[1:24:00] they are listening to
[1:24:03] i hope they are listening and they are
[1:24:04] picking things that can stay on their
[1:24:06] mind and they can go back and look at it
[1:24:08] into the church book and look at it into
[1:24:10] the scripture
[1:24:12] praise the lord
[1:24:13] because those things are very important
[1:24:16] this morning their brother bran was
[1:24:18] talking about where uh where we have
[1:24:21] this whole uh
[1:24:22] uh
[1:24:23] virgin mary thing that have come into
[1:24:26] the church and become a big thing of the
[1:24:28] catholic church how it was a roman
[1:24:31] history
[1:24:32] before it became part of the church it
[1:24:34] was actually a roman history
[1:24:38] you know it was something that that rome
[1:24:41] brought and the church
[1:24:42] embraced and now it's a big thing among
[1:24:46] catholics in that that leads the people
[1:24:49] into
[1:24:50] idolatry and all of that
[1:24:52] you know so we we we look into those
[1:24:55] things and you know we learn you know we
[1:24:57] learn we must always have a heart to
[1:24:59] learn
[1:25:00] praise the lord
[1:25:02] so as we look at that you will realize
[1:25:05] the other let me let me find my little
[1:25:08] uh cheat sheet here
[1:25:10] i was i was writing some things down
[1:25:13] uh in office
[1:25:14] while i was i was meditating
[1:25:17] and i wa let's go to our bibles
[1:25:22] thank you brother jordy if we want to re
[1:25:24] we refer back to this we will ask your
[1:25:26] help
[1:25:30] praise the lord
[1:25:35] if you can give us some light here
[1:25:40] praise the lord
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:52] as chapter 2.
[1:25:54] now as as we look at this subject
[1:25:56] together what what i want to bring also
[1:25:59] here is the other if you look in the
[1:26:02] scripture you will realize that the
[1:26:04] church
[1:26:06] the church
[1:26:12] studied
[1:26:13] is is its very foundation
[1:26:16] is very foundation
[1:26:18] what i want us to go through is to look
[1:26:20] at a few scriptures in the bible where
[1:26:23] it talks about the church in the house
[1:26:26] because that's the very foundation of
[1:26:29] the church
[1:26:32] the foundation of the church is the home
[1:26:36] praise the lord
[1:26:38] amen
[1:26:39] the foundation of the church is the home
[1:26:43] but we term to get it in a reverse
[1:26:49] is what we are in our homes that we
[1:26:52] bring together on sunday
[1:26:57] that's the very foundation so you will
[1:26:59] see that the early church
[1:27:02] in the beginning they started from from
[1:27:05] house to house
[1:27:08] as we look a few scriptures here as
[1:27:10] chapter 2 verse 46 let's just run
[1:27:13] through through those ones
[1:27:15] quickly
[1:27:17] 2 46
[1:27:21] and
[1:27:22] and they continue daily we've won a call
[1:27:26] in the temple and breaking bread from
[1:27:30] house to house now you see that the the
[1:27:34] container wanna call in the temple now
[1:27:36] the temple year
[1:27:37] you will realize that the early church
[1:27:41] was was made out of jewish believers
[1:27:46] so in one sense they will stay attached
[1:27:50] to their temple stay attached to the
[1:27:52] synagogues
[1:27:55] praise the lord but pretty soon they
[1:27:57] will realize they have the people in the
[1:27:59] synagogues is not is not embracing them
[1:28:06] pretty soon they will realize that they
[1:28:08] are under persecution they are looking
[1:28:09] for them and now they are going to they
[1:28:12] are all going to sink back now
[1:28:14] to this house to house
[1:28:17] fellowship
[1:28:20] we want to call in the temple breaking
[1:28:22] bread from house to house
[1:28:25] they eat their meat with gladness and
[1:28:28] singleness of heart
[1:28:30] let's look at uh as chapter eight
[1:28:35] as chapter eight verse three
[1:28:41] as chapter 8 verse 3
[1:28:52] as for saul
[1:28:54] he made a havoc of the church
[1:28:58] entering into every house
[1:29:04] he made a havoc of the church
[1:29:07] entering into every house so because it
[1:29:11] was known that the early church the
[1:29:13] believers were gathering from house to
[1:29:16] house
[1:29:18] so
[1:29:20] that's how saul when when he took uh the
[1:29:24] commission to persecute the church
[1:29:26] started going from house to house
[1:29:29] persecuting the
[1:29:31] disciples
[1:29:33] praise the lord i throw in another
[1:29:35] scripture year
[1:29:36] uh that will that will back that up but
[1:29:39] let's let's stay in the book of acts and
[1:29:40] then we will come to that one as chapter
[1:29:43] 20 20
[1:29:45] as chapter 20. say 2020
[1:29:52] i might have got it wrong or wrote it
[1:29:53] wrong or so
[1:30:00] as chapter 20 20
[1:30:05] there's a reason why
[1:30:08] how i kept back nothing that was
[1:30:10] profitable unto you
[1:30:14] but uh have shown you and have taught
[1:30:17] you publicly and from house to house
[1:30:21] so that was paul
[1:30:23] talking to the efficient editors
[1:30:26] uh one of the last time he would talk to
[1:30:29] them first timothy chapter 3
[1:30:32] verse five okay let's leave that one
[1:30:36] let's leave to matthew chapter three
[1:30:37] verse five
[1:30:38] i know why i put that there
[1:30:42] now in first timothy chapter three verse
[1:30:44] five is where paul was talking about the
[1:30:46] qualification of a deacon if a man would
[1:30:49] not be able to keep his house
[1:30:52] now so you see the way they were
[1:30:54] choosing their deacons is because they
[1:30:57] were seeing how the how you know how the
[1:30:59] family was ordering themselves in their
[1:31:02] in their home
[1:31:04] you know how a man was taking the
[1:31:06] responsibility of his home and bringing
[1:31:09] his home under the hair ship of the
[1:31:11] world the way his uh his children was
[1:31:14] you know you know so from there they
[1:31:16] were being able to get so that's what i
[1:31:18] kind of dash that one in but let's go to
[1:31:20] romans chapter six romans chapter 16
[1:31:23] verse five and uh first corinthians 16
[1:31:26] verse 19
[1:31:28] uh uh
[1:31:29] you know and paul is greeting all of
[1:31:31] these churches in the house of this
[1:31:33] person in the house of aqualia and
[1:31:36] priscilla in the house the church in the
[1:31:38] house the church in the house the church
[1:31:40] in the house now so it it gives you the
[1:31:44] sense
[1:31:45] of how the home is the foundation of the
[1:31:50] church
[1:31:51] praise the lord is the backbone let me
[1:31:54] say that way is the backbone of
[1:31:57] the
[1:31:58] church
[1:32:01] praise the lord
[1:32:02] so uh uh uh
[1:32:05] now
[1:32:07] from this you will realize that uh
[1:32:10] the the the the gathering of having uh
[1:32:14] uh church building in in the sense of uh
[1:32:17] you know how we appreciate church
[1:32:18] building today
[1:32:20] actually
[1:32:21] came
[1:32:22] uh after the time that constantine has
[1:32:25] got himself involved with the church
[1:32:27] you know when he got himself involved
[1:32:29] with the church just to be able to get a
[1:32:33] control of the people you know uh the
[1:32:37] they offer them
[1:32:39] buildings for them to come together and
[1:32:42] also it was in the time of i think king
[1:32:45] gregory
[1:32:46] when
[1:32:46] the state decided to now stop paying
[1:32:50] the preachers
[1:32:53] there was actually word uh uh uh you
[1:32:57] know preachers started getting on on
[1:32:58] salary
[1:33:00] you know in the in the in the book of
[1:33:02] arts there you know the like the
[1:33:05] scripture says you know
[1:33:07] delayed their gifts are the apostles
[1:33:09] feet
[1:33:10] now all of that was at a time where
[1:33:13] state and church
[1:33:15] starts to merge
[1:33:19] the state was trying to get hold of the
[1:33:22] church
[1:33:23] and detect i was just reading in in in
[1:33:26] the office just before i came out of of
[1:33:29] uh one of the king wu's wives among his
[1:33:32] many wives one day and she was the hair
[1:33:35] wife and and she was a christian so what
[1:33:38] she did was she built
[1:33:40] uh a monastery right beside the palace
[1:33:44] and and and and she brought in preachers
[1:33:47] to preaching and and then when she died
[1:33:51] the king wept out the monastery
[1:33:55] because she was a queen she had she had
[1:33:57] the power to do that
[1:34:04] are we together
[1:34:06] so there was a time where the state got
[1:34:09] a hold of the church
[1:34:11] and uh uh
[1:34:14] you know and and and i mean
[1:34:16] we are rolling right back into that
[1:34:20] we are rolling right back into that
[1:34:23] so you see all of that so there's that
[1:34:25] the concept that i want i'm trying to
[1:34:27] bring here with
[1:34:29] the church being the home being the
[1:34:31] backbone of the church is the other we
[1:34:34] come together we sing the songs we
[1:34:36] fellowship the preacher preached the
[1:34:38] word but now it's up to us to take that
[1:34:40] word
[1:34:41] take it home
[1:34:43] meditate upon it
[1:34:45] raise our family
[1:34:47] in the fear of the lord
[1:34:49] praise the lord
[1:34:51] amen
[1:34:52] raise our family because
[1:34:54] i won't see you again until wednesday
[1:34:56] night if jesus is tired and he give us
[1:34:58] another wednesday that's when we will be
[1:35:00] yet and then after wednesday service we
[1:35:02] don't come back again until sunday now
[1:35:05] so uh uh
[1:35:07] i mean that it will not be justice for a
[1:35:10] man to hold the pastor response
[1:35:12] responsible for his children misbehaving
[1:35:14] when it when they only come on wednesday
[1:35:16] and sundays
[1:35:20] you have the responsibility take the
[1:35:22] word that being preached to you and
[1:35:24] establish it in your home build family
[1:35:27] artists fellowship around the world
[1:35:36] are we together
[1:35:39] now so we see we see those things happen
[1:35:43] you know we see those things happen so
[1:35:45] we we get into
[1:35:47] into our our subject here
[1:35:51] praise the lord i'm trying to take my
[1:35:53] time this morning
[1:35:56] because i i woke up
[1:36:01] around four o'clock this morning with
[1:36:03] such a headache on my head
[1:36:05] i just have a kind of a headache but uh
[1:36:09] you know i just i just thank the lord
[1:36:11] how
[1:36:12] you know i just you know kind of for
[1:36:13] waiting there and seeing what how the
[1:36:15] grace of god would help us so i was i
[1:36:18] was just saying wow
[1:36:20] where this kind of a strong head came
[1:36:22] from this morning you know but uh we
[1:36:25] thank the lord that we can
[1:36:27] we can be able to draw strength from him
[1:36:30] so i would take my time this morning
[1:36:34] it shouldn't stop you from pulling amen
[1:36:37] i've always tell you if i died i know
[1:36:39] you can raise me up
[1:36:41] i believe in the church that can raise
[1:36:43] me up amen
[1:36:45] praise the lord amen
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:49] so let's let's take efficient church age
[1:36:51] here and re read a little bit here let's
[1:36:54] take this first i'm having love from
[1:36:56] ephesians church age but the cycle of
[1:36:59] revival and death
[1:37:02] never fail
[1:37:04] that's what i took my inspiration from
[1:37:06] the cycle
[1:37:08] that cycle of revival and death never
[1:37:11] fail
[1:37:12] all you have to do is recall this last
[1:37:16] move of god in the spirit
[1:37:18] when men and women dressed like
[1:37:20] christians went to church pray all night
[1:37:24] talk to the street colonels
[1:37:26] and wearing a shame of the manifestation
[1:37:29] of the spirit
[1:37:32] they left they are all their churches
[1:37:35] and and and and and worship in homes or
[1:37:39] all store buildings
[1:37:43] they had to build
[1:37:46] find new churches no
[1:37:51] they have reality
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:55] but it wasn't too long a time until they
[1:37:59] begin to get enough money to build fine
[1:38:02] new churches
[1:38:05] they put in the choir instead of singing
[1:38:08] unto god for themselves
[1:38:12] and gowns on the choir they organized a
[1:38:15] movement in
[1:38:16] and and rendered by men they soon
[1:38:20] began to read books
[1:38:22] that weren't fit to read
[1:38:25] they let down the bar the goats come in
[1:38:27] and took
[1:38:28] over the cry of joy was gone so you if
[1:38:33] you go back to our cycle again you see
[1:38:35] how
[1:38:36] how they left from from bonnage
[1:38:40] and and and then pretty soon now they
[1:38:42] have got themselves back to this place
[1:38:44] again praise the lord
[1:38:47] we will look at that in a little bit
[1:38:49] here
[1:38:50] the crowd of joy is gone the freedom of
[1:38:52] the spirit is gone oh
[1:38:54] they kept
[1:38:56] on with a form but the fire had died
[1:38:59] down
[1:39:01] and the black the blackness of arches is
[1:39:04] about
[1:39:05] all that is left
[1:39:08] amen
[1:39:09] they can only talk about how i was on
[1:39:12] fire
[1:39:13] how this place was on fire
[1:39:15] praise the lord
[1:39:17] but all that is left is just the
[1:39:19] blackness and arches
[1:39:24] are we together amen
[1:39:27] so we see that uh uh you know uh uh
[1:39:31] uh history tells us that these things do
[1:39:35] happen
[1:39:36] and just like i said it happens in
[1:39:38] church life it happened in family life
[1:39:40] it happened in individual lives
[1:39:46] we go through those cycles
[1:39:49] praise the lord
[1:39:51] amen but you see the move of god in
[1:39:54] every age is to break the cycle
[1:39:59] praise the lord
[1:40:01] is to break the cycle
[1:40:02] now the concept there from from the
[1:40:05] prophet isaiah of how the law sits on
[1:40:09] the cycle of the earth he's not in the
[1:40:12] cycle he's out of the cycle
[1:40:18] praise the lord
[1:40:19] he's out of the cycle so it takes the
[1:40:22] one that is out of the cycle to break
[1:40:24] the cycle
[1:40:28] and that is the reason why in every age
[1:40:31] god raised up a man we can talk about
[1:40:34] the time of moses we used that right
[1:40:36] there in our cycle they were in bunachi
[1:40:39] and and all of that a man grew courage
[1:40:42] and he went down there and saw uh uh uh
[1:40:46] uh
[1:40:47] two i mean
[1:40:49] an egyptian fighting with an israelite
[1:40:52] it was it was a lot of courage for him
[1:40:54] to stand stand uh
[1:40:56] against a slave master and challenge him
[1:40:58] if you hit me with that thing i would
[1:41:00] knock you back well you can kill me but
[1:41:02] i will hit you back if you touch me one
[1:41:03] more time and moses saw that and says
[1:41:06] enough is enough praise the lord he got
[1:41:08] down there and he slayed the man and
[1:41:10] dragged him in the sand and pretty soon
[1:41:12] he went in the backside of the desert
[1:41:14] but courage brought liberty
[1:41:16] because a man took courage
[1:41:21] it brought liberty amen
[1:41:24] and when the people were were freed
[1:41:28] praise the lord
[1:41:29] if you can just dash our our cycle back
[1:41:32] cycle the mission back on on when the
[1:41:34] people were freed
[1:41:36] what happened
[1:41:38] they went right into abundance
[1:41:41] the pillar of fire by by night the
[1:41:44] pillar of cloud by day
[1:41:49] amen
[1:41:54] they went from bondage spiritual faith
[1:41:56] courage
[1:41:58] he's too against the egyptian
[1:42:01] moses brought liberty
[1:42:03] let them across the red sea into
[1:42:05] abundance
[1:42:09] man of falling in the morning just take
[1:42:10] the basket take as much that you can
[1:42:15] when we're eating uh the still bread in
[1:42:18] egypt now they have choice
[1:42:21] oh no i don't want this one i don't want
[1:42:23] this one i don't want this one and they
[1:42:25] take and even they take more that they
[1:42:27] can't even finish
[1:42:30] that's what happened abundance
[1:42:32] brings greed yes
[1:42:39] praise the lord
[1:42:43] and they're going through that cycle
[1:42:46] now they have abundance
[1:42:49] praise the lord
[1:42:51] so now they became complacent
[1:42:55] they have all the time to sit down with
[1:42:58] korra and dayton and plot against moses
[1:43:03] they are now complacent they have all
[1:43:04] the time on their hands
[1:43:06] and who he think he is
[1:43:09] who you think he is moses aaron is this
[1:43:12] thing is this family thing now
[1:43:16] praise the lord
[1:43:18] when they had the whips of the egyptian
[1:43:20] on their back
[1:43:22] amen oh
[1:43:25] seeing one another was so precious to
[1:43:28] them
[1:43:32] praise the lord
[1:43:33] now the in the wilderness there is no
[1:43:36] egyptian band that is waking them up in
[1:43:38] the morning they can sleep and snore
[1:43:45] drew from their mouth to their feet
[1:43:47] they have all the time to sleep
[1:43:50] and i want to wake up oh what a good day
[1:43:54] oh what a good day
[1:43:59] i just hate to get outside it's moses
[1:44:02] again
[1:44:07] i don't know he thinks he's some kind of
[1:44:08] a commander
[1:44:11] he gave instruction to people oh my
[1:44:13] goodness
[1:44:15] when he come to him say i'm sleeping
[1:44:17] i'm sleeping
[1:44:20] you have all the time to sleep
[1:44:30] may god help us
[1:44:36] let's take another one from the ephesian
[1:44:37] church age
[1:44:39] have you ever studied
[1:44:41] the history of revival
[1:44:44] if you have not try
[1:44:47] you will enjoy it
[1:44:50] now a revival signify the move of god in
[1:44:53] spirit
[1:44:55] for every time
[1:44:57] god moves
[1:44:58] satan is there to move also
[1:45:01] it never fails
[1:45:04] praise the lord
[1:45:05] it never
[1:45:07] fails
[1:45:08] so you realize that right in that cycle
[1:45:11] as things are happening
[1:45:15] it's a move that is taking place as we
[1:45:17] go into every stage
[1:45:23] are we together
[1:45:25] it never fails
[1:45:27] in the days of the great
[1:45:31] revival
[1:45:34] and most people don't know this
[1:45:38] because you see
[1:45:41] why people while most people don't know
[1:45:43] this is because oh my goodness there is
[1:45:46] something i wanted to include in here
[1:45:48] but uh
[1:45:49] uh i did not put it put it in my notes
[1:45:53] i would have really loved to include it
[1:45:55] in here
[1:46:00] uh
[1:46:06] well okay we might have another time to
[1:46:08] share that with you
[1:46:10] but uh uh uh what why people
[1:46:14] did not realize what was happening in in
[1:46:16] the welsh revival is because
[1:46:19] people
[1:46:20] were only looking at uh
[1:46:23] you know uh uh uh the the positive side
[1:46:28] of the revival they're looking at how
[1:46:31] many people got saved you know how i
[1:46:33] mean it was it was such a powerful
[1:46:35] revival you know if history can record
[1:46:38] it is because it affected the it
[1:46:41] affected the the welsh people they
[1:46:42] affected the nation you know and in all
[1:46:45] our time i mean men were traveling over
[1:46:47] there to
[1:46:48] to uh to see the move of god
[1:46:51] most people don't know this the insane
[1:46:54] asylum filled up quickly
[1:46:58] and there was
[1:47:00] a great display of devil powers to take
[1:47:03] away the attention from god
[1:47:06] praise the lord
[1:47:08] amen
[1:47:10] now what i wanted to share with you uh
[1:47:12] it was it was uh uh brett brown was
[1:47:14] talking about the ram he was talking
[1:47:17] about
[1:47:18] you know all of these men that
[1:47:21] that were great poets and great writers
[1:47:23] he was talking about the power of
[1:47:26] inspiration
[1:47:28] how these men when when when they get
[1:47:31] under inspiration and it is the
[1:47:33] inspiration of the almighty god how it
[1:47:36] lift them so high
[1:47:38] they get to the place like see david
[1:47:41] prophesy my god my god
[1:47:44] what have that forsaken me he's saying
[1:47:46] the very same exact word that jesus was
[1:47:51] saved hundreds of years on the cross
[1:47:57] praise the lord
[1:48:00] he's saying those exact words which mean
[1:48:03] god had lifted him up
[1:48:05] in the spirit so much
[1:48:09] that he's saying word for word
[1:48:14] and he talks about man that has great
[1:48:16] gifts and people that have been used
[1:48:19] under the power of inspiration he says
[1:48:22] what happened is that when a man is
[1:48:24] sticking up into that spirit and and and
[1:48:27] i mean he he's been he's been
[1:48:30] lifted above his mortar ability he gets
[1:48:34] into the supernatural and he starts to
[1:48:37] write things it's a fountain filled with
[1:48:39] blood drained from emmanuel vain and and
[1:48:41] all of these men all through the ages
[1:48:43] even sometimes preacher you preach all
[1:48:46] the inspiration just to that place you
[1:48:49] know to that level
[1:48:51] he says what happened
[1:48:53] is that
[1:48:56] there is
[1:48:58] the man is down here
[1:49:01] on the frame
[1:49:03] that place of the supernatural is up
[1:49:05] here in the tail level
[1:49:07] he sits right here in the middle
[1:49:10] there is a rain
[1:49:12] now most times when men are lifted up in
[1:49:15] the spirit
[1:49:17] and they don't have the grace
[1:49:19] to be able to come down
[1:49:22] they get caught up right here right in
[1:49:24] the middle here
[1:49:26] he says that's where sometimes they lose
[1:49:28] their mind
[1:49:32] praise the lord
[1:49:33] amen
[1:49:35] that's where they lose their mind now
[1:49:36] because i just like apostates
[1:49:40] and and he calls it on the prince of the
[1:49:43] power of the earth
[1:49:46] praise the lord
[1:49:48] there's a reign there's a dimension
[1:49:50] right in between
[1:49:52] between the two the airflow where where
[1:49:54] we are uh uh you know uh uh under this
[1:49:57] uh three dimension
[1:49:59] and there is we can say four dimension
[1:50:02] now and and but but there is a reign
[1:50:04] here that we will call you know the the
[1:50:07] the fifth dimension also
[1:50:09] you know and and sometimes when men are
[1:50:12] not able to to get back to themselves
[1:50:14] you know he talks about
[1:50:16] you know the one that wrote the fountain
[1:50:18] filled with blood how after being under
[1:50:21] inspiration he took a bleeding you know
[1:50:23] and and and committed suicide and and
[1:50:26] you know he talks about uh
[1:50:30] even even jonah you know being on a such
[1:50:34] an inspiration to bring an entire nation
[1:50:37] to repentance
[1:50:40] and at the end
[1:50:45] he was asking god to take his life
[1:50:50] i rather died you know i mean these
[1:50:52] people you said you were going to do
[1:50:54] this and all of that so that's that's
[1:50:56] what he was talking here and now
[1:50:58] when the move of god like brother
[1:51:00] branham was talking about all of these
[1:51:01] people that were caught up in
[1:51:04] in the the the
[1:51:07] insane east institute you know it's it's
[1:51:10] it's people that uh you know you you get
[1:51:13] under the grace of god and and and god
[1:51:16] deeds with the manhattan and the power
[1:51:18] of god is is pawn on the person a person
[1:51:21] is in a revival sitting under the
[1:51:23] preaching of the word the holy ghost
[1:51:25] comes you know and just and just pull
[1:51:27] the spirit of conviction on a man or
[1:51:30] deal with the man heart and all of that
[1:51:32] but what happened is that many times
[1:51:35] people don't have the grace you see you
[1:51:38] get that little experience right in the
[1:51:40] meeting you get aside oh praise god you
[1:51:42] shouted when you have never shouted
[1:51:44] before and you just go under the
[1:51:46] impression that i received the holy
[1:51:47] ghost
[1:51:50] that's dangerous
[1:51:53] that's very dangerous
[1:51:56] praise the lord
[1:51:59] because you have to realize that
[1:52:02] the gates of hell
[1:52:04] reward against you
[1:52:08] every devil in hell
[1:52:11] we want to destroy your confidence in
[1:52:13] that experience you have had
[1:52:17] praise the lord
[1:52:19] amen
[1:52:20] so if if the grace is not there for the
[1:52:22] person to be taught
[1:52:24] that it was a truth experience no doubt
[1:52:27] it was the move of god
[1:52:29] but now you have to be taught
[1:52:32] amen
[1:52:33] like peter says
[1:52:35] the holy ghost fell on those men as
[1:52:37] chapter 10
[1:52:39] he says then who can forbade this one
[1:52:41] from being baptized
[1:52:44] you see he brought them back to the
[1:52:46] principle of the word
[1:52:49] he was oh they received the holy ghost
[1:52:51] mind they are just like us
[1:52:55] no he brought them back to the very
[1:52:58] foundational principle of the world
[1:53:04] are we together
[1:53:07] so let's read this talking here on
[1:53:10] the cycle of revival
[1:53:14] we go through that
[1:53:17] we go through those cycles
[1:53:19] in our life in our christian life
[1:53:24] god
[1:53:27] brings us out of bondage by the by the
[1:53:29] preaching of the word
[1:53:31] by god dealing with the sinner's heart
[1:53:34] praise the lord
[1:53:36] we feel some sense of spiritual faith
[1:53:40] we can read our bible we can get down on
[1:53:43] our needs and pray
[1:53:46] we get some sense of liberty
[1:53:48] things i used to do i do them no more
[1:53:53] praise the lord
[1:53:54] amen
[1:53:57] and pretty soon we start getting to that
[1:53:58] place of abundance
[1:54:00] and when the person gets to that place
[1:54:02] of abundance you start condemning other
[1:54:04] people
[1:54:06] because now you think you read your
[1:54:07] bible you understand you go into a
[1:54:09] church oh my goodness the service was on
[1:54:11] fire all those denominational they are
[1:54:13] they are they're all dead denominational
[1:54:20] praise the lord
[1:54:26] we have never
[1:54:28] never learned
[1:54:30] how to sustain god's blessing
[1:54:33] how to be able to sustain the presence
[1:54:35] of god when it's dealing with you
[1:54:39] how to keep it
[1:54:44] praise the lord
[1:54:51] it is written that in wesley there is
[1:54:53] the people
[1:54:55] who do most peculiar things
[1:55:01] that were definitely of satan to try to
[1:55:04] mark
[1:55:05] the goodness and the power of god
[1:55:08] in in luther day it is said that the
[1:55:11] miracle of his ministry did not lie in
[1:55:14] the fact that he successfully protest
[1:55:17] protested
[1:55:20] the roman catholic church
[1:55:22] but the miracle lays in the fact that he
[1:55:25] could
[1:55:26] and did stay sound
[1:55:29] in the midst of all the fanaticism
[1:55:32] that was around
[1:55:34] praise the lord
[1:55:36] just like i've said to you before men
[1:55:37] like zwingling
[1:55:39] he taught that luther
[1:55:41] he says
[1:55:42] you know he had a great move but he had
[1:55:44] backslided
[1:55:46] you know and he took he took that move
[1:55:50] of of luther revival in such an extreme
[1:55:53] to produce what we have today as the
[1:55:55] amish
[1:55:58] people he took it to such an extreme we
[1:56:02] don't want to have nothing to do with
[1:56:03] the state
[1:56:08] and that's what had produced the amish
[1:56:10] people we have today
[1:56:12] they came right a product from luther's
[1:56:15] revival
[1:56:17] and many of them
[1:56:22] praise the lord
[1:56:24] amen
[1:56:25] even uh
[1:56:27] man of simon you know uh that started
[1:56:29] the the midnight he also was a catholic
[1:56:32] priest
[1:56:34] he went into studying what luther
[1:56:38] received as a revelation
[1:56:41] praise the lord and what he does was he
[1:56:43] says i will not go in a way that
[1:56:45] zwingling is going
[1:56:48] so he tried to grab a balance
[1:56:51] between what luther was preaching and
[1:56:53] what zwingling also was preaching
[1:56:57] so you see
[1:56:59] it's it's history it's a cycle it has
[1:57:01] always been there you'll find man that
[1:57:03] goes right into the messenger's message
[1:57:07] and think that they can preach the
[1:57:08] message more than the messenger
[1:57:14] it has always been like that
[1:57:23] praise the lord
[1:57:28] but in the midst of all of that now
[1:57:30] people thought
[1:57:31] that luther
[1:57:33] was actually creating a revolution
[1:57:36] against the state
[1:57:39] no he was not against the state he was
[1:57:41] against what the church was preaching
[1:57:44] that was not in line with the word
[1:57:49] praise the lord
[1:57:50] so when the state led to
[1:57:53] give luther an offer
[1:57:55] of a job people thought well he
[1:57:58] backslided
[1:58:00] he has backslided
[1:58:03] you see the thing the thing is keeping
[1:58:06] with god's word
[1:58:09] it's not starting a revolution against
[1:58:12] the state or again one group of people
[1:58:15] no stay with the world
[1:58:17] because those things
[1:58:19] can only last for a moment
[1:58:24] but the word will never fail
[1:58:29] the word of god will never fail
[1:58:38] are we together
[1:58:46] now so we see here
[1:58:49] luther was able to keep himself sound in
[1:58:51] the midst of all the financing that was
[1:58:53] going around
[1:58:58] and if you have been aware of of the
[1:59:01] last his ministry
[1:59:04] you will have noted the same invasion of
[1:59:07] false and wicked spirit
[1:59:10] that's the invasion of the devil
[1:59:14] he creeps in
[1:59:15] under the quietness
[1:59:17] of the holy ghost
[1:59:20] creed creep in all of the quietness
[1:59:23] of the holy ghost
[1:59:25] and find a seat
[1:59:27] that is called the seat of the scumfall
[1:59:32] he sits there and resent everything
[1:59:35] and scoff at the word
[1:59:38] praise the lord
[1:59:41] amen
[1:59:45] that's the invasion of the enemy
[1:59:54] praise the lord
[1:59:56] amen you know it will be a beautiful
[1:59:59] thing
[2:00:01] if a child takes their bible
[2:00:04] and read and then come
[2:00:05] to their father and mother and it says
[2:00:07] mama the scripture says
[2:00:10] this bible says this okay
[2:00:14] take for example
[2:00:16] the bible says uh
[2:00:18] paul is there paul there they're either
[2:00:20] inefficient or uh uh
[2:00:25] uh or collusion where he says uh
[2:00:29] parents do not provoke
[2:00:32] your children
[2:00:35] amen
[2:00:36] praise the lord
[2:00:38] but yet also in hebrew he says provoke
[2:00:41] one another
[2:00:45] so you have to look at you you have to
[2:00:47] look at what the apostle is talking
[2:00:49] about
[2:00:51] praise the lord and and and just like i
[2:00:54] said it's it's done in many ways when we
[2:00:57] as parents don't understand that that
[2:01:00] young child needs to grow
[2:01:03] in their understanding of the lord
[2:01:06] and now you want to use your
[2:01:08] understanding and your revelation and
[2:01:10] then you know but the bible said we
[2:01:12] shouldn't do that that the message said
[2:01:14] we shouldn't do this
[2:01:16] now
[2:01:17] it will be
[2:01:19] a beautiful thing for a child now to
[2:01:21] read your bible
[2:01:23] take something in the scripture
[2:01:25] and come to the parent and says
[2:01:28] but dad or mom see the bible says this
[2:01:32] or i was reading this or listening and
[2:01:34] and you know and the message these days
[2:01:36] praise the lord
[2:01:38] that will be a beautiful way where you
[2:01:41] realize that the grace of god is
[2:01:44] beginning to deal with that child
[2:01:47] then for the child now to just sit in
[2:01:51] a stubborn seat
[2:01:55] amen
[2:01:56] they are not saying anything
[2:01:58] but they are saying a lot
[2:02:04] they're not saying anything but they are
[2:02:06] saying a whole lot
[2:02:09] i would just put it in a few words
[2:02:12] however what you are saying
[2:02:15] and get it from my face
[2:02:21] praise the lord
[2:02:23] they have an innocent face looking at
[2:02:25] you
[2:02:28] praise the lord
[2:02:31] it would be a beautiful thing for a
[2:02:33] child to take what that parent said and
[2:02:35] say let me see if this thing is in the
[2:02:37] bible
[2:02:38] when you have all the resources at your
[2:02:41] hand you can take your phone go to
[2:02:43] search put that word in obedient and and
[2:02:47] your search engine will bring you 300
[2:02:50] times obedient is used in the bible
[2:02:54] the laziness
[2:02:55] of not being able to read through it
[2:03:01] praise the lord
[2:03:02] and then if the child can be able to
[2:03:04] find a place in the scripture and says
[2:03:07] and says and says and says papa oh mama
[2:03:10] see what the bible says oh may god gave
[2:03:12] grace to the heart of thy mother all
[2:03:15] grace to the heart of thy father to be
[2:03:16] able to learn
[2:03:18] even if the child is not bringing in the
[2:03:20] right way you must see that the holy
[2:03:22] ghost is dealing with the heart of that
[2:03:23] child to be able to look in the word
[2:03:28] look i'm your father i'm your father you
[2:03:31] do what i says
[2:03:51] praise the lord
[2:03:54] the invasion of evil
[2:03:56] and wicked spirits
[2:04:01] it has to be that way
[2:04:05] now i hope i trust that you are
[2:04:07] spiritual minded enough
[2:04:09] to get there and capture to last on it
[2:04:13] praise the lord
[2:04:16] amen
[2:04:17] the invasion
[2:04:19] of evil and wicked spirit it has been
[2:04:22] there
[2:04:23] in in the cycle of the church what did
[2:04:25] the bible say acety mean
[2:04:28] the bible called it a settlement
[2:04:30] and his wife
[2:04:32] asked chapter five
[2:04:34] didn't give his name they called him a
[2:04:35] setting man
[2:04:38] praise the lord
[2:04:39] i mean in so much that luke never had no
[2:04:42] re record of his name
[2:04:44] because he was this kind of a person
[2:04:46] that showed up in church and we never
[2:04:48] see him again until he show up another
[2:04:50] time
[2:04:52] praise the lord
[2:04:54] but yet
[2:04:59] he was always
[2:05:01] getting home and you know and in
[2:05:04] south africa you see that i think that
[2:05:05] pastor was talking today
[2:05:07] the guy and the team is smart
[2:05:11] they think they're smart
[2:05:15] this is your saying that so we can give
[2:05:16] ourselves to praying and to steady
[2:05:19] they're just lazy
[2:05:21] that people money they won't be living
[2:05:22] on
[2:05:27] they don't got anything this much
[2:05:32] praise the lord
[2:05:37] that we should say all our things and go
[2:05:39] lay our money at their feet
[2:05:45] praise the lord
[2:05:46] so
[2:05:49] forgive me
[2:05:50] i don't know where i'm coming up with
[2:05:52] this thing
[2:05:53] but just forgive me
[2:05:59] we are talking about the psycho
[2:06:03] of revival and death
[2:06:07] the cycle of revival
[2:06:09] and death
[2:06:12] praise the lord
[2:06:14] wednesday night we were talking about
[2:06:15] possessing your vessel
[2:06:18] you know
[2:06:21] because they were not constantly giving
[2:06:23] themselves to the word
[2:06:25] whether in church or at home
[2:06:27] they could not control their
[2:06:29] conversation
[2:06:30] and their tongue
[2:06:32] will cause the death of the settlement
[2:06:35] and the death of his wife
[2:06:42] their tongue
[2:06:45] will cause their death yes sir
[2:06:51] it takes your
[2:06:53] your dedication your submission to the
[2:06:56] world to be able to bring every member
[2:06:59] of your body
[2:07:01] in suggestion
[2:07:04] praise the lord
[2:07:05] if a person is having mind bottles and
[2:07:08] you cannot stop thinking nasty thoughts
[2:07:10] just give yourself to the world
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:15] just read a verse and try to memorize it
[2:07:19] you will realize that every time a
[2:07:21] negative thought is coming to your mind
[2:07:23] that bible verse will pop up
[2:07:25] the word now will start fighting
[2:07:27] thoughts in your mind
[2:07:29] [Applause]
[2:07:33] praise the lord
[2:07:35] amen
[2:07:37] if a man have i mean just just a kind of
[2:07:41] evil desire lost and and i mean you
[2:07:44] always want to be indebted things
[2:07:50] let me say it this way
[2:07:54] just try if i mean if if you just think
[2:07:56] that you just the whole fasting thing
[2:07:59] you can do it
[2:08:01] just give your breakfast just keep
[2:08:03] breakfast let me see that way
[2:08:05] just keep breakfast
[2:08:08] even if it is from nine o'clock
[2:08:10] until 12 just hold yourself a little bit
[2:08:13] before god
[2:08:18] just keep your breath fast and hold
[2:08:20] yourself a little bit before god and say
[2:08:22] god please take this dead spirit from me
[2:08:27] the word
[2:08:28] is the one that fights our battle
[2:08:32] the word is the one that controls that
[2:08:34] made this body so the word has what it
[2:08:37] takes to bring this body on a subjection
[2:08:55] the cycle
[2:08:56] of revival and death
[2:09:03] some
[2:09:05] have experienced god
[2:09:08] in different ways
[2:09:10] in some in great ways
[2:09:14] praise the lord
[2:09:17] but somewhere down the line
[2:09:19] we have got to a place of complacency
[2:09:25] and we no longer pray
[2:09:29] and we think we can pop the bible in our
[2:09:31] minds so we don't need to read the bible
[2:09:33] anymore
[2:09:36] praise the lord
[2:09:42] and the revival of death
[2:09:45] starts to step in
[2:09:47] amen
[2:09:50] the revival of death when you get to
[2:09:52] that place in the cycle of abundance
[2:09:56] but jordan if you can throw that cycle
[2:09:58] up for me again
[2:10:08] praise the lord
[2:10:10] if you get to this place of
[2:10:12] abundance
[2:10:14] this is
[2:10:15] this is a junction
[2:10:18] it's a very serious junction
[2:10:21] in your life you need your own
[2:10:23] importance to help you here
[2:10:25] you need your own importance to lift you
[2:10:28] above the floor
[2:10:29] that comes
[2:10:31] because right here when a man that has
[2:10:34] suffered bonus
[2:10:35] starts to experience bone abundance
[2:10:39] god don't help him he can be arrogant
[2:10:41] very arrogant
[2:10:44] the man that experienced bondage
[2:10:47] when he starts to experience abundance
[2:10:51] if god don't help him
[2:10:53] be disrespectful
[2:10:58] so this is a junction
[2:11:02] where we need your own importance
[2:11:07] to help
[2:11:08] us but bam says at every junction of
[2:11:12] time
[2:11:13] if the people of god can just look in
[2:11:15] history
[2:11:17] that's why he brought seven junctions to
[2:11:19] show us
[2:11:20] if we can just look in history history
[2:11:23] will tell us at every junction of time
[2:11:26] god comes down on the scene
[2:11:29] because
[2:11:30] because the junction is a place of
[2:11:32] decision
[2:11:34] the enemy comes as a
[2:11:36] flaw there are a lot of things that are
[2:11:39] happening
[2:11:42] praise the lord amen
[2:11:45] we need the grace of god
[2:11:47] right here
[2:11:48] to lift us above their abundance
[2:11:52] to lift you above the abundance that it
[2:11:55] will not have effect on you
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:12:00] oh abundance of revelation
[2:12:02] then the man thinks he's next to the
[2:12:04] prophet
[2:12:07] abundance of grace to pray for few
[2:12:09] people in the sake he has a healing
[2:12:11] ministry he want to be the next elijah
[2:12:25] praise the lord
[2:12:30] is a junction
[2:12:32] in time
[2:12:34] when a nation has abundance you know
[2:12:37] another thing that comes with abundance
[2:12:40] abundance
[2:12:42] a create
[2:12:43] a spirit
[2:12:46] a demon of any day
[2:12:49] comes around you
[2:12:51] everybody that sees your abundance
[2:12:53] starts to envy you
[2:12:56] praise the lord
[2:12:58] america came to this place
[2:13:00] one time she was greatly envy by the
[2:13:04] word
[2:13:06] amen
[2:13:07] israel is at this place
[2:13:09] now in israel and all the nations joven
[2:13:13] and all the nations around her invade
[2:13:15] her
[2:13:16] because god has turned her desert to
[2:13:19] blossom like a rose
[2:13:22] praise the lord
[2:13:23] amen
[2:13:25] and this place because you have all of
[2:13:27] those those those uh uh demons of invade
[2:13:30] around you then what happened is that
[2:13:34] like uh america used this now
[2:13:37] to become the police of the world
[2:13:41] because we had we the the nation had
[2:13:43] abundance
[2:13:45] so what happened is the other at the
[2:13:47] moment it says uh you know this nation
[2:13:50] and that nation is is is
[2:13:52] they are fussing with one another then
[2:13:54] we stop in we step
[2:13:56] in and says uh
[2:13:59] stop like the police can blow the
[2:14:01] whistle or the referee the empire you
[2:14:04] know
[2:14:05] praise the lord
[2:14:07] amen that's what abundance would do
[2:14:11] to a man
[2:14:14] praise the lord
[2:14:15] it has a spirit of envy that is warring
[2:14:19] against it
[2:14:21] and then he has a spirit of pride within
[2:14:26] when the spirit of envy appeared
[2:14:30] to your abundance if god don't give you
[2:14:32] grace
[2:14:33] the spirit of pride step out
[2:14:36] now i'm the one that can solve all their
[2:14:38] problems
[2:14:40] if you have a problem just give me a
[2:14:42] call
[2:14:47] praise the lord
[2:14:48] then the spirit of pride
[2:14:51] steps up
[2:14:58] oh glory be to god
[2:15:02] like i said i'll take my time this
[2:15:03] morning i'm i don't have a lot of energy
[2:15:06] but it's not energy we need we need a
[2:15:09] word
[2:15:12] amen
[2:15:18] let's let's let's take another thought
[2:15:19] here as we talk about the cycle of
[2:15:21] revival and death
[2:15:24] efficient age again is another piece
[2:15:26] here from efficient age
[2:15:28] now history keeps repeating itself
[2:15:33] why it keeps repeating itself because
[2:15:35] it's on the cycle
[2:15:37] yes sir
[2:15:39] praise the lord
[2:15:41] if the wheels don't turn on your car you
[2:15:43] don't worry anywhere
[2:15:47] praise the lord
[2:15:48] amen you can pedal all you want if it
[2:15:51] does not turn you are not going anywhere
[2:16:02] or if it's turning in you i mean maybe
[2:16:04] your chain is off or so
[2:16:07] now history keeps repeating itself
[2:16:10] in the generation of israel we see
[2:16:15] we see revival
[2:16:17] in one great generation
[2:16:20] only to see the fire fading in the next
[2:16:24] the book of judges
[2:16:27] will help us to see that in the history
[2:16:29] of israel
[2:16:31] we see revival in one generation
[2:16:35] just to see the fire fading up in the
[2:16:37] next
[2:16:39] because every time that god will raise
[2:16:42] up a judge
[2:16:44] he will raise up a man to deliver the
[2:16:46] people
[2:16:48] it would take not too long
[2:16:51] they will go back
[2:16:52] into complacency
[2:16:58] only to see
[2:17:01] in the tear generation
[2:17:03] an amber
[2:17:05] may be glory
[2:17:07] cycling by in the fourth generation
[2:17:11] there may be
[2:17:12] advantage
[2:17:14] whatever soul
[2:17:16] of the original flame
[2:17:19] then god light the fire again and the
[2:17:22] same process is repeating
[2:17:26] the cycle
[2:17:28] the cycle
[2:17:30] the cycle
[2:17:35] praise the lord
[2:17:44] it is simply the manifestation of the
[2:17:46] truth that god
[2:17:49] has no grandchildren
[2:17:52] praise the lord because what happened is
[2:17:55] that these people that that experience
[2:17:58] the reality of god
[2:18:01] thinks that they can pass it down to
[2:18:03] their children
[2:18:04] by just telling them
[2:18:07] by just telling them they think that
[2:18:09] they can pass that reality down to their
[2:18:11] children by just telling them so verb is
[2:18:14] saying with this cycle it's the truth
[2:18:16] that god don't have grandchildren
[2:18:20] we can pass our experience down
[2:18:23] by lecture
[2:18:25] and testimony
[2:18:27] praise the lord
[2:18:28] amen because jesus christ is the same
[2:18:31] yesterday today and forever
[2:18:35] praise the lord
[2:18:36] amen
[2:18:38] we can talk about uh you know what you
[2:18:41] know what uh with the prophet and you
[2:18:42] know god did when i gave my heart to the
[2:18:44] lord this is what happened all of those
[2:18:46] things are beautiful
[2:18:49] they are beautiful
[2:18:52] sometimes i think
[2:18:55] we
[2:18:56] we dwell on the glory
[2:18:59] we dwell on the glory
[2:19:02] when people
[2:19:04] are in tight us people are struggling
[2:19:07] with habits and things and we are here
[2:19:10] all you know how god filled me with the
[2:19:12] holy ghost and how god did this to me
[2:19:14] instead of getting down there and tell
[2:19:16] the person testifying or how god
[2:19:18] delivered me from lust and how god that
[2:19:21] this man that is struggling down with
[2:19:23] the same can say the god that delivered
[2:19:25] him that same god can bring me
[2:19:31] oh we like to talk about the horsetop
[2:19:34] everybody should see us how wonderful we
[2:19:36] are i mean the lord woke me up at four
[2:19:38] o'clock i woke up i sprayed for two
[2:19:40] hours and other days and and then you
[2:19:42] know and all of that
[2:19:52] verb says tell how the candle got
[2:19:55] lighted
[2:19:57] praise the lord
[2:19:59] maybe that maybe a flame will spark out
[2:20:02] of your testimony and it will light the
[2:20:04] next main candle
[2:20:07] amen
[2:20:12] glory be to god
[2:20:16] god don't have grandchildren
[2:20:18] salvation is not
[2:20:20] passed on by natural birth
[2:20:24] praise the lord
[2:20:28] i have my children in the message what
[2:20:29] does that mean
[2:20:32] praise the lord
[2:20:34] amen what does that mean
[2:20:38] [Music]
[2:20:39] and you see those things and they get it
[2:20:41] in their head they are born in the
[2:20:42] message because we never talk about
[2:20:45] being born again so they take being born
[2:20:47] in the message as being born again
[2:20:52] praise the lord
[2:20:54] if you were talking about the life you
[2:20:56] were in before god gave you the new
[2:20:58] birth when you get born again that child
[2:21:01] is going to capture that thought and
[2:21:03] says i want the same god that my parents
[2:21:06] have
[2:21:12] praise the lord
[2:21:14] how i used to lie and how i used to stay
[2:21:19] how i used to run around and god got a
[2:21:22] hold of me
[2:21:24] praise the lord
[2:21:30] god don't have no grandchildren
[2:21:33] praise the lord
[2:21:34] he want to bring them through the same
[2:21:36] birth that he brought you through
[2:21:38] give them the same experience that he
[2:21:40] gave to you
[2:21:45] praise the lord
[2:21:50] such things has killed it has killed
[2:21:52] family life
[2:21:54] praise the lord because the the the
[2:21:57] parish you see the thing about it there
[2:21:59] is that you don't know i don't know how
[2:22:01] god is dealing with this brother or
[2:22:03] dealing with this brother i want to know
[2:22:05] how god is dealing with me and that's
[2:22:07] the same thing you don't know how god is
[2:22:09] dealing with your children
[2:22:10] so you cannot take your experience
[2:22:13] for their experience
[2:22:27] salvation is not passed by natural birth
[2:22:29] anymore
[2:22:31] then there is a truth in apostolic
[2:22:33] succession
[2:22:36] amen
[2:22:37] people that think because i was ordained
[2:22:39] by this person this person was ordained
[2:22:41] by this person this person was ordained
[2:22:42] by this person means that i'm in the
[2:22:45] truth praise the lord
[2:22:47] you can have god call man
[2:22:50] it was jesus that sent out his disciples
[2:22:54] and judas was among them
[2:22:56] when he commissioned them
[2:22:58] but yet he became the devil
[2:23:04] so no matter who lay hands on you
[2:23:07] not the one that lay hands on your head
[2:23:10] is the one that lay hands on your heart
[2:23:12] that matters
[2:23:20] it is in the word
[2:23:23] you start out with truly born again
[2:23:26] believers
[2:23:27] and when the next generation comes along
[2:23:30] they are no longer
[2:23:33] just plain christians
[2:23:37] you hear people say well you know
[2:23:40] it's our time to enjoy
[2:23:42] we suffer for this gospel
[2:23:46] praise the lord
[2:23:48] they just show where they're on the
[2:23:49] cycle
[2:23:52] amen
[2:23:53] this is our time to enjoy
[2:23:56] we suffer for this gospel let me tell
[2:23:58] you
[2:23:59] those days
[2:24:03] praise the lord
[2:24:04] the devils of those days have not they
[2:24:06] are not dead yet
[2:24:11] amen they are not dead they have just
[2:24:13] become enforced
[2:24:22] we suffer for this message
[2:24:29] may god help us
[2:24:32] may god help us
[2:24:34] praise the lord
[2:24:36] when one generation come along they are
[2:24:38] no longer
[2:24:40] plain christians
[2:24:42] but
[2:24:43] but they
[2:24:44] they have taken a denominational name
[2:24:47] and now they have baptisms of melody etc
[2:24:50] that's exactly what they are too
[2:24:54] they are not christians
[2:24:56] you have to be born of the word of god
[2:25:01] not of the word of man to be safe
[2:25:06] praise the lord
[2:25:08] amen
[2:25:11] oh my
[2:25:16] now so you see all of that you look you
[2:25:19] look through
[2:25:20] the the you know uh the the history of
