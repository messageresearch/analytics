[1:01:02] daughter sister beveling been doing
[1:01:04] everything to make sure that her dad is
[1:01:06] okay so it's good to see him coming in
[1:01:08] this morning into the church amen and we
[1:01:11] want to just greet all of our uh
[1:01:16] saints that are streaming into the
[1:01:18] service this morning and the Lord bless
[1:01:21] you you may have your seat
[1:01:24] as we want to just trust the law for
[1:01:27] what we want to speak this morning
[1:01:29] praise the Lord
[1:01:31] praise the Lord
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:35] I thought I spoke about uh preaching on
[1:01:38] this subject here the condescending of
[1:01:40] God
[1:01:41] and uh I want to take a portion of that
[1:01:46] of that uh subject even though I have
[1:01:50] not spoken it I realize that I'm having
[1:01:53] a bunch of uh Loose Ends of subject that
[1:01:57] is being a wider I've just I've not been
[1:02:01] continuing or finishing my thought I
[1:02:05] know I spoke on the you know the
[1:02:09] the witch that is leading the last day
[1:02:11] of church I want to go back to that
[1:02:14] and then uh
[1:02:17] some of you uh messages we've been
[1:02:20] preaching and that we have not really
[1:02:23] had the time to
[1:02:25] to uh to finish them up
[1:02:28] I also want to go back to uh swearing in
[1:02:33] oats that we spoke about last week
[1:02:36] looking at the difference between when
[1:02:39] the person's word and when a person
[1:02:41] swore with an oath but this morning uh
[1:02:45] uh as I said I want to take a portion of
[1:02:49] a subject I've been studying on the
[1:02:52] condescending of God but uh I want to
[1:02:56] speak on the bride
[1:02:58] co-equality restore
[1:03:01] the bride call equality restore
[1:03:05] praise the Lord
[1:03:07] in the message of marriage and divorce
[1:03:09] brother Branham says the confidence was
[1:03:11] co-equal when God made man the coveting
[1:03:15] was co-equal but now after the fall
[1:03:19] there is another Covenant man
[1:03:22] when men fall God now made another
[1:03:26] Covenant now she's no longer
[1:03:30] ruler with him
[1:03:32] each must have a separate Covenant Now
[1:03:35] Eve was no longer on the basis of coal
[1:03:39] equality with with with Adam and uh
[1:03:43] Genesis 15 come and God says 3 15 he
[1:03:47] says your husband will have the root
[1:03:49] over you
[1:03:50] and so that is that is what we want to
[1:03:53] look at this morning the bride called
[1:03:56] equality restore
[1:03:58] and what I want to deal with this
[1:04:00] morning I want to talk the difference
[1:04:03] between Power Wave and power over
[1:04:09] there's a difference between Power Wave
[1:04:11] and power over if I was if I would just
[1:04:14] jump into the water and you see what I'm
[1:04:18] going is the other uh
[1:04:22] uh God don't have power
[1:04:25] over his people
[1:04:30] praise the Lord yeah I want to get your
[1:04:33] wheel spinning this morning
[1:04:36] God has power with his people
[1:04:39] uh brother brother Stephen ajaro A
[1:04:43] couple of months when he was back with
[1:04:44] us here uh uh one of the evening before
[1:04:48] he and myself when uh
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:52] uh the evening he was here before
[1:04:54] testifying he he he there with uh Jesus
[1:04:58] uh uh statement when he was talking
[1:05:01] there in the gospel and he brought a
[1:05:04] wonderfully how how Jesus in the three
[1:05:07] the three gospels there were days Jesus
[1:05:10] said Matthew chapter 10 I have given you
[1:05:13] power against
[1:05:15] power against every unclean spirit
[1:05:19] and in Mark chapter 6 Jesus said I've
[1:05:23] given you power over
[1:05:25] every unclean spirit
[1:05:28] and uh in in Luke also Jesus used the
[1:05:32] same statement I've given you power over
[1:05:35] so if you study the scripture you will
[1:05:37] realize that God gave us power over God
[1:05:42] have power over the the creation he's
[1:05:46] the god of the creation everything that
[1:05:48] was created he have power over it but
[1:05:51] when it comes to his people there is
[1:05:53] something different about it that I want
[1:05:56] for us to be able to see and so there's
[1:05:59] a difference between Power Wave and
[1:06:01] power over that's why we want to we want
[1:06:04] to we want to study this morning from
[1:06:07] the word of God and uh but if you if you
[1:06:11] even look at this this whole thing of
[1:06:14] power against and power over you'll
[1:06:17] realize that um
[1:06:19] all the gospel there with that statement
[1:06:22] and there with power in a very different
[1:06:24] way just like I said Matthew chapter 10
[1:06:27] Jesus said I've given you power against
[1:06:29] every unclean spirits in Luke 6 Jesus
[1:06:33] used the same thing dealing with the
[1:06:35] same uh uh uh statement he said giving
[1:06:40] you power over every unclean spirit in
[1:06:42] sin Luke the same thing when it came to
[1:06:44] John
[1:06:45] John Deere with power in a different way
[1:06:50] in Saint John chapter 1
[1:06:53] verse 12 he says as many as believe him
[1:06:59] he had given them power
[1:07:02] to become
[1:07:07] praise the Lord
[1:07:08] now so
[1:07:11] he gave us power
[1:07:14] from things
[1:07:16] there are
[1:07:17] uh
[1:07:19] uh separated from us from things
[1:07:23] that are that are now part of us he gave
[1:07:26] us power over those things
[1:07:30] for things that are part of him
[1:07:33] he gave them power
[1:07:36] uh
[1:07:38] with those things and he he empowered
[1:07:41] him so uh that's that's what I want for
[1:07:44] us to look at so here John is saying
[1:07:47] that as many there receive him uh
[1:07:53] he have given them power
[1:07:55] to become sons of God we know the other
[1:08:00] uh we were we were sons of God but their
[1:08:04] power
[1:08:06] can be classified as the quickening
[1:08:09] power the things that Quicken us to the
[1:08:11] recognition of who we are you know uh uh
[1:08:15] you know we we have come to that
[1:08:17] recognition we have come to that reality
[1:08:21] so that's why we want to study the the
[1:08:24] difference between Power Wave and power
[1:08:26] over under the bride
[1:08:29] co-equality restored
[1:08:32] praise the Lord
[1:08:34] God has restored our co-equality
[1:08:39] through Christ Jesus
[1:08:41] amen Romans chapter 8 verse 17 says and
[1:08:47] and if children then hears hears who
[1:08:50] hears of God and John hears with Christ
[1:08:53] there's there's we we are John hears
[1:08:57] with Christ that's that is that is in
[1:09:00] their sense that our core equality is
[1:09:03] restored and uh uh so if so be that we
[1:09:09] suffer
[1:09:10] with him
[1:09:12] we that we may be glorified together
[1:09:17] for a reckon that the suffering of this
[1:09:20] present present time are now water to be
[1:09:25] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:09:28] revealing us
[1:09:29] praise the Lord amen
[1:09:32] now now uh if uh if the the
[1:09:39] the technicians back there can go to my
[1:09:42] first quote there on the seminar Church
[1:09:44] age that's what I'm reading from I want
[1:09:46] I want you to realize something here the
[1:09:49] uh
[1:09:51] as we as we read this unless we suffer
[1:09:55] with him
[1:09:56] we cannot reign
[1:10:00] with him
[1:10:02] amen
[1:10:03] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:10:07] reign with him now what I want you to
[1:10:10] notice in their statement is that you
[1:10:13] don't suffer for God
[1:10:19] you don't suffer for him you suffer with
[1:10:23] him
[1:10:29] praise the Lord
[1:10:30] amen
[1:10:32] now the uh the the Roman Church
[1:10:35] was trying to make people to suffer from
[1:10:38] God what you have to do pennies break
[1:10:41] bottle and and crawl on it and you can
[1:10:44] blade and all of that is when when we
[1:10:47] are practicing
[1:10:48] self-righteousness then we are suffering
[1:10:50] for God
[1:10:52] praise the Lord
[1:10:54] but you don't suffer for God there is no
[1:10:57] amount of penitence a man would do will
[1:11:00] ever be equal to what Jesus went through
[1:11:02] for you
[1:11:04] amen you don't suffer for God
[1:11:07] you suffer with him that's the reason
[1:11:10] why the apostles you know in the book of
[1:11:13] Acts when uh when the when the god
[1:11:15] pitted and John and he took them in and
[1:11:18] they whipped them because uh they they
[1:11:21] make the man the gate of beautiful to
[1:11:24] walk again and and he says were we
[1:11:27] listening to men or will we listen to
[1:11:28] God you know the whip them and they send
[1:11:31] them the Bible says that when rejoicing
[1:11:34] they weren't rejoicing being glad that
[1:11:37] they were partakers
[1:11:38] of his suffering
[1:11:42] okay they were partakers of his
[1:11:45] suffering you know so so so God has
[1:11:49] caught us to partake now if you are
[1:11:53] partaking with somebody praise the Lord
[1:11:56] the person is not over you or honor you
[1:12:02] amen he says he says come let us partake
[1:12:06] of this meal
[1:12:08] we are sitting there at the table
[1:12:10] and I mean your portion might be bigger
[1:12:13] than my portion it don't make you older
[1:12:16] than me
[1:12:17] amen it's just that you get more
[1:12:19] appetite than me praise the Lord
[1:12:22] Hallelujah
[1:12:23] I used to have a young young boy the one
[1:12:28] young man I was trying to help he was
[1:12:31] struggling with drugs many years ago
[1:12:33] back in the Ivory Coast and and uh you
[1:12:37] know and and I saw
[1:12:40] time to eat uh you know he will you take
[1:12:43] the food and then
[1:12:45] he would take small and leave a big
[1:12:48] portion for me I said why you do that he
[1:12:50] said because you're older than me
[1:12:55] you ordered me so you and myself should
[1:12:57] not eat the same but in reality he will
[1:13:01] eat more than I do
[1:13:03] praise the Lord
[1:13:05] I think he was doing it in a sense of
[1:13:07] respect
[1:13:08] but you see and that's that's what I
[1:13:10] want to grab your mind to this morning
[1:13:11] amen praise the Lord
[1:13:15] you know
[1:13:18] all of God's children think about this
[1:13:21] all of God's children
[1:13:23] what is God's age you know God's age how
[1:13:27] old is God
[1:13:29] what is his age
[1:13:32] have you thought of God's age
[1:13:36] don't tell me ancient of day
[1:13:39] God is she's eternity
[1:13:41] he's an internal God
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:45] and all of God's children are in Taylor
[1:13:49] praise the Lord amen so I might have my
[1:13:53] my little daughters there and uh they're
[1:13:56] you know they receive the Lord Jesus and
[1:13:59] they are born again into the kingdom you
[1:14:02] know they are Daughters of God even
[1:14:04] though I am their father
[1:14:06] but when it comes to God and his economy
[1:14:10] we are equal
[1:14:15] that is the equality restore that's what
[1:14:18] I want to bring to your mind I'm diving
[1:14:19] in the water so I hope you get your life
[1:14:22] jacket on Amen because we are right into
[1:14:24] it
[1:14:25] when it comes to God we are equal
[1:14:30] right God don't deal with you and say
[1:14:32] say yeah you know you are the father
[1:14:34] there are certain responsibility that we
[1:14:37] cannot Overlook right amen amen yeah god
[1:14:41] holds me response responsible as a
[1:14:44] steward
[1:14:46] praise the Lord you see my position
[1:14:50] there's a difference between uh
[1:14:53] uh position and Authority
[1:14:58] praise the Lord have you ever seen the
[1:15:01] you know this bus that is that is uh you
[1:15:05] know that is because he's the manager he
[1:15:07] thinks he owns the company
[1:15:10] praise the lord it's just your position
[1:15:13] they could fire you just like they fire
[1:15:15] me
[1:15:21] you see so so those are the things that
[1:15:24] we we want to look at
[1:15:27] we want to look at
[1:15:30] we have we have a position in church
[1:15:33] the scripture places the pastor is the
[1:15:36] elder of the church
[1:15:38] amen
[1:15:40] it does not make him go first born of
[1:15:42] Good Shepherd
[1:15:46] praise the Lord the firstborn of God is
[1:15:49] the logos
[1:15:51] it's out of that logos every son and
[1:15:54] daughter of God came out of
[1:15:58] the pastor that is just his position it
[1:16:01] don't make him the firstborn
[1:16:04] it don't make him older than all the
[1:16:07] people in the church
[1:16:09] is just a position that must be
[1:16:12] respected
[1:16:13] he must respect it as much as the people
[1:16:16] should respect it
[1:16:21] are we together
[1:16:24] are you ready to dive with me
[1:16:27] in two days
[1:16:29] praise the Lord
[1:16:31] so unless we suffer with him
[1:16:35] we cannot reign with him
[1:16:40] so when we Reign when we come to the
[1:16:43] place of authority is with him
[1:16:47] right now that's the reason why you will
[1:16:50] see why this statement has been an
[1:16:53] outstanding statement throughout the
[1:16:55] ages around the message brother Branham
[1:16:57] says the reason for this is
[1:17:02] the reason for this is that character
[1:17:05] simply is never made without suffering
[1:17:10] that's right
[1:17:12] character is a victory
[1:17:16] and not a gift
[1:17:20] praise the Lord
[1:17:22] amen just like people was every you know
[1:17:26] there was this you know respect must be
[1:17:27] earned and all of that but but yeah
[1:17:29] let's stay with this let me not get out
[1:17:32] of place here
[1:17:33] character is a victory
[1:17:38] for you to get character
[1:17:42] to be to be respected
[1:17:47] or a character over a habit
[1:17:51] a character to stand for Christ in this
[1:17:54] age
[1:17:56] it's a victory you must overcome
[1:17:59] something
[1:18:01] you must be able to fight
[1:18:05] it's not a gift it's not something that
[1:18:07] would just be handed down to you
[1:18:13] amen with our character
[1:18:16] cannot Reign because
[1:18:18] power
[1:18:20] apart from character
[1:18:22] is satanic
[1:18:25] that would have been the title of my
[1:18:26] sermon this morning
[1:18:28] but I wanted to keep it in context of
[1:18:30] what I want to talk about
[1:18:33] because power apart from character
[1:18:37] is devilish
[1:18:41] but Power
[1:18:43] with character
[1:18:46] is faith
[1:18:48] to rule
[1:18:52] Power Wave character
[1:18:56] is faith
[1:18:58] to root
[1:18:59] let's stop right there see uh Genesis
[1:19:02] chapter three let's let's go to Genesis
[1:19:04] chapter three I'll catch myself right
[1:19:06] here
[1:19:07] and uh
[1:19:11] we are talking about the core equality
[1:19:13] of of the Bride being restored
[1:19:16] praise the Lord
[1:19:19] we are living in an age I hear this
[1:19:22] thing I hear this thing from from from
[1:19:24] someone most of the time every time he's
[1:19:26] talking he used this statement he says
[1:19:30] uh it's a statement that is out there
[1:19:33] you yeah you hear so much about alpha
[1:19:36] male
[1:19:38] you know I'm an alpha male
[1:19:41] praise the Lord but yet all of these
[1:19:43] people claiming alpha male
[1:19:52] you know I all of these people claiming
[1:19:54] alpha male
[1:19:56] they are only claiming alpha male
[1:19:59] because the thing being the man
[1:20:02] makes them entitled
[1:20:08] to control a woman
[1:20:12] they are claiming alpha male because
[1:20:15] they think being a man you know being a
[1:20:17] man is almost like when a person think
[1:20:19] I'm the firstborn you know they think
[1:20:21] they are because I'm the firstborn so I
[1:20:24] have
[1:20:26] the right entitlement
[1:20:30] that firstborn it just come with a sense
[1:20:32] of entitlement
[1:20:36] praise the Lord
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:39] but we will see they are scripturally
[1:20:41] God don't work like they were the
[1:20:43] firstborn or last born the way that God
[1:20:46] worked for God to be able to entrust any
[1:20:49] of his inheritance to any of his sons or
[1:20:52] children they must go on a tutor and be
[1:20:55] trained
[1:20:56] and they must be able to demonstrate a
[1:20:59] character
[1:21:04] they must be able to demonstrate a
[1:21:06] character so God in the principle of his
[1:21:10] word will put his children on the tutors
[1:21:15] you allow them to be tried to be trained
[1:21:19] and the only reason why he's doing that
[1:21:21] is because he want them to be able to
[1:21:24] get the the character
[1:21:27] because it's your character that
[1:21:29] protects your gift
[1:21:34] praise the Lord you find gift to people
[1:21:36] that don't have character
[1:21:39] praise the Lord
[1:21:45] are we together
[1:21:47] now so in in Genesis 3 15 year we will
[1:21:51] see the change of the coveting we read
[1:21:55] here from Irish and divorce the Covenant
[1:21:58] was co-equal but but now after the fall
[1:22:02] there is another Covenant now she was no
[1:22:06] longer ruler with him now so in Genesis
[1:22:09] 3 here we see uh that um
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:16] verse 16 and God speaks to the woman and
[1:22:19] says unto the woman he says I will
[1:22:21] greatly multiply that sorrow and that
[1:22:25] conception in sorrow thou shall bring
[1:22:27] forth children and that desire shall be
[1:22:31] told their husband and he shall rule
[1:22:35] over thee so now the confidence was
[1:22:37] changed here the woman was placed to a
[1:22:39] place where the man will rule over the
[1:22:42] woman but now see this now as we deal
[1:22:44] with this in the subject he says but
[1:22:47] Power with character is fit to root
[1:22:52] praise the Lord
[1:22:54] now let's take this now and go to
[1:22:56] Ephesian
[1:22:58] let's go to the book of Ephesians and
[1:23:00] see how the Apostle Paul uh positionally
[1:23:04] place these things in and then we will
[1:23:05] we will see where we're going now
[1:23:09] oh praise the Lord amen
[1:23:13] you pray for the service last night
[1:23:17] praise the Lord I was counting on your
[1:23:19] prayers
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:30] now Paul here in Ephesians chapter 5 and
[1:23:33] verse 20 he we read giving thanks always
[1:23:36] for all things unto God and the father
[1:23:41] unto God and the father in the name of
[1:23:43] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:45] submitting yourself
[1:23:47] one to another in the fear of the Lord
[1:23:53] submitting yourself one to another he's
[1:23:57] he's coming to he's coming to play some
[1:23:59] things in order but yet the Apostle Paul
[1:24:02] now is saying mean as a pastor I must
[1:24:05] submit myself to you and you as a
[1:24:08] congregation you must submit yourself to
[1:24:10] me how do we do that
[1:24:13] praise the Lord I cannot take my
[1:24:16] position as a pastor it's just a
[1:24:19] position I must know that I'm
[1:24:22] accountable to you
[1:24:25] that is the way that you submit myself I
[1:24:27] must know that you have a right to ask
[1:24:29] me
[1:24:31] any question
[1:24:34] praise the Lord
[1:24:35] my position don't give me the right to
[1:24:38] live in a house and says that nobody can
[1:24:40] ask me any question
[1:24:42] right
[1:24:43] it does not give me the right to preach
[1:24:45] anything it says well don't I'm going to
[1:24:47] preach it don't ask me any question
[1:24:51] hey don't give me that right
[1:24:55] are we together
[1:24:57] now so he's he's going to say yeah
[1:25:00] submit yourself one unto another
[1:25:05] glory be to God
[1:25:09] and uh this is uh this is uh you know
[1:25:14] the
[1:25:15] the wonderful scripture that we all like
[1:25:18] it's a wedding scripture you like to
[1:25:21] hear this during the wedding they are
[1:25:23] all smiling on their faces
[1:25:25] when is the wedding time
[1:25:27] wife submit yourself unto your own
[1:25:30] husband as unto the Lord
[1:25:33] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:25:36] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:25:41] and he is the savior of the body
[1:25:46] are we together
[1:25:48] now so Paul
[1:25:53] Paul year is is going to place an order
[1:25:58] he's going to place
[1:26:00] uh uh and and other of
[1:26:04] sequence if I if I would say it like
[1:26:06] that
[1:26:08] and you will understand me anyway as I
[1:26:10] will as I will explain myself here he's
[1:26:12] going to place Christ as the head of the
[1:26:16] man and the man as the head of the woman
[1:26:19] praise the Lord the woman as the head of
[1:26:22] the home
[1:26:23] praise the Lord
[1:26:25] now so you will see here if power
[1:26:31] with character is fit to rule it will be
[1:26:35] at the place where the other even though
[1:26:39] the man that with the change of the
[1:26:41] Covenant year now the man the uh God is
[1:26:45] saying that your your desire will be to
[1:26:47] your husband and he will have the rule
[1:26:49] over you it's it is not because he's
[1:26:52] born as a male
[1:26:55] it's not because he's he's and he's a
[1:26:58] male that that that uh that that that
[1:27:01] gives him that right you you have to
[1:27:03] realize here is that it's a word of God
[1:27:06] it's something that God is expecting for
[1:27:08] the man to be able to demonstrate
[1:27:13] and what is that if we must submit
[1:27:15] ourselves what onto another what a man
[1:27:18] must be able to demonstrate to have that
[1:27:20] thing to work is for him to submit
[1:27:23] himself to his head which is Christ
[1:27:28] amen for you to have that to work
[1:27:31] I mean you can print it as a big import
[1:27:34] letter and stick it right on the wall
[1:27:36] you know while the members have the root
[1:27:39] it does not work that way
[1:27:43] so you see what I'm saying is something
[1:27:46] that God placed in his word this is the
[1:27:49] word of God this is not just uh uh human
[1:27:52] expression it's not it's not man's mind
[1:28:00] now if God is changing the Covenant from
[1:28:03] from a place of code equal and now he's
[1:28:06] placing a man to the place here where
[1:28:08] he's going to rule over this woman he is
[1:28:10] it's not by it's not by the way that his
[1:28:14] parents brought him up it's not by his
[1:28:16] acne where neither his National way and
[1:28:18] all it has to be by the word of God
[1:28:22] right man
[1:28:26] are we together
[1:28:28] now so we see here that character is a
[1:28:32] victory
[1:28:33] it's not a gift and a man with our
[1:28:36] character
[1:28:38] can reign because power apart from
[1:28:41] character is satanic and that's why we
[1:28:44] have the word that the way that we have
[1:28:46] today remain one man can sit down in
[1:28:48] Russia and and blow the whole place up
[1:28:51] because he thinks that you know I'm I'm
[1:28:53] the one in charge here I give a command
[1:28:56] even if you don't do it we fire you
[1:28:58] praise the Lord and and yeah that is
[1:29:01] that is that is a power without
[1:29:03] character
[1:29:06] that is power with our character
[1:29:09] but Power with character
[1:29:12] the way it rules is that
[1:29:15] it includes out of his subjects
[1:29:19] power with character include out of its
[1:29:22] subjects
[1:29:26] you see that's the reason why for God to
[1:29:28] rule to become Lord over us he has to
[1:29:32] include us by the new birth
[1:29:36] praise the Lord he has to include us by
[1:29:39] the new birth
[1:29:40] because if we are now born again there
[1:29:44] is no way the world can root over us we
[1:29:47] will we will struggle constantly
[1:29:52] so God has to include us into his nature
[1:29:59] by the new birth
[1:30:05] praise the Lord
[1:30:10] now so we're talking about here the
[1:30:12] bride called equality restore power
[1:30:16] weight versus power over
[1:30:22] I'm giving power over demons
[1:30:25] I'm not giving power over you
[1:30:29] I don't have power over you
[1:30:32] amen
[1:30:33] I have power with you
[1:30:42] that's the reason why the Billet cannot
[1:30:44] persecute and heal it that's the reason
[1:30:46] why the bride will not rule over a bride
[1:30:56] are we together
[1:31:00] so a man with five character can't Reign
[1:31:03] because power apart from character is
[1:31:05] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:31:08] to root
[1:31:09] and since he want us to share to share
[1:31:16] he want us to share he that overcome
[1:31:19] will sit with me in my throne
[1:31:23] no he not that he that all that come
[1:31:25] would come he would sit down I'll put my
[1:31:27] feet over him when you overcome you will
[1:31:30] sit down under my throne and I will sit
[1:31:32] on top of you no you will sit with me in
[1:31:35] my throne even as I have overcome and I
[1:31:39] sat down with the father in his throne
[1:31:42] when God rules his people he share his
[1:31:45] power with them
[1:31:48] he don't enslave us
[1:31:53] God only slave his children
[1:31:56] right
[1:31:57] he empowered them
[1:32:06] that's the reason why by the law no
[1:32:08] flesh shall be justified
[1:32:11] God don't enslave his people
[1:32:13] he empowers them
[1:32:18] how we give you power when Holy Ghost
[1:32:20] shall come
[1:32:22] he Empower his people
[1:32:25] we keep locking ourselves as all pitiful
[1:32:28] sinners
[1:32:29] that's the reason why we just sit in
[1:32:31] church and gesture other preacher we can
[1:32:34] never rejoice in the word
[1:32:36] when a word is here to empower you
[1:32:38] you're just staring at me and where is
[1:32:40] he going
[1:32:42] praise the Lord I'm not afraid of your
[1:32:44] faces I'm going to preach anyhow
[1:32:48] amen
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:54] I expect you to rejoice in the word
[1:32:57] to be glad that God is sharing his power
[1:33:00] with you and that makes you an overcomer
[1:33:03] praise the Lord
[1:33:06] that makes you an overcomer
[1:33:08] for you to know that God is sharing his
[1:33:11] power with you he's bringing you into an
[1:33:13] inclusive read
[1:33:16] an inclusive ring he's your lord and
[1:33:19] your God but yet he's getting you
[1:33:22] involved
[1:33:24] that's the reason why he could list him
[1:33:26] say he could get a better idea from
[1:33:29] Moses
[1:33:32] he could get a better idea from Moses
[1:33:36] and Moses says when you when you kill
[1:33:38] all these people why you expect the
[1:33:40] Nations to say
[1:33:45] that we serve
[1:33:48] the one that enslaved us
[1:33:51] amen
[1:33:52] your church denomination have enslaved
[1:33:55] you your religious ideas have enslaved
[1:33:58] you but he that the son has set free are
[1:34:01] there people that are free here
[1:34:03] have the sun sets you free have the sun
[1:34:07] sets you free you must be free today
[1:34:11] praise the Lord
[1:34:13] you mean you free you can't even clap
[1:34:15] your hands
[1:34:17] a chain Bound in your hands and you
[1:34:19] can't even clap your hands
[1:34:21] my goodness that devil is so bad he's so
[1:34:25] wicked he has enslaved our so much now
[1:34:29] to even rejoice in what God has really
[1:34:32] given to how we struggle
[1:34:37] praise the Lord just like Johnny Crow
[1:34:39] joining Crow being Thai
[1:34:41] now he's free he can't go anywhere he
[1:34:44] just around the tree because that's the
[1:34:47] only Destiny he could go and that's the
[1:34:49] same thing that you are doing

[1:38:19] practice so we can be able to sing a
[1:38:21] song or two on the coming weekend praise
[1:38:24] the Lord now finish talking this I got
[1:38:26] to get back into my preaching mode again
[1:38:29] amen
[1:38:31] I gotta get back into my preaching wall
[1:38:34] should we stand for the reading of the
[1:38:35] word
[1:38:36] or we have already read the word okay
[1:38:41] thank you
[1:38:48] uh praise the Lord
[1:38:57] I trust the Lord here let me use a very
[1:39:01] simple principle
[1:39:03] can you uh
[1:39:05] Port mine
[1:39:07] my five kingdoms there are five kingdoms
[1:39:10] in this word that we lay we have five
[1:39:13] kingdoms
[1:39:16] there are five kingdoms
[1:39:19] you have the kingdom of God
[1:39:25] you have the human Kingdom
[1:39:27] you have the animal kingdom
[1:39:30] you have the plains Kingdom
[1:39:32] and you have the mineral Kingdom
[1:39:37] praise the Lord
[1:39:40] and God has put boundaries between these
[1:39:44] kingdoms
[1:39:47] amen God have post boundaries if men are
[1:39:51] trying to break there to go and become
[1:39:53] an animal
[1:39:54] um
[1:39:55] but God has put boundary
[1:39:58] the way for him to differentiate us
[1:40:00] between the animal he gave us soul
[1:40:04] and animals do not have a soul
[1:40:06] so God has put boundaries
[1:40:11] glory be to God
[1:40:14] he kept the mineral Kingdom Under the
[1:40:17] Earth
[1:40:21] praise the Lord
[1:40:24] he kept the meaning of Kingdom Under the
[1:40:26] Earth
[1:40:27] now a principle here that I want to show
[1:40:31] you uh
[1:40:34] for us to be able to to appreciate
[1:40:37] the subject here is the other
[1:40:40] the minerals kingdom is is under the
[1:40:44] Earth
[1:40:46] okay
[1:40:47] and uh the only way
[1:40:51] that
[1:40:53] the plain Kingdom
[1:40:56] can be able
[1:40:59] to to uh to share a throne or share a
[1:41:04] ruling with the mineral Kingdom
[1:41:07] is that the planes have to extend their
[1:41:11] roots
[1:41:13] down
[1:41:15] into the Earth
[1:41:18] to be able to draw the mineral up
[1:41:24] praise the Lord
[1:41:26] all the the proteins in in all of those
[1:41:31] uh uh minerals the plants have to
[1:41:34] stretch their Roots down into the Earth
[1:41:37] and they have to to gather
[1:41:41] the the minerals
[1:41:43] and and and you know and pull them up to
[1:41:46] their level
[1:41:49] praise the Lord
[1:41:51] amen
[1:41:53] and for the animal kingdom
[1:41:57] to also benefit
[1:42:01] from the minerals of the Earth
[1:42:04] and uh the plant kingdom
[1:42:07] they have to also go down
[1:42:10] and eat the grass
[1:42:12] and eat the plants
[1:42:16] to be able to bring the mineral Kingdom
[1:42:19] and the plain Kingdom
[1:42:23] to the same level
[1:42:25] so you see there is always a
[1:42:28] condescending
[1:42:32] amen
[1:42:33] the planes have to condescend they have
[1:42:35] to stretch their Roots down
[1:42:41] to be able to bring the mineral up to
[1:42:43] draw the mineral out of the Earth
[1:42:47] the animals have to go down and eat the
[1:42:50] grass and eat the trees and eat the
[1:42:52] leaves and all of that
[1:42:56] praise the Lord
[1:43:00] glory be to God
[1:43:05] and we ourselves we have to condescend
[1:43:11] to the Animal Kingdom
[1:43:22] something Have To Die For Something To
[1:43:24] Live
[1:43:28] praise the Lord
[1:43:30] amen
[1:43:32] I mean I mean you wish everywhere you
[1:43:34] choose even if you say you are a
[1:43:36] vegetarian you I mean you you are just
[1:43:38] jumping over the animal kingdom and
[1:43:40] going down to the to the to the leaves
[1:43:44] what are you are a vegetarian or
[1:43:45] whichever choice you you gotta go down
[1:43:48] to something
[1:43:51] to be able to get your vitamins and
[1:43:53] whatever you want to get
[1:43:55] but you see it's a law
[1:43:58] it's a law and God placed their Lobby
[1:44:05] there is no way you can just stay as a
[1:44:08] human and a very intelligent human
[1:44:12] there is no way you can stay as an
[1:44:14] intelligent human
[1:44:16] for you to benefit from the minerals
[1:44:19] that are in the Earth
[1:44:20] you will have to go down
[1:44:25] praise the Lord
[1:44:27] whether they were processing and put it
[1:44:29] important for you to suck
[1:44:31] or drink
[1:44:33] or take as pills and taking my vitamins
[1:44:40] they have to come from the Earth
[1:44:42] someone has to reach down
[1:44:45] and bring it off from the Earth
[1:44:50] praise the Lord
[1:44:52] amen now here is man here he's so smart
[1:44:55] and he thinks that he's powerful
[1:44:59] he can go to the Gene and build his
[1:45:01] muscles and build his arms and all of
[1:45:03] that
[1:45:04] praise the Lord
[1:45:09] and with all of his intelligence
[1:45:12] he don't realize that
[1:45:16] the vati means that he needs to keep his
[1:45:20] brain together
[1:45:23] come from a kingdom that is lower than
[1:45:25] him
[1:45:28] to despise thy kingdom is death
[1:45:36] praise the Lord
[1:45:38] Amen to despise thy kingdom that lower
[1:45:42] kingdom is death
[1:45:51] you see the sense of co-equalness
[1:45:55] a law that God placed
[1:45:58] in the Earth
[1:46:00] to make you as equal with the mineral
[1:46:03] Kingdom
[1:46:05] even though his honor the Earth is not
[1:46:08] visible
[1:46:09] praise the Lord
[1:46:11] amen
[1:46:12] all you see it looks like a grass behind
[1:46:15] this grass that's growing there take the
[1:46:16] machine the morning and all of that all
[1:46:18] you see it as a forest but uh uh it
[1:46:22] looks like it's a I mean It's a Grind
[1:46:24] it's just a Green Feed and all of that
[1:46:26] praise the Lord
[1:46:28] but when you when you get that stick on
[1:46:31] your table and you're eating
[1:46:33] and you cutting it
[1:46:35] and you lick in your mouth is that grass
[1:46:41] there are green grass that had just
[1:46:43] transformed looking red before you
[1:46:50] praise the Lord
[1:46:52] it's a law that God placed
[1:47:01] for you to despise one
[1:47:03] is to eliminate yourself
[1:47:11] Hallelujah
[1:47:13] for the animal kingdom to come up to the
[1:47:16] human Kingdom it has to die
[1:47:22] praise the Lord
[1:47:24] for the human Kingdom to come up to the
[1:47:26] kingdom of God he has to die and be born
[1:47:30] again
[1:47:33] [Applause]
[1:47:35] he has to die and be born again
[1:47:40] but I asked you just remain a church
[1:47:42] member right you become a religious
[1:47:45] human being in a human Kingdom that have
[1:47:48] a knowledge of God but can never step up
[1:47:50] in their reign of righteousness and
[1:47:53] Holiness because you are not born again
[1:47:55] you have to die and be born again for
[1:47:58] you to step up into the kingdom of God
[1:48:03] Jesus said no man can see the kingdom of
[1:48:06] God except he is born again
[1:48:10] just life for the animal kingdom to come
[1:48:13] up to the human Kingdom it has to die
[1:48:16] and be watch
[1:48:18] fry or gray whichever way you do it
[1:48:23] whichever way you do it
[1:48:25] but that's the way that the animal
[1:48:27] kingdom come up
[1:48:28] the plain Kingdom you gotta wash it you
[1:48:30] gotta board it you gotta slash it you
[1:48:32] got to contact whichever way you do it
[1:48:41] praise the Lord
[1:48:43] show me your power
[1:48:46] show me your power
[1:48:48] show me your muscles
[1:48:51] amen
[1:48:52] I'll tell you how much leaves you need
[1:48:54] to eat
[1:48:59] so you see this alone of God
[1:49:04] the way that God almighty God exercised
[1:49:08] his power
[1:49:10] is inclusive
[1:49:14] let's just read it a little bit
[1:49:16] me trying
[1:49:18] to close up here before
[1:49:19] I lose time
[1:49:26] attitude and who is god well I'm afraid
[1:49:30] that the church doesn't know the
[1:49:31] authority
[1:49:33] I'm afraid that the Holy Ghost born men
[1:49:35] doesn't realize the authority The
[1:49:38] Authority that God has permitted in his
[1:49:41] church
[1:49:42] I will give unto thee the Keys of the
[1:49:46] Kingdom whatsoever you bound on Earth
[1:49:49] what an authority
[1:49:51] amen what an authority you see sin has
[1:49:55] affected us so much that when we see
[1:49:58] these things we always apply them in the
[1:50:01] negative way that's the reason why this
[1:50:04] scripture is only used when there is
[1:50:06] problem in the church
[1:50:08] I will bound you but he said whatsoever
[1:50:11] whatsoever you can bound a sickness you
[1:50:15] can bound a habit
[1:50:17] you can also also bound your family to
[1:50:20] stay together
[1:50:21] yeah
[1:50:22] that's right whatsoever
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:32] there's a bounding power
[1:50:34] whatsoever you're born on the Earth will
[1:50:37] be bound in heaven and whatsoever you
[1:50:39] loose on Earth will be loose I give you
[1:50:43] power over serpent sin and over over
[1:50:47] over over
[1:50:49] is not part of you whatever you have
[1:50:52] power over is not part of you
[1:50:54] if it is part of you you have power away
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:09] glory be to God
[1:51:13] that's the reason why people
[1:51:17] we read and listen to brother Brandon
[1:51:20] message with an intellectual mind
[1:51:23] and most of the time we just read and
[1:51:25] listen to it to to equip ourselves
[1:51:29] or make ourselves smarter than the other
[1:51:32] person
[1:51:34] but these are the Divine word of God
[1:51:36] this is the mind of God
[1:51:39] these are the things that were in the
[1:51:41] back part of God's mind
[1:51:44] to free you
[1:51:47] praise the Lord
[1:51:49] amen
[1:51:51] the child must never be afraid of their
[1:51:53] parents
[1:51:55] no
[1:51:58] they might never be afraid I mean a a
[1:52:00] wife and a husband it must never be even
[1:52:03] in a natural life that's the way that
[1:52:04] God that's the way that God set it up
[1:52:07] if the home right leg comes under the
[1:52:10] law of God and that home is governed by
[1:52:13] God
[1:52:16] praise the Lord
[1:52:20] oh there must be laughter
[1:52:24] there must be laughter and uh I mean and
[1:52:27] and enjoy it and and you know that I
[1:52:31] mean that that's that's the way that God
[1:52:32] set it up
[1:52:39] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:52:42] the people must not have one one one
[1:52:44] life one they get their Church life and
[1:52:47] they get their Wally life
[1:52:51] praise the Lord
[1:52:54] and we're going to the house of God
[1:53:06] praise the Lord
[1:53:08] that's the reason why the Holy Ghost
[1:53:10] will call you a hypocrite when they
[1:53:12] behave like yes
[1:53:16] praise the Lord
[1:53:18] oh yeah because you must be a Child In
[1:53:20] God's Presence amen you must be a child
[1:53:23] and you must express yourself as a child

[1:53:35] must be a child that's that's the
[1:53:36] present of your father you must be able
[1:53:38] to express yourself as a child
[1:53:51] I'm afraid that the church doesn't know
[1:53:52] the authority
[1:53:54] we think that our our Authority is one
[1:53:57] group over another group
[1:53:59] amen we are the old-timers you are the
[1:54:02] youngest

[1:54:58] realize the authority The Authority that
[1:55:01] God has permitted to his church I give
[1:55:04] you the keys whatsoever you bound on the
[1:55:06] earth is bound whatsoever you lose this
[1:55:08] loose I give you power over serpents and

[2:00:27] praise the Lord
[2:00:28] amen that was one of the that was one of
[2:00:31] the the the the trouble if you know the
[2:00:34] uh
[2:00:35] uh
[2:00:38] Ray boss he was one former gospel
[2:00:41] musician
[2:00:43] that struggle out of his life
[2:00:45] with a homosexual thinking
[2:00:48] in his life he struggled with that
[2:00:51] and he sang a song and when he testified
[2:00:54] on that on that song he says he just
[2:00:58] thought they had a you know with
[2:01:00] everything that he he learned in this
[2:01:03] church and was preached told when you
[2:01:05] have something you should just come to
[2:01:06] the altar you know people come to the
[2:01:07] Altar for auto call you know and and all
[2:01:10] of that you and and that is the thing
[2:01:12] that that is just that is just a kind of
[2:01:14] for religious spirit you know people
[2:01:16] just can't they see people coming to the
[2:01:18] altar they just come to the author with
[2:01:20] no determination
[2:01:22] you know they don't even identify why
[2:01:24] they're coming to the Altar for
[2:01:29] praise the Lord
[2:01:32] and it just come and then as a scene of
[2:01:34] prayer is saying I received I received
[2:01:36] Jesus uh the Lord said I'm the Lord
[2:01:38] Savior and then and then go and sit down
[2:01:41] back
[2:01:43] you are not a child that is born yet
[2:01:46] praise the Lord
[2:01:50] that's what the father looks for
[2:01:53] a son
[2:01:54] that is interested in protecting his
[2:01:57] inheritance
[2:01:59] that's what the father looks for
[2:02:01] you are his inheritance you must take
[2:02:05] interest in protecting yourself
[2:02:10] praise the Lord
[2:02:13] that's why the father take interest in
[2:02:15] that's what he looks for
[2:02:17] when he finds a son that has interest
[2:02:21] in watching over the father
[2:02:23] inheritance
[2:02:27] glory be to God
[2:02:31] so he came and he said he says I will
[2:02:33] come to the Altar and then I will leave
[2:02:35] from there but nothing changed
[2:02:37] is because you are not making effort
[2:02:40] for it to be changed
[2:02:42] praise the Lord if you praying against
[2:02:45] it and it cannot change get another
[2:02:47] person and I suppose that devil
[2:02:50] and say I'm tired with this thing I'm
[2:02:53] tired I'm tired with it
[2:02:55] that's not me and I don't want it to be
[2:02:57] me
[2:02:58] Jesus there in the in in uh Saint John
[2:03:02] chapter 13. every time we read it every
[2:03:04] time we read it for communion Jesus says
[2:03:07] Satan has no part
[2:03:09] with me
[2:03:11] he told Peter he says if I don't watch
[2:03:14] you
[2:03:15] amen if I don't watch you you don't have
[2:03:18] no path with me
[2:03:22] praise the Lord
[2:03:25] that's the reason why he have power over
[2:03:28] Satan because Satan don't have no path
[2:03:30] with him
[2:03:31] that's the reason why he gave us power
[2:03:33] over the devil because the devil don't
[2:03:35] have no path with him
[2:03:40] but as his children
[2:03:42] he gave us Power Wave
[2:03:45] with him
[2:03:49] praise the Lord you see that's the
[2:03:51] reason why the difference between a
[2:03:53] kingdom root
[2:03:55] and uh uh a democratic roof
[2:04:00] praise the Lord
[2:04:01] amen honor a democratic rule you have uh
[2:04:05] uh uh divided powers
[2:04:08] so the man is dead he's not uh he's I
[2:04:12] mean he's dead you don't like him even
[2:04:14] though he's depressed you're just
[2:04:15] waiting for that four years six years to
[2:04:17] reach
[2:04:18] I'm going to cast my vote will get rid
[2:04:20] of him
[2:04:21] but you see honor a kingdom ruled
[2:04:24] unless he's a weaker King
[2:04:27] and if he said Wiki King he don't last
[2:04:28] long
[2:04:29] but what makes the kingdom rule powerful
[2:04:32] because it's an inclusive
[2:04:37] it has to be an inclusive rule that's
[2:04:39] the reason why Jesus always speak about
[2:04:41] the kingdom of God God deal with his
[2:04:44] people now on a democratic rule divided
[2:04:47] powers in the church
[2:04:49] no it's honor a kingdom principle
[2:04:55] honor a kingdom principle is with
[2:04:57] inclusive he included Us by the new
[2:05:00] birth he brought us to the right
[2:05:07] not our servants
[2:05:12] not our servants
[2:05:16] oh yeah you use that you know I'm a
[2:05:18] servant of God that is that is that is
[2:05:20] just uh uh a title of our service
[2:05:24] because that's what we must do it's part
[2:05:27] of our duty
[2:05:29] to serve one another
[2:05:32] praise the Lord
[2:05:34] to save one another a child must never
[2:05:37] must never feel awkward to be able to
[2:05:39] save their parents
[2:05:42] praise the Lord
[2:05:48] are we together
[2:05:50] the same thing with her parent
[2:05:54] now let's just take something here now I
[2:05:55] realize I just have few minutes I will
[2:05:57] try to close here
[2:06:00] wash dish Now with uh with with God
[2:06:03] dealing with Jacob
[2:06:04] and see what's happening here Israel in
[2:06:07] the church now watch
[2:06:08] he touched his time and Jacob walked
[2:06:11] different
[2:06:12] amen I hope that goes way down home
[2:06:16] when you rise up with God you will walk
[2:06:19] different
[2:06:21] praise the Lord
[2:06:22] you will walk different will not only
[2:06:24] affect your walk it will affect your
[2:06:26] mind it will affect your desire it will
[2:06:29] affect your entire life
[2:06:32] praise the Lord
[2:06:33] hear us out with God he walked different
[2:06:36] on the other side
[2:06:38] that little river he was a strong great
[2:06:40] man that backslaughter he knew how to
[2:06:42] cheat
[2:06:44] praise the Lord
[2:06:45] but this one he will not cheat God
[2:06:50] knew where to get him
[2:06:54] praise the Lord
[2:06:55] and I've gone knows where to get you
[2:06:58] he knows where to get you he knows where
[2:07:02] to touch you
[2:07:03] praise the Lord amen he knows where to
[2:07:06] get you
[2:07:07] praise the Lord and whether you like it
[2:07:09] or not
[2:07:11] if his love is upon you he will touch
[2:07:14] that spot
[2:07:15] amen
[2:07:17] one thing you can do to avoid is to just
[2:07:19] surround him
[2:07:26] he was a strong Red Man backslider go
[2:07:30] away from God running from his brother
[2:07:32] running from God
[2:07:34] on the other side of the Brooks he was a
[2:07:38] leaping Prince
[2:07:40] the scripture says Thou Are a prince of
[2:07:43] God
[2:07:44] for you have power with God
[2:07:48] look in the scripture that's how God
[2:07:50] told Jacob
[2:07:52] you have power with God
[2:07:57] as a leaping Prince
[2:07:59] something happened to him God brought
[2:08:03] him God adopted him
[2:08:05] he was a stubborn boy
[2:08:08] trying to have his own way run his own
[2:08:10] life
[2:08:13] won't listen to anybody
[2:08:17] praise the Lord
[2:08:19] but because God law was upon him God
[2:08:22] adopted God had to do something special
[2:08:25] to bring him back in line
[2:08:29] I said now
[2:08:30] you have power with God
[2:08:34] amen
[2:08:41] praise the Lord
[2:08:43] now you have power with God perfect
[2:08:45] strength perfect weakness rather all
[2:08:47] Jacob hell on all night he sure did hold
[2:08:51] on a little longer but when he
[2:08:53] surrounded himself when he got weak and
[2:08:56] couldn't hold no longer oh God let the
[2:08:59] church get Let the church get like that
[2:09:01] the church get to a place where it can
[2:09:04] hold no longer with the with the natural
[2:09:07] habilitation but has to give over to God
[2:09:11] it was then that Jacob become a prince
[2:09:15] of God the Bible said he become a prince
[2:09:18] and his name was changed remember he was
[2:09:21] a great strong man on the other side
[2:09:23] intellectual powerful but on the other
[2:09:26] side he was a living Prince weak and
[2:09:30] worn down
[2:09:31] but
[2:09:32] her power
[2:09:35] before God
[2:09:39] oh God praise the Lord
[2:09:40] oh that's the reason why I appreciate
[2:09:42] one brother but Andrew said on Wednesday
[2:09:44] night your faith
[2:09:47] is stronger
[2:09:48] than your weakness your faith is
[2:09:52] stronger than your sickness
[2:09:56] but it's an element that you don't see
[2:09:59] that's the reason why you don't put
[2:10:01] emphasis on it
[2:10:03] emphasis to the one that you see that
[2:10:05] battle your mind and and bother you all
[2:10:07] the trouble but you don't put emphasis
[2:10:09] you don't nourish their faith
[2:10:14] praise the Lord
[2:10:22] he has power with God
[2:10:26] it was then Jacob uh become a prince the
[2:10:29] Bible says his name was changed
[2:10:33] he had power before God
[2:10:35] you may be in an Old Fashioned

[2:12:53] than the band that he was born in
[2:12:56] praise the Lord
[2:12:58] some were born in very beautiful
[2:12:59] hospitals were taken care of
[2:13:03] but it was sheeps
[2:13:04] cows that witnessed his birth
[2:13:09] they were the first voices he heard

[2:13:37] that shows how much powerful you are
[2:13:40] when you can humble yourself

[2:13:53] praise the Lord you have these people
[2:13:55] that have this private Christian Life
[2:13:57] their Christian Life that private
[2:14:00] is that church I go to work yeah nobody

[2:15:11] what is the Holy Ghost given for to
[2:15:13] empower
[2:15:15] how God's work
[2:15:17] that's the reason why when God raised up

[2:15:42] something picking up the kids
[2:15:45] of the Philistine on his shoulder
[2:15:48] why God does that
[2:15:51] it's not because of the man it's for the
[2:15:54] people to believe the gift
[2:15:56] that he sent to lead him
[2:16:00] it's not the man it's the gift
