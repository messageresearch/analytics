But it's good to be in the house of the Lord. I will uh stand with brother Ben and say we want to thank and appreciate each and every one of you. Thank you for your prayers. Thank you for your support. Amen. And uh uh you know we we uh just think about uh uh how the Lord has been uh good to us and and all of the things that uh he has brought us through as a church. Amen. as I was uh just appreciating the Lord uh last night and and getting ready for service this morning. By the way, brother brother Jain is going to bring us uh the message this morning. You appreciate the message on uh Friday night. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] That was a short and quick one. Amen. &gt;&gt; He told me he was going to preach shot. I didn't know it was going to be that shot or else I was going to bring my notes right behind him. Praise the Lord. But uh thank you also for supporting the prayer meeting on uh Friday night. Like I told you, it was it was going to drive itself in a way that it was just uh a service of appreciation. We just wanted to come and thank the Lord for being with us as a church and uh I know some came from work and uh and some had to leave, go home, get sleep and go to work. We understand all of that. But we want to appreciate you for uh being part of the service even those that were not able to come and were able to stream in. You know church is uh it's a place where some come to associate they love their friends and uh they love their relative. They love the people. For some other people church is a place where they come to hang out and uh they enjoy the music. But for the children of God, church is our life. Praise the Lord. Church is our life. Because whether we are in this building or we are at home or we are at work, we are in church. We are never away from his presence. So church is our life. Whether we are on vacation, we are in church. Praise the Lord. And if you remember, I told you this uh uh many years ago when I started here, especially stepping in as the pastor, the success to every relationship is when you all can grow up together. I might have been preaching. I having one year over this church. This church is 30 years old. I've been preaching for 31 years. So I feel older than the church. But I mean you can take a person from anywhere. You can take a old preacher. You can bring uh uh any any of the preachers that can run through your mind. You bring him to this church or take him to a new church. If that preacher do not step down and grow with the people, it will never be successful. the best way you can see it. Sometimes that's the thing that affect us in our parenting because we don't want to step down to the level of our children even in marriage relationship. If you don't grow together, if you don't understand it that this is a family that had just been birthed, your family when you take your vow, oh, we have a baby dedication. I shouldn't forget that. And I think it's a good thing. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's a sign of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh, Brother Ery told me they were going to do at the end of the month last night. He told me, uh, today. So, I said, Lord, thank you. I mean, it's it's a sign of life. Praise the Lord. you know uh if you if you don't understand it when you take your vow and you said uh yes I do and you say that you know uh uh uh you know uh uh uh in in sickness and in health and you you take that vow you have to understand that uh uh you know uh uh a child has just been born that union has just been born and you have to grow. But what happened were we all stop we get stuck in our individual identity and that's where the crisis come and uh uh so in every in every relationship I've I've understand that in dealing with uh church you have to we all have to grow together you know you have to bear with me and I have to bear with you and I think you've been very good bearing with me. Amen. You've been very good bearing with me in these days where I'm in memory loss. You are all bearing with me. So, it's all good. Praise the Lord. So, uh uh I pray that uh uh we don't know how many years, you know, that the Lord uh will have us be here and uh but we hope to be here till Jesus come. Amen. Or if we go by the weight of the grave, praise the Lord. And uh I pray that uh the Lord will bless us together. The Lord will bless us together. Praise the Lord. And uh Brother Wesley and sister Carol spoke to brother Wesley yesterday. He want for us to continue to pray for them. He told me giving an update on his uh uh visit to the doctor just like I said because of the sunlight. So they had to inject some steroids in his eyes to see if it will kind of his help his eyesight and also uh uh uh sar went for a checkup, you know. Uh uh when you have uh people that have lived many years, few years in a church, it's a blessing. It's a blessing. especially when you have them with a long walking experience. I mean, brother Wesley and his sister Cara have 50 years of marriage relationship. So, we it works. If it work for them, it can work for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It can work for me. So, all of those things encourage when you have people uh of those years and age. And sister Carol had a blessing to be in the service where marriage and divorce was preached. her brother was a deacon there in Brandham Tabernacle. So uh uh but beside that both of them had their personal experience with the Lord Jesus Christ. So we thank the Lord for that. Amen. And we want to thank the Lord also for the grace he's given to sister Naomi and uh we appreciate we appreciate her. We appreciate her. uh her husband was our long song leader turning over to his song Lloyd and all of that, but he's looking down from behind the curtain of time. Amen. We want to thank the Lord for all of that. And uh and that's that's how we we you know that's how we'll be going you know and uh as we grow up together just like I said if the Lord Jesus tried all of these young ladies sitting down down there we will go to their graduation and the next thing will be looking forward to their wedding. Praise the Lord. And and that's just how generation comes and generation goes. Praise the Lord. But the church remains. Amen. &gt;&gt; The church remains. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. We We thank the Lord. We thank the Lord. Amen. We thank the Lord. Amen. We thank the Lord. So, let's just do our baby dedication. Let's do our baby dedication. Yeah, you and the wife, you can you can bring the baby. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you would do it when you're standing here. He's he's my he's my he's my younger twin. So sometime our heart don't be together. Amen. I just think uh uh Jesus love me. I know. Little ones to him belong. They are weak, but he is strong. And yes, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. Let's sing that one more time. We sing. Yes, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. [Music] &gt;&gt; But I had a little testimony before we dedicate this baby. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's good to be in the house of the Lord uh this morning. Uh I had a little testimony to share with you for the glory of God. Uh and as many of you guys might have uh known that uh uh we had lost a baby after Joseph uh but God is merciful and gracious unto us. Uh God has been so good to us that I can't even know how to express it. Um but anyway, so when we had lost the baby, it was very very hard for me and my wife and uh we went through a lot. We went through a lot and and it was really hard for us and uh just to remember that I appreciate brother one. He was there with us praying for us and supporting us to the best of his ability. And just as we were we were just praying and just waiting on the Lord and we came to to learn that my wife was expecting another baby and uh that was really a blessing to us. And you know when you lose a baby and fear comes in but for some reason God just created the atmosphere around the house that was just special. You know for those that been in the house we always listen to the tape playing 24 hours. So the atmosphere was just right to welcome the baby. And um as we were just expecting the baby, we didn't know if we wanted a boy or a girl. So for some reason, God inspired both of us to have my parents over just before the travel. And uh uh we um we invited them and we were sitting with them at home. I think my sister, my older sister had the result if he was whether girl or boy. And as we were sitting there, uh, my sister just announced and say, "Oh, wow." You know, it's a girl, you know, and I was so happy. I never cried like that. Those that were there at the home, I just I just cried like a baby in front of everybody because it looks like I was holding a lot of things in my heart until uh that specific day. Uh so that very night uh we had a prayer meeting. How many of us know that we always have prayer meeting every single night? And then that very same night in because we we usually just read chapter after chapter every single day. But that day that specific day that we knew the general reveal uh we read in the Bible I just want excuse me I'll just grab my iPad and uh it's in the book of Deuteronomy um in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 32 if we can project it. Deuteronomy 32 uh 39. Deuteronomy 32:39. For those that were there, that's the scripture we read for that day. Deuteronomy 32:39. All righty. And this was the scripture of that day. It says, "See now that I even I am he and there is no God with me. I kill and I make alive and I wound and I heal. Neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand." &gt;&gt; That was the scripture we read that very day that we knew that we were expecting a girl. Uh and just as of the name of the child, um it happens probably uh the year we got married. I think Joseph was not even born yet, but we knew that we were expecting. We were driving to church a Sunday. I think it was July 17, 2022. While driving, I don't know if I had a dream or a vision or whatever. So, while we were driving, I turned straight to my wife. I said, "Take your Bible, write this name down and write the date." And my wife, actually the name, I didn't even know it was a Bible name. So, I just told her, "This is the name that came into my spirit. I don't know if I was dreaming or what. Just write the date next to it and let's, you know, let's move on." Then Joseph was born, you know, uh, and then the baby that we lost was born. And as we were looking for the name of the baby just right there my wife just looked at me and say area do you remember there is a name in the Bible that we had put there and that was the name of the baby and the name of the baby is Kaziah Faith Gongo. So Kaziah is the name of Job's daughter that he had lost when uh after he had lost all his children. So may God bless you tonight. Thank you for your prayers. [Applause] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, dear Lord, we hold this uh gift of life in our hands. So, Father God, we want to thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for being with uh brother Ariel and sister Naisha. Father Lord God and uh especially Lord Sister Nisha, precious Lord of God and uh just as uh he just testified to see what uh they went through and and and here you come oh God father to reward them with another child. Precious Lord children are your heritage. You gave them to us, oh God, to just to be steals, Lord, and that we can learn to commit them back to you this morning in your hands. So, Father, we want to place this life. We ask blessing upon this child and ask that, Father God, Lord Jesus, you will give them all that it takes to be able to bring this child up in the ammonition of the Lord. We pray, oh, Father God, that you will bless her, keep her in good health and strength. Father, Lord, we also pray and ask that Lord God, you will bless the mother, may she recuperate, Lord, may her body, Father, Lord God, every broken cell, so Lord Jesus, come back together, Father. And Lord God, we pray and also ask that you bless the family, Ariel, Naisha, Joseph, and now, Lord God, this little baby. We just ask that father God you bless their home. Make them love father and inspiration an example Lord God an encouragement to many. We just love you this morning. No doubt to God their parents who have love to be here.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying that it says speak the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what was for the deformation or &gt;&gt; that Satan had operated? What Satan had done, God has come to transform it. That's why it speaks of restoration says, it says to be redeemed means to be brought back the way you were you didn't have, you didn't fear. Glory be to God. God is sending &gt;&gt; the same presence, &gt;&gt; the same power, &gt;&gt; the same authority, &gt;&gt; the same spirit is restoring &gt;&gt; so that you you won't be afraid. That's why brother Venom says before the the something has come the blood and flesh and blood cannot stand before a man but he stood there.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He's worthy to be praised. Praise the Lord. Amen. You know God is a God of variety and uh he have uh many wonderful gifts for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Many wonderful gifts for us. You appreciate the word this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know uh uh I love when the brother said uh the promise have the ability when you receive a promise it has it has the ability to change the benefactor. When you have a promise &gt;&gt; it create an expectation in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the promise is God the promises of God in this book if if we are really listening to it if we are not just channeling it through our own mind. Let let me say something to you. Uh uh you know the vision of Ezekiel when God sent Ezekiel over to the dry bones there those were dead bones. And here God asking the prophet Ezekiel can these bones live again? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Being a human, he said, "Lord, you know, I don't know. They are dead bones." But you see, because in God's mind, this was concerning his people to bring them back. Praise the Lord. You see, when he when when the brother was talking about God form us in his image and when the fall came, we were deformed. And now through the cross through Calvary have come to transform us which mean to bring us back. Do you know many times people think that word transform means to change a sinner to a sinner. Not literally what it means. It's true. We are sinners saved by grace. But what it means is to bring us back to who we were. So the transforming power of God is just bringing out of you what is in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about. Uh uh uh we were formed. The devil came through his lies and deform us. He mess with our mind. But the transforming power of God has come to bring that original seed that was in you to bring you back to what you were. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And how God is doing it just like what Ezekiel did by prophesying over the dead bones. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He just prophesied. Just imagine you all we we are all living yet. I don't see any dead person here tonight or this afternoon. And uh but those were dead bones, dry bones in the valley. And all the prophet needed to do was just to keep repeating the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He just kept prophesying over the dead bones and and immediately the the the Bible says there was there was a revival in the valley. The bones started to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see and and and that's the same thing that happen when the word of God is preached &gt;&gt; to sons and daughters of God. When the promise of God, the promises in this book are h are rehearsed over your life. When they are repeated to you, we have to identify it. &gt;&gt; You see many of the times what we trying to do is that we we take church like we are in classroom, we are in school. No, you are not in school. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy. &gt;&gt; So most of what is done is that God is prophesying over your life and you must be there to receive it. &gt;&gt; And say be it unto me that calling to your word. Say amen Lord. Thank you for your word. Thank you for the promises. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Yes. I will restore, say the Lord. I will restore, say the Lord. Jehovah promise, a Holy Ghost promise I will restore. Thou said the Lord and I will restore. Let's stand on our feet now. Oh yeah. I will restore, say the Lord. I will restore, say the Lord. A Jehovah promise, a Holy Ghost promise. I will restore. Thou said the Lord. Yes, I will restore. Oh, hallelujah. I will restore. That's what he said. Power restore, says the Lord. Jehovah promise a Holy Ghost promise. I will restore. Thou said, "Oh yes, I will restore." Oh, come on. Let's worship the Lord now. Oh, I will restore, said the Lord. Yes, I will restore, say the Lord. Jehovah promise, a Holy Ghost promise. I will restore thou, say the Lord. I will restore. Oh, let's receive his word. Yes, I will restore. That's what you said. Lord, I will restore, say the Lord. A Jehovah promise, a Holy Ghost promise. I will restore. Thus, said the Lord. I will restore. Thou said, Oh yes, I will restore. Yes, Lord. That's your word. Oh, I will restore, said the Lord. Jehovah promise. A Holy Ghost promise. I will restore. Thou said the Lord. I will restore, say the Lord. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [Music] Don't be afraid to worship the Lord with your hand clap, people. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. He's worth it to be praised. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I love when he said a closed mouth is a closed destiny. It's truth. &gt;&gt; If you have a problem and you don't speak it, you don't ask anybody or you don't talk about it. Sometimes it's in talking that's when we find solution. A closed mouth is a close destiny. Praise the Lord. We have to speak to the Lord. I was just thinking about that last night. You you see when you look in the Bible, you see how some of these men pray. Look look at Jeremiah. He said he said, "Lord, you deceive me." He said, "You deceive me." Because Jeremiah being a young man, when he received the word and and the word was burning in his heart, the Lord told him, "Go and preach the word. You you are ordained to preach this gospel." But when he went, it was not that easy. The people rejected him. They put him in prison. He said, "Oh God, you your your your word consume him, but I feel deceived. It looks like I'm betrayed." He was not he was not bashing God. He was just speaking the depth of his heart. And sometime God want us to be desperately earnest with him. You can't flatter God. Tell him your heart. Tell him how you feel. [Music] He want us to be desperately earnest with him. I mean you telling God Lord you know you know you know you don't have to tell him you he knows he already knows. He want to know how how you think about your situation, how you feel about your situation. He want you to to speak it out to him. Be earnest and say, "Lord, come true for me." It's been too long. A closed mouth is a close destiny. Praise the Lord. Amen. You might just be moving in a death in a death march. Praise the Lord. Trying to figure things out by yourself, trying to solve your own problem. You might just be going in a death match. Praise the Lord. But one word from the Lord can solve our problem. Let's just bow our heads this afternoon. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we just want to thank you, Lord. Father, many times, Lord God, the the the the preacher comes, he labor in prayer, then labor in steady, Lord, with an inspiration on his heart, oh Father God, and and he brings the word to the people. Sometimes those words are scattered. Oh, Father God is preached, Lord. Father God, sometimes it looks like it goes over our head. Sometimes, oh, Father, we are there. We are trying to see where the preacher is going. We But Lord God, we know that God there is a spiritual body. There is a spiritual atmosphere. Oh father God.
