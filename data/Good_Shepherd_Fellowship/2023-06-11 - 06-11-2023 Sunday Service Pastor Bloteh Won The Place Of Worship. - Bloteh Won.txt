allowing us to be away bring greetings from uh brother flame take and the Seas there in Alaska we had a we had a good meeting with them and uh what a service we had but I I left God in on the dead on Thursday I I think the temperature changed kind of effectively it was a bit warmer year than it was there so because it was warm I never went with a jacket so I forgot I was going to Alaska and then we got in and we had to prepare for the service that night and preach our heart out and so uh trying to break myself with the weather and with a sweating shirt on so I think all of that got a hold of me in a little bit so we got under the weather and and felt a little bit sick but the Lord came down during the meetings and he was able to to bless us with his presence amen good enough I preached Thursday night and then I had to close the service on Sunday so it gave me some time to rest we we had a wonderful time praise the lord we had a wonderful time Saturday night we had a brother Ronnie long but Chris Long's son was preaching Saturday night in what an outpouring we just we just had a time to just worship stay in the presence of the Lord [Music] it's kind of What affected I had this thought on my mind or what I'm going to say this morning but that that kind of prepared me for that I won't hold you long because of the service tonight and also because uh uh I don't think I have all of my strength to preach but we will do the best that we can praise the Lord amen and then we also want to uh salute our graduate I think Mia and Mark and larger and all of these graduates and even my little redeemed graduated from kindergarten and we are all graduate all over the place let's just thank the Lord for each and every one of them [Music] [Applause] thank you we want to thank the Lord for bringing each and each and every one of you out of high school I know that is just the beginning of your of your journey and that's their just the beginning of your journey but we pray that the Lord that brought you through will see you whatever is your career path wherever you want to study we pray that the Lord will make you people great engineers and great doctors because we need more Godly people to be in the workforce amen we need people that can carry the Holy Ghost people that can carry God to work amen we're not only we're not only going to look for money but we're carrying God to work amen that's what you should have on your mind you are carrying more than you're going to receive praise the Lord if you go with that attitude you will be blessed you have to realize you are caring more than you go to receive if you think that you are just going to work because you need a dollar you need more money so you're going to work overtime and you are not valuing what you have what you are carrying when you sit behind your desks when you sit in your break room or wherever you are and you buy your hairs and commit your work your day with your daily work in the hands of the Lord and say Lord bless me bless my hands and bless the things I'm going to do you have to realize you are caring more than you are going to receive because you are honor a promise blessed is he that gave then rest then then he that receive amen so you are going as a giver more than as a receiver you have to keep that in the back of your mind praise the Lord so we pray that the Lord will bless you we pray that the Lord will keep each and every one of you as as you face your future and the other wants to come we are praying for you that the Lord will be able to to uh to also help you get through your status praise the Lord amen we also want to thank the deacons uh followed the service of uh last Wednesday with brother Dan that was that was that was a beautiful beautiful message we thank the Lord for that and uh brother Samuel Taylor he stayed around I think he should be preaching for Brother Don Hoffman this morning if uh if the schedule Remains the Same and so then he will be leaving so we thank our brother for stepping in and speaking to us last Sunday I had to follow the service just before I went to preach three hours distance I mean three hours difference so it helped me to be in church here before I went to church there so we thank the Lord for that praise the Lord and uh yeah before we turn the the order of the service uh once again we have uh Ravi Reef that's the pastor of Gracie Reeves Baptist Church and uh seven of the Lord and as our customers to always respect God seven and I appreciate the love for the work that they are doing and uh despite being my own dear brother and Senior brother but I have a lot of lot of respect and and seeing the work that they have done here I mean it's almost like taking the church from from account for work like Neymar is you know a church that started like just like a a prayer meeting you know in in the home of a mother has now turned to be a big Cathedral they're just finishing their church so we thank the Lord for what he's doing there praise the Lord so he's here visiting with us and Ravi Reeves you are you are welcome it's good to have you thank you [Music] [Applause] you know I was just I was just thinking about it and uh because of uh school and different things growing up uh we we really didn't have much time to spend together as as young younger brothers so I remember the first time he came to pick me up I said remember that he brought a camera he wanted to take our picture wanted to make sure that he get a picture of his little brother so he came and picked me up and then took me out and uh but I was thinking about it that we have this time to spend some time together and we just we talked family life and talk different things and even things around the ministry so is it's been a blessing praise the Lord I have been a blessing to have a bigger brother that will support you in what you are doing amen he support and respect what I'm doing so good to have you Reverend reefs maybe I'll give you a few minutes to come and greet the church and speak you almost becoming a household person because come on [Music] God again [Music] [Applause] am I on Can You Hear Me right so sometimes that's that's pasta things go it gets very difficult for us sometimes there are some instances where it's just overwhelming all that we can do is just give it up to the Lord in prayer a few weeks ago [Music] it was his mother in church whoever Sunday she's about [Music] I guess in her late 70s but strong good move she hardly gained that she could walk with and every Sunday she will come because after service I would just try to remain in my city then people will come so every Sunday should always be the last to come and the first thing once you come up to me she would say pastor don't get tired with me don't get tired of me now I said no I'm not tired with you I will always be here to listen to you so that Sunday I'm talking a few Sundays before the last Sunday in in May [Music] she came in but she was always coming for her grandchildren thinking what her grandchildren would eat for that week [Music] and she will come up to me and say Pastor just this [Music] and I would say just wait around and wait and then I would after service make sure she have something to take home [Music] so that Sunday she came and the women were also planning for their mother's day so she was always in the meeting she didn't have much to give but her presence was always there [Music] so some of them have already volunteered to buy or clothes that they will be wearing that on that Mother's Day and Monday after service she was in the community moving [Music] Tuesday morning she woke up Coke got dressed just got dressed wore her skirt blouse she tied her head [Music] and people in the community said she walked around apparently she was just telling people goodbye and then she went in her room not even just lie down and die oh [Music] so I was at work and he called me then you wear to take her body so I said okay you'll just wait when I get off work I will come over [Music] so I went over and then I think it was around 6 30 7 called those of you from Library Road Anderson Funeral Home and it came and so when it came to check out about it I managed to just slip in to just see see her just lying and I I saw her dress up as if she was ready to go and then they put her in the bag I'm saying all of this to say it is it is always good to give God praise because we don't know the next movement what may happen to us right [Music] it's always good to give him praise [Music] so this morning as we [Music] one of the passage that uh spoke to me through the week was Genesis 8 verse 22. I don't know what you can put it on the screen in the body [Music] it says the Earth we mean it sea time and harvest coal and Heat summer and winter night and day shall not cease [Music] so if you look at all of those things that are mentioned there are two events that we have control over and that is I will see time and I will have as time cool and Heat is in God's hand he control when to make the place forward to make it hard he controls when someone and winter comes he controls day and night for sea time and Harvest Time are in our control he allowed us so what are we doing with our sea time because there will be a harvest [Music] but if you don't soar you will not Harvest [Music] the best thing that you can sow is your life I know that on that great get in the morning you will have it your life again [Music] so we want to thank God for the opportunity to see all of you again I bring you greetings from my family and my church who pray that God bless all of us and keep all of us in Jesus name amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign amen I wanted to sing a song but I don't have the voice too so thank you musicians that would be it for singing and then we would just uh try to go right into the world like I said I won't keep you long this morning I want to go back to uh Saint John chapter 4. we started speaking on generation conflict and then the last time we spoke from there was knew the gift of God so we want to go back to Genesis I mean say John chapter 4. thank you very Reeves there's a that's that's what I I love that verse but that inspiration was was was wonderful praise the Lord their inspiration was wonderful looking at the seating time and the Harvest Time praise the Lord and we don't have control over uh the winter in summer neither the day and night God controls that but he has he has called us as laborers in his field praise the Lord he has bought the seed of the word in our hands so in the sense of having control over your yours your seeding and harvest time is it all depends on what you are doing with your work with the word what you are doing with your life praise the Lord so that's I mean that was a wonderful inspiration that was a wonderful inspiration I'm going to uh my brother say I'm going to keep their honor my faith rape okay and I will use it whenever it's lethal praise the Lord we we want to look at the St John chapter four we want to look at Saint John chapter 4. let's read from verse 1 when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees have heard that Jesus made and and baptized more disciples than John though Jesus himself baptized net but his disciples he left Judea and departed into Galilee and he must go and he must need go through Samira then cometh he to the city of Samira which is called soccer amen now that that that city is important because uh in the in uh in the Old Testament we would Trace that try to trace that a little bit back you will see that uh because the Old Testament was translated in Hebrew the New Testament was translated in Greek so there are there are places where you find like the in the New Testament there in Matthew they will call Elijah Elias you know those kind of pronunciation so this city of sakat is the same as searching the first place that Abraham uh made an altar to the Lord but what what brings it what brings it into Clarity is that then coming he to the city of Samira which is called Shaka near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob well was there Jesus therefore been wearing with his journey set us on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of Samira to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciple were gone away onto the city to buy meat then said the woman of Samira unto him how is it that thou being the Jews acts drink of me which I'm a woman of Samira for the Jews have no dealing so there's there was that word where we identified as a place of conflict have no dealing with the Samaritans and Jesus answered and said unto her if that kneweth the gift of God and who it is that said unto thee give me to drink thou who they have asked of him and he who have given the Living Water praise the Lord the Lord bless you you can have your seat while we continue to read the woman said unto him sir there have nothing to draw with and the world is deep from Wayne's then have doubt that Living Water they are greater than our father Jacob which gave us the wealth and also if you if you go back and look into into Genesis Jacob's Well was in a shashem so uh the the Greek had that city called soccer but it's the same and I'm saying that because I want to I want to use a little uh uh map here to be able to create a picture of what we want to talk about this morning laughs praise the Lord at that greater verse 12 I die greater than our father Jacob which gave us the wealth and drained there of himself and his children and his cattles Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water sprinkling up into everlasting life and the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I touched neither come here to drink Jesus said you know go call your husband and uh and uh and you know that go and call your husband the woman answered Jesus I have no husband he said there there has well said I have no husband fall down have had five husbands and he whom they are now he whom there now have is not the houseman in their Syria they are the truth the woman said unto him sir I perceive that there are a prophet now she she came to that conclusion because uh Jesus have just discerned her need Jesus had just descended what she was dealing with praise the Lord more than the conflict of Jews and Gentiles she had an internal conflict going on so Jesus was able to discern that need they have brought her to the place of uh of uh recognizing that this could be a Prophet this could be a man of God the woman said I perceived thou I a prophet our fathers Worship in this mountain and yes say that in Jerusalem is the place where men are to worship now that's what I want to do this morning the place of worship I want to talk a little bit on the place of worship praise the Lord amen I want to speak a little bit on the place of worship so I pray that the Lord will be able to bless each and every one of you like the text message went out uh sister Merritt is doing a little better in the hospital praise the lord we used to do one MRI so they can kind of figure out what's what's going on there with with her heart I think she had a more like a panic attack uh but her heart was completely out of balance out of reading it was you know it was just completely written and she she went she blocked out for a while not knowing what was happening around her so it was good that I that someone was there to be able to call the ambulance to take her to the hospital but by the grace of God she's doing much better they have they have stabilized her and uh and the they are trying to just understand what's happening with her system praise the Lord and that's that's what's going to live we want to greet our sister back there also I see his sister back there into fellowship with us we pray that the law will make the service a blessing to you praise the Lord now this would this would be more like uh uh you know one of those one of those servants were you keep asking yourself what is the preacher doing this is going to be one of the services praise the Lord or you keep asking yourself what is the preacher doing amen what is the government that looks like he's just going around a tough year but yeah we we want to look at this just like I said uh uh I want to I want to look at a place of worship uh uh and and and that we give give us a little view here to see how uh uh this woman might have come into this place of conflict of uh of uh of saying the other the the Samaritans have no dealing with the Gentiles when both of them are claiming Jacob as their father amen both of them I claim you right to Jacob's Well they are claiming the Patriots as their father then but then where came the division where came uh uh the the the the Discrimination for how to think that uh uh Jacob I mean to think that the the Samaritans have no dealing with the Jews but this would take us back to the book of Deuteronomy if you want to get a clear picture of this you will have to go back to the the book of Deuteronomy and there is something I want for us to study together so let's do that as we go back to Deuteronomy chapter 27. this book is is sometimes called by some Scholars as the book of two laws it's now actually two laws it is just that Moses is rehearsing he's now rehearsing reminding the people about the adjoining and everything that he has said to them that's what is happening he's coming to the end of his days praise the Lord he's coming to the end of his days and right here over in uh uh this chapter is going to is going to lay before the people he's going to lay before the people some very important things and I want for us to to study there together let's read from verse 27 verse 1 I mean verse 1 chapter 27. and Moses were the others of Israel commanded the people saying keep all the Commandments which I command you this day and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord that God gaveth they that thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaster them with plastered and thou shall write upon them all the words of this Lord when thou art pass over that thou may go in onto the land which the Lord thy God give it thee and land that floureth with milk and honey as the Lord as as the Lord God of the fathers have promised thee praise the Lord therefore it shall be when ye when ye be gone over Jordan that yesha set up these Stones which I command you this day in Mount EBA and thou shall plaster them with plaster and there shall thou build an altar unto the Lord that God and altar of stones Thou shalt not lift up any iron tools upon them praise the Lord and all sort of stones you will just gather the stones and bring it together there is no breaking there is no knocking just take the stones and bring them together build an altar Thou shalt Bill verse says thou shall build the altar of the Lord thy God of whole stones and thou shalt offer burn offering there on unto the Lord thy God and thou shall offer peace offering and shall eat there and rejoice before the Lord thy God and they all shall write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly praise the Lord amen now so with this setting is is uh is is giving us and uh you know what an idea of the stones that Joshua gathered from the Jordan and the bill and Altar and uh uh and we know that there were there was another heap of stones that were built in the midst of Jordan and there was another altar that was built uh uh out of Jordan so they had 12 Stones in Jordan and 12 Stones Out of Jordan and uh yeah Moses is asking the people to plaster those stones and they will write the Commandments of the Lord to be able to remind him there was there's a reason for that there's a reason the purpose here is that uh God wanted the people to remember that God performed his promises praise the Lord God performed When God Says something he performed his promises and and and and the writing of The Commandments on those stones was to remind the people that the breaking of them into the promised land was based on his promised word right praise the Lord it was not only because they have suffered in Egypt because you have to realize it was not only the children of Israel that was in Egypt Egypt was a superpower at that time and they have conquered many nations yes but it was only these people that had a promise that after 400 years God says I will come down and I will bring you out with a mighty hand right it was only the Jews it was only the Hebrews that had a promise they're all the people that were in Egypt that were you know that were captured by the Egyptian army they never had a promise right only these people had a promise now so God yeah was reminding them they will always keep the words of the Lord before them so they can remember that it is based on his work based on his promises that he's dealing with us praise the Lord amen it is not based on how sorrowful we are or what our need is there are people that are more needed than us praise the Lord you look in yummy and and other parts of the word there there there are they are starving people they are homeless people so you see God was trying to remind him that they might always keep before them that God performed his promises amen praise the Lord and then also here you will see it as you as you go down with the reading that Moses brought them to to this place of these two mountains and actually this place of session soccer was right in the Valley of the two mountains that Moses is going to talk about here right in uh Deuteronomy chapter 27 this place where this woman was turning and saying that we Samaritan we worship God on this mountain and you say it's in Jerusalem that the law that that God should be worshiped she was standing in the valley of the very same Mountain where Moses was talking about praise the Lord and as we as we read instead of yeah you will realize uh uh uh these two mountains are described as the mountain of curse and the mountain of blessing Mount Eva was the mountain of curse man Garrison was the mountain of blessing and as she's standing in this Valley she's referring to these two places and saying that our father said it is on this mountain which is Mount Garrison that we should worship and you say this in Jerusalem is praise the Lord is the picture coming together praise the Lord but before we go we go father Moses will take the he would take the the the the Psalms of the Patriot the hands of the tribe and he will take six of them and identify them with each of the mountains you know praise the Lord amen and we can we can go into all of their verse 11 and Moses charged the people saying these days uh charge the people the same they're saying they shall stand upon my Garrison and then he called the name of all the ones that we stand on my Garrison and then he he also deal with the ones that will stand on Eber we can go into that and and but there are some things I want us to look at before we go any further from verse 14 . [Music] don't worry we'll find our place of worship amen you know you read the scripture and you read about the different cities that was in Bible days the word has not changed that's right cities have only developed amen and with the development of those cities they might change their names praise the Lord but the word has not changed you can travel and take and take uh uh and take and take the Bible and Trace every city that is written in this Bible you can trace it and you will still find it where it is it might have been affected by an earthquake it might have been affected by some some disaster but the word is still the same praise the Lord a blessed memory but George Martin's uh uh he just want to be with the Lord that is in in South Africa he's uh he's a good uh uh teacher in the world and and uh uh he was able to uh uh he was able to get a recognition from the Israeli government because he took the Bible to be able to show them a place by the scripture that this is the place that the Bible was talking about and they sent researcher and archaeologist there and they were able to realize that George Martin was saying exactly the truth I can remember the name of the city but the Israeli government gave him a recognition for that that he was able to identify a place in Israel by the scripture very very great teacher very great teacher now so we come down here to verse 14 the Bible says and the Levi shall speak and say unto the men of Israel with a loud voice now I want you to pay attention to this I want you to pay attention to this curse be the man that maketh an engraving image or Martin image an Abomination unto the Lord The Works of the hands of craftmen and Potter it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say is all the people here are there people here let the people answer and say Amen [Music] curse be he that's the Satellite by his father or his mother and all the people shall saying curse be he that remove his labor his neighbor's landmark and all the people shall saying amen cares be he them that maketh the blind to wander out of the way and all the people shall say [Music] curse be he thou perverted the Judgment of the stranger the fatherless and the Widow and all the people shall Say Amen praise the Lord now the reason why I'm doing this is because you will realize Moses here is instructing the Levites on this Mount of Eva he's now presenting them the the the the curse wow why God will take his Blessing away now the thing that is powerful there is that if you just have some time and you read those last uh words of Moses you will realize that everything that the Jews went through from the time of the Roman Titus General to the time of Hitler Moses prophesied about it right here in Deuteronomy chapter 28 he's tell them that if you don't if you don't keep the word of the Lord you Lord you see your own children you will go into captivity praise the Lord during the time of the Holocaust there was there was a woman that that the handsome Jews away and and the Lord blessed what she was doing and uh uh uh and and she was able to survive out of there so over over the years the Jews have had many recognition for hurting you know they were they would say to her place and so one time they were there that I I was just listening to to that story couple of weeks or maybe the month ago and there were one there were one uh uh Jew that was that was that was that was very language as they went through you know people will tell some of the Holocaust Survivors they would tell their stories and all of that and then he he stood up and said he said where was our God when our parents were going through this and everywhere were quiet he says and we read through the scripture how we went through the the the the the Captivity in Egypt we read through the Bible how we went through we suffer in the hands of the Assyrians we suffer in the hands of Babylon that we suffer in the hands of Roman how can you say that uh that that that the god Elohim is our God everywhere was quiet praise the Lord there was one old rubber stood up and said Son it's true that we went through this and we went through that and you know in Egypt and he you know he went he said all of that then he caught her from the Torah Genesis 20 I mean Deuteronomy 28. and he started to go through all of that the Lord Our God says if we will not keep the keep the Commandment these were the curses that would come upon us you know why they went into Babylon because they never gave the land it's rest they were supposed to work seven years and and leave one year six years and live one year as as a Sabbath the land was supposed to have a sabbah right praise the Lord God means what he says you were created by the word of God and God is not going to change his word to fit your present situation he means what he says praise the Lord but what I wanted you to realize here as we read this you will realize that when when the priest said this point in tall man even telling the people curse is he that will lay with a man curses he that would not respect his neighbor a landmark the people will say Amen amen and all the people were saying is the people here this morning and all the people were saying but when you come over to Genesis I mean Deuteronomy 28 when Moses tell the priests to now proclaim the blessing praise the Lord look in the scripture you will realize that 20 and verse 1 and and it shall come to pass a thou if thou shall yaken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and do all his commitment which I commanded this thing that the Lord that God will set thee on high above all nations of the Earth amen and all these blessings shall come and be an overtake thee come on praise the Lord amen and all the blessings will come upon thee and Alma take thee and thou shall yanking onto the voice of the Lord thy God blessed shall thou be in the city and blessed shall thou be in the field but you see the people never say Amen [Music] the people never said amen oh I know it was going to be a wow moment when the Levites proclaim the curses yeah the people said all the people said amen right when the Levi proclaim the blessing the people never say Amen praise the Lord I can have you to stand up we prayed and go home praise the Lord and then have your mind working the rest of the week praise the Lord I was talking to a young couple that I needed to visit wave and I had an appointment to to meet them in and for some reason I was so tired and and for God until it reminded me that we were supposed to meet and they were waiting for me at the church and uh and it was rush hour time I got stuck in traffic never got here until the appointment time passed so I called them and I told him I said well you're just wait for me I'll meet you and I just want to apologize that uh I hire you people waiting all of their time so they waited and then regarding we prayed and talked to them a little bit and I told him I said well I will allow you to go but having one thing that I want you to think about and don't answer me now when we meet the next time you can tell me what you think about it so I told him I said what will be the difficult thing what would be the thing that yo fiancee the future husband wife would do that would be so difficult they kept quiet then the guy say I know and she said what's that I knew I had your mind working until I meet them next time praise the Lord so I could do the same here to you and tell you let's pray then go home and then just have your mind working until we meet the next time but I won't do that to you amen I won't do that to you but this this particular scripture for many many many years have my mind I've cut my mind out since what what could be this you know and and I think I think recently the law kind of helped me especially when I was studying on this subject he helped me to be able to see a little bit got a little insight on on what was going on here you see God always bring his people uh uh the the the you know the the blessings of God I mean there is there is uh you know all of these all of these uh uh Prosperity Gospel you know that will make you to think that you need to do this to be blessed you need to do this to be blessed amen the Bible says when God made man he blessed him amen when God made man he blessed him praise the Lord you know what it takes for almighty God to go against his Lord to curse you yeah yeah praise the Lord he wants you to be happy he wants you to be healthy amen he wants you to always have a peace of mind like John said above everything I wish that you prosper even as your soul prosperous [Music] that's God's desire right amen it is man's effort that brought him to the curse our effort trying to uh uh either bring the blessing quickly or go ahead of go ahead of God that bring us to this place of the curse praise the Lord now there is something important that we're going to a steady here this morning you realize that this is the place where Jesus said he made this profound statement when he said it is neither on this mountain neither on that mountain right praise the Lord but the true worshipers will worship God in spirit and in truth praise the Lord so now God is is now particular about what church and by one building God is particular about his people stepping into the place of worship stepping into his choosing place of worship His chosen place of worship is not a building it's not on a brand name praise the Lord because those places one one mountain kept us under the curse Another Mountain uh try to bring us into an overnight blessing churches find themselves right in the valley of soccer with the religious word that is before them amen one system from the Roman Church and all of his daughters and keeping the church under the curse right amen and then we have another character movement now that there are standard Prosperity Gospel right praise the Lord yes sir but let's study this together and all about this who have caught your attention and this will be the breaking point I can I can drive the nail right right on this amen [Music] now so God brings the people to this place okay and he's asking the levite after all the the the the the curses will be proclaimed to the people let the people respond and says amen and what does Amen means so be it be it unto me yeah yeah if I don't keep your word let that be upon me let that be upon my children let her be upon me praise the Lord amen hallelujah and it's completely different when I was thinking about this study because uh uh uh when you come to that place of of of of of of of of of menstruating you know and telling the people how you know how the Lord will bless you and prosper you and we can all say Amen to that but when you get on the nail and then start by the the evangelists come and start rebuking the people you know and calling our sin the whole church go quiet we get the whole thing reversed praise the Lord when the Holy Ghost is rebuking us that's what we're supposed to be saying amen praise the Lord Jesus speak that to me praise the Lord but we get the whole thing reverse we go quiet when the Holy Ghost is rebuking us we get offended we take some sense of comfort when we when we're hearing about blessing and we will be prosperity and how the law will be with us we take some sense of comfort right never be with me this day praise the Lord but God approach is different because God primary purpose his purpose his desire for his children is so blessing God don't have to go into any agreement to bless you right but he brings you into an agreement that if you don't keep my word this is going to happen to you and when it's happening to you you must realize it's because of your own failure you can't say God why everybody is there why why is this happening you must look at yourself he's saying let it greet upon this if you remove your your your neighbor lean back there's a curse that is going to come upon you because that is that is something that you must not do yeah praise the Lord do you always feel like you know it's it's always it's it's it's it's it's it's in parenting it's a blind spot it's a blind spot it's imperative it's it's a marriage relationship it almost looks like uh uh when we are doing well we are never praise it's just all it just it just it just when we make mistake right that you talk about it if there's something that is in a blind spot amen we must be able to affirm when people are doing well we must we we must encourage them to do well but you see the reason why stocked on those things are in the in in a blind spot is because we are expected to do well right that's that is what is expected of us yes praise the Lord that's the reason why I always fall like that that is whenever you are stepping stepping out then you know somebody will say something about it right because you are not expected to go in the wrong path you are not expected to say the wrong thing what is suspected of you is or we can't wait for the days for the Millennium to come amen when Satan is Bound for a thousand years praise the Lord Hallelujah you will not have to worry about making mistake because you will not make mistake you will not have to worry I mean if you have to think twice before you say the truth you will not have to think twice the truth will flow out of your mouth because Satan will be bound for a thousand years are we together so do you grab the picture wow the people were required to say Amen to another curses praise the Lord Hallelujah I believe that uh that is the way they must be to the True Believer when God speaks to us and he rebuked us we must be Lord help me praise the Lord Lord help me because I know you are calling me to a higher height amen you are calling me to a better life and blessed is he that is now offended in me blessed is he that will not take offense in the word because the word does not come to offend you no the world comes to make you better are we together so let's go now into into dealing with this with this uh with this mountain if uh if uh the Saints back there can just put my little map up here praise the Lord if they can put our map up here okay so you see the I don't have my my point in stone here but you see here is Samara up there and here's the two mountains and Jesus and this woman was right down here in this Valley of shashim so right there in the valley they were looking at the two mountains they are looking at Mount Eva and they're looking at Mount Garrison man Garrison was supposed to be the mountain of blessing maniba was supposed to be the mountain of curse another thing I want you to watch in the scripture year is that there was not an altar built in mangerezi praise the Lord because I know how to use this fence I think okay brother Jordan can you come and save me okay yes yes this one is much easier than that one okay yeah this one is much easier I won't get too much button now so yeah our mountains we are right here and then if you look at this you'll realize that there are a lot of mountains Here Mount Nimble my calendar with uh uh Elijah and all of that but this is right here where we are we are right here this this will kind of bring out the the picture better for you now another thing I want us to realize when you go back again to chapter 27. now these things were written for us yeah the New Testament does not come into a full light until we see the things that God bless you praise the Lord yeah now so you'll realize in Mao in in in chapter 27 in Mount Eva God told Moses foreign if you if if we read which of course we just read there the Bible says in verse 4 of 27 therefore it shall be when they go over job and take the stones in Mount EBA and plaster it and verse 5 the Bible says and there shall you build an altar so there is an altar that is built in Mount evil and on the altar verse 6 Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of whole stones and thou shall offer burn offering thereon and thou shall offer peace offering but if you go to chapter 28 when you read about uh man Garrison there was no altar that was built on my jersey [Music] praise the Lord amen there was no altar that was built now it brings also to light for us to understand what is the order for praise the Lord the first altar that was built was built in Eden and almighty God himself build that altar when he took alarm and slay the line and he was going to bring his children back into Fellowship so you see the altar is built to deal with the curse sir praise the Lord the altar is built to deed with the curse that's the reason why the altar was in the mountain of curse praise the Lord when we get on the other side and into Glory we want to have no evangelists who have no preacher will not need missionary right we will all worship the land amen praise the lord we will all worship the land this is word we need the preaching of the word now so you see here as as we look at this together now it gave us the picture here come here read some things to you okay I'm almost getting out of time here I read some things to you uh let's see so we go through our subject yeah now so it brings us to the place where the the this this this this uh uh uh predestinated seed uh uh future home uh he said that that Samaritan woman had a predestinated seeing her amen it was a predestinated sea that was quickened in heard that made her to say I perceive that you are a prophet praise the Lord why all of those priests and sahidras council could not see it but that woman with the with the condition of her life praise the Lord she's going through all of this confusion she having a relationship confusion she having religion confusion she even had a confusion with her whole people that she that she have to come out in a certain time of the day she's dealing with all of this confusion but down in her sword is a predestinated sea praise the Lord down in her sword is a predestinated seed and what she needed is the word to break the curse she needs a word to break the curse for that seed to come to life [Music] praise the Lord Hallelujah you appreciate the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of praise glory be to God [Applause] glory be to God now so Jesus yet is addressing this woman she said I perceive that you are a prophet and she jumped into her religious shoes our father said it's on this mountain Garrison that we must worship you say this in Jerusalem but he said the hour has come praise the Lord the hour has come I don't know whether you have come into that hour yet maybe you are still on your mind Garrison or your man Eva but Jesus said that hour has come praise the Lord oh I hope the hour can break upon us this morning I hope the hour can break upon us this morning because people have got so stuck into those mountains that no matter how the word is the the abrilian spirit is so stuck that they cannot bring praise to God amen we either have to go on the mount ever with them and play the music of Mount ever and even if you out there with them they were still not praise God because God is not going to receive those Praises on the curse amen he's not going to receive the the the the the the the the uh the worship for my Garrison they don't even have any hotter [Music] they have a promise but they don't have an altar and we cannot worship without an altar but the hour has come the hour has come I praise the Lord amen that's why the son of man Ministry is to do is to bring us into the hour of true worship [Music] is to take us out of our tradition our starchiness [Music] you have all the drums you have the instrument you have everything but yeah we cannot bring worship to God right man the hour has come me praise the Lord just like that son of man Ministry abroad they are predestinate as he into true worship she never needed to wait for a church door to open she stood right there and said can I see tonight amen amen right when you break into the hour that's why it would do to you praise the Lord it will do to you you will worship God in the middle of the street amen you will worship God behind your wheels you will worship God you will not have to wait for the music to play you will worship God you will bring worship appreciation to him now pleasing yourself the hour has come glory be to God hallelujah she was telling you on the very same ground where God met Abraham the first time amen the first place that Abraham built an altar there was no church building praise the Lord Abraham just came out of idolatry just came out of Babylon God there with his heart he built an altar amen and he worshiped God no Strange Music but he was able to bring washing to God praise the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah are you are you ready to worship God I don't care how we we we we pop you with the music I don't care how we say worship God shout hallelujah shall Glory you never come to that place until you come to this hour that is break upon us amen tell you yeah the voice of the son of man Ila in that mountain oh on this mountain the hour has come where the Father seeketh the truth worshipers praise the Lord lead up our church crease or our denominational status the hour has come all of those things that's what broad generation conflict upon us when one group think they are better than another group [Music] praise the Lord all this is why we believe all that is why we believe and with all of that we have not been able to bring worship we have not been able to bring worship yes if we are worshiping God why should why should you be offended in the music right it's God that's supposed to be offended why should you be offended yes sir when your worship is on to God you pass the music you go into the holy place [Applause] I'm not making excuses for my poor voice amen and I'm making excuses when I spoil the song right praise the Lord but I'm trying to say is that the hour has come the hour is upon us [Music] praise the Lord who are the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit any truth praise the Lord where the truth worshipers will worship the father a spirit and in truth Hallelujah are we together we are just read a couple of things here we can pick this up another time there's some other few things that we have loved to go into but time is that much on my side I don't care how many how much time you give me I will never be able to preach finish my message because I'm such a poor preacher amen not very organized like some uh glory be to God because of this this generation conflict because of all of this conflict that came right down from our birth that runs into our genetics you know have all become part of religious conflict in all of the things that we deal with praise the Lord it has put us to the place word when man comes to worship many of the times we come with this concept on our mind wanting God to bless the things that we are doing right amen praise the Lord which of course also is a vehicle that is moving in reverse because we must do the things that God is blessing yes sir praise the Lord we must do the things we must be able to identify what God is doing right praise the Lord but the people come with the mindset wanting God to bless the things that we are doing praise the Lord instead of identifying what God is doing or what God is blessing even in your own life and in your own family and in your own home to do what God is blessing praise the Lord people across from Christ is the mystery of God revealed I've always loved this this statement he saw is this this has been uh when I when I really started understanding that this this has been very outstanding to me for a long time what brings me here or what brings us here is you people see this church I tell you all this place I've I've I've went ever in my life all places that whenever in my life this is the February place to come preach the gospel and and look like that we can make tips from here 10 times better than anything but this is what has stuck out to me see that's the reason I said where God is doing something then stay right there stay right with that what God is doing what he's blessing that's what you have to look for that's what you have to look for any young people in a path of career it's not just wages it's not just how many money we can make because you can make all of the money and then you start being enslaved by the money but you have to watch for what God is doing if he's making you a blessing on the job and you realize that you are carrying his presence if you identify that that I have a purpose here you find people that jump from one place to another not on a job but people that run from one city to another for the church that goes to this place looking for the best church when they get there the church is no more good for them right amen especially in the streaming environment that we have they sit online they stream all the service is beautiful the service is beautiful when the people are online they are all injuries praise the Lord they are all Angels because you don't get a feeling with them you don't feel them you don't feed their vibe they're all angels but when you come down and walk into the congregation then you realize oh I've been looking at humans all of this one praise the Lord right you find people just in this Wilderness condition moving from one place to another they can never settle down why because they have not identified what God is doing they are looking for what they will do that God will bless don't bring God in a reverse right are you telling me there is nothing that God is blessing on the Earth until what you will be doing find what he's doing identify stay with it yes sir and God will bless you because you have already identified what he's doing you are already blessed you are already it's a blessing it's already there right right it will just start unfolding it will start opening to you it's there the blessings of God is all around us find what he's doing is he making you a blessing to the people are the people are blessing to you praise the Lord no because we we we we get into this place of of of of of where we want to be safe we don't want to get our hands dirty we don't want to be servants sure so we sit back and just like getting to the restaurant you sit there on the table not realizing that you met hundreds of people sitting down and when they can't get up to you you get up you slander the menu on the table and you walk out I've been sitting there all of this wine sure press one if you would just talked to one of the stewards pretty soon you realize how busy they are maybe there is one man behind there that is cooking and all of these people are waiting for their food We Gather you just slam the table and go home and cook for yourself sure but you see that's the mentality of the people because we want to be safe they don't create no passion in us for us to bear with people that they are not doing it right but they are doing something sir praise the Lord father seek as such to worship Him the father seeketh such to worship Him yes praise the Lord that we worship Him in spirit and in truth people have we realized that have we realized out of these years we have just been building one other denomination they're listening to the voice of the son of man calling us to the hour of true worship calling us to the hour what is the hour of true worship is the hour where you were delivered your true representation yes that you are a son of God and you have to live like a son of God you have to dress like a son of God right [Music] you're right amen do we realize that praise the Lord Hebrew exposition I read this and if we can get through it then we close we all to give the most and it's heed to the things which we have heard that's why Paul said the things which we have heard we have to give the most Earnest heed we have to yell ourselves to that right not not make something out of what we have heard all of these years we've been making things out of what we have heard that's why gave us all of the different doctrines because we take one chord and one scripture and we try to make a Doctrine yeah why we are better than them we have to heed give it surround ourself to the things that we have heard because there's a voice that is calling us calling us at an hour of Truth worship why type of people are we to be when we see the great Jehovah come down and do the things that he does praise the Lord honor the time of the Revival and all of these Great Men praise the Lord so see the things that he have done that we are not serving a dead God we are serving a living God that is among his people praise the Lord but rolling the young man preaching there he was just he was testifying about uh uh uh uh a situation there down in in in South Carolina but this this situation happened and and the young man gave his heart back to the Lord that in South Carolina this young man grew on under the message Fair frustrated and gave his and gave himself over to a trans life praise the Lord lost his identity and becoming something else and one night he will have a dream of being in the tribulation a dream that troubled him so much that when he woke up from sleep you see it's it's not how loud we preach and Shout at you is how much this world can get down to your heart how much this work and get down to your soul he woke up from sleep with a sweat all over his body and everything that he heard in church from a little boy starts to play back to his mind praise the Lord came back to church rededicate his heart back to the Lord yeah and God delivered him of that perverted spirit [Music] praise the Lord not letting God stay here Among Us if we would just give heed to the face not be smart on the things that we have heard but give heed to the things that we have heard what type of people are we to be the secret Jehovah come down and do the things that he does and see them comparing scripture with scripture and a little bit that we can do try to do this morning bring you right back into the foundation this is the foundation of Saint John chapter 4. you can read it and queen it all the ways you want to acquaint it but take it back take it back to the to its original Moses they're instructing the people giving them his last words that they comparing scripture with scripture that they are the truth and we sit around sometimes watch on the Lord and just so all concerned unconcerned and yet we think that we are worshiping God praise the Lord and sometimes when the Holy Ghost try to call a person out we get offended by that with the time that we are living in all of the things that is happening around us how can we be unconcerned about our spiritual life how can we be all concerned about our family life right how can we be your own concerned about even the Church of the Living God how can we be all concerned when we know that it's not getting better praise the Lord we have never had a time in the word where the word has been occupied by a bunch of scammers right praise the Lord scare me people right from the pulpit scamming people in the hospital amen a young man down there in Florida I got some kind of a fake degree never been out of high school preacher doctor degree who rented a place and wrote run in a clinic praise the Lord a group of of hard-working people That Base came of all their retirement because somebody told them you can skip your money in gold and they send their money to him he's over in Dubai it's not funny it's not funny it's a spirit because if you have not got your money it's robbing you of the presence of God so with all of these things how can we set just being unconcerned all of the things that is in that that is now being introduced into schools how can we sit there and be unconcerned not working with our children not not involving them we ought to be busy at every minute trying to get people to Christ we ought to be lifeless stones we should never be satisfied like we are praise the Lord we must always challenge ourselves always challenge ourselves praise the Lord how just following the knowledge documentary or for the progression of all of these uh uh our DNA think over there in Iceland they having one of the biggest DNA accompanied and now they have come up with a DNA research that can tell you when you would die and what you may die of it should not surprise you because we're carrying death in this body yes sir it's there it's just that you don't know when it will just cut you off but is it when you are dragging it every day right so it must not surprise you the same way they can read your bloodstream and tell where your family coming from now they are reading the bloodstream to see our sicknesses that runs through your bloodstream and what may cause your death right you see and all of these people in a science World in their mind in their mind is that we can make the world better because they said it's not to scare people but if you can do the test and know why may cause your death you can start working on it right at least they are trying to do something to to help Humanity to help the people that believe in it [Music] now we can sit there and just be criticizing everything and you don't have nothing in your heads we don't have nothing in our hands what are we doing to make the world better even for our children right praise the Lord and the people say and the people say [Music] we should never be slothful like we are and we'll go up to church and we will see the Lord Jesus do something or bless us in such a way and we will go back out and say very nice meeting I enjoy the service and that's where it stopped I enjoy the service that's where it stopped praise the Lord instead of taking that word it's the Lord Jesus you bless me in here you spoke to me here I believe I can Rise Above This right now the preaching of the word we enjoyed I'm I should close here now but that's not the me thing we should not Worship the Lord just after we get through preaching the word as we usually do just worship him that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our life when we are at work we should worship Him praise the Lord every time the opportunity to presents itself Worship the Lord by testifying of him praise the Lord when that woman got caught when she got captured by the son of man Ministry she worshiped him by saying come and see the man that told me all the things she was not ashamed of her testimony she was bringing worship to him yes yes all the

wrong Worship the Lord by taking her and saying sister there's a better life than this by just giving encouragement and comfort to someone not thinking that you are better than the person and despising them and criticizing them but getting down you are worshiping the Lord worshiping God in spirit any truth it's not only about the pops organ right God all through his word James in the Book
