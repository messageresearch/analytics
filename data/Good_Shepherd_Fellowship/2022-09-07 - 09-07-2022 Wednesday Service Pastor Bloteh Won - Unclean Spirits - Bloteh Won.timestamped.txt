[46:57] uh uh is is good to be in the house of
[47:00] the Lord praise the Lord and I want to
[47:03] find out that we ended the uh man
[47:08] running away from the presence of the
[47:10] Lord that we ended that tape let's go on
[47:12] Sunday okay I got the feeling of faith
[47:15] praise the Lord
[47:17] and
[47:19] what I wanted to do tonight I wanted to
[47:22] kind of catch up some few points on that
[47:25] tape that brother Brandon County for
[47:28] emphasized on now you have to remember
[47:30] it is the beginning of a series that led
[47:33] to the mauritian Devils uh message so
[47:37] brother Branham was kind of for building
[47:39] up in and preparing the people before he
[47:42] preached marriage and davosa uh uh the
[47:45] weekend and then he will also preach the
[47:47] message who uh who is this uh matricide
[47:51] so uh we want to we we will follow the
[47:56] series uh and uh and see if the law will
[48:00] be able to bless us to to recap every
[48:02] time we come to an end of a tip that's
[48:05] what I wanted to do today but uh I was
[48:09] praying uh this morning
[48:13] and then uh
[48:17] you know kind of travel back and and had
[48:22] a little bit of a tough time to sleep
[48:24] last night tired and and different
[48:27] things and and uh and you know the enemy
[48:30] always try to profit when your body is
[48:32] weak amen praise the Lord he always
[48:35] tried to profit and and want to
[48:37] frustrate your nighting you know and
[48:39] just put you in there
[48:41] so uh but then you know I uh sometime in
[48:45] the morning I was praying and and then
[48:49] uh I remember last Wednesday we had a
[48:54] wonderful prayer meeting praise the Lord
[48:56] wonderful prayer meeting that led into
[48:58] uh uh uh brother Stephen ajaro testimony
[49:02] he gave and then speaking about you know
[49:06] uh uh against all unclean Spirit giving
[49:10] power the man he picks that right off
[49:12] from the quickening power message that
[49:14] brother Valentin Prayed For Us Praise
[49:17] the Lord and uh and sometimes it's
[49:19] wonderful when the Holy Ghost can do
[49:21] that amen because that's exactly what
[49:24] the gift's supposed to do they give
[49:26] supposed to be able to pick up from from
[49:28] uh from where the Holy Ghost is dealing
[49:31] with the people so uh
[49:34] and then he brought that message and uh
[49:37] uh you know and and he he gave us an
[49:40] assignment I don't know who all had the
[49:43] courage to go back and and look at uh
[49:46] scriptures or quotes on unclean Spirit
[49:48] anyone was able to take the courage to
[49:51] do that praise the Lord and uh and
[49:55] and uh I I I think that it was it was a
[49:59] wonderful it was a wonderful uh uh
[50:03] message it was a wonderful hesitation
[50:05] encouragement especially to the time
[50:08] that we we are living in so uh uh uh and
[50:12] they have to pray meditating and then
[50:14] things started to kind of for opening up
[50:16] to me on that on that uh on that subject
[50:19] as well and and so I'm I'm caught
[50:24] between the Rock and the high place
[50:26] tonight amen praise the Lord so But
[50:28] whichever way we will ask the Holy
[50:31] Spirit to have his way praise the Lord
[50:33] amen whichever way we will have the Holy
[50:36] Spirit ask the holy spirit will have his
[50:37] way for the few meanings that is left
[50:40] before Us Praise the Lord but what I was
[50:42] thinking about on that thought of uh of
[50:46] of the unclean Spirit if I if I'm not
[50:48] able to do that tonight I will I will be
[50:51] able to pick that up on uh on
[50:55] on Sunday and but it would be it would
[50:58] be very good to to recap a little bit on
[51:02] uh
[51:04] a man running away from the presence of
[51:06] the Lord now you have to realize that
[51:09] the the
[51:11] inspiration behind that message
[51:14] was responsibility
[51:18] that was the inspiration
[51:21] praise the Lord
[51:23] think about
[51:24] all of the people all doing brother
[51:26] Brandon Ministry that was asking him
[51:28] questions about marriage in divorce
[51:31] you know so the responsibility was on
[51:34] was on this prophet
[51:36] to bring them the word
[51:40] knowing that he had good friends people
[51:43] that love him that were married divorced
[51:46] and and all of that so so the emphasis
[51:49] the the breaking ground
[51:52] of the marriage and the Vault series was
[51:54] responsibility
[51:57] I better bam closed the tip and he says
[52:00] uh uh uh uh uh if you if you disagree
[52:04] with me he says and you don't you don't
[52:06] regard what I say he says but remember
[52:09] that I have a responsibility
[52:14] praise the Lord he says I have a
[52:17] responsibility if you will own it
[52:18] respect the fact that I have a
[52:21] responsibility so that's that is that is
[52:23] the emphasis that's what the Holy Ghost
[52:25] was driving on honor that debt and uh uh
[52:30] you know we could talk about different
[52:31] things but the the important thing there
[52:34] is that we have to realize
[52:37] that life itself is a responsibility
[52:40] right
[52:42] praise the Lord
[52:44] life is a responsibility
[52:48] Christian Life is a responsibility
[52:52] we have been trusted
[52:55] with the Zoe God's own life
[52:58] he had trust us with his life
[53:01] we are in the we are in the condition
[53:02] just like Joseph was trusted to watch
[53:06] over Mary
[53:09] why she carried the Christ child in her
[53:12] womb
[53:13] there were many men on the Earth
[53:17] but God trusted Joseph
[53:20] and the Bible said he was a just man
[53:24] praise the Lord
[53:26] musicians I think have started like this
[53:28] so praise the Lord amen I thought we
[53:32] were going to sing again but it looks
[53:33] like I'm already in it
[53:36] so the Lord bless you and uh so so
[53:39] that's that's that's what that's what I
[53:41] want us to realize you know and there
[53:43] are a few things that brother Branham
[53:45] said there about responsibility
[53:49] amen about responsibility if you just
[53:52] think about it Christian Life is a life
[53:56] of responsibility
[53:58] we are responsible
[54:00] praise the Lord
[54:02] amen every one of us that come to this
[54:05] local assembly we are responsible for
[54:08] everything the happy in this building
[54:11] and around this building
[54:16] everything anything everything
[54:18] everything that happened around this
[54:20] property
[54:21] praise the Lord I remember the first
[54:24] time I I I
[54:26] started coming to church here
[54:29] and I came few service I would say sit
[54:32] some some wedding back or I would say
[54:34] somewhere there at that time we had we
[54:36] just had only two you know we had an eye
[54:39] yet and you know two separate roles
[54:41] and uh uh and and quickly that I knew
[54:45] that uh uh we you know there was there
[54:48] was there was nobody staying in the in
[54:50] the foyer there when uh whenever we had
[54:53] a service going on you know at the time
[54:55] we were playing having uh video Services
[54:57] tip services and uh and every time I
[55:00] hear the door sign I would step out now
[55:03] we had a little monitor in The Sound
[55:04] Room and we had a uh a camera out there
[55:09] so that was directly connected to the
[55:11] monitor so every time a person comes
[55:14] through the door uh uh Albert Jones will
[55:17] see them but I did not know
[55:21] praise the Lord amen every time uh uh
[55:25] you know or someone as soon as I hear
[55:27] the door I would just step out
[55:30] so uh uh bless his heart brother John
[55:33] one day after service yeah he he met me
[55:37] outside he says
[55:39] he say Hey Brother
[55:40] uh it looks like you are a chef
[55:43] nominated deacon
[55:47] laughs
[55:50] I said I told him I said I said well you
[55:54] know for the fact that uh you know my my
[55:57] family do come here
[55:59] and there is nobody out there I don't
[56:03] mind being a chef nominated deacon
[56:08] praise the Lord
[56:13] amen
[56:15] but I said there to say it's uh uh it's
[56:18] a responsibility on our shoulder let us
[56:20] not come to church and just for our
[56:22] hands you know and I mean just come
[56:25] which of course we we believe we have
[56:27] passed that you know just to come in and
[56:31] perform our religious Duty
[56:34] you know wow our religious duty is more
[56:39] than the singing the preaching and
[56:41] receiving the word the Bible says we
[56:44] must provoke one another you know uh uh
[56:47] to uh to Godliness and righteousness and
[56:51] uh and so that in one sense gave us uh
[56:56] the responsibility that we have to one
[56:58] another Amen to encourage one another
[57:02] and uh
[57:04] you know encourage one another
[57:08] so uh that's that's what I wanted for us
[57:11] to kind of recap a little bit we might
[57:14] we might shoot back to the message and
[57:16] pick up some few things there but before
[57:19] I do that let me let me just run uh
[57:23] let me just run over something quickly
[57:25] here I might come back to that
[57:28] uh I might come back to that
[57:35] she's a cartoon I realized I didn't send
[57:37] anything back yet I just have only one
[57:39] coat I ship it back there to you now and
[57:42] that's what I will read tonight is from
[57:45] the message the house
[57:47] and uh
[57:51] I would pick on that
[57:54] a little bit tonight
[57:58] cheers to just to kind of give you an
[58:00] idea when we uh maybe Sunday if the Lord
[58:03] will you know we keep the channel open
[58:06] and and think that we should we should
[58:09] continue in that line we will continue
[58:12] and uh also I wanted to uh
[58:17] I wanted to uh remind us or announce
[58:21] that the last Sunday
[58:25] of the month we will have a convenience
[58:27] service
[58:29] for some reason this year uh most uh we
[58:34] have few weddings on the first weekend
[58:36] of the of the month and and coupled of
[58:40] those weddings have been having me to to
[58:43] be away there's a family that used to be
[58:45] with us there in the Ivory Coast uh
[58:49] you know uh very uh wonderful family
[58:53] they were very encouraging supportive
[58:56] you know when you as a as a Young Man
[59:01] you know you have people there of great
[59:05] starters and uh not so much of great
[59:08] status in a way that the world will look
[59:11] at it but you find you know responsible
[59:13] people and admire people in in you know
[59:16] and and the kind of trust and respect
[59:19] you know uh the grace of God upon your
[59:22] life it humbles you you know sometimes
[59:25] we kind of forget it in our head and we
[59:27] think that it make us something else but
[59:29] that humble us so this family was very
[59:31] very uh encouraging to us it was a
[59:34] blessing to me to see people of of their
[59:37] age and and you know and what they you
[59:40] know they were doing in this life and
[59:42] you know to to have take to us so one of
[59:46] the girls will be getting married on the
[59:47] first weekend in October and the parents
[59:51] are hoping to make it you know but then
[59:54] uh you know uh the the choose to talk to
[59:57] me just to prepare myself to to get down
[1:00:01] there if they if they are not able to
[1:00:03] get their visa on time
[1:00:05] so uh
[1:00:08] we will we will remind ourselves again
[1:00:11] maybe the last weekend there in in
[1:00:13] September we will uh
[1:00:16] we have a community service permitting
[1:00:19] there Sunday evening they have a
[1:00:20] community service this long weekend also
[1:00:23] we were away for the wedding there in
[1:00:25] Chicago and uh it's a dear sister
[1:00:30] traveling from Nigeria to John her
[1:00:33] Houseman year the uh the pastor got in
[1:00:36] touch with us and wanted to make sure
[1:00:38] that we get her to a place where she can
[1:00:40] be able to go to church and all of that
[1:00:43] so her daughter was getting married and
[1:00:45] she asked that we come in and support
[1:00:47] them in the past I also wanted for us to
[1:00:50] preach they have a very small group
[1:00:51] there that he he runs from his house but
[1:00:55] this time since there were a lot of
[1:00:56] people in town he rented a church so we
[1:01:00] can have a service there so that was
[1:01:02] also a blessing we thank the Lord for
[1:01:05] that amen so uh but let's let's get
[1:01:09] today I was just trying to uh
[1:01:12] uh distract you a little bit yeah why I
[1:01:15] wait for uh our sisters to be able to
[1:01:19] get get this code let's just read this
[1:01:21] it's from the message the house uh
[1:01:23] rather than that
[1:01:26] uh
[1:01:27] work on it the way that I I want to
[1:01:31] present it but we will just read it
[1:01:34] then he was Burbank was asking the
[1:01:37] brother to read the next question
[1:01:38] concerning the three unclean Spirit now
[1:01:41] this is in 1961. he says that come out
[1:01:45] of Revelation come out of the mouth of
[1:01:48] the Fall Spirit and the dragon and so
[1:01:51] forth now we are going to get that in
[1:01:56] our study now that's that's what I
[1:01:58] wanted for us to study on because I
[1:02:00] believe that it was a beautiful thing
[1:02:02] you know that the way the Holy Spirit
[1:02:04] kind of for there with us last Wednesday
[1:02:07] you know when and uh and we we read
[1:02:10] Revelation 1 John falling down at the
[1:02:15] feet of the Lord Jesus and you know in
[1:02:17] the end of the spirit you know the Holy
[1:02:19] Spirit have one of our sister falling
[1:02:21] down at the feet of the Lord Jesus now
[1:02:24] so you see uh the the thing about that
[1:02:26] also that caught my mind is that um we
[1:02:29] have uh we have had all sorts of wrong
[1:02:34] messages that goes with that you know
[1:02:37] and and I think uh the Lord wants to
[1:02:41] bring us to such a place of Liberty you
[1:02:44] know sometimes we we struggle we hold
[1:02:47] ourselves you know uh uh and then uh
[1:02:51] because we don't want to be
[1:02:52] misunderstood we don't want to thank
[1:02:54] their people you know we think that
[1:02:56] maybe we get a sin in our life that's
[1:02:58] why we are crying or uh you know
[1:03:00] something going wrong with us that's the
[1:03:03] reason why we are yelling all over the
[1:03:04] building you know it can go both ways
[1:03:08] it can go both ways but when the people
[1:03:11] of God are ready to to uh you know enjoy
[1:03:15] the liberty of the spirit amen if the
[1:03:18] spirit is dealing with your heart you
[1:03:20] want to stream and say thank you Jesus
[1:03:22] scream and say thank you Jesus praise
[1:03:24] the Lord those things bring healing you
[1:03:27] know because they are not normal
[1:03:30] it is not a pre-plained thing
[1:03:33] praise the Lord if you try to
[1:03:35] impersonate it God will embarrass you
[1:03:37] because God do not like impersonation
[1:03:42] praise the Lord
[1:03:45] but I mean
[1:03:47] I think that God want to bring us to
[1:03:49] that place and break us from our fears
[1:03:51] you know uh uh and break us uh uh you
[1:03:56] know uh and and and and and because
[1:03:58] those things does not happen sometimes
[1:04:00] you know uh uh the the kind of for
[1:04:03] troubled our children they think what
[1:04:05] what is that you know what was that you
[1:04:07] know and uh and it must not be a good
[1:04:10] attitude for children to sit in church
[1:04:12] and live when someone gets under the
[1:04:14] spirit you you might get yourself in
[1:04:16] trouble
[1:04:19] praise the Lord
[1:04:21] you know so uh
[1:04:24] I know the church were today have abused
[1:04:27] those things
[1:04:28] you know
[1:04:30] and because of the abuse that is out
[1:04:34] there now the people that you enjoy that
[1:04:37] Liberty of the spirit are now refraining
[1:04:40] themselves and and holding to the
[1:04:42] seating you know uh so much but and and
[1:04:46] that's the reason why I started to think
[1:04:49] about the importance on teaching uh on
[1:04:53] clean spirit
[1:04:54] you'll realize in the scripture
[1:04:57] that
[1:04:59] unclean Spirit were never healed
[1:05:04] the person was healed but unclean Spirit
[1:05:07] was always cast out
[1:05:11] in Old Testament the same thing with
[1:05:15] leprosy
[1:05:16] there is nowhere that leprosy was healed
[1:05:19] leprosy where it cleanse
[1:05:24] praise the Lord now so if you if you get
[1:05:27] into that and start to and start to
[1:05:30] study that you will realize that there
[1:05:32] is a reason why
[1:05:36] the reason there is because
[1:05:40] that nature of the unclean spirit
[1:05:45] was breached into
[1:05:48] uh the the human nature
[1:05:51] through the fall
[1:05:56] praise the Lord
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:00] through the fall
[1:06:02] and uh and and it it kind of for me
[1:06:07] uh uh uh a two-tail of our being
[1:06:16] it's made of two-thirds of our being
[1:06:18] David said in sin that my mother
[1:06:19] conceived me coming to the word speaking
[1:06:21] lies so you see uh uh and and that's
[1:06:25] what sometimes people struggle
[1:06:28] you know uh because there are some
[1:06:31] things that runs down in our family
[1:06:36] and as and as a child of God a Son of
[1:06:39] God a daughter of God the Holy Ghost
[1:06:41] want to bring you to a realization
[1:06:45] for you to realize that you are a child
[1:06:49] of God born of The Incorruptible seed
[1:06:52] which is the word of God
[1:06:57] and then every other thing
[1:07:00] what are you know if your father used to
[1:07:02] do it your grandfather used to do it you
[1:07:05] need to cast it out
[1:07:08] now so it's it's at a place where the
[1:07:12] Holy Ghost bring us to that realization
[1:07:14] to protect this territory
[1:07:18] because the thing about it that is that
[1:07:20] when you cast it out it will come back
[1:07:22] again
[1:07:25] praise the Lord and what happens to
[1:07:28] people uh uh uh uh during the ages is
[1:07:31] there the you know they go to a Revival
[1:07:33] all the prayer then the Lord give them a
[1:07:35] breakthrough and they feed free from a
[1:07:37] certain Spirit and the just thing is all
[1:07:40] to it
[1:07:43] praise the Lord
[1:07:46] and then and then sometimes they are now
[1:07:48] watching they are now being careful what
[1:07:51] the moment you get into the environment
[1:07:53] the atmosphere is is all around it
[1:07:57] Jesus said is seeking to come back to
[1:08:00] make you worse
[1:08:01] than you was before
[1:08:06] then pretty soon you start to experience
[1:08:08] that then what is doing there is is
[1:08:11] trying to discredit the work of God in
[1:08:14] your life
[1:08:18] say you were just excited there was
[1:08:19] nothing to that see see you read back in
[1:08:22] the same old thing
[1:08:25] sure
[1:08:28] praise the Lord so from the womb to the
[1:08:32] Grave
[1:08:35] all to the rapture
[1:08:39] from the womb to the Grave or to the
[1:08:42] body change
[1:08:44] until we leave this body and step into
[1:08:48] our new body
[1:08:50] it's a constant fight
[1:08:55] that's what better brand preached the
[1:08:57] message the greater battle ever fought
[1:08:59] is a constant fight
[1:09:02] that's the reason why a Christian is
[1:09:04] somebody that is very conscious of their
[1:09:07] life the conscious of their environment
[1:09:09] their conscious of everything that is
[1:09:11] happening around them
[1:09:13] that's what make a Christian Life a life
[1:09:16] of responsibility
[1:09:25] you see why this this is important for
[1:09:28] us to study it
[1:09:30] you know
[1:09:31] and then Lord the Lord started dealing
[1:09:33] with my heart on this this morning I
[1:09:35] said I was saying wow you know I've you
[1:09:37] know I thought about it I knew some of
[1:09:41] the things but it never came to mind to
[1:09:43] me like the way they came to me you know
[1:09:46] so right from Genesis 3
[1:09:53] right from Genesis 3.
[1:09:58] and makes took place
[1:10:06] the Lord
[1:10:10] now so uh we will read we read yet a
[1:10:13] little bit and
[1:10:15] we are going to get get there in our
[1:10:18] study now the three unclean spirit
[1:10:22] is the three is in
[1:10:30] praise the Lord now he's saying the
[1:10:33] three unclean spirit is the three ism
[1:10:40] but after the seals
[1:10:43] he make us to know that the you know the
[1:10:45] the that on that unclean spirit
[1:10:49] is the trinitarian doctrine
[1:10:52] now
[1:10:54] the reason there is there
[1:10:57] you we will understand that because
[1:11:00] because all of those Mysteries were
[1:11:03] hidden in the seals
[1:11:07] amen we have to know there are three
[1:11:12] major powers
[1:11:17] praise the Lord three major evil powers
[1:11:22] that control the word
[1:11:27] is a political power
[1:11:30] a religious power
[1:11:34] and demonic
[1:11:36] that is that is Satan forces that is
[1:11:41] says uh uh that's that's the that's the
[1:11:45] Dynamics of the enemy
[1:11:49] so yeah brother Brandon is showing the
[1:11:52] three don't clean spirits
[1:11:55] as agents
[1:11:58] which is under the political power
[1:12:03] because every government on the Earth
[1:12:09] is Birth by one of these isms
[1:12:14] praise the Lord
[1:12:17] amen you will see the beauty of Faith as
[1:12:19] we go down uh I don't know if I'm uh you
[1:12:23] know I'm kind of staring the water here
[1:12:26] I should have just gone into my
[1:12:30] he says here uh the three-year unclean
[1:12:33] spirit is the three reasons let me type
[1:12:36] it for you now and you will see where
[1:12:40] it started where it begins see there was
[1:12:44] communism uh Fascism and Nazism
[1:12:49] they were Spirits communism is a spirit
[1:12:52] it gets on you
[1:12:58] praise the Lord
[1:13:00] right it gets on you
[1:13:06] it's a spirit
[1:13:08] it is something like that
[1:13:11] that really isn't it
[1:13:13] but it will be three Spirit just like
[1:13:18] that
[1:13:19] which
[1:13:20] there was kind of a forerunner now what
[1:13:25] is he saying now those three ISM was a
[1:13:29] forerunner
[1:13:30] it went ahead
[1:13:34] but there was a religious play behind it
[1:13:38] it was for running something
[1:13:53] of course you know
[1:13:56] is in catalism
[1:14:01] I want to get
[1:14:02] get a few things on their street before
[1:14:06] I say it
[1:14:07] to be sure that uh
[1:14:12] uh that I know what but is the three
[1:14:16] this is a three spirit
[1:14:19] just like communism just talking about
[1:14:21] the three isms
[1:14:24] remember I told you I said it it will be
[1:14:29] it will be a thing that will that would
[1:14:33] take place
[1:14:34] all wind up in communism the three will
[1:14:38] all wind up in communism
[1:14:41] and that's and that's where it's done
[1:14:45] that's the same thing it will be it will
[1:14:48] be at that time
[1:14:50] it will be three unclean spirits that we
[1:14:54] go forth
[1:14:57] I really truly believe right now just
[1:15:01] to kind of uh outline it if you don't
[1:15:05] mind
[1:15:06] if I add a little more to it when I get
[1:15:10] to explain it well you didn't explain it
[1:15:13] all together down there that's right
[1:15:17] now he's talking about in the in the
[1:15:19] future that when he gets down to explain
[1:15:21] this here's what I think I believe it's
[1:15:25] a spirit the the Sleepy version the
[1:15:28] confederation of churches Judaism on the
[1:15:32] rejecting of Christ
[1:15:34] did you think about it those people
[1:15:36] waiting for their Messiah
[1:15:41] praise the Lord
[1:15:43] that they could outrightly reject him
[1:15:51] now it was not the radical Jews that
[1:15:54] crucified Jesus it was the religious
[1:15:57] Jews
[1:16:00] what will make them do that
[1:16:03] thinking the very psalm
[1:16:06] in the temple
[1:16:10] why couldn't they see when he said my
[1:16:12] God my God why have they are forsaken me
[1:16:14] why couldn't they see it right it's a
[1:16:17] spirit
[1:16:21] it's a spirit
[1:16:28] young people that's why we don't want
[1:16:30] nothing less than the Holy Ghost we
[1:16:33] don't want a religious spirit don't just
[1:16:35] get excited
[1:16:38] you need a birth
[1:16:40] you need an experience with God your
[1:16:43] excitement won't carry you anywhere far
[1:16:52] praise the Lord
[1:16:54] see he mentioned even the foolish virgin
[1:16:57] what happened they are living clean life
[1:17:03] amen clean decent Christian life but
[1:17:07] they cannot see the revealed word for
[1:17:10] their hour
[1:17:11] they can't see it
[1:17:16] it's now your smartness that open your
[1:17:18] eyes to this message it's the mercy of
[1:17:21] God
[1:17:22] God being rich in Merced to you
[1:17:30] you think you have all the time on your
[1:17:33] hands
[1:17:37] to be running God around the house like
[1:17:39] a little child
[1:17:43] these people were preparing for their
[1:17:45] Messiah
[1:17:53] so that's that's what he's trying to say
[1:17:55] the confederation of churches they will
[1:17:57] have to take a spirit to come upon these
[1:17:59] people
[1:18:00] right
[1:18:03] they are not doing it against God they
[1:18:05] are doing it in the name of God
[1:18:15] praise the Lord
[1:18:25] when a person can take a scripture
[1:18:29] they can take a scripture to take a
[1:18:31] court
[1:18:34] sincerely
[1:18:39] they are they are anointed
[1:18:42] they can use that
[1:18:46] to break up
[1:18:48] families
[1:18:52] break up
[1:18:57] praise the Lord
[1:18:58] is strong
[1:19:10] and it's all
[1:19:12] on clean spirit
[1:19:16] God look at it as unclean spirit
[1:19:22] praise the Lord
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:26] the devil will make us to struggle with
[1:19:29] evil thought and lost and and filthiness
[1:19:32] in our flesh and all of that and he he
[1:19:35] will he will he will he will narrow that
[1:19:37] down all of those things are unclean
[1:19:39] Spirit anything that is now glorifying
[1:19:41] God is an unclean spirit
[1:19:45] but you see the most deceiving one
[1:19:51] is when he can hook you up in a
[1:19:55] religious spirit
[1:19:57] that you can go seven days fast
[1:20:01] 21 days and keep yourself before God
[1:20:07] praise the Lord
[1:20:12] and you are seeking the face of God in
[1:20:14] your mind you are seeking the face of
[1:20:16] God you are getting close to God
[1:20:18] sure
[1:20:21] and you are just sincerely worshiping
[1:20:23] the devil
[1:20:27] opening yourself up to more deception
[1:20:30] you come from out of there you just saw
[1:20:32] why and radical
[1:20:34] now I've seen God God revealed himself
[1:20:36] to me I can I don't want anybody to talk
[1:20:38] to me
[1:20:41] why because you're coming from before
[1:20:42] the burning bush
[1:20:45] you're coming from the same ground where
[1:20:47] Moses was on
[1:20:54] we have met God
[1:20:56] goodness
[1:21:01] may God help us
[1:21:06] brother Branham says just like the
[1:21:08] Indians you take one step you wash ten
[1:21:11] times
[1:21:13] and make sure that everything is a
[1:21:15] calling to the word of God
[1:21:27] praise the Lord that will not even be
[1:21:28] time for us to get to running away from
[1:21:31] the presence of the Lord
[1:21:34] but yeah the holy the Holy Ghost kind of
[1:21:36] for interrupting me with this with this
[1:21:39] thought this morning
[1:21:42] and uh it's very interesting
[1:21:45] praise the Lord
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:51] it's not just you know a baptized in
[1:21:53] Jesus name I received brother Branham as
[1:21:56] a prophet
[1:21:57] you know
[1:21:59] I tell you the devil believed that man
[1:22:01] was a prophet
[1:22:05] Satan knows that William Branham was the
[1:22:08] prophet of God for this age
[1:22:11] no matter what the critics say the devil
[1:22:13] knows better
[1:22:16] praise the Lord
[1:22:21] I believe it's a spirit
[1:22:23] he says the sleeping virgin the
[1:22:25] confederation of churches which is the
[1:22:27] World Council of churches they will all
[1:22:29] be driven together by that spirit
[1:22:34] what will unite them
[1:22:36] that they will forget about their
[1:22:39] doctrines
[1:22:41] praise the Lord
[1:22:43] amen they will forget about their
[1:22:45] doctrines the Buddhists the Melody I
[1:22:47] mean Muslims and every one of them
[1:22:50] all because we are worshiping the same
[1:22:52] God and they will just be so happy
[1:22:54] that we are now United what will bring
[1:22:57] them to death
[1:22:58] what will blind them so much
[1:23:01] that they would not be able
[1:23:07] it's an influence from those unclean
[1:23:10] spirit
[1:23:15] praise the Lord
[1:23:19] The Same Spirit that gets on people
[1:23:22] they will be blowing drugs through their
[1:23:24] body the no is destroying them
[1:23:31] but they don't have the power
[1:23:34] to set himself freely and when these
[1:23:38] unclean Spirit comes on you you don't
[1:23:40] have the power to set yourself free
[1:23:49] people can argue through right in the
[1:23:52] face of God's word
[1:23:56] praise the Lord
[1:23:59] Moses getting down there to Egypt
[1:24:02] he gets down there and he display the
[1:24:04] word of God the power of God he speaks
[1:24:07] those things into existence
[1:24:12] in the fourth plague he says uh uh uh uh
[1:24:16] magician comes to him and tell him and
[1:24:18] said Pharaoh this is the hand of God
[1:24:22] this is the finger
[1:24:27] praise the Lord
[1:24:28] the Bible says Moses warned that the
[1:24:31] akatos will die
[1:24:35] go back and read Genesis I mean Exodus
[1:24:38] the Bible says there were some of the
[1:24:40] Egyptians that believed what Moses said
[1:24:42] and they took their capitals for
[1:24:44] safekeeping
[1:24:47] the ones that did not believe the akatos
[1:24:49] died
[1:24:52] praise the Lord
[1:24:54] but after he sees that
[1:24:56] the Bible says yet his heart was hiding
[1:25:01] what was had in his heart
[1:25:05] it was a spirit
[1:25:10] praise the Lord
[1:25:18] Mikhail the prophet
[1:25:20] said unto Ahab by the vision
[1:25:26] there was a spirit that raised up before
[1:25:27] the Lord
[1:25:29] he said let me go and deceive those
[1:25:31] Prophets
[1:25:32] 400 Prophets
[1:25:35] received by a live spirit
[1:25:38] and lying spirit is an unclean spirit
[1:25:43] that was the first spirit that
[1:25:45] manifested itself in eating it was a
[1:25:47] spirit of life
[1:25:52] they see all of those 400 men
[1:25:57] that they could even slap the prophet in
[1:25:59] his face
[1:26:01] shut up we have the word of God
[1:26:16] praise the Lord
[1:26:20] you see that's the reason why people we
[1:26:22] need the watching of the water
[1:26:25] by the word
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:28] we need this war this word to wash us
[1:26:31] daily
[1:26:33] we need to be in the word and believe in
[1:26:36] the promise of God identifying our
[1:26:38] thoughts and our weaknesses and claiming
[1:26:41] God's promises that's how you take bath
[1:26:44] in the word
[1:26:46] you have to identify your thoughts and
[1:26:48] your weaknesses and then you find a
[1:26:51] promise and wash yourself with it
[1:26:54] praise the Lord
[1:26:55] amen
[1:26:59] amen
[1:27:03] don't just go and jump under the shower
[1:27:05] and be excited you know
[1:27:07] get some scrub
[1:27:09] [Laughter]
[1:27:11] and watch yourself and say God get this
[1:27:13] out of my life
[1:27:15] this thing will destroy me get it out of
[1:27:17] my life God
[1:27:26] so yeah brother Bennett is identifying
[1:27:28] that all of these things the foolish
[1:27:30] virgin the the sleeping virgin he said
[1:27:33] the confederation of churches Judaism on
[1:27:37] the rejection of Christ
[1:27:39] the Jews that rejected it
[1:27:43] and catalism
[1:27:48] that claim
[1:27:50] The Universal Church
[1:27:54] because you see where it comes out
[1:27:58] it comes out of it comes out of the
[1:28:01] false prophet out of the mouth of the
[1:28:04] false prophets which were properly
[1:28:09] from out of the Beast see and all that
[1:28:14] all that were it comes out of you can
[1:28:17] see the the background where it is
[1:28:21] and that
[1:28:23] and that's the the three unclean spirit
[1:28:28] that I will set the whole word
[1:28:31] to Armageddon
[1:28:34] praise the Lord
[1:28:36] amen
[1:28:38] you don't believe that
[1:28:42] it will set the whole word
[1:28:44] you don't believe that
[1:28:48] just one lie we all put marks over our
[1:28:52] faces
[1:28:53] the whole word
[1:28:56] we just thought that uh you know uh I
[1:28:59] mean we couldn't even find papers in the
[1:29:01] in the in the store to buy
[1:29:10] praise the Lord
[1:29:16] I'm not saying that coronavirus was
[1:29:18] alive I'm saying the way it was dead
[1:29:20] with
[1:29:25] are we together
[1:29:28] see this and that's them three unclaimed
[1:29:32] spirits
[1:29:33] so you see it I pray that the Lord help
[1:29:35] us who will be able to study that and
[1:29:37] you can run that down to uh a Genesis
[1:29:42] through the scripture to just be able to
[1:29:43] look at that and just see how you know
[1:29:47] it will encourage us to be able
[1:29:51] to rely on the promise
[1:29:54] on the Promises of God Amen
[1:29:57] to be able when Jesus says man shall not
[1:30:00] live by bread alone but by every word of
[1:30:02] God I mean you're not just reading the
[1:30:04] word because uh you know is is your duty
[1:30:07] to read it but you are you are you are
[1:30:09] looking for the promises you are
[1:30:11] applying those promises
[1:30:13] you can re-exit and take some of those
[1:30:15] promises Lord the same way you got it
[1:30:17] your children you are with us
[1:30:22] you can take those promises daily
[1:30:28] because it's out there this is all
[1:30:30] around us
[1:30:43] so we move out there from uh from the
[1:30:45] political realm over to the to the
[1:30:48] religious stream which is the church and
[1:30:50] down is in uh uh a kind of a demonic
[1:30:54] reign
[1:30:55] and uh and then we see that you can take
[1:30:59] that we'll look at that also Revelation
[1:31:01] chapter six you look at you know the uh
[1:31:04] uh the White House rather uh the red
[1:31:07] horse rather the black house rather you
[1:31:10] know all of those things were they were
[1:31:13] all the power
[1:31:15] the power that were behind
[1:31:20] praise the Lord
[1:31:22] amen
[1:31:25] and and one of the things that the
[1:31:27] prophet said
[1:31:30] that
[1:31:33] that is that is with those on clean
[1:31:36] spirit
[1:31:37] he sees the nature of the frog is to
[1:31:39] always look to his past
[1:31:44] is to always look to his past
[1:31:48] as long as the devil can keep you in
[1:31:50] your past
[1:31:55] he can always have an influence
[1:31:58] over your life you can never guess to
[1:32:00] your Victory you can never get to the
[1:32:02] promise
[1:32:03] you can never guess to your inheritance
[1:32:08] for getting those things in the past
[1:32:11] Paul says I press unto the mark
[1:32:13] of the High Calling
[1:32:22] praise the Lord
[1:32:23] so we see here with a few minutes that
[1:32:26] is left here I think I have three
[1:32:27] minutes what what can I do with it
[1:32:30] amen I don't uh I can preach you sweat
[1:32:34] tonight
[1:32:36] amen but I've known that it was it was a
[1:32:39] prayer meeting that the thought was
[1:32:41] birth honor I wanted to bring it tonight
[1:32:43] on this prayer meeting but then I was I
[1:32:46] was very sure that uh there was there
[1:32:49] was the conclusion of uh a man running
[1:32:52] away from the presence of the Lord
[1:32:54] uh so uh I will I will Dash back to the
[1:32:57] to that message
[1:33:00] and uh and be able to pick up some few
[1:33:03] things there
[1:33:04] uh
[1:33:06] praise the Lord
[1:33:08] I kind of for
[1:33:10] um
[1:33:15] then most of my the highlights of my
[1:33:18] thoughts on my phone so uh I'll see if
[1:33:21] the Lord will be able to
[1:33:24] to uh
[1:33:29] help me remember some of that now you
[1:33:32] see so uh brother Branham uh just like I
[1:33:35] said
[1:33:36] this was the beginning of the series to
[1:33:39] the ma to to marriage and Davos which of
[1:33:42] which of course there was also one of
[1:33:45] the mystery that was held under the seal
[1:33:47] the the right you know uh the truth
[1:33:51] about marriage and divorce the truth
[1:33:54] about marriage and divorce was a mystery
[1:33:56] that will heal under the seals because
[1:33:58] when uh when Adam fell uh he left the
[1:34:04] first Covenant
[1:34:05] that he was honored
[1:34:08] amen and a second Covenant was
[1:34:11] introduced
[1:34:13] so with the second with the second
[1:34:16] Covenant being introduced there is no
[1:34:19] way he could have that those are some of
[1:34:21] the thoughts were brother Branham saying
[1:34:23] it went back to the original owner
[1:34:27] so the truth about marriage in Davos was
[1:34:30] was always held under the seals
[1:34:35] so uh uh
[1:34:38] so you see that it was it was such a
[1:34:41] a responsibility that was on that was on
[1:34:45] broadband shoulder to be able to bring
[1:34:47] bring the subject
[1:34:53] paragraph 18 He said Each night if the
[1:34:56] Lord willing I think the lord has laid
[1:35:00] upon my heart a very definite message
[1:35:02] for the church
[1:35:03] I have been several days in prayer and I
[1:35:08] won't go I won't go into that because a
[1:35:11] great phenomenon happened the other day
[1:35:13] that was that lie that was over the
[1:35:16] mountain when those boys were at a gas
[1:35:18] station and someone said Brandon is up
[1:35:20] there amen there's all of those things
[1:35:22] that he was talking about
[1:35:31] and I'm anxious to tell you about it now
[1:35:34] the main subject uh uh
[1:35:38] he says
[1:35:41] which most of them barely said I've been
[1:35:44] calling was on marriage and divorce
[1:35:47] praise the Lord
[1:35:49] now you see because you you you you you
[1:35:52] see the the the the strictness of the
[1:35:57] word you see you know how much this
[1:36:00] ministry has brought us to a life of
[1:36:04] sincerity you know how much it has
[1:36:07] required sincerity and brought a brand
[1:36:09] name you know what I mean with with the
[1:36:12] with the grace of God and the gift of
[1:36:14] God in this life you know uh I mean it
[1:36:17] had to it had to be God to bring a man
[1:36:20] to that place praise the Lord so all of
[1:36:23] all of these people that were around
[1:36:25] brother Branham you know all of these
[1:36:26] people that had these different
[1:36:28] situations you can you can just imagine
[1:36:31] you know what are some of the things
[1:36:33] that they were you know that they were
[1:36:35] that they were going through you know
[1:36:37] why is this is this thing going to seem
[1:36:39] into hell because I have done this you
[1:36:41] know all of the questions that were
[1:36:43] going through their mind you know so uh
[1:36:49] you know Broadband has to talk how to
[1:36:51] kind of kind of for deal with this now
[1:36:54] so uh I just like I said the the
[1:36:57] emphasis here is on responsibility
[1:37:01] so
[1:37:02] I hope that uh
[1:37:07] uh we can be able to look at it that way
[1:37:10] and and and be able to
[1:37:13] to realize the other uh
[1:37:18] what what the Holy Spirit was trying to
[1:37:23] to bring to us
[1:37:27] out of this word
[1:37:32] okay I'm I'm just trying to drop I
[1:37:35] realize I've gone through most of my
[1:37:37] time here
[1:37:39] so
[1:37:59] okay
[1:38:02] in paragraph 48 that's where he really
[1:38:04] start kind of for introducing his his
[1:38:07] thought his inspiration we got so many
[1:38:10] things we have to do so much
[1:38:12] responsibility that we have to face
[1:38:18] everybody has got to face a certain
[1:38:21] responsibility
[1:38:23] so life
[1:38:25] is a responsibility
[1:38:28] we want the best of the service it is
[1:38:30] our responsibility
[1:38:32] praise the Lord
[1:38:34] you can't blame the musicians you can't
[1:38:36] blame the song leader
[1:38:38] you are also responsible for everything
[1:38:41] when you come through those doors
[1:38:43] and coming to the into into the into
[1:38:46] this place of worship you are
[1:38:48] responsible
[1:38:52] praise the Lord
[1:38:57] it's a responsibility that is on our
[1:38:59] hands
[1:39:00] and Brother Band would go and talk also
[1:39:02] he will he will bring it in the light of
[1:39:04] this which of course is he's kind of for
[1:39:07] creating the thought here he says when
[1:39:10] you come to choose a wife get married or
[1:39:14] choose a husband you have got to take a
[1:39:17] responsibility
[1:39:20] and then you must maybe uh you build a
[1:39:24] home a nice prayer to home and then
[1:39:26] remember as a married woman you got to
[1:39:30] think of the responsibility of raising
[1:39:32] children
[1:39:34] and you got to think of them pretty
[1:39:38] slick hands is going to have little
[1:39:42] dirty handprints all over the world
[1:39:45] then you got the responsibility of
[1:39:49] educating your children you got the
[1:39:51] responsibility of closing and feeling
[1:39:53] everything is a responsibility
[1:39:57] and it's so easy when the responsibility
[1:40:00] face us
[1:40:03] amen to shrink from them
[1:40:08] praise the Lord
[1:40:10] amen
[1:40:11] and when we just when we just look at
[1:40:13] life and uh uh I mean even even all of
[1:40:17] you going to college it's a
[1:40:18] responsibility
[1:40:20] to be able to choose a career
[1:40:23] you cannot just say well this other
[1:40:25] person is doing this I think that I
[1:40:27] think this other person is doing they
[1:40:29] know
[1:40:35] he says when the responsibility face us
[1:40:39] we we uh we shrink from them
[1:40:45] many times this is
[1:40:48] this is high to say but is the truth
[1:40:51] that ministers many times string from
[1:40:54] responsibility to for standing for the
[1:40:57] word of God
[1:41:00] standing for the truth word of God when
[1:41:03] they are confronted with it
[1:41:07] the strength from it
[1:41:09] praise the Lord
[1:41:11] I mean the the ministry is not just uh
[1:41:14] you know coming in and and having an
[1:41:16] audience with people or the you know
[1:41:19] being a good speaker
[1:41:21] it's a responsibility
[1:41:25] I mean sometimes you have to you you
[1:41:27] just you have to stand on that word
[1:41:29] until God can be able to give you a
[1:41:33] better understanding you have to stay
[1:41:34] with what truth is before you right and
[1:41:37] it don't make you popular
[1:41:39] either
[1:41:44] praise the Lord
[1:41:47] it'll make you popular
[1:41:56] so he's I mean bringing this thing here
[1:41:58] and making us to realize you know uh uh
[1:42:01] you know all of you young people as you
[1:42:04] are growing you know uh you you have to
[1:42:07] uh this this is this is a scripture that
[1:42:10] I I was uh looking at in the Book of
[1:42:12] Solomon uh uh in the Book of Proverbs
[1:42:15] sorry that Solomon said and I will I'll
[1:42:18] try to uh try to get diverse there for
[1:42:20] you you know uh uh Solomon is he said in
[1:42:25] in a in a proverb he says uh uh make
[1:42:29] your band
[1:42:30] which means the storage of your house
[1:42:34] he says before you build your house
[1:42:41] okay
[1:42:42] you have to build the band where you
[1:42:44] will keep all your food before you start
[1:42:47] building your house
[1:42:52] so that goes to say is you have to
[1:42:54] prepare yourself as a young man and as a
[1:42:57] young woman
[1:42:58] you have to prepare yourself spiritually
[1:43:02] amen the thing of where young people get
[1:43:06] to the places and it and it's not going
[1:43:08] crazy and they say they are worried they
[1:43:10] are depressed I'm not married I mean you
[1:43:12] are just you are just you just you are
[1:43:13] just killing yourself you're being lazy
[1:43:17] you are running from your present
[1:43:19] responsibility and you want a future
[1:43:21] responsibility when you are not there
[1:43:22] yet
[1:43:27] praise the Lord
[1:43:31] it is just the devil flipping the queen
[1:43:33] around and getting you confused there
[1:43:36] are things that you are responsible for
[1:43:37] right now
[1:43:40] is to pay attention to your schooling
[1:43:42] and get yourself a degree if you are a
[1:43:45] man you have to take care of your family
[1:43:51] so you want to you want to uh trust the
[1:43:54] Lord and you know be a Son of God and
[1:43:57] and think on what what I'm designed to
[1:43:59] do as a carrier
[1:44:04] because technically if the Lord I bless
[1:44:07] your hands to do something Kevin I mean
[1:44:09] he's surely going to give you a family
[1:44:12] right
[1:44:16] while worried about them if you don't
[1:44:18] have you don't have money to feed him
[1:44:23] praise the Lord
[1:44:27] you're not even paying your own rent
[1:44:32] then you worrying about when will I get
[1:44:34] married
[1:44:37] praise the Lord
[1:44:40] you see it's it's just it's Justified of
[1:44:43] uh bringing ourselves waking ourselves
[1:44:45] up
[1:44:48] and now to listen to The Devil's life
[1:45:02] he says everything is a responsibility
[1:45:05] now you see that's the all of those
[1:45:07] things accounted for you know uh uh all
[1:45:10] work in there you see so you see the
[1:45:12] Devil comes around with with that
[1:45:14] unclean Spirit of Lies
[1:45:19] praise the Lord
[1:45:21] what he want to do is that he just want
[1:45:24] to isolate you he want to praise you in
[1:45:27] your own mind
[1:45:29] and when you get prison in your mind
[1:45:31] your hands become weak
[1:45:33] your head is so big on your shoulder
[1:45:35] your hands become weak you can do
[1:45:37] anything you just lay down and you whine
[1:45:40] and you cry
[1:45:42] praise the Lord
[1:45:49] everything is a responsibility
[1:45:53] you know so that's that's what he was he
[1:45:55] was driving he was driving out and there
[1:45:58] was something he said go back again play
[1:45:59] the tape again and before we get to the
[1:46:02] next one you know he he he uh uh
[1:46:05] somewhere there in the in the message
[1:46:06] there he says uh uh uh this
[1:46:09] responsibility you know he talks about
[1:46:11] Luther how Luther had a responsibility
[1:46:13] Ludo was not afraid you know people were
[1:46:16] were afraid to face up with Luther truth
[1:46:19] when it comes forth of justification he
[1:46:21] talks about the Methodist you know he
[1:46:23] just talked about different men All
[1:46:25] Through the Ages it has always been
[1:46:27] there right it has always been there
[1:46:32] praise the Lord
[1:46:36] I mean even as children of God
[1:46:40] sometimes that's the reason why people
[1:46:42] misunder I mean mistake your age because
[1:46:44] even the way you dress
[1:46:51] the way you present yourself
[1:46:54] because you know you have a
[1:46:56] responsibility
[1:46:58] to represent Jesus Christ Wherever You
[1:47:01] Are
[1:47:02] that's the reason why you cannot have
[1:47:04] one life for church and another life for
[1:47:07] out there praise the Lord
[1:47:09] pretty soon you will just expose
[1:47:11] yourself
[1:47:12] you are just deceiving yourself
[1:47:22] praise the Lord
[1:47:23] we have a responsibility
[1:47:37] we all have a responsibility
[1:47:39] to carry this little group in the
[1:47:41] rapture
[1:47:43] amen
[1:47:48] if Jesus started
[1:47:50] we have your little ones Among Us
[1:47:56] children are being born children are
[1:47:57] raising up Among Us
[1:48:00] we have a responsibility you know I was
[1:48:02] thinking about that last night what I
[1:48:03] was praying and I was just thinking
[1:48:05] about this uh you know uh uh the
[1:48:07] scripture says this promise is unto you
[1:48:10] into your children
[1:48:12] it did not say it's unto you so you can
[1:48:14] give it to your children no no no no
[1:48:16] it's unto you and to your children
[1:48:21] you can pass it down to them but the
[1:48:24] promise is for them they have to be
[1:48:26] prepared to receive it just like you
[1:48:29] receive it
[1:48:34] it's not something that we can hand down
[1:48:36] no so we have a responsibility
[1:48:40] to create all the atmosphere around them
[1:48:44] for them to be attracted to the promise
[1:48:47] right yes
[1:48:51] in any way that we can support them
[1:48:59] praise the Lord
[1:49:04] believe the Lord Jesus
[1:49:07] in your household will be safe
[1:49:14] in the climax of his message he said it
[1:49:17] was the responsibility that Jonah was
[1:49:20] running away from
[1:49:21] a man running away from the presence of
[1:49:23] the Lord he was running away from the
[1:49:25] responsibility of bringing a a Jewish
[1:49:30] message to a gentile people
[1:49:35] praise the Lord
[1:49:36] the responsibility of bringing a Jewish
[1:49:39] god to a gentile hidden people
[1:49:45] everybody knew that Nineveh was a wicked
[1:49:49] City everybody knew that
[1:49:51] the wickedness and the evil that was
[1:49:53] done in that City
[1:49:56] but God needed a voice to cry out
[1:50:00] brother Branham says the responsibility
[1:50:02] of the hour is to cry out
[1:50:07] it's a crowd against the wrong crowd
[1:50:10] against sin
[1:50:15] praise the Lord
[1:50:20] we want to you know rub one another on
[1:50:22] the back be nice to one another you know
[1:50:24] and and just going out like they I know
[1:50:26] it does not work that way
[1:50:28] it does not work that way
[1:50:32] amen
[1:50:37] very powerful guy Eddie he says and the
[1:50:39] responsibility that God has given us in
[1:50:42] this day to bring this message
[1:50:45] and as I get older and I know my days is
[1:50:49] short enough I feel the responsibility
[1:50:51] greater than I've ever felt it passing
[1:50:55] on
[1:50:56] I must do it
[1:50:57] we must get down in in every word we go
[1:51:02] and tell the message and tell the people
[1:51:05] that Jesus Christ is coming
[1:51:08] that that he's God and he's coming soon
[1:51:12] there's not a hope left in this word but
[1:51:17] the coming of the Lord
[1:51:22] praise the Lord
[1:51:25] amen
[1:51:28] now you can see it it it it it happens
[1:51:31] to you
[1:51:33] if you're not like that you are the one
[1:51:35] coming to preach on Sunday all you are
[1:51:37] the one playing the music or even or
[1:51:39] even singing a special
[1:51:40] but they were just an audience said I
[1:51:43] guess on your own I gotta hurry up and
[1:51:45] get a church oh yeah getting late why
[1:51:47] you do that
[1:51:49] why you do that
[1:51:52] when you are not the one that is opening
[1:51:54] the door
[1:51:55] you are not the one that got to set
[1:51:56] people down but why do you do that
[1:52:00] it's because a spirit of responsibility
[1:52:05] is on your shoulder
[1:52:09] praise the Lord
[1:52:14] that's why you look at your time ah my
[1:52:15] goodness it's late even you are working
[1:52:18] and and and then you realize you you
[1:52:20] have to do this you know you this is
[1:52:22] your time that you have you you sign up
[1:52:24] to work till this time but you keep
[1:52:26] looking at your time
[1:52:28] yeah I want to clock out now and go why
[1:52:30] you do that
[1:52:36] is because the spirit of his stewardship
[1:52:41] God bought stewardship
[1:52:44] on you you feel it
[1:52:46] that I need to be in church
[1:52:49] I need to get to church
[1:52:58] praise the Lord
[1:53:04] and like Paul says
[1:53:06] every man
[1:53:10] that is asked to be a steward
[1:53:12] must be faithful
[1:53:15] there is one requirement of every
[1:53:18] Steward that we must be faithful to what
[1:53:21] God has placed in our hands to what he
[1:53:24] have taught us to do you see that's the
[1:53:26] reason why the things that will bring
[1:53:29] our reward
[1:53:32] not the things
[1:53:34] that we do to please people
[1:53:40] praise the Lord
[1:53:44] is because God has given you a
[1:53:46] responsibility
[1:53:47] to
[1:53:49] be a Son of God in this age
[1:53:52] to believe that you are a son of God and
[1:53:55] to live like one
[1:54:00] to be proud that you are a son of God
[1:54:05] just like
[1:54:07] if they call you and says you are the
[1:54:09] manager
[1:54:10] of this place
[1:54:14] you write a note of thanks church I want
[1:54:17] to thank the Lord the Lord has blessed
[1:54:19] me
[1:54:21] and the law was gracious to me I work
[1:54:25] and by the grace of God
[1:54:27] they gave me now
[1:54:30] a position
[1:54:32] to be the manager
[1:54:36] you feel that sense of responsibility
[1:54:39] praise the Lord
[1:54:40] and let me tell you
[1:54:42] pretty soon is going to affect the way
[1:54:44] you you dress to work
[1:54:47] is going to affect the way you do things
[1:54:50] at work because now you are a manager
[1:54:55] but all along you being the manager
[1:54:57] people
[1:54:58] you're being a manager
[1:55:01] Christ has given you that position
[1:55:06] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:55:10] to manage his life
[1:55:13] his love to a dying word
[1:55:16] praise the Lord
[1:55:18] amen
[1:55:23] you are a manager
[1:55:25] they just promote you
[1:55:28] you think you have the attitude to go to
[1:55:31] work when you want to go to work
[1:55:33] I'm a manager I bet I don't feel like
[1:55:35] going to work today
[1:55:37] and I'm the manager
[1:55:40] praise the Lord
[1:55:45] and you can just throw things off and
[1:55:47] you know and just care less about things
[1:55:56] you want to behave like a manager when
[1:55:58] when the CEO come around
[1:56:00] you have to be a manager at all times
[1:56:07] praise the Lord
[1:56:09] and brother Brown who talks about that
[1:56:15] slave in the auction
[1:56:19] his father was a king
[1:56:21] even though he was in Shadows but he
[1:56:24] behaved
[1:56:25] like the son of a king
[1:56:29] he might have had his legs chained
[1:56:33] but he behave it was not his dress
[1:56:35] called
[1:56:37] it was something in him
[1:56:39] that told him
[1:56:41] even though you are bound in Chains
[1:56:44] you are a son of the king boy
[1:56:46] behave like one
[1:56:49] and that's the same thing when the
[1:56:51] spirit of God the Holy Ghost come on the
[1:56:52] life of the believer
[1:56:54] he might be going through a trial you
[1:56:56] don't handle your hand your heads down
[1:56:58] and just whine
[1:57:00] and look for who to blame no
[1:57:03] you are a son of the king your father
[1:57:05] have Ten Thousand Candles on the hill
[1:57:08] you have the whole world in his hands
[1:57:14] inheritance is bigger than your problem

[1:57:21] bigger than your problem
[1:57:32] soul is just just to remind you
[1:57:36] want to go back and play that tip again

[1:57:56] it takes courage
[1:57:58] for a man of seven Great education

[1:59:42] coming through these doors on a
[1:59:44] Wednesday night
[1:59:46] or on a Sunday morning
[1:59:50] let's realize that

[2:00:00] we have the life of the people of the
[2:00:02] City of Minneapolis on our hands

[2:09:25] confused is that
[2:09:27] when you sell people like you go to a
[2:09:30] tour to a dinner it's not everything
[2:09:33] that serves you that you take
[2:09:35] so it's not everything that you sell
[2:09:37] people they will take sometimes they
[2:09:40] will refuse it
[2:09:41] but that should not make you to take on
[2:09:44] your apron and get that on the
[2:09:45] ground and walk away
[2:09:47] sometimes you are kind to people you are
[2:09:49] nice to them they will spit right in
[2:09:52] your face and then and they said nasty
