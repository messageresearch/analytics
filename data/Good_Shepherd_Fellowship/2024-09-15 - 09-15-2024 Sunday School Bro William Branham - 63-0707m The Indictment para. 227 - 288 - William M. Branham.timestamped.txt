[1:58] e e
[2:43] it's
[2:44] impossible that there guilty of the
[2:47] crucifixion of Jesus Christ and I indict
[2:49] them by the word of God that God is how
[2:52] do you indict them brother Brandon I
[2:53] indict them that God has clearly
[2:55] identified himself in his word in the
[2:57] last days and made himself to know that
[2:59] is still the same yesterday today and
[3:01] forever and they've coldly turned it
[3:03] down am amen Lord and you're guilty of
[3:07] the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by
[3:10] blaspheming the Holy
[3:12] Ghost that's right we take you on to
[3:14] Hebrews 10 Again word tells us again in
[3:18] the scriptures not only being impossible
[3:20] but you can never separate you from God
[3:23] eternally you can never come in the
[3:25] presence of God again when you turn down
[3:28] the Holy Ghost and make fun of it
[3:30] now see if tasted of the word see
[3:33] borderline Believers oh you say them
[3:35] guys wasn't believers they was Believers
[3:38] yes or professed Believers but when it
[3:40] come to the word they were Israel they
[3:43] come out under the blood they come out
[3:45] under the signs of Moses they had seen
[3:47] those signs working God said I'll take
[3:49] you over Yonder and when they come right
[3:51] down to the principle of the promised
[3:52] word that was to come what do they say
[3:54] oh we can't do it see and here they come
[3:57] back with grapes and everything to prove
[3:58] the lamb was right
[4:00] God's word's right God said I give it to
[4:02] you but the
[4:03] circumstances my I said we look like
[4:05] grasshoppers upside of we can't do no
[4:07] matter what a few years ago in this old
[4:10] Hull Studio as a tabernacle somebody
[4:12] come in walked out there and talked to
[4:14] me he said Billy you're going to preach
[4:16] to four post one of these days was
[4:17] messages like that I said I'll be
[4:19] preaching to four post because God's
[4:20] able them post to rise children of
[4:23] Abraham it's a truth I said if you got
[4:25] something that you can disprove it let's
[4:26] have it Hallelujah long a crow but when
[4:30] it comes to a place to show it that's
[4:34] different yes that's what makes a
[4:36] difference all right yeah with their
[4:38] Creeds they crucify him aresh now
[4:42] Hebrews the 6th chapter and we go on
[4:45] down we can just read on down on down in
[4:48] through here we got plenty of time I
[4:49] marked out a scripture here um where
[4:52] will be Hebrews the sixth chapter is I
[4:54] guess take it all impossible for those
[4:56] who were once inight and made partakers
[4:58] of the Holy Ghost we haven't got time to
[5:00] go too far because got another scripture
[5:01] I want you to read just in a moment
[5:02] notice this they crucify to themselves
[5:05] the Son of God aresh what do they do
[5:08] what by having a taste and knowing that
[5:11] it's the truth and then turn around and
[5:13] denying it yeah what you do it's
[5:16] impossible so that's what this nation
[5:19] has done that's what this people has
[5:21] done that's what these churches has
[5:24] done they've turned it down and they've
[5:28] crucified the message
[5:30] they've crucified the truth to the
[5:33] people how they do Jesus they put him to
[5:36] shame stripped his clothes off of him
[5:38] hung him up on a cross and nailed him up
[5:39] there the Prince of Life the same thing
[5:41] they've done today with their Creeds
[5:43] they've done the same thing they
[5:46] stripped the things they stripped the
[5:48] the goodness and the clothing of the
[5:50] Gospel by trying to place it somewhere
[5:52] else and hung him on the cross oh my why
[5:57] there they there they crucified now the
[6:00] last quotation
[6:02] him him this most precious person why
[6:05] did they do it they didn't know him why
[6:08] are they doing it today they don't know
[6:10] this is the truth they're they're dumb
[6:13] and blind of it they don't know it
[6:15] that's reason their Creeds and
[6:17] traditions has gotten them away from the
[6:20] word of God Amen now until you hear just
[6:23] in closing I pay close attention I know
[6:26] it's hot I'm hot too

[6:43] will be something that's already we're
[6:44] not testifying we know what he has done
[6:46] we know what he's going to do but now
