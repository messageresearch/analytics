prayer and last night I stepped out of the reception [Music] was getting a little bit tired and trying to get myself together but right after I stepped out then I got a call from Brother Wesley and

brother was here myself pray for her so I called back this morning to see how she was doing and he told me and after in an hour after we pray her body temperature starts to go up that she got she got

prepared mind to come and worship you father and also to be able to receive of you this morning you know our needs you know where each and every one of us and whether we like it or not we are all in one form of praising or another we've been talking about this great Apostle Paul that call himself a prisoner of Jesus Christ and father we want to use that as a mirror this morning and then look into your word and and have you to help us to see ourselves a little better Lord God and precious Lord we love you we thank you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord [Music] praise the Lord amen okay okay I'm sure I'm not Preaching Online preaching life amen because I it looks like I can hear the people online more than I can hear you praise the Lord Hallelujah we thank the Lord this morning and uh for giving us this privilege to be together now we we want to talk on the on on this hour subject of a prisoner of love we've been on it now now this is about the second week but I want to go into a place they are there uh are entitled the conflict between Ambitions and calling the conflict between Ambitions and calling praise the Lord amen we'll take our taking our inspiration from God's Prophet message her that he preached a prisoner and that's that's where we taking this inspiration from but we want to use that and just set it together a little bit praise the lord we want to use that and just study together believing that the Lord will use that and bless us this morning many years ago uh I got studying this I got caught into this thought and it really helped me it really helped me so this morning uh we will trust that the Lord will will be able to to bless us amen will be able to bless us so uh I'm going to take this phrase and then it will give you an idea of of where I took my inspiration from and I can see here where Paul was regarding I mean Paul was re uh let me let me take back again I can't see here where Paul was regretting anything so the Apostle Paul was not regretting and saying he was sorry he was a prisoner but he was addressing himself you I believe that Paul as he wrote this letter with that pain that it was the Holy Spirit causing him to write that that may be even in this night of this time that we might pull out we might pull out the context of our text to show why Paul did this because it's it's a scripture in scripture is intender amen because they are God's thoughts so that the Bible is able to address every situation in our life because the other thoughts of God I believe that sitting in their daily or jail that Paul wrote to his colleague here that his brother that he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ so he could express it by seeing what was around him now he was in jail but there wasn't what he was speaking of this servant of Christ and minister with him he was speaking there he was a prisoner told the word of Jesus Christ praise the Lord and just like we said that was where we got our book of Ephesians that was where we got our book of the letter to the Philippians the letter to the church in colusha the letter that Paul also wrote to the brethrens in laudisha that was where Paul wrote all of these great letters Sitting In Praise in Bound with chains praise the Lord and uh uh and just to to go back a little bit we we we kind of realize uh beginning this subject we spoke and and mentioned that God design it that way you look through the scripture you will see God's people in uh most ages you will find that uh they are always in praising we read about Joseph on Wednesday night and uh how uh he was he was there praising and bound in Fetters and that was where uh the the great interpretation that brought Deliverance to Egypt came it was right there in prison when when The Pick of Joseph gift was manifested and so there is there is something about praising and and Dania also went to praising God used that to be able to bring Babylon uh to to to know that there is only one true God praise the Lord amen so we see all through the scripture even our lord Jesus went to praise him and uh so there is something out that is that is uh you know we've we've uh this this uh praising thing we we see but yeah we realize that the Apostle Paul was not uh uh describing his physical condition but he was describing a spiritual condition he was this describing realizing that he have got to the place where he was no longer living his life by his own will he have realized that there was someone now that was in control because that is exactly what praising life is praise the Lord you don't eat when you want to eat amen you don't dress the way you want to dress they give you your prison suit amen Hallelujah and you will even realize even what has become faction with many of our young people hanging the God is sucking that's that's a dress code that came from praising that's a dress code because I mean it's one suit fit all praise the Lord they don't take your measurement before they sow your suit you just get there and hand it out to you so uh uh over time uh uh people from praising started bringing that faction can you imagine that we have a word we have a society now that have take that as a proper dressing code young old small big they're all sagging their their paints them praise the Lord amen can you imagine one where an inspiration comes from a prison style of dressing they have just affected the entire world they have gone beyond borders they have gone beyond language praise the Lord and Beyond ages sometimes we think where are some of the rest of our faction coming from true some of the things that people will kill themselves to do and they have no idea let's stick with the prison turns my mind is now turning in 20 different directions praise the Lord in 20 30 right different directions because now we have a society you know both old and young I mean piercing piercing is now the new faction everybody want to be PS praise the Lord which of course is also a faction that comes back from Biblical uh uh slavery days praise the Lord when a man refused to be free in the book of Exodus he was to go and tell his slave master and no longer want to be free you have been good to me I will stay with you the rest of my life and he was the Bible said he was taken to the doorpost and he was fierce and on I was hanged in his ear that's where that faction came from praise the Lord before then it used to be something that would distinguish men from women but not everybody is piercing so you can see that it was not God's design anyway let's stay with our praise and think you love the Lord now so we see here that uh Paul was describing a spiritual condition he was described in a spiritual condition because we know uh back in the book of of Arts we know what happened to Paul Paul is going to describe his conviction a little bit let's go to the book of Galatians let's go to the book of Galatians Paul is going to to describe and out of there we will we will be able to draw our we together in Galatians chapter 1 we we can breathe from the beginning but let's just drop down let's read from verse 10. Paul says for do I now persuade man or God or do I seek to please man for if I yet please man I should not be a servant of Christ but I satisfy your brethrens that the gospel which was preached of mean is not after man for I neither receive it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ for ye have heard of my conversation in the past in the Jewish religion how that beyond measure beyond measure in a sense above my crowd praise the Lord I was above my peers beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it praise the Lord the Believers after the days of uh of Arts they were arrested by the council they were they were they were flocked in public but when Paul stepped in his measure was to make sure that they are dead the beyond measure that Paul was talking about was I wanted to silent the church I was not locking them up in praising praise the Lord be your measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jewish religion above many my equal in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my father but when it please God who separated me from my mother's womb and call me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the headings immediately I confine that with flesh and blood praise the Lord May our soul write in this scripture there is two things that Paul described what he described is that above measure above my peers he says here I was profited in the Jewish religion above my equals being more zealous in the traditions of my fathers so in one sense Paul is describing a driving force that he had praise the Lord as a young man he had an ambition our our Ambitions is our driving force that's our natural driving force praise the Lord so Paul is saying that has something that was driving me naturally above all my peers I train myself in the traditions of the father I got one of the best teacher gamilia I went to one of the best schools in another episode in in in the book of Philippians he says I mean none of you guys can compare yourself to with me you want to talk about zeal I was so much aliens until I had the quotes of the man that stone steaming praise the Lord so he was describing his ambition but he said but it pleased God a please God who separated me from my mother womb and call me praise the Lord can we read that together and by his grace the Lord so with all the Ambitions that I had there was something that interfered it was a calling praise the Lord so Paul was caught in the conflict of ambition and calling praise the Lord and just like Paul many of us are also caught in that conflict of ambition and calling that's why we want to look at this morning or this afternoon as we trust the Lord to be our help amen so let's read a little bit here and the reading that we we started with foreign have been a great scholar in his days he had great ambition he was a man that that had been trained a fellow by the name of gamelia which was a great teacher in his days one of the greatest schools that he could have went to for instance like like we say is a Wheaton or Bob Jones or some great Fundamental School he had been taught as minister of the word and he was well educated even Peter said it that some of the things that Paul taught were very difficult to understand smart and an intelligent boy with a great ambition of maybe some days becoming a priest or a high Priests of the people he had an ambition and then to find that this great ambition he had been trained for and has spent all of his life from maybe the age of about eight or ten years or up to about 30 to 35 years old when he finished college and graduated and and how all of his diplomats and everything and stood in uh good with all the clergy even the high priests are Jerusalem he hired others from him person or others written and trusted with this great soul to go down to Damascus and find those down there that worship God contrary to what he said and to bound them and put them in jail if necessary he hire all this to put them to death but he wanted to he had great ambitions praise the Lord and now all that he had trained forth God had took it out took it all out of him see and what his objective was and what his father has spent his money for now I put that in there because sometimes parents have Ambitions for their children praise the Lord and and they don't consider that the child will have their own ambitions so pretty soon they become apparent and and children conflict because I want my child to be this you know and and uh but I mean we all are not built the same praise the lord we all are not designed the same and there are some of the things I want for us to look into this morning so all of the money that his parents Spain and the Ambitions of his father and his mother was all have been taken away from him because that God has something else God has something else praise the Lord and before we were born and before we came to this earth God taught Jeremiah from his mother womb that he ordained him to be a prophet he was called praise the Lord so our calling was right from the beginning right from the mind of God amen our our Ambitions met us here on Earth Our Calling is from heaven are we together amen are we together praise the Lord because you see this word many of the times we come into life conflict when we get into this conflict of what we want to be and what God wants us to be praise the Lord we have Ambitions to be different things in life which which is good we must be ambitious praise the Lord just like I said is the driving force for sources we must challenge ourselves praise the Lord and that's why we go to school amen that's why we learn things we must challenge ourselves we are having a society that uh is is is is robbing the Young Generation from there praise the Lord because it used to be where boys play in the dirt and then to take all cops and build cars they put their brains together but now they have a video game and they just sit there praise the Lord and you know it's it's another person that is now operating their brain because whoever put the game together they put the game together they are just involving you in what they have created praise the Lord I'm that I'm not bashing games I'm just I'm just bringing us to a place now so uh that's the driving force that we need to achieve our goals we must be ambitious we must challenge ourselves praise the Lord if we are not ambitious we will have people to blame we will start looking for who to blame we blame the society we blame everything we blame our parents but we must also realize we have a calling for an internal purpose praise the Lord now the god that brought us here on Earth that place us here on Earth he have a purpose for our life praise the Lord we are designed to fulfill an internal purpose that's God's plan since we are not God we must get doing things we might get challenging ourselves until God meet us or until we understand what his plan is for our life are we together with me we will we get into some few things this morning you know I always don't finish my message so I'm not worrying about it praise the Lord as long as we can be able to drive to our point that we want to get to there's uh that would be enough you see when God make man look back in Genesis the Bible says God make man in his own image male and female he made them and he blessed them and he told them to multiply and replenish now you have to realize that that was before the sex art praise the Lord tomato plot and replying that she is now only limited to the sex eyes that where we want to limit it talk about God's intention for man was to be productive productive is not just having children productive is being creative because we are made in this image and he is the creator are we together Jesus in Saint John chapter 15. he will say is I am divine you are the branches praise the Lord and he said the father rejoice when he sees the branches bringing forth more fruit that's being productive he says in the branch I'm not bringing fruit then it is cut down it is thrown in the fire are we together it's cut down and it's thrown in the fire so God warned his children to be productive are we together so we see this picture as we as we are traveling together here we have uh uh a a Divine calling that God had in his mind concerning each and every one of us whether you like it or not you never brought yourself here on Earth the one that brought you here has a purpose for your life praise the Lord and I I can challenge you this morning you can never beat that purpose you will never beat that purpose before life gets out of your body the god that brought you to this earth will make sure that you fulfill his will praise the Lord you can beat that purpose the same way you don't have the key to your heartbeat you only have the key to your engine your car engine but your heartbeat you don't have the key praise the Lord he has the key he started the engine this morning praise the Lord while you were sleeping and all the way he was the one kicking the pedal praise the Lord you don't have the key to your heartbeat so the god that has the key to your heartbeat he is going to beat that heart until you meet his purpose praise the Lord and then when you meet his purpose he parked the car and he says come home thank you [Applause] so it's very easy when we surrender to God praise the lord it's very easy when we understand that true concept of life that there is a great intelligence that is involved in the Affairs of men praise the Lord I knew there was somewhere I wanted to start this morning but I've gone ahead of myself amen praise the Lord okay I think we are at a good place I think I get you at a good place so I don't want to lose you so let me just stay with where we are praise the Lord amen God commissioned for man to re multiplied and replenish was before the sex act we see our lord Jesus picking that up is in John chapter 15 as we said he speaks of what Rejoice the father if he sees his children being productive so God is interested in us being productive Hallelujah and for us to be productive we must have a driving force we must have a driving force praise the Lord and that's why we're talking about this morning they are the Ambitions that we have the aspirations and things that we want to do is it's good to think you want to be a pilot I mean it's it's free talking it you don't pay money for it you don't download that thought you don't have to pay money to download to think about being be in the pilot think about it but then get the courage to to uh to pursue it I mean think about being a medical doctor think about I mean think about being the president of the United States it's free taught amen the FBI not going to arrest you for that it's not a cool to think about being the president praise the Lord and you just think about it all the things that we enjoy Siri where is Walmart somebody thought about that someone thought about someone thought about that we're driving we're living in a world that is driving down to to a place of this uh artificial intelligence which of course Covey brought us to a place where the words started exploding it when there was no workers there were bunch of artificial intelligence that were built in Japan and China that was working in the hospital praise the Lord well you can't even see the person because it's covered the the plants are there you are on the other side you're talking to a robot if you think you're talking to a nurse what's your name my name is Juan what are you suffering with yeah you're talking to a robot and you you dared him you're happy that you're talking to a nurse somebody thought about it somebody thought about it just like we we said before and we know a sign said we are not using 10 percent of our brain intelligence with all the invention that is in the word men have not exploited 10 percent for the power of his brain praise the Lord and now you can see why the devil choose the mind for a Battleground because he knows the potential you have when you can put your brain to work you can step in the word of possibilities that's why we're having mental crisis because if the devil can abuse your mind he can make you useless if he can just put you in a praising of your mind he can make you useless you don't have no strength you don't have no driving power you know I desire to do anything all you have to do is just make you believe that everybody hates you if you can just keep that on your mind praise the Lord he likes you right in your bedroom because even when you look at yourself in a mirror you feel like he hit me praise the Lord we are not using up to 10 percent that's what I'm saying rob me from praise the Lord when man fell in Genesis 3 that was how long he fell to come to using less than 10 percent of his intelligence now we have a self-driving cars and and all of these things and man is still using less than 10 percent think about when we get above that see how Medical Science have advanced the kind of for surgery I saw the uh uh uh uh uh a soldier and uh man I I'm telling you we have an awesome God praise the Lord and I at the hospital did I worked in the surgery area so sometimes we are down in the theater doing things and you hear the you know Sergeant going on I mean sometimes the doctors really get to work you think that they are they are knocking an old car you just yet backpack bout human body praise the Lord and uh and and and sometimes and I mean they're kind of for success the way medical signs have advanced and it's all because someone got an inspiration someone got to thinking someone put their brain to positive thinking and they've got to drive they've got a a a motivation they've got a driving force behind it praise the Lord why people who spend their time you know doing all the things uh you know all through the night we are people that don't sleep they are looking for the next answer to cancer they are looking for what can we do to solve this problem are we together we have a driving force God give it to us it's in you you are born with it you just need to activate it you just need to activate it you need to come into the right environment and challenge yourself get around positive people that's all you need to do it's in you so we we see that was how this young Paul was he had an ambition a young man he was privileged his father had a Roman citizenship so he was one of the elite Jews and went to good school and he was trained went to the best college and now coming out he have this ambition and it was right at a time where Christianity was also Rising after the date of Pentecost and Peter and all these fishermen are out preaching the gospel I mean when Paul goes Check in his uh in his school list he don't find no name like Peter James just to know that these guys are fishermen and the Bible says they are turning the word upside down Paul was angry you mean why why are we from the Seminary can do that and this man had no education is turning the word upside down praise the Lord he said I got to do something about it we got to stop this move and I mean he was out there to impress he took a permission he had the right to arrest to even kill praise the Lord and you know that just exactly what it is with uh with a freshman a college graduate his first job praise the Lord he get his necktie right his soul right and then when he made the word of reality it is sometimes different you got to loosen the necktie and four of your sleeves praise the Lord because the word of reality is not a classroom is bigger than the classroom now so we see that yeah and then uh you know we we we get to this place there was one other thing that was on my mind this morning and uh you know I'm not I'm not afraid to be in trouble I've been in so many trouble but I was thinking also with with this god-giving driving force that we are born with how we misunderstand when the Messenger will speak about woman place the Lord and we will come to the conclusion that the place of a woman is in the kitchen if God has ordained that he will not give her a driving force she will not be born with ambition God did not ordain that we created because of misunderstanding are we address it this morning praise the Lord amen I wear dressy this morning now you will realize by Nature because of the three sacrifices that was given to a woman a man does not have it the three sacrifices you and like I said here you never go nowhere in the world you go and the king of God in class is taught by a man nowhere in Word because the patience that men have is short for children is designed for women because God gave them a god-giving ability to be mothers right from China like to play with doors implied heads and do things they also like to be pretty yeah it's India nature praise the Lord now so when their god-giving nature of these three sacrifices you it gives them the ability to multitask science say women can multitask more than men praise the Lord are we together now there is a place for all of these and that we will trust the Lord to help us now so the woman have this God gave inability because it's in her God blessed in her amen that's the reason why he shot the heavens shot the Earth everywhere was back because of redemption he gave the woman these attributes is given to her bavechio now so you you will see that uh with this that is given to the woman I'm trying to bring my thoughts right that you will not mix understand me amen I'm not preaching a women Liberation many message this morning that's not what I'm preaching praise the Lord because you see despite a woman is giving this ability that she has out of this ability God also gave her a protection amen the place of the man a Garland man is to keep those abilities in check that's the reason why she must submit to her husband praise the Lord because a woman with the potential she has she can be good if she wants to be good never never take her in a race amen because she can be good and she can be evil if she want to praise the Lord are we together it's all in her makeup now so I I mean I thought about this because I've always believed that for every child of God whoever the man or the woman our god-giving place is to stay behind the word is to stay behind the word of God keep her in the kitchen if she's not behind the word praise the Lord she would turn the kitchen to a cup or to a halot house whether the man or the woman for every child of God our god-giving position is to stay behind the word for man shall not lay by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God praise the Lord so as we talk about ambition think about this a man sent his daughter to school he go she goes to school and you know she she got this degree in and she's working you know she has she has this driving force to be a nurse all she want to be a a surgeon she just had this drive before there is something that just took her from small maybe she saw a crying baby she want to be uh you know in the infants section that's what she wanted status you want a ticket she want to improve baby's life and she have all of this think about this now see this design and she said it and and she go to school and she gets out of this degree but in her also she feels like uh not that she feels in her the desire is to be a wife a mother praise the Lord it's the funny scenario but it's truth and then I you know she she starts studying she she finished with her status she's working and uh I mean she's out there uh and then uh she gets married and then when she gets married expecting her first child she turned out to have a twins praise the Lord amen amen now you can see that she had an ambition amen and she followed that drive but when she meets this Junction or fulfilling something that she's called to do she's called to be a wife that's a mother or Womanhood and to be a mother now it brings us to the place now she have these babies it does not have to be twins or triplets it just just one baby and she feels like I need to give all the Care to my baby praise the Lord this part I have this ambition I have achieved but now that I'm married I you know I have a husband and and the husband is doing well and and now she's a mother when it comes to that time of her life praise the Lord and she feels that I think I feel more happy being a wife to stay in the conference of my home praise the Lord amen now so what happened is that she have found a god-giving calling there are surpassed her ambition praise the Lord amen amen oh no but it's wrong to say as well she must leave the job market she must leave her career because her place is at home who says that praise the Lord when the prophet spoke about a warmer place you have to realize their child if you if you check all the religious uh uh uh uh uh uh literature that is out there there is no one that explains the three sacred that you off a woman than William Branham nobody speaks about the three sacred virtue that is God gave it to a woman no one brought it in a religious text for us to understand it and we know that is given to the woman because of redemption that's the reason why she was promised the seed of the woman God never said the seed of the man will bruised the step in hand but he said the seed of the woman are we together you see that's the reason why when he explained that he let us to know it must be a conversation we must talk about it we must look at the knees of our home the needs of our family because every family is designed different praise the Lord are we together and if the husband and wife see a faith that they will be able to meet their family needs they can place it before the Lord and I believe the Lord will bless it praise the Lord but if we will start using God's word to intimidate God's children is never going to produce and Original Seed is never going to praise the lord it's never going to because the moment you you you start to send your children to school you are challenging them to be ambitious you set them down you do their homework you are telling look at this mouth think about two apple and one apple you are challenging your mind to be creative you have you have already stealed that thing in them and then when they get to school then realize another person is is is is always getting 10 over 10 and they are not getting 10 over things they challenge themselves I think I can do that myself then stop becoming ambitious to go to the next class and then you start asking them from a young age what you want to be when you grow up what are you doing you are staring in them then after all of that you say okay I send you to school you have gone to school you have graduated everything your place is the kitchen are we together but what we are looking at this morning is at the place where many many of our Ambitions come in Conflict there was one poor experience on the road of Damascus yeah he had this ambition in him he have gotten clearance from the clergy he was going to persecute the church and he's met on the road of Damascus with this light I am Jesus who you are persecuting I set you aside I'm going to use you a complete above face a 360 turn praise the Lord God turning around so much that he couldn't even see he got blind praise the Lord now this man with all of his knowledge and everything he has learned will be brought to the place so go back the very Torah that he studied he will go back and re-read that Torah to realize that the Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus of the new he will go back and realize that all the things that are taught in the Old Testament were Shadows of things in the new praise the Lord I have an echo back there that's good it means my word is hating somewhere sometimes it's good for the children to say because the person is sitting clothes might not hear what I said because their mind is too busy praise the Lord so do you understand what I'm saying and have you felt like that I'm not just here to tell our stories but I'm trying to bring every one of us to this place have you felt that you have come in a conflict well what was your ambitions praise the Lord amen that you have come in a conflict you see like just like he said Paul was not regretting because when a person understands what is the calling for their life you don't regret praise the Lord if you are regretting then you are in arrested we need to help you praise the Lord there you are in a worst state if you will think that alive that was live out there with our Christ now that you are called to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you are regretting how my life out there you have a serious problem you have a very serious problem praise the Lord he was not regretted at all he have come to understand praise the Lord he have come to honest him thereby the grace of God I'm called into this holy calling I can see my life I can see the you know and all my peers there was not like unto me I look at the zoo as I see my status I see my gray but I'm happy I'm happy to know Jesus I'm happy to know Jesus because the peace that I experience there is nothing out there that can give it to me praise the Lord amen there is nothing out there that can give it to me am I I have my ambitions and career and achievement and with all the cash that it will be bringing me if God is not in the mess you be having Broken Heart trying to get a glass of alcohol to calm your nerves praise the Lord if you are unfortunate somebody might put you on drugs he was not regretting and many times that's the conflict we come into now if you set it down I don't have time to read we'll check on that a little bit well you talk about how Moses you have to realize when when when when Jacob put him on the river he went right into Pharaoh house and Moses own sister called his mother Moses mother took care of him and she was paid and being a mother she influenced her son to believe that he's not an Egyptian he's a Hebrew and that create an up to deliver praise the Lord and create an ambition in him to let his people go so right where he came here she started thinking how am I going to do the Bible said he will learn in the wisdom of Egypt Moses decided to challenge himself I'm going to learn everything that Egypt offered so I can use it to deliver my people that is the ambition that he had praise the Lord but God had a different place God had a different plan Moses was thinking about machine gun god prepared a drastic for him praise the Lord Hallelujah he went many years to the colleges of Egypt God prepared one day in the presence of the pillar of Fire it would change his life praise the Lord he fulfilling his ambition he killed an Egyptian but yet he never gained favor with his people do you want to kill us the way you kill that Egyptian Moses Got a Friend and he ran away in trying to fulfill his ambition to deliver them do you see if your calling is not influencing your ambition you get in trouble you get in trouble because you have to know there is a Divine intelligence that is controlling the Affairs of men on Earth we are not just born and left here to decide for ourselves we have some decisions but how many of the things you have decided have been fulfilled who is the one that is changing the cost of the things you have taught and the things you have decided if you are the one that is fully in control are we together now Moses came to the place where his ambition has failed he he felt like a failure you see many people going to school and and they want to do certain things nursing and and they're not making a great they feel like they feel like they just Dash everything that's how Moses fared like a failure got himself back in the desert a man that went to school learned in the knowledge of the Egyptians he was taking care of sheeps amen he found himself a new job to be following sheeps why because he felt like a failure his ambition the inspiration of his mother telling him you were born on a sign you are born for a purpose you are born as a promised child we were crying to God for the delivery of the day you were born God watch over you in the alligator water Moses you are special you are not an Egyptian all of those things fill his he said praise the Lord his mother never told him you would meet a Bernie booch her mother never taught him 40 years you will be in the wilderness she never knew nothing praise the Lord in his ambition but his calling never failed Hallelujah still in his ambition by his calling never killed when he met God in the burning bush he was more ready to face Egypt then all he have learned praise the Lord he was more ready to face Egypt praise the Lord when you meet God that's what happened you are more ready to face your fear when you meet God you are more ready to face your fear hallelujah amen I learned in all the military wisdom of Egypt and said go tell pharaoh to let my people go don't you realize what privilege we have to know these things that we can't keep our minds in competition want to be like other people praise the lord we can challenge ourselves we can Inspire ourselves but we know that there is a Divine Purpose of our life and we keep asking God what is your way for my life how many young people have ruined their life running after ambitions when God is dealing with them to bring them to a place of calling praise the Lord and they have gone and they have gone and they have gone and it gets to adjunction and they don't know what's what's the purpose of life praise the Lord the gastro destruction of Life they don't know what the purpose what next should I do you miss your exit praise the Lord you miss your answer the place you're supposed to turn or you miss it praise the Lord and you have to remember God said this in the days of Noah my spirit we're not always drive with men you having your day of visitation you having your day of visitation when God is dealing with you the Bible says this is the dead of the Lord yanking to his voice amen why he's dealing with you because when you miss your days a day of visitation you're going to put yourself in a Wilderness confusion looking for satisfaction looking for peace and you will just be wondering about because at a time God was dealing with you you miss it are we together look at this in question and answers is he your boss says now yeah I know I preached the gospel I preach the gospel that's my duty I'm a preacher he's a preacher but never is a preacher that's my duty to preach well that's just what I'm supposed to do but let me do something Paul says that beyond that now I have got a right to take money up or take up money Paul says but I'm glory to make tents just to show you I can sacrifice so what what is it driving here also is to help us to understand that uh uh uh uh even even at a time where we find Our Place we find Our Calling it still does not destroy your talents your calling does not destroy the abilities that you have praise the Lord they're calling only identify what you are called to do but beyond that there are other abilities you have praise the Lord that's the thing that I make end time preachers to be money beggers because we think when we are called it all we have to do is just preach Paul says I was also a tin maker right are we together said it's honorable marriage is Honorable among all the dead on the fire he said that in Hebrew it's good for the man tomorrow he says I got a ride tomorrow he said that to the Corinthians and now I could be married I got a legal right to marry but I just won't marry I want to do another sacrifice for the Lord praise the Lord is believed they are poor after meeting his calling he got so consumed in the death of Stephen that he realized that he took a male life for this cause and he was ready to give his life for the very same cause so he decided that he's going to lay that's the reason why when when the prophecy came and uh that that change was awaiting Paul he despised the prophecy you say I'm ready to go to Rome to die for this gospel are we together now so you see it put us in a place it's all about being being creative it's all about being productive praise the Lord some of the great mans that you see preaching they are men of great skills amen I know brother Johnny he's a man he's a man that works with wood he likes he likes he likes making things sending wood and you know fixing things so he have his little uh Main Place in his house where he go in he's always faces something praise the Lord because God is a god of balance amen he's a god of balance because what a man does as a as a preacher he lives in a realm of inspiration it's a ram that is so powerful that if a man do not know how to bring himself out and how to go in he may cause his life praise the Lord amen that's one of the reasons why our age is for a bunch of lying prophecies because people try to force themselves in this realm of prophesying in this realm of seeing visions until they see all sorts of things that don't exist why because we want to make great impression we have taken it as a career the ministry is not a career it's a calling career is why you go to school to learn and to live off of yeah what am I preaching praise the Lord so Paul speaks here he says some you notice of the word and and uh uh uh every man he said every man knows his calling some units of the word of God's sake and so forth we want to do something beyond our duty and if you are really born again of the spirit of God and says that's my duty to go to church I guess I will have to go well I want to do more than that I want to win souls for Christ I want to do something I want to visit the sick in the hospital it's my duty to preach a funeral is my duty to preach the gospel it's my duty to pray for the sake let me do something else let me get out and do something where God will honor Me by it amen why because you're calling a do not take your driving force praise the Lord hey don't take your driving force they don't take that uh that drive that you have to become better to improve in what you are doing praise the Lord I just asked I'm talking about Steve yesterday I said I just I feel so sick if I'm not prepared before I get to church I feel so sick and I'm one of the most confused man if I don't take a time and prepare myself before I get to church I'm not smart so I just need a little time to prepare myself praise the Lord and that's the reason as an eagle serve her net I read this and we close and that's the reason God like him his church onto egos because the ego the Eagles net which is Wishes the church is built far beyond the kids of this word out of the danger lying across the blood where the Marvin proud Predator never gets to he said you are a city that is set on the hill a candle that's LED in a room or something the Church of the Living God is built high on high ambitions praise the Lord we must come to church every time to have a good service that must be your driving force that brings you here praise the Lord to come and have a good service the coming service must be better than the one today because that's how the ego saw it goes High one a year of a church that hasn't got any ambition to grow there is something wrong with that church the Church of the Living God has a high ambition we want to see the power of God back in church we want to see a life that is produced a life of this insect praise the Lord not a church that is filled with a bunch of scanders where is the power of God do you know in in the first church in the in the book of Arts a person coming in telling lie fall down and die what is the honesty what is the truth when the scripture said lie now one on to another because that's where my mind was this morning do you know that the greater think the hardest thing ever for God is to get one believe in another praise the Lord that's the hardest thing for God with all other things that people saw in Moses it was hard for them to believe in they gave you all the trouble in the wilderness but yet the Bible says in John chapter 12 Jesus said he says when the Holy Ghost comes one word sparking against it would not be forgiven all right that's why I wanted to begin this morning why because God will be using humans just like you and he want for us to acknowledge he wants for us to look beyond the flesh look beyond the man look beyond the woman and see the blood that was spelled for every one of us it gave us Grace to be able to deal with one another patient to bear with one another amen we don't become so critical and judgmental everybody should do things my way if everybody was like you you would not even like yourself close here another thing the Church of the Living God is built high because a gods hard anticipation and expectation expectation is the bearing ground for the supernatural because the people are not expecting that's what nothing happened we come to church dried and we go from church Drive we must come with expectation it's always the bearing ground for the supernatural that's the reason why the dead scenes will rise up first and we will go and meet them because every one of them died with an anticipation that Jesus was coming in their day every one of them died of Glory in the rapture of not tasting death so because they went down with that expectation that anticipation in them that's why we resurrect them that's why they will come at first because when Paul talks about the rapture he said we that are alive he didn't say you that would be alive he was expecting it in his day he said we that are alive and remain will be caught up to me the Lord in the air are we together the Church of the Living God has hard anticipation expectation well we belong to the church our fatherself for many years not just all the history of what we used to be when we used to be why are we now let's not make the past our hero amen the past should not be our hero because God is the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord there are a lot of good things here I can't finish all today let the musician comes let's give the Lord a hand of praise thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord Hallelujah praise the Lord let's think about it each and every one of us are you feeling trouble [Music] are you in a conflict do you feel like this Grace has robbed you or do you feel that this Grace has dressed you I think this grace of God has dressed me it has not robbed me it has not robbed me it has dressed me you have made me a better man [Music] praise the Lord it teach me to be responsible [Music] let's buy our house together while the musician plays Softly I don't know where you are this morning I don't know how you feel I know many of us have had different ambitions but like the old saying says word there is life there is hope [Music] yourself you don't have to feel like a failure no matter what you want wanted to be in life you have to be glad Wherever You Are and if you think you are in the worst place you all you are in a situation that you don't want to be in then there is Grace for you there's a God that can bring you out that's a god that can put you to the place where he wants you to be [Music] or maybe you wanted to be a secretary or you want at some position but now you find yourself to be a housewife a mother to your children a wife to your husband if you feel in a sense of regret I want to say to you this afternoon

father we owe you our life or to be thankful father God [Music] if your grace never caught us if your grace never arrested us just like you did to part on the road of Damascus foreign lord I can't

row of Damascus I want to be thankful that you stopped me Lord the Lord you turn my life around [Music] that I can be able to identify the holy calling called every son and every daughter of God father because that is the greatest calling the greatest calling on Earth is to be a Son of God is to be a daughter of God that's the greatest calling dear father I pray for every hair that is bowed

owner trials Lord [Music] we have seen the things that have happened [Music] we had our better days there are a lot of testimonies of the things that your grace have done in this building and father we want to challenge ourselves for God oh I pray father Senate driving force because you said the Dynamics of this last day of church will be the refilling of the Holy Ghost oh that's the driving power of the Church of God precious Lord father where brothers and sisters so Lord we stop sitting on the shelf of God we can get to Father Lord to a place and Lord Our Father this is the place we call Church this is the place we bring our family God there is nobody that can make it better than we that come here there's nobody that can keep it clean no one can bring sense of decency if the power of God will ever come to this place is because the people here are hungry for it I pray father May there be Lord as we come into the servant so God of of dedication this coming week oh God
