[37:44] hey man
[37:45] we believe he abides with us this
[37:48] evening here we know that he's here in
[37:50] our midst where he said wherever two or
[37:52] three are gathered in my name there i
[37:54] will be
[37:55] and we are here i can see more than two
[37:58] or three so we can be of one thing
[38:00] assured and that he is here with us
[38:03] if no one else is here if maybe your
[38:06] your friend's not here your family's not
[38:08] here you can be sure of one thing he is
[38:11] here and he's come to meet your need
[38:13] where you stand
[38:15] musicians go ahead and take a seat now
[38:18] we'll just jump right into the message
[38:20] here if you turn with me to the book of
[38:24] ephesians 6
[38:25] and we're going to read
[38:28] let's see here
[38:33] it's actually i gave them a different
[38:36] set of verses but let's start at verse
[38:38] 12
[38:40] and we're just going to
[38:41] read through here it's going to be a
[38:43] little bit long but bear with me
[38:46] all right if you're there to say amen
[38:50] all right
[38:52] it says for we wrestle
[38:53] not against flesh and blood but against
[38:55] principalities against powers against
[38:58] rulers of the darkness of this world
[39:01] against spiritual wickedness in high
[39:03] places
[39:04] wherefore
[39:05] take unto you the whole armor of god
[39:08] that ye may be able to
[39:10] to withstand in the evil day
[39:12] and having done all to stand
[39:15] stand therefore
[39:17] having your loins girt about with truth
[39:20] and having on the breastplate of
[39:21] righteousness your feet shod with the
[39:24] preparation of the gospel of peace
[39:27] above all taking the shield of faith
[39:30] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[39:32] the fiery darts of the wicked
[39:34] take the helmet of salvation and the
[39:36] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[39:39] god
[39:40] praying always with all prayer and
[39:42] supplication in the spirit
[39:44] and watching there unto with all
[39:46] perseverance and supplication for all
[39:48] saints
[39:50] and for me that utterance may be given
[39:52] unto me
[39:54] that i may
[39:56] open my mouth boldly to make known the
[39:59] mystery of the gospel
[40:01] for which i am an ambassador in bonds
[40:04] that therein i may speak boldly
[40:07] as i ought to speak you may be seated
[40:13] if you would just turn with me also to
[40:16] philippians chapter 1 verse 14. it's got
[40:20] two little verses
[40:22] here and philippians 1 verse 14
[40:31] and it says and many of the brethren in
[40:33] the lord waxing confident by my bonds
[40:37] are much more bold to speak the word
[40:40] without fear
[40:42] then with just one verse you can turn
[40:43] with if you'd like if not
[40:45] it's just real short here proverbs 28
[40:49] verse 1.
[40:53] and it says the wicked flee when no man
[40:56] pursueth
[40:57] but the righteous
[40:59] are bold as a lion
[41:01] let's just go before the lord
[41:03] heavenly father lord we just come before

[41:27] and that presence of god into this room
[41:30] father lord

[42:40] call it out of that
[42:42] you see in in these scriptures i read
[42:44] there's a little bit of a
[42:46] um
[42:48] parallel
[42:49] that i want to take and that is
[42:52] maybe for our text i want to take stand
[42:54] boldly with confidence in your position
[42:57] in christ
[43:00] um
[43:01] now in ephesians 6 there when we read i
[43:04] read the whole thing i just thought that
[43:06] first few verses were gave us a lot of
[43:08] context to maybe feed off of giving us
[43:11] instructions on how to move forward with
[43:14] standing boldly
[43:17] but i want to focus in on paul you know
[43:19] paul here he's writing to the ephesians
[43:22] and he's got to a place in his life
[43:23] where he's been imprisoned in rome he's
[43:26] he's at the end of his ministry
[43:29] and if there was anyone
[43:31] who had stood boldly
[43:34] for the
[43:35] word and for the message of jesus christ
[43:38] you would think it would be
[43:40] paul the apostle
[43:43] with all the things he had been through
[43:45] leading up to that beaten shipwrecked
[43:49] he had died and been brought back to
[43:50] life
[43:52] stoned to death
[43:55] with all these things he would think man
[43:56] if anyone has the courage and boldness
[43:58] to stand up it would have to be paul and
[44:01] yet paul even in this position he's
[44:03] reaching out to them and he's saying
[44:04] pray for me
[44:07] pray for me
[44:08] that i may open my mouth boldly now it's
[44:11] important
[44:12] to now take what he states the reason
[44:15] why he's going to be opening his mouth
[44:17] boldly
[44:18] because we could run with anything
[44:20] boldly
[44:22] and you could just become a complete
[44:24] fool
[44:27] right
[44:28] but he says to make known the mystery of
[44:31] the gospel
[44:32] see it has a focus it has a purpose
[44:35] and on down he says for which i am an
[44:38] ambassador in bonds
[44:40] now
[44:41] i thought about that for a moment and
[44:42] most people think well
[44:44] he's talking about his imprisonment in
[44:46] rome
[44:47] but you see i don't think so
[44:49] when he says i'm an ambassador in bonds
[44:51] we know he said he was a prisoner of
[44:54] love
[44:55] to the gospel of jesus christ
[44:58] you see because he'd been imprisoned
[44:59] before many places
[45:01] and that had never held him down
[45:04] those shackles those physical shackles
[45:07] never held him in place
[45:10] he'd seen god deliver him out of that
[45:13] but he's letting him know i'm an
[45:15] ambassador in bonds to this gospel
[45:20] and he's asking him that i therein i
[45:22] that therein i may speak boldly as i
[45:24] ought to speak
[45:27] so he's asking for prayer to
[45:30] support him
[45:31] in still continuing to speak no matter
[45:33] where his position or placing currently
[45:36] in a physical condition whether that be
[45:38] prison or standing before nero
[45:43] that he would still without fear or
[45:45] favor
[45:46] still speak just as boldly as if he was
[45:49] standing before the lowliest
[45:52] of individuals
[45:54] that his message would not change
[45:56] that his conduct would not change that
[45:59] which he did would not change
[46:03] okay
[46:11] in hebrews 4
[46:14] 14-16
[46:16] it says seeing then that we have a great
[46:18] high priest that is passed into the
[46:20] heavens
[46:21] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[46:24] our profession
[46:27] for we have not an high priest which
[46:29] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[46:31] our infirmities
[46:32] but was in all points tempted like as we
[46:35] are yet without sin
[46:38] let us therefore come boldly
[46:41] unto the throne of grace
[46:43] that we may
[46:44] obtain mercy
[46:45] and find grace
[46:47] to help
[46:48] in a time of need
[46:50] so you see once again
[46:52] the re there's a reason for the boldness
[46:58] it's not for your own profit
[47:00] it's not to prove what a great
[47:02] individual you are it's not for your own
[47:05] edification but there's a purpose and a
[47:08] reason even for coming boldly before the
[47:10] throne of grace
[47:12] one was to obtain mercy
[47:15] the next was to find grace
[47:17] and the reason for both of those is to
[47:19] help in a time of need
[47:24] so it's going before the throne boldly
[47:27] in a request for mercy and grace to
[47:30] equip you to help someone else in a time
[47:34] of need
[47:36] you see that same equipping was
[47:38] happening in that entire suit of armor
[47:40] that paul was speaking of
[47:42] leading all the way up because it was
[47:44] those things that have put in place
[47:47] properly in your life that will allow
[47:49] you and give you that boldness correctly
[47:53] okay
[47:54] so i want to just bring a little bit of
[47:57] current context
[47:58] you know we know that we can always take
[48:00] a look at what's happening around us in
[48:01] our current world
[48:03] and realize that
[48:05] the natural type spiritual
[48:08] and if we can see something happening in
[48:10] the natural we know there's something
[48:11] happening in the spiritual
[48:13] and right now
[48:16] everybody
[48:17] is pushing the world
[48:19] be loud
[48:20] be proud be bold put yourself out there
[48:24] express yourself make yourself known
[48:27] that's what all the social media is
[48:29] about that's what the constant news
[48:31] coverage is about that's what everyone
[48:33] is trying to make a mark on the world
[48:37] and yet it's all for their own
[48:39] glorification it's all for their own
[48:41] edification
[48:43] everything is about me me me
[48:46] you know no matter what it is it's it's
[48:49] even in in
[48:50] most of the things that we do and use
[48:52] it's all
[48:54] things that focus on glorifying self
[48:59] it's about coming out and and showing
[49:01] the world who you are
[49:05] you see
[49:08] and many times
[49:10] we as christians we we think oh well
[49:12] we're supposed to be humble and yes you
[49:14] are
[49:15] humble
[49:17] but not hiding
[49:21] there's a difference
[49:23] you see jesus christ was humble
[49:25] but when he stood before pilate and
[49:27] pilate told him don't you know that i
[49:30] have the ability and power to take your
[49:33] life
[49:34] and jesus humbly
[49:36] but boldly told him you have no power
[49:39] for what i give you
[49:42] i lay down my life
[49:45] because i have a purpose for that
[49:48] you have no power you're simply
[49:51] fulfilling a role in prophecy that you
[49:54] cannot escape
[49:58] you see
[49:59] but there was a purpose there was a
[50:02] boldness he could stand as the scripture
[50:04] said bold as a lion
[50:07] knowing his position in the scripture
[50:10] he was not in fear
[50:12] he was in a lot of pain
[50:14] but he was not in fear
[50:19] he knew what was happening he knew what
[50:21] was going to happen and he knew it was
[50:23] fulfilling scripture so he could stand
[50:26] there
[50:27] and in humility
[50:29] yet still know where he stood boldly
[50:33] no one could take that from him
[50:39] same thing
[50:41] paul
[50:42] he requested
[50:45] to be taken to rome
[50:48] okay he wasn't dragged to rome
[50:52] he knew what the end would possibly be
[50:56] he knew where it went where it would end
[50:58] he'd been given a directive from god
[51:00] almighty
[51:02] and nothing
[51:04] was going to stop him
[51:06] from completing that and going through
[51:08] with thus saith the lord for his life
[51:17] so
[51:22] i have a few examples
[51:24] through scripture
[51:25] it's important that anytime we look at
[51:27] something
[51:28] that we know that we can find it in
[51:30] scripture
[51:32] and see what happened
[51:34] now like i said there's a difference
[51:35] between boldness
[51:37] and another word very similar and
[51:39] brashness
[51:42] okay
[51:43] in order to be truly bold you have to
[51:45] know where you stand
[51:47] and know that there's no backing down
[51:51] but brashness is one who ventures
[51:55] and and their mouth opens and it's their
[51:57] as scripture says as
[51:59] clouds blown about without water
[52:06] waves tossed upon the sea wherever it
[52:08] drives them
[52:09] in the moment
[52:11] they just
[52:12] open up
[52:13] and there's nothing there
[52:17] and there's
[52:18] examples of this through scripture
[52:21] in acts chapter 19 i actually won't read
[52:24] i'll just go over the story
[52:27] there was the seven sons of siva
[52:30] and if you don't know who that was these
[52:32] were seven sons of a high priest
[52:36] a jewish high priest they were in the
[52:38] ministry
[52:41] but they did not have a real revelation
[52:44] for themselves
[52:45] of jesus christ
[52:47] they had seen someone else's life and
[52:49] they had seen the works the mighty works
[52:52] and the miracles and the respect it
[52:53] brought them
[52:55] and they wanted that they wanted power
[53:00] and they went forward with what appeared
[53:01] to be boldness but was brashness
[53:06] and they went to one who was possessed
[53:08] of the devil
[53:10] of an evil spirit
[53:12] and they said
[53:14] by
[53:16] we adjure you by jesus whom paul
[53:19] preaches
[53:22] see they had no boldness
[53:26] they were standing on the shoulders and
[53:27] authority of somebody else
[53:30] trying to manipulate that to see if it
[53:32] would work for them
[53:35] but they had no life of their own to
[53:38] support
[53:39] that action
[53:41] they had no power backing it
[53:44] it's like brother madam talks about that
[53:45] policeman
[53:47] who can step out into the street and
[53:49] dripping wet weighing 120 pounds or
[53:51] whatever it is
[53:53] the point was it's a very small
[53:55] individual
[53:56] but he can boldly step out in front of
[53:58] that vehicle
[54:00] put his whistle to his lips and blow
[54:04] and then direct traffic and expect them
[54:07] to obey
[54:08] boldly because he has an authority
[54:12] behind his life
[54:14] that gives him the power to do that
[54:17] but let me and you step out in the
[54:19] street
[54:20] is trying to start directing traffic
[54:23] and more than likely you're gonna end up
[54:24] hit you're end up in the hospital
[54:27] and it'll either be because the car hits
[54:29] you or the maniac in the car gets out
[54:31] and beats you to a bloody pulp
[54:35] because you have no
[54:36] authority you acted boldly but with no
[54:40] authority
[54:41] you have nothing behind the life
[54:44] to back up
[54:45] what you are trying to do
[54:47] and that's where these men stood and
[54:49] that evil spirit immediately recognized
[54:52] it and said
[54:53] paul jesus i know
[54:55] and paul i know
[54:57] but who are you
[54:59] you are nobody
[55:01] you see because as long as you're
[55:03] playing games
[55:05] you might be able to intimidate someone
[55:07] smaller than you
[55:08] you might be able to intimidate someone
[55:10] who doesn't know better
[55:12] but you run into somebody who knows who
[55:14] they are in their position
[55:17] and if you don't have the proper
[55:18] authority you will not stand in their
[55:20] way
[55:21] and demonic power knows where they stand
[55:24] and what their position is
[55:26] and they don't stand down for someone
[55:29] who does not have that authority to
[55:31] command them
[55:33] so you be careful
[55:36] and know where you stand
[55:38] because this is no game
[55:42] okay
[55:42] so that's the new testament we want to
[55:44] know is this something that goes
[55:46] throughout the scripture
[55:48] and actually there's almost an identical
[55:50] story
[55:53] in the old testament
[55:55] in the book of samuel
[55:57] hofner and phineas
[55:59] if the name
[56:00] names don't ring a bell for you they
[56:02] were the sons of eli the high priest
[56:06] part of the ministry
[56:09] now
[56:11] israel had been given
[56:13] the land of promise
[56:14] and they were given promises
[56:17] that the land was theirs
[56:19] but it was based
[56:20] on their life
[56:22] and how they were serving god
[56:25] and during this time they had gone into
[56:27] a
[56:28] place of apostasy had fallen away
[56:32] and they weren't living correctly they
[56:33] were just coming out of this time of
[56:35] judges and entering into the kings
[56:38] and
[56:40] up to this time
[56:43] one after another the priesthood becomes
[56:46] so corrupt
[56:48] that we know that these sons of eli
[56:51] were demanding things and using their
[56:53] position as a way to enrich themselves
[56:57] and their own position
[56:58] sounds similar to the sons of siva
[57:02] they use it to wield power over the
[57:04] people
[57:07] not to actually be a blessing to the
[57:09] people you see these are
[57:11] wolves in sheep's clothing
[57:13] they go through and they're fleecing the
[57:14] sheep and not feeding them
[57:17] but what they find out is when they
[57:19] actually have to come and meet
[57:24] [Music]
[57:25] the devil on the ground
[57:27] of authority they have nowhere to stand
[57:31] to the sons of of eli hofney and phineas
[57:36] they
[57:37] the children of israel are going to war
[57:39] with the philistines who were oppressing
[57:41] them
[57:42] and you would think children of god
[57:44] being oppressed
[57:45] they have a right to fight for what's
[57:47] theirs the promised land
[57:51] and that follows forward to today if you
[57:54] stand on god's word
[57:58] you have a right to fight for what's
[58:00] yours what your promise is in the book
[58:05] but make sure
[58:06] you're standing where you should on the
[58:09] word
[58:10] so if you're not standing on the word
[58:12] you don't have a foundation to stand on
[58:14] if you don't have a foundation to stand
[58:16] on
[58:17] rocky ground gravelly rocky ground is
[58:19] never a good place to fight from
[58:23] if the ground under your feet is loose
[58:28] they may the enemy may not even need to
[58:30] knock you down
[58:31] you may go down on your own
[58:35] if your foundation is no good
[58:37] it don't matter what is on top of a
[58:39] faulty foundation it could be all the
[58:41] best products in the world
[58:43] when the foundation goes out the rest of
[58:45] the building follows
[58:47] know where you stand
[58:51] and here they are
[58:54] they're going to war
[58:56] with the philistines they'd have no
[58:57] profit they had no real leader and the
[59:00] other light said i know what we'll do
[59:02] often in finnish said we i know what
[59:04] we'll do
[59:05] we'll go get the ark
[59:07] of the covenant
[59:09] the
[59:11] the symbol of god's very own presence
[59:15] the
[59:16] symbol of god's promises
[59:20] to our people
[59:22] and we'll take it before the armies of
[59:24] israel
[59:25] and there's no way
[59:27] that the enemies of god
[59:28] can stand against
[59:30] that and they were right
[59:35] but because they were out of their
[59:36] position
[59:39] it didn't do them any good
[59:41] you know and the whole place
[59:43] under this false ministry this false
[59:45] anointing got really excited because
[59:48] when they brought the ark when the ark
[59:50] of the covenant of the lord came into
[59:51] the camp here it is these ministers
[59:53] they're carrying the ark of the covenant
[59:55] into the camp
[59:58] all israel the entire church
[1:00:01] shouted with a great shout so that the
[1:00:04] earth rang out
[1:00:06] and i'm not going to read through but if
[1:00:07] you
[1:00:08] read it it said that it even affected
[1:00:11] the philistines momentarily
[1:00:13] the shout the what appeared to be such a
[1:00:15] great revival affected the enemy for a
[1:00:18] minute
[1:00:19] until they realized wait a minute
[1:00:22] it's all shouting there's no power
[1:00:26] there and you just go a few verses down
[1:00:30] and the philistines fought and israel
[1:00:33] was smitten and they fled every man into
[1:00:36] his tent
[1:00:37] and there was a very great slaughter
[1:00:40] for their fell of israel thirty thousand
[1:00:43] foot men
[1:00:45] and the ark of god was taken
[1:00:48] and the two sons of eli
[1:00:50] hofney and phineas were slain
[1:00:55] you see
[1:00:56] you can carry a message book you can
[1:00:58] quote the message you can quote the
[1:01:00] scripture
[1:01:01] but if you don't have a life backing it
[1:01:03] up
[1:01:05] if you're not actually living a life
[1:01:08] worthy of the gospel
[1:01:10] i say run to christ
[1:01:14] run to christ
[1:01:17] because he is looking for a repentant
[1:01:19] heart
[1:01:21] the minute you can get back to the rock
[1:01:24] and fall upon the rock even though you
[1:01:25] may be broken
[1:01:27] yet you won't be crushed
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:32] you see
[1:01:34] so we see in these two instances there
[1:01:36] was no life to support the claim of
[1:01:39] boldness
[1:01:42] there was nothing there
[1:01:44] you know we see that a lot today
[1:01:47] we see that a lot today
[1:01:51] you know and don't take this the wrong
[1:01:52] way i'm not knocking you if if this is
[1:01:55] your thing but everyone is is a
[1:01:57] christian on social media
[1:01:59] everyone is a christian that you meet on
[1:02:01] the street
[1:02:03] everyone you know
[1:02:05] post this if you love if you love jesus
[1:02:07] and if or if you don't just don't
[1:02:10] it's like
[1:02:12] how does that prove anything right
[1:02:15] you know or
[1:02:16] or this or that and everyone's out there
[1:02:19] and you know if if that mean
[1:02:22] is edifying to you i'm not taking that
[1:02:24] away from you
[1:02:25] what i'm saying is
[1:02:27] there should be such a life expressed
[1:02:32] in boldness
[1:02:34] you see boldness
[1:02:36] a boldness of expression is not just
[1:02:39] verbally
[1:02:41] in fact the most bold expressions are
[1:02:44] usually seen visually
[1:02:48] if somebody was to walk through these
[1:02:50] doors
[1:02:51] in a bright neon suit of some kind right
[1:02:53] now half of the church would turn around
[1:02:58] everyone would remember that person
[1:03:02] and that's even how in marketing and in
[1:03:05] advertising they look for something that
[1:03:07] flashes and catches the attention they
[1:03:09] look for something that sticks in the
[1:03:11] mind
[1:03:12] and draws you back to the message
[1:03:15] you see
[1:03:16] and we are to be the salt of the earth
[1:03:19] not a flash before the people but you
[1:03:22] are to be such an attraction
[1:03:25] that you would draw them to that message
[1:03:28] you see because they've heard plenty of
[1:03:29] messages
[1:03:31] everyone has a message today and
[1:03:33] everyone's trying to share it and
[1:03:34] everyone's trying to prove that they're
[1:03:36] right
[1:03:38] but live such a bold life in christ
[1:03:42] that they want to know the message that
[1:03:44] has created that boldness
[1:03:48] amen because guess what
[1:03:50] now
[1:03:51] due to that attraction they'll be
[1:03:53] willing to listen to your message
[1:03:56] but if not there's just so
[1:03:58] many messages
[1:04:00] that everyone has become tone deaf
[1:04:06] that's that's so true
[1:04:08] i don't know how many of you have spent
[1:04:09] a lot of time in the wilderness
[1:04:12] out in the forests or the the prairies
[1:04:15] or the grasslands or wherever it might
[1:04:17] be somewhere where it's just the sounds
[1:04:20] of nature and quiet
[1:04:22] out in the jungle somewhere
[1:04:24] you sit down and you listen
[1:04:26] and at first if you come from somewhere
[1:04:28] that's really loud and busy
[1:04:30] and you sit there
[1:04:32] it's almost daunting
[1:04:34] it's so quiet
[1:04:37] but you stay there for a week
[1:04:39] two weeks a month
[1:04:42] and you be will become so in tune to
[1:04:44] every little sound
[1:04:46] that's there
[1:04:49] you'll hear it
[1:04:50] you'll recognize it you'll know is that
[1:04:52] normal is that not normal
[1:04:55] but here in in the city
[1:04:57] in the metropolis there is so
[1:05:00] much noise
[1:05:02] that your brain automatically just
[1:05:04] begins to tune things out
[1:05:06] tune things out tune things out
[1:05:09] and that's where the world both
[1:05:12] church and and
[1:05:14] nominal is at today is there's been so
[1:05:17] much noise
[1:05:19] they have just tuned it out and they're
[1:05:22] just sailing on through life
[1:05:24] they don't even hear the sirens behind
[1:05:27] them until they're on top of them
[1:05:31] the warning
[1:05:32] something's wrong something's wrong
[1:05:35] they become so tone deaf
[1:05:39] but may there be something about your
[1:05:41] life
[1:05:42] that causes an attraction that'll cause
[1:05:45] them to stop for a moment
[1:05:48] and ask you about your message
[1:05:50] you see because if you've been to the
[1:05:52] mall or you've been walking down the
[1:05:54] street and you hear
[1:05:56] i know for me um working in the
[1:05:58] hospitals there's always overhead
[1:05:59] messages
[1:06:00] over and over again
[1:06:02] and you learn which ones you should pay
[1:06:04] attention to and which ones you tune out
[1:06:06] and just like nothing's happening
[1:06:11] but if i walk up to somebody and i say
[1:06:15] what is it what does this mean
[1:06:18] now they can know
[1:06:20] that i'm focused in and i have a desire
[1:06:23] to understand what that message is
[1:06:27] so it's got to be something to attract
[1:06:29] and draw me in
[1:06:30] and that's what our lives should be
[1:06:33] all right we're gonna keep moving
[1:06:37] now we saw two
[1:06:38] examples of
[1:06:40] individuals
[1:06:43] who were brash and look to be bold and
[1:06:46] even look to be bold for the right
[1:06:47] reasons
[1:06:49] one was trying to cast a devil out of
[1:06:51] somebody
[1:06:52] that's a good thing right
[1:06:55] the other ones were trying to deliver
[1:06:56] god's people from an oppressor
[1:06:59] good thing right
[1:07:00] these are not bad reasons
[1:07:05] okay
[1:07:06] in daniel chapter three
[1:07:08] you'll read the story of shadrach
[1:07:10] meshach and abednego
[1:07:12] okay
[1:07:13] this is not
[1:07:16] something new this is something we all
[1:07:17] know this is a common story if you've
[1:07:19] been to sunday school you know the story
[1:07:21] of the three hebrew children
[1:07:24] now they were bold
[1:07:27] they were extremely bold
[1:07:28] but you know they were extremely humble
[1:07:30] as well
[1:07:31] you'll see you'll see a reoccurring
[1:07:34] theme
[1:07:35] in all the children of god
[1:07:37] in the midst of knowing where they stand
[1:07:39] and standing boldly yet you'll see a
[1:07:42] humbleness through their life
[1:07:45] and those that don't have that life of
[1:07:47] christ inside
[1:07:48] their boldness is just brash
[1:07:51] and and and will push
[1:07:52] everybody else out of their way to get
[1:07:54] what they're looking for okay
[1:07:57] now shadrach meshach and abednego the
[1:08:00] king had created this great statue now
[1:08:03] if you know the message
[1:08:04] brother branham says that great statue
[1:08:06] was of daniel the prophet
[1:08:11] so they were more or less in a church
[1:08:12] service
[1:08:15] but they were so in tune with the word
[1:08:20] they were paying attention
[1:08:23] and even though the authorities that be
[1:08:26] said this is how the service is going to
[1:08:27] go they said that's not right
[1:08:30] that's not right
[1:08:32] it's not daniel that's wrong
[1:08:35] it's not the prophet that's wrong
[1:08:37] but it's the worshipping of the prophet
[1:08:38] that's wrong
[1:08:41] okay
[1:08:42] now you find out
[1:08:44] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:08:46] and forever and the devil's never come
[1:08:48] up with a new trick
[1:08:50] that's why if you'll just get in tune
[1:08:53] and get into the word you can know every
[1:08:56] trick he has
[1:08:58] and how to meet it
[1:08:59] because god has defeated him over and
[1:09:02] over and over and then you can stand
[1:09:05] boldly
[1:09:07] when you see the devil coming in like a
[1:09:08] flood
[1:09:09] he said i would raise up a standard
[1:09:12] and a standard is something that stands
[1:09:13] against whatever is coming in
[1:09:16] and you are to be that standard that he
[1:09:18] raises up
[1:09:20] an embodiment of jesus christ in this
[1:09:23] age to stand against that flood of the
[1:09:26] enemy
[1:09:27] but how will you stand boldly as a
[1:09:29] standard
[1:09:32] if you can't recognize when you're
[1:09:33] supposed to stand or where you're
[1:09:35] supposed to stand
[1:09:37] you have to be in the word go back into
[1:09:39] the scripture what i mean is
[1:09:41] open up this bible and begin reading
[1:09:44] and say lord just show me one new thing
[1:09:47] today
[1:09:48] you won't it doesn't mean all of a
[1:09:50] sudden you'll know everything
[1:09:52] but lord just show me one new thing
[1:09:55] today
[1:09:57] you might read
[1:09:58] the same verse you read yesterday
[1:10:01] and if you're
[1:10:03] humbled yourself
[1:10:05] coming before him coming before the
[1:10:07] throne of grace boldly
[1:10:09] and saying lord just reveal yourself to
[1:10:11] me in this one little verse
[1:10:14] and he'll give you out of that verse
[1:10:16] that you read
[1:10:17] of that portion you read
[1:10:20] the right standard to stand boldly
[1:10:23] against the flood for the day
[1:10:25] maybe not the flood for tomorrow
[1:10:28] but for what you're going to meet that
[1:10:29] day
[1:10:30] he'll give you what you need
[1:10:32] and then you can stand boldly before the
[1:10:34] enemy
[1:10:37] shadrach meshach and abednego i think
[1:10:39] it's so
[1:10:40] beautiful what they said to the king
[1:10:43] okay
[1:10:46] they answered and said to the king o
[1:10:48] nebuchadnezzar
[1:10:50] we are not careful
[1:10:52] to answer thee in this matter
[1:11:00] they're telling him we don't have to
[1:11:02] hesitate
[1:11:04] about where we stand
[1:11:06] we're not worried
[1:11:08] about the end result
[1:11:10] of where we stand and what we believe
[1:11:15] we're not searching for words we're not
[1:11:17] trying to be politically correct
[1:11:20] we're going to answer you straight
[1:11:25] if it be so
[1:11:27] speaking of he said
[1:11:29] he would cast them into that fiery
[1:11:31] furnace
[1:11:33] they said if it be so
[1:11:35] our god whom we serve
[1:11:38] is able to deliver us bold
[1:11:41] they knew where they stood on the word
[1:11:43] and they knew god's power to deliver
[1:11:47] you see but that's not
[1:11:50] just their only source of boldness
[1:11:53] okay
[1:11:57] able to deliver us from the burning
[1:11:58] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[1:12:02] of thine hand o king
[1:12:04] you see they ended with o king
[1:12:07] they still giving proper respect to the
[1:12:09] authority
[1:12:12] you see that
[1:12:14] they're not attacking nobody they're not
[1:12:17] trying to tear nobody down they're not
[1:12:18] trying to while you don't even deserve
[1:12:20] to be king
[1:12:21] daniel with all the things daniel has
[1:12:23] shown you and prophesied to you and you
[1:12:25] know we know daniel and how dare you
[1:12:28] treat us like this
[1:12:29] i said no king
[1:12:30] this is
[1:12:32] this is what you're going to do then
[1:12:34] you have all every right
[1:12:36] we just cannot do what you're asking us
[1:12:38] out of a good faith and good conscious
[1:12:41] towards christ
[1:12:43] we can't do it
[1:12:45] so even under the threats
[1:12:48] of being put in this fiery furnace we
[1:12:50] still can't
[1:12:53] but if not if not what if god does not
[1:12:56] deliver us
[1:12:57] from this fiery furnace
[1:13:00] be it known unto thee
[1:13:02] o king that we will not serve thy gods
[1:13:06] nor worship the golden image which thou
[1:13:10] has set up
[1:13:14] and we know the end of the story
[1:13:16] we know that god came and delivered them
[1:13:19] but they stood on god's word no matter
[1:13:21] what the consequence
[1:13:23] and they let the king know
[1:13:25] our god if he so desires he can deliver
[1:13:28] us from this
[1:13:29] and from you he's greater than all this
[1:13:32] but even if he chooses not to
[1:13:35] yet will still stand
[1:13:37] because we know what we are standing on
[1:13:39] is right we know that what we're
[1:13:40] standing on is true
[1:13:42] and that'll take a great revelation and
[1:13:45] know
[1:13:46] that what you're believing in is true
[1:13:50] you can claim you know you believe
[1:13:52] something and that you believe it's true
[1:13:54] but let yourself be put in a position
[1:13:56] like this
[1:13:58] where your stand on what you believe is
[1:14:00] true
[1:14:01] could cost you your life
[1:14:03] that's a whole other thing
[1:14:06] there's many people that say yeah i
[1:14:07] believe this and i believe that there's
[1:14:09] many people say i believe the message i
[1:14:11] just can't live it
[1:14:14] well that tells me you have a
[1:14:17] understanding on knowledge of the
[1:14:19] message
[1:14:21] and you can see that by that
[1:14:23] understanding i think what there's some
[1:14:25] truth to that
[1:14:27] but you don't actually believe
[1:14:31] because a true belief
[1:14:33] will have
[1:14:34] an altering effect on who you are
[1:14:37] it will change you from the inside out
[1:14:40] okay
[1:14:43] and actually yep
[1:14:44] now my next example
[1:14:48] in acts stephen
[1:14:51] he was a deacon i believe he was a
[1:14:53] deacon
[1:14:55] it says he was full of faith and power
[1:14:59] and did great wonders and miracles among
[1:15:01] the people
[1:15:02] then there arose certain of the
[1:15:03] synagogue which is called
[1:15:06] the synagogue of the libertines and the
[1:15:08] cyrene sir iranians and the alexandrians
[1:15:12] and of them cilicia and of asia
[1:15:15] disputing with stephen and they were not
[1:15:18] able to resist the wisdom and the spirit
[1:15:21] by which he spake
[1:15:24] he knew where he stood
[1:15:26] and he had such a boldness he believed
[1:15:29] what christ said
[1:15:30] which was take no thought
[1:15:33] to what you'll say when dragged before
[1:15:35] magistrates between before kings and
[1:15:38] powers that would be he said don't even
[1:15:40] take a thought
[1:15:42] he said i
[1:15:43] will place the very words that you will
[1:15:46] speak in your mouth
[1:15:49] and stephen took that to heart
[1:15:51] and as he began to testify
[1:15:54] of jesus christ before the people
[1:15:57] he has let that presence of god speak
[1:15:59] through him in such a way that the same
[1:16:02] people who came against christ
[1:16:04] found themselves facing the same exact
[1:16:08] jesus christ in stephen
[1:16:10] to where they were confounded at every
[1:16:12] turn
[1:16:14] stephen was bold
[1:16:16] there wasn't any place that he didn't
[1:16:19] dare to speak or stand up for this cause
[1:16:21] of christ
[1:16:23] all the way to the sanhedrin council he
[1:16:26] got dragged before
[1:16:27] and he preached the most fiery boldest
[1:16:30] message possible
[1:16:32] but you see steven's goal was not to
[1:16:35] raise himself up
[1:16:37] stephen's goal wasn't to make some big
[1:16:39] name for himself
[1:16:41] steven's goal was if he could save one
[1:16:43] person in that crowd
[1:16:45] it would be worth it no matter what the
[1:16:47] cost and that cost him his life
[1:16:52] because there was one
[1:16:54] that it affected
[1:16:56] but that one that affected still held
[1:16:58] the coats of those who helped stone him
[1:17:00] that day
[1:17:04] but stephen still stood boldly knowing
[1:17:07] where he stood
[1:17:09] without wavering
[1:17:12] you see
[1:17:13] steven actually had to take it to one
[1:17:15] step further
[1:17:17] and actually give his life
[1:17:20] and here he stood the same way as the
[1:17:22] hebrew children
[1:17:24] he knew the god that i serve can deliver
[1:17:26] me
[1:17:27] but even if he doesn't
[1:17:29] i still will stand for the truth
[1:17:32] and that had such an effect
[1:17:34] that saul
[1:17:37] of tarsus
[1:17:39] was affected in such a way
[1:17:41] that he became
[1:17:42] paul
[1:17:44] and became
[1:17:45] the apostle to the gentiles
[1:17:49] he became the one who wrote a majority
[1:17:51] of the new testament
[1:17:53] that we read even tonight
[1:17:56] you see
[1:17:57] because if you know where you stand then
[1:17:59] you know god has a purpose no matter
[1:18:01] what the outcome is for you
[1:18:05] look at william tyndale
[1:18:07] who all knows who william tyndale was
[1:18:11] okay if you don't know who william
[1:18:13] tyndale was
[1:18:14] he is the man
[1:18:16] who made it his job
[1:18:18] to translate the bible from latin into
[1:18:21] common english
[1:18:22] so that his goal was that the common
[1:18:25] plowboy could read the scripture
[1:18:29] and that cost him his life he was burned
[1:18:32] at the stake
[1:18:34] but the same king that allowed him to be
[1:18:36] burnt at the stake was so affected later
[1:18:39] that he is the one who orchestrated the
[1:18:41] translation and putting together of the
[1:18:43] bible in english the bible we all read
[1:18:46] today the king james version king james
[1:18:51] william tyndale was willing to stand
[1:18:53] boldly
[1:18:55] he didn't curse nobody
[1:18:59] in fact he prayed lord open the eyes of
[1:19:02] the king
[1:19:04] and his prayer was answered
[1:19:06] he would never live to see it but his
[1:19:08] prayer was answered and because of that
[1:19:11] is why all of us can hold this bible
[1:19:13] today
[1:19:14] and read it and understand it as the
[1:19:17] holy spirit would reveal it to us
[1:19:19] amen
[1:19:20] men who are willing to stand boldly no
[1:19:23] matter the cost
[1:19:26] now
[1:19:32] how do we stand boldly
[1:19:36] i just want to touch on a few things i
[1:19:37] already mentioned boldness isn't just in
[1:19:39] the words that we speak but i want to
[1:19:40] give you a scriptural
[1:19:43] reference here
[1:19:45] i want to give you just enough here
[1:19:47] tonight
[1:19:48] so you can take these scriptures
[1:19:50] it'll trigger something in you that
[1:19:51] you'll want to know a little bit more
[1:19:54] because if
[1:19:56] if all i do is give you something that
[1:19:58] sounds good
[1:19:59] something you enjoy right now
[1:20:02] but doesn't actually trigger you to have
[1:20:04] a desire to go and search for something
[1:20:06] more
[1:20:07] then it was all in vain
[1:20:09] yeah
[1:20:11] i've tickled your ears as scripture
[1:20:13] would say
[1:20:15] but we're not here to tickle your ears i
[1:20:17] want to give you just enough to be like
[1:20:19] huh wow i need to know more about that
[1:20:23] is what he's saying is it true
[1:20:25] is what he read is that true
[1:20:27] was that scripture read in the correct
[1:20:29] context
[1:20:31] was that quote quoted correctly
[1:20:35] because you owe it to yourself
[1:20:37] to know that
[1:20:39] you owe it to yourself if you don't
[1:20:40] already know that
[1:20:42] if it's not already resounding with you
[1:20:44] to go back into the scripture and begin
[1:20:46] searching from genesis to revelation and
[1:20:48] find out
[1:20:49] is that the truth
[1:20:51] because if you don't know for surety
[1:20:53] that it's the truth how will you stand
[1:20:54] boldly
[1:20:57] you won't
[1:20:59] you'll hit some point
[1:21:01] your knowledge will take you so far and
[1:21:04] you'll hit a point
[1:21:06] where there'll be a place you can't
[1:21:07] cross
[1:21:08] where you'll be caught in a state of
[1:21:10] doubt
[1:21:11] you'll be unsure
[1:21:13] do i know that do i not know that is it
[1:21:15] true
[1:21:17] well if you want to stand boldly
[1:21:20] go
[1:21:21] know it for yourself
[1:21:23] search it out ask god to reveal it to
[1:21:25] you
[1:21:26] in timothy 4
[1:21:28] verses 12 and 13
[1:21:31] paul is speaking to timothy
[1:21:33] and i love this verse
[1:21:35] i love this verse timothy and not for
[1:21:38] the reason i think that most people
[1:21:40] think
[1:21:41] and it says let no man despise thy youth
[1:21:44] but be thou an example of the believers
[1:21:48] in word in conversation in charity in
[1:21:51] spirit in faith in purity till i come
[1:21:55] give attendance to reading to
[1:21:57] exhortation to doctrine
[1:22:00] now
[1:22:00] i think a majority of people when they
[1:22:02] read this let no man despise our youth
[1:22:03] especially young people right we read
[1:22:05] things especially when we're a lot
[1:22:06] younger and we don't let them despise
[1:22:09] your youth well that means
[1:22:10] be bold and don't let nobody put you
[1:22:13] down and you know stand up for yourself
[1:22:16] don't let them despise you
[1:22:18] no no no calm down it's all right calm
[1:22:21] down that's not what it means you didn't
[1:22:24] read through the entire verse you got
[1:22:25] excited in the first few words because
[1:22:27] it said something that made you happy
[1:22:29] but that's not it
[1:22:31] you had to read through to understand
[1:22:32] what paul was telling him it says let no
[1:22:35] man despise thy youth
[1:22:37] but
[1:22:38] be thou an example of the believers
[1:22:41] what he's saying is live such a life
[1:22:45] reflection of the gospel that there will
[1:22:47] be nothing in your life to despise about
[1:22:50] you
[1:22:52] okay and we know that because it goes on
[1:22:55] and he explains all the areas where
[1:22:57] you're to be an example to the believers
[1:23:00] in order to live above reproach and not
[1:23:03] be despised because of your youth
[1:23:05] because
[1:23:06] we all whether you're
[1:23:09] 10 12 5 50 60 70 years old in this room
[1:23:13] today
[1:23:15] if you're a little bit older than the
[1:23:16] person below you you're kind of like oh
[1:23:18] great there they are all them young
[1:23:20] people oh them kids they're doing it
[1:23:22] again
[1:23:24] and you may not realize it but you're
[1:23:26] just kind of despising them
[1:23:29] because they're not living at your level
[1:23:33] right
[1:23:34] you know if you're 12 12 and the
[1:23:37] five-year-old's trying to hang out with
[1:23:38] you but they're messing up the the toys
[1:23:40] that you're playing with you're like get
[1:23:42] out of here leave me alone
[1:23:44] you despise them
[1:23:46] because they're not meeting the
[1:23:48] expectation
[1:23:51] okay
[1:23:52] and that's what paul is telling timothy
[1:23:54] he said look it because of your youth
[1:23:57] the elders and the group around you
[1:24:00] will have a tendency to despise you if
[1:24:02] you don't live this life worthy of the
[1:24:04] gospel
[1:24:06] and if you're not living a life worthy
[1:24:08] of the gospel and living a life that's
[1:24:10] an example before the saints
[1:24:13] they have a right
[1:24:16] you can't demand something of them that
[1:24:18] you're not actually producing yourself
[1:24:21] and here if you're going to be a young
[1:24:23] person and a leader
[1:24:25] which all of your young people are
[1:24:27] called to be leaders
[1:24:28] leaders in your home leaders at your
[1:24:30] school leaders at your work right now
[1:24:34] does that mean you're going to be a
[1:24:35] manager no
[1:24:37] it means that you are to lead an example
[1:24:40] of a christ-like life before the people
[1:24:43] so that they can follow christ
[1:24:46] not so they can follow you as a manager
[1:24:48] of the company or the ceo
[1:24:50] that will do them no good eternally
[1:24:53] like you could teach someone how to be a
[1:24:55] millionaire a billionaire
[1:24:58] but their end is the same
[1:25:01] six feet of dirt in a box
[1:25:05] that's all in vain
[1:25:07] but you are to lead them to christ
[1:25:10] through a bold life live for him
[1:25:14] okay
[1:25:17] so now we know
[1:25:19] how are we going to live boldly by
[1:25:21] living a life that's an example
[1:25:23] before the people
[1:25:25] okay now in peter chapter three i just
[1:25:28] want to follow it up this was to the
[1:25:29] young people this was to a youth but
[1:25:31] it's to everybody
[1:25:33] right
[1:25:35] i think was it rather one
[1:25:37] i want to say it was brother one but i
[1:25:39] may be misquoting i maybe have the wrong
[1:25:41] minister and i just remember the service
[1:25:43] um who said age is just a number
[1:25:46] eternally we're we're all 18. so we're
[1:25:49] all youth so this this is applicable to
[1:25:51] all of us
[1:25:53] even if you're five
[1:25:55] eternally you're eighteen so it still
[1:25:57] applies to you
[1:25:59] uh first peter chapter three fifteen and
[1:26:01] sixteen but sanctify the lord god in
[1:26:04] your hearts and be ready always to give
[1:26:07] an answer to every man that asketh you a
[1:26:10] reason of the hope that is in you with
[1:26:13] meekness and fear
[1:26:16] with meekness and fear
[1:26:18] so how should you speak to them through
[1:26:20] meekness and fear and fear is a respect
[1:26:26] having a good conscience
[1:26:29] that whereas they speak evil of you
[1:26:32] as of evildoers they may be ashamed that
[1:26:36] falsely accuse
[1:26:38] your good conversation and christ now
[1:26:40] that word conversation most of us when
[1:26:43] we hear the word conversation we think
[1:26:44] of two people's talking to each other
[1:26:48] but if you take it back to the original
[1:26:49] greek translation the meaning of
[1:26:52] conversation here is actually your
[1:26:54] manner of life conduct behave or
[1:26:57] behavior
[1:27:00] and
[1:27:01] you'll find that conversation was
[1:27:03] translated that way in many places in
[1:27:04] the scripture so what peter is saying
[1:27:10] is having a conscience that whereas they
[1:27:12] speak evil of you as of evildoers that
[1:27:15] they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
[1:27:17] you
[1:27:19] through your
[1:27:20] manner of life or conduct or behavior in
[1:27:23] christ
[1:27:24] that same thing that paul was telling
[1:27:26] timothy let your yet be
[1:27:28] above
[1:27:30] the being despised by others by the life
[1:27:34] that you live
[1:27:36] and peter is reverberating the same
[1:27:38] thing
[1:27:39] he's saying live a life so worthy of the
[1:27:41] gospel
[1:27:42] that those who would come against you
[1:27:44] would be even like the ministry that
[1:27:46] came against brother branham and said oh
[1:27:48] he's false doctrine he's off on the word
[1:27:51] but we never met somebody with such a
[1:27:52] christ-like
[1:27:54] character
[1:27:56] well how can how does that jive
[1:27:59] how can someone have a more a greater
[1:28:02] more christ-like character than anyone
[1:28:04] you've ever met before
[1:28:07] but
[1:28:09] they're not
[1:28:11] following christ
[1:28:13] because to say that someone was off the
[1:28:15] word
[1:28:16] is to say they are not following christ
[1:28:18] because he is the word
[1:28:22] so we have to be living that life that
[1:28:24] is such an example that they go
[1:28:27] i don't understand why you believe what
[1:28:29] you believe
[1:28:31] but there is there's anyone i've ever
[1:28:33] met
[1:28:34] that i would want to be like
[1:28:36] it would be you
[1:28:39] because you're such a reflection of
[1:28:40] christ that they can't help but notice
[1:28:44] they can't help but see
[1:28:46] and feel that very presence of christ
[1:28:48] in europe when they step in close to you
[1:28:52] because you create continue to create
[1:28:53] that atmosphere and you stand boldly on
[1:28:56] the word in such a way
[1:28:58] that jesus christ
[1:29:00] the holy spirit
[1:29:02] is there
[1:29:03] crea
[1:29:04] creating such a presence
[1:29:06] because you are in conversation with him
[1:29:10] you are walking with him that's where we
[1:29:13] are going back to is
[1:29:15] the point where enoch
[1:29:18] walked boldly with the lord every day
[1:29:22] every day he knew he was going to go and
[1:29:24] walk with the lord
[1:29:26] he didn't falter there he didn't go well
[1:29:28] i don't know maybe
[1:29:30] maybe i'm not up to par today and i'll
[1:29:32] just kind of
[1:29:33] go and see what happens
[1:29:36] every day he had such a relationship
[1:29:39] and such a oneness such a closeness he'd
[1:29:41] just say
[1:29:42] honey
[1:29:43] i'm going out i'm gonna go walk with the
[1:29:45] lord for a while here i'll be back after
[1:29:47] a while
[1:29:48] and out he would go
[1:29:49] no doubt
[1:29:51] he had no doubt when he walked out the
[1:29:53] door that he was going to be walking as
[1:29:56] adam did in the garden
[1:29:58] with god there walking next to him and
[1:30:00] they'd be talking and conversating the
[1:30:02] whole way
[1:30:04] and that's where you need to come to
[1:30:07] that's where we're working towards well
[1:30:09] we may not be there yet
[1:30:11] but every day a little bit closer a
[1:30:13] little bit closer a little bit closer
[1:30:16] why because if you want to stand boldly
[1:30:18] you have to be in his presence because
[1:30:20] if you're not in his presence how will
[1:30:22] he give you the words to say
[1:30:27] you see because the exact scripture let
[1:30:29] me read them to you i thought both of
[1:30:30] them were unique
[1:30:31] and i'm trying to be aware of time here
[1:30:35] and not hold you long but i'm
[1:30:37] developing a bad record
[1:30:39] um
[1:30:40] matthew chapter 10
[1:30:43] in two points in in in the gospels
[1:30:45] matthew and luke and i want to just read
[1:30:46] both of them i'll just read quickly
[1:30:48] but beware of men for they will deliver
[1:30:50] you up to the councils and they will
[1:30:52] scourge you in their synagogues and ye
[1:30:54] shall be brought before governors and
[1:30:57] kings for my sake for a testimony
[1:30:59] against them and the gentiles
[1:31:02] but when they deliver you up take no
[1:31:04] thought how or what ye shall speak
[1:31:10] now that's a reassurance
[1:31:12] to know that he'll give you the not you
[1:31:14] don't have to worry about the thing to
[1:31:15] speak
[1:31:16] and it's also a reassurance
[1:31:19] knowing that i won't say the wrong thing
[1:31:22] so the minute you start putting your own
[1:31:24] thoughts into it trying to figure out
[1:31:25] what to say you're probably going to
[1:31:26] wreck it
[1:31:28] that's even that outside of spiritual
[1:31:30] things that happens to us on a daily
[1:31:32] basis
[1:31:34] it's like we we we think we got to
[1:31:36] figure it out and you go to talk to your
[1:31:38] brother or your sister or your mom or
[1:31:40] your wife or whoever it is and you say
[1:31:42] this what you think was this eloquent
[1:31:44] thing that you thought up and you find
[1:31:46] out it wasn't so eloquent
[1:31:48] you know
[1:31:50] so even if in natural things on things
[1:31:52] that we think we got our hands around
[1:31:54] we don't always do so well how much more
[1:31:57] spiritual things
[1:31:58] and how much more of an assurance do we
[1:32:00] need to know that when we open our mouth
[1:32:04] that he'll be the one speaking and we
[1:32:07] don't even have to worry about the words
[1:32:08] that are exiting
[1:32:10] okay
[1:32:12] take no thought how or what ye shall
[1:32:14] speak for shall be given you in the same
[1:32:17] hour what ye shall speak
[1:32:21] for is not ye that speak but the spirit
[1:32:24] of your father which speaketh in you
[1:32:28] all right luke 12 and
[1:32:31] when they bring you unto the synagogues
[1:32:34] and unto magistrates and powers
[1:32:37] taking no thought
[1:32:39] how or what thing ye shall answer
[1:32:43] or what ye shall say
[1:32:45] for the holy ghost shall teach you
[1:32:47] in the same hour
[1:32:49] what he ought to say
[1:32:57] but how are you going to do that how are
[1:32:59] you going to stand boldly
[1:33:01] expecting that to happen
[1:33:04] if you're not creating an atmosphere
[1:33:06] where he can come by
[1:33:09] now
[1:33:10] how do we attract him to come by
[1:33:18] we know scripture says
[1:33:21] call on his name
[1:33:24] you know brother branham talks about it
[1:33:26] and says if you'll just start talking
[1:33:28] about him he'll come on by
[1:33:33] well what's the likelihood that we will
[1:33:35] call on his name or talk about him
[1:33:38] if we're not spending time here
[1:33:43] we normally we
[1:33:45] call on the people that we talk to the
[1:33:47] most
[1:33:49] and we talk about the things
[1:33:51] that we pay attention to the most
[1:33:54] and if this is not
[1:33:56] if we don't speak to him that often
[1:34:00] and he's not at the top of your friends
[1:34:01] list
[1:34:04] right
[1:34:05] everyone who's got social media you all
[1:34:07] got a friends list or uh some type of
[1:34:10] association list
[1:34:12] and the you know that
[1:34:14] you know within those programs there's
[1:34:16] algorithms that the people that you look
[1:34:19] at their stuff the most and they look at
[1:34:20] your stuff the most the algorithm will
[1:34:23] automatically
[1:34:24] bring their stuff up for you to see
[1:34:26] first
[1:34:27] do you know that
[1:34:28] right
[1:34:30] you know your brain does the same thing
[1:34:36] who are the people that you think about
[1:34:37] the most
[1:34:38] even if those people are problematic
[1:34:43] and are causing you
[1:34:44] issues it's going to be those that
[1:34:47] you're interacting with the most
[1:34:50] there could be someone really lovely a
[1:34:52] best friend from 30 years ago but you
[1:34:54] haven't talked to them in 15 years
[1:34:56] you might think about them once a year
[1:34:58] twice a year but the person who's the
[1:35:01] thorn in the side
[1:35:02] or the person that is bothering you at
[1:35:04] work you're thinking about them like
[1:35:07] probably several times an hour
[1:35:12] so i say what type of relationship
[1:35:15] are we building with him
[1:35:16] that in a time of trouble we could call
[1:35:18] on his name
[1:35:21] that we'd even remember to call on his
[1:35:22] name
[1:35:23] that we'd be of the sentence and the
[1:35:26] presence of mind to remember
[1:35:29] oh well what do i do in this situation
[1:35:32] call on jesus
[1:35:35] is that our first reaction
[1:35:38] because until you call him he's not
[1:35:40] going to show up
[1:35:44] and you can't stand boldly until he gets
[1:35:46] there
[1:35:52] and you won't talk about him to other
[1:35:53] people
[1:35:54] outside is if you've been reading about
[1:35:56] him
[1:35:58] outside of you've been listening to
[1:35:59] things about him
[1:36:01] it's like the love story right
[1:36:05] how many of you know someone who's
[1:36:07] in love
[1:36:08] with a they got a significant other
[1:36:12] boyfriend girlfriend
[1:36:15] lives close or far away
[1:36:17] how hard is it for you to get them to
[1:36:19] talk about that individual
[1:36:25] not that hard
[1:36:26] even if they act coy about it like
[1:36:28] there's some people like
[1:36:30] you know
[1:36:32] but but you see that like the minute you
[1:36:34] mention it they they start smiling and
[1:36:36] lighting up like they're they're playing
[1:36:38] the game that's the young people's game
[1:36:40] of we're not we're not we're just
[1:36:42] friends
[1:36:45] sure
[1:36:46] sure we've all been friends before
[1:36:49] and those of us who have been friends
[1:36:50] before know what happens with just
[1:36:53] friends
[1:36:55] but we can tell
[1:36:57] by your reaction to mentioning that just
[1:37:00] friend
[1:37:01] on what kind of friend that is
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:05] and so should be with us
[1:37:07] is what kind of reaction does that stir
[1:37:09] when someone mentions the name of jesus
[1:37:12] when someone calls on him
[1:37:14] is it like uh okay we have to do this
[1:37:18] yeah i know a few things about him
[1:37:22] i can make it through this conversation
[1:37:23] because i have a general knowledge like
[1:37:26] you know
[1:37:27] i'll make it or is it yeah i know him
[1:37:29] too
[1:37:32] in fact the other day we were doing this
[1:37:33] and the other day we were doing that
[1:37:35] well guess what
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:37] he's of the type of the minute you start
[1:37:39] talking about him
[1:37:40] even if you're in the middle of a trial
[1:37:42] like the two men on the way to emmaus
[1:37:46] you know they were not like super joyful
[1:37:48] they were in the midst of the dumps
[1:37:51] but they were talking about jesus
[1:37:54] and guess what he showed up
[1:37:57] they didn't recognize it for most of the
[1:37:59] day
[1:37:59] but they were talking to him anyway
[1:38:06] stand boldly
[1:38:08] get ready to stand boldly
[1:38:10] on the word
[1:38:12] all right all right
[1:38:14] i gotta wrap this up let's see here
[1:38:18] yeah
[1:38:20] let me just read you one quote and we'll
[1:38:22] we'll close it up
[1:38:24] all right
[1:38:48] ah yeah let's read this one
[1:38:52] this is like when you when you bring too
[1:38:55] many have you ever been on a trip and
[1:38:57] you bring too many items with you on
[1:38:58] your trip and you got to figure out
[1:38:59] which one you're going to use since you
[1:39:01] bought it for the trip
[1:39:02] all right
[1:39:03] here you him 1957. i don't know if they
[1:39:06] they have that up there or not
[1:39:08] uh paragraph 37.
[1:39:11] i'm just going to read the whole thing
[1:39:12] and then we'll just close close it up i
[1:39:14] i believe the message has gone across
[1:39:17] it says
[1:39:18] well let's start at the top
[1:39:21] actually let's start
[1:39:26] about midway down
[1:39:27] on there i put
[1:39:29] let's see here
[1:39:32] where it says
[1:39:34] what we need is the love of god
[1:39:37] i give them a minute there so i don't
[1:39:39] get ahead of them
[1:39:41] um what we need is the love of god what
[1:39:43] we need tonight is men and women who
[1:39:45] will take a bold stand from the depths
[1:39:48] of their heart and serve the lord jesus
[1:39:51] the world's looking today not for a new
[1:39:54] denomination
[1:39:56] if i'd have started 10 years ago when i
[1:39:58] was
[1:39:59] in here i'd probably have been the
[1:40:00] father over a great denomination sure
[1:40:03] it would have been
[1:40:05] when
[1:40:06] men came to my house and said brother
[1:40:08] branham oh you got it in your hand do
[1:40:10] this no
[1:40:12] there was somebody spoke to me above and
[1:40:14] i heard him
[1:40:16] i don't want to start denominations we
[1:40:18] got enough
[1:40:20] we have enough self-exalted men
[1:40:23] we have enough people who use their
[1:40:25] boldness to exalt themselves
[1:40:34] what i want to do is be a servant of him
[1:40:37] love him and obey him and serve him well
[1:40:41] the bible said you are the salt of the
[1:40:44] earth you see salt is a bold flavor
[1:40:47] if you put salt in anything even in a
[1:40:49] small amount you'll know it's there
[1:40:52] or if you ever eat something that's
[1:40:53] supposed to have a little bit of salt
[1:40:55] and it didn't get added you'll know it's
[1:40:57] not there
[1:40:58] so he's saying be that type of bold
[1:41:02] be the bold in the workplace or in at
[1:41:04] school or wherever you're at or amongst
[1:41:06] your family
[1:41:08] so that when you're there
[1:41:10] they know it
[1:41:13] when you're not there they also know it
[1:41:17] okay
[1:41:18] today you can call yourself a
[1:41:20] presbyterian that don't mean a thing in
[1:41:22] the presence of god you can call
[1:41:24] yourself a pentecostal that doesn't mean
[1:41:26] a thing in the presence of god today you
[1:41:28] can call yourself a message believer
[1:41:30] you can say i believe a prophet
[1:41:33] i don't
[1:41:34] bring you any closer to god into the
[1:41:35] presence of god
[1:41:37] that doesn't mean a thing in the
[1:41:39] presence of god
[1:41:40] not one thing
[1:41:42] what he wants to see
[1:41:44] is a man or woman that's a christian in
[1:41:47] their heart
[1:41:48] that's what the world wants to see
[1:41:52] you see
[1:41:53] church has gone denomination has gone
[1:41:55] the opposite direction
[1:41:56] and they think well how do we how do we
[1:42:00] increase our numbers and bring in the
[1:42:01] world and save more people i know
[1:42:04] let's be more like the world so they'll
[1:42:06] be more attracted to be a part of us
[1:42:09] and the world that first saw that
[1:42:11] and it was enticing and they came in
[1:42:14] just like rome and niaceya rome where
[1:42:17] they said you know what we'll do is
[1:42:19] we'll use all these pagan holidays
[1:42:22] and we'll now give them a christian name
[1:42:25] the pagans will know they're still their
[1:42:27] holidays but the christians will accept
[1:42:29] them with those names and we'll all be
[1:42:31] one big happy group
[1:42:33] that attracted them in
[1:42:35] but brother branham in the message you
[1:42:36] many times he uses that term he said
[1:42:39] he said
[1:42:42] there's a song actually and the song is
[1:42:43] the one he's quoting he says we let down
[1:42:45] the bars we let down the bars
[1:42:47] the sheep got out
[1:42:49] how did the goats get in
[1:42:52] and that's where they found themselves
[1:42:54] is they let down the bars they let down
[1:42:56] the bars and now
[1:42:58] they can't tell the difference between
[1:42:59] the congregation and the congregation
[1:43:01] that's out
[1:43:03] and the world can do the same thing
[1:43:05] the world looks at it and goes
[1:43:08] me and you we look the same we act the
[1:43:10] same
[1:43:11] i already belonged to enough clubs and
[1:43:13] places to go i don't need one more for
[1:43:15] sunday and wednesday thank you much
[1:43:19] you see and that's where brethren said
[1:43:20] that is what the world wants to see if
[1:43:24] you'll stand boldly on what you believe
[1:43:26] humbly
[1:43:28] the world is impressed by that
[1:43:31] they may never see what you see
[1:43:33] but they will recognize that there's
[1:43:35] something to it
[1:43:37] there's something to what you say and
[1:43:39] what you believe
[1:43:41] i may not be able to accept it
[1:43:43] they may tell you but there's something
[1:43:45] real about you
[1:43:48] now you're living boldly now you're
[1:43:49] living as this salt of the earth the
[1:43:52] world wants to see men and women who are
[1:43:54] just exactly what they're supposed to be
[1:43:58] what you profess to be
[1:44:02] because they'll believe you if they can
[1:44:03] see it
[1:44:05] they don't want nothing to do with it if
[1:44:07] it if it don't look like it's true
[1:44:10] stand boldly
[1:44:11] if i wasn't for christ tonight i'd be
[1:44:13] standing here against him but i know
[1:44:15] he's real and i love him and that's why
[1:44:17] i'm here for him no doubt someday will
[1:44:20] seal my testimony with my blood but i'm
[1:44:24] be happy at that day for i know that
[1:44:27] he's the lord jesus christ and i know he
[1:44:30] cannot fail i know he's love
[1:44:33] you see here he is
[1:44:34] he's standing in the same place as all
[1:44:37] these other sons and daughters of god
[1:44:38] throughout scripture
[1:44:40] from
[1:44:42] the three hebrew children
[1:44:44] to stephen standing there before the
[1:44:46] council
[1:44:48] to a prophet in our day
[1:44:50] to those of us who will stand boldly
[1:44:53] on the word
[1:44:55] if you'll stand boldly he'll back it up
[1:44:58] every time
[1:44:59] every time
[1:45:00] if you don't believe me go back
[1:45:04] there's 66 books to read through
[1:45:06] that'll tell you the same thing
[1:45:08] there's over 1100 messages to glean
[1:45:11] through that'll tell you the same thing
[1:45:14] go start gleaning the field is ripe for
[1:45:17] harvest
[1:45:18] but if you just leave it there it'll rot
[1:45:20] in the field
[1:45:22] don't leave it in the field bring it
[1:45:25] home
[1:45:26] if ruth had never gone to glean she
[1:45:28] would have never met boaz
[1:45:30] if you're not gleaning
[1:45:32] you'll never meet him
[1:45:34] and you know it was the meat gleaning
[1:45:37] humbling herself to go glean
[1:45:40] the meaning of boaz that later allowed
[1:45:42] her to stand boldly in the lineage of
[1:45:45] christ
[1:45:47] be willing to humble yourself and glean
[1:45:50] and you'll find you'll be able to stand
[1:45:51] boldly as the bride of jesus christ
[1:45:55] musicians if you want to come
[1:45:59] let's just pray
[1:46:01] heavenly father lord we just take this
[1:46:03] little simple message to father and just
[1:46:05] want to encourage and challenge your
[1:46:07] your people here father lord to know
[1:46:10] that they don't have to go through life
[1:46:12] beaten down
[1:46:14] father they don't have to take whatever
[1:46:17] life brings them and whatever the devil
[1:46:19] wants to throw their way
[1:46:21] but if they're willing to go and stand
[1:46:23] boldly upon the word
[1:46:25] stand boldly knowing that you have given
[1:46:27] us a promise father you'll be with us
[1:46:29] even in us until the ends of this world
[1:46:31] father and we have nothing to fear
[1:46:34] we don't have lord the world the world
[1:46:36] says you have nothing to fear but fear
[1:46:38] itself
[1:46:39] and yet even fear
[1:46:41] is not a
[1:46:42] thing to fear for the believer father
[1:46:45] lord people fear many things but all
[1:46:47] those fears disappear and dissipate in
[1:46:50] the presence of the of the king
[1:46:52] the lord we ask that we'd be able to
[1:46:54] come father
[1:46:55] lord that all fears would melt away
[1:46:57] father lord many fears complexes people
[1:47:01] don't think of that as a fear but father
[1:47:03] a complex is a fear
[1:47:05] satan would want to put complexes on
[1:47:07] your people father trying to hold them
[1:47:09] down
[1:47:11] lord but you've come to break the chains
[1:47:13] of complexes
[1:47:14] you come to break the chains of fear and
[1:47:17] put upon them by this world put upon
[1:47:19] them by
[1:47:20] organizations and religious spirits
[1:47:23] father lord you've come to set them free
[1:47:26] that they could stand boldly and exclaim
[1:47:29] the salvation of the lord i will just
[1:47:32] dedicate this to you as you be with your
[1:47:34] people as they travel home those who
[1:47:36] travel both near and far you keep them
[1:47:37] safe on the road father
[1:47:39] that you would be their guide
[1:47:41] lord and that your presence would go
[1:47:42] with them
[1:47:44] and they would know where they stand
[1:47:46] in jesus most wonderful and precious
[1:47:47] name we pray
[1:47:54] just be it unto me

[1:48:13] your promises
[1:48:16] i can stand
[1:48:23] secured upon
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:32] me free
[1:48:36] according to
[1:48:38] the world
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:52] me

[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:24] oh
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:38] once again i would just want for us to
[1:49:40] take that word
[1:49:41] to the lord in prayer again
[1:49:46] ecclesiastes chapter 8
[1:49:48] verse 1 says who is a wise man
[1:49:51] and who know where the interpretation of
[1:49:54] a thing
[1:49:56] a man's wisdom
[1:49:58] making his face to shine
[1:50:01] and the boldness of his face
[1:50:04] shall be changed
[1:50:06] amen
[1:50:08] we live in such an age
[1:50:10] where
[1:50:12] an age that is just on the edge and
[1:50:15] people get
[1:50:17] so nervous people get so angry
[1:50:22] there's no anger in boldness
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:27] there is no anger in boldness
[1:50:31] there is no rudeness in boldness
[1:50:35] if you go and look through the scripture
[1:50:37] and you look at the word boldness every
[1:50:39] time it was used
[1:50:41] it is almost in the same context of what
[1:50:44] we were saying is
[1:50:45] is is
[1:50:48] the grace of god or the holy spirit
[1:50:50] getting the hold of a man and getting a
[1:50:53] hold of a woman
[1:50:55] just like that scripture that brother
[1:50:56] jordan read in that hour
[1:50:59] while you are not thinking about it is
[1:51:01] not a premeditated talk but god will
[1:51:03] give you the right words
[1:51:06] there is no fear in boldness
[1:51:11] it is completely is a man being honored
[1:51:14] a man or a woman being honored the
[1:51:17] control of the holy spirit
[1:51:20] there is just there is such a peace in
[1:51:21] your heart
[1:51:23] you are not shaking
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:31] god has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:51:34] he has given us the spirit of power
[1:51:37] other translations say he has given us
[1:51:39] the spirit of boldness
[1:51:44] that's what it is
[1:51:45] it's what god gives
[1:51:49] he gave the spirit of boldness in the
[1:51:52] hour of need for our weaknesses
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:59] you are not bored when you are angry
[1:52:02] and you just want to say what is on your
[1:52:04] mind that's not being born
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:10] in one sense that's been ruled
[1:52:13] if you just want to give the person the
[1:52:15] peace of your mind
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:24] let's take our house to the lord tonight
[1:52:27] we are living in such a time but branham
[1:52:30] says with the pressure of this age
[1:52:34] sometimes we oppress
[1:52:36] and almost press out
[1:52:41] let's take our house to the lord tonight
[1:52:51] lord you have not given us the spirit of
[1:52:53] fear
[1:52:56] we are coming into
[1:52:58] that our lord father word
[1:53:01] this bride must put on
[1:53:03] such a spirit it would come from you
[1:53:05] it's not something that lord we can
[1:53:07] produce
[1:53:08] it is something that you give your
[1:53:10] children in the hour of need
[1:53:13] in the hour of need
[1:53:17] you find many of those believers that
[1:53:19] are going through persecution
[1:53:23] they will tell you in those hours of
[1:53:25] need
[1:53:27] something just got a hold of them
[1:53:30] and they were able to
[1:53:31] speak peacefully without fear
[1:53:35] just like shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:53:38] like our brothers say oh king they were
[1:53:40] not rude about it
[1:53:42] okay
[1:53:47] they were not rude about it they were
[1:53:48] not angry about it
[1:53:50] even if our god don't deliver us we will
[1:53:53] not bow down
[1:53:55] it's where the spirit
[1:53:57] the nature the human nature of man comes
[1:54:00] under control
[1:54:03] by the spirit of god comes under control
[1:54:05] by the holy ghost
[1:54:10] you are not choosing your words because
[1:54:12] you don't even have words on your own
[1:54:16] you are depending on god to speak
[1:54:18] through you
[1:54:20] you are saying father not my will but
[1:54:23] let your will be done
[1:54:34] church we are slowly coming to that
[1:54:36] place
[1:54:40] where we need to give a reason of the
[1:54:42] hope that dwarf in us
[1:54:47] the reason
[1:54:49] to give the hope
[1:54:50] of this jesus that we love
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:55:00] father take away every spirit of
[1:55:02] frustration
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:06] take away father lord
[1:55:08] every anger
[1:55:12] and bitterness lord and indifference
[1:55:15] lord
[1:55:16] because father this is the hour this is
[1:55:19] the time this is what is upon us lord
[1:55:21] this is what we are slowly coming into
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:28] sometimes it's not a person
[1:55:30] when you when you read the news
[1:55:33] what is your reaction
[1:55:36] [Music]
[1:55:37] when we hear the things that are out
[1:55:39] there what is your reaction
[1:55:42] [Music]
[1:55:47] dear lord
[1:55:48] thank you for your word tonight
[1:55:51] thank you father for your word tonight
[1:56:00] we just pray to god
[1:56:04] it's not something that we can
[1:56:05] manufacture
[1:56:08] the spirit of boldness is now something
[1:56:11] that a man can manufacture every time a
[1:56:14] man tried to be
[1:56:16] bold in himself
[1:56:19] he uses cursing words and he
[1:56:22] said things peter was trying to be born
[1:56:27] when they ask asking
[1:56:29] [Music]
[1:56:31] are you not one of them
[1:56:34] started cursing
[1:56:36] started saying things
[1:56:39] father
[1:56:42] make our house truth lord make our heart
[1:56:45] tender
[1:56:46] make our hearts
[1:56:48] obedience to your word or father
[1:56:52] if we are not
[1:56:54] spending time in your word if we are
[1:56:56] that lord
[1:56:58] bringing our temper on our knees
[1:57:04] and our father where you should be
[1:57:07] glorified in our way you should take
[1:57:09] over lord many times we find ourselves
[1:57:12] taking over the wheel
[1:57:15] and moving this vehicle of our life
[1:57:17] right into shame
[1:57:19] help us lord
[1:57:22] help us father
[1:57:24] [Music]
[1:57:28] thank you tonight
[1:57:30] we pray that lord you
[1:57:33] cause us to think on these things lord
[1:57:38] may we go may we take our
[1:57:40] bible

[1:57:45] able to read different different
[1:57:47] examples that the scripture gave us of
[1:57:49] boldness
[1:57:51] [Music]
[1:57:54] right there in the book of us the
[1:57:56] scripture says peter still good bonus
[1:57:59] this very man i was full of shame
[1:58:03] he was so nervous telling lies all over
[1:58:06] himself
[1:58:10] but when you got a hold of him
[1:58:13] when he got the holy ghost
[1:58:16] he could stand bowling
[1:58:21] thank you jesus tonight
