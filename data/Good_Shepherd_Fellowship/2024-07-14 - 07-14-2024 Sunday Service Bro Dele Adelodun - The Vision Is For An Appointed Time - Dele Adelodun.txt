us here also take care and take Glory thank you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen the Lord bless you uh so I don't keep you standing I'll suggest that we read the word word then you can take the comfort of your seat and then we trust the Lord to take it from there if you have your Bibles please turn with me to the book of habakuk chapter 2 ABAC chapter 2 and I will read also from Jeremiah 29 I was going to speak on the people of the atonement this morning but the Lord uh impressed this one strongly in my heart uh and I hope it's a blessing to somebody ABAC chapter 2 verse 2- 4 and then we shall read also Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 if you are there say heyen and the Lord answered and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that reth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith amen Jeremiah chapter 29 the 11th verse he said for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected hand may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his holy word God bless you may please be seated I'd like to greet every one of you this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and uh I want to thank God for uh making it possible for me to pass by here I never thought I would be able to pass by I was just going to quietly uh move through the east coast to the Caribbean and uh but the pastor challenged me int intentionally and uh I find out that it looks like I was committing a sin by that Omission so I had to make restitutions and that somehow we're able to work it out uh for me to be here today and I'm so grateful for the opportunity and I thank him also very much for his confidence uh to have me stand before the people of God and uh even in his absence he didn't tell me it wasn't going to be around but at a point you know we were sled for a meeting together uh to help attend to some matters in the uh East Coast so but at a point shortly before I came it said you know you know how your pastor talks he navigated and uh pass it to me in a way so I was wondering okay what will that mean will it mean it will be here or it will not be here but by the time we we had the meeting uh it became clear to me that it wasn't going to be here and uh well all is well I think this was the certain the Lord saw before the foundation of the world and it's just good enough for us to be in the program of God so I'm glad I'm here today uh in the will of the Lord and I'm glad to see everyone of you uh doing well in the Lord also I bring the greetings of the Saints back in Nigeria and that of my wife in the house they are all doing well by the grace of God I've uh it's been a journey of few week uh few weeks for me now uh though I had a small break in Nigeria coming from Canada United Kingdom and then here and uh all the saints along the way they told us you know they will ask where am I where will will I be next and once I tell them they said you must carry our greetings to the Brethren there so I don't know I don't know you will meet who you will not meet just in case you meet somebody and say did that brother pass our greetings please let them know I did thank you very much God bless you and uh I was warmly received yesterday I appreciate BR arel for uh doing my airport and the church runs thank you and uh thank the pastor's wife and the old Mama there also for their cares glad to see all of you my land lady where she where she okay she stepped out glad to see you br sit here and ah BR P sister Jen yeah I can mention all of you now all right but let me spear that so we can have more time for the word the Lord bless you richly it's just expressing my heart of joy that at last I was able to be here God bless you all right God helping us this morning which I believe he will I want to speak on the subject that was so impressed upon my heart that replaced what I had in mind it is uh the vision is for an appointed time the vision is for an appointed time uh from the scripture that we read in the book of ABAC uh the prophet of God was saying uh the vision is for an appointed time he said though it t wait for it then he also said it will not t ahuh so the Bible is not actually contradicting itself but the scripture is taking into account that uh the interaction of that scripture is between two dimensions the one who is speaking lives in eternity Dimension we time does not matter and the one who is been spoken to lives in a Time Dimension where time counts you understand and uh how you begin to appreciate the scripture is this uh the Bible said uh a day in eternity is as a thousand years on Earth is that right right so if the Lord gives you a promise now and uh you are looking at your clock and you say it's 10 years I've been waiting for this thing and uh you are bothering God in prayers I'm just giving an illustration then he will look at his own time and say Bo it's just some few seconds away away that I talk to this can't this child just be a little patient few seconds so that is why what looks like it's staring before you is just in time before God and that is why the scripture said though itari is speaking your language there he said you wait for it but hope there nothing ties because everything happens according to the appointed season and I want this understanding to register in our heart very deeply and to know that look we ourselves we the thoughts of God expressed you understand and the thoughts of God they are very real and very certain nothing can be added to it nothing can be taken away from it so if you are that expressed thought the beginning of your Advent on Earth till you will live it's all an unfolding of God's thought are you following so really nothing can be added nothing can be taken away from it brother Braham said it gives you yourself an eternal quality because you came from the mind of God now in that Mind Of God he had season that he has appointed for certain things in your life and until God comes to its season by his thoughts conclusion about you what you are expecting may not come to pass now the the challenge we have is for human beings who live in time to always try to outrun God you want to do things out of season you want to help yourself Sarah would still have had a child anyway are you with me Brethren because sometimes if you don't make it illustrative people don't get it now Sarah will still have had that child you know why because God promised it and Heaven and Earth will pass away whatever God promises or say must come to pass even Christ himself said my we will not return to me void how many believe that so Sarah will have had that child I don't care how old she grew she would still have had that child and the scripture proved it that she will have had it because she had it when God yeah when God was ready to bring it to pass nature meant nothing to God I'm growing old I'm growing young I'm entering menopause those things meant nothing to God what go you know what means something to God is what he had said because behind every statement of God lies his reputation and there is nothing of demon not even Satan that can soil the reputation of God but you see here is the same sah who went to her husband she wanted to she wanted to help the program she said you know what get my maid maybe through her that is your own invention God does not need assistance God does not need any human support what he needs from you is Faith what he needs for you is to believe brother Braham said God expects that when he speaks his children just take it like that you know you tell a little child you say I'll buy you candies when I'm coming he will never doubt it he's just waiting for candies when he sees the car pull out it comes out without any provision for disappointment Dad where is my Candice because he believed you and that is the way you must believe God God where is your promise you can fail you told me and I'm holding onto it like a Lifeline but the prophet said anytime we try to help ourself it will backfire so when Sarah tried to help the project you all knew what happened eventually it backfired she even couldn't live with what she called her achievement because it was an achievement for her to get a child a child by the maid said maybe when I know the child it will condition me to have my own very good thought but that wasn't God's program amen because Sarah has had a definitive word of God on that matter once you hear God speak definite just hold on to that and don't ever look at yourself look con stantly at that word when every other thing fails that word will never fail that is why the prophet said we can hold on to his word as a Lifeline God bless you the Lord who created seasons for planting and harvesting is only trying to express his nature or his own desire the way he works by Nature I tell you that God can plant his seed today his seed of wheat today and harvest it the next second is that okay you don't believe that okay what do you think happened when after his convention there were 5,000 people who will have been stranded Because by the time they left the place McDonald's and the rest will have closed and they said the time is so late dismiss the audience but Christ was enjoying their Fellowship isn't it it's said don't worry let me finish the service when he finished the service they knew nobody will get food and he said make all the people to sit down and what do you have let's give them they said pastor is there is there something wrong we are talking of 5,000 men besides women so the crowd could have been 10 or 12,000 if you had the children and you are saying what what could we have had to take care of all this he said let them sit down because God knew there was a little boy who will bring food because he inspired the mother because he knew what he wanted to do uhhuh uhhuh these things there's no coincidence in God's economy there's no chance event so when they brought the food see what happened the Bible said he blessed the food and he distributed to the disciples start serving so what do you think happened when they cut the bread it grew back when they caught it kept growing back until 5,000 men besides women and children were fed is that right now so what happened in the hand there was that whe was planted yes harvested processed into flow gone to Bakery baked as a brad amen all in one chance is there anything too hard for the Lord no impossibility in his economy so this God who can do this taught you that there should be planting season cultivating season and then harvest season and he likes you to follow the direction of seasons and in the way he did the calendar he did it in such a way that the son you know the eat of the Sun during planting is different from the one at Harvest yes because if you have the aest son during planting you are going to burn your seed in the ground so it makes it mild in planting and it makes it a little tough in Harvest so that he can promote ripening is to tell you that I have appointed season in which I do certain things and let me tell you it's only God that can act out of season because he's the creator of Seasons amen he can act out of season but he expects you in your followership of him to follow his appointed time anytime you take the matter upon yourself you are bound to fail so let us learn to wait upon God is that those who wait upon God shall renew their strength they shall M up with wings as an eagle they will run and not be weary and they will walk and never faint may the Lord teach you to wait upon him amen you love him this morning okay with that background let me tell you what inspired me for this subject the prophet of the Lord shared an experience of his own life with us amen now for our guest when I said the prophet of the lord we believe God sent us a messenger in this age amen but let me leave it at that so if by his experience your appetite is W you can ask for more and then we can we can stay whole day this is all I do in my life this is all I do amen 24 hours I'm ready praise God I love to talk about Jesus praise God so that's fine amen so he told us of an experience that the had you know with God through the event of a brother there's a brother called brother John hem he was somebody like you and I he believed the law the word he was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he started attending services at Braham Tabernacle but one thing led to the order it backs leaded on God don't ever leave your place of safe Retreat I know we backl every day yeah and the word says anytime we fail to do what we should do it's a Backle inness and we must repent every day that's what Paul said I Die daily are you with me Breen but you see no matter what happens to you you are still better off under the cover of the blood than outside there let nothing take you out of the range of the Lord I'm talking to somebody to you this morning if the devil is teaching you or trying to pressure you to walk out on the Lord amen you need what I'm saying whatever is happening to you that you are being frustrated about is happening in t to your people who are in the world and that's why there are suicides and all kind of things every day but you are still standing because you have a bumper something that is cushioning the effect for you until you lose it you won't appreciate its value so you are better off to stay under the blood than outside of the blood because when you walk out on God you are like a man leaving Jerusalem going to Jericho is a wrong direction every body should be ascending towards Jerusalem amen there you know when you are descend you to leave Jerusalem to go to Jericho is a dissension yes but to go from Jericho to Jerusalem is an Ascension I'm pressing on the upward Way new ID I'm ging every day still praying as I'm onward bound Lord plant my feet on IR ground that is the way it must be getting with us every day Hallelujah ascending into the heavenlies getting better each day but when you are descending you are backsliding you are coming from the heights that you should retain Believers don't live low they live in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus far above principalities and powers that was why because he was taking the wrong direction he met the wrong people the there is nothing for you when you backslide when you descend the road of Jerusalem you are going to meet thieves and robbers and they're going to deal with you amen you know why because you have isolated yourself from the protection of the blood are you getting it so nothing will be there to Bumper To shield and to protect you if you're on that road this morning you are the reason for this message please come back to Christ amen because you won't you won't meet angels in that direction if you ever met them is to tell you to go back and if you refuse their warning you are going to get robbers and thieves who are going to deal with you so badly wound you so heavily and M you terribly until they will leave you half dead which the prophet said physically alive but spiritually dead amen yes that was the experience of this brother John Hil when he went out on God he suddenly found himself fighting you know when you take a coal of fire from a bunch of coals of fire the day you isolated from that Bunch you killed it yes but the death will not immediately manifest because it takes the collection of the Cs so to sustain each other's Fire by the time you take one out it will still be burning for a while but you see it's gradually extinguishing the light is the spark is not getting higher it's getting lower until it will die so when em left God it didn't you know look like a bad man immediately but gradually he found himself fighting isn't that bad then he found himself committed mother in the process of fighting he killed the person and in killing the person he was jailed he became a prisoner and he served time for many years and in the process his first born died everything was just falling like a pack of cards on brother John then he came out trying to pack the beats and pieces of his life is surviving son the only son left because he's got two children also took ill and was going to die then brother John said I must do something about my life and I thank God for him he ran to the right place now for you to know that that was the Finger of God the prophet said when jario daughter took very heill and nobody could help that girl he said it was God's f finger to make jarot to reveal who truly he is because he has been a secret believer and God wanted him to testify about Christ openly am he wants him to openly identify so sometimes the challenges of our life they are not to destroy us they are not even to decimate us it is to do what is to cultivate a virtue are you with me and let me tell you God will get you except you are not a seed of God if you are a seed of God there's no much to worry about if I could confirm that that fellow is a seed of God I don't care what he's doing let him be in the brutal it doesn't matter to me let him be drinking himself to stup or even on drugs it doesn't matter to me I know at God's appointed time amen God will do something amen amen some will take make it easy God will give easy appoint invitation but if they don't mind God because God cannot lose anyone for whom he has given Thanksgiving by the way do you realize that he gave Thanksgiving on all of you that are here he said father I thank you for all that you gave unto me I lose none John chapter 10 except the son of pedition that he might go to his own place God couldn't have offered Thanksgiving about you and withdraw it back it's impossible so he will do all he could and all he should to bring you home Hallelujah if you accept his easy Pro soft proposal he makes it soft for you if you want hard proposal it's going to make it hard for you but guess what God will have his way in your life and in my life he will have his way so this morning prepare to meet you your Lord are you enjoying the Lord praise God Amen all right so for you to know it was all God's finger on John Emil's son before John Emil rose up because he thought what must I do now let me go and look for my pastor that's brother Braham and go back to him to see if you could come and pray for my son so that they will be relieved but before he got to the prophet God had given the prophet a vision of the same John H a man who had long backed for you to see how much God was mindful of that brother he gave the prophet a vision about him that this is the condition of this boy this is the condition of this man his son and this is what I'm going to do so God took the prophet practic Ally to the house of John he saw everything and he even saw the healing of the boy so by the time the prophet was coming out of the vision he was hearing a knock at his door and guess who came in the same man he saw in the vision then he told him he said don't worry brother John your son will be all right so in that Vision brother Emil had seen his cousin who is uh brother Graham Snelling in the vision no no no brother Braham had seen that cousin but you see it has to be God arranging the picture by himself so suddenly John Emil said okay before we go the prophet said I'll go with you he said but before we go while you are preparing let me go get my cousin gram Snelling because in that Vision Graham Snelling was there all right so he went to get Graham Snelling and they were all they started on the journey and as they were going the prophet said in your heart do you have a d fold chair whatever that means a blue color he said yes it's there in my house he mentioned certain things yes is there he said this little boy we're going to pray for does he have a pair of codron jeans he said he's wearing it right now then all of a sudden he felt Jed said have you been to my house before and the prophet said yes I've been to your house before but not in the form you taught then he told him is brother John if you say you were a church member here before before sin took you out you must have had me spoke of Visions Andor he the Lord he said you see whoever is telling me those things has never failed for once that same person came back to tell me before you came he showed me the healing of your son he said John your son is going to be all right oh then John broke down he quickly pked the car he wept like a baby to see how much God could be so mindful of him even in his low condition and brother Braham said ride on that road we restore John back to the Lord so in the excitement and the joy of seeing a child of God came back home you know the Bible said Heaven rejoice when his sinner returns amen the hell Satan count his losses but God count His blessings and we will also be happy with you this morning if you can make your way to Christ the world has got nothing to offer you but you've got every blessing in the Lord Jesus Christ you say what kind of blessing until you come you won't appreciate it come in first glory to God if I was eating an apple and I tell you so sweet you may believe me but you say how do I know he sweet I say you need to eat a portion to appreciate it isn't it so come eat a portion this morning Jesus is so sweet I've been preaching him for 35 years it's getting sweeter every day amen you say how do I know it's sweet come tast it with come tasting with me and your life will never be the same again he said is no secret what he can do what he did for one he can do for the other keep your hands wide open and accept him this morning John Emil came to Christ right there and everybody get excited and happy and as soon as they got home in that excitement the prophet never waited for the vision to come in order okay he just asked for the baby he said bring me the baby now because he saw him healed in the vision and he carried the baby and he prayed for him and instead of the baby getting better he got worse the vision is for an appointed time it got so worse until he was almost lifeless and they had to put him back on the floor or somewhere there you can imagine what that would mean to somebody who is been looked up to to come and offer help and instead of offering help he offered more damage I can imagine how what a tension it should be for the prophet at that time and you see in retrospect we could easily relate with the problem why the reason but he didn't even know immediately he was just there what could have gone wrong what could have gone wrong what could have gone wrong what could have gone wrong he never had that answer until almost 24 hours the prophet did a full day A W day I think in the afternoon or so it he didn't leave the place throughout the night till the day break because he just didn't know what to do he didn't know what went wrong but what went wrong was the fact that he never waited on God for the pieces of the vision to come together that is what you life is all about when God conceived you in his thought he got pieces of the puus that must come together for you to get to certain mileage amen so God has to be patient with his own Vision about you but most times you don't appreciate that you start jumping here and there H the Bible said there are many devices in the heart of a man I think I spoke on that the last time it's but the counsel of the Lord is what with stand so I'm giving you this to give you peace and to make you settle relax because nothing can be out of ker oh what peace you hav forfeit oh what needless pain you bear rest little bright all is well if you've got Christ on the boat what would make you ever to imagine that the boat can be sunk It's Impossible the disciples were borning energies and they were expecting Christ to appreciate them when the boat was about to be sung you know they were sweing thinking that they want to save Jesus who can save Jesus and Jesus my Lord was in the boat sleeping forgive me probably snoring and just having a good time sleeping and he never bought about the storm when they got tired of their effort they asked to go wake Jesus all you need is Wake Jesus is said master car not that we perish that is that is a most uncomplimentary statement you have Jesus in the both and you are making provision for Destruction is that possible and you expect Christ to get up and say and and commend them for their effort he never did read your Bible rather he rebuke them he said you of little faith you are insulting me that my presence is not capable to protect you I'm right here in this boat and you are Imagining the boat could capsize that's an insult to the presence of God he still an insult you today that's why the prophet said all I labor is to do is to bring you to the recognition of the presence of God in our midst when when you recognize his presence there are some things you know you just key into that presence and you start receiving things that's right oh my I pray God will reveal it to his church he got up and he said peace be still hey then the people said what manner of man is this that even the storm even the waves obeyed his voice that's the kind of God I serve and that's the kind of God you have you've got to be conscious of that in any situation that with Christ nothing can get out of C you love him so here was the prophet couldn't make it out why dis us to be then everybody was helpless I I want to believe that there was no sleep in that night because everybody must fashion out what is the next step as far as they are concerned John help me believe that his only Last Hope rest in this man's prayer and this man's prayer hasn't relieved anything but created more problems then the grace of God came on the prophet and said you know what happened you went ahead of the vision the vision is for an appointed time it said in that Vision you saw an old woman who was part of the scene where is the woman brother brah said that is true that is true the old woman is not here and he can go and bring any old woman did you get it you can't work it out you can't arrange it God has God who gave it as to arrange the puzzle by himself the prophet said if I see a v in the vision this Anker Chief handkerchief on the pulpit standing here for instance he said if in reality he still standing here I cannot do anything and I cannot take the handkerchief myself except I was the one in the vision who took it if I was not the one I must wait for the handkerchief to move from here to here amen that is how detailed God is in bringing his word to pass all I'm saying be taken it as a story of your own life this is the answer to he said why this why that why this it all the puzzles that God is arranging allow God the right of way amen you know so it said the whole woman is not there yet he said ah Lord I'm sorry he said not only that he said the mother of the baby ought to be leaning by the do poost of the door weeping said she's not there then gram snailing your cousin ought the cousin of johnil ought to be sitting where you brother Braham is now sitting and he cannot invite him come and sit because it was God who arranged everything by himself so what he needed was patient to wait for God based on his own timing God didn't give him the number of hours he going to take but he couldn't have Minister any blessing until he sees the picture perfect so he said oh oh I missed it completely I was too excited I saw John came back to Christ I was too excited God said no problem now this o thing ran from the afternoon or so till the next day MH when morning Came John brother Graham Snelling was to go back to work was to go and resume work John was going to carry him hey brother Braham said God have mercy upon me if these two people leave that means I cannot leave here until they returned because in the vision they were there but he couldn't tell them please don't go are you say it he couldn't said you don't you shouldn't go there's something I'm working out no sir he is not the one to work it out you are not the one to work it out you are only to take the program yes so he said in my heart was saying Lord have mercy I've done a night and a day if these people leave I will be here another full day until they return then so they dressed up they were ready to go and asked brother Braham would you want us to drop you at home h brother Braham said no I can go for now I can go I have to be here he said okay I'll go drop brother Graham and come back to you so they actually stepped out and they actually got into the car then the old woman that is saw in the vision came from the behind through the kitchen she turned out to be the grandmother for that baby and and she ask her daughter how is the boy and the lady said mama she is no good and the whole woman started crying and the mother of the baby started crying it was their cry that attracted the attention of John and Graham and they asked to come out of the car and came back [Music] inside you see how God is arranging his things so they now had to come and console the two women and as they were consoling the two women after they felt a bit relieved there was an apron That was supposed to be on the wall cabinet the old woman just went for the apron where it was and put it on the wall cabinet brother brah said thank God he coming [Music] Hallelujah the picture is coming back and uh the prophet said I got up from where I was sitting knowing Graham should be sitting there so I got up I was walking around and uh John and Graham looked at themselves they realized that the atmosphere is not right for them to leave so Graham went and sat exactly where the Prophet saw him the prophet said Thank God he's coming amen then the old woman after her crying she went and sat on the sofa the prophet said Thank God is coming and he said in his that if this lady could just go to where I saw her that's the mother of the baby and you know he can tell her you know you go you go save my time and he was there waiting and after a while the lady just walked towards that door leaned on the door post and she was weeping that was the picture perfect then brother Bram got up Hallelujah he said brother John do you still have confidence in me Hey Brother John said by every means I have confidence in you Pastor he said some of you your confidence that's a lesson your confidence is so cheap so it is easily lost yeah if you have something of value you don't lose it any any little conversation I lost confidence in you what's wrong with you here is a man who could really have done it but no brother Braham said if you truly have confidence in me lift up that boy carry him and bring him here and the prophet said you will not understand what that meant because the ponia had create some H meaning the boy is already bleeding internally so if care is not taken the way you carry him may make him bled to death but John said I will do anything you tell me he went for his boy and carried and give it to the prophet then brother Braham said you know why this boy did not heal it was because I'm the problem I went ahead of the vision he said but now everything I saw it's in its place so there will be no reason for this boy not to be all right and in less than two minutes of prayer the boy jumped out of the hands of the Prophet amen perfectly whole amen am the vision is for an appointed time so brother Braham said in the vision I saw the boy made three twists meaning it will be three days that he will be perfectly fully recovered he said said and on that third day I'm going to come back here and watch if that boy he said that boy when I come back wherever that boy is playing he will get up with milk mustache amen covering his lips amen and walk up to me and hel out hold out his hand and shake me and said brother Braham I am perfectly well now the prophet said if that does not happen like that call me a false prophet amen amen amen and thankfully it turned out to be a Wednesday this was Sunday this was Wednesday all right amen and uh on Wednesday when he announced that a lot of people said we want to follow to go and see what happened so these Breen jumped in their cars and they were going they were going they were they got to the house I'm sure some were nervous what if it did not happen and brother Braham who knows that do see the Lord can never fail he walked boldly towards the door where they have an inscription God bless our home he knocked at the door and the mother of the baby opened the door as the prophet stepped in the Breen were watching from the window to see what was going to happen as the prophet stepped in the boy by the power of that prophecy turned from where he was playing with little neighbor's children and got up with milk mustache amen and they walked to the prophet and he said exactly the same word does say the Lord can never fail the vision is for an appointed time though itar amen wait for it amen in heaven nothing ties in heaven everything happened according to plan amen Lazarus was not meant to just be sick he was meant to die amen he wasn't just meant to die he was meant to be corrupting sometimes you don't see God on the scene until it becomes a perfectly hopeless case amen and some those things are not because maybe you are a wor sinner or anything amen God is only building trust and confidence amen are you with me he allowed Daniel to get into the lion's den it could have prevented him entering amen but is said getting there and let's give the devil a run for his money or for his power and Daniel got in there and instead of the lions attacking him a millennium started there God allows certain things so that the story can be written like that in a manner that you produce a testimony and virtue for somebody else to tap into he allowed the three Brew children to get into the fire and became number four man amen and he didn't hide his identity when Nebuchadnezzar came he introduced himself I am the I am the Son of God I am the number four man in here I identify with my home people through th in anywhere even Nebuchadnezzar despite his adolat Tendencies could recognize that the appearance of that number four looks like the Son of God everybody ought to know who our Lord is so it could allowed you to get to the dead end amen amen Israel got to a dead end isn't it the sea before them looking back it was Pharaoh and on either side Hills and Valleys so there's no option they were in a closeup amen and God could get you into that Dead Hand sometimes just to show his power if you have tasted salvation you must taste the power of God it's all the blessings of redemption only believe all things are possible POS my friend Hallelujah all right do you still have few more times to go okay we can continue a little while okay now you look at Joseph God gave a vision to Joseph now in Joseph you will see that there are things God chooses to reveal and there are things he keeps to himself so your journey with God must always be a journey of trust when you come to a point in your life that you realize that whatever no matter what happens God cannot be wrong then you are coming to Christianity right are you with me the cstone Revelation you must have above every revelation of mystery is to know that God cannot not be wrong there are many things you will not be able to understand and God himself will put you on the spot to make your ability to defend him impossible underline it in your mind what would you have thought how what answers will Mary and Mata have given to critics when you know the Bible said when they wrote to Jesus to invite him home to pray for Lazarus they wrote an intimate letter Lazarus your friend whom thou love is sick but despite all the qualification of the relationship did it affect Jesus to come no Jesus never came now to a natural eye would that not look like a callous insensitive position it will give a good Revival to those who are critics of Jesus say look at the men they give their all to and according to history the cloth of Many Colors the clothes that was woven without SE that the soldiers were parting among themselves on the cross was actually given to Christ by that family when they accepted Christ they defied all the denominations the structure of religion in that day they damed all of them and kill to Christ they housed Christ they fed Christ they give Christ cloth this is all you can do for a servant of God or for the things of God so they met all requirement for Christ to be there for them in their hour of need but the more they called Christ the father he went you didn't C he was in I when David when uh yeah because we've dream driven to AA before I said brother brother one he drove going I drove coming or I drove going he drove coming about three less than four hours strip that was some years ago all right so AA is quite close isn't it when Lazarus was sick Christ was in IA by the time his condition was worse they called him to come instead of coming he moved to the his coast and you know New York in Atlanta they are major hubs so he just got on an international flight and boom he was in Africa he was so far away that by the time Lazarus died he was too far away to even come in time for burier and you will call that a pastor to Lazarus so if the critics brother Steve if the critics were asking Mary and Mata about Christ how do you think they will defend him if acted in a manner that defending him became a burden but that is how my lord does are you with me that is how my lord does to prove you if you think that in itself can Dent his reputation you on a long thing because he knows what he's doing do you know the Lord said deliberately I was not there when they announced to him that he was dead he said I am glad for your sakes I was not there so meaning his action was deliberate was intentional it wasn't an accidental or something he was helpless about he did it like that okay if I was there the day he died they would say he actually wasn't sick right if I healed him when he was sick they would say he wasn't sick they only pretended so that they can you know rais my profile before the people if he died and he raised him up they would say he actually fainted he didn't really die so he left everything it was before them he got sick they saw him when he died actually they conducted the funeral and buried him so there's no controversy to the fact that the man was dead and scientifically after 72 hours corruption set in so for one full day corruption was working on Lazarus then Jesus came now when he came was he late amen came forth this later but it was still on time he changed the narrative by his coming and he's still the same God he will change your life's narrative when he appears only believe all things are possible don't take the matter into no no no no leave it let go and let go there is not no matter how complex your matter is is not outside of God's jurisdiction to handle you love him so here we have Brother Joseph a very spiritual brother in the church and the Lord has the purpose for Joseph's life amen now he gave him a vision and Joseph was somebody who is very expressive he came to church Brethren the Lord has just blessed me with a vision I don't know what it means but I saw something I saw me and my brothers we gathered our shav and uh after we maned them the sheaves of my brothers all these my brothers fell down to my own shav in the church that day brother said keep quiet what kind of a testimony are you giving you will expect Joseph to be courtious the next service another Vision had come he said Breen I have another testimony this time around 12 Stars sun and moon so mother and father included and all the 11 stars and sun and moon bow to my one star I said this boy now I'm saying that in Joseph's life we will see the revealed will of God and the secret Wills sometimes it shows you your destination but it never tells you how you will get there if he told Joseph how he's going to get there he wouldn't want he will want to frustrate the Fulfillment of that Vision but you see whatsoever the Lord has done it shall be forever nobody can have nobody can take away you must just accept it let's join in his life a little to see the nature of God in another way now what was the reason Moses said the secret things belong to God right he said but those things that are revealed are for her now what was the reason that God was giving Joseph such a vision if they were spiritual Brethren they will realize that what God was doing was to announce the reassignment of Birthright follow me now right I I think it was in Genesis uh was it 27 or 28 somewhere there Reuben who was the first born in that family who has the right to three blessings yes by being the first born he has the right to the birth right to rulership the leadership of the entire them and also to the priesthood the first Bor takes the three but because Reuben committed fornication that is why Apostle Paul won the church and is will still stand as a great warning today do not be a fornicator amen you don't want to say Amen to that all right okay suit yourself am amen but I we preach the word amen praise God hallelujah amen do not be a profane person amen or a fornicator there were two Birthright losers in the Bible Esau Reuben Esau wasn't the fornicator but he was a profane person profanity means taking Divine instructions lightly yeah when he sees the word the DeMent the instruction of the word he can say maybe God does not really mean it like that some of us are like that and that is why it's so easy for us to be rationalizing our action we never repent amen you will lose your inheritance like Saul did amen but Reuben was a fornicator he discovered his father's bed and the Bible said Jacob heard it but he never talked he kept it until the day that he was to leave and as a father he must pronounce blessing on Hall that was the day Reuben knew his father knew he say you are the beginning of my strength Excellency in dignity but as unstable as the waters are you will not Excel because you went to your father's bed is there in the Bible sin cost you amen and takes you further than you are prepared to go the way of of a transgressor is always very bad amen Sean sing this morning amen amen repent come to Christ is God the power to save from sin no man can deliver e or herself but all God needs from you is Readiness and willingness when he sees that desire he will come through for you amen you love him this morning amen now when Reuben did what he did God decided to take all the three blessings from him if I have time I will show you the scriptures take note either first or 2 Chronicles chapter 5 you will see it there he took the priesthood and gave it to the Levi gave it to Levi he took their rulership and gave it to Judah that was why Christ came from the tribe of Judah amen as the coming King are you with me then he took the birth right and gave it to Joseph meaning Joseph will be the soer and the provider and the protector of the entire family amen that's what Birthright means amen he will be the one to distribute all the assets of the father amen and yet he wasn't near the first born he was number 11 yes amen so when all these people were bowing to Joseph in the it was God's way announcing the reassignment of Birthright you see how do I know when you go back to the scripture and read the blessings of Birthright that Isaac pronounced on Jacob take note of these things go read them they will help you the world reads stories in the Bible we read life yeah so if you go read there one of the Articles of prayer was that let your brethren the children of your parents bow to you amen be thou their sorer be thou their provider amen is there Isaac said it am so the vision of Joseph is in line with the prayer of Isaac so he has a scriptural Vision but those Brethren were not spiritual enough to understand that this was what God was doing amen so they decided to do what to attack the vision it's it's a waste of time did you hear me you cannot stop the arrival of a carrier of a blessing he will arrive am you hear some people say uh it cannot be it cannot be denied but it can be delayed delayed by who am I defy that statement amen delayed by who God is doing something you say you are delaying it amen you are not fit amen amen what you don't understand is that God's program work according to his own appointed am do you realize that David was anointed king and he never took the throne until 15 years read your Bible he took the throne of Judah on the seventh year and it took the entire Throne of Israel another seven years 14 years went pass before David could become the king that is be anointed for earlier so the question becomes why did go why was God in a hurry to anoint him when he wasn't ready to install him am have you ever asked yourself that God only showed him his destination am what he will become to give him faith for the journey that no matter what happened this will be where we arrive but before you get to your destination God must work on you this is the story of rapture Brethren this is the story of adoption God must work on you he must fashion your image your your character in his likeness and that was why through that Journey David received the most sensitive Temptations are you with me amen he got caught with Sal twice that could have killed him because when David gets to the throne he's going to have unch unchallengeable power and God wanted to be sure that this man that will be entrusted with this Grace will be able to hold it right amen so he was working on his character amen for those periods there must be a character Amen to match every achievement otherwise you will lose yourself and what was meant to be a blessing will eventually destroy you amen it is the blessings of God that make it rich and added no sorrow so that you will not have sorrow God must work on you and build you in a fit maturity to be able to handle the success amen but since the vision was definite to David he knew he will rule he knew he will reain no matter the assault no matter the attack no matter the hindrance and that is is the faith it must build in you and I we shall surely arrive Hallelujah so this Breen said we will stop it they took it upon themselves let us see how Joseph will get there and you can read the story in the Bible but you see through it all God was guiding his vision because there must be an expected end that's right huh huh huh when they plotted to kill him God used Reuben the Reuben that created the problem to destroy the plot he said let us not kill him am amen God has not created a vessel that he cannot use amen whether you are Satan or you are Saint he will use you amen how many believe God is using Satan ah you don't believe that how come you have challenges that throw you into prayer sometimes your prayer life is so slack and God wants to wake it up he will call that guy said do something for this said but you ain't going to touch him you AR going to touch his life oh sure Satan is a use and dump in God's economy yes who created him by the way he created him for his pleasure the purpose of God is designed must Prosper must come to pass and without Satan that purpose is not complete if all you have is perfection this journey of Christianity will be too dull for you it will be too boring God must make thank you my land lady God must make you relate from somewhere you saw the way you sang Amazing Grace a while ago how did you feel about it so wonderful huh that was what Satan helped us produce ah they don't catch that Satan must bring to pass what is necessary to the purpose of God Amen if all you had was Perfection I say everything would be too boring and dull so God brought the devil to upset Perfection so that Redemption could be made necessary and through Redemption plan you can seek God you can t God as a Healer as a savior as a redeemer as a deliverer by the time you enjoy him in his attribute you are connected to him Beyond just being an object of worship amen but let me say something for a seed of God there is not enough activity of the devil that can send you to hell it will act to bring you to Perfection praise God so God used Reuben to save the day because he was protecting his word and Reuben said let's not kill him let's just throw him into the dungeon let if anything will happen to him let it happen naturally the Bible said in his heart he planned to come and rescue the boy and go and give him to his father but he say as good as his plan was it wasn't the program of God your Shepherd select the path you must tread in life before Reuben could come to fetch him out of the dungeon Brethren God brought the Arabians Merchants they fetched him out by themselves and the Breen came there and took money and that began the journey to the realization of the vision the ways of God are pass finding God does not see as men seeth he doesn't think like you do when you think this thing is all about adversary problems and challenges it is God's part way to bring you to that expected end that he has proposed for you you see God must blindfold and make a fool out of the devil sometimes because while those things was going on these guys were claiming Victory he said it's even good from dungeon to slavery as he was going the man who will rule over us go and rule over your fellow slaves I'm sure you will make a good slave for somebody in Egypt that's your hand man and truly it looks like that was his hand he got to Piper's house but you see the power of Promise of that prophecy was following this guy and look you've got to have the right attitude also for your challenges and that will only come if you have the revelation of what is going on did Joseph have the Revelation I say yes read your Bible when his Brethren came to beg for their lives he said you meant it for evil but all this episode was God sending me amen it wasn't you you were just being used Amen to send me ahead to serve your lives amen amen amen so many things he couldn't explain but he believed it was God working amen and that was why in all his situations he was having the right positive attitude am you never saw him dull you never saw him join the pity party you say how did you know Mr preacher hey this guy got to Piper's house and by the time P looked at his Carriage his conduct is said man there's something about this guy he's a complete stranger amen an undocumented immigrant amen amen he was an Egyptian he wasn't an Egyptian amen and yet a lord of Egypt could do what handed over his entire house even pitifer himself said that the only thing I know is the food I ate on my table if you want to know how much I'm worth the assets I have go ask Joseph amen how could that have happened amen if you was looking miserable dejected am don't give yourself on due high blood pressure amen but the the Bible told me my Lord told me he said by one anxiety you cannot add a centimeter to your stature in other word you cannot improve your life by worry no wonder our Prophet said worry is a curse amen amen mhm you said but who is free from worry Christians are free from worry amen amen God wants you to be happy let nothing temper with your joy amen look at every situation tell the situation I will crest you amen I will overcome you you cannot submerge me amen and let it give you a lift of positive attitude amen amen when you are positive in all situation you get Satan confused I don't know what I would do to this guy to upset him in his life that is a life we must leave Brethren get him confused all the time I've given you an example now if he was looking dejected and miserable will they appoint him the head of the house no you see the truth the blessings are hidden between the lines you don't entrust your house to somebody who is unhappy am somebody who is so sad discontented dejected uh what do you call it depression prone amen how would you entr and those are the things we walk ourselves into when God has given you the blessings of his word who will wake up every morning and read the promises to his ourself and tell his soul our soul don't worry the Lord will make a way somehow I don't know it's going to be fixed but I know he will fix it that is a positive attitude of a Believer not to sit in the pity party corner and allow the devil to be telling you your problem is the most peculiar on the earth he lies and because you also oh God you have you have you have element of deception you will take that how can how can the devil tell you you have the most peculiar problem on Earth how many people do you know on Earth in the what is the sample population is using for you in the streets where you live how many people do you know there how many homes have you entered I'm challenging you now don't you think it's possible in some of the homes in there in some of the apartments there are people who have been bed reading for 12 years do they look like what sinner than you oh and he'll be selling you a lie and you'll be absorbing it and everybody will be under tension oh God help our sister we are wasting your time and you are wasting our time I like it if Paul could come and tell you there's no problem that is uncommon come on snap out of that rubbish uhuh you need such voices sometimes it may sound offensive but it will jolt you to reality and when we tell you that we will had it also for you that but God is faithful who will not tempt you above what the the faithfulness of God is such that it doesn't tempt above the capacity of us so if God allow you to go through anything is because he and chest out on your behalf like he did for job have you considered my servant job of all my house righteous integrity and everything and did job disappoint him the power not to disappoint has already been put in there look those things are in you God has put it in there allow it amen allow it to come out take advantage prise God don't look into your problems look full in the wonderful face of God Joseph may not be able to explain all things but he knew that all these things is working for his good then when God looked at he had stayed too long in the house of pitifer it stayed enough time he created adversary through the wife of portier and they told lie on him and nobody could plead the cause of an helpless servant and but you see it was God's part again each part was very adverse are you catching that but it was bringing him nearer to the Fulfillment of the vision so the revealed with of God was what he was going to become the unrevealed one was how he was going to become it amen but is God to trust God each step of the way they put in prison but I tell you even though Joseph couldn't explain why it's Calamity upon Calamity he never lost himself he ped himself together he remained positive until the controller of prison said ah there's something about this guy am you see do you know that Christians are the people who live not with a fake facade but with a genuine continent like they have no problem amen you know why they've cast their heavy burdens he said they took it to the Lord and did what leave it there they don't take it there and take it back it will be too heavy a load so they rolled it they drop it there and they went home free and you ask them about their challenges is at the feet of the Cross that's why they can retain their Peace uhhuh So Joseph looked great again and they control up this something about this guy said you know what you are the defacto controller of prison now and let me warn you there's no jail break here you will account for every guy in this place so Joseph became the de facto controller and the pastor of the group of the entire prison let me go all the while with a song and a smile fill my way every day with your love amen nothing could disintegrate his person I like characters like this if I want the model these are my models friends they did this before the cross how much more after the cross they did this when they do not have the Holy Ghost as a possession but just as an inspiration how much more you that have the right the benefit of receiving Holy Ghost inside of you and you will tell me the quality of life will be lower than that tell somebody else am I jolting you to reality that some of the things that you know we have to prod and beg and push us about it shows the quality if before the cross this BR were this Gallant go read Hebrews 11 great Saints many lived before the cross and I tell you it was a balanced report as it was much for the men so was it much for the women and you were expecting to go to the same Heaven they went come and tap into your grace and live better than you are doing praise God Amen I'm winding down but get this quickly all right and then Joseph became the controller again because his person was not disintegrated there is no challenge no problem that could break him that's what I'm telling you you say is it possible I'm giving you evidence show me otherwise what we need is not to be looking for is it possible With God all things are tap into the grace that makes it possible amen I'm raising your faith level and I'm challenging your faith and one day Joseph saw two of his uh church members the ejected maybe they didn't come for prison fellowship amen and uh he he went to look for them and he saw the two of them dejected having conversation between themselves said brethren we didn't see you at the prison fellowship what was going on here sir I saw a dream and I saw a dream okay tell us your dream my dream says uh I was uh you know he said his own the butler said his own he said okay and you Baker this is my my dream ah said brother Baker God be with you till we meet again you aren't going to come out of this Pharaoh will kill you he said but brother Butler you're going to be restored back to the White House you will serve the president again am and he said please when you get back remember me amen as a man Joseph pleaded for assistance but let me tell you if the assistance came at that time it will be an alteration to the vision am did you catch that look some of you looked up to some people sometimes you looked up to your uncles even to your parents to somebody who you feel it so connected and it could have made things happen for you if they are not part of the vision it's not going to work you see Christians must Rise Above This uh sentiment of attachment your greatest connector is the Lord Jesus Christ himself he must be the one to take glory in all your circumstance if that person couldn't do it don't have no issue against any man don't be bitter against nobody it's because they were not part of the vision God will not walk outside of his vision his program for your life because you are thought expressed so Those whom you have held in your heart go and release them it's not necessary it's not necessary they will hinder you from making it they will hinder you from making it here and making it in glory because if you have what against anybody you are walking over the dangers of Hell Fire release them how many will promise to release them oh releasing them the botler went back to the White House he went back to the throne and as he got back God took away the memory it wasn't natural for you to have related with a person for so long in the prison and he was the one that even gave the prophecy of your deliverance huh and you expect you will get back to your office and forget him is it natural it's not possible their event their meeting was not a chance meeting they have a relationship and the man go back to the throne and he didn't remember Joseph no for one day it was the Lord's working he took it out you know why God doesn't want nobody to share his glory over Joseph he doesn't want he doesn't want he doesn't want Joseph being brought out of pity amen and somebody will say if not for me say again I should say it again all right he doesn't want Joseph being brought out of pity so that somebody will say come on keep quiet if not for me it will always be even not for God he want Joseph brought out of necessity amen when it will become so necessary instead of we preing him we are the one that needs his messy now he wants him to come out out of Honor so he wiped up the memory and everything seemed to continue the man was busy with his work and they were enjoying themselves with the King then one day in God's appointed season according to the vision you see how your life is working now ahuh is a story of your life I'm telling you in God's appointed season according to the vision God went to the king of Egypt he had a dream the dream look so simple Brethren but when God is ready to single you out for honor it makes everybody looks foolish around here so that is why you must not take glory for anything you must always say thank God huh huh all right God bless you so they saw the he saw the dream nobody could help him the King was becoming frustrated helpless and an appless and in the process he was getting mad deciding to deal with the people and maybe the uncle of the botler is one of the people to be dealt with everybody was wondering what would happen then God said now it's time then God just blew the braid and he said sister Nami how could I have forgotten ah how would I face Pastor Joseph now this many years have been restored to my position and I didn't remember Pastor exist oh God oh God but nevertheless uh better L than never he went to the king he said you know what all this problem we are having that is creating tension in government in the nation is a simple problem so you know that all along and you are allowing us to go into the no it's not about me it's about uh one man said where is he he a prisoner who is a immigrant ah Pharaoh said get next to yourself I'm we are talking of serious national issue you are talking about hey you better take it serious in this our dark time this is the only man who can turn on the light if you really want light let's go get this man ah there's a man who can turn on the [Applause] he said okay okay okay okay let's go get him they went to the prison Brother Joseph took him for grooming nice appearance looking great and sharp and he came before the king ah welcome Mr Joseph I was told you can solve our problem said no sir I can't solve no problem if he was a man who has been dejected and disappointed in God will he check the king on the glory he was going to give him he checked him he said no it's only god of Heaven who I serve before Pharaoh Joseph was testifying about God who had taken him through all those challenges that speaks volume of his relationship little light Affliction some of you don't come to church again you don't read your Bible you don't want to pray again how will your testimony stand before Joseph do you know the span of years he went through all these challenges and yet nothing could break him because he's God God he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world is greater than that problem he greater than that challenge they can't submerge you because you got the great God and by the great God you got Greater Grace Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that is greater he saidh there's a God who can do that said yeah the god of Heaven whom I serve will deal with your matter explain your matter when he explained Joseph you all know the story Joseph gave all the explanation the interpretation and Pharaoh was so pleased then he said what is the solution God gave the interpretation he gave the solution mhm any Vision any Prophet that is in your problem but is not offering solution is a counterfeit Prophet oh yes especially you Africans who love your prophets they will always tell you who is undoing you but they will never show you how to come on they only playing on your on your emotions you know the devil DS with a man the way his mind runs they know what will exite you and they are giving it to you in tongs shame on the devil this morning amen amen amen he gave them the interpretation he gave them solution and he said let a man be appointed to take care of all this business Pharaoh laughed I said let a man be appointed who is the man with whom is the spirit of God like this that can handle this matter or that this Joseph are you all listening to me Joseph you are the man from today amen you take over amen you are the prime Minister he removed his ring he gave it to him from prison to the throne amen he said it is only in the throne that I'll be your Superior you take charge of everything thus say the Lord can never fail the vision is for an appointed time and I can see the years of plenty finishing and I can see the years of him in coming and I can see Jacob telling the brother we learned that a great Revival is going on in Egypt there's a mighty prince in Egypt who is turning things around go to him maybe we can find favor and Jacob never knew Israel never knew that was his own son and I can see the brothers came and they said before as they came god with their eyes and he opened the eyes of Joseph and they saw that these were his brothers he said you know these guys they are not ordinary buyers customers send them in to come and do their transaction then they told them you must deal with the prince of the land for this your transaction because it's just the protocol it's a special a presidential order and there's nothing we can do about are you ready to face he said what did we do don't take us to the Prime Minister what did we do said you must come and as they came I can see them fell down flat did they bow on us did they bow or not am can you Stamper with the vision no way it came to pass not one time not two times I counted about five times you say maybe it was when they didn't know it was Joseph let me take you further after Joseph had revealed himself amen and there seemed to be no problem again and their father died they said they became afraid they said H it was our father that gave us favor before Joseph that's why he didn't destroy us but now that they our father has died Joseph will now visit you see if you are wrong if you if you if you are doing wrong and you didn't make it right properly the guilt of sin will never leave you when you make it right properly the devil will still want to call you on it but tell him old Satan say my Lord was gone and will not hear my prayer but thanks be to God the work is done if you make your way right properly the blood avails automatically you don't need an audible voice to tell you you already forgiven accept your pardon and rise above it but this Breen couldn't just come out of it so the Bible said they came together they formed Society of guilty brothers and came again now knowing Joseph and come to beg for their life and the Bible say when they came they did what again they bowed amen thus say the Lord amen can never fail they bowed according to the dreams of Joseph they fell before him flatly and Joseph became their provider through to the blessing of Birthright the nourisher of their lives until the seasons of faming were over Joseph relocated them to Egypt in order to fulfill the larger promise of the word so there's always a large picture which other subsections of pictures must bring together in order for the expected end that God desires will be achieved that is the story of your life God bless you God bless you thank you fear not Little Flock whatever your lord he ENT all rooms there give us from the second stanza let's start
