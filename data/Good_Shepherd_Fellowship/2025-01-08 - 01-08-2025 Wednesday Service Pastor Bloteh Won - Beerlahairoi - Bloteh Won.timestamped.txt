[1:01:44] read from the book of Genesis thank you
[1:01:47] brother
[1:01:48] AR and uh
[1:02:07] praise the
[1:02:09] Lord amen amen
[1:02:19] amen that would be Genesis 21
[1:02:27] if I'm
[1:02:47] right praise the Lord
[1:02:59] Genesis 21 Let's
[1:03:01] uh read from verse
[1:03:11] 9 I was listening to message some time
[1:03:14] ago and brother B says
[1:03:17] something in line with this chapter I
[1:03:20] just I just want to share that with you
[1:03:22] tonight on this prayer meeting
[1:03:26] Genesis 21 let's read from verse 9 and
[1:03:29] Sarah saw the uh the son of haga the
[1:03:33] Egyptian which she had born unto Abraham
[1:03:38] Morgan
[1:03:40] wherefore she said unto
[1:03:42] Abraham cast out this bound woman and
[1:03:46] her
[1:03:47] son for the son of this bound woman
[1:03:50] shall not be hiss with my son even I
[1:03:56] ISAC you realize that Paul used that
[1:04:00] that particular statement in Galatians
[1:04:02] chapter 4 he use it exactly the way
[1:04:05] Sarah said it praise the Lord now that's
[1:04:09] a reason why there's a reason why I I I
[1:04:11] said that wherefore let's read that
[1:04:15] again she said unto Abraham Sarah said
[1:04:18] unto Abraham cast out this bound woman
[1:04:21] and her son for the son of this bound
[1:04:24] woman shall never be with my son even
[1:04:28] with Isaac and the thing was very
[1:04:31] Grievous in Abraham's sight because of
[1:04:35] his son ishmail was his son and God said
[1:04:39] unto
[1:04:41] Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy
[1:04:44] sight because of the
[1:04:48] lead and because of the bound
[1:04:51] woman in all that Sarah have said unto
[1:04:56] thee Ying unto her voice for in Isaac
[1:05:02] shall their seed be called Praise the
[1:05:05] Lord now I believe is because the Lord
[1:05:09] is telling Abraham here listening to
[1:05:13] what Sarah said I believe that's the
[1:05:15] reason why the Apostle Paul took that as
[1:05:19] a word of God and he repeated exactly
[1:05:23] what Sarah said because God is coming
[1:05:27] down and says don't be
[1:05:28] Grievous you do exactly what Sarah said
[1:05:32] let's read on the little
[1:05:35] bit verse 13 and also of the son of the
[1:05:40] bound woman will I make a nation because
[1:05:44] he is thy seed and Abraham rose up early
[1:05:48] in the morning and took bread and a
[1:05:51] bottle of water and gave it unto hear
[1:05:55] putting it in I mean putting it on her
[1:05:58] shoulder and the child and send her
[1:06:03] away and she
[1:06:06] departed and wandered in the wilderness
[1:06:09] of Bel
[1:06:10] Sheba and the water was spin in the
[1:06:15] bottle and she cast the child on one of
[1:06:21] the stra and she went and and and sat
[1:06:25] her down over against him a good way
[1:06:30] off which mean she sat down looking at
[1:06:33] him but she was away from him a good way
[1:06:36] of as it
[1:06:39] were a bll

[1:10:57] water was dried and she lie it down and
[1:11:02] started
[1:11:03] on and the little fellow streaming for
[1:11:07] water and he got weaker and
[1:11:11] weaker and heard only CH now this is
[1:11:16] what caught my my mind before we go for
[1:11:20] you brother brandom said he was talking
[1:11:23] about being Miss
[1:11:26] understood being Mis judge amen he says
[1:11:31] of her being right in the landine of
[1:11:34] Duty praise the Lord Sarah was the one
[1:11:38] that took her as a
[1:11:41] maid are we together Sarah was the one
[1:11:45] that came up with the suggestion of
[1:11:49] producing the promised son I can't have
[1:11:51] a son take my M to have the son
[1:11:55] praise the Lord it was not hael that was
[1:12:00] uh misbehaving herself around Abraham it
[1:12:03] was Sarah that brought the
[1:12:06] suggestion praise the Lord now see what
[1:12:09] brother Brandon is saying now she was
[1:12:11] right in the line of
[1:12:13] duty are we together amen and Y said she
[1:12:19] was Miss
[1:12:20] Jorge why Sarah is is is you know
[1:12:23] waiting on on uh uh having the son now
[1:12:27] now uh hear is having her son maybe she
[1:12:31] playing with her son and calling him
[1:12:33] names and and and and Sarah feeling bad
[1:12:36] she misjudged the
[1:12:38] situation and she said castle
[1:12:44] out praise the
[1:12:46] Lord are we together now brother Brandon
[1:12:49] will go down we will read a little bit
[1:12:52] down he will go down and he will bring
[1:12:54] this talk in the sense of how do we
[1:12:59] handle when we are misjudged by
[1:13:03] people when we think we are
[1:13:06] misunderstood what do we
[1:13:09] do praise the Lord and it's something
[1:13:12] that we all deal with one way or
[1:13:15] another whether it's husband or wife
[1:13:17] whether it is uh children and parent
[1:13:20] whether it is uh the assembly and the
[1:13:22] pastor the pastor and the people what
[1:13:25] whether it's our co-workers
[1:13:27] misunderstanding is something that we
[1:13:29] deal with all of the time but how do we
[1:13:32] handle
[1:13:35] it praise the
[1:13:38] Lord how do we handle it there is
[1:13:42] nothing she will say that will matter at
[1:13:44] that
[1:13:46] time the scripture says Sarah said that
[1:13:50] she was mogging her that was Sarah
[1:13:52] thought of the of what was going on but
[1:13:55] was she really mogging Sarah was she
[1:13:58] doing that to get to Sarah or Sarah was
[1:14:01] just dealing with her own
[1:14:06] complex praise the Lord now what I want
[1:14:10] us to realize is that prophecy is
[1:14:13] hanging over these
[1:14:16] people this whole thing is going to is
[1:14:19] going to give birth to a prophecy where
[1:14:22] the Apostle Paul would take in the book
[1:14:24] of of Galan and make us to know what is
[1:14:27] the bound woman and what is the free
[1:14:31] woman this is prophecy that is playing
[1:14:34] out even though they are living their
[1:14:37] their their their normal
[1:14:40] life they are living their normal life
[1:14:45] but God is playing prophecy in their
[1:14:50] life praise the Lord God is playing
[1:14:54] things in their life like brother
[1:14:56] brandom said in the chrisis The Mystery
[1:14:57] of God reveal he says Those Old
[1:14:59] Testament characters never knew that God
[1:15:02] was was playing out prophecy in their
[1:15:05] life they were living their normal life
[1:15:08] but God was the one turning the wheels
[1:15:11] of
[1:15:13] Prophecy how do we deal with
[1:15:18] misunderstanding how do we deal when you
[1:15:21] feel that you are misjudged
[1:15:28] praise the Lord
[1:15:31] amen that's that's what caught my
[1:15:34] attention I was I was I was listening to
[1:15:37] the statement I think I was doing
[1:15:38] something in and when the prophet God
[1:15:40] said that I I pay close attention to
[1:15:43] this
[1:15:44] because uh uh I realize even as myself
[1:15:48] sometimes you are misunderstood and
[1:15:49] sometimes I misunderstand
[1:15:52] people there it's something that you
[1:15:54] Cann you cannot do
[1:15:57] without you are either misunderstood or
[1:16:00] you misunderstand
[1:16:02] people if you think that you don't
[1:16:05] misunderstand people then I mean you
[1:16:06] have to come to the
[1:16:08] reality that you are a human amen you
[1:16:12] are born in a failing body your mind do
[1:16:14] not serve you right all the
[1:16:19] time praise the Lord the prophet of God
[1:16:22] will call it right in the line of Duty
[1:16:25] which mean she's doing what she was told
[1:16:28] to
[1:16:29] do she's not breaking the
[1:16:33] word amen because many times when we
[1:16:37] talk about the character of hegar we we
[1:16:39] just we just sometimes just talk about
[1:16:42] this Egyptian woman that came over to uh
[1:16:45] to Abraham house she was a servant I
[1:16:47] mean she did not force herself on
[1:16:49] Abraham this was all Sarah
[1:16:53] idea praise the
[1:16:57] Lord sometimes the things that we we
[1:16:59] think are right I mean because we are so
[1:17:02] finished and we are so
[1:17:04] limited there is no provision in our
[1:17:07] mind for the future because we don't
[1:17:09] foresee it until God reveal it to
[1:17:12] us for the moment we think that whatever
[1:17:16] we are seeing whatever we are thinking
[1:17:18] we think that is the right
[1:17:21] thing praise the Lord it was God that
[1:17:24] made the promise it was God that gave
[1:17:27] the promise to
[1:17:28] Abraham that through your seed I'll make
[1:17:32] you the father of Nations it was not
[1:17:34] Sarah that that made the promise but
[1:17:37] because she was included in the promise
[1:17:40] and she did not have the patience to
[1:17:43] wait on the promise she H breeded The
[1:17:47] Promise by bringing in this Egyptian
[1:17:52] woman praise the Lord
[1:17:55] amen the seed is now held with the Shar
[1:17:58] brother Brandon will take from Galatians
[1:18:01] and include uh uh uh he will include uh
[1:18:07] uh how do we call it now hagga Sarah and
[1:18:12] Mary talking about bringing the promised
[1:18:16] son so hega came in as an
[1:18:19] interruption but her place was
[1:18:23] necessary amen
[1:18:26] even though it looks like an
[1:18:27] interruption but her place was
[1:18:33] necessary are we together let's go down
[1:18:37] a little bit here it's a beautiful story
[1:18:41] because if you realize in the reading of
[1:18:44] the scripture the Bible says she laid a
[1:18:46] child she went out and and and and she
[1:18:49] sat back and she started crying I mean
[1:18:51] as a mother her heart was broken
[1:18:54] but when God will hear from heaven and
[1:18:58] God will respond to her cry God will not
[1:19:01] say I have heard your cry he said I have
[1:19:04] heard the CED of the Lamb why because
[1:19:07] that was the Seed of
[1:19:12] Abraham praise the Lord amen thou was a
[1:19:16] Seed of
[1:19:19] Abraham and like brother Brandon would
[1:19:21] say to us that is the natural Instinct
[1:19:25] that God plac in his children that's the
[1:19:28] Natural Instinct that God plac in every
[1:19:30] child to want something and cry for
[1:19:34] it praise the Lord amen sometimes I do
[1:19:38] forget because I I tell my daughter do
[1:19:41] you have to cry for something to get it
[1:19:44] but it's the Natural Instinct that's the
[1:19:46] way that God designed them they have to
[1:19:48] cry to be able to
[1:19:50] get praise the Lord until they can be
[1:19:54] able to grow and and that's the way that
[1:19:56] God designed us that's the way he
[1:19:59] designed
[1:20:01] us sometimes you realize that uh uh uh
[1:20:05] uh
[1:20:08] uh when when when uh when when when
[1:20:11] things are bothering you or you you are
[1:20:13] really in their channel of of praying I
[1:20:17] don't know about you but uh many times
[1:20:20] uh I feel like uh uh uh uh you get in
[1:20:24] that place of
[1:20:25] Brokenness amen for you to really be
[1:20:29] able to get out of your flesh and get in
[1:20:31] the spirit of worship and get in the
[1:20:33] spirit of prayer you got to get in the
[1:20:36] place of
[1:20:37] Brokenness I almost feel like you are
[1:20:40] breaking away from the Flesh and
[1:20:42] breaking into the spirit and and when
[1:20:44] you get in the place of Brokenness
[1:20:46] sometimes you don't even able to alter
[1:20:48] your words all you do you just
[1:20:53] cry that's that's the way that God
[1:20:55] designed us I think he listen to our cry
[1:20:59] more than much of the things that we say
[1:21:02] because when we cry out to God a Al of
[1:21:06] things just like Paul says we in ourself
[1:21:09] we don't know how to pray he says it's
[1:21:11] the spirit that make it
[1:21:13] utterance so sometimes cry brings out
[1:21:17] the dep thing from your spirit the thing
[1:21:20] that your mouth is not really able to
[1:21:22] express to God some times when you cry
[1:21:26] your tears expresses
[1:21:30] it praise the Lord
[1:21:39] amen he says here he says no doubt but
[1:21:43] what her innocent heart will cry out oh
[1:21:46] God I have done wrong what have I done
[1:21:50] and she couldn't stand to see the child
[1:21:52] die in her arm so she laid him on a bush
[1:21:57] and she went about a board shot just
[1:22:00] like a b and Irish shot a distance away
[1:22:03] and uh uh probably a 100 years or more
[1:22:09] and seeing a little tree and she nail
[1:22:12] down she nailed down and there she
[1:22:15] begins to
[1:22:17] weep she can't explain it she can't put
[1:22:19] it into words what have I got myself
[1:22:23] into I have a life on my
[1:22:27] hands if if it were just me alone I
[1:22:30] won't mind I just I just travel I mean
[1:22:32] if I meet people that that kill me
[1:22:34] that's okay but this child this innocent
[1:22:38] child praise the Lord now you can also
[1:22:41] see that in the contrary she could think
[1:22:45] that how
[1:22:47] crel could s
[1:22:50] be react and reaction to being
[1:22:56] misunderstood what have I done even if I
[1:22:59] have done anything to her why couldn't
[1:23:01] she think about this
[1:23:04] child why couldn't she take the child
[1:23:07] and just ask me to
[1:23:10] go how do we how do we handle
[1:23:16] misunderstanding when we are misunder to
[1:23:19] how do we handle it
[1:23:24] praise the
[1:23:38] Lord for she wonder
[1:23:42] why if she did what was
[1:23:45] right why should this thing come upon
[1:23:48] her many times we think that in our
[1:23:52] sickness in affliction see but may maybe
[1:23:57] it's all done to show the grace and the
[1:24:00] mercy of God and exactly what was
[1:24:02] happening is because they were under
[1:24:05] prophecy she couldn't understand that
[1:24:08] she was fulfilling
[1:24:10] prophecy praise the Lord she couldn't
[1:24:14] understand it that she were fulfilling
[1:24:17] prophecy Sarah herself could also could
[1:24:19] Now understand how did she ever came to
[1:24:22] the place I mean for her to gave this
[1:24:25] girl to Abraham means that among all her
[1:24:30] servants this was the one that she love
[1:24:32] love the
[1:24:34] most just like how Ela was to Abraham
[1:24:38] that's the same way hagga was to
[1:24:42] sarum praise the Lord she had other
[1:24:46] female servant but for her to take this
[1:24:48] girl and give her to her husband close
[1:24:53] her matrimonial door and go and sit down
[1:24:55] and say maybe Sarah will bring the one I
[1:24:58] mean haga will be the one to bring us
[1:25:00] the child that we need this was somebody
[1:25:03] that she loved how could she go from
[1:25:06] that place of loving this person to not
[1:25:10] want to even see her
[1:25:11] again
[1:25:13] how how do we go from those places in
[1:25:16] our
[1:25:17] life what
[1:25:21] happened praise the Lord
[1:25:28] misunderstanding and there is a big
[1:25:31] picture and she can even see the big
[1:25:34] picture she don't have no idea of the
[1:25:36] big picture she's just looking at what
[1:25:39] is happening
[1:25:41] now what will all the servants in the
[1:25:43] house
[1:25:45] say I realize when I come out of the
[1:25:48] room everybody eyes is just looking at
[1:25:51] me praise the Lord
[1:25:56] her complex is ministering to her her
[1:25:59] complex is saying thousand different
[1:26:01] words to her in her
[1:26:07] mind and she slammed the door as soon as
[1:26:11] I enter the house she slammed the door
[1:26:12] maybe the girl was not even thinking
[1:26:15] about maybe she never even knew Sarah
[1:26:18] was
[1:26:21] coming she's now interpreting every
[1:26:24] everything that is
[1:26:26] happening
[1:26:28] everything oh how the devil love to get
[1:26:31] us in that spot how he loveed to get us
[1:26:35] right in that spot that's the place
[1:26:38] where the devil can do the greatest
[1:26:41] robbery that he can ever do to a man is
[1:26:45] to get him in the place of
[1:26:47] misunderstanding
[1:26:58] praise the
[1:26:59] Lord I know I know for trueth I know
[1:27:03] Abraham I mean it was just night after
[1:27:06] night as soon as Abraham comes comes
[1:27:10] from in the field that's the that's the
[1:27:11] first thing that he's greeted
[1:27:13] with and not a
[1:27:18] complain I can even have peace in my
[1:27:21] home I'm no longer the Mistress of this
[1:27:32] home glory be to
[1:27:35] God you love the
[1:27:39] Lord how do we miss deal with
[1:27:43] misunderstanding how do we deal when we
[1:27:45] are
[1:27:49] misjudged praise the
[1:27:51] Lord many times we Fe right into
[1:27:56] it we feed right into it and then we
[1:27:59] starts to fire back that's the way the
[1:28:02] flesh will deal with
[1:28:04] it that's the way the human nature would
[1:28:06] deal with
[1:28:09] it we Fe right into it and we start to
[1:28:12] fire back there's not much she could do
[1:28:15] here because
[1:28:18] Abraham is going to listen to his wife
[1:28:21] by an order from the Lord
[1:28:28] God is going to order him listen to
[1:28:31] Sarah and put that woman
[1:28:36] away if sometimes we will just only
[1:28:40] realize we'll just realize some of the
[1:28:43] things that is
[1:28:46] happening in the word in the r behind
[1:28:50] us praise the Lord if we were just
[1:28:54] realize that some of the things that uh
[1:28:56] that we encounter that we deal with it
[1:28:59] just have so little to do with
[1:29:03] us praise the Lord it just have so
[1:29:07] little it's just because God may you
[1:29:10] allow you to be born allow you to grow
[1:29:13] up he gave you Grace for you to be saved
[1:29:16] and now he's trusting you that by the
[1:29:19] knowledge of his word that you have
[1:29:21] learned you will you will you will
[1:29:23] compose yourself as a Son of God or
[1:29:25] compose yourself at a as a daughter of
[1:29:28] God in a
[1:29:31] moment sometimes it does not have much
[1:29:33] to do with
[1:29:35] us did everything that job went through
[1:29:38] does it have to do with him
[1:29:42] no it does not have anything to do with
[1:29:45] job and his attitude it had to do with a
[1:29:49] God that made us for his
[1:29:52] pleasure and want to do with us whatever
[1:29:55] it pleases
[1:29:57] him and sometime we behave as if we have
[1:30:00] the stearing wheel in our hands and we
[1:30:03] can do whatever we want to do but you
[1:30:05] missing the picture because your sight
[1:30:08] is so
[1:30:10] short praise the Lord your sight is so
[1:30:15] short that she ever realize in her
[1:30:20] lifetime that an angel of the Lord will
[1:30:23] speak to her
[1:30:24] if she never had this situation she
[1:30:27] would never had an Angelic
[1:30:33] visitation praise the Lord she sat there
[1:30:36] many times in the house and she heard
[1:30:39] Abraham saying the Lord said to me the
[1:30:41] Lord said to him I wonder how God speak
[1:30:44] to him she's singing I wonder how God
[1:30:47] speak to him you remember Abraham always
[1:30:49] say this thing God the Lord speak to him
[1:30:51] how do God speak to him
[1:30:54] I wonder is just his
[1:30:56] imagination is it a
[1:30:58] dream if she never had that experience
[1:31:02] she would never had Angelic
[1:31:07] visitation and some things that God
[1:31:09] allowed in our life is to give us
[1:31:12] Angelic
[1:31:13] visitation praise the
[1:31:17] Lord is to give us Angelic visitation

[1:32:36] God doing with our
[1:32:39] life or he just placed us here for us to
[1:32:42] fight our way through
[1:32:50] things and to just prove to these people
[1:32:52] that nobody I'm not stupid
[1:33:01] praise the
[1:33:06] Lord you know the story one time
[1:33:10] David he was there in that land and the
[1:33:12] people realized it says this is the man
[1:33:15] that that that that that they were all
[1:33:16] singing about David K 10,000 this man if
[1:33:19] we allow him to be here he's he's
[1:33:21] aspired for the Israelite
[1:33:24] this one this man was
[1:33:26] anointed the prophet Samuel had anointed
[1:33:30] him but the Bible said David had to play
[1:33:34] the
[1:33:35] food he had to lay it on the street like
[1:33:38] a mad
[1:33:39] man he tore his clothes he allowed spit
[1:33:42] to be coming from his
[1:33:46] mouth because he wanted to preserve his
[1:33:49] life if he wanted to prove that he's a
[1:33:52] king and nobody would think I'm stupid
[1:33:54] they were going to kill
[1:34:02] him praise the
[1:34:05] Lord
[1:34:08] amen like one of my friend told me over

[1:34:32] you don't slow time slow down you'll die
[1:34:34] for Your
[1:34:37] Right sometimes people that that are
[1:34:40] hate in accident is not because they
[1:34:42] were
[1:34:47] wrong it's because they were trying to
[1:34:49] prove that they were right so sometimes
[1:34:51] you allow your right goal or else you
[1:34:54] would die for your
[1:34:59] right how do we deal with
[1:35:02] misunderstanding and sometimes that's
[1:35:04] the thing that flaws our mind how do

[1:35:09] me what would they say about me how do
[1:35:12] that
[1:35:14] matter how do that

[1:36:18] Lord Oh my he God misunderstood yet in
[1:36:23] the L of Duty misunderstood miss judge
[1:36:27] and she was even cast
[1:36:32] out and it was not her
[1:36:36] fault it was not her
[1:36:47] fault glory be to
[1:36:50] God Amen
[1:36:54] oh
[1:37:11] my I was trying to see back here that
[1:37:15] trying to look for the day you just to
[1:37:17] share with you uh how many months I've
[1:37:20] I've I've just I've just taught on this
[1:37:22] constantly
[1:37:24] just been dwelling on my mind because
[1:37:26] tonight was a prayer meeting actually
[1:37:29] brother ER was supposed to speak but we
[1:37:31] kind of for change the order of the
[1:37:32] service tonight so I just said okay I
[1:37:35] just I just share this thing with the
[1:37:36] church tonight and uh uh let's just read
[1:37:39] on a little bit here we're so
[1:37:46] close many times we think that our
[1:37:49] sickness and and and and AFF flection
[1:37:51] seed but maybe it's all
[1:37:54] done to show grace and
[1:37:58] mercy and while she Tau she
[1:38:03] heard the little fainted cry that they
[1:38:06] finally FedEd out for
[1:38:11] water she heard a voice speak and said
[1:38:16] why weepeth
[1:38:18] down I I I would believe in my mind that
[1:38:22] uh that's hear her to
[1:38:26] death when she heard the voice of the
[1:38:28] Lord or the voice of the angel I will
[1:38:31] believe that that's that's scar her to
[1:38:33] death she even forgot about her
[1:38:37] child maybe she Rose in the place of
[1:38:41] Defense just like Joshua stood before
[1:38:44] the angel and said are you with us or
[1:38:46] are you against us she might have Rose
[1:38:49] to a place of defense and looking
[1:38:52] looking around and says who's
[1:38:54] that trying to look for a stick on the
[1:38:57] ground or anything to protect
[1:39:03] herself but if you realize the question
[1:39:06] was not attacking her the question was
[1:39:09] to help
[1:39:11] her amen the question that the angel
[1:39:15] asked was to help her why weepth
[1:39:20] down why you want to take uh something
[1:39:23] to defend yourself against somebody that
[1:39:25] want to help
[1:39:27] you but sometimes you see when Mis
[1:39:31] understanding make us to build complex
[1:39:33] in our
[1:39:35] life it's hard for us to even see help
[1:39:38] when help is on the way
[1:39:57] praise the
[1:40:00] Lord here say she's
[1:40:03] having the greater
[1:40:06] experience that any
[1:40:08] mortal could
[1:40:10] have to hear the voice of the
[1:40:14] Lord or hear the voice of the Angel of
[1:40:18] the
[1:40:19] Lord she's having the greater experience
[1:40:23] that any
[1:40:24] morar will be able to
[1:40:28] have but you see her
[1:40:30] complex in her with the
[1:40:35] rejection the misjudgment of Sarah and
[1:40:38] everything that she have done I mean all
[1:40:41] down the road she was walking she was
[1:40:43] she was not praying she was just talking
[1:40:45] to herself in her head what she think
[1:40:47] she
[1:40:48] is I mean she talk talk talk until she
[1:40:51] realized there is no more water
[1:40:57] that's what we do sometimes we just
[1:40:59] complain we just I mean we just thr
[1:41:01] faith and just do everything when we
[1:41:04] don't even have nothing behind us to
[1:41:06] help
[1:41:13] us and realize realize now God waited
[1:41:19] until she
[1:41:21] came to the place
[1:41:24] word the water is
[1:41:27] gone she might have stay days there is
[1:41:31] no breast milk to breast the baby she
[1:41:33] don't have anything to
[1:41:36] eat because with all those thing that
[1:41:39] she have if God will have come in that
[1:41:42] moment she would not even listen she
[1:41:44] might even be running away from that
[1:41:46] voice that is trying to help
[1:41:50] her but she he waited until she came to
[1:41:55] her place of
[1:41:56] need she came to a place of
[1:42:04] desperation praise the
[1:42:09] Lord that's my exhortation to you
