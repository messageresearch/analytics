[36:34] the Lord bless you you may have your
[36:37] seat so by the word of uh a title we can
[36:41] title this tonight uh uh uh the great
[36:44] woman part two and what I want to do
[36:47] tonight is there a uh I want to I want
[36:51] to run a parallel tonight if if uh if
[36:56] the if as the Lord will help me tonight
[36:59] and and then in doing that we can be
[37:01] able to look at few history and we can
[37:04] be able to look at few of the things
[37:06] that is happening in our midst now we
[37:09] were talking about we've been speaking
[37:10] about that great woman jessibel and uh
[37:14] uh and her influence on on Sunday we
[37:17] talk about her being a great woman in
[37:20] Revelation chapter 18 it talk about uh
[37:24] uh um the uh Mr Babylon the great and uh
[37:30] so but y said where where my mind is
[37:34] tonight and and and I want for us to
[37:36] look at in a parallel is
[37:40] how uh that woman jessibel and Babylon
[37:45] relates amen I want us to look at how
[37:49] the woman jessibel and Babylon relates
[37:53] now the the the scripture talks about uh
[37:56] you know a Babylon and a liking Babylon
[38:00] onto uh that that that woman Babylon you
[38:03] know that great Babylon you know and and
[38:06] when you read right there it starts to
[38:08] talk about how she and all the things
[38:10] that she has done now it's is all of
[38:13] that is is because of the place of a
[38:16] woman in the scripture you know she's uh
[38:20] uh she has she has a special place to
[38:23] with with God and and that was the
[38:25] reason why when God made a woman he put
[38:29] the man to sleep is because of some of
[38:31] the the the values that she has you know
[38:35] and she was giving the promise of
[38:36] redemption as we have said before but so
[38:39] tonight we want to run a parallel to see
[38:43] that there is there is there is a
[38:46] connection between Babylon and that
[38:49] woman Jezebel and there is a connection
[38:52] between the New Jerusalem and the bride
[38:59] amen so that's that's what we want to we
[39:01] want to be able to look out for the few
[39:03] minutes that is before us now see here
[39:06] the Bible says that we have just read in
[39:09] uh in Matthew
[39:12] chapter chapter
[39:14] 5
[39:16] uh the the the the scripture says that
[39:21] uh
[39:23] um you are the light of the word a
[39:28] city that is set on a hill that cannot
[39:33] be hid amen that you are a
[39:36] city praise the Lord that you are a city
[39:41] so we seeing here that uh the city
[39:47] Babylon which uh became uh uh uh a
[39:52] civilization After the flood and we know
[39:55] where where were near buil and there was
[39:58] a system that was built and and and in
[40:03] uh uh in a religion and and all of that
[40:06] a form of worship that was contrary to
[40:09] uh to the worship that Noah and his sons
[40:12] had which of course they came through
[40:14] the flood you know they were the one
[40:16] that God deed with but then we see that
[40:19] but then uh through through the through
[40:21] the history Through the Ages we see
[40:24] there are very system there are very
[40:26] system of Nero going down through the
[40:29] lineage of uh of uh uh uh Abraham and
[40:36] his seed and they have to deal with all
[40:39] of that they came out of that place uh
[40:41] uh uh Canan the amorites and all of
[40:44] those nations came out of you know that
[40:48] great Babylon and and and and there was
[40:50] a man also that came out of Babylon his
[40:53] father
[40:55] Abraham he came out of Babylon that's
[40:58] where his father came out of but from
[41:01] this
[41:02] man God will make a covenant God will
[41:07] start once again approaching the heart
[41:10] of man God once again will start
[41:13] speaking to the conscience of
[41:16] man and God start dealing with Abraham
[41:21] and he has have to call him out he has
[41:24] to come out of that system of Babylon
[41:27] and then we see down Through the Ages as
[41:30] we as we'll realize a Seed of
[41:35] Abraham bought the land from the
[41:39] jebusites which is now called
[41:42] Jerusalem and David make that place a
[41:47] special
[41:49] place he called it Zion he makes it his
[41:55] capital and and then we realize that the
[41:58] eyes of God says watching over that
[42:01] place and watching over that
[42:04] people are we
[42:07] together now so there's a parallel here
[42:10] that's that's what we want to look at
[42:12] Babylon and
[42:15] Jezebel Jerusalem and the
[42:19] bride are we together amen now look at
[42:24] Revelation chapter
[42:27] 21 let's look at Revelation chapter 21 a
[42:30] little bit
[42:32] here and
[42:38] uh because when we look through all of
[42:41] this we will want to see that uh uh just
[42:45] like how God brought Abraham
[42:49] father and Abraham formally out of
[42:53] Babylon and God started dealing with
[42:55] Abraham
[42:56] for him to become a Hebrew for a race to
[43:00] come out of out of Abraham called h h h
[43:04] a people that God will start dealing
[43:06] with just just at a time just like how
[43:10] God did that that is the very same thing
[43:13] that he's doing with
[43:15] you
[43:18] amen our our sinful nature that we were
[43:22] born under is Babylon confusion we came
[43:26] into the word speaking
[43:28] lines we came into the word confused we
[43:32] never knew our right
[43:36] identity so he had to bring us out of
[43:40] Babylon he has to start dealing with our
[43:44] conscience he has to start dealing with
[43:46] our
[43:48] heart and he then he brings us into a
[43:51] covenant that we call the new
[43:55] birth
[43:56] amen amen then pretty soon God's eyes
[44:00] cannot move from on us now because we
[44:04] are in a covenant with
[44:06] him and then he start dealing with us
[44:09] from our life he start casting out an
[44:13] influence that's what a city
[44:15] is praise the Lord every city and many
[44:20] appolis uh uh when people talk about Los
[44:23] Angeles it's a
[44:24] city and one thing about a city is that
[44:27] it has
[44:31] influence every city has
[44:33] influence people talk about New York
[44:36] City it's
[44:37] busy it's not a slow City it's a fast
[44:42] moving
[44:44] City amen
[44:48] amen our said it say uh uh uh uh uh what
[44:53] is it Minnesota
[44:54] friendly
[44:59] amen we try to be nice to
[45:04] everybody so but what what I'm saying is
[45:06] that every city has an influence in and
[45:09] and and uh uh I'm almost losing my
[45:14] thought here but it's okay praise the
[45:16] Lord now so let's let's look at this
[45:19] let's look at this Revelation chapter 21
[45:22] verse 1 and
[45:24] two and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[45:30] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[45:33] Earth were pass away and there was no
[45:36] more seed amen and I John saw the holy
[45:41] city the New Jerusalem coming down from
[45:46] God out of Heaven prepared as a
[45:51] bride so the New Jerusalem year is
[45:56] having an
[45:58] influence as a
[46:01] bride are we together she's coming down
[46:06] when God looks at her he looks at her as
[46:10] a
[46:11] bride and we know definitely the Bride
[46:14] is a is is a wife it's a woman so we see
[46:18] here there's a parallel All Through the
[46:21] Bible all through the
[46:24] scripture Jerusalem is always having
[46:28] having an influence and and and when God
[46:31] talks to Jerusalem in the book of
[46:33] Jeremiah he says he says how how you
[46:36] were a young virgin unto
[46:40] me he's talking to the people he's
[46:42] talking to the city but he says I you
[46:45] know you were just like a Young Bride
[46:47] unto
[46:49] me praise the Lord and the same thing
[46:53] when he talks to Babylon he he he talks
[46:56] about h h h i mean how she was a war
[47:00] even from the Old Testament is running
[47:07] down are we
[47:11] together now see see something again
[47:13] Revelation chapter
[47:15] 18 Revelation chapter 18 Revelation
[47:18] chapter 19 Revelation chapter 18 verse1
[47:21] the whole the whole chapter talks about
[47:26] the destruction of Babylon it talks
[47:28] about the bumping of the
[47:30] Vatican okay that's that's just the
[47:33] reality it talking about it talks about
[47:35] the blasting of this great wle the
[47:38] Judgment of this great hole are we
[47:41] together now wash now the Bible talks
[47:45] about that you you can read the rest of
[47:47] that and and and and after these things
[47:49] I saw another angel coming down from
[47:52] heaven having a great power and the
[47:54] Earth was was was was was lightened with
[47:58] his glory and he cried mightily with a
[48:02] strong voice saying Babylon the great is
[48:05] Fallen that great woman with all of
[48:08] influence now she has come under God's
[48:12] judgment now see what will happen
[48:15] chapter
[48:24] 19
[48:26] chapter 19 verse1 and after these things
[48:29] I heard a great voice of of much people
[48:33] in heaven saying Hallelujah Salvation
[48:37] and Glory and Honor and power unto our
[48:41] God for truth and righteous are his
[48:45] judgment for he have judged the Great
[48:49] War he has judged that great woman
[48:53] amen and uh uh
[48:59] uh the great world which did corrupt the
[49:02] Earth with her fication and her and her
[49:05] vengance and her blood and and the blood
[49:08] of his servants at his hand and again
[49:10] they said
[49:12] Hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever
[49:16] and ever now you think about this here
[49:20] said in chapter 18 there is the the the
[49:23] great world is Judge
[49:26] and as soon as the great will judge now
[49:29] these these these people that are
[49:31] rejoicing and is praising God Amen the
[49:35] the scripture says in a great voice of
[49:37] people in heaven saying that I mean the
[49:40] Saints and all of that it it just tell
[49:43] that the destruction of this woman the
[49:46] eliminating of of influence bring a
[49:49] great joy and that's what happened when
[49:51] God visit the heart of a sinner by his
[49:54] power by his word word and he break you
[49:56] free from sin you rejoice and say thank
[49:59] God because now you have found your
[50:02] truth
[50:07] identity
[50:10] amen so until until we get out of this
[50:14] body until we leave this earth there is
[50:17] that attachment to jerus to to
[50:21] Babylon and what is the Babylon is our
[50:23] sinful nature
[50:29] there is there is that attachment I I
[50:31] was telling this to this and and I and I
[50:33] saw the scripture Ezekiel chapter 16
[50:35] let's look at it
[50:41] quickly I might be running you all over
[50:43] the place but it's
[50:48] okay again the word of the Lord came
[50:51] unto me saying son of man cause
[50:56] Jerusalem to know her
[51:00] Abominations amen now he's talking to
[51:03] the city now tell these people tell them
[51:07] where they are coming from tell them
[51:09] what their problem is tell them to know
[51:12] their sin the the evil that they are
[51:15] doing and said thus said the Lord God
[51:18] unto Jerusalem their
[51:20] birth their
[51:23] Nativity is of the
[51:26] land of
[51:29] Canaan amen you have had all of this
[51:33] special
[51:34] treatment love has been poured over you
[51:38] but let me tell you where your root is
[51:43] from let me tell you where your birth is
[51:47] from
[51:49] amen that City Jerusalem was the city of
[51:52] the
[51:54] jebusites
[51:57] it was it was one of the city of the
[51:59] many city in in in the land of Canaan
[52:01] that was occupied by the by you know by
[52:05] the people there you know the Canaanites
[52:07] the the the havit the jebusites it was a
[52:10] city of the
[52:13] jebusite praise the
[52:15] Lord it was where it was when h h h uh
[52:19] Kaleb was was was asking for his
[52:23] mounting he and he captured that
[52:28] City and then when David came also David
[52:31] had to to to redeem that City and that's
[52:35] that's how the name was changed from the
[52:38] city of the jebusite to jerusalen a city
[52:42] of
[52:44] Peace but its origin was not a city of
[52:47] Peace its birth is Nativity where God
[52:52] brought that City from was right from
[52:54] out of
[53:01] idolatry amen even Abraham the father of
[53:07] Faith where did his father came
[53:10] from
[53:14] Babylon is that that's where his root is
[53:17] from and that's what we all have to be
[53:22] conscious
[53:23] of it's not because Grace has come to us
[53:27] and the grace of God is dealing with us
[53:29] that you would think that you are better
[53:31] than somebody else
[53:34] amen amen
[53:38] amen oh when you think about where the
[53:42] Lord brought you from go back to the
[53:45] Lane of your Nativity go back to your
[53:54] roots
[53:55] just like how it was in the beginning
[53:58] there were Darkness upon the face of the
[54:00] Earth Darkness representing sin Darkness
[54:04] all over the faith but yet God was able
[54:07] to bring an edting out of a a a earth
[54:10] that was in chaos and that is the same
[54:13] thing that he's doing to you and myself
[54:16] to be able to bring the best out of us
[54:20] in the midst of all of our confusion and
[54:23] all of our misrepresentation and all of
[54:25] the thing that we think we
[54:32] are are we
[54:35] together he says tell Jerusalem the
[54:38] their abomination maybe let let them
[54:41] know their
[54:42] Roots then they will
[54:46] appreciate how I have been I has been
[54:48] winning their hearts every time I draw
[54:51] them I deal with them they go back to
[54:53] the idolatry if is because that's their
[54:56] root and that is the reason why we
[55:00] struggle amen amen that is the reason
[55:03] why we fight different things because
[55:06] that's our root we were born in sin shap
[55:09] in
[55:10] iniquity come to the word speaking
[55:15] lies amen that's why we had to fight to
[55:19] be able to keep our truth
[55:23] identity because there is there is a
[55:27] connection there there is a connection
[55:29] just stay away from the presence of the
[55:31] Lord stay away from Reading God's work
[55:33] stay away from praying you will see what
[55:35] will root up in your heart you will see
[55:37] the kind of evil things you will be
[55:39] thinking about the evil things you will
[55:41] be Desiring that's right that's right
[55:45] because that's our root that's the lane
[55:48] of our Nativity this
[55:50] body was born in
[55:54] sin
[55:59] are we together but what what God want
[56:03] to do do of you is to make a bride a
[56:08] door for her husband that's what he want
[56:10] to make out of
[56:12] you praise the Lord amen and what he
[56:15] would do out of the wicked is the same
[56:17] way he blasted h h h Babylon the same
[56:21] way he WEP the vatic WEP the Vatican out
[56:24] of the Earth with we by out of the earth
[56:26] that is the same way he would do with
[56:28] the
[56:31] wicked so you see that
[56:35] paraller being
[56:37] running praise the Lord right from
[56:42] Genesis there's a parer that's been
[56:44] running of the two
[56:47] cities praise the Lord now so you see
[56:51] the the the mystery there is that the T
[56:54] the hidden thing behind it is how God is
[56:58] dealing with the
[57:00] hemid where he's bringing us from and
[57:04] where he's carrying us
[57:06] to and the things that he want to
[57:10] do in our
[57:13] lives that's the reason why Jesus said
[57:17] don't look here don't look there the
[57:19] kingdom of God is in
[57:22] you it's in you
[57:25] God is dealing with the thing in you
[57:29] he's dealing with your heart he's
[57:30] dealing with your
[57:33] mind you have to be looking in
[57:37] yourself he's doing in you because it is
[57:41] not it is not joining a system it's not
[57:45] becoming a part of a country of a part
[57:49] of a
[57:51] church is what God is doing in
[57:55] you praise the Lord that is the reason
[57:59] why the man that takes consciousness of
[58:04] himself the man that takes consciousness
[58:07] of his inner
[58:09] being don't want to keep hatred don't
[58:12] want to keep malice don't want to keep
[58:15] Grudge it's the man that is getting
[58:17] closer to
[58:20] God it's it's not a man that is changing
[58:23] suit to be in church every Sunday but
[58:26] it's the one that is looking
[58:30] within and say oh God give me Grace oh
[58:33] Lord help me this is I I I need your
[58:36] grace
[58:38] here praise the Lord
[58:43] amen think about it out of this city
[58:47] like like like like
[58:49] Babylon right from it
[58:51] beginning it was it was it was a it was
[58:55] a very big massive
[58:58] city are we together very big city until
[59:03] all the little towns and little Nations
[59:06] that was around them was intimidated by
[59:10] the greatness of Babylon I mean the way
[59:12] to build a city and and and and n and
[59:16] all of those
[59:18] people but with all of that
[59:21] greatness what was happening inside that
[59:24] City
[59:25] they were worshiping
[59:28] Idols amen with all the greatness and
[59:33] all the pillars and all the civilization
[59:36] and all the building highrise building
[59:39] the thing that is done in the city
[59:41] that's what
[59:44] matters and you see that same Spirit you
[59:47] see the same system has come to our Bay
[59:50] you see big Cathedrals you see big
[59:52] buildings you see big all of those but
[59:55] the things that are done
[59:58] inside Jesus rebuked the system of his
[1:00:02] days he said you are full of dead men
[1:00:07] bones you attract people by the outside
[1:00:11] with with great pain and great
[1:00:14] architecture but you are evil
[1:00:18] inside you are evil inside that's what
[1:00:21] Babylon
[1:00:23] is
[1:00:25] praise the Lord
[1:00:28] amen but see
[1:00:31] Jerusalem when David redeemed that
[1:00:35] City it was just a little place a little
[1:00:38] despised
[1:00:40] Place praise the Lord the thing that
[1:00:43] made the greatness of that city was when
[1:00:46] God came down and honor the worship of
[1:00:50] David you remember when the Ark of the
[1:00:51] Covenant was coming back and David was
[1:00:53] dancing before the AR he he threw His
[1:00:56] Garment and God came down and honor the
[1:01:01] worship it was not because of The Skys
[1:01:04] strier that was in the city it was
[1:01:07] because of a Heart of
[1:01:10] Worship amen it was because of a heart
[1:01:13] of a man that was ready to worship God a
[1:01:17] man that was ready to throw himself down
[1:01:20] forget about what people think about me
[1:01:22] forget about what people said about
[1:01:26] me
[1:01:28] amen his own wife tried to despise him
[1:01:31] he said you never see nothing
[1:01:32] yet tomorrow is going to be worse than
[1:01:38] this because he had a
[1:01:41] heart to worship God that's
[1:01:44] Jerusalem amen that's Jerusalem not the
[1:01:48] City Jerusalem is the people Jerusalem
[1:01:51] I'm talking about the people Jerusalem
[1:01:54] I'm talking about you the people
[1:01:56] Jerusalem the people that have a heart
[1:01:59] to bring God into their home to bring
[1:02:01] God into their lives to bring God into
[1:02:05] their
[1:02:13] mid
[1:02:15] amen as soon
[1:02:18] as Babylon was dead with there was a
[1:02:22] stream Hallelujah they started praying
[1:02:24] prising God and that's the same thing
[1:02:26] that happen to the believer as soon as
[1:02:28] God comes and he deals with our sinful
[1:02:32] nature it put Praise on our
[1:02:36] lips when he cut us away from that
[1:02:39] Babylon
[1:02:40] system where we are not worshiping the
[1:02:43] man we are not worshiping the
[1:02:45] church we are not worshiping the
[1:02:49] Creed but the one that we are worshiping
[1:02:52] is the god of Heaven and Earth
[1:02:56] hallu
[1:02:59] amen it help
[1:03:02] us it help
[1:03:06] us are we
[1:03:10] together so you see the
[1:03:18] parallel with that
[1:03:21] system that later on all through just
[1:03:25] just think about it it started there
[1:03:28] with nerra
[1:03:31] amen and then for the period of
[1:03:34] time you know h h h nothing of Babylon
[1:03:39] was
[1:03:39] said it came later
[1:03:44] on it came later on in the time of
[1:03:47] Isaiah in the middle of the
[1:03:49] book then after that physical City came
[1:03:55] and Israel went to Aire and all of that
[1:03:57] nothing of Babylon was said again and at
[1:04:00] the end of the book we see here and not
[1:04:02] a great Babylon but it's associated with
[1:04:04] a
[1:04:09] woman praise the Lord so it's a system
[1:04:14] it's a
[1:04:17] spirit that's the thing that we are
[1:04:19] Waring
[1:04:20] against for our bottle is now flesh and
[1:04:23] blood
[1:04:25] amen but it's against
[1:04:27] principalities it's against Power it's a
[1:04:30] it's against Great
[1:04:35] influence praise the Lord it said gains
[1:04:38] great
[1:04:41] influence that's that is that is that is
[1:04:44] where we are now so we see
[1:04:48] here look Paul Paul Paul deare with that
[1:04:51] Paul deare with that in uh uh uh Genesis
[1:04:54] in in in Galatians chapter 4 in
[1:04:57] Galatians chapter 4 Paul there with
[1:05:00] that
[1:05:02] Amen in Galatians chapter
[1:05:08] 4 praise the
[1:05:13] Lord see the way the the the Apostle
[1:05:16] approach it here when he talks here in
[1:05:18] galatian chapter 4 verse
[1:05:21] 26 oh praise the Lord
[1:05:27] the
[1:05:28] influence of
[1:05:30] uh a great
[1:05:34] woman amen we were talking about
[1:05:38] that
[1:05:40] uh on Sunday and we
[1:05:43] show that great
[1:05:47] woman the shimina
[1:05:49] woman her
[1:05:51] greatness was not because she was a
[1:05:55] queen her greatness was in her
[1:05:58] character amen her greatness was in her
[1:06:02] character to be able to identify that
[1:06:05] this man is a holy man of
[1:06:08] God and she build a place for him to
[1:06:13] rest praise the
[1:06:16] Lord she was able to support
[1:06:22] him that's why God call her a great
[1:06:25] woman and we saw this other woman here
[1:06:28] Mr Babylon the great her greatness was
[1:06:31] in her influence to dominate to
[1:06:41] destroy praise the Lord Paul in
[1:06:44] Galatians chapter
[1:06:48] 4 he P he he he speak of
[1:06:53] this
[1:06:54] when he talks about the Alle Glory
[1:06:57] between uh uh hagga and
[1:07:01] Sarah he says but Jerusalem verse 26
[1:07:05] which is above is free which is the
[1:07:09] mother of us
[1:07:12] all
[1:07:14] amen it's above it's freed is the mother
[1:07:17] of us all that's where our new birth
[1:07:20] comes from amen that's where our our our
[1:07:24] our new nature is attached to when it
[1:07:27] talks about our old nature and our our
[1:07:30] Nativity Our Roots is from
[1:07:43] Babylon so he said you are a city on a
[1:07:47] hill you are a
[1:07:51] city the Bride is a city
[1:07:55] she's
[1:07:58] typed as New Jerusalem as a bride is a
[1:08:02] door for her
[1:08:03] husband when God looks at all that he
[1:08:07] has brought his church through and all
[1:08:09] the system that has fought
[1:08:13] against his
[1:08:15] church
[1:08:19] amen the Bible talks here in in
[1:08:22] Revelation I I I was I was trying to
[1:08:24] avoid this but let's read this and then
[1:08:27] I will try to wrap around this thought
[1:08:30] and
[1:08:30] close the meeting for the night
[1:08:33] amen let's go to
[1:08:52] revelation
[1:09:02] amen you love the Lord
[1:09:13] tonight that's uh in Revelation chapter
[1:09:17] 13 in Revelation chapter
[1:09:22] 13
[1:09:25] now in Revelation chapter 13 we read
[1:09:27] this and we deare with it a little bit
[1:09:30] here and and I and and uh and I stood
[1:09:33] upon the sand of the seed and saw a
[1:09:36] beast rise up out of the
[1:09:39] seed and rise up out of the
[1:09:42] people amen this Beast is a
[1:09:46] system it's a system that has rised up
[1:09:49] out of the
[1:09:50] people it's a system that we tracing
[1:09:53] right from Genesis it has rised up out
[1:09:55] of the people in different forms just
[1:09:58] like here in Revelation chapter 13 is
[1:10:01] showing itself as a leper is showing
[1:10:03] itself as a as a h rise out of the
[1:10:07] people having seven heads and 10 horns
[1:10:10] and upon the horns 10 crowns and upon uh
[1:10:13] and upon the head the name of
[1:10:18] blasphemy it has taken different
[1:10:22] names some great names with great
[1:10:25] meaning but it's a name of blasphemy now
[1:10:28] see what I want to get to tonight and
[1:10:31] the Beast which which I saw was like
[1:10:34] unto a leper and the feet was like a bed
[1:10:38] and the mouth was like a lion and the
[1:10:42] dragon gave him his power and his
[1:10:46] seat and great
[1:10:49] Authority now see this now and I saw one
[1:10:53] of the head as it were wounded to
[1:10:58] death and his daily wound was
[1:11:03] healed and all the word Wonder after the
[1:11:08] Beast now when brother Bram talks about
[1:11:10] this this is what happened Pagan
[1:11:14] Rome which is the last part of D Daniel
[1:11:19] Vision or Nebuchadnezzar dream the fot
[1:11:23] of iron
[1:11:24] Pagan room we
[1:11:27] know right at a time where our lord
[1:11:30] Jesus came and and even through the time
[1:11:32] of the ear Church Pagan room was ruling
[1:11:35] at that time
[1:11:38] amen but that head of pagan room was
[1:11:43] wounded to death as if to say room die
[1:11:48] off but the daily WB was healed when
[1:11:52] when it came back again it never came as
[1:11:54] an Empire it came as a
[1:11:58] church called the Roman
[1:12:00] church but it's the same Roman
[1:12:06] Empire that was ruling in the time of
[1:12:08] our Lord
[1:12:10] Jesus they they that that that that that
[1:12:13] that crucify him that that that kill the
[1:12:16] apostles All Through the Ages but now it
[1:12:19] has come in another
[1:12:22] form
[1:12:26] amen so that da W that was
[1:12:30] healed he has changed his form and
[1:12:33] that's why we be we we we see throughout
[1:12:36] the same Babylon that was there as ner
[1:12:40] they were trying to build a a tower to
[1:12:42] heaven and all of that when when that
[1:12:46] changes right there in the book of
[1:12:48] Jeremiah asai in the middle of the book
[1:12:51] we see another babyon again
[1:12:55] a change of system over in the Book of
[1:12:57] Revelation we see Babylon resurrect
[1:12:59] again but this time it's not a great
[1:13:01] City like it was of Nero it was not not
[1:13:04] like the one of of Nebuchadnezzar now
[1:13:07] it's a it's a church it's a
[1:13:09] system changing
[1:13:12] forms changing
[1:13:14] forms that's all the devil
[1:13:17] does amen that's all the devil does he
[1:13:21] just change form if he can't get you in
[1:13:23] this he will change to another thing to
[1:13:26] attract
[1:13:32] you so so you see you see what we kind
[1:13:35] of for looking at amen where we driving
[1:13:39] our TS
[1:13:41] tonight God in his
[1:13:44] Mercy he's dealing with
[1:13:47] us he's trying to bring
[1:13:51] us amen
[1:13:54] trying to bring
[1:13:56] us to our truth
[1:14:03] identification out of these two cities
[1:14:06] run
[1:14:07] parallel
[1:14:09] through and and and the history of the
[1:14:12] whole world is connected in
[1:14:16] it praise the Lord
[1:14:20] am the history of the whole world
[1:14:23] is connected in
[1:14:27] it our history is all connected in it
[1:14:32] praise the Lord every one of us before
[1:14:35] we came to the knowledge of the truth
[1:14:37] God brought us out of some kind of a
[1:14:40] system and if you check the root of that
[1:14:42] system it goes right back to Rome it
[1:14:45] goes right back to
[1:14:48] Babylon if the father of faith our
[1:14:51] Father
[1:14:52] Abraham that's where his root came from
[1:14:55] you see that's why God had to call him
[1:14:58] out God had to call him to Total
[1:15:03] separation praise the Lord to Total
[1:15:07] separation and God started dealing with
[1:15:09] him until he lost the
[1:15:13] identity of Babylon and God said your
[1:15:16] seed will so
[1:15:18] John you go back right there in the Book
[1:15:21] of Genesis it says that man Abraham the
[1:15:27] Hebrew he gain a name among the people
[1:15:31] because of his
[1:15:33] character he gained a name among the
[1:15:35] people there was one man that was
[1:15:37] standing in the earth and talking about
[1:15:39] God spoke to me one man that was
[1:15:42] standing in the earth and he was talking
[1:15:44] about God's visitation he was talking
[1:15:46] about a truth and a living God he he he
[1:15:50] gained a repetition called a Hebrew they
[1:15:52] never call him Abraham the the the
[1:15:55] Babylon might all the man out of Babylon
[1:15:58] I mean he came to Total separation until
[1:16:01] he lost his identity from
[1:16:06] Babylon and that's that's what God want
[1:16:09] to bring us to where we will lose our
[1:16:13] identity amen lose our identity lose our
[1:16:17] national spirit amen praise the
[1:16:22] Lord
[1:16:26] and having one one identity and identity
[1:16:30] is I'm a Child of God am I'm a Son of
[1:16:33] God I'm a daughter of
[1:16:36] God I'm not an African I'm not an
[1:16:38] American I'm not I'm I'm a Child of
[1:16:44] God Abraham lost his identity everybody
[1:16:47] started calling him the Hebrew Abraham
[1:16:50] the
[1:16:52] Hebrew
[1:16:54] praise the Lord but his root came out of
[1:17:00] Babylon praise the Lord this bride
[1:17:02] church that is going to be the bride
[1:17:05] where did our root came out
[1:17:08] of Jesus John the Baptist Came Calling
[1:17:11] repent the kingdom of God from Heaven
[1:17:14] John Jesus came preaching the apostles
[1:17:16] came what were they doing calling the
[1:17:18] people out of Judaism right calling them
[1:17:21] out of Judaism to a new
[1:17:26] identity and the Pharisees and the
[1:17:29] Sadducees they fought against it no we
[1:17:31] cannot allow these people to do this but
[1:17:34] you can't fight against God you can't
[1:17:36] fight against God if God is calling your
