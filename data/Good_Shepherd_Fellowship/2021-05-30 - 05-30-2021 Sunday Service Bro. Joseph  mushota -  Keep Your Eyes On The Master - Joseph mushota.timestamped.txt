[13:36] came
[13:38] it wasn't as if i forgot of it
[13:41] but i just didn't know where my mind was
[13:43] praise be to god
[13:46] yeah just listening to the first song we
[13:49] sang this morning
[13:51] because he lives i can face tomorrow
[13:55] and even coming to the second song we
[13:57] are standing on holy grounds
[13:59] and there are angels all around
[14:02] and the bible says that the angels of
[14:04] the lord and campeth
[14:05] run about them that fear him and
[14:08] wherever you find yourselves know that
[14:10] you are not alone
[14:12] the angel of the covenant is right there
[14:14] with you
[14:16] um i had a dream which one even goes
[14:18] first let me start from the back and go
[14:21] from yes when was that that was
[14:24] uh friday night
[14:27] into saturday i think we had already
[14:30] entered saturday
[14:32] we were sleeping and then danny came
[14:36] and woke us up i think it was probably
[14:39] after 12 midnight i'm not very sure
[14:44] 30 okay so
[14:47] he said gospel was not breathing well
[14:52] and then he went to his room and he saw
[14:54] that he was
[14:55] swollen all over and he asked gas well
[14:59] what is wrong with you and god says
[15:02] can't you see my eyes as well as swollen
[15:06] so he came to wake us up and then he's
[15:10] allergic to a lot of things so he had
[15:13] eaten something that previous night
[15:16] when nobody knows and
[15:21] it just surprises me anytime they are
[15:24] sick
[15:25] especially gasoline emanuel they will
[15:28] not call on you in the night
[15:31] don't wait till the following day and
[15:32] while you are talking to they say oh
[15:34] we didn't want to disturb your sleep and
[15:36] several times the american no just come
[15:40] and this voice would not do it so praise
[15:43] be to god
[15:44] danny want to use the restroom his room
[15:46] is not even
[15:47] closer to his room but he heard him
[15:51] and when he went he was swollen all over
[15:54] and he was struggling to breathe
[15:58] so his mother wanted to call 9-1-1 i
[16:00] said no let's pray
[16:02] we prayed and we took him to the
[16:04] hospital before we got there he was
[16:06] coughing and wheezing and what have you
[16:09] and then they went in they didn't allow
[16:12] me in but the mother went in with him
[16:14] and praised me to god that same night we
[16:17] went back home
[16:19] but i have been thinking about it if
[16:21] danny
[16:22] by the grace of god had not gone in at
[16:25] that century
[16:27] and this was going to sleep till
[16:30] the morning the following morning
[16:35] nobody knows what is going to happen but
[16:37] i know that the story was going to be
[16:38] very ugly
[16:41] and i just want to give god the glory
[16:43] for it
[16:44] and before then i had a dream on
[16:48] thursday
[16:51] that there was a shadow over me
[16:55] that was just fighting and i was just
[16:58] shouting the name
[16:59] jesus i was just shouting jesus
[17:02] i was and i shouted jesus so much that
[17:05] when i woke up out of sleep
[17:07] i was still shouting jesus and i could
[17:09] just
[17:10] still imagine that dark shadow in the
[17:13] room
[17:14] so um when i woke up normally i would
[17:18] get up around 4 a.m and pray and go to
[17:20] work
[17:21] i woke up around 4 00 a.m i prayed
[17:25] on my way to work on 4 94
[17:28] when i was joining 6 94 right
[17:32] where the first accident almost happened
[17:35] right in that corner they are doing a
[17:37] lot of construction
[17:39] there was a semi that was in the outer
[17:42] lane i was inside
[17:44] and they have erected some bridges they
[17:47] are miniature um
[17:48] wolves with this heavy heavy concrete
[17:52] so i was inside and both of us were
[17:55] burning the corner
[17:57] so the head of the semi left his lane
[18:01] and came into my lane so now
[18:05] i was between the head of the semi and
[18:07] the wall
[18:08] and then the body was on the other side
[18:12] so i just shouted jesus
[18:15] and the head just went back to his lane
[18:19] and i overtook it and left it behind
[18:21] because i didn't want to deal with him
[18:22] anymore
[18:24] [Music]
[18:25] praise be to god now
[18:30] i was wondering later i said it was a
[18:33] thursday
[18:34] and another tuesday comes i said the
[18:37] same corner the same place
[18:41] and i said the same devil but praise be
[18:45] to god
[18:46] the same god was there to deliver me
[18:48] [Music]
[18:51] and i just want to encourage us
[18:54] wherever you find yourself
[18:57] in fact never leave home without prayer
[19:01] sometimes i will pray leave home and
[19:03] even in the truck i will pray till i get
[19:05] to work and pray before i go
[19:07] in you may never know what is going
[19:10] on never i don't care if you are late
[19:15] still find time to pray praise be to god
[19:19] for we are serving a living god and the
[19:21] god we are serving is interested
[19:23] in every single detail of our lives

[40:00] forget your problem
[40:04] most of the time we can come in the
[40:07] church then we
[40:09] when as soon as we sit all the problem
[40:12] comes
[40:13] [Music]
[40:16] but when we are singing you feel like
[40:19] you forget your problem
[40:21] but when we start to enter in the very
[40:24] essential and important part of the
[40:26] service
[40:28] the problem comes and the sleepness you
[40:30] feel like you want to sleep
[40:33] but when they give you now say sister
[40:35] brother there is a room they go and
[40:37] sleep
[40:38] go out you won't sleep
[40:41] so ask you this morning what make you to
[40:44] sleep
[40:47] i would say my wife you can be just okay
[40:49] we came from home
[40:51] as soon as they start to preach it's
[40:53] like a blanket
[40:54] come what's wrong with this body
[41:00] this body is always against the spirit
[41:03] of god you have to know that
[41:06] you you must reach that level that this
[41:09] body is full of nonsense
[41:13] that's why i don't give it everything
[41:16] this
[41:16] body ask you
[41:21] this body is full of nonsense enemy of
[41:24] joseph is joseph himself
[41:28] that's when you start to reach that
[41:30] level you will never
[41:32] have enemies because you are an ego
[41:36] you can handle any situation
[41:39] any circumstance it's work in your
[41:42] family
[41:43] everywhere you are an ego do you know
[41:46] the
[41:47] value of
[41:50] one converted soul is
[41:54] do you know that one converted so
[41:58] equal to ten thousand world
[42:03] that's why you have to know the value of
[42:06] yourself don't let nobody to fool on you
[42:10] say you are nothing

[52:20] this morning
[52:23] sometimes we do prepare we write we give
[52:26] quotations verses it's okay
[52:29] but sometimes we
[52:32] we just want a real god
[52:36] sometimes we have to ask ourselves
[52:41] since you believe the message
[52:44] if you just one time you just sit and
[52:47] ask yourself
[52:49] since you believe the message
[52:53] do you change are you changing
[52:58] why did you believe the message
[53:02] are you trying to ask yourself those
[53:04] questions
[53:07] and when you come from there and ask
[53:08] yourself why are you leaving
[53:13] how many people they died
[53:16] you know why god
[53:20] still keeping you
[53:25] that's why i never be absent to mind
[53:28] that when god put
[53:30] people on my way i always take advantage
[53:34] to fellowship and to talk because you
[53:37] don't know why
[53:37] put those people in your way
[53:42] sometimes god let us to go in the way
[53:46] you never thought you you are going to
[53:48] go that way
[53:50] why god allow you to go that way
[53:54] judge myself i was telling my wife i
[53:56] said
[53:58] sometimes when i'm talking to her she
[53:59] feels bad sometimes she can start crying
[54:02] i said baby maybe you misunderstand me
[54:06] i don't know maybe misunderstand
[54:08] sometimes i can say baby sometimes i
[54:09] feel
[54:10] like marriage is a vanity of vanity
[54:14] money is a vanity vanity the world is
[54:17] even
[54:18] working nothing i just feel like i just
[54:20] want to be in the bosom of the lord
[54:21] jesus christ
[54:24] maybe it means i'm not making i said no
[54:25] baby you're making me so
[54:27] happy i just want to leave you with you
[54:28] forever i love you
[54:31] but i'm talking about my lord
[54:36] understand me in the spiritual side you
[54:38] are my friend your best friend i have to
[54:40] share
[54:40] because sometimes you can see me i
[54:42] become indifferent i just want to be
[54:44] with god sometimes i don't want any what
[54:46] be filled with you
[54:47] i just want to be in the corner with god
[54:49] that's the i feel that way
[54:55] i feel that way it's uh i always stay
[54:58] with my my brother ariel that's
[55:00] i always preach what i'm going through
[55:01] what i talk with people
[55:03] because that's that's that's the
[55:05] preaching that's why when i don't have
[55:07] something to give you i won't preach to
[55:09] preach is
[55:10] you just surrender you talk you you
[55:12] listen to the inspiration you touch they
[55:14] touch the end we pray
[55:16] we can read the scripture scripture but
[55:17] sometimes we have to
[55:19] we have to ask ourselves where are we
[55:21] going
[55:24] where are we going with this message
[55:26] well and there's a message with this
[55:27] news you hear
[55:28] this pastor left the church that one
[55:30] this one that one killed that one
[55:32] all those bad news bad news bad news
[55:34] what are you doing about those news
[55:39] are you carrying those news now in the
[55:42] internet when you find a
[55:43] pastor back sliding now now you you
[55:45] become now it's
[55:46] you become a preacher now sister
[55:48] preacher brother preacher because of
[55:49] you hear the wrong instead of you hear
[55:51] those words you kneel down you start to
[55:53] cry
[55:56] amen you start to cry because this is
[55:59] something we never heard in the message
[56:01] if there is a waste things you never
[56:04] heard
[56:04] nonsense and there it is in the aware of
[56:07] the message i'm telling you right now
[56:09] we we can't we can't hide it
[56:13] some people they can't even come and
[56:14] visit us because they have
[56:16] those news but they forget there is a
[56:19] genuine
[56:22] weather is a fake there is also genuine
[56:25] before there is a
[56:26] there is a fake genuineness must be
[56:28] there first
[56:29] [Music]
[56:33] that's why you also you must be a
[56:35] spiritual
[56:36] to to judge right
[56:40] be spiritual to judge right because
[56:42] don't judge because of someone of tribe
[56:45] don't judge because of german country
[56:47] don't judge because of because because
[56:49] of
[56:49] judge because your spirit of discernment
[56:53] the spirit of god it judge the person
[56:56] according spirit
[56:57] that's it that's the discernment it's
[57:01] allow
[57:03] to the church not messianic
[57:06] discernment sister you came from
[57:09] i know your name your sister fetu
[57:13] no and you came from that is only
[57:15] brother branham
[57:18] i can give you quotations of that don't
[57:20] try that one don't try if
[57:22] someone is doing just give him a yes
[57:24] he'll collapse like no one business
[57:27] i'm telling in africa where i travel so
[57:30] people
[57:31] someone start to discern you know you
[57:33] know
[57:34] when you came from in the desert they
[57:36] come to me oh they just after him he was
[57:38] like his star i told him hey hey guys
[57:42] so what he's listening is correct i told
[57:44] him
[57:45] even the discernment it's correct one
[57:48] day
[57:49] it will get wrong do you know why
[57:53] brother branham he came from two sects
[57:57] but is a different of us his makeup
[58:02] yeah that one you have to know that's
[58:03] why some quotation
[58:05] we have to believe not to understand
[58:09] where the doctrine is today because you
[58:11] want to understand before you believe
[58:14] we have a problem eat the first the food
[58:17] now the vitamin in you gonna give you
[58:20] understanding
[58:21] that's why god raised someone didn't
[58:24] know how to write his name
[58:26] he put their pastor
[58:30] simon someone didn't study
[58:34] you are a pastor their pastor from this
[58:36] rock
[58:38] and he was the pastor of the church it's
[58:40] not about
[58:41] french or english or you how you can
[58:44] join eat ideas whatever but when you
[58:47] want to send
[58:48] someone to the greek does their
[58:51] intellect
[58:52] he send the pro he knows how to do
[58:55] things because
[58:56] paul was very intelligent you can't
[59:00] play with his mind he can enter in your
[59:02] mathematics he come out with the word
[59:05] hallelujah
[59:06] amen but when he sent paul there they
[59:09] will put him in the corner
[59:11] that's the way god knows but poor if
[59:14] peter was a pastor
[59:15] of paul but one day paul correct fear
[59:20] and the people say amen hallelujah
[59:23] that's the holy spirit we want to have
[59:25] knowledge holy spirit to give you become
[59:27] proud when you feel proud that's not the
[59:29] holy spirit
[59:30] is a ghost
[59:34] [Applause]
[59:36] he's the ghost we need the holy spirit
[59:38] can it break you
[59:39] down you know the holy spirit can you
[59:41] change your behavior you know the spirit
[59:43] can it change you completely when you
[59:45] see dennis coming back
[59:47] i kneel down i cry he's not the force of
[59:49] his mother
[59:50] or his father is the lord jesus christ
[59:52] dealing with you
[59:53] young brother when i just said young
[59:54] brother you just come and sit you don't
[59:56] know you don't want to do anything
[59:58] you just sit surrender no one can change
[1:00:00] we preach in many years we preach tell
[1:00:03] yes
[1:00:03] we pray four years we make hypocrite in
[1:00:06] the bench
[1:00:06] long skate they remove the sitting dead
[1:00:09] don't change
[1:00:10] why because we met this message at the
[1:00:13] rules
[1:00:14] rule and regulations in the message in
[1:00:18] our church in our church
[1:00:20] but when the pastor is doing nonsense
[1:00:22] you don't want to say anything
[1:00:24] you hide if there is a people that are
[1:00:25] doing more nonsense in this message
[1:00:28] is the preachers being the puppet and
[1:00:30] they don't want to hear that
[1:00:32] and you you can't say anything because
[1:00:34] as we forgot to speak us
[1:00:36] you hear us you can't say anything there
[1:00:38] is somebody
[1:00:39] god who is saying will condemn them will
[1:00:42] condemn
[1:00:42] us will condemn you through god not a
[1:00:45] person
[1:00:45] but god always uses somebody this
[1:00:48] morning stand with the lord
[1:00:50] there is no one can he left behind this
[1:00:52] message there is no one is on top of the
[1:00:54] message
[1:00:54] the message is god himself what you have
[1:00:56] to know is to put god at his place
[1:00:59] to put your prophet brahm at his place
[1:01:01] to put yourself at this place
[1:01:03] that you can grow up
[1:01:06] joseph what is your secret my secret is
[1:01:10] i believe the message from god through
[1:01:13] is the seventh william marion
[1:01:15] that is making me like this this
[1:01:18] character came from there
[1:01:20] because i told my wife if they remove a
[1:01:23] prophet in your
[1:01:24] in your way we become a denomination a
[1:01:26] pentecostal
[1:01:28] you have to leave bran number if isaac
[1:01:32] if rebecca left isaac on the way
[1:01:35] she's not gonna meet isaac
[1:01:39] she must stick with isaac
[1:01:43] until she met she must stick with
[1:01:46] eliezer
[1:01:47] until she met to meet isaac
[1:01:51] that's the big mistake we are doing in
[1:01:54] the in the assemblies
[1:01:55] some they kick branham out someday
[1:01:58] worshipping him
[1:01:59] but the bride you must walk on the
[1:02:01] middle
[1:02:02] just balance trust the lord
[1:02:05] just balance is a wind it's a storm
[1:02:09] branagh is not god brahma is god
[1:02:12] what time is it good i was saying but i
[1:02:14] was telling my wife
[1:02:17] one day she called me he said there is
[1:02:20] one brother preached
[1:02:22] it declared that how absolute is a
[1:02:24] brother branham
[1:02:26] you know i always preach what i'm living
[1:02:28] i always preach what i'm talking to my
[1:02:29] wife
[1:02:30] and when i come here it's that's me if
[1:02:33] you don't take it
[1:02:34] it's up to you i always say because it
[1:02:37] can help one soul
[1:02:38] they're there if it doesn't help you put
[1:02:41] aside when
[1:02:42] the chicken is not okay you you just
[1:02:44] take a meat and whatever bonzo throw it
[1:02:46] away
[1:02:47] we don't force you but there is
[1:02:48] somebody's helping him
[1:02:52] you see so i i i spoke to her i said
[1:02:57] is the way he said and is
[1:03:00] a stranger in the church you don't know
[1:03:02] the church
[1:03:03] you bring a raw quotation
[1:03:07] but there is a way i told him
[1:03:10] brother branham himself one day i'll
[1:03:12] give that quotation because
[1:03:14] i didn't know that i was going to preach
[1:03:16] to them but it's okay
[1:03:17] and he said my absolute
[1:03:21] is the bible that's brother branham my
[1:03:24] absolute is the bible

[1:03:41] that's it
[1:03:45] that's it you like or not that's the
[1:03:47] things are
[1:03:48] if you want to grab yourself it's
[1:03:50] yourself
[1:03:51] that's the quotation exactly what he
[1:03:53] said i give to you
[1:03:55] so now the way you can
[1:03:58] present to the people and the way you
[1:04:01] people you take it
[1:04:03] right me if someone said that me someone
[1:04:05] came and start to preach pranam god he
[1:04:07] will never shake me
[1:04:09] i'll just look at him and finish if he
[1:04:10] just smile i said
[1:04:12] you understand very wrong
[1:04:18] wrong but is to yeah i know
[1:04:21] that spirit is not easy only god can
[1:04:24] take those people when the spirit can
[1:04:26] catch you you have to run away i don't
[1:04:28] know if me i can't but god can

[1:16:42] to televisions
[1:16:44] they come with a spirit of television
[1:16:46] the church that's my experience
[1:16:49] when they watch television all night
[1:16:50] like saturday a lot of movies nice
[1:16:53] they don't have time to pray they come
[1:16:55] with that spirit in the church you
[1:16:57] struggle to preach
[1:16:59] that's the truth i'm telling you so you
[1:17:02] feel it now when i feel that
[1:17:03] heaviness as you i changed the preaching
[1:17:06] you watch so much television yesterday

[1:23:53] where there isn't nothing so tell me
[1:23:55] what happened
[1:23:56] they hear the fish they just hear this
[1:23:59] their voice of
[1:24:00] the creator come and go that side
[1:24:07] god is more than able to heal your
[1:24:10] sickness
[1:24:12] god is more than able to change your
[1:24:15] life
[1:24:16] god is more than able to help you this
[1:24:19] morning
[1:24:20] the god of william branham is the same
[1:24:23] yesterday today and forever
[1:24:24] he's the same god who protected daniel
[1:24:28] in the lion pain in the same god who
[1:24:31] protect the tree hero
[1:24:32] in the fire that fire didn't burn them
[1:24:35] that fire burned the boundary
[1:24:38] there was a free walking in the fire and
[1:24:41] the ac
[1:24:42] oh good hair was in the fire it was a
[1:24:45] wonderful temperature
[1:24:47] they feel like they don't wanna even
[1:24:49] come out of faith
[1:24:50] because the master of the wind was there
[1:24:54] the creator of the heavens what they
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:25:03] the problem is sometimes as preachers
[1:25:07] we are very proud just to say sorry
[1:25:11] i'm against us because that's most
[1:25:15] no sense people are doing now behind
[1:25:16] this puppet most
[1:25:18] today are preachers
[1:25:22] that's why don't worry god is in your
[1:25:25] side too
[1:25:26] don't complain because as we don't say
[1:25:28] anything
[1:25:29] god always take side for each children
[1:25:32] god always speak myself i need help
[1:25:36] you need the help when i'm here i'm
[1:25:38] preaching to myself it doesn't mean when
[1:25:40] i'm in front of i'm more than you
[1:25:42] no ways i need god i need your prayer
[1:25:46] i need the grace the way you need to he
[1:25:49] just give me a ministry
[1:25:50] something i can preach with her to help
[1:25:53] me and to help you
[1:25:54] and i say god protect my life if i don't
[1:25:58] live
[1:25:59] i'm not going to preach i didn't choose
[1:26:01] you you have chosen me
[1:26:03] help me to leave my salmon if i say i'm
[1:26:06] not
[1:26:07] living wrong i will never preach i'll
[1:26:09] sit
[1:26:10] you will kill me i didn't write it later
[1:26:13] i'm a preacher
[1:26:14] you have chosen me to help me to stay in
[1:26:17] and to give the life because it take
[1:26:19] life to life
[1:26:21] no life there is no life god bless you
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:29] ask yourself since you believe the
[1:26:32] message
[1:26:34] you know sometimes they take advantage
[1:26:38] don't speak wrong your brother
[1:26:41] does become a sister the brother came in
[1:26:44] our midst
[1:26:45] he become like a wolf it's not to play
[1:26:47] with our sisters and you just keep quiet
[1:26:51] don't speak wrong about brothers you
[1:26:53] misunderstand
[1:26:54] that scripture that brother you have to
[1:26:57] kick him out of the church
[1:27:00] yeah and before we take him out we have
[1:27:02] to talk
[1:27:04] we can't give out quiet we don't want to
[1:27:07] talk
[1:27:08] no no we talk about it
[1:27:11] so don't misunderstand the scripture
[1:27:14] don't the scripture are clear that's why
[1:27:18] when we judge we have to judge with the
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:21] spirit you have to check your motive
[1:27:24] are you judging base of what
[1:27:28] are you judging based of the scripture
[1:27:32] or are you judging best of your
[1:27:34] understanding
[1:27:35] or your hatred because you add those
[1:27:38] people and
[1:27:39] you put them in the group if someone you
[1:27:42] looked at them
[1:27:43] all of them they are the same wrong
[1:27:48] god got his children everywhere
[1:27:52] god is going to take one by one
[1:27:55] everywhere we don't know where they are
[1:27:57] that's why sometimes we invite
[1:27:59] maybe the last one can come and we can
[1:28:02] go to the rapture clap the hand for the
[1:28:04] lord
[1:28:05] praise god
[1:28:06] [Applause]
[1:28:11] efficient night
[1:28:14] you didn't find anything then
[1:28:18] according to your word the master it
[1:28:22] wrong
[1:28:23] and the result was there what is it
[1:28:27] isa it surrender is knowledge
[1:28:32] isarenda is bright it surrender
[1:28:36] what he thought that he knew
[1:28:39] he's a the tactics i can call it
[1:28:43] and he said god help me this morning
[1:28:46] i know i was a sinner said by grace and
[1:28:49] when he saw the hand of the lord
[1:28:51] he kneeled down you see just go away
[1:28:54] from me
[1:28:54] i'm man of you know you see humbleness
[1:28:58] you see harmonies so when you so you see
[1:29:01] god doing something
[1:29:02] if it wasn't my prayer you can't you
[1:29:04] know i prayed
[1:29:05] you didn't heal him god uses him even if
[1:29:08] you didn't pray there is an
[1:29:10] another person is going to pray amen if
[1:29:12] he's not
[1:29:13] me who are you you're dust you are
[1:29:16] nothing
[1:29:17] just a dust also only him make you if he
[1:29:20] just pull away that breath of life i'm
[1:29:22] going to breathe
[1:29:23] we're going to bury you so what what why
[1:29:26] that pride
[1:29:27] why when the husband says something
[1:29:30] demons or sister god help you to calm
[1:29:33] down
[1:29:34] let your husband to your husband be a
[1:29:36] wife
[1:29:37] that's the blessing brother you also
[1:29:39] don't don't be a soldier
[1:29:41] in the message sister in the kitchen no
[1:29:45] see is you your pardon she's your friend
[1:29:51] balance we have to balance everyone must
[1:29:53] stay at this place
[1:29:57] it's a love love love love it
[1:30:00] doesn't even see the mistake
[1:30:04] you just love you don't know why that's
[1:30:05] what i always say if people you know
[1:30:07] joseph branham is a brother like me
[1:30:13] brother branham is a brother like me but
[1:30:15] is my prophet
[1:30:17] is brother branham say joseph a prophet
[1:30:20] i say amen i stop there once you i have
[1:30:23] to check
[1:30:24] which kind of a prophet joseph is what
[1:30:26] he's going to do with you in your faith
[1:30:29] you're wasting your time he said he's a
[1:30:32] prophet keep quiet he's a prophet
[1:30:34] move on we have only one prophet of the
[1:30:36] age by the brahmanam
[1:30:38] that's it sometimes i can follow joseph
[1:30:41] joseph himself he doesn't have a problem
[1:30:43] he's the people they have a problem
[1:30:45] his people they misunderstand him and
[1:30:48] they can't help them because they wanted
[1:30:49] someone
[1:30:49] misunderstand it takes god to help
[1:30:53] oh joseph they must know to preach no
[1:30:55] jesus never said we must not
[1:30:57] preach but he say plague the tape you
[1:30:59] want also to listen that's why sometimes
[1:31:02] pastor warner put the tape because you
[1:31:04] must get used to malachi 4.
[1:31:07] it help us to come back on the line
[1:31:10] malachi 4 don't ever don't allow don't
[1:31:12] allow malachi to go out of your way
[1:31:14] you will never get wrong you'll be like
[1:31:16] a pentecostal you can't even have
[1:31:18] something to say
[1:31:19] what to make us of success to preach you
[1:31:22] can just preach three hours without
[1:31:24] refreeding is the message though i don't
[1:31:26] cult because it's the message i eat i
[1:31:28] eat i pray
[1:31:29] i become the message walking they are
[1:31:30] late
[1:31:32] grab them for the lord
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:39] this message is powerful this message
[1:31:42] can change
[1:31:43] because the one who preach this message
[1:31:45] is not brother branham is the angel
[1:31:48] so when you put in your mind that is the
[1:31:50] angel then you understand
[1:31:53] when you approach brother branham you
[1:31:54] don't see brother branham you press the
[1:31:56] the flesh you enter inside you see the
[1:31:59] hello him
[1:32:00] amen that was in the brother branham
[1:32:04] one day medal was just cracked the hand
[1:32:06] good they don't trap
[1:32:08] he didn't know it was the hinge you said
[1:32:09] they want the angel was displeased
[1:32:12] i can't help you honey i love you but to
[1:32:14] him
[1:32:16] praise the lord but him my best friend
[1:32:19] but abraham was the best friend of the
[1:32:22] lord that's why sometimes can come in
[1:32:24] the campaign i don't need your help
[1:32:26] we are okay i come to help you because
[1:32:28] he knows money it's always distort
[1:32:30] this this step and they destroy the
[1:32:32] ministry though they need
[1:32:34] money for the campaign they need the
[1:32:35] money to travel but some
[1:32:37] companies no no don't make the offering
[1:32:40] no no please i don't need your money
[1:32:42] it's okay keep it help others because it
[1:32:44] could
[1:32:45] detect as the prophet you know why the
[1:32:47] prophet when he was
[1:32:49] born is the subconscious and conscience
[1:32:52] is december place you and i
[1:32:56] your subconscious and conscience are
[1:32:58] separate
[1:32:59] you to dream you must sleep but the
[1:33:02] problem to dream
[1:33:03] he must not sleep it can just be breath
[1:33:05] a break in the dream it breaks to the
[1:33:06] other world
[1:33:07] he started to dream that vision that's
[1:33:09] what i said when the dream
[1:33:11] is fulfilled it becomes a vision it is
[1:33:14] something he just
[1:33:15] vice versa it's the way it comes now
[1:33:18] brother branham is the prophet of the
[1:33:20] age when the discernment
[1:33:22] came from the devil is makeup
[1:33:26] it could detect the origin of the
[1:33:28] discernment
[1:33:31] now i'm explaining to you why when
[1:33:33] someone start to do this
[1:33:34] messianic discernment you have to run
[1:33:36] away
[1:33:38] sometimes people they like is telling me
[1:33:40] what happened i'm okay
[1:33:42] me even if you tell me i don't care
[1:33:46] what my past for what and he can give it
[1:33:50] to the devil can you take the past god
[1:33:51] he doesn't you see it
[1:33:53] he forgive you he throw it in the sea of
[1:33:56] forgiveness
[1:33:57] he doesn't deceit the devil is busy
[1:33:59] reminding you your past
[1:34:00] and you keeping on your past when god
[1:34:02] doesn't see thee so you are clean
[1:34:05] for the lord
[1:34:06] [Applause]
[1:34:10] so but the brother could see the origin
[1:34:14] of the discernment though it can
[1:34:17] be correct but is can you see what
[1:34:20] it came from because the devil also can
[1:34:23] bring stuff
[1:34:24] in the past so he can know how to reject
[1:34:28] to take what it came from god that's why
[1:34:30] i said it's never fail
[1:34:32] because it was god himself bringing it
[1:34:35] when the devil tried it doesn't it can
[1:34:39] because his makeup subconscious and his
[1:34:42] conscience
[1:34:43] is a seer
[1:34:46] is a sea it means you you are down
[1:34:49] someone tell you the thief they are
[1:34:52] coming you you don't see there is a war
[1:34:55] and you have to say amen you don't see
[1:34:57] sister and brother you don't
[1:34:59] you must just follow hey so that they
[1:35:01] they see that they
[1:35:02] saw the enemy they are coming so when
[1:35:04] they see i said you start to correct
[1:35:06] now you know he's a man
[1:35:09] when he was talking about this this is
[1:35:11] what run away from those people it's
[1:35:13] intimate they are talking wrong about
[1:35:15] the message
[1:35:16] they are trying to discourage you they
[1:35:18] are trying to destroy your faith
[1:35:22] this message is a life this message is a
[1:35:25] powerful
[1:35:26] this message is money this message is
[1:35:28] wife his husband
[1:35:29] this message is it is bright i saw it in
[1:35:32] and out
[1:35:33] i'm telling you by experience
[1:35:36] and there is everything but abraham will
[1:35:38] preach in everything even
[1:35:40] how to raise our children he said when
[1:35:43] the mother

[1:37:01] i'm
[1:37:01] encouraging you change so i'm
[1:37:04] asking you since when you come to church
[1:37:08] what is your vision what do you feel
[1:37:12] when you sit you come you pray what do
[1:37:15] you want to be
[1:37:17] coming yourself why did you believe the
[1:37:20] message
[1:37:21] i come back again to that question if
[1:37:23] you try that time that you just sit
[1:37:26] you say god i don't know why
[1:37:30] you brought me here what is my position
[1:37:33] why
[1:37:34] am i here did you try to ask
[1:37:37] god for that you have to do that
[1:37:41] clapton for the lord amen amen
[1:37:53] praise the lord are you tired
[1:37:58] i don't want you to sleep me if people
[1:38:00] start to sleep
[1:38:03] some people they can continue no no no
[1:38:05] no something's wrong let us pray
[1:38:07] we can stand up and start praying
[1:38:11] for the lord amen praise the lord
[1:38:16] we are going somewhere
[1:38:20] this message is the message of the hour
[1:38:23] is taking us to heaven
[1:38:26] we are already in heaven a place in
[1:38:28] christ jesus hallelujah
[1:38:31] you know all those words is not just a
[1:38:33] slogan
[1:38:37] that that anointing you will never get
[1:38:41] it
[1:38:41] out of the word never you know there is
[1:38:44] a such
[1:38:45] good presence like we are sitting here
[1:38:48] we come in
[1:38:49] we pray we listen to the message we sing
[1:38:53] you will never get our house for the
[1:38:55] message or out of the church like this
[1:38:58] that's not that's why when that
[1:38:59] announcing comes that's the way you have
[1:39:01] to pray you you
[1:39:02] take that anointing that's why one day
[1:39:03] by brahmana said
[1:39:05] see i'm wrinkling my eyes because of
[1:39:09] the girl she's just entering in the
[1:39:11] church
[1:39:12] i'm happy to see rebecca coming in
[1:39:16] because of this anointing in the church
[1:39:19] she can receive the holy spirit it was
[1:39:22] in 1965
[1:39:23] he's talking about his daughter rebecca
[1:39:27] so you you can see that but the prana
[1:39:30] was a prophet but didn't they have
[1:39:31] the power to leave to give the holy
[1:39:33] spirit to rebecca if you take the
[1:39:35] anointing
[1:39:37] at the place you create that's why we
[1:39:39] sing
[1:39:40] we pray for that anointing when god
[1:39:43] come down then he can attach your soul
[1:39:46] and to serve
[1:39:47] you that's why you must take advantage
[1:39:50] one way in his presence
[1:39:51] forget about your neighbor don't be shy
[1:39:55] it's come for all of us sometimes you
[1:39:57] feel like

[1:50:25] to disparity let's just i'm pulling up
[1:50:28] because he's my best friend he must he
[1:50:30] must understand me sometimes when i
[1:50:31] behave funny
[1:50:32] you know sometimes spiritual people you
[1:50:33] behave funny sometimes you don't
[1:50:35] understand yourself
[1:50:36] you don't know what you want so she must
[1:50:39] know when i'm in
[1:50:40] that confusion is your confusion between
[1:50:42] the two hero
[1:50:43] that's why but the branham says
[1:50:44] sometimes beta can think like i don't
[1:50:47] love her
[1:50:47] i don't want to be with her but i love
[1:50:49] her he just stopped there he doesn't
[1:50:51] explain
[1:50:52] but when you're not spiritual you can't
[1:50:53] understand
[1:50:55] mother thought that i don't love i love
[1:50:57] her but that i didn't want to be her
[1:50:59] with her i want to fish that quotation
[1:51:02] it didn't explain why it remained there
[1:51:05] you must have a spiritual
[1:51:07] to understand what if it was going
[1:51:09] through a spiritual man sometimes you
[1:51:11] don't understand that's what i'm with my
[1:51:13] wife sometimes
[1:51:15] so i'm trying to train her to understand
[1:51:19] the spiritual people the spiritual
[1:51:20] husband
[1:51:21] she wrote on her book i'll marry a
[1:51:23] preacher say okay
[1:51:25] so i always remind her when i'm into her
[1:51:28] nerves
[1:51:31] she come back you wrote yourself that
[1:51:34] you want to marry a preacher i am a
[1:51:36] preacher
[1:51:37] i didn't write in your book she wasn't
[1:51:40] thinking why she told me
[1:51:42] he regretted you know she didn't tell me
[1:51:44] there is a good advantage of the
[1:51:46] preacher and there is also bad advantage
[1:51:49] so always when i want to be
[1:51:52] with god i miss you when you want to be
[1:51:56] with
[1:51:56] me you like how not i'll be with
[1:52:00] god
[1:52:03] you can't change it because i told you
[1:52:06] between
[1:52:06] jesus and you mama i will choose jesus
[1:52:11] hallelujah oh praise the lord
[1:52:14] clapton for the lord
[1:52:21] but he's a sweden she's very muslim
[1:52:24] i love her really i i don't regret to
[1:52:27] marry my wife i'm honest i took my time
[1:52:32] i marry her egg early
[1:52:36] relationship there is a problem whatever
[1:52:38] you know the character between two
[1:52:40] families before it's
[1:52:41] mangled it's always a sparkle
[1:52:45] until you understand your adjust because
[1:52:47] only things you can
[1:52:49] compromise is your character between the
[1:52:51] families
[1:52:52] but you can't compromise the world
[1:52:57] i always tell her the word of god we put
[1:52:59] there we follow there is no compromising
[1:53:02] but my character i like a pup you like
[1:53:04] rice
[1:53:08] you like fufu i like a chicken we can
[1:53:11] compromise
[1:53:12] you cook three times the chicken meals i
[1:53:14] like fish
[1:53:15] compromising that's about marriage
[1:53:19] compromising
[1:53:21] but the word there is no compromising
[1:53:24] that's where you succeed because our
[1:53:26] culture
[1:53:27] is the word of god clap the hand for
[1:53:30] them
[1:53:31] [Applause]
[1:53:37] i always said i can expose my wife i can
[1:53:39] expose myself so what about you
[1:53:44] that's me that's the way i preach i
[1:53:46] don't anything
[1:53:47] i don't know that's the way you grow up
[1:53:51] you know you can't give what you don't
[1:53:54] have
[1:53:56] i always say though that you can't give
[1:53:58] what you've got but abraham said if the
[1:54:00] pastor is
[1:54:00] arrogant when he's preaching observe his
[1:54:03] church people will be arrogant
[1:54:07] take his spirit to you not the holy
[1:54:09] spirit
[1:54:12] so if really i must stand in front of
[1:54:14] you
[1:54:15] and i have a wife better biting
[1:54:20] gossiping she the problem is that
[1:54:23] she's the one when the sister they want
[1:54:25] to fight when they want to talk
[1:54:27] they mentioned my wife babe i didn't say
[1:54:30] in that way i would just
[1:54:32] say it hey
[1:54:39] praise the lord amen amen
[1:54:42] praise the lord that's that's why i
[1:54:44] always say father you gave me the
[1:54:45] ministry
[1:54:47] help me with my wife because
[1:54:50] i can't stand in here she's not right i
[1:54:54] don't think she must be perfect
[1:54:55] no there is a man many things we can
[1:54:58] follow
[1:54:58] the message man of life the life
[1:55:02] so when you have it you can give it
[1:55:05] and before when inspiration starts to
[1:55:07] come i will share with her first
[1:55:09] i say i say sometimes she's tired the
[1:55:11] poor girl yo
[1:55:15] praise the lord she's been in trouble
[1:55:18] i'm sorry babies i am that's the way i
[1:55:21] am
[1:55:22] live there for the lord amen amen
[1:55:26] that's the message of the hour when you
[1:55:29] ask
[1:55:29] our brother and sister how many years
[1:55:32] they stay there
[1:55:34] ask them how many things they've been
[1:55:37] going through
[1:55:38] until they get old ask them
[1:55:41] they will tell you they're always quiet
[1:55:44] they always see
[1:55:45] sometimes they can see these young
[1:55:46] preachers something they don't know they
[1:55:49] just pray for us
[1:55:50] because us we are preachers but they can
[1:55:54] help us
[1:55:55] they can call young people come there is
[1:55:57] one two three four one
[1:55:58] ah okay pray for me you know yeah i love

[1:56:09] but you'll say okay pray for me my
[1:56:11] friend you know
[1:56:13] i pray for me sometimes you look down
[1:56:15] upon

[1:58:49] he doesn't know what to do confused it
[1:58:51] means i thought
[1:58:52] i'll give an example when
[1:58:55] you are on the stage
[1:58:59] this is you know when you take a message
[1:59:01] as a law it's killing
[1:59:02] people message is not the law the
[1:59:05] message is a life
[1:59:08] when the message becomes a law we are we
[1:59:10] are
[1:59:11] building the hypocrite sitting on the
[1:59:14] bench
[1:59:17] i said and you you are in a good
[1:59:20] position
[1:59:21] and the sister she's falling on the
[1:59:23] stairs
[1:59:25] because you can't hug the sister you

[2:07:15] he was thinking over and over it will be
[2:07:17] materialized until it
[2:07:19] reached the curtain of time to cross it
[2:07:21] to reach god
[2:07:22] amen and wanted to reach god and the
[2:07:24] gods
[2:07:26] and talk to the devil do you notice my
[2:07:30] servant because
[2:07:31] his thought crossed the curtain
[2:07:34] of the life it reached
[2:07:37] at the holy place because that thought
[2:07:39] was materialized one day i'll come and
[2:07:41] teach you
[2:07:42] how you thought can it be materialized
[2:07:45] it can be a christian
[2:07:46] oh no that's why babylon said you must
[2:07:47] be always
[2:07:49] positive don't fear nothing
[2:07:53] when you fear that you fear when you
[2:07:55] think over and over it comes
[2:07:57] because you are so it becomes solid

[2:08:03] things

[2:08:09] problem said they can break you break
[2:08:10] you you come to
[2:08:11] invisible do you know that the invisible

[2:10:33] understand me
[2:10:34] and she was calling me my husband is

[2:11:01] time i can say something
[2:11:03] she doesn't want to do it we don't fight
[2:11:05] and you know what they are very proud
[2:11:07] because we don't beat them

[2:11:45] christian they are not
[2:11:46] christian you know i refuse bless
[2:11:51] sister when she he asked you to go to
[2:11:54] their church
[2:11:55] or to the party or whatever go
[2:11:59] be submit first
[2:12:03] when you submit you engage the law
[2:12:07] of reaction hallelujah you don't know
[2:12:12] submit first go with him even to the
[2:12:16] party
[2:12:16] but don't act like them don't drink

[2:12:27] and
[2:12:27] when you do that you allow the word of
[2:12:30] god to work on him
[2:12:33] when you refuse you bring pride and he
[2:12:36] gonna say
[2:12:37] what your church is teaching you to be
[2:12:39] disobedient
[2:12:41] exactly church the word is
[2:12:44] sinful you just apply
[2:12:48] what is killing us is a pride
[2:12:52] sometimes as preachers we are so proud
[2:12:56] and we don't know i was praying for god
[2:13:00] to notice that
[2:13:01] i was also proud i didn't know until god
[2:13:04] revealed to me
[2:13:07] so if god revealed to me how many
[2:13:09] preachers also they
[2:13:10] are they didn't yet have that revelation
[2:13:13] we are so proud
[2:13:14] and when they are talking sometimes you
[2:13:15] can see it you are wrong
[2:13:18] you want to generate to put that general
[2:13:20] that
[2:13:21] that wrong is become for everybody no
[2:13:24] if something happened humble yourself as
[2:13:27] forgiveness
[2:13:28] even if you are not wrong forgive me
[2:13:33] that god knows my heart i was
[2:13:36] going to tell a story but
[2:13:40] be spiritual to understand it someday
[2:13:42] know it some they don't know it
[2:13:45] one pastor was praying he said he was
[2:13:47] praying to the mountain
[2:13:50] he prayed and after he finished
[2:13:53] they call him to the phone
[2:13:57] they said there is one person was killed
[2:14:01] here can you come and
[2:14:04] look at it and they call him with the
[2:14:07] the the cell phone the number of the
[2:14:10] sister
[2:14:13] and the pastor went
[2:14:16] he drove he went to the place that's the
[2:14:20] pasta version he said so
[2:14:23] when he reached the place he panicked
[2:14:26] he found the sister was killed
[2:14:30] and i said when he panicked and he he
[2:14:33] took
[2:14:34] the the shoes and the bag you want to
[2:14:37] put there
[2:14:38] and they realize that i can't do this
[2:14:39] because they can say i kill him i kill
[2:14:42] her
[2:14:43] and they want to go when he wants to go
[2:14:45] the police they follow him and something
[2:14:46] le pen and until
[2:14:48] he didn't stop and they arrest him they
[2:14:50] put him
[2:14:51] to jail they said echo the system now
[2:14:54] the police said this
[2:14:58] is vice versa it sometimes they can trap
[2:15:01] him
[2:15:02] sometimes he did it until today
[2:15:06] we don't know what happened but i gave
[2:15:08] you that story
[2:15:09] for you because sometimes things can
[2:15:12] happen in your life
[2:15:14] and what you can hear there the position
[2:15:16] you must take
[2:15:17] when you hear those things you hear
[2:15:21] you keep quiet you pray
[2:15:24] right that's that's what i'm telling you
[2:15:27] of this story
[2:15:28] there is a many story up there but this
[2:15:30] one is really disturbing me that's why i
[2:15:31] share with you i call you
[2:15:32] brother brother by the way say but
[2:15:35] joseph let's just pray
[2:15:37] that's why he answered and he told me i
[2:15:39] was this really disturbed so sometimes
[2:15:41] why god allow a servant of god to be in
[2:15:44] that such
[2:15:45] trap i don't know he did it
[2:15:49] i don't know why that happened
[2:15:52] we don't know the the police
[2:15:56] said this we saw egypt
[2:16:00] in jerusalem they called jeep all these
[2:16:02] 4x4 they call them cheap
[2:16:04] all these uh 4x4 toyota jeep
[2:16:08] whatever all these big 4x4 they call
[2:16:10] them jeepers
[2:16:11] we saw a jeep it come in that bush
[2:16:14] it through a dead body and
[2:16:18] that jeep come out we start to follow
[2:16:20] the jeep
[2:16:21] that car he didn't stop we follow we
[2:16:24] follow we follow
[2:16:26] until he didn't want to stop we stop him
[2:16:29] we stop him until
[2:16:30] it was the cow is was a lot a lot those
[2:16:33] cars
[2:16:33] and he stopped and we arrest him
[2:16:37] we put and behind we say that's the
[2:16:39] first
[2:16:40] suspect
[2:16:44] when i was say it a bit meet yourself i
[2:16:46] don't know you
[2:16:48] it's not the story because the story
[2:16:49] it's very complicated i don't know what
[2:16:51] happened
[2:16:52] god knows but where i was i was
[2:16:55] disturbed it is when they questioned the
[2:16:59] pastor
[2:17:00] it didn't mention the sister
[2:17:05] they said i'm sorry this is a mixed
[2:17:07] congregation
[2:17:09] they said even if this clothing of
[2:17:12] inside
[2:17:13] was in the pasta bag he said no no no no
[2:17:16] it was not in my bag it was in the back
[2:17:18] of
[2:17:19] this girl that's my problem
[2:17:24] it's not about the story we don't know
[2:17:26] what happened so when there is a problem
[2:17:28] she's not a sister anymore she becomes
[2:17:30] this girl
[2:17:33] and when as preachers we are relating
[2:17:36] that story
[2:17:37] we don't feel sorry for the sister who's
[2:17:40] dead
[2:17:40] we are feeling sorry for the pasta is
[2:17:43] exposed
[2:17:45] my second or my second concern
[2:17:49] it means they saw their pasta is more
[2:17:51] than they saw
[2:17:52] with that sister is dead that's where
[2:17:56] my problem is that's where i was
[2:17:58] traveling i said god that helped me to
[2:18:00] to to to suppress because i can't take
[2:18:03] it this normal because
[2:18:04] those reaction it's your hatred like
[2:18:08] she's my sister i don't know let me just
[2:18:10] give you an example from sister bill
[2:18:12] you fantastic whatever they said i
[2:18:14] killed her
[2:18:15] the way i love sister billa i can't even
[2:18:18] see how they arrest me
[2:18:20] how prison i'm going to i'll be just
[2:18:22] crying
[2:18:23] first my sister what's happened to my
[2:18:24] sister b work here
[2:18:26] sister bill you don't understand what
[2:18:28] i'm saying it's not about prison
[2:18:30] it's not about what but your body
[2:18:33] language
[2:18:34] can show which kind of christian you are
[2:18:38] your body language it can show
[2:18:42] which kind of person you want they give
[2:18:45] another question

[2:18:49] problem
[2:18:51] proud he's answering you know this
[2:18:54] problem
[2:18:55] happened you know it's uh
[2:18:58] it touched all pastors in the world
[2:19:01] preachers
[2:19:01] it didn't touch me because there is a
[2:19:04] wolf behind the puppet
[2:19:05] we know it there is which is sitting on
[2:19:07] the bench they are fighting the message
[2:19:09] they can sit here and they'll be there

[2:19:13] said there is a three kind of believer
[2:19:14] in any church
[2:19:15] we know it but we are preaching to the
[2:19:17] believer we don't care about them
[2:19:19] i mean i want them to be there to fight
[2:19:20] and i want to beat them like
