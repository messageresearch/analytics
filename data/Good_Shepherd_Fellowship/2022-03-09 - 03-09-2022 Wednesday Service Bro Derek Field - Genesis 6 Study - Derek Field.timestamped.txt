[55:24] bless us this evening
[55:26] and he'll speak to us
[55:28] it's already been a blessing to me
[55:31] and that's the thing is when we get
[55:32] together with saints of like precious
[55:34] faith
[55:36] if you're not receiving a blessing
[55:38] then there's something wrong
[55:41] with your relationship with the lord
[55:43] i don't come to give a blessing
[55:46] if that happens that comes from him
[55:48] they come to receive a blessing amen and
[55:51] may the lord bless us this evening
[55:54] let's pray
[55:55] heavenly father we thank you for your
[55:57] goodness
[55:58] we thank you for your love we thank you
[56:00] that you're the one who's watching over
[56:02] us
[56:03] in these dark
[56:04] and evil times
[56:06] and we ask you lord to come and be with
[56:08] us
[56:09] this evening and
[56:10] speak to us just a little out of your
[56:12] word lord
[56:14] that would encourage us that would
[56:16] strengthen us
[56:17] that would help us take another step
[56:20] with courage lord
[56:22] in the face of all that we face
[56:25] lord and it's not the david had no fear
[56:27] of goliath
[56:29] it was a fearful situation
[56:31] but he had an overcoming faith in this
[56:33] god
[56:34] may we have an overcoming faith and may
[56:36] our faith be strengthened this evening
[56:40] we ask in jesus name
[56:42] amen
[56:44] amen
[56:46] let's let's uh while you're standing
[56:48] let's grab our bibles
[56:50] thank you musicians
[56:52] uh and we'll just take a scripture and
[56:54] then i'll tell you where we're going
[56:55] when the scripture is
[56:56] matthew chapter
[56:58] 24
[57:00] and it's a familiar scripture and i
[57:02] don't think there's anything that we're
[57:04] going to bring out of here that we knew
[57:06] or un familiar to you but would trust
[57:09] that reminding you of these things
[57:12] will be a blessing
[57:16] so matthew chapter 24
[57:24] and we'll just wait on the sound person
[57:28] okay
[57:29] so
[57:33] and we'll take it from verse 36
[57:39] it says but of that day
[57:41] and thou are knoweth no man no not the
[57:43] angels of heaven
[57:45] but my father only
[57:47] but as the days of knowie were
[57:50] so or so shall also the coming of the
[57:53] son of man be
[57:55] for as in the days that were before the
[57:57] flood they were eating and drinking
[58:00] marrying and giving in marriage
[58:02] until the day that noah entered into the
[58:04] ark and knew not
[58:06] until the flood came and took them all
[58:08] away
[58:09] so also shall the coming of the son of
[58:13] man be
[58:14] may the lord add his blessing
[58:16] to the reading of his word and you may
[58:18] take your seats
[58:20] so
[58:23] i was walking down the road
[58:25] and how many of you actually listened to
[58:27] the bible
[58:29] uh
[58:31] anyone
[58:32] yeah
[58:33] okay and listen to the
[58:36] chapters and chapters at a time because
[58:38] sometimes you can pick up things that
[58:40] you can't if you just focus in on the
[58:42] verses
[58:43] and so i was listening
[58:45] to uh genesis
[58:47] and
[58:48] i heard in genesis where god was talking
[58:51] about
[58:52] noah
[58:54] and how noah found grace and i remember
[58:56] that jesus said
[58:58] that
[58:59] as it was in the days of noah and i
[59:01] thought to myself isn't that interesting
[59:03] if we looked at the days of noah and saw
[59:05] comparisons to today
[59:07] then we could tell are we living as it
[59:10] was in the days of noah so that's what
[59:12] we're going to do
[59:13] okay
[59:15] let's turn to genesis
[59:17] chapter 6
[59:19] because it taught that's where we find
[59:20] and it's the same scripture the same
[59:23] bible it's the same history that jesus
[59:25] had that we have today
[59:28] as it was in the days of noah
[59:31] it's the same record except jesus had
[59:33] the advantage that
[59:34] he had a little more spiritual
[59:36] understanding than us he had a better
[59:37] relationship with god but you see he was
[59:40] called to be the firstborn among many
[59:42] brethren and so that means that he
[59:45] didn't think it was robbery
[59:47] to be to say i'm equal with god and
[59:50] brothers and sisters we should have that
[59:51] attitude within us as well and that's
[59:54] quite something to say do you think it's
[59:56] robbery to think yourself as equal with
[1:00:00] god
[1:00:01] okay
[1:00:03] well that's what we're going to if we're
[1:00:04] going to adoption that's where we're
[1:00:06] going to brothers and sisters i i heard
[1:00:09] a wonderful quote one time it said
[1:00:11] a man should walk around with
[1:00:14] two hands in in his pockets i don't
[1:00:17] recommend you do this but
[1:00:18] in in one pocket should be i i am man
[1:00:22] i'm made
[1:00:24] in the image of god
[1:00:26] and in the other other pocket it should
[1:00:28] be i'm man
[1:00:29] i'm nothing but the dust of the earth
[1:00:32] you see and we should have the the
[1:00:34] ability and the wisdom to whatever the
[1:00:37] situation is to pull out the right thing
[1:00:40] okay
[1:00:41] when satan comes to attack us and to say
[1:00:45] you're nothing but the
[1:00:47] you you're just the dregs you you're
[1:00:49] awful
[1:00:50] we should put reach in our hand and say
[1:00:52] but
[1:00:53] i'm made in the image of god okay but if
[1:00:56] satan comes to attack you
[1:00:58] okay and he comes a different way and
[1:01:00] this takes more wisdom to see because
[1:01:02] you come and he'll attack you and say oh
[1:01:04] you're doing so good you're such a holy
[1:01:06] person you're such a wonderful person
[1:01:09] look at look at all of those out there
[1:01:11] they're not worthy to be compared to you
[1:01:13] you are just a wonderful christian and
[1:01:15] then you got to reach in the other
[1:01:17] pocket and say well
[1:01:18] yeah but i'm nothing but the dust of the
[1:01:20] earth i'm just a sinner say by grace so
[1:01:23] we need that balance there
[1:01:25] okay but jesus
[1:01:27] he saw he read exactly the same
[1:01:29] scripture and so we're going to go
[1:01:31] through we're going to do a little bible
[1:01:33] study and he says it came to pass and
[1:01:35] i'm going to bring out some of the facts
[1:01:37] that i looked up and that i researched
[1:01:39] it came to pass
[1:01:41] when men began to multiply on the face
[1:01:43] of the earth
[1:01:44] and daughters were born unto them
[1:01:47] well interesting men began to multiply
[1:01:50] on the face of the earth do you how many
[1:01:52] people know and we'll get interactive
[1:01:54] here if you if you like how many people
[1:01:57] know at the time of jesus
[1:02:00] what was the biggest city in the world
[1:02:03] anyone
[1:02:04] did someone say rome
[1:02:06] yeah that's right it was rome how many
[1:02:09] people
[1:02:10] were living in rome at the time of jesus
[1:02:12] anyone know that
[1:02:14] best estimate because
[1:02:16] no one's here today that was there then
[1:02:19] but best estimate is 800 000
[1:02:22] to a million people so there was a let's
[1:02:25] just say there were a million people
[1:02:27] living in the biggest city in the world
[1:02:28] at the time of jesus
[1:02:30] okay a million people
[1:02:33] uh
[1:02:35] how many
[1:02:37] cities
[1:02:38] are there in the world
[1:02:40] with over a million people living in
[1:02:42] them
[1:02:45] well i'm asking anyone have a guess
[1:02:54] five
[1:02:55] more than five
[1:02:58] did someone say a hundred
[1:03:00] more than a hundred
[1:03:03] not quite as many as five thousand all
[1:03:05] right
[1:03:06] the answer
[1:03:08] uh according to said 500
[1:03:11] well done the answer according to the uh
[1:03:16] to the un data in 1918 1916
[1:03:22] there were 512
[1:03:24] by 1918 i think uh or sorry
[1:03:28] 2016 by 2018
[1:03:32] there were 570. i don't know how many
[1:03:34] there are today but there's increasing
[1:03:37] the multitudes that grew on the face of
[1:03:40] the earth this multitude is a very
[1:03:42] interesting word turn with me to
[1:03:45] psalms
[1:03:46] chapter
[1:03:47] 144
[1:03:50] and just to
[1:03:52] you know sometimes you you get a picture
[1:03:54] of something
[1:03:55] from seeing a word
[1:03:57] that that's in the hebrew that's
[1:03:59] translated a slightly different way
[1:04:02] now how many of you
[1:04:05] uh
[1:04:06] for how many of you is english a second
[1:04:08] language
[1:04:10] yeah
[1:04:11] okay
[1:04:12] how many of you know more than one
[1:04:14] language
[1:04:16] yeah
[1:04:17] and you know you can take uh how many of
[1:04:19] you know more than two
[1:04:23] three
[1:04:24] by the way come on you should be raising
[1:04:26] your hand there
[1:04:27] and you know how how you can take a word
[1:04:29] in english
[1:04:31] and you can translate it into another
[1:04:34] language and it doesn't mean exactly the
[1:04:37] same thing
[1:04:39] but it's close enough that you can use
[1:04:41] it
[1:04:42] but then if you want to capture exactly
[1:04:45] that feeling and that that meaning of
[1:04:47] that word
[1:04:49] sometimes you have to use three four
[1:04:51] different kinds of words to say well
[1:04:52] it's kind of like this and like this and
[1:04:54] like this to build up a picture
[1:04:57] all right so that's what we're going to
[1:04:58] do tonight we're going to look in the
[1:05:00] scripture at these hebrew words that are
[1:05:02] used in genesis and we're going to try
[1:05:04] and build up a little picture of what it
[1:05:07] means and the first one we're going to
[1:05:08] look at is
[1:05:09] multiply
[1:05:11] and and in psalms
[1:05:13] 144
[1:05:15] and verse 14
[1:05:17] we find that uh
[1:05:20] we find that same word used
[1:05:23] sorry uh it's verse
[1:05:25] 13.
[1:05:27] all right
[1:05:31] and it says well it's a blessing and
[1:05:33] he's talking me of well we'll just go
[1:05:35] back to verse 11 he says rid me and
[1:05:37] deliver me from the hand of strange
[1:05:39] children
[1:05:40] whose mouth speak its vanity in their
[1:05:42] right hand is a right hand of falsehood
[1:05:45] that our sons may as be plants grown up
[1:05:47] in their youth that our daughters may be
[1:05:50] as cornerstones polished after the
[1:05:52] cementitude of palace
[1:05:54] of a palace that our ghanas may be full
[1:05:57] affording all manner of store that our
[1:05:59] sheep may bring forth thousands and ten
[1:06:02] thousands in our streets that our oxen
[1:06:04] may be strong to labor that there may be
[1:06:07] no breaking in nor going out that there
[1:06:09] may be no complaining in our streets
[1:06:12] that's where we're going
[1:06:14] okay but if you ever feel a little bit
[1:06:16] like complaining it's because you've got
[1:06:18] to get more in god and less in the world
[1:06:20] but anyway
[1:06:21] that
[1:06:22] word
[1:06:24] let's go back to oh we got let's go back
[1:06:26] to verse 13.
[1:06:31] okay
[1:06:32] may bring four thousands and ten
[1:06:34] thousands
[1:06:36] okay that word multiply
[1:06:39] is there ten thousands how many of you
[1:06:42] have seen the pictures of like in new
[1:06:43] york where you just have crowds of
[1:06:46] crowds of people and it's like a flock
[1:06:48] of sheep just bustling down and and in
[1:06:50] japan where they they pushed them into
[1:06:53] well not so much since since covered but
[1:06:55] they would push them into the the subway
[1:06:58] and they would just crowd them in
[1:06:59] they're just all jam-packed
[1:07:01] okay
[1:07:02] that's what we're talking about like
[1:07:05] sheep
[1:07:06] and that's why it's talking of the
[1:07:08] multitudes of people
[1:07:11] okay
[1:07:13] and the sons of god verse 2 back in
[1:07:15] genesis 6 the sons of that the sons of
[1:07:17] god saw the daughters of men that they
[1:07:19] were fair and they took them wives
[1:07:22] of all
[1:07:23] that they chose
[1:07:26] okay
[1:07:27] and wives
[1:07:29] well
[1:07:32] i looked up this statistic
[1:07:34] and it says um this is from uh
[1:07:39] uh the institute for family studies
[1:07:42] and the
[1:07:45] center for disease control did us a
[1:07:48] survey
[1:07:49] of people that lived together
[1:07:52] and
[1:07:53] taking all that data they estimated
[1:07:56] that
[1:07:58] 65 percent
[1:08:00] of people in the survey
[1:08:03] had lived with at least one romantic
[1:08:06] partner
[1:08:07] before marriage okay
[1:08:11] and many i think it was 50 55
[1:08:14] had said that they had had one
[1:08:17] uh at least one partner before
[1:08:21] the person that they were living with at
[1:08:22] that time and so we see that
[1:08:25] relationship between men and women
[1:08:28] is becoming
[1:08:30] uh well it's becoming evil let's think
[1:08:34] evil what is evil
[1:08:36] what is sin
[1:08:39] sin comes from a greek
[1:08:42] word
[1:08:44] and it's an archery word
[1:08:47] right okay
[1:08:49] and the archery
[1:08:51] you're aiming for a target how many
[1:08:53] people here have ever fired a bow
[1:08:56] okay
[1:08:57] and so
[1:08:58] when you fire a bow you're aiming for
[1:09:00] the center of a target
[1:09:04] and if you sin that means you missed
[1:09:07] what you were aiming at
[1:09:10] you miss what you were aiming at so what
[1:09:12] are we aiming at we're aiming at
[1:09:14] bringing the life of christ into our
[1:09:17] lives
[1:09:18] okay and so brothers and sisters this
[1:09:20] makes sin a lot more serious
[1:09:24] this makes sin a lot more deadly a lot
[1:09:27] with a lot more consequence because
[1:09:29] here's the thing
[1:09:30] you're you're there you're an archer
[1:09:33] you're aiming carefully
[1:09:35] all right and you're about to let go
[1:09:38] and and
[1:09:40] your friend comes along and he just
[1:09:42] jostles your elbow
[1:09:44] and the arrow shoots
[1:09:46] away
[1:09:47] i'm sorry
[1:09:48] you sinned
[1:09:50] right was it your phone no was that fool
[1:09:52] of a friend who decided to joshua your
[1:09:54] elbow just but you still missed the mark
[1:09:57] you still sinned
[1:09:59] okay
[1:10:00] you're aiming your arrow you're gonna
[1:10:02] hit the mark
[1:10:04] and you lose your arrow and just as you
[1:10:06] loose it
[1:10:07] when you've taken everything into
[1:10:08] account
[1:10:09] along comes a breeze of wind and
[1:10:12] you missed the mark you sinned
[1:10:15] and that's how it is in our life it
[1:10:16] doesn't matter what the reason is
[1:10:20] for us missing the mark
[1:10:22] if you miss the mark you have sinned
[1:10:25] that's right okay
[1:10:26] so then when you see that especially
[1:10:28] your young people and you think i i'm
[1:10:32] i get upset with my brother from time to
[1:10:34] time but i don't go out and rob banks
[1:10:37] and i don't go out and find old ladies
[1:10:39] and
[1:10:40] knock them on the head and take their
[1:10:42] purse
[1:10:43] i'm not a sinner
[1:10:46] well
[1:10:48] if you get angry with your brother
[1:10:50] like jesus said without a cause right
[1:10:53] how many have ever done i'm i confess
[1:10:56] i've done that
[1:10:57] why'd you do that
[1:10:59] there's something missing from my
[1:11:00] bedroom you took it didn't you
[1:11:03] i'm so mad with you
[1:11:05] and then a couple of days later it turns
[1:11:07] out that
[1:11:08] oh actually yeah i
[1:11:10] i moved there and i put oh
[1:11:13] i put it in the other room i forgot
[1:11:16] i was angry without a course
[1:11:19] okay
[1:11:20] i'm sorry you just sinned
[1:11:22] all right
[1:11:23] so you may not do anything that you
[1:11:25] think is really really bad or really
[1:11:27] terrible but if you're missing the mark
[1:11:30] that's right you've sinned
[1:11:33] and you need the grace of god
[1:11:36] all right
[1:11:38] so and the lord said my spirit shall not
[1:11:42] always strive
[1:11:43] with man
[1:11:45] for that he is also flesh
[1:11:47] yet his days shall be
[1:11:50] a hundred
[1:11:52] and twenty years and there were giants
[1:11:54] in the earth in those days
[1:11:56] also that after that when the sons of
[1:11:58] god came in unto the daughters of men
[1:12:00] and they bear
[1:12:01] children unto them they became mighty
[1:12:04] men which were of old
[1:12:05] men of renown you know that word giants
[1:12:09] anakim
[1:12:10] i believe it is
[1:12:12] that only appears two times
[1:12:15] in the scripture
[1:12:16] did you you knew that
[1:12:18] okay
[1:12:19] how many people know where it appears
[1:12:21] out in the scripture
[1:12:23] let's go there let's go to numbers
[1:12:26] chapter 13.
[1:12:43] i like this
[1:12:51] all right
[1:12:53] so this is going into the promised land
[1:12:56] how many people here want to go into the
[1:12:58] promised land into the fullness of the
[1:13:00] promised land you had a little taste
[1:13:02] okay and you know it's there for you
[1:13:05] but you haven't got to the fullness yet
[1:13:08] you know there's more and you want to
[1:13:09] enter in well there's something stopping
[1:13:11] you entering entering in and and usually
[1:13:14] that's something in your mind and let's
[1:13:16] have a look what was in the mind of
[1:13:18] these people
[1:13:19] okay
[1:13:21] from verse 26
[1:13:23] and they went and came unto moses and to
[1:13:25] aaron and to all the congregation of the
[1:13:27] children of israel unto the wilderness
[1:13:29] of paran to kadesh and brought back word
[1:13:32] unto them and to all the congregation
[1:13:34] showed them the fruit of the land
[1:13:36] and they told them and said we came unto
[1:13:38] the land whether thou sentest us and
[1:13:41] surely it floweth with milk and honey
[1:13:43] and this is the fruit of it nevertheless
[1:13:45] the people
[1:13:47] that be strong would be strong that
[1:13:49] dwell in the land
[1:13:51] the city's a ward
[1:13:54] and very great
[1:13:55] and moreover we saw the children of anak
[1:13:58] there
[1:13:59] and the amalekites dwell in the land sat
[1:14:01] land of the south and the hittites and
[1:14:03] the jebusites the amorites dwell in the
[1:14:05] mountains the canaanites dwell by the
[1:14:07] sea
[1:14:08] by the coast of jordan
[1:14:13] what are the what are all those people
[1:14:15] representing
[1:14:17] okay
[1:14:19] so there's a battle
[1:14:21] to enter in
[1:14:22] to the holy land and the children of
[1:14:25] israel had to enter in but every step of
[1:14:28] their journey is a representation
[1:14:30] of a step in our journey
[1:14:33] and so
[1:14:34] every battle that they fought is
[1:14:36] representation of a battle that we have
[1:14:38] to for fight ourselves
[1:14:41] as a church
[1:14:42] as a church age and as an individual
[1:14:45] but sometimes it's easy to say oh we've
[1:14:47] got to fight as a church and that's
[1:14:48] wonderful and and you can think
[1:14:51] okay
[1:14:52] as a group as a church aide we're going
[1:14:54] to enter and praise the lord but
[1:14:56] where it really
[1:14:58] starts to get difficult is when you say
[1:15:01] it's me
[1:15:02] it's not anybody else it's me and i have
[1:15:07] my giants to fight
[1:15:09] okay
[1:15:11] so
[1:15:12] and this is this is something like i
[1:15:14] said this this is just a couple of weeks
[1:15:16] old and i've just seen something new
[1:15:17] here but i'll show it to you
[1:15:19] all right
[1:15:20] i have something to fight
[1:15:22] i have something to overcome
[1:15:24] i have something to
[1:15:26] and and okay how many people
[1:15:29] are looking at their lives and saying
[1:15:31] there's something that's a bit too big
[1:15:32] for me to overcome
[1:15:35] yeah put your hand up
[1:15:37] yeah
[1:15:38] talia if you're not putting your hand up
[1:15:40] you haven't looked at your life close
[1:15:42] enough
[1:15:44] okay because god didn't call you to
[1:15:46] overcome easy things
[1:15:49] all right
[1:15:51] so if something is easy for you to
[1:15:52] overcome you should overcome it god
[1:15:55] isn't going to help you with that
[1:15:57] he's already helped you with it most
[1:15:59] likely
[1:16:00] it's the hard things that you say i've
[1:16:02] got to go against this in the faith of
[1:16:05] god because i don't have any way of
[1:16:11] i can't stand against it myself
[1:16:14] but i i can stand against it with god's
[1:16:16] help because he is bigger than what the
[1:16:19] problem is
[1:16:20] all right so mul caleb stealed the
[1:16:22] people before moses said let us go up at
[1:16:25] once and possess it for we are well able
[1:16:29] to overcome it and this is the battle
[1:16:31] and the battles in the mind you
[1:16:32] reference that okay and you're going to
[1:16:34] have
[1:16:35] i see the goodness i see the promises
[1:16:38] all right
[1:16:40] but i see how they can apply to me
[1:16:44] but the problem is
[1:16:46] they don't apply to me because of
[1:16:49] you know
[1:16:50] i'm not living quite right
[1:16:52] well
[1:16:53] what's that got to do with it right
[1:16:56] they don't apply to me because
[1:16:58] because
[1:17:00] my foot is really painful and it's
[1:17:01] probably i can't claim it in faith
[1:17:04] because what if i claim it in faith
[1:17:07] and and it doesn't get healed
[1:17:10] sure
[1:17:11] oh man
[1:17:12] that would be kind of awkward because if
[1:17:15] i go out and i tell people when nothing
[1:17:17] happens
[1:17:20] and there's a little voice that said no
[1:17:22] no no no we're able to you're able to
[1:17:24] possess it
[1:17:25] all right
[1:17:27] and then you gotta you got a choice to
[1:17:29] make and the men that went up with him
[1:17:31] said we be not able to go up against the
[1:17:33] people for they are stronger than we
[1:17:35] they brought up an evil report of the
[1:17:37] land which they'd searched unto the
[1:17:39] children of israel saying the land
[1:17:41] through which we've gone to search it is
[1:17:43] a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[1:17:45] thereof
[1:17:46] and all the people that we saw are men
[1:17:48] of great stature and we saw the giants
[1:17:51] the sons of anak which will come of the
[1:17:54] giants
[1:17:56] okay
[1:17:57] which will come of the giants and we
[1:17:59] were in our own site as grasshoppers
[1:18:02] and so we were in their sight all right
[1:18:06] so basically what's it saying the the
[1:18:08] thing
[1:18:11] that you can't overcome
[1:18:15] is born
[1:18:17] of the sons of god and the daughters of
[1:18:18] men because that word giants that's the
[1:18:20] same one that's back in genesis what's
[1:18:22] that that's talking about serpent seed
[1:18:24] that's talking about fleshly religion
[1:18:26] okay that's talking about that mindset
[1:18:29] that says i'm walking
[1:18:31] in godliness in the flesh
[1:18:34] and we can't overcome that because i'm
[1:18:37] like a grasshopper
[1:18:40] and sisters
[1:18:41] do you ever feel like a grasshopper
[1:18:44] yeah yeah okay
[1:18:46] listen if you don't feel like a
[1:18:48] grasshopper
[1:18:50] you haven't been paying attention
[1:18:54] i'm telling you you haven't been paying
[1:18:56] attention
[1:18:59] twitter
[1:19:01] the social media platforms
[1:19:03] took the sitting president
[1:19:06] of the united states
[1:19:08] completely
[1:19:09] out of communication
[1:19:12] because they didn't like what he said
[1:19:14] and didn't like what he did and now i'm
[1:19:15] not here to agree or disagree with what
[1:19:17] he said what he did but i'm pointing out
[1:19:19] that using that kind of power
[1:19:24] now has a president it was unprecedented
[1:19:28] but now they've used it against the most
[1:19:31] powerful man in the world and said
[1:19:32] doesn't matter how powerful you are we
[1:19:34] want to switch you off we can switch you
[1:19:36] off we can switch you off
[1:19:38] okay
[1:19:40] how many people ever been to canada
[1:19:44] yeah nice gentle canada first world
[1:19:46] country
[1:19:48] people want to go to canada
[1:19:51] and then there was that that truckers
[1:19:54] and the the
[1:19:56] prime minister of canada declared an
[1:19:57] emergency situation
[1:20:01] and they they basically they said the
[1:20:03] truckers are loaded terrorists
[1:20:06] yeah you didn't see that
[1:20:08] oh look it up
[1:20:10] yeah jordan will tell you
[1:20:12] but
[1:20:13] uh
[1:20:14] and they said anyone who sent money to
[1:20:17] them
[1:20:19] we order we give the banks permission
[1:20:22] that if you even think
[1:20:24] that someone sent money to them
[1:20:27] you can suspend their account and they
[1:20:29] don't have any recourse
[1:20:33] yeah how many you know that how many
[1:20:35] people know that
[1:20:36] okay
[1:20:37] all right if you didn't know that
[1:20:40] then maybe you can start feeling like a
[1:20:41] grasshopper because all it takes
[1:20:44] is for okay
[1:20:45] how many of you support um
[1:20:48] the voice of god ministries i think we
[1:20:50] support it
[1:20:51] okay
[1:20:52] all it takes for them to say is
[1:20:54] you know what that voice of god's
[1:20:56] terrorist organization
[1:20:58] shut it down and
[1:21:01] go back for the past 10 years
[1:21:04] see anyone who's ever given money to
[1:21:06] them
[1:21:07] shut them down as well
[1:21:10] okay
[1:21:11] start feeling like a grasshopper
[1:21:14] all right
[1:21:16] there's nothing that you can do against
[1:21:18] that
[1:21:19] okay
[1:21:22] well
[1:21:24] but we're not called to be grasshoppers
[1:21:26] even if we feel like grasshoppers we're
[1:21:27] called to overcome but there you see
[1:21:30] these were the giants that were in the
[1:21:32] land in the time and they're in our land
[1:21:34] as well so move over giants
[1:21:37] so
[1:21:40] here's a really interesting one
[1:21:44] verse 5
[1:21:47] and god saw
[1:21:49] that the wickedness of man was
[1:21:52] great on the earth and that every
[1:21:54] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:21:57] was only evil continually
[1:22:00] oh
[1:22:01] every imagination
[1:22:03] and we think of imagination it's like ah
[1:22:07] i can imagine
[1:22:09] you know imagine one day if
[1:22:12] brother one really annoys me i can just
[1:22:14] imagine strangling him
[1:22:16] okay
[1:22:18] is that the kind of imagination we're
[1:22:19] talking about
[1:22:21] all right what does that word
[1:22:23] imagination mean
[1:22:25] that's really interesting how many
[1:22:27] people work in construction here
[1:22:30] anyone
[1:22:31] okay
[1:22:32] let's turn to uh
[1:22:35] isaiah
[1:22:38] 29.
[1:22:40] i'm going to give you two scriptures
[1:22:41] from isaiah just to try and talk about
[1:22:44] what this
[1:22:46] word imagination is because we think of
[1:22:48] imagination it's something that you know
[1:22:51] oh i wish i could do that oh i'm
[1:22:53] imagining doing something
[1:22:55] and we think that every imagination
[1:22:58] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[1:23:00] evil
[1:23:02] wicked continually
[1:23:04] they were always just imagining what bad
[1:23:06] thing they could do to someone else
[1:23:08] that's
[1:23:09] part of it but let's have a look at this
[1:23:11] part
[1:23:14] this is isaiah 29
[1:23:17] uh and verse well let's start in verse
[1:23:20] 15 just to
[1:23:26] it says uh
[1:23:27] woe unto them that seek
[1:23:29] deep to hide their counsel from the lord
[1:23:32] and their works are in the deep and they
[1:23:34] say who seeth us and who knoweth us
[1:23:37] surely your turnings of things upside
[1:23:40] down shall be esteemed as the potter's
[1:23:42] clay
[1:23:43] for shall the works say of him that made
[1:23:45] it he made me not
[1:23:47] or shall the thing framed serve him that
[1:23:49] framed it he has no understanding
[1:23:51] where's imagination in here
[1:23:55] next next one
[1:23:59] 16.
[1:24:02] where's imagination in here
[1:24:08] anyone care to venture
[1:24:13] no okay it's this word framed
[1:24:18] okay
[1:24:19] shall the thing imagine save him who
[1:24:21] imagined it all right but it's not
[1:24:24] imagined it's framed and
[1:24:27] how many people have seen the house
[1:24:28] framed
[1:24:30] okay
[1:24:31] and so what's the framework of a house
[1:24:34] all right
[1:24:35] it's it's the you've got the foundations
[1:24:38] and then you put up the supports on
[1:24:41] which you hang
[1:24:43] everything else
[1:24:45] and so
[1:24:47] you you've talked about uh have you ever
[1:24:49] talked about the way you frame a
[1:24:51] conversation
[1:24:53] the way you think about things the
[1:24:55] mindset that you bring into something
[1:24:58] that's the imagination that's exactly
[1:25:01] the same word as imagination back in
[1:25:03] genesis
[1:25:04] so when you say the imagination was
[1:25:06] wicked always it means the frame the
[1:25:09] point of view that they looked at the
[1:25:11] world it wasn't that oh i'm i'm
[1:25:13] imagining strangling somebody or i'm
[1:25:16] imagining robbing somebody it's the way
[1:25:19] you look at the world is always
[1:25:21] continually evil
[1:25:24] okay
[1:25:26] so let's look at an example of that just
[1:25:28] a real
[1:25:29] brief example of that
[1:25:32] uh there are lots of uh there are lots
[1:25:35] of examples that we could look at but uh
[1:25:37] we can just
[1:25:39] take our one
[1:25:45] cutting your hair as a as a woman
[1:25:48] okay
[1:25:50] and
[1:25:51] god says don't do it
[1:25:54] all right
[1:25:55] but how many people in this world
[1:25:58] believe
[1:25:59] that it's wrong for a woman to cut their
[1:26:01] hair
[1:26:03] very very few
[1:26:05] because it's
[1:26:06] everywhere
[1:26:08] it's in all the churches
[1:26:10] it's in all the workplaces
[1:26:13] it's in it's it's everywhere you look
[1:26:16] all right
[1:26:18] and so
[1:26:20] for a little person that grows up into
[1:26:22] this world that's just natural to think
[1:26:24] that way their imagination has been
[1:26:27] framed by their surroundings and framed
[1:26:30] into a world of sin
[1:26:33] okay and so we're looking at saying
[1:26:35] what's the weevil imaginations now what
[1:26:37] we have to do is we have to be careful
[1:26:41] that we don't get infected by the
[1:26:44] world's framings
[1:26:47] okay
[1:26:50] uh
[1:26:53] because i
[1:26:54] this is how we all like sheep have gone
[1:26:56] astray
[1:26:57] all right
[1:26:59] this is how
[1:27:00] stupid
[1:27:02] we are
[1:27:03] human beings
[1:27:05] you
[1:27:07] and me everyone
[1:27:09] okay they did a test
[1:27:12] and
[1:27:13] here's how the test went
[1:27:16] they stopped the person walking down the
[1:27:18] road
[1:27:20] and they asked him hey
[1:27:22] would you hold this for me
[1:27:24] while i tie my shoelaces
[1:27:26] it was a cup of coffee
[1:27:28] okay
[1:27:29] and then you tied the shoelaces thank
[1:27:31] you very much
[1:27:33] they tracked that person
[1:27:36] and
[1:27:37] they would invite that person
[1:27:39] to come and have a
[1:27:43] like a little survey
[1:27:45] and so a bit further down the road
[1:27:47] they'd say hey um
[1:27:50] would you help us out we're doing a
[1:27:51] survey all we want you to do is we want
[1:27:54] you just to read this description of a
[1:27:56] person
[1:27:57] it's just a paragraph
[1:27:59] and tell us
[1:28:01] whether you think
[1:28:02] they're warm-hearted
[1:28:04] or whether you think they're
[1:28:06] cold-hearted
[1:28:08] okay
[1:28:10] and so
[1:28:11] they gave their opinion oh i read this
[1:28:13] person he seems like he's warm-hearted
[1:28:15] read this person seem like he's
[1:28:17] cold-hearted how many people have heard
[1:28:19] of this experiment
[1:28:21] okay you can look it up
[1:28:22] yeah elijah's heard of it because he's
[1:28:24] heard me talk about this before
[1:28:27] okay that's my son elijah in the back
[1:28:31] so
[1:28:32] the trick was this
[1:28:33] right at the beginning they will either
[1:28:35] give them a cup of hot coffee
[1:28:37] or a cup of iced coffee
[1:28:42] and they would hold that cup of coffee
[1:28:44] just for a few brief minutes they will
[1:28:46] go down the road and about 60 or 70
[1:28:49] percent i don't remember the exact
[1:28:50] figures of people that held the hot cup
[1:28:54] said oh that person he seems like a
[1:28:55] warm-hearted person and 60 or 70 percent
[1:28:59] of people that held the cold cup was
[1:29:01] like oh that that guy feels like a
[1:29:03] cold-hearted person
[1:29:06] okay
[1:29:07] that's how susceptible
[1:29:09] you are
[1:29:12] to
[1:29:13] your surroundings
[1:29:15] that's how much you need the grace of
[1:29:16] god
[1:29:17] okay
[1:29:19] all right
[1:29:20] we won't go on to subliminal advertising
[1:29:24] and all the ways that they manipulate
[1:29:25] you but the devil absolutely uses that
[1:29:28] against us and against you and every
[1:29:29] time you go
[1:29:31] into a shopping mall every time you go
[1:29:34] to school every time you go to church
[1:29:38] not here but you know to visit someone
[1:29:40] every time you interact with someone and
[1:29:42] we'll just we'll stick on that short
[1:29:44] hair just for a second that cut hair and
[1:29:46] you're interacting with somebody with
[1:29:49] cut hair
[1:29:51] okay and you're accepting of them
[1:29:53] because you have to be
[1:29:55] the devil is framing your mind into an
[1:29:58] evil imagination to say
[1:30:00] what's the difference if i cut my hair
[1:30:02] or not
[1:30:04] okay and that's especially true for your
[1:30:07] young people
[1:30:09] for the sisters young sisters that's
[1:30:11] true
[1:30:12] all right
[1:30:13] there are other pressures we'll just
[1:30:15] stick on
[1:30:16] on that for right now but you understand
[1:30:18] the imagination
[1:30:21] so what's the cure
[1:30:22] let's turn to isaiah 26 just back a
[1:30:26] couple
[1:30:27] of
[1:30:28] pages
[1:30:30] and you know this scripture
[1:30:33] okay you know this scripture
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:43] isaiah 26 3. bring it up here
[1:30:49] for thou will keep him
[1:30:51] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:30:53] thee
[1:30:54] because he trusteth in thee
[1:30:57] that's right okay
[1:30:59] trust ye in the lord forever for in the
[1:31:02] lord jehovah's everlasting strength
[1:31:05] all right
[1:31:06] let's go back
[1:31:09] that will keep him in perfect peace
[1:31:11] whose imagination
[1:31:14] is stayed on you it's exactly the same
[1:31:16] word
[1:31:18] okay
[1:31:19] whose imagination is stayed on me so how
[1:31:22] are you going to
[1:31:25] brothers and sisters this
[1:31:27] tells us the essential importance of
[1:31:29] reading your bible and praying every day
[1:31:31] why because it frames your mind around
[1:31:34] the word of god stays your mind on jesus
[1:31:38] oh
[1:31:40] how long do you usually
[1:31:54] all right not what you think it's the
[1:31:56] way you think it's the way your mind is
[1:31:58] framed and the law and it repented the
[1:32:00] lord
[1:32:01] that he had made man on earth and it
[1:32:03] grieved him
[1:32:04] at his heart
[1:32:07] oh man
[1:32:09] so i want to take you into the mind of
[1:32:11] god and i want to take you into our
[1:32:12] minds for a little bit by turning to
[1:32:14] nehemiah
[1:32:17] chapter
[1:32:18] eight
[1:32:23] and this is this is a an amazing story
[1:32:26] and the children of israel come back
[1:32:27] from captivity
[1:32:29] and they're doing their best
[1:32:33] to
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:36] to
[1:32:37] well i'm going to tell you the story and
[1:32:39] then we're going to read a bit
[1:32:41] all right they they get everybody
[1:32:43] together they get everybody together and
[1:32:45] they're rebuilding jerusalem they're
[1:32:46] rebuilding the temple and they say we
[1:32:48] need to get back to god
[1:32:49] and it's actually if you're if you're
[1:32:51] you can discern the seeds of the
[1:32:53] pharisees in this
[1:32:55] because this is the the pharisees took
[1:32:57] this idea too far we need to keep the
[1:33:00] law of god before we get kicked out of
[1:33:02] the land but
[1:33:04] they gather together
[1:33:06] ezra
[1:33:08] reads the law to them and the levites
[1:33:10] make plain the understanding of the law
[1:33:12] and they're all and he reads all day
[1:33:14] ezra the scribe and near maya the the uh
[1:33:17] the governor
[1:33:19] and the priests and they bless the
[1:33:20] people and they
[1:33:22] verse 7 so they read in the book of the
[1:33:24] law of god distinctly and gave them the
[1:33:27] sense and caused them to understand the
[1:33:30] weeping
[1:33:31] i understand the reading and nehemiah
[1:33:33] which is the terth shatter or which
[1:33:35] means the governor and ezra the priest
[1:33:38] the scribe and the levites that
[1:33:40] taught the people said unto the people
[1:33:41] this day is holy unto the lord your god
[1:33:44] mourn not nor weep for all the people
[1:33:46] wept when they heard
[1:33:49] the word
[1:33:50] of the lord
[1:33:52] okay mourn it's the same as grieved
[1:33:56] all right
[1:33:57] so what is it
[1:33:59] god created the earth
[1:34:02] to be a place of joy for him
[1:34:04] to be a place where he could find
[1:34:07] relaxation comfort
[1:34:10] where he could find
[1:34:11] an equal someone to talk with
[1:34:14] you know
[1:34:15] because your parents know how it is
[1:34:19] you have to talk to your kids
[1:34:21] it's annoying
[1:34:23] i love you kids okay
[1:34:25] all right and your parents love you
[1:34:27] okay
[1:34:29] but you talk to your kids and it's all
[1:34:32] can i can i have this
[1:34:34] can i have this
[1:34:36] can i have this
[1:34:38] no
[1:34:40] why does that why does this why does
[1:34:42] that
[1:34:43] and you're talking
[1:34:45] from up here to down here
[1:34:47] because that's about how high luke is
[1:34:49] to down here that's how high tiffany is
[1:34:52] it can be difficult
[1:34:53] and it's like man
[1:34:55] ah
[1:34:57] can i can i just have some adult
[1:34:59] conversation
[1:35:01] please
[1:35:02] but think of it and there's a relief
[1:35:04] there and and there's a talking and
[1:35:06] that's that's a man and a woman and
[1:35:08] they're talking together as equal as
[1:35:10] husbands and wives and you're saying i
[1:35:12] understand what you're saying that's
[1:35:13] interesting and
[1:35:15] and that's that's what god created man
[1:35:17] for
[1:35:18] not to talk down to him and say i did
[1:35:21] you know
[1:35:22] but to talk as equals to him
[1:35:25] and to be hey come and have a
[1:35:27] conversation come let us reason together
[1:35:30] okay
[1:35:31] oh i love the way you're thinking
[1:35:33] you know
[1:35:35] um
[1:35:37] that you know what the nice thing is
[1:35:39] elisha and emma
[1:35:41] they're my two big ones
[1:35:43] okay
[1:35:44] they've got older
[1:35:47] they got wiser they start to mature
[1:35:49] and suddenly it goes from being like can
[1:35:51] i have this can i have why can't i do
[1:35:53] that why can't i do that like oh dad
[1:35:56] isn't it interesting that this happens
[1:35:59] and this happens like yeah it is what do
[1:36:01] you make of that well i think it's like
[1:36:04] i like the way you're thinking
[1:36:06] because now we're starting to talk as
[1:36:08] equals
[1:36:09] okay because brothers and sisters you're
[1:36:12] not raising children
[1:36:14] okay
[1:36:15] you're raising adults
[1:36:17] that's the goal is to have an adult have
[1:36:19] a functioning adult at the end of the
[1:36:21] process
[1:36:23] okay not to have a little baby
[1:36:26] okay you think you think you know what
[1:36:27] the problem with society is
[1:36:30] it's we're raising babies
[1:36:33] we're not raising adults
[1:36:36] raising people who still get told what
[1:36:38] to think and can't think for themselves
[1:36:41] so it's a source of pride for me
[1:36:44] that elisha and emma
[1:36:47] i can have conversations with them that
[1:36:49] are actual conversations
[1:36:51] i
[1:36:52] they still bug me sometimes but it's
[1:36:54] getting less and less you know
[1:36:57] but that's what god has raised us up
[1:37:00] raise you and me this is what creation
[1:37:03] is about for him to have that
[1:37:05] conversation
[1:37:06] and it grieved him because there was no
[1:37:09] one left in the world
[1:37:11] with whom he could have that
[1:37:12] conversation
[1:37:14] it grieved him
[1:37:17] and in our mind sometimes we read ah
[1:37:21] you read the book of acts and you see
[1:37:23] the great things god did
[1:37:26] and it grieves you so because where's my
[1:37:29] life in comparison to that
[1:37:31] where am i
[1:37:33] and god says
[1:37:35] now hold on
[1:37:36] this is the day of the lord
[1:37:39] it's not a day for mourning and weeping
[1:37:42] it's a day
[1:37:44] to raise yourself up to say
[1:37:46] you know what these are the promises yes
[1:37:48] that i can enter into
[1:37:51] these are the promises that i have this
[1:37:53] isn't oh what was me because you can get
[1:37:56] stuck in that attitude for sure
[1:37:58] and there's a genuineness to that and
[1:38:00] the people that cried and wept we
[1:38:02] haven't kept the law of god
[1:38:05] and the priest said no no no no
[1:38:07] this is a day
[1:38:08] of
[1:38:10] go eat the fat
[1:38:12] go drink the sweet and send portions to
[1:38:14] them who nothing is prepared
[1:38:16] for this days holy unto
[1:38:19] our lord neither be sorry for the joy of
[1:38:21] the lord is your strength
[1:38:24] that's where that comes from isn't that
[1:38:25] good
[1:38:27] so it repented me and he said i will
[1:38:29] destroy man from the face of the earth
[1:38:33] that i have created from the face of the
[1:38:35] earth both man and beast
[1:38:37] creeping thing the fowls of the effort
[1:38:39] repenteth me
[1:38:41] that i've made them
[1:38:45] but noah
[1:38:47] found grace
[1:38:49] in the eyes of the lord
[1:38:52] and
[1:38:56] let's turn to esther chapter five
[1:38:59] and we see that word translated
[1:39:02] another way
[1:39:06] so brothers and sisters you you think of
[1:39:08] this for a moment
[1:39:11] all right the esther is a book in the
[1:39:13] bible
[1:39:15] that doesn't actually
[1:39:18] have the name of god in it
[1:39:21] okay
[1:39:24] isn't that interesting that god would
[1:39:26] say this is going to be my book
[1:39:29] and in my book
[1:39:30] i am going to have
[1:39:32] a book
[1:39:34] that doesn't even mention my name
[1:39:37] it just testifies of me without saying
[1:39:40] anything about me
[1:39:42] okay
[1:39:44] and so sometimes you get the idea that
[1:39:48] don't get me wrong here all right
[1:39:50] there's a balance in the scriptures
[1:39:52] the bible says do all things in the name
[1:39:54] of jesus
[1:39:55] in the name of the lord but esther is
[1:39:57] written
[1:39:58] without the name of the lord
[1:40:00] so sometimes things are a little
[1:40:02] different to the way we think we should
[1:40:04] they should be to the way god says let
[1:40:06] them come forth
[1:40:08] and so if you see something where god is
[1:40:11] you don't know if god is moving or not
[1:40:14] because it doesn't seem to be in the
[1:40:15] name of the lord
[1:40:17] just take it easy
[1:40:20] wait and see what develops because god
[1:40:22] works in so many ways
[1:40:25] all right but he here we are
[1:40:28] and this is
[1:40:31] well you know the story of esther
[1:40:34] chapter one it uh verse one and it came
[1:40:36] to pass on the third day that esther put
[1:40:38] on her royal apparel and stood in the
[1:40:41] inner court of the king's house over
[1:40:43] against the king's house and the king
[1:40:45] sat on his royal throne
[1:40:50] in the royal house over against the gate
[1:40:52] of the house and it was so when the king
[1:40:54] saw esther the queen standing in the
[1:40:55] court now we'll stop there
[1:40:58] and and we'll pause all right
[1:41:00] because let's think about this situation
[1:41:02] here esther as she had said to mordecai
[1:41:07] and mordecai had agreed with her was
[1:41:09] taking her life
[1:41:11] into her hands by doing that we think of
[1:41:14] the king and queen you know it's like
[1:41:16] the king and the queen but it wasn't the
[1:41:17] king and the queen
[1:41:19] it was the king
[1:41:20] and the favored wife
[1:41:23] of many wives
[1:41:25] okay
[1:41:27] and so there's the king and he's in his
[1:41:29] core and he's running
[1:41:31] a worldwide empire
[1:41:34] he's running the biggest empire that
[1:41:36] civilization had known up to that point
[1:41:40] and there's some thought that's very
[1:41:42] interesting that
[1:41:44] esther chapter one the feast
[1:41:48] uh that he had
[1:41:50] was the feast that uh where he was
[1:41:53] planning the invasion of greece
[1:41:56] okay so he's called his captains
[1:41:58] together to have a feast and then to
[1:42:00] actually strategize on
[1:42:02] the world stage and how many of you
[1:42:06] husbands
[1:42:08] sometimes maybe you're not strategizing
[1:42:10] quite on the world stage but you're
[1:42:12] really focused in on something
[1:42:15] like
[1:42:17] i have to put this together for work and
[1:42:19] let's say it's important for work it's a
[1:42:20] project
[1:42:22] that you've been given you've got to do
[1:42:23] well and and you're at home and you're
[1:42:25] working on the project and you just 100
[1:42:29] focused in
[1:42:33] and the wife comes
[1:42:36] she's like
[1:42:37] honey can we talk
[1:42:41] like i'm busy
[1:42:44] but it's really important
[1:42:46] but i'm really busy and you've already
[1:42:49] broken off my train of thought and i've
[1:42:50] really this is really important
[1:42:54] well honey don't you love me
[1:42:57] off with a head
[1:43:00] don't bother me woman this is important
[1:43:02] stuff
[1:43:04] okay
[1:43:05] so that's kind of funny
[1:43:07] at least for me maybe not for your
[1:43:09] sisters
[1:43:10] okay but that's the situation that was
[1:43:13] the kind of situation that esther was
[1:43:16] putting herself into
[1:43:18] it's like yes i love you esther yeah
[1:43:20] you're the best one of the lot that they
[1:43:23] brought before me but i had you know
[1:43:25] maybe 300 maybe it was a year worth of
[1:43:28] fair maidens coming into my bed chamber
[1:43:31] i liked you the best and i made you my
[1:43:33] favorite wife but don't think i don't
[1:43:35] have options
[1:43:37] don't bug me i'm busy i will call for
[1:43:40] you
[1:43:42] well
[1:43:44] just remember brothers that's not the
[1:43:46] way god ordained marriage okay
[1:43:49] so
[1:43:50] because very often
[1:43:52] it's that's
[1:43:54] when you're talking to your wife
[1:43:57] you've got to remember god gave her to
[1:43:59] you
[1:44:01] to
[1:44:03] help you
[1:44:04] find the right way
[1:44:08] and very often where you get so focused
[1:44:10] in on something and your wife is like ah
[1:44:12] this is really bugging me
[1:44:14] why is it bugging her
[1:44:16] sure
[1:44:17] okay because
[1:44:18] she's a woman of god
[1:44:21] and take the time to listen
[1:44:23] all right
[1:44:26] don't be
[1:44:27] don't be like off with her head
[1:44:29] no
[1:44:32] but you know where you know that level
[1:44:33] of frustration well that's just
[1:44:35] that's that's sin that's missing the
[1:44:37] mark okay
[1:44:39] all right but we're all subject to sin
[1:44:41] at the moment the giants that flesh that
[1:44:43] born within us that we should be
[1:44:45] fighting against anyway and when it
[1:44:48] seems so big and frustrating that's
[1:44:50] right you seem like a grasshopper but
[1:44:52] that's what you have faith in god to
[1:44:53] overcome
[1:44:55] but
[1:44:56] she's standing there
[1:44:59] between life and death do you understand
[1:45:01] that
[1:45:02] she's taken her life into her hands it's
[1:45:06] been so serious that she fasted and
[1:45:08] prayed for three days
[1:45:11] when was the last time you fasted and
[1:45:13] prayed for three days about one
[1:45:15] particular thing
[1:45:17] to make sure that when you stepped
[1:45:20] into
[1:45:21] the arena
[1:45:23] you were stepping with god behind you
[1:45:25] and you still didn't know
[1:45:28] whether it was right or wrong
[1:45:30] what would happen
[1:45:32] so
[1:45:34] don't think this is some kind of fairy
[1:45:36] tale this is esther took her life into
[1:45:38] her hands
[1:45:40] and she obtained favor
[1:45:42] in his sight
[1:45:44] and that's the same word as grace noah
[1:45:47] found grace esther obtained favor
[1:45:51] and so there was something about noah
[1:45:52] that said to god
[1:45:55] although the world is full of sin
[1:45:58] although
[1:45:59] the imagination of every man's heart is
[1:46:01] wicked
[1:46:03] although death is coming
[1:46:05] yet i can extend the golden scepter
[1:46:09] for noah to touch
[1:46:12] and to say i identify and i thank you
[1:46:14] not because i'm worthy
[1:46:16] but because you chose me and there's
[1:46:19] something in you
[1:46:22] there's something in you in god
[1:46:25] that says
[1:46:28] i like you
[1:46:32] no
[1:46:33] you ever had that conversation i have
[1:46:34] that conversation with my wife from time
[1:46:36] to time
[1:46:37] i like you
[1:46:39] why
[1:46:41] what is it you've seen me i don't know
[1:46:44] you're so annoying sometimes but i still
[1:46:46] like you
[1:46:48] okay
[1:46:50] what are you laughing at over there
[1:46:52] yeah okay cross cultures this is this
[1:46:55] isn't just
[1:46:56] all right
[1:46:57] this is the human experience
[1:47:01] and god says i like you
[1:47:03] there's something about you you are
[1:47:05] really annoying sometimes
[1:47:07] and you do need to be cleaned up
[1:47:09] sometimes and i do have to correct you
[1:47:11] sometimes
[1:47:13] but
[1:47:14] i like you
[1:47:15] what would you like
[1:47:18] extend that golden scepter
[1:47:20] let's turn to first thessalonians
[1:47:22] chapter five
[1:47:32] because if this is
[1:47:34] that day
[1:47:36] and i believe it is
[1:47:39] okay
[1:47:44] then
[1:47:47] what are you are you a grasshopper are
[1:47:50] you among them that are going to perish
[1:47:53] are you among them that
[1:47:55] the imagination of your heart
[1:47:58] is continually wicked
[1:48:01] or are you among them that
[1:48:03] whose imagination has stayed on thee
[1:48:07] but of the times and the seasons
[1:48:09] brethren you have no need that i write
[1:48:11] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[1:48:14] that the day of the lord so cometh as a
[1:48:16] thief in the night
[1:48:18] for when they shall say peace and safety
[1:48:21] and sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:48:23] as travail upon a woman with child
[1:48:26] they shall not escape but ye brethren
[1:48:29] are not
[1:48:30] in darkness that that day should
[1:48:32] overtake you as a thief
[1:48:35] ye are all children of the light
[1:48:38] and the children of the day we are not
[1:48:39] of the night nor darkness
[1:48:42] therefore let us not sleep as others do
[1:48:45] but let us watch and be sober
[1:48:48] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[1:48:50] and they that be drunken are drunken in
[1:48:52] the night
[1:48:53] but let us
[1:48:54] who are of the day
[1:48:57] be sober
[1:48:58] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[1:49:00] love
[1:49:02] for a helmet the hope of salvation
[1:49:04] for god hath not appointed us to wrath
[1:49:08] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[1:49:10] jesus christ
[1:49:12] who died for us that whether we wake or
[1:49:14] sleep
[1:49:15] we should live together with him
[1:49:18] wherefore comfort yourselves together
[1:49:21] and edify you
[1:49:23] one another even also
[1:49:26] as you do
[1:49:30] i don't think
[1:49:32] it could be said any better
[1:49:37] let's pray
[1:49:38] heavenly father
[1:49:40] thank you for your goodness
[1:49:43] thank you that we can recognize the
[1:49:44] signs of the times
[1:49:46] and we ask you lord that we wouldn't
[1:49:48] enter into the mindset of the world that
[1:49:50] would grieve you and
[1:49:51] take a thing of joy and turn it into a
[1:49:54] thing of mourning for you
[1:49:56] but we pray lord that we could be found
[1:49:58] those
[1:49:59] among those who have your favor who have
[1:50:01] your grace among those who
[1:50:04] extend your scepter to and say
[1:50:06] come partake of the ruling of my kingdom
[1:50:09] with me
[1:50:11] may we be sober
[1:50:13] may we be vigilant yes
[1:50:17] may we edify and encourage one another
[1:50:19] in these dark times
[1:50:22] what if i've said anything that's in
[1:50:24] error
[1:50:25] pray that you'd forgive me and let it
[1:50:26] come to your light
[1:50:28] the lord the words that you will have
[1:50:30] spoken may they sink down in our hearts
[1:50:32] and bring forth
[1:50:34] the fruit that you'd have of them
[1:50:37] even through such ears as ours and such
[1:50:39] lips as mine
[1:50:41] give myself to you in jesus name
[1:50:44] amen
[1:50:50] god bless you god bless you
[1:50:53] [Applause]
[1:50:55] praise the lord
[1:50:58] i just i sent a quote back there let's
[1:51:00] just read there brother branham says
[1:51:02] something
[1:51:04] and uh
[1:51:07] i thought it was beautiful i thought it
[1:51:09] was beautiful
[1:51:11] that's that's a wonderful hesitation
[1:51:14] praise the lord
[1:51:16] you know there's there's there's this
[1:51:17] thing about a about a preacher
[1:51:19] especially when you are in the office of
[1:51:22] a pastor
[1:51:23] whenever you have a visiting minister
[1:51:26] you you
[1:51:28] you uh you look to the holy spirit to
[1:51:30] preach to you to minister to you
[1:51:33] but then also
[1:51:35] you look
[1:51:36] to see if the holy spirit
[1:51:39] will be able to
[1:51:41] confirm that
[1:51:44] you know you are you are in
[1:51:47] you are in the in in in the china you
[1:51:49] are you know you are saying what the
[1:51:51] spirit wants to say to the church
[1:51:53] because you don't even you don't tell
[1:51:54] the preacher what you were preaching
[1:51:56] before you don't have no composition and
[1:51:58] then he comes
[1:51:59] because
[1:52:01] the holy spirit deals with every local
[1:52:03] assembly
[1:52:04] he deals with every local assembly even
[1:52:07] even as a family you know he has a
[1:52:10] dealing with us as a family and that's
[1:52:12] the thing that makes it wonderful
[1:52:14] because i'm not living with you in your
[1:52:16] house and you come to church and the
[1:52:18] holy spirit is able to speak to you
[1:52:20] exactly what you were thinking in your
[1:52:23] in your kitchen or on on your dining
[1:52:25] table or something just come out you
[1:52:27] know that's how beautiful it is so i
[1:52:29] just thought it was beautiful tonight
[1:52:31] but let's look at this brother branham
[1:52:33] years talk in the message
[1:52:35] confirmation and evidence
[1:52:38] he said to think that god
[1:52:41] who made the universe i thought that was
[1:52:43] a very beautiful
[1:52:45] thought about imagination
[1:52:49] the picture gets it gets it gets bigger
[1:52:52] amen
[1:52:54] anyway that brother dairy brought it
[1:52:55] tonight that was that was beautiful to
[1:52:58] think that the god who made the universe
[1:53:01] the god who made the solar system
[1:53:04] who made the heaven and the earth and
[1:53:07] created them
[1:53:09] by
[1:53:10] his spoken word
[1:53:13] remember
[1:53:14] a word is a taught express
[1:53:19] god taught it
[1:53:23] then when he expressed it
[1:53:26] it has to happen
[1:53:30] for the word
[1:53:32] was freemen
[1:53:36] praise the lord
[1:53:37] so it means that
[1:53:39] god had an imagination
[1:53:43] god came into a mindset
[1:53:46] of what he wanted to do
[1:53:53] praise the lord
[1:53:55] that's that's the same word
[1:53:57] and brother branham says it over and
[1:54:00] over and over every time when he talks
[1:54:03] about
[1:54:05] a word is a taught express
[1:54:11] god
[1:54:12] is not speaking over his thought
[1:54:16] he's speaking what he has thought
[1:54:20] of god came into a frame of mind
[1:54:25] concerning you
[1:54:26] and what brother branham would say he
[1:54:28] would say
[1:54:29] and that's the picture he took of you
[1:54:35] he came into a frame of mind
[1:54:40] he was caught in the thought
[1:54:44] when he thought about you being his
[1:54:46] bride
[1:54:50] praise the lord
[1:54:57] even when you think about the word just
[1:54:59] like just like what the scripture says
[1:55:01] he's quoting uh the apostle paul year
[1:55:04] and when he expressed it like brother
[1:55:06] branham says when god
[1:55:09] expressed his thought it has to happen
[1:55:14] because he have already created a
[1:55:16] picture that's what the imagination does
[1:55:21] he have already created a picture in his
[1:55:24] mind how that word is going to come to
[1:55:27] pass
[1:55:34] it has to happen
[1:55:35] for the world was framed by the word of
[1:55:37] god the things which
[1:55:40] that the things
[1:55:42] were made out of things that do not
[1:55:46] appear
[1:55:47] it was god's word his thought he taught
[1:55:51] it
[1:55:54] and he spoke it
[1:55:56] and it has to come to pass
[1:56:02] it's a sea that is growing
[1:56:07] and marvelously
[1:56:09] that has to bring forth in his season
[1:56:13] that's the reason why the prophet isaiah
[1:56:15] says
[1:56:16] when god words go out
[1:56:19] it don't return back
[1:56:23] because god
[1:56:25] has thought about it he has a frame of
[1:56:28] mind
[1:56:30] he gave us the promise brother i'm
[1:56:32] saying right here is in the seafoam
[1:56:34] growing he gave us the promise
[1:56:37] now we try to create in our mind we try
[1:56:41] to create our imagination of how god
[1:56:44] will bring his word to pass
[1:56:48] we see the promise
[1:56:50] but we do not catch the frame of mind
[1:56:54] that gods have until the world comes to
[1:56:56] pass
[1:57:01] you only have the promise
[1:57:04] you shall be changed you you will be
[1:57:06] adopted you will be raptured we have
[1:57:08] that promise but before god made the
[1:57:11] promise
[1:57:13] he have come into a frame of mind
[1:57:18] how are we going to get out of here
[1:57:21] praise the lord
[1:57:23] and you see sometimes in god's frame of
[1:57:26] mind
[1:57:28] he thought of bringing us to our best
[1:57:31] state
[1:57:32] through trials
[1:57:37] in his frame of mind i can get these
[1:57:39] people to be what i want them to be
[1:57:44] when i bring them through this
[1:57:51] but most of the time we are trying to
[1:57:53] approach the promises of god on our
[1:57:56] frame of mind
[1:58:03] we put our knees before god lord this is
[1:58:05] my need i need you to move in this area
[1:58:08] then we create a frame of mind when you
[1:58:10] are moving move like this
[1:58:13] move like this
[1:58:16] and move in two weeks
[1:58:20] before the end of the month you have to
[1:58:22] move
[1:58:23] then we stay in that frame of mind and
[1:58:26] as long as we stay in our frame of mind
[1:58:28] it's difficult to get over to god's
[1:58:31] frame of mind
[1:58:41] praise the lord
[1:58:44] that's the reason why brother branham
[1:58:46] taught us to look at the bigger picture
[1:58:50] to everything
[1:58:51] there is a bigger picture
[1:58:55] because god's frame of mind
[1:58:58] is in the bigger picture
[1:59:05] when he was thinking of bringing you to
[1:59:07] grace there are a lot of things that he
[1:59:09] taught about
[1:59:12] there are a lot of things he taught
[1:59:14] about
[1:59:22] praise lord
[1:59:29] i just think that that was beautiful
[1:59:30] tonight brother branham says we can take
[1:59:33] his word
[1:59:35] and see that he promised
[1:59:37] in the last day
[1:59:40] that he did draw his people out
[1:59:43] and do the very same thing he did
[1:59:48] like he did in the days of sodom
[1:59:54] and with everything that is happening
[1:59:55] around the world
[1:59:57] can you imagine
[1:59:58] that they were all in the free mind of
[2:00:01] god
[2:00:02] that's why nothing takes him by surprise
[2:00:06] he's not anxious
[2:00:10] because they were all in the frame mama
[2:00:13] the free mind of god
[2:00:19] that's why we have to trust him
[2:00:23] amen
[2:00:24] we have to trust him in and every every
[2:00:27] giving day
[2:00:30] is an opportunity
[2:00:32] to trust god
[2:00:36] every giving day
[2:00:38] we have to be growing in trust
[2:00:44] we have to be growing in trust
[2:00:47] we have to be letting go of
[2:00:50] of
[2:00:51] how we think things can be done
[2:00:53] and how we want it to be done
[2:00:56] and we have to be trusting in the lord
[2:01:04] musicians you can come
[2:01:07] praise the lord bless you brother derek
[2:01:10] that was beautiful tonight amen
[2:01:13] praise the lord
[2:01:20] there is a preacher to have men in
[2:01:21] pictures
[2:01:24] he preached with a lot of pictures
[2:01:33] let's buy our house together tonight
[2:01:47] be it unto me not calling to your word
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:02:12] that's the reason why we have to embrace
[2:02:15] we have to embrace the promises of god
[2:02:18] let's not reason the word reason reason
[2:02:21] on the word let's let's embrace the
