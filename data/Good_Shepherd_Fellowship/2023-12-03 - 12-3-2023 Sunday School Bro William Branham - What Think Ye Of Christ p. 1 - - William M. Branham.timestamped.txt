[12:13] [Music]
[14:11] [Music]
[14:57] for
[15:04] [Music]
[15:31] bless you I got into something didn't
[15:34] I uh I want to thank the
[15:39] Lord real well for undertaking for
[15:42] brother caps' boy that U just so
[15:46] happened and this is a little time that
[15:48] I come back to Indiana I know you're not
[15:51] recording this I suppose not and so then
[15:54] don't see nobody in there so then I come
[15:57] back go squirrel hunt and so U I guess
[16:00] Charlie's going to have to put up with
[16:02] me him and Nelly and I'm down in
[16:03] Kentucky now for a day or two to
[16:05] squirrel hunt so uh I'd rather miss
[16:09] anything any other kind of recreation
[16:11] than come here on about the middle of
[16:14] August and go squirrel hunting with
[16:15] Charlie and Banks and all of them it's
[16:18] kind of a traditional thing with me and
[16:21] so um I took Joel when we was here the
[16:24] other time everybody got sick it Chang
[16:27] from that real hot cloud clim down to
[16:29] this to this cool climate you got here I
[16:32] know you think this is not cool but you
[16:35] come out to Arizona once it's 109 the
[16:38] shade when I left the other morning and
[16:40] then around midnight in the night when
[16:43] the cool air come down off the mountain
[16:44] is still
[16:45] 96 see that's at midnight when the cool
[16:48] air was coming down and so it's that
[16:51] place is all right in the winter time
[16:53] but it's for scorpions and lizards in
[16:55] the summertime not human beings even
[16:58] though all the animals take off for the
[16:59] mountains they just can't stand it and
[17:03] I'd been out to shootting my little
[17:04] rifle in uh somehow I just want to tell
[17:07] you about the little caps boy and I said
[17:10] and Joel I just have to give him the
[17:13] rifle cuz he can out shoot me we got it
[17:16] shot in and I I driveing tax 50 yards
[17:21] and I said to to Joel Joel said Daddy I
[17:24] believe I can do that poor little fell
[17:25] that had a headache I've been praying
[17:27] for him a high fever he went out the
[17:29] range with me uh any uh 2 over 10 boore
[17:34] and a 22 rif FP crosses its line of fire
[17:37] at 25 yards is in again at 50 just the
[17:39] same if it's 2 over 10 so then um and I
[17:43] shot it in 25 yards and so I had two
[17:46] more taxs and I and if Joe didn't drive
[17:49] both them taxs I didn't have any more
[17:52] tax so I put a little bit of piece of an
[17:53] old clay pigeon have been bursted there
[17:56] what Trap Shooters shoot at just about
[17:58] about a qu of an inch across and tuck it
[18:00] out on 50 yards and he cut it half and
[18:02] two and the scope was set for my eyes
[18:06] just a few years older than he was so he
[18:08] said you know what I've got to go by and
[18:10] tell Billy to keep off of my feet from
[18:12] now
[18:13] on so I said well I tell you what said
[18:17] let's go down show brother Norman that I
[18:20] said Joel and matches across the world I
[18:23] don't care who it would be nobody now
[18:26] the tax wasn't drove sideways they were
[18:27] drove straight through and that piece
[18:30] not
[18:30] over uh I guess a qu of an inch and a 16
[18:35] thick and a qu of an inch high he cut it
[18:38] half and two at 50 yards I said there's
[18:42] no one in the world could have made a
[18:44] better shot they a Champions could have
[18:46] done the same thing but you couldn't
[18:48] have made three better shots than them
[18:50] the T's not B just a straight hold
[18:52] through the paper where the attack went
[18:54] through and it's just simply spread out
[18:56] you can buy anything out cheat lie steal
[19:00] everything else as I said a few Sundays
[19:02] ago and look where you're
[19:03] at nothing but just a crooked massive
[19:07] everything but a righteous King can make
[19:10] his own
[19:11] laws and you can kill a man you're no
[19:14] good politics that's all right you get
[19:16] out of it see and so it's it it the
[19:20] democracy is a good idea but it won't
[19:24] work you're like
[19:26] communism all things in
[19:29] it sounds good but it won't work now the
[19:32] God's way of having a king like David
[19:34] was was right and you got one mind
[19:37] centered over like one leader and a
[19:39] bunch of geese or so forth you can't
[19:41] take two or three of them then you mess
[19:42] them all together you come up with any
[19:44] kind of an idea
[19:46] so we find the conditions
[19:50] today ready for the coming of the Lord
[19:55] but while brother Neville and I and
[19:58] these other brothers are trying to
[19:59] Shepherd A
[20:01] Flock I've got something on my mind now
[20:04] that comes that we might talk
[20:06] about that
[20:08] is I got a letter the other day from a
[20:11] fine
[20:13] lady I never got it come through another
[20:16] person and she was
[20:18] certainly tearing me to pieces or trying
[20:21] to was saying did you ever can't you
[20:25] Christian businessman do something to
[20:27] stop brother
[20:29] said because that he's got this book out
[20:31] now called the lady of C Church age
[20:34] bringing out
[20:36] more and said he's just simply
[20:39] tearing Pentecostal Doctrine to Pieces
[20:43] said now he's talk about the initial
[20:44] evidence ain't speaking in tongues and
[20:47] said then he's against women preachers
[20:49] and this was a woman preacher and her
[20:51] boys some of the best friends that I got
[20:54] in the world she they're among the best
[20:56] friends that I got
[20:59] and she said now and this man and wife I
[21:02] was eating breakfast with him they said
[21:03] brother Braham look at this would you
[21:04] think it and pulled out a letter I said
[21:07] well sister she just don't understand
[21:11] the boys told me their mother was a
[21:13] woman preacher and and she didn't go for
[21:16] the message and now she says in here she
[21:20] said now he said women should not have
[21:23] authority over man said how about BBE in
[21:27] the Bible
[21:30] Bible Paul's
[21:32] helper
[21:34] certainly she was a seller of
[21:37] goods and uh Paul asked the people you
[21:41] think Paul would say let the women keep
[21:42] silent in the churches not permitted
[21:44] them to speak and turn around and say
[21:46] now feebe my helper in the gospel he
[21:48] should go to preach a few nights well
[21:50] he' contradict his own
[21:53] word and said then the top of all I
[21:57] believe it was Esther was one of the
[21:58] judges in the Bible said a woman was a
[22:02] judge in the Bible if that's not
[22:04] authority over man and this businessman
[22:08] that was healed right here in the church
[22:09] not long ago he said now his wife said
[22:12] brother BR that always puzzle me I said
[22:15] well sister how would that puzzle
[22:17] you said well here is the woman judge I
[22:22] said that's politics not the church amen
[22:25] I don't have nothing to do with the
[22:26] church Paul let it be under obedience as
[22:29] also saith the law right and the law
[22:32] can't put a woman up to be a priest
[22:35] can't put it up you never seen a woman
[22:37] high priest never seen a woman a priest
[22:40] nowhere in the Bible you never seen a
[22:42] woman a preacher in the Bible amen
[22:44] certainly some of them was propheus and
[22:46] so forth maram and different ones and
[22:49] Esther or one of them was a judge over
[22:52] Israel sometimes they were Queens over
[22:54] them and so forth like that king and
[22:56] queen the decease of the king the queen
[22:58] had to take his place to the elect of
[22:59] another king and so forth and Tu in
[23:02] Tucson Arizona we got a woman judge
[23:05] there in the city that's the reason the
[23:07] city is so polluted and we got a woman
[23:10] ain't got no business in politics she
[23:12] got no business in the O over any
[23:15] Authority in the
[23:17] church her place is a man's Queen at
[23:21] home outside of that she has nothing and
[23:25] we know that to be the truth you'll
[23:28] never find it I know that sounds
[23:30] oldfashioned but I'm responsible and I
[23:33] know that after my going away from this
[23:35] Earth that tapes and that books will be
[23:37] living on and many of you young children
[23:39] are find in the days to come and this is
[23:42] exactly the truth because I speak it in
[23:46] the name of the
[23:47] Lord now we wonder how a
[23:50] woman that's a good woman and she is
[23:53] brought on this Earth by her loyal
[23:57] husband
[23:58] a good
[23:59] man some of the finest boys that I ever
[24:02] met their
[24:03] man that I've ever met and just quickly
[24:07] just as soon as they heard the message
[24:10] they were sold on it
[24:13] 100% now that can only come by for
[24:16] ordination the only way it can
[24:19] come now the question is here I thinking
[24:23] that see not why the Lord was bring me
[24:24] back and know it knowest know it not art
[24:28] naked miserable wretched blind and know
[24:31] it not before I get to that spot I might
[24:34] brief what I said a few days ago he in a
[24:37] message on I believe it was the uh God
[24:41] of this world blinded the eyes of the
[24:44] people that they
[24:47] absolutely worshiped the
[24:50] devil and religious
[24:52] Services did you all get that all of you
[24:54] understood it and then in that same
[24:57] message I brought the subject that a
[25:00] woman
[25:01] wearing immoral clothes
[25:05] indecently she is be judged at the
[25:09] Judgment bar as a street prostitute that
[25:13] sounds awful strange let me draw you a
[25:15] little
[25:17] picture now here is an attorney in the
[25:20] city of
[25:22] young and he's a nice man as far as as a
[25:27] politically I imagine he may be decent
[25:29] in his
[25:30] politics and then um he goes with a girl
[25:33] that's very popular they fall in love
[25:36] and marry they attend to all the parties
[25:39] and the great uh things and they all
[25:42] drink together finally she uh he has a
[25:45] nice home he lives in a nice
[25:48] neighborhood he's well thought of
[25:50] amongst the people but he both of them
[25:54] drink she wears shorts cuts her ha wears
[25:58] makeup everything just as sex beautiful
[26:02] woman displaying herself well she never
[26:06] goes to church at all neither one of
[26:07] them so moving next door to him comes a
[26:12] woman from the Baptist Church or the
[26:15] Methodist Church her and her
[26:18] husband now this woman uh let's make it
[26:21] methodists because the methodists go a
[26:23] little more on Holiness than the Baptist
[26:25] all except the New Testament Baptist
[26:27] they believe in Holiness but usually
[26:29] Baptists don't go for Holiness at all
[26:31] see they don't believe in such a thing
[26:33] so
[26:34] then now let's make it Methodist cause
[26:36] to believe in
[26:37] Holiness and uh then a Methodist woman
[26:41] moves next door to this woman on the
[26:44] same street her husband is um let's say
[26:48] he's a public accountant and uh or some
[26:52] office
[26:53] well this Methodist woman looks over to
[26:57] The Other Woman woman and when this
[26:58] lawyer goes out of town say his name is
[27:02] John say his name is John now don't
[27:05] presume on that now I'm miss taking
[27:07] fiction names now and his name is
[27:10] John well she used to go with
[27:13] Ralph and that's fix name all of it so
[27:16] you just so you get the story to make
[27:18] the
[27:19] picture well first thing you know at a
[27:22] drunken party Ral hugs her again well
[27:25] she gets all fired up because she's in
[27:28] love again with Ralph she thinks then
[27:30] after a while Ralph begins to meet her
[27:34] and she can put it over John pull it
[27:36] over his eyes and she thinks she's
[27:38] pretty smart duck because she can run
[27:41] with ralth married to John see the woman
[27:44] don't even have the very bearing of
[27:49] decency and she thinks nothing about
[27:52] that but this Methodist woman has raised
[27:55] up in another bracket she does at least
[27:58] go to
[27:59] church and she thinks that that woman is
[28:03] horrible while she says to her husband
[28:05] when he comes in I see that man go in
[28:07] there and meet her and when John's out
[28:10] on a Case somewhere Philadelphia
[28:12] somewhere he takes her out in this
[28:15] Roadster and they lay out on the beach I
[28:19] see him come home don't even pull the
[28:20] curtains down sometime kissing her and
[28:22] making love to her next oh isn't that
[28:24] awful she says to her husband well she's
[28:27] nothing but a public prostitute it's
[28:30] true she's worse than a public
[28:32] prostitute because she's a married woman
[28:35] and she uh This Woman This Methodist
[28:38] woman thinks that's horrible she never
[28:39] goes to church now this Methodist woman
[28:42] would not do
