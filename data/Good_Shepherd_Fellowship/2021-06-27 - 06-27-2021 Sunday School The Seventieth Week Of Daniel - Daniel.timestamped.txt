[7:20] israel in our homeland we know that
[7:23] are we in the ladies sin age has the
[7:26] message of this pentecostal age went
[7:27] forth to try to shake the people back to
[7:29] the original pentecostal blessing
[7:31] amen has every messenger come to the age
[7:33] just exactly the same thing
[7:34] amen is the nations against nations
[7:38] amen pestilence
[7:41] is there a famine in the land today the
[7:43] true church driving hundreds of miles
[7:45] seeking to hear the word of god
[7:47] not for bread alone but for hearing of
[7:49] the word of god there come a famine
[7:51] is that right well we're living right in
[7:53] the middle of it right here now
[7:57] see where we're at we're waiting for
[7:59] that stone
[8:02] a striking statement from the time
[8:05] god made the promise to abraham
[8:08] don't miss this from the time god made
[8:11] the promise to abraham
[8:13] genesis 12 3 to the time of
[8:17] christ being rejected in 1833
[8:21] by the jews according to galatians 3
[8:25] 16 and 17 and according to
[8:29] usher's ushers ursus chronology
[8:33] of the hebrews the power of god was with
[8:37] the jews exactly
[8:40] 1954 years
[8:43] god dealt with the jews 1954 years
[8:48] according to the chronology of the jews
[8:51] and according to galatians 3 16 and 17.
[8:53] it got many more scriptures but just did
[8:55] that
[8:57] then after they rejected christ he
[9:00] turned to the gentiles
[9:02] to take a people for his name
[9:05] you want a scripture on that the place
[9:07] acts
[9:08] 15 14.
[9:12] now counting the time
[9:15] we find that we have exactly
[9:19] listen 17 years left
[9:23] and we will have the same span of time
[9:27] given to us
[9:28] as god dealing with us in the power of
[9:30] the holy spirit since
[9:31] 80 33 until 1977 the same
[9:36] span of time of 1954 years god
[9:40] deals with us the same as he did with
[9:41] the jews amen
[9:43] amen how about that
[9:46] hallelujah now mark down in your book
[9:51] a little scripture here i want to give
[9:52] you leviticus 25
[9:54] beginning with the eighth verse god
[9:57] called the jubilee
[9:58] every 49th year the 50th year was a
[10:02] jubilee we know that
[10:05] we understand that from the first
[10:07] jubilee
[10:08] of leviticus 25 8
[10:12] and 1977
[10:15] will be the 70th jubilee making exactly
[10:18] three thousand
[10:19] four hundred and thirty years amen

[10:39] day of sweet release
[10:40] when our savior shall come back to earth
[10:42] again
[10:44] did you get that yes god has dealt with
[10:48] us
[10:48] exactly the same amount of time that he
[10:51] dealt with the jews in the time he gave
[10:52] abraham the promise until the rejecting
[10:55] of the messiah in 80 33
[10:58] was 1954 years and now
[11:02] we have 17 years left
[11:05] we had about 1930-something years

[11:16] 70th jubilee since the beginning of
[11:19] jubilees

[11:26] the jubilee
[11:27] of the going up for the gentile bride
[11:31] and the return of christ to the jews
[11:33] when they go out of bondage
[11:35] amen don't you see from all the world

[16:02] fifth thing

[16:07] until they will make
[16:08] a car that will not have to be guided by
[16:11] a steering wheel
[16:12] and the cars will continue to be shaped
[16:14] like an egg
[16:16] until the consummation the end time
[16:20] i seen an american family going down the
[16:22] road
[16:23] in a broad way riding in a car with
[16:26] their
[16:27] backs turned towards where the wheel

[17:08] and this car coming on the on the scene
[17:10] bringing five things out of the seven
[17:12] that has happened exactly now
[17:16] i predicted and said i saw a great woman

[17:19] beautiful looking dressed in real highly
[17:22] royal black purple
[17:24] and i got little princess down here she
[17:26] was a great ruler in the united states

[17:56] the divorce courts of america produce
[17:58] more divorces by our women and
[18:01] all the rest of the nation
[18:05] the morals in our country is lower
[18:08] and divorces than it is in france or
[18:11] italy
[18:11] where prostitution's on the street so
[18:14] but they're prostitutes
[18:16] ours is married women trying to live
[18:18] with several men and several married men
[18:20] trying to live with other women
[18:22] and the nations where they have plagued
[18:23] me it's a thousand times better
[18:26] and yet polygamy is wrong we know but it
[18:28] shows how degraded we are
[18:30] i got a piece up out of the paper words
[18:32] showed that when our american boys went
[18:33] overseas in this last war
[18:35] that over obviously around 70 well wait
[18:38] a minute i believe it was three out of
[18:40] four
[18:41] that went overseas was divorced by their
[18:43] wife before they got back it's great
[18:44] big headline says what's happened to the
[18:46] morals of our american people you've

[18:58] it's a woman's nation what's she gonna
[19:00] have a woman god
[19:02] or a goddess
[19:06] now then after that i turned and looked
[19:09] and i saw this united states burning
[19:12] like a smolder
[19:14] rocks had been blowed up and it was
[19:16] burning like a
[19:18] heap of fire and logs or something that
[19:20] just set it apart
[19:21] and looked as far as i could see and she
[19:23] had been blowing up
[19:25] and then the vision left me
[19:29] five out of the three has happened
[19:32] a five out of the seven rather it's
[19:34] happened and the air comes around and
[19:35] shows
[19:36] and then i predicted i never said the
[19:38] lord told me that but standing that
[19:39] morning in the church
[19:40] i said the way progress i got back to
[19:43] one of their wall and run to the other
[19:44] in the wall
[19:44] and i said the way progress is going on
[19:47] i'll predict at the time i don't know
[19:49] why i'm saying it
[19:50] but i predicted that'll all happen
[19:52] between right now 19 and 33 and 19 and
[19:55] 77
[19:56] and not knowing it god knows my heart i
[19:59] never know it until yesterday

[20:03] exactly the same amount of time run out
[20:05] that you give with israel and everything
[20:06] at the end
[20:08] so we're at and here we are at the end
[20:10] of the age at the coming into the
[20:12] seventies week

[20:23] understand daniel 7 is weak now
[20:26] see now when we go on into these seals
[20:27] and things breaking these seals

[20:31] rider he's got a bull in his hand watch
[20:34] who that guy is
[20:35] watch that pale horse ride after him see
[20:37] watch who it is and
[20:38] look how they come in watch those
[20:40] hundred and forty four thousand come and
[20:41] watch that sleeping virgin when she
[20:43] comes up
[20:44] then watch all these things take place
[20:46] of pouring out of the bowels the wolves
[20:47] the three unclean spirits like frogs
[20:49] watch those things how they fit right in
[20:51] those flags and exactly when they're
[20:52] poured out
[20:53] every time a seal open a plague pours
[20:56] out
[20:56] and a destruction comes watch what takes
[21:00] place right now
[21:00] at the end and oh watch these three
[21:03] prophets are these two prophets when the
[21:04] ray raised up here
[21:05] in the middle of the week they're cut
[21:07] off like that and then starts the battle
[21:09] of armageddon then god began to speak
[21:10] himself
[21:11] then he stands and begins to fight that
[21:14] prophets are
[21:15] striking the earth they're preaching the
[21:17] name of jesus christ they're baptized in
[21:19] the same way
[21:20] they're doing the same thing as the
[21:21] first pentecostal fathers did
[21:23] and many are following them but that who
[21:25] confederated that
[21:26] organization moved right on down
[21:29] and even the power of those prophets
[21:31] didn't break it
[21:32] and finally they said we'll make it all
[21:34] one organization and he brings in what
[21:36] is it the abomination
[21:38] romanism to overspread the whole thing
[21:42] that makes desolation the abomination
[21:45] that maketh desolation takes it
[21:47] everything
[21:48] the filthiness remember the old mother
[21:50] prostitute
[21:51] that set up on a beast scarred a clove
[21:53] like that had seven heads and ten horns

[21:56] she had a cup in her hand of the
[21:57] filthiness of her abomination

[22:55] that's what the system of it that's it
[22:59] i wasn't against germany it was a nazism
[23:02] i was against the italians
[23:03] it was against the fascism and remember
[23:06] i made another prediction in that time
[23:09] just a prediction
[23:10] and many of you old timers remember i
[23:12] said these three great isms trying to
[23:13] take a hold in a world of date
[23:14] fascism nazism and communism
[23:18] and what i say they would all wind up
[23:21] in communism and i just had you all
[23:23] repeat it over
[23:24] keep your eyes on russia remember that
[23:28] keep your eyes on russia she'll all wind
[23:32] up in communism
[23:33] and then it'll all wind up finally in
[23:36] catholicism
[23:40] remember it'll all wind up in
[23:42] catholicism
[23:44] in the end time that's exactly right
[23:46] that's at the battle of armageddon
[23:48] right over in here when christ comes
[23:50] himself
[23:51] but these three prophets these three and
[23:53] a half years rather that's revelations

[23:57] power into my two witnesses and they'll
[23:58] prophesy a thousand two hundred and
[23:59] three score days
[24:00] how many is it 1203 score days three and
[24:03] a half years
[24:05] and then they should be killed in the
[24:06] streets right in the midst of this 70th
