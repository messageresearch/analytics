[41:30] [Music]
[41:32] sinking
[41:34] of
[41:39] you.
[41:41] Sing
[41:44] out
[41:46] of you, Lord.
[41:50] [Music]
[41:52] Oh,

[42:04] Lord.
[42:06] I
[42:09] love
[42:19] you. God bless you. could be in the
[42:22] house of the Lord. We want to thank the
[42:24] Lord for giving us u another opportunity
[42:27] to be in this house this morning. And
[42:30] again, we want to say happy mother's day
[42:33] to each and every one of you. What a way
[42:37] to remember our mothers.
[42:40] Amen. And uh we just
[42:45] uh want to be so so so grateful. So
[42:49] grateful. Amen.
[42:52] So
[42:52] grateful
[42:54] for that
[42:56] uh special one in our life called a
[43:00] mother. Praise the
[43:02] Lord. Amen.
[43:09] Amen. So this morning we want to
[43:16] uh let's let's try that song.
[43:20] that I say to you.
[43:30] Um, he didn't throw the vessel away.
[43:33] Didn't throw the clay away.
[43:40] [Music]
[43:58] I send you all uh I send out uh a
[44:02] mother's greetings this
[44:05] morning. And if some didn't get it, I'd
[44:09] like to read this uh while the
[44:16] If the technicians can help us find that
[44:19] song. He didn't throw the clay
[44:28] away. Mother is so great. You
[44:31] know the first one that receive you in
[44:34] this life is your mother.
[44:39] No one can touch
[44:40] you
[44:42] because you are
[44:45] conceived and she b you on her
[44:48] heart and she is the first to know
[44:53] you and the first in this life to hold
[44:59] you. Then when you are
[45:02] born, she is one of the first hand that
[45:06] touch
[45:07] you and uh and wipe back the tears out
[45:12] of your eyes. She is the first one to
[45:16] patch you and to love you and to hold
[45:20] over you in this
[45:23] life is your mother.
[45:26] Now I think that there is not enough
[45:30] honor that we could give to a mother.
[45:36] Mother is the first with the child and
[45:40] she is a great responsibility of what
[45:44] that child will
[45:46] be will base upon the way that mother
[45:50] starts that child on the path of the
[45:54] path that it must
[45:55] travel. Mother has a
[45:58] responsibility from God to place that
[46:01] child on the right path.
[46:05] And I think that's why mother has a
[46:10] special little
[46:11] touch.
[46:13] Amen. Again we say happy Mother's
[46:19] Day.
[46:22] Empty and
[46:25] broken. I came back to
[46:31] here and their
[46:34] soul on
[46:37] the souls died from
[46:43] sin. He did
[46:45] it in that
[46:47] despair. He started
[46:51] over again.
[46:55] And I'm
[46:57] blessed of
[46:58] it. He didn't
[47:01] throw the plan
[47:06] [Music]
[47:07] away. And
[47:10] over and
[47:13] over he pulls
[47:16] me and make
[47:19] me
[47:21] into his likeness.
[47:24] He
[47:26] fight this
[47:28] way. Oh, a
[47:31] vessel of
[47:34] honor I am
[47:39] today. All because
[47:44] Jesus made it
[47:46] through the clear away. Let's sing that
[47:49] chorus again.
[47:51] Over and
[47:54] over he moves me and makes
[47:59] me
[48:01] into his
[48:04] image. He
[48:06] fashion this place. Yes. the
[48:11] vessel of
[48:14] father I am
[48:18] today and it's all because
[48:23] Jesus did he drove the clay
[48:27] away. Let's sing in that verse
[48:31] now. He
[48:33] is the potter.
[48:37] I am the
[48:41] grave. Oh, then in his
[48:45] image he wants me to
[48:50] stay when I
[48:52] stumble and
[48:54] fall and
[48:56] my so
[48:59] great. He just pick
[49:01] up the pieces. He did. He drove the clay
[49:09] away.
[49:11] Over and
[49:14] over me and makes
[49:18] me
[49:20] into his
[49:22] image. He
[49:25] fashion the clay.
[49:27] Oh, a
[49:29] vessel, a
[49:32] father I am to
[49:36] thee is all because
[49:41] Jesus made it through this great
[49:49] way. The Lord bless you. You can have
[49:51] your
[49:53] seat. Praise the Lord.
[49:57] Amen.
[49:59] Amen. Amen. Before we go into the
[50:02] service, we will like to
[50:06] read a letter here to you
[50:10] uh some part of
[50:14] u sometime last year. We we had a little
[50:19] uh meeting after
[50:21] church because of a situation we were
[50:25] dealing with.
[50:26] and uh
[50:28] uh and we had to break up that situation
[50:32] before the church.
[50:36] and uh uh which of course we told you at
[50:40] the time that uh we will encourage you
[50:45] to pray for brother Steven
[50:47] Woods and uh
[50:50] uh uh the Lord have been
[50:55] gracious over
[50:57] the couple of months
[50:59] and proceeded after
[51:02] that and uh I think of your prayers.
[51:08] Uh we were able to get the attention of
[51:11] our
[51:12] brother and then
[51:14] uh uh we thought that we needed a little
[51:18] time to to work with
[51:21] him and his
[51:23] family and uh uh he wrote uh a letter of
[51:28] of apology to the
[51:30] church and but I thought that we needed
[51:33] to to get uh ourself to a better
[51:38] with the situation and also with his
[51:41] family. So, and I think uh he and his
[51:44] wife will have love for us to read this
[51:47] letter today. So, we want to want to
[51:50] read it to the church. Dear saints, I
[51:53] write to express my sincere apology and
[51:57] I ask for your forgiveness of my
[52:00] action and the unacceptable conduct that
[52:04] I've been involved in. My action and my
[52:07] conduct are completely unacceptable and
[52:12] unscriptural. I have I have
[52:14] hereby repented my sinful
[52:18] conduct and misbehavior and wish to
[52:22] return to full fellowship. I understand
[52:25] that my action and conduct have caused
[52:28] much more pain to my family, the church
[52:32] and all that
[52:34] uh I love
[52:37] uh in in diverse ways as this was
[52:41] inappropriate and affected both the
[52:43] church and all those involved including
[52:46] myself as well. I also realize that that
[52:50] the best and scriptural thing to do is
[52:54] to fully repent and seek God's
[52:57] forgiveness. I am committed to making
[53:01] amends to such behavior and hope this
[53:04] won't happen again.
[53:07] I thank you all for your relentless
[53:09] prayer. Please accept my sincere
[53:13] apology and continue to pray for me and
[53:17] my family. Thank Thank you for your
[53:21] understanding. God bless you, your
[53:24] brother, brother Stevie Wolves. Praise
[53:27] the Lord.
[53:29] [Applause]
[53:36] Let's bow our heads.
[53:41] And
[53:45] uh brother
[53:48] Dan and brother Dan can come
[53:56] in if you just want to move somewhere
[53:59] back there and just lay your hands on
[54:01] brother Steven while we pray.
[54:23] As we bow our heads together this
[54:27] morning and
[54:31] uh to commit our brother in the hands of
[54:34] the Lord.
[54:36] We have to realize that
[54:46] uh that this concern every one of us and
[54:50] involve every one of us.
[54:52] I don't believe uh that it's a healthy
[54:56] thing for us to go away from
[55:00] church, live any kind of a
[55:03] life, come back to
[55:05] church and just think that it's
[55:08] [Music]
[55:10] okay. The people who love to see you.
[55:15] We'll do our best. But the individual
[55:19] has to
[55:23] realize that it's it's wrong. It's not
[55:27] acceptable. We're living in a society
[55:29] where people love to be
[55:32] celebrated. We stayed away from church.
[55:35] We get ourself involved in all sorts of
[55:37] things. And then when we come back to
[55:39] church, we must be celebrated. We must
[55:42] be praised. I don't think it's
[55:44] scriptural.
[55:47] The church has used that to look for
[55:50] members and gain members. But I believe
[55:53] that when we step across scriptural
[55:59] line, think about the prodical
[56:03] son. It was the father that celebrated
[56:06] the prodical
[56:07] son. But the prodical son said in his
[56:10] heart, "I rather go back to my father
[56:13] house. I would rather be a servant than
[56:17] to be a son because I brought this grace
[56:20] to
[56:21] him. He was not going back expecting to
[56:25] be
[56:26] celebrated. He was going back to say,
[56:29] "Father, I'm sorry for all that I've
[56:33] done." And that is to every one of us
[56:36] this morning.
[56:44] I pray that the Holy Spirit will bring
[56:47] conviction to our
[56:54] hearts to realize
[57:00] there when we do things contrary to the
[57:04] word, we might be selfish about it.
[57:14] [Music]
[57:15] I
[57:17] remember where the prophet God says,
[57:19] "Our
[57:21] misbehavior of unconfessed sin can cause
[57:24] this church to
[57:26] fail." And that is with every one of us.
[57:30] [Music]
[57:33] And we ask that we pray together this
[57:36] morning and ask that the Lord be
[57:39] merciful. We pray together this morning
[57:41] and ask that the Lord will bless our
[57:44] brother and his family, his wife and his
[57:47] children. We pray together this morning
[57:50] and that the Lord will help this church
[57:53] and uh help each and every one of us as
[57:57] we pray together in Jesus name. Heavenly
[58:00] Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:03] Christ, oh God, I pray, precious Lord,
[58:06] this morning, Father, as we bring
[58:08] ourself to you, Lord, we ask, oh God,

[58:15] your love and your mercy, oh God,
[58:18] Father. Oh God, we just want to thank

[58:24] say father God and you Lord Jesus oh God

[59:34] Lord, what a responsibility. Oh God,
[59:37] Father, what a responsibility. Oh God,
[59:41] precious Lord Father, I pray it in the
[59:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and say,
[59:47] "Holy Spirit, oh God, Father, that you,
[59:50] oh God, precious Lord, oh God, Father,
[59:54] comes, Lord, help us as an example,
[59:57] Lord, help us, oh God, Father, Lord,

[1:00:03] help, oh Father God, I pray, almighty
[1:00:06] God, Lord, that Lord Jesus Christ, you
[1:00:10] Redeem us, oh God. Father, in your love,
[1:00:13] redeem us, oh God. Father, in your
[1:00:15] mercy, I pray this morning in the name
[1:00:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh God, I ask
[1:00:22] heavenly father, oh God, that your
[1:00:25] grace, oh Lord Jesus, oh father, oh God,
[1:00:28] you know, father, we pray, oh God, Lord,
[1:00:31] be merciful Jesus. Oh father. Oh God

[1:02:20] song. Oh
[1:02:24] Jesus. Oh

[1:02:31] Yes.
[1:02:35] [Music]

[1:02:41] [Music]
[1:02:46] Sweetest
[1:02:49] on our
[1:02:52] thought
[1:02:55] sweetest
[1:02:57] care

[1:03:01] song.
[1:03:03] Oh
[1:03:05] Jesus,
[1:03:08] Jesus. Blessed Jesus.
[1:03:16] Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord
[1:03:18] Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ, we want to bring ourself Lord
[1:03:23] Father to the foot of the cross this
[1:03:25] morning. Oh God, Father, we all repent
[1:03:28] of our wrongs. We ask that Lord you will
[1:03:31] help us, oh God. And Lord Father, we
[1:03:34] want to place Lord
[1:03:36] Jesus our sin and the sin of the people
[1:03:39] under the blood of Jesus Christ and pray
[1:03:42] that God father as the world will be
[1:03:44] preached. Oh God, may it be Lord Father
[1:03:48] the water of
[1:03:50] separation that is sprinkled upon the
[1:03:52] people this
[1:03:53] morning in acceptance of our sacrifice.
[1:03:56] We love you. We appreciate you father.
[1:04:00] In Jesus name we pray.
[1:04:03] Amen.
[1:04:05] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you
[1:04:09] musicians. That will be it for the music
[1:04:11] for
[1:04:21] now. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:34] Once again we want to thank the Lord for
[1:04:37] giving us u
[1:04:39] another privilege. Let's uh stand on our
[1:04:42] feet and we want to read the scripture
[1:04:44] this uh this
[1:04:52] morning. I've been thinking about how to
[1:04:56] bring this this morning. I don't know if
[1:04:59] I found the best way, but I'm going to
[1:05:00] trust the Lord. 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:04] 4 verse 7. 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:09] 4 verse 7. Praise the
[1:05:15] Lord. I was expecting to do a baptism
[1:05:18] this morning, but I don't know if my
[1:05:21] candidate show
[1:05:22] up. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:27] Amen. Well, this uh uh uh
[1:05:32] uh if he didn't show up, then I believe
[1:05:35] uh you know, the devil uh is waring
[1:05:38] against him.
[1:05:42] And as as uh you know as it might it
[1:05:45] might sound to you a little bit funny
[1:05:48] but a young man I don't know from which
[1:05:51] direction around here he came into
[1:05:53] church on Sunday and spoke with brother
[1:05:57] Dan and then after service uh uh you
[1:06:01] know brother Dan brought him to the
[1:06:03] office uh to talk to me and and then I
[1:06:06] was just you know trying to talk to him
[1:06:08] a little bit and find out what was going
[1:06:10] on He says, "Well, I uh I want to be
[1:06:16] baptized." I says, "Uh" I said, "Okay."
[1:06:20] And he said, "Uh, you know,
[1:06:25] u I've always known that there is God,
[1:06:29] but this is my first time in
[1:06:32] church." And I told him, I said, "Okay."
[1:06:35] So we talked a little bit and I could
[1:06:38] just see, you know, the the sincerity of
[1:06:40] his young heart and I says, "Are you
[1:06:43] ready to be baptized? Do you came with a
[1:06:46] change of clothes?" He said, "No." I
[1:06:49] said, "Well, if you came with a change
[1:06:51] of clothes, I'll baptize you right
[1:06:54] now." Because you
[1:06:56] see, the thief on the cross never have
[1:06:59] that privilege. That's right.
[1:07:01] I will not care what your doctrine of
[1:07:03] view is and what you would think about
[1:07:05] me. I only cared about what God would
[1:07:08] think about me. Yeah. Because for the
[1:07:11] matter of fact that is there I didn't
[1:07:14] preach to him. You never invited him.
[1:07:17] That's right. And if he comes here and
[1:07:19] he tell me he want to be baptized. I
[1:07:22] don't care which church he went to.
[1:07:24] Right. What are his what the condition
[1:07:27] of his parents' life? If they were in
[1:07:29] church or not, if he was ready, I'll
[1:07:31] baptize him. And if he show up this
[1:07:34] morning and he want to be baptized, I
[1:07:36] will baptize him. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:40] Jesus condemned the Pharisees of not
[1:07:44] wanting to enter the kingdom and also
[1:07:46] stopping people from entering the
[1:07:49] kingdom. Right?
[1:07:52] So uh let's read uh 2 Corinthian chapter
[1:07:57] 4 and we will read verse
[1:08:01] 7. I'm really really trusting the Lord.
[1:08:04] I can be be a little bit dramatic this
[1:08:07] morning. I want to dramatize what I want
[1:08:10] to preach, but I don't know
[1:08:13] how how I'm able to do
[1:08:17] it because I'm not too much of a funny
[1:08:21] character. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:25] So 2 Corinthian chapter 4 verse 7, but
[1:08:29] we have this treasure in effing
[1:08:34] vessel that the excellency of the power
[1:08:37] may be of God and not of us. Now you
[1:08:41] think about that. What is the
[1:08:44] treasure? We have this treasure. What is
[1:08:47] the treasure? Christ in you. The hope of
[1:08:51] glory.
[1:08:53] Praise the Lord. We have this treasure
[1:08:56] in effing vessel that the excellency is
[1:09:00] not about the vessel. It's not about
[1:09:03] you. The excellency is about the
[1:09:06] treasure. God is more concerned that
[1:09:10] that treasure be preserved. He's more
[1:09:13] concerned that the treasure be
[1:09:15] protected.
[1:09:16] Even if the even if the the vessel is
[1:09:19] hit left and right, but let the treasure
[1:09:23] be preserved.
[1:09:25] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:28] Let's read a little
[1:09:30] bit. We are troubled on every side yet
[1:09:34] not distressed.
[1:09:36] We are perplexed but not in despair.
[1:09:39] Persecuted
[1:09:41] but not forsaken. Cast down but not
[1:09:45] destroyed. Amen.
[1:09:47] Always bearing about in the body the
[1:09:51] dying of the Lord
[1:09:53] Jesus that the life which is the
[1:09:58] treasure also of Jesus might be made
[1:10:02] manifest in our
[1:10:04] body. 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:10:08] 4. First Thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:10:29] 1 Thessalonians chapter 4. Let's read
[1:10:32] reading from verse one.
[1:10:41] Furthermore, then we beseech you,
[1:10:43] brethrens, and exalt you by the Lord
[1:10:46] Jesus, that as ye have received of us
[1:10:50] how ye ought to walk, and to please
[1:10:54] God, so ye who abound more and more. For
[1:10:59] ye know what commandment we give you by
[1:11:03] the Lord
[1:11:04] Jesus. For this is the will of
[1:11:07] God, even your
[1:11:11] sanctification, that you should esteem
[1:11:14] from
[1:11:16] fornication, that every one of you
[1:11:19] should know how to
[1:11:22] possess his vessel in
[1:11:25] sanctification and honor. Let us pray.
[1:11:29] Dear Lord, we just want to thank you,
[1:11:31] Father. We appreciate you, oh God,
[1:11:34] for having the privilege to read your
[1:11:37] divine word. I need your help this
[1:11:40] morning, Lord. That Father God, we will
[1:11:43] be able to say something that will draw
[1:11:45] your people closer to you. Bless us now
[1:11:49] in Jesus name. Amen. The Lord bless you.
[1:11:52] You may have your seat.
[1:11:55] It's uh I mean uh strange to be able to
[1:11:58] take this as uh uh mother's day message
[1:12:04] but uh I want to talk about
[1:12:06] mother as as a vessel of
[1:12:11] honor. Praise the Lord. I want to talk
[1:12:14] about mother as a vessel of honor. I
[1:12:16] want to talk about mother. I want to
[1:12:18] talk about uh a woman as a vessel
[1:12:22] because when you look in the scripture
[1:12:24] even though right here Paul is talking
[1:12:26] to the Thessalonian church and say we
[1:12:29] must possess let every man possess his
[1:12:31] vessel but uh distribly in the Bible.
[1:12:35] The Bible call woman a weaker vessel.
[1:12:38] Praise the Lord. So in a general sense
[1:12:41] we are a vessel and in a unique sense a
[1:12:45] woman is a vessel the weaker vessel.
[1:12:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:51] That the word weaker vessel uh uh is
[1:12:55] being
[1:12:56] misunderstood. That word being really
[1:12:59] misunderstood. Uh uh but I pray that as
[1:13:03] we go into what we want to talk about
[1:13:05] this morning, we can be able to find a
[1:13:09] way to bring it that would be a
[1:13:12] blessing. Praise the
[1:13:13] Lord. And uh I was
[1:13:21] uh as I was uh
[1:13:25] uh
[1:13:27] studying, I came across I I I came
[1:13:30] across this and and what actually it was
[1:13:33] is that the when you listen to God in
[1:13:36] simplicity and that was just before the
[1:13:38] opening of the series uh uh brother
[1:13:41] Brandon preached that message God in
[1:13:43] simplicity and he was just talking about
[1:13:45] how simple you know that God made
[1:13:49] himself how simple he reveal his word to
[1:13:52] his people he's hid in simplicity is
[1:13:55] also revealed in
[1:13:57] simplicity and uh uh but just before
[1:14:01] that that will be before the dedication
[1:14:05] of uh of the new church he did a wedding
[1:14:09] he did a wedding uh right in his office
[1:14:12] where he blessed a young man and a young
[1:14:15] woman and he said this let's let's just
[1:14:19] take there that's on my note first duty
[1:14:22] he said this he said you
[1:14:24] know and you might have wondered a few
[1:14:27] minute ago why I was so long coming out.
[1:14:32] My first
[1:14:35] duty. Praise the Lord. He called that
[1:14:39] his first
[1:14:41] duty. As I come into the new church, I
[1:14:45] married a young man and a woman standing
[1:14:48] in my
[1:14:49] office. May it be a type that I will be
[1:14:54] lawyer. I will be a lawyer minister to
[1:14:58] Christ to uh to get a bride ready for
[1:15:04] the ceremony of that day.
[1:15:08] But what attracted me was what he
[1:15:11] referred to as my first duty coming into
[1:15:15] coming into the new church coming into
[1:15:17] dedicating the church. Y said I have the
[1:15:20] opportunity that my first duty is to be
[1:15:24] able to unite a man, a young man and a
[1:15:28] young woman now because that is what uh
[1:15:33] uh uh redemption is all
[1:15:38] about. Is heaven and earth
[1:15:42] embracing? Is God and humanity
[1:15:45] embracing? Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:15:49] And uh to me it was is very unique that
[1:15:52] he will call that his first
[1:15:54] duty and to to take that in his mind and
[1:15:58] says I I you know I pray that doing that
[1:16:01] will be an example that my ministry will
[1:16:04] be able to unite people with Christ.
[1:16:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:12] And you know when you start to study it
[1:16:15] like that you come across something a
[1:16:18] you know it it leave you to look into
[1:16:20] okay let me look into other first duty
[1:16:23] and see what he said were first duty. So
[1:16:27] uh uh he said this one also Jehovah Gara
[1:16:31] he said remember when you are sick your
[1:16:34] first duty is to see your
[1:16:38] doctor and see what he
[1:16:41] says and then if he diagnose the case or
[1:16:48] something that he can science has not
[1:16:51] been able to reveal to him uh reveal to
[1:16:54] him any help for you then you have a
[1:16:57] right to come to God. He is the great
[1:17:00] physician and pray and have and have
[1:17:04] prayer pray over
[1:17:07] you. They do it should do it in every
[1:17:10] Christian church. Praise the Lord. But
[1:17:13] that he will consider seeing your doctor
[1:17:16] to be your first student. I also believe
[1:17:18] there because I believe God is the one
[1:17:22] that have blessed medical science. Amen.
[1:17:24] Amen. Uh for them to be able to come up
[1:17:27] with the kind of a diagnosis that they
[1:17:29] are giving us that is uh uh very
[1:17:33] tremendous. But he will call that a
[1:17:34] first duty. The first duty is to go and
[1:17:37] see your doctor. The reason there is
[1:17:39] that you will just be guessing. You
[1:17:43] would not know what to bring before God
[1:17:46] in faith.
[1:17:48] Praise the Lord. You will be
[1:17:50] guessing. Are we together? So I think
[1:17:53] that that was a beautiful thing that he
[1:17:56] will call that first duty. Let's look at
[1:17:59] another first
[1:18:01] duty. Let us see God. But you know I
[1:18:04] feel like this that a member of a
[1:18:07] church their first
[1:18:10] obligation is uh with their tithes and
[1:18:14] offering is to support their church. If
[1:18:16] you are a member of uh of of these fine
[1:18:20] fine churches that represent here, you
[1:18:22] support your church. That's your first
[1:18:25] duty to God. Bring your tithes and
[1:18:28] offering into the storehouse. And the
[1:18:31] storehouse uh you surely know what that
[1:18:35] is. Is where you get your food. So there
[1:18:39] is where you get your spiritual food and
[1:18:43] your obligation is to your church and
[1:18:46] not to an evangelist like me. Amen.
[1:18:50] Okay. So that's your first duty to your
[1:18:52] local church, your first duty to your
[1:18:55] health and your first duty. Okay, that
[1:18:58] that was his first duty. Let's look at
[1:19:00] another first duty. Maybe this will turn
[1:19:02] the corner for
[1:19:05] us. and uh faith in the son of
[1:19:09] god. I found a I found a young lady that
[1:19:12] I really love and I asked her if she
[1:19:16] thought that much of me. She said yes.
[1:19:20] So we got married and I told her now
[1:19:25] look all my love I gave to you.
[1:19:30] No matter what other women are, that
[1:19:35] woman has my
[1:19:38] love. Perhaps I go down the street and
[1:19:41] here come a more attractive girl than my
[1:19:46] wife. Sometimes you have to admit there.
[1:19:49] It's a meeting there. And she said, "Oh,
[1:19:52] Belly, I really love you with all my
[1:19:55] heart."
[1:19:56] Now the first place if she has a law for
[1:20:02] me it bound to be false right
[1:20:08] cuz my first
[1:20:11] duty is to what I pledge to my
[1:20:17] wife. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:20] Amen.
[1:20:23] Like I said
[1:20:25] before, when
[1:20:27] Eve disobeyed God before Adam, when she
[1:20:31] got to Adam and told what Adam, I mean
[1:20:35] told Adam what she
[1:20:39] did, if you read the Bible closely,
[1:20:42] you'll realize there was not lot of
[1:20:44] fussing and uh you know and and
[1:20:48] argument. Adam quickly identified
[1:20:52] himself with the wrong of his wife to
[1:20:55] redeem her. Why?
[1:20:59] Because there was no second option. She
[1:21:03] was the only woman.
[1:21:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:10] She was the only woman.
[1:21:13] So I mean uh uh he never thought in his
[1:21:17] mind and you know I I I'll put this
[1:21:19] woman away and find another way. Where
[1:21:21] is he going to get her from?
[1:21:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. You see, so uh
[1:21:29] the the the the society makes us to
[1:21:32] think that we have lot of options
[1:21:36] and that is the reason why you know uh
[1:21:41] uh many people don't value their
[1:21:44] marriage
[1:21:45] coveting because they think there are
[1:21:47] other option there are better
[1:21:49] options. So I like the way he said it
[1:21:52] here. She will be completely
[1:21:54] wrong. She will be wrong to say she
[1:21:57] loved me because that love portion in me
[1:22:00] I have already given it out.
[1:22:04] Are we together? He says my first
[1:22:08] duty is to
[1:22:12] her. If if if if she if she has a love
[1:22:16] for me, it bound to be false cuz my
[1:22:19] first duty is to what I pledge to my
[1:22:23] wife.
[1:22:25] That's that's her first. I have got to
[1:22:29] think of her
[1:22:31] first. She's my first. I told her I did
[1:22:36] give her all my
[1:22:39] love. And then my first duty is to my
[1:22:45] wife. Now look sister see
[1:22:49] you you are just
[1:22:54] uh infatuated or something
[1:22:58] because because you are not in love.
[1:23:02] See, and I'm not in love with you
[1:23:06] because I love one
[1:23:09] woman. That's the mother of my children.
[1:23:13] See, that's my first duty. Praise the
[1:23:17] Lord.
[1:23:19] That's in in your love life. That's in
[1:23:23] your home. Your first duty is to your
[1:23:25] wife. Praise the Lord. And uh sometimes
[1:23:29] society want to make us to think the
[1:23:31] children is first. No, your wife is
[1:23:34] first. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:23:37] Your husband also is first.
[1:23:43] Are we together?
[1:23:45] You see a balance?
[1:23:48] Because the room is getting quiet on
[1:23:50] me. I'm feeling your vow.
[1:23:55] Are we together?
[1:23:58] Okay. Now, so uh that is that is that uh
[1:24:02] that is just a little uh side note that
[1:24:05] I just I just started looking into first
[1:24:07] detail on different things through the
[1:24:09] scripture and all of that. Now, so we
[1:24:12] want to talk this morning about uh
[1:24:14] heavenly treasure in vessel possessing
[1:24:17] your vessel. And uh and the way I want
[1:24:20] to talk about it now follow me now. Like
[1:24:23] I said, I want I want to see if I can
[1:24:25] dramatize this and and bring us to the
[1:24:28] place so you can be able to get the
[1:24:30] picture of where I want to drive to. And
[1:24:34] uh uh
[1:24:36] uh the Bible will say in the book of
[1:24:41] Matthew, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:45] The Bible says in
[1:24:47] Matthew chapter 1 or chapter 2, I think
[1:24:51] we we were there some time ago.
[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:19] Matthew
[1:25:22] chapter 1 verse 18. Now the birth of
[1:25:25] Jesus Christ was on this
[1:25:28] wise when as his mother Mary was espouse
[1:25:33] to
[1:25:34] Joseph before they came together she was
[1:25:38] found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then
[1:25:43] Joseph her husband being a just man now
[1:25:47] willing to make a public example was
[1:25:50] mindful to put her away privately. Now
[1:25:54] look at this. Now follow me. Now I'm
[1:25:56] trying to to play a drama out here for
[1:25:58] you so you can see
[1:26:01] it. We're talking about
[1:26:04] uh uh treasures and
[1:26:06] vessels. Okay. And uh uh Paul says you
[1:26:12] have this treasure in effing vessel. And
[1:26:16] what is the treasure? He show it to us
[1:26:18] there in the scripture. It's Christ in
[1:26:20] you. The hope of glory.
[1:26:23] Okay, you have Christ in you. The book
[1:26:26] of Ecclesiastic said, every man, every
[1:26:30] man
[1:26:32] has a portion of their maker in
[1:26:35] them. Are we together?
[1:26:38] Okay. Now, so uh uh
[1:26:43] uh so here is Mary here. Now, we will
[1:26:46] take Mary as a type of our vessel. She
[1:26:50] was uh a virgin. And she was uh uh you
[1:26:54] know a a vessel that had not been
[1:26:57] touched. And the Bible says she was
[1:27:00] going to be found with child of the Holy
[1:27:02] Ghost. So that child of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:05] was going to be the treasure.
[1:27:09] Are we together?
[1:27:12] Okay. Now Mary, a type of the
[1:27:17] vessel, the child is the treasure. He's
[1:27:21] He's the treasure that the word needed.
[1:27:23] Amen. He was going to be a gift to the
[1:27:26] word. Amen. Are we together? Praise the
[1:27:29] Lord.
[1:27:31] Did I say happy mother's day? Did I say
[1:27:34] it? Okay, I say it again. Happy Mother's
[1:27:36] Day. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:40] And uh uh but here said that
[1:27:44] God will also choose a
[1:27:49] man. And the
[1:27:51] Bible has a reason why it makes certain
[1:27:54] statement. The Bible say and Joseph was
[1:27:58] a just man.
[1:28:01] Praise the
[1:28:03] Lord. A just man. A righteous man. A man
[1:28:07] that fears the Lord.
[1:28:10] So God will now also choose this
[1:28:13] man Joseph. What is his
[1:28:17] role? Mary is the the vessel. The child
[1:28:22] is the treasure that is the gift to the
[1:28:24] word. Then what is Joseph
[1:28:28] role? Praise the Lord. If you if you
[1:28:32] read a little bit of history, you'll
[1:28:34] find out that Joseph was a wealth.
[1:28:38] He has got married, lost his wife, and
[1:28:40] so he was far older than Mary. And uh uh
[1:28:44] and I believe there were other, you
[1:28:47] know, other young men that was pretty
[1:28:49] much the same age, two years, three
[1:28:51] years older than married or four,
[1:28:53] whatever age it was. But God will design
[1:28:57] it that this young woman will fall in
[1:29:01] the life of a
[1:29:03] man with
[1:29:05] experience. Praise the Lord. a man that
[1:29:08] fear the Lord. It is God's design. Why?
[1:29:12] Because Joseph is now going to be used
[1:29:16] as a protector. Right? There is a gift
[1:29:20] coming into the word. Mary is the
[1:29:23] treasure that is carrying the gift. God
[1:29:27] need to find a man that will protect the
[1:29:31] gift.
[1:29:33] Are we together? Amen.
[1:29:36] Praise the Lord. Amen. Are you seeing
[1:29:39] the picture?
[1:29:41] Amen.
[1:29:43] So, Joseph will play the role as a
[1:29:47] protector. Because if you if you if if
[1:29:50] we actually look into the word, you
[1:29:52] realize that that is the role of the
[1:29:55] man, that is the role of the husband,
[1:29:58] that is the role of the father. He's
[1:30:01] supposed to be a protector
[1:30:04] and a provider. Are we together?
[1:30:07] So you seeing the picture now we are
[1:30:10] looking at this this uh having this
[1:30:13] treasure in e
[1:30:16] vessel. Are we together?
[1:30:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:23] Because if you go back, if you go back
[1:30:26] to
[1:30:27] Genesis, the Bible make us to know that
[1:30:31] God make man in his image, male and
[1:30:34] female, he created them. That's Genesis
[1:30:38] 1:26. And in his image, which made their
[1:30:41] first form, they were spirit. And then
[1:30:44] Genesis 2:7, the Bible says, "God then
[1:30:47] form men of the dust of the earth where
[1:30:49] he will put their spirit being in their
[1:30:52] flesh body." Are we together? Amen. But
[1:30:55] at the time he would do
[1:30:58] it, he will only make Adam
[1:31:02] visible and Eve will be invincible.
[1:31:07] Are we together? Amen. So after the
[1:31:10] period of time Adam was dead and and and
[1:31:12] and
[1:31:15] lonely, the Bible says, "And God will
[1:31:18] cause a deep sleep to fall on
[1:31:21] Adam and then he will take a rift from
[1:31:25] Adam and then he will form the woman."
[1:31:29] Now keep in mind
[1:31:33] now why will God bring the woman
[1:31:38] later? Because the protector has to be a
[1:31:42] person of experience,
[1:31:45] not a novice.
[1:31:51] Are we together? Amen. I'm dramatizing
[1:31:54] now. Amen. The protector has to be
[1:31:57] somebody of
[1:31:59] experience. So he was there then you
[1:32:02] know he named the animals. He's all over
[1:32:04] the place. He knows the ground. Let's
[1:32:05] say it like that. He knows the ground.
[1:32:08] He knows the
[1:32:09] tearing. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:32:13] And now God is going to bring this
[1:32:17] vessel and this vessel is going to have
[1:32:21] a treasure in it.
[1:32:24] If you are familiar with our language, I
[1:32:26] will read some of that to you this
[1:32:28] morning. God gave her three sacred
[1:32:32] virtue. That was God's treasure. He did
[1:32:36] not give it to the man. Yeah.
[1:32:39] And the reason why he gave it to the
[1:32:41] woman was for redemption. Amen.
[1:32:44] Redemption is God's purpose of creation.
[1:32:47] Yes.
[1:32:50] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Redemption
[1:32:53] is God's purpose for
[1:32:57] creation. If God never had a plan of
[1:33:00] redemption, he was not going to create
[1:33:02] anything.
[1:33:07] Are we together?
[1:33:12] Are you enjoying the drama so far? Am I
[1:33:14] confusing you? Is the characters the
[1:33:17] characters so mixed up? Praise the Lord.
[1:33:21] But here is it said we see here that uh
[1:33:24] uh uh
[1:33:28] uh the vessel had a
[1:33:33] treasure and uh and and and and three
[1:33:38] sacred virtue that God gave to the
[1:33:43] woman. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:46] And
[1:33:47] uh she's to be born as a
[1:33:51] virgin. God put in her to be a
[1:33:55] mother. A woman her womanhood that has
[1:33:59] to do with her character, her decency
[1:34:03] and also her motherhood, a carrier of
[1:34:09] life. Are we together?
[1:34:13] I was listening to something this
[1:34:15] morning and uh I think mother's dead and
[1:34:18] and uh you know uh brother Brown was
[1:34:20] talking about the ten commandments when
[1:34:23] uh uh when when Jacob and and uh and
[1:34:27] Moses daughter was arguing over Moses
[1:34:31] you know and she was trying to tell uh
[1:34:34] you know uh how I have given you a
[1:34:36] better life you know I took you from the
[1:34:39] water I given you you know a school and
[1:34:42] I I I make you with prince and I make
[1:34:45] you
[1:34:47] everything and Jacob
[1:34:50] said I gave him life.
[1:34:55] That's where it begins from.
[1:34:58] If you didn't have life, you won't have
[1:35:00] what you have.
[1:35:02] That's where it begins
[1:35:04] from. Mother, that's where it begins
[1:35:07] from.
[1:35:12] Are we together?
[1:35:14] We can we can break and boast in our our
[1:35:18] status, you know, our what whatever
[1:35:21] whatever we we we think that is good to
[1:35:23] boast in, but if you don't have life,
[1:35:26] you won't you won't have those status.
[1:35:29] That's right. That's where it starts
[1:35:31] from.
[1:35:33] She said, "But I gave him life." And
[1:35:35] that was the end of the argument. And uh
[1:35:38] so uh so that's that's that's what I
[1:35:41] want us to see. That's what I want us to
[1:35:44] see because as we as we talk about
[1:35:47] h mother's dead or motherhood and uh it
[1:35:52] it brings us to this place of the
[1:35:54] woman and I think society has
[1:35:59] misunderstood the place of the woman as
[1:36:02] much as the church.
[1:36:05] You know, as I was studying this, I I I
[1:36:08] I wrote a little note in that I did not
[1:36:10] want to forget because, you know, I'm
[1:36:13] not smart.
[1:36:15] So I have to write things to remind
[1:36:19] myself and song comes by
[1:36:23] inspiration you know
[1:36:31] uh if we don't understand the place of
[1:36:34] the woman the church will never be
[1:36:38] successful
[1:36:39] in fulfilling her place in God's
[1:36:43] program. Amen. Praise the Lord. Because
[1:36:47] what the Paul says,
[1:36:53] men, love your wife as Christ, woman,
[1:36:56] your husband as the what?
[1:37:01] Church. So in God's program of
[1:37:05] redemption, he brought this woman to
[1:37:08] represent what he will achieve in their
[1:37:12] church.
[1:37:14] He starts with one
[1:37:16] woman what he will achieve in the
[1:37:19] church.
[1:37:23] Are we together? Amen. Because when you
[1:37:26] when you when you when you actually look
[1:37:28] at it, I mean we are the church. We are
[1:37:32] the bra of Christ. Are we together? The
[1:37:36] only male in the house of God is Christ
[1:37:38] the word.
[1:37:41] Christ is the male.
[1:37:44] Amen. The word is the male.
[1:37:48] The body is the female.
[1:37:56] So if we don't understand the place of
[1:37:59] the woman, the church will never be
[1:38:03] successful. That's right.
[1:38:06] She will never be successful because we
[1:38:07] will be out of place.
[1:38:14] we will be out of place. We will be we
[1:38:17] will be competing with God. That's the
[1:38:20] reason why when a man gets to the place
[1:38:22] when a preacher gets to the place where
[1:38:25] he thinks that his saying is the final
[1:38:28] saying you you will not get in
[1:38:31] competition with the word. The final
[1:38:32] saying is this book
[1:38:35] not not my word. I'm only repeating what
[1:38:38] he says.
[1:38:40] My decision is not a final saying I must
[1:38:43] be submissive to this word.
[1:38:48] Are you seeing the picture?
[1:38:50] So you see that is the reason why we
[1:38:52] have had lot of struggle and lot of
[1:38:56] misrepresentation when it comes to the
[1:38:58] church
[1:39:00] because the place of the woman is
[1:39:02] completely
[1:39:05] misunderstood. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:08] is completely
[1:39:11] misunderstood and just to start is not a
[1:39:14] kitchen either.
[1:39:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:23] Amen. Somebody said thank
[1:39:29] you. Let's let's let's fellowship with
[1:39:32] the word. Let's let's not get into
[1:39:33] because I'm I'm not coming here as a
[1:39:35] woman uh lawyer.
[1:39:39] Okay. I'm I'm I'm trying to to put every
[1:39:42] one of us in the middle of the word.
[1:39:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:48] Amen. Amen. So it is not the thing to go
[1:39:52] after the man and say all of these men
[1:39:54] they are wrong and or or not not not
[1:39:57] either to go at the other place and say
[1:40:00] so that's the reason what I told you
[1:40:02] this morning is it's this is you know
[1:40:06] it's it's it's been kind of overweight
[1:40:09] me and I was really thinking am I really
[1:40:11] to bring this up but it's Mother's Day
[1:40:13] anyway. Praise the Lord. Amen. So I
[1:40:16] said, "Well, let me keep it and see if
[1:40:17] we can if we can treat it as a mother
[1:40:21] day
[1:40:22] subject." Praise the Lord.
[1:40:27] But if we if we if we want to be earnest
[1:40:31] with ourself, if we want to be earnest
[1:40:34] with ourself, we will realize that
[1:40:39] uh many of us have not understand our
[1:40:43] role and our position in the body of
[1:40:46] Christ. And it all goes back to this
[1:40:49] because we have not understand the role
[1:40:51] of a woman.
[1:40:56] Women also do not understand their role
[1:40:58] in the scripture. I remember one one uh
[1:41:02] uh young sister myself talking about it
[1:41:04] and she said to me why why why is it why
[1:41:07] should we be like it's it's just all
[1:41:10] male character in the Bible. The Bible
[1:41:12] is just full of male character than
[1:41:15] female. So it's almost like the woman is
[1:41:19] left out.
[1:41:22] Praise the Lord. But you have to
[1:41:24] realize, you have to realize and
[1:41:26] understand her strength is in the dark,
[1:41:30] right? God created
[1:41:32] darkness. Her strain is not visible.
[1:41:36] Amen.
[1:41:37] It's in the dark.
[1:41:41] Praise the Lord. It looks like it looks
[1:41:45] like the Bible does not talk a lot about
[1:41:48] women when
[1:41:51] actually it magnified the office or the
[1:41:55] place of the woman.
[1:42:00] Glory be to God. Amen.
[1:42:03] Are we going in life?
[1:42:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:11] Amen. and they all thinking what is he
[1:42:14] preaching there this
[1:42:18] morning. If he don't have nothing to
[1:42:20] preach, he just shut up his mouth.
[1:42:25] But I'm so glad I have a group of people
[1:42:27] that love to hear me. Amen.
[1:42:32] Now,
[1:42:33] so just like, you know, just like I said
[1:42:36] a couple of weeks ago and uh and and I I
[1:42:39] realized a few people uh uh took my bed
[1:42:42] and and they started reading the book of
[1:42:44] Proverb. And uh uh but if you read the
[1:42:47] book of Proverb, you realize that
[1:42:49] Solomon speaks a whole lot. There is
[1:42:51] nowhere where Solomon says, "My
[1:42:52] daughter, hear the counsel of your
[1:42:55] father."
[1:42:56] He said, "My son, my son, yeah, the
[1:42:59] advice of your mother. My son, yeah, the
[1:43:02] counsel of your father."
[1:43:07] But when he would talk about the
[1:43:10] woman, he will
[1:43:15] says, "Wisdom build her house." Amen.
[1:43:22] And he will says,
[1:43:26] "Wisdom was with me in the
[1:43:30] beginning. Wisdom helped me to form the
[1:43:34] earth." Now he will give the woman such
[1:43:38] a place. He will give the woman the
[1:43:41] personality of
[1:43:44] Christ. Because Paul will tell us that
[1:43:48] Jesus Christ is the power and the wisdom
[1:43:51] of God. That's what Paul will
[1:43:55] say. And Solomon here in the book of
[1:43:58] Proverb, he's he's giving the woman such
[1:44:02] a place of
[1:44:03] Christ. Christ in bride
[1:44:07] form. Praise the Lord. Because you have
[1:44:10] to realize when God made man Genesis
[1:44:14] 1:26 he brought the both spirit male and
[1:44:18] female but in 27 he put the both spirit
[1:44:23] in Adam.
[1:44:25] Adam was possessing both the feminine
[1:44:28] and the masculine spirit. Praise the
[1:44:31] Lord. Amen. So you see in the scripture
[1:44:35] Jesus Christ can be represented like uh
[1:44:39] take for example take for example uh uh
[1:44:42] uh uh uh who is the rose of Sharon?
[1:44:48] Who is the rose of Sharon? Jesus is the
[1:44:51] rose of Sharon. But the rose of Sharon
[1:44:54] is a is feminine. Amen.
[1:44:58] The lady of the valley. Who is the lady
[1:45:00] of the valley? Jesus. But is he meeting?
[1:45:03] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] Are we together? Amen.
[1:45:17] So you see just like how Adam in the
[1:45:20] beginning possessed both the masculine
[1:45:23] and the
[1:45:25] feminine spirit, gender, nature. It is
[1:45:29] the same way that Christ possessed both
[1:45:32] far feminine and and masculine. He said,
[1:45:36] "Oh Israel, how I will have love to har
[1:45:40] you.
[1:45:40] Like a hen will have her. It's not the
[1:45:43] rooster that have her cheeks. That's
[1:45:45] right.
[1:45:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:53] So you see the the the the the wrong
[1:45:57] concept where it looks like the whole
[1:46:00] thing about re religion is is is is just
[1:46:04] men dominates.
[1:46:06] That's wrong. That's devilish.
[1:46:12] It's not men dominance. It's not women
[1:46:14] dominance. No, no, no, no.
[1:46:18] It's both of us coming under God's
[1:46:20] headship. That's right.
[1:46:26] Are we together?
[1:46:32] Are we together?
[1:46:42] Mommy already say it's your birthday.
[1:46:43] You told me happy
[1:46:52] birthday. And
[1:46:55] uh
[1:46:56] uh are we together?
[1:47:16] You love the Lord. I sure you
[1:47:19] do. I'm very sure you do. you not
[1:47:23] be kind of a bearing with this with this
[1:47:27] guy that
[1:47:30] I I'm trying
[1:47:32] to really trying to to be able to bring
[1:47:36] this thing together. But uh I wanted to
[1:47:39] build that picture of the vessel and the
[1:47:42] treasure. Paul said we have this
[1:47:44] treasure in the effing
[1:47:47] vessel that the excellency must be of
[1:47:50] God.
[1:47:51] Amen. Amen. He knows our weaknesses. He
[1:47:55] knows our failures. He knows our
[1:47:58] limitation. But yet he choose to use us
[1:48:02] as a vessel.
[1:48:05] Praise the Lord. Yes, he choose to put
[1:48:09] his love in our
[1:48:11] heart. Yet he choose to put his spirit
[1:48:15] in our life.
[1:48:18] Praise the Lord. Amen. So if you if you
[1:48:21] cannot be able to differentiate and
[1:48:25] understand the place of the
[1:48:28] vessel and the place of the
[1:48:32] treasure, you will always run into
[1:48:36] crisis because you will be making God
[1:48:39] your failure.
[1:48:41] God never fail and he cannot be your
[1:48:44] failure.
[1:48:47] Are we together? Amen.
[1:48:49] Amen. He never failed and he cannot be
[1:48:53] your failure.
[1:48:56] Are we together? So just like the Bible
[1:49:00] says the birth of Jesus was on this
[1:49:02] wires. I took a I took I don't know a
[1:49:05] month or six month just preaching on the
[1:49:07] same thing. I hope able to bring out
[1:49:10] something from there. But we looking at
[1:49:13] it in a picture this morning where God
[1:49:17] through the prophet Isaiah he said a
[1:49:19] virgin shall conceive. So he took a
[1:49:22] virgin as a vessel because he was going
[1:49:25] to bring this great treasure. He was
[1:49:27] going to to to to come in flesh in body
[1:49:31] and
[1:49:32] uh and and and that's the place as we go
[1:49:35] along you will be able to see it. That's
[1:49:38] also where the mystery of the Godhead is
[1:49:43] hidden because in as much
[1:49:47] as
[1:49:49] where we don't
[1:49:53] understand the covenant of cold equal
[1:49:57] that God gave to the man and the woman
[1:50:00] is a covenant of equality that is under
[1:50:04] her shape.
[1:50:07] Praise the Lord. It's never God's never
[1:50:10] God's intention for one person to rule
[1:50:13] the other.
[1:50:18] Nope. Nope. Because you I can't even
[1:50:21] rule myself.
[1:50:24] God cannot trust you with yourself.
[1:50:28] If he leave you with yourself, you will
[1:50:30] make a mess. Why should he trust you
[1:50:32] with somebody else? Yeah. Come on. Amen.
[1:50:35] Amen.
[1:50:37] That's right.
[1:50:39] Praise the Lord. Yeah, I know all your
[1:50:42] all your scriptural bubbles are
[1:50:45] popping. I'm not worried about
[1:50:48] it. I'm not worried about
[1:50:51] it. All your scriptural ideas, the
[1:50:54] Bible, they are all popping. I can hear
[1:50:55] it.
[1:50:59] But this is where the rubber meets the
[1:51:01] road. Let's talk about reality.
[1:51:05] If God will leave you, leave me to
[1:51:07] myself, leave me to myself, I make a
[1:51:10] mess.
[1:51:18] If I will make a mess with my own life,
[1:51:21] then why will he want to trust me to
[1:51:24] think that I have a natural ability to
[1:51:28] take care of these people? That's the
[1:51:30] reason why Solomon caught the heart of
[1:51:33] God when he said, "Oh God, your people
[1:51:36] are a great people. Give me wisdom that
[1:51:39] I will be able to go in and come out."
[1:51:43] He caught the heart of God. Because he
[1:51:46] realized
[1:51:48] he caught the secret that you need God
[1:51:51] and his wisdom. That's right. To deal
[1:51:53] with God's people. You need God and his
[1:51:56] wisdom to deal with your wife. to deal
[1:51:59] with your husband, to deal with your
[1:52:02] children, you need God and his wisdom.
[1:52:05] Amen.
[1:52:07] That's true. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:12] Or else you make your mess and then you
[1:52:15] be gone. We don't know where you are.
[1:52:18] The police can't find
[1:52:21] you. You change your name. You change
[1:52:23] your address.
[1:52:25] Praise the Lord. Find a new haircut.
[1:52:33] Are we together?
[1:52:41] That's the reason why I've always told
[1:52:44] people, don't preach King's gospel to
[1:52:48] me. People say we must be about uh what
[1:52:52] did he say? Am I I'm my brother's
[1:52:54] keeper.
[1:52:57] That's King's gospel.
[1:53:01] That Cain arrogant gospel, right? King
[1:53:05] was talking to God. Am I my brother's
[1:53:07] keeper?
[1:53:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:13] David was the one that got the
[1:53:16] revelation. He says, "The Lord
[1:53:19] is our keeper."
[1:53:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:26] So it's the law that keeps us. Yes.
[1:53:34] And that's the place where we we we we
[1:53:37] grow the the the the the you know the
[1:53:40] the the character, you know, uh uh uh uh
[1:53:44] uh because we trust the Lord, we can be
[1:53:47] able to trust the Lord for our brother.
[1:53:49] We can be able to trust the Lord for our
[1:53:52] sister. We can be able to trust the Lord
[1:53:54] for our husband, trust the Lord for our
[1:53:58] wives because he's our keeper.
[1:54:02] I know the the the society had gave us
[1:54:05] GPS tracker. You can put tracker here.
[1:54:07] Tracker
[1:54:10] here. Only God can track the human soul.
[1:54:14] You can't track the human soul. Praise
[1:54:17] the Lord. You get all your apps
[1:54:26] Are we together?
[1:54:29] Am I making sense?
[1:54:34] Okay, then bear with me a little bit.
[1:54:37] Let's let's look at this uh as as we
[1:54:40] look at as we look at this treasure in
[1:54:43] vessel. I want to read this to you. I
[1:54:46] read it to you before for an invisible
[1:54:48] union. Uh I just I just took bullet
[1:54:50] points. I put bullet points together. So
[1:54:53] I'll read that to you. Invisible union.
[1:54:55] A woman is entrusted with certain
[1:54:57] character that she must not
[1:55:00] defy. A woman is trusted to death.
[1:55:05] There's not a creature on earth like a
[1:55:08] woman. She has also been given a sacred
[1:55:13] charge from God for redemption. That's a
[1:55:16] that's a direct code for redemption. So
[1:55:19] you have to you have to think about it
[1:55:22] that way.
[1:55:24] You have to think about it that
[1:55:27] way that her sacrifice is given to her
[1:55:31] for redemption because God in the back
[1:55:34] part of his mind knew that his plan of
[1:55:39] redemption somewhere in the plan there
[1:55:41] was going to come a
[1:55:43] fall and something was needed to bring
[1:55:46] man back.
[1:55:48] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:55:51] He never told Adam that the seed of the
[1:55:55] man will bruise the head of the w the
[1:55:56] serpent. No, he said the seed of the
[1:55:59] woman, the woman's seed will bruise the
[1:56:02] head of the serpent.
[1:56:06] Are we together?
[1:56:14] The woman is trusted to death. There's
[1:56:16] not a creature on the earth like a
[1:56:18] woman. She has been she she has also
[1:56:21] been given a sacred charge from God for
[1:56:24] redemption. The
[1:56:26] reason it's so sacred, she is to bring
[1:56:32] forth life into the
[1:56:34] earth. Are we together?
[1:56:39] That's committed to her. Sacred virtue,
[1:56:42] sacred womanhood, and then sac
[1:56:46] motherhood. honor her
[1:56:50] husband. Praise the Lord.
[1:56:55] Now, see what he says. Now, this is the
[1:56:56] part that I
[1:56:57] love. What What a sacra. What a
[1:57:01] responsibility to a woman. Now, see why
[1:57:06] she's a type of the
[1:57:08] church. Why she's a type of the church?
[1:57:10] Because you have to realize that God's
[1:57:14] interest is not just
[1:57:17] individual. God interest is his family.
[1:57:23] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:57:26] Is his family is the church.
[1:57:32] So in giving her this sacred
[1:57:35] trust in the back part of his mind will
[1:57:39] also be the the the the sacred thing
[1:57:42] that he will also give to the church.
[1:57:45] That will be the church power. That will
[1:57:48] be the engine room of the church. Now
[1:57:51] see why she's a type of the church which
[1:57:54] has the same
[1:57:56] responsibility as a woman has a sacra
[1:57:59] responsibility to to her motherhood to
[1:58:03] her virtue to her husband. The church
[1:58:06] has a sacra responsibility to prayer and
[1:58:11] to the word and to Christ just as the
[1:58:15] woman just the same as the woman has.
[1:58:21] Are we together
[1:58:24] now? So, uh uh uh we we we we have to
[1:58:29] see that and that's what I want for us
[1:58:31] to be able to to to realize that's on
[1:58:35] this that I I make that statement. If we
[1:58:38] don't understand the place of the
[1:58:41] woman, praise the Lord. The place of the
[1:58:45] woman is not to be inferior. God don't
[1:58:49] have no inferior part in his body.
[1:58:54] But what God has that I know is that he
[1:58:58] has unique parts.
[1:59:02] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:05] Instead of us looking at it as being
[1:59:08] inferior, we must understand it that
[1:59:11] it's unique. That's right. Like I said
[1:59:14] before, the reason why we misunderstand
[1:59:16] one another is because we are unique.
[1:59:20] Praise the Lord. Amen. We are peculiar.
[1:59:24] That's right. Amen.
[1:59:29] Are we together?
[1:59:32] And we don't even understand
[1:59:34] ourself. Why? Because we are designed by
[1:59:37] a peculiar God. Amen.
[1:59:40] We go on in life and then we discover
[1:59:43] certain things of ourel. Oh wow. Oh wow.
[1:59:45] He never knew I could do this. Oh why is
[1:59:48] now you find out? Praise the
[1:59:51] Lord. It's because our maker is
[1:59:54] peculiar. That's right. And he made us
[1:59:58] in a peculiar way.
[2:00:01] Are we together?
[2:00:04] So you see
[2:00:10] uh she has a
[2:00:13] place. Let's look at something
[2:00:15] here. Let's look at something
[2:00:21] here.
[2:00:25] Okay. I could use the time to hold you
[2:00:27] and use the time to escape.
[2:00:33] Are we together? Genesis chapter 3.
[2:00:41] Genesis chapter
[2:00:49] 3. Genesis chapter 3.
[2:01:01] Let's read Genesis chapter 3:15. Let's
[2:01:04] read the promise of redemption. Let's
[2:01:06] read about the re the redeemer. Verse
[2:01:09] 15, Genesis chapter 3. And I will put
[2:01:12] emity between thee and the woman. He's
[2:01:15] speaking to the serpent. God is speaking
[2:01:17] to the serpent. I will put emity between
[2:01:19] thee and the woman and between thy seed.
[2:01:24] Which mean the serpent have a seed.
[2:01:28] Okay. Between thy seed and her
[2:01:33] seed, it shall bruise the head. Which
[2:01:36] mean the woman's seed will bruise and
[2:01:38] crush the serpent head. Amen. Amen. Will
[2:01:41] crush the the head of the serpent seed.
[2:01:43] It shall bruise the head and thou shall
[2:01:46] bruise his he. You will always be coming
[2:01:48] against him, but he will finally crush
[2:01:50] you.
[2:01:52] Jesus said uh uh uh the gates of
[2:01:55] hell shall not prevail. Amen.
[2:02:00] It does not means that it will not come.
[2:02:02] It will come but it will never prevail.
[2:02:05] Amen. You will bruise his he but he
[2:02:08] going to bruise your head. He's going to
[2:02:10] crush you down.
[2:02:12] We will always come on attack just like
[2:02:15] Paul says we are despised here. I mean
[2:02:17] we we are we are placed in you know
[2:02:20] strange position discomfort places but
[2:02:23] we are we never been forsaken. Amen. God
[2:02:26] don't forsake his own.
[2:02:31] So we will always have these things
[2:02:33] coming after us. But the promise the
[2:02:36] promise on which we are called we will
[2:02:39] bruise his head. Amen. We will overcome
[2:02:42] it. Hallelujah.
[2:02:44] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:02:47] we will overcome it.
[2:02:50] And by the way, I think that was a good
[2:02:52] good service on Wednesday night. Amen.
[2:02:53] Amen. That was a beautiful service on
[2:02:55] Wednesday night. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:02:58] So now let's let's go there. I I keep
[2:03:01] talking like this and I lose lose track.
[2:03:03] Verse 16. Unto the woman he said, I will
[2:03:07] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[2:03:11] conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring
[2:03:14] forth children. So God is giving her the
[2:03:16] promise of life. Amen. God is giving her
[2:03:20] the promise of
[2:03:21] life. And that
[2:03:24] desire shall be to thy
[2:03:27] husband and he shall rule over thee. Are
[2:03:32] we together? Amen. He shall rule over
[2:03:35] thee. I want us to look at this word
[2:03:37] rude.
[2:03:39] That's what I bring that that's what I
[2:03:40] bring you for because that was those
[2:03:42] were some of the the bubbles that I hear
[2:03:44] popping.
[2:03:49] Are we together?
[2:03:56] You love the Lord.
[2:04:00] Hallelujah.
[2:04:04] What a wonderful Jesus we serve. Yes.
[2:04:06] Amen.
[2:04:12] What a beautiful God we
[2:04:25] serve. Look at Genesis
[2:04:29] 4:7. Look at Genesis
[2:04:33] 4:7. Verse 6. The Bible says, "And the
[2:04:36] Lord said unto king, why art thou
[2:04:40] wroth, and why is thy countenance
[2:04:43] fallen?" Verse seven, "If thou dost
[2:04:47] well, shall thou not be
[2:04:50] accepted? And if and if thou dost not
[2:04:54] well, sin Larth at the
[2:04:58] door, and unto thee shall be his
[2:05:07] desire. Praise the Lord. Sin Larth unto
[2:05:11] your door, but unto you sin will always
[2:05:15] chase you. Jesus told Peter,
[2:05:20] "Satan want to consume you, but I pray
[2:05:23] for
[2:05:23] you." So God is telling, "King right
[2:05:26] here,
[2:05:28] sin is desiring you.
[2:05:32] It's running after you. It's every word
[2:05:34] is there to trap
[2:05:37] you. And thou shalt rule over him."
[2:05:40] Ruled again. That's that's what I want
[2:05:42] to I want to underline there. But as we
[2:05:44] look at that
[2:05:46] together, as we look at that, this is a
[2:05:48] promise, you know, because that's that's
[2:05:50] where most of the time we struggle.
[2:05:53] That's where we think uh the authority
[2:05:55] is. The desire will be to your husband
[2:05:59] and he shall rule over thee. Let's see
[2:06:02] how how the apostle Paul took took took
[2:06:05] this scripture over in uh uh Ephesians
[2:06:08] chapter
[2:06:11] 5. Ephesians chapter 5.
[2:06:24] Are we all okay this morning or this
[2:06:27] afternoon already? Ephesians chapter 5.
[2:06:30] So let's let's take this and look at it
[2:06:33] together and see what uh uh the Apostle
[2:06:36] Paul says here.
[2:06:40] Now he's taking what Paul is saying and
[2:06:43] he's he's he's he's sticking that
[2:06:48] here and and and Paul will start the
[2:06:52] whole thing this way and he will says
[2:06:55] submitting yourself one to another in
[2:06:58] the fear of the in the fear of God. You
[2:07:00] know what is he establishing here? He
[2:07:02] establishing hairship.
[2:07:05] He establishing equality.
[2:07:12] submitting yourself one to another in
[2:07:15] the fear of the
[2:07:16] Lord. He's he's establishing
[2:07:20] equality, but yet he's going to break
[2:07:23] down our
[2:07:27] road that can only be
[2:07:31] performed if we respect our headship
[2:07:34] which is Christ. Amen.
[2:07:38] Are we together? So he says here,
[2:07:41] "Submitting yourself one to another in
[2:07:43] the fear of the Lord, wife, submit
[2:07:46] yourself unto your husband."
[2:07:49] It does not erase what he have just
[2:07:53] said. It does not erase the fact that
[2:07:56] it's only the woman that submit. No, no,
[2:07:58] no. He established it and said, "Submit
[2:08:01] yourself one to another." Amen. Be a
[2:08:04] servant one unto another. Amen.
[2:08:10] Are we together? Amen.
[2:08:13] Wife, submit yourself unto your husband
[2:08:16] as unto the Lord. Husband uh for the
[2:08:19] husband is the head of the wife even as
[2:08:20] Christ is the head of the church and he
[2:08:23] is the savior of the body. So he goes
[2:08:26] on. Now this this is where the ruler
[2:08:28] part is. Now uh verse 25, husband, love
[2:08:32] your wife even as Christ the man shall
[2:08:35] rule his wife. Paul takes that. He
[2:08:38] didn't say husband rule your wife.
[2:08:42] You say husband love your wife.
[2:08:49] Are we together? Amen.
[2:08:52] Because if you take the word, you take
[2:08:54] the com the the the the sense of the
[2:08:57] word
[2:09:01] rude, it means to it means it's it's a
[2:09:05] place of of dominance, a place of
[2:09:07] control.
[2:09:10] And that's that's not that's not God's
[2:09:12] intent.
[2:09:16] Praise the Lord.
[2:09:21] Are you seeing the picture
[2:09:24] now? Remember now, it is not just it is
[2:09:27] not just the
[2:09:29] gender woman.
[2:09:33] That's that's not what that's not what
[2:09:35] I'm in at this morning. I'm talking
[2:09:37] about the place of the woman.
[2:09:44] If we can find that
[2:09:46] place and the church can understand it.
[2:09:50] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:09:54] Not just the the the the female as as in
[2:09:57] gender.
[2:10:01] No. It's a beautiful
[2:10:04] place. It's a place where he have he
[2:10:08] have he have taken us as vessel. He took
[2:10:11] us from from from from the dustpin. He
[2:10:14] took us from all places of life. He
[2:10:16] watch us like Paul will says there
[2:10:19] sanctify your vessel. He sanctify he
[2:10:21] cleans our vessel now because he want to
[2:10:26] put this treasure of his life
[2:10:30] in us that we can say it's no longer I
[2:10:33] that live it but Christ that live.
[2:10:36] Praise the Lord. Amen. That our life can
[2:10:39] can can can create such a you know a a
[2:10:43] smell and and give people such a thirst
[2:10:47] and a longing for God. Amen. Amen.
[2:10:51] The church has practiced all the rules.
[2:10:54] The church has pract all the doctrine.
[2:10:57] But yet we are still failing at it
[2:10:59] because we have not understand our
[2:11:01] place. What the brother Bam says the
[2:11:03] rapture will go. When the church find
[2:11:06] its place
[2:11:08] when she find her position the rapture
[2:11:11] will go. Why? Because your position is
[2:11:15] your power. Amen.
[2:11:18] It's your power. That's right. Praise
[2:11:21] the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:25] But the the President Donald Trump, he
[2:11:27] can that his position is his power.
[2:11:32] If he was stay I mean uh uh uh uh you
[2:11:35] know running Hollywood show he won't
[2:11:37] have such a power. His position as a
[2:11:39] president gives him the power. That's
[2:11:40] right. So your position as a son of God
[2:11:43] and as a daughter of God knowing your
[2:11:46] position. Yeah. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:11:48] Amen. Amen. Amen. That's where your
[2:11:52] power is now. So you see that let's
[2:11:54] let's look at another thing here.
[2:11:56] Philippians chapter 2. Philippians
[2:11:58] chapter 2.
[2:12:01] Paul bring it in a very beautiful way
[2:12:03] here and I
[2:12:05] think it will help us to understand this
[2:12:08] a little bit.
[2:12:10] You love the Lord. Philippians chapter
[2:12:21] 2. Paul will says here verse one, "If
[2:12:25] there be therefore any consolation in
[2:12:28] Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
[2:12:32] fellowship of the spirit, if any bounce
[2:12:35] and mercy, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be
[2:12:38] likeminded, having the same love, being
[2:12:42] of one accord and of one mind.
[2:12:47] Let nothing be done through strife and
[2:12:50] vain glory, but in the loneliness of
[2:12:53] mind, let each esteem the other better
[2:12:58] than himself.
[2:13:00] Are we together? Amen. Let's go ahead.
[2:13:03] Uh uh uh uh. Look, not every man his his
[2:13:09] own thing, but every man also the things
[2:13:13] of other. We have to know we all are
[2:13:15] born with a selfish nature. The human
[2:13:18] nature is selfish. And until you are
[2:13:22] born again, you will be selfish.
[2:13:26] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:13:29] You'll be
[2:13:31] selfish. Now, so let's look at this
[2:13:34] together. That's not where I want to
[2:13:35] bring you though. Let this mind be in
[2:13:38] you which also which was also in Christ
[2:13:42] Jesus who being in a form of God taught
[2:13:46] a narrate to be equal with God. That is
[2:13:50] the mystery of the
[2:13:53] Godhead. Why? That's the reason why
[2:13:56] Jesus can say I am my father.
[2:14:00] But yet he can say father not my will
[2:14:04] but your will be done. Amen. Amen. Why?
[2:14:08] Because there is a there is a there is a
[2:14:11] equality
[2:14:12] here. But that equality is on a hesit.
[2:14:15] Yes.
[2:14:17] Praise the Lord. I and my father are
[2:14:20] one. Well, if we are one, why do I need
[2:14:22] his will?
[2:14:25] But yet he can submit himself.
[2:14:30] You see, and just that union between the
[2:14:33] father and the son that has been
[2:14:35] misunderstood that give us what the
[2:14:38] church called trinity.
[2:14:40] Praise the Lord. Is that same union
[2:14:43] that's supposed to be existing between
[2:14:46] the man and the woman. Equality but on a
[2:14:50] headship.
[2:14:53] That's why Paul will say in Corinthian,
[2:14:55] "Let a man knows that the head of every
[2:14:58] man is Christ
[2:15:01] and the head of the woman is the man."
[2:15:04] That's why he said that. So there is an
[2:15:07] equality,
[2:15:10] but it's on a headship. Yes. The pastor
[2:15:14] in the church, nobody make him the boss.
[2:15:17] Who make me your boss?
[2:15:20] All the church, you have a right to fire
[2:15:21] me.
[2:15:23] Go meet the deacons.
[2:15:26] Praise the Lord. Go meet the deacons.
[2:15:28] Call the officers to say, "Look, we
[2:15:30] don't like this guy." Praise the Lord.
[2:15:33] Oh, we I mean, he's too slow.
[2:15:37] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:40] So, who who make who make the pastor uh
[2:15:44] uh uh uh uh that that gives him all of
[2:15:47] the power
[2:15:50] It's never supposed to be like that. And
[2:15:53] it's not like that. It's not like that
[2:15:55] in the word. It's not like that in the
[2:15:57] message. It's not like that. It's not
[2:15:59] supposed to be like that.
[2:16:01] Now you will realize that you look in
[2:16:04] the church ages, there were two dominant
[2:16:06] spirit. The Nickelian spirit
[2:16:10] and Jezebel
[2:16:12] spirit. Those were the two dominant
[2:16:14] spirit in the church ages. And the
[2:16:17] Nicolatian spirit was the spirit that
[2:16:19] put all the power in the
[2:16:22] hierarchy in the
[2:16:24] bishops and men were ruling the church
[2:16:28] whether is by the word or not. That's
[2:16:30] what I said and that's the way it's
[2:16:32] going to be. You see that is the reason
[2:16:35] why the Catholic Church turned the Bible
[2:16:38] to be the history of their church and
[2:16:41] the pope the authority in the
[2:16:44] man the pope the priest the bishop the
[2:16:48] Bible is just the history of the church
[2:16:51] that's what you can read about how the
[2:16:53] church begin no the word has the
[2:16:56] authority
[2:17:01] are we together amen Amen. Amen.
[2:17:06] There must be there must there must be
[2:17:08] and there is an
[2:17:11] equality. I pray for you, you pray for
[2:17:14] me. Praise the
[2:17:18] Lord. There is an
[2:17:20] equality. But yet honor that equality of
[2:17:23] as we come on a hairship, our hairship
[2:17:26] define our roles. Amen.
[2:17:29] Amen.
[2:17:31] Our hairship define is the hairship
[2:17:35] Christ the word that gives me the role
[2:17:38] of being the shepherd. Amen. And it
[2:17:40] tells me what I must do as the shepherd.
[2:17:43] Amen. And the Christ the word gives you
[2:17:46] your role as a congregant and tell you
[2:17:50] your responsibility as a congregate.
[2:17:54] It does not make one person inferior and
[2:17:57] make another person superior. No.
[2:18:05] Are we together?
[2:18:12] Oh yeah. I mean I mean that's that's the
[2:18:14] bishop the pastor say let's I mean let's
[2:18:16] let's just do that. If it is not the
[2:18:18] word if it is not the word if your
[2:18:21] conscience is telling you it's not the
[2:18:22] word come and talk to him. You're
[2:18:25] reading something different in the
[2:18:26] scripture. Bring it. Let's look at it.
[2:18:33] Are we together? Let me just let me just
[2:18:34] go through this because right now I'm in
[2:18:38] a place where I can keep you here for
[2:18:39] the rest of the
[2:18:41] day. I can keep you here for the rest of
[2:18:44] the
[2:18:45] day. And you will not be bored. I
[2:18:48] promise you by the help of the Holy
[2:18:50] Spirit, you will not be bored. Amen.
[2:18:52] Because we will just have a good time.
[2:18:55] It's just that you will be so
[2:18:57] hungry. You miss your mother's
[2:19:01] meal. Are we together? Okay. So, let me
[2:19:05] just let me just lay out some few things
[2:19:06] here and then I'll leave you. Let's
[2:19:08] let's uh let's just look at something
[2:19:11] here. Look, look at this. Look at this.
[2:19:14] Choosing of a bride. Take this uh take
[2:19:16] this note in. Choosing of a bride. He
[2:19:17] says uh but if she can hold herself
[2:19:21] right, it's the woman. If she can hold
[2:19:23] herself right, what a great reward she
[2:19:27] has. Then
[2:19:31] man, if she can hold herself
[2:19:34] right, you know when a woman marry, why
[2:19:37] they call her mistress? It because she's
[2:19:41] a mystery.
[2:19:45] Amen.
[2:19:46] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:19:49] This is a mistress Jun because she's a
[2:19:51] mystery. Okay, let's let's just stay
[2:19:53] right
[2:19:55] here. But if she can hold herself right,
[2:20:00] society had just put us to this place of
[2:20:02] lot of
[2:20:05] struggle and it have misplaced
[2:20:09] us. Praise the Lord. Amen. I read this
[2:20:14] read this to you quickly and then we
[2:20:16] will we will uh we will let you go. If
[2:20:20] she can hold herself right, what a great
[2:20:22] reward she has than man. She's put on a
[2:20:28] testing
[2:20:29] ground.
[2:20:32] Through her comes death. She's guilty of
[2:20:36] all death. But then God turned
[2:20:39] around and use one to bring life back
[2:20:44] again. Brought his son through a woman,
[2:20:48] an obedient one.
[2:20:50] Do you see there?
[2:20:53] Praise the Lord. You see, you see such a
[2:20:56] place. Such a
[2:20:59] place. You read Jeremiah. Jeremiah will
[2:21:02] says, "A woman is like a compass around
[2:21:05] a man. She's like a fortress."
[2:21:09] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. She's like
[2:21:13] a fortress. the way she's
[2:21:16] built, the inner ability that is given
[2:21:19] to her to be able to carry the child in
[2:21:21] her womb for nine
[2:21:24] months. And she's I mean, it's not like
[2:21:27] uh you know uh uh uh honey, I'm I'm I'm
[2:21:30] pregnant. Oh yeah, let's let's let's
[2:21:32] make the bed. Order of this diamond,
[2:21:34] you're going to be in bed. You know,
[2:21:37] she's in bed, the pillow there. You
[2:21:40] know, she's bringing No, she's carrying
[2:21:43] life. She's taking care of the house.
[2:21:46] She's doing what she's supposed to do as
[2:21:47] a wife, as a mother. She's designed that
[2:21:51] way. Are we together? Amen.
[2:21:56] I'm showing us the position of the
[2:21:59] church.
[2:22:01] If you stick the picture of just the
[2:22:04] woman in your mind, you get out of here
[2:22:07] being angry at me. And that your own
[2:22:08] fault.
[2:22:11] That your own fault. I'm telling you
[2:22:13] now. Your own fault because you are not
[2:22:15] hearing
[2:22:21] me. Marriage and divorce. Let's take
[2:22:24] this now. Sister, I want to put you to a
[2:22:27] place where God will promise you.
[2:22:33] And you see then you stay in that place
[2:22:37] too. Notice now the woman has got her
[2:22:41] place and she is a
[2:22:44] jewer. Amen. See, she's a
[2:22:49] jewel in her place.
[2:22:53] just realizing who she is. All of this
[2:22:57] competition what what men can do, women
[2:22:59] can do, what women can do, men can do.
[2:23:02] It's just we have just we have filled
[2:23:05] ourself with lot of society garbage.
[2:23:11] Praise the Lord.
[2:23:13] It have destroyed the cord of marriage.
[2:23:16] It have destroyed the cord of family.
[2:23:25] Because when God made
[2:23:27] us, he gave each and every one of us
[2:23:31] something unique that you have that I
[2:23:35] don't have.
[2:23:40] You can admire me standing here
[2:23:41] preaching and talking. But what you
[2:23:43] have, if you get in your role, I will
[2:23:46] sit there and I will admire you.
[2:24:00] Wow. That's the way he balance the
[2:24:08] universe. And we don't we don't we don't
[2:24:11] go to the maker to be able to
[2:24:14] find that treasure that he put in our
[2:24:17] life. And that's where now envy and
[2:24:20] jealousy Joseph brothers they have to
[2:24:23] sell him o over I mean sell their own
[2:24:26] brother. What did he
[2:24:29] do? What did that little boy 17 years
[2:24:32] old what did he do to those guys just to
[2:24:35] wake up in the morning and tell them I
[2:24:36] had a
[2:24:41] dream? The very dream that was about
[2:24:44] their
[2:24:45] future. The very dream that was a
[2:24:48] prophecy, they got jealous. They sold
[2:24:51] him thinking that they would just they
[2:24:54] would destroy him. Let's let's kill him.
[2:24:56] Ruben said, "No, we shouldn't kill him.
[2:24:58] That's our own brother. Let's just sell
[2:25:00] him to these guys. Let he carry his
[2:25:02] drink somewhere else.
[2:25:06] Praise the Lord." Amen.
[2:25:09] Well, if they have discovered their own
[2:25:13] uniqueness
[2:25:15] or their own gift
[2:25:18] and say, "Oh, yeah. He's he's the
[2:25:19] dreamer. I'm I'm the farmer."
[2:25:23] While that guy is dreaming, I'm I'm
[2:25:24] planting seeds. He love dreaming. The
[2:25:27] way he love dreaming, I like planting
[2:25:29] seeds.
[2:25:37] Are we together? Amen.
[2:25:42] Notice I want to put the woman to to the
[2:25:45] place where God's word promise you. You
[2:25:48] see then you stay in that place too.
[2:25:51] Notice now the woman has got her place.
[2:25:54] And sister J, he says you Solomon here.
[2:25:57] He says, "And he said, a man that has
[2:26:00] found a wife has found a good thing." He
[2:26:03] said, "A good woman is a joy in his
[2:26:06] crown. That's an honor. But an
[2:26:10] unrighteous one is a water in his blood.
[2:26:15] That's his
[2:26:17] life. You see, uh, a woman, you are a
[2:26:21] Jew if you want to be a Jew. But the
[2:26:24] desire has to be in you. Praise the
[2:26:27] Lord. And that is the same thing with
[2:26:29] the church.
[2:26:32] Amen. The church is powerful. The church
[2:26:37] have so much influence. So much
[2:26:41] influence. If we can if we can just be
[2:26:44] able to understand why we come together
[2:26:47] like this.
[2:26:54] Are we together?
[2:27:02] Amen. Listen to
[2:27:05] this. You know, talking about Solomon
[2:27:08] here. I I you know I was I was thinking
[2:27:10] about this the other day and uh uh
[2:27:16] uh think about
[2:27:21] this
[2:27:23] Solomon never fought a
[2:27:26] war Israel call Solomon age the golden
[2:27:31] age he came in a time where David has
[2:27:34] fought he have conquered he has built
[2:27:37] relationship
[2:27:38] When Solomon was building the temple,
[2:27:41] all the nations around him were willing
[2:27:43] to
[2:27:45] contribute. David did all the work.
[2:27:48] But see the human mind. Solomon wanted
[2:27:52] to protect what he did not fought for.
[2:27:59] He wanted to protect it. So the way to
[2:28:02] protect it was to marry from all the
[2:28:06] nations around him.
[2:28:10] If I married their daughter, they will
[2:28:12] not fight against me. That's right.
[2:28:15] And many times that's what we are doing.
[2:28:21] We're trying to
[2:28:23] protect what we never fought for.
[2:28:33] We're trying to get more smarter.
[2:28:40] and is leading
[2:28:42] us into our form of
[2:28:50] idolatry. We're trying to build uh
[2:28:54] wealth. We're trying to
[2:28:56] build God has already promised to bless
[2:28:59] your path
[2:29:02] for the very fact that he have called
[2:29:04] you to a place
[2:29:06] to acknowledge
[2:29:08] him as the creator of heaven and
[2:29:20] earth. We're trying to protect
[2:29:23] it. We need to provide for our family.
[2:29:26] That's That's
[2:29:28] truth. That's truth. But who gave you
[2:29:30] the family?
[2:29:34] Who gave you the family?
[2:29:41] I want you to understand the balance of
[2:29:43] where I'm going. Now
[2:29:53] I want you to understand the balance of
[2:29:54] way of going because uh uh uh uh
[2:29:57] sometimes some people don't understand
[2:29:58] it. the they think that you are trying
[2:30:01] to make a church member or a religion
[2:30:04] out of
[2:30:08] them. But if we understand that all
[2:30:11] these things that we have, he freely
[2:30:14] place it in our hands, we were committed
[2:30:17] to him every day, our devotion to him
[2:30:21] will be more than to what we gave
[2:30:24] devotion to.
[2:30:28] our commitment to him because he gave it
[2:30:31] to us and it is only by him they can be
[2:30:43] sustained. He went into
[2:30:47] idolatry. Let's read this. led by the
[2:30:49] spirit and you see so you see women
[2:30:54] sometimes will catch it now you have to
[2:30:59] watch this but anyhow
[2:31:04] women is real acceptable to the
[2:31:09] spirit and then the
[2:31:11] gospel should keep the woman lined up
[2:31:15] and in her
[2:31:17] place. Praise the Lord.
[2:31:21] Amen. Let take a sense of this morning.
[2:31:23] You found out that there's more women in
[2:31:25] church than
[2:31:26] men. That's
[2:31:30] right. Not only this church,
[2:31:35] everywhere. It's a universal sensor,
[2:31:38] right? There is more women in church
[2:31:41] churches than men.
[2:31:45] I try to think that's the reason why in
[2:31:47] the Bible they count the men than the
[2:31:48] women because the women will outpass
[2:31:50] them.
[2:31:53] You're right.
[2:31:57] Praise the Lord. We have this thing in
[2:31:59] our generation. Alpha man. I don't like
[2:32:01] to hear that word when people says I'm
[2:32:04] an alpha man. I don't know what you're
[2:32:05] talking about. It's not scriptural to
[2:32:07] me. So let me not go in that direction
[2:32:10] because uh you know I will bring my
[2:32:12] righteous
[2:32:14] indignation. Let me just leave it like
[2:32:17] that. You have to understand that's her
[2:32:21] place. The God of the universe shut the
[2:32:25] universe
[2:32:26] down. Darkness upon the
[2:32:28] earth to form this
[2:32:32] woman. That's her place. If she can own
[2:32:36] it, find it and stay
[2:32:45] there if she can find it and stay
[2:32:53] there. And that's the same thing with
[2:32:55] the church. If the church can find their
[2:32:58] place
[2:33:03] instead they commit themselves to the
[2:33:05] word. Man shall not live by bread alone
[2:33:08] but by every word of God. Amen.
[2:33:24] We're trying to
[2:33:25] protect what was freely given to us.
[2:33:38] She catches somehow real women are is
[2:33:44] real acceptable to the spirit. And then
[2:33:47] the
[2:33:48] gospel should should keep them lined up
[2:33:51] in in and in her
[2:33:54] place. See? So then but she's more
[2:33:59] receptive to the spirit many times than
[2:34:03] men are.
[2:34:16] Are we together?
[2:34:20] If you ever been in a church where gifts
[2:34:23] operate, where gifts operate? Speaking
[2:34:26] in tongues, interpretation of tongues,
[2:34:28] prophecy. If you ever been in a church
[2:34:30] where gift operate, I don't talking
[2:34:32] about where give impersonate. I mean
[2:34:34] where give operate. Amen.
[2:34:39] You find that many times
[2:34:44] is
[2:34:46] winning that I use honor the
[2:34:57] spirit. If she can find her place and
[2:35:00] stay
[2:35:09] there. Are we together? It's almost
[2:35:13] 1:30. I mean 4 minutes to close the
[2:35:17] service at
[2:35:18] 1:30. If I don't manage the four
[2:35:20] minutes,
[2:35:23] are we together? You love the Lord.
[2:35:26] Amen.
[2:35:28] Did I took all the air out of your tire
[2:35:30] this morning?
[2:35:32] Praise the Lord. Amen. I hope I've said
[2:35:35] something to be a blessing to you.
[2:35:44] Let's take this one exposition of the
[2:35:46] church ages. I will close right here and
[2:35:48] then if the Lord allow it, we'll pick it
[2:35:51] up again.
[2:35:53] I realize there are lot of subjects I
[2:35:55] don't I don't have the time to come back
[2:35:57] to but I I pray that if the Lord allow
[2:36:00] we'll be able to pick it up
[2:36:03] again. That's for seven church. Let us
[2:36:06] go back to the beginning in the original
[2:36:09] physical creation as we as we know it
[2:36:11] today. God made everything in pairs male
[2:36:14] and female.
[2:36:16] and and and there's two two chicken
[2:36:19] rooster and hen and two cows and cow and
[2:36:22] a boat all right down the line but when
[2:36:26] it came to man there was only one praise
[2:36:30] the Lord the Bible says Genesis 1:26 God
[2:36:34] made man in his image male and female
[2:36:39] without the female part the image of God
[2:36:42] is not complete praise the Lord
[2:36:46] And that's the reason why many of the
[2:36:47] time you find you find single men and
[2:36:50] single women they get so so zillious to
[2:36:54] serve the Lord. They are on fire serving
[2:36:56] the Lord. As soon as they get married it
[2:36:58] looks like oh I used to pray but this
[2:37:00] woman is not the woman. It's now that
[2:37:03] you come into balance.
[2:37:05] [Music]
[2:37:06] It's now that you come into balance.
[2:37:09] Why? Because now you have this feminine
[2:37:12] part that is making a full
[2:37:15] image and we don't see that and we start
[2:37:18] to make one another our
[2:37:20] problem. Notice that it's not he's not
[2:37:22] the problem, she's not the problem. It's
[2:37:26] just that we not understanding what is
[2:37:27] happening.
[2:37:36] Are we together?
[2:37:42] Jesus would tell the woman that the
[2:37:44] word God is a
[2:37:47] spirit. Genesis 1:26, that's what he was
[2:37:50] quoting. And they that worship him must
[2:37:53] worship him in spirit and in
[2:37:58] truth. The word is the male part. The
[2:38:02] spirit that brings the gift upon the
[2:38:04] church.
[2:38:06] That's the female
[2:38:11] part. That is the
[2:38:14] balance. That's the
[2:38:26] balance. There is no male dominance here
[2:38:30] in the economy of God. No, God don't
[2:38:32] even dominate. He He don't even dominate
[2:38:35] his people. He don't rule us. No, he
[2:38:39] love us.
[2:38:42] God don't rule us. You ever wake up in
[2:38:44] the morning, you get whipped all on your
[2:38:46] back.
[2:38:49] Say because what were you yesterday? I
[2:38:51] whip you when you are sleeping.
[2:38:58] He work with us in love to be able to
[2:39:01] bring us to a place of understanding.
[2:39:05] understanding his purpose, what he what
[2:39:08] he's trying to achieve in the moment,
[2:39:11] what he's doing in your life. It might
[2:39:13] look like a chaos, but he said, "I have
[2:39:15] a plan." Hold on a little bit. Amen.
[2:39:28] But our attention span is so
[2:39:31] short.
[2:39:34] Our patient elastic quick to
[2:39:41] break quick to
[2:39:47] break. Can we trust he that have begun
[2:39:49] this good work in us? Can we trust that
[2:39:53] he has a purpose is going to fulfill it?
[2:39:58] Are we together? Amen.
[2:40:10] One try to pick you up if the Lord allow
[2:40:14] us
[2:40:18] to. So are you seeing the
[2:40:21] picture? Paul said we have this
[2:40:25] treasure in effing vessel.
[2:40:32] He says, "Possess your treasure in
[2:40:38] sanctification." That's the picture of
[2:40:40] Joseph being a just
[2:40:45] man. Well, he never understood what Mary
[2:40:48] said. An angel spoke to me. The angel
[2:40:50] said, "I will have a child." He never
[2:40:52] went posting her on Facebook and
[2:40:54] blasting her everywhere.
[2:40:56] No, he said, "I don't understand this. I
[2:40:59] don't understand. It's strange. I love
[2:41:01] this guy. I don't understand
[2:41:04] it." Instead of making a public disgrace
[2:41:07] of her, I would just step back
[2:41:10] quietly. God said, "No, Joseph, you are
[2:41:12] the man." The same angel woke him up and
[2:41:15] say, "You are the you I choose you for
[2:41:17] this job."
[2:41:25] Why? Because she was carrying a
[2:41:26] treasure. This young innocent uh h girl,
[2:41:31] she was say there in her in her teenage
[2:41:33] around 18 uh 20 or whatever the age was,
[2:41:36] but she was
[2:41:39] young. The whole religious world will be
[2:41:42] going against her because they have
[2:41:43] never heard anything like that. All her
[2:41:45] friends will reject her because her name
[2:41:48] will now become a bad
[2:41:50] word. Hey you come come sir come sir
[2:41:52] before you can tell me say angel v
[2:41:57] you all the parents now will be talking
[2:41:59] to their
[2:42:01] children. What was happening as a
[2:42:03] glorious thing is now becoming a bad
[2:42:06] word in the mouth of the people. But God
[2:42:08] needed a man that would stand there.
[2:42:11] God needed a man that will be close and
[2:42:14] will support her. That's why your
[2:42:16] marriage vow said in good health in
[2:42:19] suffering. That's that's what that's
[2:42:21] what is there in the marriage coing.
[2:42:32] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:42:37] A man and a woman can stay in the
[2:42:40] house the whole week and don't go
[2:42:42] anywhere.
[2:42:44] The man can be in his he can be in his
[2:42:46] you know uh clothes track clothes
[2:42:49] whatever it is
[2:42:50] simple before that week end the letter
[2:42:54] will have to change maybe
[2:42:57] twice well we are not going anywhere
[2:43:00] that why are you changing your clothes I
[2:43:02] don't want to just wear this one thing
[2:43:04] the whole
[2:43:07] week that's that's her
[2:43:10] makeup that's her makeup she love
[2:43:13] changing
[2:43:15] It's it's her makeup. She can't help
[2:43:17] herself. She put the hair this way. This
[2:43:20] next we find out it will be on the other
[2:43:21] side.
[2:43:25] Praise the Lord.
[2:43:28] The man, the Bible knows his haircut.
[2:43:30] Every time he comes, the same thing.
[2:43:33] Every time he comes, the same. Not the
[2:43:35] woman. Not the woman. No, no, no, no. I
[2:43:38] I did my hair like that the past two
[2:43:40] weeks. I want something different.
[2:43:42] That's her makeup.
[2:43:46] That's her makeup.
[2:43:51] I heard this guy that says uh you know
[2:43:53] the his the the the woman told him, you
[2:43:56] know, uh uh uh she
[2:43:59] said, you know, just I mean just just a
[2:44:02] simple, you know, uh uh uh you know,
[2:44:05] yeah, I'm happy I'll be with you. I'm
[2:44:08] simple. I take anything, you know, very
[2:44:12] simple. He says, "Okay." I mean, after
[2:44:16] the little while they got marriage, he
[2:44:18] realized she says, "Uh, you know, uh uh
[2:44:23] we've been having this cush for for the
[2:44:25] past year now. Let's change it." He
[2:44:27] said, "Well, I told you from the
[2:44:29] beginning you told me
[2:44:32] that praise the Lord, she's she's not
[2:44:35] being evil.
[2:44:37] She's just breaking it out. If you
[2:44:39] cannot buy a new one, you know what you
[2:44:41] do? Just change it around. Change the
[2:44:44] living room. Just just make a change.
[2:44:47] She love it.
[2:44:49] That's That's the way she
[2:44:56] is. That's the mystery of woman.
[2:45:01] Praise the Lord.
[2:45:07] Happy Mother's Day.
[2:45:14] [Applause]
[2:45:19] We will never understand the things that
[2:45:21] our mother goes
[2:45:23] through. We never understand the thing
[2:45:26] that our mother goes through. And like I
[2:45:28] always
[2:45:29] say, there's no way you can love your
[2:45:31] mother and disrespect your wife.
[2:45:34] Tell it again. No, there's no way you
[2:45:38] can respect your mother, love your
[2:45:40] mother, and disrespect your
[2:45:43] wife. Look at that area, her lifegiving
[2:45:51] abilities. Look at that area, her
[2:45:53] lifegiving abilities. And and in every
[2:45:56] relationship is just like that. It's
[2:45:58] it's in both
[2:46:00] ways. It's in very both ways.
[2:46:03] Uh uh sometimes young women that really
[2:46:08] did not have good uh relationship with
[2:46:11] their father
[2:46:13] struggle with their husband. Sometimes I
[2:46:16] remember now I say sometimes I'm not
[2:46:19] making an online statement here.
[2:46:22] Sometimes it's it's in both
[2:46:26] ways. I was at a youth meeting many
[2:46:30] years ago. My wife was over in the
[2:46:32] states even at that time and uh uh you
[2:46:35] know uh and his young brother came to me
[2:46:38] and you know
[2:46:40] he you know I was I was at that time I
[2:46:43] was much smaller than what I am and he
[2:46:45] he just thought I was I was his age
[2:46:49] mate. He says oh wow you are married. I
[2:46:53] say yes. He says you have a child. I
[2:46:56] said
[2:46:57] yeah. How old she? I I could just tell
[2:47:00] his age. I said, "She's she she as older
[2:47:03] like you." Said, "No, you joking. You're
[2:47:06] joking. What's your age that you have a
[2:47:08] child like me?" You know, I told him my
[2:47:12] age. He said, "Oh, I didn't know you
[2:47:13] were that older. You you mean you really
[2:47:15] have a child like like
[2:47:18] me?" So, I told him, I says, "No,
[2:47:21] uh uh you know, I told him, my sister, I
[2:47:24] having one daughter. He says, "Uh,
[2:47:28] uh, really? You really mean that?" I
[2:47:30] says, "No, I'm just joking you. Uh,
[2:47:32] that's my wife." He says, "Oh, wow. I
[2:47:35] never heard it like that." You know, and
[2:47:37] I and I think and I think it's some of
[2:47:40] the things that the way that God
[2:47:43] designed it, the way he placed us in the
[2:47:46] life of one another, you know, the very
[2:47:49] same thing will go the other
[2:47:53] way. If a girl love and respect her
[2:47:56] father, she will do do the same thing to
[2:47:59] her
[2:48:00] husband. It's a thing that we have to
[2:48:02] battle. We have to strive. We have to we
[2:48:05] have to have God to help
[2:48:09] us. Our human nature, our self-centered,
[2:48:15] selfish nature and some of the things
[2:48:18] that the society has breathed in
[2:48:21] us make us to struggle with this.
[2:48:26] and make us to struggle. But there is a
[2:48:28] beautiful
[2:48:29] place. There is a beautiful place. If
[2:48:33] the church can just find that place.
[2:48:40] If the church can just find her
[2:48:51] place when the Holy Ghost came and the
[2:48:54] church was
[2:48:55] birthed, man, all of those guys,
[2:48:58] everybody wanted to they wanted to be
[2:49:00] involved in the in in in the saving of
[2:49:05] souls. They wanted to tell somebody
[2:49:07] about the gospel. They wanted they
[2:49:09] wanted to give
[2:49:12] birth. That's the desire of every young
[2:49:15] woman that gets married. She wants to
[2:49:17] give
[2:49:23] birth. They wanted to lead somebody to
[2:49:25] the kingdom. They wanted to to to to
[2:49:28] affect somebody's life.
[2:49:36] They were having their personal Bible
[2:49:38] studies, you know, trying to talk to
[2:49:40] this friend and use their own testimony.
[2:49:43] What God brought me through, you know,
[2:49:44] the Lord has been good to me and all of
[2:49:58] that. Persecution came on the church.
[2:50:00] The people were dispersed.
[2:50:04] And the very reason why God put them in
[2:50:06] that condition was for the gospel to
[2:50:08] spread around the world. And pretty soon
[2:50:11] the church started coming to the place
[2:50:13] of
[2:50:17] complacency. When the Roman church came
[2:50:19] in and Rome became part of the church,
[2:50:22] they started building a nice
[2:50:25] building. Pretty soon the common people
[2:50:27] started feeling
[2:50:28] condemned to go because it was all a
[2:50:31] dressing of class.
[2:50:36] The spirit of God, it was no, it was no
[2:50:38] longer about the word. It was no longer
[2:50:40] about praying for this person. It was
[2:50:42] just it all turned to the dressing of
[2:50:48] class. You saw what Cifus and his wife
[2:50:51] brought to church today. We got to beat
[2:50:54] them this week.
[2:50:56] We got to beat them next
[2:50:59] week. I would just star at her from up
[2:51:02] and
[2:51:03] down. What is
[2:51:07] that? What is that?
[2:51:12] And pretty
[2:51:15] soon the humble, faithful, dedicated
[2:51:18] believers that were coming, they were
[2:51:21] kept in the
[2:51:25] back. This prestigious people were in
[2:51:28] the
[2:51:33] front. When Paul wrote the letter to
[2:51:37] Rome that we call the book of Rome, uh
[2:51:40] the book of Romans, when he wrote it to
[2:51:42] to Rome,
[2:51:45] uh
[2:51:46] uh uh the Roman church has already took
[2:51:50] over. So Paul was sending that letter to
[2:51:53] the few believers that were
[2:51:55] gathering. So there were two church in
[2:51:58] Rome at that
[2:52:02] time. a few despised
[2:52:07] believers that could no longer stand
[2:52:09] with the rapid change that was taking
[2:52:11] place in the church. Rapid change. The
[2:52:14] church was growing. Started becoming a
[2:52:16] mega
[2:52:19] church because it was all about
[2:52:28] class. Musicians you can come.
[2:52:32] Thank you for bearing with me. I know
[2:52:34] many of you have uh some uh something
[2:52:36] special you wanted to do for Mother's
[2:52:39] Day, but I also have this on my heart
[2:52:42] special that I wanted to share with you
[2:52:45] and uh uh uh just
[2:52:50] uh realizing the
[2:52:52] comparison realizing uh uh the the the
[2:52:56] time that we are living in why the
[2:52:58] church is not becoming effective. Why
[2:53:01] are we not effective? Why are we now up
[2:53:04] and
[2:53:06] doing? Because we have missed our
[2:53:11] place. It is all becoming
[2:53:16] competition. We want to get more than
[2:53:18] this other person. We want to be better
[2:53:19] than this other person. It's just all we
[2:53:21] we are missing our purpose.
[2:53:38] Now, I was thinking thinking during the
[2:53:40] week, I was saying to myself, I was
[2:53:42] saying there this uh young man that came
[2:53:44] uh uh uh
[2:53:46] the last week and wanted to to be
[2:53:49] baptized. I was just saying to myself, I
[2:53:51] say, "Sir, if that if that would just
[2:53:55] be why we stay on this street corner all
[2:53:58] of these
[2:54:05] years and with all that we we we want to
[2:54:08] think about with everything that we want
[2:54:09] to think
[2:54:11] about that we want as a
[2:54:14] [Music]
[2:54:16] church, we have to realize that we are
[2:54:19] here for a
[2:54:21] purpose. He placed us to this place for
[2:54:23] a
[2:54:24] [Music]
[2:54:31] [Music]
[2:54:39] purpose. Let's bow our heads together
[2:54:42] now.
[2:54:46] [Music]

[2:54:56] [Music]

[2:56:21] whether she's no longer with

[2:56:32] memories. Think about some of the things
[2:56:34] that
[2:56:36] uh she would go through. I
[2:56:40] remember texting a young man this
[2:56:43] morning. Good friend of mine, his mom
[2:56:46] passed away. We did a funeral sometime
[2:56:48] this year.
[2:56:52] And I text him amen.
[2:56:54] Now I said I told him I said let her
[2:56:57] memory live in your heart. And as he
[2:57:00] reme as you remember her think about
[2:57:03] what she's expecting of
[2:57:08] you. Because whatever she said to you,
[2:57:10] she won't say it again. But what is she
[2:57:13] expecting of you?
[2:57:16] [Music]
[2:57:21] Let's just sing it softly together while
[2:57:22] we just worship a little bit before we
[2:57:27] pray. Precious

[3:04:25] our responsibilities Lord to realize oh
[3:04:28] God father you place us there just in
[3:04:31] the way of a drama Lord God to be a
[3:04:33] protector to be a provider Lord
[3:04:36] God Father Lord to
[3:04:39] be for companionship oh
[3:04:44] God and how many we how many of us need
[3:04:47] to grow in
[3:04:48] [Music]
[3:04:50] We fuss about some of the silliest
[3:04:52] thing, Lord. Some of our insecurity, oh
[3:04:56] God, Father, our selfishness, Lord
[3:05:01] God. And many times it's the it's the
[3:05:04] lives of the children that
[3:05:06] suffer. Oh
[3:05:10] God. Oh God. If we can find that
[3:05:13] place and just stay there.
[3:05:16] We can find that place,
[3:05:19] Lord. A place of submission, oh God, to
[3:05:22] your
[3:05:25] word, a closet of
[3:05:29] [Music]
[3:05:42] praying. Church life is filling.
[3:05:48] Because we are becoming too concerned
[3:05:50] about
[3:05:51] ourself than the one that has given us
[3:05:54] the gift of
[3:05:55] [Music]
[3:05:59] life. Looking for our own personal
[3:06:02] security and living your internal
[3:06:05] security, your divine security. Oh
[3:06:09] God, may you just help us Lord. Help us
[3:06:14] Lord. Father God, it's a divine place.
[3:06:17] It's not a place. It's a place that you
[3:06:19] bring one to. It's a place that, oh God,
[3:06:21] where you bring the church to. It's a
[3:06:23] place where you bring the believers to
[3:06:25] God. We can't find it ourself. Oh God,
[3:06:28] but by submitting to you. By submitting
[3:06:32] to you, Lord, and committing ourself in
[3:06:34] your hands and asking and say, "Lord,
[3:06:36] break me out of my selfishness. Break me
[3:06:39] out of my lustfulness. break me out of
[3:06:42] every form of
[3:06:44] worldliness. Then you can bring us to
[3:06:46] that place, Lord God.
[3:06:54] [Music]
[3:07:01] [Music]
[3:07:07] What a wonderful
[3:07:09] place. It's not a It's not a It's not an
[3:07:14] inferior
[3:07:16] position. It's a place of power. It's a
[3:07:20] place of
[3:07:23] influence. When a lady can be a lady,
[3:07:28] and dress like a lady and carry herself
[3:07:30] like a lady and speak like a lady. It's
[3:07:33] a place of power. It's a place of
[3:07:36] influence.
[3:07:43] [Music]
[3:07:53] Oh
[3:07:58] father, we just want to bring ourself to
[3:08:00] you God this
[3:08:03] afternoon. And dear Lord, just like I
[3:08:05] said to the saints, oh God, I
[3:08:07] pray that Lord
[3:08:10] Father, we would not be misunderstood,
[3:08:13] Lord.
[3:08:16] is to be able to celebrate that
[3:08:18] position of a
[3:08:21] woman, that
[3:08:25] treasure, that
[3:08:27] vessel that you gave us, oh God, that is
[3:08:30] very
[3:08:32] special, very unique, very
[3:08:36] beautiful. The mother of our children
[3:08:42] [Music]
[3:08:56] Oh, how I pray, Lord God, that you will
[3:08:59] you will just soften our hearts, oh God.
[3:09:03] There are a lot of things so
[3:09:05] father that happened in our lives that
[3:09:08] we don't have control

[3:09:20] your hands Lord.

[3:09:25] special way. Come in a special way Lord
[3:09:28] Jesus. You know our need. Oh God. you
[3:09:32] know our need as a church. Lord, how I
[3:09:34] prayed, oh God, that God, you would get
[3:09:38] a hold of the hearts of the people. You
[3:09:40] would drive them, oh God, Father, into
[3:09:43] praying and into consecration, Lord. You
[3:09:46] would drive them, oh Father, Lord God,
[3:09:48] into a place, Lord
[3:09:52] Jesus, where your grace can start to
[3:09:54] blossom, oh God, in their life.
[3:10:13] [Music]
[3:10:17] That's what we need,
[3:10:19] Father. That blood that will never loses
[3:10:22] its power.
[3:10:24] God, we can trust in it, Father.
[3:10:28] Lord, we can rest in it, oh
[3:10:33] God. Oh, hallelujah,
[3:10:37] Jesus. Thank you, Father. Thank you,
[3:10:41] Lord. Thank you, Lord
[3:10:45] God. May you forgive us, Lord Jesus, of
[3:10:48] all our wrong attitude, Father God.
[3:10:52] all our disrespect Lord Father to your
[3:10:55] presence to your word. Every time you
[3:10:58] speak to our hearts, oh God, Father, all
[3:11:01] our disrespect, Lord, Father God, to all
[3:11:04] the women in our lives, our
