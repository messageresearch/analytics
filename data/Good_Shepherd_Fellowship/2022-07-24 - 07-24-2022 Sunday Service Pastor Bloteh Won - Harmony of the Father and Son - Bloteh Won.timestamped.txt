[55:23] let's drop down to verse 14.
[55:27] i write now these things to shame you

[55:32] church
[55:35] as a messenger who speak to the church
[55:38] age
[55:39] right now these things to shame you
[55:42] but
[55:43] as my beloved sons
[55:46] i warn you
[55:48] for though ye have ten thousand
[55:51] instructors in christ
[55:54] yet have ye not many fathers
[55:58] it take only one man to beget you
[56:02] praise the lord
[56:04] you may have many teachers but it take
[56:06] one man
[56:08] to beget you
[56:10] though ye have
[56:12] ten thousand instructors in christ
[56:15] yet have ye met many fathers
[56:18] for in christ jesus i have begotten you
[56:22] through the gospel
[56:25] therefore i beseech you
[56:28] be your followers of me
[56:31] amen
[56:32] let us pray heavenly father
[56:35] we want to pray and ask blessings lord
[56:37] this morning
[56:39] dear lord
[56:40] the emphasis of god is
[56:43] what the holy spirit is doing in our
[56:46] lives
[56:47] we're being told by the prophet
[56:50] that you kept a harmony between the
[56:52] father and the son
[56:53] you would do the same lord
[56:55] well god sometimes until the holy spirit
[56:59] brings us to that understanding
[57:01] precious law we might just wonder and
[57:04] wonder and wonder but i pray this
[57:06] morning that lord you will help us as we
[57:09] take this little portion of your word
[57:12] drive us in the way that god you want us
[57:14] to go this morning speak to us as only
[57:17] you can
[57:18] and father we will give you the praise
[57:20] the glory and honor
[57:22] in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord
[57:25] bless you
[57:28] i will read verse 17
[57:31] for this cause have i sent unto you
[57:34] timotheurs who is my beloved son
[57:37] and faithful in the lord we shall bring
[57:41] you in remembrance of mine of my ways
[57:44] which be in christ
[57:47] as i teach every word
[57:49] in every church praise the lord
[57:53] amen amen
[57:55] praise the lord
[57:57] i was wondering
[57:59] who is the brother singing in the front
[58:02] i never knew you were the one down there
[58:05] i saw you on fire this morning i mean
[58:08] you were just into every song and
[58:11] praise the lord
[58:12] amen
[58:14] good to see you
[58:15] amen
[58:16] amen
[58:18] praise the lord
[58:21] praise the lord
[58:24] so we want to continue where we stop
[58:27] before we left we were speaking on the
[58:29] message the harmony of the father
[58:32] and the son
[58:34] taking from the began with church age we
[58:36] want to just go over that taught again
[58:40] and
[58:42] notice the harmony of the father and the
[58:45] son
[58:46] jesus never did anything
[58:48] until it was first shown him
[58:51] by the father
[58:54] saint john
[58:56] 5 19
[58:57] jesus says i do nothing but except that
[59:00] which the father have shown me
[59:02] this harmony
[59:06] this harmony is known to exist between
[59:10] the groom and the bride
[59:12] which is christ and the church
[59:15] now you have to follow me a little bit
[59:17] because i'm really i'm really going
[59:19] somewhere with this i'm not just
[59:22] preaching i believe that
[59:25] we have that responsibility to this
[59:27] local assembly
[59:28] and
[59:30] so to be able to
[59:32] uh
[59:34] place us rightly in the world as we
[59:36] would trust the holy spirit but um i'm
[59:38] using this for us to be able to go
[59:40] somewhere
[59:41] and understand
[59:43] what we are doing as a local church
[59:47] praise the lord
[59:49] amen
[59:50] what this local church is doing we want
[59:53] to understand
[59:54] what god wants to achieve in this body
[1:00:02] i don't believe that
[1:00:05] god
[1:00:05] have just kept us here out of these
[1:00:07] years
[1:00:09] you know
[1:00:11] i mean a church where we can just come
[1:00:13] and go do as we want to
[1:00:15] and
[1:00:16] you know
[1:00:19] no
[1:00:20] i believe that a church
[1:00:23] is a family it's a body a man
[1:00:26] a group of people that go all call
[1:00:28] together
[1:00:29] from from different backgrounds and uh
[1:00:32] different family
[1:00:33] and and and create a unit among them
[1:00:36] praise the lord for a particular purpose
[1:00:39] and and that's why we want to we want to
[1:00:41] address a little bit
[1:00:43] so we pray that the lord will help us
[1:00:46] now see brother brahm talking about a
[1:00:48] harmony between the father and the son
[1:00:52] which of course he says more exists
[1:00:54] between the bride and christ so we're
[1:00:56] looking at a father and son relationship
[1:00:59] that must also exist between the bride
[1:01:03] and christ a husband and wife
[1:01:07] praise the lord
[1:01:09] amen so uh
[1:01:11] uh
[1:01:12] that's what we want to deal with so we
[1:01:13] we started we started addressing that we
[1:01:16] took a little bit of uh
[1:01:21] david
[1:01:22] and saul praise the lord
[1:01:25] we took a little bit of david and saul
[1:01:27] uh when when when saul died and david
[1:01:31] started crying and you know
[1:01:33] he he tore his clothes
[1:01:36] and started weeping and we were trying
[1:01:38] to show that how david
[1:01:41] on the inspiration he was able to see
[1:01:44] you know the gift that god raised up
[1:01:48] after the judges
[1:01:50] to be able to lead israel for a period
[1:01:52] of time
[1:01:53] praise the lord
[1:01:55] and and because david was able to
[1:01:58] identify that and he was able to rightly
[1:02:01] place himself on the death we realized
[1:02:03] that uh
[1:02:05] even though
[1:02:06] samuel anointed him to be king
[1:02:09] but he did not he did not run into the
[1:02:12] king's office
[1:02:14] because he knew that there was a man
[1:02:16] already there so uh
[1:02:19] he took all of those years
[1:02:21] took all of those years to grow into his
[1:02:24] office
[1:02:25] praise the lord
[1:02:27] we also started talking about elijah and
[1:02:30] elisha
[1:02:32] so you will see it all through the
[1:02:33] scripture
[1:02:35] it first started with god in adam
[1:02:38] the harmony between the father and the
[1:02:40] son
[1:02:41] when adam was in eating
[1:02:44] you know there was such a harmony that
[1:02:48] uh
[1:02:50] every
[1:02:51] every name that adam gave to every you
[1:02:54] know plain and animal god was so pleased
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:58] praise the lord god never came around
[1:03:00] and rearranged what adam
[1:03:02] have already arranged there was just
[1:03:04] such a harmony between the father and
[1:03:07] the son and then we realized that
[1:03:10] that was that was what the enemy target
[1:03:15] because if he can break the harmony
[1:03:18] amen
[1:03:19] in
[1:03:20] between the father and the son
[1:03:22] he can be able to to make us to wonder
[1:03:26] if he can break the harmony in the local
[1:03:28] church praise the lord
[1:03:31] and uh
[1:03:32] i mean that we can we can come together
[1:03:35] we can grow in numbers but we will be
[1:03:37] going nowhere
[1:03:40] praise the lord
[1:03:42] we will be going nowhere we will not be
[1:03:44] able to achieve anything
[1:03:46] we would just come and and dance to the
[1:03:48] music
[1:03:49] you know
[1:03:50] get a preacher in a pulpit and work him
[1:03:53] out and and i mean
[1:03:56] put him to the place where he can break
[1:03:58] sweat
[1:03:59] and then and then we go home
[1:04:02] but i mean as a unit as a body we would
[1:04:05] not be going in a word and even in our
[1:04:07] family structure if the enemy can break
[1:04:10] the harmony in the family we would just
[1:04:13] be existing
[1:04:14] you know but we will not be going
[1:04:17] anywhere as a family
[1:04:19] so
[1:04:20] that's what we want to look at this
[1:04:22] morning and you see that god
[1:04:25] has worked that way
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:29] praise the lord right after the flood
[1:04:32] god called
[1:04:33] abraham
[1:04:36] abraham brought lord and lord traveled
[1:04:38] with him in but god promised abraham
[1:04:43] a son
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:47] true womb abraham will be the father of
[1:04:50] many nations
[1:04:51] so god once again will will establish a
[1:04:55] father and son relationship
[1:04:58] not
[1:05:00] through isaac but god
[1:05:02] will allow abraham to raise up a boy in
[1:05:06] his house called eliezer
[1:05:10] a trusted seven
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:15] that abraham will commission
[1:05:19] so
[1:05:20] watch now watch the idea watch the
[1:05:22] inspiration is god raising up sons the
[1:05:26] brother branham taught in adoption
[1:05:29] that will be able to understand the
[1:05:31] heart of the father
[1:05:36] praise the lord
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:40] now not not just sons
[1:05:43] there will that will uh uh believe that
[1:05:46] they are sons and and uh uh you know uh
[1:05:50] uh
[1:05:52] won all the privilege of psalms
[1:05:55] you know uh because what what we're
[1:05:58] saying that is that is rising up in our
[1:06:00] age is entitlement
[1:06:03] spirit of entitlement
[1:06:07] i'm a son so this belongs to me because
[1:06:09] i'm a son i have a right to this
[1:06:12] and you find people you know uh uh
[1:06:16] you know trying to claim inheritance
[1:06:19] trying to claim gift trying to claim
[1:06:22] blessing become a son of god i'm a child
[1:06:24] of god i have a right to this but you
[1:06:26] you are you also realize that even if
[1:06:29] you claim it and and and and in no way
[1:06:32] you try to achieve it because you have
[1:06:36] not been tutored
[1:06:39] you have not been taught
[1:06:42] it will be just like a practical song
[1:06:45] taking the wealth of the father and and
[1:06:47] lavish in it
[1:06:51] praise the lord you will take the name
[1:06:53] of god you will make a shame of it
[1:06:56] you will take the gift of god you will
[1:06:57] make a mess out of it
[1:07:02] you will take the grace of god and bring
[1:07:03] a disgrace out of it
[1:07:09] why because you are a son that don't
[1:07:11] give your heart to be taught
[1:07:14] so you see that relationship
[1:07:17] all through the scripture
[1:07:19] when god called moses there was a son
[1:07:22] joshua
[1:07:24] that grew to understand the heart of the
[1:07:27] father
[1:07:31] and moses talked about an inheritance he
[1:07:33] talked about the land
[1:07:35] and and and and even though there were
[1:07:37] there were giants and and and and men
[1:07:40] you know of renown in the land but
[1:07:43] joshua knew the heart of moses that he
[1:07:46] had doubt said the lord and he said we
[1:07:48] are more than able
[1:07:50] to take the land
[1:07:52] the harmony between the father
[1:07:56] and the son
[1:08:00] praise the lord
[1:08:03] god do not do guesswork
[1:08:06] and he don't want his children
[1:08:08] to do guesswork
[1:08:11] praise the lord
[1:08:12] if you are well taught you don't need to
[1:08:14] guess
[1:08:15] you know exactly what to do
[1:08:17] because you are well taught
[1:08:22] praise the lord
[1:08:27] so that's what we want to look at as we
[1:08:30] as we label on a distort
[1:08:33] and
[1:08:36] praise the lord
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] so the the harmony
[1:08:42] between the father and the son
[1:08:45] amen the harmony of the father and the
[1:08:48] son
[1:08:50] where jesus never did uh anything
[1:08:54] until it was first shown to him by the
[1:08:56] father
[1:08:57] and this harmony noun to exist between
[1:09:00] the bride and christ he show her his
[1:09:03] word of
[1:09:04] life she received it
[1:09:07] she never doubted it therefore nothing
[1:09:10] can harm her
[1:09:11] not even death
[1:09:14] praise the lord
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:18] not evie death now so when you look at
[1:09:21] it between the david and saw
[1:09:23] relationship you realize that even
[1:09:25] though saul got into a compromised
[1:09:28] position
[1:09:29] and and and where now he started to deal
[1:09:32] with with an evil spirit where he goes
[1:09:35] in and out of praise the lord
[1:09:38] amen you know brother bran talks dead
[1:09:40] you know what if a man will not uh stay
[1:09:43] under the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:09:44] god would give him another spirit to
[1:09:46] lead him
[1:09:47] because we that's the way we are made we
[1:09:50] are made with sheep nature we must be
[1:09:53] led
[1:09:54] praise the lord
[1:09:56] we must be led and and we we've seen
[1:09:59] a
[1:10:00] growing number of people
[1:10:02] that have that that that is just being
[1:10:04] captured under a religious spirit you
[1:10:07] know i mean they can code the message
[1:10:09] and then and one thing it would do it
[1:10:11] would just make you arrogant because
[1:10:13] your hair will be so blow up and you
[1:10:15] think you know everything in the world
[1:10:17] and i mean you can say the prophet say
[1:10:18] that the scripture say this and
[1:10:20] and and then you go in nowhere with that
[1:10:23] praise the lord
[1:10:25] amen so we we just we just want to pray
[1:10:28] that the lord will be able to help us
[1:10:30] he will be able to teach us
[1:10:33] amen
[1:10:34] so we can order our steps amen
[1:10:37] praise the lord so we can order our
[1:10:39] steps
[1:10:41] glory be to god so as we look at this
[1:10:44] thought together let me start with
[1:10:46] something here the spoken word is the
[1:10:48] original seed
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:54] this is something that i'm not going to
[1:10:55] finish today and i don't know when i'm
[1:10:57] going to finish it
[1:11:00] so i'm not in a hurry at all
[1:11:04] praise the lord
[1:11:06] let's take a talk here and study a
[1:11:08] little bit
[1:11:09] in
[1:11:10] uh this
[1:11:12] in in this uh
[1:11:15] quote we have here oh yeah we are going
[1:11:18] to get into something deep now
[1:11:21] now watch
[1:11:22] this sea church
[1:11:24] the real church with the real sperm
[1:11:27] that's the beginning church that's the
[1:11:29] alpha church that's the pentecostal
[1:11:31] church
[1:11:32] now remember
[1:11:34] god
[1:11:36] never committed
[1:11:38] his preaching and his gospel to an angel
[1:11:42] that's right
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:45] but yet
[1:11:47] uh uh
[1:11:49] uh
[1:11:50] the the the ministers uh
[1:11:52] angels flame of fire okay that's what
[1:11:55] paul says
[1:11:57] let's follow this together now because i
[1:11:59] want us to study
[1:12:02] how many knows that how many knows that
[1:12:05] galatians 1 8 says even though an angel
[1:12:08] from heaven
[1:12:11] paul says even though an angel from
[1:12:13] heaven
[1:12:14] say anything to you that is not
[1:12:16] according to my gospel let that angel be
[1:12:19] a curse
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:23] it shows the authority
[1:12:26] that a messenger
[1:12:28] a god-called man have
[1:12:32] more than an angelic being in heaven
[1:12:38] are we together
[1:12:42] amen
[1:12:43] so he says that
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:49] knows that galatians 1 8 says if an
[1:12:52] angel comes from heaven and preached and
[1:12:54] preached something else besides
[1:12:57] they have preached that paul had
[1:12:59] preached let it be a curse
[1:13:02] so the the the angel's wrong if he
[1:13:05] doesn't if if he's different from the
[1:13:08] word that's right amen
[1:13:11] that's the reason why whether it's a
[1:13:13] dream
[1:13:14] whether it's a vision it must come back
[1:13:17] to the word of god
[1:13:18] it must be lined up with the word of god
[1:13:24] and that is the highest authoritative in
[1:13:26] the local church
[1:13:29] nothing is above the word amen
[1:13:33] it must come back to the word of god
[1:13:36] are we together
[1:13:42] god comes down below
[1:13:45] angels and committed to men
[1:13:49] praise the lord
[1:13:50] he committed to men which were sons
[1:13:55] you believe that now watch
[1:13:58] he never committed it to angels
[1:14:02] notice he did not do it
[1:14:05] now philip had been
[1:14:08] up at pentecost jerusalem to worship
[1:14:12] amen
[1:14:13] i mean he says amen to death the eunuch
[1:14:16] he have been
[1:14:18] with all the dd's in ll now what he's
[1:14:20] dealing with here is us chapter eight
[1:14:24] philip in the ethiopian unit
[1:14:27] amen
[1:14:28] now he's going to teach us a principle
[1:14:30] that's what i want us to grab as we look
[1:14:32] at this harmony
[1:14:38] but why didn't he get something he come
[1:14:41] down steadying the prophet
[1:14:44] the prophecy of isaiah
[1:14:47] although an angel directed him to philip
[1:14:52] but the dream of life had to come
[1:14:55] through the body
[1:15:00] praise the lord
[1:15:02] that is a very
[1:15:04] strong statement
[1:15:07] life only comes through the body
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:14] you cannot live a successful christian
[1:15:17] life on an island
[1:15:20] you can never be an island believer
[1:15:27] life only comes through the body
[1:15:32] it takes a body a union
[1:15:35] to give life to you
[1:15:41] it takes a father and a mother to come
[1:15:43] together for you to be born
[1:15:49] so even in our spiritual life
[1:15:54] for you to be able to express the life
[1:15:57] of christ you must be attached to a body
[1:16:06] are we together
[1:16:14] he's talking about the european union
[1:16:16] now
[1:16:17] why didn't he get something he just came
[1:16:20] from the revival he came from ethiopia
[1:16:22] traveled all the way down
[1:16:24] he went down that he went to the
[1:16:25] pentecostal feast
[1:16:29] praise the lord
[1:16:32] but he wasn't he was an island he was he
[1:16:34] was uh a stranger
[1:16:39] now god was now expressing himself
[1:16:43] through a body that was born at
[1:16:45] pentecost
[1:16:49] the holy ghost has come the promise of
[1:16:52] joy has come among the believers
[1:16:56] god has started a new thing
[1:17:00] a body was born
[1:17:04] praise the lord
[1:17:06] and all all the you know uh the the news
[1:17:09] went every word i mean these men are
[1:17:11] speaking in tongues and they are seeing
[1:17:13] everything that is happening everybody
[1:17:15] hearing in their own languages
[1:17:19] praise the lord
[1:17:21] he came to the feast of pentecost
[1:17:24] and then
[1:17:26] he was on his way back
[1:17:30] he enjoyed
[1:17:32] what the soul enjoyed hearing these
[1:17:35] people speaking in different language
[1:17:36] enjoyed you know just enjoy the
[1:17:38] blessings
[1:17:41] and on his way back he took
[1:17:43] isaiah prophet prophet said in his
[1:17:46] reading isaiah 53
[1:17:49] praise the lord
[1:17:53] and he's reading
[1:17:55] and it's just like he's reading
[1:17:58] you know
[1:18:01] reading french
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:06] cannot connect
[1:18:09] hazard 53 is wounded for our
[1:18:11] transgression who believe i will report
[1:18:14] who the arm of the lord is relayed to
[1:18:17] you know as i asking out of this
[1:18:19] question who will believe our report who
[1:18:21] is the arm of lord riveto
[1:18:24] and he shall come out as a tender plane
[1:18:26] and he's reading all of this
[1:18:28] it sounds good but he cannot put it
[1:18:30] together
[1:18:32] because what he's reading is about a
[1:18:35] body that he's not attached to
[1:18:42] he cannot put it together
[1:18:47] are we together
[1:18:51] why didn't he guess something he come
[1:18:53] back down steady
[1:18:54] the prophecy of isaiah adore an angel
[1:18:57] director philip
[1:18:59] but the germ of life
[1:19:01] had to come through the body oh
[1:19:04] philip oh brother now we are on the line
[1:19:08] where the gem of life comes from
[1:19:12] through the angel
[1:19:14] the angels show him where to go
[1:19:17] angel is a messenger
[1:19:21] praise the lord
[1:19:23] years as son philip
[1:19:27] remember now we're talking about harmony
[1:19:29] between the father
[1:19:30] and the son
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:33] praise the lord
[1:19:34] god now have a body on the earth
[1:19:38] called the pentecostal church or called
[1:19:41] pentecost called the first church called
[1:19:44] the book of arts whatever name we want
[1:19:46] to give it
[1:19:48] but you see that a heart to take a son
[1:19:53] that is born in that body
[1:19:58] praise the lord
[1:19:59] because life comes through the body
[1:20:06] just follow me in a little bit you see
[1:20:08] what we're driving down to here
[1:20:12] and philip had a gene
[1:20:14] uh a message the
[1:20:16] word
[1:20:18] that's how
[1:20:20] child can be born
[1:20:23] by the sea incorruptible
[1:20:27] not by guessing scripture
[1:20:32] amen amen
[1:20:35] now by putting our own scripture on
[1:20:38] scripture to our own understanding when
[1:20:40] the bible says we must lean that to our
[1:20:42] own understanding
[1:20:45] but in all of our ways we must
[1:20:47] acknowledge him
[1:20:51] that's how a child is born
[1:20:54] by the seed incorruptible
[1:20:57] now so what god was doing at that time
[1:21:02] it was
[1:21:03] 120
[1:21:05] that experienced the baptising of the
[1:21:07] holy ghost in the upper room
[1:21:10] these people were the possessor of the
[1:21:12] seed incorruptible
[1:21:16] praise the lord
[1:21:19] are we together
[1:21:22] and there is a man here that i mean
[1:21:25] travel travel hundreds of miles see the
[1:21:28] kind of a sacrifice
[1:21:34] he came to the revival enjoy all the
[1:21:36] excitement all the healing he saw and
[1:21:39] he's on his way back
[1:21:41] and if god don't help him if god don't
[1:21:43] meet him on the way he's going to travel
[1:21:45] back empty as he came
[1:21:49] he could go and talk about all the
[1:21:51] excitement oh i saw these men speaking
[1:21:53] in tongues and everybody heard me oh my
[1:21:55] goodness it was gracious but he's just
[1:21:57] traveling
[1:21:58] just like an empty barrel rolled down
[1:22:01] the hill making a lot of noise
[1:22:04] but don't have no substance
[1:22:12] praise the lord
[1:22:18] and god wants his children to have
[1:22:20] substance so so this is how the child is
[1:22:22] born philip
[1:22:25] lay his hands upon him philip baptized
[1:22:27] him in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:22:31] there comes forth the spirit of god
[1:22:35] so now
[1:22:36] the gem had to come from the body what
[1:22:40] body christ's body that philip was part
[1:22:43] of
[1:22:48] are we together
[1:22:50] what body christ's body correct philip
[1:22:53] was a member of the body
[1:22:58] so he was a carrier of the life
[1:23:06] are we together
[1:23:07] the harmony between the father
[1:23:10] and the son
[1:23:16] you know because we are not making
[1:23:18] church
[1:23:20] no we're not making church
[1:23:22] god is giving birth to sons and
[1:23:24] daughters
[1:23:27] and the way he did it in the first age
[1:23:29] he must always do it that
[1:23:33] thank you way it's not calling people
[1:23:35] can't join our church let let make
[1:23:37] church you know can't join our no no no
[1:23:39] no god is giving life to sons and
[1:23:42] daughters of god
[1:23:49] that's right
[1:23:50] and until we a possessor of his spirit
[1:23:53] paul said we are not of haze
[1:24:00] praise the lord
[1:24:09] i mean that's the reason why
[1:24:11] we we
[1:24:12] we don't have to drag any national
[1:24:14] spirit around because it's not going to
[1:24:16] work it's not going to help us
[1:24:18] amen
[1:24:21] it's either by the word or we are out
[1:24:30] so you see it in every age on on the
[1:24:32] types and shadow there were men that
[1:24:35] were attached to the messenger of the
[1:24:37] age
[1:24:39] let the
[1:24:40] elijah there he came challenge those
[1:24:43] prophets on the mountain
[1:24:45] and and just at the time he was leaving
[1:24:48] god says go and and and meet elisha on
[1:24:51] the field and you know put put his
[1:24:53] mentor on elijah
[1:24:55] which of course brother branham
[1:24:56] explained that elijah had to grow 10
[1:24:59] years
[1:25:01] to be able to fail fill that place
[1:25:04] he had to grow
[1:25:06] he had to learn
[1:25:11] it was not an overnight experience when
[1:25:13] he says where is the god of elijah
[1:25:16] it was not an overnight experience
[1:25:18] church
[1:25:21] he had to follow elijah across jordan
[1:25:26] he had to contend with the sons of the
[1:25:28] prophets
[1:25:30] it was not an overnight birth
[1:25:33] it was not a guessing game he was not
[1:25:35] guessing
[1:25:50] praise the lord
[1:25:52] it's so easy sometimes we get we get
[1:25:55] caught in in in excitement of a big
[1:25:57] group and in the excitement of many
[1:25:59] people
[1:26:01] but we have to watch that life
[1:26:03] we got to look at that lifeline
[1:26:06] and make sure that there is i mean there
[1:26:08] is just there's just one blood that is
[1:26:10] running through that lifeline and it
[1:26:12] must be the bleeding word
[1:26:18] praise the lord
[1:26:20] that's the only thing that connects us
[1:26:22] here is that's the bleeding word
[1:26:30] amen so you see it all through the
[1:26:31] scripture
[1:26:34] and yes and yes paul now
[1:26:37] you know he's talking to
[1:26:39] to uh to the corinthian church
[1:26:43] you know he's speaking to them
[1:26:47] that
[1:26:48] uh you may have
[1:26:53] ten thousand of instructors
[1:26:57] you have you have super preachers and
[1:26:59] super ministries and and you know and
[1:27:02] and man
[1:27:04] you know that has all of these uh uh
[1:27:07] public speaking ability
[1:27:12] praise the lord
[1:27:14] so you might have many many teachers
[1:27:17] but there's only one father
[1:27:21] praise the lord
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:24] he says there is only you have only one
[1:27:26] father
[1:27:27] it takes uh
[1:27:28] just one man to give to give birth you
[1:27:32] know
[1:27:33] praise the lord
[1:27:35] hallelujah
[1:27:38] so we so we see it and we understand
[1:27:41] that god throughout all the ages has
[1:27:43] worked this way
[1:27:45] and year paul
[1:27:46] uh
[1:27:48] he head on to timothy as his own
[1:27:51] as his own son
[1:27:53] you know just like
[1:27:55] elijah was saying my father my father
[1:27:58] the husband of israel
[1:28:01] paul also trained timid in in so much
[1:28:05] until he said he said tim i have fought
[1:28:07] a good fight
[1:28:09] he said it to his son
[1:28:13] just like david calls solomon
[1:28:16] and say i have done all of this do the
[1:28:19] same and show yourself a man
[1:28:22] that that principle
[1:28:24] is all through the scripture
[1:28:34] praise the lord
[1:28:37] you know people have made a shipwreck of
[1:28:40] themselves
[1:28:41] and of the faith because
[1:28:44] we don't we don't try to understand and
[1:28:47] learn what god is doing
[1:28:53] even even even in our own lives
[1:28:58] the grace of god comes we get excited
[1:29:00] and pretty soon we think that we are the
[1:29:02] one that is running the show
[1:29:06] we don't understand what god is doing
[1:29:11] we are dealing with an infinite god
[1:29:17] praise the lord
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:21] and that's what i want us to you know uh
[1:29:23] drive down a little bit and understand
[1:29:25] what what god is doing in this in this
[1:29:27] little little body on the corner of the
[1:29:29] street
[1:29:35] what is he trying to achieve here
[1:29:44] praise the lord
[1:29:49] what is he trying to achieve
[1:30:00] i want to hold i want to take
[1:30:03] you know you have these
[1:30:05] you have these uh
[1:30:08] one called
[1:30:10] you know uh scenario
[1:30:13] and one statement scenario
[1:30:15] you know that that stands out and and
[1:30:18] many times you know we build things
[1:30:21] around it
[1:30:23] but one of them i want to take this
[1:30:24] morning and i want us to study together
[1:30:27] praise the lord
[1:30:30] how can i overcome
[1:30:46] amen let's just study this uh
[1:30:49] this this together
[1:30:51] and then we will
[1:30:53] we will grab something here
[1:30:56] now
[1:30:58] the harmony of the father and the son
[1:31:01] is is is uh uh
[1:31:04] is going to exist between christ and the
[1:31:07] bride
[1:31:08] christ and the bride is husband and wife
[1:31:11] relationship
[1:31:12] amen
[1:31:15] father and son is his parent and child
[1:31:18] relationship
[1:31:20] praise the lord
[1:31:22] now so you see
[1:31:23] that's the two form of relationship that
[1:31:26] god deeds with us
[1:31:32] praise the lord
[1:31:33] amen
[1:31:34] he deals with us honor those form or
[1:31:38] relationship we we we just did not step
[1:31:41] into the word
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:45] he brought us true parents
[1:31:50] so even even
[1:31:53] on
[1:31:53] our new birth
[1:31:55] like jesus taught the the the the the
[1:31:59] story of the good samaritan
[1:32:03] when he when he when he take us out of
[1:32:05] our sin he trusts us in the key
[1:32:11] of an innkeeper
[1:32:14] praise the lord
[1:32:16] amen
[1:32:17] so when when god take us out of the word
[1:32:21] he trusts us in the cure of the holy
[1:32:24] ghost is the innkeeper
[1:32:28] and the holy ghost will work through a
[1:32:30] 5-4 ministry
[1:32:33] praise the lord
[1:32:35] amen
[1:32:37] are we together
[1:32:40] i want you to grab where we going now
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:43] now
[1:32:44] on the
[1:32:46] uh uh the care of the of the innkeeper
[1:32:50] he would deal with us as a child that
[1:32:53] was born and give us milk for us to eat
[1:32:56] and for our our muscles our spiritual
[1:32:59] strength to grow for us to grow in the
[1:33:02] lord and and we we
[1:33:04] we we go through the different stages as
[1:33:07] he deals with us
[1:33:09] and he brings us to the place of a
[1:33:12] mentor
[1:33:13] son and daughter of god
[1:33:17] praise the lord
[1:33:18] now honor the state of being sounds were
[1:33:22] he's dealing with us just like paul said
[1:33:25] to the galatians even though
[1:33:27] you are hearers of everything but god
[1:33:29] deals with you as a son
[1:33:32] amen
[1:33:35] so until
[1:33:36] we come to that place of spiritual
[1:33:39] maturity to understand what god is doing
[1:33:43] we don't we don't just
[1:33:45] be born and enter right into marriage
[1:33:48] relationship
[1:33:53] no you got to get on the parental
[1:33:56] relationship
[1:34:01] are we together
[1:34:04] because there's two things that we have
[1:34:06] to watch
[1:34:08] glory be to god
[1:34:10] now this uh this particular quote that
[1:34:12] we're going to read like i said is is
[1:34:15] one of these
[1:34:16] one standing code
[1:34:18] you know
[1:34:20] where brother branham says
[1:34:22] your pastor is your husband
[1:34:26] it's a one standing cult
[1:34:29] amen
[1:34:30] it has been a blessing to many and it
[1:34:32] have caused many damage
[1:34:36] they have ruined the life of meaning
[1:34:41] whenever there is a one standing
[1:34:44] statement
[1:34:45] it's always dangerous
[1:34:48] when it does not have support
[1:34:52] if you are not able to take it back to
[1:34:54] the scripture
[1:34:57] praise the lord
[1:34:59] i was visiting a
[1:35:01] little group in in in one town
[1:35:05] uh just spending uh the evening with
[1:35:07] them
[1:35:08] i preached a message i called into the
[1:35:10] scripture
[1:35:11] that was the message i preached for them
[1:35:14] that was
[1:35:16] last wednesday night
[1:35:21] jesus says session scripture
[1:35:25] amen
[1:35:26] he says search the scripture for in them
[1:35:31] there is there is no
[1:35:33] preacher in the bible
[1:35:35] that point back to the scripture like
[1:35:37] our lord jesus
[1:35:43] praise the lord
[1:35:47] he says search the scripture for in them
[1:35:50] they have spoken of me
[1:35:55] praise the lord
[1:35:56] so if we if we have
[1:35:58] you know uh uh that that foundation
[1:36:02] then i mean it's easy to be able to deal
[1:36:04] with some of these things amen
[1:36:06] it's very easy to be able to deal with
[1:36:09] these things because uh uh you know you
[1:36:11] you are able to to look at it you know
[1:36:14] and i was sharing with the believers i
[1:36:16] took that i took that uh
[1:36:19] uh jesus statements in john chapter 5 39
[1:36:22] and then i went over where paul says in
[1:36:25] corinthians 15 he said jesus died i call
[1:36:29] into the scripture
[1:36:32] he rose again according to the scripture
[1:36:36] no he was buried and rose again
[1:36:38] according to the scripture
[1:36:40] so i told the church we got to go back
[1:36:41] to the scripture we got to go from
[1:36:44] genesis to see his death barrier and
[1:36:46] resurrection
[1:36:47] because if you see it in the scripture
[1:36:50] nothing can take it away from you
[1:36:54] it's not just what a man says
[1:36:57] yes
[1:37:02] praise the lord
[1:37:06] amen so we took uh uh genesis chapter 22
[1:37:10] uh a little bit we share with you before
[1:37:12] we we're looking at the three days
[1:37:14] joining as jesus three this journey in
[1:37:17] hell
[1:37:22] abraham took three days joining with his
[1:37:24] son
[1:37:28] to get to the mountain
[1:37:32] so right in there was the death burial
[1:37:35] and resurrection
[1:37:37] we took rahab
[1:37:39] she told the spies go three days and
[1:37:42] hire yourself
[1:37:49] praise the lord and jesus had himself in
[1:37:51] the earth three days
[1:37:59] praise the lord
[1:38:02] so uh
[1:38:06] i want us to study this a little bit
[1:38:08] here this is 12 30
[1:38:11] and
[1:38:13] i'm still floating yet amen
[1:38:17] i'm still floating
[1:38:19] i can feed it
[1:38:23] praise the lord
[1:38:24] but let's let's read together yet a
[1:38:26] little bit
[1:38:27] and let's let's study let's see the
[1:38:28] establishment of this thought let's see
[1:38:30] where it was coming from now well lot
[1:38:33] wife
[1:38:34] did the same thing now we're talking
[1:38:36] about overcomers in every age verb is
[1:38:39] talking about overcomer in every age and
[1:38:41] how how to overcome just like i said
[1:38:44] it's not what to overcome but how to
[1:38:46] overcome
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:48] because if you know how to overcome you
[1:38:50] can overcome anything
[1:38:58] lord wife did the same thing you know
[1:39:01] she set out
[1:39:03] to go with lot
[1:39:05] follow her husband her children
[1:39:09] her loved ones
[1:39:11] but it wasn't in her heart
[1:39:16] she still loved the word
[1:39:18] praise the lord
[1:39:21] amen
[1:39:25] so
[1:39:26] it's possible
[1:39:28] you can make a stat
[1:39:31] and still be in and still be the word in
[1:39:34] you
[1:39:36] amen
[1:39:38] you are just coming along but you you're
[1:39:40] struggling with those those wallet
[1:39:42] desires
[1:39:43] and and and
[1:39:44] wallet habits amen and uh uh uh like i
[1:39:48] mean taking taking all
[1:39:50] i mean your your inspiration from the
[1:39:53] word instead of from the word of god
[1:39:54] amen
[1:39:58] see she never she never
[1:40:01] overcome
[1:40:02] and even though
[1:40:04] she was well on the road
[1:40:09] it finally overthrew her
[1:40:13] and that's what we are seeing with all
[1:40:15] of these people that are coming up with
[1:40:17] reason why they can't save the lord
[1:40:18] anymore reason why i stopped to be a
[1:40:20] christian
[1:40:21] reason why i'm not in the message
[1:40:24] praise the lord
[1:40:26] search the reason you can't even see a
[1:40:28] scriptural base
[1:40:33] they were overthrowed
[1:40:38] she had to take that one big long last
[1:40:42] look
[1:40:43] the angel said
[1:40:46] go and don't low back
[1:40:52] praise the lord
[1:40:53] go
[1:40:54] and don't look back
[1:41:00] but that was just something too hard for
[1:41:02] her to do
[1:41:04] because it was not what was behind her
[1:41:07] it was what was in her heart
[1:41:13] it was not what was behind her that made
[1:41:15] her to look back it was the desire that
[1:41:18] was in her heart
[1:41:19] that made her to look back
[1:41:22] so if that desire is not dead with
[1:41:25] praise the lord you can just hang on for
[1:41:27] dear life
[1:41:28] as long as you want to hang on but it's
[1:41:32] your desire that will take you back
[1:41:35] praise the lord
[1:41:37] amen
[1:41:38] those men came across the red sea they
[1:41:40] saw the egyptians drawn and and and they
[1:41:43] saw the sea coming back together
[1:41:46] there is no way to there is no road to
[1:41:48] go
[1:41:50] but yet the desire for the garlic of
[1:41:52] egypt
[1:41:54] was in their heart
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:57] there is no road to go back but yet they
[1:42:00] want to go back
[1:42:03] it's not because they know how to carry
[1:42:05] themselves back it's all because they
[1:42:07] are honoring an influence of a desire in
[1:42:09] their heart
[1:42:13] even though they don't know any role to
[1:42:15] go back they're still going to drown
[1:42:17] themselves it's your desire that will
[1:42:19] drown you
[1:42:25] praise the lord
[1:42:31] if you don't destroy it it will destroy
[1:42:32] you
[1:42:38] praise the lord
[1:42:43] big long last look there were she got
[1:42:46] cut
[1:42:47] don't even look back
[1:42:50] don't have no desire keep going
[1:42:53] put your mind on cavalry
[1:42:56] and keep moving
[1:42:58] towards christ
[1:43:01] praise the lord
[1:43:03] she started out
[1:43:05] as an overcomer we can do this
[1:43:08] praise the lord
[1:43:10] amen
[1:43:11] i mean she she's in the prayer meeting
[1:43:13] she's in the choir she's i mean she
[1:43:15] started out
[1:43:16] we can do this
[1:43:20] started out as an
[1:43:22] overcomer but she never did overcome
[1:43:27] oh she left the denomination she did she
[1:43:30] walked out of sodom with lot
[1:43:34] but she wanted to go back
[1:43:38] and have her haircut
[1:43:41] you know what i mean
[1:43:43] you know he's just throwing that in you
[1:43:45] know see
[1:43:46] she had to go back
[1:43:48] she just couldn't stand the tests she
[1:43:52] had to look back again to see what the
[1:43:55] rest of them are doing
[1:43:58] instead of looking at what god is doing
[1:44:01] her interest was to see what the others
[1:44:04] are doing amen praise the lord
[1:44:07] she got to respond to every post on
[1:44:10] facebook
[1:44:13] that just meant dropping that in there
[1:44:15] [Laughter]
[1:44:18] that's me just dropping that in there
[1:44:20] don't mind me
[1:44:22] i'm trying to keep myself awake
[1:44:25] praise the lord
[1:44:29] let's set it together yeah there's the
[1:44:31] place of interest i want to bring you
[1:44:34] amen she had to look back see what the
[1:44:36] rest of them are doing oh you know i had
[1:44:39] some good friends down there after all
[1:44:43] and after all
[1:44:45] this my
[1:44:47] this my
[1:44:48] just a little a little move
[1:44:51] now if you look at this you have to
[1:44:53] remember it's jesus own teaching
[1:44:57] jesus was the one
[1:44:59] in luke 17 that says remembers lot's
[1:45:04] wife
[1:45:05] that's jesus own teaching
[1:45:10] amen
[1:45:11] so which means
[1:45:13] there is something about that story that
[1:45:15] is very important
[1:45:19] and he's identifying it over to the very
[1:45:23] age where the son of man will be
[1:45:25] revealed
[1:45:28] in the revealing of the son of man
[1:45:30] remember lost wife
[1:45:32] and there's a lot there to remember
[1:45:38] praise the lord
[1:45:40] oh let's just take a little
[1:45:42] journey and and
[1:45:44] and and think about what was happening
[1:45:46] we know what happened that love went
[1:45:48] down there he went he went to sodom you
[1:45:51] know uh uh uh a separator from abraham
[1:45:55] praise the lord
[1:45:57] but you see he he carried he carried
[1:46:00] most of the things that he learned from
[1:46:02] abraham amen in his heart he still had a
[1:46:04] desire to to worship that god that
[1:46:07] abraham was always talking about that is
[1:46:10] telling him you know what about elaine
[1:46:11] uh
[1:46:12] uh uh that he was going to be the father
[1:46:15] of many nations lord god his wife and
[1:46:18] and the bible says they had two
[1:46:20] daughters
[1:46:22] glory be to god
[1:46:24] amen
[1:46:28] hallelujah
[1:46:30] there is there is a there is a there's a
[1:46:32] biblical principle here that you have to
[1:46:34] watch every time the scripture tells us
[1:46:37] to watch something you have to look at
[1:46:39] it very closely because it's fulfilling
[1:46:42] something major
[1:46:45] praise the lord
[1:46:47] are we together
[1:46:49] now lord went down to sutton with his
[1:46:51] wife and his two daughters
[1:46:54] because
[1:46:56] they were under
[1:46:58] the the teaching
[1:47:00] of abraham they were honored the
[1:47:02] protection of abraham they got down
[1:47:05] there to saw them with all the pollution
[1:47:09] and all the evil things that were
[1:47:11] happening in sodom
[1:47:13] god
[1:47:14] kept the life of these two young girls
[1:47:20] praise the lord
[1:47:21] even though we will learn
[1:47:23] that there were other children that came
[1:47:25] along
[1:47:27] because the prophet of god said she she
[1:47:29] looked back because she was thinking
[1:47:31] about her grandchildren
[1:47:37] well
[1:47:37] a picture of of the last this church
[1:47:41] is the alberta and says when lord wife
[1:47:43] got down there she became part of all
[1:47:45] the society she joined the women
[1:47:47] community committee she joined this
[1:47:49] other one she joined this other one and
[1:47:51] all of that and then you realize that
[1:47:53] there were a lot of children that came
[1:47:55] along
[1:47:57] that turned out not to be lost children
[1:48:01] because the scripture make emphasis on
[1:48:04] the two daughters
[1:48:06] than the rest of the children
[1:48:13] so this was a church that got herself
[1:48:15] into the word
[1:48:18] just like revelation 18 17 church that
[1:48:21] god pregnant with with many seeds of
[1:48:24] adultery
[1:48:25] trying to be part of everything
[1:48:31] praise the lord
[1:48:32] and she brought children of every
[1:48:34] committee and every society she joined
[1:48:36] she bring for a child of that society
[1:48:41] the blessings of abraham was upon these
[1:48:44] two
[1:48:48] those were the two that could hear the
[1:48:50] the angel voice
[1:48:52] abraham tell those
[1:48:54] men sodomites
[1:48:57] and say i have two daughters that are
[1:49:00] virgins
[1:49:04] praise the lord
[1:49:08] are you seeing the principle that's the
[1:49:10] last this age
[1:49:18] remember lord's wife
[1:49:21] glory be to god
[1:49:23] amen
[1:49:26] now so she came out as son as an
[1:49:29] overcomer
[1:49:31] but she never did overcome on oh
[1:49:35] she left the denomination she walked out
[1:49:37] of sodom with lot but she wanted to go
[1:49:40] back
[1:49:41] praise the lord
[1:49:43] she had to go back she just couldn't
[1:49:44] stand the test
[1:49:46] she had to go back
[1:49:49] and see what the rest of them was doing
[1:49:52] praise the lord
[1:49:54] i don't know whether
[1:49:56] it could be right
[1:49:58] i have only got
[1:49:59] this man word for it now she's uh she's
[1:50:02] the one talking now
[1:50:03] she's uh i don't know if this will be
[1:50:05] right he's the one that says the angel
[1:50:07] said we should get out amen i only have
[1:50:10] this man word for it she's referring to
[1:50:12] lord watch carefully now
[1:50:14] as we study this together
[1:50:17] she's referring to love i don't know
[1:50:20] whether it could be right i want to have
[1:50:22] this man this uh only god this man were
[1:50:26] for a dog he's my husband
[1:50:30] now
[1:50:32] there the statement comes in
[1:50:37] your pastor
[1:50:39] is your husband
[1:50:41] spiritually speaking
[1:50:45] lord was not the messenger of that age
[1:50:49] abraham was the messenger
[1:50:53] praise the lord i want for you to study
[1:50:56] carefully now
[1:50:58] praise the lord
[1:51:00] amen
[1:51:02] lord was not the messenger
[1:51:06] it was abraham that was interceding
[1:51:11] elohim was in the camp of abraham
[1:51:18] praise the lord
[1:51:21] because this one-line statement
[1:51:25] has created a lot of havoc
[1:51:33] it has wrong wrong people and and
[1:51:36] and and and actually when you look at
[1:51:39] you look at the expression as you go
[1:51:41] there and you will realize that this was
[1:51:43] just a passing statement it was not even
[1:51:46] a doctrine
[1:51:50] it was not a doctrine
[1:51:59] praise the lord
[1:52:12] i cannot take this man word for it i
[1:52:14] only got this i mean uh uh i don't know
[1:52:18] whether it could be right i've only got
[1:52:20] this man word for it
[1:52:22] though he is my husband
[1:52:24] but yet
[1:52:26] your pastor is your husband spiritually
[1:52:28] speaking you see
[1:52:29] now whether
[1:52:32] whether it could be right or not
[1:52:35] i don't know
[1:52:37] maybe his revelation wasn't right
[1:52:41] then
[1:52:42] if you are perfectly satisfied
[1:52:47] you are not
[1:52:50] perfectly know that it's the word of god
[1:52:53] then
[1:52:55] you can go see you've got to be really
[1:52:58] so out
[1:53:00] now so my question
[1:53:02] over the years
[1:53:04] how is that phrase
[1:53:06] related to everything that is here right
[1:53:08] here
[1:53:14] they are phrased that have empowered men
[1:53:17] over the ages
[1:53:20] problem says i'm your husband
[1:53:23] i'm the spiritual hustler
[1:53:26] what was he referring to here
[1:53:28] what was he teaching
[1:53:40] praise the lord
[1:53:46] i hope when you go home tonight you'll
[1:53:48] have a good night's sleep
[1:54:00] god has used the both relationship
[1:54:03] he have used the parental relationship
[1:54:06] and he have also used the marriage
[1:54:09] relationship to deal with his church
[1:54:13] amen
[1:54:14] he have used the parental relationship
[1:54:17] to nurture us as children
[1:54:21] amen
[1:54:22] and you have also used the marriage
[1:54:25] relationship
[1:54:26] to establish us to position a place us
[1:54:32] in our age and our dispensation
[1:54:35] not even in the body
[1:54:39] because it's a dispensational thing when
[1:54:41] you come to the bride
[1:54:47] praise the lord
[1:54:48] are we together
[1:54:52] as i was thinking about this a couple of
[1:54:54] weeks ago
[1:54:56] just before
[1:54:58] travel i was
[1:54:59] studying and i was thinking about basing
[1:55:02] and i went back and started listening to
[1:55:04] the prophet of god
[1:55:06] i mean my mind was blown
[1:55:09] my mind was completely blown let's
[1:55:10] travel together here a little bit
[1:55:13] and see
[1:55:16] now he's talking about
[1:55:20] lord's wife struggling over
[1:55:23] the instruction of her husband
[1:55:26] praise the lord
[1:55:27] which of course he's the head of the
[1:55:29] whom
[1:55:31] amen
[1:55:34] he's the one the angel spoke to and said
[1:55:36] get out of here i can do nothing until
[1:55:38] you get out
[1:55:43] praise the lord
[1:55:44] and and she told he told his family and
[1:55:47] says i mean uh uh susan we got to get
[1:55:50] out of here whether that was her name on
[1:55:52] that but we will use it amen
[1:55:58] an angel said we shouldn't look back
[1:56:02] let's just keep going
[1:56:06] amen
[1:56:08] and they were going and they had the two
[1:56:10] daughters going
[1:56:15] praise the lord
[1:56:17] the blessing of abraham kept those girls
[1:56:20] and they were going hallelujah
[1:56:24] amen
[1:56:28] a year on the away girl when she came
[1:56:31] out she joined the group and on their
[1:56:33] way during a year she's struggling in
[1:56:36] her he's describing her struggling in
[1:56:39] her mind struggling in in her desires
[1:56:45] well if it is true what god didn't why
[1:56:46] the injured two did not appear to me
[1:56:49] it's only a lot
[1:56:50] i don't know i i don't know why i mean
[1:56:52] if they destroy down it we did not
[1:56:54] destroy where we are going she's
[1:56:56] struggling with all of these things in
[1:56:58] her mind
[1:57:03] praise the lord
[1:57:06] it comes under the context of leadership
[1:57:11] he's bringing a context of leadership
[1:57:19] he's now dealing with the context of a
[1:57:22] direct relationship
[1:57:26] amen
[1:57:28] because it's a a a
[1:57:31] a lot harder message from the angel he
[1:57:34] told his wife
[1:57:36] amen
[1:57:38] and they are going she had she had a
[1:57:40] choice to stay if she wanted to
[1:57:45] so he's dealing with the context of
[1:57:48] leadership
[1:57:50] praise the lord and we know
[1:57:53] that sons of god are led by the spirit
[1:57:57] of god
[1:57:58] god have not set a man over the church
[1:58:02] to be the leader the holy ghost is the
[1:58:04] leader
[1:58:09] the man must be under the leadership of
[1:58:11] the holy ghost to lead the people in the
[1:58:14] world
[1:58:16] so he's dealing with the context of
[1:58:18] leadership he's not dealing with the
[1:58:21] context of me getting myself involved in
[1:58:23] your life and your decision
[1:58:44] praise the lord
[1:58:48] because that is the card
[1:58:52] that people with men's leadership
[1:58:55] that impose themselves on the people
[1:58:57] that's the card they draw out
[1:59:00] i'm the spiritual husband you have to do
[1:59:02] as i say
[1:59:13] he's dealing with the context of
[1:59:16] leadership
[1:59:21] amen
[1:59:23] praise the lord
[1:59:24] and if i get honor the context of
[1:59:26] leadership
[1:59:28] if i get under the context of leadership
[1:59:31] i will tell you that when it comes over
[1:59:34] to the family life
[1:59:40] god set a man
[1:59:41] in your home
[1:59:47] your husbands
[1:59:51] if we deal with the context of
[1:59:53] leadership
[1:59:58] if i'm on the leadership of the holy
[2:00:01] spirit
[2:00:04] that is backed by the scripture
[2:00:07] i must not step over your husband and
[2:00:10] rule over you
[2:00:14] praise the lord
[2:00:15] you must not trash your husband down and
[2:00:18] say i will go to the pastor
[2:00:20] that's wrong leadership
[2:00:24] honor the context of leadership
[2:00:27] that's what he was dealing with
[2:00:34] praise the lord
[2:00:35] amen
[2:00:36] you find in all of these uh uh uh
[2:00:40] spiritual church's year the pastor dead
[2:00:42] he cycled with all of the women
[2:00:45] the other one leaving the church the
[2:00:47] spiritual people they're right behind
[2:00:49] him
[2:00:56] praise the lord
[2:01:00] it's honored the context of leadership
[2:01:05] it's a divine order
[2:01:10] the bible says if a woman will learn
[2:01:12] anything let her ask her husband at home
[2:01:19] that's the divine order
[2:01:25] you see that's the reason why
[2:01:28] harmony is important
[2:01:32] because if the harmony of the spirit is
[2:01:34] not there we will break these laws and
[2:01:37] trying to look for godly results
[2:01:42] you cannot get godly result when you
[2:01:44] break god's laws
[2:01:52] he's dealing with the context
[2:01:55] of leadership
[2:01:58] and it even gets better
[2:02:02] it even gets better
[2:02:05] oh praise the lord
[2:02:08] you love the lord
[2:02:11] amen
[2:02:12] that's the reason why i hope you
[2:02:14] understand what we are doing here
[2:02:16] praise the lord amen
[2:02:20] we are not uh we're not in coming around
[2:02:22] the man
[2:02:26] no we want to get under the right
[2:02:28] leadership of the holy spirit
[2:02:40] are we together
[2:02:43] praise the
[2:02:44] lord amen you know this is the word that
[2:02:47] rules
[2:02:49] praise the lord
[2:02:51] and that's the reason why you know the
[2:02:52] bible says let a woman keep silence
[2:02:55] when the words start lining up like this
[2:02:57] the church is easy to go silent
[2:03:00] because it's the word that rules
[2:03:04] just leave the world down oh you can get
[2:03:06] there god bless you here that's it
[2:03:09] when you're working there out in emotion
[2:03:11] start to lay the word down the church
[2:03:14] will keep selling
[2:03:17] that's what the apostle paul says let
[2:03:19] the church keep silent
[2:03:21] when the word is in his place
[2:03:24] that is the highest authority in the
[2:03:26] local church that is the word of god
[2:03:29] nothing is above the word
[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:33] and if we will get result we must do it
[2:03:35] the way god says in his word
[2:03:38] amen god god is obligated to his word
[2:03:41] now to our selfish desires and selfish
[2:03:43] motives
[2:03:46] and self-breed
[2:03:49] things in our mind
[2:03:52] you know one thing that gave richard
[2:03:53] hard time in her travel
[2:03:56] was the adult of her father
[2:04:01] you have to remember rachel stole the
[2:04:04] idol of her father and she hated
[2:04:06] jacob never even knew about it
[2:04:09] because jacob swore before his father if
[2:04:11] you finally the person you found with
[2:04:13] let them die
[2:04:14] he prophesied death over his wife
[2:04:21] and she died in childbirth
[2:04:25] she struggled
[2:04:26] with the idol of her father
[2:04:30] and that's what people struggle with
[2:04:34] they travel with that idol
[2:04:37] it's in their spirit it's in their mind
[2:04:40] and they try to bring everything through
[2:04:42] it have to come true that way of
[2:04:44] understanding
[2:05:01] praise the lord
[2:05:04] [Music]
[2:05:12] but the word has come to make us free
[2:05:16] for he that the world made free this
[2:05:18] free indeed
[2:05:19] if we can just embrace truth
[2:05:22] and say lord deliver me from all my
[2:05:24] idols
[2:05:25] i'm ready to break them down i'm ready
[2:05:27] to get rid of them amen
[2:05:31] praise the lord
[2:05:33] scripture says where your treasure is
[2:05:36] there where your heart will be
[2:05:39] her treasure her heart was where her
[2:05:42] treasure was and her treasure was her
[2:05:45] idol
[2:05:47] that she hate
[2:05:55] her treasure was her idol that she had
[2:06:02] we have hidden
[2:06:03] hidden idols
[2:06:05] hidden denominational idols
[2:06:08] hating message idols
[2:06:20] she had a prophecy of death hanging over
[2:06:23] her
[2:06:25] because jacob said it
[2:06:27] yeah
[2:06:37] look people the scripture is deep
[2:06:43] we are not
[2:06:44] we are not gathering around feebles of
[2:06:47] men
[2:06:48] the one that we have to deal with is
[2:06:50] almighty god
[2:06:52] and we better bring our hearts right

[2:07:26] be right or not i don't know that's that
[2:07:28] lost wife dealing with her own struggle

[2:07:35] then if if if you are not perfectly
[2:07:38] satisfied

[2:08:17] of your internet churches

[2:08:22] it this way

[2:08:48] think we know what we're doing
[2:08:56] he says
[2:08:58] you do feel
[2:09:01] you can just leave now brown switching
[2:09:04] over here now this is at the closing
[2:09:06] closing of the of that message he
[2:09:08] preached
[2:09:09] now he's encouraged the people into
[2:09:11] overcoming but there's something he said
[2:09:13] here very important that it just blew my
[2:09:15] mind it blew my mind
[2:09:16] he's encouraging the church here he said
[2:09:18] do you feel that you you can just leave
[2:09:20] everything you're burdened
[2:09:23] you can just walk over above it now
[2:09:27] if you do raise up your hands by god's
[2:09:30] grace
[2:09:31] i'll lay
[2:09:32] my tries down
[2:09:35] i won't fight anymore
[2:09:37] praise the lord
[2:09:38] he's talking about committing to the
[2:09:40] world because it's the word i overcome
[2:09:42] now you overcoming
[2:09:44] you are no match to the devil
[2:09:46] praise the lord
[2:09:48] amen
[2:09:49] no it's the word that overcomes
[2:09:52] so he said you are surrounding to the
[2:09:53] word
[2:10:00] by the grace of god i won't fight
[2:10:02] anymore
[2:10:04] i'm just going to take a hold of his
[2:10:06] hands
[2:10:08] and start walking
[2:10:10] take a hold of god's hands
[2:10:13] and start walking i have fought yeah i
[2:10:15] have fought he said brother
[2:10:17] i've tried to quit smoking i've tried i
[2:10:20] tried to help let my head grow out you
[2:10:22] know all of those different things we
[2:10:23] all can identify things in our life that
[2:10:26] we're fighting and struggling with don't
[2:10:28] pretend like you don't have one
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:41] i have tried so hard brother branham i
[2:10:44] just can do it don't try anymore
[2:10:47] just take a hold of his hands and say
[2:10:50] father you put my hands in the sleeves
[2:10:55] see
[2:10:56] i'm just going to give you my hands
[2:11:01] i'm going to walk on lord
[2:11:03] looking to you
[2:11:07] it will
[2:11:08] happen he will dress you like a real
[2:11:12] christian
[2:11:14] amen
[2:11:16] you will be a real christian
[2:11:18] until
[2:11:21] i can see you
[2:11:22] for the next series he says tonight
[2:11:25] god love you and be with you
[2:11:28] you are my children in the gospel now
[2:11:31] that's the thing that blow my mind
[2:11:34] if brother branham was establishing the
[2:11:36] doctrine
[2:11:37] after saying that your pastor is your
[2:11:39] husband
[2:11:41] he will have stayed with the thought
[2:11:44] that i am your husband
[2:11:47] but he goes back to the scriptural
[2:11:49] principle
[2:11:52] then you are my children
[2:12:07] it's the same message honor the same
[2:12:09] inspiration
[2:12:11] why should he change his thought
[2:12:14] what was he trying to establish
[2:12:17] that he should say your pastor is your
[2:12:19] spiritual husband close the service and
[2:12:21] say you are my children
[2:12:43] i told you we owned this for a
[2:12:46] while we are on this for a while
[2:12:51] and we will trust and pray that the holy
[2:12:53] spirit will help us
[2:12:55] praise the lord
[2:12:57] amen
[2:12:59] he says just put your hands in his hands
[2:13:02] he says he would dress you like a real
[2:13:04] christian
[2:13:05] amen
[2:13:07] stop start trying and start fighting on
[2:13:09] your own
[2:13:11] just surrounded to he that have overcome
[2:13:14] he have overcome death health and the
[2:13:16] grace
[2:13:19] praise the lord
[2:13:23] he will dress you like a real christian
[2:13:24] you'll be a real christian until i see
[2:13:26] you tonight god love you and be with you
[2:13:29] you are my children in the gospel
[2:13:32] you are the purchase
[2:13:40] praise the lord
[2:13:42] so we realized that
[2:13:44] the spirit that have drive
[2:13:47] that one phrase
[2:13:49] that one-line doctrine
[2:13:51] that have grown homes and ruined the
[2:13:53] life of people
[2:13:56] that have possessed the inheritance of
[2:13:58] people and possessed their lives
[2:14:01] because they think they had an
[2:14:02] instruction
[2:14:03] from a prophet that they are a spiritual
[2:14:05] husband that was an evil spirit
[2:14:10] that was now what god's prophet was
[2:14:12] teaching
[2:14:13] he stayed in the context of god's word
[2:14:16] there is nowhere in the scripture where
[2:14:18] paul says you are my wife
[2:14:22] he says you are my children in the lord
[2:14:24] and i have exposed you to christ
[2:14:27] as a chaste virgin
[2:14:31] [Applause]
[2:14:47] praise the lord
[2:14:54] now so we see here that
[2:14:56] uh
[2:15:01] that's the two form of relationship that
[2:15:03] god has did with his
[2:15:06] his church
[2:15:08] he put us
[2:15:10] on a ministry
[2:15:14] to parent us
[2:15:19] amen
[2:15:20] the ministry is to be apparent unto you
[2:15:27] praise the lord
[2:15:36] i don't think
[2:15:39] i'm qualified
[2:15:41] in a ministry
[2:15:44] to call people like brother wesley my
[2:15:46] son in the lord
[2:15:49] people that have been serving the lord
[2:15:50] before i was born
[2:15:54] but i also think it's a privilege
[2:15:59] when i see god
[2:16:00] trust people like that to me
[2:16:03] i don't take advantage of it
[2:16:09] i know the ability is not in the man is
[2:16:12] the holy spirit the parent
[2:16:23] but that's god's principle
[2:16:27] it must not be overlooked
[2:16:30] [Music]
[2:16:32] you cannot turn around says what is what
[2:16:34] is his age said which year he was born
[2:16:38] that small little thing behind our
[2:16:39] pulpit i've been serving god before
[2:16:41] before he even uh
[2:16:43] he was just in diapers when i got saved
[2:16:50] praise the lord
[2:16:51] whether i was in a womb or i was in
[2:16:53] dapper it pleased the lord
[2:16:56] for this body
[2:16:59] to place me over this local assembly
[2:17:02] and then i must submit myself to the
[2:17:04] holy ghost
[2:17:05] to be able to parent you in the world
[2:17:12] that's the way god ordained it
[2:17:13] [Applause]
[2:17:20] that's the way he ordained it
[2:17:24] praise the lord
[2:17:27] i don't need to bring a chisel on it and
[2:17:29] make myself tall
[2:17:43] are we together you understand why i'm
[2:17:44] going this morning

[2:18:44] every

[2:18:51] for him to create that connection the
[2:18:53] attachment we have to our earthly
[2:18:55] parents
[2:18:58] is because we were birthed by them
[2:19:02] amen
[2:19:03] so for god to create that connection
[2:19:06] he will put you under a ministry that
[2:19:09] will break you in an experience
[2:19:12] not for your your your new breath but
[2:19:14] that ministry will break you in an
[2:19:17] experience because that's where the
[2:19:19] trust comes
