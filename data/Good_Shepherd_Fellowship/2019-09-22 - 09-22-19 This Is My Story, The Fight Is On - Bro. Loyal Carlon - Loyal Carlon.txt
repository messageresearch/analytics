a full rainbow around the throne amen so there's a full rainbow before God but he only gave us half because of time amen so if you want to know the rest of your rainbow story go to the throne amen that's what the complete story praise the Lord praise the Lord Allah bless you you may have your seat it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen we greet each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus I see a young man there god bless you my friend good to have you visiting with us I praise the Lord and the Lord has been good amen he's being so good praise the Lord we could just sing of his goodness over and over and over and over praise the Lord because he has been so so good amen don't stand to your feet I would just want to read few scriptures to you this morning we've been speaking about the burning power and little by little trying to bring out you know what what has been on my heart but this morning we have a different kind of service and believing that the Holy Spirit will come out and be a blessing to us all most especially to to our young people praise the Lord amen Saint John chapter 6 let's look there quickly like I see a saying you see and for the mother farm another one preaching this morning so you can rest assure that you will have a good preacher than me amen praise the Lord Prison or email but in st. John chapter 6 Jesus says something I've been thinking about it all through the week as I have been speaking on this subject of the bound in power he said in in verse 37 if you want to look there closely with me in verse 35 Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life that cometh and he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that you also have seen me and I believe now all that the father has given me that's what the burning power is for amen this is a parental statement this is a claiming power jesus said all that the father has given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out all that the father has given to me praise the Lord amen now jesus said this to be to claim his own now if Christ is in you you can see the same thing amen if Christ is in you you can you can see the same thing now this is not just a male words this is a word of relationship I mean Jesus had a relationship with the father to be able to claim all that the father has given to him he said all that the father has given to me will come unto me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out praise the Lord amen so so get ready for that that's my next series of messages I will be preaching all that the father has given me so you can claim there for your marriage you can claim there for your children you can claim that and as a preacher I'm claiming there for every souls that come on in my ministry praise the Lord but you see you first have to have a relationship with the father as I chapter 49 verse 16 let's look at their quickly [Music] now in the we talk about the the bonny power now you can understand what we're talking about praise the Lord because that's the power that has been given to the church that was whoever we burn on earth whatsoever we bound to keep amen whatever we bound to claim will be bound are we together as I a chapter 49 verse [Music] 13 sing o heaven and be joyful all earth break forth into singing all mountains for the Lord has comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted him in but Zion said the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her warm oh my goodness amen praise the Lord we have a parable that stays or yeah the parable that says there is no Bible for a child amen a mother don't have a Bible to draw her child no matter how worse he is he stays mama baby praise the Lord a woman cannot forsake her chuckling yeah they yeah they may be forgetting yet will I not forget thee behold I have engraving be upon the palms of my hands the walls are continuously before me praise the Lord and this is the word of God to Israel this is the Word of God to his redeemed people amen even though we we live in such an age where motherhood has fallen and then we have in order some of the things that we have before us of mother but God sees even though if a mother ever go to that place yet I God will net for safety and and as we know in the scripture every time God use a language where he positioned himself as as a mother or as a female is always a redemption language why because promise of the Redeemer was given to the woman the woman seizure bruised the head of the seven so when Jesus said all Israel how I will have power you like a hand that's Redemption language a mother will forsake her child I will not forsake thee that's redemption language for I have grieve indeed upon the palm of my hand and he he he did it physically when he was kneel on the cross as I a prophet sad about it but he did it physically every every Roman nail that went through his hands your name was engraved on the palm of his hands praise the Lord amen amen amen so all that the father has given me will come unto me and I want amen that will come that will ever last so that's what we've been talking in this season and I just want to say here to you you know it is just like my camel experience Elijah said all things is ready I believe that that everything is ready for us to be able to have a breakthrough from God amen everything is ready for a revival everything is ready for God to be able to prove his self again the only thing that is left as a people that was surrounded God has everything ready the heaven is so set to break fall to the earth dangers are anxious to run into your mess but he's waiting for the people that I ready because if you are not ready even if God does it you won't see it you won't see it [Music] but it's gonna be in the house of the Lord amen amen this morning her lawyer will speak to us he's been having the burden on his heart to to talk to us as a church as a people so we can say one of our own if you don't feel like that I feel like that amen let us worship the Lord man as we stand to our feet like a trifold on the [Music] you took the fall you tired of me ever poor crucify who say five let me hi the store you live to town I rejected and I love I got trampled on the ride you took the fall you tired of me ever praise the Lord let you think that's a song I wanted to teach young people now let's

turn to the person beside you and if you haven't been saying I'm gonna pray for you I'm gonna pray for you praise Lord amen Jordan you can turn this down a little bit it's getting some feedback up here praise the Lord let's sing that chorus and then we'll go to the word he wasn't looking at me when he took me in you want to bring me mids and lows a little down a little bit Jordan it's getting some feedback up here he wasn't looking at me wasn't looking at you you what I don't know it's a different key than what we were just singing I think he wasn't looking at me when he took me in how many's thankful for this this morning he wasn't looking at my heart that was back by sea no he was looking at the blonde blowing rich and free they're precious love that covers me he wasn't looking at me when it took he wasn't looking at my heart that was black spicy he was looking at the blood when Jeffrey never that govern me sing it one more time like you mean it oh he wasn't looking at me any third in the Lord all the looking at my now but they he was [Music] treasure that cover can be amen you may be seated this morning just for a minute here amen praise Lord I love that song and it's you know it's funny because we start to think you cannot gain God's favor by your works that's living under works if we're coming to God saying oh well I've done this then God can't accept me or I've done this God should accept me you that's not the way it works we're coming under the shed blood of Jesus Christ that that God that the Son of God who knew no sin became sin for us that we could become the very righteousness of God we become worthy because he made us worthy and so if you don't feel worthy this morning I don't feel worthy either this morning I don't at all I don't feel worthy every mistake I've ever made comes to my mind before I get up and preach every mistake that it just comes to like you've done this you're this you've done this but that's not my identity he whom the Spirit has made free is free indeed that's my identity my identity is found in Christ my identity is not found in my past or even in my worries about the future it's not based upon this body of flesh it's what God said it's not what what I mind or my memories or my imagination says it's what God said about me let God's Word be true in every man's word a lie and you need to find that in yourself that you can grab hold on that that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what our minds say we we like Jobe said though he slay me yet I'll serve him job was going through a rough time he you look at it the entire passage we only remember that he's complaining to God the entire book so God what's the deal the entire book yet something within him said though he slave me slay me yet I'll serve him you saying god I don't understand I don't understand what's going on but I'll still serve you I'll still serve you he found that place he found his identity in the Word of God praise the Lord Amen so praise the Lord let's have church this morning amen praise Lord amen I appreciate the presence of God in here this morning I'm ready to have Church I hope you brought your your licks of fire this morning you can just take that clock down now because I'm not even gonna look at it I'm not I'm not kidding I don't know how this sermon is gonna go it's been on my heart for a long time I tried to write notes in an outline and it's like I just can't you can't take your heart and put it into logic you can kind of write an outline but it's like I'm just gonna preach from my heart this morning or or testify from my heart I don't really know I'm just trusting God that um that he's going to lead and guide this morning as with every service you know we come here I was thinking Wednesday night we had a great service and I just loved the way everything dovetailed together the song service dad testifying the word and it's like you know I think sometimes people think I'm really proud of her the Lawrence the way he's getting it's it's it's going in those stages of learning to follow God follow the leadership of the Spirit because it's not calculated um which you guys can be seated by the way sorry um it's not a calculated like okay I'm gonna sing this song this is gonna make people cry and then I'm gonna sing this song is just gonna make people excited that's not what it is at all I think people don't realize that as as worship leaders and things like that we're just as surprised as you are some like I was thinking about Wednesday I was like man I was not expecting to be out in the aisle tonight I just came from you know working out and working it's like God comes and moves and it's as we're able to yield to that spirit I love what brother but one set is that the spirit is here I believe that this area is ripe it is ready there's something going on here and it is ready and have to be yielded and paying attention paying attention to what God wants to do in our lives and as an assembly God is moving it's the same God all along you know we look back in the Bible and we see them and it's like it's it's so compressed you it's just a summary right of all the things that God did and we don't think about the space in-between we don't think about Abraham getting up in the morning with his aching body and his aching back and he's just like Lord you know he's trying he's encouraging himself in the Lord he's reconnecting you look at the struggles that he went where they went through with Sarah recommending Hagar basically like hey we can find a way we're bringing our human reasoning in this into this to make the move of God happen you those struggles those human struggles that happen and we all have the same thing in our own lives we're learning to walk and to wait upon God to go with him as he leads so um we're just gonna jump in into the word here and let's so go ahead and stand and we'll read a couple passages and then we'll just jump in and I just trust please pray for me this morning like I said I'm just trusting the Lord on this we'll go to Psalms 1 it's a very familiar passage we always we've heard this a million times but as I always say our trying to always say when I preach is I want us to take these scriptures as if we've never heard them before because then we'll pay attention to what they're saying we get so familiar with scriptures that we don't we're not even listening we just hear they're like oh yeah I know that says we can almost at work we're counted by heart we want to stop and listen and really let that word soak in if you're there say amen amen blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night and he shall be planted he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth he fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper and let's go ahead and turn over to Ecclesiastes 9 where's the Lord amen and we'll go from verse just first 10 here whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might and that's it let's pray dear Lord father we come before you Lord God once again this morning not standing in our own strength and certainly not Lord God father I love the passage of scripture where you said you you remember our frame that we're but dust after this flesh we are just dust Lord God and father we're not putting our trust or our faith or our ability or our hopes and in this this body of flesh Lord God Father were trusting you that you would come this morning anoint the word Lord God used these lips Lord God and use our ears father may we pay attention to what you're trying to speak to us this morning Lord God father Lord God if there's any needs Lord God that would be in any heart Lord God I just pray that even if you would take me off course and it's talking about something else Lord God that it would be to minister to someone in their very need exactly to where they are today we're just committed into your hands now father we love you lord we appreciate you father the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen it's good to have Ariel back with us again it's such a treat to have him twice in a row heard him playing it was like oh good praise God so it's nice to see you amen amen I'm just want to comment real quick just during the prayer I thought about this is if you if you hear and this is mainly to the young people if you hear something that God something comes to your heart and your you were just thinking about that you you were just thinking about that you were just pondering it or something strikes in your heart I know for myself I know when God is working on me you're you just feel it you can't there it's stick something sticks your heart don't run from it accept it because you're not gonna get away you are not going to get away it is going to stick with you and it will haunt you it will stay with you no matter what you try to do to get away from it it will absolutely stay with you absolutely so what we're going to talk about and this is a different kind of sermon like I said just a bear with me pray for me it's this has been on my heart for a long time and I've just I'm just trusting God that he'll have his way and that it will be a blessing somehow I don't really know how it's all going to come together but I wanted to take some time and there there's it's kind of a sermon kind of a testimony it's a testimony confession encouragement and exhortation all at the same time just to zoom back and to talk about a little bit of my story and not not I pray afraid so many times like God I'm not here to be self ingratiating or proud I'm not here for sympathy but I feel led to to talk about it to talk about my story and I hope that this speaks to the young people and the old people because we're all young we're all we're all children in our hearts we just get we just our body ages there are some things that you know I look at myself at pictures from when I was a kid and it's like we are we just find guises and masks and we thought we grow of course but there are there are certain characteristics about us that are exactly the same as when you were a child exactly you're not any different you think about the way you thought about things or observed things and those conclusions that you made about the world and about life grow because this is true then this is true then this is true and this is true and if it's correct praise God but if it's wrong it takes the absolute grace of Almighty God to go back and fix that to go back and to take the conclusions we made as a child and to change them say that's not the way it is at all it's not the way it is at all but because of something that happened to us brother branham you had talked about this and they there's a lot of science behind this as well is that you look at someone until they're about seven years old and you'll find out who that person is going to be later in life all of the seeds are there they're all there and those are the things that that manifest later in life and so um young people this is for you too it's with you're paying attention paying attention you might not understand all of it but pay attention you might just get something that catches hold and it will stick with you for the rest of your life not in a haunting way but in a positive way that it will keep you it will guard you it will guide you because you can't let go of it it's got a hold of you so pay attention listen to that um so I wanted to talk about that and then also go into a little bit about the church and the assembly here it's wonderful to see a full congregation here it's so wonderful praise God like this is this is amazing this is amazing so part of my reason for wanting to go into this is to for those of you that are have been here for five years or you know maybe a little bit longer is to zoom back but there's a song called it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost gospel is dripping with blood we have this book because people sacrificed and it's the same thing the only reason why this church is here is because people sacrificed people died in a sense they fought for this place because we believe that God still had something to do here in Minnesota there was still a work to be done and and I just want to peel that layer back to say that for those of you that maybe don't know or don't don't remember it's not a guilt trip it's to say here is the here's of the cross we've been carrying join us here's the mantle here's the vision yeah this is what your forefathers fought for join us don't just come to church don't just don't just show up don't just show up be a part of it who grab hold of it because God wants to move here he wants to move here and he absolutely has and he can and he will he's here today so I'm just gonna take my Liberty and I'm just gonna preach it and we're just bear with me and if I just bear with me if I see eyes gazing over I'm gonna have everyone stand up maybe we'll sing a song and then we're gonna keep going that's just that's the way it is until I feel like God is sunk it in we're gonna go for it praise the Lord so for myself I was five years old when we when we came to this church hey you guys remember this stuff it's it's amazing I remember these were offices there were there were like cubicles and stuff this is an old gas station out here and they had turned it into an insurance agency and we had before this it's a long story but we'll just start there five years old I remember working on this and it I remember seeing what's behind all these walls and like there there's still like rebar and stuff like this if a bomb went off over there we'd actually probably all be fine because these walls are incredibly strong they were designed because it was a gas station that if something happened out there it would withstand some kind of that impact at least as far as my knowledge goes I was a kid so once again that was an assumption that I made as a child like oh these will be fine yeah Jordan's back there shaking his head just kidding five years old and and you know it was a new church you were as exciting all that all that stuff and I remember just just you know being a part of it and we had left a previous assembly where you know at that time I left a lot of my friends as a child that's a big deal you know you're my best friend at the time was in that church and it's and it's like you know what do you do you you pick up and you just try to make new friends and thankfully as a little kid that's pretty easy because every well you know really I'm about the same height okay all right we can play tag I'm probably faster than you so you know and I was here and praise God you know of course dad was the song later then and mom mom did Sunday school which I remember those things and I've said this before is that Sunday school is a big deal I remember those things I remember those things that were taught they absolutely stuck with me and and I just want to commend mom and those that are helping out with that cuz that that is an amazing it's a ministry it's absolutely a ministry and it's a wonderful thing so um then I was when I was 10 I remember this distinctly I was parked back in the sound room on a Wednesday night someone's like hey you can probably do this like just turn this up and do that and back then it's like this has come a long way this has come a long long way that mean that there was like a hole in the wall back there that window wasn't there was just like a small little box window that whole place was just filled with junk and there was these sound boards and like the old video camera and stuff and and we were we were you know we're doing what we could with what we had at the time back in the 1990's kids 1990s this is basically ancient history you you're gonna read about the 90s in your textbook someday it's true yeah there's Seuss before this is before smartphones believe it or not I remember as a kid the first time I went on the Internet I literally do is like wow www dot that's a website I've heard about these isn't that weird that's how old I am so I'm almost 30 praise the Lord so I was 10 years old they parked me in the sound room and and um you know I just did it I enjoyed it I enjoyed being back there and and you know I was just a kid I would goof off back there and you know just pretend that I was you know I'm just you know I do the sound but it's like you're drawing back there you're talking to your friends and all that stuff which I know all you young kids are doing - you know back there and stuff like that and um you know it is what it is but pay attention you know listen I mean you're your kid it's it is what it is um but try to pay attention um I did have a hunger in my heart for God I was baptized I believe at 12 originally and I thought I was gonna go to hell like all the time I was I was just one of those people that like I was like I'm definitely going to hell okay I always had that that feeling of like man I'm a terrible person I'm definitely if anyone's going to hell like man I hope we don't get in a car accident I'm going to hell just stuff like that that hangs around your mind and and I had that and I was baptized at 12 and then um you know just a heart for God but not really knowing you know what to do I tried to be a good a good kid a good Pharisee because until you until you're filled with the Holy Ghost and truly born again that's the best you can give is be got become a good imitator a great Pharisee look at my suit look at my clothes look look at the way that I never swear I never you know any of this stuff that is they are not a Christian no you're not you're a good Pharisee until it comes brother branham said that sheep don't manufacture wool they barrel until you come to the point where it automatically now not to say you don't see God and you're all those stuff all that stuff but it comes out of the desire of your heart where it actually comes out of you not on you when that's the point you have to get to where not because anyone else said it it actually comes out of you and until that point you're not your you're professing it now that's good and that's fine but seek more seek him because there is more so I was a good Pharisee and I was 12 and uh I remember I remember I was back in the sound room and later on I mean this is a couple years went by I was 14 I was sitting back in the sound room and you know my friends the pastors kids Daniel and Josh would sit back there with me and we would talk about video games and stuff like that that you shouldn't talk about in church but we would you know we were sneaking around and looking at you kids no just kidding oh we know what you're doing I'm just kidding um he's I was 14 and I remember we had a security camera back there and I looked back and I saw my friend Daniel sitting back in the back and I knew something was wrong something was wrong and my pastor came up Bruce painter and he stood behind this pulpit I guess I don't know if we had this pulpit then or not but we stood right here and he said that he was resigning he was resigning from the ministry and he hit there was a lot of anger a lot of a lot of different stuff I just remember being devastated absolutely devastated because his kids were my best friends absolute and this is after having lost you know as a kid my other best friends and now here it is it's like wow oh like here we go again that that feeling of just sinking feeling of like everything is about to change and it did there was a lot of conflict lots of in those of you that were here know the story we didn't have a pastor all of a sudden we went from having a pastor to not having a pastor I mean I don't know I think we've had like 35 people that were here at the time something like that I didn't I was 14 I wasn't counting at the time and over the course of time most of them left we had about 12 people here that were consistent were always here sister Christine was here sister Irene was here for the Steve and sister Kelly were here dad was here for the Juan came I on Sundays as well and there was a hole there was a pocket of people that still believed something was going on and we we ended up watching a lot of video services watch Geoff Jenkins from down in Ohio Bertha Lonnie a lot of different people and um we did what we could and I remember I remember um and just bear with me um this is all for a reason gods are you okay everyone okay because this this is personal stuff for me so I'm just going with it because I feel led to just speak on this I don't know how it's all gonna pan out I've prayed like God I don't this is different for me but I feel led to do it so I was um was gonna close that I'm just gonna speak and I'll open that up if I go so that happened and and the birth of a major trial for this assembly and for the people that were a part of this set assembly came about we didn't have a pastor this church did not have a pastor and as a kid I remember dad and I talked about this you know because we talked about moving we were like well should we move should we go somewhere else you know what should we do and I remember and I don't know how on earth God put this in my heart at the time Here I am my best friends now we still saw each other at that time every now and then but there was a lot of friction and brother Bruce like he was a face that will tell you I mean there was some things that happened like where he was like well will accommodate you guys and there was just like all kinds of like as a kid like you feel that pressure like someone does not like you very much and you just feel that it's like what's wrong with me what did I ever do and um and you have that and I remember dad and I were talking and I just said it and I believe that this has come to pass that dad the reason for deserts is so that the plants dig down deep their roots go down deep and they find they find that water they find whatever more shirt they can get and when the rain does come they're ready for it and I believe that that's come about by God's grace this this church that God allowed things to happen in a way to bring about growth bear with me you're still with me okay God allowed things to happen God allowed a major trial to bring about growth this church is a testimony absolutely a testimony I look at you know you look at the Bible David talks often about you know my foes encamped against me you know they've Nash up on me with their teeth basically they're saying you're about to die that's what people said about us you're about to die I remember because I started traveling at some point and I would hear people say oh that church they don't want a pastor that Church is having spiritual one-night stands with ministers coming through that affects you that affects you that is a hard thing to hear as a young person having people say that about your church and I knew that wasn't the truth we did we did we felt led that there was there was something to be done here there was still something to be done and we did we couldn't remember down brought through a lot of um and the trustee is his brother Steve dad brother Kozan they'd bring through a lot of Ministers sit again yes brother Steve brink as well oh yeah praise the Lord I love those guys I got to get down to Arizona and see them again so they finally got sick of the winters praise the Lord um yeah Jordan knows those guys so Orly Steve yeah down in the church there in Phoenix yeah is I'm just sharing it from my side cuz I know brother Steve is gonna have his side dad's gonna dad would have it their own stories about how all this came together but I want to speak at it as it from a young person from from a young person who grew up in the message and how did this happen I lost my friends they ended up when I was 17 and we spent a lot of time we did spend time together between 14 and 17 but when I was 17 they moved to Ohio and that was it I had no friends that was my last friend they were gone all the other youth all of the youth I think we had you know 20 30 people all of them went to the world except one who's married to someone in the Hoffman's church all of them went to the world and I remember him faith and I we had each other we had each other and God allowed that and we became very very close and very strong because it's what do you do what do you do and around that time I remember cuz the painter had left I went to college what a perfect trap what a perfect trap you guys know how it is I know how it is I had no friends my friends had just left and I became incredibly popular you have no idea when I went to college I was home-schooled I never went to high school like with a bunch of other kids and i I was super self-conscious my entire life I always felt like I had to earn people's love like I just the way I'm caught mine I don't know I'm just I always felt like slightly on the outside of the other kids like I remember even as a kid getting on like I was like seven years old and they're all you know saying slangs and I'm just gonna say them because I know you kids well they said slangs for swear words and I'm not gonna okay I'm not gonna say them because I don't want kids to hear it slangs for swear words you know D this and and G this and you know oh my yeah that and it's like I remember as a kid getting on people's case like you shouldn't say that that's a swear word I looked it up it's in the dictionary because it is it's a euphemism for a swear word and it means the exact same thing it's like a watered down version it means the exact same thing and we shouldn't be running around saying those things because why on earth would we want to be cursing everyone everywhere we go why would we do that it's not helpful and and it's it's not right so um but I always felt like an outsider and so here I went to college my first class they gave us an assignment first day first class gave us an assignment and it was to make like a movie poster thinks I studied film and I remember I did I was like oh this is great this is easy like I went and did the assignment because I taught myself Photoshop and stuff before I even went to school and I handed it in and they printed that mount and they put all of them on the wall and they had everyone vote whose was best guess whose was best mine first class first assignment I was the best immediately I was the best and it's like wow I am good at this I am really good at this and I remember at the time making up in my mind like who I had to be in order to succeed I knew who I had to be as like I've got to go all out on this thing but I never missed Church thank God I made up I purposed in my heart to never miss Church I never missed Sunday I never miss Wednesday not one time in college not one time if it was on Wednesday I didn't sign up for the classes I missed I my partner and I we won the state championship for SkillsUSA which is a video competition and I didn't go to the reward ceremony because it was on Sunday I would have missed church and then we went in won nationals so thank God like it it ended up working out so um god I went into college and I became everywhere I went in the video deport like everyone knew who I was oh it's loyal he's the he's number one loyal can probably help you like that's was my reputation of constant I hosted like we had a Friday show one semester that I basically people could direct it and who they wanted as their talent to host it was a thirty minute segment I did it almost every single week because everyone wanted me in their stuff all the time all the time I was always in people's projects because I was really good at it you know or whatever you know it all happened and of course then you have the temptations that come behind it and thank God I was incredibly ignorant to like what was going on but it's like yeah people try to pick you up in college absolutely it happens all the time and it's like thank God like I was blind enough to like oh that's what happened like after it happened oh oh oh that's what they meant like oh yeah I wasn't thinking about that like I mean literally like stuff like that happens and there's those temptations those caught like thank God God made me ignorant not ignorant enough at the time that I didn't you know I just was like really didn't even think about it but but you know you you go through all that stuff and for me it's like I got so consumed you know I took critical thinking where there's a lot of the you know relative truth versus actual truth if they talk about Sodom and Gomorrah and how do we know that they weren't burned with fire for in hospital inhospitable 'no stats that's the theory is that oh well you know they they were cursed because they were wouldn't you know they wouldn't feed the a Jules are they you know all this that's the theory out there and you start to get all this stuff in your head and it's just like this constant you know I took sociology which also liked it like it just it strips down your belief system that's what it does I mean it's it's it's literally designed to do that um and like and I went through that so it's really popular kind of had all this stuff and once again thank God I never miss Church a never miss Church and I'll put that out as an encouragement don't miss Church don't miss Church obviously we have things come up there's there's a cow in the ditch but that's not a habit your cows running in the ditch all the time you need to build a fence around that thing set a boundary set a boundary I'm not gonna go there anymore I'm not gonna do that anymore I'm gonna find a way to not have that happen set a boundary and so I had this happen and I don't know I was all over the place but God got a hold of my life in a way I think in the in the in the because I didn't know like it was not so much that I was here because I was like I'm a fun fire for God it really wasn't I knew that it was true but it was kind of on the sidelines it was kind of on the back burner for me and I remember I was 18 years old and I went down to brother Frank craters church for some missionary meetings with Nate painter and my brother Steven and like it was on a whim they were like hey it was during the summer my summer break like hey you want to go down to tech to Arkansas yeah um thank you Arkansas and it's like when are you going this weekend is like what am I gonna do drop all of my plans is an 18 year old I wasn't doing anything anyways um I was planning on watching a movie but I ended up going and I remember like I remember this distinctly you know driving down and just like who's reconnecting like even just the drive down there it's like it was a blessing to me being with Steven and Nate and um you know I got down there and I remember distinctly the first night brother brother Jonathan Goff preach we've had him here before he's from Texas and I remember distinctly I remember being there and I I knew I wasn't right I knew I wasn't right and I felt like I don't you remember what he preached on like I don't I remember that one of his fingers is cut off like if you look at it like the tip of his finger because he's a construction guy and it's like I remember and I remember him and I loved him and when brother Jonathan and I still are we get along very well I knew it didn't even matter what he was preaching it was the atmosphere you know I'd come from being here where you know we were doing what we could but it's like you know a minister would come through and we'd be watching video services and God brought me out showed me something about myself got me away from the norm put me there I were like it wasn't even a big whopping service it was a few people there wasn't even a big deal but I remember we were sitting there and we were singing after the service knows like I know by the end of this weekend I'm gonna be down at that altar so I might as well go right now in my mind like I just knew it like I was in my conscious I was it was in my I just knew it I'm like I'm gonna go and so I did I'm not gonna wait for something to pull me more than I am NOT gonna wait for the emotions and all that stuff I know I'm not right something's wrong I need to get right and by God's grace like I just let go I went down to the altar and I let go and something happened something happened for me and it's it's not that I became a perfect Christian listen young people pay attention I'm gonna have a sing a song if we're not paying attention this is important it's for a reason I don't I'm sorry God I knew something had gotten ahold of my life if you need to stand up or whatever just go for it if you need to wake yourself up um doesn't bother me um God got ahold of my life it was it was like suddenly something changed in my heart my desire changed my desire changed and then I went into the worst time of my entire life up until that point I college and I went from being super like the top of the world everyone was like you're the you know voted most likely to succeed basically it's like you know and then I graduated college and if this is 2009 this is right after the market crash of Oh a-and the Great Recession and all that stuff and it's like I couldn't find a job to save my life at the time I was interviewing a caribou coffee and I couldn't even get a job there at the time like and and that's just the way it was and I went I just spiraled into this horrible depression and ended up getting to the point where um where I got very addicted to movies thank god I've never done drugs or alcohol any things like that but it's like I lost myself it's like I was trying to just and I remember getting to this point where and this was however long it went where I realized it was a problem the desire of my heart was still there God had locked something in me but I gay I gave myself into all of this because I was hurting because I needed something and I couldn't find it I could I'd I had no friends I know at that time hardly I'd you know I'd hang out with Stephen and his friends sometimes but they were like way older and they're over at a different church and stuff like that and it's like um I was looking for something for communion for fellowship movies it's a proxy relationship you get to experience the joy of friends for two hours and then you unplug and it's like wow my life stinks that's exactly what it is it's exactly what it is now I'm not saying sometimes movies are great and God can use them I've had God speak to me personally through that but it depending on the person and the situation it can totally be every bit as bad as drugs are absolutely it can be and so I remember that like it it dawn like this is a problem but I couldn't stop I couldn't stop I knew I couldn't stop I tried I could not stop I'd watch five or six movies every single day every day every day yeah that's rough yeah I was not good and I remember I ended up going to I ended up going to Winnie youth the tree and long story short dawn came down and it was the weirdest thing for me like coming from here where there was like no one and I'll bring the twins into it cuz it Catherine or Annette ended up coming to church somewhere around this time but I went from having no young people my age to going to a camp or a retreat with 400 young people going from 0 to 400 I was like what like I didn't even know there's this many in the world like let alone at one camp all in one place thank God oh my goodness and God from that time and and I'm I'm gonna skip ahead because I'm taking too long just on these parts but these details but they're for someone sons of God are led by the Spirit of God this is for someone so if it's not for you pray for whoever needs to hear this someone needs to hear this I'm convinced too that someone needs to hear it and I went to camp and I remember it like just powerful preaching surrounded by young people and there's a beautiful thing about young people is that they're not set in their ways yet they're more they're open to receive they're oh and that's why Satan is all what brother Branham taught us this this is why Satan's trying to get them so hard because if they can get locked in you know by the time they're around 25 they're very unlikely to change after that it's much harder to change once you hit around 25 but if God or Satan can get ahold of them yes so young people let God get ahold of you let him get ahold of you let him get ahold of you it's not about it's not about the works we think it's more like laws of nature we think of these things as these are the rules and this is what I have to do and if I'm this then I'm a good Christian if I walk this way if I dress this way while inside we are absolutely torn up because we're not who we are we're telling a lie were not actually living out the truth we're covering ourselves in a garment it's a fig leaf we're covering ourselves in a pharisee achill garment and inside were dying and no one can help us because we look so good we look the part no one can help us and we were so caught up in our own mind that were right yet we feel dead inside God there's a reality to it there's a reality it's not just rule this isn't an organization where we're all coming together just to get you know here's the ten principles of life and you know we're not just here to have have have a form of godliness I can go to Tony Robbins and get that the motivational speaker some of his content is excellent absolutely excellent but if all I'm looking for is 1/2 ways decent life there's a lot better places that I could go to and of course we know that there's no better way to live than the than God's Way but brother branham even said Buddhism is about as good as what we got he literally said that that's a direct quote they just don't have the blood they don't have the blood and there are lots of systems if you're just looking for something on your flesh or a way to you know ten steps to you to um you know a happier life there are plenty of systems out there there are plenty of ways there there are plenty of things that you can do broad is the way but we serve a real God a Living God there's a truth there's a life that goes beyond that there's a life that goes beyond that and God got a hold of my life got and and from that time I'm literally just getting started so if you need to go use the bathroom go use the bathroom this is all laying a foundation if if God got ahold of my life and I remember we were driving back from when he used to treat that year I hadn't even asked God to take away that my addiction for movies out of my heart and we were driving back and we were watching a movie on the laptop and it suddenly dawned on me I don't even want to watch this that what God can do it God can do it and it's this we all have our different poisons it's not that I don't watch at movies ever now it's still different though it's still different and I have my moments maybe a weakness or sometimes where it's fine some movies are great they're there no problem but God changed something for me personally I know that it happened no I was there no one else can convince me otherwise I didn't work it out I didn't go through these like here's how to detox your body and change your interests or whatever it happened and it's the same thing for you if you've got a weakness something that you just can't stay away from give it to God give it to God give it to God and LU and get ahold of him seek ye first the kingdom of God because the key thing here and this is what people don't what people don't understand about themselves and I don't on about others because it's so easy to judge someone when they start to go doing something drinking drugs women or men depending on who how it is all they're trying to do is they're hungry they're trying to satisfy a need and it's not always a need for God it's an actual need they're there they're looking to satisfy on one hand they do try to satisfy the need for God with something and God will will let you keep trying to fill that until you're ready to turn to Him nothing else can satisfy that the need for God but the need for a husband or a wife that's a need and people will try to satisfy it you think about it is we don't satisfy the need for hunger with water it'll help a little bit for a while but in the long run what your body needs is to eat it needs to eat and it's the same thing if we're if we're going to alcohol or drugs or movies or video games or or whatever your poison is everyone gambling there's a need that's driving that there's a need there's a desire there there's something in there that needs to be met either for more of God or for something like love admiration acceptance acceptance you look at it if you strip it back what everyone wants is to be loved and there are multiple ways you look at someone gambling right someone continuously habitually and I have not studied this this is just my kind of freewheeling with it is they wanna they they have they think they can win significant they're like I'm somebody I can win and if I win I'll be loved I'm important look at the prodigal son he had money he went out and was you know doing drugs and going out with I mean that's what he was doing it was living the party lifestyle he had all the friends what does all the friends actually mean what is a bad peer group actually mean you're looking for love you're looking for love seek you first the kingdom seek the true and the bad will fall away you can't just cross your fingers and say I'm not hungry I'm not hungry I'm not hungry I'm not hungry I'm not hungry I'm not hungry you could but it's gonna hurt you in the long run it's going to hurt you taking that need to God and He will guide you to what actually satisfies that need because there is an actual satisfaction behind that praise the Lord so God got ahold of my life and jumping back over to the church now so God got ahold of my life and around the same time Katherine Ornette the twin started coming back to church and and I remember Oh as soon as God started getting ahold of my life I started singing I just knew it I don't know why I just knew it like I'm called the sing I knew it as soon as God got ahold of my life like I'm called the sing and I ended up starting the song lead and dad kind of just started letting me do that more and um I was back in 2008 something like that 2009 I don't remember um when I started song leaning but I remember bear with me let's all stand real quick because I feel like the Energy's going down everybody stand up turn to the person next to say isn't God wonderful all right stretch your arms out praise the Lord Amen praise the Lord isn't this good praise God amen all right let's sing one song real quick isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't jesus my lord wonderful eyes have seen ease have heard what's recorded in God's Word isn't Jesus my lord wonderful all right you can sit back down you can switch seats if you want grab a drink of water go for it amen praise the Lord amen amen praise God praise the Lord so during this time we were down to about 12 people here at the church we're down 12 sometimes in some days we'd might have up to like 15 16 something like that maybe 17 Wow cuz I remember I'd be back in the sound room you know sometimes in I like oh count count like oh but you know we we we persevered we continued to persevere and then I remember I started to lead songs and you know God having this fresh man in my heart's like God's done something with my heart I'm like alright I'm just gonna do this I'm gonna trust God and there's lots of shaky moments of the inning for the Lawrence you're doing great doing just fine doing better than I did when I first started so um you know it's just like you're trying to figure all this stuff out and let God use you and the twins and myself and faith um Katherine ernet which you saw them here last Sunday and I'm just trying to transition into this next part god we started having a prayer meeting just the four of us just the young people we had a prayer meeting and Bible study we'd have it here sometimes we'd go to Caribou sometimes and you know God was working on their hearts and they started coming back to church and the four of us together was like just this little oasis of fellowship as young people like there weren't any other guys I mean John anfinsen my friend he came around for a while Danny Hartnett came around for a while there's a couple other young guys but they were in and out Adam Charbonneau came around he was the most liked with it and then he moved to Iowa you know like you know how hard that was for me when when when Adam moved I was like praise the Lord some fellowship love you buddy I'm moving to Iowa what like what like I've been praying for a friend you know if I'm like 19 by now it's like I've been without friends like I need need someone my age and um you know that that was hard that was very difficult whenever he moved but I had faith and I had the twins and and uh and we you know hung out we spend time to get him we fellowshipped and you know God was getting getting a hold of our hearts and we went to God was putting a desire in our heart as young people because here we are in a church of 12 people by all accounts like if anyone else had come in here and looked at us like it's dead it's just dry and dead and we're just trying to hold on and that's a lot of what it was and and not to not to pass judgment but we'll say from a young person's perspective it's like we're just all hanging in there you know it's just like you're coming in and watching the service and it's like oh man and and you're just just trying to just keep walking on with God but God had done work in my heart and I've been did when he used to treat and I came back and it's like there was a hunger in my heart for more of God and there was a hunger in all of our hearts uh the four of us for God and we just started praying we just started praying more and more and I remember I took and a couple other people from friends that I had met and when he thought treat all across the country it's like now I had some connections across the country but I didn't have any male friends here and you know even to some extent like Kathryn or that were face friends and so it's like it was just you know it's like just trying to hang on to some fellowship and we started from myself and a few other people across the country started praying between camps between years fasting one day a week like let's fast on Thursdays and pray that God will do a real work at retreat again this year and when a youth retreat which those of you that are young people in our 17 and older I highly recommend you go to when youth the treat it's a great camp highly recommended and we prayed and something happened that year you still with me okay this is this is going somewhere and this part is I'm just gonna preach it so um hey when I when I first started here like I said it was 12 people tambourine mom would be on the guitar sometime so everyone up and leaves oh I can keep on preaching it's okay I don't mind I've done it before praise God I'm not saying that you should do that we went to camp wonderful services all that stuff and after camp we had this tradition of meeting a bunch of the young people from camp because you have four or five days that you're just in the word like services all day long and fellowship it's like you just feel so clean then as soon as you left you like oh my goodness you're at Starbucks and you're like oh my eyes you know or my ears like you just have this this like you're so aware of the presence of God and the presence of other spirits that sensitizes you to that and so here we were we'd been praying a lot fasting praying like looking for something from God and looking for something real we had great services and then we after camp we went um we went over to crest Johnson's house who was a sister there that would open up her house and so we had like 50 people descend on this poor woman's house like literally like 50 young people are all talking and just like all kinds of noise and I'm Steven investing actually when that year as well and um and they were engaged they weren't gonna get married um bear with my faith I need your backup on this one just like say say Amen because faith was there faith was there for this and we went there's a real God there's a real God we hear so much theory we hear so much this is what the word says and praise God and God can move but there is a real God there's a real anointing there there is absolutely something beyond this world someone absolutely I'm certain of that because I know I was there I saw it we have 50 of us went over long story short there was 10 of us in this small small room tiny we're like crammed in there we're all just talking about the word talking about God and there was a couple different situations and we ended up praying we just pray I started praying about it you just could feel it the president's the atmosphere that was just charged everyone outside is like playing games and like some of them are talking about God too but it's like it's a party you know people are all young people it's like 20 to 25 years old and we were in there and we're all praying and someone starts speaking in tongues and I'd never heard speaking in tongues before at that point like I had not heard it at all and I was just like ever the whole room blew up as soon as someone started like he just blew literally blew up everyone was screaming I screamed like I never screamed like that in my life it was like I was going through a point where it's like I knew had worked in my heart but I was still so much doubt there was something in my mind even while we were praying that was saying you don't really believe this what if God isn't even real is like there's something sitting on my shoulder just saying you know you this isn't even real like you're not even your you're like it you don't even believe this none of it's true like you know all that same old stuff Hiro was you know praying leading a Bible study and like you know all that like it's still there that never leaves you'll always have something there trying to convince you that you're you're not you're not it you're not it you're definitely going to hell you'll always have something there and Here I am and it's just it the room blew up the literally just it I didn't even know my vocal cords could go there I don't know if it was a spiritual scream or what happened but it's like it just like the whole room blew up and an interpretation didn't come forth that's not really the the point the point is what happened afterwards is all of a sudden it's like you went from this kind of charged room to just an explosion just an absolute explosion and we're all just I I was like I thought I was gonna break the chair underneath me because I was kneeling I just like started smashing it someone started pounding the wall and it's like and the way this room was designed it was it was designed with a false wall and someone someone at some point eventually opened up that wall and like it just spread through the entire rest of the house through the entire rest of the house and it's amazing to tell the Stork seventh told us in so long it's like you almost forget that had happened but I was there I know it happened wasn't just emotions it wasn't just fanaticism something happened something happened God was there and it's just it's spread there's a whole house to the point where it's like you look at the paintings of the old Pentecostal meetings the old revivals and the like you actually look at them I've looked in the like that's exactly what we were like exactly people were praying I mean there was people prophesying people were healed like I know they were healed I've talk to them since them then people were here from allergies we had people healed from earth Rytas we had people um I don't remember all the all of the points but there was multiple points and these are all young people no minister there there was no minister there there was no one there was no music there was no music it was a bunch of kids a bunch of kids that wanted to see God and they were ready the atmosphere was there and when God moved it happened it's struck it's struck and I can't explain it to you because you weren't there I wish I could take people I've wished for the last tenth what was it almost ten years nine years ago now whatever it was that I could take people back there and that's exactly what I've been trying to do I came back from this and it happened it went for five or six hours five or six hours of prayer and people running around and in in laying hands and claiming and confessing sin like you like you can't make it up there were people that were outside I know this guy he's a minister now something got ahold of him too friend of mine um Jared Meade he said he was outside he had gone for a walk he came back and he saw everyone running around he's like oh they're playing games and he goes running in because he thought they're playing games and he said when he went through the doorway it's like he hit a brick wall because his spirit wasn't in line with what was going on in there he hit a brick wall and of course he stood outside and prayed and eventually he entered in and and it was a mighty move of God like six or seven eight ten ministries came out of that all of them might like all of my friends like I know them Chris take was there Zach Wallace was there Nathan Ericson was there I was there Jared mede was there it's a bunch of other guys that are all now carrying this gospel why because they saw something real something beyond our understanding this is beyond theology beyond beyond the rules or the constructs or the do's and dont's are like there was a prophet fifty years ago it was something happening today that was real and we knew it was real we knew it was real something happened and we finally went home you know whatever something like eventually we went home and we went to bed the next morning we went over to Paul off Fontaine's Church literal Life Tabernacle over there in in Ohio Michigan I can't remember there on the border um the next day like almost all of us went imagine taking 50 young people who were just in like this amazing charged atmosphere and then put him in church the next day it blew up again it blew up again we had a five or six hour long service you know how long it felt that long that long I remember looking at the clock when I left I was like it's that late five or six hours long and the prayer like the the deliverance and that church went on to have a revival for like two years of just ongoing like prophesying and speaking in tongues and just ongoing revival I listened to the sermons from there that were coming from there at that time and it was amazing and even to this day they still have speaking in tongues interpretation from the same people that were born out of that absolutely go talk to them absolutely so I remember I came out I had this it was like a fire it was like I remember his like I saw it in my mind it's like I came back here it's like here's a blazing bonfire over here and it's like oh look here I am going all alone back over here no friends other than the twins and faith I'd know like guy for like nothing and I was like I had this fire in my heart like I've seen something real and I looked at us and I was I was song leaning already at that time and it's like well I may not be a minister I may not be a preacher but I can sing this thing I can sing this thing and you guys remember the way it was before you remember when I first started and I came back and I broke tambourines I bloodied my knuckles on this pulpit so many times I bloodied my knuckles on tambourines because I'd seen something real thank you praise God thank you sister Kelly thank you appreciate that that was something living there was something alive and in my heart is that God if you can do it there you can do it here God you can do it here there's a real garden there's a matter the numbers it doesn't matter that the trials are the suffering or the years of God you can do it here you can do it and God I might not be able to bring it but I can create the atmosphere for it and for the last 10 years that's been my heart every time I go up to this pulpit I've never by God's grace I never phoned it in no matter how are the trials of the suffering I was going through it's God you can still move you can do something you can do something I know you can do something it's not about me it's not about how much I can dance in the aisle or we can sing the songs or we can play the music it's God I'm preparing a ground for you I know I know someday like Elijah we're preparing the altar and one day there's going to be a fire that falls I know it I know it there's going to be a fire that falls here get ready for it there's going to be a fire that falls here absolutely if you can believe it if you can receive it if you can grab hold onto it if you can look beyond the flash it has nothing to do with after where we are everything to do with God and we'll serve the same God today this thing is real it's alive God is here since rakesh is dealing with this God will raise her up because he is the same God he's the same God we serve a living God today let the fire fall we serve the same God today [Applause] we serve the same God and that's what I want to impress upon you impress upon you get in the game get in the game get in the game don't just be a spectator get in the game don't just come and wait for a song to happen be the fire of God don't just wait for something to happen let it happen you let it happen let it happen we service all mighty God you can just get your eyes away from you and look to Jesus it has nothing to do with you hallelujah glory man I feel like speaking in tongues man poof man we serve a living God man I want to impress it on you impress it on you it's not a one-man show it's not brother 1 it's not me it's you it's always you get in the game grab hold on it God there must be something I can do must be something I can do must be you know something I believe this now maybe it's just me but I remember we were in this room 10 of us and there was a sister there cheyanne she ended up marrying Nathan my good friend and I believe and this is just me I don't know God will tell he'll understand it better by and by but I remember she was so angry about something like that like that the devil had done something she was pounding the floor with their fists she was so mad so before we went to prayer before like this is before the fire fell and I remember seeing that it's like I believe God was pleased with that she didn't just kind of half-hearted kindness order like oh god you know it's you know you're perfect we'll be done and like it she wasn't just passively she was so in it she was so in it she put herself in that word and it's the same thing today music worship what are we doing we're here to drive out spirits we're here to create an atmosphere that the Lord inhabits the praises of his people David cast spirits off of Saul by music by music that's why we do this that's why we do this the word is the importance absolutely but the reason we praise is to bring him down and to cast Satan out we do that so we can we can we're fighting we're fighting in the trenches and it's not based on how we feel I didn't feel like coming up here and preaching today not at all but I did it standing on God's Word not based on how we feel but because God said so that's the key seeking you should it's you it's you it's always been you you bring it you're the one that brings the anointing it's not it's not and don't mean in a man-made manufacturing I'm gonna make something happen but it's that I'm gonna go and I am going to sing my heart out I'm going to praise my heart out I'm going to worship my heart out because I'm gonna get something from God I don't care if anyone else there does to some extent I'm there to see God and if you can grab hold on that grab hold on that it doesn't matter but you are the revival you are the revival it doesn't matter what the whole rest of the church is doing you are the revival you are the revival and God took four young people that came from those meetings and came here and revived this church this thing was dying and God came and brought it here to give it new life and it's the same God that could do the same today God can God can if he can get a hold of someone let God get a hold of you it's not me it's not brother one don't look to us it's you it's you there's an anointing waiting to fall on someone that will receive it that will act upon it who will act upon it praise the Lord um praise the Lord man this is so I thought of moving to Ohio I almost did I'm just gonna keep going until God stops me cuz I'm I'm just here I almost moved to Ohio around this time because I was like Here I am just like and my heart was there there was peep like my friends like I had this desire and my heart's like I had a need I had a need I was alone in a sense like there was faith in the twins but you know though they were friends and I was their friend but it's just different it's different I didn't have a companion I did not not a true like a bosom friend not here for years years and I remember I was standing back in the back and I pray I was praying I was thinking of moving to Ohio a lot of people said I should and I don't know maybe I have my timeline wrong or whatever but it Here I am praying in my heart God what should I do I don't feel settled in one way or the other what should I do and brother Diggs comes running out from behind this pulpit I was standing where brother Dan is there a little further back and he points me in the face they says don't stop don't quit stay right where you are and you grow where you're planted and I just took that at the time like this is God and that gave me newfound courage like I might I might be having a hard time but I've lived under that I believed under that like we're gonna have church today we're gonna have church tonight we're just going to keep on pressing persevering we're gonna keep on persevering we're gonna keep on pushing because God wants to do something keep growing keep moving and it may not happen this morning may happen next Sunday I don't know but God is here God is doing something and I want to go into something because I still feel led to do it and I don't know it's it's it is what it is and I'm just gonna go into it so here I am having gone through all this being been been in this you know state of just spiritual awakening and all of these different things and you tell me if I need to stop or the one because yeah I see you back there just let me know I'm I'm just going for it I took the clock down I don't know what time it is if you need a drink go get it is you know we we we were there and of course God started bringing people in some people started coming and brother one came and you know he would join our prayer meeting sometimes and things like that and and in like you know there was this this work of God that was happening and then during this time it's like somehow we as young people became pillars in the church we did I was doing this and sound then the twins started doing sound faith who's doing sounds like we were kind of touching everything and we all unlock to the church in the morning like everything it was like you know we're a couple a couple of 20-something kids and I think what happened and this is just this is sharing from my heart so bear with me and and if you need to go go if you need to get a drink of water go I once again I just feel led to go through all of this so got major testimony right I mean all this stuff that's happened and God God God did this but there were still needs and I look at it here we are now and I look at this looking back now as God did use this for a work and that's good and that's right in a like every not complaining at all but we were such a spiritual state and God used us like Elijah and not not comparing ourselves at all like I said that this is not at all to be self aggrandizing to use a fancy word um not to be self patting on our back but that anointing like the Mount Carmel like you know God's using us where our underlying things we just never really dealt with there were things that were just not dealt with because we were still kids still young people we're still mean we were trying to serve God if all of our hearts and God did use us but there were things that were laying dormant and I look at the twins today and it's like I understand I understand because I'm there too for me and and I'm just I'm I'm opening my heart because I feel that it's the right thing to do I think sometimes I've been up here and and as new people have come in people and maybe this is just me but it's like they don't understand they don't understand the years of burden and toil that's come behind this thing you know I've had people and I've one particular person who used to call me while the song service was going on and tell me how terrible it was and how it didn't bless them and all these different things you know you as a young person you just you take it on the chin because you know your hearts right it's like God all I want is to see I've never never gone into any of this to make myself something not to make myself known around the world though I am I didn't go into it for that I went because I wanted to see God move I want and I still want to see God move but I found in myself story of Asaph and i'm just gonna read this Psalm 73 Asaph he's one of the music ministers how ironic one of the music ministers right under David he I mean he wrote a lot quite a few of the Psalms if you look at it he's a prophetic music ministry right here and I'll just read this truly God is good to Israel this is Psalm 73 even as such as are of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well-nigh slipped for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are their play are they plagued like other men than jumping down verily and this is his cry verily I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency for all the day long have I been plagued and chastened every morning if I say I will speak thus behold I shall offend against the generation of thy children when I thought to know this it was too painful for me and like I said this this sermon is testimony confession exhortation and something else I can't remember this is me this is exactly what happened to me and I I think well I think it happens a lot with young people with young people that are their their their heart has been to serve the Lord with all their hearts from the days of their youth and that was me it's like I'll give God everything I have I gave him everything that I had and there and I got to that point where and I don't remember when all this started it's hard to kind of look back but it's like I don't know if I was 25 26 what it was you know the twins got married and then it's just me then faith and you know faith was dating Josiah before and then thank God here comes Jordan and all that stuff and I was alone really alone now really really really alone it's like I've had I have friends all around the world I do I have an open invitation to the Philippines I have the open invitation to multiple like around because and that's not not Tooting a trumpet it's the gift of God God's been blessed to me in that I've been able to make connections around the world I've been to ten countries or something like that and you know I used that because I wanted to go and help and but God also blessed me by making many friends in that regard but they weren't here they weren't here you know you look at this and I think of this as during my formative years it's like 14 years old no pastor friction between what little friends I did have 17 friends finally go it's like since 14 to some extent to now my friendship level has been very I don't know I can't even explain it but it's like that feeling of not really belonging anywhere that that feeling of just isolation it's like no one really understands and even here and I love you guys I really do and brother Stevens helped me with some things Aaron's helped me with things Ariel's helped me with things brother Joseph - we did lunch the other day that or other months sorry if we've been meaning to get back together but it's like there's this longing in my heart there's just this longing there there's a longing in my heart and there had been and yeah if you need to go get water do it this is this is um I don't know it's important there's a reason for all of this I don't know entirely why by God God put it on my heart truly God is good to Israel and I saw this I came to the point when I was 25 26 and it's like something just changed in my heart just I still wanted to see God I still wanted to serve God I still want all those things but a Burt our desire started growing more and more in my heart as God what about me you know I saw my friends starting to get married starting you know getting great careers or you know things like that it's like what about me I've served you I gave everything I had to this thing everything I had to this thing praying like studying the word like I did and that's not not at all to be like hey guys feel bad for me or look at me not at all that's not the point I'm this is more confession than anything else that I found in my heart a mixture of desire but I had to start fighting off a sense of bitterness of like I've worked so hard in God what's what where's the where's the blessing in all this what where is it where is the revival where where is it and then for me it's like God like I just feel behind I feel behind all of my peers and and I know I know that I went through it's literally this exact trial where I started looking at the world is look at the success look at this you know if I'd gone back and gotten my master's degree you know where would I be I'm a smart guy like I could have done this I could have done this but it's like God but I did this for you and that's not wrong except that it started going more and more into like this inner festering but I took that to God in prayer and I prayed and prayed and prayed for about two years and just praying that I found myself in the scripture it's it's it's are you still with me okay and and I'm just sharing this I don't know maybe it will help someone and maybe it won't but it's it's I've been in this church for almost 25 years that's pretty crazy that it's been a long ride a long long time I've seen a lot of faces come and go and that was very hard seeing John come and go seeing Danny Hartnett I love that guy I love that guy to pieces and they come and go it's like this constant like crate finally like ah yes this is gonna be great like I got along great with those guys but they're not they're not Christians they don't serve the Lord they don't love the Lord even though like there was a point where like yeah the God baptized and but they don't it's not there it's not really there and um I started praying more and more and more and I found myself in the word thank God you know I'm Hannah God give me my blessing you know I'm give me my blessing I've served you I've served you I've been there I've served like I've been there you know I I didn't you can't lay a finger on on me not doing it because I did I know that I did even going to the Philippines which it's a complicated story around that but I went because I felt led I wasn't preaching it I sang probably 50 times at other churches um III haven't been I've tried to follow God to the best of my ability with all of my heart not to say I don't have my own mistakes cuz I do we all have weaknesses we all have tendencies but I did that I started finding this in my heart and three years ago I had had an experience and brother one and I have talked about a lot of the stuff we had been I love were the one and we've I love that we both worked at align it together because as soon as he moved here I was working at Allina it's like or something they were like that and so we got to spend a lot of time together and so I've enjoyed that a lot and that I know him we know each other it's not just like I'm just like one of the rant like I get to know him don't take up all of his time but get to know him because it's it's I love that as a young person kind of coming up I've had that relationship to be able to come talk to him about things and I think I've probably been more more open than he was expecting because it's like hey this is what's going on here's my terrible troubles and and stuff like that but um God told me he was going to build my house now I I don't like to say God told me unless I'm very very certain it's like God told me I know it was and it was like an it was an answer to prayer it was an it was a direct answer to prayers like I'd be prayed for years and I made a mistake I'll build your house but it says unless the Lord builds the house they labor in vain that build it and that's the mistake I made I made a mistake I took I'll build your house and I I took it as it's time for me to build my house and it was wrong and um it was wrong and not that I haven't still been serving God and things like that but I can see now that because of that I never fully dealt with the relief from that burden and that bird it kept growing this inner resentment and bitterness in my heart like when's it gonna happen when why is why is this like this and and I'm just being totally open and honest so um most of you know Sarah my former girlfriend we broke up in January and this is not a breakup story but it's it's that shocked me it shocked me because I knew God had told me he would build my house and it it it it broke me literally just broke me not just a broken heart like a standard like oh wow poor me like like like that it actually broke me like literally broke my trust and God like broke my my what happened like where did I miss you God what's going on it broke my my I've been to the bottom I've been to the absolute bottom I'm very very thankful to God to be standing here right now very thankful very very thankful and I know that I know people different people have commented and looked back over the last nine months and been like wow I can tell because I've been weird some things have been like strange and and the first I'm just glad to be here and I I appreciate everyone's prayers if anyone is praying for me because I I'm very glad to be here very thankful to God praise the Lord thank you thank you for your prayer someone was praying for me praise the Lord Amen brother Dan praise God amen thank you thank you I needed it and I I appreciate your prayers and and I do still need your prayers see there was a reason for all of this to bring it around you know this is this is my story it's a story in the making and it did it brought me broke you know here it is and now you know my story you know my background you know what I've been through my best friend from growing up is gay he's married to a guy yeah that was that that was really like there's been hard hard hard things in life and then you know coming to this point where it's like God like I thought I was about to turn a corner into a new chapter of life like you know I'm ready I'm ready to turn that corner and it's just like everything turned to mud in a second every and this is I'm just being open and honest and I don't know if this is going out on YouTube or whatever but I'm just I'm this is my church and I'm talking to my church and my family and I'm being vulnerable and honest I'm just telling the truth and hopefully this helps someone like the show the weakness of the strong like this this is my this has been my burden and my hurt and the difficult but in the space of oh of about a week's time broken up with accepted a new job was let go from my previous job like in the space of a week was like boom boom boom oh and then our dog died boom like boom and it's like in one instance and I knew it like I saw it as soon as it happened thank God it's like something is happening I knew it like God is here somewhere because this does not happen by accident there's too many things going on all at once is too much - it is this is a test something about this is a test but I couldn't see God I couldn't find him I like I tried to see God I looked for him I was Joe I wish God had a house that I could go and knock on his door and find him find him you know and yet in spite of all this and I appreciate everyone's patience with me cuz I know I don't always show up for service in time I don't because of this like my heart has just been like I had to drag myself to church make myself go to church because my heart was so hurt not against Sarah against God why is this happening why did you let this happen what is going on why didn't you show me it why didn't you let me know is gonna come what what is going on I just had to make myself come to church and I'll say it again come to church get to church if you've got to drag yourself by your fingernails to the door and sit in the back or sit back there get yourself to church find a way to make it happen get yourself to church honestly like I believe that kept me because I'm a like I'm a like even if I was like halfway through the song service or like barely here or whatever it's like I came I still came I still came by God's grace because I know that it's right I've been through it even in these last nine months and I'm just sharing this I'm and it's from my heart I know some people are tired and some things but it's like we all will go through this no matter how strong you are we all go through we'll go through times where we feel lost God's abandoned us and we'll go through man again and again and again and again it will keep going through them because it's it and I can say it now Jesus told us you would never leave us or forsake us and the reason he told us is because we would have times where we thought that he had that's why that's why and I've been through that I've been through the stripping down of my total belief of everything where it's like I don't know what's what I don't even know which way is up because what happens is when when you have something totally unexpected that challenges your belief not just like oh look someone's an atheist is gonna come and try to talk me out of Christianity but it's something that you believed to be true and all of a sudden you find out that it's not it shakes everything you know you it would be like saying like if some if all of a sudden you realize that the Sun didn't exist well then what about your conceptions about plants because the photosynthesis and they interact with the Sun and it's all of that that web of beliefs we have those we have all of these beliefs that are interconnected and so when one is broken the rest come into question because they're all connected and so for me like uh and not not to go into too much detail but it's like I've been there I've been to the point where it's like absolute rock bottom not knowing which way was up like what like god I'm just crying out to you cuz I don't know what else to do I don't even know if you're listening to me I don't know if you hear me I don't know if I did something wrong I don't know if I don't know I just don't know all I can do is cry out that's it all I can do is cry out and I I guess I want to say this you know to to those that have struggled or those that have been out of church or back in church or whatever or maybe you're dealing with something right now you've got a temptation you've got a whatever the compassion in my heart for you has never been greater never been greater I love you were the one we all have needs we all have needs like we all have needs I look at Josh my best friend Josh growing up pastor's son now he's gay all that stuff he had needs he had needs we all have needs and Satan will come in and in the season of waiting on God he'll give you what you need he'll give you what you need Satan will come in and and give you that substitute give you that it looks so good look so perfect it looks just right we have to be paying attention have to be paying attention and that's finally I found a leak of light and that was actually what it is pay attention before brother 1 started preaching this series on pay attention those of you that were here remember he's preached all these sermons on pay attention right before that I had a dream and because of the dream I started thinking it was like a haunting pay attention pay attention pay attention and then all of a sudden he starts preaching pay attention I was like okay god I'm paying attention I don't know what I'm supposed to be paying attention to I don't know like I don't know where you are I can't see you I'm trying I know you're here somewhere but I'm trying with all of my heart to pay attention and he's trying like everything just keep on paying attention except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it compared with me no matter what temptation you're going through in the last nine months I've probably been there probably been there like it's amazing how Satan will come and use your emotions and work it it's like I didn't get a full sleeve of tattoos that's good that's it's good that that didn't happen half the reason why was because I didn't you know like oh look where did that come from I didn't know um but really and I want to make a point here again cuz this is important bear with me I am sort of I think I'm coming to a close I don't know God God do what you want to do Here I am and God can still use me he did we had great song services I took some time off and I had brother Lawrence doing it for a while because I I needed that space but we still whenever I led songs why cuz it's just yielding to God has nothing to do with me and I once again I want to impress it on you get a hold of God yield to God it's beyond it's beyond this guy God can still move no matter where we are no matter if we're having this this in like little the greatest trial of my life I thought I've had trials worse like before but like now I've had it it's like wow this is this was rough it's not even people people have talked to me it's like it's not even just about a breakup because a breakup you were like okay get over it like it's fine you'll find someone else it's the surrounding circumstances and the surrounding years of like connections and like it's it's what it meant it's not what it was it's what it meant it's what it was connected to years of prayer and years of sacrifice and following the leadership of the Lord fought like to the best of my ability trying to follow the leadership of the Lord and it's like God like I don't understand like I don't understand how did you lead me here what happened but we have to sons of God are led by the Spirit of God and I've come to the point where I I prefer sit and I believe it I still have my days where it's it's rough I had one yesterday I dug myself out thank God but it's it's going to the word and truly accepting and believing the word beyond our feelings beyond what we see or what we think we have to accept the word God said sons of God are led by the Spirit of God God said he'd never lead us leave us or forsake us God said he's Jehovah Jireh our provider he said that and it's it's becoming more real to me and I'm honestly I'm probably gonna get tested on this tomorrow it always happens so pray for me like it does brother one knows this like you preach something and at least for me like for me I preach something I immediately get tested on it almost happens every single time it's so it you have to be careful not to fall into while I don't want to preach that because I don't want to get tested on it it happens like I have to catch myself it's like well I'm already getting tested on this anyway so might as well preach it praise God just wanna expose the devil as much as possible amen just want to expose the devil amen amen yeah but it praise God bear with me are you still okay like I'm okay I didn't see that many hands everybody raise your hands praise the Lord oh is it hey a second session oh no I'm almost done I think I'm okay I am almost done um I'm sorry I don't have no clue what time it is let's see hey you will preach this late all the time that's what I'm gonna do next time I'm just gonna come up beside hey brother we might need a second session I'm sorry I'm just teasing a little bit um I'll let you guys go pretty quick pretty good I'm sorry um I've come to I had a breakthrough and I'm just gonna say it there's a lot more that I feel like I would like like it just is what it is and I'm going to I'm just gonna go into it I had a breakthrough I hit rock bottom again like the darkest clothes like just I've been to the absolute bottom I'm so glad I didn't start drinking thank God it could have happened it could have happened because when you're so out of yourself you're just looking for something anything to satisfy that need anything anything to just take the edge off to help you escape from the pain from the torment from the hurt well just like and when you feel like you can't get ahold of God where do you go where do you go that's hard it is hard man oh it's difficult but I cried out to God and I finally found I don't know a form of rest in um no I'm gonna read you something I found a form of rest in simply crying out David talked about in the Psalms over and over and over you look at the Psalms there David crying out to God and sometimes we and it's good we ought to UM profess faith and those things are right stand upon God's word but sometimes it's letting go it's letting go in the god I don't even know what to say but I know you understand my heart that I'm just I'm bro can I don't even know I don't know what to say I don't know it's real I don't know I don't know what but I know there is a God I know there is a God God help me help me that's all I could pray God help me that's it and I came to that point where it's like that would the end of my rope the end of the end of being able to find something to pray other than God help me help me and um I can't find it I mean I won't read it right now but I've only had this happen twice in my life two times ever where it's like I was writing and all of a sudden something just came out on the page and it was perfect it was perfect it was inspired and it was exactly what I needed to hear and it was it was about fighting and I can't find it right now so I won't read it but it's it doesn't matter how dark it gets I'm going to fight I'm going to fight it doesn't matter I better find it um because this is important I feel led to go into this so bear with me I'm coming into a close 15 more minutes can I have 15 more minutes please okay really quick before I read this I'll share this quote that I found that is really really helped me from is anything too hard for the Lord you know sometimes when things are going wrong dark we know by nature that it's darkest just before day and many times when we see disastrous things happening like that especially to believers we must bear this in our mind that it's Satan trying to block the blessing that's on its Road amen we're taught in the scriptures that all things work together for good to them that love and no matter how bad it seems remember it has to be working for your good so I'm glad of that I'm glad of that amen and as soon as you get a little scared well maybe I haven't done this and that I haven't done that right then Satan's got that blessing conquered for you you can't get to it as long as Satan makes you think that and perhaps if we would listen to such things of temptation like that and would pay attention to them it would be that we would miss the blessing pay attention oh there's the last part as soon as you get a little scared well maybe I haven't done this and I haven't done that right then maybe you did something wrong as soon as you start to get a little scared Satan's got that blessing conquered for you you can't get to it as long as Satan makes you think that and perhaps if we would listen to such things of temptations like that and would pay attention to them then it would be that we would miss the blessing don't pay attention to the Giant pay attention to the sling pay attention to the sling pay attention to the sling because things yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me the importance is on that God is with me God is with me yes praise the Lord amen God is with me and that's the comfort that I finally I I'm still in it I'm in the thick of the fight but I know God is with me I know he's with me and it has to work out for my good I don't know what will happen in my life I don't I don't know what the future hold on I tend to be kind of a forward thinking like introspective like planning type whatever and I finally come to the point where it's like that's changed it's changed its that I don't know what the future holds I don't know we can plan things so well and calculate them out and it's like my hope has to be in God my hope and my trust has to be in God um and in God I'm gonna read this I'm just gonna read it the it's personal but I believe this was inspired there's only one other time and brother 1 no I remember this cuz I read the last one here and it came to me and maybe this can help someone else I I don't know it came to me and it is what it is I'm wrapping up I'm coming to a close you can put the clock back up if you want this is my sorrow this is my cross every day I raise up and I pick up my cross and I bear it empty broken hopeless and I get up not because I believe that things will get better not because I have any hope for a survival but because I don't know what else to do so I get up I get up and I fight I fight one more day bear with me because there there's there's a meaning there's a message behind this maybe today will be the last maybe I won't hurt tomorrow maybe it will all be over and I won't have to suffer anymore maybe a ray of sunshine will strike my face today and but for a moment I will feel its warmth maybe I won't die after all or maybe I will but I fight that is all I can do I fight day in day out in the darkness I fight I fight because I can do no other I fight not because I am brave I fight because I am afraid more afraid to stop fighting than I am to fight I fight not to win but to fight with no hope of survival but the aim to die with my boots on my sword in my hand I fight and bear with me this is strange there's a message and I'll say it at the end my name is loyal and I will fight not because there is some reward not so others can see not because I expect something or because of what I will be I will fight because there is nothing more I can do I fight because that is what I choose to do I fight sword in hand armor on broken and worn bloodied and torn I fight I fight I fight though I'm trampled muddied pushed down I fight I fight I fight I will fight I will fight as if it is my last I will fight because it is my last I will fight I will fight I will fight I will not quit I will never give up I will not be one of those downtrodden few who cower and quiver I will fight I may not win but I will make my mark I will stand I will get back up I will not stop I may cry and swear and curse the face but I will fight I will fight I will never give up now this is strange it's strange but it broke something for me and there's there's a victory in this there's a victory in this it's accepting and there's there's something in this yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death this is my cross it's not about serving God just for an outcome no matter what happens though he slays me yet I'll serve Him that was this point for me that's when this hit that no matter what happens I'll fight I'm not letting Satan take me with without my boots on I'm going to fight I'm going to fight I'm going to fight I'm going to fight and I read that as an encouragement to each of us you've got something we all do we've got something in our lives that Satan's working on us right now everyone does fight fight fight pick up the sword and fight him for it make him at least try have to try don't roll on your back let him take it fight fight is not even with the hope to win but to fight that I'm not going to let you take my land without me fighting for it that's it that's it I'm going to fight yes sir yes amen yes sir amen amen to fight amen yes to fight to fight to fight you look at um I can't even remember who it was now um had the rod of brass 600 Philistines were coming to take the harvest Shamgar he was not hoping to win but he just had enough he just had enough of it and he decided he was going to fight that's it so if you've got something in your life you are tired of Satan coming and taking it away from you taking away your joy taking away your peace taking away your hope taking away your faith don't let him have it you might not win but at least fight fight every day get up and fight fight fight fight because God is on your side God is on your side brother Branham said that I might pray for a thousand people today and they all died and tomorrow I'll come back and pray for another thousand because it is not up to me to make God's Word real or God's Word true it is up to God it's my job to take that sword of the word in a strong hand of faith and simply fight that's my job and that's your job - it's the same thing with this assembly it's only God that can bring the revival but is your job to fight when they went to take over the the promised land God said I will I will it's yours I'm gonna take it I'm gonna go with you I'm gonna go before you all these things but they had to fight and we're in the same place today we have to fight how many's ready to fight amen praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord counting on that counting on that I'm leaving God is calling me out of Minnesota and I'm counting on that to someone to pick up and it's not me for the Lawrence is doing a great job up here singing but what we need is a is an anointing we need the anointing to fall I look at an aerial you go where God leads you Aaron Joseph brother Steven each one of you we're looking for an anointing of God to fall to lead this thing beyond and brother ones obviously got gods he's got the vision every joint supplieth every joint supplieth and I'm I'm leaving Minnesota and I've prayed about it for a long long time and I know that it's right and I know that it's true and and after that God showed me something finally for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of prayer that he's been calling me out for a very long time a very long time and I didn't go I didn't follow the voice of God and God wants this church to grow and someone else to stand here other than me I believe that with all of my heart there are someone or people here that God wants to anoint to take thing forward into the next step I believe that with all of my heart absolutely and I don't know who it is I'm not I'm not I point you guys out because your other young guys and God wants to use us you know it's not it shouldn't just be MA and I know there's other sisters helping mom back there God is it's not a one-man show this isn't this isn't the first Church of loyal and brother one and sister Naomi and Ariel and you know this isn't it's a many membered body of Christ and this is God's church this is God's church and there's gone is is ready to do something he's about to do something I believe it and I don't know maybe he wants me away for a bit and then I'll come back or something but I see it I see the handwriting on the wall for me and God wants someone else to step up part of the reason for the service fight get ready to step up get ready to fight come join in this join in in this get in the game get in the game I'm sorry I kept you guys too long um there is room for more there's plenty of swords to go around there's room it's so easy to look at the next person over and say well they'll take care of it or that you know get in the fight do something find something that you can do I love you guys I love you guys so much I love this church I love what God is doing here and it seems so anticlimactic like here's my big trial and then I'm leaving I'm sorry I I didn't want to like if this has been the most difficult sermon ever to preach because it's it's it's my life and there's a chapter closing and I don't know what's going to happen this is the first time in my life where it's like I am literally stepping out on faith because I believe with all of my heart that God is leading me out all of my heart and there's a reason for that I it started a while ago and I stayed because I don't want to see this thing fail III believe God wants to do something here so I know he does I know he will and it took me being able to see that it's not about me someone else can do it it's not me it's not it's not me this whole anointing that comes it's not me it's God it's God God is here I believe that with all my heart that God is here and that he is doing a work and you can see it looking around um I'm sorry this is this is all very personal but um I love this church I look we've got a great we've got something great here guys I've traveled around the world ministers from everywhere said that there's something special here that's not to be patting ourselves on the back we've got a great a beautiful worship a beautiful worship a beautiful praise and God comes down don't miss it don't miss it make use of it get a hold of it get a hold of God God wants to move God wants to use you God wants to do something wants to take you to the next level the next level of faith the next level of pray the next level of worship let's not rest on our laurels and say wow isn't it great that we have this or we have that or let's go to the next level let's keep moving forward with God amen praise the Lord I don't really know how to close this thing to be honest um I just I can't close it [Applause] praise the Lord you see when I was telling the Lord to have another session it was not because of the time I didn't want him to be battle of keeping you long and skip some of the things that he wanted to say it was not because of the time and you know people who not understand you know how God leads a man for a matter of fact you know we come here we think and pour ourselves in the presence of the Lord the day it please the Lord and you know and he captures in an atmosphere of worship we were just saying if that's what what he want us to do that just exactly what we were going to do we're going to just follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit you know I don't believe that we have an impression machine here where we you know just put on and just preaching just preaching just bridge and most uh many of us even even with the Deacons you know the period of time I've had to say to sit with them and and talk to them and and and there are some things I would not you know I'm not obligated to come out and just tell you everything from the onset you know people are led in different ways the way they do you know the way they are caught in their ministry and I'm different like from as you know somebody else could be different from me and just like brother Lloyd said if I go back in his testimony I will tell you that I saw when he came from they came from those prayer meetings you know there was one one Sunday I mean came from their youth came one Sunday I came to service and butter scalp was waiting for me right to the door because Lord started praying and he was he just broke out in the spirit it was time to leave sons he just kept praying and kept praying and kept praying so he met me at a song door at the front door I said well the law won't stop praying praise the Lord at least he was praying amen and you know and and it's all because sometimes we get caught up in in the traditional ways that we do things and we think that if we step out a little bit like like this service you know people who George the service and and says well you know how can you take people time and say all of this well to them that you know God use the service of blessed blessed be your heart to death to those that are offended at the service may God help you praise the Lord because I don't take my detects from man I don't care whatever it is praise the Lord if I never felt led for the service to be like this I was a no matter how how much law was burden on his heart to say I will not have done it but I just felt it's the right time amen and I was blessed by every bit of it praise the Lord and as he to tell you a little bit of the history of the church and I walk right into this into this assembly the first time sat right back there and and then after a few services I believe it was sister faith that came to me one service and she said but one do you mind visiting us at our Bible study I said well okay I will you know and then I went in there one one just before church and these young people will meet an hour before church service was 10 o'clock they will meet 9 o clock spend an hour in Bible studies and prayer meeting even before the service when they don't even have a pastor and that was one of the thing that kept me in many soda those young people I knew there was something you know it's net is net it's not normal to see you know this net is not an ordinary thing to just see young people wanting to serve God wanting to do what is right when they don't even have a pastor it's easy for young people to move to other church what they can have friends where they can have a pastor and have somebody to be responsible I left from that prayer meeting Bible studies that they in and I just I just said lord I don't know but I could just feel it I can feel that these young people have a heart they want to know God because they will ask you every question in the book you know and then I just want to say take what you say because you know you are a preacher you know and you know and you answer one question and then we will counter it with another thought but what's about this and then what's about the adding and and then over over the period of time you know I mean the Lord just did it I mean Lord kind of all fed on a mine on my wings as a friend you know the brother and I will not hold back to say as a son we talk and for people that would come around they were always think that maybe he has an extra privilege no there is nobody that hasn't have an extra privilege the thing that is that I believe that he's been able to understand what I'm doing praise the Lord when we started having live ministry in the church we asked all the other brothers to leave the sound room we turn it over to these young people that was birdie too you know to lead a song sound and everything and we just we just handle handle there is the spiritual responsibility over to them because that's their as the people I saw had a burden there the elderly people were there as supporters but these were the young people that had the burden praise the Lord you know so I mean he was just he was just everything he was just everything praise the Lord I will ask him to do and you know according and sometimes I would have to join him you know so he can he can feel like I'm punishing him and you know who come out of the speaker works and different things who do and but the reason why is because I was I wanted him to honest in what I'm doing you know I want him to understand you know my mind my ways of doing things sometimes you would talk so no no brother or any you know person have you know a kind of a special privilege and they are seeing the different things that he was dealing with I know to the Deacons it was strange you know because I know a few times they would come to me and I would just tell him okay let's do this you talk to this person go to her brother Scott to leader sons and in and out of there praise the Lord I think I preached this before and that is the way with many of our young people many of these young people just like Abraham and Isaac the law of that I have for the appearance made them to follow the appearance to the mountain to go in sacrifice and there was what Isaac did he was excited trying to be an obedient son just because the parent want to make a sacrifice you can see high everything tie in there God spoke to Abraham he never spoke to Isaac he spoke to Abraham if you love me then sacrifice your son to me and let innocent Isaac following his father not knowing that he was a sacrifice so is Abraham proving his love to God praise the Lord but then when Abraham relate the story to Isaac and Isaac got the revelation of it he was able to also submit himself to have that to be done praise the Lord if there were things and you know you know if I had to and you know just like that you know and just like I said I came in I mean law was I mean he was whipping before this also crying and I just came behind the pulpit I started leading songs he knew that you know the order has changed he went out of faith well maybe some expected that I would have preached the same on about him he was not doing anything wrong there was nothing that he was doing wrong he might look wrong in your eyes but it was not wrong yes yes young man they're pouring out his heart to was God I could have been like Eli talking to Hannah praise Lord amen so just like all of these young people some of them has come alone some have come to understand me some has net amen and and and even now when when it when it comes to death you know when when it gets to the place where is a young brother or maybe the young sister we're trying to work with you know and whenever it gets to the place were you know like like brother branham said in leadership we have to find our place you know there is a place word the young people must come on the leadership of the ministry and some of the dangerous thing is there is a lot of parental interference when parents want to feel that this is my child and why you want to do this to my child and what you want to do this to my child then you will be hindering their child from that time from that position of work you know the Holy Spirit must be leading him talk you know Lord and that's the reason why we relate to what we relate brother Ben call me in the other morning and you know this this security camera will always show musicians you can come up this security camera will always show anytime there was some motion after the Wednesday service I feel appreciate out of my heart and he wanted to talk to me we sat down right here until almost 4:00 a.m. in the morning talking we were crying we were praying we would get back to talking you know but bench verb and said my phone keeps sending me you know buzzes and when I look you people were sitting down up I said we were just having to all-night service praise the Lord you know there was one time Lord came and told me he was going to go to he was thinking about he was thinking about I think his office sending him to North Carolina and it looks like he came as a surprise when he told me about it I said go for it he said really I never thought that you used you want me to go and there are a lot of personal things we talked about I won't want to say some of those things but I felt in my heart that it was it was time for him to go he never saw it that time and but even out of this time when he was going through all of that I prayed I cried I was just telling him the last time we were talking I said I saw it when the Lord brought him through it I saw it I knew that we there was a light at the end of the tunnel look I've been preaching since I was 18 years old this is my life I put my life into what I'm doing I put my life into it it's part of my life and the thing that is hard for a preacher is that he's not only burdened with your life it's almost like he's living part of your life that is the thing that is high for the preacher if you ask me personally you know if I will one brother law to go out I would say no one because it is somebody that that I understand you understand me in a lot and he feel free with me he can come and pour out his heart and I was just setting my chair for my hands and he would talk and talk and he will cry he would say I'm sorry and you'll be talking out you say Lord you just got to help us give me something to say to this young man and you were talking told said I don't want to take all your time I said take all the time you have praise the Lord and I want to say to all of you young people when we come in you know talking to you people no matter how I might say things to you it's with the heart of love praise the Lord and I pray that the Lord will help all of our young people to have a personal experience to be able to get hold of God it's not something that you know it's not a flower bag of ease we're going to have challenges and have challenges and I mean some of the brothers aaron has got used to me Ariel you know Joel you always try to run away from me and I'll call him set him down and talk to him because the thing about young people gets to a certain place we start to look for our personal identification you know and there could make us run into different things but you have to know that there are people I've been praying for you amen it's cool to see Josh was sitting there in a red suit I drove with him the other day and going to drop sister and jacket home and we were coming back and I reminded him something that he couldn't remember we were having a prayer meeting one time and he asked me a question he asked a question and you know and sometimes his mother would think that all these children are coming up with too much question and he asks a question and that question stuck on my mind and it had me to study something you remember when I was talking about golf passing and when Moses was in the cliff of the rock and the strange thing about it there is that I thought about that for many years steady on it for many years and they were preach it until recently when I appreciated so I was reminding him that that that give me an inspiration so that's the reason why I believe all that the father has given to me I can say that personally because I know I'm a son of God I mean all that the father has given to me I will come praise Allah amen and if God bless us and keep us faithful to him we will present them to him because he gave them to us let us worship the law [Music] in across e their cross oh yes e the cross be my glory [Music] till my Roger sous-chef fine rest beyond the river in the cross the cross oh
