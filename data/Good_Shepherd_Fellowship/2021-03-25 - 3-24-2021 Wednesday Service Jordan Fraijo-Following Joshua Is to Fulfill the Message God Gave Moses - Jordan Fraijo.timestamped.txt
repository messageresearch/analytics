[46:32] let's just go ahead and jump right into
[46:34] the scriptures here musicians
[46:36] thank you being on wednesday night we'll
[46:38] just
[46:39] jump right in that way we can get you
[46:41] out in a reasonable hour
[46:43] [Music]
[46:45] if you'll turn with me to the book of
[46:47] joshua
[46:49] chapter 1 1-8 i have
[46:53] quite a few pages and notes here so you
[46:55] just
[46:56] be in prayer here that i don't need to
[46:58] use them all and we'll get out as quick
[47:00] as we can
[47:02] i have a thought here i'm a little
[47:06] nervous so i'm talking fast
[47:08] all right that i want to look into
[47:12] and i want to look into following joshua
[47:16] is to fulfill the message god gave moses
[47:20] and maybe as a sub-context
[47:23] is that
[47:27] in all of it here was just jehovah
[47:30] fulfilling his promises to abraham
[47:34] now that may sound like all things that
[47:36] have happened in the past
[47:38] or an old testament or old testament
[47:40] thing
[47:41] something that's in the bygones but we
[47:43] know jesus christ is the same yesterday
[47:46] today and forever and we had a prophet
[47:48] come in this day
[47:49] who said he was a typologist and he took
[47:51] us both back into nature and back into
[47:53] scripture and he said you have to be
[47:54] able to follow it from genesis
[47:56] to revelation and see where god did it
[47:58] the same way over
[48:00] and over and over again and that way you
[48:02] can place yourself
[48:03] in the word and find out where you're at
[48:06] in that cycle god has you in
[48:08] all right joshua 1 uh 1-8 and we're
[48:12] going to read quickly
[48:14] now after the death of moses the servant
[48:16] of the lord
[48:17] it came to pass that the lord spake unto
[48:19] joshua the son of nun
[48:21] moses is minister saying moses my
[48:24] servant
[48:25] is dead now therefore arise go over this
[48:29] jordan thou and all this people unto the
[48:32] land which i do give
[48:33] to them even to the children of israel
[48:37] every place that the soul of your foot
[48:38] shall tread upon that have i given unto
[48:41] you as i said unto moses
[48:43] for from the wilderness and this lebanon
[48:46] even unto the great river the river
[48:47] euphrates
[48:48] all the land of the hittites and unto
[48:50] the great sea toward the going down of
[48:52] the sun shall be your coast
[48:54] there shall not any man be able to stand
[48:57] before thee
[48:58] all the days of thy life as i was with
[49:00] moses
[49:01] so shall i be with thee i will not fail
[49:04] thee nor forsake thee
[49:05] be strong and of a good courage for unto
[49:09] this people shalt thou divide for an
[49:11] inheritance the land which i swear unto
[49:13] their fathers to give them
[49:14] only be thou strong and very courageous
[49:18] that thou mayest observed to do
[49:20] according to all the law
[49:21] which moses my servant commanded thee
[49:24] turn not
[49:25] from it to the right hand nor to the
[49:27] left that thou mayest prosper withers
[49:30] whoever they'll go is
[49:31] this book of the law shall not depart
[49:33] out of thy mouth
[49:34] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[49:37] night
[49:38] that thou mayest observe to do according
[49:40] to all that is written therein
[49:42] for then shalt
[49:47] for then thou shalt make thy way
[49:48] prosperous and then thou shalt have
[49:51] good success let's just pray heavenly
[49:54] father lord we just want to take these
[49:57] few scriptures and notes and thoughts
[49:59] lord and surrender them all to you
[50:01] lord if it's something you desire to use
[50:03] to be a blessing to your people then so
[50:05] be it and if not lord
[50:06] then we're just a vessel in your use
[50:09] father i ask you bless your people
[50:11] and have your way in this service we
[50:13] pray in jesus name
[50:14] amen you may be seated
[50:17] now we know that
[50:21] according to the message of the hour
[50:22] we've come to a point in place where we
[50:24] are in a position brother ram says we're
[50:26] in a third exodus
[50:28] and we know in the first exodus it was
[50:31] moses
[50:32] calling israel a nation out of a nation
[50:36] out of the nation of egypt
[50:37] and he had to go in and bring them out
[50:41] according to promise you see it wasn't
[50:43] just all of a sudden
[50:45] something moses decided to do because
[50:48] he did have a stage in his life where he
[50:49] just decided to go do that
[50:51] he thought i'm the man to do it and i'm
[50:54] going to go do it
[50:54] but he tried to do it the wrong time
[50:57] completely out of god's will
[50:59] but trying to go in and take the people
[51:03] out and deliver himself was out of god's
[51:05] will
[51:06] but him trying to do it
[51:09] at the wrong time and being forced out
[51:11] of egypt
[51:12] was not out of god's will think about
[51:15] that
[51:17] god needed something to drive him out of
[51:20] his cushy place in egypt
[51:22] where he thought he was going to do it
[51:24] his way
[51:25] and deliver them by his own power so he
[51:28] could
[51:29] take and deliver him from himself first
[51:32] so he could use him to come back and
[51:34] deliver a people
[51:36] you see so it looks like moses did the
[51:39] wrong thing
[51:41] and what he was attempting to do was
[51:42] wrong but god had it in his plan the
[51:45] whole time
[51:46] okay so we know that and in this day and
[51:49] age we had a prophet come
[51:50] and what did he come to do he came to
[51:53] call a church
[51:54] out of denomination okay
[51:57] so now if we begin to walk through start
[52:00] thinking about it put on
[52:01] your spiritual thinking caps we're
[52:03] stepping back we're looking into the old
[52:05] testament types
[52:07] so that we can see where are we at what
[52:09] is happening now
[52:11] in our day in our time not just during
[52:13] the day and time of the prophet not just
[52:15] during the day and time of moses
[52:17] but now we've gone on we can see moses
[52:20] my servant is dead
[52:22] the prophet has gone off the scene so
[52:24] now we can see we are placing ourself in
[52:26] time in the scripture
[52:28] so now what is the next steps because if
[52:32] god did it one way before he's doing it
[52:34] that same way again
[52:35] right now okay now
[52:38] there's a lot of controversy within the
[52:41] message i'm sure there's a lot of
[52:42] controversy in
[52:43] in joshua's time
[52:46] you know many many are stuck we're stuck
[52:49] on moses
[52:50] and moses's message you know they stayed
[52:53] stuck on
[52:53] moses's message and moses and never
[52:57] actually dug into his message and what
[52:58] it said and what it meant the promises
[53:01] for them
[53:01] meant for the next four or five thousand
[53:05] years to the days of christ
[53:08] do you know they stay stuck there they
[53:10] never actually
[53:12] got into the revelation of moses's
[53:14] message on what was coming for them
[53:16] and what their opportunities what the
[53:19] promises were for them
[53:21] and they stayed in that cycle going
[53:23] round and round but we want to take a a
[53:25] quick look here
[53:27] is that many people
[53:30] maybe want to stay and cling to moses
[53:33] cling to the prophet on this side and
[53:36] then you come on this side
[53:38] and and you have the people over here
[53:39] who are we don't need the prophet
[53:41] anymore we
[53:42] don't need this we don't need that you
[53:43] have all your eighth messengers you have
[53:45] extra people coming out
[53:47] they're the ones to lead you and fo to
[53:49] take you and show you the right way
[53:51] and they want to discard the prophet
[53:53] altogether
[53:54] and now we know by a prophet's message
[53:57] that it'll be somewhere right down the
[53:59] middle of that
[54:00] okay you see the chaos to the right you
[54:03] see the chaos to the left
[54:05] okay you're gonna be right in the middle
[54:07] now i gotta warn you
[54:08] you get in the middle and get ready
[54:10] because you're going to see
[54:12] a fight even greater and tougher and
[54:15] harder
[54:15] than if you wanted to go to the far
[54:17] right or the far left
[54:18] because you're going to be pressing down
[54:20] the middle of road and those on the
[54:22] right and the left will be throwing
[54:23] stones at you
[54:24] trying to knock you off trying to knock
[54:26] you off your path okay
[54:28] so here we are what we want to do
[54:31] is we're going to take a look first
[54:33] thing when god commissioned
[54:35] joshua okay and maybe we want to we want
[54:39] to think about
[54:40] who who does joshua represent and who
[54:43] does the promised land what does the
[54:44] promised land represent
[54:45] and you know they kind of if you study
[54:48] the message
[54:49] they intertwine and they have a similar
[54:51] representation
[54:52] we know that both joshua is a
[54:54] representation of the holy spirit
[54:56] and of christ and also the promised land
[55:01] is a representation of the holy spirit
[55:03] in your life
[55:05] stepping into the holy spirit and we'll
[55:07] go over that
[55:08] i'm going to try and stay mindful of the
[55:10] time so we're going to
[55:12] probably hit a lot of things what i want
[55:13] to do here is
[55:15] give you a lot of highlights
[55:20] and then you'll see what i'm driving for
[55:22] is you take those highlights home
[55:24] you know maybe you didn't bring a
[55:25] notebook and pen or maybe taking notes
[55:27] is not your thing
[55:28] and you're not really good at it luckily
[55:30] for you we're in a time and an
[55:32] age where you can go back and reference
[55:34] this as many times as you would like
[55:36] so you're in luck beyond that you're
[55:39] blessed
[55:40] we're very blessed okay
[55:43] so you'll notice in these first eight
[55:47] verses of joshua god makes
[55:50] tells him moses and my servant is dead
[55:53] okay we got to move on from here
[55:55] now therefore arise don't stay where
[55:57] you're at get up
[55:58] keep moving keep moving you have to keep
[56:01] moving forward you see
[56:02] god is never standing still he's always
[56:04] moving
[56:06] and you're gonna you've got to follow
[56:07] with him you see the children of israel
[56:09] have been doing that all the way through
[56:11] the message
[56:12] even with moses they weren't just
[56:14] following moses
[56:16] but as moses followed the pillar of fire
[56:19] they followed moses
[56:20] see but here something was about to
[56:22] switch something was about to change
[56:25] now it's the eyes are coming off of
[56:27] moses and going fully and totally on the
[56:29] pillar of fire
[56:31] now the people as individuals as
[56:34] families
[56:35] and as the church eyes are set on the
[56:38] pillar of fire
[56:39] stepping and moving forward now
[56:41] following that pillar of fire
[56:44] and not following just a profit or
[56:46] following the man
[56:47] but now there's been a relationship
[56:49] change eliezer has
[56:51] passed off rebecca to isaac
[56:54] okay we're going somewhere and if you
[56:57] don't make that
[56:58] handoff you're not going to enter into
[56:59] the promised land
[57:01] you see whoever wanted to enter into the
[57:04] promised land
[57:06] had to leave off following moses because
[57:09] if they still wanted to follow moses
[57:11] we know he went up into the wilderness
[57:14] onto the mountain we know
[57:16] and he died and the angel lords packed
[57:20] him away he had no grave
[57:22] so i'm sure there was many people in the
[57:23] camp were like we have no proof he's
[57:25] dead
[57:26] we'll just go out into the mountains and
[57:28] look for him
[57:30] we ain't just following you joshua
[57:31] because you say so
[57:33] moses is our prophet and away they go
[57:36] into the mountains and guess what
[57:37] the mountains were this side of the
[57:38] promised land
[57:41] okay but you'll notice
[57:44] in his commission to joshua the lord
[57:47] emphasizes joshua i'm not giving you a
[57:49] new message
[57:52] you are going to be leading these
[57:54] children in a fulfillment
[57:55] of the message i gave moses he said
[57:58] stick to that message
[57:59] believe that message meditate on that
[58:02] message
[58:03] day and night because in there are the
[58:05] promises
[58:06] of your inheritance in the promised land
[58:10] so you see it's right in the middle
[58:13] we're following joshua
[58:14] as joshua leads us
[58:18] into claiming the promises in the
[58:20] message
[58:21] moses brought to us given him by a
[58:23] pillar of fire
[58:25] so is it today as we step forward
[58:29] hold on getting ahead of myself a little
[58:31] bit i want to take a look at one other
[58:33] thing okay
[58:34] now we know the first thing they do
[58:37] is they they have to cross jordan
[58:41] okay they have to get past this
[58:43] representation of self this
[58:45] representation of the flesh this
[58:46] representation of death to oneself
[58:50] jordan means to descend and it's
[58:53] representation with death
[58:55] it means to lower yourself abase
[58:57] yourself
[58:58] and before you enter into the land of
[59:00] the promise of the holy ghost
[59:01] you're gonna have to humble yourself set
[59:04] yourself to the side
[59:05] so he can come in in dwell in your heart
[59:08] and take full control
[59:11] okay now
[59:14] the people were about to see that god
[59:17] was with joshua
[59:19] just like he was with moses why because
[59:21] he's going to do the exact same thing
[59:24] that he had done with moses with joshua
[59:28] but here's something key are you ready
[59:31] okay
[59:32] we could read it but just for your
[59:33] reference i'm just going to paraphrase
[59:35] the story through because you all know
[59:37] it and if you don't
[59:37] it's in joshua 3. go back and read it in
[59:40] fact go read the whole book of joshua
[59:42] some time as soon as you can jump into
[59:45] the scripture jump into the message jump
[59:47] into the
[59:48] the your bible read it see when whenever
[59:51] a thought strikes you and you take it up
[59:53] from the service something really
[59:55] strikes you in a service write that
[59:56] thing down even if it's one thing take
[59:58] it home
[59:58] and go back to the bible go back to the
[1:00:00] message
[1:00:02] how many of you have a smartphone here
[1:00:03] today oh
[1:00:05] good good how many of you have a
[1:00:07] computer at home
[1:00:09] how many of you have access to a
[1:00:10] computer anywhere
[1:00:14] you guys are really lucky
[1:00:18] you know why because
[1:00:21] maybe you're not a minister of
[1:00:24] 30 years in this message maybe you don't
[1:00:28] have the bible memorized maybe
[1:00:32] you're new to the message altogether
[1:00:34] maybe you're new to christianity
[1:00:38] but god has given us access
[1:00:42] to not only the scripture but to this
[1:00:44] message in a way
[1:00:46] to where even the unlearned and
[1:00:48] unknowing
[1:00:49] can go right in and begin searching out
[1:00:52] whatever it is that god has put on their
[1:00:55] heart
[1:00:56] and then begin anointing that to you as
[1:00:58] you begin to dig in
[1:01:00] and dig into the message you can go to
[1:01:02] that word search
[1:01:03] and find hopefully a language you
[1:01:06] understand
[1:01:07] and begin to type it out and begin to go
[1:01:09] in there
[1:01:10] and find this quote and find that quote
[1:01:12] and bring it bring it together and see
[1:01:13] where he mentioned a scripture and go
[1:01:14] read it in the scripture and if he if he
[1:01:16] mentions moses go read about moses if he
[1:01:18] mentions abraham go read about abraham
[1:01:20] if he mentions christ go jump into the
[1:01:21] gospels
[1:01:23] begin bringing it all together okay
[1:01:26] and you're gonna see like this is this
[1:01:28] there's a point to that
[1:01:31] it's all about entering into the
[1:01:32] promised land
[1:01:34] okay now there we are in joshua chapter
[1:01:38] three
[1:01:39] first thing he's doing is god has
[1:01:41] vindicated joshua's ministry to joshua
[1:01:44] and commissioned him and now he's going
[1:01:46] to vindicate joshua's ministry to the
[1:01:48] people
[1:01:49] here they go they come down to the water
[1:01:52] edge
[1:01:52] of jordan it's springtime and it says
[1:01:56] the jordan
[1:01:57] is overflowing its banks now based on
[1:01:59] where they crossed
[1:02:00] they don't know exactly how wide it was
[1:02:03] that day
[1:02:04] or whatnot but typically the jordan
[1:02:06] river is anywhere from
[1:02:09] 70 to 100 feet wide when it's not
[1:02:12] overflowing its banks
[1:02:13] and anywhere from 5 to 10 feet deep
[1:02:19] so now it's overflowing its banks we can
[1:02:21] be sure it's at least 100 feet wide
[1:02:23] and probably at least 10 feet deep
[1:02:26] now i was reading and just an excerpt on
[1:02:30] someone i forget who it was just online
[1:02:33] and they said the miracle was not that
[1:02:35] they crossed the jordan
[1:02:37] the miracle was that they crossed it on
[1:02:39] dry land
[1:02:43] scripture says they crossed it on dry
[1:02:46] land you see
[1:02:47] because even if you can clear the water
[1:02:51] i mean it rained all day today if you go
[1:02:53] stepping into the marsh
[1:02:56] you're going to be knee-deep in mud the
[1:02:58] ability to cross is extremely limited
[1:03:01] but god
[1:03:02] knew if he wanted to cross his people he
[1:03:05] was going to do more than
[1:03:07] hold back the water to hold back death
[1:03:10] but he was going to take away all the
[1:03:12] effects of death itself
[1:03:15] all the effects of that humanity of your
[1:03:17] flesh
[1:03:19] it's all going to go away it's all
[1:03:21] things that are compensated for
[1:03:22] by the baptism of the holy ghost you see
[1:03:25] too many times we try and hold on to our
[1:03:27] flesh
[1:03:29] you know whether it's family traits um
[1:03:32] and whether that's just family traits of
[1:03:34] well
[1:03:34] i'm whatever it is um depression you
[1:03:37] want to claim that for your family
[1:03:39] heart disease any type of ailment
[1:03:42] whether it's
[1:03:42] a physical ailment and uh let's say
[1:03:46] yeah my whole family the you know
[1:03:48] they're all real
[1:03:50] fire brands you push their button too
[1:03:51] much the wrong way and
[1:03:53] boom we're off to a start so don't get
[1:03:54] me going
[1:03:56] guess what that's what the holy ghost
[1:03:58] came for it came to remove that
[1:04:01] that's not even an option anymore you
[1:04:03] see because
[1:04:05] as a son and daughter of god if you want
[1:04:08] to receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:09] you have to give up your human rights
[1:04:12] that the rights to that human nature
[1:04:16] you know everyone's here we we are in a
[1:04:19] time of rights
[1:04:22] and we know brother and speaks about he
[1:04:23] said the lamb the sheep they give up all
[1:04:26] their rights
[1:04:28] but here's something good and i'll touch
[1:04:30] on this too
[1:04:33] and just wait for it but you know you
[1:04:35] get a whole new set of rights
[1:04:38] you do and we'll touch on that
[1:04:41] okay they're crossing the jordan now
[1:04:44] you'll notice
[1:04:46] go back and read it is joshua
[1:04:50] put everything in order the way it
[1:04:53] should be
[1:04:56] and for the people to have the victory
[1:05:01] he doesn't come up with a new idea he
[1:05:03] doesn't come up with some new message
[1:05:07] he takes the ministry
[1:05:10] that was put in order by moses
[1:05:15] with the promises of god
[1:05:19] and the word that was thus saith the
[1:05:21] lord
[1:05:23] to lead the people across jordan
[1:05:27] joshua didn't make anything of himself
[1:05:29] he didn't say watch me look at me look
[1:05:31] what i can do
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:33] he said no god has already put a
[1:05:36] ministry in place for this day in this
[1:05:38] age a five-fold ministry
[1:05:40] he said and they're gonna take that word
[1:05:42] and they're gonna lead us across this
[1:05:44] jordan and as the ministry
[1:05:48] took the first steps you see that's the
[1:05:50] that's something that'll be a
[1:05:52] characteristic of any true
[1:05:53] ministry that god puts in place
[1:05:57] they will always lead you right into
[1:06:00] death itself
[1:06:03] they'll take those first few steps into
[1:06:05] the jordan
[1:06:06] because they know they're packing god's
[1:06:08] word they know they're packing thus
[1:06:09] saith the lord for your day
[1:06:11] and without fear or favor they'll step
[1:06:13] right in
[1:06:14] and you'll watch those waters part the
[1:06:18] waters of
[1:06:18] this world the people surrounding the
[1:06:21] thoughts the idea the chaos
[1:06:24] and as they do those waters will fall
[1:06:26] back because nothing can stand before
[1:06:28] thus saith the lord
[1:06:29] the word put in its place so here's the
[1:06:32] first thing joshua does is he puts the
[1:06:33] ministry and the word in its place
[1:06:36] before the people and the way they go
[1:06:39] to cross jordan and as long as the word
[1:06:42] stood in its place
[1:06:44] the people could cross every single one
[1:06:47] right through the word right through the
[1:06:49] word
[1:06:50] everyone through the word
[1:06:53] now everyone who did not want to take
[1:06:56] that route
[1:06:57] through the ministry and place and the
[1:06:59] word for that hour
[1:07:01] stayed on the other side
[1:07:05] they had come out of egypt they had gone
[1:07:08] all through they had learned really good
[1:07:10] church order
[1:07:12] moses taught him church order he put
[1:07:14] this church in order he set it straight
[1:07:17] he he set him straight on doctrine he
[1:07:19] said i'm straight on all kinds of stuff
[1:07:22] okay but they decided they weren't
[1:07:24] following joshua over
[1:07:26] they were staying on this side of the
[1:07:27] river they'd had enough this is as far
[1:07:29] as we're going to go
[1:07:30] they were still seat of abraham
[1:07:34] but they stopped short okay so now we
[1:07:38] see
[1:07:38] there's an order okay
[1:07:42] let's move on
[1:07:45] what we see
[1:07:50] when moses received his commission
[1:07:57] god came to him and got his attention
[1:08:00] in exodus 3
[1:08:04] verse 1 and 6.
[1:08:09] i'm probably only going to read five but
[1:08:11] here's where moses he's out in the
[1:08:12] wilderness
[1:08:14] god's had him out here for a while he's
[1:08:16] been out here for 40 years
[1:08:17] wandering around with a bunch of sheep
[1:08:20] in the middle of the desert
[1:08:22] all his ideas of how to save the
[1:08:24] children of israel are done and over
[1:08:25] with
[1:08:26] as far as he's concerned i'm going to
[1:08:28] live out my life here me
[1:08:29] my wife my boys i'm going to walk around
[1:08:31] with these sheep
[1:08:32] and that's it he had no aspirations of
[1:08:36] his own anymore
[1:08:37] he hardly even thought of the children
[1:08:39] of israel back in egypt
[1:08:41] he had failed that's good that's good
[1:08:46] that's where each one of us has to go
[1:08:48] that's where we all have to get to
[1:08:50] a point where we realize that we in
[1:08:52] ourselves
[1:08:53] are a failure and at that point now
[1:08:56] god has him where he's ready to work
[1:08:59] with him
[1:09:00] and he comes down and he gets his
[1:09:02] attention
[1:09:04] and in verse five and he's
[1:09:10] he sees the the burning bush it attracts
[1:09:13] him it draws him in
[1:09:14] and when he gets there the lord speaks
[1:09:17] to him out of the bush
[1:09:20] moses responds and the lord tells him
[1:09:22] and he said
[1:09:23] draw nigh not nigh hither put off thy
[1:09:26] shoes from off thy feet
[1:09:28] from the place whereon thou standest is
[1:09:31] holy ground
[1:09:36] here he is he's meeting the pillar of
[1:09:39] fire for the first time
[1:09:42] we see the requirements for coming
[1:09:45] on to this place god speaks to him from
[1:09:49] out of the bush
[1:09:50] and we see his experience
[1:09:54] he can't go there with any man-made idea
[1:09:59] any man-made protection of any kind he
[1:10:02] has to step into that presence just him
[1:10:03] and god alone
[1:10:06] there's something about it god talks
[1:10:08] about the steps of the righteous
[1:10:10] order to the lord he talks about the
[1:10:12] footsteps of the the ministry
[1:10:15] he for something about it it's something
[1:10:17] god
[1:10:19] really focuses on your footprints
[1:10:23] but it matters to him on how and where
[1:10:25] you make those footprints
[1:10:26] you can't just make it with your own
[1:10:28] ideas
[1:10:30] and he has him take off his shoes okay
[1:10:34] now we're not going to focus here but my
[1:10:36] reason for pointing this out is now
[1:10:37] we're going to jump to joshua 5
[1:10:39] 13-15 they've crossed the jordan they're
[1:10:43] on the other side
[1:10:44] joshua is a great general and he goes to
[1:10:48] see
[1:10:49] the city they're going to be attacking
[1:10:52] you see they're in atlanta promise
[1:10:53] it's all theirs
[1:10:56] but they still got to fight see brother
[1:10:59] brown said that's how
[1:11:01] you know this is a representation of the
[1:11:03] holy ghost
[1:11:05] is you get the holy ghost and measures
[1:11:07] but you're gonna have to fight for every
[1:11:08] promise
[1:11:09] it's not it's gonna be given to you you
[1:11:12] see when they crossed into the promised
[1:11:13] land
[1:11:15] within moments and the day after they
[1:11:18] crossed into the promised land
[1:11:20] they began to partake of the promises of
[1:11:22] the land
[1:11:23] the first fruits the old corn of the
[1:11:26] land
[1:11:27] the original the original word the
[1:11:29] original seed
[1:11:31] and when they do the manna that they've
[1:11:34] been receiving for over 40 years in the
[1:11:36] wilderness ceases
[1:11:38] that manner just fell from heaven they
[1:11:40] didn't have to work for it they didn't
[1:11:41] have to do nothing
[1:11:42] it just fell they went outside their
[1:11:43] tent kind of happened chance just kind
[1:11:46] of well it's always here
[1:11:47] i guess i'll pick some up today
[1:11:51] gone why because ministry was changing
[1:11:56] god wasn't bathing his people anymore
[1:12:00] he said you want it you've got to fight
[1:12:02] for it you're gonna have to dig
[1:12:03] in you have to go find it you're gonna
[1:12:05] have to search it out
[1:12:07] that's what he wants for each one of you
[1:12:09] yeah you're going to come in
[1:12:10] through stages of your life
[1:12:12] justification sanctification
[1:12:14] and baptism of the holy ghost when he
[1:12:16] gets you there
[1:12:17] maybe you've been having the milk of the
[1:12:19] word all the way up until here
[1:12:21] boom when you get here you're crossing
[1:12:23] over into meat territory
[1:12:26] you're crossing over into where it's
[1:12:27] actually going to take you some work
[1:12:30] to get the nutrients out of the food you
[1:12:33] can't just swallow
[1:12:34] you better be careful just swallowing
[1:12:35] you'll choke on it
[1:12:37] you'll choke on it god wants you to
[1:12:40] start
[1:12:41] digging in deeper and deeper
[1:12:44] breaking it down finding out what is
[1:12:46] these promises that are meant for me
[1:12:48] what is my inheritance
[1:12:51] and moving forward okay
[1:12:55] so here he is captain of the host
[1:12:59] joshua he's the general over the people
[1:13:02] but he's about to have an experience
[1:13:04] just like moses just like moses
[1:13:08] because every son and daughter of god
[1:13:11] called of god
[1:13:12] is gonna have to have a similar
[1:13:15] experience
[1:13:16] with the pillar of fire maybe for you
[1:13:18] it'll be a
[1:13:19] burning fiery bush in the wilderness
[1:13:23] maybe for some of us like joshua will be
[1:13:26] we'll be there surveying the land
[1:13:28] and asking god lord what do i do how do
[1:13:31] i take this promise
[1:13:33] and he'll come to you like he did to
[1:13:34] joshua and it came to pass when joshua
[1:13:37] was by jericho they lifted up his eyes
[1:13:38] and looked and behold
[1:13:40] there stood a man over against him with
[1:13:42] a sword drawn in his
[1:13:43] hand you see now that pillar of fire
[1:13:47] is not just something in passing it's
[1:13:50] not just
[1:13:51] a symbol but it's taken on flesh
[1:13:55] christ himself embodied
[1:14:00] and you think wow joshua would recognize
[1:14:03] an angel lord immediately
[1:14:05] he didn't he didn't
[1:14:12] no
[1:14:14] and behold there stood a man over
[1:14:16] against him with his sword drawn in his
[1:14:18] hand and joshua went
[1:14:19] unto him and said unto him art thou for
[1:14:24] us or for our adversaries and he said
[1:14:27] nay but as
[1:14:28] captain of the host of the lord am i now
[1:14:30] come
[1:14:31] and joshua fell on his face to the earth
[1:14:34] and did worship and said unto him what
[1:14:36] saith my lord unto a servant
[1:14:39] now look at the similarity here
[1:14:43] he showed up in a different form but the
[1:14:45] approach
[1:14:46] is the same
[1:14:49] and the captain of the lord's host said
[1:14:51] unto joshua
[1:14:53] loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the
[1:14:56] place wherein thou standest
[1:14:57] is holy and joshua did so
[1:15:03] here it is same experience they had to
[1:15:06] both of them in order to lead the people
[1:15:09] had to have that same experience with
[1:15:11] the pillar of fire
[1:15:13] they couldn't just feed off of well
[1:15:15] we've been following the pillar of
[1:15:16] fire through moses and that's good
[1:15:18] enough no
[1:15:20] each one had to have that experience
[1:15:23] with that pillar of fire meet him on her
[1:15:26] own grounds
[1:15:41] all right
[1:15:52] okay uh the power of
[1:15:55] decision 1955 that's where we read a
[1:15:58] quick
[1:15:59] part of this quote um oh i feel
[1:16:02] religious my
[1:16:03] know that the holy ghost is here the
[1:16:05] same plural fire that led the children
[1:16:08] through the wilderness and went with
[1:16:10] them to the promised land
[1:16:11] you see here confirmation is the same
[1:16:13] polarifier with moses
[1:16:15] with joshua with the children of israel
[1:16:18] now today
[1:16:19] in our time jesus christ same yesterday
[1:16:22] today and forever
[1:16:23] jehovah the old is jesus of the new
[1:16:26] he just takes keeps changing form you
[1:16:29] see
[1:16:29] in 40 years he changed form when he came
[1:16:32] to moses
[1:16:33] he was a burning bush you know that
[1:16:35] joshua's experience with him
[1:16:37] was greater than moses because then
[1:16:40] moses
[1:16:40] asked lord let me see you he put him up
[1:16:44] in the cleft of the rock
[1:16:45] and he said when i pass by i'll put my
[1:16:48] hand over as i pass by and you'll see me
[1:16:50] the backside and he did and he said
[1:16:54] he looked and he saw it it was as the
[1:16:56] back side of a man
[1:16:58] but here joshua saw him face to
[1:17:02] face eye to eye
[1:17:06] it was greater he's changing forms he's
[1:17:09] revealing himself to his people as they
[1:17:11] enter into the promise
[1:17:12] all right now think these are types
[1:17:15] these are types
[1:17:16] keep keep that in there think about it
[1:17:20] let your let your mind as god would work
[1:17:23] on your heart
[1:17:24] do the walking as the prophet say
[1:17:26] through the scripture
[1:17:28] think about it this is not this is one
[1:17:30] instance i share with you
[1:17:32] he did it all through the scripture from
[1:17:35] beginning here with all the way from
[1:17:38] genesis i mean
[1:17:39] here we are we've barely made it to
[1:17:40] joshua we're barely into the sixth book
[1:17:42] of the bible
[1:17:43] there's 66 books my friends
[1:17:46] there's so much more this is one story
[1:17:49] in the sixth book
[1:17:52] don't stop here don't just take it as a
[1:17:54] good sermon
[1:17:55] go search it out dig in see
[1:17:59] who else he did it for so if you can see
[1:18:01] he did it for more than one person
[1:18:03] he'll do it for you too okay
[1:18:06] now let's keep moving okay
[1:18:10] where did i stop um the same pillar of
[1:18:13] fire that led the children through the
[1:18:14] wilderness went with them
[1:18:15] to the promised land here he is with us
[1:18:17] tonight even had his picture taken
[1:18:19] all over and over showing the same signs
[1:18:22] and wonders whose picture was taken
[1:18:24] the pillar of fire jesus christ himself
[1:18:29] that's important to remember
[1:18:33] because too many people put
[1:18:36] too much on moses and not on the pillar
[1:18:39] of fire that was over the tabernacle
[1:18:42] okay we're not we don't take nothing
[1:18:44] from moses we don't take nothing from
[1:18:45] the prophet
[1:18:47] but we're following a pillar of fire
[1:18:50] and we need it's more important to know
[1:18:53] who that pillar of fire was
[1:18:55] than to know who the prophet was
[1:19:00] because if you never knew the prophet
[1:19:02] you never knew his name
[1:19:04] but if you came and met the pillar of
[1:19:06] fire face to face
[1:19:08] you'll never be the same again you could
[1:19:10] know the prophet's name
[1:19:12] you could know all about his life and
[1:19:14] you can end up like janice and jamborus
[1:19:16] in the wilderness
[1:19:18] who opposed him said moses we know your
[1:19:20] faults we know you killed an egyptian
[1:19:22] you're not the only holy one amongst us
[1:19:24] and you know what happened to them
[1:19:26] the earth the world swallowed them and
[1:19:29] their families up whole
[1:19:32] they left egypt they made it through
[1:19:34] justification
[1:19:36] they made it into a point where the
[1:19:38] church was put in order
[1:19:39] they had good church order but their
[1:19:42] focus was on moses
[1:19:43] and they found fault with moses and
[1:19:45] guess what moses had plenty of faults to
[1:19:48] find
[1:19:50] because god never meant for the focus to
[1:19:52] be on moses
[1:19:53] he meant for it to be on the pillar of
[1:19:54] fire but the people rejected him
[1:19:57] at mount zion
[1:20:03] because they were so focused on moses
[1:20:05] and all those people who were focused on
[1:20:07] moses
[1:20:07] perished in the wilderness
[1:20:11] okay now
[1:20:17] showing the same signs and wonders what
[1:20:18] are we scared about
[1:20:20] by faith don't care i feel like
[1:20:23] caleb let me have that bunch over yonder
[1:20:26] amen and if you want to read the rest of
[1:20:28] that
[1:20:30] it's the power decision 1955.
[1:20:33] there's a whole message out there for
[1:20:34] you to listen to it gets even better
[1:20:37] it really does but i want to jump into
[1:20:40] now because he mentioned
[1:20:41] caleb and i think caleb is a
[1:20:43] representation of the true believer
[1:20:45] in the church okay
[1:20:49] now in joshua 14 5-15
[1:20:52] we're coming to the end they've fought a
[1:20:55] lot of battles already
[1:20:57] they're in there clear claiming the
[1:20:58] promised land
[1:21:01] caleb has been fighting for the last
[1:21:04] 80 years he's been fighting for 80
[1:21:08] years he was five years old when they
[1:21:11] left egypt
[1:21:14] and he's been fighting for 80 years he's
[1:21:17] been through every church split
[1:21:19] he's been through every church problem
[1:21:22] he's had to bear with the people when
[1:21:25] the people
[1:21:26] didn't think they could take the promise
[1:21:28] and he had he went right back out there
[1:21:30] with them
[1:21:31] all right here we go again these people
[1:21:34] let's just wander around another 40
[1:21:36] years
[1:21:38] and finally he's made it to the promise
[1:21:43] he's in here you would think you made it
[1:21:45] buddy
[1:21:46] relax take it easy that wasn't caleb
[1:21:51] that wasn't his way
[1:21:54] caleb had a promise from moses's message
[1:21:58] for him about his inheritance and he
[1:22:01] wasn't going to stop
[1:22:02] until he had every bit of it he went to
[1:22:05] joshua
[1:22:07] he went to joshua
[1:22:10] to remind him of the promises
[1:22:14] in the word that were for him
[1:22:17] okay and he said and caleb the son of
[1:22:21] jeff neff that kenazi said unto him
[1:22:25] thou knowest the things that the lord
[1:22:27] said unto moses
[1:22:29] the man of god concerning me
[1:22:32] and thee in kadesh barnea
[1:22:36] you know and i know
[1:22:40] this is no secret you know why i'm here
[1:22:48] now let's jump down
[1:22:53] in verse 8 it says nevertheless my
[1:22:56] brethren that went up with me made the
[1:22:57] heart of the people melt
[1:22:58] but i wholly followed the lord my god
[1:23:03] you see there's going to be a
[1:23:04] consistency in his life no matter what
[1:23:06] stage
[1:23:07] of he is in whether he's coming out of
[1:23:09] egypt
[1:23:10] he's coming through the wilderness or
[1:23:12] he's going into the the baptism of the
[1:23:14] holy ghost
[1:23:15] there's something about the true
[1:23:16] believer is whatever stage they're
[1:23:18] in to the best of their ability that
[1:23:20] they wholly
[1:23:21] follow the lord their god to the best
[1:23:25] that they understand the word for that
[1:23:26] moment for their revelation in that hour
[1:23:29] they're following it but they're seeking
[1:23:30] for something more
[1:23:32] this is what i know right now i must
[1:23:34] stick to it the best i can
[1:23:35] i think too many times we we think we
[1:23:38] always think of the three believers in
[1:23:40] the church right
[1:23:41] the make the unbeliever the
[1:23:42] make-believer the believer
[1:23:44] but we forget that even in the
[1:23:46] believer's life there's multiple stages
[1:23:50] you know we always think justification
[1:23:52] sanctification
[1:23:53] baptism of the holy ghost well these are
[1:23:55] all played out
[1:23:57] you had coming out of egypt you had
[1:23:59] going
[1:24:00] they had to be justified they had to be
[1:24:02] set free of their bondage
[1:24:04] just to get out of there now going
[1:24:07] through the wilderness
[1:24:08] they they need to get things cleaned up
[1:24:10] and sanctified
[1:24:12] moses is there you know he's giving them
[1:24:14] the basics don't kill
[1:24:16] don't commit adultery don't cleaning up
[1:24:18] their lives what is that sanctification
[1:24:20] setting the church in order and now
[1:24:22] they're going to step into the
[1:24:23] baptism of the holy ghost caleb has gone
[1:24:26] through each stage
[1:24:28] he's been there each stage he's ready
[1:24:30] now he's in the baptism of the holy
[1:24:32] ghost
[1:24:33] and moses swear on that day saying
[1:24:35] surely the land wherein
[1:24:36] thy feet have trodden shall be thine
[1:24:38] inheritance
[1:24:39] and thy children's forever because thou
[1:24:41] hast wholly
[1:24:42] followed the lord my god and on 11
[1:24:47] as yet i am as strong this day
[1:24:50] as i was in the day that moses sent me
[1:24:54] as my strength was then even so is my
[1:24:57] strength
[1:24:58] now for war both to go out and come in
[1:25:02] verse 13 and joshua blessed him and gave
[1:25:05] unto caleb the son of
[1:25:07] geneva hebron for an inheritance
[1:25:11] you see he'd been in the message for 40
[1:25:14] years
[1:25:15] but his zeal and his fervor for the word
[1:25:18] hadn't changed
[1:25:20] every day he wanted a little bit more
[1:25:22] lord
[1:25:23] you gave me a great revelation yesterday
[1:25:25] but give me something more today
[1:25:27] i need something new this this morning
[1:25:31] i can't just sit back and and relax
[1:25:34] and say well my experience i remember
[1:25:37] that experience when i got
[1:25:38] back when i got converted it was a
[1:25:40] wonderful experience and i received the
[1:25:42] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:25:44] good enough no
[1:25:47] that wasn't good enough for caleb he
[1:25:50] wanted more
[1:25:51] because there was more to be had he had
[1:25:54] a promise
[1:25:54] and you know how he knew that promise he
[1:25:57] kept the word of moses
[1:25:59] in his heart he kept the message fresh
[1:26:02] and alive
[1:26:03] even all the years he spent fighting to
[1:26:06] help gain
[1:26:07] inheritance for everyone else
[1:26:10] he kept going back to the word of moses
[1:26:13] and saying
[1:26:14] there's something that is specific for
[1:26:17] me
[1:26:18] it's not just for the church it's not
[1:26:20] just for all of us
[1:26:22] there's something with my name on it
[1:26:24] because i know my name's on it because
[1:26:26] i'm in the message
[1:26:27] reading it and i see it it's there
[1:26:30] and i'll keep reminding joshua
[1:26:33] the holy spirit that that promise is
[1:26:36] made to me
[1:26:37] until i get it nonstop
[1:27:04] now i mentioned to you that
[1:27:08] they were stuck on moses as their
[1:27:12] prophet
[1:27:14] all the up to the time of christ
[1:27:20] many of them didn't recognize anyone
[1:27:22] else
[1:27:23] they never moved beyond moses
[1:27:26] you know how i know when jesus came
[1:27:32] they were following moses the man
[1:27:35] the prophet and not moses's message
[1:27:41] they had fixated on we have moses to our
[1:27:44] prophet
[1:27:45] and stop there they had memorized the
[1:27:48] message
[1:27:49] many of the ministers of that day could
[1:27:51] quote you the message by heart
[1:27:54] but they had no revelation of the
[1:27:56] message
[1:27:58] you see because christ didn't come with
[1:27:59] a new message
[1:28:03] he was simply a fulfillment of the
[1:28:05] message
[1:28:07] he said i've come to fulfill
[1:28:11] all these scriptures all throughout the
[1:28:13] old testament
[1:28:14] all these types i've come to fulfill
[1:28:16] them i am the manifestation
[1:28:19] of the message he is the revelation
[1:28:23] of that message but they were so
[1:28:26] fixated on god sent a prophet they had
[1:28:29] no idea what the message the prophets
[1:28:31] even spoke was you see
[1:28:35] in john 1 and
[1:28:39] 45 there were people who recognized him
[1:28:44] the disciples did philip for one he went
[1:28:47] to nathanael and he said
[1:28:49] we have found him of whom moses and the
[1:28:52] law
[1:28:52] and the prophets did right these were
[1:28:55] men
[1:28:57] who were in the word they read the books
[1:29:00] of moses
[1:29:01] they read the books of isaiah the
[1:29:03] scrolls of ezekiel
[1:29:04] and they saw the promise and they were
[1:29:07] waiting
[1:29:08] they were searching they were digging in
[1:29:10] like caleb
[1:29:11] they knew there was more to the promise
[1:29:16] so when they saw it they said there it
[1:29:18] is
[1:29:19] why because they had a revelation
[1:29:23] of the message and not just
[1:29:26] the fact that a prophet had given it you
[1:29:29] see
[1:29:30] it's not good enough just to know god
[1:29:32] sent a prophet
[1:29:35] most of the world in the 50s and 60s
[1:29:38] knew that
[1:29:42] but it wasn't revealed to them so they
[1:29:45] said things like
[1:29:49] we know we don't know anyone else
[1:29:52] which such a wonderful christian-like
[1:29:55] spirit and the love of god in his life
[1:29:58] or the power of god
[1:30:00] being manifested but
[1:30:03] we're pretty sure you're off in your
[1:30:04] doctrine you kind of went off the wagon
[1:30:07] there
[1:30:08] how much sense does that make
[1:30:12] it was the same thing in christ's time
[1:30:14] here in
[1:30:15] john 9 28 through 37
[1:30:18] there was a blind man who'd received
[1:30:20] back his sight
[1:30:21] been born blind okay
[1:30:25] now don't think we've strayed from the
[1:30:26] book of joshua
[1:30:28] we're just trying to show it's the same
[1:30:32] we're moving on we want to move you
[1:30:34] through the timeline here
[1:30:36] and through time um
[1:30:39] so you can see it's not just old
[1:30:41] testament
[1:30:42] it's not just new testament then we want
[1:30:44] to move it to us
[1:30:46] and we want to do it as we go or wait to
[1:30:48] the end and if you need to wait to see
[1:30:50] all the evidence first that's okay
[1:30:52] and even if you get all the evidence
[1:30:54] you're still not sure go search it out
[1:30:55] for yourself
[1:30:57] in fact that's even better okay
[1:31:00] now the blind man then they reviled him
[1:31:03] and said thou art his disciple but we
[1:31:06] are moses's disciples
[1:31:09] you see where they're at disciples of
[1:31:12] moses
[1:31:14] we know that god spake unto moses as for
[1:31:17] this fellow
[1:31:18] we know not from whence he is
[1:31:23] now this
[1:31:26] man he was just a simple brother he said
[1:31:29] well i'm nobody but
[1:31:31] even being nobody i know that the only
[1:31:33] person who can open blind eyes is god
[1:31:37] and you know what they did the same
[1:31:39] thing people are doing yet today
[1:31:43] when you say god is still moving in our
[1:31:45] midst
[1:31:47] when you say there is god moving in a
[1:31:49] five-fold ministry
[1:31:51] and the power of the holy ghost
[1:31:54] revealing himself even more
[1:31:58] to the individual day by day
[1:32:01] they go how how is it you think you can
[1:32:03] be more spiritual than the prophet
[1:32:06] how does it think you can have a greater
[1:32:07] revelation than the prophet
[1:32:12] because they're so fixated on the man
[1:32:15] that they've elevated him to a place
[1:32:18] of sainthood that they can never attain
[1:32:22] and for anyone else to get there is
[1:32:24] sacrilege
[1:32:29] that's what they told jesus how dare you
[1:32:31] being a man
[1:32:32] claim to be the son of god and yet isn't
[1:32:35] that what each one of you are all here
[1:32:36] yet
[1:32:37] today to claim sons and daughters of god
[1:32:41] now how dare you why because we have a
[1:32:44] revelation of who we are
[1:32:47] you see now here's what the attack is
[1:32:49] and it's still the same today
[1:32:51] they answered and said unto him thou was
[1:32:53] also together born in sin
[1:32:55] and thus thou teach us and they cast him
[1:32:58] out
[1:32:59] you see if they can't contradict the
[1:33:02] message
[1:33:03] they'll go to personal attacks and when
[1:33:06] after the personal attack then they will
[1:33:09] completely
[1:33:10] shut you out from their circle of
[1:33:12] friends
[1:33:14] why because light and darkness cannot
[1:33:18] mix
[1:33:19] now we know all throughout the message
[1:33:21] where the man talks about draw the
[1:33:22] circle bigger
[1:33:23] and i say yes draw the circle bigger
[1:33:26] but as you draw the circle bigger if you
[1:33:29] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:33:31] darkness will flee from the circle no
[1:33:33] matter how big you make it
[1:33:36] okay now
[1:33:41] one more just showing us the place that
[1:33:44] they were at
[1:33:45] john 5 45-47
[1:33:48] and jesus himself speaking to them
[1:33:53] says do not think that i will accuse you
[1:33:55] to the father there is one that accuses
[1:33:57] you
[1:33:58] even moses your very own prophet
[1:34:01] if you knew his message would condemn
[1:34:04] you
[1:34:05] and does condemn you that's why we stand
[1:34:09] in a place
[1:34:10] where the same message preached across
[1:34:12] the pulpit
[1:34:14] coming off of the tapes is both
[1:34:18] a message of deliverance and yet
[1:34:21] also a message of
[1:34:24] of judgment to the completely and
[1:34:26] totally lost
[1:34:28] because outside of a revelation and
[1:34:32] seeing yourself in the word as a son and
[1:34:33] daughter of god there's only one other
[1:34:35] way to see yourself
[1:34:36] and that's totally lost so it's the same
[1:34:39] message many people think well
[1:34:41] you know during one time there's a
[1:34:42] message of grace and then there's a
[1:34:44] message of judgment
[1:34:46] no it's the same message
[1:34:50] it's what has god revealed to you
[1:34:54] and how do you identify that's the sage
[1:34:56] this whole world's in right
[1:34:58] we know spiritual types the natural
[1:34:59] natural types of spiritual everyone's in
[1:35:01] a state where
[1:35:02] we they wanting to identify in some way
[1:35:06] and find their identity why
[1:35:10] because we're in a time of the
[1:35:11] separating of the wheat from the shaft
[1:35:14] the wheat from the weed
[1:35:17] and each one as they're being separated
[1:35:20] is coming to their identity
[1:35:21] coming to their identity if you see
[1:35:24] something happening in the natural
[1:35:25] you can be sure it's already happening
[1:35:27] in the spiritual
[1:35:29] because god always moves first and the
[1:35:32] devil tries to copy it
[1:35:34] so don't be alarmed or confused if you
[1:35:37] see something
[1:35:37] that's happening out there and you see
[1:35:39] something moving in a certain way say
[1:35:41] wow hmm that's what the devil's doing
[1:35:44] so when did god already do it the right
[1:35:46] way
[1:35:50] everyone's clamoring for rights caleb
[1:35:54] was going for his rights as a believer
[1:35:58] in the holy ghost because anything
[1:36:00] that's a promise to you
[1:36:03] in the word if you come at it the way
[1:36:07] god has promised it it's your right
[1:36:10] as a believer that's what this whole
[1:36:13] baptism of the holy ghost is about
[1:36:15] is a continuation a continuation a
[1:36:18] continuation
[1:36:19] until you come to that place of adoption
[1:36:22] where you stand on the same
[1:36:24] level as the father himself to speak the
[1:36:28] word
[1:36:29] now you and the word are so the same
[1:36:33] that he's not worried what will you say
[1:36:36] he's not worried well i'll give him
[1:36:38] power he's and you're going to
[1:36:39] speak a mercedes into existence he knows
[1:36:43] that your values are the same as his
[1:36:45] and you'll speak the truth in love
[1:36:49] that's where we saw a prophet we saw it
[1:36:51] go all through those stages for us ahead
[1:36:53] of us
[1:36:55] he got to the place where god gave him
[1:36:57] full authority
[1:36:58] to speak the word because he knew he
[1:37:01] would not
[1:37:01] move outside of what god wanted him to
[1:37:05] do
[1:37:07] he wasn't worried about it and he's not
[1:37:10] some saint greater and above us he just
[1:37:14] is a saint that came to fruition first
[1:37:17] we're all going to that same place
[1:37:21] you see so to lift him on a pedestal
[1:37:25] above us greater than
[1:37:30] is not good
[1:37:33] because now if he's somewhere between
[1:37:35] you and god
[1:37:37] you can never have that relationship
[1:37:39] with the father
[1:37:40] because you've placed someone between
[1:37:42] you and him you'll never get there
[1:37:45] but if you and him are on the same level
[1:37:47] then you both have access to the father
[1:37:51] you see caleb caleb did not come
[1:37:54] begging joshua for his promise he just
[1:37:56] came to remind joshua
[1:37:59] this is mine as mine by right of
[1:38:02] inheritance
[1:38:03] you cannot keep it from me i will fight
[1:38:07] till the breath has left my body
[1:38:10] to gain it
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:17] all right just a few more minutes and
[1:38:20] we'll
[1:38:21] all right
[1:38:26] now we know that
[1:38:32] the signs the wonders the pictures that
[1:38:35] were taken
[1:38:36] around the prophet's message what were
[1:38:38] they all for
[1:38:42] the signs that moses had when he went to
[1:38:44] egypt
[1:38:46] what was it all about the signs all
[1:38:49] through the wilderness what was it about
[1:38:52] i'll tell you he was to get the people
[1:38:55] to christ
[1:38:57] all of it all of it was just
[1:39:01] to get the people to christ
[1:39:08] let me see here i'm gonna skip a few
[1:39:10] things because
[1:39:18] because like my my grandfather on my
[1:39:21] dad's side
[1:39:25] he used to he loved the message he loved
[1:39:28] being in the word
[1:39:30] and every once in a while you know he
[1:39:31] would read something and he'd share it
[1:39:33] with somebody he'd get
[1:39:34] excited about it at whether that was at
[1:39:37] church or
[1:39:38] someone around him and he'd share it
[1:39:40] with him they'd go wow
[1:39:41] where'd you get that from he said
[1:39:45] it's in the message they said which one
[1:39:46] he said all 1200 of them
[1:39:52] and you know that's how i feel sometimes
[1:39:55] i kind of feel like
[1:39:56] you know no there's many different forms
[1:39:59] of ministry that's why there's a
[1:40:00] five-fold ministry because there's
[1:40:01] something for everyone you know because
[1:40:04] sometimes as churches we get to a point
[1:40:06] where we get a little puffed up
[1:40:08] spiritually speaking and we are all
[1:40:11] the whole church is the church of
[1:40:13] ephesus
[1:40:14] you know we've all entered into the
[1:40:16] stage of adoption
[1:40:18] we're here we've made it so there's no
[1:40:20] need to preach anything else
[1:40:22] but it's not true we have people
[1:40:26] at all different stages and walks
[1:40:29] within the church and so there's going
[1:40:31] to have to be something
[1:40:32] for each one now i don't say that
[1:40:37] every minister has to find a way to
[1:40:40] cater
[1:40:41] to every person but
[1:40:44] the holy spirit in every message will
[1:40:47] have something for every person
[1:40:49] so guess what if it seems like it's
[1:40:52] really
[1:40:53] wow that's a lot to handle maybe for you
[1:40:58] because there's an ephesian message
[1:40:59] going out and that's not to belittle
[1:41:01] anyone
[1:41:02] it's just god speaking somebody was on
[1:41:05] their knees
[1:41:07] praying about it and god is speaking to
[1:41:09] them okay
[1:41:11] because that's the stage they're at and
[1:41:13] they have really been seeking
[1:41:15] but guess what even in that god will
[1:41:18] come speak to you if you'll pray too
[1:41:21] and guess what those of us maybe who've
[1:41:23] been in a message
[1:41:24] some from birth i got something to say
[1:41:26] on that too real quick you know people
[1:41:27] always
[1:41:28] want to ask well how long you been in
[1:41:29] the message you know those of us who are
[1:41:33] parents were in the message and well i
[1:41:36] was born in the message
[1:41:39] no you weren't you were not i hate to
[1:41:43] break your bubble
[1:41:44] you were not born in the message you
[1:41:46] know why
[1:41:47] scripture says all have sinned and come
[1:41:50] short of the glory of god
[1:41:52] born in sin shaped in iniquity where
[1:41:55] were you born you were born in sin my
[1:41:57] brother
[1:41:58] you just like the children of israel
[1:42:01] started out in egypt
[1:42:02] now by god's favor and grace
[1:42:05] you were also born into a family that
[1:42:08] gave you a head start out of egypt
[1:42:11] whether or not you took that
[1:42:16] was up to you you either chose to take
[1:42:19] it
[1:42:20] and you at least got into the wilderness
[1:42:21] a lot faster or you stayed in egypt for
[1:42:24] a lot longer than you should have
[1:42:26] and then there's some who come straight
[1:42:28] out of egypt they they didn't have that
[1:42:30] head start
[1:42:31] but they are into the wilderness and
[1:42:33] running through it towards
[1:42:34] the the promised land as fast as they
[1:42:36] can go
[1:42:38] and guess what those who search
[1:42:42] for it the most will get it first
[1:42:45] god doesn't play no games no favorites
[1:42:48] if you were born in a family where at
[1:42:50] least you got the message
[1:42:52] and and the word preached and given to
[1:42:54] you from a young age
[1:42:56] you're privileged okay but if you're not
[1:42:59] digging in
[1:43:00] you're not seeking you're not chasing it
[1:43:04] those who come in yesterday will pass
[1:43:06] you up in a moment
[1:43:09] how how much do you want it that's the
[1:43:11] key
[1:43:12] okay all right how to get that off my
[1:43:15] chest because
[1:43:16] people always ask that and we always are
[1:43:18] like born in the message no you're not
[1:43:20] no you're not so stop that you think
[1:43:24] you were born in a very fortunate
[1:43:26] position
[1:43:29] okay that's it now
[1:43:32] it's up to you to make take advantage of
[1:43:33] that position or not
[1:43:36] okay um oh my
[1:43:40] okay
[1:43:47] all right so we know that the
[1:43:51] promised land is a representation of the
[1:43:53] holy ghost
[1:43:55] and yet even as measure by measure we
[1:43:58] receive it
[1:44:01] the first baptism we stepped on to the
[1:44:02] land we're here
[1:44:04] baptism of the holy ghost now we know
[1:44:07] brother branham says
[1:44:09] he said where are you at now he said
[1:44:11] you're just a babe in christ
[1:44:14] isn't that so contradictory to all the
[1:44:16] denominational teaching
[1:44:18] denominational teaching was you're
[1:44:20] speaking first of all speak in tongues
[1:44:22] you have the holy ghost you have the
[1:44:23] holy ghost you're sealed you're done
[1:44:25] you're over
[1:44:27] well the truth is
[1:44:30] speaking in tongues has very little to
[1:44:32] do with it
[1:44:35] but you received the holy ghost you've
[1:44:38] just
[1:44:38] started you got the first measure
[1:44:42] there is an entire promised land to
[1:44:46] conquer but if you just stay here
[1:44:50] guess what you'll be surrounded by
[1:44:52] enemies until you start taking the next
[1:44:54] step
[1:44:57] and the longer you stay there the longer
[1:44:59] you'll deal with the same enemies
[1:45:00] over and over and over again the same
[1:45:03] temptation you said temtention with the
[1:45:04] holy ghost
[1:45:06] more so you know when you were in the
[1:45:09] wilderness
[1:45:10] they fought only a few battles
[1:45:14] and guess what it was all together
[1:45:16] joshua led them
[1:45:18] and moses stood above them in prayer
[1:45:21] and pretty much god just killed everyone
[1:45:24] in front of them
[1:45:26] hail and whatnot and people just
[1:45:28] dropping it was no real battle
[1:45:30] it was just to make them feel good like
[1:45:32] we're out here
[1:45:34] so they're out running around thinking
[1:45:37] they're doing something
[1:45:38] doing nothing mana is dropping from
[1:45:41] heaven
[1:45:42] they don't have to work for it
[1:45:47] but when you step into the promise
[1:45:50] now you're going to begin fighting like
[1:45:52] never before
[1:45:54] because now it's personal
[1:45:57] if you want it you're going to have to
[1:45:59] take it it's yours
[1:46:00] you have the title deed that's the holy
[1:46:04] ghost
[1:46:05] you have it it's in your hand you're
[1:46:07] looking at it it says
[1:46:08] this property belongs to me
[1:46:13] but isla until you put feet on the
[1:46:15] property
[1:46:16] and kick the squatters off you will
[1:46:19] never
[1:46:20] have the fruits of the land
[1:46:24] and you have to start one enemy at a
[1:46:27] time
[1:46:28] one enemy at a time and keep marching
[1:46:38] okay
[1:46:46] now as we're fighting
[1:46:49] it's important like joshua to always
[1:46:52] keep
[1:46:55] the ministry and the word in its place
[1:46:59] ahead of you if you get in front of the
[1:47:03] word
[1:47:04] you lose your protection stay behind the
[1:47:07] word
[1:47:09] you see that's what happened to the
[1:47:10] children of israel
[1:47:12] when they went after um
[1:47:20] when
[1:47:23] when aiken who had crossed into the
[1:47:26] promise
[1:47:27] he'd made it into the holy ghost
[1:47:30] he'd have the first baptism
[1:47:34] but there were still things of the world
[1:47:35] pulling at him
[1:47:37] you see and when he went in
[1:47:42] and he's fighting the battle he's
[1:47:44] pressing the battle
[1:47:45] there's something in the midst of his
[1:47:47] battle temptation was too great
[1:47:50] and he went and failed to it you know
[1:47:52] that's don't don't look down on aiken
[1:47:55] don't look down naked you know that's
[1:47:56] where adam fell
[1:47:59] adam in that garden of eden
[1:48:04] had entered into the stage walking up to
[1:48:07] adoption he was not at adoption
[1:48:10] he was going to adoption he was walking
[1:48:13] with the lord
[1:48:15] he was learning where he stood on the
[1:48:17] promises
[1:48:19] okay and from that level he fell
[1:48:22] and that's where we find aiken but that
[1:48:27] failing affected the children of israel
[1:48:35] it affected those around him
[1:48:39] you see and those things had to be
[1:48:41] cleaned up
[1:48:42] before they could move on
[1:48:46] so don't think well i got the the holy
[1:48:49] ghost
[1:48:49] i can let my guard down not for a second
[1:48:53] guard goes up higher than ever okay
[1:48:57] don't stop don't pause for a moment not
[1:48:59] to left not to the right
[1:49:01] that's the commission god gave joshua
[1:49:04] in his commission
[1:49:08] do you remember we read it okay
[1:49:12] it says turn not from it what the word
[1:49:16] the message of moses
[1:49:19] to the right hand or to the left that
[1:49:21] thou mayest prosper
[1:49:23] whithersoever thou goest so now we have
[1:49:28] details to what we're supposed to do
[1:49:30] with that message
[1:49:31] said don't don't go to the right don't
[1:49:34] go to the left
[1:49:35] and that message has been the same all
[1:49:38] through scripture all the way up into
[1:49:39] the book of revelations
[1:49:41] where it says do not add nor take away
[1:49:44] one dot or one tittle
[1:49:48] not even a form of punctuation don't
[1:49:51] move it
[1:49:53] not to the right or the left stay down
[1:49:55] the center of the word
[1:49:57] if you're not sure just keep praying
[1:50:00] just keep praying
[1:50:01] he'll reveal it to you
[1:50:04] so the the commission is still the same
[1:50:07] you see here we are we're seeing it's
[1:50:09] the same
[1:50:11] he gave it to joshua christ gave it to
[1:50:14] the disciples
[1:50:15] here we see in the book of revelations
[1:50:17] to us at the end time
[1:50:18] it's all the same it's been the same all
[1:50:21] through scripture he's still
[1:50:24] calling us and saying just stay with the
[1:50:27] word
[1:50:28] that was the vision brother branham saw
[1:50:30] the end time church
[1:50:31] even you know the church the world the
[1:50:34] the church world
[1:50:35] he saw them he said they weren't even
[1:50:38] even in line at all
[1:50:40] it was a rock and roll party the whole
[1:50:42] way through
[1:50:43] but even the chosen bride
[1:50:46] the church of the hour he said there at
[1:50:49] the end he started just getting out of
[1:50:50] line
[1:50:51] he started crying out stay in line stay
[1:50:53] in line stay in line
[1:50:54] stay with the message he didn't yell
[1:50:58] stay with the prophet
[1:50:59] he said stay with the message because
[1:51:01] the message is
[1:51:02] christ okay
[1:51:18] now
[1:51:40] i have multiple quotes here that are
[1:51:44] supporting statements to everything i've
[1:51:46] i've been saying but
[1:51:49] to read everything we'll run out of time
[1:51:53] and that's not necessary you see if i've
[1:51:57] tricked your heart just enough
[1:52:00] to go is there something to what he said
[1:52:03] or maybe you're thinking i don't know i
[1:52:06] don't know if what he's saying is just
[1:52:08] quite right
[1:52:08] that's okay too as long as it drives you
[1:52:12] back
[1:52:13] to the message i don't care where you're
[1:52:17] sitting in your heart right now
[1:52:20] whether your thought is i'm not sure if
[1:52:22] that's right or if your thought is
[1:52:24] i'm pretty sure that's right but until
[1:52:27] you know that you know
[1:52:29] go back to the message because you
[1:52:32] cannot properly sit here in church
[1:52:34] and say amen until you've been to the
[1:52:38] message
[1:52:38] first and you know what you're hearing
[1:52:41] to be the truth because
[1:52:45] that is the meaning of amen so be it
[1:52:48] means
[1:52:50] that's the truth and how can you say
[1:52:53] that's the truth unless you've proven it
[1:52:55] first
[1:52:57] unless you have an understanding of the
[1:52:59] truth how do you know what is true
[1:53:04] you are required brother branham himself
[1:53:08] the prophet of god said you owe it to
[1:53:11] yourself
[1:53:12] now i'm not going to read you the quote
[1:53:14] go find it
[1:53:16] where he said you owe it to yourself not
[1:53:19] just to take my word for it but take it
[1:53:21] back to the scriptures and prove that
[1:53:24] it's true
[1:53:25] why because he's not wanting you to just
[1:53:27] take his word for it he's wanting you to
[1:53:29] have a
[1:53:29] personal relationship with jesus christ
[1:53:32] the joshua of your hour
[1:53:34] so that you can claim the land because
[1:53:35] he knows as you go back to prove that
[1:53:37] it's the truth
[1:53:38] you'll run into more and more promises
[1:53:40] and as you run into more promises you'll
[1:53:42] see what you're missing out on
[1:53:43] as you show what you're missing out on
[1:53:44] you'll know what to claim
[1:53:48] okay so whether you're like yeah i trust
[1:53:51] him
[1:53:51] i think he's telling me the truth don't
[1:53:54] don't do that that's complacency
[1:53:55] that's what the children in the
[1:53:56] wilderness did the whole time yeah moses
[1:53:59] yeah so far he's been right let's
[1:54:02] keep following him every day we come out
[1:54:06] here there's
[1:54:06] more mana one time we complained then we
[1:54:08] had quail
[1:54:11] it's all good seems like a nice guy
[1:54:15] that won't get you any of the promise
[1:54:19] it's a nice life i guess if you like
[1:54:22] moving around a lot and never knowing
[1:54:25] where you're going to be tomorrow
[1:54:26] that's where a lot of people are when
[1:54:28] they're in the wilderness it's one day
[1:54:29] they're saved one day they're lost one
[1:54:31] day they're saved one day they're lost
[1:54:32] one day they're saved
[1:54:34] one day they can make it next day they
[1:54:35] can't one day their bride next day
[1:54:37] well maybe i'm just foolish version if i
[1:54:40] can just make it there i guess that's
[1:54:41] okay
[1:54:44] that's not where we want to stay we've
[1:54:46] all been through those stages all of us
[1:54:48] at one point or another maybe yours was
[1:54:51] very short and someone else was very
[1:54:52] long
[1:54:53] it doesn't make you any better just by
[1:54:56] god's grace
[1:54:59] so keep moving okay but we know
[1:55:04] the key to this is keeping the word in
[1:55:07] its place all right so i'm just going to
[1:55:08] read you
[1:55:09] two last quotes and then we'll we'll
[1:55:11] wrap this up
[1:55:12] um in the law having a shadow 1954
[1:55:15] i think it's the second to the last one
[1:55:17] if you're trying to keep up with me here
[1:55:18] i know i'm
[1:55:19] all over the place
[1:55:24] let's see here and we're just going to
[1:55:26] start from where i
[1:55:27] i don't know if they kept the area where
[1:55:29] i put it in bold but
[1:55:31] about middle of the quote and all of
[1:55:33] god's word
[1:55:34] is written by inspiration there's not a
[1:55:37] contradiction in the entire bible
[1:55:39] if there is i want to see it
[1:55:42] it's nothing in there that's written now
[1:55:45] one
[1:55:46] quick thing i'm just gonna make it real
[1:55:47] quick though because if not i'll just
[1:55:49] branch off and i'll forget where i'm at
[1:55:50] in this quote
[1:55:52] um you see here brother random says if
[1:55:55] there is i want to see it
[1:56:01] he's unafraid you know too many people
[1:56:04] in this message
[1:56:05] and christians of today and ever
[1:56:07] actually
[1:56:08] all across the ages forget just today
[1:56:12] are extremely scared of anyone
[1:56:15] challenging their what they believe
[1:56:19] you know why because they're not fully
[1:56:21] for sure and what they believe they
[1:56:22] haven't entered into the promised land
[1:56:24] they're still wandering on the
[1:56:25] wilderness they're like well it's a
[1:56:26] promise but
[1:56:28] we haven't got there yet maybe maybe
[1:56:30] it's not there
[1:56:31] maybe it's not for us maybe it's not
[1:56:33] true i don't know
[1:56:35] and so when someone comes to him and
[1:56:37] says what is this you believe what's
[1:56:39] this nonsense
[1:56:40] oh oh i don't know yeah i don't i don't
[1:56:43] like talking religion when uh
[1:56:44] with in public or you know i just want
[1:56:48] to
[1:56:48] keep it to myself i know i i don't
[1:56:55] you don't know now maybe you're not
[1:56:58] an evangelist maybe you're not every
[1:57:00] single person you see hey
[1:57:02] hey you know you know jesus christ can
[1:57:04] save you you know jesus christ
[1:57:05] you know the prophet came maybe you're
[1:57:07] not
[1:57:09] maybe you're just that quiet presence
[1:57:12] that god is working through
[1:57:14] that is a lived life maybe we all
[1:57:17] all of us are called to a different
[1:57:18] ministry each and every one of us
[1:57:22] but when you are called to your ministry
[1:57:24] and you know where you stand in the word
[1:57:27] when when the time is right and someone
[1:57:30] comes to you
[1:57:31] and ask you of this hope
[1:57:35] you'll be ready with an answer unafraid
[1:57:39] unafraid because you know where you
[1:57:41] stand
[1:57:42] okay all right all right i'm doing what
[1:57:44] i said i was going to not do
[1:57:46] you prediction like if there is i want
[1:57:49] to see it you see
[1:57:50] no no fear show it to me in fact i'm
[1:57:54] going to search scripture over
[1:57:55] to see if there's a contradiction
[1:57:58] because after i've searched it over if
[1:57:59] someone else comes to me and says hey
[1:58:00] there's a contradiction i'll be like no
[1:58:02] there isn't
[1:58:02] like yeah there is no there isn't how do
[1:58:05] you know
[1:58:06] i've searched the whole thing not one
[1:58:09] and if you would like i'll show you how
[1:58:11] what you think is a contradiction isn't
[1:58:13] because i can show you and take you to
[1:58:15] each step because i've already been
[1:58:17] through it
[1:58:19] okay study to show yourself approved
[1:58:23] right all right
[1:58:26] i want to see it it's nothing in there
[1:58:28] that's written that cannot be
[1:58:30] straightened out by the word of god
[1:58:32] if it's rightly put in its place
[1:58:35] now brother random always used that that
[1:58:37] terminology said if you put it out of
[1:58:39] its place
[1:58:40] you end up with the cow picking grass on
[1:58:42] top of a tree
[1:58:43] you notice how misconstrued that is
[1:58:46] first of all the cow's on the tree but
[1:58:48] now he's picking grass he's not even
[1:58:50] picking leaves
[1:58:52] you're really mixed up it'd be one thing
[1:58:56] if you could somehow get the cow on top
[1:58:58] the tree
[1:58:59] and then at least be eating leaves that
[1:59:01] would make some sense
[1:59:03] but you have a cow picking grass in a
[1:59:06] tree
[1:59:07] none of it makes sense that's how
[1:59:09] confused you are because you don't know
[1:59:11] where you're at or where you're going or
[1:59:12] what you're doing
[1:59:14] why because you're not fighting for it
[1:59:17] you're just okay every day i come to
[1:59:19] church the pastor throws out some mana
[1:59:21] for me
[1:59:22] i take that home it kind of sustains me
[1:59:23] till wednesday and i come back and he
[1:59:25] throws some more mana out for me and i
[1:59:27] take that home
[1:59:28] but one time i didn't make it to church
[1:59:30] in between
[1:59:32] and then the mana started getting moldy
[1:59:33] on me like i really it started wasn't
[1:59:36] making no sense
[1:59:37] and i couldn't figure it out and i was
[1:59:39] like wow maybe i shouldn't even go back
[1:59:40] to that church because
[1:59:41] they're confusing me well yeah you're
[1:59:44] confused
[1:59:45] because church is not the place where
[1:59:47] you learn everything whoa
[1:59:50] you didn't know that did you you thought
[1:59:53] well i go to church and they're going to
[1:59:54] teach me everything i need to know
[1:59:57] no no
[2:00:01] because he said i'll send you the holy
[2:00:04] ghost
[2:00:05] and he will teach you all things now
[2:00:08] he did for those of you who are going to
[2:00:10] get ahead and go wow we don't even need
[2:00:11] church the holy ghost to teach me
[2:00:12] everything
[2:00:14] slow down the holy ghost himself
[2:00:18] put the ministry in place
[2:00:21] in the church to teach the church now
[2:00:25] if you get the holy ghost guess what
[2:00:29] you're gonna need the ministry to teach
[2:00:31] you hey
[2:00:32] the way you're dressing you shouldn't do
[2:00:34] that sister is cutting your hair
[2:00:36] don't do that why because you're going
[2:00:39] to take the holy ghost
[2:00:41] take this message you're going to dig
[2:00:43] through the quotes
[2:00:45] you're going to get down you're going to
[2:00:46] read the scriptures you're going to find
[2:00:48] them
[2:00:48] and you're going to say lord reveal to
[2:00:50] me
[2:00:51] why this is so i'm not gonna follow it
[2:00:54] because this is what i'm told to do
[2:00:56] i'm not gonna just follow it because
[2:00:57] this is our way of life i'm not gonna
[2:00:59] just follow it because this is what the
[2:01:00] church says i'm not gonna follow it just
[2:01:01] because this is what the pastor said
[2:01:03] i'm not even gonna follow it just
[2:01:04] because that's what the prophet said but
[2:01:08] i'm gonna take
[2:01:09] it all the way back to the word and ask
[2:01:11] god to reveal it to me myself
[2:01:14] so that i know that i know that i know
[2:01:17] okay so we put the word rightly in place
[2:01:21] but we'll never do it by man's
[2:01:23] understanding never
[2:01:24] you'll never be able to just figure it
[2:01:26] out okay
[2:01:28] the holy spirit wrote the bible and the
[2:01:31] holy spirit is the only one who can
[2:01:33] interpret the bible and he will give it
[2:01:35] to us as
[2:01:36] we have need as you're going through
[2:01:38] your walk and your stage of life
[2:01:41] god will reveal it to you as you search
[2:01:43] it out
[2:01:44] do you have a desire to search it out
[2:01:46] he'll reveal it to you
[2:01:48] just start searching take on a step
[2:01:51] take one more step why because will adam
[2:01:53] told he said
[2:01:54] the the parable he gave us just like
[2:01:56] jesus gave parables
[2:01:58] the prophet came to us and spoke to us
[2:01:59] in the same way the parable of the man
[2:02:01] with the lantern
[2:02:03] and they asked him he said well how do
[2:02:06] you know where you're going
[2:02:07] through these dark woods he said i have
[2:02:08] this lantern he said well
[2:02:11] can you see where you're going he said
[2:02:13] no but as i move the
[2:02:15] light moves with me and i can see just
[2:02:16] one more step at a time
[2:02:18] one more step at a time don't don't try
[2:02:20] and figure it all out
[2:02:22] just take one more step as you take that
[2:02:24] step a little more light on your path
[2:02:26] will show just keep moving don't stop
[2:02:29] don't don't hunker down keep moving
[2:02:32] don't do
[2:02:33] like most of the church world throughout
[2:02:35] the ages have done
[2:02:36] brother iran said they took the gospel
[2:02:40] on what they thought it was and they put
[2:02:42] a period on the end
[2:02:43] full stop
[2:02:46] and they said that's it that's the
[2:02:48] revelation
[2:02:50] and you know that's where many of us
[2:02:51] find ourselves today we've read the
[2:02:53] message perhaps
[2:02:54] we've read a scripture our favorite
[2:02:56] minister preached it a certain way
[2:02:59] and we go there it is that's the answer
[2:03:01] that is what
[2:03:03] that quote and that scripture means and
[2:03:05] then we sit down
[2:03:06] done close close our bible close up the
[2:03:09] message
[2:03:10] we know what that means no need to press
[2:03:12] on and then
[2:03:13] you know maybe a week later a year later
[2:03:15] 10 years later 30 years later
[2:03:17] someone comes along and and picks up
[2:03:19] that quote and reads that
[2:03:21] that scripture and preaches it from a
[2:03:23] whole another angle
[2:03:25] and you are so set in your ways
[2:03:28] we are so set in our ways and we go no
[2:03:31] no can't be false doctrine
[2:03:35] no no stop it
[2:03:42] the scripture is never ending as he
[2:03:44] reveals it there's more and more
[2:03:46] we could read one line out of one verse
[2:03:50] and if we just took that one and that's
[2:03:52] all we had
[2:03:53] we would never end of things to minister
[2:03:57] on and revelation to be had
[2:03:59] because his word is without end and so
[2:04:02] how how
[2:04:05] arrogant of you how arrogant of me
[2:04:10] to think that we have the full
[2:04:11] revelation
[2:04:13] of even one bit of the scripture
[2:04:16] and we have some type of copyright
[2:04:20] to that scripture where no one else can
[2:04:22] touch it
[2:04:23] we've got it you want access to it right
[2:04:26] here
[2:04:28] come to me if you try and take it in any
[2:04:30] other way
[2:04:33] you're in trouble stop it
[2:04:37] god is gonna come to each individual
[2:04:40] he didn't come outside the walls of
[2:04:43] jericho
[2:04:44] to joshua in a fiery burning bush
[2:04:49] he didn't but if we judged him by
[2:04:51] moses's
[2:04:52] experience word for word
[2:04:56] we'd say uh-uh no way a man
[2:05:00] you saw a man who claimed to be god
[2:05:05] you saw god don't you know the scripture
[2:05:07] says no man shall see his face
[2:05:11] joshua you have lost it
[2:05:15] you saw him you talked to him you
[2:05:17] challenged him to battle
[2:05:20] yeah he wasn't the first
[2:05:23] jacob was at least that we have
[2:05:26] knowledge of he wrestled
[2:05:30] with the angel with that pillar of fire
[2:05:33] until it gave him his inheritance
[2:05:38] if he hadn't there would have been no
[2:05:40] inheritance for jacob who was jacob
[2:05:42] israel so here we see
[2:05:46] the taking of the land
[2:05:50] is from all this time back the promise
[2:05:53] to abraham
[2:05:54] and then jacob wrestling for the promise
[2:05:59] and now it's coming 400 years later
[2:06:02] it's coming to pass maybe there's times
[2:06:05] when we'll wrestle
[2:06:06] we'll go round and round and we'll be
[2:06:08] given a promise
[2:06:11] you may not see that promise come to
[2:06:12] fruition
[2:06:14] for 400 years so hopefully they come up
[2:06:16] with better medicine
[2:06:20] but that's where abraham was too
[2:06:23] he wandered through his wilderness he
[2:06:26] got called out of
[2:06:27] a pagan land
[2:06:30] he had to leave his family he wanders
[2:06:33] through the wilderness all over the
[2:06:34] place
[2:06:35] he gets lost a few times he ends up in a
[2:06:37] few of the wrong places
[2:06:38] until finally hits the place where god
[2:06:41] can use him
[2:06:42] and he's ready to enter into adoption
[2:06:46] you see it's the same it's the same no
[2:06:47] matter which story you pick up
[2:06:49] you'll find it's the same so if it's the
[2:06:52] same for all of them it's the same for
[2:06:53] us don't go read the bible claim it
[2:06:59] begin to read it as if wow um
[2:07:02] my okay that's what god did there
[2:07:07] how does that how is that represented in
[2:07:09] my life
[2:07:11] and if i don't see i'm at the promised
[2:07:13] land yet okay am i
[2:07:14] am i still kind of leaving egypt no
[2:07:18] well i think maybe i've got across the
[2:07:20] red sea
[2:07:21] i'm that far okay i'm learning some
[2:07:25] church order all right now i know where
[2:07:26] i need to go
[2:07:28] that's okay it's okay
[2:07:32] what's important is to identify where
[2:07:33] you're at right now because if you don't
[2:07:35] know where you're at
[2:07:36] you'll never get where you're going
[2:07:40] okay no
[2:07:53] all right one last thing i want to
[2:07:56] just show you real quick
[2:07:59] um you say well you've typed out
[2:08:04] egypt the wilderness and the promised
[2:08:06] land is
[2:08:07] justification sanctification baptism of
[2:08:09] the holy ghost
[2:08:10] different stages that god's working in
[2:08:12] our lives in all of us
[2:08:13] at different times and points but you
[2:08:17] know there's a there's a type in the new
[2:08:18] testament too
[2:08:19] because we know brother brandon
[2:08:20] preachers he preaches on and he said
[2:08:22] joshua
[2:08:23] types is a type of ephesus ephesus is
[2:08:26] in is the new joshua is the old
[2:08:29] testament version of
[2:08:30] ephesus the ephesian church right
[2:08:33] entering into the promises so if
[2:08:36] ephesians
[2:08:37] is the type of joshua then there has to
[2:08:40] be types of egypt
[2:08:41] and of the wilderness and
[2:08:45] you'll find that scriptures are not just
[2:08:49] written the way they're written for a
[2:08:50] purpose but even the books
[2:08:52] are placed where they're placed with
[2:08:54] purpose everything god does is with a
[2:08:56] purpose
[2:08:57] okay and you'll find the two books
[2:09:00] leading up to ephesians
[2:09:02] are corinthians and galatians now i'm
[2:09:05] going to give you a few little nuggets
[2:09:07] you go dig into these books and read
[2:09:08] them and find out
[2:09:10] i already have and i'll do it again and
[2:09:13] again because there's more in there
[2:09:16] but in the book of corinthians paul
[2:09:18] comes to him
[2:09:19] and the first thing he does is he starts
[2:09:21] trying to correct them
[2:09:23] they're everyone is got their own thing
[2:09:26] going on
[2:09:27] um they are in
[2:09:30] a stage of division
[2:09:34] they don't know who's following who
[2:09:37] everyone has a favorite pastor
[2:09:40] one some of them are claiming to follow
[2:09:41] the prophet paul
[2:09:43] and he's better than your pastor and i'm
[2:09:45] not having nothing to do with your
[2:09:47] pastor
[2:09:48] and what you guys believe isn't right
[2:09:50] and
[2:09:51] on top of that there all this arguing
[2:09:53] about what is right what isn't right
[2:09:55] who's pastor is better
[2:09:56] and they're missing all that they can't
[2:09:57] even see their own in front you know in
[2:10:00] front of their
[2:10:01] own two eyes to see their their nose as
[2:10:03] you would say
[2:10:04] because right in the middle of their
[2:10:05] church they not only even
[2:10:08] think it's anything wrong with it
[2:10:09] there's a there's a man who's
[2:10:11] in a relationship with his own mother
[2:10:14] which i think if you go back take it
[2:10:16] back into scripture it wasn't his
[2:10:18] biological mother but it was his
[2:10:20] father's wife
[2:10:22] and no one is concerned about that the
[2:10:24] sin in the church
[2:10:26] just well my my pastor is right and your
[2:10:29] pastor is wrong
[2:10:31] my church is better than your church
[2:10:33] that's the stage the corinthian church
[2:10:34] was in
[2:10:36] they're stuck in there they're not even
[2:10:38] out of egypt
[2:10:40] arguing about who's who's church and
[2:10:42] who's pastor and who did right and who's
[2:10:44] baptized by who and
[2:10:46] and this nonsense
[2:10:50] and we get over to the the book of
[2:10:52] galatians the church there
[2:10:54] okay they got things a little bit more
[2:10:55] straightened out they got no one living
[2:10:57] in sin
[2:10:58] in in adultery at least they got some
[2:11:01] things figured out
[2:11:02] um but
[2:11:06] their first thing paul does is he goes
[2:11:08] hey guys
[2:11:10] it sure didn't take you guys long from
[2:11:12] the time that i
[2:11:14] spoke it to you actually if you could
[2:11:15] put up galatians
[2:11:17] 1 and verse 8 that would be great
[2:11:21] but in just a short period of time you
[2:11:24] guys are all running off
[2:11:25] after weird and strange doctrines
[2:11:27] everyone's got his own interpretation
[2:11:29] he said what happened if you could put
[2:11:32] up uh galatians one and eight
[2:11:39] okay and here's his rebuke to them to
[2:11:42] try and straighten them out
[2:11:44] but though we or an angel from heaven
[2:11:47] preach any other gospel unto you
[2:11:49] then that's which we have preached unto
[2:11:51] you let him be accursed
[2:11:53] he said i'm putting this all to a stop
[2:11:55] real quick
[2:11:57] so they've made it out into the
[2:11:58] wilderness
[2:12:00] but their church order their
[2:12:01] understanding of the word is just all
[2:12:03] over the place
[2:12:07] then if you take and you step into the
[2:12:09] book of ephesians
[2:12:11] paul begins speaking to the church and
[2:12:14] he just begins greeting them
[2:12:15] and what a pleasure it is to speak to
[2:12:17] them and by the fifth
[2:12:19] verse he is straight into his message
[2:12:22] on adoption of sons and daughters of god
[2:12:26] see this is a church who's in order
[2:12:28] who's ready
[2:12:29] to move on to adoption they're ready
[2:12:33] they set themselves in order they're not
[2:12:35] following some weird doctrine they're in
[2:12:36] the message
[2:12:38] they're in the holy ghost and now
[2:12:41] they're ready to take the land
[2:12:43] step by step word by word
[2:12:46] you see it's the same thing playing out
[2:12:50] and within our lives we'll all go
[2:12:52] through a stage of the corinthian church
[2:12:54] we've all gone through a stage of the
[2:12:56] galatian church and now
[2:12:58] hopefully at some point we're reaching
[2:13:00] that stage of the ephesian church
[2:13:02] where we're stepping into the word we're
[2:13:04] stepping into that adoption
[2:13:05] we're stepping to that place we're
[2:13:06] saying lord if you can use me
[2:13:08] anyway i'm yours father let me be a
[2:13:12] surrendered vessel
[2:13:14] lord i'm not worried what whatever
[2:13:16] wherever you want to have me
[2:13:17] to be a blessing that's where i want to
[2:13:19] go whatever church
[2:13:21] whatever pastor or leadership you want
[2:13:23] to put over me that's fine i'm okay with
[2:13:25] that
[2:13:25] whatever you know however you would
[2:13:28] desire to lead me lord
[2:13:30] that's where i want to be and saints
[2:13:32] that's where we want to come to
[2:13:34] not this infighting not not all the
[2:13:38] nonsense of the world around us
[2:13:40] we we want to come out of egypt we want
[2:13:43] to come out of the wilderness
[2:13:45] that experience was good but there's
[2:13:49] more
[2:13:50] as we enter into the promise there's
[2:13:52] more and it's
[2:13:53] never ending there's never anything just
[2:13:56] you got to keep fighting
[2:13:57] you got to keep pressing get into the
[2:13:59] word
[2:14:00] if the musicians would want to come
[2:14:12] saints
[2:14:16] if you want it there's more there for
[2:14:18] you
[2:14:20] don't read your bible once and feel like
[2:14:23] you've read it all
[2:14:25] you've missed so much and i don't say
[2:14:27] because you're not a good reader
[2:14:29] or you don't have a good understanding
[2:14:32] it's just
[2:14:33] not all of it could be revealed to you
[2:14:35] at one time
[2:14:37] it's impossible
[2:14:41] but he's only able to reveal to you
[2:14:45] as you have desired to know you see he's
[2:14:50] he is hampered
[2:14:55] by your either belief or unbelief at any
[2:14:58] stage in your walk
[2:15:01] you either believe there's nothing more
[2:15:03] there to be found
[2:15:04] or you believe it's endless if you
[2:15:06] believe there's nothing more to be found
[2:15:08] you won't find anything you could be
[2:15:11] surrounded
[2:15:12] by the most wonderful treasure
[2:15:17] but if you didn't believe there was any
[2:15:19] treasure to be found you would never see
[2:15:21] it
[2:15:21] you'll walk right by it you won't even
[2:15:24] see it
[2:15:25] you could you could step on it you
[2:15:27] wouldn't know what it was there
[2:15:28] you did oh tripped another stone here
[2:15:32] and you just went over a precious gem
[2:15:37] but if you're searching you'll be
[2:15:38] looking wow look it
[2:15:41] i think there's something more there it
[2:15:42] is i found it you go you pick it up
[2:15:44] you'll treasure that
[2:15:46] you put that away and you think wow if
[2:15:48] there was something more here there's
[2:15:49] got to be something
[2:15:50] more somewhere else you know keep
[2:15:52] searching keep searching
[2:15:54] keep searching never stop searching
[2:15:55] saints never stop
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:09] they wait upon the lord
[2:16:30] christmas
