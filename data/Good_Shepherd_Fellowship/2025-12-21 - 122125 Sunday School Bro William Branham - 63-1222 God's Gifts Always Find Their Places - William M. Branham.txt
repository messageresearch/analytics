========================================

to talk to you on the word of the Lord. And um so brother Neville asked me and I had several little Christmas texts that I've been using. One of them up at Phoenix and down at Tucson, different places around there, a regular Christmas message. And I thought tonight I'll just speak on a little something here that the Lord put up on my mind recently as I was up in Colorado and I was thinking on something at Christmas time and I got about five or six of the little jotss wrote down here scriptures and things that I don't I guess brother Neville all ministers do that you seem like something comes to you and you jot it down wait a while you put it down I put on a tablet of paper just on a tablet of paper then when I called on sometime I look back and say what was this now got a hold of and that's way when we were called real quick you know used to be I when I was younger I could just my mind was so I could just think this right now and I didn't have to wait I think 10 days ago I was at certain certain place that's the texture it is here it goes you know since I've passed a few milestones brother Hagen bottom and crossed a few rivers that it just don't come that way no more getting a little far up the road but as brother Neville said a while ago we're getting closer &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Closer home. It's good to be back home. I coming back while awful snowy and is here the accidents and things. So many of them on the road and people being killed and just think how many hundreds will lose their life now between tonight and after New Year's. How many Americans will die &gt;&gt; and you know some of us might be right here tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it just depends on now that our condition before God. It's a sad nation. This brother said sadness everywhere and our flag has been hanging 30 days half mass all because of sin and people who would not accept God's way of of of things. Even if we can disagree with a person, if we can't yet do it in a brotherly way and then see if Christ is in the heart then no matter how much you disagree with a man, you've still got love for him and respect. I disagree with many man times, but still I've never seen one that I disagree with that I ever thought of any more than put my arm around him and call him my brother and try to help him as best I could. I disagree with him because that I think maybe that upon disagreeing that he what he believes that I might not believe just like him, but uh and so forth and I might try to project my way to him as he projects his to me and get them together, comb out and see what we got. But a disagreement like that just far as it comes to we should never get angry or want to hurt or destroy or anything. We should always be trying to build up. Got a cold spell going on here, haven't we? &gt;&gt; 72 when I left Tucson and uh when the sun went down, got dark, it's still 69. So they come back up here. I'm just a shivering all up. uh all that snowy road and below zero and ice and everything. I get all used to it again. It's so strange how you can get so climatized. It's such a a little way. And since I left you, I didn't have hardly a chance to get survived up. I got a like a sinus in the weather in here. And as I get older and I was born and raised in here, but when you see when you're young, you got something you throw off. But when you get older, well, you begin to find out that something isn't there. It used to be you could just forget about it. You there's something there that that just won't throw off like it did when he was a kid. So, uh find out that way that I climb for an old man kind of helps a little bit. I remember coming down that Guna Pike up there as a kid 7 8 10 12 14 years old. No shoes on. tennis shoes dip eight or 10 below zero and tennis shoes the toes out of them and not now ain't walking down like the street year but busting the snow there's no automobiles come down might be a wagon track once in a while come down that highway of a morning little old coat on no shirt and it pinned up like this no more than what I got on right now soaking wet to my knees go right on in and pay no attention to it see hardly have a cold but that was about 45 years ago so whole lot of weeks he's gone a lot of miles and build up on this theometer, you know. So, we just don't take it like we used to. I see brother Cats raised his head up. You're too young to think now. Wait till you get up where brother Neville and I are and then then you'll you'll think a lot of things. We can sound. Well, we've had great times in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord has blessed us tremendously and I'm so thankful and I come back I think next Sunday the Lord willing I if brother Neville doesn't care &gt;&gt; I got a service at least Sunday morning and maybe Sunday night a healing service for Sunday night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sunday morning we got an important message that the Lord be willing for me to deliver it. I haven't thought up my text no more than just my text yet. no context to it because I I am not without without any you know revelation from the Lord but just in myself. Uh I want to express something Sunday that I hope will kind of help out a little bit along these ways. Uh I've got to go down into the field and I've got just every day almost taken up everywhere. I think Billy was telling me one of the itinerary that I got two or three days that I could come home in April after I leave here, go back to Tucson. That's about settled then. And then on till next November, October when I get back this side again from overseas. Now two more days till one more day is be Monday. T is Tuesday's Christmas Eve. Tuesday is Christmas Eve. Is it awful to see that this great holiday that we're approaching is approached in the manner that is approached in? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's such a pitiful thing, such a a rational thing to think that that rabbits and a a myth called Chris Crinkle, Santa Claus, and everything has taken the real value away from what Christmas is. Now, we don't we We don't know and I certainly do not believe I just coming down wife back there and I coming down the road was listening on an astronomer that now they just fell on the idea which an astronomer told me many many years ago when I was just a game warden here in Indiana when they told me that how those stars came together just like that first astronomer did and that form what they said would be a natural thing that happens everybody said night 800 years or something like that and it reforms itself again of Sardis and Jupiter and I forget Mark Meyers or I know that's wrong it's some the stars how they speed when they cross their orbits in line of the earth and this astronomer tonight was trying to tell that it actually was a natural thing I I don't I don't accept that I believe it was a supernatural &gt;&gt; Amend things is supernatural with God he is supernatural &gt;&gt; and um and I look down and know that this is facing back now to April, I go, "Lord, willing for me to live that long, I'd be 55 years old." Then I I know the uh but looking back on my life and I wonder where it happened from that first little Christmases when we hang up her stockings and mama would get we probably get an orange and and two or three little pieces of striped candy and that was a great Christmas to us. But you know the kids they they look forward for them gifts. We we find out that that Christmas is to the is mainly children. They they look forward to that nowadays. It is turned off to the children, but it really should be adults. &gt;&gt; It should be a teaching of children what real Christmas is. &gt;&gt; And I totally do not believe that that Christ could be born on a 25th day of December in Judea because it's colder than it is out here now. See, and how could the shepherds be keeping their flocks for night and and then the taxation and everything and Mary having to come that far from way down in Bethlehem up into Judea up into Jerusalem or other for the taxation. I I I hardly could could uh could believe that or come up. I believe she come to Nazareth and so um when how that that could be done, it could not be uh be done. But u I believe that Christ was born in a spring because in every way he was a lamb. They you notice he was born in a barn and not a house. And when they took him to the cross, the others, as far as we know, they never said about him leading them, but they led him. Did you know a lamb or sheep has to be led to the slaughter? &gt;&gt; It it will not go to the slaughter. You you have to lead it there. And usually it's a goat that leads the sheep and and the killing pins. They have a goat and the goat will walk up this runway to gets up to get the sheep started down the runway to be killed and the goat will jump out. But when they come a time to go kill the goat, he really kicks up a bus and he has to go in. Of course, you couldn't blame him. But but it's a a thing how a sheep has to be led. And he was led to the slaughter. They led him. He was a lamb. And I believe in that way being allto together nature. And lambs are born in March, April, and somewhere along in there, not later than May. And I don't believe it was anything before March and anything after May. sometime along in there. But when uh the church Christianity was married into Romanism was at the NASA council when they accepted the Roman uh uh nation accepted the Christianity and made what they call the universal religion was Christianity. They made the universal religion and they worshiped idols and they had a sun god. And right now from the from the 21st to the 25th, the sun almost stands in its same track as it's passing. What do you call that? Um, you know, I thought I knew it, but I can't think of when the suns is it gains so much time and loses so much time until the 21st between 21st and 25th December. I forget what they call it. What? No. No. The eclipse is when it passes, the sun and moon passes together. It's a something in there. Oh, I I I can almost see it but can't right now. However, it's that stand still of the sun which is called by the Romans. That's when the circus went on. It was called the sun god's birthday. They celebrated it from the 21st to the 25th of December. So then being that this was converted Rome into a Christianity was accepted in their way in Rome then they said we'll make the same celebration and pay son of God's birthday see the son god Jupiter's birthday then son of god's birthday 25th of December and that but what difference does it make see today when we are even if it's If it's doing it in July or August or whenever it might be, it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us the hope that we have in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And now you say, "Well, the rest of them is all Santa Claus and going all." Well, we just might as well do it. No, sir. No. This is not a pagan celebration to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a sacred hour. If there had been no Christmas, there would been no resurrection. And if there had been no Christmas, there had been no love. There had been no peace. There had been no hereafter for the a believer. If there had been no Christmas, and now you say, well, if the rest of the world, they just Well, see, the lightning and the black cloudy sky show that there can be light in the time of darkness. &gt;&gt; These lights tonight prove that &gt;&gt; that there can be light in the time of darkness. And when does light shine its best? In darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. You turn these lights on, daytime, sun's shining in, you hardly notice they're on. But just one little wee light will shine real bright in a time of darkness. And right now is a darkness when every Christian should give a testimony of the hope that's in him. Jesus Christ, the son of God, &gt;&gt; not some Chris Crinkle that was born back on some kind of a tree lit up, went out through a forest one night. Some fiction story. There's no bottom to it. But we believe solidly on the promised word of God of a coming Messiah and he was born on Christmas day 20 or 2,000 years ago we believe. So tonight we're going to speak a little bit on a different way. I guess your pastor's already spoken and probably speak Wednesday night again. Uh because I I know he laid back some text or something that gave me this platform tonight and I want him to bring it. I want to listen to him. But just before now we do this, let's just bow our heads again for a moment of prayer. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, this great sacred moment when we think of the different things in the scripture here that everywhere we go back in the Old Testament speaks of that day when God shall send his son. how those prophets back there allotted their time for prophecy of the word of God to come to them. And they prophesied in their days and fortold the things that would come to pass. And we see it all met there in Bethlehem that night when God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. We thank thee for this. And now Lord, tonight as we settle down here to to speak on thy word, and it's so sacred, Lord, that's the reason we like to speak to you first. And we ask that you'll open our understanding to thy word. In Jesus' name we ask it. Amen. I want to read some scripture here. Just a regular Christmas story for the scripture found in and uh Matthew the 2 chapter. And while you're turned that in, John 3:16. And uh the other night up at Phoenix, if you tape people here, listen to the tapes. Uh likely listen to that one. Why Jesus had to come to Bethlehem? Why did he have to do it? And those symbols there of David laying and and wait up on the mountain looking down and seeing the Philistine army garrisoned. And I compared that with exactly today and find out that Bethlehem what it means. And Christ is our Bethlehem and can prove that every man that's born of God is born in Bethlehem because Christ is Bethlehem is that's what he was the bread of life. And Beth B means means house. Eel is God and Elhhem is elim which means uh bread and house of God's bread and Jesus Christ was the house of God's bread of eternal life and every man that's born into Christ you're born into Bethlehem God's house of bread and how that the leagues of these churches today is garrison like Philistines to keep the people from and how that those gallant men knowing that David was anointed and was going to come king someday very unpopular then because he was a fugitive among his people but one day his call come they had gallop man with him and remember those men were gentiles most every one of them were gentile a very beautiful type of today and one man was so gallant he killed 800 men with one with his spear himself in one day another one standing the field little and an army come up a troop and all of them run and he stood there and slew man until his arms was tired and then another one how he jumped into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day single-handed and a full or an Egyptian run at him with a long spear and he took a stick and knocked this spear out of his hand took the spear and killed the Egyptian himself and killed 300 captains and get a great man David crying out if I could drink once more see from that well Sorry. Get a great man David crying out if I could drink once more. See from that well where he used to water his sheep when he went out of a morning from the corral they want a drink of water and these men pulled their swords and fought through 15 miles a man brought this water back and David said far be that I drink it and he poured it upon the ground as a drink offering to the Lord what a beautiful type of the same thing of this John 3:16 tonight God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and what did Christ do the life that he had to live eternally. He poured it up on the ground from his veins, his natural life upon the ground as a sin offering for us. And how the Gentiles today, man of honor, man, great man, taking the sword and standing there and cutting their way through to get a fresh drink of water for Christ. Our David which is very unpopular today but our David which we know is coming in power and going to every nation under his feet like that and root him with an rod of iron and real gallant man standing with the word of God and chopping from side to side fearlessly because we know he's coming in power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read now after John 3:16. Let's read the visit of the magi of St. Matthew the 2 chapter. Now when Jesus is born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold there came wise men from the from the east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he that's born, King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him?" When Herod the king heard these things, he was troubled in all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered the chief priests and the scribes of the people together, he demanded them where Christ should be born, they said unto him, of Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah, art thou not the least among the princes of Judah? Out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel." Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. And when you have found him, bring me word again that I may come and worship him also." When they heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and fell down and worshiped him. And they had opened their treasures. They presented to him gifts, gold of frankincense, and marrow. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not depart, they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. Very strange here. How that God in a lesser way, God does speak to people through dreams. I believe that. But how that God in this case used uh secondarily. Now a dream is a dream if it's interpreted rightly. It is a same as a vision. If it's a dream and being interpreted, God's used it since way back in the Old Testament and down through the ages and promised in the last days to use it again. how people can overeat and and so forth and get nightmares and it's not it's not real spiritual dreams that don't ring up when it when you read it. And some of it might seem right, but yet there's real spiritual dreams. And we know here at the tabernacle, God gives people dreams and they are interpreted and they come to pass and they're real. But it's a secondary way of doing it. See now the reason it was done then it was because there was no prophet in the land at that time to interpret the dream. See there was no prophet to interpret the dreams like Joseph and and Daniel and those prophets of old. They had had a prophet for 400 years. And God used a dream to for the welfare of his own child. He did. He told Joseph when he was a just man, not willingly to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately. No doubt she told him the visit of Gabriel and so forth and what he had said, but when he saw her to be mother, it was too unusual. You know, it just it was something very different. And you know, that's what's the matter today. God does things unusual and is so unusual till even just man can't see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joseph couldn't understand it. He was too unusual. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he was a good man. Nothing wrong with him. He was a good man, a just man, but it was so unusual. See, Joseph probably 40 years old or 45, something like that they claim when he and Mary was engaged. But here we find something that never had happened. A woman exposed to this man and yet be found to be mother. And it was so unusual. Joseph was mighty to put her away. But right at that crucial moment, God sent his angel and appeared to him in a dream and said, "Don't fear to take thee, Mary, thy wife, for that which is conceived in her of the Holy Ghost." What a newborn faith Joseph must have had when he rose up in there. See, he never had need any interpretation. The dream wasn't symbols. It was right straight out. Don't fear to take Mary thy wife. For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. There's no prophet to give the interpretation. So it had to come directly right straight like that to God from God to Joseph. Now God taking that secondarily away. What does it teach us right here before we hit our text? Here's what it teaches us that God can use every faculty of our being if it's commit surrendered to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can use our mind, our dreams, our subconscious, our first conscious, our tongue, our songs, our eyes, our everything that we have can be used of God if it's committed to God. See, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that you are committed to God, he'll use every outlet and every part of you, he'll use it. No matter what it is, he'll use it if it's sanctified to his purpose and call. &gt;&gt; Our Lord help. &gt;&gt; Now, tonight we're going to speak on gifts. I want.
