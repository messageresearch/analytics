[32:41] in His grace we want to grow amen praise
[32:45] the Lord Allah bless you have your seat
[32:47] a little bit let's just bring our
[32:49] greetings and announcement and then we
[32:51] just go to the word this morning is good
[32:54] to be in the house of the Lord amen
[32:56] praise the Lord and the week was a
[33:08] little bit busy for us most especially
[33:12] coming to the weekend and but we want to
[33:16] thank the law for bringing us through
[33:18] the weekend Amen sister terrorists who
[33:21] have left the hospital yesterday but
[33:25] there was a little bit of a concern so
[33:29] she she had to stay back to see the
[33:33] doctor this morning so probably maybe
[33:38] this evening or tomorrow she'll be out
[33:40] of the hospital but the baby is doing
[33:42] well amen the concern was more with the
[33:46] mother than the baby so we thank the
[33:49] Lord for that in a way praise the Lord
[33:52] amen on Friday morning we were just
[33:57] about praying in the housing and sister
[34:01] teach call and she got a call from the
[34:05] doctor and so kind to prepare herself
[34:10] for the possibly surgery that day so we
[34:13] got a little bit anxious you know that's
[34:16] why we're always kicking you get answers
[34:18] and then you get a little bit nervous
[34:21] and all of that so we got answers in and
[34:25] we started you know doing everything and
[34:28] calling around and
[34:31] and I've not left for work that morning
[34:32] so I called him and told him I'll be
[34:36] coming in late in an order there so and
[34:39] we spoke to her a little bit we prayed
[34:42] and but then he had to do one evaluation
[34:47] of everything the labor and all of that
[34:54] and it was still I think maybe 2 3 p.m.
[35:01] when I call her an access she called if
[35:04] she heard back from the doctor and and
[35:07] she said no then I said well you call
[35:09] because you have now eating since this
[35:11] morning and you have taken medication so
[35:14] call them and find out what's going on
[35:16] if you can be able to snack on something
[35:19] or drink water whatever it is and then
[35:22] she called and then then it turned out
[35:28] to be that there was someone on on the
[35:33] list before her that had to go into
[35:36] soldering so but then I told her you
[35:41] know justjust in the morning when I was
[35:43] talking to her I said well you know you
[35:48] know God is the healer you know and as
[35:52] the doctors are doing the evaluation god
[35:56] we have to make sure that it is his
[35:59] proper match so and God always give his
[36:04] children the best so if there was now
[36:08] for her there was not the best take it
[36:11] like that and stay with it take your
[36:15] mind from every word and just stay with
[36:17] me that God always gave his children the
[36:20] best so but it was a kind of you know a
[36:28] cannibal one of those days let me say
[36:32] like that it was one of those days but
[36:34] we thank the Lord that she's she's doing
[36:37] where she was to go for a procedure this
[36:41] morning so my wife took her in and
[36:44] brother Stephen would meet read them
[36:47] there and then she'll come from there to
[36:49] church so we just pray that the grace of
[36:52] God will continue to strengthen our
[36:54] sister amen and we all want to be
[36:57] positive we all want to prepare
[37:00] ourselves amen you know I was thinking
[37:03] that just like I said on Wednesday night
[37:06] to have a tense giving service and there
[37:09] were just so many things and we have to
[37:12] be thankful for
[37:13] amen and there was one of the things
[37:16] that I thought we would have celebrated
[37:18] Thanksgiving weekend you know because
[37:21] the the thing about it there is that
[37:24] sister quiches she's the situation and
[37:28] and we have to deal with the situation
[37:31] amen so we are all in it together amen
[37:34] and that is the reason why we bring you
[37:36] all of this reporting and that is the
[37:38] reason why you know we ask for your
[37:42] prayers and and we ask you to you know
[37:47] create an atmosphere of faith and just
[37:53] just believing that like Paul said when
[37:56] one of the bodies suffer the whole
[37:58] entire body suffer amen and I wonder if
[38:02] he wanted the body rejoice the whole
[38:04] entire body rejoice so we are suffering
[38:07] for now but we know we will rejoice
[38:09] amen and and I thought about it that
[38:12] evening I said well you know because
[38:16] brother Branham says science has break
[38:19] into doors laboratory so what if the
[38:21] doctor I calling her you know it's an
[38:25] earthly sign that heaven is already
[38:27] ready amen
[38:28] maybe he could bypass the doctors amen
[38:30] so and that's why we we are on an
[38:34] expectation for I don't know how you
[38:36] feel but I just feel so good to see the
[38:39] things that God is doing amen around our
[38:42] life even around there
[38:44] they're assembling and the only thing I
[38:47] can invite you I can invite you to enjoy
[38:49] the moment
[38:52] praise the Lord amen you might not have
[38:57] you know these services or these
[39:01] atmospheres and I appreciate the song
[39:04] the sisters sang you know and just the
[39:08] different things that God is doing you
[39:10] know around the Assembly enjoy the
[39:13] moment don't sit back and be the
[39:15] spectator as you miss something
[39:17] important you know so let's let's be
[39:20] part of it let's enjoy it together and
[39:24] so we are very grateful and we will
[39:29] continue to pray for our sister and pray
[39:33] for all of our loved ones but a scared
[39:35] and then update on brother David okay
[39:42] okay maybe I think he's just getting
[39:45] rest but we can believe that he's doing
[39:47] better okay
[39:51] praise the Lord he won't trust alone for
[39:54] that also
[39:55] so just like we announcer on the I think
[40:00] is their worst mine date here the
[40:03] weekend before Thanksgiving we will have
[40:07] our brother brother there war with us
[40:09] since he couldn't campaigns give him
[40:11] weekend we're having that weekend and it
[40:15] was supposed to be a Friday night
[40:17] Saturday evening and Sunday morning
[40:18] service but he will be preaching in West
[40:21] counseling for brother for better job he
[40:23] asked over on Thursday so he called me
[40:27] and just asked to to get a rest and
[40:31] preach for us on Saturday night Sunday
[40:34] morning and Sunday evening since the
[40:38] entire Thanksgiving week we want to just
[40:41] create appetite and prepare for whatever
[40:45] meal you will have there will not be
[40:47] service in a week until the weekend so
[40:50] we will have Saturday evening Sunday
[40:55] morning and Sunday service I mean sunny
[40:57] evening service praise the Lord amen and
[41:02] this is the first Sunday of November and
[41:08] we want to wish you a blessed month as
[41:11] we you wanting down to the end of the
[41:13] year and I announced Wednesday night
[41:17] yeah we're gonna have a little prayer
[41:20] meeting out because there were just a
[41:21] lot of things that were on my mind and
[41:23] that's what I want to approach I want to
[41:25] approach the service this morning in in
[41:28] a way of you know I just doing a review
[41:34] taking an inventory of ourself and you
[41:37] know and as we as we just look at all of
[41:41] the things that the Lord has been doing
[41:43] for us and what he's doing and
[41:45] everything that His grace has been
[41:47] taking us true praise the Lord
[41:49] so that's what we want to do and like
[41:54] I've always said to to to the assemblée
[41:57] year especially when it comes to too
[42:01] convenient
[42:03] it's only it's our communion sunday like
[42:08] we normally do but communion is now only
[42:11] for Sunday in the scripture you know
[42:14] they went from house to house breaking
[42:16] bread but there is there are just some
[42:18] elements that are very important and
[42:20] those elements is there you go back to
[42:24] the book of Exodus and even poor brother
[42:26] how beautifully in the end in in the New
[42:31] Testament he says wait one for another I
[42:37] mean so it is it's a it's a family thing
[42:44] you know so it's net it's not a thing
[42:50] word because if if we don't take time
[42:54] it's very easy to create classes in
[42:57] church you know a special class of
[43:00] people in all of that that is that is
[43:02] now what we we are all for you it's a
[43:05] family thing is something that we we
[43:09] pray for everybody we encourage
[43:11] everybody and then when we having things
[43:13] going on and different folks around you
[43:17] know we we want to keep those things
[43:19] dear to our heart
[43:20] praise the law and you know so we will
[43:25] trust the law this morning and we might
[43:28] come back for the for a prayer service
[43:31] this evening and just just to see how
[43:37] the Lord will be able to lead us but
[43:41] they're just some of those few things on
[43:44] my mind and we have you know we have
[43:46] done different things around the
[43:48] assembly we have used the communion to
[43:51] stand for for some situation in church
[43:54] and stands for different ones as we had
[43:56] in that way as we identified ourselves
[43:59] to that portion of the word so let's
[44:03] just you know what kind of a trust the
[44:06] Lord like I said we can be in very very
[44:09] busy and I need your prayers and just
[44:13] pray that Allah would give a string we
[44:15] want to greet brother Joseph ma shooter
[44:20] that's sister cousin husband he came in
[44:25] and praise the Lord so we have in one
[44:38] more down and many more to go

[50:37] about demonology I never said there was
[50:40] somebody I know that I can bring their
[50:41] subject better for us and if I can get

[50:46] beautiful you know brother but Moses is
[50:51] a man that that I respect and he has he
[51:03] has there with the subject of demonology
[51:06] now only geologically but he has been in
[51:11] an area where in his walk with the Lord
[51:15] and also in some of the areas that he

[51:41] these days we can have our brother to
[51:44] share with us some of those things Luke
[51:46] chapter 10 Luke chapter 10 but what I
[51:50] want to do this morning is the other I
[51:53] want to live with you and you remember a
[51:59] couple of weeks ago we spoke on the
[52:02] message called the bounding power amen
[52:06] the power that God has given to us as
[52:09] his children
[52:11] to be able to keep out what is not good
[52:14] for the body and to be able to keep in
[52:17] what is good for the body
[52:20] amen I want to I wanted I want to see if
[52:24] the Lord will help us to be able to
[52:26] travel down that a little bit see Luke
[52:29] chapter 10 the scripture says and we do
[52:32] read after these things the Lord
[52:35] appointed all those 70 also and send
[52:40] them two by two before his face into
[52:44] every city in place whether he himself
[52:50] who come amen
[52:57] therefore say heed unto them the harvest
[53:00] truly is great but the laborers are few
[53:05] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[53:08] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[53:11] into his harvest praise the Lord
[53:15] let's drop down a little bit to verse 17
[53:25] and the 70 returned again with joy
[53:30] saying Lord even the Devils are subject
[53:34] unto us through thy name Amen
[53:40] can we just say they're together Lord
[53:44] even the devil and subject unto us
[53:46] through their name let's see their
[53:49] together Lord even the Devils are
[53:52] subject unto us through thy name and he
[53:59] said unto them I beheld Satan as
[54:01] lightning falling from heaven behold I
[54:06] give unto you power to tread on serpents
[54:10] and scorpions and over all the power of
[54:14] the enemy and nothing shall be Shaba
[54:18] enemies hurts you now we're standing in
[54:24] this rejoice net don't rejoice in power
[54:29] amen
[54:30] in this resource net that the spirits
[54:35] are subject unto you but rather rejoice
[54:39] because your names are written in heaven
[54:45] can them make you rejoice hearing their
[54:49] does that make you feel good this
[54:50] morning amen then like your face you

[55:26] that side let's pray together and I knew
[55:32] I had this prayer requests of mine had
[55:34] brazuca a little son to meeting
[55:38] fell from the stairs I think that was
[55:41] Friday evening anyhow to rush him to the
[55:46] hospital I think he might fracture his
[55:50] back and his neck or in cash and took
[55:56] him to the hospital and he called him
[56:01] cause some brothers and thinking brother
[56:04] farmer pray for them there at the
[56:06] hospital and the law came on the scene
[56:11] and they were able to leave the hospital
[56:16] that night so I think to me tis is
[56:19] recovering and go read you a healing
[56:22] process so we just want to remember them
[56:25] as well
[56:26] Heavenly Father in the name of the Lord
[56:28] Jesus Christ we prayed O God thanking
[56:32] you this morning far the law that we can
[56:35] stand as your children and rejoice
[56:38] because you know our names
[56:41] father we can stand Lord God not just
[56:45] with a mental conception but we can feed
[56:48] it in our lives we believe it because we
[56:51] can see it Oh God
[56:53] you know our down setting you know our
[56:57] uprising of God Father we have come to
[57:00] believe for Lord God that that that
[57:03] there is nothing of our life that is
[57:05] hidden from you and we are so grateful
[57:08] father that we can come to such a
[57:11] realization so Lord this morning we want
[57:14] to commit ourselves in your hands Lord
[57:17] and ask that God you would come and just
[57:20] meet us at the very point of our needs
[57:23] come and give us grace Oh God coming
[57:25] help us this morning oh dear Lord we
[57:28] will love you we appreciate you
[57:30] Lord just like we sank Oh God on to you
[57:34] be the glory for the great things that
[57:36] you are doing father
[57:37] Oh God and we just ask the Lord you
[57:40] would take complete control as we take
[57:43] every spirit under your control for your
[57:46] glory for the few time that we will
[57:48] spend around your word come out of the
[57:50] pages law
[57:51] and meet us at a very point for our
[57:53] knees in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[57:57] Allah bless you you may have your seat
[58:00] amen
[58:01] I would take my time this morning and I
[58:07] take much of your time in a way that the
[58:10] Holy Spirit will lead the service then
[58:12] we will see what will trust the law for
[58:15] later but as I was thinking on this I
[58:18] was I was I was thinking in my mind how
[58:20] I tied to what I want to talk about
[58:23] because I don't want you see many of the
[58:25] times when you start talking around the
[58:28] subject of demonology it's so easy for
[58:33] people to sometimes for us to bring our
[58:37] personalities into it and think maybe
[58:40] the preacher is calling you you know the
[58:43] demon possessed or or maybe you have a
[58:46] demon or something like that but the
[58:49] truth about it there is that there are
[58:51] some things that we have to we have to
[58:54] realize and what the grace of God is
[58:58] trying to bring the stone is for us to
[59:00] be able to know the difference between
[59:03] our our flesh praise the Lord and wish
[59:10] of course they are flesh we have to
[59:13] crucify the flesh that's what the
[59:15] scripture taught us to do amen and also
[59:19] to be able to know when we are
[59:20] influenced influenced being influenced
[59:23] by a wrong spirit from from from you
[59:27] know from the time I gave my heart to
[59:29] the law with my own personal struggles
[59:32] and some of them I share with you I have
[59:35] always learned to believe that every
[59:37] wrong influence is from a wrong spirit
[59:41] amen
[59:42] every wrong influence is from a wrong
[59:45] spirit every wrong thought is from a
[59:47] wrong spirit praise the Lord
[59:50] amen now if you look through the
[59:54] scripture you will realize that there is
[59:57] there is there are similarities in the
[59:59] way the word spirit birth that we
[1:00:04] breathe
[1:00:05] and the wind that blows amen actually in
[1:00:10] the Greek there is one word that is used
[1:00:12] to describe the three of them because of
[1:00:16] the similarity in st. John chapter 3
[1:00:18] Jesus talks about the spirit and he says
[1:00:23] it's just like the wind blows amen
[1:00:27] and the thing about it there is that we
[1:00:30] don't see the wing when it blows I don't
[1:00:34] see you know my breath as I breathe
[1:00:39] but how do I know that I'm breathing
[1:00:44] because I'm standing I'm living I'm
[1:00:47] walking how do we know that the wayne is
[1:00:51] blurring because we can see the trees
[1:00:53] shifting the ellipse and sometimes when
[1:00:56] I get robbed we can see the effect of
[1:00:58] the way then we said it's a strongly but
[1:01:00] we don't see we don't see the way I like
[1:01:04] the way the brother said it before he
[1:01:06] says if you can be able to get a balloon
[1:01:13] and you're able to open the balloon to
[1:01:16] the way and pretty soon you will contain
[1:01:18] the Wayne in a shape are we together and
[1:01:27] that is the same way with spirits and
[1:01:34] influence of spirits we don't see them
[1:01:38] but we can know from our actions and the
[1:01:43] actions of people praise the Lord amen
[1:01:51] we can know from our actions and the
[1:01:54] actions of people and what and what we
[1:01:58] want to do to trust the Lord this
[1:02:01] morning if I would take this if I would
[1:02:03] take a title out of this I will say Lord
[1:02:06] even the Devils are subject unto us
[1:02:11] through thy name
[1:02:14] amen we want to take I would want to
[1:02:17] take that this this morning and you know
[1:02:22] I want to take that this morning because
[1:02:25] what I'm hoping and trusting that the
[1:02:27] law will help us to see here is that we
[1:02:32] have been given power by our new birth
[1:02:35] Jesus settings in John chapter one as
[1:02:38] many that are receiving has been given
[1:02:41] power amen and there are power that we
[1:02:45] have been given as sons and daughters of
[1:02:48] God is to be able to keep out the
[1:02:51] influence of the evil one
[1:02:55] praise the Lord there is something in
[1:02:58] the scripture if you if you if you study
[1:03:00] the scripture then look up suit in a
[1:03:02] message we will get there
[1:03:03] you will realize that the Bible require
[1:03:07] us to crucify the flesh which is the own
[1:03:12] nature amen they can be crucified they
[1:03:17] can die and that's what Jesus went to
[1:03:19] the cross to be crucified is because of
[1:03:21] the old man is because of the of the of
[1:03:25] the sin of the past the sin of the
[1:03:26] future the sin of Adam the you know the
[1:03:29] the falling rate so the old man can be
[1:03:32] crucified and but there is one thing
[1:03:34] also in the scripture you will realize
[1:03:36] is that evil spirits or demons whatever
[1:03:42] way we want to call them cannot be
[1:03:45] crucified
[1:03:46] I mean scripture already you look
[1:03:53] through the scripture you will realize
[1:03:54] they are honored to be cast out praise
[1:04:01] the Lord amen they had to be cast out
[1:04:04] and guess what come back
[1:04:11] praise the Lord
[1:04:12] every time you cast an out they come
[1:04:14] back God designed it that way to keep us
[1:04:18] in check
[1:04:25] praise the Lord I know that you know the
[1:04:30] the caramel shake age that we are living
[1:04:32] in you know people have brought a lot of
[1:04:36] lot of things in you know and and they
[1:04:38] will throw fire on spirits and all of
[1:04:41] that we know is the the lake of hell is
[1:04:44] reserved for those things praise the
[1:04:46] Lord and and and and because of that we
[1:04:56] you know the the Church of the Living
[1:04:59] God the bride of Jesus Christ that is
[1:05:02] getting ready for a rapture we are
[1:05:04] coming to such an age and time where we
[1:05:07] are becoming slothful amen we are
[1:05:10] getting lazy amen and and and and
[1:05:14] because of that there a lot of wrong
[1:05:18] influence hanging on our shoulder press
[1:05:25] alone there are a lot of wrong influence
[1:05:28] hanging on our shoulder there are a lot
[1:05:31] of things that we are allowing that is
[1:05:33] robbing us of our iter attain that is
[1:05:38] robbing us of our position as sons and
[1:05:41] daughters of God are we together and
[1:05:52] that's the thing that I want for us to
[1:05:54] look at remember Jesus here in the
[1:05:57] scripture if you look at this and take
[1:05:59] this Luke chapter 10 over 2 sin John
[1:06:02] chapter 6 those were the very same 70
[1:06:06] that Jesus acts that forsook him you
[1:06:08] know after the Mater - you went away
[1:06:10] this were the 70 men that he turned to
[1:06:12] and said will you also go praise the
[1:06:18] Lord
[1:06:18] Judas Iscariot was among these 70
[1:06:28] are we to get him but now what I want
[1:06:32] you to see here is dead jesus said in
[1:06:34] verse 18 and he said our Lord Jesus said
[1:06:40] I beheld amen
[1:06:44] you come into me and rejoicing I beheld
[1:06:47] I saw him falling
[1:06:59] I'll be he'll sit on as a lightning fall
[1:07:02] from heaven praise the Lord
[1:07:06] are we together amen
[1:07:09] and you also look in the scripture there
[1:07:14] are some few things that we want to kind
[1:07:16] of bring here you'll realize that the
[1:07:20] the purpose of the gospel over and over
[1:07:27] in Luke chapter at Wharf 26 he speaks up
[1:07:31] speaks about that and in Matthew 28
[1:07:34] Jesus also you know taught his disciple
[1:07:38] the purpose of the gospel is to cast out
[1:07:41] devils Jesus in sin is in John chapter
[1:07:46] 17 when he prayed he said father keep
[1:07:51] these ones that you have given me amen
[1:07:55] not out of this world but keep them in
[1:07:58] the truth so we live in this world but
[1:08:05] yet we have bound rates we have borders
[1:08:09] they are setting territory
[1:08:12] we cannot venture on we must not go
[1:08:15] there
[1:08:20] praise the Lord and and in all of those
[1:08:29] things you know put us to the place were
[1:08:33] sometimes we you have to know that this
[1:08:41] old devil is the accuser of the Brethren
[1:08:45] amen
[1:08:46] sometimes you will accuse you of what
[1:08:49] you have done you might accuse you of
[1:08:52] what somebody has have done and in any
[1:08:55] way that he can bring an accusation he
[1:08:57] would definitely bring it so we want to
[1:09:01] keep him off our territory praise the
[1:09:04] Lord hallelujah that is the reason why
[1:09:09] we are not in a picnic we are on a
[1:09:12] battlefield
[1:09:13] praise the Lord are we together amen
[1:09:17] so you will see that I'm kind of for
[1:09:22] doing the best I can in myself not to
[1:09:25] not to kind of bring this to accuse
[1:09:29] God's children because just like we said
[1:09:33] what a Wednesday night of last week we
[1:09:35] read in in the scripture of them from
[1:09:37] brother Branham there sit on don't
[1:09:39] hasn't have no part with God's children
[1:09:43] amen for the matter of fact he does not
[1:09:47] have a representation in you he does not
[1:09:54] have a representation in you you are a
[1:09:58] seal of God you are a son and a daughter
[1:10:00] of God and because he does not have a
[1:10:04] representation in you that is the reason
[1:10:07] why he appeals to your flesh this is the
[1:10:12] only guy that he can appease though we
[1:10:18] are the trusting that the law will be
[1:10:19] able to help us this morning and you
[1:10:22] know when and kind of a bring this in a
[1:10:25] way that you know that one that would
[1:10:29] kind of for strengthen us amen
[1:10:41] a few things as as notes here that I
[1:10:46] want to refer to this
[1:10:55] I found this this familiar saying over
[1:11:02] and over a few places were heard Brennan
[1:11:08] said this and I want us to to to just be
[1:11:13] able to look at it close he talks about
[1:11:15] the Queen of Sheba amen
[1:11:20] he says a little woman wave a little
[1:11:27] bunch of men marching alone with her why
[1:11:30] the sons of Ishmael were out there the
[1:11:33] robbers of the desert she was leaning
[1:11:37] with Gordon and she had to think about
[1:11:40] there but if in her heart she was hungry
[1:11:45] to find out whether that gift was real
[1:11:49] or net God made a way for her amen
[1:11:53] and God will make a way for every man or
[1:11:57] woman that was hungry and testing for
[1:12:01] righteousness sake he's a way maker amen
[1:12:06] he will open the door and he will make a
[1:12:08] way praise the Lord Amen last week we
[1:12:13] looked through the scripture we saw men
[1:12:14] that sought God with Auto be a hot one
[1:12:17] that turned all of his heart to the Lord
[1:12:19] and and and and and you know that
[1:12:23] trusted the Lord with all of his heart
[1:12:25] you know it's not only that those men of
[1:12:29] those days but we also have men and
[1:12:32] women God's children in this age that is
[1:12:34] trusting God with all of their heart
[1:12:37] praise the Lord and God would make a way
[1:12:41] don't be scared
[1:12:43] there's something going to happen it
[1:12:45] won't happen
[1:12:47] amen go ahead be determined to press in
[1:12:51] and see the kingdom of God praise the
[1:12:55] Lord amen now most of the time you would
[1:12:59] see that in the scripture the Bible says
[1:13:02] the kingdom of God is a hen now when we
[1:13:05] talk about the kingdom of God is obvious
[1:13:07] that most of the time we are think
[1:13:09] about heaven but when the scripture
[1:13:12] talks about the kiddin of God like when
[1:13:14] John the Baptist came he said repent for
[1:13:17] the kingdom of God is Sahin amen
[1:13:19] actually what they were talking about is
[1:13:21] the power of God and more men to set men
[1:13:24] free from the influence of the devil so
[1:13:30] heavenly begin here before we get there
[1:13:35] heaven begins in our hearts heaven can
[1:13:39] heaven be comes in our line even before
[1:13:43] we get there where bærum says one of
[1:13:45] these there you a final you're not going
[1:13:47] anywhere it's just a dimension amen
[1:13:55] and even Jesus himself when he came he
[1:13:59] says the kingdom of God is a hand it's
[1:14:02] right here you can step into it this
[1:14:07] morning praise the Lord
[1:14:10] every time that God will deliver the man
[1:14:14] from a habit or delivered a woman from a
[1:14:16] habit every time that God will draw a
[1:14:19] wall of his creature closer to them
[1:14:21] every time that God will allow you to
[1:14:24] experience His grace and His mercy that
[1:14:27] is the kingdom of God unto you here

[1:15:20] to happen it won't happen go anyhow be
[1:15:25] determined to press in to see the
[1:15:28] kingdom of God Jesus told Nicodemus
[1:15:30] except you be born again you will not
[1:15:34] see the kingdom of God I mean if you

[1:16:03] a kingdom of peace righteousness joy and
[1:16:06] full of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:08] you better start enjoying that kiddin if
[1:16:11] now you just get a myth in your mind
[1:16:14] that one day you would go to hell you
[1:16:15] better start right here amen praise the
[1:16:19] Lord it's just like David he was king
[1:16:27] but yet he was a fugitive running away
[1:16:31] from Saul and Holly in the mountains but
[1:16:34] you know when David sat with his men and
[1:16:36] the people that were around him they
[1:16:39] always had a kingdom atmosphere even
[1:16:43] though they were running but if they
[1:16:46] camp at night they knew that David was
[1:16:49] their king
[1:16:50] if they had any they had an opportunity
[1:16:53] somebody takes their heart they are
[1:16:55] running around the fire they are having
[1:16:57] a killer moment they know that he's
[1:17:00] coming to power the know that he's
[1:17:02] getting on the throne they are now

[1:21:45] age of information God has also brought
[1:21:48] us the greatest information amen the
[1:21:52] opening of the seals is the greatest

[1:21:59] thanks before the foundation of the
[1:22:01] world jesus told his disciples in in in
[1:22:04] in Matthew chapter 13 that there were
[1:22:07] secrets that were held from the
[1:22:08] foundation of the world
[1:22:10] amen when God started showing Daniel
[1:22:13] bada that the ghent I kid iam he taught
[1:22:16] down your seal those things sealed it up
[1:22:19] for it is keep for the end time amen
[1:22:25] so God has brought us the greatest
[1:22:27] information while we have all these
[1:22:30] church denomination we all save one God
[1:22:34] but there were many Church there are
[1:22:36] many church denomination wine there is
[1:22:39] an information because there was there
[1:22:41] there is there is a devil that has been
[1:22:43] run in parallel amen with the move of
[1:22:46] God amen
[1:22:49] and every time God move here Oh more
[1:22:52] faster and he gets the people confused
[1:22:55] point them to a man point them to a
[1:22:57] system and and and they mess what God is
[1:23:00] doing and they come around our system
[1:23:02] and any Naima by the a denomination
[1:23:06] and God has brought us out of those
[1:23:09] information praise the Lord
[1:23:12] amen and we are grateful for that praise
[1:23:21] the Lord we are grateful for that to
[1:23:24] know that in this age and time God is
[1:23:26] now building another denomination for
[1:23:29] they will all feel they will all crumble
[1:23:32] but God is building a people for a
[1:23:35] rapture amen
[1:23:44] we must be grateful that we have that
[1:23:48] information praise the Lord
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:59] so within this age of information and
[1:24:02] there is that is one of the things in
[1:24:05] this age that there has weakened faith
[1:24:11] can you just think about it think about
[1:24:14] it when Jesus said when the Son of Man
[1:24:16] comes shall he find faith being the god
[1:24:22] of glory that knows the dispensation of
[1:24:25] the ages amen and he knew in this
[1:24:30] dispensation what we would be dealing
[1:24:33] with praise the Lord with lot of the
[1:24:38] informations out there it's hard for
[1:24:41] people to believe because you tell them
[1:24:43] something the first thing to go on
[1:24:44] Google the Google search amen
[1:24:49] you have you have you have a medical
[1:24:55] examination medical reports there you
[1:24:58] have I mean you just have all the
[1:25:00] reporting you get you just think about
[1:25:04] it just like how God has given people
[1:25:08] grace in this age that would take their
[1:25:10] time and face a Bible up and face uh
[1:25:14] just just the other day I was looking
[1:25:16] looking at a memory verse up amen
[1:25:20] because you're you got to keep your mind
[1:25:22] straight I've been trying to keep my
[1:25:23] mind straight and praise the Lord
[1:25:29] so I was looking at different memory
[1:25:31] verse up and I was just seeing what a
[1:25:34] beautiful work that people have taken
[1:25:36] their time to do and that's the same way
[1:25:40] people on the contrary has sat down
[1:25:43] there
[1:25:44] they have been information on everybody
[1:25:47] you just put up you just put a name or
[1:25:55] just put something out there you know it
[1:25:57] gives you ten different or twenty thirty
[1:25:59] different information on that
[1:26:01] information age and where there is a lot
[1:26:10] of information you know what happen
[1:26:11] people whisper have you heard have you
[1:26:15] heard have you heard
[1:26:17] oh that's why we have this devil just
[1:26:20] whispering on our shoulder saying you
[1:26:22] know do you know this and do you know
[1:26:29] that and pretty soon we want to take our
[1:26:33] cell phone and check for a amen
[1:26:39] but what is it all about it's all about
[1:26:42] influence it's all about influence let
[1:26:48] me show you another example even on on
[1:26:53] your search geared on your phone or on
[1:26:56] your computer
[1:26:58] it's built in a way to know how your
[1:27:05] mind runs I mean because of the constant
[1:27:12] thing you search for the moment you go
[1:27:16] to search it fills in the gap for you
[1:27:19] because it knows what is on your mind
[1:27:25] and knows what you feel in your mind
[1:27:27] with so Arella to give to you for you to
[1:27:29] eat and so now you put few words it just
[1:27:38] filled in a gap praise the Lord and
[1:27:43] because there is there is a there is
[1:27:46] some influence behind it
[1:27:50] sometimes it stepped a little more
[1:27:52] Father and give you something yes oh I
[1:27:59] really didn't know this one oh that old
[1:28:04] devil praise the Lord Amen my goodness
[1:28:12] that's the age that we are living in why
[1:28:14] because because there is a struggle for
[1:28:19] influence I mean and you think about it
[1:28:29] the Bible said in the book of Jude when
[1:28:32] Moses their prophet of God died there
[1:28:37] were spirits that were rather lean over
[1:28:39] his body praise the Lord
[1:28:45] amen oh my god
[1:28:56] the Holy Ghost is rustling over your
[1:29:05] enemy
[1:29:08] praise the Lord he's he's he's doing
[1:29:13] everything he's coming true true gives
[1:29:15] his coming true true songs is coming
[1:29:18] true that the simplest way he can
[1:29:23] because he want to get influence over
[1:29:27] your spirit may praise the Lord
[1:29:34] in the devil is rustling fighting over
[1:29:40] your body
[1:29:41] he has all the things out there to ap2
[1:29:45] this body
[1:29:47] praise the Lord the truth there is
[1:29:50] theater as a as a son of God as a
[1:29:55] daughter of God he want to create
[1:29:58] frustration discouragement praise the
[1:30:03] Lord and something that was just
[1:30:05] something that would just put you in a
[1:30:08] life of wondering something that will
[1:30:12] rob you from the kingdom privilege that
[1:30:14] you have you want to put you in that
[1:30:18] condition I'm telling you a lot of
[1:30:24] people sitting in church they Sunday
[1:30:26] morning around the word that are not
[1:30:29] happy amen they are not happy to be
[1:30:34] there the STD praise the Lord
[1:30:39] loving people loving people they love
[1:30:45] God but I mean with all of the other
[1:30:50] influence out there I mean it has robbed
[1:30:54] them of everything but yet they feed
[1:31:01] that's the best place to be
[1:31:05] and I agree with them that is the best
[1:31:09] place to be praise the Lord
[1:31:14] just like when their the the the the
[1:31:17] earth was with our forum and darkness
[1:31:19] was upon the earth oh my god he mean
[1:31:23] that is that is the one of the beautiful
[1:31:29] picture in the Bible
[1:31:30] if God can just help us in that
[1:31:35] revelation of creation can be filled
[1:31:38] down in our heart and that was the first
[1:31:42] coveting that God made with the earth
[1:31:48] even though the earth was in a roll
[1:31:51] condition praise the Lord he identified
[1:31:57] himself with faith and brought and
[1:31:58] eating out of it praise the Lord
[1:32:04] him aim and then the prophet of God
[1:32:07] would come on the scene and tell us in
[1:32:09] question and answer on Genesis that
[1:32:11] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 was a period
[1:32:14] of time different from Genesis chapter 1
[1:32:16] verse 2 because in verse 1 the Bible
[1:32:19] says God created the heaven in the earth
[1:32:23] amen that was a time and verse 2 says
[1:32:28] then the airforce with our form and
[1:32:30] bound and people get confused but then
[1:32:32] what did God created a man he took a
[1:32:39] perfect picture in Genesis chapter 1
[1:32:41] verse 1 and he was ready to bring the
[1:32:43] air back to that perfect picture and
[1:32:45] that's the same thing that he did for
[1:32:48] you and for me praise the Lord
[1:32:51] amen oh my so God is not he's not
[1:32:56] intimidated and you see and then just
[1:32:59] the different things you know that that
[1:33:02] God's children struggle with the
[1:33:04] different influences that are out there
[1:33:06] you know that the devil tried to use to
[1:33:10] rob our life I can I can go into all of
[1:33:13] those things you know habits the people
[1:33:16] struggle with
[1:33:17] you know and but IIIi want you to preach

[1:36:31] praise the Lord in heaven is watching to
[1:36:41] see what would you do you representing
[1:36:43] heaven on earth you know go back in and
[1:36:50] read a little bit Stella when brother
[1:36:53] Branham talks about the maniac the
[1:36:56] manner of gathering he dramatized that
[1:37:02] so nicely you have to remember this
[1:37:06] prophet of God live his life in vision
[1:37:09] and he talks about this man being a nice
[1:37:13] man I'm gonna bring it like to you this
[1:37:16] wing it might have just been that he had
[1:37:22] a bad day amen
[1:37:28] and he went out and and I mean he just
[1:37:31] had a bad day at work I may be trying to
[1:37:35] get a work or maybe his farm never
[1:37:37] turned out well whatever he was doing it
[1:37:41] just there were it was just about that
[1:37:43] there was just so much on his mind
[1:37:47] praise the Lord and then he's thinking
[1:37:50] about a wife and children home that
[1:37:53] would be disappointed and him not being
[1:37:55] a father to provide a men that ever
[1:38:00] comes and he brings all of those things
[1:38:02] to your mind then he's trying to do his
[1:38:07] best praise the Lord
[1:38:10] believing in the God of Abraham and as
[1:38:15] he goes alone as he goes along uh you
[1:38:20] know he see an opportunity maybe to
[1:38:25] strike a deal let me try it and see
[1:38:28] maybe I could be fortunate in this you
[1:38:32] know what that prophet of God said just
[1:38:34] bought the first lie he told sit on step
[1:38:38] in there diamond there being a horizon
[1:38:44] him all through the day making him to
[1:38:47] thing in his mind that he's now he's not
[1:38:50] man enough and and and and nothing is
[1:38:53] working for him he had to do something
[1:38:56] he decide to step out of the coveting of
[1:39:01] Abraham and do something that he was not
[1:39:05] supposed to do praise the Lord
[1:39:16] let me say like this to you every child
[1:39:20] of God that is born of the Spirit of God
[1:39:22] they knows when they are doing wrong I
[1:39:28] mean if the Spirit of God is in you it
[1:39:33] tells you when you are doing wrong now
[1:39:39] where the person comes to be possessed
[1:39:41] it's when the note that they are doing
[1:39:44] wrong amen
[1:39:48] and they want to justify is that spirit
[1:39:53] taking possession you have the right to
[1:39:55] do it and nobody can tell you anything
[1:39:57] different then a spirit or a habit is
[1:40:05] taking residence because it used to
[1:40:11] bother you now it don't bother you
[1:40:12] anymore you can just lied and get by
[1:40:18] with faith in now and you know while you
[1:40:21] do you don't you don't you don't shiver
[1:40:23] you don't ask yourself what am i doing
[1:40:25] this but if you're asking yourself why
[1:40:28] are you doing this then you are staying
[1:40:29] in the fight and I will tell you you
[1:40:31] fight harder amen
[1:40:42] now remember Jesus told his disciple
[1:40:47] don't rejoice because even the Devils
[1:40:49] are subject unto you rejoice because
[1:40:52] your name is written so even if you
[1:40:56] don't feel that they are subject to you
[1:40:58] rejoice your name is written your name
[1:41:01] is written in the book of the victors it
[1:41:05] in the bulk of the overcomers
[1:41:08] so just by knowing that your name is in
[1:41:11] the book of the overcomers if you can
[1:41:14] take the attitude of rejoicing as an
[1:41:16] overcomer sooner you will start behaving
[1:41:18] as an overcomer and you will start fight
[1:41:21] and overcome up and you will become an
[1:41:23] overcomer praise the Lord
[1:41:34] well your name is in the book of the
[1:41:36] overcomers and you are so saddened and
[1:41:39] you just feel so defeated praise the
[1:41:45] Lord
[1:41:46] just hoping that God would bring you out
[1:41:48] by the skin of your teeth just hoping
[1:41:53] amen
[1:41:55] that another day will not break because
[1:41:58] I can't take this anymore
[1:42:00] you have to wait for the day to break to
[1:42:04] be able to step out and fight praise the
[1:42:10] Lord
[1:42:11] just by knowing that your name is in the
[1:42:13] book of the overcomers it should make
[1:42:16] you happy
[1:42:17] it should encourage you and say I can do
[1:42:21] it
[1:42:21] praise the Lord I can be able to step
[1:42:24] out there praise the Lord I can break
[1:42:27] myself away from this habit no matter
[1:42:29] what it is no matter what it is praise
[1:42:33] the Lord Amen glory be to God hallelujah
[1:42:42] amen you know the devil he like notice
[1:42:47] Amen and that's what I was trying to
[1:42:50] evolve this morning because this service
[1:42:53] is not about him praise the Lord Amen so
[1:42:59] I was just just saying Lord you know you
[1:43:02] come to talking about this thing and
[1:43:04] sometimes you you you are just it's
[1:43:07] almost like let me expose these demos
[1:43:10] let me call them by names and we got
[1:43:12] about talking about all of these things
[1:43:17] and at the end of the service sometime
[1:43:20] the devil is so glorified oh they really
[1:43:25] talk about me today
[1:43:27] you know and then he summer all of those
[1:43:30] demons hey you videogame come here you
[1:43:33] got to create more games you know they
[1:43:35] were talking about you today in the
[1:43:36] service and you different things you
[1:43:38] know what you know the reason why I say
[1:43:40] there I believe there are beautiful
[1:43:42] games especially when when you know
[1:43:46] children are learning how to overcome
[1:43:49] obstacles and different things I believe
[1:43:51] they are beautiful games but there's a
[1:43:53] there's a Christian research that came
[1:43:56] out they attributed were many young
[1:44:00] teens Christian things sometimes that
[1:44:03] goes into you know they get caught up
[1:44:06] into ugly habits is because the same
[1:44:10] party that is that is that is that is
[1:44:16] the same programming part in that is
[1:44:18] that is that created most of the video
[1:44:21] games like horror games and killing
[1:44:23] games in order death is the same
[1:44:25] platform all of these so unclean
[1:44:31] pornography sites are created on it's
[1:44:36] the same one what is happening here is
[1:44:38] that this is the way they create a
[1:44:42] create a relationship it creates a
[1:44:48] closeness it makes it real when it gets
[1:44:56] into all of these fouling games amen
[1:45:00] and because as violent is evil praise
[1:45:08] the Lord
[1:45:08] so that evil spirit is ready to carry
[1:45:11] you to the next level because it's not
[1:45:16] to destroy the images is to destroy you
[1:45:19] I mean is to destroy you is to is to
[1:45:27] affect you those are just images
[1:45:35] are we together I told you I said I was
[1:45:39] not going to praise the devil so let's
[1:45:40] get into what we are talking about this
[1:45:42] morning a man let's let's look at
[1:45:44] something here also Brad Brown said this
[1:45:46] then Jesus came he said just remember
[1:45:48] because Jesus comes every devil in hell
[1:45:54] we try to keep you away from him praise
[1:46:02] the Lord
[1:46:03] now take it like this Jesus through the
[1:46:05] new birth has come in your life
[1:46:10] he has make you conscious that you are a
[1:46:14] son of God and you a daughter of God and
[1:46:16] you can see God's grace and mercy upon
[1:46:19] your life because Jesus comes every
[1:46:24] devil we're trying to keep you and
[1:46:27] that's what he does you see demons add
[1:46:31] to matters amen they are there to meet
[1:46:37] you that's what demons are and one of
[1:46:43] the purpose is to keep you from getting
[1:46:47] to Christ whatever he can do - he does
[1:46:53] not have a problem if he can keep you in
[1:46:54] the church amen he don't have a problem
[1:46:59] if he can keep you around the message
[1:47:01] his problem is that as long as he can
[1:47:05] keep you from Christ as long as he can
[1:47:10] keep you from the truth revelation of
[1:47:16] who you are
[1:47:20] praise the Lord
[1:47:25] now with God dealing with your life and
[1:47:27] the different things that happen and you
[1:47:29] says oh my god thank God for His grace
[1:47:31] thank God and I mean you see God dealing
[1:47:35] with your heart a truth experience
[1:47:37] coming in your heart and you realize
[1:47:39] that this is the grace of God for me all
[1:47:41] law help me in everything he realized
[1:47:44] that you have had a bird something has
[1:47:46] happened to you he realized that he
[1:47:51] could not keep you from there so what he
[1:47:54] tried to do next he tried to keep you
[1:47:58] from being effective in your
[1:48:03] relationship with God
[1:48:04] if your relationship can just be a
[1:48:07] shadow true church member ship he tried
[1:48:11] to keep you from being effective he
[1:48:14] tried to keep you from taking your
[1:48:16] position as a son of God as a daughter
[1:48:19] of God taking the promises of God as
[1:48:21] your own praise the Lord
[1:48:31] taking the promises of God as your own
[1:48:36] when you read God's promise in this word
[1:48:38] you take it as your own just remember
[1:48:48] Jesus because Jesus come every devil in
[1:48:50] hell we try to keep you away from him
[1:48:55] amen that's right
[1:48:58] you might hear the message but the devil
[1:49:00] will sit right on your shoulder and says
[1:49:04] don't you listen don't you listen don't
[1:49:09] you listen amen he will stay right on
[1:49:14] your shoulder and try to throw
[1:49:17] everything at you so you cannot be able
[1:49:21] to focus

[1:49:46] those are some other things that you
[1:49:48] have to fight praise the Lord
[1:49:52] amen sometimes you are alone in and you
[1:49:57] are just dating and you're thinking
[1:50:00] about God's goodness and mercy and and
[1:50:02] it just come on your heart to praise and
[1:50:04] and and and and and to just pray and
[1:50:07] write in that very same time toss just
[1:50:11] float on your mind I mean you think
[1:50:15] about yesterday you think about today
[1:50:17] you think about tomorrow that I'm not
[1:50:19] even come and then you think about this
[1:50:23] person you think about that person it's
[1:50:25] just it's just so hard to keep your mind
[1:50:27] why is that praise the Lord and
[1:50:35] sometimes it gets so frustrating it gets
[1:50:37] so discouraging though I've been there a
[1:50:39] lot of the time I was even there last
[1:50:42] night
[1:50:46] praise the Lord
[1:50:53] sometimes I get to those places my wife
[1:50:55] is so sorry for me
[1:50:56] I mean I was just I was just fighting
[1:51:00] the true last night and I was lying
[1:51:02] right on my steady table I don't know
[1:51:04] she taught I pass out or what you mean
[1:51:12] she came calling me trying to find out
[1:51:14] what was happening to me I say oh my
[1:51:17] goodness lord help me I'm trying to get
[1:51:20] true here okay
[1:51:21] I'm praying nothing is happening to me
[1:51:25] but that's that's what it is that's what
[1:51:31] it is we all go through there
[1:51:38] try to do it just try to focus on Christ
[1:51:44] some of the unnecessary thing I mean
[1:51:49] that's when even the devil want to do
[1:51:52] you favor he tried to remind you the
[1:51:53] thing you forgot and you say oh I
[1:51:58] remember that's how you try to do your
[1:52:02] favor do you know what that thing you
[1:52:06] were looking for you put it in the
[1:52:07] closet
[1:52:12] then he try to do your favor but that's
[1:52:17] the killing of God we must fight amen
[1:52:22] he come and sit on our shoulder you know
[1:52:26] that's what I was thinking about last
[1:52:28] night you know trying to trying to just
[1:52:31] just bring this thing out real that is
[1:52:35] not juris it's not just a slogan it's a
[1:52:38] reality and with this with it
[1:52:48] praise the Lord and they're bound in
[1:52:54] power sometimes he comes you know if he
[1:52:58] if you can't talks about you then he
[1:52:59] starts to talks about somebody else you
[1:53:04] know praise the Lord and all of these
[1:53:07] different things that we deal with and
[1:53:11] and and and that's those are the things
[1:53:14] that we must keep out because the
[1:53:19] purpose of those things is to torment
[1:53:22] you
[1:53:24] amen is to tomat Uist
[1:53:28] it's to trouble you praise the Lord but
[1:53:34] we still believe in a God that can
[1:53:35] deliver
[1:53:36] Amen or believe in a God that can
[1:53:41] deliver I can go on and on and there are
[1:53:46] some of the few things that I could
[1:53:48] share with you this morning but just
[1:53:50] like I said I'd like us to just take an
[1:53:57] inventory of ourselves this morning
[1:54:08] amen and look at some of the few things
[1:54:16] that you've been dealing with in your
[1:54:21] walk
[1:54:28] like I said before we are fighting the
[1:54:31] same enemy it's just that you might be
[1:54:34] on the east gate and I'm on the West
[1:54:36] Gate amen
[1:54:38] maybe you're on the love side and I'm on
[1:54:41] the south but we all fighting the same
[1:54:44] old devil praise the Lord and it's our
[1:54:48] duty to keep him off of our territory
[1:54:52] praise the Lord we have to tell him you
[1:54:56] can come across the bloodline sittin
[1:54:58] there was a line that is draw you can't
[1:55:01] come across the line keep him on the
[1:55:04] other side that's the Christian life the
[1:55:10] Christian life is to keep the devil out
[1:55:14] whatever you have to do to keep him out
[1:55:18] keeping out
[1:55:25] let's bow our heads and how together
[1:55:27] this morning
[1:55:43] remember in Seema chapter one musicians
[1:55:47] you can come in see mark chapter 1 the
[1:55:51] Bible talks to him at chapter 1 verse 23
[1:55:53] Jesus went into the synagogue and the
[1:55:57] scripture speaks about a man that was
[1:56:00] possessed with an evil spirit praise the
[1:56:05] Lord and because the church has failed
[1:56:12] many times when we have people that come
[1:56:17] in with you know funny you know coming
[1:56:23] with familiar spirits or you know
[1:56:27] different things we so easily freaked
[1:56:30] out pretty soon we want to get the
[1:56:34] person out of church because we don't
[1:56:36] want to be disrupted but you realize
[1:56:40] that Jesus never pulled the man out of
[1:56:42] the church Jesus pulled the spirit out
[1:56:45] of the man and when he did that you know
[1:56:51] what the scripture says the Pharisees
[1:56:54] the preachers of those days they said
[1:56:56] what a new doctrine what a new doctrine
[1:57:03] that even evil spirit obeyed his voice
[1:57:27] now what I'm doing this morning or this
[1:57:31] afternoon like I said as we labor
[1:57:34] together it's not a make every one of us
[1:57:39] seen us where we have to come to repent
[1:57:42] and be baptized this morning if you want
[1:57:44] to be definitely we can baptize you this
[1:57:46] morning and but our sons and daughters
[1:57:52] of God I want us to just get to the
[1:57:58] place of being earnest with ourselves
[1:58:01] this morning
[1:58:06] and your seed some of the wrong
[1:58:10] influence that has been around our
[1:58:12] territory we fight against it by yet it
[1:58:23] comes back because what the devil want
[1:58:28] to do is that he want to make that thing
[1:58:30] for you to believe that is your nature
[1:58:33] he want to accept you want you to accept
[1:58:36] it in your life and as a son of God as a
