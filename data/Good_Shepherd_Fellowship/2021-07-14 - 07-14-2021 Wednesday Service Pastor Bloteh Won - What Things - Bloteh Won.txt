with praise amen amen and we are very very grateful to be in the house of the lord tonight praise the lord and we will greet you braincard brother wilson and his family and the church the greetings from nepersville illinois they're just outside of chicago there's a small group that gathered there in vera wilson home and we visited with them actually we had to go uh over to springfield my my niece and nephew were doing a memorial for their dad that passed last year uh and then uh because of all of the kovac restriction uh they were not able to give their daddy kind of homegoing they would have loved to give him so they thought that they would do uh a memorial uh this one weekend and they asked that i come in and spend some time with them so that was why we went there but we we have brother wilson in mind so we said well right after that we would go over and visit with brother wilson i've been talking with brother wilson for uh for some years now and but we never met you know uh is this kind of a friendship where you are just you know and and he's a missionary brother in most of the places he travel he gets to meet people that i know you know and uh and then he comes back from the trip he says um well man every it looks like everywhere i go somebody know you there but yeah we never got the opportunity to meet but uh it's very nice brother uh he's uh like i said a missionary brother and he's also a brother that is that is greatly greatly involved in different things and a few of them we share with you tonight uh he built on an app that i've been using for many years uh called the living word broadcast you know he has he has that website and he also has an app and and he was also involved in the the app uh that hosts the message hub okay there is there is another app or software that holds hold the message so he's he's a software builder i mean he's into all sorts of things i don't know what to say about him but uh that the thing did is that he built this act and like he told us uh brother ariel went with me and he's still working on it what he tried to do is that he tries to sync uh uh all link the bible with the message in the sense that you can go right on his app and and if if there is something that brother branham is talking about and there is a scripture to it you can be able to find a direct link to the scripture you know so uh this is a very very wonderful study studying tools i've been using it like i said for for many years and then he's also running a shortwave radio station from his home you know that goes out and he also run that on the on the living world broadcast and then in the same home he's have a monthly newsletter that he sent out you know and of course events and uh mission reports and structured and different things and in the same home he also uh is involved into uh uh uh uh pastoring uh books and and tapes that he takes overseas yeah you know he said his his children and why they were all involved into helping him uh most of the children are all married and and settling down in their own home and then and then in the same home they run they have a little group that gathered there every sunday and to fellowship around the world so he asked that we pray for him you know i mean words cannot be able to fully i'm not doing justice you know by just telling you like this i'm not doing justice as you as you know me i'm i'm i'm a kind of a very i have a casual way of saying things you know some people know how to put emphasis on things but i have a very casual way of saying things but i'm not doing justice by telling you uh you know some of the things that he does but i was greatly impressed you know i was greatly impressed and one of the things that that caught my mind was uh you know the code word uh bert branham said that uh you know one man in the hands of god is god's majority you know yeah one man in the hands of god is god's majority so uh that uh that actually was uh was very very impressive very very impressive and he just came back from from morocco yes the northern part of africa during the covey he got stuck in algeria with another missionary brother and uh he was able to come back because he's he's an american citizen so through the embassy he was here to come back but the other brother got stuck there for for for pretty much uh over four or five months you know yeah and uh yeah and and many other things that he's involving if the law's turret we're having one of these days to come and share some of the things that uh that he does for the lord it is very very very impressive you know very impressive you see the life of a man he's he's he's getting up there in age a man that have sold his entire life to save the lord you know all the forms he use with the little that comes in from mission he pulls his entire life pension into serving the kingdom of god it was it was uh it was uh encouraging you know it was encouraging to to to me and uh yeah so we visited with them and and we had the opportunity to speak uh uh and what i thought i would i would do was to kind of continue with mine taught wednesday night last wednesday we spoke a little bit from revelation chapter one and so while i was there i thought that i would i would speak on what i had on my heart that i would have spoken home yeah and a little bit with what we were talking on the weekend so uh but you know being being a visitor uh sometimes you take things in a very very different way than when you are home so uh we we had a good time there we had a good time i told them i was not preaching i just want to testify you know about the the coming of the lord you know and and all of that but tonight we will turn to sin luke chapter 24. we will keep in that scene in that scene light i was looking at some few things uh but then i had to quickly come when when i when i when i was told that we we just changed the service tonight because of uh some of the technical problems that we had so let's go to sin luke chapter 24 and let's turn to our feet and we will read a portion of the word praise the lord amen and what i did was i started reading dead in luke chapter 24 from verse 13 where it pick up the two men on the road of emmaus from verse 13 and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emails which was from jerusalem about three schools for long and they talked together of all these things which have happened and it came to pass there why they commute together and reason jesus himself drew night and went with them but the eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communication are these that ye have one to another last year walk and outside and the one of them whose name was cleopath answered and said unto him i doubt only a stranger in jerusalem and have not known the things which i come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things praise the lord and he said unto them what things if i should take a little talk tonight i will i will tie to it what things but let's read on he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth now everything that they were talking was what has just happened and they were talking about him and he's asking them what things was he just trying to play a trick was he playing games or was he trying to prank them a little bit or what was jesus doing and he said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in these and words before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers deliver him to be condemned to death and have crucified him we trusted that it had been he we should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the 10 day since these things were done the lord bless you may have your seat as we continue to read here the certain women also of our company made us astonish which were early at the supper car and when the phone net his body they came saying that they have they have also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the supreme court and found it even so as the women have said but him they saw now then he said unto them all fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning of moses and all the prophets he responded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself all of this why he's talking about himself but talking about himself in the third person let us pray heavenly father lord i would just need your help tonight lord god to be able to say something to glorify you and something that will be edifiering to your children tonight dear lord we want to thank you father for watching over us and keeping us since the last time we were in this building father lord you you've been so good to us yes and we just appreciate you father for all of your blessings we love you and we and we just thank you bless your word now and bless the little time before us in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord well the uh there over in nepersville there the illinois we spoke on what manner of communication that you have in one with another but i will not take that as a subject tonight like i said i will take what things i want to look at some of the things that they were talking about praise the lord amen and as we begin to begin to read the scripture and behold two of them went the same day to a village called myers i i think about uh i brought one in his friend i don't oh bless the lord amen amen he was traveling from jordan and he came to new york and went across over me to los angeles okay when he got to los angeles he didn't have a proper visa for some reason and then his boss told him to go back to north carolina and he said no give me a ticket to my brother's house be with me for a few days praise the lord praise the lord amen amen you are welcome god bless you brother good to see you jesus amen amen so uh uh well you've been walking with your brother i don't know what amount of communication you've been having but i think you had a lot to talk about praise the lord amen well so we we would just take a little talk here tonight and and uh if you remember uh last week when we talked about john experience did in in revelation chapter one the position of john uh uh as he as he represents the bride through the ages but what makes the subject important is that the position where he was for christ to call his attention back to the seven church ages that position is the junction we can call it the junction we can call it the bridge or we can call it the blending of time and eternity because john will add a position between revelation chapter 3 in revelation chapter 4. the voice that called john to turn around and look at the the the seven golden candlestick with the one that was in the midst of the seven goal in candlestick now he was in that position and jesus told him all the things that you see right you see that is the reason why the revelation of the seven church ages could not has come in the ephesus church age because john's position was not at the beginning john position was at the end that's the reason why the revelation of of the book of revel of the book of revelation you know the the the mysteries of the book who only have been revealed at the position where john was the junction or the bridge between time and eternity praise the lord amen now uh uh uh one one of the simple principle there which is a scriptural principle we have talked about a year before it is the very first time that a man we asked to see god and that was moses he asked to see god he said i want to see you and then in the book of exodus god told him almighty god told him no man see me and leave praise the lord amen amen the truth there is that we see god all the time when you look at the works of his hands you look at the creation you look at the design in the sky and everything god distributed himself in his attributes yes praise the lord amen but what the the subject here was that god was trying to get moses attention to this place that when when god is in action when god is moving or he's doing something the principle here is that god does it before we see him before we realize it because we we must understand like i've said before god is not in our time space he's out of our time space he's in tanner he does not work by 24 hours he does not work by seven days he don't have a 30-day steady one-day calendar that he worked back he worked out that's the reason why he can tell the end from the beginning he can be able to determine what would come to pass he knew exactly how it will happen because he's out of time he's just looking at time so this great internal one is bringing us to the understanding that you know that's the reason why jesus rebuked this man and he said slaw of heart the way god moved is too fast for our human nature to catch amen i don't care how smart you are how bright your eyes is god can pass you will never see him praise the lord amen just like jesus said just like jesus said and uh uh saint john chapter three he said just like the wind it blurth we feed it amen that's right but it's it's hard to be able to to uh to tell where it's going it it blows you say so well this this is the way in the uh direction that the wind you see the leaves go this way and then they come this way they go this way then they come this way you know it's it's hard to be able to to determine right there but we we feed it and jesus liking the moving of the spirit of god to that experience praise the lord let me say it this way you think about it this way i wrote something down uh uh some time ago you know you you think about these things you write them down and then they come to your mind when you don't know where you put your note but that's okay think about it this way this very same wind that blows okay that we don't know where it comes from and where it goes where it goes we just feed it if you take that wing in the form of an air and you put it into a tire you are sitting in your vehicle on four tires that have air in it and you drive down major highway you go 40 miles an hour you go 60 miles an hour what is carrying that vehicle with all the mechanical parts that it has if he does not have air in his tire a brand new engine will go nowhere praise the lord or you might drag the car on the ring you're going to get a noisy road that maybe the police will stop you because you destroyed the street when you do that but think about it when you when you when you put the air into uh something that you can contain it are we together now so god told moses that that is the concept the concept there is that you know and the people say you know we we just say it carelessly no men see god you know no man can see god and leave that's not the concept the concept of what god told moses is that he's not a god of three dimensions god is beyond three dimensions he's beyond the fourth dimension he's beyond he's beyond all of our dimensions he's intender praise the lord and that's the reason why he deals with us the way he deals with us is dead after he have moved after he have done it his work is finished he's gone and you turn around and say oh wow oh wow oh i asked god for this oh the lord helped me he's been gone are we together so that is the concept that is the concept that he was he was that it's a pattern it's a concept that he was establishing with moses he took moses and put moses into the rock he said stay right i'm going to pass by amen and i and and and i believe that moses had his eyes shining you know he was he was very attentive you know looking all over but god came in past and he only saw the backpack it was after he have already gone that's when you see it it's after he have already done it so that is the very same principle here that jesus was trying to show to the disciples all year fools slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory so in one sense jesus was trying to tell these disciples everything that i have told you everything that i've told you everything that is written in the scripture if they are happening right before your eyes and yet is so slow for you to grab it it's so slow for you to grab it young people that's the reason why when you think that you have understand life and you think you're so smart you get everything calculated down you don't know nothing that's why paul says he that thinketh that he knows knowing that as he ought to know because the things of god are too fast in a way that god does it but this this this sinful body that's been redeemed is so slow to catch up it's so slow to catch up praise the lord it's so slow all of the things that we think we have honest to in the scripture there are words there are dimensions rings of understanding beyond those things that's why the prophet of god will tell you never put a period always put a command put a big command to so you can tell yourself that there is more to come there is more i need to know there is more i need to understand there is more i need to learn praise the lord now so jesus asks cleopas and his friend what manner of communication after he have heard them reasoning he says what are you guys talking about what are you guys talking about now this is this is where this this particular chapter scripture caught my attention there is so much in this question that jesus asked so much what what what where is your emphasis now as i i spoke a little bit on the weekend trying to you know make a picture of this these disciples walk with jesus for three years this man they were convinced like they said they were convinced that this man is the messiah with all that they have seen they were convinced that this is the messiah this is the messenger of the age a man that will raise lazarus from the dead after being there for for four days corruption have already set in his body and he never did it in secret that's right he says show me the place where you laid him and he went there and and the scripture says and the community went with him they follow him and they all stood there they all stood there just travel in your mind bending that evening when jesus said lazarus come forth when jesus said lazarus come forth he was tied in his barrier cloth and he came walking to them it's not a dream it's not a movie walking to them and they all stood there seeing him being unwrapped from the clothes amen now with all of the things that they have saw with their eyes they think they have witnessed forget about the the the the preaching because most of the things that he preached to them really never sunk in amen but all of the things that the witness with the eyes those disciples never believe that jesus could die they never believe it this man i can raise somewhere off from the dead if you just think about it in your mind you will realize that was the reason why they follow him to the judgment hall they stood by because they were they had an expectation that something would happen that he would change the scene they were just believing that he would do something even at the arrest of jesus yes that's right one of the romans saw your ear was cut off and jesus took it no surgery he laid it right back the man got his ears back with is calm the blood stopped bleed he stopped bleeding so they were expecting that this man he can change the same they were just saying their heart these people don't know our lord they don't know our lord now you think about it with all the expectation they had to see him his body coming from the cross lifeless they were disappointed they were disappointed that's what happens when you when you believe in something whatever it is in this life you believe in your parents day you see something that you don't expect you get disappointed in your wife in your church in your pastor whatever it is so they were disappointed now so jesus questioned what think what think shows us if you read a passage there you will see they said that are you are you a stranger that's right concerning jesus of nazareth are you a stranger concerning jesus so you see the answer jesus question by telling him that the thing that they were talking about the thing that was concerning them was the man jesus was the man jesus which is the flesh the body the things that they have seen but if you look in verse 26 jesus said ought not christ to have suffered he did not say oh not jesus to have suffer of not christ because that body was enveloping christ elohim was in that body the great anointed one was in that body and everything that was fulfilled by the scripture was concerning christ it was not concerning jesus but they were stuck with jesus they were disappointed in jesus but he was trying to take them a little bit further out not christ that's the reason why the bible says beginning from moses and all the prophets what was he showing them that christ he was saying it was christ the seed of the woman that bruised the head of the serpent it was christ that was lifted up just like moses lifted up the brazen stepping right from moses right from genesis all the way down he was showing that it was christ it was christ it was christ it was christ it was christ he was not showing them jesus he was showing them christ it was christ in joseph that his own brothers have to sell him almost for 30 pieces of savor it was christ in david a rejected king it was christ in moses it was christ in joshua he was showing it it was christ it was christ it was christ it was christ so i see continuum as they were traveling and he goes from from from from adam praise the lord amen he said then now the prophets told us that god killed a lamb in the east side of eden and wrapped adam and eve the lamb was christ the lamb that ever killed was christ the boat that noah bill was christ do you remember when abraham took his son on top of the mountain that was christ he was trying to take them from the man from the man jesus that they were stuck with praise the lord to show them christ praise the lord it was christ that gave henry white her sons back it was christ that spoke those courage into existence it was christ a huge georgia cutter that's what the attraction on the mountain brother branham says the attraction has left the man he says what is the attraction you see the attraction is no longer the man attraction is his message because the message is the ministry of jesus christ what think what think what thing are we stuck with one thing that is so stuck in our minds that we think that god has let us down what think what is it what what what have you gone through in life amen what have you lost that you think that god has failed you that's the question he asked what think praise the lord what was he doing he was carrying them beyond the camp he was taking them beyond the camp because we get so stuck with the camp we feel comfortable being in the camp but he was taking him beyond the camp awful slow of heart slow of heart with all that god has done for us we are slow of heart we are slow of heart and god designed all that way because he wants us to trust him by faith amen amen he wants us to trust him by faith now by the things we understand but for us to trust him by faith so he make our heart slow and no matter how you shake your hair you stick and grab it then you look back and say oh i see oh i see oh a c is when it has already passed slow of heart what think can anybody stand up tonight and tell me what i think praise the lord even if god do no more miracle praise the lord he has already done enough yes he has already done more than enough praise the lord he has already done more than enough even just to give us the opportunity to be here tonight for us to sit down and talk about these things so what think what is it that is going to happen in your life that you're going to throw this bible away what a game can happen in your life for you to get to the place and say there is no god what can a critic say for you to say that no this message is not true what think what thing can they bring up what thing are you going to deal with whenever we get to that place of discouragement when all our faith is challenged it's because you are stuck somewhere in the flesh somewhere in the flesh you need some pooch you need to be pulled up a little bit whenever we get stuck in the flesh we get discouraged you get stuck in the flesh all that god has ever done for you goes from your mind it's only that one problem that one problem the one problem that is before you that's what is bothering you you don't even consider the fact that you have the breath of life that he gave you the breath of life what think you want to meet me in the office for us to talk about it [Laughter] i can spend the whole night here we can get through it i will take you from moses and through the prophets maybe the law might help us amen are you seeing the picture yes yes sir all they were talking about you know i mean man i can't believe it you you remember you remember on the sea you remember that night when the boat was toasting man he just woke up and said peace be still all of those things were coming to their mind but there was a conflict in their spirit how can a man that spoke to the wind and the will to obey him the man has stood before pilate and said you have no power except what my father gave how can a man like that die they were so calm i mean such a conflict you remember that day when we went to buy bread when we came he was talking with that woman that way was too bad and we're listening to the conversation he told a woman all the things that she had done oh my goodness oh my goodness look let me be very let me be very very honest with you i was more afraid when i was away from him than when i was closer because you can't hide from him whenever i was away i was i was afraid because i thought he was he was seeing everything i was doing and they were talking out of this thing but you see they were they were stuck in the man jesus the same man that was opening the blind eyes and raising the dead it was the same one that the prophet said he will say my god my god what had that forsaken me praise the lord when god has given you the opportunity as a young man to learn to trust him for you to begin to experience miracle in your life for you to be able to experience god for yourself then you are allowing things like cell phone i don't have a cell phone i don't have a jordan shoes i don't have your light is is is this kind of for things you you want to bring god into jordan shoes cell phones is that what you want to bring god into i don't have this dress i don't have this weave cap i don't have this is that all of those things you want to bring god into when you as a young man or a young woman you have the opportunity to experience almighty god you don't need to close your eyes you can lay down on your bed and look at the city and say god i know you are god you are hearing me you don't need to close your eyes and play religion you have the opportunity to experience god firsthand firsthand for yourself to say i was dealing with this and god deliver me and god heal me and god change me you have the opportunity to experience god firsthand jesus was just trying to grab them in their thought process what was on their mind what thing that's why he asked them that question to see how far they were from the reality how far they were from what they thought the new praise lord i pray that this prayer meeting tonight we will go and allow the holy spirit to speak to our hearts and say one thing he says son what thing are you thinking about what are you worrying about well think what thing is casting you down like he told abraham is there anything too high for the lord that's right yes when when you come to that understanding you learn to embrace god in your trials and difficulties because you know that he have all things under control amen nothing takes him by surprise because he knows the end from the beginning he's out of our time he knows exactly how that situation going to end that's the reason why that's the reason why when when we start when we start misbehaving by crying and and just instead of just praising god and and thanking him and saying lord i i know you know how this whole thing is going to end blessed be your holy name amen thank you jesus this is just a prayer meeting tonight musicians you can come let's buy our house to the lord and pray yes let's buy our house in prayer tonight yes church young people i've been feeling in my heart for a while that we are the place where this our little church is just at a junction where god is doing things and and i believe without doubt in my heart if god can get a hold of us the rest of our life it's going to be so wonderful if we can just allow the lord whether it is peer pressure whatever we are dealing with there are some other things we you don't even understand [Music] but i just feel i feel that way that god is about to give us an outpouring of
