let's uh read from verse 8. let's read from verse 8. but what's but what serious it the word is nigh d even in their mouth and in their heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus christ and shall believe in the heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for wave the heart man believeth unto righteousness and wave the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture said whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the jews and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that calleth upon him praise the lord amen for whosoever shall call it upon the name of the lord shall be saved that's one of my favorite scripture i love it whosoever shall call it upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they year without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sin as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things amen let's pray father we have just read a portion of your word oh god lifting your word above all of our needs tonight above all that we have mentioned in prayer oh god because you will hear our prayer through your word you will hear our cry through your word through that bleeding word father so we ask tonight that you will just come in encourage our hearts o lord as we just want to encourage your people tonight we love you and we bless your name in jesus name amen amen the lord bless you praise the lord you may have your seat i'll take uh uh a few other scriptures here and just like i said for this prayer meeting i was you know i was uh just thinking about this today and i thought that it would be good the last time we were supposed to do a little tribute to brother don ferran and uh i was thinking that we were going to put some of his uh pictures up and just and just do that i thought we would have done that you know the weekend of his funeral but yet instead we we we keep our brother in our heart amen and and we we thank the lord for the life that he left and i think uh brother uh scott and sister naomi took a flower on behalf of the church and and we got a tanks carved back from the family so we want to thank brother scott for doing that praise the lord amen so just like i said this uh october 6 and i woke up this morning and then uh uh you know just kind of for reading through some things and then i came across that uh you know and then i just spent my day in it you know just spend my day you know trying to to capture some of the history that is did around the life of uh william tyndale praise the lord so i'll re review things from the the the faucets book and uh and just some few things here to be just to be able to encourage us praise the lord so we realize here uh that uh god is never without a witness amen he's never without a witness we one thing we have to realize and come to that realization by revelation that we are made for his pleasure okay and he can do with us whatever it pleases we have to come to that realization that we are made for his pleasure god is going to get a people that the pleasure of the lord will prosper in that's isaiah 53 one man the pleasure of the lord prosper in him because it pleased the law for him to be bruce it pleased the lord for him to die the kind of a death that he died and god's pleasure prospered in him god pleasure will also prosper in his bride and that's the reason why he want to get a people that he can have preeminence in because that is the only way his pleasure will prosper in our life and prosper in this bride until we come to that place of total surrounding amen total obedience praise the lord amen so we realize as with that with the building pieces of the of the history that i was i was able to follow and read today on the life of of william tyndale and uh [Music] uh we realized it was it was right in the time just like i said you know uh uh the holy spirit was moving on the earth you know because uh the church was uh uh slowly coming out of is is dark session where it has been ruled and been bound you know by a roman castle spirit and and so god was moving and in different ways he was dealing you know with the hearts of his people praise the lord brother branham says something in the church age book i want to read this he said let me drop something here that will both amaze and help you something that we amaze and help you he said there is hardly a student which means somebody that's studying the word that does not believe the new testament was originally in the greek language praise the lord amen the new testament was because that that was the that was the language of the time amen praise the lord so the the new testament was originally written in the greek language he says all our great bible students have said that god gave the word three great nations with three great contribution for the sake of the gospel praise the lord even when they never knew that they were giving the contribution god still used them for the contribution praise the lord he says god gave the greek who gave a universal language amen he gave us the jews who gave us a true religion praise the lord we also have to have to remember and you know we learn you know brother branham said god has to he he he kept the bloodline amen that's the reason why the jews were they were having all of these these ordinances and and different things you know when was done a person would be cast out you know killed or whatever because god was preserving that bloodline because through that bloodline will come a true religion that will not just be a covering but a true religion that will affect our life praise the lord i know with some of our smart mind you think about religion as a covering so you struggle with a thought of a true religion but that is a true religion amen and god himself provided that he gave us the jews who gave us a true religion and true knowledge of god through the savior that's why he preserved the bloodline because he was going to travel through that bloodline praise the lord even just like i said the other sunday even when the bloodline was cursed in judah and god said there will not be a sun that will rise up because of the wickedness of thy king god himself made a provision by bringing a virgin amen making a promise that you know a virgin shall conceive praise the lord so he provided the blood cells he provided the egg cells but yet he traveled through the bloodline that he did preserve through all the generation so god gave us three nations that gave us three great contributions of the gospel the greek gave us a universal language he gave us the jews who gave us a true religion and a true knowledge of god through the savior and gave us the romans who gave us a unified empire with laws and a system of highway praise the lord amen just like how he raised a pharaoh for the purpose the romans had their purpose they had a work there was a contribution they had they had law in order they were the one governing the world a superpower at that time and uh and they had great uh uh contribution in con constructing roles and connecting one place to another and god will use that by putting burden on man's heart to go on that road and to be able to carry the gospel he gave us the romans who gave us a unified empire with laws and a system of highway thus we have true religion we have a language to express it to many people and the government and rose to spray it physically praise the lord that's the god we serve his ways are past finding out praise the lord amen so so we we see here that uh uh i mean it's it's it's such a blessing that god makes this provision praise the lord he makes this provision so we will realize that the new testament actually was written in greek but the old testament was written in hebrew praise the lord the the old testament was written in hebrew so as the church age went along you know uh uh i believe there were there were many men that that make different effort you know to be able to put the bible in in a language that they could understand you know i believe some use interpreter while the the the eloquent men spoke greek somebody spoke the native language they did that all through the time this is not the first time that they are doing it but you see as time went on and then uh the the the catholic uh uh uh system took over the church they started to introduce the latin praise the lord amen because they were trying to corrupt the word of god they were trying to keep the truth from the people so now they started introducing this new uh a language uh uh a latin language you know what the you know those that go to their their prison and and as i was studying this there is just a common trend that i that i see here it's almost like what the muslims do you know people you read the quran they teach you to read it in arab in arabic now but the thing about it there is that you are learning the words you are saying you are just reciting but you're not understanding what you are reciting you know you're just going yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but you're not you're not processing it you know to really sit down there now recently there is uh there there was uh uh uh uh a kind of how i called it a revival or an outbreak among uh the amish people in indiana and it was because of the same reason that the amish were using an old german bible and all german bible that's what it used in their services but the young generation don't understand it so that all german bible is only among the elite and even some of the the older people that are there they just know how to recite what is there but they cannot bring they cannot process the thought of what is seen praise the lord and that that is just the same old devil saying uh i turned these stones into breath saying he would give his angel charge over day he's just quoting the word but he cannot process what really it means so you see that's that's how the roman church was able to steal the truth away from the people so latin now became the language of the church praise the lord and now because it was now the language of the church it was now a language that was that was just among certain people and and with that they were able also to take the true translation of the word away from the people and give the people whatever whatever the church want to say are we together and the people were enslaved by that over and over i mean years and years and years and years but let me tell you something the bible says and i believe you believe that amen that man of all that this word of god is of no private interpretation the author of this bible is god himself is almighty god himself praise the lord and because god is the altar of his word there is no way that you can keep the word of god you can never keep the true translation printing or whatever you want to call it you can never keep it because god is the author he has the original copy he has the original title deed to his word praise the lord amen i might walk i might walk on on nails tonight but that's okay praise the lord and uh because you see you see this thing is that uh satan has he has always moved in parallel with the move of god praise the lord whenever god is moving he comes around and bring his trench you know it's it's never the same brother branham said if you stutter him and you know his static that's the way you overcome me all the time praise the lord so at this time god started he started moving around and actually uh uh you know the uh this this was actually now with uh with the church of england you know you think about it the people in england where the queen's language is english but the church is using latin [Music] praise lord amen the people i mean it was it was almost everywhere in germany in the same thing the people speaks german there but the church is preaching to the people in latin praise the lord i mean even even to present day if you ever went to a catholic school and and you you you ever participated in mass you know exactly what i'm talking you know those boys they just lend those things they don't even know what they're saying praise the lord they learn it past their school so they can get into the system they don't they can't even tell they'll just tell you it's enlightening but what really happened at that time and and as as history would tell us is it was it was it was i mean that's that's what was happening it was it was the spirit of god it was the holy ghost moving in that very same time because god at that very same time god has already started dealing with the heart of of luther there in germany praise the lord amen his father sent him to school to become a lawyer because his father had a a little company there in germany and and the workers were always fussing they were always problem you know so he wanted somebody to be a lawyer you know in his company so he sent his son to school to be a lawyer you know and uh luther went down there to school and you know and he was a smart ball learning but he was also going to church and he had this haunting taught in his mind of pleasing god he had this haunting taught because the church remember now the church was not teaching faith the church was teaching that you have to earn your righteousness by your works god is a holy god and you have to step up your game and and and young luther could never come to the place to think that he can he can ever he can ever please god so just like brother branham said in paul a prisoner luther got into a conflict with his calling and his ambition now he was studying to be a lawyer but yara said he got into a conflict god started dealing with his young heart so he decided to to forget about law or being the lawyer and go to become a monk praise the lord and his dad was not happy with him praise the lord because he sent him to school to be a lawyer and and and and and when when he choose that path then he then he started he started reading you know he started reading the the the scripture he started looking in the scripture and right there god started dealing with his heart praise the lord god started dealing with his heart i mean luther he will lock himself up he will i mean if he made a mistake he will whip himself if he think evil thought he'd get in the room he will whip himself because the church taught him that you will have to pay for everything that you do and you have to please god he will lock himself in the room and just whip himself with his doubt and until he he found himself bleeding but yet he was taking his body through that but that there was there was there was there was a desire in his heart he really wanted to know god he can he can get away from it and right through that path that was how god did with him praise the lord when when the revelation of faith when the revelation of approaching god by faith break up to him praise the lord amen when god opened his eyes that there is nothing you can do to please god it's by faith it's by accepting what he has already done praise the lord now you will you will see you will see and understand why luther had this struggle because he was smoking pipe praise the lord so but right around that time right around that time even before uh william tyndale came on the scene there was a wycliffe over in england that first tried to write the bible in english now because the the the the church was controlling the state and it wanted to get the people you think about it now that you are denied to know the god that created you and he allows you to speak french or allow you to speak whatever different whatever language you speak you are denied to know that god in that language the church said it's only this language that you can know god in sure praise the lord so there were men different men that god were dealing with their hearts to to translate the bible even right before willing then they'll travel left england there's a there's a family a woman and you know trying to teach bible school or sunday school kids trying to teach kids and what she did was she translated the lost prayer and the 10 commandments in english and because of that she was burned to death for you to have a verse of bible just a verse in the beginning god created just for you to write that verse it's almost like you are you are reading the word and you're trying to make your note to the church it was blaspheming for you to come up with a revelation that you can understand something more than what the priest is saying to you to them you i mean it was it was a blasphemy and more moreover you are writing scripture you are writing scripture the sacred word of god you are writing it you are you there you try to translate it you are trying to to to make yourself understand you are it was death praise the lord a little boy was called with a bible verse the same thing written in english on a piece of paper so you can just imagine the kind of a condition those people were living honor praise the lord where cliff he you know he had a printing work and he was uh he was you know his work was distraught and he was also murdered he was burned to the stake you know and make sure to kind of destroy all his work but you know you cannot destroy the move of god you can't destroy the move of god there were there were i mean i mean god was still dealing with people's hearts amen god was still dealing with people hearts and it was just in that time that william tyndale came on the scene and he was going to church and he just fed he just had this burden in his heart that why can we have the bible in english that the common people that the common people can be able to read it now his burden was for the common people that was his birthing you have to remember at that time at that time you cannot walk into this church building and take any kind of a seat seats were given by starters how much you were contributing to the church it gives you a place to sit down praise the lord amen so people have special seats the same old special seed spirits still falling people people have special seats praise the lord you can't even touch the bible it was just too holy for you and then you're reading the bible you're putting your own personal note in it writing it the lord so you can see the kind of condition that they were living on earth but he had this burden in his heart and his burden was for the common people so one day he was at a at a friend's house i think he was working or so and uh and and and he heard this these guys having conversation and uh and he says uh and and the gentleman said something like uh you know uh uh uh the word of the pope you know the rather obey the word of the pope than the word of god and that was the thing that stirred i mean he felt so stirred and he said and and and he said no we'll ride obey the word of god praise the lord and right in that conversation he made this statement which we kind of stand out as an outstanding statement for for william tyndale he says as long as i leave until i die he says i'll make sure that the the boy plodding will have access to the bible praise the lord now you can see how much burden he had in his heart how much that god was dealing with his heart he says as long as i live i will make sure that even the plot and boy have access to read the bible his burden was not for the elite his burden was not for the people that can afford his burden was for the common people christ's lord and you see like brother barnum says god always equip his men well intended was equipped he knew seven different language than english he was good in the greek he was good in hebrew he could speak the french he could speak german seven different languages beside the english the english was his eighth language he could speak and he was eloquent in it he could also speak the latin so before god called a man into something he equipped a man praise the lord lord be to god you know that's that's the reason why when young people think that uh you know uh uh uh you know uh god is not going to use the education that you are going to school for i don't know why i'm learning all of this for you know in this day you're just deceiving yourself as a young man and as a young woman serving god and and i mean you have to do your best the bible says whatever is in your hands work with it do do good with it put your best to it so without burning on his heart he started and right at that time two little revival has broken up in germany and luther has already written his bible in germany away from the church bible praise the lord so so all of that and that that also inspired him to get out of the country he got out of the country and he went to work he went to work and started and started printing he started printing and just at that time that was when the the technology of printing just broke up that technology of of printing pages where you can be able to bring 500 carpets just at that time you understand what brother branham says at the opening of the seal he says when the seal opened it was just like a rocket it explode and and then he went in and he explode and it and it went in and explode which means when god moves he blessed different areas he blessed uh uh he would bless science he would bless uh uh you know uh technology i mean he would just he would just give men knowledge to do selling things because he's going to use that very same thing for his people when men think that they are they are you know reaching to the place and signs things they are having their invention god is just opening the door he's going to step right in there praise the lord you know so just in that time but he was betrayed by the frame he was betrayed by the friend and and and and they came on them but he was able to escape with the original money strip and he burned all his first work and he never stopped he went on state printing and as he was printing the english bible was now slipping into england revival started breaking in homes because people now have access to the word of god praise the lord sunday evening you remember we read about the life of jerusha how he established his kingdom by sending out those levites to teach the world in every city praise the lord he had a more prosperous rule than solomon solomon only prospered politically he only prospered politically and that is the reason why solomon married wives from everywhere because as long as he had a daughter of egypt egypt cannot fight him they cannot fight him he's the king he's marrying a daughter from egypt they cannot fight their own daughter so all the nations around here representation so he was peaceful praise the lord amen he was not spiritual like jerusalem was jehoshaphat was establishing the word are we together so you see there i mean the the bibles people started smuggling the bibles into england and and moves started going on oh wow people meeting in secret places the bible was not the first print was not as big as this you see that's where that new testament pocket-sized bible is the inspiration that is behind that new testament pocket-sized bible because it was the new testament he was printing his first print were the new testament it was it was a pocket size because they were hiding it right it was not something that you could hold in public i mean if you are on the on the uh field plotting you know they can just take the bible up and read the lord is my but i should have one put it back praise the lord and that revival started to spread and then there was a setup he was arrested in bergen but another friend that uh uh he thought was showing interest in in in publication or working alongside with him and then he was brought back to england but the day that he will die which is this day october 6. he was tied to the to the tree in the public place they asked him to to renounce his work he refused praise the lord amen and there was one notable prayer that he prayed because they didn't want to they thought they didn't want it to burn him alive so they wanted to strangle him before they burned him publicly he just laid for his head up he said lord open the king of england eyes that was his last prayer and in six months the king of england came into conflict which of course about six eight months he came into conflict and he had to break away from the roman system and became a protestant and then they too started printing bible in english praise the lord and he was not the only one there were many there were many men that gave their life for this gospel praise the lord there were many that tried to you know uh uh help their community try to do different things you know we we we also had that in our in our cycle praise the lord amen when brother branham was traveling around the world to germany and different places you know and and he was preaching people wanted to they wanted the tapes they wanted to translate i mean they wanted i mean i mean some people that believe the message you know just thought that you know i i can make a copy of blessing you know and and you know and and give it out to people praise the lord uh just before we came to you know understand like i told uh one time i was at a voice of god meeting you know and then the brother was saying he says you know they were talking about copyrights lord and his other brother says but i i've always believed that when he said copyright that i had the right to copy i never knew there was a law that stopped me not to copy i just said i just whenever i saw copyright i just thought i had the right to copy you know so all of that but you see god has used different men right now brother barry coffrey and and some other brothers are you know working with most of the brothers that were involved into translation around the world you know they are gathering all the old translation and most of the brothers that were that were involved into translation around the wording and and i mean they have they have you know got themselves back into into printing you know and got themselves back into printing uh uh i think because voice of god has moved on to on onto tablets and different things and and what is more exciting about it i might show you some pictures on sunday that is exciting about it is there that they have even got themselves involved into printing bibles in some of those different languages you know so i mean it's it's just it's just uh you know uh and it's once again is is uh it's reviving the people to look back into the world praise the lord you know it's reviving the house of the people to look back into the world and some of these brothers you know what that they stay right there in their local language brother branham say something they pass the tape they try to say it in the language so the so the older people just can be able to to to you know hear what the prophet is saying because i mean i mean if if we just play the the voice of the prophet you know yeah the holy spirit can come down and but unless the holy spirit come down we would just be listening to a man saying something and we're not hearing what he's saying but i'll leave that for another day praise the lord and then right after there there were many other translations before we finally have our king james translation that we have but the life of uh will intended is greatly remember for the effort to buy the battle of putting the bible in english praise the lord and remember he was not looking for the name he was not looking for the name of a man that put his his burden well that this bible will get in the hands of the common people that it will get in the hands of the common people praise the lord i see many of you coming and you leave your bible over the shelf there you don't know you have as there's an inspiring date of how long your bible can stay up there praise the lord the old chef that we have we have a lot of bibles that we we send out praise the lord but this is just to share with you and encourage you i mean people are choosing their heroes and they try to make holidays for their heroes and this day has come and gone and very few people knew there was a man that was burned to the stake that we can have this bible written in english that you and myself can be able to read it that you and myself can be able to read it when he was arrested and put into prison they refused to give him a light to even give him a book or give him a pen to write but the man that was the jailer the guy just like peter experienced there was just something about him that he taught there's something about this man and the jailer and his and his daughter you know started you know sometimes they will come and sit with him and talk and all of that and why being in prison he led them to the lord he lived his life with a desire in his heart of putting the word of god in the hands of the common people and he died with a prey open the eyes of the king of england and the reason why i choose to use the prayer meeting and share this with you is that the next time you take your bible to read it in english you realize that there was someone that took all of his life he took all of his life it was even burned for us to have this bible musicians you can come tonight i had another quote here let me read that then we go to the lord in prayer brother jeffrey will do the preaching on sunday he is the preacher i'm not a preacher invisible union of the bride brother branham said think your god may watch by the water of the bleeding word the word becomes blood the word bled for you and you are watched in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was blessed for you that you might be watched from the field of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the watching of the water of the world that makes your mind and your heart stay on god and his word praise the lord [Music] the bible says heaven and earth will pass away but god's word will now pass away [Music] god has watched over his word man has been drowned for this word man has been burned for this word man head has been cut off for this world but the word of god is still moving on praise the lord the word of god is still changing lives [Music] that's why brother branham says why should we leave the heaven filled with with reality and take a substitute praise the lord that's the reason why i encourage you church make love with the word of god stay in the word of god read the word meditate on the word because even this message of the hour that has come to us you will never appreciate this message until you are in god's word i heard many people that says well you can never understand the bible without the message maybe that's the way to see it i appreciate them for that but i tell you what i know is that i enjoy the message i appreciate the message because i'm in the pages of god's word [Music] praise the lord

be blessed when you read it [Music] this is the only book that has that promise it didn't say you'll be blessed when you understand it they said just pick me up and read it you will be blessed praise
