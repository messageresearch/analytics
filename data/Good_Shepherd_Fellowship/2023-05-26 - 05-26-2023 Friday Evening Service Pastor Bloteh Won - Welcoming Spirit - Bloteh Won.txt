encourage ourselves in the Lord tonight and then we can find our way home [Music] I want to talk on something a little bit that I entitled to now welcome in spirit so you can see why I'm thinking welcoming voice so uh I was just I was thinking on this uh earlier this week I was actually meditating on the thought and uh if I if I can be able to get back into uh that China and I can tell you what I was thinking on it but let's read uh Matthew chapter 8. now we're going to look at two structured in the in the in the Bible tonight they are dead with uh uh the two times that Jesus actually use the word great faith it was to uh the Roman Centurion and also to the seraphinican woman those were the two times in the scripture that Jesus used the word great faith he says I'm not seeing great fear I'm not seeing such a faith in Israel he said to the woman woman great is that faith uh let's let's read Matthew chapter 15 let's read 15. that is the seraphinican woman Matthew chapter 8 is a Roman Centurion but let's read uh chapter 15. but tonight I'm not I I won't make I won't major on the great faith what I want to Major on tonight is the attitude the that that these sisters have that these ladies have all these character have because uh this one lady and one man so Matthew chapter 15 let's just read a little bit yeah and then we will have you to have your seed praise the Lord Matthew chapter 15 let's read from verse 21 Matthew chapter 15 we'll read from verse 21 then Jesus went hence and departed into the course of tide and see them and behold a woman of Cana came out of the same course and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously this with the Devil but he answered her not a word and his disciple came and and he saw him saying send her away for she cry after us but he answered and said I am now sent but to the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worship him praise the Lord that's that's a powerful verse there's if we can if we can choose a memory verse tonight we can we can we can choose to remember that we can choose that as our memory verse then came she and worship him saying Lord help me praise the Lord then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and and she said true Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the Masters table then Jesus answered and said unto hard o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou will and her daughter was May hold from the very hour let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we humbly come to you tonight we never Channel our mind to preach tonight Lord but like your Prophet said the service the Gathering of your people is not completed without your word so Lord we just want to take a talk to encourage ourselves as our our visitors will be coming in this evening again we pray that father you will grant them a safe travel and we want to trust you for the services tomorrow bring us together and prepare our heart's law we can come on the expectation we can come further supporting the gift of God that we preach to us tomorrow coming with no Reserve Lord father only to hear from you so bless us this evening in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed like I said I want to talk on uh the two times the the the the odd time the first time the Bible mentioned that is in Lu in Matthew chapter 8 this was when the the Centurion went to Jesus and uh George happy birthday and we pray that the Lord will bless you amen and uh uh he went to Jesus and was asking Jesus for one of his seven that was now well if Jesus would come and heal his servant but he actually asked Jesus to just speak the word amen and he said I'm a man of authority I know what it is I tell one goal and he go I tell this one come and he come praise the Lord if thou would just speak the word my servant will be healed Jesus said I have not seen such a faith I have not seen such a faith in Israel and the Bible says by our very same hour he servant was healed praise the Lord just like the Bible also testify here when Jesus said to this woman or woman great is that Faith the Bible says and her daughter was made hold from their very hour praise the Lord now so what I want to talk talk on here tonight if the Lord will be able to help us as he has always been good to us I want us to look at uh something that is that is uh that comes common if you are if you are uh someone that is interested in listening to the prayer line uh during during uh uh the meetings of brother Brandon there is something that was always common and it was this statement that you have a welcoming spirit praise the Lord you see faith okay glory be to God I'm almost scaring myself but that's fine now so you see faith we look at uh when you look at this scripture there are a lot of things that Faith rests on brother Brandon make us to know their faith have fun is resting place on the promised word of God amen a fine is Faith on the on is resting place on the promised word of God but what I want us to realize and and look at tonight like I said it's it's the atmosphere the attitude the attitude that Jesus saw that he identified and what he called great faith praise the Lord now you have to realize that this woman was not she was not rebuking demons she was not saying Lord I believe you can heal my seven uh or my daughter and I rebuke that devil and no she had an attitude she had an attitude I mean we you can you can you can believe God's word you can find the scripture you can line up the courts but if those things are not back up with the right attitude Brad Brown was says the right mental attitude praise the Lord amen if it is not back or wave the right attitude you'll realize that uh uh you'll be will be believing God because many of the time especially in the dead and age that we are living in one of the thing that is killing people in this age is the spirit of entitlement praise the Lord the spirit of entitlement we we find that you know we we say we are we I mean we are children of God you know you find that in the in the Christian way you know I'm a Child of God I'm I'm a daughter of God and you know and and and and that is truth but another thing that also goes with those things is that uh God I wonder how much we appreciate the grace that has brought us to this place where we stand praise the Lord you see when a person has the uh the spirit of entire to man is uh is is difficult for them to to be grateful because they think that it belongs to me I need it now you know I have a right to it and I need it now praise the lord it's difficult now you will realize that uh mercy and Grace We Know Thy Grace the grace of God is God Divine favor that he gave to us that we that we do not deserve amen but Mercy comes a little bit in a reverse what we deserve for our failure God did not give it to us that's Mercy amen his Mercy that is Rich to us every morning it is God looking beyond our thoughts looking beyond our hour our failures looking beyond our weaknesses in meeting our needs and a standing Divine favor the sustaining divine grace to us so that is the thing I want for us to look at tonight the Bible in the book of Saint Luke recorded another story word Simon invited Jesus to his house and when Jesus came to his house we realized that he invited Jesus more to make a mockery out of him and in that way he really did not give Jesus the kind of for welcome that he should he should receive the washing of his feet anointing he moved all he never did none of that he just allowed him to sit there but right in that same house there was another woman that came with a welcoming spirit you see church is a big thing we talk about keeping the atmosphere in church and just like I said on on Sunday when you when you think about the attributes of God you know it is it's a word that that we have been exposed to around the message the attributes of God when you think about the attributes of God you'll realize that God's attribute is not what he has no God's attribute is what he is praise the Lord God don't have love God is love praise the Lord you and I have love because we can lost it whatever you have you can lose it God is his attribute so when we talk about the the the the only present God we talk about this great God this great intent of God you realize that God one time fell every space he filled every space as the great internal spirit but yet God has not lost their position he has not lost that position he still fell every space tonight he has not lost that position because for God to lose it again it's not part of him he stayed the great internal spirit that's why we can believe that we have eternal life because his Spirit has come in US are we together so you will see that by the word of God and and and God has been so gracious to us in this day and age honor this move of God to be able to help us not just by the uses of words but also to be able to expose us to to this reality that the god that we self he's not a god that is that is far off like I said on Sunday he's he's he's more near than the breath that we breathe praise the Lord he's more near he's ever saw me ever so near praise the Lord now so as we as we look into this and you look through the scripture also you will realize I have a few things I'll read to you you look through the scripture you will realize that uh uh most of those people that has uh uh uh been able to to break into this present that is so near that is so real praise the Lord it is the attitude of approach God Is So near and the truth of the matter there is that many times we are so far away from him take for example when God came down and looking for Adam and said Adam Adam where are you it's not that God did not know where he was right but Adam did not know where he was it was Adam that did not know where he was why because he hath left his place he had left the position that God has given him he has fell from the grace of God he did not know his where he was that's why he was hiding himself because this was a man that that was that was that was always waiting on uh uh Fellowship he had access to this great presence when it was time for Fellowship it was time for worship he could step into that presence anytime because it's a presence there is accessible amen it's a presence that is accessible it's a presence that is near is a presence that is real and is the presence that God expects us to live in every day praise the Lord bringing us to the reality that the god that we get on our knees to speak to the one we left our hands so he's not he's not beyond the clouds and one of the things that handle us is because we have not found the attitude of welcoming him we have not found that that welcoming attitude to know that he's there praise the Lord the person that you welcome the one that you welcome is not far off he has to be nine you don't welcome someone that is far off you wait for them to come they are there you realize that they are there and then you welcome him so we share a few quotes with you tonight and you will realize and I see as you look in the in these two scriptures that we mentioned tonight I believe that that was what Jesus identified as great faith the attitude of those people in his presence praise the Lord amen this woman she's trying to get Jesus attention he's paying no attention to her the disciple even one one her to be Cast Away praise the Lord she did not allow the attitude to affect her she kept a constant attitude to be able to get the Lost attention praise the Lord sometimes she used their she she tried to use a scriptural word thou son of David just like we were doing prayer only putting God almighty God you are the ever-present god all of those things are wonderful Jesus said when you pray he says our father Hallowed Be Your Name praises to your name they are it's all wonderful you know identifying God by his his attributes and his ability it's all beautiful but you but we could still do that in our mind is far away we could do that and and you are looking for God in the clouds you are trying to send your mind somewhere to go and find him when he's right here she used the right word thou son of David when when when blind but he must use it it caught his attention even in a crowd of noise he could identify It capture him and this woman trying to you know address him with that I mean we you can be you can get into all the arguments she was not a Jews she was not supposed to say I mean all of those things they are just arguments but the reality there is that she possessed something there was something that she possessed Within that welcoming spirit is within it's not a mental thing it's within praise the Lord yeah you I mean you we we deal with that sometimes you you know you try to put up your best behavior you know just just to be able to accommodate your guests but if it is not within it will show so soon praise the Lord because as soon as things start going out of the order you just want them to leave I can't wait for them to get out of here oh my God you see so it was something that she possessed Within a welcoming spirit praise the Lord the woman that was Jesus filled with her tears she also brought that before the Lord amen she brought that she she make him to feel welcome I tell you church that's when we get the blessing not as in or not in all our emotional exercise is when God feel welcome when he realized that it is not about you and it's not about me if we are not making if God realize that we are not making ourselves the subject of attention praise the Lord he is the subject of attention he's the one that we must be paying attention to he is the one we must be praising he's the one that we must be lifting up it is because of him that we are here praise the Lord and we must be able to show that it's because of him that we are here sometimes it looks like it's all because of us for the sins that we are so caught up in ourselves and we get our mind in insult your face we get so so uh uh uh uh uh uh take their color credit card or whatever it is like I said I have few thoughts here to read I won't keep you long my commission I read this one if I if I remember right I think I spoke on this uh some years back but in a different way and I perceive that when you walk up there's a welcoming spirit and you are suffering too emotion in her body she's dealing with pains or whatever she's dealing with in her body but yes she's keeping her attitude right praise the Lord she's not making her pain the center of attention praise the Lord because sometimes people know how to make their pain the center of attention right because that's that's all they talk about they whine about it hmm oh this thing will kill me if it's okay you should be dead long time praise the Lord that's a welcome spirit and and you are suffering too that's right but standing here are the platform just now as he walk up I fell a welcoming spirit and I said you are a Christian you are a Christian believer now that's the same spirit The Same Spirit they are said through the master to Nathaniel behold an Israelite indeed a believer and Israelite in whom there is no God praise the Lord balbraham says God is not an onlooker the reason why he called us as his children is for him to bless us he comes down to bless us praise the Lord he come down to discern our knees and to minister to the same many times is our attitude praise the Lord it's our attitude glory be to God amen a man can come behind this Pulpit with the most porous gift poor as a gift he can be one of the most poorest preacher just like myself but the attitude of the people wanting to receive from God can put that man in a channel well he can be a blessing to us how much called after all this now the preacher that brings the blessing brother Brian said it's not an evangelist that comes to time that brings the Revival he says it's the people the Evangelist just comes to stirred what is in us what is in our mess you see that time and time and time and for many of the cases that that is mentioned a welcoming spirit is mentioned there is there is I mean the the the the gift just flew deep college today first time you don't you don't know nothing about me and Adam the letter is a Christian because she has a real welcoming spirit and she conscious of some things here at the platform not a man Danger of God is here praise the Lord the Bible says the angels of the Lord are in come about that about those that fear Him the angels of the Lord are here praise the Lord are we conscious of it one of the place where the Bible ever used this statement was in uh Jacob experience there are belter when he lie his hair to to rest and he broke into a vision and he he had a vision or a dream and saw angels ascending and descending he said this is the Gate of Heaven he didn't say Gates it's not Gates it's not it does not have an S it's a gate one gate praise the Lord he says this is the Gate of Heaven amen he says the Lord is here and I never knew it praise the Lord he says the Lord is here and I never knew it and I believe this if the Lord would just help us praise the Lord when bad atmosphere is among the people I mean the presence of God becomes so real that even the ones that are weak ones and the ones that are struggling and the ones that are doubting God can be able to help them have faith in God just few of them that I have to read tonight you believe me do you serve I truly believe for between you and I seems to be a welcoming spirit more I talk to you perhaps the more the Lord Jesus will show us tell us reveal to us praise the Lord I mean that's all the Lord is spread of his people that all he expect of his people and over and over we have been taught how is the atmosphere that brings the result praise the Lord it's the atmosphere that brings the result we are just we are just welcoming his presence we are opening ourselves to the present that is already here amen that's what we must be doing we must be opening ourselves setting our thoughts aside to that presence of the Lord that is already here praise the Lord I mean as as a pastor with with uh We've uh We've a couple of times you you you you can see it you you feel it I think there was there was a couple of Wednesdays I think is that two or three Wednesday night to go uh I mean it was it was just so easy you could just feed it when you come down you feel you feel the people right in their atmosphere is some of the things that makes it a joy to be in the house of the Lord I was glad when he said let us go into the house of the Lord we come with that gladness we come with that relaxed mind it's not like a punishment it's not like oh yeah we're coming to be sit down yet again and spend all of this time here no but they're just there is just that peace it's the place that we want to be we enjoy being there we enjoy being in a service we enjoy being in the presence of the Lord we enjoy the songs that we sing praise the Lord a prayer is said to the Lord we enjoyed the Lord being praised when a man said Lord I bless your name you see it right Beyond it I bless your name Jesus that's not having the form of godliness having the form of godliness we just want everything to be you know everything to just to be I mean he's praying too long he's talking to your father he's talking to the god that you came to wash it they say oh he's praying too long praise the Lord all he said he's singing off Keith I mean we bring all of those attitude and and those things is just it make us we come short of his presence we don't have to welcome his presence his presence is already here he's here it's recreating a welcoming atmosphere acknowledging the presence that we are in being just like Jacob the Lord is in this place and I didn't know it that's why Jacob said it creates such an excitement it creates such an expectation because we know what I mean what what do we expect to receive from the Lord but to be blessed it's not a question of whether we will be blessed or not we know that we will be blessed so we come with that with that expectation we come with that attitude to be blessed to enjoy the presence of the Lord enjoy the specials that is that that have been sunk enjoy the songs that we sing enjoy the music enjoy the word of God and we are glad about it we are excited about it just enjoying the presence of the Lord having a welcoming spirit that's what I believe that Jesus called great faith when people have that attitude they are a people of great faith praise the Lord if the word called them out just like the woman says that the bread I mean the bread that's the children bread it's not for dogs she said that's okay Lord the dogs can also eat the crumbs praise the Lord they are understanding that that uh uh acknowledgment of who who the Lord Jesus was to her she did not allow anything to affect the feelings that she had in her heart she knew that this man have the answer to my daughter's situation so she did not allow anything whether he was ignoring her she did not she did not allow to get into that place of complex she kept that that was what Jesus was identifying as a great faith praise the Lord oh may God gave us a welcoming spirit just how to make the Lord to be pleased to do it in our mess praise the Lord you know in the book of Arts but Ben says how as chapter 5 will be back in the church that's another subject in itself because for a long time I thought they are their uh when I read that I've always thought that at that that as chapter 5 just like how the unmiasing his wife was called out during Peter meeting you know we always look over to that negative part but when I started studying it through the message I realized that he was talking about the gift of the sermon that was already here that the same way how he called anani because you see sometimes that's that is that is the way that our falling mind is we always like we measure on the manner yeah we always look at the negative part of it then then the positive part of it but for a long time I've always thought you know it would be that that gift that would come back to the church and say brother you have just taught a lie today you lie to your wife praise the Lord but the prophet of God said that gift has been here the word of God is sharper than the two-edges world Discerning the intents of our heart every time the word is preached to us we are right back in Acts chapter 5. it's calling out things in our life is also encouraging us it's not only there to condemn it's also there to instruct us how we can better walk with the Lord how we can come please him with the Lord how we can have a a easy access into his presence is by a welcoming spirit praise the Lord we come to Worship the Lord if the deacons you correct me out there or maybe say something to me correct me let me say it that way I mean I Came To Worship the Lord why should I allow that to handle me why should I be true off by that are we together Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this will be the last one I would I would read I just pick this few among many he says for you already are a Christian your spirit is welcoming see if it was an unbelievable it will know it right quick but you got a welcoming spirit praise the Lord a Christian Spirit must be a welcoming spirit and sometimes that's what people feel when they just asks you are you a Christian they just fear something be fair a welcome spirit I knew that praise the Lord I mean that's just how healing and deliverance comes to the body if the people knows how to acknowledge God's presence the thing that make us to be reverence in the house of God it makes us to you know uh not to be cause destruction and all of that is just that that thing is it's not it's not the place where we we we come and and stop pounding Church order into your head right thou welcoming spirit and thou Spirit of reverence will order you right into church order we will not have to preach Church order every every service well we have a church order you know we have a church or the church order says this in that way we have become we're trying to be formal you know that's the church order but a welcoming spirit is a Christian spirit Spirit of reverence is a Christian spirit that is something that we must have all the time whether we are in a message church or we are visiting another church is not because we are outside that we must lose it that consciousness of his presence Even in our home Even in our own time of prayer we don't allow the buzzing of the phone and everything going about to to distract us from that presence is a presence of great faith praise the Lord if we want to experience God moving in our lives let's take an attitude of great faith is that attitude that Jesus identified your attitude is a great faith praise the Lord the Lord bless you tonight the musicians will come and we will
