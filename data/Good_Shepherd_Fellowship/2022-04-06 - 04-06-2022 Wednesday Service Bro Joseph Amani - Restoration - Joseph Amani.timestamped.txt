[3:48] chapter 1 mysterious birth sign covering
[3:51] the years 1909 to 1912.
[3:55] 15 is not too young to have a baby
[3:58] muttered ella branham to herself trying
[4:00] to bolster her courage
[4:01] why i'm just as ready as the pain struck
[4:04] again stronger more commanding than
[4:07] before
[4:08] ella felt her panic rise with a
[4:10] spreading discomfort
[4:11] she held her swollen stomach and groaned
[4:14] not yet please not yet not until charles
[4:18] comes home
[4:20] beads of sweat popped out in her
[4:22] forehead she staggered across the dirt
[4:24] floor to the cabin's only window set in
[4:27] the middle of a crude wooden door
[4:29] the window had no glass only a wooden
[4:32] shutter which ella left open during the
[4:34] day and closed at night
[4:36] now it was open
[4:39] charles she screamed her voice seemed to
[4:41] evaporate into the kentucky back woods
[4:44] with his vast expanse of hills and
[4:46] hollows stretching out from her in every
[4:48] direction
[4:50] knowing her nearest neighbor lived miles
[4:52] away made ella feel desperately alone
[4:54] the pain tightened around her stomach
[4:56] driving her into a panic
[4:59] charles she screamed again charles where
[5:02] are you
[5:03] then her voice sank into a feeble sob
[5:06] please come home
[5:08] i need you
[5:10] charles branham had received his logging
[5:12] pay that morning and had walked into
[5:14] berksville kentucky to buy a new pair of
[5:16] bib overalls in honor of my first child
[5:19] he said
[5:20] but what was keeping him so long
[5:23] had he gotten waylaid by a tavern if so
[5:26] it would not have been the first time in
[5:28] their one-year marriage but surely
[5:30] charles wouldn't do such a thing today
[5:32] he knew their baby was due anytime
[5:36] the contraction subsided leaving her
[5:38] spent ella sagged against the splintery
[5:40] door jam watching the sun settle behind
[5:43] the maples and oaks that had just begun
[5:45] to bud
[5:46] it was april in the year 1909
[5:49] ella shivered as she closed the shutter
[5:53] now the only light in the cabin came
[5:55] from the sunset filtering through the
[5:57] chinks between the roughly squared logs
[6:00] pencil beams of light move slowly across
[6:02] the table a homemade affair built from a
[6:05] sawed-off tree stump with wooden pegs
[6:08] for legs and a bench for a seat
[6:10] the only other piece of furniture in the
[6:12] single 12 foot long room was a primitive
[6:15] bed nailed to one wall
[6:17] ellis staggered to the bed and collapsed
[6:19] on its straw tick pulling the quilt up
[6:21] to her chin the corn chuck pillow
[6:23] crackled under her head with every move
[6:26] as the room darkened to black ella
[6:28] thought about her former home in paris
[6:30] texas which she had so recently wanted
[6:33] to escape
[6:34] last year it had seemed intolerable but
[6:37] now from this position it did not seem
[6:40] so bad
[6:41] she had grown up in texas as ella harvey
[6:44] her father was a hunter trapper and
[6:46] school teacher her mother was a
[6:48] full-blooded cherokee indian
[6:50] ella the oldest of four children had
[6:52] lived a wonderful carefree childhood
[6:54] until three years ago when her mother
[6:56] died from scarlet fever
[6:58] at that time ella was barely 12 years
[7:01] old and her youngest brother was only
[7:03] four the chore of mothering fell heavily
[7:06] into ella's lap
[7:08] a little over a year ago she'd met
[7:09] charles branham at a rodeo charles was
[7:12] short and handsome with curly black hair
[7:15] broad shoulders and enough cowboy skills
[7:17] to defeat almost every bucking bronco
[7:20] that he challenged
[7:21] ella was smitten by his charm
[7:24] charles was 18 and she was 14 but she
[7:26] felt years older
[7:28] at that time marriage had seemed like a
[7:30] good way to avoid the drudgery of caring
[7:33] for her younger siblings
[7:34] now she wondered if she had merely
[7:36] jumped from one hot frying pan into
[7:38] another
[7:39] here she was 15 years old a stranger in
[7:42] the kentucky hills having a baby 40
[7:45] miles from the nearest doctor with not
[7:47] even a friend to call on for help
[7:50] burying her head in her pillow
[7:52] ella wept
[7:54] charles branham returned to the cabin an
[7:56] hour after dark he had been drinking of
[7:58] course but not enough to dull his
[8:00] thinking
[8:01] he inched the door open quietly so that
[8:03] he wouldn't disturb his young wife if
[8:05] she were asleep then he heard her moan
[8:08] charles quickly lit a pine knot and set
[8:11] it on the lid of a fruit jar the pine
[8:13] knot burned with a dim sputtering light
[8:15] that gave off volumes of smoke because
[8:18] the cabin was naturally ventilated the
[8:20] smoke drifted up past the rafters
[8:23] sifting out through the cracks in the
[8:25] clapboard shingles overhead
[8:27] charles ella whispered weakly tonight's
[8:30] the night go fetch your mama
[8:33] charles built a fire then he hurried to
[8:35] his mother's cabin the night was cold
[8:37] and clear and the starlight made it easy
[8:39] to keep on the path
[8:41] an hour later he returned with his
[8:43] mother and two neighbor women
[8:45] grandma branham was a crusty old woman
[8:48] tough as bacon rind but seeing this
[8:50] little 15 year old girl in labor
[8:52] softened her like hot grease
[8:54] softens boot leather not that grandma
[8:57] branham ever used boots herself she'd
[8:59] never owned a pair of shoes in her life
[9:02] now she took charge of the situation
[9:04] having had 17 children of her own she
[9:07] was well prepared to act as midwife for
[9:09] her new daughter-in-law she insisted
[9:11] that charles wait outside he did not
[9:14] argue
[9:16] taking a blanket he crawled under the
[9:18] lean-to tacked onto one end of the cabin
[9:20] making his bed on the wood chips and
[9:22] bark
[9:23] pulling a flask of whiskey out of his
[9:25] pocket charles polished it off to calm
[9:28] his nerves before long he fell sound
[9:30] asleep as dawn approached the commotion
[9:33] inside the cabin grew more intense
[9:36] charles roused
[9:37] the eastern horizon was turning lighter
[9:40] with the approach of dawn but the sun
[9:42] had not yet risen he cursed himself for
[9:44] having dozed and then started to worry
[9:46] because his baby had not yet been born
[9:49] was something wrong
[9:51] maybe he should go inside and check
[9:53] before he could make up his mind he
[9:55] heard the high pitched squall of a
[9:56] newborn the cabin door flew open and one
[10:00] of the neighbor women called charles
[10:02] branham it's a boy
[10:04] sheepishly charles shuffled inside and
[10:06] closed the door the room smelled of
[10:09] smoke from a greased candle on the table
[10:11] grandma branham finished washing the
[10:13] infant weighed him at five pounds then
[10:16] gently laid him in his mother's arms
[10:19] charles stood near the bed with his
[10:20] hands tucked into the bib of his new
[10:22] overalls nervously watching this
[10:24] wiggling grunting little creature that
[10:26] was his son ella said
[10:28] charles he's got your blue eyes charles
[10:32] studied the small eyes but in the dim
[10:34] light he couldn't tell their color
[10:37] we'll call his first name william he
[10:39] said and his middle name will be marion
[10:42] ella tested the name with her tongue
[10:44] william miriam branham it sounded
[10:47] distinguished enough and he can go by
[10:49] the name of billy
[10:51] charles i think billy's going to have
[10:53] your curly hair too open the shutter so
[10:56] i can see him better it was shortly
[10:58] after five o'clock tuesday morning april
[11:00] 6 1909
[11:02] daylight filtered in through the chinks
[11:04] even though the sun had not yet topped
[11:06] the horizon
[11:08] charles opened the shutter then drew
[11:09] back startled
[11:11] something had darted through the open
[11:13] window
[11:14] a light like a star about a foot in
[11:17] diameter
[11:18] ellis screamed and cradled her son
[11:20] tightly to her bosom
[11:22] the others bewildered step back against
[11:24] the wall the strange light circled the
[11:27] room several times then stopped over the
[11:29] bed hovering above the new mother and
[11:31] the child
[11:33] glowing yellowish green
[11:35] pulsating with a life of its own
[11:37] for less than a minute it held that
[11:39] position
[11:40] not long yet long enough for everyone in
[11:43] the cabin to be sure they had really
[11:45] seen it then as quickly as it had come
[11:48] in the fireball left whirling up past
[11:51] the rafters and out through the roof
[11:53] charles stared up at the clapboard
[11:55] shingles with wide unblinking eyes
[11:59] suddenly a flurry of wings turned his
[12:01] attention towards the door where a dub
[12:03] had landed on the sill of the open
[12:04] window
[12:06] the snow white dove eye the room with
[12:08] curiosity
[12:09] almost as if looking for something when
[12:12] it spotted the newborn baby it cocked
[12:14] its head and cooed before it flew away
[12:17] charles gazed after the bird for a
[12:19] moment then rolled his eyes back up
[12:21] towards the roof
[12:23] one of the neighbor women muttered
[12:25] well i never
[12:27] the other mused i wonder what kind of
[12:29] youngin this boy will be
[12:31] billy branham was only 15 minutes old
[12:34] born yonder on the hill with a light
[12:36] over him some passed it off as sunlight
[12:39] reflecting from a mirror ella and
[12:41] charles knew better since there were no
[12:43] mirrors in their cabin
[12:45] besides the sun had not yet come up
[12:47] they were puzzled was there some
[12:50] spiritual meaning in the light charles
[12:52] wanted to forget it but ella wouldn't
[12:54] let him
[12:55] she insisted that something must be done
[12:58] and finally decided that their baby
[12:59] should be taken to a church and
[13:01] dedicated to god
[13:03] at first charles argued against this
[13:05] idea but finally he consented although
[13:07] the concession raked against the grain
[13:09] of his character
[13:11] now the question came up where should
[13:13] they take him
[13:14] the ancestry of charles branham was
[13:16] strictly irish catholic on ella's side
[13:19] the harveys were irish catholic too
[13:21] except for ella's mother who belonged to
[13:23] the cherokee nation however both charles
[13:26] and ella had drifted completely away
[13:28] from their catholic foundation and
[13:30] neither of them had any formal religious
[13:32] convictions they agreed that for their
[13:34] purpose the best church was the nearest
[13:37] church so when billy branham was two
[13:39] weeks old charles and ella bundled him
[13:41] up and took him down to the opossum
[13:43] kingdom baptist church where a small
[13:45] congregation met each sunday in a rustic
[13:48] log building with a dirt floor and pews
[13:51] made from boards lying across upturned
[13:53] blocks of wood
[13:54] the opossum kingdom baptist church had
[13:56] no regular pastor on most sundays the
[13:59] congregation sang songs and read from
[14:01] the bible
[14:02] but every two months a circuit preacher
[14:04] came through and delivered a sermon the
[14:07] old preacher was there today he offered
[14:09] prayer over little william mariam
[14:11] branham asking god to someday use this
[14:14] boy in his service it was the last time
[14:17] billy branham would enter a church
[14:18] building for 23 years
[14:21] locking often forced charles to be away
[14:24] from his wife and son during the week
[14:26] that october in 1909 a blizzard stranded
[14:29] him in a lumber camp far from home
[14:32] ella four months pregnant with their
[14:33] second child worried as her supplies
[14:35] dwindled
[14:37] when her firewood ran out she wrapped
[14:39] her feet in burlap bags and struggled
[14:41] through the waist high drifts and biting
[14:43] wind
[14:44] fighting her way into the woods to chop
[14:46] down saplings and dead branches dragging
[14:49] them back into the cabin in a desperate
[14:51] attempt to keep her fire going but
[14:53] winter food gave out she despaired
[14:56] fire cooled to ashes ella was too weak
[14:59] to make another trip outside for wood
[15:01] gathering every scrap of clothing in the
[15:04] cabin she wrapped herself and her son as
[15:06] best she could crawled into bed and
[15:08] pulled the quilt over them
[15:11] outside the wind howled unceasingly the
[15:14] room chilled until her water bucket
[15:16] froze
[15:17] ella stared up into the rafters and
[15:19] considered again that strange light at
[15:21] her son's birth
[15:22] she had thought of it often over the
[15:24] past six months sometimes she believed
[15:27] it was a sign that billy was destined
[15:28] for greatness
[15:30] now it seemed meaningless since death
[15:32] for both of them could not be far away
[15:35] her nearest neighbor was an old man who
[15:37] lived across the valley when the storm
[15:39] blew out this neighbor stepped outside
[15:42] to do some chores
[15:44] he could just see the top of the branham
[15:46] cabin and he noticed there was no smoke
[15:48] rising from the chimney at the time he
[15:50] didn't give it much thought but after
[15:52] several days he grew concerned he knew
[15:54] smoke had been coming from the cabin
[15:56] before the storm and no one could have
[15:58] left the cabin during the storm
[16:00] figuring something might be wrong he
[16:02] decided to investigate
[16:04] as he approached the cabin he saw there
[16:06] were no tracks in the new fallen snow
[16:08] that confirmed his fear that no one had
[16:11] left the cabin after the storm ended he
[16:13] knocked but got no reply when he tried
[16:16] the door he found it was locked from the
[16:18] inside
[16:19] now he knew someone was in there someone
[16:21] who must be in serious trouble or they
[16:23] would have answered him
[16:25] with a great effort he managed to force
[16:27] open the door what he found inside made
[16:30] him shudder
[16:32] and her baby were huddled on the bed
[16:34] almost dead from cold and starvation
[16:37] hurriedly the neighbor grabbed ella's
[16:39] axe and went into the woods bringing
[16:41] back enough fuel to warm the cabin
[16:43] finding no food he trudged home and
[16:45] returned with as many groceries as he
[16:47] could carry calling a doctor was out of
[16:50] the question so the old man took care of
[16:52] the young mother and child himself
[16:54] by the time charles broke through the
[16:56] drift to his cabin his wife and son were
[16:58] starting to recover their strength
[17:01] the rest of that winter charles stayed
[17:03] close to home hunting and trapping to
[17:05] keep the larder filled in the spring he
[17:07] went back to logging after the ice
[17:10] thought he would hitch up an ox to the
[17:12] logs and one by one drag them down to
[17:14] the cumberland river where other loggers
[17:17] would lash them together into a raft
[17:19] float them down to the ohio river and
[17:21] then on to the mississippi
[17:24] in march of 1910 charles and ella had
[17:27] their second child edward a few months
[17:30] later now 16 felt another baby growing
[17:33] in her womb she bore her third child
[17:35] early in 1911. it was another boy she
[17:39] named him henry
[17:41] charles logged through the sprig in
[17:42] summer into the fall of 1911.
[17:45] misfortune struck again ripping charles
[17:48] from his young family and almost
[17:50] destroying him
[17:51] as the youngest of 17 children charles
[17:54] brown had grown up with many rough
[17:56] teachers he learned to hold his whiskey
[17:58] when he was just a boy and he learned to
[18:01] settle disputes with his fists in the
[18:03] fall of 1911 charles was at a party when
[18:06] a fight broke out moonshine and hardened
[18:09] men made a wicked mix and soon the fight
[18:11] grew into a ferocious brawl involving
[18:14] everyone in the room one powerful bully
[18:17] named willie yarburl knocked a friend of
[18:19] charles to the floor jumped on him and
[18:21] drew his knife and was about to plunge
[18:24] it into his heart when charles brought
[18:26] his chair down on willy's head
[18:28] charles backed away and drew his own
[18:30] blade willie forgot the man on the floor
[18:32] and went after charles
[18:35] willywood would have slit charles throat
[18:37] if he had gotten a chance he was a
[18:39] merciless man who had killed his own son
[18:42] with a fence rail but charles knife
[18:44] found its mark first leaving willy in a
[18:46] pool of blood senseless though still
[18:49] alive
[18:50] news of this brawl reached berksville
[18:52] kentucky charles was implicated as a
[18:55] ringleader and charged with attempted
[18:57] murder a sheriff rode up on horseback to
[18:59] arrest him
[19:00] before the sheriff could find him
[19:02] charles caught wind of his danger he had
[19:05] to leave in a hurry not knowing where he
[19:07] would go or what he would do
[19:09] before he left he promised ella that as
[19:11] soon as he found work and a place for
[19:13] them to live he would send for her using
[19:16] an assumed name so he could not be
[19:18] traced and so in the space of an
[19:21] afternoon charles branham vanished
[19:23] leaving his wife alone in the woods to
[19:25] fend for herself and their three babies
[19:28] billy was two and a half edward was one
[19:30] and a half and henry was barely six
[19:33] months old at 17 ella was almost a child
[19:36] herself
[19:38] before a few weeks had passed she
[19:40] realized charles had left a part of
[19:42] himself with her she was pregnant again
[19:45] had fallen winter stretched ella to the
[19:47] limit of her strength she seemed to be
[19:50] living through a nightmare trying to
[19:51] care for three babies in a rude isolated
[19:54] cabin while she herself felt nauseated
[19:57] much of the time she had no money
[20:00] no resources and no energy if it had not
[20:03] been for the help of charles relatives
[20:05] poor as they were ella knew she would
[20:08] not have survived but finally the
[20:10] seasons changed the ground flawed and
[20:12] her nausea ended henry passed his first
[20:15] birthday edward his second and billy his
[20:18] third the baby kicking and twisting in
[20:21] ella's womb was getting near delivery
[20:23] once during that spring of 1912 a
[20:25] sheriff stopped by the cabin asked if
[20:28] ella had heard from her husband she
[20:30] could tell the truth she had not heard
[20:32] from him and had no idea where he was
[20:35] a few days after the sheriff's visit
[20:37] billy and edward were playing outside
[20:39] the cabin where a small spring kept the
[20:41] ground muddy billy wanted to show his
[20:44] younger brother how strong he was so he
[20:46] picked up the biggest rock he could lift
[20:48] held it over his head and threw it
[20:50] towards the spring the rock sank deep
[20:53] into the muck by the water's edge
[20:55] splattering mud all over edward who
[20:57] promptly cried and waddled back to the
[20:59] cabin
[21:00] a robin began to chirp with gusto
[21:03] billy searched the branches until he
[21:05] spied the bird in a nearby tree
[21:08] he took one step toward it and the robin
[21:10] flew away
[21:12] at that moment something so startling
[21:14] happened that it would brand itself to
[21:16] his tender mind it'd become his first
[21:18] significant childhood memory
[21:21] from where the robin had been perched
[21:22] there came a sound like wind rustling
[21:25] the leaves
[21:27] then a voice boomed from the tree a very
[21:30] clear human voice which said
[21:33] you will live near a city called new
[21:35] albany
[21:36] with a shriek of terror billy took off
[21:38] for the cabin as fast as his stubby legs
[21:41] could take him squealing mama mama
[21:45] ella was wiping mud from edward's tummy
[21:47] billy what happened she asked as she
[21:50] hugged her oldest son to her side
[21:52] a bird talked to me mama i heard him
[21:54] singing in the tree then he talked to me
[21:57] ella laughed you were dreaming child but
[22:00] billy insisted i heard him mama i heard
[22:03] him talk
[22:04] and what did the bird say ella tease
[22:06] still thinking it was billy's
[22:08] imagination
[22:09] he said we would live near a city called
[22:11] new albany
[22:13] this reply startled her it did not seem
[22:16] like something a small boy would make up
[22:18] in his play
[22:19] she stepped around behind the cabin and
[22:21] called into the woods hello anybody
[22:24] there when she came back inside billy
[22:27] asked mama where is new albany it's a
[22:30] town in indiana just across the river
[22:32] from louisville kentucky about a hundred
[22:35] miles from here
[22:36] billy where did you hear talk of new
[22:38] albany i ain't never heard of new albany
[22:41] mama until that bird talked to me mama
[22:44] when are we going to live there will
[22:46] papa live there with us
[22:48] ella shook her head
[22:50] several weeks later a long-awaited
[22:52] letter from charles arrived ella sat at

[1:00:20] mighty name of jesus christ we pray amen
[1:00:23] all right
[1:00:24] let me see that again
[1:00:26] so tonight i have just a little
[1:00:30] uh
[1:00:31] is this this message brother branham
[1:00:33] preached this message in 1965
[1:00:37] it's called
[1:00:38] satan's eden
[1:00:42] amen amen
[1:00:44] satan's eden
[1:00:46] and we know that god himself created the
[1:00:50] garden of ed uh the garden of eden
[1:00:53] himself created
[1:00:55] but why president branham
[1:00:57] called this message
[1:00:59] the satan's eden
[1:01:03] it's very interesting
[1:01:06] preaching
[1:01:07] that
[1:01:09] when i was starting this
[1:01:11] and i said god i want to understand why
[1:01:13] brother branham called this
[1:01:16] a
[1:01:17] satan's eden
[1:01:20] what was behind this
[1:01:22] it turns out that
[1:01:24] eden
[1:01:26] is the form of church
[1:01:31] amen amen
[1:01:32] because
[1:01:33] from the beginning brother
[1:01:36] god
[1:01:37] wanted to establish the relationship
[1:01:39] between him a human being
[1:01:42] that was the purpose
[1:01:44] to create
[1:01:45] the garden
[1:01:49] that's it
[1:01:51] nothing else
[1:01:52] just to have the relationship and
[1:01:54] president branham went far and said
[1:01:56] every day
[1:01:57] god came and visited adam and eve
[1:02:00] in the evening time
[1:02:04] which was a type of our age we are
[1:02:06] living in
[1:02:10] morning they woke up
[1:02:12] maybe they used to shower and take
[1:02:14] breakfast and in the evening god came
[1:02:17] at them
[1:02:19] eve are you there they fellowship
[1:02:21] together
[1:02:22] every evening
[1:02:25] now the enemy
[1:02:27] was watching and he was not happy
[1:02:31] about what god was doing with his
[1:02:33] children
[1:02:34] in the garden
[1:02:39] and that's where
[1:02:40] the matter started
[1:02:43] and that's where the issues start
[1:02:45] until today
[1:02:47] now brothers and sisters
[1:02:49] in order for you to know what is going
[1:02:53] on you need to identify yourself
[1:02:56] in the age where you are living in
[1:02:59] for you to know exactly where am i
[1:03:03] and that's the problem the church has
[1:03:05] today
[1:03:06] a lot of people they don't know how to
[1:03:08] identify themselves in the scriptures
[1:03:12] be because if i don't identify myself in
[1:03:15] the scriptures as brothers are pastor
[1:03:17] one preachers last night uh last sunday
[1:03:20] how are you going to convince yourself
[1:03:27] because the scripture
[1:03:28] is very very very open
[1:03:31] but how can you identify yourself into
[1:03:34] these scriptures
[1:03:36] and that's how you know really if you
[1:03:38] are in satan's eden or you are on god's
[1:03:42] side
[1:03:46] amen amen
[1:03:48] and i'm so glad because today
[1:03:51] is the birthday of our prophet
[1:03:54] amen amen
[1:03:56] it has a a big impact on us
[1:04:00] what kind of birthday oh it's a brand
[1:04:02] name birthday but
[1:04:04] dig inside pray god why brother brandon
[1:04:07] came it's not just a normal birthday
[1:04:09] brother
[1:04:10] amen amen so now to identify yourself in
[1:04:13] a scripture is when you're gonna see
[1:04:16] yourself in a scripture that means you
[1:04:18] see and say ah that's me an example
[1:04:22] the
[1:04:22] this samaritan woman
[1:04:26] how she identified jesus christ
[1:04:30] by the scripture because she identified
[1:04:32] herself in the age that she was living
[1:04:35] in she said this is the age where the
[1:04:37] messiah should come and when the messiah
[1:04:40] will come this is what the messiah will
[1:04:43] do
[1:04:46] and that was the word mere flesh on her
[1:04:49] edge that she was living in
[1:04:52] lord nobody preach her
[1:04:55] but the way jesus christ was explaining
[1:04:58] to her
[1:05:00] the way just class was describing
[1:05:03] himself to her she knew ah
[1:05:06] this is what isaiah said
[1:05:09] when the messiah will come
[1:05:12] this is what will happen
[1:05:14] he will tell us
[1:05:16] the thought of our heart
[1:05:19] now she ran
[1:05:20] in a village and tell people come and
[1:05:23] see
[1:05:24] a young man
[1:05:27] who is telling me exactly what is my
[1:05:30] life
[1:05:33] what's that
[1:05:35] she identified herself in the scripture
[1:05:39] so for her to know exactly where she is
[1:05:44] and that's what
[1:05:46] believers
[1:05:48] need to do
[1:05:50] can you just say i'm the message
[1:05:52] believer
[1:05:53] but identify yourself in
[1:05:56] don't just follow people to church
[1:05:58] because you are following them but you
[1:06:00] need to identify yourself in a scripture
[1:06:04] because once you identify yourself in
[1:06:06] the scripture that's when you're gonna
[1:06:09] see the relationship between you and god
[1:06:11] coming in common
[1:06:14] because you remember your salvation is
[1:06:16] personal between you and god
[1:06:21] my wife and
[1:06:23] my wife's salvation is not under me no
[1:06:26] my kids no
[1:06:29] it's just me and my god
[1:06:32] amen amen and that's what you have to
[1:06:35] what to do my precious brother sisters
[1:06:39] so on this last age
[1:06:42] i'm gonna just cut straight in this last
[1:06:44] age
[1:06:46] what do we have
[1:06:49] why brother branham say
[1:06:51] this is the settings heading
[1:06:55] because the church is in a situation
[1:06:58] where
[1:06:58] people claim that they are christians
[1:07:01] but they are not
[1:07:11] what a
[1:07:12] christian
[1:07:14] what kind of christian are you
[1:07:16] what kind of christian am i
[1:07:22] because
[1:07:23] in a garden
[1:07:24] when satan the serpent came and talked
[1:07:27] to eve
[1:07:28] by the time that she seduced eve
[1:07:32] that's when she went away from the way
[1:07:34] of god
[1:07:39] at the same time
[1:07:41] god stepped out of dargen
[1:07:44] now that became a territory of the devil
[1:07:50] god was not there anymore
[1:07:56] each time when god says something
[1:07:59] and you don't apply yourself to the word
[1:08:01] god said my precious brother i'm telling
[1:08:04] you that territory become devil's
[1:08:07] playground
[1:08:14] that's when we're going to pray there's
[1:08:15] no answer
[1:08:17] because god is not there anymore you
[1:08:19] become a cross land
[1:08:22] and once you become a consulate now the
[1:08:24] devil is there and once the devil is
[1:08:27] there he's gonna come and lie to people
[1:08:29] with a false preaching
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:35] and once we become a false preaching now
[1:08:38] the devil is gonna just read the
[1:08:40] scripture but you can't really get the
[1:08:43] full meaning of what really the preacher
[1:08:45] is saying because god is not there
[1:08:48] because the life of god is not there
[1:08:50] anymore
[1:08:54] that's why you see people they're not
[1:08:55] changing
[1:08:57] you come to church but people never
[1:08:59] change you still the same
[1:09:01] when you see a little one i think i can
[1:09:03] get a little one there
[1:09:07] you see a little small ah i think i can
[1:09:09] smoke a little bit
[1:09:14] you see whatever woman oh i think i can
[1:09:16] talk to her
[1:09:18] all these kind of things
[1:09:21] because maybe you are in a land that is
[1:09:23] already cursed
[1:09:27] so now is me and you to identify really
[1:09:30] exactly which side are we
[1:09:37] my precious brothers and sisters being
[1:09:38] in a message
[1:09:40] is not sufficient
[1:09:41] just say i am in a message
[1:09:45] it's
[1:09:46] not but leave the message
[1:09:50] that's what the holy ghost wants you to
[1:09:52] do my precious brother
[1:09:55] you need to leave the message
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:58] amen glory to god amen amen
[1:10:01] now
[1:10:02] let's read the let's read brother
[1:10:04] brandon a little bit here
[1:10:06] i'd like to read bruce branagh
[1:10:08] so
[1:10:11] settings garden we're gonna read uh
[1:10:15] page three paragraph thirteen
[1:10:18] let's see what preservation i'm saying
[1:10:19] here
[1:10:22] i want to speak to you
[1:10:25] something to bring
[1:10:28] to establish
[1:10:29] to
[1:10:31] to alliance to you the promise of god
[1:10:34] for this age see
[1:10:36] something not something that
[1:10:39] somebody else was in
[1:10:42] some other day
[1:10:44] but something you know how brother
[1:10:46] branagh used to repeat himself
[1:10:48] and then
[1:10:50] them
[1:10:51] things are all right
[1:10:55] we only refer to those things
[1:10:57] but
[1:10:58] i brought
[1:11:00] but i thought
[1:11:02] i will try to bring something to your
[1:11:04] mind
[1:11:05] with this scripture
[1:11:07] i got written here
[1:11:10] that
[1:11:11] will enlighten you to know
[1:11:14] to make you
[1:11:16] a better soldier
[1:11:18] in the field that you are fighting in
[1:11:21] now
[1:11:22] to learn the tactic of the enemy so that
[1:11:26] you can block everything before he gets
[1:11:30] to you
[1:11:31] see
[1:11:32] that's the main thing
[1:11:35] is the loan to keep the punch
[1:11:39] of you
[1:11:40] as much as you can
[1:11:44] amen amen
[1:11:46] because we know the enemy is there
[1:11:47] brother
[1:11:48] he's looking for his looking for me and
[1:11:51] i'm gonna tell you one thing the enemy
[1:11:52] is not looking for denominations nah
[1:11:55] because he knows that's that's that's my
[1:11:57] territory
[1:11:59] he's looking for those who are not in
[1:12:02] his territory
[1:12:09] now in this last age what god have done
[1:12:12] for us
[1:12:15] what god have done for us on this last
[1:12:17] age
[1:12:19] because we were lost
[1:12:22] that's why i mean sometimes i said to
[1:12:24] people
[1:12:25] just claiming jesus christ is my savior
[1:12:27] as my savior even the devil he knows
[1:12:31] the devil knows that jesus christ
[1:12:33] is my savior
[1:12:34] he knows that word
[1:12:37] but tell
[1:12:38] tell the devil to believe brother
[1:12:39] branham as his prophet he'll never
[1:12:43] amen amen he'll never do that
[1:12:46] why because he knows that this prophet
[1:12:49] came to reveal everything from genesis
[1:12:52] to revelation
[1:12:55] and anyone who's listening to this
[1:12:57] prophet that means they know the tactic
[1:13:00] they're not to tackle me down
[1:13:09] now on this day
[1:13:11] the birthday of brother branham
[1:13:14] now is me and you to ask ourselves
[1:13:16] really what happened
[1:13:19] why president branham came
[1:13:28] it's been more than 100 years
[1:13:31] since
[1:13:32] brother mr brother was born
[1:13:36] until today
[1:13:38] now before that
[1:13:40] you have to see before that what
[1:13:41] happened because before that we were
[1:13:44] living in a dark ages
[1:13:47] nothing was revealed
[1:13:49] the devil was really in his territory he
[1:13:52] was playing around until branham was
[1:13:55] born now
[1:13:57] and then we have revelation 10 be
[1:14:00] fulfilled
[1:14:02] everything came to light
[1:14:06] after everything come to light now you
[1:14:09] my brother my sister was sitting there
[1:14:11] that's when now you came and said this
[1:14:13] is true
[1:14:14] because me and you we were in a
[1:14:16] denomination
[1:14:17] because we had the seed of god in us now
[1:14:20] when you heard
[1:14:22] that voice of god
[1:14:24] talking to you
[1:14:26] because the seed is like this you are
[1:14:28] the seed
[1:14:29] and then you have the ground right so
[1:14:31] the ground that's where you put the city
[1:14:33] in
[1:14:34] now you have the light
[1:14:37] the light that's god voice when you are
[1:14:40] in the ground as i said when you listen
[1:14:43] to the word of god that's the seed now
[1:14:46] yo you're gonna start coming out from
[1:14:48] the ground
[1:14:49] because the light is touching the ground
[1:14:52] now you start coming out
[1:14:54] because you listen to the word of god
[1:14:57] that was pretty scenario for you
[1:15:03] because there's a many seed brother
[1:15:06] everyone has a seat
[1:15:10] everyone has a seat now
[1:15:12] who are those
[1:15:14] that when the lights came and hit the
[1:15:17] ground and came out
[1:15:22] because i remember when i was uh
[1:15:24] well when i was a little kid
[1:15:27] my mom and i we used to go to uh
[1:15:30] um
[1:15:31] just
[1:15:32] to his fe to her field just to to plant
[1:15:35] some some um
[1:15:37] some beans oh
[1:15:39] oh
[1:15:40] to plants um
[1:15:42] uh some cassava or anything
[1:15:45] so when we're in a field
[1:15:47] in the farmer so we we just get there
[1:15:49] and we put like uh i can say like mace
[1:15:53] right
[1:15:54] corn we put corn in
[1:15:57] and then my mom said joseph
[1:15:59] you're gonna see it's not all these
[1:16:02] condoms we put in the ground all of them
[1:16:04] are gonna come out even though they look
[1:16:06] good
[1:16:07] some of them they're gonna be
[1:16:10] just dead
[1:16:11] and i was like why
[1:16:13] i said yeah that's the way it is
[1:16:16] and i said that's the way it is how i
[1:16:18] say yeah it's not me it's all about god
[1:16:22] i said okay
[1:16:23] and really
[1:16:24] three four days later
[1:16:26] i came back with my mom and you're gonna
[1:16:28] see the line that we put those uh those
[1:16:32] go in
[1:16:33] some of them did not come out
[1:16:36] someone yeah to be honest
[1:16:38] and then we go back and we
[1:16:41] take them out and put another one there
[1:16:43] the next day that one came out say ah
[1:16:46] what happened
[1:16:48] that one you don't have life in
[1:16:51] that's the same way
[1:16:54] you're gonna see how many people
[1:16:56] maybe they preach you this message with
[1:16:59] somebody else but you listen but
[1:17:01] somebody said no that's not for me
[1:17:04] that's the same way brother
[1:17:09] you've been listening the message with
[1:17:10] somebody else but you heard you say
[1:17:13] this is for me
[1:17:14] you said a man
[1:17:16] because you listened
[1:17:19] because say this is mine
[1:17:21] because somebody was telling you that ah
[1:17:24] adam and eve they ate apple
[1:17:27] but you heard the prophet came and said
[1:17:29] brother that was not apple and he said
[1:17:31] this is what i was looking for it's not
[1:17:34] apple i know something was right
[1:17:37] something was not right it's not apple
[1:17:39] now you
[1:17:41] just get there and you listen now and
[1:17:44] then you say this is mine you get it
[1:17:50] and once you get it now you live it
[1:17:54] and once you leave it now the holy ghost
[1:17:56] came in your life now you become a world
[1:17:59] flesh walking in the street of
[1:18:00] minneapolis
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:05] and that's how god deals with all of us
[1:18:08] we need to reach that maturity
[1:18:11] of living the world
[1:18:17] that's where we used to go
[1:18:21] some others they used to be there and
[1:18:24] then they say i'm tired of this message
[1:18:27] i'm going back
[1:18:29] that mean it was not meant for you
[1:18:31] i'm not surprised
[1:18:33] because for me brother i'm telling you
[1:18:35] every single day that i listen
[1:18:38] to this message is new
[1:18:41] it can be the same message they preach
[1:18:42] for me brother every day every day is
[1:18:45] new brother
[1:18:48] because it's a spiritual food it's a
[1:18:50] food brother
[1:18:52] it's food
[1:18:58] we eat every day right
[1:19:00] we eat every day
[1:19:02] forget about
[1:19:04] just okay i'm in prayer i'm just uh
[1:19:07] fasting no no fussy just eat every day
[1:19:09] for you to survive
[1:19:11] right you eat breakfast
[1:19:13] dinner
[1:19:14] and
[1:19:15] so lunch and dinner maybe you eat just
[1:19:17] breakfast and dinner every
[1:19:20] day who have been tired of eating
[1:19:24] tell me
[1:19:27] nobody
[1:19:28] you see
[1:19:29] now is the same
[1:19:30] in the same way with the word of god
[1:19:33] every day you listen to the lord of god
[1:19:34] you rejoice brother you rejoice say yes
[1:19:37] this is mine
[1:19:40] you never go back brother
[1:19:42] if this was meant for you brother you're
[1:19:44] gonna keep going every single day
[1:19:48] every single day gonna keep going
[1:19:50] you're gonna be listening to it and
[1:19:52] you're gonna keep rejoicing every single
[1:19:54] day and whenever you go to the street
[1:19:56] you're gonna testify the goodness of
[1:19:58] jesus christ
[1:20:04] now going back
[1:20:06] adam and eve
[1:20:08] in that garden was just god was trying
[1:20:11] to establish that relationship
[1:20:13] and that's what god wants today brother
[1:20:17] this message is to bring us back
[1:20:22] to what we have lost
[1:20:30] i think whenever pastor one is going to
[1:20:31] start preaching about the 70 uh the 70
[1:20:35] weeks of daniel you're gonna understand
[1:20:36] what i'm talking about
[1:20:38] is to bring us back
[1:20:41] to eden
[1:20:44] because that's what god was made hidden
[1:20:46] for that
[1:20:48] it was not for fun it was not just
[1:20:50] because there's a lot of trees there no
[1:20:51] brother
[1:20:52] god wants to visit you face to face
[1:20:56] because adam was able to see god face to
[1:20:59] face now today we can see god first of
[1:21:01] all because we have this flesh because
[1:21:03] we have sin between us
[1:21:06] now that sin that's what
[1:21:09] put a barrier between us and god now the
[1:21:12] only way you can talk to god is to talk
[1:21:15] to god through the scripture
[1:21:18] because the scripture does what can
[1:21:20] clean you and you can see god in another
[1:21:23] form which is spiritual
[1:21:25] but before adam and eve they couldn't
[1:21:28] see god's spiritual brother they'll seek
[1:21:30] god first to face like it is like i'm
[1:21:32] seeing my brother here
[1:21:35] amen
[1:21:37] now the only way for you to go back
[1:21:39] there is to get out of the zone of the
[1:21:43] devil's eden
[1:21:47] because that zone is so dangerous
[1:21:50] it's a zone where you can see god
[1:21:56] it's a zone where the preachers
[1:21:59] they're gonna just tell you what you
[1:22:01] want to hear
[1:22:06] they won't tell you exactly really what
[1:22:09] your soul want
[1:22:12] is a zone where the devil have taken
[1:22:14] everything the flesh the scripture they
[1:22:17] mix it up together and he gave to you
[1:22:22] and once you have everything mixed up
[1:22:24] brother
[1:22:27] you have nothing left
[1:22:31] but because if you can understand pretty
[1:22:33] good brother
[1:22:34] back then i remember
[1:22:37] because my mother she's a uh
[1:22:39] she's a pantocratist
[1:22:45] she's not a message believer
[1:22:49] i remember when i was a little
[1:22:50] kid five years or six years old
[1:22:53] i used to go with my mom
[1:22:56] pentagon's church but
[1:22:58] brother they used to cry a lot
[1:23:00] when they go to church
[1:23:03] they cry
[1:23:04] the preachers preaching people are
[1:23:06] crying or praying it's like they're
[1:23:08] touching them but today is different
[1:23:11] story
[1:23:13] people are so comfortable in a church
[1:23:15] like they're in a club
[1:23:18] it's like they want to drink some
[1:23:20] marijuana and drink i don't know what so
[1:23:22] they're so comfortable some of them they
[1:23:25] have their phones they put their yeah
[1:23:29] so what's that
[1:23:33] the devil has mixed everything up
[1:23:36] brother
[1:23:38] and that's what the devil want to bring
[1:23:40] into this message to us what
[1:23:43] that's why we should be so careful
[1:23:45] that's why matthew 24 said
[1:23:48] if it was possible
[1:23:52] you have to see what kind of seduction
[1:23:54] is that
[1:23:55] yes amen
[1:23:57] amen
[1:24:00] because we are elected because you are
[1:24:03] elected
[1:24:04] that's why you can't be deceived
[1:24:09] other than that brother you could be
[1:24:16] back then it wasn't like that
[1:24:18] people are so comfortable today in the
[1:24:20] churches
[1:24:21] they just sit there
[1:24:23] they just listen
[1:24:24] and some of them maybe they have their
[1:24:26] girlfriend and
[1:24:28] and then you ask yourself is this a
[1:24:30] church or is this
[1:24:32] so what is going on
[1:24:40] now when the brother brother came
[1:24:42] brother
[1:24:44] the whole story changed
[1:24:48] that's why mia called him the prophet of
[1:24:51] all prophets
[1:24:56] it's a great day today it's his birthday
[1:25:00] but look around
[1:25:02] what he has done
[1:25:04] jesus christ himself spoke into a human
[1:25:07] being
[1:25:11] what jesus christ have done on the cross
[1:25:13] brother branham himself is just part of
[1:25:16] the salvation amen
[1:25:19] he was to pay the price
[1:25:23] but the redemption was coming
[1:25:30] what jesus christ have done on the cross
[1:25:32] my preachers brother everyone can talk
[1:25:34] about it
[1:25:38] but now who can come now and talk about
[1:25:41] the bride
[1:25:43] the spiritual food of the bride
[1:25:46] because the bra after jesus christ on
[1:25:48] the cross there was a lot of work to do
[1:25:50] brother
[1:25:52] there was a lot of work to do until
[1:25:54] today
[1:25:56] they still have work to do that's why i
[1:25:57] said the devil he knows what jesus could
[1:26:00] have done on the cross
[1:26:02] but the devil didn't know really exactly
[1:26:05] what the bride needs for the rapture
[1:26:13] because that rapture
[1:26:15] you needed a real food a really
[1:26:18] spiritual food
[1:26:20] for you to go on a rapture
[1:26:24] and that's what a lot of people they are
[1:26:25] missing today
[1:26:30] because when you have their food their
[1:26:32] food is going to give you the access
[1:26:35] the key
[1:26:37] to go to rapture
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:43] now god had to send someone
[1:26:47] behold i'll send you elijah the prophet
[1:26:51] be foul
[1:26:53] jesus christ before he said that on
[1:26:56] malachi cut he knew that
[1:26:58] okay i'll be on a cross
[1:27:01] but it's not sufficient until elijah
[1:27:04] come again and preach again
[1:27:07] amen remember it's still the same jesus
[1:27:10] christ
[1:27:11] he's still the same jesus christ brother
[1:27:18] but the true food
[1:27:21] because the devil have mixed up
[1:27:23] everything up
[1:27:26] now to bring people out of the confusion
[1:27:29] god had to send
[1:27:33] luke
[1:27:34] 17 30.
[1:27:36] god had to send malachi 4.
[1:27:40] god had to send revelation 10 7.
[1:27:43] amen amen
[1:27:45] these are the scriptures that people are
[1:27:47] passing by every day
[1:27:49] every day they are passing by
[1:27:53] one day i was talking to one of my
[1:27:55] brothers i say do you know about malachi
[1:27:57] 4. malachi 4 what i said malakai fo
[1:28:00] he went and read malakai for say ah that
[1:28:03] john baptist i said no
[1:28:05] read malachi 3 malachi 3 oh
[1:28:08] yeah it looks like makkai 3 does yeah
[1:28:11] now you have to look for malachi 4.
[1:28:15] now you're going to have to go to look
[1:28:17] for malachi 4. because right now we have
[1:28:19] only malachi
[1:28:21] 3.
[1:28:22] you know my akai 3 is john baptist right
[1:28:27] because john
[1:28:28] because john baptist he didn't come
[1:28:31] on a day of judgment
[1:28:33] no
[1:28:36] but this malachi we're talking about
[1:28:38] here
[1:28:40] is the day of judgment
[1:28:42] before this day brother found this guy
[1:28:45] if you find this guy
[1:28:47] you're gonna miss uh that means you're
[1:28:49] gonna escape this day
[1:28:51] amen amen you're going to find this
[1:28:53] prophet found this prophet and you're
[1:28:56] going to see yourself in a rapture
[1:29:01] and this brother was like i'm confused i
[1:29:02] said brother we need to pray
[1:29:05] this brother didn't understand at all i
[1:29:07] said okay let's pray
[1:29:09] i keep telling him about about malachi
[1:29:12] 4. until he understood that malachi 4
[1:29:15] is another elijah who's coming
[1:29:18] before the judgment
[1:29:20] and when he will come he will establish
[1:29:24] everything
[1:29:25] the restoration of the word of god the
[1:29:28] resurrection of the bride
[1:29:40] something if they say restoration means
[1:29:43] what first of all that word restoration
[1:29:45] i'm not an english you know so native
[1:29:49] who's a
[1:29:50] okay i might just say this who is pure
[1:29:52] american here brother maybe you
[1:29:54] restoration meanwhile the restoration to
[1:29:56] restore
[1:29:57] to bring it back to its original
[1:29:59] condition
[1:30:01] did you hear that
[1:30:02] to bring back to
[1:30:04] brother speak up speak out brother
[1:30:07] did you bring back to an original
[1:30:09] condition thank you so much
[1:30:11] to bring back to the original condition
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:18] that's what they call restoration
[1:30:24] because even jesus christ said
[1:30:28] in matthew 9 i think
[1:30:30] when his disciples said hey we said oh
[1:30:33] maybe the scripture said that elijah
[1:30:34] will come and say yes elijah has come
[1:30:38] come
[1:30:40] oh
[1:30:42] but that karma says something brother
[1:30:46] jesus christ said about to elijah yes
[1:30:49] elijah
[1:30:51] he all yeah he's here
[1:30:54] karma
[1:30:56] but when now the same second one will
[1:30:58] come he will restore
[1:31:09] now that restoration that's what the
[1:31:12] bride wants
[1:31:13] that's restoration that's what will take
[1:31:16] you to the rapture brother
[1:31:19] because since this event
[1:31:22] was already messed up by this by satan
[1:31:25] now god had to send someone
[1:31:28] to restore everything
[1:31:31] from genesis all the way
[1:31:35] to revelation
[1:31:40] amen i like that i like that definition
[1:31:43] brother
[1:31:46] bring it back to original like the
[1:31:49] original
[1:31:50] okay i don't know how to say it
[1:31:52] oh man
[1:31:56] that's sufficient brother that's good
[1:31:59] bring it back to original it's like it's
[1:32:01] like something that was already broken
[1:32:05] now you have some a original engineer
[1:32:08] who need to come and repair it exactly
[1:32:11] the way it works
[1:32:18] without putting anything in between
[1:32:21] nothing in there brother
[1:32:25] if you are true christian this is the
[1:32:27] way it should be
[1:32:29] bring back judge order
[1:32:32] this the way it was
[1:32:34] paul said if an angel came from heaven
[1:32:37] and preached another one hi
[1:32:43] that kind of restoration that we needed
[1:32:46] and that kind of preaching was already
[1:32:48] lost brother
[1:32:50] until when president came
[1:32:55] you wanna be a deacon
[1:32:58] you gotta be married
[1:33:00] only one wife
[1:33:01] no divorce no girlfriend here just one
[1:33:05] you wanna be a pastor yes
[1:33:07] you gotta be married one wife
[1:33:10] not divorced
[1:33:20] you wanna preach as a woman go ask your
[1:33:22] husband at home
[1:33:26] now the devil said ah
[1:33:29] human right to watch or i don't know
[1:33:31] whatever human right you know everybody
[1:33:33] is ego we are all ego yes we are yes of
[1:33:36] course we are amen but in front of god
[1:33:40] there's a limit
[1:33:42] there's an order
[1:33:47] that's the restoration that we needed a
[1:33:49] brother
[1:33:50] in this commemoration of brother branham
[1:33:52] birthday
[1:33:54] this is what blasphemy came to tell us
[1:34:01] that's what we needed brother
[1:34:05] identifying ourselves in a scripture
[1:34:08] when you read when you see exactly where
[1:34:11] am i and you can see ready this is me
[1:34:15] and that's why you can jump and say amen
[1:34:19] that woman to the to that to that pool
[1:34:21] the way she jumped brother because she
[1:34:24] saw herself in a scripture
[1:34:27] the reason why you believe this message
[1:34:29] brother and sister because you saw
[1:34:30] yourself in there
[1:34:36] and that's what we should teach our
[1:34:38] children
[1:34:39] because you were born in a message it
[1:34:41] does you have to identify yourself in a
[1:34:43] message
[1:34:48] yes
[1:34:49] our children
[1:34:51] on their turn you need to identify
[1:34:53] yourself in
[1:34:55] the scripture
[1:34:59] don't just follow me as your father i'm
[1:35:01] gonna tell you barack obama identify
[1:35:03] yourself earlier at least identify
[1:35:05] yourself because those are my children
[1:35:07] i'm gonna tell them identify yourself by
[1:35:09] telling them by preaching them every day
[1:35:12] so they can understand what the message
[1:35:14] means for them
[1:35:18] don't just follow me because i'm your
[1:35:19] father
[1:35:21] amen
[1:35:23] but come and cry and say god i need you
[1:35:29] i need to see you god
[1:35:31] in this last age
[1:35:33] you have sent someone
[1:35:36] who's gonna be there for me
[1:35:39] you spoke into someone
[1:35:46] because that's the way it's supposed to
[1:35:48] be because the promise is on those last
[1:35:51] days he will send
[1:35:53] a lie to the prophet
[1:35:55] elijah the prophet according to luke 17
[1:35:59] 30 that's the son of
[1:36:02] man
[1:36:03] that's a prophet
[1:36:07] because there's a difference between the
[1:36:08] son of man and the son of god
[1:36:11] amen amen so now the way god came in
[1:36:15] this last age he came as a prophet
[1:36:25] as he identified himself as a prophet
[1:36:27] that's when he spoke into a prophet
[1:36:31] and this is where we are today
[1:36:38] the devil have broken every single thing
[1:36:40] brother
[1:36:43] the deception is so high how they are my
[1:36:46] precious brothers and sisters
[1:36:48] everywhere you look around is deception
[1:36:54] you turn around your tv is deception
[1:36:57] eternally your phone is deception you go
[1:36:59] to work it's worse
[1:37:01] you're gonna street is worse
[1:37:08] how can you stay in the land of the
[1:37:10] message
[1:37:12] how can you
[1:37:13] my personal brother is by prayer
[1:37:16] prayer is the key
[1:37:21] that's the only way you're gonna come
[1:37:23] out of there my precious brother
[1:37:26] there's another thing going on out there
[1:37:29] that's why he's saying all i'm the
[1:37:31] message believer brother is not really
[1:37:33] sufficient
[1:37:37] you gotta go farther than that
[1:37:40] you gotta keep pushing
[1:37:44] and when you push hard
[1:37:46] and that's why you pray hard and you
[1:37:48] read the message hard and you read your
[1:37:50] bible hard and you keep coming to church
[1:37:52] and that's how the holy ghost will come
[1:37:54] in your life
[1:37:56] because you are crying out to god god i
[1:37:58] need your help god i'm here there's a
[1:38:01] deception out there i don't know because
[1:38:03] in this zone
[1:38:06] of the devil
[1:38:11] by crying out
[1:38:14] by singing amazing grace
[1:38:16] it's a really amazing christmas precious
[1:38:18] brother
[1:38:21] to get into this message
[1:38:24] is an amazing grace and never seen in my
[1:38:26] life
[1:38:28] because if we can start test testifying
[1:38:32] my testimony i can take two days brother
[1:38:35] me a little boy like this i know my
[1:38:37] minute is over
[1:38:39] me i used to steal like crazy
[1:38:42] you know back in africa
[1:38:44] back back in maybe early 2000s when i
[1:38:47] was maybe
[1:38:48] 10 years old 9 years old something like
[1:38:50] that you know we used to have like the
[1:38:52] cinema you know so you go to cinema and
[1:38:55] then they have a big tv with um

[1:43:51] giving to this church for transforming
[1:43:54] my son into a better person
[1:43:57] but she never believed the message
[1:44:00] she did that one for me

[1:44:12] amen amen
[1:44:13] that is now
[1:44:15] now can you imagine
[1:44:17] at that age
[1:44:18] if i could continue like that when i was
[1:44:21] that age today i could be
[1:44:23] maybe
[1:44:24] maybe a big gangster
[1:44:29] smoking and marijuana and do anything so
[1:44:33] maybe i couldn't be here today
[1:44:40] now you're gonna tell me that i'm bored
[1:44:42] of this message
[1:44:43] no
[1:44:44] no brother no
[1:44:46] no brother
[1:44:48] i'm gonna keep going i'm gonna keep
[1:44:50] fighting
[1:44:51] fighting every day
[1:44:54] never be tired brother
[1:44:57] never
[1:45:00] never be tired brother
[1:45:02] keep going
[1:45:04] keep praying every day
[1:45:06] because there's something that you can
[1:45:08] hear but when i put my foot in that
[1:45:10] church brother as a 10 years old boy
[1:45:12] like this boy i'm telling you i heard
[1:45:14] something different and never even the
[1:45:16] atmosphere
[1:45:18] you know when you go to catholic church
[1:45:19] there's those here thinking people are
[1:45:22] running like this but when i went there
[1:45:24] the only the only thing i could hear it
[1:45:27] was the paper
[1:45:40] oh man something is right no something i
[1:45:44] could feel that deep that the atmosphere
[1:45:46] was
[1:45:47] different
[1:45:52] and then i was speechless
[1:45:55] at the same time observing what is going
[1:45:58] on in there
[1:46:00] i'll just keep my my my hand like this
[1:46:03] and when they start preaching
[1:46:05] brother it's like they are preaching to
[1:46:06] it's like that day even i talk to my
[1:46:09] brother i say did you take that preacher
[1:46:10] that's that's me that you know that's me
[1:46:12] i was doing all this i said no brother
[1:46:14] he doesn't know even you
[1:46:17] i cried
[1:46:20] like a baby
[1:46:24] one year later i was baptized 12 years
[1:46:26] old
[1:46:30] until today
[1:46:32] and the sunday that i show up to that
[1:46:34] church message beautiful church that the
[1:46:36] same sunday i was supposed to serve
[1:46:39] to the catholic church and i was
[1:46:41] supposed to you know to take that long
[1:46:43] cross like that because i was the
[1:46:44] servant
[1:46:48] my
[1:46:49] my fellow servant they came to my house
[1:46:51] said joseph didn't show up i said i'm
[1:46:52] not coming back
[1:46:54] the same day i told them i'm not coming
[1:46:56] back brother
[1:46:58] until today
[1:47:02] hallelujah
[1:47:04] that's what i said everyone has a
[1:47:06] testimony you're supposed to build a
[1:47:09] testimony with god
[1:47:11] your relationship with god the
[1:47:13] experience with god
[1:47:14] you have to build that
[1:47:18] because when i remember
[1:47:20] where god took me from brother
[1:47:23] no
[1:47:25] you better cut my head off
[1:47:27] you cut it off brother
[1:47:29] i cannot deny this message i'll never
[1:47:32] you cut my head off yes
[1:47:38] and that's what we need for us to go
[1:47:40] back to eden
[1:47:42] build that relationship
[1:47:44] with god his personal brother is
[1:47:47] personal because my experience is
[1:47:49] different from your experience different
[1:47:51] from yours different from
[1:47:52] from our pastor
[1:47:55] build your own
[1:47:56] have your own relationship with god
[1:48:00] fellowship with god god love love to
[1:48:03] fellowship brother
[1:48:04] that's what god wants
[1:48:07] the only way i can find you with him
[1:48:08] just read the bible read your message
[1:48:11] and pray you're gonna say he's gonna
[1:48:13] talk to you brother i'm telling you
[1:48:14] since the ego he gonna talk to you he
[1:48:17] have come to you and he would you gonna
[1:48:18] hear he would have talked
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:23] [Applause]
[1:48:24] he is gonna talk to you you're gonna
[1:48:27] hear god talk because i heard god talk
[1:48:29] to me
[1:48:38] i mean it's up
[1:48:41] that's the only way you can do it
[1:48:42] brother
[1:48:48] have that fellowship with god
[1:48:52] i do believe in fellowship
[1:48:54] when a brother and sister came together
[1:48:56] i do believe in that
[1:48:59] i do believe when when when
[1:49:02] when a christian
[1:49:03] want to develop that relationship with
[1:49:05] god that's the only way you can overcome
[1:49:08] your anxiety
[1:49:09] that's the only time you can become your
[1:49:11] you know overcome your fear
[1:49:13] everything that you are going through is
[1:49:15] through that fellowship with god
[1:49:19] because this message is taking you back
[1:49:22] to eden what we have lost that's why
[1:49:25] it's taking you back brother
[1:49:27] don't expect anything more if you want
[1:49:29] to go back to edinburgh you're going to
[1:49:31] go back there because now you know the
[1:49:33] tactic of the devil
[1:49:35] this message came to reveal the devil to
[1:49:38] put him out
[1:49:47] thank you jesus and once he's out
[1:49:49] there's nothing he can do
[1:49:54] is now me and you to leave the message
[1:49:57] to stay in the line
[1:49:59] and to read between the line to stay in
[1:50:02] the land and to read between the line
[1:50:06] that's how we can overcome this
[1:50:11] because i know
[1:50:12] near
[1:50:13] close is very like the end is very near
[1:50:18] very very very like like right there
[1:50:20] it's coming
[1:50:24] i think the last uh i think the first
[1:50:26] time i speak over here say let's be
[1:50:28] ready
[1:50:30] and the only one and the one way we're
[1:50:32] gonna be ready is to leave this message
[1:50:37] thank you let's be there
[1:50:42] amen amen
[1:50:44] i really thank everyone for the time
[1:50:47] and i appreciate brother brazawan for
[1:50:50] giving me this opportunity and
[1:50:53] i believe that uh
[1:50:55] the time will come
[1:50:56] we're going to meet again and we're
[1:50:58] going to be together
[1:51:01] it's a really hard moment for me to uh
[1:51:03] to leave this place but
[1:51:06] i'm still your child
[1:51:09] my wife is there my kids and everyone
[1:51:11] and i'm
[1:51:12] you're gonna see me here coming like
[1:51:15] back and forth you're gonna see me here
[1:51:17] coming back and forth because we are in
[1:51:19] this journey together
[1:51:21] i'm not alone you are not alone i need
[1:51:24] your prayer you need my prayers
[1:51:26] that's all i can give you and also we
[1:51:28] need to pray for our pastor
[1:51:33] you need to pray for one another
[1:51:36] that's the only that that's that's the
[1:51:38] only thing i can really ask
[1:51:41] the church
[1:51:43] because you remember
[1:51:44] when when disciples
[1:51:47] they were like persecuted
[1:51:51] the only way they used to come you know
[1:51:53] to
[1:51:54] to stay united was prayer
[1:51:56] paul was that side philippe was on that
[1:51:58] side but was prayer
[1:52:02] when daniel was in babylon
[1:52:05] the only time he used to say this is the
[1:52:07] time i need to so there was a window
[1:52:10] that was facing israel and it was a time
[1:52:13] for him to pray and he went there and
[1:52:15] pray
[1:52:17] he stay connected to god
[1:52:19] honor with prayers
[1:52:23] that's the only way we can overcome this
[1:52:24] brother
[1:52:26] because time is coming
[1:52:28] and that time is very
[1:52:30] very very very near
[1:52:33] and we really thank god for this message
[1:52:37] because it's a truth that everyone out
[1:52:39] there is looking for
[1:52:42] and you are here brothers and sisters
[1:52:44] because you are predestinated to listen
[1:52:46] to this message
[1:52:49] as i said earlier there's a lot of
[1:52:50] people that maybe you heard this message
[1:52:52] together but they never believe it
[1:52:55] why you why me that's what you can ask
[1:52:59] yourself
[1:53:02] i'm not wasting my time you know wasting
[1:53:04] yours
[1:53:05] is god trying to invest his word in you
[1:53:08] maybe there's someone out there who need
[1:53:10] this message that's why when you eat
[1:53:13] you're gonna let me get to somebody else
[1:53:15] and then you tell them about the message
[1:53:17] you bring them back again to the bride
[1:53:19] of god
[1:53:20] i'm telling you this time is not going
[1:53:23] to end until the last one get in
[1:53:29] if he's a child of this little boy here
[1:53:31] brother we're gonna wait until that
[1:53:32] child of this little boy came to life
[1:53:42] by staying together in prayer

[1:58:16] yourself in the promises of god

[2:07:23] praise the lord
[2:07:34] in the god of this evil age i just want
[2:07:36] to read a quote here to you
[2:07:39] just around what our brother spoke about
[2:07:42] tonight
[2:07:44] and
[2:07:50] just as the seed of the church fell back
[2:07:54] there
[2:07:55] with the signs wonder
[2:07:58] and the living christ among them
[2:08:03] it ends up in the last day
[2:08:07] honor the ministry of malachi 4
[2:08:11] to restore back again
[2:08:14] the original faith
[2:08:17] that was once given
[2:08:20] praise the lord i read that again
[2:08:24] just as the seed
[2:08:26] of the church fell back then with signs
[2:08:29] and wonder
[2:08:30] and the living christ among them
[2:08:33] it ends up in the last days under the
[2:08:35] ministry of malachi 4
[2:08:37] to restore back again the origin of
[2:08:39] faith that was once giving
[2:08:43] and then we'll read the next one he says
[2:08:47] he followed that up with this we find
[2:08:50] now
[2:08:52] this evil age
[2:08:55] is to prove to satan
[2:08:59] she is not like eve
[2:09:03] that this bride
[2:09:04] is not like eve
[2:09:07] now so you see it's it's a reverse
[2:09:10] amen
[2:09:12] he went into god's eating
[2:09:15] and he deceived the first eve
[2:09:20] now god has come to his eating
[2:09:24] to be able to raise up a church
[2:09:28] praise the lord
[2:09:29] in the midst of his eating with all the
[2:09:32] deception all the lies and and and all
[2:09:36] the immorality god is raising up an eve
[2:09:40] [Music]
[2:09:43] and he's going to use this loves this
[2:09:46] brine
[2:09:47] now you have to remember you having one
[2:09:50] purpose in this eating
[2:09:52] and the purpose
[2:09:54] god is going to use you to prove to
[2:09:57] satan
[2:09:59] amen
[2:10:01] that if he did not allow it the first
[2:10:03] eve would not be deceived
[2:10:07] so there is just no possibility
[2:10:11] that this eve is going to be deceived
[2:10:14] because god is raising
[2:10:17] her up in this inch
[2:10:20] praise the lord
[2:10:24] we find now this evil age
[2:10:28] is to prove to satan
[2:10:31] praise the lord
[2:10:32] now you see
[2:10:35] god make the age so evil and it's going
[2:10:38] to be worse and it will get

[2:11:01] that she is not like that type of woman
[2:11:05] and she will be tried by his word
[2:11:10] the bride as adam bryan was tried by the
[2:11:13] word and adam bryant believed every bit
[2:11:16] of the word all but
[2:11:20] confused on one promise
