brother ariel amen and we just thank the lord for all of his children praise the lord amen amen what almighty god we self we just we just want to thank the lord amen praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord tonight i'm kind of for changing what i thought i will talk on tonight and just we just take something a little year then uh just remind ourselves on some of the few things we were talking about in john chapter 14. let's go to saint john chapter 14 and praise the lord it's in john chapter 14 actually i want to take uh verse 20. but uh let's read verse 18 uh to verse 20 verse 18. i will not leave you comfortless i will come unto you yet a little while and the words series mean no more but yeah see me because i live ye shall live also at that day yes i know that i am in the father and yea in me and i in you amen revelation chapter 3 revelation chapter 3 praise the lord amen this face sorry i just i just threw a coat back there uh i it's actually my note on a different subject just threw of back there but i will point out the few quotes that i will use tonight praise the lord revelation chapter three uh let's look at verse 20 also revelation chapter 3 verse 20. praise the lord revelation chapter 3 verse 20. behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will so with him and he with me now pause for the wine and just think about this jesus said yeah this is jesus speaking in both places in that day at that day you will know that i am in the father ye in me and i in you bring it to revelation chapter 3 verse 20. i'm standing at the door and if i'm not if you open the door i will come in i will sup with you and you with me it's pretty much the same language i in you you with me suck with you you with me let's pray together heavenly father lord we will just ask your blessing upon your word tonight and father lord and i pray that the holy spirit will be able to take your internal thoughts and feed our souls tonight because lord this is the thing that would give us overcoming power this is the thing lord jesus that will give us the deliverance that we are looking for from this world and from the life of sin lord god is not lord jesus our strength not by power never mind but father is the revelation of your word if there is the understanding of your word oh god i pray tonight that you will just help us lord with a little thought that is before us in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you can have your seed praise the lord you know things happen and then approach you sometimes you get nervous and you you re you try to react to it and sometimes you don't you don't have your your best uh it does not bring your best out of you praise the lord and sometimes it's like that with with uh with preaching and with the ministry you know uh sometimes the devil tried to frustrate you and you really want to get on him or sometimes you see he's trying to trouble the people then you you really want to take him into the fight and sometimes you just you just kind of uh you know so i was i was actually thinking about something i thought i said wednesday night okay i'm going to be i'm going to be like an evangelist i i mean i just need i need to drive this thing down i need to i just need to become a little bit but then as i was praying you know the lord starts to help me to understand you know it's not what we do or what we think we want to do praise the lord the the overcoming power is in the revelation of jesus christ praise the lord the more god can help us to start knowing uh uh who he is and what he wants us to be the easy we will that's that's the thing you know like like brother branham says uh the the the messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 will do two things according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the father to the children that's what that ministry would do it will bring us back to the bible it will make the bible real to us and the ministry of revelation 10 will now reveal in one sense the ministry of revelation 10 will identify us it will be able to point to us just like the angel was doing to john in revelation chapter 6 come and see that's what malachi 4 will do come and see and the the the ministry of revelation 10 you know will reveal the mysteries of god and he said is the revealing of the mysteries of god that we literally you know that will literally so the more that god starts to show himself to us and we start to understand what he's doing in our day what he's doing in our life praise the lord that's the thing that that literally turned us back that's the thing that that that make us to appreciate him more and in appreciating him more we we find no reason for us to stick with this word and that's and and and that is the thing that uh you know i've i've been trying you know trying to to say trying to find the right word you know especially for our young people if we can appreciate what god has given to us the privilege that he has given to us to be able to see what he's doing in this day we will have no reason to lost after this word we'll have no reason to crave this word ghost because i'm telling you it's on fire it's on fire with all of the things that is happening the science is all around us jesus said now one stone will be left upon another now that is not to scare you that your house is going to burn that's not what i'm saying praise the lord i'm saying that an hour with all of these things happening we can we can live for our hands and say lord thank you that i know you as my lord and savior thank you that i haven't i have a relationship yes now even if this afflict tabernacle be dissolved i know in the twinkling of an eye i will step into another one whatever this world will take away from me just just like i'm saying i believe i believe they are there there they are good people they are christians that are lost in their home in california in oregon and all of these places i believe they are there they are people that love god praise the lord but it when when there if that inner hope is there when all you have is gone before your eyes you can be able to say like joke naked i came but naked i will not return amen we have a better language than job we're not going by naked we're going with character we will be dressed in his character praise the lord when everything we have is taken away from us there is something that is real that is the thing that we want to get a hold of hallelujah that's the thing we want to get a hold of because that is the only thing that satisfied praise the lord that is the only thing that's satisfying praise the lord amen so i kind of changed my talk tonight i was actually going to speak on uh the family name the family name brings about family resemblance that's what i was going to talk about tonight but i just i just uh i just thought and say well let me let me now let me just stay with this and uh and trust you know uh praise the lord so i will use i will use their crisis mystery of god reveal called tonight and but but this is this is what i was trying to show you jesus said at that day at that day you will know i am in the father at that day you will know that i'm in the father ye in me and i in you now brother branham says this saying that christ is the mystery of god revealed he said jesus said at that day that's this day now that is what is identified in revelation 3 20 the day that he's standing before the door and knocking because he using the very same language i in you you in me i will stop with you and you will stop with me he's using the very same language so the fulfillment of sin john 14 20 is revelation 3 20. revelation 3 20 literally fulfilled barbara says jesus said at that day there's this day at that day when this revelation is made known you will know that i am in the father the father in me are in you and you in me when the revelation is may manifest at that day yes i know that i and the father are one i am in the father the father is in me then when the revelation comes forth then aids are in you and you aiming there you are see the the threefold manifestation that's what he saw the the manifold the threefold for what to bring it back we have got to be praise the lord so we were talking on this revelation of jesus christ uh uh revelation chapter one revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him now see another think that brother branham express you and uh i hope i can be able to get it now i kind of a flip over here are we together amen he says here in the identification 1964 identification 1964 okay let me let's let's look at this and the character of god was christ he was the reflection god he was god made visible notice god made visible in the beginning was god he wasn't even guarding no one god an object of worship praise the lord he said yeah one thing he was was the antenna and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts praise the lord and those thoughts was expressed to worse the word was made manifest what is it it's all god becoming tangible praise the lord is all god becoming tangible glory be to god and uh let's let's take this also uh sister faith sorry we will see jesus he says this i think uh this is what i wanted to to get to this just the display now it shows what's being done like god becoming god when when he created angers he become a son when he created christ jesus he become a savior when jesus died he become a healer when he was wounded for our transgression and with his tribes we are healed praise the lord [Music] amen crisis identify the same 1964 see me kind of for being a bit slow tonight i'm i'm kind of missing my mind taught in something here so but that's okay this is what i want to share with you tonight christ is identifying the same 1964 and then he is in tanner and in him was attributes and he spoke it and it was a word and the word may manifest and as the word was manifest is god becoming material now you just think about that god becoming that is the thought that is on my mind to think of god becoming just the thought to know that is god he says god becoming tangible god becoming material now we think of him being a creator but revelation says the beginning of the creation of god so god himself becomes his creation so it's not him creating something it's not like a capital making a cheer he goes and cut a wood and make a cheer no is god becoming his creation that's the reason why everything that he created he's represented in it that is the greatness of the godhead god becoming praise the lord it was not that god wanted to have a family god was becoming a family it's not that he want to have a family it's not that god wants to have a bride god is becoming his bride he's becoming and you and myself we the bride of jesus christ in this age the bride of jesus christ in this age we are at that father in of the of of pouring out that last material in god are we together praise the lord just like i said last last wednesday i mean i'm trying to bring this stuff so so we can we can be able to to see it and understand because those are the things that give us strength that give us overcoming power it's now we forcing ourself it's god pulling you redeeming you out of the world because he has choosing you as a vessel to become he want to become a son of god he want to become a daughter of god he want to be a young man in this age that is standing for truth that would not now will not blame into the culture he want to be a young woman that is the reality it's not god saving you because you are a sinner praise the lord amen all things were made by him and for him and for him a savior was for him because in him he had an attribute a savior is not for you that's the reason why if i mean if you if you if you if you downplay the savior god does not feedback worshiping god is not is i mean you're not doing god a favor are we together god becoming he becoming material that's the reason why he can identify himself as the son of righteousness he can identify himself as the tree of life he can identify himself as the river of living waters amen the river of living waters identified himself as a great eagle the bible says he came down his spirit in the form of a dove humble himself assalam god becoming praise the lord god becoming think about it this way that night when joseph took mary down to bethlehem and they were looking for a room they were looking for a room for god to be birthed think about it if the people knew if they knew that that was god that was going to become a baby they would have given the best they would have given their room it would have been them it would have been a clash no just in my room having a king bed i just bought my bed yesterday but they didn't know that god was becoming the baby there was no room praise the lord and here is in this very age god has come in the form of his word to find a people that he can become and you and myself have this privilege and you want to play with it and just play church and just play church that is the thing that will humble us that we humble us that god will look at all the the the the the wealthy people and all the the i mean wonderful people people whose whose parents i mean they just had a good life children that were born in holy warlord and all of that god will look at all of those wonderful people but he will come down and take you and myself that when we look down in our family history sometimes we feel ashamed of ourself god will choose you he will favor you to become and then you want to play church we want to we want to walk over the thing that the prophets of all saw invasion prophesied about jesus even told his disciples they were longing that it happened in their days but it didn't happen god be coming praise the lord god be coming god want to take your marriage christ and his church he wants to materialize himself in your home in your union when when when the minister married a man and his wife he says the two shall become one amen that's the oneness it does not make them one finger but they are one because there's a there's a there's there's a mystery that is going to be taking place in that union they are going to be learning they are going to be learning to serve god as they save one another that's what brother branham said if you serve your husband you are serving god that's what he said and i only said your husband if you save your wife you are serving god god materializing himself god be coming oh i just couldn't get away from that thought tonight it just for my mind i just couldn't get away from that oh my goodness god be coming to think about it that god the self-existing god the great internal spirit at one time he failed all time he filled all space there was nothing but elohim there was nothing but elohim and then elohim starts to become material the spirit starts to become material and we are the final product the bride is the final product praise the lord amen we are the father brother paul says we are his workmanship that's right amen we are his workmanship he takes the material of himself and he's working on it he's now working on it to to you know to bring something else he's working on it to bring himself oh my goodness me my goodness me god be coming my my my my mind praise the lord amen something brother branham said here and uh it's kind of a loss to thought here somewhere but i will be able to get it praise the lord i'll be able to get it oh my goodness my my my mind super sign he says and another thing the word was made dust flesh god became dust and brown said it when he went to visit abraham where he said he pick up the dust pick up the dust and he picked it and he stepped in it god materializing hallelujah praise the lord that's the reason why when we died and rot in the earth quickening power is in the earth is god becoming dust and god will come back from the dust back to flesh god becoming you see that's the reason why god hate a proud spirit god hit arrogance because he can break himself in his greatness he can break himself he can break himself and reduce himself to dust all he asks of you is humble yourself now he asks of you but him almighty god he can break himself i hope the holy spirit when he wake up to you in in the middle of the night you will just hear that voice god be coming when you stand before the mirror to brush your teeth god be coming that's that's what he's been doing throughout all the ages that's what he's doing he made everything for his pleasure god was missed god's flesh due to manas jehovah the word became human became dust oh my god you love the lord tonight god becoming my my my mind praise the lord oh my yeah there's there's there's something that brother brandon plays in this talking and uh i can see i think maybe i added it to the to my notes i wanted to use tonight so i just got got in and throw this one there over to super sign he said god in flesh oh it will be struck into the word jehovah god becoming one of us changing his cast from the great immortal jehovah to become a little infant baby that's the thing that blows the mind of the people that's the thing that blows the mind of the people the reason why other religions struggle over jesus being the son of god is because when they think about son all that comes to their mind is just filthiness that's what they think about son i was talking with a muslim before and i was and and we were talking on that subject he says well god is not a man to have a son i says well that's not what the bible says it was something that god brought out of himself and the moment you see that it makes more sense but my emphasis tonight is right on this thought jesus said at that day you will know that i'm in the father the father in me i in you and you in me how can you how can you how can you break that down praise the lord how can you break that into three how can you how can you separate it it's such a mix and that's the reason why in revelation chapter 3 instead of saying i in you and you in me he said i will stop with you and you will suff with me amen in one sense i will be feeding off your life just as you are feeding of the word of god god is feeding off our life that's what brother branham says he said we we will be bred on the master's table he's getting our life backing us by the word of god so we can be bred on the master's table as we are feeding on the word god want to be feeding off your life that's the son of god that's that's my son that's my daughter feeding off of us i will sup with you and you with me and all of this is what god is doing in our age that this is the reason why he sent a prophet this is the reason why he sent a son of man ministry is not to make doctrines and and and fight with this cult and that cult is god materializing himself in a people we can take our hurts and our differences to the word of god and we know that it's god materializing materializing himself in us putting us on the wheel and breaking us down and spinning our life just like the goldsmith will we'll put the gold in the fire he will put us through trials because it's god becoming is god becoming is god becoming amen god becoming god will be coming sister be real god will be coming but won't god be coming better scared god becoming that's why he told david i'll give you a name he says i will give you a name you know what what he did he never changed the name that david parents gave him but he came behind that name he came behind the name that david father gave him he didn't say i gave you a name and said david not your name no more david he says i will give you a name and he comes behind that name god be coming he comes behind the name that your parents gave you he comes behind that name oh my goodness maybe sonny if the lord help us we talk on nim being a choice god becoming tangible god becoming flesh praise the lord just like i said from the womb to the grave no excuse no excuse from the womb to the grave god became a baby in the womb my parents says oh my child smile they don't know what they are doing they are small god became a baby in a womb he took samuel at at a young age maybe 88 from about three years old when the last starts to talk god starts to deal with him god was becoming the prophet make excuses and allow the devil because when you give the devil those excuses my child is just a small child and okay the devil said okay the bible says foolishness it's in the child until they are safe foolishness is in them i don't care whether they're born from the prophet or from the pastor or whoever bound them foolishness is birth and it takes the road of correction the word of god to beat that foolishness out because god is becoming praise the lord we can go ahead and just go and and going oh my goodness me automatic goal itself amen automatic goal itself you read some of these things they just they just they just humble you they just humble you they just humble you because because you you you don't want it to just it for it to just remain ahead knowledge like paul says i don't want to preach and be cast away i want this word to be flesh me i want the word to become me not just to preach oh that was a great great cemetery it's not we have passed the days of great salmon we are in the days where brother branham said leave me as simon because god want to become the word on two feet leave me a song then sing me a special yes father thank you god becoming oh you young people running to sing special you better obey your mommy at home because sunday morning we all are angers i want to put up our wings and start flying god be coming from the womb to the grave no excuse it's almost nine o'clock musicians you can come for tonight sunday after the service i like to talk to the young people so we stay a little bit after the service i'm telling you church if we miss this we miss the whole purpose while we are here we miss the whole purpose you
