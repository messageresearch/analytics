[15:22] many many many of the Saints will just

[15:42] of things might have gone into the enemy

[19:20] said and we would just want to go right
[19:22] to the world praise the Lord and just
[19:29] like I said on Sunday Monday morning
[19:34] around 3:00 a.m.
[19:36] hello
[19:39] it was almost around 1 a.m. when I got a
[19:42] text from those brothers in South Africa
[19:45] so I had to speak for them only a
[19:50] morning service and the area came over
[19:54] to the house and to help me set up the
[19:57] computer and out of there so we had a
[20:01] little time of fellowship area then
[20:05] Eunice and Becky with my congregation
[20:09] praise the Lord but the reason why I
[20:12] said there is because I spoke on the
[20:16] subject there are morning the seller of
[20:20] or have spoken on namely church before
[20:23] but as so when waiting and I was
[20:27] thinking about it because I was thinking
[20:29] Lord what am I going to preach here this
[20:32] morning and I was I wanted to speak on
[20:36] something about Mary the matter for some
[20:40] reason I just said well let me just talk
[20:43] on something and just to be able to
[20:47] encourage the scene so tonight I want to
[20:49] go back to that subject the seller of
[20:52] all because there's a parallel year in
[20:55] the scripture
[20:56] and there is also a fulfillment of
[20:59] prophecy that I saw after so let's just
[21:03] read second King chapter 4 we from 2nd
[21:09] Kings chapter 4 2nd Kings chapter 4
[21:16] would take this as a type on Elijah's
[21:21] ministry second Kings chapter 4 now
[21:37] second Kings chapter 4 we will read here
[21:40] from from verse 1 now they acquire a
[21:47] certain woman of the wives of the sons
[21:51] of the prophet unto Elisha saying that 7
[21:56] my husband is dead and I'd know it that
[22:01] that 7 they fear the Lord and the
[22:06] creditor has come to take unto him my
[22:11] two sons as a bound man and Elisha said
[22:15] unto her her what shall I do for the
[22:19] tell me what have they in the house and
[22:25] she said the helmet have not anything in
[22:29] the house served a pot of oil then he
[22:36] said God borrow the vessels abroad of
[22:40] all the neighbors even empty vessel
[22:45] borrow not a few and when there I come
[22:51] in Dasha shut the door upon thee and
[22:56] upon the songs and shall pour out into
[23:01] all those vessels and thou shalt set
[23:06] aside that which is 4
[23:09] so she went from him and shut the door
[23:13] upon her and upon Hassan's
[23:16] who brought the vessels to her and she
[23:21] pull out and it came to pass when the
[23:27] vessels were falled that she said unto
[23:30] her son bring me yet a vessel and he
[23:35] said unto her there is net a decimal and
[23:38] the Oersted then she came and told the
[23:44] man of God and he said go sell the oil
[23:49] and pay that debt and left Dow and that
[23:55] children of the rest let's pray together
[23:59] father in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[24:02] want to thank you tonight we just actual
[24:05] God that you come now father and break
[24:08] the bread of life to us O God and bless
[24:10] the thought we have on our heart tonight
[24:12] for speaking Lord hearing and
[24:14] understanding Lord God we just commit
[24:17] ourself in your hands now in Jesus name
[24:19] Amen praise the Lord Allah bless you you
[24:22] may have your seat Matthew chapter 25
[24:27] Matthew chapter 25 when we try to look
[24:34] at some few scriptures together tonight
[24:36] Matthew chapter 25 now Matthew chapter
[24:39] 25 open with behold the bridegroom
[24:44] cometh in Matthew chapter 25 we know
[24:53] there jesus likening the the kiddin of
[24:59] heaven year to these ten virgins and we
[25:05] know the stories for but let's drop down
[25:07] here where it gets interesting verse 6
[25:12] and at midnight there came a a cry made
[25:17] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[25:21] to
[25:22] him then all those virgins arose and
[25:27] trimmed their lamps and the foolish said
[25:31] unto the wise give us of your oil for
[25:37] our lamps are gone out it once burned in
[25:42] the age of looter it burned in the age
[25:45] of Wesley a burn in the Pentecostal age
[25:48] but it went off but the wise answered
[25:54] saying not so lest there be not enough
[26:00] for us in you but go ye rather to them
[26:06] that sell and buy for yourself
[26:13] Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter
[26:19] 3
[26:30] because I spoke on this before seller of
[26:34] also have kind of a titled is a path
[26:38] through to wait if that's okay
[26:42] I don't know if I think maybe Revelation
[26:48] chapter 3 let's look at verse 18
[26:59] Revelation chapter 3 verse 8 in Jesus
[27:02] speaking to the laude church age he said
[27:06] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[27:11] in the fire praise the Lord
[27:14] now where I want to I want to I want to
[27:17] grab our attention tonight I counsel
[27:20] thee to buy of me now he's standing in
[27:24] the loudest church age he was the one
[27:27] knocking at door behold I stand at the
[27:29] door and not and then he rebuked the
[27:33] edge for lukewarmness and blindness and
[27:38] being naked but yet he says I counsel
[27:44] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[27:47] that thou may be rich and white raiment
[27:51] that thou may be clothed and that the
[27:57] shame the shame of thy nakedness do not
[28:00] appear and annoyed that than eyes with a
[28:05] seal that thou mayor see so we see he's
[28:10] standing in the loudest church age and
[28:13] then revelry amis Matthew chapter 25
[28:18] behold the bridegroom cometh is
[28:21] fulfilled in Revelation chapter 3 where
[28:26] he stands at the door and knock
[28:29] praise Lord so in a very same time where
[28:34] Matthew chapter 25 is being fulfilled
[28:38] now we hear in the wise virgin in that
[28:42] that should be representing the bride in
[28:45] saying go to them that sell all and he
[28:49] that is standing in that age is saying
[28:52] buy of me so we want to speak tonight
[28:56] about the seller of oil he's saying bad
[29:01] of me the wise virgin is saying go to
[29:05] him that self and he's saying why of me
[29:10] praise the Lord
[29:12] so there's a seller of oil in our age
[29:16] Isaiah chapter 51 55 sorry as I have 55
[29:26] as I have 55 let's look at verse 1 Oh
[29:34] everyone that tested come here to the
[29:38] water and he that have no money come
[29:43] here buy and eat come buy wine and milk
[29:49] without money and without price praise
[29:55] the Lord
[29:55] as I said with our money and with our
[29:59] price and Jesus over in Matthew chapter
[30:02] 10 says freely receive freely gave
[30:07] praise the Lord
[30:09] so this whole business tonight I would
[30:13] come in to make praise the Lord this
[30:17] business come to talk about a business
[30:21] here but we realized that it's it's a
[30:23] business that we freely receive and we
[30:25] freely give with our money with our
[30:27] price but yet there is a seller of or
[30:30] that is in the Kami men praise the Lord
[30:35] amen
[30:37] so what actually got my attention was to
[30:43] see that right in the loudest church age
[30:47] the Son of Man ministry is standing up
[30:50] and saying I counsel thee to buy of me
[30:53] and the hours worth
[30:55] magic that was the fulfillment of
[30:58] Matthew chapter 25 because verbatim said
[31:00] in a sixth seal he said Matthew chapter
[31:03] 24 was the first seal to the sixth seal
[31:07] and because the seventh seal was silent
[31:11] that was the coming of the Lord which of
[31:14] course is Matthew chapter 25 behold the
[31:18] bridegroom cometh praise the Lord
[31:21] so right in that edge were the
[31:24] bridegroom cometh we see there is a wise
[31:28] virgin we see the foolish virgin and
[31:31] then we see the wise virgin she's the
[31:34] one a possessor of oil and she's having
[31:38] her lamb trimming and growing to meet
[31:42] the the bridegroom and then the foolish
[31:47] virgin she don't have or she run out of
[31:50] oil and she's asking now brother Branham
[31:52] says something yeah that I really make
[31:56] that I really got my attention on this
[31:59] on this subject
[32:11] now in Revelation chapter 4 message he
[32:15] preached revelation chapter 4 1961 he
[32:18] says look at the sleeping virgin look
[32:23] what is his look at a sleeping virgin
[32:29] all what she what she did do she had to
[32:33] sell something in order to buy her own
[32:38] what did she have to sell
[32:41] she had her old crease and all
[32:44] denominational denomination and things
[32:47] she saw out all she had in order to find
[32:51] Christ now so he's saying that she had
[32:54] to sell now as I was looking at this
[32:56] subject there were many things that were
[32:58] going through my mind so let's just go
[33:00] through some scriptures then we can be
[33:02] able to come back to our top praise the
[33:05] Lord and that Genesis chapter 25 Genesis
[33:10] 25 year in Genesis 25 Genesis 25 year or
[33:28] bringing us to the place of easel and
[33:32] Jacob verse 27 say and the boys grood
[33:35] I'm going to drop them the boys grew up
[33:38] and verse 29 and Jacob salt pottage and
[33:46] ISA came from the field and he was faint
[33:51] and Esau said to Jacob feel me I pray
[33:54] thee wave with that same rare party for
[33:59] I am faint therefore was his name called
[34:03] Edom and Jacob said said sell me this
[34:09] day their birthright
[34:12] praise the Lord so we see another
[34:15] selling year I took this to be able to
[34:19] for us to see that the selling year
[34:24] was net more innocence it was it was
[34:28] just like like like making a trade like
[34:34] the battle system you know you have to
[34:37] give something you know to be able to
[34:40] receive something praise the Lord
[34:43] so either was telling or Jacob was
[34:46] telling either a year to be to sell his
[34:49] birthright which mean give me in the
[34:52] breath ride and then I will give you you
[34:56] know the part is for you to eat so we
[35:01] see another type also there in Luke in
[35:08] Luke chapter two off Jesus speak about a
[35:11] young rich ruler and when he talks about
[35:15] a young rich ruler he he said Luke
[35:19] chapter twelve territory he said sell
[35:22] all the half you know and and give arms
[35:27] to the pole you know when so the the
[35:31] same thought go in that line you know
[35:34] Jesus was now literally telling him to
[35:36] go and sell his house and sell
[35:38] everything that he has but he was
[35:41] looking at his desire you know what what
[35:44] was taking the most interest in his life
[35:47] you know what was taking you know is his
[35:52] most focus you know so yes that's what
[35:55] we want to look at tonight you know
[35:57] because when I was talking on this Sun
[35:59] on on Wednesday morning I was trying to
[36:02] bring all of this out you know because
[36:04] we are living in such an age word the
[36:08] gospel you know people have turned it
[36:10] into money-making thing now you're
[36:13] preaching a message on kinsella of art
[36:16] this is all my goodness what this other
[36:18] preacher is coming out way but I wanted
[36:20] to show actually year there in this age
[36:24] in this age and at this time were we are
[36:28] lifting up our head because our
[36:31] redemption is drawing nine this is time
[36:34] where we need to get into into this
[36:36] business
[36:37] amen
[36:38] that's what I want to talk about a
[36:39] little bit yeah we need to get into this
[36:41] business because we realized from from
[36:44] 2nd Kings chapter 4 this woman here I
[36:48] mean she she had a need her two young
[36:51] sons were going to be slaved they were
[36:54] going to be bound man you know the word
[36:56] was going to take them the influence of
[36:59] the word they were going to labor on a
[37:01] sin on a drugs in yeah I mean also
[37:03] something she had to do something so she
[37:06] went to me the Prophet praise the Lord
[37:09] Amen and we know they all represent the
[37:12] Holy Ghost so praise the Lord that's
[37:15] what we want to talk about a little bit
[37:17] I've been trying to do it on their sin
[37:19] you know and and my whole inspiration
[37:23] year the administrate of Jesus Christ in
[37:27] our age you know they have exposed us to
[37:30] the literal life of Jesus Christ
[37:32] yes expose us not to agreed not to a
[37:36] Dogma Netto a group that says were
[37:39] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[37:41] the Holy Ghost and people can speak in
[37:43] tongues and live wrong but this is the
[37:46] literal life of Jesus Christ praise the
[37:49] Lord
[37:50] and with this experience it brings us to
[37:53] the place you know where where the you
[37:56] know the scripture also there's another
[37:58] scripture I would take up yet a little
[38:00] bit but it's at a place word you know
[38:04] Berta Brennan says this this this Holy
[38:06] Ghost is just like the oil and the wine
[38:09] you know he says the more you drink up
[38:13] there the more you want it and each day
[38:15] we can get a fresh baptism of the Holy
[38:17] Ghost praise the Lord so that's what we
[38:19] want to talk about a little bit here
[38:21] trusting that the Lord will he will be
[38:25] able to help us praise the Lord
[38:26] let's look at some few things that that
[38:35] birdbrain said amen
[38:49] okay I think I'm kind of repeating on my
[38:53] nose somewhere yeah see bunch of that
[38:56] repeating I don't know how I did there
[38:59] but I'll be able to praise the Lord you
[39:03] mean okay so we realized that over in
[39:10] Revelation chapter 6 the scripture also
[39:14] talked about you know we getting down to
[39:18] the age were the the Holy Spirit call
[39:22] out and says the the oil in a wine
[39:26] should not be hurt
[39:28] that's Revelation chapter 6 verse 6 now
[39:31] Berta Branham says something on it he
[39:34] says all and wine in the Bible it's
[39:38] associated together always I got the
[39:44] concordance and look and there's a
[39:47] string of them like that we're all and
[39:50] wine goes together now you will also see
[39:53] that when Jesus talked about the parable
[39:59] of the Good Samaritan you know when he
[40:02] spoke about the parable of the Good
[40:04] Samaritan and he took the man over to
[40:06] the end that I mean well whatever he
[40:10] left with the man to take care of that
[40:13] wounded man he needed to buy or and wine
[40:17] to be able to take care of him though so
[40:18] some of the the parallel that Jesus I
[40:22] mean the Bourbon was looking at you
[40:24] through the scripture he says when when
[40:28] the truth of the promised Word of God
[40:31] has been truly reveal to his sins
[40:36] they're filled with all they all get
[40:41] stimulated wine is a stimulation glory I
[40:48] feel it right now stimulated with joy
[40:51] child seed when when it does it has the
[40:56] same effect upon him that wine does upon
[41:03] has the same effect that one does upon a
[41:05] natural man because when the revelation
[41:09] has been given off it of a truth of God
[41:13] and the true believers fill with all and
[41:17] the revelation is revealed that
[41:20] stimulation becomes so great that he he
[41:25] it makes him behave himself on normally
[41:31] praise the Lord now so looking at the
[41:38] the the wine the oil and the wine and
[41:42] also comparing a year with I was softly
[41:45] that we want to talk about I also put in
[41:48] another coat here you know
[41:50] okay that's also speak about the young
[41:53] rich ruler investment verbatim says now
[41:57] someone said now long ago as I told you
[42:02] he said you being a preacher
[42:05] why are you around with them businessmen
[42:08] he says I told them I was a surance
[42:14] ailment of internal life now because I
[42:18] had to use this code because there is
[42:21] many places where brother branham use
[42:24] the code over and over he says I'm not
[42:26] assuming but when he used the code I'm
[42:29] not a sale man he says we don't sell
[42:32] books and tapes you know and then
[42:35] talking about seller of art and
[42:38] realizing there that ministry right
[42:41] there in Revelation chapter three was a
[42:43] ministry that was going to be fulfilled
[42:45] honor the son of man ministry I wanted
[42:48] to be very clear that when I bring out
[42:52] this wholesale may think that you know
[42:55] the other coats were net will not clash
[42:58] with this one so yeah brother Branham
[43:00] says he's a sale man of internal life
[43:02] praise the Lord
[43:04] he says so Darius he says and and that's
[43:08] what Jesus was trying this young man has
[43:11] seemed something in him now that was
[43:14] different now you watch this
[43:16] he says this young man a young rich
[43:18] ruler saw something in Jesus that was
[43:21] different
[43:22] and he know he had internal life you
[43:25] know Jesus high internal life so instead
[43:28] of going to his rubber he he he come
[43:32] toward the person that has that he has
[43:36] seen exactly God ven aqui they would
[43:39] praise the Lord
[43:40] so you see that's why I want to drive
[43:42] drive to tonight with this seller of
[43:44] corn because we realized that this the
[43:50] wise virgin she higher art praise the
[43:53] Lord and if she higher all she new world
[43:55] is where she got it from praise the Lord
[43:57] she had an experience with God she knew
[43:59] where she got it from just like that
[44:01] little girl that went down to to Syria
[44:04] carry down there as a slave but she had
[44:08] a trooper spear and she know there was a
[44:10] prophet in Israel so when Emma felt sick
[44:13] and and and and and and he was striking
[44:16] with leprosy she was not shot to testify
[44:20] that there is a prophet in Israel and if
[44:23] my law can go down there he will get he
[44:26] why because she had an experience praise
[44:29] the Lord Amen and you see that is the
[44:32] thing with cell names you know cell man
[44:35] they always talk about their their
[44:37] product praise the Lord they always talk
[44:41] about their product and you will realize
[44:43] that people that have experienced the
[44:46] Baptistina of the Holy Ghost they always
[44:48] talk about it Amen when people are
[44:50] suffering from habit they were just dead
[44:53] look I used to struggle with hobby but
[44:55] since I received the holy gold that
[44:57] hobby has gone when somebody is sick you
[44:59] know they can be able to testify that
[45:01] our once was safe and I got pray for and
[45:04] I got healed the reason why we don't
[45:07] testify about these things sometimes we
[45:09] struggle in our mind what do we really
[45:11] have it praise the Lord because if we
[45:16] have it we will sell it freely we
[45:19] received freely we must gain its with
[45:23] our money is with our price praise the
[45:26] Lord the only one that is getting the
[45:28] benefit is the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:33] that's what we want to get to tonight
[45:35] praise the Lord Amen this seller of or
[45:46] realizing that we are in we are in we
[45:49] are in this time under this ministry of
[45:53] behold the bridegroom cometh
[45:55] that's the ministry that we are honor
[45:57] that is what our message is sounding out
[46:00] and that is what our lives should be
[46:03] sounding out we should be living alive
[46:06] that is saying behold the bridegroom
[46:07] cometh I'm not doing this because my
[46:11] bridegroom is coming soon I can be part
[46:14] of the teams of the world because the
[46:16] bridegroom cometh that is our message
[46:18] that is what we are living honor and
[46:20] because those wives version was living
[46:23] honor that expectation that is the
[46:26] reason why they kept all in the alarm
[46:28] the foolish virgin was pushing it off
[46:30] for the future but wise virgin we were
[46:37] expecting him right now even right now
[46:39] as we are speaking praise the Lord Amen
[46:42] they had the alarm trained they were
[46:45] ready amen if you realize then the
[46:57] foolish virgin that went through a night
[46:59] period as the whole world is going
[47:02] through a night period what is happening
[47:04] on the earth is affecting us believers
[47:07] it's affecting us bride just like it's
[47:09] affecting the world we are all going to
[47:12] through a night period but this bride is
[47:15] having oil in her lung ready at any
[47:18] moment if anything should happen if that
[47:21] call should come right now as we are
[47:23] speaking the bride is ready to be out of
[47:26] you praise the Lord
[47:29] what are we talking about what are we
[47:31] tested firing about amen in a message
[47:38] let your light so shine you know that's
[47:40] what brother Branham talks about he
[47:42] talks about the billboard
[47:43] and in that message he also brought it
[47:47] out he says we are not sales men but we
[47:50] are billboards praise the Lord
[47:53] but then you will realize what is built
[47:55] before is also for sales because a Bilbo
[47:59] is publicizing something that is being
[48:02] on special praise the Lord so it's also
[48:08] for sale praise the Lord
[48:14] now in the coat that we just read
[48:16] brother Branham says the foolish virgin
[48:19] she could not get the oil because she
[48:22] was not ready to give up her Creek and I
[48:25] believe that is the reason why in this
[48:27] age people are not getting to the Holy
[48:30] Ghost people are not getting the baptism
[48:33] of the Holy Ghost because there are
[48:35] things that we are cherishing more than
[48:38] cherishing the life of Jesus Christ they
[48:41] have things that we are holding to so
[48:42] dear little things that is bringing us
[48:45] pleasure and pride we esteem it and so
[48:49] much in our life now watch what Paul
[48:52] said what Paul said when he when he
[48:56] talked he spoke about either that is
[49:01] tonight
[49:09] Hebrews chapter 12 let's look at verse
[49:20] 16 Hebrew chapter 12 verse 16 he says
[49:34] least there be any fornicator or profane
[49:37] person as either now wash that a profane
[49:45] person as either who for one morsel of
[49:51] meal sold his birthright now so see how
[49:56] Paul the prophet of the age he took easy
[50:00] action ease or callousness for the Holy
[50:04] Ghost for the breath ride he took it as
[50:06] on cleanliness having no desire to be
[50:11] born again having no desire to receive
[50:14] the Holy Ghost he took that as a no
[50:18] cleanness and in the end in a seminal
[50:23] church elder Branham says he says the
[50:25] same spirit of a spiritual fornication
[50:29] he says is the same spirit of spiritual
[50:32] fornication
[50:35] now an important saying year either as a
[50:41] profane person his mind he did not put
[50:46] no value to the Holy Ghost he was just
[50:48] he was just satisfied to be the first
[50:51] bone that's all he was satisfied yeah I
[50:54] I mean about his age how long he's been
[50:57] serving the Lord has long he'd been in
[51:00] the message-id long you know he'd been
[51:03] reading the tapes he was just satisfied
[51:05] with that in his mind
[51:07] and he was so callous about the Holy
[51:09] Ghost
[51:15] and over in verse 17 Paul also saying
[51:18] for you know how dead after all when he
[51:24] will have inherited the blessing he was
[51:30] rejected because he was profane in his
[51:35] ways to was the things of God he made
[51:44] mock read about it you always find
[51:46] something to laugh about when it comes
[51:49] around the things of God now the time he
[51:55] wanted a blessing he was rejected for he
[52:02] found no place of repentance though he
[52:06] sought it carefully with tears he cried
[52:14] and he cried and he cried he could find
[52:16] no place of repentance he said he sold
[52:23] his breath right praise the Lord
[52:28] where Benin says either he had all all
[52:32] his tricks in his life he was struggling
[52:35] but there was one thing that he wanted
[52:37] he wanted the breath right because he
[52:41] nor with that breath right he would get
[52:43] the blessing and he will overcome so no
[52:46] matter what I mean young people you're
[52:48] going through your mind bite or peer
[52:50] pressure and everything get to the
[52:52] breath right get to the Holy Ghost get
[52:57] the Holy Ghost sell this word for the
[53:00] Holy Ghost praise the Lord I mean the
[53:03] price of this word is not enough to to
[53:07] pay for the Holy Ghost but if you give
[53:09] the word or go as they give you the Holy
[53:10] Ghost praise the Lord he would take your
[53:12] price amen a seller of oil that's what
[53:20] I'm talking about tonight but balance is
[53:22] prefaced reign peffer weakness he said
[53:25] one

[54:19] give my child a Holy Ghost law get a

[1:29:35] preach long in Colinas house I mean all
[1:29:39] the long preaching is because the
[1:29:41] preacher keep running after spirit year
[1:29:43] he keep running after the instructor
[1:29:45] mind in this day when the people had
[1:29:47] prayed of the people our honor
[1:29:49] expectation is just an atmosphere God's
[1:29:53] come down and the service ends that's
