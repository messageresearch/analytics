[59:03] may the Lord just just have his way and
[59:06] help us this morning let's go to the
[59:09] Book of Genesis chapter 28 38 not 28 38
[59:13] 38. last week we were talking about the
[59:17] house of parents I will I would like to
[59:19] continue in their Direction but I will
[59:22] speak unborn by the Sea incorruptible
[59:26] Born By the Sea incorruptible
[59:30] that's what Peter said uh
[59:33] back there the
[59:36] so that's that's what I would want us to
[59:39] talk about
[59:41] uh
[59:45] that's that's the subject I will I will
[59:48] give myself this morning but let's just
[59:51] read Genesis chapter 38
[59:53] just for the background that we did do a
[59:56] little review from where we stopped
[1:00:08] you know all the time we have a
[1:00:10] sometimes I go home and I ask myself am
[1:00:14] I I'm not a making it easy for the
[1:00:17] people to understand the direction that
[1:00:19] I'm going
[1:00:20] uh I know many of the time I even
[1:00:24] Leave myself in suspense how much more
[1:00:27] about you amen
[1:00:29] and
[1:00:31] praise the Lord you know the brothers
[1:00:34] who say brother one you always preach
[1:00:36] and you leave people in suspense and
[1:00:38] sometimes it's hard to follow the
[1:00:40] direction that you're going but I pray
[1:00:42] that
[1:00:43] I'm not leaving you in the day I came in
[1:00:46] let's read that Genesis chapter 38
[1:00:49] we read from verse
[1:00:54] 26. you have to remember we started with
[1:00:57] this subject back at the beginning of
[1:00:58] the year when we were talking about
[1:01:00] righteousness
[1:01:01] so let's just read Judah confession here
[1:01:04] and Judah acknowledged him and said she
[1:01:07] has been more righteous than I because
[1:01:10] that I give her that
[1:01:13] to ashila my son and he knew her again
[1:01:17] no more 27 and it came to pass in the
[1:01:21] time of her travel that behold Twins
[1:01:24] were in her womb and it came to pass
[1:01:26] when she traveled that the one pulled
[1:01:30] out his hand and the male wife took and
[1:01:33] bound upon
[1:01:36] uh and and bound upon his hand as
[1:01:39] colored thread saying this came out
[1:01:43] first now you have to remember that
[1:01:45] phrase this came out first because that
[1:01:49] phrase identified your first birth
[1:01:54] that is your first birth
[1:01:59] and uh this came out first
[1:02:02] and it came to pass as he drew back his
[1:02:06] hand that behold his brother came out
[1:02:11] and she said the male wife I would guess
[1:02:14] how have that broken forth how you how
[1:02:18] you overcame
[1:02:19] he was the first
[1:02:23] how did you came out
[1:02:25] praise the Lord
[1:02:32] how have that broken fault this bridge
[1:02:36] that word Bridge
[1:02:39] is is almost like it could mean bridge
[1:02:43] that goes over a lake or you know it
[1:02:47] could also means
[1:02:49] uh a gap something took place
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:54] you you bypass the natural author
[1:02:59] praise the Lord
[1:03:01] and as we go back to uh uh uh uh uh who
[1:03:06] is this Melissa that we can take that
[1:03:08] top that you bypass your teal funny
[1:03:12] for you to come to time to be tempted
[1:03:15] for you to be tested praise the Lord so
[1:03:19] there was a bridge
[1:03:22] that will connect you back to your
[1:03:24] original identification
[1:03:27] praise the Lord
[1:03:28] so what this bridge be upon be
[1:03:32] therefore his name was called fears
[1:03:37] praise the Lord and after war came out
[1:03:40] his brother
[1:03:43] that had this the Scarlet thread upon
[1:03:46] his hand and his name was called zero
[1:03:50] praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you
[1:03:54] you may have your seed while we turn to
[1:03:56] First Peter chapter one where we're
[1:03:59] taking our inspiration from uh this this
[1:04:03] morning
[1:04:05] First Peter chapter one
[1:04:09] that's where we're taking our
[1:04:10] inspiration from this morning
[1:04:30] let's read from Verse 18 for as much
[1:04:34] as you know that year will not redeem
[1:04:37] with corruptible things uh silver and
[1:04:41] gold from your vain conversation
[1:04:46] received by traditions
[1:04:49] from your fathers
[1:04:51] but with the precious blood of Christ
[1:04:54] amen
[1:04:56] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[1:05:00] spot we verily was full ordained before
[1:05:04] the foundation of the word but was
[1:05:07] manifest in this last time for you
[1:05:12] oh by him do believe in God who raise
[1:05:18] him up from the dead and give him glory
[1:05:21] that your Faith and Hope might be in God
[1:05:24] not in a man not in a church amen Your
[1:05:28] Faith and Hope might be in God praise
[1:05:31] the Lord hallelujah
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:35] praise the Lord
[1:05:42] are we together
[1:05:46] trying to find myself to be with you
[1:05:48] seeing ye have purified your souls in
[1:05:52] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:05:55] onto on the frame love of the Brethren
[1:05:58] saying that ye love one another with
[1:06:01] with a pure heart heavenly
[1:06:06] being born again
[1:06:09] not of corruptible seed
[1:06:14] but of incorruptible
[1:06:18] praise the Lord
[1:06:20] so we would we would deal with the sea
[1:06:22] principle every seed must bring forth of
[1:06:26] its kind
[1:06:27] so Peter is saying here our new birth
[1:06:31] when we are born again our new birth our
[1:06:34] second birth
[1:06:36] the one that bypassed zero praise the
[1:06:39] Lord amen
[1:06:43] is not of corruptible seed is of
[1:06:48] Incorruptible see praise the Lord
[1:06:51] and that Incorruptible seed is the word
[1:06:54] of God which liveth and a Barrett
[1:06:57] forever
[1:06:59] praise the Lord
[1:07:01] so we uh for this second phase we want
[1:07:06] to speak on born by the seed
[1:07:11] incorruptible
[1:07:13] praise the Lord now if if we will look
[1:07:17] close here you will see that the uh uh
[1:07:22] we were we were in a book of Ruth
[1:07:25] chapter four let's go back there and
[1:07:27] let's cap up on our review here root
[1:07:30] chapter 4 praise the Lord
[1:07:34] that's where we saw these uh uh this
[1:07:39] tremendous uh
[1:07:42] uh these tremendous prophecy
[1:07:45] about the house of pharaohs amen
[1:07:50] I don't know whether whether you grab it
[1:07:53] or whether I left you uh in suspense
[1:07:57] but what we were talking about here what
[1:08:00] what kind of a meeting uh
[1:08:06] what made it a prophecy here is the
[1:08:10] other
[1:08:15] this is how the uh the the the the
[1:08:19] wedding after the wedding of Ruth and
[1:08:22] Boaz and then uh uh don't don't uh just
[1:08:27] just follow me now uh
[1:08:29] the brother is trying to translate down
[1:08:31] the you know the don't don't say there
[1:08:35] is voices you hear your voices
[1:08:37] okay
[1:08:39] don't say what's going on hearing voices
[1:08:42] just stay with me
[1:08:45] the technician will get that under
[1:08:48] control praise the Lord
[1:08:49] amen now
[1:08:52] so uh
[1:08:56] Ruth and Boaz here but then after
[1:09:00] uh the the Javier chai uh the the the
[1:09:05] Heathers were were testifying and uh
[1:09:16] the Bible says verse 17 of chapter 4 in
[1:09:19] the Book of Ruth and the women her
[1:09:22] neighbors gave a name saying there is a
[1:09:27] son born unto now meaning and they call
[1:09:29] his name Obed
[1:09:31] he is the father of Jesse
[1:09:35] the father of David
[1:09:38] then then right there
[1:09:41] the Bible goes into this
[1:09:44] you know as as as a Christian as a as a
[1:09:50] Bible reader
[1:09:51] uh it must grab your attention now these
[1:09:55] are the generation of pharaohs you know
[1:09:58] what what does that have to do with roof
[1:10:00] and boas
[1:10:02] what what does that have to do with this
[1:10:04] child that is born
[1:10:07] praise the Lord
[1:10:09] amen now so it gave us the generation of
[1:10:14] pharaohs and then it ends on to verse 22
[1:10:17] and Obed beget Jesse and Jesse be gay
[1:10:20] David
[1:10:21] and then if you look at that there it
[1:10:24] gives you 10 Generations
[1:10:26] so then it also sent us back now to the
[1:10:29] book of Deuteronomy that tells us that
[1:10:32] an illegitimate will not enter into the
[1:10:35] congregation until after 10th Generation
[1:10:39] praise the Lord
[1:10:40] because we realize that what happened
[1:10:43] between Judah and his daughter-in-law
[1:10:46] Tema there was an illegitimate Act
[1:10:49] dependent
[1:10:50] so for God to redeem that
[1:10:53] because that was in the sea lion of God
[1:10:58] praise the Lord
[1:11:00] so here we we we're seeing this prophecy
[1:11:03] laying out here and and you know and God
[1:11:06] is uh uh uh grabbing our attention to
[1:11:10] that so God is dealing he's he's
[1:11:13] Redeeming the Sea of Judah
[1:11:17] he's bringing the seed of Judah back
[1:11:21] into the congregation of the Lord why
[1:11:24] because the Bible says that the scepter
[1:11:27] shall not leave Judah which speaks of
[1:11:30] the kingship
[1:11:32] so you see that's the reason why Israel
[1:11:35] could not have a king because the family
[1:11:38] out of who the king was supposed to come
[1:11:41] hard and illegitimate curse over them
[1:11:45] so on turn that curse was breaking until
[1:11:48] the high one that we come back into the
[1:11:51] congregation
[1:11:52] before Israel we have a king
[1:11:57] that's what Meg David a king after God's
[1:12:00] Own Heart because he broke the curse
[1:12:04] are we together
[1:12:07] praise the Lord
[1:12:09] so you see yeah there's there are just
[1:12:12] there's a whole lot of mystery
[1:12:14] concerning your life that you don't know
[1:12:16] about don't think that you figure out
[1:12:18] your life don't deceive yourself
[1:12:21] don't lean onto your own understanding
[1:12:24] because there is a whole cloud of
[1:12:27] mystery around your life that you have
[1:12:29] not break the Earth you have not even
[1:12:31] touched the surface of it
[1:12:38] are we together
[1:12:41] so yeah we see that out of that
[1:12:46] illegitimate ad there were two
[1:12:49] there were two seeds that came out
[1:12:52] there were two sounds that were born
[1:12:55] praise the Lord
[1:12:58] Sarah that was supposed to be the first
[1:13:02] they are the male wife identify as the
[1:13:05] first
[1:13:07] But
[1:13:09] True Divine of image
[1:13:12] perish people
[1:13:15] he overcame Zara
[1:13:18] and he came forth
[1:13:22] praise the Lord
[1:13:24] amen all of that is happening the male
[1:13:26] wives are watching it they are saying oh
[1:13:28] wow what kind of for Naughty Boy is this
[1:13:31] how did you do that
[1:13:33] praise the Lord they are seeing all of
[1:13:36] that but they don't have an idea that
[1:13:39] God
[1:13:41] almighty God
[1:13:43] is writing prophecy
[1:13:48] no idea
[1:13:53] okay that's the house of pharaohs
[1:13:56] this morning
[1:13:58] I want for us to look a little bit into
[1:14:01] the other songs
[1:14:06] praise the Lord you love the Lord are
[1:14:10] you ready for the word
[1:14:12] how I need God to strengthen me this
[1:14:14] morning
[1:14:15] praise the Lord how I lead God to
[1:14:19] strengthen me this morning you see it's
[1:14:21] it's very amazing when you read the
[1:14:23] Bible
[1:14:26] this Bible
[1:14:28] contains
[1:14:30] from the beginning of the creation of
[1:14:33] the word
[1:14:34] you read this Bible you go back and read
[1:14:36] the book of Genesis right in chapter 11
[1:14:40] in chapter 12.
[1:14:42] and and and and you can see word history
[1:14:46] there is not a nation under the Earth
[1:14:49] there might it might have a change of
[1:14:51] name
[1:14:53] praise the Lord
[1:14:55] but it's history is in this book
[1:15:01] there is not a family on the face of the
[1:15:04] Earth
[1:15:05] whose root
[1:15:08] is from somewhere else
[1:15:11] that you cannot Trace back
[1:15:14] to the Bible
[1:15:15] there is not a race of people
[1:15:18] there is not a tribe
[1:15:21] your tribe might have come out of one
[1:15:23] tribe and Miami
[1:15:26] Tribe but if you trace it back
[1:15:30] it will end back right into this book
[1:15:34] praise the Lord
[1:15:37] this is an amazing book
[1:15:41] It's a Wonderful book
[1:15:43] praise the Lord
[1:15:45] Hallelujah
[1:15:48] it's one of the book that is most read
[1:15:51] it's so bad that we're having a
[1:15:53] generation now that don't want to read
[1:15:55] the Bible
[1:15:56] but you will realize that before time
[1:15:59] lawyers
[1:16:01] when people steady law
[1:16:04] they always
[1:16:05] read the Bible
[1:16:08] praise the Lord
[1:16:10] great scientists
[1:16:12] read the Bible
[1:16:16] actors

[1:16:24] there were there were there were just
[1:16:26] something that was that it had a kind of
[1:16:30] for magnetic food
[1:16:34] praise the Lord
[1:16:37] it used to be then you travel around the
[1:16:40] world you get into a hotel check the
[1:16:43] draw you'll find a Bible yeah
[1:16:49] working

[1:17:05] this book
[1:17:13] praise the Lord
[1:17:21] now I I've been we've been reading
[1:17:24] through the Book of Joshua
[1:17:26] Holmen and I've been doing my own Joshua
[1:17:29] steady
[1:17:33] with different things
[1:17:35] I've been looking through and and all of
[1:17:37] that
[1:17:39] uh
[1:17:41] and some some some some very fascinating
[1:17:45] things came out of the Book of Joshua
[1:17:48] for me let's go to Joshua chapter 6.
[1:17:51] Joshua chapter 6
[1:17:53] is the the conquered of Jericho
[1:17:57] but there are some amazing thing in the
[1:18:00] end
[1:18:00] in their book
[1:18:02] uh I was going to read a quote of
[1:18:05] brother Branham here to Startup wave but
[1:18:08] it looks like I didn't I didn't add it
[1:18:11] to my note
[1:18:14] I didn't add it to my note but we we
[1:18:16] will catch up here
[1:18:18] Joshua chapter 6.
[1:18:21] praise the Lord
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:26] Joshua chapter 6. you see that's that's
[1:18:29] one of the things that makes me to stay
[1:18:30] alone I have a very slow stat
[1:18:33] and this guy like you have to push him
[1:18:35] down the road
[1:18:37] you got to keep pushing him get up the
[1:18:39] hill and let him go
[1:18:42] you know
[1:18:43] I'm just like some kind of for all
[1:18:47] vehicle where you gotta push with one
[1:18:49] leg outside and jump in and try to
[1:18:53] face
[1:18:56] but when you get me going I've I've
[1:18:58] tried to get you to your destination
[1:19:03] praise the Lord there is an amazing
[1:19:06] thing here in in Joshua chapter six I
[1:19:09] want for us to study together
[1:19:11] Joshua chapter 6 you see God
[1:19:15] in his law now follow me now
[1:19:21] there are some things that the Lord
[1:19:23] takes unto himself you realize that in
[1:19:27] Egypt
[1:19:29] when God was going to strike Egypt he
[1:19:32] decided to
[1:19:33] to hit Egypt so high
[1:19:37] by the slain of the firstborn
[1:19:42] and when God did that
[1:19:45] it moved Pharaoh it moved the entire
[1:19:47] Egyptians
[1:19:50] but then God turned to the children of
[1:19:53] Israel and said that I did that because
[1:19:59] I want to have the right to your
[1:20:01] firstborn
[1:20:06] from now on all the first born of man
[1:20:08] and obese are mine
[1:20:13] praise the Lord
[1:20:16] and then as time will goes on God will
[1:20:19] now show that how he moved up from
[1:20:23] having the firstborn as heads to have
[1:20:26] the levite as his
[1:20:29] and the Levites will now be you know uh
[1:20:33] uh the people that would Belongs to the
[1:20:35] Lord and in some way they will represent
[1:20:38] the first bomb now it used to be in
[1:20:40] those days that when a man had the
[1:20:43] firstborn son and uh he knew that that
[1:20:46] song was for the Lord so uh uh there was
[1:20:49] something that was that was instituted
[1:20:52] that was called the Redemption money so
[1:20:54] the man would come up with a certain
[1:20:56] Psalm and he would go and give that
[1:20:59] money over to the priests and then you
[1:21:01] know he will have his boy at home but it
[1:21:04] was still in the back of the in their
[1:21:06] mind that you know that uh the the the
[1:21:09] firstborn was the Lord
[1:21:12] now when you come over to Joshua chapter
[1:21:14] six there there are some other things
[1:21:16] lying there but I will I'll get over it
[1:21:18] or else I won't get to what I want to
[1:21:20] talk about
[1:21:21] God approaching
[1:21:25] the promised land he approaching the
[1:21:27] inherent things that he promised to the
[1:21:29] children of Israel he's going to bring
[1:21:33] out a principle that I want us to see
[1:21:36] God is going to use the Conqueror of
[1:21:40] Jericho
[1:21:42] and the way he will approach Jericho
[1:21:46] praise the Lord you can see right there
[1:21:48] from the beginning when those spies went
[1:21:50] into Jericho Rahab testified of how the
[1:21:54] people were were terrified they have
[1:21:57] heard of these people you see so God
[1:22:00] went before Joshua and he created a fear
[1:22:03] in the house of the people of Jericho
[1:22:07] praise the Lord the Lord was the one
[1:22:09] that created that fear
[1:22:12] Israel never had a a military group they
[1:22:16] were they were just they were just
[1:22:17] families they were traveling together
[1:22:20] praise the Lord all the how was the
[1:22:24] shout of the king in the camp
[1:22:27] they had the Ark of the Covenant
[1:22:31] praise the Lord now all they are the
[1:22:34] high God India mess
[1:22:37] the Lord and I'm telling you if you have
[1:22:40] the god of the universe in your Camp you
[1:22:43] are on The Winning Side you are stronger
[1:22:46] than any nightmare in the world
[1:22:50] are we together
[1:22:53] God is going to approach this I want you
[1:22:56] now to put on your your your your your
[1:22:58] spiritual cap and look very closely yeah
[1:23:01] he's going to approach this with with
[1:23:04] with far with such a principle
[1:23:07] because this is the land
[1:23:10] that he promised Abraham I will give you
[1:23:13] this life
[1:23:15] Lord your sea shall sold joy in a
[1:23:19] Strange Land I will bring them out with
[1:23:21] a mighty hand and I will give you this
[1:23:24] Lane
[1:23:25] so what is he going to do God now is
[1:23:29] going to take a tie
[1:23:32] from what he promised to give them
[1:23:36] the principle of tithing oh I get you in
[1:23:39] a in a tight corner here
[1:23:47] praise the Lord
[1:23:50] he's going to approach this in in this
[1:23:53] way that Jericho
[1:23:56] the conquer of Jericho
[1:23:59] he toyed Israel I would give you every
[1:24:02] inch of the ground you have to fight for
[1:24:04] it
[1:24:05] but with the approach of Jericho
[1:24:08] God is going
[1:24:10] not to allow Israel to use their muscles
[1:24:16] they will not fight amen praise the Lord
[1:24:20] he's going to conquer the land by
[1:24:23] himself
[1:24:25] in a supernatural way he's going to
[1:24:28] bring down the Walls
[1:24:30] and he's going to tell them that you
[1:24:33] must burn everything
[1:24:36] this is going to be a burn offering to
[1:24:40] me
[1:24:42] I have given you the lane but this
[1:24:44] portion is going to be a burn offering
[1:24:48] to me
[1:24:52] after this
[1:24:54] when Israel go and Conquer they were to
[1:24:57] this they were to distribute the sports
[1:24:59] whatever they gather
[1:25:01] they were to take it
[1:25:04] praise the Lord but God is going to say
[1:25:06] in Jericho
[1:25:11] not a sheep
[1:25:14] not an arcs
[1:25:16] nothing
[1:25:18] don't take nothing everything Burn It To
[1:25:22] Me
[1:25:25] praise the Lord
[1:25:28] so just by that principle you will
[1:25:30] realize that God
[1:25:32] was taking an offering to himself
[1:25:36] if I'm going to be part of this battle
[1:25:39] I'm going to take Jericho
[1:25:44] which is the first
[1:25:46] that's the principle of tithing people
[1:25:48] the first
[1:25:52] Robert Brown says show me the man that
[1:25:55] will prosper
[1:25:57] or the man that would put God first
[1:26:00] I will show you a man
[1:26:04] prosper
[1:26:06] so God is going to take that first
[1:26:09] Conquest
[1:26:11] but the king true that Jovi oh I love
[1:26:15] this
[1:26:16] I love this
[1:26:18] Hallelujah
[1:26:21] amen
[1:26:22] I love this
[1:26:24] praise the Lord
[1:26:26] Hallelujah
[1:26:28] after they came through the Jordan
[1:26:32] he's going to take this first Conquest
[1:26:35] as his
[1:26:37] now they are set in principle here you
[1:26:39] go home and read the entire chapter but
[1:26:40] let's go let's go quickly here chapter
[1:26:42] one
[1:26:43] now Jericho verse one sorry not chapter
[1:26:46] one chapter six verse one now Jericho
[1:26:50] was strictly shut up because of the
[1:26:52] children of Israel none went out and
[1:26:54] none came in why because the two spies
[1:26:56] has gone
[1:26:58] so the barricade of the entire city
[1:27:00] and the law said unto Joshua seed I have
[1:27:04] given now I will give I have given it's
[1:27:10] already done
[1:27:12] it is already done

[1:27:18] now you're begging that is going to make
[1:27:20] it down it's not your fasting God has
[1:27:24] already given it it's a finish work

[1:27:31] Hallelujah
[1:27:33] Do You Believe In The Finnish work
[1:27:36] amen are we going are we ready to trust
[1:27:39] in the finished work are we going to
[1:27:41] claim the finish work or do we want to
[1:27:44] impress God that we can do it better
[1:27:52] are we together you love the Lord oh
[1:27:56] let's give you in the hand of Praise
[1:27:58] Hallelujah
[1:28:00] thank you Lord thank you for the

[1:28:09] Battle Is Over the victory is won it's
[1:28:13] already done
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:19] it's a finish work
[1:28:21] the law said unto Joshua see I have
[1:28:24] given into I have given into thy hands
[1:28:29] Jericho
[1:28:30] and the Kings thereof and the Mighty Men
[1:28:34] of vellum
[1:28:38] and the Asia come past the city
[1:28:41] all the men of War
[1:28:44] and go around about the city once
[1:28:47] Thou shalt thou do six days
[1:28:51] now verse 4 pay attention to verse 4.
[1:28:55] because it's going to be very very
[1:28:57] important
[1:28:58] praise the Lord
[1:29:00] verse 4
[1:29:03] God
[1:29:05] is going to
[1:29:06] rewrite he's going to break his own Lord
[1:29:11] he's going to break his own principle
[1:29:14] that's the way that's that's that's what
[1:29:16] I love about my God
[1:29:20] praise the Lord
[1:29:21] because he tells you that there is
[1:29:23] nothing above his word
[1:29:25] that even he himself he's not above his
[1:29:28] word
[1:29:29] praise the Lord
[1:29:31] amen but he says I can go around it
[1:29:36] verse 4.
[1:29:38] and
[1:29:41] seven priests
[1:29:43] shall bear before
[1:29:46] that
[1:29:47] now go back go back and and read over
[1:29:52] there uh in the tournament Leviticus it
[1:29:56] was always 12 priests
[1:29:59] that goes before the ark
[1:30:02] 12 priests ish representing a tribe
[1:30:07] but yeah for Jericho the order change
[1:30:10] it's not going to be 12 pricks
[1:30:13] I want seven
[1:30:15] to go before the ark
[1:30:19] are we together
[1:30:21] praise the Lord
[1:30:23] amen
[1:30:25] are we together people
[1:30:29] am I keeping you in suspense
[1:30:33] praise the Lord amen are you sitting and
[1:30:36] saying I wonder where is he going
[1:30:42] and oh yes people get so anxious they
[1:30:45] just want to put their hands in no no
[1:30:47] wait one at a time
[1:30:49] one at a time
[1:30:52] oh we just love the Lord amen
[1:30:55] we love the Lord Seven priests shall
[1:30:58] bear before the ark
[1:31:01] seven trumpets of ram Holmes
[1:31:06] that's completely different Ram horse
[1:31:08] were never used in battle
[1:31:11] it was silver horns that was used in
[1:31:14] battle when you go back to Leviticus
[1:31:17] horns were never used in battle
[1:31:21] Ram Holmes Leviticus chapter 25
[1:31:27] is the Jubilee horn
[1:31:34] praise the Lord
[1:31:35] Leviticus chapter 25 when you read and
[1:31:38] then and then that was the horn that was
[1:31:42] born to announce the Jubilee glory to
[1:31:45] God that now you are free all your
[1:31:48] deaths are paid
[1:31:54] but God is introducing that here in in
[1:31:57] this battle it's completely different
[1:32:11] and the seventh day
[1:32:14] yeah shall come past the city seven
[1:32:17] times
[1:32:21] but either Commandments he says the
[1:32:23] seventh day keep it holy and ye shall do
[1:32:27] no work
[1:32:28] in the seventh day
[1:32:31] even the distance
[1:32:33] that Israel would travel in the seventh
[1:32:36] day was calculated you cannot go above
[1:32:38] certain miles you break the Sabbath
[1:32:43] Year God is going to make them to work
[1:32:47] on the seventh day
[1:33:00] praise the Lord
[1:33:10] are we together
[1:33:13] seven priests shall go before the ark
[1:33:16] with seven Rams Horn
[1:33:21] and then on the seventh day
[1:33:26] they must go around the setting seven
[1:33:29] times that is above the miles that they
[1:33:31] will ever travel on the seventh day
[1:33:34] man God is introducing all of these
[1:33:38] things to show that
[1:33:42] when he introduced the rest
[1:33:46] on the seventh day
[1:33:48] in Genesis chapter 1.
[1:33:51] the Bible says and God rested from all
[1:33:55] of his works
[1:33:58] praise the Lord
[1:34:01] that
[1:34:02] it is not just like in our human natural
[1:34:06] sense what we think about the rest
[1:34:11] well there was something that God was
[1:34:13] introducing
[1:34:16] that's the reason why for the New
[1:34:18] Testament Church the rest has become the
[1:34:20] Holy Ghost
[1:34:23] praise the Lord
[1:34:26] Hallelujah
[1:34:27] amen
[1:34:29] now you have to realize that when God
[1:34:32] gave them the Commandment they were the
[1:34:35] one to rest on the seventh day
[1:34:38] praise the Lord
[1:34:39] so if God is instructing them here to
[1:34:42] work meaning that they are not the one
[1:34:45] working
[1:34:46] by law they are supposed to rest so on
[1:34:49] the seventh day it's going to be
[1:34:51] almighty God that will step in there
[1:34:56] because they were not supposed to rest
[1:34:58] they were not supposed to work they were
[1:35:00] supposed to be resting
[1:35:07] praise the Lord
[1:35:09] hallelujah you see that is the reason
[1:35:11] why the New Testament Church never
[1:35:14] talked to the Sabbath they talked to the
[1:35:16] resurrection
[1:35:18] that's why we meet on Sunday to all of
[1:35:21] the Resurrection because the
[1:35:23] resurrection magnified the Sabbath
[1:35:30] [Music]
[1:35:33] are we together
[1:35:36] now let me say before I go any further
[1:35:39] and we should stay along in church
[1:35:41] please blame yourself
[1:35:46] Hallelujah
[1:35:48] is that a deal
[1:35:50] okay
[1:35:52] okay
[1:35:53] let's just make that as a deal
[1:35:55] so it will not be like the pastor is
[1:35:57] said we kept him there long
[1:36:01] praise the Lord
[1:36:07] but you understanding what I'm saying
[1:36:10] the Sabbath supposed to be our rest
[1:36:15] amen it's supposed to be the arrest
[1:36:19] glory be to God and brother Branham said
[1:36:23] if we have not entered into rest for God
[1:36:26] to take over our work
[1:36:29] we have to enter into rest yes
[1:36:34] yes are we together
[1:36:36] as long as you are working it out
[1:36:39] yourself the father have nothing to do
[1:36:43] you are keeping him in arrest because
[1:36:46] you are doing the work you supposed to
[1:36:49] work sixth day in the seven days
[1:36:53] you step back and let God take it over
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:37:00] are we together
[1:37:02] so if these people
[1:37:04] if God I'm I'm in my mind I'm imagining
[1:37:07] all of these men looking at Joshua what
[1:37:10] is he saying we never use ram horns in
[1:37:14] battle
[1:37:17] Joshua out of his mind
[1:37:21] Joshua I thought it was supposed to be
[1:37:24] 12 minutes before the ACT each man to a
[1:37:27] Travis lever representing uh uh uh uh a
[1:37:31] tribe
[1:37:33] praise the Lord
[1:37:36] I don't think they argue with Joshua but
[1:37:40] in your mind
[1:37:41] just like we do
[1:37:45] you sit there you hear the word and in
[1:37:47] your mind you're calculating
[1:37:52] praise the Lord
[1:37:55] what is he talking about
[1:37:58] Joshua you realize the seventh day is
[1:38:01] the day of rest
[1:38:03] do you realize that
[1:38:08] listening listen to what is God
[1:38:14] praise the Lord
[1:38:15] I'm going to check for the court Moses
[1:38:17] had it and go right into Exodus chapter
[1:38:19] 20. I finally caught
[1:38:25] Joshua was honored Divine instruction
[1:38:31] Joshua was speaking that day just like
[1:38:33] brother Brandon preaching the seals
[1:38:36] praise the Lord the angel met him just
[1:38:39] before he came to the pulpit
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:46] he never had control over it
[1:38:51] praise the Lord
[1:38:54] I believe Joshua went back and listened
[1:38:56] to the table and said what was I
[1:38:57] preaching today
[1:38:58] oh my God
[1:39:02] but he was honored and divine
[1:39:05] Divine structure
[1:39:08] holy spirit amen
[1:39:10] just like we don't like to leave our
[1:39:13] comfort zone
[1:39:14] we get so used to doing things the way
[1:39:17] we faint is right it's righteous in all
[1:39:20] of that
[1:39:26] and you become so uncomfortable
[1:39:29] put on your religious gears
[1:39:34] praise the Lord
[1:39:39] seven priests seven Ramones
[1:39:43] seventh time
[1:39:45] around the city
[1:39:47] praise the Lord
[1:39:51] are we together
[1:39:53] Joshua chapter 6 verse 17.
[1:40:00] Joshua chapter 6 verse 17.
[1:40:04] praise the Lord
[1:40:15] sister Queen are you are we together
[1:40:18] am I boring you
[1:40:20] okay let's do it
[1:40:23] praise the Lord
[1:40:28] are we together
[1:40:32] verse 16 let's read and it came to pass
[1:40:35] after seventh time when the priests
[1:40:38] blowed blew the blue with the trumpet
[1:40:41] Joshua said unto the people shout for
[1:40:45] the Lord had given you the city
[1:40:47] verse 17 and the city shall be a curse
[1:40:52] now that word is a little bit tricky
[1:40:57] it's a little bit tricky
[1:41:00] a curse who means something that is
[1:41:03] cursed it could also mean something that
[1:41:06] is dedicated
[1:41:10] praise the Lord
[1:41:12] amen it could mean something that is
[1:41:14] dedicated
[1:41:16] now so just follow me a little bit yeah
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:21] and the city shall be a cursed even a uh
[1:41:26] and all that is there in
[1:41:30] told the law
[1:41:33] now that's where the catch is
[1:41:36] it shall be accursed toward the lord
[1:41:42] amen so in the sense there is that God
[1:41:47] has condemned the senator himself
[1:41:51] that he won everything
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:56] praise the Lord
[1:41:58] and that's why when God call you as
[1:42:02] a sort of God he condemned you to
[1:42:05] himself
[1:42:08] he don't only want you on Sunday
[1:42:12] praise the Lord not only when you ain't
[1:42:14] in church
[1:42:26] a curse unto the Lord
[1:42:29] condemn devoted
[1:42:33] dedicate it
[1:42:43] are we together
[1:42:50] and all that they are in to the Lord
[1:42:52] only rehab their heart shall live
[1:42:58] she and all that are with her
[1:43:02] in the house
[1:43:04] because
[1:43:06] she believed in Malachi for
[1:43:08] [Laughter]
[1:43:16] eign
[1:43:24] God please forgive me but that's the way
[1:43:27] I believe it amen
[1:43:30] because she held the messenger that was
[1:43:34] sin can we say Amen you feel more
[1:43:37] comfortable to say Amen that way that's
[1:43:39] fine that's fine I'll bear with you as
[1:43:42] you bear with me also
[1:43:45] praise the Lord the Bible says here
[1:43:49] and yet in any wise keep yourself
[1:43:54] from the accurs things
[1:43:57] least you make yourself a curse
[1:44:01] when you take all the accursing and make
[1:44:06] the calm of Israel a curse
[1:44:12] praise the Lord
[1:44:13] so you see you could bring a curse into
[1:44:17] the camp of Israel if you temper with
[1:44:20] these things that are dedicated unto the
[1:44:23] Lord
[1:44:24] that is the same principle like I said
[1:44:27] in tithing
[1:44:29] it's your money but the 10 percent is
[1:44:32] the law
[1:44:34] are you understanding that
[1:44:36] so if you is your money it's your high
[1:44:39] and high earned money
[1:44:44] praise the Lord
[1:44:46] amen
[1:44:47] I'm not on a wish hunt yet I'm preaching
[1:44:49] the word of God
[1:44:52] glory be to God
[1:44:54] I'm showing you the principle
[1:44:57] so God is saying if you temper with this
[1:45:00] dedicated part you will bring a curse
[1:45:05] into the camp because this is set aside
[1:45:09] for a purpose
[1:45:15] are you seeing the principle
[1:45:19] he changed the order of War
[1:45:22] in Leviticus the priest never goes to
[1:45:26] war
[1:45:29] praise the Lord but yeah God is not
[1:45:32] using the men of War he's using the
[1:45:34] priest
[1:45:36] and he's using seven of the priests
[1:45:46] are we together
[1:45:57] and make a mega cam of Israel a curse
[1:45:59] and trouble it
[1:46:02] but all the Savior the gold the vessels
[1:46:06] of rice and iron are consecrated to the
[1:46:09] Lord
[1:46:11] is that what the Bible says they are
[1:46:13] consecrated to the Lord
[1:46:19] they shall come into the Treasure of the
[1:46:23] Lord
[1:46:25] there were things that would be used in
[1:46:27] the Tabernacle
[1:46:30] praise the Lord
[1:46:33] so you see the idea that God is taking
[1:46:36] this entire city
[1:46:39] to himself
[1:46:44] praise the Lord
[1:46:46] you love the Lord
[1:46:54] are we together
[1:47:00] are we together
[1:47:02] are you tired
[1:47:04] praise the Lord
[1:47:06] because I have not even started

[1:48:34] really you always have a defined person
[1:48:37] that is the first nature that's our
[1:48:41] first birth is stick in this flesh very
[1:48:44] stubborn

[1:50:47] sex and drugs and all of that before now
[1:50:51] you know you are lost you are already
[1:50:52] lost by Nature
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:51:02] is how one defying person
[1:51:06] how Joshua was saying to these people
[1:51:12] they said it and all that it has
[1:51:16] is dedicated to the Lord
[1:51:20] you will always have an Akon
[1:51:25] but the children of Israel committed
[1:51:28] a trespass in their cursed him for Akon
[1:51:32] the son of coming the son of uh zidi the
[1:51:36] son of Ze ra
[1:51:39] trace him back
[1:51:41] to the Second Son of Judah
[1:51:44] from tema
[1:51:46] that's the reason why we travel
[1:51:49] all of this place
[1:51:52] because we wanted to find that Second
[1:51:54] Son the one that's supposed to be the
[1:51:56] first
[1:51:57] the one upon Whom The Raid prayer was
[1:52:01] tied on his hands
[1:52:04] he was a curse
[1:52:07] all I encouraged nature
[1:52:20] you love the Lord
[1:52:28] are we together
[1:52:32] they see us are open people
[1:52:35] the Bible is a new book
[1:52:37] thoughts of God has been released to us
[1:52:43] the thoughts in God's back part of his
[1:52:46] mind
[1:52:47] to make us to know that we bypass our
[1:52:50] tear funny
[1:52:53] praise the Lord
[1:52:54] we came to this world with all of these
[1:52:57] sticky nature stubborn and defy nature
[1:53:00] but that's not the real you
[1:53:03] don't believe that could be the real you
[1:53:05] because it's going to destroy you
[1:53:08] know
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:10] praise the Lord I don't care whatever
[1:53:13] your lowest point is you can do better
[1:53:17] you can always rise above that
[1:53:27] oh how I love the Lord
[1:53:29] how I love the Lord
[1:53:31] how I love the Lord oh let's give the
[1:53:34] Lord a hand of Praise Hallelujah
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:41] glory be to God the Bible says here the
[1:53:45] aegon the son of Kami the son of uh
[1:53:49] zebbe the son of Zira that's uh of the
[1:53:52] Trap of Judah if you want to look at
[1:53:55] that
[1:53:56] you will see there over in uh
[1:54:01] where am I here now
[1:54:03] you look back out there
[1:54:05] and uh you go down to verse 14 to verse
[1:54:09] 18 I've got just one part of the reading
[1:54:11] about just in this first verse if you
[1:54:14] want to look closely if you go back to
[1:54:16] to Judah
[1:54:18] which was the father
[1:54:20] Zara
[1:54:22] was the son
[1:54:24] the first tween that came out so if you
[1:54:27] count from
[1:54:28] to akan you have what
[1:54:32] fourth generation
[1:54:35] amen
[1:54:37] fourth generation is that truth
[1:54:40] am I right
[1:54:42] don't don't agree with me because I'm
[1:54:44] the preacher
[1:54:46] I want you to be involved in it
[1:54:50] the father of this that's one generation
[1:54:52] the father of that so this is four
[1:54:53] generation
[1:54:56] Exodus chapter 20.
[1:55:02] Exodus chapter 20.
[1:55:06] we show
[1:55:08] 10th Generation
[1:55:10] before their seed could come back into
[1:55:13] the congregation
[1:55:14] now we have it and not a full generation
[1:55:18] in Exodus chapter 20 the Bible will say
[1:55:21] God is visiting the iniquity of the
[1:55:24] fathers to the dead and the fourth
[1:55:27] generation
[1:55:32] amen
[1:55:36] the iniquity of Jacob or Judah
[1:55:44] but it's beautiful here let's re-exit it
[1:55:47] chapter 20.
[1:55:48] that is in the tanks combining
[1:55:54] praise the Lord
[1:55:56] look we come to church
[1:55:58] to enjoy the word of God
[1:56:01] not to tell you Bible stories I'm not a
[1:56:03] politician I'm not running for running
[1:56:05] the campaign
[1:56:06] to tell you which party you should vote
[1:56:08] for
[1:56:10] we we come to enjoy the world
[1:56:13] are you enjoying the word
[1:56:15] praise the Lord
[1:56:16] okay
[1:56:18] so let's enjoy
[1:56:20] the Bible says here thou shall have no
[1:56:24] other gods before me that's chapter
[1:56:26] verse 3 of Exodus chapter 20 thou shall
[1:56:30] not make unto thee any grieving image
[1:56:34] or any likeness of anything that is that
[1:56:38] is in heavens above or that is in the
[1:56:40] earth below and all that is in the
[1:56:43] waters under the Earth they are sure
[1:56:45] thou shall not bow down thyself to them
[1:56:48] don't serve them I was I was selling
[1:56:50] this yesterday something caught my mind
[1:56:53] that I've never seen before
[1:56:56] that I've never seen before that God is
[1:56:59] going to tie the the engraving image
[1:57:03] because you have to realize to know that
[1:57:05] it is man that make gravity image it's
[1:57:08] man that makes idol God never make idol
[1:57:10] God make a tree they cut it down and
[1:57:13] they build their own Idol
[1:57:16] praise the Lord so God yeah that's going
[1:57:19] to a Time
[1:57:22] the worshiping of an idol
[1:57:25] as an iniquity
[1:57:27] as something in a dream
[1:57:31] that we hunt down to the fifth
[1:57:35] generation
[1:57:37] man I'm telling you I can get in this
[1:57:40] and I will keep you here the whole day
[1:57:42] praise the Lord
[1:57:44] we never book a restaurant for us to eat
[1:57:47] I think you have money to give you your
[1:57:49] favorite food today so I won't do it
[1:57:52] praise the Lord
[1:57:54] amen
[1:57:56] but I'm telling you yeah it's so
[1:57:59] it's so why the fourth generation
[1:58:03] why the fourth generation because Bob
[1:58:07] the curse and the blessing runs down to
[1:58:10] the fourth generation
[1:58:13] God told Abraham I will bring you back
[1:58:16] to this land after 400 years fourth
[1:58:20] generation
[1:58:26] he says in your fourth generation
[1:58:30] Moses was part of the fourth generation
[1:58:36] Abraham Isaac
[1:58:39] Jacob
[1:58:41] praise the Lord
[1:58:44] and Jacob ha the Patriots
[1:58:48] and Levi was one of his son out of Levi
[1:58:52] was born amra
[1:58:54] which is the fourth generation
[1:58:56] and amaran born Moses
[1:59:02] are we together
[1:59:03] now but look at this it's very
[1:59:05] interesting uh little kids this is for
[1:59:07] you this is for you you got to pay
[1:59:09] attention to you
[1:59:11] thou shall make no grieving image I mean
[1:59:14] we make gravy image of everything
[1:59:17] praise the Lord amen and I will tell you
[1:59:20] it's not in a bad way but the first Idol
[1:59:24] to a child is the appearing
[1:59:28] praise the Lord
[1:59:32] and the way we relate to God that's how
[1:59:37] our children learn from us if they never
[1:59:39] see you praying they will never know how
[1:59:41] to go in prayer
[1:59:44] and they never see you reading the Bible
[1:59:45] they will never learn it
[1:59:52] praise the Lord
[1:59:57] now because your worship is so a true
[2:00:00] and a living God and your child looks
[2:00:03] unto you I mean uh uh yeah I mean your
[2:00:07] your daddy should be your Idol
[2:00:09] you want to be like your daddy you want
[2:00:11] to be like your mommy
[2:00:15] in a good sense
[2:00:18] are we together now so the Bible is
[2:00:21] saying here but if you start to build a
[2:00:25] grieving image it will be a grieving
[2:00:27] image if you are copying after Hollywood
[2:00:30] and all that the child can know is just
[2:00:34] year abusive and just in filthiness
[2:00:38] praise the Lord
[2:00:46] amen then that adultery runs down
[2:00:52] from that child to the child that they
[2:00:54] will give birth to the next child
[2:01:00] are we together not just washed it I
[2:01:03] don't know if you would appreciate like
[2:01:04] I did appreciate thou shall not bow down
[2:01:07] thyself to them not sell them for I am
[2:01:10] the Lord thy God verse 5 I'm a jealous
[2:01:13] God visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[2:01:17] upon the children onto the tear and the
[2:01:19] fourth generation so yeah with Akon case
[2:01:22] he was visited with the iniquity object
[2:01:24] of Judah
[2:01:26] that's where I'm going with that but
[2:01:29] right here the Bible says here that God
[2:01:32] says that he's visiting the iniquity to
[2:01:34] deter that the fourth generation of them
[2:01:36] that hit me
[2:01:38] and showing Mercy unto the thousands of
[2:01:41] them that love me so he's in he's he's
[2:01:44] visiting in both ways he's visiting
[2:01:47] iniquity he also visiting them they love
[2:01:50] him
[2:01:52] and he's giving them Mercy
[2:01:54] praise the Lord
[2:01:56] he's giving them Mercy
[2:02:00] now but what caused my attention here
[2:02:03] uh
[2:02:07] is the other
[2:02:08] poor in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 13 He
[2:02:13] says children
[2:02:14] obey your parents
[2:02:17] amen he said honor your father and
[2:02:19] mother
[2:02:21] he said this is the only commandment
[2:02:23] with a promise
[2:02:24] now that struck my mind last night and I
[2:02:27] was thinking
[2:02:28] oh my god I've read this before
[2:02:31] I preached this before but it's coming
[2:02:33] in a completely different way to me he
[2:02:35] already said God has already laid out a
[2:02:38] commandment
[2:02:40] of the Paris iniquity visiting the
[2:02:42] children
[2:02:44] and yeah he made a provision for the
[2:02:47] children now to break out of that
[2:02:52] how are you going to break out of it
[2:02:55] it's not about you try thinking that you
[2:02:57] are wiser than your parents are smarter
[2:02:59] than your parents
[2:03:00] but the Bible says honor
[2:03:04] mother
[2:03:07] honor your father and your mother
[2:03:18] praise the Lord
[2:03:22] glory be to God
[2:03:25] because sometimes we think that we we
[2:03:27] are smarter
[2:03:29] you know how to operate the iPhone your
[2:03:31] father don't know how to do it
[2:03:33] so now you think you are smarter
[2:03:37] praise the Lord
[2:03:41] but you see God made a provision here
[2:03:46] for a try
[2:03:49] it is the reason of the son but Abraham
[2:03:51] said the baptism of the Holy Ghost break
[2:03:53] us from that curse
[2:03:56] but God honored his Lord year that's
[2:03:58] making a provision
[2:04:03] now many of us have believed in parents
[2:04:08] some of our parents are not believers
[2:04:13] some of our parents don't have the same
[2:04:15] conviction that we have
[2:04:20] but how many times church has turned
[2:04:23] family against himself
[2:04:32] breaking that law of God
[2:04:41] you are turning yourself over to the
[2:04:43] curse
[2:04:45] praise the Lord
[2:04:48] Hallelujah
[2:04:51] and I'll say to you young people
[2:04:58] young sisters no matter how much you
[2:05:00] love that boy
[2:05:03] like the stars of Heaven
[2:05:07] to realize you had a boy in your life
[2:05:10] you had a man in your life that was your
[2:05:13] daddy
[2:05:13] no matter how poor he is if that boy
[2:05:17] cannot respect your father you are not
[2:05:20] going down the right rule
[2:05:22] I don't care how much gold and diamond
[2:05:24] he promised you
[2:05:30] praise the Lord
[2:05:35] if your parents don't believe the
[2:05:37] message
[2:05:38] you must live the life
[2:05:41] live your life
[2:05:43] be a man I understand the mystery but
[2:05:46] they will respect your love
[2:05:48] live the life that will convince them
[2:05:56] it's a problem
[2:06:00] because we are in a millennial
[2:06:02] generation
[2:06:03] because you're we are in a tech
[2:06:05] generation
[2:06:06] that Lord of God was written before your
[2:06:09] technology
[2:06:19] if you really love you
[2:06:22] he will love and respect
[2:06:25] your parents
[2:06:28] they raise you up
[2:06:31] they send you to school
[2:06:35] praise the Lord the boy your first dress
[2:06:38] before now he's seeing you to be praying
[2:06:40] where was he
[2:06:50] sorry I don't know how I got down this
[2:06:52] road

[2:07:04] is my purpose of preaching this I can
[2:07:07] stand behind brother Branham and say I'm
[2:07:09] having the same purpose
[2:07:11] this is my purpose of preaching this
[2:07:14] the church is always trying to take
[2:07:17] somebody else's Corner we always want to
[2:07:20] be like somebody
[2:07:22] always copycat
[2:07:26] be yourself

[2:08:23] their poor condition

[2:08:43] these mothers those people they are
[2:08:46] having heartbreak right they can't keep
[2:08:48] relationships

[2:08:52] they cannot keep relationships they're
[2:08:54] they're married and then that's not
[2:08:56] their own Opera to get a new husband and
[2:08:57] all of that and that's the people you
[2:08:59] want to inspire your life after
[2:09:08] Ruth has to glean in the field
[2:09:14] one thing that pleased her the Naomi was
[2:09:17] so uh generous
[2:09:20] to allow her to come to this Lane
[2:09:23] the culture is not like her culture that
[2:09:27] she knows the people don't dress like
[2:09:29] the way that she knows
[2:09:38] she loved her
[2:09:40] praise the Lord
[2:09:42] glory be to God
[2:09:45] for the mother of father and the more
[2:09:47] abide she will not even having in her
[2:09:49] mind
[2:09:52] already knowing the way that the Jews
[2:09:55] there with the mohabbat
[2:09:59] god of the Heaven and Earth
[2:10:05] kept the prince of the Harvest
[2:10:09] almighty God kept the lord of the
[2:10:12] Hobbies Boaz
[2:10:25] the church is always trying to take
[2:10:27] somebody else's corner
[2:10:30] but don't do that
[2:10:34] you can never raise corn in Ephraim
[2:10:37] Connor
[2:10:38] if you are Mana self
[2:10:41] you have got to take your place in
[2:10:45] Christ
[2:10:48] praise the Lord not in your Tribal
[2:10:51] Spirit or your National Spirit you have
[2:10:54] to find your place
[2:10:58] in Christ the word

[2:11:07] of why God allow you to breathe the
[2:11:11] Breath of Life
[2:11:13] find your place
[2:11:18] so as you would just be a Wandering Star
[2:11:20] trying to be like this trying to be like
[2:11:22] that
[2:11:23] and at the end you don't even know who
[2:11:25] you are
[2:11:33] see Canada did not represent the great
[2:11:36] Heaven because
[2:11:37] because it's War
[2:11:39] the trouble and the killing fighting and
[2:11:41] so forth but it didn't represent this
[2:11:44] that it must be a perfect walk
[2:11:48] God was watching the award that's the
[2:11:51] reason why he ordered their steps
[2:11:54] name
[2:11:58] Canada land was all about their work
[2:12:01] their behavior
[2:12:04] their behavior
[2:12:11] that's what matters

[2:12:29] don't create a better a dark atmosphere
[2:12:33] around you
[2:12:37] no space of light
[2:12:40] because they came
[2:12:43] they came it's not the clothes you put

[2:18:29] that need to be pleased in this building

[2:19:42] Joshua
[2:19:43] after he crossed into the land God gave
[2:19:46] him the promise to fight an entire
[2:19:49] campaign
[2:19:50] without losing the man
[2:19:53] just like I said uh last Sunday

[2:20:15] we are all in the house of God and we
[2:20:18] want to see God moving
[2:20:20] praise the Lord
[2:20:23] we rather hard there will not be a
[2:20:25] national Revival
[2:20:27] but I still believe that the world can
[2:20:29] stir us up I still believe that the
[2:20:31] world can revive us
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:47] foreign
[2:20:51] campaign without losing the man without
[2:20:54] getting the stretch without having to
[2:20:58] fight uh having to have a nurse
[2:21:02] or the first aid God said the lane is
[2:21:05] yours go fight think
[2:21:07] of fighting a campaign
[2:21:10] and there is no Red Cross around at all
[2:21:13] there's nobody going to get hurt
[2:21:17] praise the Lord
[2:21:21] but if there is one place
[2:21:23] in the word
[2:21:25] where people are hurt is in church
[2:21:29] hurt
[2:21:30] of mistrust
[2:21:33] heard of deception
[2:21:39] in church
[2:21:46] take advantage of others
[2:21:57] when this is the place where
[2:22:00] we must have Honorable Men people that
[2:22:03] can keep their word
[2:22:06] people that tie their character to their
[2:22:09] name
[2:22:14] but go to the churches

[2:22:22] even in the business world in the
[2:22:25] business world you're having you're
[2:22:27] having men Christmas men that God has
[2:22:30] blessed
[2:22:32] but they always try to keep their faith
[2:22:36] behind
[2:22:39] why because
[2:22:41] as soon as people find that they are
[2:22:43] Christian the next thing they want to
[2:22:45] find the church that it goes to
[2:22:50] and when it goes to that church it says

[2:23:45] brother through this you can have this
[2:23:46] sister through this
[2:23:54] and you know that is not because you are

[2:27:09] and the seed of God remaineth in him
[2:27:13] and he will have no desire
[2:27:17] to do that the Bible says the worshiper
[2:27:20] wants parts

[2:31:10] now you're holding something holding you
[2:31:14] it is in the question whether

[2:31:25] on that
[2:31:27] praise the Lord

[2:31:51] during that time I couldn't keep it
[2:31:54] it kept me
