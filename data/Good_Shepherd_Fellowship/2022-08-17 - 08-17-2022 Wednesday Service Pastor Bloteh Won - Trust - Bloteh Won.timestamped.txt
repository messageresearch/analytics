[49:47] hallelujah
[49:56] let's look at the first timity chapter
[49:58] one
[49:59] first timing chapter one tonight
[50:04] i thought i was kind of a capping on the
[50:07] subject of harmony with the father and
[50:08] the son
[50:10] but i will tell you that i'm learning
[50:11] from this
[50:13] uh
[50:14] uh
[50:15] i'm learning from this and you know
[50:18] there's it's it's just like there are
[50:20] times in your life where you have trials
[50:22] there are also times where in your life
[50:24] the windows of of understanding and
[50:27] revelation open and things that's just
[50:30] pouring out praise the lord
[50:32] it stopped pouring that and what is what
[50:34] gets embarrassing sometimes it comes
[50:36] when you are right in the middle of the
[50:38] highway
[50:40] there is no way to pull pull aside and
[50:42] start writing i said oh god this thing
[50:44] is just it's just uh it's just been a
[50:47] blessing that uh uh
[50:48] first time in chapter one let's read
[50:50] here paul an apostle of jesus christ by
[50:54] the commandment of god our savior and
[50:57] lord jesus christ
[50:59] which is our hope
[51:02] amen
[51:04] he is our hope
[51:07] praise the lord
[51:08] amen
[51:09] he is our hope
[51:13] unto trinity my son my own son in the
[51:17] faith
[51:19] grace
[51:20] mercy and peace from god
[51:23] our father
[51:25] and jesus christ our lord
[51:28] heavenly father we will ask your
[51:30] blessings tonight
[51:32] and we will pray to god that you are
[51:34] blessing to your word
[51:37] come on father and teach us lord
[51:40] teach us
[51:41] in jesus name we pray
[51:43] amen the lord bless you you may have
[51:44] your seat
[51:46] now uh tonight i will try to
[51:48] to explain myself
[51:50] because uh
[51:51] it looks like i've got on one of these
[51:54] rabbit trail
[51:55] and it's hard to get off and and and
[51:59] sometimes it looks like what i mean what
[52:01] what uh
[52:02] what brother one is preaching harmony
[52:04] and father and the son and my god my god
[52:06] where are you and
[52:08] and uh
[52:09] my father my father character of israel
[52:12] now let me let me let me try to help you
[52:15] see the the inspiration i'm looking at
[52:17] here
[52:18] brother branham shared and as we've been
[52:20] reading
[52:22] and uh
[52:23] the the harmony that existed between the
[52:26] father
[52:27] and the son
[52:28] is going to be the same harmony that we
[52:31] exist between the bride and christ
[52:36] now
[52:38] father and son relationship is a
[52:40] parental relationship
[52:43] bride in christ relationship is a
[52:46] miracle relationship
[52:48] are we together
[52:52] amen
[52:54] and
[52:57] and i think that was that was that was a
[52:59] beautiful thing where uh brother jarrod
[53:02] shared that
[53:03] uh one time we were down there in a
[53:05] husky
[53:06] and uh
[53:08] we were talking some things and and he
[53:10] shared this very very beautiful concept
[53:12] you know how
[53:14] that uh
[53:16] a parent
[53:17] will never be able to know a child like
[53:20] a father you will never know your
[53:22] daughter as a wife
[53:24] for her to be known as a wife it would
[53:27] take her husband
[53:28] you will always know her as your
[53:30] daughter
[53:33] and you will never know a mother will
[53:36] never know her son as a husband
[53:41] you can only say he's a good son you can
[53:44] say he's a good husband
[53:46] he was never a husband to you
[53:50] praise the lord
[53:52] man those are some of the things that
[53:53] when it sticks it don't leave you
[53:57] when it sticks it don't leave you
[54:01] praise the lord
[54:02] amen
[54:06] and
[54:07] [Music]
[54:08] and so when you look at these two form
[54:11] of relationship
[54:12] you you you try to
[54:15] see and understand
[54:17] what was the prophet of god
[54:20] saying to us
[54:24] they are two different form of
[54:25] relationship
[54:28] it is not like
[54:29] as
[54:30] the father
[54:32] and his wife her harmony in their
[54:34] relationship so with the son and his
[54:37] wife
[54:40] have harmony
[54:42] no that's not what he's saying he's
[54:44] saying as the father
[54:47] and the son the son could do nothing
[54:50] except that which the father have shown
[54:52] him
[54:53] that harmony that existed
[54:56] between the father and the son
[54:58] and what we try to show all through the
[55:01] different
[55:02] types we've been using
[55:04] is that right from the beginning the
[55:06] first form of relationship that came
[55:10] was elohim god
[55:12] and adam the son
[55:16] praise the lord
[55:17] so for adam to be successful
[55:20] in his relationship with eve
[55:23] he had to have a successful harmony with
[55:26] the father
[55:29] that's where the time starts from
[55:31] it don't start from christ it starts
[55:34] from the first sun
[55:37] and something
[55:38] something
[55:39] hit my mind as i was meditating last
[55:43] night
[55:44] saint john chapter one
[55:48] see john chapter 1. i want to take my
[55:51] time tonight
[55:52] and recap because you see you can you
[55:54] can just
[55:56] you get in your own mind to you that you
[55:58] have you have a lot of revelation you
[56:00] are just in your own mind and you just
[56:02] come here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and
[56:04] sometimes people just looking where is
[56:06] he going
[56:09] can you please stop and tell us
[56:12] where is this vehicle going
[56:16] so i want to just recap here
[56:19] and that's the way
[56:21] i will i think that
[56:24] you will be able to be in
[56:26] the understanding of what we're trying
[56:28] to bring to the church saint john
[56:30] chapter 1 verse 18.
[56:33] i have a bunch of
[56:35] quotes tonight i would read
[56:38] i i just i had a i had a good different
[56:41] sets of them
[56:42] that i wanted to take my time because i
[56:44] get caught up in my emotions and i
[56:47] really don't
[56:49] uh read those quotes to be able to
[56:51] establish what we're trying to bring to
[56:53] you
[56:54] but in john chapter 1 verse 18 jesus
[56:57] said no man has seen
[57:00] god at any time
[57:03] god is a spirit
[57:06] no man has seen god at any time
[57:10] the only begotten son which is in the
[57:13] bosom of the father
[57:15] he have declared him
[57:19] hold your place there let's go to psalm
[57:21] chapter 19
[57:24] if mine bible
[57:27] memory is right
[57:31] psalm chapter 19
[57:33] just hold your place there
[57:36] psalm chapter 19. i just i just want to
[57:39] show you something here
[57:42] psalm chapter 19 verse 1.
[57:48] the heavens
[57:50] declare that's the word i want you to
[57:53] pay attention to
[57:55] jesus said
[57:58] the purpose of the son
[58:01] was to declare the father
[58:05] if that was the purpose of the first son
[58:08] that would be the purpose of every
[58:11] child
[58:15] praise the lord
[58:18] amen
[58:20] that would be the purpose of every son
[58:22] of god
[58:23] every daughter of god
[58:27] so he says here david said
[58:30] the heavens declared the glory of god
[58:34] and the farming men show his handiwork
[58:37] now so jesus is saying no man have seen
[58:41] god
[58:42] he's a spirit
[58:43] but the only begotten came to declare
[58:48] make known the father
[58:51] and what the paul said
[58:53] the whole creation was groaning for
[58:59] the whole creation was groaning for the
[59:01] manifestation
[59:04] what is that manifestation declaring the
[59:06] father
[59:09] the manifestation of the son of god was
[59:11] not was not for us to make big names
[59:16] not to make our name was not to make any
[59:19] man's name
[59:21] that manifestation was to declare the
[59:23] father that's the reason why when
[59:25] brother brandon preached uh uh joshua
[59:28] a parallel efficient when he preached
[59:30] that entire series all he was talking
[59:33] about the way adam manifested that that
[59:36] thing that he lost
[59:38] that's what was going to be restored
[59:39] back to the church
[59:41] now so you see the the the reason the
[59:44] purpose of the message of the hour the
[59:48] reason why god would send a prophet to
[59:51] reveal
[59:52] all bring back all the loose ends reveal
[59:56] the the mysteries that were healing from
[59:58] the foundation of the word god's purpose
[1:00:01] in his mind of producing a son was to
[1:00:04] declare himself
[1:00:07] praise the lord
[1:00:08] if we cannot show god to a dying word we
[1:00:12] we don't have a message
[1:00:16] we don't have a message
[1:00:19] if the message is just just good for us
[1:00:22] to make us critical
[1:00:26] amen
[1:00:27] and think that everybody in the world is
[1:00:29] a separate seed and everybody is going
[1:00:31] to hell and we're going in the rapture
[1:00:33] if if that's your concept of the message
[1:00:36] you have not got the revelation yet
[1:00:40] you have not got the revelation
[1:00:43] the purpose
[1:00:44] of god
[1:00:47] verb says why the god gave adam a wife
[1:00:50] to produce himself
[1:00:52] why would god have a bride to produce
[1:00:55] himself
[1:01:04] praise the lord
[1:01:06] so how will god achieve that
[1:01:10] right from the beginning
[1:01:12] so
[1:01:13] in in terms of father and son
[1:01:18] god used the prophets
[1:01:21] of every age verb says in the message uh
[1:01:24] uh god's transforming power
[1:01:26] he says when god turned the work over to
[1:01:30] to adam he says god never did any work
[1:01:32] again he raised up men in every age to
[1:01:34] do his work
[1:01:38] praise the lord
[1:01:40] so uh uh the the the
[1:01:43] the
[1:01:46] the type what i want you to keep in your
[1:01:48] mind here when we're talking about the
[1:01:50] father and the son you you take it right
[1:01:53] down from elohim and adam you can bring
[1:01:56] it down go there with noah as a son
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:02] praise the lord
[1:02:04] so
[1:02:04] in in in every age
[1:02:07] god will raise up
[1:02:10] uh uh a prophet
[1:02:13] noah to bring the people through the
[1:02:15] flood abraham was dead you know uh to
[1:02:17] establish a covenant with god moses was
[1:02:20] there to bring the people out of the
[1:02:22] land back to the promise that god gave
[1:02:25] to abraham
[1:02:27] praise the lord
[1:02:28] so
[1:02:29] just like how god would deal with the
[1:02:32] prophet
[1:02:33] as a son
[1:02:35] god will now
[1:02:37] use the prophet
[1:02:39] and deal with a people
[1:02:45] so now
[1:02:46] it will be as the father achieved the
[1:02:49] harmony
[1:02:50] now so this son now that has a ministry
[1:02:55] will now
[1:02:56] uh uh
[1:02:59] get harmony
[1:03:00] with the people
[1:03:02] that he's uh that he's called to lead
[1:03:06] praise the lord
[1:03:08] amen
[1:03:10] noah achieved it he was able to bring
[1:03:12] the animals to
[1:03:14] harmony that they were in the act there
[1:03:17] was no fighting
[1:03:19] the lion was not eating the goat
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] so he was able to achieve that harmony
[1:03:28] in his own church
[1:03:33] praise the lord
[1:03:36] moses
[1:03:38] got a tough time
[1:03:40] when he got got to egypt the people
[1:03:43] resented him
[1:03:45] but when they started to see him
[1:03:47] declaring the father
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] they knew that a man could not turn
[1:03:55] water into blood
[1:03:57] knew that a man could not say let there
[1:03:59] be frogs and frost fill all the place so
[1:04:02] when they when they saw moses declaring
[1:04:04] the father
[1:04:05] harmony starts to create
[1:04:10] harmony now starts to quit the very
[1:04:12] people that was resenting him start now
[1:04:15] to follow his instruction slay the lamb
[1:04:17] put the lamb on your doorpost we will be
[1:04:19] out of here
[1:04:21] what did there because they saw him
[1:04:23] declaring the father
[1:04:27] they wouldn't have trust moses for
[1:04:29] nothing
[1:04:31] if they never saw
[1:04:33] an attribute of the father
[1:04:38] are we together
[1:04:40] praise the lord but see how god
[1:04:43] will work this thing out
[1:04:46] as he evines
[1:04:48] in using
[1:04:50] different men in different dispensation
[1:04:54] he will also
[1:04:56] give the prophet
[1:04:59] of an age the ability to be a father
[1:05:03] to a son
[1:05:05] like moses will be to joshua
[1:05:09] sure
[1:05:11] are we together
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:14] like moses will be to joshua
[1:05:18] so moses will now be a father spiritual
[1:05:21] father like elijah will be to elijah
[1:05:27] praise the lord
[1:05:29] amen
[1:05:30] so you you'll see that all through the
[1:05:32] ages now
[1:05:34] now you will you will now realize why i
[1:05:37] read this
[1:05:39] the verse that that we read
[1:05:41] timing my own son
[1:05:49] this was the first prophet to the
[1:05:51] gentile age
[1:05:52] paul
[1:05:56] and now all that the same thing that god
[1:05:59] did through the dispensation
[1:06:02] through the dispensation he's going to
[1:06:05] do the same thing now dealing with the
[1:06:07] gentile church
[1:06:10] but you have to realize that the gentile
[1:06:13] age has only two major prophet why
[1:06:18] because it's the return of the alpha and
[1:06:22] the omega
[1:06:25] so it's going to be at the beginning of
[1:06:27] the gentile age
[1:06:29] where paul will be a prophet to the
[1:06:32] gentile church
[1:06:34] right
[1:06:37] amen
[1:06:40] now it's it's it's it's it's amazing
[1:06:44] peter the apostle
[1:06:47] the one that was giving the key
[1:06:49] you realize that that in in scriptural
[1:06:52] design peter never used this kind of a
[1:06:55] language
[1:06:57] to call any man his son
[1:07:00] sure
[1:07:03] in scripture design you never see it
[1:07:10] he did not had a dispensational
[1:07:12] responsibility
[1:07:18] praise the lord
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:24] look at something paul said here
[1:07:27] in philippians chapter 4 verse 9.
[1:07:36] philippians chapter 4 verse 9.
[1:07:51] he says those things which ye
[1:07:54] have both learned
[1:07:56] and received
[1:07:58] and heard
[1:08:00] and see in me
[1:08:03] do
[1:08:05] and the god of peace
[1:08:08] shall be
[1:08:09] with you
[1:08:11] the things
[1:08:13] that you have learned of me
[1:08:16] watching my life
[1:08:19] the things you have received
[1:08:22] of me
[1:08:24] who is this man what authority he has
[1:08:29] he was the same one that says follow me
[1:08:32] as i follow christ
[1:08:38] praise the lord
[1:08:40] amen now you see the the reason why
[1:08:42] people struggle
[1:08:44] around the end time messenger is because
[1:08:50] the alpha and omega goes together
[1:08:54] if you don't understand how god works in
[1:08:56] the alpha ministry you're going to
[1:08:58] struggle with the omega ministry
[1:09:03] you're going to struggle
[1:09:10] those things that you have learned of me
[1:09:16] you have received
[1:09:20] you have seen in me
[1:09:27] praise the lord
[1:09:31] are we together
[1:09:33] oh yeah it's so easy i mean if you were
[1:09:36] in that time and paul is saying that you
[1:09:39] could you could you could closely come
[1:09:41] to the place and say you want these
[1:09:43] people to worship him
[1:09:50] praise the lord you could come closely
[1:09:52] to say he want the people to worship him
[1:09:55] now so
[1:09:57] this is how i lose track of
[1:09:59] of myself and then i started i started
[1:10:02] going all over the place so what i want
[1:10:04] us to to be able to follow is not just
[1:10:07] to preach or to make uh
[1:10:10] uh make you excited
[1:10:12] but to be able to to to grab the concept
[1:10:16] sure
[1:10:19] to grab what the spirit is saying to the
[1:10:21] church
[1:10:24] so here is it in the alpha ministry we
[1:10:27] see
[1:10:28] the the prophet of the age the apostle
[1:10:31] paul
[1:10:33] he says i'm a messenger i'm a prophet
[1:10:35] unto the gentiles paul himself said it
[1:10:40] praise the lord
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:44] maybe you maybe you get confused but
[1:10:46] then why he's called an apostle he was
[1:10:48] an apostle by
[1:10:50] gift
[1:10:53] but by calling
[1:10:55] he was a prophet
[1:10:56] to the gentiles
[1:11:01] amen
[1:11:05] brother branham was
[1:11:07] an evangelist by gift
[1:11:11] that was what was in his commission due
[1:11:12] to the work of an evangelist
[1:11:17] but he was a prophet
[1:11:19] by calling to the age
[1:11:24] as a reason why he could not get away
[1:11:25] from rebuking people
[1:11:27] because it was part of his nature it was
[1:11:30] part of what he was
[1:11:32] now so uh so that's what i want us to
[1:11:35] see
[1:11:37] that's what i want us to see
[1:11:39] moses was able to have
[1:11:41] a faithful son
[1:11:44] joshua
[1:11:46] caleb came along
[1:11:47] to support him
[1:11:49] verbum talks about the relationship of
[1:11:51] caleb and joshua
[1:11:53] praise the lord
[1:11:54] elijah was able to have a faithful son
[1:11:58] in so much that he received a double
[1:12:01] portion
[1:12:05] are we
[1:12:06] together now
[1:12:09] when when
[1:12:10] when god achieved it
[1:12:14] it's a success that's the reason why god
[1:12:17] told elijah no they are 70 they have not
[1:12:20] bowed down right
[1:12:23] amen
[1:12:24] they are 70 if you are an obedient son
[1:12:28] there will be a success
[1:12:32] but if god cannot get a man
[1:12:35] in the age
[1:12:36] the whole age is doomed
[1:12:41] the whole age is dumb
[1:12:43] go and read books
[1:12:46] they will tell you that
[1:12:48] the father of divine healing is william
[1:12:50] branham
[1:12:51] go and read books not message books
[1:12:59] all of these are pushing here that uh
[1:13:03] caramastic is doing and uh you know
[1:13:05] trying to descend and all of that when
[1:13:08] when when god started using brother
[1:13:10] branham it brought a completely
[1:13:12] different light
[1:13:13] look at men like ff bosworth every boss
[1:13:15] was preached everybody was retired
[1:13:18] he has retired from preaching
[1:13:21] before he even met brother branham
[1:13:24] one time he brought a brand administrate
[1:13:26] he came back to the ministry
[1:13:29] he said this is the thing that we were
[1:13:30] looking for out of these years
[1:13:34] he came out of retirement
[1:13:44] so you see to every age
[1:13:46] it's almost like to every home
[1:13:49] the way the home is balanced there must
[1:13:51] be a ahead of the home the father
[1:13:57] there must be a head of the home
[1:14:03] are we together
[1:14:07] so
[1:14:08] uh
[1:14:09] uh you know this this this is the way
[1:14:11] that god has worked through through the
[1:14:14] ages
[1:14:17] it's a principle
[1:14:18] that he that that he have worked
[1:14:21] and then and then i went about talking
[1:14:25] about uh
[1:14:28] the cry of the hebrew mother
[1:14:31] the cry of the father
[1:14:34] and the cry of the son
[1:14:38] we spoke about the three christ
[1:14:41] when a child
[1:14:42] is about to be born the hebrew mother go
[1:14:45] into travel and she cry
[1:14:48] praise the lord
[1:14:49] it shows that your birth is important
[1:14:54] your birth speaks about your foundation
[1:14:58] it speaks about your beginning
[1:15:04] praise lord
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:07] it speaks about your beginning
[1:15:13] let's uh
[1:15:18] peter said we are born again by the sea
[1:15:21] incorruptible
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:28] that that must be the beginning of our
[1:15:31] birth
[1:15:32] the beginning of our birth must never be
[1:15:35] following our parents to church
[1:15:41] praise the lord
[1:15:43] if that is the beginning of your birth
[1:15:45] there will be a time where you will
[1:15:46] struggle
[1:15:53] the beginning of your birth must never
[1:15:55] be
[1:15:56] the the excitement oh we are in the
[1:15:58] message the message the message and you
[1:16:00] just follow all the emotion
[1:16:03] if the seed is not there if the seed
[1:16:07] incorruptible is nothing
[1:16:09] you will struggle
[1:16:12] you will struggle
[1:16:16] so it is that cry of the mother
[1:16:19] why because the cry of the mother
[1:16:22] prophesied over the sun
[1:16:27] when she cried oh judah just making that
[1:16:30] noise in the way she screamed oh that's
[1:16:34] a kind
[1:16:38] the things that she says
[1:16:42] in that travel
[1:16:46] your birth is very
[1:16:48] important
[1:16:50] your beginning
[1:16:51] is very very important
[1:16:56] praise the lord
[1:17:01] that's the reason why jesus said we must
[1:17:03] be born again
[1:17:04] it's a matter of must
[1:17:08] it's a matter of
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:14] must because our birth is very important
[1:17:20] now
[1:17:21] the cry of the father
[1:17:24] will now relate with the cry of the
[1:17:27] mother
[1:17:31] they are see incorruptible
[1:17:34] they are beginning they are birth that
[1:17:37] that that have taken place in you now
[1:17:40] the cry of the father now is the
[1:17:42] position positionally place you
[1:17:47] so honor the mother you have out of this
[1:17:49] care when you are born again god place
[1:17:52] you in the ministry he place you in a
[1:17:54] church he place you around people you
[1:17:56] have all of this kid as you are coming
[1:17:58] up you are coming brother branham in the
[1:18:00] message
[1:18:03] he talked about noun you are honored a
[1:18:05] teacher
[1:18:08] your father is giving you one try a year
[1:18:11] and trusting you with this and and all
[1:18:13] of this and and
[1:18:15] and then there come a time
[1:18:17] where the father must positionally place
[1:18:21] you
[1:18:24] praise the lord
[1:18:26] amen
[1:18:28] not knowing our our place
[1:18:33] where we are positionally placed
[1:18:36] sometimes
[1:18:37] it can make people to to room about
[1:18:46] it can make people to desire to be like
[1:18:48] other people
[1:18:50] i learned this thing today as i was i
[1:18:52] was thinking about something you know i
[1:18:54] was i was uh meditating or doing uh uh i
[1:18:57] think i was listening to a message or
[1:18:59] something like that but i i learned this
[1:19:02] today
[1:19:03] and uh and and it all came from the word
[1:19:06] of being a hypocrite
[1:19:09] that word hypocrite goes back to
[1:19:12] being an utter
[1:19:14] brahman says that's what the pharisees
[1:19:16] were
[1:19:17] amen now realize now i'm trying to take
[1:19:20] my time now i want to i want to grab you
[1:19:22] into
[1:19:23] into uh what what i've been i've been
[1:19:25] talking about and you will realize that
[1:19:28] what and what i learned that really hit
[1:19:31] me today you see that's the reason why
[1:19:35] all
[1:19:36] and most of the movie stars
[1:19:40] when they come
[1:19:41] to the end of their career
[1:19:44] they become
[1:19:46] they become so lost they become so
[1:19:48] confused you know and most of them have
[1:19:51] a very bad end
[1:19:53] why because out of their life they have
[1:19:56] acted like somebody else
[1:20:01] their career has made them to act
[1:20:03] because the the writer of the of the
[1:20:05] movie tell you that this role that you
[1:20:08] are playing this is the way this woman
[1:20:10] behave
[1:20:12] then you move from this movie and go to
[1:20:14] the next movie she tell you this is the
[1:20:17] way that this guy behave so all of your
[1:20:19] life you are acting like someone else
[1:20:22] so you grow up into death
[1:20:26] acting like this person acting like that
[1:20:27] person when they finally come
[1:20:30] to the end of their career they don't
[1:20:32] even know themselves
[1:20:34] because they have never been themselves
[1:20:42] they have never been themselves
[1:20:49] they have just played people all of your
[1:20:51] life
[1:20:53] so when they finally
[1:20:58] they finally
[1:20:59] come to themselves they don't know
[1:21:01] themselves
[1:21:02] they don't know their their actual self
[1:21:04] because they have acted like susan they
[1:21:05] are acted like jennifer they are out
[1:21:08] there all the different
[1:21:12] lifestyles and it's a terrible thing
[1:21:18] it's a terrible thing
[1:21:20] to add like people
[1:21:29] praise the lord
[1:21:31] so the cry of the father genesis 49
[1:21:34] that's what jacob did he was placing the
[1:21:37] sons into the promise
[1:21:40] calling them one by one and and you know
[1:21:42] and and placing them
[1:21:45] but whatever that he was placing them
[1:21:48] was under the very same prophecy
[1:21:51] that's the reason why
[1:21:53] your birth is important
[1:21:55] your beginning is very important
[1:22:02] praise the lord
[1:22:04] now most of the time uh uh uh
[1:22:08] you know this this scripture ignoring
[1:22:10] our call in election
[1:22:13] or making our call in election show is
[1:22:16] they have always been taken in a way
[1:22:19] where we have to do something to make
[1:22:21] our call and election show
[1:22:24] what can you do for somebody to call you
[1:22:28] what the samuel did
[1:22:31] for god to call him
[1:22:33] and he thought that it was eli calling
[1:22:34] him
[1:22:39] it's always is is it's with a more deep
[1:22:42] sense
[1:22:43] of knowing who call you
[1:22:48] who call you
[1:22:51] how did you get to this
[1:22:56] how did you get to this place
[1:22:58] who called you
[1:23:01] what is the thing that is calling to
[1:23:03] your heart are you are you just coming
[1:23:05] because you are following or there is a
[1:23:08] desire
[1:23:09] there is a voice you are hearing
[1:23:13] it's making sure
[1:23:15] we call
[1:23:20] even though little samuel could not
[1:23:22] identify he thought it was ela but it
[1:23:24] was god calling him
[1:23:28] and because it was god calling him his
[1:23:30] journey was setting
[1:23:32] when he came to the place to realize
[1:23:34] that i'm not called by a man i'm not
[1:23:37] called by the church i'm called by god
[1:23:40] brother branham says i thank god he got
[1:23:42] a hold of me before the church
[1:23:52] that's the reason why your birth is very
[1:23:54] very important
[1:23:57] it's very important
[1:24:05] now so the father
[1:24:07] cried is placing the son
[1:24:09] the cry of the son my father my father
[1:24:12] the chariot of ezra
[1:24:14] the cry of the sun
[1:24:17] is confidence in the father
[1:24:22] is dependent jesus said the son can do
[1:24:24] nothing
[1:24:27] the father the son is is declaring
[1:24:31] that without you i can do nothing my
[1:24:33] father my father
[1:24:37] david reigned his clothes and said oh
[1:24:39] journey turned and and and saw they were
[1:24:42] pleasant in their life they were just
[1:24:44] they were swiftly like eagles they were
[1:24:46] stronger like lions
[1:24:50] the ego and lion anointing we are not
[1:24:52] the first people that learn it
[1:24:54] israel knew it yes
[1:24:58] because it was identified with their
[1:25:00] tribes
[1:25:02] the four tribes the the four sets of of
[1:25:05] israel trapped each one of them were
[1:25:07] identified with this it was a symbol to
[1:25:11] the tribe
[1:25:20] so the crowd of the mother
[1:25:22] is your birth
[1:25:25] that's what happened
[1:25:28] when you're going through some things
[1:25:29] they say oh god oh god help me oh oh god
[1:25:33] help me you know what you're doing
[1:25:35] you're saying my god my god why have
[1:25:36] that forsaken me
[1:25:43] praise the lord
[1:25:49] so i just i wanted to bring us
[1:25:52] i wanted to bring us to a place
[1:25:54] and uh just to kind of recap on these
[1:25:57] things so you can you can be able to
[1:25:59] grab
[1:26:02] where i've been trying to go with all of
[1:26:04] these thoughts
[1:26:06] but
[1:26:07] you have to realize that
[1:26:09] the purpose
[1:26:11] of the son was to declare the father and
[1:26:14] that's what we call manifestation
[1:26:19] praise the
[1:26:20] lord
[1:26:22] manifestation and that's the reason why
[1:26:25] god has to bring a son of man ministry
[1:26:28] in this age
[1:26:29] once again to declare
[1:26:32] because is is the manifestation time
[1:26:39] so the purpose of the message is to
[1:26:41] declare the father
[1:26:46] that some do not care how you criticize
[1:26:48] it
[1:26:51] it does not worry about what you will
[1:26:53] say about it
[1:26:55] but when it comes out
[1:26:57] it comes to declare the father
[1:27:00] the heavens declared
[1:27:04] the glory of god
[1:27:09] david said it's like the sun coming out
[1:27:11] like a strong man out of his chamber
[1:27:16] and that is the same reason
[1:27:21] now so brother branham would now or he
[1:27:22] would now he will now teach us and and
[1:27:24] make us to realize you know that before
[1:27:27] the sun is brought out and positioned on
[1:27:30] the place by the father he goes on a
[1:27:32] teachership
[1:27:34] so god will use different things in our
[1:27:37] life to teach us
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:41] he will teach us by the way of sickness
[1:27:44] for us to know that he's a healer
[1:27:46] he will teach us by the way of being
[1:27:48] broke to know that he's a provoder
[1:27:51] so he will allow
[1:27:53] you know when when when when uh when the
[1:27:57] when the church were has the idea
[1:28:00] that you don't have to go through this
[1:28:03] thing if you are a christian you you
[1:28:04] will not have to be broke if you are a
[1:28:06] christian you will not have to be sick i
[1:28:08] mean they they they don't really
[1:28:10] understand the teaching of the father
[1:28:14] yes
[1:28:16] absolutely
[1:28:17] now so when the son goes through these
[1:28:20] things what is he learning
[1:28:22] he's learning to trust the ability
[1:28:26] of the father
[1:28:28] all the father want him to learn
[1:28:30] is to trust the ability of the father
[1:28:35] see brother brandon says if god tell me
[1:28:37] tomorrow go to the graveyard and and and
[1:28:40] pray for george washington he said i'm
[1:28:41] going to go there
[1:28:43] why because he's trusting the ability of
[1:28:46] the father
[1:28:48] he's not trusting the good christian
[1:28:51] life he lives
[1:28:56] you have to learn to trust the ability
[1:28:59] of the one that have called you
[1:29:02] you got to trust that he can keep you
[1:29:05] on to the day
[1:29:13] you have to that's i mean that's that's
[1:29:15] everything that he's teaching us
[1:29:18] when those things are established in us
[1:29:21] then
[1:29:22] now the same harmony that existed
[1:29:25] between the father and the son
[1:29:28] is now existing between the bride and
[1:29:30] christ
[1:29:32] that is the only way
[1:29:34] we can give christ the preeminence
[1:29:41] that's the only way we can give christ
[1:29:43] the preeminence giving christ the
[1:29:45] preeminence does not means that the
[1:29:47] first person that comes to church
[1:29:48] so when you drive in the parking lot
[1:29:50] there is no other car you say yes i'm
[1:29:52] giving god a preeminence i'm the first
[1:29:57] no
[1:30:01] that's not giving god the preeminence
[1:30:03] even though brother brahm taught us we
[1:30:04] must give him the first place
[1:30:07] yes amen
[1:30:10] we must give you in the first place now
[1:30:11] if you if you try to do all of those
[1:30:14] things mentally you just try to do them
[1:30:16] mentally
[1:30:21] i wake up i gave you in the first place
[1:30:23] i prayed i i i before i eat my food i
[1:30:25] gave in the first place if you try to do
[1:30:27] all of those things
[1:30:29] and
[1:30:30] and the relationship is not you are not
[1:30:33] trusting him you are just doing it to
[1:30:36] win
[1:30:37] his favor
[1:30:39] then you're not in harmony
[1:30:41] you still not in harmony
[1:30:44] you are just doing it to win god's favor
[1:30:50] winning his favor is different from
[1:30:52] trusting him
[1:30:56] it's different from trusting him
[1:31:08] praise the lord
[1:31:14] now so you see all of these things uh uh
[1:31:17] that's that is the harmony
[1:31:19] and verb say issue exists between the
[1:31:21] bride and christ
[1:31:23] so it's a responsibility
[1:31:26] it's a responsibility trust is a
[1:31:29] responsibility
[1:31:32] okay
[1:31:33] if i take my key
[1:31:34] and says somewhere i heard you are
[1:31:36] driving
[1:31:38] take my key the car is outside
[1:31:42] i give you my car
[1:31:45] praise the lord as lord as as uh it
[1:31:48] looks like a wonderful thing you are
[1:31:49] excited but there is a whole lot of
[1:31:51] responsibility
[1:31:54] that has been given to you
[1:31:57] praise the lord
[1:31:59] the message is a responsibility
[1:32:03] for god to call you in this age
[1:32:07] to trust you with himself
[1:32:13] praise the lord
[1:32:15] you see that was the same thing he did
[1:32:17] to joseph
[1:32:19] when mary was pregnant
[1:32:23] he had
[1:32:24] to it was not enough for joseph to rely
[1:32:29] on what mary said right
[1:32:33] god had to send the same angel
[1:32:36] the angel gibra came down and spoke to
[1:32:39] mary
[1:32:40] that i mean spoke to joseph this thing
[1:32:43] that
[1:32:43] that merit is talking about
[1:32:46] is of me
[1:32:51] praise the lord
[1:32:54] so it was a responsibility now that was
[1:32:57] on joseph
[1:33:02] he took that responsibility over his
[1:33:05] marriage vow
[1:33:08] with merit
[1:33:11] he took that responsibility
[1:33:15] of bringing the christ child
[1:33:20] more than mary is my wife
[1:33:30] praise the lord
[1:33:37] so it's not just joining church
[1:33:41] we have jesus on our hands
[1:33:49] we have
[1:33:50] we have the life of christ on our hands
[1:33:53] we have been given a responsibility and
[1:33:55] the father have trusted us
[1:33:58] yes
[1:34:00] he had trusted us
[1:34:02] that we would not feel him
[1:34:08] praise the lord
[1:34:10] amen
[1:34:13] and he's trying to bring us to the place
[1:34:16] for us to trust him
[1:34:23] for us
[1:34:25] for for for mortals
[1:34:27] men like we are we we know ourselves
[1:34:30] we know our failures
[1:34:34] but can we trust him
[1:34:38] praise the lord
[1:34:46] are we together
[1:34:50] so we have a responsibility on our hands
[1:34:53] let's let's just read some few things
[1:34:54] tonight
[1:34:56] yeah
[1:34:58] as i try to
[1:35:00] uh
[1:35:02] capture you a little bit into
[1:35:05] into
[1:35:12] total deliverance listening to this
[1:35:14] brother burnham says i wonder
[1:35:17] he said this morning it was a morning
[1:35:19] message but uh
[1:35:20] this is evening
[1:35:22] as christians
[1:35:25] if if we have yelled ourself
[1:35:28] now if you go back and study
[1:35:31] and look at the word yield
[1:35:34] it all goes to trust
[1:35:38] for you to yield yourself is to trust
[1:35:41] yourself in the hands of god
[1:35:44] if if if we have heal our own will
[1:35:48] and yield ourselves so completely to god
[1:35:51] tell god can trust us
[1:35:56] trust us the place that he has put us
[1:36:01] can god trust us to the place where he
[1:36:04] has put us
[1:36:06] sure
[1:36:08] praise the lord
[1:36:10] most of the time when we look at this
[1:36:13] we look at it with the thought of
[1:36:17] just
[1:36:18] church and position in church no
[1:36:25] your place in the family
[1:36:29] your place at work
[1:36:34] amen
[1:36:36] the it that he caused you to move tall
[1:36:48] i wonder this morning
[1:36:50] of myself if i could be so headed to god
[1:36:53] till god could trust me
[1:36:56] who trusts brother neville
[1:36:59] could trust our trusty board
[1:37:02] our deacon board
[1:37:05] all our members of our church
[1:37:09] we all have a place
[1:37:12] and we got a duty
[1:37:16] praise the lord
[1:37:18] the minister has got a place of duty to
[1:37:21] stand and preach the unsociable riches
[1:37:24] of christ without compromising
[1:37:27] if he is called to be a preacher
[1:37:30] praise the lord
[1:37:32] he wouldn't share one thing
[1:37:37] or spare one thing sorry
[1:37:39] for one person if he's called to be a
[1:37:42] preacher
[1:37:43] and the and the member of the church
[1:37:46] he's called to be a member
[1:37:49] of a setting group
[1:37:52] then
[1:37:53] he will not compromise
[1:37:55] if the church believed that we should
[1:37:57] not gamble
[1:38:00] then
[1:38:01] then that member should never touch a
[1:38:03] deck of cards
[1:38:07] we don't believe in drinking
[1:38:11] we should turn our hair completely from
[1:38:14] drinking
[1:38:16] if we do not believe in gambling or
[1:38:18] smoking the member of the church should
[1:38:21] never touch such a thing god gave
[1:38:24] complete deliverance
[1:38:29] praise the lord
[1:38:30] amen so almost in one sense he's also
[1:38:34] bringing us to the place to for us to be
[1:38:36] able to to realize the other
[1:38:42] he's he's he's trusting that his work
[1:38:45] can bring us to this place
[1:38:47] his word can bring us to this tender
[1:38:50] sure
[1:38:51] praise the lord
[1:38:53] because he said in his word he's going
[1:38:55] to get a bride with a spot or wrinkle
[1:38:58] he's not depending on our ability
[1:39:02] no perfect strength perfect weakness
[1:39:04] brother branham says is the other way
[1:39:06] around we must be depending on his
[1:39:08] ability
[1:39:10] not on our own ability
[1:39:19] he would do it if we will completely
[1:39:22] surround ourselves to him if we were
[1:39:24] completely deliver ourselves into his
[1:39:27] hands then god can
[1:39:29] live in us christ the hope of glory
[1:39:33] he can reflect himself the same word
[1:39:37] declared
[1:39:41] declare himself
[1:39:43] from us as uh as we get as we get
[1:39:47] ourself out of the way
[1:39:50] praise the lord
[1:39:52] amen
[1:39:57] ever pressing water from the rock as as
[1:40:00] we march lord
[1:40:02] we know that the smitten rock is right
[1:40:05] along
[1:40:07] in by us the ever-pressing water from
[1:40:10] the right goes with the church
[1:40:14] all intent of god
[1:40:16] lose to us
[1:40:19] this morning or this evening
[1:40:21] faith
[1:40:22] in this god
[1:40:24] that's with us
[1:40:26] brother branham says lose to us
[1:40:30] that's where the church needs to come to
[1:40:32] rise up to that place
[1:40:35] i mean as soon as little things start to
[1:40:37] happen to us in that we get so afraid
[1:40:43] we get so afraid
[1:40:48] he says i will never leave you
[1:40:50] i will never forsake you
[1:40:54] what is he trying to do to bring us to
[1:40:56] the consciousness of the ever-present
[1:40:59] god
[1:41:04] that's when the miraculous happen for
[1:41:06] you to be conscious that god is ever
[1:41:09] present
[1:41:11] whatever situation you are in to just
[1:41:13] realize
[1:41:16] that you are in the presence of the
[1:41:18] ever-present god
[1:41:20] he promised that he will never leave you
[1:41:23] lose to us faith in god
[1:41:26] that's with us i know you will
[1:41:29] just as we can find favor with you that
[1:41:32] you can trust us with it
[1:41:36] trusting us with that faith
[1:41:40] praise the lord
[1:41:44] god is trusting you and myself
[1:41:48] with a faith to believe
[1:41:50] his ever present
[1:41:53] when the word and a religious word
[1:41:56] is worshiping a god that is distance
[1:41:58] they always talk about a god that is in
[1:42:00] heaven
[1:42:02] you must be talking about a god that is
[1:42:04] right here
[1:42:06] he's right here right now
[1:42:12] praise the lord
[1:42:15] god is trusting you with that faith
[1:42:19] he's losing it to you
[1:42:22] praise the lord
[1:42:31] it's not the wind blowing and the trees
[1:42:34] dropping over your house and then you
[1:42:36] start thinking all sorts of things in
[1:42:37] your head
[1:42:39] they are climbing over my house
[1:42:44] but i mean even if they are claiming god
[1:42:46] is ever present he's right there
[1:42:52] he's releasing their faith to you to
[1:42:56] believe in the ever-present god
[1:43:04] he's trusting us
[1:43:17] he said as i was i was
[1:43:21] speaking
[1:43:23] and i i i said something so i uh
[1:43:26] studying when i came across this it was
[1:43:28] it was very interesting he says yeah
[1:43:30] he's talking dead in the church others
[1:43:31] he says we do find there's a lot of
[1:43:34] impersonation of spiritual gift
[1:43:38] but i don't believe
[1:43:42] that
[1:43:43] that's so here in our church
[1:43:46] i'm thankful for that
[1:43:48] we don't believe
[1:43:50] in an impersonation at all
[1:43:53] i believe we have genuine gift but
[1:43:56] we must know how to control those gifts
[1:44:03] praise the lord
[1:44:05] we must know how to control those gifts
[1:44:07] and many times people
[1:44:09] struggle
[1:44:12] you know people struggle people that are
[1:44:14] that are blessed with gifts and and
[1:44:16] where
[1:44:17] people struggle is when we think when we
[1:44:21] when we ever get in our mind that our
[1:44:23] gift is is superior than the word
[1:44:29] if you keep your gift under the word yes
[1:44:31] sir
[1:44:33] and you always check it with the word
[1:44:36] yes
[1:44:37] absolutely
[1:44:38] praise the lord
[1:44:40] because there there are some people uh
[1:44:42] and and and and i mean god has blessed
[1:44:45] us with many of many of the of that in
[1:44:47] this church it's just that we have not
[1:44:51] tried to major on it
[1:44:55] amen
[1:44:56] we have not tried to measure on it
[1:44:58] but
[1:45:00] most of the time when when when people
[1:45:03] try to major on gifts that's when the
[1:45:05] gift starts to detect to the word
[1:45:12] you know it starts to detach to the word
[1:45:14] what does that mean it means that a
[1:45:16] person get a vision and pretty soon now
[1:45:19] it gave me an inspiration to start
[1:45:21] preaching
[1:45:22] there are people in this church that are
[1:45:24] doing this that are doing that well now
[1:45:26] that gift is dictating to me
[1:45:38] but it can be used the right way and
[1:45:40] when you when when you go to doing
[1:45:44] something good just just like you are
[1:45:46] working for a bus
[1:45:49] in in in you and you started out
[1:45:53] on the first of your job and you are
[1:45:56] willing to take others
[1:45:58] then the boss have confidence in you
[1:46:02] and will keep raising you up
[1:46:05] to a higher office
[1:46:08] all the time now brother brennan is
[1:46:11] talking about spiritual gifts here but
[1:46:13] then he's also bringing a scenario
[1:46:17] of your boss
[1:46:19] having confidence in you your boss now
[1:46:22] starts to trust you
[1:46:24] that now he can raise you to a higher
[1:46:26] office
[1:46:27] and that is the same way that that god
[1:46:30] deals with us that's what he's bringing
[1:46:32] here now i believe that time
[1:46:38] time has struck the branham tabernacle
[1:46:40] to know
[1:46:42] to to take the gift of god to take the
[1:46:44] gift that god gave us
[1:46:46] that god can trust us with something
[1:46:50] even greater
[1:46:53] then what we have got
[1:46:56] right
[1:46:57] now so when these things were
[1:46:58] manifesting around brother branham being
[1:47:00] a prophet he started observing them you
[1:47:03] know he started seeing those men uh
[1:47:06] there was a time where he even had to
[1:47:07] talk to brother neville and says the
[1:47:09] people are putting too much pressure on
[1:47:11] you brother and evil
[1:47:12] and pretty soon you are giving in to
[1:47:14] always give them an answer he said you
[1:47:17] don't have to do that there was another
[1:47:19] time he was away and a child died in
[1:47:21] tabernacle those brothers would give
[1:47:23] came around they prayed and the child
[1:47:26] came back to life
[1:47:29] so you see it it's all that sense of
[1:47:32] growth
[1:47:34] but it all comes from harmony
[1:47:38] they sing a ministry
[1:47:42] with discernment and ministry of the
[1:47:44] praying for the sake and identifying it
[1:47:47] that is from god they can come under
[1:47:50] that ministry as children and starts to
[1:47:52] learn
[1:47:55] praise the lord
[1:47:58] they can come honor that ministry as
[1:48:00] children
[1:48:02] and starts to learn
[1:48:07] he says god can trust us
[1:48:11] with greater things
[1:48:13] if we manage and respect the little
[1:48:16] things that we have
[1:48:18] praise the lord
[1:48:19] and then just like we talk about gifts
[1:48:22] we'll also talk about the offices of the
[1:48:26] local church
[1:48:28] praise the lord
[1:48:30] and all of those things because uh is is
[1:48:32] the responsibility that god is is giving
[1:48:35] to us
[1:48:36] as a church
[1:48:39] i know some people that have uh have in
[1:48:42] their mind i mean it's just only the
[1:48:44] pastor that you are answerable to you
[1:48:46] are completely wrong
[1:48:52] you are completely wrong
[1:48:56] if there's a brother that is taking an
[1:48:58] office in this church
[1:49:01] we as a church voted him
[1:49:05] into office
[1:49:08] and that's the reason why we bowed our
[1:49:11] heads and we asked is there anyone
[1:49:14] that have any reason
[1:49:20] praise the lord
[1:49:26] and if you don't know
[1:49:28] uh uh uh
[1:49:31] i mean the 99 can vote for that brother
[1:49:34] but if there is one or two person we
[1:49:37] still like to know why
[1:49:40] and sometimes we talk
[1:49:44] because maybe the 99 don't know that
[1:49:47] sure
[1:49:52] are we together
[1:49:55] now so you see all of these things so uh
[1:49:57] i'm just only saying that
[1:49:59] you know uh uh uh because i mean we uh
[1:50:03] we uh we are where we are and we are
[1:50:06] trusting the lord to take us to where he
[1:50:08] want us to be
[1:50:12] and we have to realize that
[1:50:15] god is training us brother branham says
[1:50:17] in the message adoption the same series
[1:50:19] we're talking about he said god knows
[1:50:23] his trust in job he was talking about
[1:50:26] job
[1:50:28] god knows how much he can trust you
[1:50:32] he knows how much he can trust me
[1:50:37] praise the lord
[1:50:39] he says but what i'm speaking of now is
[1:50:41] placing of sons
[1:50:44] so it's all on trust
[1:50:47] is the father trusting the son to
[1:50:50] positionally give him an inheritance
[1:50:53] is the son also trusting the ability you
[1:50:57] are not trusting what the father has
[1:50:59] placed in your hands but you are
[1:51:01] trusting the ability of the father
[1:51:03] that's why the practical son could come
[1:51:05] back home
[1:51:06] even though he lost everything
[1:51:09] the father had given him
[1:51:11] but the ability to always be a son to
[1:51:14] the father he did not lost
[1:51:26] adoption he said how was our inheritance
[1:51:29] given to us
[1:51:31] through what predestination
[1:51:33] predestination is full knowledge how did
[1:51:36] god know
[1:51:38] he could trust you
[1:51:40] to be a preacher
[1:51:42] his full knowledge
[1:51:46] so it is not from an act that you did
[1:51:48] before he started trusting you
[1:51:53] he trust goes back
[1:51:56] it's not that you did something
[1:51:59] no he trust goes back
[1:52:03] that before you were even born
[1:52:07] he trusted you
[1:52:11] and this god that trusted you before you
[1:52:14] were even born right
[1:52:18] you mean he trusted you when he knew
[1:52:19] that you would fail
[1:52:22] he still trusted you
[1:52:24] when he knew you will fail
[1:52:29] praise the lord
[1:52:30] so if there is any good that will come
[1:52:32] out of or why can't we trust him
[1:52:35] why can't we just trust him
[1:52:42] like that lady says i trusted the lord
[1:52:44] until the last cut brother and said no
[1:52:46] you got it wrong
[1:52:48] you have something you are holding on to
[1:52:53] you should have trusted god after a
[1:52:55] court yes
[1:52:58] many of us we have things that we are
[1:53:00] holding on to we hold on to church
[1:53:02] membership we hold on to how long we've
[1:53:04] been in the message we hold on to all of
[1:53:06] these things
[1:53:12] yes sir
[1:53:17] can we trust god
[1:53:21] can we trust god can we let go
[1:53:24] and let god have his way
[1:53:30] can we let go and let god have his way
[1:53:36] i mean all of all of this is coming down
[1:53:39] to days
[1:53:41] all of the things that is happening
[1:53:46] in the world all the things that is
[1:53:47] happening around the message and all the
[1:53:50] things that it's all coming down to this
[1:54:01] can we trust god
[1:54:09] are we looking to the ability of the
[1:54:11] father
[1:54:13] for the spouses that he gave us
[1:54:17] are we looking to the ability of the
[1:54:19] father
[1:54:21] for the parents that he gave us
[1:54:24] are we looking to the ability of the
[1:54:25] father for the children that he gave us
[1:54:29] or are we trusting
[1:54:31] our skill of
[1:54:33] raising children
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:40] are we trusting our ability of of
[1:54:43] fracturing our wives
[1:54:46] or making our husband the way we want
[1:54:48] him to be
[1:54:51] it all comes down to this that's not you
[1:54:54] know i'm i'm just i'm just kind of
[1:54:56] struggling with my work i don't want to
[1:54:57] get into emotion tonight i want you to
[1:55:00] see it
[1:55:01] i want you to see what we drive into
[1:55:08] i want you to see what we're driving
[1:55:10] toward
[1:55:12] it's for it's for you
[1:55:15] as a son of god as a daughter of god
[1:55:18] completely surrounding yielding yourself
[1:55:20] to god it does not mean that you will
[1:55:23] not have tried you will not have my
[1:55:25] battle but if if if you are in that
[1:55:28] mindset whether why you trust god
[1:55:32] even the time of the stronger pressure
[1:55:35] on you
[1:55:36] you say lord into your hands i commit my
[1:55:39] spirit
[1:55:46] and see how god will lift you out of
[1:55:48] that
[1:55:55] praise the lord
[1:55:58] the same god i kept down here in the
[1:56:00] lion's den
[1:56:03] that kept daniel alive before living
[1:56:06] lions he can keep you alive in the midst
[1:56:09] of spiritual alliance
[1:56:11] because the devil is a rolling lion
[1:56:13] seeking for whom to devolve
[1:56:16] and the spiritual lion is more dangerous
[1:56:18] than the physical lion
[1:56:24] the same god i took shadrach meshach and
[1:56:26] abednego through the fire
[1:56:29] they trusted god they did not they then
[1:56:31] a figure and calculated
[1:56:34] how it would end
[1:56:37] because they were not going to calculate
[1:56:40] they said king even if he don't deliver
[1:56:42] us
[1:56:45] even if he don't deliver us
[1:56:54] can we trust god
[1:56:59] we have taken too many things in our
[1:57:01] hands
[1:57:04] too many things in our hands
[1:57:09] praise the lord
[1:57:10] and most of the time we mess it up
[1:57:12] before we want to give it to god
[1:57:14] and it's not that he can't fix it
[1:57:17] but because we have messed it up we
[1:57:19] struggle with the thought that is it's
[1:57:21] poor already right
[1:57:24] we struggle with that thought that is
[1:57:26] poor so we're not even believing in in
[1:57:29] the confidence that god is able to to
[1:57:32] make a a an eden out of a chaos
[1:57:35] situation
[1:57:38] right
[1:57:57] the harmony
[1:57:59] existed between the father
[1:58:01] and the son
[1:58:04] will be the same that we exist between
[1:58:06] christ and the bride
[1:58:09] amen
[1:58:14] the purpose of the son was to declare
[1:58:16] the father
[1:58:20] praise the lord
[1:58:23] the purpose of the first son
[1:58:26] was to declare the father and that's the
[1:58:28] purpose of every son
[1:58:30] every son is not only in the sense of
[1:58:33] the male gender
[1:58:37] for every son in the sense of every
[1:58:39] child of god
[1:58:42] what we are called to
[1:58:44] is to declare the father
[1:58:46] yes
[1:58:50] is to declare the father
[1:58:55] and the father
[1:59:00] is
[1:59:01] putting us through
[1:59:03] different things
[1:59:05] there was there were there were two
[1:59:06] things that brother brandon brought out
[1:59:08] i will take that on sunday so we can we
[1:59:11] can look at this look at this again
[1:59:13] because you know i'm
[1:59:15] like i said i want you to be able to see
[1:59:18] the picture
[1:59:20] of what we uh
[1:59:22] we are we are
[1:59:24] trying to bring to you
[1:59:27] praise the lord
[1:59:29] amen
[1:59:30] i believe we are in in the time you know
[1:59:32] like brother brahm says where where the
[1:59:34] church the church in general
[1:59:37] is is is facing treacherous water
[1:59:41] right
[1:59:47] okay there are things that will happen
[1:59:49] things that will that will uh uh
[1:59:52] you know uh
[1:59:54] will come our way that we will be
[1:59:56] exposed to and all of that
[1:59:58] but can we still trust god
[2:00:02] can we still trust and believe that god
[2:00:04] sent a prophet
[2:00:09] you know as i keep staring on this i was
[2:00:12] looking at also the songs of the prophet
[2:00:16] you know that that came up in the time
[2:00:18] of elijah a group of men that were
[2:00:20] called the sons of the prophet
[2:00:22] but they had no no regard for the
[2:00:24] prophet elijah
[2:00:26] so
[2:00:27] so who sounds the way
[2:00:31] where did they get their title from sure
[2:00:38] we'll look at that as as we look at this
[2:00:41] but uh you you have to you have to
[2:00:43] realize that
[2:00:46] you know
[2:00:47] and just like timothy had
[2:00:49] i mean paul had timidity as a son you
[2:00:52] also realize that he referred to titus
[2:00:54] as a son
[2:00:57] so it was not just one man so there is
[2:01:00] not one man that is a son to the prophet
[2:01:04] brother bran no is the ministry
[2:01:10] is the faithful fightful ministry
[2:01:13] that will rightly
[2:01:15] divide the world of truth that would be
[2:01:16] submissive to what the prophet said
[2:01:20] amen
[2:01:21] the fightful ministry that will find the
[2:01:23] importance to say what the prophet have
[2:01:26] said
[2:01:34] that's the son that's the place of the
[2:01:37] sun
[2:01:38] right
[2:01:42] praise the lord
[2:01:45] that's the place of the sun
[2:01:50] it's it's very amazing when you study
[2:01:52] the scripture
[2:01:55] you study the scripture you realize that
[2:01:57] uh
[2:01:58] paul he rebuked
[2:02:00] the the jewish brethren's natural not to
[2:02:02] pressure
[2:02:03] not to pressure the gentile people that
[2:02:06] are being safe
[2:02:07] you know into the covenant of
[2:02:09] circumcision and all of that
[2:02:12] but you know what he did
[2:02:16] he taught he told titus
[2:02:24] he told titus to obey them
[2:02:29] why because titus was now going to be a
[2:02:32] pastor
[2:02:33] of a jewish church
[2:02:38] it's right in the scripture sure
[2:02:44] now he's the prophet of the age
[2:02:47] you you you say you say wow
[2:02:59] that's the reason why brother brandon
[2:03:00] consists i preach why paul preached
[2:03:08] if you can see it and understand it in
[2:03:10] the alpha ministry you will not struggle
[2:03:12] with it in the in the omega ministry
[2:03:14] sure
[2:03:16] because that's how god works
[2:03:21] what you see is to be able to trust the
[2:03:24] son that god has raised in the age
[2:03:27] right
[2:03:31] think about it jesus
[2:03:34] the son of god
[2:03:36] a virgin shall conceive
[2:03:42] he was raised he was raised upon
[2:03:44] uh uh uh and and then he was there i
[2:03:47] mean he uh he he opened the blind eye
[2:03:49] said you know what what do men say is
[2:03:51] that i the son of man and everybody
[2:03:53] standing
[2:03:55] peter honor inspiration thou art christ
[2:03:57] son of the living god
[2:04:00] you realize that all during his ethnic
[2:04:03] ministry they really struggle
[2:04:07] to accept who he was
[2:04:12] they came to conviction after his
[2:04:15] resurrection
[2:04:25] he was raised in the dead he was healing
[2:04:27] the sick all of that he was doing the
[2:04:29] year as they walk with him
[2:04:32] and all the things that they saw they
[2:04:34] still struggle
[2:04:38] to believe and accept who he was
[2:04:45] after he was crucified they all went
[2:04:47] back to their tents
[2:04:49] went back to fishing and everything
[2:04:54] but when he resurrected
[2:04:56] now they could go to an upper room
[2:04:59] to go and wait for the holy ghost
[2:05:06] praise the lord
[2:05:10] god have a purpose
[2:05:12] of raising a son in this age
[2:05:17] the son of man ministry
[2:05:22] the son of man being revealed
[2:05:28] praise the lord
[2:05:29] that is the place that brings
[2:05:32] the church that is the place that brings
[2:05:34] the
[2:05:35] the the bride the people that are caught
[2:05:37] up under that ministry
[2:05:47] because he's the son
[2:05:49] just as god deals with their son
[2:05:54] the word that he gave us now can have a
[2:05:56] preeminence
[2:05:59] he can say just like paul said
[2:06:02] the things that you have seen in me
[2:06:05] the things you have received
[2:06:08] the things you have learned of me
[2:06:12] do
[2:06:13] and the god of peace
[2:06:20] because i mean we we at a place where
[2:06:22] there is there is just there is just so
[2:06:24] much trouble
[2:06:26] because of uh you know uh uh what others
[2:06:31] want to make of brother branham
[2:06:33] it posts orders to the place also where
[2:06:35] we become killers
[2:06:37] right
[2:06:39] and think that while we are in the
[2:06:40] message we don't need the prophet
[2:06:47] amen
[2:06:50] oh yeah we you do
[2:06:53] let me tell you you do
[2:06:56] yes because he was that wave chief
[2:07:01] the son that came to maturity
[2:07:04] so we can learn how he got there
[2:07:09] we can learn how he got there
[2:07:15] that's what we are trying to bring to
[2:07:16] you
[2:07:18] we can learn how he got there yes
[2:07:32] can you trust the ability
[2:07:34] brother branham says will god
[2:07:37] allow me to
[2:07:39] to to do all of this and mislead you
[2:07:44] can we trust the ministry of the prophet
[2:07:47] can we trust the things that he said to
[2:07:49] us
[2:07:55] amen
[2:07:56] we have to realize is this divine
[2:07:58] mysterious truth
[2:08:00] that we literally turn our heart back
[2:08:04] and if he will be able to do it we have
[2:08:06] to trust it
[2:08:07] for our heart to go back to the
[2:08:09] apostolic father we have to trust the
[2:08:12] divine mystery truth
[2:08:20] we have to have to trust the divine
[2:08:23] mystery truth that being revealed to us
[2:08:27] praise the lord so i thought that this
[2:08:30] this wednesday night i will i will just
[2:08:32] be slow i will you know
[2:08:34] you know tie my hearts down
[2:08:37] and now run over the place
[2:08:40] and just try to
[2:08:42] to recap what i've been trying to bring
[2:08:45] bring to you i know i don't have enough
[2:08:48] ability to to bring it in the best way
[2:08:51] the other people that can do better than
[2:08:52] me but i i'm trying my best anyway amen
[2:08:55] i'm trying my best anyway
[2:08:58] if that harmony issue exists
[2:09:01] if that how many you exist
[2:09:03] praise the lord
[2:09:05] that harmony
[2:09:06] he says that harmony is existing
[2:09:09] you know between the bride and christ
[2:09:12] we know it's a very important ingredient
[2:09:15] for any form of relationship
[2:09:17] right
[2:09:20] you know any form of relationship the
[2:09:22] sons of the prophet never had harmony
[2:09:26] so they had a death in the part
[2:09:30] what they were giving the people was
[2:09:31] death
[2:09:33] because they were not in harmony with
[2:09:35] the father right
[2:09:39] they were not willing to learn honor
[2:09:40] elijah
[2:09:43] ahab has already bailed
[2:09:45] a seminary for them
[2:09:50] where they were gathering and what they
[2:09:52] were doing they were reading the laws of
[2:09:54] moses
[2:09:55] yeah they were reading the laws of moses
[2:09:58] that's the reason why when uh
[2:10:00] when aha went to them and found out
[2:10:02] whether he should go to roman gillet and
[2:10:04] show him in a word that yeah it's true
[2:10:06] this place is for us
[2:10:08] right
[2:10:12] they were willing to take instruction
[2:10:14] from the lord of moses but yet they were
[2:10:16] not they were not able to identify a
[2:10:18] prophet
[2:10:20] that was in their midst
[2:10:25] they were not able to identify a prophet
[2:10:28] that was in their midst
[2:10:32] praise the lord
[2:10:35] are we together no
[2:10:38] amen
[2:10:39] yeah don't uh
[2:10:41] if you if if we're going to trust god
[2:10:44] you have you have to realize now you
[2:10:46] have to realize this is where it's very
[2:10:48] important
[2:10:49] to you for you to believe to be able to
[2:10:52] achieve a harmony
[2:10:55] between
[2:10:58] christ the bridegroom
[2:11:00] and the church as a bride
[2:11:03] you must also believe that god was able
[2:11:05] to achieve it between the father and a
[2:11:08] son in your age
[2:11:13] so to despise that and say it's uh i
