[59:28] a direct intent but just like I said we
[59:31] want to we want to I want to share
[59:33] something with you uh
[59:36] this morning after the service even
[59:39] though the Wednesday service was was
[59:41] actually
[59:42] uh a prayer meeting and and then we read
[59:46] this in John chapter 9 we spoke a little
[59:49] bit there on on on God's design and uh
[59:53] we see the disciples here trying to
[59:55] attribute this man uh
[59:58] [Music]
[59:59] sickness being born blind to to sin they
[1:00:03] are actually trying to trace it back to
[1:00:06] the the scene in Genesis uh in the
[1:00:10] beginning
[1:00:11] but then that Jesus
[1:00:15] he
[1:00:18] he actually spoke about it in another
[1:00:21] way
[1:00:22] for us to be able to appreciate the
[1:00:25] different things that we go through
[1:00:29] for us to be able to appreciate
[1:00:32] the different things that we go through
[1:00:35] to realize that there is a great
[1:00:38] intelligence
[1:00:40] there's a great intelligence behind
[1:00:44] Our Lives praise the Lord
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:48] there you there cannot be uh
[1:00:54] a design without a designer
[1:00:57] whenever you have anything that makes
[1:01:00] sense there is an intelligence behind it
[1:01:05] praise the Lord
[1:01:07] there is an intelligence behind it
[1:01:11] so for for for men uh you know the the
[1:01:14] eight years and the unbelievers that
[1:01:17] love you know a setting weather the love
[1:01:21] you know uh the mountains the love uh
[1:01:26] you cannot appreciate those things
[1:01:28] except there is a design
[1:01:32] amen and for you to appreciate the
[1:01:35] design
[1:01:36] you must also realize there's a designer
[1:01:39] that is behind every design
[1:01:42] praise the Lord
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:49] I think if you take the time to look at
[1:01:52] the tag on the clothes you are wearing
[1:01:54] maybe your designer that that face their
[1:01:58] clothes name might be on it
[1:02:00] praise the Lord
[1:02:03] and then if you made it yourself just
[1:02:05] write your name on it
[1:02:07] you are the designer praise the Lord
[1:02:09] amen
[1:02:11] so in looking at that you know I went
[1:02:14] home and and the thought was on my mind
[1:02:17] I kept thinking about it and uh
[1:02:22] so I thought I said well okay we will I
[1:02:25] will I will try to pull out something
[1:02:26] here for us to for us to look into
[1:02:31] so this morning I'm uh
[1:02:36] I'm going to take
[1:02:39] um
[1:02:40] I'm going to take the bird
[1:02:43] I'm going to take the bird
[1:02:46] and the reason why I'm going to take the
[1:02:48] bird is because
[1:02:50] from the way that the bird is designed
[1:02:55] comes our
[1:02:57] flight comes our aircraft
[1:03:01] and note of that
[1:03:03] for man to be able to build
[1:03:07] uh the plane and set it up in the air
[1:03:10] for it to be able to fly hundreds of
[1:03:14] miles and now we have even gone to the
[1:03:17] astronaut of age is because men India
[1:03:22] India intelligence try to study the bird
[1:03:28] they try to steady the bird
[1:03:32] what keeps the bird in the air or keep
[1:03:35] the bird in the way that it is
[1:03:42] praise the Lord
[1:03:48] now so uh that's a little bit of that
[1:03:52] that we want to look at but before I do
[1:03:54] that
[1:03:55] let me take something here from the
[1:03:57] message shalom
[1:03:59] just to start off
[1:04:03] praise the Lord
[1:04:06] and
[1:04:11] I was looking forward to see here
[1:04:22] okay
[1:04:25] I would I think
[1:04:28] attack people they are trying to lower
[1:04:30] my images
[1:04:35] I hope I can
[1:04:39] okay let's take let's take the this this
[1:04:42] thought here from shalom
[1:04:47] every word that he promised will be
[1:04:49] Vindicated
[1:04:52] everyone
[1:04:53] if he's able to do it today after
[1:04:57] promising a 2 000 years ago
[1:05:01] if it's a hundred thousand years from
[1:05:04] today Jesus will return to the Earth in
[1:05:08] a visible body
[1:05:11] for a church
[1:05:15] a redeemed a bride to take her out of
[1:05:18] here
[1:05:19] regardless of what comes
[1:05:22] goals faction can go on and people can
[1:05:27] wait into a total darkness and believe
[1:05:31] anything they want to believe but Jesus
[1:05:34] Christ will return again
[1:05:37] why because every word of God will be
[1:05:41] Vindicated
[1:05:43] amen if God says so it's going to happen
[1:05:48] I trust the future to him
[1:05:51] then Lord God I don't know what tomorrow
[1:05:54] holds but I Know Who Holds Tomorrow
[1:05:59] his word is just like a great Symphony
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:05] how many of you ever heard
[1:06:10] is something well everybody has some of
[1:06:13] us now remember
[1:06:16] and symphony is winning music is played
[1:06:20] in a drama now you will see why I'm
[1:06:23] going this way because there is one
[1:06:25] particular
[1:06:27] uh uh bird that has a plate in the
[1:06:31] symphony
[1:06:35] and uh
[1:06:37] I think I have it right
[1:06:41] pitted in the wolf
[1:06:43] you remember there the whole story I
[1:06:46] have heard that how they take the drum
[1:06:49] and make the little woodpecker picking
[1:06:54] and Peter's going out
[1:06:57] and a glowing the wolf and and taught in
[1:07:00] their homes aside from the nail if you
[1:07:04] don't understand a symphony it's a big
[1:07:08] bunch of Rocket to you
[1:07:11] if you don't understand it
[1:07:17] if you I mean you have got to understand
[1:07:20] what it is
[1:07:23] and it's all done by signs emotion
[1:07:29] but it's an art
[1:07:31] but it's out out a drama in a cell phone
[1:07:35] and now we know this
[1:07:38] the only one that understand the sound
[1:07:41] funny is the composer and those who are
[1:07:46] interested
[1:07:47] in knowing
[1:07:52] praise the Lord
[1:07:54] amen those who are interested in knowing
[1:07:58] nose is changes knows what take place
[1:08:03] the composer knows every move from
[1:08:08] the end to the beginning from the
[1:08:10] beginning to the end
[1:08:12] that you know there
[1:08:14] the one who wrote it up he composed this
[1:08:18] he knows every little Junction
[1:08:23] if he knows every Junction so does the
[1:08:27] director have to do to direct it amen
[1:08:31] and the composer of our life is almighty
[1:08:35] God
[1:08:35] the director is the Holy Spirit
[1:08:38] sons of God are led by the Holy Spirit
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:44] so uh
[1:08:56] okay
[1:08:58] are you ready
[1:09:00] uh but I'm I'm not seeing it on my end
[1:09:04] brother Johnny I mean brother Jordan
[1:09:11] oh let me see
[1:09:15] um
[1:09:25] is that from your end or my end
[1:09:33] okay
[1:09:34] just can you switch this picture I mean
[1:09:37] this light of
[1:09:38] okay I can just tell you which uh
[1:09:40] picture to throw up there
[1:09:45] so we we are saying the other
[1:09:50] we want to look at the design of a
[1:09:52] flight
[1:09:54] and how uh
[1:09:57] uh signs
[1:10:00] were able to study
[1:10:04] um
[1:10:04] of the bird the nature of the bird
[1:10:08] for them to be so successful in coming
[1:10:12] up with all of these superflys that we
[1:10:15] enjoy
[1:10:16] flying
[1:10:19] but then if you look at the bird in
[1:10:21] itself
[1:10:23] the bird
[1:10:25] is light Wisconsin
[1:10:28] and uh
[1:10:31] in the way that the bird is designed
[1:10:35] the birds have to lay eggs
[1:10:40] to keep its lightweight to fly
[1:10:46] praise the Lord
[1:10:48] if the bird was carrying her children
[1:10:51] like every other children or every other
[1:10:54] animal it would be too heavy
[1:10:58] so in a way that almighty God designed
[1:11:01] the bird
[1:11:02] she's designed
[1:11:04] to leg ass
[1:11:09] and uh
[1:11:12] uh I have my picture so scattered
[1:11:16] that uh
[1:11:34] let's move to the the physiologic of the
[1:11:37] bird
[1:11:39] it has a fast metabolism
[1:11:43] the bird's body temperature
[1:11:48] it keeps such a temperature more higher
[1:11:52] than the temperature we keep
[1:11:55] the birds have open ends on the two
[1:11:59] sides of his lungs for it to be able to
[1:12:02] breathe
[1:12:04] and it briefs
[1:12:08] 400
[1:12:11] for 450 births a meaning
[1:12:15] while we do 30.
[1:12:18] a meaning
[1:12:21] it has a long height
[1:12:23] for attitude
[1:12:27] I'll run through this very fast
[1:12:30] to just get to where I want to get to
[1:12:34] um
[1:12:39] okay
[1:12:41] then you can
[1:12:45] let's look at the beach
[1:12:47] choose the peaks of the birds the birds
[1:12:50] have different beaks
[1:12:53] the I actually use this this one is uh
[1:12:58] the bakes for those birds like Castro
[1:13:02] Eagles the ones that can tear flesh
[1:13:04] apart
[1:13:08] and this beak is for
[1:13:12] birds like flamingo
[1:13:15] and they are able to feel for things you
[1:13:19] know the the big has a filtering system
[1:13:22] they can go there and filter things
[1:13:24] through their mouth while they eat
[1:13:27] and uh
[1:13:30] uh
[1:13:34] this sharp one is uh for the Cuda those
[1:13:38] ones that can be able to get worms
[1:13:40] they're able to take things off the show
[1:13:42] dig in the earth and be able to get food
[1:13:45] to eat
[1:13:47] this one is our parents and uh cocktails
[1:13:52] and all of that is for is for the ones
[1:13:54] that that are able to break nuts you
[1:13:59] know be able to break nuts
[1:14:01] and these are all God's design
[1:14:04] and girls designed them
[1:14:07] for a purpose
[1:14:09] praise the Lord
[1:14:13] let's look at the feathers
[1:14:19] the feathers and their feet verse all of
[1:14:23] these birds they have different feet and
[1:14:25] for different reasons and they also have
[1:14:28] different feathers
[1:14:30] Loki are the feet and the feathers will
[1:14:33] make us to look at one of our
[1:14:39] one of the birds we want to look at is
[1:14:42] the woodpecker
[1:14:44] you know birdram talks about a
[1:14:46] woodpecker in that message and how uh
[1:14:50] Peter and a wolf sound funny is made
[1:14:52] with the sound of the Woodpecker like
[1:14:55] the Wood Pecker picking so let's look at
[1:14:58] the Woodpecker for a while yeah
[1:15:03] it has a strong beak
[1:15:06] it has a very strong beak
[1:15:12] and it says that the woodpecker
[1:15:17] is is one of the birds that have one of
[1:15:20] the most strongest big because of what
[1:15:23] it does
[1:15:24] but then in picking on the world
[1:15:28] that bird has to close his eyes
[1:15:32] and it's uh because if it done
[1:15:36] your eyes will fall out
[1:15:39] because of the way it Peaks
[1:15:44] and it has a spectral cartridge that
[1:15:47] that support
[1:15:49] the weight
[1:15:52] is almost like your shock absorbed on
[1:15:55] your vehicle
[1:15:57] so when it hitting that wood it has you
[1:16:01] know a special country there that that
[1:16:04] holds the you know the
[1:16:07] yeah and then it also it also goes home
[1:16:11] without an headache
[1:16:15] praise the Lord is built to be able to
[1:16:18] support
[1:16:19] the you know uh their their hating and
[1:16:23] breaking into the wood into the trade
[1:16:26] and uh that it goes home without a
[1:16:29] headache
[1:16:31] like every other birds they have
[1:16:34] three toes in front and one behind the
[1:16:38] Woodpecker have two in front and two
[1:16:40] behind
[1:16:42] and uh the the tail feather is also used
[1:16:47] for it to be able to get his grip that
[1:16:50] when it's it's kneeling is kneeling
[1:16:57] praise the Lord
[1:16:59] and all of that is God's design
[1:17:03] this never came from a Big Bang Theory
[1:17:09] this came from an intelligence
[1:17:17] praise the Lord
[1:17:24] and uh
[1:17:26] the the
[1:17:29] Woodpecker has a tongue that is longer
[1:17:32] than the beak
[1:17:34] because after it has picked into the
[1:17:36] wood it used his tongue to go in and get
[1:17:41] whatever it want to get from in the tree
[1:17:45] and so it has a tongue that is longer
[1:17:49] than the big
[1:17:52] praise the Lord
[1:18:00] it says that the European green wood uh
[1:18:05] pecker tongue
[1:18:08] is down the throat it's out
[1:18:11] the back of the neck
[1:18:13] around the back of the the skull uh
[1:18:17] beneath the skin
[1:18:19] and over the top uh between their eyes
[1:18:25] and determine it just below
[1:18:27] the eye socket
[1:18:33] and another thing there
[1:18:36] with the birds
[1:18:39] let's look at the migration
[1:18:41] we soon close on this
[1:18:46] the migration of birds
[1:18:50] is still a mystery
[1:18:53] how birds travel how they migrate
[1:18:58] is still a mystery
[1:19:01] praise the Lord
[1:19:04] it holds a mystery of how we will get
[1:19:07] out of here
[1:19:11] the way birds travel
[1:19:13] stay a mystery
[1:19:17] and there is one bird
[1:19:22] there is one bird
[1:19:25] that uh we will take account of
[1:19:29] is called the galling Clover
[1:19:34] it's a Siberian clover
[1:19:37] this bird
[1:19:39] it's a small bird like death
[1:19:43] small duck bird
[1:19:46] but this bird
[1:19:48] or birds can travel generally
[1:19:53] about uh 25
[1:19:55] 000 mice
[1:19:58] from birth to their destination
[1:20:03] after a bird you know has been let out
[1:20:07] of the net you know when uh when the
[1:20:10] mother you know shattered the nerd as
[1:20:13] smart as they are they can be able to
[1:20:15] get in the comfort when birds are
[1:20:17] migrating they can go as far as 25
[1:20:22] 000 mice
[1:20:26] but this bird that we are talking about
[1:20:28] um if you scroll down I have a picture
[1:20:30] of it it's a small black bird okay right
[1:20:33] there
[1:20:34] this bird
[1:20:37] it says to be it has a it has a special
[1:20:40] flight route it leads from Alaska to
[1:20:44] uh why
[1:20:47] it goes
[1:20:53] and a travel
[1:20:57] with no rest stop
[1:21:01] when he's on his
[1:21:03] Journey
[1:21:05] praise the Lord
[1:21:07] normally it waits
[1:21:10] 130 grams
[1:21:17] and it can
[1:21:19] flap its wings on that trip
[1:21:22] quarter of a million wins flop
[1:21:30] it travels
[1:21:32] to be able to leave from Alaska
[1:21:35] and get to Ohio is a travel
[1:21:39] uh 88 hours
[1:21:45] 88 hours traveling
[1:21:50] with no rest stop
[1:21:52] so which means it has to take in enough
[1:21:55] deal
[1:21:56] if you if you want to think it in in a
[1:21:58] line of flight it has to build itself up
[1:22:01] so what it does is the other
[1:22:04] uh it increases its weight
[1:22:11] is normally 830 grams it adds about 70
[1:22:15] grain to its weight just to be able to
[1:22:18] sustain it for it to go
[1:22:21] but then they say is that
[1:22:23] wave the the traveling of of the bird
[1:22:31] the bird has to use a setting flying
[1:22:35] formation
[1:22:36] to be able to achieve that or as they
[1:22:39] will crash
[1:22:41] after 75 hours
[1:22:46] so the birds
[1:22:48] that's the reason why the fly
[1:22:50] information
[1:22:53] and what they do is that
[1:22:57] that is that is one of the place that
[1:22:59] just that that you know that just struck
[1:23:02] me in this
[1:23:04] as the birds travel in formation
[1:23:13] they can trace parts
[1:23:18] amen and that's what sustained him
[1:23:21] because is is the lead that those a lot
[1:23:26] of the flapping
[1:23:28] while the others set their wings and
[1:23:32] turn like this and turn like this
[1:23:35] so they got to change their formation
[1:23:37] and somewhere else take the lead to do
[1:23:39] the flopping while the other rest
[1:23:42] and they just go like this and go like
[1:23:44] this that's why birds travel information
[1:23:50] praise the Lord
[1:23:53] and uh and when you just you just think
[1:23:56] about this I mean there are just a lot
[1:23:58] of there but uh uh I mean this this is
[1:24:02] uh enough for our presentation this
[1:24:04] morning
[1:24:05] but if you just think about it
[1:24:08] thy God in his you know in his Sovereign
[1:24:12] mind
[1:24:13] will be able to design
[1:24:17] those creatures and they can travel
[1:24:20] uh you know the different places in the
[1:24:24] changes of weather and not of that
[1:24:28] with their youngs and you know they can
[1:24:31] migrate in their way
[1:24:33] if you just think about it
[1:24:35] you'll realize that
[1:24:38] that is just like us
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:44] that is just like us
[1:24:47] we cannot make it alone
[1:24:54] we cannot make it alone
[1:24:57] that's why we
[1:25:00] we we have to have Fellowship
[1:25:03] the scripture says do not forsake the
[1:25:05] assembling of the sins
[1:25:08] when it's necessary amen
[1:25:13] it is because
[1:25:16] that as we as we gather as we come into
[1:25:20] the building and We Gather here then we
[1:25:24] and we take our formation the the
[1:25:26] musician come for the song leader come
[1:25:29] for the technicians are back there and
[1:25:32] you know we take our different uh
[1:25:34] positions the worshiper sits down we
[1:25:37] prayed and all of that in their
[1:25:40] formation
[1:25:43] every one of us is just like uh uh the
[1:25:49] the drafting of houses or hearses and
[1:25:52] all the drafting of race car
[1:25:54] in that formation every one of us we
[1:25:58] bring
[1:26:00] a little special gift that God has given
[1:26:03] us
[1:26:05] that brings energy to the body
[1:26:09] praise the Lord
[1:26:11] amen
[1:26:13] and you see in as much as with with time
[1:26:17] and uh and and and different ones work
[1:26:21] schedule and the different things that
[1:26:22] happen around our life uh the Lord has
[1:26:25] blessed us with an age where we can be
[1:26:28] able to stream service from home and all
[1:26:31] of those things but what is happening
[1:26:33] there is there there if you are not
[1:26:36] exercising your gift
[1:26:39] you are defrauding the body
[1:26:44] okay so it is it is in a place like uh
[1:26:48] uh you know uh I mean uh
[1:26:50] [Music]
[1:26:52] even even the the very special way that
[1:26:57] sometimes setting people respond to the
[1:27:00] word
[1:27:03] amen just that little
[1:27:06] there are little expression when the
[1:27:09] word means something to you
[1:27:11] and you say Amen oh you said that's
[1:27:14] right
[1:27:16] it brings some energy
[1:27:22] that's why we are not crushing in our
[1:27:24] flight
[1:27:27] praise the Lord
[1:27:29] is gross design
[1:27:34] it's God's design
[1:27:36] the word minister to us it reaches Us in
[1:27:42] different areas
[1:27:45] a quick seven things to you
[1:27:49] in a different way
[1:27:53] are we together
[1:27:55] and it's it's it's all of those things
[1:27:58] that's that's what I've always believed
[1:28:00] that the scripture called the beauty of
[1:28:03] holiness
[1:28:04] if it's all of those things
[1:28:07] that that comes together
[1:28:10] that gave strength to our traveling amen
[1:28:15] so you see the uh whatever we can do
[1:28:19] unless is is far beyond you know us by
[1:28:22] weather or the uh certain situation it
[1:28:27] is always a blessing
[1:28:31] together together
[1:28:34] amen because a single bird a single
[1:28:39] Siberian clover will never be able to
[1:28:42] make that Journey
[1:28:51] birds do not migrate alone
[1:28:57] because
[1:28:59] the use
[1:29:01] their their formation
[1:29:03] to be able to sustain themselves
[1:29:06] as they travel
[1:29:13] praise the Lord
[1:29:16] who tell them when to go
[1:29:20] amen what is the GPS they are using
[1:29:29] which Highway do they travel on
[1:29:33] how do they tell that storm is not
[1:29:36] coming their way
[1:29:43] there is an intelligence
[1:29:49] that guide him
[1:29:51] praise the Lord
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:58] so let's read this also from a true sign
[1:30:01] overlook
[1:30:03] but look
[1:30:04] you are spending your life trying to
[1:30:07] find something on a creation
[1:30:14] when I was just having a conversation
[1:30:16] here with a doctor
[1:30:17] when he made that statement
[1:30:20] you know he was talking to the doctor
[1:30:22] and appreciating the doctor for the the
[1:30:25] ways Medical Science have advanced and
[1:30:27] all the things that they are doing you
[1:30:30] know and what a blessing but then he's
[1:30:31] also trying to make him to realize this
[1:30:35] you're spending your time
[1:30:37] of your life trying to find something on
[1:30:40] a creation but why not sometimes think
[1:30:43] who created it
[1:30:46] who made it
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] who's the designer
[1:30:52] of eight God is the designer of it
[1:30:58] how much greater is the creator than the
[1:31:02] creation that he have made
[1:31:05] why do we put so much emphasis on the
[1:31:09] creation
[1:31:10] when we don't think about the Creator
[1:31:13] who made the Heaven and the Earth
[1:31:16] and made the body and life and can
[1:31:20] destroy it anytime he desires because
[1:31:24] it's his and no one can ask him a
[1:31:27] question
[1:31:31] this become a very wonderful thing
[1:31:36] to work on the human body we appreciate
[1:31:39] that
[1:31:40] they can transfer an eye from one man to
[1:31:45] another
[1:31:47] they take those tiny little calls and
[1:31:50] and uh and and take an eye out of a
[1:31:54] man's socket and place it over in
[1:31:56] another man's socket and that man can
[1:31:59] see from that eye that is a wonderful
[1:32:02] thing
[1:32:06] you stop up a valve out here we have a
[1:32:10] gas something right down there think
[1:32:13] about stopping the valve and you know
[1:32:15] Broadband also talk about you know uh
[1:32:18] stop about out here somewhere of this
[1:32:21] water system in the in the city and
[1:32:24] watch what happened at the main valve it
[1:32:28] will blow it out
[1:32:30] but yet you can cut
[1:32:34] a legs of amputate and arm
[1:32:37] and Bob the miracle of God
[1:32:42] he will bypass
[1:32:45] their blood
[1:32:48] some other way
[1:32:53] the second
[1:32:54] uh some other way the second time in raw
[1:32:58] and and rush it around some other way to
[1:33:02] save
[1:33:03] the life of the person
[1:33:07] praise the Lord
[1:33:11] you think about just getting a cut on
[1:33:14] your hand and you are bleeding
[1:33:16] you know
[1:33:18] and uh you you try to stop the blade
[1:33:25] and when the blades stop
[1:33:27] you realize that that's what blood Brown
[1:33:30] is saying here by the miracle of God
[1:33:34] uh whatever tissue that is called
[1:33:37] the blood
[1:33:39] bypassed that
[1:33:42] is not constantly bleeding because if
[1:33:44] you are just constantly bleeding you
[1:33:45] will bleed to death
[1:33:48] if God did not create it a way
[1:33:51] there are those cells or vessels who
[1:33:54] create a bypass
[1:33:56] just to keep our life the moment you get
[1:34:00] caught you will bleed till you die
[1:34:07] but what tells the blood
[1:34:10] not to go through that wound
[1:34:15] but but to start to find another Channel
[1:34:22] to Keep Us Alive what tells their blood
[1:34:30] praise the Lord
[1:34:40] and science can do well bypass surgery
[1:34:43] and all of that
[1:34:46] caught off on an archery cut off the
[1:34:50] main line out here somewhere in the
[1:34:54] water when when it's pumping from a
[1:34:57] valve what would it do try it once and
[1:35:01] find what happened
[1:35:02] there is no other way to bypass it
[1:35:06] it has to blow back to the valve if God
[1:35:10] didn't make a way for this Blood to
[1:35:14] bypass itself instantly one back up to
[1:35:19] the heart and you are dead
[1:35:23] every time you struck your finger it was
[1:35:27] deaf instantly
[1:35:29] every time you cut something or
[1:35:32] somewhere that opened up an orchard or
[1:35:35] something it will be deaf instantly
[1:35:39] praise the Lord
[1:35:43] that's all they will blow right back to
[1:35:45] your heart again and it will kill you
[1:35:49] now we we think it's wonderful
[1:35:54] it is wonderful and we appreciate how
[1:35:57] science
[1:35:58] they can tie those archers and keep them
[1:36:01] from bleeding that's all fine but who
[1:36:05] was the one who designed that
[1:36:12] see we look over the creation and forget
[1:36:16] the creator of it
[1:36:20] let's take another one here
[1:36:23] he's a designer of his word
[1:36:26] the designer of his word
[1:36:29] the man who created heaven and earth
[1:36:32] designed his church
[1:36:35] praise the Lord
[1:36:39] does he know more about what it takes
[1:36:43] for the rapture
[1:36:47] or does the church know more about what
[1:36:50] it takes
[1:36:53] he's the designer
[1:36:55] he knows what it takes
[1:36:58] he's well dressed in the power and the
[1:37:02] resurrection
[1:37:04] he's walking among us today in the power
[1:37:08] of his resurrection he knows what it
[1:37:12] takes to put a church and set it in
[1:37:15] other
[1:37:16] he designed it he put the past together
[1:37:20] here in the Bible
[1:37:23] so it does not take all our you know
[1:37:26] Bongo games and and and and all the
[1:37:29] things that we can create you know no
[1:37:32] God God already designed it
[1:37:36] praise the Lord before we got here the
[1:37:39] word was already here
[1:37:43] if he promised a Rapture he has already
[1:37:46] designed how he's going to get us out of
[1:37:49] here
[1:37:50] if he promised our healing he has
[1:37:53] already designed how to bring healing to
[1:37:56] our body
[1:37:59] praise the Lord
[1:38:00] he promised our deliverance
[1:38:04] man can have all their seven steps
[1:38:09] to getting out of addiction
[1:38:12] 12 steps and 10 steps
[1:38:16] and every time they get to the last step
[1:38:18] they fall right back down
[1:38:20] to start the steps over the game
[1:38:27] praise the Lord
[1:38:33] just let the current flow through it
[1:38:37] now watch it operates let's let faith in
[1:38:41] the promised word of today flow through
[1:38:44] it
[1:38:45] you will see how it operates
[1:38:49] amen
[1:38:50] let the word just flow
[1:38:53] in the beginning the spirit of God move
[1:38:57] and as the spirit of God move over the
[1:39:00] Earth the creation came to be
[1:39:04] let's fate just flow through the body
[1:39:06] let the people receive the word let the
[1:39:09] people believe the words
[1:39:16] the word has the power to change us
[1:39:25] left Faith in the promised word of today
[1:39:28] flow truth you will see how it operates
[1:39:32] he designed the thing he designed his
[1:39:35] church by the word man shall not live by
[1:39:39] bread alone but by every word that
[1:39:43] proceed from the mouth of God
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:47] in the midst of Darkness who's going to
[1:39:51] bring the little bra out
[1:39:53] who knows about it
[1:39:55] who can save us from the chaos that we
[1:39:58] are in
[1:40:00] praise the Lord I mean the time that we
[1:40:03] live in him and the things that is
[1:40:05] happening around us
[1:40:09] but God have it all under control
[1:40:13] praise the Lord
[1:40:15] he have it all under
[1:40:18] control
[1:40:20] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:40:22] so you see the uh uh Jesus right there
[1:40:26] said neither this man father neither his
[1:40:30] mother
[1:40:31] you know the design that he has he was
[1:40:35] designed this way
[1:40:38] to be bomb blind
[1:40:42] to this age to this time
[1:40:45] for the work of God to be May manifest
[1:40:50] praise the Lord
[1:40:52] amen whatever we are dealing with is
[1:40:55] because there's a work of God that need
[1:40:58] to be made manifest in our life there's
[1:41:02] a work of God that needs to be made
[1:41:04] manifest in our situation
[1:41:09] as much as you cannot blame it or his
[1:41:13] mother you cannot blend it to uh uh uh
[1:41:16] uh that man and and even yeah you think
[1:41:19] about it think about it
[1:41:20] Jesus never even say is the devil
[1:41:25] he said no
[1:41:28] but this man was kept like this for the
[1:41:31] work of God
[1:41:32] to be me manifest
[1:41:35] he never even said it's the devil you
[1:41:38] know and in our religious mind we will
[1:41:40] bring out all the court is the devil
[1:41:42] Genesis chapter 3 he deceived it that
[1:41:44] was sin begins
[1:41:51] praise the Lord
[1:41:54] but you see that I I choose to just go
[1:41:57] this route there a little bit because uh
[1:42:00] uh uh uh it helps to bring up that
[1:42:04] picture for us to be able to appreciate
[1:42:09] what God is doing in our lives
[1:42:14] amen there's a great intelligence
[1:42:18] behind our life

[1:42:28] that have that have that have designed
[1:42:31] us and and uh for us to be born in the
[1:42:34] family we were born the Nations we were
[1:42:36] born and and his grace can bring us
[1:42:39] together into a little body like this
[1:42:43] there's a great intelligence behind it
[1:42:48] praise the Lord
[1:42:53] and that's why we want to appreciate
[1:42:58] that's why we want to appreciate
[1:43:03] amen he have a purpose
[1:43:05] for everything our life is going through
[1:43:10] if we can just only keep the subject
[1:43:13] matter
[1:43:15] that the work of God
[1:43:16] who Bill May manifest
[1:43:19] praise the Lord
[1:43:22] amen
[1:43:23] Satan you are doing everything that you

[1:43:37] that you are called to do so the work of
[1:43:40] God will be made manifest
[1:43:44] praise the Lord
[1:43:46] Hallelujah
[1:43:47] so I pray that that the lord gave us
[1:43:50] Grace to be able to to appreciate as we
[1:43:53] go through different things in our lives
[1:43:56] and uh let's be grateful
[1:43:59] amen let's be grateful
[1:44:03] we are met
[1:44:05] our life is not controlled by uh you
[1:44:08] know but uh by a Big Bang Theory they
[1:44:11] say almighty God
[1:44:13] they are they have brought us here amen
[1:44:16] and that God is in control
[1:44:19] praise the Lord
[1:44:21] he's in control now we were traveling
[1:44:24] with this thought uh speaking on our
[1:44:27] subject here
[1:44:29] she's more righteous than I we were
[1:44:31] dwelling on that from
[1:44:35] the the beginning of the year
[1:44:38] where we we we started to talk about
[1:44:41] Jesus speaking on uh I just want to take
[1:44:45] one place here
[1:44:46] to the to the disciples that accept our
[1:44:50] righteousness as seed the righteousness
[1:44:52] of the stripe and the Pharisees
[1:44:55] so we were looking in a scripture to
[1:44:57] realize that God play out his
[1:45:00] righteousness and we we talk on the
[1:45:03] scene of word tamai this Gentile lady
[1:45:08] she had to disguise herself
[1:45:12] and then uh because she wanted to be
[1:45:16] identified in the blessings of Abraham
[1:45:19] and uh she had to go through uh
[1:45:24] oh
[1:45:27] a kind of for four four bits or four
[1:45:30] anointing experience with the four
[1:45:32] different men and the last man turned
[1:45:34] out to be the you know the the father
[1:45:36] himself which is Judah and uh uh and
[1:45:41] yerry said that she asked Judah uh for
[1:45:46] you know for some evidence
[1:45:49] praise the Lord just like just like uh
[1:45:53] you know we said that it was it was uh
[1:45:56] uh
[1:46:01] uh a kind of a dangerous business that
[1:46:03] she she I mean she she did a very good
[1:46:06] job you know to be able to disguise
[1:46:08] herself that Judah never detected that
[1:46:12] she was the one
[1:46:13] Naomi did the same thing when she told
[1:46:15] Ruth how to get into the field of uh the
[1:46:20] Reapers to go and meet the lord of the
[1:46:23] Harvest now that that evening after
[1:46:27] harvest is done the man takes wine you
[1:46:30] know there is a place only for men to
[1:46:32] celebrate the work that they have done
[1:46:34] the hard work they celebrate the Harvest
[1:46:36] they drink wine they get drunk but yet
[1:46:39] there is a young woman she's going to go
[1:46:42] into that field which also was a
[1:46:45] dangerous thing amen praise the Lord and
[1:46:49] uh and she was going into the field to
[1:46:51] make sure there are no other man will
[1:46:54] see her
[1:46:55] no other man
[1:46:58] praise the Lord
[1:47:00] when we come here is for no other man to
[1:47:03] see you
[1:47:06] we are here to attract one person
[1:47:09] we want One Man attention that's the
[1:47:12] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:14] she got into the field for no man to see
[1:47:17] her
[1:47:22] and in those days all the men pretty
[1:47:24] much dressed the same even though the
[1:47:26] lord of the Harvest he was the bus he
[1:47:28] could dress a second word different and
[1:47:31] it was the evening she has to go by the
[1:47:33] moonlight
[1:47:38] praying and hoping that she will not
[1:47:40] fall into the wrong camp
[1:47:43] praise the Lord
[1:47:45] in so much that when boas noticed that
[1:47:49] she was at his feet it started him
[1:47:54] says who is this how did you get here
[1:48:00] this place is not a place for the girl
[1:48:01] how did you got here
[1:48:05] what she wanted
[1:48:08] she wanted the blessing
[1:48:10] she wanted to be redeemed
[1:48:13] she was told that he was a case man
[1:48:18] praise the Lord
[1:48:20] now so this morning we want to look at
[1:48:22] another character
[1:48:24] and just like how we look at the story
[1:48:27] of tema coming right in between the
[1:48:31] sword of Joseph
[1:48:33] amen
[1:48:35] praise the Lord Joseph being thrown into
[1:48:38] the well there are speaks of Joseph you
[1:48:42] know uh uh uh being persecuted by his
[1:48:44] brothers
[1:48:45] and then now Joseph will now be taking
[1:48:49] over to Egypt but right in the middle of
[1:48:51] their story there was a parenthesis
[1:48:55] praise the Lord now we're going to look
[1:48:58] at another character and then you have
[1:49:00] to realize that God placed these things
[1:49:03] in his word to grab our attention
[1:49:08] in that scripture we read was uh uh uh
[1:49:11] first Samuel chapter 24 where that David
[1:49:14] went down there he caught the the Rob of
[1:49:17] salt and he says my father see I have
[1:49:19] nothing against you and and then uh uh
[1:49:23] Saul said yes David my son you are more
[1:49:27] righteous than I
[1:49:29] praise the Lord
[1:49:31] but look at look at the beautiful things
[1:49:34] that the Bible the way the Bible going
[1:49:36] to do this is that right after the last
[1:49:40] spec of David rejection
[1:49:43] before he will become king the Holy
[1:49:47] Spirit put in another
[1:49:50] mystery of redemption
[1:49:54] praise the Lord
[1:49:57] first Samuel chapter 25
[1:49:59] brings us to a storage
[1:50:03] of a man that the Bible called a food
[1:50:05] neighbor
[1:50:09] amen
[1:50:12] now you think about it now between
[1:50:13] rejection and kinship
[1:50:19] between David last experience with Saul
[1:50:23] and just before he will get to the
[1:50:26] throne to become the king of Israel the
[1:50:29] Holy Spirit plays another Redemption
[1:50:32] story right here
[1:50:37] praise the Lord
[1:50:39] there is something about the feminine
[1:50:43] nature
[1:50:44] that God always tied Redemption tone
[1:50:49] there is something about the feminine
[1:50:51] nature it's so amazing it's so amazing
[1:50:54] when you see it in the word
[1:50:56] so amazing
[1:50:59] praise the Lord
[1:51:01] you'll realize that if you look in the
[1:51:03] scripture even as the Apostle Paul will
[1:51:05] will say is there the woman is the type
[1:51:09] of the church he will and then uh Paul
[1:51:12] will be the one just in in Roman and
[1:51:15] talks about uh uh uh uh a woman first
[1:51:20] husband have to die for her to have to
[1:51:23] take another husband and wherever brand
[1:51:25] says that is speaking about Redemption
[1:51:27] now you will also realize that um when
[1:51:31] Paul speaks in Corinthians
[1:51:33] where he talks that if uh uh a believing
[1:51:38] woman
[1:51:39] will want to stay with their own
[1:51:41] believing you will see their poor in
[1:51:44] most of those cases talk to a woman then
[1:51:47] taking the man
[1:51:51] have you realized that
[1:51:53] even the Apostle Peter in his book where
[1:51:56] he says uh that uh the the the husband
[1:52:00] will be converted by the composition of
[1:52:03] his wife
[1:52:10] praise the Lord so you will see it's a
[1:52:13] design is it it's uh intentional design
[1:52:16] by the Holy Ghost for us not to miss
[1:52:19] what God did in the beginning
[1:52:23] that's why he plays this sacred virtue
[1:52:26] in the woman because it's all tied to
[1:52:28] Redemption
[1:52:29] it's all around her life
[1:52:33] the same with the physical woman the
[1:52:35] same position with the church
[1:52:39] it's all around our life everything that
[1:52:43] is happening to us the reason why it's
[1:52:45] happening is all because of this
[1:52:47] Redemption purpose that is hanging over
[1:52:49] your life
[1:52:53] the places that God has taken you is all
[1:52:56] because of this Redemption the
[1:52:57] opportunities he's giving you is all
[1:53:00] because of his Plan of Redemption
[1:53:10] our life is designed for this purpose
[1:53:14] our life is designed for this purpose
[1:53:18] that is the force that is the thought
[1:53:20] that is driving behind our lives
[1:53:23] God's purpose of redemption
[1:53:31] right in daily life here between his
[1:53:34] last state of rejection and and and his
[1:53:37] kinship
[1:53:39] God going to pull a mystery of
[1:53:42] redemption right in his life
[1:53:45] praise the Lord and not a parenthesis
[1:53:48] the Bible speaks of uh of of this man uh
[1:53:53] uh uh being a wealthy man and David out
[1:53:56] there you know the story or you can read
[1:53:58] it when you get home that's first Samuel
[1:54:00] chapter 25.
[1:54:03] right after David has had that
[1:54:06] experience with Saul
[1:54:07] the Bible will talks about this man and
[1:54:12] uh uh uh with with all of his great
[1:54:15] possession you know that speaks of like
[1:54:18] a loudish spirit he has he was a man of
[1:54:22] great possession a man uh the man was
[1:54:26] very great and he had thousand sheeps
[1:54:28] and thousand goats and he was sharing
[1:54:31] his sheeps praise the Lord
[1:54:33] the Bible says now the name of the man
[1:54:35] was now blood and uh his wife was
[1:54:38] Abigail
[1:54:39] and she was a woman of good
[1:54:43] understanding
[1:54:45] she was a woman of good understanding
[1:54:48] meaning she has a spirit of discernment
[1:54:52] but this man was accounted for cruelly
[1:54:54] and evil in his doing and he was of the
[1:54:59] House of killing
[1:55:00] praise the Lord now so David beard
[1:55:04] spending all of his time at a time where
[1:55:06] he and his men are camping out and
[1:55:09] hiding away from Saul he's also using
[1:55:12] that time you know uh to to to also uh
[1:55:15] kind of for do watch and and protect
[1:55:18] this man property
[1:55:20] because he knows if any man comes into
[1:55:22] that camp and realize that he's there
[1:55:25] they're going to tell Saul and you will
[1:55:27] have to be on the run so they are
[1:55:29] protecting that place and at the same
[1:55:30] time they are spending time protecting
[1:55:33] you know uh being a blessing to never
[1:55:36] amen praise the Lord
[1:55:39] do you realize that that's the Bride is
[1:55:42] a blessing to laudish your age is
[1:55:45] because she is here
[1:55:47] yeah amen
[1:55:49] is because the bride is here she's the
[1:55:52] blessing to this age this age is uh uh
[1:55:56] uh is having all of his wealth is having
[1:56:00] all of his invention
[1:56:03] because the bride is here
[1:56:07] amen
[1:56:09] is the Raymond
[1:56:11] the Raymond The Leftovers of our
[1:56:14] blessing that is becoming an invention
[1:56:17] to this word
[1:56:20] the opening of the seals was the man of
[1:56:23] God the great man of God great wisdom of
[1:56:25] God
[1:56:29] they have ever
[1:56:31] hit mankind hit man knowledge
[1:56:35] and out of that explosion science is
[1:56:39] benefiting from all of this invention
[1:56:43] praise the Lord
[1:56:46] but we turn to highly esteem their
[1:56:49] invention more than the word
[1:56:51] that gave it to us
[1:56:57] it's because of us it's because of the
[1:56:59] Bride of Jesus Christ is because there
[1:57:02] is a Rapture in church here
[1:57:07] that this age
[1:57:09] is being blessed
[1:57:11] amen
[1:57:15] and it's because of God's Saving Grace
[1:57:18] in your life
[1:57:20] that's why you are enjoying good health
[1:57:24] amen that's why you are enjoying peace
[1:57:27] in your family
[1:57:34] now one comes before the other in a
[1:57:37] sense that it is now because uh uh uh
[1:57:41] you know uh science is advancing that's
[1:57:44] why the church will get to know the
[1:57:46] church already is there before science
[1:57:47] gets there
[1:57:52] now so we see here as as The Story Goes
[1:57:56] that's what I want to dwell on this
[1:57:57] morning in showing that she's more
[1:58:00] righteous than I as The Story Goes we we
[1:58:04] see that uh David sent his men he sent
[1:58:07] his young men to go down and and uh you
[1:58:11] know make some requests
[1:58:13] from Neville
[1:58:14] to go and tell him we have been out here
[1:58:17] you know we I mean we have been trying
[1:58:20] to keep thiefs and and you know intrude
[1:58:23] us from your farm you know and and we
[1:58:26] and we need this and that and then when
[1:58:28] he got there
[1:58:30] uh nebler was so drunk and then he shot
[1:58:35] the man away
[1:58:37] who's your boss who's your head David a
[1:58:39] man running away from his master and
[1:58:41] then I mean he just he just reigned
[1:58:43] curses on them
[1:58:46] praise the Lord
[1:58:49] Hallelujah
[1:58:53] the Bible says so the young man
[1:58:56] so David young men turned away and he
[1:58:58] went again and came and and told him all
[1:59:01] of these things and David said
[1:59:04] unto his men gailed you on every man he
[1:59:08] swore
[1:59:09] and and the guilt the geared themselves
[1:59:13] every man he swallowed and David
[1:59:16] himself and uh and the 400 men and and
[1:59:19] uh and 200 a bowling and stuff but
[1:59:23] one of the young men told Abigail now so
[1:59:27] David hearing this he got so so angry
[1:59:30] how can this man be Wicked how can he be
[1:59:33] rude
[1:59:34] even if you don't want to give us
[1:59:36] anything don't insult us
[1:59:40] how can he be rude so David got so angry
[1:59:45] and he was preparing his man to go and
[1:59:48] just wet the whole house of uh uh nether
[1:59:54] he was going to leave no man that would
[1:59:56] piss against the wall
[1:59:59] which means he was going to Slit all the
[2:00:01] men
[2:00:03] and now all the wealth and everything
[2:00:06] that he had that you know that make him
[2:00:08] proudful and boastful will be left
[2:00:10] behind
[2:00:13] praise the Lord but the scripture says
[2:00:15] one of the young men heard and then he
[2:00:18] ran and told Abigail and said behold
[2:00:20] David sent messenger out of the
[2:00:23] Wilderness to salute our master and he
[2:00:25] read it on them
[2:00:28] but the man were very good unto us and
[2:00:31] they and they were not hurt neither Miss
[2:00:34] we anything or as long as
[2:00:38] we were
[2:00:40] conferencing with them when we were in
[2:00:44] the field
[2:00:45] there were a war unto us both by night
[2:00:49] and by day
[2:00:51] so this young man went out and told
[2:00:53] Abigail
[2:00:55] and then uh Abigail hearing that
[2:00:58] praise the Lord
[2:01:00] Hallelujah
[2:01:02] the Bible says then Abigail May hiss and
[2:01:05] she took 200 loaves
[2:01:08] and uh two bottles of wine and and and
[2:01:12] she quickly asked them to to kill the
[2:01:16] Sheep make a sheep ready and and and and
[2:01:19] five uh measure of Posh corn I mean she
[2:01:22] she just got to working praise the Lord
[2:01:25] she just got to working
[2:01:28] she got to working
[2:01:32] praise the Lord
[2:01:33] amen because she knows she could sense
[2:01:36] Danger
[2:01:39] she could sense danger I mean you cannot
[2:01:42] live in this day and age and don't sense
[2:01:45] Danger
[2:01:48] praise the Lord
[2:01:50] the entire country has just went through
[2:01:52] one of its more embarrassing time for us
[2:01:56] getting the uh a speaker in the house
[2:02:01] praise the Lord it speaks volume
[2:02:08] it speaks volume
[2:02:10] to where we are as a nation
[2:02:16] praise the Lord
[2:02:19] and all of the things that are happening
[2:02:28] a six-year-old just pulled a gun on his
[2:02:31] teacher
[2:02:34] it speaks volume
[2:02:38] let me just get too busy
[2:02:43] and don't sense the environment we are
[2:02:46] in
[2:02:50] let us not get too busy
[2:02:54] looking for what we will not get in one
[2:02:56] day
[2:03:00] and don't be aware of the environment
[2:03:03] and the things that are happening around
[2:03:04] us
[2:03:08] praise the Lord
[2:03:10] because is that sense of danger that
[2:03:13] will influence your prayer life
[2:03:16] if you are not sensing danger you don't
[2:03:18] have anything to take to God In Prayer
[2:03:21] you don't have a need
[2:03:26] you cannot spend time before God because
[2:03:28] you you have no sensitivity to the
[2:03:31] things that are happening around you
[2:03:34] the sense of danger make you to think
[2:03:37] about your young children the sense of
[2:03:39] danger make you to think about what will
[2:03:42] my future be if these things are
[2:03:44] happening now
[2:03:51] praise the Lord
[2:03:53] and because she says danger she got to
[2:03:57] work
[2:04:01] she got busy there was there was just no
[2:04:04] time to I mean I I just just played
[2:04:07] around
[2:04:09] she knew that she had to do everything
[2:04:13] or as joshmen
[2:04:16] because you know what happened like
[2:04:18] better Branham said every time a seal
[2:04:21] is open Josh may follow
[2:04:26] praise the Lord every time a seal open
[2:04:29] Josh may follow you can see that even in
[2:04:32] the life of tema bring her here let her
[2:04:35] be burned
[2:04:36] that was judgment
[2:04:38] why because she had a seal
[2:04:47] praise the Lord
[2:04:57] so Abigail God blessed and she started
[2:04:59] putting all of these things together
[2:05:04] and she said unto her seven
[2:05:08] go on before me behold I come after you
[2:05:11] but she told me her husband
[2:05:16] okay
[2:05:21] she never wanted to get into an argument
[2:05:25] she never want to get somebody reasoning
[2:05:27] to her
[2:05:28] because she could sense the danger
[2:05:32] praise the Lord
[2:05:35] and it was so as she rolled on an ice on
[2:05:39] the eyes dead she came down by the cover
[2:05:42] of the hill and behold David and his man
[2:05:45] came down against her and she met them
[2:05:49] now David
[2:05:51] has said surely in vain have I kept all
[2:05:55] that this Fellow Heart in the wilderness
[2:05:58] so that nothing was missed of all you
[2:06:03] know see such a kindness I mean they
[2:06:07] were so kind so respectful
[2:06:16] nothing was messed of all that patina to
[2:06:19] him and he had required mean evil for
[2:06:22] guilt
[2:06:27] so and more also do God unto the enemies
[2:06:31] of David
[2:06:33] if I leave of all that pertin to him by
[2:06:37] the Morning Light any that places
[2:06:40] against the wall
[2:06:41] so David actually had judgment in his
[2:06:45] mind
[2:06:48] praise the Lord
[2:06:49] he said this man has re he has rewarded
[2:06:52] me even for good I'm going to
[2:06:56] I'm going to bring judgment upon this
[2:06:57] house
[2:07:00] praise the Lord
[2:07:08] and when Abigail saw David she hissed it
[2:07:11] she lied her off her ass and fell down
[2:07:13] on her face and bowed herself to the
[2:07:16] ground and fell and and and fell at his
[2:07:19] feet and said upon me my Lord upon me
[2:07:23] let this iniquity be
[2:07:27] praise the Lord intercession
[2:07:31] she went right into an intercession
[2:07:35] a poor mean a poor mean let this
[2:07:38] iniquity be
[2:07:40] praise the Lord
[2:07:41] Hallelujah
[2:07:43] but as the story goes on there is
[2:07:45] something yet I want for us to pick up

[2:15:40] let me close this Bible
[2:15:42] but you think about it
[2:15:45] think about the things
[2:15:49] you know you know how you know you know
[2:15:51] what the feeling is
[2:15:53] you know what the feeling is
[2:15:56] not having no idea that this the seventh
[2:15:59] thing will have happened
[2:16:01] you're not having no idea and you just
[2:16:04] took a wrong approach
[2:16:07] you know how disappointing it can be
[2:16:12] how hard dropping it can be
[2:16:14] if I only knew
[2:16:24] praise the Lord
[2:16:27] amen
[2:16:32] the righteousness of God
[2:16:34] being revealed
[2:16:38] God holding
[2:16:41] David back
[2:16:44] from doing the work I mean I mean we've
[2:16:48] we've we've we've never added to you you
[2:16:50] can just see how the Bible say he was a
[2:16:53] selfish man he was a cruel man a man who
[2:16:57] just only trusted in his wealth
[2:17:00] have no regard for nobody
[2:17:04] I think his cup was full
[2:17:09] his cup was falling God was going to
[2:17:12] deal with him because of the Cruel Heart
[2:17:14] that he had
[2:17:22] praise the Lord
[2:17:28] and how Abigail just just stepped right
[2:17:31] in there
[2:17:32] a woman of discernment
[2:17:36] amen a woman of wisdom wise heart she
[2:17:40] just stepped right in there
[2:17:42] to hold the wrath of God
[2:17:49] that's the place of the Bride
[2:17:52] our King is coming soon
[2:17:55] amen the King of Kings and the Lord of
[2:17:58] Lord we know there is a show house for
[2:18:00] him
[2:18:01] we know there is a show house we know
[2:18:05] that there will be a millennium a 1 000
[2:18:08] year reign on this Earth we know there
[2:18:11] is a show House
[2:18:13] we are standing just like uh uh uh
[2:18:16] Abigail praise the Lord see what she
[2:18:19] said there
[2:18:21] see how she interceded
[2:18:24] and David you're seeing how the mercy of
[2:18:27] God through this woman held him back
[2:18:30] from from sharing blood
[2:18:33] when he got on the throne that was the
[2:18:34] first thing he had he wanted uh uh
[2:18:37] Abigail after never die
[2:18:41] amen
[2:18:45] that this is the woman
[2:18:47] the helmet back
[2:18:49] from something that I would not have
[2:18:51] forgiven myself
[2:18:56] praise the Lord
[2:19:00] God is the place of the Bride
[2:19:02] that's where the Throne of Mercy is
[2:19:08] but what is happening we are allowing
[2:19:10] this last day Spirit to pressure us in
[2:19:15] amen
[2:19:17] to pressure us in
[2:19:20] and soak all of that virtue out of our
[2:19:22] life that we so snap at everything
[2:19:26] we just snap at every giving instance
[2:19:32] and sometimes we miss Josh things
[2:19:38] Miss George thinks of our children Miss
[2:19:40] judging of our spouses Miss George
[2:19:42] things of our parents
[2:19:44] and we just snapped
[2:19:47] I said well what are you talking like oh
[2:19:49] I never knew that was why you wanted to
[2:19:51] do
[2:19:56] praise the Lord
[2:19:58] and sometimes we just take it if we just
[2:20:00] take it as the norm of the day
[2:20:13] look church if we if if we're not
[2:20:15] finding time to spend with our
[2:20:18] bridegroom
[2:20:19] and I was I was there in the office this
[2:20:21] morning and uh the Sunday School tip was
[2:20:24] playing I hear I had a a marriage
[2:20:27] ceremony and I said well I did not know
[2:20:29] wedding was taking place today
[2:20:31] I didn't know that wedding was taking
[2:20:33] place here come the bride I said oh my
[2:20:35] God
[2:20:36] amen well you see how brother Branham
[2:20:38] closed that wedding ceremony
[2:20:42] he brought the whole ceremony to this
[2:20:44] place just as this bride
[2:20:47] and her husband so Lord we are
[2:20:51] we in our bridegroom
[2:20:54] that's the bigger picture
[2:20:59] whatever that is happening in our life
[2:21:01] is so small a picture
[2:21:07] then the picture from God's mind
[2:21:19] let us not allow work and and and
[2:21:22] everything that is happening around our
[2:21:25] life
[2:21:26] to be able to to I mean to squeeze that
[2:21:29] grace of God out of us so squeeze the
[2:21:32] sweetness of God out of her we get Soul
[2:21:34] pressure because we work work work and
[2:21:37] our mind is just going to catch up with
[2:21:39] the next time and the next thing to do
[2:21:41] and the next thing on the agenda and the
[2:21:43] next thing and and and it just burned us
[2:21:45] out of strength
[2:21:47] that we have no time to be able to
[2:21:49] reflect
[2:21:51] and take the right action when we are
[2:21:54] supposed to
[2:22:02] be able to get in the chamber and spend
[2:22:05] some time with the Lord
[2:22:11] we must not wait for an emergency to
[2:22:13] make us desperate
[2:22:16] there is a lot of emergency around our
[2:22:19] lives
[2:22:20] it don't have to be personal emergency
[2:22:22] there are emergency with our loved ones
[2:22:24] with our relatives
[2:22:40] and just like how these Saints are
[2:22:43] unfolding in the scripture that is the
[2:22:45] same way God
[2:22:47] does with the opening of the seals
[2:22:51] whenever the message is coming foreign
[2:22:53] there is Judgment that is also coming
[2:22:56] the the the recipients of that message
[2:22:59] receive God's grace the ones that
[2:23:01] rejected received the judgment
[2:23:07] praise the Lord
[2:23:09] Abigail here received the message she
[2:23:12] she she answered rightly to the message
[2:23:15] she received God's mercy
[2:23:17] and got right into the throne
[2:23:22] never been arrogant and you know he's
[2:23:24] always have a way to talk to anybody the
[2:23:26] way he want to talk to them
[2:23:33] because he have a right to express
[2:23:34] himself
[2:23:38] for the time we are living in
[2:23:41] musicians you can come forth what a time
[2:23:44] that we are living in and the things
[2:23:46] that is happening
[2:23:47] around us
[2:23:52] God in his great mind
[2:23:56] he has designed situations
[2:24:01] to be able to help us to see the
[2:24:04] weaknesses
[2:24:05] to help us to see the things that we
[2:24:07] need to bring to his throne
[2:24:09] he has designed situations
[2:24:13] amen
[2:24:15] just to give us the opportunity to see
[2:24:17] that area in our life where we need to
[2:24:20] keep under the blood
[2:24:39] that's the day that's the hour that we
[2:24:41] are living in
[2:24:43] foreign
[2:24:48] time that we are living in
[2:24:51] [Music]
[2:24:54] God's righteousness being expressed
[2:24:59] through you and myself God's mercy being
[2:25:02] expressed through you and myself
[2:25:06] the way we deal with things the way we
[2:25:08] deal with people
[2:25:09] [Music]
[2:25:15] but you see if we are not consecrating
[2:25:17] ourselves
[2:25:18] [Music]
[2:25:20] if we are not consecrating enough said
[2:25:22] we are not finding that time to slip
[2:25:24] away
[2:25:26] [Music]
[2:25:32] it will just be all concerned
[2:25:36] of uh
[2:25:38] how
[2:25:40] we can be entertained or how we can be
[2:25:43] fed
[2:25:45] but just like we spoke about the
[2:25:48] drafting of the birth or the formation
[2:25:50] of the birds that it used to fly
[2:25:53] you have to realize that each and every
[2:25:56] one of us
[2:25:58] we have a unique gift that we bring to
[2:26:01] the body
[2:26:04] and when you are met when you are not
[2:26:09] exercising your gift
[2:26:10] [Music]
[2:26:12] what it is your time away praying or
[2:26:15] whether it is your your I mean your
[2:26:17] present in church the way you clap your
[2:26:19] hands the way you sing the way you say
[2:26:21] Amen to the word
[2:26:24] if you are not exercising your gift
[2:26:27] you are depriving the body
[2:26:30] foreign
[2:26:32] [Music]
[2:26:38] to get out of here
[2:26:41] we need our fly information to get out
[2:26:44] of here
[2:26:44] [Music]
[2:26:49] just like the migration of the birds is
[2:26:52] a mystery it's a complete mystery to the
[2:26:55] science word
[2:26:58] there are a lot of people that try to
[2:27:00] write on it and you know they try to
[2:27:02] express what they think about it but you
[2:27:05] can still see this there's a lot there's
[2:27:07] there's a lot of gaps in the airplane
[2:27:11] it's a complete mystery to the science
[2:27:14] word and that is the same way the
[2:27:16] migration the moving of the Church of
[2:27:19] the Living God is a mystery
[2:27:21] foreign
[2:27:30] this situation
[2:27:32] situations to just come in a certain
[2:27:34] moment and setting time in our lives and
[2:27:37] and uh
[2:27:40] wanting to see his righteousness Express
[2:27:42] how are we going to deal with it
[2:27:46] like I've always said when you allow a
[2:27:49] situation to get the best of you you can
[2:27:52] never do anything good about it
[2:27:54] because I have already robbed you
[2:27:57] they have already rubbed you you can
[2:28:00] never do nothing good if a situation get
[2:28:03] the best of you
[2:28:04] you have to be the best
[2:28:07] the best of yourself to be able to deal
[2:28:10] with whatever situation
[2:28:18] yes leave it there
[2:28:23] leave it there
[2:28:27] oh take your bird into the Lord
[2:28:32] and leave it there
[2:28:37] if you trust and never doubt he will
[2:28:43] only bring you out
[2:28:46] figures
[2:28:52] blessing God for us again oh yes leave
[2:28:57] it back
[2:29:05] take your breathing to the Lord and
[2:29:10] leave it there
[2:29:14] if you trust and never doubt he will
[2:29:20] surely break you out they those burdens
[2:29:26] to the Lord and Lead yes
[2:29:32] [Music]
[2:29:37] leave it there
[2:29:41] take your burden to the Lord
[2:29:50] if you trust and never doubt he will
[2:29:56] surely break you out
[2:29:59] they just burdens to the Lord and leave
[2:30:05] it there
[2:30:08] just before we pray now you see when you
[2:30:11] when when you talk about these things
[2:30:14] and you talk about
[2:30:17] The Venture you talk about the the
[2:30:20] scripture position of the woman in the
[2:30:23] in in the in the Bible that you see the
[2:30:25] things you see the different design you
[2:30:28] know uh and the different places that
[2:30:32] God placed these female character
[2:30:35] that's that Express out his uh his
[2:30:38] Redemption plan
[2:30:42] sometimes you know you you have some
[2:30:45] some you know some some men that
[2:30:48] struggle over that thought
[2:30:50] you know it's all because Society has
[2:30:53] given us a very wrong
[2:30:57] understanding or interpretation of what
[2:30:59] manhood is and what woman who is and
[2:31:02] that's why we have all of these struggle
[2:31:04] have all of this struggle whatever man
[2:31:07] can do woman can do it and you know and
[2:31:09] we have the perversion in all the mix-up
[2:31:11] that we have going on
[2:31:12] but when you look into the Bible and you
[2:31:15] start to appreciate this you you start
[2:31:17] to look right right down from Genesis
[2:31:20] and look through the scripture and all
[2:31:22] the provision that God's made for the
[2:31:24] protection of a woman you being the
[2:31:27] Bride of Jesus Christ if you get that
[2:31:30] understanding if you get that
[2:31:32] understanding to be able to appreciate
[2:31:34] that the places that God put the woman
[2:31:37] in the scripture you know exactly that
[2:31:40] it speaks of your spiritual position
[2:31:43] because there is there is one man in
[2:31:45] this house that the Lord Jesus
[2:31:48] amen there is one man it's the Lord
[2:31:51] Jesus
[2:31:52] as his church we are his bride
[2:31:56] amen
[2:32:00] we are his bride
[2:32:05] and do you see what the kind of a
[2:32:07] struggling thing sometimes it will be
[2:32:10] because even as the Bride of Jesus
[2:32:12] Christ there's a whole lot we can learn
[2:32:13] from our mother from our sisters from
[2:32:16] our wives
[2:32:19] if they have garlic character
[2:32:21] [Music]
[2:32:25] because because in their life
[2:32:29] it's a mystery that is placed
[2:32:31] [Music]
[2:32:33] praise the Lord and you see it and and
[2:32:36] also on this on the other side you know
[2:32:39] you you have all of these striving and
[2:32:42] uh and uh you know uh uh uh uh you know
[2:32:45] like someone said it looks like in the
[2:32:48] Bible they were just on a male character
[2:32:50] it talks about David it talks about
[2:32:52] something it talks about Daniel and it
[2:32:55] just looked that it's just male
[2:32:56] character it's because you are reading
[2:32:58] it with the eyes of the society
[2:33:04] you are reading it there is something in
[2:33:06] a society that is getting at you so when
[2:33:09] you read God's word you see the same
[2:33:11] thing so you don't get the benefit
[2:33:16] you don't get the benefit
[2:33:18] [Music]
[2:33:20] but there is a blessing
[2:33:23] there is a blessing in the way that God
[2:33:26] designed us
[2:33:31] they will say where can I go and hide
[2:33:33] myself from the Lord
[2:33:34] foreign
[2:33:37] where can I go
[2:33:38] even in the depths of the seed he is
[2:33:41] there
[2:33:43] [Music]
[2:33:48] let's buy our house to the Lord there
[2:33:51] [Music]
[2:34:08] Heavenly Father
[2:34:12] Lord we just took a little bit of nature
[2:34:15] today
[2:34:16] looking at the birds looking at that
[2:34:19] Heavenly creature Lord
[2:34:23] father one of these days to God we're
[2:34:26] going to set our wings right
[2:34:28] and we will fly away
[2:34:31] one of these days so Lord God we're
[2:34:34] going to be quicking
[2:34:36] one of these days we're going to be
[2:34:37] lifted above our trials
[2:34:41] going to be lifted above Lord fly away
[2:34:43] from the things that we are dealing with
[2:34:45] now actually death Lord but an
[2:34:48] overcoming power
[2:34:49] something that is in your word that will
[2:34:51] lift us above those things Lord
[2:34:55] and father just looking at the design of
[2:34:58] the bird
[2:34:59] [Music]
[2:35:01] it was just to be able to grab a mental
[2:35:05] picture Lord
[2:35:09] of you the designer
[2:35:12] the ability that you put in all of those
[2:35:14] creatures
[2:35:15] [Music]
[2:35:20] there is none of us here can look at a
[2:35:22] bare tree and knock it with our hands
[2:35:24] without getting the bruise but the
[2:35:27] Woodpecker can go at that tree
[2:35:30] and nail into the tree
[2:35:33] we don't have that ability
[2:35:35] but that little bird have it
[2:35:39] and father that is the same way everyone
[2:35:43] sitting on the sound of my voice this
[2:35:45] morning however God giving ability
[2:35:48] a god-giving design
[2:35:51] something that God has put his own
[2:35:54] inscription on in our life
[2:35:58] that the work of God can be manifested
[2:36:04] that we can be a blessing to our family
[2:36:06] we can be a blessing to our wives we can
[2:36:09] be a blessing to our children we can be
[2:36:12] a blessing to our husband we can be a
[2:36:15] blessing to our loved ones and the
[2:36:17] neighbors and our co-workers
