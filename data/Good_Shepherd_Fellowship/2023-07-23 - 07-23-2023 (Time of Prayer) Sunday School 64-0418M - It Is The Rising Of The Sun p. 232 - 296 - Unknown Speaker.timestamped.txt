[5:49] again at the Finish
[5:51] see when God looked down upon the body
[5:54] the spirit left into the garden against
[5:55] him and he had to die a man remember
[5:57] friends he didn't have to do that
[6:00] that was God
[6:03] God anointed that flesh which is human
[6:05] flesh and he didn't and he didn't want
[6:07] to first God he'd never die that kind of
[6:09] death take your God but he didn't have
[6:13] to do it but remember he went there
[6:16] which you in him
[6:20] crap
[6:21] God had never separated the bride
[6:24] from the groom yet
[6:27] so when God looked down upon the body of
[6:29] Christ he saw for male and female
[6:33] it was all redeemed that one body
[6:36] see
[6:38] they are one
[6:40] same same word
[6:41] the same word spoke of the group speak
[6:43] to the right
[6:45] well how can the Bride come and fail to
[6:47] manifest everything was promised of him
[6:49] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[6:51] the bride but when he did everything
[6:53] even to prove it by raising himself up
[6:55] from the dead afterwards
[6:58] then don't the group The Bride have to
[7:00] do the same thing has to be exactly what
[7:01] the word said she's being these last
[7:03] things
[7:04] so she had to return to the Malachi poor
[7:06] don't you have to be manifested like was
[7:08] the days of Sodom not the world has to
[7:10] be just exactly like it is n't these
[7:12] things a perfect identification of The
[7:14] World God made no one to
[7:17] the Francis I know I'm keeping a long
[7:19] time 15 minutes after dinner but maybe
[7:21] I'll get two but then but notice looking
[7:23] here what a perfect thing it is I don't
[7:26] know what to see it again
[7:27] look notice this but God foresaw the
[7:31] bride
[7:33] in the groom
[7:35] Hallelujah
[7:37] see to save his wife like Adam
[7:40] he had to go with her
[7:42] I didn't know what he was doing he
[7:45] didn't know what she was doing
[7:46] but Adam walked out with his wife
[7:49] see and Jesus took his wife's place
[7:53] and they can't stand for her remember he
[7:56] became you Mr Joy punishment that you
[8:00] might stand in his place he stood in
[8:03] your place that you might stand in his
[8:06] place
[8:07] what a love
[8:08] what a fellowship how can we deny how
[8:11] can we do anything but loving friends uh
[8:13] she could stay on her hours but let's
[8:15] move on real quick
[8:16] right
[8:18] uh the Pentecostal experience today and
[8:21] the coming of the Holy Ghost in This
[8:23] last days This Promise is like the
[8:25] abstract to a tidal deed
[8:28] see now you can get a title
[8:31] sure
[8:32] you can get a title to a place but that
[8:35] still don't say it's yours
[8:37] no sir somebody way back here come here
[8:39] and put a claim on it
[8:41] but when you get an abstract
[8:45] that shows us everything it ever again
[8:47] to the struggle
[8:49] come back from the foundation is that
[8:51] right and when a man has said that he
[8:55] believes the word
[8:56] and then when the Holy Spirit comes it
[8:59] is the abstract to the title
[9:02] and that gives you permission when you
[9:04] have that abstract and every bit of that
[9:07] boss you and everything's all it belongs
[9:09] to you
[9:11] right
[9:16] when the Holy Ghost comes upon this
[9:18] title
[9:21] for the foundation of the world and put
[9:24] a name on The Book of Life that was born
[9:26] to a man and woman and subject to sin
[9:28] and guilty of sin
[9:30] but when I believed on it I received the
[9:33] deed but when the Holy Ghost comes it
[9:35] was the abstract
[9:37] that everything that gets me whether my
[9:40] mother done it my father done it my
[9:42] grandmother done it like a little
[9:43] epileptic child and prayed for if you
[9:45] didn't know that comes to you from the
[9:46] grandparents therefore if she fell down
[9:49] and upon the child I said but when the
[9:51] abstract has come
[9:54] it struck off omitted everything
[9:57] I'm a abstract
[10:02] amen
[10:04] well and it sure is a spirit
[10:07] quite dead I haven't
[10:09] that I'm part of that body with the
[10:12] abstract of the Holy Ghost making that
[10:14] body of word lit up just exactly like it
[10:17] did
[10:18] [Music]
[10:20] the abstract call my sins are struck out
[10:23] all your sins are stuck
[10:26] by the blood of Jesus Christ and the
[10:28] Holy Ghost has come as an abstract
[10:31] to the title deed that God Gave Me by
[10:34] Grace by poor knowledge
[10:36] oh my God what's good about no wonder
[10:40] sets me around amen I'm either was dead
[10:42] and alive again and I'm alive River
[10:44] board at the keys of death and hell

[10:53] the abstract type the debt is settled
[10:56] everything against it has been struggle
[10:59] uh
[11:00] Glory
[11:01] may I silly but I feel good
[11:04] oh an abstract D do you realize what

[15:27] in the Heavenly places in Christ
[15:29] oh it was the old Phillips at quickening
[15:32] party boy let's take another man there
[15:35] was a man by the name of Enoch
[15:38] a head walk with every word of God for
[15:40] about 500 years
[15:50] hit him on that mechanic he didn't even
[15:52] have to die just don't know
[15:54] it started walking he said Mike Phillips
[15:56] he got to pull a quick entire instead of
[15:58] going over to the gates and going to
[15:59] another place where they found him up in
[16:01] the upper Coast is there instead of that
[16:02] way he was like well I said I'm an old
[16:04] man anyhow I just got too much quickly
[16:05] bars walk around here that sustained
[16:08] quickly car that we have right now
[16:11] see it will Quicken your mortal body is
[16:14] that right it's the quickly power Enoch
[16:17] was that perfect testimony that
[16:19] everything God told me to do I did it
[16:20] everything that I've seen he said for me
[16:23] to do I've done it and he become so full
[16:25] of Dynamics or or mechanics until when
[16:28] the quickening power stuck in the
[16:30] mechanic he just missing him right up he
[16:32] walked on out of the earth into heaven
[16:34] now
[16:35] now don't oh no idea
[16:38] I actually look Elijah that great
[16:41] prophet man is here's the excuse me
[16:44] brother sister in that day
[16:46] he had busted them painted face women
[16:50] then Jazzy Bell
[16:51] and they had and stood until and nobody
[16:55] looked like she stood with him and he
[16:57] rebuked and desired and stood out there
[17:00] and God is taking care of him and helped
[17:02] him in every place you know the old
[17:03] fella got tired one day
[17:05] you gotta get old
[17:07] so I just can't go far as it was going
[17:09] on I guess it's 90 years old three year
[17:12] old walking around there and he was so
[17:13] full of great and power you know what he
[17:15] looked across the yard
[17:17] oh God
[17:19] I can almost see the other side against
[17:21] you
[17:22] so full of equity power until he beat
[17:25] his chair it hooked over there
[17:27] some horses to fire charifier hooked to
[17:30] some tree over there he just walked
[17:32] across the river and went home
[17:34] without even gone the quickly power set
[17:37] called The Chariot to come down from
[17:39] heaven
[17:40] and take him up he pushed all these
[17:42] coats and thought it back for Elijah
[17:44] that's right now
[17:47] then that thought picked up that roll
[17:48] the time for the church
[17:50] picked up that road
[17:53] now he done twice a miracle which is the
[17:57] type of Christ in the church
[17:59] Elijah done four he done eight
[18:02] he would double the power of course he
[18:04] asked for greater things than this that
[18:06] I do shall you do see but he was so full
[18:09] of quickly power
[18:11] and everything until he done all these
[18:13] double what Elisha does more than he did
[18:15] he did and notice he lived the life on
[18:17] up to about 80 or 90 years old he got
[18:20] old
[18:21] and he died

[18:39] and they were packing a dead man one day
[18:41] and assault the enemy and they just told
