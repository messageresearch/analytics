[22:45] Good to be in [music] the house of the

[22:53] brother [music] Lawrence led the song in
[22:55] the way he did because I wanted for us
[22:58] to just uh have a little prayer meeting
[23:01] tonight uh the first portion of the
[23:04] service but then uh I couldn't come out
[23:07] [music] early. So let's just take some
[23:10] few prayer needs here. A praise report.
[23:13] Uh that's from sister [music] Naomi. My
[23:15] brother George has claimed his healing
[23:18] and now his body is obeying. Amen. God
[23:21] is so [music] good. Praise the Lord. We
[23:24] thank the Lord for that.
[23:27] Amen. We thank the Lord for that. We
[23:30] pray that God will just uh continue to
[23:32] strengthen him. He will [music] go from
[23:35] uh from health to health and grace to
[23:36] grace. Amen. Praise the Lord. And uh uh
[23:41] we will uh take prayer needs a beautiful
[23:44] call this evening. She's not well. I
[23:47] think she's down with a cold and cough.
[23:49] So [music] she asked that we remember

[23:55] let us know that brother Ben traveled
[23:57] last week [music]
[23:58] uh to Kenya. So uh he should be back uh
[24:02] [music] after two weeks. So we want to

[24:23] together tonight because he live I can

[24:50] gratefulness to the Lord tonight. Bring

[25:03] the year. He's been faithful. He's been
[25:06] good. His mercy has been reached unto
[25:08] us. [music]

[41:43] Second Sunday, chapter 23. We started
[41:46] this little talk on on Davis Mand on
[41:49] Sunday. And then uh I was thinking uh uh
[41:54] I had this thought as I was uh
[41:58] meditating on the service. I was just
[42:01] thinking about the way that God look at
[42:03] might. The way that God look at might.
[42:07] As humans, we look at might with the
[42:09] measures of muzzles and heights.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; But God look at might a complete
[42:14] different way. Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; He told Gideon that he was a mighty man
[42:19] of Gideon couldn't see no might in
[42:22] himself.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; And then he had to test God and test God
[42:28] and test God. God look at might in a
[42:31] complete different way
[42:34] &gt;&gt; in a complete different way. I was
[42:36] thinking about it and says uh what God
[42:40] the way he look at things is just
[42:42] completely different.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; You know he told he told Samuel man look
[42:46] at the outward I look at the heart.
[42:48] Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; I look at the heart I look at I look at
[42:52] you know deeper than the heart. Let's
[42:54] read tonight so I wouldn't keep you
[42:56] standing and let's see how the Holy
[42:58] Spirit will minister to us tonight.
[43:00] Praise the Lord.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's read uh verseh 15.
[43:06] Verse 15.
[43:08] Praise the Lord.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; How would you get it?
[43:33] Let's read from verse 13 a little bit.
[43:36] And three of the 30 chief went down. And
[43:40] David came in the harvest time onto the
[43:44] cave of uh Adelon. And the troop of the
[43:49] Philistine page in the valley of Rafim.
[43:53] And David was then inhold.
[43:58] And the garrison of the Philistine
[44:01] was then in Bethlehem.
[44:04] And David and said, "Oh, that I
[44:09] oh that one will give me drink of the
[44:13] water of the well of Bethlehem,
[44:16] which is by the gate."
[44:21] And the three mighty men break through
[44:24] the horse of the Philistine and drew
[44:27] water out of the word of Bethlehem
[44:30] that was by the gate and took it and
[44:33] brought it to David. Nevertheless,
[44:38] he will not drink thereof. I thought he
[44:42] said he wanted to drink.
[44:45] And after those men risk their life,
[44:50] he will not drink the water.
[44:54] Praise the Lord.
[44:57] Why he did that?
[45:00] Why David did that? Well, I get to
[45:04] heaven. I will ask him. But let's let's
[45:06] let's just finish the scripture yet.
[45:09] Amen.
[45:10] and that the three mighty men break
[45:12] through the host of the Philistine and
[45:14] drew water out of the word of Bethlehem
[45:16] that was by the gate, the exact place he
[45:19] spoke about, and took it and brought it
[45:22] to David. Nevertheless, he would not
[45:24] drink thereof, but pour it out unto the
[45:28] Lord.
[45:31] And uh he said, "Be a far from me, oh
[45:34] Lord, that I should do this.
[45:38] Is not this the blood of the man? What
[45:42] is the blood? The water.
[45:46] Praise the Lord. What is the blood? The
[45:50] water.
[45:52] Is not this the blood of the man. The
[45:54] very water that he desired to drink, he
[45:57] called it the blood of the man.
[46:00] Is not this
[46:02] the blood of the man that went in japot
[46:05] of their life? Therefore, he would not
[46:08] drink these things did the three mighty
[46:12] men. Let's pray. Father, in the name of
[46:15] the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask tonight,
[46:18] oh God, that you would come and uh just
[46:21] bless this little thought to our hearts.
[46:23] Father, God uh we dwelling on the
[46:26] inspiration from your prophet that David
[46:29] desire was a command to this man.
[46:34] Oh God, I pray tonight, Father, Lord,
[46:37] that your desire
[46:40] will be our command.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; But Lord, it have to be a revelation,
[46:44] Lord.
[46:46] Father, because David never told this
[46:48] man, you go get me water.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; You only said, "I wish I could get water
[46:53] from that well." So, Father, we pray
[46:56] tonight that we find your internal
[46:59] thoughts as we fellowship with God. And
[47:02] Lord, the Holy Ghost can can can
[47:04] minister to your people in depths, Lord.
[47:06] Your Holy Ghost can speak to your
[47:09] people, Father, Lord, far away from what
[47:11] the preacher is saying and just bring
[47:13] the word home to our individual life. I
[47:16] pray let it be tonight. Father, in Jesus
[47:19] name we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord bless
[47:24] you. You can have your seat. Thinking
[47:26] about this, I also thought about our
[47:28] Lord Jesus. Here is David.
[47:32] uh uh uh wanting water, you know, he's
[47:39] just expressing it. When you read the
[47:41] scripture yet, the Bible says the
[47:42] Philistines
[47:44] uh uh David was in a garrison of the
[47:47] Philistine was then in Bethlehem. So
[47:50] Bethlehem was completely captured by the
[47:54] Philistines. It was completely captured.
[47:57] It was it was it was uh uh uh uh yeah it
[48:01] was under the control of the the
[48:04] Philistines.
[48:06] And uh uh I will also think in my mind
[48:11] that David never thought that this man
[48:15] was going to do that. He never thought
[48:17] about it. And I will also believe in my
[48:20] mind that those men never told David
[48:23] that we are going to bring you water.
[48:26] Just wait for us. We coming back. Praise
[48:28] the Lord.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Because if if David year is pouring this
[48:32] water out, he will have told those men,
[48:35] don't risk your life.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; I'm just only thinking about it. I'm
[48:38] just I'm just I'm there's just something
[48:40] I'm saying. I really don't I can drink
[48:42] the water we have here.
[48:44] Praise the Lord.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, as I was thinking
[48:48] about this, as I was thinking about
[48:51] this,
[48:53] uh, I thought what actually was on my
[48:57] mind was, uh, I even had to how to go
[49:00] and play brother Brandon tape on the
[49:02] thirst.
[49:04] I was thinking about our Lord Jesus
[49:11] there on the cross
[49:14] expressing that he was thirsty.
[49:19] Here's the creator of heaven and earth,
[49:21] the one that make water saying I'm
[49:24] thirsty.
[49:26] The Bible says he said there that the
[49:28] scripture will be fulfilled. And we know
[49:31] that uh David said they gave him vinegar
[49:34] and uh but I believe there there is
[49:36] there is more to them. There is more to
[49:39] death. So as we look at this a little
[49:42] bit tonight, I want us to look at uh uh
[49:47] look at the the inspiration thirst and
[49:50] uh uh in the sense that the uh his
[49:55] desire being our command. Think about
[49:58] that. That is that is a very very very
[50:02] strong thought.
[50:03] His desire was a command to those men
[50:08] and thirst is a desire.
[50:12] Praise the Lord.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Thirst is a desire. Now what is God
[50:18] desire for us? What is his desire for us
[50:21] for this age?
[50:24] Praise the Lord.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is his desire of bringing us
[50:28] together under the message of the hour?
[50:30] Is it to start another denomination or
[50:34] uh you know uh uh uh or just to live for
[50:37] uh William Brandon? I don't believe
[50:39] that's God's desire.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that that uh that that
[50:48] is his desire.
[50:50] Let's let's look at a scripture over in
[50:52] St. John chapter 7.
[50:59] Praise the Lord
[51:03] as we just develop this together
[51:07] because I was thinking on all of this
[51:08] and uh uh I couldn't get my notes
[51:13] properly together.
[51:19] Hallelujah.
[51:21] Now verse 37. This is this is a familiar
[51:24] scripture. St. John chapter 7 verse 37.
[51:29] At the last day, the great day of the
[51:33] feast, Jesus stood and cried,
[51:36] &gt;&gt; saying, "If any man thirst,
[51:39] &gt;&gt; let him come unto me and drink."
[51:44] Praise the Lord.
[51:46] Amen.
[51:49] He that believeth on me, as the
[51:53] scripture
[51:55] have said, out of his belly shall flow
[52:00] rivers of living water. Now listen to
[52:02] this. Now the Bible says, "But this
[52:05] speak he
[52:06] of the spirit which they that believe on
[52:10] him should receive. For the Holy Ghost
[52:16] was not yet given. The Holy Ghost was
[52:19] not yet given. But Jesus is saying is in
[52:22] you. It will flow.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; He just needed to turn the tap.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; But he's already telling them, it's in
[52:34] you.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; God.
[52:37] out of your belly will flow rivers of
[52:41] water. So if his thirst,
[52:45] if he had a thirst, it was not for a
[52:48] Roman glass of water. He was thirsting.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; When Jesus on the cross said, "I
[52:54] thirst."
[52:56] He was thirsting from the water that
[52:58] would come out of your belly.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; God.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he have already said it
[53:06] here.
[53:08] If you believe in me according to the
[53:10] scripture, out of your belly will flow
[53:13] rivers of water.
[53:15] That's what he said.
[53:17] Praise the Lord.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And this he speak of the spirit
[53:23] which they that believe on him should
[53:25] receive.
[53:28] So right THERE ON THE CROSS AS HE WAS
[53:31] ABOUT TO GIVE UP THE GHOST, he was also
[53:36] DESIRING THAT THAT SPIRIT THAT DWELLETH
[53:38] IN HIM, the spirit that performed the
[53:41] miracle that healed the sick, HE WAS
[53:43] DESIRING TO SEE that in his disciples.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; He was desiring to see that in the
[53:53] believers.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:55] So when HE SAID I THIRST, I'M LONGING. I
[53:58] HAVE A DESIRE.
[54:01] I have a desire.
[54:07] Praise the Lord. He was expressing a
[54:11] desire
[54:12] of seeing
[54:15] rivers of water flowing out of our
[54:19] belly. Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Out of our belly. That's that's uh
[54:24] that's the tank of our life.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Rivers of water flowing out of our
[54:30] belly. Speaking of the Holy Ghost.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are you seeing are you
[54:42] seeing the thought of of what I'm going
[54:44] through tonight? Amen. If if uh if David
[54:48] will express that, he's just saying it
[54:51] knowing that the the the whole city is
[54:53] taken over by the the the the the
[54:57] Philistines and he's just walking back
[55:00] and forth. I like the way that brother
[55:01] Brandon said it. I'm going to share that
[55:03] with you tonight. Uh uh
[55:07] he said David was just pissing, you
[55:10] know, going back and forth.
[55:12] Praise the Lord.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was just he was just pissing
[55:16] going back and forth.
[55:22] Praise the Lord. He was just going back
[55:24] and forth and and just and just talking
[55:27] to himself, you know, he was not he was
[55:29] not actually talking to those guys and
[55:31] says, "Oh man,
[55:34] man." Yeah. Hand is taken by these
[55:37] Philistines, these uh uncircumcised men.
[55:41] Oh my. How I just wish remember that
[55:43] that well down there just talking by
[55:45] himself you know and he said there now
[55:49] the Bible says when they brought him the
[55:51] water he says uh this is the blood of
[55:53] this man. So what I want what I saw in
[55:56] this is that um it was beautiful that uh
[56:01] the the how the word the water and the
[56:07] blood.
[56:10] Praise the Lord.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; The word that David spoke,
[56:15] oh that I would get water from
[56:20] the well of Bethlehem.
[56:22] And the man went and brought the water.
[56:26] And David said, "No, I'm not going to
[56:28] drink it because this is their blood."
[56:31] Because they put their life on the line.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that was that was just that
[56:40] was just beautiful. Just beautiful just
[56:42] thinking about it.
[56:45] But let's uh let's let's just uh uh uh
[56:50] read some few things brother Brandon
[56:51] said here from the message just as we as
[56:55] we look at this together. Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:09] Abraham said this. He said
[57:14] he says uh I was looking and thinking
[57:17] about the word test. So I look up in the
[57:21] dictionary to see what it means. And
[57:24] here this uh uh and here is what Webster
[57:28] says is a painful desire.
[57:32] a painful
[57:35] when you want something so bad
[57:39] until it becomes painful to you.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; When you want something so bad until it
[57:51] becomes [crying] painful, you know,
[57:53] James says when we ask, we ask in the
[57:57] midst.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; We just ask.
[58:01] Praise the Lord.
[58:03] We ask in the midst is is it means that
[58:06] it does not come from a place of a
[58:09] painful desire.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Or a a gain in a sense
[58:17] that uh I mean you have you already have
[58:20] you just want another one.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; And if you don't have that other one,
[58:25] you won't mind anyway because you
[58:26] already have it.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:31] And he says many times that's the that's
[58:33] the way we act.
[58:36] Praise the Lord. But you see uh uh uh uh
[58:42] like the Bible says the Lord will will
[58:44] give the desires of our heart and the
[58:47] Bible says uh uh you know uh uh he
[58:50] search the intents of our hearts.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows
[58:58] how much level of pain when the heart
[59:01] gets in that it becomes so desperate.
[59:07] You just think about what a painful
[59:10] desire it was to Hana
[59:13] wanting a child so bad
[59:17] that right in the in the sound like she
[59:19] don't she didn't care who was listening
[59:22] to her or what they were think about
[59:24] her. I mean, it was just so so so bad.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; I believe that was now her first time
[59:31] praying on that request, but this time
[59:33] it was different.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; This time it was different.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; It was it was it was different. It was a
[59:45] a a kind of a pain that can be compared
[59:49] to a pain of a mother that is in travel.
[59:54] that brother Brandon would call birth
[59:56] pains. [snorts]
[59:58] Praise the Lord. He says it's a painful
[1:00:01] desire.
[1:00:03] When you want something so bad,
[1:00:10] but I like I said, I don't think that
[1:00:12] David wanted that water so bad or else
[1:00:14] he was going to drink it.
[1:00:17] But I believe that uh uh uh the the the
[1:00:21] Holy Spirit give us that record for our
[1:00:25] own benefit. And that's the reason why a
[1:00:27] prophet can bring it to us this way that
[1:00:30] his desire was a command today.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And our Lord had a desire before he left
[1:00:41] this earth. He expressed it,
[1:00:44] I'm thirsty.
[1:00:48] Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Can we bring him water?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Can we be able to break the garrison of
[1:00:57] the Philistines or the garrison of
[1:00:59] Laodisha with all the things that
[1:01:02] Laudisha has put around us? Are we able
[1:01:05] to break through to be able to bring
[1:01:08] water to our thirsty Lord?
[1:01:13] No matter what life throws before us,
[1:01:15] are we able to break through?
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Are we are we really seeing his need?
[1:01:28] David was David never had nails in his
[1:01:30] hands. The Bible say he was in a hole.
[1:01:33] He was he was in a cave.
[1:01:37] WELL, YEAH, HIS LIFE ALSO was in danger,
[1:01:42] but he was not in pain
[1:01:45] like our Lord. So, so, so Jesus
[1:01:48] expressing that because it's a painful
[1:01:50] desire. It was not just only the the
[1:01:53] thirst of a a dry throat, but it was the
[1:01:57] thirst that was also missed with with
[1:01:59] pains in his hands and and and pains in
[1:02:02] his legs and pains from the from the
[1:02:04] whip on his back.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] Amen.
[1:02:19] I was listening to brother Brownley in
[1:02:21] that message. He was talking about when
[1:02:23] when when a deer is is is wounded.
[1:02:27] He says all he needs is just to get to a
[1:02:30] river and just drink some water
[1:02:34] to be able to help regulate the blood in
[1:02:36] his body so he can take off and run.
[1:02:45] And that's what I was thinking about.
[1:02:49] Seeing what our our age is, seeing what
[1:02:52] our city in Minneapolis is, seeing what
[1:02:55] our what good shepherd is. Can we bring
[1:02:59] him water?
[1:03:03] Because he say out of your belly.
[1:03:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; The water that he wanted to drink was
[1:03:10] that uh uh the Roman soldier water.
[1:03:15] For the matter of fact, it never even
[1:03:17] given to him. They gave him vinegar.
[1:03:21] I believe his thirst
[1:03:24] was for that living water
[1:03:27] that would soon burst 40 days after
[1:03:31] that was going to burst and flow out of
[1:03:33] the belly of his believers, of his
[1:03:35] disciples.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; And I believe we we have that savior.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; We have we have a we have a fountain of
[1:03:45] living waters that is that is in us. You
[1:03:47] know I was talking to a good friend good
[1:03:50] friend uh uh many years back he used to
[1:03:53] be our song leader very good friend. He
[1:03:55] called me this morning maybe around 500
[1:03:58] a.m. I seen his call on my phone and
[1:04:01] wondering oh my god what's going on? So
[1:04:03] I didn't pick the phone and he called me
[1:04:05] back again. I didn't pick the phone call
[1:04:08] because I was I was I was uh praying and
[1:04:12] just preparing myself for the day.
[1:04:15] And uh so I call him later
[1:04:18] and then we talking you know I uh you
[1:04:21] know from one thing to another and he
[1:04:23] says uh uh uh how's the church? I said
[1:04:26] no church is doing good. The Lord been
[1:04:28] the Lord's been gracious to us and we
[1:04:30] doing okay. So I asked him I says I says
[1:04:34] how's the church on your hand? He said
[1:04:36] no there's no church here. I said why
[1:04:38] there's no church there? said, "No,
[1:04:40] because there's no church here." I said,
[1:04:42] "So, I mean, why are you there and there
[1:04:44] is no church there?" He says, "Well, I'm
[1:04:45] not a minister." I said, "You have to be
[1:04:47] a minister for the church to be there."
[1:04:49] "Well, I I don't have a ministry." I
[1:04:51] said, "What do you call a ministry?
[1:04:54] What What are you calling a ministry?
[1:04:56] Are you not a child of God? Are you
[1:04:58] telling me that you are not a child of
[1:05:00] God? Are you telling me that you are not
[1:05:02] a son of God?
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; You need what is called a ministry for
[1:05:08] you to have a church.
[1:05:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Are you not a child of God? Are you not
[1:05:13] a son of God? And I rather put him on
[1:05:16] the spot this morning. I was I was just
[1:05:18] trying to pull his legs a little bit,
[1:05:20] but I I I I just went in there and I
[1:05:22] found myself, you know, just getting to
[1:05:24] him a little bit. I said, "So, you want
[1:05:25] to tell me you need a ministry
[1:05:29] to tell somebody about the love of
[1:05:31] Jesus?
[1:05:33] You need a ministry to tell somebody
[1:05:35] that God has been good to you." I said,
[1:05:38] "No, don't tell me there, brother."
[1:05:41] I said, "No, no, no. Don't tell me
[1:05:43] there." I said, I said, "Do you see how
[1:05:46] how low we have brought this whole
[1:05:49] thing? How religious that we get?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; That we cannot even tell somebody about
[1:05:54] the goodness of Jesus because I don't
[1:05:56] have a ministry. So, I don't have a
[1:05:58] right to say it.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; I don't have a right to tell somebody of
[1:06:04] how much God has been good to me. I need
[1:06:06] a ministry.
[1:06:09] What we call ministry. What is that?
[1:06:14] What really it is?
[1:06:18] I think much of it I was listening to
[1:06:20] something that really it really it
[1:06:22] really made my mind so uh uh uh I
[1:06:25] forgetting the the guy that that wrote
[1:06:27] it uh an old preacher and it really so
[1:06:31] my thought on that what what what really
[1:06:33] it is. It's just a platform where uh we
[1:06:37] promote ourselves sometimes and many
[1:06:39] times
[1:06:42] or the platform where we just we just uh
[1:06:45] hide ourself. I mean ministry what what
[1:06:47] actually it is.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; God didn't give us ministry. He gave us
[1:06:53] life.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; He gave his life for us. And the
[1:06:56] baptisming of the Holy GHOST IS THE LIFE
[1:06:59] OF Jesus Christ.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AND THAT'S WHAT THE
[1:07:05] WORD NEEDS. THAT'S WHAT THE WORD IS
[1:07:07] DYING FOR. THEY DON'T CARE WHETHER you
[1:07:09] are a bishop or whether you are a
[1:07:11] pastor. They have seen a lot of fake
[1:07:13] ones.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; What it NEED IS THE LIFE OF JESUS
[1:07:19] CHRIST. That's what that's that's what
[1:07:21] the world needs.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Need a MAN OR A WOMAN THAT KNOW THAT
[1:07:26] THEY ARE A SON OR A DAUGHTER OF GOD
[1:07:29] SAVED BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THEY ARE
[1:07:31] NOT ASHAMED ABOUT IT.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:34] HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the word needs.
[1:07:39] Not somebody telling us of how long they
[1:07:41] been in the ministry and how long
[1:07:43] they've been preaching and all the
[1:07:44] things that they have done.
[1:07:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; The good thing there is that how long no
[1:07:50] matter how long you have been, somebody
[1:07:52] has been longer than you.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; So that was a good conversation this
[1:07:59] morning. So I just I just I had to I had
[1:08:00] to gather him quickly because
[1:08:03] We have not talked for a long time and
[1:08:05] he called me. It looks like I was just I
[1:08:07] was just shooting his legs. Amen. I had
[1:08:09] to gather him quickly. I said, "Oh, no,
[1:08:11] no. I'm not I'm not condemning you. You
[1:08:13] know, don't don't think that I'm
[1:08:14] condemning you. I'm happy I'm happy to
[1:08:17] hear from you, but for you to just tell
[1:08:19] me that I don't have a ministry." I
[1:08:22] said, "That took me off guard. I don't
[1:08:24] expect you to say that.
[1:08:29] I don't expect you to Uh even if even if
[1:08:33] there is no church, well there's not a
[1:08:35] message church here, but I'm going to a
[1:08:36] Pentecostal church. Tell me that
[1:08:40] you can't give me an excuse that because
[1:08:42] there is no message church here,
[1:08:45] I'm not a minister.
[1:08:48] Okay, that's for another day. Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; But I mean uh uh uh uh uh uh uh that's
[1:08:54] that's that's exactly what is happening
[1:08:56] here. When our Lord expressed that uh
[1:08:59] that he was thirsted,
[1:09:02] I don't believe that he was looking for
[1:09:04] the water of Jerusalem. I believe he was
[1:09:06] looking for exactly what he said is in
[1:09:08] John chapter 7 because the Holy Ghost
[1:09:11] was not giving yet. And he knew just in
[1:09:15] 40 days,
[1:09:18] JUST IN 40 DAYS. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THAT FOUNTAIN OF
[1:09:24] WATER BURSTING OUT OF those people. AND
[1:09:26] PETER RUNNING RIGHT INTO THE STREET AND
[1:09:28] SAYING, "MAN, AND BRETHREN, REPENT.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I CAN'T WAIT TO see it."
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN ALL THOSE WOMEN, MARY, MAGDALENE,
[1:09:39] AND SOLOMON, and every one of them, they
[1:09:41] will go right into the upper room and
[1:09:43] HE'S GOING TO FILL THEIR GALLON AND FILL
[1:09:46] THEIR BUCKET AND FILL WHATEVER THEY TOOK
[1:09:48] THERE.
[1:09:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:53] and that will become the be the the the
[1:09:55] the
[1:09:57] birth of the church.
[1:10:01] So if his desire is a command to us,
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; My question and thought tonight that I'm
[1:10:11] I'm trying to der on is that are we can
[1:10:14] are we are we ready to break barriers?
[1:10:17] Are we ready to to risk our life like
[1:10:19] those mighty men? Remember they were
[1:10:21] gentile men.
[1:10:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like I said Sunday, uh you
[1:10:28] know I I was just taking that from my
[1:10:30] from my own uh devotion and just
[1:10:32] exulting you on Sunday. But uh uh when
[1:10:35] you just think about it, just think
[1:10:37] about those kind of a people that were
[1:10:38] around around David.
[1:10:42] The Bible said they were distressed.
[1:10:44] They were in depths.
[1:10:48] It just it just described
[1:10:50] some of the things that we deal with
[1:10:52] EVERY DAY. BUT YET IN the midst of that,
[1:10:56] I would tell you that the scripture
[1:10:58] never waited for David TO COME IN POWER
[1:11:01] AND AND and for David to give those men
[1:11:03] their reward before the Bible called
[1:11:06] them mighty men.
[1:11:09] [clears throat]
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Their position WITH DAVID, THAT'S PART
[1:11:11] OF THEIR LIFE SITUATION AND the things
[1:11:14] that they WERE GOING THROUGH. BUT their
[1:11:15] position with David
[1:11:18] Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; THEIR POSITION FOR THE WORD OF GOD,
[1:11:24] their desire to be able to do something
[1:11:26] for the kingdom, that's what God saw in
[1:11:30] them and called them mighty.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Their desire to do something FOR THE
[1:11:39] KINGDOM. WHATEVER IT IS, THEY they they
[1:11:42] really can't put their hands on it, but
[1:11:44] they want to do something to make sure
[1:11:46] that David comes back or David comes to
[1:11:49] the throne.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; And it is that desire in them that God
[1:11:59] looks at and he says, "These men are
[1:12:01] mighty men."
[1:12:04] Praise the Lord. BECAUSE IT WAS THAT
[1:12:07] DESIRE THAT WILL make them to risk their
[1:12:09] life. It's that desire that will make
[1:12:12] them want to jump in in a HOLE WITH A
[1:12:15] LION ON A SNOWY DAY. IT WAS THAT DESIRE
[1:12:18] that will MAKE ONE TO FIGHT THOUSANDS OF
[1:12:21] MEN UNTIL HIS arm is tired, but he's
[1:12:24] still fighting.
[1:12:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Just that desire to be able to do
[1:12:33] something
[1:12:36] for the Lord.
[1:12:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it is,
[1:12:45] but uh if God will be able to look look
[1:12:49] in our age today
[1:12:52] and looking for mighty men,
[1:12:56] they will not just only be the
[1:12:58] missionaries on the field. Because
[1:13:00] brother Brandham says sometimes
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; the thing that make those men to
[1:13:04] accomplish great things,
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; he said it's the housewife that's on her
[1:13:09] knees pray.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; He says it's the mother that is uh that
[1:13:14] is taking some time to fast and seek the
[1:13:16] face of God. That's right.
[1:13:20] [clears throat]
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; They said we want to see the man on on
[1:13:22] the on the pulpit preaching or we we see
[1:13:24] the man on the field winning souls but
[1:13:28] there is somebody that is crying Lord
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; save somebody.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And when God look down
[1:13:36] in our age, WHEN HE'S LOOKING FOR MIGHTY
[1:13:39] MEN AND MIGHTY WOMEN,
[1:13:43] it's not it's not just one that, you
[1:13:46] know, leave all her own responsibility,
[1:13:48] put Bible on her arm and walking all
[1:13:50] down the street trying to win souls.
[1:13:52] Well, if you have that grace, that's
[1:13:53] wonderful.
[1:13:58] We must also have a scripture to back it
[1:14:00] up. Amen.
[1:14:03] It's not just a a man or a woman that is
[1:14:06] just uh wrapped up and consumed in their
[1:14:09] zeal.
[1:14:10] Praise the Lord. Until they say things
[1:14:13] out of zeal and they don't they don't
[1:14:15] they don't even know what is coming from
[1:14:17] their mouth or whatever is coming from.
[1:14:19] They are just talking out of zeal. But
[1:14:22] it's that desire,
[1:14:24] it's that painful desire
[1:14:27] that says, "Lord, before my eyes closed
[1:14:30] on this earth, give me the grace to
[1:14:33] leave one soul to you.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Let me have one soul on my account."
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Before I close my eyes and leave this
[1:14:47] word, Lord, I want to do something for
[1:14:50] you. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And that thing constantly become a
[1:14:59] painful desire.
[1:15:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:08] Amen.
[1:15:11] Brother Bannon will go ahead and and and
[1:15:12] he will say
[1:15:15] [clears throat]
[1:15:22] praise the Lord.
[1:15:32] Let's continue to read.
[1:15:43] He said thirst is a natural thing.
[1:15:48] It's just simply something that God has
[1:15:50] given us that we could to give us a
[1:15:56] desire for something.
[1:16:00] God has always
[1:16:02] has given you a control tower,
[1:16:06] something that is set inside of you that
[1:16:09] control
[1:16:11] these different desires.
[1:16:14] This control tower that that sits in in
[1:16:18] a man's heart is something that God gave
[1:16:21] to warn him of the desire there's
[1:16:26] needful for him. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:29] Amen. Because he knows that the desire
[1:16:32] could be China. He He created that
[1:16:34] thirst. He created that channel in us
[1:16:38] for us to desire.
[1:16:41] Praise the Lord. Amen. like you know
[1:16:44] like sometimes I I when I when I'm
[1:16:47] talking to some young people I tell them
[1:16:49] I say uh uh uh in as much as is true
[1:16:52] that uh you know is is the man that will
[1:16:55] come and speak to the woman it does not
[1:16:57] take the desire of the woman
[1:17:00] to be able to want a good man.
[1:17:05] So that's the reason why she has the
[1:17:07] right to say yes or no. Why? because she
[1:17:10] also has a desire.
[1:17:14] Praise the Lord. For as much as is the
[1:17:17] man that is going TO PROPOSE, SHE ALSO
[1:17:20] HAS the right to say no.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Or to say yes. Why? Because she has a
[1:17:28] desire.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God did not strip her
[1:17:31] of a desire.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But my father, he told Eve, "Your
[1:17:38] desire will be after your husband."
[1:17:40] So, Brother Bram said, "Yeah." So, God
[1:17:43] set a control tower in us just to be
[1:17:46] able to warn us
[1:17:48] because that desire COULD COULD BE
[1:17:51] SHIFTED for the wrong thing.
[1:17:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; That desire could be shifted for the
[1:18:00] wrong thing. And and and he don't want
[1:18:02] us to use it for the wrong thing. He
[1:18:04] want us to use it for the God-given
[1:18:07] thing. Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:17] So when you think about it,
[1:18:23] you think about it, David right there
[1:18:26] speaking to his man and just and just
[1:18:28] saying it. I mean when we went through
[1:18:30] the whole story of how this man became
[1:18:33] David's mighty man. I mean I re I really
[1:18:35] enjoy sitting up in the night and just
[1:18:37] and just reading about it and just
[1:18:39] studing about it. More of that I will
[1:18:41] bring to you in in the future. But
[1:18:44] actually that that was what was on my
[1:18:46] mind. How God look at might.
[1:18:50] His strength is made perfect in our
[1:18:53] weakness.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:18:56] how he look at might when he says love
[1:18:59] the Lord with all of your strength.
[1:19:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:07] And not our abilities, people,
[1:19:11] not even our achievement.
[1:19:15] Glory be to God.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; But it is something that he gave.
[1:19:21] It's something that God gave us.
[1:19:25] It's something that he deposit in our
[1:19:28] life.
[1:19:29] Praise the Lord. Wanting us to give it
[1:19:33] back to him.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Just like I believe he was not thirsting
[1:19:44] after
[1:19:46] natural water.
[1:19:48] So I believe today that his thirst is
[1:19:53] for the young man or the young woman.
[1:19:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] It's for the young man, a young woman or
[1:20:03] uh uh for every one of us
[1:20:08] just like I said to bring forth that
[1:20:10] living water
[1:20:11] out of our life.
[1:20:16] that you have to remember Jesus called a
[1:20:18] living water. He said out of your belly
[1:20:20] will flow rivers of living water
[1:20:24] which mean it has to do with something
[1:20:26] with our daily life.
[1:20:30] Amen.
[1:20:32] Our everyday life
[1:20:35] just bringing something that will please
[1:20:38] him.
[1:20:40] Maybe it is not one of these uh big uh
[1:20:42] uh uh thing of uh you know uh uh getting
[1:20:46] a group of people to listen to you
[1:20:48] because you are testifying
[1:20:51] but some
[1:20:54] some sense of kindness.
[1:20:57] Praise the Lord. Sometimes they don't
[1:20:59] even have to be to strangers.
[1:21:05] Sometimes even the ones that is dear
[1:21:07] close to you,
[1:21:09] your wife, your husband, your your your
[1:21:11] children,
[1:21:13] brothers and sisters,
[1:21:16] some level of kindness h uh in a sense
[1:21:20] of of of of fellowship, something that
[1:21:23] uh you know you will that that that will
[1:21:25] be able to to to touch the life of the
[1:21:27] person.
[1:21:30] Maybe some kind of a for help
[1:21:36] or just a word of gratitude.
[1:21:43] Well, thank you. I mean, you you're
[1:21:45] being you I mean, you you really being
[1:21:47] there for me.
[1:21:50] I I appreciate it.
[1:21:52] I don't say it all the time, but I just
[1:21:54] want to tell you there.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:05] Just like Solomon will say, he says good
[1:22:08] news
[1:22:09] from a distance.
[1:22:12] He says it's just like a cold glass of
[1:22:15] water.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good news.
[1:22:20] So you take it like that. Not only a
[1:22:22] good news, but goodness.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Goodness from a distance. Goodness that
[1:22:27] is that is unexpected.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; GOODNESS THAT IS NOT BEGFUL BUT IT'S
[1:22:33] UNEXPECTED.
[1:22:36] When you can have that grace and that
[1:22:38] talk of the Holy Ghost just to go and
[1:22:41] estroise and say I just thought about
[1:22:44] you.
[1:22:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:50] that the person was just, "Wow,
[1:22:54] I I don't I don't I don't even feel like
[1:22:56] eating this. I just I just want to set
[1:22:58] it down on you." That's just what David
[1:23:01] did. I don't feel like drinking this.
[1:23:04] This man jeopardized their life for me.
[1:23:06] I just want to pour it down. I'll pour I
[1:23:08] I I'll give a drink offering to the
[1:23:11] Lord.
[1:23:14] Praise the Lord. Sometimes we we We
[1:23:18] overlook these things.
[1:23:21] Amen. We overlook the way we treat one
[1:23:25] another. We become so common to one
[1:23:28] another that we overlook the way we
[1:23:31] treat one another. The things we say to
[1:23:34] one another. It's so easy to say hurtful
[1:23:37] things than to say appreciative things.
[1:23:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:45] What we have to realize is his body.
[1:23:50] Is his body. God's people is his body.
[1:23:54] Praise the Lord. Amen. Your parents are
[1:23:58] part of that body. Your children are
[1:24:00] part of that body. Your spouses are part
[1:24:02] of that body. The people you come to
[1:24:04] church with are part of that body.
[1:24:08] Sometimes
[1:24:10] we overlook it. We are looking to great
[1:24:13] things. We are looking to, you know,
[1:24:15] what what we can do uh uh uh uh uh you
[1:24:20] know to be to be part of a mission work
[1:24:22] and to be part of all of those things
[1:24:24] are beautiful.
[1:24:26] The Lord will place it on your heart.
[1:24:29] But sometimes
[1:24:31] the mission field that is so close to
[1:24:33] us, the mission field right in our own
[1:24:36] house,
[1:24:38] the mission field in our own church.
[1:24:43] Praise the Lord. Amen. The mission field
[1:24:46] in our own church, we have a mission
[1:24:49] field in our own house
[1:24:52] to make sure our children have prayer
[1:24:54] life, to make sure they are reading the
[1:24:56] word
[1:24:58] and is to to be able to find that way
[1:25:04] to communicate it, that way to be able
[1:25:06] to capture them. Can you imagine
[1:25:09] that? He's looking for that fresh drink
[1:25:11] of water
[1:25:14] where it's so painful on your heart. You
[1:25:16] are just thinking, "How can I bring
[1:25:18] this? How can I bring this
[1:25:24] for my child to be able to grab it?
[1:25:26] Lord,
[1:25:28] get a hold of them before this word."
[1:25:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:35] Can you imagine what a feeling it brings
[1:25:38] to the father that you realize that
[1:25:42] right in your own house is a mission
[1:25:44] field.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:04] Oh, because you hear those things very
[1:26:06] quickly. You hear it. So now we start
[1:26:09] to, you know, uh uh get out of order.
[1:26:13] Then we feel uh a little bit righteous
[1:26:15] than the other person. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; We feel more spiritual than the other
[1:26:20] person.
[1:26:22] I see you're not even reading your
[1:26:24] Bible. You are not even praying. You are
[1:26:25] not even uh you know, what are we doing
[1:26:28] about it?
[1:26:32] Are we carrying a painful desire in our
[1:26:34] heart
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; to be able to reach out
[1:26:40] to the ones that is around us or to be
[1:26:43] able to find another approach? Maybe I'm
[1:26:46] not going about it the right way.
[1:26:52] There's something that would bring
[1:26:54] pleasure to the father.
[1:26:57] Something that would quench a good news
[1:27:00] from a distance.
[1:27:02] The angel will be carrying a good news
[1:27:04] like brother Brandon would talk about
[1:27:05] the tutor carrying a news to the father
[1:27:09] and say your son he just break character
[1:27:13] today.
[1:27:15] That was not part of him since I've been
[1:27:17] knowing that boy to really take a day
[1:27:20] and say this day I'm fasting.
[1:27:23] He really broke character today. I'm
[1:27:25] telling you
[1:27:27] that your son really broke character. A
[1:27:29] good news from father
[1:27:32] become a cold glass of water to the
[1:27:33] father.
[1:27:36] Praise the Lord. He can look down and
[1:27:38] says yeah he have his he have his ways.
[1:27:43] She have She's having her ways. But
[1:27:46] there is just a heart. There is just a
[1:27:49] heart of sweetness. There is just a
[1:27:52] heart of service.
[1:27:55] Just a heart of service.
[1:27:59] Not doing it because I want some kind of
[1:28:01] a return.
[1:28:06] Doing it because I think it's the right
[1:28:08] thing to do. I don't do this all the
[1:28:11] time, but I just feel like I must do it
[1:28:14] today. Praise the Lord. You say whatever
[1:28:16] you want to say it about me, but I just
[1:28:18] feel like I must do it today.
[1:28:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:26] Or maybe I can go a little bit length,
[1:28:28] you know, calling the sister or calling
[1:28:31] the brother and says, "Well, uh, well,
[1:28:33] let's just meet for coffee this
[1:28:35] Saturday."
[1:28:38] Because most of the time when you call
[1:28:40] people the first thing that comes to
[1:28:41] their mind, what have I done?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's the first thing that comes to
[1:28:46] their mind. What have I done? Oh my god.
[1:28:49] This brother say you want to see me or
[1:28:50] this sister said you want to see me Lord
[1:28:52] Jesus.
[1:28:55] Then you start you start thinking that
[1:28:57] okay when we were in service the last
[1:28:59] time she was sitting there she look at
[1:29:01] me. Maybe
[1:29:04] maybe that's something she want to talk
[1:29:05] about. The way she was looking at my
[1:29:06] clothes and and your mind is just going
[1:29:08] all over the place.
[1:29:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. I just I just want to first I
[1:29:18] just wanted to visit with you.
[1:29:24] You see that kind of a sense of
[1:29:26] refreshment that it brings? You just, oh
[1:29:29] wow,
[1:29:31] oh wow, what a feeling.
[1:29:36] But what what what I want us to think
[1:29:38] about is that this is something that
[1:29:41] brings pleasure to the father
[1:29:48] because Jesus says out of us
[1:29:52] out of us will come living water
[1:29:56] out of us. It's in you.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] It's in you because he put it there.
[1:30:10] It just at that time it could not be
[1:30:12] released. He had to go
[1:30:16] and go and turn the process on in in in
[1:30:18] heaven for it to be released. But it's
[1:30:21] in you. Kindness is in you.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Forgiveness is in you. It's there.
[1:30:29] He put it there.
[1:30:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Repentance is in you. Some of the things
[1:30:37] that you think is the difficult thing
[1:30:39] that you cannot do is dead.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; You have just only allowed a human
[1:30:47] nature THAT YOU GOT SO USED to
[1:30:51] to cover it, but it's there.
[1:30:55] Praise the Lord. Just spend a little
[1:30:57] time before the Lord. You will see you
[1:30:58] will take it away. You will not realize
[1:31:00] that. Oh wow. I thought I could never do
[1:31:03] this.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; I thought I could never do this. Oh my
[1:31:06] god. It's there. He put it there.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; ALMOST JUST LIKE HEALING. IT'S THERE.
[1:31:15] It's in our body.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; It's there.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; It's there.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:28] Sometimes you there are things you think
[1:31:30] about, oh man, how how can I ever do
[1:31:33] this? Oh wow, you're one of the common
[1:31:35] things. Let me bring that one.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:40] Sinking special.
[1:31:44] Praise the Lord. Oh, I can't stand
[1:31:47] before people. I don't know how to stand
[1:31:50] before it, but it's there.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:53] Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Do you know how many angels that come by
[1:31:57] when you singing in your house?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You even have you have heavenly host
[1:32:04] listening to you because you are
[1:32:06] singing. Whether you are in tune or not
[1:32:08] out of tune, they're not listening to
[1:32:10] your words. They're listening to the
[1:32:11] praise that is coming from your heart.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; But then you just feel like I can do it.
[1:32:19] I don't know. I don't know how to do it.
[1:32:21] But it's there.
[1:32:24] You have just allowed a certain thing to
[1:32:27] cloud your mind to think that you cannot
[1:32:30] do it.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know how people pray and then
[1:32:38] they spend
[1:32:40] one hour before God. It's in you.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; It's there. It's in you.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; You just allow YOUR MIND TO CLOUD you to
[1:32:48] think that you cannot do it. But if you
[1:32:50] let go,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; you will let go.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord,
[1:33:02] out of your belly will flow rivers of
[1:33:06] water. Rivers of water.
[1:33:10] Which mean you can give it once, you can
[1:33:13] give it again.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:18] You can give it once, you can give it
[1:33:20] again, you can give it to the the most
[1:33:23] difficult person you think you cannot
[1:33:24] give it to, you can give it to them.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[1:33:45] His desire.
[1:33:50] Just his desire.
[1:33:53] His desire
[1:33:55] for someone
[1:34:00] to spend time with him.
[1:34:03] his desire for someone
[1:34:07] to pray for someone
[1:34:11] to really just shout in and say this
[1:34:13] this uh this 30 minutes of my day is for
[1:34:16] him. His desire of just having 30
[1:34:19] minutes with someone is in you. If you
[1:34:23] really organize yourself and you think
[1:34:26] you can do it and you put alarm on your
[1:34:28] phone to remind you, you will do it
[1:34:31] because it's in you to do it.
[1:34:36] desire to overcome is in you today.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; No matter what the habit is, no matter
[1:34:43] what whatever it is is uh you think that
[1:34:47] is becoming your identity
[1:34:50] but the ability to overcome is in you
[1:34:56] out of your belly.
[1:34:59] flow of some of water, living water. He
[1:35:02] said
[1:35:04] something that would bring pleasure to
[1:35:06] the father
[1:35:08] and sometimes it will even bring
[1:35:10] pleasure to yourself. You feel good
[1:35:12] about it.
[1:35:14] You be grateful that God has given you
[1:35:16] grace in certain areas of your life.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:29] be grateful. You're not doing it because
[1:35:31] of whoever the person is or doing it
[1:35:34] because of uh No, you're doing it
[1:35:36] because you want to bring a cold glass
[1:35:39] of water to your father.
[1:35:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:49] The musicians can come tonight. I think
[1:35:52] I tried to to achieve what I wanted to
[1:35:54] get to tonight.
[1:35:56] Praise the Lord to be able to show you
[1:35:58] that the way that God look at might is
[1:36:01] different. It's different from our
[1:36:03] muscles is different from our our our
[1:36:06] outward dedication, you know, our
[1:36:09] outward commitment. When God look at
[1:36:12] might, you look at how how
[1:36:17] the the the the hunger you have in your
[1:36:20] heart, the the longing you have in your
[1:36:22] heart, the longing
[1:36:31] I pray that God will be able to help
[1:36:33] each and every one of us to be able to
[1:36:36] break barriers to be to be to be a
[1:36:39] mighty man, not a mighty man of David, a
[1:36:42] mighty man of Jesus.
[1:36:45] The garrison of the Philistines filled
[1:36:47] Jerusalem, but yet they were able to go
[1:36:49] through there to get in water.
[1:36:52] There might be a bunch of garrison
[1:36:54] around you and reasons why you can't do
[1:36:56] certain things and reasons why you think
[1:36:58] it's difficult.
[1:37:04] But if his desire is a command to you,
[1:37:07] you will break barriers.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You will go against
[1:37:12] even your better judgment.
[1:37:20] Praise the Lord. Sometimes there are

[1:42:03] us, Father God, [music]
[1:42:05] going across barriers, Lord. Barriers,
[1:42:08] things that have [music and singing]

[1:42:55] something beyond our character. [music]
[1:42:57] It's so easy for us to stay, Lord, for
[1:43:00] us to just stay in their comfort zone,
[1:43:02] Lord. But those men went out of their
[1:43:05] comfort zone
[1:43:08] to bring
[1:43:10] a cold glass of water. [music]
[1:43:14] We can go out of our comfort zone,
[1:43:16] Father.

[1:43:30] to be on time for church.
[1:43:50] Your father
[1:43:55] You have a thirst, Lord.
[1:43:58] You have a thirst.

[1:44:07] He tied to a thirst.
[1:44:11] He said, "Lord, the the woman that will
[1:44:13] give me a glass of water,
[1:44:18] the woman that will give me water to
[1:44:20] drink
[1:44:23] and she will go beyond
[1:44:26] to even give [music] my camels water to
[1:44:28] drink.
[1:44:33] Father, [music] take us just beyond
[1:44:35] church. Lord,
[1:44:37] take us beyond the wall of this church.
[1:44:40] Let's [music] let's realize that we are
[1:44:41] the church. Let's let realize that
[1:44:44] father god when we are out there when we
[1:44:46] are not in service we are out there
[1:44:49] that's where the real service is going
[1:44:51] on.
[1:44:53] You want us to be in service to the
[1:44:55] people around us in service to our our
[1:44:58] children our loved ones
[1:45:01] our coworker.
[1:45:05] Not always, not always to be self, but
[1:45:07] you want us to be in service.
[1:45:10] And sometimes you want us to go beyond
[1:45:13] Lord.
[1:45:15] Just go beyond
[1:45:21] especially, Father God,
[1:45:25] this season
[1:45:27] that the word has has [music]
[1:45:28] commercialized. Father God, but your
[1:45:31] prophet said that Christmas is [music]
[1:45:34] worship.
[1:45:35] Christmas is a season of worship to
[1:45:38] remember the greatest gift that God gave
[1:45:40] to the world.
[1:45:43] And that we ourselves we can give
[1:45:45] something in return. Lord, I pray to
[1:45:47] God. Father,
[1:45:49] be with our hearts, oh God. Be with our
[1:45:53] hearts, Lord Jesus.
[1:46:00] be with our hearts Lord Father God.
[1:46:03] [music]
[1:46:05] We just don't want to be oh God father
[1:46:12] Christians just by identifying with a
[1:46:14] church.
[1:46:18] We want to bring praise to you.
[1:46:21] We want our life let our life be to your
[1:46:24] pleasure. Father, [music]
[1:46:25] you can look down upon us, Lord God, in
[1:46:28] our bedroom
[1:46:30] and be so glad that Father God,
[1:46:34] we are singing a [music] song. We are
[1:46:37] reading our Bible.
[1:46:42] Oh, Father, we are just we just talking

[1:46:51] because those two men on the road of
[1:46:53] Emiras, they was talking about you and

[1:47:06] Father, [music] we're going into soon
[1:47:08] going into a year, Lord Jesus, that we
[1:47:10] don't know what is bringing.
[1:47:14] We want to go

[1:47:19] to step into [music] new experience with
[1:47:21] you, Father.
[1:47:26] Lord God, we want to learn to challenge
[1:47:28] ourself every day.
[1:47:32] Whether it's just to drink enough water,
[1:47:36] whether it's to take a walk,
[1:47:39] whether it's in our prayer life,
[1:47:44] we just can't be [music] to where we
[1:47:46] are.
[1:47:52] I pray, Father, that [music] you help
[1:47:53] us, Lord,
[1:47:57] even this local assembly, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:01] Oh God,
[1:48:04] let it be a lighthouse, Lord,
[1:48:08] even though many have said this
[1:48:10] lighthouse should be teared down.
[1:48:14] But Father, let it be a lighthouse,
[1:48:15] [music] oh God, while we stayed at the
[1:48:18] corner of the street, Lord.
[1:48:20] Let the atmosphere of Jesus, let the

[1:48:28] together Wednesday night, we come

[1:48:31] Lord, I pray, oh God, may we come with a
[1:48:35] purpose, Lord. May we come with a
[1:48:37] [music] desire, Lord. May we come, oh
[1:48:39] God, Father, with something burning in
[1:48:41] our heart, Lord, just, oh God, to be
[1:48:44] part of the service. Not to be a
[1:48:46] spectator, Lord, but to enter in with
[1:48:48] you, Father. Enter into the worship, oh
[1:48:51] God. Enter into the praise, [music]
[1:48:53] enter into the prayer, Father, Lord God.
