[48:25] Lord.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And uh but it didn't work out and and so

[48:54] well uh thank you musicians. That will
[48:56] be all for the music.
[48:58] That will be all for the music.
[49:07] I wanted to to really sing some songs
[49:09] this morning, but uh uh I I didn't know
[49:12] where I left my dancing shoes, so I I
[49:16] just took another one. Praise the Lord.
[49:19] Amen.
[49:21] Well, we we just uh thank the Lord and
[49:24] and uh this morning we we want to do
[49:27] something. I want to recap on some
[49:29] things. I really been trying to find my
[49:32] way back to what we've been speaking on
[49:34] before we travel. So, uh uh I would try
[49:39] to do some recap this morning. But then,
[49:43] uh in the midst of the recap, I also uh
[49:46] been thinking about a subject. Many
[49:48] years ago, I was preaching for brother
[49:50] Elijah Jebu that do uh uh come come and
[49:54] speak for us here over in Liberia. I
[49:56] can't remember when that was, but I I
[49:59] was I was speaking for him
[50:01] and then uh I went there talking about
[50:05] something and and I started talking
[50:06] about uh uh how
[50:11] uh sometimes
[50:14] we play God.
[50:16] How we play God. You know, as children
[50:20] sometimes we we play uh children we play
[50:23] father and mother. You are the mother.
[50:25] you are the father, you are the your
[50:27] teacher, you know, I'm the student. You
[50:29] know, children play those things. And we
[50:32] we are very fond of uh talking about uh
[50:37] uh uh encouraging oursel not to play
[50:39] church. Praise the Lord.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; And and we see people playing church and
[50:45] people play religion.
[50:48] But uh uh I I thought about how also
[50:52] people play God
[50:54] and the thought of playing God is uh
[50:57] sometimes you find that uh in in in many
[51:00] forms of relationship. Uh sometimes we
[51:04] play God in the in the life of our
[51:06] children you know uh uh I mean we should
[51:09] be parents we should be guidance but
[51:11] their destiny is in God's hand.
[51:14] Sometimes in the in the life of our our
[51:17] spouses, we play God. You know, you
[51:20] think that maybe without you, the person
[51:22] cannot exist. I mean, that's that just
[51:24] uh you didn't give birth to them. You
[51:26] didn't give life to them. And uh uh all
[51:29] of our destiny is in the hands of God.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; So, uh I was just talking in their
[51:35] direction. But after the service, the
[51:37] thought left on me and I went home and
[51:40] and then I started started studying. uh
[51:43] I look at the subject, I make some notes
[51:45] on it, I just left it down. And uh this
[51:48] morning I was going to speak on
[51:50] something completely different. But uh
[51:52] while I was I was uh here yesterday
[51:54] evening studying and praying and uh and
[51:58] in the thought of what I wanted to talk
[52:01] about, this whole thought came back to
[52:03] me about playing God
[52:06] and it just couldn't leave me. So I
[52:08] said, "Well, okay, I'll go back. I
[52:10] couldn't I I really didn't have time to
[52:12] look for my notes because I was looking
[52:14] at something different. So I said, well,
[52:16] okay, I would just I would just uh uh
[52:19] involve it in what I want to talk about
[52:21] this morning. So uh uh what we want to
[52:24] talk about this morning uh Paul uh in
[52:28] the book of 2 Corinthians speak about
[52:30] that when he talk about the mystery of
[52:33] iniquity.
[52:35] So we want to talk about the mystery of
[52:38] iniquity but uh with with the
[52:40] inspiration of playing God or with a sub
[52:44] subject of playing God. And uh and I
[52:47] think if there is ever a time ever a
[52:50] time where men try to play God, you
[52:53] know, sometimes the government try to
[52:55] play God and uh you know our leaders try
[52:59] to play God, sometimes uh pastors try to
[53:02] play God in the lives of the people. So
[53:05] we want to look at that this morning.
[53:06] Amen. and just pray that the Holy Spirit
[53:09] will be able to bless uh uh the
[53:12] inspiration and then uh uh make it
[53:15] meaningful to us. Praise the Lord.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Like I always say, I'm not a teacher,
[53:19] but I will try this morning uh because
[53:22] uh uh I I put some images together. I
[53:26] went back and took the image that
[53:27] brother Feed the other night when he
[53:30] spoke to us. I will I will visit the
[53:33] preacher from overseas. uh uh went back
[53:36] and took that image because
[53:39] uh it was part of uh uh of my subject.
[53:42] Like I said, he went he you know, he
[53:44] actually throw me into the water. He
[53:46] pushed me. So I have to swim. Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; He pushed me. So I have to swim. If I
[53:52] don't swim, I will drown. Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. So I have to swim. He actually
[53:56] pushed me. I was trying to take my time
[53:58] to come to that and he really really
[54:00] pushed me. So I have to swim. Praise the
[54:03] Lord. Amen. Amen. So, uh uh the Lord
[54:07] bless you this morning. I hope uh we
[54:10] have a good time in uh around the word
[54:12] of the Lord. That's the reason why we
[54:14] are here this morning. Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; So, let's just stand on our feet and uh
[54:20] let's stand on our feet. We will take
[54:22] our Bibles. Uh if the the
[54:28] if uh the technicians are ready back
[54:31] there, they will bring me pointer and
[54:34] then we will we will start off but we go
[54:37] over to the book of second Thessalonian.
[54:41] We go over to the book of second test
[54:44] and that I mean as we as we stroll into
[54:47] the book if you are familiar with what
[54:50] Paul said to the Thessalonians you will
[54:53] know exactly
[54:55] why we titled this plain God.
[54:59] Praise the Lord.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Because that's exactly what the man of
[55:03] sin will be doing. He will be playing
[55:05] God. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh, 2
[55:10] Thessalonians chapter 2. Let's read from
[55:12] verse one this morning. Praise the Lord.
[55:15] I hope you have I hope you had a
[55:17] breakfast or you have a cup of tea this
[55:19] morning. If you didn't, I never also.
[55:21] Amen. So, I will know just exactly how
[55:24] you feel. I don't want to I don't want
[55:26] to hold you on the grounding of my
[55:28] stomach because my stomach ground all
[55:29] the time. Sometimes the children ask me,
[55:32] "Daddy, what is talking there?" I said,
[55:33] "Well, you know,
[55:37] that's my owner children talking in my
[55:38] stomach." Praise the Lord.
[55:42] Amen. So, uh, you ready for the word
[55:45] this morning?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope, uh, I hope we all we have
[55:50] a good time. I hope that the spirit of
[55:52] lord will just uh come in our midst and
[55:55] just give us a wonderful time. Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Visitors just there with us. That's the
[55:59] way we are. Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; And I hope uh we will not offend you.
[56:04] But sometimes, you know, we have
[56:06] something to offend everybody. Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometimes it's uh it's
[56:11] not intentional, but uh uh because it's
[56:14] the word of the Lord. Second
[56:16] Thessalonians chapter 2. Now we beseech
[56:18] you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord
[56:21] Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
[56:24] together unto him,
[56:27] that ye be now shaken in mind, or be
[56:33] troubled, neither by spirit, none by
[56:37] word, none by letter, as from us,
[56:43] as that the day of Christ is at hand.
[56:47] There's a big history behind this. I
[56:49] will read and then I will allow you to
[56:51] to sit and then I will go a little bit
[56:53] into that. Let no man deceive you by any
[56:57] means for that day shall not come except
[57:00] there come a falling away first and the
[57:04] man of sin be revealed the son of
[57:08] pedition. Praise the Lord. The man of
[57:11] sin be revealed, the son of pition
[57:15] who opposes and exalt exalted himself
[57:19] above all that is called God, all that
[57:23] is worship
[57:24] so that he as God sitted in the temple
[57:28] of God
[57:30] showing himself as he is God. So this
[57:34] guy is playing God.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. So we have a prophecy here that uh
[57:40] yeah that is the antichrist. We have a
[57:42] prophecy in the in the Bible where there
[57:45] will be a man that will try to play God.
[57:48] Amen. A man that that says he can
[57:52] forgive your sin. A man you know and all
[57:54] of that. But uh uh uh uh we know that
[57:59] that is a prophecy and that prophecy
[58:01] will crown uh an individual that the
[58:05] Bible called the man of sin, the son of
[58:07] pedition. There will be a man word that
[58:10] prophecy will crown. That word will
[58:12] embody in that man.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; But until then, it's a spirit.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit right from Genesis. Yeah,
[58:24] &gt;&gt; there has been making
[58:27] people to play God. Be making us to play
[58:30] God.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Let me say, let me make it general this
[58:33] way because you see uh uh uh that's
[58:36] that's what Satan did. Let me not go
[58:39] ahead of myself, but Genesis chapter
[58:41] three, we will get there. He told he
[58:44] told Eve that you will be as God.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And and and she was already gone because
[58:53] she was a daughter of God. She came out
[58:55] of God. You see, when you are asked, you
[58:58] are played.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; So I I that's where we go in this point.
[59:06] So let's just read.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember
[59:10] ye net that
[59:15] when I was yet with you I told you these
[59:17] things and now you know what withhold it
[59:23] that he might be revealed in his time
[59:26] for the mystery of iniquity and that's
[59:29] what I call the mystery of iniquity the
[59:31] mystery of iniquity is uh is is plain
[59:35] gone I will explain why I say that I
[59:38] explain to you the mystery of iniquity
[59:41] does already work. So you see Paul
[59:44] saying it's already working among us.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; That mystery of iniquity is robbing us
[59:50] of our potential of being sons and
[59:53] daughters of God. We are not coming to
[59:55] that full potential of what God want us
[59:58] to be. But we are playing it
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; instead of living it.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Instead of being what we supposed to be,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; we are playing it. It's two different
[1:00:08] things.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; You can play a manager.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; You can be a manager.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You can play a husband.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; You can be a husband.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; It's different from playing a wife
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; than being a wife.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:33] For the mission of iniquity does already
[1:00:36] work.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Only he who now leth will let until he
[1:00:41] be taken out of the way.
[1:00:44] And then shall the wicked be revealed
[1:00:46] whom the Lord shall consume with the
[1:00:48] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:00:51] with the brightness of his coming.
[1:00:55] Even him whose coming is after the
[1:00:58] working of Satan with all powers and and
[1:01:01] and signs and lying wonders.
[1:01:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; And with all
[1:01:11] deceit of unrighteousness in them that
[1:01:15] perish because they receive not the love
[1:01:18] of the truth that they might be saved.
[1:01:20] The Lord bless you. You may have the
[1:01:23] comfort of your seat.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; And if the seat is not comfortable, let
[1:01:29] us know.
[1:01:31] Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because we want you to
[1:01:34] be comfortable.
[1:01:36] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory be to God.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; He is good. He's a good God.
[1:01:50] The Lord is good.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; What what an awesome God we serve. And
[1:01:59] uh uh brother
[1:02:02] young Emmanuel, are we ready?
[1:02:05] Are we ready back there? Okay.
[1:02:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:12] Amen.
[1:02:14] So if you if you have me put up my first
[1:02:17] uh slide, okay, that's uh that's my uh
[1:02:21] uh the title of my message.
[1:02:23] Uh the the mystery of iniquity, playing
[1:02:27] God,
[1:02:29] oppose and exaltth himself above all
[1:02:32] that is called God, worship, and he
[1:02:36] seeded in the temple of God. He sure
[1:02:38] himself as God.
[1:02:40] We will come to that. We'll come to
[1:02:42] that. Let's let's just get a little
[1:02:44] background of uh uh a little get a
[1:02:49] little background of uh what uh the
[1:02:51] subject
[1:02:53] is. Go to the next slide. Some this
[1:02:55] thing is not moving
[1:02:59] now. So uh in in the next slide here uh
[1:03:03] uh there are some uh this thing is too
[1:03:07] small but I'll read it for you so you
[1:03:10] can you won't be able to strain your
[1:03:11] eyes. Now the background behind second
[1:03:17] testimony is that uh good to see you
[1:03:20] sister masa.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just sink in. Amen. Uh uh uh
[1:03:28] the background behind second
[1:03:29] Thessalonian is that the you read a book
[1:03:33] of of Thessalonian, you realize that
[1:03:36] Paul had to write second Thessalonian
[1:03:41] as as uh reburdened. He was he was he
[1:03:44] was replying something that came up in
[1:03:46] the church.
[1:03:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; He was replying something that came up
[1:03:52] in the church. If you look at verse two
[1:03:55] again, he says that ye be not Don't
[1:03:57] Don't change it. Just leave the slide
[1:03:59] up. that ye be not soon shaken in in in
[1:04:03] your mind or be troubled, neither by
[1:04:06] spirit, not by words or a letter from us
[1:04:10] as that the day of Christ be at hand.
[1:04:13] You see, because what was happening here
[1:04:15] is that uh you read the book of Acts,
[1:04:19] you hear word uh in in in the first
[1:04:22] three, four chapter, Peter and James
[1:04:24] were wicked. But when the Roman
[1:04:27] government actually started putting
[1:04:30] pressure on the church, when the
[1:04:31] persecution started on the church, it
[1:04:34] started in Thessalonica.
[1:04:38] Praise the Lord. So when this
[1:04:40] persecution started and uh uh uh uh when
[1:04:44] when when you read down here,
[1:04:48] you will see where the it says that uh
[1:04:52] uh uh that's that's where the
[1:04:54] persecution began. It was in
[1:04:56] Thessalonica that the first gentile were
[1:04:59] killed by the Roman Empire. The local
[1:05:02] Roman government in that part of the
[1:05:05] country said that every Christian had to
[1:05:07] bow before the statue of Augustus
[1:05:10] Caesars. He had to uh uh he had been
[1:05:14] dearified and and and and the statue of
[1:05:17] Caesar was erected. Every Christian who
[1:05:20] don't obey
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; that it was persecuted.
[1:05:25] So this is what happened. This is why
[1:05:27] Paul wrote them because when this
[1:05:30] persecution started,
[1:05:34] it shocked the believers
[1:05:37] because I call into what were being
[1:05:41] preached. The church must not go through
[1:05:44] the persecution.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; So when the persecution started, they
[1:05:51] started asking, "Well, I thought we
[1:05:53] should be raptured.
[1:05:56] Why is this happening?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Then then a sense of confusion, you
[1:06:03] know. Then they started writing back to
[1:06:05] Paul.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; So do you see the background? That's why
[1:06:11] Paul now have to tell them these things
[1:06:14] have to take place.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Don't be troubled in your faith. So you
[1:06:21] will see that's the reason why in second
[1:06:24] Thessalonian he even talk about the
[1:06:26] rapture
[1:06:29] that all of these things the man of sin
[1:06:32] has to be revealed. The the the the
[1:06:34] mystery of iniquity has to be revealed
[1:06:37] and all of these things have to happen
[1:06:43] before the rapture.
[1:06:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] So Paul was trying to make them to see
[1:06:51] that this is a persecution. This is not
[1:06:54] a tribulation.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; The church will not go through the
[1:07:00] tribulation but we go through
[1:07:01] persecution.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] So you see the way the people receive
[1:07:10] the word and many times like I said
[1:07:12] Wednesday night we go through the same
[1:07:14] thing when when we when we going through
[1:07:17] one trial or another then we start
[1:07:19] asking why am I going through you're
[1:07:21] supposed to know why you're going
[1:07:23] through it because you are a son of God.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are a daughter of
[1:07:27] God.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; You are the only one that God can give
[1:07:30] test to.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; And that is the thing with us. As soon
[1:07:41] as we get through a little thing, uh
[1:07:43] maybe it an illness or maybe we go broke
[1:07:46] or maybe something happened, you know,
[1:07:48] that we we we quick start to look into
[1:07:50] our dark past.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; And that's the thing that was that was
[1:07:56] kind of a troubling the church here
[1:08:00] a little bit. Are we together?
[1:08:03] It was in Thessalonica that uh that the
[1:08:07] dream of uh the procedure of offering
[1:08:11] a cast of wine. That's that's what I
[1:08:14] have right here. It's too little. I
[1:08:15] didn't realize that I got it too small
[1:08:17] like that. uh uh uh to to to cast off
[1:08:21] wine on the altar
[1:08:24] of Venus or or or Caesar and then
[1:08:28] publicly take it out to the marketplace,
[1:08:31] you know, because uh they knew that
[1:08:33] these Christians did not eat things that
[1:08:35] were offered onto idols. So what they
[1:08:38] did, they would do these things, make
[1:08:40] their their idol, you know, sacrifice uh
[1:08:43] and then they come go in the marketplace
[1:08:45] and sprinkle it on the vegetable and the
[1:08:47] leaves.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; And and they were doing it purposely to
[1:08:56] to target the Christians.
[1:09:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:03] So the first major persecution in Bible
[1:09:07] history of the Christian church started
[1:09:10] with the church in Thessalonica.
[1:09:16] So Paul now had to write them back
[1:09:19] quickly
[1:09:21] and tell them don't be troubled. Don't
[1:09:24] be troubled. It's going to be okay.
[1:09:25] Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; It's going to be okay. Don't be
[1:09:28] troubled. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means, for
[1:09:33] that day shall not come except this and
[1:09:37] this and this and this happen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Do you get the background?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Do you get the background? So that's the
[1:09:50] reason why he had to quickly write uh uh
[1:09:54] uh so if you if you just read through
[1:09:57] second Thessalonian you get the picture
[1:10:00] quickly because he's addressing all of
[1:10:01] those things. He putting end time he
[1:10:04] putting end time events into sequence.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; This is going to happen and that is
[1:10:11] going to happen and this is going to
[1:10:13] happen.
[1:10:15] Let nobody deceive you that the rapture
[1:10:17] has taken place. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Because that we we went through a little
[1:10:23] bit of that corona virus. It was oh yeah
[1:10:25] there you know uh uh uh we are in the
[1:10:28] tribulation. Amen. Quickly then
[1:10:31] Christians oh the mark of the beast that
[1:10:33] the vaccine is the mark of the beast and
[1:10:36] the people start carrying all sorts of
[1:10:37] theory around. We we have to we have to
[1:10:40] grow up. Like I said Wednesday night we
[1:10:43] have to grow up.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We has to grow up by
[1:10:47] knowing the word of God that we would
[1:10:49] not be moved when things happen.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Now, so that is our background.
[1:11:08] That is our background of what we want
[1:11:10] to get into this morning. If we if only
[1:11:13] we can be able to. But now you just
[1:11:16] pause that in your mind. I'm going to
[1:11:18] come back to that. Just hold that in
[1:11:20] your mind. Don't go anywhere. Praise the
[1:11:22] Lord.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Don't sleep on me either.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz I will wake you up.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; If I can't call your name, I will knock
[1:11:33] this thing so hard.
[1:11:36] Even though my hands will have to pay
[1:11:38] for it, but I will do it.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; So, you just stay right there. Let's go
[1:11:43] to our next uh uh slide.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Okay, this is where brother
[1:11:52] Fammy left us the other night. He was
[1:11:55] here. It was a Wednesday night and I
[1:11:57] mean it was it was beautiful. Amen.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; The the the presence of the Lord was was
[1:12:01] was reaching the building. The word of
[1:12:04] God was rich. The atmosphere was rich.
[1:12:06] Amen.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I realized that the the
[1:12:13] brother was getting he was getting into
[1:12:15] so much word. Amen. And there are things
[1:12:18] that he wanted to say until he started
[1:12:20] abbreviating certain things. I laugh
[1:12:23] after I laugh at him a little bit. You
[1:12:25] know when he says your service online I
[1:12:27] said preach.
[1:12:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Now so that's just where he left us. Now
[1:12:35] this is the gentile kingdom. uh uh a
[1:12:38] dream uh that was given to
[1:12:40] Nebuchinnezzar.
[1:12:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; A dream that was given to
[1:12:46] Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:12:49] Oh, it's working. Oh my god.
[1:12:54] Praise the Lord. This is where I wanted
[1:12:56] to get. I come back to that. Now, you
[1:12:59] will realize that uh uh uh uh in the
[1:13:02] history of the Bible, I want to grab
[1:13:03] your mind here. Israel had a giant that
[1:13:07] challenged him.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And that giant was uh uh uh
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Goliath. Amen. That giant was Goliath.
[1:13:16] Where is little Samuel? He's the one
[1:13:18] that's supposed to ask that Samuel desto
[1:13:21] Goliath.
[1:13:24] Praise the Lord. And uh and and the
[1:13:28] Israel giant was hit in his head.
[1:13:32] Praise the Lord. David released the
[1:13:35] stone and it hit the giant in his head.
[1:13:39] The Gentiles also had a giant, but our
[1:13:44] giant was more a spiritual giant. Their
[1:13:46] giant was a physical giant.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And our giant was hit in the feet.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; The stone that was cut out of the
[1:14:01] mountain.
[1:14:02] So you will realize here that in in in
[1:14:05] the in the history of the Bible there
[1:14:08] are things that are playing out.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; We see that uh Pharaoh had a dream that
[1:14:15] Joseph had to interpret
[1:14:18] and Pharaoh dream was concerning the
[1:14:20] redemption of the Jews.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:26] So the redemption of the Jews, God will
[1:14:29] give the dream to h a pharaoh. God will
[1:14:34] give the dream to a world leader at the
[1:14:37] time. God will give the dream to an
[1:14:40] unbelieving political world leader.
[1:14:47] Something that concern the redemption of
[1:14:50] his children.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Why? Because it's
[1:14:56] Pharaoh dream that will bring Joseph in
[1:14:59] the picture. And when Joseph give the
[1:15:01] interpretation, Jacob and the rest will
[1:15:04] come back into Egypt or they would come
[1:15:07] into Egypt.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Then the beginning of the exodor will
[1:15:11] start.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; So the dream that he had it was
[1:15:16] concerning the Jews redemption.
[1:15:20] God in in the in the book of Isaiah or
[1:15:23] the Jeremiah called Nebuchadnezzar my
[1:15:26] seven.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; So here say God now is giving another
[1:15:34] Gentile, another unbelieving political
[1:15:37] king.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; He's not a church member.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; But God is giving him a dream.
[1:15:46] And both of them had their dream. They
[1:15:49] woke up from sleep. They can't remember
[1:15:51] it.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; The dream was so troubling.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; The dream has so much impression on
[1:16:00] them, but they couldn't remember it. And
[1:16:02] they really knew that, whoa, I need an
[1:16:05] interpretation to this dream.
[1:16:08] Pharaoh had the same experience.
[1:16:11] Nebuchadnezzar had the same experience.
[1:16:14] But Nebuchadnezzar's dream was
[1:16:17] concerning the gentile redemption.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pass out uh uh a little bit
[1:16:29] of test after after the lecture. So pay
[1:16:32] attention.
[1:16:34] Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; If you don't know the answer, just write
[1:16:38] whatever wherever you remember.
[1:16:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Write it on the tables of your heart.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh uh uh so we see here
[1:16:52] Israel had a giant. He was hit in the
[1:16:54] head. The gentile giant was hit in the
[1:16:56] feet. Alpha and omega.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh had a dream concerning the Jews
[1:17:04] redemption. Nebuchadnezzar had a dream
[1:17:06] concerning the Gentile redemption. You
[1:17:09] see this Bible is the book of life.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; This Bible is not a historical book.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Even right now what we are going on with
[1:17:20] the word economy is right here in this
[1:17:22] Bible.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; So you see when God was doing this uh uh
[1:17:29] uh he was doing this giving these men
[1:17:31] these dreams it was to cover
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; the history of time.
[1:17:37] Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; going too fast. I want to go back. Okay.
[1:17:56] This is where I was. And that's uh uh
[1:17:58] Daniel chapter uh 2:27 to 35.
[1:18:04] Praise the Lord. You read Daniel chapter
[1:18:07] 2 uh uh uh uh 7-35.
[1:18:11] Uh there there is something there. I
[1:18:13] I'll read that later. But let me read
[1:18:15] this to you. This is from uh uh the
[1:18:17] gentile dispensation. Beginning any of
[1:18:19] the gentile dispensation. The way the
[1:18:22] gentile kingdom issue in it will go out
[1:18:25] the same way.
[1:18:27] That's right. By supernatural works,
[1:18:30] supernatural interpretation.
[1:18:32] You know what I'm talking about? The
[1:18:36] working of the supernatural.
[1:18:38] Oh, how marvelous. Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Supernatural dreams, supernatural work,
[1:18:44] supernatural interpretation.
[1:18:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Many times we read this, we we just make
[1:18:51] emphasis with a beginning with a man,
[1:18:53] worship of a man out with a the worship
[1:18:56] of a man. But that was not the only
[1:18:57] thing that was there. The most important
[1:18:59] thing there is that there was a
[1:19:01] supernatural gift
[1:19:04] that was introduced and and and the same
[1:19:06] thing with the g with the Jewish the
[1:19:09] Jewish age. We could read this if we
[1:19:11] were back in the time of of of Joseph.
[1:19:14] It started with a supernatural gift.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; It was this supernatural gift that that
[1:19:21] put Joseph into trouble.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Think about it. You go back there. You
[1:19:27] talk you you you you you read about that
[1:19:29] in Genesis Jacob had a dream. Go back
[1:19:33] and read Jacob's dream. He had two
[1:19:35] dreams.
[1:19:37] The first dream he had was uh uh uh uh
[1:19:42] uh the 12 stars.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Joseph dreams. What? What did I say?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; I said Jacob. Oh my god.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I need to drink water.
[1:19:56] Let Let me drink it down.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Now, so Joseph had this dream. He he he
[1:20:06] had a it was it was all about the 12
[1:20:09] stars. The second dream,
[1:20:13] the moon and the sun was in his dream.
[1:20:18] Now watch this now because
[1:20:21] you know a people that first about a
[1:20:24] prophet word not coming to pass.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Jacob Joseph first dream came to pass.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; When his brothers came and met him in
[1:20:34] Egypt
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; was about the second dream.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Now he will be a false prophet because
[1:20:42] her mother Rachel died.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. before he before
[1:20:46] they came to Egypt.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; So we were saying his prophecy never
[1:20:50] came to pass but his prophecy was
[1:20:52] spiritual because Jacob Joseph's second
[1:20:56] dream is fulfilled in Revelation 12.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; The woman the woman having the the sun
[1:21:11] on her feet. That's the fulfillment of
[1:21:14] Joseph's second dream.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; So you see the when people get fussy and
[1:21:28] and we try to use this our our small
[1:21:31] brain and we think that uh we had read
[1:21:35] enough of of of of the Bible of history
[1:21:38] and you know we get proof. Oh yeah, this
[1:21:40] prophet said it never came to pass. It
[1:21:42] never go back now. Can we should we tear
[1:21:45] that place out of the Bible?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; You will only tear it because you are
[1:21:50] foolish because you don't know that
[1:21:53] these are the words of God. Those men
[1:21:56] were just medium.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; It was not their thinking. They are not
[1:22:00] responsible to fulfill it.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; If God gave a man a prophecy, he's not
[1:22:06] responsible to fulfill it. Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; It might never happen in your lifetime.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; It never happened in their lifetime.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; When Joseph said this thing, his mother
[1:22:23] Rachel was there.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; But the fulfillment of the prophecy, she
[1:22:28] was there. She died in Bethlehem, giving
[1:22:30] birth to Benjamin.
[1:22:38] Are we together?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; So, will y'all just leave us for now?
[1:22:43] You know, we will hold to we will hold
[1:22:45] to it. Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; If you uh uh we'll hold to what the word
[1:22:50] of God says. We'll hold to what prophet
[1:22:52] has said. Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; So, we see here the gentile kingdom
[1:22:57] started in with a supernatural work,
[1:23:00] supernatural interpretation. Amen. This
[1:23:03] was supernatural. Nebuchadnezzar had no
[1:23:06] idea of what this was
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; in so much that he was ready. He was
[1:23:12] ready and determined to kill all his
[1:23:16] magicians, all his astronomers.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; If y'all don't give me an interpretation
[1:23:21] of this, I'm going to whip all these
[1:23:24] people out.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; He was ready. He was ready to just to to
[1:23:32] to to just wipe them all out because uh
[1:23:36] uh uh uh it trouble him.
[1:23:40] He have never had a dream that will
[1:23:42] bother him so much. And and and uh uh
[1:23:46] Pharaoh was willing to do the same.
[1:23:50] Are we together?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; So we we will not go through all of this
[1:23:58] today. We just we're just using this to
[1:24:00] get ourself to where where we want to
[1:24:03] be. So we we realize that uh uh uh uh
[1:24:07] Pharaoh had Pharaoh dream concern the
[1:24:10] redemption of the Jews. Nebuchadnezzar
[1:24:13] dream concerned the redemption of the
[1:24:16] Gentiles. And these two were unbelieving
[1:24:20] idol worshiing
[1:24:22] leaders.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Mhm.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; They were unbelieving idol worshiing.
[1:24:28] The thing that is wrong with our
[1:24:31] society, with our Christianity is that
[1:24:34] sometimes we want to make great we we we
[1:24:36] try to interpret great people life just
[1:24:39] so we can agree with them. We we want to
[1:24:42] make them somewhere they are a believer.
[1:24:44] The person don't have to be a believer
[1:24:46] before God. God made every one of us and
[1:24:48] he can use he made us.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; He can use us for whatever reason. Amen.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible said leaders are raised up and
[1:24:57] set down. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they are ordained of God
[1:25:02] whether you like it or not.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I don't want to get into
[1:25:14] to you know to politics or whatever that
[1:25:17] I don't like bringing it over the poop.
[1:25:19] So let me just stay with what I'm
[1:25:20] preaching. Don't go there at all.
[1:25:23] Let me tell myself, don't go there.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; But these were all un unbelieving,
[1:25:31] unrighteous uh uh men worshiping idols.
[1:25:35] But God gave them supernatural dreams
[1:25:37] concerning his people.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Now, so we we we will see here that uh
[1:25:47] uh uh there in in in in Daniel chapter
[1:25:51] 2. Let's let's go there in Daniel
[1:25:54] chapter 2 quickly.
[1:25:57] Let's go there in Daniel chapter 2
[1:25:59] quickly. Like I said, I'm I'm just I'm
[1:26:02] using this
[1:26:04] uh uh don't don't take the image down.
[1:26:07] Just leave it there. Uh you people back
[1:26:09] there, I don't want to uh give you
[1:26:12] people a lot of lot of trouble. I know
[1:26:13] you got to pull things up and bring
[1:26:15] things down and so just leave it there.
[1:26:18] You already did a a lot of work to get
[1:26:21] it up there. So,
[1:26:24] praise the Lord.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we we sit in the
[1:26:29] seat here and when and when things don't
[1:26:32] come up on the board easily, it's so
[1:26:34] easy for us to feel funny. What are they
[1:26:36] doing back there? Those young people are
[1:26:38] doing a lot of work.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes uh uh
[1:26:45] if you like, you can go visit with them.
[1:26:47] They will show you what they doing.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] Now, so if you look over here in uh uh
[1:27:04] you look over here,
[1:27:09] I'm trying to get
[1:27:12] Okay, you look over here in Daniel
[1:27:14] chapter 2 verse uh 34. That's that's
[1:27:17] what I want to I want to go quickly.
[1:27:19] Like I said, I'm going to come back to
[1:27:20] this as we as we go back as we go
[1:27:22] through the sub. I keep referring back
[1:27:24] to this. So, uh uh it might be for the
[1:27:27] rest of the month or the rest of the
[1:27:29] year. I don't know. But uh so we see
[1:27:32] here that the Bible says in Daniel
[1:27:35] chapter 2 verse uh 34, the Bible says,
[1:27:38] "Thou saw it." Daniel is telling
[1:27:41] Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:27:42] "Thou saw till a stone was cut out out
[1:27:47] with our hands, which which stone the
[1:27:50] image upon his feet that were of iron
[1:27:54] and clay, and break them into pieces."
[1:27:57] Praise the Lord. So, right here, we see
[1:28:00] we we we got an image here uh uh that I
[1:28:04] that I copied from Google. We got an
[1:28:07] image here and and a stone here uh uh
[1:28:12] hitting the image on his feet. Praise
[1:28:15] the Lord.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; We talk about uh uh the the the the the
[1:28:22] giant that challenged the the the
[1:28:25] Israelite, the Jews, Goliath. When David
[1:28:28] got down there, he picked up five
[1:28:30] stones. Amen. And that five stones uh is
[1:28:34] is is being spelled out as Jesus s you
[1:28:38] know is being spelled out as f a t faith
[1:28:42] and all of that. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And now year also so a stone hit the the
[1:28:49] the challenging giant to the Jewish in
[1:28:52] in his face. Now a stone is hitting the
[1:28:56] challenging giants to the gentile in his
[1:28:59] feet. Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; The the the the the challenging Jewish
[1:29:05] giant was a physical one. Our giant is a
[1:29:09] spiritual one. Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; So the whole book of Daniel is all about
[1:29:14] spiritual warfare.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; It's about spiritual warfare. Praise the
[1:29:20] Lord.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. If you I mean if
[1:29:24] you just think that uh uh uh you know uh
[1:29:27] uh uh uh being a Christian is just to go
[1:29:30] to church and become you know uh belong
[1:29:32] to a church, put your name on the book
[1:29:34] and all of that. You you just don't know
[1:29:36] what you are talking about.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; You don't know what you are talking
[1:29:40] about because this is a this is a
[1:29:42] kingdom principle.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Okay, these are kingdoms that are at
[1:29:47] war.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of dark forces. is the
[1:29:52] kingdom of evil power is at war with the
[1:29:56] kingdom of light.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And there is no way you you can you you
[1:30:00] want to be identified with the kingdom
[1:30:02] of light
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; that you will not come under one one
[1:30:08] attack or another.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; So it's all about spiritual warfare. We
[1:30:16] will get into there. It's just an
[1:30:17] introduction here. But so we see here,
[1:30:20] let me read this now. thing of uh what
[1:30:22] thing of Christ and uh and then I
[1:30:25] beheld.
[1:30:27] Praise the Lord. And then I beheld till
[1:30:30] there was a stone caught out of the
[1:30:31] mountain with our hand and rolled into
[1:30:35] Babylon pour pulled down and it and it
[1:30:39] became a great mountain that fell all
[1:30:43] the earth. He said that was Jesus Christ
[1:30:49] the son of the living God. Hallelujah
[1:30:52] Daniel. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; So he was the stone like like David said
[1:31:00] h you you you you come against us as a
[1:31:05] mighty giant but Goliath I come against
[1:31:07] you in the name of the almighty God.
[1:31:10] Amen. Of the God of Israel. And that
[1:31:13] name was the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:15] Christ. Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the same thing
[1:31:18] that is playing out here. So we see here
[1:31:21] uh uh let let me take another one here
[1:31:23] from from the seven church ages. And the
[1:31:26] God of heaven cut a stone out of the
[1:31:29] mountain with our hand that stone this
[1:31:32] image uh uh uh in the feet and broke all
[1:31:37] the gentile kingdoms down. And the
[1:31:40] kingdom of Christ ruled and reigned and
[1:31:43] growled and covered the earth from sea
[1:31:47] to sea.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; So when the stone year hit the image,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; The image fell and there was the as the
[1:32:00] image is falling, there's a dust that
[1:32:02] rose up in the air as the image went
[1:32:05] down to the ground.
[1:32:07] But as the dust was uh was was fading
[1:32:10] away,
[1:32:13] there was a mountain.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it in here. Let's read
[1:32:17] it. I saw thou saw till the stone was
[1:32:22] cut out of the hand cut out without
[1:32:25] hand. Which stone the image upon his
[1:32:28] feet that were of iron and clay and
[1:32:30] break them into pieces? Then was the
[1:32:34] iron and clay and brides and silver. All
[1:32:37] of those uh uh component that made the
[1:32:39] image of the the the the gold, the
[1:32:41] brides, the silver, the iron, the clay,
[1:32:47] brass and savor
[1:32:50] and gold broken into pieces and became
[1:32:54] like a chaff of
[1:32:58] of the summer churching floor. and the
[1:33:01] wind carried them away and no place was
[1:33:04] formed for them. Praise the Lord. What
[1:33:07] is happening yet is that the political
[1:33:10] power now is being swept away
[1:33:14] and is going to turn to a religious
[1:33:16] power
[1:33:19] but we will get into that. Amen.
[1:33:21] So there was no place found for them and
[1:33:24] the stone
[1:33:26] that smiled the image became a great
[1:33:28] mountain
[1:33:30] which fill the whole earth. Praise the
[1:33:33] Lord.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; So this stone now became a great
[1:33:37] mountain.
[1:33:39] So it replaced the image.
[1:33:43] It cast down the image and it became a
[1:33:47] great mountain.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm I'm I'm fishing this
[1:33:55] morning, so all of this is just a bit on
[1:33:58] the hook.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next image.
[1:34:11] I think I froze this thing. It's okay.
[1:34:16] It works. Sometimes it don't work.
[1:34:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Okay, go to the next one. We covered
[1:34:31] this one already. So, this is the
[1:34:32] mountain that came.
[1:34:35] This is the mountain that was made off
[1:34:37] of the stone.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:45] When the stone hits the image in his
[1:34:48] feet, the Bible say out of the stone
[1:34:51] came a great mountain.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to realize now that all of
[1:35:00] these things ha
[1:35:04] interpreting uh Nebuchin as a dream, all
[1:35:07] of these things are spiritual.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are giving you we are we are
[1:35:14] putting image to it so so it can it can
[1:35:17] it can become vision to you. Praise the
[1:35:20] Lord.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; So this is the mountain
[1:35:24] that came out of the image.
[1:35:28] Are we together?
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; There's something I saw in uh uh Isaiah
[1:35:38] Isaiah chapter 2. That's that's what is
[1:35:40] written right down here. Let's let's
[1:35:42] let's go there. That's Isaiah chapter 2.
[1:35:44] You don't have to go. That's that's is
[1:35:46] this these are just Bible verses right
[1:35:48] here. Isaiah chapter 2, I think, reading
[1:35:50] from verse two. If you read there, and
[1:35:52] it shall come to pass in the last day
[1:35:57] that the mountain of the Lord's house.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; So you see this mountain
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; was also going to be a house of God.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:09] That is the reason why we use this
[1:36:12] because pretty soon in another image
[1:36:15] we're going to bring the church ages in.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] So Isaiah is saying here, it will come
[1:36:30] to pass in the last day that the
[1:36:32] mountain of the Lord's house shall be
[1:36:35] established in the top of the mountain.
[1:36:39] I've never seen this before until
[1:36:41] recently
[1:36:43] that how the parame fit this
[1:36:46] interpretation of the scripture.
[1:36:50] Let me read that again to you and then
[1:36:52] uh and so you can look at it and see it.
[1:36:56] Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; The mountain of the Lord's house, this
[1:37:00] is the mountain of the Lord's house,
[1:37:04] shall be
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; established in the top of the mountain.
[1:37:10] So this is a mountain.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And this is a mountain.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see it?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:27] The mountain of the Lord house shall be
[1:37:29] established in the top of the mountain.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And shall be exalted above the hills,
[1:37:42] and all nation shall flow unto it. And
[1:37:45] many people shall go and say, "Come
[1:37:47] here, and let us go up to the mountain
[1:37:49] of the Lord, to the house of God of
[1:37:52] Jacob."
[1:37:53] and uh he shall teach us
[1:37:58] of his ways and and and we will walk in
[1:38:01] his path out of Zion shall go for the
[1:38:03] Lord and the word of the Lord and the
[1:38:06] word of the Lord from Jerusalem. Praise
[1:38:09] the Lord.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Like I said, I will come back to this. I
[1:38:12] I will I I will dwell on it and and
[1:38:14] there there are things that I want to
[1:38:15] bring to you from there because you you
[1:38:17] will see where you will see where all
[1:38:21] nation shall flow onto it. Amen. you see
[1:38:26] where all nations shall flow unto him
[1:38:28] because that is the work that is done in
[1:38:30] the gentile church
[1:38:33] when God says I will get a people out of
[1:38:36] the nations for my name's sake
[1:38:41] and it will have to do with a seven
[1:38:43] church ages
[1:38:45] praise the Lord
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:38:49] so I'm I'm not worried about that now
[1:38:51] I'm going to come back to
[1:38:55] And uh uh well I let me leave this.
[1:38:58] Okay. So I I I kind of for just bring it
[1:39:01] down yet a little bit. So just to be
[1:39:03] able to give you more picture about it
[1:39:06] is is uh uh so the the the the mountains
[1:39:10] of the Lord.
[1:39:13] Amen. In the Lord's house. So we see
[1:39:17] that uh uh uh that's the reason why we
[1:39:21] using the paramil because because uh uh
[1:39:26] we know that uh uh there there are three
[1:39:30] uh uh uh historical Bible you know uh uh
[1:39:34] theologians will will will will tell us
[1:39:37] that you know that God first wrote his
[1:39:39] word in the heavens. Brother Brandham
[1:39:41] said that you know the heaven was God's
[1:39:43] first Bible. That's why Paul can say
[1:39:46] even nature itself should teach you.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Nature itself should teach you because
[1:39:51] the heavens is God first Bible.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; And the and the second one was the one
[1:39:56] that Enoch built.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Now we don't we don't read the par. You
[1:40:02] don't need to read the heavens because
[1:40:04] you have the word of God.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to start learning
[1:40:10] to be a stargazer
[1:40:12] when you have God's word here.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And that is the same thing. We we are
[1:40:20] not uh uh uh uh uh parame worshippers
[1:40:25] because uh over over the years the the
[1:40:29] the the signs of the zodiac has changed.
[1:40:32] The Babylonians change it and uh uh the
[1:40:36] Chinese get their zodiac. The Indians
[1:40:38] get their zodiac. So which zodiac will
[1:40:40] we believe?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come back to the word
[1:40:44] of God.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Let's come back to the word of God. So
[1:40:51] So here we see here now the the
[1:40:54] mountains of the Lord. The reason why
[1:40:56] I'm saying that because every every
[1:40:59] stage in the growth of the church was a
[1:41:03] mountain.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; That's what I said. I will explain that
[1:41:07] to you better. Every time the church was
[1:41:09] growing, we realized here that uh the
[1:41:12] first messenger to the Ephesus church
[1:41:15] age was Paul.
[1:41:17] Amen. He met the pillar of fire on the
[1:41:20] road of Damascus. He was the first
[1:41:23] messenger to the church age. Paul was
[1:41:26] the one that wrote most of the New
[1:41:28] Testament.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Paul wrote most of the New
[1:41:33] Testament. One of one of the exciting
[1:41:36] things that you will see there is that
[1:41:38] Paul sent a letter to seven churches.
[1:41:40] Sorry.
[1:41:42] He sent a letter to seven churches.
[1:41:46] He wrote 13 letters.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Does that Does that Can you put the
[1:41:52] mouth together?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; He wrote 13 letters.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; But he sent a message to seven churches.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; What are you seeing? 13 is the number of
[1:42:06] a woman.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; So if you you count all of Paul letters,
[1:42:11] they are 13.
[1:42:13] But out of those letters, he wrote to
[1:42:15] seven churches because the letter of
[1:42:17] Filimon was not to a church. It was it
[1:42:20] was to Filimon. Amen. The the letter of
[1:42:22] the Hebrew, it was not it was to the
[1:42:24] Jewish believers. But these were the
[1:42:26] seven churches that Paul sent his letter
[1:42:30] to. Therefore, Paul wrote the biggest
[1:42:34] part of the New Testament. God had God
[1:42:38] had him to do that because uh it's is
[1:42:41] coming a gentile age. So we know that
[1:42:45] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, they just
[1:42:48] wrote a record of what they witness.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; They wrote they wrote an eyewitness
[1:42:55] report. But when it when it comes to to
[1:42:58] the the the the the what we call the New
[1:43:01] Testament, Paul wrote it.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Praise the Lord. Paul
[1:43:07] wrote the New Testament. So, yeah,
[1:43:09] that's that's why we have him here uh h
[1:43:12] as as the as the as the foundation stone
[1:43:16] and and uh and Paul Paul was uh uh uh a
[1:43:21] prophet and and an apostle to the
[1:43:24] Gentiles. Praise the Lord. And then we
[1:43:26] come through the seven church ages, but
[1:43:28] we will get to that. Amen.
[1:43:31] So what's happening here now is that we
[1:43:34] see
[1:43:36] yes the church here the mountain that
[1:43:40] came up after the image went down is the
[1:43:44] church
[1:43:45] the mountain that came up because in in
[1:43:49] Nebuchadnezzar uh h dream God was
[1:43:53] speaking about gentile kingdom.
[1:43:56] Amen. the Babylonian, the Mes and
[1:43:58] Persian, the Greeks and the Romans, they
[1:44:01] are all gentile kingdom. But after the
[1:44:04] Gentile kingdom, he was going to get a
[1:44:06] people out of the Gentile for his name's
[1:44:08] sake.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; And that people will be now the church.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; So now in this church because th this
[1:44:22] now is going to is going to set foot for
[1:44:25] what what I want to go in this morning.
[1:44:27] So we can go back to our subject. I was
[1:44:29] just I was just trying to to to get you
[1:44:32] wet in the water a little bit. So right
[1:44:35] here uh uh uh uh the mountain that has
[1:44:39] come out after the drop of the image now
[1:44:42] we see here now is the church.
[1:44:45] But what is happening here in this
[1:44:47] picture that you are looking at with
[1:44:49] many of you that that have an idea about
[1:44:51] it is this is uh Revelation chapter 6.
[1:44:54] this right here in Revelation chapter 6.
[1:44:57] Uh the first few verses in Revelation
[1:44:59] chapter 6 and and and and uh and I saw
[1:45:04] when the lamb opened one of the seal and
[1:45:07] I heard it was were a noise of thunder
[1:45:10] one of the four beasts saying one of
[1:45:13] these four beasts.
[1:45:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; That is the lion, the ox, the man, and
[1:45:20] the eagle. one of these saying,
[1:45:24] "Praise the Lord, come and see." And I
[1:45:27] saw and beheld a white horse. This is
[1:45:30] the one now. So right here
[1:45:34] represent the demon power that is
[1:45:37] coming. You have to remember now Jesus
[1:45:39] says, "I will build my church, but the
[1:45:42] gates of hell will not prevail against
[1:45:44] it."
[1:45:45] He didn't say the gates of hell will not
[1:45:47] come against it, but he say it will not
[1:45:49] prevail against it.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; So right here we have a h a stream of
[1:45:56] demon power that is coming against the
[1:45:58] church in every ages. Right? Our Lord
[1:46:01] Jesus Christ was persecuted. He was
[1:46:04] crucified. John the Baptist hair was cut
[1:46:06] off for this very same gospel that we
[1:46:08] were that we are preaching. Peter and
[1:46:10] John was put into prison. So there is a
[1:46:13] power that is always fighting against
[1:46:15] the church.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; But yet we want to be on flowering bags
[1:46:22] of
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; eat.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; We just want it easy. We want an easy
[1:46:31] ride to heaven.
[1:46:33] The ride to heaven is easy when you are
[1:46:35] believing. When you are believing
[1:46:37] everything God is doing in your life,
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; you are believing everything that God is
[1:46:41] doing, knowing that he's bringing you to
[1:46:44] a better person.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; He's bringing you to a better person.
[1:46:50] Jeremiah, wake on your brother. I don't
[1:46:52] know if he's meditating or he's
[1:46:53] sleeping.
[1:46:56] Now, so we see here I saw in the white
[1:47:00] hearse and he that that went for to uh
[1:47:03] went for conquering and to conquer and
[1:47:05] when he had opened the second the the
[1:47:08] second seal, I heard the second beast.
[1:47:11] And the second beast was an ox. We will
[1:47:13] get all into death. Now uh uh the second
[1:47:18] beast uh
[1:47:20] said, "Come and see." And there went for
[1:47:24] a red there. This is this is the red
[1:47:26] hearse here. The first one was a white.
[1:47:28] The second one is a red. Are we
[1:47:30] together?
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; A red heart. And power was given to him
[1:47:40] that sat upon to take peace from the
[1:47:43] earth. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. To take peace from the earth.
[1:47:50] the the the emerging of uh you remember
[1:47:53] the last time we talked on building in
[1:47:55] troublesome time I was bringing you the
[1:47:57] three wolves
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; we will get into that. Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; I I I like I said uh Fe just threw me in
[1:48:04] the water so I just have to swim.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; So he said come yet and power was given
[1:48:10] to take peace from the earth and uh and
[1:48:13] that they should kill one another. And
[1:48:16] there was given unto him a great
[1:48:18] swallow. And when he had opened the
[1:48:20] tears seal, I heard the tear beast,
[1:48:22] which is a man, the anointing of a man,
[1:48:26] saying, "Come and see. And I behold and
[1:48:29] look uh I saw a black horse." Amen.
[1:48:34] And uh uh and he that sat on it had a
[1:48:38] pair of balance in his hands.
[1:48:41] Amen.
[1:48:44] And I heard a voice in the midst of the
[1:48:47] full be saying a measure of wheat
[1:48:52] for a penny. Three measure of ballet for
[1:48:55] a penny. Right here that's when
[1:48:57] purgatory and uh uh uh even back those
[1:49:01] days uh uh uh uh in the early church you
[1:49:05] have to pay for your seat that you sit
[1:49:07] on.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:49:09] the the the the rich people they just
[1:49:12] they just say we want to sit in this row
[1:49:14] you know they pay for it whether they
[1:49:16] are in church or not you don't sit in
[1:49:18] their seat
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; you read church history you find it out
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:49:27] there was a man uh uh that that that
[1:49:30] rebuked that out of the church raised up
[1:49:33] a man that rebuked that out of the
[1:49:34] church
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:49:38] Amen. That's I mean that's the reason
[1:49:40] why I mean we should not have no special
[1:49:42] city in the house of God.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; And uh so yeah the Bible says and I
[1:49:47] heard a voice of a measure for the and
[1:49:50] see you heard not the oil and wine one.
[1:49:52] When he had opened the fourth seal, I
[1:49:55] heard the fourth beast which is which is
[1:49:56] the eagle saying come and see. And I
[1:50:00] look and then I saw uh pill
[1:50:04] and his name that sle him was called
[1:50:08] death. And you read down and down and
[1:50:10] down. So what is happening here is that
[1:50:13] that the reason why I I I I brought us
[1:50:16] out of this way is to bring us to where
[1:50:18] we are because right here is a gathering
[1:50:21] of powers.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; So you have to realize that all of these
[1:50:27] came through the seven church ages from
[1:50:29] the time of the book of acts to our time
[1:50:32] that we are living in. All of this came
[1:50:34] through the seven church ages.
[1:50:37] At the time that God had the lion
[1:50:40] anointing, the first three church ages
[1:50:42] was under the lion anointing. We will
[1:50:44] get there. That that's that's when the
[1:50:46] gospel was going around the world. This
[1:50:49] man uh I mean they were risking their
[1:50:51] life. Just just remember the man like uh
[1:50:54] we call him doubting Thomas. But when
[1:50:57] Thomas got the revelation that Jesus
[1:51:00] Christ has resurrected, he was not
[1:51:02] afraid to take the gospel across the sea
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; into India.
[1:51:13] So they were all on this. And while they
[1:51:16] were on this, there was an evil
[1:51:18] anointing that was also fighting against
[1:51:20] the church.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:30] Are we together?
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; There's an evil power here that was
[1:51:33] fighting against the church and then and
[1:51:35] then uh and then we so on and so forth.
[1:51:37] So we see here there's a gathering of
[1:51:39] powers. I'll come back to all of this.
[1:51:41] Like I said uh uh another time. So we
[1:51:44] see that the red, the white, the red,
[1:51:47] the black hers combined
[1:51:50] to a deadly pill house. All of these
[1:51:53] power come to our age.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; They have combound and it has become a
[1:52:01] pill. And what is happening is that uh
[1:52:04] what it will produce when those power
[1:52:06] comes together it produce Satan
[1:52:10] incarnate
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; in a person
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; or a people.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; That's where playing God comes on the
[1:52:20] scene.
[1:52:22] Because that's what we read in
[1:52:24] Thessalonians.
[1:52:25] He will sit he will exalt himself
[1:52:30] to be God to be as God.
[1:52:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; That's where playing God, our subject of
[1:52:39] playing God comes on the scene. But why
[1:52:42] these powers the reason why they are
[1:52:45] coming together is also right here also
[1:52:49] God is pouring this power into this
[1:52:52] power and into this power and yet they
[1:52:54] are all coming together the lion the ox
[1:52:57] and the man's anointing all join under
[1:52:59] the eagle anointing and what is it
[1:53:02] producing is going to also produce
[1:53:04] Christ incarnate
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; is going to produce a son of man
[1:53:09] ministry
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; in a person
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; a bride
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; in a people.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; So it's a gathering of powers.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; We are in a time where there are
[1:53:28] gathering of powers. Few few days ago
[1:53:31] some maybe early this week or last week
[1:53:34] we saw Russia, China, North Korea
[1:53:36] gathering their power, showing their
[1:53:38] military might. They are saying we don't
[1:53:41] we don't care for America and the West.
[1:53:43] They can't do nothing to us.
[1:53:46] All of those three leaders gathered
[1:53:48] there in China and they had a parade
[1:53:50] better than what we had in the US.
[1:53:55] The Chinese brought all of their war
[1:53:58] power and uh and and and Russian
[1:54:00] president is there, North Korea
[1:54:02] president is there and the Chinese
[1:54:04] president is parading. What are they
[1:54:06] doing? They are gathering their powers.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Y
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; What is the word council or churches
[1:54:15] doing? Gathering her powers.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to be doing?
[1:54:25] Gathering our powers.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Gathering uniting time and shine. We're
[1:54:34] supposed to be uniting with the word.
[1:54:36] Amen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be getting close to
[1:54:38] God
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; to get stronger in our faith.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; So that is the thing that is bringing us
[1:54:53] to where we are this morning. Gathering
[1:54:54] of powers.
[1:54:58] So with that with that being said,
[1:55:02] praise the Lord.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:06] Okay. Gathering of powers. And as so we
[1:55:09] we we we see here as as I as I get into
[1:55:13] my subject and and and try to uh let you
[1:55:15] get out of here quickly, friends. Settle
[1:55:18] down. Settle down yourself. Settle down
[1:55:20] yourself.
[1:55:22] That's why Paul was telling these people
[1:55:24] in the book of Thessalonian. We read,
[1:55:26] "Settle down yourself. The hour has
[1:55:28] come. There has been a lot of playing
[1:55:31] religion.
[1:55:34] There's been a lot of playing church.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Are we guilty of it? Yes, we are.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; A lot of playing church.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; And when people play religion, you play
[1:55:49] church. The next thing you will play is
[1:55:50] God.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; That's the next thing you will play.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; You will become the God of your life.
[1:55:57] You don't believe nobody. You believe
[1:55:59] only yourself.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Is that not the slogan of the time?
[1:56:02] believe yourself.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; You won't believe nobody. You don't have
[1:56:10] an absolute. You just believe yourself.
[1:56:13] Which mean you have you you are playing
[1:56:15] God. You have become God to yourself.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; You worship yourself.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; You don't care what the Bible says. You
[1:56:27] don't care what I mean whether there is
[1:56:29] a God. You know, everybody trying I
[1:56:31] don't care about a god. You know, the
[1:56:33] the atheists, they are nostics. That's
[1:56:34] what he say. They just believe in
[1:56:36] themselves.
[1:56:43] There's a lot of playing church. But the
[1:56:45] hour has come where God is calling a
[1:56:48] people out.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Calling the people out of what? Playing
[1:56:52] church. Playing religion.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Because the danger of that is that you
[1:56:58] will play God.
[1:57:00] Whether you like it or not, you will
[1:57:02] play God.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; And when you start playing God in your
[1:57:09] own life is an antichrist spirit.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; You are possessed with a rebellious
[1:57:16] spirit.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:28] We are we are not living in the days of
[1:57:30] playing church. We are living in the
[1:57:33] days when Jesus Christ is making himself
[1:57:36] manifest to his church.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; To prove through his word that he might
[1:57:43] be fulfilled. These things that I do,
[1:57:46] you shall do always.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; It is not just drama.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; but that's what the church wants now. We
[1:57:54] just want an entertainer,
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; someone that just come and make us laugh
[1:57:58] and you know and just and just we just
[1:58:01] laugh laugh our heart out.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; And and and is is this uh is this uh uh
[1:58:14] uh uh uh making himself manifest to the
[1:58:16] church, proving his word? That is the
[1:58:19] challenge for the age because the age
[1:58:21] don't want the word of God.
[1:58:24] No, they don't want the word of God.
[1:58:26] They don't want instruction from God's
[1:58:27] word.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; They want to follow their heart,
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; follow their mind. When this very word
[1:58:34] of God tells you your heart is
[1:58:37] desperately wicked,
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; it
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; the Bible say desperately wicked.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; But the real word, the the true word for
[1:58:46] that is that your heart is incurable.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; It cannot be killed. That's the reason
[1:58:52] why God always says get a new heart. I
[1:58:55] gave you a new heart
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; because it can be killed. You cannot you
[1:58:59] cannot uh you cannot kill the pro the
[1:59:02] corruption that is with that came with
[1:59:04] our first birth that is in this heart
[1:59:06] full of jealousy, full of anger, full of
[1:59:10] rage.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; And to our own destruction.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; It's to our own destruction. That is the
[1:59:23] time that we are living in.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; That is the time that we are living.
[1:59:29] Thank you young people. You can take
[1:59:30] this. Let's let's keep this for another
[1:59:32] time when we get there. Just give me
[1:59:34] Genesis chapter 3:5. Let's let's go
[1:59:37] quickly here. So I just I'm doing all of
[1:59:40] this just to bring you to where what I
[1:59:42] want to share with you this morning.
[1:59:45] I know I took more more time in my in my
[1:59:47] introduction than what I want to say
[1:59:49] this morning. But if you read Genesis
[1:59:51] chapter 3 verse 5, you you you see their
[1:59:55] temptation of the devil there with Eve.
[1:59:58] See what he says. He says, "For God does
[2:00:01] know that the day you eat thereof, then
[2:00:04] your eyes shall be open and ye shall be
[2:00:09] as
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:00:14] He robbed them
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; of the divine image.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; He robbed them of the deity that they
[2:00:21] were.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Instead of you being God, you can be as
[2:00:27] God.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; You just playing God.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Instead of you to to speak creation,
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; you can wish that I can speak creation.
[2:00:39] Yeah.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; You you you you enjoy living in the
[2:00:45] fantasy.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; I just hope I can speak myself out of
[2:00:48] here.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; You should not hope. You should be doing
[2:00:51] it.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; You should be doing it because Jesus
[2:00:56] said you said to this mountain be they
[2:00:58] removed and they were you should be
[2:01:00] doing it.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Not that you should hope that you can do
[2:01:02] it.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:09] Are we together? But what he did, he
[2:01:11] robbed them. He robbed them of that
[2:01:13] divine image.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; He robbed of them. That's the reason why
[2:01:19] Paul will says over in uh uh uh uh
[2:01:22] Philippian chapter 2. We we we we we
[2:01:26] went a little bit there on Wednesday
[2:01:27] night. Philippians chapter 2, let this
[2:01:30] mind be in you.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you.
[2:01:37] Philippians chapter 2 verse 5.
[2:01:41] Let's just read that a little bit. I
[2:01:43] know there's there's a place that I
[2:01:44] wanted to comment on a little bit here.
[2:01:48] Let this mind be in you.
[2:01:54] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; 25. I'm right down here.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] Amen. Let this mind be in you which was
[2:02:08] also in Christ. Who being in the form of
[2:02:12] God.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Being in the form of God.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; What was the form? The form was not his
[2:02:22] physical body.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; The form was not his physical body. The
[2:02:28] form was a theophonic body that was
[2:02:30] dwelling in his physical body. Amen.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; He was in the form of God.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Being in the form of God
[2:02:46] who being in the form of God, he taught
[2:02:48] it not robbery to be equal with God.
[2:02:52] That it was not robbery
[2:02:54] that he could says I am the father. I
[2:02:56] won. Jesus never second thought that
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; that I came from God. I go back to God.
[2:03:03] It was not a second thought for him.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; He never taught a robbery to be equal
[2:03:08] with God.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; But he made himself of no repetition and
[2:03:16] took upon him the form of a servant and
[2:03:19] was made in the image of a man. And
[2:03:22] being formed in faction of a man, he
[2:03:26] humbled himself and became obedience
[2:03:29] unto death, even the death of the cross.
[2:03:34] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; So we see uh that was the mystery of his
[2:03:38] being being God. But yet he could humble
[2:03:41] himself.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; But when men are playing God, what they
[2:03:48] do? They exalt themselves.
[2:03:53] Hallelujah.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; When you are playing God, there is there
[2:03:56] is no divine power to control you.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; You can be nice for a woman and the next
[2:04:03] thing you tell the person, if it is not
[2:04:05] for me, you will not live.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; You can just be nice for the woman.
[2:04:12] There is no divine power to be able to
[2:04:14] control you.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; You can just behave.
[2:04:20] But pretty soon you come on your throne
[2:04:24] and you exercise your power.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; I make you who you are.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Are are we together?
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh uh uh that's not just
[2:04:47] the mysteries there. is is being being
[2:04:49] able to balance the two where you have
[2:04:53] here the uh h a man in the form of God.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; He's he can say peace be still.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; He never went to a funeral
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; because when he show up the dead body
[2:05:07] comes back to life.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; They call him to Jarus daughter house
[2:05:13] the people are crying. He get back there
[2:05:15] he say you get outside.
[2:05:18] Why you weep? Because she's sleeping. I
[2:05:20] go to wake her up.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Why? He was in the form of God. But yet
[2:05:25] there was a divine power that could
[2:05:28] humble him.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; That even his creatures could mistreat
[2:05:33] him and he would not say a word.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:44] [Music]
[2:05:47] the one that had the power
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; over nature.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; But yet there was there was there was
[2:05:55] such a divine power in him.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a guess work.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; It's not a guesswork.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Paul dealt with this. You see there over
[2:06:11] in Romans chapter one, what did he says?
[2:06:14] He says what? The the the law of the
[2:06:17] creature. Let's let's read there. Romans
[2:06:20] chapter 1 verse 25.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Verse 24, he says uh uh uh
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; 23 and changed the glory of the
[2:06:44] incorruptible God into the image made
[2:06:46] like unto corruptible men. They have
[2:06:50] changed the glory of God.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; We have make God our errant boy.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; The glory of God we have just reduced it
[2:07:00] to material things.
[2:07:03] perishable things.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; How can we bring the internal value of
[2:07:08] God to perishable things
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; is when we have this then we say God
[2:07:12] blessing us. When we have this and and
[2:07:14] and that where the the really glory of
[2:07:17] where he want to change our lives,
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; change our lives
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; where he can make your life as a
[2:07:26] billboard for dying people on the
[2:07:28] street. where he can make you as a
[2:07:30] servant to be able to uh serve someone
[2:07:33] else.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; That that is his glory.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; We have just reduced it into uh you know
[2:07:42] what we wear, what we eat and uh uh what
[2:07:44] we drive, where we live.
[2:07:49] That's where the age has reduced the
[2:07:51] glory of God to
[2:07:55] changing the incorruptible glory to an
[2:07:58] image of corruptible men, birds, and
[2:08:00] four feet of beast, creeping things.
[2:08:02] Wherefore God also gave them up to
[2:08:04] unclean cleanness through the loss of
[2:08:06] their their heart to dishonor their
[2:08:09] bodies between himself who changed the
[2:08:12] truth of God to a lie. They worship and
[2:08:16] serve the creature
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; more than the creator.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; We will break God's word just to be able
[2:08:26] to keep a job.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; The job has become a god to us.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; We can I I I I you know I I don't want
[2:08:38] to lose this job.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. or were you eating
[2:08:43] before they formed that company
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; that we would tell lies and and then I
[2:08:52] mean uh we will cheat and lie just
[2:08:54] because we want to keep a certain image.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; We worship and serve the creature more
[2:09:05] than the creator
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; who is blessed forever.
[2:09:09] God has has has become nothing to us in
[2:09:12] this generation
[2:09:14] because what we have become gods. We are
[2:09:17] playing God.
[2:09:20] We are playing God. We will go through
[2:09:23] uh h trouble go through trial. Let
[2:09:27] people give testimony.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; The only time God is mentioned is praise
[2:09:34] God. Praise God
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; church. Praise the Lord. Oh, that only
[2:09:40] thank God. Now they about now to to talk
[2:09:43] about themsel.
[2:09:45] How I how I hustle. How you know I was
[2:09:48] there. How I was there.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; On our billboards. God is in the corner.
[2:09:58] It's all about us
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; and our achievement.
[2:10:11] We worship and serve
[2:10:16] the creatures.
[2:10:19] Are we together?
[2:10:21] We worship and serve the creatures.
[2:10:24] Paul in in in in 2 Corinthians chapter
[2:10:27] chapter 3 verse two he says they will be
[2:10:30] lover of themsel more than the lover of
[2:10:33] God.
[2:10:34] They will be lover of themsel. That's
[2:10:37] the age that we are living in. Perilous
[2:10:40] time. Men will be lover of themsel
[2:10:44] more than the lover of God.
[2:10:48] Praise the Lord.
[2:10:51] No wonder why the church in in in in in
[2:10:54] in holl
[2:10:58] they they they had to fight will
[2:11:01] worship.
[2:11:04] It's all about that self worshiping.
[2:11:08] All about that self worshiping.
[2:11:11] We must be praised. Our name must be
[2:11:14] mentioned.
[2:11:16] I did this and they didn't even call my
[2:11:18] name.
[2:11:22] When in the time of all people were
[2:11:24] doing h men and women of God were doing
[2:11:27] things in in silence because they knew
[2:11:29] Jesus said let now your left hand see
[2:11:31] why your right hand
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; does.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; They were doing things God laid it on my
[2:11:37] heart to do. Jesus said tell no man.
[2:11:41] He didn't say go and tell them I don't
[2:11:43] want open your eyes. He said tell no
[2:11:45] man.
[2:11:52] But when our name is not mentioned, we
[2:11:55] take offense.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:12:07] your body is the temple
[2:12:11] of God.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Now what did the B what did what what
[2:12:14] what did this man of sin what did Paul
[2:12:16] told us here? He will sit in the temple
[2:12:18] as God.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Your body is the temple of God. God must
[2:12:24] be sitting there. Not you.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Not you sitting there.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; God must be sitting there.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the Lord is in his holy
[2:12:35] temple.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Let the earth keep silent.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Let all our fleshly desire keep silent.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Let all our fleshly ambition keep
[2:12:45] silent.
[2:12:46] Let the temple magnify God. Let men see
[2:12:50] his good work.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Let him see your good work and glorify
[2:12:54] God.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; But we have our own personality sitting
[2:13:02] in this temple
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; that is hard to see God.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; It's hard to see God. It's just all
[2:13:09] about you.
[2:13:17] It's hard to see God.
[2:13:20] Your veil have not been rented yet.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what the baptisming of the
[2:13:26] Holy Ghost will do.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; I tell you this morning, if you don't
[2:13:29] have the Holy Ghost,
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; you will end up in self worship. You
[2:13:33] can't help it.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; You can't help it.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; You will try your best. You will try the
[2:13:44] best and best and best that you can do.
[2:13:46] You will end up being frustrated because
[2:13:48] it's all about self-gratification.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; We don't love the worship because we did
[2:13:57] not enjoy it.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Are you the one we worshiping?
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Are you the one we are worshiping?
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; We are worshiping God.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:13] That's the age that we are living in.
[2:14:16] That is the thing that is killing our
[2:14:18] age.
[2:14:23] But as as as as Bible believers, we have
[2:14:25] to see it. The Bible speaks there a day
[2:14:30] where uh he that is filthy will remain
[2:14:33] filthy.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; It's an age where uh uh the the spirit
[2:14:36] of God is lifting up
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; off the earth.
[2:14:40] Just like in the days of Noah when the
[2:14:42] Bible said God said my spirit will no
[2:14:44] longer strive with men.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Because his imagination has become evil.
[2:14:49] The people were just consumed about
[2:14:51] themsel and their desire.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; It's what they want to do.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Whether it is against God or not, they
[2:14:58] just want to do it.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Whether it's going to affect their
[2:15:02] health or not, they don't care. They
[2:15:04] just want just self gratification. They
[2:15:08] are sitting on the throne of their own
[2:15:11] heart.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; They worship themselves and they want
[2:15:15] other people to worship them.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Can you see what we're talking about?
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery of iniquity. What is
[2:15:40] iniquity
[2:15:42] as we've been taught? Knowing what is
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; right and failing to do it.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Knowing what is right and failing to do
[2:15:53] it. When you when you read there the
[2:15:55] Bible call that the the mystery of
[2:15:57] iniquity, it call it the mystery of
[2:15:59] lawlessness.
[2:16:02] What has brought men to this place?
[2:16:05] Every day there has to be some kind of a
[2:16:07] evil in the news.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Men have just be they are they are just
[2:16:14] becoming so tested for their own blood.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; It has to be a bloodshed. It has to be
[2:16:19] death. It has to be h rape. Kidnap.
[2:16:31] Can't you see that Satan is the god of
[2:16:33] this evil age?
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; And he's gathering his people.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he want to incarnate them.
[2:16:43] He want to sit on the throne of their
[2:16:45] heart.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; People just so caught up in their own
[2:16:53] mind and they bring bunch of Bible verse
[2:16:55] around it. When you know that the thing
[2:16:57] you're doing is not ain't making you
[2:16:59] happy.
[2:17:01] Then yeah, you look for Bible verse to
[2:17:03] to to to satisfy yourself
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; to find a reason why you must stay that
[2:17:09] way.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus took up his his robe and and and
[2:17:20] and and and and towered himself and
[2:17:23] washed the disciples feet. He said, "I'm
[2:17:25] your Lord and Master. I did this unto do
[2:17:27] a one." He never said, "Wash your own
[2:17:29] feet.
[2:17:32] He said wash one another feet. Who feet
[2:17:35] are you watching?
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; That is the most lowest part of the
[2:17:42] body. Whose feet are you watching?
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Playing God. We play God even in our own
[2:17:59] lives.
[2:18:01] Praise the Lord. It has to be our way of
[2:18:04] or or the highway.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; When you don't even have control over
[2:18:10] your own birth
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; to even wake yourself up in the morning.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; The God that we are playing is the God
[2:18:20] of death. It's not the God of life.
[2:18:24] You are playing the god of death because
[2:18:26] you are only killing yourself.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; You are adding more sorrow to your
[2:18:30] sorrow.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; I will I will serve God the way I want
[2:18:37] to. Who told you say the way you want
[2:18:39] to? That the way to serve God. You're
[2:18:40] serving yourself

[2:19:42] the place and say, "Lord, not my will."
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Not my will, but let your will be done.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We only remember that when we are

[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Now when we say God now my will when you
[2:19:55] feel causing the problem
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; you feeling being disrespectful and
[2:19:59] disobedient to God's word and you say
[2:20:02] now my will let your will be done. When
[2:20:03] you really know that you want your will
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; musicians you can come
[2:20:17] We continue on Wednesday night
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; if the Lord want us to.

[2:21:20] You go.
[2:21:23] Oh, God. Roll me.
[2:21:27] Steep and rough.
[2:21:30] when he needs me

[2:21:37] I want God's way
[2:21:40] to be my way
[2:21:43] every day.
[2:21:49] Oh, I want God's way
[2:21:54] to be my friend
[2:21:57] as I draw in the air.
[2:22:01] below.
[2:22:03] For there is no
[2:22:06] other highway
[2:22:10] that a child of God should go
[2:22:16] to the road
[2:22:20] and run
[2:22:22] [Music]
[2:22:24] me.
[2:22:26] is enough.
[2:22:29] I want God's way
[2:22:32] to be my way
[2:22:36] everywhere.
[2:22:40] Let's bow our heads. Sister Zoe, if you
[2:22:42] want to go and get yourself right back
[2:22:44] there.
[2:22:55] For there is no
[2:22:58] other
[2:22:59] highway
[2:23:01] that a child of God
[2:23:05] should go.
[2:23:08] Oh, the road is steeping.
[2:23:14] If he leads me,
[2:23:18] yes, he does.
[2:23:20] Oh, I want God's will.
[2:23:24] Do my way.
[2:23:31] Heavenly Father,
[2:23:34] Lord Jesus, this afternoon we sat
[2:23:36] honoring your word,
[2:23:39] talking about the man of sin, the son of
[2:23:42] pedition.
[2:23:43] We know that God that time is coming
[2:23:46] Lord Father where all of this evil power
[2:23:50] Lord God is going to dwell in one man
[2:23:54] precious Lord Jesus.
[2:23:57] Father, Lord God, but we we living in
[2:24:00] such a time, oh Lord God, where that
[2:24:01] spirit is already among us, Lord, a
[2:24:05] spirit of lawlessness.
[2:24:07] [Music]
[2:24:12] We don't even respect Lord Father
[2:24:16] the womb that we came out of. The Bible
[2:24:18] said children will be disobedient to
[2:24:20] parents.
[2:24:21] [Music]
[2:24:27] such an age of entitlement.
[2:24:30] [Music]
[2:24:32] The Bible say he exalted himself.
[2:24:36] He imposed himself
[2:24:39] and exalt himself.
[2:24:41] [Music]
[2:24:48] Father, how much are we humbling oursel?
[2:24:51] How much are we submitting ourself one
[2:24:53] onto another?
[2:24:58] When Moses said in the Bible, you will
[2:25:00] be the head and not the tail, he really
[2:25:03] never mean an opposing spirit.
[2:25:06] It's in leadership.
[2:25:09] The way we think about being the head is
[2:25:12] in leadership. And we you you you leave
[2:25:14] out an example.
[2:25:17] It's not you just sitting there and
[2:25:19] wanting people to do everything. That
[2:25:20] don't make you the head. You are the
[2:25:23] tail because they are doing everything
[2:25:24] for you.
[2:25:28] Be the head. The head leads the body.
[2:25:32] It's in our leadership. We want to be
[2:25:35] the head. We want to lead right. We want
[2:25:37] to lead our children right. We want to
[2:25:39] lead our home right. We want to lead our
[2:25:42] family right. That's what the prophet
[2:25:44] Moses was talking about.
[2:25:52] Father, you took on flesh upon us, Lord.
[2:25:55] You know what it You know what it is,
[2:25:57] Lord. You know what it is, Lord Jesus.
[2:26:01] When that person sang the song, one day
[2:26:04] at a time, they said, "Do you remember
[2:26:07] when you were here on earth, Lord,
[2:26:10] how wicked it was, oh God?
[2:26:16] Father, Lord Jesus, and that is the time
[2:26:19] that we are living in. Oh God, we see it
[2:26:21] right. We see it in the political reign.
[2:26:23] Oh God, the political centers, Lord,
[2:26:26] Father, we see it, oh God, precious Lord
[2:26:28] God, in the corporate center, Lord,
[2:26:31] managers, they want you to worship them,
[2:26:33] oh Father, the spirit of of servitude is
[2:26:37] gone away from our society. The spirit
[2:26:40] of servitude where people will find an
[2:26:43] opportunity to self is gone away.
[2:26:57] We have just become our own God.
[2:27:01] We are sitting on our throne.
[2:27:04] We are sitting on our throne. We will
[2:27:06] not bend. We will not break to God's
[2:27:08] word. we is going to be the way we see
[2:27:11] it. Even if the Bible don't speak
[2:27:13] against it, even if the word of God
[2:27:15] don't support it, we have we have
[2:27:17] crowned ourself on our throne
[2:27:20] and yet we think we are worshiping God
[2:27:24] and yet we think we are worshiping God
[2:27:27] when we are not able to surrender and
[2:27:29] say, "Lord, I give it to you. I don't
[2:27:31] understand it, Lord. Father, if it left
[2:27:33] with me, I don't want to do it, Lord
[2:27:35] God. But this is what your word said. I
[2:27:37] surrender myself
[2:27:38] [Music]
[2:27:43] We have crowned ourself on our throne.
[2:27:46] Lord Father, I pray oh God that Lord you
[2:27:49] would just help us Lord God in this hour
[2:27:51] as we have brought an introduction
[2:27:53] Father God to this subject Lord God.
[2:27:55] Father we come here Lord God to worship
[2:27:58] you. You are the one oh God we want to
[2:28:00] worship. You are the one oh father God
[2:28:02] we want we want to feel your presence
[2:28:04] Lord God.
[2:28:06] It's not it's not all Father God, Lord
[2:28:09] Jesus,
[2:28:11] just about Lord, Father God, and just
[2:28:13] coming together, Lord, and and making
[2:28:15] some noise, oh, Father God, but it's to
[2:28:17] be able to feed the reality, feed, oh
[2:28:20] God, the power of the new birth, Lord,
[2:28:23] the power of the Holy Ghost that can
[2:28:25] change your life, oh God, Father, that

[2:29:04] Lord. Father, this this was her own
[2:29:07] desire, Lord God. It's not something we
