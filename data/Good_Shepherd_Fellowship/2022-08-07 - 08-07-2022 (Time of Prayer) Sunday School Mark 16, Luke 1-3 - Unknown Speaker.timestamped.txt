[5:13] mary magdalene and mary the mother of
[5:15] james and salome had bought sweet spices
[5:18] that they might come and anoint him
[5:20] and very early in the morning the first
[5:21] day of the week they came onto the
[5:23] sepulcher at the rising of the sun
[5:25] and they said among themselves who shall
[5:27] roll us away the stone from the door of
[5:29] the sepulcher
[5:31] and when they looked
[5:33] they saw that the stone was rolled away
[5:36] for it was very great and entering into
[5:38] the sepulcher they saw a young man
[5:40] sitting on the right side clothed in a
[5:42] long white garment and they were
[5:44] frightened
[5:45] and he saith unto them be not a frighted
[5:48] ye seek jesus of nazareth which was
[5:50] crucified he is risen he is not here
[5:54] behold the place where they laid him
[5:57] but go your way tell his disciples and
[5:59] peter that he goeth before you into
[6:01] galilee
[6:02] there shall ye see him as he said unto
[6:04] you and they went out quickly and fled
[6:08] from the sepulcher for they trembled and
[6:10] were amazed
[6:11] neither said they anything to any man
[6:13] for they were afraid
[6:16] now when jesus was risen early the first
[6:19] day of the week he appeared first to
[6:21] mary magdalene out of whom he had cast
[6:23] seven devils
[6:25] and she went and told them that had been
[6:26] with him as they mourned and wept
[6:29] and they when they had heard that he was
[6:31] alive and had been seen of her believed
[6:33] not
[6:34] after that he appeared in another form
[6:36] onto two of them as they walked and went
[6:38] into the country
[6:39] and they went and told it onto the
[6:41] residue
[6:42] neither believed they them
[6:45] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as
[6:46] they sat at meat and upbraided them with
[6:48] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[6:50] because they believed not them which had
[6:52] seen him after he was risen
[6:54] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[6:57] world and preach the gospel to every
[6:59] creature
[7:00] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[7:02] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[7:05] be damned
[7:06] and these signs shall follow them that
[7:09] believe
[7:10] in my name shall they cast out devils
[7:14] they shall speak with new tongues they
[7:16] shall take up serpents
[7:18] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[7:20] shall not hurt them
[7:22] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[7:24] they shall recover
[7:27] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[7:29] them he was received up into heaven and
[7:32] sat on the right hand of god
[7:34] and they went forth and preached
[7:36] everywhere
[7:37] the lord working with them and
[7:39] confirming the word with signs following
[7:48] for as much as many have taken in hand
[7:50] to set forth in order a declaration of
[7:52] those things which are most surely
[7:54] believed among us
[7:55] even as they delivered them unto us
[7:57] which from the beginning were
[7:58] eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
[8:01] it seemed good to me also having had
[8:03] perfect understanding of all things from
[8:05] the very first to write unto thee in
[8:07] order most excellent theophilus that
[8:09] thou might just know the certainty of
[8:11] those things wherein thou hast been
[8:13] instructed
[8:15] there was in the days of herod the king
[8:17] of judea a certain priest named
[8:18] zacharias of the course of abiya
[8:21] and his wife was of the daughters of
[8:22] aaron and her name was elizabeth
[8:25] and they were both righteous before god
[8:27] walking in all the commandments and
[8:29] ordinances of the lord blameless
[8:31] and they had no child because that
[8:33] elizabeth was barren and they both were
[8:35] now well stricken in years
[8:38] and it came to pass that while he
[8:39] executed the priest's office before god
[8:42] in the order of his course according to
[8:44] the custom of the priest's office his
[8:46] lot was to burn incense when he went
[8:48] into the temple of the lord
[8:50] and the whole multitude of the people
[8:51] were praying without at the time of
[8:53] incense
[8:55] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[8:56] the lord standing on the right side of
[8:58] the altar of incense
[9:00] and when zacharias saw him he was
[9:02] troubled and fear fell upon him but the
[9:05] angel said unto him fear not zacharias
[9:07] for thy prayer is heard and thy wife
[9:10] elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou
[9:12] shalt call his name john and thou shalt
[9:14] have joy and gladness and many shall
[9:16] rejoice at his birth
[9:18] for he shall be great in the sight of
[9:19] the lord and shall drink neither wine
[9:21] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[9:23] with the holy ghost even from his
[9:25] mother's womb
[9:27] and many of the children of israel shall
[9:28] he turn to the lord their god
[9:31] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[9:32] and power of elias to turn the hearts of
[9:35] the fathers to the children and the
[9:36] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[9:39] make ready a people prepared for the
[9:41] lord
[9:43] and zechariah said unto the angel
[9:46] whereby shall i know this
[9:48] for i am an old man and my wife well
[9:51] stricken in years
[9:53] and the angel answering said unto him i
[9:55] am gabriel that stand in the presence of
[9:57] god and am sent to speak unto thee and
[9:59] to show thee these glad tidings
[10:02] and behold thou shalt be dumb and not
[10:05] able to speak until the day that these
[10:07] things shall be performed because thou
[10:09] believest not my words which shall be
[10:12] fulfilled in their season
[10:15] and the people waited for zacharias and
[10:17] marveled that he tarried so long in the
[10:19] temple
[10:20] and when he came out
[10:22] he could not speak unto them
[10:24] and they perceived that he had seen a
[10:26] vision in the temple for he beckoned
[10:28] unto them and remained
[10:30] speechless and it came to pass that as
[10:33] soon as the days of his administration
[10:34] were accomplished he departed to his own
[10:36] house
[10:37] and after those days his wife elizabeth
[10:40] conceived and hid herself five months
[10:43] saying
[10:44] thus hath the lord dealt with me in the
[10:46] days wherein he looked on me to take
[10:48] away my reproach among men
[10:51] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[10:54] was sent from god onto a city of galilee
[10:56] named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a
[10:59] man whose name was joseph of the house
[11:01] of david and the virgin's name was mary
[11:04] and the angel came in unto her and said
[11:06] hail thou that ought highly favored the
[11:09] lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[11:12] women
[11:13] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[11:15] his saying and cast in her mind what
[11:17] manner of salutation this should be
[11:20] and the angel said unto her fear not
[11:22] mary for thou hast found favor with god
[11:26] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[11:28] womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[11:30] call his name jesus
[11:32] he shall be great and shall be called
[11:34] the son of the highest and the lord god
[11:36] shall give unto him the throne of his
[11:38] father david and he shall reign over the
[11:40] house of jacob forever and of his
[11:42] kingdom there shall be no end
[11:45] then said mary unto the angel
[11:48] how shall this be
[11:49] seeing i know not a man
[11:52] and the angel answered and said unto her
[11:54] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[11:57] the power of the highest shall
[11:58] overshadow thee
[11:59] therefore also that holy thing which
[12:01] shall be born of thee shall be called
[12:03] the son of god
[12:05] and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath
[12:08] also conceived a son in her old age and
[12:10] this is the sixth month with her who was
[12:13] called barren
[12:14] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[12:18] and mary said
[12:19] behold the handmaid of the lord be it
[12:22] unto me according to thy word
[12:24] and the angel departed from her
[12:27] and mary arose in those days and went
[12:30] into the hill country with haste into a
[12:31] city of judah and entered into the house
[12:34] of zacharias and saluted elizabeth
[12:37] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[12:39] heard the salutation of mary the babe
[12:42] leaped in her womb
[12:44] and elizabeth was filled with the holy
[12:46] ghost and she spake out with a loud
[12:48] voice and said blessed art thou among
[12:50] women and blessed is the fruit of thy
[12:52] womb
[12:54] and whence is this to me that the mother
[12:56] of my lord should come to me
[12:58] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[13:00] salutation sounded in mine ears the babe
[13:03] leaped in my womb for joy
[13:06] and blessed is she that believed
[13:08] for there shall be a performance of
[13:09] those things which were told her from
[13:11] the lord
[13:13] and mary said
[13:15] my soul doth magnify the lord
[13:17] and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my
[13:20] savior
[13:21] for he hath regarded the lowest state of
[13:23] his handmaiden
[13:24] for behold from henceforth all
[13:27] generations shall call me blessed
[13:30] for he that is mighty hath done to me
[13:32] great things and holy is his name and
[13:35] his mercy is on them that fear him from
[13:37] generation to generation
[13:39] he hath showed strength with his arm he
[13:42] had scattered the proud in the
[13:43] imagination of their hearts he hath put
[13:45] down the mighty from their seats and
[13:47] exalted them of low degree he hath
[13:49] filled the hungry with good things and
[13:52] the rich he had sent empty away he had
[13:54] hope in his servant israel in
[13:56] remembrance of his mercy as he spake to
[13:59] our fathers to abraham and to his seed
[14:02] forever
[14:04] and mary abode with her about three
[14:06] months and returned to her own house
[14:10] now elizabeth's full time came that she
[14:12] should be delivered and she brought
[14:14] forth a son
[14:15] and her neighbors and her cousins heard
[14:17] how the lord had showed great mercy upon
[14:18] her and they rejoiced with her
[14:21] and it came to pass that on the eighth
[14:22] day they came to circumcise the child
[14:25] and they called him zacharias after the
[14:27] name of his father
[14:29] and his mother answered and said not so
[14:32] but he shall be called john
[14:34] and they said unto her there is none of
[14:36] thy kindred that is called by this name
[14:39] and they made signs to his father how he
[14:41] would have him called and he asked for a
[14:43] writing table and wrote saying
[14:46] his name is john
[14:48] and they marveled all
[14:50] and his mouth was opened immediately and
[14:53] his tongue loosed and he spake and
[14:55] praised god
[14:56] and fear came on all that dwelt round
[14:59] about them
[15:00] and all these sayings were noised abroad
[15:02] throughout all the hill country of judea
[15:05] and all they that heard them laid them
[15:07] up in their hearts saying what manner of
[15:09] child shall this be
[15:12] and the hand of the lord was with him
[15:14] and his father zacharias was filled with
[15:16] the holy ghost and prophesied saying
[15:19] blessed be the lord god of israel for he
[15:21] hath visited and redeemed his people and
[15:23] hath raised up and horn of salvation for
[15:25] us in the house of his servant david as
[15:28] he spake by the mouth of his holy
[15:29] prophets which have been since the world
[15:31] began
[15:33] that we should be saved from our enemies
[15:35] and from the hand of all that hate us
[15:37] to perform the mercy promised to our
[15:39] fathers and to remember his holy
[15:41] covenant
[15:42] the oath which he swear to our father
[15:44] abraham that he would grant unto us that
[15:48] we being delivered out of the hand of
[15:49] our enemies might serve him without fear
[15:52] in holiness and righteousness before him
[15:54] all the days of our life
[15:57] and thou child shalt be called the
[15:59] prophet of the highest for thou shalt go
[16:01] before the face of the lord to prepare
[16:03] his ways
[16:04] to give knowledge of salvation unto his
[16:07] people by the remission of their sins
[16:09] through the tender mercy of our god
[16:12] whereby the day spring from on high hath
[16:14] visited us to give light to them that
[16:16] sit in darkness and in the shadow of
[16:18] death
[16:19] to guide our feet into the way of peace
[16:24] and the child grew and waxed strong in
[16:27] spirit and was in the deserts till the
[16:29] day of his showing unto israel
[16:36] and it came to pass in those days that
[16:38] there went out a decree from caesar
[16:40] augustus that all the world should be
[16:42] taxed
[16:43] and this taxing was first made when
[16:45] cyrenius was governor of syria
[16:48] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[16:50] his own city
[16:51] and joseph also went up from galilee out
[16:53] of the city of nazareth into judea unto
[16:56] the city of david which is called
[16:57] bethlehem because he was of the house
[16:59] and lineage of david to be taxed with
[17:02] mary his espoused wife being great with
[17:04] child
[17:06] and so it was that while they were there
[17:08] the days were accomplished that she
[17:10] should be delivered
[17:11] and she brought forth her first born son
[17:14] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[17:16] laid him in a manger
[17:31] of the lord shone round about them and
[17:33] they were sore afraid
[17:35] and the angel said unto them fear not
[17:37] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[17:40] great joy which shall be to all people
[17:43] for unto you was born this day in the
[17:44] city of david a savior which is christ
[17:47] the lord
[17:49] and this shall be a sign unto you he
[17:51] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[17:53] clothes lying in a manger
[17:56] and suddenly there was with the angel a
[17:58] multitude of the heavenly host praising
[18:00] god and saying glory to god in the
[18:03] highest and on earth peace good will
[18:06] toward men
[18:08] and it came to pass as the angels were
[18:10] gone away from them into heaven the
[18:12] shepherds said one to another let us now
[18:14] go even unto bethlehem and see this
[18:17] thing which has come to pass which the
[18:18] lord hath made known unto us
[18:21] and they came with haste
[18:22] and found mary and joseph
[18:25] and the babe lying in a manger and when
[18:28] they had seen it they made known abroad
[18:30] the saying which was told them
[18:31] concerning this child
[18:33] and all they that heard it wondered at
[18:34] those things which were told them by the
[18:36] shepherds
[18:38] but mary
[18:39] kept all these things
[18:41] and pondered them in her heart
[18:44] and the shepherds returned glorifying
[18:46] and praising god for all the things that
[18:48] they had heard and seen as it was told
[18:50] unto them
[18:52] and when eight days were accomplished
[18:54] with the circumcising of the child his
[18:56] name was called jesus which was so named
[18:58] of the angel before he was conceived in
[19:00] the womb
[19:02] and when the days of her purification
[19:03] according to the law of moses were
[19:04] accomplished they brought him to
[19:06] jerusalem to present him to the lord as
[19:08] it is written in the law of the lord
[19:10] every male that openeth the womb shall
[19:12] be called holy to the lord
[19:14] and to offer a sacrifice according to
[19:17] that which is said in the law of the
[19:18] lord a pair of turtle doves or two young
[19:21] pigeons
[19:22] and behold there was a man in jerusalem
[19:25] whose name was simeon
[19:27] and the same man was just and devout
[19:29] waiting for the consolation of israel
[19:32] and the holy ghost was upon him
[19:34] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[19:36] ghost that he should not see death
[19:38] before he had seen the lord's christ
[19:41] and he came by the spirit into the
[19:43] temple
[19:45] and when the parents brought in the
[19:46] child jesus to do for him after the
[19:48] custom of the law
[19:50] then took he him up in his arms
[19:53] and blessed god
[19:54] and said
[19:56] lord
[19:57] now let us thou thy servant depart in
[19:59] peace according to thy word
[20:02] for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
[20:06] which thou hast prepared before the face
[20:08] of all people
[20:09] a light to lighten the gentiles
[20:12] and the glory of thy people israel
[20:16] and joseph and his mother
[20:18] marveled at those things which were
[20:19] spoken of him
[20:21] and simeon blessed them and said unto
[20:24] mary his mother
[20:25] behold this child is set for the fall
[20:28] and rising again of many in israel and
[20:30] for a sign which shall be spoken against
[20:33] yea
[20:34] a sword shall pierce through thy own
[20:37] soul also
[20:38] that the thoughts of many hearts may be
[20:40] revealed
[20:43] and there was one anna a prophetess the
[20:45] daughter of renewal of the tribe of acer
[20:47] she was of a great age and had lived
[20:49] with a husband seven years from her
[20:51] virginity and she was a widow of about
[20:53] four score and four years which departed
[20:56] not from the temple but served god with
[20:58] fastings and prayers night and day
[21:01] and she coming in that instant gave
[21:03] thanks likewise unto the lord and spake
[21:05] of him to all them that looked for
[21:06] redemption jerusalem
[21:09] and when they had performed all things
[21:10] according to the law of the lord they
[21:12] returned into galilee to their own city
[21:14] nazareth
[21:15] and the child grew and waxed strong in
[21:18] spirit filled with wisdom and the grace
[21:21] of god was upon him
[21:24] now his parents went to jerusalem every
[21:25] year at the feast of the passover
[21:28] and when he was 12 years old they went
[21:30] up to jerusalem after the custom of the
[21:31] feast and when they had fulfilled the
[21:34] days as they returned the child jesus
[21:36] tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph
[21:38] and his mother knew not of it but they
[21:41] supposing him to have been in the
[21:42] company went a day's journey
[21:44] and they sought him among their kinsfolk
[21:46] and acquaintance
[21:47] and when they found him not they turned
[21:49] back again to jerusalem seeking him
[21:51] and it came to pass that after three
[21:53] days they found him in the temple
[21:55] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[21:57] hearing them and asking them questions
[22:00] and all that heard him were astonished
[22:02] at his understanding and answers
[22:05] and when they saw him they were amazed
[22:08] and his mother said unto him son why
[22:10] hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy
[22:12] father and i have sought thee sorrowing
[22:15] and he said unto them how is it that ye
[22:18] sought me
[22:19] wisty not that i must be about my
[22:21] father's business
[22:23] and they understood not the saying which
[22:25] he spake unto them
[22:27] and he went down with them and came to
[22:29] nazareth and was subject unto them
[22:32] but his mother kept all these sayings in
[22:34] her heart
[22:36] and jesus increased in wisdom and
[22:38] stature and in favor with god and man
[22:42] now in the fifteenth year of the reign
[22:44] of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being
[22:47] governor of judea and herod being
[22:49] tetrarch of galilee and his brother
[22:51] philip t trock of ituria and of the
[22:53] region of trachonitis
[22:55] and lysanias the teatroc of abellini
[22:58] annas and caiaphas being the high
[22:59] priests
[23:01] the word of god came unto john the son
[23:03] of zacharias in the wilderness
[23:05] and he came into all the country about
[23:06] jordan
[23:28] anas and caiaphas being the high priests
[23:30] the word of god came unto john the son
[23:33] of zacharias in the wilderness
[23:35] and he came into all the country about
[23:36] jordan preaching the baptism of
[23:38] repentance for the remission of sins as
[23:41] it is written in the book of the words
[23:42] of isis the prophet saying
[23:44] the voice of one crying in the
[23:46] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[23:48] lord make his paths straight
[23:51] every valley shall be filled and every
[23:53] mountain and hill shall be brought low
[23:55] and the crooked shall be made straight
[23:57] and the rough ways shall be made smooth
[23:59] and all flesh shall see the salvation of
[24:02] god
[24:04] then said he to the multitude that came
[24:05] forth to be baptized of him o generation
[24:08] of vipers
[24:10] who hath warned you to flee from the
[24:11] wrath to come
[24:13] bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
[24:15] repentance and begin not to say within
[24:17] yourselves we have abraham to our father
[24:21] for i say unto you that god is able of
[24:23] these stones to raise up children unto
[24:25] abraham
[24:27] and now also the axe is laid onto the
[24:29] root of the trees
[24:31] every tree therefore which bringeth not
[24:33] forth good fruit is hewn down and cast
[24:35] into the fire
[24:37] and the people asked him saying what
[24:39] shall we do then
[24:40] he answereth and saith unto them
[24:42] he that hath two coats
[24:45] let him impart to him that hath none
[24:47] and he that hath meet let him do
[24:49] likewise
[24:51] and came also publicans to be baptized
[24:53] and said unto him master what shall we
[24:55] do
[24:56] and he said unto them exact no more than
[24:59] that which has appointed you
[25:01] and the soldiers likewise demanded of
[25:03] him saying and what shall we do
[25:05] and he said unto them do violence to no
[25:08] man neither accuse any falsely
[25:11] and be content with your wages
[25:15] and as the people were in expectation
[25:17] and all men mused in their hearts of
[25:19] john whether he were the christ or not
[25:22] john answered saying unto them all i
[25:24] indeed baptize you with water but one
[25:27] mightier than i cometh the latchette of
[25:29] whose shoes i am not worthy to and loose
[25:31] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[25:34] and with fire
[25:35] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[25:38] throughly purge his floor and will
[25:40] gather the wheat into his garner
[25:42] but the chaff he will burn with fire
[25:45] unquenchable
[25:47] and many other things in his exhortation
[25:49] preached he unto the people
[25:52] but herod the teatrock being reproved by
[25:54] him for herodius his brother philip's
[25:56] wife and for all the evils which herod
[25:58] had done
[25:59] added yet this above all
[26:01] that he shut up john in prison
[26:05] now when all the people were baptized it
[26:06] came to pass that jesus also being
[26:08] baptized and praying the heaven was
[26:10] opened and the holy ghost descended in a
[26:13] bodily shape like a dove upon him and a
[26:15] voice came from heaven which said thou
[26:17] art my beloved son in thee i am well
[26:20] pleased
