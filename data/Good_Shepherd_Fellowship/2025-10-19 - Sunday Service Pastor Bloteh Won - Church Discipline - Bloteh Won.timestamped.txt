[1:16] Shall we pray?
[1:20] Our Lord and our Savior Jesus, we thank
[1:23] you so much, oh God, for this morning.
[1:27] We are so grateful, Father,
[1:30] that we have lived to see this day
[1:34] and that we are witnesses
[1:38] of your greatness.
[1:41] For we have tasted
[1:44] of your divine love,
[1:46] your mercies,
[1:49] salvation,
[1:51] your peace, your joy. There is no
[1:55] denying that Lord.
[1:57] We are so grateful Lord
[2:01] that you have preserved our lives
[2:04] and have preserved our souls
[2:07] and have brought us this far.
[2:10] That we have only come this far purely
[2:12] by grace. Lord,
[2:15] we just thank you so much, Father, for
[2:18] the miracles thou have wrought in our
[2:21] lives.
[2:23] And Father, we give you the glory this
[2:24] morning and we give you the honor,
[2:27] Father. And we praise thine holy name,
[2:29] Father, this morning. And we bless you
[2:32] with all our hearts and with all that is
[2:34] within us, Father, in the name of Jesus.
[2:39] More than ever before, Father, we pray.
[2:43] Deepen our hunger for your word. Let us
[2:48] thirst and hunger for your word like
[2:51] nothing else matters. Lord,
[2:53] &gt;&gt; let us crave for your word, Father, with
[2:57] passion, Lord.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray in the name of Jesus
[3:02] more than ever before. Give us that
[3:03] determination Lord
[3:06] that Father
[3:10] we shall please thee
[3:13] under every circumstances.
[3:18] It doesn't matter
[3:20] how much we are tossed about
[3:23] by the storms of this life.
[3:26] One thing is sure that our ankle holds.
[3:31] It doesn't matter how high we are tossed
[3:33] by by the waves or how far we drift
[3:36] away. One thing is sure, praise be to
[3:39] your holy name, Father, that your ankle
[3:42] holds within the veil. Wonderful Jesus,
[3:46] what a great God you are.
[3:49] We have come that we may hear from you
[3:51] this morning.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; And we pray that you will speak to us.
[3:57] A lot of requests have been tabled
[3:59] before you this morning. Our brother,
[4:01] brother Loyal's birthday today. We are
[4:05] so grateful that you have added another
[4:06] year to his years. We pray that father
[4:10] oh God you will cause your face to shine
[4:13] upon him and may you bless him and
[4:16] father bless his ministry and we pray
[4:19] that more than ever before you will take
[4:22] the center stage in his life and prosper
[4:25] him beyond leaps and bounds.
[4:29] My Mary is due to travel the first week
[4:31] of next month for her for her daughter's
[4:34] memorial. We commit her journey, Father,
[4:37] into thine hands
[4:39] &gt;&gt; that you will carry her safely and bring
[4:41] her safely back.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; Father, she is in your arms of love.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Guide and protect and deliver her,
[4:47] Father, in Jesus name.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; Our brother Bobby Wes has passed away.
[4:55] We commit the family into your hands. We
[4:59] pray that you will give them strength in
[5:02] this time of difficulty
[5:05] and just minister onto them
[5:08] beyond what human words could ever do.
[5:12] We want to thank you for little Olivia
[5:15] that is not feeling very fine. We pray
[5:19] that you'll go and minister healing onto
[5:21] her this moment
[5:23] &gt;&gt; and give her strength.
[5:25] We pray pleading the blood of Jesus upon
[5:27] her. Father and father we pray oh God
[5:31] may you break every yoke of the enemy
[5:34] that may be hanging over her life and
[5:37] let your glory fill her life in Jesus
[5:40] name.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Come take complete control over as many
[5:44] of us that have gathered before you and
[5:46] father minister unto us according to our
[5:48] needs. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[5:54] Praise the Lord.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; I owe God one testimony.
[6:03] Praise the Lord. And probably I should
[6:06] start with that.
[6:10] A check was issued in my wife's name
[6:12] last week and we were just shredding
[6:16] things.
[6:18] And normally when a letter lies down too
[6:21] long and I take it, I don't even care
[6:23] what is inside. I just put it through
[6:26] the shredder. So I took this and for
[6:30] some reason I opened it. Even when I
[6:32] opened it, I wasn't so satisfied. And
[6:35] something said, "Just look." When I
[6:36] looked, it was a check that was written,
[6:39] a genuine check of $800 and something
[6:42] dollars. So I showed it to her. She
[6:46] said, "No, I wasn't expecting this." I
[6:48] said it's a genuine check. She said okay
[6:50] let's keep it and call the people on
[6:52] Monday. So we kept it over the weekends
[6:55] and I said no there is no reason keeping
[6:57] it. It's genuine. We are going to cash
[6:59] it.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Then I started looking for it. I
[7:04] couldn't find a check. We turned
[7:06] everything everything upside down in the
[7:08] house. We couldn't find a check.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; I put it in a folder. Everything in the
[7:15] folder was there. things I didn't need
[7:18] but the very thing I needed the most was
[7:21] not there which was the check
[7:24] so we went praying and I promise God
[7:28] when I find a check I will come and
[7:30] testify to it
[7:33] &gt;&gt; the following morning gas came down
[7:36] because I I sleep in the living room
[7:40] and we said gasville I've been looking
[7:42] for a check did you see any check he
[7:45] said
[7:46] And then the mother said, "Just stretch
[7:49] this chair and look under." I said, "No,
[7:51] I did that twice already." And then when
[7:53] he stretched the chair, I mean the chair
[7:55] and looked under there was nothing. He
[7:58] said, "Mommy, there is nothing." The
[8:00] mother said, "Come and take this
[8:01] flashlight and look down there." And lo
[8:03] and behold, when he took it, it was just
[8:07] lined up with the side of the chair and
[8:10] there was no way you could see it. And
[8:13] she saw he saw the check. I said,
[8:16] "Praise the Lord."
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; So, we found that check. You know, when
[8:20] you have too much, $800 doesn't mean
[8:22] anything.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; But when that 800 is something you are
[8:27] depending on to do something,
[8:29] &gt;&gt; it's more than $8,000.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; And I just thank God for it.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; And I give God the glory for it.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:40] I just want to tell you my wife's
[8:42] surgery went very very well.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; She sends her greetings.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; When we went,
[8:54] in fact, when they came to carry her to
[8:57] the surgical room, she was just on the
[9:00] bed praying.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; I was sitting down and they came and
[9:04] they were telling her, "Ma'am, we have
[9:06] come to take." She didn't even care. She
[9:09] was not She was not listening.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; She was just praying and they were
[9:14] talking to her. She was just praying.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; And then they said, "Okay, you can go
[9:18] and wait in the lobby. When we are done,
[9:21] we'll come and get you." I said, "Okay."
[9:23] &gt;&gt; And they were healing her away and she
[9:25] was praying
[9:26] &gt;&gt; unknown to me. She was praying in even
[9:30] she go to the surgical room praying
[9:32] praying and she broke in tongues.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the surgical room and they were
[9:37] holding her and she was shaking and she
[9:40] said the rest was history. She didn't
[9:42] know where she ended. She just woke up
[9:44] and realized they had finished with
[9:46] their surgery. Praise the Lord.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; God answers prayer.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; We want to thank you for your prayers.
[9:55] Everything was very very successful. I
[9:57] was in the lobby. The doctor came out
[9:58] and called me
[10:00] &gt;&gt; and said your wife surgery went very
[10:02] very well. All the parts went in
[10:05] perfectly well. You could see from the
[10:08] doctor's face how happy he was.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; And in fact, she is recovering at a very
[10:14] fantastic rate.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; We went to the hospital last Thursday
[10:17] for her physical therapy. The therapist
[10:21] was telling her this is the first time I
[10:25] have seen somebody come for their first
[10:27] visit and do what you are doing.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; It's just amazing what she's doing.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we just want to thank you for
[10:35] your prayers and uh God is still
[10:38] answering prayer.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you all in Jesus name.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Let's put our hands together for Jesus
[10:50] this morning. Hallelujah.

[35:31] Praise the Lord for strength this
[35:33] morning. We we got it we got it just a
[35:36] few hours ago uh from uh Turkey. We want
[35:40] to support one of our our friend young
[35:44] man that visited us here year before
[35:47] doing their wedding. Uh so we went his
[35:50] dad was a good friend, very good friend.
[35:53] Knew him since uh 1994 95 when I moved
[35:58] to the coast. He was the voice of God
[36:01] representative there and uh uh we had
[36:04] good friendship
[36:06] over the years. We work together but uh
[36:10] the father passed away a couple of years
[36:13] ago and u and the mother uh was not able
[36:18] to get her visa come for the wedding. So
[36:22] a lot of his uh dad friends they all
[36:25] decided to go and support him and uh so
[36:29] I was able to uh take a lift with Ariel
[36:33] and his wife. They were supposed to stay
[36:37] but then uh I told them I would need a
[36:41] bit back home also. So I had a copy stay
[36:44] shocked and right after the wedding
[36:48] uh we cut away from the reception and
[36:51] took the road home. So but we thank the
[36:53] Lord he granted us a a safe trip back
[36:56] home and he's going to be there in the
[36:58] house of the Lord this morning. Amen.
[37:01] Praise the Lord. So u uh I'm saying
[37:05] things I'm not saying where I might be
[37:07] sleeping. So just bear with me with that
[37:10] one. Praise the Lord. And uh uh
[37:17] the Lord has been good to us. Uh we we
[37:20] want to again announce uh the first
[37:22] weekend uh that will be the first and
[37:24] the second we will have forest farmer
[37:27] with us. and uh that weekend
[37:32] first has been a good friend to this
[37:34] assembly over the years and uh we love
[37:38] having him to come. Praise the Lord. Uh
[37:41] I promise you, you will enjoy the
[37:42] weekend. Amen.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; He's a he's a good he's a nice brother
[37:48] with such a burden for the word of God
[37:51] and for the people of God. Amen.
[37:54] And then uh uh the Wednesday that follow
[37:57] after our sister Rebecca our uncle will
[38:00] be passing through Minneapolis and uh so
[38:03] he will speak for us on Wednesday. We
[38:06] thought we could get him over to grace
[38:07] ministry on Thursday but brother Don
[38:09] Hoffman would not be around. So we we
[38:12] will just have that Wednesday service
[38:15] with him and then he will go over to uh
[38:19] uh
[38:21] Ohio to be with brother child that
[38:24] weekend.
[38:27] So, uh
[38:29] uh I think so far that's uh what uh we
[38:35] have on our plate this morning for for
[38:38] announcement.
[38:40] This morning actually I had a I had a
[38:44] couple of few things I wanted to speak
[38:46] about and uh uh but I also now want to
[38:52] have a long service because I don't know
[38:53] if my body will be able to take take it
[38:57] and uh but this morning my my the actual
[39:00] subject that was on my mind was to talk
[39:02] a little bit on church discipline.
[39:06] I was going to talk on church
[39:08] discipline. I was going to go into you
[39:11] uh um Acts chapter 5 and uh and begin
[39:15] from there. But uh uh since I don't want
[39:19] to hold you too long, uh we just I'm
[39:22] just going to trust the Lord this
[39:23] morning, I also had a lot of thought on
[39:25] my heart that I wanted to to share with
[39:28] you. So we would just trust the Lord to
[39:31] be able to help us uh as we as we go in
[39:34] the word this morning. So, thank you
[39:37] musicians
[39:38] and uh let's just uh go right in the
[39:41] word as we as we will read the scripture
[39:44] and just ask the Lord to be able to give
[39:48] us a sense of direction here. Praise the
[39:51] Lord. Uh to be able to give us a sense
[39:54] of direction.
[40:03] I will take uh just one verse out of the
[40:06] book of Job and then uh uh
[40:13] yeah and then we will
[40:19] go to the book of u
[40:23] the eyes of the apostle Job chapter
[40:28] Job chapter 36
[40:35] Job chapter 36.
[40:43] Praise the Lord.
[40:46] Job chapter 36
[40:51] and I'll read that and then uh whether
[40:54] it is what we will speak from but I will
[40:56] I I will just share with you a little
[40:58] bit and uh
[41:03] Job 36 verse 10
[41:12] Job 36 verse
[41:21] He openeth also their ears to discipline
[41:27] and commanded that they return from
[41:30] iniquity.
[41:32] If they obey and serve him, they shall
[41:35] spend their days in prosperity and their
[41:38] years in pleasure.
[41:40] But if they obey, they shall perish by
[41:44] the sword, and they shall die without
[41:48] knowledge.
[41:51] Father, we just want to thank you for
[41:53] the portion of your word that we have
[41:55] read this morning. And uh I pray that
[41:58] God, you would just please come and help
[42:00] us, Lord, that we will say something to
[42:03] your children this morning that will be
[42:05] encouraging, Father. And Lord God, and
[42:08] bless us for speaking and
[42:10] And as we commit all of our needs in
[42:13] your hands this morning and uh Sister
[42:16] Beh
[42:36] this morning we pray that God you bless
[42:39] my
[42:40] and just give her strength to her body.
[42:42] We love you Jesus. We love you father in
[42:46] your wonderful name. We pray with faith
[42:49] and thanksgiving. We remember
[42:53] this morning uh sister little niece.
[42:57] Father, we hope that the situation gets
[43:00] out of control and we just place all of
[43:04] these things in your hands. Lord, you
[43:06] are faithful. You are faithful. We thank
[43:08] you. We appreciate you. In Jesus name we
[43:11] pray.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have
[43:16] your seat.
[43:19] The Lord bless you. You may have your
[43:20] seat.
[43:22] And uh uh uh when we had our our church
[43:27] meeting, when we had our church meeting,
[43:29] we uh uh
[43:33] we spoke in terms of uh
[43:37] uh
[43:41] laboring together to be able to uh
[43:46] uh
[43:50] keep an atmosphere word of God can can
[43:53] come in our midst and uh and be able to
[43:57] bless us. Praise the Lord.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; And uh and in that re and in that uh uh
[44:05] thought of uh laboring together to be
[44:08] able to keep u
[44:12] a goal atmosphere in our mess
[44:17] is some of the reason why I have u have
[44:22] place on my heart to to kind of a talk
[44:25] on this. We we have to remember that
[44:28] brother Brandham says that uh God
[44:32] disciplined his children.
[44:34] Praise the Lord.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; God disciplined his children. And from
[44:38] the message of the hour, we understand
[44:40] also the difference between discipline
[44:42] and punishment.
[44:44] You know God is the god of discipline
[44:47] and uh uh punishment is for the wicked.
[44:51] Amen. Discipline is to be a character.
[44:55] So uh uh
[44:58] uh but the reason why I wanted to to uh
[45:03] to go into this
[45:06] you know when you when you just think
[45:08] about everything that is happening not
[45:10] only not only around our assembly but
[45:13] the word as a whole uh the word as a
[45:17] whole. Oh my god, I forgot.
[45:20] I forgot. I'll keep you for another
[45:22] time.
[45:24] There's there was there's a little video
[45:26] I wanted to show you. Um yeah, I forget
[45:29] forget about it. That's funny. And I
[45:32] think the reason why I forgot about it
[45:34] because uh I'm I'm getting away from my
[45:38] uh uh
[45:40] uh subject that we been talking about.
[45:44] Revelation chapter 5. uh Wednesday night
[45:46] we were talking about the seven spirit
[45:49] and it took us to look at uh the eye of
[45:51] God moving to and for throughout the
[45:53] earth. I also I also thought I will
[45:56] continue from there but uh this was more
[45:59] wearing on my heart because uh uh u
[46:07] there was we were we were going to bring
[46:09] this subject to you and bring a matter
[46:11] to you but uh we will bring this subject
[46:14] without the matter because uh uh uh we
[46:19] still have to to
[46:23] talk some with the deacons.
[46:26] So I will I will just deal with the
[46:28] subject now. So uh uh so with everything
[46:32] with everything that is that is
[46:34] happening around us, we realize that uh
[46:38] our age is under such uh tremendous
[46:41] pressure. Amen. Tremendous pressure. And
[46:45] what we've been told from the word of
[46:47] God by the prophet of the hour is there
[46:50] when Holy Ghost is leaving there will be
[46:53] enough demon power rising the people on
[46:57] the earth and uh uh and you can see it
[47:01] everywhere you know
[47:04] people are under pressure you know
[47:07] people are under pressure some of our
[47:09] our actions and reactions is all because
[47:14] of pressure.
[47:16] But uh the Lord is faithful. Amen. He's
[47:20] very faithful. And that is the reason
[47:22] why we've been kind of dwelling on that
[47:25] subject of the the the rider and the
[47:27] beast because we want to show you the
[47:30] the power that is that is pressurizing
[47:33] us for for for evil and then also show
[47:38] the power of God that is combating it.
[47:41] Amen. Because uh uh let let's be assure
[47:46] let's assure ourself in a sense that
[47:50] none of us in our physical mind we know
[47:53] that one can be able to stand against
[47:56] the enemy. None of us with all that we
[47:59] know about the word of God we can be
[48:01] able to stand. You know brother Brandham
[48:03] says overcoming is to know the devil by
[48:05] his tricks. Praise the Lord. is
[48:08] something that we say. But how do you
[48:11] know this this devil that have been
[48:14] deceiving? He deceived the wisest man,
[48:16] the strongest man, and uh uh uh uh I
[48:20] mean he's he's been here almost 6,000
[48:22] years more than you or myself, how we
[48:26] can really grab him by all his tricks.
[48:30] So the purpose of bringing their subject
[48:33] is to be able to show us the important
[48:38] one of having a messenger of having a
[48:41] prophet.
[48:43] The important of having the prophet, the
[48:45] important of being on a prophet
[48:48] ministry.
[48:50] Praise the Lord.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Because just like we said Wednesday
[48:53] night and we saw it in the word of God,
[48:55] uh uh that's the eye of God.
[48:58] Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; That is the art of God. So it is the
[49:02] message of the hour that grab the enemy
[49:05] in his tracks.
[49:09] Is the message of the hour that expose
[49:12] to us the tricks of the devil.
[49:16] Praise the Lord.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Because just like the scripture says, it
[49:21] is so close that even it would deceive
[49:23] the very ear. So that is the reason why
[49:27] that you know I've been I just been
[49:28] going around that subject to be able to
[49:31] just break it into pieces and and make
[49:33] it a little bit simple for us to be able
[49:35] to understand but that is the place
[49:37] where I'm coming to
[49:40] you know that is the place where I'm
[49:42] coming to is not just to show us uh uh
[49:45] uh colors or just to uh uh but for us to
[49:48] be able to see
[49:51] how blessed we are, how privileged we
[49:53] are.
[49:54] Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; It's almost like Bam says that God gave
[50:00] his children the best weapon
[50:03] &gt;&gt; and that was the word.
[50:05] Praise the Lord.
[50:08] So if we if we if we see all of those
[50:10] things and understand it then you will
[50:13] know that when you leave the word in
[50:17] whatever way you have just exposed
[50:20] yourself for trouble.
[50:25] Praise the Lord.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; When you leave the word,
[50:29] you have just exposed yourself for
[50:32] trouble. And remember the Bible says
[50:35] that the devil know that his time is
[50:38] out.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; He know that he does not have any time.
[50:44] So he's ready to throw anything at you.
[50:47] Anything he can get in his hands to
[50:50] throw at you, he's ready to throw it at
[50:53] you.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; If he can just get you frustrated.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; If he can just get you frustrated,
[51:04] that's that I mean that that just all he
[51:06] just want to rob you. He comes to steal,
[51:08] kill, and destroy.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; He just come to rob you.
[51:15] I think one thing that the devil knows
[51:17] there is they are the uh uh he can't
[51:20] change a a seed of God to a seed of the
[51:23] devil or the seed of the serpent. He
[51:25] cannot do it.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; But if he can cause you to be so rough
[51:30] that you can never enjoy this salvation
[51:33] that is freely given to you.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; That you can never enjoy it.
[51:42] you you would just you just go from one
[51:44] cycle to another cycle to another
[51:47] problem to another problem because what
[51:49] he's trying to do is to destroy the
[51:52] confidence of God's word
[51:56] &gt;&gt; frustrates you so much that it looks to
[51:59] you that there is nothing in this Bible
[52:01] is truth.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:09] And then uh we just become a miserable
[52:12] son of God or the miserable daughter of
[52:14] God uh uh all of our days on the earth.
[52:24] So that is the reason why we are we we
[52:27] we are dwelling on that subject
[52:30] and uh uh
[52:38] so when you look when you look all
[52:39] through the scripture
[52:41] something I was I was I was uh I was
[52:44] looking at uh lying down just meditating
[52:47] that came to my mind I was just looking
[52:49] at some parallel
[52:51] uh uh through the scripture and some of
[52:52] the things that uh that happens through
[52:55] uh uh uh the scripture. Now the the
[52:59] Bible would tell us uh uh right uh uh
[53:04] even right there in Eden. Let me try to
[53:07] find my way to this as quick as I can
[53:10] and uh uh just just to be able to bring
[53:13] something that will that can be edifying
[53:15] to you this morning. When the first son
[53:18] of God uh uh uh fell from God's
[53:21] principle, left God's word, God came
[53:24] down and brother Brandon make us to know
[53:28] God judge sin right to where sin
[53:32] happened. Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; He judged it right there in Eden and he
[53:37] also judged it in the body that sin was
[53:40] committed in.
[53:43] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; He told Eve in pain and sorrow he told
[53:47] Adam you know from the sweat of your
[53:50] brow.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; So even even the even the even the white
[53:59] judgment when God is judging sin it will
[54:01] be right back here.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; On earth.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And the body that sin was committed
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; is the body that sin will be judged in.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:14] because that's God's principle. That's
[54:16] what he did in the beginning.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; And and so with that principle in mind,
[54:26] we can see that
[54:29] whatsoever we sow in this body,
[54:32] &gt;&gt; we will reap it in this body.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[54:43] The right through judgment is not going
[54:45] to be in heaven. It's going to be here
[54:47] on earth because uh sin was committed
[54:50] here on earth.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; And we will not be judged or sinners
[54:56] will not be judged because there is no
[54:58] condemnation to them that are in Christ.
[55:00] Are you glad for that?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; That we have passed from death onto
[55:04] life.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; So sinners will not be judged in
[55:07] celestial body.
[55:09] s will be judged in the body that sin
[55:12] was committed.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[55:22] Now, so so uh uh uh with that in mind, I
[55:26] I just want to run you a little bit when
[55:30] you look through the principle and and
[55:32] what I was thinking about is that the
[55:37] uh the the the first evil that was done
[55:40] uh appreciate the service last Sunday.
[55:42] Yeah, brother, you were talking a little
[55:43] bit about that going back to Eden and
[55:45] all of that. We know that uh uh that was
[55:49] uh uh that that was idolatry.
[55:53] Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Adultery was the act that was committed.
[56:00] But the sin
[56:02] was unbelief.
[56:05] That's why brother Brandham said sin is
[56:07] unbelief.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; The sin was unbelief because she left
[56:14] the word.
[56:16] And because she left the word, her body
[56:19] was now exposed
[56:21] &gt;&gt; to the art.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; The art was the result of the scene.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:36] &gt;&gt; So you see there all through the
[56:38] scripture. Another place you look at,
[56:41] you will see in the songs of Judah,
[56:44] Reuben was the firstborn,
[56:47] but Ruben was stripped of the
[56:49] birthright. He was stripped of the
[56:51] priesthood and and the kingship.
[56:54] Why? Because he committed uh uh an
[56:58] abominable act.
[57:00] He slept with his father's wife.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And because that was done, he was
[57:09] stripped of those things.
[57:12] Now watch now in the New Testament,
[57:17] Paul will show us a case in the book of
[57:21] Corinthian where there is another man in
[57:23] the church. That that was the Old
[57:26] Testament. Now in the New Testament
[57:28] church, there's another man in the
[57:30] church sleeping with his father's wife.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:35] And Paul will ask that that thing must
[57:38] not be mentioned among us. That man must
[57:40] be excommunicated.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; So in in in first Corinthian he was
[57:45] excommunicated. In second Corinthian he
[57:48] had repented and he was restored to the
[57:50] church.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:58] Now, so you will see it and and another
[58:01] thing that that that that that grabbed
[58:03] my mind was that uh in in the book of
[58:07] Joshua, we know of Achon taking the
[58:12] Babylon.
[58:15] Praise the Lord.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And when he took the Babylon, he hid it
[58:19] in his tent. And we know that that thing
[58:23] caused death in the camp. And it it it
[58:26] caught Joshua attention because on a
[58:29] Joshua commission, God told him
[58:33] &gt;&gt; that I will be with you just like I was
[58:36] with Moses.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; So when those people died,
[58:44] Joshua called a certain assembly to find
[58:47] out what was going on.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; So he called the people and then finally
[58:55] we realized that uh uh it was Achan that
[58:58] stole the Babylonian army. Praise the
[59:01] Lord. Now watch the principle here.
[59:05] Because of the wrong that that Achan
[59:08] did, it cost his entire family.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] It cost his entire family.
[59:21] Praise the Lord.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; When you come over in the New Testament,
[59:27] Acts chapter 5, I want to pick up
[59:29] something from there. Acts chapter 5,
[59:31] the Bible talks about another household,
[59:35] Ananas and Safar.
[59:37] Now I'm trying to show you a parallel
[59:41] of how God
[59:43] all through has brought some sense of
[59:46] discipline.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[59:53] &gt;&gt; now? So uh uh uh
[59:57] in Acts chapter 5, Acts chapter 5 never
[1:00:02] never give us the full picture of
[1:00:05] whether Ananas and Sophia had children.
[1:00:09] But what we know here in the in the
[1:00:12] scripture is that the Bible says both
[1:00:15] Ananas and Safar their bodies were
[1:00:18] packed
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; to the grave because they lied to the
[1:00:23] Holy Ghost.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; But what I want to show you the
[1:00:28] difference is that under the New
[1:00:31] Testament because of the blood of Jesus
[1:00:35] Christ,
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] If if if uh if Ananiah's wife will have
[1:00:42] come
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; and said,
[1:00:46] "No, I don't know about this thing. I I
[1:00:47] mean this thing is my husband." Amen. If
[1:00:50] she will have come and said the truth,
[1:00:53] the blood will have protected her.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; On the Old Testament, they never had the
[1:01:00] benefit of the blood like we have.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. One man saw a Babylonian garment,
[1:01:08] death run across the family.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; And uh in in the New Testament uh uh uh
[1:01:19] this man and his wife lied against the
[1:01:22] Holy Ghost. Both of them their body was
[1:01:24] packed to the grave. Are we together?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the reason why I I I I want
[1:01:32] you to see this is because brother
[1:01:35] Brandham said under the New Testament
[1:01:38] church that's the reason why church
[1:01:40] discipline we must be reminded of church
[1:01:43] discipline because he said because we
[1:01:46] are under the blood if a person is
[1:01:49] living wrong or doing wrong God will not
[1:01:51] do anything to them
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; until the church take them from under
[1:01:57] the blood.
[1:02:00] That's why Paul had to apply that
[1:02:03] principle.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Because the blood protects the body and
[1:02:10] when a person is identified with the
[1:02:13] body, baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:02:16] Jesus Christ in fellowship, partake of
[1:02:18] communion, partake of everything, you
[1:02:20] are under the protection of the church.
[1:02:25] And he says that is the reason why the
[1:02:28] New Testament church is doing poor.
[1:02:32] That's why the church is not standing in
[1:02:34] her strength.
[1:02:39] Why? Because we want big church. We want
[1:02:42] many people. So we allow everything to
[1:02:45] happen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:54] Looks like you were not expecting it.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I myself, I was not expecting it,
[1:03:02] too.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; I I promise you, I was not expecting it.
[1:03:10] Glory be to God.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Let's look in Acts chapter five. Like I
[1:03:20] said,
[1:03:22] let's look in Acts chapter 5.
[1:03:39] Let's read from verse 11.
[1:03:42] Acts chapter 5 from verse 11.
[1:03:46] Acts
[1:03:58] chapter 5 from verse 11 the Bible says
[1:04:01] and great fear came upon all the church
[1:04:04] and upon as many as heard these saints
[1:04:07] her wife that both Ananas and his wife
[1:04:09] died. Praise the Lord. Fear came upon
[1:04:12] the church and all those that here. And
[1:04:14] the Bible say verse 12. And by the hands
[1:04:17] of the apostle where many signs and
[1:04:21] wonders wrought among the people and
[1:04:25] they and and they were all with one
[1:04:28] accord in Solomon's porch. Listen to
[1:04:31] this. This is the verse I wanted to get.
[1:04:34] and the rest does no man join himself to
[1:04:38] them,
[1:04:40] but the people magnify God.
[1:04:44] Now you see because we we we we see this
[1:04:49] that you cannot join the church
[1:04:52] and it's true. You cannot join the
[1:04:54] church. The church is not an
[1:04:56] organization that you can join. Praise
[1:04:59] the Lord.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] Jim Setter
[1:05:05] uh help me with your friend there beside
[1:05:08] you. I don't want you sleeping now. So,
[1:05:11] uh uh uh the the church, you can't join
[1:05:14] the church. You you have to come by St.
[1:05:17] John chapter 3, the new birth. You got
[1:05:19] to be born again. Are we together?
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Because this is the family of God. This
[1:05:25] is not an association.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; This is not an association. And we we
[1:05:31] want to strive not to run the church as
[1:05:33] an association.
[1:05:36] We don't want to run it by no
[1:05:39] nationality influence.
[1:05:42] Praise the Lord. People come here, they
[1:05:44] meet me. Most of the time when I'm
[1:05:46] around you doing something, they ask
[1:05:48] say, "So, well, is there a Liberian
[1:05:49] church?" I say, "No,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; this is not a Liberian church. This is a
[1:05:54] Christian church."
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; If it was a Liberian church, we get a
[1:06:03] Liberian flag. But because it's a
[1:06:05] Christian Christian church, only the
[1:06:07] word of God we live up.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; It's not an association.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; And uh so the thing about it there is
[1:06:19] that the uh uh uh the church
[1:06:24] Yeah. The Bible let us know that because
[1:06:28] of the way that God were dealing dealing
[1:06:30] with the apostles, nobody joined him.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You don't join him. You got converted.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Nobody dare joined him.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And what what happened was there was
[1:06:46] such a presence.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; The people knew that
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; you you you God have to be dealing with
[1:06:57] you. You you have to you have to uh h
[1:07:02] have an experience with God. You
[1:07:04] remember Simon the sorceress when he
[1:07:06] came he saw what the apostle was doing
[1:07:09] and he he thought he could give some
[1:07:10] money to buy it. Peter say you and your
[1:07:13] money go to hell.
[1:07:20] So you don't join the church.
[1:07:23] It's not a body that you can join
[1:07:25] yourself to.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; So I mean uh uh uh when we when we get
[1:07:40] to this place and you know when in uh uh
[1:07:44] uh
[1:07:46] in the in in the same regard. We don't
[1:07:50] want to we don't want to set ourself up
[1:07:52] like uh like a like a like a c.
[1:07:57] No, we are not a c. This is not a set.
[1:07:59] This is not a c.
[1:08:02] This is the move of God.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the move of God where we
[1:08:10] believe that God has called us to govern
[1:08:13] our life by the word of God.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; So, we see it all through the scripture.
[1:08:21] He's a God of discipline.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; He's a God of discipline. I mean, I I
[1:08:27] was I was I was lying there the other
[1:08:29] night and and I was just thinking about
[1:08:31] it. I say uh which of course I've used
[1:08:33] this in the past but it just came back
[1:08:35] as a flashback to my mind and just
[1:08:37] running those parallel all through the
[1:08:39] scripture.
[1:08:41] Judah was rob of all of his inheritance.
[1:08:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; He was rob of all inheritance. The the
[1:08:52] breth was taken away from him and uh uh
[1:08:55] uh uh uh uh the priesthood was taken
[1:08:58] away from him and uh and the kingship
[1:09:03] It was taken away. The priesthood was
[1:09:05] given to Levi. Kingship was given to
[1:09:06] Judah. The breth was given to to Joseph.
[1:09:10] He lost it.
[1:09:14] Now that's that's under the Old
[1:09:16] Testament. So we see here uh New
[1:09:19] Testament Paul mention of a man doing
[1:09:23] the same thing sleeping with his
[1:09:24] father's wife. He said excommunicate
[1:09:26] that man from among us.
[1:09:30] He said those things must not be
[1:09:32] mentioned among us. Those things are
[1:09:35] mentioned in the word it must not be
[1:09:37] mentioned among us.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I I would tell you something. I would
[1:09:42] tell you I have seen how sin
[1:09:48] has ravaged
[1:09:53] church. Not only the church as a church
[1:09:56] but family
[1:10:01] it has ravaged family. It it it
[1:10:04] destroyed the lives of innocent children
[1:10:09] and before you realize it's just a a a
[1:10:12] complete abomination.
[1:10:15] And I and I would not be afraid to say
[1:10:18] those things are happening in our ranks.
[1:10:22] There are a lot of abuses
[1:10:26] that are happening in our ranks.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And I believe that by the grace of God,
[1:10:44] God has called us and expose us to a
[1:10:47] level of truth in his word to raise up
[1:10:50] the standard.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; When the enemy come as a flaw, God will
[1:10:54] raise up a standard. And you are the
[1:10:56] standard of God in this age.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; A people that can stand for truth, stand
[1:11:02] for decency.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Stand for righteousness. Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; We're not telling anybody that we better
[1:11:10] than anybody.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; We are only saying by the grace of God.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; We are respecting what God's word says.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Ananas, like I said, uh uh uh uh uh
[1:11:29] their uh uh uh Achan Joshua, he stole a
[1:11:34] Babylonian garment because because they
[1:11:37] never had a blood protection. The blood
[1:11:39] of bulls and goats could not protect him
[1:11:46] like the way the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:11:48] is protecting us.
[1:11:51] And that is the thing that that we the
[1:11:53] Gentiles
[1:11:55] are h are uh uh uh uh we are like Paul
[1:12:00] says in Hebrew, we are uh we we we are
[1:12:04] spitting in the face of the blood that
[1:12:06] was spilled for us. Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; I like the way he says it. Hebrew
[1:12:15] chapter 6. Let's let's go there a little
[1:12:16] bit. Let's go there a little bit. Like I
[1:12:19] said this this morning, you just got to
[1:12:20] bear with me. Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; You just got to bear with me. I I hope
[1:12:26] not to keep you long, but uh uh I'm
[1:12:30] setting setting the stage here because I
[1:12:33] will have to come back to this.
[1:12:40] If we don't pay attention to these
[1:12:42] things, uh it will be it will be a
[1:12:45] history that we will not want to we will
[1:12:48] not want to talk about. Amen.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; But if we pay attention to it and God
[1:12:54] gave us the grace to get back to to to
[1:12:58] to cleaning up our skirts and cleaning
[1:13:00] our lives, we will be proud
[1:13:04] that God help us in our generation.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:15] Paul will talk talk here. Uh uh
[1:13:29] he will speak here and says uh ver verse
[1:13:31] four. Let's read from verse four. For it
[1:13:34] is impossible for those for those who
[1:13:37] were once enlightened
[1:13:40] and they have tasted of the heavenly
[1:13:42] gifts
[1:13:44] and they were made partakers of the Holy
[1:13:46] Ghost. They rejoice in the world. Oh, it
[1:13:49] was a wonderful sermon. I felt the
[1:13:52] presence of God.
[1:13:55] They enjoy all of that.
[1:13:58] Amen.
[1:14:03] and have tasted the good word of God and
[1:14:07] the power of the word to come.
[1:14:11] That hope of a resurrection,
[1:14:14] that hope uh that gave you the desire to
[1:14:17] want to go in the rapture.
[1:14:20] You have tasted of the good of the word
[1:14:22] to come.
[1:14:24] He says, "If they shall fall away to
[1:14:27] renew them again unto repentance," this
[1:14:31] is this is the thing that caught my
[1:14:32] mind. Seeing the crucified to themsself,
[1:14:40] they crucified to themsel. They have got
[1:14:44] to the place where they have uh reduced
[1:14:47] the word of God that the fear of God is
[1:14:50] not in them. They can say anything about
[1:14:53] the word of God. They can do anything in
[1:14:55] their life. They have crucified to
[1:14:57] themsself.
[1:15:02] You cannot crucify Jesus the second time
[1:15:06] but you can crucify him to yourself in a
[1:15:09] sense that his word will never have
[1:15:12] effect in your life. Nobody no matter
[1:15:15] who say it to you.
[1:15:18] No matter who say it to you, it will
[1:15:19] never have it will not move you.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; You have crucified the word to yourself.
[1:15:28] You can never come to repentance. You
[1:15:30] can never regret. You don't have remorse
[1:15:32] for doing wrong.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; It don't break your heart that you know
[1:15:38] that there are things in the world you
[1:15:39] must not do.
[1:15:48] Are we together?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; And this and this is a dangerous place
[1:15:53] to get
[1:15:55] because you see God, he's he's the God
[1:15:59] of mercy. Amen.
[1:16:02] If you come to God and and repent and
[1:16:05] ask for forgiveness, he will forgive
[1:16:07] you. But if the desire is not in you to
[1:16:11] come,
[1:16:14] That's what happened in here.
[1:16:17] Amen. It's not that God will never
[1:16:19] forgive you, but you don't have the
[1:16:21] desire.
[1:16:23] You don't have the desire to be
[1:16:25] forgiven. You don't have the desire to
[1:16:27] repent because you have crucified the
[1:16:30] word to yourself.
[1:16:34] Nothing move you anymore.
[1:16:42] And that's a terrible place to get. King
[1:16:45] got to that place and the Bible says he
[1:16:47] wandered in the earth like a vakabone
[1:16:53] because he was not he was not even h no
[1:16:56] remorse in his heart and he's asking
[1:16:58] almighty God am I my brother's keeper?
[1:17:04] The thing that gave us the desire to
[1:17:08] persevere to to come to the house of
[1:17:10] God,
[1:17:12] that little thing in you, that little
[1:17:15] still small voice don't kill it.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Because you will not always have it.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; In the days of Noah, the Bible said the
[1:17:26] spirit of God will not strive with men
[1:17:28] anymore. Which mean God started dealing
[1:17:32] with their hearts.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; The reason why you can say you can pray
[1:17:40] for forgiveness, the reason why you can
[1:17:42] cry and say, "Oh God, help me. Oh God,
[1:17:45] help me." Is not because of your
[1:17:47] strength.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; It's because of that little thing.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; That God put in your heart.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; When it go away, there is no money that
[1:17:56] can give it to you. There is no church
[1:17:59] you can go to, you will get it.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; It never came by your natural birth. It
[1:18:03] came by the grace of God.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:31] See, they crucified to themselves the
[1:18:33] son of God aresh and put him to an open
[1:18:37] shame.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; You counting the blood nothing.
[1:18:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Counting the blood, the grace of God,
[1:18:47] nothing.
[1:18:51] In this very same letter, Paul says,
[1:18:53] "It's a fearful thing to fall in the
[1:18:56] hands of the living God."
[1:19:01] It's a scary thing
[1:19:05] to fall in the hands of living.
[1:19:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:13] Living in such a word, uh uh uh uh you
[1:19:16] know, you you you start to to to to
[1:19:18] preach these things and and hear these
[1:19:21] things and uh the age classify you,
[1:19:26] you know, classify you that you are
[1:19:28] running because you are not it's it's
[1:19:30] it's not appealing to the culture.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I was just I was I was
[1:19:36] just sharing something with uh every
[1:19:38] last night we were driving just talking
[1:19:40] fellowshipping trying to keep ourself
[1:19:41] awake. Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Trying to keep ourself awake. I never
[1:19:45] talk to two picss. Normally I will put
[1:19:46] toothpicks and keep my eyes open.
[1:19:53] I'm just joking.
[1:19:56] So, we're trying to keep ourel awake and
[1:19:58] we're just we're just just having a good
[1:20:00] time. And I told him, I says, I I was
[1:20:02] just thinking about this thing. You you
[1:20:04] just you just look at how how the the
[1:20:08] the modern culture is just swallowing us
[1:20:11] up.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; As soon as we see it, we want to do it.
[1:20:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; As soon as we see it, we want to do it.
[1:20:24] And I was I was this day I was just
[1:20:26] there. I was saying, "Oh God, we ever
[1:20:30] reach to the time
[1:20:33] where
[1:20:35] wearing
[1:20:37] trousers will be normalized for our
[1:20:40] sisters.
[1:20:43] Will we ever get to that time
[1:20:48] where we will we will we will we will
[1:20:50] come to a place where uh uh a sensor
[1:20:53] that yeah you know uh uh we let me tell
[1:20:56] you all
[1:20:58] the revival in the past that have got to
[1:21:01] that place they never knew that they
[1:21:04] would get there.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; They never knew that they would get
[1:21:09] there. They never knew how holiness
[1:21:12] would go away from them
[1:21:16] and they would become so worldly
[1:21:20] all because they want to appeal
[1:21:24] to the modern way of doing things. They
[1:21:28] want to be h have a popular exception to
[1:21:33] be accepted by the people.
[1:21:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:39] I thought about that and I says, "God
[1:21:42] forbid.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; God will have to shut it because he says
[1:21:49] this move of God will not be
[1:21:50] denominated."
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; He will have to shut it.
[1:21:57] He will have to shut it.
[1:22:02] But yet those are things that are
[1:22:04] creeping into our rings.
[1:22:08] They are creeping into our ranks.
[1:22:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:17] The same way uh many years ago, the way
[1:22:21] family life, oh my god,
[1:22:25] you find people that were praying,
[1:22:27] praying for the Holy Ghost and fasting
[1:22:29] and praying and and they love one
[1:22:32] another, but they just felt like they
[1:22:34] were not ready to get married because
[1:22:35] they felt they did not have the Holy
[1:22:37] Ghost.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I know the couple like that.
[1:22:41] They stay many years because the brother
[1:22:43] was not convinced he had the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:46] Well, anyway, it was the way he was
[1:22:48] taught. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; So, let me just leave that one. That's a
[1:22:52] different story. But the thing about it
[1:22:54] there is they are the uh uh but those
[1:22:57] things are no longer like that. They are
[1:23:00] no longer we have we have uh uh uh we we
[1:23:03] we have Facebook wedding, Tik Tok
[1:23:05] wedding.
[1:23:09] Yeah,
[1:23:11] we have all of those things.
[1:23:20] A situation was brought brought before
[1:23:22] me a couple of months ago when and uh h
[1:23:25] a brother backslided
[1:23:28] not serving God
[1:23:31] ruin churches ran around the sisters.
[1:23:38] Mary left his wife travel got on on the
[1:23:40] internet talking to her sister in a
[1:23:42] different country went there
[1:23:46] and the brothers never even had the
[1:23:48] grace to say let's look at this that
[1:23:50] found this man background
[1:23:52] he has a wife that he has left and he
[1:23:55] went and got married to a young virgin
[1:23:58] girl
[1:24:01] that that Malaku I'm telling you people
[1:24:03] about I'm not talking about Lutheran
[1:24:19] that you you will do a wedding and will
[1:24:21] not even know where this guy is coming
[1:24:23] from
[1:24:30] because he came from Dubai.
[1:24:36] Praise the Lord. No, it's true. He came
[1:24:38] from Dubai.
[1:24:41] So, it's an opportunity now. Our our
[1:24:43] daughter, our precious sister coming to
[1:24:45] go overseas.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:06] You love the Lord.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; See, because we get so so in a place
[1:25:20] where we get intimidated when it looks
[1:25:23] like our church is a small church. So it
[1:25:26] looks like we must leave those things.
[1:25:27] So, so the church can grow.
[1:25:33] In as in the book of Acts,
[1:25:38] Jesus talked about the parable of the
[1:25:41] living.
[1:25:44] That was fulfilled in the in the New
[1:25:47] Testament church
[1:25:50] when the Bible talks about the 3,000
[1:25:53] souls that were saved.
[1:25:56] That was how mixed multitude came in the
[1:25:58] church.
[1:26:03] That was how mixed multitude came in the
[1:26:05] church.
[1:26:06] Ananas and Sophara, they were all part
[1:26:08] of that 3,000 that were saved.
[1:26:17] Are we together?
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not I hope you know that I'm not mad
[1:26:22] with you. Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; And you know that.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm not mad. It's just that uh uh
[1:26:30] I'm I'm tired. If I'm sounding angry,
[1:26:32] it's because I'm tired. I'm not mad.
[1:26:34] Truth. I'm I'm not mad with you. It's
[1:26:36] just that uh uh that's that's what I had
[1:26:40] on my heart. You see me? I'm not even
[1:26:41] reading quotes because I'm just trying
[1:26:44] to to run you through, give you the
[1:26:46] picture of what I wanted to talk about
[1:26:47] this morning.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not mad with you. I'm mad
[1:26:54] with the devil. Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Now, with the devil and I'm I'm trying
[1:26:59] to say to you that we we have to we have
[1:27:01] to wake up from the dust.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; We have to wake up from the dust.
[1:27:11] You know, I just love it because our
[1:27:13] Lord Jesus make it so simple. He said
[1:27:16] whereever two or three, he make the
[1:27:19] church so simple
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; that we don't have to be intimidated if
[1:27:23] we are a small group. If that what it
[1:27:25] would takes for us to stand for the word
[1:27:28] of God, then let it take it.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Then let it take it.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Because what what is what is the need of
[1:27:38] wanting to get get a a a big church and
[1:27:41] before we realize our young children are
[1:27:44] defied?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; What is the need of that?
[1:27:57] that we don't have word that can bring
[1:27:58] them to their knees and bring them to to
[1:28:00] to repentance and and and and and and
[1:28:04] the fear of God in their heart.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; We just come and and and preach
[1:28:09] something and make everybody laugh and
[1:28:10] and let's clap for Jesus. Let's sing,
[1:28:13] hit the music, let's dance, let's
[1:28:14] worship the Lord, and then let's go
[1:28:16] home.
[1:28:18] How are we getting oursel ready for the
[1:28:19] rapture?
[1:28:32] Are we together? Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I tell you, every every organization,
[1:28:40] every organization I was just looking at
[1:28:42] looking at a documentary just just uh
[1:28:45] right right here the uh I think it was a
[1:28:47] kind of a 19 30 something documentary uh
[1:28:51] of of New York City. And the thing that
[1:28:53] caught my eyes was you could not find
[1:28:56] one lady
[1:28:58] with trousers on.
[1:29:01] They were not Christians. They were just
[1:29:03] New York City.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; How come it's it's gone from us
[1:29:23] now? When you dress decent as a lady,
[1:29:25] you then you look like, "Oh, wow. Where
[1:29:27] she's coming from?" It looks like she's
[1:29:29] coming. And is is it the thing that will
[1:29:32] intimidate you?
[1:29:34] Don't you realize the grace that God has
[1:29:36] put on you?
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That in such an evil and adulterous age,
[1:29:41] you have the grace and courage to dress
[1:29:42] like a lady.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; You must be proud. You must put your
[1:29:46] face up.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:01] family life was was uh was uh uh was
[1:30:05] cherished. They never had they never had
[1:30:07] I mean people were working for 35 cents
[1:30:10] an hour.
[1:30:13] They just how little but the I mean
[1:30:16] family life was so important. They
[1:30:18] cherish it. They spend time together.
[1:30:20] They they were happy.
[1:30:26] They have they have more children. They
[1:30:28] have more children. They didn't have
[1:30:29] money. They just have many children. But
[1:30:30] they were still happy.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Now we don't want many children. We just
[1:30:34] want one or two. And we get crisis.
[1:30:43] It's a reality.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; What has gone wrong?
[1:30:50] Why can't we see that that that that
[1:30:52] this is a destructive spirit?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Why would we want to go through the
[1:31:01] emotion of you know sharing our emotion?
[1:31:05] Oh, you know, I I like you. Oh, I love
[1:31:07] you. I mean, we we do all of that and
[1:31:10] then when they put us in the house, we
[1:31:12] don't want to be in the house anymore.
[1:31:16] We don't want to be in the house. The
[1:31:17] only thing we want we want is ceremony.
[1:31:19] Everybody come, we mar down, they put us
[1:31:21] in the house. Okay, y'all live together.
[1:31:23] We don't want it.
[1:31:25] What has gone wrong?
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; It must be for them, not for us.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; We have something that can keep us
[1:31:36] together.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; We have something that can settle our
[1:31:39] differences. Is the word of God.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. is the word of God and prayers.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Our commitment to God, our devotion to
[1:31:50] God's word.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm not mad at you.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Say, "Daddy, why are you yelling?"
[1:32:18] I say, "I'm not."
[1:32:21] Amen. So, I'm not yelling.
[1:32:24] So, so that that was what I was going to
[1:32:26] go down with you this morning on church
[1:32:28] discipline. We'll pick it up from there
[1:32:30] and uh uh we'll pick it up by God's
[1:32:33] grace and and really get into it, study
[1:32:36] it together and realize that it's for
[1:32:39] our protection.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; It's for our protection.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; If you remember many many many years ago
[1:32:49] or a few years ago, not many few years
[1:32:52] ago, it should be uh maybe two years or
[1:32:54] three years ago, I preached on a series
[1:32:56] called the bounding power. And what I
[1:32:58] took was where Jesus said, "Whatever you
[1:33:01] bound on earth, I will bound in heaven.
[1:33:03] Whatever you lose on earth, I will lose
[1:33:05] in heaven." And brother Brandham
[1:33:07] somewhere said the church is losing its
[1:33:09] bounding power.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; We are losing our b. There is something
[1:33:14] that keep us together.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; There is something that keep the church.
[1:33:19] the church as much as the last just few
[1:33:23] time we talk about you know uh uh uh
[1:33:25] trying to go into uh uh uh financial
[1:33:28] contribution to build a church and all
[1:33:30] that that that is beautiful we pray that
[1:33:32] the Lord will be able to to help us to
[1:33:35] achieve that
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; but I'm telling you if we don't have
[1:33:38] what keep the church together
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; it will be difficult to achieve that
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; because pretty soon we will come right
[1:33:46] back to Ananas and Safia and and and
[1:33:49] then money problem now we be in the
[1:33:51] house between husband and wife you know
[1:33:53] we get enough money and and you know it
[1:33:56] is not we alone that's supposed to build
[1:33:57] a church and then uh but if the bounding
[1:34:00] power is there if we see the value of of
[1:34:03] the life of Christ we see the value of
[1:34:06] of of uh of of uh h building a memorial
[1:34:10] and and and having a place where we can
[1:34:13] labor together as h as you know uh
[1:34:16] brothers and sisters and strive
[1:34:19] uh uh for righteousness and truth. Lift
[1:34:21] up the bonnet of Malachi 4. Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; If you go back in the book of Exodus,
[1:34:29] you will realize the Bible talks about
[1:34:32] uh uh Moses building the tabernacle and
[1:34:35] how God pulled the spirit of willingness
[1:34:37] upon the people.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of willingness that
[1:34:41] build the tabernacle
[1:34:44] because they were in the wilderness.
[1:34:45] What do they have?
[1:34:48] It's just the things that the Egyptian
[1:34:49] gives them when they were traveling, but
[1:34:51] a spirit of willingness was upon the
[1:34:53] people.
[1:34:55] Praise the Lord. Now, so so you see uh
[1:34:59] uh uh uh and and that's what the church
[1:35:02] hates. you study the message you will
[1:35:04] see how brother Brandham when he use
[1:35:07] when he talks about bonding on earth and
[1:35:09] bonding he use it more in a prayer line
[1:35:14] challenging Satan
[1:35:16] that the word said wherever we bound on
[1:35:19] earth so he was bounding he was using
[1:35:21] the bounding power to keep God's
[1:35:23] children in good health
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; and keep sickness outside
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; the church can use the bounding power to
[1:35:31] keep the word inside and keep sin
[1:35:34] outside.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; That's what the bounding power is
[1:35:38] getting for.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; It's only used on an individual. If he
[1:35:49] does not want to reconcile with the word
[1:35:51] or she does not want to reconcile with
[1:35:53] the word, that's that's when that is
[1:35:55] you. Then then the church use that
[1:35:57] authority to keep you outside.
[1:36:01] But it's it was it's not for the people.
[1:36:04] It's for the spirit.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; The bounding power is to keep the devil
[1:36:09] out of our lives, out of our home, out
[1:36:12] of the church.
[1:36:20] Are we together?
[1:36:24] So, uh,
[1:36:29] it's a beautiful thing.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. And, uh, I pray
[1:36:37] that the Lord will be able to help each
[1:36:40] and every one of us. Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; To be able to help each and every one of
[1:36:46] us.
[1:36:49] uh many of us we can we can tell our
[1:36:53] testimony how we came to the lord how
[1:36:55] the grace of god has help us in in uh in
[1:36:58] many different situation but there we
[1:37:00] have we have children that are being
[1:37:02] born have young people that are growing
[1:37:05] up
[1:37:06] and if there's a tomorrow
[1:37:11] those are the ones that we must strive
[1:37:12] for
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; that will give us an atmosphere that
[1:37:17] will bring our children to birth. It
[1:37:19] will bring our children to repentance.
[1:37:22] The the the the language I was born in
[1:37:25] the message will not be their language.
[1:37:27] Their language will be I'm born again. I
[1:37:30] have the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Because born in the message does not
[1:37:33] work.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; It's a deceitful slogan.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; All my children are born in the message.
[1:37:42] So what?
[1:37:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; We have a generation
[1:37:57] a a
[1:38:00] an evil generation a a power that is in
[1:38:03] this age.
[1:38:10] I mean that is just that is just that
[1:38:12] that is just consum consuming the young
[1:38:15] people.
[1:38:20] Young this generation is a is a is a
[1:38:23] addict generation.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Young people are just addicted to
[1:38:28] different things.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; All different form of addiction.
[1:38:39] Science even tell looking at a
[1:38:41] documentary even they have they even did
[1:38:43] it with even in some of the the little
[1:38:46] babies cartoon and it tells how how it
[1:38:49] works on their brain
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; because of some of the way they they do
[1:38:55] the things so fast
[1:38:59] trying to get the kids when they are
[1:39:01] even babies. Is that not what Pharaoh
[1:39:03] said?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:07] from two years old down killed it.
[1:39:11] And that's that's what this spirit is
[1:39:13] doing in our age.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; You see the church supposed to be the
[1:39:25] place where we come to strengthen one
[1:39:28] another.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; When we bring our prayer request, it
[1:39:32] will not be a joking thing. People will
[1:39:35] get down on their knees and desperate
[1:39:37] and cry to God and say, "Oh, help our
[1:39:39] brother. Lord, help our sister."
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Because we know it's a serious thing out
[1:39:44] there.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Well, if we make the church just a
[1:39:56] social gathering,
[1:39:59] we come whenever time we can come. You
[1:40:00] can't even follow. There is no way you
[1:40:02] can even trace the sequence of what is
[1:40:04] happening in church. What was preached
[1:40:06] last week? How how does it connect to
[1:40:07] what is preached today or what is
[1:40:09] preached on Wednesday night? Let's see
[1:40:11] how the Holy Ghost is dealing. You can't
[1:40:12] even connect that
[1:40:18] because the church is just a place we go
[1:40:20] when we feel like going.
[1:40:33] We not treat our body like that. We we
[1:40:36] put ourself on diet. We wash our food.
[1:40:38] We ate and all of that. But when it
[1:40:40] comes to our soul,
[1:40:42] we just open it up for anything
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; and everything.
[1:40:47] May God give us grace. Amen.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; My hands are up before yours. Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's the time that we have. We
[1:40:57] have a responsibility.
[1:41:00] We have a responsibility. When Jesus
[1:41:02] says, "I will build my church and the
[1:41:04] gates of hell will not uh h
[1:41:08] prevailed against it." The church was
[1:41:11] placed here to represent God on earth.
[1:41:18] That's the reason why Paul was told
[1:41:20] Jesus said, "Why persecute thou me?"
[1:41:25] He never met Jesus. But Jesus said,
[1:41:28] "Paul saw why persecute thou me?"
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; He will come to the understanding that
[1:41:37] he was persecuting Jesus by destroying
[1:41:39] the church.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; He will come to that understanding
[1:41:47] as God will start dealing with him. And
[1:41:50] because of that when when he got that
[1:41:52] revelation that thing ate that man up so
[1:41:55] much that Paul he he he he denied
[1:41:59] himself to get married.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; The death of Stephen and many of the
[1:42:04] other apostle haunted him until he
[1:42:06] wanted to die for the very thing that he
[1:42:08] was trying to destroy.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Say I'm not afraid to go to Rome. I'm
[1:42:13] ready to give my life. I fought a good
[1:42:16] fight.
[1:42:23] I hope we are we we we we can take that
[1:42:26] courage to be able to give our life for
[1:42:30] the thing that has saved us.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; if it was not because of this message of
[1:42:37] the hour, some of us, we will be
[1:42:39] horrible.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; We will be horrible. We'll be we'll be
[1:42:44] having chains all around every part of
[1:42:46] our body. from our toes. Our toes will
[1:42:49] get ring,
[1:42:51] ankle bracelet, knee bracelets
[1:42:57] will get pierced all over our body
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; if it was not if it is not because God
[1:43:02] touch our heart.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Better give your life for the thing that
[1:43:12] save you
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; because there's a price to pay.
[1:43:19] There's a price to pay.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. This afternoon,
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I just want us to go to go to the Lord
[1:43:27] and pray as we talk about these things.
[1:43:31] We have dealt with spirits. We have
[1:43:33] exposed spirits. I'm not coming against
[1:43:35] no individual. I'm dealing with spirits

[1:43:51] feeling the attack of the enemy.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; This mean standing in the need of
[1:44:06] prayer. Just lower the volume more. Let
[1:44:10] me let me hear the people singing and
[1:44:12] praying a little bit. Just just keep it
[1:44:14] right in the middle of it.

[1:56:10] has it been
[1:56:13] since you tal

[1:57:40] hands, dear Lord. Precious Lord, take my
[1:57:43] hands. Let's sing that one. I think we
[1:57:45] both we can all sing that one.
[1:57:51] Lead me all.
[1:57:54] Let me stay. Oh,
[1:57:58] I am tired.
[1:58:01] Lord, I'm weak
[1:58:04] and I'm w
[1:58:10] through this storm.
[1:58:13] through the night.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Lead me on to the rock.
[1:58:22] Take my hand,
[1:58:25] precious Lord.
[1:58:32] Just play softly there.
[1:58:35] You can see you can see how
[1:58:38] how backsliding many of us are
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; even to gear into pray
[1:58:46] to enter into prayer to commune with
[1:58:48] God. We don't even know where to start
[1:58:50] from.
[1:58:53] We are lo we are losing touch. We are
[1:58:57] losing touch with our maker.
[1:59:00] We are losing touch. We are allowing
[1:59:02] things to abuse our hearts and abuse our
[1:59:05] mind
[1:59:14] [Music]
[1:59:17] that an opportunity to speak to God with
[1:59:19] just sitting there. You don't even know
[1:59:20] where to start from.
[1:59:23] You so conscious of around you and where
[1:59:25] the next place you have to go and the
[1:59:27] time and all of that that you cannot
[1:59:29] even enter in.
[1:59:32] You can't we can't even enter in and
[1:59:34] say, "Lord, thank you. Thank you for
[1:59:36] touching my heart. Lord, don't don't
[1:59:38] take your spirit away from me.
[1:59:51] [Music]
[1:59:56] Everyone is going through one storm or
[1:59:59] the other.
[2:00:03] But where is our reality?
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Where is our reality? Why? Why come to
[2:00:10] church and we and we can't speak to the
[2:00:11] one that we have come to?
[2:00:16] We are not on speaking terms with God.
[2:00:21] We can spend hours on the phone talking
[2:00:23] the thing that concern us and not
[2:00:25] concern us, the gossip and everything,
[2:00:27] but we can't even spend time to talk to
[2:00:30] our maker.
[2:00:34] [Music]
[2:00:54] Where is the where is the spirit of God?
[2:00:59] It used to be where the power of God
[2:01:01] will fall upon the people. They would be
[2:01:03] crying for their children. Oh God, save
[2:01:05] my children. Lord, help my loved ones.
[2:01:08] Father God, oh Lord, help this family.
[2:01:11] and and they will be so moved.
[2:01:15] But we set ourselves to say we just from
[2:01:17] watching a movie
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:26] and we having taints in our hearts
[2:01:28] against people, tainting our hearts and
[2:01:30] our mind.
[2:01:45] Where is the country heart? Where is the
[2:01:46] broken heart?
[2:01:50] Where is the broken heart?
[2:01:53] Where are the womens of lamentation?
[2:01:56] Where's the church of lamentation?
[2:02:00] Word of people knows how to just place
[2:02:03] themselves before God and say, "Lord,
[2:02:05] let my tears tell you everything. I
[2:02:08] don't have words. Let my tears say it
[2:02:10] all to you." Where's the church of
[2:02:12] lamentation?
[2:02:21] Our heart has become so hard that no
[2:02:25] matter how God tried to squeeze our
[2:02:27] heart, he cannot get a juice out of our
[2:02:30] eyes.
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:43] Yes Lord, please Father,
[2:02:47] precious Lord,
[2:02:51] take my hands,
[2:02:54] lead me, oh,
[2:02:57] please let me stand.
[2:03:00] Father, I'm tired.
[2:03:04] I am weak.
[2:03:07] I am
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; through my storm,
[2:03:16] through the night.
