[4:08] desired him that he would show them a
[4:10] sign from heaven
[4:11] he answered and said unto them
[4:13] when it is evening ye say it will be
[4:15] fair weather for the sky is red and in
[4:18] the morning it will be foul weather
[4:19] today for the sky is red and lowering
[4:22] o ye hypocrites ye can discern the face
[4:25] of the sky but can ye not discern the
[4:28] signs of the times
[4:29] a wicked and adulterous generation
[4:31] seeketh after a sign and there shall no
[4:33] sign be given unto it but the sign of
[4:35] the prophet jonas
[4:37] and he left them and departed
[4:40] and when his disciples were come to the
[4:41] other side they had forgotten to take
[4:44] bread
[4:45] then jesus said unto them
[4:47] take heed and beware of the leaven of
[4:49] the pharisees and of the sadducees
[4:52] and they reasoned among themselves
[4:53] saying
[4:54] it is because we have taken no bread
[4:56] which when jesus perceived he said unto
[4:58] them oh ye of little faith
[5:01] why reason ye among yourselves because
[5:03] ye have brought no bread do ye not yet
[5:05] understand neither remember the five
[5:07] loaves of the five thousand and how many
[5:09] baskets he took up neither the seven
[5:12] loaves of the four thousand and how many
[5:14] baskets he took up
[5:15] how is it that you do not understand
[5:18] that i spake it not to you concerning
[5:19] bread that you should beware of the
[5:21] leaven of the pharisees and of the
[5:22] sadducees
[5:24] then understood they how that he bad
[5:26] them not beware of the leaven of bread
[5:29] but of the doctrine of the pharisees and
[5:31] of the sadducees
[5:34] when jesus came into the coasts of
[5:36] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[5:38] saying whom do men say that i the son of
[5:41] man ham
[5:43] and they said
[5:44] some say that thou art john the baptist
[5:46] some elias and others jeremiah's or one
[5:49] of the prophets
[5:51] he saith unto them
[5:53] but whom say ye that i am
[5:55] and simon peter answered and said thou
[5:58] art the christ the son of the living god
[6:01] and jesus answered and said unto him
[6:03] blessed art thou simon barjona
[6:06] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[6:08] unto thee but my father which is in
[6:10] heaven
[6:11] and i say also unto thee that thou art
[6:13] peter
[6:14] and upon this rock i will build my
[6:17] church
[6:18] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[6:20] against it
[6:22] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[6:23] the kingdom of heaven
[6:25] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[6:27] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[6:29] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[6:31] loosed in heaven
[6:33] then charged he his disciples that they
[6:35] should tell no man that he was jesus the
[6:37] christ
[6:40] from that time forth began jesus to show
[6:42] unto his disciples how that he must go
[6:44] into jerusalem and suffer many things of
[6:47] the elders and chief priests and scribes
[6:50] and be killed and be raised again the
[6:52] third day
[6:54] then peter took him and began to rebuke
[6:56] him saying be it far from thee lord this
[6:59] shall not be unto thee
[7:01] but he turned and said unto peter
[7:04] get thee behind me satan
[7:07] thou art an offence unto me
[7:09] for thou savorist not the things that be
[7:11] of god
[7:12] but those that be of men
[7:15] then said jesus unto his disciples
[7:18] if any man will come after me let him
[7:20] deny himself and take up his cross and
[7:22] follow me for whosoever will save his
[7:24] life shall lose it
[7:26] and whosoever will lose his life for my
[7:28] sake shall find it
[7:30] for what is a man profited if he shall
[7:32] gain the whole world and lose his own
[7:34] soul
[7:35] or what shall a man give in exchange for
[7:37] his soul
[7:38] for the son of man shall come in the
[7:40] glory of his father with his angels and
[7:42] then he shall reward every man according
[7:44] to his works
[7:46] verily i say unto you
[7:48] there be some standing here
[7:50] which shall not taste of death till they
[7:53] see the son of man coming in his kingdom
[7:57] and after six days jesus taketh peter
[8:00] james and john his brother and bringeth
[8:02] them up into an high mountain apart and
[8:04] was transfigured before them
[8:06] and his face did shine as the sun and
[8:09] his raiment was white as the light
[8:12] and behold there appeared unto them
[8:14] moses and elias talking with him
[8:17] then answered peter and said unto jesus
[8:20] lord it is good for us to be here
[8:23] if thou wilt
[8:24] let us make here three tabernacles one
[8:27] for thee and one for moses and one for
[8:29] elias
[8:30] while he yet spake behold a bright cloud
[8:33] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[8:35] of the cloud which said this is my
[8:37] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[8:40] hear ye him
[8:41] and when the disciples heard it they
[8:43] fell on their face and was sore afraid
[8:46] and jesus came and touched them and said
[8:48] arise and be not afraid
[8:50] and when they had lifted up their eyes
[8:53] they saw no man
[8:54] save jesus only
[8:57] and as they came down from the mountain
[8:59] jesus charged them saying tell the
[9:01] vision to no man
[9:03] until the son of man be risen again from
[9:05] the
[9:06] dead and his disciples asked him saying
[9:10] why then say the scribes that elias must
[9:12] first come
[9:14] and jesus answered and said unto them
[9:16] elias truly shall first come and restore
[9:19] all things but i say unto you that elias
[9:22] is come already
[9:24] and they knew him not but have done unto
[9:26] him whatsoever they listed
[9:28] likewise shall also the son of man
[9:29] suffer of them
[9:31] and the disciples understood that he
[9:33] spake unto them of john the baptist
[9:37] and when they were come to the multitude
[9:38] there came to him a certain man kneeling
[9:41] down to him and saying
[9:43] lord have mercy on my son for he is
[9:45] lunatic and so vexed
[9:47] for oft times he falleth into the fire
[9:49] and often to the water
[9:51] and i brought him to thy disciples and
[9:52] they could not cure him
[9:55] then jesus answered and said
[9:57] o faithless and perverse generation how
[9:59] long shall i be with you
[10:01] how long shall i suffer you bring him
[10:04] hither to me
[10:05] and jesus rebuked the devil and he
[10:08] departed out of him and the child was
[10:10] cured from that very hour
[10:12] then came the disciples to jesus apart
[10:15] and said why could not we cast him out
[10:18] and jesus said unto them
[10:20] because of your unbelief
[10:23] for verily i say unto you if ye have
[10:25] faith as a grain of mustard seed he
[10:27] shall say unto this mountain remove
[10:29] hence to yonder place and it shall
[10:32] remove
[10:33] and nothing shall be impossible unto you
[10:36] howbeit
[10:37] this kind goeth not out but by prayer
[10:40] and fasting
[10:43] and while they abode in galilee jesus
[10:45] said unto them
[10:46] the son of man shall be betrayed into
[10:48] the hands of men
[10:50] and they shall kill him and the third
[10:52] day he shall be raised again
[10:55] and they were exceeding sorry
[10:58] and when they will come to capernaum
[10:59] they that receive tribute money came to
[11:01] peter and said doth not your master pay
[11:04] tribute
[11:05] he said yes
[11:07] and when he was come into the house
[11:09] jesus prevented him saying
[11:10] what think is thou simon
[11:13] of whom do the kings of the earth take
[11:14] custom or tribute of their own children
[11:17] or of strangers
[11:19] peter saith unto him of strangers
[11:22] jesus saith unto him
[11:24] then are the children free
[11:26] notwithstanding lest we should offend
[11:29] them go thou to the sea
[11:31] and cast and hook
[11:32] and take up the fish that first cometh
[11:34] up
[11:35] and when thou hast opened his mouth i
[11:37] shall find a piece of money
[11:39] that take and give unto them for me and
[11:41] thee
[11:43] at the same time came the disciples unto
[11:45] jesus saying who is the greatest in the
[11:47] kingdom of heaven
[11:49] and jesus called a little child unto him
[11:51] and set him in the midst of them and
[11:52] said verily i say unto you
[11:55] except ye be converted and become as
[11:58] little children you shall not enter into
[12:00] the kingdom of heaven
[12:02] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[12:04] as this little child
[12:06] the same is greatest in the kingdom of
[12:08] heaven
[12:09] and whoso shall receive one such little
[12:12] child in my name receiveth me
[12:15] but whoso shall offend one of these
[12:17] little ones which believe in me
[12:19] it were better for him that a millstone
[12:21] were hanged about his neck and that he
[12:23] would drowned in the depth of the sea
[12:26] woe unto the world because of offenses
[12:29] for it must needs be that offenses come
[12:32] but woe to that man by whom the offense
[12:34] cometh
[12:36] wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend
[12:38] thee cut them off and cast them from
[12:40] thee
[12:41] it is better for thee to enter into life
[12:43] halt or maimed rather than having two
[12:45] hands or two feet to be cast into
[12:47] everlasting fire
[12:49] and if thine eye offend thee pluck it
[12:51] out and cast it from thee it is better
[12:53] for thee to enter into life with one eye
[12:55] rather than having two eyes to be cast
[12:57] into hellfire
[13:00] take heed that ye despise not one of
[13:02] these little ones
[13:04] for i say unto you that in heaven their
[13:07] angels do always behold the face of my
[13:09] father which is in heaven
[13:12] for the son of man
[13:14] is come to save that which was lost
[13:18] how seeky if a man have a hundred sheep
[13:22] and one of them be gone astray does he
[13:24] not leave the 90 and nine and goeth into
[13:26] the mountains and seeketh that which has
[13:28] gone astray
[13:30] and if so be that he find it verily i
[13:32] say unto you he rejoiceth more of that
[13:34] sheep
[13:35] than of the nineteenth nine which went
[13:37] not astray
[13:39] even so it is not the will of your
[13:41] father which is in heaven that one of
[13:42] these little ones should perish
[13:46] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[13:48] against thee
[13:49] go and tell him his fault between thee
[13:51] and him alone
[13:53] if he shall hear thee
[13:54] thou hast gained thy brother
[13:57] but if he will not hear thee then take
[13:59] with thee one or two more that in the
[14:01] mouth of two or three witnesses every
[14:03] word may be established
[14:05] and if he shall neglect to hear them
[14:07] tell it unto the church
[14:09] but if you neglect to hear the church
[14:11] let him be unto thee as an heathen man
[14:13] and a publican
[14:15] verily i say unto you whatsoever ye
[14:17] shall bind on earth shall be bound in
[14:19] heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on
[14:21] earth shall be loosed in heaven
[14:24] again i say unto you
[14:26] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[14:28] as touching anything that they shall ask
[14:31] it shall be done for them of my father
[14:33] which is in heaven
[14:35] for where two or three are gathered
[14:37] together in my name
[14:39] there am i in the midst of them
[14:43] then came peter to him and said lord
[14:45] how oft shall my brother sin against me
[14:48] and i forgive him till seven times
[14:52] jesus saith unto him
[14:54] i say not unto thee until seven times
[14:57] but until seventy times seven
[15:00] therefore is the kingdom of heaven
[15:01] likened unto a certain king which would
[15:04] take account of his servants
[15:06] and when he had begun to reckon one was
[15:08] brought unto him which owed him ten
[15:09] thousand talents
[15:11] but for as much as he had not to pay his
[15:13] lord commanded him to be sold and his
[15:16] wife and children and all that he had
[15:18] and payment to be made
[15:20] the servant therefore fell down and
[15:21] worshipped him saying lord have patience
[15:23] with me and i will pay thee all
[15:26] then the lord of that servant was moved
[15:27] with compassion and loosed him and
[15:29] forgave him the debt
[15:31] but the same servant went out and found
[15:33] one of his fellow servants which owed
[15:35] him a hundred pants
[15:37] and he laid hands on him and took him by
[15:40] the throat saying pay me that bowelist
[15:43] and his fellow servant fell down at his
[15:44] feet and besought him saying have
[15:46] patience with me and i will pay thee all
[15:48] and he would not but went and cast him
[15:50] into prison till he should pay the debt
[15:54] so when his fellow servants saw what was
[15:56] done they were very sorry and came
[15:58] untold unto their lord all that was done
[16:01] then his lord after that he had called
[16:03] him said unto him
[16:05] o wicked servant
[16:07] i forgave thee all that debt because
[16:09] thou desiredst me should hast not thou
[16:12] also have had compassion on thy fellow
[16:14] servant even as i had pity on thee
[16:17] and his lord was roth and delivered him
[16:20] to the tormentors till he should pay all
[16:22] that was due unto him
[16:24] so likewise shall my heavenly father do
[16:27] also unto you
[16:29] if ye from your hearts forgive not
[16:31] everyone his brother their trespasses
[16:35] and it came to pass that when jesus had
[16:37] finished these sayings he departed from
[16:39] galilee and came into the coasts of
[16:40] judea beyond jordan and great multitudes
[16:44] followed him and he healed them there
[16:46] the pharisees also came unto him
[16:48] tempting him and saying unto him
[16:50] is it lawful for a man to put away his
[16:53] wife for every cause
[16:55] and he answered and said unto them
[16:58] have ye not read that he which made them
[17:00] at the beginning made them male and
[17:02] female and said for this cause shall a
[17:04] man leave father and mother and shall
[17:06] cleave to his wife and they twain shall
[17:08] be one flesh
[17:10] wherefore they are no more twain but one
[17:13] flesh
[17:14] what therefore god hath joined together
[17:17] let not man put asunder
[17:20] they say unto him why did moses then
[17:22] command to give a writing of divorcement
[17:23] and to put her away
[17:25] he saith unto them
[17:27] moses because of the hardness of your
[17:29] hearts suffered you to put away your
[17:31] wives
[17:32] but from the beginning it was not so
[17:35] and i say unto you whosoever shall put
[17:37] away his wife except it be for
[17:39] fornication and shall marry another
[17:41] committeth adultery and whoso marrieth
[17:44] her which is put away doth commit
[17:45] adultery
[17:48] his disciples say unto him
[17:50] if the case of the man be so with his
[17:52] wife it is not good to marry
[17:55] but he said unto them
[17:57] all men cannot receive this saying save
[18:00] they to whom it is given
[18:02] for there are some eunuchs which were so
[18:04] born from their mother's womb
[18:06] and there are some eunuchs which were
[18:07] made eunuchs of men
[18:09] and there be eunuchs which have made
[18:11] themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
[18:12] heaven's sake
[18:14] he that is able to receive it let him
[18:16] receive it
[18:18] then with there brought unto him little
[18:20] children that he should put his hands on
[18:22] them and pray
[18:23] and the disciples rebuked them but jesus
[18:26] said suffer little children and forbid
[18:28] them not to come unto me
[18:30] for of such is the kingdom of heaven
[18:33] and he laid his hands on them and
[18:34] departed thence
[18:37] and behold one came and said unto him
[18:39] good master what good thing shall i do
[18:41] that i may have eternal life
[18:43] and he said unto him
[18:45] why callest thou me good
[18:48] there is none good but one that is god
[18:52] but if thou wilt enter into life keep
[18:54] the commandments he saith unto him which
[18:58] jesus said
[19:00] thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not
[19:02] commit adultery thou shalt not steal
[19:05] thou shalt not bear false witness
[19:07] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[19:11] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[19:14] the young man set unto him
[19:16] all these things have i kept from my
[19:18] youth up what lack i yet
[19:21] jesus said unto him
[19:23] if i will be perfect
[19:26] go and sell that thou hast and give to
[19:28] the poor
[19:29] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[19:32] and come and follow me
[19:36] but when the young man heard that saying
[19:38] he went away sorrowful
[19:40] for he had great possessions
[19:43] then said jesus unto his disciples
[19:46] verily i say unto you that a rich man
[19:48] shall hardly enter into the kingdom of
[19:50] heaven and again i say unto you it is
[19:53] easier for a camel to go through the eye
[19:56] of a needle
[19:57] than for a rich man to enter into the
[19:59] kingdom of god
[20:01] when his disciples heard it they were
[20:02] exceedingly amazed saying who then can
[20:05] be saved
[20:07] but jesus beheld them and said unto them
[20:10] with men this is impossible
[20:12] but with god
[20:14] all things are possible
[20:16] then answered peter and said unto him
[20:18] behold we have forsaken all and followed
[20:20] thee what shall we have therefore
[20:23] and jesus said unto them
[20:24] verily i say unto you that ye which have
[20:27] followed me in the regeneration when the
[20:29] son of man shall sit in the throne of
[20:30] his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve
[20:33] thrones judging the twelve tribes of
[20:35] israel
[20:36] and everyone that hath forsaken houses
[20:38] or brethren or sisters or father or
[20:41] mother or wife or children
[20:44] or lands for my name's sake
[20:46] shall receive a hundred-fold and shall
[20:49] inherit everlasting life
[20:52] but many that are first shall be last
[20:55] and the last shall be first
[20:58] for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
[21:00] man that is an householder which went
[21:02] out early in the morning to hire
[21:03] laborers into his vineyard
[21:05] and when he had agreed with the laborers
[21:07] for a penny a day he sent them into his
[21:09] vineyard
[21:10] and he went out about the third hour and
[21:12] saw others standing idle in the
[21:14] marketplace and said unto them go ye
[21:16] also into the vineyard and whatsoever is
[21:18] right i will give you and they went
[21:20] their way
[21:21] again he went out about the sixth and
[21:23] ninth hour and did likewise
[21:26] and about the eleventh hour he went out
[21:28] and found others standing idle and saith
[21:30] unto them why stand ye hear all the day
[21:32] idle
[21:34] they say unto him because no man hath
[21:36] hired us
[21:37] he saith unto them go ye also into the
[21:39] vineyard and whatsoever is right that
[21:41] shall ye receive
[21:43] so when even was come the lord of the
[21:45] vineyard set unto his steward call the
[21:47] laborers and give them their hire
[21:49] beginning from the last unto the first
[21:52] and when they came that were hired about
[21:54] the eleventh hour they received every
[21:56] man a penny
[21:57] but when the first came they supposed
[21:59] that they should have received more
[22:01] and they likewise received every man a
[22:04] penny
[22:05] and when they had received it they
[22:06] murmured against the goodman of the
[22:08] house saying these last have wrought but
[22:10] one hour and thou hast made them equal
[22:13] unto us which have borne the burden and
[22:14] heat of the day
[22:16] but he answered one of them and said
[22:18] friend
[22:20] i do thee no wrong
[22:22] didst not thou agree with me for a penny
[22:25] take that thine is and go thy way
[22:28] i will give unto this last even as unto
[22:30] thee
[22:31] is it not lawful for me to do what i
[22:33] will with my own
[22:34] is thine i evil because i am good
[22:38] so the last shall be first and the first
[22:41] last
[22:43] for many be called
[22:44] but few chosen
[22:47] and jesus going up to jerusalem took the
[22:49] twelve disciples apart in the way and
[22:51] said unto them behold we go up to
[22:53] jerusalem
[22:54] and the son of man shall be betrayed
[22:55] unto the chief priests sent unto the
[22:57] scribes and they shall condemn him to
[23:00] death
[23:00] and shall deliver him to the gentiles to
[23:02] mock and to scourge and to crucify him
[23:06] and the third day he shall rise again
[23:09] then came to him the mother of zebedee's
[23:11] children with her sons worshiping him
[23:13] and desiring a certain thing of him and
[23:15] he said unto her what wilt thou she
[23:18] saith unto him grant that these my two
[23:20] sons may sit the one on my right hand
[23:22] and the other on the left in thy kingdom
[23:25] but jesus answered and said
[23:27] ye know not what ye ask
[23:29] are ye able to drink of the cup that i
[23:31] shall drink of and to be baptized with a
[23:33] baptism that i am baptized with
[23:36] they say unto him we are able
[23:38] and he saith unto them
[23:40] he shall drink indeed of my cup and be
[23:42] baptized with the baptism that i am
[23:44] baptized with
[23:46] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[23:48] left
[23:49] is not mine to give
[23:51] but it shall be given to them for whom
[23:52] it is prepared of my father
[23:55] and when the ten heard it they were
[23:57] moved with indignation against the two
[23:59] brethren but jesus called them unto him
[24:01] and said
[24:02] ye know that the princes of the gentiles
[24:05] exercise dominion over them
[24:07] and they that are great exercise
[24:09] authority upon them
[24:11] but it shall not be so among you
[24:13] but whosoever will be great among you
[24:15] let him be your minister and whosoever
[24:18] will be chief among you let him be your
[24:21] servant
[24:22] even as the son of man came not to be
[24:24] ministered unto but to minister and to
[24:26] give his life a ransom for many
[24:30] and as they departed from jericho a
[24:32] great multitude followed him
[24:34] and behold two blind men sitting by the
[24:36] wayside when they heard that jesus
[24:38] passed by cried out saying have mercy on
[24:41] us o lord thou son of david
[24:44] and the multitude rebuked them because
[24:45] they should hold their peace but they
[24:47] cried the more saying have mercy on us o
[24:49] lord thou son of david
[24:51] and jesus stood still and called them
[24:53] and said
[24:54] what will ye that i shall do unto you
[24:57] they say unto him lord
[24:59] that our eyes may be opened
[25:02] so jesus had compassion on them and
[25:04] touched their eyes
[25:06] and immediately their eyes received
[25:07] sight
[25:08] and they followed him
[25:10] and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem
[25:12] and were come to beth fiji unto the
[25:14] mount of olives then sent jesus to
[25:16] disciples saying unto them go into the
[25:19] village over against you and straight
[25:21] where you shall find an ass tied and a
[25:23] cult with her loose them and bring them
[25:26] unto me and if any man say ought unto
[25:28] you ye shall say the lord hath need of
[25:30] them
[25:31] and straightway he will send them
[25:34] all this was done
[25:36] that it might be fulfilled which was
[25:38] spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the
[25:41] daughter of zion behold thy king cometh
[25:44] unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass
[25:47] and occult the foal of an ass
[25:49] and the disciples went and did as jesus
[25:51] commanded them and brought the ass and
[25:53] the cult and put on them their clothes
[25:56] and they set him there on
[25:58] and a very great multitude spread their
[26:00] garments in the way others cut down
[26:02] branches from the trees and straw them
[26:05] in the way
[26:06] and the multitudes that went before and
[26:08] that followed cried saying hosanna to
[26:10] the son of david blessed is he that
[26:12] cometh in the name of the lord hosanna
[26:15] in the highest
[26:17] and when he was coming to jerusalem all
[26:19] the city was moved saying who is this
[26:22] and the multitude said this is jesus the
[26:24] prophet of nazareth of galilee
[26:27] and jesus went into the temple of god
[26:29] and cast out all them that sold and
[26:31] bought in the temple and overthrew the
[26:33] tables of the money changers and the
[26:35] seats of them that sold doves and said
[26:38] unto them it is written my house shall
[26:40] be called the house of prayer but ye
[26:42] have made it a den of thieves
[26:45] and the blind and the lame came to him
[26:47] in the temple and he healed them
[26:50] and when the chief priests and scribes
[26:52] saw the wonderful things that he did and
[26:54] the children crying in the temple and
[26:56] saying hosanna to the son of david
[26:58] they were sore displeased and said unto
[27:01] him hearst thou what these say
[27:04] and jesus saith unto them yay
[27:07] have ye never read out of the mouth of
[27:09] babes and sucklings thou hast perfected
[27:11] praise
[27:13] and he left them
[27:14] and went out of the city into bethany
[27:17] and he lodged there
[27:20] now in the morning as he returned into
[27:22] the city he hungered and when he saw a
[27:24] fig tree in the way he came to it and
[27:26] found nothing there on but leaves only
[27:28] and said unto it let no fruit grow on
[27:31] thee henceforward forever
[27:33] and presently the fig tree withered away
[27:36] and when the disciples saw it they
[27:37] marveled saying how soon is the fig tree
[27:40] withered away
[27:42] jesus answered and said unto them
[27:44] verily i say unto you
[27:46] if ye have faith
[27:48] and doubt not
[27:50] he shall not only do this which is done
[27:52] to the fig tree but also if he shall say
[27:54] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[27:56] be thou cast into the sea it shall be
[27:58] done
[27:59] and all things whatsoever you shall ask
[28:01] in prayer believing
[28:03] ye shall receive
[28:06] and when he was come into the temple the
[28:08] chief priests and the elders of the
[28:10] people came unto him as he was teaching
[28:11] and said by what authority doest thou
[28:13] these things and who gave thee this
[28:16] authority
[28:18] and jesus answered and said unto them
[28:21] i also will ask you one thing
[28:24] which if ye tell me i and likewise will
[28:26] tell you by what authority i do these
[28:28] things
[28:30] the baptism of john
[28:33] whence was it from heaven or of men
[28:37] and they reasoned with themselves saying
[28:39] if we shall say from heaven he will say
[28:41] unto us why did ye not then believe him
[28:45] but if we shall say
[28:46] of men
[28:48] we fear the people for all whole john is
[28:51] a prophet
[28:52] and they answered jesus and said
[28:54] we cannot tell
[29:00] [Music]
[29:54] you
