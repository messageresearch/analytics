[1:00:31] so
[1:00:31] we just ask that you pray for us uh we
[1:00:34] got up about four o'clock this morning
[1:00:36] in order to make the flight
[1:00:38] and uh
[1:00:40] we had intentions of getting some rest
[1:00:42] this afternoon but sometimes that
[1:00:44] doesn't work out
[1:00:45] but that's fine but we're happy to be
[1:00:47] here and
[1:00:48] um you know i
[1:00:50] i heard uh
[1:00:52] your pastor talk about the sister was a
[1:00:54] sister-in-law that had cancer
[1:00:56] yeah
[1:00:58] you know i had cancer
[1:01:00] back in 2001 i was diagnosed with
[1:01:03] prostate cancer and the saints of god
[1:01:06] prayed and by god's grace i stand here
[1:01:08] today cancer free that's our god
[1:01:12] and what he did one time he'll do again
[1:01:14] just the same so we we thank god
[1:01:18] and you know you were you're singing the
[1:01:19] song only believe only believe and i
[1:01:22] must tell you um
[1:01:24] as a as a young man
[1:01:26] i was very fortunate to sit in the
[1:01:29] branham tabernacle
[1:01:31] and uh and hear that song sung many
[1:01:35] times as the prophet of god came out and
[1:01:38] it's still every time i hear the song it
[1:01:40] stirs my heart because
[1:01:42] from that time i was age six i sat in
[1:01:45] the branham tabernacle my father was a
[1:01:47] brother branham's song leader there and
[1:01:50] brother neville's assistant and
[1:01:52] we just uh
[1:01:54] have so many memories from that time in
[1:01:56] our life and if i can't i just tell you
[1:01:58] one little story we
[1:02:00] 1964
[1:02:02] my brother and this is part of the
[1:02:03] message if you've studied the message
[1:02:05] you've probably read this
[1:02:07] my my brother became very sick
[1:02:10] and they didn't know what was wrong with
[1:02:11] him took him to the doctor and
[1:02:13] the doctor didn't know and after a week
[1:02:16] another week of being in pain and crying
[1:02:18] and so forth he was about 12 years old
[1:02:23] took him to another doctor and they
[1:02:25] couldn't find what was wrong with him
[1:02:26] and
[1:02:28] finally one night my father
[1:02:30] took him to the emergency room there in
[1:02:32] jeffersonville
[1:02:34] and uh i was standing there by my father
[1:02:36] and the doctor come out and he said mr
[1:02:38] capps he said i'm sorry to inform you he
[1:02:41] said your son's appendix has burst and
[1:02:45] there's poison that spread through his
[1:02:46] whole body and said
[1:02:48] we don't expect him to live until
[1:02:50] morning
[1:02:51] now
[1:02:52] we grew up living in jeffersonville
[1:02:54] there in such an atmosphere of faith
[1:02:58] we
[1:02:59] you know we knew that anything that
[1:03:01] satan would bring against us if we could
[1:03:03] get a hold of that prophet amen he could
[1:03:06] speak the word
[1:03:07] and so
[1:03:08] when the doctor told my father that my
[1:03:10] brother was going to die
[1:03:13] my father didn't get excited he said
[1:03:16] well we'll just call brother branham
[1:03:18] and they called brother random's house
[1:03:19] and
[1:03:20] there was no answer and he said well he
[1:03:22] said i'll call billy so we called billy
[1:03:25] paul and my dad said brother billy he
[1:03:27] said do you know who your father is he
[1:03:29] said i've just been told that my son
[1:03:32] is going to die before morning he said
[1:03:34] we need your father to pray
[1:03:36] and brother billy said well brother
[1:03:38] capps he goes i don't know for sure
[1:03:39] where he's at he said he went target
[1:03:41] shooting with brother joseph who brother
[1:03:44] joseph was a little boy about 10 years
[1:03:46] old then
[1:03:47] and he said if i see him i'll have him
[1:03:49] give you a call
[1:03:50] my father got ready to hang up the phone
[1:03:52] and
[1:03:55] brother billy said wait a minute brother
[1:03:56] capps he said daddy just pulled in the
[1:03:59] driveway he said if you can wait a
[1:04:01] minute i'll put him on the phone
[1:04:03] and so uh
[1:04:06] just a minute or two there brother
[1:04:07] branham came to the phone and
[1:04:09] i heard my dad say brother branham
[1:04:11] the doctors say my son's going to die
[1:04:14] he said would you pray
[1:04:16] and
[1:04:17] he said brother random didn't even pray
[1:04:20] he didn't pause he didn't take a second
[1:04:22] to take a minute he said brother capps
[1:04:25] he said thus saith the lord your son
[1:04:27] shall not die your son shall live and my
[1:04:30] and my brother lives today in kokomo
[1:04:32] indiana
[1:04:33] completely whole
[1:04:34] so that's our god amen
[1:04:37] so god answers prayer and god answers
[1:04:40] the spoken word of a prophet
[1:04:42] if a prophet god says it it has to come
[1:04:44] to pass and i told uh we had a little uh
[1:04:47] meal earlier today and i told some of
[1:04:49] the the saints uh about
[1:04:52] uh when the prophet speaks the word and
[1:04:54] we we found out you know in in in the
[1:04:56] message and i was trying to remember
[1:04:58] this afternoon the message and i still
[1:04:59] haven't found it there's one of the
[1:05:00] messages where uh brother branham is
[1:05:03] talking about
[1:05:04] uh
[1:05:05] uh he's talking about uh
[1:05:08] when his father
[1:05:10] courted his mother he did so
[1:05:13] by horse and buggy
[1:05:15] and he said then when i courted my wife
[1:05:17] i did so with uh
[1:05:22] model a ford i believe it was and he
[1:05:24] said when my son billy courted his wife
[1:05:27] he did so by a fancy sports car
[1:05:29] and he made this statement he said i
[1:05:31] suppose someday my grandson will court
[1:05:33] his wife by jet airplane
[1:05:36] now
[1:05:37] the only grandson he had at that time
[1:05:39] was billy paul's little boy who was paul
[1:05:41] and he was two years old
[1:05:44] of course so as as time went on brother
[1:05:46] branham passed george smith married
[1:05:48] rebecca and rebecca branham and they
[1:05:51] began to have children and
[1:05:54] so
[1:05:55] i think the second son they had his name
[1:05:56] was william
[1:05:58] and uh
[1:05:59] those of us who know him knew him uh
[1:06:01] call him will
[1:06:03] and uh
[1:06:04] so will was like a lot of young people
[1:06:06] in our in our country in our area of the
[1:06:09] wood we have a lot of messy churches
[1:06:11] around us uh they're just everywhere
[1:06:14] and uh seems like you know they're
[1:06:15] always having youth camps and youth
[1:06:16] meetings and youth banquets and youth
[1:06:18] this and youth that and it's a wonderful
[1:06:20] thing and then we have regular
[1:06:21] conventions you know and and the young
[1:06:24] people in our area they try to go to all
[1:06:26] those meetings that they can
[1:06:29] and so will lived in tucson arizona with
[1:06:32] his mom and dad with george and rebecca
[1:06:34] and he went to a convention that they
[1:06:36] had at brother jack palmer's in macon
[1:06:38] georgia and he met brother palmer's
[1:06:41] granddaughter
[1:06:42] and
[1:06:43] they talked and they became friends and
[1:06:46] they kept talking and phoning and
[1:06:48] writing and uh pretty soon they became
[1:06:50] better friends and then uh after a while
[1:06:53] they became better friends and the next
[1:06:55] thing you know they were in love
[1:06:58] and
[1:06:58] of course that's part of being a young
[1:07:00] person isn't it and uh
[1:07:02] but there was a problem
[1:07:05] will lived with his mom and dad in
[1:07:07] tucson
[1:07:08] and rannell lived in uh
[1:07:11] macon georgia and there's almost two
[1:07:12] thousand miles difference between them
[1:07:14] and so what were they going to do
[1:07:16] well will was a pretty smart boy he went
[1:07:19] and got a job working for american
[1:07:21] airlines
[1:07:23] and
[1:07:25] he would work all week
[1:07:27] and then come friday night
[1:07:29] back then if you worked for american
[1:07:30] airlines you could fly free
[1:07:32] and so he would hop a plane
[1:07:35] and fly to macon georgia
[1:07:37] and he did this
[1:07:38] every week for almost seven months
[1:07:41] thereby fulfilling the word of a prophet
[1:07:45] has said
[1:07:46] i suppose someday my grandson will court
[1:07:49] his wife by jet airplane so
[1:07:52] we never we can always put a lot of uh
[1:07:55] trust and a lot of confidence in the
[1:07:56] words of a prophet and so i i encourage
[1:08:00] people to to
[1:08:01] study the message read the message find
[1:08:03] yourself in the message the prophet of
[1:08:05] god told us he said we need to find
[1:08:07] ourselves uh in the bible
[1:08:11] but i believe we need to find ourselves
[1:08:13] in the message
[1:08:14] now having said that
[1:08:17] i found myself in the message
[1:08:19] and i'm going to read to you if i've got
[1:08:20] it here i thought i had it yeah here it
[1:08:22] is i found myself in the message i hope
[1:08:25] you can find yourself in the message and
[1:08:27] let me just read you this little quote
[1:08:29] and i've had it for years and i've
[1:08:31] carried it for years and you can see
[1:08:33] it's pretty ragged
[1:08:35] i'm going to read it to you
[1:08:37] this is from the message hearing
[1:08:40] receiving and acting uh it was preached
[1:08:43] in chautauqua ohio in 1960.
[1:08:46] brother branham says the believer has
[1:08:49] something to live for
[1:08:50] we ought to live like it reaching every
[1:08:53] day for everything that we can get a
[1:08:54] hold of from god
[1:08:57] leaving the world behind
[1:08:59] burning your ships every day
[1:09:01] burning the track behind you
[1:09:03] keep on moving reaching pulling seeking
[1:09:05] hungering thirsting for god
[1:09:09] now here's where i found myself he said
[1:09:11] we need to be real fanatical about it
[1:09:14] he just just move on
[1:09:16] he said a fanatic is an over-enthused
[1:09:19] person he said i am really a fanatic he
[1:09:22] said i'm over-enthused about my lord
[1:09:24] jesus christ how did he ever save me how
[1:09:27] did he ever give me the holy ghost why
[1:09:29] did he ever let me preach how did he let
[1:09:32] me love people and let people love me oh
[1:09:34] i'm so thrilled over him i just keep
[1:09:37] reaching with all that's in me
[1:09:39] stretching my skin to try to get to him
[1:09:41] just moving with everything that i've
[1:09:43] got that's what we should do
[1:09:46] church i found myself in the message i
[1:09:48] trust you can find yourself in the
[1:09:50] message if you look long enough if you
[1:09:53] search hard enough if you study enough
[1:09:56] you can find yourself
[1:09:58] in the message
[1:09:59] amen
[1:10:01] now i appreciate the musicians but i
[1:10:03] didn't dismiss them
[1:10:08] where are you all going
[1:10:10] [Laughter]
[1:10:14] i want to sing you a little song and
[1:10:16] maybe if you can follow me now following
[1:10:19] me singing is not a good thing
[1:10:21] sometimes i can't follow myself
[1:10:23] but there's a little song that i like
[1:10:27] and the title of it is i'll overcome now
[1:10:30] we know in the bible
[1:10:31] we're told
[1:10:33] that the saints of old
[1:10:35] they overcame
[1:10:37] by their testimony in the blood of the
[1:10:39] lamb is that right so this little song
[1:10:41] says i'll overcome and if you know it
[1:10:43] sing it with me but it goes like this
[1:10:46] by my testimony
[1:10:49] and the blood of the lamb
[1:10:52] well i'll overcome
[1:10:55] one day i
[1:10:56] am all the demons of hell
[1:11:00] can't stop god's little bride
[1:11:03] she's elected to stand
[1:11:05] and she will stand by her bridegroom
[1:11:08] side
[1:11:10] well beaten and bruised
[1:11:12] sawn asunder they say
[1:11:15] many saints lost their lives in various
[1:11:19] ways
[1:11:21] for jesus they died a testimony of love
[1:11:26] we'll meet them again
[1:11:29] at the marriage supper above
[1:11:31] oh by my testimony
[1:11:35] and the blood of the lamb
[1:11:39] well i'll overcome
[1:11:43] one day i am
[1:11:46] all the demons of hell
[1:11:50] can't stop god's little bride
[1:11:53] she's elected to stand
[1:11:55] and she will stand by her bright groom
[1:11:58] side
[1:12:01] we're worried and troubled
[1:12:04] in these last gentile
[1:12:06] days many are the trials
[1:12:10] we've known on our way
[1:12:13] but don't you be discouraged
[1:12:16] the battle's almost won
[1:12:19] and what we're now feeling
[1:12:23] is the rising of the sun
[1:12:27] oh by my testimony
[1:12:30] and the blood of the lamb
[1:12:34] well i'll overcome
[1:12:37] one day i am
[1:12:41] all the demons of hell
[1:12:44] can't stop god's little bride
[1:12:47] she's elected to stand and she will
[1:12:50] stand by her bright room side
[1:12:55] now here's the verse i like the
[1:12:56] rapture's in progress
[1:13:00] oh i can feel it in my soul
[1:13:03] this world's just a dressing room
[1:13:06] but heaven is my goal
[1:13:10] there's a faster dimension
[1:13:13] just waiting for me
[1:13:16] very soon i'll step over
[1:13:19] king jesus to see
[1:13:23] and by my testimony
[1:13:26] and the blood of the lamb
[1:13:29] well i'll overcome
[1:13:33] one day i am
[1:13:37] all the demons of hell
[1:13:40] can't stop god's little bride
[1:13:43] she's elected to stand and she will
[1:13:47] stand by her bright room side i'm going
[1:13:49] to sing that course one more time oh by
[1:13:52] my testimony

[1:13:58] lamb well i'll overcome
[1:14:04] one day i am

[1:14:52] wanted to say but it'll come to me let's
[1:14:54] stand and we'll read the scripture
[1:14:56] tonight
[1:15:00] i'm going to be reading from romans the
[1:15:02] 8th chapter
[1:15:04] and we're going to read romans 8 11-13
[1:15:08] and then we're going to move down to
[1:15:10] romans 12 1-2
[1:15:12] so romans chapter 8
[1:15:15] uh verse 11
[1:15:17] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:15:19] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:15:22] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:15:24] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:15:27] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:15:30] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:15:32] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[1:15:34] you live after the flesh you shall die
[1:15:37] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[1:15:39] the deeds of the body ye shall live can
[1:15:42] you say amen

[1:15:57] bodies a living sacrifice wholly
[1:15:59] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:16:02] reasonable service and be not conformed

[1:17:15] first thing first is take the coat off
[1:17:18] is that all right brother uh
[1:17:20] you know some i guess some people don't
[1:17:22] like it i don't know i don't ask usually
[1:17:29] tonight
[1:17:31] i want to speak on the subject
[1:17:33] of end time transformations
[1:17:36] and i'm going to read that uh verse 2 of
[1:17:38] chapter 12 there in romans again as for
[1:17:41] a text and it says and be not conformed
[1:17:43] to this world but be you transformed by
[1:17:45] the renewing of your mind that you may
[1:17:48] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:17:50] and perfect will of god
[1:17:52] now uh in dealing with our our subject
[1:17:55] tonight end time transformations of
[1:17:57] course we're talking about uh being
[1:17:59] transformed in the end time now the word
[1:18:02] transformation means a change
[1:18:06] has taken place
[1:18:07] something has been changed and made
[1:18:10] different than what it once was amen
[1:18:13] now no doubt many of you hear this
[1:18:16] evening have had a real transformation
[1:18:19] take place in your life and i can look
[1:18:21] out and i can see the response and i can
[1:18:23] see that is exactly the truth we've got
[1:18:25] a group of people here that have had a
[1:18:28] transformation take place in your life
[1:18:30] and no doubt and and i don't know
[1:18:32] anything i've not talked to your pastor
[1:18:34] about the church or anything but no
[1:18:36] doubt uh uh many of you and maybe most
[1:18:39] of you had a transformation take place
[1:18:41] in your life maybe all of you i don't
[1:18:42] know but
[1:18:44] you have been changed from a sinner into
[1:18:47] a child of god
[1:18:49] we say thank you lord amen to god be the
[1:18:51] glory
[1:18:52] and no doubt maybe in a a crowd this
[1:18:55] size i don't know but maybe there's
[1:18:57] someone here tonight that needs a
[1:18:59] transformation in your life
[1:19:02] we can pretty much say that with a
[1:19:04] surety wherever we go uh there seems to
[1:19:06] be always somebody well even the prophet
[1:19:08] of god is three kind of believers in
[1:19:10] every assembly you know uh but we like
[1:19:12] to believe that everybody here is a
[1:19:14] fully revealed uh transformed person but
[1:19:18] uh maybe someone here this evening needs
[1:19:21] a transformation in your life i don't
[1:19:23] know maybe you need to be changed from a
[1:19:25] sinner to a child of god and church
[1:19:28] listen young and old alike
[1:19:30] uh there is only one person that can
[1:19:32] bring forth a transformation in a
[1:19:35] personal life
[1:19:36] now that person
[1:19:38] is not buddha
[1:19:40] which you know that person is not
[1:19:42] muhammad
[1:19:43] that person is not allah
[1:19:46] it is not hare krishna
[1:19:48] it is not the pope
[1:19:51] it's not even the pastor
[1:19:54] the only person that can bring a true
[1:19:57] change or a true transformation in your
[1:20:00] life tonight is jesus
[1:20:02] christ the holy ghost
[1:20:05] young person if you're sitting here your
[1:20:07] mama can't do it for you your daddy
[1:20:09] can't do it for you your pastor can't do
[1:20:11] it for you even brother branham could
[1:20:13] not do it for you if he was here oh but
[1:20:16] there uh but the message of jesus christ
[1:20:20] that brother branham preached can bring
[1:20:22] a transformation in your life he said
[1:20:24] this message is jesus christ i don't
[1:20:27] know what you think about that but when
[1:20:29] i hear that statement i believe that if
[1:20:31] you can fall in love with this message
[1:20:34] you can fall in love with jesus christ
[1:20:37] in fact i think sometimes we need to
[1:20:39] fall in love with with this message in
[1:20:41] order to find jesus christ i believe
[1:20:44] there's according to what the prophet
[1:20:45] taught us they're one and the same
[1:20:48] now am i too loud am i i'm not all right
[1:20:51] i'm just just checking here i don't want
[1:20:53] to get out of order you know
[1:20:55] [Laughter]
[1:20:58] this message is jesus christ
[1:21:00] church this message is not a bunch of
[1:21:02] strange doctrines
[1:21:04] or strange uh revelations
[1:21:08] this message
[1:21:09] is not a bunch of rules
[1:21:12] not a bunch of do's and don'ts
[1:21:14] uh this message is just fall in love
[1:21:17] with jesus
[1:21:19] and you will know what to do you don't
[1:21:20] need a list of rules you don't really
[1:21:22] need a list of do's and don'ts just fall
[1:21:24] in love with jesus when you fall in love
[1:21:26] with jesus you know what to do you know
[1:21:29] what not to do
[1:21:31] you say brother kenny how can you say
[1:21:32] that i can say that because that's
[1:21:34] exactly what happened to me
[1:21:36] when i fell in love with jesus christ oh
[1:21:39] i didn't need a list i didn't need a
[1:21:41] bunch of rules i needed one thing and
[1:21:44] that's more of the holy ghost
[1:21:46] and that's exactly what i need still
[1:21:48] tonight and i would venture to say
[1:21:50] that's what you need tonight we all need
[1:21:53] more of the holy ghost
[1:21:55] amen
[1:21:56] the only person
[1:21:58] that can bring a true change and true
[1:22:01] transformation in your life is jesus
[1:22:04] christ
[1:22:05] oh my the message of jesus christ the
[1:22:08] revelation of jesus christ can transform
[1:22:12] you this evening
[1:22:13] from
[1:22:14] uh uh from a sinner into a saint
[1:22:17] this message has transforming power
[1:22:20] this end time message
[1:22:26] given to us by god's servant
[1:22:28] william branham
[1:22:30] can make you a child of god
[1:22:33] let me drink a little water here
[1:22:42] the message can even transform you
[1:22:46] from a church member into a member of
[1:22:48] the bride of christ
[1:22:50] do you know who you are this evening we
[1:22:52] had a little talk this morning with some
[1:22:54] of the brothers and sisters there
[1:22:56] eating breakfast and
[1:22:57] and
[1:22:59] it came out that
[1:23:01] uh
[1:23:02] we need to know who we are yeah
[1:23:04] and you know now if it's all right
[1:23:06] uh
[1:23:07] sometimes when i preach i tell stories
[1:23:09] because it helps make the point
[1:23:12] and i when i speak of knowing who you
[1:23:14] are
[1:23:15] it's so important
[1:23:17] that you know who you are
[1:23:19] now who you are
[1:23:22] is the bride of jesus christ
[1:23:25] you have to know who you are
[1:23:28] it's not good enough that your pastor
[1:23:30] can look and say oh i believe they're a
[1:23:32] bride of christ
[1:23:33] you have to know
[1:23:35] who you are and i'd like to tell a
[1:23:37] little story to kind of confirm that
[1:23:39] a year several years ago and you may
[1:23:41] have heard this story before i think
[1:23:42] other ministers have told it
[1:23:44] uh several years ago it's probably 25 30
[1:23:48] years ago now harvard university did a
[1:23:51] study
[1:23:52] they wanted to find out
[1:23:55] who the most well-known personality in
[1:23:58] the whole world was
[1:23:59] they did a study you know what they
[1:24:02] found out maybe you know
[1:24:04] they found out
[1:24:06] that the most
[1:24:08] recognized personality in the world
[1:24:11] was a boxer
[1:24:12] by the name of muhammad ali
[1:24:15] because of his
[1:24:17] his
[1:24:19] worldwide persona
[1:24:21] they
[1:24:22] felt that he was the most widely known
[1:24:25] personality in the world at that time
[1:24:28] now muhammad ali was a boxer
[1:24:32] and what i
[1:24:34] you maybe some of you young ones don't
[1:24:35] know exactly who he was but i'm sure the
[1:24:38] people
[1:24:39] up getting close to my age would know
[1:24:40] who he was
[1:24:41] but he was he was known as the great
[1:24:43] champion
[1:24:44] he was known as the boxing prophet
[1:24:47] now he fought out of louisville kentucky
[1:24:50] that was supposed to be his home but
[1:24:51] what people don't know
[1:24:53] he was born
[1:24:54] and raised in jeffersonville
[1:24:56] indiana and
[1:24:58] we know
[1:25:00] there's a lot of great prophets came out
[1:25:02] of jeffersonville right
[1:25:04] [Laughter]
[1:25:07] and he was known as the boxing prophet
[1:25:09] and then i like it
[1:25:10] as a humorous note i like to go back and
[1:25:12] and show how that brother branham said a
[1:25:14] new testament preacher is also a prophet
[1:25:19] i was born in jeffersonville
[1:25:21] so i claimed that for myself
[1:25:23] [Laughter]
[1:25:25] no i'm just going on uh but muhammad ali
[1:25:28] was born and raised in jeffersonville
[1:25:30] indiana and he uh became quite a notable
[1:25:34] boxer and of course his family moved to
[1:25:36] the bigger cities and that was where he
[1:25:37] fought out of louisville kentucky
[1:25:40] but
[1:25:40] muhammad ali
[1:25:42] was
[1:25:44] he was a great champion
[1:25:47] i think he only lost maybe two or three
[1:25:49] fights in his whole career but he was he
[1:25:51] was extremely he was he was a great
[1:25:53] conqueror
[1:25:55] he conquered most all of his foes
[1:25:57] and uh now in order to
[1:26:00] win a lot of these boxing matches
[1:26:03] uh
[1:26:04] muhammad ali had to do much work
[1:26:06] he had to run he had to run i read some
[1:26:09] time that he ran 14 to 18 miles every
[1:26:12] day when he was preparing for a fight uh
[1:26:14] he he sparred and fought and practiced
[1:26:17] with some of the greatest boxers in the
[1:26:18] world
[1:26:19] and he
[1:26:20] it took a lot of energy it took a lot of
[1:26:23] time it took a lot of strength
[1:26:25] and uh
[1:26:26] there was in other words there was much
[1:26:28] work that he had to do in order to
[1:26:30] become a great champion and a great
[1:26:32] conqueror right
[1:26:34] and uh he would go into a fight and he
[1:26:37] would win the fight and the promoter
[1:26:40] would bring him
[1:26:41] a check
[1:26:42] sometimes 18 million dollars
[1:26:45] sometimes 22 million dollars i think one
[1:26:47] time he made 40 million dollars and they
[1:26:50] present him with a check for 40 million
[1:26:52] or whatever it was
[1:26:54] and uh
[1:26:55] but
[1:26:56] he he was a great champion he he was the
[1:26:58] conqueror
[1:27:00] but you know
[1:27:02] sitting at home
[1:27:04] was a little lady
[1:27:06] by the name of mrs muhammad ali
[1:27:10] and
[1:27:12] she didn't even go to the fights
[1:27:14] she said at home and maybe listen to it
[1:27:16] on the radio or the tv or whatever
[1:27:18] and when muhammad ali
[1:27:22] would win the great fight
[1:27:24] and
[1:27:25] receive the big check
[1:27:27] he would take that check home
[1:27:29] and he would hand it to mrs muhammad ali
[1:27:34] now he was a great champion a great
[1:27:37] conqueror
[1:27:38] but she was more than a conqueror
[1:27:42] she didn't she didn't have to she didn't
[1:27:45] have to work and run and practice and
[1:27:48] fight
[1:27:51] she just set it home and received the
[1:27:54] reward
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:57] and
[1:27:58] it makes me think of another great
[1:28:00] champion
[1:28:02] jesus christ
[1:28:05] he's already won the great battles
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:09] and he's put the money in the bank
[1:28:12] for the bride of christ his wife
[1:28:14] and the money is in the bank the
[1:28:16] spiritual money's in the bank
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:19] whatever you have need of you are more
[1:28:21] than a conqueror you didn't have to do
[1:28:23] the fighting you didn't have to do
[1:28:25] battle but you are more than a conqueror
[1:28:29] because the promises are all yours
[1:28:33] it's it's maybe not a good analogy but
[1:28:34] we say if you need healing just write a
[1:28:37] check
[1:28:38] write a spiritual check yes if you need
[1:28:41] if you need finances write a check
[1:28:44] now there's things that go along with
[1:28:46] that of course but you know there's
[1:28:47] something about mrs muhammad ali
[1:28:52] she knew who she was
[1:28:55] now when
[1:28:57] when she
[1:28:59] had the big check for 40 million dollars
[1:29:03] and she took it to the bank
[1:29:06] she didn't go in and
[1:29:08] say well i've got this check here and
[1:29:12] i don't i don't know if you'll honor it
[1:29:14] or not
[1:29:15] you know it's
[1:29:17] made out to my husband and
[1:29:18] he's endorsed it over to me and
[1:29:21] i'd like to would it be all right if i
[1:29:23] put it in the into my account
[1:29:26] no
[1:29:28] she knew who she wants
[1:29:31] she strode into that bank
[1:29:33] she said here
[1:29:35] put this check in my account
[1:29:37] and she could do it with authority
[1:29:39] because she knew who she was
[1:29:42] but you know it reminds me of some
[1:29:43] christians and some message believers
[1:29:44] sometimes
[1:29:46] oh they've got all these promises in the
[1:29:48] book
[1:29:49] well
[1:29:50] i don't know you know the pastor prayed
[1:29:53] for me and
[1:29:54] i guess
[1:29:55] i guess i'll be healed
[1:29:58] you got to know who you are
[1:30:01] she knew who she was and when she got
[1:30:03] ready to go buy a new dress
[1:30:05] she didn't go into the the dress store
[1:30:08] and say well
[1:30:11] i i i like
[1:30:12] like to buy
[1:30:14] i like to buy a new dress
[1:30:17] i guess we got money in the bank no
[1:30:20] she stole her she says put this on my
[1:30:23] account
[1:30:24] because she knew who she was church we
[1:30:27] need to realize who we are
[1:30:29] we are the bride of jesus christ that's
[1:30:31] right the prophet of god said
[1:30:34] in the message the rising of the son he
[1:30:36] said now elijah was mr jesus christ he
[1:30:40] said elisha is mrs jesus christ church
[1:30:44] we have a double portion of what the
[1:30:46] prophet of god had for this day but we
[1:30:49] have to know who we are we have to rise
[1:30:51] up and accept what god has made us
[1:30:55] and stop
[1:30:56] stop mealy-mouthing around
[1:30:58] well you know
[1:30:59] we had that evangelist come and he
[1:31:02] preached and
[1:31:03] you know he said we could
[1:31:05] we could be healed well i sure hope it
[1:31:08] happens no
[1:31:09] you've got to know who you are
[1:31:10] so
[1:31:11] uh i won't charge any extra for that
[1:31:13] store
[1:31:16] i just think that's a good analogy
[1:31:18] but we have to know who we are
[1:31:20] and uh so
[1:31:22] do you know who you are this evening
[1:31:24] you should know by now
[1:31:27] church
[1:31:28] we have jesus christ on our hands
[1:31:32] what are we going to do with him
[1:31:35] young person you have jesus christ on
[1:31:37] your hands tonight what are you going to
[1:31:40] do with him
[1:31:41] in the message god's power to transform
[1:31:44] that prophet of god priests in september
[1:31:45] of 1965 brother branham said this he
[1:31:48] said god has the power to transform but
[1:31:52] the enemy satan cannot transform he can
[1:31:55] only deform
[1:31:57] god is the transformer
[1:31:59] satan is the deformer
[1:32:01] satan is a perverter pervert means to
[1:32:03] make some change over st make something
[1:32:06] worse than what it once was
[1:32:08] deformed means to change the original
[1:32:11] use of
[1:32:12] and what it once was only god can create
[1:32:16] satan cannot create he can only pervert
[1:32:19] what god has created he can only make
[1:32:22] worse what god has created
[1:32:24] and he can only make you worse than what
[1:32:27] god created you to do
[1:32:30] you have to know who you are
[1:32:33] now looking back to genesis 1
[1:32:36] we find
[1:32:43] that the world
[1:32:44] was that was without form and void is
[1:32:46] that right that's right
[1:32:49] was
[1:32:51] nothing but darkness
[1:32:53] was upon the face of the earth
[1:32:55] brother brown said
[1:32:57] the earth was nothing but a complete
[1:32:58] chaos
[1:33:02] and brother branham said
[1:33:04] when the world was in that chaos
[1:33:06] condition
[1:33:08] the spirit of god moved upon the face of
[1:33:10] the earth and the entire picture was
[1:33:13] changed from a total chaos from nothing
[1:33:16] into a beautiful garden of eden
[1:33:20] i thought that was beautiful church that
[1:33:22] is the transforming power of god the
[1:33:25] power that can take nothing and make
[1:33:27] something out of it make something
[1:33:29] wonderful out of it the power to take a
[1:33:32] teenage life that satan has tried to
[1:33:34] deform and pervert and make it a
[1:33:37] beautiful thing
[1:33:38] young person church tonight if we were
[1:33:41] ever a child of god then we were always
[1:33:44] a child of god stay with me now we were
[1:33:46] a potential child of god in seed form
[1:33:49] from the foundation of the world now
[1:33:52] growing up you may not have always
[1:33:54] looked much like a child of god at times
[1:33:58] and i'm sure i didn't
[1:34:04] didn't look like it
[1:34:06] didn't act like it
[1:34:08] but that does not change who you are
[1:34:11] are you with me that tonight
[1:34:12] every one of us needed to be transformed
[1:34:15] we were all born in sin and shaped in
[1:34:17] iniquity because every one of us was
[1:34:20] born in that condition and we came into
[1:34:22] the world speaking lies
[1:34:24] some of you here this evening
[1:34:26] still need maybe to be
[1:34:28] transformed
[1:34:30] now if the spirit of god can move upon
[1:34:33] the face of the earth this huge planet
[1:34:36] earth that was in total darkness if the
[1:34:38] spirit of god can move upon the face of
[1:34:41] the earth and make it something
[1:34:42] wonderful then i believe that the same
[1:34:45] spirit of god the holy ghost can move
[1:34:48] upon this piece of earth
[1:34:50] you're made up of 16 elements of the
[1:34:52] earth the holy ghost can move upon this
[1:34:55] earth
[1:34:58] and make something wonderful out of it
[1:35:04] this earth
[1:35:05] that was born in total darkness
[1:35:09] can be made something wonderful
[1:35:12] by the spirit of god
[1:35:14] in fact i know for a fact that that is
[1:35:17] true
[1:35:18] because it happened to me
[1:35:22] i was there when it happened and i guess
[1:35:24] i ought to know
[1:35:27] well if i could sing i'd sing the song
[1:35:31] but
[1:35:31] i i just know it can happen
[1:35:34] i've seen it happen
[1:35:35] i've been to 60 countries doing mission
[1:35:38] work i've seen it happen hundreds of
[1:35:40] times when
[1:35:42] a young person or sometimes an older
[1:35:45] person
[1:35:46] has just got so fed up with life and
[1:35:48] they're ready to give it all over to
[1:35:50] jesus christ and i see christ come and
[1:35:53] change the nature of that person
[1:35:56] and make them something wonderful now in
[1:35:58] the same message god's power to
[1:35:59] transform brother brandon uh talked
[1:36:02] about the tadpole
[1:36:04] you know what the tadpole is right we
[1:36:06] all know what the tadpole is
[1:36:08] he said uh
[1:36:14] that tadpole
[1:36:16] transforms
[1:36:17] from a
[1:36:19] little swimming
[1:36:20] element
[1:36:22] into a frog is that right
[1:36:25] see these boys know
[1:36:28] now that tadpole
[1:36:30] always had the potentials
[1:36:32] of a frog
[1:36:34] brother kenny where are you going with
[1:36:36] this just stay with me that tadpole
[1:36:39] always had the potentials of a frog
[1:36:42] it was a frog in the very beginning
[1:36:45] even when it was a tadpole it was a frog
[1:36:48] but one day it had to come to
[1:36:50] manifestation as a frog
[1:36:52] it had to have a transformation
[1:36:55] and when the transformation came it was
[1:36:57] now manifesting what it always was
[1:37:01] it had to have a transformation now
[1:37:05] we could also look at the caterpillar
[1:37:08] you all know the caterpillar
[1:37:10] caterpillar's a little warm you know
[1:37:12] it crawls here it crawls there you know
[1:37:15] but you know what
[1:37:16] that caterpillar
[1:37:18] was always a butterfly
[1:37:20] that ugly little worm was always a
[1:37:24] butterfly
[1:37:25] and at some point in its life it had to
[1:37:27] manifest what it truly was what its
[1:37:30] potentials were stay with me
[1:37:32] now that tadpole always had the
[1:37:35] potentials of a frog
[1:37:37] even when it was a tadpole
[1:37:39] one day it came to manifestation as a
[1:37:41] frog
[1:37:43] now we can look at the caterpillar that
[1:37:45] caterpillar always had the potentials to
[1:37:47] be a beautiful butterfly but it too one
[1:37:50] day had to manifest what it truly always
[1:37:52] was
[1:37:54] it was a butterfly even when it was a
[1:37:56] worm
[1:37:57] now it was a little worm and it'd crawl
[1:37:59] on the tree you know
[1:38:01] and maybe that little
[1:38:03] caterpillar
[1:38:05] in its early life
[1:38:06] maybe it was crawling into places it
[1:38:09] shouldn't go
[1:38:10] maybe maybe that caterpillar crawled
[1:38:12] into a disco somewhere or crawled into a
[1:38:15] saloon or crawled into some place it
[1:38:17] should not be but you know what that
[1:38:19] didn't change what that
[1:38:21] caterpillar really was
[1:38:23] it just had to come to manifestation of
[1:38:26] what it was truly meant to be
[1:38:28] now brother kenny where are you going
[1:38:30] with this
[1:38:34] praise the lord
[1:38:37] it was a butterfly
[1:38:39] even when it was a little worm and it
[1:38:42] had to come to manifest manifestation of
[1:38:44] what it truly was but the caterpillar
[1:38:47] had to be transformed into what it
[1:38:49] always was meant to be which was the
[1:38:51] butterfly and church young person
[1:38:53] tonight you may be sitting here today
[1:38:55] you are you may know that your life is
[1:38:57] not what it should be
[1:39:00] i don't know
[1:39:02] we're just throwing out thoughts here
[1:39:03] you may know that your life is not what
[1:39:05] it should be not yet having been
[1:39:06] transformed or coming to manifestation
[1:39:09] of what god intended you to be
[1:39:12] but i believe
[1:39:14] if you were raised in a message home i
[1:39:16] believed if you were raised in a messy
[1:39:18] church god knows all things god ordained
[1:39:21] you to be in a home like that he
[1:39:23] ordained you to be in a church and it
[1:39:25] was for your benefit it was for your
[1:39:28] glorification and it was for a
[1:39:29] manifestation to come forth in your life
[1:39:35] maybe your life hasn't yet
[1:39:37] manifested what god intended it to be
[1:39:41] you may be sitting here tonight
[1:39:43] and sometimes we don't know especially
[1:39:45] for young people you don't always know
[1:39:50] you may be doing things that you should
[1:39:52] not be doing
[1:39:53] even old people
[1:39:55] sometimes we get caught up in situations
[1:39:57] you know but the right atmosphere
[1:40:00] can be
[1:40:01] and i believe it has been created
[1:40:03] in this service tonight for you to
[1:40:05] receive your transformation
[1:40:08] all right
[1:40:09] brother branham said the preaching of
[1:40:11] the word creates the atmosphere whereby
[1:40:14] you can receive
[1:40:16] whatever you have need of
[1:40:19] now we know
[1:40:20] from science that every transformation
[1:40:23] takes place in a dark place did you know
[1:40:25] that
[1:40:26] every transformation takes place in a
[1:40:28] dark place
[1:40:33] watch now
[1:40:34] that tadpole is swimming around in a
[1:40:37] pond or lake or some water somewhere
[1:40:43] maybe a river
[1:40:44] and at a certain time of life
[1:40:47] that tadpole
[1:40:49] goes into the darkness of the water up
[1:40:51] near the shore under the old leaves that
[1:40:54] have fallen and it's it's a dark place
[1:40:56] in that water up near the shore and he
[1:40:58] goes into that dark place up near the
[1:41:00] shore somewhere and over time that there
[1:41:03] is a transformation that takes place in
[1:41:06] that dark murky water
[1:41:09] that darkness and that tadpole
[1:41:12] has a final transformation
[1:41:14] as a frog
[1:41:16] but it happens when the tadpole
[1:41:20] gets in a dark place
[1:41:22] now the tadpole had to get in the right
[1:41:24] atmosphere the right condition at the
[1:41:26] right time to receive its transformation
[1:41:30] now the transformation comes when he
[1:41:32] gets in a dark place also we find the
[1:41:35] caterpillar it had to go into the cocoon
[1:41:38] in the darkness of the cocoon to be
[1:41:40] transformed at a certain time of life it
[1:41:42] has to go that little worm has to go up
[1:41:45] into that cast cocoon and and seal it
[1:41:47] off and while it's in there in that dark
[1:41:49] place there's a transformation that
[1:41:51] takes place and that transformation
[1:41:53] transforms that caterpillar into a
[1:41:56] beautiful butterfly
[1:41:58] it has to come to manifestation
[1:42:04] and tonight
[1:42:05] the change of a sinner to a child of god
[1:42:08] stay with me now comes when the sinner
[1:42:10] comes from the darkness into the light
[1:42:13] are you with me
[1:42:15] but the transformation takes place while
[1:42:17] he's still in darkness
[1:42:20] while he's in darkness he may get so
[1:42:23] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:42:26] and he decides there's a transformation
[1:42:29] that needs to come in his life
[1:42:31] and when he gets in that condition then
[1:42:34] he's in the right place to receive the
[1:42:36] manifestation of what he already was he
[1:42:40] just didn't know who he was but he has
[1:42:42] to come to that none of that knowledge
[1:42:44] he has to come to that transformation he
[1:42:46] has to come to that manifestation of
[1:42:49] what god always intended him to be and a
[1:42:52] child of god i don't care what he's done
[1:42:54] i don't care where he's been i don't
[1:42:56] care the life that he's lived but i
[1:42:58] believe that if a
[1:43:00] young man or a young lady was born in a
[1:43:02] message home raised in a message church
[1:43:05] i believe that it was a child of god
[1:43:08] from the very beginning and it has to
[1:43:10] come to manifestation of what it already
[1:43:13] was what he or she already was
[1:43:16] but the transformation takes place
[1:43:20] in a dark place
[1:43:22] the change of a sinner
[1:43:25] to a child of god comes when that sinner
[1:43:27] comes from the darkness into the light
[1:43:33] but the transformation takes place while
[1:43:35] he's in the darkness then he comes into
[1:43:38] the light
[1:43:39] now
[1:43:40] that young person
[1:43:42] always had the potentials of a child of
[1:43:45] god laying within him
[1:43:47] all the potentials of an overcomer are
[1:43:50] in you right now all right let's let's
[1:43:53] move on from the from the center now
[1:43:54] let's let's talk about the christian
[1:43:56] who's having struggles but
[1:43:59] there comes a time when that creature
[1:44:01] that christian all the potentials of an
[1:44:04] overcomer are in you right now and you
[1:44:07] have to come to manifestation as an
[1:44:10] overcomer
[1:44:12] by your testimony and the blood of the
[1:44:14] lamb
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:18] and when that transformation takes place
[1:44:21] it takes place in the darkness
[1:44:23] then he comes into the light
[1:44:25] all the potentials of a child of god are
[1:44:28] laying within you right now all the
[1:44:30] potentials of an overcomer are in you
[1:44:32] right now all you need for fulfilling
[1:44:34] god's purpose in your life is laying
[1:44:37] within you right now
[1:44:41] the potentials
[1:44:42] of an overcomer the potentials of more
[1:44:45] than a conqueror they are in you right
[1:44:47] now
[1:44:48] but you have to come to the knowledge of
[1:44:51] who you are you have to realize for once
[1:44:53] and for all that i am a child of god i
[1:44:57] am the bride of christ the bride of
[1:44:59] christ will have a double portion of
[1:45:01] what the the prophet had and it has to
[1:45:04] come to place we see it happening in
[1:45:06] foreign lands more than we do here in
[1:45:09] america
[1:45:13] when you receive the baptism of the holy
[1:45:15] ghost brother madam said everything you
[1:45:17] have need of from earth to glory is
[1:45:20] laying within you right now
[1:45:22] he said when you get the holy ghost he
[1:45:24] said i don't believe that god needs to
[1:45:26] add one more thing
[1:45:28] it's all there right then
[1:45:31] so the most important thing is receiving
[1:45:34] the holy ghost
[1:45:36] and how do we do that we do what acts 2
[1:45:38] 38 says repent and be baptized every one
[1:45:40] of you in the name of jesus christ for
[1:45:42] the remission of your sins and you might
[1:45:43] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:45:46] you shall receive the baptism of the
[1:45:49] holy ghost
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:53] all we need is god's power of
[1:45:55] transformation to bring these potentials
[1:45:57] in our life and bring us to
[1:45:59] manifestation now when i think of being
[1:46:01] transformed in the end time i can look
[1:46:04] back to genesis 1 that in order for a
[1:46:06] natural seed to be manifested it most
[1:46:10] must first be placed in a dark place is
[1:46:12] that right
[1:46:14] a natural seed
[1:46:15] and remember every transformation takes
[1:46:18] place in a dark place
[1:46:20] all right that natural seed has to be
[1:46:23] placed in the darkness of the ground in
[1:46:25] the darkness of the earth it has to be
[1:46:27] placed there in order for the law of
[1:46:29] light to work
[1:46:31] the long light was designed to conquer
[1:46:34] darkness church that's good news
[1:46:36] the law of light was made to conquer
[1:46:39] darkness if you have an area of your
[1:46:42] life where there's much darkness i've
[1:46:43] got news for you there is
[1:46:46] there is a light
[1:46:48] that can overcome the darkness and that
[1:46:50] light is jesus christ that light is the
[1:46:53] message of the hour that light
[1:46:55] is what god has ordained for his bride
[1:47:01] amen
[1:47:02] the love light was designed to conquer
[1:47:06] darkness put the seed in the ground
[1:47:09] let the sunlight shine on it
[1:47:11] don't dig it up every few days to see if
[1:47:14] it's growing
[1:47:15] leave it in the ground
[1:47:17] let the sun shine on it
[1:47:19] and it will come to manifestation
[1:47:23] and you can't stop it
[1:47:25] and if that's true in the natural how
[1:47:28] much more is that true in the spiritual
[1:47:30] i'm looking at a group of people who
[1:47:32] have had that experience in their life
[1:47:35] who have had darkness in their life
[1:47:37] they've
[1:47:38] put it under the light of god and it has
[1:47:40] come to manifestation
[1:47:44] and they know who they are
[1:47:46] put the seed in the ground let the
[1:47:48] sunlight shine on it and it will
[1:47:51] manifest
[1:47:52] you cannot stop it that seed will be
[1:47:56] transformed now brother branham said
[1:47:58] back in genesis 1 when the earth was
[1:48:00] covered in darkness he said every seed
[1:48:02] that ever would manifest itself was
[1:48:04] laying in the earth there right then
[1:48:07] you believe that the prophet said it
[1:48:09] god's power to transform has the ability
[1:48:12] to root over every seed laying in
[1:48:15] darkness
[1:48:16] say well brother kenny you're talking
[1:48:17] about a natural seed i'm talking about a
[1:48:19] spiritual seed also
[1:48:20] did you know that the prophet god taught
[1:48:22] us that natural things type spiritual
[1:48:25] god said in the book of isaiah i will
[1:48:28] bring treasure out of darkness
[1:48:30] church that's you and me
[1:48:32] we are the treasure that god has brought
[1:48:35] out of darkness and has shined the light
[1:48:37] of the word on and we are manifesting
[1:48:40] what god intended us to be from the very
[1:48:42] beginning
[1:48:44] down inside each and every one of you
[1:48:46] young people sitting here are you
[1:48:47] middle-aged person or you old person
[1:48:50] there is a treasure buried in your heart
[1:48:53] in your life
[1:48:54] and your earth and it takes the light of
[1:48:57] god to shine upon your earth and the
[1:48:59] light of god brings forth that treasure
[1:49:02] out of darkness
[1:49:04] some of us was in more darkness than
[1:49:06] others there's many forms of darkness
[1:49:08] but the law of light is designed to
[1:49:12] conquer any darkness yes sir in genesis
[1:49:15] 32 there was a transformation in the end
[1:49:18] time of jacob's life i'm sure you've
[1:49:21] read about it jacob was a shyster he was
[1:49:23] a deceiver but in the darkness of the
[1:49:25] night
[1:49:27] remember now transformation takes place
[1:49:29] in the dark
[1:49:30] jacob was a shyster a deceiver but in
[1:49:32] the darkness of the night the angel of
[1:49:34] the lord came and transformed jacob from
[1:49:37] a shyster and a deceiver into a limping
[1:49:40] prince with god that had power with god
[1:49:44] before men
[1:49:46] in exodus 12 it was in the darkness of
[1:49:49] the night that god sent the pillar of
[1:49:51] fire and delivered the children of
[1:49:54] israel
[1:49:55] is that right amen there was a
[1:49:57] transformation in the darkness of the
[1:49:59] night for the children of israel
[1:50:02] now we're
[1:50:04] we've said a lot of things we're we're
[1:50:06] going to
[1:50:07] we're going to get
[1:50:08] we're going to get to the point here
[1:50:10] okay
[1:50:10] now coming on down through time
[1:50:13] we see that the journey of jesus christ
[1:50:15] took him through much darkness
[1:50:19] jesus's journey of darkness is actually
[1:50:21] what brought deliverance to the world
[1:50:24] jesus was plunged into darkness on the
[1:50:27] cross
[1:50:28] at calvary why because there was a
[1:50:30] transformation that had to come in
[1:50:32] jesus's life a transformation had to
[1:50:35] take place when jesus was in the earth
[1:50:37] in the tomb because the savior had to be
[1:50:40] transformed
[1:50:42] jesus was a seed that had to go into the
[1:50:44] ground the darkness of the ground in
[1:50:46] order to bring life he was not meant to
[1:50:50] be in the darkness of the earth he was
[1:50:52] meant to be
[1:50:53] seated on a throne in heaven above
[1:50:56] but the transformation had to come
[1:51:00] the transformation had to take place
[1:51:03] here on earth
[1:51:04] in the darkness of the tomb
[1:51:08] and then on the third day we know the

[1:52:52] now
[1:52:53] here
[1:52:54] is the real message tonight
[1:52:58] god promised
[1:52:59] that in the end time there would be an
[1:53:02] army of jobs
[1:53:03] to rise up
[1:53:05] stay with me now
[1:53:06] he promised that in the end time there
[1:53:09] would be a resurrection
[1:53:11] and a rapture
[1:53:13] now now we're starting to talk about the
[1:53:16] real
[1:53:17] end time transformations
[1:53:19] he promised jesus christ promised that
[1:53:22] in the end time there would come forth
[1:53:24] the manifestation of the sons and
[1:53:26] daughters of god church that's you and i
[1:53:29] god has allotted unto you and i a time
[1:53:32] of great manifestation and in order for
[1:53:35] that manifestation to come there has to
[1:53:38] be a transformation
[1:53:41] now
[1:53:42] in this day
[1:53:48] the world
[1:53:50] has to come
[1:53:52] to a time
[1:53:53] of gross darkness
[1:53:59] and we can see it happening
[1:54:01] all around us
[1:54:04] is that right
[1:54:05] we can see it in america
[1:54:08] i've been to many countries you can see
[1:54:10] it in many countries we see it in north
[1:54:12] carolina i'm sure you see it here in
[1:54:14] minnesota
[1:54:17] young people the seed of god
[1:54:19] church the seed of god has to be planted
[1:54:22] in the heart of the earth somewhere and
[1:54:26] that seed had to be planted in darkness
[1:54:28] in order
[1:54:29] for a transformation to come
[1:54:31] now we're talking about a great
[1:54:33] transformation when we talk about the
[1:54:36] rapture
[1:54:38] the prophet of god said actually it's
[1:54:39] just another dimension he said just one
[1:54:41] step away take one step
[1:54:44] and from this dimension into that
[1:54:45] dimension
[1:54:47] now if every transformation has to take
[1:54:50] place in a dark place where we at we
[1:54:54] look around us and it looks pretty dark
[1:54:57] this world looks dark but see the
[1:55:00] believer he doesn't get
[1:55:02] he doesn't get defeated by that
[1:55:05] he recognizes victory in that the darker
[1:55:08] it gets church the closer to home you
[1:55:10] and i are
[1:55:12] and every transformation has to take
[1:55:14] place in a dark place and this world has
[1:55:16] to become darker and this world has to
[1:55:18] become darker we might think it's dark
[1:55:20] now but it has to be darker it has to
[1:55:23] come darker in order for us to get out
[1:55:25] of here for order for us to have a
[1:55:27] transformation it has to be dark yes
[1:55:31] we're well on the way but i don't
[1:55:33] believe we're fully there yet because
[1:55:35] when the true
[1:55:37] full darkness comes
[1:55:39] god's people are going to be gone
[1:55:41] that's when they'll be transformed
[1:55:43] that's the message tonight
[1:55:47] in the darkness of this world there will
[1:55:49] come a transformation
[1:55:52] i plan to be in that transformation
[1:55:55] i plan to be transformed oh i've had
[1:55:58] many transformations in my life
[1:56:00] i've had many transformations but i'm
[1:56:03] looking forward to that great
[1:56:05] transformation
[1:56:06] that transformation that man cannot do
[1:56:10] that only god can do
[1:56:12] church we ought to be victorious
[1:56:14] we ought to be excited that's right
[1:56:16] where's the world they're getting more
[1:56:18] depressed all the time more depressed
[1:56:20] and more depressed because of war
[1:56:22] because of killing because of this
[1:56:24] because of that but the true child of
[1:56:26] god should look forward
[1:56:29] and say
[1:56:30] my lord
[1:56:32] is ready for the great transformation
[1:56:35] praise the lord that's the end time
[1:56:37] transformation that's my message tonight
[1:56:40] all we can talk about these other things
[1:56:42] we can talk about caterpillars and
[1:56:45] tadpoles and that's good but i'm going
[1:56:47] to talk about a final transformation an
[1:56:50] end time transformation that'll pick up
[1:56:53] the children of god pick up the bride of
[1:56:55] christ and take her right out of here
[1:57:00] he said the world won't know what
[1:57:02] happened it'll be so few the world won't
[1:57:04] even know what happened
[1:57:07] praise the lord
[1:57:09] but you and i know
[1:57:10] because we'll be in it
[1:57:12] we'll be a part of it that's right we'll
[1:57:14] part it we're part of that end time
[1:57:16] transformation
[1:57:17] oh my
[1:57:18] oh my we can see it getting dark around
[1:57:21] us oh my
[1:57:23] oh and the seed of god
[1:57:25] was not planted in denomination the seed
[1:57:28] of god was not planted in politics the
[1:57:31] seed of god was not planted in movies or
[1:57:34] music the seed of god was planted in
[1:57:38] nothing
[1:57:41] it was not planted in a great religious
[1:57:43] move
[1:57:44] it was not planted
[1:57:47] in religion of any kind the sea of god
[1:57:50] was planted in the heart of the bride of
[1:57:53] jesus christ in the heart of this earth
[1:57:56] this earth
[1:57:58] as individual members of the bride that
[1:58:00] was ordained to eternal life
[1:58:03] church young people
[1:58:05] the seed of god was planted in you
[1:58:08] as individuals
[1:58:10] and that's the most important those last
[1:58:12] two words were the most important as
[1:58:14] individuals it's not good enough to come
[1:58:17] to a message church where they talk
[1:58:19] about the end time message and we can
[1:58:21] come to a message church and we can sit
[1:58:23] down oh praise god uh
[1:58:26] i'm waiting for the rapture well no i
[1:58:28] don't believe that's going to get it
[1:58:32] revelation 22 and 17
[1:58:34] 22 and 17 says the spirit and the bride
[1:58:37] say come

[1:58:43] message
[1:58:45] it was not a different message than what
[1:58:47] elijah had it was the same message but
[1:58:50] it was a further manifestation of
[1:58:52] elijah's message and you and i we have a
[1:58:54] job to do
[1:58:55] we won't change the message but it will
[1:58:58] be a further manifestation of the
[1:59:00] message that the prophet brought
[1:59:04] us
[1:59:05] praise the lord
[1:59:07] the spirit and the bride say come

[2:05:25] world today
[2:05:26] by the power of the resurrection this is
[2:05:29] a transforming day this is a
[2:05:31] transforming time when we look at the
[2:05:33] story of luke 24 early in the morning we
[2:05:37] see that two women had already come from
[2:05:39] the tomb of jesus they bore witness that
[2:05:42] his body does not lay there in that dark
[2:05:44] tomb anymore the stone was rolled away
[2:05:47] jesus had been transformed
[2:05:51] as the musicians come back
[2:05:53] the bible says
[2:05:54] joy comes in the morning
[2:05:57] oh my the bride's time has come church
[2:06:00] the time for weeping is over the time
[2:06:02] for depression and sadness is over
[2:06:05] there's a difference between a dead
[2:06:07] christ and a living christ all you have
[2:06:09] to do for a living christ
[2:06:11] in your life is to worship him
[2:06:15] the word of god is as a seed
[2:06:17] we make that seed grow
[2:06:19] by our praise
[2:06:21] because he was transformed you and i are
[2:06:24] transformed
[2:06:25] amen
[2:06:26] make that seed of god in you grow the
[2:06:29] prophet of god said this he said
[2:06:31] he said
[2:06:33] whatever little seed of god that you
[2:06:34] have in your life
[2:06:37] he said you make it grow
[2:06:39] by your praise
[2:06:41] and by your prayer
[2:06:43] you know i read that some
[2:06:45] 37 years ago
[2:06:47] and it struck home to me
[2:06:49] i was
[2:06:50] i was in a church
[2:06:52] i had gotten saved
[2:06:54] and i was in a church and i would come
[2:06:57] and i would sit in church
[2:06:59] and i'd listen to the singing
[2:07:01] and i thought it was great and i
[2:07:03] listened to the preaching and it was
[2:07:05] great and i just sat there
[2:07:06] but then one day i read what he said
[2:07:09] about you make that seed of god grow in
[2:07:11] your life by your praise
[2:07:14] and i just decided to put it to the test
[2:07:17] so i can remember going to church and i
[2:07:20] hearing something the preacher said that
[2:07:22] i knew that brother random said in the
[2:07:23] message and i would
[2:07:25] raise my hand sure
[2:07:28] i didn't say a word i just raised my
[2:07:30] hand
[2:07:32] and i'd go home that week
[2:07:34] and i could see god was blessing me
[2:07:36] so after a few weeks
[2:07:38] i'd come to church and i'd sit there
[2:07:40] and i hear something that was said or a
[2:07:42] song that was sung that meant something
[2:07:43] to me and i'd raised my hand i'd say
[2:07:45] amen
[2:07:46] sure and you know what god started
[2:07:49] blessing me
[2:07:51] i'd come to church
[2:07:53] and i'd sit there
[2:07:54] and after a few weeks
[2:07:57] amen
[2:07:59] i got a little courage you know
[2:08:01] got a little courage
[2:08:03] and uh
[2:08:04] god started blessing me and i noticed
[2:08:07] that things in the bible and things in
[2:08:09] the message were starting to come alive
[2:08:11] yes sir and so
[2:08:12] before too many weeks i was raised in
[2:08:14] both hands and then you know as time
[2:08:16] went on next thing you know i'm up and
[2:08:18] i'm praising god
[2:08:20] amen praise god
[2:08:24] and now the people in my church where i
[2:08:26] go
[2:08:28] they call me crazy
[2:08:32] i'm probably the only one in church
[2:08:33] that's dance i dance i shout i run the
[2:08:37] aisle and you know what the more even at
[2:08:39] this age even at this stage in my
[2:08:40] christian walk god is still blessing me
[2:08:42] more and more and i found out that what
[2:08:45] the prophet of god said was true he said
[2:08:48] to make that seed of god grow in your
[2:08:50] life you need to praise god the more i
[2:08:53] praise god the more he blessed me
[2:08:59] and i i think i told some of you a
[2:09:02] little bit of my testimony i i was i got
[2:09:05] married at age 18.
[2:09:07] my wife was 17. we had two children
[2:09:10] when one of them was three and one of us
[2:09:11] two
[2:09:12] we've been married about four years
[2:09:15] and my wife was killed in a car wreck
[2:09:18] and uh
[2:09:20] i was lost i mean i was i was
[2:09:22] i was destroyed you can imagine how it
[2:09:24] would be had two little boys to raise
[2:09:26] and
[2:09:27] and but we got it done but the secret to
[2:09:30] that me getting it done was my going to
[2:09:32] church and praising god because the more
[2:09:35] i went to church and praised god the
[2:09:36] more he blessed me with people in my
[2:09:38] life to help me with those children to
[2:09:40] to get me by
[2:09:42] and you know now i was raised in a
[2:09:44] fairly
[2:09:45] poor family we didn't have a lot

[2:09:49] to try to travel i wanted to see the
[2:09:52] world you know the bible says god to
[2:09:54] give you the desire of your heart is
[2:09:56] that right
[2:09:58] and i started praising god

[2:10:03] later after my
[2:10:04] first wife died
[2:10:07] and a brother came to him and he said he
[2:10:08] goes have you ever thought about doing
[2:10:10] mission work i said yeah i think i would
[2:10:12] like it so he took me on my first
[2:10:15] mission trip

[2:10:18] started blessing me in my work in my in
[2:10:21] my income in my life
[2:10:23] and
[2:10:24] always wanted to travel the world by
[2:10:27] god's grace he's allowed me to do that
[2:10:29] he's given me the desire of my heart
[2:10:31] because i found a secret that by
[2:10:33] praising god
[2:10:36] that seed that he placed down inside me
[2:10:39] it grew and it grew and it grew now i'm
[2:10:42] getting to be an old man i don't know
[2:10:43] how much longer i'll be here

[2:11:55] you can start singing again you can
[2:11:58] start testifying again you know brother
[2:12:00] random said the world today is trying to
[2:12:02] figure out trying to understand what it
[2:12:05] is that brings the transformation in a
[2:12:08] christian's life that's what your
[2:12:09] prophet said
[2:12:11] what is it they they're trying to find
[2:12:13] out that changes them and changes their
[2:12:16] life he said they will never understand
[2:12:19] it because they refuse to accept the one
[2:12:22] that does the transformation
[2:12:25] he said they refuse to accept their
[2:12:27] transformer himself
[2:12:29] they will never understand it until they
[2:12:32] come and accept the transformer himself
[2:12:34] and church is just a simple thing to do
[2:12:37] if you're a young person here you know
[2:12:39] just do what acts 2 38 says accept what
[2:12:42] it says do what it says and claim the

[2:20:25] darkness with everything that is
[2:20:27] happening around us so
[2:20:29] we know that the darkest hour of the
[2:20:32] night come just before the break of day
[2:20:34] brother branham said this and i want to
[2:20:36] i want to share that with you tonight uh
[2:20:38] in light of what i would rather preach
[2:20:40] tonight that uh if the if the saints
[2:20:42] report that i called up let's read it
[2:20:43] together verb
[2:20:45] said this he says but it will come
[2:20:49] that
[2:20:50] in his in in his promise for this age
[2:20:54] we are living in the age
[2:20:57] that his coming will be in
[2:21:00] she must be identified in him
[2:21:03] praise the lord
[2:21:05] amen
[2:21:06] uh ignoring who you are is is not enough
[2:21:10] like our brother said to talk you know
[2:21:12] to know yourself as a church member but
[2:21:14] this bride will be identified in him
[2:21:17] he says
[2:21:18] any woman must be identified with her
[2:21:21] husband
[2:21:22] for the two to be one
[2:21:24] and christ's bride has to be identified
[2:21:27] with him
[2:21:28] for the two to be one
[2:21:30] praise the lord
[2:21:32] and he is the word
[2:21:34] not the denomination
[2:21:36] the word
[2:21:38] we are to be children of the light
[2:21:43] amen
[2:21:45] and the light
[2:21:47] is the word
[2:21:49] which is made light
[2:21:52] for this age
[2:21:54] i want to read that again
[2:21:57] the light
[2:22:01] is the word
[2:22:03] which is mid light for this age
[2:22:07] how do we know
[2:22:09] light
[2:22:10] except
[2:22:12] it comes from
[2:22:14] the word
[2:22:16] the word may flesh
[2:22:20] is the light
[2:22:22] of the age
[2:22:25] when you see it
[2:22:27] amen
[2:22:30] praise the lord
[2:22:32] if you don't see it it's not light
[2:22:35] praise the lord hi can you say i see
[2:22:37] there is light and you don't see it
[2:22:43] praise the lord
[2:22:44] now when god said let there be light
[2:22:47] he said it
[2:22:49] but until the light appeared
[2:22:52] it was not light that's right
[2:22:54] it was just a spoken word
[2:22:59] when the light appeared
[2:23:01] whether it took
[2:23:03] thousands of years like brother branham
[2:23:05] would say right right
[2:23:07] but god has spoken it
[2:23:10] praise the lord
[2:23:12] and i believe that's that's what our
[2:23:13] brother was speaking about tonight you
[2:23:16] know uh uh uh he he talks about muhammad
[2:23:19] ali being called you know the prophet of
[2:23:22] of of boxing
[2:23:24] there was a secret that
[2:23:26] ali had
[2:23:28] and and his secret was every time he
[2:23:30] comes against his opponent they fight
[2:23:33] and you know the boxers laying laying on
[2:23:35] one another
[2:23:36] he said into the ear of his opponent i'm
[2:23:39] the greatest
[2:23:41] then he gets back into fighting as soon
[2:23:44] as he laid on his he said i'm the
[2:23:46] greatest so he says that and it plays on
[2:23:49] the mind he says oh my god this guy is
[2:23:51] the greatest i got to fight
[2:23:53] he come closer he says i'm the greatest
[2:23:57] lord praise the lord
[2:23:59] and you have to say that to the devil
[2:24:01] i'm the bride of jesus christ
[2:24:03] praise the lord
[2:24:05] when he pushed you to the wall said
[2:24:07] devil i'm the bride of jesus christ
[2:24:10] that was the secret of muhammad ali
[2:24:12] that's why they call him the prophet of
[2:24:13] boxing
[2:24:15] amen
[2:24:16] he whispered in the ear of his opponent
[2:24:18] i'm the greatest
[2:24:20] then that god is fighting oh my goodness
[2:24:22] i got to beat this guy
[2:24:24] amen
[2:24:26] praise the lord but like brother branham
[2:24:28] said
[2:24:29] you know uh
[2:24:30] uh the word mid-flesh
[2:24:33] is light
[2:24:35] when you see it that's a very powerful
[2:24:37] statement
[2:24:39] very powerful
[2:24:41] and and and the thought that is behind
[2:24:43] it is that
[2:24:45] god
[2:24:46] has
[2:24:47] given you promise
[2:24:50] and until you see it
[2:24:53] not not that you read it
[2:24:55] until you see it
[2:24:57] that this promise is yours and for you
[2:25:00] to see it and identify with it that's
[2:25:03] the word me flesh
[2:25:06] yes sir
[2:25:08] if you just read it it's the word it's a
[2:25:10] promise
[2:25:13] but when you identify with it
[2:25:16] when you see it that this thing is
[2:25:18] speaking about me
[2:25:21] then that promise now has become flesh
[2:25:25] somebody has taken the word and has
[2:25:28] dressed themselves with it
[2:25:32] praise the lord and i mean that's what
[2:25:34] we should be doing every service
[2:25:36] reaching out and taking the promise and
[2:25:38] dressing i was saying all this is my
[2:25:40] praise the lord this is mine praise the
[2:25:43] lord this is mine
[2:25:45] it's not sitting down there and just
[2:25:47] watching some kind of a movie like the
[2:25:49] preacher is an artist just to entertain
[2:25:52] you you must be reaching out for the
[2:25:54] promise lord this is mine praise the
[2:25:57] lord i believe it's mine i believe your
[2:25:59] word can transform my life your word can
[2:26:02] break my habits
[2:26:03] your word can deliver me your word can
[2:26:06] bring healing
[2:26:08] the word
[2:26:09] may flesh
[2:26:11] is the light of the day when you see it
[2:26:15] you have to see it
[2:26:21] praise the lord
[2:26:23] let's stand on our feet tonight
[2:26:27] let's just buy our hatch

[2:28:59] done
