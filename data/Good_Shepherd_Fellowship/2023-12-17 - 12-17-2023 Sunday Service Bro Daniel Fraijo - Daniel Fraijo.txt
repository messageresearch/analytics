this morning and also to be able to see his grace and uh Glory upon our faces the Lord bless you have your [Music] seat praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen amen we want to thank the Lord uh for all his goodness his grace and mercy praise the lord we just just got in this morning from uh uh Atlanta fluing and just got ready for church immediately so uh uh we were away on the weekend like we told you on Wednesday night for sister Jim wedding they had a good wedding so we thank the Lord for that and uh we also saw a few of the brothers that sent their greetings and uh right after service uh like we announced on Wednesday night we'll have uh uh the children young people we have their their little meeting with with brother Ariel now what uh what I think is all about uh I know I was hinting so I'm not guessing I'm not Discerning I'm just on it I don't have all of the details so that's what I'm saying what I think it is I think over the over the years uh brother uh through the year brother a been scheduling uh tip playing with the young people and then uh uh coming out with uh with a quest after the listening to a tape and then he he question them so I think uh uh they have just gone through their last step and uh uh so I think there something they want to do with them after the service but if you remember at the beginning of uh uh that whole series we we encourage you parents uh uh especially with the little ones to be able to make time and uh uh either follow up with them or listening you know with them just to be able to create uh that atmosphere or create a form of edication that will be able to help them uh uh in uh listening to the message of the hour we know uh everything that is happening out there we don't want to go into the fces and everything that is going on around but we also have to realize that we have this responsibility as as parents according to the book of Deuteronomy Moses told the children of Israel going into the promised land he he Tau the parents their responsibility teach your children you know uh teach your children these uh Commandments of the word of the Lord WR it on your walls write it at your door post write it on your bed and uh uh and and teach them you know it's it's all about creating an atmosphere where the word will be able to find uh uh you know a place in their life so we want to thank uh our brother and his wife for the time that they put into working with uh uh the young people over the years I know there is that this is very common it's very very common for the fact that when people are given responsibility sometimes people watch and see how much the pastor is involved if the pastor is not involved it's not very important if he was if it was important he will be involved and uh uh uh and and and I think that's a wrong thing you know we are not able to do everything that's the reason why we God has given us people that we can trust to be able to to work let's support them let encourage them and uh and I think uh it will be a blessing praise the Lord so we want to thank our brother and his wife and then also uh uh uh brother area we'll be working with uh uh sister Naomi we want to do something uh uh or the the the young people the children want to do something uh for the coming Sunday so uh uh because of that uh we we we just want to put in a little time to get everything together so there will not be service on Wednesday night we will not have our regular service if we will have anything going on we will let you know but uh uh we will make time for some of the practice that they we want to do Wednesday night and then uh uh they will have uh uh their presentation on Sunday with that being said also we will we will encourage you parents if you've been working with your child privately uh maybe singing a song or reading uh a Prem or a scripture and you think that uh you would like them to be part of that it would be good to tell brother Ariel or sister Nomi and then they will need to practice they will need to practice if uh if any of the the children are part of the group they will need to be part of the practice so so we will not surprise ourself on Sunday again there is no service on Wednesday night so we can be able to give them time to uh uh put together whatever presentation that will be showing to us on Sunday that will be for the children there uh uh there the Christmas presentation so uh uh with that being said we want to use this time to greet our visitors uh brother brother David water what a way to to uh come and visit uh I love that you know when when the brother or the sister do not feel like they are a stranger in the house of God praise the Lord and uh that was our brother that sang the special there praise the Lord God bless you Brother David amen it's good to have you visiting with us praise the Lord and then we also have uh uh uh brother Jordan dad and mom uh brother and and and his wife am I right yes visiting with us this morning and uh so uh when you are not home all the time you don't get all the information you know so bear with me this morning and uh but beyond that we also want to say congratulation to brother Jordan and uh uh he completed his studies and I think his graduation was yesterday yeah praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen so we we just want to thank the Lord for that praise the Lord amen amen so brother Jordan Dale will be preaching for us this morning and uh I hope uh I hope you had uh a good breakfast this morning praise the Lord because uh brother Daniel is he's never in the rush and and another good thing about it again is that he keep you awake you know because he's he he he having such a start of bringing the word that you it's hard to sleep under him if you really sleep then you never had a good sleep last night praise the Lord because he keeps he keeps you Al light praise the Lord let's stand on our feet let's sing a song uh and then uh uh we will we

morning you may be seated just for a moment we're thankful to be here and um and for the opportunity to be able to share God's word with all of you here it's always uh a blessed time to share the word with Believers and uh we're grateful to be here grateful for the invitation from our our brother blat and uh also bring greetings from our little church back home in Phoenix Arizona they they gave me permission to come of course we can't leave without permission but so they I do have permission if anyone's wondering yes U this old man pushing 70 has permission to be here not only in my little church but uh but from almighty God yeah you know we look for his permission above all and uh when he gives us the green light go then then then we feel the we we we feel the confidence they will to come and and know that uh he allow us to share something and we realize in the many words we'll speak this morning not everything will be for everyone but we're certainly believing that the holy spirit will have something a measure of something for each and every one of us here so we're thankful to be here this morning and we'd like to minister on a on a topic and and titled it the pattern of God's word and we'll be reading from revelation aans 10 uh 1-7 and just trying by the grace of God to to share it all with you and and though I might call it my Revelation unless God quickens into your hearts it may just be my opinion and that's okay that's okay if you can only receive it as my opinion but whether it's you receive it as my opinion or God gives you more revelation we are certainly looking forward to what God would speak this morning uh if you'll stand with your feet this morning and uh we'll be reading begin reading in Revelations 8 and verse one very familiar scripture to all of us or most of us I would have to say if you're a Bible reader if you're studying the message of this end time of God send a prophet fulfillment of Malachi 4:6 and he's long gone off the scene but there was a there was food laid up and stored up for us in this day and though and though the prophet went out the scene the the god of that Prophet is still with us here this morning Revelations 8 and verse one and it says and when he had opened the seven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning Lord Jesus just a few words and without your leadership your guidance your revelation we would never know the meaning of this but Lord this morning you've opened the book and you've loosed the Seven Seals and we thank you for that we pray Lord that you would open this book and loose these Seven Seals to everyone that it could become a personal experience this morning in Jesus name amen you may be seated I'd like to read a quote here from the message Christ The Mystery of God reveal paragraph 637 it says brother bam says not knowing of course but being spiritual he says you watch spiritual things he says not knowing this God knows it he's finishing up this message he's at the end of it he's preached for many hours already he saids but if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot 2:00 the end of the second pole the third poll is at hand you see in his ministry God had showed him way back in 1946 where he met in a little old cabin and the angel of Lord come down and spoke to him and began to speak to him of the stages and changes in in his ministry and how it would become greater for a little flock called The Bride of Jesus Christ but for the world it would become less interesting all the time for the world they would be they would find it harder and harder to understand but for the Bride of Jesus Christ through Revelation she' be able to recognize her day and its message you could recognize where we are today this day this morning where the word hases Prophet said the third pull was the opening of those Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that that's been sealed in the word the message anointed ones at the end time 1965 believe it's paragraph 262 he said this notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pole was healing the the second PLL prophesying the third poll the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third poll was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word he says do you see it and they didn't see it but the question still is today even more do you you see it this morning there's always been a question of what happened on Sunset Mountain I used to live in a city Tucson Arizona about 3 and 1 half hour drive to Sunset Mountain we've been there many times but it's what happened on Sunset Mountain he he says in the message what is the attraction on the mountain 1965 paragraph 14 8 he said what's happened upon Mount Sunset God confirming his noise that's what all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10: 1-7 now he con now he is connected he has connected for us Revelations 10 1-7 with what happened with a happening on Sunset Mountain connected keep that in mind as we go on notice it's God's fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10: 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10: 1-7 the last message to the last Church fulfills exactly in this age St Luke 1730 the day when the son of man shall be revealed in one paragraph he's connected so many things he's connected Revelations 10:1 to the Mount Sunset experience he's connected re it's connected Luke 17:30 to the Mount Sunset experience he connected the revealing of the son of man in our days to that mount Sunset experience are happening he says and there shall arise false prophets and false Christ show great signs and wonders in so much it deceived the elected if possible the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just as puzzled 1965 it's now 2023 and I dare to say the church is just as puzzled in the message the Feast of the trumpets again the prophets connecting pulling loose ends together for us he says in in this message Feast of the trumpets 1964 paragraph 264 look I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking from the seventh Angel's messenger of the seven seal message in Revelations 10 was the seven seal another connection what was that connection he now told us Revelations 10 1-7 was the seven seal we read a scripture Revelations 81 has maybe 18 words in it we thought that's Hall how can we know what this seven seal is with just 18 Little Words a short little verse ah w we say now he's connected and he said Revelations look I want to say one more thing he said closely now don't miss this how striking the seventh Angels messenger of the seventh seal message in Revelations 10 was the seventh seal how many verses are there in Revelations 10 11 so now a prophet has just added 11 more verses to what is taking place and happening under the seven seal it's no longer just Revelations 81 now it's 11 more vers now we have 12 verses giving us detail of what is the seven seal what's happening under that seal and yet the language itself of the Bible is designed to hide these truths from the eyes of the wise and simple the wise and prudent and reveal it unto to babes such as would learn seals seals seals what is seals well I have in my pocket it's not a very good one but it's the best I could do improvising in brother bl's office the Bible was written in Scrolls and what held the scrolled shut was called a seal and when the seal was [Music] removed that's all the seal was for it was to hold the Scrolls shut and the seal was removed with a soulle purpose to unfold the scroll and reveal the message within yeah and in this message they're fighting over what is seals what is Seal what is seals that's it right there that's it that was the seal but when you loose it it opens the book and it reveals a message a plan a Sevenfold Plan of Redemption of restoration of God coming down to change our lives and The World Keeps fighting over what what is a Seal Seal Seal seals who's speaking about the message the message the message the word of God thus sayith the Lord look I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking from the seventh Angel's messenger of the seventh seal now he's connected the seventh angel as the messenger of the seventh seal message in Revelations 10 was the seventh seal now he's telling us Revelations 10 that's the seventh seal with more detail was the seven seal to the seven trumpets between those two times oh God can we say this how can we say this to make the people see it that revelation 10 was the seven seal back in 1963 I'm met my home there in Tucson just a young boy and uh there's a knock on the door at our home my father opens a door and it was a brother his name was Daniel ramidus and he had with him a little brochure two or three pages at the most it was and it was a it was a brochure of a Science magazine and the man and the scientist that had put it together was called James E MacDonald the issue was April the 19th 1963 he was the leading scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson Arizona and he had put this out during the time when this Myster ious Cloud appeared in the heavens and he writes this an unusual ring-shaped Cloud was widely observed over Northern Arizona near Sunset on 20 the 28th of February 1963 from a large number of absorbers reports it's known to have appeared overhead near Flagstaff Arizona from initial computations based on four photos taken in Tucson 190 Mi south of the cloud its altitude was approximately 35 km as a young boy I'm listening to this brother passionate excited reading this science this no this little brochure from this Science magazine he said the most distant Opera obser observation reported was made 280 mies from the cloud the cloud remained sunlit for 28 minutes after local Sunset iridescence was noted by many observers Tech tentatively the cloud may be regarded as similar to a narus cloud but it's unusually great height unusually low altitude plus its remarkable shape suggests that it was a cloud a previously unrecorded type remember John when he saw the vision and there in Revelations 8 one he says and when he had opened the seven seal he the lamb had opened the seven seal and when he had opened the seven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour I doubt John even knew what the word half an hour meant because they didn't tell time as we tell time today they didn't divide it in the same fashion and yet that was the language that he used that was the language that God wanted him to use that was what God wanted him to say because over 2,000 years later he would cause a scientist to determine exactly how long that was and when we read this report on the Science magazine here this scientist Dr McDonald [Music] he tells us that it was sunlit for 28 minutes science tells us to the minute wow John said it was about the space of a half hour the scientists God has them to testify that's true as a matter of fact we timed it it was exactly 28 minutes God has scientists to testify God rich in Mercy science said it was it was a cloud remarkable shape a cloud of previously unrecorded type scientifically unrecorded of science but recorded in God's holy word if you like turn with me to Acts chapter 1 beginning at verse 7 you remember what was taking place here Jesus had appeared amongst the disciples he had resurrected he had been seen amongst them for 40 days and he was he had just ascended and in Revelations in Acts 1:7 it goes like this and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father have put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon on you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received them out of their sight a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven now we know now we can say This Cloud that Jesus was caught up into it wasn't just a cloud it just just it wasn't formed by D Drops this was seven angels the same seven angels that took them up here is the same seven angels 2,000 years later he come down again to declare it's his second coming oh Lord Isaiah said in Isaiah 289 and 10 Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast them that have come out of apostolic and Pentecostal and Catholic denominations the best they could give them was milk but you can't raise a person to adulthood strong on milk he's got to have meat he must have precept upon precept and blind upon line here a little in a message from 1946 and here a little from a message of 1963 now now we begin that was extra now we're now we're going to get into God's word Revelations 10 and verse 1 and remember what is revelation 10 this is the seventh seal this is details of the happening under the seventh seal so we no longer have just one verse Revelations 81 now we have 12 verses of detail of what would happen at the opening and the process unfolding under this seven seal but is it really the seven seal or is it a seventh message is it a book that's been open to us the Lamb's Book of Life that's what this seven seal is it's a book of life Revelations 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud seven angels on Sunset mountain and a rainbow was upon his head a covenant Angel C himself and his face was it was as it were the son the same son that was above that woman in Revelations 12 John said and I saw a woman great with child I saw her in heaven he said a woman about to have a baby in heaven I I thought there was no babies in heaven you see I'm already getting ready to go off on another subject I'll leave that Revelations 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothe with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left on the foot on the earth the sea that he put his right foot upon is a multitude of peoples a gentile people and his left foot on the Earth was right down on Jerusalem the promised land the Jewish people because he was descending to restore he was descending to make take possession of his people of his bride of his church modern events here being made clear by prophecy to us in the message modern events made clear by prophecy paragraph 61 Prophet says this these Modern event is slipping by us too swiftly and one day we're going to find out we'll be left behind without nothing and be caught sealed into the mark of the beast before we know it now and with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that's promise every one of them must be fulfilled in its age for it foretells the author has before done this just like this Cloud these seven angels on Sunset Mountain you realize now the author had for done this and we wait to see him do it again what a time it is that we're living in like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in you look at God's Bible to see what age we're living in we're not living in a Methodist age the Baptist age we're living in the bright Age The Calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back he promised to do it so Revelations 10 it's the bride age in the message this day the scriptures fulfilled paragraph 175 Prophet says this and I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed it to revealed it I said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in jesus' name and all these things has been revealed but there's secrets that hid inside because the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals I must go there to find it oh we ought to have that same feeling in our hearts when we read these things I too must go there to find it I too must meditate on his word night and day to find it amen you can find it because it's a promise to you he said that morning when those seven angels came down and blasted the Earth rocks flew everywhere seven angels stood there and said return back to Jeffersonville from where you came from for the Seven Seals of the seven Mysteries will be open it was 1974 and for the first time I went to Sunset Mountain you're no longer allowed to go there it's all closed down now new new owners that know not Joseph how haveit now but when I when I walked into that area and a prophet said it was a blast and it looked like a blade had just chopped everything to one high you could go there almost 10 years later 9 years later and those trees still were all like they'd been cut at the same Hive he said here we are today understanding serpent SE in a few days of God willing will understand the correctness of marriage and divorce 1965 he said here we are we're understanding serpent seed but not all in 2023 in a few days if God willing will'll understand the correctness of marriage and divorce but not all in 2023 when a prophet preached marriage and divorce the truth of it lays in the mouth of three Witnesses Moses Jesus and the Apostle Paul and how beautifully God used the seventh angel to tie it together all these things that God has opened every seal the mystery since the foundation of the world and we've been enjoying the presence of his Blessing that is true he says and then he says this day this scriptures fulfilled he said 1965 February the 19th this day it's now 2023 we ought to have this revelation we ought to lay in the word till we get it in the message the breach 1963 paragraph 39 now it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows it God Alone Jesus Christ see it's a book A mysterious book it's the book of redemption we'll get into that a little while and now we know that this book of redemption will not thoroughly be understood it's probed that through six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends that these fellows probed it and the Mysteries come down from God as the word of God reveals the ti revelation of God then the godhead and everything else is settled all the Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed now you see I'm not just making that up it's thus saith the Lord he says I'll read it out of the book for you I'm reading out of the book today but it'll still require the Lamb of God the revealer to Open the Eyes of your understanding to see it he said I read it out of the book The sounding of the seventh angel message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who wrote the word at the sounding of the seven Church age the last Church AG all the Loose Ends that's through these Church ages have been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the Mysteries revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember there seventh Angels on the earth at the time of his coming let me read that again and when the Seven Seals are broke the Mysteries [Music] revealed where's the seal where's the message ought to be in our hearts Seven Seals is the book sealed I'll just make the statements and let let brother blatte fix it all later Seven Seals is the book sealed seven Thunders is the book revealed but Seven Virtues is the book living EP pistols read of all men in you and I it's a process and God doesn't want to stay at the top he wants to bring it to this book B is in you Christ in you the hope of glory and when the seals are brok the Mysteries revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ that's Revelations 10:1 setting his foot upon the land setting his foot upon the sea putting his foot me means possession he's come to possess this Gentile bride he's come to possess His People Israel with a rainbow over his head a angel a covant angel now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of his coming so what is Revelations 10 Revelations 10 a prophet said it's the seven seal Revelations 10 he said it's the time of the Bride age Revelations 10 he just told us it's his coming Revelations 10 is when the Seven Seals of God were opened there on the mountain he told us he said Revelations 10 it's the third pool Revelations 10 and the Seven Seals of God he said the question is when were they really open for the day aha I'm glad you asked me that question here it is in the message then inv visible Union of the bride of Christ just a month before brother Brandon passed away it was November the 25th paragraph 301 and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened there on the mountain now a book open doesn't mean it's a book revealed but it's open to be revealed to whosoever will to whosoever will meditate on this word night and day and the Seven seals of God when it was opened there on the mountain February 1963 let God he said no let me die right now at this Pulpit if that ain't the truth he said and I for told you and I for told you I told you a year and six months before it happened what he told me go to Arizona and what would happen out there in the desert and there's men sitting right here tonight was standing right there and present when the seven angels came down and even the magazine Life Magazine packed the article of it it's right there in the observatory and everything now they don't even know what it's all about Life Magazine packed the article it's right there in the observatory and everything and in 20123 most of this message movement they don't even know what it's on all about invisible Union of the bride of Christ the cloud was photographed February the 28th 1963 March the 17th 1963 William Brandon Begins the sounding of the seventh Angels M Ministry he begins it with God and simplicity the sounding he had his first po Ministry Evangelistic prayed for the sick but the sounding of his ministry had not begun there he had discernment Discerning the hearts of the people he told us himself how he had misused it improperly and it bothered him greatly that he had then we come to the third pool of his ministry So This Cloud that was photographed seven angels the same seven angels that were present when Jesus was caught up away am the first coming of Christ now they come again the second coming of Christ This Cloud was photographed on February the 28th 1963 March the 17th of 1963 will brandham Begins the sounding of the seventh angel Ministry with God and simplicity March the 24th he preaches the seven seal from the time the Angels appeared in the mountain to the time he preached the seven seal was 25 days so from the appearing of the cloud to the preaching of the Seven Seals 25 days so from Revelations 101 to Revelations 10:7 the unfolding and the Fulfillment takes place in 25 days no brother brandom it had to have been years no surely it was 20 years surely it took all his ministry for this to unfold no we're talking about the sounding of this message the prophetic part not the Evangelistic part you say it can't be I say is anything too hard for the Lord am in the message the first seal 1963 paragraph 195 he says now then reformers know that there was something wrong Luther knowed that that that bread wasn't the body of of Christ so he preached the just shall live by faith we must still preach the just shall live by faith and that was his message and when John le Wesley came along he saw that there was sanctification so he preached sanctification we must still preach sanctification and Holiness and hold up hold it up high before the people this is your goal not fornication not adulter sanctification Holiness so he preached sanctification that was his message see the Pentecostals brought in the message of the Holy Ghost and so forth and we still preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost but in these last days and this last age the messenger is not to start any Reformation but is to take all the Mysteries that these reformers left off gather them together solve them to the the people let me just read it again it sounds so good to me I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow upon his head and his face the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we saw the same thing which was Christ and we know Christ is always the messenger where did we see the same thing on Sunset Mountain we saw the same thing we saw the pattern of his word on folding we know Christ is always the messenger of the church all right he's called the pillar of fire the angel of the Covenant and so forth and he had in his hand a little book open now the seals had done been broke here where he's reading from the scriptures then he says 1963 March 18th preaching on the first seal he says now the seals had been broke here in the prophecy then he says we're breaking them now this thing is open Revelations 10 and verse3 and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not you see brother Daniel it's not even written how can we even attempt to know what it could be it's not written so let's just close that page though it wasn't a r written word it has never ceased to be the spoken word was it a spoken word seven Thunders uttered their voices spoken word God told John don't write it but he won't draw back what he has said and his word will never return void to him God said in the beginning say the Earth was void without form Darkness was upon the face of the deep and God said let there be light and there was light the spoken word did that you said yeah brother I I I've read it that's Genesis verse 1 and two but you understand that that wasn't written until 2500 years later when Moses was given the vision did the lack of it being written hinder God's word from coming to pass no sir he spoke it it was time it was season it happened God then 25 200 years later God said go ahead Moses write it for a history to the church to my people so when they read it they can learn to see there's a pattern in my word what kind of pattern a pattern like Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in the me in the first seal Prophet said this paragraph 263 he says we found what the thunder means that's perfectly we know that see then what did he say why just he told you we found what the Thunder is we know what what it is someone tell me what is it no let me share it we found what the thunder means the prophet said that's perfectly we know that see the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened the Thunder a symbol like the seal a symbol the Thunder was the voice of God when a seal is opened so what would seven Thunders be the opening of Seven Seals in the message in questions and answers number four 1964 they asked him a question number 395 have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed it's 1964 now were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are not yet known to us as the Thunders yet no he says they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders that uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed can the seventh angel is a messenger of the seven Church age See Seven Seals that's what seven Thunders was all about because a thunder is the voice of God when a seal opened now think in your minds historically to 1963 and God sends a Prophet back to Jeffersonville Indiana and he says I went I'd go I'd be in that little room where I was studying he says and the angel would come down and he'd say pick up your pen and write what was that angel telling him he was telling him what he forbade John to write but John Couldn't Write was being told to that prophet in 1963 seven times seven Thunders Hallelujah because a thunder is the voice of God when a seal was open Seven Seals the bride age Seven Seals it is the bride age the Revelation Seven Seals it's say coming to the bride Seven Seals it's a sounding of the seventh angel Seven Seals it's his third pole Ministry Seven Seals it's the revealing of the word Seven Seals it's heart turning time not information not education Revelation a personal experience with the father made possible through the blood of Jesus Christ did you know seven Thunders is what will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers listen to this an exposition in in the message the exposition of the seven Church ages he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally will turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so but consider this also this Prophet Messenger will be in his nature and his manners as Elijah and John the people of this Prophet messenger's day will be as they were in ahab's day and in John's and says it's only the children and since it's only the children whose Hearts will be turned it's only the children who will listen in the days of Ahab only 7,000 true seed is Israelites were found in the days of John there were also very few the masses in both Ages were in the fornication of idolatry even as we see [Music] today you just lost a lot of friends brother the Daniel well I know I pray for him listen to this the message standing the Gap 1963 well it happens to be that at least one man is present this morning who was standing there when it happened speaking on Sunset Mountain it actually shook the Rocks off the mountain we find out that during that time I saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid swept down and picked me up and I was brought East to open the Seven Seals for God what part of any of those statements failed what part of any of those statements did God not keep what part was he unable to keep he kept it all and I was brought East to open the Seven Seals for God and if you haven't got them if Jesus terries my great grandchildren little Paul's children there will still be he said that will still be the Eternal truth of the Living God now that was to find out what was sealed inside this mountain he's talking of the vision now that wasn't wrot it had to be interpreted and when I come back and when I came back the first angel on the first night opened the seal contrary to anything we ever heard in our life you remember when he preached the first seal he said if it hadn't have been about noon today when the angel came down I would have got it all wrong I would have said it all wrong none of it would have been right but he came down am said and when I come back the first angel on the first night open the seal contrary to anything we've ever heard in our life and all same and all seven came out the same way you know that you were here present when it happened many of you and the message is this the sign of the answer paragraph 3:14 Prophet says this now when he begins to sound he's quoting Revelations 10:7 now huh now when he begins to sound the mystery will be finished now note then it's time for the seven seal voices of Revelations 10 to be revealed now he's connecting Revelations 10:7 with Revelations 10:4 and the Seven Thunders one one and the same now when he begins to sound the mystery will be finished now note then it's time for the seven seal voices of Revelations 10 to be revealed do you understand congregation says amen but they didn't understand wasn't the season it wasn't their time but it is your time and this is the season amen hallelujah you say you don't understand brother Daniel I'm I'm not educated neither was William brandham neither was John the Baptist I don't think Jesus went one day of school in his life it's not education it's Revelation education actually hinders us education actually robs us now you go ahead and get your education but if you don't balance it with the word the education will get you so Revelations 10 what is it a prophet told us Revelations 10 it's the seventh seal Revelations 10 what is it Revelations 10 it's the bride age Revelations 10 what is it he told us it's his coming not the first it's the second Revelations 10 it's when the Seven Seals were opened there on the mountain February the 28th 1963 so now you can write Revelations 101 and then put February the 28th 1963 this day this scripture fulfilled Hallelujah who else can do that but the Bride of Jesus Christ and to whom the lamb will give Revelation oh the book is a living book Revelations 10 it's when the seventh angel begins to sound March the 18th 1963 now you can write Revelations 10:7 March 18th 1963 put it that date down like the day you gave your heart to Jesus Christ October the 8th 1974 I was tired of running I left home at 16 I thought I'd return back to California Los Angeles Bakersville I thought I could run away from God took me many steps to get there but God took one and he was there right at my side Revelations 10 verse5 and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the Earth and the things that there are and the Sea the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and the question came up did Time [Music] end when the seals was preached questions and answers number three 1964 they asked him a question now if time ceases when the seals were open he said excuse me if time ceased when the seals were open then the Millennium also then the Millennium is also finished is it not Prophet said no no no time didn't cease when the seals were open misunderstood it what happened is the Myer was revealed not time ceased see just look watch real close now and and we play your tape if you got it from a tape see they always get it from the tape they even get it wrong when they get it from the tape because it it requires Revelation requires sincerity requires a humble heart not what I know but what I want to know Lord Jesus time never ceased this must be a post millennial or something that ask the question because you see we got a thousand years after the church has gone home and comes back upon the Earth then time ceases and the new heavens and new earth now the Millennium is not the new heavens and new earth there will still be sin after the Millennium the Millennium is a type of Noah going in the ark and carried over and brought ham and them under the side and sin even came out of the Ark see see Hallelujah Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to servants the prophets Revelations 10 is when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that followed the healing service you say are you sure you got a quote for that brother Daniel I'm glad you asked I do in the message I have heard but now I see 1965 he said now we're promised that church age through reformers and we've had them but he promised in Malachi 4 he'd keep his pattern in the last days of what would took place the word of God is full of patterns by which we can gain Revelation and know the truth truth he said he'd keep his pattern in the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers for that very purpose and the church is so broke up in denominations and isms it so tore to Pieces till it's dead sounds like 2023 doesn't it it's been a carrier and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angels message the Seven Seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared revelation 10 he says when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that followed the healing service 1963 the message that following in the Rapture 1965 paragraph 108 now there's a messenger above always and a messenger on Earth the English word angel means a messenger and the seventh angels message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry then when he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started Jesus when he started out now he's taking us to the pattern of the word again not just telling us this is how I did it no he's also saying now watch when Jesus started out because the pattern of the second coming is the pattern of the first Jesus when he started out he started Healing The Sick and afflict him oh that great Rabbi he's a prophet everybody wanted him in his church but when he set one down down when he sat down one day and said I and my father are one that was different and except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man of course we understand it was a parable except you eat the Flesh of the son of man so the flesh represented something not flesh can drink his blood and the blood represented something not blood you have no life in you so Seven Seals were preached March the 17th 1963 beginning with God in Simplicity it was 10 services in 8 days and on March 24th 1963 he preaches the seven seal keep in mind that what he said in these eight Services was this much about those Seven Seals but what he said from the time he preached them in ' 63 to when God took him in 65 the Revelation grew like this that's right because it was the third poll Ministry that had begun there and continued to unfold so from Revelations 101 to Revelations 10:7 we see now it was fulfilled in 25 days what has been begun is the ministry of the sounding of the seventh angel the third pole Ministry continues to 1965 the revealing of the word until God takes his prophet in an automobile accident December the 24th 1965 and the message of the seventh angel is completed and then we're challenged and said oh no no it ain't because I don't know understand this and I don't understand this and I don't understand this and I don't understand this and the reason many don't understand it because they're busy getting a education Okay the reason they don't understand it because they're watching too many YouTube videos okay and the reason they don't understand it is because they're playing too many games and the re huh the year's 1962 the message is is this the sign of the answer in paragraph 297 he said the book that is written within is then completed is then completed when this Angel ceases he says I'm giving you a sign and when you watch when this Angel ceases when he passes away you know what that means God was successful again amen God kept his word promise made promise kept God kept his word amen when the seventh angels He says the book that is written within is then completed when this Angel ceases he says now please understand this he said when the seventh Angel's message is completed the godhead Ministry mystery the serpent seed mystery all the other mysteries of all these things we have these divinely revealed mystery truths to share with one another in God's people if we'll get into the word in the message influence 196 63 it's November the 30th Prophet says what did John the Baptist do the man that Jesus said there was never a man born of a woman like him or could compare with him until that time the great prophet ordained of God before the foundation of the world spoke of 127 years before he ever come on or 712 years rather before he ever came on the Earth by the prophet Isaiah what did he do when he seen a man come walking down out of the audience and he looked up above and saw that fire coming down from heaven in the form of a dove he cried he cried out I have need to be baptized Of Thee I must decrease then a prophet says I must decrease he must increase God can't have two on the earth at the same time you know there's not two on the earth now so there must be something prophetic happening something that we're seeing or maybe something we're not seeing something that we should see God can't have two under Earth at the same time only one has the message you know I must decrease he says he is the messenger it's the end of 1963 and a prophet of God says I must decrease then he says he's the messenger no no no wa brother Bram you're the messenger you're the one you're the messenger he says I must decrease he's the messenger I've been up to this [Music] time 1963 the end of the year now he takes my place as Elisha when Elijah went up and throw back his robe to Elisha his ministry was finished Elisha must take up who he left off he must increase I must decrease says like John the Baptist he says now revealing something that he is experiencing he's now he's revealing something but in Simplicity paragraph 111 he says be conscious of your little you know why cuz he was feeling very conscious of his littleness he prayed for the sick crippled walk blind saw the dead were raised my parents had a good friend her name was Rosie they were living in California at the time in Los Angeles she was diagnosed with terminal cancer they said just go home and die the growth had already on her neck become protruding nothing we can do for you but that night she got a prayer guard she went in the line Prophet took her by the hand so the doctors have told you this and this you can't live it's terminal that's what that growth on your neck is a parents had he prayed for her and the growth fell off and she live but listen to this she didn't go on in her latter years serving the [Music] lord where are the multitudes that were healed in the prayer lines most are all dead except those to whom Jesus Christ became real except those those who were born again except those who got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're not dead they're sleeping in Christ it's not the healing of the body but it's the healing of that Soul it's the quickening power within you after the Forerunner has left the scene who is the messenger follow the pattern the Holy Spirit Christ in his bride as he was in his prophet and what follows a ministerial change from a one- man Ministry to the ministry of a many membered body that's the pattern that's the pattern that's right you remember the parable of the rich man and the poor beggar Lazarus Lazar Nazareth died a beggar on the streets the Bible says a host of angels came and took him to the bosom of Abraham to that Fifth Dimension because the Fifth Dimension was in two parts with a Chasm breached between the two one side was a waiting place for the righteous the other side is hell a place of Torment a prison house both awaiting Judgment Day when the rich man was in hell he lifted up his eyes he could see Lazarus blessed peaceful not hungry no more not dirty no more not torn clothing anymore he said Father Abraham let him dip with his finger just a little bit of water he says no there's a Chasm here we can't cross to your side you can't come to us he says I've got family I've got Brothers on the other side he says send Lazarus no Lazarus can't return raise up one of the prophets from the dead to go back and tell my brethren he says even if I was to raise a prophet and send him they would not believe him they have Moses in the law amen amen even if William brand raised again they would not believe they don't they're not believing him now and they claim to be reading and hearing the tapes every day no remember what he said I must decrease William brandham I must decrease he is the messenger I've been up to this time now he takes my place the words of a prophet it's November the 30th 1963 and he can feel the pull and he can see the fornication of ID of idolatry in the people already but what was to follow is not God bringing back a prophet whom Jesus in the parable said even if I was to raise one from the dead you would not believe him that Parable is there for a purpose that nugget is laying there for a reason Revelations 10 and8 and the voice which I heard from heaven Heaven spoke unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey let me read verse eight again Holy Spirit telling me read it again and the voice which I heard from Heaven John speaking here spake unto me again and said and go and take the little book from the hand of the seventh angel he didn't say that it doesn't say that let's read what it does say and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth each and every one of you me included we need a personal experience with Jesus Christ the Lamb of God verse 9 and I went unto the angel said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand it's an open book now and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings the bride of Christ you and I we must prophesy of the hope that lays in our hearts of this Born Again experience Seven Seals it's seven parts of one Plan of Redemption for the bride tree and the fig tree listen to this Revelations 5 number two 1961 he said and this Sevenfold book of book of seven Redemptive plans has been brought to us and that's what this book holds now we're going to get over into the 10th chapter where this Mighty Angel proclaims something and he had a little book that John had to eat and when he did he got it into his belly it was bitter but in his lips it was sweet when you have to digest it it gets a bitter everybody's against you everybody's telling you're a Holy Roller you're this you're that see you're off your head so it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweeten your lips that's all see and when you stand up in a meeting you say glory to God hallelujah when you're going to the great Siege it's hard but when you're out of that great Siege you can testify it then it sweep in the lips that's right that's this book of redemption now I'm going to share with you how Revelation comes where it starts and how you can receive it who wants to know this is where it begins for each and every one of us acts 237 now when they heard this preaching of this Revelations 10 1-7 the Seven Seals they were pricked in their heart you say whoa brother Daniel they no they never heard in that day did you ever hear brother brandham say when he preached The Sixth Seal we're going to do something different now he says I want you open your Bible to Revelation 61 and turn and open to Matthew 24 and I'm going to show you how Jesus preached to them the Seven Seals in a parable that's right in a parable so now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart acts 237 said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do they were pricked in their hearts because Peter had spoke to them he had spoke to them harshly right he seen in that multitude of people men who had stood that day before pontious Pilot's court and yelled with all the rest of the Jews who were there crucify him and now they're standing here at this day on the day of Pentecost hearing 120 speak in their native tongues and understanding every word they're saying and now they realize a great error they had done now they realize in their ignorance what they had done John crucified the Lord Of Glory and Peter says now therefore let all the house of Israel no assurity that God had made that same Jesus whom ye crucified he's talking to a large multitude of people and they saying do you understand now what you've done this Jesus whom whom you crucified is both Lord and Christ when they heard this knowing the things they had said about this message knowing the way they've been living lately when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and we should be and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren I'm guilty this morning of things I shouldn't be in but what shall I do I've been secretly doing stuff I shouldn't and the word is pricked my heart this morning hanging out with the wrong school friends being on the wrong sides speaking things you couldn't speak to feel more accepted and not rejected and they were pricked in their hearts he said men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of these sins that perhaps even followed you through that door this morning and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's taking a step forward to become part of the seven-part [Music] plan that's designed to restore you to justify you to sanctify you to fill you with the Holy Ghost and when you need it are refilling you see when I was in the Apostolic Church amongst the Pentecostal people you had to speak in tongues or you didn't have the Holy Ghost but then you spoke in tongues and you knew you weren't living right but you couldn't tell anyone to get some help because it was too shameful CU you'd already spoken tongues and supposedly you had it all then right that's all you needed you're good don't worry about it but we realize we weren't good and we were worried about it God rich in Mercy wants to baptize you with his Holy Ghost and if you get into a problem he wants to give you a refilling of that Holy Spirit you see because the refilling of the spirit in your life is not a re re wward for being a good guy or a good gal uh-uh no the refilling of the Holy Ghost is not a reward because all of a sudden you are so good this week no no no the refilling of the Holy Ghost is to give you the strength to overcome a hard trial feeling after refilling after refilling till th cup runneth over then it's rapturing time were quick and changed and translated by the power of His holy spirit this end time message this end time word this revelation of these Seven Seals is to take us unto Perfection that's the truth that's what the pro that's what Jesus preached when he preached on Perfection you know that right Matthew 5:48 I'm closing them I got a lot more to say but I'm closing them Matthew 5:48 Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect talking to one of the associes pastors at a big mega church in the city we live congregations of five six 7,000 people I was doing some work at his home and he said Dan you're a Believer I said I am indeed we get to talking on the word of God and I say and I read this scripture for him name was ber said Bert aren't you happy to know that God said we can be perfect because he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect he says oh Dan I sense a lot of Calvinism in you he says I said you do but I'm really 50% calvinist and 50% arenium I'm right in the middle I said he said we can't be perfect no such thing I said could it be we've misinterpreted the word in this Parable that Jesus spoke that it's symbolic of something and not a literal statement I said said let me leave you something to think on B and I'll leave you folks to something to think on be ye therefore perfect Matthew 5:48 even as your father which is in heaven is perfect do you know why he said be ye therefore because of the previous 47 verses that he took the time to preach on Perfection and he told us the first step of how to arrive and I'll share the first step as a brother who'll take this place would come forward Jesus in Matthew 51 says and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poorn spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven you see that's where we all start blessed are the born Spirit born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies full of complexes maybe you're not maybe it's just me full of complexes poor in spirit like Sarah was Sarah was a woman poor in spirit but she loved God but the complexes of Life her maid making fun of her she couldn't have a child Sarah was a woman porn Spirit loved God believed God but Satan had beat her down to a place to convince her God can do anything but he's not going to do anything with you
