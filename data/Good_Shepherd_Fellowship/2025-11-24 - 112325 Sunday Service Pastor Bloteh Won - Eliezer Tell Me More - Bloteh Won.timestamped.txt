[51:11] bit anxious to tell you what is what is
[51:14] on my heart this morning. Praise the

[51:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. I I wanted to make some comment but

[51:41] the Lord. Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's don't don't start
[51:45] worrying now. Don't panic. I just I
[51:48] wanted to say something to appreciate
[51:49] you. But I will say it to you privately.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; So Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; You know when the pastor say I want to
[51:57] see you then you start worrying. Nothing
[51:59] bad, nothing wrong happen.
[52:04] Deuteronomy chapter 6. Let's read from
[52:06] verse one. Now these are the
[52:09] commandments, the statutes, the judgment
[52:11] which the Lord God commanded to teach
[52:13] you, that ye might do them in the land
[52:17] whether ye go to possess it, that thou
[52:21] may fear the Lord thy God to keep all
[52:23] his statutes and his commandment
[52:26] which I command thee thou and thy son
[52:30] and thy son's son all the days of thy
[52:34] life and that thou that they may be
[52:38] prolonged. Yeah. Therefore, O Israel,
[52:43] and observe to do it, that it may be
[52:46] well with thee, and that ye may increase
[52:49] mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers
[52:55] have promised thee, in the land that
[52:57] flowth with milk and honey. Here, O
[53:01] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[53:09] with all thine heart, with all thy soul,
[53:14] and with all thy might. Praise the Lord.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, in the name
[53:20] of Jesus, we just want to ask blessing
[53:23] upon your word. And we just pray that
[53:25] Father speak to us in your own way this
[53:28] morning.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; The things that concern us Lord and
[53:31] concern us our walk in this life. We
[53:34] pray that God something will be said of
[53:36] internal value that will draw us closer
[53:38] to you in Jesus name we pray.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You have your
[53:42] seat. Just want to uh like I said titled
[53:46] our little talk this morning tell me
[53:49] more. Amen.
[53:51] Ela tell me more. Now Wednesday night we
[53:54] were speaking on uh love project and
[53:58] that's that's the same direction we want
[54:00] to go in but the the title EA tell me
[54:04] more has my inspiration so that's the
[54:06] reason why I'm titling it ea tell me
[54:10] more good to see you Danny you look
[54:12] sharp
[54:15] here praise the lord
[54:18] amen
[54:20] and uh so uh uh but uh I subject
[54:23] actually was uh how can we love the Lord
[54:26] with all of our heart and all of our
[54:29] soul and all of our mind and all of our
[54:32] strength. How can we do it? How can God
[54:35] tell uh a rebellious people a people
[54:38] whose heart was in Egypt they were ready
[54:41] to go back to Egypt for garlic? I don't
[54:44] know how many of you can eat garlic
[54:48] very acidic. That's what they wanted to
[54:50] go. that the only thing they complaining
[54:52] about the garlic of Egypt.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh uh and I mean their heart
[55:03] was in Egypt.
[55:05] They were not converted. And yet God is
[55:08] giving them his commandment. Thou shall
[55:10] love the Lord with all of your heart and
[55:12] all of your mind, all of your soul. How
[55:14] can how can they do it? How could they
[55:17] do it? How can we do it?
[55:20] Praise the Lord.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "Nobody can come unto
[55:24] the father except the father draws him."
[55:27] But yet he says in his word, "Draw nigh
[55:30] unto God
[55:32] &gt;&gt; and he would draw you." So who's doing
[55:34] the drawing?
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; If nobody can come except the father
[55:41] draw, so the father has to be the one
[55:44] drawing first.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know how you did this
[55:49] thing. He's pulling my ears off.
[55:54] Maybe when I take this off, it might
[55:56] help me. The father have to do the
[55:59] drawing.
[56:01] If nobody can come except the father
[56:03] draw first,
[56:06] then there is no way we can draw night
[56:08] unto God until he draw night unto us.
[56:12] Now, it's just like this. is like the
[56:14] fisherman. When he throw his line in the
[56:18] water,
[56:20] there's a bait. The fish gets the bite,
[56:24] but he don't allow the fish to sense
[56:27] that he's on the line.
[56:30] If the fish sense it, it will start
[56:32] fighting. So, what he does is that he
[56:34] give enough line
[56:37] so the fish can think it's normal
[56:40] and it's swimming. So then he pulls a
[56:43] little bit to bring the fish closer.
[56:47] Praise the Lord.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; The fish thing is drawing nigh to the
[56:51] shore. But there is a line that is
[56:53] talking it.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; So there is no way we can draw nigh unto
[56:57] God until
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; He draw nigh unto us.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Until he's drawing, until he's doing the
[57:07] pulling.
[57:09] is God that is doing the talking for us
[57:11] to come closer.
[57:14] Are we together?
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to sell my thoughts to you so
[57:17] you'll be able to grab it early where we
[57:19] going this morning. So, how can we love
[57:22] the Lord with all of our heart when the
[57:25] heart is desperate or wicked,
[57:27] &gt;&gt; unconverted? How can we how can we?
[57:31] That's what we want to look into this
[57:32] morning. And I mean it's it's just it's
[57:35] uh it's such a such a beautiful thought.
[57:40] You see it all over you see it all over
[57:42] the scripture. Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; You see it all over the scripture. The
[57:47] Bible says we must make our call and our
[57:50] election show. But uh uh I mean uh uh uh
[57:55] we he's the one that is calling. you
[57:57] know, God has to call
[58:00] uh we have to get hearing in our heart
[58:03] for us to be sure of who is calling us.
[58:06] So, all of these things, that's what we
[58:08] want to look at this morning. Praise the
[58:10] Lord.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to look at this
[58:13] morning. So, there are there are just
[58:15] some few things that we will play with.
[58:17] I will try to be to be a little bit fast
[58:20] this morning. So, uh just uh on the
[58:22] march, get set.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Ready?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Ready. Praise the Lord.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, let's get let's get
[58:31] running this morning. Praise the Lord.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I want I want us to keep
[58:37] keep that principle at the back of our
[58:39] mind because if you don't get that
[58:42] principle,
[58:44] you will think your love for God is your
[58:48] works.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; There's the things that you are doing.
[58:52] You are proving that you are loving God.
[58:54] No,
[58:55] &gt;&gt; you can't. Let let me read something to
[58:57] you here that will also set us in
[59:00] motion.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; From Kingsman Redeemer.
[59:07] And when a man love a woman
[59:11] and marry her because she's just pretty,
[59:15] there will be an end to that. Praise the
[59:18] Lord.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And let's turn the picture also. When a
[59:22] woman married a man because he's
[59:23] handsome, there will be an end to that.
[59:25] Amen. When teeth start falling,
[59:33] praise the Lord.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; No, we can use denture. Anyway,
[59:41] there will be an end to that. But when a
[59:44] man now grab the concept now, I'm just
[59:46] I'm just trying to make you relax a
[59:48] little bit. Amen. But when a man find a
[59:52] woman that he love,
[59:56] he don't know why.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Think about it. On Wednesday night, we
[1:00:01] sang that song, I don't know why Jesus
[1:00:04] loved me.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, you can talk about redemption.
[1:00:08] My name was on the Lamb's book of life.
[1:00:11] Those are just glad of information you
[1:00:14] have.
[1:00:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many people thought their
[1:00:21] names was on the Lamb book of life? They
[1:00:23] saw their name when the seal was open
[1:00:25] and then they no longer believe the
[1:00:26] message.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:34] So one [clears throat] of the one of the
[1:00:37] one of the the the problem one of our
[1:00:41] default is that we took lot of spiritual
[1:00:44] things that were taught to us by a
[1:00:47] prophet and we took it with counter
[1:00:51] mind.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now even this even this particular
[1:00:58] quot I'm reading when a man
[1:01:02] love when a man find a woman that he
[1:01:05] love and don't know why
[1:01:08] take this thing million times to God's
[1:01:12] love for you.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:19] You see, we we we take these things and
[1:01:21] we just attribute it to ourself, our
[1:01:24] wives, and all of that. It's just we are
[1:01:28] just a shadow
[1:01:30] of what God is expressing in his word.
[1:01:36] A man love for his wife is just a
[1:01:37] shadow. It's not even agape. It's filio.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Just filled with feelings.
[1:01:48] Are we together? So when a man love a
[1:01:52] woman and he don't know why, thinking in
[1:01:54] a in a place of Christ love his church,
[1:02:01] his love for us.
[1:02:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:12] I don't know why but he love her and she
[1:02:15] find
[1:02:16] the man that she love no matter what he
[1:02:19] looks like
[1:02:22] he love her she love him
[1:02:26] that's an internment in glory
[1:02:31] praise the lord
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; now inade glory look at the thought here
[1:02:36] in internment in glory is tying it to
[1:02:41] nothing.
[1:02:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; To be an internment to Christ is not our
[1:02:50] works. It's not our church membership.
[1:02:53] It's not our self dedication.
[1:02:57] It's just because he loved us
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and we don't know why.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's an eternal mate.
[1:03:13] If you are attributing your eternal life
[1:03:16] to when you met Christ, how long you've
[1:03:18] been serving God, praise the Lord.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you this morning.
[1:03:25] I want to encourage you. You got to
[1:03:27] think it. Think it over. Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He says that's an eternal man. If if a
[1:03:32] if if a fallen man can ever get to that
[1:03:35] place to be able to lo love love another
[1:03:37] fallen woman and can say I really don't
[1:03:40] know why I love this woman. Amen.
[1:03:43] So I mean that that is just a slogan
[1:03:47] but go I mean carry on to the book we
[1:03:49] will tell you why we love her.
[1:03:53] Are we together?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That's intent of me. He says death h
[1:04:00] nothing nothing else can separate them
[1:04:02] because they are from eternity. They
[1:04:05] step they step uh uh out into space of
[1:04:09] time and we return back to eternity.
[1:04:12] Eteranity will drop down in a body
[1:04:16] called time. Eternity has dropped down
[1:04:18] in a body called time. Then it goes
[1:04:21] right back up into eternity again.
[1:04:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:29] A whole lot we can say here. But it all
[1:04:32] backs to our question. We are trying to
[1:04:35] look ourself through the word this
[1:04:38] morning. How can we love God with all of
[1:04:40] our heart, all of our soul, all of our
[1:04:43] mind, all of our strength. Praise the
[1:04:46] Lord.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the ways I think that we
[1:04:50] can do it, that's why we want to use uh
[1:04:53] Eza and Rebecca's story as a type to be
[1:04:56] really be able to bring it out. I said a
[1:04:59] little bit about that on Wednesday night
[1:05:01] and when I went home, it kind of forgot
[1:05:03] my mind and and I just I just went in
[1:05:06] that direction and and kept thinking
[1:05:08] about it. Genesis chapter 22.
[1:05:12] Praise the Lord. So I I hope you you're
[1:05:15] on the mar ready to go now because we're
[1:05:17] going to run we're going to run in and
[1:05:20] Genesis chapter 22 is one of uh a a
[1:05:24] sublime scripture in the Bible in the
[1:05:26] Old Testament because it has a type a
[1:05:29] perfect type of God uh giving his his
[1:05:33] only son. Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Now we see Genesis 22 was where God
[1:05:37] called Abraham. Praise the Lord. The
[1:05:40] Bible says it came to pass in the Lord
[1:05:43] called Abraham. He says, "Behold, here I
[1:05:46] am." He says, "Take now thy son that thy
[1:05:49] ownest son whom thou loveth and give uh
[1:05:55] thee, and get thee into the land of
[1:05:58] Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt
[1:06:01] offering upon one of the mountain, which
[1:06:03] I will tell thee." Abraham rose up early
[1:06:06] in the morning and sed his eyes and took
[1:06:09] uh uh two of his young men and went with
[1:06:11] him. So now it was Abraham and two of
[1:06:14] his young men. Praise the Lord. Verse
[1:06:17] four. Then on the third day Abraham
[1:06:19] lifted up his eyes and saw the place far
[1:06:22] off. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[1:06:27] And Abraham said unto the young man,
[1:06:29] he's saying to the young men, the two
[1:06:31] young men, he says, Abide year abide
[1:06:36] with their eyes, and I and the lad will
[1:06:39] go yonder and worship and come again. So
[1:06:44] Abraham now, now look at verse uh four.
[1:06:48] On the third day, Abraham lifted up his
[1:06:51] eyes and saw the place a far off. Praise
[1:06:55] the Lord.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Now, now uh Abraham lifted up his eyes.
[1:07:00] Was that a vision? Was that a physical
[1:07:02] sight? Was that a vision? But look at
[1:07:04] the next thing he said after he saw the
[1:07:07] place of the Bible said he said to the
[1:07:09] two young men, "Y'all wait for us here.
[1:07:12] Uh uh uh uh the boy and my we are going
[1:07:15] up on the hill. We will we will worship
[1:07:18] and we will return."
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; God never told him that they will
[1:07:22] return. God told him, "Go and sacrifice
[1:07:24] your son to me."
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; But he's prophesied
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; that we will get up the hill and we will
[1:07:31] return.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; now? So uh uh you will see here that uh
[1:07:40] uh Abraham took the wood and and he went
[1:07:43] up the hill
[1:07:45] and he went and uh uh we know the rest
[1:07:48] of the story uh you know how how God
[1:07:51] stepped in but there is something I want
[1:07:53] us to see here.
[1:07:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Abraham called the place
[1:08:02] Jehovah Jara in the sea where I blessed
[1:08:06] thee.
[1:08:09] Now uh uh uh look at verse look at verse
[1:08:13] 19.
[1:08:14] You know everything that that that took
[1:08:16] place there. Everything that took place
[1:08:18] there we are aware of it. But look at
[1:08:20] verse 19. The Bible says, "So Abraham
[1:08:23] returned unto his young men and they
[1:08:28] arose
[1:08:30] and they rose up, sorry, and went
[1:08:32] together to Belsheba and Abraham dwela."
[1:08:37] Now you will realize in this Genesis 22,
[1:08:42] after the experience of God giving
[1:08:46] Abraham the lamb and said, "Don't kill
[1:08:48] your only son uh uh Isaac. There's
[1:08:51] Salam. He said Jehovah Garrett. And God
[1:08:53] gave him the blessing. Reading from
[1:08:55] verse 15, the angel of the Lord called
[1:08:57] unto Abraham uh out of heaven the second
[1:09:00] time. And and coming down, you will
[1:09:03] realize that for some reason the Holy
[1:09:07] Spirit took Isaac out of the text.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Isaac is never spoke about again until
[1:09:16] Genesis 24.
[1:09:20] The Bible say Abraham returned to his
[1:09:24] young men. Where was Isaac? Isaac was
[1:09:27] there. It was Abraham and Isaac that
[1:09:30] returned.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; But for some reason, the Bible never say
[1:09:34] Abraham and Isaac returned unto the
[1:09:37] young men. It just said Abraham returned
[1:09:40] to the young men.
[1:09:43] Are you seeing it?
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and then take the
[1:09:47] reading from there and go on and never
[1:09:51] speak about Isaac again.
[1:09:56] So Christ died on the cross.
[1:10:03] He died on the cross and the only time
[1:10:06] he returning to the picture is for his
[1:10:09] bride.
[1:10:15] Are we together?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; When he went on the cross, he gave up
[1:10:22] the ghost. That was the end of his
[1:10:24] earthly ministry.
[1:10:29] He resurrected, but the multitude didn't
[1:10:32] see him. The people didn't see him. It
[1:10:33] was only to the believers that he
[1:10:35] revealed himself.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; So he re he revered himself to the
[1:10:51] believer 40 days. He was here with the
[1:10:53] believers. He ascended up uh h uh there
[1:10:58] on the mountain. The the the the
[1:11:00] Pharisees couldn't see him. The
[1:11:02] unbelievers couldn't see him. That was
[1:11:04] the reason why he told them before
[1:11:06] before that happened. a little while
[1:11:08] I'll be with you and you will see me.
[1:11:10] You know, the world will not see me and
[1:11:12] all of that he said. But what I want us
[1:11:14] to be able to see in the scripture here
[1:11:16] is that God foreshadowed this in the Old
[1:11:20] Testament. He foreshadowed this right
[1:11:23] here after Abraham the lamb took the
[1:11:26] place of Isaac and Abraham sacrificed
[1:11:29] the lamb and God blessed Abraham and all
[1:11:32] of that. For some reason, Isaac vanished
[1:11:35] out of the text.
[1:11:38] And Abraham returned unto his young men,
[1:11:41] and they rose up, and they went together
[1:11:44] to Belshiva. And Abraham dura. Read the
[1:11:47] rest of uh uh chapter 22. Isaac is now
[1:11:51] mentioned. Chapter 23, Isaac is not
[1:11:54] mentioned.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Until chapter 24. And the person that
[1:12:04] will mention Isaac
[1:12:07] is not Isaac doing but it will be
[1:12:09] Abraham calling his servant
[1:12:13] Alazer.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another thing also when you look
[1:12:18] in in in chapter 24 Eliza name is not
[1:12:22] mentioned.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Eliza name is not mentioned in chapter
[1:12:31] 24. The only reason why we know that
[1:12:34] this is Eleaza because back in chapter
[1:12:37] 15 when Abraham was crying unto God, I
[1:12:40] don't have a child. I'm getting old. I'm
[1:12:43] going to take this Eleaha that is born
[1:12:46] in my house to to make him my reason why
[1:12:50] we can believe that this is Eza
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; because he was a trusted seven.
[1:12:57] But you read the whole of CHAPTER 24,
[1:12:59] YOU NEVER SEE Eliza name.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Jesus said when the
[1:13:05] comforter come, he will not speak of
[1:13:08] himself.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; So if you look through the scripture,
[1:13:14] you will see that everywhere where a
[1:13:18] person is representing the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:21] their name is never mentioned.
[1:13:28] Are we together?
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Because he will not speak of himself.
[1:13:36] So, chapter 22,
[1:13:40] right after the crucification, Isaac is
[1:13:43] vanished out of the text.
[1:13:46] Isaac do not return back into into the
[1:13:49] text. The only time that Isaac returned
[1:13:52] was on the field.
[1:13:55] when Eliza was coming back with Rebecca,
[1:13:58] that's the only time Isaac returned back
[1:14:00] in the text and that is the only time
[1:14:03] Christ will return back on the earth
[1:14:05] when we are taken off. [laughter]
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Oh man, this is not a Jewish book. This
[1:14:15] thing was written with the mind of God.
[1:14:17] Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The very mind of God is
[1:14:21] hidden right in the text.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] Amen. So we see here in chapter 24,
[1:14:27] Abraham is well stricken in age. That's
[1:14:30] what the Bible says. And the Lord have
[1:14:32] blessed Abraham in all things. And
[1:14:35] Abraham said unto his servant
[1:14:40] of his house,
[1:14:42] that rule over all that he had.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Put I pray thee thy hand on my tie. So,
[1:14:50] just like I said, you will never see
[1:14:51] Eliza name mentioned there. His name is
[1:14:54] mentioned back in chapter 15.
[1:14:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I'm loving the word this morning. Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; I'm loving the word this morning because
[1:15:07] uh uh these are the things that makes
[1:15:11] the message true to me.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Because I can see it right in the pages
[1:15:16] of the Bible.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Are we together?
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; So Abraham called his servant. Now you
[1:15:24] got to pay attention here. Now he call
[1:15:28] his servant, put his hand on me. He says
[1:15:30] verse three, "And I I make thee sword uh
[1:15:33] by my hand, the God of heaven, the God
[1:15:37] of the earth, that thou shalt not take a
[1:15:39] wife unto
[1:15:42] my son of the daughters of the
[1:15:44] Canaanites." This this actually breaks
[1:15:48] something very important. People, I've
[1:15:51] been I've been I've been I've been
[1:15:54] holding my teeth since uh since I saw
[1:15:57] this just, you know, it's one of those
[1:16:00] things where you're trying to look for
[1:16:02] the perfect time to preach it,
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; but it's just coming up and every time
[1:16:06] you're trying to preach.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; This is a this is an amazing thing. When
[1:16:10] you look in the Bible, it's an amazing
[1:16:13] thing. And I could take the the rest of
[1:16:16] the year or the rest of 2026 if if Jesus
[1:16:20] started to preach on that subject.
[1:16:25] Here Abraham is calling Eliza
[1:16:29] to go and look for bride for his son.
[1:16:34] Isaac is not in the choosing of his
[1:16:38] bride.
[1:16:42] Just like Adam was not in the choosing
[1:16:45] of his bride. It was not Adam desire. It
[1:16:50] was not Adam that was saying I'm alone
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; and I need to find a bride.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; No, it was God.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; It was not Isaac years saying, "Father,
[1:17:07] send Eliza to find me the wife or father
[1:17:09] I want." No, Isaac never knew about
[1:17:13] this,
[1:17:17] but it's Abraham.
[1:17:20] And just like I said, many times these
[1:17:23] these these scriptural things,
[1:17:27] it's so easy for us to start applying it
[1:17:29] to ourself and then we miss the
[1:17:31] principle because we are just a man
[1:17:35] shadow
[1:17:38] in the in the great mind of God.
[1:17:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; And there is a reason. There is a
[1:17:46] reason. Go go go go go in the gospels
[1:17:49] and and and and and and read all the
[1:17:52] parables where Jesus said the father
[1:17:55] sent out a seven for the wedding. Every
[1:17:59] parable about the wedding feast, it was
[1:18:01] the father making a feast for the
[1:18:05] marriage of his son. It was not the son
[1:18:09] looking for a wife.
[1:18:15] Read the entire parable. Read Matthew
[1:18:17] chapter 22.
[1:18:20] Read Matthew chapter 22. The father sent
[1:18:23] out and this one gave excuse. This one
[1:18:25] brother Ben Brandon use that to preach
[1:18:26] life water of the gospel. This one give
[1:18:29] an excuse. Oh, I get a farm. I cannot
[1:18:30] come. This other one AND HE SAYS GO INTO
[1:18:33] THE BYWAYS.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; GO INTO THE BYWAY. GRAB THE HOMELESS
[1:18:38] PEOPLE, THE DRUNKERS. BRING them
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; to the feast.
[1:18:42] And when and when I studied that when I
[1:18:45] studied that,
[1:18:48] it just blew my mind.
[1:18:52] It just blew my mind.
[1:18:56] It just blew my mind when I when I when
[1:18:58] when you really look into it.
[1:19:02] You really look into it. about reading
[1:19:04] uh gen uh Matthew 22 the auto dying I
[1:19:07] mean uh sitting on my little table in
[1:19:09] the room and and just telling man it was
[1:19:12] almost like I I almost wanted to pop out
[1:19:14] of the table and just go through the
[1:19:16] roof because I'm thinking in my mind
[1:19:18] think about this you think about this
[1:19:24] why why let's let's put it in the human
[1:19:28] sense now why were these people
[1:19:34] gave an excuse.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Why would they give an excuse
[1:19:41] to this great wedding?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And do you know also in
[1:19:46] those parable the bride is never
[1:19:49] mentioned. Who is the bride? It just the
[1:19:51] father having wedding but the bride is
[1:19:54] not mentioned.
[1:19:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:02] The bride is not mentioned. The bride,
[1:20:04] they never says that the the bride, you
[1:20:06] know, is Esther, the bride is is uh uh
[1:20:10] uh uh married or or this all these guys
[1:20:13] are haunting me. Let me get back here.
[1:20:15] [snorts]
[1:20:18] And uh uh uh and when you actually look
[1:20:23] at it, oh my god, it's so beautiful.
[1:20:25] people. Do you know that the people that
[1:20:29] accepted the invitation
[1:20:32] turned to be the bride?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Do you know that those that accepted the
[1:20:44] invitation turned to be the bride?
[1:20:50] There was not a bride at the wedding.
[1:20:54] The father was was bringing his people
[1:20:57] to the feast of his son.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; And I was and when you think about it in
[1:21:06] a natural sense, you will you would
[1:21:08] think that the in my mind I was sitting
[1:21:10] there, man, these people they miss out
[1:21:13] because in their mind
[1:21:15] he never even told where he's getting
[1:21:17] this woman from. We don't know if uh I
[1:21:19] mean he left all of our daughters and
[1:21:22] he's just then we must go to his his son
[1:21:24] wedding. We don't even know who's the
[1:21:27] bride.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Because that sometimes that's
[1:21:35] the way we behave.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; I don't even know who he getting married
[1:21:41] to. Why does that concern me?
[1:21:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; But they miss out
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; because as he was inviting them to the
[1:21:54] to the to the wedding feast of his son,
[1:21:57] he was looking for a bride.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what play out with King
[1:22:03] Hasseras?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; When Vast denied,
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; there was not a bride.
[1:22:11] They sent out to all the virgins of the
[1:22:14] land to come to the feast. And it was at
[1:22:17] the feast that the bride was choosing.
[1:22:22] [clears throat]
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I'm telling you.
[1:22:33] I'm telling you.
[1:22:36] I feel like changing my subject this
[1:22:38] morning.
[1:22:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; I'm feel like changing my subject. But
[1:22:44] let's talk on Eliza. Tell me more.
[1:22:46] [laughter]
[1:22:47] We have Eliza. That's the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:49] Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; We can say El Isa, tell me more.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:55] Amen. Amen. Amen. So it is Isaac. He is
[1:22:59] sending out Esa to go and look for the
[1:23:01] bride. I mean is Abraham sending out Eza
[1:23:05] to go and look for the bride, you know.
[1:23:08] to uh uh uh
[1:23:11] to go and find a wife for his son Isaac.
[1:23:17] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:23:20] Isaac is not in this discussion. Is the
[1:23:23] father and and the seven.
[1:23:26] Praise the Lord. And the father is
[1:23:30] giving him a a a complete directive. The
[1:23:33] father is not saying go and talk to my
[1:23:35] son Isaac and let he tell you the kind
[1:23:37] of a woman you want know.
[1:23:40] The father is saying you go
[1:23:43] promise me not from the Kenna go
[1:23:45] directly to this place and uh go to this
[1:23:48] place and Isaac is not in the
[1:23:51] conversation.
[1:23:53] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible says when God taught that it
[1:23:58] was not good for men to be alone,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; he never came down and discussed with
[1:24:03] Adam and say, "Adam, how are you
[1:24:04] feeling? Are you okay? Do you need a
[1:24:06] bride now?"
[1:24:10] And there is a reason. There is a
[1:24:13] reason. Oh man,
[1:24:18] there is a reason. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; There is a reason.
[1:24:26] Amen.
[1:24:38] There is a reason. There's a wonderful
[1:24:40] reason
[1:24:42] and we'll share we'll share that with
[1:24:43] you.
[1:24:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; My head is spinning now. Where are we
[1:24:54] this morning? Let's take let's take
[1:24:57] something here from from God's prophet
[1:25:00] and uh and go in just to be able to warm
[1:25:03] up here.
[1:25:05] Amen.
[1:25:07] Amen.
[1:25:12] And contending for the faith. Let's just
[1:25:15] read this and see what he says here.
[1:25:16] [clears throat] He says
[1:25:19] when the father when the father that
[1:25:22] caught my mind when the father Abraham
[1:25:25] sent the servant out a very beautiful
[1:25:29] type of god the father sent it out for
[1:25:32] his bride. Amen. Send it out for his
[1:25:36] bride to get his bride
[1:25:40] his servant the Holy Spirit Eliza. Amen.
[1:25:45] So he bring Elea in type of the Holy
[1:25:48] Ghost and that's that's where Eliza is
[1:25:50] playing here in Genesis 24. And it was
[1:25:55] it was in the cool of the evening uh
[1:25:57] when the beautiful Rebecca come out to
[1:26:00] the water.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come out to water the camel.
[1:26:05] Praise the Lord. It was in the evening
[1:26:08] time.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Let's let's read another one here from
[1:26:11] uh the message while we are
[1:26:13] denomination. When Eleazar found her, it
[1:26:16] was in the evening time and she watered
[1:26:19] the candle. Cuz Eliza said, "If if if
[1:26:23] the dam say that comes and water this
[1:26:26] candle, that will be and give me the
[1:26:30] drink that will be the one that you have
[1:26:35] chosen, Lord, to be the bride of your
[1:26:39] servant Isaac." And I love this. He said
[1:26:42] this. Listen to this now. And while he
[1:26:44] was here, pray.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Rebecca comes out and draw water and
[1:26:52] give him a drink and water the candle.
[1:26:56] Now when when I when I read this, you
[1:26:59] know what came to my mind? Brother
[1:27:01] Brandham says why he was praying. Now it
[1:27:04] would look like uh uh uh uh Elaf said
[1:27:09] his prayer
[1:27:12] in secret.
[1:27:14] But brother Brandham is saying why he
[1:27:16] was praying. And that's the thing we do
[1:27:18] all the time. We do it all the time. We
[1:27:20] commit things to God and we also keep it
[1:27:23] in our heart.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; So he was praying in his heart. He kept
[1:27:31] remembering what he said to God.
[1:27:34] I mean it was just it was just beautiful
[1:27:36] why he was praying because every woman
[1:27:38] he saw he he kept praying and says well
[1:27:41] okay Lord Jesus the one that the woman
[1:27:44] that that we gave me the drink
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; he's now altering it he's saying it in
[1:27:49] his heart he keeps praying
[1:27:53] I just love that. Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:57] While he was praying,
[1:28:01] Rebecca come out and and and and draw
[1:28:04] water and give him to drink and uh and
[1:28:08] they came to drink.
[1:28:11] Praise the Lord. Now the camel was a
[1:28:15] beast and that same camel that she was
[1:28:19] watering was uh the one who pack her to
[1:28:23] be to be his bride to be a
[1:28:26] [clears throat] bride Isaac.
[1:28:28] And today the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:31] that the church is watering and
[1:28:33] worshiping is the same thing that we're
[1:28:36] packing from this earth to meet
[1:28:40] the bride or the bridegroom.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he also said this too. Let's
[1:28:47] let let's just take few of our notes
[1:28:49] here then we go into what we want to
[1:28:51] say. Time time of uh of decision. in the
[1:28:54] time of decision. He says, "And it was
[1:28:56] in the evening time when he come when he
[1:28:58] come to the well near the city and it
[1:29:02] was about the time that Rebecca had had
[1:29:05] to make a decision.
[1:29:08] I believe the angel of the Lord beat him
[1:29:11] there about
[1:29:14] a half hour.
[1:29:16] Praise the Lord. For he said, "For he,
[1:29:21] for he will send his angels before you
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; to make the way clear."
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And it must have been the angel of God
[1:29:31] spoke to Rebecca Hart and said, "Go get
[1:29:34] water."
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Now, the less are praying here, God
[1:29:38] working on both ends.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; He's scared to death. I mean he's uh he
[1:29:46] he he he he don't want to he don't want
[1:29:48] to make mistake on this thing and he's
[1:29:50] trusting God. He's trusting that the
[1:29:52] angel of the Lord that Abraham have
[1:29:54] talked about all of this time will help
[1:29:56] him
[1:29:58] and he's making this request to let it
[1:30:00] be. And brother Abraham is saying the
[1:30:02] angel beat him 30 minutes. The angel
[1:30:06] went ahead and prepare Rebecca heart.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; The very thing he was thinking in his
[1:30:11] mind the angel dropped it in her heart.
[1:30:16] Are we together?
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon will will tell us
[1:30:23] uh a similar experience in the message
[1:30:26] the power of God uh uh when when brother
[1:30:29] E Fosa was down in in uh in South Africa
[1:30:33] on on on the missionary trip and he got
[1:30:35] sick. Brother Brand was haunting and he
[1:30:38] says he just the Lord told him to stop
[1:30:41] and say pray for FF bus at once.
[1:30:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; And then he prayed for B. He says,
[1:30:48] "Lord, your servant is aware. Whatever
[1:30:50] is wrong, you know, I just committing in
[1:30:52] your hands." And and as soon as Brother
[1:30:54] Brandham came from from from hunting, he
[1:30:57] got out, there was a telegram wanting
[1:30:59] him to pray for FBo. He said, "The angel
[1:31:03] of the Lord beat the telegram."
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Before the telegram could get to me, the
[1:31:08] angel has already told me that brother
[1:31:11] was not well. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh uh
[1:31:22] so in in in in just kind of a setting in
[1:31:25] motion here, we see here that uh the
[1:31:28] father is giving uh instruction to his
[1:31:31] servant to go out and and uh uh uh find
[1:31:35] the bride for Isaac.
[1:31:38] And we know that it's it's in a kind of
[1:31:41] fall. It's in it's it's in a divine
[1:31:44] type. We'll look at some of the types as
[1:31:46] we go along. But when when you look at
[1:31:48] what is happening here is that Eliza
[1:31:52] goes out
[1:31:54] and he meets this woman, everything
[1:31:57] plays out just like he prayed and he's
[1:32:00] anxious. Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; He's anxious. The Bible says when you
[1:32:05] read Genesis chapter 24, uh uh uh uh
[1:32:08] Rebecca, people tells us say, "Well, you
[1:32:11] stay here with us one week. Let's let's
[1:32:13] just let's just have a feast. Let's
[1:32:15] rejoice." He said, "No, no, I need to
[1:32:17] go. I I I need to go. Please, if you
[1:32:20] allow me to go, let me go now." Because
[1:32:23] he felt so much in his heart that God
[1:32:25] has answered his prayer. Everything has
[1:32:27] worked out. He want to make sure he get
[1:32:30] over to Abraham.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:33] Hallelujah.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; But here is Rebecca here now. She's
[1:32:37] going to be asked and they ask her. She
[1:32:40] says, "How we go?" And uh uh uh and and
[1:32:44] she and she gets on the camel with this
[1:32:48] man.
[1:32:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:52] She gets on a journey with this man. I
[1:32:56] want you to pay attention here also.
[1:32:57] Time of decision. Let's let's read this
[1:33:00] other quote right here. Now look, the
[1:33:04] only thing that she had was the story of
[1:33:09] Abraham 7.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Now that's where my inspiration comes.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Eliza, tell me more.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Because the only thing that Rebecca
[1:33:21] knows about Isaac
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; is what the seven tells her.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; How tall is he? He's just about your
[1:33:32] height. Praise the Lord. Was his eyes
[1:33:36] color? Because this servant was in the
[1:33:39] house when Isaac was born.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; This is a man. This is the chief servant
[1:33:44] of Abraham house. He knows everything.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; He knows everything that concerning the
[1:33:50] father. He knows how much how much cate.
[1:33:54] He knows the wealth that Isaac is going
[1:33:57] to IN INHERIT. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING about
[1:34:00] Isaac. everything about Abraham.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the only thing that
[1:34:06] Rebecca have
[1:34:08] is Eliza's story.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; How can we love the Lord with all of our
[1:34:16] heart?
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. HOW IS SHE FALLING IN
[1:34:23] LOVE WITH THIS MAN THAT SHE HAVE not
[1:34:26] seen?
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:32] Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; She's going to love a man
[1:34:38] that she have not seen and and and and I
[1:34:41] mean she don't know nothing about only
[1:34:44] from the constant story that Eliza would
[1:34:47] tell her.
[1:34:49] The word OF GOD IS SHARPER than the
[1:34:51] two-edged sword, says Paul into the
[1:34:55] divide in the sun. And that's that's
[1:34:57] what happened to the believer when we
[1:34:59] receive the word. When we receive the
[1:35:02] word, the word gets in our heart. It it
[1:35:05] it pulls our soul aside from our spirit.
[1:35:09] It goes down and start dealing with some
[1:35:11] generation things in our spirit. It gets
[1:35:14] to the marrows of our bone and start
[1:35:16] healing sicknesses in our bone. IT GETS
[1:35:19] TO OUR SOUL AND IT START identifying h
[1:35:23] attributes of God in our soul. Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; WE NOT JUST COMING TO CHURCH. UH IT'S
[1:35:31] JUST LIKE WHEN YOU EAT A FOOD, you you
[1:35:33] take the food, you you PUT IN YOUR
[1:35:35] MOUTH, YOU CHEW IT WHEN IT GETS DOWN.
[1:35:37] GOD DESIGNED your system to break that
[1:35:40] food down. Take the nutrient that must
[1:35:42] go TO YOUR BLOOD. THE ONE THAT IS GOOD
[1:35:44] FOR YOUR HEART GOES TO YOUR HEART. THE
[1:35:46] ONE THAT SHOULD PUSH YOUR LIVER FROM IT
[1:35:49] GOES TO YOUR LABOR. GOD DESIGNED YOUR
[1:35:51] BODY TO DO THAT. THAT IS THE SAME WAY HE
[1:35:54] DESIGNED THE HOLY GHOST IN THE CHURCH TO
[1:35:57] BREAK THE WORD DOWN AND DISTRIBUTE IT TO
[1:36:00] your body.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; AND THE MORE SHE HEARD ABOUT ISAAC, THE
[1:36:07] MORE SHE FALL in love WITH HIM. THE MORE
[1:36:09] YOU RECEIVE THE WORD, THE MORE YOU ARE
[1:36:11] LOVING GOD.
[1:36:19] Faith comes by hearing AND HEARING THE
[1:36:21] WORD OF GOD.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOME FAIRY TALES.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOING AWAY FROM HOME.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; SHE HAS TO BELIEVE THIS MAN.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; SHE HAS TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING HE SAYS.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; She's going away from home.
[1:36:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] And when you receive the Lord, when you
[1:36:47] hear this message,
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; you are going away from home.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Your life will never be
[1:36:54] the same depending on what you do with
[1:36:55] this message.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It can change YOUR LIFE
[1:37:00] FOR THE BETTER FOREVER.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; OR it will create something in you. You
[1:37:05] will never believe God
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; because you will not have no standard
[1:37:09] higher than the standard.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You will not have the standard.
[1:37:18] You cannot go to any denomination church
[1:37:20] and be happy because you know everything
[1:37:22] about denomination.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; You know everything about denomination.
[1:37:26] YOU YOU CANNOT GO THERE and sit down and
[1:37:29] be happy. Mhm.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; While the preacher is preaching,
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; you'll be correcting him.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; YEAH. BECAUSE YOU ARE COMING FROM SATAN
[1:37:40] FROM HONOR MAY FALL FOR YOU CANNOT go to
[1:37:43] a denomination church
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; and be happy.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THIS MAN.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ELIZA THAT
[1:37:55] EVERYTHING HE'S SAYING TO YOU IS THE
[1:37:57] TRUTH. NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; She's going away from home.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Eliza, tell me more.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Tell me MORE HOW MY ISAAC LOOKS LIKE.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE LIKES?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE LIKES?
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; You say you were there when he was born.
[1:38:21] What he likes.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. [laughter]
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing she has
[1:38:31] was
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; the message of the seven. Oh man, I love
[1:38:37] that.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says here now look the the
[1:38:45] only thing that she had was the story of
[1:38:48] Abraham's seven.
[1:38:50] So just faith comes by hearing. She
[1:38:53] heard that Abraham had a son. Remember
[1:38:57] now, Eliza is now talking about Ishmael.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; What whether uh uh uh uh uh uh Abraham
[1:39:07] make mistake and slept with Hega, that's
[1:39:09] not Elsa message.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; That's not Elsa message.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Whether Ishmael was born before Isaac,
[1:39:20] that was not Elsa MESSAGE. WHEN ELIZA
[1:39:23] TALKS ABOUT ISAAC, IT'S ONLY ISAAC.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; SHE ONLY KNOWS ABOUT ISAAC.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; ALSA WAS NOT SENT TO TELL UH REBECCA
[1:39:42] about Abraham mistakes
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; OR DOES SARAH LAUGH?
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:50] How is that going to help her?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; She's not going to live with Sarah.
[1:39:54] Sarah is already dead.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Alisa, tell me more.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] The only thing that she had was the
[1:40:13] story of Abraham. Seven faith cometh BY
[1:40:16] HEARING. HE HEARD that Abraham had a son
[1:40:20] that was
[1:40:22] here of all things that Abraham had.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Man, he's talking about Abraham 10 kos.
[1:40:29] You're not even talking about Lord.
[1:40:31] There was a separation. You know,
[1:40:32] Abraham brought his cursing Lord and
[1:40:34] Lord says he want to. That's not Eisa
[1:40:37] message.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; That is not Elsa message. Go and find it
[1:40:42] on YouTube. Whatever you want to find.
[1:40:44] That's not Elisa message.
[1:40:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Ela message. There's a land beyond the
[1:40:56] river
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; that we call the sweet forever.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; That was Eliza message.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Elisa message was rapturing faith on the
[1:41:07] stage.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; All the other ones were just cheap
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; gossiping.
[1:41:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Or let me read this thing. I say I'm not
[1:41:24] going to get through now.
[1:41:27] And she heard that Abraham had a son and
[1:41:30] and and and he was hers to all things
[1:41:32] that Abraham had. And this little
[1:41:35] talking
[1:41:36] WAS JUST A LITTLE BITTY THINGS, just a
[1:41:41] little symbol of great wealth. telling
[1:41:44] her, "You see all the bracelets that I
[1:41:46] gave you? I didn't buy them.
[1:41:50] I took them from Abraham's house."
[1:41:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; All of these little gifts you are seeing
[1:41:57] discerning and all of the things you saw
[1:41:59] in Brother Brandon ministry.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; They came from Abraham's house.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on. AND ALL THESE
[1:42:08] LITTLE TOKENS AND AND JUST THESE LITTLE
[1:42:11] BIT of things just uh just a symbol of
[1:42:13] the great wealth that Abraham had
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; that his son was going to fall here to
[1:42:19] all of faith and she believed
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; the story
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; and she believed
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; the story.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. SHE BELIEVED ELEA SO
[1:42:34] MUCH THAT WHEN SHE GOT TO THE LAND and
[1:42:37] was talking to Elea have another brother
[1:42:39] called Isaac, she said, "Esa never told
[1:42:42] me."
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] Elisa never told me. AND BECAUSE HE
[1:42:50] NEVER TOLD ME, IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; How can we love the Lord with all of our
[1:43:01] heart
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; and all of our soul? It's not it's not
[1:43:05] our making. It's not dos and don't.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Is because when we read his word,
[1:43:13] the problem is that we've been reading
[1:43:15] the word for knowledge.
[1:43:17] We want to know where the prophet said
[1:43:19] this. We want to know where the prophet
[1:43:20] said this and where the prophet said. We
[1:43:22] are not reading the word to fall in love
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; with the one that has redeemed us.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; We are not reading the word to be
[1:43:32] grateful
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; that God HAS OPENED OUR EYES AND our
[1:43:36] understanding to these things. We're
[1:43:38] just reading it for information
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; to be able to bless one another.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ELIZA WAS TELLING HER, she was
[1:43:49] falling in love.
[1:43:52] It was not just information to her, BUT
[1:43:54] SHE WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN
[1:43:59] THAT WOULD COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN, LEAVE
[1:44:01] HIS GLORY IN HEAVEN.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; And give himself a ransom for us.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Have you really spent time telling God,
[1:44:16] "I love you."
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Just spending time
[1:44:21] and making love with God.
[1:44:28] That is one of the difficult things. We
[1:44:30] spend all the time on on the seven
[1:44:32] redemptive name of God. You are Jehovah
[1:44:34] Jar. You are Jehovah Rafa. You are you
[1:44:36] are the lady of the valley. You are the
[1:44:38] bride in the morning star. We we gave
[1:44:40] you all of these praise and never tell
[1:44:42] him we love you.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we think that he
[1:44:50] should know.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; But you know what the prophet said?
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; You must say
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; that's what he said.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; That you must say it.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; We think that our children must know
[1:45:10] that we love them. It's because of them
[1:45:12] we are working.
[1:45:15] I I'm buying this for them and giving
[1:45:17] this to them. They should know that I
[1:45:19] love them.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; But Brandham says they would never know.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the the way they
[1:45:27] understanding love is this one and that
[1:45:29] one and shoes and shirt.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; LOVE IS NOT UH IT'S IT'S NOT A
[1:45:37] RELATIONSHIP to them
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; until you say it.
[1:45:48] You said the same thing with to your
[1:45:50] wife.
[1:45:52] Say, "Well, IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR I'M
[1:45:54] DOING ALL OF THIS." This said, "She
[1:45:56] would not know until you see it."
[1:46:03] And because iniquity has abound,
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; love has once cold from our heart that
[1:46:12] our mouth cannot even say I love you.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; We can't even say it I love you. It's
[1:46:22] it's it's a word that is growing out of
[1:46:24] our culture that even when you tell
[1:46:26] someone that you love them really
[1:46:31] they got to first understand WHAT YOU
[1:46:33] MEAN.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE LOVE HAS BEEN SO DEGRADED
[1:46:38] to filth
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; that is only is only associated to sex.
[1:46:44] Yeah.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; When you tell somebody I love you, that
[1:46:47] that's the only thing that comes to
[1:46:48] their mind
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; that you should not say it today.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WAS THAT'S THE FIRST EXPRESSION
[1:47:01] OF GOD. FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORD.
[1:47:07] RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN A GREAT
[1:47:09] ETERNAL SPIRIT WAS ABOUT TO EXPRESS
[1:47:12] HIMSELF, HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF. HIS LOVE
[1:47:15] FOR THE WORD, HIS FIRST expression was
[1:47:18] the word which is called the logos. HE
[1:47:21] TOOK THE FORM OF THE WORD TO EXPRESS
[1:47:23] HIMSELF.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD FIRST EXPRESS HIMSELF TO
[1:47:28] YOU, it's not don't do this, don't do
[1:47:30] that, don't do this. No. When he express
[1:47:32] himself IS I LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHO YOU
[1:47:35] ARE.
[1:47:37] He want you to see it.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Then what what what you have to do to
[1:47:42] CHANGE YOUR LIFE. THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT
[1:47:43] MATTER TO GOD.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; HE WANT YOU TO SEE THAT HE LOVE YOU.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; I wanted to see it for you to feel it.
[1:47:54] Have you fed the love of God?
[1:47:57] Have you really fed the love of God?
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it will break you down.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. If you feel God's love, it will
[1:48:05] break you down.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; It will break every bone, every
[1:48:09] stubbornness, every strongness you think
[1:48:11] you strong.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; It will break you down. YOU FEEL SORRY
[1:48:14] FOR YOURSELF.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; God of heaven will express his love to
[1:48:19] me.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, Ellie Isa, tell me more.
[1:48:34] Tell me more
[1:48:36] how my Isaiah looks like.
[1:48:41] Praise the Lord. IT'S GONE. GONE AWAY
[1:48:44] FROM OUR CULTURE. GONE AWAY.
[1:48:48] gone away from our culture
[1:48:58] with all the fil that that that the
[1:49:00] society is swelling in their brains.
[1:49:06] I told you the story of that u that
[1:49:08] Japanese girl just listening to her
[1:49:11] testimony.
[1:49:13] we know says she felt very awkward when
[1:49:17] she she would see uh you know ch
[1:49:19] children telling you dad I love you dad
[1:49:21] I love you
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; no in in the Japanese culture it was
[1:49:25] respect you come you just
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; how much feeling in that
[1:49:41] how much feeling in
[1:49:46] that the first TIME SHE TOLD HER father
[1:49:49] I love you on the phone they went there
[1:49:51] silence
[1:49:54] it was half hour of silence
[1:50:01] THEY WENT DEAD silence on the
[1:50:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:15] She said, "Dad, are you there?"
[1:50:19] She thought she got in trouble.
[1:50:23] The conversation couldn't go any
[1:50:25] further. It was a shock to the father as
[1:50:28] much as it was a shock of it coming out
[1:50:30] of her mouth.
[1:50:39] But now she testify they have the more
[1:50:43] amazing
[1:50:46] experience
[1:50:49] because she don't have to be there with
[1:50:52] her father but when he says I love you
[1:50:54] honey she feels it she feels his
[1:50:57] presence
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; she feels his presence.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; As his fathers telling their children, I
[1:51:22] love you. I love you with the love of
[1:51:24] God.
[1:51:26] That just how hypocritical it can be.
[1:51:30] That's how hypocritical. If you tell
[1:51:32] your own daughter you love her, you got
[1:51:34] to say, "I love you with the love of
[1:51:35] God."
[1:51:39] No touch.
[1:51:42] No touch. The love of God is just
[1:51:44] reduced. And that is the thing that have
[1:51:46] that is enslaving us
[1:51:50] because we understand the love of God
[1:51:53] when we get jacket when we get phone
[1:51:56] when we get car
[1:51:58] that those are the things that we
[1:51:59] attribute God's love to.
[1:52:03] SO WHEN EVEN GOD IS EXPRESSING HIS LOVE
[1:52:05] IN silence we we don't we don't we can't
[1:52:09] connect with it.
[1:52:12] WHEN HE EXPRESSING HIS LOVE TO DRAW US
[1:52:15] CLOSER TO him and say I don't want I
[1:52:17] don't want I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY I
[1:52:19] DON'T WANT ANY I WANT YOU YOURSELF
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN GENESIS 22
[1:52:30] GOD NEVER WANTED ABRAHAM HE NEVER wanted
[1:52:33] Isaac
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; he wanted Abraham
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; WHY BECAUSE AN IDOL HAS COME IN
[1:52:40] ABRAHAM'S THAT ISAAC HAS BECOME AN IDOL
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS TAKING THAT PLACE OF GOD'S LOVE
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAYS I HAVE TO I HAVE TO
[1:52:50] CIRCUMCISE that idol give this this to
[1:52:53] ME
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; GIVE YOUR OWN SON TO me
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; he wanted to take that thing from from
[1:53:00] Abraham's heart
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; we think we understand the love of Lord,
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; we think we understand the love of God.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; We think we understand the love of God.
[1:53:33] Oh my goodness.
[1:53:36] We can go into thousand different ways
[1:53:39] this morning,
[1:53:40] but I'm I just I'm just feeling to just
[1:53:43] hold you in this place.
[1:53:50] The children who learn to tell their
[1:53:52] parents, I love you, it will be
[1:53:56] difficult for you to cheat your parents.
[1:53:59] It becomes so easy
[1:54:02] for us to fuss back, for us to talk back
[1:54:07] because our love is not failed.
[1:54:11] It's not failed.
[1:54:15] We are dead, but it's not there.
[1:54:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:37] We are there, but it's not there.
[1:54:53] quick to George and quick to to
[1:54:58] let's let's look at something here. Let
[1:55:00] me let's let's study something together
[1:55:02] here. Numbers chapter 13.

[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe not now. you appreciate it
[1:55:44] later.
[1:55:47] Numbers chapter 13. When you look at
[1:55:49] Numbers chapter 13,
[1:55:52] Numbers chapter 13, we brings us to this
[1:55:55] place where
[1:56:00] the conquering of the land, the the the
[1:56:02] the spies were sent out. The spies were
[1:56:05] sent out. Let's take one verse here,
[1:56:07] verse 30. Numbers chapter 13:30.
[1:56:11] The the Bible says and uh uh while the
[1:56:13] other people were testifying that the
[1:56:15] Amalachites dwell in the land, the
[1:56:17] Jebusites are dead and all of that.
[1:56:19] Verse 30, the Bible says, "And Caleb
[1:56:22] still the people."
[1:56:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; He took the courage to TELL THE PEOPLE,
[1:56:28] "SHUT UP."
[1:56:34] when complaining and saying there the
[1:56:36] Bible says and he steal the people
[1:56:39] before Moses
[1:56:41] and said
[1:56:43] let us go up at once and possess
[1:56:45] [snorts] it
[1:56:47] for we are well able
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; to overcome it
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; you know what that did for Caleb
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; just that one expression
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; let let's read somewhere. Genesis, I
[1:57:04] mean, uh, Numbers 32. Numbers 32, verse
[1:57:08] 12.
[1:57:10] Oh, I I I just love that when the Bible
[1:57:13] when the Bible
[1:57:17] brings us these things,
[1:57:20] you love the Lord.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and uh and and and Moses
[1:57:26] here is testifying.
[1:57:30] Moses here is testifying
[1:57:33] and he says here verse 10. Let's read
[1:57:36] from verse 10. And the Lord anger was
[1:57:38] candled at the same time. And he swore
[1:57:42] saying surely once, showing none of the
[1:57:45] men that came up out of Egypt from uh
[1:57:49] from from from 20 years old and upward
[1:57:53] shall see the land where I swore unto
[1:57:57] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, because
[1:58:00] they have not follow me. save Kaleb
[1:58:07] the son of Jofonimin the the Kennesites
[1:58:11] and Joshua the son of Nun for they have
[1:58:15] wholly followed the Lord. Now take it in
[1:58:18] a sense of loving the Lord with your
[1:58:20] whole heart.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:58:24] IT WAS NOT IN EVERYTHING THAT THEY DID.
[1:58:27] But when IT CAME TO A PROMISE OF GOD,
[1:58:32] they stood for the word.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; When it came TO A PROMISE OF GOD, GOD
[1:58:39] PROMISED THEM. IT'S NOT IN ALL THEIR DOS
[1:58:42] and don't. And that's ALL THE THING THAT
[1:58:44] all all of the little things we pick up
[1:58:46] here and there.
[1:58:48] That's the thing that messed our mind up
[1:58:50] because we want to be we want to be God
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; and God should be our creation.
[1:59:01] LET ALMIGHTY GOD WITH HIS GREAT mind
[1:59:05] that one action
[1:59:07] of CALEB AND JOSHUA GOD CONSIDER IT AS
[1:59:12] they following him with all of their
[1:59:14] heart.
[1:59:20] IT'S IT BASED ON THE PROMISE PEOPLE. It
[1:59:23] is WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:59:27] It's not come to oh yeah you know I want
[1:59:29] I want green I want green and no I want
[1:59:31] blue and and then then we start fussing
[1:59:33] and then then we don't like one another
[1:59:35] again and this no I want to move here.
[1:59:37] No I want to come down here. It's it's
[1:59:39] the word of God that matters.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:59:44] GOD LOVE IS EXPRESSED ON HIS WORD.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he follow him with all of
[1:59:57] his heart. Let's look at another one
[1:59:59] also again here. The Bible who talks
[2:00:01] about uh uh uh uh 2 Chronicles chapter
[2:00:06] 31.
[2:00:08] 2 Chronicles chapter 31. You know
[2:00:10] there's no service Wednesday night. Uh
[2:00:12] uh. So, uh [laughter]
[2:00:20] [cough]
[2:00:21] [clears throat]
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; what's funny? [laughter]
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.
[2:00:32] Okay.
[2:00:35] I'm I'm trying to connect myself with uh
[2:00:37] what's going on. Did I say something
[2:00:39] wrong?
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Is it next week?
[2:00:44] Did I miss the date? Because I know last
[2:00:46] week I missed the date. I thought I
[2:00:48] missed the date again.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Am I right? I'm right. Okay. Okay. If
[2:00:52] I'm right, that's okay.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; But you know when you when you laugh
[2:01:02] like that, I'm not offended
[2:01:04] because it just show that you praying
[2:01:06] for me. You know that I need prayers.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:10] Amen.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; It just made me to know that. Yeah.
[2:01:15] People know that I really need prayer.
[2:01:16] Amen. Got to pray for this guy.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; I know that when he get up there, his
[2:01:23] head can be twisted.
[2:01:30] Okay. 2 Chronicles chapter 31.
[2:01:38] 2 Chronicles chapter 101.
[2:01:41] Are we together?
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Verse 20. 2 Chronicles 31 31 20.
[2:01:58] You see, it's just like
[2:02:01] when Moses was taking the people. You
[2:02:04] remember when Fine
[2:02:08] took the javelin?
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; When the people were were were just uh
[2:02:13] uh rising up to eat and playing and and
[2:02:16] a young uh uh uh Hebrew boy to h a girl,
[2:02:21] a mobileite girl down in the tent and
[2:02:23] Fineas took the javelin and and and he
[2:02:26] pierced him to the bed. The Bible says
[2:02:29] it's still the wrath of God. And God
[2:02:32] said, "Because Fineas has done this,
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; I give him an everlasting covenant."
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; It does not means that he will not do
[2:02:43] wrong.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; It does not means that he will not fail
[2:02:47] as a human being. But you see, when it
[2:02:49] comes to the word of God,
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; when it comes to the word of God, if
[2:02:54] there is one thing that we must stand up
[2:02:56] for, that we must fight for, it's the
[2:02:58] word.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; It's not a a blue toothbrush and white
[2:03:04] toothbrush and and and uh uh uh you know
[2:03:07] I like spas, I don't like spas.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's look at this
[2:03:14] chapter
[2:03:16] 31 2 Chronicle 31:20.
[2:03:28] The Bible says, "And thus did Ezekiah
[2:03:33] throughout all Judah,
[2:03:39] and wrote that which was good in good
[2:03:43] and right and truth
[2:03:46] before
[2:03:47] the Lord his God, and in every works
[2:03:52] that he began in the service of the
[2:03:54] house of the Lord, and in the Lord, and
[2:03:56] in the commandments, is to keep to seek
[2:04:01] his God. He did it with
[2:04:05] all his heart and prosper.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Because that's that's where our thought
[2:04:16] is.
[2:04:19] Jesus says this is the great
[2:04:22] commandment, the first and the great
[2:04:24] commandment.
[2:04:26] Love the Lord with all of your heart,
[2:04:30] ALL OF YOUR SOUL, ALL OF YOUR MIND, all
[2:04:33] of your strength.
[2:04:35] How do we do it?
[2:04:38] What do we practice to get to that
[2:04:41] place? Is fall in love with the word
[2:04:45] is loving the word.
[2:04:47] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; It's loving the word. When something
[2:04:53] comes out of the word, even if it's
[2:04:55] against our best judgment,
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; we say, "Lord, I love you anyhow."
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD FOR MY MIND. It's hard for my
[2:05:10] my my my flesh, but I love you anyhow.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; And it's that LOVE OF GOD THAT produce
[2:05:18] strength for us to stand for
[2:05:20] righteousness. It's that LOVE OF GOD
[2:05:23] THAT produce strength to cleanse our
[2:05:25] mind. That's how we love the Lord with
[2:05:27] all of our mind because it's his word
[2:05:30] that is being generated to us and we are
[2:05:32] embracing we are loving that word.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; It is not you exercising your brain to
[2:05:40] to learn 10 Bible verse or learn h
[2:05:46] two quote a day.
[2:05:50] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Well, learning Bible verse that it helps
[2:05:53] with memory loss.
[2:05:56] That's a good thing it might do for you.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; But it's not loving God with your mind.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; It has to be the love of God's word that
[2:06:08] you receive. You receive it so much that
[2:06:11] you keep it on your mind.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; I will tell you something. Yesterday we
[2:06:17] went out uh uh uh there to support u uh
[2:06:21] uh Abby uh uh Sam and uh uh and Abby.
[2:06:27] They were they were laying their remains
[2:06:29] of uh brother brother Ben and his wife
[2:06:31] was dead and and we were out there. So
[2:06:34] [clears throat] I mean unfortunately
[2:06:35] there was there was not actually no
[2:06:37] right playing program but I'm standing
[2:06:40] there and I was I was thinking about
[2:06:43] something. I was meditating on
[2:06:44] something. uh uh from my from my
[2:06:47] devotion and the brother came to me and
[2:06:49] he said to me he said
[2:06:52] while I'm talking to him said well uh uh
[2:06:56] the Bible say you should be ready in
[2:06:58] season and out of season and I'm
[2:07:00] thinking what I mean what he does he
[2:07:02] mean by be ready in season and out of
[2:07:04] season I knew where he was going but I I
[2:07:06] felt that it was not appropriate you
[2:07:08] don't use the word of God like that you
[2:07:11] know you need a man to speak say brother
[2:07:13] can you say something
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; don't come and take me by by it was kind
[2:07:16] of a funny slogan,
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; you know. So, I'm thinking in my mind, I
[2:07:20] said, "Well, okay, this this man is is
[2:07:23] uh I mean, he's uh about to bury his
[2:07:26] baby and maybe I think I don't know what
[2:07:29] is going on here, but I said, well,
[2:07:31] okay, if the occasion is given to me, I
[2:07:34] will I will speak on it." So, I stepped
[2:07:36] away a little bit and because I had this
[2:07:39] thing on my mind, I was I was just
[2:07:40] looking at it. There was something that
[2:07:42] came out of the word. Uh uh you know
[2:07:44] when when David
[2:07:46] when David son his first son with
[2:07:49] Basheba
[2:07:51] when the baby was born the baby was sick
[2:07:54] and David cried and and he fasted and he
[2:07:57] would not eat and he would not do
[2:07:59] anything
[2:08:01] and uh uh
[2:08:04] and the Bible says and then after the
[2:08:07] tall baby the child was dead he he woke
[2:08:09] up and he's you know he's he started
[2:08:12] being life that and people were
[2:08:14] wondering his seven what's wrong with
[2:08:16] this man
[2:08:18] what's wrong and then when they asked
[2:08:21] David said this he said this he says he
[2:08:25] will not come to me
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; but I will go to him
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; do you know that
[2:08:33] that is an old testament proof that
[2:08:36] every infant die goes to heaven
[2:08:43] Because David was not only talking in
[2:08:45] the fact that I would die and go to him,
[2:08:48] but you have to know that David was an
[2:08:51] elect.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; David was a man that was anointed by
[2:08:55] Saul.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; It is almost like when when when when
[2:09:02] Samuel h Saul that tomorrow you will be
[2:09:06] with me.
[2:09:08] Samuel was not only talking about Saul
[2:09:11] uh uh will die tomorrow in battle, but
[2:09:14] Samuel was saying that Saul will be
[2:09:16] saved because wherever Samuel is is the
[2:09:19] place where those that are saved will
[2:09:21] be. Yeah.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; So what I was thinking about AS I WAS
[2:09:27] DRIVING, I was just thinking about how
[2:09:30] how the whole the Old Testament IT HOLDS
[2:09:33] VERY RICH principle very rich because
[2:09:37] David is saying he he can't come to me
[2:09:40] but I will go to him.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if if David will go to him,
[2:09:48] then wherever he is, it's a better
[2:09:51] place.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; WHEREVER HE IS, IT has to be the place
[2:09:56] of the redeemed.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; So that's what I was thinking in my
[2:10:00] mind. So I I look at the scripture then
[2:10:02] I say, "Well, okay, maybe I would just
[2:10:03] speak. This is a little baby that just
[2:10:05] passed. I will speak about if you know
[2:10:07] if I give it an opportunity." So what we
[2:10:09] did and we trying to uh you know find
[2:10:11] out what is going on and all of that and
[2:10:13] and we get down in the chapel. I started
[2:10:15] singing. We sang two songs and then
[2:10:17] brother Greg came out and and then he
[2:10:19] started
[2:10:21] when David's son passed away.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; I'm sitting right there. I said, "Oh
[2:10:26] God,
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; I said, oh God, you beat me to it."
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The very thing I'm
[2:10:33] having on my mind
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; and he's saying it out there, I'm just
[2:10:36] saying how beautiful.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; I'm saying how beautiful. There's no
[2:10:41] competition in this thing.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no competition. There is
[2:10:46] no self, you know, self labor. It is God
[2:10:49] that giving is freely giving.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; I I pray that I don't die with any
[2:10:58] secret in my heart. If the Lord reveal
[2:11:00] anything to me, praise the Lord.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; I preach it to you.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; I tell sometime before even Wednesday, I
[2:11:08] finish preaching.
[2:11:09] I've I've sent some of my notes out uh
[2:11:12] to some of my good friends and we we
[2:11:13] just we just fellowship on it a little
[2:11:15] bit
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; because that's the word. That's that's
[2:11:18] that's what the word is for.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; That's our breath. That that's that
[2:11:24] that's that's the very air that we
[2:11:26] breathe.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Now here we see the Bible is saying here
[2:11:32] that Hezekiah loved the Lord with all OF
[2:11:35] HIS HEART. WHAT did he do? This was the
[2:11:38] very same man
[2:11:40] that exposed the Babylonians to all the
[2:11:43] treasure.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; That Israel had.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; This was a very same man. But yet THE
[2:11:50] BIBLE SAYS HE LOVED THE LORD with all of
[2:11:53] his heart. You know when when Ezekiah
[2:11:55] became king, the first thing what he did
[2:11:58] was that he got rid of all idolatry in
[2:12:01] Israel. He was the one that got rid of
[2:12:04] the brazing serpent
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; because the people had make it an idol
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; and THAT THING PLEASES GOD.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; So people we have to understand that uh
[2:12:14] that is the thing that that that capture
[2:12:17] the Lord.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; That's that's THE THING THAT GRAB his
[2:12:20] attention when we get TO THE PLACE WHERE
[2:12:23] OUR DAILY LIFE PLEASES the Lord. not in
[2:12:26] all the little thing that we do. What of
[2:12:28] God whether for us to eat meat or eat
[2:12:31] salad and and all of these it's not it's
[2:12:33] not in those things.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; It's in their eyes. The Bible says here
[2:12:44] in in second king chapter 18 and and and
[2:12:47] when and uh and and he did that which
[2:12:50] was right in the sight of the Lord. Uh
[2:12:53] beautiful verse three. I call into all
[2:12:55] that David all that David his father
[2:12:58] did. He removed all the high places. He
[2:13:01] break the the images cut down the grove.
[2:13:04] He break in pieces the brazen serpent
[2:13:06] that Moses has made. For onto those days
[2:13:09] the children of Israel did burn incense
[2:13:11] unto it and call it
[2:13:15] Nahushing.
[2:13:16] No,
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; he trusted in the Lord God of Israel. So
[2:13:20] that that after him was none like unto
[2:13:24] him among all the kings in Judah. It was
[2:13:27] just IN DESTROYING THE THE PASSION THAT
[2:13:29] he had
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; to do what is right.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; The passion he had to do what is right.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; You never know the thing that you would
[2:13:42] do
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; that would please the Lord.
[2:13:47] Amen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; It would just cap everything.
[2:13:51] God is not He's not going around and
[2:13:54] taking record book and just and says,
[2:13:56] "Okay, this morning since you woke up,
[2:13:58] okay, you didn't read your Bible yet."
[2:14:01] Oh, that's that's not the love of God.
[2:14:06] That's not the love of God. Who do that
[2:14:08] to their children?
[2:14:12] Who do that to their children? Who do
[2:14:13] that to their wives?
[2:14:18] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; AND HOW CAN THE ALMIGHTY GOD DO THAT TO
[2:14:22] US?
[2:14:31] That's the reason why every given
[2:14:33] opportunity,
[2:14:35] LET'S GIVE OUR BEST. LET'S GIVE OUR ALL
[2:14:38] TO IT.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[2:14:44] was a man. He was a generous man. HE WAS
[2:14:48] A VERY GENEROUS MAN.
[2:14:51] And there was one act that he did. God
[2:14:55] sent an angel and said, "Go down to his
[2:14:57] house.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Tell him his arms has reached up to me."
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; I've seen his generosity.
[2:15:08] I've seen his generosity.
[2:15:17] We love the Lord with all of our heart.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; It's not in the dos and don't people
[2:15:22] [clears throat]
[2:15:23] is in the law for his word.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; When we are failing and and everything
[2:15:30] is FALLING APART AND AND THINGS ARE
[2:15:32] GOING wrong and the word of God comes on
[2:15:36] the scene,
[2:15:38] it will not be difficult. You don't go
[2:15:40] into frustration
[2:15:45] that I was I trying to do my best. I was
[2:15:47] doing it and and everybody and this is
[2:15:50] no no you don't go into frustration.
[2:15:54] You don't get into argument with God.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:08] You will you would think that Mary said
[2:16:12] unto the Lord, be it unto me. I calling
[2:16:15] to the word.
[2:16:17] Oh, she should have HAD THE BEST
[2:16:20] WEDDING, the best marriage experience.
[2:16:23] But when she got to the to the temple
[2:16:25] that day,
[2:16:27] when Simeon took the little baby, he
[2:16:30] prophesied.
[2:16:32] Say, as he swore going through your
[2:16:33] heart,
[2:16:36] as he swore going through your heart.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:16:52] THAT JUST AFTER THREE YEARS, THREE AND a
[2:16:54] half years,
[2:16:56] this child that she had and and this
[2:16:59] experience that she had that that that
[2:17:01] kind OF A PUT HER INTO THE PAPERS AND
[2:17:04] AND PUT HER LIFE TO A PLACE AND ALMOST
[2:17:07] LIKE A stand still.
[2:17:12] Right before her eyes,
[2:17:15] he'll be hang between the heaven and the
[2:17:17] earth.
[2:17:20] He be called illegitimate child.
[2:17:24] Praise the Lord.
[2:17:28] Amen.
[2:17:30] You know this is some of those things
[2:17:32] where uh you go through those life
[2:17:34] experience. It looks like uh uh uh
[2:17:37] sometimes that uh it was it was even
[2:17:40] better for me to for me to have have not
[2:17:42] married
[2:17:44] then for me to marry and he'd be gone so
[2:17:46] soon
[2:17:49] and he be dead
[2:17:51] or something happened.
[2:17:54] Praise the Lord. when when we starts to
[2:17:57] look into that purpose when I share with
[2:17:59] you you will understand it that God mind
[2:18:02] when Paul says a marriage is a mystery
[2:18:04] of God in in Ephesians chapter 5 is more
[2:18:08] it's it's far beyond some of the things
[2:18:10] that we take I mean we take the word of
[2:18:12] God and and we cut it into bit and
[2:18:14] pieces just to to to cover our loose
[2:18:17] holes
[2:18:20] we have to understand that God has a
[2:18:23] purpose for our life.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; He has the purpose and he's the one that
[2:18:29] is steering the wheel. You don't have
[2:18:31] the will in your hands.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; You don't have the wheel of time in your
[2:18:35] hands.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; And some things and everything that God
[2:18:41] allowed in our life is for the purpose
[2:18:43] is to bring character through us. And if
[2:18:45] we are not building character, we are
[2:18:47] not meeting that purpose.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I learned that's the
[2:18:52] reason why the psalm David said precious
[2:18:54] in the sight of the Lord is the death of
[2:18:57] the sin. It is not the dying that is
[2:18:59] precious. It is because that has is
[2:19:02] precious because that person has met
[2:19:04] their purpose.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; The person has met their purpose. They
[2:19:13] have lived out their purpose.
[2:19:17] And because they have made their
[2:19:19] purpose, their design, the very reason
[2:19:21] why God sent them out there, that is the
[2:19:23] reason why it's precious in his sight.
[2:19:27] It's precious that now he can pick them
[2:19:30] home
[2:19:32] because he have fulfilled or they have
[2:19:34] fulfilled their purpose.
[2:19:39] So just like uh uh uh uh uh uh just like
[2:19:44] [snorts]
[2:19:45] [clears throat]
[2:19:46] just like uh Rebecca. So this bride is
[2:19:50] at that place.
[2:19:52] She's is at this place and all she want
[2:19:55] to hear is Eliza tell me more
[2:20:00] because the more I'm hearing of the word
[2:20:02] the more is building faith in me. The
[2:20:05] more I'm hearing of the word, the word
[2:20:07] is changing me.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; THE MORE SHE'S HEARING ABOUT ISAAC AND
[2:20:11] WHERE ISAAC LIVE, THE MORE SHE'S
[2:20:14] FORGETTING about where she came from.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. TELL ME ABOUT THE
[2:20:19] PLACE. ARE THERE HILLS? ARE THERE
[2:20:21] RIVERS?
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Oh man, there's a long stream of river
[2:20:24] and then I mean there are mountains and
[2:20:27] mountains. AND THE MORE SHE'S HEARING
[2:20:29] ABOUT THAT, THE MORE SHE'S forgetting
[2:20:31] about where she came from.
[2:20:34] Praise the Lord. AND THE MORE WE GET IN
[2:20:37] THE WORD, THE WORD of God is the more
[2:20:39] that this word is letting loose of us.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; It's not getting grip on us. AND THE
[2:20:44] MORE THE DESIRE OF THIS word is losing
[2:20:48] us.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we are falling in love with
[2:20:51] another land. We are falling in in in
[2:20:54] love with another place.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are falling in love. A better
[2:21:03] place where there's no sickness, there's
[2:21:05] no pain. We says, "Come, Lord Jesus. Oh
[2:21:08] my God, what is it going TO BE? WHAT AM
[2:21:10] I GOING TO DO WITH 1,000 YEARS on my
[2:21:12] hands?
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; I can't wait to get to eternity." The
[2:21:16] more we fall in love with heaven, the
[2:21:18] more earth is letting loose.
[2:21:22] Earth knows that it does not have grip
[2:21:24] on us anymore
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; because our heart is falling in love
[2:21:28] with a place that we are hearing in the
[2:21:31] word is sounding to us. Praise the Lord.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to build down here. I
[2:21:39] want to I want to take one more thing
[2:21:40] again and just and just put a nail to
[2:21:43] the coffin.
[2:21:45] Bury the devil. Amen.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Coffin are never supposed to be nailed
[2:21:49] when people are in it. But we got to
[2:21:51] nail this one because we don't want him
[2:21:53] to come out.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; One more nail.
[2:21:58] I was just sharing this uh uh brother
[2:22:02] Ariel last night talking about this.
[2:22:04] Listen to this. Brother Brandon said
[2:22:06] talking message [clears throat]
[2:22:08] the four obedience
[2:22:11] for obedience to the whole word of God.
[2:22:16] I preached this many years back
[2:22:19] and uh uh remember one time I was
[2:22:22] talking about this uh uh in in Elsia
[2:22:25] back home. Full obedience to the whole
[2:22:27] word of God
[2:22:29] to God's entire word will entitle you
[2:22:34] to this talking.
[2:22:37] How do you do it? That my question is
[2:22:40] that for obedience, if you get full
[2:22:42] obedience, then what do you need a token
[2:22:44] for?
[2:22:49] But say four obedience will entitle you
[2:22:51] to the token. What does he means? It
[2:22:55] takes the token to give you four
[2:22:57] obedience.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU GET FULL OBEDIENCE BEFORE
[2:23:01] YOU GET THE TOKEN?
[2:23:05] How can you?
[2:23:09] It's the talking that gives you full
[2:23:11] obedience. The token is the Holy Ghost.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; That's why gave you full obedience.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; But see what he says. He says, "How do
[2:23:20] you do it?
[2:23:22] How do you love the Lord with all of
[2:23:24] your heart?
[2:23:26] How do you It says in practicing the
[2:23:28] word." No,
[2:23:32] he says, "How do you do it?" Look, watch
[2:23:33] this now. He says here, "How do you do
[2:23:36] it?" Peter said on the day of Pentecost,
[2:23:39] "Repent, every one of you, and and be
[2:23:43] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:23:46] for the remission of your sin, and you
[2:23:48] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:23:50] Ghost, the token."
[2:23:53] So, full obedience to what?
[2:23:57] for obedience to repent and be baptized.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; But you see how it set for obedience to
[2:24:06] the entire word.
[2:24:10] That's how it looks like. It looks like
[2:24:12] you got TO OBEY THE WHOLE WORD, THE
[2:24:15] WHOLE WORD OF GOD BEFORE YOU CAN GET to
[2:24:16] talking.
[2:24:18] But that's not what he's saying here.
[2:24:21] HE'S SAYING FOR OBEDIENT TO WHAT PETER
[2:24:24] said on the days of Pentecost, REPENT
[2:24:26] AND BE BAPTIZED. THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE
[2:24:29] TOKEN.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? SO, IT'S NOT FULL
[2:24:39] OBEDIENCE TO EVERYTHING THAT IS IN A
[2:24:41] MESSAGE. NO. BECAUSE IF YOU CAN FULLY
[2:24:45] OBEY EVERYTHING THAT IS IN the word,
[2:24:47] then you don't need the Holy Ghost. If
[2:24:49] you can DO IT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST,
[2:24:51] then you don't need it.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; But you cannot do it without the Holy
[2:24:54] Ghost.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost COMES WHEN YOU FULLY
[2:24:58] OBEY ACTS 2:38.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU FULLY OBEY ACTS 2:38, YOU WALK
[2:25:09] DOWN THE SCRIPTURE, REPENT, be baptized
[2:25:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus CHRIST,
[2:25:14] AND THEN HE PROMISED TO GIVE YOU THE
[2:25:16] HOLY GHOST.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh man.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; You see, SO IT IS JUST ONE thing
[2:25:26] that YOU THAT YOU HEAR, YOU RECEIVE, YOU
[2:25:28] FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. I BELIEVE THAT IS
[2:25:30] THE TRUTH. And you gave your heart to
[2:25:33] it.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; When the word says it,
[2:25:37] you don't do it out of duty.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; You do it out of love.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; You do it out of love.
[2:25:46] You fall in love with him. You throw
[2:25:49] yourself in the arm of the word. That
[2:25:52] was what Rebecca did when she saw Isaac.
[2:25:55] The Bible says she jumped from the
[2:25:56] camel.
[2:26:00] Praise the Lord.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; You throw yourself right in the arm of
[2:26:04] the word. Be it unto me according to
[2:26:05] your word. Lord, give me strength. This
[2:26:08] this this I've just heard really hit me
[2:26:10] hard. I really need your grace in this
[2:26:12] area.
[2:26:15] Then you falling in love with God.
[2:26:18] You falling in love with the word. Say,
[2:26:21] "Lord, I I love you because you just
[2:26:23] know how to talk to me.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; You know how to get me to the point. I
[2:26:28] love you for that.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; You're not taking offense in the word.
[2:26:33] The word do not offend you."
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; Because pretty soon you make the
[2:26:37] preaching me,
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; You make the preacher the preacher. You
[2:26:41] make the word the preacher who he think
[2:26:43] he is. I'm nothing.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; But it's not me. It's the word.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; When the word says it, then we fall in
[2:26:51] love with it. God, give me grace.
[2:26:53] [snorts]
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; I know you can do it. Amen. If your word
[2:26:56] says it, I know that you can do it.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; You will not say something that you can
[2:27:02] do. If that's what you require of me,
[2:27:04] there is grace for me to fulfill it.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; And I just love you for that.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; I just love you for that. I would tell
[2:27:14] you never fail to tell God how much you
[2:27:18] love him
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; every day
[2:27:22] and never fail to tell the people
[2:27:27] around you how much you love him.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; If that is not your language,
[2:27:33] you better learn that.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Tell the people around you even It does
[2:27:43] not looks you know really really
[2:27:49] see how the Lord say is dry whether it's
[2:27:52] dry roasted it's fried
[2:27:57] give I love you
[2:28:01] praise the Lord
[2:28:03] when it's dry it will start getting wet
[2:28:05] it will start becoming flexible
[2:28:14] because we just we just reduce it. I
[2:28:16] mean that that that is the thing that is
[2:28:18] the thing that that's one of the
[2:28:20] strongest element in relationship that
[2:28:22] is the thing that is keeping us is the
[2:28:25] love of God
[2:28:29] is the love of God.
[2:28:32] Feeling his love
[2:28:34] in your heart. Feeling his love.
[2:28:39] Knowing that he love you.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; You're not defining it.
[2:28:46] But what we have and what we don't have
[2:28:49] and what is there and what is not there,
[2:28:51] we're not defining it by. But we know
[2:28:54] there
[2:28:57] love you. Come walk me.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:29:02] Come one man. David said even if I made
[2:29:05] my bed in hell
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; behold he is dead.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; So sometimes right in our mess and right
[2:29:16] in our weaknesses
[2:29:18] God love is speaking to our heart. But
[2:29:21] we because we feel so shamed and
[2:29:23] condemned is it's hard for us to even
[2:29:25] embrace his love
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; in our failure
[2:29:31] because we think that it must be on our
[2:29:33] best term. No. While we were yet
[2:29:36] sinners,
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; why we were yet sinners,
[2:29:44] he loved us. When love projects,
[2:29:50] when love projects,
[2:29:54] it must be received.
[2:29:56] And when that projected love is
[2:29:58] embraced, then the grace of God take you
[2:30:02] from here
[2:30:04] and starts to
[2:30:06] work in your life.
[2:30:10] Praise the Lord.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come.
[2:30:28] Oh man, what law projects?
[2:30:37] Oh man,
[2:30:41] tell me more.
[2:30:47] Well, Isaac really looks like

[2:30:57] him.
