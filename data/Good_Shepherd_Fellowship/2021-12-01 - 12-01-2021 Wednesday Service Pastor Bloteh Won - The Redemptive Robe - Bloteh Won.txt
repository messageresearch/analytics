supposed to be testified of your deliverance you're supposed to be testified of your holy ghost don't wait for me to testify that you have the holy girls i don't know i know of mine amen you must be testifying if you were there you ought to know praise the lord amen oh my praise the lord amen amen what almighty god himself he's a mighty god he's a faithful god let's turn to the book of trinity tonight i have a little thought i want to share that will be in in first timothy chapter 2 praise the lord amen i was talking with a brother [Music] just a week before i traveled and we were talking about some few things you know and and then he he said is to me you know uh uh that he was he was sharing with with another brother you know that uh uh on the book of on the book of hebrew you know and it says uh you know uh uh know now in the book of hebrew naturally on the book of hebrew he was sharing uh with the brother and he says he says uh paul was a prophet you know and and this and this uh individual i've already backslided from the message so he says well you want to say that because brother branham said it you know and and and the brothers say yeah uh you know uh because i believe brother branham is a prophet you know he said by then you can prove it to me in the scripture you know and uh and the brother says well i believe what the prophet said you know and and as much as i respect his earnest and as much as respect you know him saying that uh uh what the prophet said i also felt like uh it was it was it was almost the same of of if you remember dr is that dr rafi that came to see brother branham when he met that muslim man and the muslim man challenged him and says if your jesus is raising he said the works that you do you will do the same work he said when he fixed that challenge he said brother branham i thought of you praise the lord and i felt the same in my heart i just thought that uh well i wish that i had the opportunity uh i was going to show that brother right in the pages of the bible that paul is a prophet not only that brother branham said it but i've also believed that brother branham said it because the scripture teaches so amen so because of that i've been kind of for taking some time to to see if i will i will find find the way of the law to speak on the first prophet messenger to the gentile age but that's not what i would do tonight that's not what i would do tonight i would just i'll take a little talk here so we can be able to have some time to pray but i really been praying about it and been asking the lord to to to just uh give me the leadership and and for me to be able to share some things why we believe that paul was a prophet from the message and also from the scripture because i believe it's right in the bible amen praise the lord i believe he's writing the bible when we talk among ourselves as message believers and people that appreciate this message you know is we we can we can you know just uh quote the prophet and everything but when a person does not believe the message and you start with the prophet i mean you're just hanging them that's right i mean you you're i mean you you you're creating uh committing a serious crime you you kind of hanging that person you're either drowning them under the water or you're hanging them on the rope it would just be better you just shoot them don't don't kill them like that praise the lord but let's read the scripture tonight that would be first timothy chapter 2. let's read from verse 13. let's read from verse 13 and if i would do justice let's read from verse 11. verse 11 let let the women let the woman learn in silence wave all subjections now you have to realize that a suggestion is different from submissions praise the lord they might they might have some sense of similarity but with what paul is talking about here he's talk he's going to talk about authority that's why he's using subjections praise the lord so he says uh uh but a softer not a woman to teach not to assume authority so you see why he used subjection and not submission the lord i suffer not a woman to teach not to assault authority over man but to be in silence for adam was first formed than eve and adam was not deceived praise the lord but the woman being deceived was in the transgression amen let's ask blessing tonight heavenly father is good to be in the house of the lord and oh god we can't bring in our hearts lord father you know exactly where i took this thought from lord god and i felt so blessed and i just prayed i said lord if it please you and that i can be able to share it with the church i just pray that you'll put blessing upon it oh god i'm not i'm not going to come lord father as a smart teacher tonight i just want to humble myself before you and say lord how much we need you this very hour come lord and set us aside lord come and deal with us tonight come and speak to us lord come and bring some reality father lord god out of the pages of your word that will be a blessing to us we love you we appreciate your father bless us together now lord we that are here in the building and those lord fathers that are also with us lord or god streaming into the service lord and them that are with us in the spirit praying we ask that lord you just bless us together in jesus name father we would take brother uh elijah on spoken prayer request we pray that father you will you will meet him at that very point of his need oh god in every every request on spoken prayer requests in the building tonight the the desires of your children their needs in our lives oh god and in our home and in our affairs we just commit them to you tonight what a faithful god you are what a loving father we bless your name lord in the name of jesus we pray amen amen the lord bless you tonight you may have your seed amen praise the lord the bible says and adam was not deceived you see this this particular scripture uh many many of us around the message try to use that as some sense to escape the fall and to blame eve and blame the woman for the fall we tried to use that the bible said the man was not deceived it was a woman that was deceived and most of the time when people approach this subject especially us around the message it is just a concept it is just a theological concept geological uh to logic means and knowledge of god so you don't have to go to seminary you know to to have a theological concept it's because we've been taught and and and and in the way that we understand genesis chapter 3 make us to come to that conclusion praise the lord you know uh uh uh the the the woman was deceived the man was not deceived but i want to approach it different tonight and tell and and tell you tonight that uh uh if you if you look at it and you bring it to uh to to the justice you bring it to the justice of god if you deal with this subject and deal with it to the justice of god you will realize that the justice of god report on a person that is deceived and the justice of god we condemn a man that will walk open eyes into sin and that's what adam did if you approach it on god's justice god justice will forgive someone that is deceived because they were deceived they were literal then the person that will walk willingly knowing that this is wrong and that's what adam did yes so if you think because you are a man and you represent adam so it makes you proud that adam was not deceived i would tell you the justice of god will condemn you if you know that something is wrong and you walk with consciousness into it the justice of god condemned you god would be more merciful to a person that was deceived they were deceived because they were little they were tricked into believing that it was true praise the lord did i throw you off tonight i can tell when you are thinking when the building gets quiet then i know your wheels are spinning praise the lord amen glory be to god amen you see when we read the scripture in this way and and and we just we just read it in in a in in a surface you know in a surface approach or in a shadow approach we turn to lost the divine concept that is in the scripture praise the lord amen adam was first formed in eve you see this this is uh this is just a uh uh a place of sequence adam was first formed in eve does that have to do with anything that has to do with one being superior and the other one being inferior praise the lord amen it doesn't have to do with that and adam was not deceived by the woman being deceived was in the transgression praise the lord amen now standing she shall be safe and childbearing if they continue in the faith and charity and holiness with subreddit now now paul says here she shall be saved in childbearing and he says if they continue in the faith praise the lord not if she continues in the fight but if they continue in the faith so right here paul is now actually separating the man from the woman he's keeping both of them together praise the lord he's keeping both of them together glory be to god tonight tonight i will speak on the redemptive rope the redemptive rob as we read you will see exactly that i took this this is this is uh right in the court here brother branham called it the redemptive rock and the way i think about it is the other uh uh the redemptive rob is is the love of god amen is the love of god when a person is able to go an extra mile jesus said if they ask you to go in my go to redemptive rock what makes you to bear with people amen redemptive raw what makes you to cover the multitude of sin and only talks about the good that you know about the person and not not not trying to be smart and destroying people character no redemptive rob will not do that and every time a person try to do that you're only trying to make yourself good every time you try to gossip or tell something about somebody unconsciously you're telling the person that i'm better than that person praise the lord that's what you are doing amen redemptive rob would not do this as we look at the subject we realize that god by grace uh uh uh uh he has put a redemptive rob upon you and myself amen that while we were yes sinners yes sir christ died for our sin amen yes thank you we realized that in edem he brought a redemptive rob to adam and say adam adam where are you and and god was seeking him uh to be able to dress him in that righteousness but he was conscious of his wrong and he was running away from god you know but yet we will see it as we go along let's let's read a little bit here this will be able to set the the you know the the place for us to go tonight by the grace of god amen are we together praise the lord are you with me tonight yes amen now brother brahm took this in the message position of a believer in christ you see adam sinned it and condemned and was driving from the garden of eden by god now he's establishing the thought because he's about to say something so he's establishing the thought that adam committed sin amen what he did was wrong and and and and and and because it was wrong he was condemned it was that condemnation that make him to hide himself from god and and both of them were driven from the garden of eden he said see their redemptive rob over him showed that there was some redemptive roar that was placed on him it shows that he seemed because if he never seen it he don't need redemption he don't need it to be covered are we together praise the lord he says well what i said adam's sin wayfully praise the lord adam's sin wayfully are we together oh praise the lord and uh you see yeah i started on this on the subject some time ago and i was i was really not able to to get back to it but a strange thing when i got out there i was i was actually i was actually preaching on that amen but if the lord uh help us maybe one of these days we will we might be able to to get back to death if god will give us grace now the scripture says here in hebrew chapter 10 let's go back let's go to hebrew chapter 10. in hebrews 10 verse 26 the bible says for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth they are remaining no more sacrifice for sin amen and brother brandon is saying adam's sin wayfully are we together let's read a bit let's read a little bit i said adam saying wavefully see eve was this eve was actually deceived but adam was not deceived he deliberately sinned praise the lord now you remember in the book of acts there was a prophet called agabus and and and i got boss when when paul was down there in phillip house and uh uh they were having a meeting and philip young daughters he had four girls and and and and those girls i mean they were they were virtuous young girl filled with the holy ghost and they had the gift of god upon their life you know uh uh and agapos came there and and and he prophesied you know he took paul uh uh uh you know uh rob the thing that goes elijah goes around his rope and say the man that has this you know he had it and he says you know his hands will be bound his hands his feet will be bound and and he prophesied thou said the lord he said change a witty praise the lord and yet with all that prophecy paul was still determined to go back to jerusalem so what can we say paul willfully went into prison he willfully walked into what he suffered because a word has been given the prophecy was given thou said the lord chains and with the man that have this are we together so brother branham is also bringing adam into the same situation that he deliberately eve was deceived oh thank god the church is eve amen i thank god i i i thank god that i'm eve tonight so you want to be proud of being adam you go right ahead because he that sin willfully [Laughter] that's the lord of god adam seemed willfully eve was actually deceived by adam was not deceived he deliberately seen he deliberately ignoring what he was doing because of his wife praise the lord the reason that people can be able to think whether i should forgive her or not is because there are plenty of women around them amen they can start making options in their mind praise the lord that thought never crossed out of mine and i never thought in his mind well okay now you have done this let me let me think about it you give me some time let me think about it adam had no time to think amen he had no time to think he never considered another option in his mind so say well okay the prophet said well i can marry but i have to marry virgin you know the prophet say you know i i can married if she do this i can put her away and get another wife and we start looking for all the cod codes and looking for all the quotes in the message because we have options praise the lord we find code to get ourselves in trouble then we find courts to bear ourself out but one day we will realize that's not the reason why god gave us a message the message was far away to do with you building yourself out and and you know uh finding a license to do this and finding the code you can tack on your back the one you can pull right to your door so when people come they can read it straight and make sure they are colored standing and dress butting their shirt and everything you just put the entire church order right to your door that's that was not what the coats were giving for this message is christ in us the hope of glory praise the lord that's what this message is is christ in you the hope of glory yes amen he deliberately seen knowing what he was doing because of his wife he took position with his wife then they went before god and both of them was condemned praise the lord amen sarah came to abraham and said what i haven't met here and and and you've been talking about a son and and and you know abraham we have waited we have waited why if you know why if uh uh uh you know uh the the promise was actually spiritual and you were looking at it physical well this may she's my daughter so she's just like me if she have the child it's my child she's in my house i raised her i fed her and she gave all of the reason all of the reason man when people want to do wrong that's when they can be revelated it can just be flooring and they can connect this with they can connect it with this other when they're connected with this you see what i'm saying you see it is it cleared and you remember the gate i mean they can just connect and connect and connect and then when uh uh uh praise the lord so we see here when ishmael was born genesis chapter 16 let's look there a little baby amen are we together praise the lord when people want to do wrong and and sometimes it's it's not uh you know sometimes it's not a sinful thing it's it's just that when a person wants to have their will when they want their will to be to be to prevail and and and and they want to they want to they want to cover it up with scriptures and cults and ideas they have a way of driving their home praise the lord solomon says that person is a taber i mean he knows how to talk even saying you see when this one happened then you watch it and when you watch it and come down and watch it with this other one you know and it bring all those kind of a connection now we realize here in in genesis chapter 16 the bible says we we dealt with this the other time here uh now sarah abraham why bear him no children and and she hadn't made the egyptian whose name was higher and and sarah said on behold now the lord have restrained me from bearing i pray thee going on to my mid now and and and and and the bible says and abraham hacking to the voice of sarah now you you see here that abraham he has waited on god he's he will so for him to really yank into his wife which means she really pound him down with argument to convince him but as the story will go on and you can read the rest we know that the table turned haggar started having an attitude amen and in verse 5 the bible says and sarah said unto abram my wrong be on thee i have given my maid into that boson and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord george between me and thee praise the lord why does she what is she doing now she realized uh uh that the after effects she's coming back to the law she's coming back to the word but on the prophecy she says my wrong be on thee are we together and then as you read on you'll realize that when uh uh uh [Music] abraham and then and and and his wife you know was she was trying to pull i got a wayne and and abraham was trying to appeal to her no don't do it you know what she's she's scaring the child the lord came down to abraham says listen to your wife are we together now so as we look at this redemptive rock you you'll realize that it's not one that a man made is one that god himself made from the foundation of the word he dress it in his mind he's he faction is in his mind for his people and let's go ahead here brother branham says here he says uh he took position with his wife then then they went before god and both of them was condemned adam chooses to be condemned with his wife he choose mad to make her a lesser person he choose not to make her feel guilty but to also you know uh partake in in what has happened praise the lord you realize that that is the same place the scripture brings us to when the bible says confess your fault one unto another the reason why that is good is because it brings both of you on on a level you know a level plane you know there is no one righteous person in the other person you really need god you really need god you did that you really need god you need the holy ghost no praise the lord but you see when we share our weaknesses with one another and we share that our struggle with one another praise the lord you see this it's an era of building confidence and that's the reason why we can share our struggle is because we look at this person to be more spiritual all we think what if i if i tell them now you know what uh they will go and tell somebody else and then everybody will look at me like that so we just keep the struggle in and we struggle with the struggle praise the lord by the way to build confidence is to be able to share our struggle with one another your struggle might not be a present moment it might it might be something that you went through and you think and and and and you and and when you share with the person it gave them an open door to realize oh wow oh wow god brought them through that praise the lord amen i remember one time long time ago a good friend of mine he was dealing with some things and you know we were talking and and and he he he asked me you know we are very good friends we talk you know we share things and then as we're walking and fellowshipping i realized that he wanted to say some things to me in a way that his language was going the way he was talking so he said he asked me the question he said brother one he says since you be essentially following the lord have you ever failed i said oh yeah brother yeah i i i i can say i can stay imagine in my mind when i said that to him the kind of a relief that i brought to him he said oh wow then pretty soon he find you know the comfort to start sharing what he wanted to share with me and we know we were talking and all of that so we we as we went further and then he says he says uh he says how was your experience i said brother we fall every day he said oh wow i never thought about it like that he said oh wow i never thought about it like that you know and and but we are we we have already got ourselves engaged in the conversation you know then he trusted me and we were we were talking about that but you see i'm just talking about the complex that people have and sometimes we build that complex praise the lord we build that complex that's the reason why when you want to help a fallen brother the best way to do it is to start to testify to him some of the things that the lord has done in your life and some of the places that god has brought you from then in that way you are building confidence amen verb adam says and jesus not ignorant of what he was doing oh my goodness oh my goodness you mean he also seemed wavefully and jesus not ignorant of what he was doing he came down and and and and took his place with the sinner the church that he might redeem the church back to god praise the lord but you see he could not do that without eating with the publicans amen without being called the friend of sinners and the reason why he was called the friend of sinners is because he was not wiping his shoulders among them he was embracing them he was shaking their hand how are you he was not hi hi no he was called a friend of cena's yeah and you can only be called a friend when there is a sense of association praise the lord he took place with the sin of the church that he might redeem the church back to himself see i said it was a type adam was christ is the second adam where through the the the first adam all die true second adam all life praise the lord amen now you will understand the conversation brother brandon preached something and somebody went with the thought and says he said adam never seen it you know that's that's where this whole conversation is from so brother bannon is coming back and he re-addressing it no i did not say that adam never seen what i said was adam singer deliberately he walked into it praise the lord so he said i said it was a time because he was the type of the first adam and the second adam was god in flesh god that knew everything from the foundation of the word praise the lord so he knew it he knew what the price would be he knew he knew the evil that had been done but the misunderstanding was the thought that i said adam never seen but adam did sin but it did but he did it with his eyes wide open in timothy 3 they said that adam was not deceived that's what we read actually timothy 2 but the woman being deceived was in the transgression see eve actually thought it was right she thought it was right but adam knew it was wrong yes but satan deceived her but he he didn't deceive adam he knew it was wrong but because of the love of his wife which is the redemptive rob [Laughter] amen because of the love of his wife which is the redemptive rob amen and i believe also a woman can extend that redemptive rob on her husband i believe parents can stand a redemptive rob on their children i believe christians can extend their redemptive love on sinners praise the lord he knew he was wrong but because of the love of his wife he he represented himself with sin and was condemned by the sin praise the lord he represented himself with sin and was condemned by the same oh my are we together praise the lord i mean some sometimes like i said people just get into the surface of the scripture and and and sometimes the way people would talk about this you know uh uh and and and uh they just they make eve to just be a kind of a filtered woman you know they make her to be a seducer they make her to be no she was deceived that's what the scripture said amen if she was not deceived she would not do it when the serpent approached her what she knew was what she said no the lord god told us not not to even touch it she defended the word the lord so she was not walking around his uh skin tight she was not doing things to seduce the serpent she was deceived are we together now you will see why paul in romans chapter 5 let's go there in romans chapter 5 paul being the prophet of god he's holding the word of god which is god's justice so in romans chapter 5 verse 17 the bible says amen from verse 12 wherefore as by one man sin enter into the word and death by sin by one man now you see all true year romans chapter 5 the book of justification you rea you realize that paul never mentioned a woman he never said but one woman seen enter the word why because she was the thief this is the man that was guilty the one that had his eyes open and went into doing the wrong he was the one that was guilty praise the lord all glory be to god amen don't come tell me about the one i was deceived praise the lord unless you are wanting to be deceived oh brother why i was deceived praise the lord i mean if eve knew what you knew if eve knew what you have been taught she wouldn't have done what happened so don't come to me and tell me say i was deceived or taken in as as your car to play now so paul said as as by one man sin entered into the word and death by sin and saw death passed on to all men one man and that man was adam praise the lord one man all glory be to god tonight are we together for until the lord seen sin was in the word but uh sin was not imputed when there was no law now so you see paul is dealing with this by the law of god he's dealing with this by the lord of god not by uh uh that i'm not he knows everything about genesis what happened the center the the the serpent was more he used that in the book of of corinthians just like the septuagint deceived e the serpent is deceiving the church he used that but yet he's looking at the law of god when you hold the lord of god the lord of god must be more gracious to the one that was deceived because him that sin willfully after he had received the knowledge of the truth they remain a normal sacrifice praise the lord you see that's the reason why adam had to find a fake leaf he did not he cannot bring any more sacrifice that will be accepted god had to provide one for him praise the lord amen glory be to god amen but when it came to christ he himself was the sacrifice [Music] why because he took on sin he identified with sin but sin never corrupted his blood he associated himself with the people he became the friend of sinners he was our redeemer the lover of our soul but it did not corrupt him so he became his sacrifice praise the lord god could look upon him and see the sin of the word and god could look upon him and also see the sacrifice of the word oh glory be to god by one man sin entered into the word nevertheless death reigned from from adam to moses even all of them that that are nothing after the similarities of adam's transgression now you see he's using the same word that he said the woman was in the transgression he's bringing that same war here to adam after adam's transgression who is a figure of him that was to come which is christ but not as the offense so also is the free gift verse 16 and that as it was by one that seen it so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation for about one man offends death reign by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one so you see where we're going tonight well that taught off the redemptive rob verbatim goes down he says and christ represented himself with his church full of sin and was condemned and his soul went to hell amen and god raised him up on the teddy you believe that see it wasn't it wasn't dead he did sin it wasn't that he didn't sin he did sin god who have seen him who have sent him to hell hell a god wouldn't have sent him to hell pill he had to send him to hell condemned because he took our sin upon him praise the lord and christ died not righteous christ died as sinner see christ never seen it himself but he took our sin on him he says any scriptural theologian teacher will know about the two gods and he comes back there now while god told moses about the scapegoat they take one goat they kill it put the blood on the other one and let him to go free praise the lord so christ was the two gods amen he was the guilty god and he was the sacrificial god are we together you see how the picture is coming together that's the redemptive rob people say the devil is escaped well he said no christ was both gods both death and resurrection amen he was both death and resurrection hallelujah so you see resurrection is now only an evening resurrection is a person that was what jesus tried to make matter to understand or merit to understand if you were here my brother wouldn't have died he said amen he will live again she said yes i know in the resurrection she was looking at the evening [Music] and he said no resurrection is not only uneven resurrection is a person i am the resurrection and the life praise the lord so you see there we we we we find that he represented death and resurrection glory be to god amen he had to die and and and rise again it was not just taking our sin upon him going on a cross and being nailed and suffering but he actually had to die because when the sea fall into the ground they have to die to genetize and come back up again and that's what god is doing in us it's not just joining the church it's not just uh no you you have that that seed have to die amen now all men have to die praise the lord amen anything of the flesh have to die anything of the sinful nature and sinful desire you have to die oh what a mighty god we self what a resurrection rob amen let me close this up tonight noah christ was both gods he was both death and resurrection you see and he bought i was i i was seen away and and and then uh come forth in the resurrection and so it was christ being represented for the church he took the church place for sin and was cast into ultra darkness in hell and rose again on the tear day praise the lord now see brother branham says something that you enjoy let's let's let's let's go quickly yeah he said rose again on the tear did god raise him up for our justification that's what paul is talking right here in romans chapter five he says and he he did that on the basis of one scripture he rose christ on the basis of one scripture you know and brother branham said that scripture was a backslider preacher or a box fly the man david in his backslaughter state and said lord i know you will not leave my soul in hell praise the lord glory be to god you see how god is mindful of us amen however state is now when we are on when we are on fire you know and we are revelating we are jumping up in the church and shouting all even when we are in the lower state and we are struggling and our heart is pouring out to god oh god i love you i need you he's my fault of that it attracts him it speaks to him one scripture of a minister who lit up backslided spoke the scripture david said i will not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to seek corruption praise the lord you see david year honor inspiration he says something crying out it's not it's not premeditated sometimes people pre-meditate to convince god that they are already sorry without pouring out their heart praise the lord he was pouring out his heart crying to god restore unto me the joy of my salvation take not your spirit away from me you are he was actually pouring out inside crying to god lord i really need you praise the lord but you see when david said this he said it in prophecy amen david being a shepherd born and being a man after god on heart that loved the lord he knew there was going to be a messiah but you see when david said this he was not thinking about the messiah it was not the messiah that was on his mind what was on his mind was the condition he was in he needed god back he needed god so desperately he wanted to go back to his all-time path his all-time prayer meeting his dedication to the word he was not thinking about the messiah oh you will not leave his soul in hell no he said lord you will not leave your holy one in hell so take not your holy spirit from me praise the lord he was crying to god and and and pouring out his heart to god but yet in the midst of that it was a prophecy because you see christ was the first fruit amen he was the first fruit from the dead that never saw corruption but you see after the resurrection of jesus christ no believer ever see corruption we don't see corruption why because we leave the body when it corrupts in the earth is the body that corrupts not the believer that corrupts that's right are we together but that was on the prayer that was on the prayer of one man that needed god so much that needed god so much praise lord saints let not this word just be a head knowledge where we love to hear certain things we love it being said certain way and yet we are far from the reality of god in our hearts when it really comes down to our desire when our preferences are laid on the table the desire for god and the holy ghost is at the end when we lay our preferences on the table what we would really want in this life the holy ghost is at the end because it had just become a concept to us it had just become a concept praise the lord the redemptive rob think about it he became sin for us a holy god knowing the justice of his word ignoring the justice of his word think about barabras i was looking for the gospel of barabas thing about barabas he knew that he was condemned he knew that the roman law condemned him to death and there was no way out he knew that praise the lord he knew that barabbas was not making plans for whatever he knew his fear his future ended right in that prison praise the lord he knew that's where his future ended because the romans was not going to spare him either for creating a religious riot a little bit to god but when barabas heard when barabas heard there was one that was going to take his place when he heard there was one that was going to take his place that he was actually going to be released you know the question in his mind who actually is this person who is this person praise the lord who is this person that is going to take my place you you me i'm going to be free you really mean i can start making plans for my life and that's the way we are that's where grace brought us from praise the lord being born in sin shipley in iniquity we will all be our bus we lie we cheat we lost but there was one praise lord amen you think barabbas walk from that prison where he showed her up he was he was confused because to him he have already settled with death in his mind if he had children he had talked to them he have advised them don't be like your father go to school be a good boy give them all the advice he repented to his wife i'm very sorry i let you down musicians you can come up tonight but you think about it young people think about it tonight a lot of the things that grace that this rock this redemptive rock could keep you from [Music] you just take it like a message you take it like a church you take it like a religion when i try it it's alive it's a life that wants to possess your being it's a life that wants to take you from your passions because now in your mind when you think about yourself and the way you think about your future how you're going to be a celebrity right now you feel to yourself that i mean the sky is your limit you can be like anything you want to be you can buy anything you want to buy that all the thing that goes through your mind [Music] brother barham said we have just become like a magnet in a 10 cent store that everything sticks on everything we see on youtube sticks on our body [Music] like a magnet in the 10 cent store [Music] everything we see on youtube [Music] we want to dress like this person want to fix our hair like this person fits our nose like this person [Music] well there is a rob a redemptive rob [Music]

looking for stars in your crown say god gave me one soul that i can lead to you i want to start in my crown now imaginary star you can look at this person and say by the grace of god the lord used me to bring them to the lord he's a star in my crown see when brother brother steve gave his uh tribute the other night he had only three minutes a lot of things he could say but he talked about the time he met brother scott and the life that was laid before him that led him to the message you're having the opportunity now as a young person to start laboring for that talking to your friend you don't have to be a preacher all you have to do is just create the atmosphere and invite them to church and encourage them but we think we are special and all we do is that we just condemn and condemn and
