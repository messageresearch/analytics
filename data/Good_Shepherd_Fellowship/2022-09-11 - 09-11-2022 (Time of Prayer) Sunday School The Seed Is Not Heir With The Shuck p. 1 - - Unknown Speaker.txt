the name of Jesus Christ the son of God Amen may be seated [Music] it's good tonight to be back here and I see we got a few standing around and I think the phones are open now of the many different cities Across the Nation San Francisco Tucson up in the east and we do the telephone send greetings to them we're in the auditorium here tonight and the main Auditorium is packed out the aisles and around the walls are standing full of people and we understand that tomorrow night we're going to try to open up another side here to the gym and get a larger Auditorium they'll take care of maybe a couple more thousand people so we're hoping that tomorrow night if it's filled up tonight the first night while we believe it'll be greater tomorrow night and I see this set in extra chairs and everything also tonight we're under great anticipations first the coming of the Lord Jesus the next the salvation of to Lost Souls that would receive him tonight and be ready for his coming when he appears I want to offer a special greeting and welcome to all these fine man on the platform which I understand many of them are ministers a couple hundred or more sitting on the platform and we're certainly thankful that they're here to all you people wherever you are in different parts of the nation and I understand that summer Year from across the sea overseas so we're grateful for you to be here to enjoy this fellowship with us which we're under anticipations that God is going to give us during this meeting it seems like that since I thought of coming back for these few days of meeting that my own heart has been alarmed strangely with a great feeling at something's just about to take place I don't know just what it is but I hope it is a great Revelation from God that'll will prepare us and make us better citizens of his kingdom while we're walking in this Dark World of sin and unbelief this ground tonight this very spot holds a great thing for me since I knew that they built this School auditorium here I have wanted to have a service in this place I'm very grateful to the school board and to those who graciously let us have it is upon this spot right about somewhere where this building stands tonight that a great thing took place some 30 years ago right on this same ground it was nothing but a broom Sage field at that time and I lived in a little house just beyond here about 200 yards I was very concerned in those days about the salvation of my father and mother which both are gone on tonight and especially in that day I was concerned about my father I remember I was sleeping on the porch it was warm summertime this is written I believe in the little book called Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever are either it was in a little book called I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and laying on the porch I suddenly was awakened and a burden come on my heart for my father as many of you people here of the city knew my father I think he was a great man though he was a sinner and but he had a bad habit that I've tried to fight against that thing as hard as I could through the age that's drinking that night he was drinking and I woke up with a great burden on my heart for Him and just with my pajamas on slipped on my trousers my pajama shirt left on I wandered out through this broom Sage field to just about where this stands now and I knelt down to pray for my father and while I was praying and asking God to save him and not uh to let him die a sinner that I loved him and while I was in prayer I raised up to look up towards the east from here and there was a vision and standing just above me many of you knows the vision was the Lord Jesus now I'm not allergic to Illusions as I know of but Visions are real and there stood the Lord Jesus the first time I'd ever saw him in a vision of that type he was just about oh probably 10 feet above my head standing in midair with one foot just making a step he had on a white garment friends around the side of it he had hair down to his shoulders he looked to be about a man about what the Bible said he was about 30 but a small thin built fellow very small looks like he wouldn't weighed over 130 pounds and I looked and I thought there were something that I might uh be wrong so I rubbed my eyes and looked up again and he was standing kind of sideways kind of a profile of his face and the looks of his face which have always seen in the Visions has been like Hoffman's head of Christ at 30. that's the reason I had that in my house on my literature wherever I can put that because that's the way it looked more like that only you seem to be small and uh so I was looking up at him I thought surely I'm not looking at my Lord standing there and I was kind of saying this position it may be right where this underwear this pulpit's at now somewhere it was right in this vicinity within whether a radius of where I'm standing the best I can measure off within 40 or 50 yards of somewhere around in this District here this circle and I looked up and he was standing there and I bit my finger to see if I was asleep you know how you it just seems like it couldn't be so and I was just young in the Lord then about six months I've been preaching I bit my finger I took a broom sage and broke it off at many of you people who live in the country don't want that little toothpick like is and the broom Sage I we're going to chew on that and I said it it can't be I'm a dreaming there's my home there's father mother and the children there there's the Old Brick House Pond that used to stand down here where I used to hunt Ducks just about 200 yards Beyond this and here I am standing in the field it's got to be sold uh kicked against the ground stomped my feet a little bit and shook my head and rung my hands looked up again looked away looked again and there he was standing there and the wind started to blow and I seen the broom Sage blowing and when it started blowing his garments blew with it like a clothes hanging on a line to begin to reflect uh he was standing there I looked at it and I thought if I could just get a look at his face and he was watching East right this away he's watching it intensely and I moved a step around to get a close look at his face and I still couldn't seem very well he had his hands in front of him rather hid from where I was standing I moved around again and I cleared my throat something like this I went to see if I could attract this tension but he never moved then I thought maybe I'll call him when I said Jesus he turned his head and when he looked at me he just raised his arms out that's all I remember for about a nearly daylight I was laying right out here somewhere where this place is now in the field my pajama shirt all wet with tears where I be crying and I had passed out his face had characters that no artist could could draw our paint they could not do it he looked like a man that he would look at him he wanted to cry with sympathy and respect with reverence and yet with enough power that would speak it would turn the world over and the characters could never be caught by an artist and I never know to this day what that meant but here I am tonight after 30 years standing in an auditorium it's dedicated now to the service of almighty God and me just a lay member really just a local Elder in the and Baptist Church here which Roy Davis was pastor at the time and I am now standing here with a place crowded right over the same grounds with the for what I think is the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ himself in my hands to bring this four days message of the Lord just about six months after that I had my first baptism down here on the river when the light came down right there Spring Street many of you people might want to go down take a look at it at Spring Street and water right at the riverfront and there's where the angel of the Lord appeared in public first and uh at two o'clock one afternoon a voice came from it said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming this is 30 years later and here I am still tonight proclaiming that message and around the world it's when and I'm glad to be back in my hometown tonight to represent this Lord Jesus Christ that I still love with all my heart each day he grows still sweeter than he was the day before I've never changed one iot in my Doctrine the first thing I started with I still believe the same thing tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever now I have a message that I'm responsible for when the message first started out it of course everybody is praying for the sick Great Signs wonders and miracles that started especially in the Pentecostal people a universal Revival of a healing campaigns that swept the world for 15 solid years there's been revivals on every Hill there he is I suppose Revival fires are burning literally millions have accepted Christ as their savior but that one commission that inspired from there to oral Robertson and so forth and on and on as this went around at the Pentecostal church was laying in his dead slump as it was then my intentions and desire tonight is to awaken that church again to the coming of the Lord Jesus at hand I have to rebuke it I have to rebuke sin in whatever manner it is I don't mean it to anybody's denomination I have a message now it's hard to get in a church for a sponsorship just as it was with our lord Jesus cause it's him it isn't me but as he preached at the first and healed the sick raise the dead he cleanse the lepers and cast out Devils everybody wanted him but there come a time where it is a message that always follows every sign because the sign has a voice but when he sat down one day and said I'm my father or one that was more than they could stand it was also when he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you how while doctors and well-thinking people would have said this man's a human vampire trying to get you to eat his flesh and drink his blood he never explained it he just said it tonight you might hear things and through the meeting is just said we're not I'll be able to explain but remember Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we believe now we don't have time to talk too much because we've got certain times to start here and certain times to get out and we want to honor the school board which set these times for us and we'll do all we can to honor them remember at any time a sinner wants to come to Christ all you have to do is walk right up whether I'm preaching singing Whatever it is and give your life to Christ right the understanding your seed that's what we're here for to help you I want to talk to brother Vale brother uh Robert uh borders and the Brethren here if I wonder if they couldn't have in the church in the afternoon or some morning or something instruction service for those who are seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost will that be all right you brother brother Neville and all that he could give to your brother if anybody wants to be instructed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost why don't you come to the Tabernacle what would be best morning morning about 10 o'clock about 10 o'clock of a morning if you got a question on the doctoring if you got a question on the message if you if you want to be you've never got ministered to personally you want to be prayed for or anything that you want to know and then matters why don't you just look down there at 10 o'clock in the morning and see these men there'll be one or more of them there to instruct to pray for the sick to answer questions this is a Personnel man with you you just uh go to them and they'll be glad to help you in any way they can now just before we approach the word we want to approach the author of the word again you might eat too much you might drink too much you might laugh too much you might walk too much but you'll never pray too much I would that man pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without doubt arrest let us pray dear Jesus author of the word of life and you are that word we solemnly now approach thee after the explaining of the vision that God you bear me record it that is true Lord Jesus I pray that you'll anoint the words tonight to the hearing of every ear that's under the Divine sound and if there be some here or listening in out Across the Nation if they are not ready and prepared at this hour to meet the challenge of the hour the message from God to repent and to be ready for the kingdom of God is nearing we pray that it'll be so tonight with them that they will meet this hour's challenge oh God I would pray for help knowing the responsibility and what it means and what I must answer at the day of the judgment for all that I say here and elsewhere help me to be deadly sincerely Lord with all that I do or say in Thy Word that it might bring forth fruit far as your commission was let not this word depart from thine mouth but meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observed to do all that's written in the law and then thou shall make thy ways prosperous and then thou shall have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and very courageous for the Lord thy God is with thee where so ever thou goest Lord Jesus make it so tonight we pray in Jesus name amen Friday and Saturday from 10 to 12 at the Tabernacle at 8th and Penn Street will be instructions answers to doctoring prayers for the sick and want more come right down if you have any question anything you need there'll be man there to to handle it the Lord bless you now for this opening service tonight I can't do nothing but open it straight to our message that's what we're here for and now it's what I come back for and Sunday morning the Lord willing I want to meet that great challenge of the day about marriage and divorce now in Galatians 4 27 I wish to read these words 4 27 to 31 inclusive for it is written Rejoice thou bearing that bearth not break forth and cry thou that travailth not for the desert has many more children than sea which has a husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born add to the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so is it now nevertheless what's saith the scripture cast out the bonds woman and her son for the son of the bonds woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not Children of the bonds woman but of the free the Lord had his blessings to the reading of his word now I believe here that I take a text like this very odd unusual [Music] foreign [Music]
