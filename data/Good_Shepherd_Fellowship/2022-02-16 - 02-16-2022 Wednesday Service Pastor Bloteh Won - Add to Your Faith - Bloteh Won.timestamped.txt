[1:08:14] peter yeah says
[1:08:16] in verse two grace and peace
[1:08:19] you know there's there's something i was
[1:08:21] i was uh looking at i was a kind of a
[1:08:24] looking at paul ministry
[1:08:26] and uh
[1:08:28] i never thought about it when i was
[1:08:30] reading this today but it just kind of a
[1:08:31] stick out to me
[1:08:33] yeah you realize that if you
[1:08:37] if you check
[1:08:39] your
[1:08:40] your bible and read your bible very well
[1:08:43] maybe i can give that to you as an
[1:08:46] assignment
[1:08:47] you realize that
[1:08:50] this is the only time
[1:08:52] that
[1:08:54] peter used the word grace
[1:08:58] he never used grace in all of his
[1:09:01] episode
[1:09:03] james never used grace
[1:09:07] praise the lord
[1:09:09] none of the apostles use grace
[1:09:12] beside paul
[1:09:16] praise the lord
[1:09:19] that's not what i wanted to talk about
[1:09:21] but let me just show you something i've
[1:09:22] kind of wrote some few notes on there
[1:09:25] as i was studying
[1:09:27] you know brother brandon preached a
[1:09:29] message called the message of grace
[1:09:32] he had the message of grace or he
[1:09:34] entitled his message the message of
[1:09:36] grace which of course that's what the
[1:09:39] message is
[1:09:40] but paul actually had the ministry of
[1:09:42] grace
[1:09:45] he had the ministry of grace
[1:09:48] now this this is uh
[1:09:50] this is something uh
[1:09:52] completely
[1:09:54] a little bit out of the blues tonight
[1:09:57] it just kind of for cut my
[1:10:00] my mind here
[1:10:04] as chapter 20
[1:10:09] as chapter 20.
[1:10:22] and it was almost like it was paul's
[1:10:25] signature
[1:10:28] through the entire through his entire
[1:10:31] episode
[1:10:34] he wrote 13 episodes
[1:10:37] and 13 is the number of a woman
[1:10:40] so he was the first messenger to the
[1:10:42] church that is a type of the bride
[1:10:45] and
[1:10:47] he wrote to seven churches
[1:10:53] he wrote to seven churches in his 13
[1:10:56] episode
[1:10:57] and uh a letter there to philemon and uh
[1:11:01] and but you look at you know the church
[1:11:04] there in rome the believers there in
[1:11:05] rome the ones in corinth the ones in
[1:11:09] galatia thessalonica and out of there he
[1:11:12] wrote seven seven episodes of the church
[1:11:16] he i mean if you just look at the way
[1:11:18] the holy spirit design it is is
[1:11:22] such a beautiful thing but let's let's
[1:11:24] read this verse right here
[1:11:26] i said uh
[1:11:29] uh what did i say
[1:11:33] ask chapter 20
[1:11:35] and uh
[1:11:39] let's read from verse
[1:11:40] 22 paul year was talking to the editors
[1:11:44] of the ephesian church age
[1:11:46] and uh
[1:11:47] he called them to a little island and he
[1:11:50] was kind of giving them some few
[1:11:52] instruction and last words
[1:11:54] because they won't see him anymore
[1:11:59] verse 22 he says and now behold a gold
[1:12:02] bound
[1:12:04] in the spirit unto jerusalem not
[1:12:06] ignoring the things that shall be
[1:12:09] forming there
[1:12:11] well he's saying not knowing because in
[1:12:14] himself he don't know
[1:12:16] but
[1:12:17] the uh agabus have already prophesied
[1:12:20] that bounce is waiting for him
[1:12:23] praise the lord
[1:12:25] amen but graham talks about that a
[1:12:27] little bit but i won't go into that
[1:12:29] uh tonight let me just stay where i am
[1:12:33] you know he says not ignoring the things
[1:12:35] that shall be for me
[1:12:38] he know that the holy spirit have
[1:12:40] already said to the man that have this
[1:12:42] you know this cult you know there there
[1:12:44] are bounds that is waiting for him but
[1:12:46] he did not you know he did not knew
[1:12:50] everything that would happen you know
[1:12:52] how everything would happen he didn't
[1:12:53] know
[1:12:54] but that uh paul just like he expressed
[1:12:57] in the book of romans he had such a
[1:13:01] burden
[1:13:02] for his people
[1:13:05] like he said in romans chapter 9 i wish
[1:13:08] you know i wish that uh
[1:13:11] uh you know there's a way i can say it
[1:13:13] to my people for them to understand
[1:13:17] that
[1:13:19] blindness
[1:13:22] in part has happened to us
[1:13:24] for the gospel to go on to the gentiles
[1:13:28] but you see that he was not he was not
[1:13:31] called actually for the jews
[1:13:33] even though
[1:13:34] he wanted to to to make them to
[1:13:37] understand you know and explain the
[1:13:40] ministry of jesus christ because that
[1:13:43] was the very thing that he persecuted
[1:13:47] praise the lord
[1:13:49] but
[1:13:50] the jews never forgive him for that they
[1:13:53] felt like he betrayed him
[1:13:57] praise the lord
[1:13:58] so every time the poor show up in
[1:14:01] jerusalem there was chaos
[1:14:04] there was riot
[1:14:06] they were ready to beat him they were
[1:14:07] ready to just say this man he's a
[1:14:09] betrayer
[1:14:12] praise the lord
[1:14:14] so that's part
[1:14:16] uh agavas has already prophesied
[1:14:20] paul
[1:14:21] was still wanting to go to jerusalem
[1:14:26] praise the lord it just shows how much
[1:14:28] he had his people on his heart okay
[1:14:30] let's just read a little bit here
[1:14:36] and now behold i go
[1:14:38] in bounds in the spirit unto jerusalem
[1:14:40] and not knowing the things that shall be
[1:14:42] for me
[1:14:43] said that the holy ghost witness in
[1:14:45] every city saying that bounds and
[1:14:48] affliction
[1:14:51] by me
[1:14:53] yeah he's testifying not knowing
[1:14:54] everything but the holy ghost witness
[1:14:56] you know there was prophecies you know
[1:14:59] in vision and people calling paul you
[1:15:01] know i had this vision but paul was
[1:15:03] still going
[1:15:09] but none of these things move me
[1:15:13] need account
[1:15:16] my life dear unto myself
[1:15:20] so that
[1:15:21] i might finish my cause with joy
[1:15:25] and the ministry
[1:15:28] and my finish my cause with joy and the
[1:15:31] ministry
[1:15:32] listen now the ministry which
[1:15:35] i have received of the lord jesus
[1:15:40] the ministry which i have received to
[1:15:43] testify
[1:15:44] the gospel
[1:15:46] of the grace of god
[1:15:50] so his ministry was to testify of the
[1:15:53] grace of god
[1:15:57] that's the reason why every episode that
[1:16:00] paul wrote it was his signature
[1:16:04] grace and peace the grace of god be unto
[1:16:07] you
[1:16:10] praise the lord
[1:16:15] and you'll realize you you know verb
[1:16:17] talk exposition uh a hebrew exposition
[1:16:21] when brother brown was teaching hebrew
[1:16:23] exposition and and and you read
[1:16:25] commentaries i mean there's this big
[1:16:27] argument there of who wrote the book of
[1:16:28] hebrew
[1:16:30] sure
[1:16:32] and paul was the one that wrote the book
[1:16:34] of hebrew
[1:16:37] praise the lord
[1:16:39] because
[1:16:40] but there was a reason why he did not
[1:16:43] identify himself
[1:16:45] why because he was
[1:16:47] he was writing that book to send it to
[1:16:50] the jews
[1:16:52] now if he says i paul the apostle they
[1:16:55] will not receive it
[1:16:57] sure
[1:17:00] so he disguised himself but you can
[1:17:02] still see his signature
[1:17:04] at the end of the book
[1:17:08] he closer with the grace of god
[1:17:13] [Laughter]
[1:17:15] praise the lord
[1:17:17] oh my
[1:17:18] what a messenger
[1:17:21] you know is it it intrigues me when
[1:17:23] brother branham said he preached why
[1:17:24] paul preached
[1:17:26] you know it's uh there was just there
[1:17:28] was just a whole lot of things there
[1:17:30] you know so he had that it was it was
[1:17:33] poor ministry
[1:17:35] there was nobody that did with the
[1:17:38] subject of grace
[1:17:42] like the way the apostle paul
[1:17:46] teach the grace of god
[1:17:49] praise the lord
[1:17:51] that's the reason why every church he
[1:17:53] rebuked them he rebuked the
[1:17:55] the galatians from
[1:17:57] from from uh uh from the false preachers
[1:17:59] that was trying to put them into
[1:18:01] legalizing and hold on to the lord he
[1:18:03] was studying and that is not what that
[1:18:05] is not your message
[1:18:08] who have deceived you all foolish
[1:18:10] galatians the very same thing that you
[1:18:12] have you are going right back to bind
[1:18:14] yourself into lord and legalism
[1:18:19] he cried to the corinthian church to see
[1:18:21] him the collusion church the same
[1:18:26] praise the lord
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:34] so that was paul ministry
[1:18:37] to testify
[1:18:40] of the gospel
[1:18:42] of the grace of god
[1:18:49] now so peter year used this word grace
[1:18:52] and peace
[1:18:53] and that's the only time he used it
[1:18:55] being multiplied onto you i mean i mean
[1:18:58] ii peter chapter 2 now be multiplied
[1:19:01] unto you through the knowledge of god
[1:19:04] and of
[1:19:06] our lord jesus praise the lord
[1:19:09] now you you uh you listening to uh uh uh
[1:19:13] statue of epiphany brother branham in
[1:19:16] reading this scripture year
[1:19:18] he talks a little bit of of of light
[1:19:21] precious faith
[1:19:22] you know he talks about peter greeting
[1:19:24] here he says uh peter greet them they
[1:19:27] have parting
[1:19:28] like precious faith
[1:19:30] you know and and and in dared in the
[1:19:32] church ages he he talks about you know
[1:19:35] you read the bible and and you read the
[1:19:38] foster books of mata then you see all of
[1:19:41] those things that uh you know the
[1:19:43] disciples here is paul that is saying
[1:19:46] you know even though they are
[1:19:47] prophesying everywhere word from the
[1:19:49] lord that bounds await me but none of
[1:19:51] those things move me you read all of
[1:19:53] those things and you see you it almost
[1:19:56] looks like man those guys they have
[1:19:58] faith they had they have they had an
[1:20:01] extraordinary faith
[1:20:03] the prophet god said peter year is
[1:20:06] identifying our faith that we have
[1:20:10] today
[1:20:12] with the
[1:20:16] effect he's saying to them that has
[1:20:19] light precious faith
[1:20:23] praise the lord
[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:26] and another thing that is there
[1:20:28] is to be able to appreciate
[1:20:32] how precious
[1:20:34] your faith is
[1:20:38] the bible says without faith
[1:20:40] it is impossible to please god
[1:20:44] he that cometh to god must believe that
[1:20:46] he is
[1:20:48] and we will look at that a little bit
[1:20:49] tonight with a few minutes that is
[1:20:51] before us i'm not i'm not preaching i'll
[1:20:53] just read a few verses here to make some
[1:20:55] coming that's what i'm doing
[1:20:58] but we would we just talk a little bit
[1:21:00] of how precious that faith is
[1:21:03] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:21:05] true the knowledge of god and and of the
[1:21:08] lord jesus i call into his divine i call
[1:21:11] him as his divine power

[1:21:57] godliness
[1:21:59] through the knowledge of him that have
[1:22:01] called us
[1:22:03] to glory
[1:22:05] and virtue
[1:22:08] whereby by giving unto us a sitting
[1:22:12] great
[1:22:13] and precious promises
[1:22:17] he has given us all things
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:24] and he has given us this great and
[1:22:26] and and uh great exceeding precious
[1:22:29] promises
[1:22:30] that by this year might be partakers
[1:22:34] the word particus year
[1:22:37] is is uh is is a word that hold the
[1:22:39] sense of partner
[1:22:44] which of course uh christ is the mystery
[1:22:46] of god revealed brother branham says
[1:22:48] that's what he have called us told
[1:22:52] to be joined here's with christ is to be
[1:22:54] partner

[1:23:15] reason why he wants you to express
[1:23:18] faith and through your faith he will
[1:23:21] work through their faith

[1:23:41] that is just higher to work
[1:23:44] just do your eight hours and
[1:23:46] go praise the lord you know there's
[1:23:49] there is there is there is completely
[1:23:52] different
[1:23:53] when a man is employed and he's just
[1:23:55] supposed to do his his his time eight
[1:23:57] five whatever hour and goal is complete
[1:24:00] when a man is a partner
[1:24:03] and he knows that he's a shareholder
[1:24:06] he's involved
[1:24:09] he worked beyond his eight hours
[1:24:13] when he's a partner he's he don't need
[1:24:15] to be taught
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:19] because he's a partner
[1:24:26] praise the lord
[1:24:29] paul use a word
[1:24:30] yeah but i i will i would just let's
[1:24:33] just go ahead because i will uh
[1:24:36] i mean peter used a word here and then
[1:24:38] it's the same word that paul used every
[1:24:40] time
[1:24:41] uh the apostle used that word
[1:24:44] as seven
[1:24:49] peter s7 and an apostle
[1:24:52] it goes back to the jubilee
[1:24:57] that word seven means a bound slave
[1:25:02] it goes back to the jubilee is is it is
[1:25:05] that it is that uh it is that seven all
[1:25:08] that slave that refused to go
[1:25:11] and have pierced his ear
[1:25:14] that's that's the one that is called a
[1:25:16] bound a bound seven so every time they
[1:25:19] use that word

[1:27:26] there is not
[1:27:27] there is not
[1:27:29] anything
[1:27:30] that faith is additional
[1:27:32] but everything is added to faith
[1:27:37] praise the lord
[1:27:38] there is not anything that fake is added
[1:27:41] to but everything is added to faith
[1:27:44] and uh and you know
[1:27:47] as as we grow in the lord
[1:27:50] and you read the word and you you're
[1:27:53] listening to the message
[1:27:55] sometimes you
[1:27:57] you just realize and and you you kind of
[1:27:59] for being earnest with yourself you say
[1:28:01] lord
[1:28:02] how how how did we miss this thing
[1:28:07] because it's the same voice
[1:28:10] you know it's the same voice of the
[1:28:12] prophet we've been listening to all of
[1:28:13] these years
[1:28:17] praise the lord
[1:28:19] how did we taught
[1:28:21] that brother branham was saying
[1:28:22] something
[1:28:27] you know uh
[1:28:29] uh unveiling of god he says uh
[1:28:32] trying to say something without saying
[1:28:34] it
[1:28:37] he says all of these years i've been
[1:28:38] trying to say something without saying
[1:28:40] it
[1:28:44] you know so
[1:28:46] so i was listening to to to that message
[1:28:49] today
[1:28:50] and i was just
[1:28:52] i was just uh
[1:28:53] you know because the way that we have uh
[1:28:57] uh presented
[1:28:58] the message the statue of the perfect
[1:29:00] man
[1:29:01] as if to say it is something uh
[1:29:05] come you know uh completely different or
[1:29:08] a complete different work
[1:29:11] than the work that grace will be doing
[1:29:13] in our life
[1:29:15] and and and because of that people make
[1:29:18] a movement over this subject
[1:29:22] you know
[1:29:23] that's the seventh vets you i mean we we
[1:29:26] got to get that seven virtue and come to
[1:29:28] the capstone you know for for for the
[1:29:31] capstone to come down on the seventh
[1:29:33] venue and and all of that but all that
[1:29:36] that peter was trying to say it in and
[1:29:39] which of course that's what brother
[1:29:40] branham said on tape
[1:29:42] all he was trying to teach us is just
[1:29:44] fruit bearing
[1:29:49] it's just fruit bearing he was just he
[1:29:52] was just using another approach but if
[1:29:54] you look at what he's talking about
[1:29:58] and i think i
[1:30:00] i copied something but bram said
[1:30:02] right at the beginning of the message
[1:30:04] let me see if i share that with you i
[1:30:06] didn't send it back there so
[1:30:08] don't look for it up
[1:30:11] praise the lord
[1:30:16] i hope
[1:30:23] when he was starting uh
[1:30:25] that message statue of a perfect man he
[1:30:27] said this morning
[1:30:29] i want to speak on the subject or teach
[1:30:33] rather if we can
[1:30:36] build
[1:30:37] a living
[1:30:39] tabernacle
[1:30:43] so he's using
[1:30:45] peter's language art
[1:30:48] to say we will build
[1:30:51] a living tabernacle
[1:30:54] praise the lord because that's what a
[1:30:56] builder does he i won't break to another
[1:31:01] sure
[1:31:04] but if you go along you will realize
[1:31:06] that brother branham says all those
[1:31:08] virtue comes through our faith
[1:31:18] now you think about it you think about
[1:31:20] the seven uh uh uh a vector that is
[1:31:24] given here by by the uh uh the apostle
[1:31:28] peter and and and you know and and and
[1:31:31] and the way we think that's what we need
[1:31:33] for us to put us in the rapture
[1:31:37] praise the lord
[1:31:40] what are we going to do with temperance
[1:31:43] and patience
[1:31:45] there when it is here we need it
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:50] it's here we need it
[1:31:57] praise the lord
[1:32:01] so your passion your knowledge in the
[1:32:03] world just reveal your faith
[1:32:06] it reveal the level of faith you have
[1:32:11] your passion you have to deal with
[1:32:14] yourself
[1:32:15] and to deal with other it just reveal
[1:32:19] your level of faith in the word
[1:32:22] because faith is the sea faith coming by
[1:32:25] hearing and hearing of the word of god
[1:32:29] that's all that's all it's just about a
[1:32:31] mature christian
[1:32:33] brethren goes along in the message and
[1:32:35] said we are building a living monument
[1:32:38] he said it's a living monument
[1:32:42] for the living god
[1:32:44] it's a living tabernacle on two feet
[1:32:48] it's all showing the maturity of the
[1:32:50] believer
[1:32:54] can people be able to draw strength from
[1:32:57] you
[1:32:59] can they draw vet you from you
[1:33:01] that's what that's why the woman with a
[1:33:04] blood issue date
[1:33:05] she drew vets you from jesus
[1:33:08] to heal her
[1:33:09] but people can draw virtue from you to
[1:33:12] strengthen them in an hour of weakness
[1:33:17] but they cannot get it if you don't have
[1:33:19] it
[1:33:20] that's right if your faith in the world
[1:33:24] is not positive
[1:33:26] to be able to encourage somebody
[1:33:28] in the worst hour of their life
[1:33:36] if you don't have enough faith
[1:33:39] to control your emotions
[1:33:43] it's your fate in the world
[1:33:45] that that brings your body under control
[1:33:53] leave this word
[1:33:54] and wash your attitude
[1:33:58] just leave the word
[1:34:01] praise the lord
[1:34:03] right leave the word i mean don't read
[1:34:05] the word don't pray
[1:34:07] don't come to church
[1:34:10] praise the lord
[1:34:14] try it
[1:34:20] praise the lord
[1:34:25] you will surprise yourself
[1:34:28] the things that you will do
[1:34:31] praise the lord
[1:34:32] you will surprise yourself
[1:34:35] or you'll be very surprised you will
[1:34:38] think that
[1:34:39] you you are living with somebody else
[1:34:47] so is it it is that
[1:34:49] it is the word in the seed form faith
[1:34:53] coming by hearing
[1:34:54] as you hear the word and embrace the
[1:34:58] word
[1:34:58] and make the world your own
[1:35:01] don't make it somebody else
[1:35:06] and the word reveal those areas in your
[1:35:10] life where he want to grow where he want
[1:35:13] to bring you up
[1:35:14] that's all brother branham was teaching
[1:35:21] that's all he was teaching
[1:35:28] because peter is teaching the very same
[1:35:31] thing that jesus taught in john 15.
[1:35:37] i'm the vine
[1:35:38] they are the branches
[1:35:44] praise the lord
[1:35:46] so peter now
[1:35:48] at that time jesus was teaching that
[1:35:51] he was not converted yet
[1:35:54] right
[1:35:55] in his mind he's sitting down in church
[1:35:58] branch
[1:36:01] van branch where is he
[1:36:04] this guy is every time he just he's
[1:36:07] preaching also some message
[1:36:09] and vine and branching
[1:36:12] bear fruit
[1:36:13] yeah i get children
[1:36:15] about born children yeah
[1:36:18] thinking about his natural children as
[1:36:20] his fruit
[1:36:21] when jesus is talking about spiritual
[1:36:22] gifts
[1:36:26] but now he has grown in the lord he can
[1:36:30] take that very same message
[1:36:32] honor inspiration
[1:36:37] he's preaching it with godly character
[1:36:40] out to your faith thank you
[1:36:43] and to your virtue knowledge
[1:36:45] and to your knowledge temperance
[1:36:49] praise the lord
[1:36:53] people
[1:36:54] that take uh
[1:36:56] uh uh
[1:36:59] all of these uh uh
[1:37:02] one verse doctrine in one verse
[1:37:04] you know and all of that i mean they've
[1:37:07] run over the place with uh seven thunder
[1:37:09] seven that's you and and they thought
[1:37:11] they were the class of the people and
[1:37:13] just got themselves into emotion
[1:37:16] praise the lord
[1:37:19] and just just deal with them out of the
[1:37:22] word
[1:37:23] don't don't talk about the word
[1:37:25] and they can be so so bitter and
[1:37:27] arrogant yeah
[1:37:32] absolutely was not for doctrine
[1:37:42] he says this morning
[1:37:43] we are going to build
[1:37:45] a living tabernacle
[1:37:48] for the living god
[1:37:53] praise the lord
[1:37:55] if you want to know the level of your
[1:37:57] faith
[1:38:01] watch
[1:38:02] your attitude
[1:38:06] that's all peter was trying to say
[1:38:09] that if these things abide in you if you
[1:38:12] have grown in these things if your faith
[1:38:14] is projecting that to you and knowledge
[1:38:17] and and i mean you are bringing uh
[1:38:20] things back to the world and all of that
[1:38:22] he said if these things abide in you you
[1:38:25] will not be what barren
[1:38:28] is the same bearing fruit
[1:38:48] praise the lord
[1:38:51] go and listen to the message
[1:38:53] like you have never listened to it
[1:38:54] before
[1:38:58] take everything that you taught that you
[1:39:00] knew from your mind
[1:39:04] and just listening listening to learn
[1:39:21] praise the lord
[1:39:23] and because
[1:39:25] the apostle peter said odd
[1:39:28] we feel like it's something we can do
[1:39:32] you know we can we can add fate
[1:39:35] you know so we we are working ourselves
[1:39:37] no
[1:39:38] but brahms is all of those virtue comes
[1:39:40] through your faith
[1:39:42] is the growth of your faith is the
[1:39:44] expression of your faith
[1:39:51] the way you deal with things show your
[1:39:53] level of faith in god
[1:39:59] the way you deal with things
[1:40:02] if you are anxious and and don't have
[1:40:05] patience to wait on god for things you
[1:40:07] just want it to happen it shows your
[1:40:09] level of faith
[1:40:19] praise the lord
[1:40:24] if you are conscious
[1:40:26] about
[1:40:27] your public appearance
[1:40:29] how you dress how you present yourself
[1:40:32] what is doing that
[1:40:34] is the word that is creating that
[1:40:36] consciousness in you
[1:40:40] because you know that you are
[1:40:42] representing a kingdom
[1:40:46] so it's the word that is creating that
[1:40:48] godliness in you
[1:40:57] you are conscious of that
[1:41:00] praise the lord
[1:41:04] you want to be decent
[1:41:06] in a way you dress in a way you go into
[1:41:09] public
[1:41:16] but i mean if you're also doing it
[1:41:18] because you want to just you just want
[1:41:20] to show up then
[1:41:21] yeah the other fate is
[1:41:24] that ought to fit me at birth
[1:41:27] because you all have to be about him and
[1:41:29] not about you
[1:41:40] that's all that prophet of god
[1:41:42] was trying to teach us he brought in the
[1:41:44] weight of the power male he went back
[1:41:47] representation
[1:41:49] you know how god expressed himself in
[1:41:51] the zodiac now he wants to express
[1:41:53] himself in his people god expressed
[1:41:56] himself in his word in the prophets
[1:41:59] but now he has a people a bride in this
[1:42:02] last day that he want to express himself
[1:42:05] that these garlic characters
[1:42:12] take take take uh take these virtues
[1:42:15] over to the the book of garlic and
[1:42:17] compare it with the fruit of the spirit
[1:42:19] they're all the same
[1:42:21] right
[1:42:24] they are all the same
[1:42:28] it's just it's just adjust the the
[1:42:31] diversities of the fireful ministry
[1:42:35] they come and take the same scripture
[1:42:37] and one person preach
[1:42:40] and paul spoke to them and call it the
[1:42:42] fruit of the spirit
[1:42:44] peter here speaking it and calling the
[1:42:46] vatican
[1:42:56] oh but how we made a big
[1:42:58] a big show that never took us anyway
[1:43:01] when we really thought we were on top of
[1:43:03] it
[1:43:04] we really thought we were on top of it
[1:43:07] praise the lord
[1:43:11] and all of those things
[1:43:15] but we thank god for grace
[1:43:20] that he said having us here
[1:43:23] and he has given us a second chance
[1:43:25] again
[1:43:26] to reveal ourselves and humble ourself
[1:43:29] and uh
[1:43:30] you know
[1:43:31] prophet gosh it is simple we don't have
[1:43:34] to make it complicated
[1:43:36] sure we don't have to make it
[1:43:38] complicated
[1:43:46] jesus says
[1:43:48] the son of man come will he find faith
[1:43:53] praise the lord
[1:43:55] he said will he find faith
[1:44:02] you know brother brahm talks about
[1:44:04] you know uh uh
[1:44:06] the fate of the son of man and
[1:44:08] you know and i mean we can get in all of
[1:44:10] that
[1:44:11] and and
[1:44:13] breathe you know bunch of cults and and
[1:44:15] blow our mind you know the prophet of
[1:44:16] god said and when we get to this place
[1:44:18] and that's that's the fate of the son of
[1:44:20] man
[1:44:21] you know but
[1:44:23] what i want to say
[1:44:26] here like i said
[1:44:28] from the beginning
[1:44:32] is to say how much
[1:44:37] pressure
[1:44:38] your faith is to you
[1:44:41] how much
[1:44:43] pressure
[1:44:45] your faith in god
[1:44:50] is to you
[1:44:54] is it just a religion
[1:44:56] is it just a concept
[1:45:02] but it's not supposed to be
[1:45:05] because the scripture says we walk by
[1:45:07] faith
[1:45:10] sons of god are led by faith
[1:45:13] it's supposed to be our life
[1:45:21] praise the lord
[1:45:23] because that's the only way we can
[1:45:25] please the father
[1:45:29] is when when he sees us beginning to
[1:45:32] appreciate
[1:45:34] what his word
[1:45:36] is doing in our lives
[1:45:41] now what we are doing with the word or
[1:45:44] what the word is doing
[1:45:50] how precious is your fate to you
[1:45:55] young people if you start if you if you
[1:45:57] start appreciating that faith
[1:46:00] you will water it with reading the word
[1:46:03] and praying every day
[1:46:05] because faith coming by hearing
[1:46:08] and hearing of the word of god
[1:46:15] you start growing learning to trust god
[1:46:20] god i trust you
[1:46:22] learning to take things to god in prayer
[1:46:31] that's how you grow in that statue
[1:46:36] because if you if you learn that way
[1:46:40] then you come to the place where you
[1:46:42] have had experience
[1:46:44] and different things that god has done
[1:46:46] in your life and then when other people
[1:46:48] are going through
[1:46:52] they can be able to draw from you
[1:46:56] they can be able to draw
[1:46:58] from your life
[1:47:01] you can be an inspiration to them
[1:47:04] then you are you are releasing virtue
[1:47:09] when you are giving counsel
[1:47:12] you're always telling them what the word
[1:47:14] says
[1:47:17] what the word says oh i'll
[1:47:19] i'll go and ask and find out what the
[1:47:21] scripture says about this
[1:47:23] then you are growing in godly knowledge
[1:47:29] praise the lord
[1:47:45] this faith is very precious
[1:47:50] it has make you who you are
[1:47:53] it has given you the grace for you to be
[1:47:55] sitting down here tonight
[1:47:59] praise the lord
[1:48:03] if i didn't have this fight i can i can
[1:48:06] guess what my life will be
[1:48:08] i can guess
[1:48:10] maybe i might not have been living
[1:48:23] musicians you can come
[1:48:28] that's just a little word of hesitation
[1:48:32] i prayed it was a blessing to you
[1:48:37] because surely it was a blessing to me
[1:48:41] when i
[1:48:43] starts to look in the in the prophet
[1:48:45] message
[1:48:46] and realized that
[1:48:49] we just we just you know i was i was up
[1:48:53] i was i was studying the other day
[1:48:55] i started i started becoming trouble in
[1:48:57] my mind and not trouble like doubt but
[1:49:00] as i started looking for where brother
[1:49:02] branham
[1:49:04] uh uh you know
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:07] uh uh
[1:49:08] where he took the expression
[1:49:10] uh super race
[1:49:14] praise the lord i'll share that with you
[1:49:16] one of these days it's right in the
[1:49:17] scripture brother man took it from right
[1:49:19] in the scripture it's it's a word that
[1:49:21] he used
[1:49:24] praise the lord but you see the thing
[1:49:26] about it there is that if we don't
[1:49:28] understand it
[1:49:30] if we don't understand
[1:49:32] what the holy spirit was saying to us
[1:49:36] then we pretty soon we start to be just
[1:49:38] like
[1:49:40] uh
[1:49:41] hitler and those people because that's
[1:49:43] what hitler was doing taught that you
[1:49:45] know uh uh the germans were were super
[1:49:48] race
[1:49:50] you know they were super race they were
[1:49:52] a special class of people and and we
[1:49:55] take the literal word and not even
[1:49:58] understanding what the prophet of god
[1:50:00] was saying
[1:50:01] and people get so proud they can't they
[1:50:04] can't associate with their relative
[1:50:06] because they say we are you know we are
[1:50:07] the super race bride you know we are
[1:50:10] this day you don't even understand what
[1:50:12] what brother branham meant
[1:50:17] another vision he prophesied about
[1:50:19] hitler and what would happen he saw all
[1:50:22] of those things you think brother
[1:50:23] brandon would just be naive to use the
[1:50:26] word super race
[1:50:29] because he wants to breed another people
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:51:04] race
[1:51:06] grace
[1:51:09] god's grace
[1:51:12] grace that is
[1:51:15] greater than all
[1:51:18] [Music]
[1:51:19] [Laughter]
[1:51:21] grace grace
[1:51:26] praise god
[1:51:28] let's stand up to our feet
[1:51:32] grace thou
[1:51:34] will power
