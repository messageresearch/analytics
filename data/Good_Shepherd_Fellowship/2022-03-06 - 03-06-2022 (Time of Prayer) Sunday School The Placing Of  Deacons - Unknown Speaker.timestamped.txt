[1:26] [Music]
[1:48] our little church here is sovereign
[1:51] it doesn't have any
[1:53] uh denomination or anything to send its
[1:56] deacons it elects its own deacons it
[1:59] elects its pastor
[2:01] it elects its trustees
[2:03] it elects
[2:04] everything that comes in and out of the
[2:06] church no one person has to say so over
[2:09] anything it's the church
[2:12] and the church or those who come and
[2:14] support the church with their presence
[2:16] with their tithe and offerings are
[2:18] always the ones that has legal
[2:20] say-so in the placing of such
[2:24] and i
[2:25] want to thank the uh
[2:27] past
[2:29] board of deacons
[2:32] uh say it from here for all the church
[2:36] if any of those brethren are here which
[2:38] was
[2:39] brother cox brother fleeman
[2:42] and brother higginbottom and brother
[2:45] diesman
[2:46] they have
[2:48] give us a good service
[2:51] give the lord in this tabernacle
[2:53] and ever so often according to the
[2:56] bylaws of the church every year
[2:59] the
[3:00] deacons are trustees automatically
[3:03] fill their time and if they want to come
[3:05] back all right if they do not want to
[3:07] come back then they can place them in
[3:10] their places as this board had resigned
[3:13] then the other night i called the
[3:15] trustee board which there is a new board
[3:18] of trustees i noticed brother luther
[3:20] mcdowell here tonight we're glad to see
[3:22] him in which was formerly on the trustee
[3:24] board
[3:25] i went down this week to find out is it
[3:28] check and to
[3:29] having a photostatic copy made which
[3:31] will be presented to the church also
[3:34] that the
[3:36] trustees of the church now is brother
[3:39] william morgan brother
[3:42] mike
[3:43] [Music]
[3:44] egan and brother banks woods and brother
[3:48] roy roberson
[3:50] and they're all of this city except
[3:52] brother robertson it lives between the
[3:53] two cities
[3:55] lord has seen fit in those men and they
[3:58] have been a honorable man and they have
[4:00] now received the duty as trustees of
[4:04] this church
[4:06] and then while this meeting was going on
[4:08] and was told by the assistant pastor
[4:10] that we collecting of a new board of
[4:13] deacons that these had served their time
[4:15] out and and resigned then
[4:18] it was
[4:19] to select some more deacons
[4:22] now
[4:22] the church the way this is done
[4:26] is the board can a
[4:28] appoint
[4:29] deacon
[4:30] man that they have associated with and
[4:33] found to be honorable and just man
[4:37] the office of a deacon is a very
[4:40] great office and a great honor to the
[4:44] lord to be a deacon in the church
[4:47] and so in the meeting the other night
[4:50] certain man was
[4:52] called out to me
[4:54] and when meeting with the pastor the
[4:56] following this last friday which was
[4:59] agreed by this man that these were
[5:01] honorable and just men one young man
[5:04] that they had found
[5:05] was
[5:06] not exactly qualified not because he
[5:09] wasn't the right type of man one that
[5:12] was suggested by one of the honorable
[5:14] men of our trustee board but as the
[5:17] pastor and i came together
[5:19] and i asked the age of the young man he
[5:21] was in his early 20s
[5:23] honorable just and a real man but find
[5:26] out that he was a single man
[5:28] the bible requires the deacon to be a
[5:30] married man
[5:32] he must be the
[5:33] husband of one wife
[5:35] and then
[5:36] another man which was a very honorable
[5:39] man
[5:40] very qualified for the job
[5:43] and would made a loyal man
[5:45] as a brother suggested him than after
[5:48] investigating the case that the brother
[5:51] had just recently come into this faith
[5:54] his wife doesn't believe in it then that
[5:56] disqualified the man is the office
[5:59] because he must have all his family in
[6:02] subjection they must be also in the
[6:05] faith because it would be a conflict and
[6:08] we're building now and we wish to place
[6:11] this church and as the general overseer
[6:13] of the church i must see that it's kept
[6:15] scripturally everything right on the
[6:18] word
[6:19] and so therefore
[6:20] then it has been found favorable with
[6:23] the board and the
[6:25] pastor and the overseer to select in
[6:28] this group of people here some man who
[6:31] we think to be honorable and just man we
[6:35] can only bring them and it's then they
[6:37] are appointed
[6:38] by the church by their own
[6:42] vote
[6:43] and then these men shall serve if they
[6:46] feel that they will accept this office
[6:49] then they will come for a short time to
[6:52] see if they feel that maybe that god has
[6:56] called them it is later if they feel
[6:58] that they are disqualified and they have
[7:01] a right in the next few weeks to resign
[7:03] the office that someone else could be
[7:05] appointed in their place
[7:08] however
[7:09] at the beginning of the revival if if
[7:12] god willing i want to hold here in this
[7:14] tabernacle as soon as i get some rest
[7:17] then i
[7:18] then i we will
[7:20] ordain these deacons by laying on hands
[7:24] deacons and treasure
[7:27] in this church but first they must be
[7:29] appointed and and see how they like it
[7:32] and how the congregation likes it
[7:33] benefits of then if it's all right on
[7:36] both sides then we make these men
[7:39] ordained deacons just like trustees are
[7:42] elected the same way it's the
[7:44] sovereignty and the law of the church by
[7:47] the word of god
[7:48] therefore that it just can't say that i
[7:51] think this man would be a right man that
[7:53] isn't it brother neville thinks this man
[7:55] be a right man or the trustee board
[7:57] think this man to be a right man it has
[7:59] to be by the
[8:01] church
[8:02] no one does anything within himself here
[8:05] it's the boat of the church it's a
[8:07] sovereign church
[8:10] the old set of bylaws was destroyed in
[8:12] the 1937 flood
[8:15] we have recopied those and will be hung
[8:17] on the wall here soon the duties of
[8:20] trustees deacons treasures and so forth
[8:23] pastors associates and so forth
[8:26] by the grace of god
[8:30] it has been said to me and a
[8:33] 100 percent vote to the board of this
[8:36] church that they have found
[8:38] that brother holland hickerson
[8:41] to be a just honorable man
[8:43] and in line in this position to receive
[8:46] the
[8:47] the
[8:48] great honor of being deacon of this said
[8:51] tabernacle
[8:53] also we have found and by the vote of
[8:56] the board
[8:57] that
[8:59] brother
[9:00] collins
[9:03] also has been found an honorable and
[9:05] just man
[9:07] being a minister himself therefore we
[9:09] would ask him to come
[9:11] and to be
[9:13] a deacon of the church and not only a
[9:16] deacon but an associate to brother
[9:18] neville
[9:20] and perhaps to a sunday school class or
[9:22] to take the place of brother neville or
[9:25] whatever has been called on here to be
[9:27] an associate to brother neville
[9:30] that's brother
[9:32] collins
[9:34] and also the church has found
[9:37] in favor
[9:39] that
[9:40] brother tony zabal
[9:42] an honorable and just man
[9:45] and he's been favored before the trustee
[9:47] board and
[9:48] the pastors to
[9:51] ask him to receive the office of deacon
[9:54] and this said
[9:56] tabernacle
[9:58] and it's also been asked and found an
[10:01] honorable man among us not he's not
[10:03] being the only honorable man now but
[10:05] just has been selected by the board
[10:09] of brother um
[10:11] taylor
[10:13] from henryville
[10:15] or memphis i believe it is memphis
[10:17] indiana who's been with us for some time
[10:19] acting as usher and whatever could be
[10:21] that the church has found favor with him
[10:24] are the board and pastors that he would
[10:26] accept the
[10:28] the
[10:29] great office as being the
[10:31] deacon
[10:32] of this said tabernacle
[10:35] and it's also been
[10:38] asked that
[10:39] brother mike egan's son-in-law brother
[10:43] [Music]
[10:44] brother bob harmon
[10:46] has been selected by the board and by
[10:49] the pastors to accept the office as
[10:52] treasurer
[10:53] of this said tabernacle
[10:56] which is an honorable job
[10:58] and it requires justice and honor
[11:01] and doing this i thank my brother
[11:04] that calling you from here
[11:06] that that it would be a great
[11:09] honor to you and not only that but
[11:12] something to do at this time i will have
[11:15] brother neville or associate to read the
[11:18] requirements of the deacon
[11:21] brother neville if you'll read it from
[11:22] the word of god
[11:24] first timothy
[11:26] 3
[11:27] eight through
[11:27] [Music]
[11:29] of this
[11:30] eight through twelve
[11:33] likewise must the deacons be grave
[11:37] not double tongue
[11:39] not given to much wine and greedy of
[11:41] filthy luker
[11:42] holding the mystery of the faith and a
[11:44] pure conscience
[11:46] and let these also first be proved
[11:50] then let them use the office of a deacon
[11:53] being found blameless
[11:55] even so must their wives be grave
[11:58] not slander sober faithful in all things
[12:02] let the deacons be the husbands of one
[12:04] wife
[12:05] ruling their children and their own
[12:07] houses well
[12:08] for they that have used the office of a
[12:11] deacon
[12:12] well purchased to themselves a good
[12:14] degree
[12:15] and great boldness in the faith
[12:18] which is in christ jesus

[21:12] there's one thing they do know they know
[21:15] the hour they were born again
[21:18] i'm so glad for them
[21:21] and as a little
[21:23] parable that i learned and i'm going to
[21:25] associate it tonight with my two little
[21:27] girls
[21:29] to kind of make it come home to us
[21:32] to make it real to us
[21:37] that you would understand the meaning of
[21:40] it
[21:42] one morning raising up out of bed i've
[21:45] got two little girls
[21:47] one of them is rebecca
[21:49] and one of them is sarah
[21:52] and they're daddy's little girls
[21:55] i've got a little boy joseph
[21:59] i was coming from chattanooga out of a
[22:01] meeting one night
[22:03] [Music]
[22:04] while i was there in this last campaign
[22:07] and i was in
[22:10] the
[22:11] car going along with my older son billy
[22:15] his wife and me was in the
[22:18] car
[22:19] and the girls
[22:21] as we were rolling along
[22:24] nobody had said nothing for several city
[22:26] blocks
[22:27] and i'd cut pretty hard on the people
[22:29] that night about the way they were doing
[22:33] nobody had said anything and little
[22:35] joseph come over and grab me by the
[22:37] shoulder
[22:38] he said daddy
[22:40] you sure didn't preach tonight
[22:47] and this morning
[22:48] as i was leaving and going up to 8th and
[22:52] 10th street
[22:54] the
[22:55] our pen intense brother
[22:57] nobody had said a thing the wife and the
[23:00] two girls
[23:02] a little joseph tucked a hold of my
[23:03] shoulder again
[23:05] he said
[23:06] hey i sure liked that preaching this
[23:10] morning he said
[23:12] i said well i've got one fan that's my
[23:14] son
[23:18] into our little
[23:20] scene
[23:22] up one morning sitting in the room
[23:26] little becky come running out and say
[23:29] she straddled my leg and put her arm
[23:31] around me and
[23:33] she's daddy's little girl
[23:36] and she was hugging me and
[23:39] little sarah jumped out of bed with her
[23:42] little pajamas and would say come
[23:44] running next she's a little brown-eyed
[23:46] one
[23:47] little becky would say
[23:49] oh sarah
[23:51] there's no need of you coming
[23:54] because i've got all of daddy myself
[23:58] that is all
[24:00] mine
[24:02] and little sarah her little lips dropped
[24:05] down their little brown eyes colored up
[24:08] emotion like this and stuck out the
[24:10] other knee
[24:11] and she come and straddled it
[24:14] becky's got longer legs so they would
[24:16] reach the floor
[24:17] little cell was starting so i put both
[24:19] arms around sarah
[24:21] little several of sword becky and said
[24:25] becky
[24:28] you may have all of daddy
[24:30] but daddy's got all of me
[24:35] and i think that's so it is sure we
[24:37] might not know all of the theology and
[24:40] all the great greek words this group of
[24:42] people might not know but there's one
[24:44] thing sure i believe jesus has got all
