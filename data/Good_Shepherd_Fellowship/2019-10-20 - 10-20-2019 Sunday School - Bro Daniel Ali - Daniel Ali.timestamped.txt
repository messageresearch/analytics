[0:47] minutes father

[0:52] children and for the adults we commit
[0:55] both Sunday schools into your hands this
[0:57] morning Oh God
[0:58] may you open our eyes to see to see
[1:01] something new something that will lift
[1:03] us up further old God and draw us closer
[1:06] unto thee that our walk with you would
[1:09] never be the same open our ears to hear
[1:13] open our hearts father to receive a few
[1:16] this morning bless our host Lord bless
[1:21] something new happen to our life father
[1:25] let something exciting happen to our
[1:28] life
[1:29] do not let our last father or God be
[1:32] boring
[1:33] bless us Lord we pray and we beseech
[1:36] thee father this morning in Jesus name
[1:39] Amen
[1:42] god bless you saints happy to see once
[1:46] again yeah I spoke with brother one last
[1:50] night around around 11 o'clock last
[1:54] night he sends his greetings he said say
[1:59] hi to the family and I believe he was
[2:02] talking about the family of God there is
[2:06] no family that can be compared to this
[2:08] family of ours
[2:11] you know you think of our natural
[2:13] families what makes us a family is
[2:17] because you have the blood of your
[2:20] father mother running through your veins
[2:22] and another person share the same DNA so
[2:26] so this is my brother this is my sister
[2:29] that is in the natural and I come to
[2:33] think of it in the spiritual to have the
[2:38] blood of the Lord Jesus running through
[2:40] our veins and making us we never knew
[2:43] ourselves brothers and sisters I mean
[2:46] it's such a wonderful feeling nothing
[2:50] compares to it and nothing can compare
[2:52] to it you know as a as brother brother
[2:57] I've said that the importance of
[2:59] Revelation can never be overemphasized
[3:02] and jesus told his disciples
[3:05] upon this rock I build my church and the
[3:08] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[3:10] it you know it just sometimes we lose
[3:15] facto certain things we don't grab the
[3:20] spiritual importance of it and we let
[3:24] the revelation of Ages slide under the
[3:27] carpet but I pray God you know to grant
[3:31] us grace to see things much more
[3:35] differently that this family is a
[3:38] superior family that our natural
[3:42] families do not come anywhere close this
[3:45] family that is where we can have so much
[3:48] confidence in one another that things
[3:51] will not even do for our natural
[3:53] brothers and sisters we can do it we can
[3:56] show it among ourselves freely why
[3:59] because the blood of our Redemption
[4:02] my goodness nothing compares the blood
[4:08] that runs through our veins as natural
[4:11] brothers and sisters is wife
[4:16] is is in no way form or shape compared
[4:21] to the blood by which we are redeemed
[4:25] the blood that has United us together
[4:28] praise be to God God bless you all and
[4:33] he says good morning to everyone of you
[4:37] it was a very difficult week for some of
[4:40] us waking 12 hours
[4:44] I'm always up at 2 a.m. I don't come
[4:47] home until somewhere around 3:00 3:30
[4:51] p.m. and 6 days a week actually as I'm
[4:58] here my colleagues are still working
[5:00] praise be to God
[5:02] they know that my Sunday's are special
[5:06] to me
[5:06] and that I don't work on Sundays that
[5:09] alone is enough for me praise be to God
[5:12] I didn't have to look for somebody to
[5:15] backfill they had to do it and where are
[5:20] the girls I want to do it or not house
[5:21] that was my back case yeah but tangled
[5:24] that message has been made very very
[5:27] clear and they understand it praise be
[5:32] to God I'm happy to be here this morning
[5:35] I forgive me if I engage you in a rat
[5:38] race but I just don't know what is going
[5:42] to happen we are trusting God as
[5:44] something would happen because for every
[5:46] time we gather before him something
[5:49] special happens praise be to God last
[5:52] week we looked at intercessory prayer a
[5:58] lot about intercessory prayer now we're
[6:03] ready for phase 2 multi 2 1 & 2 1 2 3 I
[6:09] don't know if you okay we can first
[6:13] emoti 2 1 first emoji
[6:25] now I exact therefore that first of all
[6:30] supplications prayers intercessions and
[6:34] giving of thanks be made for all men
[6:37] praise be to God
[6:39] so we talked at length about
[6:41] intercessory prayer and a part of it has
[6:48] to do with standing in the gap for
[6:50] somebody when I cast my mind back to
[6:55] when Moses came from the mountain with
[6:58] the two tablets containing the Ten
[7:00] Commandments and he saw the people
[7:03] worshiping the golden calf and he hit
[7:05] them on the ground and brought them and
[7:07] he still did not catch them he did not
[7:11] catch them even though he was so
[7:13] disappointed and God was so displeased
[7:15] with what went on Moses still stood in
[7:20] the gap when you read the scriptures the
[7:23] Bible says he prayed for them God was so
[7:27] displaced and not only the people God
[7:30] was so displeased with Aaron and would
[7:33] have destroyed him but Moses prayed for
[7:36] error and God made him God was so
[7:43] displeased with what happened and was so
[7:46] displeased with error but God had Moses
[7:51] intercession when you look at how the
[7:57] wrath of God came down upon nature upon
[8:00] how the churn of God tempted God and the
[8:04] wrath of God came down and God wanted to
[8:08] destroy them Moses threw himself in the
[8:12] gap and said no don't do it
[8:15] if you do it our enemies are going to
[8:17] laugh at us they were saying you
[8:20] delivered us where you couldn't get us
[8:22] to the promised land so you have
[8:25] destroyed us don't do it Moses stood in
[8:27] the gap and God respected that and what
[8:33] I have come to realize
[8:36] does sometimes stunning in the gap
[8:41] intercessory prayer what happens is that
[8:45] God is not looking at the person God is
[8:52] looking at you who is standing in the
[8:54] gap praise be to God
[8:59] the fellows healing their fellows
[9:02] deliverance depends on your fate the
[9:07] father doesn't even come into question
[9:10] God was not looking at what a child of
[9:12] Israel did even though he was displeased
[9:13] with it but here was Moses standing in
[9:17] the gap God was looking at Moses God
[9:21] spared him and it comes to that moment
[9:26] that when you are standing in the gap of
[9:29] somebody it's your faith God is looking
[9:33] at it's your faith that is going to put
[9:36] up a central it's your faith that is
[9:38] going to grind up s India healing it's
[9:40] your faith that is going to bring them
[9:42] that deliverance praise be to God we
[9:47] read about the the Centurion last week
[9:53] and I'm Darius from Luke 7 1 to 10 and
[10:00] we said as Saint children had a servant
[10:03] who was so dear to him who was sick to
[10:06] the point of death it was not the
[10:11] servants faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:14] that healed him no it was the Centurion
[10:20] when he said his service to tell a lot
[10:23] Jesus that I am not worried I should
[10:26] come under my roof need account I ready
[10:29] to come to you but just pick mi7 to be
[10:33] made whole praise be to God and Allah
[10:36] jesus said I've not seen this type of it
[10:38] not in Israel and that very moment his
[10:44] servant was made hold we also talked
[10:47] about a self-sufficient woman the brick
[10:49] woman
[10:49] whose daughter was sick and she wanted a
[10:53] lot Jesus and a lot told him it is not
[10:56] me to give that us bread two dogs that
[10:59] did not turn her away she said
[11:01] nevertheless that dogs it from the
[11:05] crumbs that fall from the table
[11:07] that moved him praise be to God it was
[11:11] have faith in the Lord Jesus that healed
[11:13] Hedorah standing in the gap there are
[11:20] things we are all praying for there are
[11:22] people that are so dear to us
[11:24] maybe brothers who are no more in our
[11:28] midst
[11:28] sisters who are no more in our mist
[11:31] maybe our children maybe our parents
[11:33] maybe our husbands our wives whatever
[11:37] there are people that we are holding
[11:39] before God praise be to God
[11:43] do not let your faith a waiver don't
[11:49] look at what they are doing for God is
[11:52] counting on your faith to bring them in
[11:56] praise be to God when I was looking at
[12:01] this around 140
[12:03] this morning a lot of things came to my
[12:06] matter how to just get up and write them
[12:08] down before I forget but it looks very
[12:11] much like are we putting that in
[12:13] somewhere next week God willing there is
[12:17] something I want to get to today and I'm
[12:19] trusting God with the limited time we
[12:21] have that God is going to help us and to
[12:24] see us through praise beauty God
[12:26] now whatever you set your mind on to do
[12:34] for God do not let anything distract you
[12:39] even in the natural if you find somebody
[12:43] today I want to be this tomorrow
[12:46] he lives that I want to be this one and
[12:48] then he lives this I want to be this
[12:50] else they'll go through life without
[12:52] achieving anything but when somebody
[12:57] decided this is what I want to do
[13:00] regardless of the obstacles they may
[13:03] fall here and right there and if they
[13:06] never give up and they continue to
[13:07] persist the end of achieving it
[13:11] whatever requests you have before God
[13:15] don't abandon it I don't care what
[13:20] request you have before God what I want
[13:22] to pray for keep trusting God hold on
[13:31] never throw in the towel tightness is
[13:36] not our portion there is a saying that
[13:40] if someone is chasing something is
[13:43] running after you and that tin is not
[13:46] tired you that is running away should
[13:50] never complain of tightness praise be to
[13:55] God James for three
[14:01] James for three
[14:04] I already have it here don't need to
[14:06] open my Bible you ask and receive not
[14:09] because you ask amiss that you may
[14:15] consume it upon your lusts and there are
[14:20] two things I want us to look at you ask
[14:25] amiss what does it mean to ask amiss I
[14:28] try to find out from the additional and
[14:31] it means that we don't ask quite right
[14:35] and then our requests are sometimes
[14:41] inappropriate and then out of place just
[14:50] imagine I I don't have any science
[15:02] background and then when I go to bed
[15:06] when I go on my knees to pray I tell God
[15:09] I want to go go on a space walk
[15:13] I want to go in a space mission I first
[15:17] said I pray telling God I want to go on
[15:19] a space mission I want to walk on the
[15:21] moon just think about it
[15:24] it's very inappropriate it's out of
[15:30] place I'm askin amis our God is a
[15:40] miracle worker we believe in miracles
[15:44] our God is not a magician so sometimes
[15:50] the things we ask outrageous they are
[15:53] simply out of place so we ask amiss that
[15:59] we may consume it upon our lusts
[16:06] so here motive comes in motive comes in
[16:18] you may ask right back with a wrong
[16:22] motive it's 110 ask a right with a good
[16:30] motive let's say there is nothing wrong
[16:36] with asking for wisdom because the Bible
[16:38] says ask for wisdom in a book of
[16:43] prophets for seven the Bible says wisdom
[16:47] is the principal thing therefore seek it
[16:54] wisdom now if I go to God asking for
[17:00] wisdom I am asking for something good
[17:06] talking of the wisdom of men because the
[17:10] book of first Corinthians says that I
[17:13] come to you not with the enticing words
[17:15] of man's wisdom I am NOT talking of the
[17:19] wisdom of men that can grow wings that
[17:23] can get so pompous that can get so proud
[17:25] no that's not what I'm talking about I'm
[17:28] talking about the wisdom of God that
[17:31] wisdom of God brings humility it humbles
[17:35] you praise be to God
[17:37] now so there is nothing wrong with
[17:40] asking for wisdom but if I am asking for
[17:43] wisdom because I I want to prove to
[17:47] everybody that I am the wisest I'll
[17:50] prove to a better a sister know that I'm
[17:52] better than you or I understands it
[17:55] better than you I am even - I'm asking
[17:57] for something good it's on a wrong
[18:01] premises the motive behind my requests
[18:06] is wrong but when you ask right and your
[18:16] motive is right God is bound to answer
[18:20] the prayer praise be to God you say oh
[18:23] brother I have been praying praying
[18:25] praying asking this it's right my motive
[18:28] is right yet I have not seen any result
[18:31] keep holding on keep holding on if the
[18:36] motive is right keep holding on if what
[18:39] you're asking is right keep holding on
[18:43] this calls for patients with God most of
[18:48] the times that is what we lack we've
[18:51] already talked about these things even
[18:52] though we are where we are a revision
[18:54] week we are not going to go back to it
[18:56] now can I just touch it here and there
[18:58] as we go patients in your walk with God
[19:03] is very important never lose sight of
[19:06] that keep holding on and never give a
[19:08] praise be to God
[19:18] and now sometimes our Prius earns it but
[19:28] we don't get to realize that our prayers
[19:31] are answered because we go to God and we
[19:37] pray and in the back of our minds we
[19:40] expect God to come in a special way of
[19:43] course we don't map a strategy for God
[19:48] God can choose any way he wants to do
[19:51] his thing but sometimes we decide for
[19:55] God how God should come and how God's
[19:58] you answer our prayer the time he should
[20:00] come in he should come at 12:00 midday
[20:02] he should come wearing a long rope and
[20:04] then he should come speak him like
[20:07] somebody I mean we cannot do all that
[20:09] and then we miss it when God comes and
[20:12] when God answers our prayer there was a
[20:14] sister who went to prayer and I he spoke
[20:19] to God he said I have lived for you all
[20:22] my life I have cept you I have been
[20:27] faithful the best way I know I have had
[20:32] a lot about you but I have never set
[20:35] eyes on you I want to see you dear Lord
[20:38] Jesus I am going to prepare your food
[20:43] and I want you to come and eat that food
[20:46] and as she went to the market and then
[20:51] she went and shopped but her ingredients
[20:52] bought food and whatnot she came and she
[20:54] prepared the food and when it was ready
[20:58] she said the table and as she prayed say
[21:01] Lord Jesus your food is ready
[21:03] I'm waiting for you to come and eat this
[21:05] food and then she was sitting down just
[21:10] waiting waiting waiting
[21:12] then somebody knocks at the door then
[21:14] she jumps off rest to the door opens the
[21:18] door and I was this little man old man
[21:22] standing in front of the door
[21:25] with his hair so bushy what is beard
[21:30] hanging not very well-dressed and then
[21:38] he greeted her hello yes
[21:44] what do you want she couldn't even
[21:46] respond to the greetings yes what do you
[21:49] want
[21:50] it's a please can I get some water to
[21:52] drink and then she looked at him for a
[21:55] while wondering do I have a cup in this
[21:58] house for somebody like this and then
[22:01] she went up in the cabinet oh the
[22:04] glasses that way they she didn't find
[22:06] any cup for that man then she remembered
[22:09] she had a rubber cup a drinking cup
[22:12] plastic one some way and then she went
[22:15] and took it she could not even get him
[22:18] water from the fridge the refrigerator
[22:21] she wanted a pump open the faucet just
[22:25] filled a cup and brought it to this man
[22:27] and a man took it drank it I said thank
[22:31] you and as she took the cup when the man
[22:36] left she threw it in the trash the man
[22:41] left she was there waiting waiting
[22:44] waiting nothing happened she went to bed
[22:48] and then she prayed daeul oh jesus you
[22:52] disappointed me I prayed I prepared your
[22:57] food I asked you to come and eat and you
[22:59] never showed up there right in the dream
[23:02] I mean she went to she went to bed and
[23:05] she had a dream and in the dream the
[23:08] Lord said I came but you never accepted
[23:13] me you called me you invited me to come
[23:18] and eat I came and you turn me away
[23:24] that is how it
[23:27] there are some times we pray and we ask
[23:32] for teens God does them God answers our
[23:35] prayer but we have a picture in our
[23:39] minds of how we want things to be that
[23:43] even though God has answered our prayer
[23:45] and a prayer is screaming so loud the
[23:49] other screaming so loud I am here your
[23:52] place and said yes we paid left years to
[23:55] it why because in our minds we have
[24:01] something we have it already designed
[24:04] the way it should be it ought not to be
[24:09] so a child of God you should know when
[24:14] be sensitive to the leadership of the
[24:16] Holy Spirit know when God is in control
[24:20] and if you cannot test that God is in
[24:24] control let go of the steering wheel
[24:28] because you know praise be to God
[24:31] wonderful that nothing can go wrong
[24:39] so a lot of the ways God answers our
[24:42] prayer and yet we don't see it in a
[24:45] message believe in God their prophet
[24:49] said is and I want to read it and I
[24:51] notice that some of us have more faith
[24:55] than others and those who have abundance
[24:57] of faith are supposed to pray for those
[25:02] so if you have faith this is again
[25:06] bringing us back to intercessory prayer
[25:09] is bringing us back to standing in the
[25:12] gap for one another is so so so
[25:15] important never overlook it never look
[25:19] down on it if you can stand in the gap
[25:24] for a brother for a sister forever
[25:28] depend if you can just turn and your
[25:31] faith does not waver God is going to
[25:33] honor your faith and things will begin
[25:36] to happen in the life of that person
[25:38] praise be to God but you don't leave but
[25:44] if you don't live right if you don't
[25:49] leave the right kind of life you better
[25:52] live away from it the devil would laugh
[25:55] at your prayer but when you live right
[25:58] and do right and act right and have
[26:00] faith in God Satan will tremble when you
[26:03] speak because God swore on the
[26:07] obligation he would take care of that
[26:10] prayer and that is true praise be to God
[26:13] so the life you live also matters there
[26:19] is power in the life you live their life
[26:24] you live we have said that time and
[26:26] again and we can never overemphasize
[26:28] that that you don't profess 1:10 and
[26:33] your life it's something else
[26:37] live in the word pray in the word work
[26:42] in the word whatever you want to do make
[26:45] sure you are standing in the world
[26:47] praise be to God so the life you are
[26:50] living also matters the Prophet said
[26:52] else the devil will laugh at your prayer
[26:54] but if the life is right when you go on
[26:57] your knees to pray the devil trembles
[26:59] praise be to God
[27:01] now in this message be led by the spirit
[27:08] now what did I tell you last night this
[27:14] was in Germany the prophet of God prayed
[27:17] for a lady with greater when the life is
[27:23] gone out it has to shrink now sister
[27:27] there'll be like that for three days and
[27:29] three nights it may get worse then don't
[27:34] worry that's a sign you are healed just
[27:37] keep giving praise to God when I come
[27:42] back to Germany come and testify praise
[27:46] be to God
[27:50] in the message what shall I do with
[27:54] Jesus call Christ I'm just a few minutes
[27:57] away
[27:57] let me chip this in well this was making
[28:01] the little woman get worse many times I
[28:05] explained it if you get worse does the
[28:09] very sign that you are healed praise be
[28:12] to God I may not be able to read all
[28:17] this I may reserve a part of it for next
[28:20] week
[28:21] my time is almost up you know sometimes
[28:27] and I remember last you remember the one
[28:31] was preaching he said for you to get
[28:34] beautiful it has to get ugly
[28:37] praise be to God so there is beauty in
[28:42] ugliness maybe your pain level is one
[28:49] and then after you are being prayed for
[28:51] it elevates from one all the way to nine
[28:54] so what it was very driven prayer for me
