[23:05] Sunday being the first Sunday normally
[23:11] we will have had communion in the

[23:23] it's good when you have people in church
[23:26] that are you know desiring to to just be
[23:31] part of all of those different
[23:32] ordinances amen and you know the people
[23:38] who will keep texting and keep asking
[23:40] you know different questions in one of
[23:42] you so I kept thinking about it
[23:47] realizing that we will always have this
[23:49] kind of rhythm sorry for keeping you
[23:51] standing let's read the scripture
[23:54] reading if I don't forget I will
[23:56] continue what I'm saying praise the Lord
[23:59] amen
[24:00] love the law tonight I assure you do
[24:04] Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter 6

[24:47] chapter 9 sorry
[24:50] Matthew chapter 9
[25:04] Marcin chapter now let's read together
[25:12] and he entered into a ship and passed
[25:14] over and came into his own country and
[25:18] behold they brought to him a man sick of
[25:23] the palsy lying on the bed and Jesus
[25:28] seen the effect said unto the sick of
[25:33] the palsy son be of good cheer that sin
[25:39] be forgiven thee and behold setting all
[25:43] the strife said within himself
[25:45] this man blaspheme and Jesus more in
[25:49] their thoughts said Wuerffel think ye
[25:54] evil in your heart praise the Lord my
[25:58] goodness you have to be careful when you
[26:00] around him he men he knows your thought
[26:03] my goodness praise the Lord Amen
[26:08] wherefore you thing evil in your in your
[26:11] heart for whether is easy to say that
[26:16] sin be forgiven thee or to say arise and
[26:20] walk but that ye may know that the Son
[26:24] of man hath power on earth to forgive
[26:26] sins then said he told the sick of the
[26:32] palsy arise take up that bed and go on
[26:37] to the house and he arose and depart to
[26:41] his house and when the mortage you saw
[26:44] it the mother and glorified God which
[26:48] had given such power unto men praise the
[26:52] Lord
[26:53] realizing that is net unto Jesus alone
[26:56] this power is given unto us that we can
[26:58] experience in our myths and Jesus passed
[27:02] forth from thence he saw a man named
[27:06] Matthew sitting at the receive of custom
[27:11] and he said unto Him follow me and he
[27:13] arose and follow him and it came to pass
[27:16] as Jesus sat at meat in the in the house
[27:21] behold many publicans and sinners came
[27:24] and sat down
[27:26] with him in his disciples and when the
[27:30] Pharisee saw it they said unto his
[27:33] disciple why eat at your masters with
[27:37] publicans and sinners but when Jesus
[27:41] heard that he said unto them they that
[27:46] be whole need not a physician but they
[27:51] that are sick but go ye and learn what
[27:57] die minute what that meaneth we have
[28:02] mercy and not sacrifice for I am come to
[28:06] call I'm not come to call the righteous
[28:09] but sinners to repentance amen
[28:14] let's pray together tonight Heavenly
[28:16] Father law we approach the service
[28:18] tonight Oh God with Thanksgiving in our
[28:21] hearts O Father Lord to know that you
[28:24] know our hearts tonight
[28:25] you know the thoughts of God upon our
[28:27] hearts Lord you know the desires so far
[28:30] the law that we bring into your house
[28:32] tonight you know the needs of God father
[28:36] you know the burden so Lord upon our
[28:38] hostel now you know our hearts you know
[28:40] how the blood flow so God all far the
[28:44] true our vain and how our heart pumps
[28:47] you know how fast a bit slow has slowed
[28:49] a bit so God you know our hearts tonight
[28:53] Almighty God Father
[28:55] precious Lord Jesus we pour our has
[28:57] before you or my regarding acts the Lord
[29:00] you will come Oh God even Lord as we
[29:02] approach your word tonight we just want
[29:05] to access special blessing of father
[29:06] upon the service tonight Oh God in the
[29:09] name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen
[29:12] the Lord bless you you may have your
[29:15] seat so just like I was saying and
[29:18] normally the the Sunday who have been
[29:24] our communion service saw my phone later
[29:27] and just now me same in the text and I
[29:31] felt bad I was not able to talk to her
[29:33] so I went home and I was just thinking
[29:34] you know as as an assembly we
[29:38] have traveled a little bit and I
[29:40] remember a couple of years back we will
[29:45] we would normally have our communion
[29:47] service on Saturday night we would come
[29:51] Saturday night in and have our communion
[29:53] service and then Sunday morning we will
[29:55] come back again and it was either the
[29:58] communion service or a prayer meeting
[30:00] you know and and that's we as we started
[30:04] traveling the lawn and and then sooner
[30:06] we went into having our communion
[30:09] service every first Sunday and and
[30:15] gradually we are growing into debt but
[30:19] just like I said on Sunday because of
[30:21] the weather
[30:22] you know I won't I won't want us coming
[30:25] you know and then being caught in the
[30:29] weddin praise the Lord
[30:31] so we we did cancer it and then I went
[30:34] home I was thinking about it and then I
[30:36] remember that I don't know whether it
[30:40] was the last communion service we had
[30:41] but I kind of make mention about it that
[30:45] we might have our community service on
[30:48] Wednesday night if the Lord lead us to
[30:50] so I had it upon my heart and quickly I
[30:53] spoke with the Deacons and and I think
[30:56] they were okay with faith instead of
[30:58] just skipping the communion service for
[31:01] the month we can come on Wednesday night
[31:03] have a prayer meeting and then just
[31:07] because it's all part of the word amen
[31:09] and we can just commute that way and
[31:13] just just as much as preaching and
[31:17] listening into the world praise the Lord
[31:20] so tonight I want to preach a little bit
[31:23] I want to take this thought that Jesus
[31:25] said right here that we have just rare
[31:28] day that behold ninet a physician amen
[31:34] data behold don't need a physician it's
[31:38] only the sake that need a physician
[31:40] praise the Lord amen and as I was
[31:45] looking at there through the scripture I
[31:47] remember Jeremiah cry to Israel
[31:52] they're not a bomb in Gila is they're
[31:54] not a physician praise the Lord
[31:57] and he says why our people you know L
[32:01] one of my people sake we have a bomb in
[32:04] Gila
[32:04] amen we have a physician and that is the
[32:07] great physician praise Lord but we live
[32:10] in in and in an Asian and loud issue has
[32:16] been diagnosed as an age that is sick
[32:19] but don't know that he has said praise
[32:21] the Lord and and and you know and
[32:25] naturally God has also blessed this age
[32:28] you know with with with great with great
[32:31] gifts of doctors you know wish of course
[32:36] when you look at the promise of divine
[32:39] healing if the law will just give us a
[32:43] little time let's go to Malachi chapter
[32:44] 4
[32:46] let's go to Malachi chapter 4
[32:59] what's now part of my trench tonight but
[33:02] it just came to my mind praise the Lord
[33:08] amen Malachi chapter 4 as we live as we
[33:16] read the promise of Malachi chapter 4 we
[33:19] we know us as believers of the message
[33:22] we return to to remember Malachi chapter
[33:26] 4 verse 5 behold I send you Elijah the
[33:29] Prophet before the coming of the Great
[33:31] and dreadful dead of the Lord but when
[33:33] you read continuously I mean when you
[33:36] read down you are from from from the 4th
[33:40] chapter we have to remember that you
[33:43] know is Bible scholars that break out of
[33:45] these all of these things into chapter
[33:47] to be able to help you know condition
[33:50] our mind to understand what is happening
[33:52] but yet a strip shows a sub verse 1
[33:54] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[33:57] an oven and all the proud yea and all
[34:00] that do wickedly shall shall be stubble
[34:03] and the day that Comet shall burn them
[34:06] said the Lord of Hosts
[34:09] amen and it
[34:13] dare I shall leave them need a root of
[34:16] branches praise the Lord and you can
[34:20] look riding the earth you know I can I
[34:23] can be able to bring global warming from
[34:24] in their scripture tonight but I'm not
[34:27] going to do it him in praise the Lord
[34:31] but it's the dead of the Lord and the
[34:33] dead of the Lord speaks of a day of
[34:35] judgment amen
[34:37] but what I want to dwell on tonight
[34:40] verse 2 but unto you that fear my name
[34:43] unto you that fear my name other people
[34:47] in the house that fear the name of the
[34:49] law tonight unto you that fear my name
[34:51] the Sun of righteousness arise with
[34:55] healing in his wings now brother Branham
[34:59] is somewhere in days brother Branham
[35:01] read that and he said the Sun of
[35:03] righteousness will rise with great
[35:05] healing campaign amen
[35:09] rise with healing in his wings and shall
[35:13] go forth amen
[35:16] he shot and and ye shall go forth and
[35:21] grow up as a cap of the star now there
[35:25] are other things I could bring you but
[35:26] what I want to look at tonight is as we
[35:30] are looking at Jesus said is those that
[35:33] I hold they don't need a physician only
[35:35] those that are safe so we realize here
[35:37] there is a promise
[35:38] over in Malachi that comes with the
[35:40] Malachi 4 promise and with the Malacca
[35:44] four promise and a Malachi 4 ministry
[35:47] and that they will they will also have
[35:50] healing part of it amen the Sun of
[35:53] righteousness that will rise up in this
[35:56] endtime ministry with healing in his
[36:00] wings praise the Lord
[36:02] amen so we see here that God gave this
[36:10] promise and when you look in the
[36:12] scripture most especially that means let
[36:16] me just kind of wrap it up quickly and
[36:18] help you you look in the book of
[36:20] Revelation as we were study together we
[36:23] realize there were four anointing there
[36:27] that was given to the church amen
[36:29] where Branham says right from the Book
[36:32] of Ezekiel when Ezekiel saw it he
[36:35] classified as the cherubim surround the
[36:37] throne but when it comes to the time of
[36:40] John
[36:41] they were like beasts they were like
[36:43] powers and and and those were the
[36:47] anointing that were around the throne
[36:48] and wish of course it has been described
[36:52] as the the lion the ox the man and the
[36:58] ego praise the Lord Amen and we can hear
[37:04] there are places where Berta Branham
[37:06] called that God he touched there also
[37:08] with the four books of the New Testament
[37:12] amen that the New Testament church where
[37:16] God will be anointing and that's why we
[37:19] had Matthew Mark Luke and John you know
[37:22] they were just took
[37:23] it was like a god to the book of Acts
[37:26] praise the Lord
[37:27] but where I'm going with this is that
[37:30] these for anointing were not just there
[37:33] from the beginning because we realize in
[37:35] a book of Genesis when God torrenting
[37:40] Eve to leave his presence the Bible says
[37:43] he gathered the treat of life with
[37:46] turbines so the cherubim has been God
[37:49] right from the beginning amen
[37:53] when Moses got to Moses to build the
[37:57] tabernacle he told Moses when you build
[37:59] the Ark of the Covenant porch irving's
[38:02] build turbines of gold over the Ark of
[38:04] the Covenant to serve as a God so God
[38:08] has he has had this thing write down
[38:11] this this anointing has been there right
[38:14] down from the ages prays alone and and
[38:18] in everything in our in our salvation in
[38:22] our protection in our our deliverance in
[38:24] our healing there are works within in in
[38:28] a conference of this anointing now the
[38:31] way I want the reason what I'm going I'm
[38:33] going this way tonight is because I'm
[38:35] talking on healing amen and and and and
[38:39] so when we comes to healing here is a
[38:43] promise that the Sun of righteousness
[38:45] with rise with healing in his wings and
[38:48] we know there is only one healer and
[38:50] that healer is God prays alone but yet
[38:56] God because he works with with with the
[39:03] principle of his word he has distributed
[39:07] also this anointing this these four
[39:13] powers let me not call the beast for
[39:17] like a better world
[39:19] but these four power these four
[39:20] anointing is also manifested I want to
[39:24] bring this in a way to be able to help
[39:26] you tonight or help us to now so we can
[39:28] be able to look at this praise the Lord
[39:31] amen
[39:32] yes Jesus coming right down there and
[39:34] with their seeing this man of palsy the
[39:36] broad
[39:37] and he could see that the Bible says
[39:41] Jesus seen the effect he saw the fate of
[39:45] the people to just be able to approach
[39:47] God to go to God for healing amen
[39:51] he saw the effect and he said some be of
[39:59] a good chair they are saying I forgive
[40:03] me praise the Lord
[40:07] amen now we know that sin is the
[40:11] Serpent's head if you kill the head the
[40:14] entire body is dead it's in a sense sin
[40:18] is the cause of sickness we wouldn't
[40:22] have high any sickness in a word today
[40:24] if it's in had now started so Jesus was
[40:28] just stepping on the seven head amen
[40:33] praise the Lord amen
[40:36] so we see you there God through the ages
[40:42] he has been the God has healed but
[40:47] miracle divine healing and God has
[40:50] blessed our age with a miracle science I
[40:54] mean they have advanced and we know
[40:55] there's that's healing now the reason
[40:58] why I'm bringing is because I've said is
[41:00] over and over you know and like a
[41:03] crossword and and I'm trying to explain
[41:06] myself so you'll be able to understand
[41:08] me
[41:09] when I say that now when you look at
[41:12] this for anointing like we said there is
[41:15] there is the lion's anointing there is
[41:19] the Ox anointing we have the main
[41:23] anointing and we have the Eagle
[41:25] anointing and we apply the photo to
[41:29] healing tonight before I continue on
[41:32] with what I want to I want to look into
[41:35] and then we change the order of the
[41:36] service so we realize this this great
[41:44] anointing comes through the ministry
[41:46] tweak we apply to the church ages we're
[41:49] not dealing with there tonight with
[41:51] want to be able to apply to healing and
[41:54] it's as as much as it sounds you know
[41:58] shocking to many people even death is
[42:01] healing death is healing to the believer
[42:11] Amen praise the Lord
[42:15] oh that that age there is the greatest
[42:21] divine healing you can get hey praise
[42:27] the Lord because like Paul said if this
[42:31] border be dissolved there's another body
[42:34] waiting for us and and as believers
[42:37] we've been taught in the world when you
[42:39] died you you you don't cease from
[42:42] existing you leave this brother right
[42:45] into a better one you know there is no
[42:50] door moving there there are just no door
[42:55] moving and you see it as an age that is
[43:00] that it's preparing for the rapture that
[43:02] was the reason why brother Branham God
[43:05] gave brother Branham our for our age
[43:08] they experience beyond the curtains of
[43:10] time what I explained to us the reason
[43:15] why God allowed where Branham - how that
[43:17] experience is to be able to explain to
[43:20] us what happened when we leave this body
[43:25] that there is no draw moment you step
[43:29] out of this body you jump into another
[43:31] one praise the Lord
[43:35] amen while we are crying for you you
[43:38] just stay right there and you're just
[43:40] smiling
[43:44] that's why Paul says we don't weep like
[43:47] those that don't have hope
[43:51] amen we don't weep like duo's that don't
[43:54] have hope we whip because we've been as
[43:59] part of our fleshly saints amen when we
[44:04] get a little bit of sorrow we week and
[44:07] sometimes when you are too happy you
[44:10] week
[44:12] praise the Lord amen
[44:15] when when when I mean when something is
[44:19] happy to you that you know you don't
[44:21] deserve there is a mixed feeling I don't
[44:26] deserve this but I'm glad that I have it
[44:29] that's why he will wear our tears when
[44:35] we get on the other side
[44:39] praise the Lord
[44:41] this isn't that part of mine or I don't
[44:43] know where I'm going to Nebraska
[44:44] I don't know whether you are the one
[44:46] pulling me no Rupali me but I'm going to
[44:48] go in a way they mean because I myself
[44:51] I'm beginning to enjoy it
[44:55] praise the Lord amen
[44:57] so death is one of the best healing we
[45:01] were ever experienced amen
[45:04] so what a saint died from cancer or died
[45:07] from anything you know what the moment
[45:10] across this life amen
[45:14] the moment across this life they go into
[45:17] a better body without moping I mean the
[45:24] doctors have done an amazing surgery for
[45:27] sister Kish
[45:29] she she she has a brand new level but
[45:33] she has to deal with pain right now
[45:37] she's dealing with pain amen
[45:43] but if
[45:48] takes us out of this body no pain it's
[45:54] over with
[45:55] are we together tonight amen now so when
[46:00] you look out of that you will realize
[46:02] that any reason why I say that is
[46:07] because you will see some believers
[46:10] praying and trusting God for their
[46:12] healing and they are believing and they
[46:15] are believing you know I mean they are
[46:18] going through different things in their
[46:20] body
[46:20] but here they are still trusting God is
[46:22] still loving God and they are still
[46:24] serving God praise the Lord and it looks
[46:27] to the natural eyes that that that
[46:31] nothing is happening
[46:33] amen but in the eyes of God and
[46:37] according to Scripture what is happening
[46:40] there is that God has given that
[46:43] believer an ox anointing because the Ox
[46:48] anointing is the anointing that can be
[46:52] amen in our sorrow we can still trust
[46:57] God even though he's flaming I was still
[47:00] seven praise the Lord
[47:05] so as far as God is concerned that
[47:08] believer is healed as far as his word is
[47:12] concerned praise the Lord because you
[47:16] feeling sorry for him but he's praising
[47:19] God I thank God every day for the
[47:24] strength that he gives me I thank God
[47:27] every day I can be able to wake up you
[47:30] know and and and he's just praising God
[47:33] and you see there are many I mean they
[47:35] were prayed their hands will be laid on
[47:37] them but God will keep them in that
[47:40] state on tell to break into a new body
[47:47] praise the Lord
[47:53] why some some has faith they're lying on
[48:04] anointing here able to take God by his
[48:08] were still right there and take God by
[48:11] his word you see because the thing about
[48:13] it did is that you know sometimes it
[48:19] troubled the minds of Christians well
[48:24] it's as well if you know it's not really
[48:27] healing this is - how to go through
[48:29] surgery they will not be able to see
[48:33] that amen because in as far as their
[48:40] mind can conceive it is there
[48:43] the sickness should disappear amen to
[48:48] them when it don't disappeared no that's
[48:51] not healing the signet the doctors can
[48:59] join the bones together but it take God
[49:01] to heal it amen and you have to know in
[49:09] your mind every process of healing is
[49:12] creation every process of healing is
[49:17] creation if I will said the earth was
[49:22] without form
[49:23] it was vowed darkness was all over for
[49:26] God to bring and eating he had to bring
[49:29] healing to the earth he had to take the
[49:32] darkness away he had to gather the water
[49:35] one place there was a healing process so
[49:38] healing is a process and healing is the
[49:45] beauty of creation praise the Lord Amen
[49:49] so there are some you know that God will
[49:53] bless put down the the the the anointing
[49:58] Elias anointing I mean it would take God
[50:01] told by his word I mean we stand it we
[50:05] stand
[50:06] when the doctors say don't stand on the
[50:08] folder with sand on it they said God I
[50:11] take you by your word you know I'm a man
[50:13] trust in your word I'm going to take the
[50:16] first step
[50:18] praise the Lord amen and you see the
[50:25] those things just don't come overnight
[50:29] they don't come overnight because God
[50:32] don't play games he's not a magician
[50:33] he's the creator of heaven and earth you
[50:37] have to believe his word you have to
[50:40] live by his word you have to obey his
[50:42] word praise the Lord
[50:45] and above everything else you have to
[50:48] love God praise the Lord whether he will
[50:53] answer your prayer saying yes or no you
[50:56] have to love him praise the Lord
[51:06] those that are whole need not a
[51:08] physician we will get to that in a
[51:10] little bit here and so we see them you
[51:14] know those ones that an origin of faith
[51:17] it's the same is the same that God that
[51:22] is standing insane and take God by His
[51:25] Word and you know and and the one that
[51:30] is there the same the Lord is my healer
[51:36] but the estate bearing affection a
[51:39] flexion in their body amen
[51:42] and yesterday praising God amen I'll
[51:47] tell you tonight that person is better
[51:50] than the one that has his whole body
[51:52] well and can't even praise God now
[51:56] pressing is more alive because the Bible
[51:58] says let everything that have birth
[52:00] praise God and you can have your whole
[52:04] body well but if you can't praise God
[52:07] you are just like a dead man because
[52:10] only the dead that don't praise God amen
[52:16] so you see a scene you know loving God
[52:20] maybe they're in a wheelchair or there
[52:22] are no crutches then you then you stand
[52:24] there and feel so sorry for them oh my
[52:27] good and what God can heal him you just
[52:30] in a miserable condition your condition
[52:33] is more miserable than that person that
[52:37] is in that situation I mean your
[52:43] condition is more miserable do you know
[52:46] why because when God put a man in a
[52:50] certain condition a man and a woman what
[52:52] is a condition of disability God put
[53:00] them in that condition for you to be
[53:03] able to appreciate the beauty of
[53:06] creation
[53:15] praise the Lord and then that's where
[53:23] medical science comes in is under the
[53:25] man's anointing God will bless men he
[53:31] would bless me this mean they do surgery
[53:37] I mean god blessed him amen
[53:43] like the Lord just kind of patrols in
[53:46] the path of of this this doctor much you
[53:51] the ones have been helping my wife and
[53:54] some of the other sisters I mean just a
[53:56] godly Christian man he just a godly
[54:01] Christian man and and and this man
[54:04] approached his profession just like a
[54:07] preacher going to preach he goes and
[54:14] prayed when it's time for surgery he
[54:16] don't speak to anybody he even pray with
[54:23] his with his patients now some are not
[54:26] Christians but God has blessed him it
[54:30] has to be gone because only God is the
[54:34] creator so for a man to be able to have
[54:38] a to be able to pull one vein to another
[54:42] vein and and and and and and and and you
[54:45] know and and put it together for your
[54:47] blood to flow through it it has to be
[54:49] acknowledged from the Creator
[54:55] that's what brother Branham said he says
[54:58] there's a place in heaven for a god
[55:00] called doctor
[55:13] and then the miracle comes under the
[55:20] eager anointing because the Eagle that
[55:23] fly so high God just take the sickness
[55:26] away you know take the tumor away before
[55:29] the doctor hints
[55:30] that's the ego's anointing so that's
[55:34] your fault
[55:35] that's your full anointing God I mean
[55:37] that the Sun of righteousness rising
[55:40] with healing in his wings you know when
[55:43] when he when he rises with healing in
[55:45] his wings he blessed all these areas
[55:49] amen
[55:50] he blessed man to go down the street I
[55:53] mean pray for sake raise the dead he
[55:56] blessed them he also blessed you know
[55:58] Christians to trust God
[56:03] they will not deny God they were not
[56:06] denied their confession even on to the
[56:08] grave praise the Lord
[56:16] amen I mean I mean lovely people nice
[56:19] people I mean one of the last time I
[56:23] spoke with brother brother Lonnie good
[56:26] he was a good friend of mine he said he
[56:29] said brother Warren I'm trusting God for
[56:31] my healing he said I just don't want to
[56:34] give my body so I believe medical
[56:36] science but I don't want to give my body
[56:38] to chemo I'm going to trust God for my
[56:41] healing and if he calls me through this
[56:45] way I'm still going to praise him you
[56:48] know so all of those things so what are
[56:49] we talking about tonight it's only a
[56:52] data that I hold that don't need a
[56:54] physician praise the Lord
[56:58] now there's the physical part of
[57:01] sickness and different thing we are
[57:03] talking about you know what tonight but
[57:06] we also want to look at their spiritual
[57:09] part praise the Lord Amen because there
[57:14] that is the that is the sickness that is
[57:16] more dangerous the one that was
[57:18] separated from God amen
[57:26] the one that was separated from God
[57:30] that's the one that is more dangerous
[57:33] you know and then when we come to the
[57:36] place like like Jesus said I'm not come
[57:38] to call the righteous but I've come to
[57:40] call sinners to repentance amen
[57:45] so the the way to the healing of the
[57:49] spirit man is repentance the way to the
[57:59] healing of the spirit man is repentance
[58:06] are we together tonight now but that's a
[58:09] beautiful picture here that's a very
[58:12] beautiful picture I want for us to look
[58:14] out tonight and kind of for meditate
[58:17] upon it last night and you think about
[58:22] Matthew the very writer of this book
[58:25] that we just read tonight the Bible said
[58:28] he was a tax collector amen
[58:33] Matthew was a tax collector praise the
[58:37] Lord
[58:39] amen and and DOS and those are tax
[58:47] collectors in those days you know I mean
[58:52] that that that was a fortunate job that
[58:56] was not just a job that was giving you
[58:59] know to to anybody praise the Lord

[59:04] believe he trained himself in in fun
[59:07] eyes he had some financial ideas and in
[59:10] order of the adding you know whatever
[59:12] they were required of him that day for
[59:15] him to get that job praise the Lord and
[59:18] I believe the job pays him or else he
[59:21] was here he might have found something
[59:23] else to do but he was he was making good
[59:26] money and being a tax collector you know
[59:29] at that time you you you you know
[59:32] sometimes he bribery never started now

[1:00:06] table praise the Lord and and and and we
[1:00:12] found out I will I will now want to
[1:00:15] believe that my to you was not guilty of
[1:00:17] that amen
[1:00:20] and he was not he was not the man that
[1:00:24] was I mean he was a with with his
[1:00:26] position that he had issue have been in
[1:00:31] either the upper class or the middle
[1:00:34] class not not the lowest class if you
[1:00:37] are being somewhere writing me let's
[1:00:40] keep me in the middle praise the Lord
[1:00:43] Amen and in the scripture says he has
[1:00:52] Jesus just coming from this from this
[1:00:55] revival he just he just healed a man

[1:01:02] know wow I love the way to save the
[1:01:07] glorify God which had given such a power
[1:01:11] two men in a sense God has has has given
[1:01:16] such a power among us now right am on us

[1:01:26] Lord that we believe in a God that can
[1:01:29] heal the sick we believe in a God that

[1:01:35] that can change the sinner to a sane a
[1:01:38] God I can be able to destroy habits in a
[1:01:42] life of an individual praise the Lord
[1:01:45] you know that's one thing that happens
[1:01:48] to to our faith
[1:01:50] our Fed is reenergized every time when
[1:01:54] we trust God and we see him come on the
[1:01:56] scene there is something that just gives
[1:01:59] us strength to keep trusting him because
[1:02:04] he's a present tense God amen he's a
[1:02:09] present tense God so Jesus just came
[1:02:14] from out of this this meeting and the
[1:02:16] Bible says as he passed he saw this man
[1:02:19] macchu he saw this man sitting at his
[1:02:29] office amen

[1:02:35] the custom table and he was you know
[1:02:41] doing his working and and you know and
[1:02:44] and Jesus just just looked his way when
[1:02:48] it came to eyes contact my two eyes just
[1:02:51] look at his eyes he said follow me
[1:02:55] praise the Lord Amen gonna be easy to
[1:03:01] follow the law like that if you just
[1:03:04] look at you eye to eye but you see the
[1:03:06] problem most of the time he's trying to
[1:03:08] look at us and we are looking at
[1:03:09] something different
[1:03:10] he's trying to get our attention here
[1:03:13] and we take our eyes from there he gets
[1:03:15] here he tried to get our attention and
[1:03:17] we take our eyes from there I love it
[1:03:20] God God likes to look into your eyes
[1:03:25] praise the Lord
[1:03:27] but see what is happening here he calls
[1:03:30] marching and as it as it comes down and
[1:03:34] they are walking and March it is
[1:03:35] following this this this man and I will
[1:03:39] Lord Jesus Jesus go right down to the
[1:03:42] publicans and sinners he took much he
[1:03:46] below his class what is a great thing is
[1:03:51] a great invitation this is the man that
[1:03:53] he are talking about I mean everybody is
[1:03:56] talking something about him from the
[1:03:58] meeting he came from Wow he told the man
[1:04:00] your sin be forgiving we have never seen
[1:04:02] this I mean I'm
[1:04:03] man was bedridden and he pray for the
[1:04:06] man and a man came off the bed machi who
[1:04:09] have loved to be associated with that
[1:04:11] guy but yet he told machi as he walked
[1:04:16] down he brought him down to the lowest
[1:04:19] class praise the Lord my Jesus used to
[1:04:25] go into all of these parties with
[1:04:27] several wearing and everything praise
[1:04:30] the Lord
[1:04:32] but yeah he's down here eating what I
[1:04:34] have to put food in in leaves
[1:04:36] I wanna in his mind he's thinking wow
[1:04:41] really
[1:04:43] it's he really wigs praise the Lord I
[1:04:51] want to go somewhere with there tonight
[1:04:54] glory be to God amen and yet the
[1:05:00] Pharisees and then you know the the
[1:05:04] religious man of the hour when the side
[1:05:06] is you know no he just he just stepped
[1:05:09] below the line you know we highly esteem
[1:05:13] him but not getting down there and you
[1:05:15] know and you know eating with sinners
[1:05:19] for a matter of fact that was one of the
[1:05:21] things that the the disciple I mean the
[1:05:24] Pharisees accused Jesus of they called
[1:05:27] him a wine brother because he was always
[1:05:29] down eating and drinking with sinners
[1:05:31] you know any and he's guided on they
[1:05:34] don't they don't have that yeah yeah you
[1:05:36] know their feast with our wine so if
[1:05:39] Jesus is always down there with Benny
[1:05:41] just think that you know maybe he's a
[1:05:44] drunker
[1:05:46] praise the Lord amen
[1:05:52] but you have to remember this is the God
[1:05:57] that left his truth above
[1:06:01] amen and when he left his truth above he
[1:06:06] chose to be our neighbor he moves so
[1:06:11] close to us by taking on flesh and
[1:06:14] becoming one of us
[1:06:18] came in you don't call somebody you
[1:06:20] never I'll a far away the person have to
[1:06:23] be close the Bible says he is touched by
[1:06:27] the feelings of our imprimatur the Bible
[1:06:29] says he was tempted every way every way
[1:06:36] so he came so close left his throne
[1:06:39] about he descended to the lowest state
[1:06:44] and that was one of the first lesson
[1:06:47] that much you had to learn about the
[1:06:51] Lord Jesus
[1:06:52] the first lesson he had to learn about
[1:06:55] the Lord Jesus that the way up is down
[1:06:59] praise the Lord amen
[1:07:02] he humbled himself here all these
[1:07:05] religious guys are all know if he really
[1:07:08] were what he is he shouldn't have been
[1:07:09] like this he's eating and how your
[1:07:11] masters eat with sinners the Bible says
[1:07:15] and Jesus heard him and he says they
[1:07:18] that a whole don't need physician bar
[1:07:23] Branham said it should take one message
[1:07:29] to put you on fire for God it should
[1:07:34] take one preaching to put you to the
[1:07:40] place to make business with God if you
[1:07:43] take one service so stop you from
[1:07:50] playing Church praise the Lord I mean so
[1:08:01] I I think about this and I and I thought
[1:08:04] about it last night and and and and and
[1:08:07] and this is this is word this is where
[1:08:10] it comes it comes to my mind as a church
[1:08:16] and the place we find ourself the edge
[1:08:20] we find ourself in praise the Lord
[1:08:27] a few nights ago some brothers I wanted
[1:08:32] to talk to me about something and we
[1:08:37] were talking once there's something to
[1:08:41] mean I told him okay I with when the
[1:08:42] other one come you bring him alone at
[1:08:44] one a year where he got that information
[1:08:46] from we'll talk about it and and I saw
[1:08:53] the composition I saw them trying to
[1:08:55] pull my strings into argument but I've
[1:09:00] laid my guns down
[1:09:02] praise the Lord I told the brother
[1:09:06] that's his I won't waste my time to
[1:09:09] argue about anything I'll rather go and
[1:09:13] argue with a sinner to stop taking drugs
[1:09:20] I rather go and argue with him and tell
[1:09:24] him that I believe Jesus can change your
[1:09:27] life there for me to waste my time
[1:09:30] arguing what doctrine is writing what
[1:09:33] doctrine is not right I don't have time
[1:09:35] for that amen
[1:09:38] because it's only those that are sick
[1:09:41] that need physician many of us we have
[1:09:44] sat around so long and it's like our
[1:09:47] mind is makeup it looks like no
[1:09:51] preaching going to change your position
[1:09:55] amen it looks like you just come to
[1:09:59] witness the preacher and see what he's
[1:10:02] going to jump up and what he's going to
[1:10:05] run in what you know what is going to be
[1:10:07] like
[1:10:15] amen it's like we have our mind made up
[1:10:18] and we determine in our heart on terror
[1:10:23] it is our way we're not going to move
[1:10:28] you don't need a physician you don't
[1:10:34] need a physician until you comes to the
[1:10:38] place and realize that you are needing
[1:10:41] and you really need God every service
[1:10:45] would be very important to you praise
[1:10:52] the Lord I know this this little church
[1:10:56] has been blessed I remember one night we
[1:10:58] just we just got through preaching we
[1:11:00] had a service and we just wash it the
[1:11:03] Lord in and as soon as we came to the
[1:11:05] end of the service
[1:11:06] Geron ran from the street right in here
[1:11:09] to this pulpit and I mean she was just
[1:11:11] all I mean she just couldn't get her
[1:11:14] words and everything right I mean some
[1:11:16] some some of the believers have already
[1:11:18] left home and we were rounding and we
[1:11:21] had to spend time with hurting and pray
[1:11:23] them and I mean we are right we are
[1:11:25] right in in an area where we are exposed
[1:11:29] to that all the time sometimes I can't
[1:11:34] is parked right out there people coming
[1:11:36] and I mean it would knock on the door
[1:11:38] and remember a guy one time came in you
[1:11:46] know he was using sign language he
[1:11:49] couldn't talk and he realizes the car
[1:11:51] that somebody's supposed to be in there
[1:11:53] and I just heard it you know the bang on
[1:11:55] the door and you know bloody in and you
[1:11:57] know he told me what actually was
[1:11:59] happening to him and we see those things
[1:12:00] all the time and that's that's one good
[1:12:04] thing I like about this place for his
[1:12:08] Lord that's one good thing I like about
[1:12:12] this place
[1:12:17] well you see the like like you know
[1:12:21] blood brown talks about how we believers
[1:12:23] sometimes we become statue he main will
[1:12:29] become statute and sometimes we get to
[1:12:31] the place where we are just concerned
[1:12:33] about ourself we want a good service for
[1:12:37] ourselves praise the Lord let a little
[1:12:44] baby cried and we are the first thing
[1:12:45] what a mother can take the baby she did
[1:12:47] step in the service do you think about
[1:12:50] how much sacrifice they may for you to
[1:12:52] have a good service why if we have all
[1:12:54] of those baby in service tonight they
[1:12:56] don't yet the thing we are talking about
[1:13:00] they can just cried and shouting and
[1:13:03] this and anything about it there is data
[1:13:05] I listened to brother Branham all the
[1:13:08] time I hear children crying all over the
[1:13:09] place it don't stop that prophet he
[1:13:12] don't say take your baby out I got to a
[1:13:17] place one time I was in the service then
[1:13:19] and I saw what those brothers were doing
[1:13:21] you know zwip in the case for I told
[1:13:23] them I says don't do that I said don't
[1:13:26] do that I mean I mean it was they were
[1:13:34] becoming a little bit you know not in
[1:13:36] the sense of like encouraging the child
[1:13:38] or or maybe you know trying to help the
[1:13:42] child pay attention but I think they
[1:13:44] were going to the extreme it's all
[1:13:50] because we get to the place where
[1:13:54] sometimes we are so conscious of our
[1:13:57] convenience few weeks ago I got an email
[1:14:06] and I don't know how how this person got
[1:14:11] my email but someone from the
[1:14:13] neighborhood that's a gentleman that
[1:14:15] comes to church I would also be done
[1:14:17] with you I'm taking too much of the time
[1:14:19] tonight and at one time he came to
[1:14:24] service I mean he came right in the
[1:14:26] front seat here and we and we pray for
[1:14:29] him
[1:14:30] turn out to become a good friend of mine
[1:14:31] he would come around every time we see
[1:14:33] so one time he came out to service we
[1:14:35] hang out together took him across there
[1:14:37] to get some pizza and eat what what
[1:14:39] actually is is there he's in a group
[1:14:47] home somewhere back here so I decided to
[1:14:49] drive him I wanted to see where he where
[1:14:51] he lives so we went there in you know
[1:14:54] and then I dropped him off and each time
[1:14:56] a time we were meeting all of that you
[1:14:59] know and and and and just another time
[1:15:01] again it was there was another
[1:15:03] individual that comes coming to the
[1:15:05] church but what am I saying tonight
[1:15:09] Asuna those that are sick and needs the
[1:15:11] physician and who will be Jesus to them
[1:15:21] who will be Jesus to the ones that I
[1:15:25] need him praise the Lord
[1:15:30] you find people dealing with things in
[1:15:33] your lives and and I mean the struggle
[1:15:35] the struggle the struggle and and you
[1:15:38] you know and and and they just they just
[1:15:41] they just hurt himself you know you you
[1:15:43] can have the lying faith and stand in
[1:15:45] the face of the devil and defy the devil
[1:15:47] on the basis of God's Word
[1:15:49] praise the Lord and God can give you the
[1:15:52] victory for you to raise off from there
[1:15:55] because when the enemy comes as a flawed
[1:15:57] the Spirit of the Lord can raise up a
[1:15:59] standard but when after you have fun and
[1:16:01] you have fun and you realize you don't
[1:16:03] have strength ask for help
[1:16:10] praise the Lord
[1:16:12] because sometimes even when I know that
[1:16:17] oppression is struggling i found all
[1:16:21] sorts of ways to talk about it talk to
[1:16:23] them praise the Lord and sometimes you
[1:16:26] really see their most especially what
[1:16:29] breaks my heart when they start to
[1:16:31] become arrogant
[1:16:36] it just break my spirit are we together
[1:16:46] that's what the church is this is a soul
[1:16:53] clinic praise the Lord
[1:16:57] this is a soul clinic amen
[1:17:03] we come here to bring our knees to God
[1:17:08] we come here for God to help us all to
[1:17:12] help those that need help from God
[1:17:16] praise the Lord and that's why we oh
[1:17:19] that's that's that's our work that's why
[1:17:22] we create an atmosphere create an
[1:17:29] atmosphere for the Great Physician to
[1:17:31] comes down and many times I see if God
[1:17:38] comes down and you know I mean he just
[1:17:40] deliver people you just see clouds
[1:17:44] getting away from people life and spirit
[1:17:48] being cast out praise the Lord you love
[1:17:56] the law tonight amen

[1:21:55] those that are fake
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:05] and like I said before Christian life
[1:22:08] has never been an individual life
[1:22:12] no Christian life it's a body life when
[1:22:21] one man still the entire body feel
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:27] just like your entire body can add just
[1:22:35] lay it on just one part of the body it
[1:22:40] needs to hang they need a Fault in it
[1:22:42] and I in even years even the least
[1:22:45] member of your body that's very
[1:22:46] important and that just how the body of
[1:22:51] Jesus is that just had a Christian life
[1:22:55] is but sometimes people rolled into any
[1:23:00] view alive and they had their individual
[1:23:03] concept their individual representation
[1:23:04] they don't respect nothing the church
[1:23:07] belief it's well that's that's why you
[1:23:13] people believe I have my own word of
[1:23:15] light I have their own wait I have to do
[1:23:16] this I won't take you anywhere you just
[1:23:22] come to realize that you just become a
[1:23:24] selfish

[1:23:32] selfishness will affect the one that is
[1:23:36] becoming selfish it will not affect the
[1:23:40] people that you don't want to give to
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:56] let's just pray together tonight just
[1:24:00] before we come or change the order of
[1:24:05] the service I pray that God will be able
[1:24:13] to deal with our house tonight and
[1:24:15] condition our house even if you thank
[1:24:19] you in a position that maybe you did not
[1:24:25] expect convenient service tonight you
[1:24:28] think you're not prepare for it the
[1:24:31] taking of the bread and the wine

[1:24:38] go tonight
[1:24:41] you can come and take the bread and wine
[1:24:44] and yet your heart is still far from God
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:00] if you are baptized in the name of the
[1:25:03] Lord Jesus you have a right to the
[1:25:07] convenient tonight but yet if you're not
[1:25:11] living right

[1:25:24] that is wrong other Auto tonight and the
[1:25:30] reason what I want to do this church
[1:25:33] because I'm feeling the need in my heart
[1:25:37] that we need some cleaning up to do
[1:25:42] and that's the only way God will move in
[1:25:45] the mists of his people I don't want for
[1:25:49] us to take things lightly for us to be a
[1:25:51] church that is just callous but I want
[1:25:55] for us to be like that woman that is
