[45:45] but it is good to be in the house of the
[45:47] lord amen
[45:49] this morning we're going to
[45:52] talk uh on something that we long the
[45:54] waiter for musicians thank you
[45:56] you may have your seat and
[45:59] i promised i was going to speak on the
[46:01] treasure of the snow
[46:04] i want to speak on there this morning
[46:07] the treasure of the snow
[46:10] praise the lord so the lord bless you
[46:13] let's stand to our
[46:14] feet let's take our bibles in the book
[46:16] of job
[46:19] the treasure of the snow
[46:26] sometimes it's it's uh it's it's very
[46:30] varied uh i cannot say this morning
[46:34] in a way that god deals with uh
[46:36] sometimes something from the word of god
[46:38] catch your mind
[46:39] and you're trying to study that and and
[46:41] as much as the word of god is
[46:43] encouraging
[46:45] but it is really not coming together and
[46:47] sometimes god would just take a simple
[46:49] simple action of an individual or a
[46:52] simple word someone would say
[46:54] and it would just bring the picture
[46:55] together i think that that is one of
[46:58] this
[46:58] uh many of you preachers and and bible
[47:01] readers know what i'm talking about
[47:03] but it's one of this there's just
[47:05] something that just brought this whole
[47:07] thing together for me
[47:09] um i wish of course i will be talking
[47:11] about it different than i thought i
[47:13] would have
[47:14] spoken about it job chapter 38
[47:17] job chapter 38
[47:20] praise the lord job chapter 38
[47:27] and again one of the reasons why the
[47:28] hair back i was waiting for the heavy
[47:30] snow day
[47:32] amen where you come to church in in and
[47:34] all your boots are filled with snow
[47:36] and you cover with snow then i think
[47:40] i thought that that would be a good time
[47:42] to preach this
[47:52] uh praise the lord
[47:56] praise the lord job chapter 38
[48:01] let's read from verse 1. job chapter 38
[48:05] let's read from verse 1.
[48:08] then the lord answered job out of the
[48:10] way wayne and said
[48:13] who is this that darkened counsel
[48:18] by words without wisdom
[48:22] now this this is coming very sobering to
[48:25] me so
[48:26] uh the language year means so much
[48:30] you you just have to grab it you mean
[48:33] who is this that that can counsel by
[48:35] words without wisdom
[48:36] get up that limbs like a man for i
[48:40] will demand of thee and answer
[48:44] thou mean where will out when i laid the
[48:48] foundation
[48:49] of the earth declared if they all have
[48:52] understanding
[48:56] who have laid the measures thereof if
[48:59] they are know it
[49:00] or who have stretched the line
[49:04] upon it praise the lord but let's drop
[49:08] down to verse 22.
[49:18] god is dealing with with different
[49:19] things here but then he mentioned this
[49:23] have thou entered into the treasures
[49:27] of the snow all have thou
[49:30] seen the treasures of the hell
[49:34] praise the lord which i have reserved
[49:37] against
[49:38] the time of trouble against
[49:42] the day of battle and war when i read
[49:45] that part of the part of the scripture i
[49:47] could not
[49:48] help but think about one of david mann
[49:51] fighting in the snow the bible says he
[49:53] killed a lion
[49:56] in the snow so god reserve
[49:59] the snow for the days of battle
[50:03] how you think about a cold day for the
[50:05] days of battle
[50:08] but let's pray together heavenly father
[50:11] we will ask your blessings upon your
[50:12] word
[50:14] come lord jesus speak to us lord not
[50:16] with him or knowledge of god
[50:18] but lord father with the inspiration of
[50:20] the almighty
[50:22] may something be said lord father that
[50:24] will draw us
[50:25] closer to you we love you and we
[50:28] appreciate you
[50:29] in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord
[50:33] bless you you may have your seed
[50:35] amen praise the lord
[50:39] hallelujah
[50:44] we thank the lord for the service
[50:47] last week i thought that that was a
[50:53] nice uh teaching presentation that
[50:56] brother lloyd did and uh and also the
[51:00] prayer meeting
[51:01] on wednesday night uh in
[51:04] in the week i got a message from a
[51:07] friend
[51:08] in uh south africa he sent me in the uh
[51:12] the air prayer chain and what the
[51:15] what they had is that they had a thirty
[51:16] minute section and
[51:18] uh from six a.m in the morning until
[51:22] i think six a.m the next morning and and
[51:25] family school
[51:26] could text him to fill in the 10-minute
[51:28] section that they want to take
[51:30] they want to take their teddy meetings
[51:31] to pray and
[51:33] uh and and i i just looking through it
[51:37] and i says oh yeah that's that's
[51:38] interesting and uh
[51:41] and then when i look and look i saw
[51:45] from 10 30 to 11 p.m
[51:49] from 11 p.m to 11 30
[51:52] and then nobody feel in the game
[51:56] until early in the morning i say yeah
[51:58] yeah yeah
[52:00] he gave his beloved sleepy man
[52:06] praise the lord but uh yeah i think it's
[52:09] uh
[52:09] it's a beautiful time many many many of
[52:12] the same cell
[52:12] around the world most especially the
[52:14] brothers there in south africa
[52:16] uh most of their services are closed
[52:18] down because of
[52:20] the new string of ours that is coming
[52:22] from the outside of the word
[52:25] we we we want to keep them in our prayer
[52:28] constantly praise the lord
[52:31] uh and that's the reason why that
[52:35] i still believe that we will keep our
[52:38] prayer meeting
[52:39] uh going just like we started uh
[52:43] before the end of the year and those
[52:45] that are stay
[52:46] on on the prayer chain those times stay
[52:49] there
[52:50] you will definitely find somebody
[52:52] praying that you can
[52:54] join uh 6 a.m 9 00
[52:58] am 12 at noon 3 pm
[53:01] 6 pm any of those time that you can be
[53:04] able to
[53:04] just set a time aside and pray
[53:08] that will be a blessing praise the lord
[53:12] amen that would be a blessing
[53:15] the truth about the motto that is that
[53:17] you have to remember whenever
[53:19] you get on your knees to pray there is
[53:22] always somebody
[53:23] around the world that is praying with
[53:25] you
[53:26] praise the lord so uh let's keep those
[53:30] prayer
[53:31] chain going in and we will continue our
[53:33] prayer meetings wednesday night
[53:36] and i believe that was a good
[53:39] faith message but then preach on
[53:41] wednesday night
[53:43] we we appreciate that praise the lord
[53:46] and
[53:50] i was thinking about i had on my heart
[53:52] that i was going to preach on the
[53:54] message
[53:55] the fear of being caught
[53:59] the fear of being caught
[54:02] but damn spoke a little bit about fear
[54:06] it didn't change my my subject
[54:10] uh actually but a little of what
[54:13] brother lloyd brought on sunday and
[54:16] uh you know uh
[54:20] getting you know not not aiming
[54:23] my coming shot of him in the mic you
[54:26] know
[54:26] uh
[54:32] as he was speaking the thought of that
[54:34] was going through my mind
[54:36] because i i've been studying on that i
[54:38] was i was actually listening
[54:40] to uh to a preacher the old friend of
[54:42] mine and he was saying something
[54:44] and he and he made reference on that and
[54:47] it and it caught my mind
[54:49] and i realized as i said to myself i
[54:51] said
[54:52] actually that's what many of us
[54:55] deal with i don't know whether you have
[54:57] been there but i have been there before
[54:59] the fear of being caught
[55:02] oh yeah and and uh uh like you you
[55:06] think think about it think about it this
[55:08] way
[55:10] i mean uh uh you don't want
[55:14] the rapture going and you are left here
[55:18] do you think about that sometimes do we
[55:20] scare you
[55:23] i don't want to be caught here it does
[55:25] not means that
[55:27] you are you are losing faith or you
[55:29] don't have faith
[55:33] praise the lord but uh uh
[55:37] i decided to look at some some few other
[55:40] things so
[55:41] we will trust the law to be able to
[55:42] bring that
[55:44] uh in some time
[55:47] now when looking at this subject about
[55:50] the treasure of the snow
[55:52] i thought that uh if uh
[55:56] the first time i i read this
[56:00] and i was looking at it my mind was just
[56:03] filled
[56:03] of uh scientific proof
[56:06] i needed to bring out things that we can
[56:10] benefit from from the snow
[56:12] so it kind of delayed me because i
[56:15] started making some
[56:16] search and making some search and and
[56:18] even though there were a lot of things
[56:20] that
[56:20] that i saw which of course i would share
[56:23] a few here with you um some very
[56:30] beautiful thoughts
[56:32] snow in nothing countries
[56:36] is
[56:39] is a special blessing of providence
[56:45] for by covering the earth
[56:48] it prevents combs and other vegetables
[56:52] from being destroyed by the intense
[56:56] cold
[56:59] of the air in the in the winter months
[57:04] and especially preserve them
[57:07] from co-piercing wing
[57:11] so as you cover the earth is keeping our
[57:14] food it's keeping the soil
[57:15] healthy for for another good season of
[57:19] planting all the seeds that are honored
[57:24] in
[57:30] it is not a fact that it possesses in
[57:32] itself
[57:33] and in fertilizing quality such as
[57:35] neutral soil
[57:37] are calling to uh many opinions
[57:42] its whole use is covering
[57:46] the vegetable from intense coal and thus
[57:50] preventing the natural heat of the earth
[57:55] from escaping so that the intense core
[57:59] cannot freeze
[58:01] the juice in the tenor tubes of
[58:04] vegetable
[58:06] which will rupture those tubes
[58:09] and so destroy the plant now so those
[58:12] are some of the few things i was
[58:14] i was gathering as i was looking at the
[58:16] benefit of snow
[58:18] but it just it just it was going to be
[58:22] a subject of too much information
[58:26] but what i was looking for i was looking
[58:28] for inspiration
[58:32] because there is a difference of having
[58:34] too much
[58:35] information that are not inspiring
[58:41] you can have too much information and
[58:43] there is no inspiration in it
[58:46] so uh
[58:51] so i will be going a little bit
[58:52] different from bringing you all of these
[58:54] information i mean you can make research
[58:57] on it
[58:57] and and another thing i was reading
[59:00] about you know how the snow
[59:01] fall the flakes fall and and many has
[59:04] been able to look at it
[59:06] and it has a six-pointed style you know
[59:10] uh i mean when you when you be able to
[59:12] look at it through
[59:13] a telescope or something like that and
[59:15] and the thing about it there is there to
[59:17] see how
[59:18] light they are when they are falling
[59:22] but when they come down and join
[59:23] together they become solid ice
[59:26] if you don't take time to walk you know
[59:29] where you find yourself
[59:34] praise the lord amen so
[59:37] i mean we can talk about that and talk
[59:38] about that but i want to go in a
[59:40] different direction this morning
[59:42] the reason why is that this conversation
[59:46] came up when god was responding
[59:51] to job and his friends
[59:55] amen now this was god
[59:59] asking job have you ever been to the
[1:00:01] treasure of the snow
[1:00:03] do you even know that the snow has a
[1:00:05] treasure
[1:00:08] praise the lord and i mean
[1:00:11] the creator of heaven and earth he have
[1:00:14] enough information he could have told
[1:00:17] job
[1:00:18] the snow can do this and the snow can do
[1:00:20] this and the snow can do this
[1:00:22] he could have just gone ahead and headed
[1:00:25] but you see the thing about
[1:00:26] it there is that god was not giving job
[1:00:30] information he made their statement
[1:00:34] to give job an inspiration
[1:00:41] are we together praise the lord
[1:00:44] so i hope i can be able to give you an
[1:00:46] inspiration this morning
[1:00:49] something about me said i might give you
[1:00:51] an inspiration that can open another
[1:00:53] word for you
[1:00:57] because that's what the holy ghost does
[1:01:01] praise the lord so if you go and search
[1:01:03] and and set it you'll get a lot of lot
[1:01:05] of
[1:01:06] wonderful things that are hidden in the
[1:01:09] treasure
[1:01:10] of the snow
[1:01:14] praise the lord so i just took that as a
[1:01:17] title this morning
[1:01:19] but uh my my inspiration and what i'll
[1:01:22] be dealing on
[1:01:23] this morning is talking
[1:01:26] more about treasure
[1:01:30] talking more about treasure so let's
[1:01:32] just
[1:01:33] let's just read
[1:01:37] i have heard but now i see
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:45] i might not keep you alone and uh
[1:01:49] if i can be able to to to ending a good
[1:01:53] time here
[1:01:56] then brothers maybe we can just meet for
[1:01:58] a few minutes and cap
[1:02:00] what we wanted to share with you and uh
[1:02:03] it's just it's just more of an
[1:02:05] information something for us to be
[1:02:07] praying about
[1:02:08] that i wanted to to share with you
[1:02:13] so let's just read uh i mean this this
[1:02:15] might be our only
[1:02:17] uh quote that we'll be reading from
[1:02:20] maybe something else will come up now i
[1:02:22] have heard but now i see
[1:02:24] now we find out and take
[1:02:27] some of his life when god blessed him
[1:02:31] and made him a great man talking about
[1:02:34] job why
[1:02:35] even everybody respected him even
[1:02:39] told even to his wisdom
[1:02:45] even to his wisdom had become so great
[1:02:49] his inspiration from god has dedicated
[1:02:53] him to
[1:02:53] be god's seven so plainly
[1:02:57] until the people came from everywhere
[1:03:00] to hear him now think about that the
[1:03:03] people came from everywhere to hear him
[1:03:05] who else comes in your mind
[1:03:12] solomon solomon
[1:03:16] so keep that in your mind because we'll
[1:03:17] visit solomon
[1:03:19] as we talk about this
[1:03:23] but let me read another scripture here
[1:03:26] first corinthian chapter eight first
[1:03:29] corinthians chapter eight it's a it's a
[1:03:31] very
[1:03:32] uh uh familiar verse that we all read
[1:03:37] and uh uh but i will uh let's read from
[1:03:41] verse one
[1:03:42] first corinthians chapter 8 reading from
[1:03:44] verse 1 now as touching things
[1:03:48] offer unto idols we
[1:03:51] know that we all have
[1:03:54] knowledge praise the lord
[1:03:58] as touching things offer unto others
[1:04:02] we know that we all have knowledge
[1:04:05] knowledge puffed up but charity
[1:04:08] edified if you look at the context of
[1:04:12] this
[1:04:13] something paul is bringing out here is
[1:04:16] dead
[1:04:17] we all have knowledge so based on our
[1:04:19] knowledge
[1:04:20] we can be judgmental we can
[1:04:23] misunderstand people
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:31] then he goes ahead and says here
[1:04:34] if any man thinks that he knoweth
[1:04:38] anything if any man
[1:04:41] thinks think now that he really know
[1:04:47] but he thinks
[1:04:50] that he knows
[1:04:54] anything he knoweth
[1:04:58] nothing praise the lord
[1:05:03] yet as he ought to know
[1:05:09] praise the lord so you take this you
[1:05:13] take
[1:05:14] a verse one you bring it right into the
[1:05:16] setting of what we're about to talk
[1:05:18] about
[1:05:19] here job was expressing what
[1:05:22] he thought he knew
[1:05:25] your friends they were also expressing
[1:05:28] what they knew
[1:05:33] but all of their knowledge was far from
[1:05:36] the reality
[1:05:39] was far from the reality remember
[1:05:42] brother branham says all all that that
[1:05:46] we will ever
[1:05:47] know we just amount to
[1:05:50] a grain of sin we have to realize that
[1:05:56] praise the lord the four give us a
[1:06:00] canary brain
[1:06:03] that's what he said amen
[1:06:07] let me ask you a question
[1:06:12] who was the oldest man in the bible
[1:06:16] mentula do you know
[1:06:20] that menthusila died before his father
[1:06:38] am i preaching false doctrine
[1:06:42] is he a contradiction enoch was his
[1:06:45] father
[1:06:56] i just wanted to wake you up
[1:07:00] if any man thinks he knows
[1:07:05] if any man thinks he knows
[1:07:17] so let's go back here
[1:07:21] i've heard but now i see now we find out
[1:07:24] and we take some of his life that's job
[1:07:27] when god
[1:07:28] blessed him and god made him a great man
[1:07:31] you have to be careful with that
[1:07:33] whatever god bless you with whether it's
[1:07:35] a gift
[1:07:35] whether it's it's knowledge whether it's
[1:07:37] a talent whatever god bless you with you
[1:07:40] have to realize it's a gift from
[1:07:42] god you don't own it
[1:07:44] [Music]
[1:07:46] it's not your property
[1:07:54] why even everybody respected him
[1:07:59] even his wisdom has become so great his
[1:08:01] inspiration from god
[1:08:03] has vindicated him to be god seven so
[1:08:06] plainly until
[1:08:07] the people come from everywhere to hear
[1:08:10] him
[1:08:11] and then satan begin to accuse that man
[1:08:18] and that's the reason why you're having
[1:08:20] all the problems you are having let me
[1:08:21] let you know
[1:08:22] because satan is accusing you
[1:08:26] praise the lord
[1:08:30] and that's the way he does every
[1:08:34] inspired servant of god
[1:08:37] not every child but every inspired
[1:08:40] servant of god
[1:08:42] praise the lord that's the way he does
[1:08:45] every
[1:08:45] inspired servant of god
[1:08:54] this does that only means every preacher
[1:08:57] it means every child of god that has
[1:09:01] been
[1:09:01] caught by an inspiration amen
[1:09:04] every child of god has come to
[1:09:07] consciousness
[1:09:08] that god is dealing with their lives
[1:09:14] i mean they are not just going to church
[1:09:18] as a church member they are not just
[1:09:20] serving god in terms of religion
[1:09:23] but they realize that god is dealing
[1:09:25] with him
[1:09:32] satan is always there to accuse him of
[1:09:36] everything that he does that's not right
[1:09:41] now we find out his life and his trials
[1:09:45] and his great faith even jesus
[1:09:48] when he come on the earth he referred to
[1:09:51] the passion
[1:09:52] of job praise the lord
[1:09:57] but the joke knew he had patience no
[1:10:02] no job wanted to die
[1:10:05] why can't i just die and let this thing
[1:10:07] be open
[1:10:10] praise the lord because he was only in
[1:10:13] the moment
[1:10:17] he was in the moment of what was going
[1:10:20] on
[1:10:22] but beyond behind all of that
[1:10:27] expression behind all of that
[1:10:29] frustration
[1:10:30] there was something there was something
[1:10:32] that was holding him
[1:10:34] there was a patient that was holding him
[1:10:39] praise the lord
[1:10:44] now patience is a virtue as we always
[1:10:47] say
[1:10:48] passion does not means wait
[1:10:53] i was waiting on on on him for him to
[1:10:55] get there but he said i have so much
[1:10:56] patience you are missing two things
[1:11:06] praise the lord
[1:11:12] see his life has tried his thing
[1:11:15] jesus referred to the patient of job he
[1:11:17] says
[1:11:18] have you not read of the passion of job
[1:11:23] faith waits with patience for the
[1:11:25] promised world
[1:11:26] to be fulfilled can we say amen to death
[1:11:29] amen faith weight
[1:11:33] with patience so weight is not patient
[1:11:41] faith wait with patience
[1:11:44] for the promised world to be fulfilled
[1:11:49] patience is an unseen virtue
[1:11:55] praise the lord amen
[1:12:02] now we notice here that joke after
[1:12:05] after he went through his trial all
[1:12:09] his affliction he had a lovely family
[1:12:13] they were taken from him he had good
[1:12:16] health
[1:12:16] it was taken from him everything that he
[1:12:19] owns in this life was taken
[1:12:23] and he said on arrash hip with a piece
[1:12:25] of crook stripping
[1:12:27] his boards and even to his own wife
[1:12:30] spoke against himself why
[1:12:32] not curse girl and die
[1:12:37] praise the lord amen now you have to
[1:12:40] understand
[1:12:41] like like you know brother branham
[1:12:43] referred he says he never said job wife
[1:12:45] was foolish he said why are you speaking
[1:12:46] like a foolish woman
[1:12:49] amen now you have to think about it
[1:12:52] if if this woman after job trial you
[1:12:55] also have to put
[1:12:56] into perspective how long job trial was
[1:13:01] and honor a divine lord she could not go
[1:13:04] and get married
[1:13:06] and if she had children after job trial
[1:13:11] which means she was a young woman
[1:13:14] so her language of frustration there
[1:13:17] were
[1:13:18] there were a lot of things while she was
[1:13:19] expressing that
[1:13:22] because she's only free from her husband
[1:13:24] if he's dead
[1:13:32] she was not saying that in a sense of
[1:13:34] despising god
[1:13:36] she was not saying that because she did
[1:13:38] not believe
[1:13:40] but she was a woman
[1:13:43] she had feelings
[1:13:53] praise the lord that's why she was not a
[1:13:56] foolish woman
[1:13:57] but she was speaking like a foolish
[1:13:58] woman
[1:14:02] because if she was a foolish woman she
[1:14:04] would go and just be living foolishly
[1:14:07] and don't care that her husband is going
[1:14:09] through that
[1:14:18] praise the lord can we say amen
[1:14:22] praise the lord i don't normally ask for
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:28] it's good when you have amen praise the
[1:14:31] lord
[1:14:33] he said the lord give it the lord take
[1:14:35] it away blessed be
[1:14:37] the name of the lord now satan hype
[1:14:41] come up before god cause he could come
[1:14:44] before god and accuse the christian or
[1:14:47] the believer
[1:14:48] all the time so he accused job
[1:14:51] of many things and and and said that
[1:14:54] that job the reason he could serve
[1:14:57] god because everything was coming
[1:15:01] good for him if satan should accuse
[1:15:05] us we'll sit and be right
[1:15:11] if satan would take this accusation
[1:15:14] before god
[1:15:15] for you will he be right
[1:15:21] praise the lord
[1:15:25] well definitely for some people he will
[1:15:27] be right
[1:15:29] because let's try us you know strike
[1:15:31] them you don't see them anymore
[1:15:37] for many of the people in a prosperity
[1:15:39] gospel i mean he will be right
[1:15:43] they are singing with the band and they
[1:15:45] are dancing to the music because
[1:15:46] everything is going right
[1:15:56] we'll get into our our hesitation here
[1:16:03] but said if you just let me have him in
[1:16:07] my hands
[1:16:08] i would cause i will make him curse you
[1:16:13] to your face i want you to notice
[1:16:17] that the confidence that god had
[1:16:21] in a believer praise the lord
[1:16:25] the confidence that god have in a
[1:16:28] son or a daughter
[1:16:37] in other words god said to sit on like
[1:16:41] this
[1:16:41] you can do it he's
[1:16:46] a just man justifying he's a good man
[1:16:50] there is none not one like him in the
[1:16:54] whole earth
[1:16:55] or what a man that god himself
[1:16:59] will say to his enemy my seven
[1:17:02] is so perfect
[1:17:06] praise the lord and i believe that's
[1:17:08] what god will say to the devil
[1:17:10] concerning the bride
[1:17:13] that's what he will say concerning the
[1:17:16] bride because the bride
[1:17:18] is wrap up in the righteousness of jesus
[1:17:20] christ
[1:17:24] amen he will say that and he said that
[1:17:27] to the devil all the time
[1:17:29] satan you are a liar they never did it
[1:17:31] in the first place
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:38] praise the lord now the thing about it
[1:17:40] there is that god is saying it on your
[1:17:42] behalf
[1:17:43] can you say amen to what god is saying
[1:17:46] can your life say amen to what god is
[1:17:49] saying
[1:17:50] he's speaking on your behalf
[1:17:58] praise the lord oh what a man
[1:18:01] that god himself who said to his enemy
[1:18:04] my seven is so perfect there is there is
[1:18:07] not
[1:18:08] another man on the earth like him think
[1:18:11] about that
[1:18:12] that was just joke one man
[1:18:16] think about the day that we are living
[1:18:18] in
[1:18:19] think about the things thinking about
[1:18:21] how the church has gone
[1:18:22] so low how we are allowing
[1:18:26] and the church has allowed all of the
[1:18:29] things that is happening
[1:18:30] the i mean the filthiness the immorality
[1:18:35] and god looking down on laodicean age
[1:18:40] and saying i have a people
[1:18:45] praise the lord i have a people
[1:18:53] are we together i have a people
[1:19:02] i believe the same way that god fed
[1:19:04] about job
[1:19:05] in his time the same way he felt about
[1:19:09] abraham
[1:19:10] when abraham was just alone
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:19] the scripture said somewhere i just
[1:19:21] reading this kind of
[1:19:22] floating over my mind that abraham one
[1:19:26] man
[1:19:26] god gave him the land and he inherited
[1:19:30] and here we are many
[1:19:34] i think that was that was uh either in
[1:19:36] jeremiah there or
[1:19:38] ezekiel rebuking israel
[1:19:42] abraham one man god gave him the land
[1:19:45] and by promise
[1:19:46] he inherited
[1:19:52] and yeah we are many and we cannot
[1:19:55] possess it
[1:20:03] but i believe just as god spoke on
[1:20:06] behalf of job
[1:20:07] and talked about abraham i believe
[1:20:10] that's the way he looks at his bride
[1:20:12] amen i believe that's the way he looks
[1:20:16] at his dedicated sons and daughters
[1:20:24] we might be broken we might be trouble
[1:20:27] there might be a lot of questions in our
[1:20:29] mind like job had
[1:20:32] god did not change his testimony about
[1:20:34] job
[1:20:36] because of job questions
[1:20:40] god did not change his testimony because
[1:20:42] of job
[1:20:44] a frustration some of the things he said
[1:20:48] out of frustration
[1:20:51] god did not change his testimony
[1:20:57] praise the lord and that's that's why we
[1:20:58] want to look at that
[1:21:00] is the treasure that i want us to
[1:21:03] enter in this morning there is a
[1:21:06] treasure there
[1:21:07] there are there are a lot of things the
[1:21:09] thing about it there
[1:21:10] is that we have never
[1:21:14] known god
[1:21:17] before the fall
[1:21:20] why because we were all born in sinship
[1:21:22] like in iniquity
[1:21:24] come to the word speaking lies he deal
[1:21:26] with our heart
[1:21:27] so we are knowing god after the fall
[1:21:32] we have never known life
[1:21:36] before the fall that's the reason why
[1:21:40] you can put into context when paul said
[1:21:43] eyes have not seen ears have not heard
[1:21:49] neither have it come close to our heart
[1:21:54] what is in store
[1:21:58] praise the lord moses by vision when he
[1:22:01] wrote genesis 1 and 2
[1:22:04] before the fall there was there was not
[1:22:07] a lot of things he said
[1:22:08] it took brother branham to come and give
[1:22:11] us a little picture
[1:22:13] of how adam named the animals and how
[1:22:16] adam said mountains i don't like you
[1:22:17] you move here and all of that that was
[1:22:20] just to give us an
[1:22:21] idea a little bit of how life was before
[1:22:24] the fall
[1:22:30] are we together
[1:22:34] praise the lord
[1:22:38] oh if we could only be
[1:22:41] that kind of a man that god
[1:22:44] could bestow that confidence upon us
[1:22:51] i know that we will not twist
[1:22:55] from his word all from his being
[1:22:58] no matter what people say about the
[1:23:00] message no matter what it says about
[1:23:02] brother branham
[1:23:04] they can go and bring his birth
[1:23:05] certificate and say his name was not
[1:23:07] mariam
[1:23:08] he make it up to maryam and and it is
[1:23:11] not the man
[1:23:13] it is not the man
[1:23:16] it's what god is doing in my
[1:23:20] life in your life
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:28] what what what is the benefit of a god
[1:23:31] that could use
[1:23:33] brother branham to that extent and he
[1:23:36] can't change my life
[1:23:37] what is the benefit of saving that god
[1:23:41] i don't want the measure of his gift
[1:23:45] i don't want to be another brother
[1:23:47] brandon i want to be blotted one but i
[1:23:49] want to experience god
[1:23:51] in a measure where god is real to me
[1:24:05] could god find a man or a woman that
[1:24:08] god could be stole such a confidence
[1:24:11] upon
[1:24:12] upon us that i know that we will not
[1:24:16] twist from his word
[1:24:19] amen and if you realize that was
[1:24:22] one of the outstanding attitude about
[1:24:25] job
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:29] he had his integrity
[1:24:34] many scholars try they tried to bring
[1:24:37] this argument that's the reason why they
[1:24:39] established the thought
[1:24:41] that uh job scene that he had
[1:24:44] was fear because the thing he
[1:24:48] he was afraid of that's what he came on
[1:24:50] he says joe was just so much of himself
[1:24:52] and and that's that's that's that's not
[1:24:54] really that's that's the hemato but
[1:24:56] let's let's not go into an argument here
[1:24:57] let's stay with this
[1:24:59] because uh if we stay with this the law
[1:25:01] will bless us if we're going to anything
[1:25:02] else i'm not sure
[1:25:06] praise the lord i'm not sure
[1:25:10] to know that we will not twist from his
[1:25:12] word or his being
[1:25:13] anyway stay exactly and
[1:25:16] he can put his trust
[1:25:21] in us praise the lord
[1:25:25] that god can trust you
[1:25:28] that i know my son i know my daughter
[1:25:32] no matter what they are dealing with
[1:25:37] praise the lord amen
[1:25:45] and and it is the same word when we
[1:25:48] constantly goes back to the father
[1:25:51] now making excuses of our wrong
[1:25:56] praise the lord where we make excuses
[1:26:00] is where we have the fear of being
[1:26:03] caught
[1:26:07] praise the lord we make those excuses
[1:26:10] and and that is the reason why people
[1:26:13] make excuses
[1:26:14] because they are afraid that they will
[1:26:16] be caught
[1:26:20] amen oh yeah they are afraid that they
[1:26:23] will be caught
[1:26:28] are we together
[1:26:39] well may the lord help us
[1:26:45] now so we want to look in this now
[1:26:47] brother branham i took this from uh
[1:26:49] i've heard and now i've seen in
[1:26:51] broadband there was talking about the
[1:26:53] channel of
[1:26:54] inspiration i could read a lot of the
[1:26:56] calls to you
[1:26:57] but this is what i want to grab your
[1:26:58] mind let's go back to job
[1:27:00] 38. let's go back to job 38
[1:27:07] let's go back to job 38 and we can just
[1:27:10] look at this together
[1:27:12] and uh and trust that the law will be
[1:27:14] able to
[1:27:16] to just bless our thought here i believe
[1:27:18] he has already blessed amen
[1:27:20] praise the lord amen
[1:27:28] i believe you have already blessed then
[1:27:30] the lord answered job out of a railway
[1:27:32] saying who is this who is this that dark
[1:27:36] in council
[1:27:37] by words without knowledge who is this
[1:27:41] that darkened council by words
[1:27:45] with our knowledge praise the lord
[1:27:51] there's uh that's there's just there's
[1:27:53] just a lot of thing there
[1:27:56] that we want to look at we pick up
[1:28:06] praise the lord and then he went up and
[1:28:09] and over a year he says where was that
[1:28:12] when i lay the foundation of the earth
[1:28:14] we rejoice in this praise the lord
[1:28:19] amen and i i remember myself preaching
[1:28:22] this before
[1:28:23] if god will ask me that question i know
[1:28:25] what to tell him because the prophet
[1:28:26] have already told us
[1:28:30] god could ask job that question but he
[1:28:32] can't ask me
[1:28:34] i would tell him where was that i will
[1:28:36] write in your mind
[1:28:42] praise the lord but let's let's look at
[1:28:45] it
[1:28:45] let's look at in the word of the lord
[1:28:47] let's look at it
[1:28:49] and see where was god bringing job to
[1:28:52] when god came on the scene where was he
[1:28:56] bringing now we have to remember brother
[1:28:58] branham says
[1:28:59] he's not an investigating angel
[1:29:02] he does not count down to condemn you
[1:29:06] he comes down to convict you he comes
[1:29:09] down to
[1:29:10] help you to have a little more of
[1:29:12] understanding
[1:29:13] than what you have because if any man
[1:29:16] thinks he knows
[1:29:20] he he knows nothing and he don't know as
[1:29:24] he
[1:29:24] ought to know
[1:29:28] so every time god comes down every time
[1:29:32] he comes
[1:29:32] and and open your understanding to deal
[1:29:35] with you
[1:29:36] sometimes it's not telling you two plus
[1:29:39] two is full
[1:29:41] but sometimes he's challenging you
[1:29:46] praise the lord amen
[1:29:52] he's challenging you
[1:29:57] takes your sleep away at 5 00 in the
[1:30:00] morning
[1:30:02] and see what you would do about it
[1:30:06] amen and you dash or under the blanket
[1:30:09] and you cover yourself and you close
[1:30:10] your eye tight
[1:30:12] but you can't sleep
[1:30:18] because he is the one that gives sleep
[1:30:29] praise the lord but when you re will you
[1:30:31] recognize and says
[1:30:32] lord i know you woke me up i know you
[1:30:35] are the one
[1:30:37] a guy will really enjoy my sleep just
[1:30:38] now
[1:30:46] we were there when i lay the foundation
[1:30:48] of the earth
[1:30:49] now as as you talk and in your real year
[1:30:53] god goes into different things i just
[1:30:55] talked i just took that
[1:30:56] their scripture on the treasure of the
[1:30:59] snow the treasure of the hill
[1:31:00] because i want to talk about treasure in
[1:31:03] a different way
[1:31:05] let's look at some few scriptures we
[1:31:07] will come back to our
[1:31:08] job year matthew chapter 6 verse 21.
[1:31:12] let's read matthew chapter 6 is is a
[1:31:15] familiar one
[1:31:17] where your treasure is
[1:31:20] there your heart will be is that what
[1:31:22] the scripture says
[1:31:24] amen if anyone have that down as a
[1:31:28] memory verse
[1:31:29] that you can go from this service and
[1:31:31] never forget it
[1:31:34] where your treasure is there your heart
[1:31:36] will be
[1:31:37] amen for where your treasure is there
[1:31:40] will your
[1:31:41] heart be also now you see the thing
[1:31:45] about it there is that
[1:31:46] when we think about treasure we
[1:31:49] think about what belongs to
[1:31:53] us what we are keeping
[1:31:57] what we hold so dear
[1:32:02] amen we don't want nobody to touch it
[1:32:06] the only thing in life i can be selfish
[1:32:08] about is my treasure
[1:32:11] that's my safe keeping that's that's the
[1:32:14] way we think about treasure
[1:32:16] let's read this other scripture also
[1:32:18] matthew 12 35.
[1:32:32] the scripture says a good man out
[1:32:36] of the good treasure of his heart bring
[1:32:40] her forth good things you need an
[1:32:44] evil man out of the evil treasure of his
[1:32:47] heart praise the lord
[1:32:50] now that jeremiah make us to know the
[1:32:53] heart of man
[1:32:54] before he's converted is is desperately
[1:32:56] wicked
[1:32:59] amen now so when you look at this
[1:33:03] where my mind is going where i want to
[1:33:06] grab our attention
[1:33:07] here is that i want us to look at
[1:33:10] treasure
[1:33:11] not in what we have or we stole
[1:33:15] but look at treasure in the sense of
[1:33:19] the things you treasure
[1:33:25] the things you treasure
[1:33:28] praise the lord amen
[1:33:32] i will give you an example genesis
[1:33:34] chapter 47
[1:33:36] let's go to genesis chapter 47 you will
[1:33:39] see the picture
[1:33:40] here this genesis chapter 47
[1:33:44] was worth
[1:33:49] joseph gift
[1:33:52] his gift brought
[1:33:56] egypt to this space amen
[1:34:00] his gift brought egypt to this place
[1:34:02] look at verse 13 the bible says
[1:34:05] and there was no bread in
[1:34:08] all the land for the farming was
[1:34:11] very sold saw the land of egypt and
[1:34:14] all the land of canaan fainted by
[1:34:17] reasons
[1:34:18] of the farming and joseph gather
[1:34:21] up all the money that was found in the
[1:34:25] land of egypt
[1:34:26] and in the land of canada for the con
[1:34:29] which they bought
[1:34:30] and joseph brought the money to
[1:34:32] pharaoh's house
[1:34:34] and and and when money fell
[1:34:37] in the land of egypt and in the land of
[1:34:39] canada all the egyptians came to joseph
[1:34:42] and and said give us bread for why
[1:34:45] should we
[1:34:46] die in that presence for
[1:34:49] the money failure we don't have money so
[1:34:51] why should we die jesus said okay god
[1:34:53] gave me your cattles
[1:34:55] they gave him his cattles when they were
[1:34:56] hungry again they came back to joseph
[1:34:58] and he says
[1:34:59] give us food why should we die because
[1:35:02] of cattle we don't have cattle okay give
[1:35:04] me your houses
[1:35:05] they give their houses when the money
[1:35:07] when when they are fulfilling they came
[1:35:08] back again
[1:35:09] and and they said why should we just say
[1:35:12] give me your lane
[1:35:13] and at the end of the story the bible
[1:35:17] says here that uh
[1:35:21] 26 verse 26 the scripture says
[1:35:26] and joseph made a lord over the land of
[1:35:29] egypt
[1:35:29] unto this day that pharaoh should have
[1:35:32] the fifth part
[1:35:33] except the land of of the priests on it
[1:35:37] which uh became
[1:35:40] nat's pharaoh but what happened here is
[1:35:43] that uh
[1:35:45] now pharaoh owned
[1:35:49] he owned the lane he owned the money
[1:35:53] he owned the katos he owned the houses
[1:35:56] and you also own the people
[1:36:02] praise the lord remember pharaoh is king
[1:36:07] what brought them to that place it was
[1:36:09] joseph wisdom
[1:36:10] and that is the very same place that
[1:36:12] christ's wisdom has brought us
[1:36:15] that everything we own our money in our
[1:36:18] house our life
[1:36:19] all belongs to him
[1:36:24] why did the people constantly came to
[1:36:26] joseph
[1:36:27] because his wisdom was a treasure
[1:36:34] his wisdom was a treasure
[1:36:38] when pharaoh couldn't even understand
[1:36:40] his own dream
[1:36:41] and joseph came and and reminded pharaoh
[1:36:44] of his dream
[1:36:45] and give him the interpretation that was
[1:36:48] the reason why
[1:36:49] pharaoh set him over everything
[1:36:53] because such a wisdom is a treasure
[1:37:01] so now egypt had a treasure why because
[1:37:04] they had a man
[1:37:05] in their mess that could speak
[1:37:10] just say okay you don't have money bring
[1:37:12] your katos
[1:37:13] okay come on let's go joseph said it
[1:37:16] it was they couldn't struggle over it
[1:37:18] why you and
[1:37:20] uh a hebrew trying to tell us to bring
[1:37:22] our cattles
[1:37:24] they knew that they wouldn't have been
[1:37:26] talking about seed
[1:37:28] or plain if joseph did not advise
[1:37:31] pharaoh
[1:37:32] did not interpret pharaoh's dream
[1:37:36] so the gift was a treasure
[1:37:40] the people was treasury in the gift
[1:37:45] praise the lord they were treasury in
[1:37:48] the gift
[1:37:49] and i believe by inspiration that's
[1:37:52] where god was bringing
[1:37:53] job
[1:37:57] amen
[1:38:00] where was you when i laid the foundation
[1:38:02] of the earth
[1:38:03] only little you know job
[1:38:06] there is a treasure treasure in me
[1:38:11] treasure ignoring me treasure ignoring
[1:38:14] that i have
[1:38:14] everything under control your treasure
[1:38:18] should not be what you have
[1:38:20] because what you have is limited what
[1:38:22] you know is limited
[1:38:24] some people treasure so much in their
[1:38:25] knowledge when they don't know nothing
[1:38:30] they put just few codes together and few
[1:38:33] structures that they just think that
[1:38:34] all the treasure in the world they know
[1:38:37] the word
[1:38:38] i was just thinking about that yesterday
[1:38:40] as i was driving
[1:38:42] i'm taking some reflex in my mind and i
[1:38:46] was saying my goodness
[1:38:50] have you ever preached
[1:38:54] at a place where you know you are
[1:38:56] preaching
[1:38:57] and you are saying lord jesus have mercy
[1:39:01] lord jesus because you can feed it
[1:39:05] you can feed it you can feel the
[1:39:08] resentment you can feed the rejection
[1:39:11] you can feed the evil forces that are
[1:39:13] gathering
[1:39:20] praise lord
[1:39:24] we do preach in a meeting
[1:39:28] where you are withstood by an evil
[1:39:30] spirit
[1:39:36] i remember one meeting there over in in
[1:39:39] togo
[1:39:41] and uh preaching along south broad delhi
[1:39:45] and larger feminine and
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:49] baker was the guest preacher so he had
[1:39:52] to go and preach
[1:39:53] at bert patrick's church in the evening
[1:39:55] so i had to take the evening service
[1:39:58] and uh
[1:40:02] and and that church is a solid church
[1:40:04] but you're going to church there in
[1:40:06] together it's a solid church
[1:40:09] but i mean to to preach
[1:40:18] and the holy spirit comes right behind
[1:40:20] the service
[1:40:24] with tongs interpretation picking up
[1:40:27] your message
[1:40:28] picking up things you had in your
[1:40:34] message
[1:40:36] those things are not only things that
[1:40:38] brother branham said those things are
[1:40:40] things
[1:40:40] that are happening among people
[1:40:46] the people are anxious to see it
[1:40:49] they are praying to see it they are
[1:40:51] living up to see it
[1:40:57] they come to church on time they wait on
[1:40:59] the lord they pray
[1:41:01] because they want to see god moving in
[1:41:03] their mess
[1:41:15] and yet some of the things that we have
[1:41:18] experienced and seen
[1:41:20] we counted nothing
[1:41:23] because they are men that has been there
[1:41:26] but egypt treasured
[1:41:29] the treasure they gave that joseph had
[1:41:32] in so much
[1:41:34] that everything they have they gave it
[1:41:36] to him
[1:41:38] everything they had their lane
[1:41:42] their their houses
[1:41:47] and and
[1:41:59] if you just read down i'm trying to find
[1:42:01] that scripture but the scripture
[1:42:03] shows here uh you know uh
[1:42:07] that the only place that pharaoh did
[1:42:09] neha was the land that belonged to the
[1:42:12] priests
[1:42:14] but pharaoh owned all of egypt and he
[1:42:17] owned the people
[1:42:20] that's what happened when we treasure
[1:42:23] in the one that we believe when we
[1:42:27] treasure
[1:42:28] in the one that we worship
[1:42:31] we don't hold back anything
[1:42:34] we don't hold back anything because you
[1:42:36] know
[1:42:38] my life belongs to god my money belongs
[1:42:40] to
[1:42:41] god my house belongs to god my family
[1:42:44] belongs to god
[1:42:52] there is a difference
[1:42:56] in having a treasure and what
[1:43:00] you treasure in
[1:43:04] praise the lord
[1:43:10] a good man out of the treasure of his
[1:43:13] heart
[1:43:14] that scripture sounds as what he's
[1:43:17] having in his heart no
[1:43:19] what it means a good man out of what his
[1:43:22] heart treasure
[1:43:23] after bring for good fruit
[1:43:29] it's what your heart is treasuring after
[1:43:34] because your heart is treasury after god
[1:43:38] i mean you you want to be a seven
[1:43:43] because you have to understand that
[1:43:45] there
[1:43:46] is proud that is in this nature i would
[1:43:49] just i would just reading that uh
[1:43:52] uh uh this morning i don't have it there

[1:44:08] sleep this morning i was just looking
[1:44:10] into a subject that was just so
[1:44:12] beautiful
[1:44:13] but let me share this with you brother
[1:44:14] brandon says yeah
[1:44:18] uh he says here he's talking about that
[1:44:22] that uh
[1:44:28] that's question in answer 1964 august
[1:44:31] 30th he says
[1:44:33] as long as you are in this life
[1:44:36] you are going to be sticky and have a
[1:44:40] kind of nature
[1:44:42] that's going to bother you as long as
[1:44:45] you
[1:44:46] live as long as you are in this
[1:44:50] life we don't preach
[1:44:54] sinless perfection
[1:44:57] our perfection is in christ
[1:45:03] you're going to have a sticky nature
[1:45:07] the era in your life you're going to be
[1:45:09] selfish
[1:45:14] there's a little blade of pride that
[1:45:16] will be sticking out
[1:45:19] you got to get the wheat and whip it off
[1:45:23] gotta wash this area
[1:45:26] stick it and have a kind of nature
[1:45:28] that's going to bother you
[1:45:30] as long as you live but
[1:45:33] inside of you you are born again
[1:45:38] inside of you you are born again your
[1:45:40] heart
[1:45:41] is treasuring to be like jesus
[1:45:46] your heart is treasuring to overcome
[1:45:48] these things
[1:45:50] but they are sticking on your flesh
[1:45:54] praise the lord are we together so there
[1:45:58] is a difference
[1:46:00] there is a difference of the treasure
[1:46:02] that we have to
[1:46:03] ourself everything that we have as
[1:46:07] treasure is in him
[1:46:10] our treasure is in him
[1:46:13] amen
[1:46:16] praise the lord we treasured in him
[1:46:21] and that's where god was trying to bring
[1:46:23] job
[1:46:24] do you know the treasure of the snow
[1:46:28] not to give him all the scientific proof
[1:46:30] but to let him to know
[1:46:32] there is a treasure that's a wisdom
[1:46:35] beyond what all you know
[1:46:39] there's a wisdom and to know
[1:46:42] that there is wisdom above our wisdom it
[1:46:45] makes us to treasure
[1:46:46] in the one that we believe it
[1:46:51] our treasure is in him
[1:46:55] not in ourselves not in a certain pastor
[1:46:58] or minister
[1:46:59] our treasure is in christ
[1:47:05] that's the one our heart long where your
[1:47:07] treasure is
[1:47:08] there your heart will be your heart long
[1:47:11] for more of him for more of him
[1:47:17] think about it where your treasure is
[1:47:19] there your heart will be
[1:47:22] amen praise the lord he said oh my
[1:47:25] treasure is in heaven
[1:47:26] heaven is consists of the word that's
[1:47:28] what the prophet said
[1:47:30] heaven is consists of the word
[1:47:35] so where your treasure is my treasure is
[1:47:38] in this word
[1:47:40] my treasure is in the wisdom that comes
[1:47:42] from this word
[1:47:43] the advice that comes from this word the
[1:47:46] counsel that comes from this word
[1:47:47] the rebuke that comes from this world my
[1:47:50] treasure is in it
[1:47:53] that's the reason why we take the
[1:47:55] council of the word gladly to our heart

[1:50:45] that was how much the treasure in his
[1:50:50] wisdom
[1:50:54] praise the lord amen
[1:50:58] and this is the very solomon that
[1:51:01] teaches

[1:51:05] is the beginning of wisdom
[1:51:09] you know what he means the fear of the
[1:51:12] lord

[1:51:16] into his treasure
[1:51:20] when you start referencing god you are
[1:51:22] entering into his treasure

[1:55:15] that he was playing out christ
[1:55:25] are we together look at paul here he
[1:55:28] says
[1:55:30] corinthians 8 that we just read we know
[1:55:33] the idols are abomination
[1:55:37] he says but let's think about this
[1:55:40] because knowledge quits to puff up
[1:55:44] knowledge quick to judge
[1:55:48] but think about this from the very
[1:55:51] act that drove david from the throne
[1:55:57] that from the very eye that drove him
[1:55:58] from the throne
[1:56:00] will become a son
[1:56:04] now you yeah you and myself josh that
[1:56:06] matter
[1:56:09] that's what solomon was never
[1:56:12] israel favorite he was not israel
[1:56:16] february until he rise to the throne
[1:56:18] israel favorite
[1:56:22] what's who absalom the god with the afro
[1:56:27] the bible said he was a huge man he was
[1:56:29] a hamson guy
[1:56:32] that was israel favorite why because
[1:56:34] they were georgian solomon by his birth
[1:56:40] their knowledge puff up until they was
[1:56:43] rejecting this man
[1:56:49] the treasure that is in wisdom
[1:56:54] the treasure that is in wisdom
[1:56:59] and like i said all the time wisdom is
[1:57:02] just the right use of knowledge
[1:57:07] it's just the right use of knowledge you
[1:57:09] can have all the knowledge of the word
[1:57:11] if you don't use it rightly
[1:57:15] then you have a wisdom that is not from
[1:57:17] above because james brought us to that
[1:57:20] place of wisdom from above and wisdom
[1:57:21] from beneath
[1:57:25] the wisdom from beneath have got us into
[1:57:26] all of this that we aim
[1:57:32] that's the treasure that's what god
[1:57:36] talked he all he also asks
[1:57:37] he also asks her a job what do you think
[1:57:40] about the astra
[1:57:43] when she lay her eggs she buried them in
[1:57:46] the earth she don't even know where she
[1:57:47] buried him
[1:57:51] praise the lord you will think in your
[1:57:53] human mind
[1:57:54] that it's a careless animal she don't
[1:57:56] even know where she bury her young's
[1:57:59] praise the lord but you think about it
[1:58:02] she digs the earth put her eggs there
[1:58:05] and cover it to make it warm
[1:58:09] to create a temperature
[1:58:13] praise the lord
[1:58:19] he says you might think that the astra
[1:58:21] is dumb
[1:58:22] once you do that but i will also tell
[1:58:24] you that even a hearse
[1:58:26] cannot run onto an oscar that's why he
[1:58:29] told you all
[1:58:34] the treasure there is treasure
[1:58:38] in everything that god created
[1:58:41] there is just abundance of treasure that
[1:58:44] is hidden behind it
[1:58:49] abundance of wisdom
[1:58:53] that is hidden behind
[1:58:56] the hair on our head why he gave it to
[1:58:58] us
[1:59:00] praise the lord just just summing the
[1:59:04] hair on your body there is just a lot of
[1:59:06] wisdom
[1:59:09] that he puts into death
[1:59:15] that even signs in all their research
[1:59:18] will never come close they will never
[1:59:22] come close
[1:59:25] so that's what he's bringing job now now
[1:59:28] watch here
[1:59:29] he did not he did not condemn job
[1:59:34] no he didn't condemn job he only told
[1:59:37] job there
[1:59:38] all you are saying is right but there is
[1:59:40] another part that you don't know about
[1:59:49] now the people he condemned were the
[1:59:51] friends of job
[1:59:53] because they were not speaking on god's
[1:59:55] behalf
[1:59:57] because they thought that they knew
[2:00:00] they thought that they knew why job was
[2:00:02] suffering because you are a secret
[2:00:04] sinner
[2:00:04] because you are hiding things in your
[2:00:06] life you've been wicked you've been
[2:00:08] selfish they're in their mind
[2:00:10] they're all ordered you so god said you
[2:00:13] never spoke for
[2:00:14] on my behalf you better go let joe pray
[2:00:16] for you
[2:00:19] praise the lord you are not speaking on
[2:00:22] my behalf
[2:00:23] when you come condemning god's people
[2:00:26] when you come trying to make god's
[2:00:29] people
[2:00:29] to go back to walk off of the blood that
[2:00:32] has redeemed him
[2:00:36] you're not speaking on god's behalf
[2:00:39] because the work of god he didn't put it
[2:00:42] in the hands of any man
[2:00:45] he has power enough to transform the
[2:00:47] life of his people
[2:00:49] he might keep them in a moment he might
[2:00:51] be building characters in their life
[2:00:53] there are things that might be going on
[2:00:54] that you don't have no
[2:00:56] idea about
[2:01:00] that you don't have no idea about don't
[2:01:03] use your canary brain
[2:01:05] on god predestinate a seed
[2:01:12] don't use your selfish judgment
[2:01:19] and you know what it does to us when we
[2:01:22] realize that
[2:01:24] beyond all our mistakes and our failures
[2:01:29] our shortcomings there's a great wisdom
[2:01:31] that we don't understand
[2:01:33] and make us to fall to our knees
[2:01:37] and cry and cry
[2:01:41] they don't make you proud and you start
[2:01:43] to argue and defend yourself
[2:01:48] you are just as foolish as your sin is
[2:01:50] foolish
[2:01:51] when you start to defend yourself in
[2:01:53] your wrong
[2:01:57] to realize that god
[2:02:00] in his mercy when you are afraid
[2:02:04] to be caught by men you cannot run from
[2:02:06] the eyes of god
[2:02:08] because his eyes run the torah for
[2:02:09] through the earth
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:12] you cannot be more swifter than the eyes
[2:02:14] of god
[2:02:16] he knows your thoughts he knows the
[2:02:17] intents of your heart
[2:02:24] but yet in all of that he looks beyonce
[2:02:28] your fault and he extend mercy to you
[2:02:33] you look beyond your rebellious heart
[2:02:36] and stay esteemed mercy to you
[2:02:38] and then you think you are justified in
[2:02:40] your ways
[2:02:43] just thinking about that must bring us
[2:02:45] to our knees
[2:02:47] and cry and say lord who am i that you
[2:02:50] are bestowed such a love upon
[2:02:54] what's the wisdom that is hidden behind
[2:02:56] my life that you just can't let me go
[2:03:07] that's what god was bringing job
[2:03:11] where were you when i lay the foundation
[2:03:14] of the earth
[2:03:17] but god identified somebody that was
[2:03:19] with him
[2:03:21] who was that wisdom he said for she was
[2:03:24] with me
[2:03:29] she was with me when i formed the heaven
[2:03:31] and the earth
[2:03:35] glory be to god
[2:03:39] glory be to god
[2:03:43] this age where we can pull everything on
[2:03:45] on google
[2:03:47] we can ask google for questions praise
[2:03:50] the lord
[2:03:56] google don't have the wisdom of god
[2:04:05] that's the greatest gift first
[2:04:08] corinthians chapter one
[2:04:09] let me close here it's one o'clock amen
[2:04:14] first corinthians chapter one
[2:04:24] first corinthians chapter one let's read
[2:04:26] verse teddy
[2:04:29] you think about that think about that
[2:04:33] people think about that
[2:04:38] wisdom is the feminine part of god
[2:04:45] and we know the feminine path is a
[2:04:47] weaker vessel
[2:04:48] that's what is despised it looks so
[2:04:52] common
[2:04:55] praise the lord that's why it looks like
[2:04:57] foolishness to this word
[2:05:00] because it's the feminine part of god
[2:05:05] but yet it has strength
[2:05:10] amen it has strength it gives life
[2:05:14] it's wisdom that bears life it's the
[2:05:17] woman that bears
[2:05:18] life
[2:05:21] the man in all of his muscles he does
[2:05:24] not have an
[2:05:25] idea of what nine months period take he
[2:05:28] don't have an
[2:05:29] idea of it he don't have an idea you are
[2:05:33] not built that way
[2:05:36] it's wisdom that conceives seed
[2:05:40] for god
[2:05:43] it has it it's wisdom
[2:05:47] that dead all the trials and go
[2:05:50] through the different stages
[2:06:00] if a man thinketh that he knows
[2:06:07] first corinthians 1 verse 30
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:14] praise the lord amen
[2:06:19] but of him i hear
[2:06:22] in christ jesus who
[2:06:25] of god is made unto us
[2:06:29] wisdom
[2:06:34] but of him i ye in christ
[2:06:37] jesus will of god
[2:06:43] the very breath of christ was the wisdom
[2:06:46] of god
[2:06:49] because when he said a virgin shall
[2:06:50] conceive
[2:06:52] that tribes could not understand it
[2:06:54] everybody had their interpretation
[2:06:56] when he said the virgin shall conceive
[2:06:58] it went 700 years
[2:07:02] he never gave a time he never put did to
[2:07:04] it that's why i said
[2:07:05] don't put god on your calendar because
[2:07:08] god is out of time
[2:07:11] he's the one that determined times you
[2:07:14] don't put god on your calendar
[2:07:16] that's been rude god you must do this
[2:07:18] for me and god and this this by this
[2:07:21] time
[2:07:21] by this time before i get to this time
[2:07:25] in my life
[2:07:26] i've just been arrogant
[2:07:31] i've just been arrogant
[2:07:35] because maybe it is the time that god is
[2:07:37] just starting with you
[2:07:40] at a time where you think you're ready
[2:07:41] i'm ready now to move on my own
[2:07:46] god said this won't just want to kill
[2:07:48] himself
[2:07:49] have a message i gotta do something to
[2:07:51] hold this boy
[2:07:59] don't put god on your time calendar
[2:08:03] because god is out of time
[2:08:07] he's out of time
[2:08:13] but it's time in my life i want to be
[2:08:14] here but it's time in my life i want to
[2:08:16] be here
[2:08:17] jim says try and say by the grace of god
[2:08:23] he said try and say god by your grace
[2:08:31] because there is just a lot of wisdom
[2:08:37] the field of the lord is the key
[2:08:41] it's the key to go into the treasure of
[2:08:48] wisdom
[2:08:50] i just feel like preaching this now that
[2:08:52] i've started
[2:08:54] when i don't have time it's now that the
[2:08:57] inspiration has broke open
[2:09:01] oh my goodness me is that my wife saying
[2:09:04] that
[2:09:06] praise the lord amen
[2:09:12] christ christ woe
[2:09:15] of god is made wisdom for us
[2:09:19] it's made wisdom that's the reason why
[2:09:22] he is our treasure
[2:09:26] he's the one where my treasure is
[2:09:30] that way my heart was sick my treasure
[2:09:33] is in him
[2:09:38] because he was made wisdom for us my
[2:09:41] treasure is in him
[2:09:46] just like the gift of joseph brought the
[2:09:49] entire land of egypt
[2:09:52] that's how christ brought us
[2:09:57] to give him our house give me i gave you
[2:09:59] my house
[2:10:00] i give you my everything because you are
[2:10:04] a safe treasure
[2:10:07] and when the people did there read the
[2:10:09] story when the people did there
[2:10:11] they could come to joseph at any time of
[2:10:13] the year for corn
[2:10:15] he would give them corn to go and planet
[2:10:16] because everything they have belonged
[2:10:18] back to the storehouse
[2:10:22] everything they had belonged back to the
[2:10:26] treasure
[2:10:28] and that's what god was telling job
[2:10:33] you want to see the snow job but do you
[2:10:37] know
[2:10:37] the treasure of the snow do you know the
[2:10:41] wisdom
[2:10:42] why i allow snow to fall
[2:10:48] do you know that the mind that is behind
[2:10:50] that
[2:10:52] you are just looking at pressing live
[2:10:54] and what your eyes can see what your
[2:10:56] body can feel what your ear can hear
[2:11:02] you are not wrong job
[2:11:06] but there is more and that's where he
[2:11:09] came up with this
[2:11:10] statement when job replied to god
[2:11:14] the bible says he said this let's read
[2:11:16] that and then we close
[2:11:18] praise the lord
[2:11:21] praise the lord i hate to close when
[2:11:24] it's getting so good
[2:11:26] but let's just read it and we were close
[2:11:31] amen
[2:11:34] job chapter 42 then job answered the
[2:11:37] lord and said i know
[2:11:39] that thou can do everything
[2:11:42] and that no thoughts can be withholding
[2:11:46] from thee
[2:11:47] no touch you know all i was thinking
[2:11:52] when god came down and just and just
[2:11:54] challenged job
[2:11:57] you are talking with darkness wisdom no
[2:12:00] counsel your speech are dark
[2:12:04] you have just a little bit of light is
[2:12:06] what you see
[2:12:10] he says i know no touch is here from
[2:12:14] thee
[2:12:15] and i can tell you this morning he knows
[2:12:18] every thought
[2:12:19] that is running through your mind now
[2:12:23] he knows what you're thinking on don't
[2:12:25] change your talk
[2:12:27] don't change your mind
[2:12:35] trying to adjust your thought and be
[2:12:36] spiritual no no no no
[2:12:38] keep your mind to where he is he just
[2:12:40] caught you
[2:12:45] you know i can't play spiritual
[2:12:49] and no thought can be withholding from
[2:12:51] thee
[2:12:53] who is he that have counsel
[2:12:56] without knowledge wherefore have i
[2:13:00] altered that i understood
[2:13:03] not
[2:13:07] i alter what are honors to not

[2:13:16] tie your tongue
[2:13:21] hold it within don't look for words
[2:13:24] seek god's mercy
[2:13:28] because if you don't do that you will
[2:13:30] start altering
[2:13:32] words that you will have to come back
[2:13:34] and repent
[2:13:40] which of course that's the thing that is
[2:13:42] difficult because we will come back with
[2:13:43] defensive you know

[2:14:25] the balls on his king now he starts to
[2:14:28] see them
[2:14:29] being too wonderful oh my goodness
[2:14:34] being too wonderful because god is
[2:14:36] showing there's a treasure
[2:14:38] that's this wisdom that is hidden behind
[2:14:40] the breaking up of your skin
[2:14:45] it tastes so wonderful for me oh my god
