[43:39] have heard his voice speaking of blind
[43:41] Bartimaeus he was a hundred or two
[43:43] hundred yards from him and people were
[43:46] screaming and he wasn't listening to
[43:48] them they was fussing at him but he was
[43:50] thinking of Jerusalem think about that
[43:53] brother Graham said Jesus is walking
[43:55] through the town there's people
[43:57] hollering at him there's people fussing
[43:59] at him but he's not paying them no
[44:01] attention because he was thinking of
[44:03] Jerusalem he said but that blind
[44:06] Beggar's Faith stopped him and he turned
[44:09] what's going on he said bring him here
[44:11] what was taken place the insignificant
[44:14] beggar stopped Jesus on his road to
[44:18] Jerusalem the insignificant Beggars
[44:21] stopped Jesus on his road to Jerusalem
[44:24] he said your faith can do the same thing
[44:28] tonight and remember amen then in other
[44:30] words the faith of Bartimaeus is not
[44:33] dead amen it changed so put it back
[44:35] where it was if you can the faith of
[44:37] Bartimaeus was not dead it's still alive
[44:39] here tonight see your faith can do the
[44:42] same thing tonight he turned around and
[44:45] he began to look and said bring him here
[44:47] he said what was happening God had
[44:50] provided a lamb for blind bartimaeus's
[44:53] eyes and that same lamb is provided
[44:55] tonight for every person here and
[44:58] everywhere he's passing by let your
[45:02] faith stop him think about that that
[45:04] Jesus the son of God the word made flesh
[45:07] the word manifested was in route to
[45:10] Jerusalem but there was an insignificant
[45:13] beggar who was sitting by the highway
[45:15] side he did not have money
[45:18] right he did not have popularity he did
[45:22] not have Fame to the world he was a
[45:24] nobody amen but there was something only
[45:27] inside of him that had enough power to
[45:30] stop Jesus in his tracks and turn around
[45:32] and say bring him here now we know that
[45:35] the Bible says that faith is the
[45:37] substance of things hoped for amen it is
[45:40] the evidence of Things Not Seen amen for
[45:43] by it Elders obtained a good report and
[45:46] through faith we understand that the
[45:48] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[45:50] that things which are seen were not made
[45:52] of things which to appear the prophet
[45:54] says I'm going to teach a little bit
[45:56] about faith that's what we all need a
[45:58] whole lot of this and if faith is not an
[46:01] Evidence it is only of substance he said
[46:04] Faith itself is a substance and an
[46:06] Evidence of things that the senses of
[46:08] the body will not declare I thought
[46:11] maybe in teaching this it would spur
[46:13] your faith up Amen to get it to a level
[46:15] where God can move into you amen and can
[46:18] bless you so the prophet was not saying
[46:21] we need more education we need more
[46:23] intellectualism we need more religion
[46:25] he's saying what the church needs is
[46:27] more faith that it could actually raise
[46:29] to a level that God could come into the
[46:32] church and he could bless the church and
[46:34] God blesses the church through faith now
[46:36] I don't know about you but I don't
[46:38] believe that we're here amen just
[46:40] Desiring to be church members I don't
[46:42] believe her here just Desiring to say we
[46:44] follow a message or we believe that God
[46:46] is sent a prophet amen but the prophet
[46:48] identified that in the end time in the
[46:50] heart of the Bride that there would be a
[46:52] hunger and he would call it for
[46:54] Apostolic times he said we see this
[46:56] morning he's been trying to get their
[46:58] Church into the place where we can
[46:59] really see amen Apostolic times moving
[47:03] Among Us that's what we all hunger for
[47:05] it's just laying right at the door we
[47:08] see it but we want to see more of it
[47:10] amen we wanted such a flow that it'll be
[47:12] a help to us that it'll flow out to
[47:14] others so in other words he was saying
[47:16] in the last days there is going to to be
[47:19] a bride who is going to be hungry and
[47:21] she's going to be thirsty for Apostolic
[47:23] times amen that she would actually be a
[47:26] channel amen that when God would pour
[47:28] out his spirit amen he could pour His
[47:30] Spirit into her amen which would Quicken
[47:33] a gene seed on the inside of her soul
[47:35] and that were caused out of her amen
[47:38] would flow more Apostolic times now when
[47:40] you start talking about faith you
[47:42] realize amen that people that have faith
[47:44] has experienced
[47:46] people that have faith has experience
[47:49] and the prophet of God says experience
[47:51] brings Faith amen people that have faith
[47:54] have experience and experience brings
[47:57] Faith now you all know the prophet of
[47:59] God teaches us that people will actually
[48:01] save amen that scene is believing he
[48:04] said but it doesn't work because a man
[48:06] can sit and look right straight at
[48:08] anything and they'll not see it because
[48:10] the word see the word English see has so
[48:12] many different meanings she might be a
[48:15] body of water it might mean to
[48:17] understand it might mean to look at oh
[48:19] there's just all kinds of words you can
[48:21] use but when you say sin is believing
[48:24] you are mistaken
[48:26] can you say Amen but when you understand
[48:28] it you believe it when you understand it
[48:31] you believe it Jesus said except a man
[48:33] be born again he cannot see the kingdom
[48:36] in other words understand the kingdom
[48:38] because the kingdom is the holy spirit
[48:40] in you amen thank you brother that's
[48:42] perfect the kingdom of the holy spirit
[48:44] amen is in you so you have to understand
[48:47] what this is in you so in other words
[48:49] you've got to understand what this is
[48:52] that's in you do you realize inside
[48:54] every person here tonight there is
[48:56] something inside every person because
[48:58] you are a habitation you are a Dwelling
[49:01] Place you you are a place that has been
[49:03] created Amen to habitate something you
[49:05] are a place that has been created Amen
[49:07] to hold something so you've got to
[49:09] understand amen what that is in you and
[49:13] the only way you'll understand it is to
[49:15] compare it amen with what it makes you
[49:17] do with what the Bible said it would
[49:18] make you do amen then your problem is
[49:21] solved amen he is that holy spirit amen
[49:24] if you've got doubt in you been down
[49:26] without the word but if you got faith in
[49:29] you Amen to faith in you will actually
[49:31] make you believe the word when
[49:33] everything else is given you reason to
[49:35] doubt the word I'm on Church you're not
[49:37] sitting here that's a bunch of doubters
[49:39] tonight amen you're not sitting here
[49:41] it's a bunch of church members amen but
[49:43] you are here amen as the habitation of
[49:45] God and it's been created under good
[49:48] works under Christ Jesus you are here as
[49:50] the bride amen I'll tell you what a
[49:52] prophet said you are he said you are a
[49:54] little faith woman amen you are a little
[49:57] faith woman you're not a great big
[49:59] Polish amen fancy religion denomination
[50:01] amen but you're a little faith woman
[50:03] amen I'm just going to go ahead and
[50:05] preach if that's okay you are the place
[50:07] amen that the faith of God has returned
[50:10] to in these last days
[50:12] that's right the faith of God is not in
[50:15] a tomb in Jerusalem the faith of God is
[50:18] Not on a throne in a Corporal body in
[50:21] heaven tonight amen but according to the
[50:23] word of the Lord the faith of God is in
[50:25] the Bride of Jesus Christ and Faith must
[50:28] have a resting place now the prophet
[50:30] said anything that's contrary to the
[50:31] word of God Amen faith in God can have
[50:34] no resting place unless it's a promise
[50:37] of God he said there it takes its
[50:39] Eternal stand amen faith is the
[50:42] foundation of all things you know that
[50:44] in the book of Peter amen second Peter
[50:46] that Peter will actually outline what is
[50:48] called the stature of a perfect man the
[50:51] prophet of God comes along and says
[50:53] those are seven virtues that will be
[50:56] manifested after a new birth in the life
[50:58] of the Bride of Jesus Christ and the
[51:01] very first virtue the very foundation of
[51:03] the Pyramid of the stature of a perfect
[51:06] man was not feelings it was not
[51:08] Sensational it was not emotion but the
[51:11] foundation of the pyramid head of the
[51:13] stature of a perfect man was Faith oh my
[51:17] the promise that when you're born again
[51:18] you can't be born again without having
[51:21] faith so you see on my chart here I've
[51:23] got the very Foundation faith is the
[51:26] foundation of all of it so faith is the
[51:28] foundation of virtue it's the foundation
[51:31] of knowledge it's the foundation of
[51:33] temperance it's the foundation of
[51:35] patience it's the foundation of
[51:37] Brotherly kindness amen listen faith is
[51:39] the foundation of the headstone which is
[51:42] Charity which is God himself I'm on
[51:44] Church you're not going to make it out
[51:45] of laodicea it's just an education
[51:47] you're not gonna make it out of
[51:49] tribulation at this world that we're
[51:51] living in with just an idea about God
[51:53] Amen but in the end time amen God will
[51:56] restore the faith of God to the Church
[51:58] of God and would put her back up on the
[52:00] same rock that Moses stood upon put her
[52:03] back up on the same rock that David
[52:04] stood upon I'm on Church you're not
[52:06] built upon feelings you're not built on
[52:08] sensation you're not built on the way
[52:10] things are going you are built upon
[52:13] Faith
[52:15] [Music]
[52:16] you are built upon faith faith is the
[52:19] foundation of all of it for without
[52:21] faith it is impossible to please God for
[52:24] he that cometh to God must believe that
[52:25] he is and must believe that he is a
[52:27] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[52:29] Him and when you're a skeptic of the
[52:31] Bible amen you're a skeptic of the word
[52:33] being right you might as well stay back
[52:35] until first you believe in he said what
[52:37] is sin sin is unbelief there's only two
[52:40] elements that control the human being
[52:42] that's either doubt or faith are you in
[52:44] me two elements control the human being
[52:46] you are a human being all right can we
[52:48] agree there you're a human you're not an
[52:51] angel you'll never be an angel you never
[52:53] was born to be an angel maybe contrary
[52:55] to what you believe you're not an angel
[52:58] are you hearing me you're a human being
[53:00] so you're either possessed by faith or
[53:02] doubt he said see one of those dominates
[53:05] your life so it just depends on how much
[53:07] Faith you can have is how high you can
[53:10] rise in other words we're not starting
[53:12] at the top and going down but we're
[53:14] starting at the bottom and going up amen
[53:17] are you hearing me the restoration of
[53:18] the Bride tree how did it die it died by
[53:21] them eating it down how did God restore
[53:23] it by them coming back up come on Church
[53:25] the pyramid it didn't start with the
[53:27] Capstone it started with the foundation
[53:29] stone and God would send a prophet to
[53:32] identify that Romans then I've chaptered
[53:34] behold I lay inside a Cornerstone a
[53:37] chief Stone amen a foundation stone he
[53:40] would identify that the foundation stone
[53:42] is The Headstone is the Cornerstone it's
[53:45] the stone that the builders rejected
[53:47] it's the stone that is returned to the
[53:49] church in the last days that we would
[53:51] have a sure Foundation I mean we're not
[53:53] sitting here on shifting Sands of man's
[53:55] ideas we are standing up on
[53:58] Eternal Word of almighty God and heavens
[54:00] and earth can pass away but my words
[54:03] shall never pass away come on there's
[54:04] people sitting right here tonight that
[54:06] can no more fall than God can there's
[54:08] people sitting right here tonight they
[54:10] can no more die than God can die because
[54:12] God through a prophet let's put your
[54:14] feet up on the Rock and it's a rock of
[54:17] Revelation it's a rock it's not the
[54:19] rockage of altar it's a Rock of Ages and
[54:21] it was shoot out of a mountain and it
[54:24] come rolling down into the Gentile
[54:25] kingdoms and crushed them because it's
[54:27] not a man's Stone it's Jesus Christ the
[54:31] son of the Living God we are not here
[54:33] dominated by doubts we are not here
[54:35] dominated by feelings we are here
[54:37] dominated by faith
[54:39] and faith has made it possible to please
[54:42] God I love what Paul says in Hebrews 11
[54:44] 6 without faith it is impossible to
[54:47] please him for he that cometh to God
[54:49] must believe that he is
[54:51] that's right he that cometh to God must
[54:54] believe that he is is what is God
[54:58] can I preach a minute must believe that
[55:00] he is is what he is God Amen amen and
[55:03] that he is a rewarder of them that
[55:05] dilatilly seek him now this is just
[55:08] Bible commentary not of authority so
[55:09] take her leave it but in Hebrews 11 Paul
[55:12] says amen 15 times that it's by faith
[55:15] now listen by faith is meant a living
[55:18] active faith it is a faith that knows
[55:21] and follows God it communes and
[55:23] fellowships with God it does not matter
[55:25] what a person does without faith he
[55:28] cannot please God are you hearing me I I
[55:31] I I I preface that statement I made it's
[55:35] Bible commentary you can take it or you
[55:37] can leave it somebody said why you say
[55:38] that because it's a Bible commentator so
[55:40] if you don't want to believe it I don't
[55:41] have to say you got to believe it but if
[55:43] it's something brother say to you all to
[55:44] believe it
[55:45] that's Vindicated word that's
[55:47] commentators is that okay no matter what
[55:49] a person does without faith he cannot
[55:51] please God without faith a person has to
[55:54] plow to this life all alone and handle
[55:56] all the trials Temptation sufferings
[55:58] accidents diseases and death by himself
[56:01] without faith a person stands all alone
[56:03] in this world utterly without God it is
[56:06] impossible for him to please God so God
[56:09] never did intend for his word to be
[56:11] accepted by intellectualism he extended
[56:14] for his word to be accepted by faith
[56:16] neither did he intend for his word he
[56:19] meant to be hidden in the mind but he
[56:21] intended for his word to be hidden in
[56:23] the heart that's why the prophet of God
[56:25] preaches believe from the hearts and not
[56:28] from the head he did not say belief from
[56:31] the head he said believe from the heart
[56:34] now what does Proverbs 23 7 say as he
[56:37] thinketh in his heart so is he David
[56:39] says in Psalms 119 11 Thy word have I
[56:42] hid in my heart that I might not sin
[56:45] against these in Romans the 10th chapter
[56:47] Paul says for with the heart man
[56:49] believeth unto righteousness and with
[56:52] the mouth confession is made into
[56:53] salvation now you say why are you saying
[56:56] that about intellectualism because I
[56:58] said like this we've had enough
[56:59] intellectual Gatherings
[57:01] we've had enough intellectual sermons
[57:04] we've had enough intellectual
[57:05] conventions the prophet of God shows you
[57:07] that intellectual Gatherings amen have
[57:10] produced intellectual understandings
[57:12] which have produced total failures you
[57:14] get somebody gathered by intellect you
[57:16] get somebody understanding my intellect
[57:18] amen the first trial that comes our way
[57:21] that they can't see their way through it
[57:22] they can't feel their way through it
[57:24] they can't smell their way through it
[57:26] they can't hear their way through it I'm
[57:27] on Church they'll say well there's no
[57:29] way I can get through it amen that's
[57:31] because you accepted the word into an
[57:33] intellectual realm but if you accepted
[57:36] it by faith into the heart you will
[57:38] stand there like a puppet saying and
[57:40] said I can't see my way around it I
[57:42] can't see my way above it I can't see my
[57:44] way under it but God will make a way and
[57:47] I will go through it have you forgot
[57:49] that for God you're servant is still a
[57:51] way maker have you forgot to forgot your
[57:54] servant it's the one that opened the Red
[57:56] Sea he's the one that closed the mouth
[57:58] of the Lions he's the one that broke the
[58:00] wall so Jericho down he is the one I'm
[58:03] in this shop of power in the fiery
[58:05] furnace amen from burning Shadrach
[58:07] Meshach and it Bendigo and that same God
[58:09] has returned in this last day to the
[58:12] message of the hour to the heart of the
[58:14] believer to announce unto her this is
[58:16] not a man's Faith this is not a Church's
[58:18] Faith this is the restoration of the
[58:21] Divine faith of almighty God
[58:23] what are you saying I'm saying we're not
[58:25] about to intellectual chickens we're not
[58:27] a bunch of intellectual chickens we're
[58:29] word born Eagles
[58:31] [Music]
[58:34] Trevor shall send this mountain be thou
[58:37] removed and cast in the sea and shall
[58:39] not doubt in his head is that what it
[58:40] says no it says shall not doubt in his
[58:43] heart amen but Shall Believe those
[58:45] things which he saith shall come to pass
[58:48] he shall have whatsoever he saith right
[58:51] there Jesus has just spoke what Paul is
[58:53] going to preach in Romans 10 that the
[58:56] heart believeth unto righteousness and
[58:58] the mouth confesseth unto salvation
[59:00] alone Church there is a connection
[59:01] between what is in your heart and what
[59:04] comes out of your mouth are you hearing
[59:06] me there's a Divine connection between
[59:08] what is in your heart and what comes out
[59:11] of your mouth my Bible says guard that
[59:13] heart because out of that Hearts will
[59:15] come the issues of life and if you've
[59:17] got a bunch of negativity in your heart
[59:19] your mouth's going to confess a bunch of
[59:20] negativity but if you give a word in
[59:23] your heart then no matter how bad it is
[59:25] how cold it is how dark it is how hard
[59:27] it is if the word is in your heart you
[59:30] will confess the word regardless of the
[59:32] condition you will confess the word
[59:33] regardless of the center situation
[59:35] because your heart has been guarded by
[59:38] the Holy Ghost
[59:40] he's saying I'm saying it's time to stop
[59:41] talking negative
[59:44] right I'm saying it's time to stop
[59:45] talking negative Amen brother Joe
[59:47] foreign
[59:49] poor pitiful me amen I didn't come to
[59:52] tell you poor pitiful you I come to tell
[59:54] you greater is he
[59:56] that is in you
[59:58] it's in the world I come to tell you
[1:00:00] that before you was a sinner you was a
[1:00:01] son I come to tell you you're not
[1:00:04] following a man you're following God I
[1:00:06] come to tell you that it's God before
[1:00:08] you and who can be again I come to
[1:00:11] tell you go with house and follow my
[1:00:12] left side and a thousand following my
[1:00:14] right side they shall not come now thee
[1:00:17] are you hearing me guard that heart
[1:00:19] because out of that heart it's where the
[1:00:22] mouse vocabulary is going to come from
[1:00:24] don't doubt in your heart and he won't
[1:00:26] doubt in your lips
[1:00:28] that's preaching right there I thought
[1:00:30] that's pretty good for a country boy
[1:00:32] don't doubt in your heart and you won't
[1:00:33] doubt in your lips I'm on now you can't
[1:00:36] have it not in your heart oh you may
[1:00:38] fake it for a while but what's really in
[1:00:40] your heart is going to come across your
[1:00:41] lips
[1:00:42] that's right oh my it's true he said
[1:00:46] well there could be a place in he said
[1:00:47] now it seems like upon thinking those
[1:00:49] things that there could actually be a
[1:00:50] place and by reading the word of faith
[1:00:52] that would go beyond the intellectual
[1:00:54] conceptions Into the Heart for Jesus
[1:00:56] said if Thou shalt say in thy heart now
[1:00:58] we get all frustrated in our minds we go
[1:01:01] out and say oh I've seen that done yet I
[1:01:02] oh once in a while just hop skip and so
[1:01:04] forth but it seems like it just can't
[1:01:06] get moving right it's because we tried
[1:01:09] to mix the intellectual with the
[1:01:11] supernatural
[1:01:13] so we tried to mix the intellectual with
[1:01:16] the supernatural they have no dealings
[1:01:19] with each other at all intellectuals
[1:01:21] will say one thing Supernatural will say
[1:01:24] another and any man listen that's ever
[1:01:26] led by the spirit of God does not take
[1:01:29] any fault of any intellectual but is Led
[1:01:32] from his heart by the spirit of God he's
[1:01:35] led by the spirit of God from his heart
[1:01:39] so in other words the Holy Ghost has
[1:01:42] taken residency up on the control tower
[1:01:44] of the heart of that individual he is no
[1:01:47] longer led by what he sees he is no
[1:01:50] longer led by what he thinks he's no
[1:01:52] longer led by the way he feels but he
[1:01:54] has stepped out of the realm of human
[1:01:55] leadership under the auspices of divine
[1:01:58] leadership and he is being led by the
[1:02:00] son of man come on Church you want to
[1:02:03] show it to you in the word the prophet
[1:02:04] of God said he was over in Memphis right
[1:02:06] you say well I thought you said from the
[1:02:08] word I am in the word he was over in
[1:02:10] Memphis and he said I was going to mail
[1:02:12] some cards and go back to the hotel or
[1:02:15] to the hotel to go the airport he said
[1:02:17] see but there was a woman down there are
[1:02:20] you hearing me there was a one are you
[1:02:22] are you hearing me there was an

[1:04:40] enticing Spirits we're here being led by
[1:04:43] the Holy Spirit the father God said
[1:04:45] today so many people are listening to
[1:04:46] enticing Spirits instead of taking the
[1:04:48] word of God Spirits there in the world
[1:04:51] they're demons and they go out into
[1:04:53] places and they get amongst me and
[1:04:54] ministers they get amongst church
[1:04:56] members they get amongst good people and
[1:04:58] they cause him to come into an illusion
[1:05:00] and they say things and do things and
[1:05:02] teach things oh God
[1:05:04] this is a mouthful of a quote and they
[1:05:08] practice things that's contrary to the
[1:05:10] word of God today ministers other
[1:05:12] congregations are allowing their people
[1:05:14] to play cards in the churches now that's
[1:05:16] not all together Catholics there's a lot
[1:05:18] of Protestants those had he said what
[1:05:20] they're trying to do is substitutionary
[1:05:22] something they try to adopt some new
[1:05:24] plan they try to adopt some education to
[1:05:27] take the place of the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:05:30] never be able to do it nothing should
[1:05:32] take the place of the faith of God can I
[1:05:34] say that again nothing should take the
[1:05:37] place of the faith of God can I say that
[1:05:39] again nothing should take the place of
[1:05:42] the faith of the setting let's say that
[1:05:44] together nothing should take the place
[1:05:47] of the faith of the Son of God can I say
[1:05:49] it to you like this nothing will take
[1:05:52] the place of the faith of the Son of God
[1:05:55] in the heart of a redeemed Son of God
[1:05:58] yeah what are you saying I'm saying that
[1:06:01] the faith of Jesus Christ is not dead it
[1:06:04] is alive and well are you hearing me
[1:06:07] Paul says I'm crucified with Christ
[1:06:09] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:06:12] liveth in me and the life which I now
[1:06:15] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[1:06:18] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:06:20] himself for me I don't have time to stop
[1:06:22] and preach her but I just want to drop
[1:06:24] something to you Paul said I live in the
[1:06:26] flesh you know people say to me all the
[1:06:28] time they said well brother Andrew amen

[1:06:52] are you hearing me there is not one time
[1:06:54] I am not in this flesh but my Bible says
[1:06:58] that there is a spirit called the Holy
[1:07:00] Spirit who will subdue and will mortify
[1:07:03] the Deeds of the flesh but no church
[1:07:05] some of y'all have been letting your
[1:07:07] flesh get the best of you for years but
[1:07:09] it's time to wake up and realize you are
[1:07:11] a part of the royal Seed of Abraham and
[1:07:14] you've got a right to bring your flesh
[1:07:16] subject to the promise of God's word

[1:07:21] Victory right now right now Church H
[1:07:24] book over the pride of life over the
[1:07:27] lust of the eye and over the lust of the
[1:07:29] flesh right now you are in Divine
[1:07:31] possession of authority over that flesh
[1:07:34] some of y'all right now that flesh says
[1:07:36] you shouldn't be here but you're here
[1:07:38] anyhow that flesh says Don't Say Amen
[1:07:40] but sister you're saying amen anyhow
[1:07:43] that flesh says don't raise your hand
[1:07:45] but you're raising your hand anyhow that
[1:07:47] precious don't stand up but you stand up
[1:07:50] anyhow because you are in charge of that
[1:07:53] place by the practice of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:57] we will not be in dominion over our
[1:07:59] flesh we are right now in Dominion
[1:08:02] we are right now in dominion over our
[1:08:06] flesh by the faith of the Son of God who
[1:08:09] loved me and gave his self for me
[1:08:11] program said Remember the infallible
[1:08:13] word of God as the sun rose up to show
[1:08:16] the Superstition so have you promised I
[1:08:18] I will restore all the years that
[1:08:21] caterpillars destroyed and the palm of
[1:08:23] worms and so forth how would they be
[1:08:25] restored again that tree would live
[1:08:28] again I'm on Church of that tree would
[1:08:31] live again what tree was he talking
[1:08:33] about he was talking about a brad tree
[1:08:35] that was
[1:08:37] the first chapter that they had eaten
[1:08:39] down to a stub
[1:08:43] born and he live again how they would be
[1:08:46] restored again we pray father you will
[1:08:49] send down Grace and the resurrection
[1:08:51] power of Christ that you might restore
[1:08:53] listen this resurrect us to a living
[1:08:56] faith in the Living Word of this day we
[1:08:58] ask it in Jesus name so in other words
[1:09:01] denominationalism crucified the faith of
[1:09:04] Jesus Christ but the message of the hour
[1:09:06] would be the voice of Resurrection that
[1:09:09] would resurrect the peace of God by the
[1:09:12] same quickening power that raised Jesus
[1:09:14] from the dead would call your faith from
[1:09:16] the grave of denomination
[1:09:19] come on you all know I'm preaching to
[1:09:20] you tonight the nomination killed some
[1:09:22] of y'all's faith it had you so weak you
[1:09:25] was hooked on psychologists you were
[1:09:27] following psychiatrists you didn't know
[1:09:28] if God could heal you you thought you
[1:09:30] had to put up with Devils but then one
[1:09:32] day you heard a little Prophet walk out
[1:09:34] behind a puppy and and say good evening
[1:09:36] friends and stand there a six foot man
[1:09:38] five foot whatever and square his
[1:09:40] shoulders back and say I take every
[1:09:42] spirit in this building under my control
[1:09:45] for the glory of almighty God what was
[1:09:47] that that was not denominational faith
[1:09:49] that was not hybrid faith that was pure
[1:09:52] unadulterated genuine perfect faith of
[1:09:55] almighty God returning to flesh
[1:10:00] and he said because I live ye live also
[1:10:04] denomination dismissed that verse
[1:10:06] because they had no understanding but a
[1:10:08] prophet with the faith of God said he's
[1:10:10] speaking to his wife
[1:10:13] because I live ye live also what a
[1:10:17] resurrection that was what a
[1:10:20] resurrection that was but what a
[1:10:23] resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:10:26] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[1:10:30] Jesus by God's quickening power he was
[1:10:33] waved to them the word which he was was
[1:10:36] way back to them on the day of Pentecost
[1:10:38] the word made manifest now and as I say
[1:10:42] it's to be waived again in the last day
[1:10:45] come on now that's that's the Leviticus
[1:10:48] 23 the waving of the thief the word was
[1:10:51] to be waved again in the last days I
[1:10:54] don't have the court in front of me but
[1:10:55] he says it like this that the Dead
[1:10:57] traditions of denominational listen
[1:10:59] would fall off of the church that the
[1:11:02] full word in his full strength in its
[1:11:04] full power would return to a full Church
[1:11:08] what are you saying I'm saying the faith
[1:11:10] that was in the groom has been
[1:11:12] resurrected in the bride I'm on Church
[1:11:14] the faith that's in the groom has been
[1:11:17] resurrected in the bride you say what is
[1:11:19] Faith Reverend said faith is a
[1:11:21] revelation of the will of God so by
[1:11:24] Revelation do you realize you can
[1:11:26] actually now according to a prophet go
[1:11:28] read Hebrews 11 from 11 1 to 11 32 and
[1:11:32] every place you see by faith you can now
[1:11:35] say bye Revelation
[1:11:37] is that okay you can now say bye
[1:11:40] Revelation you say well by what
[1:11:42] Authority do you say that by the
[1:11:43] authority of the seventh angel because
[1:11:45] he said faith is a revelation among
[1:11:49] church Faith is not putting your name on
[1:11:50] a church membership faith is not joining
[1:11:52] a church it's not reciting a Creed it's
[1:11:55] the revelation of Jesus Christ which is
[1:11:58] the will of God taking possession in the
[1:12:00] flesh of humanity
[1:12:02] and the church he says today the church
[1:12:05] don't even believe in spirit Revelation
[1:12:06] they believe in a dogmatic peace into
[1:12:08] some system but may I remind you what
[1:12:10] Paul said he said Faith cometh by
[1:12:13] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:12:16] how many knows preaches 1963 perfect
[1:12:19] faith and in that tape he says now Faith
[1:12:22] we're told in the Bible that Faith
[1:12:24] cometh by hearing now you cannot be
[1:12:26] saved without faith
[1:12:28] that's right and faith is something that
[1:12:32] you have to believe it's there that
[1:12:34] really nothing else will declare it's
[1:12:36] there but faith
[1:12:42] I've been in perfect Faith all day and
[1:12:45] my head's still spinning on that one and
[1:12:47] faith is something that you have to
[1:12:49] believe it's there that really nothing
[1:12:51] else will declare it's there but Faith
[1:12:54] so what's he saying there's no other way
[1:12:57] to understanding outside of Faith that's
[1:12:59] right now listen when the prophet of God
[1:13:02] said it works with faith Express he said
[1:13:04] light my little ego last night he knew
[1:13:06] when he heard that scream of the mother
[1:13:08] Eagle there's a lot of difference
[1:13:09] between that and the cluck of the hen
[1:13:12] are you hearing me bad Eagle oh god
[1:13:14] brother Ariel that eagle had never one
[1:13:17] time heard the scream of an eagle
[1:13:20] are you hearing me he had been in an
[1:13:22] eagle but he was born in a barnyard and
[1:13:24] a chicken and the eagle was gone so all
[1:13:27] he had ever heard was the clucking of a
[1:13:29] hen that's right
[1:13:31] right and the Brother Juan there was no
[1:13:33] schools he could go to that they could
[1:13:35] train him on how to know what an eagle
[1:13:37] sounds like there was no there was no
[1:13:41] colleges there were no Bible seminaries
[1:13:43] that could sit him bound and say listen
[1:13:45] here you're not a chicken you're an
[1:13:47] eagle and someday somewhere you'll hear
[1:13:50] a scream and it'll sound like this there
[1:13:52] was nothing in him except a seed but who
[1:13:55] he really was
[1:13:56] come on church are you hearing me he
[1:13:59] didn't know the difference in a cluck
[1:14:01] and a scream see but he was an eagle
[1:14:03] from the egg he was an eagle from the
[1:14:05] egg are you hearing me Church you was
[1:14:08] the son of God from the dean of God he
[1:14:10] was the daughter of God from the gene of
[1:14:12] God could nobody teach you could nobody
[1:14:15] train you to understand the sound of the
[1:14:17] end time but there was a seed on the
[1:14:20] inside of you
[1:14:21] glory to God there was a seed only
[1:14:24] inside of you that when you heard the
[1:14:26] eagle scream what when you heard the
[1:14:28] pure sound of the Revelation the will of
[1:14:30] God and the age that you're living in
[1:14:32] something in that voice connected with
[1:14:35] something in your soul
[1:14:37] [Applause]
[1:14:39] hallelujah hallelujah there was a
[1:14:42] connection between the voice and the
[1:14:44] Soul
[1:14:45] that's right come on Church oh God I
[1:14:48] feel like preaching right now in the
[1:14:50] heart of that eagle in the heart of that
[1:14:52] eagle was a DNA of an eagle and for the
[1:14:55] first time when he heard the eagle
[1:14:57] scream from his heart connected to his
[1:15:00] lips and he said I'm not a chicken I am
[1:15:03] an eagle
[1:15:08] always
[1:15:10] Sunny are you hearing me do you see why
[1:15:12] you're sitting here tonight it's because
[1:15:14] in your soul there was a predestinated
[1:15:16] seed and in your soul there was a teen
[1:15:19] but from the voice of the seventh angel
[1:15:21] there come a quickening power uphold
[1:15:23] that seed by the spirit of almighty God
[1:15:26] and you say I'm not a Baptist I'm not a
[1:15:28] Pentecostal I'm not a Catholic I'm not
[1:15:31] an atheist I'm a son
[1:15:33] all right
[1:15:34] I'm a God of God there was a connection
[1:15:37] between the heart and the mouth
[1:15:41] he didn't know what that eagle sounded
[1:15:42] like oh God but he wasn't made an eagle
[1:15:45] right then he always was an eagle are
[1:15:48] you ready for this and a Christian
[1:15:50] always was a Christian
[1:15:52] oh my that's the reason the divorce when
[1:15:55] you're divorced because you were trapped
[1:15:56] into it see by your first parent Adam
[1:15:58] and Eve you become a sinner by Nature
[1:16:01] you didn't want to be you did not want
[1:16:04] to be but now you heard the gospel right
[1:16:07] you heard the gospel and Faith cometh by
[1:16:11] hearing this is what he says Revelation
[1:16:13] comes by hearing
[1:16:16] what is Faith it's a revelation of the
[1:16:19] will of God faith cometh by hearing
[1:16:22] revelation
[1:16:24] oh God Revelation coming back right can
[1:16:28] I preach to you for a second you got
[1:16:29] more than just the revelation of the
[1:16:31] seventh seal

[1:16:35] godhead or a water baptism or serpent
[1:16:37] seed he got more than a rebel
[1:16:40] Heaven Thunders you've got the most
[1:16:42] powerful Revelation you could give Who
[1:16:45] You Are

[1:16:51] get an education of who you are and a
[1:16:53] revelation the seventh seal you've got a
[1:16:55] revelation of Who You Are by the
[1:16:56] revelation of the seventh seal
[1:16:58] are you hearing me this is not education
[1:17:01] this is not intellectualism this is
[1:17:03] revelation it's line upon line it's
[1:17:06] precept upon precept it's word upon word
[1:17:09] it's Faith cometh by hearing Revelation
[1:17:11] comes by hearing and he says there's a
[1:17:13] little something inside of you another
[1:17:16] man sitting right by you say I don't
[1:17:18] believe that stuff nonsense I don't
[1:17:20] believe that nothing to that see it's a
[1:17:22] revelation of who you are two men read
[1:17:26] the same book one man walked out and
[1:17:28] said I'm so mad that man called me a
[1:17:30] chicken right another man walked out and
[1:17:33] said that's the best sermon I ever heard
[1:17:34] he called me an eagle
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:43] and understand it because William
[1:17:44] Branham was not clucking he was
[1:17:46] screaming

[1:17:55] him when a lion roars it puts a scream
[1:17:58] out through the jungle and the other
[1:17:59] lines recognize the screen
[1:18:02] hell what are you saying I'm saying that
[1:18:05] Jesus himself had faith
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:09] now the father of God said the only
[1:18:10] thing you have to do then is have faith
[1:18:11] in what you are have faith in what the
[1:18:13] word says you are and Jesus had faith in
[1:18:17] the word of God that said what he was it
[1:18:19] is written of me that David say in the
[1:18:22] Psalms the prophets all them that speak
[1:18:23] of him I am the bread of life that come
[1:18:25] from God out of Heaven amen I am the
[1:18:28] Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I
[1:18:30] am all these things I am that I am and
[1:18:32] he knew with that perfect faith that he
[1:18:34] was the anointed Messiah that the spirit
[1:18:37] of God was upon him he said now I and
[1:18:40] myself do nothing but it's my faith in
[1:18:43] God yeah that's right oh God I wish I
[1:18:47] was a preacher right now are you hearing
[1:18:49] me are you hearing me it was not himself
[1:18:52] it was his faith in God and God was in
[1:18:55] him the word made manifest when the word
[1:18:59] of God comes in you it's made manifest
[1:19:02] for you are a Believer and a Believer oh
[1:19:05] God a Believer is the faith of God that
[1:19:09] moves in you a Believer is the faith of
[1:19:13] God that moves in you do you realize
[1:19:16] that we are not the recipients of
[1:19:18] Abraham's hope oh my we are not the
[1:19:22] recipient of the hope of the Son of God
[1:19:24] we are the recipients of Abraham's Faith
[1:19:27] the Bible said that before him who he
[1:19:30] believed even God who quickeneth for
[1:19:32] dead and called him thanks which are not
[1:19:33] be not as though they were listen
[1:19:35] Abraham's Faith was more than
[1:19:38] expectation that's right are you hearing
[1:19:40] me if you go to Genesis 18 10 he said I
[1:19:42] will certainly return unto thee
[1:19:43] according to the time of life and lo
[1:19:46] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:19:48] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:19:50] was behind him now Abraham and share
[1:19:53] were old they were well stricken in age
[1:19:55] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:19:57] men or women do you realize that Abraham
[1:20:00] has just received a visitation of Elohim
[1:20:03] to the tent door and Elohim says you're
[1:20:06] going to have a child Elohim says at the
[1:20:09] time of life I will return to thee and
[1:20:12] he will bring forth a child do you
[1:20:13] realize when Abraham got done with his
[1:20:16] visitation from Elohim brother Ariel he
[1:20:19] turned around and looked at Sam era and
[1:20:21] she was old
[1:20:23] well-stricken in age her womb was dead
[1:20:25] her milk Rings dried up can I say this
[1:20:28] can I give you something to think about
[1:20:30] her body was in a bad shape but
[1:20:32] Abraham's Faith was in a good condition
[1:20:42] shape but his face
[1:20:44] condition because his faith was not a
[1:20:47] contested trapped faith in humanity his
[1:20:50] faith was the faith of Jehovah
[1:20:53] I'm on Church his faith was the faith of
[1:20:56] Elohim his faith was the faith of el
[1:20:58] shadia do you see who you are tonight oh
[1:21:01] you say preacher you say I'm going to
[1:21:03] have a body change and my gray hair is
[1:21:04] going to be turned back back again and
[1:21:06] the dead are going to raise do you not
[1:21:08] see our condition oh I see your
[1:21:10] condition but I say this your faith
[1:21:12] looks better than your body
[1:21:15] are you hearing me your faith looks
[1:21:18] better than the graveyard your faith
[1:21:20] looks better than the situation that
[1:21:22] you're going through
[1:21:23] that's right
[1:21:25] that's right I'm talking about a faith
[1:21:28] that can transform things from
[1:21:30] expectation in a manifestation among
[1:21:33] church when Elohim left Abraham and
[1:21:36] Sarah store Abraham and Sarah was under
[1:21:38] expectation it was not until Elohim oh
[1:21:42] God it was not until Elohim changed
[1:21:44] their bodies come on now that their
[1:21:46] expectation went to manifestation you
[1:21:49] realize what Paul says Romans 8 19 that
[1:21:52] faith will actually transform our
[1:21:54] expectation into manifestation somebody
[1:21:57] say this with me expectation
[1:21:59] okay now say manifestation
[1:22:03] I preached one time on the Revival of
[1:22:04] manifestation
[1:22:07] it's a powerful fault when you start
[1:22:08] looking at it that we talk about
[1:22:10] expectation but what goodness it do if
[1:22:13] it never becomes manifestation I'm
[1:22:15] expecting I'm expecting I'm expected
[1:22:17] come on now your mother's in here carry
[1:22:20] that baby for nine months how many times
[1:22:22] do you say I'm expecting I'm expected
[1:22:25] I'm expecting are you hearing me but
[1:22:28] after nine months come on now if there's
[1:22:31] not a birth then there's something wrong
[1:22:32] with that expectation that's right are
[1:22:34] you hearing me if there's not a birth
[1:22:36] then all it's been is expectation but
[1:22:38] when the water breaks and the blood
[1:22:40] breaks and the baby comes forth and the
[1:22:43] voice screams out hormone Church it is
[1:22:46] now gone from expectation to
[1:22:47] manifestation come on now you're with me
[1:22:49] aren't you then the jeans see that was
[1:22:51] in the father is now transformed through
[1:22:54] holy wedlock and is now manifested in
[1:22:57] flesh and a born child of his own
[1:22:59] heritage
[1:23:01] oh God don't you see why the devil hates
[1:23:04] you it's because you are the product of
[1:23:07] the invisible Union
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:12] of the transformation of sea life
[1:23:15] through the holy wedlock that Eve failed
[1:23:18] in the beginning but the second Eve will
[1:23:21] not fall
[1:23:23] says the earnest expectation of the
[1:23:26] creature Waited For What the
[1:23:28] manifestation of the sons of God now
[1:23:31] program said see look he said hope looks
[1:23:33] for something way off but Faith claims
[1:23:36] it right now
[1:23:37] can somebody say with me right now
[1:23:40] hope looks for it in the future Faith
[1:23:43] claims it right now see faith says God
[1:23:47] said so and it's mine that settle said I
[1:23:50] don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm
[1:23:51] still blind if I'm still sick that don't
[1:23:54] have nothing to do with it I believe it
[1:23:57] anyhow it's mine right now God said so
[1:24:00] that settles it damn it that's right
[1:24:03] but hope says What God Says so and I'm
[1:24:07] expecting to get it someday you see I'm
[1:24:10] expecting someday as long as Satan can
[1:24:13] put you off to another day that's as
[1:24:15] good as he wants you'll never get it
[1:24:18] just believe that you got it right now
[1:24:22] it's your personal property
[1:24:26] come on now in order to do that you're
[1:24:29] going to exercise who you really are
[1:24:31] in order to exercise who you really are
[1:24:35] you've got to have a revelation of who
[1:24:36] you really are faith is the substance of
[1:24:39] things hoped for it's the evidence of
[1:24:41] Things Not Seen remember I said Faith
[1:24:43] acts now it's positive oh my I tell you
[1:24:45] sickness and everything else when Faith
[1:24:47] steps in it's just like a snowball on a
[1:24:49] hot stove it just melts away everything
[1:24:51] goes away from Faith cause Faith stands
[1:24:54] up and takes overrule When Faith speaks
[1:24:57] everybody else keeps steal that's right
[1:25:00] so what did Paul say he said the earnest
[1:25:03] expectation of the creature is waiting
[1:25:06] for what the manifestation of the sons
[1:25:10] of God look at this word manifestation
[1:25:12] it means to be revealed it means a
[1:25:15] laying bear and making naked a
[1:25:17] disclosure of Truth instruction
[1:25:18] concerning things before unknown it is
[1:25:21] used of events by which things or states
[1:25:24] or persons hither YouTube withdrawn from
[1:25:27] view are made visible to all
[1:25:30] manifestation it is an appearance now
[1:25:33] how many knows that a prophet said this
[1:25:36] is an adoption time
[1:25:38] can I have a few more minutes this is
[1:25:41] the adoption time for them did not
[1:25:44] preach four parts on adoption to waste
[1:25:45] his time
[1:25:46] is that okay this a message is an
[1:25:50] adoption message
[1:25:52] Luther Wesley Pentecost the rep said the
[1:25:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for
[1:25:59] the person himself to come into the body
[1:26:03] so you're not under a Pentecostal
[1:26:06] servant anointing you have been restored
[1:26:09] to a sonship
[1:26:11] yes that's right
[1:26:13] man yeah that's right you never were a
[1:26:17] servant in the eyes of the father
[1:26:20] you always were a son come on Church you
[1:26:24] got to get out for that mentality
[1:26:25] because you failed come on prodigal and
[1:26:28] you went away from God you know what the
[1:26:30] prodigal done the product will come home
[1:26:32] where the mentality about himself he
[1:26:35] come home with this confession I'll just
[1:26:37] go home and be a servant I'll just go
[1:26:39] back home and I'll serve in my father's
[1:26:41] Kingdom but when the father saw him the
[1:26:44] father did not say go serve the kingdom
[1:26:47] the father said Kingdom get the best
[1:26:49] robe bring forth a good pair of shoes
[1:26:51] Put a Ring upon his finger come on what
[1:26:55] was he he never was a servant in the
[1:26:58] eyes of his father he always was a son
[1:27:02] hi come on church and under denomination
[1:27:05] you as a slave under denomination you as
[1:27:08] a servant but under the revelation of
[1:27:11] the son of man in the seventh age it
[1:27:14] opens your eyes that you are not going
[1:27:15] to be the Sons and Daughters of God you
[1:27:18] always were
[1:27:20] the Sons and Daughters of God can I tell
[1:27:22] you what the prophet says and the Bible
[1:27:23] adoption part two in the Bible the last
[1:27:26] days we're living the top of the pyramid
[1:27:28] we have now come to the top of the
[1:27:31] pyramid what God is from the bottom to
[1:27:33] the top faith
[1:27:34] that's right the cross fish is the
[1:27:37] cancer age in the Zodiac in the time of
[1:27:39] the coming of the other line in this cap
[1:27:41] in a stone but in the days of the
[1:27:43] manifestation of the sons of God in the
[1:27:45] Bible see we're at we're at the end time
[1:27:48] adoption part three this is the day of
[1:27:51] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:27:54] when the Mysteries that has been hid
[1:27:56] since the foundation of the world is to
[1:28:00] be made known this is the hour come on
[1:28:04] church but I'm sending them in the
[1:28:05] message he said God does not reveal
[1:28:07] something unless there's Eyes Upon Earth
[1:28:10] to see it he does not release something
[1:28:12] unless there's something to receive what
[1:28:15] he is releasing come on church do you
[1:28:17] not see who you are do you not see why
[1:28:19] you're the most powerful force of people
[1:28:21] on the face of the Earth that these
[1:28:23] Mysteries that have been hid since
[1:28:25] before the foundation of the world would
[1:28:28] be released in the end time at the same
[1:28:31] time that the Mysteries were being
[1:28:33] released there was a surprise being
[1:28:35] released from the fear and scare of who
[1:28:37] she is to realize she was predestinated
[1:28:39] from before the foundation can I just
[1:28:43] cut to the point and say like this you
[1:28:45] are the place that's the mysteries from
[1:28:47] the foundation of the world and God have
[1:28:49] met into a body of Flesh and you're

[1:34:46] believer of Jesus Christ I give it to
[1:34:48] you in the name of Jesus Christ there's
[1:34:50] a manifestation oh brother my crops
[1:34:52] you're running up out yonder I haven't

[1:34:55] name of the Lord God bless your crop oh
[1:34:57] waiting growing all nature waiting for
[1:35:00] the manifestation of the sons somebody
[1:35:03] say Sons sons of God Amen God ordained
[1:35:06] it at the beginning
[1:35:08] let me ask you this what was Matthew 21
[1:35:10] the REM says it like this he says they
[1:35:13] were all there under expectation of the
[1:35:15] coming of the son of God
[1:35:19] singular praise but Romans 8 says
[1:35:22] they're under the expectation of the
[1:35:24] manifested sons
[1:35:26] Matthew 21 manifested son singular Jesus
[1:35:31] Romans 8 manifested Sons plural Church
[1:35:35] age book it is very apparent that she
[1:35:37] ought to be called that for she was
[1:35:39] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:35:41] Source was eternal with him and is now
[1:35:44] manifesting God in a many-membered body
[1:35:47] amen
[1:35:49] whereas once thought was manifested in
[1:35:52] one member even our Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:35:54] the same except in the Corporal body he
[1:35:57] said now listen Jesus will return again
[1:35:59] in flesh or Corporal body he's going to
[1:36:02] come back and confess again he will
[1:36:03] prove that who is the only wise
[1:36:04] potentate he is he Jesus Christ Lord Of
[1:36:07] Glory but I want to tell you what a
[1:36:08] prophet said he said he was a man in one
[1:36:11] sense he was God in another sense he was
[1:36:13] a man in flesh and the spirit was God
[1:36:15] now notice this the Dove came on the
[1:36:17] lamb and the Two Become One the lamb was
[1:36:20] one creature the dove was another
[1:36:22] creature and when the Dove and the lamb
[1:36:24] United together God was manifested in
[1:36:28] the flesh that's right and now
[1:36:31] yes sir
[1:36:33] and now
[1:36:34] he's manifested in your flesh
[1:36:37] [Music]
[1:36:38] by being adopted Sons and Daughters to
[1:36:41] the kingdom of God through the baptism
[1:36:43] of the Holy Spirit that's right old
[1:36:45] church you got the power if you got the
[1:36:48] face to use it amen that's right
[1:36:51] he's saying I'm saying the authority of
[1:36:54] God
[1:36:55] power of God that's right the faith of
[1:36:57] God
[1:36:58] has returned in the sons of God
[1:37:01] and they're no longer invisible
[1:37:05] they've been made visible by the
[1:37:07] ripening of the son
[1:37:10] do you realize what Authority you have
[1:37:12] tonight
[1:37:13] you have the authority to fire
[1:37:18] yes and you have the authority to hire
[1:37:22] are you hearing me that's right right
[1:37:23] adopted Sons the father has put into
[1:37:26] your use
[1:37:28] the authority of the Kingdom I may have
[1:37:31] told this here but I'll set real quick
[1:37:32] back back in West Virginia there was
[1:37:34] when I lived there there was a brother
[1:37:35] there his father owned a construction
[1:37:37] company one of the biggest construction
[1:37:38] companies there in the area I mean big
[1:37:40] big time construction worker real good
[1:37:42] reputation of a man well I was there one
[1:37:44] time and I got to talking to him and his
[1:37:46] son actually was basically the runner of
[1:37:49] the business owner of the business I
[1:37:50] mean he is his son so there was a guy
[1:37:53] that come out on the job one day and he
[1:37:55] got to acting around you know and so the
[1:37:57] Sun goes over and says listen
[1:37:59] he says get to work or go home pretty
[1:38:03] much get to work or go home or you're
[1:38:05] fired and the guy turns around and says
[1:38:07] you can't say that to me I'll go call
[1:38:10] your daddy
[1:38:12] he said okay go call my dad
[1:38:15] he said and your dad well he said what
[1:38:17] will your dad say he said my dad will
[1:38:19] say the same thing

[1:52:53] amen
[1:52:55] amen thank you Father praise the Lord
[1:53:00] Hallelujah since you see why we say it
[1:53:04] on Sunday
[1:53:06] by the early church
[1:53:08] emphasis was not on love
[1:53:12] the emphasis of the early church because
[1:53:15] that was the foundation stone
[1:53:19] their emphasis was the faith of Jesus
[1:53:21] Christ they wanted to see the same work
[1:53:23] that was in Christ because you see you
[1:53:27] will never have the love of God until
[1:53:29] the Faith of Christ is expressed through
[1:53:31] you
[1:53:33] while the church called love to today is
[1:53:36] just sympathy and feelings you know we
[1:53:39] we want people to be sorry for us but
[1:53:42] when the faith of God is expressed
[1:53:44] through you that's when you will see the
[1:53:46] love of God
[1:53:49] praise the Lord amen I mean The Church
[1:53:53] Must Be
[1:53:55] the faith of God on two feet not looking
[1:53:59] for people to feel sorry for you
[1:54:02] praise the Lord
[1:54:04] because you are that you are that very
[1:54:06] expression of the faith of God
[1:54:09] [Music]
[1:54:14] you just think about it tonight
[1:54:16] that the faith that is glory in your
[1:54:19] body
[1:54:21] is stronger so you see that's the reason
[1:54:24] why the devil would make you to pay
[1:54:26] attention to your symptoms
[1:54:29] because he knows that your faith is
[1:54:31] stronger than your symptoms
[1:54:35] he knows that your faith is stronger
[1:54:37] than your feelings
[1:54:39] your faith is stronger than your
[1:54:41] thoughts
[1:54:42] and God is not looking at your symptoms
[1:54:44] he's not looking at your feelings he's
[1:54:46] looking at your faith
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:54:51] praise the Lord
[1:54:53] faith is the foundation stone
[1:54:57] love is the Capstone
[1:55:00] praise the Lord
[1:55:03] so if we can get the foundation right
[1:55:09] it's already
[1:55:11] Faith coming by hearing hearing of the
[1:55:13] word of God every time you receive the
[1:55:15] word and you identify with Thy word you
[1:55:17] say Amen you embrace the word by saying
[1:55:20] amen you embrace the word by lifting up
[1:55:23] your hands receiving that word you
[1:55:25] embrace the word every time you Embrace
[1:55:28] that word it's faith that you are
[1:55:30] pocketing
[1:55:32] every time you say Amen to the world you
[1:55:35] are packing flame again praise the Lord
[1:55:38] and then sometimes you're going away
[1:55:40] from this Terrace you feel so tired
[1:55:44] why because you are just burning on a
[1:55:46] fan you have packed so much faith in
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:55:56] or may the Lord bring to pass the word
[1:55:58] that was prophesied

[1:56:03] Lord bring to pass every promise that
