us last night amen and his blessings of waking us up this morning praise the lord amen water service last night amen praise the lord we so glad that the lord came in a special way to to speak to us and we're looking forward to having ministering to us this morning again praise the lord i just saw the note here that we share and but ben want to bring a tribute to brother scat but ben you have three minutes to do that so you can come and bring your tribute uh god bless you saints uh three minutes already i'll give a summary well uh i'd like to remember this uh take this time to remember our brother scott uh i had a few points to give but i'll give only two one uh brother scott was very approachable that's why i found it you found him to be uh there's a time i had questions i had something that i needed some advice on what was going on in the workplace so i uh i went to him asked him approached him asked him for an advice and the advice that he gave me really helped me to make a decision that was a sound decision a godly sounding decision on what i was doing so uh brother scott i'll put it on the next point too it's about hospitality he practiced hospitality i remember very well every time we'd come to evening service he would welcome us to his home with open homes it was a very good time we had one time i remember one time we had we slept over and then in the morning we had a breakfast uh with the family i think uh sister faith was there and brother um what's his name brother on loyal i think so and we had a very good uh he made us breakfast yeah sister uh our sister made us breakfast too and we sat outside there and he was giving us stories and uh console and you know encouraging us i'll never forget that uh that morning and uh i'd like to say uh surely he was your dear brother will miss him uh in various front i know he has helped many people in different ways but for me the main two things that i remember for of him is godly counsel and hospitality those are the two things that i remember from our brother and he was a good brother i remember he was showing us even i wanted to talk about the video or the movie that was showing us about uh another kid was following a balloon that was being uh the the weed would carry the balloon and he would run looking for it there were lessons there that he taught us of which i think three minutes will not be enough so thank you so much bro brothers we thank you and uh like to pray tribute to the family and i really pray for the family for strength for grace even this time i know uh they're going through that uh myself i remember when i lost my dad i think i was 20 21. i know what was going on and really support from the people nearby you really helps and it gives you strength but above all the strength that comes from the lord is this true strength it keeps you going no matter what the circumstances whatever whether it's the hills whether it's the valleys whether it's the wind whether it's the waves he will come all that the name of the lord is a strong tower amen praise the lord we we thank the lord for that and we will uh the memories of our brother will live in our hearts amen praise lord we we are so so we can i was a blessed to have spend some time with him on this side of eternity praise the lord amen now uh we know that we won't have service on wednesday night this coming

me and i will be gone on wednesday night i'll be speaking in dc so just keep me in your prayers and uh um oh i think that's what we have for announcement now i know our wednesday service is uh 7 p.m in the evening so normally when we have service on the weekend and we have change of time they really throw people off sometimes i ask myself do the people really hear me when i announced the time and so i know some people came in late yesterday evening thinking it was our seven o'clock time but on saturday night if we can start early and we give us some time to be able to get out and get back in the morning praise the lord amen so uh no service wednesday night like we all know and then we'll see you on on saturday evening if we can sit at 6 pm for those that will be able to make it and those that won't be able to make it we will we guess you'll be able to stream into the service but we have better team has shown with us we will have him speak saturday night and sunday morning and uh sister naomi and her family should have been here this morning but sister grace will be traveling now then they were preparing some thank you cards to send out to different ones and i learned they stay up a little bit late and they couldn't make it in this morning so i was asked to to greet the church and appreciate each and every one of you for your prayers we are hoping to have them back in church soon praise the lord let's stand on our feet and uh praise the lord what a wonderful savior we serve amen [Music] let's just bring worship to the lord a little bit and then we can sing a song in and ask the preacher to come up amen let's sing wow so [Music] praise the lord [Music] y'all know this brother won so you just got to be patient amen sometimes i give a song and the technician had

expectation believing that god will speak to us he would be with our house this morning amen i woke up this morning with my mind on jesus let's sing the akuros while our brother come and bring us the word [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] i'm [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Applause] me [Applause] stays [Music] [Applause] [Applause] we are victorious through his victory this morning it meant everything the the devil tried this morning it didn't work amen i i was thinking a little bit this morning there of how we're nearing the whole year going out in the new year coming in and facing thanksgiving here in just a few days and a few days this year will be over amen but i'm so thankful to still be standing amen still have a mind to serve the lord to hear his word and to bless his name and to believe the message of the hour and to be together with believers and like precious faith [Music] honor to be in his house this morning and then we greet you in the name of the lord we counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you all once again this morning we want to invite you in the scriptures if you have your bibles with us we'll go to the book of psalms the 37th chapter i want to look there in the fourth verse of psalms 37 and verse number four psalms 37 verse number four uh the people working the sound back there you can actually turn this floor monitor down just a little bit this ear monitor is working great this morning amen amen we sure thank the lord for the opportunity to be with you all once again and to have the privilege to fellowship with you and to see you all once again and once again we want to say we're sure praying for the church here and the carlin family and i know it's uh i was talking to brother daryl ward actually the other day and he was we're speaking about how that several folks we know recently have crossed over and i know it's a little bit more of a difficult time now for a family especially being around the holiday season and to think that the family member won't be there this year but there's one thing we have a confidence and a comfort this morning is is we're going to a place where they'll be and we'll be there and that's at the marriage supper of the lamb and then to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord and so in just a few days we're all going to be in a great reunion and i'll tell you i'm looking forward to that amen and sure want to say brother one we thank you for allowing us to come once again good to have brother thomas cross here with us again we want to say that this morning and just before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together for a word of prayer this morning how many have a need upon your heart amen the lord is mindful of that let's just ask him to come heavenly father lord as you believe in children have gathered themselves together here in your house lord father there's one thing we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever and lord your word does not fail it cannot fail and this morning lord as we gather in this service father we're not gathering to be seen we're not gathering to be heard but lord we are gathering to worship you and to honor you in the power of your resurrection and i pray this morning oh god as we endeavor lord to look into your word father as i feel inspired and led in my heart to go this direction this morning i'm asking that you would come father may you not only anoint the speaker to speak through me father but may you anoint thee hearer father lord as you would anoint us father may you speak through me lord may you hear through them father and lord we know that if you speak lord and you hear father there'll be no confusion lord there'll be no misunderstandings oh god and father i pray for every believer here today you've seen the hands that were raised father you know the needs whether it be physical or spiritual material father lord financial needs lord whatever the needs would be lord if it would be situations in homes or marriages or families oh god i am a firm believer this morning lord that if i were to pass this microphone through this congregation and take a a list of all the needs when the last person had spoken and the last need had been made known lord i'm a believer that there would not be one need that we would heard that you couldn't move upon that need so this morning father come and take preeminence among us lord forgive us of our failures oh god forgive us of our shortcomings lord and lord may you just speak to somebody's heart here today father bless this assembly lord bless brother juan father bless his ministry oh god bless this church lord father once again we ask you to be mindful of the carlin family lord lord may you be mindful of this assembly father lord give us assurance this morning father that just a few more days and we're going home we love you today god we ask these things in your wonderful name the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers says amen and amen the book of psalms the 37th chapter and the fourth verse i had a whole different thought on my heart this morning but the lord totally changed it last night so i'm just going to follow him if that's okay this morning psalms 37 and verse 4 david here writing says delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the lord and trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass notice he's doing this it's not the person it's god he shall bring forth the righteousness as the lie in thy judgment as the noonday rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass he says seeks from anger and forsake wrath and fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evil doers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth amen also i want to look with you in the book of luke the book of saint luke the 23rd chapter luke the 23rd chapter and if we could look there this morning in the 44th verse maybe i know it's a bit of a different uh scriptures to be putting together but if the lord would help us i've got a few things here out of this i'd like to share with you luke the 23rd chapter and the 44th verse the bible here speaking of christ crucifixion death burial and resurrection in the 44th verse he said and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst and when jesus had cried with a loud voice notice what he said father into thy hands i commend my spirit in other words what he was saying father into thy hands i commit my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost amen we ask the lord this even this morning rather to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning from those passages of scripture for just a few moments if the lord would help me today i want to talk to you here on the fault of into thy hands into thy hands i tell you this morning i am thankful that we have a place to put all of our problems to put all of our situations to put all of our circumstances and that is into the hands of almighty god and i find it amazing here in psalms 37 that david is speaking of ways and david will say it like this he says commit thy way unto the lord then he will speak of another way he says fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way now when you read psalms 37 you'll find that david is speaking amen of the happy state of the godly and the short-lived prosperity of the wicked so david is showing you amen that the godly are going to be in a happy state but the wicked are not going to prosper very long and david is actually he's admonishing the church they meant not to get all tore up or to get worried or get concerned about the wicked and their prosperous in their way now when you think of this word commitment it is the state amen or quality of being dedicated to a cause to an activity to a pledge or to an undertaking amen i think of how that the prophet of god will preach a message called god's provided way i want you to notice the title of that amen god's provided way he said now just for a few moments he said i just have been doing this is exalting christ i want to use the subject of this he meant god's provided way he said you know there's two ways for all things right he said you are aware of that that's your way and that's god's way how many is aware that there is our way and then there is god's way he said and you can't have your own way and be in god's way at the same time you have to get out of your own way amen and listen to this and let god have his way amen you've got to get out of your own way and let god have his way he said now you're either right or you're left right if you're going your way and i want you to hear this quote if you're going your way then you're out of god's way if you cease from your own way then you get in god's way god can have his way when you cease to have your weight but as long as you're having your way then god cannot have his way so you have to go one or the other ways amen so let's just drop our own way and let's let god have his way amen let's drop our own way and let's let god have his way another place he said in the in my story he said now there is a perfect way and there is a permissive way and i feel that if god here on the platform can show me things it is and in my rooms and so forth he is able to tell me just where he wants me and what he wants me to do but i feel as long as i've got it all hooked up or i feel like being he won't put his hands on it now watch this as long as i'm trying to work it out he won't put his hands on it as long as i'm doing it that's the way it is as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them he meant god cannot fight your battle you're fighting it yourself amen so let's just let loose and let him do it let's just commit it to him he said now listen this the greatest weapon i know of of a christian today is a committal to god he meant the greatest weapon i know of a christian today is a commitment to god when you can't do nothing about it you just commit it to him and god will take care of it amen i don't the greatest victory i received in the situation was when i come to the place but in divine hands i commend the situation amen i think it's a powerful thing this morning they met what about on this sunday morning we commit everything we are amen under god let's commit our families to god let's commit our church yeah let's commit our ministries let's commit everything in our families even he is the god that's able to take care of the situation he is the god that's able to move even my i think about that there are two ways there is a permissive way amen then there is a perfect way there is man's way and then there is god's way do you realize the fall in the card and amen actually took man out of god's way amen and brought him into his own way he meant before the fall in the garden adam and eve was operating and doing things god's way but after the fall and then they began to do things man's way amen look here in john the 10th chapter and the first verse jesus says verily verily i say unto you amen he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold now watch this but climbeth up amen some other way the same is a thief and a robber the prophet said he'd come up man's way he come up some way he came the church's way or some other way amen but god has a way provided and that way is jesus and when you come by jesus you take on jesus by a spiritual baptism and you are dead and take on christ by the new birth and you're born again and filled with his spirit amen and how you know because the life amen your life will compare with foes of the bible ain't been the apostles who was robbed in his righteousness amen then why can't amen people who claim to be christians believe in signs and wonders and divine healing and the working of the holy ghost amen why they should do it the thing of it is amen they've come in some other way besides the door hey if they come through the door hear this now they would be robed with the same kind of spirit they would have the same kind of life they would have the same kind of testimony they would be the same kind of people and then see that other words if you come in the message other than the way of the door and then you're not going to believe in the things that the message teaches amen if you come in the message by a man's way amen the message is going to be just another idea it's going to be just another biblical approach amendment if you come in this message it'll be the absolute church it'll be the direction of god it'll be the answer to the question it'll be the tearing down amen of every stronghold amen will be the message of the hour amen i think it's amazing the prophet tells us that god amen hasn't provided somebody shout provided provide god has a provided amen meant an original way to do things and he'll never do it contrary to that amen do you realize the fall in the garden caused man to come out of god's way and go into his own way and a prophet will preach an entire sermon called the way back amen listen that the way back amen not a way leaving there to be many ways but he preaches the way back and says there's many ways out amen but there's only one way back he meant there's many ways out of the will of god but there's only one way back in the way of god there's many ways out of fellowship with god but there's only one way back in fellowship with god there's many ways out of the blessings of god but there's only one way back to the blessings of god and to thank today friends on this thanksgiving service we've got something to be thankful for they've been that while the world is looking for a way back into the anointing into the supernatural into the blessings of god into the things of god amen back amen the way found us into the place of blessing listen you're not sitting outside the essence of god you're sitting in the middle of the blessings of god this morning by the message of the hour by the restoration of the way of god my baby when i think about this i rejoice amen to tell you this morning we are not a people of a partial restoration amen we are the generation promised a full restoration the book of job the second chapter says be glad then eat children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain martyr and he will cause to come down for you amen the amen the floor shall be full of wheat amen the fat shall overflow with wine at all amen and i will restore somebody shall i will restore amen to you the years the locusts have eaten and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the pomegranate my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god who it dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed in other words prophesying that everything the devil has taken from the church god would send a ministry that would be the torah and the latter ever that would be a teaching it would be a harvest reign it would bring the bringing of the restoration of the things the devil had taken from the church amen what did he say he said i will restore amen i will restore look it with this word restore it means to return to the former owner it means to bring back to the former state or condition do you realize that god said in malachi 4 amen i will restore behold i send them to you elijah the prophet and he shall what shall turn or shall restore your hearts to the faith of the apostolic cause in the message the uniting time inside he says restore back the original the pentecostal faith back to the people with the same pentecostal message with the same sign the same pentecostal evidence the same god the same power the same teaching everything with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck paul down on the road he went down to damascus listen this is among us today doing the same things he did it that day amen the same message the same sign the same evidence the same power the same teaching with the same pillar of fire they've been doing the same thing today that he was doing back then amen i've often heard people say brother andrew i've heard brother adam say we need a burning bush experience or he'll say we need another ax2 experience or we need another ax4 experience or we need another damascus road experience and they'll say how in the world can we have they meant another burning bush experience when we're not at the burning bush amen how can we have a damascus road experience when we are not on the damascus road how can we have an axe to experience when we're not gathered in the upper room in the book of acts amen but can i tell you amen the reason why a prophet said we needed that amen was not because of the place it was because of the person that was at the place it wasn't the burning bliss that changed moses it was it wasn't the damascus road that changed paul it was the pillar of fire that was on the damascus road that changed paul it wasn't the upper room that changed him it was the pillar of fire that descended into the upper room amen that changed them from being cowards into being courageous sons and daughters of god and right here this morning in minneapolis minnesota amen the same pillar of fire that was on the damascus road that was home to burning bush that was in the upper room has returned super tellership church meant to bring a transformation to release a restoration to anoint a young person to anoint a believer amen to believe we have come back under god's way of doing things in the aids that we're living in oh my that pillar of power is coming this last day amen to unite you to the word pray to unite the church amen to the word the promise that we see the nations uniting we see the world uniting we see the churches uniting we see the bride uniting with the word amen why the word is god he meant the word his god as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union they unite like a wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding they become one the word becomes you are you hearing me now the word becomes you and you become the word that's why jesus said oh that the father is i am and all i am you are and all you are i am and in that day you'll know that i am in the father and the father is in me and i you and you and me he said see at that day what day this day we've been looking for the day that that scripture would be fulfilled and a prophet comes along and says you're putting it in the future it's not a future day coming it's the day you're living in old church of the living god you're not going to live in a day when the word is united with humanity you are living in the day when the word has united with humanity once again the same logos a man that anointed a party and manifested john 1 14 is the same logos and is manifested itself in this age in a many-membered body called the bride he said what day amen this day see we find out the great hidden mysteries of god being revealed in other words amen the revelation of the hidden mysteries amen will restore the church the revelation of the hidden mysteries will restore the church to the former or to the to the original condition to the pentecostal message with the pentecostal faith with the pentecostal sign where the pentecostal evidence the true revelation will restore the church and then now when you begin to look at restoration you know the prophet preaches a message called the restoration of the bride tree and in there he will say amen that there is a law of restoration he said like if somebody stole some property and they're holding that property captive amen then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces now watch this amen who does this the law forces amen or enforces this person to restore the property back to its natural owner to its first estate he said see it is enforcement amen watch this what a privilege then it is amen to the pride of jesus christ to be able to enforce amen restoration claims amen do you realize that you are amen in the beginning you was in the mind of god amen before the fall i heard him say this morning he said before the foundations of the world was laid he said god had already called you he had already chose you he already elected you to live in the age that you're living in amen see then the law of the spirit of god amen is to enforce amen restoration claims amen genesis 1 27 the bible said that god had been created man in his own image in the image of god created he him amen male and female created he them now i want you to catch a word there it is the word create it amen in the beginning god created amen in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth genesis 1 27 god created man he created man in his own image he created male and female created he them the prophet said the law of the spirit of god is to force satan amen to give up that which he is unrightfully and deceitfully taken from god amen the souls of men he took from god the souls of women amen children sickness of the body he placed upon the people where god made man in his image to be like him amen the church somebody shot the church and if the church is given the rightful legal right and then by the bible to take the holy spirit and enforce them upon them amen you have been given the legal rights by redemption to enforce the claims of restoration upon whatever the devil has stole from the church amen i don't know if you all heard this term or not amen there's actually a term called on the right side of the law amen do you realize there's the right side of the law and there is the wrong side of the law do you realize people live their whole lives on the wrong side of the law they're always fearing the law they're always fearing amen they've done something wrong or they stole something amen and they're always fearing that it's going to catch up with them they're living on the wrong side of the law amen but when you move to the right side of the law amen that means amen that someone is not living the life of a criminal and then they're not they're not living as a criminal they're not acting as a criminal they've been they've been moved to the right side of the law amen and for years he'd been the church of the living god amen was living as a bunch of people who didn't know their rights they didn't know where they come from they didn't know if they had the power to cast out therefore they didn't know if they had the power to speak to storms they didn't know if they had the power to pray for the sick and they would recover amen but god would send a message of restoration that would take the church amen from the wrong side of the law to the right side of the law amen not with the law against them amen but the law for them amen in other words amen to fall in the garden put us on the wrong side of the law he meant before the fall man had dominion over every creeping thing over ever fell in the air amen he had he had dominion over nature amen but after the fall amen nature had dominion over him and he was afraid of every creeping thing and he ran from everything amen but the bible says amen i will restore unto you amen he will restore unto the church amen the power that the devil took through the fall [Applause] well lord according to truth anyhow amen in other words amen before the fall in the garden you was on the right side of the law you was on the side of faith he was on the side of belief he was on the side of righteousness he was on the side of holiness he was on the side of purity he'd been through the fall of god and he moved man to the wrong side of the law and put him on the law on the side of law of science the father said but lord after you raised from the dead 1900 years ago and there you made a promise that we would see you in the last days that you would do this very thing and here you come around tonight right before my eyes in this intellectual age this scientific age and break every law of science and break everything the critics have said and come right down among us he meant to prove that you are raised from the dead on glory to god church don't you see what this message was it was the message of restoration to take the church amen from the side of the law of science he went back into the wall of faith back into the law of the life of god well glory to god amen the prophet said see it breaks every law of science the word of god when the prophet preaches god talked to moses he said see in the last days amen there will be a god we today are god's spiritual church now i want you to hear this we are god's spiritual church with a spiritual law somebody say that back at me spiritual law with our god spiritual church with a spiritual law now where is this law at it's written on the tables of our heart and brother we are being led in a spiritual form we are god's spiritual church with a spiritual law that is written on the tables of our hearts were being led in a spiritual form in other words the message of the hour amen has restored the church to the right side of the law amen the prophet of god said the only way he can work is when you let him work amen the only way he can work is when you let him work amen you've got to believe there is a law do you know a fish has a law do you realize a fish has a law the promise that that fish can stand up here in water but he has a law within him if he'll just let go amen the law that's in him he can sink plum to the bottom of the sea and it won't bother him a bit it won't break oneself but if you try to do it he said the law is not in you you cannot do it but it is in the fish amen he deflates himself with the air and he can go there's nothing in him to burst open see he's made that way he knows it and he can enforce that law he may not listen to taking plum to the bottom of the sea and then raising back up again amen the problem god said see there is a law and a fish now come on if you go get in the water and your head's above water and all of a sudden you take a notion you're going to go to the bottom and you try to do it the way the fist does it it won't be very long they'll be sending the search team after you amen because the law is not in you amen the law is not in you to go the bottom and come back up amen but it is in the fish to go the bottom of the sea and to rise back to the top well let's not leave it there amen the prophet said and there is a law that was in christ and that law is in you that law that was in christ was in you he said you can bear him in the deepest grave or the deepest sea or the lowest tail but there is a law of the spirit of god that will raise him back up again glory to god are you all hearing me amen i just amen you wonder why you're still here when you work with people who's been through the same things you've been through and they're not serving god today you go to school with people who face the same situations that you faced in your life amen but they're not in the house of god on sunday morning with their hands raised i'll tell you why it's because for all that's in you is not in them but the law that is in you amen says you can bury us but will rise again you can push us down but god will pull us up you can kick us out but god will put us back in you can scandalize our name amen but god who is rich in mercy will raise the church from the lowest pitch to the highest palace come on joseph amen before you can sit in the palace you got to go in the pit but from the pit you're on your way to the palace hello church there was a law that was in joseph that wasn't in the rest of their it says do whatever you want to us but we'll rise again there was a law of christ that law is in man you realize a bird has a law the prophet said now to it he said its body is its material it's earthbound it sits here but there's a law within it he said that it spreads it wings it can fly plumb out of sight he said that's against science amen notice this they claim that it's earthbound evergreen gravitation has to hold it here but it can defy gravitation it can lift itself right off of it and go right on amen because it has the law in it it's built to possess a law the fish is built to possess a law he meant the bird is built to possess a law do you realize you amen were built to possess a law in john 1 12 the bible says as many as received him to them gave he the power he meant to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name remember now i'm beginning to feel religious now we have a law and that is the law of life that is in us you are made and born and placed here in the body of christ as sons and daughters of god you don't have to knock down to the devil amen what are you trying to say preacher but can i can i can i break it down to you in plain terms the law is on your side no you all didn't catch that amen the law is on your side amen no he still didn't get it the law is on your side amen i remember i remember as a young boy we lived in well i say we live my grandfather had a shop and there was some people lived up the road from his shop and up the road they were amen they was a rough bunch of people i tell you they mean they'd steal they'd do all kinds of things amen you know what one day they did something i looked at my grandfather i said well pap amen just call the law and just call the police he said it won't do no good to call the police i said why not he said cause the police is on their side he said the police will stand with him even though we even though we've got evidence they've done wrong oh god i want to tell you this morning church amen you right now don't have to knock down to the devil who has come in your home and stole the atmosphere of the holy ghost who has stole your children who will stole your husband who is still your wife who is trying to steal your health who is trying to steal your family you don't have to cut down to the devil anymore right here this morning you can call the law of that day it's not the minneapolis police department it's the holy ghost and the holy ghost will show up and he will enforce even the laws of restoration you may fight with the devil trying to pry your children out of this hand trying to buy your retirement out of his head just call the law this morning [Applause] [Music] jesus christ [Applause] [Music] oh it's not against you the law is for you i'm on church you got the law showed up are y'all hearing me you all got the law showed up it's snug but i'm preach the law's on your side brother hearing trying to andrew this boy of mine's running away from god but the law is on your side you've got the right this morning amen to call the dispatch of heaven and say my son is running from god and the holy ghost will be dispatched from the presence of god and he will find that son and that old filthy devil may try to hold on to it but the law will say satan you got to take your hands home because before you put your [Applause] [Music] he is he probably said no my you don't have to knock down the law or to the devil we've got the law the law of the holy spirit the only thing you know you have to do is know how to let go and let god right there's a thing you gotta let go and let god you've pleaded your case now let go and let god and i preach this morning amen somebody breaks in your house and you know who done it they live across the street so you call the law and the law comes to your house and the law says who does it and you say them people cross the street down it they said what did they do you tell them they broke in the wind and they broke in the front door they stole this that and the other amen you give them your report you tell them everything that's been done and when you get done talking you know what they say they'll say we'll take it from here you know what you've just done you just committed the entire situation into the hands of the law to let them take control of the situation well come on church amen and god has come down this morning they meant to take control of the situations of our lives and that we can talk about it we can cry about it or we can let go and let god have his way in the situation the prophet said you keep fighting at it and it won't never work when you let go and let god he can go to work that's all and then you operate the law you should matter how do i operate the law you operate the law by letting go and letting god the fish don't try to work it out the lord put a law in him he lets go and the law that's in him takes him to the bottom and the same law that takes him to the bottom is the same law that brings him to the top even the bird don't try to take off running and get enough speed to lift himself off the ground and then the law that's hit him by god he lets go and he lets the wind of the air take a hold of his wings and lift him into the heavens and come on sons and daughters of god you've been trying to work it out you've been trying to figure it out amen but god this morning is saying let go and let the law that's on the inside of you amen lift you into heavenly places but probably said see it's the same way with us we fight and we pull and we hurry and oh if i don't get pissed if i don't get past that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let god amen see you just let go somebody say let go come on help me let go and let god see he said let go and let god he said now watch when you let go and you let god then he takes you to the baptism of the spirit he takes you to your healing or anything that he's promised any claim that he's given amen is yours by letting go and letting god you say andrew is a human i've got to do something well let me tell you what james said if you really want to do something let me say this there's nothing you can do to help god in your situation a prophet said you've got to let go and let god but if you really really want something to do let me tell you what you can do you can resist the devil and he will flee from you and then while you're waiting on your answer from god when you've committed it to god and the devil comes along and says he didn't hear your prayer and he's not going to answer your petition amen there is an anointing upon you he meant to resist that lying dead amen and say devil i resist you in the name of jesus christ the prominent god said to resist is just simply turn him down amen and let him go oh god just turn him down amen just resist him that's it just walk away from it amen notice this then your ears become death to anything that he says and you only hear what the spirit says well glory to god are y'all hearing me this morning you become deaf to everything the devil says and the only thing you're hearing is what the spirit says and what is the spirit saying this morning the spirit is saying it's yours it's time to claim it your family is going to be saved your church is going to be raptured your mind is not going to leave you your health is not going to fit are y'all hearing me it's the spirit of god operating the law of god in the church of god he said see that's what catches the spirit and it says amen to the church it's going to be okay amen david said commit thy ways unto god in other words david said commit thy ways and let go and let god amen in other words you say it put it into god's hands anybody here this morning got anything you need to put in god's hands you've been holding your hands for a long time and nothing's changing ain't meant nothing's getting any better you know what you need to do you need to put it into god's hands you need to rest your case in the hands of the law of god you need to say god i've gone as far as i can go i've done as much as i can do from this day forward i'm placing this impossibility into the hands of a man who said with me nothing shall be impossible with me all things are possible a committal is to let go and let god amen put it into god's hands in second timothy 1 12 the bible says this which calls also we suffer these things amen nevertheless i am not ashamed amen for i know in whom i have believed and am persuaded somebody shout persuaded that he is able to keep those things which i have committed unto him against that day in the book of first peter 4 19 amen i want you to catch the scripture okay the bible says wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god now you should be there to suffer according to the will of god are you actually saying that my sufferings are according to the will of god that's exactly what peter was saying i didn't say that amen but peter said that he said that we suffer sometimes according to the will of god amen but commit the keeping of their souls amen to him in well-doing now listen to this as unto a faithful creator amen commit thy souls unto him as unto a faithful creator in other words what he's saying amen is whatever you're going through amen you don't have to commit it to a prophet or commit it to a pastor or committed to a preacher amen you've got the right by the law to commit it into a faithful creator are you hearing me this morning even can i say it like this in other words the law is on your side and the creator is on your side no y'all didn't hear that i said the law is on your side and the creator is on your side whatever you're going through this morning with full assurance i announce to you today you're going to get through it because the creator is on your side you say the creator oh yes amen when you're serving the creator he is on your side there are no impossibilities to a creator [Music] there are no impossibilities amen to a creator there are no impossibilities to agree i'm preaching to you now there are no impossibilities to a creator what are you talking about i'm saying you're serving the god who stepped out on nothing and created everything you're serving the god he said let there be son let there be a moon let there be waters let there be impermanence let the waters be separated from the land let there be light and let the darkness be separated well glory to god it's the truth anyhow and y'all hear me this morning he is a creator and he is on your side he is in the church he is in our midst he is here to bless he is here to heal he is here to move he is here to change he is the faithful creator come on abraham will testify you want to abraham was obeying god when god said take your son isaac upon the mountain and slay him and abraham obeyed god and went up on the mountain and when he got up there he had a knife in his hand now now i just have to be honest with you amen isaac was old enough to know the order of worship he had been up on the mountain too many times and he had seen the order of worship or y'all hear me this morning he went up on the mountain and when he got up there and then he laid isaac down on the altar and isaac knew there was no sacrifice that came with him to church that morning amen i wonder sometimes brother i've often wondered when did it strike isaac's mind you are the sacrifice when did it come into isaac's heart i'm the one that he's going to sacrifice but before he left in the back of isaac's mind he was rehearsing the words of his father i and my lad will go yonder in worship but we will return unto you in other words abraham said i don't know what's going to happen but the god who told me to take him up on the mountain is a creator he is a resurrector he is a life-giver he is a problem changer he is the answer to our question and abraham obey god he committed his soul unto god and he walked upon the mountain you don't think abraham suffered he was suffering according to the will of god and he walked isaac up on the mountain and he got isaac up there and just about the time he went to take isaac's life he heard a noise behind him and he looked around and there was a ram that was caught in the picket the prophet said it was not a vision he said because he killed the ram and the ram blade he said what happened was the creator created a ram for abraham in his time of need oh god church amen listen friends right when abraham didn't know what else to do but obey god and lay isaac up on the altar the creator come on the scene and made a way for isaac to leah you want to go on our day let's go to our day you want to it's a lady named hattie wright anybody ever heard of hattie wright do you realize what hattie wright was doing she was listening to the testimonies of creation power how that a prophet spoke squirrels into existence and as heidi was hearing the testimony of creation power amen something struck her heart to say that ain't nothing but the truth and when she said that the prophet looked at her and said hattie write you said the right thing and the lord god spoke to my heart and said tell her whatever she asked for are y'all hearing me this morning whatever she asks for i will give it to her if she asks for a million dollars i'll give her a million dollars if she asks for the healing of her of her sister edith i'll give her the healing of her sister whatever she asks you'll give it to her the prophet said i had to know that jehovah was on the scene he said cause i had no ability he meant to produce money if she would ask for money i had no ability to produce healing in her sister's body she asked for her healing of her sister he said but right there hattie rat looked at me and said brother branham i've got two teenage boys and they've got that rebellious teenage stage and they're running from god he said then hattie what are you asking for she said i desire the salvation of my two boys [Applause] she said i desire the salvation of my two voice do you realize them two boys was on the other side of the wall they were laughing at the prophet of god they were laughing at the testimonies of creation power amen brother one where was the power going to come amen to break the strongholds of rebellion over those two boys brother branham wasn't going to figure it out you know why he meant because the creator was on his side the creator was at his side and right there in the face of impossibility he looked at those two boys or looked at hattie rather and he said hattie i give you those two boys what are you saying preacher amen brother branham didn't go over there and lay a desire in their heart to serve god he didn't lay his hands on them and he didn't go lay her hands on them what happened i'll tell you what happened the creator who created a ram for isaac abraham [Applause] is in this church [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] under god as the faithful creator amen how many has ever heard of a brother named brother joe green he pastors a church down to rutherford to north carolina hosted many missionary camp meetings but joel greene made a statement one time i never forget it he said it like this he said martin luther said one time he said i've healed many things in my hands and i've lost them all but whatever i've placed in god's hands that i still possess everything these hands have held i've washed it all but everything i've taken out of my head and placed into god's hands i still possess yes then do you realize whose hands you're placing it in your place in hand that has your name engraved in the palms of them john 10 27 my sheep hear my voice and the voice is the word and i know them and they follow me the prophet said in other words they will not understand the theological voice that's teaching contrary to the word in verse 28 i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hands my father which gave them me is greater than all right and no man is able to plug this out of my father's hand you know what that word pluck means it means to claim for oneself eagerly in other words jesus christ himself said amen there's no devil gonna be able to lay a claim upon my children and fulfill that claim because the reason i can enforce redemption claim is because the abstract was put in my hand with a nail at calvary and there ain't no dead hor amen can take away my sons and bones [Applause] my father gave them unto me you realize revelation 1 20 the bible says there is a mystery of seven stars which thou saw swear in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saw and start the seven church ages now watch this for the seven churches now do you realize in his right hand amen was that candlestick which was seven angel messengers which we know to be paul martin columbus amen are you hearing me now all those seven aged messengers amen was in the hand of god now you say but andrew no wonder they can make it because they was held in the right hand of god which was a symbol denoting his authority but the prophet said not only can we speak flesh for the messengers but every true believer how many true believers shall we god here but every true believer is dramatically depicted here they are all drawing from the same source they have all been dipped in the same bowl they are dead themselves and their lives are here with christ in god they are sealed in by the holy ghost no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tampered with the visible life is burning and shining giving light and manifestations of the holy ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in god and fed by the lord's word satan oh hear me now satan cannot touch them satan cannot touch them not even death can touch them for death has lost its sting the grave has lost its victory and thanks be to god they have this victory through our lord jesus christ amen in other words he's saying there's a group of people coming up on the earth who no matter what you put them through they're not going to become lukewarm by the trials they're going through yeah can i have some liberty here no matter what you put this blind through she will not become lukewarm you can put her through a sudden death i'm a church member but she'll still praise god you can put her through a bad damage but you'll still praise god you can put them through political disturbances but they'll still praise god are y'all hearing me let's let the devil know this morning satan you don't have enough amen to cause me to become lukewarm what are you saying i'm saying i'll serve him when the church is on fire we'll serve him when the church is cold we'll serve him when the bank is full we'll serve him when the bank is empty we'll serve him in the basement when the bills are paid we'll survey when the bills are moved there's something about this bride she has been restored to the right side of the law and there's nothing the devil can do he meant to turn her off of her convictions are you hearing me somebody shot a man and then the bible says because they aren't lukewarm amen look what this what means it's the condition of the soul amen which is ritually fluctuating amen between a sluggish and a fervor of love amen in other words this lay out a sin church age whatever they go through changes their temperature of their love towards god brother thank you for the randoms for coming along and clarifying to the church amen that the signs of god's approval is not in sunny skies and the signs of god's disapproval it's not in cloudy skies hey are y'all hearing me amen i i we woke up this morning i woke up and i looked out the window and the sun was shining man it was bright i mean it was bright sun it was a beautiful sunrise amen bro one it wasn't a few minutes and the clouds covered the sun and the bright sun went away in the clouds covering the sky and brother brother something down in my heart amen just said thank god i conditioned a servant god ain't like that but if i woke up on sunday morning and the sun would shine i was going to church but watch how quick the conditions change in a few minutes the cloud rolled in amendment if there was clouds or sun or rain or snow i was still going to the house of god even because nature doesn't control who is controlled by the things of god [Music] but i'll get back up [Music] [Applause] he said see furthermore if we'll just keep the word in mind you will recall that nowhere does it say we are in the mouth of god we are engraved we're in his palms we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages are y'all hear me now before time we were in his mind we are in his sheet forth amen in his pastures but never in his mouth see that is what's wrong with the people last day they have gotten away from the word and they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it see in other words they will not overcome how many knows that each age had conditions that had to be overcome that's right amen the ephesian age that thy tyranny all the ages had conditions even up to the leona sin age there was a condition had to be overcome and i know i touched a little bit last night but i want to labor here for a second it was the condition of being lukewarm now do you realize that each church age had overcomers no matter how bad the penalty was no matter how dark the thing of sin was in that age there were still people who was elected to overcome the election they changed was the overcomers of the age by receiving the word for the age they overcome the conditions of the age by receiving the word promise for the age you realize that only the elected of the of the age in laodicea will overcome the lukewarmness of this age paul says this and breaking in romans 9 11 that the purpose of god according to election might stand in first thessalonians 1 4 it says no one brethren beloved amen that your election is of god look at what this the word election means it means the chosen it means used to the act of god's free will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed his blessings to certain persons now i love how brotherhood says this he said if i didn't believe in election i would be discouraged testing one two it's still working if i didn't believe in election i would be discouraged if you are discouraged this morning it's time to check your election yeah [Music] if i didn't believe in election i'd be discouraged listen friends if i didn't believe in election i'd be discouraged at the signs of america if i didn't believe in election i'd be discouraged at the conditions of the churches amen but because i know i've been elected from before the foundation from what god placed in me in eternity before the foundation of the world the prophet said watch that church elect he said you've got to believe in election if you believe in the bible he said oh my we are elected by god amen by his poor knowledge yeah he elected us now you want something to be thankful for here's a direct quote you ought to be thankful to god that you was elected that's why i'm so thankful about that god called me thank you jesus it shows me he elected me you never chose him let me say this the god that elected you was the alpha and the omega he is the beginning and he is the end and you realize the prophet says emphatically that god knows the end from the beginning he knows the end from the beginning the beginning of genesis before he wrote the first word in genesis 1 1 he knew that amen in the last chapter of revelation before he healed god before the 7 7 gentile ages he knew the end age was coming let me say this god knows the end from the beginning can i drop this to you and everything in between [Applause] he knows the end [Music] between ephesus and laodicea going to god the only god enough room up here for me to preach hey y'all

god in the beginning oh god can i have a few more minutes brother in the beginning he called himself the creator in the end he says he is the beginning of the creation of god he said this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of the church listen to this the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride heavenly bridegroom created his home right in other words the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride that was going to overcome his enemy as the spirit of god he came down and created the virgin of mary the cells from

we are created where in union with christ jesus praise the lord oh god help me to get this off my heart this new creation is not an old one made over it is exactly what he says that he is it is a new creation but now somebody shout now out of every kindred and tribe and nation he is purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of a man now by his spirit he has created many sons unto himself god the creator created himself a part of his creation this true revelation of god was his promise are you all ready for this somebody shout amen if you are this purpose took form through election yeah oh y'all didn't catch that you'll catch at about 12 o'clock tomorrow and scare everybody to death at work this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last stage when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of the creation of god no no let me let me try to make sense of this if i can he's sitting there we'll say in ephesus and he's looking all the way over to leonisia and when he looks at laodicea he sees himself he looks all the way into the dark stage of seven ages and sees himself and says that he that overcomes will i grant to sit with me in my throne as i sit with my father in his throne and sends a prophet to preach a message how can i overcome i'm on church i'm closer now god was not worried about having overcomers the creator created himself a bride my old church brings about melchizedek let's talk about this he came down and created a body and stepped into that body and met abraham and served his victorious child amen communion after the battle in the laodicean church age a prophet comes and preaches a message who is this melchizedek in other words in the darkest of seven ages melchizedek has returned into his bride the creator has returned to his creation right and it's not you getting to leona see you it's the creator himself in you that's getting you through lay out a seat when you come up against something and you don't how you're going to get through it that's why the father said we don't know the word retreat because the creator don't retreat the creator create the creator don't retreat the creator creates do you realize today in closing we're sailing in the ship the problem god said one time he said the disciples have been over in a meeting with jesus and he said after the meeting was over he said jesus got on the ship and he went back in the back of the boat you all heard the story goes back there and he says he lays down to take a little rest and he said the disciples brother they they push off the shore for the arrow he says and they're so excited about what they've just seen done he says they begin to testify he said i could hear andrew say what about it when he talked to the woman at the well he said i can hear i can hear phillip and the thing that began to talk about when he come down there and called him by name in john 1. he said they're all excited he said and all of a sudden while they're sailing across the across the waters he said having a testimony meeting on the sea he said one one brother spoke up he said i believe it was young john spoke up and young john said oh brothers said what was it like when we stood there that day and we saw a little boy who had skipped school come over by the meeting and 5 000 people standing there and jesus said he was going to feed him and he didn't have no food oh god and the young boy come over there and gave jesus his little lunch of two fish and five loaves of bread and young john said do you remember when he stood there and he took that in his hands he said do you remember the feeling you had when you saw him take that little bit and multiply it and feed 5000 men and their wives and their children oh god and brother i'm saying here with the disciples scream out he's a creator he's a creator oh god y'all hear me this morning screamed out he's a creator he said he said about that time he said about that time the ship began to rock the wind began to blow the rains begin to fall he sent them them semen he said that men who were lived on the sea he said they were called sea men he said they knew how to get through storms he said but this was one storm they didn't know what to do about he said everything they were doing was failing yeah that's right oh god everything they were trying was failing he said they tried to lower the the oars that failed they tried to lower the anchor that failed he said they tried to raise the helm that failed he said everything they were trying to do was failing he said then all of a sudden he said it struck young john's heart amen the god that created the heavens and earth the god that spoke the world into existence the god that took five fish and two loaves of bread is the god that's on this ship the creator of the heavens and the earth is on the ship i'm on church they were trying to correct they were trying to control the wind but the creator of the wind was on the ship they were trying to control the water but the creator of the water was on the ship they were trying to control the nature but the creator of nature was on the ship the greatest weapon in their storm that night was when those disciples began to scream out these words somebody go wait jesus somebody go wait for creator we've done all we [Music] can do [Applause] john start walking back there he gets back there he maybe maybe knocks on the door he opens the door and there lays jesus he said jesus jesus can you come here can you come here remember something wake up kind of stretch he walks out the door and he looks around he says what's going on said he knew what was going on he knew what was going on because he was the one brother who said let us go unto the other side he knew the end yeah right he knew the ends right come on church he knew that end was going to be in for maniac of godard the beginning was at the end of that revival he knew the storm was coming but he knew oh god he knew that there was nothing between them better not do that and he looks out there at the wind and now this is just me okay i can imagine the wind looked at him and the wind thought i've seen them eyes before [Music] he looked up at the rain cloud and the rain cloud said oh god you are god [Applause] i've seen them [Music] [Applause] peace [Applause] [Music] he said the creator was with the disciples listen friends he's been god above us he's been god with us but let me say this [Applause] the creator is not just above us today and the creator is not just selling with us today creator [Applause] [Music] oh god it don't matter god i'm trying to quit it don't matter what man has done to you when the creator is on your side oh praise the lord somebody give thanks [Applause] the creator has returned to his creation [Music] the world is shaking to the purpose of god that took forward through election hallelujah mercy the prophet god said god's spirit is moving here to counteract the demons that are working on every hand what is it get on god's side and be right in your heart amen praise the lord the creator said that there'd be a rapture the creator said let there be a resurrection the creator in you is in you this morning can i can i can i tell you this it don't matter what man's done to you that's right it don't matter what man is doing to you it don't matter what man will do to you since because the creator is on your side the prophet of god said if god in that could speak to the wind and creation had to obey the creator he said that how much more with the creator coming in your body he said you speak to your condition and he said your body will have to obey the creator that's right hey y'all y'all know brother ron spencer up here ready rod spitzer i studied this in the neighborhood and i come across a quote you all know brother ron he's facing he's battling right now stage four cancer spread through his lungs and his brain and i was studying this message of the day and brother thomas i read a quote where brother graham said he said if the creator is in your body he said then that cancer was not created in your body he said that cancer is a trespasser on your body that's right he said but the creator that created your body has got legal rights to speak to that cancer he said actually he'll use your voice to speak to that cancer and say cancer dry up in the name of jesus christ and it's these are the words he used he said the cancer case will have to itself because the creator yes has passed judgment on hallelujah friends i'm telling you this morning you're going to overcome leonisia praise the lord calls the creator hallelujah it's on your side amen you know sometimes things happen to us it's way out of our control you know that there's things that will happen to us that we're we were trusting somebody to help us yes trusting somebody to help us and in reality they hurt us i want to share this with you and i'm done i promise there's just a wonderful atmosphere in here this morning i said brother brother lloyd was brother of michael's brother down in richmond i was out there preaching of the night listening cracker bro having supper before church and brother lloyd began to share some stuff with us brother juan he began to tell us how that his wife sister paula had been having been having trouble breathing for years he said brother andrew he said he said they thought it was asthma he said and for years they've been treated as asthma he said to the day it got real bad so we took her to the doctor and he said brother he said we went in there he said the doctor did all kinds of scans the doctor said well we found your problem it's called a paralyzed diaphragm he said what he said a paralyzed diaphragm he said what happened was years ago you had a surgery and she said yeah i had a rotator cuff surgery he said well the anesthesiologist that did the anesthesia he said when they went in they hit their own part of the body and when they hit that part of the body it paralyzed your diaphragm he said so for all these years your diaphragm has been hanging down over your lung and he said putting the pressure there that you feel like you can't breathe he said it's not asthma it's a paralyzed diaphragm inflicted by a surgery that a doctor made a mistake a man made a mistake now i'm not i'm not preaching against medical science now okay don't take it that way but these are the words he said brother juan he said there's nothing really we can do for you he said we're sorry but the only thing we could possibly do is go in there and cut open and lift the diaphragm up and try to sew it to something to hold it off the lung just to get a little bit of relief to breathe but other than that we don't it can't be fixed it's beyond repair and brother what brother lloyd was telling me that in the back of my mind i was sitting in a meeting a few years ago brother wayne lawson and i was preaching a meeting and at the end that meeting brother wayne began to tell a testimony about his wife's grandmother who actually was in brother ramsey's meetings in jonesborough arkansas where the brand came there and what happened was years after that she went and had a surgery it was a shoulder surgery she went and had a surgery come out the doctors told her go to therapy she went to therapy and the doctor come to spot the physical therapist said you know you've gone as far as you can go and brother after she had the surgery she could only raise her arm this high this is as high as it could go she can never fully raise it she could raise this arm up all over her head but this is as high as this one could go and they couldn't figure out what was wrong for years and finally one day she went to the doctor she went there she said doc i'm not going to sue you i'm not i'm not looking for money i'm just wanting to know what happened what what caused my arm to be in this condition he said well man i hate to tell you he said but during the surgery we made a mistake and he said we clipped the nerve and when we clipped that nerve he said we tried our best to fix it there's no way it can be repaired he said it's always going to be that way you'll never be able to raise your arm any higher than that he said we're sorry she said i'm not going to sue you i just wanted to know what was happening he said now brother wayne said like this he said she went to she went home and was listening to a tape and she heard brother branham say that they can send a man to the moon and they can't figure out the life that's in a blade of grass he said they can send a man to the moon and they cannot figure out the life that's in the blade of grass she heard that tape she went to the to a garage sale got out of her car and looked at the blade of grass and said i just heard a prophet say they cannot figure out how the blade of grass has life but they can send the man to the moon she said brother brother wayne told like this he said when she said that she said but god created the life in that blade of grass and when she said that she said praise the lord i believe it was like this praise lord and for the first time she lifted this arm to praise god and raised the other one just fine the doctor said the nerve was clipped the arm would never be raised again but listen friends the creator of the body was inside of him it didn't matter what man the creator was on the inside i'm on church and there may be people sitting here today who has been damaged by preachers you've been damaged by husbands you've been damaged by families you've been damaged by churches you've been damaged by situations but hear my heart

christmas weekend i was preaching the mercy child verb graham says uh your natural birth is more mysterious than the virgin birth that's what i was preaching that night and as i was preaching the lord took over the service for some reason there was a pause i was in the middle of preaching but there was a pause and and i said [Music] might think that this is your last service you might have middle your mind that this meeting will be your last meeting in church and when i said that it's on tech something went across the building just like that it happened to be the pastor son's wife father came from abusive an abusive church so he just stayed that weekend because he had decided after this meeting i'm done with this message [Music] oh [Music] god and the holy spirit moved in that meeting that moved it was just like a loch ness that struck that man every birth of a child of god is supernatural we might sit in church and come to church and come to church just stay in the atmosphere praise the lord when the world brings a birth to you is going to be above anything you have honestly anything that you can explain because every birth of a child of god is supernatural [Music] yes sir praise the lord after the service the brother came to me in the office he was so nervous an elderly man he said brother one i don't know what happened but i thank god for this service and i believe that's
