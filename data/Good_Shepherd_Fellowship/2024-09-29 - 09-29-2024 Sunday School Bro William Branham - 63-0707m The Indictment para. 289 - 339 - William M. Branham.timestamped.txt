[10:10] see you do a miracle Master we would
[10:13] desire a miracle from you whenever day

[10:33] reason why had to get him out of their
[10:34] midst yes sir they're trying to do the
[10:36] same thing today and through the
[10:37] Federation of churches they'll finally
[10:39] accomplish to do it all of them going
[10:41] The Familiar old crime here we see again
[10:44] the most religious place the best
[10:46] polished theologians calling out again
[10:50] and against him calling out the very
[10:53] best theologians which ought to know
[10:55] different the very highest churches and
[10:58] best trained theologians cast him out of
[11:00] their midst they don't want it you say

[11:15] in they cast him out because they
[11:17] haven't got no use for him they crucify
[11:20] him aresh amen how long could we go
[11:25] remember the prophet of God's word foret
[11:28] told us in second Timothy 3 if you're
[11:31] writing it down we haven't got time to
[11:32] read it but said that in the last days
[11:35] scoffers would come they'd be heady
[11:38] highminded
[11:39] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[11:41] God false accusers incontinent
[11:44] Fierce and despisers of those that are
[11:47] good tray headyy highminded
[11:51] scholarly having a farm of godliness but
[11:54] denying the power thereof from such turn
[11:57] away for this is a sort that takes s
[11:59] bobbed haired women short wearing
[12:02] painted faces from place to place lead
[12:04] them captive exactly he said turn away
[12:08] from it in the last days let's obey the
[12:10] prophet turn away from those things in
[12:13] the last days they here I'm calling to
[12:16] the church now yes sir get away from it
[12:19] they have they the the Ministers of this
[12:22] day should know these things they should
[12:24] have know Jesus in his days they should
[12:27] have know it now they should know it
[12:30] but they don't know it just as the
[12:32] Jewish teachers of his days should have
[12:35] known him by his day so is it today of
[12:38] God's clearly Vindicated word Dan he was
[12:41] the word and he proved he was the word
[12:45] he proved he was the word for that
[12:48] day and God is proven today that he's
[12:51] the word of this day the light of the
[12:53] hour and they should have known it then
[12:55] and they should know it Now They
[12:57] Crucified him then and they crucify him
[12:59] now I and D him of it right just keeps
[13:03] flashing through me and D him cuz God's
[13:06] going to make them pay for
[13:09] it the Jews of their days God again in
[13:12] the days on Earth Jesus said Jerusalem
[13:16] Jerusalem how off would I have gathered
[13:19] you in one great big group but you would
[13:23] not how God has tried in his last days
[13:25] and unite his people together you would
[13:28] not you've desired your Creed so now
[13:31] you're given over to destruction that's
[13:33] what Jerusalem received she is tore down
[13:36] burned down she's no more and that's
[13:39] exactly what will be some of these days
[13:41] to all these big things your your big
[13:43] Creeds and denominations will die and
[13:45] perish but the word of God will be
[13:47] Eternal and live
[13:49] forever amen his deepest wounds come
[13:53] from the house of so-called
[13:56] friends think think of it
[13:59] think of
[14:03] it stop I'm waiting a
[14:07] minute ministers think of it where did
[14:11] his wounds come from the house of his
[14:14] so-call
[14:16] friends as it was so is
[14:20] it think of it at Calvary he wasn't
[14:23] surrounded by by Savages
[14:27] barbarians but of ministers who claim to
[14:30] love him and today when the gospel is
[14:34] Thoroughly
[14:35] identified when the Great Signs of his
[14:37] resurrection is proven Among
[14:41] Us it isn't the street out there that
[14:43] jumps on you it's the so-called
[14:47] ministers them exposed to love him is
[14:50] what he's surrounded by today we will
[14:52] not have that thing among us we'll not
[14:54] have this man rule over us we'll not
[14:56] support we'll have no cooperation about
[14:58] that in this C if that thing comes this
[15:00] way it's nothing but spiritualism it's
[15:02] the devil not knowing the word of God
[15:05] the blind leading the blind as it was
[15:08] then think so is it now just as it was
[15:12] then so is it now think his power to
[15:15] heal and to set man and woman free from
[15:18] the love of this present World from the
[15:21] bobbed haired painted Facey Jezebels
[15:24] that calls themselves
[15:26] Christians and producing such a life as
[15:29] that cigarettes smoking dirty joke
[15:32] telling sit down and have a missionary
[15:35] society and Stitch and sew and talk and
[15:37] Scandal and and get out on the street
[15:39] and wear shorts and everything like that
[15:41] and then call themselves Christians
[15:43] before other women that's right you
[15:45] remember my story about the slave
[15:46] knowing he was a son of a king his
[15:49] character what art we to
[15:52] be man and women and deny these
[15:56] clergymen these pull pits where he gets
[15:58] his Pierces
[15:59] they put up and endorse that kind of
[16:01] living amongst the people where they
[16:04] piercing they deny the power to to set
[16:07] them free from it and they endorse it to
[16:09] be so when it's a contrary to the word
[16:12] of God for a woman to Bob her hair or to
[16:15] paint her face or to wear
[16:18] shorts It's contrary to the word of God
[16:21] but they endorse
[16:22] it making another Calvary from where
[16:26] from the street from the barroom from
[16:29] the
[16:30] pulpit amen
[16:32] pulpit and again what was the cry He
[16:35] makes himself
[16:37] God they denies his deity they try to
[16:40] split him up make three or four Gods out
[16:41] of him when he is God he was God he'll
[16:46] always be God the same yesterday today
[16:49] and forever when you talk about one God
[16:51] to them they laugh at you we believe in
[16:53] a Holy Trinity I believe in one holy
[16:57] God hallelujah his power to heal to set
[17:02] free and take these people out of the
[17:04] love of the world to free
[17:07] them like it did Mary magdalina remember
[17:11] she was a little painted up Jezebel too
[17:13] she had Seven Devils in her she's a
[17:16] strip
[17:17] teas just like the modern woman on the
[17:19] street today go anywhere you want to
[17:21] look if you won believe people bows it's
[17:22] a shrine of naked women look out on the
[17:24] street today as it was in the days of
[17:26] Sodom so shall it be look out if you
[17:28] don't believe it just anywhere open up a
[17:29] paper open up a magazine look at a
[17:31] billboard why are you find amen remember
[17:35] what it said when the sons of God saw
[17:36] the daughters of man was faroh they
[17:38] taken un them
[17:39] women look at the scandal in England
[17:41] look at the Scandal here look at the
[17:43] whole Things become a house of
[17:44] prostitution yes why is it why did
[17:47] Russia become communism because of
[17:49] vulgar and dirtiness and the non-power
[17:52] of the Catholic church that's exactly
[17:54] why this nation is taking over communism
[17:57] and the Federation of churches and Jing
[17:58] itself up with the Catholic Church which
[18:00] Communism and Catholicism will unite
[18:02] together you know and here they are
[18:04] doing it why because they have rejected
[18:06] the gospel and separates them and makes
[18:07] them a different people and exactly the
[18:10] reason and ministers in the P pits
[18:12] putting up with it
[18:14] [Music]
