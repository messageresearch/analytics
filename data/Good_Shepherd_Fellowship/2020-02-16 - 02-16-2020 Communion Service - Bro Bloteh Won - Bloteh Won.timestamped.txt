[25:36] Lord
[25:41] as I chapter 5 as Iook after 5 praise
[25:54] the Lord
[25:57] this morning we were speaking on
[25:59] neighbors being yeah we wanna stayed in
[26:02] a tux or Fubini out tonight so read
[26:06] Isaiah chapter 5 verse 1 now I will sing
[26:16] to my well-beloved a son what he's doing
[26:22] present tense what he's doing in our
[26:24] mess why he redeem us for why he redeem
[26:35] us why he have took us through different
[26:38] trials why he have given us grace and an
[26:43] overcoming power in different areas of
[26:45] our life because right now god what it
[26:51] is it don't have to be a big thing it
[26:54] can be anything it's more effective than
[26:57] when a person will say so
[26:58] I want to pray to the Lord Jesus is the
[27:01] Lord Jesus
[27:05] fights against the church on earth when
[27:09] when Jesus revealed himself to pour
[27:11] water he said why are you persecuting me
[27:14] poor never met him in the flesh but what
[27:18] was persecuting the church because the
[27:21] church is the living body of Jesus
[27:23] Christ and I stand on it on the
[27:28] authority of God's Word to tell you
[27:30] tonight
[27:31] now if you don't believe what we are
[27:33] doing in this assembly just get away
[27:35] from me praise the Lord because I
[27:40] believe that God has a body of people
[27:49] that are dedicating himself to God amen
[27:53] praise the Lord
[28:04] and we will invest in that body well
[28:08] invest in what God is doing praise the
[28:11] Lord
[28:13] amen that's what the devil finds the
[28:19] church remember brother Brennan says
[28:24] he's not going to let you to be that way
[28:27] he's going to do everything and anything
[28:29] he can do
[28:30] amen you rather stare out something
[28:36] among the people I'll make a little
[28:39] gossip to go around and and and and and
[28:42] and and break the fellowship of the
[28:43] people break the joy of the people why
[28:47] because he knows the power that is in
[28:49] this living body their body on the
[28:53] throne can do nothing until it has a
[28:56] body on earth that is dedicated praise
[29:05] the Lord they have never been a time in
[29:10] Christian history word you have a bunch
[29:12] of people calling on the name of the
[29:14] Lord Jesus with with no commitment it's
[29:17] just easy to take a badge I believe the
[29:20] message and it can run from one message
[29:22] church to another message Church then
[29:25] looking for the best the best preacher
[29:27] they're looking for the best
[29:28] congregation and and no sense of
[29:31] commitment praise the Lord and the devil
[29:39] would do all those things among the
[29:41] people why because he knows the power
[29:48] that is in the living church he knows
[29:54] that when two or three come together
[30:01] when two or three come together and
[30:06] agree on anything
[30:10] praise the Lord
[30:16] he can make us to be looking in the
[30:18] future for something when the very thing
[30:23] is right under our nose praise the Lord
[30:28] it's right on our nose can you imagine
[30:34] what will happen in God can just open
[30:37] our eyes and open our understanding and
[30:41] stir our hands praise the Lord that was
[30:50] the reason why the move of God was so
[30:52] strong after the days from the date of
[30:54] Pentecost and after because the
[30:57] scripture says the people dwell together
[30:59] in one Accord Amen you know what was
[31:03] happening yeah I mean every time they
[31:05] gather together they they were expecting
[31:08] some kind of a miracle to happen it was
[31:10] expecting God to just do something
[31:12] praise the Lord
[31:17] those disciples had just they just came
[31:19] from an experience where Jesus enter
[31:22] into their meeting not coming through
[31:23] the door they were gathered together he
[31:27] just came right into their meeting show
[31:29] his hands if you have that kind of
[31:32] experience every service you expect
[31:34] Jesus to show up now when if the people
[31:37] come to church with that mindset
[31:39] expecting Jesus to show up
[31:50] praise the Lord God it's working right
[31:58] now in this body here on earth praise
[32:04] the Lord in this body right here on
[32:10] earth we must be able to see God moving
[32:19] in the lives of the young people see God
[32:25] moving in the life of husband and wife
[32:31] praise the Lord and I say all of this to
[32:37] come right back to the place that God
[32:40] has always looked at his church like a
[32:43] vane yeah amen and that's why Jesus over
[32:49] and over he speaks their parable a man
[32:51] that has a vania and then he raised up a
[32:54] man to be a stealer over the Ivania
[32:57] that's what the Prophet the prophets
[32:59] were to Israel that's what the Prophet
[33:02] was taught to the aged that's what the
[33:04] pastor is to the church or the faithful
[33:06] ministry and God on only needs the fire
[33:09] for ministry he gives all the men's
[33:11] gifts he gave all the main ability just
[33:15] every one of us finding our place and
[33:20] when we find our place you know what we
[33:22] look for we look for the little foxes
[33:25] that spoil the van
[33:27] praise the Lord amen whatever you can
[33:31] use to find a little foxes because we
[33:37] must get the foxes out of the vine if
[33:39] now they coming eat all the leaves and
[33:42] eat all the fruits with a little gossip
[33:44] year then a little suspicious next year
[33:47] then a little is in here and in what of
[33:50] you then before you get to know with
[33:52] your brother balances is just like a
[33:54] cop's that being dressed well sure it is
[33:56] nothing but they're cops
[34:02] praise the Lord but if we can use
[34:05] whatever God has placed in our hands to
[34:08] get the little foxes away praise the
[34:11] Lord
[34:12] when a little suspiciousness comma
[34:15] better Bantam says you tell the devil no
[34:17] sit on you I a liar that's my brother
[34:25] God has always looked at his church and
[34:29] his people through the ages like a fan
[34:33] yeah praise the Lord
[34:37] when we look at our home like a vein
[34:41] yeah look at the family unit praise the
[34:47] Lord we rejoice in seeing our our our
[34:53] children growing in a faith even if the
[34:55] glory through one trial or another we
[34:58] rejoice in that God believing that God
[35:00] is dealing with them wherever they are
[35:02] and whatever their situation is praise
[35:08] the Lord he says I am the vine ye are
[35:14] the branches
