Oh no I mean [Music] [Applause] yeah [Music] I have decided [Music] my love [Music] praise the Lord what a decision to make amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you tonight let's go right to the Word of God 1st Corinthians chapter 8 we just want to read the scripture yet remind ourself and go right into the convenient to 90 means first Corinthians chapter 8 praise the Lord let's read from verse one first Corinthians chapter 8 let's read from verse 1 tonight now as touching things offer unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffs up but charity edifieth and if any man think that he knoweth anything you know what nothing yet as he ought to know but if a man love God the same is known of him as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing amen and we just read their phrase together we know that we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other but one prays alone you believe there tonight for though there be that are called girls whether in heaven or on earth as there be girls many in loss meaning but to us there is one God praise the Lord now remember now one ask my finger one but one God as the one that filled it all space and time amen one God in your heart is the same in my heart praise the Lord but to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things and we in him out of the oneness and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom all things by whom things and we by him let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus we want to ask your blessings tonight upon your word and the rest of the service in Jesus name we pray amen first Corinthians chapter 10 you may have your seat let's read from verse 16 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we be meaning a one bread in one body for we are all partakers of death one breath praise the Lord amen behold Israel after the flesh and now they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the order was a adding that the idols is anything all that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything but I say they're the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they they sacrifice to devils and not to God and I who net that yes you have fellowship with Devils praise the Lord amen I want to talk a little bit about convenient tonight and word I want to go to all that I won't continue from where I stopped a little bit this morning I want to say to us tonight there we must not idolize this table Amen praise the Lord the communion is just the part of the world we are just coming to obey what the Word of God says praise the Lord let us not otherwise because thou there was the struggle the Church of Corinth was having the people were so caught up in a lot of idolatry worshiping moon stars image and and a lot of things and I would say tonight idolatry has always walked parallel with the gospel God called our father Abraham out of idolatry amen it had been to the so called better Branham says preached a message idolatry vs. Christianity and and and we will have that battle until God take us home until the rapture we will fight against idols in every way praise the Lord Amen I mean we will fight against idols there is a true revelation of God in our heart at the positive God but yet the devil he he he want to wash it will bring out things you know to distract us or to get our devotion to praise the Lord we traveled a little bit in the message of God rich in mercy land let's see what brother Branham say here tonight just for a little reading he said God is interesting in everything that's wrong everything that you anticipate in every walks of life God is interesting in you you are his child and he is rich in mercy praise the Lord now so with this thought what better Bannon was bringing alone is that God has made provision in every age in giving his people on a to me because he's interesting in our health he gave them a brazen serpent amen he interested in our deliverance he gave them a smitten Rock and because he interesting in everything that concerns us God always make a provision for his children praise the Lord but here is the thing here is that he will go ahead to let us to know that every time God will provide something for his children instead of the people worshiping the giver they they get himself attached to the gift and make an idol out of the gift praise the Lord amen he go ahead he says the people sing later by taking the same thing that God has made an atonement for them by the brazen stepping which represented seen already George and they idolized that gift and that's what I was saying God in saundra times he had endeavored manners in Diver ways and divert things God has used but people will analyze those things and miss the reality amen the communion is now all about the bread and the wine is about being obedient to the Word of God praise the Lord because if we miss that we go straight into idolatry the thing that God provided for them the brazen steppin yes this is the very god I say have no graven image but yet he told Moses to build a brazen serpent put it on the poor so if he was seeing on have no graven image and then tell Moses to build a brazen serpent and put it on the pole so which meant God was now so much interested in the brazen setting he was interested in what it represented praise the Lord he was interested in what it represented and God tonight is interested in what this bread and wine represent tonight that's what he's interested in praise the Lord maybe sometimes some of our young people you know there there there yeah yeah it has it there with the apparent citizen you know while we can drink there the bread and the wine thinking that is something special its fulfillment of the word of God are we together and that's what I want for us to see tonight we are coming in obedience to the Word of God it's just like when the Bible says if there is one sick among you lay here covenant for the other and leather or anoint him with oil is the obedience to the scripture that God moves upon is not the oil praise the Lord is not the oil people will buy or from Jerusalem oil from Jordan they will whiz it over their head is the obedience told the scripture it's not all about the oil and that's what all these people making paper maestro to Jerusalem they will come and then they bring or I brought water from the Jordan sea for your deliverance I brought rock from from from from the dead seed and and they can make money out of it because there is just something in in Amman I want to wash it the earth they want to wash it the creature more than the Creator are we together idolize the gift he says that seen a game God will now share his glory with anybody therefore we can have no two three four girls there is only one God and he will not share his glory with anything else he is God alone see so as the hidden that the hidden have many girls we have the one God and He will not share his glory with another neither will he let anything be an idol in front of him praise the Lord so when God gave the people the brazen seven in prayer so they started worshipping the seven go how to destroy even though he had made an atonement for the people and it was God's Word it was right amen he said have no graven image but he said Moses you brick built a presence happened because of what a represented Amen if you take the representation away from it it's an idol are we together even though he had he had made an atonement for the people it was God's Word it was right but when the people when they become too idolizing death then they got into trouble amen they got into trouble praise the Lord and that's what I don't want us to do the communion is though is the Word of God we are walking in line with the scripture but we must now adelies it Oh as God takes his blessing for me praise the Lord if him and him alone so Paul was dealing with these Corinthians and seeing the things that they were struggling with for this form of different form of worship and adultery that was India miss Paul first wanted to erase from their mind that there is nothing like an idol and Idol is just man's imagination that's what an idol is it's just man's imagination using your mind to create an image using your mind to create an understanding instead of believing the promised Word of God he says as concerning the things sacrificed unto a let me tell you there is nothing there is nothing like an idol because everything that a man will fashion to wash it will be something that he had me how he to get it but then when we come over to to chapter 10 and he starts talking about a communion he says we know that everything that Gentiles sacrifice is a fellowship is a worship unto devils now so what what what is right in between there is dead ah this this all devil Lucifer separate from the beginning that says that he were as ultis his throne above the stars of God and he will have the children of God worshipping Him praise the Lord and because he want to be washing so he always tried to take us away from the reality of the word and create some kind of understanding in our mind instead of believing the word and what the Word of God says we want to put our faith in electro bread and wine we must be looking at the word we must be looking at the promise that is in the word Amen what God says in his word there's nothing above the word of God if we take it out of the word we have given ourselves an idol to Washington praise the Lord so Paul bringing these people down to communion and getting them ready for the communion service he's letting them to know that the bread represent Christ amen it represent his body and we are part of their body because we are identifying ourselves with the word amen so take yourself away from it you will be misinterpreting God's Word and we must not misinterpret the world praise the Lord so he's telling them don't don't don't create something special in your mind except the word bad thing I push the table in obedience to God's Word in obedience to God's Word and to God's Word alone nothing else are we together how many times the church has taught us you know when we get we'll get into the ceremony of preparing ourself for communion amen and when it's right after the company we must leave a prepare life every day amen we must prepare ourself every day for the rapture we must prepare ourself for a closer walk with God prepared ourself with a walk alive just like enough with God every day and I've gone through all of this workout in and and and that the church world wants to give us some has left up the communion before the people and the people are so scared to death praise Lord they are just so scared to death of the lateral element when it is Christ that's supposed to be little before the people praise the Lord we must be looking at Christ we must be looking at the promised Word so Paul was trying to prepare these people don't don't create images in your mind he turned them a chapter fold go to Israel he say when I came to you on the mountain I never took no phone don't put me into a shape amen don't put me into a shape of a beast or a bird or even a man don't pull me into the ship of William Branham No praise the Lord don't even put God in a ship of this photo No you see and I took no form by the way I came to you was true the world it was true the word praise the Lord is true the word we are going down to the water to be baptized it must be in obedience to the Word of God we are coming to the convenient to take the convenient it must be in obedience to the Word of God Lord you say this in your word and in obedience to your word we partake of the bread and the wine tonight praise the Lord we makes the work with faith and we approach the world with faith and we stand on the world with faith that's trying to make something up in our mind are we together tonight amen because when we adelies that you know and you just read God reaching mercy where venom comes to the end of his message but by making emphasis on that and he even says the people idolize every provision that God made for them even talk about the utter lies the I to men that God made the atonement of divine healing the house that was the same thing they did to the brazen seven what was that that was divine healing and that is the same thing they have done to brother Branham they are idolizing him because of the gift of divine healing amen they are idolizing the gift and whenever you analyze the Cape God is not in it amen he's not in it he leaves it and when God leaves it what the people enter with idolatry but because he said God that is rich in mercy he don't for his hands and go he moved on he makes another provision he will bring something as in a mess of the people he will raise up something he will either raise up a man or he will you know give the people to give a prophetess or somebody with vision and I sue now they want to get there and start analyzing that person he moves on there was stay with that they were denominated with that and it will die with that but a living God moves on and he keeps confirming his word praise the Lord so Paul was trying to tell those people of Corinth don't idolize the convenient amen the word is a fulfillment of the word we are just coming tonight to fulfill a portion of the word just like when we go to work we fulfill a portion of the world amen when we go but our daily life we fulfilled a portion of the word we are coming to fulfill the portion of the world tonight and I want us to keep it like there praise the lord the lord bless you tonight that just by our house together just like I said idolatry has been to the call of our belief system and right from the beginning God has been pulling man out of idolatry every time he caught a prophet every time he raised a man on the scene every time he does something man we idolized I think it would get away from God you're looking at a book of kings you see you see there over and over God would give the people great victory and it would dance around the fire and it will worship God and it would bring sacrifice and pretty soon they would turn back and start worshipping the idols of the heating's praise the Lord God might use a preacher to throw a light on the Word of God and something inspiring my struck to you and God will use that thing to be with something in your life it's not the preacher is the Word of God as we come to the communion table too now we come by faith we bring different ones in our hearts we bring different needs to the Lord we bring different needs to the Lord and interception of his word - now we pray for our loved ones we pray for our children but it's not this bread or this wine will do it it's because God has said in his word my word will never go out and return back back to me may God your sessions tonight if there is any form of idolatry in us we are idolizing anything we must not even idolize our witness because God is greater than our witness like Paul says it's just it just man's imagination there is nothing like an idol for we know that there is one God and in him we move in him we have our being he's our Father in his dwelling in our hearts sometimes we can adelies fear we can just be so afraid to trust God we can be so scary to take a step of faith and hold on to the whole onto the Word of God - me oh and no my hobby or say no my I pray see there be [Music] so we yeah yes try please me from earth racing three [Music] Oh Lee goes revival comes from be read by both comes

brake it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament of my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me for us often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he comes in John chapter 13 praise the Lord first two and suffer being ended the devil having them put in the heart of Judas Iscariot son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father have given all things into his hands and that he was come from God he went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his gaming and took a towel and didn't himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wet them with the towel wherewith he was given then cometh he to Simon and Peter said unto Him Lord does they I wash my feet jesus answered and said unto them what I do that I knoweth not now but thou shalt know yea after Peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if I wash the net they had no part with me Simon Peter said unto Him Lord not my feet on it but also my hands and my head Jesus to him he that is wash needed nassif to wash his feet but is clean every way and yeh I claimed but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said he and that were clean so after he had washed their feet and have taken his garment and set down the game he said unto them know ye what I have done unto you you called me master and Lord and ye see well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord
