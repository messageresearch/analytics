take our Bibles and uh we go to uh T John as we come in uh to closing this that we have taken as a series since the beginning of the year I want us to read T John reading from verse one praise the Lord the he unto the well beloved G whom I love in the truth belove I wish above all things that thou May prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper for I Rejoice greatly when the Brethren came and testify of the truth that is in the even as thou walth in the truth I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children Walk In Truth beloved that thus Faithfully whatsoever there does to the Brethren and to strangers praise the Lord so this brother had a testimony of uh of being well to the Brethren and also to strangers which have borne witness of that charity before the church whom uh if thou uh bring forward on their Journey after a Godly sck thou sh do well because there for his name's sake they went forth thinking nothing of the Gentiles so there's there is H there's a testimony here and uh and and that's what we we we we want to talk about a little bit and uh uh this this individual uh that John referred to here uh has has being referred to in in several places in U in the in the New Testament but let's let's go down a little bit here uh I will read verse five again belove thatou does Faithfully whatsoever that does to the Brethren and to strangers which have bought witness of thy charity before the church whom whom if thou bring forward on their Journey after a Godly s thou shall do well now so there there's a little thing that is that is kept right in here this is almost like what we would term in our day of uh supporting missionaries supporting people that are on the field or ministers that are coming in our gates that's that's that's what uh John is referring to here because you will soon see why he's saying that because that for his name's sake they went These Guys these brothers that are going out they went out for Christ's name sake taking nothing of the Gentiles we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellow helpers of the truth if you can go you can also send one amen you can send one by your prayers you can send one by your support praise the Lord I wrote onto the church but there trets who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us net where if I come I will remember his deeds which he does pring against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither does he himself receive the Brethren and forbade them that hold and casteth them out of the church so there's a character here and we want to look at that character tonight beloved follow that that which is evil but that which is good he that does good is of God but he that does evil have not seen God praise the Lord Demitri has good report of all men and of the truth itself yeah and we also bear record and ye know that our record is truth let's pray together father we want to just thank you Lord God for giving us another Wednesday night Lord Jesus is the MayDay of the week and father we just come in tonight to say thank you thank you Father God for bringing us from the beginning of the week and Lord we know you will take us to the end of the week we want to ask your blessings now father on your word tonight thank you for being with your children Lord girl Watching Over Us Lord the little ones going to school brothers and sisters going to work Lord businesses so father and and different things so Lord God but yet you have kept us Lord while we were away one from another and you have brought us together Lord we know that God you have spread forth your wings the son of righteousness that have raised him with healing in his wings and we love you T tonight father Lord every time oh God in the scripture that Lord father uh their character Lord uh of of a female h a bird Lord girl was shown is it always show Lord your motherly love to us you told Israel how I will have H you like a hand will take her young one on her wings and father we love you tonight because you are the one that have gathered us Lord for the Gathering of the of your people is unto you and to you alone we love you bless the rest of the service now in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen amen amen uh God bless you good to be in the house of the Lord amen good to see you Uncle Uncle Joe amen and uh uh sister Naomi gave me one of your book I've been enjoying it that's that's a good work that's a good work praise the Lord tonight I just like I said we're trying to close uh it's easy to start a series difficult to close it amen you get down one of these Rabbit Trail you keep going you keep turning Corner missing your way you come back again and it's it just like there praise the Lord some of the easier way to stop a series is to just travel and then when you come back you start something different amen praise the Lord but tonight as uh as we have been looking on this we had the privilege to pretty much go through the the the three uh records of John first second and third John and uh uh tonight I want to look at a character here that uh John is reporting here say he's talking uh uh of of of a brother here he talking of one of uh uh uh um one of the Saints there and and if you look in the in the New Testament there there are few different places that uh this uh this Brother G was uh mentioned Acts Chapter 19 Verse uh 29 the scripture mention him there also uh the whole city was filled with confusion and having cult GES and and all of those men you go to Acts Chapter 20 The Bible mention him also now that was that was a common name uh uh when you look through uh some of the commentaries there that was a common name so whether this is just one person or or the or you know is someone that was bearing the same name and but there is something that is that is that is remarkable and that's what we want to look at not the man himself but the character of Christ that he was bearing praise the Lord that's what matters amen and he's speaking here uh which of course we took on Sunday uh talking about the son of righteousness Rising with healing in his wings beloved I which above all things that thou May prosper and be in health even as th soul Prosper it now uh uh John here coming from uh the island of pmos where we talk uh taking the series from and uh he's seeing how the church on a vision has prospered with Christ in his midst amen Christ in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and John uh on the vision he's beginning to understand some of the things that he live out in the ministry of Jesus Christ some of the things that Jesus said to them why he was with them that they never understood John beginning to understand it after the Holy Ghost has come and here he is on the island of pmos seeing these different things you know on the vision and then he comes back to the church and giving the report things that were a bit difficult to express so he's telling the church here as he talks to this brother Above All Things how God desired to have a healthy Church praise the Lord amen because when God first manifested his children in Eden their beginning was healthy like we said on on Sunday Adam was one of the most healthy of men the scripture never gave us uh how long he Liv even before Genesis chapter 3 praise the Lord amen whether the years recorded in the Bible is after Genesis chapter 3 or from the very day that God created him but what is important here is that he was in good health praise the Lord and even when you look at the the the the the the realm of Health that Adam was in you cannot compare it because there was no sickness so we we look at Health in a way that we think about health now because we have all of the names of all of these sickness and different experiences in our body so we we can we we know what health is we know when when a person says why I'm not feeling well well I'm I mean I'm doing good it's it's it's in comparison to something but before Genesis chapter 3 Adam never had no comparison praise the Lord am he was in he was in a state of fullness in so much that you know his thought was in according to God he speak and that's exactly what God was thinking to name this thing and and everything he had a holy Veil on him I mean so much in health that his mind was not corrupted his mind was not polluted he never knew fear in in all of that praise the Lord amen and uh and and and even now no matter how much by God's grace we will prosper in health we will still have some form of illness in our body because our body is not redeemed praise the lord we get sick we be treated by the doctors or we be prayed for or whichever way the healing will comes to us it comes by God but we will get sick again praise the Lord and until we leave from here Lazarus after uh being dead 3 days went into corruption he resurrected but yet he had to die again praise the Lord he had to die again because he was in a corrupt body glory be to God but just like uh uh John said here the desire here is that uh our body will will will prosper in health you know will go from from from from Health uh stages of from glory to glory from Better Health and uh even as our soul prosperous so you see the thing the thing about it uh about being healthy in this light is uh as uh you know uh uh coming to a place of understanding praise the Lord coming to a place of understanding just like when we look at Malachi 4 on Sunday we saw that uh there in Malachi 4 under that promise you know uh uh the prophet said uh we we we we listed uh there were there were four things that we listed that uh uh Malachi spoke about praise the Lord let me let me see if I can drop back uh uh to my notes and there I help me praise the Lord the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings he will go forth which of course we say healing healing in his wings speaks of health and protection he will go forth it speaks of Deliverance and freedom he will grow up as a calf in the stall it speaks of safety and we will be careful and then also we will be wellfed and we will also tread down the wicked it speaks of overcoming power so we we see there these four things also just like in Isaiah 53 the Bible talk about how he was bruised and uh uh he was chastin for our peace and uh uh um he was bruised for our uh uh our iniquity he was chasten for our Peace by his tribes we are healed and there's another one for our iniquity I mean our iniquity our transgression Bru for our transgression and another one for our iniquity so we see also there honor their Pro is there is four now I was also thinking in a place of healing we realized that brother brandham talks about uh uh or the scripture tells us about the four beasts around the throne praise the Lord and uh uh which of course the there are four anointing that comes uh uh right from Eden all the way down we know it was the same chuban that was guarding the tree of life and then over in Revelation they were around the throne praise the Lord and uh and and just like we have these four promises in Malachi we have those four over there in Isaiah 53 yeah we have these four living creatures we have these four anointing we have these four powers that goes from the Throne of God praise the Lord one is represented by the lion are we together the other one is represented by uh uh the ox amen and we also have another one that is represented by the man and one is also represented by the ego now so just like you are seeing these four promises or four element Under This Promise of the son of righteousness if you bring there to the anointing that comes from the throne now take it this way every healing comes from God every form of healing are we together amen so every form of healing that we will ever experience will be projected to us or ministered To Us by one of these anointing every form of healing are we together praise the Lord amen now so we if if if we want to take uh uh uh you know uh healing under the anointing of the lion praise the Lord amen we want to take healing honor the anointing of the lion you'll realize and and and and we know that is that's the word of God every every form of healing comes from God praise the Lord you will realize that uh uh there is there is an anointing that comes from the Throne of God that that you know there's uh there's that that that fight against sicknesses I mean just like it was in Isaiah uh uh 14 uh uh you know uh running down a road here that's not part of my notes but it's okay I think I'm in a safe place praise the Lord now so you will see that under the on the Lion's anointing just like how it was with uh with with under the church ages the Lion's anointing was the anointing that was that that uh that brought forth the word on the first three Edge and on those age there were great uh uh uh uh missionaries you know uh uh Paul and all of those Apostles they were crossing the great sea and trying to carry the gospel to India they were all operating Under The Lion anointing are we together praise the Lord and under the ox anointing like it is uh uh applied to the church that is the anointing under the anointing that God gave uh the the the Believers in the dark ages for them to be able to give their B willingly okay praise the Lord for the C of the Gospel praise the Lord the Lord anointed them so much their their fear a sense of fear were taken uh H uh from them that uh you know they they were they were willing to do their wedding and be burned to the Stak I mean I mean children would rather go with their parents to the Stak and and and and uh you know they were honor the anointing and and on uh uh uh in the fourth Church age brother Brandon says the church can do nothing will respond to the anointing of her age that's right praise the Lord amen hallelujah in as much as we love the Lord and in as much as God has given us great Revelation and great mystery our anointing is not an ox anointing that's right so no matter how much Revelation you have you will still have a sense of Fear To Die For The Gospel because that's not your anointing it does not make you a weaker believer it's just that you are not anointed for death your anointing is an ego rapturing anointing so the first thing you think is either you get in a carard or find a plain ticket and get out of there that's your anointing you are responding to your anointing praise the Lord amen and we know under the man's anointing that God was able to bless great men under the Reformation praise the Lord that were able to to take the gospel out and uh and great men great men were blessed under the anointing they had great Insight in in the word praise the Lord they had great Insight in the word even though it was not their age for the mystery to be open but they gave time to steud because they were anointed for that time it was the time that man was blessed to start the printing press because God wanted his word to come in a Bible form praise the Lord you know so God was using men just giving men breakthrough you know they were having they were having knowledge and all of that and then the the the last anointing there is the eagle the rapturing anointing amen where the quickening power has returned back to our hearts amen the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead will Quicken your mortal body amen that's the eag that anting but when we bring it down in the sense of uh of uh of uh uh this promise that God want us to prosper in health even as our soul prospering because you will realize down through the church ages many struggled during that time because you know with all the promises in the word many Believers thought that if you believe in Jesus Christ you know you you are a believer in the word you know sickness should be far from you so many people struggle in their faith when they get sick right and they prayed and they prayed and they not feeling well they go back and start to look for things in their life have I failed the Lord and uh and and some would say is you know it's it's family curse and and and maybe my father did something but you know Jesus there with that blind man he said it was NE of the father it was need of the mother God allowed that that he must be glorified praise the Lord so uh before the opening of the word for us to come to this place to be able to understand that every healing proceed from the Throne of God every healing that we ever that that any mortal we ever experience we come on the wings of one of these anointing praise the Lord amen God will either bless uh uh uh a person to go through uh uh uh uh their healing process you will see that uh honor the man's anointing God has has blessed this age of science with with great Medical doctors I mean Medical Science have gone to the level that the word has never seen praise the lord it's God's love for us wanting to keep us in good health I mean sicknesses uh that that that that will kill people you know well that was that was uh Dame terminal disease and now something very common for medical science praise the Lord even though it's it's Medical Science but because healing comes from God like brother brandham said he says uh you know the doctor can put the bones together but God has to do the healing amen they can get in there and do the surgery but God has to do the healing he has to bring life back to the tissues glory be to God am that's what the prophet of God says I spend time praying for doctors he said because they are God gift to the word are we together praise the Lord they are God gift to the word now you will see also that honor the O anointing which which of course is is is is very wonderful just like uh The People Under The Dark Age they they were anointed to be able to to suffer for the name of Christ to be able to go you know into the lion Den or be burned at the stake God put that anointing on them so there is a power that that that is released from the Throne of God that a Believer or a a a child of God can can can be going through illnesses and different things in their body but they are still believing God for their healing praise the Lord amen amen they are anointed with an O anointing that comes from the Throne of God they will pray they will get in the prayer line they will be Anointed with oil but God will carry them from Grace to Grace praise the Lord amen and honor thy AR anointing that sin might never receive full healing in their body now you'll realize that uh Eddie White praise the Lord amen had wise sister there in in in in in in the brandom Tabernacle brother Bram talks about how th girl how many times she's she's been brought to the prayer line she's been praying for and he waited for vision he waited that God will speak to him about their child and even at a time where he would speak salvation to her while children he thought that she will have asked for her sister's healing praise the Lord she was right there right there in the Tabernacle and brother will was raised from dead she were right there in the Tabernacle and and and there were hundreds of prayer lines that were going on do you think that God never saw her oh sure God saw her but I believe that God had her under the AR anointing okay praise the Lord honor that ano anointing that is the thing that makes a uh uh uh a sin a Believer can go through I mean different struggle in their health but yet their their their faith is so strong they are believing that God is going to come through the next morning and heal their body sometime they are so anointed they feel like they will rise up but they are not going anywhere why because God have them onor an anointing he's keeping them there for a testimony praise the Lord and you might look at that person and then you Fe oh man this this brother oh this sister is so sick oh God be merciful to them and then when God look at them he said that's my child praise the Lord they are serving my purpose praise the Lord now he tells us the difference between healing and Miracle which of course we fall under the lion anointing and the Eagles anointing okay one is Instinct the sickness just fly away praise the Lord it just fly away whether your faith whether the preacher of Faith whether the faith that is in the room it please the Lord that that just fly away you can't find a trace the doctor will not be able to find the trace amen amen praise the Lord amen and the other form of healing God is going to give you a revelation that you will get healed right but now he wants you like brother brandham said he will give you a vision of you seeing yourself healed and give you Grace and Faith to walk towards that healing body you are walking every day believing that I'm going to be healed I'm going to be healed it's a process until you come to full health amen all of those form of healings are healing amen they all comes from the Throne of God praise the Lord are we together praise the Lord I know how I got here that's not where I was going tonight somebody is is the reason for this amen I promise you I'm not the reason I am not the reason somebody might have dropped me in this channel okay praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen is something that is seen in uh in church history even even in little time you find many of the the people that came on the Pentecostal Revival that experienced the move of God they got so much against hospital they never wanted to take pills they never wanted to see the doctor because they were expecting that God will heal them why because they were in they saw the move of God praise the Lord until certain Church uh certain h h h h Church movement they preach to their members not to go to hospital because we we we serve a God that that raised Lazarus from the dead what is your sickness to God but you see the opening of the seals amen the opening of the seals have exposed us to the fullness of God praise the Lord and to know that every healing comes from the Throne of God but it come onor one of these four anointing praise the Lord amen amen person dealing with something in their life and believing God for their illness and if they might die by their sickness it has nothing to do with their soul praise the Lord that sickness was just a buggy to get that person in the presence of God praise the Lord it does not means you have a stronger Faith than that person praise the Lord may God help us tonight can I can you please uh leave me let me preach what I want to preach tonight whoever is responsible for this praise the Lord let me be able to preach what I want to preach tonight okay let's uh maybe this will help me amen maybe this will help me if we if we just read uh this quote Jesus rose maybe it will help to change my my channel of T here now let's read this and if people can ever get place and and their Faith Center now follow me with this now this bless me now I'm sure you bless you too if people can ever get placed in their Faith Center not upon present situation but upon what God has said about the situation praise the Lord let's let's think about that if we can ever get to the place where our faith is centered not on the present situation the present situation is there it's all around us we can see it but what what is the word of God saying about the situation are we together amen get our faith centered not upon present situation but upon what God has said about it if you can remember that no no matter what comes or go goes or how impossible that it seems to be yet God word will take its place every time amen praise the Lord amen God said let there be it did not bother him how long it talk but whatever he said came to pass I we together praise the Lord as as hmmer the situation is always there we wake up with Fai we go to bed with Fai is is is before us but we have a promise now it's how to take our eyes from the situation and set our eyes on the promise am praise the Lord amen that is the work of Faith to get our eyes from the situation like like he said you cannot plant a seed and then every morning you go and Dick it up and says is this seed getiing I I've not seen any growth yet you can't keep it out you you have to put it under the Earth and leave it there let it go through its process so that's the work of Faith that's what that channel of Faith is doing in our life is taking our eyes from the situation and putting our eyes on the promise concerning that situation praise the Lord you can take one promise for every situation or you can take one promise for each situation praise the Lord hallelujah that's what faith is doing in the Believers taking our eyes from the situation and putting our eyes on the promise concerning that situation if you can remember that no matter what comes or goes or how impossible that it seems to be yet God word concerning that will take place every time amen see in the face of every difficulties nothing nothing can take its place nothing can take the place of what God has said right concerning their situation there is nothing you can do to make it happen quickly quickly all there is nothing you can do to make it delay praise the Lord God never set his time piece of bringing his word on your action praise the Lord no he never said his time piece of bringing his word to pass on our actions so we might go to 21 days of fasting I would just ask use that 21 days to thank God that his word is truth and tell him I believe you're going to bring it to pass praise the Lord are we together yeah I was I was uh I was I was sharing the uh uh a little story kind of a testimony and I heard about anther that was trying to to Mark uh uh you know uh uh a Praying Woman was praying and asking God to provide her knes and he was he was a neighbor and then uh you know he he's always bothered about the prayer and he always to Mark and and uh so he went and and shopping and you know and and pick out some of the things he heard her mentioning and then uh and brought it and tried and drop it over on her porch you know and she came out and she raised her hand and started praising God then he came from behind the house and he says uh uh what's what's going on you know she said uh wow you know I'm trusting the Lord I asked the Lord and the Lord provided and he says well I think I'm your God because I bought these things praise the Lord because I hear you praying she said well you know when I was praying I forgot to mention and tell God who to bring it and he choose you praise the Lord oh praise praise the Lord the scripture say in that hour he will give us the right thing to say see in the face of every difficulty nothing nothing can take its place it has the preeminence the word has the preeminence because is none other than God himself in a spoken word is God himself praise the Lord is God himself in a printed form praise the lord it's God himself a a spoken word nothing can be above it are we together nothing can be above it he has the pre preeminence because is none other than God himself in the spoken word and it has to come to pass all my days I have I have tried solemnly to keep the people on the word of God praise the Lord the the the healing testimonies is just to build our faith we testify that God have done this go because he is the same yet yesterday today and forever praise the Lord but if there is one place we want to rest our faith and is the only solid place that faith can rest on is on the word of God praise the Lord I was looking at something out of the message half his time you know I was talking about uh uh the scheme of the devil he was talking about uh uh Jesus in his trials you know the the what on on the Mountain at the beginning of his uh of his ministry and uh you know and he he was he was just trying to to show there and and says uh you know uh the devil can hand you he can give you a handful of Supernatural if a man just want to rest you know his faith on Supernatural things he says Satan can hand you a handful of Faith praise the Lord if you want to rest your faith on speaking in tongues or prophesy it or some kind of a manifestation the devil can produce that praise the Lord but we must try to keep the people on the word for that was his promise to me he told me that he will bless me what uh wherever I went and a who prospered and the work of the Lord should grow but that that the word that I must be sure that the word was first in everything praise the Lord the word must be first in everything and that's and that is our inspiration on this beginning Series in the beginning was the word amen in the beginning was the word so when John came back from the island of pmos with the things that he saw you go through all his his book there you will realize that he kept printing the church back to the beginning amen first John 2 John uh he that was in the beginning he that we have touched uh H H and and and he kept printing the church back to that because that is the beginning of everything the word is the beginning brother Braham says if you want to start a church start it on the word amen you want to start a family start your family on the word you want to do a business start it right on the word praise the Lord because the word is that solid foundation are we together we'll take another one yeah yeah he says and no matter in any kind of service the word should have preeminence it should be first and the healing of the soul is always first why because the healing of the Soul comes by the word are we together why a man when a man is Born Again of the spirit of God he has Immortal in eternal life and shall never perish but when a man is healed of his body it is just for uh a limited time but Salvation of the soul is forever he becomes a new creature in Christ when he's healed of his soul praise the Lord now if you if you can just look in a few codes that I've read you will see what I'm going tonight and where actually I want to go tonight is as John spoke to the church there the brothers there he identified a character he talks about this man like Jude would say certain man has creep in unaware he talks about this man that is called deot tropus and one thing that John said about him is that he love the preeminence among the brethren and while we try to show you in the word there is one thing that must have the preeminence Among Us that's the word praise the Lord the pastor don't have the preeminence nobody have the preeminence brother brandham don't have the preeminence no is the word that have the preeminence amen praise the Lord now you think about it in the early church that John will be able after after after such an experience when he could see from Revelation chapter 1 to the closing of the vision it was all about Jesus Christ and then to return back to the church and see a man as s such a place among the Brethren that he has to approve for a man to come in or he shut him up he destroyed him he he took such a place among the Believers praise the lord it's easy to identify praise the lord it's easy to identify because when we spoke about our H H sin sinner in the beginning in one of our beginning series we we look at this the the F of Lucifer I took I took that and add to our notes tonight and when we read in Isaiah chapter uh uh 14 we saw that he says I will extend in into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit in the Mount of the try it was just an eye and an ey and an eye and an eye praise the Lord I will exalt myself above the stars of God what what brought him down what cast him out is because he was taking the preeminence wow he was taking the preeminence the desire to have the preeminence above the stars of God and here it said John is identifying the same character in the church this is still the Ephesian church this is still the beginning of the church and if we have it at the beginning we will have it until we go in Rapture there will always be men there will always be men that we want to have the preeminence praise the Lord you see that is the beautiful thing about the word of God is that no man's understanding of the word is the interpretation of the word the interpretation of the word only it comes to a prophet that's right he's the one that God give that's what that's the word the ministry of a prophet is praise the Lord your understanding is just an inspiration my understanding is just an inspiration but when a man try to exer his understanding that until you see it the way that I see it my you are wrong then we have a spirit here yes sir of a man that is trying to take their preeminence among the Brethren yes praise the lord we talking about a health at church we're talking about going going back to full health praise the Lorden Adam and Eve enjoy full health when when they were under the son of righteousness as long as they stay under the word amen as long as the word was having the preeminence in their home the word was having preeminence in Eden they enjoy full health when they left the word sickness comes in Praise the Lord that's the reason why in the local church no one is above the word right praise the Lord amen amen Even in our homes the husband is ahead but he's not above the word that's right praise the Lord if a woman love her husband and he step out of the word you're having a god-given responsibility to tell him look the scripture did not say that that's right it's only the word that has the preeminence are we together now John identifying this thing in the church above all I desire that you prospered in health even as your soul prospered we heard about your testimony and how you are you you been a blessing to The Strangers that have come among you you've been a blessing to the fellow laborers that have traveled your way but we also heard there is one that is having the preeminence on the Brethren praise the Lord it was either his way or the highway glory be to God and that's exactly the way of King and so much that God will come down and say King if you will do what your brother ail it yes sir even though you did not have a revelation I'm I'm I'm I'm giving you the che sheet yes sir he got a revelation you just do what he did no it was either his way or the highway are we together Christ is the Myster of God revealed in Christ is the Myster of God revealed that's word we learn and and and he he taught us of uh the three four purpose of this whole Plan of Redemption the one goal that God had of stepping out of internity expressing himself the one goal that was in his mind but yet he made known that one go in a threefold manifestation praise the Lord let's read a little on that find a place to close it tonight notice God had a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret God in his great mystery secret that he had before the word began he's got a threefold purpose in it the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to his people amen God want to be new no praise the Lord yes sir Hallelujah you see there is one thing about adolat adolat is where when an image is there that image is set up is giv a setting name and and and you are only told the things that you're not supposed to do before he gets angry with you praise the Lord amen amen you're not supposed to do this I mean the things that you need to do to appease more than a peing God he desire to be known praise the Lord more than just the dos and the done God's desire is to make himself known praise the Lord amen I think that is the attribute that is in every parent where the the love to tell their children about uh their parents and where they came from and and uh you know and and uh you know and and and just and just and and just everything about them praise the Lord and I believe that's a desire of the heavenly father that we must know him to know him is life praise the Lord not to know his word and know the right quotation to know him he want to be known praise the Lord because in knowing him we get to know ourself we get to know where we came from Our Truth identity the first thing God the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to his people he couldn't do that as a great Jehovah God who cover all space Time and Eternity he couldn't do that he's too great to ever be revealed to people because it will be too mysterious praise the Lord amen now I see I see maybe maybe maybe I see where that that first that first place I was trapped talking about a f anointing maybe it was from his book maybe because I mentioned that you know committing the book that he wrote and uh sister Nami Shar that book with me maybe that's what trapped me in there I was just reading that it just came to my mind maybe maybe I'm just saying maybe but thank God I'm out of there amen he's too great to ever be revealed to people because it will be too mysterious and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man that God who condem himself yes sir praise the Lord just to be known just so we can know him praise the Lord that he's not just this angry being that is up there the Bible says he's touched by the feelings of our infes he will condescend just so we will know him praise the Lord the only way that he will uh he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it he wanted to express himself that was the first F the first uh uh uh uh part of the three four purpose God wanted to be known the second the second to have the preeminence in his body of Believers praise the Lord that is his bride that he might live in people now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now there had to there had to be some way to get it back again praise the Lord hallelujah now see see this if if the Lord can help us to bring it out uh for us to be able to see it tonight this great God that wanted to be made known he humbled himself the Bible say even to the death of the Cross he condemns himself he made himself so simple and then when he's known among his people that gave them a Grace of Revelation to put this one that has made himself so simple to put him back to his first place that's right amen amen praise the Lord amen amen amen not everyone has the ability to do that that's right it's a grace of God Amen praise the Lord yes sir take take it in our natural our natural h h h relationship you know uh uh uh parents go to I mean sorry children go to school and and sometimes they you know they get they get uh H H better education than their parents praise the Lord they get more degree than their parents and and then pretty soon the the you know were uh they just that old man he just he just like his you know his old ideas praise the Lord but to realize and find the grace that no matter how well we have been educated that Daddy is still your daddy and you owe him all that respect that's right praise the Lord is the struggle in marriage relationship amen we submit one to another but yet God give us roles in the family praise the Lord the grace the victory for the wife is no matter how much God has blessed her no matter how much God has blessed both of you but just to always find that Grace to put your husband in the place that he's supposed to be and not make your wife a d m but put her to the place that she's supposed to be praise the Lord and that's the reason why brother Bram said it's only the bride that can give Christ the preeminence that's righten why because she she has been given the grace to submit herself to the Worden when the word says a woman should not preach she said okay I will take my place praise the Lord are we together only the bride that's that's the ability you see because he have humbled himself amen making himself known to us amen praise the Lord until all sorts of stories are written about him and people call him all sorts of name this is the very God of creation he's the one that hold our heartbeat praise the Lord that no matter what we go through we must always give him the first place praise the lord we must always give him the first place and I will tell you it is that Grace of acknowledging him every time we see a new day praise the Lord the job can wait the schedule can wait the one that wakes you up in the morning acknowledge his presence only the bride will do that praise the Lord because many will will acknowledge Him many many all they will be humble I mean they will they will be they will be punctual to church they will become a faithful believer as soon as God bless them they become so blessed that they don't have time for God getting involved in other missions and all different things but the bride praise the Lord amen that's one of his purpose of having a people that we give him the first place the word had the preeminence in eating when Adam was under that word he was prospering in health his soul was prospering his mind was Pros the word had the preeminence praise the Lord giving Christ the preeminence is not being a message believer no praise the lord it's not ignoring the courts all knowing the three four purpose that's that's not that's not giving Christ the preeminence praise the Lord he wants to be the first not among many praise the Lord he want to be the first and the only yes in the life of his bride now that we have many and we make him the first no he want to be the first and the only are we together praise the Lord now you think about it now think about it that place that God has reserved for himself the very purpose of why he condescended that he will be able to get a people that will bring him to that place and here is a man trying to claim that in the life of the people that it is me praise the Lord do you see how it is so easy to get to that place you know what Paul said Paul said because of the the Revelation that has been given to me he said if God did not give me an reflection okay it could be easy for me to exalt myself among the rest of the disciples so God dropped an infirmity in his life and taught him my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in your weakness he made us I'm telling you he made oh yes sir he knows me so he he got to keep me he got to keep me to keep me yes praise the Lord and he knows how to keep you amen he know how to keep you from yourself because if he let you to yourself we will not know you are we together yes and no no man must take their place in our lives I mean he can be the one that led us to Christ he can be the one that baptized us he can be the one that marry us he might be the one that bury us but he might never take that place in our lives praise the Lord as much as we love our our pastor you must never have the preeminence above the word yes praise the Lord as long as you as much as you love your favorite preacher whoever he is that place of preeminence praise the Lord amen and that's the reason why he want us to know him because no matter how much Grace has been given me to be able to share the word with you God want to bring you to a place where you can be able to see him for Yourself Praise the Lord you see that's that's the thing that brother BR would talk about the church got to the place where they say our pastor say why they have made their Pastor say an interpretation of the word praise the Lord glory be to God are we together am if we will prosper in health as our soul should Prosper let Christ have the preeminence amen praise the Lord amen let Christ have the preeminence glory be to God and then the tear for purpose the tear to restore the kingdom to its right place to it to its rightly position that fell by sining by the first Adam back to word he he walk in the cood of the evening with his people talk to them fellowship with them praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight that's where we wanted to bring you to come to the place of being a healthy Son of God he want you to walk with him in the Cod of the day praise the Lord just like I said I say it all the time quote of the day is beautiful I read quote of the day all of my Bible
