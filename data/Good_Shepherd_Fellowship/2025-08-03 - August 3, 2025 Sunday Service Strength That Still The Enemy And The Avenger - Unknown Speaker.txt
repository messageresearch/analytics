Let's just read a portion of God's word. Let's read Psalm chapter 8. Psalm chapter 8. Just to be able to get a little feeling of you this morning, we will do a responsive reading like we normally do. I read verse one and then uh you read verse two. We read the last verse together. Psalm chapter 8. Praise the Lord. Psalm chapter 8. Oh Lord our God, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who hath set thy glory above the heavens. When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained, [Music] &gt;&gt; for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and honor. All sheep and oxen yet all the beasts of the field. &gt;&gt; Let's read the last verse together. Oh Lord our God, how excellent is thy name in all the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hebrews chapter 11. Let's read the fifth chapter of the Bible. Hebrews chapter 11. Oh, praise the Lord. Hebrews chapter 11. Let's read from verse 32. And then I will have you to take the comfort of your seat while I remain standing. And you are free to stand up if you feel the joy of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want to rejoice in the word, you are free to stand up. You are free to join me standing. Hebrews chapter 11, reading from verse 32. And what shall we and what shall I most say? For the time will fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson, Jeffi, David also Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdue kingdoms rough righteousness or obtain promises stopped the mouth of lions. Quench the violence of the fire, escape the edge of the swore. out of weakness were made strong. Wax violently in fight turned to fight the army of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again and order were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and other had trial of cruel mocking and sculing year more over of bound and imprisonment. They were stoned. They were saw as thunder. That's Isaiah and were tempted uh and were slain with the swirl. They they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins uh being destitute, afflicted and tormented. Of whom this word Amen. &gt;&gt; of whom the word was not worthy. They wander in the desert, in mountains, and in dense caves of the earth. And these all having obtained a good report through faith, receive not the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; God having provided some better things. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In verse 35, he speaks of a better resurrection. And yet in verse 40 uh uh he's speaking of better things having provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Amen. And this morning I was uh thinking to Good to see you, Kevin. I didn't see you back there. And uh I was thinking to uh continue with uh our subject we were speaking about uh uh last Sunday and uh uh I was looking at uh uh the three walls this morning. and and some beautiful things I thought that we we wanted to share with you this morning. And as I was as I was studying, I just the the information just keep piling up. And I thought, man, it's going to be a long service this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I hope uh I hope the people had a good rest and a good breakfast, but I don't want to have a long service this morning because we have a prayer meeting this evening. So I thought I said well Lord uh I don't want to ruin the subject also. So I want to take my time. So I thought I would keep it and then when we return back we will start from there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I I thought also to be able to share with you this morning uh something that really blessed me during the week. It was it was it was a meditation. It was something that I was looking at uh I was listening to a testimony of a father uh uh that the older son call him that his younger son has just passed away. And uh and and he said they were he was terrified with the news and he and the wife decided to pray and and decided to go and uh over to where the boy was. They had to drive hours of, you know, the boys were in another setting and they were in another setting. And then while they were driving, you know, he kept he kept trying to fight the the thought of fear and uh he would just they would just they would talk encourage one another and for a while the car would just be silent you know and you know and they were driving and uh you know they have removed the board already to the mall and uh you know and and he and his wife they were just agreeing in faith and just agreeing in faith you So uh as uh as they were driving there, but when they got over to uh to uh uh the mortuary, what happened is they had a uh uh the young man just sat up on his bed. &gt;&gt; He just sat up on his bed. So he got there, he and his wife, you know, uh uh and uh um they decided to go in to go and see uh their son, you know, and then when they open the door, even the the undertaker and everybody was there was was very shocked because they met the young man sitting up on his bed. And uh and as I was just I was just thinking about that you know and and uh uh and then he he quoted Psalm chapter 8. So I went to Psalm chapter 8 and you know I started reading and I read the whole my inspiration will be coming from this morning. If you read Psalm chapter 8 again, how oh Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth who has set thy glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of babes and suckling. Now uh this is a very familiar uh scripture and you see uh uh sometimes we have sometimes we have the tendency as humans to be able to picture God's word the way our human brain conceive it. Amen. You read out of the mouth of babes and suckling. What comes to your mind is is little children, okay? Those that are just, you know, crying and, you know, and sometimes they would just say thing, God bless you, out of the mouth of babes and and suckling, you know, and and little kids and and all of that. But if you really look at the the the the context of the scripture and you see what David is trying to express here, you will realize that David, think about this now. David was still a youth when he faced Goliath. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And you might not think of a youth being a babe or a suckling. But I want to say to you this morning, we are all babes and suckling. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because uh our father Abraham, the father of faith at at old age, God still breasted him with strength. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When he leaned on El Shad. So we are all babes and suckling. So that's that's what I want for us to look at where we want to address there. Like David said here, out of the mouth of babes and suckling have thou ordained strength because of thine enemy that thou admire still the enemy and their adventure. So this morning I want to speak on a little subject just to encourage you. Strength that still the enemy and the adventure. Strength that still the enemy and the adventure. That's what I want to speak on this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh we thank the Lord that he has ordained strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like Zachchariah said is uh uh uh is is is not by power, it's not by might &gt;&gt; talking about not our physical power, not our physical might. Amen. &gt;&gt; But by the spirit, say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it, you know, it's it's it's beautiful to be able to to uh to to to rely on God this way to know that even before we got here, &gt;&gt; there are things that he have ordained for our benefit. &gt;&gt; And that's what one I want to talk about this morning. The Bible say he ordained strength. &gt;&gt; So our strength was ordained. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were ordained to stand in this hour. &gt;&gt; We are ordained to face the challenge of the day. &gt;&gt; We are ordained to rise above our weaknesses, our failures, whatever it is. &gt;&gt; He has ordained us. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Strength that still the enemy &gt;&gt; and the adventure. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we just want to thank the Lord this morning. But before I go into that, I just I want to share something with you and uh uh uh I want to share something with you and and my basis of sharing this is to is to just say and appreciate how God is uh has been helping our our little assembly. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord has been very very good to us. He has been very good to us and uh uh what an awesome God. &gt;&gt; You know, he's been providing everything that we need. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's been bringing wonderful, wonderful preachers our way. Wednesday service was just a masterpiece. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Gideon. Oh my God. Praise the Lord. He did a good job. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The gospel I calling to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The gospel I calling to the bride. He did a beautiful job and we thank the Lord for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just like I said the last time, you know, I think uh uh the Lord has been mindful of us. He's been giving most of our visitors this year been coming on Wednesday night and then Sunday somebody else will call and ask for them and then we will give them freely. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Someone called me one time and and they were they were accusing me of a certain brother coming to the country and I'm just keeping him here. I said, "Well, he just come here the weekend. He don't come and stay a month here with me. He just only come on a weekend and uh uh and then before he even come his meetings are all planned. So uh another time we will make uh uh arrangement you know for him to be with you." So that has been wonderful. And another thing that have been happening also is that the there are many uh uh within our assembly also that have been having spiritual dreams you know spiritual dreams uh uh uh concerning the church and you know and concerning you know uh uh uh different things you know uh the ministry and all of that and and I think it's uh you know is it's a blessing and uh Uh Joy the prophet prophesied and said God will give dreams and vision in this day. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we believe that spiritual dreams is a gift to the church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a gift to the church and uh and we must cherish it. But in the same regard also we must guide it. We must keep it in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you see uh the the devil he he uh he likes to hide himself or impersonate what uh you know God has given to the people what's supposed to be a blessing to the people he he he likes to come and impersonate it. So most of the time you know when when brothers and sisters would tell me their dream and uh uh sometimes I would say write it down and give it to me sometimes uh uh but in most cases uh if if you will remember we sit and pray about it because I'm not an interpreter of dreams I don't have that gift I would just only advice and we would pray about it and uh uh and I was thinking about this you know I was thinking about this and I want to read this to you. That's the reason why I'm saying this. This this is from me straight is the gate. And then I went into the front uh the front room and sat down for a little while and it was about 3:30 to 4:00 in the morning. I got really sleepy and I went back and lied down and I dream a dream and it was the most odd dream and most of all uh and and most all of you know one of my managers Jack Moore and Jack Moore I have known him for years. I thought that I was out uh I thought that I was out with a date with his daughter, a girl about 17 years old, and I was taking her by the hand, leading her up the hill, little Jackie. Well, I I have known her since uh since uh she was just a nursing baby and I was leading her up the hill and I went three block, three block leading this girl and we came on a big tree and she sat down and Like a lot of the little teenagers, girls today wear their skirt and you know kind kind of bluff out and uh and she had on one of those kind of skirt and she took this little skirt and kind of spread it out and sat down. And as you young folks usually look at each other, she folded her hands like this and begin to look up towards the sky. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I went about five feet from her and kind of uh lie down sideways like this. And I got a straw and put it in my mouth and begin to chew it. And I begin to think, what am I doing up here? Why me an old man? And with this young girl, why? I said, I'm married. I have a bunch of children. I don't have any business up here with this young girl. He's becoming conscious in a dream. &gt;&gt; He's dreaming and becoming conscious. What what am I doing here? What is happening? But it's a dream. &gt;&gt; And I started to rise. And when I did, a voice came from the tree and said, "This is for a sign and for a cause." I woke up and I and I almost dream a nightmare. I thought, "Oh, wonder if that means that I'm going to backslide or something will happen to me." Now, you think about it. What will you think? This is a man that has had visions and and dreams in his life. Praise the Lord. right from uh being a being a child and uh uh uh but having this dream and coming to conscious in his dream that he's out with this young girl. He says, "What what's going on here?" You know, uh uh uh uh and then he came out of the dream and thinking, "Man, this wow, this is what's this a nightmare and what of that?" And then he's, you know, thinking in his mind, you know, being a believer, that happened to each and every one of us. What does that mean? Does that mean I'm going to backslide? That's that's this is this is brother Brand thinking now. This is the prophet of God thinking in his mind. What does it mean? Praise the Lord. Well, I thought if I go to try to use my own mind, then I will get it all mixed up. If I start to put reason to the dream, if I start to think it mean this or it mean that, I will get the whole thing mixed up. And then what will happen? It will create a complex in your human spirit. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Whether it is the person you dream about or whether even if it is yourself in the dream doing something that you're not supposed to do. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What I thought if I'm trying to use my own mind then I will get it all mix of soul. I will just wait on God. And I started praying. I said, "Lord, does that dream pertains to that vision just in the early part of the night or what does he means?" Praise the Lord. After waiting sometimes, maybe an hour, uh my wife was already up and had breakfast, read it, then the voice came back to me and said, "Go on to Kingston." and uh and it will be told you there what to do but still he's thinking in his mind this is his good friend Jack Mo does it mean something about the girl or uh uh but he was just more concerned about himself praise the Lord and the vision was yeah so he's uh not going giving us the interpretation And the vision was the little church. Now he's saying the vision was because now he has the interpretation to the dream. When you have a direct interpretation to a dream is no longer a dream. It's a vision because a v a a dream is a secondary vision. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the people that the people that have vision that are gifted to have vision, they don't go to sleep before they see things, they are wide open and also it drains them. They lose strength. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Daniel said he had to lay on his face many days after he saw those things in the book of Daniel. So now he's calling this a vision. Why? Because he has an interpretation. The vision was the little church. The girl was a virgin, just a child. And that meant the virgin said of the church. So he was going to Kingston for a revival. And it was going to be a three days revival. That's why they went three city block. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you see, you could stay in that mindset and the devil could bring all sorts of nasty thing to your mind either about yourself or about the girl. What what what is she's doing around me? You think about it. If you had a dream like that about me, what would you think? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you you can't use your mind to understand spiritual things. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the first thing we must do as children of God is stand still &gt;&gt; and commit it to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then now it becomes your personal battle. How are you going to direct your mind in that? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You dream I'm wearing a a a black hole and I'm running after you with axe in my hands and I'm coming to stand before you Sunday morning to preach. You are in a conflict in your mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean being humans until God help us. Praise the Lord. We are always driven to the negative. That's our fallen nature. We are always driven to look at things from the negative. Are we together? &gt;&gt; The girl was a virgin. that child and that that man the virgin of the church and the three city block up the hill was three days I will minister and and and and take the little virgin church by my ministry from where she was on higher in the things of God until it shook the entire island and this was not even Jackos church. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It's not like he was going to Jack Mo's church. This was not Jack Mo's church. But Jack Mo is his friend. Jackie is his friend's daughter. Praise the Lord. It's not like he's going to Louisiana to preach for Jack Mo and he's thinking about, oh, okay, maybe it's because I'm going there. I mean, she's she's not part of the meeting either. So spiritual things are spiritually discerned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. And when you learn to manage spiritual gift and go back to the giver and don't make it about you, &gt;&gt; you are getting ready for God to channel through that gift. when it start becoming of you. Oh yeah. The devil has a donkey to ride. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spiritual gifts, spiritual things are spiritually discerned. So uh uh and and and that's what I always encourage. What whatever it is, take it to the Lord and pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's bothering you and you can't handle it, share it with someone that you have confidence that you can pray about or can we talk about it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's just my encouragement to you this morning. Let's get back to our subject here that we want to talk about. Amen. Out of the mouth of babes and suckling have thou ordained strength because of thine enemy that thou that thou never steal the enemy in the adventure. Praise the Lord. And David David went went ahead and and he uh he he said this when uh when I consider the heavens the works of your hands. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Same God put uh the heavenly bodies there in in in uh in in in orbit. They they are stay at their position. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean the sun come out is couch and we can complain all we want. The sun will do its work. Because like David said in Psalm 19, the heavens declare the glory of God. &gt;&gt; They are there to declare God's glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So David said, "When I consider the heavens, the works of your hands, the works of your fingers, the moon and the star, which thou has ordained, you have also ordained them. You put them in their place. They are there for a purpose." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they have been faithful to their services. When I think about this, then David said, "Then what is man?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is man? You having the moon, you having the sun. The heaven declare the glory of God. The sun is able to to preach the gospel. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if the sun was to preach the gospel and it got so hot and said until you believe I'm not going to stop shining. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We get I mean we give our heart to the Lord because when the sun gets so high we say, "Oh, God, why is it so so hot?" Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet God ordained man to be his agent. &gt;&gt; What is man? What? What? What is it about mortal man? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to just travel with me this morning in this thought because this this was just my meditation. It was just something that I meditated on all through the week that God has ordained strength to steal the enemy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what we are dealing with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is strength that has been ordained to steal the enemy. Like brother Gideon said last night. Uh you know the power that's in the church is just the faith to use it. &gt;&gt; That's what we need. &gt;&gt; It's just that faith to be quickened &gt;&gt; to use the power. But the power is in the church. &gt;&gt; Because that's what he said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 10. Let's read. This is also familiar with us. We're coming right back there to uh Psalm chapter 8. Uh that will be our meditation for today. But Luke chapter 10, this is Jesus at the beginning of the of of the of the church, the beginning of uh the disciples. Amen. when he commissioned them to go out, the Bible say he sent them out uh uh you know to each to go out and uh and uh and the scripture says they returned back to him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They returned back to him. Verse 17, and the 17 return again with joy. They they returned back rejoicing. They returned back with joy saying,"Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name." Now, think about this. The Holy Ghost has not come yet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has not come yet. But yet these people sitting under the ministry of Jesus Christ here is it now they are experiencing going out and and and and and praying for sick people you know and casting out devils whatever they was experiencing there they came back all rejoicing. Amen. And no doubt I can believe that uh uh uh uh uh Judas perhaps was among them. You know, devils are subject unto us through thy name. And Jesus said, he said unto them, I beheld Satan as a lightning falling from heaven. Behold, I give unto you powers to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the powers of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And nothing shall by any means hurt you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "I've given it to you. I know exactly when you went out by vision. I could see the devil being subject to you." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because I've given you power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "But but praise the Lord." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we're standing in this rejoice net. Praise the Lord. I see you all are excited because you are having these things happening among you and and God is moving in your midst. But don't rejoice in that. Praise the Lord. Now we're standing in this. Rejoice now that spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rejoice to know that God has ordained you. &gt;&gt; Rejoice to know that you are predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are predestinated sons and daughters of God. Rejoice in what the father has already done. &gt;&gt; The grace that he has given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that's what you should rejoice in. Now verse 21, this is where my thought is. In that in that very hour Jesus also rejoice in the spirit. Think about it now. In that very hour, seeing that this man that has accompanied him, this man that has sat under his teaching, this man now are beginning to experience the the the the supernatural, they are beginning to enter into the promises. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, wouldn't that have been a good thing to see how he rejoice? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did he really just did he did like this &gt;&gt; or how did he rejoice? &gt;&gt; I thinking about it this morning. &gt;&gt; Did he just Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Man, &gt;&gt; I wonder how did he rejoice? &gt;&gt; Maybe he was not too much of an emotional person. &gt;&gt; Maybe it was just something down in his heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the scripture said he rejoiced. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And said, I thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know that that is the thing that rejoice the heart of a preacher &gt;&gt; when he sees the word in the life of the people. When he sees the people picking up the promises and standing for what is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; He said, "I thank I thank thee, oh Father, &gt;&gt; Lord of heaven, that thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent, and you have revealed them to babes." &gt;&gt; Now, so connect this now with Psalm. &gt;&gt; Connect it with what we just read in Psalm. These men, they were not, they were not sucking bottles. &gt;&gt; These men that Jesus was talking to, they were not wearing dappers. &gt;&gt; These were grown men. &gt;&gt; They had their own life. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I rejoice." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you have heard these things from the wise and prudent, and you have revealed them to babies. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you have a heart to learn, &gt;&gt; that's when that's when the father is attracted to you. &gt;&gt; He's about to take you on his breast and breast you because you have a heart to learn. &gt;&gt; You have reveals onto babies such that we learn. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says uh even so father for soul it seems good in your sight &gt;&gt; for soul it seems so good that is the thing that rejoice the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To see his children walking in truth &gt;&gt; to see his children rejoicing in his promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank thee, oh father, you have hid these things from the eyes and the pro of the wise and prudent and you are revealing them unto babes. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Strength that steals the enemy and the adventure. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Man, what a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you look through the scripture, you know, as I was as I was just thinking about this, I was thinking about what what could have been it. I was going through the mind of David, what what drew David to this place? What inspire him? And I look at the moons and the stars. I look at the heavenly bodies. Look at the mountains you have made. The trees. Job one time was looking at the tree. It died and it rise again. &gt;&gt; And he got an inspiration. I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; David said, "I look at the heavens. I know that you have ordained them. You have placed them. They have a purpose. They have a work. But what is man &gt;&gt; that you are so mindful &gt;&gt; of him? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is man that you are so mindful of him? The son of man that thou visited him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God visited. We we know in Genesis he visited Abraham. And I still believe that God visit us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He visit us. God can visit you in your prayer life. Amen. He can give you grace to to you know to to have a continuous prayer life. He can visit you in the word. He can visit you in your finances. He can visit you in your home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keeping your home in order. We're not doing about our strength and our intellect. &gt;&gt; He visit the sons of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you better know how to entertain him when he comes around. &gt;&gt; If you want to keep his presence, you have to learn how to be generous. &gt;&gt; Have the spirit of hospitality. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whenever you know he's around because whenever you entertain him, he never fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Abraham entertain him, he said, "But this time next year, &gt;&gt; Sarah will have a child." Amen. &gt;&gt; When the Shimite woman entertained the prophet, he said, "Ghesa, what is the need of this woman? Look around this house &gt;&gt; and tell me what is her need." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God visit. &gt;&gt; He still visit today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is man? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He even visit us with gift. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God God can give you a a a a spiritual dream and you see yourself in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's just a visitation to encourage you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He sent us a son of man ministry in this age. He visited our generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He visit Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We just need to have the spirit of hospitality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We just need to to to to to continuous have a welcoming spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he can visit you anytime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's this God. He's he's this guy that just he can just pass by in the neighborhood &gt;&gt; and just decide to stop. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe on your pole chain or he just decid to stop for the cup of drink or he just I mean you you just you think about the man on the road of Emas, he visited them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They said what manner of conversation you guys are having. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; First they started to blast. Are you a stranger here? You don't know what has happened. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then as they are going on, he started telling them about Moses said this and David said this in the psalm and and and and and at the end of the road, they said, "No, we can't let this guy go. &gt;&gt; Come and buy with us. &gt;&gt; We enjoy your company. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; God visit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are divine women. &gt;&gt; Amen. as a son of God, as a daughter of God &gt;&gt; that you can capitalize on, and your life will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your life will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't care if you believe it or not. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I was there when it happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I guess I should know. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord visited David at the backside of the desert. &gt;&gt; When a lion took his his uh his sheep or the bear talks his sheep, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I I want us to look in David's mind. What was he thinking about? What is man? What is man? mortal man born in sin ship in iniquity come to the world speaking lies &gt;&gt; but yet you have chosen us for sons and daughters &gt;&gt; yet you have chosen us to be a people to represent you in this most evil age &gt;&gt; what is man &gt;&gt; that thou are so mindful Your mind is so full of them. &gt;&gt; Thou are so mindful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. I'm just having a good time up here. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just having a good time up here. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, wonderful savior that we serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's uh he's just so good. Amen. He's so good. He's so good. He has never failed us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He has never never never failed us and he never will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory. Thou made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands. Now we will see that Paul the apostle would take on this subject over in the book of Hebrew when he will start talking to the Hebrew uh uh the Jewish believers trying to bring the mystery of Jesus to them trying to bring the God that spoke to our father in Sundra times in this last day he has spoken to us through his son. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring this mystery of Jesus to his people, the Jews, the Hebrew. That's what the book of Hebrew is all about. It's a book that is called the book of better things. Amen. More than seven times, Paul said in that book, a better thing. He gave us a better priesthood. He gave us a better sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have a better resurrection. We have a better promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the book of better things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Paul will capitalize on this very same psalm that the Jews has read over and over and over in uh in in their worship in in their synagogues. He will capitalize on this psalm to bring in the ministry of Jesus Christ. You remember that David said, "What is man that thou are so mindful that you make him a lower a little lower than the angels?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They are your sons and your daughters, but yet you made them a little lower than the angels. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels are they are they are our servants. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are there to serve God's children. &gt;&gt; They come about us. They build an incoming about us. &gt;&gt; They are there as God, as protectors towards God's children. But yet he has made us a little lower than the angels. In most cases, parents will not do that. Amen. We don't make the seven of the house higher than the children. The children are hearers of the house. Everything in the house belongs to them. But you see there is there is something mysterious that is playing out here. And that's what I want us to see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What is man &gt;&gt; that thou are mindful of him but yet you make him a little lower than the angel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You read you read Isaiah the Bible says that uh uh uh uh Lucifer Satan he was created perfect from the day he was created he was created perfect. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But when you and myself were was we were born we were born in imperfection. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see because our perfection is not from our birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our perfection is from a perfect God that made us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now think about it. Now, we talking about a strength that has been ordained to steal the enemy. That's a there's a strength that can keep Satan in his tracks. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can keep you right in his tracks and say, "Don't move. Stay right here and wait for me." &gt;&gt; Or you cannot come. You cannot come across this line. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can b me all my mind, but when I get to my door and I dust my feet, &gt;&gt; you stay with the dust. &gt;&gt; You can't enter this house because this house is on the talking. &gt;&gt; There is a strength &gt;&gt; that steals the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm glad you're feeling good this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I am. I'm feeling good. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Graham talks about a power that's lying in the church do. Amen. In uh in the in in the message uh uh Revelation, the book of SH symbols, he said, "Don't worry. God is waiting. He's trying and he's pressing to get at the mystery of God revealed to the church." He's pressing to get at the mystery of God revealed to the church. What actually is this? What is this mystery? What is what is this thing that he's pressing to get to us? &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the thing that he's pressing &gt;&gt; to get that reality to us &gt;&gt; that it is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is that great mystery of God and and God is waiting. He's trying. He pressing to get uh the mystery of God revealed to his church. That's what is holding back the coming of Christ now and the great me millennium &gt;&gt; is this great supernatural power that really lays dominant in the church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the the the the power of his his presence is uh is is is is in the church. &gt;&gt; When we look at this subject, we you can look at it and and and really appreciate it when you look at it in the types and the shadow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel were they were no they were not a match to the Egyptian army. The Egyptian army was one of the best army of their time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel was not a match. These people did they not had chariots. They were walking on their feet going to a promised land &gt;&gt; that Moses has come to preach to them. And Pharaoh and his men were determined. They were not determined to grab them and bring them back. After the the first born of the the the death of the first born of the Egyptians, the E the Egyptian army was planning to run over them with their cherubs. &gt;&gt; They were not planning to grab them and bring them back. &gt;&gt; They were so angry. Every family in Egypt has just lost their first born. &gt;&gt; Even Pharaoh has just lost his first born. So they were not coming there to plea with Moses. &gt;&gt; Please there is nobody to to to to make our breaks. Can you people? No. They were coming to run over them with their chariots. &gt;&gt; And these people were walking on their feet &gt;&gt; with their little ones &gt;&gt; and their animals. &gt;&gt; Think about it now. &gt;&gt; A strength that is ordained &gt;&gt; to steal &gt;&gt; the enemy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Before God gave Moses a message &gt;&gt; to tell them, "Let my people go." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go and tell Pharaoh to God has already ordained strength &gt;&gt; for a 40 days journey in the wilderness. He ordained strength for the older people. He ordained strength for the little ones. He ordained strength for the ones that were sick. &gt;&gt; He ordained strength for the babies that were born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can feel touch in my mind boiling &gt;&gt; like soup that is on the fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how I see touch in my mind body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When he told Abraham, "Your seed will sw and after 400 years I will bring them out." &gt;&gt; He has ordained strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every promise that God made, there is a strength behind that promise to bring it to pass. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Egyptians have they are they are chasing. They are not they are not slowing down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There was no speed limit to stop them. &gt;&gt; This was the king's command. The Hebrews can hear the wheels of the terror. They can see the dust in the air. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; David thinking out of the mouth of babes you have ordained strength. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A strength that will still &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, what a wonderful Jesus we serve. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you glad that God has ordained strength for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has ordained strength.

Don't go no further. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They are chasing, but they are going nowhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same strength is ordained for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whatever you think that is coming after you is not going anywhere &gt;&gt; because God has ordained strength. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know you. I I don't know. I I don't know you. I don't know what you think of what I'm saying this morning. I might be crazy, but I'm telling you, this scripture blessed me so much. &gt;&gt; I cry like a baby. &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, I read this over and over, and you just you just open a little window for me to see &gt;&gt; that thou has ordained strength &gt;&gt; for me. for me. &gt;&gt; Who am I? &gt;&gt; What is man? &gt;&gt; You are so mindful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about Jeff time. &gt;&gt; He was rejected because his mother was now part of the tribe. So he was cast out. But the God that ordained strength &gt;&gt; went for the rejected. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Went for the rejected. And the one that was rejected became the defender of Israel. &gt;&gt; Because God ordained strength. &gt;&gt; And the way that God ordained it is so mysterious &gt;&gt; that the people that come up, they are just like babes and suckling. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Chim guy was just like a babe and suckling. He took just an Oscar. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God ordained strength &gt;&gt; for him to deliver his household. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said enough is enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enough is enough over my dead body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will be dead before I see the Philistines abuse my people one more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was not a military man. Never went to a military school. Never got in a fight before. But God ordained strength. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the power is lying there. &gt;&gt; The power is lying there. It's lying dominant. It looks like nothing is happening. But Almighty God is working behind the scenes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's working behind the scenes. &gt;&gt; For what he has ordained to come to pass will surely come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says here over the mighty conqueror. He speaks about Adam race. He says, uh, "And Adam race was back up helpless, hopeless against the unccoming enemy, the devil in all of his host. Welltrained spirit being talking about demon powers now. Well, well trained spirit beings to know how your mind runs. Mhm. &gt;&gt; He know how your mind runs by the things you say. &gt;&gt; Oh, so your boy, I didn't even see you, young man. Yo, your mama dressed you in uh in uh Jacob. Uh it's a Joseph caught of many colors. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you, Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's so good. He's so good. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Adam race was back up, helpless, hopeless against the coming enemy. The devil and all his host, welltrained spirit beings. That's where I was dwelling on. It's just like science has proved it that he knows how our mind runs. It's just like that's what your phone use &gt;&gt; to know what you've been searching. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why as soon as you start to search it comes out &gt;&gt; because the phone has studed what you've been searching. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the same way the devil works. He know how your mind runs by the things you say. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Science just prove it to us that the devil knows how our mind runs by the things you say. He does not discern your heart. He does not have the gift of discernment. &gt;&gt; The devil can never discern your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the contrary, the Bible says the word is sharper than two edges swore piercing to this aunder of your heart, discerning your thoughts and intents. &gt;&gt; So it's the word that discern your heart. &gt;&gt; The devil only knows what is on your mind by the thing you confess, &gt;&gt; the things you say. So he's a welltrained enemy. That's how he broke into Eden by studying. He tried everything. Amen. He find that channel of reasoning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That channel of I wonder why God said this. That channel, that wonderland. When you enter the Wonderland, you know Wonderland. Praise the Lord. Whoever has traveled to Wonderland. &gt;&gt; I've been in Wonderland. I've traveled to Wonderland. I used to be a child that lives in my head. Praise the Lord. In my head, I would go to Japan. I would shopping. I would travel when I didn't even have a damn to buy something to eat. But I'll be I'll be in Wonderland. Praise the Lord. Amen. So you see we have a world training an enemy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He watch how our mind runs by the things we say. So he says a welltrained spirit being the mortal was no match to them at all. &gt;&gt; We are no match. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we have strength that is ordained. &gt;&gt; We might be no match to the devil this morning, &gt;&gt; but we have strength that is ordained. &gt;&gt; If we go down on our knees, we have strength that rain down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I might be no match to the devil. &gt;&gt; I'm not counting on my ability. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at what has been ordained for me. My name on the Lamb book of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's what I'm trying for. I'm I'm I'm trying for us to make deposit in our faith bank this morning. Not depending on our ability, but let's put some things in our faith banks. Looking at the promise. &gt;&gt; Counting on the ability of him that have promised. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we need faith to use the power. &gt;&gt; The power is here. We need faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So don't don't allow your your faith bank to just be dry. &gt;&gt; Build up your faith bank &gt;&gt; because faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just let make some deposit in our faith bank this morning. Say thank you Lord for giving me power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For oraining power, oraining strength &gt;&gt; that will steal the enemy. &gt;&gt; Even in my mind, you can steal the enemy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my, I'm feeling so good this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank God I left Daniel a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God I left building in troublesome time. I mean this morning I was just I was so honored that burden this morning. Went to pray and uh you know the Lord just changed the direction. I'm feeling so good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are no match. No match. No matter what what is our our our financial strength and and what is our uh uh level of education, we are no match to the enemy. &gt;&gt; No match. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The man that God promised Solomon, &gt;&gt; do you realize that was even in a dream? &gt;&gt; That God told Solomon, "I'll give you wisdom." Yes. &gt;&gt; When you read the Bible, it was in a dream. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And God told him, "I will bless you. &gt;&gt; I will give you wisdom." You mean, can you imagine? In his dream, he's praying. &gt;&gt; In his dream, he's thinking. This people is such a great people. How am I going to lead him? &gt;&gt; Can you can you imagine the kind of a dream of a father &gt;&gt; thinking about his children and he's dreaming about it? or a mother thinking about her household. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You mean you were thinking about it so much that it infiltrated into your subconscious &gt;&gt; and say you dreaming about it &gt;&gt; and God comes down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And said I will bless you. &gt;&gt; I'll give you wisdom like no man has had. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he was the wisest man. &gt;&gt; Just like I said, &gt;&gt; something that he did not labor for. God in his mercy &gt;&gt; gave him a kingdom that was free. David has fought all the wars. And David has made peace with all the enemies around. Solomon had nothing to worry about. &gt;&gt; God has visited him and say I will bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will give you wisdom, understanding and beyond that I will give you the wealth of this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But yet he choose to use his human mind &gt;&gt; for his own security. Can't you believe that the God that give you what you have &gt;&gt; is able to protect you? &gt;&gt; If God gave you your family, &gt;&gt; he's able to protect you because I believe there is strength that is ordained &gt;&gt; to keep your home on the talking. There is strength that is ordained for you to raise your children in the Lord. &gt;&gt; But Solomon tried to use his wisdom. Now he want to protect himself more than how God will protect him. &gt;&gt; So if I take wife from all of this nation, &gt;&gt; they will not fight me. &gt;&gt; He's that his wisdom now his human mind. &gt;&gt; He's trying to protect himself. I will take the Egyptian daughter. They will not come here because their daughter live in this house. I will take the Syrian daughter. And he was going for all the king's children. So as soon as they want to fight you say no my daughter is in that place you don't go that Solomon mind Solomon protecting himself &gt;&gt; and that same kind of mind enslave him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because when he go on this side this one is burning incense. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. She get a bowl of water that she sprinkling oil around. &gt;&gt; I know. I'm not I'm not good in dramatizing because I get caught up into laughing. Amen. And this other one is sprinkling seeds all over the place. They all brought their father idols. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And the thing that was freely given to him. &gt;&gt; Wow. The thing that he never fought for, &gt;&gt; we never fought to be safe. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There was no effort of us to believe this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't defend the message. &gt;&gt; Stay behind it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Stay behind it. We are no match to this last day spirit &gt;&gt; because we have seen men that has preached this thing for 40 years &gt;&gt; flipping their Bibles. Yes. &gt;&gt; Some are no longer in church this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are no long we are no match to this devil. He have dealt with great men all around. You you you think think now think the same thing about uh about Samson. That was exactly what he did. a gift that was freely given to him to deliver the people. &gt;&gt; Brother B said he was not a man of muscles, &gt;&gt; but every time the Bible says when the spirit of the Lord comes upon him &gt;&gt; and he just shake that lots on his head, &gt;&gt; he just had to put his head his hand through his head and touched the Lord. &gt;&gt; It connected him with the coveting. It was a sign of hair shape. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know many many young people are are trying to grow raster hair because they want to be something. But what it means, he was under a hairship. He was under a covenant. That what it meant. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's the same way God has put us under the hair shape of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why we are not ashamed to say the prophet's head because what we doing? We putting our hands through the lot. &gt;&gt; We are trying to touch the seven &gt;&gt; lot. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But you see just from that little child, God God ordained strength so much that the name of Samson terrified. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It terrified the Egypt I mean the the the Philistine. They just had to say something is coming. Brother Bar says they put their babies to bed &gt;&gt; by saying something is coming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When a wife don't want to her husband to go out at night, she say, "I heard something is coming." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says, "Where you hear it from?" You can hear all sorts of things. Where you heard it from? I don't I they were saying in the marketplace when I went to buy market they said something was coming. &gt;&gt; Well I didn't I didn't read it in the paper. My friends then never told me well if you want to go I'm just telling you something is coming. So that something is coming. Stop playing on his mind. Let me just go home. But it was God oraining strength. Yeah, &gt;&gt; in the mouth of babes and suckling. &gt;&gt; He was just a kind of a linking man. But when the spirit of the Lord comes upon him, he even picks up a wall, a gate. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the Bible says there is no temptation. There is no trial &gt;&gt; that comes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To you as a child of God, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; that will overtake you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God has ordained strength &gt;&gt; for you to go through there. &gt;&gt; He has ordained strength &gt;&gt; to keep you &gt;&gt; in the midst of your trials. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job could not curse the Lord. He didn't understand why he was going through. &gt;&gt; But yeah, he couldn't curse girl. Yeah, he he said, "Thou art righteous than me." How can you bring a fallen man born into sin? &gt;&gt; How God, but God ordained strength. He was the same one that told the devil, "Have you considered my seven job?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God has called out your name, he has ordained strength to keep you in your trials. &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; He's a mighty God. &gt;&gt; He's a God that is strong. He's our defender. So let's finish this uh mighty conquering quote here and I will try to close there on you. Maybe I continue this evening or just bring you an hesitation. And Adam race was back up helpless hopeless against the oncoming enemy the devil and all his host well-trained spirit being and mortal was no match at all no match for them at all and they and what could they do? They were helpless. But there was one who stepped out of glory &gt;&gt; from the bosom of the father and he said I will I I go down this day and I give my life &gt;&gt; for Adam I am fully raised. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is our strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's my peace &gt;&gt; that has broken down every wall. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Musicians, you can come. strength that steals the enemy. That's why all of these men that Paul spoke about in Hebrew, the scripture says in their weakness, they were strong because there was strength that was ordained for them. And I believe that strength is also ordained for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. strength is ordained for us in this hour when it seems like nothing is happening. Remember, we've been talking for a while now on how God built in trouble time. God built in difficult time. Praise the Lord. He love to do that. He love to take the enemy by surprise. When the devil thinks that he have uh destroyed God's people or conquered God's people, God step right in there. [Music] [Music] What are you playing? [Music] Word is the alarm. So you play. Okay. [Music] Let's just worship the Lord a little bit. [Music] Worthy the lamb that was slain. Worthy. Oh, thou are worthy. [Music] Word is the lamb thou was slain. We sing worthy, worthy, worthy.

Cast all my cares on you. For he careth for me. [Music] He is my peace. He is my peace. Think about it this morning. Now, you think about it this morning. If God ordained strength to steal the enemy, you have to remember that it's not because of your goodness. It is not because of our righteousness. is nothing that we have done. It's all because of his internal purpose. It's because you are a son of God. Because you are a daughter of God. That's why he ordained peace. He ordained strength. He ordained righteousness. He ordained deliverance. He can bring you out. God has ordained healing that was before the foundation of the world. He was wounded for our transgression. He was bruised for our iniquity. I cast my care on him. He caring for me. [Music] He is my peace. He is my peace. [Music] He is my peace. He has broken down every wall. He is my peace. He is my peace. He is my peace. Who has broken down every wall. He is my peace. He is my peace. Peace of God cover me. [Music] If God has ordained strength is because he want you to be in peace. He want you to trust him. No matter what your body might be going through, no matter the mind battles that you might be going through, no matter what the enemy is trying to, the lies that he's speaking to your mind or is speaking through your body, [Music] covers me. Covers me. Oh, covers me. [Music] And peace of God covers me. Oh, through the storm. covers me. [Music] Let's sing that again. And peace of God covers me. If you want to stand, you are welcome. Covers me. Oh, covers me. [Music] Oh peace of God covers me through this star, [Music] covers me only in you and only [Music] Only you &gt;&gt; I'll seek you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.

Only in you I found peace. God loves me. God loves me. [Music] Let's bow our heads and pray. [Music] I pray that God speaks to your heart this morning. I pray that he encouraged you [Music] just to know that before we got here, Brother Brandham said a parent before they will have their child and make preparation. They will buy this and they will buy all the necessary things to realize that before we got here, before we got to this laudish age, before we got to this evil age, God has made preparation. He has ordained men to preach to us. He has ordained people to lead us in worship. He has ordained brothers and sisters to encourage us along the way. [Music] He also has given his angel charge over us. I want for us this afternoon to just look in David's mind. He said, "You have ordained the heavens, the works of your hands. You have ordained it. But what is man that you are so mindful of him?" And God has been mindful of us. He has ordained strength even at a time while we were yet sinners. He have ordained strength to take us out of difficult situation. He has ordained strength that has brought us this far in our struggles, in our failures. He has ordained a voice to speak to our heart that you can still hear the small state voice calling to your heart, condemning you in the things that is wrong, encouraging you in the things that is right. Everything that we need for our joining, God has ordained it. We have a full package [Music] this morning. If we can just put into our faith bank, Lord, I love you. Father, I thank you. Lord, I appreciate the things that you have provided. to keep us Lord in this journey as it gets tough as a a a spiritual warfare war against us. But you have ordained strength to steal the enemy. Sometimes we go through horrible things and it looks like your faith is filled. It looks like you have thrown in the towel. Sometimes it seems like um the message is not making sense to you or whatever it is. But almighty God comes around. Stranger has been ordained and you find yourself picking yourself up again, picking your Bible up. A desire spring in your heart to get back to church because God has ordained strength. It is not by our power. It is not by our might but God has ordained strength to help us in whatever area of our life. He has ordained strength to steal the enemy. He stopped the enemy right in his stripes and said this is my son. This is my daughter. If we can just only call on the Lord. If we can just only lift our heads up onto the hills and say, "Oh God, [Music] heavenly father, Almighty God, we just want to thank you Lord God. We thank you this afternoon, Father God, and for just allowing us to fellowship around this thought, Lord, to know that God, you did not only predestinate us, Lord, you did not only ordain us from the foundation of the word, but you also ordained everything that is going to take care of us. And oh God, this morning Lord, Father, that's the reason why we're trying to encourage your children. Lord, we are safe in the arms of Jesus. We are safe because everything that we need for this joining, God has provided and he has given his angels charge over us. Father, we just thank you this afternoon. We give you the praise. We give you the glory and honor, oh God. We want to just be so grateful and thankful to you, Lord God, for bringing us together, Lord, and and just blessing the Sabbath this morning, Father.

Oh God, oh Father, something they can hold to, Lord God. and know that Lord, you promise that you would never leave us. You never forsake us. And you have never done it. You have never done it, Lord.
