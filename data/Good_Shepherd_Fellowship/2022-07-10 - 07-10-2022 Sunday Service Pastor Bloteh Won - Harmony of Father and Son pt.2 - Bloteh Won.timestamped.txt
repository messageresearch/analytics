[46:21] they followed the lord
[46:23] you know with all their hearts and
[46:26] they
[46:27] met
[46:28] and
[46:29] they came together they felt they were
[46:31] in love so they went to the priest and
[46:34] and they got married you know and
[46:37] so they were serving the lord and they
[46:39] were faithful and you know when you're a
[46:40] young married couple then
[46:43] you like to have some children
[46:45] so
[46:46] they prayed and
[46:48] children didn't come right away
[46:52] but they still prayed and they were
[46:53] still faithful
[46:55] and then one day
[46:57] the wife she went to the husband and she
[46:59] said i'm with child
[47:01] and
[47:02] so they rejoiced and the church rejoiced
[47:04] everybody was happy you know it's a
[47:06] wonderful thing
[47:08] and when the child was born then they
[47:10] were happy that a son had come into the
[47:13] world and and they they took care of him
[47:16] like you would for a newborn baby and
[47:18] everything else but they noticed there
[47:19] was something peculiar about this child
[47:22] and as time went on
[47:24] they realized that
[47:26] the baby was blind
[47:29] and you know how why would god even do
[47:32] something like that to a young couple
[47:35] you know that love one another and and
[47:37] they want to be good parents and
[47:39] everything else but
[47:41] their child was blind
[47:44] so they gave that child all the love
[47:48] and they raised him up
[47:56] and one day
[47:59] he come to you know he come
[48:02] he he served the lord he he gave his
[48:04] heart to the lord and
[48:06] and but he was still blind you know and
[48:08] then he grew up and
[48:10] and one day his parents sat down and
[48:12] they told him they said well son
[48:15] you
[48:16] you have to make a way for yourself in
[48:17] this world you you have to do this
[48:20] and
[48:22] he said well what what can i do i'm
[48:25] blind and they said well we'll we'll
[48:27] take you down and we'll find you a place
[48:29] there's a place at the by the city gate
[48:33] there's a place where you can sit and
[48:35] and the people that are more affluent
[48:37] that have good things
[48:40] and that's what isn't jehovah good to me
[48:42] and yes he is he's he's given you a good
[48:45] life but now you have to make a way and
[48:48] and just so they found a place for him
[48:50] to sit by the city gate
[48:52] and
[48:53] and he sat there and
[48:55] and people that had money and that
[48:58] they
[48:59] would you know give him a little
[49:01] offering in that so he could buy himself
[49:03] some food or some clothes and
[49:06] and but he was still faithful
[49:08] he still was faithful
[49:11] one day
[49:13] a great man came by
[49:17] he came by with his disciples
[49:20] and his disciples
[49:22] his disciples they looked at him and
[49:24] they said
[49:25] master
[49:27] oh sinned
[49:30] was it because the parents were bad
[49:32] parents
[49:34] was it because their grandparents were
[49:37] bad people
[49:39] that this man was born blind
[49:45] and jesus looked at them and he said no
[49:48] brothers
[49:50] no
[49:52] this man
[49:54] was born blind
[49:56] that the works of god
[49:59] might be made manifest
[50:01] in him
[50:03] praise god amen

[55:06] over the years brother steve cassidy has
[55:09] uh uh still serve as a trustee and a

[55:22] uh brother jordan

[55:28] of the church administrators
[55:29] to get on the trusty board

[56:22] if there is anyone that
[56:25] self in this church that is a member of
[56:27] this church that support this church

[56:32] that have anything
[56:35] any reservation for brother jordan to
[56:37] serve as a trustee
[56:39] may you just do there by the raising up
[56:41] of your hands
[56:45] if you do not want blood jordan to be a
[56:47] trustee if you have a reason why you
[56:50] think he's now qualified to be a trustee
[56:54] you can do there by the raising up of
[56:55] your hands

[1:05:16] of the father and son something brother
[1:05:18] branham referenced
[1:05:20] in the church-ish book
[1:05:22] which of course he says such harmony
[1:05:24] that uh existed between the father and
[1:05:26] the son would be the scene between the
[1:05:28] bride
[1:05:29] and the groom
[1:05:31] and uh
[1:05:36] so we we want to continue in that
[1:05:38] thought

[1:05:42] that i will i will want to endured on my
[1:05:45] father my father the chair of israel
[1:05:49] and the houseman there of

[1:05:58] first king
[1:06:03] chapter 18
[1:06:07] verse 41
[1:06:10] and elijah said unto ahab get thee up
[1:06:13] eat and drink
[1:06:15] for there is a sound of abundance of
[1:06:18] rain
[1:06:19] amen
[1:06:20] are you hearing the sound of abundance
[1:06:22] of rain
[1:06:24] praise the lord
[1:06:25] amen the windows of heaven are open
[1:06:29] his blessings are falling
[1:06:31] so ahab went up to eat and drink and
[1:06:34] elijah went up to the top of of camel
[1:06:37] and he
[1:06:38] cast himself down upon the earth and put
[1:06:42] his face between his knees
[1:06:45] and said to his seven
[1:06:47] go up now look towards
[1:06:50] the sea
[1:06:51] and he went up and looked
[1:06:54] and said there is nothing and he said go
[1:06:57] again seven times
[1:06:59] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:07:02] that he said behold
[1:07:04] there rise a cloud out of the sea like a
[1:07:08] man's hand
[1:07:11] and he said go up say unto aha prepared
[1:07:15] that chariot and get thee down
[1:07:18] that the rain
[1:07:22] stopped being net
[1:07:24] and it came to pass
[1:07:28] in the meanwhile that the heaven was
[1:07:31] black
[1:07:32] with clouds and wind and there was a
[1:07:36] great rain
[1:07:37] and a half rolled and went to israel
[1:07:42] and the hand of the lord now listen to
[1:07:44] this now the hand of the lord was
[1:07:48] only larger
[1:07:50] and he gave up his land and ran before
[1:07:54] ahab told the entrance
[1:07:57] of jezreel
[1:07:58] ahab is on the chariot but yet elijah
[1:08:02] have more speed
[1:08:05] than ahab
[1:08:07] elijah is running
[1:08:09] ahab is on the chariot
[1:08:11] but elijah gets to the gate
[1:08:14] before ahab
[1:08:16] praise the lord
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:20] second king chapter 2 verse 12.
[1:08:25] second king chapter 2 verse 12.
[1:08:41] praise the lord
[1:08:46] second king chapter 2 verse 12.
[1:09:00] verse 11 and it came to pass
[1:09:02] as they still went on that's elijah and
[1:09:05] elijah and talk
[1:09:07] and behold there appeared a cherry of
[1:09:09] fire
[1:09:10] in the nurses of fire and potted them
[1:09:13] both as sunder
[1:09:16] it might have just
[1:09:17] ran between them and elijah
[1:09:20] went up
[1:09:22] by a whale went into heaven and elijah
[1:09:24] saw it
[1:09:25] and he cried my father my father
[1:09:29] the chariot of ezra
[1:09:31] and the horsemen thereof and he saw him
[1:09:35] normal
[1:09:37] and he took hold of his own cloth and
[1:09:40] ran
[1:09:41] them
[1:09:42] in two pieces
[1:09:45] father your blessed word has been read
[1:09:49] and this morning we just want to trust
[1:09:51] you
[1:09:52] that something of internal value
[1:09:55] will be said lord
[1:09:57] there are a lot of things that could be
[1:09:58] said that would take out our mind
[1:10:00] father in an intellectual way
[1:10:03] but that thing of internal value
[1:10:06] that's what our soul will feed on
[1:10:09] speak to us out of your word this
[1:10:11] morning
[1:10:12] in jesus name we pray
[1:10:14] amen the lord bless you you may have
[1:10:16] your seat
[1:10:17] if uh brother ben i mean brother dan
[1:10:20] would just come and help me
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:26] praise the lord
[1:10:28] and we just uh
[1:10:30] we just uh
[1:10:31] want to thank the lord
[1:10:34] uh
[1:10:36] now i want you to notice something just
[1:10:38] just take this back there
[1:10:40] before you disturb us this
[1:10:42] morning and uh
[1:10:46] wednesday night when we were speaking
[1:10:48] about uh uh uh david lamettin over the
[1:10:52] death of jonathan and saul the bible
[1:10:54] says
[1:10:55] uh
[1:10:56] he rented his clothes
[1:10:59] and if you realize here also elisha did
[1:11:02] the same thing
[1:11:06] amen amen he did the same thing he
[1:11:08] rented his clothes
[1:11:10] if we were back up a little bit and what
[1:11:12] we were trying to show wednesday night
[1:11:14] you know out of the word is that uh we
[1:11:16] were talking on the the harmony between
[1:11:19] the father and the son and we were
[1:11:22] trying to look at the relationship that
[1:11:24] existed between david
[1:11:26] and saul
[1:11:29] and if it was not because of
[1:11:31] david lament
[1:11:33] we would never be able to have a grains
[1:11:36] into some of the positive things that
[1:11:38] saul did
[1:11:42] praise the lord
[1:11:43] because uh the the bible in first samuel
[1:11:46] just told us a little bit of of what he
[1:11:49] did and and from the from the singing of
[1:11:51] the ladies we we heard that he killed a
[1:11:54] thousand and and and uh and dedicate ten
[1:11:57] thousand whether they made that up or
[1:11:59] you know uh or they just said it for the
[1:12:02] fact that david destroyed uh uh goliath
[1:12:06] in the in the army of the the uh
[1:12:08] philistines ran away but we whichever
[1:12:11] way is that that was just a little
[1:12:13] insight that they saw has some victory
[1:12:16] but when we came down to to david
[1:12:18] lamenting over the death of saul we
[1:12:21] realized that david expressed
[1:12:24] all daughters of jerusalem amen
[1:12:27] don't let it be heard
[1:12:30] he said because this man ministry
[1:12:33] clothed you
[1:12:36] he clothed you yes right amen praise the
[1:12:40] lord
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:42] amen
[1:12:46] he said how
[1:12:48] sword and journeytown was very pleasing
[1:12:52] in their lives
[1:12:53] yes
[1:12:55] they were very pleasant we we we turned
[1:12:58] to see all the negative things because
[1:13:00] we are so easy to give that way that's
[1:13:02] our fallen nature we can't help it
[1:13:06] we can help it it's so easy for us to
[1:13:08] gear
[1:13:09] into seeing the negative thing and if
[1:13:11] god does not help are we only stuck in
[1:13:13] the negative things
[1:13:15] and we don't see nothing good about that
[1:13:17] person
[1:13:18] he said david and saul were very
[1:13:21] pleasant in their life david stayed i
[1:13:24] mean so in journalism david stayed in
[1:13:27] the house of saul
[1:13:29] amen they never kept him in the band he
[1:13:31] was in the royal palace he had this he
[1:13:34] ate at the king's table
[1:13:40] they had a relationship as father and
[1:13:43] son
[1:13:46] and that's the reason why when david cut
[1:13:48] off his garment and went on the hill and
[1:13:50] says see i have your gun he said my son
[1:13:53] he felt it in his heart he said my son
[1:14:00] that was a relationship that was between
[1:14:02] them
[1:14:05] and what he also said and also
[1:14:07] identified is that
[1:14:10] both of them there were in their life
[1:14:13] david said
[1:14:15] they were swift like eagles
[1:14:17] strong like lion
[1:14:20] and that is true identity
[1:14:22] of the living creatures around the
[1:14:24] throne
[1:14:26] so in the allies they have the alpha and
[1:14:28] the omega anointing
[1:14:33] because that's what it takes
[1:14:36] for god to lead his people
[1:14:38] god will call a man and back the man up
[1:14:41] with one of those anointing
[1:14:44] so every god gave him man whether it was
[1:14:47] jeremiah whether it was down here
[1:14:49] every one of them will honor one of
[1:14:51] those anointing
[1:14:55] because it's not the man that does the
[1:14:57] work is the anointing that does the work
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:02] are we together so yeah yeah yeah the uh
[1:15:06] uh uh david
[1:15:08] giving us an insight
[1:15:10] but realized that
[1:15:13] it took a lamentation
[1:15:17] that's what happened when a cry comes
[1:15:19] from the soul
[1:15:21] you ought of things
[1:15:24] you offer things
[1:15:29] that become pleasing to god
[1:15:35] all right it's not a crowd where you
[1:15:37] want for everybody to hear what you what
[1:15:39] you're going through
[1:15:40] oh my god i know i'm dying my people are
[1:15:42] dying i'm dying
[1:15:46] you are not there you are not dead yet
[1:15:49] amen
[1:15:54] but if you look through the scripture
[1:15:55] you will realize
[1:15:57] it was it it was something it was it's a
[1:16:01] it's a pattern of god
[1:16:04] verb says those hebrew mothers in in
[1:16:07] childbirth
[1:16:09] when when when they when when they are
[1:16:11] travailing to bring forth they cry the
[1:16:14] strength to god
[1:16:17] and then they they say words
[1:16:20] beyond their imagination
[1:16:26] praise the lord
[1:16:28] so also you will see it
[1:16:30] here
[1:16:32] in in in the scripture
[1:16:35] that whenever
[1:16:36] uh uh uh uh a prophet or or a man or you
[1:16:40] know uh uh just like we're looking at
[1:16:42] year and when when when he's lamented
[1:16:45] after there are things that i said
[1:16:50] that identify
[1:16:53] the ministry of the man
[1:16:55] that's one we want to look at this
[1:16:57] morning
[1:16:58] when when elijah said my father my
[1:17:00] father
[1:17:02] the chariot of israel
[1:17:04] what was he saying
[1:17:11] what was he saying was he referring to
[1:17:14] the the the chair that took elisha out
[1:17:16] no
[1:17:17] i don't believe so
[1:17:21] i don't believe so
[1:17:24] praise the lord
[1:17:27] i don't believe so i believe
[1:17:29] elijah
[1:17:32] was so affected
[1:17:35] by the ministry of elijah there were
[1:17:37] things that he saw
[1:17:41] there were things that he saw he was
[1:17:44] right there on my camel
[1:17:47] when he saw fire coming down from heaven
[1:17:49] amen
[1:17:54] he was the one that saw
[1:17:56] the the the cloud like a man's hand
[1:18:01] when the whole heavens was was just like
[1:18:03] a brass
[1:18:07] by elijah telling him
[1:18:09] go
[1:18:11] i see abundance of rain
[1:18:14] he went he still saw the brazing cloud
[1:18:17] he came back and said nothing
[1:18:20] says go back again do it seven times boy
[1:18:26] and as as you know as he was doing it he
[1:18:29] could see the changes
[1:18:30] he was paying attention
[1:18:35] he was not he was not just confirming
[1:18:38] himself
[1:18:39] but he was paying attention because he
[1:18:41] knows
[1:18:43] his father
[1:18:45] has spoken
[1:18:50] praise the lord
[1:18:52] he know that his father
[1:18:55] has spoken which of course
[1:18:57] it was not his literal father
[1:19:01] but he have come under
[1:19:03] the ministry of this man
[1:19:06] that
[1:19:09] he became a son
[1:19:14] to elijah
[1:19:17] by the order of the ministry
[1:19:20] are we together
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:24] praise the lord
[1:19:27] my father my father
[1:19:32] the chariot of israel
[1:19:37] and the husband thereof
[1:19:41] now so we realize here as we will look
[1:19:44] into this
[1:19:45] this morning
[1:19:53] believing that
[1:19:55] the lord that have always been our help
[1:20:00] he will help us this
[1:20:02] morning praise the lord
[1:20:20] well thank you uh brother ben and sister
[1:20:22] alice for having us yesterday
[1:20:25] and uh we just
[1:20:27] appreciate the time of fellowship amen
[1:20:30] praise the lord
[1:20:33] hallelujah
[1:20:35] now
[1:20:36] as we look at this together
[1:20:39] you realize the other
[1:20:42] if you look at this aspect of elijah
[1:20:44] referring to elijah as father
[1:20:49] it holds
[1:20:52] a natural disposition
[1:20:58] for the nature the road of a father
[1:21:02] praise the lord
[1:21:08] elijah was acknowledging
[1:21:12] the great save guy
[1:21:16] of elijah
[1:21:18] the elijah
[1:21:21] being in israel elijah as as the man of
[1:21:25] god the prophet of god right there he
[1:21:27] was acknowledging
[1:21:30] a safe guard
[1:21:34] that by this man because we have to
[1:21:36] realize that it was a period of time
[1:21:38] where the uh how they caught it now a
[1:21:41] period of time where
[1:21:43] uh
[1:21:46] jesse bear religion has taken over the
[1:21:49] land yes amen
[1:21:51] amen amen
[1:21:53] and to see a man on the scene
[1:21:57] that was calling the people back to
[1:21:59] jehovah
[1:22:00] calling the people back to the lord god
[1:22:03] of israel
[1:22:04] and he said lord i have done all of
[1:22:07] these things are calling to your word
[1:22:09] yes let the fire fall
[1:22:12] amen
[1:22:14] praise the lord
[1:22:17] so
[1:22:18] eli elisha
[1:22:20] have identified
[1:22:22] safety that was in the prophet
[1:22:27] are we together
[1:22:34] now the reason why i read those two
[1:22:38] verses or out of those two chapter
[1:22:41] first king and second king was to be
[1:22:43] able to give you a little bit of an idea
[1:22:47] and uh
[1:22:49] elijah or elastic
[1:22:53] with what he saw
[1:22:56] that a man
[1:22:58] who i run
[1:23:00] chariot
[1:23:02] now you have to realize
[1:23:05] that ahab terror
[1:23:07] was just like
[1:23:11] it was
[1:23:13] the president
[1:23:14] motoke
[1:23:18] amen the one of the united states they
[1:23:19] call it the beast
[1:23:21] yes
[1:23:23] praise the lord amen
[1:23:25] they give him
[1:23:27] the finest cherub
[1:23:30] the best protected is
[1:23:32] is you have
[1:23:33] uh uh uh the best speed above every
[1:23:37] other chariot
[1:23:39] because it's used for safety to get him
[1:23:41] out when there is trouble
[1:23:48] the lord
[1:23:49] that's the reason why when the children
[1:23:51] of israel saw
[1:23:54] a
[1:23:55] pharaoh cherub behind him
[1:23:58] they just thought they were dead they
[1:24:00] knew that they were out they would those
[1:24:02] those hearses and cheryl would just run
[1:24:05] over them amen
[1:24:07] because this is just not an honor this
[1:24:09] is the president this is the king
[1:24:18] and when is the king
[1:24:20] his his chariot is not going to be
[1:24:23] behind
[1:24:24] no he had to lead right he have two men
[1:24:28] by his side and he's the one leading
[1:24:30] nobody can overrun him right amen
[1:24:33] so they the children of israel clearly
[1:24:35] saw that this was pharaoh coming after
[1:24:38] them amen
[1:24:42] trying to create a picture here in your
[1:24:44] mind
[1:24:45] so with ahab getting on his chair
[1:24:50] and elijah saying ron
[1:24:52] reign is coming
[1:24:57] praise the lord
[1:25:00] and ahab took up and started let's go
[1:25:02] gentlemen
[1:25:07] the president motorcade get on the road
[1:25:09] everybody clear the road
[1:25:10] if you stand before it they just hit you
[1:25:13] and go
[1:25:14] no investigation
[1:25:16] the president motorcade does not stop
[1:25:18] for you to cross the road
[1:25:21] you feel like his life is more important
[1:25:24] than any other life
[1:25:26] that's the reason why they will block
[1:25:28] every street because they don't want no
[1:25:30] interference they are not going to stop
[1:25:33] right amen
[1:25:38] i mean i
[1:25:39] uh uh ahab drum out of his house
[1:25:42] shadow his man they are running
[1:25:45] because they can all see the clouds
[1:25:48] praise the lord amen
[1:25:51] elijah get up it's a boy i'll see you
[1:25:55] come and meet me in
[1:25:57] jezreel
[1:25:58] praise the lord oh boy headed prophet
[1:26:01] how much can he run
[1:26:06] praise the lord before aha realized he
[1:26:09] said
[1:26:10] i see you
[1:26:11] come and meet me
[1:26:15] i'm trying to give you a picture
[1:26:20] of the speed on a which god work
[1:26:29] the way he changed a sinner to sin
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:34] the way he takes habit out of our life
[1:26:38] is more than the time that the surgeon
[1:26:44] will operate to take tumor
[1:26:46] from your body
[1:26:52] praise the lord
[1:26:54] the way god
[1:26:56] can turn things around
[1:27:01] he does not operate in the same speed
[1:27:05] that we do
[1:27:06] amen
[1:27:08] no he does not
[1:27:12] are we together
[1:27:18] praise the lord
[1:27:22] so i i just want us to to picture that
[1:27:24] in our mind because that's what we want
[1:27:26] to do here this this morning because
[1:27:29] most of the time we think that you know
[1:27:31] we we know one another we come here to
[1:27:34] church we know what i know what is
[1:27:36] happening down there people say that i
[1:27:38] know what that church is offer you don't
[1:27:39] have no idea
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:49] you don't have no idea
[1:27:52] oh nothing is happening down there oh no
[1:27:54] nothing just bunch of hypocrites you are
[1:27:56] the hypocrite
[1:28:03] because god
[1:28:04] do not work in our time domain
[1:28:08] and god do not move
[1:28:10] by our speed limit in a car
[1:28:15] the way god
[1:28:17] move and work
[1:28:22] it's different amen
[1:28:27] praise the lord
[1:28:29] so i just want us to be in that mindset
[1:28:31] this morning because that's where we're
[1:28:33] going to travel as we as we talk about
[1:28:35] this uh uh father and son you see that's
[1:28:38] why jesus said the song could do nothing
[1:28:42] except what the father show him because
[1:28:45] when the father have shown him it's
[1:28:47] already done
[1:28:48] the son does not have to worry
[1:28:50] it's already done he can step on the
[1:28:53] scene and say thou said the lord it's
[1:28:55] going to happen
[1:28:58] [Applause]
[1:29:02] because he's working on the father's
[1:29:05] time
[1:29:08] for for the resurrection of lazarus it
[1:29:10] was on the father's time
[1:29:15] praise the lord
[1:29:17] three days four days was no time to god
[1:29:20] because one day to god is a thousand
[1:29:22] years
[1:29:29] our fallen nature
[1:29:31] have the tendency
[1:29:33] of making us impatient
[1:29:37] impatient
[1:29:38] church has turned to casino people want
[1:29:40] to put a dime and cash in the million
[1:29:47] amen
[1:29:49] praise the lord
[1:29:54] and we take we take god out of the
[1:29:56] picture
[1:30:00] nor trust in god
[1:30:06] are we together
[1:30:09] i see the cloud like a man's hand
[1:30:13] and i know it is going to rain
[1:30:18] praise the lord
[1:30:24] are we together
[1:30:28] there is there is this there is this
[1:30:30] principle
[1:30:32] there is just principle over in
[1:30:34] deuteronomy chapter 32
[1:30:37] verse 30.
[1:30:39] let's let's uh
[1:30:41] okay i have it right open here
[1:30:47] how she won't chase a thousand in two
[1:30:49] port
[1:30:51] ten thousand
[1:30:53] to flight
[1:30:55] amen
[1:31:04] after we left
[1:31:05] ben house yesterday everybody's stomach
[1:31:07] fault
[1:31:11] the food digesting the blood start
[1:31:13] running in my head
[1:31:16] feeling like i want to sleep
[1:31:20] i drove over to the church here
[1:31:23] and then uh
[1:31:24] just asking god for mercy lord please
[1:31:27] have mercy on me i eat too much oh don't
[1:31:30] help me
[1:31:34] what would i say to your people master
[1:31:35] my phone
[1:31:39] but the lord was gracious amen
[1:31:43] he was gracious
[1:31:45] he was gracious
[1:31:48] amen we had a wonderful time
[1:31:51] looking into the word of the lord
[1:31:54] and uh yeah yeah so
[1:31:56] i got home a little bit late this
[1:31:58] morning but we thank the lord for that
[1:32:00] so when you look at this principle i was
[1:32:03] looking at this principle a little bit
[1:32:04] last night
[1:32:06] and it is known that
[1:32:09] uh
[1:32:11] a drafthurst
[1:32:14] in its own
[1:32:16] it can pull up to 8 000 pounds
[1:32:24] praise the lord
[1:32:29] it's almost like pulling a summer truck
[1:32:31] you know a lot of these big trucks
[1:32:33] and he says however when two draft
[1:32:36] horses work together
[1:32:39] they can move up to 24 000
[1:32:46] pounds
[1:32:48] and then if they are trained
[1:32:51] to work together they can move up to 32.
[1:32:58] it's a lord
[1:32:59] that is in nature
[1:33:01] it's an unwritten lord
[1:33:05] it's an unwritten lord
[1:33:07] you don't have to go to bible school to
[1:33:09] learn it that's right
[1:33:11] you don't have to you know finish master
[1:33:13] degree to it's unwritten law
[1:33:17] if two can agree on anything
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:25] it's honorating lord
[1:33:30] praise the lord
[1:33:34] now so
[1:33:36] with with this thought in mind
[1:33:40] it takes us back to illusion lamentation
[1:33:43] what was he crying about
[1:33:46] because he realized
[1:33:49] how the ministry of elijah was pulling
[1:33:53] israel out of idolatry amen
[1:34:00] the ministry of elijah
[1:34:02] was the powerhouse
[1:34:08] it was pulling
[1:34:11] in another world he was saying oh my
[1:34:13] father you are the terror of israel
[1:34:17] if we have a horseman it's not a hot
[1:34:19] terrace it's not ahab ahmed you are the
[1:34:22] army of is
[1:34:24] because just by a vision
[1:34:27] he sat in his house and gave instruction
[1:34:30] to the army of israel
[1:34:32] how to fight their battles
[1:34:35] and the king said it looks like there is
[1:34:37] somebody here
[1:34:39] that is on reconnaissance
[1:34:41] somebody is telling somebody say no no
[1:34:43] king no
[1:34:44] that's a prophet
[1:34:46] he sits in his bare chamber
[1:34:49] and he knows what is happening
[1:34:52] amen
[1:34:55] amen
[1:34:58] god praise the lord
[1:35:01] lord israel age
[1:35:03] has make
[1:35:05] a mess out of the ministry
[1:35:07] we have a whole lot of uh uh untrained
[1:35:11] people and prosperity gospel and and and
[1:35:14] it's almost like jacob coming down to
[1:35:17] egypt
[1:35:20] that joseph had to tell the lie
[1:35:22] because shepherds are abomination
[1:35:25] to the egyptians
[1:35:27] and that's how this age is
[1:35:30] as now you say i'm a preacher they say
[1:35:31] oh one of them
[1:35:33] all of those money scandals and money
[1:35:36] everything that money that they're all
[1:35:38] in people's minds
[1:35:44] and that mentality is one of is the same
[1:35:47] thing that is destroying the family
[1:35:50] structure
[1:35:53] because the same position
[1:35:55] of the president to the nation
[1:35:58] is the same position of a pastor to his
[1:36:01] church
[1:36:02] the same position of a prophet to a
[1:36:05] generation the same position of a man to
[1:36:08] his home
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:12] amen
[1:36:19] politicians are just liars they are just
[1:36:21] crook
[1:36:22] and we say all of that and we and we say
[1:36:24] there are things that are happening we
[1:36:26] can't say that they are not happening
[1:36:27] but it is a god instituted
[1:36:31] ordained place
[1:36:33] and we must respect the man that is
[1:36:35] there
[1:36:41] that's the thing that is destroying
[1:36:44] the very core of the society
[1:36:49] what is destroying is that it's
[1:36:51] destroying our trust and confidence in
[1:36:54] leadership
[1:36:57] that's what is destroyed
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:03] we don't have no respect for leaders
[1:37:05] whether it is the boss our job whether
[1:37:07] that wouldn't there just no respect for
[1:37:10] leaders
[1:37:13] i just i don't i just here to make my
[1:37:15] money i'm not here for anybody
[1:37:27] and we think in that way
[1:37:32] we are appealing to god's
[1:37:34] mercy
[1:37:36] no
[1:37:38] that's the thing that is making
[1:37:40] everything around us is falling
[1:37:43] everything around us is crumbling
[1:37:47] even the world are supposed to lead us
[1:37:49] we don't even have respect to the world
[1:38:00] the center is destroyed nothing can hold
[1:38:06] nothing can hold
[1:38:07] so elasher lamentation
[1:38:10] when he cried and tore his clothes
[1:38:13] oh my father
[1:38:15] right
[1:38:17] you are the powerhouse of israel
[1:38:23] because the sin of jeroboam was eating
[1:38:25] the people
[1:38:48] praise the lord
[1:38:53] you know this age is just like
[1:38:56] richard
[1:39:00] when rachel left her father house
[1:39:04] she stole her father idol
[1:39:09] praise the lord
[1:39:10] and that's how we live the nomination
[1:39:12] and and we see the other
[1:39:14] their way of doing things
[1:39:16] we come with our denominational mind our
[1:39:18] denomination of uh secret things

[1:39:35] should work for us
[1:39:37] we have higher god

[1:40:11] that
[1:40:15] elijah
[1:40:17] was not just crying out of sympathy
[1:40:21] or crying because he needed a double
[1:40:24] potion
[1:40:29] but he was crying because
[1:40:32] he have understood and knew what the
[1:40:35] ministry of elijah was
[1:40:39] not only to him but to the hold of
[1:40:41] israel
[1:40:42] that this man is the powerhouse
[1:40:46] this man is the force that was carrying
[1:40:47] the nation
[1:40:51] and that's the scene where the bride
[1:40:52] stands on the earth
[1:40:58] she's the one that is keeping the wrath
[1:40:59] of god
[1:41:06] she's the moon that is controlling the

[1:48:11] we will learn from the scripture
[1:48:14] that
[1:48:15] this age also has
[1:48:19] uh a press on it
[1:48:21] in revelation chapters chapter 6 and uh
[1:48:25] wednesday night we were talking about
[1:48:27] the four living creatures the full
[1:48:29] powered around the throne revelation
[1:48:31] chapter 6 also identified
[1:48:34] four beasts
[1:48:37] amen
[1:48:40] there's
[1:48:41] the the the the
[1:48:44] the white house
[1:48:47] amen
[1:48:48] the red
[1:48:50] the black
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:54] but i want you to notice go back read
[1:48:56] your scripture
[1:48:57] notice that
[1:48:59] in all of those beats their name was
[1:49:02] never mentioned
[1:49:05] the name of the rather was never
[1:49:07] mentioned
[1:49:09] until the last beast
[1:49:15] until the last beast which is the pill
[1:49:18] house
[1:49:20] which of course now
[1:49:22] it was the combining
[1:49:24] of all of those power
[1:49:28] religious
[1:49:30] political
[1:49:31] demonic power
[1:49:35] was all brought together now in the pill
[1:49:38] house and the bible says his name is
[1:49:42] called death
[1:49:44] with hell
[1:49:45] he has such a power to pull hell on the
[1:49:48] people
[1:49:53] when the prophet of god said the land is
[1:49:54] taken out of hell
[1:49:56] there are forces that is pulling hair on
[1:49:58] the people
[1:50:11] destruction and i mean and things things
[1:50:14] i mean uh
[1:50:15] such such an age
[1:50:18] you know and that is the reason why we
[1:50:21] have to be thankful to god
[1:50:23] we have to be grateful to god that in
[1:50:26] the midst of everything we can still
[1:50:27] pick up our bible to read we can say
[1:50:30] come to church we must be thankful to
[1:50:32] god
[1:50:35] amen
[1:50:36] if you think that you will get
[1:50:38] everything right before you start
[1:50:39] serving god
[1:50:42] praise the lord
[1:50:48] but bram says i should not even wish
[1:50:50] hell to my to my worst enemy so
[1:50:52] i won't say that to you
[1:50:55] praise the lord
[1:50:57] but you can see it
[1:50:59] you can see the the
[1:51:01] the press that is on us
[1:51:06] why we have all of these struggles
[1:51:09] in our homes
[1:51:13] praise the lord
[1:51:16] the devil was never married before
[1:51:18] so marriage is not his interest
[1:51:22] praise the lord
[1:51:25] amen
[1:51:27] right from eden he's just been kind of
[1:51:30] messing around with with people's wife
[1:51:42] and all of those things are out there
[1:51:47] and you see that when when when when all
[1:51:50] of these little arguments and faucets
[1:51:52] and things
[1:51:54] hero makes us to see that he's the one
[1:51:56] doing it
[1:52:00] he says is the brother this is the
[1:52:02] sister
[1:52:03] is this person and as long as he can
[1:52:05] leave us like that and just get fussy
[1:52:07] just go on and look for something else
[1:52:09] to do
[1:52:11] see how much he can put the pressure on
[1:52:13] us so he can have a one-month vacation
[1:52:20] and let and leave us walking at our
[1:52:22] thoughts and arguing and blaming one
[1:52:24] another
[1:52:28] looking for every thought in the
[1:52:29] preacher looking for every thought in
[1:52:30] the church and looking for every thought
[1:52:32] everything that is not going right amen
[1:52:36] i just gave him time to go for vacation
[1:52:41] he's a businessman even a vacation he's
[1:52:44] he's catching out
[1:52:46] he's investing he's looking for
[1:52:47] something to do
[1:52:48] praise the lord
[1:52:54] so we see this we see this
[1:52:57] now bring it to the time of israel
[1:53:00] there was the sin of jeroboam
[1:53:04] what jeroboam did
[1:53:07] he established idols
[1:53:09] in three cities of israel
[1:53:13] a good symbol of the trinity
[1:53:18] and he told the people he said yellow
[1:53:20] israel
[1:53:22] this is your god that brought you
[1:53:25] why should you spend time and go all the
[1:53:27] way to jerusalem to the temple of
[1:53:28] solomon to worship
[1:53:31] and slowly
[1:53:32] that thing started eating the people up
[1:53:37] they gave every reason not to go to
[1:53:39] jerusalem they can just go right there
[1:53:41] and worship and start start eating the
[1:53:43] people up
[1:53:44] amen
[1:53:47] people start getting themselves involved
[1:53:49] in idolatry
[1:53:52] and it became such a sin such a power
[1:53:55] that even the king of israel ahab
[1:53:59] was pooled to go and marry
[1:54:02] an adult worshiper's daughter
[1:54:05] that was where the church and idolatry
[1:54:08] marry
[1:54:10] which means idolatry now was on the
[1:54:12] throne
[1:54:13] amen idolatry was on the throne
[1:54:17] that's the reason why if you don't
[1:54:18] balance yourself in the word of god you
[1:54:20] can still be in this message and you'll
[1:54:22] be worshiping idols
[1:54:24] you will make brother branham your idol
[1:54:26] you will make your pastor your adam you
[1:54:28] will make your church your idol
[1:54:40] because idolatry got married
[1:54:46] and then it's on the throne
[1:54:49] it's on the throne it's now
[1:54:52] ruling the people
[1:54:55] they have come crying
[1:54:57] he won't never van yeah jessica said why
[1:54:59] are you crying are you not a king
[1:55:03] i don't like no weak man
[1:55:06] you are weakling
[1:55:09] come crying why are you crying for
[1:55:11] are you not a king
[1:55:13] if you are the king everything of this
[1:55:14] land belongs to you
[1:55:19] a neighbor was killed
[1:55:21] on his father's inheritance
[1:55:27] and it was engineered
[1:55:29] by the woman
[1:55:30] that was on the throne
[1:55:35] amen
[1:55:37] are we together
[1:55:41] so you see it was such out of place
[1:55:43] there was there was such an evil power
[1:55:46] evil pressing adultery that was now
[1:55:49] moving capturing israel
[1:55:53] capturing israel
[1:55:56] if you read the book of chronicles you
[1:55:58] will learn that
[1:55:59] all the priests and the people that
[1:56:01] could not support
[1:56:04] that idolatry they move towards judah
[1:56:08] now that is that is where you know
[1:56:11] theologian gets mixed up anything that's
[1:56:13] a missing trap of israel no
[1:56:18] no
[1:56:19] it was because if you were a priest and
[1:56:22] you were not subscribed to build worship
[1:56:25] you will be killed
[1:56:27] so those priests that wanted to stay
[1:56:30] under the worship of the world they
[1:56:32] would sneak out and they moved to judah
[1:56:35] amen the people that were in judah and
[1:56:37] they got tired with their pastor
[1:56:40] they got tired when they passed away
[1:56:42] with this thing here they
[1:56:43] they will slip out
[1:56:46] and move over
[1:56:48] to the northern kingdom
[1:56:53] praise the lord
[1:56:57] and this idolatry was just was just
[1:56:59] eating the people consuming the people
[1:57:02] that's the reason why god had to send a
[1:57:05] ministry like the minister of elijah
[1:57:08] a man that bounced on the scene we don't
[1:57:10] know where he came from
[1:57:12] nothing about his mother nothing about
[1:57:14] his father
[1:57:15] we don't know about his upbringing but
[1:57:17] he just has such a message go straight
[1:57:20] to the king and say you are the one
[1:57:23] you are the one
[1:57:25] that is troubling israel
[1:57:29] a fearless man
[1:57:32] praise the lord
[1:57:35] because he knew oh heaven was behind him
[1:57:39] praise the lord
[1:57:40] all heaven was back in the word
[1:57:44] when god sent a gosm messenger that is
[1:57:49] the powerhouse of god for that age
[1:57:56] paul was the powerhouse of his age
[1:57:59] that's the reason why he could stand and
[1:58:01] say god will judge the word according to
[1:58:04] my gospel
[1:58:07] he could see it like that because he
[1:58:09] knew where he was standing with god he
[1:58:11] knew he was the powerhouse
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:20] praise the lord
[1:58:22] oh my god
[1:58:29] a good old-fashioned holy ghost sent
[1:58:31] revival man back to believe in the word
[1:58:33] of god
[1:58:34] that god will take care of us
[1:58:38] like he did
[1:58:40] in the old days
[1:58:41] he still take years
[1:58:44] praise the lord
[1:58:46] he still take care of us
[1:58:49] if alarm clock could wake people up we
[1:58:52] should send it to the graveyard
[1:58:58] or send it to the mark
[1:59:06] praise the lord
[1:59:09] if god don't wake you up you won't hear
[1:59:10] that alarm clock ranking
[1:59:15] so god still take years like he did in
[1:59:17] days of all he would take care of us
[1:59:19] today do you believe that god will take
[1:59:21] care of us what we need today
[1:59:25] is another refilling
[1:59:29] amen
[1:59:30] another like the disciples i love this
[1:59:32] he says some of you trying
[1:59:35] to test an experience
[1:59:38] or trust it
[1:59:41] that they had 10 years ago that's all
[1:59:44] right but what about today
[1:59:47] amen
[1:59:48] that ten years ago two years ago must be
[1:59:51] the same today because he's the same
[1:59:53] yesterday today and forever
[1:59:57] he's not the hours he's the i am
[2:00:01] yes
[2:00:03] that's all right but what's about today
[2:00:05] we need one today today is the day show
[2:00:10] a feeling
[2:00:12] the disciples about three or four days
[2:00:15] after
[2:00:16] they received the holy ghost
[2:00:18] they went back
[2:00:20] and got
[2:00:21] in one call
[2:00:24] and they began to pray again
[2:00:26] with one accord until the holy ghost
[2:00:29] shook the building
[2:00:31] as chapter two as chapter four
[2:00:36] amen praise the lord
[2:00:41] you just don't lay it on one experience
[2:00:43] because it should carry you from
[2:00:45] experience to experience
[2:00:47] from one experience to another
[2:00:49] experience
[2:00:54] hallelujah
[2:00:56] until the holy ghost shook the building
[2:00:58] where they were
[2:00:59] he said one thing why cry one thing that
[2:01:02] the tabernacle needs
[2:01:05] of that at our church or we can say yeah
[2:01:08] good shepherd is the real dedication or
[2:01:11] a refilling of the holy ghost
[2:01:15] everyone get down at the altar
[2:01:17] and pray until
[2:01:19] they get a renewing
[2:01:22] of the holy ghost
[2:01:24] amen

[2:02:11] re-equivalence
[2:02:12] and then we can still re-era this
[2:02:14] morning
[2:02:15] what shall i do with jesus the dynamics
[2:02:18] of this church
[2:02:20] will be the refilling
[2:02:22] of the holy ghost
[2:02:24] you know the principle of the dynamics
[2:02:26] and the mechanics
[2:02:28] praise the lord
[2:02:29] this is like our all our you know
[2:02:32] nice vehicles all parked in the parking
[2:02:34] lot there
[2:02:36] if you don't have gasoline in it
[2:02:41] it's not going to spark
[2:02:44] whatever it is press button whether you
[2:02:46] talk to it
[2:02:49] or you turn the key or you push it down
[2:02:52] the hill
[2:02:53] if it does not have the sparking oil in
[2:02:56] it it will not
[2:02:59] amen spark

[2:03:10] it can be
[2:03:12] tesla it can be 2 2
[2:03:14] 20 23 vehicle
[2:03:17] the moment you have to push the car it's
[2:03:19] embarrassing
[2:03:23] your car's supposed to carry you
[2:03:27] well you have to stand on the road
[2:03:29] and start pushing
[2:03:34] praise a lot people don't look at the
[2:03:36] brand name again
[2:03:39] they don't look at the brand name they
[2:03:40] don't look at the behind say which car
[2:03:42] he pushing
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:55] the dynamics of this church will be the
[2:03:57] refilling of the holy ghost that we have
[2:04:00] worked in a small measure
[2:04:03] while the hair stone is coming down
[2:04:05] that's all what's happening all through
[2:04:07] the ages
[2:04:08] and that's the same thing that is
[2:04:10] happening with the fightful ministry we
[2:04:12] have these brothers comes and and every
[2:04:14] one of them preaching and then we get on
[2:04:16] fire we shout always a good service and
[2:04:18] then the next service wednesday now we
[2:04:20] come oh god
[2:04:22] peter glory crazy
[2:04:27] what's happening
[2:04:32] the son of servant is supposed to
[2:04:34] prepare us for wednesday service the
[2:04:36] blessing of the son itself servants
[2:04:37] supposed to bring us up and we clapping
[2:04:39] our hands and we and we're thanking god
[2:04:41] and we thank you and we praise him and
[2:04:43] then wednesday said we prepare for
[2:04:44] sunday morning we come back with praises
[2:04:46] again
[2:04:51] it looks like we have to push this wagon
[2:04:57] what it needs is the dynamic
[2:05:00] it needs the dynamic
[2:05:02] the holy ghost to make this thing real
[2:05:04] to you that we are not making church
[2:05:07] we are having church
[2:05:09] there's a difference between making
[2:05:11] church and having church we are having
[2:05:13] church we are rejoicing in the promises
[2:05:16] that has been given to us
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:30] praise the lord
[2:05:32] oh my
[2:05:34] my father my father
[2:05:36] the chariot of israel
[2:05:39] the chariot of israel
[2:05:42] and the husband thereof
[2:05:44] that's why elijah was saying you are the
[2:05:47] one
[2:05:51] he tore his clothes because he
[2:05:53] identified the anointing he identified
[2:05:56] the responsibility
[2:05:58] that goes with the ministry
[2:06:03] it's not copy and paste people
[2:06:10] he saw it
[2:06:16] oh my father yes amen
[2:06:24] that's the reason why god
[2:06:26] have to give him a double potion
[2:06:30] a double portion
[2:06:32] because he knew what he was facing
[2:06:35] he knew the spirit of idolatry
[2:06:38] now an elijah is not around
[2:06:41] praise the
[2:06:42] lord he's going to deal with those same
[2:06:45] spirits
[2:06:48] that elijah was dealing with
[2:06:51] praise the lord
[2:06:53] amen
[2:06:55] you know when you get to that place
[2:06:56] where where the scripture says
[2:06:59] you know the woman was now sub-authority
[2:07:01] i spoke a little bit of that on
[2:07:02] wednesday night
[2:07:03] you realize that people don't understand
[2:07:05] that they just think that it's a kind of
[2:07:07] obsessive thing you know that they will
[2:07:09] always have an
[2:07:10] interpretation for rape but you see god
[2:07:13] back his word
[2:07:16] he back his word
[2:07:18] why because when uh uh uh uh uh
[2:07:22] other original creation adam and eve
[2:07:25] they were co-equal
[2:07:28] praise the lord
[2:07:29] amen they were called equal
[2:07:34] and and and the enemy comes to eve
[2:07:40] he twists the word
[2:07:42] and got her reasoning with him
[2:07:44] yes
[2:07:45] when god says thou shalt surely die
[2:07:49] he makes a sound thou shalt naturally
[2:07:52] dare
[2:07:53] three letter words he dropped right in
[2:07:54] there
[2:07:58] rob her of the power that she had
[2:08:05] praise the lord
[2:08:11] amen
[2:08:12] now so you see
[2:08:15] uh
[2:08:16] because just like i have said over and
[2:08:18] over
[2:08:20] when god made a woman genesis 2 7 uh uh
[2:08:23] uh in genesis 2 when when when god took
[2:08:26] you know out of the red the bible says
[2:08:28] he you know i put adam to a deep slave
[2:08:31] and what happened is that uh we learned
[2:08:35] he he gives the woman three sacred value
[2:08:40] now almighty god
[2:08:42] with his own knowledge
[2:08:45] before they now happen as a surprise to
[2:08:48] god
[2:08:50] we should know better than that
[2:08:52] amen
[2:08:54] we should know better than people says
[2:08:55] but why the god may uh uh adam to sin
[2:09:00] why the god made it you have never known
[2:09:03] god to be a healer
[2:09:04] you have never known him to be a
[2:09:06] deliverer
[2:09:08] praise the lord
[2:09:09] we know better than that
[2:09:12] amen and we must teach our children
[2:09:14] better than that
[2:09:15] praise the
[2:09:16] lord
[2:09:18] but then
[2:09:20] he placed these three sacrifices in the
[2:09:23] woman
[2:09:26] invisible union the prophet said is
[2:09:29] because
[2:09:30] of redemption
[2:09:34] so those three sacrifices will now serve
[2:09:38] as the woman's power
[2:09:43] her power is hidden behind her weakness
[2:09:51] praise the lord
[2:09:54] amen
[2:09:57] now so god will now instruct a man and
[2:10:01] place the man at that place of
[2:10:03] leadership so he's in the head he's in
[2:10:06] the front but he has this woman behind
[2:10:09] him
[2:10:11] amen
[2:10:15] that has three sacrifices
[2:10:20] she has a threefold purpose in her
[2:10:26] that's her power the prophet of god says
[2:10:28] and a man he says any man will take out
[2:10:31] his heart
[2:10:33] every time one of those virtues is
[2:10:35] rightly displayed
[2:10:42] it's a hating power
[2:10:50] she have it in her
[2:10:52] to give life
[2:10:55] to be a mother
[2:10:56] she's the mother of all living she makes
[2:11:00] a dead home to live
[2:11:06] it's in her
[2:11:07] it's in her
[2:11:13] praise the lord
[2:11:16] so you see the power uh the way that god
[2:11:20] distributed it
[2:11:22] he is it's not like he he robbed the
[2:11:24] woman
[2:11:25] when people think that it should be just
[2:11:28] like the muslims do
[2:11:31] put all the men to the front and the
[2:11:32] women to the back
[2:11:35] they are caught unclean
[2:11:37] no
[2:11:38] that's not why we're running here
[2:11:41] that's not god's order
[2:11:51] it's not a teaching or a religion of men
[2:11:53] dominate woman no that's not why we're
[2:11:55] running we are putting everybody in
[2:11:57] their place
[2:12:00] say the man must be the man of his home
[2:12:03] he must take the word
[2:12:05] lead and instruct us home
[2:12:16] praise the lord
[2:12:24] the redeemer was not promised to adam
[2:12:27] it was not the seed of a man
[2:12:30] it was the seed of the woman
[2:12:33] that would bruise the serpent head
[2:12:37] praise the lord
[2:12:39] i can prove it through the scripture
[2:12:40] prove it through the word
[2:12:42] prove it through the message
[2:12:44] but ram says supreme mother can do more
[2:12:46] than a man in the pulpit
[2:12:52] it's a seal of the woman
[2:12:54] that bruises the serpent head if the
[2:12:56] woman can rightly find her place
[2:12:59] and rightly use though god gave him that
[2:13:02] to you
[2:13:17] no wonder we can have revival
[2:13:21] god can send gifts and everything else
[2:13:24] to set it and do miracles and perform
[2:13:26] things and people said no wonder
[2:13:29] they're seen in a camp
[2:13:32] we got to clean the clean that thing out
[2:13:36] and operate
[2:13:39] praise the lord
[2:13:42] we can never run a church with this
[2:13:45] earnest thing
[2:13:47] amen
[2:13:49] this earnest
[2:13:50] being suspicious of one another it's a
[2:13:52] mess you can't run a church like that
[2:13:54] you can never run at home like that
[2:14:01] we will now have a successful family if
[2:14:03] we are dishonest to one another
[2:14:13] you're trying to build a twins tower
[2:14:16] two separate tower that runs parallel
[2:14:21] not supposed to be a twin star with
[2:14:22] people
[2:14:31] we got to clean the thing out
[2:14:34] and operate that's exactly right and
[2:14:36] have the church straighten up and
[2:14:39] running right
[2:14:49] praise the lord
[2:14:52] have the church straightened up and
[2:14:53] running right
[2:14:54] half our lives stretching up and running
[2:14:56] right and then god will come in and go
[2:14:59] and doing signs and wonders among us
[2:15:03] just just simple principle
[2:15:06] just put things in their place the law
[2:15:08] of god will work
[2:15:11] i'm telling you a person does not have
[2:15:13] to be a message believer for this law to
[2:15:15] work it's an unwritten lord
[2:15:19] it's an unwritten lord
[2:15:23] praise the lord that's why sometimes we
[2:15:25] get confused well they're they're not
[2:15:27] they're not christians but they're
[2:15:29] having happy family it's all because
[2:15:31] they have broke into the law of god
[2:15:34] [Music]
[2:15:37] it's a law that is written in nature
[2:15:39] amen
[2:15:40] but we think now we are christian we get
[2:15:42] this bible
[2:15:45] praise the lord the bible that's
[2:15:47] supposed to help our we use it to fight
[2:15:52] when we're supposed to be reading it
[2:15:54] we're knocking one another with it
[2:15:56] but the bible says yeah the bible said
[2:15:57] too

[2:16:20] organization i can stand behind the
[2:16:21] prophet of god and say the same thing

[2:17:05] it's not to start a movement among the
[2:17:07] people but to build a son of god
[2:17:10] that when there is no church
[2:17:13] there is nobody living he will be a son
[2:17:16] of god
[2:17:18] he will be a son of god he will live to
[2:17:21] the truth conscious of his mind

[2:23:48] to ask your question
[2:23:52] if you want to to to understand better
[2:23:55] and walk in faith
[2:23:58] not a question because you want to prove
[2:23:59] a point

[2:24:06] nothing can harm her not even death
[2:24:10] for if the seed be planted
