========================================

[Music] do do [Music] with the old carnal church all the time because that's where he sold jesus to he sold jesus his birthrights just as much as esau did for a mess of pottage he sold his birthrights for 30 pieces of silver manny a man and woman today has sold out their spiritual birthright for some popularity some little thing of the world you never overcome some women are wearing a makeup and bobbing of hair wearing short clothes man for little dirty jokes and smoking cigarettes something of the world if you love the world the things of the world the lover god's not in you said the bible i don't want to hurt you but we're up to the end we're coming up now we're coming out the ladder quickly see how it is they do it they're predestinating they might impersonate and be just as sweet and humble just as close like christians so close that would deceive the very elect but by their fruit you shall know them a woman with a short son never looked like a christian to me the bible said it's a sinful and a shameful thing for a woman to cut her hair only one woman in the bible will ever paint their faces jezebel how about man you man is supposed to be christian man and let your wives do that when god will hold you responsible for not it carnival oh i'll go out there and join this church you think about that's just exactly what the scripture said they would do and that's just exactly what they done and that's what they will do compromise someone said billy if you don't stop that you'll run everybody away there's one thing that won't go the holy spirit because it's his word and the real predestinated believer won't go away because it's food to his soul he loves it nothing can keep him away from it he'll do anything like jacob but he wants that birthright you're standing i don't care if it cost every friend he's got it cost his job if it costs his church membership if it costs everything he'll still hold to it because he can't help it there's something in him moving him the deep calling to the demon oh something in him look anything you want to find in the bible and pick it up here go back to genesis and see what hatched out of see word come to all the spirits and moves today go back to genesis that's what we've done to prove to you these things that you're seeing friends don't forget that don't let it go over top of your head let it soak into you that's the things of god it come to a head and jesus predicted it would come to a head again in the last days and it would be by this the seal of god and the mark of the beast two spiritual powers working together now anyone knows that the seal of god is the birthright the baptism of the holy ghost ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed to the day of your redemption when they were born again they were filled with the holy spirit the holy spirit is the new birth we know that you're you're begotten of the spirit i'll admit that but until you're born there's a baby's begotten in his mother's womb it's got one kind of life that's a life that's little the little uh cells in his body is twisting and kicking and jumping like that but when it's bomber it has a like that and then he squeals it out a living soul and a baby can go to church and say well i believe in church i'll go i'll do this and i'm a good i want to do right i want to do right but what it needs is a gospel spank to wake it up to squeal the eternal life the holy spirit screams in it i could never scream before and it's a new creature it's warned of the spirit then begins to grow move and have its being in god see just as a baby natural baby has his being in the world then if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting this is sure as the natural body was coming forth there was a spiritual body to receive it when it dropped from its mother and when it drops from the mother earth which is it's in the womb of it now groaning crying oh god groaning laboring getting old and sickness and everything resetting it and a spirit on the inside of it looking for a land beyond the river it's groaning twisting jumping as because there's a life in there that lives forever it's in a body that's got to die and sometimes this is a mother dropped the natural baby in a spiritual body got it the earth will drop in the body of the natural drop and the physical body or the celestial body will grab it down here if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting that's reason you forget the things of the world they're dead to you there's the spirit now watch it as we move on now the two spirits the holy ghost is the new birth we know that it's being born again of the spirit of god that's how you're born by the spirit born by the spirit that's the new birth all right you're begotten of the spirit then when you're born to the spirit you're filled with the holy ghost all right then when these two are in the earth the natural and the spiritual uh sometimes the i've seen this now i'm closing out to come to a close now by saying this for a few minutes in the natural are in the spiritual either one now i hope that everyone catches this now be just as quiet and reverent as you can now have you ever seen this you see in our churches today even in the groups where we have separated ourselves and made organizations and we've seen all of this and you've seen a man pick up a certain scripture and brother that man can take that scripture and make it live new make it live just exactly what a promise you're in the bible and the next man will see him do it and he'll come around and try to do it and fail i hope you're reading now he'll fail why the scripture is not inspired to him he's only trying to impersonate he's trying to act like something he wants maybe he was sent by man maybe some man said well you can do the same thing just like jesus said it would be this way the bible predicts it in the last days as jefferson james wish to moses yeah amen there stood moses and there's two jambs and moses threw down his rod and become a serpent why pharaoh said come here james you can do the same thing and he did see but what happened then moses rod eat up the rod of him see it was made manifest where was israel just like super sentient perception it's like some of the spiritualism it's like some of these churches that they believe carnal way away the things that they say well that was for another day they're all together out but watch this spirit in the last days go to impersonate the real spirit see that's where your trouble is coming just exactly like the one that's real but he couldn't make it manifest he couldn't make it whole he couldn't make it last oh god people come up and say i got the holy ghost too look where they live and don't last from one revival to another from one meeting to another it's made manifest they haven't got it if a man's born to the spirit of god or a woman they have the fruit of the spirit they walk godly they live that life they keep away from the things of the world god moves in them and makes himself manifest and proves that he's god working in there the other is impersonating impersonations that's what's been all the way down impersonating look at ishmael and isaac all down see impersonating look at the prophet moses and look at the prophet balaam see see how they come down look at judas and look at jesus and jesus predicts that this holy spirit in the last days would be the seal of god now what would be the mark of the beast would be to reject the seal of god for all that didn't have the seal of god had the mark of the beast and if it's two spiritual marks one of them will be a true mark of god the other will be apostasy can you see it look at the mark in the old testament when the trumpet blow the jubilee every so many years the the slaves went free because the trumpet sounded well everyone that wanted to be free could go but some of them they love to be slaves so they tuck them to the altar and in the post of the church and bored their ear with an awl and they were marked forever they always serve that master and today you'll hear a gospel message on truth now you can be free if you want to god speaks to you but when you get up to that borderline here and look over and have a knowledge driven man turn away he bores you in the ear and you'll always be an intellectual believer you'll be religious and go to church but never receive the holy ghost then you serve that the rest your days now the mark of the beast are the seal of god and we're getting so close now look the word has to be inspired hearing recognizing and acting upon many people are here but won't recognize it god will say this is the hour for you i wouldn't be a holy rover and i don't want none of that see they don't recognize it we'll go to meetings the great holy spirit will move down i was sitting there the other day when a vision came forth and predicted just exactly what i said here comes a young man come here motion to that waiter you have heart trouble and you're looking for it it's exactly right yeah woman coming out come here you've got tumor on the breast now it's on the left breast and you're in a very bad shape in your center and exactly right those men sat there looking around preachers and all that huh go to a meeting and watch the holy spirit go right out through the meeting and tell the secrets of the hearts thing like i say wonderful yes oh brother see it's it's on the other side there's something happening women will continue to go right on do the same thing man will go right on back like a hog to its water and a dog to its vomit just the same don't you see i'm talking to the in the you see you must realize and friend what condition you're in that's reason this tape i said to church only the church only if you've been called from life from darkness unto life from death unto life from a formal intellection conception of christ to a born-again experience and watching your life that it lays the things of the world aside you stand for christ regardless and something's happening there's something in you hungering and moving like it was jacob you wrestle with the lord you walk different after that something's different and you've changed now it has before it can be done it has to be inspired to you i don't care i could stand here and preach till i got what hair got left fell out until my shoulder stooped down and i was 90 years old and you listen every day until god quickens that to you am i you're still in the same shape two days i've been studying and praying on this i said lord should i say that to the church someone said say it the hour's at hand i feel it be pulling me away pretty soon so i i want you to know it no man can come to me said jesus except my father draws him first oh i know you say you have god and abraham to your father but i'll tell you this you're the your father the devil said jesus religious man priest and great man you are the devil your father notice the fruits of the spirit now see it has to be quickened to you i couldn't imagine noah saying you know what it just must be it might rain someday so i'll just go out and build me an arc if it rains well i'll get in the heart and move right away and nothing will bother me because i'm going to get the ark and move away could you imagine no no that wasn't it if that had been it oh may the elect to hear it now if that would have been it the first scoffer come by as the bible said there was scoffed at him he'd laid his hammer down and walked away like man does today that starts out with jesus and when they look over and see the truth they back away from it they can't stand it like that noted evangelist said it'll tear up my ministry i don't care for a ministry that the holy ghost would tear up it ought to be torah now let's see it's pride so much man so much person notice in this now noah was out in the field and he heard and he recognized and he acted no matter how many scoffers come he built right no away a holy roller don't bother me a bit feeling away he had heard he had recognized it to be god judged by the scriptures and it was so he built right away on the ark regardless could you imagine could you ever uh imagine this that moses is on his way to egypt out one day and said to zephyr his wife zephyr you know what i've polished up some on my grammar i have got a little my mathematics all straightened up and some of my gerometer you know many other things in my education since i've been heard and sheep back here i i've polished up on some of that i made a mistake down and he said i think i'll go down and correct it i think it'll go down no the first wave come against him he'd have fell right there what did he do he forgot all he ever known about dramating about uh he's intellectual it was the one got him in trouble that's what's got the church in trouble today is too many educated preachers without being born of the spirit many women like to listen to intellectual speeches instead of preaching the power and the resurrection of jesus christ that's what's got us in trouble today we don't need any more high schools in education for preachers we need god call man that's still with the holy spirit and not some man-made theology of some denomination the god-called man moses was hurting sheep settle down and forgot he noticed intellectuals had failed he noticed education failing he's hurting sheep but he heard oh take off your shoes moses the ground you're standing on is holy he listened to it what was it the voice the angel it spoke was scriptural he promised abraham his father i'll visit the people after they have been down here for 400 years and i'll take them out with a mighty arm you recognize that that was god's scripture being made manifest let me stop a minute let this sink in can you see what i'm talking about today god's words being made manifest right before you and you don't realize it i think now sodom and gomorrah think of the promise of christ for the last days moses recognized it it was scriptural it was a promise he heard he recognized something come in him brother he could go do it then he acted he could go down and stop ever pharaoh he could call flags when he wanted to he could open a red sea because he had heard he'd recognized he was acting in god's spirit i'll be god to you you'd be prophet to me he said and he said i can't do it he said well then you be god and let aaron be your prophet you must go anyhow he never just said well maybe i'll go down and straighten the things up could you imagine elijah on mount carmel said you know this land's awful sinful perhaps maybe i are to go out and tell a heavy arc be ashamed of these things maybe i were to go up on the mountain there and stay down and just fast so long until then people get so sick and tired to see me up there starving to death no no that wasn't it heard he recognized and he acted i have commanded the ravens to feed you get up there but cedric when it come time for a showdown between baal and god he said go get your sacrifices do anything to him you want to call upon your god when they cut themselves and had a lot of flesh and jumped up and down had a lot of noise he said holler a little louder maybe he's gone pursuing some more he might be asleep oh brother well you know what he said i'm a believer in jehovah so i can do this anyhow oh no don't you impersonate that no why don't you try to be elijah until god calls you to be necessary i'm a servant of jehovah there's 700 of them down there too but none of them dared to do it then when he cut the block and poured the water on he said lord i've done this at your command see though anybody else would have tried it we've been a total failure it's got to be inspired to you the holy spirit has to bring it and make it manifest to you that's what's the matter today you can't go up the altar and say well hallelujah hallelujah lord i want the holy ghost hallelujah hallelujah no but brother sister one of the holy ghost is inspired that word to you you'll get it before you leave your seat something in you burn up preacher won't have to tell you do this and do that the old leaves will just pop off a new lease oh come on it's inspired to you you won't get angry with the preacher when he preaches truth from the bible you'll love it reach for it it's food to your soul even jesus himself he said i do not what i want to do within myself the son can do nothing but what he sees the father doing the words he was emmanuel himself he was god on earth jesus was he was the flesh that god dwelt and he was a tent that god lived under amen but in all of that the virgin born son of god emmanuel in the fullness of the spirit he had the spirit without measure amen and yet in his own flesh he said i'll do nothing until the father shows me first inspired dream to do it satan said turn these stones into bread and perform a miracle let me see you do it he said it's written man shall i live by bread alone oh my god but when a crab was hungry he picked up five biscuits and two little fish and fed five thousand oh hallelujah you see what i mean don't try to impersonate that's what's the matter with pentecost today what's the matter with the church today there's too many trying to impersonate they got the holy ghost there's too many trying to impersonate divine healing there's too many trying to impersonate different things of the lord you can't do that that things comes by election god calling your god from the mother's womb gifts and callings are without repentance oh my that's true you can't make yourself something you're not but if god calls you'd be the most thankful person in the world because he has called you then it becomes real to you i would speak if i had time on the squirrels the other day i turned me around i've never seen it before and i couldn't do it hattie sitting back there looking at me how could that ever happen it couldn't have done it but it was inspired quickened the word was spoken it was made so hallelujah amen paul could you imagine saying i've been out on his seat for 14 days nice and no stars and moon or the sun or nothing guess i just grew up telling be a good courage because god take care of us anyhow oh god don't work like that god doesn't do that your faith's all right brother your faith is wonderful but until the things inspired to you here's a red light hanging there and if i see i said well i've got my foot on the accelerator i've got a car and go through that light and i'm making 120 miles an hour that's true i can feel the power under my foot but you better wait for the gold sign hallelujah [Music] the gold sign comes on all right when the thing's inspired to you and god makes it known like he did back there all right but until he does it we've got a bunch of juditarians impersonating walking along i said well i'm just the same as they are i'm a christian too oh don't you remember the signs of cephas see this yeah went out and said we journey jew you in the name of jesus paul preaches come on he said paul i know jesus i know but who are you the hour is coming when right and wrongs made manifest it shows in the christians today it shows in the churches today it shows in the peoples today i'm holding it along i want this to get to you paul never said i'll leave out his squad and say well be of a good courage no what did he do he heard an angel he know that the same angel always spoke to him he recognized then he acted one of them said be of a good courage for the angel of the lord whose servant i am stood by me last night showing me a vision that there'll be nothing lost on this ship be looking courage go eat your dinner now everything's all right amen when it's inspired to you when god makes it right i got a remark here somewhere i had to roll down here it is right here we're at the end of all things let me just bring this in like this now in closing i hope that god has revealed something to you everything's at the end someone asked the other night i believe his brother fred stockman we were asking about the how close the end time brother demon secarion had seen that vision so manifested and come to pass five days later to the perfect it was like dropped him out of his shoes he called me he said how is joseph i said all right so does he see visions i said yep he told me if david's brother was his son before he'd fall on a motorcycle three or four days before it happened just exactly he said you know those things follow families i said righteous our evil does either one and follow his family and we were talking a little bit and fred said to me where is this drawn from brother branham i said look fred let's take it by nature god works in his nature look watch what happened the sun rose in the east that's the oldest civilization we have is china we all know that the oldest civilization we have is china all right and civilizations move westward all along and now where would you leave if you left the west coast going straight across go to china exactly we're at the end the bible said the prophet said there will be a day when it won't be night or day when the suns are passing or but in the evening time just before it ends up over here again it'll be light the same jesus said there will be a former rain and a laddering and the lattering will produce both former and latereen in the same sin we're at the end time look here let me show you politics is that the end do you believe that show me something today this nation is the worst in the world for corruption ungodliness who read their courier journal paper the other night in louisville when all these women pricking out each nation the prettiest woman in the nation sent them up to be miss the universe everyone did but russia and they sent the khrushchev and asked him why not he said russia don't strip their women down to walk before men he's an ungodly nation bringing reproach upon we who call ourselves christians said russia don't strip their women to walk out like i didn't you never see sharks or such tough as that in russia that's the ungodly we who call ourselves christians no word of the bible said ever tables become full of vomit and who cannot teach doctrine and who's we from the breast but precip will come upon precip and line up online or stamina lips and other tongues while i speak to this people and this is the rest for all this they were not here we got our own intellectual conception oh how good could be to stay all day on it politics corrupted democrats republicans and all is low down what is it it's a bunch of graft every person works in it it's not born again is of the devil the devil said every kingdom in the world belongs to me and jesus never debated with him the world is controlled by the devil whenever man it works for the government if he ain't a christian he's of the devil and working for the devil these nations will all fall to jesus christ when he comes there will be a millennium looking here today what they're going on [Music] you
