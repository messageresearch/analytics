[31:24] let's just turn to our Bibles tonight or
[31:27] before we do that let's just bring you
[31:30] some announcement for the weekend and
[31:33] [Music]
[31:36] first I will begin with reminding us
[31:41] that the Easter meeting were cancer and
[31:44] we all know why but we want to thank the
[31:48] Lord I spoke with brother Farris farmer
[31:51] on Monday morning or money afternoon
[31:55] actually I was trying to wait and
[31:58] listening to the to the governor press
[32:01] conference and then I call him later in
[32:04] the afternoon to let him know that what
[32:08] I told him I mind that since we didn't
[32:10] had an Easter meeting and if we could
[32:13] just push the meetings over to Memorial
[32:16] weekend and hoping that this cloud is
[32:21] going to pass and we can all be in
[32:25] church so we will keep that on keep
[32:30] there before the Lord in prayer so I
[32:32] asked perforce if he was if he would say
[32:36] be open and we could just all shift our
[32:39] date towards the Memorial weekend praise
[32:42] the Lord
[32:43] and naturally I was I was kind of
[32:46] looking at the you know the the calendar
[32:50] and it almost fare on Pentecost because
[32:53] right after Easter 50 days you know a
[32:57] Pentecost comes so but the 50 a weekend
[33:01] they would be the weekend after Memorial
[33:04] weekend so but it is Memorial Easter is
[33:09] Memorial to us and there are just a lot
[33:12] of things that we can be grateful for at

[33:56] we will not be in this building because
[33:59] beginning Friday a lot of the instrument
[34:06] and the rest of things here will be
[34:07] disconnected but Brad Jordan and sister
[34:11] faith have decided to set up something
[34:13] that we can use until we are able to
[34:16] come back to the building so services
[34:20] will be run from the earth set up and we
[34:24] are very grateful in in such a time that

[34:44] know as the work progressed and but we
[34:49] are hoping that before the first Sunday
[34:53] in May we can be back in the building so
[34:57] let's just keep it before the Lord in
[35:00] prayer and we just want to thank all the
[35:02] brothers brother Steve brothers our

[42:03] house praise the Lord Amen that's why we
[42:08] want to speak on tonight alarm foreign
[42:13] house
[42:14] praise the Lord is it's kind of a
[42:17] strange data
[42:21] strange to us but I don't believe that
[42:24] any of this is taking our Lord God by
[42:28] surprise is he had it all playing out in
[42:32] and he just just choose to surprise us
[42:36] this way praise the Lord and we know
[42:40] that he's going to he's going to come
[42:44] out beautiful and actually I was
[42:47] thinking on this subject when I spoke on
[42:50] the message after talking on the message
[42:53] we spoke on the the secret place of the
[42:55] Most High and and we were using trying
[43:01] to talk about the word the dwelling
[43:03] place God's dwelling place the dwelling
[43:06] place of the Most High and and we used a
[43:08] word like I share with you that dear
[43:14] sister share with me and that word
[43:18] Iko s does that comes from the word week
[43:22] and also means dwelling and as spoken
[43:29] during and read word that word also
[43:33] means a household it speaks of a family
[43:37] I was actually going to speak on call
[43:42] household in the sense of where the
[43:44] scripture says that you know Moses had a
[43:50] household and and God was pleased with
[43:53] his household and and and Paul used that
[43:57] in a book of Hebrew and he says Christ
[44:00] also have a household and whose
[44:03] household we are and as I was thinking
[44:06] about there then then they start of a
[44:10] lamb for a house came to my mind and and
[44:16] I started reading the scripture and it
[44:19] was beautiful as we as we will look
[44:21] through the scripture tonight actually
[44:28] I was speaking with a brother and he
[44:30] started sharing did some time with me so
[44:34] it kind of caught my mind into this
[44:36] subject as I was reading through the
[44:39] book of Exodus and trying to closely
[44:41] look at the different things that are
[44:44] right out there in the book of Exodus
[44:46] chapter 12 so we we want to talk about
[44:50] alarm for a house and I believe there is
[44:54] no time that this can come so important
[44:57] to us especially around this time where
[45:00] we have to be sitting in our home around
[45:02] the Word of God and actually holding the
[45:06] lamb in our hands God's Word and and you
[45:09] know following the service and I mean
[45:12] that just how it was in over there in
[45:16] Goshen and every family how to take
[45:18] alarm for a house praise the Lord and as
[45:22] we look at the subject about taking the
[45:25] lamb for the house now we have to also
[45:27] realize that is going to be the very
[45:29] same lamb whose blood they're going to
[45:32] put on the link head of the doorpost and
[45:34] that is going to be the very same line
[45:36] whom they are going to the gonna eat
[45:38] that lamb with bitter herbs getting
[45:40] ready for the Exeter that evening so
[45:43] they had to take alarm for the house
[45:46] like the scripture says if the family
[45:48] was a small number they had to join to
[45:51] another family and they take the lamb
[45:53] and do everything as so well as a join
[45:57] together they had to bring all the both
[45:59] families together honor their household
[46:02] and it will eat the lamb together and it
[46:07] will all stay under the protection of
[46:09] the blood getting ready for the accident
[46:13] praise the Lord so and we know that I
[46:17] think on Sunday she's Billa went over to
[46:21] brother Dan house and brother Lorenson
[46:25] and brother Steven their family are
[46:29] gathering together everybody trying to
[46:31] make church and you know the journey
[46:32] together and I just think that's
[46:34] beautiful praise the Lord and so tonight
[46:38] as we look at this I want to actually
[46:42] look at something year that kind of a
[46:45] play out in the prophecies so let's go
[46:47] back to the book of Hebrew I mean the
[46:49] book of Exodus and we will read that
[46:52] Scripture again because actually this
[46:59] was what that kind of for caught my mind
[47:01] in the in the reading year the Bible
[47:05] says that God speaks spoke unto them and
[47:09] he said verse 2 that this man shall be
[47:13] unto you the beginning of months so we
[47:16] see that God is giving them time here
[47:19] he's going he's starting out a colonic
[47:22] with them he's starting out as ceasing
[47:24] with them and everything that we'll have
[47:27] four four four dates and ceasing and
[47:30] this actually is even going to affect
[47:32] their time as we see closely here
[47:37] because as you look in the scripture
[47:39] you'll realize that the Bible speaks of
[47:44] you know the sixth hour and the nine
[47:47] hour and in the twelve hours you know
[47:50] completely different from that from the
[47:52] way we call our time and and and all of
[47:56] that started right here in Exodus
[47:59] chapter 12 verse 2 when God said unto
[48:03] them that this man shall be the
[48:06] beginning of months it shall be the
[48:10] first month of the year to you that
[48:14] affected not only the amounts it
[48:17] affected their weeks that's the reason
[48:19] why the seventy week of Daniel is a
[48:22] prophetic week it all comes from right
[48:25] here God was giving them a calendar he
[48:28] was giving them a timeline on a weecha
[48:31] all prophecy will be fulfilled that's
[48:34] the reason why Israel remained our time
[48:37] peace praise the Lord
[48:41] Israel remain our time peace when when
[48:46] when when Bible scholars or or different
[48:49] men in the ages like you go you know you
[48:52] look on the media use
[48:54] people trying to determine time and they
[48:57] are trying to and they're working all of
[48:59] that in the Roman calendar you can never
[49:02] come out right we can never come out
[49:09] right if if we try to work on all of
[49:12] these things within the Roman calendar
[49:14] because year God was establishing a
[49:18] calendar he was establishing a timeline
[49:21] he was establishing he established mom
[49:25] he established week he established days
[49:27] he establish our z-- he established
[49:30] meaning and everything they have to do
[49:32] in time and with prophecy was
[49:35] established right here praise the Lord I
[49:38] want to begin with that the beginning of
[49:41] months are we to get him and there shall
[49:47] be the first month of the year - you
[49:50] speak ye unto all the congregation of
[49:54] Israel in the tenth day of this month
[50:00] shall they take on to them every man a
[50:05] lamb I call him told that the house of
[50:10] their fathers alarm for on house now I
[50:15] want us to also realize that it was
[50:17] going to be the tenth day of that month
[50:21] they were supposed to take a lamb praise
[50:25] the Lord
[50:31] okay then he go ahead and he talks about
[50:34] you know if the lamb if the family is
[50:39] small he can join to another family
[50:45] verse five your lamb shall be without
[50:51] blemish now which means for you to for
[50:54] you to make sure that your lamb will be
[50:57] without blemish means that you have to
[50:59] examine your lamb so the lamb must be
[51:04] caught on the tenth day and be
[51:07] gaining from the tempting the lamb must
[51:10] be assuming you have to look at it are
[51:14] we together
[51:15] a male of the first year you should take
[51:24] it out from the sheep or from the gods
[51:30] so on the 10th thing you go and take
[51:35] this lamb and you must separate it you
[51:39] must take it from amount of sheeps and a
[51:42] goal you must set it apart and you you
[51:45] should begin to examine the lamb are we
[51:48] together praise the Lord
[51:54] verse 6 and yes I keep it up until the
[52:01] fourteenth day of the same month and the
[52:07] whole Assembly of the congregation of
[52:11] Israel shall kill it in the evening
[52:15] praise the Lord now so we see here that
[52:19] God has has already established a
[52:23] calendar and he is establishing a
[52:26] timeline for them here giving them dead
[52:29] and ceasing because he he told them to
[52:32] remember this to do it you know as to
[52:35] get out of out of Egypt they have to
[52:37] remember this all the time but what I
[52:39] want us to look at tonight is there he
[52:42] told he told them to take this lamb on
[52:46] the tempting separated from all the
[52:48] ships and the gold keep it he says they
[52:53] should keep it until the 14 days now
[52:59] over and over
[53:00] you read let me take 1 year huh I kind
[53:11] of
[53:11] escape something year but I saw that
[53:14] over the oil I speak to the rock 1953
[53:18] let's just read this together you see
[53:20] what I'm talking about
[53:27] he says now it must be a male lamb
[53:32] without blemish perfect type of Christ
[53:36] the first one from the OL mother away he
[53:42] says all Christ was in the lamb to
[53:47] everything in the Bible point to Christ
[53:52] you can't pick a thing in a Bible but
[53:56] what goes to Christ and the first mother
[54:00] the first lamb from the mother
[54:02] and so then keep him up 14 days now if
[54:09] you look at it like that if you look at
[54:12] it like that it would break the time
[54:16] praise the Lord
[54:18] the scripture says the lamb must be set
[54:21] aside on the tenth day until the
[54:25] fourteenth day but not kept for 14 days
[54:31] praise the Lord
[54:33] now it's two different there we will see
[54:36] where you see what I'm getting to year
[54:38] he says kept up kept I kept him up 14
[54:43] days he was to be assuming washing a
[54:48] blemish on him and he was to be killed
[54:52] in there evening that you notice it
[54:55] Christ wasn't killed in the morning they
[54:58] took him in the morning and hang him on
[55:02] the cross at 9 o clock but it was in the
[55:12] evening before he died is that right and
[55:18] watch this lamb must be killed by
[55:23] all of Israel and the others must come
[55:27] around and witness to this sacrificial
[55:32] lamb perfect type of Christ how that
[55:36] they all said a we're with him we would
[55:41] take Barabbas but we will let loose
[55:46] Barabbas and take Jesus all of Israel
[55:52] lay their hands on Jesus he was a
[55:57] perfect lamb praise the Lord
[56:00] now so I want us to go back to this time
[56:02] the lamb is is detected lamb on the
[56:06] tenth day of the month and he had to be
[56:10] kept he had to be separated from all all
[56:14] the ships and a god and he also have to
[56:18] be assuming there need be no spot on him
[56:20] so when we actually realized you see
[56:23] here from the 10th to the 14th is four
[56:27] days so the lamb must be as I mean four
[56:33] days
[56:35] praise Lord
[56:46] and we together now God's chosen place
[56:50] of worship 1965 Marie Brennan would
[56:56] bring this out much clearer year he says
[57:00] the lamb is to be kept up now this is
[57:05] found in the exit of to earth if you are
[57:07] mocking it down Exeter 12 the tear verse
[57:10] to the six
[57:11] he said the lamb must be kept for four
[57:15] days to be trying to see if it's walking
[57:22] to go to the sacrifice yet now you see
[57:27] that is the reason why I wanted to
[57:29] differentiate between the 14 days
[57:31] because I got I got I got my mind a
[57:34] little bit you know caught up in that
[57:37] and I just could not see it on Tarawa
[57:40] you know I had a read it over and over
[57:43] again because over and over you will see
[57:45] there is many places where where Brennan
[57:47] says the lamb must be kept for 14 days
[57:50] you know so but it actually break the
[57:54] tie because it would go over you know it
[57:59] will go over a Sabbath
[58:02] praise the Lord now so he says here the
[58:11] lamb must be kept for four days to be
[58:14] tried to see if if its water to be - I
[58:19] mean water to go toward the sacrifice
[58:21] yet as I mean over and over for four
[58:27] days to see if there's any blemish on it
[58:31] see if there's any sickness in it see if
[58:35] there is anything wrong anything wrong
[58:38] with the lamb it must be kept out for
[58:42] days over and over they have to examine
[58:45] it they have to look behind the ears
[58:46] they have to look under the chain they
[58:49] have to look all over the land it had to
[58:52] be examined from four days and we
[58:54] realize when Jesus was arrested bourbon
[58:57] we see a little bit on there
[58:59] here we realize that was exactly what
[59:01] happened in a scripture
[59:03] he went from pilothouse he went to this
[59:05] other place to be as I mean he went
[59:07] before the high priest to be as I mean
[59:09] it was just right in Scripture praise
[59:13] the Lord because he was the Lamb of God
[59:17] he says now I know somebody might might
[59:21] have thought that was a little bit kill
[59:26] on on the 14 but you remember they took
[59:31] the lamb on the tenth day of the month
[59:34] and kill it on the 14th they of the man
[59:40] seed which was kept up for four days now
[59:48] Jesus girls named lamb went into
[59:53] Jerusalem and never came out again until
[59:58] after his death his burial in
[1:00:02] resurrection he was kept up on the
[1:00:06] critics for four days and four night how
[1:00:13] perfect the lamb was tied kept up for
[1:00:16] four days
[1:00:17] that's when Pilate said I can't find no
[1:00:21] fault in him prays alone
[1:00:27] amen so you see God establishing the
[1:00:33] beginning of months and he's
[1:00:35] establishing whatever the the pass over
[1:00:42] with Israel it was because he had this
[1:00:45] picture in his mind he had in his mind
[1:00:48] exactly the time and it did everything
[1:00:51] layout of how our Lord Jesus would go
[1:00:54] through but actually what we're talking
[1:00:56] about tonight is the importance of
[1:00:59] Israel taking alarm for a house praise
[1:01:05] the Lord and in a way that the scripture
[1:01:08] said it alarm for a house
[1:01:12] speaking to the term that this family
[1:01:17] had to identify themselves with the line
[1:01:20] they have to know that this land is the
[1:01:25] land that will be killed to nine and
[1:01:27] this line is the line whose blood is
[1:01:30] going to be on the adult poles to save
[1:01:33] them away from the death danger
[1:01:37] praise the Lord
[1:01:41] strange you know that God never told him
[1:01:43] to take a lamb and let it be the Lamb of
[1:01:46] their church or be the Lamb of the
[1:01:48] tabernacle but the alarm has to be
[1:01:51] alarmed that is identified with your
[1:01:53] family it's alarmed for a house the lamb
[1:01:59] was not alarmed for the attract the lamb
[1:02:04] was not alarmed for the ination it's all
[1:02:08] because God be with his people as a
[1:02:11] family he deeds with his people his
[1:02:15] children as a household Joshua said me
[1:02:19] and my house will serve the Lord praise
[1:02:23] the Lord
[1:02:24] the scripture says speaking about Moses
[1:02:29] stranger if you if you will look look
[1:02:31] with me in a little bit here Amen praise
[1:02:38] the Lord
[1:02:45] numbers chapter 12
[1:02:57] normal chapter 12
[1:03:10] praise the Lord
[1:03:21] numbers chapter 12 will read here we
[1:03:25] know this was when Aaron and Marian got
[1:03:29] into trouble but God comes down here and
[1:03:33] he says verse 5 and the Lord came down
[1:03:37] in the pillow of cloud and stood in the
[1:03:41] door of the tabernacle and called Aaron
[1:03:44] and Miriam and they both came forth and
[1:03:47] he said yea now my words if there be a
[1:03:52] prophet among you I the Lord will make
[1:03:55] myself known unto him in a vision and
[1:03:59] will speak unto him in in a dream
[1:04:03] my 7 Moses is not so who is faithful in
[1:04:10] all my house praise the Lord Amen now
[1:04:20] I'm looking at the phrase hear God
[1:04:22] speaking to to Aaron and Miriam after
[1:04:29] they have make a poor judgment and and
[1:04:33] he's telling them that Moses is not like
[1:04:35] any others a profit of 7 mind he says
[1:04:40] this man is faithful in my house now
[1:04:45] let's let's look at another parallel to
[1:04:47] the scripture over in Hebrews chapter 3
[1:04:53] Hebrews chapter 3 verse 2
[1:05:14] hebrews chapter 3 verse 2 the scripture
[1:05:16] says who was faithful to him that
[1:05:20] appointed him as also Moses was faithful
[1:05:28] in all his house verse 3 for this man
[1:05:35] was counted worthy of more glory than
[1:05:40] Moses in as much as he who have built
[1:05:46] the house have more honor than the house
[1:05:51] praise the Lord
[1:05:53] now so we we see here I was thinking
[1:05:55] about this over there in numbers God is
[1:05:59] talking to Aaron Mary and since I know
[1:06:02] my 7 Moses is not like what you think my
[1:06:05] 7 Moses is faithful in all of my house
[1:06:09] which of course he means that he has
[1:06:12] kept everything he has kept the people
[1:06:15] together he has care because God comes
[1:06:18] down there in Exeter and tell Moses that
[1:06:21] he want to deal with these people
[1:06:23] as a family of priests yeah I mean not
[1:06:26] just setting one tribe aside our setting
[1:06:29] one group of people aside but he want to
[1:06:31] deal with the entire congregation
[1:06:33] so God always deal with his people as a
[1:06:37] household and that was the reason why a
[1:06:39] house media to have a lamb it was alarm
[1:06:45] for a house and that's the reason why we
[1:06:49] have one lamb for this house and the
[1:06:52] lamb is the Lamb of God Jesus Christ but
[1:06:55] if you see here the scripture speaks in
[1:06:59] a sense over in numbers God says Moses
[1:07:02] is faithful in all of my house and over
[1:07:06] in a Hebrew in Scripture almost speaks
[1:07:10] like Moses was faithful and when it
[1:07:13] speaks about the house it almost speaks
[1:07:15] like it was Moses house praise the Lord
[1:07:21] and
[1:07:23] almost like our family God makes a man
[1:07:28] the head of the family he makes the
[1:07:31] woman the mother of the home but we have
[1:07:33] to realize that our homes
[1:07:35] I'm not our homes that home is gospel
[1:07:39] praise the Lord
[1:07:41] a brother told me the story about a man
[1:07:51] that had a construction company and he
[1:07:55] had all of these men working with him
[1:07:57] and they would go and build homes for
[1:08:01] people people would hire them
[1:08:04] that's what construction workers does
[1:08:06] and one day he took this work out of his
[1:08:11] and he told him it's just what I want
[1:08:13] you to build me a house here and let it
[1:08:17] be a story building that should be a
[1:08:18] house of you know four-bedroom and
[1:08:22] everything he says but you have worked
[1:08:24] with me so long and you know the kind of
[1:08:27] a material I use you know you know how I
[1:08:30] like my house to be I'll give it to you
[1:08:33] you draw the house you know draw the
[1:08:35] planning and you build it while the I
[1:08:39] mean the the work of fair so challenge
[1:08:42] how can he give me I mean if this house
[1:08:46] is for someone I mean there should be a
[1:08:48] plan and I mean and and the boss said
[1:08:51] you go ahead and do it it's just well it
[1:08:54] is there no blue brain he says well you
[1:08:58] make a blueprint says well I there and
[1:09:03] the materials he said well you come down
[1:09:06] to the warehouse until whatever you want
[1:09:09] and build their house you know what just
[1:09:13] do just the way you want to build it so
[1:09:15] he Noreen the kind of a quality material
[1:09:19] there his boss always used he went down
[1:09:23] to the warehouse I mean he hi everything
[1:09:25] to his disposal he just took what he
[1:09:27] needs and he build the house put the
[1:09:31] house up whatever way the kitchen was he
[1:09:35] had to decide the
[1:09:37] the bathroom was he had to decide and
[1:09:39] when he finished with the house he came
[1:09:41] to the bus and told the bus I'm done I
[1:09:44] said well okay and this is the key would
[1:09:51] you like to come and see the house he
[1:09:53] said well yeah I might drive by one of
[1:09:55] these days he said well you take the key
[1:09:58] you built it so you live in it whatever
[1:10:03] where you build it it becomes your house
[1:10:06] whatever way you put it together you are
[1:10:08] the one that going to live in it if you
[1:10:12] eat them a dump the money for the
[1:10:14] material and you just put a scaffold
[1:10:17] work up you going to live in it you and
[1:10:19] your family praise the Lord
[1:10:24] over in numbers God says Moses he's
[1:10:28] faithful in all of my house praise the
[1:10:34] Lord
[1:10:40] and when actually did that Israel become
[1:10:45] a house of God when when did God
[1:10:48] actually look at them when did he ever
[1:10:50] brought them together and put them in in
[1:10:52] that unit of a household right there in
[1:10:56] Exodus chapter 12 now we have to also
[1:11:00] realize here that brother Branham said
[1:11:02] that if Israel if a man was not going to
[1:11:09] bring his household together if he was
[1:11:13] not going to take alarm and make sure
[1:11:15] that a lamb was assuming very well and
[1:11:18] just like the way God wanted it to be if
[1:11:21] he never killed a lamb and in the
[1:11:24] evening time if he never takes the blood
[1:11:27] and put it on the lintel of the doorpost
[1:11:29] Parabellum said even if that man was
[1:11:32] second size on the eighth day under the
[1:11:34] Covenant of Abraham God would despise
[1:11:38] that praise the Lord
[1:11:43] so yeah we realize that God gave Abraham
[1:11:46] a covenant on a warmer he identified
[1:11:51] Abraham and it looks like it was a seal
[1:11:54] on told the sons of Abraham circumcised
[1:11:58] on the eighth egg all the male in the
[1:12:00] house and every male that was born how
[1:12:02] to be circumcised on the eighth day God
[1:12:04] was even going to kill Moses because he
[1:12:08] didn't that second side his son on the
[1:12:10] eighth day but here when it comes under
[1:12:12] the talking when it comes to the token
[1:12:15] message when it comes to what God was
[1:12:18] establishing here in Exodus chapter 12
[1:12:21] if a man would not take a lamb if you
[1:12:25] will not bring his household all of the
[1:12:27] lamb praise the Lord
[1:12:30] if he will not follow God's instruction
[1:12:35] the covenant of circumcision God would
[1:12:38] despise it praise the Lord
[1:12:47] God will despise it and we also have to
[1:12:52] realize that God kept them honor the
[1:12:58] talking he kept them on the Covenant of
[1:13:01] Exodus chapter 12 it was back in the
[1:13:05] promised land before God will revive the
[1:13:08] covenant of circumcision as they travel
[1:13:11] they all travel down for 40 years they
[1:13:15] were having children they were not
[1:13:17] second sizing they were not doing just
[1:13:19] like their fathers did it did not bother
[1:13:22] God until they got to the promised land
[1:13:27] in the book of Joshua that God told
[1:13:31] Joshua to second size the people the
[1:13:33] second time before the covenant of
[1:13:35] circumcision was revived so here is that
[1:13:41] God was keeping his people honor a
[1:13:44] promise and what is that promise alarm
[1:13:46] for a house he was dealing with them as
[1:13:49] a household as each family was
[1:13:54] identified with a lamb praise the Lord
[1:13:59] and that's what we do as a family
[1:14:05] because church actually starts from whom
[1:14:08] I mean church starts from the family
[1:14:12] altar praise the Lord
[1:14:17] because we we need to be identified with
[1:14:20] the word not identified with the name
[1:14:22] not identified with a building not
[1:14:25] identified with a location our
[1:14:26] identification it's waived the lamb
[1:14:31] that's the reason why God give them a
[1:14:35] new beginning this will be the beginning
[1:14:37] of a month this will be the beginning of
[1:14:42] months actually the beginning of your
[1:14:44] year your days will begin from right
[1:14:47] here when you come on this line when you
[1:14:52] come on there you come into a household
[1:14:55] and has a lamb at this particular time
[1:14:58] of the year that's
[1:14:59] when your new beginning stats praise the
[1:15:05] Lord Amen alarm for a house church
[1:15:14] actually starts from home praise the
[1:15:18] Lord
[1:15:19] that's where we pray up that's why we
[1:15:22] prepared our mind that's why we prepare
[1:15:24] our family before we come together in
[1:15:31] church can only be successful when it's
[1:15:33] a household praise the Lord because God
[1:15:39] is dealing with his household the church
[1:15:44] is God's family
[1:15:47] Paul says whose house we are Christ also
[1:15:52] was faithful in his house just like how
[1:15:56] Moses was faithful in his house one time
[1:15:59] it was God's house but because he did
[1:16:03] everything that was right he built the
[1:16:05] tabernacle in a way that God wanted it
[1:16:08] he led the people in a way that God
[1:16:10] wanted it when they came through the
[1:16:12] blood God says Moses is no longer my
[1:16:14] house it's your house
[1:16:17] Moses was faithful in his house praise
[1:16:24] the Lord I mean you see that's the thing
[1:16:29] that will be our reward on the other
[1:16:32] side as parents we are just to us amen
[1:16:38] everything that God gave us he want for
[1:16:42] us to keep it under the talking and that
[1:16:45] is the only place where it would prosper
[1:16:50] you think about it now the Covenant of
[1:16:54] circumcision God was not even looking at
[1:16:59] that until they got back in the promised
[1:17:01] land because he says that was the place
[1:17:03] I promised Abraham that was the place
[1:17:05] where I gave Abraham the Covenant of
[1:17:07] circumcision so until you get back there
[1:17:10] we will keep there for that time or
[1:17:12] you have to bring your family under the
[1:17:18] token message praise the Lord
[1:17:22] amen and I was talking fellowshiping
[1:17:27] with someone around that thought of the
[1:17:30] talking message the talking message is
[1:17:32] not a talking it's just a message of the
[1:17:36] talking praise the Lord Amen as many you
[1:17:44] know takes a like bird benches over in
[1:17:46] feasts of the trumpet you know where he
[1:17:49] where he types the message receiving the
[1:17:51] message of the hour as an evidence of
[1:17:54] the Holy Ghost it's actually receiving
[1:17:57] Christ in our soul is not only receiving
[1:18:00] the messenger and knowing about the
[1:18:02] message but receiving the message of the
[1:18:04] hour is Jesus Christ the message of the
[1:18:12] hour is now baptized a baptism in jesus
[1:18:15] name is part of the message the message
[1:18:17] of the hour is net taking communion it's
[1:18:20] not a addressing this in the message of
[1:18:23] the hour in his fullness is Jesus Christ
[1:18:29] Christ in you the hope of glory he is
[1:18:33] the lamb for this house praise the Lord
[1:18:37] we must take alarm for a house now part
[1:18:41] of the lamb the the scripture never told
[1:18:44] him I mean if your family is small just
[1:18:46] take a leg no they had to be identified
[1:18:50] with the entire line so if your family
[1:18:53] is small don't just take part go and
[1:18:57] join a family where you people can
[1:18:58] partake of the entire land now taking
[1:19:02] half of the word and leaving half we
[1:19:05] must partake of all of the word the
[1:19:11] fullness of the word because the
[1:19:14] fullness of God dwelleth in him alarm
[1:19:18] for an house praise the Lord
[1:19:22] the children must all partake of the
[1:19:25] alarm
[1:19:26] the mother must partake of the lamb the
[1:19:29] father must must partake of the lamb and
[1:19:31] that is the way that God looks at his
[1:19:35] church as a family
[1:19:38] praise the Lord
[1:19:45] so if we can be faithful in our house or
[1:19:50] faithful in God's house when we get on
[1:19:54] the other side he will reward us just
[1:19:58] like he did to all of his seven we know
[1:20:02] bird Brennan vision of that Baptist boy
[1:20:06] that came in prophesy over him a huge
[1:20:08] portion of heaven it would be because
[1:20:13] you have make a choice and you have
[1:20:15] taken a narrow way praise the Lord Amen
[1:20:20] alarm for a house now part of the lamb
[1:20:24] the entire line and everyone in their
[1:20:29] house have to be identified with that
[1:20:32] lamb praise the Lord
[1:20:36] realizing that this is the lamb blood
[1:20:38] that is going to keep them away from the
[1:20:40] Deaf injure I mean even the little boy
[1:20:43] you don't have to sit down and say well
[1:20:44] my daddy has already as I'm in the lamb
[1:20:47] or the mother sit there and says well
[1:20:50] yeah you know my hobby has already as a
[1:20:52] middle on that lamb is going to stand
[1:20:55] between day and a deaf angel
[1:20:57] I believe the mother will go after and
[1:21:00] check and say honey are you sure you
[1:21:02] look behind the ears
[1:21:04] there is no spot there and that little
[1:21:09] Junior sauce here for his life was say
[1:21:12] was it that you look at the leg properly
[1:21:14] they said exactly I mean an entire
[1:21:17] family have to be identified with the
[1:21:20] lamb because it has to meet God's
[1:21:23] requirement praise the Lord
[1:21:26] not giving the responsibility all to the
[1:21:30] parents or giving a responsibility you
[1:21:32] know to the husband all to the wild we
[1:21:34] all must be identified with our land
[1:21:40] praise the Lord
[1:21:43] Alam to a house glory be to God so we
[1:21:52] realized here the Lamb has to be as a me
[1:21:59] but where Branham says four days over
[1:22:02] and over
[1:22:03] Christ was was examine they took him
[1:22:06] from from the high priests place and
[1:22:08] then they took him over to - to Pilate
[1:22:11] Porsche and took him to Caesar and all
[1:22:15] of that they had to examine him over and
[1:22:18] over to make sure and then and then
[1:22:21] librarian says and Pilate finally say I
[1:22:23] find no fault in him and there he turned
[1:22:26] him over to the Jews for him to be
[1:22:30] crucified praise the Lord
[1:22:34] now so we see here that the lamb has to
[1:22:41] be taken on the tenth day and kept up
[1:22:44] and till the 14 days when it had to be
[1:22:51] sacrificed and I had to be killed on the
[1:22:56] fourth day after it has been as I mean
[1:23:00] praise the Lord
[1:23:05] now we were we were kind of a local time
[1:23:08] here a little bit just bear with me
[1:23:12] let's look at st. John chapter 11 I have
[1:23:21] about 10 minutes to be out of here
[1:23:23] so I hope I can be able to to do justice
[1:23:30] to my toes tonight praise the Lord
[1:23:34] since John chapter 11 that's in John
[1:23:39] chapter 11 speaks of
[1:23:46] verse nine and jesus answered there not
[1:23:55] twelve hours in the day if any man walk
[1:24:03] in the dark he stumble if enemy walk in
[1:24:10] the day sorry
[1:24:10] he stumble net because he seared the
[1:24:13] light of this world but if any man walk
[1:24:17] in the night he stumbleth because there
[1:24:20] is no light in him
[1:24:23] praise the Lord now talking about light
[1:24:26] we realize here that Jesus was not
[1:24:28] referring to the natural light of the
[1:24:30] day he was referring to the revelation
[1:24:32] of the word that a man has received for
[1:24:34] his day but this is what I wanted to
[1:24:36] point out here he says here I didn't met
[1:24:40] twelve hours in a day now so just like
[1:24:44] how God gave them the beginning of
[1:24:47] months that starts dear calendar as I
[1:24:50] said Israel time was completely
[1:24:52] different praise the Lord
[1:24:57] they cancelled their time by 12 hours
[1:25:01] that was in the day now you can see here
[1:25:04] that in this 12 hours Jesus he's taking
[1:25:08] a portion for the night and the portion
[1:25:10] for the day that there is time to walk
[1:25:13] in in in the day so they just look at a
[1:25:16] little bit of death when we did wash me
[1:25:25] and what of the night we went over the
[1:25:28] time a little bit there are six hours
[1:25:31] was our noon there six hours was our
[1:25:38] noon the nine hours was our free o'clock
[1:25:43] in the afternoon
[1:25:48] so because we will see that when it gets
[1:25:51] over into let's get to mark chapter 15 a
[1:25:54] little bit
[1:26:13] now you see that is the reason why you
[1:26:17] can see clearly that when Jesus says no
[1:26:20] man will know the day and the hour you
[1:26:24] can see right here why no man we know
[1:26:27] the day and the hour because he's coming
[1:26:29] on the time of prophecy he's coming on
[1:26:33] the timeline of prophecy and eurasia we
[1:26:36] are caught up in a Roman calendar and we
[1:26:39] look at everything through January 2 2 2
[1:26:43] 2 December we look at everything from
[1:26:46] 1:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight but he's
[1:26:50] coming on the time of prophecy that is
[1:26:52] the reason why we cannot put a time my
[1:27:03] chapter 15 we see here in verse 25 and
[1:27:10] it was the terror hour and they
[1:27:17] crucified Him praise the Lord
[1:27:26] verse 33 of the same
[1:27:39] and when the sixth hour was come there
[1:27:45] was darkness over the whole land until
[1:27:51] the ninth hour and at the ninth hour
[1:27:58] Jesus cried with a loud voice my God my
[1:28:05] God why have that forsaken me praise the
[1:28:09] Lord
[1:28:10] now so and we will realize that that
[1:28:20] that that time of the day they had nine
[1:28:24] hour where Jesus give up the ghost we
[1:28:30] will see that it was just about what
[1:28:33] what will be our 3 hour 3 p.m. amen and
[1:28:39] we will see in a structure that it was
[1:28:46] the hour of prayer as chapter 3 verse 1
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:23] okay they already have it up there
[1:29:26] Imperial John went up together into the
[1:29:29] temple at the hour of prayer being the
[1:29:32] ninth ow
[1:29:36] it means now so like like most of the
[1:29:44] time when we read in the scripture like
[1:29:48] Jesus said or pauses that evening he
[1:29:52] says that very evening where he was
[1:29:54] betrayed he took bread and him and he
[1:29:58] bless it and for our timeline for Israel
[1:30:05] the I evening because I call it to the
[1:30:09] scripture the the the the sacrifice was
[1:30:14] between two evenings they call it two
[1:30:16] evenings and I would just look at the
[1:30:19] scripture here a little bit so we can we
[1:30:22] can see let's look at Exodus chapter 29
[1:30:41] x2 the 29 that was when they did their
[1:30:44] daily sacrifice Exeter chapter 29 verse
[1:30:51] 38
[1:31:03] exit 29 verse 38 okay and I know I'm
[1:31:11] looking in the wrong place here now now
[1:31:16] this now this is that which thou shalt
[1:31:21] offer upon the altar to lambs of the
[1:31:29] first year day by day
[1:31:33] continuously and 39 the one lamb there
[1:31:40] shall offer in the morning and the other
[1:31:44] lamb there shall offer at evening
[1:31:48] praise the Lord now this was the the a
[1:31:56] daily sacrifice they had the the morning
[1:31:59] line that he had to offered and he had
[1:32:01] the evening lamb that he had to offer
[1:32:03] now so bringing it over to the Lamb of
[1:32:07] God one type that we can take is the
[1:32:11] other taking alarm for a house you know
[1:32:14] as as our home principle we have to
[1:32:17] approach the word you know in the
[1:32:19] morning you know that's the Moni
[1:32:22] sacrifice and we have to approach the
[1:32:25] word in the evening that's how they kept
[1:32:28] their daily sacrifice that was for the
[1:32:31] principle of their daily sacrifice so
[1:32:34] there was a lamb that was killed in the
[1:32:35] morning and there was a lamb that was
[1:32:37] killed in the evening and that applied
[1:32:40] to the believer life of you know having
[1:32:43] the time spending time with the word in
[1:32:45] the morning
[1:32:46] spending time with the Lord in the
[1:32:48] evening setting that as a principle of
[1:32:51] the evening sacrifice and the morning
[1:32:53] sacrifice because that very same lamb
[1:32:56] that saved them at the time of the
[1:32:59] Passover was a type of every lamb that
[1:33:02] was sacrificed doing their daily
[1:33:05] sacrifice praise the Lord
[1:33:26] now so for I mean for for Israel in
[1:33:31] their timeline just like how we look at
[1:33:34] the 6:00 hour and the nine-hour year
[1:33:37] their six-hour will be our our noon the
[1:33:42] 9:00 hour will be 3:00 p.m. so with with
[1:33:47] with Israel the evening time was anytime
[1:33:52] between the the 6:00 hour and the
[1:33:58] 12-hour because if you go back to
[1:34:03] Genesis the Bible says and God said let
[1:34:06] there be light and there was light
[1:34:08] there evening and the morning there was
[1:34:12] nothing like afternoon it was the
[1:34:17] evening and the morning was the first
[1:34:20] day the evening and the morning was the
[1:34:24] second day all of those are these
[1:34:30] principle and principles that line up
[1:34:32] with prophecy praise the Lord that is
[1:34:41] the reason why with with the Jews
[1:34:45] anything after after a 12 o'clock they
[1:34:50] are already India evening time and they
[1:34:53] can have their communion they can have
[1:34:57] the Lord's Supper because they are they
[1:35:01] are right India evening time according
[1:35:03] to their timeline now you are myself
[1:35:05] with struggle with it and says well it's
[1:35:08] after noon but the Bible says it was in
[1:35:10] the evening
[1:35:10] that that are the top cop they took the
[1:35:14] wine and Jesus bless the bread and we
[1:35:17] put our evening time into our clock
[1:35:19] evening time and we struggle with that
[1:35:26] but with Israel it was the evening in
[1:35:29] the morning they never they don't have
[1:35:31] anything like an afternoon
[1:35:33] India India in their timeline
[1:35:40] praise the Lord because the sacrifice
[1:35:44] had to be killed between two evenings
[1:35:48] and these two evening was from 12 noon
[1:35:52] to 12 midnight praise the Lord
[1:35:56] amen it was now two evenings like you
[1:36:01] would think of two evenings of two
[1:36:02] different days it was because the
[1:36:08] evening starts with them from 12 noon
[1:36:10] and they ain't at 12 midnight are we
[1:36:17] together taking the house taking the
[1:36:22] lamb for the house praise the Lord
[1:36:28] now when you look at taking the morning
[1:36:31] sacrifice and the evening sacrifice is
[1:36:34] so easy you know for us in a way that
[1:36:38] were my run it looks like I mean I have
[1:36:42] to you know I get to myself and you know
[1:36:45] my morning prayers and my evening
[1:36:47] prayers all of those things are
[1:36:49] wonderful having that discipline in our
[1:36:51] life as Christians to spend the time
[1:36:53] with the word but you just look at the
[1:36:55] sacrifice me to be killed between the
[1:36:58] two evenings so anytime in between there
[1:37:02] amen
[1:37:04] it better scale had his his his his lamb
[1:37:08] ready and he examine his LOM the
[1:37:12] scripture said it must be killed in the
[1:37:14] evening time he and his household set
[1:37:16] around the alarm and and there is I mean
[1:37:19] the lamb and they are ready to kill the
[1:37:21] lamb I'm I'm over to my heart it don't
[1:37:23] have to be just on the same hour because
[1:37:28] it was between two evenings
[1:37:37] praise the Lord you see the old the the
[1:37:42] the apostle's on us through there that
[1:37:45] is the reason why after the dead of
[1:37:48] Pentecost they could go from house to
[1:37:51] house breaking bread even if they were
[1:37:57] meeting the same day going from house to
[1:38:00] house breaking bread they were not they
[1:38:02] were not out of order in the scripture
[1:38:04] because they were keeping the sacrifice
[1:38:07] between two evenings so they have to
[1:38:14] make sure that at the beginning of the
[1:38:16] evening and before the end of the
[1:38:19] evening they have to be done with all
[1:38:21] their sacrifices praise the Lord it
[1:38:32] household alarm for a house praise the
[1:38:38] Lord
[1:38:38] the lamb is not only for the husband the
[1:38:43] lamb is for the house Paul will take
[1:38:46] that in a book of Corinthian the world
[1:38:50] if a man married and unbelieving wife or
[1:38:54] a woman a believing woman with her
[1:38:56] unbelieving husband take the alarm for
[1:38:58] the house praise the Lord
[1:39:02] just like Rahab applying the talking for
[1:39:06] her house and she had to bring all her
[1:39:09] loved ones into the house she was not
[1:39:11] comparing them she was now forcing them
[1:39:13] to believe the message that she had
[1:39:15] believed she was just making sure that
[1:39:17] the talking was placed at the right
[1:39:19] place and every one of them will be
[1:39:21] honored at covering alarm for a house
[1:39:27] praise the Lord the fate of the
[1:39:31] believing husband will keep mercy in the
[1:39:37] house and we keep the Lord moving to the
[1:39:39] heart of the unbelieving wife the faith
[1:39:42] of the believing wife would do the same
[1:39:44] for the unbelieving husband if we can
[1:39:46] take alarm for a house
[1:39:51] praise the Lord
[1:39:52] sometimes I would like of applying the
[1:39:58] word and just doing exactly what God
[1:40:00] want us to do bring us to the place of
[1:40:04] the lack of enjoying the benefit
[1:40:08] sometimes we want to get everything
[1:40:10] right and we want everything to be I
[1:40:13] mean just the way we think that is
[1:40:15] supposed to be but God lay time ceasing
[1:40:21] in his word he gave them a new beginning
[1:40:28] this is going to be the beginning of
[1:40:30] months for you a new calendar a new day
[1:40:35] is going to break fall for you when you
[1:40:38] can bring your house under the lamp Amen
[1:40:42] if we can take alarm for a house just
[1:40:45] like how it was just going back and
[1:40:49] using the word to deal with things in
[1:40:51] our lives using the word to deal with
[1:40:54] things in our family using the word to I
[1:40:59] mean to deal with our neighbors our our
[1:41:02] work but just applying the word it has
[1:41:04] to be the life you just see how the lamb
[1:41:06] was important that night no matter what
[1:41:11] the main career was it did not matter

[1:41:26] much important in the house praise the
[1:41:30] Lord

[1:41:34] was going to be killed that night but
[1:41:36] they had to love the lamb they had to
[1:41:38] appreciate the lamb because this is the
[1:41:40] lamb that would stop the death angel
[1:41:43] from striking the home they have to be
[1:41:48] so grateful to the lamb and now looking
[1:41:51] at himself

[1:41:58] be observed I mean they were all keeping
[1:42:00] your eyes

[1:42:29] important at night it was the lamb for
[1:42:32] the house praise the Lord

[1:42:44] draw all men unto me praise the Lord
[1:42:48] do we realize that our lamb is our

[1:49:21] he's the one that is Walter he's the one
[1:49:24] that have taken our place even with
[1:49:27] everything that is happening now God is
[1:49:30] not looking at how much we wash our
[1:49:32] hands so how much how many times we take
[1:49:34] by in the day which of course we must do
[1:49:37] that
[1:49:37] but the one that is going to save us is
[1:49:40] the lamb they have already taken our
[1:49:42] place the ones whose blood is on the
[1:49:45] lintel of the doorpost in the form of
[1:49:47] the Holy Spirit for the Old Testament
[1:49:50] was a blood without of life in it but

[1:49:54] us that is the indwelling of the Holy
[1:50:00] Ghost alarm for a house let's bow our
[1:50:05] heads tonight Pilate said I found no
[1:50:14] fault in him the lamb went into
[1:50:24] Jerusalem and never came out again until
[1:50:26] his death burial and resurrection he was
[1:50:33] kept up on the critics for four days and
[1:50:36] four night

[1:51:15] Easter weekend the sacred week the Jews
[1:51:23] back in the homeland and many Jews
[1:51:25] around the world they sat in their home
[1:51:28] today remembering the Passover many

[1:51:41] yet they sat in their home just like we
[1:51:44] are in our homes tonight they took the
[1:51:50] unleavened bread and it took the
[1:51:54] different things that they use for their
[1:51:56] ceremony but you said we as a Gentile
[1:52:02] bride
[1:52:03] we as Gentile believers we are not
[1:52:08] taking anything of earthly substance
[1:52:15] it's not a message it's not even a Bible
[1:52:23] it's the living Christ that we identify
[1:52:28] with tonight
[1:52:31] the Jews said in their home and they
[1:52:36] remember that night I ever wondered they
[1:52:39] will read the story of the Exeter and it
[1:52:44] will remind himself
[1:52:49] but as we sit in our homes tonight we
[1:52:55] are not taking a literal element we are
[1:53:01] not taking no earthly substance we are
[1:53:06] talking about the life of God I was
[1:53:09] spill on the cross of cavalry when God
[1:53:14] shear his own blood and he came he came
[1:53:20] back to the church in the form of the
[1:53:22] Holy Spirit as alarmed for our house not

[1:54:27] [Music]
[1:54:30] but taking alarm for this house we
[1:54:36] cannot go on the experience of our
[1:54:39] parents or the experience of another
[1:54:41] person its alarm for a house when the
[1:54:46] Holy Ghost came on the date of Pentecost
[1:54:48] the Bible says there was a pillar of
[1:54:49] light over every one of them
