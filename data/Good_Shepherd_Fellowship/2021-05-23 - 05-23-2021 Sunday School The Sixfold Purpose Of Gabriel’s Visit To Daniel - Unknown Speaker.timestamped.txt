[9:56] god starts dealing with the jews
[9:57] there'll be two prophets the 11th
[9:59] chapter will pick that up
[10:00] two anointed prophets like elijah and
[10:04] moses who i think it is and they'll
[10:06] bring great curses
[10:07] after they have seen that they have
[10:09] consolidated and rome has broken its
[10:12] covenant that prince
[10:13] in the middle of this 70th week it'll
[10:15] break its covenant with
[10:16] rome a roman will break it with israel
[10:19] and he'll cause the abomination again to
[10:21] scatter
[10:22] and there will be the great flood when
[10:24] the gentile
[10:25] remnant the sleeping virgin the dragon
[10:29] roam spurted water out of his mouth to
[10:31] make war with the remnant of a woman's
[10:33] seed
[10:34] that keep the commandments of god rome
[10:36] will do that
[10:37] a confederation church will consolidate
[10:40] them together
[10:41] and bring the jews into this
[10:42] confederation and bring them back to
[10:45] their own temple worship again
[10:46] in the just sayeth the lord out of the
[10:49] bible
[10:50] and they will have their own church they
[10:52] are walked down
[10:54] i just called it just now it's fresh
[10:57] they are now a nation recognized is that
[11:00] right
[11:02] but they have not their temple worship
[11:03] yet
[11:05] and when they establish the temple
[11:07] worship the church will be gone
[11:10] god will be dealing with the jews as a
[11:13] nation
[11:14] and then when they are brought into this
[11:17] confederation
[11:18] rome will break it in the middle of the
[11:20] 70th year
[11:21] three and a half years he'll break that
[11:23] covenant with them and cause the
[11:25] abomination and make a desolation to
[11:27] spread to the
[11:28] consummation amen then he'll take both
[11:31] protestants
[11:32] and jew and persecute them and at that
[11:34] time these two
[11:35] prophets will stand up and curse the
[11:37] earth and shall not
