chapter 32 praise the lord it's good to see you're back in the house of the lord tonight praise the lord you know uh slowly uh the christian church is beginning to drift away from the principle of god's word so it's it's always uh it's a blessing it's uh it's it's a lot of comfort and encouragement to the heart of any preacher to see your people showing off sunday evening for convenient service amen praise the lord job chapter 32 let's uh let's read from uh verse 7 job chapter 32 let's read from verse 7. i said they should speak a multitudes of years should teach wisdom now job is is uh he's either speaking a parable here or this is an expression in the sense that the many days that we live on earth we should be learning uh uh you should be able to teach us or you would think that people with great age and great education will be people that will have a lot of wisdom but it does not seem to be like that i said they should speak in multitudes of years should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them wisdom praise the lord for great men are now always wise neither do the age understand judgment praise the lord second timothy chapter three second timothy chapter three second team chapter three we want to take one verse there very familiar or maybe two verse 16 all scriptures is given by inspiration of god praise the lord am i reading from the right place okay okay i'm sure i'm not uh all scriptures are given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect which means he may be mentioned that he may grow up thoroughly furnished onto all good works let's pray together heavenly father lord we i hear this evening lord god to in this symbolic way identified ourself with the body and the blood of the lord jesus but father we know that the highest part of the the service lord is the reading of your word for no service and gathering of your people is complete without the reading of your word we have read your word and dear god we will ask that something will be said of internal value something that will draw us closer to the foot of the cross because we know lord god uh revelation 10 says in the voice the date of the voice of the seven injured when he shall begin to sound that message has gone forth there's a people on the earth that is a witness and oh god you said then time shall be no more or father we are living in those days help us now lord in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seed i want to talk a little bit on the inspiration of the almighty i was going to take something uh for example i was i was listening to uh uh the prince of the house of david you know brother branham referenced that book that's that's one of his uh favorite fashion book that uh that he used to read uh the prince of the house of david so i was i was listening to it and and and then i came to see why brother branham loved the book because uh there's a story of blambatimos that brother branham to speak about blambotimo in islam and and is portrayed in that book and and while i was reading the balkan with a few of the things that uh because this book is a fiction story of of uh uh a gentleman that wrote it and what and the way he he uh he was inspired to read the book he portrayed a young lady that had just got down to jerusalem just at the time when when jesus began his ministry john was preaching and so he went through the gospel and it is almost a story of an ordinary person okay somebody that was not attached to the disciples somebody that was not attacked because you have to realize that there were people there were people that were humans there were population living in those days and and many people had their own personal version of what they think about what was happening and all of those things are not written here so you see out of inspiration he wrote that book and he's he's playing out this person that have just come to town and he heard about a prophet preaching on jordan and he went there and listening and everybody said wow what kind of he have never we have never heard anything like that you know but uh the thing that is the other there's a difference between inspiration there's a difference between inspiration and uh and thou said the lord okay let me let me give you an example i i can read a scripture like i've just read tonight i'm about to preach i will i will use an inspiration i have an inspiration to be able to make my picture clear to you praise the lord now so as i'm as i'm i'm i'm i'm preaching by inspiration maybe uh i'm dramatizing something just so you can be i can be able to capture your attention okay to capture your attention to draw you into my picture now another preacher would come and preach from the very same scripture and he will have his inspiration praise the lord so inspiration is not interpretation praise the lord so uh i would be wrong to say when a man comes to preach from job 38 and he don't preach it like the way i preach it i said no you are wrong no that's an inspiration are we together so the the the prince of the house of david is an inspiration that a man got to be able to dramatize the ministry of jesus christ uh uh uh uh he took his inspiration from the bible but he created a story that the common people can be drawn into it are we together praise the lord but we want to talk about the inspiration of the almighty now uh back over to the book of job is is is uh it's amazing that uh you see the footprints of the holy ghost in the old testament just like like like job said here the uh in verse 8 he says here that uh uh praise the lord okay this is joke 32 i'm i'm over in 38 i'm sorry job 32 year in in in verse 8 he says but there is a spirit in man what is that spirit and he called that spirit the inspiration of the almighty and paul here in the new testament is saying all scriptures amen he's saying all scripture is given by inspiration so you can see that in the old testament the prophets they had a shadow of the holy ghost they they not had the fullness they did not have the complete understanding of what this enduring vein is but they have a a shadow they can tell that uh you know something like uh you know uh uh job saying i know my redeemer live it amen he's saying when the tree dies you know it goes and then and you know i mean out of inspiration he caught the resurrection he got a picture of the resurrection even though he asked ask a question when man die what becomes of him but then he says i know my redeemer lived praise the lord so you see it was the move of god in in in the shadow form it's almost like when you see a shadow on the wall you from a distance you can tell whether it is male or female as the shadow comes closer is it then it starts to make sense praise the lord now so while the uh so right here you realize that job job hard and understanding he had an understanding he says this should speak multitudes of years should teach wisdom because here he said he's dealing with these people all of this is three friends that is accusing him all of these guys are older guys and to job he's sitting down and thinking that i i think in my mind i'm thinking when people grow up they should get wisdom but it does not looks like that praise the lord because you find many of them you know piercing their ears and and trying to be young the more they grow up the more the one who becomes younger is the desire of man for for the new birth amen he don't want he don't want to get the new birth in god's way he want to get it his way by cutting his head and shipping it like a young boy i mean the wrinkle can tells praise the lord amen so we want to talk a little bit about inspiration tonight uh i won't keep you long if i can just use 10 meanings of your time here before we turn the service over now so uh uh paul picks this up in uh in second timothy where we just read he says all scriptures are given by inspiration praise the lord all scriptures are given by inspiration now the word inspiration the word inspiration is taken from uh uh is it's a translator word that is given to us meaning the birth of god so paul is saying every scripture was god's birth that's why jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god because every word that comes from the mouth of god is the breath of god amen let me read something to you here from black's femur needs brother branham said he said the church is the mystical body of christ born by the breath of god he says that you get it the church of god is born by the breath of god god god breath breathe into the nostril spiritually of adam and he became a living soul so what what he's saying yet is that he's taking us back to eating when god uh uh form men out of the dust and uh and and uh uh and and breath into the nostril of man praise the lord amen now do you see and understand why when adam came to life he could do nothing but do the way of god he named the animals god was okay because why all through his entire being was the breath of god it was god's own life he couldn't live any way different because he had the breath of god praise the lord now you have to also realize adam did not have parents so he he did not have the genetic war that we have the genetic war that came that comes down from our parents our grandparents grandparents our attitude our behavior our what we like and what we don't like adam did not have that all adam how was the breath of god in his nostrils so he could not do anything different praise the lord he could not do anything different that's the reason why he came he couldn't even fall because there was no falling nature in him you and myself we can fall because we have fallen nature but adam calling for praise the lord if it was not because of the love of his wife adam could not fall he was not deceived he was not he knew exactly what he was doing because there was no falling nature in him are we together so while the brother gave us an example he says the breath breathed into the nostrils spiritually of adam and he became a living soul that you know the pentecostal or the true pentecostal church is born by the breath of god so what is he saying here he's saying what god did to adam was the same thing god did in the upper room what he did to adam is the same thing he did on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost came down praise the lord that is the reason why those men and women that were afraid of the jewish council and they were hiding themselves when the holy ghost came down brother balaam says uh peter took a soapbox and he stood on there and he said repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and he was no longer afraid why because the breath of god [Music] has blown away the fear blown away the doubt are we together you know the pentecost of the true pentecostal church is born by the breath of god he says let me let me read to you and see whether the church is born by the breath of god or net like adam was in the beginning praise the lord so he goes back and he takes uh praise the lord he goes back and he takes okay i did something here now that would be uh saint john let's go to the book of sin john i kind of wrongly wrote mine mine now are we together praise the lord amen what a wonderful jesus we serve glory be to god hallelujah um now sin john chapter 20 that was what he was referring to you can pick that up uh uh in the message there when you study you see the black female's name listening to that you see him referring to death it's in john chapter 20. praise the lord amen now so in john chapter 20 when you read from uh from verse 19. the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut the disciples where the disciples were those were shot where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews that's what i was saying or these men they were afraid because now jesus was was you know was taken away from them you know because of the fear of the jews they were they were all the same year jesus came and stood in the mess and said unto them peace be unto you and when he has so said he show himself his hand and his side then where the disciples glide when they saw the lord then said jesus unto them peace be unto you as my father have sent me even so sent are you and when he have said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost praise the lord amen he said receive yeah the holy ghost and uh there's something that just that just uh that just came to my mind that should be in john chapter 7. if you want to go there with me uh that's that would be c john chapter seven it's in john chapter 7 uh verse 38. praise the lord the bible says verse 37 in the in in the last day that great death of the feast jesus 2 and cry saying if any mentors let he come unto me and drink he the believer me as the scripture have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but does he speak but they speak he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified now so yeah jesus is speaking of the holy ghost and saying if you believe in me out of out of your belly will flow rivers of water praise the lord now but john is helping us to realize that when he made that statement he was referring to the holy ghost now in a simple sense he was the embodiment of the holy ghost all that was in god was in christ so until he leave he cannot release god to the people are we together now so but here he said he's making reference to the to the holy ghost that they were going to receive so and even here the bible says that he said as the scripture have said so there are shadows in the old testament that we will look at a little bit here there are shadows in the old testament that was that was making emphasis of how important the holy ghost is praise the lord now the bible says that jesus make reference to that the holy spirit that is she received because jesus was not yet glorified but over here is in john chapter 20 he has already resurrected he has already ascended to the father for a witness and he has come back you remember when mary saw it he said touch me i'm not a senator don't touch me i'm not a senator to the father yet he went to the father present the sacrifice to the father he came back so now he's glorified because he's even walking through the wall the bible says the doors were shot praise the lord he never needed a key praise the lord he never needed a key or the password brother jordan to enter that door he never needed a password he just came right through the wall and he said peace be unto you praise the lord now the holy ghost that he made reference to during his ethnic ministry because he was not yet glorified now he's coming back to that subject and the bible said he said peace be unto you and he breathed upon them and said receive ye the holy ghost praise the lord are we together amen now so uh uh i mean that there are a lot of things we can say on that but uh it will take much of our time tonight i'm just trying to drag into this thing of of an inspiration because you realize here jesus in one sense is prophesying to the believers in one sense uh uh uh uh he's securing them he's putting them under his word receive year the holy ghost we know that it will it would take uh uh uh it would take a couple of days uh or 10 days later before they will receive the holy ghost praise the lord amen after his ascension it would take 10 days before they would receive the holy ghost but yeah he's prophesying over them and and moreover the scripture is making it in a way for us to be able to grab the picture the bible says he breathed on them praise the lord glory be to god amen i mean if you were in that service and he breathed there is no way you can get the holy ghost [Laughter] even if you don't want the holy ghost you will get it because you've got a touch of his breath and but that's the same way when the word of god is preached because the word of god is the breath of god praise the lord now so uh uh the bible says he breathed on them and he says receive year the holy ghost so brother branham was referring to that he says let me read something here that was saint john chapter 20 that he was reading he says and and see whether the church is born by the breath of god or not like adam was in the beginning he said watch how do you get in the church he said born by what the breath of god breathe on me breathe on me spirit of the living god breathe on me that's my prayer tonight amen is that your prayer amen praise the lord just let the holy spirit breathe all mine for the breath of god what it is seal away into the kingdom of god praise the lord so he brings the birth the breath of god and tie it to the seal uh efficient full teddy creed now the holy ghost whereby ye are sealed you see is the breath of god that seal us away into the kingdom of god are we together now let's go now to a second timothy let's let's study that a little bit uh i'm almost out of my time here i get eight minutes to do this i don't trust myself praise the lord now when you come over to to uh uh second timothy chapter three there is something here this this is a very is a very wonderful instruction by the apostle paul now you have to know that paul was a very learned man in the torah you know he knew the torah which was the the the the old testament the old testament books so uh paul using this statement that every scripture is given by inspiration it is not just an oversized statement it is not because he had ran out of something to say amen he knew exactly that every scripture every verse in the bible is the breath of god that's why the bible says if you take one your name will be blotted out you can add to it you can take from it praise the lord amen and also you can take it lightly because it's the breath of god brother branham describe it like this he says it is almost like we are walking over a cousin and that custom will be hell and the only stream that we have to walk from time to intensity over this costume is the word of god that's the only thing that is holding us from sinking deep praise lord now if you if you realize that your life depends on that you have to take it serious you have to take it serious you have to take every word of god serious god meant what he says because he says what he means so uh paul says here all scripture i give him by inspiration and it's profitable for doctrine what does that means our scripture is given by inspiration and is profitable for doctrine what is doctrine in a simple biblical sense doctrine is what is right so the scripture like brother branham will come and tell us a phrase in this way cod condor order and doctrine the doctrine is what is right the things that we must stand for so paul is saying that all scripture is giving it's profitable if you stand with all scripture you will stand and and do and live with what is right amen all scripture is profitable for doctrine for reproof what is reproof reprove is what is not right while doctrine is what is right reprove is what is not right so all scripture is profitable to be able to show us what is not right and as much as show us what is right it also point out to us what is not right all scripture is given by inspiration and is profitable for correction how to get it right how to get it right brother branham says the word of god for every age will correct the error of the age he says the word will correct the error all the time even though jesus was just a 12 year old boy but when mary said what you were not supposed to say the word corrected the error so it's profitable for correction that's the only way you can enjoy the word if you are open up for correction because the world is profitable for correction praise the law it's not your school but where you just said it to pass you are not really interested in the subject but you just scrum so you can make the great no that's not the word of god praise the lord is profitable for doctrine what is right for reprove what is not right for correction how to get it right and for instruction how to stay right praise the lord how to stay right amen for you to know what is right and what is not right and then how to get it right and then how to stay right that's what this book is giving for it's the birth of god are we together now brother brennan preached a message uh a spiritual inspiration and in that message he read from ii kings chapter four it's strange enough he read ii king chapter 4 verse 30. it sounded to me like ephesians 4 30. but let's leave it like that now so in in in this message brother brown was talking about a shimmy knight woman he was he was trying now to help us to to understand spiritual inspiration he was talking about a shimano woman this woman that was living in her little town and she never had a child she i mean she she tried everything to have a child she never had a child so uh while she lived there i mean she was she was at peace with everybody i mean she had got over the worried of having a child and she was just happy and they said well maybe the law didn't you know and and then she realized elisha coming back and uh and she told her husband i think that is the holy man of god you know let's let's make a place for him you know let's let's let's find somewhere for him to rest up i always see him passing here when he passes he's always wiping his ball head and all of that let's just allow him to come in and rest in a little and and something like that and uh and and now now grab this now grab this that is a thought that came to her mind amen that is a thought that came to her mind that she went to tell her husband but little would she know that that was a breath of god god took a deep breath and she received it as an inspiration and she went and told her husband you know i it just it just i just i just feel like we should find a place praise the lord and uh uh uh and you know the story there that how you know the the god elijah the place he will come and rest they will feed him you know you sleep good and eat good and and one time he told his his uh his seven years out and says uh uh let me go and ask these people what do you want i mean it's just been so nice to us i just feel that i should bless them call the woman she says i'm fine we are okay you know my husband and myself we are we are doing okay you know uh i mean not really doing it for the game so you can see there it was a breath of god but little did she knew that god was so concerned about his prophet tracking hundreds of minds and he just took a deep breath and a woman capturing praise the lord and yes the bible says and gereza told his uh his master and says but i realize there is no there is no child making noise in this house i look all on the water i don't see no child photo praise the lord and there the the the god of creation gave them a promise by this time amen by this time and we know the story now but see how the whole thing is playing out here see the whole thing because i i mean you you grab the top there you see you appreciate what brother branham was speaking in that message now we know after time you know the the the woman you know enjoyed the baby and the baby growled and we we realized the boy passed away amen and this woman never stewie in the community and says y'all see how the pastor then can lie that they like to bring problems on people or you know all these uh i mean this this this whole message is just a fake and and you know she never did that she never did that the death of her son never changed her attitude to the prophet praise the lord she took her hearts got on it and you know got down the road to go and find where the man of god is and as she was going out of the the compound and and people would greet her she says all is well always well praise the lord let me tell you if you are frustrated and angry there is no way you can say all as well if you have a bad attitude and people ask you how are you there is no way you can say all is well because those two things do not match all as well is coming from a peaceful and a relaxed spirit if you are angry in you you can't say all as well i challenge you try it a challenge you try you will see how much hypocrite you are praise the lord but she got down there to the prophet and she told the prophet everything now bring the prophet now in into her house you know uh uh uh uh elijah sent his staff and the woman says i will not leave you as long as your soul levitt praise the lord and later on the prophet when brother branham says the prophet was a little bit troubled because god didn't give him a vision god never told him anything that this thing was going to happen so he went down there but see what happened when he got into the room he took the little child and what he did he did exactly what god did to adam in genesis 1. he laid his head upon his head and nose upon the nose mouth upon the mouth and he breathed into the child because what was that inspiration because inspiration is the breath of god praise the lord amen you see and and that is the thing that makes the church live when the word of god come out of the pages when you can just be fried in the egg and the scripture gets out of the page to your mind it makes your morning better when you can be driving in your car and and a scripture can just come to your mind and make you to be nice to the other drivers on the road that's that's the thing that brings life to the christian it's not just keeping the book under your arm but the book coming alive the words coming out of the pages of the book praise the lord i've passed my eight minutes i've gone eight minutes past my eight minutes but branham says here sea of distributors say he said let the breath of god fall fresh into their hearts and let them know that time is running out oh if there is ever a time where the word of god must come life to us or the word of god i mean we have got our minds so so uh uh you know contaminated with all the era we pick error from here we pick error from there we pick air of them so everything just looks like error and just like i said that is the thing that is killing the fight in us we don't have nothing in us to fight because let me tell you if you don't stand for anything you will fall for everything you will fall for everything every lie that is said in the name of brother branham you will fall for it every lie that is said in the name of the scripture you will fall for it because people come and say things that you can you don't even find on tape but ram says let the breath of god fall fresh into their hearts and let them know that time is running out we are just a little while longer to be here then we are going to be with him who we love and may now his presence bring healing to everyone
