Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be back home. We thank the Lord for keeping us while we were away from one another and uh and thank the Lord also for all the services you had brother speaking on the ministry of intercession and brother Dan also we just thank the Lord for that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord kind of forgive us a wonderful trip tonight. We will bring a little report to you u uh Sunday. Brother Tim Sean from Ghana will will be flying in from Canada on Friday. So we will have him speak to us. So we will we will just use tonight to report a little bit on our trip and then uh uh and then we we share something with you. Praise the Lord. So uh if uh the the the technicians can help us uh I really don't have things in proper order. So whatever the show I will be able to just comment on it a little bit but we we uh went over to Zimbabwe like we said we are going to uh uh be with brother Joseph and his church there on the uh church dedication. So, brother Joseph Chosi, he preached for us. I think uh was that in April or March this year uh when those brothers came down from uh Iowa. So, the brother that preached for us that Saturday night and Sunday morning, he he's the one there that is the the senior pastor. If if there is anything like that in the message, what actually it is is that brother brother Chikosi works like an apostle. that would be the right kind of a term to use because uh uh he was able to establish churches and uh so uh he started a church in his hometown Mutari that where he started from and then uh he moved over to Harari which is the capital and started this church that we that he just built and dedicated and then uh uh after then uh now he's over in the UK where he's pastoring a local assembly there. So UK will be where he's pastoring and the other churches he's overseeing it because they have their local pastor but uh since he was the one that started the work there so they kind of uh work alongside with him and uh so uh so that's if we can use the word senior pastor but a man only be a pastor of one church and and he can oversee other churches. That is the right way it should be. So uh uh we were we were there with them on their church dedication. I was trying to put uh uh just some few photos together and uh I did some copy and paste video because the the services were so long. It was such a marathon. Amen. Such a marathon. Uh from Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So uh uh and then uh Friday was a kind of a welcome uh service. So we have one service in the evening and then uh the marathon started from Saturday morning. we had two services and uh and then Saturday also was the the dedication of the church. Uh so uh we had a um services started around 8:00 in the morning. So uh there there's a preacher that will come in the morning preach but before then another preacher would come for maybe about some 50 minutes greet the people because there were just a lot of ministers. So he was trying to give every minister an opportunity. So he' be a forer come take 20 minutes or so. Uh uh then the main preacher comes and then after that we get back to singing then another forrunner comes then another preacher comes. So after that before we go on break then we come back again for two for another two service in the evening. So praise the lord and uh so that just that just how it was Sunday the same thing repeated uh the same order Sunday the same order on Monday. Saturday was a little bit different because we had a very long session because we had to do the preaching and then we go and do the dedication of the church and uh and then before we get to the evening service. So the evening service we play uh a message of brother Brandon which of course I might just show you a little video on Sunday. I was not able to pull that one out, but u uh so Emmanuel, if you have uh any picture that you want to show us, if you can cut that light off uh or deem it uh back there and let's see if pictures will work. If it don't work tonight, then we'll do it on Saturday. Okay, this one is a first follow. This will be uh uh uh South Africa. That's brother Ruben Daniels and his wife Sister Wendy Daniels. Uh I got to know them. U this is will be 21 years. Brother Rubin was a deacon at the time. Uh honor his brother, brother Joe Daniels was the pastor of the church. So uh that was my first visit to South Africa. Uh uh when we came back to Johannesburg uh they they hosted us. I was actually in their house. I in their house uh 21 years ago. And just then their son uh uh the next photo of the same uh no the next photo with the same people. Okay, that's the young man there. That's uh Delton. He was getting married that year. And this this was uh this is my host, Brother Vusi. Uh the pastor there in Suetto. He was here with us many years ago and uh uh so he was the one that I actually stopped over to see but wife was not well she's not been well so uh uh and we've been praying for her. So that was one of my major reason of going to South Africa. I wanted to see his wife his wife and uh children just like family to us. So that was the reason why I make a stop in in uh South Africa. But I didn't know that he too had a different plan for me. I'll tell you about it later. But brother brother Ruby Daniels also was not well. Now uh uh the past few years there were lot of uh uh prominent preachers in South Africa that went to be with the Lord. Brother George Martins, brother Gideon Retie and the lot lot of the prominent ministers. So when we heard that brother Ruby was not well, it was really really concerning. been praying for him and uh so I thought also that we would stop and visit with him and uh uh uh and brother Ruben he came down with uh pancreatic cancer and uh and and that was uh that was actually the cancer that brother Steve Chambi passed away from. It was pancreatic cancer. According to medical science, that is one of the the toughest cancer to detect and the moment you find it is gone. You are gone. In most cases, in most cases, the moment pancreatic cancer is discovered, it is already in its full stage and you are gone. The moment we got to know that brother Steve Jambbei had pancreatic cancer, it was already stage four. So with brother Ruben uh by the grace of God the I mean they never had any hope for him and uh uh but by the grace of God he stay with us. So we want to thank the Lord for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they had to go in and and do some some work and uh uh uh uh cut some of his tissues uh within. And we believe that the Lord can be able to uh regrow that. Amen. Or give him a brand new organ. &gt;&gt; So we thank the Lord for that. So that's that part of our South African trip. Let's go to the next one. Bring the church building. Okay. This was the church that we that we went to to dedicate there with brother uh Joe Danas and uh uh Bible believers Harari. That's that's the tabernacle name. So, uh uh yeah, that's that's the church building. The next one, if we go fast with that and uh and and Okay, this one looks like a video. Which one is that? Which one is that? Let's see. [Music] It looks like it does not have anything. Take that one away. Bring another one. That's my production. That's my production. I don't know. This this one should be the last one. That's that that's that's my service. I took the last service. So, uh uh yeah, I was trying to just skip through. I hope I I put try another one again. Or the pictures of uh Oh yeah. So these are just videos that I added. Uh Emmanuel, I see. Okay. So everything that come true. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, maybe there were just a lot of images to send at once and uh okay, we will we will work on the rest of uh the the pictures because uh uh even though the church building was where we went to do the dedication, but we did not have the service in the in the church building. We had a service on a tent because uh uh the the crowd was more than the building could hold. Uh the building I think is made to be able to hold close to a thousand people and we had about four to 5,000 people. &gt;&gt; So they had to put a huge tent outside. I thought I thought I put a photo of that one there but maybe it never came through. So we will try to correct it on Sunday. And then also there is a little portion of video also of uh you know the the the dedication you know when they when they were doing the the dedication of uh the building itself. So u uh yeah when they were doing the dedication of the building itself. So u I a picture of that there. So yeah, we we went through that and uh like you saw the last service that was the last day on Tuesday. So we preach in the morning and then a brother from u Uganda, brother Gideon, he he took uh the last uh exitation in the evening and then uh uh we went over to South Africa like I said to see brother wife and and u and just to see how they were doing and he's been a good friend to us too uh uh for for many about almost the same. I met them the same about 21 years. So, we got there and then we preached for brother uh brother David Gonzalez on Thursday. We got there on Thursday, got home and and just got ready for service that evening, visited brother David Gonzalez and we preached for him Friday. Uh I think uh Okay, I think that was the short video that went through. Maybe the image never came. Uh they lost a family in their in their church uh there. So they were having uh how we would call it like a gathering in the evening. So what normally they do is they uh they will meet every evening at the family house and they will have service the entire week and then on the weekend they would do a funeral. So something that is very very common among them. They will have service all through the week and then on the weekend they have uh the burial. So uh uh the Thursday night brother Vy went there and then I was uh preaching for brother David. So Friday he said let's go let's go and sympathize with the people. So well but because I know my friend because I know my friend you know he's a man of very few words. He don't talk a whole lot you know so I said well okay since I know this guy let me just prepare myself for the better and for the worse. And as soon as we were getting there, he says, "Well, you speak to the people this evening because I know my friend." So I prepare myself for the dead in the wor. So So yeah, so we had to preach that night to the people. Praise the Lord. And speaking that night, uh uh there was something I I I said during the service and then after it kind of it stuck on my mind. So a little bit of that is what I was I will speak on tonight by God's grace. So then Saturday uh uh um he drove me into uh Sukunda. It's about uh an hour a little over an hour drive out of Johannesburg. Uh that's another church that he oversee for for a couple of years because the pastor passed away in a car accident uh I think couple of years ago. So he overseed that church until devoted a brother as a pastor. So uh uh so he took me there um and uh we had service there Saturday uh two services Saturday morning and Saturday evening and then we came back to Johannesburg to his church in Suetto. Uh and we have service for them Sunday evening and Sunday morning and Sunday evening. So u uh yeah so it was it was it was a unplanned busy trip but uh by the grace of God we survived and we are back home. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank the Lord that uh he was able to to bless our trip. Thank you for your prayers. Uh it really was a blessing to know that uh there were people that were watching our back. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, let's just sing this little chorus and then uh we will we will go to the Lord in prayer and then read something out of God's word. I I just uh you know this the habit of taking pictures during service is I I feel so odd, you know. So, it's hard for me to to just be taking pictures, you know, during service. So most of my pictures I I had to come out of the service, go outside. So I don't have good pictures. I really don't have good pictures. But so I was trying to sleep between the videos and do short pictures doing the video. That's what I was working on this afternoon. By God's grace, we came in early this morning. So I was able to get some sleep. And uh uh there's a little song uh uh and uh uh the song says uh uh I don't regret every mile that I travel for the Lord. [Music] If we have the verse of the [Music] I don't regret. [Music] Let's start it again. I don't regret am I travel for the Lord and I don't regret a time I trusted in his word. have seen the years go by. May the days without a song, but I don't regret a mile. I've traveled for the Lord. Oh, I don't regret a mile that I travel for. Let's stand on our feet now. And I don't regret the time I trusted in his word. I've seen a year go by many days without a song. I don't regret a mile that I travel for the Lord. Oh, I don't regret that I travel for the Lord. I thought regret time I had trusted in his word. Stay in the year go by. Many days we found a song. But I don't regret a mark that I drove for the Lord. You know, I I was thinking about this song not only because of uh because of a trick or because of the trick that I made, but you think about it also. Every one of us here, we have to drive set in mind to come to church. I was listening to the service last Wednesday there where Dan was testifying, you know, uh uh coming driving over here to Brooklyn Center and I was just thinking I came from service that night. I was just lying down and u uh thinking about death and uh that's when I started thinking about this song you know uh uh to know that uh every one of us we have to drive some to come here and it's because of is because of the Lord. It might not look like uh traveling to Ohio or traveling to Florida for service. It might not look like going overseas, but I want for us to realize tonight, you know, just like how companies will pay their workers that travel that put mileage on their vehicle. And I believe that's the same way like David said, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not his benefits. We put mileage on our vehicles. We put mileage on our body to come and serve the Lord. Some of you come from working. Try to grab some rest and get yourself ready for church. It is more than a duty. It's a love affair. [Music] We have no regret to be in the house of the Lord tonight. [Music] Because if a man can pay their workers for putting mileage on their car, the Lord can bless the parts of your vehicles. [Music] The Lord can bless, [Music] keep you safe on the road, keep you and your family safe. So, let's sing that song a little one more time again to know that it's not just only because I travel, but it's concerning every one of us. We should have no regret. We should have no regret for every time that we have to go to serve the Lord. David said, "I was glad when he said unto me, let's go into the house of the Lord." I think about uh Brother Wesley and Sister Karen. I heard they were way in service. think about them all the time driving and uh Jordan and his wife come down from St. CL is now birth and his family and uh brother Hillary his family come from Shak [Music] I mean every one of us we have to drive some about 15 20 minutes to get to church I don't regret my that I travel for the Lord Oh. Oh. I don't regret every time I've trusted in his word. I've seen the years go by. Many days we found our song. Oh, I don't regret [Music] that I travel far. Oh, I don't regret that I travel for my Lord. I don't regret every time that I trusted in this world. I see the year go by many days without a song. Oh, I don't regret a yes that I travel for. Let's sing that one more time now. Oh, I don't regret a mile that I travel for the Lord. Oh, let me never let me never regret a time. But I trusting in your word. Oh, I sing the year go by many without a song. Oh, I don't regret am I travel for. Let's pray together tonight. Let's just thank the Lord for giving us this opportunity to be in the house of the Lord. And let's thank him for his goodness, his love, and his mercy. Let's thank him that he will he will make his presence a joy to our hearts. There will be no regret to be in the house of the Lord. David said, "I was glad when he said unto me, let's go into the house of the Lord." Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you tonight, oh God. Oh, Father God, I see the year go by, Father.

[Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you. Thank you, brother Ariel. Sister Joy, thank you. Praise the Lord. Amen. The Lord bless you. Let's take our Bibles tonight and uh Second King chapter 4. Second Kings chapter 4. That's where we want to just encourage you tonight. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know most of the time I say we we having a prayer meeting you know um uh most of the time the children told tell me at home daddy I thought you say it was a prayer meeting and uh so and then you end up preaching you know uh uh but that's what a prayer meeting is you know a service is not complete without the preaching of the word amen And every every service must be a prayer meeting where we take uh requests to the Lord. And uh I've always believed that the proof that you have a good prayer life is the time you spend in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; You spend much time in praying, you spend much time in the word. Uh second king chapter 4 tonight, let's read from verse one. Now there cry a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophet unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead. This was a widow. Praise the Lord. There a lot of widows that sat under Elijah ministry and this is not one year. Uh uh uh thy servant, my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord, and the creditors is come to take unto him my two sons to be a bound man. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you remember under under the law of uh uh the jubilee under the jubilee in Exodus when the person was indeped you can't pay your debt then sometimes you have to give your son and and then they will have to go and work until the time of the jubilee before they go free. So it's a kind of a situation here we are seeing with this widow. uh the husband borrowed some money he couldn't paid. Now he's gone and uh and the creditors want to come and take her sons to be bound men. And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only telling me the problem, but what do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What do you want the Lord to do? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometime we spend much time talking the problem than really giving our request. So Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what have thou in the house?" And she said, "Thy may have not anything in the house save a pot of oil." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he said, "Go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels. Borrow not a few." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She said, "I only have a pot of oil." So the prophet say, "Okay, then go uh uh then you know just go go to all your neighbors and borrow vessels, gallon drums, anything that can carry." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Anything that can carry, go and borrow, but borrow not a few. That's what I want us to to be able to to remember. Amen. &gt;&gt; Borrow not a few. Borrow as much as you can. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't put limits on God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't put limits on God. Don't be afraid. God is in control. &gt;&gt; And when thou I come in, thou shall shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and thou shall set aside that which is for. Now she says she only she only have a pot of oil. And here is the prophet is telling her to go and borrow vessels. When you come, go in the room, you and your sons, take one of the vessel, carry it there. Don't bring it out until it is full. When you bring it out, carry the other one there. It should be full before you bring it out. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. She only have a pot of oil. Now, where where is the rest of the oil coming from? &gt;&gt; God is still Jehovah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still the provider. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; He stay He knows our needs and and and he's the one the same God that was able to provide a lamb on the hill for Abraham. He's the same God that is going to fill that barrel over and over again. You remember the brother testimony I told you last year from South Africa uh the farmer uh brother Shauna on on the milk farm. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh uh uh uh and the boy he bought one one gallon. You know, the uh uh uh the farmer told him that uh you know, there was no milk there. Took that gallon and then he was able to get gallons and gallons and gallons of milk to be able to fill. He's the same God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These things are not makeup stories. They are things that are happening in the life of God's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, things that are happening in the life of God, children. And when thou I come in, thou shall shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shall pour oil into all those vessels, and thou shall set aside that which is full. So she went from him and shut the door upon her and and upon her sons who brought the the vessels to her and she pou. And it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son, "Bring me yet a vessel," which means she had more, praise the Lord, she had more oil left than the vessels that could carry them. Amen. &gt;&gt; She said, "Bring me yet a vessel." And he said unto her, "There is not a vessel more, and the oil is still." Amen. &gt;&gt; Then then she came and told the man of God, and he said, "Go sell the oil and pay thy debts and leave thou and thy children off the rest." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is there anyone in debt tonight just like myself? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is there any deptor in the house tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same God that took care of this debt can take care of your debt. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What? It looks like I strike the cord. &gt;&gt; Huh? Those those were the people that were that were behind David. Don't worry, I'm just starting. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, y gave me the reason to preach on debts. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's pray together tonight. Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you. We want to appreciate you, Lord, and give you praise and glory. It's good to be back home, Lord. This is where, Father, Lord God, we can call home. This is where we find the liberty to preach the things on our hearts, people of God. Father Lord of Black Pressure faith and a body that we are part of Lord God and people that we growing together with and Lord Jesus they are bearing with us. We are bearing with them and we all are trusting you that you will bring us through. We love you and we appreciate you tonight in Jesus name. Amen. The Lord bless you. You can have your seat. Let's talk about this depth. Then I think I'm going to change my my message tonight and talk about the debtor. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says when when David came when David came to Jerusalem and after the death of Saul and all the people that were running behind him, you know, all the people that were running his campaign, they were all debtors. They said those that that were in depths and those that were in problems and you know those are the people running beyond David. &gt;&gt; David we vote for you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But tonight I want to speak on borrow borrow the vessels and borrow not a few. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to speak on borrow the vessels. Like I said, I was preaching to those people that night and uh uh uh uh it was kind of outside outside of the house. They just have a little tent before the house and and uh I was speaking to them and uh and I spoke on something, you know, uh uh out out of inspiration, but uh uh there was something that I spoke on that and it it meant something to me and I I thought about it as well. I I know I've spoken on this before, but not in the direction that I spoke on it. So, that's what I want to talk about tonight. Praise the Lord. Matthew chapter 5. Amen. Matthew chapter 5. uh uh Jesus will say here uh Matthew chapter 5 verse42 he says give to him that ask thee and from him and from him that will borrow of thee turn not thou away praise the Lord &gt;&gt; turn not thou away now if you look if you look into this subject I'm not going to do on uh on on uh uh boring the deaths tonight. But where my mind is tonight uh uh that I want us to pay attention on is that every one of us that are serving the Lord, we are borrow vessels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us, &gt;&gt; if you uh if you are serving the Lord and you want the Lord to to make the best of you, you got to borrow him your vessel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's where my thought is tonight. Praise the Lord. The Lord will take care of our debts. He will help us to pay them &gt;&gt; and uh because we we must pay them. And uh but tonight we just we want to talk more in a sense of uh uh uh uh being uh uh a borrow vessel to God. Being a borrow vessel to God. And this was the thought that struck me because when I was talking I told the people our Lord Jesus from the womb to the grave everything he had he borrowed. He borrowed the womb he had to be born in. He borrowed the grave. He had to be buried. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you see, the Lord Jesus, he's uh he's this he's this uh uh uh uh he's this debtor or he's this he's this man that borrows. When whenever he borrows something from you, when he return it back to you is better. &gt;&gt; He give it back to you better. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He give it back to you better. If you if you read the Lord, you read the Lord of God is the the the Lord of God. And when God h in in the book of Exodus and and God told the children of Israel, you know, if your brother borrow from you, you must never add an interest on it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That was the law of God. You were not supposed to add an interest. When the son of Israel borrow from one another, they must not add an interest. God is saying that I, you know, I I I bless you. So if you are helping another man, don't don't put don't put charges over his head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's able to pay you back, just take what he gives to you. &gt;&gt; That's that's the Lord of God. &gt;&gt; It's written right there in the scripture. Yes. &gt;&gt; But Y said here with our Lord Jesus, you know, uh uh it is not that he's paying you interest, but it is in a place of word uh uh uh uh in one sense he's appreciating you giving you know giving him whatever vessel you give him. In a message of perfect strength by perfect weakness. Brother Brham talks about this woman. He says, "One had just a a vessel with a little oil in it." That's the woman we read about tonight. She had nothing. Her two sons was going to be sold for bounding. She had nothing else she could do with this little vessel of oil. Wasn't very much. She was at the end. Elijah Elisha said to her said, "What have what have you got in your house?" Amen. Just like God telling Moses, "What is in your hands?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always come and use the little that we have. &gt;&gt; If we are ready to give it to him, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Most of the time, uh the problem is that we are afraid. We think that uh we can take care of ourself better than God can. &gt;&gt; It's it's a it's an unconscious fear that we have. &gt;&gt; It's an unconscious fear. &gt;&gt; Elijah told the other widow woman, she said, "It's the last it's the last flower that I have." He said, "Okay, bake me a cake first." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the Lord likes to strike that God call when it looks like it is the last that you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you trust him with your last? &gt;&gt; Can you trust God with your last birth? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A sign that you can trust him with your last birth is to trust him with your first breath in the morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you can't give God your first breath in the morning, what proof you can give him the last one? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like a man said, if you have a dollar and you can't pay, you can't take 10 cents out of that, not a million dollar you will be able to take money from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you cannot take h 10 cents from out of a dollar or $10 from out of a hundred, it's not when God gave you a million dollar that you coming to be us at church. &gt;&gt; Stop joking. Stop lying to yourself in your mind. The proof that we can trust God with our last birth is that we can give him the first one in the morning. When we wake up and we see our heartbeating and we say, "Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be your name." &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know what the day holds, but I'm committing myself in your hands. I want to worship you. I want to praise you. &gt;&gt; That's a proof that you can give him your last birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Most people will want to give him their last birth because they don't want to die. They want him to save them. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But yeah, here I said that we see here we we see a constant order in the scripture where where where God the prophet Elijah is demanding the last of these people. What you have lady, your sons are going to be the bomb and they're going to take them away from you. They're going to work in the field until the the the jubilee year. It's a jubilee year before they will come. They will come back. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that's what we want to talk about this this evening. You know, borrow vessels. Borrow vessels and borrow not a few. When you are borrowing, you should borrow much. You remember the other the other king where the prophet told says uh uh uh uh uh take a ball and smite it and what he did he strike three times. The prophet says oh my god how foolish this man is. You have the opportunity to be able to strike as many times which mean how many times you strike that's that's how many victory you have over the enemy. So only three times he was able to beat the Syrians because he went to strike three times. So God Elijah is telling the woman borrow don't borrow a few. You see because the human mind because of our fear we always putting limit on God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We always putting limit on God. It's it's a it's a it's a subconscious think that comes from the fallen nature. Man, we are believing God. We are believing God. And you know that that h with God all things are possible. He can do you know but back in our mind you know the the the the the reason is that when man fell when we fell what we call the fall we fell from our soul to our body. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to remember that before you became this flesh with get get five senses you were you were you were internal with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you see that's where redemption is bringing us back to that's where the message of the hour is bringing us back to the consciousness of serving God from the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What God want, he wants the consciousness of uh of his spirit in our soul to control this body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not this body detecting to our soul, but your soul detecting to this body. &gt;&gt; When the body says, "I'm tired," the soul say, "Get up. Carry me into church. &gt;&gt; Get up. Carry me into work." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The soul detecting or overtaking the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where he's bringing us to &gt;&gt; because we have that sense of fear. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have the Holy Ghost. Yes. But let something happen. &gt;&gt; You realize out of a certain before you come to consciousness to start exercising your faith, the first thing that grab you is fear. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The the the reason is because there is there is much of us in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is much of us in the flesh. I heard one old man saying something. I I say I says, "Man, I he said it right." You know what he said? He says he said, "Lion, lion can only eat flesh." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said lion does not eat fruits. &gt;&gt; Lion can only eat flesh. He said so when you are in the flesh, the devil that is like a rolling lion. &gt;&gt; Oh man, he can chew you up. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are in the flesh. &gt;&gt; He says, "But if you are producing the fruit of the spirit, the the lion will never get you because he don't eat fruits. He only eat flesh." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So that's that's what we're trying to talk about here tonight. &gt;&gt; You see? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see uh uh uh if you if you just think about it, Almighty God, the creator of the universe, the creator of the universe when he was coming to become our kinsman redeemer, he got that young girl uh h about 18 years old, 18 and 20 years old. She's at a place where she having all of these plans in her mind like all of our young young uh girls have. They want to get married. They want to have children, you know, to think about their future and all of that. But yet uh he came down and uh uh uh uh and says uh uh uh uh you know uh uh uh here Mary, you're going to have a child. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He borrow her womb. That was the thought that struck me. He borrowed her womb. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says one day he wanted to preach. He never had a pulpit. He had to borrow Peter's boat. Amen. &gt;&gt; But but before he borrowed that boat, Peter was just a disappointed future man that will fish the whole night and caught nothing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He fished the whole night. He caught nothing. But then uh Yer said that when Jesus uh uh uh borrow his boat, are we together? &gt;&gt; He said, "Yeah, we we have found him. Come and see." I can see the woman leaving they watching the men stop the ox in the field coming down to the bank of of of Galilee to listen to him. There was something different about him. He had he had authority from God. &gt;&gt; And after his speaking, he had borrow one of their boat which he was to use as a pulpit. &gt;&gt; A little old dead fish boat, the greatest pulpit. &gt;&gt; There there he spoke to the multitude. And after borrowing the boat, he said, "Trust out, Simon into the deep, let down for the drought." &gt;&gt; When he had fish the whole night and caught nothing, but was willing to borrow his boat to the master. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's a rewarder of them that diligently seeking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is nothing that you that you borrow to him it that that is a waste. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is nothing that you borrow to him that is a waste. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean h borrowed that young girl h a womb. Now the Catholic has even made her god. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Her name is a memorial that even the the the the Catholic Church has make her a deity. They call her the worship. They says, "Well, they got to call her name before they even call God." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's what happens when we borrow our life to the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to talk about this morning. Amen. God is a spirit. He's a spirit. I mean, I have a bunch of quotes here. I don't have time to read all them to you, but uh I mean, I want you to be able to grab the thought of where I'm going to tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a spirit and if he will do anything in time, he needs a vessel. Just like Elijah told that woman, go and get the vessel. He need a vessel that he can use. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just think about it. God borrowing your vessel to use it for 60 years and he giving you 1,000 years of millennium. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What kind of a benefit is that? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When people were useless their life in drinking and adultery and everything and and and and and when they die, that is the end. &gt;&gt; But he says, "You give me your youth. &gt;&gt; Borrow me your youth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I will give you 1,000 years &gt;&gt; and then when you come from there, I give you eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's not this kind of a neighbor that borrow your thing and then he's fought it. &gt;&gt; No, there is nothing he has ever borrow &gt;&gt; that he's fought. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Some some I mean some people h I mean they came from a worse past. They were in uh drinking. They were in drugs. They were womanizing and uh h prostitution. Whatever it is. But when they give their life over to him, he he he changed their life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As he borrowed their life, he changed it. He he makes them a a a respectable person in the neighborhood in in their in their workplaces. &gt;&gt; That is hard for people to even realize that this person had this past. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Borrow me your vessel. borrow me your vessel. In this generation that we are living in, God is looking for some vessel &gt;&gt; that he can just pour a little bit of oil in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't wanted to preach tonight, but you already get me preaching. that faith have saved thee. He didn't even have even have but one garment and borrow somebody grave to to lay in. Praise the Lord. The Bible says Joseph Amatia uh he his his grave was a brand new grave. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe uh when he told his family that he was giving his grave to Jesus, he says, "Well, I thought I thought I thought it was I thought it was it was your grave." He said, "Don't worry. He's just using it for three days." &gt;&gt; He's just using it for three days. &gt;&gt; Now, that's why he said, "Destroy this temple and in three days." &gt;&gt; So, he caught the revelation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's just borrowing it for three days. You will give it back. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you know what a feeling. What a feeling to know that the person that used this grave resurrected. &gt;&gt; What a feeling. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What a feeling. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just think about the the the man that borrowed Jesus the band to for I I I mean uh for him to see the shepherds coming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To worship and says angels. I believe he was said, "Oh my God, if I knew I would have given him a bedroom." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I would have given him a bedroom. Mama, we should have back out and put them in the bedroom. &gt;&gt; But yet he has something to give. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because there was no room in the in yet he had something to give. &gt;&gt; You think about it now. He gave his bag &gt;&gt; and shepherds angels came down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe the roof was laying one side. &gt;&gt; It was almost about to break. But because he borrow it &gt;&gt; for almighty God to be born. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Angels came down and visited. You don't give God anything.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't even have one garment but borrow somebody graves to be to lay in. Listen to brother Brandon now. I could have been pretty well off if I took all the money people have offered me. But I want to be just as poor as those who came to be prayed for. &gt;&gt; We We are fellow citizens of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that just to be saved. I'm saying it because I I want you to know friends that the kingdom of God does not consist in riches or fine clothes. &gt;&gt; It is sub submitted heart to God. &gt;&gt; Is where God works. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Submitted heart to God. Yeah. So heart you can have uh you you know good good things but the first thing there is the heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because uh when when when the heart is submitted to God &gt;&gt; and God is borrowing their heart then everything that you have he can sustain. &gt;&gt; Think about the people that walk in the in the wilderness 40 years even their clothes never get old. &gt;&gt; Why? Because his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because his presence was among you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't you know it's his presence that is sustaining your vehicle? &gt;&gt; Even though it might be old or whatever is going on with your vehicle, but I mean as you sit down in that vehicle and say, "Lord, just be with me now as I'm going out, you know, bless me."

If you borrow if you borrow some things and the the prophet says go and borrow B vessels. I mean, if there was one that was leaking, the woman will pull that oil back and chunk it away because it's leaking. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I want us. That's that's that's I mean that was that was the thing that struck my mind as I was going back. We were driving back to Johannesburg. Uh uh let's stay in Johannesburg, not driving back. I mean driving back to where we going. I was just thinking about that. I said, "Well, yeah, I never thought about it this way, but uh uh uh I'll give some thought to it. Every one of us, every one of us, we are all borrow vessels." Brother Abraham says uh as he borrowed this body to preach the gospel from and he borrowed your body to be sitting here tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. People to represent him in this age. &gt;&gt; People to to be able to stand for the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; People might not put the right context to it to say, "Well, that's a son of God or that's a daughter of God." All they can say is, "Well, that girl, she funny. She's strange." &gt;&gt; They might not be able to understand it because the the word is so corrupt. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God say you are just an oddball to them. That other girl, she very strange. You know that one, she like to dress like a old lady. That's why they might think. But if they will only know that your body has been borrowed for almighty God to be dwelling in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That there's a portion of God in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is the thing that is that is that is holding back the wrath of God because God have some borrowed body on earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be a borrow body tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same as he borrow your body to do the work that he want he want to do through you because he he is still Emmanuel a sign God with his people. God living among his people a super everlasting sign. I can never fail. It can never fail. Sorry. It can never fail. It will always be the sign. That's Emmanuel. God with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It was that Emmanuel. When he have borrow a womb, when he have borrow a grave, he borrow my eyes.

And sometimes we go we go an entire year and realize that uh uh I mean uh we are doing well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We might have some uh uh headache or or or tiredness here but the Lord has been taking good care of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's been taking good care of us. &gt;&gt; He's been watching over our glory. Why? because the h uh h uh h of this body has been borrowed to him. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when he finish using it, then he just he just get rid of it and then give you a brand new body. Amen. &gt;&gt; If this tabernacle be dissolved, there's another one waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Show us show us the father and it will suffice us. He says, "And I've always tried to to stay in a place. I don't I don't believe Christian ought to ask for uh the best that there is in the land. A Christian ought to be humble. I think that even even if if you could afford it, I I still think we ought to be an example." Amen. &gt;&gt; My Lord didn't even have a place to lay his head. The foxes have then the birds have nets. But he didn't he didn't even have a place to lay his head. Come to the word, borrow a manger to be born in. And yet said the Lord has blessed us with with homes. We have a roof over our head.

He don't have a physical body." The Bible says he made man in his image, out of the dust of the earth, you know. Uh uh and God stepped in that body right from Adam. That's why he made man so he can have a vessel. The Bible say we are made for his pleasure. &gt;&gt; So he can step down in us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But then how how much how much of how much of our body we give to him? How much are we conscious of it? Oh, if we if we just come to that place where uh uh uh we we would just we just allow him to use the the the uh you know the this body that he has borrowed.

We you know we we provide for this. I mean that's that's that just our how our mind works in the society that we live. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But take it take it take it to that uh uh uh uh the truth of the matter. If he's borrowing it, he takes care of it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please don't understand me tonight that brother say we must not pay insurance. That's not what I'm preaching tonight. Please don't understand me like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't don't take me to that level. I'm more in a place of uh God using our body for spiritual works.

No, he he's not up. He's he he don't want to be your neighbor where he says, "Hey, hey, my my my rag that I gave to you, don't break it home. I see the way you using it." Sometimes that's what we do to the Lord. It just Sunday, Wednesday, I'm tired. We must we must be able to to to to to to get a better understanding &gt;&gt; that this is the very creator of our body &gt;&gt; and if we give it to him he can keep us in perfect health. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we give it to him he can give us signal &gt;&gt; borrow a vessel and not a few. Praise the Lord. So God is borrowing vessel all over the world. Maybe if he's not using yours, it's because you you I mean you are taking it from you all the time. &gt;&gt; But there are others that are dedicating their vessel &gt;&gt; in prayer, in consecration, &gt;&gt; wanting to see God moving. Lord, use me to save somebody. &gt;&gt; Use me to draw somebody to you. Make me a testimony. They are committing their body because they want to be used by God. &gt;&gt; Lord, if I can just have the courage to invite somebody to church, &gt;&gt; I don't need to preach to them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The people that are always, you know, they they want to have an equal share of their vessel, they are the one that is complaining that God is not doing anything. But the ones that have given their vessel completely and every day they want to feel the effect of the master using their vessel, they always have a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Borrow that vessel. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, if we borrow our vessel, this church will be different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we really borrow our vessel to God and say, "Lord, let your name be raised in this place." &gt;&gt; Amen. this little fellowship will be different. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It will not just be a good shepherd fellowship and uh uh uh Lord, it would not just be a good sheep shepherd fellowship, but be a a fellowship where uh there will be that will be a a living h a a testimony and and and and manifestation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean, we would be so burdened that uh uh people would come and and say uh you know uh write a testimony as uh there's a young lady I saw at Walmart. I want us to pray for her. I don't you don't have to know her name. &gt;&gt; You don't have to know her name. But you are just burdening that when you see people you want to pray for them. I pass a young man on the street. I don't know what's wrong with him but I just want us to pray for him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because your vessel is turned over. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's so empty that it's look it want to be filled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are looking for B. You are looking for the need. &gt;&gt; How can we go the whole week if you don't have a burden to pray for somebody? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why we really don't have a prayer life &gt;&gt; because we are not burdening for people. The Lord has meet our needs. We fe we we we are we are at a little place of uh you know contentment. Lord, thank you for my family. Thank you for my wife and children. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. That's good.

So every day we must empty it. Empty it at the feet of the Lord. And then you go the next day, let God fill your vessel up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thinking about this brother, thinking about this other young man, thinking about this other person. &gt;&gt; Amen.

His whole youthfulness was taken away from him because he was a borrowed vessel. Samuel just a little boy also his youthful that was taken from him. He was because he was and and and and and by God's good they were able to grab it, understand it and appreciate it that they were doing something for God.

The God that delivered the lion, the God is more than able &gt;&gt; to give him every giant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that God can give us every giant. &gt;&gt; Dedicate our vessel in the hands of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Musicians come.
