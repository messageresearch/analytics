[0:27] knows all this though
[0:29] who is that fellow that said one time is
[0:31] not that the carpenter's son over here
[0:33] we know him or did he get this wisdom
[0:36] while we don't seem connected with any
[0:38] of our schools
[0:40] we don't know any books he ever learned
[0:41] from who is it he was the answer
[0:45] of the prophet's prophecy here he comes
[0:50] riding upon the fold of an ass
[0:53] what an attraction god was fulfilling
[0:56] his promised word the
[0:58] hour that had been waiting since 4 000
[1:01] years
[1:02] and genesis the third chapter and the
[1:06] 15th verse
[1:07] god had made the prediction the seed of
[1:10] the woman shall bruise the serpent's
[1:12] head
[1:13] but his head shall bruise her heel
[1:17] that prophecy down through the bible
[1:20] that had been predicted of this man
[1:22] coming
[1:23] here just recently
[1:26] there was a prophet who stood up among
[1:28] them that was vindicated the prophet
[1:31] zechariah and he said that
[1:34] you daughters of jerusalem and you
[1:37] daughters of zion
[1:38] rejoice shout
[1:42] scream out for your king comes to you
[1:47] meek and lowly and humble riding upon
[1:50] the fold of an ass
[1:52] and you're those people that read that
[1:54] scripture day by day
[1:56] watched him come riding in and cried who
[1:58] is this
[2:04] god fulfilling his word to the people
[2:07] that should
[2:08] have known what it was but they didn't
[2:09] know it
[2:12] when god fulfills his word it always
[2:14] causes an attraction
[2:17] always does causes an attraction
[2:22] for it is the unusual so unusual when he
[2:26] fulfills his word to the modern trend
[2:28] of the day
[2:32] because the moderate trend of they don't
[2:34] believe in it they
[2:36] had their own way now
[2:40] we see and let us go back in the
[2:43] scriptures
[2:44] and take some other unusual events
[2:48] just for a few more minutes
[2:51] when god fulfilled his prophecy when god
[2:55] says anything he's going to do it
[2:58] all heavens and earth will pass away but
[2:59] that word can never pass away
[3:02] so it usually causes a scene
[3:06] an unusual scene notice
[3:10] how ridiculous that the word of god to a
[3:15] a people who's supposed to believe it
[3:17] and yet it's so unusual they cry
[3:20] well what's this
[3:23] where'd you get that stuff who is this
[3:28] what is this when they ought to have
[3:30] been screaming
[3:31] hosanna to the king that cometh in the
[3:35] name of the lord
[3:36] but there's just a little group doing
[3:38] that
[3:40] just a little group of
[3:43] 4 000 years of prophecy
[3:46] for the greatest thing that could ever
[3:48] happen to the nation
[3:51] for all the hope of the dead rested upon
[3:54] it
[3:54] all the future laid in it and the
[3:57] religious people that claim they believe
[3:59] it was screaming out
[4:01] who is it what's this attraction
[4:05] something unusual
[4:08] about the same just don't change
[4:12] not unusual let's see some of the
[4:15] unusual things that have just said
[4:17] what was the attraction just before
[4:20] judgment struck the world
[4:22] and destroyed it by water an old man
[4:26] ran years old building a boat when there
[4:30] was no water to float it in
[4:34] up there for years standing in the door
[4:37] building away on the interior on the
[4:39] inside and pitching it
[4:41] inside and out say the world's going to
[4:42] be swallowed up with water
[4:45] the great scientific age what is that
[4:49] pounding up on the hill up there
[4:51] why is that old man by the name of noah
[4:55] and he's up there the old fanatic
[4:58] the old man stood in the sun too long
[5:01] his sunstroke
[5:02] is out of his mind and he's building
[5:06] what he calls an ark and saying the
[5:10] waters is coming from up there where
[5:12] there is no water
[5:13] and it's going to float all the people
[5:15] around and everybody that don't hear his
[5:17] message
[5:18] and everybody that won't come into that
[5:20] ark is going to be drowned
[5:23] did you ever hear such a thing it was an
[5:26] unusual
[5:27] attraction i imagine when the people
[5:30] wanted a good laugh
[5:31] they went up and stood before the ark
[5:33] door and laughed
[5:36] while you said it was going to rain a
[5:38] hundred years ago
[5:40] grandpa told me he heard you up here
[5:42] saying it's going to rain
[5:43] and you're still beating around on this
[5:44] old piece of wood up here
[5:47] why don't you get next to yourself but
[5:49] it was god
[5:53] get ready to confirm a promise and to
[5:56] fulfill a prophecy that is prophetically
[5:58] made
[5:59] very unusual god fulfilling his promise
[6:03] to noah
[6:04] while others was laughing god was also
[6:08] getting ready to make history
[6:11] to show to others even to this day
[6:15] that he keeps his word
[6:18] no matter how unreal it seems
[6:20] unreasonable he
[6:22] still keeps his word he was making an
[6:25] example out of that old man pounding on
[6:28] that ark
[6:29] for these people here in america tonight
[6:33] and all over the world no matter what
[6:35] science says what they say this that or
[6:37] the other

[6:41] history
[6:44] what was the attraction one day an
[6:47] unusual thing happened back in the
[6:49] wilderness
[6:52] and it was a bush that was on fire
[6:56] and a runaway prophet was standing down
[6:59] in the wilderness
[7:00] you never heard no voice never heard no
[7:04] sound but he looked and seen an
[7:07] unusual thing up on top of the mountain
[7:12] god was trying
[7:16] to attract his attention
[7:20] same is it today
[7:24] god was getting ready to fulfill
[7:27] his word by his prophet abraham
[7:31] your seed shall sojourn 400 years in a
[7:34] strange land i'll bring him out with a
[7:36] mighty hand
[7:38] and he was preparing a man
[7:42] for the job as he was preparing an
[7:45] ark or a safety place for all
[7:48] who would believe god
[7:52] put this bush on fire and this
[7:56] sheepherder moses said i
[7:59] will just turn aside to see what this
[8:02] strange thing means
[8:04] and when he got moses up to the bush
[8:08] he spoke to him what was the attraction
[8:12] later in the pilot's hall
[8:16] when this sheep herder joe down a stick
[8:21] and it turned into a serpent god
[8:25] fulfilling his promise to moses
[8:28] what was the attraction at the dead sea
[8:33] when pharaoh's horses was all astonished
[8:37] when they seen a wind come down from the
[8:39] heavens
[8:41] and parked the red sea from right to
[8:43] left
[8:44] i had a poor bunch of slaves walking in
[8:48] the duty of god
[8:49] walk across that on dry land
[8:53] what was it god keeping his word
[8:57] the deadness moved away a living people
[9:01] went across and a spiritually dead
[9:04] people tried to impersonate it
[9:06] and drowned god fulfilling prophecy
[9:12] and making history that was the traction
[9:15] at the dead sea what was the attraction
[9:18] this
[9:19] second day after that at mount sinai
[9:24] when all the people was command enough
[9:26] to come at their wives
[9:29] when they asked to wash your clothes and
[9:30] sanctify themselves
[9:32] and gather around the mountain
[9:36] where a man by the name of moses had
[9:39] said he met god
[9:40] and a pillar of fire and god had said to
[9:44] moses
[9:44] i'm going to come down amongst the
[9:46] people i'm going to confirm that
[9:49] what i told you and who i am
[9:52] i'm going to show them that i am that
[9:54] god
[9:56] that was attraction god
[9:59] fulfilling his word what was the
[10:02] attraction one day
[10:04] in history where a nation had forgot god
[10:08] where the people had become formal and
[10:11] indifferent were the priests that all
[10:14] went with the modern trend
[10:16] the prophets prophesied according to the
[10:18] will of the priest
[10:20] in that day as usual they had one man
[10:23] that they thought was a fanatic
[10:25] he talked about women wearing paint and
[10:28] everything and
[10:29] he was a kind of odd sort of a guy
[10:33] and this old fellow had come down and
[10:36] said to the king
[10:37] not even dudes go to call come until i
[10:40] call for it
[10:43] and we find out then he'd hit himself
[10:46] and run away from it
[10:48] and he hid out in the wilderness
[10:49] somewhere the company thought that maybe
[10:52] he had
[10:53] starved to death or perished but he had
[10:56] been fed pretty well
[10:58] water too and here he was
[11:02] come down and said do you see
[11:06] that i have thus saith the lord
[11:10] now if you're not convinced yet let's go
[11:12] up to the top of the mountain
[11:14] and prove who's gone or he had another
[11:18] vision from the lord
[11:20] he said choose your altar and make it
[11:24] and choose ox and slam
[11:27] i'll make an altar of the lord and also
[11:31] i will put ox on mine we'll both make a
[11:34] sacrifice and
[11:36] let the god that's god answered you know
[11:38] by no means done that
[11:40] if the lord hadn't told him he said so
[11:42] later
[11:43] i've done this and all this at your
[11:45] command lord
[11:46] but what's the attraction it's got 400
[11:50] priests standing on the hill
[11:52] and the king of therapies chariot with
[11:55] all of his
[11:56] armors and guards standing around and
[11:58] this old
[11:59] woolly fuzzy face looking man bald head
[12:02] and hairs hanging out over his face
[12:04] piece of sheepskin raped around him
[12:06] hairs all over his body
[12:08] standing up there with a stick in his
[12:09] hand a crucial oil in the other hand
[12:12] that just said three years and a half
[12:14] before that not even due will fall till
[12:17] i call from it
[12:18] for it taking the place of god with
[12:21] such things as halos and shatters and
[12:23] all they talk about
[12:25] and here that old fanatic standing up
[12:27] there on the hill
[12:29] bringing all these people up there what
[12:30] was that attraction
[12:32] it was god fixing to vindicate his
[12:35] prophet to be right
[12:39] was god fulfilling prophecy
[12:43] god also making history
[12:47] fulfilling the word
[12:50] a few hundred years after that there was
[12:53] a man
[12:54] anointed with that same spirit
[12:57] and he come out of the wilderness
[13:00] not connected with any organization so
[13:02] his daddy was an organization man
[13:05] a priest of an order
[13:08] but he come out of the wilderness
[13:11] dressed for the
[13:12] sheepskin around him hair all over his
[13:15] face instead of being gray it was black
[13:19] what was this man's attraction attracted
[13:21] all jerusalem in judea
[13:24] some of them going out says there's a
[13:25] wild man down there
[13:27] he's trying to drown the people in water
[13:30] whoever heard of such a thing as that
[13:33] others were curious and saying this must
[13:34] be the messiah
[13:36] one of them said it could be one of the
[13:37] prophets they didn't know what to think
[13:40] but what was it it was god
[13:44] fulfilling isaiah authority where he
[13:48] said behold
[13:49] what he would do in the last days i
[13:52] would send his servant
[13:54] what he would do
[13:57] then we find a few weeks after that that
[14:00] man
[14:01] being so positive of his message until
[14:03] he said there's one standing in among
[14:05] you
[14:06] whose shoes i'm not worthy to bear he
[14:09] will baptize you with the holy ghost and
[14:11] fire
[14:12] as i baptize with water one day an
[14:15] ordinary young man
[14:16] about 30 years old walked down and was
[14:18] baptized
[14:20] and when this man come there was such an
[14:23] attraction by the prophet the prophet
[14:26] acts strange that day
[14:30] the congregation couldn't help
[14:34] from watching the action of that prophet
[14:37] when he was debating with the priests
[14:39] across the river they said
[14:40] god built this altar god told us to do
[14:43] this
[14:44] moses is the prophet we believe moses
[14:47] the sacrifice will never be done away
[14:49] with i can hear john answer back
[14:51] that have not you read in the scripture
[14:54] what daniel the prophet said
[14:56] the daily sacrifice will be done away
[14:58] with
[15:01] that hour has arrived have not you read
[15:05] what isaiah said in the 40th chapter
[15:08] the voice of one crying in the
[15:10] wilderness prepare the way of the lord
[15:13] there's two prophecies for me and
[15:16] another thing
[15:17] did not you recognize our prophet 400
[15:20] years ago malachi
[15:22] when he spoke in the third chapter said
[15:23] behold i
[15:25] send my messenger before my face to
[15:27] prepare the way
[15:28] amen don't you know this fulfills
[15:31] prophecy
[15:33] prophecy was being fulfilled and about
[15:35] that time
[15:36] the prophet turned and said behold
[15:39] there comes a lamb of god that takes
[15:42] away the sin of the world
[15:45] now what's the attraction it's changed
[15:47] from the prophet to his prophecy
[15:51] now notice what comes to pass here comes
[15:53] an ordinary man
[15:55] known of no one a carpenter's son
[16:00] come walking out in the water when john
[16:02] the great prophet said
[16:04] i have need to be baptized with thee why
[16:06] come aside and he said suffer that to be
[16:07] so
[16:08] but as a prophet in the word it behooves
[16:12] us to fulfill all righteousness
[16:14] so he understood the sacrifice had to be
[16:16] washed before presented
[16:17] and he baptized it now
[16:20] there's another attraction takes place
[16:24] when he went up out of the water
[16:27] this prophet who had been so loyal
[16:30] to declare his age in the time
[16:34] he looked up and he saw the heavens open
[16:38] he saw the spirit of god like a dove
[16:40] descending upon him
[16:42] and a voice saying this is my beloved
[16:46] son
[16:46] in whom i'm well pleased god was
[16:50] vindicating a prophet's message
[16:53] what was attracting the attention at the
[16:55] journey
[16:58] a brother saying a while ago he was
[16:59] supposed to sing
[17:02] on the hills far away stood an old
[17:05] rugged cross
[17:07] what's the attraction on mount calvary
[17:11] when we see the religious world
[17:15] and condemning and the roman government
[17:20] had sentenced him to death and here he
[17:23] was
[17:24] hanging between two male factors
[17:28] starving for a drink blood running out
[17:31] of his body
[17:33] there he hangs crying my god
[17:37] my god why is i forsaking me and the
[17:40] religious
[17:41] people standing there looking at it
[17:44] little did they know that the prophecy
[17:47] of the old testament was being met right
[17:49] there at calvary that time
[17:52] david himself wrote i fell into the
[17:55] spirit like all prophets
[17:58] he act like it was him david cried in
[18:00] the 22nd psalm
[18:02] my god my god why has thou forsaken me
[18:07] all my bones they stare at me they
[18:09] pierce my hands and my feet
[18:12] david speaking like it was him
[18:15] and it wasn't david it was christ in
[18:18] david
[18:20] and yet the very prophecy that went
[18:22] forth of all the different prophets
[18:24] was being fulfilled on mount calvary
[18:28] what's the attraction on mount calvary
[18:31] god fulfilling his word
[18:35] another attraction was on the mount was
[18:38] on the day of pentecost
[18:40] when all of us up there in religious
[18:43] feasts
[18:43] thought they got rid of all the fanatics
[18:46] they hadn't heard from them for 10 days
[18:49] all of a sudden like a beehive they
[18:51] broke out of the top of the building
[18:53] out into the streets of screaming and
[18:54] carrying on what is this
[18:57] what meaneth this are all these men
[19:00] drunk
[19:02] watch and a prophet stood up among them
[19:07] as the order of a prophet should be it
[19:09] said ye man of israel
[19:11] and you that dwell in judea in jerusalem
[19:14] let this be known unto you and hearken
[19:15] in my words
[19:16] these are not drunk like you think they
[19:19] are
[19:20] but this is that amen which is spoken of
[19:24] by the lord to joy the prophet
[19:27] it shall come to pass in the last days
[19:29] i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[19:33] that was the attraction the religious
[19:35] people after crucifying the prince of
[19:37] life
[19:38] and everything still didn't see the
[19:40] promise
[19:42] of the coming of the holy spirit
[19:45] the attraction who is this what i mean
[19:48] at this what's the marathon people
[19:51] all mine it's the same today
[19:55] we'll bypass a lot of this to bring it
[19:58] to this hour
[19:59] the same thing is today the same thing
[20:03] is taking place the same questions as
[20:06] what's all that ranking look up and down
[20:09] the street

[20:22] afternoon
[20:23] was going down the street wife and i was
[20:25] looking at license on cars
[20:29] that's where i thought of this text what
[20:31] i mean
[20:34] just as it said where the carcass is
[20:38] there the eagles are gathered amen amen
[20:42] i said to my wife honey you remember the
[20:45] last night
[20:46] when i had to say goodbye to everything
[20:48] was dear to me on earth and go into the
[20:50] fields to start something
[20:52] that god had said do you sing that song
[20:55] oh they'll come from the east and the
[20:58] west

[21:02] to feast with our king to dine as his
[21:05] guest
[21:06] how blessed these pilgrims are beholding
[21:10] his hallowed face
[21:12] a glow with love divine blessed
[21:15] partakers of his grace
[21:17] had gems in his crown will shine
[21:21] that's what the attraction is the
[21:23] predestinated seed of god who can't do
[21:25] nothing else but follow it
[21:28] means more than life to us
[21:32] take our lives but don't take that
[21:35] what is the attraction
[21:40] god as usual fulfilling his word he's
[21:43] fulfilling the word
[21:44] of zechariah again a prophet zechariah
[21:48] read the ninth verse a while ago when
[21:50] jesus
[21:51] entered his temple riding or into
[21:53] jerusalem
[21:54] riding on a little white donkey
[21:58] the prophecy was fulfilled
[22:02] that zechariah said here it is

[22:15] just
[22:16] and having salvation lowly riding upon
[22:19] an
[22:19] ass and upon the colt the foal of an ass
[22:23] that's what the attraction was at
[22:24] jerusalem at the religious headquarters
[22:28] now we see a last day
[22:32] happening let's just turn a few pages on
[22:36] in zechariah and see what he said about
[22:38] it
[22:39] let's turn over then for the last days
[22:42] that was the middle age
[22:43] let's turn now to the last days and turn
[22:46] over to zechariah
[22:47] the 14th chapter and beginning with the
[22:50] fourth verse and listen
[22:52] and we're going to read down a portion
[22:55] of the scripture about nine verses

[23:01] is prophesying of his coming the lie
[23:04] states
[23:05] listen close now this is thus saith the
[23:07] lord it's the scripture

[23:15] it today zechariah 14
[23:17] speaking of his coming and his speech
[23:19] shall stand
[23:21] in that day upon the mount of olives
[23:24] again
[23:26] which is before jerusalem on the east
[23:29] on the mount of olives shall cleave in
[23:32] the midst thereof towards the east and
[23:34] towards the west
[23:35] and there shall be a very great valley
[23:38] hay for the mountain
[23:39] shall be moved towards the north and
[23:41] half towards the south
[23:43] and you shall flee to the valley of the
[23:46] mountains
[23:47] for the valley of the mountain shall
[23:50] reach from
[23:51] easel yea ye shall flee
[23:54] like you fled in the days of the
[23:57] earthquake
[23:58] in the days of uzziah the king of judah
[24:01] another earthquake splitting open the
[24:05] earth
[24:10] if you want to follow out a scripture
[24:12] here
[24:14] notice in this fifth verse it applies
[24:18] that the cleaving of the mount of olives
[24:20] is due to an earthquake
[24:22] and this is confirmed by isaiah 29
[24:25] 6 and revelation 16 9.
[24:29] exactly what is it the same prophet told
[24:32] of his first coming
[24:33] seen his second coming notice
[24:37] as in the days of the earthquake see
[24:39] what the earthquakes are doing see the
[24:40] predictions of them
[24:42] and the lord your god shall come and all
[24:46] his saints with thee and it shall come
[24:49] to pass
[24:51] in that day hallelujah
[24:55] in that day the light
[24:58] shall not be clear or dark but it shall
[25:01] be
[25:03] one day with one day which
[25:06] shall be known to the lord not day to
[25:09] night
[25:09] but it shall come to pass
[25:14] that in the evening time it shall be
[25:16] like
[25:19] oh god it shall be light
[25:24] about the evening time
[25:29] same prophet and the people is blind
[25:38] what's the attraction
[25:42] let's read a couple more verses
[25:46] and it shall be in that day that the
[25:48] living water shall go forth from
[25:50] jerusalem
[25:51] half of them towards the pharmacy and
[25:54] half towards the
[25:55] higher sea in the summer and winter
[25:57] shall it be the gospel going forth both
[25:59] jew and gentile
[26:00] and the lord shall be king
[26:04] over the earth in that day and there
[26:06] shall be
[26:07] one lord and his name one
[26:11] it shall be light
[26:14] about the evening time right
[26:18] the way to glory you will surely find
[26:21] in the waterway is the light today
[26:24] buried in the precious name of jesus
[26:28] young and old repent of all your sins
[26:32] the holy ghost will surely enter in the
[26:35] evening light has come it is a fact that
[26:39] god in christ
[26:40] are one
[26:43] see where we're at
[26:47] nations are breaking israel's awakening
[26:51] the signs that our prophets foretold
[26:53] that earthquake
[26:54] to the gentiles to the last day the
[26:56] gentile days numbered
[26:59] with horrors and cumbers return or
[27:02] disperse to your own
[27:04] you're this thing kicked out in these
[27:06] arks carried on new carts
[27:08] get out of there before death strikes
[27:09] you god has confirmed it
[27:12] it shall be sold let us turn over
[27:16] to another scripture in the old
[27:18] testament
[27:20] malachi the fourth chapter
[27:25] and read that little fourth chapter
[27:27] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[27:29] an oven
[27:30] and all the proud yea all that do wickly
[27:33] shall

[27:41] scofield here i certainly don't agree
[27:44] with him in these footnotes but he's got
[27:45] it lined out here right

[27:49] the
[27:50] second coming of christ and elijah
[27:53] beforehand

[27:58] lord of hosts
[27:59] and it shall lead them neither root
[28:03] nor branch where's the eternal hell in
[28:08] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[28:11] son of righteousness rise
[28:14] with healing campaigns healing in his
[28:17] wings

[28:20] of the stall
[28:22] and you shall tread down the wicked they
[28:24] shall be ashes under the souls of your
[28:26] feet in that day
[28:27] that i shall do this saith the lord of
[28:29] hosts remember the law of moses my

[28:51] before the coming of that great and
[28:53] dreadful day of the lord
