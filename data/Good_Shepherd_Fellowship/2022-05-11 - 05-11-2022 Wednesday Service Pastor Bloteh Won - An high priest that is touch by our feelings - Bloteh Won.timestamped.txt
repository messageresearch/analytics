[37:29] praise the lord thank you musicians
[37:32] let's take our bibles tonight in the
[37:34] book of hebrew praise the lord
[37:38] in the book of hebrew we
[37:41] started reading it on sunday
[37:44] about a priest that can be touched by
[37:46] the feelings of our infirmities we want
[37:48] to go back to there tonight
[37:51] amen
[37:53] i want to go right back to that tonight
[37:55] that would be
[37:57] hebrew chapter four that was where we
[38:00] started from
[38:15] chapter four let's start from verse 14.
[38:19] seeing then that we have
[38:21] a great high priest
[38:23] that is passed into the heavens
[38:26] we have to realize that before he went
[38:28] into the heavens he stood between heaven
[38:32] and the earth amen
[38:33] and he was standing between a living god
[38:36] and a dying humanity
[38:39] praise the lord
[38:40] seeing them that we have a great high
[38:42] priest that is passed into the heavens
[38:46] jesus
[38:47] the son of god
[38:49] let us hold fast
[38:51] our profession
[38:54] for we have met
[38:56] and high priest
[38:58] which cannot be touched
[39:01] with the feelings of our infirmities
[39:04] but was in all point tempted
[39:09] like as we are yet without sin
[39:14] let us therefore come bowling
[39:17] praise the lord
[39:19] that's the reason why we cannot be shy
[39:22] of our sin we cannot be
[39:24] uh you know we cannot hide we must come
[39:27] bolly we must come
[39:29] open line in another sense amen we must
[39:32] be open about it because he knows praise
[39:35] the lord
[39:36] the more we become open the better he
[39:39] can help us
[39:41] because he knows about it
[39:43] amen so uh i mean you've been shot about
[39:46] it
[39:47] you are only keeping
[39:49] uh
[39:50] an element of that weakness in your
[39:52] flesh
[39:53] but when you are open about it you know
[39:56] uh uh
[39:59] you know that's that just how to deal
[40:00] with that devil amen
[40:02] let us let us uh therefore come boldly
[40:05] onto the throne of grace
[40:08] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[40:13] to help
[40:15] in time of need
[40:18] chapter 5 verse 1
[40:19] for every high priest
[40:23] taken from among men
[40:26] is ordained
[40:28] for man
[40:31] intense pertaining to god
[40:35] for every high priest taking
[40:39] whether it was the sons of levite
[40:42] whether it was the sons of aaron whether
[40:44] it was the sons of finney heist or all
[40:48] the others high priests that were that
[40:50] i've ever served every high priest
[40:54] taken from a more man
[40:56] is ordained
[40:58] for men in the things pertaining to god
[41:01] that he may offer both gifts and
[41:05] sacrifices
[41:07] for sins
[41:11] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[41:15] or on them that are out of the way for
[41:18] that he himself also
[41:21] is compassed with
[41:23] infirmities
[41:26] praise the lord
[41:28] amen
[41:29] so the high priest
[41:31] is just
[41:34] as in need as you are in need
[41:39] praise the lord that's what paul is
[41:41] establishing here
[41:43] we have a high priest that can be
[41:45] touched with our infirmities but every
[41:48] high priest that is taken from a more
[41:51] man
[41:53] for the service of god the things
[41:55] pertaining to god
[41:57] he's not like that high praise that can
[42:00] be touched by the feelings of our
[42:02] infirmities because he himself he have
[42:05] infirmities
[42:07] praise the lord
[42:09] i cannot be touched by the feeling of
[42:11] your infirmities i don't know what
[42:12] you're doing i don't know what's going
[42:14] on with you until you tell me
[42:19] are we together
[42:21] let's read a little bit
[42:24] amen
[42:28] and by reason
[42:30] year of he ought as for the people
[42:34] so also for himself to offer
[42:38] for sins
[42:40] amen
[42:41] and no man taking
[42:44] this honor unto himself
[42:48] but he that is call of god
[42:53] as was aaron praise the lord
[42:56] let us pray tonight heavenly father
[42:59] almighty god and
[43:01] what
[43:02] what a calling lord
[43:04] the lord we will be able to stand lord
[43:06] in the place
[43:08] for aaron lord god he knew
[43:12] he had a word from the prophet moses
[43:17] when you told him
[43:19] to tell
[43:20] his brother
[43:22] aaron to self in the priest's office
[43:26] father lord for finney house he had a
[43:28] word

[45:25] with our feelings
[45:26] he can be touched
[45:28] by our feelings he can be touched with
[45:30] our feelings by our feelings
[45:32] praise the lord
[45:34] he's he's different
[45:37] praise the lord
[45:38] he's the very creator of feelings
[45:43] amen
[45:46] he's different
[45:49] i this this particular
[45:52] bible verse stays in my mind because
[45:54] many years ago i can remember now that
[45:57] would be somewhere in the 90s i had one
[45:59] young brother
[46:00] there was that was oh my goodness this
[46:03] young brother he will he would throw
[46:05] questions to me like somebody is
[46:07] throwing oranges
[46:14] and one time he came and asked me the
[46:16] question
[46:18] and says uh
[46:19] uh
[46:21] berwana
[46:22] uh
[46:24] i gets confused here on this on this
[46:26] verse
[46:27] the bible is saying that for we have met
[46:31] on high priest
[46:33] which cannot
[46:34] be touched i think it was the net we
[46:37] have met and high priest throw him off
[46:41] in understanding that jesus cannot be
[46:43] touched by the feelings of our
[46:45] infirmities so we had a good uh
[46:48] one-on-one bible study on that so it's
[46:51] kind of a stick out to me
[46:53] uh just from that experience with that
[46:55] young brother praise the lord
[46:57] praise the lord
[46:59] but tonight we want to just look into
[47:01] this thought we'll go back a little bit
[47:04] and uh uh if you if you read a book of
[47:07] hebrew you study the book of hebrew and
[47:10] also you go and study
[47:12] a hebrew exposition you will realize
[47:16] that just like we said for some reason
[47:20] some reason because the apostle paul i
[47:22] hope one of these days i can be able to
[47:25] to just take you through the scripture
[47:28] from from the time paul was convicted in
[47:31] in in through the writing of his books
[47:34] so you'll be able to see some some
[47:36] beautiful things that sometimes slips
[47:38] our our view when we are reading
[47:41] but paul was never accepted by the by
[47:44] the jewish people
[47:46] uh the hebrew people the jewish people
[47:49] and because they felt like he he
[47:51] betrayed them
[47:53] so even uh uh
[47:55] [Music]
[47:58] you know
[48:00] even at the time word there was a
[48:03] prophecy from acaba for him not to go to
[48:06] jerusalem he stayed what determined to
[48:09] go to jerusalem or go to rome and he
[48:11] wanted to go through jerusalem we
[48:13] realized that every time he showed up in
[48:16] in the synagogues there was always a
[48:18] riot
[48:19] you know they would have to sneak him
[48:21] out
[48:22] they were they were there were people
[48:24] that were determined you know to end the
[48:26] life of paul because they felt like he
[48:29] he he betrayed
[48:31] the council the jewish council but uh uh
[48:35] we we als we are also glad that uh the
[48:38] lord kind of for change his path the
[48:40] lord there with him
[48:41] and uh and the lord used him in such a
[48:44] tremendous way to be able to bring us
[48:46] the new testament amen
[48:49] so we realized there were there were
[48:51] three men that were that were uh
[48:53] responsible for the for the word of the
[48:56] lord moses brought the the torah he
[49:00] brought the old testament to the to the
[49:03] children of israel
[49:04] and
[49:06] paul wrote the the new testament
[49:09] and then
[49:11] god promised by the by the ministry of
[49:14] an elijah prophet in malachi 4
[49:17] that uh the the the mysteries will be
[49:20] revealed
[49:22] so uh both the old testament uh how one
[49:26] that was that wrote it the first five
[49:28] books every other books in the old
[49:30] testament is all surrounding the five
[49:32] books amen
[49:34] and
[49:35] in the new testament we realized that
[49:38] the ministry of grace was given to paul
[49:40] he actually wrote the new testament we
[49:42] know you know peter wrote his account we
[49:45] know the uh marty mark luke and john
[49:47] wrote their own account and all of that
[49:50] but
[49:51] uh the uh the gospel in the in uh in the
[49:55] new testament was written by paul it's
[49:57] strange that he says that god will judge
[50:00] this word by my gospel
[50:02] and which of course is the gospel the
[50:04] ministry of grace he was talking about
[50:07] now now
[50:10] and then you and myself we feel blessed
[50:12] to be able to be sitting on the uh the
[50:16] ministry of of of brother branham you
[50:19] know what god's god's prophet to this
[50:21] generation or this age because we we see
[50:25] that uh uh the fulfillment of re
[50:29] revealing the mysteries
[50:31] you know uh it was fulfilled in his
[50:34] ministry
[50:35] we that's that is that is a beautiful
[50:37] thing to look at you read the book of of
[50:41] dania you will realize that the angel
[50:43] told daniel to shut those things
[50:47] he was showing daniel he said shut it
[50:49] until the time of the end
[50:53] amen
[50:54] the angel says shut it till the time of
[50:56] the end
[50:58] and then also when it when it when uh uh
[51:01] uh uh
[51:03] jesus in the midst of the seven golden
[51:05] candlesticks were revealing the the time
[51:08] of the end of the future of the church
[51:10] to john but then it came a time also
[51:13] where he told john to shut those things
[51:15] up
[51:17] amen so just like he told daniel to shut
[51:20] those things he also told john to shut
[51:23] it
[51:24] the beautiful thing there is that when
[51:26] you look at the parallel you will
[51:28] realize just at that time he was giving
[51:32] uh dania the vision
[51:35] the injured there was an angel that
[51:37] appeared unto unto daniel
[51:40] amen
[51:41] a mighty angel
[51:43] michael
[51:45] a great angel
[51:47] yes
[51:49] in revelation 10
[51:52] you realize also there was a mighty
[51:55] angel
[51:56] that also appeared
[51:58] unto john
[52:00] so you see the uh uh this are that
[52:04] uh
[52:05] things
[52:06] that uh you know that that i developed
[52:09] or uh uh you know that were that were
[52:12] coca
[52:13] uh somewhere else praise the lord
[52:16] i don't bother by the light amen
[52:18] let's hold the light down
[52:21] glory be to god
[52:23] amen
[52:26] praise the lord
[52:30] so uh uh uh you know so it's it's very
[52:33] beautiful
[52:34] it's very beautiful but as we just want
[52:37] to to to to keep us together tonight for
[52:41] the
[52:41] uh the the wednesday
[52:44] evening sacrifice
[52:47] before we get to talking let me just
[52:49] travel with you a little bit as we look
[52:51] in the book of hebrew year
[52:52] you realize that the book of hebrew just
[52:55] like we said paul had his identity
[52:58] because he was sending this to the to
[53:01] the jewish believers
[53:03] and with most of them that struggle you
[53:06] know with hearing about him you know uh
[53:09] uh you you can even imagine uh
[53:12] god had to reveal show gave ananias a
[53:15] vision and say ananias go and have paul
[53:17] you know for analyzing lord jesus you
[53:19] know that man you know how he killed the
[53:22] the christians you know so all of that
[53:25] and uh
[53:26] uh so
[53:29] uh
[53:29] [Music]
[53:31] in the book of romans paul also
[53:33] expressed his desire for his for his
[53:36] brethren
[53:37] this is the desire that i have for my
[53:40] brethren he was talking about the jews
[53:43] i wish that god would open their eyes
[53:45] the same way he have opened my eyes
[53:49] paul realized that
[53:52] the jehovah of the old testament
[53:55] was
[53:56] jesus christ
[53:59] praise the lord
[54:01] that that was the revelation
[54:03] when when he had that experience on the
[54:05] road of damascus
[54:07] and and and from that light says i am
[54:11] jesus
[54:12] [Music]
[54:13] whom you persecute
[54:16] that changed the life of paul
[54:19] it changed his life
[54:21] forever
[54:24] praise the lord
[54:26] so
[54:28] the scripture will let us to know
[54:30] that
[54:34] paul had to go in in the in the desert
[54:37] of arabia
[54:38] for three years
[54:40] for him to study the old testament
[54:43] and while he was there
[54:45] the holy spirit started dealing with him
[54:49] the holy spirit started taking him from
[54:51] genesis
[54:53] through all the old testament
[54:59] praise the lord
[55:02] so uh
[55:04] so as he went through that
[55:09] that's where he drew this inspiration
[55:12] for the for the book of hebrew
[55:16] so poor year
[55:18] in the book of hebrew now what he's
[55:20] going to do that i want you to catch
[55:24] and and go back take your time read the
[55:26] book of hebrew you will see it a
[55:28] different way
[55:29] paul
[55:31] is going to exalt jesus
[55:36] that's what he's doing in the book of
[55:37] hebrew he's exalting jesus
[55:40] above everything
[55:45] amen
[55:46] and it is troubling
[55:49] told
[55:50] to a jewish student
[55:54] because there were there were things
[55:56] that were very important to the jews
[55:59] you don't play with their prophet
[56:02] that's right
[56:03] amen
[56:05] the jews believe in angers
[56:10] which of course that was what made the
[56:12] sarah the the the pharisees different
[56:14] from the sadducees
[56:16] amen they believe in angels
[56:19] and the the jews they had a hiri guy
[56:24] for
[56:26] their temple
[56:30] they respected their sacrifice so you
[56:32] will see paul as he goes through the the
[56:36] entire episode of hebrew he's exalting
[56:40] jesus above every one of that right
[56:45] he absorbed jesus above the promises
[56:51] praise the lord
[56:54] i know it is it's the weather
[56:56] so uh
[56:58] we will we will not keep you long amen
[57:01] don't worry we'll be okay
[57:13] yeah i think i think we're in the safest
[57:15] place
[57:17] at the feet of jesus okay
[57:19] amen amen
[57:22] praise the lord
[57:24] now so so all of these things
[57:27] are happening here here in the book of
[57:29] hebrew that's where i want to grab your
[57:32] attention
[57:33] okay
[57:34] that's what i want us to to grab your
[57:36] attention and and and then you will then
[57:39] you will appreciate right
[57:42] you know you will appreciate as you
[57:44] study the book of hebrew
[57:46] you appreciate so paul goes ahead
[57:50] let me start here
[57:54] praise the lord
[58:05] we'll read this
[58:07] from hebrew chapter 2
[58:11] that's that's that's actually from
[58:16] from a quote
[58:17] in hebrew chapter 2.
[58:21] so reading from hebrew exposition now
[58:25] praise the lord
[58:28] hebrew chapter 2
[58:32] in the first chapter
[58:35] in the broadband i'm expressing this in
[58:37] the first chapter we find that
[58:40] it was exalting the lord jesus
[58:44] so he says here that uh
[58:46] paul was exalting the lord jesus
[58:52] and paul
[58:54] let us know
[58:56] the other night he's going through the
[58:57] series so i just i just took a few of
[58:59] these uh you know uh baiting pieces here
[59:02] and there just to be able to throw a
[59:04] note up so you'll be able to grab the
[59:06] thought of what we are going through
[59:08] tonight so he says in the first chapter
[59:12] paul started exalting the lord jesus
[59:14] chapter one hebrew chapter one let's
[59:16] read he says god
[59:19] who are saundra times
[59:22] in davao manum
[59:24] speak in time past
[59:27] unto the fathers by the prophets
[59:31] amen
[59:33] so paul
[59:34] is is letting that those believers know
[59:37] that we believe in our prophets
[59:40] [Music]
[59:41] they will god must peace
[59:44] praise the lord amen
[59:48] he said brought half in in in these last
[59:52] days
[59:53] spoken unto us
[59:56] by his son
[1:00:00] he have appointed ears of all things so
[1:00:03] you see he put the prophets there
[1:00:06] but then he exhort the lord jesus
[1:00:10] above the prophets
[1:00:15] are we together
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:18] are you seeing the picture
[1:00:22] then he goes down he says here
[1:00:25] in verse 4 chapter one
[1:00:29] which of course brother brahma says here
[1:00:31] also there in hebrew chapter two he says
[1:00:34] the other
[1:00:35] uh uh
[1:00:36] well let me see i think as i thought i
[1:00:39] said my notes up there well okay let's
[1:00:42] just go let's go ahead tonight
[1:00:45] so he says here in he says
[1:00:48] in in the first chapter we find that it
[1:00:50] was uh that it was uh uh exalting the
[1:00:54] lord jesus and paul let us know the
[1:00:58] other night that he was
[1:01:01] in the great beginning
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:05] so as we look in in chapter one
[1:01:09] we we see how paul
[1:01:12] exulted jesus
[1:01:13] and also
[1:01:15] we we we're going to see something here
[1:01:19] uh
[1:01:21] okay
[1:01:22] have in this last day spoken to us
[1:01:25] spoken unto us by his son whom he have
[1:01:27] appointed heroes of all things by whom
[1:01:30] also
[1:01:31] he made
[1:01:34] the words
[1:01:36] so
[1:01:37] so that's that is that is the talk that
[1:01:39] brother branham also is giving us here
[1:01:41] that paul
[1:01:42] you know we if we find him exalting uh
[1:01:45] the lord jesus in the beginning and paul
[1:01:47] led us to know the other night that he
[1:01:49] was in the beginning by him all things
[1:01:52] was made
[1:01:54] and he goes ahead again he says
[1:01:57] and we found out that
[1:02:00] he was nothing less than metisside
[1:02:05] the king of solomon
[1:02:07] that would show up over in chapter seven
[1:02:11] between chapter five and chapter seven
[1:02:13] of hebrew that were the story of
[1:02:15] matrices that would come but
[1:02:17] the reason why that would come up is
[1:02:20] because right in there
[1:02:22] paul is teaching of a better high priest
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:30] his teaching even though
[1:02:32] we have the levitical priesthood
[1:02:36] as jews as us as as jewish believers god
[1:02:40] obeying aaron we have the aaronic
[1:02:42] priesthood which also linked with the
[1:02:44] levitica priesthood and by year paul now
[1:02:48] were used there between chapter 5 and 7
[1:02:52] to show that there was a better
[1:02:54] priesthood
[1:02:58] and in that
[1:03:00] also he's exalting jesus
[1:03:05] now you have to realize that jesus
[1:03:07] himself said
[1:03:10] if i be lifted up
[1:03:12] i will draw all men
[1:03:15] that is that is just the secret
[1:03:18] to drawing man is just lift up jesus
[1:03:23] praise the lord just lift him up
[1:03:26] and then he says also and evie may
[1:03:30] the angels worship him let's see there
[1:03:33] in the scripture
[1:03:34] verse four
[1:03:36] let's drop will not be able to go
[1:03:37] through the entire book of hebrew
[1:03:39] tonight neither i'm not preaching on the
[1:03:41] book of hebrew
[1:03:42] being made so
[1:03:44] much better that's the word you will
[1:03:46] come you will find over and over
[1:03:50] you remember the statement
[1:03:53] uh uh uh
[1:03:58] we come under use it it's a statement
[1:04:00] that's that talks about
[1:04:02] the blood of ebay
[1:04:09] speak better
[1:04:10] so you will always find that language
[1:04:13] better he keep using it a better high
[1:04:16] priest
[1:04:17] a better promise
[1:04:19] a better rest
[1:04:23] it's a word that he used continuously
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:30] he said being made so much better than
[1:04:33] the angels
[1:04:35] as he have
[1:04:37] by inheritance obtain more excellent
[1:04:40] name than day
[1:04:41] who was he talking about jesus
[1:04:44] praise the lord
[1:04:46] who was he talking about
[1:04:50] class please answer me
[1:04:55] praise the lord
[1:05:06] be made so much better than the angels
[1:05:09] as he have
[1:05:10] by uh inheritance altina more excellent
[1:05:13] name than they
[1:05:15] for unto which of the angels
[1:05:19] say he at any time thou are my son this
[1:05:22] day have i begotten thee
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:25] he never said that to none of the angels
[1:05:27] okay
[1:05:29] praise the lord
[1:05:30] now this is where i want to grab you now
[1:05:32] verse 6.
[1:05:33] and again
[1:05:35] when he bringeth in
[1:05:38] their first begotten
[1:05:41] into the word what was the first
[1:05:43] begotten the logos
[1:05:47] amen
[1:05:48] when he bring the first begotten into
[1:05:51] the word
[1:05:55] he said
[1:05:57] and let all the angels of god worship
[1:06:01] him
[1:06:02] that was when god
[1:06:05] became god
[1:06:08] because god is not a he's not god until
[1:06:11] he having subject to worship him because
[1:06:14] god is an object of worship
[1:06:21] are we together
[1:06:32] so we see here that uh
[1:06:35] uh
[1:06:36] all he was doing he was just exalting
[1:06:38] jesus
[1:06:41] so he assaulted him
[1:06:42] in the beginning he assaulted him over
[1:06:45] the prophets he assaulted him over the
[1:06:48] angels he there poured there with that
[1:06:50] seriously because he he
[1:06:53] he had to bring because uh uh uh to the
[1:06:56] jewish faith
[1:06:57] that these things were very important
[1:07:00] they were very very very important
[1:07:04] they believe in their prophets
[1:07:08] they believe in angels
[1:07:10] you read from the scripture it was it
[1:07:12] was angers that deliver the ten
[1:07:15] commandments to moses
[1:07:21] praise the lord
[1:07:24] so the jews believe in there
[1:07:26] now so you come over to uh uh
[1:07:30] you come over to to chapter two you know
[1:07:33] he's he's he's making uh emphasis on
[1:07:36] that
[1:07:37] so just just so we can speed up and get
[1:07:40] to where we want to get tonight i just i
[1:07:42] just use that to be able to
[1:07:46] give you an idea of what uh
[1:07:48] we will we we will be looking at
[1:07:53] there are a few scriptures there that
[1:07:56] are that are standing in my face but let
[1:07:58] me go to what i want to talk about
[1:07:59] tonight so he's he's talking about uh uh
[1:08:03] so he exalted
[1:08:05] jesus above the prophets above the
[1:08:07] angels above the priesthood he says
[1:08:11] we
[1:08:12] in jesus we have a better covenant
[1:08:16] praise the lord
[1:08:18] in jesus we have a better promise
[1:08:23] in jesus
[1:08:25] we have a better rest
[1:08:29] because he said if if if the rest that
[1:08:33] he gave
[1:08:34] the sabbath rest
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:38] if it was enough for the people he would
[1:08:41] not have promised them another day
[1:08:47] so because he gave them a promise of
[1:08:50] another day which means there is a
[1:08:53] better rest onto the people of god
[1:09:00] are we together
[1:09:02] so he's exalting jesus here in in every
[1:09:05] way
[1:09:07] i want to make sure that i'm not i'm not
[1:09:10] uh
[1:09:11] i'm not missing anything here
[1:09:13] in this beginning are we together
[1:09:17] praise the lord
[1:09:26] now so
[1:09:27] as we look at this the reason why i'm
[1:09:30] saying this is because when we come to
[1:09:32] talking about the high priest
[1:09:36] that can be touched by the feelings of
[1:09:38] our infirmities
[1:09:40] this high priest that high priest he's
[1:09:43] not he's not a uh uh
[1:09:46] like uh uh the the priests in the in the
[1:09:50] in the tabernacle it's not like the old
[1:09:53] testament high priests
[1:09:55] so
[1:09:55] paul is uh trying to establish a thought
[1:09:58] here that because god has given us a
[1:10:01] better covenant
[1:10:03] and and uh
[1:10:04] you know a better promise and all of
[1:10:06] that and even there was a better blood
[1:10:09] that speak better things than the blood
[1:10:11] of abed amen
[1:10:12] so
[1:10:13] uh he he's talking here that also he has
[1:10:18] given us a high priest that have passed
[1:10:20] into the heaven jesus the son of god
[1:10:24] and this high priest
[1:10:27] he can be touched
[1:10:28] by the feelings
[1:10:30] of our infirmities
[1:10:33] praise the lord
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:38] because he make an intercession for us
[1:10:42] he says your high priest you have the
[1:10:45] local ones the one that god has ordained
[1:10:48] and more men to save you in the things
[1:10:51] of god
[1:10:54] they also have infirmities
[1:10:58] that's the reason why
[1:10:59] when they go to offer same for the
[1:11:02] people they also have to offer sin for
[1:11:05] themselves
[1:11:06] because they they also have infirmities
[1:11:09] they have weaknesses they have
[1:11:11] limitations
[1:11:15] but the better high priest we have he
[1:11:18] have no limitations
[1:11:23] praise the lord
[1:11:24] and when he and when he offered himself
[1:11:27] as a sacrifice it was not for himself it
[1:11:30] was for the people
[1:11:34] are we together
[1:11:36] now so establishing this thought is is
[1:11:40] to bring us to this place
[1:11:42] because if if you don't if you don't
[1:11:44] balance the the types and shadow you
[1:11:48] will you will run into water and you get
[1:11:50] drowned
[1:11:52] praise the lord you'll run into places
[1:11:55] and then you will drown yourself and and
[1:11:57] then you will you will create it will
[1:11:59] create a lot of confusion in your mind
[1:12:01] because sometimes people think that uh
[1:12:05] uh you know all of those things that god
[1:12:07] gives us a shadow and and uh speaking
[1:12:10] about the better high priest he's the
[1:12:12] chief shepherd amen he's the great
[1:12:14] shepherd he's the good shepherd
[1:12:17] praise the lord
[1:12:18] when this church was named good shepherd
[1:12:20] i don't think they were thinking about
[1:12:21] me
[1:12:23] they were thinking about him
[1:12:25] because he's the good shepherd
[1:12:31] now so
[1:12:32] i said that
[1:12:35] because this gone sunday we were dealing
[1:12:39] with
[1:12:39] standing between the living and the dead
[1:12:42] but the inspiration was more on feelings
[1:12:47] praise the lord
[1:12:49] amen
[1:12:50] it was more on feelings
[1:12:53] but i will come tonight again and and i
[1:12:55] will read something from hebrew chapter
[1:12:57] three
[1:12:58] uh there's there's uh that's from the
[1:13:00] message hebrew exposition brother
[1:13:01] branham who says something this this my
[1:13:04] mic keep falling and pulling my ear off
[1:13:07] it looks like i gotta pull a lot of it
[1:13:09] off
[1:13:10] tonight
[1:13:12] i think maybe my vest is the one that is
[1:13:14] uh
[1:13:15] or something is pulling it down okay
[1:13:18] so what what i want to take now tonight
[1:13:21] brother brandon is going to tell us a
[1:13:22] story about uh uh
[1:13:24] uh
[1:13:26] rosetta
[1:13:28] rosella was a young woman that was
[1:13:30] caught up in drugs
[1:13:32] and and she was i mean she was known as
[1:13:36] a drug addict there was there was just
[1:13:38] no
[1:13:39] no
[1:13:40] i mean she went from one
[1:13:43] treatment house to another treatment
[1:13:45] house and she got completely delivered
[1:13:48] on the brother brandon ministry
[1:13:51] praise the lord she got completely
[1:13:53] delivered from drugs and then brother
[1:13:55] branham is going to tell a little story
[1:13:57] about her yet when she when she got
[1:13:59] delivered her mother was a praying woman
[1:14:01] her mother was always praying for her
[1:14:04] and just like we were saying on sunday
[1:14:06] uh my mothers never never lost feelings
[1:14:09] for their baby you know we had all the
[1:14:11] same uh a parabola all saying the
[1:14:14] parents are all people say there is no
[1:14:16] bad bush for the child
[1:14:18] you know mothers don't have babush
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:23] praise the lord meaning that they can
[1:14:25] never throw their child away no matter
[1:14:28] how bad they are
[1:14:30] so her mother were always praying for
[1:14:32] her and believing that god would have
[1:14:34] done something for her it was uh you
[1:14:36] know uh there's a testimony on there
[1:14:40] uh but when when she got safe
[1:14:46] it affected her so much
[1:14:49] to see this woman that could not go at
[1:14:52] night without drugs
[1:14:54] to see that she had no desire
[1:14:58] hallelujah
[1:14:59] she was so touched by this until
[1:15:03] she wanted to go on the street and and
[1:15:06] she wanted to stand right in the highway
[1:15:08] and tell everybody about jesus
[1:15:12] praise the lord
[1:15:14] and she was not going to argue about
[1:15:16] water baptizing
[1:15:18] or she was not going to argue about
[1:15:20] trinity or what doctrine you believe
[1:15:23] or she was going to tell you that i was
[1:15:26] one a drug addict
[1:15:30] and jesus
[1:15:32] changed my life
[1:15:34] and jesus delivered me that was the only
[1:15:36] message she had
[1:15:40] praise the lord
[1:15:41] now so brother branham is going to talk
[1:15:43] about heart a little bit i'm yeah i'll
[1:15:45] just pick up something there as we go
[1:15:47] along tonight he says and to see a
[1:15:50] lovely little lady like rosetta
[1:15:54] and just seizing
[1:15:56] and now she's very respectable
[1:16:01] she got
[1:16:03] fee a call in her heart
[1:16:07] but knowing the bible
[1:16:09] about woman preachers see
[1:16:12] she know is something else
[1:16:15] now because of what jesus have done in
[1:16:18] her life
[1:16:20] she's having this feeling to go and tell
[1:16:22] everybody about jesus
[1:16:25] but yet she also know in the scripture
[1:16:29] the place of a woman
[1:16:32] amen
[1:16:34] now watch this now
[1:16:37] that's where we we we're going to wrap
[1:16:39] this whole thing around around this
[1:16:41] thought tonight
[1:16:42] but knowing the bible about about women
[1:16:45] preachers see
[1:16:47] she knows it was something else
[1:16:50] and god is leading her
[1:16:53] into jails and things
[1:16:55] to give testimony
[1:16:58] it's just wonderful to know
[1:17:01] to seek after the will of god
[1:17:05] sometimes
[1:17:06] we have a feeling
[1:17:10] but we want to carry that feeling
[1:17:13] into
[1:17:14] places
[1:17:16] if you don't watch
[1:17:18] the devil will take that feeling
[1:17:22] and pervert it into something
[1:17:28] but as long as we stay with the bible
[1:17:34] as long as we stay with the word of god
[1:17:37] what does that mean it means that the
[1:17:40] word of god creates
[1:17:42] boundaries to govern our feelings
[1:17:50] praise the lord
[1:17:52] the word of god create boundaries when
[1:17:55] god created right in the beginning not
[1:17:58] only our feelings everything that god
[1:18:01] created
[1:18:02] he also created boundaries
[1:18:06] let the sun shine by day
[1:18:09] and the moon by night they knew their
[1:18:11] boundaries
[1:18:15] let the water come this far
[1:18:22] praise the lord
[1:18:28] so when we talk about feelings
[1:18:31] not losing feelings it's not a feeling
[1:18:34] that just flow around like a floor that
[1:18:36] is going to take the entire city
[1:18:41] that because you should have feeling you
[1:18:42] should just have feelings
[1:18:45] if feelings does not have boundaries
[1:18:50] it becomes destructive
[1:19:00] are we together
[1:19:05] if feelings do not have boundaries so
[1:19:07] when we talk about uh
[1:19:10] uh uh you know uh uh moses losing the
[1:19:13] feeling of the people
[1:19:15] i mean it was it was not you know uh uh
[1:19:19] uh
[1:19:20] it was a sense of the fact that
[1:19:22] everything that he was doing trying to
[1:19:25] bring them in in understanding the
[1:19:27] commission that he had
[1:19:30] they were not seeing it
[1:19:32] they were all about oh we don't have
[1:19:34] food to eat today all the water is
[1:19:37] bitter oh where is the garlic of egypt
[1:19:40] that was the thing he was they were
[1:19:42] trying to drag him back into
[1:19:45] into their senseless feelings for the
[1:19:48] garlic and and all the fleshly thing
[1:19:51] when the thing he was trying to point
[1:19:52] them to was the promise of god
[1:20:07] i praise the lord
[1:20:18] just as much as god want us to have
[1:20:21] feelings for his people
[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:26] it's not the feelings to be able to make
[1:20:29] you to catch up with what is on youtube
[1:20:31] and make you to catch up with what is
[1:20:33] what is uh that is is to bring you in
[1:20:36] the place
[1:20:37] of the word of god for the hour
[1:20:40] the word of god for the hour
[1:20:54] praise the lord
[1:20:58] because sometimes
[1:21:00] we have feelings
[1:21:03] it's a sense
[1:21:05] of our body
[1:21:08] praise the lord
[1:21:09] in a way our spirit reacts to it is
[1:21:12] through our emotions
[1:21:17] praise the lord
[1:21:19] but you see
[1:21:21] almighty god
[1:21:24] create a boundary
[1:21:29] praise the lord
[1:21:31] to be able to keep us protected
[1:21:36] to keep us safe
[1:21:43] as parents we have feelings
[1:21:45] for our children
[1:21:47] but yet god gave us boundary
[1:21:51] praise lord
[1:21:54] it could be your child
[1:21:56] and if you don't keep that hundred
[1:22:01] that loving emotion will turn to an
[1:22:04] abuse
[1:22:10] as your pastor i should have feelings
[1:22:12] for you
[1:22:14] but god help me to know my boundaries
[1:22:18] praise the lord
[1:22:20] god help me to know my boundaries i'm
[1:22:23] not the high priest that is touched by
[1:22:25] the feelings of your infirmities i don't
[1:22:27] know what you are going through if you
[1:22:28] don't tell me i don't know
[1:22:32] i don't know
[1:22:47] and sometimes it's a good thing that i
[1:22:48] don't know
[1:22:50] because it gives me the liberty
[1:22:53] to be able to stay behind that word
[1:23:01] and preach
[1:23:06] as humans
[1:23:09] when i know i struggle sometimes
[1:23:16] because i will now want to
[1:23:18] to to to to abuse that
[1:23:22] you trust me
[1:23:23] with uh
[1:23:25] things that you are going through and
[1:23:26] then i use the pulpit to come at you no
[1:23:30] if i speak about it you might just know
[1:23:32] that you know it's it's it was not
[1:23:37] directly at you
[1:23:39] it was because
[1:23:41] the holy spirit wanted it to be a
[1:23:42] blessing
[1:23:44] but why am i saying this
[1:23:47] you see because
[1:23:51] in the message i don't know why i never
[1:23:53] thought about this it came across my
[1:23:55] mind but
[1:23:56] why i never thought about it by any
[1:23:58] message how can i overcome
[1:24:00] that's the only message where brother
[1:24:03] branham used a passing statement
[1:24:06] where he says
[1:24:07] your pastor is your spiritual husband
[1:24:11] it was a passing statement he was
[1:24:13] talking about lot
[1:24:16] and his wife
[1:24:18] and and and that statement
[1:24:22] has uh
[1:24:23] you know uh it has been a blessing to
[1:24:26] many people and also it has been a
[1:24:28] statement where people have used in in
[1:24:30] different different ways
[1:24:34] praise the lord
[1:24:37] paul says i mean peter says there in the
[1:24:39] book of
[1:24:40] acts he says
[1:24:42] choose you seven men
[1:24:44] so they can't
[1:24:47] so they can be able to attend to your
[1:24:48] effects
[1:24:51] and we can give ourselves to praying
[1:24:55] and to fasting and to study the word of
[1:24:57] god
[1:24:59] praise the lord
[1:25:03] my job is not to show up at every baby
[1:25:06] birthday party show up every
[1:25:10] you know baby shower show up on average
[1:25:13] you know if if the time is there to do
[1:25:15] it okay
[1:25:26] thank you
[1:25:29] and uh uh it's it's uh you know if the
[1:25:32] time is there you know and and
[1:25:34] fellowship you know well
[1:25:35] uh
[1:25:37] i mean
[1:25:42] it's not i mean after every service you
[1:25:44] know bring everybody you know uh let's
[1:25:46] let's go over to the to the you know to
[1:25:49] the beach
[1:25:50] and you know you got to spend time with
[1:25:52] your pastor and all of those kind of
[1:25:54] kind of things
[1:25:57] well i'm sorry i'm not caught that way
[1:26:01] i'm not caught that
[1:26:06] way praise the lord
[1:26:11] because
[1:26:13] when feelings are not guided
[1:26:18] the nation
[1:26:20] had just went through i've i've been
[1:26:22] i've been putting some things together
[1:26:25] especially for
[1:26:27] for
[1:26:28] the young people
[1:26:31] and uh
[1:26:32] um
[1:26:34] i'm trusting that uh by june next month
[1:26:37] we should bring it to you
[1:26:38] uh uh you know with all of these
[1:26:42] uh
[1:26:43] weddings that are popping up
[1:26:46] i would like to uh take some time in and
[1:26:49] and talk to you on how uh
[1:26:52] i think as a church year
[1:26:54] uh we should approach those things amen
[1:27:00] and uh yeah we just went through i try
[1:27:04] to close right now
[1:27:07] this weather has been hanging all
[1:27:09] through the day even at work there were
[1:27:11] you know alarm going on
[1:27:13] of
[1:27:14] of the weather being
[1:27:16] being
[1:27:18] awful
[1:27:20] and it looks like the devil just kept it
[1:27:22] to wait for us in service tonight
[1:27:26] praise the lord
[1:27:28] amen
[1:27:29] so we just found a place to close here
[1:27:32] then we can continue another time
[1:27:35] but we just went through the entire
[1:27:37] nation was put on
[1:27:40] a standstill
[1:27:42] just because
[1:27:47] a very nice person
[1:27:49] crossed the boundaries of their feelings
[1:27:55] a very professional woman
[1:27:58] that had worked as a corrections officer
[1:28:00] for 17 years
[1:28:08] giving an authority
[1:28:11] by the country trusted second-in-command
[1:28:17] to that facility
[1:28:21] because she allow her feelings
[1:28:24] to cross
[1:28:26] the boundary that was given to her
[1:28:31] she's lying in the mall
[1:28:34] right right dead
[1:28:39] she allow her feelings
[1:28:42] everything she has worked for she was
[1:28:44] just about to retire
[1:28:49] because she kept hanging around the
[1:28:51] wrong person
[1:28:56] and created a feeling
[1:28:58] for a killer
[1:29:09] so it's not just oh i feel for this
[1:29:12] person or i feed for that person your
[1:29:14] feeling must be gathered by the word of
[1:29:16] god
[1:29:19] it must stay in the confound of the word
[1:29:21] of god or else it will not be a blessing
[1:29:24] to you neither a blessing to that person
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:31] it must stay in the confines of god's
[1:29:33] word right
[1:29:47] i read this to you and then we bought
[1:29:49] our heads to pray sometimes
[1:29:52] we have a feeling
[1:29:55] but we want to carry that feeling
[1:29:58] into places
[1:30:00] if you don't watch
[1:30:02] the devil will take that feeling
[1:30:05] and pervert it into something
[1:30:09] but as long as you stay in the bible
[1:30:16] as long as you stay with the word
[1:30:21] praise the lord
[1:30:23] right
[1:30:25] you think about it brother branham says
[1:30:27] uh uh uh great about you ever thought
[1:30:29] sit on god eve by her reasoning
[1:30:32] yes
[1:30:34] but it was the same thing
[1:30:37] she was never taught to be careful
[1:30:40] adam never told her you got to be
[1:30:42] careful yeah you got she was never
[1:30:43] taught to be careful
[1:30:45] she loved all the animals the same
[1:31:14] praise the lord
[1:31:25] the only person that can be touched
[1:31:29] you might be going through something
[1:31:31] and when you share it with me
[1:31:34] i can
[1:31:37] i can tell you i know what you're going
[1:31:38] through
[1:31:39] i'm trying to put myself in your shoes
[1:31:43] but it's not like when our lord jesus
[1:31:45] christ is touched
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:51] he knows how every nails in your body is
[1:31:54] pulling
[1:31:56] he knows how every cell in your body
[1:31:59] is moving i don't know about that
[1:32:08] i can just be compassionate
[1:32:10] and try to process in my mind how did
[1:32:12] this happen how did you get here what's
[1:32:15] going on
[1:32:16] why you never told me not i can do all
[1:32:19] of that
[1:32:22] just to be able to put myself in a place
[1:32:24] where i can be able to
[1:32:27] to to be blessed by god to help you
[1:32:33] praise the lord
[1:32:34] but if you're going through something
[1:32:36] and you're dead and says well you know
[1:32:38] i've been going through this two months
[1:32:40] now the pastor has not called me how do
[1:32:42] you expect me to know
[1:32:43] right
[1:32:45] yeah exactly
[1:32:47] how you expect me to know
[1:32:57] praise the lord
