[47:31] I had a chorus on my mind uh
[47:36] foreign
[47:39] covered by the blood you know we sang
[47:41] the song cover me cover me so that song
[47:44] kept playing on my mind
[47:45] [Music]
[47:47] I am covered
[47:52] by his God
[47:55] I'm walking by faith
[48:11] Justified
[48:16] oh yes
[48:28] I am me
[48:32] oh I am covered I am covered
[48:46] one more time
[48:57] [Music]
[49:44] Jesus
[49:48] one more time
[49:58] what
[50:01] my face
[50:05] [Music]
[50:23] thank you
[50:24] mine
[50:26] hey man
[50:28] [Music]
[50:33] covered by his blood
[50:36] walking by faith
[50:38] living in love
[50:40] [Music]
[50:44] it's just such a beautiful thing
[50:47] you know
[50:49] you have to I don't know that the song
[50:52] reader was thinking about it when he
[50:53] wrote it
[50:55] but you have to have it in that order
[50:59] you see if you weren't covered by the
[51:01] blood it'd make it a whole lot harder to
[51:03] walk by faith
[51:05] but because you know you're covered by
[51:07] the blood
[51:09] you can walk by faith knowing no matter
[51:12] where you go he's leading you no matter
[51:14] what happens you have the covering of
[51:16] the blood over you you don't have to be
[51:19] afraid you don't have to worry about
[51:21] where you're going or what you might do
[51:24] because he's leading you and even if you
[51:27] might have a misstep even if you might
[51:29] backslide in some point you're covered
[51:32] by the blood
[51:34] but he looks down he still sees a sin
[51:37] the saint
[51:38] because when he looks down to the blood
[51:40] he doesn't see that he just sees the Son
[51:43] and Daughter of God
[51:44] and that's why you're living in love
[51:47] because his love just encapsulates
[51:49] around you say
[51:50] it's just beautiful
[51:52] it's just beautiful
[51:54] you can't help but
[51:57] love a God Like That
[52:00] my goodness my goodness
[52:04] it's just so wonderful to be back in
[52:07] service here with all of you and here on
[52:09] a Wednesday night like for the one said
[52:11] we're all watching the weather because
[52:13] the weather is doing what it wants
[52:16] and it's not sure if it wants to be
[52:19] winter or fall or or go back to Spring
[52:24] and uh
[52:26] it's just such a privilege to be here
[52:28] you know
[52:30] so many times I think
[52:32] we watch the weather for a lot of the
[52:35] times when we have obligations to things
[52:38] and sometimes we watch the weather and
[52:40] we see the weather get bad and we're
[52:41] like yes don't have to do that
[52:44] but I think
[52:46] you can take a look and oh I'm sure
[52:49] we've all had it on a Wednesday night
[52:50] you had a busy week and you know that
[52:54] back thought oh man you know whether
[52:56] maybe I don't have to go and I'm busy
[52:59] and that's a good excuse but I think in
[53:01] every son and daughter of God even on
[53:03] days like that there's something in you
[53:05] where you're like well whether or not
[53:07] I'm gonna go and only if the weather's
[53:09] real bad I'm going to stay home you know
[53:12] but there's something about it where
[53:15] you know you can come to the place in
[53:18] the house of God and it has nothing to
[53:20] do with the building but he instruct us
[53:23] to gather together to draw strength one
[53:25] from another
[53:26] he wanted us to come and and actually
[53:29] bring our experiences together that's
[53:33] why he sent them all to the upper room
[53:35] there in the day of Pentecost it wasn't
[53:38] because he couldn't have they couldn't
[53:39] have all been in their separate homes
[53:40] and he couldn't have got his omnipresent
[53:43] he could have met each of them right in
[53:46] the place where they were at if he
[53:47] wanted to
[53:48] but he wanted all of them to bring their
[53:50] flame together so that when it was lit
[53:53] on fire it'd be something so bright
[53:56] burning so like furiously that the
[54:00] people couldn't help but recognize it
[54:02] and see it and that's what happened on
[54:04] the day of Pentecost is when the fire
[54:07] the that little lick of tongue of fire
[54:10] on each and every individual was all in
[54:13] one place and it poured out onto the
[54:15] street the people couldn't help but
[54:16] notice and that's what it's about for
[54:19] each one of us when we come into service
[54:20] it's not because God couldn't meet us in
[54:23] our home or he couldn't meet us in a
[54:25] place by ourselves and there's times for
[54:28] that but God wants us to bring our
[54:31] little flames of fire and maybe some of
[54:33] us have got a Burning Flame that is nice
[54:36] and bright and is visible and everyone
[54:38] can feel it even some of us have just
[54:40] got a just a little bit of a spark left
[54:43] but if you bring that all together
[54:46] sooner soon enough when they all are put
[54:49] in the same room together they'll all
[54:51] burned at the same intensity you see
[54:54] that's what we're here for is so that
[54:56] those of us who are burning intensely
[54:58] then then help the one next to us
[55:01] because maybe their Sparks about to go
[55:02] out and rekindle that thing inside of
[55:05] them and the one who's and vice versa
[55:07] and we some of us some days are better
[55:10] than others for some of us and and
[55:13] someday we're the spark and someday
[55:14] we're the flame but God knew that it
[55:17] would be the way it would be and he said
[55:18] that's why go gather yourself together
[55:21] Rejoice around the word and share that
[55:24] flame together let's just go right to
[55:26] the word I'm going to let you guys sit
[55:28] down here
[55:30] um if we can oh I'm sorry I was talking
[55:32] to the Musicians
[55:33] um let's turn in our the scripture to
[55:35] Luke 15. I wasn't real clear there
[55:39] um
[55:40] got a little thought here and by God's
[55:43] grace we'll be able to share that and
[55:45] just speak from the heart
[55:46] Luke chapter 15
[55:49] 25-32 we'll read that and then and then
[55:52] I'll let everyone else sit down
[55:55] um
[55:56] and it reads like this
[55:59] now his Elder son was in the field
[56:03] and as he came and Drew Nye to the house
[56:05] he heard music and dancing
[56:08] and he called one of the servants and
[56:10] asked what these things meant
[56:13] and he said unto him thy brother is come
[56:15] and thy father have killed the fatted
[56:18] calf because he hath received him safe
[56:21] and sound
[56:23] and he was angry and would not go in
[56:25] therefore came his father out and
[56:27] entreated him and he answered ring saith
[56:31] to his father load these many years do I
[56:34] serve thee neither transgressed I at any
[56:37] time thy commandment yet thou never gave
[56:39] us me a kid that I might make Merry with
[56:42] my friends but as soon as thy son was
[56:45] come which hath devoured thy living with
[56:47] harlots thou has killed for him the
[56:50] fatted calf
[56:51] and he said unto him son thou art ever
[56:54] with me all that I have is thine
[56:58] it was meat that we should make Mary and
[57:00] be glad for thy brother was dead and is
[57:03] alive again was lost and has found let's
[57:06] pray Heavenly Father Lord we just ask
[57:09] you to come and take full control the
[57:11] service father Lord and just have your
[57:13] way we know you're here your presence is
[57:16] here for you said wherever two or three
[57:18] are gathered together in my name there I
[57:20] would be also Father and Lord the Saints
[57:23] have come they've gathered they've
[57:25] worshiped they've
[57:26] praised father Lord they've made
[57:30] themselves ready
[57:31] Lord and I've
[57:34] come and desire to set myself to the
[57:38] side father but or even in that I need
[57:41] you father so I ask you just come have
[57:44] your way set me to the side Lord and
[57:46] with this little thought if it's where
[57:50] you would want to go then father then
[57:52] may you make it a reality to the people
[57:54] and if it's not then Lord you just take
[57:56] us wherever you want father or we
[57:59] dedicate ourselves back to you asking
[58:01] that you'd come and have your way in
[58:03] Jesus name we pray amen you may be
[58:06] seated
[58:07] you know we're going to go ahead and
[58:10] turn to Luke 10.
[58:12] verse 38 through 42.
[58:18] Luke 10 38 through 42. and it reads now
[58:23] it came to pass as they went that he
[58:26] entered into a certain Village and a
[58:28] certain woman named Martha received him
[58:31] into her house
[58:32] and she had a sister called Mary which
[58:35] also sat at Jesus feet and heard his
[58:38] word
[58:39] but Martha was cumbered about much
[58:42] serving and came to him and said Lord
[58:45] Dost thou not care that my sister hath
[58:49] left me to serve alone bid heard
[58:51] therefore that she helped me
[58:53] and Jesus answered and said unto her
[58:56] Martha Martha Thou Art careful and
[59:00] troubled about many things
[59:03] but one thing is needful and Mary hath
[59:06] chosen that good part which shall not be
[59:09] taken away from her
[59:12] I want to take a little thought
[59:14] and if I was to give it a title I would
[59:17] call it the Sun that stayed
[59:20] in a relationship of familiarity
[59:24] no
[59:26] as you all know if you didn't catch it
[59:28] already is that that first scripture we
[59:30] read was actually about the Elder son
[59:32] and the story of The Prodigal Son
[59:36] right and I think that the prodigal son
[59:38] is usually the sun that's that's spoken
[59:41] about and taught on and if a preacher is
[59:43] going to preach he preached about that
[59:44] particle son the one who took the
[59:47] father's goods and went out into the
[59:49] world and squandered them away and and
[59:51] used them all up
[59:54] and then the Redemption of that sun
[59:56] coming back and the father going forth
[59:58] to meet him and and we all know that
[1:00:00] story so well
[1:00:02] but very rarely do you ever take time
[1:00:05] have I ever seen someone take time to
[1:00:07] take and and look at that Elder son
[1:00:11] you see the Elder son made no demands of
[1:00:13] the father
[1:00:15] like the younger son
[1:00:18] the Elder son caused no problems
[1:00:22] this guy was a worker
[1:00:25] in fact I think if you read the the
[1:00:29] story in Luke it says that the younger
[1:00:32] son came to the father and said give me
[1:00:34] that which is mine
[1:00:37] and then the next thing that happens is
[1:00:39] he takes that and walks away and
[1:00:42] I'm I'm gonna blink right now on whether
[1:00:44] or not this Parable is told in the other
[1:00:47] gospels but at least in Luke it never
[1:00:49] says
[1:00:51] that the eldest son came to the father
[1:00:53] and said well if you're giving him his
[1:00:54] give me mine also
[1:00:57] it doesn't
[1:00:59] so the younger son takes it and runs
[1:01:02] away and the Elder son just stays there
[1:01:04] and keeps on working keeps on working
[1:01:08] away
[1:01:10] and here
[1:01:11] the part that we're reading is here
[1:01:13] years and years later when the younger
[1:01:16] son comes back
[1:01:18] the father goes out to meet him he's
[1:01:20] rejoicing he's having a good time
[1:01:25] and the Elder son comes in from still
[1:01:28] working
[1:01:32] and he asked the servants
[1:01:34] said what's up with the party why didn't
[1:01:37] word I didn't hear anything we didn't
[1:01:39] have anything planned you know typically
[1:01:41] if there's something going on I I he was
[1:01:44] probably the one who planned most of the
[1:01:45] events if he was a worker
[1:01:48] if he was a doer the father probably
[1:01:51] didn't do much at all that's why he
[1:01:52] could stand out at the road watching for
[1:01:53] the younger son all the time because he
[1:01:56] had this responsible older son that
[1:01:59] taken on the father's business
[1:02:02] in every single way possible
[1:02:06] he was busy
[1:02:08] he put himself about the father's
[1:02:10] business in every way imaginable because
[1:02:12] he was working towards adoption
[1:02:16] he knew that in order to reach adoption
[1:02:19] you had to apply yourself in every
[1:02:24] aspect of the father's work
[1:02:26] so that eventually it will get turned
[1:02:29] over to you because the father would be
[1:02:31] so confident in your abilities and the
[1:02:34] work that you do
[1:02:36] and he said you know what
[1:02:38] he can just take it he can do it full
[1:02:41] responsibility whatever my son says that
[1:02:43] goes
[1:02:44] because I know the decision he'll make
[1:02:47] would be exactly the same as me so here
[1:02:51] this elder son has been working that
[1:02:53] whole time towards that pinnacle
[1:02:58] and so now he comes home after working
[1:03:01] again
[1:03:02] and he gets greeted by this party that
[1:03:04] he he didn't plan
[1:03:08] and so he says what's going on must have
[1:03:10] been a real something special for it to
[1:03:12] happen this quick and me not know about
[1:03:14] it
[1:03:15] and he calls one of the other servants
[1:03:16] from around the house and he said what's
[1:03:18] up
[1:03:20] what kind of what dignitary what world
[1:03:23] leader came in
[1:03:26] on the spur of the moment no planning
[1:03:28] that I didn't know about
[1:03:30] who is the special person
[1:03:32] what is the special event
[1:03:35] and he gets told oh well
[1:03:37] you know your younger brother
[1:03:40] the one who took away half the family
[1:03:41] fortune and ran off
[1:03:44] and uh
[1:03:46] used it all up having fun
[1:03:49] yeah he's back and your father threw him
[1:03:51] a party
[1:03:54] and he is so angry
[1:03:56] he is so angry
[1:04:00] because he says what is the point of all
[1:04:03] of this
[1:04:04] I stay here I don't ask for nothing I
[1:04:08] work night and day
[1:04:12] I don't ever get appreciated for the
[1:04:13] work I do
[1:04:18] and you're just standing out there
[1:04:20] and the father comes to him
[1:04:24] and
[1:04:25] I want to focus in on
[1:04:30] verse
[1:04:31] 31 of Luke 15.
[1:04:36] this
[1:04:38] this they had a very spirited
[1:04:40] conversation now it happened in one
[1:04:42] verse here where the father comes out
[1:04:44] and he asked him
[1:04:48] you know why is it you've never thrown
[1:04:50] me a party you've never done anything
[1:04:52] for me and my friends you've never done
[1:04:54] anything special for me
[1:04:57] and as soon as the son that has devoured
[1:05:03] thy living
[1:05:05] just just threw it away as soon as he
[1:05:08] came home you throw him a party
[1:05:11] and the father says
[1:05:14] to him
[1:05:15] son thou art ever with me and all that I
[1:05:21] have is thine
[1:05:26] now this is very sad
[1:05:30] this is extremely sad
[1:05:37] this very short verse thou art ever with
[1:05:41] me
[1:05:41] and all that I have is thine
[1:05:46] you see
[1:05:49] because
[1:05:51] this son
[1:05:54] this whole time was still living
[1:05:58] below his privileges
[1:06:01] as a son of the father
[1:06:04] in his the father's house
[1:06:08] because although he had put so much time
[1:06:10] and effort into laboring in the father's
[1:06:14] works
[1:06:16] he'd put very little time
[1:06:19] into actually getting to know the heart
[1:06:21] of the father
[1:06:26] and you may say well how do you know
[1:06:27] that
[1:06:29] is because
[1:06:31] the Son and the father here had a
[1:06:34] disconnect
[1:06:36] on who
[1:06:37] and
[1:06:39] on who everything belonged to
[1:06:43] you see and how do I know that is the
[1:06:45] father said everything that I have is
[1:06:48] thine
[1:06:49] but the son said you never gave me
[1:06:52] anything
[1:06:56] so that son had been working that whole
[1:06:59] time all those years and still to that
[1:07:02] very moment under the impression
[1:07:06] that nothing belonged to him
[1:07:08] and he had no rights with the father
[1:07:12] and the father this whole time
[1:07:15] he's probably since the younger son had
[1:07:18] left
[1:07:19] was under the impression and on the
[1:07:21] understanding all that I have is dying
[1:07:25] to doeth as you will
[1:07:30] now
[1:07:33] we'll come back to that
[1:07:35] in in Luke 10 we read about Martha
[1:07:38] in
[1:07:40] I don't want to focus in on it even on
[1:07:42] the same way that many people do and and
[1:07:45] many people they
[1:07:47] focus in on the part where Martha comes
[1:07:51] to Jesus and he said Lord why isn't Mary
[1:07:53] helping me and he says well Mary's doing
[1:07:55] that which is
[1:07:56] um
[1:08:00] that but one thing is needful and Mary
[1:08:03] has chosen that good part which shall
[1:08:05] not be taken away from her but I want to
[1:08:06] focus in on here's Martha if you go to
[1:08:09] the beginning of the first verse it says
[1:08:12] now it came to pass as they went that he
[1:08:15] entered a certain Village and a certain
[1:08:17] woman named Martha received him into her
[1:08:21] house
[1:08:23] so Martha was the one who recognized
[1:08:27] Jesus
[1:08:29] when he entered into the village
[1:08:31] and said ah
[1:08:34] I
[1:08:35] am going to purpose
[1:08:37] of myself
[1:08:39] to go out and invite Jesus into my home
[1:08:45] Mary reap the benefit
[1:08:48] of Martha's insight
[1:08:52] it doesn't say Mary
[1:08:54] went to invite Jesus into her house
[1:08:57] it doesn't even say Lazarus when invited
[1:09:00] Jesus into the house
[1:09:02] which during that time and custom it
[1:09:03] would have been more customary for a man
[1:09:07] to invite another man into his home
[1:09:11] but Martha was discerning
[1:09:15] and she was watchful
[1:09:17] of those coming and going in the village
[1:09:20] and when she saw Jesus she made it a
[1:09:22] point to go out there and say Jesus
[1:09:26] come to my home I want you to come and
[1:09:29] stay in my home
[1:09:33] and now under a a feeling of great
[1:09:36] responsibility
[1:09:37] of inviting and
[1:09:39] had Jesus Come into her home Martha goes
[1:09:43] to work
[1:09:45] she's taking care of Jesus she's taking
[1:09:48] care of the disciples she's taking care
[1:09:50] of everyone else who was could possibly
[1:09:53] have tried to squeeze into her home from
[1:09:55] the rest of the village and she's
[1:09:57] working
[1:10:00] she is serving the master in the best
[1:10:03] way she knows how
[1:10:06] she said there's no way I'm going to let
[1:10:07] Jesus Come into my home and not be
[1:10:09] refreshed
[1:10:10] there's no way that I'm going to let
[1:10:12] Jesus Come into my home and not take
[1:10:14] care of his people
[1:10:16] there's no way that this is ever going
[1:10:18] to happen but what when they leave
[1:10:21] they're going to say Martha
[1:10:23] took the best care of anyone
[1:10:26] of Jesus
[1:10:31] you see many times
[1:10:33] I think when people focus on it they
[1:10:35] want to point out that maybe Martha
[1:10:37] chose the wrong thing
[1:10:43] but it wasn't because Martha just didn't
[1:10:46] want to be there
[1:10:49] Martha loved him so much
[1:10:53] and was so committed to her Duty
[1:10:57] as a hostess
[1:11:02] that she put herself to work she didn't
[1:11:04] sit down for a second
[1:11:06] she went out she invited him in and went
[1:11:10] right to work to make sure that his stay
[1:11:12] was as good as it could possibly be
[1:11:25] no
[1:11:28] hold on to those two things
[1:11:32] and I want to just take you
[1:11:35] into our own lives
[1:11:37] because
[1:11:39] many times it's
[1:11:42] even as we begin to look at them it's
[1:11:45] very hard to take scriptural stories of
[1:11:49] people in the Bible and see ourselves
[1:11:53] especially if we've spent a lot of time
[1:11:54] reading these stories we know the
[1:11:56] stories we've heard them told backwards
[1:11:58] and forwards
[1:11:59] we know the names we know the dates we
[1:12:02] know the events that happened around it
[1:12:05] and their stories and their good stories
[1:12:07] but they're hard to relate to at times
[1:12:12] but I can tell you this from my personal
[1:12:14] experience
[1:12:16] and maybe you all can too
[1:12:20] but
[1:12:23] many times in
[1:12:26] loving showing love to those
[1:12:30] around us
[1:12:32] we get caught up in The Daily Grind
[1:12:36] of loving them
[1:12:39] and what do I mean by that well
[1:12:43] if you're
[1:12:45] someone you're married or
[1:12:48] you're a mother or father
[1:12:50] and even young people you have
[1:12:53] responsibilities to other people that
[1:12:55] you love
[1:12:57] but you won't know
[1:12:58] you won't know it quite the same until
[1:13:01] you move on to those next stages of life
[1:13:04] but many times we have responsibilities
[1:13:08] to work
[1:13:09] it's
[1:13:11] cleaning up and doing things around the
[1:13:13] house it's taking care of the kids
[1:13:15] it's
[1:13:17] making sure that everyone's taken care
[1:13:20] of
[1:13:21] watching out for the family's health
[1:13:25] it's
[1:13:26] all the little things you can think of
[1:13:31] that you do it day in and day out and
[1:13:34] you do it without even thinking and and
[1:13:36] and you would never ever even think of
[1:13:39] not doing it
[1:13:42] and it takes hours and hours out of your
[1:13:45] day and out of your life
[1:13:48] and you'll be in the middle of doing it
[1:13:51] and perhaps your wife or your husband
[1:13:55] will tell you
[1:13:56] something like
[1:13:58] I miss you
[1:14:02] and you're like
[1:14:03] what do you mean you miss me
[1:14:06] I just saw you this morning
[1:14:09] you'll be driving down the road in the
[1:14:10] car and they'll say I miss you you're
[1:14:13] like what do you mean
[1:14:15] I'm sitting right here you're sitting
[1:14:16] right there how is it possible that you
[1:14:19] could miss me
[1:14:22] we're in each other's presence right now
[1:14:27] but that's not what they mean
[1:14:31] and I'm driving at something
[1:14:33] I'm driving at something
[1:14:37] is that
[1:14:39] when we get caught up in the busyness
[1:14:43] same thing they'll say do you love me
[1:14:45] you know like you'll say of course I
[1:14:47] love you
[1:14:50] it's like
[1:14:53] don't you see all the things I do for
[1:14:55] you
[1:14:55] don't you see all the things I do for
[1:14:57] the family it's because I love you
[1:15:00] and they say yeah but do you love me
[1:15:06] you see because we get so caught up in
[1:15:09] serving each other
[1:15:11] in in the works
[1:15:13] of life
[1:15:16] that we miss out on the relationship
[1:15:22] is that we get so caught up
[1:15:25] in
[1:15:26] the works of maintaining that
[1:15:29] relationship that we lose out on the
[1:15:32] connection
[1:15:38] and these are things that happen to all
[1:15:40] of us in all different walks of life
[1:15:42] whether it's
[1:15:44] with
[1:15:46] loved ones with friends with relatives
[1:15:52] but you get so caught up in doing the
[1:15:56] works
[1:15:58] and you say you see I do these works
[1:16:00] because I love you
[1:16:04] but their
[1:16:06] feeling of love is so empty
[1:16:12] because you haven't taken time to
[1:16:14] connect with them on a personal level
[1:16:20] and that's what we're seeing in these
[1:16:22] two stories
[1:16:26] this is what we're seeing this is has so
[1:16:30] many more moving Parts than if we just
[1:16:31] read it quickly and pass on
[1:16:34] this father and son
[1:16:38] the father is here he's saying son
[1:16:41] all that I have was is dying
[1:16:45] of course I love you
[1:16:46] I've always loved you
[1:16:48] I've loved you the most the whole time
[1:16:50] everything I've had since then has been
[1:16:53] yours and is yours now
[1:16:55] I don't own anything it's all yours son
[1:16:59] but the son never knew it
[1:17:03] the son never knew it
[1:17:05] he was so busy working for the father
[1:17:11] that he never even really knew the
[1:17:13] Father's Love
[1:17:17] and that was even the thing with Martha
[1:17:19] here
[1:17:21] Martha she loved the Lord
[1:17:24] and the Lord loved her
[1:17:27] but what he wanted to do is say Martha
[1:17:30] he didn't say Martha what you're doing
[1:17:31] is bad
[1:17:34] he never said that
[1:17:36] we need people who can work and do
[1:17:39] things and help the body and there's
[1:17:42] people working in the back tonight
[1:17:45] there was a musicians up here they were
[1:17:47] working
[1:17:49] the Deacon in the back who's watching
[1:17:51] and you know he's still in the building
[1:17:53] but he's watching off a monitor he's not
[1:17:55] in the sanctuary he doesn't get the same
[1:17:57] feeling with the worship
[1:17:59] those who have to go out and maybe every
[1:18:01] once in a while walk the parking lot and
[1:18:02] make sure everything's okay
[1:18:05] we need people who can do that these are
[1:18:07] not bad things
[1:18:09] we need people who can clean the church
[1:18:12] and are willing to put their shoulders
[1:18:14] of the wheel and come and help with the
[1:18:16] yard and and clear snow from time to
[1:18:20] time
[1:18:21] these are good things
[1:18:24] but many times just like in our personal
[1:18:28] relationships
[1:18:29] we get so caught up
[1:18:33] in working to prove our love
[1:18:38] we forget about the relationship
[1:18:41] because our works are taking up so much
[1:18:43] of our time
[1:18:45] The Works are not bad
[1:18:47] The Works are good
[1:18:50] we know if you go into the Book of James
[1:18:51] he says if you show me
[1:18:55] show me your faith by your show me your
[1:18:58] works
[1:18:59] he said your Works will show me your
[1:19:01] faith
[1:19:04] so there is an aspect to that
[1:19:06] but I think it's so easy in today's day
[1:19:09] and age
[1:19:10] to get caught up
[1:19:13] in the works
[1:19:16] because we're so disconnected
[1:19:20] from the relationship
[1:19:23] and you find in life
[1:19:26] is that the further you get disconnected
[1:19:28] in a relationship
[1:19:30] the more you'll pour yourself into the
[1:19:32] works to fill the void
[1:19:34] and you don't realize that if you just
[1:19:37] take a few moments
[1:19:39] to set down
[1:19:41] with that other individual
[1:19:43] with that person that you feel like
[1:19:45] you're struggling with
[1:19:48] because you love them
[1:19:51] but you feel like every time you get
[1:19:52] together there's just
[1:19:54] there's a clashing the gears don't mesh
[1:19:57] right
[1:20:00] you think well I'm doing all these
[1:20:01] things for them and can't they see that
[1:20:04] and they're thinking on the other side
[1:20:05] I'm doing all these things for them and
[1:20:07] can't they see that why don't they just
[1:20:09] want to spend time with me
[1:20:17] and you come together and because the
[1:20:19] relationship is out of sync
[1:20:23] then instead of meshing together
[1:20:27] it grinds
[1:20:29] how many of you have ever driven a
[1:20:32] manual transmission or been in a vehicle
[1:20:34] with a manual transmission
[1:20:36] yeah have you ever been in it with
[1:20:38] someone who's just learning how to drive
[1:20:40] it
[1:20:43] and they go to get started or they're
[1:20:47] shifting from the stoplight from first
[1:20:49] to second and all you hear is
[1:20:52] right
[1:20:54] there ain't nothing wrong with the
[1:20:55] vehicle
[1:20:57] there's nothing wrong with the
[1:20:58] transmission
[1:20:59] there's nothing wrong with the moving
[1:21:01] part the working moving parts of that
[1:21:03] vehicle
[1:21:05] the problem is with the relationship
[1:21:07] between the driver and the vehicle
[1:21:11] is that the driver does not have a close
[1:21:14] enough under working relationship with
[1:21:17] that vehicle
[1:21:18] to make those gears mesh appropriately
[1:21:22] and that's exactly what happens in life
[1:21:26] is that
[1:21:27] it's not that there's anything wrong
[1:21:29] with the the moving vehicle
[1:21:31] is it not that there was anything wrong
[1:21:33] with the work the workings
[1:21:37] but because the relationship is out of
[1:21:39] sync
[1:21:41] then even though it's all the right
[1:21:42] things in the right place
[1:21:44] the timing is off
[1:21:48] you see that
[1:21:53] and this happens between
[1:21:56] husbands and wives this happens between
[1:21:59] Fathers and Sons
[1:22:01] daughters
[1:22:03] and mothers
[1:22:07] parents in general
[1:22:10] in fact the busier you get and the more
[1:22:12] obligated you feel the more likely it is
[1:22:15] to happen
[1:22:18] because you feel like you're doing what
[1:22:20] you should be doing
[1:22:22] to just keep this thing moving
[1:22:25] if I stop if I take a second's breath if
[1:22:29] I it's all going to fall apart
[1:22:32] and can't
[1:22:34] each one of us is thinking can't they
[1:22:36] just see I'm doing the best I can
[1:22:39] and the reason why I'm doing the best I
[1:22:41] can is because I love them
[1:22:44] and then when we have these moments in
[1:22:47] life where it clashes
[1:22:51] we feel unloved
[1:22:57] now I'm driving at something I'm driving
[1:23:01] at something here
[1:23:04] is
[1:23:06] perhaps if we can recognize it on a
[1:23:08] personal level
[1:23:10] on relationships that we see every day
[1:23:14] then we can apply it to our relationship
[1:23:16] with our heavenly father
[1:23:23] if we can turn to Luke 21
[1:23:29] verse
[1:23:30] 34-36 I believe
[1:23:46] it says take heed to yourselves lest at
[1:23:50] any time your heart be overcharged with
[1:23:53] surfacing and drunkenness
[1:23:56] and the cares of this life
[1:23:59] so that day
[1:24:01] so that day come upon you unawares
[1:24:04] for as a snare shall it come on all them
[1:24:07] that dwell on the face
[1:24:09] of the whole Earth
[1:24:12] watch ye therefore and pray always that
[1:24:16] ye may be accounted worthy to escape all
[1:24:19] these things that shall come to pass and
[1:24:22] stand before the son of man what I want
[1:24:26] to focus on this is on verse 34.
[1:24:32] and it says take heed to yourself less
[1:24:35] any times your hearts be overcharged and
[1:24:38] I'm going to skip the first two and just
[1:24:40] go to the cares by the cares of this
[1:24:43] life
[1:24:45] so that the day may come upon you
[1:24:47] unawares
[1:24:49] now
[1:24:51] when we read this the beginning and it
[1:24:53] it says surfing and many of us including
[1:24:55] myself wouldn't know what the term
[1:24:57] surfing means off the top of my head so
[1:24:59] I'm going to assume it's something
[1:25:00] horrible
[1:25:01] it's not really I looked it up briefly
[1:25:04] and it just says that
[1:25:06] it basically implies there's a lot of
[1:25:08] things taking up your time
[1:25:11] and drunkenness
[1:25:13] and drunkenness you could
[1:25:16] you can either take it as actual
[1:25:18] drunkenness by way of alcohol or maybe
[1:25:21] there's something else
[1:25:24] that is intoxicating in your life
[1:25:28] that is causing a distraction
[1:25:30] and distorting your judgment
[1:25:35] okay but I don't even want I don't need
[1:25:38] to focus on those I want to focus on the
[1:25:40] cares of this life
[1:25:44] you see because the cares of this life
[1:25:46] is not a sin
[1:25:51] we all have cares of life
[1:25:53] daily cares of life
[1:25:56] we set the alarm in the morning
[1:25:59] we get up we go into our job it's a care
[1:26:02] of life brushing your teeth is a care of
[1:26:05] life
[1:26:07] maintaining your health is a care of
[1:26:10] life
[1:26:12] everything
[1:26:13] every little thing think about it
[1:26:15] everything you have to care about to
[1:26:17] stay living is a care of life
[1:26:23] The Works in and around this church
[1:26:27] are cares of life
[1:26:33] the things that need to be done
[1:26:36] and someone needs to do them
[1:26:39] so that things stay working
[1:26:44] your daily works
[1:26:48] and your routines
[1:26:50] are cares of life
[1:26:53] now let me
[1:26:54] step out a little bit
[1:26:57] and take one more step
[1:27:00] all of your routines in life
[1:27:04] would be related to your cares of life
[1:27:09] you know many of us have very good
[1:27:11] routines
[1:27:13] and those routines could even be things
[1:27:16] like I have a routine
[1:27:19] of perhaps you say I have a routine of
[1:27:21] every morning I get up and the first
[1:27:23] thing I do
[1:27:24] is I open my bible and I make sure to
[1:27:27] read
[1:27:28] three to five verses every morning
[1:27:32] before I do anything else
[1:27:34] that's my routine
[1:27:37] now that is a very good thing to do
[1:27:44] but something to ask yourself
[1:27:46] is that still part of your relationship
[1:27:50] or has it become a part of your works
[1:27:58] you see
[1:28:01] because it's a very good thing to do
[1:28:03] it's a wonderful thing to do in fact
[1:28:05] brother Branham said if you want to get
[1:28:07] closer with the Lord
[1:28:09] you want more Revelation how do you do
[1:28:11] it
[1:28:12] read your Bible and pray every day
[1:28:20] so right away we know this is a good
[1:28:23] thing to do
[1:28:24] this is something we should do this is
[1:28:26] something we've been instructed to do
[1:28:30] but in the busyness of our life
[1:28:33] is this still something that we're doing
[1:28:34] because it's something that we do to
[1:28:38] help grow our relationship with Jesus
[1:28:41] Christ
[1:28:42] or to prove our love
[1:28:46] has become a work that we maintain
[1:28:56] it's the same as all the other things
[1:28:58] you might think you're doing for the
[1:29:00] Lord
[1:29:01] because as soon as you you change it
[1:29:04] from Lord I'm doing this because I want
[1:29:07] to get grow closer to you
[1:29:09] to in your brain it becomes Lord
[1:29:13] I'm doing this for you
[1:29:16] and not I'm doing this for you
[1:29:19] in a way that for both of us
[1:29:23] but I am doing this for you so you can
[1:29:25] see I'm doing something for you
[1:29:28] because that's when it becomes a work
[1:29:32] now you're working at it
[1:29:36] to prove to the father
[1:29:38] you're worthy of him
[1:29:44] and the minute becomes a work
[1:29:46] you lose the benefit
[1:29:52] because it was meant for a relationship
[1:29:59] just like time spent with a significant
[1:30:02] other or a spouse
[1:30:04] if you come together and every time you
[1:30:06] come together
[1:30:07] the next time something comes up you say
[1:30:10] well what was the point of us going on
[1:30:11] that date or what was the point of us
[1:30:13] spending that time together I did that
[1:30:15] for you
[1:30:18] thank you
[1:30:23] then you did it for the wrong reason
[1:30:27] you're doing a work
[1:30:29] to prove to the other person Your Love
[1:30:33] and now you're holding that over them
[1:30:37] as something you did for them and not
[1:30:39] something you did for
[1:30:42] you and not something you did for the
[1:30:44] relationship
[1:30:47] and many times we find ourselves in that
[1:30:49] same place with the Lord is the minute
[1:30:51] something starts going wrong or the
[1:30:53] minute perhaps we're that we're up for
[1:30:55] that promotion at work
[1:30:57] and you go and you start to pray you
[1:30:59] don't say Lord your will be done you say
[1:31:01] Lord
[1:31:03] I spend all this time in in devotions
[1:31:05] and I do all these works for the church
[1:31:08] and I do this and I play music and I
[1:31:12] sing specials to bless the people I
[1:31:15] deserve this
[1:31:17] you cheapen
[1:31:19] all those things
[1:31:22] from a relationship
[1:31:24] to works that you believe that you have
[1:31:27] a right to claim rewards off of
[1:31:33] it's so subtle
[1:31:37] and the devil does that on purpose he
[1:31:41] tries to speed us up that's where we're
[1:31:43] at in this day and age
[1:31:45] is the reason why it's so sped up
[1:31:48] and moving so fast
[1:31:51] is that the devil doesn't want to give
[1:31:53] us even a second to slow down and think
[1:31:58] about why am I doing this
[1:32:03] you see the this old Elder son the whole
[1:32:06] time he was working so hard
[1:32:10] he was putting in so much time in fact
[1:32:12] when he came in it was already dark
[1:32:15] that night
[1:32:17] he stayed out in the field all day
[1:32:23] managing the estate
[1:32:26] working for the father
[1:32:30] trying to win The Father's Love and
[1:32:34] approval
[1:32:35] not realizing it that he had it the
[1:32:38] whole time
[1:32:44] and many times that's where we we find
[1:32:46] ourselves
[1:32:49] is at the beginning of our relationship
[1:32:51] with the Lord we
[1:32:54] he comes and he saves us he justifies us
[1:32:57] we go through sanctification
[1:33:00] we get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:33:03] Jesus Christ
[1:33:05] oh we come out of that water and we feel
[1:33:07] like we're we're walking on clouds I can
[1:33:10] still remember it today
[1:33:12] I can remember the experience
[1:33:18] I felt like I was walking on clouds and
[1:33:22] nothing could go wrong for at least two
[1:33:24] weeks straight
[1:33:26] like I had a bounce in my step
[1:33:28] it was wonderful
[1:33:34] But as time goes on we forget that
[1:33:38] we forget what that relationship's
[1:33:39] supposed to feel like and I'm not saying
[1:33:42] every day your life is going to feel
[1:33:44] that way
[1:33:45] sometimes the Lord lets us go through
[1:33:47] things
[1:33:50] but sometimes we just get caught in the
[1:33:52] motions
[1:33:53] of coming to church of reading our Bible
[1:33:55] of we got to be in service by a certain
[1:33:58] time we got to have a certain level of
[1:34:00] devotion we got to make sure this is
[1:34:02] done in a certain way we got to make
[1:34:04] sure that the order is in in such a
[1:34:06] certain way and we got to make sure that
[1:34:09] each thing is done in special and and in
[1:34:13] its place and you know
[1:34:16] and those are all good things
[1:34:22] but are we
[1:34:24] slowly but surely finding ourself in the
[1:34:27] place of this elder son
[1:34:32] where we feel like we have to do the
[1:34:35] work because we know in our heart
[1:34:38] that the relationship is lacking
[1:34:41] so we'll go do the work because we're in
[1:34:43] a routine
[1:34:44] and if we're like okay I did that I did
[1:34:47] that part now okay
[1:34:49] I feel I went to church on Wednesday and
[1:34:53] I felt like I was an integral part of
[1:34:54] the service and I fell asleep with a few
[1:34:57] people and I shook a few hands and I
[1:34:59] said God bless you I did my work for the
[1:35:03] week and now I can breathe again and
[1:35:05] I'll make it till Sunday
[1:35:07] no we don't think this in our
[1:35:10] we don't actually think this out loud
[1:35:13] but that's a in our spirit that's what's
[1:35:16] going on
[1:35:20] is we're making it from day to day from
[1:35:24] work to work
[1:35:27] not realizing that we're missing out on
[1:35:29] a relationship the whole time
[1:35:32] and that's where Martha found herself
[1:35:35] too
[1:35:38] is Jesus didn't call her out
[1:35:41] in telling her that Mary had chosen the
[1:35:45] better part because he wanted to shame
[1:35:47] her
[1:35:54] he was saying Martha
[1:35:56] take a minute
[1:35:57] I appreciate all you do
[1:36:01] I appreciate you inviting me to your
[1:36:03] home
[1:36:04] but after you invited me in
[1:36:06] it'd be nice to spend some time with you
[1:36:10] I came here because you invited me
[1:36:13] I came to spend time with you
[1:36:16] and I haven't got a moment to spend with
[1:36:18] you since I got here
[1:36:19] you've been so busy trying to please me
[1:36:25] you haven't spent one moment with me
[1:36:30] you're so busy
[1:36:33] trying to do all the things you think
[1:36:35] will make me happy
[1:36:37] you think Will Curry my favor and and
[1:36:41] be worthy of my love
[1:36:44] when you don't have to do any of those
[1:36:45] things
[1:36:47] to Curry favor or be worthy of my love
[1:36:49] your word your I already you're already
[1:36:52] have my favor
[1:36:54] I already love you now I just want to
[1:36:57] spend some actual time with you
[1:37:02] you see
[1:37:03] because we could sit down and you could
[1:37:06] have that time where you sit down and
[1:37:08] read that certain number of verses
[1:37:11] but if you've locked it in as I needed
[1:37:13] to read so many chapters or I need to
[1:37:14] read so many verses to to have
[1:37:16] accomplished my devotion
[1:37:19] I say you're probably missing out at
[1:37:22] some point
[1:37:23] it's going to start out real nice
[1:37:27] but as you get focused in and locked in
[1:37:30] on the routine
[1:37:32] you're going to lose focus on the
[1:37:34] relationship
[1:37:36] because there will be times and maybe
[1:37:39] the relation in the relationship you'll
[1:37:41] read a whole chapter and God will use
[1:37:43] that chapter to speak to you
[1:37:45] and there'll be other times or he'll
[1:37:47] want you to stop on the first verse and
[1:37:50] go back and read it again and read it
[1:37:52] one more time and then just sit there
[1:37:54] and just bask in his presence as he just
[1:37:57] begins revealing it to your heart as you
[1:38:00] begin speaking to you through that verse
[1:38:03] but if you're so focused I got to read
[1:38:05] the whole chapter and
[1:38:07] speed reading
[1:38:09] you know it reminds me when I was
[1:38:10] growing up I was homeschooled and uh
[1:38:12] every morning before we started school
[1:38:14] we would have Bible you know and we'd
[1:38:18] all sit down around the table or in the
[1:38:19] living room and each of us would read a
[1:38:21] verse around whatever scriptures we were
[1:38:24] reading at the time from the youngest to
[1:38:26] the oldest I remember we were going
[1:38:28] through the book of Exodus at one point
[1:38:29] and my younger sister just younger than
[1:38:32] me at the time she was probably
[1:38:34] four or five years old so she could read
[1:38:37] a few small words here and there but she
[1:38:38] was not that good but almost every
[1:38:40] chapter in the book of Exodus starts
[1:38:42] what the Lord spoke unto Moses
[1:38:45] so the first verse was always hers to
[1:38:48] read and she wasn't reading it she had
[1:38:51] memorized
[1:38:52] how that chapter should start so it was
[1:38:55] always as the Lord spoke unto Moses and
[1:38:57] then he'd go on to the next person so
[1:38:58] she was so proud of that
[1:39:01] but I remember one time
[1:39:04] we were allowed to each one of us pick a
[1:39:08] scripture to read
[1:39:10] and I was
[1:39:12] I was doing fairly well at reading I was
[1:39:15] pretty proud of myself with the fact
[1:39:17] and
[1:39:18] in Sunday school at the time we would do
[1:39:20] speed drills
[1:39:22] and so being really fast was really
[1:39:24] important and also something I was very
[1:39:25] proud of at the time
[1:39:27] a lot of Pride going on there
[1:39:30] um
[1:39:31] and
[1:39:33] so
[1:39:34] I picked Psalms 119.
[1:39:39] and I read it in under five minutes out
[1:39:42] loud
[1:39:43] as fast as I could go
[1:39:47] you know what
[1:39:49] I don't think me or anyone else got
[1:39:52] anything out of that scripture reading
[1:39:56] and I say that and it's it's funny
[1:39:59] but sometimes that's how we are
[1:40:02] is that we feel like we have an
[1:40:05] obligation to a certain parameter or a
[1:40:08] certain amount of information we have to
[1:40:10] consume
[1:40:12] because that's the spirit of the age
[1:40:14] that's what's going on right now if you
[1:40:16] want to stay on top of things if you
[1:40:17] want to stay up with the current times
[1:40:19] it's the speed at which you can consume
[1:40:21] information
[1:40:23] and sometimes we consume information so
[1:40:25] fast there we don't even bother to stop
[1:40:28] and check whether the information we're
[1:40:29] consuming is even correct
[1:40:31] and then we go running off when we share
[1:40:33] it with someone else and we share it
[1:40:34] with someone else and someone else and
[1:40:36] it's not till we get to the third or
[1:40:37] fourth person that they're like that
[1:40:39] that that's not not a true story did you
[1:40:42] bother to double check it he's like no
[1:40:44] oh yeah that was completely made up
[1:40:47] you've been duped
[1:40:50] and that's what we do in our spiritual
[1:40:53] life sometimes
[1:40:55] is that we get such a hurry and we want
[1:40:58] we know I got need to read so many
[1:41:00] verses I need to listen to so much of a
[1:41:02] message I need to whatever it is
[1:41:04] whatever
[1:41:05] parameters you've put around your works
[1:41:10] did you jump in there and like I did
[1:41:12] when I read Psalms 119 because I know
[1:41:15] okay I got up late or I'm I'm
[1:41:18] and I need to leave for work really fast
[1:41:19] but I still need to do this before I go
[1:41:21] or you know I need to go to bed and I
[1:41:24] need to read it real quickly so I can
[1:41:25] fall asleep
[1:41:26] we jump in there and we try and read it
[1:41:29] as fast as we can or listen as quick as
[1:41:31] we can or or now we're not really
[1:41:34] listening but you're reading ahead on
[1:41:35] the message as fast as you can on your
[1:41:37] phone so you can finish the two so many
[1:41:39] paragraphs
[1:41:42] so when someone asks you yep that's what
[1:41:43] I did
[1:41:45] I read
[1:41:46] two chapters I listened to 20 minutes
[1:41:49] Worth or I read so many paragraphs every
[1:41:51] day wow brother that's really good thank
[1:41:54] you
[1:41:55] that's that's how we feel
[1:41:58] but then they say well but what is the
[1:42:01] Lord have been speak how's the Lord been
[1:42:03] speaking to you and you're like
[1:42:05] well
[1:42:07] I read such and such a chapter in such a
[1:42:10] such a verse
[1:42:12] that's not what they asked you though
[1:42:15] they said how has the Lord been speaking
[1:42:18] to you
[1:42:21] because if you do a work
[1:42:23] you'll memorize it because it's a part
[1:42:26] of the work
[1:42:28] or you'll commit it
[1:42:30] and you want to prove to someone that
[1:42:31] you did your work
[1:42:33] right like being in school you want to
[1:42:36] be able to prove you did your work so
[1:42:37] you can get the good grade
[1:42:39] and that's how we begin to treat it
[1:42:42] as a work
[1:42:44] where we're looking to submit it just so
[1:42:47] we can get the grade
[1:42:50] and it's not about that
[1:42:53] it's about an understanding it's about
[1:42:56] the relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:42:59] where he wants to pull us away from
[1:43:01] getting caught up in the spirit of this
[1:43:03] age where we're just running and rushing
[1:43:06] to get things done
[1:43:07] he would rather you if you have five
[1:43:10] minutes
[1:43:10] take that five minutes
[1:43:12] and say Lord speak to me from this verse
[1:43:15] here
[1:43:17] read the verse
[1:43:18] and say Lord speak to me and take that
[1:43:21] few minutes to just let him move on the
[1:43:23] scene
[1:43:24] quiet your spirit
[1:43:27] and let him do something for you
[1:43:31] because when he sent the disciples out
[1:43:34] in the book of Acts
[1:43:37] he didn't tell him go memorize as much
[1:43:40] as the scripture as you can as fast as
[1:43:42] you can
[1:43:45] he never did
[1:43:47] in fact most of them
[1:43:49] were ignorant and unlearned the
[1:43:53] scripture says
[1:43:55] they'd never even read the scripture
[1:43:58] personally themselves
[1:44:01] they couldn't open it up and read to you
[1:44:04] well here's the quote of the prophet
[1:44:07] they couldn't
[1:44:10] Jesus told them
[1:44:12] have a relationship with me so
[1:44:15] personally
[1:44:17] that when you're called before the Kings
[1:44:19] and magistrates and between before the
[1:44:22] high priest
[1:44:24] he said don't worry
[1:44:26] I will give you the things to say
[1:44:30] and you know what the result of that was
[1:44:34] it wasn't that the Jews and the
[1:44:36] Pharisees or the Kings and the people
[1:44:38] they came before said wow he really
[1:44:40] knows his Bible
[1:44:42] wow he really knows the the message of
[1:44:45] the Prophet Moses line for line man he's
[1:44:48] like a Pharisee
[1:44:50] I'm not using that as an insult in this
[1:44:53] case that would be it
[1:44:55] quite the
[1:44:57] honor
[1:44:59] because the Pharisees and Sadducees and
[1:45:02] the scholars of their day not only could
[1:45:04] they read it
[1:45:06] not only did they know it but they knew
[1:45:08] it so well and the Scrolls were rolled
[1:45:11] up in such a way
[1:45:12] they could take a pin
[1:45:15] push it through the scroll and tell you
[1:45:17] what verses and letters it hit as it
[1:45:19] passed through
[1:45:22] yet they're the ones who cried crucify
[1:45:26] and sent him to the cross
[1:45:29] scripture tells us this as he was on the
[1:45:32] cross
[1:45:33] they were in the temple quoting the
[1:45:36] Psalms
[1:45:38] of him being on the cross
[1:45:43] their Works were so intense
[1:45:48] and they thought they were proving their
[1:45:50] love to God
[1:45:52] through their works
[1:45:54] it's a religious spirit
[1:45:56] and it's never changed
[1:45:58] if you even follow it through and it's
[1:46:00] not even specific to Christianity
[1:46:04] a religious spirit
[1:46:06] will outwork anybody else any day of the
[1:46:09] week
[1:46:10] you can't beat it
[1:46:15] it's even it's going to be one that will
[1:46:17] bring all you to even
[1:46:21] acknowledge all your faults
[1:46:25] and then it'll give you a work
[1:46:28] to do to try and
[1:46:30] save yourself
[1:46:33] from those faults
[1:46:36] because you don't have a relationship
[1:46:38] with Jesus Christ
[1:46:41] because if you did
[1:46:43] and you are doing all these works and
[1:46:45] you had the relationship
[1:46:47] as you were memorizing the scripture
[1:46:49] you'd realize he'd already paid the
[1:46:51] price
[1:46:53] but when you call get caught up in your
[1:46:55] works
[1:46:57] and this isn't just a religious thing
[1:47:00] for those who are denominations but we
[1:47:03] ourselves get caught up in this
[1:47:07] is that we get caught up in our works
[1:47:11] and then we do something
[1:47:13] and we think we can outwork our faults
[1:47:18] and we just pour ourselves into those
[1:47:20] works and you know if God will just see
[1:47:22] how how much I I love him because of
[1:47:25] what I'm doing and he's just down to the
[1:47:27] side said if you just sit down and talk
[1:47:28] to me for a minute we could talk this
[1:47:30] out and you'd realize that there was no
[1:47:31] problem at all
[1:47:34] but you're so focused on fixing it
[1:47:36] yourself
[1:47:37] you're so focused on working it out
[1:47:43] that you don't even know who I am
[1:47:47] you don't even know what the what the
[1:47:49] the work of Calvary was all about you're
[1:47:53] so busy doing your own works you have no
[1:47:56] idea what the works of the father were
[1:47:58] for you already
[1:48:02] you don't realize you don't need
[1:48:04] those Works to prove Your Love
[1:48:08] because he's already done the work
[1:48:12] he wants to create a relationship with
[1:48:14] you because as you create a relationship
[1:48:18] you and the father will become one
[1:48:21] as you and the father become one in mind
[1:48:24] and heart
[1:48:25] you'll become one indeed also
[1:48:29] and now he's not trying to chase you
[1:48:31] around did you do that did you do this
[1:48:34] you'll find this in in relationships too
[1:48:38] you'll find in a home where the mother
[1:48:40] and father
[1:48:42] have a relationship where they truly
[1:48:44] love each other
[1:48:47] you won't hear
[1:48:50] someone always chatting hey did you did
[1:48:53] you take out the trash who's the last
[1:48:55] person
[1:48:55] don't you know you're supposed to be
[1:48:56] doing that
[1:48:59] why don't you ever help me around the
[1:49:00] house
[1:49:01] no
[1:49:03] it won't
[1:49:05] you know why
[1:49:06] because they love each other
[1:49:10] and when two people love each other they
[1:49:12] grow in sync
[1:49:14] when they spend time on the relationship
[1:49:16] they grow in sync
[1:49:21] and we can see what the example of
[1:49:23] growing in sync because of a
[1:49:25] relationship of love will do one for the
[1:49:28] other not just from the scripture but a
[1:49:31] prophet of our age
[1:49:33] you say how do I know this
[1:49:35] is brother Branham
[1:49:38] with the limited amount of time that he
[1:49:40] had with his family
[1:49:42] showed us exactly how that would work on
[1:49:46] a home
[1:49:50] is that when the home was in chaos and
[1:49:53] everyone was upset and the whole place
[1:49:55] was all stirred up
[1:49:57] he walked in
[1:49:58] he didn't start correcting nobody he
[1:50:00] didn't start tossing out thus saith the
[1:50:02] Lord and you better do as you're told
[1:50:05] I'm a prophet of God
[1:50:07] none of that
[1:50:13] it says he went into the kitchen
[1:50:16] where there was a mess
[1:50:18] where there was a bunch of dirty dishes
[1:50:20] and he put on an apron
[1:50:23] and he started washing the dishes and
[1:50:25] singing to himself
[1:50:29] he didn't even try and go tell anyone
[1:50:31] how they should live better or tell the
[1:50:34] boys how they should stop fighting he
[1:50:36] didn't he didn't tell anyone any of
[1:50:37] those things
[1:50:41] but there was such a relationship in the
[1:50:43] home
[1:50:46] that he didn't do the works to prove his
[1:50:48] love but his love drove him to the works
[1:50:54] you see that is the relationship that as
[1:50:57] you build a relationship with Jesus
[1:50:59] Christ
[1:51:00] you don't have to worry
[1:51:02] if you really fall in love
[1:51:05] all the things that he said are a
[1:51:07] representation of his love you won't be
[1:51:09] able to help but do them
[1:51:13] if I say focus in on the relationship
[1:51:16] first so that you don't find yourself
[1:51:19] like this son like you don't find
[1:51:22] yourself like Mary
[1:51:24] all worked out
[1:51:26] and in a tizzy all worked out and tired
[1:51:30] and saying Lord why doesn't anybody help
[1:51:32] me
[1:51:33] can't they see all the work I'm doing
[1:51:36] he's saying yeah
[1:51:38] they can see it and I see it too
[1:51:41] but what I'd really like is if you just
[1:51:43] spend some time with me
[1:51:58] in Mark chapter 10
[1:52:01] we're actually going to skip this is the
[1:52:03] story of the Rich Young Ruler and we all
[1:52:06] know it but I want to just jump straight
[1:52:07] to verse 24.
[1:52:12] it says and the disciples were
[1:52:14] astonished at his words
[1:52:17] but Jesus answereth again and say it to
[1:52:19] them children how hard is it for them
[1:52:22] that trust enriches to enter into the
[1:52:27] kingdom of God
[1:52:28] now
[1:52:30] riches we would like to all immediately
[1:52:32] read that and disassociate ourselves
[1:52:36] like well I ain't got no riches
[1:52:42] so that doesn't apply to me but I
[1:52:45] thought I would apply a
[1:52:46] a term
[1:52:48] that maybe more of us would recognize
[1:52:51] and I would say that those that trust
[1:52:54] in the hustle of life
[1:52:57] right bring it bring it to more modern
[1:53:00] times
[1:53:03] those who Trust
[1:53:05] in the hustle of life
[1:53:09] it's hard for them to enter into the
[1:53:11] kingdom of God
[1:53:15] because they're so busy doing it
[1:53:18] themselves
[1:53:19] see that was the the problem with the
[1:53:21] Rich Young Ruler is that he had done all
[1:53:24] the works his whole life
[1:53:27] this guy was a good guy
[1:53:30] when Jesus said when he came to Jesus he
[1:53:33] said what do I do to attain eternal life
[1:53:36] Jesus said well keep the Commandments
[1:53:39] and then Jesus named up the Commandments
[1:53:42] and the Rich Young Ruler said all these
[1:53:44] have I kept from my youth
[1:53:49] this guy was not just
[1:53:51] this guy wasn't sneaky and and that's
[1:53:54] why he was financially well off
[1:53:57] this guy had kept all the Commandments
[1:53:59] this guy was at every church service he
[1:54:02] helped with every event he was there he
[1:54:06] was on top of it and he was successful
[1:54:12] in fact he paid his tithings from that
[1:54:15] success he great gave great offerings
[1:54:18] we know that because he was well liked
[1:54:23] he was known in the church there
[1:54:30] but Jesus picked out the one thing about
[1:54:33] it that was the problem
[1:54:37] is that he saw it as I did it all myself
[1:54:42] and I'm not asking
[1:54:45] for eternal life
[1:54:48] but I'm asking what can I do for eternal
[1:54:50] life
[1:54:51] because it if I do it I deserve eternal
[1:54:55] life
[1:54:57] he was looking for another work
[1:54:59] and anytime you work for something it
[1:55:02] means that you're getting paid
[1:55:08] so Jesus didn't hit him
[1:55:10] at his riches because he of it was money
[1:55:15] but it was because however he viewed it
[1:55:19] and Jesus realized if he had to give up
[1:55:21] everything that he felt he had earned
[1:55:24] just like he was trying to earn
[1:55:27] eternal life
[1:55:28] if he could turn his back on all of that
[1:55:30] then there was a hope and a chance for
[1:55:33] him to actually see
[1:55:35] that eternal life is not something you
[1:55:37] work for but a gift
[1:55:41] it's not something you can earn it's
[1:55:43] something given
[1:55:45] not because you deserve it but because
[1:55:48] of the grace of God
[1:55:54] and we get caught up in the same way
[1:55:59] we get caught up in the same way we
[1:56:01] think if we can hustle hard enough
[1:56:04] we deserve to win if we hustle hard
[1:56:07] enough
[1:56:08] we deserve God's blessings if we hustle
[1:56:11] hard enough
[1:56:13] if we if we prove ourselves if we work
[1:56:17] the hardest within the church if we work
[1:56:19] the hardest within the body if we
[1:56:22] testify to the most people if we sing
[1:56:25] the most songs if we play the most
[1:56:26] beautiful music if we convert the most
[1:56:29] people
[1:56:31] then we deserve
[1:56:34] eternal life
[1:56:38] and you're trying to do this by
[1:56:40] something that you can attain by what
[1:56:42] you've worked
[1:56:44] but you've never developed a
[1:56:46] relationship with the father
[1:57:00] here we are we're already 9 20.
[1:57:08] in the message the power of decision
[1:57:11] 1955.
[1:57:14] got
[1:57:17] two quotes here
[1:57:25] we develop routines we develop
[1:57:29] conditioning we develop
[1:57:33] things that we just become to see as
[1:57:36] familiar now the word familiar in my
[1:57:39] title
[1:57:40] what that means is is
[1:57:44] you become so accustomed to someone or
[1:57:47] something
[1:57:48] that you actually lose the respect
[1:57:53] to a certain extent
[1:57:55] for that person or their position or or
[1:57:58] or the location
[1:58:00] and I think many times in our
[1:58:02] relationships both with each other
[1:58:06] and with the Lord we become
[1:58:09] too familiar
[1:58:13] and we get so familiar that it doesn't
[1:58:16] mean anything anymore
[1:58:18] when something's familiar it loses its
[1:58:20] specialness
[1:58:23] and when it loses its specialness
[1:58:27] then it loses its importance to us
[1:58:31] and it's okay to have
[1:58:34] a certain amount of familiarity that
[1:58:35] allows you to interact with someone and
[1:58:38] not always be uncomfortable or uneasy
[1:58:43] but just like
[1:58:45] certain areas that say
[1:58:48] the like with the president of the
[1:58:50] United States of America
[1:58:52] it doesn't matter how familiar someone
[1:58:54] becomes with that man as long as he is
[1:58:57] the president of the United States of
[1:58:59] America you will always address him
[1:59:02] first as Mr President
[1:59:06] it's not just Bob or John or or whatever
[1:59:09] that Man's first name is but because of
[1:59:12] the office
[1:59:14] it commands a certain amount of respect
[1:59:16] that doesn't allow you to become overly
[1:59:19] familiar
[1:59:21] and
[1:59:22] we forget that
[1:59:25] God wants to know us to know him as a
[1:59:27] father and be willing to come to him in
[1:59:29] that way
[1:59:31] but he doesn't ever want it to come to a
[1:59:33] point that we lose that reverence in his
[1:59:36] presence
[1:59:37] where it's just something ah I'm just
[1:59:40] going to church again
[1:59:42] I'm just reading my Bible again
[1:59:45] but there should be a certain amount of
[1:59:47] reverence every single time
[1:59:51] and that's
[1:59:52] sometimes through our routines what we
[1:59:55] lose
[1:59:58] is we lose that reverence because we
[2:00:00] come become overly familiar
[2:00:06] that it just becomes just another book
[2:00:09] to us
[2:00:12] we say no it's it's it we believe
[2:00:14] something about it but how do you treat
[2:00:17] it where do you leave it
[2:00:19] how do you take care of it where do you
[2:00:21] place it
[2:00:24] when we come into this building when we
[2:00:26] come into the church
[2:00:28] you know there's nothing special about
[2:00:29] the building
[2:00:32] it's just a building
[2:00:34] made out of brick and mortar and
[2:00:36] made out of wood and drywall insulation
[2:00:40] metal
[2:00:42] same as any other building
[2:00:45] but it's about what the building
[2:00:47] represents
[2:00:50] about the reverence
[2:00:52] but many of us especially if we grew up
[2:00:54] in church
[2:00:55] we become very familiar
[2:00:59] and we lose that reverence
[2:01:01] for the fact that not that we're
[2:01:03] entering a church building
[2:01:06] but the reason why we come then to the
[2:01:08] church building
[2:01:11] we come into the church building to meet
[2:01:13] with God
[2:01:18] not that you can't meet God anywhere
[2:01:20] else but this location this space
[2:01:25] this room
[2:01:27] it's reason for being
[2:01:31] is for the people of God to meet with
[2:01:34] God
[2:01:36] and so when you come under that
[2:01:38] expectation
[2:01:40] it'll put you us under under a certain
[2:01:43] amount of reverence
[2:01:44] not for the building
[2:01:46] but for he whom you come to meet in the
[2:01:50] building
[2:01:52] you see because
[2:01:54] you could walk into a room and if it was
[2:01:56] empty
[2:01:57] it'd just be any room
[2:02:02] but if the head of if you're the head of
[2:02:05] the CEO of your company was sitting in
[2:02:07] the room you would act different in that
[2:02:09] room
[2:02:10] than you would if no one else was there
[2:02:15] you'd be you'd probably be very nervous
[2:02:16] you walk into the room and you weren't
[2:02:18] expecting them there and there he is and
[2:02:20] and uh you're gonna be walking around
[2:02:23] pacing or if you get to sit down and and
[2:02:26] at a desk or something and hide your
[2:02:27] hands you're you're like
[2:02:30] you know
[2:02:31] you don't know where to leave your hands
[2:02:33] you don't know where to look up look to
[2:02:35] the side look down you're why because
[2:02:37] there's there's something about the
[2:02:39] position of the men
[2:02:41] that develops a certain amount of
[2:02:43] respect
[2:02:45] and you want to know okay why is it why
[2:02:48] am I in this room with this individual
[2:02:52] as a single employee of this company
[2:02:54] you're not you're not the person right
[2:02:57] below him
[2:02:58] the where he has a reason to be talking
[2:03:00] to you
[2:03:03] even your direct manager if you get
[2:03:05] called in you don't know why
[2:03:07] you're first thinking well what did I do
[2:03:09] wrong
[2:03:10] what's going on
[2:03:11] what should I be preparing myself for
[2:03:13] what should I know
[2:03:16] you don't just unless you're someone who
[2:03:18] just doesn't care about your job you
[2:03:19] don't just wander in there and like
[2:03:21] throw yourself down in the chair and
[2:03:23] kick your feet up on their desk
[2:03:26] no because there's a certain amount of
[2:03:28] respect
[2:03:29] there's a certain amount of reverence
[2:03:31] not for the room not for the chair not
[2:03:35] for the desk
[2:03:36] but for the person in the room
[2:03:38] and what they represent
[2:03:43] and so it is when we come to church
[2:03:46] is it's not that we're putting any
[2:03:48] amount of reverence on the building or
[2:03:51] on the chairs or on the instrument or
[2:03:53] even on the minister or on the other
[2:03:56] people coming
[2:03:59] but if you're coming for the right
[2:04:00] reason a relationship with Jesus Christ
[2:04:03] where he said wherever two or three are
[2:04:05] gathered together in my name
[2:04:07] there I'll be also and you know that
[2:04:09] many times many times
[2:04:12] more than two or three have gathered in
[2:04:14] his name in this room
[2:04:16] in this building
[2:04:18] you'll come through those doors with a
[2:04:19] different attitude
[2:04:21] you'll come through and you'll say
[2:04:23] you're waiting you'll come and take your
[2:04:25] seat and you'll begin to just pray and
[2:04:28] read and enter into the worship and just
[2:04:31] say Lord I know you're here
[2:04:34] father let me approach you correctly
[2:04:38] in a way where you would be willing to
[2:04:40] come and speak directly to me
[2:04:42] and meet my need
[2:04:44] father I don't come asking
[2:04:47] or demanding anything from you
[2:04:50] but only that which you've already
[2:04:52] promised
[2:04:53] and I'm coming according to your word
[2:04:58] that you said you could not break
[2:05:02] you see it's all about the approach
[2:05:05] you're approaching him the right way
[2:05:07] you're not just walking in and sitting
[2:05:09] down all right Lord bless me I'm here
[2:05:11] can't you see the work I did I made it
[2:05:13] to church
[2:05:15] I had to work real hard I really wanted
[2:05:17] to sleep in
[2:05:20] it's a Sunday morning I didn't really I
[2:05:23] was tired I stayed up playing
[2:05:25] all night on Saturday didn't really feel
[2:05:27] like being here
[2:05:29] I had to really put in some effort to
[2:05:30] make it
[2:05:32] I deserve to be blessed now
[2:05:35] and yet that's how many of us come
[2:05:38] through the doors
[2:05:40] is we feel like in some way the effort
[2:05:43] of us making it to church
[2:05:46] makes us worthy of a certain amount of
[2:05:49] blessing
[2:05:52] but what he wants to see
[2:05:55] his children
[2:05:57] coming through those doors
[2:06:01] pouring out their praises unto him
[2:06:05] and letting those Praises come up before
[2:06:07] the altar
[2:06:09] and hymns being so pleased he says I
[2:06:12] can't I can't stay up here any longer
[2:06:15] I can hear my people
[2:06:18] worshiping
[2:06:20] I can hear them praising
[2:06:22] and I can't stay here away from them
[2:06:26] they're not asking me for anything
[2:06:28] all they've done is thank me all morning
[2:06:33] and I am so happy
[2:06:36] I'm gonna go down there and just walk
[2:06:39] amongst them
[2:06:42] that only that's all he has to do for
[2:06:44] all our issues and problems to be solved
[2:06:47] you know
[2:06:49] is One Moment In His presence
[2:06:51] he doesn't even have to say anything
[2:06:54] just let his presence come by and all
[2:06:56] those problems and issues wafed away
[2:07:01] but he'll do that and much more
[2:07:05] if you approach the throne correctly
[2:07:08] if you come realizing you're a son and
[2:07:10] everything that you've
[2:07:13] seen all these promises have been yours
[2:07:16] the whole time and the father's just
[2:07:18] been waiting
[2:07:19] just waiting for the sun to get into the
[2:07:22] right condition
[2:07:23] to come and ask the right way
[2:07:27] that's all the father was waiting for in
[2:07:29] the story we read
[2:07:31] the father wasn't withholding from the
[2:07:34] son
[2:07:35] the son didn't come and ask and father
[2:07:37] would it be okay if I had a little
[2:07:39] party with my friends and the father
[2:07:41] saying I don't know maybe we work
[2:07:43] another five years I'll think about it
[2:07:46] the sun just never came and asked
[2:07:51] he he was trying to work hard enough to
[2:07:53] be worthy of a party someday
[2:07:58] because he felt it belonged all to the
[2:08:00] father
[2:08:01] and the father said well it's all the
[2:08:02] sons so he can do with it as he wishes
[2:08:04] when he wishes so he must not wish
[2:08:07] and yet that's where we all stand
[2:08:09] tonight
[2:08:13] come before the father
[2:08:15] say Lord
[2:08:16] I'm just coming upon your promises I'm
[2:08:18] coming upon your word
[2:08:20] I'm not trying to work it up I'm not
[2:08:23] trying to prove anything
[2:08:25] I'm just coming because I read in your
[2:08:28] word that you promised
[2:08:31] you'd be with me you promised you'd care
[2:08:34] for me you'd promise you'd you'd watch
[2:08:37] over me you promised me good health you
[2:08:40] promised me all these things I don't I
[2:08:42] don't need to deserve them you've
[2:08:44] promised them and you said I've already
[2:08:47] paid the price for all of them
[2:08:52] but we're so busy trying to work it up
[2:08:55] we've never even read the promises we've
[2:08:58] never gone back to the will to see what
[2:09:00] the father put in there for us
[2:09:04] we're trying to work ourselves to win an
[2:09:07] inheritance that always already belongs
[2:09:09] to us
[2:09:14] we have to break our routines
[2:09:17] break out of our shell
[2:09:19] and go beyond it
[2:09:22] the power of decision
[2:09:24] you know what's the matter with the
[2:09:26] church today
[2:09:27] don't get in the spirit enough we're too
[2:09:30] much in ourselves
[2:09:31] my if you'll just get out of yourself
[2:09:33] long enough you say well you know our
[2:09:36] churches we have a regular routine who
[2:09:39] cares about your routine
[2:09:42] I wish you'd get out of the routine long
[2:09:45] enough to get saved anyhow amen get
[2:09:48] saved get out of the routine we don't
[2:09:51] care about the routine get in the spirit
[2:09:53] then you can see things done
[2:09:56] an old Prophet one time got all stirred
[2:09:58] up because somebody come to him it
[2:10:00] wasn't right for him to come he kind of
[2:10:02] got his righteous indignation up and you
[2:10:04] know what he did before the Spirit come
[2:10:06] on him he had to go sing some good
[2:10:09] spiritual songs then he got in the
[2:10:11] spirit and began to see things he saw
[2:10:13] some visions
[2:10:14] I tell you brother life will look a lot
[2:10:16] different when the church gets in the
[2:10:18] spirit that's right and gets out of
[2:10:21] itself and the routine that you're in
[2:10:23] amen lay aside those weights those
[2:10:27] weights
[2:10:29] you gotta find out the ladies Aid
[2:10:31] Society got their dinner next week and
[2:10:34] what you got to do lay aside those
[2:10:36] things lay aside those works
[2:10:39] give time to old-fashioned heartfelt
[2:10:42] pouring out of the to the Lord Jesus
[2:10:45] Christ until the Holy Ghost pours down
[2:10:47] upon your soul you'll get beside
[2:10:50] yourself
[2:10:51] maybe you can get with Jesus if you get
[2:10:54] away from yourself once amen musicians
[2:10:57] if you want to come you can't be with
[2:10:59] yourself and Jesus
[2:11:02] Now isn't that something
[2:11:05] you can't be with yourself and Jesus
[2:11:10] because as long as you're focusing on
[2:11:12] yourself there ain't nothing he can do
[2:11:14] for you
[2:11:15] you find out you're the biggest enemy
[2:11:18] you got if I can get William random out
[2:11:20] of the way Jesus can have a wonderful
[2:11:23] time but you got to get him out of the
[2:11:25] way so then you start see they started
[2:11:29] on the light-footed feeling wonderful
[2:11:32] why they were following the pillar of
[2:11:34] fire god going before them
[2:11:43] they were following the pillar of fire
[2:11:45] god going before them when he cut away
[2:11:48] through the Red Seas
[2:11:49] and she walled up then they got on the
[2:11:52] other side and got back to Earth again
[2:11:53] their feet on the ground they looked
[2:11:56] around after the spirit went off of them
[2:11:57] they seen what had happened they got
[2:12:00] excited they got so excited until Moses
[2:12:02] raised up his hands and began to sing in
[2:12:04] the spirit and Miriam his sister the
[2:12:06] prophetess
[2:12:07] that was the celebrity of the crowd amen
[2:12:10] she got so excited she grabbed the
[2:12:12] tambourine and began to beat the
[2:12:15] tambourine and dance and the daughters
[2:12:17] of Israel followed her up and down the
[2:12:19] banks
[2:12:20] beating the tambourine and dancing
[2:12:22] Hallelujah
[2:12:23] if that ain't an old-fashioned
[2:12:26] Pentecostal camp meeting I never seen
[2:12:29] one in my life brother
[2:12:30] if this is the latter rain that must
[2:12:33] have been the former Reign hallelujah
[2:12:35] what is it the same Holy Ghost the
[2:12:38] pillar of fire the same Redeemer walking
[2:12:41] in the light moving on what a Time
[2:12:46] Saints
[2:12:51] [Music]
[2:12:53] if we can just break out of our routine
[2:12:56] of serving God
[2:13:01] and re-establish our relationship with
[2:13:03] him
[2:13:05] Everything Will Change
[2:13:07] Everything Will Change not just the
[2:13:10] relationship you have with him
[2:13:13] but the relationship the relationships
[2:13:15] where you feel you're struggling with
[2:13:16] others
[2:13:18] those problems will just melt away
[2:13:22] I didn't say you won't have no problems
[2:13:27] but it'll be different
[2:13:31] because the comforter will be dwelling
[2:13:34] inside
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:36] when that relationship with Jesus Christ
[2:13:38] when you begin to gain that back
[2:13:42] and you realize that I'm not just
[2:13:45] reading this Bible because
[2:13:47] I have to it's a it's a requirement of a
[2:13:51] Christian
[2:13:52] it's a requirement and I want to prove
[2:13:54] to people that I want a greater
[2:13:56] Revelation I I want more of God so I'm
[2:13:59] going to prove that
[2:14:00] by doing this but it becomes something
[2:14:04] that you can't wait for
[2:14:07] even if it's that first few verses even
[2:14:10] if it's that one verse it's just that
[2:14:11] moment that you're listening to a
[2:14:14] message and brother random maybe says
[2:14:16] one word that touches your life
[2:14:19] and you just let that message keep
[2:14:21] playing but all of a sudden something
[2:14:22] comes wasting over you
[2:14:25] the message goes on brother bradham's
[2:14:27] voice drones on
[2:14:30] and God begins to speak to your heart
[2:14:32] it's no longer about
[2:14:34] the message you're listening to
[2:14:37] it's no longer about trying to do enough
[2:14:40] but all of a sudden
[2:14:42] [Music]
[2:14:53] God wolf stepped down on the scene
[2:14:58] like he did for job
[2:15:01] and he'll call you up higher
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:06] you won't be worried about how much you
[2:15:09] memorized
[2:15:11] or how much you can prove
[2:15:15] or how spiritual you look
[2:15:17] because in that moment it'll all be
[2:15:20] Jesus
[2:15:21] in that moment whether you're in your
[2:15:23] car you're at work wherever you're at
[2:15:28] wherever you're at because it's a
[2:15:30] relationship and not a word you see the
[2:15:32] difference between relationship and work
[2:15:34] is that when it's a work
[2:15:37] if you feel you're being forced to do it
[2:15:39] outside of the routine time for that to
[2:15:42] happen
[2:15:43] you're going to be uncomfortable
[2:15:46] you're going to feel uneasy and you're
[2:15:49] going to be upset about it
[2:15:52] because that's what happens anytime
[2:15:54] something that is a work
[2:15:59] foreign gets forced into your life
[2:16:02] during a time that when you feel you
[2:16:04] don't have time to do it
[2:16:07] I'm already busy I give enough time to
[2:16:10] that as it is
[2:16:11] I don't have more time to give
[2:16:19] it happens to all of us
[2:16:23] someone will ask you to do something
[2:16:24] that hey hey can you do this one thing
[2:16:26] for me and you'd be like
[2:16:28] I'll do that a little bit later I ain't
[2:16:30] got time for that right now
[2:16:32] can't you see I'm busy
[2:16:34] [Music]
[2:16:35] but if you have a relationship of love
[2:16:39] and be like yeah no problem I can do
[2:16:41] that
[2:16:42] [Music]
[2:16:43] I'll take care of that for you
[2:16:47] and that's a natural type
[2:16:49] but the same thing with our spiritual
[2:16:51] life when you have a relationship with
[2:16:53] Jesus Christ
[2:16:55] it doesn't matter what you're doing
[2:16:56] you'll be studying for the biggest test
[2:16:58] you've ever taken in your life
[2:17:00] foreign
[2:17:01] you could be under so much pressure from
[2:17:03] work
[2:17:04] and there's a problem you got to figure
[2:17:06] out and your job is on the line
[2:17:09] and all of a sudden you'll feel that
[2:17:10] presence come by
[2:17:13] and the level of importance of that test
[2:17:17] the level of importance of that problem
[2:17:19] will just melt right away
[2:17:21] you'll say Lord
[2:17:24] I am so thankful you're here right now
[2:17:29] what is it that you wanted to share with
[2:17:31] me I am so humbled
[2:17:34] to be in your presence
[2:17:36] [Music]
[2:17:39] because you know that he cares so much
[2:17:41] about you
[2:17:44] that he won't let you fail
[2:17:45] [Music]
[2:17:48] that test you were studying for
[2:17:51] he'll see you through it that job you're
[2:17:54] in if you're meant to keep it you'll be
[2:17:57] fine
[2:17:58] but he's wanting to see Abraham
[2:18:02] Abraham
[2:18:03] take your only son
[2:18:07] sacrifice him back to me
[2:18:10] God wasn't looking for Abraham's works
[2:18:14] he was looking for his relationship
[2:18:18] it wasn't about what Abraham did but why
[2:18:22] he did it
[2:18:23] he said Lord I love you so much
[2:18:28] even if you want this thing I prize the
[2:18:31] most
[2:18:33] not only will I give it to you
[2:18:36] but I'll go on a three-day journey to do
[2:18:39] it
[2:18:41] I'll take more of myself
[2:18:43] and put that into
[2:18:44] [Music]
[2:18:48] because God was trying to get Abraham's
[2:18:51] attention and say Abraham
[2:18:54] Abraham
[2:18:55] do you even understand
[2:18:58] the relationship we have and my depth of
[2:19:02] love for you
[2:19:04] because in all these situations of job
[2:19:07] of the this young man here with his
[2:19:09] father of Abraham with Isaac
[2:19:13] it was all the father's purpose
[2:19:17] to get the son to recognize the love of
[2:19:21] the father
[2:19:21] [Music]
[2:19:23] see the father in all these situations
[2:19:26] the father already knew how much he
[2:19:27] loved the son
[2:19:29] but he wanted the son to realize how
[2:19:32] much
[2:19:33] [Music]
[2:19:35] he loved him back
[2:19:38] that he would come to a realization this
[2:19:40] isn't just something I do for works
[2:19:43] but I love you so much there isn't
[2:19:45] anything I wouldn't do
[2:19:49] let's just pray
[2:19:52] Heavenly Father Lord we just come before
[2:19:54] you once again this evening father Lord
[2:19:56] and
[2:19:57] Lord I hope that just this simple
[2:19:59] thought was a benefit to somebody father
[2:20:01] Lord that
[2:20:03] they can see the lord it's not about how
[2:20:06] many Works they can do or how they can
[2:20:09] prove their love father
[2:20:12] how busy they can be but it's about a
[2:20:15] relationship with Jesus Christ
[2:20:18] it's about getting one-on-one with the
[2:20:21] father and realizing
[2:20:23] all the things that we've been trying to
[2:20:26] garnish favor for
[2:20:29] they've been ours all along this time
[2:20:33] if we would just realize the Father's
[2:20:35] Love For Us
[2:20:37] if we just realize his promises and his
[2:20:39] will
[2:20:41] that we can start laying start laying
[2:20:43] claim to them one at a time
[2:20:46] and the father would just be so pleased
[2:20:49] foreign
[2:20:50] pour them out upon us
[2:20:53] with all we ask that you just come and
[2:20:55] have your way go with your people father
[2:20:57] bless them for Lord coming and
[2:21:02] Lord putting in their time and effort
[2:21:05] despite the weather father
[2:21:08] despite what the outside would look like
[2:21:10] Father those who are unable to be here
[2:21:13] whether they're at work or whether they
[2:21:16] had other obligations father the family
[2:21:18] or sickness whatever it might be or to
[2:21:22] ask you just go to each of them wherever
[2:21:24] they are
[2:21:25] Lord your presence would go with them
[2:21:27] now and throughout the week Lord may
[2:21:29] they just go rejoicing father realizing
[2:21:32] that they don't need to hurry the
[2:21:35] father's favor they've had it all along
[2:21:38] oh we're just so thankful for your
[2:21:41] goodness and your mercy in our lives we

[2:26:24] come right behind
[2:26:26] brother Jordan tonight and says that
[2:26:29] that was wonderful tonight amen we thank
[2:26:31] the Lord you know uh just sitting there
[2:26:35] and and you know being preached or and
[2:26:39] just seeing how the Lord was bringing
[2:26:42] for the word you know every serve is
[2:26:44] just so special amen every self is so
[2:26:47] special you know last last Wednesday
[2:26:50] brother Dan was preaching on three
[2:26:52] minutes to midnight
[2:26:54] and it was almost about uh uh
[2:27:00] it was almost about 8 53 55.
[2:27:05] before he started getting into his
[2:27:07] message so I'm thinking in my mind is he
[2:27:09] trying to preach on it for three minutes
[2:27:12] I'm watching what this brother is doing
[2:27:14] is he actually going to preach for three
[2:27:16] minutes he kept going from one thing to
[2:27:18] another I've not got to my message yet
[2:27:20] I'm looking at the time it's almost
[2:27:22] three minutes I said I see I will see
[2:27:24] how he will pull this one out tonight
[2:27:26] praise the Lord but we thank the Lord
[2:27:29] and uh but let me say this let me say
[2:27:32] this before we pray because I just think
[2:27:35] that after listening to the message
[2:27:37] tonight
[2:27:39] I mean it just called for
[2:27:44] I was going into our our individual
[2:27:48] closet
[2:27:51] the Holy Spirit that's that's what the
[2:27:53] message is you know it just for us to go
[2:27:57] into our individual
[2:28:02] let's turn around the message which of
[2:28:05] course that's what God is doing we are
[2:28:07] the bride
[2:28:09] and the thing about
[2:28:12] that is the other it's all about a
[2:28:15] relationship
[2:28:16] it's not about church membership
[2:28:19] that's what the message is all about
[2:28:23] this message is all about relationship
[2:28:28] this message is
[2:28:31] is supposed to affect every form of our
[2:28:35] relationship because the marriage
[2:28:38] relationship is the highest form of
[2:28:40] relationship
[2:28:41] is the highest form of relationship
[2:28:45] in life
[2:28:47] praise the Lord
[2:28:51] that's the reason why the talking is the
[2:28:53] highlight
[2:28:55] of the message like brother Branham said
[2:29:00] If the message is not affecting your
[2:29:05] relationship
[2:29:09] then that's where your problem is
[2:29:13] praise the Lord It's All About
[2:29:15] relationship
[2:29:17] it's all about relationship
[2:29:20] and you know when you when you break
[2:29:22] into that cycle of relationship
[2:29:25] church is not a burden
[2:29:28] you enjoy it
[2:29:30] it's almost like you enjoy to go home
[2:29:35] you must enjoy to go home
[2:29:38] you must not start to go oh my goodness
[2:29:41] man
[2:29:44] my wife
[2:29:48] and you know you would really have a
[2:29:49] problem
[2:29:51] you just enjoy being out and spending
[2:29:55] time home then you have a serious
[2:29:57] problem
[2:30:02] praise the Lord
[2:30:03] oh I'm telling you we're going to cook
[2:30:06] this one amen
[2:30:08] we're going to cook this one
[2:30:11] we take the message to be about a
[2:30:15] privilege we are in a message so we have
[2:30:17] this privilege we are the bride
[2:30:21] like an entitlement
[2:30:24] there are people they don't do nothing
[2:30:26] they are the foolish virgin their
[2:30:28] denomination
[2:30:30] and here we don't have no relationship
[2:30:35] with the father
[2:30:38] the older son he was just as practical
[2:30:43] as the one that was going away
[2:30:45] because the word prodigal means wistful
[2:30:49] when you are Wishful you are a prodigal
[2:30:54] when you don't know how to manage your
[2:30:56] time because
[2:30:59] he gave us 24 hours
[2:31:01] [Music]
[2:31:09] so I was seeing the prodigal at home and
[2:31:12] a brother got away
[2:31:19] that is the beauty of this message
[2:31:21] brother Branham says this message had
[2:31:24] taught us how to marry our wives
[2:31:27] how to raise our children
[2:31:32] foreign
[2:31:33] that's the beauty of the message
[2:31:36] it's relationship
[2:31:40] it must be able to affect our
[2:31:42] relationship in every way
[2:31:45] every way
[2:31:50] [Music]
[2:32:01] foreign
[2:32:10] we all can take their home
[2:32:14] and see how much
[2:32:17] are we in the chamber
[2:32:20] how much are we allowing the Holy Spirit
[2:32:22] to have his will
[2:32:29] we try to trying to make it by our
[2:32:32] hustle we are trying to make it we are
[2:32:35] trying to do it
[2:32:37] if you just think about it it's just
[2:32:40] always baffled my mind and that thought
[2:32:42] has blessed me all the time you know
[2:32:46] before everything that Joseph went
[2:32:48] through
[2:32:52] he became a prime minister
[2:32:54] begin the next to pharaoh
[2:32:56] Daniel there in captivity
[2:33:02] he was brought to the place of greatness
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:07] and it was all because
[2:33:11] they fall in the relationship
[2:33:17] Daniel purpose in his heart
[2:33:20] that he will not Define himself
[2:33:26] saying sometimes it's the simple things
[2:33:29] as much as just just those things that
[2:33:33] just move the heart of the father
[2:33:35] [Music]
[2:33:45] foreign
[2:33:47] [Music]
[2:34:17] have won the lover
[2:34:21] let thy

[2:38:27] serve God
[2:38:32] on the basis of love
[2:38:37] save the father
[2:38:39] live your life of appreciation
[2:38:42] not a life to please him
[2:38:48] a life of appreciation of all that he
[2:38:51] have done
[2:38:52] [Music]
[2:38:55] foreign
[2:38:58] [Music]
[2:39:17] problem there is that we don't trust him
[2:39:21] and when the element of trust is
[2:39:23] destroyed in relationship
[2:39:25] foreign
[2:39:27] for the downward slope
[2:39:36] you trust the Lord enough tonight

[2:40:55] even our our devotion with the Lord is
[2:40:59] in such a hurry
[2:41:01] foreign
[2:41:14] we can't even get on our bed like David
[2:41:16] said he David said I pulled my pillows
[2:41:19] to me
[2:41:21] and I saw
[2:41:23] taking on your goodness
[2:41:26] I wet my pillow with tears

[2:42:13] relationship with him
[2:42:16] you have a relationship you are excited
[2:42:19] to see the person you can't wait that's
[2:42:22] why brother Branham said we can't wait
[2:42:23] for those doors to be open
[2:42:28] when a relationship goes sour
[2:42:31] that's when we linger that's when we
[2:42:32] dread that's when it's become a burden
[2:42:40] Heavenly Father
[2:42:43] your word being preached tonight Lord
