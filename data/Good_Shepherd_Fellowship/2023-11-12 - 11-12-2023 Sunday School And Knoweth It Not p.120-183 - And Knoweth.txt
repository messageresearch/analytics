TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] his very whole purpose was the church now how do we get into this church by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body the church the body of Christ it cannot fail now here's what happens now watch this just a little figurative picture here now this outside man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see and it has five inlets to that body and any grammar school child as myself would know these five senses control the body seed taste feel smell and here without that you can't touch the body that's the only way you have to the body seed taste feel smell here you see it taste it feel it now that is the evil one on the outside now inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the Breath of Life is breathed into it that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God but it was given permitted by God now you got that for every child that's born in the world is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies is that right so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with now but now it's got five inlets and that five inlets I don't know where call them right off now whe first I know is thought conscience and love choice no conscience love reason there's five inlets to the spirit you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit you have to the reason you can't reason with your physical being because reason doesn't see taste feel smell ear reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body's laying there dead but your spirit can still reason these five senses that controls that Inside Man and that thou to the last man which is the soul there's only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agencies free will to choose or to reject and now the re reason that people today now don't forget this now you you'll see what the holy what the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is see now people can live in this spirit and they dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that Spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit because watch that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman she was wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't tell her Bob and her hair was wrong well what's your hair Got to Do With It Well it did to Samson whosoever shall add one word to this or take one word from it you've got to have an ultimate somewhere now for instance if I was a a a Baptist man and you come down and told me I must be I must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it's in the Bible well the first thing you know I ask my pastor and I go to the pastor he say oh that's something back there see yeah see uh we Baptist here's what we believe we believe that we should be immersed in the titles of father son Holy Ghost that's way all the church has done it since John Smith founded it that's where it's done well that's your timate heck with what that guy says what if you're a Methodist and sprinkling is your system and you are told you must be immersed see what I mean you go back to the Methodist Pastor he'll right and ask the bishop so and so said so and so about this but we the Methodist Church who was founded 3 or 400 years ago in England by John Wesley and Whitfield and all the rest of them there in Asbury we founded this document following John Wesley that we are to be sprinkled because it's just an outward em farm and we think it's sprinkling is just as good as it is the other way if you're a real if the Methodist Church is your timation that's as far as you go if you're a Catholic and I tell you it's not in the Bible not to eat meat on uh Fridays and all these things I guess the Holy Eucharist isn't a way wafer because it's a spirit and so forth and you go to your priest the priest say here it is wrote right in our document and if the church is your ultimate you don't give a hoot what anybody says that's your ultimate oh God help this to sink in to me the whole thing's wrong God word is the ultimate whatever that word says then that's right now the only way up here in these SP spheres that you could ever be in this little Inside Man that you have to be for are deed because you was with God you're a part of God I was in my father I also was in my grandfather my grandfather's grandfather by seed I was in that and I was in Christ you were in Christ before the foundation of the world he came to redeem his own his own that was in him amen hallelujah his children that was in him you never came to to say the devil's children they never will know it am and they are so shrewd in the ways of their intellectual learning that you can't compare with them at all you can out talk them but by faith you sit now science don't need any faith science proves what they're talking about it doesn't need any faith the Catholic preach will tell you look how long the Catholic church is waved look how long she stood under the persecutions of paganism the Methodist Church said look here how long I've seen a church talk about a hypocrite sign coming up the road yesterday I seen said the Church of Christ established ad33 and ain't 100 years old yet the denomination oh my doctrine of the Apostles hardly got anything they're the Sadducees of the day no Spirit no and you can't tell them you can't talk to them you can't reason with them because we go beyond reasoning lean not to your own understanding amen Faith doesn't reason at all Faith believes it they say now look here you believe we have to do these things back there nonsense that but the Bible said so I can't explain how it happens but it happens God said so so you don't have I can't tell you nothing about it Faith doesn't explain it did you know that Faith just believes it Jesus said to Nicodemus from The ecumenical counsil of his day come to him tonight said Master we know your a teacher comes from God cuz no man could do the things you knew unless God is with him he said verely I S you except the man be born again he can't even see the kingdom but God said me an old man entered into my mother's wounds to be born he said now how I'm going going to tell you Heavenly things when you won't even believe Earthly things then he said one day except you eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood you have no life in you he didn't explain it those are Apostles and them of that day who was ordained to life he noted said all the father has given me will come amen only thing I have to do is just make my voice KN they know it for my sheep know my voice and a voice is a word expressed they believe it anyhow they don't have to scientifically prove anything or ask any sadducee or Pharisee or anything else about it I said it they believe it for my sheep hear my voice and this is the voice of God in letter form because this is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ Old and New Testament put together am amen there you are why you say these are good people what makes them because one thing their TI poost is on a church and in here you remember last Sunday it's a week ago how many was here and hear the sermon on the anointed ones in the last days I think all of you see they are anointed their Spirits are anointed in the second realm now that first woman says no she don't give a hoot what the church says what anybody else says she's a Smart Dock she's got college education she can put it over on her husband and think she's smart by doing that this other woman is naked blind and don't know it oh it's pitiful but that's a picture the Bible paints us yeah as she goes to church that woman would probably be better that woman would be she lives a good clean life there's nothing against that God will be the judge of it I don't know I'm not the judge I'm only the responsible for what he shows me that's what the Apostle said we do speak that what we know what we heard what we seen that's all I'm responsible for that's all you're responsible for but now see if you take that same woman where did she wind up at see she moved right around she heard no doubt turn her radio many times the voice of God has been speaking many times when I see she comes over into this cult here a clan all churches are Clans everything exactly right there are just lodges where people group together as membership and she comes over in here well that fits her just right now if you go to telling her what she has to do she won't listen to you you short to in her Bible she won't listen to it now my dear brother sister just one or two more comments before closing it's quarter till time to lay out 15 minutes now look I want to ask you something why can't that woman see it why can't she as far as being in adultery physically to her husband she's not guilty she has nothing to confess she's clean as she was the day she was born no man has touched her I'm speaking parallel now to the woman to the church she as clean as she was born well that's exactly what the church is as she was born but she was bored in sin shaped in iniquity see what I mean now you tell her that it's wrong for her to cut her hair the Bible said so it's wrong for her to wear them shorts the Bible said so she said nonsense why her ultimate is not down here in a third man the soul that's predestinated and sent from God but her ultimate is on an organization out here that some man is organized outside of this see but if the word of God is down in that Soul it says amen I see it it lines up with it now look here therefore the man that's born of the spirit of God see here's the outside flesh I speak in a mixed audience but I speak as your as your pastor as your brother here's the flesh it's weak it's bound to a little lady walks down the street some young man just in his young age when he's 17 18 20 years old 25 30 walks around in there and this young lady comes twisting every form of body walking with a pair of high Shield shoes on her stuck all out in front and back and dresses that high above her knees or a pair of shorts on do you know the Bible said she'd act like that amen you know the Bible said that's the way she'd act amen how she'd be so filthy did you read this year this month's reader digest that man and women of this day little girls from 20 to 25 years old is in menopause that should go through the change of life in the middle age of life according to science between 20 and 25 it used to be around 30 to 35 in my age and my mother's age a woman never struck menopause so she's 40 or 45 what is it it's through sights and the food the hybrids that's perverted the whole human body to we become a bunch of of of a massive corruption well if the physical being is corrupted isn't the brain cell in that physical being now watch the spirit fallowing it and there'll come a time in the name of the Lord that people will go completely insane the Bible says so they'll scream and holler great hideous things in their imaginary mind the radios and things are television programs are producing it there'll be such things ants raised up on the earth that'll be as high as 14 trees there'll be a a a bird will fly across the Earth with wings four or five miles across and people see them they'll screaming hard and cry for Mercy but it'll be the plagues wait till I preach on those plagues opening up watch what Moses done under the physical being not the spirit when he said Moses God said to Moses go out there to his Prophet pick up a handful of dust throw it up in the air and say thus sayith the Lord fleas will come upon the Earth there was no fleas the first thing you know be able to see something crawl on a bush looked over here something else after while they so deep you couldn't wait through them where did they come from yes God is the creator he can do what he will he's Sovereign he can make a a bird that would reach his wings from one side of the Earth to the other he said let there come flies and cloth upon all the Earth there was a fly in the land first thing you know old blowfly begin to fly around first thing is eight or 10 12 first thing you know you couldn't walk to him God the Creator keeps his word and he stretched forth his Rod at the command of God and said let frogs come up and cover the Earth and their frogs come till they Heap them up piles of steak was everywhere were maybe 40 50 ft high of frogs they were in the cupboard of of pharaoh they were in the turned down the sheet there be a 500 frogs under the sheet under the bed in the grub everywhere you wife was frogs frogs frogs where did they come from God the Creator is Sovereign what he says he'll do amen and he said there be hideous sights upon the Earth locuses with hair like women long hair to haunt them women that cut their hair teeth like line stingers and their tails like scarpins they would torment men months just wait till we get in the open them plagues and seals and them seven Thunders watch what takes place oh brother you better get to Goan while it's time to get to Goan don't pay attention this outside look here little lady twist yourself down the street here's a young fell his eyes catches it he's a member of the church he's a Pentecostal he's whatever he is but the first thing you know there's no hold poost in there she'll say hello he's got curly hair and kind of nicel looking straight shouldered young man maybe try to live right she start walking up to him even a preacher the first thing you know what is it this out here the flesh desire and the spirit down here yet anointed saying don't do it don't do it but what will he do he'll move right around there the hole there it goes th say always trying to make a date with her he's guilty of committing adultery where he touches or not but a genuine Born Again Son of God Amen you can't do it yourself it's totally impossible for a a red-blooded male to walk before a female like that without something taking place but when there is something on the inside that little borned again something here though that man might have shouted spok in tongue jump dance everything else Anointed with the spirit done all the signs and wonders that God said in there by his Spirit Jesus said many will come to me in that day said Lord have not prophesy in your name have not cast out devils in your name have I he said depart from me you that work iniquity what is Iniquity something that you know to do and don't do it depart from you that work iniquity I didn't even know but down on the inside of that man if that little tie posted in there that seed of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world I don't care what takes place it's holding it's there to stay that's why that woman will wear them shorts she's counted a prostitute the same as woman in the ACT see she doesn't know that that Spirit how does she know her ultimate what is an ultimate is the last word the ultimate is the amen it's the end of all Strife your ultimate and if you're a church a Pentecostal church that tells you that long hair stuff is just fanaticism you got spare T back your head and so forth them kind of things the man is possessed of the devil amen where God's word said it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair she'll dishonor her head and she dishonors her husband and her husband is the church and the church is Christ she is a dishonorable religious prostitute naked and don't know it naked don't the Bible said the woman's covering is her hair isn't a hair give to her for a cover somay you the Judgment bar I've tried to pour the medicine and hold it with my hands and you spit it right straight back out between your fingers God will judge them someday that's thus sayeth the Lord hasn't been a bun of foolishness for some crazy old man all worked up it isn't because it's a word of the Lord and a real genu and Christian will cope with that inside man that spirit that was back under the beginning which is the word as he was the fullness of all of you you were in him back under Calvary he forew you would be here he only broadcast what would take place and you were in and you died with him you died to your pride you died to your patience you died to the world when he you died with him in Calvary and you Rose with him when he rose again on a third day and because you accepted it now you're sitting in Heavenly places Hallelujah there you [Music] [Music] are [Music] [Music] [Music]
