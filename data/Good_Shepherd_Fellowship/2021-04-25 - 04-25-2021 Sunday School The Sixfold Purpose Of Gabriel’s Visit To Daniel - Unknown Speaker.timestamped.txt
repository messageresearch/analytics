[0:04] this time i met a little
[0:05] fella outside i was coming off my
[0:07] interviews this afternoon and
[0:09] coming down to the church about an hour
[0:11] and a half ago and
[0:12] a little kind of a young fella outside
[0:15] he said i said
[0:17] hobby said it sure is
[0:21] i knew he's from georgia so he said show
[0:23] his hop down in georgia
[0:25] amen well we're trying to escape a
[0:28] hollow place aren't we
[0:30] that's what we're here for thank you so
[0:33] much friends for all your goodness what
[0:35] would i do without you
[0:37] guess what what would i do without you
[0:39] if i had nobody that loved me nobody
[0:41] that would listen to the message
[0:43] all my message would be no good at all i
[0:45] can't preach it to telephone polls and
[0:47] the trees
[0:48] they wouldn't understand it so it's got
[0:49] to be people like you all and
[0:51] come and listen to it and when you come
[0:54] and sit in a hot place like this and
[0:56] it's
[0:57] my wife said she liked to burn up back
[0:59] there this morning
[1:00] and to see people and sometimes sick
[1:03] people
[1:04] that's sitting in the meetings like that
[1:07] god
[1:08] give you a a beautiful lovely home and
[1:11] glory is my prayer
[1:14] and i just hope and trust that he'll do
[1:16] that
[1:17] now let's see my coat somebody tuck it
[1:20] over here
[1:21] and um i got to do a little
[1:25] reason tonight how many is enjoying the
[1:28] first
[1:29] parts of this off it just wasn't so hot
[1:33] we just
[1:33] keep right on going right on through the
[1:35] week with the
[1:37] the book of the revelation i just love
[1:40] it i just
[1:41] live in it and you pray coming for me
[1:44] this week because
[1:45] next sunday of the lord willing i've got
[1:48] to meet that
[1:49] uh place in those weeks together
[1:54] that's something that i do not know
[1:56] nothing about
[1:57] and so i'm just going to trust the lord
[1:59] that he'll have the answer for me
[2:02] and i i've read several different men
[2:05] who
[2:06] who spoke of it who's wrote of it i've
[2:09] read the
[2:10] footnotes you're on dr schofield a great
[2:13] scholar but certainly couldn't agree
[2:15] with him on his
[2:16] many of his footnotes because i can't
[2:18] see where it's got the
[2:20] it got to make the picture right now if
[2:22] you just put
[2:23] it like a jigsaw puzzle together and the
[2:26] first thing you always say well this
[2:27] goes up here and oh i'm sure this goes
[2:29] up here
[2:30] well you got to look over here at your
[2:32] pattern to see what you're doing
[2:35] and then if you if you don't you'll get
[2:38] your scene all mixed up
[2:39] now a lot of you was pick i had a
[2:41] picture of a great beautiful countryside
[2:43] and a cow picking grass up in the top of
[2:45] a tree now that wouldn't be right
[2:47] wouldn't
[2:47] cause you don't pick grass on top of a
[2:49] tree so that's what it is if you
[2:52] the holy spirit doesn't place that
[2:54] scripture together then you got the
[2:56] whole great
[2:57] picture of redemption that's what we
[3:00] want the truth
[3:02] and until we know the truth we'll just
[3:03] leave it alone and then
[3:05] when god gives us the truth so then i
[3:08] i'll speak of it
[3:09] you know what i guess brother roy
[3:11] slaughter and
[3:13] and some of the old-timers here it
[3:15] started back under a long time ago
[3:17] that was for about
[3:20] i guess the first three or four years of
[3:22] my ministry right here at the tabernacle
[3:24] i wouldn't even preach on the subject of
[3:26] hell
[3:27] because i i couldn't make out whether it
[3:29] was a burning place whether it was a
[3:32] grave
[3:33] and every time the word spoke grave i
[3:36] get the translations that hate these
[3:38] hades is the grave every time i spoke of
[3:40] hell
[3:41] hades the green and i just left it alone
[3:44] so i really found out what i was
[3:46] speaking up then i preached on hell
[3:48] so when i really found out the whole
[3:50] picture and seen where it was at because
[3:53] i feel that a minister is responsible to
[3:56] god what he tells that congregation amen
[3:58] because
[3:59] they're going to hold right on to them
[4:01] and so then
[4:02] what if i've got them holding on the
[4:04] wrong place and then the time comes up
[4:06] where that hope won't stand
[4:09] and then that vision the lord give me
[4:10] some time ago when those and millions
[4:13] when
[4:13] at one speaking to me said uh you'll be
[4:17] judged first for the gospel you preached
[4:19] i said i preached the same thing paul is
[4:21] and the rest of them
[4:23] all those millions of voices screamed
[4:24] out we are resting on
[4:26] that amen that was it
[4:30] right so i want to
[4:33] continue on tonight now so it won't be
[4:35] too long and don't forget now
[4:38] i did this morning i got a little notes
[4:40] here this morning i
[4:41] spoke on uh daniel in captivity
[4:45] gabriel coming to him uh and instructed
[4:49] him
[4:49] of the future that's what we had this
[4:52] morning the instruction
[4:53] of the future now tonight we're talking
[4:57] on the six-fold purpose
[4:59] of gabriel's visit to daniel
[5:03] next sunday the lord willing placing the
[5:06] seventy
[5:06] of weeks where they belong in the time
[5:10] element and where are we standing
[5:15] now if we can only find that and make it
[5:18] sure
[5:20] positive then we'll know just the hour
[5:23] that we're living now we won't know when
[5:24] he's coming no one will know that
[5:28] jesus doesn't know it himself he said he
[5:30] didn't he said
[5:31] just the father only knowed that
[5:34] not even the angels know it none of us
[5:36] know when he's coming
[5:38] but we can tell that the hour that
[5:41] the time that we're living knowing just
[5:43] how close we could be
[5:45] now for a little laugh over because the
[5:48] boys are taking tapes of this
[5:50] machines are running back in the room
[5:52] and the tape scores are sent out
[5:54] everywhere now this morning's lesson as
[5:58] we
[5:59] reviewed back on the fourth and fifth
[6:01] chapter
[6:02] then we stuck the beginning with the
[6:05] ninth chapter
[6:06] of daniel and now tonight we're
[6:09] continue on with the ninth chapter
[6:11] before we approach it
[6:13] let's just bow our heads for a moment
[6:15] and speak to the author of the word
[6:20] our gracious god we are
[6:23] sure that you know the very intent of
[6:26] our heart
[6:28] you know why we're here
[6:31] you know that we never come tonight just
[6:34] because
[6:35] that we thought it would be a nice place
[6:37] to come to
[6:38] take a little relaxation for the
[6:40] afternoon
[6:42] father i do not believe there's one
[6:43] person here for that purpose
[6:46] i believe that we are here tonight
[6:48] because we
[6:49] are deadly sincere honest and wanting to
[6:53] know
[6:54] thus saith the lord
[6:57] we love you lord and we love your word
[7:01] if this place that you have provided for
[7:03] us just a roof over our head and these
[7:05] concrete blocks
[7:07] we are thankful to you for the place
[7:10] amen
[7:11] for we believe that there is a home
[7:13] beyond the sky
[7:15] where we are headed that way and we
[7:18] think of our forefathers
[7:21] that didn't even have this privilege and
[7:23] it makes us die our hearts and shame
[7:26] lord
[7:27] they even complain now father we pray
[7:31] that you
[7:31] open to us tonight the scripture
[7:35] come walk along the side of each one of
[7:37] us as we go down this road tonight
[7:41] speak to us like you did those going to
[7:43] emmaus from jerusalem
[7:46] that when the service is over tonight we
[7:49] might go to our different homes and say
[7:51] did not our hearts burn within it
[7:55] as we heard him speaking through his
[7:57] word
[7:59] bless the reading bless my feeble
[8:02] efforts lord
[8:03] open my mouth to that which is true and
[8:05] closer to that which is wrong
[8:08] and get glory to thy self and glory in
[8:11] our people that they might seize
[8:13] the hour that we're living in the near
[8:16] coming of the lord jesus
[8:18] while we ask it in his name the name of
[8:21] jesus christ
[8:22] amen amen thank you
[8:26] now to laugh back our scriptures for a
[8:28] few moments
[8:31] we find that daniel had been
[8:34] in captivity for 68
[8:38] long years think of it
[8:42] i use your paper and pencil i didn't get
[8:45] it this morning mate
[8:46] pick it up tonight from 8606 to 5
[8:51] 38 take 538 from 606 you got
[8:55] 68 years daniel had been in a cafe
[9:00] no church to go to no sermons to hear
[9:04] nothing but he had some books and
[9:06] scrolls
[9:07] that a prophet before him had prophesied
[9:10] and was with jeremiah now while
[9:14] in studying all the scriptures he seen
[9:17] time was running out that the time of
[9:21] the 70 years
[9:23] and daniel solemnly
[9:26] believed every word that jeremiah the
[9:30] prophets fought
[9:31] and i say to this to my class tonight
[9:34] should we believe our prophets
[9:36] amen yes sir for the word of the lord
[9:40] came to the
[9:42] prophets they have thus saith the lord
[9:48] and a true prophet will never vary from
[9:50] the
[9:51] the other prophet's word they'll never
[9:54] make it say something that it doesn't
[9:56] say it
[9:56] they'll say just exactly what their true
[9:59] prophet said
[10:00] that makes them a prophet then when they
[10:02] get that and then they foretell
[10:04] what is to come knowing this with
[10:07] fear in their heart unless they should
[10:10] say something wrong
[10:11] it should lead somebody astray we never
[10:13] want to do that
[10:15] we want to be absolutely sure
[10:18] that we got the word of the lord before
[10:20] we say thus
[10:21] saith the law it must be an
[10:25] absolute direct message from the throne
[10:28] of god
[10:29] or we should never say it now while in
[10:32] studying the scriptures he's seen
[10:34] that the 70 years was running out so him
[10:37] being that 68 years left two years
[10:40] in the future until god would restore
[10:43] his people back to their homeland
[10:45] while in prayer we find out that there
[10:48] was a
[10:49] mighty angel came from heaven can
[10:51] anybody call his name
[10:53] abraham and he is the angel
[10:57] to the jewish church how many knows that
[11:00] everywhere it's gabriel gabriel is the
[11:02] messenger to the
[11:03] jewish church came to mary came to
[11:06] zechariah
[11:07] always it's gabriel and he's one of the
[11:10] great angels
[11:11] of heaven and did not he bring our
[11:14] brother daniel such a wonderful
[11:18] salutation from god oh daniel
[11:21] greatly beloved wouldn't that make you
[11:24] good to think that god loved you
[11:27] if i wasn't greatly loved i just like to
[11:29] know that i'm kind of loved a little bit
[11:31] up there with you
[11:32] sure just kind of he thinks of me once
[11:35] in a while
[11:35] just make me just want to scream to
[11:38] think that he
[11:38] even cares for me and we have the shirts
[11:42] that he does care for us
[11:44] because while we were yet sinners christ
[11:46] died in our sin brother
[11:48] and now have which we were alien from
[11:50] god now has made us not
[11:52] under god and has given us the earnest
[11:55] of our salvation
[11:56] that is the holy spirit and with the
[11:59] faith in there that lifts us
[12:00] up above the things of the world and we
[12:02] ride over the top of it
[12:05] that's glorious isn't it amen all right
[12:09] while in prayer gabriel come and told
[12:12] him
[12:13] that there was not only two more years
[12:17] before they were going back to the
[12:18] homeland but
[12:19] told him the entire destination
[12:22] of that nation thank god
[12:26] the entire destination every journey of
[12:30] earth
[12:31] gabriel explained it to daniel that he
[12:34] was sent
[12:35] to tell daniel this great thing
[12:39] how that prophet must have fell and he
[12:42] told him that there were
[12:44] 70 weeks determined
[12:48] upon the people unto the consummation
[12:51] that's the end time so it's all over the
[12:54] consummation
[12:55] he said there's 70 weeks
[12:59] some of them allows that to months some
[13:01] today some
[13:02] if it's just actually weeks is only
[13:05] about two and a quarter a year or one
[13:06] and a quarter years of it and
[13:08] they see you that's what we got to find
[13:11] to be truthful
[13:13] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[13:17] for what purpose for what whose people
[13:19] wasn't determined upon
[13:21] daniel's people the jews
[13:25] and what was it determined for upon not
[13:28] only
[13:28] daniel but upon daniel's
[13:32] holy city see
[13:35] daniel's holy city now christ
[13:38] what was daniel's holy city
[13:41] jerusalem and now we're going to take
[13:44] maybe get to it tonight
[13:46] where was jerusalem who founded
[13:50] jerusalem
[13:52] you ever think of that who founded
[13:55] jerusalem
[14:00] when was it found
[14:03] we go get to that john
[14:06] who founded jerusalem boy it's a little
[14:09] bitty thing hid back in a corner
[14:12] but it sure tells it answer who founded
[14:15] jerusalem
[14:16] and when was it found all right and
[14:19] that's
[14:19] daniel's holy city and we do
[14:22] understand that that city which is now
[14:27] been a curse for 2 000 years will
[14:30] be rebuilt and re-established again
[14:34] hallelujah and the temple worship will
[14:37] be set up just like it was in the
[14:38] beginning
[14:39] that's right jerusalem will be
[14:44] now and there will be a sacrifice daily
[14:47] opportunity
[14:48] offered again just like it was in the
[14:50] beginning we're going to get into most
[14:52] of that i guess tonight or a lot of it
[14:54] now i want you to know friends that
[14:56] striking all these things
[14:58] i'm certainly leaving out weeks of
[15:00] teaching
[15:01] but just kind of hitting it so that when
[15:04] the weather cools off for a little later
[15:06] when we get into those seven seals seven
[15:08] vials seven trumpets all these things
[15:11] that i can refer back and say do you
[15:13] remember
[15:14] on the 70 weeks of daniel
[15:17] do you remember the church age when it
[15:20] went up and what taken place
[15:22] i mean 70 weeks of daniel covers from
[15:27] the going up of the church until the
[15:29] coming back of the church
[15:31] that space is what it covers now
[15:35] now not all of 70 weeks of daniel part
[15:38] of it
[15:39] 70 weeks are determined now there was
[15:42] a six-fold purpose
[15:45] in his visit telling him what was going
[15:49] to
[15:49] come to pass now there was a six-fold
[15:53] purpose of his coming now tonight i
[15:56] think we leave off over here in the
[15:58] scriptures of where that we was at this
[16:01] morning
[16:02] were that there was a six-fold purpose
[16:07] here we are now we find out
[16:12] that there was the six-fold purpose one
[16:15] of it now let's get the
[16:16] fourth chapter of fourth verse 24th
[16:19] verse
[16:20] of the ninth chapter of daniel
[16:24] and seventy weeks are determined
[16:28] upon thy people
[16:31] now remember that is all that the
[16:35] journey of the israelites will have in
[16:38] this earth they are determined
[16:40] 70 weeks is just determined that's all
[16:43] israeli to the jews
[16:45] upon thy people and upon
[16:48] by holy city
[16:52] therefore this 70 weeks now don't miss
[16:56] it
[16:57] it will reveal
[17:00] from that time to the end of the jews
[17:03] and
[17:04] also to the end of jerusalem
[17:09] until there will be a new city bill
[17:13] ah oh i hope we get into it real good
[17:17] and deep tonight
[17:19] or to turn it upon my people upon my
[17:21] holy city
[17:22] what to to finish the transgression what
[17:25] did he tell him now
[17:26] he was trying to find how long it's
[17:28] going to be
[17:29] i know we're at the end time like we are
[17:31] now lord
[17:32] how many in this class tonight believes
[17:34] that we're at the end times
[17:36] amen thank you we are
[17:39] at the end now we're trying to find by
[17:42] god
[17:43] just how long that's going to be what
[17:46] day are we living
[17:47] that's why we're going back and picking
[17:49] up these prophets
[17:50] and so forth and trying to find out
[17:53] where we are
[17:54] and that's what daniel did he set his
[17:56] face to god how many read daniel 9 today
[17:59] raise up your hands all right to see his
[18:01] prayer high made his confession of his
[18:03] people his confession of himself
[18:06] he wanted to be sure that he found out
[18:08] when they were to go back because he
[18:10] wanted to get the people ready to go
[18:12] back
[18:13] now what i'm trying to do is find out
[18:15] when we're going up
[18:18] and get the people ready to go out
[18:22] and we've set our face to god through
[18:24] prayers and supplications to find out
[18:27] lord what's the hour we're living in
[18:30] we've seen all these different things
[18:31] happening
[18:32] we see the world in chaos we see the
[18:35] time at hand
[18:36] the sand writings on the wall everything
[18:39] that god said we hear our president
[18:41] speaking of another wall right now
[18:43] coming
[18:43] we hear prediction is in the often a few
[18:47] hours after
[18:48] war is predicted that nations will be
[18:50] nothing but volcanic dust and we know we
[18:52] got it
[18:53] so we know before that takes place the
[18:56] church has got to go
[18:58] so lord where are we at
[19:03] that's reason i believe that he'll let
[19:05] us know we set our faces to find out
[19:08] now first let's find out 70 weeks harder
[19:12] terminal 9 people holy city to finish
[19:14] the transgression
[19:16] making the end of sin and
[19:19] uh to make reconciliations for iniquity
[19:23] to bring in everlasting righteousness to
[19:26] seal up the vision
[19:27] and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[19:31] that was the sixth full purpose of the
[19:34] visitation
[19:36] of gabriel now
[19:39] let's start number one if you want to
[19:41] mark it you've got pencils number one
[19:44] to finish the transgression that's the
[19:46] first thing
[19:48] now to finish the transgressions
[19:53] of israel who transgressed against
[19:57] god will be the turning away of the
[20:00] ungodliness of jacob
[20:02] now to find this let's turn to romans
[20:06] the 11th chapter of romans
[20:10] and begin
[20:13] with the 21st verse
[20:17] of romans 11. now we're going to what
[20:21] finish the transgressions
[20:25] romans 11 21
[20:29] all right far if god
[20:33] spared not the natural branch which was
[20:38] who
[20:39] israel take heed let's also
[20:43] spare not thee now i want you when you
[20:46] go home and
[20:46] read this whole 11th chapter in this
[20:48] reading this sort mark down the whole
[20:50] 11th chapter and read it
[20:53] spare not thee behold
[20:57] therefore the goodness sirty of god
[21:02] on them which fell
[21:05] but towards the goodness if thou
[21:07] continue
[21:08] in the goodness otherwise thou shalt
[21:12] be cut off also be cut off and they
[21:16] also if they abide not still enough if
[21:19] they
[21:19] abide not stealing unbelief shall be
[21:23] grafted in for god
[21:26] is able to grasp them in again
[21:30] amen see telling that
[21:33] there will be a time that when the
[21:35] gentile will be
[21:37] cut out and israel come back in again
[21:42] for if thou were cut out of the
[21:45] other olive tree which is wild by nature
[21:48] gentiles and were drastic
[21:53] contrary to nature we were
[21:56] contrary to nature aliens without mercy
[22:00] without god
[22:01] with no hope at all and god
[22:04] by his mercy to give us a chance
[22:08] cut off righteous israel because of
[22:11] transgressions and
[22:12] turned them aside throughout the tamil
[22:15] tree
[22:16] and brought in a wild olive tree
[22:21] contrary to nature onto
[22:24] a good tree how much more
[22:28] shall these which be the natural
[22:31] branches be
[22:32] grafted into their own olive tree
[22:38] all right let's read all
[22:42] for i would not brethren that you should
[22:45] be ignorant of this
[22:46] mystery lest you should be wise in your
[22:49] own conceit
[22:51] that blindness and part of happiness
[22:56] of israel has this to israel
[22:59] until the fullness of the gentiles come
[23:02] in
[23:04] until god is finished with the gentiles
[23:07] israel was blinded
[23:11] they went off into sin and to
[23:15] transgressions against god because
[23:19] god blinded their eyes that
[23:22] we might be grafted in amen
[23:26] amen you get it
[23:29] 26 verse now and
[23:33] so all israel shall
[23:36] be saved amen
[23:40] amen god blinded them
[23:43] purposely for you and i they cannot see
[23:47] because
[23:48] god's blinded them and
[23:51] all israel true israel shall
[23:55] be saved what did the angel say
[23:59] lord they'll finish the transgression
[24:02] of israel i come to tell you
[24:06] that there all come a time when the
[24:08] angels transgressions will be finished
[24:11] amen god will cut off that wild branch
[24:15] and draft into that back
[24:16] that real branches amen
[24:20] or sometimes it makes my heart jump
[24:24] see i'm poor miserable
[24:27] people cut off i don't know not knowing
[24:29] where they're going and think that
[24:31] god in his mercy did that so i could be
[24:34] saved
[24:34] amen blinded their eyes from their own
[24:37] messiah
[24:40] shut their ears up that they could not
[24:42] hear him yet looked out of these
[24:43] miracles and looked
[24:44] at these miracles and things that he was
[24:46] doing
[24:47] matthew the 12th chapter 8 or 12th
[24:50] chapter
[24:51] said though jesus had done so many
[24:54] miracles
[24:55] yet they could not believe
[24:58] because god said they got eyes and they
[25:00] can't see in ears and they can't hear
[25:03] unless they would see with their eyes
[25:04] and hear with their ears and i would
[25:06] convert them
[25:08] but so that we could have a chance
[25:11] he pulled the curtain down over his own
[25:13] children's eyes
[25:14] amen turn these old children away from
[25:18] the table
[25:20] and turn them off the leanness of spirit
[25:23] that he might find
[25:25] that we might have a chance to live
[25:28] given us life 26th verse again
[25:33] and so all israel shall be saved that it
[25:37] is written
[25:39] there shall come out of zion
[25:43] they deliver and shall turn away
[25:47] ungodliness from jacob amen
[25:51] yes he will come to mount zion one of
[25:54] these days upon the mount of
[25:57] olives they'll recognize him and all
[26:00] israel
[26:00] knows him
[26:04] the gentiles will be finished then that
[26:07] branch
[26:08] that's been grafted in god will take
[26:10] from it's the fruit that's been gathered
[26:12] and that wild branch will be and i
[26:15] remember all back in here as you read
[26:17] he said if that roots was holy
[26:22] and that roots was a holy root also the
[26:26] fruit that comes up from that holy root
[26:28] will
[26:28] bring holy fruit
[26:30] [Music]
[26:31] and if that root was jesus christ
[26:34] through his book ruth and offspring of
[26:36] david
[26:38] if that life is in him come up to the
[26:41] jewish generation and must call from
[26:43] them
[26:44] and their eyes blinded it we might see
[26:46] our
[26:47] lives will have to pattern with that
[26:49] blessed branch
[26:52] oh yes brother it's right
[26:56] amen god cut them off purposely and
[26:58] blind to their eyes so we could have a
[27:00] chance to see
[27:02] giving us an opportunity we walk around
[27:04] like when somebody paul tells him you're
[27:06] take heed how you do that yes man
[27:10] take heed for god's spare not the
[27:12] natural branch
[27:14] how will he have any more mercy on the
[27:16] wild branch that's already
[27:19] so we walk around say i'm presbyterian
[27:21] i'm methodist i'm baptized pentecostal
[27:24] that don't mean nothing to god amen
[27:27] you've got to be born again of that holy
[27:32] spirit
[27:35] but he come i remember he's not speaking
[27:38] of the gentiles
[27:40] i'm just throwing this in here so you
[27:41] see where the gentiles had their chance
[27:44] but he come to finish the
[27:47] transgression make a finish of it
[27:52] now if we go back into daniel again
[28:04] you
