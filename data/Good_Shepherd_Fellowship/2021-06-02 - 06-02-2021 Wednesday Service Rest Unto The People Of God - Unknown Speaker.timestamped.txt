[52:40] praise the lord we thank the lord for
[52:43] [Music]
[52:44] our brother israel and his family coming

[52:48] they were the speakers on the weekend
[52:50] and
[52:51] we went to support the the service
[52:55] praise the lord amen we also
[52:59] realized that you also had a good
[53:01] service here we were able to
[53:03] follow the service uh and then and see
[53:06] what was happening home
[53:08] so uh uh praise the lord
[53:12] amen
[53:16] you know i believe that
[53:19] uh uh
[53:22] solomon said this in proverbs
[53:26] chapter 15
[53:30] proverbs 15 verse 23 he said
[53:35] a man have joy
[53:38] by the answer of his mouth and
[53:42] a word spoken in due season
[53:46] how good it is
[53:50] praise the lord a man
[53:53] has joy
[53:56] you know when you when you give when you
[53:59] give
[54:00] an answer to a question
[54:03] and sometimes this kind of answer that
[54:06] gives you
[54:07] joy i'm not a ones
[54:12] okay the other ones were
[54:15] you were not even thinking about the
[54:17] answer
[54:19] and you just said it now if this is not
[54:21] like a quiz
[54:22] this is not like uh you studying the
[54:26] message and we come and question you
[54:28] or you've made it no this is just
[54:32] uh uh uh in in conversation you are you
[54:35] are saying
[54:36] something and the lord just
[54:40] help you to say it the right way
[54:43] and sometimes you are even surprised of
[54:45] yourself
[54:46] wow i didn't believe that i said that
[54:49] you know it is not you you know your
[54:51] intelligence does not reach that level
[54:54] praise the lord amen i catch myself many
[54:58] times like that because i know
[55:00] i'm one of the dumbest man around amen
[55:03] but you know like like the scripture
[55:06] says here
[55:07] a word spoken in due season
[55:12] you know brother brandon christian
[55:14] message called spiritual food
[55:15] in due season and we believe that the
[55:18] message of the
[55:19] hour is spiritual food in due season
[55:22] praise the lord so we believe that the
[55:25] the word that god has given to us
[55:28] in this day is the right word
[55:32] spoken for this day amen is the right
[55:35] word that word is enough to be able to
[55:38] address all our situation to answer all
[55:41] of our questions heal all of our
[55:43] sicknesses
[55:44] give us faith for the rapture praise the
[55:48] lord
[55:49] so we see that the message of the hour
[55:51] is
[55:52] a spoken word in due season and solomon
[55:56] said
[55:56] how good it is amen
[56:00] praise the lord and
[56:03] uh and and tonight
[56:06] i want to take a a little talk i just
[56:09] want to show
[56:10] a little principle there let's take uh
[56:13] something also in a book of ecclesiastic
[56:17] i've spoken on that before let's go to
[56:20] to to uh
[56:24] i think that's chapter five
[56:30] i think that's chapter five
[56:35] and i just want to i just want to use
[56:37] that
[56:39] uh
[56:42] after the book of proverbs ecclesiastes
[56:45] chapter 5 verse 1 says keep their
[56:47] fault when thou goeth to the house of
[56:51] god
[56:53] and be more ready to year
[56:56] then to give the sacrifice of force
[57:00] for the considering that that they do
[57:03] evil
[57:04] praise the lord amen keep that fought
[57:09] when they are going to the house of god
[57:12] now
[57:13] you see here uh uh
[57:17] [Music]
[57:20] this this uh uh
[57:25] over in uh in uh in the amplified bible
[57:30] is written like this let me read there
[57:32] for you keep their fault
[57:33] give your mind to what you are doing
[57:40] because if if you read it just like the
[57:44] way
[57:44] that the king james say to us keep that
[57:47] fault
[57:48] you think maybe it is just this
[57:54] quiet walk
[57:57] we have to realize that uh the way
[58:00] we worship the way we think and
[58:03] everything that we are doing
[58:04] is our walk before the lord the way we
[58:08] pray
[58:10] it's our walk it's not only the action
[58:13] of moving your legs but
[58:14] the things that you do in the house of
[58:17] god
[58:18] the way you control your thoughts
[58:22] because there is one person that should
[58:25] have our attention
[58:26] is the lord jesus
[58:30] it's not what the neighbor is doing it's
[58:32] not it's not even what the children are
[58:34] doing
[58:36] we're supposed to be by the grace of god
[58:38] so disciplined that we can be
[58:40] able to live our spiritual attention
[58:43] above every destruction
[58:48] praise the lord keep your foot give your
[58:52] mind to what
[58:53] you are doing when you go
[58:57] as sorry as jacob
[59:01] to secret belter
[59:04] praise the lord is strange never even
[59:06] read this to uh from the amplifier today
[59:09] but i was
[59:10] i was praying and i was i was thinking
[59:11] on that same thing
[59:13] i was just telling the lord i said you
[59:16] met
[59:16] jacob in an unusual place
[59:20] he just stopped by to pray and and
[59:24] and saw a rock and he knelt down on the
[59:26] rock
[59:27] and god came down and met him there
[59:29] praise the lord
[59:31] as jacob on the sacred delta
[59:35] to the house of god for to draw nigh to
[59:39] yield
[59:39] and to obey is better than to give the
[59:42] sacrifice of fool
[59:45] carelessly irreverently
[59:49] too ignorant to know that they
[59:52] are doing evil when people
[59:56] just come to church just to show up
[1:00:00] or come to church just to gather what to
[1:00:03] go home and talk about
[1:00:04] than talking about the word but what we
[1:00:07] want to talk we want to look at here
[1:00:09] tonight is
[1:00:10] that that principle of keeping your
[1:00:13] fault watching your step
[1:00:14] mining the things that you do as you go
[1:00:18] into the house of the lord i want to
[1:00:19] take a principle here
[1:00:21] from uh from the book of ruth now see
[1:00:24] your roof
[1:00:26] now i mean is talking to her
[1:00:27] daughter-in-law
[1:00:29] say with all that you have done for me
[1:00:31] all the service the kindness
[1:00:33] that you have shown to me praise the
[1:00:36] lord
[1:00:37] shall i now seek rest for thee
[1:00:41] praise the lord amen now
[1:00:44] you have to look at we you have to look
[1:00:47] at uh uh
[1:00:49] uh you look at the scripture like this
[1:00:51] you have to actually look at who
[1:00:53] is speaking here and that's the way
[1:00:57] that the word of god blesses you because
[1:00:59] sometimes we get
[1:01:01] so much into the story we look at naomi
[1:01:04] we look at roof
[1:01:05] and it's hard for us to see who actually
[1:01:08] is speaking
[1:01:08] we have to realize that these people
[1:01:11] were under the inspiration of the
[1:01:12] almighty god
[1:01:14] amen many times they spoke in the first
[1:01:18] person
[1:01:20] and the first person of the scripture
[1:01:23] is not now me
[1:01:26] the first person is god
[1:01:31] praise the lord so if now me said
[1:01:34] shall i not find
[1:01:37] not find rest now you think about it in
[1:01:41] your mind
[1:01:42] this walmart she just came from enzyme
[1:01:45] she lost
[1:01:46] everything so think about it on her
[1:01:48] inspiration
[1:01:49] how can she find rest for another person
[1:01:54] how can she ever make her more
[1:01:56] comfortable than herself
[1:02:00] she don't have nothing for herself she
[1:02:02] just returned back
[1:02:03] even though this is her homeland so you
[1:02:05] have to see
[1:02:06] how god almighty god
[1:02:10] like brother branham said christ is a
[1:02:11] mystery of god revealed
[1:02:13] he said god used those people in the old
[1:02:17] testament they never even knew
[1:02:19] that they were on the an inspiration of
[1:02:22] god
[1:02:24] she's speaking right here in the place
[1:02:27] of the first person
[1:02:29] this is god speaking through her
[1:02:32] i will find rest for thee
[1:02:39] praise the lord amen
[1:02:44] you see that all through the scripture
[1:02:49] moses wrote
[1:02:52] the first five books of the bible
[1:02:56] he wrote about his own death he wrote
[1:02:59] about his own birth
[1:03:02] now but when moses was writing
[1:03:05] and as he narrated the story you realize
[1:03:09] that
[1:03:10] he's talking about himself but he put
[1:03:14] himself
[1:03:15] in the third person
[1:03:20] praise the lord i'm here to preach i'm
[1:03:24] not here to teach english grammar amen
[1:03:28] praise the lord but it's just for for us
[1:03:31] to see
[1:03:33] how you know brother branham says god
[1:03:36] is in acts
[1:03:39] there is a there is a beautiful
[1:03:42] at work that is in the scripture
[1:03:47] that if you if you get the principle of
[1:03:50] hate
[1:03:51] i mean the voice of god can come right
[1:03:54] out of the bible to your soul
[1:03:58] let's continue tonight she said my
[1:04:01] daughter
[1:04:03] shah ah nah fine rest for them
[1:04:07] that it may be well with thee
[1:04:11] praise the lord amen
[1:04:15] now she's sending her over to boss
[1:04:19] this was the feast before uh
[1:04:22] uh uh the bali harvest you know after
[1:04:26] the barley harvest they have a feast of
[1:04:28] you know a big face
[1:04:29] so uh she's sending naomi now
[1:04:32] down to the feast but there are three
[1:04:36] principles that i want for us to watch
[1:04:39] here tonight
[1:04:41] in finding rest three principle
[1:04:45] in finding race now remember now naomi
[1:04:49] is telling ruth
[1:04:54] shall i not find rest for thee
[1:04:57] and rest for the believer is the holy
[1:05:00] ghost
[1:05:03] amen are we together
[1:05:07] rest for the believer is the holy ghost
[1:05:12] that's what paul told us
[1:05:15] in the book of hebrew amen
[1:05:19] and yeri said she's going to
[1:05:22] she's going to show naomi a principal
[1:05:28] oh when i saw this it was so beautiful
[1:05:31] it was so beautiful
[1:05:34] she says you go down there the night
[1:05:38] of the feast and the threshing flow
[1:05:43] and this is the three principle
[1:05:46] she said wash thyself
[1:05:51] that's the first principle
[1:05:55] anoint thyself
[1:06:00] that's the second principle
[1:06:05] and change
[1:06:09] that remain for you to have
[1:06:13] rest yes praise the lord
[1:06:17] now you can just see how the holy spirit
[1:06:20] this is redemption
[1:06:21] this is this is the the biggest
[1:06:24] redemption
[1:06:25] story in the bible
[1:06:26] [Laughter]
[1:06:28] just like how we spoke about ruth
[1:06:32] you can look at this and uh you can
[1:06:35] place it in the three stages of grace
[1:06:37] you can i mean you can just do whatever
[1:06:40] you want to do with the scripture
[1:06:41] and just enjoy it for yourself but just
[1:06:44] wash this now
[1:06:45] as we would just study together wash
[1:06:47] thyself
[1:06:51] anoint thy self
[1:06:56] and change your women
[1:07:00] if you want to have rest if you want to
[1:07:04] enjoy the blessing of redemption
[1:07:08] if you really want to to
[1:07:11] enjoy the blessings of the kingsman
[1:07:14] redeemer
[1:07:16] these other things to do
[1:07:20] and she said all that you have said
[1:07:25] i will do
[1:07:31] praise the lord are we together
[1:07:34] now these three uh
[1:07:38] uh uh steps or these three principles
[1:07:41] are very major you see them all over in
[1:07:44] the scripture
[1:07:45] we look a few types in the bible and and
[1:07:48] we read some few things from the prophet
[1:07:50] tonight if we if a time we allow us
[1:07:52] but you you will see that uh she's
[1:07:56] talking about finding rest for now me
[1:08:00] where she would get to the place where
[1:08:03] she will be established
[1:08:05] she will get to the place where she will
[1:08:07] no longer
[1:08:08] be a stranger she will she will she will
[1:08:11] be accepted in the beloved
[1:08:15] praise the lord she will be
[1:08:18] accepted in the beloved she will come
[1:08:21] under the blessing
[1:08:22] of abraham isaac and jacob
[1:08:26] i will find rest for thee
[1:08:30] but you should wash yourself that's the
[1:08:33] first tank
[1:08:35] you must wash yourself
[1:08:40] praise the lord amen
[1:08:43] well i i think you all know where i'm
[1:08:45] going with there because that's the
[1:08:47] purpose of the preaching of the word
[1:08:50] is the watching of the water
[1:08:53] by the word of god
[1:08:57] praise the lord so every time we come to
[1:09:00] service
[1:09:01] we come for the bath
[1:09:04] i don't care what what you use to take
[1:09:07] bath
[1:09:08] it's not enough for god he has to use
[1:09:11] this word
[1:09:12] to watch you if you want to find
[1:09:16] rest and that's the reason why many
[1:09:20] people
[1:09:21] uh around the christian church cannot
[1:09:24] find rest
[1:09:25] because because i mean uh uh
[1:09:28] they they we we get so comfortable
[1:09:31] you know uh in in our dress code or
[1:09:34] whatever
[1:09:35] you know the way we prepare ourselves
[1:09:37] and people come to the house of god
[1:09:40] and and and the their mind is looking
[1:09:43] elsewhere they are looking for something
[1:09:45] looking for something uh magical to take
[1:09:48] place they are looking
[1:09:50] you know like god would just do
[1:09:51] something a million dollars will fall in
[1:09:53] your lap
[1:09:54] or god would just do something you know
[1:09:55] their their their their struggling habit
[1:09:58] would just
[1:09:59] fly away but god has his principle
[1:10:05] amen
[1:10:08] when we come to the house of god that's
[1:10:10] the first thing that is
[1:10:12] that should be on our mind i'm going to
[1:10:15] get a
[1:10:16] good watch by the water
[1:10:19] of the world
[1:10:25] it's a step of grace
[1:10:28] it's a step of redemption
[1:10:34] you look there in uh leviticus chapter
[1:10:37] eight
[1:10:37] you realize that even when god was going
[1:10:41] to take
[1:10:43] aaron and his sons into the priesthood
[1:10:47] the first thing he asks moses to do you
[1:10:49] must wash them
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:53] you must wash them
[1:10:57] washing is very important and that's
[1:11:01] what we don't like
[1:11:04] we like to come to the house of god and
[1:11:06] be entertained
[1:11:09] and you know and and
[1:11:12] you know and just like that but the
[1:11:14] purpose of the word
[1:11:15] the purpose of the preaching of the word
[1:11:19] is to find something in our life to
[1:11:21] cleanse
[1:11:22] us sometimes it's not a physical thing
[1:11:25] sometimes it's a
[1:11:27] mental thing
[1:11:35] sometimes is to take us away from all
[1:11:38] teachings
[1:11:42] god wants to watch our mind
[1:11:46] and take us away from a denominational
[1:11:49] teaching
[1:11:50] and bring us to rapturing
[1:11:54] rapturing faith rapturing expectation
[1:12:02] shall i not find rest for thee
[1:12:06] you left your loved ones
[1:12:12] you left the land of moabite
[1:12:15] praise the lord it was your own
[1:12:19] confession
[1:12:20] your god will be my god your people will
[1:12:23] be my people
[1:12:25] and you came down here with everything
[1:12:27] they have said about you they criticize
[1:12:29] you
[1:12:30] i mean they call you all sorts of names
[1:12:32] but yet instead you went
[1:12:34] in the field and you glean
[1:12:39] shall i not find rest
[1:12:43] for you praise the lord
[1:12:49] oh i believe that god is surely going to
[1:12:51] give a rest to his people
[1:12:54] amen with everything that we have gone
[1:12:58] through and we are going through
[1:13:01] praise the lord there is a rest
[1:13:05] unto the people of god
[1:13:09] praise the lord if we would just follow
[1:13:12] god
[1:13:13] if we would follow god step and we will
[1:13:16] follow his instruction to rest
[1:13:19] we will have rest in many areas of our
[1:13:21] life but the thing about it there is
[1:13:23] that
[1:13:23] we create in our mind our own way we
[1:13:26] think that we can get rest
[1:13:31] praise the lord
[1:13:39] we con ourselves and say some and then
[1:13:42] the first stage of grace is
[1:13:43] justification and the second stage of
[1:13:46] grace is sanctification and the test
[1:13:48] sister of grace is the baptism of the
[1:13:49] holy ghost i believe the mercy i'm
[1:13:51] justified i'm not
[1:13:52] you know i'm i'm not in the word anymore
[1:13:54] i'm sanctified
[1:13:55] and and uh i believe i have the holy
[1:13:58] ghost
[1:13:59] and all of those things are wonderful
[1:14:02] they are wonderful but yet
[1:14:06] if we'll be earnest to ourself we'll
[1:14:09] realize
[1:14:10] there are areas in our lives
[1:14:15] that we need rest
[1:14:20] there are areas in our life
[1:14:25] that we can't wait to say oh
[1:14:29] jesus thank you thank you
[1:14:32] thank you i'm over with this
[1:14:36] but there is a rest unto the people of
[1:14:40] god
[1:14:42] this is redemption rest
[1:14:46] praise the lord naomi was sending
[1:14:49] roof on a risky mission
[1:14:53] she won her don't let the men to see you
[1:14:58] she was going on a risky mission
[1:15:02] she was going to provoke her redemption
[1:15:09] she was going to provoke her redemption
[1:15:13] because she was going to the tent of
[1:15:16] boss
[1:15:20] well after the feast after they have
[1:15:22] danced and they ate and they drank
[1:15:25] and then and the music has gone down and
[1:15:28] they are all
[1:15:28] tired and sleepy she was going to snake
[1:15:32] in the tent and watch to see where boris
[1:15:40] was lying and she would pick up
[1:15:45] his blanket at his feet
[1:15:48] and just uncover his feet in a sense
[1:15:51] just
[1:15:51] pick his blanket up and just sit right
[1:15:54] at his feet
[1:15:58] praise the lord oh i believe he fed the
[1:16:01] corners of her feet
[1:16:03] yes who's that
[1:16:06] it was a risky mission
[1:16:11] but that's the way she was going to get
[1:16:13] rest
[1:16:18] that's the way she was going to get rest
[1:16:24] she had to rake something
[1:16:27] but before she get to that risky part of
[1:16:29] it uncovering his feet
[1:16:31] these are the three things that she must
[1:16:33] do
[1:16:35] you love the lord tonight praise the
[1:16:38] lord
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:46] glory be to god
[1:16:49] let's let's look at something here a
[1:16:51] little bit i'm coming back to those
[1:16:53] three things
[1:16:54] you know that's that's what i do i never
[1:16:56] finish what i'm preaching i mean
[1:16:58] i just keep running from one end to
[1:17:01] but it just it just gave me the
[1:17:03] opportunity to preach more amen
[1:17:05] let's look here also in ii samuel
[1:17:08] chapter 12
[1:17:10] glory be to god second samuel chapter
[1:17:14] 12.
[1:17:17] amen are we together
[1:17:21] amen now while you're staying in second
[1:17:24] simon chapter 12 let me read something
[1:17:26] here from
[1:17:27] from brother branham
[1:17:32] redeemer redemption
[1:17:36] now is advising us to read the old
[1:17:39] testament
[1:17:40] he advised us back there
[1:17:44] when man done wrong god may have
[1:17:48] punished him for it
[1:17:50] when a man done wrong god
[1:17:53] when the men don't write god blessed him
[1:17:56] for it
[1:17:57] so ruth was being advised by naomi
[1:18:01] the old church now brother branham is
[1:18:04] holding redemption here
[1:18:05] typing lord and grace typing the old
[1:18:08] church
[1:18:09] and the new church with ruth and now
[1:18:12] meaning ruth
[1:18:13] the old church what she must do
[1:18:17] so when it come time
[1:18:20] for the great feats
[1:18:24] right after harvest
[1:18:29] and that's what is on now the great
[1:18:32] feast so brother branham is typing
[1:18:36] what is happening here in another sense
[1:18:39] he's typing
[1:18:40] the opening of the word as the great
[1:18:42] feast
[1:18:46] the six ages has labor
[1:18:49] amen now we have come to the great feast
[1:18:54] where
[1:18:54] the message of god is revealed
[1:18:57] praise the lord amen
[1:19:01] so he said that's what is going on now
[1:19:02] the great feast and watch
[1:19:05] what ruth vent she goes down
[1:19:08] and fix herself all up
[1:19:11] and make herself look pretty and clean
[1:19:16] she fix herself all up by
[1:19:20] watching anointing
[1:19:23] and changing her garment praise the lord
[1:19:28] now because that there is something that
[1:19:31] is hidden in here
[1:19:32] uh uh i i'll keep that one let me go let
[1:19:35] me
[1:19:36] let me deal with the first one first uh
[1:19:38] watching which is the watching
[1:19:39] of the world about the word you know and
[1:19:42] and that's what we do every time
[1:19:43] the word is preached to us but then
[1:19:46] after the word is
[1:19:47] preached we create an atmosphere
[1:19:51] amen the word is being preached
[1:19:55] for an atmosphere to be created the
[1:19:57] preacher is preaching
[1:19:58] you are seeing it in a scripture you say
[1:20:00] amen thank you jesus oh lord
[1:20:03] help me watch me you know father i i
[1:20:06] suppose this place of my life
[1:20:08] now when we when we have that kind of
[1:20:10] attitude
[1:20:11] like like solomon said there in in in
[1:20:14] ecclesiastes we are watching our feet
[1:20:16] how we are moving in the house of god
[1:20:18] not sitting down and be
[1:20:19] and being critical and and investigating
[1:20:22] the world in your mind
[1:20:24] of course when the preacher is saying
[1:20:25] something that don't make sense you have
[1:20:27] to investigate it in your mind
[1:20:28] but i mean when the word is coming we
[1:20:31] are creating an atmosphere
[1:20:33] and and what does that does is that the
[1:20:36] atmosphere you create by responding to
[1:20:38] the word
[1:20:39] in your spirit and receiving that word
[1:20:42] it draws the holy ghost down
[1:20:46] then an anointing comes in the service
[1:20:51] praise the lord after the word being
[1:20:54] preached sometimes
[1:20:56] it does not take one hour i mean jesus
[1:20:59] said he that wash his feet his whole
[1:21:01] body is clean
[1:21:02] god just need to touch something in your
[1:21:04] life
[1:21:05] and you say amen lord yeah am i it draws
[1:21:08] the anointing down
[1:21:14] praise the lord amen
[1:21:17] you see these things they are not things
[1:21:19] that you can master with your mind
[1:21:23] the moment we start putting our mind to
[1:21:25] it and says okay
[1:21:26] okay yeah okay there then then i think i
[1:21:29] gotta take back with two buckets of
[1:21:30] water before i go to church
[1:21:32] because i really need to be watched
[1:21:36] glory be to god praise the lord
[1:21:40] amen that's when god is going to send an
[1:21:42] evangelist and tell you how long you're
[1:21:44] staying in the bathroom
[1:21:48] praise him glory be to god
[1:21:52] now so you see it's these things are
[1:21:55] spiritual
[1:21:58] amen half of the things and
[1:22:02] and that that take place in the service
[1:22:04] when we come
[1:22:05] in here and we sit down and we prayed
[1:22:08] and the music is playing
[1:22:10] and we come and sing and uh uh uh
[1:22:14] i mean most of the things that typically
[1:22:16] the majority of the things that take
[1:22:18] place
[1:22:18] in the service they are all spiritual
[1:22:24] praise the lord
[1:22:28] we labor we labor we pray we sing
[1:22:31] the musicians try to play right the song
[1:22:33] leader try to sing right
[1:22:35] we clap our hands we create an
[1:22:37] atmosphere
[1:22:38] i mean sometimes people think it's just
[1:22:40] emotion you just
[1:22:41] you know we just sing fast song and we
[1:22:43] get get a place hot and says
[1:22:45] oh yeah the service was moving today
[1:22:46] that just working that that does not
[1:22:48] have anything to do with
[1:22:50] it it's the way we order ourselves
[1:22:58] it's the way we order ourselves in the
[1:23:01] house of god
[1:23:02] we have our mind on christ
[1:23:07] we don't see your brother in church we
[1:23:10] pray for him we don't see your sister
[1:23:12] we prayed and said lord i don't know why
[1:23:14] it's been a while i didn't see this
[1:23:16] brother lord i committed me to your
[1:23:17] hands whatever
[1:23:18] is going on around his life the way we
[1:23:22] order ourselves
[1:23:30] and then the word comes praise the lord
[1:23:37] a word spoken in season
[1:23:41] the preacher can come pick up anything
[1:23:44] to talk about
[1:23:46] that he had placed before god that is
[1:23:48] that is anointed he has
[1:23:49] warmed under the under the presence of
[1:23:51] prayer and the holy spirit
[1:23:54] god is going to take something from that
[1:23:56] word
[1:24:00] either to address something in your life
[1:24:02] or to edify you
[1:24:05] praise the lord or maybe the heavenly
[1:24:08] father might come back and just pet you
[1:24:10] on the back and says
[1:24:11] i love what you are doing by something
[1:24:13] the preacher said
[1:24:18] no that's that should not give you the
[1:24:19] attitude to raise your shoulder and feed
[1:24:21] that now you are spiritual
[1:24:24] but you can just pray in your heart lord
[1:24:25] help me
[1:24:30] help me lord keep me humble
[1:24:36] so that's the first step to rest
[1:24:42] that's the first step to rest is to be
[1:24:45] watched
[1:24:47] the first step to rest is to be watched
[1:24:54] we have to be watched of our ideas watch
[1:24:57] of our attitude
[1:25:00] our nature needs to be watched our brain
[1:25:04] needs to be watched
[1:25:07] praise the lord that's the purpose of
[1:25:10] the word
[1:25:12] and you know that's the reason why even
[1:25:14] jesus uh uh uh
[1:25:16] there the under the the the commission
[1:25:18] there in the
[1:25:19] in acts repent and be baptized
[1:25:22] and you shall receive what the gift of
[1:25:25] the holy ghost
[1:25:26] because right after watching every time
[1:25:29] god's watch you
[1:25:30] he's not going to leave you dry
[1:25:34] he's going to come down and anoint you
[1:25:39] praise the lord every time he watch you
[1:25:44] when the lord rebuked you and and and
[1:25:47] point out something in your life and
[1:25:49] and and and and you you know he just he
[1:25:52] just
[1:25:52] he just trouble your heart and just pull
[1:25:54] your heart apart
[1:25:55] and your heart feels so broken you cry
[1:25:57] before god he always have a way to come
[1:26:00] back
[1:26:00] and comfort you
[1:26:05] he's not a god that just come and just
[1:26:07] rebuke you and tell you how
[1:26:09] how uh disappointed he is in you and
[1:26:12] just leave you
[1:26:13] hot and dry no
[1:26:17] you always come around and he comforts
[1:26:20] you
[1:26:21] what is the comforter the holy ghost is
[1:26:23] a comforter so every comfort of god is a
[1:26:26] sense of anointing you with oil
[1:26:30] praise the lord
[1:26:34] so we deal with the watching and the
[1:26:36] anointing but let's look here in ii
[1:26:39] samuel now
[1:26:40] uh before i lost my time here
[1:26:44] praise the lord now
[1:26:47] ii samuel chapter 12 here brings us to
[1:26:50] the story of where david
[1:26:51] fell with the uh the sheba and and the
[1:26:54] shiva had a child
[1:26:56] and and nathan came in and nathan
[1:26:58] rebuked david and all of that
[1:27:00] and then we realized that the child was
[1:27:02] sick
[1:27:04] the bible says the child was sick unto
[1:27:06] death
[1:27:08] which means the child was very sick
[1:27:11] and david went and then
[1:27:14] he led himself seven days
[1:27:19] oh uh uh he laid himself before the lord
[1:27:25] verse 16 and david therefore besought
[1:27:30] god for the child and he fasted
[1:27:33] and went in in lay all night
[1:27:37] upon the earth verse 18 and it came to
[1:27:41] pass
[1:27:42] on the seventh day that the child died
[1:27:48] praise the lord amen
[1:27:52] verse 20 that's what i want to bring us
[1:27:54] to
[1:27:56] then david arose from the earth
[1:28:01] and washed and
[1:28:04] anointed himself and changed
[1:28:09] his apparel
[1:28:12] praise the lord
[1:28:16] can we say praise the lord glory be to
[1:28:19] god
[1:28:19] [Applause]
[1:28:29] now follow follow the follow the reading
[1:28:32] a little bit
[1:28:35] because it surprised everybody
[1:28:39] after the child died the bible said
[1:28:42] david woke up from the earth he went he
[1:28:44] washed himself
[1:28:45] he anointed himself he changed his
[1:28:47] clothes he worshipped the lord
[1:28:49] he came in and and started while david
[1:28:52] was on a such a birthday
[1:28:55] he was on a such a burden the burden of
[1:28:58] his guilt the wrong that he had done
[1:29:00] he was thinking about uriah's and all of
[1:29:02] this burden
[1:29:03] the burden of sin was so much on this
[1:29:06] man
[1:29:06] he was just crying to god for mercy
[1:29:13] praise the lord but somewhere
[1:29:17] in there somewhere in there
[1:29:25] let's read a little bit
[1:29:30] and david arose from the earth he
[1:29:32] watched himself anoint himself
[1:29:34] and changed his appearance and came into
[1:29:37] the house of the lord
[1:29:39] and worshiped then he came to his
[1:29:43] own house and when
[1:29:46] he and when he required
[1:29:50] that the set bread before him and he did
[1:29:53] it then
[1:29:54] said his servant unto him what thing is
[1:29:57] this that thou
[1:29:58] has done thou they fast and weep for the
[1:30:03] child
[1:30:05] why it was alive but when the child
[1:30:11] was dead that did arise and eat bread
[1:30:15] and he said while the child was yet
[1:30:18] alive i
[1:30:19] fasted and wept for it
[1:30:22] who can tell whether god will be
[1:30:25] gracious to me
[1:30:28] and the child may live
[1:30:31] but now he is dead wherefore should i
[1:30:34] fast
[1:30:36] can i bring him back again shall i
[1:30:39] go to him
[1:30:44] but he shall
[1:30:48] he says sorry i shall go to him but he
[1:30:51] shall not return to me
[1:30:54] and david comforted the shiva
[1:30:57] his wife praise the lord
[1:31:03] glory be to god
[1:31:07] you can see why david
[1:31:11] he was so designed and favored with god
[1:31:15] by god to be able to to display some
[1:31:18] things from the heart of god a man after
[1:31:21] god's
[1:31:21] own heart praise the lord
[1:31:25] amen you can see why
[1:31:28] david will find favor before god
[1:31:33] that true the very same woman bathsheba
[1:31:37] will come solomon
[1:31:40] that will represent the king of kings
[1:31:45] amen
[1:31:51] a son of god that knows what what kind
[1:31:53] of a communion
[1:31:55] that david had with god when he kept his
[1:31:59] face to the earth
[1:32:00] the things he said to god
[1:32:07] the cry that he cried to god and the
[1:32:09] things that he altered
[1:32:11] from his heart
[1:32:15] that he can be able to gather the bible
[1:32:18] says
[1:32:18] he changed himself and went right into
[1:32:21] watching
[1:32:23] right into rest
[1:32:27] he worshiped the lord and he went home
[1:32:30] and
[1:32:30] asked his wife for food and you know
[1:32:32] talking to everybody
[1:32:35] praise the lord i believe during that
[1:32:38] time david was down there god
[1:32:40] was watching him from guilt
[1:32:48] praise the lord because david had to
[1:32:51] walk
[1:32:53] as the king of israel he has to combine
[1:32:56] the ahmed of israel
[1:32:58] the very friends of uriah's
[1:33:01] he have to walk in the city he have to
[1:33:04] he was taking
[1:33:08] praise the lord but you see this when
[1:33:12] god
[1:33:13] has delivered a man from the guilt of
[1:33:16] his sin
[1:33:18] praise the lord you don't have to hang
[1:33:21] your heads down anymore
[1:33:23] praise the lord
[1:33:30] you say i saw yes i saw god has forgiven
[1:33:32] me
[1:33:34] it's not it's not uh it's not in the
[1:33:36] language of boss
[1:33:40] no you can also talk like that and be
[1:33:43] arrogant when you know
[1:33:44] in your heart you have not dealt with
[1:33:47] the problem of guilt
[1:33:53] that's what we spoke about last
[1:33:55] wednesday
[1:33:56] forgiveness god comes and relieves you
[1:33:59] from guilt
[1:34:00] so here we see david also growing into
[1:34:03] that
[1:34:04] same three step it shows that
[1:34:07] there is something there's this there's
[1:34:09] a hidden truth
[1:34:10] there is there's something hidden in
[1:34:12] there about redemption
[1:34:15] and that is a very same step that god
[1:34:18] take us through he watched us by the
[1:34:22] water of the world
[1:34:24] he anoint us and he changed our nature
[1:34:32] he changed our nature we are still
[1:34:34] wearing the same old body
[1:34:36] but he changed us from the inside and
[1:34:39] that is the only way you will find rest
[1:34:43] it comes by the changing from the inside
[1:34:47] you can profess everything you want to
[1:34:49] profess on the outside
[1:34:51] but if that nature inside is not changed
[1:34:56] you will never have rest with yourself
[1:35:03] also every time i want to do good evil
[1:35:06] is present
[1:35:07] oh who shall deliver me from this
[1:35:09] wretched body
[1:35:11] there was a wall going on within himself
[1:35:17] praise the lord now under the lord of
[1:35:20] redemption
[1:35:21] if you go back to the book of exeter you
[1:35:24] you realize that when a woman was
[1:35:27] captured
[1:35:28] in wall the bible says there are things
[1:35:32] that
[1:35:32] that that she would do that was one of
[1:35:35] the one of the time
[1:35:36] in the scripture where the woman would
[1:35:38] have to cut her head and the reason why
[1:35:40] she would do that is because
[1:35:42] it's a sign that she's been taken from
[1:35:45] all of that hair shape
[1:35:46] and she's brought on a new hair shape
[1:35:52] that was the only reason why she would
[1:35:53] do that
[1:35:55] because head was a representation of
[1:35:58] head shape
[1:35:59] but there was another thing that was
[1:36:01] also done in there she has to be
[1:36:03] kept in indoor for a period of time and
[1:36:06] then
[1:36:07] she will have to change her remy now
[1:36:11] that changing of the raymond there are a
[1:36:13] lot of things that is also attached to
[1:36:15] that
[1:36:15] one other thing there is that you have
[1:36:17] to realize
[1:36:18] that ruth she was
[1:36:22] a widow
[1:36:27] and and the way she was dressing
[1:36:30] has to show that she was a widow
[1:36:36] there was a way that that weedos would
[1:36:38] dress
[1:36:39] and you can look immediately and say oh
[1:36:41] my goodness she lost her husband
[1:36:45] praise the lord but now that she was
[1:36:49] going to be redeemed
[1:36:52] she no longer had to be in that widow
[1:36:55] clause
[1:36:59] now she was going to provoke a man to
[1:37:02] redeem her
[1:37:03] oh my goodness i feel like preaching
[1:37:06] glory be to god now man she was going to
[1:37:10] be redeemed
[1:37:13] romans chapter 7
[1:37:16] praise the lord amen
[1:37:20] glory be to god
[1:37:25] paul says no in that brethren for i
[1:37:28] speak to them
[1:37:30] that know the lord how that the lord
[1:37:33] have dominion over the man as long as he
[1:37:36] live it for the woman
[1:37:38] which heart and husband is bound by the
[1:37:41] lord to her husband
[1:37:43] so the the the widow way of dressing was
[1:37:46] something that still bound her to her
[1:37:48] old husband even though
[1:37:50] he was dead but she had to dress that
[1:37:53] way
[1:37:56] so she cannot be mistaken as other women
[1:37:59] also
[1:38:00] i mean young man would not just run
[1:38:03] after her
[1:38:04] she had to she had to preserve that
[1:38:06] respect for her husband
[1:38:11] but now she's going to be redeemed
[1:38:20] praise the lord if ruth
[1:38:23] will have appeared to the feasts dressed
[1:38:26] in her widow garmin
[1:38:29] every man will know that she was another
[1:38:32] man's wife
[1:38:34] she's still be willing her husband
[1:38:40] so she has to change oh god man
[1:38:45] praise the lord but brandon said look
[1:38:47] nice
[1:38:50] she has to clean up and look nice
[1:38:58] praise the lord it's a risky business to
[1:39:01] look nice
[1:39:05] glory be to god are we together
[1:39:12] you love the lord
[1:39:18] amen and he says so ruth was being
[1:39:21] advised by naomi in the old church
[1:39:23] what she must do so so it come time
[1:39:28] for the great feasts and that's what we
[1:39:30] all now the great feast and
[1:39:32] watch what ruth did she goes down
[1:39:35] and fakes herself all up
[1:39:39] ah if she was tying her hair she took
[1:39:42] that thing off and then threw it away
[1:39:44] got before the merit and did all of this
[1:39:47] twist it this way she said
[1:39:50] i'm going to put a do on my hair tonight
[1:39:54] that this that these hebrew girls i've
[1:39:56] never seen
[1:39:59] glory be to god fix herself all
[1:40:02] up and make herself
[1:40:06] look pretty and clean
[1:40:10] pretty and clean
[1:40:16] she has to make sure that it don't fail
[1:40:22] what was she looking for she was looking
[1:40:25] for rest
[1:40:28] she was looking for rest she was
[1:40:31] looking for the holy ghost
[1:40:35] she had to clean herself of every
[1:40:39] filthy thought in her mind
[1:40:42] clean herself up
[1:40:53] praise the lord i believe that's where
[1:40:57] the church supposed to be
[1:41:00] that's where the people ready for a
[1:41:03] rapture supposed to be
[1:41:05] when we lie down on our bed do we ask
[1:41:08] ourselves thank lord
[1:41:10] is this going to be the night
[1:41:15] father maybe i might not wake up
[1:41:18] i might just break up into eternity
[1:41:24] praise the lord
[1:41:29] how do we go to bear with our phones in
[1:41:31] our hands
[1:41:35] and something on facebook is playing you
[1:41:38] are snoring away
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:44] because the phone got tired watching you
[1:41:51] pretty and clean and wind boys
[1:41:54] laid on the floor that night young woman
[1:41:58] beautiful morally righteous
[1:42:01] she had to put
[1:42:05] her confidence in boss
[1:42:09] without ignoring him
[1:42:13] she had to put her confidence
[1:42:17] in boast without ignoring him that's
[1:42:20] that was what
[1:42:21] signifies by her lifting
[1:42:24] his uh his covering at his feet
[1:42:28] and for her to sit at his feet
[1:42:32] the man could get angry
[1:42:36] the man could disgrace you
[1:42:39] so it was a risky business
[1:42:43] praise the lord
[1:42:49] are we together
[1:42:54] my daughter shall i not find rest
[1:42:59] for you think about it how god
[1:43:03] service after service he's trying to
[1:43:07] find

[1:43:10] to bring you to the place where you can
[1:43:13] understand this message

[1:47:16] loving the lord i'm just loving the word
[1:47:19] it's just so beautiful the word this is
[1:47:22] the beauty of the word this
[1:47:24] is the beauty of jesus the bible says
[1:47:27] when we see him there is no beauty
[1:47:29] we should desire of him her physical
[1:47:32] body is not beautiful
[1:47:34] the beauty of jesus is the beauty of his
[1:47:36] word
[1:47:38] amen his physical body is not beautiful
[1:47:45] praise the lord i can sure i can prove
[1:47:48] it to you right in the scripture
[1:47:50] his physical body is now beautiful
[1:47:55] we sing the song you are beautiful
[1:47:57] beyond description
[1:47:59] most of the time people think about the
[1:48:01] physical face of jesus
[1:48:03] they think that's what it is no
[1:48:10] do you know why the why those men on the
[1:48:12] road of immigrants did not recognize him
[1:48:17] you know why they didn't recognize him
[1:48:25] praise the lord
[1:48:29] even though he resurrected
[1:48:33] but one thing you have to keep in your
[1:48:35] mind his
[1:48:37] body was kept in a certain
[1:48:40] state for a memorial
[1:48:46] if jesus still had the scars in his
[1:48:49] hands
[1:48:51] then his face also was disfigured
[1:48:55] because to pull out his being yes
[1:49:01] if he still had the physical scars in
[1:49:03] his hands
[1:49:04] then his face was disfigured
[1:49:09] the resurrection never took the scars
[1:49:11] away from his hands
[1:49:13] why should he change his face
[1:49:20] or i can i can take you through the
[1:49:21] bible
[1:49:26] this is the beauty of jesus the beauty
[1:49:29] of jesus
[1:49:30] is his word
