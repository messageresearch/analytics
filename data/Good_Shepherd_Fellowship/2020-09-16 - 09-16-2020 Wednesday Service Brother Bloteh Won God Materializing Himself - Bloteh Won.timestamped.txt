[49:45] you try to react to it and sometimes you
[49:47] don't
[49:48] you don't have your your best uh
[49:51] it does not bring your best out of you
[49:53] praise the lord
[49:54] and sometimes it's like that with with
[49:56] uh with preaching and with the ministry
[49:59] you know uh sometimes the devil tried to
[50:01] frustrate you and you really want to get
[50:03] on him
[50:04] or sometimes you see he's trying to
[50:06] trouble the people then you you really
[50:08] want to take him into the fight and
[50:10] sometimes you just you just kind of uh
[50:14] you know so i was i was actually
[50:16] thinking about something
[50:17] i thought i said wednesday night okay
[50:19] i'm going to be i'm going to be like an
[50:21] evangelist
[50:22] i i mean i just need i need to drive
[50:25] this thing down i need to i just need to
[50:27] become a little bit but then as i was
[50:30] praying
[50:31] you know the lord starts to help me to
[50:33] understand
[50:35] you know it's not what we do
[50:39] or what we think we want to do praise
[50:43] the lord
[50:44] the the overcoming power is in the
[50:47] revelation of jesus christ
[50:50] praise the lord the more god can help us
[50:53] to start knowing
[50:55] uh uh who he is and what he wants us to
[50:59] be
[51:00] the easy we will that's that's the thing
[51:04] you know like like brother branham says
[51:06] uh
[51:07] the the the messenger of malachi 4
[51:12] and revelation 10 7 will do
[51:15] two things according to malachi 4
[51:20] he will turn the hearts of the father to
[51:23] the children
[51:24] that's what that ministry would do it
[51:28] will bring us back to the bible
[51:31] it will make the bible real to us
[51:34] and the ministry of revelation 10 will
[51:37] now
[51:38] reveal in one sense the ministry of
[51:41] revelation 10
[51:42] will identify us it will be able to
[51:44] point to us
[51:45] just like the angel was doing to john in
[51:48] revelation chapter 6 come and see
[51:51] that's what malachi 4 will do come and
[51:53] see
[51:54] and the the the ministry of revelation
[51:57] 10
[51:58] you know will reveal the mysteries of
[52:00] god and he said
[52:01] is the revealing of the mysteries of god
[52:04] that we
[52:04] literally you know that
[52:07] will literally so the more that god
[52:10] starts to show himself to us
[52:12] and we start to understand what he's
[52:15] doing in our day
[52:17] what he's doing in our life
[52:21] praise the lord that's the thing that
[52:23] that
[52:24] literally turned us back that's the
[52:25] thing that that that make us to
[52:27] appreciate him more and in appreciating
[52:31] him more
[52:33] we we find no reason for us to stick
[52:36] with this word
[52:39] and that's and and and that is the thing
[52:42] that
[52:43] uh you know i've i've been trying
[52:46] you know trying to to say trying to find
[52:49] the right word
[52:50] you know especially for our young people
[52:53] if we can appreciate
[52:55] what god has given to us the privilege
[52:58] that he has given to
[52:59] us to be able to see what he's doing in
[53:02] this day
[53:05] we will have no reason to lost after
[53:08] this word
[53:10] we'll have no reason to crave this word
[53:13] ghost
[53:14] because i'm telling you it's on fire
[53:20] it's on fire with all of the things that
[53:21] is happening
[53:23] the science is all around us jesus said
[53:26] now one stone will be left upon another
[53:28] now that is not to scare you that your
[53:30] house is going to burn that's not what
[53:32] i'm saying
[53:33] praise the lord i'm saying that
[53:37] an hour with all of these things
[53:39] happening
[53:40] we can we can live for our hands and say
[53:44] lord thank you that i know you
[53:48] as my lord and savior
[53:51] thank you that i haven't i have a
[53:54] relationship
[53:55] yes now even if this afflict tabernacle
[53:58] be dissolved i know
[53:59] in the twinkling of an eye i will step
[54:02] into another one
[54:06] whatever this world will take away from
[54:08] me just just like i'm saying
[54:10] i believe i believe they are there there
[54:12] they are good people they are christians
[54:14] that are lost in their home in
[54:15] california
[54:17] in oregon and all of these places i
[54:20] believe they are there they are people
[54:21] that love god
[54:28] praise the lord
[54:32] but it when when there if that inner
[54:35] hope
[54:35] is there when all you have
[54:39] is gone before your eyes you can be able
[54:43] to say like joke
[54:44] naked i came but naked i will not return
[54:49] amen we have a better language than job
[54:51] we're not going by naked we're going
[54:53] with character
[54:54] we will be dressed in his character
[54:58] praise the lord when everything we have
[55:02] is taken away from us
[55:06] there is something that is real that is
[55:09] the thing that we want to get a hold of
[55:11] hallelujah that's the thing we want to
[55:14] get a hold of
[55:17] because that is the only thing that
[55:18] satisfied
[55:23] praise the lord that is the only thing
[55:27] that's satisfying
[55:30] praise the lord amen so i kind of
[55:33] changed my
[55:34] talk tonight i was actually going to
[55:35] speak on uh
[55:37] the family name the family name brings
[55:41] about family resemblance
[55:43] that's what i was going to talk about
[55:45] tonight but
[55:46] i just i just uh i just thought and say
[55:49] well let me
[55:50] let me now let me just stay with this
[55:54] and uh and trust you know uh
[55:59] praise the lord
[56:03] so i will use i will use their crisis
[56:05] mystery of god reveal
[56:07] called tonight and but but this is this
[56:10] is what i was trying to show you
[56:13] jesus said at that day
[56:17] at that day you will know
[56:21] i am in the father
[56:26] at that day you will know that i'm in
[56:29] the father
[56:32] ye in me and i in you now brother
[56:35] branham says this saying that christ is
[56:37] the mystery of god revealed
[56:38] he said jesus said at that day
[56:42] that's this day now
[56:45] that is what is identified in revelation
[56:48] 3
[56:48] 20 the day that he's standing before
[56:53] the door and knocking because he using
[56:55] the very same language
[56:59] i in you you in me i will stop with you
[57:02] and you will stop with me he's using the
[57:06] very same
[57:10] language
[57:12] so the fulfillment of sin john
[57:16] 14 20 is revelation 3 20.
[57:22] revelation 3 20 literally fulfilled
[57:27] barbara says jesus said at that day
[57:31] there's this day at that day
[57:34] when this revelation is made known
[57:39] you will know that i am in the father
[57:44] the father in me are in you
[57:48] and you in me when the
[57:51] revelation is may manifest
[57:55] at that day yes i know that
[57:58] i and the father are one
[58:02] i am in the father the father is
[58:05] in me then when the revelation
[58:09] comes forth then aids
[58:12] are in you and you
[58:16] aiming there you are
[58:20] see the the threefold
[58:23] manifestation that's what he saw the the
[58:26] manifold
[58:27] the threefold for what to bring
[58:30] it back we have got to be
[58:34] praise the lord so we were talking on
[58:37] this
[58:37] revelation of jesus christ uh uh
[58:42] revelation chapter one revelation of
[58:44] jesus christ that god
[58:45] gave to him now see another
[58:49] think that brother branham express you
[58:54] and uh
[59:04] i hope i can be able to get it now i
[59:07] kind of a flip over here
[59:19] are we together amen
[59:24] he says here in
[59:40] the identification 1964
[59:58] identification 1964
[1:00:07] okay let me let's let's look at this and
[1:00:10] the character of god
[1:00:12] was christ he was the reflection
[1:00:17] god he was god made visible
[1:00:21] notice god made visible
[1:00:25] in the beginning was god he wasn't
[1:00:28] even guarding no one
[1:00:32] god an object of worship praise the lord
[1:00:37] he said yeah one thing
[1:00:40] he was was
[1:00:43] the antenna and in him
[1:00:47] was attributes and those attributes
[1:00:51] were thoughts praise the lord
[1:00:56] and those thoughts was expressed to
[1:00:59] worse
[1:01:01] the word was made manifest what is it
[1:01:06] it's all god becoming
[1:01:11] tangible praise the lord
[1:01:15] is all god becoming
[1:01:18] tangible
[1:01:21] glory be to god
[1:01:25] and uh let's let's take this also
[1:01:29] uh sister faith sorry we will see jesus
[1:01:33] he says this i think uh
[1:01:36] this is what i wanted to to get to
[1:01:41] this just the display now it shows
[1:01:44] what's being done like god
[1:01:48] becoming god when
[1:01:52] when he created angers
[1:01:55] he become a son when he created
[1:01:58] christ jesus he become a savior
[1:02:02] when jesus died he become a healer
[1:02:06] when he was wounded for our
[1:02:07] transgression and with his tribes we
[1:02:09] are healed praise the lord
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:34] crisis identify the same 1964
[1:02:48] see me kind of for being a bit slow
[1:02:50] tonight i'm
[1:02:51] i'm kind of missing my mind taught in
[1:02:54] something here so but
[1:02:55] that's okay this is what i want to share
[1:02:58] with you tonight
[1:02:59] christ is identifying the same 1964 and
[1:03:02] then
[1:03:03] he is in tanner and in him was
[1:03:07] attributes
[1:03:09] and he spoke it and it
[1:03:12] was a word and
[1:03:16] the word may manifest
[1:03:19] and as the word was manifest
[1:03:22] is god becoming
[1:03:25] material now you just think about that
[1:03:30] god becoming that is the thought that is
[1:03:33] on my mind
[1:03:34] to think of god becoming
[1:03:39] just the thought to know that is god he
[1:03:42] says
[1:03:42] god becoming tangible god becoming
[1:03:46] material now we think of
[1:03:50] him being a creator
[1:03:54] but revelation says the beginning of the
[1:03:57] creation of god
[1:03:58] so god himself becomes his creation
[1:04:03] so it's not him creating something it's
[1:04:06] not
[1:04:06] like a capital making a cheer he goes
[1:04:09] and cut a wood
[1:04:11] and make a cheer no is god becoming
[1:04:16] his creation
[1:04:19] that's the reason why everything that he
[1:04:22] created he's represented in it
[1:04:26] that is the greatness of the godhead
[1:04:31] god becoming
[1:04:34] praise the lord it was not that god
[1:04:38] wanted to have a family god was becoming
[1:04:41] a family
[1:04:45] it's not that he want to have a family
[1:04:47] it's not that god wants to have a bride
[1:04:49] god is becoming his bride
[1:04:57] he's becoming
[1:05:01] and you and myself we the bride of jesus
[1:05:04] christ
[1:05:05] in this age
[1:05:09] the bride of jesus christ in this age
[1:05:14] we are at that father in
[1:05:18] of the of of pouring out that last
[1:05:21] material
[1:05:22] in god
[1:05:28] are we together
[1:05:31] praise the lord just like i said last
[1:05:35] last wednesday i mean i'm trying to
[1:05:38] bring this stuff so
[1:05:39] so we can we can be able to to see it
[1:05:42] and understand because
[1:05:43] those are the things that give us
[1:05:45] strength that give us
[1:05:46] overcoming power
[1:05:50] it's now we forcing ourself
[1:05:55] it's god pulling you redeeming you out
[1:05:58] of the world because
[1:05:59] he has choosing you as a vessel to
[1:06:01] become
[1:06:03] he want to become a son of god he want
[1:06:06] to become a daughter of god
[1:06:07] he want to be a young man in this age
[1:06:11] that is standing for truth that would
[1:06:13] not now will not blame
[1:06:14] into the culture he want to be a young
[1:06:16] woman
[1:06:20] that is the reality it's not god
[1:06:24] saving you because you are a sinner
[1:06:27] praise the lord amen
[1:06:31] all things were made by him and for him
[1:06:37] and for him a savior
[1:06:40] was for him because in him he had an
[1:06:44] attribute a savior is not for you
[1:06:52] that's the reason why if i mean if you
[1:06:54] if you
[1:06:55] if you if you downplay the savior god
[1:06:57] does not feedback
[1:07:02] worshiping god is not is i mean
[1:07:06] you're not doing god a favor
[1:07:13] are we together god
[1:07:17] becoming
[1:07:21] he becoming material
[1:07:28] that's the reason why he can identify
[1:07:30] himself as the son of righteousness
[1:07:32] he can identify himself as the tree of
[1:07:35] life
[1:07:36] he can identify himself as the river
[1:07:40] of living waters amen
[1:07:45] the river of living waters
[1:07:49] identified himself as a great eagle
[1:07:56] the bible says he came down his spirit
[1:08:00] in the form of a dove
[1:08:04] humble himself assalam god
[1:08:08] becoming
[1:08:13] praise the lord god becoming
[1:08:17] think about it this way that night
[1:08:21] when joseph took mary down to bethlehem
[1:08:24] and they were looking for a room
[1:08:29] they were looking for a room for god
[1:08:32] to be birthed think about it if the
[1:08:34] people
[1:08:35] knew if they knew that that was god
[1:08:40] that was going to become a baby they
[1:08:42] would have given the best they would
[1:08:44] have given their room it would have been
[1:08:45] them it would have been a clash
[1:08:48] no just in my room having a king bed
[1:08:51] i just bought my bed yesterday
[1:08:55] but they didn't know that god was
[1:08:56] becoming the baby
[1:08:59] there was no room
[1:09:03] praise the lord and here is in this very
[1:09:06] age
[1:09:07] god has come in the form of his word
[1:09:10] to find a people
[1:09:14] that he can become and you and myself
[1:09:16] have this privilege
[1:09:18] and you want to play with it and just
[1:09:21] play church
[1:09:26] and just play church that is the thing
[1:09:30] that will humble us that we humble
[1:09:34] us that god will look at all the
[1:09:37] the the the the wealthy people and all
[1:09:40] the
[1:09:40] the i mean wonderful people
[1:09:44] people whose whose parents i mean they
[1:09:46] just had a good life
[1:09:50] children that were born in holy warlord
[1:09:52] and all of that god will look at all of
[1:09:54] those wonderful people but he will come
[1:09:56] down
[1:09:56] and take you and myself
[1:10:02] that when we look down in our family
[1:10:04] history
[1:10:06] sometimes
[1:10:09] we feel ashamed of ourself god will
[1:10:12] choose
[1:10:13] you he will favor you
[1:10:17] to become
[1:10:22] and then you want to play church
[1:10:26] we want to we want to walk over
[1:10:30] the thing that the prophets of all
[1:10:35] saw invasion
[1:10:40] prophesied about
[1:10:45] jesus even told his disciples they were
[1:10:47] longing that it happened in their days
[1:10:50] but it didn't happen god
[1:10:53] be coming
[1:10:56] praise the lord god be coming
[1:11:04] god want to take your marriage
[1:11:07] christ and his church he wants to
[1:11:09] materialize himself
[1:11:12] in your home in your union
[1:11:17] when when when the minister married a
[1:11:20] man and his wife
[1:11:22] he says the two shall become one
[1:11:27] amen that's the oneness
[1:11:31] it does not make them one finger
[1:11:37] but they are one
[1:11:42] because there's a there's a there's
[1:11:44] there's a mystery that is going to be
[1:11:46] taking place in that union
[1:11:48] they are going to be learning
[1:11:52] they are going to be learning to serve
[1:11:54] god as they save
[1:11:55] one another that's what brother branham
[1:11:58] said
[1:12:00] if you serve your husband you are
[1:12:01] serving god that's what he said
[1:12:04] and i only said your husband if you save
[1:12:06] your wife you are serving god
[1:12:15] god materializing himself
[1:12:21] god be coming oh i just couldn't get
[1:12:24] away from that thought tonight it just
[1:12:26] for my mind
[1:12:27] i just couldn't get away from that oh my
[1:12:30] goodness
[1:12:32] god be coming to think about it
[1:12:36] that god
[1:12:40] the self-existing god
[1:12:46] the great internal spirit at one time
[1:12:50] he failed all time he filled all space
[1:12:54] there was nothing but
[1:12:57] elohim there was
[1:13:00] nothing but elohim
[1:13:04] and then elohim starts to become
[1:13:07] material
[1:13:09] the spirit starts to become material
[1:13:13] and we are the final product
[1:13:18] the bride is the final product
[1:13:25] praise the lord amen
[1:13:29] we are the father brother paul says we
[1:13:32] are his workmanship
[1:13:35] that's right amen we are his workmanship
[1:13:39] he takes the material of himself and
[1:13:42] he's working on it
[1:13:46] he's now working on it to to you know to
[1:13:49] bring something else he's working on it
[1:13:51] to bring
[1:13:51] himself
[1:13:58] oh my goodness me
[1:14:01] my goodness me god be coming
[1:14:05] my my my my mind
[1:14:09] praise the lord amen something brother
[1:14:12] branham said here
[1:14:14] and uh
[1:14:19] it's kind of a loss to thought here
[1:14:21] somewhere
[1:14:23] but i will be able to get it praise the
[1:14:25] lord
[1:14:27] i'll be able to get it oh
[1:14:30] my goodness my
[1:14:33] my my mind
[1:14:36] super sign he says and another thing
[1:14:40] the word was made dust
[1:14:44] flesh god became dust
[1:14:51] and brown said it when he went to visit
[1:14:53] abraham where he said he pick up the
[1:14:54] dust
[1:14:57] pick up the dust and he picked it and he
[1:15:00] stepped in it
[1:15:03] god materializing hallelujah
[1:15:08] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:15:11] when we died and rot in the earth
[1:15:13] quickening power is in the earth
[1:15:17] is god becoming dust and god will come
[1:15:19] back from the dust
[1:15:22] back to flesh god becoming
[1:15:28] you see that's the reason why god hate a
[1:15:30] proud spirit
[1:15:32] god hit arrogance
[1:15:38] because he can break himself in his
[1:15:41] greatness
[1:15:42] he can break himself
[1:15:45] he can break himself and reduce himself
[1:15:48] to dust
[1:15:49] all he asks of you is humble yourself
[1:15:53] now he asks of you but him almighty god
[1:15:56] he can break himself
[1:16:08] i hope the holy spirit when he wake up
[1:16:09] to you in in the middle of the night you
[1:16:11] will just hear that voice
[1:16:12] god be coming
[1:16:16] when you stand before the mirror to
[1:16:18] brush your teeth god be coming
[1:16:25] that's that's what he's been doing
[1:16:28] throughout
[1:16:28] all the ages that's what he's doing
[1:16:41] he made everything for his pleasure
[1:16:53] god was missed god's flesh due to manas
[1:16:58] jehovah the word became human
[1:17:02] became dust oh my
[1:17:10] god you love the lord tonight
[1:17:18] god becoming my my my mind
[1:17:25] praise the lord oh
[1:17:29] my yeah there's there's there's
[1:17:32] something that brother brandon plays
[1:17:34] in this talking and uh i can see
[1:17:37] i think maybe i added it to the to my
[1:17:40] notes i wanted to use tonight so
[1:17:42] i just got got in and throw this one
[1:17:45] there over to
[1:17:49] super sign he said god in flesh oh it
[1:17:52] will be struck into the word
[1:17:54] jehovah god becoming one of us
[1:17:58] changing his cast from the great
[1:18:02] immortal jehovah to become
[1:18:05] a little infant baby
[1:18:09] that's the thing that blows the mind of
[1:18:11] the people
[1:18:16] that's the thing that blows the mind of
[1:18:18] the people
[1:18:21] the reason why other religions struggle
[1:18:24] over jesus
[1:18:25] being the son of god is because when
[1:18:28] they think about son
[1:18:29] all that comes to their mind is just
[1:18:31] filthiness
[1:18:34] that's what they think about son i was
[1:18:37] talking with a muslim before
[1:18:39] and i was and and we were talking on
[1:18:41] that subject
[1:18:42] he says well god is not a man to have a
[1:18:44] son i says well that's not what the
[1:18:46] bible says
[1:18:48] it was something that god brought out of
[1:18:52] himself
[1:18:54] and the moment you see that
[1:18:57] it makes more sense
[1:19:09] but my emphasis tonight is right on this
[1:19:13] thought
[1:19:16] jesus said at that day
[1:19:20] you will know that i'm in the father
[1:19:25] the father in me i in you and you in me
[1:19:28] how can you
[1:19:29] how can you how can you break that down
[1:19:35] praise the lord how can you break that
[1:19:40] into three how can you
[1:19:46] how can you separate it it's such a mix
[1:19:50] and that's the reason why in revelation
[1:19:52] chapter 3
[1:19:55] instead of saying i in you and you in me
[1:19:57] he said i will stop with you
[1:20:00] and you will suff with me
[1:20:05] amen in one sense i will be feeding off
[1:20:08] your life
[1:20:10] just as you are feeding of the word of
[1:20:12] god
[1:20:15] god is feeding off our life that's what
[1:20:17] brother branham says
[1:20:18] he said we we will be bred on the
[1:20:20] master's table
[1:20:26] he's getting our life backing us by the
[1:20:28] word of god
[1:20:30] so we can be bred on the master's table
[1:20:33] as we are feeding on the word
[1:20:35] god want to be feeding off your life
[1:20:41] that's the son of god that's that's my
[1:20:43] son
[1:20:44] that's my daughter feeding off of us
[1:20:48] i will sup with you and you with me
[1:20:55] and all of this is what god is doing in
[1:20:58] our age
[1:20:59] that this is the reason why he sent a
[1:21:01] prophet
[1:21:02] this is the reason why he sent a son of
[1:21:05] man ministry
[1:21:06] is not to make doctrines and and and
[1:21:08] fight with this cult and that cult
[1:21:10] is god materializing himself in a people
[1:21:17] we can take our hurts and our
[1:21:19] differences
[1:21:20] to the word of god and we know
[1:21:23] that it's god materializing
[1:21:26] materializing himself in us
[1:21:28] putting us on the wheel and breaking us
[1:21:30] down and spinning our life
[1:21:32] just like the goldsmith will we'll put
[1:21:35] the gold in the fire
[1:21:36] he will put us through trials
[1:21:39] because it's god becoming
[1:21:43] is god becoming
[1:21:48] is god becoming
[1:21:53] amen god becoming
[1:21:59] god will be coming sister be real god
[1:22:01] will be coming
[1:22:03] but won't god be coming better scared
[1:22:05] god becoming
[1:22:10] that's why he told david i'll give you a
[1:22:11] name
[1:22:14] he says i will give you a name you know
[1:22:17] what what he did
[1:22:18] he never changed the name that david
[1:22:20] parents gave him
[1:22:21] but he came behind that name
[1:22:25] he came behind the name that david
[1:22:27] father gave him he didn't say i gave you
[1:22:28] a name and said david not your name no
[1:22:30] more david
[1:22:33] he says i will give you a name and he
[1:22:34] comes behind that name
[1:22:36] god be coming he comes behind the name
[1:22:38] that your parents gave you
[1:22:45] he comes behind that name oh my goodness
[1:22:49] maybe sonny if the lord help us we talk
[1:22:50] on nim being a choice
[1:22:57] god becoming tangible
[1:23:01] god becoming flesh
[1:23:07] praise the lord
[1:23:10] just like i said from the womb to the
[1:23:12] grave
[1:23:14] no excuse no excuse from the womb to the
[1:23:19] grave god became
[1:23:20] a baby in the womb
[1:23:27] my parents says oh my child smile they
[1:23:29] don't know what they are doing they are
[1:23:30] small
[1:23:32] god became a baby in a womb
[1:23:36] he took samuel at at a young age
[1:23:39] maybe 88 from about three years old when
[1:23:42] the last starts to talk god starts to
[1:23:43] deal with him
[1:23:44] god was becoming the prophet
[1:23:56] make excuses and allow
[1:24:00] the devil because when you give the
[1:24:02] devil those excuses my child is
[1:24:03] just a small child and okay the devil
[1:24:06] said okay
[1:24:10] the bible says foolishness it's in the
[1:24:12] child
[1:24:15] until they are safe foolishness is in
[1:24:17] them
[1:24:18] i don't care whether they're born from
[1:24:20] the prophet or from the pastor or
[1:24:21] whoever bound them foolishness
[1:24:24] is birth
[1:24:28] and it takes the road of correction the
[1:24:30] word of god
[1:24:31] to beat that foolishness out
[1:24:36] because god is becoming
[1:24:49] praise the lord
[1:24:53] we can go ahead and
[1:24:56] just go and and going
[1:25:00] oh my goodness me automatic goal itself
[1:25:06] amen automatic goal itself you read
[1:25:09] some of these things they just they just
[1:25:12] they just
[1:25:12] humble you they just humble you
[1:25:17] they just humble you because because you
[1:25:20] you you don't want it to just
[1:25:22] it for it to just remain ahead knowledge
[1:25:26] like paul says i don't want to preach
[1:25:28] and be cast away
[1:25:31] i want this word to be flesh me
[1:25:35] i want the word to become me
[1:25:38] not just to preach oh that was a great
[1:25:41] great cemetery it's not
[1:25:42] we have passed the days of great salmon
[1:25:46] we are in the days where brother branham
[1:25:48] said leave me as simon
[1:25:51] because god want to become the word on
[1:25:54] two feet
[1:25:57] leave me a song then sing me a special
[1:26:00] yes father thank you
[1:26:06] god becoming

[1:26:28] i want to put up our wings and start
[1:26:30] flying
[1:26:31] god be coming from the womb to the grave
[1:26:34] no excuse
[1:26:52] it's almost nine o'clock musicians you
[1:26:55] can come for tonight
[1:26:58] sunday after the service i like to talk
[1:27:00] to the young people
[1:27:08] so we stay a little bit after the
[1:27:11] service
[1:27:14] i'm telling you church if we miss this
[1:27:16] we miss the whole purpose while
[1:27:18] we are here we miss the whole purpose
[1:27:23] you know what i was going to talk about
[1:27:24] tonight that was that was haunting my
[1:27:27] mind
[1:27:28] let me share a little bit of that with
[1:27:30] you i was i was thinking about it we
[1:27:32] talked about the sleeping virgin
[1:27:36] you know the bible actually said even
[1:27:39] the wise virgin was sleeping
[1:27:43] amen it's not because the foolish was
[1:27:46] sleeping that's what make them foolish
[1:27:48] will actually make them foolish because
[1:27:50] they were sleeping without oil
[1:27:53] but even the wise one that had oil was
[1:27:55] sleeping
[1:27:57] and that's what is happening people have
[1:27:59] got experience with god
[1:28:03] and they think well i i got the baptism
[1:28:05] of the holy ghost i
[1:28:06] thank god i've i've got my i'm married
[1:28:08] now no temptation for me thank god
[1:28:10] and they are sleeping with their
[1:28:12] experiences
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:20] they just packed we just packed that our
[1:28:22] experience on
[1:28:23] our arm i've been saved i've been born
[1:28:26] again is truth
[1:28:36] that's what i was thinking about all
[1:28:38] through the week
[1:28:44] as i re rebuild those shepherds rebuke
[1:28:46] those wise men
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:28:49] it says watch men sleeping
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:54] awake
[1:29:02] that's that's that's some of the things
[1:29:04] that is happening
[1:29:23] but god becoming a bride
[1:29:29] it's christ in bryophone god is becoming
[1:29:33] this bride
[1:29:34] that is the reason why he will
[1:29:38] get a bride he will get a bride
[1:29:44] because he's not just a stranger to him
[1:29:46] he's the one becoming the bride
[1:29:50] he's becoming his bride the bride and
[1:29:53] christ will be exactly the same
[1:29:56] because it was god that became christ
[1:29:59] and
[1:29:59] god is becoming his bride he's becoming
[1:30:03] the last days church
[1:30:07] is getting the people that will be
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:18] victorious
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:23] we're not going to give no room to the
[1:30:24] devil we're not going to make excuses
[1:30:27] [Music]
[1:30:30] we're not going to make excuses people
[1:30:32] getting discouraged
[1:30:34] and people finding they're trying to
[1:30:36] find a door out of the ark
[1:30:39] we know that god make his word he saw by
[1:30:42] himself
[1:30:44] god is not depending on human effort
[1:30:49] no
[1:30:53] it's god that is becoming
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:57] and that is the thing that i want us to
[1:31:00] appreciate
[1:31:03] that's what i want us to appreciate
[1:31:06] because you have to remember brother
[1:31:07] branham said if you put yourself into
[1:31:09] the plan of god you will mess it up
[1:31:11] it is not you it's he's the one
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:31] let's just worship him tonight
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:57] beautiful ambulance
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:06] i'm longing for you

[1:33:20] oh
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:35] let me tell you something i just
[1:33:37] listened to a quote today from brother
[1:33:39] brannon
[1:33:41] brother branham said god made the garden
[1:33:42] of eden
[1:33:44] because his lies this church would be a
[1:33:46] type of the garden of eden
[1:33:49] so the garden of eden actually was god
[1:33:51] becoming a garden
[1:33:52] and that's the reason why god was so
[1:33:54] angry with ahab
[1:33:56] when he talked nova banya because god
[1:33:59] has always
[1:34:00] lacking himself onto a vein here he has
[1:34:03] always lacking himself onto agave
[1:34:06] because that's what he's making his
[1:34:07] people
[1:34:09] he was walking in the midst of the seven
[1:34:11] goalie candlestick the same voice that
[1:34:13] was walking in the garden
[1:34:15] is the same voice that is walking in the
[1:34:17] seven golden candlestick
[1:34:18] he's walking in our midst just like he
[1:34:21] was walking in a garden of eden
[1:34:26] is god becoming he's becoming a family
[1:34:31] god becoming a husband god becoming a
[1:34:34] [Music]
