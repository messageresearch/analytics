[37:47] that is just speaking to us in different
[37:49] ways and I was thinking about it this is
[37:51] the first Sunday of the Monday actually
[37:53] should be our communion
[37:54] service and and the first communion
[37:58] service I was ever here the Passover was
[38:01] right in the time of a plague
[38:03] praise the Lord it was right in the time
[38:07] of a national player God was dealing
[38:10] with with Egypt you know honor the
[38:12] Ministry of Moses and and that was the
[38:15] way he assured his people you know out
[38:19] of Egypt you know was I was bad a
[38:22] convenient the beginning of months and
[38:25] and I mean in in all of those things you
[38:28] know but where my mind was going with
[38:31] with that you know I was thinking about
[38:33] it I was saying I was saying man we
[38:36] don't we don't know how long this thing
[38:38] is going to linger and if we don't we
[38:40] don't be careful you know they might rob
[38:43] us of some of our our you know our
[38:45] spiritual blessings and so I started
[38:50] thinking about it and and started
[38:52] checking you know and I said well I'll
[38:54] get online and see if I can find now you
[39:00] know this communion tray with a little
[39:03] cups number Johnny just just kind of for
[39:06] turn the light on in my head because I
[39:08] was finding all of those trade but once
[39:10] I was finding the Naha cops actually you
[39:13] can buy the disposable cops you know and
[39:16] after people use it and throw it away so
[39:17] I couldn't buy any SS all of these ones
[39:19] does not have cuffs talking about a tray
[39:21] with our cups and any my search and then
[39:26] I found this possible one you know that
[39:30] I can slip right in my bag and get on
[39:33] the road praise the Lord
[39:38] the scripture says they went from house
[39:41] to house breaking bread amen praise the
[39:44] Lord so we will not allow this
[39:48] Kover 19 or whatever area is to stop us
[39:52] from enjoying the blessing of God we are
[39:54] ready for this devil more than ever
[39:56] before
[39:56] amen he cannot stop us praise the Lord
[40:00] amen
[40:02] you know so but I was thinking you know
[40:06] if if the Lord break us out of this you
[40:09] know what are we going to stay in along
[40:11] what are we going to come out of faith
[40:13] is not going to change our love for God
[40:16] it's not going to change our service for
[40:18] God it's not going to change our
[40:20] devotion for God praise the Lord we will
[40:22] keep the Word of God in season and out
[40:25] of season and so you know but we would
[40:30] get you will get that entire tray set
[40:32] and as soon as the Lord can lift this
[40:36] curse from upon us that is the way we
[40:40] approach our our communion service you
[40:43] know for now you know because I mean I
[40:46] don't want I don't want any you know any
[40:49] doubt lingering around the service you
[40:53] know whatever people might be thinking
[40:55] you know the Lord has blessed us for
[40:58] many years we have did our communion
[41:00] from the same glass and and he has just
[41:04] been blessing you we have to remember
[41:06] the last communion service we wear from
[41:08] bourbon bourbon MCs the communion is
[41:10] divine healing you know and and divine
[41:13] healing must remain in the church you
[41:15] know the churches that have a stain from
[41:18] communion and all of their they are
[41:19] denying the people of experiencing
[41:21] divine healing because there is healing
[41:23] in the water there is healing in the
[41:25] wine the bread represent the body you
[41:28] know that was broken for us now so when
[41:32] we get back the Lord help us we'll get
[41:34] one of those tray that's how we would go
[41:35] with our convenient until he can be able
[41:37] to raise our faith again amen praise the
[41:41] Lord but until then you know as we go
[41:44] into this week
[41:45] this is Palm Sunday this coming Friday
[41:48] it is going to be Good Friday next
[41:51] Sunday is going to be Easter Sunday
[41:53] let's just keep this time before the
[41:55] Lord amen let's let's keep our hearts in
[41:58] praying for one another I mean less less
[42:01] let's go let's go
[42:02] - cavalrymen let's go down the streets
[42:05] of jerusalem this week let's go to
[42:07] Palace Josh main hall and see how Jesus
[42:10] - alone let's go in the night and see
[42:13] how Peter denied him praise the Lord it
[42:15] might not be Peter they might be you it
[42:17] might be mean because all the disciples
[42:19] deny him he was left alone
[42:21] so let's trouble with him this week
[42:23] let's keep it in our mind let's make
[42:25] that I mean that is the only religious
[42:28] even that we had only religious holiday
[42:32] we have is the Easter that is the thing
[42:35] of what our faith is all about that is
[42:38] what Christianity is all about is the
[42:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ so let's
[42:42] just keep it real this this week we
[42:45] might not be together but I mean we will
[42:50] be in in the last day that's what I'll
[42:54] talk about that a little bit you know
[42:56] over in Revelation chapter 1 verse 10
[42:59] the Bible says and John was in a spirit
[43:02] in the last day and brother branham
[43:04] Torah it was it was a bit different from
[43:06] the days of the day of the law because
[43:08] the day of the Lord all through the
[43:10] scripture was pointing to the judgment
[43:13] of God but what John was was going
[43:17] through being transported in a spirit he
[43:20] was in the last day and I was looking at
[43:22] that last night how beautiful it is I
[43:24] really read something to you here from
[43:26] brother Branham but you see the bride
[43:27] God's people that are honored talking
[43:30] that is experiencing the baptism of the
[43:33] Holy Ghost in their soul is actually in
[43:36] the last day because he's dealing with
[43:38] us I mean he's speaking to us he's we
[43:40] are traveling with him why the word
[43:43] because a judgment that all through the
[43:47] scripture the Prophet spoke about God
[43:49] judgment as the day of the Lord so the
[43:53] word is is experiencing the dead of the
[43:56] Lord I mean the fullness of it I have
[43:57] not break upon the word yet but they are
[44:00] experiencing the dead of the Lord
[44:01] why the bride is caught up in the law
[44:04] state it means we are currently in a
[44:07] revelation of his world we are caught up
[44:09] in what he's doing in our life and and
[44:12] and where he's taking us to so and and
[44:15] those things have
[44:16] be real praise the Lord I believe that's
[44:19] a reason why God having us to go through
[44:21] this thing with the word he want him
[44:23] make himself more real to us than we
[44:26] have ever experienced him amen praise
[44:29] the Lord so we want to thank the Lord
[44:31] this morning and and just as I was
[44:33] saying you know I have my man anointing
[44:37] all year I have my convenient trade it
[44:40] was so beautiful so this thing and it's
[44:45] right Genesis do this in remembrance of
[44:48] me oh my goodness
[44:51] praise the Lord you know so just like I
[44:56] said I don't know how how long this is
[44:58] going to go but you know if the Lord
[45:02] blessed us and as we go along
[45:04] and any of you things you know praying
[45:09] and feeding your heart you want to have
[45:11] communion we will not do it every day in
[45:13] your house to you alone I mean once a
[45:16] month will be a bit okay but if you feel
[45:20] the need of faith you just let us know
[45:22] we were prayed in and then we we can
[45:25] come right to your house and self
[45:27] communion amen if you want to stay in
[45:29] the living room and keep me in the
[45:31] kitchen we'll come right to your house
[45:32] and have communion together
[45:34] [Laughter]
[45:36] praise the Lord Amen but I'm telling you
[45:40] we're ready for this devil a me praise
[45:43] the Lord Amen we are ready for this
[45:47] devil he's just taking us back to the
[45:49] book of Acts amen keeping us in our home
[45:52] to have service it's not new to the
[45:54] church we must not be an embarrassing
[45:56] man because that's what the Old
[45:58] Testament says they from house to house
[46:00] the wind breaking bread praise the Lord
[46:02] and I would just encourage you the law
[46:04] place on your heart this week you know
[46:06] just just building prayer you know if he
[46:10] placed on your heart to spend a time
[46:11] before him spend that time before him
[46:14] you know I pray for me and I'll be
[46:16] praying for you but you know let's let's
[46:18] make this Easter Special
[46:20] amen let's make this Easter special we
[46:23] we I mean we plan to have a Easter
[46:26] meeting in
[46:27] and we can still have an Easter meeting
[46:30] and then you can we can have an Easter
[46:32] meeting with the Lord it can be you and
[46:34] the Lord on your knees
[46:35] have an Easter meeting experience the
[46:38] power of the Resurrection I don't know
[46:40] if for some reason that is just the
[46:43] burden that is on my heart birds cat I
[46:44] mean making emphasis on the Holy Ghost
[46:48] has never struck my heart like the way
[46:50] I'm feeling about it
[46:51] praise the Lord I mean that's the ticket
[46:54] we have to get out of this he meant that
[46:57] is our assurance that we would get
[46:59] through this praise the Lord the Holy
[47:01] Ghost is the only thing that we need you
[47:03] see that's the reason why Wednesday
[47:04] night I was talking about all of this
[47:06] jewelry out there and people trying to
[47:08] talk about Vaseline what a vice in or
[47:10] Navesink that's what I'm gonna get into
[47:12] this morning God Holy Ghost is our
[47:15] inoculation
[47:16] he has already I give us our vast in
[47:20] fascination with his spirit and and and
[47:24] and I was just thinking about this the
[47:26] other day Isis oh my goodness this whole
[47:28] world I mean the minds of the people so
[47:31] scary I mean all the preachers are
[47:32] talking about it all I mean all the
[47:35] megachurch preachers they are talking
[47:37] about it and what they put in the mind
[47:39] of the people is this won't work
[47:41] government and everybody is going to be
[47:43] having a digital number and everybody is
[47:46] going to be having a special number you
[47:48] know and I'm going to bring this
[47:50] fascination and it will fasten you and
[47:52] and all of that look Paul the Apostle
[47:56] Paul when he received the Holy Ghost you
[47:59] think about it he had an experience of
[48:02] one of the more daily snake to bite him
[48:05] and brother branham said because he had
[48:07] a quick empowering him he has already
[48:10] received God's fascination that the
[48:14] other person of national could not kill
[48:16] him praise the Lord
[48:19] so you see when we have the Holy Ghost
[48:22] that's the reason why he gave us the
[48:24] promise we would drink the other things
[48:26] it will not harm us is not that we will
[48:28] look at it and drink it but if we are
[48:30] not conscious of it and we drink it
[48:32] because he he has possessed this body
[48:34] and he is dwelling in this body is not
[48:36] going to go any far
[48:41] praise the Lord so I mean the Holy Ghost
[48:47] is our only way out of this praise the
[48:50] Lord
[48:50] and this morning I want to speak on a
[48:54] message you know Jesus Christ described
[48:58] his age as children playing in the
[49:01] marketplace
[49:02] Berta Branham described our age as a
[49:05] little ball going through the grave yeah
[49:08] whistling aiming so that's what I want
[49:12] to speak about I was thinking about this
[49:14] all through the week then and then I
[49:16] started checking checking online and
[49:19] trying to look for the kind of an image
[49:21] I could use and then a low key later a
[49:24] good Christian and a Christian Avenger
[49:29] you know program for kids we had a
[49:32] little picture there show a little ball
[49:35] going through the graveyard whistling oh
[49:38] man I was here yesterday that I was just
[49:41] having the time with the Lord

[49:46] Andrews I see brother Andrews you copied
[49:48] this picture for me I want to use it

[50:46] far from your frame house but there is a
[50:52] shot card
[50:53] you can take but it's true the grave
[50:56] yeah as you walk through the spooky dyin
[51:03] gates of the cemetery and make your way
[51:07] by the many tombstones you start to feed
[51:12] neighbors you have taken this shock of
[51:17] many times during the day but things
[51:20] just feel different at night you wish
[51:24] you had a friend with you
[51:29] so to occupy your mind you start
[51:31] whistling why you quickly walk towards
[51:35] the other side about halfway across you
[51:40] see a shadow of a tree moving and the
[51:44] wane and you hear that the rustles of
[51:49] the love of it leaves is enough to get
[51:52] you running as fast as you can with
[51:57] great relief you finally leave the grave
[52:01] year behind and so on arrived home amen

[54:02] season time and cz must be something we
[54:05] are experiencing in our body of what God
[54:07] is doing for yourself
[54:10] nope FLE that the day of the Lord so
[54:15] cometh as a thief in the night for
[54:20] wendish I say peace and safety then
[54:24] suddenly destruction cometh that's the
[54:28] only scripture that could kind of a
[54:30] describe walking in the gravy away sling
[54:33] [Laughter]
[54:35] for when they shall say peace and safety
[54:38] then suddenly destruction cometh upon
[54:40] them as travail upon a woman with child

[54:53] brethren are not in darkness that the
[54:58] day should overtake you as a thief ye

[57:35] pray amen amen Allah bless you
[57:39] you can have your sea praise of Lord
[57:42] amen but Pascal mentioned but one not
[57:49] being feeling well and we were able to
[57:53] talk to him in and have some fellowship
[57:55] with him as perscare see he's doing well
[57:57] and guess what I was with brother
[57:59] brother Brad yesterday and and we just
[58:03] and we just had it we just had a time
[58:05] amen I mean the Lord being kind of a
[58:08] with him in I mean in in his own way and
[58:13] I mean we were down in his garage his
[58:17] workplace he was you know helping me
[58:19] doing some work there and he was
[58:21] testifying to me and I mean social
[58:23] presence came in the garage and he's
[58:24] crying and I'm looking in his face
[58:29] I mean we can have Church and a word in
[58:32] every word Amen praise the Lord I mean
[58:36] we just we just had a good time
[58:38] yesterday I mean crying laughing and and
[58:42] just and just shouting shouting all over
[58:45] the place we were just like children
[58:47] playing in the mechanic all yesterday oh
[58:50] [Laughter]
[58:52] praise the Lord amen so I talked a
[58:56] little bit yeah but Brennan I mean for
[58:58] years speaking and saying they're the
[59:01] dead of the law coming as a thief in the
[59:03] night wish of course we know that
[59:06] birdbrain Chase is the date of judgment
[59:08] now let's see what were banished a year
[59:11] over in Patmos vision revelation chapter
[59:16] 110 he says actually what what happened
[59:21] was that John was caught up in the
[59:25] spirit now watched our work cut up is
[59:28] the same as raptured
[59:29] I mean is the same as being in heavenly
[59:33] places so John was caught up in the
[59:36] spirit and transported into the last day
[59:40] which is yet to come
[59:42] the Bible speaks of the day of the Lord
[59:46] which is to be in the future and John is
[59:51] now seeing the things of their future
[59:55] but in the meantime just to settle our
[1:00:00] minds amen he says it is it is just that
[1:00:07] at this time of the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ
[1:00:12] John was taking up the same as caught up
[1:00:15] taking up the same word come up higher
[1:00:19] rapture is all the same word for
[1:00:22] alone John was taken up by the spirit
[1:00:26] and bourbon and made emphasis on that
[1:00:29] you know John was in the spirit on the
[1:00:32] last day that was word he was talking
[1:00:34] about being in a spirit of laude shirt
[1:00:37] and being in a spirit you know that's
[1:00:40] what he was talking because it is irani
[1:00:42] parallel if we don't if we don't take
[1:00:45] time we would think that is the same
[1:00:47] just like the date of the Lord I was
[1:00:49] looking at a lot of commentary last
[1:00:51] night and I was understanding why
[1:00:53] brother Branham was saying he says many
[1:00:55] things that I did of the Lord is Sunday
[1:00:58] you know because it's a complete
[1:01:01] different way that John expresses it
[1:01:03] nowhere in the scripture it is written
[1:01:06] that day that the lost day you will see
[1:01:10] all through the scripture the dead of
[1:01:11] the law the dead of the law the dead of
[1:01:13] the Lord is only in Revelation 1:10 that
[1:01:16] the Bible turn the world that way that
[1:01:20] the Lost Dane and brother Branham says
[1:01:22] many of the commutator wish of course
[1:01:24] when you look there some would say is is
[1:01:26] is is the last day the first day of the
[1:01:31] week because it used to be the Sabbath
[1:01:34] day but because of the resurrection the
[1:01:38] early church make it the first day of
[1:01:40] the week so many believed that it was
[1:01:43] the lost a brother Branham was trying to
[1:01:45] help us to realize that it's not a
[1:01:48] passive day like some day but it's an
[1:01:51] experience that goes with the believer
[1:01:54] because every day to the believer is the
[1:01:56] last day every day in the heart of the
[1:01:59] believer is the last day are we together
[1:02:02] so the believer experienced the last day
[1:02:06] while the war goes through the day of
[1:02:09] the Lord that is the difference are we
[1:02:12] together
[1:02:14] Amen man I I don't know what is
[1:02:18] happening but it's like there's an
[1:02:19] atmosphere in this building this morning
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:26] John was taking about the spirit and
[1:02:29] transported by the spirit to that great
[1:02:33] day that is coming the lost ape is when
[1:02:36] the days of man is over
[1:02:40] when the work of flesh is over it's when
[1:02:44] we are now submitting ourself toward the
[1:02:48] Word of God submitting ourselves to the
[1:02:50] Spirit of God not being led by our own
[1:02:53] ideas and our own desire that's man's
[1:02:56] day he goes alone he says a little bit
[1:02:59] then the kingdom of this world will
[1:03:02] become the kingdoms of our God praise
[1:03:06] the Lord
[1:03:07] amen he says that's the lost day but the
[1:03:11] day of the Lord is when Josh man falls
[1:03:15] so the deal of the law speaks of
[1:03:18] judgment the last day speaks of our
[1:03:25] experience of God when we are lifted up
[1:03:30] above our fleshly desires when we are
[1:03:33] caught up into joy unspeakable for the
[1:03:35] glory when you just don't know what
[1:03:38] making you happy but you just happen oh
[1:03:40] you are in the Lord's Day it's not a
[1:03:43] date of flesh I mean when you I mean
[1:03:46] when when is you just thinking one hymns
[1:03:49] from another you just thinking I mean
[1:03:51] songs are just flowing through your mind
[1:03:53] it's just flowing through your heart you
[1:03:55] just feeling so happy that's the last
[1:04:00] day a me and after that comes the
[1:04:06] millennia so see what he says here the
[1:04:09] day of the Lord is when the judgment
[1:04:12] Falls that's for the world and then
[1:04:15] after there comes the millennium that is
[1:04:18] for the believer prays alone so that the
[1:04:22] dead of the Lord and the lost he goes I
[1:04:25] has to say he says right now the world
[1:04:28] does what I want to do with the
[1:04:31] Christians they call him all manner of
[1:04:34] evil names make fun of him but
[1:04:36] there-there is coming
[1:04:39] that Great and notable day when there we
[1:04:42] will in Hall for the lamb is coming in
[1:04:46] RAF to Josh the word that is when the
[1:04:49] Rogers will have their day with the Lord
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:54] so the the Lord's Day is when the
[1:04:58] believer is having a beer with the Lord
[1:05:00] that the believer is having a time with
[1:05:03] the Lord the believer is spending time
[1:05:05] in God's presence walking by faith a man
[1:05:08] living in love
[1:05:10] amen praise the Lord this is when the
[1:05:18] righteous will have the idea with the
[1:05:19] Lord for the wicked shall burn and the
[1:05:24] righteous will walk over there atrás in
[1:05:27] the Millennium praise the Lord is just
[1:05:29] like right there in Egypt you know
[1:05:33] George man was falling and but the
[1:05:37] household of Israel was dead in Goshen
[1:05:40] with light you know I mean they were
[1:05:43] they were there singing the son of Moses
[1:05:45] they were dead I mean remembering the
[1:05:48] covenant of abraham and what george man
[1:05:50] is falling on the other side
[1:05:54] praise the Lord
[1:05:56] I mean and just like I said there was a
[1:06:02] time of the first communion it took
[1:06:05] place on a plague and they saw this
[1:06:08] convenient soon asked I mean this place
[1:06:09] should not stop us amen it should not
[1:06:13] stop us
[1:06:14] glory be to God amen so I'll just I just
[1:06:20] wanted to go go back to Dan and then
[1:06:23] I'll take a review back again from
[1:06:26] Wednesday night talking about the Mack
[1:06:28] of the beach let's read this code Brad
[1:06:30] Branham share the mark of the beast 1954
[1:06:33] he said now you see what the mark of the
[1:06:37] beast is is the mark of apostasy
[1:06:46] if a person who think it's a person whom
[1:06:52] just think they're well I belong to
[1:06:55] church and I'm just as good as the next
[1:07:00] fellow he says I belong to this church
[1:07:05] and you realize were your church
[1:07:10] organization that you are depending on
[1:07:14] where it comes from
[1:07:15] do you realize the Bible said that he
[1:07:21] the Bible said he that worship the Beast
[1:07:25] receive his Mack or the letter of his
[1:07:30] name
[1:07:30] now watch in the forehead or hand
[1:07:36] there's knowledge in the forehead
[1:07:40] knowledge in hand deeds where balances
[1:07:48] that's what it is in the forehead or in
[1:07:50] the hint that's knowledge or deeds
[1:07:54] praise the Lord
[1:07:56] so receiving the mic in the forehead is
[1:07:59] knowledge that's the reason why I was
[1:08:02] pointing out on Wednesday night a
[1:08:04] mindset the scripture said trust in the
[1:08:08] Lord with all your heart and lean not on
[1:08:12] to your own understanding laying that on
[1:08:15] to your own mindset because the human
[1:08:18] mind said is just stop honest when a man
[1:08:22] said in his own mind said he just become
[1:08:24] stubborn in listening to anybody so
[1:08:28] brother Branham says the mag is in your
[1:08:31] forehead or your hand that is knowledge
[1:08:34] or d-dad don't he says that don't means
[1:08:39] you got a big tattoo on your face it
[1:08:44] don't have to be dead it's not taking of
[1:08:49] an outward is is is talking it's not
[1:08:55] talking of the outward is talking of
[1:08:58] spiritual
[1:08:59] praise the Lord now something happened
[1:09:03] Wednesday night I was confused a little
[1:09:06] bit you remember when I was talking and
[1:09:09] I referred our brother branham since you
[1:09:12] know these two Mac was played out in
[1:09:14] Genesis and I took Genesis chapter 3 and
[1:09:18] the seed of the woman I got that taught
[1:09:23] on my way to church and I wrote it down
[1:09:26] in the office and I referred to as
[1:09:30] Wednesday night but I was I was a little
[1:09:34] bit stuck in between our in my mind I
[1:09:37] was thinking what wow what am I talking
[1:09:41] about Genesis chapter 3 verse 15 the
[1:09:44] seed of the woman were in here does it
[1:09:48] shows out the mark of the beast but I
[1:09:51] will tell you something the Lord spoke
[1:09:53] to me yesterday and he helped me to
[1:09:56] understand why he laid that scripture on
[1:09:58] my heart
[1:09:58] praise the Lord let's look here a little
[1:10:01] bit here in Genesis chapter 4 let's look
[1:10:04] at King yet a little bit as we look at
[1:10:07] this map we're just doing a review from
[1:10:09] Wednesday night and then we were getting
[1:10:11] to our message this morning praise the
[1:10:14] Lord Amen you that a home I don't I
[1:10:21] don't have to to tell you they're sorry
[1:10:23] for taking your time because you already
[1:10:25] home praise the Lord Amen I would just I
[1:10:33] just have to sew adjectives that I hear
[1:10:38] with me in this morning to to be patient
[1:10:40] a little bit with me amen
[1:10:42] praise the Lord let's look at Genesis
[1:10:44] chapter 4 Genesis chapter 4 brings out
[1:10:51] word Cain and Abel went out you know to
[1:10:57] make it sacrifice before the Lord and
[1:11:00] the scripture says here reading from
[1:11:03] verse 6 that's where the law started
[1:11:05] speaking to King that's father now and
[1:11:08] the law said and the lost speaking to
[1:11:12] King
[1:11:13] that wroth and why is thy countenance
[1:11:15] falling if they'll do well shall their
[1:11:22] net be accepted now Berta Branham says
[1:11:25] actually God was telling King go and do
[1:11:29] as your brother ever did amen if you can
[1:11:36] go and do what your brother ever did
[1:11:42] would that now be accepted and if doubt
[1:11:46] does now well sin lieth at the door and
[1:11:51] unto thee shall be his desire and - and
[1:11:57] thou shalt rule over him and king talked
[1:12:00] with Abel and it came to pass when they
[1:12:05] were in the field now we see God has
[1:12:07] already instructed King to go and do the
[1:12:12] right thing but he had a mindset because
[1:12:16] he was angry he got stuck in that
[1:12:19] mindset instead of taking the correction
[1:12:22] of God he used our mindset and when is
[1:12:25] slay his brother because in his mind
[1:12:28] said what he did was right
[1:12:32] nobody should correct him so he goes he
[1:12:37] got stuck in their mind said I'm going
[1:12:39] to do it no matter what you say so he
[1:12:43] went and he killed his brother are we
[1:12:48] together verse 9 and the Lord said unto
[1:12:53] King where is a better brother now see
[1:12:56] the attitude now God came down and
[1:12:58] corrected him he refused he killed his
[1:13:01] brother God come down again trying to
[1:13:03] draw him into fellowship trying to draw
[1:13:06] him into reconciliation where is your
[1:13:08] brother am I my brother's keeper he just
[1:13:11] fly a while because he stuck into a
[1:13:14] mindset and his mind said there is that
[1:13:18] I was right from the beginning my my
[1:13:22] sacrifice you have been accepted
[1:13:25] praise the Lord verbatim says is
[1:13:30] knowledge or deeds now so verse 11 and
[1:13:39] now that occurs from the earth because
[1:13:44] he would not listen to God amen
[1:13:48] we have opened her mouth to receive thy
[1:13:52] brother's blood from the hang-its what
[1:13:57] his hands have done is his deeds his
[1:14:03] mindset is affecting his work
[1:14:07] praise the Lord is his deeds the earth
[1:14:15] has opened his mouth received a
[1:14:17] brother's blood from thy hand when they
[1:14:22] out till at the ground hashanah hands
[1:14:25] for the year on today cause strength a
[1:14:29] fugitive in vagabond shalt thou be in
[1:14:34] the earth and King said unto the Lord my
[1:14:40] punishment is great then I can bear
[1:14:43] that's not repentance that statement is
[1:14:47] not repentance law you know what I'm
[1:14:51] going through
[1:14:52] it's not repentance amen
[1:15:01] I can't take this anymore if that is not
[1:15:04] repentance the Bible says God is sorrow
[1:15:09] worketh repentance true repentance
[1:15:13] always come with the word I'm sorry
[1:15:22] and King said unto the Lord my
[1:15:25] punishment is greater than I can bear
[1:15:26] behold that has driven me out this day
[1:15:31] from the face of the earth I will
[1:15:34] together from the face of the earth and
[1:15:39] from thy face shall I behave and I shall
[1:15:47] be a fugitive and a vagabond in the
[1:15:50] earth and it shall come to pass that
[1:15:54] everyone that findeth me shall sleep me
[1:15:57] and the Lord said unto him therefore
[1:16:01] whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall
[1:16:05] be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord
[1:16:10] said a mock a porn King lease and find
[1:16:17] that he should kill him
[1:16:19] praise the Lord now there Mac that's
[1:16:22] what we're Branham says it was not an
[1:16:24] outlaw Mac their mark was a spiritual
[1:16:29] Mac praise the Lord so we see right in
[1:16:33] this in this entire scripture that we
[1:16:35] have just read the map over and over the
[1:16:39] king was demonstrating was just a
[1:16:42] rejection of God's Word he refused God's
[1:16:49] correction now even when God was trying
[1:16:55] to draw him into a fellowship of
[1:16:58] reconciliation where is their brother he
[1:17:02] flame up God was about to help him he
[1:17:04] was angry to be helped he don't want to
[1:17:06] be helped
[1:17:11] and when he comes before God thinking
[1:17:16] that he's repenting trying to make
[1:17:18] himself sorrowful this thing is too hard
[1:17:21] for me to bear that is not repentance
[1:17:25] constant rejection of submitting
[1:17:28] ourselves to the Word of God
[1:17:31] now the scripture says just like I said
[1:17:34] I'm making a little review here let's
[1:17:38] let's look at a amen Solomon say in
[1:17:42] ecclesia such up to 9 amen verse 10 the
[1:17:53] mark on your hands according to
[1:17:57] revelation that will be on the hands
[1:18:01] praise the Lord
[1:18:06] well increased as a chapter 9 verse 10
[1:18:12] Solomon says here whatsoever thy hand
[1:18:18] findeth to do do it with the might for
[1:18:27] there is no work nor device nor
[1:18:30] knowledge nor wisdom in the grave
[1:18:32] whether I go with but look at the phrase
[1:18:36] whatsoever your hand father to do if the
[1:18:40] mark in the hand is deed then whatsoever
[1:18:44] your hand funny to do now compare that
[1:18:47] scripture with sin Luke chapter 9 verse
[1:18:50] 62 Luke chapter 9 verse 62
[1:19:02] Jesus over in luke 9:62
[1:19:16] and Jesus said unto him no man after
[1:19:19] putting his hand toward the plough and
[1:19:22] look back
[1:19:24] whatever your hands find it to do I mean
[1:19:31] the mark in the hand is all about our
[1:19:35] deeds
[1:19:36] where are we putting our strength
[1:19:39] whatever your hand find it to do Solomon
[1:19:43] save do it with all your mind and Jesus
[1:19:46] he has said whosoever no man after
[1:19:50] having put his hand to the plough and
[1:19:53] look back it's fit for the kingdom of
[1:19:58] God
[1:20:05] are we together
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:19] Wednesday night we look at Jeremiah
[1:20:21] chapter three that talks about the
[1:20:24] forehead of a wall and Ezekiel chapter
[1:20:28] three that speaks about the forehead
[1:20:30] that God was going to give Ezekiel to a
[1:20:33] rebellious people it's not that Ezekiel
[1:20:40] face was going to change but God was
[1:20:43] going to give him a steadfast spirit
[1:20:46] that no matter how the people frown at
[1:20:49] him no matter how they criticized him he
[1:20:51] would just be steady he would stay with
[1:20:53] the word of God and in Jeremiah chapter
[1:20:58] three God was rebuking Israel and said
[1:21:01] you have a forehead like a wall and the
[1:21:06] forehead of the wall is that she has no
[1:21:09] shame she has no shame she's not
[1:21:14] embarrassed of what she's doing she can
[1:21:19] dress anyhow it does not him but it does
[1:21:21] not bother her it's not a max it's a
[1:21:30] spirit that possessed her that makes her
[1:21:34] to dress like that and go like that and
[1:21:37] it would be a spirit the spirit of the
[1:21:39] law will possess Ezekiel and he will
[1:21:43] have the forehead like God says to be
[1:21:48] able to withstand that rebellious nation
[1:21:51] you know so like like brother Branham
[1:21:55] says here you know it's a mark on the
[1:21:58] forehead or the hand and there's
[1:22:01] knowledge or deed he said that does that
[1:22:05] that don't mean you got a big tattoo on
[1:22:08] your face
[1:22:08] amen and then in this church down there
[1:22:13] I don't know where it is and all of
[1:22:15] these people taking a tattoo of 666 on
[1:22:18] their face and and and they want to call
[1:22:20] themselves you know the the the Church
[1:22:23] of Satan or whatever they want to do you
[1:22:25] know they are just kind of for
[1:22:28] manifesting an outward manifestation of
[1:22:31] a spirit
[1:22:31] has already possessed him praise the
[1:22:36] Lord
[1:22:41] now what Ava a seed of God on a
[1:22:44] deception has gone honor their spirit
[1:22:47] and God goes and reach there and deliver
[1:22:50] that person with the tattoo on on on
[1:22:55] their body it will still be on their
[1:22:57] body but if God saved him if they repeat
[1:23:00] that tattoo on their flesh is now going
[1:23:03] to stop them from receiving the Holy
[1:23:04] Ghost I mean we have many brothers that
[1:23:11] I mean that they had tattoo on their
[1:23:13] body before they even got safe so it's
[1:23:16] just not it's a spirit that possessed
[1:23:19] the individual and mindset there no
[1:23:26] matter how you present truth to them
[1:23:28] they cannot walk in truth they will
[1:23:31] always give a reason why they have to
[1:23:34] step out and do something different
[1:23:41] all these telling evangelizing and they
[1:23:46] are talking to their people there's a
[1:23:47] digital number and they're having the
[1:23:51] people there that I mean living wrong
[1:23:53] according to the scripture then dressing
[1:23:55] wrong they will not address those things
[1:23:56] by the scripture and they keep pushing
[1:23:58] the promise I had with all of these
[1:24:01] things that is happening I mean the
[1:24:03] world will get a digital number and they
[1:24:05] are going to do a fascination and
[1:24:07] they're going to vas in you and you'll
[1:24:09] get the mark of the beast and all of
[1:24:11] that all of those things are just lying
[1:24:13] spirit continuing to deceive the people
[1:24:17] and keep them in a mindset to disobey
[1:24:21] God's Word because what would they be
[1:24:24] looking for they will be looking for a
[1:24:26] Medical Center I want to give them
[1:24:28] vaccinations or they will be looking for
[1:24:30] a system to come when it's happening
[1:24:33] right now right out of their nose
[1:24:48] praise the Lord and mind said having two
[1:24:57] other Scripture year over in Genesis
[1:25:00] let's look at that a little bit and
[1:25:02] speaks here of Jacob year dealing with
[1:25:11] his father-in-law amen
[1:25:17] Genesis chapter 31
[1:25:24] now before we read this trip to look at
[1:25:27] the story here now brother Branham says
[1:25:28] Jacob was more interested in the
[1:25:31] birthright amen
[1:25:34] he was more interested in the birthright
[1:25:37] he was taught by his mother he got the
[1:25:42] birthright even though he was he he had
[1:25:46] all of these things that was happening
[1:25:47] in his life as a plane the lying and
[1:25:51] cheating and all of that but he had this
[1:25:54] preference he brought himself honor a
[1:25:57] token message with all the struggle he
[1:26:02] had and because he identified himself
[1:26:06] with the birthright
[1:26:08] God was obligated to meet him along his
[1:26:12] way and God met him and told him I will
[1:26:17] bring you back to this place where he
[1:26:20] had a vision of angels ascending and
[1:26:23] descending I will bring you back to this
[1:26:27] place
[1:26:34] chapter teller 1 verse 29
[1:26:46] it is in the power of my hand to do you
[1:26:51] hurt but the God of your father's speak
[1:26:56] on to me yesterday yes tonight saying
[1:27:01] take thou he that thou speak net to
[1:27:07] Jacob need a good or bad the mark in the
[1:27:13] hands your days he said it is in the
[1:27:15] power of my hands it's in the power of
[1:27:23] my hands to hurt you
[1:27:25] but he says the God of your father spoke
[1:27:30] to me last night
[1:27:33] now you see there over in Revelation
[1:27:36] chapter 7 the Bible says and the Lord
[1:27:39] told insisted hurt hurt not them that
[1:27:42] had the seed of God don't hurt him
[1:27:50] so the seed of God it preserved us just
[1:27:57] like we said Wednesday night is a
[1:27:59] security it keep us
[1:28:08] and what we need is that blessed
[1:28:12] assurance that we know that we have been
[1:28:15] kept amen we have all of these people he
[1:28:25] developed in a secret place of the Most
[1:28:27] High and the RER of these signs of David
[1:28:30] I mean the the the the the burn or the
[1:28:33] brain instance they do all of these
[1:28:34] things it's all working in their mind
[1:28:37] but the heart desire they can wait for
[1:28:40] this thing to be over to get back to the
[1:28:42] nightclub they can't wait for these
[1:28:43] things to be over to run back into the
[1:28:45] street but now with all of this
[1:28:49] happening they are wearing they are
[1:28:51] religious guy meaning and and carrying
[1:28:54] themselves on hunger strike they call it
[1:28:56] fasting and all of these things but
[1:28:58] their inner desire the warmth is to be
[1:29:01] over so they can get back in the street
[1:29:02] and start their adulterous ways Genesis
[1:29:08] chapter 39 verse 3
[1:29:24] this is Joseph verse three and his
[1:29:30] master saw that the Lord was with him
[1:29:33] and that the law may all that he did to
[1:29:38] prosper in his hand that's his DS all he
[1:29:43] did to prosper in his hands so Joseph
[1:29:49] was wearing a Mac of the Sun of
[1:29:51] prosperity they knew that wherever he
[1:29:53] lays his on it will prosper he never had
[1:30:01] a written on his back or written on his
[1:30:03] forehead they just knew what if I knew
[1:30:06] that I can trust this man
[1:30:08] whenever he put his hands to do prosper
[1:30:12] because he doing right he do it with
[1:30:13] dedication
[1:30:23] praise the Lord when are we putting our
[1:30:30] hands to do amen
[1:30:37] it's not an out what Mike is a spiritual
[1:30:40] man mark of the beast' 1961 brother
[1:30:46] Branham says the fear of God is the
[1:30:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:30:52] he said the seal of God is the baptism
[1:30:56] of the Holy Ghost I break this code like
[1:30:57] this so we can be able to see it the
[1:31:00] mark of the beast is to reject it to
[1:31:06] reject one to reject the baptism of the
[1:31:08] Holy Ghost
[1:31:09] to just go to church and be religious
[1:31:11] and never get to the place where God has
[1:31:14] a complete control of your life where we
[1:31:22] cannot submit to God enough we submit to
[1:31:26] God and we get tired and we get back
[1:31:29] from there we get back to ourselves get
[1:31:31] back to our own minds praise the Lord
[1:31:37] the seal of God is the baptism of the
[1:31:40] Holy Ghost the mark of the beast is to
[1:31:43] reject it and he said receive ye the
[1:31:47] Holy Ghost and that's what I'm saying
[1:31:50] this morning receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] praise the Lord
[1:31:56] young people receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:31:59] we cannot go on the experience of our
[1:32:02] parents you cannot carry your child on
[1:32:06] your experience you might expose them to
[1:32:08] that experience of the baptism of the
[1:32:11] Holy Ghost work they are submitting
[1:32:15] himself to to the Word of God it's not
[1:32:18] honor I 7 but it's a desire in their
[1:32:21] heart to submit himself to the world
[1:32:26] that is our escape from this plague is
[1:32:30] the Holy Ghost that is the thing that
[1:32:32] was that will make us to survive
[1:32:34] whatever may come
[1:32:36] whatever may come that'll be whatever it
[1:32:41] is I'm talking to a brother yesterday
[1:32:45] from France a good friend of mine
[1:32:47] I mean lovely brother he's he I mean he
[1:32:49] used to be my pastor and I mean we were
[1:32:51] just good friends and we were fellowship
[1:32:53] in you know and he was talking about you
[1:32:55] know III mean this this another to
[1:32:58] reality and I told him I said slow we
[1:32:59] can't doubt these things there's a fudgy
[1:33:02] you know the file genius that is out
[1:33:05] there into the world and in and it's a
[1:33:09] radiation from the 5g that is affecting
[1:33:11] us I told him I said to me I said bro
[1:33:13] watch this if that is what is happening
[1:33:16] that thing has been launched ever since
[1:33:18] it's in the atmosphere we've been
[1:33:20] breathing it so if we find out today is
[1:33:24] not today that we're going to higher
[1:33:26] honor our bed because there's a foggy
[1:33:30] out there if it is there is there but
[1:33:32] the Holy Ghost in the believer will see
[1:33:35] us he will help us we have a promise we
[1:33:39] have a promise the Holy Spirit sifted
[1:33:44] the air that we breathe praise the Lord
[1:33:48] he's freeing the water that we drink
[1:33:51] when we bless our food he bless him for
[1:33:56] it to be a blessing to our body so no
[1:33:59] matter what is happening out there our
[1:34:02] only escape from it is the baptism of
[1:34:05] the Holy Ghost we need to go back to the
[1:34:09] altar and receive the Holy Ghost and I
[1:34:11] believe this morning you can receive it
[1:34:14] right in your room you can receive it
[1:34:16] right where you are if we just open our
[1:34:21] heart and submit it to the word church
[1:34:24] membership is not the Holy Ghost praise
[1:34:31] the Lord
[1:34:31] I mean what are you married in the
[1:34:35] message of Mary out of the message it's
[1:34:36] not a holy goal we must have a personal
[1:34:38] experience we must have a personal
[1:34:42] experience I mean the devil will bring
[1:34:45] all of those things to our mind and try
[1:34:47] to turn our spear and go into inna or
[1:34:49] your heart what is your heart desire in
[1:34:51] are you submitting to God's Word
[1:35:03] whatever he did prosper in his hands
[1:35:07] Joseph had a mock praise the Lord now
[1:35:13] let me let me let me share with you what
[1:35:16] the Lord kind of a dare with me
[1:35:18] yesterday
[1:35:21] Genesis chapter 3
[1:35:23] I read his Scripture and even when I was
[1:35:26] driving home on Wednesday now I was
[1:35:29] asking myself in the car Isis I wonder
[1:35:32] why I read that scripture I really did
[1:35:35] not draw out what I thought was there oh
[1:35:39] but God never failed me God never feel
[1:35:46] praise the Lord
[1:35:48] he never feel amen praise the Lord
[1:35:54] Genesis chapter 3 amen he said I would
[1:36:00] put an amateur between D and the woman
[1:36:04] and between the woman between thy seed
[1:36:09] and her seed and it shall bruise the
[1:36:14] head and thou shalt bruise his heel now
[1:36:17] this is where I was sitting
[1:36:20] yesterday I mean I was just I said oh
[1:36:23] God I mean and I mean and the Lord just
[1:36:25] beautifully open a word to me we know
[1:36:30] that the woman by nature does not
[1:36:32] produce a seed she has to receive it
[1:36:38] amen so the seed of the word does not
[1:36:43] combi our natural birth we have to
[1:36:45] receive it just like Jesus said receive
[1:36:48] ye the Holy Ghost married Navajo desire
[1:36:55] to be the bring for the virgin birth she
[1:37:00] received it from the angel bee
[1:37:03] to mean I'm calling to your word so the
[1:37:07] promise of the warmest seed is a promise
[1:37:10] of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:12] she received a C and there is a man that
[1:37:18] changes her
[1:37:19] when a woman receive a seed is a mark
[1:37:23] that changes her let's see what the
[1:37:26] scripture says Paul Galatians chapter 6
[1:37:30] Paul in Galatians chapter 6 oh this
[1:37:36] never came so beautiful to me yesterday
[1:37:37] sitting down I said all God have mercy
[1:37:42] praise the Lord the seed of the woman a
[1:37:47] type of the church a type of the bride
[1:37:50] she received God's instruction we cannot
[1:37:54] manufacture it we cannot produce it but
[1:37:56] we bring our bother in obedience to what
[1:37:59] His Word says amen for in Galatians
[1:38:09] chapter 6 verse 17 he says from
[1:38:16] henceforth let no man trouble me for a
[1:38:21] beard in my body the marks of the Lord
[1:38:25] Jesus are bared in my body I'm conceived
[1:38:29] with the word what is happening to me is
[1:38:32] not an outward expression is something
[1:38:34] I'm bearing in my body
[1:38:36] he received the word just like a woman
[1:38:41] received the seed when God said the seed
[1:38:44] of the woman is now what she will
[1:38:45] produce is what she will receive from
[1:38:48] God by obedience and that's the same
[1:38:50] thing with the church for refer to death
[1:38:56] in first Timothy chapter 2 verse 15 he
[1:39:00] said in childbearing she shall be saved
[1:39:02] in childbearing she shall be saved that
[1:39:09] goes back to Genesis chapter 3 there is
[1:39:14] no salvation in just having and not what
[1:39:16] try what is the parallel date receiving
[1:39:22] the word when she received the Word of
[1:39:24] God to be able to bring for the life of
[1:39:28] Christ and childbearing she shall be
[1:39:32] safe
[1:39:34] 1st Peter chapter 1 verse 23 first Peter
[1:39:41] chapter 1 verse 23 Peter says it here
[1:39:51] amen
[1:39:53] that we are born of the seed
[1:39:56] incorruptible being born again not of
[1:40:02] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[1:40:07] the Word of God which liveth and Abbar
[1:40:11] forever
[1:40:12] that's the seed of the woman the Word of
[1:40:15] God is the seed of the woman in the
[1:40:19] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:40:21] with God and the Word was God and
[1:40:23] everything would bring full of his kind
[1:40:30] and that's the Mack of God that is the
[1:40:35] seal of the Holy Ghost when a person is
[1:40:37] born again by the word now born by a
[1:40:40] church identification but born again by
[1:40:43] the Word of God
[1:40:44] the seed incorruptible that is the see
[1:40:47] that we are possessed we are pregnant
[1:40:49] with that incorruptible seed it's a seed
[1:40:53] that brings us in subjection to God's
[1:40:57] words he will have the rule over you if
[1:40:59] his seed having rule over the church is
[1:41:02] a seed having rule over the bride we are
[1:41:05] submitting our set to the word that's
[1:41:10] the seed of God God gave a promise where
[1:41:13] he filled his church in when we received
[1:41:16] our seed there is nothing that comes
[1:41:18] from out war that can affect us because
[1:41:20] this is see incorruptible in his body
[1:41:23] even death itself
[1:41:25] Paul said death where is your sting
[1:41:28] Deborah self can I
[1:41:30] to us because I see incorruptible is in
[1:41:33] this body
[1:41:34] oh my praise the Lord and you know
[1:41:48] better brain I'm talking about this boy

[1:50:42] realize that a day that there can be a
[1:50:46] show right now that they are passed from
[1:50:48] death unto life when we receive Christ
[1:50:51] the Holy Spirit we just rise above the
[1:50:57] word then we know we are already raising
[1:51:02] with him and we are just waiting for
[1:51:06] that change where death we seized in the
[1:51:11] muttering not in motoring where death
[1:51:17] with ease in the motoring there ceases
[1:51:22] in the motor room of the believer when
[1:51:24] he's possessed of the Holy Ghost for
[1:51:28] death for for him is just a step over
[1:51:31] the river but in his body deficits are
[1:51:37] we together just waiting for that change
[1:51:44] where Deborah sees in a motoring these
[1:51:47] little Williams of motor life that's
[1:51:52] attorney in our senses will be redeemed
[1:52:01] bridgeberg Brenham said he says like
[1:52:05] some of these comedians going down and
[1:52:07] telling these jokes and carrying on and
[1:52:11] women carrying on a way to do and men
[1:52:14] together it just reminds me of a little
[1:52:18] boy going through a gravy i whistling
[1:52:20] trying to make himself believe he's not
[1:52:24] scared the people are scared to death a
[1:52:27] man they were just such a fear I mean
[1:52:31] that is that is what we would deal with
[1:52:33] when all of this is over it will not be
[1:52:36] the plague again will just be the fear
[1:52:38] that is on the mind of the people people
[1:52:40] can even trust their own hands they can
[1:52:43] trust their own hands they wear gloves
[1:52:46] to eat if you're left with them they
[1:52:52] would stay six feet from their hands oh
[1:52:56] my goodness me praise the Lord they
[1:53:01] can't trust their own hands these hands
[1:53:03] that I serve you from the day you were

[1:53:07] your own hands
[1:53:08] oh yeah we must wash our hands we must
[1:53:11] take all the precaution but let them not
[1:53:13] just fill this thing in in our mind well
[1:53:20] you see that a piece of chicken in a
[1:53:22] bowl to eat although I shouldn't touch
[1:53:24] over my hands my goodness

[1:59:15] believers to be humble for the believers
[1:59:18] to keep his face between his knees on
[1:59:20] his knees seeking the face of God oh my
[1:59:28] praise the Lord I realized I've kept you
[1:59:33] a little bit long our radius one United
[1:59:39] on a one head brother Branham shed a
[1:59:41] little bit of a long coat but I kept it
[1:59:44] to read it to close the service of faith
[1:59:50] the Bible plainly says that all that was
[1:59:55] not sealed with the Holy Ghost received
[1:59:59] the mark of the beast
[2:00:00] I read that again the Bible plainly says
[2:00:04] that all that was not sealed with the
[2:00:09] Holy Ghost if John received the Holy
[2:00:11] Ghost in his mother warm
[2:00:13] we can pray our babies to have the Holy
[2:00:15] Ghost we can pray our little ones to
[2:00:19] have the Holy Ghost praise the Lord you
[2:00:23] know I was I was thinking about this in
[2:00:25] and and just and just reading Barbra I'm
[2:00:27] talking about you know the gorge may
[2:00:29] fall in there in India and he never
[2:00:31] touched those animals do you know that
[2:00:33] it's even said that this play can not
[2:00:36] affect an animal this coronavirus can
[2:00:40] not affect an animal I was just looking
[2:00:48] at that look in there Appa and then I
[2:00:51] listened to someone a nurse saying
[2:00:54] they're giving a report that people are
[2:00:58] house pet should not worry it does not
[2:01:00] affect an animal and it's always like
[2:01:03] that when it's the son of
[2:01:06] Osmond the Bible plainly says they're
[2:01:15] all there was not sealed with the Holy
[2:01:21] Ghost received the mark of the beast all
[2:01:25] that did not have the seal of God in
[2:01:27] their forehead had the mark of the beast
[2:01:31] you have got one of it now he says I did
[2:01:41] like to test it just a little bit and
[2:01:45] see where we are standing
[2:01:48] oh the mark of the beast remember is a
[2:01:52] religious Mack settling and you might be
[2:01:57] filled with religion you have all kinds
[2:02:02] of religion
[2:02:02] you can shout you you you can I mean you
[2:02:05] you can feel religious that doesn't save
[2:02:08] you at all you can just be a religious
[2:02:14] fanatics religious fanatics can never
[2:02:20] come to the place of submitting to the
[2:02:22] word can never be able to bring our body
[2:02:25] to a devotion a devotion for a believer
[2:02:30] is to get to attention can you imagine
[2:02:35] being in the military when when the
[2:02:38] sergeant comes around or the major comes
[2:02:41] around and he calls for attention and
[2:02:43] you are telling like this when we cannot
[2:02:48] bring ourselves to discipline as a
[2:02:51] believer
[2:02:51] we cannot be we cannot be able to
[2:02:54] establish our own personal devotion
[2:02:56] personal discipline with the Lord I will
[2:03:00] seek your face early in the morning
[2:03:02] David says and at night gets to that
[2:03:06] place where we can have a communion with
[2:03:08] God all we are we are relying on it's a
[2:03:12] church service or we go on the on the
[2:03:14] internet and play what is on the voice
[2:03:17] of God website and what is on you two
[2:03:19] all of those things are beautiful but
[2:03:20] you as a believer you must have a
[2:03:23] personal time with God
[2:03:25] were you not hearing through another
[2:03:28] person you are reading God's Word
[2:03:30] you are speaking for God in prayer and
[2:03:32] expecting God to speak back to you you
[2:03:40] can just be a religious fanatics if you
[2:03:44] want to be touched at taste not handle
[2:03:47] not smell not that doesn't have one
[2:03:51] thing to do with the Holy Ghost it
