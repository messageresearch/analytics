[42:27] evening you love the Lord amen amen if
[42:29] you have your Bibles tonight we want to
[42:32] uh go straight to the scripture we don't
[42:33] want to prolong the time we want to turn
[42:35] to the Book of Genesis the first chapter
[42:38] the Book of Genesis the first chapter
[42:41] and we also want to just take this
[42:42] moment to greet you all in the name of
[42:44] the Lord Jesus we sure count it an honor

[42:48] again and I know it's a a little uh just
[42:51] to stop over here tonight but I'm sure
[42:53] thankful for the opportunity to come and
[42:56] to see you all and speak to you again
[42:57] from the message of the hour we sure
[42:59] appreciate Brother Juan and his
[43:01] friendship and the open door here to to
[43:03] visit the Believers and amen I believe
[43:06] God's doing some wonderful things among
[43:07] us Amen in the Book of Genesis the first
[43:10] chapter I want to begin reading in the
[43:13] first verse it's a very familiar reading
[43:15] here in Genesis 1:1 the Bible says in
[43:19] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[43:22] the Earth and the Earth was without form
[43:26] and void and darkness was upon the face
[43:29] of the deep I want you to watch these
[43:32] next words and the spirit of God moved
[43:36] upon the face of the waters amen the
[43:40] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[43:43] waters in the book of Deuteronomy the
[43:46] 32nd chapter Deuteronomy the 32nd
[43:49] chapter in the 11th
[43:51] verse why you're turning there brother
[43:53] why I don't know if it' be possible to
[43:54] turn this air off up here here but I
[43:56] feel a little cool air if that's
[43:57] possible maybe just to turn it up in
[44:00] Deuteronomy 32 and verse
[44:03] 11 I know you're familiar with this
[44:05] scripture the prophet of God uses it in
[44:08] his message as the eagle stirreth up her
[44:10] nest in the 11th verse he says as an
[44:13] eagle stirreth up her nest now watch
[44:17] this word here fluth over her young
[44:21] spreadeth abroad her wings and taketh
[44:23] them and beareth them on her wings now
[44:27] watch this so the Lord alone did lead
[44:29] him and there was no strange god with
[44:32] him now what I like about verse 11 is
[44:36] the same word in Genesis 1 2 and the
[44:38] spirit of God moved the same word moved
[44:41] is now in Deuteronomy 32:11 and it's as
[44:45] fluth so the spirit of God moved here
[44:48] the spirit flutter Earth over her young
[44:50] spread abroad her wings and taketh them
[44:53] and beareth them on her wings amen we
[44:55] ask Lord this evening to add the
[44:57] blessing to the reading of his word as
[44:58] you can have your seats here this
[45:00] afternoon uh how many thanks the Lord
[45:02] for the reading of the word of God Amen
[45:05] we we truly believe the word of God is
[45:07] the truth it's the infallible amen
[45:09] inspired word of the Living God uh here
[45:12] from those passages of scripture tonight
[45:14] I want to for just a few moments if I
[45:16] could maybe just to speak to you here
[45:18] and if I would title this tonight I want
[45:20] to talk to you for a few moments on a
[45:22] move of God Amen a move of God you know
[45:26] uh as we were just singing the song a
[45:27] few moments ago my Lord knows just what
[45:31] I need I was just uh some time ago
[45:33] praying and in prayer uh this thought
[45:35] come to me and I pinned it down uh just
[45:37] in prayer it struck my heart that what
[45:39] we think we need amen is one thing but
[45:42] what God knows we need is another amen
[45:45] there's times that we think we know what
[45:47] we need but in reality we really don't
[45:50] know what we need amen but that's when
[45:52] we're thankful that we serve a God who
[45:54] knows exactly
[45:56] what we need and I believe tonight if we
[45:58] would all be honest with ourselves we
[46:00] need amen a move of God how many would
[46:03] agree we need a move of God we need a
[46:05] move of God that comes from God and
[46:07] comes from his word now in the message
[46:10] of the hour brother brand will tell us
[46:12] about 47 different times he will use
[46:15] this term move of God Amen now when you
[46:18] start thinking about a move of God you
[46:20] realize amen that in order to have a
[46:22] move of God there has to be a power
[46:24] supplied Amen to produce that move so
[46:27] God must Supply the power Amen in order
[46:31] to start a move of God now the prophet
[46:33] says it very beautiful he says a man
[46:35] amen cannot lay in the presence of God
[46:38] and a church cannot stay in the presence
[46:40] of God Amen under repentance unless the
[46:43] Holy Spirit comes down amen and gives
[46:46] unction and power to start a move of God
[46:49] in there amen among those people so in
[46:51] other words amen that you cannot
[46:54] separate a move of God God from the
[46:56] presence of God now many people we find
[46:59] in this world they actually fear and
[47:01] even around the ranks of what we call
[47:03] the message amen people will actually
[47:05] begin to fear a move of God now the
[47:09] reason they do that amen is because so
[47:11] many has turned amen a move of God into
[47:15] fanaticism now let me just start off by
[47:17] saying this amen and let's remove all
[47:19] doubt amen that God still moves how many
[47:22] can witness tonight amen that God still
[47:25] moves amen I believe amen that God still
[47:28] moves in our singing I believe it I
[47:30] believe that God Amen still moves in our
[47:32] preaching I believe that God moves in
[47:34] our worship you know amen I believe that
[47:36] God still moves in prayer lines I
[47:38] believe like the prophet of God said
[47:41] amen that God still moves in altar call
[47:43] he said the oldfashioned altar call amen
[47:46] they're out of style today amen but God
[47:49] still moves in them amen they're out of
[47:52] style to the world Amen but God still
[47:55] moves in them he said now watch can't
[47:57] you feel it amen moving on you church
[48:00] now amen I love that word the prophet
[48:02] uses there he says can't you feel it now
[48:04] let's identify amen what he's asking you
[48:07] if you can feel he said Can You Feel the
[48:10] holy ghost moving on you so it's not
[48:13] just feeling the singing right or
[48:16] feeling the the the atmosphere or the
[48:18] emotion the crow but it's actually to
[48:21] feel the spirit of God now amen in the
[48:24] message the deity of Jesus Jesus Christ
[48:26] he said who are you this morning excuse
[48:29] me who is Christ Jesus amen he's in you
[48:32] as much as you'll let him be see he's
[48:34] pressing sorry trying to get into you
[48:37] Amen to move into you today now think
[48:39] about this Jesus Christ is pressing how
[48:42] many believes he's pressing he's
[48:44] pressing amen trying to get into you
[48:48] Amen to move into you and you stand off
[48:50] and wonder and look and gaze and hold
[48:52] back a while don't do that excuse me
[48:55] move right straight into the kingdom of
[48:57] God now watch a prophet the hour is here
[48:59] how many believes the hour is here you
[49:02] believe it I don't believe the hour is
[49:03] coming I believe it's here amen I
[49:05] believe it's here amen the prophet said
[49:08] now watch move right straight in the
[49:10] kingdom of God oh how I love him see his
[49:13] power is moving what makes the people
[49:16] cry and shout and go on what's the
[49:18] matter it's the holy ghost moving in
[49:21] them if they could only realize and
[49:23] embrace him embrace the holy ghost
[49:26] believing in him hug him to your bosom
[49:29] he said live right and do nothing that
[49:31] would hinder him say oh Lord I want you
[49:33] I want you to stand by me I'm going to
[49:35] stand by you father and as you do he's
[49:38] just pressing to get into you because he
[49:41] wants in there amen he's wooing to you
[49:44] him he's wooing you to him amen all the
[49:47] time now amen how many believes the holy
[49:49] spirit is here tonight wooing I I
[49:51] believe as the prophet said the spirit
[49:53] of God Broods over the congregation amen
[49:56] then the spirit of God is here tonight
[49:58] and he's wooing you to him all the time
[50:01] now why is he wooing you to him he's
[50:03] wooing you to him in order to gain
[50:06] access into your life now you all know
[50:08] that as we come in church sometimes amen
[50:10] and while you're sitting there amen
[50:12] you'll feel a pressure you'll feel maybe
[50:14] a pressure in the song service or a
[50:16] pressure when you go to raise your hands
[50:18] now I want to say this not all the
[50:20] pressure amen that you feel in a service
[50:23] it's not always a negative pressure
[50:25] because the prophet said now he's here
[50:28] and he's more willing to do it than you
[50:30] are to receive it amen Jesus Christ the
[50:33] son of God is here he's more willing to
[50:35] do it than you are to receive it see
[50:37] could you imagine brother Bosworth
[50:39] expressing this ocean out here piled up
[50:42] into one tube about two foot or two foot
[50:44] across amen what a pressure there would
[50:47] be trying to find amen one little
[50:50] crevice to leak through now if you had
[50:52] all the water that was in the ocean amen
[50:54] and you put all that water up on a pipe
[50:57] amen and that pipe has got to contain
[50:59] that water amen but the only way it can
[51:02] get in there is it finds a crack amen
[51:04] that it can get into and then flow
[51:06] through that how much pressure amen is
[51:09] laying upon that pipe he said now divide
[51:12] that by 10,000 time thousand and you'll
[51:14] find the pressure of the holy spirit
[51:17] amen trying to find that little crevice
[51:19] in the heart amen that true Faith Can
[51:22] leak into there and to heal you amen the
[51:26] pressure that you feel in the service
[51:28] amen is coming from the power of the
[51:30] Holy Ghost amen that is building upon
[51:33] song after song Amen and word after word
[51:36] and sermon amen the pressure begins to
[51:39] build amen and what he's doing is he's
[51:41] looking for a
[51:43] heart that he can get into and heal
[51:46] through that heart other place he said
[51:48] God's standing there amen like a great
[51:50] pressure don't you be afraid amen
[51:52] there'll be too many of them you cannot
[51:55] exhaust God could you imagine a little
[51:57] rat about that long little mouse out of
[52:00] the great Garners of Egypt saying I
[52:01] better eat one grain of wheat a day I
[52:03] might run out before the next Harvest
[52:05] could you imagine a little fish about
[52:07] that long amen swimming out in the
[52:09] middle of the ocean say I better drink
[52:10] of this water and sparely because you
[52:13] know it might go dry sometime amen
[52:15] that's trying to exhaust God's goodness
[52:17] and mercy to his people he wants to
[52:20] bless you amen he's ready he's pressing
[52:23] could you imagine taking all the waters
[52:25] in the Earth the Seas and everything and
[52:29] piling it in one 4ft pipe and put up
[52:31] there amen the pressure would be on the
[52:34] bottom of it amen trying to find a
[52:36] little crevice to leak its way through
[52:39] he said that's like the pressure of the
[52:41] holy spirit amen trying to come down on
[52:44] every life amen the pressure of the holy
[52:47] spirit is trying to get into our young
[52:49] people he's trying to get into our
[52:51] marriages he's trying to get into our
[52:53] churches amen and the reason he's trying
[52:55] to get in there is so that his Spirit
[52:58] can move in there amen and a spiritual
[53:00] move of God Amen will fix more than 5
[53:03] minutes amen that we could counsel all
[53:06] night long amen I believe that when God
[53:08] moves things change listen friends when
[53:11] God moved on the face of the waters he
[53:13] took a garden of chaos and created an
[53:16] Eden out of it when the spirit of God
[53:18] moved and if that Spirit can move upon
[53:21] natural creation then what can it do in
[53:23] the lives of sons Daughters of God Amen
[53:27] God Is Right amen his word is Right
[53:30] others are not right that's right as
[53:32] long as they stay with the word but when
[53:35] you leave the word then you leave God
[53:37] cuz God is watching over his word amen
[53:40] why is he watching over his word to
[53:41] vindicate it because he's got to make it
[53:44] real he's got to make it act he said
[53:47] that's why you people are hungering for
[53:49] Revival it's time for these things to be
[53:51] here and if you ever believe me to know
[53:54] what I was talking about about you
[53:55] accept that amen the hour is here
[53:59] now you accept that the hour is here now
[54:03] but the trouble of it is we got so many
[54:06] absolutes we don't know where we're tied
[54:08] to and I feel religious he said I want
[54:10] to say it we got so many ties one
[54:13] pulling this way one that way one
[54:15] against the other how do the people know
[54:17] what to do he said and the pressure of
[54:19] the holy spirit is coming down trying to
[54:22] find a place Amen to move himself into
[54:26] that he can work word by word amen word
[54:30] by word so there's all kinds of pressure
[54:33] there's the pressure of this is against
[54:35] that amen and this don't believe this
[54:37] and that amen there's all kinds of
[54:39] pressure amen but there's a more
[54:41] positive pressure amen then all the
[54:43] divisions and the confusions and the
[54:45] arguments amen there's a pressure of the
[54:47] Holy Ghost and he's trying to get into
[54:50] you Amen to work word by word now when
[54:52] you think about this you have to realize
[54:54] it's the unseen force of the Holy Spirit
[54:58] the prophet said the doctor said to me
[54:59] long ago said Billy don't you think them
[55:02] people's excited amen them people just
[55:04] excited no sir I don't he said well
[55:07] that's nervousness because they scream
[55:09] and they holler and they go on I said
[55:11] Doctor you mean to tell me that nerves
[55:13] can be excited without something to
[55:15] excite them amen something has to excite
[55:18] them he said so what's there I said it's
[55:21] the Unseen force of the Holy Ghost that
[55:25] moving among us and it excites that Born
[55:28] Again Spirits listen friends the Holy
[55:30] Ghost the rain will fall on the just and
[55:33] the unjust am but here's the difference
[55:36] it will fall on the unjust but it will
[55:38] not move to the unjust it'll fall upon
[55:41] the unjust but they'll just be a
[55:43] partaker of the same nourishment amen
[55:46] but unto you that have eyes to see and
[55:48] are heart to receive when the Holy Ghost
[55:51] falls on you the pressure of the Holy
[55:54] Ghost finds on way into your soul and he
[55:57] begins to work word by word by
[56:00] word glory to God hallelujah and the
[56:04] spirit of God will excite that Born
[56:07] Again Spirit he said see it brings an
[56:09] excitement of that spirit amen the power
[56:11] of God Amen just Foams down through amen
[56:15] Faith cometh by hearing and the Holy
[56:18] Ghost takes the word and he spreads it
[56:20] out over the people Amen to catch it
[56:22] with a power amen that reads generated
[56:25] Born Again life amen something has got
[56:28] to cry out when that word from the
[56:32] spirit gets in that heart listen friends
[56:34] every one of you tonight have got a
[56:36] crevice in your heart amen and the power
[56:39] of the Holy Ghost is here tonight amen
[56:41] looking for a way to get into your heart
[56:44] to work through your life word by
[56:48] word see that's why it's more than just
[56:51] shouting right that's why it's more than
[56:53] just dancing We Believe believe in all
[56:55] those things amen but the unjust will
[56:57] not allow the word amen to work through
[57:01] them but there's a bride on the earth
[57:03] tonight who is a word born bride and the
[57:06] only thing she moves by is the word see
[57:10] that's why the Bible said amen that the
[57:12] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[57:15] will of man but holy men of God spake
[57:18] amen as they were moved by the Holy
[57:20] Ghost amen go read your Bible do you
[57:22] realize how Paul amen wrote the things
[57:25] he wrote is there was a crevice in his
[57:27] heart amen listen he was in all kinds of
[57:30] pressure he was under prison pressure he
[57:33] was under political pressure amen Paul
[57:35] was under all kinds of pressure but he
[57:37] did not write about those things amen he
[57:40] wrote about those things that got into
[57:42] him amen and what got into him was the
[57:45] Revelation amen of the god of Abraham
[57:48] Isaac and Jacob and so Paul did not
[57:50] write about the prison he did not write
[57:52] about the conditions he wrote of the
[57:54] anointing the word the Revelation that
[57:57] was coming to him can I give you another
[57:58] example amen look at John on the aisle
[58:01] of patmas Do You Realize John was under
[58:03] pressure yes yes he was on the aisle of
[58:07] patmas Amen where the most where the
[58:09] most criminal of criminals were put amen
[58:12] do you realize if it was not for history
[58:14] we would have no understanding of what
[58:17] Paul or what John Rather was in on the
[58:20] aisle of patmas brother brother Juan
[58:22] he's surrounded by snakes he surrounded
[58:25] by scorpions he's surrounded by all
[58:27] kinds of horrible things but nowhere in
[58:29] the Book of Revelation do you read about
[58:31] the Scorpions do you read about the
[58:34] snakes you know why because John did not
[58:36] think those things amen were worth his
[58:39] time Amen to record in the word so what
[58:42] he did record was the things he seen
[58:45] when he got carried away by the spirit
[58:48] oh Church of the Living God that's what
[58:50] we need to do is get carried away amen
[58:53] by the spirit of God
[58:55] until we see beyond the things we see we
[58:57] hear beyond the things we hear we
[59:00] believe beyond the things our eyes and
[59:02] our smell and our feel is declared we
[59:04] can believe things by the super sense we
[59:07] can declare things by that super
[59:10] sense when the spirit of God moves amen
[59:14] I love this the prophet said in the last
[59:15] days when the evening lights begin to
[59:17] shine eyes will become open and you'll
[59:20] see where you're going he said then the
[59:23] body is already for formed amen standing
[59:26] upon its feet amen taking motion amen
[59:30] moving by the Holy
[59:33] Spirit what the same one that moved up
[59:36] on the prophets that wrote the Bible is
[59:39] the same Holy Ghost that's moving in a
[59:42] body filled with the Holy Ghost out of
[59:44] every organization every Kindred every
[59:47] tongue and every
[59:49] people see then the holy ghost moving
[59:52] among the church is what's causing
[59:54] people
[59:55] Amen to Hunger for More Than Just Church
[59:58] yes it's causing them to Hunger for More
[1:00:00] Than Just hearing intellectual sermons
[1:00:02] it's causing something in them to hunger
[1:00:05] for the realities of God see it's begin
[1:00:08] to be a talk Among Us he said and oh may
[1:00:11] it revive us to a spot that we'll go to
[1:00:13] searching hungering and pulling for the
[1:00:16] realities of God because God is a
[1:00:20] reality do you realize the Gospel of
[1:00:22] Jesus Christ is more than a book
[1:00:26] it's more than a letter the gospel is a
[1:00:29] reality brother said stay on the highway
[1:00:32] stay on the road map go the way the
[1:00:34] disciples went go the word they preached
[1:00:37] live it testify I know it to be the
[1:00:39] truth he said see signs to the last days
[1:00:42] God living in man it's God's program God
[1:00:45] has to find somebody that he can trust
[1:00:48] somebody he can have confidence in and
[1:00:51] can have confidence in God that can
[1:00:53] believe him said and then when he finds
[1:00:55] such a man that he can put his
[1:00:56] confidence and his power in amen a man
[1:00:59] that'll follow the road that'll stay
[1:01:01] right on the map see go right on till he
[1:01:04] comes to the place of power now watch
[1:01:06] faith will lead him to that because he's
[1:01:08] got faith in the word he'll lead him to
[1:01:10] the power and power will lead him to the
[1:01:12] promise amen so faith will lead him to
[1:01:15] the power amen and the power will lead
[1:01:17] him to the promise and then when he gets
[1:01:19] the promise and begins to manifest what
[1:01:21] does it do amen it blinds the eyes of
[1:01:25] the unbelieving lukewarm amen Creed
[1:01:27] servant brother can you remember that
[1:01:29] point for a few moments when a man finds
[1:01:32] the faith of God and the faith of God
[1:01:34] leads him to the power of God the power
[1:01:37] of God will lead him to the promise of
[1:01:38] God and when that man receives the power
[1:01:41] and the promise it will open his eyes
[1:01:44] amen but it'll blind his Creed servant
[1:01:47] lukewarm unbeliev brother he said that's
[1:01:49] what he did back there in the days of
[1:01:51] Jesus he said if I would have not come
[1:01:54] you would not have known sin but now
[1:01:56] that I'm here now that I'm here you have
[1:01:58] no excuse and today if God made his
[1:02:01] promise that he would send the holy
[1:02:02] ghost in the last days these things
[1:02:05] would take place you could have doubted
[1:02:07] it but now he's come and he's doing
[1:02:10] it and the world is without excuse It's
[1:02:14] aund cross Nation after Nation amen
[1:02:16] Thunder rather after place after a place
[1:02:19] let cover the Earth they're without
[1:02:20] excuse they wouldn't have known it if
[1:02:22] God hadn't come and brought it but he's
[1:02:24] brought to us now and so then it's a
[1:02:27] reality it's the realities of following
[1:02:30] the word following the truth so faith
[1:02:33] will lead a man to the power of God and
[1:02:36] the power of God will lead a man the
[1:02:37] promise of God and the next step is that
[1:02:40] promise will be manifested in the life
[1:02:43] of the believer and the word will become
[1:02:45] a reality amen because there'll be
[1:02:48] following the truth of God listen

[1:04:53] refreshed yeah well glory to God anyhow
[1:04:57] are you hearing me amen I'm talking
[1:04:59] about somebody that believes the spirit
[1:05:00] of God can move and change the situation
[1:05:04] remember said many times systems lead
[1:05:05] men but down in their heart they want to
[1:05:09] see the move of God come on Church down
[1:05:12] in their heart where that crevice is
[1:05:15] where the pressure of the holy spirit is
[1:05:17] where the power of God can leak in there
[1:05:20] they want to see the move of God then we
[1:05:22] find out the devil don't do one thing
[1:05:24] he'll do another so if the devil won't
[1:05:27] do one thing he'll do another and then
[1:05:30] he will mess up something or G up
[1:05:32] something and it makes them kindly pull
[1:05:34] back a little bit now do you know what
[1:05:36] that is that's a
[1:05:38] devil any time something's fixing to
[1:05:41] break is when everything else falls
[1:05:44] apart now y'all know I'm talking to you
[1:05:47] said getting an airplane he said and go
[1:05:50] up in the airplane and take off and he
[1:05:52] said the closer you get to the sound
[1:05:54] barrier he said The more rattling the
[1:05:56] plane becomes he said you feel like it's
[1:05:58] going to fall apart he said it starts
[1:06:00] shaking he said now listen if it was up
[1:06:02] to you you would pull back he said and
[1:06:05] if you pull back you'll never break the
[1:06:06] sound barrier you'll never know there's
[1:06:09] something beyond what you're used to
[1:06:11] that's right but if you can pull the
[1:06:14] propeller and set your wings and no
[1:06:17] matter how loud the plane Roars no
[1:06:20] matter how much shaking going on you
[1:06:22] know as soon as I break that sound
[1:06:24] barrier there's an unlimited speed come
[1:06:27] on church and the prophet of God said
[1:06:29] amen we got to break our own sound
[1:06:31] barrier come on is that what he said he
[1:06:34] said we got to break our own sound
[1:06:35] barrier he said and when we break the
[1:06:37] unbelief barrier he said there'll be
[1:06:39] unlimited Revival there'll be unlimited
[1:06:42] anointing there'll be unlimited Mir are
[1:06:44] you hearing me church I believe it's
[1:06:46] time for the Bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:06:48] break every barrier I think it's time to
[1:06:51] break the sound barrier I think it's
[1:06:53] time to break the the doubt barrier I
[1:06:55] think it's time to break the complex
[1:06:57] barrier I think it's time to break every
[1:06:59] barrier and break out into a dimension
[1:07:01] with God Amen where we can go beyond the
[1:07:04] things that we're used
[1:07:06] to hey come on Church well that's going
[1:07:09] to fall apart so we better pull back
[1:07:11] amen that's what the devil does to you
[1:07:13] when you begin to feel that breakthrough
[1:07:14] in the service it's going to fall apart
[1:07:16] so pull back that's a time to preach
[1:07:20] harder come on church that's a time to
[1:07:23] pull harder
[1:07:25] because we are not of those that draw
[1:07:29] back I'm going to tell you what a
[1:07:31] prophet said there's always difficulty
[1:07:33] in the way so if you're waiting for a
[1:07:36] service where there's no difficulty it's
[1:07:38] not going to
[1:07:40] happen Satan throws everything he can in
[1:07:43] the way when he sees a real move of God
[1:07:47] gets started he'll do it to you he'll
[1:07:50] put everything all the hindrances he can
[1:07:54] in your way now watch a prophet but we
[1:07:56] know that the word is a discerner right
[1:07:59] he said and we pray that you'll discern
[1:08:02] our hearts and reveal to us our causes
[1:08:06] that's hindering the great move of God
[1:08:08] in this last day so God is not going to
[1:08:11] let you come up to the barrier and then
[1:08:14] back up and say there's no way I can
[1:08:16] break it but the word is a deser oh God
[1:08:20] the word is a discerner of the thought
[1:08:23] and the intent have you ever been there
[1:08:25] have you ever been in a service and the
[1:08:27] word is coming forth and something in
[1:08:29] your heart is saying that's the truth
[1:08:32] that's the truth that's the truth and
[1:08:34] then the preacher says and it's for you
[1:08:37] and you want to raise your hands but
[1:08:39] then all of a sudden the little Spirit
[1:08:40] of condemnation comes over and hangs
[1:08:43] over you and says you cannot raise your
[1:08:45] hand you cannot say amen and then watch
[1:08:48] that preacher watch that preacher turn
[1:08:50] and say but Paul said there is therefore
[1:08:53] not now no condemnation to them that are
[1:08:57] in Christ
[1:08:59] Jesus do you see what just happened the
[1:09:02] word is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:09:05] intention so you were that close to
[1:09:07] Breaking the Barrier but some old devil
[1:09:09] of condemnation crawled up out of hell
[1:09:12] and hung over your life but because God
[1:09:15] is determined for you to get a
[1:09:17] breakthrough woo glory god is determined
[1:09:21] for you to get a breakthrough he will
[1:09:23] cause the anointed Ministry to rebuke
[1:09:26] that
[1:09:27] spirit and from there may go anointed
[1:09:30] ministers anointed men and women with
[1:09:33] such an inspiration on them of the
[1:09:35] loving Lord Jesus until there'll be a
[1:09:37] Revival breakout all the way across the
[1:09:43] continent God can use you to cause a
[1:09:47] Revival all across the continent now the
[1:09:50] move of God let me say this a move of
[1:09:52] God starts with God moving on his church
[1:09:56] coming into his church and proving he's
[1:09:59] the same yesterday today and forever you
[1:10:03] know what a move of God does can I I
[1:10:04] know this is simple but I pray it helps
[1:10:06] you you know what a move of God starts
[1:10:08] with it starts with people refusing to
[1:10:12] settle for less than what God promised
[1:10:16] them a move of God starts with a people
[1:10:20] who refuses to settle for less than what
[1:10:24] God promised them you know what a move
[1:10:26] of God is it's something out of the
[1:10:29] routine a move of God is Not ritualistic
[1:10:32] and neither is it traditional and a move
[1:10:35] of God is Not theological a move of God
[1:10:39] is the spirit of God finding a crevice
[1:10:43] in the heart of a Believer to lead him
[1:10:45] to the faith and the power and the
[1:10:48] promise and the manifestation now if you
[1:10:50] read the Bible you know in the Book of
[1:10:52] John the n9th chapter amen that there
[1:10:54] was a boy that was born blind right and
[1:10:57] the Bible says in verse 29 we know that
[1:11:00] God spake unto Moses but as for this
[1:11:02] fell we know not from when he is now
[1:11:05] watch this and the man answered and said
[1:11:08] un them why hearing is a marvelous thing
[1:11:11] that ye know not from whence he is and
[1:11:14] yet he hath opened mine
[1:11:17] eyes do you realize in that day I'm just
[1:11:20] preaching to you in that day the church
[1:11:22] was a cold old formal ritualistic LED
[1:11:26] Church by the ideas of the rabbis that
[1:11:29] someday Messiah will come someday God
[1:11:31] will do something someday there'll be a
[1:11:33] power amen someday he'll come and the
[1:11:36] sick will be healed the dead will be
[1:11:38] raised the blind eyes will be open the
[1:11:40] deaf ears will hear that's what was
[1:11:42] being taught in the synagogue but here's
[1:11:45] a young boy who had a crevice in his
[1:11:48] heart he had a crevice in his heart and
[1:11:51] he could feel the pressure of the
[1:11:54] rabbi's teaching he could feel the
[1:11:56] pressure of all the ideas about the
[1:11:58] Messiah amen but there was something in
[1:12:00] his heart amen that come in contact with
[1:12:03] faith amen and the faith led him to the
[1:12:06] power and the power led him to the
[1:12:08] promise and the promise was Jesus Christ
[1:12:12] the word made
[1:12:15] manifest in front of him are you hearing
[1:12:18] me now he's blind and all of a sudden
[1:12:21] something leaks into his heart something
[1:12:24] moves in his heart and the war and the
[1:12:27] Lord speaks to him and says here is your
[1:12:29] side rubs the the mud in his eyes and
[1:12:33] the boy com seeing right now watch this
[1:12:35] the blind boy looks at them leaders and
[1:12:38] says well you're the spiritual leaders
[1:12:39] of the nation and here comes a man and
[1:12:42] opens My Eyes by the power of God and
[1:12:45] yet you don't know nothing about him he
[1:12:47] said this is a marvelous thing he had
[1:12:50] something didn't he he sure did all
[1:12:52] right a man man could do this yet they
[1:12:55] did oh God yet they didn't know whence
[1:12:58] he
[1:12:59] was now watch a prophet the boy of John
[1:13:03] nine watch him tied to today and says
[1:13:06] now look today Brethren see we know we
[1:13:09] have a move of God we know we have a
[1:13:13] move of God we're not looking for a move
[1:13:16] of God we're not trying to fast a move
[1:13:18] of God we're not trying to pray up a
[1:13:20] move of God we have a move of of God he
[1:13:24] said and we know it's performing
[1:13:26] Miracles it's Healing The Sick it's even
[1:13:29] raising the dead it's casting out Devils
[1:13:32] it speaks with tongues and it interprets
[1:13:35] tongues it sends forth prophecies and
[1:13:37] they happen he showed a streams
[1:13:40] interpretation this isn't a strange
[1:13:42] thing that the great leaders would say
[1:13:45] we was a bunch of crazy people when
[1:13:47] they're the leaders of the nation the
[1:13:49] leaders of the church he said see it's a
[1:13:51] marvelous thing do y'all remember a few
[1:13:53] minutes to go when Faith meets the Power
[1:13:56] meets The Promise it'll bring a
[1:13:58] manifestation and that manifestation in
[1:14:01] somebody will blind somebody else amen
[1:14:04] it'll Open the Eyes of one and blind the
[1:14:07] eyes of the other oh God and here was a
[1:14:10] boy who had been blind since he was born
[1:14:13] but all of a sudden he received his
[1:14:15] sight and the Pharisees and the
[1:14:18] Sadducees they all said this is
[1:14:20] something Beyond we can comprehend amen
[1:14:22] but the same power that opened his eyes
[1:14:25] amen blinded the other's eyes you know
[1:14:28] why because a true move of God is
[1:14:32] scriptural a true move of God is
[1:14:35] scriptural I love what the Bible says
[1:14:38] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:14:41] think you have eternal life and they are
[1:14:44] they which testify of me he said let me
[1:14:47] give you scripture first with what we do
[1:14:49] it must be scriptural it's got to be
[1:14:52] scriptural God won't honor nothing else
[1:14:55] he don't honor lies he only honors his
[1:14:58] word but he promised that my word will
[1:15:01] not return to me void now watch this and
[1:15:04] we see the word that has been allotted
[1:15:06] today now watch this no matter how much
[1:15:09] unbelief rises in the camp God will
[1:15:13] honor his word when he finds Faith to
[1:15:16] honor it
[1:15:17] by are you hearing me no matter how much
[1:15:20] unbelief rises in the camp amen God will
[1:15:24] honor his word when he finds Faith to
[1:15:28] honor his word by then in other words
[1:15:31] that boy had a heart with the faith of
[1:15:34] God in it amen for the power of God and
[1:15:37] the promise of God to be manifested and
[1:15:39] God took a little blind boy oh God he
[1:15:43] took a little blind boy and honored his
[1:15:45] word in the face of religious educated
[1:15:49] people let me just say what the Bible
[1:15:51] said Jesus answering some them go your
[1:15:53] way and tell John what things you've
[1:15:55] seen and heard how the blind see is that
[1:15:58] scriptural how the lame walk is that
[1:16:00] scripture how the lepers are cleansed is
[1:16:03] that scripture how the deaf here
[1:16:05] scriptural how the dead are raised
[1:16:07] scriptural amen are you hearing me to
[1:16:09] the poor the gospel is preached
[1:16:12] scriptural a are you are you catching
[1:16:14] this Jesus done exactly what the
[1:16:18] scripture said he would do the Bible
[1:16:21] brother Bon said the eyes of the blind
[1:16:23] would be opened here's a boy that the
[1:16:26] eyes of his body had been open and
[1:16:29] here's an entire religious movement
[1:16:31] saying it's not so we don't know where
[1:16:33] he come from are you hearing me when the
[1:16:36] very Bible said when he come the blind
[1:16:38] would see and the lame men would leap
[1:16:40] like a heart they would ought they ought
[1:16:42] to have seen amen the word was
[1:16:45] manifested but here's where I want to
[1:16:47] preach to you for a few moments on but
[1:16:49] the boy knew it because he had been
[1:16:52] there
[1:16:54] the boy knew he had been there what did
[1:16:57] he do he was in action he was ready
[1:16:59] before his boss he was ready before the
[1:17:02] priest he was ready before the counsel
[1:17:04] he was ready for anything because he had
[1:17:07] recognized God and humbled himself and
[1:17:11] went into action with this testimony
[1:17:13] that's a real servant amen that boy saw
[1:17:17] the manifested word in action and he
[1:17:20] humbled himself and he received his son
[1:17:24] come on he received his side amen and he
[1:17:27] went into action and the prophet of God
[1:17:29] said and the pillar of fire ought to put
[1:17:31] us in action today as we've seen it
[1:17:34] Vindicated the words of his promise for
[1:17:36] this hour this last day it should put
[1:17:39] the whole move of God into action when
[1:17:43] you see the pillar of Fire come on
[1:17:46] church in John N it was God and flesh
[1:17:50] amen but today the God that was in the
[1:17:53] beginning was the god that got into
[1:17:55] Jesus is the god that's here
[1:17:58] today he's not here in a Corporal body
[1:18:02] but we have scientific evidence he is
[1:18:05] here in the form of the pit of fire
[1:18:07] listen church we are not following men
[1:18:11] we are not following churches we are not
[1:18:13] following Bishops We are following the
[1:18:16] scriptural Pillar of
[1:18:18] Fire we're following the scriptural
[1:18:21] Pillar of Fire in Exodus 13: 211 the
[1:18:25] Bible said the Lord went before them by
[1:18:26] day and what a pillar of cloud to lead
[1:18:29] them the way and by night and a pillar
[1:18:31] of fire Amen to give them light to go by
[1:18:34] day and night and he took not away the
[1:18:36] pillar of the cloud by day nor the
[1:18:38] pillar of Fire by night now watch this
[1:18:40] from before the people he took not away
[1:18:44] the pitter of cloud by
[1:18:46] day Pillar of Fire by night from before
[1:18:50] the
[1:18:51] people now it's Wednesday I don't have
[1:18:53] time to get into it very heavy but I've
[1:18:55] been studying on it you go read Ezekiel
[1:18:57] 1 compare Ezekiel 1 to Revelation 4 and
[1:19:00] here if not the prophet is clear that
[1:19:03] the Amish yellowish light is none other
[1:19:06] than the light of God right now watch
[1:19:09] this and he he very specifically over
[1:19:12] and over brother he points out the
[1:19:14] direction it's not backward it's
[1:19:17] forward are you hearing me now when he
[1:19:20] brought the children of Israel out of
[1:19:22] the wilderness he led them by a pillar
[1:19:24] of fire is that right the Bible said he
[1:19:27] did that was the anointing the Holy
[1:19:30] Spirit Christ that went before the
[1:19:32] children of Israel well if he's the same
[1:19:34] as he was then he's the same man the
[1:19:37] same person he's everything he was then
[1:19:40] he is now and as he led the church then
[1:19:43] in the natural he's leading the church
[1:19:46] today in the spiritual remember another
[1:19:49] place Israel come through many things
[1:19:51] but it was evening time when the token
[1:19:54] was required not in the morning not in
[1:19:56] the preparation the 14 days of the keep
[1:19:59] of the Lamb Israel know amen that
[1:20:01] something was coming amen all the
[1:20:03] preparation years was only a building
[1:20:06] for the promise something is coming come
[1:20:09] on Church the first pool something's
[1:20:12] coming the second pool something's
[1:20:14] coming but watch a prophet amen so did
[1:20:17] Luther know so did Wesley know so did
[1:20:19] finny know so did Knox and Calvin know
[1:20:22] but this is
[1:20:24] it they knew there would come a time
[1:20:28] that the pillar of fire would return
[1:20:30] back to the church they know there would
[1:20:32] come a time that these things would
[1:20:34] happen but they didn't live to see it
[1:20:37] but they look forward to it now watch
[1:20:39] the prophet the reformers look forward
[1:20:41] to it amen the seventh angel was not a
[1:20:45] reformer he was a prophet he was one to
[1:20:48] say we don't have to keep looking for
[1:20:51] something come on Church you got to

[1:22:09] right is he Healing The Sick is he
[1:22:12] saving the Lost is he revealing his word
[1:22:15] is he keeping his word is he manifesting
[1:22:18] his word is he doing what he said he
[1:22:21] would do then quit looking for the move
[1:22:23] of God and realize you are the move of
[1:22:27] God you are the move of God now the
[1:22:31] prophet said it very beautiful he said

[1:22:34] angel is supposed to wind up all the
[1:22:37] mystery all the mysteries of God are you
[1:22:40] ready for this the pillar of fire

[1:23:00] it we see the pillar of
[1:23:05] fire let me ask you this how do I see it
[1:23:09] do I literally right now see a ball of
[1:23:11] fire in this room I
[1:23:13] don't but I know it's here because I see
[1:23:17] the effect of its presence on the
[1:23:21] people are you hearing me I don't have
[1:23:24] to ask you come on it's like a boy go
[1:23:28] swimming you don't have to ask the boy
[1:23:29] if he's been swimming when he gets out
[1:23:30] of the pool his clothes are soaking wet
[1:23:34] listen I'm just a country boy from East
[1:23:36] Tennessee his clothes are soaking wet he
[1:23:39] can stand there and tell you Mama I
[1:23:40] ain't been swimming I ain't been
[1:23:42] swimming but the evidence is on him
[1:23:45] that's right that he's been in the water
[1:23:47] are you hearing me and some of y'all
[1:23:49] right now are saying oh I'm looking for
[1:23:50] the supernatural but I'm looking at the
[1:23:53] evidence that the Supernatural is on you
[1:23:57] are you hearing me it's Wednesday night
[1:23:59] and you're in the house of God with your
[1:24:01] hands raised with a Heart of
[1:24:03] Thanksgiving with a voice of Praise come
[1:24:06] on that's Supernatural you've lived
[1:24:08] another day in Satan's Eden and the
[1:24:10] devil did not squash your desire to be
[1:24:13] in the house of God listen friends quit
[1:24:15] looking for it and open up your eyes and
[1:24:19] see the same Pillar of Fire that led the
[1:24:22] children of Israel the same one that
[1:24:24] struck down Saul on this road to
[1:24:25] Damascus is the same one coming with the
[1:24:28] same power doing the same things
[1:24:31] revealing the same word staying word by
[1:24:34] word with the
[1:24:36] Bible now the pillar of fire is a
[1:24:40] changer can I tell you something else
[1:24:42] the pillar of fire is the Bible says in
[1:24:44] Exodus 14:19 and the angel of God which
[1:24:47] went before the camp of Israel removed
[1:24:50] and went behind them now watch and the
[1:24:53] pillar of cloud went from before their
[1:24:56] face and stood behind them now listen he
[1:25:00] did not go behind them to lead them
[1:25:03] backwards verse 20 and it came between
[1:25:07] the camp of the Egyptians and the camp
[1:25:10] of Israel it was a cloud and darkness to
[1:25:13] them but it gave light by night to these
[1:25:16] so that one oh my so that one came not
[1:25:21] near the other all the night
[1:25:22] can I tell you what the prophet said he
[1:25:24] said in Redemption by power 54 he said
[1:25:27] or went up from here went up from here
[1:25:29] and stood back here he said see a go
[1:25:32] between in the time of trouble Moses
[1:25:35] that night after leading Israel out that
[1:25:37] come Pharaoh's Army but the pillar of
[1:25:40] fire went down and hung between pharaoh
[1:25:43] and pursuing Army in Israel all right
[1:25:46] church can I preach it to you now here's
[1:25:48] Israel they're coming out of Egypt
[1:25:51] listen Egypt is not behind them or in
[1:25:53] front of them rather brother Bon Egypt
[1:25:56] is behind them but the enemy said I'm
[1:25:58] going to get
[1:26:00] you same enemy said he going to get you
[1:26:03] when God delivered you from the
[1:26:05] taskmasters of your previous life so the
[1:26:08] enemy said I'll get him so the prophet
[1:26:09] said but watch he said but the pillar of
[1:26:11] fire come down and made light to Israel
[1:26:15] and darkness to pharaoh and kept him
[1:26:18] apart see a goet oh I'm so glad today
[1:26:22] he is our goet are you hearing me so
[1:26:26] here's Egypt and all of a sudden brother
[1:26:28] one they can see Israel they're pursuing
[1:26:31] Israel but all of a sudden everything
[1:26:34] around them becomes dark and they cannot
[1:26:36] see Israel they cannot see where they're
[1:26:38] going they cannot see what path they're
[1:26:40] taking do you know why because Israel
[1:26:43] was in the middle of a move of God where
[1:26:46] God was moving from Egypt into the
[1:26:49] Promised
[1:26:51] Land and so God said I'll show you a
[1:26:53] bunch of devils you'll not get my people
[1:26:56] he went and stood behind them in other
[1:26:58] words Israel went on and the pillar of
[1:27:01] fire stood between
[1:27:03] Israel the pillar of fire stood between
[1:27:07] Israel and Egypt as a goet now watch a
[1:27:10] prophet he said and today in sickness
[1:27:13] between death and life he's my goet are
[1:27:16] you ready for this he takes one he takes
[1:27:19] death in one hand and life in the other
[1:27:23] one so here's Israel in this hand and
[1:27:27] here's Egypt in this hand and Egypt
[1:27:29] saying we're going to get Israel but
[1:27:31] they cannot outrun the hand of
[1:27:35] God in other words Egypt is pushing
[1:27:39] something and they don't realize what
[1:27:41] they're pushing because everything else
[1:27:44] they could move that's right oh God I
[1:27:47] got to quit everything else they can
[1:27:50] move but here's something they cannot
[1:27:53] move they cannot move it they're trying
[1:27:56] but they cannot move it you know what
[1:27:58] happened the poet Pro of God said God
[1:28:01] LED Israel to the Red Sea he said here
[1:28:03] come Egypt right there are you hearing
[1:28:05] me and Egypt got right there on the
[1:28:07] Hills amen of Israel and said we're
[1:28:09] going to get you this time amen but God
[1:28:12] rich in Mercy through the Angry Eyes
[1:28:14] looked at the pit of fire and the Sea
[1:28:16] got re got scared and rolled back and
[1:28:19] Israel crossed on dry ground
[1:28:24] are you hearing me and now for the first
[1:28:26] time Egypt says we're going to get him
[1:28:29] we're going to get him you know what
[1:28:30] Egypt said they said if Israel can make
[1:28:32] it so can we no you can because you're
[1:28:35] not of the same Covenant it was two
[1:28:37] different covenants God's covenant was
[1:28:40] on Israel that's why right now a bunch
[1:28:42] of devils are trying to destroy him amen
[1:28:44] but Israel's tearing down things left
[1:28:46] and right you know why because they're
[1:28:48] under a covenant well I'm here I might
[1:28:51] as well preach yall know it's the truth
[1:28:53] how many agree with me God backs Israel
[1:28:56] God stands with Israel let me just say
[1:28:58] this you know what's astounding to me is
[1:29:00] you got a bunch of murderers and liars
[1:29:02] and rapist and terrorists amen do all
[1:29:04] kinds of things and don't nobody say
[1:29:06] nothing but let somebody defend thems
[1:29:09] and every devil and Hell raises up and
[1:29:11] we literally got people marching around
[1:29:13] supporting a bunch of murders and
[1:29:16] rapist well come on you know I'm
[1:29:18] preaching the truth amen and all
[1:29:20] Israel's doing is defending their own
[1:29:22] property defending their god-given right
[1:29:24] do you realize that's the same devil
[1:29:26] right now but here's what I love about
[1:29:28] it I thought I read I got a news today
[1:29:30] on the plane brother brother ju you know
[1:29:32] what it said it said Israel has got one
[1:29:35] of hamas's lead terrorists amen trapped
[1:29:37] in a
[1:29:39] tunnel are you hearing me here's a group
[1:29:41] they've been trying to destroy Israel
[1:29:44] but now here's the Israel and got their
[1:29:46] leaders trapped in a tunnel listen them
[1:29:48] guys don't play fair they go underground
[1:29:51] but I love what what Benjamin nyaho said
[1:29:53] he said your tunnels won't stop us we'll
[1:29:56] blow them to Pieces we will not cease
[1:29:58] fire until we have got the victory I
[1:30:01] said oh God that same Devil's come
[1:30:04] around are you hearing me that same
[1:30:07] Devil's built tunnels in your life and
[1:30:09] when the word of God gets to go and
[1:30:11] forth and you're ready for that
[1:30:12] breakthrough that devil takes off
[1:30:14] running in a tunnel he built and tries
[1:30:16] to hide but we're preaching a bomb of
[1:30:20] Faith we're preaching a Faith bomb and
[1:30:23] we'll drop that bomb in the house of God
[1:30:25] and blow every devil out of the tunnels
[1:30:27] until the children of God recognize who
[1:30:30] they
[1:30:31] are where they come from and where
[1:30:34] they're
[1:30:35] going he come down as a go
[1:30:39] between he made light on this side for
[1:30:42] Israel Darkness for Pharaoh are you
[1:30:45] ready for this and the same angel of God
[1:30:49] is in the church tonight
[1:30:54] giving light for the church to walk on
[1:30:57] and darkness for those who will reject
[1:30:59] it we are the children of the light what
[1:31:04] are you saying preacher I'm saying the
[1:31:06] pillar of fire moves on brother God said
[1:31:10] the pillar of fire moves on every time
[1:31:11] the pillar of fire moved the church
[1:31:13] moved with it 1958 the pillar of fire
[1:31:15] moves on and God moves with it and
[1:31:18] somebody sees it and goes on 196 one
[1:31:22] God's either going to lead the church
[1:31:23] the Holy Ghost is going to lead it or
[1:31:24] man's going to lead it if you choose man
[1:31:26] go ahead God pulls his church right out
[1:31:28] and the pillar of fire moves on and the
[1:31:31] church moves with
[1:31:34] it let me say this in closing every move
[1:31:37] of God when God moves that move becomes
[1:31:41] a latter rain to the other move he said
[1:31:44] Luther was lat rain the cathic and John
[1:31:46] Wesley latter Reign the Luther Pentecost
[1:31:48] latter Reign denomination he said now
[1:31:50] the Pentecost was organized now what's
[1:31:52] going to happen see remember the
[1:31:53] children of God drove their steak down
[1:31:55] tent so tight but where they could pull
[1:31:57] up and when the fire moved the pillar of
[1:31:59] fire they moveed with it see they move
[1:32:01] with a pillar of fire but when you get
[1:32:03] the pillar of fire doing something the
[1:32:05] Holy Spirit doing something then after
[1:32:07] that man with a message departs his life
[1:32:09] then they say they organize upon his
[1:32:11] work watch and the pillar of fire moves
[1:32:13] right out leaves him sitting there just
[1:32:15] goes right on they're so stake down till
[1:32:18] they cannot move now watch a prophet
[1:32:21] Pentecost has become so Stak down until
[1:32:23] they died first organization was
[1:32:26] Catholic died out of there come the
[1:32:28] First Reformation Luther organized and
[1:32:29] died next come Wesley organized and died
[1:32:32] next come Pentecost organized and died
[1:32:34] now watch a prophetic announcement
[1:32:36] Pentecost has
[1:32:38] died God let it die invisible Union the
[1:32:42] shuck dried up to give forth strength to
[1:32:45] the seed but there must come something
[1:32:48] that cannot be organized and die and
[1:32:51] organiz ation spells death he says so
[1:32:53] with our great Pentecostal age we're
[1:32:55] living in there's got to come forth a
[1:32:56] word of God undenominational iner
[1:32:58] outside the Realms of that denomination
[1:33:00] outside from under denominational
[1:33:03] influence I'm just going to close on
[1:33:05] this point people say you know I
[1:33:07] actually said somebody tell me one time
[1:33:08] brother the one they said you message
[1:33:10] preachers y'all preach a lot of stuff
[1:33:12] but you really don't have a bunch of
[1:33:12] scripture for Everything You Preach you
[1:33:14] know and and I'm I'm sorry but I'm not
[1:33:17] very kind of the statements like that
[1:33:19] because this is a scriptural message so
[1:33:22] just the other day I took time to sit
[1:33:24] down and prove the scriptures that speak
[1:33:27] of the move of God in the last days I'm
[1:33:29] not even giving you all of them okay I'm
[1:33:31] just going to give you a few are you
[1:33:32] ready Joshua 1 Psalms 1 Psalm 27 Daniel
[1:33:36] 11 Daniel 12 Hosea 6 Joel 2 Amos 3 habac
[1:33:40] 2 Zechariah 4 Zechariah 14 Malachi 4
[1:33:44] Matthew 17 Mark 11 Mark 16 Luke 17 John
[1:33:48] 12 14 151 16 Acts 3 2 Corinthians Ians 3
[1:33:52] chapter 15 1 Corinthians 1 Colossians 1
[1:33:55] 1 Thessalonians 4 Hebrews 13 Revelation
[1:33:58] 13 5 8 10 13 17 18 19 20 21 22 all
[1:34:05] speaks of a scriptural move of God in
[1:34:08] the last days and the prophet says here
[1:34:10] I believe the scripture they thoroughly
[1:34:12] identifies the great move of God in the
[1:34:15] last days of the Holy Ghost to be Jesus
[1:34:19] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:34:22] forever I believe the scripture
[1:34:24] thoroughly identifies it I don't care
[1:34:26] what anyone else thinks about it we
[1:34:29] believe that to be the truth because
[1:34:31] it's thoroughly identified what are you
[1:34:34] saying brother Andrew I'm saying this
[1:34:36] the same Ministry is now identified in
[1:34:40] Christ is now identified in the bride
[1:34:42] moving the bride to the
[1:34:45] manifestation I love this he said now
[1:34:47] it's got to come right straight back to
[1:34:48] that original Ministry at on Earth
[1:34:49] because it's the bride they are one
[1:34:51] right now he promised in the last days
[1:34:54] how these things would happen and we see
[1:34:56] them happening like all the promises
[1:34:59] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 are you ready for
[1:35:02] this oh how many more Scriptures it
[1:35:06] would be
[1:35:07] endless there's endless scriptures
[1:35:10] pointing to you as the identified move
[1:35:14] of God in this age that's right brother
[1:35:16] Lan I don't think it's a coincidence
[1:35:18] brother B used the word endless because
[1:35:21] in Hebrews 7 speaks of mzc right and you
[1:35:24] know what he was he was after the order
[1:35:26] of the power of an endless life now
[1:35:29] watch MDC became Jesus Christ and MDC
[1:35:33] returns to the church in the last days
[1:35:37] to claim a body for a final move he said
[1:35:41] now when we see him return in these last
[1:35:43] days this great move of God moving
[1:35:46] across the nations of the world
[1:35:48] Gathering a people for the bride that is
[1:35:51] is the truth can I say it to you and I'm
[1:35:53] done this I'm going to say it to you
[1:35:54] like this some of you people that really
[1:35:57] believe this to be the truth we're
[1:35:58] entering another age we're entering the
[1:36:01] Rapture age you know the church cannot
[1:36:03] go in its condition it must get worse
[1:36:06] how many knows that it's got to get
[1:36:08] worse see it can't go like this he said
[1:36:10] and it's got to be something and it's
[1:36:13] moving right now friend it's it's it's
[1:36:16] on the move is on for the
[1:36:20] bride
[1:36:22] that's why the devil hates you is
[1:36:24] there's a people sitting here
[1:36:27] tonight under the order of

[1:37:55] already
[1:37:57] there the message only changed your
[1:38:02] scene the message changed your scene to
[1:38:06] see what was already there y'all
[1:38:09] remember Gaza and Elisha he came in
[1:38:13] there and he told Gesa or Elisha he said
[1:38:15] Elisha we're surrounded he said Gesa
[1:38:17] we're surrounded he said yeah we're
[1:38:19] surrounded he said well let's go out
[1:38:20] there he he said we're surrounded so he
[1:38:22] went out there and he looked and there
[1:38:23] was all the there was all the enemies
[1:38:24] and there was
[1:38:26] everything I've often I've often kind of
[1:38:28] thought maybe like this you know maybe
[1:38:30] Gaza was in there in the morning maybe
[1:38:31] he was drinking his morning coffee or
[1:38:33] something you know or Elisha rather he
[1:38:35] was in there maybe getting ready and
[1:38:36] just sitting there SI sipping on a cup
[1:38:38] of coffee or tea or whatever you know
[1:38:40] and then come running Gaz he said oh oh
[1:38:42] Elisha we're surrounded we're surrounded
[1:38:45] come out here and look you know and
[1:38:46] Elisha got up and maybe walked out there
[1:38:48] you know and he opened the door and he
[1:38:50] looked up and he
[1:38:51] said yeah yeah
[1:38:55] yeah went back in sit down you know Gesa
[1:38:59] came in there all tore up brother one he
[1:39:00] said Elisha Elisha didn't you see it he
[1:39:03] said oh yeah I seen
[1:39:05] it he said but there's more with
[1:39:10] us there's more with us than there is
[1:39:14] with him God open this boy's eyes and
[1:39:17] let him see there's more with us
[1:39:21] that's right there's more with us than
[1:39:24] there is with him Elisha by the word
[1:39:27] changed gesus see and he began to see
[1:39:30] beyond what he was
[1:39:33] seeing now come on church I can prove it
[1:39:35] to you by the Bible the Bible says we've
[1:39:38] come to Mount Zion right to the
[1:39:41] innumerable amount of
[1:39:44] angels come on Church you know what the
[1:39:47] prophet said he said like this he said
[1:39:49] out of the river of Euphrates has been
[1:39:51] released 200,000,000 demons against the
[1:39:55] bride brother one right here tonight we
[1:39:57] can count 200,000,000 demons that's been
[1:40:01] loosed against the bride out of the
[1:40:02] river Euphrates we can number the Devils
[1:40:06] against us brother Ariel we can number
[1:40:09] the Devils against us we can number the
[1:40:13] Devils against us but the Bible says
[1:40:15] we've come to Z where there's an
[1:40:18] innumerable amount of angels so in other
[1:40:21] words we can number the Devils against
[1:40:23] us but we cannot number the Angels
[1:40:26] that's for us hallelujah we can number
[1:40:30] the Devils against us but we cannot
[1:40:32] number the Angels that's with

[1:41:56] and Lord there the power of God could
[1:41:58] begin to leak into that heart it can
[1:42:01] begin to drop in that heart and Lord as
[1:42:04] the power of God drops in that heart sin

[1:44:07] Christ I feel the spirit of the Lord
[1:44:10] here tonight just leading my heart to
[1:44:11] this over and
[1:44:13] over when brother Bram talked about the
[1:44:16] barrier he called it a sound barrier and
[1:44:20] one place you say you got to break your
[1:44:22] own
[1:44:23] sound your own sound
[1:44:26] barrier see maybe the sound barrier for
[1:44:28] the
[1:44:29] church as a whole is different than your
[1:44:33] sound
[1:44:34] barrier maybe the church is breaking
[1:44:36] their sound barrier but your sound
[1:44:39] barrier is I've made too many mistakes I
[1:44:42] failed too many times I've come short
[1:44:45] too many
[1:44:46] times God's done with me I've send my
[1:44:49] day of Grace away
[1:44:51] but friends I believe here tonight in
[1:44:52] the house of God there's an anointing to
[1:44:55] break that
[1:44:57] barrier I believe there's an anointing
[1:44:59] in here tonight if you'll accept it word
[1:45:03] by word by word and let that word break
[1:45:06] out in your soul and bust every
[1:45:10] barrier quit confessing I'm going to the
[1:45:13] tribulation and start confessing I'm
[1:45:15] going in the
[1:45:16] Rapture quit confessing I'm defeated and

[1:45:22] Victorious quit confessing I'm not going
[1:45:24] to make it and start confessing I've
[1:45:27] already made it in the name of Jesus
[1:45:30] Christ in the name of Jesus Christ
