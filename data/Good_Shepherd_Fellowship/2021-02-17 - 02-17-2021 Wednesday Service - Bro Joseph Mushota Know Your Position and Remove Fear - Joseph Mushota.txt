i'll be really selfish bear with me okay i know you you read the bible you know the awakened fun description samuel chapter one oh where is it you know the story now there was a certain name of ramanath safin of mountain of ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elium the son of tao the son of zub and the aphra type and he had two wives the name of the one was hana and the name of the other peninnah and penina he had the children but hannah has no children and he's and this man went up out of his head and really to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord and the house office in shiloh and the two sons of hell of of me and the fines i don't know the priest of the lord with them and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to benina his wife to all sons to all sons and her daughters potions but unto hannah he gave a wealthy portion for he laughed hannah but the lord had shot half her home shall we pray father god we say thank you this evening father for your presence in our minds oh god the atmosphere it's right father we cast out the spirit of absent minded in our midst oh my reconquer we invite you father behind the poor peter god the preacher is you god the lord jesus christ people they came from a home from work father they come to hear not from man but to hear from thee they want to be blessed father from thee the blessing came from thee the power came from thee the untesting came from thee oh god that's why we invite you oh god put me aside of this behind of pulpit you take control father bless our soul bless our spirit bless our prayer for the answer the prayer for every each one of us this evening the one who can answer the prayer is to you the lord of the lord the lord of lord you are the king of kings there is none like your father you deserve glory you deserve honor this evening lord let us forget our problem because we are in the front of the solution father before the problem come you knew it father that's why you let it come in because you know how he's going out praise god thank you jesus father we can read god we can pray we can do what we can talk but if you don't come in our midst if you don't come in our way if you don't ask the father no one will help us that's why we ask this evening lord forgive our sins forgive our our shortcoming forgive our mistakes for the forgive father you know jesus said paul sometimes you want to do good things the wrong things come first that's why you always so father say father look at us through the blood of the lord jesus christ it's by your grace lord we didn't deserve it we didn't ask for it you have chosen us before the foundation of the world we just come to commemorate we just come for fellowship we want you god come in our heart this morning speak to us our father we don't have excuses of this aid of this generation father we have the bible we have the prophet in the camp we have the pillar fire in the camp where is god of the prophet we want to see you oh god come in our midst speak to us i give myself to thee i give the the seventh of god but i want i give all the service unto thee father just home the congregation speak to us oh lord thank you jesus because your presence is right here we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ we said amen maybe satan okay i'll just touch a little bit of our brother elkanah and our sister hannah so this couple was was very good now with the story you know very well where i want you to put attention is most of the time when something good want to come from god there is always like a trial that's where i want to go just for a few minutes before we pray god doesn't want to give that things you you don't feel that you you you went through it that's why when you asking something from god you ask and you you are thinking is going to give you in your way of thinking but god always bring another way to answer your prayer sometimes we miss the answer because we are expecting in our own ways grab the hand for the lord praise god amen wonderful god because the god of prophets the god of this bible the god of the entire message the bill of fire we have them is in our midst but what sometimes we feel like is not in our midst sometimes we feel like it doesn't answer our prayer sometimes we feel like what i did you start to check yourself maybe i did something wrong but my heart doesn't condemn me so i don't know what's going on the age we are living in a very dangerous age very dark age and a glorious age you know uh barbara always said where there is god the devil always be aside so sometimes you know i was uh in the question answer was asking if for 54 years asking like saying something said that he said sometimes you can think like you are in a darkness but god is just next to you why because god create let the darkness for you to appreciate the light you will never understand when somebody he doesn't have a fault and he said i'm hungry can you help me if you never go through that way you must also pass that way before you have a food you struggle you are sick then you can obey also when someone said i remember when i was hungry i know how hunger can make somebody to fail hello are you with me don't sleep on me please i don't like someone sleeping preaching i'm gonna just say hey man go to wake up praise god i'm not reading today i'm not reading too much we just say what it's around here so when you want to talk to god when you are asking god something you have to surrender i love that song i always think of my wife i surrender sometimes you just sing because it becomes like a habit i surrender glory be to god i may i sing that song before my heart because joseph doesn't have nothing to give to you i'm not a preacher i'm just an instrument god can use it's not a preacher is the instrument god can use that's why i don't like that spirit of compare preachers he's an evil spirit from hell you i can't preach like pastor pastor he can't preach like me forgot his own way when he masturbate i can't go there i'm gonna get lost i've got also my corner where i master you can you go there you leave me go alone all of us we take our preaching from god through the mouth of god and the mother of god is malachi 4 the power of this message is to know how to put the prophet at his place and to put the word at his place and you also your place the powerful of this message is not confusion is to know your place to know god's place to know the prophet this place one day they ask brother branham hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah praise god somebody said you are god christ and he said they are not far away from the truth why did he say hey you're wrong so stop stop no the message is just on the edge hallelujah it's just on the edge i always you know church don't have a fear of worshiping william marion branham you will never worship brahnam if you're a bride it's impossible because god put something in you for not worshiping brahmanam because if you put fear you are also stay away from the blessing of the prophet what are you fearing for there is some quotation they read you feel like hey he's like god some quotation he said am amen [Music] what is this yes i'm god because the age we are living is the age of you must become god you must raise up that it's not you know i love the way brother won't put it if you put but the branham and they put you also there because is the one one one person in the field they show you that that level it you can reach also that level if you don't see god in brother branham you can't also be god we are living in the age god speak to god glory be to god can you imagine brother branham said i saw the faithful but i'm checked don't say much about it it was in unknown language it's revealed is not revealed it's reverend and you are between area club for the lord is not your blood that is not your understanding you must drop down your god church that's where we have to go to higher this messages take you very high i always say this is politician the obamas they always say that they are babies as power we are more than them we are higher higher don't have any fear which is bring them they sit there they can't even if you do nothing they will never touch you if god doesn't allow them god is wonderful i love this message you know sometimes when i'm driving i'm sorry sometimes we speed like brother then i'm sorry we we confess all of us when pastor was saying hey i always she was telling me you offer brothers all of you must confess you you speed i can go just eight five you go there and you just i don't fear because if it's good i go to heaven babe i don't ready to die i know i didn't say you are going to die we just come out from the body is not good i'm bringing i'm breaking the law it's not good it doesn't simply mean that i don't ever i don't fear death you know why to make you to fear death it's because you are not to show where you are going that that that's the meaning you know death it is a bridge i always tell my wife i said the one who comes in my life make me a desire to live for a little longer is you he's there i always tell her why you were telling me that yeah most of the time i was just feeling like come out of him this bird sometimes in me i just go you just when you are start to come closer to god there is nothing nothing good upon the earth nothing good i'm telling you guys what is cars houses when i was there people in africa said everyone in the united states they've got the cars everyone united states have got houses everyone what what prosperity can i preach to you you to every spirit everyone's got houses both cars they have good food so tell me what do you want if everyone wants to travel to africa now but rather went to africa i can make in africa someone want to travel it's elected lecturers [Music] it's depend you see it's it's a different way so it's at the level that's why they told brother about uh about general jackson is he's my friend but them if they believe speaking tangles the evidence of the holy spirit it's okay it's okay with gina jackson it's perfect you see the attitude it is wrong it's perfect with who genu but is not perfect with brother why are you fighting this message is a higher understanding you must someone is talking to you you just look at me him you know he's level you just walk away you love him that's it it's not a problem about fasting discussing only things i want to emphasizing don't ever fear of worshiping with that fear is going in assemblies all over the world people they fear to worship because a lot of people they are worshiping brahmanam today a lot of people some of you will see them here pastor we can he won't know gonna just put somewhere here and they start to preach stuff give trouble to man of god and start to adjust but like me i'll just i just smile i know he's level because those people also they must be there to worship abraham to prove this message is the truth you can't stop it but the problem i'm preaching to the bride this evening yeah i'm preaching to the brother the bride they must remove fear because without malachi 4 we won't be here like this you have to know that we came from denomination because of malachi 4. and the malachi 4 is william marion branham why with people they say paul there's no problem paul said matthew said when we mentioned brahm no don't mention it too much here no brahmana what's going on bride what's going on what's going on that's why the jets become cold can you imagine a baby said if you don't have a faith tell god the border the man you send upon the earth has prayed for you though those rewards are going to get it then sometimes you just god i know you sent someone for this age he had pray for me help me yeah i'm healed this age is a glorious age and the the revival of the churches it's over it's it's but we have to revive the bride the bride is individual revival it's not a collection devi revival it's individual revival you feel like you you just want to scream you want us to dance you want to praise the individual is not group praise god praise god praise god praise god because the message we receive is a powerful message it's not a message where somebody breaks is god as the president said i believe is the angel christian message amen praise god angel christopher is god himself when is it for the his children he come himself the great angel so now the the time we are leaving is the same way the bride they must get ready for the rapture we must get rid of rapture and when we are praying what are you praying for what what is your prayer you still praying for i don't know i'm sorry i prayed for just for short time for my wife i wasn't praying praying no no no i was just confessing she's coming my my beautiful my queen that is my queen i'm the king he's coming i'm going to get married i never fast and pray it's okay for doing that i didn't say it's wrong the thing is the secret is god must see him in what you are doing associate god in your business is a jealous god he doesn't want to see a selfish a tight you still have a problem that only died for the babies if you're not paying that i just feel for you sorry you know how where where you put yourself under case so no one will put you out of that question because those are the principle god put upon the earth a principle can you imagine bill gate he came to south africa in devon they ask a question what is the secret to you to have disabilities he said where i got started my secret is a tight bill gate maybe you think like you're more spiritual more than bill gates right because you don't know in this world they are you don't know he said the secret those are the principle god put upon the yet and if you read that scripture very well let us read i don't know how i'm going there let us read my card from malachite where i'm going okay let us go there okay we are going somewhere cleveland for the lord amen amen please god amen amen amen i want us to pray i just want to take you for prayer malachi 3 this can certain this eight i think this is eight and nine are you there i'd like for you to read with me will a manner of god yet you have robbed me but you say we're in a europe d in tithe and offering you are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this all nations there is two categories of people in that scripture you he's you that one is close you he's children and all people are being died even if they are not going to church they know the secret for the for the principle it's not even a blessing that's why i mean man i don't call it blessing many i call it assistance material i call it blessing the blessing is the holy spirit it doesn't mean that you have a man you are blessed no you have a house with aeroplane no the blessing the holy spirit keeps you to love the word of god the blessing the holy spirit to keep you to love more god to work for him to work for his children to do what god wants you to do that's the blessing that's the prayer this malachi 4 and the revelation of seven cells it's a powerful powerful one that's why pastor was pretty said it's revealed for the age but you needed individual revelation that's where we are now that's why we come to church and what about said you're gonna receive revelation reading and prayer reading and praying until he didn't say ask ask pastor i he one year i never asked him one question is that he preached i understand when i don't understand i kneel down i understand i move on this is a borrow with language english it's not our mother language we can express everything but when we are saying something try to understand what you want to say and what they want to say is not yourself it's not your brain and what you want to say is the holy spirit will help you what you want to say hello here clapton for the lord this bible is it is it's become a new bible because of malachi 4. everyone is reading the bible they don't understand but you and i it's become a new bible we can say separate seed is here because of malachi 4. is our salvation he brought jesus our life in our midst we are not pentecostal denomination we are a bride this evening when we are praying i want to know we are praying for what what are you praying for since this chain of prayer what is your prayer and in your prayer we have to put god what do you take god to do for you staff money marriage it's okay but the error it's okay pray for marriage praise the lord don't follow me don't mind me that's that's that's you can pray but more important is when god is pleased he stand he took preacher with you hallelujah praise god when god is pleased before you start to pray he answered your prayer he asked a solomon what do you want he didn't ask us something he said god gave me wisdom to lead your people that's where prayer must be conducted when god which kind of prayer which kind of requests my people not his people giving wisdom and the money was very rich he didn't ask for money i'm guiding you for the good attitude for prayer i'm guiding you to put everyone at his position i'm guiding you to stay at your position please stay put the prophetess position a pastor everyone its position and respect i respect a lot of men of god not his brother one because of the office that's the only way i can ever benefit from god through him you don't know what i don't know if you understand it's not about age it can be younger more than me but the office need to get a blessing i must respect that office is there humanik can you have a mistake but the office praise the lord clapton for the lord praise god hallelujah bride they must get ready let us remove those trashes let us remove the the the i don't know the date the tones and the things that let us clean ourselves to clean ourselves is what to know your position and the remove fear remove fear you will never worship brannam if you feel like you're worshiping your place is here i'm going to tell you something one day brother abraham was working walking one brother just feel loved and hold on like this but just detect see that this is a genuine another brother was coming behind ah that brother hold baby like this i can do the same thing when he was coming but the one didn't look at him he received the revelation brother don't do that what you are thinking to do is wrong that's the message of the hour some action this one can do it is right some action this one can do it is wrong now when you put your own understanding how are going to judge it you're gonna judge wrong we're gonna get in trouble that's why marriage marriage always advice preachers when marriage issue in the church leave it to the pastor that's the case very difficult to treat in the churches leave it he must pray and do what god lead him to do we're going to respond to him god and those people it's not your own business it's a very very complicated case jesus met it permitted moses did ask who they are going to to succeed no marriage is is is a case that's why i said those are the case because there is a spiritual marriage and physical marriage is a type some people you can say this one can't be a bride but god so he's a bride this behavior okay how can you explain to me peter and the judas a problem guy they want to wash his feet hold the body watch me jesus problem they want to arrest jesus [Music] you've got the seed of god but when you see peter in this one you can't even if you pastor this and that's god saw him he put him a pastor hallelujah he never even know how to write his name that's what brown said don't lean in your own understanding church leaning over the word of god this message is about you to drop down your guards we we don't know nothing especially always said we don't know nothing we don't the one who knows the holy spirit the attitude toward the word of god when they present don't defend kneel down say god the sorry the attitude sometimes babaram said you you can i can you can say oh that one that's the holy spirit this one devil spirit you're judging judging it's okay but he said if i take the bible if i ask who have the holy spirit in the church 90 percent they can resign but if i can just read the bible how the bible said they're gonna start they can't sleep they start groaning because of the abomination of the world if i start to put that one i wanna ask the same question i'm gonna have two hands and he said you are hurting your church you say you are you are you are this you just preach to remove the childish in them remove the babies in them he said i'm not a judge i just preach the word so sometimes we judge wrong i was telling my wife i said you know what we when we can talk together you know you can think that brother or that sister the way behavior ever said i'm a more spiritual than him or her but when we ask god god gave him a big crown i gave you a small crown are going to fight of god are going to fight with god we've got that attitude in the message message believer they saw that they are more spiritual than pentecostal but it's not about spiritually it's about where you stand however you act when there is a problem how you handle the problem that's maturity it's not about biting talking and gossiping and destroying and and and better destroy that is not a pride everybody you see that one and you you know me i'm very strict my wife knows even if the area they knows when we are praying they know me very well i don't play we will read the word of god sometimes i stop if you play again i'm putting this in the room i close the door sometimes you hear a grump i say uncle he's like a deacon yes i don't play when we reach god business let us be serious we can play we can do other but when we go to business why we can go early to chair to to work whatever but when is the church i feel like i don't want to do it i feel like i will feel like and tomorrow monday feel like not to go to work stay home why change you always i don't feel like you think like this body gonna let you easily reach the church this body is full of nonsense until you see this body is full of nonsense you start to be a christian enemy is not my brother enemy is not my sister my name is myself i'm fighting day and night to be right paul said i want to do right bad things come this is mind corrupted the mind the other things that's why this blood this spirit can't even speaking language you have to feel like you don't know nothing and expect god to do something you can miss a blessing from the small child you're expecting brother dan brother jonathan to come and give you a answer the answer is with the small boy come to you and answer you the solution is there you are missing you because you underestimate the people you think you are better than the people you are not my sister you are not my brother let us stand in our position let us sustain let us stand in opposite you are the bride of the lord jesus christ i just encouraging you let us let us have an attitude any preacher behind here is preaching to me don't have an attitude this is a preacher for this new this is joseph this is saying you always take preaching you put in the people what what is your place if you are perfect stay home why are you coming here clap the hand for the lord praise god let me just read one quote today just um exhortation but it's okay are you okay are you mad on me i just be late hallelujah do you love the lord clap then for the lord amen amen i love you so much now you have to know my office is to always put this church on my prayer always when i kneel down i pray for the man of god because he's not easy myself i've been running to be a pastor i never like to be a pastor i don't know the future of god i don't like i know how it takes to be a pastor it can if 100 dollar in his pocket is sacrifice he gives to you but his family doesn't have a food that's that's that's in here all pasta doing that the same him timothy i know i saw it pasta cheese are same i mean i always be among pastors i saw this struggled but you people you can't know and they must be led you can have hundred you ask him he said okay i see but someone came after you and he gave him and you can say why he gave him he didn't give me he was laid to give to him before he gave you all those things you don't expect to teach to you you must be i have ability to understand clap the hand for the lord because the wrong attitude it can make you to be cold it can start to chase our people from you or us we must be the salt you must be able to to create peace at work where there is a trouble and stress i'm working there in factory in general when i just there is a stress some people they don't like you either they hate you i love them [Music] and i always go to those they don't love me i want to make sure i love them and i want to do good things to them when they're in trouble i'm the first to help do you need help i just want to have to start this but a short of them i can help see ya i can let us go let's you just did i can go trip straight you just sit there you look at me yes i just want to do that that's the only way you have to to train yourself don't don't wait anything to be easier things are not easy in christianity never be easy never be easy that's why we come to this to the service to to put some power and destruction it's not here we we are going to manifest the word out there that's why the devil is wearing for us that's where you have to measure your christianity is out there when they start to speak about wrong about jesus or whatever you did you don't want to say anything coward show your position that's why i love trump myself because whatever they are doing but at least he can say about jesus give testimony about christianity my lord jesus at least others they don't mention him they can start until they finish they never mention jesus in their mouth yeah because you know the age we are living people they are ashamed to be called christians when the people are doing nonsense they can do nonsense on the street they are they are wearing half scared things in this cold sometimes you see someone it doesn't feel cold no spirit is under spirit but it's half scared like me i'm covering i'm okay but anointing spirit of the evil can you imagine that how strong it is so those spirits are very dangerous so when you among people take your stand show the people where you stand tell you're a christian media i told them i'm a christian only if they schedule this schedule is complicated until god will yeah but i will tell them i'm a christian i like to go to church sunday oh let us see this we're going to start this is fun the time will come i'll take another shift so they have to know i showed them i'm a christian i wasn't my wife i wanted to manage again i'm a christian i'm a preacher i want to do the work of god oh sorry yes she's there i was telling them tell them they have to know whatever because they will never chase you until god allow i'm telling you we are just scared for nothing they will never do nothing to you because i said that this job it's got the gift to me no one can put me out no one i'm dead they're gonna come and millions who have left them dead yourself until god said come out and a little bit clap the hand for the lord praise god amen amen amen this is prayer time and i want to know why are praying for i'm just guiding breath more than to be more than closer to god that's that's more important the staff will come after i'm telling you how's his wife's children after but be more closer to him and when you're closer to him he's gonna direct you you're gonna start to hear that small voice you're gonna let you don't feel don't see yourself you're more spiritual than others that thing is a king message believe i saw it around the world i'm a missionary africa i saw people people they are so bright in the lord they don't know that's the worst things is the message believers people they are proud they don't know what you can you see this pastor is proud he doesn't know i said god sorry i don't wanna be that way i need the holy spirit we knee down on the road on the on or outside this is crazy i'm crazy for the lord whose grace are you all those i'm doing for this body knows to feel is nothing dust this is dust nothing but you receive a higher message this message you can't muhammad this message you you can't you you can't be crying this message whatever happened say god allowed to come to come it's going away there is no eternal suffering there is nothing things comes it goes comes it just goes coming to go what i'm encouraging today we are going somewhere

it's not the building it's lord it's not the location it's it's not anything we have done the lord for if there's any part of it that was our involvement then surely it would fail but lord you've you've been in it all lord from the location you're the one who chose it the people father you knew who would be here yes lord the minister father you knew who exactly you would speak through even the needs of the people father lord as they came to this service needing something from you you knew each and every need lord only thing we had to do was set ourselves to the side lord not just the minister not just the song leader not just the pastor not just the musicians or the church leadership or lord but each and every one father that those who needed something from you also just needed to come and set themselves to the side set aside their fears set aside their anxiety set aside their hopelessness father and just raise up with faith father lord and even that is from you you said it's a faith in in the son of god and that is your own faith that you gave each into each and every one of us we've got to reach up and lord many times we say we've got to reach up and grab a hold of it but lord that's not even completely true either [Music] because it doesn't matter how high we reach if you're not reaching back down it won't matter but lord we just bow our heads in humility realizing the greatest revelation of all always you reach down your hand for us father you're the one who took a hold of us the whole way through it wasn't anything that we did it was just you begin to open our eyes to what you were doing lord that's all we ask this evening lord just open our eyes a little bit more to see you to see you in your glory to see you in your creation to see you in our lives to see you in the lives of the people around us father see you in this little church see you in your bride father to see what you're doing lord that would just give us such a humbleness of spirit such a grace for those around us lord that we be able to do the same for those around us and as you've reached down for us we can reach down for those around us and share a little grace and share a little love thank you lord jesus asks you go with your people father this evening father as we'd leave this building we'd not leave your presence your presence would go with us with each and every one or may you keep them safe on the roads those who are unable to make it lord may your presence be there with them in their homes and or their places of work father wherever they're at they may they just feed you come on by lord that lord you're not constrained by the walls of a building you said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name father and that's not just a building but you said the father desires that he would worship him in spirit and in truth lord so if they've joined us in spirit and in truth and they are amongst us and we know your presence is with them we surrender all these things into your hands in jesus most wonderful and precious yes give [Music] oh you can hide all this work [Music] oh i meet jesus in my life you can find [Music] he gave me jesus oh yeah give

be feared to be afraid amen i mean the only reason you have to be afraid is when you don't have the holy ghost i mean you have to be even afraid of yourself you know you have to be afraid of yourself if you don't have the holy ghost because you don't you really don't know what you would do the next meeting you know but uh with the lord in our midst and his grace that has brought us this far we have no reason to be afraid praise the lord and you know uh and i really appreciate that you know i mean just like he said if uh if christ has captured our heart you know that's to think about love that's the thing about marriage [Music] marriage is uh is a spiritual it's a supernatural thing that have cut your heart of an individual if christ has caught our heart and has brought us into this invisible union that we are in there is not a space for another man amen there is not a space for another man you cannot put a pastor there you cannot put the prophet there there is nobody you can put there because christ has taken a hold of our heart amen you know so and moses told the children of israel he says somewhere in deuteronomy chapter 13 he says you know sometimes the lord god just like our brother said well we allowed a man to preach something or allow a man to say something it is not that man moses said the lord your god is trying to prove you he's trying to prove you that after all that he have done for us are we going to leave him to go after fairy tale or go after another person praise the lord amen so uh after the trial come the blessing amen we know that's exactly what
