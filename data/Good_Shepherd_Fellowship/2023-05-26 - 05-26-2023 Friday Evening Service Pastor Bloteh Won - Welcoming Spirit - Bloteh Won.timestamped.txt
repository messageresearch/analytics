[59:15] of the law they don't have to do surgery
[59:17] and so she wanted to live for them in
[59:21] the hands of the Lord she also told me
[59:24] the testimony of one of her aunt
[59:29] that was
[59:31] diagnosed with first stage four cancer
[59:35] and
[59:37] the situation was so terrible
[59:41] that even the husband
[59:44] of the lady he resolved to taking her
[59:48] grave
[59:49] and and to just wait for her to die
[59:54] but uh
[59:57] sister brother told him not to do that
[1:00:01] you don't want to
[1:00:03] bury your wife before she died
[1:00:06] so the
[1:00:09] excited to waiting and
[1:00:12] take her to the hospital
[1:00:15] but with prayers and our sister was
[1:00:18] waiting on the Lord and crying to God
[1:00:21] she told me and she remember the case of
[1:00:26] uh
[1:00:30] his sister from
[1:00:34] South Africa that brought a Brandon pray
[1:00:37] for and she was thinking about that and
[1:00:40] and just asking God to Florence
[1:00:43] Nightingale and uh and then the lady
[1:00:47] also that is that is with the stage four
[1:00:50] cancer she's also Flores
[1:00:53] so she was just reminding God of his
[1:00:56] promises and reminding god of what he
[1:00:58] did and he's able to do
[1:01:00] and uh and God in his Mercy was able to
[1:01:04] come down because uh the setting point
[1:01:06] the lady was in Coleman she was now
[1:01:09] speaking but the Lord brought her out
[1:01:12] and she's out of Coleman she's able to
[1:01:15] eat
[1:01:16] and even the doctor is preparing to send
[1:01:19] her home
[1:01:20] so our sister is believing God for the
[1:01:23] uh for Recovery she trusting God that
[1:01:27] God will grant the ant
[1:01:30] even the salvation of her soul
[1:01:33] so we we want to bring those needs
[1:01:35] before the law tonight
[1:01:37] and uh
[1:01:38] we want to be also thankful and we want
[1:01:42] to thank the Lord for giving us another
[1:01:45] opportunity to be in the house of the
[1:01:47] Lord and pray that God would just pour
[1:01:50] His blessings upon us the sibling and he
[1:01:55] will bless us in his presence and he
[1:01:59] will be uh
[1:02:01] be with us this weekend we want to
[1:02:04] commit the services to the Lord that the
[1:02:07] Lord will just take complete control and
[1:02:10] uh
[1:02:12] come down and bring his word to our
[1:02:15] hearts just give us a spirit of worship
[1:02:18] a spirit of fellowship and we just want
[1:02:22] to place all of those things in the
[1:02:24] hands of The Lord At the beginning of
[1:02:26] this week I had to I had to travel down
[1:02:29] uh to go and see brother Bill Young's
[1:02:32] and now a good old friend of mine and
[1:02:35] he's now been well and he's still
[1:02:38] trusting the Lord that God will be able
[1:02:40] to bring him out
[1:02:41] he has loose balance in his left leg and
[1:02:45] so he had to sit and preaching and and
[1:02:49] need a lot of help
[1:02:51] to go in and out of the house and all
[1:02:54] the things that he have to do but there
[1:02:57] was a young lady in their church
[1:02:59] after their prayer meeting last Monday
[1:03:03] as a family went to sleep they woke up
[1:03:07] in the morning and she has passed his
[1:03:09] life so they had to do her funeral early
[1:03:14] this week Monday night was the wake I
[1:03:17] got there writer at the end of the week
[1:03:20] but I had to help but build at a great
[1:03:23] site on Tuesday and then I had a service
[1:03:26] for them on Wednesday and flew back
[1:03:29] and uh so we want to just leave uh
[1:03:32] brother Bill Young's in the hands of the
[1:03:34] Lord tonight that the Lord will just uh
[1:03:37] be gracious to his servant the Lord will
[1:03:41] touch our brother
[1:03:43] the Lord will heal him
[1:03:45] yeah he has a church that is that is
[1:03:48] fully
[1:03:51] relying on him as every church will look
[1:03:54] to their pastor
[1:03:56] and what he have to sit and pray she
[1:03:59] have to say it in these songs even
[1:04:01] Wednesday night before I came up to
[1:04:03] preaching and now we just want to pray
[1:04:06] that God will just be merciful in the
[1:04:09] Lord will just help his servant he will
[1:04:11] bless the people and we just want to

[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:01] I want to talk on something a little bit
[1:33:04] that I entitled to now welcome in spirit
[1:33:06] so you can see why I'm thinking
[1:33:08] welcoming voice
[1:33:10] so uh I was just I was thinking on this
[1:33:13] uh earlier this week I was actually
[1:33:16] meditating on the thought
[1:33:19] and uh if I if I can be able to get back
[1:33:23] into uh that China and I can tell you
[1:33:26] what I was thinking on it but let's read
[1:33:29] uh
[1:33:31] Matthew chapter 8.
[1:33:34] now we're going to look at two
[1:33:37] structured in the in the in the Bible
[1:33:40] tonight
[1:33:42] they are dead with uh
[1:33:45] uh the two times that Jesus
[1:33:50] actually use the word great faith
[1:33:55] it was to uh
[1:33:58] the Roman Centurion
[1:34:00] and also to the seraphinican woman
[1:34:04] those were the two times in the
[1:34:06] scripture that Jesus used the word great
[1:34:10] faith
[1:34:11] he says I'm not seeing great fear I'm
[1:34:13] not seeing such a faith in Israel
[1:34:15] he said to the woman woman great is that
[1:34:18] faith
[1:34:20] uh let's let's read Matthew chapter
[1:34:25] 15 let's read 15. that is the
[1:34:28] seraphinican woman Matthew chapter 8 is
[1:34:30] a Roman Centurion but let's read uh
[1:34:33] chapter 15.
[1:34:40] but tonight I'm not I I won't make I
[1:34:43] won't major on the great faith what I
[1:34:45] want to Major
[1:34:46] on tonight is the attitude
[1:34:50] the that that these
[1:34:53] sisters have that these ladies have
[1:34:56] all these character have because uh this
[1:34:59] one lady and one man
[1:35:03] so Matthew chapter 15 let's just read a
[1:35:05] little bit yeah
[1:35:08] and then we will have you to have your
[1:35:10] seed
[1:35:16] praise the Lord
[1:35:23] Matthew chapter 15 let's read from verse
[1:35:25] 21
[1:35:31] Matthew chapter 15 we'll read from verse
[1:35:34] 21 then Jesus
[1:35:36] went hence and departed into the course
[1:35:38] of tide and see them and behold a woman
[1:35:42] of Cana came out of the same course and
[1:35:45] Cried unto him saying have mercy on me
[1:35:50] O Lord thou son of David my daughter is
[1:35:53] grievously this with the Devil
[1:35:57] but he answered her not a word
[1:36:04] and his disciple came and and he saw him
[1:36:07] saying
[1:36:09] send her away
[1:36:11] for she cry after us
[1:36:15] but he answered and said I am now sent
[1:36:18] but to the lost sheep of the House of
[1:36:20] Israel
[1:36:22] then came she
[1:36:25] and worship him
[1:36:28] praise the Lord
[1:36:30] that's that's a powerful verse there's
[1:36:32] if we can if we can choose a memory
[1:36:35] verse tonight
[1:36:37] we can we can we can choose to remember
[1:36:39] that we can choose that as our memory
[1:36:42] verse
[1:36:43] then came she and worship him
[1:36:46] saying Lord
[1:36:49] help me
[1:36:51] praise the Lord
[1:36:53] then came she and worshiped him saying
[1:36:56] Lord help me
[1:36:58] but he answered and said it is not me to
[1:37:02] take
[1:37:03] the children's bread
[1:37:05] and to cast it to dogs
[1:37:10] and and she said true Lord yet the dogs
[1:37:14] eat of the crumbs
[1:37:16] which fall from the Masters table
[1:37:21] then Jesus answered
[1:37:23] and said unto hard o woman
[1:37:26] great is thy faith
[1:37:30] be it unto thee even
[1:37:33] as thou will
[1:37:36] and her daughter was May hold from the
[1:37:39] very hour
[1:37:40] let's pray together father
[1:37:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:37:45] humbly come to you tonight
[1:37:48] we never
[1:37:50] Channel our mind to preach tonight Lord
[1:37:52] but like your Prophet said the service
[1:37:55] the Gathering of your people is not
[1:37:58] completed without your word
[1:38:00] so Lord we just want to take a talk to
[1:38:02] encourage ourselves as our our visitors
[1:38:06] will be coming in this evening again we
[1:38:09] pray that father you will grant them a
[1:38:11] safe travel and we want to trust you for
[1:38:14] the services tomorrow bring us together
[1:38:16] and prepare our heart's law we can come
[1:38:20] on the expectation we can come further
[1:38:24] supporting the gift of God that we
[1:38:26] preach to us tomorrow coming with no
[1:38:29] Reserve Lord father only to hear from
[1:38:31] you so bless us this evening in Jesus
[1:38:34] name amen the Lord bless you you may
[1:38:37] have your seed
[1:38:39] like I said I want to talk on uh the two
[1:38:42] times the the the the odd time the first
[1:38:45] time the Bible mentioned that is in Lu
[1:38:48] in Matthew chapter 8 this was when the
[1:38:51] the Centurion went to Jesus and uh
[1:38:54] George happy birthday
[1:38:56] and we pray that the Lord will bless you
[1:38:58] amen
[1:39:00] and uh uh
[1:39:04] he went to Jesus and was asking Jesus
[1:39:07] for one of his seven that was now well
[1:39:11] if Jesus would come and heal his servant
[1:39:15] but he actually asked Jesus to just
[1:39:18] speak the word
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:22] and he said I'm a man of authority
[1:39:26] I know what it is I tell one goal and he
[1:39:29] go I tell this one come and he come
[1:39:33] praise the Lord if thou would just speak
[1:39:36] the word my servant will be healed
[1:39:39] Jesus said I have not seen such a faith
[1:39:43] I have not seen such a faith in Israel
[1:39:47] and the Bible says by our very same hour
[1:39:51] he servant was healed
[1:39:53] praise the Lord
[1:39:55] just like the Bible also testify here
[1:39:57] when Jesus said to this woman or woman
[1:40:01] great is that Faith the Bible says and
[1:40:04] her daughter was made hold from their
[1:40:07] very hour
[1:40:09] praise the Lord
[1:40:10] now so what I want to talk talk on here
[1:40:13] tonight if the Lord will be able to help
[1:40:16] us as he has always been good to us I
[1:40:21] want us to look at
[1:40:22] uh something that is that is uh that
[1:40:26] comes common if you are if you are uh
[1:40:30] someone that is interested in listening
[1:40:32] to the prayer line uh during during uh
[1:40:36] uh the meetings of brother Brandon there
[1:40:38] is something that was always common
[1:40:41] and it was this statement that you have
[1:40:45] a welcoming spirit
[1:40:49] praise the Lord
[1:40:52] you see faith
[1:40:54] okay
[1:40:57] glory be to God I'm almost scaring
[1:41:00] myself
[1:41:03] but that's fine
[1:41:05] now so you see faith
[1:41:10] we look at uh
[1:41:15] when you look at this scripture
[1:41:23] there are a lot of things
[1:41:25] that
[1:41:26] Faith rests on brother Brandon make us
[1:41:29] to know their faith have fun is resting
[1:41:31] place on the promised word of God
[1:41:34] amen
[1:41:36] a fine is Faith on the on is resting
[1:41:40] place on the promised word of God
[1:41:42] but what I want us to realize and and
[1:41:46] look at tonight
[1:41:47] like I said it's it's the atmosphere the
[1:41:50] attitude
[1:41:52] the attitude
[1:41:54] that Jesus saw
[1:41:58] that he identified
[1:42:01] and what he called great faith
[1:42:05] praise the Lord now you have to realize
[1:42:09] that this woman was not she was not
[1:42:12] rebuking demons
[1:42:14] she was not saying Lord I believe you
[1:42:17] can heal my seven uh or my daughter and
[1:42:20] I rebuke that devil and no
[1:42:23] she had an attitude
[1:42:27] she had an attitude
[1:42:32] I mean we you can you can you can
[1:42:34] believe God's word you can find the
[1:42:37] scripture you can line up the courts
[1:42:40] but if those things are not back up with
[1:42:44] the right attitude
[1:42:47] Brad Brown was says the right mental
[1:42:49] attitude
[1:42:52] praise the Lord
[1:42:55] amen if it is not back or wave the right
[1:42:59] attitude
[1:43:01] you'll realize that uh
[1:43:04] uh
[1:43:06] you'll be will be believing God because
[1:43:08] many of the time especially in the dead
[1:43:11] and age that we are living in
[1:43:13] one of the thing that is killing people
[1:43:15] in this age is the spirit of entitlement
[1:43:20] praise the Lord the spirit of
[1:43:22] entitlement we we find that you know we
[1:43:26] we say we are we I mean we are children
[1:43:28] of God you know you find that in the in
[1:43:31] the Christian way you know I'm a Child
[1:43:32] of God I'm I'm a daughter of God and you
[1:43:35] know and and and and that is truth but
[1:43:38] another thing that also goes with those
[1:43:40] things is that uh God
[1:43:46] I wonder how much we appreciate the
[1:43:50] grace that has brought us to this place
[1:43:53] where we stand
[1:43:55] praise the Lord
[1:43:57] you see when a person
[1:43:59] has the uh the spirit of entire to man
[1:44:03] is uh is is difficult for them to to be
[1:44:06] grateful
[1:44:07] because they think that it belongs to me
[1:44:09] I need it now
[1:44:12] you know I have a right to it and I need
[1:44:14] it now
[1:44:16] praise the lord it's difficult
[1:44:18] now you will realize that uh
[1:44:22] mercy and Grace
[1:44:25] We Know Thy Grace the grace of God is
[1:44:28] God
[1:44:29] Divine favor
[1:44:32] that he gave to us that we that we do
[1:44:35] not deserve
[1:44:37] amen
[1:44:39] but Mercy comes a little bit in a
[1:44:42] reverse
[1:44:43] what we deserve
[1:44:45] for our failure
[1:44:47] God did not give it to us
[1:44:50] that's Mercy
[1:44:54] amen
[1:44:56] his Mercy that is Rich to us
[1:45:00] every morning
[1:45:03] it is God looking beyond our thoughts
[1:45:09] looking beyond our hour our failures
[1:45:12] looking beyond our weaknesses
[1:45:16] in meeting our needs
[1:45:19] and a standing Divine favor the
[1:45:22] sustaining divine grace to us
[1:45:25] so that is the thing I want for us to
[1:45:27] look at tonight
[1:45:29] the Bible in the book of Saint Luke
[1:45:31] recorded another story
[1:45:33] word Simon invited Jesus to his house
[1:45:40] and when Jesus came to his house
[1:45:43] we realized that he invited Jesus more
[1:45:48] to make a mockery out of him
[1:45:50] and in that way
[1:45:52] he really did not give Jesus the kind of
[1:45:55] for welcome that he should he should
[1:45:57] receive the washing of his feet
[1:46:00] anointing he moved all he never did none
[1:46:02] of that
[1:46:03] he just allowed him to sit there
[1:46:06] but right in that same house there was
[1:46:09] another woman
[1:46:12] that came
[1:46:13] with a welcoming spirit
[1:46:17] you see church is a big thing we talk
[1:46:19] about keeping the atmosphere in church
[1:46:24] and just like I said on on Sunday
[1:46:30] when you when you think about the
[1:46:32] attributes of God you know it is it's a
[1:46:34] word that that we have been exposed to
[1:46:36] around the message the attributes of God
[1:46:39] when you think about the attributes of
[1:46:41] God
[1:46:42] you'll realize that
[1:46:45] God's attribute is not what he has
[1:46:51] no
[1:46:53] God's attribute is what he is
[1:47:01] praise the Lord
[1:47:03] God don't have love God is love
[1:47:10] praise the Lord
[1:47:12] you and I have love because we can lost
[1:47:15] it whatever you have you can lose it
[1:47:20] God is his attribute
[1:47:26] so when we talk about the the the the
[1:47:29] only present God
[1:47:31] we talk about this great God
[1:47:35] this great intent of God
[1:47:42] you realize that
[1:47:45] God one time fell
[1:47:49] every space
[1:47:51] he filled every space as the great
[1:47:54] internal spirit
[1:47:56] but yet God has not lost their position
[1:48:01] he has not lost that position he still
[1:48:04] fell every space tonight
[1:48:09] he has not lost that position
[1:48:11] because for God to lose it
[1:48:14] again it's not part of him
[1:48:19] he stayed the great internal spirit
[1:48:24] that's why we can believe that we have
[1:48:26] eternal life because his Spirit has come
[1:48:28] in US
[1:48:33] are we together
[1:48:34] so you will see that by the word of God
[1:48:38] and and and God has been so gracious to
[1:48:41] us in this day and age
[1:48:44] honor this move of God to be able to
[1:48:48] help us not just by the uses of words
[1:48:51] but also to be able to expose us to to
[1:48:56] this reality
[1:48:59] that the god that we self he's not a god
[1:49:02] that is that is far off
[1:49:05] like I said on Sunday he's he's he's
[1:49:08] more near than the breath that we
[1:49:10] breathe
[1:49:16] praise the Lord
[1:49:17] he's more near
[1:49:20] he's ever saw me
[1:49:27] ever so near
[1:49:32] praise the Lord
[1:49:35] now so as we as we look into this
[1:49:48] and you look through the scripture
[1:49:51] also you will realize I have a few
[1:49:54] things I'll read to you you look through
[1:49:56] the scripture you will realize that uh
[1:49:59] uh most of those people
[1:50:02] that has uh uh uh been able to to break
[1:50:07] into this present that is so near that
[1:50:10] is so real
[1:50:13] praise the Lord
[1:50:16] it is
[1:50:18] the attitude of approach
[1:50:25] God Is So near
[1:50:27] and the truth of the matter there is
[1:50:29] that many times
[1:50:32] we are so far away from him
[1:50:38] take for example when God came down and
[1:50:40] looking for Adam and said Adam Adam
[1:50:42] where are you
[1:50:44] it's not that God did not know where he
[1:50:46] was
[1:50:49] right but Adam did not know where he was
[1:50:53] it was Adam that did not know where he
[1:50:55] was
[1:50:58] why because he hath left his place
[1:51:02] he had left the position that God has
[1:51:04] given him
[1:51:05] he has fell from the grace of God
[1:51:10] he did not know his where he was that's
[1:51:13] why he was hiding himself
[1:51:16] because this was a man that that was
[1:51:18] that was that was always waiting on uh
[1:51:21] uh Fellowship
[1:51:25] he had access to this great presence
[1:51:30] when it was time for Fellowship it was
[1:51:32] time for worship he could step into that
[1:51:34] presence anytime
[1:51:38] because it's a presence there is
[1:51:42] accessible
[1:51:44] amen it's a presence that is accessible
[1:51:47] it's a presence that is near is a
[1:51:50] presence that is real
[1:51:52] and is the presence that God expects us
[1:51:55] to live in every day
[1:52:02] praise the Lord
[1:52:03] bringing us to the reality that the god
[1:52:06] that we get on our knees to speak to the
[1:52:09] one we left our hands so he's not he's
[1:52:12] not beyond the clouds
[1:52:18] and one of the things that handle us
[1:52:23] is because we have not found
[1:52:27] the attitude
[1:52:30] of welcoming him
[1:52:32] we have not found that that welcoming
[1:52:35] attitude to know that he's there
[1:52:39] praise the Lord
[1:52:41] the person that you welcome the one that
[1:52:44] you welcome is not far off
[1:52:47] he has to be nine
[1:52:50] you don't welcome someone that is far
[1:52:52] off
[1:52:54] you wait for them to come they are there
[1:52:56] you realize that they are there
[1:52:59] and then you welcome him
[1:53:03] so we share a few quotes with you
[1:53:05] tonight
[1:53:07] and you will realize
[1:53:09] and I see as you look in the in these
[1:53:11] two scriptures that we mentioned tonight
[1:53:14] I believe that
[1:53:17] that was what Jesus identified
[1:53:21] as great faith
[1:53:24] the attitude of those people
[1:53:27] in his presence
[1:53:33] praise the Lord
[1:53:34] amen this woman
[1:53:38] she's trying to get Jesus attention he's
[1:53:41] paying no attention to her
[1:53:43] the disciple even one one her to be Cast
[1:53:46] Away
[1:53:48] praise the Lord
[1:53:49] she did not allow the attitude to affect
[1:53:53] her
[1:53:55] she kept a constant attitude
[1:53:58] to be able to get the Lost attention
[1:54:05] praise the Lord
[1:54:06] sometimes she used their she she tried
[1:54:10] to use a scriptural word thou son of
[1:54:14] David
[1:54:15] just like we were doing prayer only
[1:54:17] putting God almighty God you are the
[1:54:20] ever-present god
[1:54:22] all of those things are wonderful
[1:54:28] Jesus said when you pray he says our
[1:54:31] father
[1:54:32] Hallowed Be Your Name praises to your
[1:54:35] name they are it's all wonderful you
[1:54:38] know identifying God by his his
[1:54:40] attributes and his ability it's all
[1:54:43] beautiful
[1:54:46] but you but we could still do that
[1:54:49] in our mind is far away
[1:54:54] we could do that and and you are looking
[1:54:57] for God in the clouds
[1:55:03] you are trying to send your mind
[1:55:05] somewhere to go and find him when he's
[1:55:07] right here
[1:55:12] she used the right word thou son of
[1:55:15] David
[1:55:19] when when when blind but he must use it
[1:55:21] it caught his attention
[1:55:23] even in a crowd of noise he could
[1:55:25] identify It capture him
[1:55:29] and this woman trying to you know
[1:55:32] address him with that I mean we you can
[1:55:34] be you can get into all the arguments
[1:55:36] she was not a Jews she was not supposed
[1:55:38] to say I mean all of those things they
[1:55:40] are just arguments
[1:55:46] but the reality there is that she
[1:55:50] possessed something
[1:55:52] there was something that she possessed
[1:55:54] Within
[1:55:57] that welcoming spirit is within
[1:56:00] it's not a mental thing it's within
[1:56:10] praise the Lord
[1:56:17] yeah you I mean you we we deal with that
[1:56:20] sometimes you you know you try to put up
[1:56:22] your best behavior you know just just to
[1:56:26] be able to accommodate your guests
[1:56:28] but if it is not within it will show so
[1:56:30] soon
[1:56:32] praise the Lord because as soon as
[1:56:35] things start going out of the order you
[1:56:36] just want them to leave I can't wait for
[1:56:38] them to get out of here oh my God
[1:56:47] you see so it was something that she
[1:56:49] possessed Within
[1:56:52] a welcoming spirit
[1:56:58] praise the Lord
[1:57:00] the woman that was Jesus filled with her
[1:57:03] tears
[1:57:05] she also
[1:57:07] brought that before the Lord
[1:57:13] amen
[1:57:15] she brought that she she make him to
[1:57:17] feel welcome
[1:57:21] I tell you church that's when we get the
[1:57:24] blessing
[1:57:26] not as in or not in all our emotional
[1:57:30] exercise is when God feel welcome
[1:57:35] when he realized that it is not about
[1:57:38] you and it's not about me if we are not
[1:57:41] making if God realize that we are not
[1:57:43] making ourselves
[1:57:46] the subject of attention
[1:57:53] praise the Lord
[1:57:58] he is the subject of attention
[1:58:04] he's the one that we must be paying
[1:58:06] attention to he is the one we must be
[1:58:08] praising he's the one that we must be
[1:58:10] lifting up it is because of him that we
[1:58:12] are here
[1:58:15] praise the Lord and we must be able to
[1:58:18] show that it's because of him that we
[1:58:20] are here
[1:58:24] sometimes it looks like it's all because
[1:58:26] of us for the sins that we are so caught
[1:58:29] up in ourselves
[1:58:32] and we get our mind in insult your face
[1:58:35] we get so so uh uh uh uh uh uh take
[1:58:39] their color credit card or whatever it
[1:58:40] is
[1:58:49] like I said I have few thoughts here to
[1:58:51] read I won't keep you long
[1:58:55] my commission
[1:58:57] I read this one
[1:59:00] if I if I remember right I think I spoke
[1:59:03] on this uh some years back
[1:59:06] but in a different way
[1:59:07] and I perceive that when you walk up
[1:59:11] there's a welcoming spirit
[1:59:16] and you are suffering too
[1:59:20] emotion
[1:59:22] in
[1:59:24] her body
[1:59:27] she's dealing with pains
[1:59:30] or whatever she's dealing with in her
[1:59:32] body
[1:59:34] but yes she's keeping her attitude right
[1:59:40] praise the Lord
[1:59:42] she's not making her pain the center of
[1:59:45] attention
[1:59:49] praise the Lord
[1:59:51] because sometimes people know how to
[1:59:52] make their pain the center of attention
[1:59:56] right
[1:59:58] because that's that's all they talk
[2:00:00] about
[2:00:02] they whine about it hmm
[2:00:08] oh this thing will kill me
[2:00:12] if it's okay you should be dead long
[2:00:14] time
[2:00:17] praise the Lord
[2:00:22] that's a welcome spirit and and you are
[2:00:25] suffering too that's right
[2:00:27] but standing here are the platform just
[2:00:30] now
[2:00:32] as he walk up I fell a welcoming spirit
[2:00:35] and I said you are a Christian you are a
[2:00:38] Christian believer now that's the same
[2:00:41] spirit
[2:00:43] The Same Spirit they are said through
[2:00:46] the master
[2:00:48] to Nathaniel behold an Israelite
[2:00:52] indeed a believer
[2:00:55] and Israelite in whom there is no God
[2:00:59] praise the Lord
[2:01:06] balbraham says God is not an onlooker
[2:01:12] the reason why he called us as his
[2:01:15] children is for him to bless us
[2:01:21] he comes down to bless us
[2:01:26] praise the Lord
[2:01:33] he come down to discern our knees and to
[2:01:36] minister to the same
[2:01:41] many times
[2:01:44] is our attitude
[2:01:48] praise the Lord
[2:01:50] it's our attitude
[2:01:53] glory be to God
[2:01:56] amen
[2:02:01] a man can come behind this Pulpit with
[2:02:04] the most porous gift
[2:02:07] poor as a gift he can be one of the most
[2:02:09] poorest preacher just like myself
[2:02:12] but the attitude of the people
[2:02:15] wanting to receive from God
[2:02:21] can put that man in a channel
[2:02:24] well he can be a blessing to us
[2:02:30] how much called
[2:02:36] after all this now the preacher that
[2:02:38] brings the blessing
[2:02:40] brother Brian said it's not an
[2:02:42] evangelist that comes to time that
[2:02:44] brings the Revival he says it's the
[2:02:46] people
[2:02:49] the
[2:02:50] Evangelist just comes to stirred what is
[2:02:53] in us what is in our mess
[2:03:07] you see that time and time and time
[2:03:12] and for many of the cases
[2:03:16] that that is mentioned a welcoming
[2:03:18] spirit is mentioned there is there is I
[2:03:21] mean the the the the gift just flew
[2:03:33] deep college today first time you don't
[2:03:35] you don't know nothing about me and Adam
[2:03:39] the letter is a Christian because she
[2:03:42] has a real welcoming spirit
[2:03:45] and she conscious of some things here
[2:03:50] at the platform
[2:03:52] not a man
[2:03:54] Danger
[2:03:55] of God is here
[2:03:58] praise the Lord
[2:04:01] the Bible says the angels of the Lord
[2:04:03] are in come about that about those that
[2:04:05] fear Him
[2:04:07] the angels of the Lord are here
[2:04:13] praise the Lord
[2:04:15] are we conscious of it
[2:04:24] one of the place where the Bible ever
[2:04:27] used this statement was in uh Jacob
[2:04:30] experience there are belter
[2:04:33] when he lie his hair to to rest and he
[2:04:36] broke into a vision and he he had a
[2:04:39] vision or a dream and saw angels
[2:04:41] ascending and descending
[2:04:44] he said this is the Gate of Heaven he
[2:04:47] didn't say Gates it's not Gates it's not
[2:04:49] it does not have an S it's a gate one
[2:04:51] gate
[2:04:53] praise the Lord he says this is the Gate
[2:04:56] of Heaven
[2:04:58] amen
[2:05:00] he says the Lord is here and I never
[2:05:02] knew it
[2:05:08] praise the Lord
[2:05:12] he says the Lord is here and I never
[2:05:14] knew it
[2:05:19] and I believe this
[2:05:23] if the Lord would just help us
[2:05:28] praise the Lord
[2:05:32] when bad atmosphere is among the people
[2:05:40] I mean the presence of God becomes so
[2:05:43] real
[2:05:44] that even the ones that are weak ones
[2:05:47] and the ones that are struggling and the
[2:05:49] ones that are doubting
[2:05:51] God can be able to help them
[2:06:03] have faith in God just few of them that
[2:06:06] I have to read tonight
[2:06:08] you believe me do you serve I truly
[2:06:12] believe
[2:06:13] for between you and I
[2:06:16] seems to be a welcoming spirit
[2:06:21] more I talk to you perhaps the more the
[2:06:24] Lord Jesus will show us tell us reveal
[2:06:28] to us
[2:06:34] praise the Lord
[2:06:38] I mean that's all the Lord is spread of
[2:06:40] his people
[2:06:44] that all he expect of his people
[2:06:52] and over and over we have been taught
[2:06:55] how is the atmosphere that brings the
[2:06:58] result
[2:07:03] praise the Lord
[2:07:05] it's the atmosphere that brings the
[2:07:08] result
[2:07:13] we are just we are just welcoming his
[2:07:16] presence we are opening ourselves
[2:07:20] to the present that is already here
[2:07:24] amen
[2:07:27] that's what we must be doing
[2:07:29] we must be opening ourselves
[2:07:32] setting our thoughts aside
[2:07:37] to that presence of the Lord that is
[2:07:39] already here
[2:07:43] praise the Lord
[2:07:46] I mean as as a pastor with with uh We've
[2:07:50] uh We've a couple of times you you you
[2:07:52] you can see it you you feel it I think
[2:07:54] there was there was a couple of
[2:07:56] Wednesdays I think is that two or three
[2:07:58] Wednesday night to go
[2:08:00] uh
[2:08:02] I mean it was it was just so easy you
[2:08:05] could just feed it when you come down
[2:08:06] you feel you feel the people right in
[2:08:09] their atmosphere
[2:08:13] is some of the things that makes it a
[2:08:15] joy to be in the house of the Lord
[2:08:20] I was glad when he said let us go into
[2:08:22] the house of the Lord
[2:08:24] we come with that gladness we come with
[2:08:27] that relaxed mind it's not like a
[2:08:29] punishment it's not like oh yeah we're
[2:08:31] coming to be sit down yet again and
[2:08:33] spend all of this time here
[2:08:37] no but they're just
[2:08:39] there is just that peace
[2:08:43] it's the place that we want to be
[2:08:47] we enjoy being there
[2:08:49] we enjoy being in a service we enjoy
[2:08:52] being in the presence of the Lord
[2:08:55] we enjoy the songs that we sing
[2:08:58] praise the Lord
[2:09:03] a prayer is said to the Lord we enjoyed
[2:09:06] the Lord being praised
[2:09:12] when a man said Lord I bless your name
[2:09:14] you see it right Beyond it I bless your
[2:09:16] name Jesus
[2:09:25] that's not having the form of godliness
[2:09:29] having the form of godliness we just
[2:09:31] want everything to be you know
[2:09:33] everything to just to be I mean he's
[2:09:35] praying too long
[2:09:37] he's talking to your father
[2:09:39] he's talking to the god
[2:09:42] that you came to wash it
[2:09:44] they say oh he's praying too long
[2:09:49] praise the Lord
[2:09:55] all he said he's singing off Keith
[2:09:59] I mean we bring all of those attitude
[2:10:02] and and those things
[2:10:04] is just it make us we come short of his
[2:10:07] presence
[2:10:11] we don't have to welcome his presence
[2:10:13] his presence is already here
[2:10:17] he's here
[2:10:24] it's recreating
[2:10:27] a welcoming atmosphere
[2:10:30] acknowledging the presence that we are
[2:10:33] in being just like Jacob the Lord is in
[2:10:36] this place and I didn't know it
[2:10:39] that's why Jacob said
[2:10:43] it creates such an excitement it creates
[2:10:46] such an expectation
[2:10:53] because we know what I mean what what do
[2:10:56] we expect to receive from the Lord but
[2:10:58] to be blessed
[2:11:02] it's not a question of whether we will
[2:11:04] be blessed or not
[2:11:06] we know that we will be blessed
[2:11:11] so we come with that with that
[2:11:13] expectation we come with that attitude
[2:11:17] to be blessed to enjoy the presence of
[2:11:19] the Lord
[2:11:21] enjoy the specials that is that that
[2:11:23] have been sunk
[2:11:24] enjoy the songs that we sing enjoy the
[2:11:27] music
[2:11:28] enjoy the word of God
[2:11:32] and we are glad about it we are excited
[2:11:35] about it
[2:11:36] just enjoying the presence of the Lord
[2:11:54] having a welcoming spirit
[2:11:58] that's what
[2:12:00] I believe that Jesus called great faith
[2:12:04] when people have that attitude
[2:12:07] they are a people of great faith
[2:12:12] praise the Lord
[2:12:15] if the word called them out just like
[2:12:17] the woman says that the bread I mean the
[2:12:19] bread that's the children bread it's not
[2:12:21] for dogs she said that's okay Lord
[2:12:25] the dogs can also eat the crumbs
[2:12:30] praise the Lord
[2:12:35] they are understanding that that uh uh
[2:12:38] acknowledgment of who who the Lord Jesus
[2:12:42] was to her she did not allow anything to
[2:12:46] affect
[2:12:49] the feelings that she had in her heart
[2:12:53] she knew that this man have the answer
[2:12:56] to my daughter's situation
[2:12:59] so she did not allow anything
[2:13:02] whether he was ignoring her she did not
[2:13:04] she did not allow to get into that place
[2:13:07] of complex
[2:13:10] she kept that that was what Jesus was
[2:13:13] identifying as a great faith
[2:13:25] praise the Lord
[2:13:30] oh may God gave us a welcoming spirit
[2:13:34] just how to make the Lord to be pleased
[2:13:38] to do it in our mess
[2:13:42] praise the Lord
[2:13:56] you know in the book of Arts
[2:13:59] but Ben says how as chapter 5 will be
[2:14:02] back in the church
[2:14:05] that's another subject in itself
[2:14:10] because for a long time I thought
[2:14:13] they are their
[2:14:15] uh when I read that I've always thought
[2:14:18] that at that that as chapter 5
[2:14:22] just like how the
[2:14:24] unmiasing his wife was called out
[2:14:27] during Peter meeting
[2:14:29] you know we always look over to that
[2:14:32] negative part but when I started
[2:14:34] studying it through the message I
[2:14:35] realized that he was talking about the
[2:14:38] gift of the sermon that was already here
[2:14:42] that the same way how he called anani
[2:14:45] because you see sometimes that's that is
[2:14:47] that is the way that our falling mind is
[2:14:49] we always like we measure on the manner
[2:14:53] yeah we always look at the negative part
[2:14:57] of it then then the positive part of it
[2:15:00] but for a long time I've always thought
[2:15:02] you know it would be that that gift that
[2:15:05] would come back to the church and say
[2:15:06] brother you have just taught a lie today
[2:15:08] you lie to your wife
[2:15:12] praise the Lord
[2:15:15] but the prophet of God said that gift
[2:15:16] has been here the word of God
[2:15:19] is sharper than the two-edges world
[2:15:21] Discerning the intents of our heart
[2:15:24] every time the word is preached to us we
[2:15:27] are right back in Acts chapter 5.
[2:15:34] it's calling out things in our life
[2:15:37] is also encouraging us
[2:15:40] it's not only there to condemn it's also
[2:15:42] there to instruct us
[2:15:46] how we can better walk with the Lord
[2:15:49] how we can come please him with the Lord
[2:15:55] how we can have a a easy access into his
[2:15:59] presence
[2:16:01] is by a welcoming spirit
[2:16:05] praise the Lord
[2:16:10] we come to Worship the Lord
[2:16:14] if the deacons you
[2:16:16] correct me out there or maybe say
[2:16:20] something to me correct me let me say it
[2:16:22] that way
[2:16:23] I mean I Came To Worship the Lord
[2:16:26] why should I allow that to handle me
[2:16:31] why should I be true off by that
[2:16:42] are we together
[2:16:44] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:16:46] and forever this will be the last one
[2:16:48] I would I would read I just pick this
[2:16:50] few among many he says for you already
[2:16:53] are a Christian
[2:16:55] your spirit
[2:16:57] is welcoming
[2:16:59] see if it was an unbelievable
[2:17:03] it will know it right quick
[2:17:06] but you got a welcoming
[2:17:10] spirit
[2:17:12] praise the Lord
[2:17:14] a Christian Spirit must be a welcoming
[2:17:16] spirit
[2:17:20] and sometimes that's what people feel
[2:17:23] when they just asks you are you a
[2:17:25] Christian
[2:17:26] they just fear something
[2:17:30] be fair a welcome spirit
[2:17:37] I knew that
[2:17:46] praise the Lord
[2:17:53] I mean that's just how healing and
[2:17:56] deliverance comes to the body
[2:18:01] if the people
[2:18:06] knows how to acknowledge God's presence
[2:18:12] the thing that make us to be reverence
[2:18:14] in the house of God it makes us to you
[2:18:17] know uh not to be cause destruction and
[2:18:21] all of that is just that that thing is
[2:18:24] it's not it's not the place where we we
[2:18:27] we come and and stop pounding Church
[2:18:30] order into your head right
[2:18:35] thou welcoming spirit and thou Spirit of
[2:18:38] reverence
[2:18:39] will order you right into church order
[2:18:44] we will not have to preach Church order
[2:18:46] every every service
[2:18:53] well we have a church order you know we
[2:18:55] have a church or the church order says

[2:19:00] in that way we have become we're trying
[2:19:02] to be formal
[2:19:07] you know that's the church order
[2:19:10] but a welcoming spirit is a Christian
[2:19:12] spirit

[2:19:17] spirit

[2:19:24] the time
[2:19:25] whether we are in a message church or we
[2:19:28] are visiting another church is not
[2:19:30] because we are outside that we must lose
[2:19:31] it
[2:19:33] that consciousness of his presence Even
[2:19:36] in our home
[2:19:38] Even in our own time of prayer
[2:19:43] we don't allow the buzzing of the phone
[2:19:45] and everything going about to to
[2:19:47] distract us from that presence
