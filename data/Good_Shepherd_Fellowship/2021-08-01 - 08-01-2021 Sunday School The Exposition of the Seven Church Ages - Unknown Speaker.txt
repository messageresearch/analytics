========================================

[Music] and the judge of all the earth he shall be and with equity and perfection will he judge mankind and there will be no evading that judgment no turning of that justice there will be no tempering of it he that is unjust will be unjust still he that is filthy will be filthy still the unchanging one will not change then for he never has and never will those feet of brass will crush the enemy they will destroy the antichrist the beast and the image and all that is vile in his sight he'll destroy the church systems that have taken his name only to corrupt its brilliance and crush them along with the antichrist all the wicked the atheists the agnostics the modernists the liberals will all be there death hell and the grave will be there yes they will for when he comes the books will be opened that is when even the lukewarm church and the five foolish virgins will appear he will separate the sheep from the goats when he comes he will take over the kingdom for it is his and with him will be the thousands times ten thousands his bride who will come to minister to him glory oh it is now or never repent before it is too late wake up from amongst the dead and seek god to be filled with his spirit or you will miss eternal life do it now while there is time for his voice was as the sound of many waters now what do the waters represent hear it in revelation 17 15 the waters which thou sawest are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues his voice was as the sound of multitude speaking what is it it is the judgment for these are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the holy spirit all through the ages have testified to christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment against the sinner who would not take warning the voices of the seven messengers will be heard loud and clear those faithful preachers who preached the saving power of jesus who preached water baptism in jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the holy ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost down through the ages john 17 20 neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word have you ever thought how terrifying it is to a man drifting helplessly toward a cataract think now of that roar as he approaches his sure and certain doom and just exactly like that is coming the day of judgment when the roar of the multitude of voices condemns you for not having paid heed heir it was too late take heed this very hour for at this moment your thoughts are being recorded in heaven there your thoughts speak louder than your words like the pharisee who claimed so much with his mouth but not listening to the lord his heart became corrupt and evil until it was too late even now this could be your last call to hear the word and receive it unto eternal life it will be too late when you approach the roar of the many voices of judgment and doom but have you ever noticed how sweet and relaxing the sound of water can be i like to fish and i like to find a spot where the water is whispering in ripples i can just lie back and hear it speaking peace and joy and contentment to my heart how glad i am to be anchored in the haven of rest where the voice of the lord speaks peace as the word of the waters of separation has declared how thankful we should be to hear his voice of love and care and guidance and protection and someday we will hear that same sweet voice speak not in judgment but in welcome to us whose sins have been remitted by his blood whose lives have been spirit filled and whose walk was in the word what could be more precious than to hear the multitudes of welcoming voices and be surrounded by those multitudes who have believed unto eternal life oh there is nothing like it i pray that you will hear his voice and harden not your heart but receive him as your king oh if you would only see it it was the waters that destroyed the world but it was the same waters that saved noah and also saved the whole earth for noah listen to his voice the voice of his servants as it calls to repentance and life five in his right hand were seven stars and he had in his right hand seven stars now of course we already know from verse 20 what the seven stars actually are and the mystery of the seven stars are the angels messengers of the seven churches now we couldn't make a mistake here on any account as he interprets it for us these seven stars are the messengers to the seven successive church ages they are not called by name they are just set forth as seven one to each age from the ephesian age on down to this laodicean age each messenger brought the message of truth to the people never failing to keep it the word of god to that particular church age each one held to it they were steadfast in their loyalty to the original light as each age pulled away from god his faithful messenger turned that age back to the word their strength was from the lord or they never could have stemmed the tide they were safe in his care for nothing could pluck them out of his hand and neither could anything separate them from the love of god let it be sickness peril nakedness famine sword life or death they were truly yielded to him and kept by his omnipotence they were not concerned about the persecution that came their way pain and derision was but caused to give glory to god but they were counted worthy to suffer for him and in thankfulness for his salvation they burned with the light of his life and reflected his love patience meekness temperance gentleness faithfulness and god backed them up with wonders signs and miracles they were accused of being fanatics and holy rollers they were denounced by organizations and held in mockery but they kept true to the word now it is not hard to stand up and keep true to a creed it is easy for the devil is right behind all that but it is something else to be true to god's word and go back to what the word originally produced after pentecost not long ago a man said to me that the roman catholic church had to be the true church as it had been true to what it believed over all the years and kept on growing and not changing that isn't so at all any church with the government behind it and with its own creed which isn't the word at all and with no manifested ministry to cause the devil to get aroused could surely carry on that was not a criterion but when you think of that little group whose members were saw on asunder fed to lions persecuted and driven from pillar to post and yet stayed true to the word now definitely that would have to be god how they survived their battle of faith and carried on still that is the miracle and this comfort is not for the seven church age messengers only every true believer is in the hand of god and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that god is to the believer what god gives the messenger and how he blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body amen 6. the two-edged sword and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword in hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart out of his mouth went the sharp two-edged sword which is the word of god revelation 19 11-16 and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords john 1 48 nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou was under the fig tree i saw thee there it is when he comes that word will come against all nations and all men and none will be able to stand against it it will reveal what was in every heart as he did with nathanael the word of god will show who did the will of god and who didn't it will make known the secret works of every man and why he did them it will divide asunder that is what it says in romans 2 3 and thinkest thou this o man that judges them which do such things and do us the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god then it goes on to say how god is going to judge men here it is in verses 5 to 17 the hard impenitent heart will be judged the works will be judged the motives will be judged there won't be any respect before god but all will be judged by that word no one escaping it those who hurt and wouldn't listen will be judged by what they heard those that rested in it saying they believed it but didn't live it will be judged every secret will come out in the open and be shouted from the housetops oh we will really understand history then there won't be a mystery left from all the ages but do you know that he is revealing the heart secrets of men and women in this age in which we are living who else could reveal the secrets of the heart but the word himself hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it is the word it is performing where unto it was sent for it the word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age as a last sign trying to head the people off from judgment for they that reject him the word are now already come into judgment crucifying him afresh hebrews 6 6 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame now paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciences of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set captives free everywhere these early believers went they went preaching the gospel word and god confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom seven his face like the sun and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength matthew 17 1-13 and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son and whom i am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist now in matthew 16 28 prefacing matthew 17 1-13 jesus had said there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and the three apostles did see just that the order of his second coming they saw him transfigured there on the mountain top his raiment was blazing white and his face shone like the sun at its zenith and there as he appeared stood moses and elijah on either side that is exactly how he is coming again truly elijah will first come and turn the hearts of the children bride back to the father's apostolic word doctrine malachi 4 5-6 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse israel is already a nation she is established now with her army's navy postal system flag and all that pertains to nationhood but there is still to be fulfilled the scripture that says or shall a nation be born at once isaiah 66 8 that day is coming soon the fig tree has put forth her buds the israelites are waiting for the messiah they are expecting him and their expectations are about to be fulfilled israel will be reborn spiritually for her light and her life are about to be revealed to her in revelation 21 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof this is the new jerusalem the lamb will be in that city and because of his presence there will be no light needed the sun won't rise and shine there for he is the sun and light thereof himself the nations that come into it will walk in his light aren't you happy that day is upon us john saw that day coming even so lord jesus come quickly malachi 4 1-3 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts there it is again the sun shining out in all its strength oh the strength of the son of god shining in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks there he stands the judge the one who suffered and died for us he took the wrath of divine judgment upon himself he tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of god alone as we have already stated to the sinner his voice is as the sound of the cataract or the surf pounding in waves of death upon the rocky shores but to the saint his voice is as the sound of the sweetly singing brook as you lie at rest satisfied in christ shining upon us with his warming rays of love he says fear not i am he which was which is which is to come i am the almighty beside me there is no other i am the alpha and omega the all of it he's the lily of the valley the bright and morning star he's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul yes that great day is ready to break and the sun of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings the victorious christ revelation 1 17-18 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death no human being could stand the full effect of that vision his strength utterly gone john fell at his feet as though dead but the hand of the lord in love touched him and the voice of blessings said fear not don't be afraid i am the first and last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore what is there to fear the judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus see for a surety our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge as judge the case is settled it is finished there is now therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should it fear punishment or death it has all been overcome here is the mighty conqueror here is the one who conquered both worlds of the seen and unseen not like alexander who conquered the world at the age of 33 and knew no other way to turn for further conquest so he died a victim of sin and riotous living not like napoleon who conquered all europe but finally was defeated at waterloo and banished to elba only to find himself conquered but nothing could conquer christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him has been given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell and the grave and has the keys thereof what he loses is loosed and what he binds is bound there is no changing of it there was no conqueror before him and there is none beside him he alone is the savior redeemer he is the only god and lord jesus christ is his name don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i am you are heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail the seven stars and candlesticks revelation 1 20. the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels messengers of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches we have already discovered the truth of these two mysteries or we haven't revealed who these seven messengers were but by the help of god we will and that mystery will be accomplished the seven ages we know they are listed in the word and we will deal with each so as to come up to this last age in which we live but in one last closing glimpse of this chapter see him as he stands there in the midst of the golden lamp stands with the seven stars in his right hand oh it is breathtaking to see him standing there in his supreme deity he is the judge the priest the king the eagle the lamb the lion the alpha the omega the beginning and the end the father son holy ghost he which was which is which is to come the almighty be all and all there he is the author and finisher worthy is that lamb he proved his worth as he bought our salvation by himself now he stands in all his power and all his glory with all things committed unto him as judge yes there he stands amidst the lamp stands with the stars in his hand it is night for that is when we use lamps for light and that is when the stars are seen shining and reflecting the light of the sun and it is dark the church is walking by faith in the darkness her lord departed this earth but the holy spirit still shines out through the church giving light to this old sin cursed world and those stars reflect his light also the only light they have is his light how dark it is how spiritually cold yet when he comes into the midst it is light and warm and the church is empowered and through him does the works that he did oh that we might get a glimpse of him as did john what manner of people we ought to be standing before him at that day if you have not already given your life to him may you turn your heart to god this moment and kneel down right where you are and ask his forgiveness for your sins and surrender your life to him then we will attempt to approach the seven church ages together and as we do i pray that god will help this unworthy servant to reveal his word to you chapter three the ephesian church age introduction to the church ages in order for you to fully understand the message of the church ages i would like to explain the various principles that allowed me to arrive at the names of the messengers the length of the ages and other factors involved therein since this study was to be the most serious one i had ever undertaken up to this time i sought god for many days for the inspiration of the holy spirit then only did i read the scriptures on the church ages and delve into the many church histories written by the most unbiased historians that i could find god did not fail to answer my prayer for while i read the word and the histories i was enabled by the holy spirit to see unfolded a pattern that runs through the centuries and right into this present last day the key given me of the lord whereby i was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the keystone of the bible it is the revelation that god never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is in hebrews 13 8 it says jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever ecclesiastes 3 14-15 i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god doeth it that man should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be have already been and god requireth that which is past here it is an unchanging god with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that god chose for the first age and how god manifested in that man's ministry would be the example for all other ages what god did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the holy spirit how the first or original church was founded and how god manifested himself in her the word can't change or be changed because the word is god john 1 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god to change one word of it as did eve bring sin and death even as it says in revelation 22 18-19 if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book thus what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close though scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over don't you believe it such a statement is wrong on two counts first of all it is wrong to suppose there aren't any more apostles just because the original 12 are dead an apostle means ascent one and there are many sent ones today but they are called missionaries as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life there is an apostolic age going on secondly they refer to an age of manifested holy ghost power as being over since the bible has been completed that is untrue there is not even one scripture that suggests that but many conclusively state otherwise here is our proof that both of these charges are false acts 2 38-39 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call the promise of power with which the apostles were indeed at pentecost is to you jews and to your children jews and to all that are afar off gentiles and to as many as the lord our god shall call both jew and gentile until he stops calling the pentecostal message and power will not cease what the church [Music] you
