[46:42] that Friday if any change we'll let you
[46:45] know but let's uh let's plan towards
[46:47] that. Let's pray and towards them.

[46:56] BYC and uh we thank the Lord for
[46:59] granting them a safe travel and uh
[47:02] blessing them all through the weekend
[47:05] and having them back with us. That's
[47:08] that's wonderful. Praise the Lord. And
[47:11] uh uh those that were not able to go,

[47:33] Jeffersonville. So they were able to

[47:44] the Lord. So we want to thank the Lord
[47:46] for that and uh uh uh just uh thank the
[47:51] Lord for everything that his grace is uh
[47:54] is doing doing in our life and doing in

[53:42] "I will build my church." And we can
[53:45] count on that. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[53:48] together this morning. Heavenly Father,
[53:50] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we

[54:15] Father. Blessed be your name, oh God.
[54:18] this morning as we about to approach
[54:21] your word, we want to pray that God, you
[54:23] will humble our hearts, Lord. Oh, Father
[54:26] God, that we will be able to receive
[54:28] from you. Almighty God, Lord, you that

[54:35] ground, Lord, Father, and washed the

[56:21] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Thank you.
[56:25] Thank you musicians.
[56:27] And uh
[56:30] praise the Lord. Let's take our Bibles.
[56:35] Let's take our Bibles. Sorry I told you
[56:38] to have your seat when I should have
[56:40] read and have you sit down. Sorry for
[56:43] having you to stand again, but let's
[56:45] take our Bibles and and uh
[56:50] and we will read Psalm 22.
[56:54] Last Sunday we preached from Psalm 22
[56:57] showing the church in prophecy.
[56:59] Today I want to speak on the birth cry
[57:02] of the church.
[57:03] The birth cry of the church.
[57:09] Praise the Lord.
[57:14] The birth cry of the church.
[57:18] Psalm chapter 22. Let's just read uh uh
[57:23] verse one and verse two.
[57:26] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[57:29] me? Why art thou so far from helping me
[57:34] and from the words of mine rolling? Oh
[57:38] my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou
[57:42] hearth not and in the night season
[57:45] and I'm not silent. Praise the Lord. The
[57:49] Lord bless you. You may have your seat.
[57:53] Amen.
[57:56] in the message uh my new ministry
[57:59] brother said this and I I want to I want
[58:02] to uh start off uh like this. Look at
[58:05] David in Psalm 22 crying, "My God, my
[58:09] God, why have thou forsaken me?" Not
[58:12] David. It was Christ 800 years later.
[58:16] All my bones stir at me. Uh uh uh they
[58:21] struck my my my lips.
[58:24] stuck out my lips their lips at me.
[58:28] The the wig of their head said he saved
[58:31] others but himself he cannot save. David
[58:36] speaking that as if it was himself but
[58:40] it was the spirit of God in him. Christ
[58:44] speaking forth. Oh God be praised.
[58:50] Moving into his church
[58:53] in the the fullness of his power, moving
[58:57] among his people, spreading out his
[59:01] great wings of mercy. May he be praised.
[59:05] Amen. Praise the Lord. Now we we we
[59:10] titled this the birth cry of the church.
[59:14] Uh and and what we want to look at is uh
[59:17] uh
[59:19] uh looking at this promise
[59:23] that God promises people. I will never
[59:26] leave you. I will never forsake you.
[59:30] Amen.
[59:31] That is something that we quote all the
[59:33] time. He said, I will never leave you. I
[59:36] will never forsake you.
[59:38] And uh and most of the time, you know,
[59:40] we will we will quote that as Jesus, you
[59:44] know, statement to the church. Uh Jesus
[59:47] said it to the church. But in the way
[59:49] that we quote it, it was the way that
[59:52] Paul said it to to to the saints uh in
[59:56] the book of Hebrew. And that's what I
[59:58] want us to look at. That's where I want
[1:00:00] for us to start this morning in Hebrew
[1:00:03] chapter 13.
[1:00:06] Let's go to Hebrew chapter 13. We will
[1:00:08] start off from there.
[1:00:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:14] Amen.
[1:00:29] Hebrews chapter 13.
[1:00:33] Hebrews chapter 13, let's read uh uh
[1:00:37] from verse one. Hebrews chapter 13. Let
[1:00:40] brotherly love continue.
[1:00:43] Be not forgetful to entertain strangers,
[1:00:47] for thereby some have entertained angels
[1:00:49] on the way. Remember them
[1:00:53] that are imbalance
[1:00:56] as bound with them and them we suffer
[1:00:59] adversity as being ourself also in the
[1:01:04] body. Praise the Lord. Just remembering
[1:01:07] that uh just reading this it kind of
[1:01:10] bring bring to my mind uh uh that we can
[1:01:13] uh remember uh some family over in
[1:01:16] Texas. some of you that uh were able to
[1:01:19] pick that on your news feed on your
[1:01:21] phone and uh and these kids were out
[1:01:24] there uh camping by boys camp and girls
[1:01:28] camp and uh the banks of the water
[1:01:30] overflowed and and many of the young
[1:01:33] people got caught up in debt and some
[1:01:35] have lost their lives. So uh as uh Paul
[1:01:39] remind us to remember them and uh that
[1:01:41] are in bounds to also remember them that
[1:01:43] are hurting this morning. Amen. And uh
[1:01:46] let's just pray. Heavenly Father, uh I
[1:01:49] had that on my heart this morning. Oh
[1:01:51] God, I will mention it and we can live
[1:01:54] for prayers to you for the many
[1:01:56] families, Lord, that are hurting. Oh
[1:01:58] God, they left home and uh for a
[1:02:02] retreat, a camp, whatever it was, Lord,
[1:02:04] Father, and oh God, Lord Jesus, sad
[1:02:07] enough, Lord, Father, Gordon to the
[1:02:10] situation. We just want to pray Lord
[1:02:13] that's the least that we can do is to
[1:02:16] identify our hearts with their pains. We
[1:02:18] pray that God you will comfort them in
[1:02:21] Jesus name. Amen. We continue to read
[1:02:25] marriage is honorable in all and the bed
[1:02:28] undefied but all mongers and idolattors
[1:02:32] God will judge. Let your conversation be
[1:02:35] without covertiousness, and be content
[1:02:38] with such things as ye have, for he have
[1:02:43] said.
[1:02:45] For he hath said, I will never leave
[1:02:49] thee, nor forsake thee. Now, when Paul
[1:02:53] says this,
[1:02:55] he picked this up as a promise from
[1:02:57] Genesis.
[1:02:59] I want us to trace it a little bit.
[1:03:01] Genesis chapter 28 verse1 15. This was
[1:03:04] Jacob. Uh uh God dealing with Jacob
[1:03:10] uh uh when he met the angel
[1:03:13] uh
[1:03:20] the the the vision or the dream that he
[1:03:22] had Jacob lads Genesis 28 the Bible says
[1:03:26] here in verse 13 let's read and behold
[1:03:29] the Lord stood above it above the ladder
[1:03:32] and said I am the Lord God of Abraham
[1:03:34] the Father, the the God of Isaac, the
[1:03:38] land where unto thou uh that Lar to thee
[1:03:41] will I give it and to thy seed, and thy
[1:03:44] seed shall be as the dust of the earth,
[1:03:48] and thou shall spread abroad, to the
[1:03:51] west, and to the east, and to the north,
[1:03:53] and to the south, and in thee and in thy
[1:03:57] seed shall all the family of the earth
[1:04:00] be blessed. the same promise given to
[1:04:02] Abraham going down to his seed. Now in
[1:04:05] verse 15, he says, "And behold, I am
[1:04:08] with thee, and will keep thee in all
[1:04:12] places where thou goest." Amen. And I
[1:04:17] will bring thee again into this land,
[1:04:21] for I will not leave thee until I have
[1:04:25] done that which I have spoken of thee.
[1:04:29] Praise the Lord. So when when uh uh uh
[1:04:35] Paul make this statement and and it's
[1:04:38] it's all true all through the scripture
[1:04:40] you find God promising Israel uh
[1:04:43] Deuteronomy chapter 31:6 be strong and
[1:04:46] and and of good courage fear not uh not
[1:04:50] be afraid of them for the Lord thy God
[1:04:53] he he it is that does go with thee I
[1:04:57] will not fail thee nor forsake take
[1:05:00] thee. Praise the Lord. Uh uh 1st Samuel
[1:05:05] chapter 12 um verse 22. For the Lord
[1:05:09] will not forsake his people
[1:05:12] for his great names sake because it has
[1:05:17] pleased the Lord to make you his people.
[1:05:21] Now I was reading there and then uh uh
[1:05:24] in my mind I'm thinking here is David
[1:05:28] here and you look through the scripture
[1:05:30] you will see many of God's people and
[1:05:33] many of us every one of us one way or or
[1:05:36] the other have been associated with this
[1:05:40] feeling of being alone or being forsaken
[1:05:44] or uh uh uh you know uh going too much
[1:05:49] then we can bear praise Praise the Lord.
[1:05:51] I hope we we enjoyed the service with
[1:05:53] brother Dilly on uh on on Wednesday
[1:05:56] night. Amen. Uh uh teaching us a lesson
[1:05:59] there from Job. I I think that was
[1:06:01] beautiful. Praise the Lord. And uh uh uh
[1:06:05] and and there was something also that uh
[1:06:08] uh came out in the studies there and I
[1:06:11] was thinking again I say is what I hope
[1:06:13] the people grab it. If you if you watch
[1:06:16] Job chapter one uh uh when the
[1:06:19] messengers came onto Job, it was four
[1:06:22] times.
[1:06:25] Praise the Lord. If you remember the
[1:06:28] principle of restoration that we spoke
[1:06:30] about, you know, whenever you see those
[1:06:33] those principle or patterns playing out
[1:06:36] in God's word, it it gave you a signal
[1:06:39] that there will be a restoration. Okay.
[1:06:42] Four times the messenger came and told
[1:06:44] Job, "Your cattle has been killed, your
[1:06:46] house is burned, your children is dead."
[1:06:49] And uh and what? So you can take it
[1:06:51] right into Jo a prophecy. The kanga
[1:06:53] wound, the palmer wound, the
[1:06:54] caterpillar, the locust, but God said,
[1:06:57] "I will restore." Amen. Saying, and the
[1:07:00] Bible re said God restored Job
[1:07:02] everything that he lost and even more
[1:07:04] that he had. So that principle run
[1:07:07] through all the word of God. You can see
[1:07:10] it all over the place. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:13] But uh uh uh uh we we we we find ourself
[1:07:17] in this place. Why have thou forsaken
[1:07:20] me? Like brother Del, why me Lord? You
[1:07:23] know, why is this happening to me? Why
[1:07:26] why is that so common uh uh for God's
[1:07:30] people to experience that when we have
[1:07:33] all of these promises right here? Then
[1:07:35] God saying, "I will never leave you. I
[1:07:37] will never forsake you. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:40] That's what we want to look at this
[1:07:42] morning and and uh and and believing
[1:07:44] that God will be able to help us. Amen.
[1:07:48] So last week when we talked about this,
[1:07:50] we brought it out of uh Psalm chapter 22
[1:07:53] and trying to show how uh uh David on a
[1:07:58] prophecy was uh was making a prophecy of
[1:08:02] the church because it's there in Psalm
[1:08:05] 22 that he said, "I will I will declare
[1:08:08] that name unto my brethren." Amen. In
[1:08:12] the midst of the congregation. But when
[1:08:14] Jesus came, he he he talked that uh uh
[1:08:18] in in John chapter 17, he says, "Those
[1:08:21] that you have given me before the word
[1:08:23] began, I have declared my name unto
[1:08:25] them." And uh and we said uh last week,
[1:08:28] Jesus was the first person to use the
[1:08:31] word church. He said, "I will build my
[1:08:34] church." The first time the word church
[1:08:36] was used in scripture, it was used by
[1:08:39] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the
[1:08:42] Lord. And we know that the church is a
[1:08:44] mystical body. Amen. This is just a
[1:08:47] group uh of of the church. But the
[1:08:50] church is a mystical body made out of uh
[1:08:53] uh uh different race, different
[1:08:55] ethnicity, different people, tongues and
[1:08:58] nation from all over the world. Amen.
[1:09:01] And uh uh uh and and Paul let us know
[1:09:04] that it is by one spirit we are baptized
[1:09:08] into that mystical body. Amen. is not by
[1:09:13] uh having the membership of good
[1:09:15] shepherd or choosing good shepherd at
[1:09:17] your church. No, it's by one spirit. And
[1:09:20] that spirit is the spirit of Jesus
[1:09:22] Christ.
[1:09:24] Hallelujah.
[1:09:26] Amen. I rather be in that mystical body
[1:09:28] than to be your pastor of Good Sheeperd
[1:09:30] Church. I mean, that's not just a true
[1:09:33] saying this morning. I'd rather be in
[1:09:35] that mystical body. I rather be uh uh
[1:09:37] part of that body than to be a you know
[1:09:40] part of uh uh good shepherd and good
[1:09:42] shepherd is part of the body but uh good
[1:09:45] sheeperd is not just you know the full
[1:09:47] definition of the church of god this is
[1:09:50] just a place that we have choose
[1:09:51] together so we see that uh it's a
[1:09:54] mystical body and uh and and and and we
[1:09:58] see also that god what we were trying to
[1:10:01] bring to you last week that god purpose
[1:10:04] of the church why Jesus Jesus said, "I
[1:10:07] will be my church." And you know, and
[1:10:09] and that has, you know, that has become
[1:10:12] uh uh uh you know uh uh uh a statement
[1:10:16] that I use all the time, you know, is
[1:10:19] Jesus that said I will be my church and
[1:10:22] I can trust in that that he is going to
[1:10:25] have a church without spot or wrinkle.
[1:10:28] Amen. If he if he have left it to me to
[1:10:31] do it, I mean it would be a failure.
[1:10:33] Amen. we is it's not going to work
[1:10:35] because I don't have the ability to do
[1:10:38] it. But he said he will be his church.
[1:10:40] Amen. And if he and if he's going to do
[1:10:43] it, we know that he's more than able.
[1:10:46] He's going to do it in a way that is
[1:10:48] going to please him, that is going to
[1:10:50] line up with his word. So uh uh but as
[1:10:54] we look at as we were looking last week
[1:10:57] to be able to look at the purpose of the
[1:10:59] church,
[1:11:03] we realize from the book of uh uh Hebrew
[1:11:06] that Paul was uh uh making us to see
[1:11:11] that uh uh how
[1:11:17] he took on flesh
[1:11:19] and then uh uh he identified himself
[1:11:23] with us and called us his brethrens by
[1:11:27] which he decided to declare his name to
[1:11:30] us and uh and and Paul will go on to
[1:11:33] tell the the the believers in Hebrew.
[1:11:37] That's the reason why we must not
[1:11:39] forsake the assembly because God has a
[1:11:41] purpose. Praise the Lord. God has a
[1:11:45] purpose. And just like I said, when God
[1:11:48] started dealing with the church in the
[1:11:49] wilderness, the Bible called Moses and
[1:11:52] his people the church in the wilderness,
[1:11:54] God kept them, you know, in in in a
[1:11:57] community sense. He kept them together.
[1:12:00] They were in the land of Gian. They
[1:12:02] travel uh uh uh through the wilderness
[1:12:05] together. He brought them over to the
[1:12:08] promised land together, you know. Uh so
[1:12:10] that was a a a type. It was a sign that
[1:12:15] the purpose of of the church of God is
[1:12:18] for God to be able to uh uh create his
[1:12:23] own community.
[1:12:26] Praise the Lord. Amen. His own
[1:12:29] community. Now you have to remember when
[1:12:32] uh Isaiah prophesied about the Ma says
[1:12:35] uh uh the government will be upon his
[1:12:37] shoulder.
[1:12:40] That's what he said. Amen.
[1:12:43] He will be the uh the uh uh uh Emmanuel
[1:12:47] and the government will be his shoulder.
[1:12:49] So that means that uh uh uh you know God
[1:12:53] was coming among his people to be able
[1:12:56] to govern them.
[1:12:58] So the church of the living God by one
[1:13:01] spirit when we are baptized into this
[1:13:03] body we actually comes into God
[1:13:06] community.
[1:13:09] Praise the Lord. Amen. And uh and and
[1:13:12] and and the thing that
[1:13:16] that that that keep us in relation
[1:13:20] that keep us in relation in our
[1:13:22] community. The thing that keep us is the
[1:13:25] word of God. Praise the Lord. The word
[1:13:28] keep us in our community. The word
[1:13:31] govern our community. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:36] So uh uh uh we see that uh you know God
[1:13:42] is uh is faithful in what he's doing you
[1:13:45] know uh uh we can we can trust him.
[1:13:48] Let's let's just read some few things
[1:13:50] here that uh that is that is going to
[1:13:53] help us a little bit look at lifting up
[1:13:56] lifting you up out of history. Let's
[1:13:58] let's just read here in uh uh let's take
[1:14:02] church life. There is where it all
[1:14:06] begins.
[1:14:07] Church life is running out. The people
[1:14:11] just take the church today almost for an
[1:14:14] adult like a toting pole. Go sit uh in
[1:14:19] church five meetings and I have done my
[1:14:21] religion. pay in your little
[1:14:23] contribution, whatever it is to pay the
[1:14:26] pastor and and they don't make that up.
[1:14:32] They have a little uh supper and uh and
[1:14:37] and make up to the pastor and if he
[1:14:40] isn't satisfied, he haul off somewhere
[1:14:43] else that uh will give him a better
[1:14:46] wages. seem like the pastor is not
[1:14:50] divinely called anymore. Just seem like
[1:14:53] it's being
[1:14:56] is beginning to be a me ticket to be a
[1:14:58] pastor
[1:15:01] that the people wherever offer him the
[1:15:05] most money that where he goes. It
[1:15:08] shouldn't be that way.
[1:15:11] It should be that a man was called of
[1:15:16] God to a community.
[1:15:21] Praise the Lord. When a man was called
[1:15:24] of God, he was called of God to a
[1:15:28] community.
[1:15:29] Praise the Lord. Amen. And uh in one
[1:15:33] sense, the church stands as a
[1:15:36] lighthouse. Jesus says you are a candle
[1:15:39] that is on the hill that I mean that is
[1:15:41] to the community. But what is the
[1:15:43] community that the man is called to to
[1:15:45] the people that are gathered by the
[1:15:47] word?
[1:15:49] Are we together? Amen. To the people
[1:15:53] that are gathered by the word. So it is
[1:15:56] not just a career. It is not just that
[1:15:59] he's employed but he's called to this
[1:16:02] community
[1:16:04] to become part of the community to
[1:16:06] govern the community by the word of God.
[1:16:10] Are we together? Now I will tell you why
[1:16:13] I'm I'm going in this direction
[1:16:17] and the reason is because there are some
[1:16:19] of the things uh kind of influence our
[1:16:22] uh us uh encouraging these young people
[1:16:25] to go out and I think uh we need to do
[1:16:28] more of it is because
[1:16:31] uh just like I said if you realize we
[1:16:34] don't have a big community of people
[1:16:36] that share the same value.
[1:16:40] Amen. We don't have a big community of
[1:16:42] that.
[1:16:45] And uh and and and and being a young
[1:16:47] church, we having uh new couples, we
[1:16:50] having children being born, we having
[1:16:52] teenagers, we having young adults. And
[1:16:56] and uh and you know, if if you don't
[1:16:59] have a community of the same value,
[1:17:03] pretty soon your your your children are
[1:17:06] going to be sneaking out. They are going
[1:17:09] to be wanting to associate because we
[1:17:12] are social creature. We have to
[1:17:14] associate.
[1:17:16] Praise the Lord. And the thing that
[1:17:18] happens in community is that uh we we
[1:17:22] communicate in community. We challenge
[1:17:24] one another or we encourage one another
[1:17:27] in community. Amen. As we as we hold up
[1:17:30] our same our same value.
[1:17:34] Praise the Lord. And uh uh uh uh so uh
[1:17:39] like like all of these youth camp and
[1:17:41] you know and and and conventions and all
[1:17:44] of these things they are beautiful
[1:17:46] because you go among people that have
[1:17:49] the same value. Amen. And then pretty
[1:17:52] soon you start beginning to appreciate
[1:17:55] what you have in your little group in
[1:17:58] your home you know and and the effort
[1:18:00] you are making to instruct your family
[1:18:02] according to the word of God. you starts
[1:18:05] to appreciate it and even your children
[1:18:07] starts to appreciate you know uh all the
[1:18:10] instruction you are giving him. Why?
[1:18:12] Because they have seen people of the
[1:18:15] same value. They have seen people that
[1:18:17] holds the same thing you know uh uh uh
[1:18:20] uh you know try to to to live the same
[1:18:22] way they live, dress the same way they
[1:18:24] dress and and all of that. Praise the
[1:18:26] Lord. But if we just stay in our homes,
[1:18:30] you know, and and and we and we preach
[1:18:32] all of these things to our children, we
[1:18:34] try to, you know, instruct them how to
[1:18:36] dress modestly according to the
[1:18:38] scripture, you know, we preach to them,
[1:18:40] you know, a woman must not wear that
[1:18:42] which pertinent onto a man. There is a
[1:18:44] godly way to dress, you know, and and
[1:18:46] decent way to dress. We try to teach all
[1:18:48] of that. But if the only thing they see
[1:18:50] is what they see in school,
[1:18:55] praise the Lord, they just think that
[1:18:57] what planet are we from?
[1:19:01] What planet are we from? Are my parents
[1:19:04] just making this?
[1:19:07] You see, that's that's that's the reason
[1:19:09] why community is good.
[1:19:13] So when God called a man,
[1:19:16] it's not for the me ticket. is now for
[1:19:19] wages.
[1:19:21] He call a man to a community.
[1:19:26] Praise the Lord. And until the man can
[1:19:29] be able to get that vision, he won't
[1:19:31] have the burden to work with the people.
[1:19:36] Are we together?
[1:19:42] Let's take another thing again here.
[1:19:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:52] Praise the Lord. Jesus Christ the same.
[1:19:55] what what whatever more your church
[1:19:59] represent all that that it represent in
[1:20:02] Christ that's what we represent to you
[1:20:05] brothers and we are here to help you to
[1:20:09] make this as uh uh brother Edward uh
[1:20:14] Kather used to say a community in which
[1:20:18] is easier to do the right and harder to
[1:20:24] do the strong.
[1:20:26] That's what the church is. That's why we
[1:20:29] create the atmosphere. That's why we
[1:20:31] encourage one another to make it easy
[1:20:34] for us to do the right thing and harder
[1:20:38] to do the wrong thing.
[1:20:40] Are we together? Praise the Lord. That
[1:20:44] sometime that's the reason why sometime
[1:20:45] the preacher has to preach with our
[1:20:47] gloves on his hands. He has to bring the
[1:20:49] word of God uh h uh you know uh uh uh
[1:20:53] hard as if he's angry at you. But what
[1:20:56] we trying to do is to better our
[1:20:58] community
[1:21:01] to make it easy for us to uphold our
[1:21:04] values
[1:21:08] because if uh if we if if if we don't
[1:21:13] set a standard to hold godly value, this
[1:21:16] is just an association.
[1:21:20] It's just an association. We just come,
[1:21:22] we associate together and everybody goes
[1:21:25] with their their own ideas,
[1:21:28] you know, and we we we just do whatever
[1:21:30] we want to do. Sonic comes, we come, we
[1:21:33] associate, we sing, we dance around and
[1:21:35] uh and and we make our contributions and
[1:21:38] then we just go home. It will just be an
[1:21:40] association. And our association is just
[1:21:42] good as a dead cuffs that is dressed
[1:21:47] in a coffin, but there is no life in it.
[1:21:50] It has all the jewelries on it is is
[1:21:52] painted well. It's put on expensive
[1:21:54] clothes. But there is no life on that
[1:21:57] cuff that is lying in the coffin. That's
[1:22:00] what an association is.
[1:22:06] So, so God's purpose for the church,
[1:22:10] you look, you look right through the Old
[1:22:12] Testament, you will see God laying out
[1:22:18] patterns. He's laying out uh uh uh in
[1:22:21] types and shadow his very purpose for
[1:22:25] these people that will be a call out
[1:22:27] people.
[1:22:30] He told Moses there in Exodus chapter
[1:22:32] 25, I want to make you h a royal
[1:22:36] priesthood. I want to make you know I I
[1:22:39] want I want you to be a family of
[1:22:42] priests.
[1:22:45] Are we together? God expressing his
[1:22:48] desire.
[1:22:50] Why he bring us together? Why are we
[1:22:52] here?
[1:22:55] It's not just to do our religion.
[1:22:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:03] It's not enough. If it is just to do our
[1:23:06] religion, spend an hour in church, you
[1:23:08] know, uh uh uh uh just to fulfill that
[1:23:10] we went to church on Sunday. It it's not
[1:23:13] enough.
[1:23:19] He says, "I will build my church and the
[1:23:24] gates of hell will not prevail against
[1:23:27] it. I'm going to bring failing a falling
[1:23:31] people. I'm going to bring people with
[1:23:33] problems. I'm going to bring I'm going
[1:23:34] to call people with struggles. I'm going
[1:23:37] to I'm going to deal with people that
[1:23:39] have terrible h past. But when I bring
[1:23:42] them together and my spirit in their
[1:23:45] midst, the gates of hell will come, but
[1:23:48] the gates of hell will not prevail.
[1:23:54] Praise the Lord. Amen. And that's the
[1:23:58] reason why sometimes we feel we feel
[1:24:00] forsaken.
[1:24:02] Why have thou forsaken me? Why me, Lord?
[1:24:05] Why? Why only me?
[1:24:09] It's all because he he has us on the
[1:24:14] wheel.
[1:24:16] Praise the Lord. He has us on the wheel
[1:24:19] trying to bring us to that purpose,
[1:24:22] trying to bring us to be able to to see
[1:24:25] is not uh one family being better than
[1:24:27] another family or you know uh one one
[1:24:30] class. No, there's no class among God's
[1:24:32] people. We are all God's children.
[1:24:44] And what he want to do is to be able to
[1:24:46] use each and every one of us, our our
[1:24:48] our individual lives, our individual
[1:24:51] family to be able to declare his name,
[1:24:57] to make his name known. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:01] And sometimes the people
[1:25:04] don't really get the vision. and they
[1:25:06] don't get they don't get the purpose at
[1:25:07] all. Sometimes we we become so selfish
[1:25:11] because we just want it the way that is
[1:25:14] for us.
[1:25:21] Are we together?
[1:25:31] Science science says science prove that
[1:25:34] uh the environment that we live in has
[1:25:38] 98% influence on us.
[1:25:42] The environment we live in the community
[1:25:45] we live in I'm speaking on community.
[1:25:48] The church has a community has 98%
[1:25:52] of influence on us. Now, so think about
[1:25:56] it this way. Many of us that that that
[1:25:59] grew up in uh in in different churches
[1:26:01] and ran from one church to another
[1:26:03] church seeking truth. All of those
[1:26:06] church have one impact or another on our
[1:26:09] life. Amen. So whenever we come into a
[1:26:13] church, first we start to draw that
[1:26:17] trust through the filter of what we know
[1:26:20] as a church.
[1:26:22] Then we ask ourselves why they do this
[1:26:24] this the way why they sing this way and
[1:26:27] and I mean they don't do things like the
[1:26:29] way we used to. All you doing is that
[1:26:31] you are drawing this group through the
[1:26:34] filter of what you know as a church.
[1:26:38] Amen. But we but I'll say to you don't
[1:26:41] judge don't be inherit you just wait a
[1:26:43] little bit.
[1:26:45] Praise the Lord. If God call you to be
[1:26:48] part of this community to help us raise
[1:26:50] up the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:26:52] you will soon grab the vision. Amen. You
[1:26:54] will soon get the purpose why we are
[1:26:56] here.
[1:27:02] So with with all of this uh uh influence
[1:27:05] that we have had it it it brings it a it
[1:27:08] create an uh uh uh uh confusion within
[1:27:12] us. Let me say it that way.
[1:27:17] And then but by little by little the
[1:27:19] Lord start dealing with us. You see
[1:27:20] that's the reason why I always say as a
[1:27:22] church we invest on our atmosphere. We
[1:27:25] don't want nothing tempering with our
[1:27:27] atmosphere. Amen. We don't want no
[1:27:29] judging spirit. We don't want no gossip.
[1:27:32] We don't want uh and that's the reason
[1:27:33] why the prophet of God taught us to come
[1:27:35] to church, you know, and have that time
[1:27:37] to pray and wait on the Lord and clear
[1:27:40] our spirit because it is the atmosphere
[1:27:42] that brings the result.
[1:27:47] A person comes into into our midst, it
[1:27:50] all looks different from the way they
[1:27:51] know a church supposed to be. But the
[1:27:53] Holy Ghost, if we give the Holy Ghost
[1:27:55] the right of way and the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:58] moving, he's the one that brings
[1:28:00] conviction. He's the one that brings
[1:28:02] understanding. He's the one that change
[1:28:04] people life. And before you realize the
[1:28:07] person say, "Oh, wow. I mean, it's not
[1:28:08] like what I knew, but I like what I'm
[1:28:10] seeing. I I think that is the word of
[1:28:12] God. I feel the presence of God.
[1:28:21] Are we together?
[1:28:28] Let's read this. Abraham Lincoln
[1:28:32] influence of another Abraham Lincoln.
[1:28:35] Now
[1:28:37] what he was a godly man
[1:28:40] and he was raised
[1:28:43] to serve God and he said if there's
[1:28:48] anything that I want to give praise to.
[1:28:52] He said, "Oh, my life was influenced by
[1:28:56] was a godly mother who taught me
[1:29:01] to pray and to know Jesus as my savior."
[1:29:06] Oh, our family
[1:29:09] what you are. Oh, your family what you
[1:29:13] are.
[1:29:15] You raise your your child in a certain
[1:29:18] environment.
[1:29:19] It got 98%
[1:29:21] better chance to go right than it has
[1:29:27] to if you bring bring it up in the wrong
[1:29:32] way. Amen. If the child is brought up in
[1:29:37] the right environment, it has 98%
[1:29:41] chance to go right.
[1:29:46] Are we together?
[1:29:52] Bring up a child in the way that it
[1:29:54] should go and when it gets old it will
[1:29:56] not depart.
[1:29:59] Be brought a right. Teach your children
[1:30:02] to do right to be earnest to be squared
[1:30:06] and fed
[1:30:08] even when they are in school.
[1:30:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:13] Amen.
[1:30:16] You realize that
[1:30:18] we living in a society
[1:30:21] where
[1:30:24] our children are learning more from
[1:30:25] school than learning from home.
[1:30:31] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:36] They're learning more from school.
[1:30:38] They're learning from home because they
[1:30:40] spend much time in school and spend more
[1:30:43] time with a with a teacher that has
[1:30:46] their own aware and the way they see
[1:30:48] things and because they want to impart
[1:30:50] that child. They are making every effort
[1:30:54] to change certain habit and change
[1:30:56] certain things in the child. Why you
[1:30:58] always dress this way? Why you talk this
[1:31:00] way?
[1:31:02] And then we have busy parents.
[1:31:07] We don't mean to but we are busy
[1:31:12] and we don't spend that much time.
[1:31:15] So what is happening here?
[1:31:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:21] You say something to the to the child.
[1:31:23] The child said, "No, that's not what my
[1:31:24] teacher said."
[1:31:30] We're talking about community. I I'm I'm
[1:31:32] just trying to to wake you up a little
[1:31:34] bit here. Amen. I'm trying to find a
[1:31:36] place where I can drill the nail. Amen.
[1:31:42] Says, "No, that's not what my teacher
[1:31:43] said." And and then he says, "Well, I
[1:31:45] I'm I'm not your teacher. I'm your
[1:31:47] parent, you know." And then you're
[1:31:48] getting into a little But what is
[1:31:49] happening just just by that statement
[1:31:52] just by that statement is just telling
[1:31:54] you that uh uh uh uh there is more
[1:31:59] influence on the other side than this
[1:32:02] side.
[1:32:05] Praise the Lord. Amen. You see, because
[1:32:09] I call into the word of God Deuteronomy
[1:32:11] chapter 6, the parents are instructed to
[1:32:15] teach their children when it comes to
[1:32:17] teaching. Amen.
[1:32:20] Which mean uh uh uh mannerism and ethics
[1:32:24] and dress code.
[1:32:27] The society must not be teaching our
[1:32:29] children how to dress.
[1:32:32] They must not be learning it from
[1:32:34] YouTube and Tik Tok. They must be
[1:32:35] learning it from home.
[1:32:40] They must be learning it from uh from
[1:32:43] us. The way they see us dress, the the
[1:32:46] way they see us talk, our mannerism.
[1:32:50] That's why Moses taught the children.
[1:32:52] Let these things uh be taught to your
[1:32:54] children. Let it be written on your
[1:32:56] walls. When they when they when they
[1:32:57] when they look at your walls, let it see
[1:33:00] an instruction. child, obey your parent.
[1:33:02] They see it on the wall. It speaks to
[1:33:04] them every time they read it.
[1:33:10] Amen.
[1:33:11] We send them to school for them to be
[1:33:13] educated in a sense find a path to a
[1:33:17] career. That's why they go to school
[1:33:19] for. But when it comes to teaching,
[1:33:22] we must do the teaching.
[1:33:28] Are we together?
[1:33:31] They must be taught in our community.
[1:33:43] Are we together?
[1:33:45] Listen to this. A shame of him.
[1:33:50] nations are broke up way back in the
[1:33:53] jungle of Africa
[1:33:56] on uh on uh safari hunters. They had to
[1:34:01] take
[1:34:02] high power radio to hear Ever Presley
[1:34:05] Pone and them guys with that rock and
[1:34:08] roll and twist and the natives trying to
[1:34:12] see them at alone jacking their head
[1:34:16] acting like that. The native stood and
[1:34:20] look at it. But you see they are not
[1:34:23] Americans like Pat Bone or or Ever
[1:34:26] Presley and uh Ricky Nelson and them
[1:34:29] guys
[1:34:31] are praise the Lord. Now this this is
[1:34:34] what this is where this the context here
[1:34:37] is is in a place where Western music is
[1:34:40] affecting the word. They don't have to
[1:34:42] be in America to learn how to sack their
[1:34:45] pants.
[1:34:48] They don't have to be in America to
[1:34:49] learn how to move their hairs like this.
[1:34:52] It's the spirit of the music.
[1:34:56] And because they are in that environment
[1:34:58] of the music, the spirit get a hold of
[1:35:00] them and they are jacking their heads.
[1:35:04] They don't even know who sang the music.
[1:35:06] They never been to the concert.
[1:35:09] But because they are in that
[1:35:10] environment,
[1:35:15] are you seeing where I'm going with
[1:35:17] that?
[1:35:23] Pat Bone, Ever Presley, Raiky Nelson,
[1:35:25] them guys, they are uh uh uh they are
[1:35:29] not Judases of that type. See, it's a
[1:35:33] spirit.
[1:35:35] And the spirit is not only in America,
[1:35:38] it spread itself out over the world to
[1:35:42] bring them to the battle of Amagida,
[1:35:47] blasting their heads.
[1:35:51] It just it has to be a music that that
[1:35:53] that blast their heads,
[1:35:58] but it's a spirit.
[1:36:01] Are we together?
[1:36:07] They are like that.
[1:36:12] Whatever nations they come from, Africa,
[1:36:14] India, wherever it is, that vulgar
[1:36:19] and stuff has spread over the earth.
[1:36:23] But just one man started it.
[1:36:28] So has the gospel and the power of
[1:36:30] almighty God has spread around the
[1:36:33] world. Amen.
[1:36:38] And the time of separation is now taking
[1:36:40] place. God is is calling the bride. The
[1:36:42] devil is calling the church. Let's be
[1:36:45] part of the bride. Amen.
[1:36:47] Are we together? Are you seeing where
[1:36:50] I'm going with this? Amen.
[1:36:53] The environment,
[1:36:55] the community is all the same.
[1:36:59] The environment, the community
[1:37:04] has an influence.
[1:37:08] Praise the Lord. It has an influence.
[1:37:11] And uh uh uh and I mean in in all of
[1:37:14] these things you you you find you know
[1:37:17] uh uh you find uh even bunch of uh young
[1:37:19] people that that term tends to believe
[1:37:22] that there is something called Christian
[1:37:24] rap.
[1:37:27] Praise the Lord. It's not it's not only
[1:37:29] the wordings.
[1:37:32] It's not just the wordings of the song.
[1:37:39] Statistics are show us how
[1:37:42] All of the the the the gang movement
[1:37:45] that is rising up in young people has
[1:37:48] been influenced by the music that they
[1:37:51] listen to, with the insults and uh uh uh
[1:37:56] uh uh blow his head up and and all of
[1:37:59] those things that they listen to. They
[1:38:01] feed their mind, you know, with those
[1:38:03] things. It condition them.
[1:38:10] Are we together
[1:38:15] preparing their mind
[1:38:17] for amid
[1:38:20] now? So uh uh uh when when when you
[1:38:23] think about this and then you start to
[1:38:27] appreciate
[1:38:29] the purpose of the church.
[1:38:32] Society has gone by because the church
[1:38:35] has failed on her purpose. We have we
[1:38:38] have paid much attention to building
[1:38:41] denomination, mega church and and
[1:38:44] building names and building wealth for
[1:38:46] ourself that we we we we have not paid
[1:38:49] attention to be able to affect our
[1:38:52] community with the power of God where a
[1:38:56] people can come together and believe
[1:38:58] that God answer prayers.
[1:39:01] Praise the Lord. You know what it is
[1:39:04] when you start teaching your little
[1:39:05] children to believe that God answer
[1:39:07] prayers.
[1:39:11] You know what it is. You know how much
[1:39:13] you are empowering that child for the
[1:39:15] future. That when you are no longer
[1:39:16] around and they having trouble, they can
[1:39:19] go on their knees and cry to God.
[1:39:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:40] It's not just the the It's just It's not
[1:39:42] just the nice building.
[1:39:44] It's not the music.
[1:39:49] It's the value that we uphold.
[1:39:52] Praise the Lord. It's the thing that we
[1:39:55] are fighting for every time we come in
[1:39:58] this building. Every time we come
[1:40:00] together, the reason why we are here,
[1:40:02] the thing we are fighting for,
[1:40:10] but I'm glad he says, "I will build my
[1:40:12] church and the gifts of hell shall not
[1:40:15] prevail."
[1:40:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:25] Oh, what a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[1:40:28] Praise the Lord. You love the Lord.
[1:40:32] Amen. The Lord has been so good to us.
[1:40:36] Amen. He's been so so so good to us.
[1:40:40] God's people
[1:40:44] all through the ages,
[1:40:48] they have gone through one thing or
[1:40:50] another. Even even the Jews when you
[1:40:52] when you study the history of the Jews,
[1:40:57] it came to a time after after the the
[1:41:00] the Holocaust and all that the Jews has
[1:41:04] gone to. I mean uh uh uh they were they
[1:41:07] were trying to I mean just just to
[1:41:10] believe to go back and read the Torah
[1:41:13] and and and to and to be able to refer
[1:41:15] to one and says I am your God that have
[1:41:18] brought you out of Egypt. I mean when
[1:41:20] you look at things that you are going
[1:41:22] through and to be able to associate that
[1:41:27] with an almighty God and Elohim then you
[1:41:30] are asking I mean uh I mean so so so
[1:41:32] many of these Jews uh uh uh uh there's a
[1:41:36] documentary called uh uh God on trial
[1:41:39] and and it it was all about these Jews
[1:41:42] that were that were arguing with the
[1:41:44] rabb and and and trying to argue with
[1:41:46] him. All of these things you are telling
[1:41:48] us from the Torah. See what we are going
[1:41:50] through. Where is our God?
[1:41:56] Why have thou forsaken me?
[1:42:00] Where is our God?
[1:42:03] Why we have to go through all of this? I
[1:42:06] thought it should be very easy when I
[1:42:08] believe the Lord Jesus. I'm baptized in
[1:42:10] the name of the Lord Jesus. Everything
[1:42:12] should go easy.
[1:42:15] But God don't work like that.
[1:42:17] Praise the Lord. He don't work like
[1:42:20] that. Praise the Lord. He's just trying
[1:42:24] to tell you that no matter what you are
[1:42:26] going through, the gates of hell will
[1:42:28] not prevail.
[1:42:30] You will feel the flame. You will feel
[1:42:32] the pressure. But the gifts of hell will
[1:42:35] not prevail
[1:42:38] because this is my community. It's a
[1:42:41] community that bear my name.
[1:42:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:52] You see that in the life of Hega crying
[1:42:55] h
[1:42:57] crying for the child. You see that in
[1:43:00] the life of Moses h feeling the sense of
[1:43:03] rejection of his people.
[1:43:06] Why have thou forsaken me? Every one of
[1:43:09] us says the same thing. That's what
[1:43:11] brother Brandham was saying right here.
[1:43:12] He says this was David on a prophecy
[1:43:15] prophesying of of Jesus Christ. When he
[1:43:18] said it, it moved over to the church.
[1:43:24] Praise the Lord. So every one of us, we
[1:43:27] go through things and we say that very
[1:43:30] same language, why hast thou forsaken
[1:43:32] me?
[1:43:34] Because it's a breath cry of the church.
[1:43:38] And you know the beautiful thing about
[1:43:39] it when you say that it means that
[1:43:44] you are in connection.
[1:43:46] Amen.
[1:43:48] You are in connection with your
[1:43:49] umbilical.
[1:43:52] Praise the Lord. You are in connection
[1:43:55] with your umbilical. You know that there
[1:43:58] is a God. Amen. Whose help you need and
[1:44:03] you feel like he's forsaken. and then
[1:44:05] pray the song you start to see the
[1:44:08] beauty of it.
[1:44:19] Why have thou forsaken me?
[1:44:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:24] Paul says in 2 Corinthians chapter 4:9,
[1:44:27] "We are persecuted,
[1:44:30] but we are never forsaken.
[1:44:35] Praise the Lord. We are persecuted, but
[1:44:38] we are never forsaken.
[1:44:40] Glory be to God.
[1:44:42] Amen.
[1:44:45] Oh, I love this this morning. Amen.
[1:44:49] I love this this morning.
[1:44:54] Here's a church birth cry.
[1:44:57] It's our birth cry. We go through
[1:44:59] things. We say, "Oh God, where are you?
[1:45:03] It's the same thing. My God. My God. You
[1:45:05] are saying the same thing.
[1:45:08] You just speaking a different dialect,
[1:45:10] but it's the same thing you are saying.
[1:45:12] Amen. Oh God,
[1:45:16] make a way. Turn the situation around.
[1:45:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:23] You know what you're doing? You are just
[1:45:24] conditioning to be birthed.
[1:45:27] You are in the womb. You are
[1:45:29] conditioning
[1:45:30] to be birthed.
[1:45:32] That's all the child needs. Just the
[1:45:34] right environment.
[1:45:37] Amen. Unless the mama eat the right
[1:45:39] food, that baby is going to come forth.
[1:45:45] Are we together? Praise the Lord.
[1:45:48] Because we have to realize that uh uh uh
[1:45:52] uh I mean uh uh uh just like uh uh
[1:45:57] the scripture says here I love this uh
[1:46:01] 1st Samuel chapter 12 verse 22. For the
[1:46:04] Lord will not forsake his people for his
[1:46:07] great name's sake.
[1:46:11] Amen.
[1:46:15] For his name's sake.
[1:46:17] because
[1:46:19] it has pleased the Lord
[1:46:22] to make you his people.
[1:46:27] Praise the Lord. He could have called
[1:46:29] other people. He could have revealed
[1:46:32] himself to them, but it pleased the Lord
[1:46:36] to make you hate. And because of his
[1:46:39] name's sake, he will never forsake you.
[1:46:50] But sometimes we just need to understand
[1:46:53] what's the purpose.
[1:46:56] What is the purpose? Praise the Lord.
[1:47:00] Now remember when uh when uh uh uh uh
[1:47:03] Solomon was building uh uh the temple,
[1:47:07] you know, they had all of these stones
[1:47:09] that were you know that were gathered
[1:47:10] from many different nation marbles and
[1:47:13] you know uh uh diamonds and then all the
[1:47:17] all the the you know elements of the
[1:47:19] earth. I mean, he had all of these
[1:47:21] beautiful things gathered,
[1:47:23] brought from everywhere.
[1:47:26] And yet they had to get
[1:47:29] uh
[1:47:31] a stone missing in to be able to chip
[1:47:34] those stones
[1:47:36] for them to be able to fit.
[1:47:39] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:47:42] And all of those stones were cut from
[1:47:46] different places. And that is and that
[1:47:48] is the way our natural birth is. We are
[1:47:52] caught from different places, cut from
[1:47:54] different things that we've gone
[1:47:55] through. And here are h are ships
[1:47:59] transporting these stones over. But
[1:48:02] every stone had a place in the
[1:48:05] tabernacle.
[1:48:09] Praise the Lord. That the Bible recorded
[1:48:12] that in the building of the temple there
[1:48:14] was not a sound of a hmon.
[1:48:18] because every stone was cut right to be
[1:48:22] able to fit right in.
[1:48:26] There was not a sound of a harmon.
[1:48:29] So you see when God take us through
[1:48:31] these things, he's cutting us. He's
[1:48:35] shaping us so we can fit right into our
[1:48:39] place in the body.
[1:48:46] Are we together?
[1:48:53] You see when when uh when the people of
[1:48:56] God begin to understand the purpose of
[1:49:00] redemption, the purpose of the church,
[1:49:03] then it gets to the place where
[1:49:07] the church don't become brother W's
[1:49:10] church.
[1:49:13] No.
[1:49:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:21] You know, this morning I was studying.
[1:49:25] I was looking I was looking for a sound
[1:49:28] that I wanted to put in my notes. Just
[1:49:30] print it out. And if you if you if you
[1:49:34] see something, say something.
[1:49:40] Have you Have you seen that sign?
[1:49:43] Have you seen that sign?
[1:49:46] I I saw a few of them and I trying I was
[1:49:49] trying hard working this morning hard to
[1:49:51] to to work on the words and and make it
[1:49:54] nice. I was not able to finish it
[1:49:55] because of some of the things that I
[1:49:57] needed to do. But I was I was just
[1:50:00] enjoying myself doing that.
[1:50:03] Praise the Lord. If you see something,
[1:50:05] say something.
[1:50:07] if you see something, you know, uh uh
[1:50:10] one of uh uh the on it says uh uh
[1:50:17] I forget what it said. Let me let me
[1:50:20] just stay with what I'm talking about
[1:50:21] this morning. Amen. From my mind start
[1:50:23] going into all of that. But you see
[1:50:25] that's that's that's what Paul says.
[1:50:27] Let's provoke one another
[1:50:30] to good works. Why? Because it's to the
[1:50:34] benefit of our community. Amen.
[1:50:38] is to the benefit of our community.
[1:50:45] I mean, we don't we don't we don't tear
[1:50:46] one another down and destroy one
[1:50:50] another, you know, in our homes with
[1:50:51] with talks and gossip and all of that.
[1:50:53] No,
[1:50:56] we pray for one another. Amen. We
[1:51:00] encourage one another.
[1:51:04] That's what we supposed to do. That's
[1:51:06] what the church supposed to do.
[1:51:09] That's the thing that uh you know uh uh
[1:51:12] uh uh uh improve our our community. Can
[1:51:14] can you imagine those days of of of of
[1:51:17] farming
[1:51:19] when men live on the earth?
[1:51:22] I mean the community the the the rally
[1:51:25] together to make sure that uh you know
[1:51:27] uh brother brother Steve Farm is is is
[1:51:30] cut down. You know, last time is is is
[1:51:32] is blessing time to go. Uh next uh
[1:51:35] Saturday we go and make sure that
[1:51:36] blessings. Can you imagine uh uh uh uh
[1:51:40] how the family will have failed if
[1:51:42] everybody was supposed to just cut down
[1:51:45] their own acres.
[1:51:47] I mean they will be brushing and
[1:51:48] brushing and then planting time will
[1:51:51] pass. But those men uh uh the the the
[1:51:54] they unite their strength together and I
[1:51:56] mean everybody is on the schedule you
[1:51:58] know while the wife is getting the
[1:52:00] children ready let's cook they coming to
[1:52:02] it's our time for our farm to be brushed
[1:52:05] today I mean the men are coming here
[1:52:06] today everybody's ready
[1:52:11] and before you realize that community
[1:52:13] have surplus
[1:52:17] praise the lord
[1:52:20] but brother says we live in a time where
[1:52:22] you don't even know your neighbor is
[1:52:23] dead until uh you don't know he's sick
[1:52:25] until that you heard that he's dead
[1:52:33] because we don't even go across the
[1:52:34] street to see who's living there. We
[1:52:36] don't even say hi to the next person
[1:52:37] there. And I mean uh uh uh and and that
[1:52:40] is some of the things and most of the
[1:52:42] things that have destroyed our society.
[1:52:46] They have taken the common sense of
[1:52:48] human value from us. We don't care is
[1:52:50] their problem is up to them. Let them
[1:52:53] sort it out.
[1:53:02] Praise the Lord. It's either that or or
[1:53:05] it's a rag race. This other family
[1:53:08] brought a 15 inch uh in. Let's go and
[1:53:11] get 22.
[1:53:13] There is louder. Let's bump our own.
[1:53:15] Let's get more louder.
[1:53:19] And at the end of the day, nobody is
[1:53:21] watching anything.
[1:53:28] Are we together?
[1:53:31] Oh, praise the Lord. What a mighty God
[1:53:32] we serve. Amen. What a mighty God we
[1:53:36] serve.
[1:53:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:41] What a mighty God we serve. The Lord is
[1:53:44] so good
[1:53:46] and his mercy endureth forever.
[1:53:53] Besetting of God. So I believe that the
[1:53:56] influence that music put upon children,
[1:54:00] it will pay every Christian
[1:54:03] throughout radio land
[1:54:06] that this radio reach to keep their
[1:54:08] radio turn in such a station as tonight.
[1:54:12] Okay. that was uh that was uh uh uh uh
[1:54:16] you know a radio station where brother
[1:54:18] Neville used to sing and preach on.
[1:54:20] That's what he's kind of referring to.
[1:54:23] And uh but I just I just took that uh to
[1:54:26] make the emphasis of how much influence
[1:54:29] music put upon children
[1:54:32] to keep their radio turn into such a
[1:54:35] station as this because it brings the
[1:54:37] right kind of a influence through music
[1:54:40] and through preaching the word to our
[1:54:43] children.
[1:54:45] It set them in a better
[1:54:49] environment.
[1:54:51] Praise the Lord. Amen. It set them in a
[1:54:55] better environment. So, how do we stay
[1:54:58] in our community? We don't all have to
[1:55:00] move to Brooklyn Center and leave.
[1:55:03] Our community is the word.
[1:55:06] Amen. It's the word. Because when you
[1:55:10] are reading the word and I'm reading the
[1:55:12] word, we are staying in our community.
[1:55:14] Pretty soon we are saying the same
[1:55:16] thing. And I say that, "Oh yeah, I just
[1:55:19] read that this morning.
[1:55:24] So he says by by by by by by by by by
[1:55:27] listening to h
[1:55:29] godly music and the preaching of the
[1:55:31] word
[1:55:33] it set our community.
[1:55:36] It set them in a better community.
[1:55:39] Why? Because it's all about the mind.
[1:55:44] It's all about the spirit man.
[1:55:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:50] is all about the spirit man.
[1:55:55] Because of the failure of the church and
[1:55:57] and and all the horrible thing we have
[1:55:59] seen all the abuses and corruption, it
[1:56:02] have put such such a stigma on church
[1:56:06] that people just see well it's just all
[1:56:08] about the money business. It has
[1:56:09] destroyed the value.
[1:56:13] Praise the Lord
[1:56:16] that yeah, you know, uh, it's I can
[1:56:19] serve God in my heart. The church is the
[1:56:22] person. It's not the building. It's
[1:56:24] truth. It's not the building.
[1:56:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:30] But if you have a community, there's a
[1:56:32] there's a place where the neighbors
[1:56:33] should meet. That's why every community
[1:56:36] has a park.
[1:56:39] Praise the Lord. This is our community.
[1:56:41] This is our park. We come here to dance
[1:56:44] to the Lord. We come here to praise the
[1:56:45] Lord. We come here to speak about things
[1:56:48] that concern us.
[1:57:02] You love the Lord.
[1:57:09] Oh, what a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[1:57:26] Now last week uh when I was speaking u I
[1:57:30] kind of for misuse I misplace the
[1:57:33] quotation and I thought that I will
[1:57:35] correct it this morning. Let's look at
[1:57:37] Psalm chapter 16.
[1:57:41] I misplaced a quotation
[1:57:45] when we read Psalm 22 last week. Uh I
[1:57:50] used that in place of this that we
[1:57:52] coming to read and uh I you know I spoke
[1:57:56] about uh uh
[1:58:02] Psalm chapter 16. Let's go there. And uh
[1:58:18] praise the Lord. Yes. Yes. David again.
[1:58:21] Uh uh uh uh
[1:58:25] David again in prayer.
[1:58:29] Psalm chapter 16. Pre preserve me, oh
[1:58:32] God, for indeed do I put my trust, oh my
[1:58:35] soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, thou
[1:58:39] are my Lord, my uh uh my goodness
[1:58:43] extended not to thee, but to the saints
[1:58:48] thou to the saints that are in the
[1:58:50] earth, and to the excellent in whom is
[1:58:54] all mine delight. Praise the Lord. Their
[1:58:58] sorrows shall be multiplied.
[1:59:01] Uh the hastening after another god.
[1:59:06] Their drink offering of blood will I not
[1:59:10] offer none thick up their names into my
[1:59:14] lips. Now this is where I want to go
[1:59:16] with with all of this that we are
[1:59:18] reading.
[1:59:23] Let's uh go to verse seven. I will bless
[1:59:26] the Lord who has given me counsel. My
[1:59:29] reigns are also instruct me in the night
[1:59:32] season. I have set the Lord always
[1:59:35] before me. Because he is at my right
[1:59:38] hand, I shall not be moved.
[1:59:42] Therefore, my heart is glad and my glory
[1:59:47] rejoice. My flesh also shall rest in
[1:59:50] hope. For thou shalt not leave my soul
[1:59:55] in hell.
[1:59:57] Praise the Lord. Now read this and think
[2:00:01] about Jesus saying the gates of hell
[2:00:05] shall not prevail.
[2:00:08] Amen.
[2:00:11] You just you just just just make that
[2:00:13] comparison in your mind. Now David is
[2:00:16] saying here therefore my heart is glad
[2:00:20] uh uh uh uh and uh
[2:00:24] my heart is glad and my glory rejoice.
[2:00:27] My flesh also shall rest in hope. For
[2:00:30] thou shalt not leave my soul in hell,
[2:00:33] neither will thou suffer thy holy one to
[2:00:37] see corruption.
[2:00:42] Thou will show me the path of life.
[2:00:46] In thy presence is fullness of joy.
[2:00:50] At the right hand there are pleasures
[2:00:53] forever more. Praise the Lord. So last
[2:00:57] week when I referred to the verse,
[2:01:01] the only verse that our Lord Jesus
[2:01:04] Christ hang the only verse in scripture
[2:01:09] because you have to realize that after
[2:01:11] Jesus died on the cross, there was there
[2:01:15] was a there was a three-day span.
[2:01:18] Praise the Lord. And Peter will tell us
[2:01:21] in the book of Peter that he went down
[2:01:23] and preached to souls in prison.
[2:01:29] Praise the Lord. Amen. So his spirit
[2:01:33] went back to God. His soul went down to
[2:01:35] hell.
[2:01:36] Why? Because he was bolding our sin upon
[2:01:40] him.
[2:01:43] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:46] There had to be a word. There had to be
[2:01:48] a prophecy.
[2:01:51] He said, "Uh, I destroy this temple and
[2:01:53] in three days I will raise it up."
[2:01:58] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:02] And yet David prophesied and saying that
[2:02:06] will not leave his soul in hell, neither
[2:02:09] will you allowed
[2:02:11] him to see corruption.
[2:02:15] And that was the only verse brother
[2:02:17] Brandon says here. He says a prophecy of
[2:02:20] a backslider preacher
[2:02:24] yet in the message position
[2:02:28] uh uh uh of a believer in Christ. And so
[2:02:30] it was Christ being represented for the
[2:02:33] church. He took the church place of sin
[2:02:37] and was cast into utter darkness into
[2:02:40] hell. He rose again the third day. God
[2:02:43] raised him up for our justification. And
[2:02:46] he did that on the basis of one
[2:02:49] scripture of a minister who later
[2:02:52] backslided spoke in the scripture. David
[2:02:55] said, "I will not leave his soul in
[2:02:58] hell. Neither will I suffer my holy one
[2:03:02] to see corruption."
[2:03:06] The only scripture I find in the Old
[2:03:08] Testament spoke by by prophecy that God
[2:03:12] was going to do it.
[2:03:17] So he did not leave his soul in hell.
[2:03:21] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:24] Amen.
[2:03:27] I will leave his soul in hell and I will
[2:03:30] not allow my holy one to see corruption.
[2:03:35] So he has to come up before 3 days
[2:03:38] because 72 hours corruption set in the
[2:03:41] body.
[2:03:42] So he had to come up. He had to he had
[2:03:45] to skip hell because there was a word.
[2:03:49] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:52] Amen.
[2:03:55] So you see it and yet Jesus in the
[2:03:58] infancy of the church in the infancy
[2:04:01] when all the disciples know was just the
[2:04:03] synagogues the temple of Solomon and all
[2:04:06] of that and he's standing right in the
[2:04:08] midst of them and says I will build my
[2:04:10] church
[2:04:14] praise the Lord
[2:04:16] when he asked the disciple Matthew
[2:04:18] chapter 16 who do men say that I the son
[2:04:21] of man I
[2:04:24] Some say you are Jeremiah. Some say you
[2:04:26] are this. He say okay. It's okay. Who do
[2:04:28] you say I am?
[2:04:31] Praise the Lord. We've been we've been
[2:04:33] coming together a whole while now.
[2:04:36] What's what you think of me? Praise the
[2:04:39] Lord.
[2:04:41] I I don't believe that they were
[2:04:43] doubting him.
[2:04:46] I believe that they were they were they
[2:04:47] were so overwhelmed with all the
[2:04:49] manifestation that they have seen that
[2:04:52] uh I mean they the reality couldn't put
[2:04:54] in words
[2:04:55] they were somehow brain frozen
[2:04:59] praise the lord
[2:05:01] and the revelation just dropped down in
[2:05:03] Peter heart he said thou art Christ son
[2:05:06] of the living God
[2:05:09] and Jesus said flesh and blood did not
[2:05:11] give this to you he didn't learn it in
[2:05:12] school my father just gave give you a
[2:05:15] revelation and upon this rock the rock
[2:05:19] of revelation I will build my church.
[2:05:24] Praise the Lord. Amen. The rock of
[2:05:27] revelation where where God can be able
[2:05:31] to release his thoughts to his children.
[2:05:34] When God can be able to take you beyond
[2:05:36] what the preacher is saying, he can be
[2:05:39] able to take you into the realness of
[2:05:41] his presence.
[2:05:46] Praise the Lord. So you see how powerful
[2:05:49] our community is when we are influenced
[2:05:52] by revelation.
[2:05:55] Not I7, not man pleasing, not
[2:05:58] competition, but God dealing with us in
[2:06:01] our measure. Praise the Lord. He's
[2:06:04] dealing with us in our measure. We
[2:06:06] loving him for that. We appreciating one
[2:06:08] another.
[2:06:11] when the church is governed by
[2:06:12] revelation.
[2:06:17] But it's not always like that.
[2:06:21] Amen. You check the book of Acts when
[2:06:24] when when Simon the sorceress, he start
[2:06:26] to see what the disciples were doing, he
[2:06:29] got carried away
[2:06:32] and he wanted the power. He says, "How
[2:06:33] much can I pay?"
[2:06:37] Praise the Lord. He just started
[2:06:39] something that you got to go sit down
[2:06:40] with Peter. Let he give you three three
[2:06:42] months of class.
[2:06:46] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:49] And Peter had to tell him, "You and your
[2:06:50] money go to hell."
[2:06:54] Praise the Lord. The Bible says that he
[2:06:57] brought all his magical books and all
[2:06:59] the things that he was he was reading
[2:07:01] and and all the things he was using. But
[2:07:04] if you study history, you study history,
[2:07:08] Simon the sorcerer gave the church a
[2:07:10] problem because he could never comes to
[2:07:13] true conviction. He was wanting power.
[2:07:16] He was wanting to rise to the place of
[2:07:20] influence. You see when man had go has
[2:07:23] got into into all of these big powers
[2:07:26] and and political powers and they have
[2:07:28] made name for themsel.
[2:07:31] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:33] Even when they come when they come into
[2:07:35] God's community, they come into the
[2:07:37] church, they want a special place. You
[2:07:39] must set them down. You know, their name
[2:07:41] must always be called. You must mention
[2:07:43] their name. And you know, you should
[2:07:45] just be throwing flowers for what? We
[2:07:47] have only one person to be praised.
[2:07:49] That's almighty God.
[2:07:56] Praise the Lord. He could never come to
[2:07:59] true conviction.
[2:08:01] He struggled with that.
[2:08:04] Because here say he was he was a
[2:08:06] sorcerer. He was a magician that people
[2:08:08] were coming toward and and you were
[2:08:10] giving them answers. Now he have seen
[2:08:12] the power the demonstration of the of of
[2:08:14] God on the scene.
[2:08:17] Okay, I can join this church.
[2:08:21] Maybe they will give me position.
[2:08:26] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:28] Amen.
[2:08:31] Acts chapter 7
[2:08:34] or Acts chapter 6. Acts chapter 6
[2:08:37] actually.
[2:08:39] Seek you men among you filled with the
[2:08:41] Holy Ghost. That's the qualification for
[2:08:43] position. Amen. Seek men among you
[2:08:47] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:08:52] Are we together? Are you Are you Are you
[2:08:55] seeing what I'm laboring on this
[2:08:56] morning? Amen. And it's it's just it
[2:08:59] just is just to come to this place to
[2:09:01] say that uh
[2:09:06] uh your home, your family,
[2:09:09] they are your responsibility.
[2:09:12] Praise the Lord. Amen. They are your
[2:09:15] responsibility.
[2:09:18] By God's grace, we'll meet here
[2:09:19] Wednesday night and Sunday morning,
[2:09:22] unless we have a special meeting that
[2:09:25] sometimes we do Saturday night, Sunday
[2:09:26] morning. And uh uh or we have our
[2:09:30] communion service we do Sunday evening
[2:09:33] but our regular service is uh Wednesday
[2:09:36] night and and uh Sunday morning and the
[2:09:39] rest of the time we are at home at work
[2:09:42] you know as family we do our family
[2:09:43] thing.
[2:09:45] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:09:49] But
[2:09:51] I'm laboring to bring to you an an
[2:09:54] understanding this morning. And we we've
[2:09:57] seen that over and over sometimes I mean
[2:10:00] there are places where God has blessed
[2:10:02] the people with big community of
[2:10:05] believers. I mean there are hundreds of
[2:10:07] believers in that place and sometimes
[2:10:10] also those places uh uh with with such a
[2:10:14] blessing the people can even misuse it.
[2:10:18] Praise the Lord. Because I mean uh uh uh
[2:10:22] just just like what the Bible says there
[2:10:24] in the in the book of Acts chapter 2
[2:10:26] when Peter stood up that day and he
[2:10:28] preached the Bible says and 3,000 souls
[2:10:31] were added to the church.
[2:10:34] But in that 3,000 souls that's where the
[2:10:38] Bible called a certain man called Ananas
[2:10:41] and his wife. So there was a mixed
[2:10:43] multitude. Praise the Lord. So when you
[2:10:47] have a population of believers, you have
[2:10:50] a mis multitude. When you have a scarce
[2:10:53] of believers, you also have your
[2:10:55] challenges
[2:10:58] because your growing children,
[2:11:01] you know, uh uh uh uh I mean uh uh we
[2:11:05] are not living house to house.
[2:11:08] So if they have their friends in church,
[2:11:10] they want to meet Wednesday night.
[2:11:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:16] And even in that way they are not they
[2:11:18] are not very so close.
[2:11:24] Are you seeing what I'm going this
[2:11:25] morning? Praise the Lord. And and and
[2:11:28] and some of those things uh uh uh uh uh
[2:11:31] our young people don't understand uh you
[2:11:34] know when when when we talk about the
[2:11:35] mystery of God, we talk about the
[2:11:37] message of the hour, the power of the
[2:11:39] Holy Ghost. I mean they enjoy the
[2:11:41] atmosphere. There are things that
[2:11:43] resonate with them, but sometimes it's
[2:11:46] just over their head.
[2:11:49] Sometimes all they need is just a
[2:11:52] community of friends to carry them
[2:11:54] alone. Sometimes that all they need.
[2:11:58] Praise the Lord.
[2:12:00] That all they need. That's the reason
[2:12:02] why when you travel to Europe, England,
[2:12:04] and all of these places, you find all of
[2:12:06] these outstanding church, the movement
[2:12:08] of John Wesley and all of these people.
[2:12:11] I mean there was great revival
[2:12:13] in Europe. You find that the church is
[2:12:17] just left to older people.
[2:12:20] Why? Because the the the younger ones
[2:12:22] cannot make community with older people.
[2:12:26] There's a big generation gap.
[2:12:32] So well I mean they can hang with their
[2:12:33] grandparents view but not every son the
[2:12:35] grandparents grandparents and
[2:12:37] grandparents friends
[2:12:41] as as much as it sounds as it sound
[2:12:43] funny.
[2:12:45] So you find the younger generation go
[2:12:48] away from church. Why? Because there is
[2:12:51] no community to sustain them.
[2:12:56] There is no community to sustain them.
[2:12:59] There is no community of of same age
[2:13:03] value, no community of uh uh same family
[2:13:07] value.
[2:13:10] So they go away.
[2:13:14] And there are some of the things our
[2:13:16] young people struggle with. It's not
[2:13:18] that they don't love the Lord.
[2:13:23] Praise the Lord. And for some of us
[2:13:26] parents, we have had our experience, you
[2:13:28] know, we grow up and and and and now we
[2:13:31] know who the messenger is. And now and
[2:13:33] because of that, you are you are you are
[2:13:36] aging your child to your to your level
[2:13:41] and all you are doing. The message said
[2:13:44] the message say I mean they believe the
[2:13:46] message but uh uh uh uh there are other
[2:13:49] things that they need.
[2:14:02] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:06] I re I really really thank the Lord this
[2:14:09] morning because I was I was just there
[2:14:11] and and asking the Lord. Oh, I help me
[2:14:14] Lord. Let let the people understand why
[2:14:16] I'm going with this thing. Praise the
[2:14:19] Lord. I'm not forming a cut here where
[2:14:21] we we all going to go to the north of
[2:14:23] Minneapolis and make our community
[2:14:25] there. That's not what I'm talking
[2:14:26] about. That's that just not what I'm
[2:14:29] talking about. Praise the Lord.
[2:14:33] Because people quick to form CS of these
[2:14:36] things
[2:14:43] as parents. That's the things that we we
[2:14:47] that's the thing that that must that
[2:14:48] must that must that must consume us.
[2:14:53] What are we doing to to to to
[2:14:57] uh to to help our children?
[2:15:02] Because their challenges is different
[2:15:04] from our challenges.
[2:15:07] Praise the Lord. Their challenges is
[2:15:10] completely different from our
[2:15:12] challenges.
[2:15:20] If you want to keep them in this
[2:15:22] community, they got to grab the value of
[2:15:24] the community.
[2:15:27] They got to grab the the value.
[2:15:32] What makes it good to serve the Lord?
[2:15:33] What makes it good to live a godly life?
[2:15:36] to esteem from sin and and get away from
[2:15:38] a nasty life.
[2:15:43] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:47] Because sometimes it just take a a one
[2:15:50] sound of something or one sight of
[2:15:52] something and then that child has a
[2:15:55] demon to fight the rest of their life
[2:16:01] because they were they were exposed to
[2:16:03] some uh uncensored program and and some
[2:16:06] filthy thing on the internet and then
[2:16:08] they have a demon to fight.
[2:16:14] Why? Because daddy and mommy only talk
[2:16:16] about the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:19] They are living in heavenly places.
[2:16:23] Praise the Lord.
[2:16:25] Because they are in heavenly places,
[2:16:27] they can leave the children for angels
[2:16:29] to take care of them and they just go to
[2:16:30] work.
[2:16:46] Praise the Lord.
[2:16:49] How are you sustaining your community?
[2:16:51] How are you carrying the value of your
[2:16:54] community?
[2:16:58] Praise the Lord.
[2:17:06] And sometimes we just you know we just
[2:17:08] you know keep ourself in this in this uh
[2:17:11] uh you know in our own bubble
[2:17:15] a bubble that is filled of complaints.
[2:17:17] We just complain about everything
[2:17:20] these day. I don't know what is
[2:17:21] happening to the church. What is
[2:17:22] happening? I mean tell us what is
[2:17:24] happening.
[2:17:29] Praise the Lord.
[2:17:32] You know what happened? If you ever live
[2:17:35] in a place for many years and then you
[2:17:38] move out
[2:17:40] and then you go back. You remember we
[2:17:42] talk about familiar places. You go back
[2:17:45] and visit your community.
[2:17:48] Sometimes it it it change but yet there
[2:17:52] are things you still appreciate.
[2:17:57] Praise the Lord. And sometimes that's
[2:17:59] what it is when you go away from church.
[2:18:03] You go to a convention, you visit other
[2:18:05] churches, you come back, you appreciate
[2:18:08] your little group,
[2:18:11] you realize that, well, thank God we
[2:18:13] have a place
[2:18:15] to go to.
[2:18:18] We have a place where we meet Wednesday
[2:18:20] night
[2:18:24] and Sunday morning.
[2:18:27] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:30] Bring in all of allowing some of our
[2:18:32] brothers to come in and visit with us uh
[2:18:35] you know uh uh uh uh a weekend service
[2:18:37] and all of that. All of those things is
[2:18:39] to improve the community
[2:18:42] is to allow another preacher comes in
[2:18:45] with uh with his inspiration
[2:18:48] and sometimes he preach and he connects
[2:18:51] with the things that we've been talking
[2:18:53] about.
[2:18:54] Then you realize, oh yeah, the Lord is
[2:18:56] in our midst.
[2:19:01] Thank God for what he's doing in our
[2:19:03] midst.
[2:19:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:19:09] But you see if if if we just see the
[2:19:11] church as a place to associate
[2:19:16] you come to church and and we don't see
[2:19:18] you you I mean we don't see you we don't
[2:19:20] know about you
[2:19:22] you are there and then you show up again
[2:19:27] even in your own spiritual work
[2:19:32] you can't connect with what God is doing
[2:19:34] in your local assembly you can't connect
[2:19:37] with it
[2:19:39] and that's where the person comes to the
[2:19:40] play I'm serving God for myself
[2:19:45] serving God for myself you know
[2:19:47] salvation is individual affair
[2:19:50] then we come up with all of these things
[2:19:52] those are backsliding language
[2:19:55] when you are serving God you be
[2:19:57] serviceable to people
[2:20:00] that's what Jesus taught us you will
[2:20:02] serve God for other people you will
[2:20:04] serve God for your for your neighbors
[2:20:06] your your co-workers
[2:20:10] because he said, "Let men see your good
[2:20:12] work and glorify your father.
[2:20:22] Are we together?"
[2:20:25] The birth crowd of the church, we go
[2:20:27] through those things. Some sometimes
[2:20:29] even the preacher feels it. He preach
[2:20:32] and he preach and preach and it it it
[2:20:34] just feel like oh God what's what's
[2:20:36] what's happening
[2:20:38] and in that in that sense of uh trying
[2:20:40] to find the word of God or trying to
[2:20:43] find the man of God he feels he feel a
[2:20:46] sense of loneliness
[2:20:48] I can't get the people on board
[2:20:53] why are they not grapping the Lord what
[2:20:54] are we
[2:21:02] And sometimes you say is it only our
[2:21:04] assembly
[2:21:07] until you start to talk to another
[2:21:09] brother and start telling you all of his
[2:21:10] problem.
[2:21:12] Praise the Lord. Start telling you all
[2:21:14] of your I said brother I I even know
[2:21:16] where we going. You know people don't
[2:21:18] come to church on Wednesday night. I
[2:21:19] mean the church is oh my God it's it's
[2:21:21] everywhere. Lord just get of grace.
[2:21:24] Let's let's just hold. Let's just hold
[2:21:26] because you said I will build my church
[2:21:28] and the gates of hell will not prevail.
[2:21:37] Praise the Lord. You love the Lord.
[2:21:45] I'm I'm so glad that the Lord been able
[2:21:48] to give us a breakthrough so you can
[2:21:49] really be able to grab what I'm bringing
[2:21:51] to you this morning.
[2:21:54] If you listen to to all the statistics
[2:21:57] out there of the things that are
[2:22:00] happening in family,
[2:22:02] praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:22:06] It's all because of the environment
[2:22:09] where they live.
[2:22:12] Do you know that people can move to new
[2:22:14] environment but still be living in their
[2:22:16] old environment?
[2:22:20] mindset
[2:22:24] mindset.
[2:22:26] They can be living in their move, move
[2:22:29] away, living in a new environment, but
[2:22:31] they want to replicate.
[2:22:34] They want to bring the city of the old
[2:22:36] environment back. Every store that used
[2:22:38] to be in the neighborhood, they want to
[2:22:40] bring it back because that all they talk
[2:22:42] about the place I used to live, there
[2:22:44] was just a store just across the street.
[2:22:46] I just used to run there. You don't have
[2:22:48] it now.
[2:22:51] It works better for you if you start
[2:22:54] knowing the new environment.
[2:22:57] Oh, my neighbor that used to be that
[2:22:59] man. Oh my god, that that neighbor you
[2:23:02] you don't have him.
[2:23:05] You are just living in in in that place.
[2:23:10] And we we talk about it like that. But
[2:23:12] it it happened to us in different ways.
[2:23:15] Even sometimes in relationship,
[2:23:20] people live their past when they are not
[2:23:23] in it.
[2:23:26] They used to be single. They used to be
[2:23:28] alone and now they're married. But they
[2:23:30] they are just they they are just in that
[2:23:33] environment of their mind how they used
[2:23:36] to live.
[2:23:39] Some of those things destroy homes. It
[2:23:41] destroy lives.
[2:23:44] We we bring how our our our you know our
[2:23:47] parents you know when we were small this
[2:23:49] is what my parent used to do this is
[2:23:50] what my parent used to do your
[2:23:53] generation this is how
[2:23:57] your parent did not born that child you
[2:23:58] born that child.
[2:24:02] So you are living in a new environment.
[2:24:08] Dwelling in a new environment, living in
[2:24:10] the old.
[2:24:14] You are dwelling in a new environment
[2:24:16] living in the old.
[2:24:22] And if you get stuck in that old
[2:24:24] environment,
[2:24:26] you will suffer
[2:24:29] because that store is not across the
[2:24:31] street.
[2:24:34] The store is not across the street. If
[2:24:36] you used to yell at the man selling,
[2:24:38] "Joseph,
[2:24:41] please bring me.
[2:24:57] Joseph is not there.
[2:25:00] He's not there.
[2:25:03] Joseph is not there.
[2:25:06] You will just be murmuring, regretting.
[2:25:10] And when you are doing that, your life
[2:25:12] is not advancing.
[2:25:15] You are just stuck. Because you are
[2:25:17] living in your past.
[2:25:21] Your past has become your hero.
[2:25:26] You talk about the past. You celebrate
[2:25:28] the past.
[2:25:30] What's happening now? What is happening
[2:25:32] here? What are we doing here?
[2:25:37] Praise the Lord.
[2:25:39] I might not be your your fiery preacher.
[2:25:42] Praise the Lord. This church might not
[2:25:45] be the kind of a big assembly that you
[2:25:47] but there is something that is happening
[2:25:48] here. And what I want to stay to, I want
[2:25:52] to stay to the vision that God gave me.
[2:25:55] I don't know the vision of your former
[2:25:57] pastor or your favorite preacher.
[2:26:12] Time is far spent.
[2:26:16] Thank you for bearing with me this
[2:26:19] afternoon. Musicians, you can come.
[2:26:22] You can come while we just wind this
[2:26:24] thing down.
[2:26:32] While we just wind this thing down.
[2:26:35] Musicians, you can come. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:26:41] I will restore. When Jesus died on the
[2:26:43] cross, he was forsaken by men here on
[2:26:45] earth. And he spoke in another thong. He
[2:26:48] said, "My God, why have thou forsaken
[2:26:51] me?" church from that day to this is
[2:26:55] move up
[2:26:57] some seeds coming right out of the seam.
[2:27:00] So when he said that he saw a seed it
[2:27:04] move up
[2:27:09] and when the Holy Ghost came back on the
[2:27:11] on the days of Pentecost it became the
[2:27:14] birth cry of the church. The church will
[2:27:17] labor. The people will go through
[2:27:18] persecution. They will go through
[2:27:21] different things
[2:27:24] and sometimes it will looks like God is
[2:27:26] not in their midst.
[2:27:29] Praise the Lord.
[2:27:31] If he was the master of the house, he
[2:27:34] was rejected. He was neglected and he
[2:27:36] had to go all through this.
[2:27:42] It became a birth crowd of the church.
[2:27:44] It became the birth crowd of the
[2:27:46] believers.
[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:27:58] [Music]
[2:28:00] But Jesus said, "I will build my
[2:28:03] church." You know, there's one thing
[2:28:05] that I tell the Lord all the time. I
[2:28:07] say, "You say you build your church.
[2:28:09] You say all that the father has given me
[2:28:11] will come." Praise the Lord. And all I
[2:28:15] have to do is just preach the word. If
[2:28:17] it is them that the father has given,
[2:28:19] they will be gravitated to the word.
[2:28:23] [Music]
[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:37] Oh, I'm looking I'm looking forward to
[2:28:40] God doing
[2:28:43] having his way in our midst.
[2:28:46] I'm looking forward to God helping our
[2:28:50] young people.
[2:28:53] Let the value of what they've been
[2:28:56] taught, the value of what they hear and
[2:28:58] sometimes they don't understand. Let it
[2:29:00] let it let let it grab their life. And
[2:29:03] sometime you you parents you won't even
[2:29:05] take a vacation and go for the
[2:29:07] convention. Go away, take your family
[2:29:09] somewhere and and and and just see how
[2:29:12] believers are doing things other places.
[2:29:14] It helps you.
[2:29:16] [Music]
[2:29:22] I'm I'm not I'm not a I'm not this I'm
[2:29:24] not that kind of a preacher that just
[2:29:26] want to plant you by my side. No. If you
[2:29:28] find a place that can that can you can
[2:29:30] better serve the Lord than this place,
[2:29:32] go and serve the Lord better. That's
[2:29:33] what I want. I want when I hear from
[2:29:35] you, I want to hear you serving God
[2:29:37] better. That's what rejoice my heart.

[2:29:43] walking in truth.
