[1:33] this was kind of a surprise to me being
[1:35] here this morning because I was supposed
[1:38] to be leaving the city this morning at
[1:41] six o'clock
[1:42] the gold about 150 miles north from here
[1:45] with some friends and so when they told
[1:48] me asked to be here this morning to
[1:50] speak at the breakfast I kind of had to
[1:52] hurry up and change your program a
[1:56] little it's always a privilege though to
[1:58] be where the people of the Lord is
[2:02] where the carcasses the Eagles will be
[2:05] gathered
[2:07] and I'm so happy to be here and to meet
[2:09] all of our friends again on Fellowship
[2:11] you can imagine how I feel
[2:15] standing here with a man who has been
[2:17] preaching the gospel when I was a little
[2:19] bitty fella and um
[2:23] that's taking a long time back
[2:26] and uh but um
[2:29] so thankful to be assembled here with
[2:32] the people
[2:33] and now tonight is another great night
[2:36] we're expecting God to do great things
[2:40] and through this week I've had the
[2:43] privilege of
[2:44] of going up and down through the
[2:46] Maricopa Valley here speaking with the
[2:48] people in their churches and we've had a
[2:51] great time so grateful for is the
[2:54] fellowship and of the Holy Spirit among
[2:57] these people
[2:59] and I am looking forward also to Sunday
[3:03] afternoon when it's my privilege to
[3:06] speak again Sunday afternoon and then
[3:09] Monday night at the banquet
[3:12] now I'm trusting that all that's do
[3:16] being done are said well we'll have a
[3:18] great climax Monday night
[3:21] brother Oral Roberts has been chosen to
[3:24] speak this banquet meeting and we are we
[3:27] want to pray for him
[3:29] I pray that God will give him such a
[3:32] message that will will send Phoenix to
[3:34] his knees of trembling
[3:36] shaking the very presence of God in in
[3:39] the front of the people
[3:41] and uh we are hoping that to come to
[3:44] pass
[3:45] and all along the line everything that's
[3:47] done we trust it at least that's an
[3:49] impression upon Phoenix that there can
[3:52] never be the same and the people who's
[3:54] been here and will go back into their
[3:56] own cities well not go back the way they
[4:00] come out go back uh inspired with a more
[4:04] determination to do the work of the Lord
[4:07] with a new vision from God
[4:12] um here because of a vision
[4:17] and if any of you has ever taken any
[4:19] tapes I'm not a tape salesman of course
[4:21] we have a tate business around the world
[4:24] but if you ever bought a tape from me or
[4:27] not for me but from Mr McGuire he's here
[4:29] somewhere taking tapes this morning I
[4:31] suppose
[4:33] get that one what time is it sir
[4:38] I'm standing in a place so I I don't
[4:41] know the next move
[4:43] I have seen Vision since I was a little
[4:46] boy
[4:47] first thing I can remember in early in
[4:49] life was a vision
[4:51] and I before people from anywhere I
[4:54] asked anybody to tell me one time that
[4:56] one of them ever failed
[4:58] it can't fail it's God
[5:01] therefore this one has me in such a
[5:03] condition till I
[5:04] uh I go to thinking about it and just
[5:07] tears me up
[5:09] and I know something is going to take
[5:11] place
[5:12] and uh I would be afraid
[5:16] just like what I was saying to someone
[5:18] the other day
[5:19] we realize that we don't want to take
[5:22] God and make it just a gimmick now and
[5:25] we don't want to take the gifts of God
[5:26] make gimmicks out of it when you say the
[5:29] Lord said something be sure the Lord
[5:31] told you be not an impression see
[5:34] there's too much of that now
[5:36] you're seeing the people don't know how
[5:38] to have confidence if God says anything
[5:40] it must be just exactly that way it must
[5:42] happen that way
[5:45] that's how we can trust the Bible
[5:47] in the beginning it promised a messiah
[5:50] those Hebrew prophets spoke of the
[5:52] Messiah what he would do that Messiah
[5:55] came just exactly the way it was the
[5:57] Bible on one hand says it'll happen at a
[5:59] certain time it does right on down now
[6:01] we got confidence that there will be a
[6:03] rapture
[6:04] Jesus will be coming amen we're right
[6:06] here because it's never failed anywhere
[6:08] else and it can't fail now that's our
[6:10] confidence
[6:13] like when Jeremiah
[6:15] the Lord had told him put that yoke on
[6:18] his neck no matter what profit or what
[6:20] else said that anything contrary to the
[6:23] 70 years down in Babylon it'd have to be
[6:25] that way that Tina raised up a prophet
[6:28] and a son of a prophet
[6:31] and he took that yolk from Jeremiah's
[6:33] neck and break it and said thus saith
[6:36] the Lord in two years he'll be back
[6:39] he said even the Prophet Jeremiah said
[6:41] amen Hina the Lord perform your words
[6:44] but let us remember there's been
[6:46] prophets before us
[6:49] and when they prophets only no one when
[6:51] he's prophecy comes to pass
[6:54] I think that's a very good Pentecostal
[6:56] lesson
[6:59] we can be impressed be excited
[7:02] and we can have the joy and blessings of
[7:06] the Lord but when we speak in the name
[7:08] of the Lord and if what we speak is
[7:10] exactly with that word you stay away
[7:12] from it I don't care how good it looks
[7:14] for this is a complete revelation of
[7:17] Jesus Christ
[7:19] stay with that word don't you leave it
[7:23] for nothing
[7:25] uh
[7:27] see if Hannan was just a thought
[7:30] that Revelation and I don't believe the
[7:33] man was a hypocrite he was inspired
[7:35] but it didn't compare with the word
[7:38] it's got to be the word
[7:41] and one time it happened again
[7:44] that when Jehovah's come down to visit
[7:45] Ahab and they had a counseling of going
[7:48] up to Ramos Gilead
[7:51] and Jehovah said of course my chariots
[7:53] is yours my people is yours he said but
[7:55] should not we consult the Lord Ahab said
[7:57] certainly we should done that so they
[7:59] had 400
[8:02] Hebrew Prophets
[8:03] not Balaam prophets not heathens but
[8:06] Hebrew Prophets
[8:08] zedekar came up with two big horns and
[8:11] said thus saith the Lord by this you're
[8:13] going to push Syria Plum out of the
[8:15] country fundamentally he was right but
[8:17] there's more goes with it besides that
[8:19] you can be ever so fundamental right
[8:22] get it the promises of God is based upon
[8:25] a condition
[8:27] that he was keeping their sacrifices
[8:29] Justice Reverend as they could
[8:32] and doing what the Lord told him yet
[8:34] without that sincerity behind it
[8:37] offering us it would become a family
[8:39] tradition
[8:40] that's where we're taking Pentecost
[8:44] a family tradition
[8:47] got to get more sincere in that
[8:50] do you expect God to answer these
[8:52] blessings and promises you come back
[8:55] to the sincerity of that word
[8:58] what the word says stay with it
[9:02] now this Prophet fundamentally was right
[9:05] when God divided up the land that Joshua
[9:08] gave that to Israel and here was the
[9:10] enemies be filling their bellies with
[9:12] the wheat that was raised up at Rhema
[9:15] and fundamentally right
[9:19] but you see it was on conditions and
[9:22] then prophets or ministers prophesying
[9:24] was exactly right then they said to this
[9:27] man of God Jehoshaphat they seem to be
[9:30] something a little contrary
[9:33] he said isn't there one more
[9:36] one more after having 400
[9:41] what seemed ridiculous but yet way down
[9:45] deep in that man's heart he knows
[9:47] there's something wrong
[9:49] any man of God can see there's something
[9:52] wrong
[9:54] our blessings is fine
[9:57] but it isn't coming up to the mark
[10:01] so he's seen there was something wrong
[10:02] said is there one more said yes or is
[10:04] one more
[10:06] Micah the son of England but said I hate
[10:08] him
[10:10] said he's constantly tearing us up
[10:13] rebuking us he said let not the king say
[10:16] so but let's hear him and so they sent
[10:17] for him to come
[10:20] and they said now you've been kicked out
[10:21] of the association long enough now you
[10:23] can get over here and say something the
[10:24] same way they do and it'll be all right
[10:26] he said as the Lord God Lives I'll say
[10:29] only what he puts on my heart
[10:32] we need Emily again we need Micah rather
[10:37] and they that night he asked to wait on
[10:40] the Lord and when he saw the vision
[10:42] of the Lord then he checked that with
[10:45] the word
[10:47] and when he checked it with the word the
[10:49] word and the vision was the same
[10:52] then he stood before them and told him
[10:55] what would happen
[10:56] and of course you know zedekiah smacked
[10:58] him in the mouth and said which way to
[11:00] the war did the Lord go when he left me
[11:02] the spirit of the Lord when he left me
[11:04] he said you'll see Ahab said put this
[11:06] felony in a prison give him the bread of
[11:09] Sorrow
[11:11] and said then when I return I'll deal
[11:13] with him he said if you return it all
[11:16] the Lord hasn't spoke to me
[11:20] um
[11:21] you see it's got to be with the word
[11:24] happy
[11:25] and we must
[11:28] remember that by the way I I didn't come
[11:32] to see that let's pray let's bow our
[11:34] heads everybody
[11:40] our heavenly father
[11:43] we come this morning in the name of the
[11:46] Lord Jesus
[11:48] and here thou has given to me this
[11:50] morning Lord this fine group of people
[11:52] that I might speak a few words to these
[11:54] businessmen from all over the nation
[11:58] Lord I pray that you will grant this
[12:01] morning that there will be something
[12:03] said that will not be just someone
[12:06] standing here to take up some time or to
[12:09] entertain but the word of the Lord might
[12:12] in some unknown way even to us be
[12:15] brought forth that would do something to
[12:17] help the people
[12:18] it's a great hour
[12:20] heal the sake The Afflicted
[12:23] God we pray that you'll stir the hearts
[12:26] of these businessmen
[12:28] bless the ministers your Believers of
[12:31] all different phases and sections and
[12:34] gifts and offices to where you have
[12:36] place in and may we go this morning with
[12:39] the the same attitude of those who came
[12:42] from he may Ascend did not our hearts
[12:44] burn within us
[12:46] May the Holy Spirit come now and talk to
[12:48] our hearts for the next few minutes
[12:49] through the word
[12:51] granted Lord we asked it in Jesus name
[12:54] amen
[12:56] now to you who just like to take a few
[13:01] notes I jotted down here to kind of
[13:03] remind me I was
[13:05] determined to go somewhere today but
[13:07] it's always the word of the Lord are the
[13:10] opportunities to speak for him comes
[13:12] first
[13:14] we don't know what time we're going to
[13:15] leave this world and we want to put in
[13:17] every Speck of time that we know how
[13:21] now I want to read this morning from
[13:23] Saint Matthew's gospel the 19th Chapter
[13:25] beginning with the 16th verse for just a
[13:28] little uh a text to draw from here as
[13:32] the holy spirit will a context
[13:34] and the whole one came and said unto him
[13:37] good master
[13:39] what good things shall I do that I may
[13:42] inherit eternal life
[13:44] I may have eternal life
[13:48] I want to stop just a moment
[13:50] what good thing could I do that I may
[13:53] have eternal life
[13:55] and he said unto him why cause thou me
[13:58] good there is
[14:00] none good but one that is God but if I
[14:05] will enter into life keep the
[14:06] Commandments
[14:07] he said unto him
[14:09] which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder
[14:13] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[14:17] shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear
[14:19] false witness honor thy father not
[14:22] mother Thou shalt love thy neighbor as a
[14:25] self
[14:26] the young man said unto him all these
[14:28] things have I kept from my youth what
[14:32] lacketh ah yes
[14:35] Jesus said unto him if thou will be
[14:38] perfect go and sell what thou has and
[14:42] give to the poor and thou shall have
[14:43] Treasures in Heaven and come follow me
[14:48] but when the young man heard that saying
[14:50] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[14:53] possessions
[14:54] then said Jesus unto the disciples
[14:57] verily I say unto you that a rich man
[15:00] shall hardly enter in the Kingdom of
[15:02] Heaven
[15:03] again I say unto you it is easier for a
[15:05] camel to go through the eye of a needle
[15:07] than for a rich man to enter the kingdom
[15:10] of God
[15:11] and when his disciples heard it they
[15:13] were exceedingly amazed saying who then
[15:16] can be saved Jesus said Jesus beheld
[15:20] them and said unto them
[15:23] with man this is impossible
[15:25] but With God all things are possible
[15:29] [Applause]
[15:31] now I would like to draw from this
[15:35] little thing here a context if it would
[15:38] if you will permit me just a few minutes
[15:42] now
[15:44] we can imagine the event
[15:47] and being that this is the businessman's
[15:50] breakfast Saturday morning's regular
[15:52] breakfast I believe
[15:55] and I had the privilege of speaking last
[15:57] Saturday morning which I appreciate this
[16:00] invitation from these fine brethren who
[16:04] lets me come in my illiteracy and before
[16:08] smart and educated people and try to get
[16:12] forth this message that I I feel that
[16:15] our hearts need
[16:18] and I appreciate that
[16:20] when many doors closing swiftly behind
[16:24] so I'm I'm thankful to these men in a
[16:28] certainly a pray that God bless them
[16:31] if I started in the morning I tried to
[16:33] bring a message that would be what I
[16:36] thought was needful I spoke on uh use a
[16:39] car how he was a great man example
[16:41] before Isaiah but when he got lifted up
[16:43] then he tried to take the place of a
[16:46] priest a minister
[16:48] and in doing so God smote him with
[16:51] Leprosy and it was a great lesson to
[16:54] Isaiah to know not to trust in what
[16:56] anything but God then he was in the
[17:00] temple and saw that the place I asked my
[17:03] brethren don't try to take the place of
[17:06] nothing but a businessman whatever God's
[17:08] called you to do don't try to be
[17:10] preachers because we have hard enough
[17:12] time keep it straight anyhow and you get
[17:14] it mixed up so let's just stay what God
[17:18] calls us to be nothing to the laity it's
[17:21] a good thing for us to try to remain
[17:23] don't try to impersonate somebody else
[17:26] be just what you are we'd all like to be
[17:30] a Billy Graham
[17:31] and Oral Roberts would all like to be
[17:34] that but remember in the kingdom of God
[17:36] and his great economy if we'll be the
[17:39] doormat
[17:40] but that's our place we'll be just as
[17:42] much as they are but you must maintain
[17:46] your position and where Christ has
[17:48] placed you
[17:49] I like to speak this morning now on
[17:51] investments
[17:54] not most any good businessman is
[17:57] interested in some good Investments
[18:02] and I chose this because it was
[18:04] businessman
[18:06] we should be interested in Investments
[18:11] and most all people like that
[18:14] Investments and especially at all be
[18:17] outstanding to a group of businessmen
[18:20] and we're always trying to find
[18:22] somewhere to make a few Investments
[18:25] to make a few dollars or and that's all
[18:28] right I have nothing to say against that
[18:30] that's perfectly all right but I speak
[18:32] to you all the very best investment that
[18:36] I know to make an investment very best
[18:39] place rather to make an investment
[18:44] good business
[18:46] are a good businessman
[18:49] knows better than to gamble
[18:52] don't Gamble
[18:54] you're going to lose
[18:57] you can't win gambling
[19:01] you're a Parker one time a rich man an
[19:03] X-Men back of Harper again
[19:06] gambling is a disease
[19:09] it's just an evil spirit
[19:12] and it gets on to people sometime in
[19:15] mile far
[19:16] you can gamble in religion might not
[19:19] know it
[19:20] but you can
[19:23] it's just like if the nation would stop
[19:25] to see you let a drunk man get out
[19:27] you're on the street with the with it
[19:29] with his automobile that man ought to
[19:31] have at least 10 years in prison
[19:35] you let a man go down the street this
[19:37] morning with a with a pistol in his
[19:40] hands shooting around like that they had
[19:42] tore the keys away on that guy they'd
[19:44] sent him to the inner jails
[19:47] and then a drunk man can come down the
[19:49] street he's absolutely just as much in
[19:53] danger killing somebody as a man is with
[19:55] a pistol and he gets five dollars for it
[19:58] he is it's almost premeditated murder
[20:03] but to see the nation don't look at it
[20:05] that way
[20:07] and neither does people sometime when
[20:09] they're gambling
[20:10] little mild Farms are saying oh well I
[20:14] I'm as good as the rest of them
[20:16] that's a Gamel
[20:19] should do that that's poor business
[20:23] any good businessman shouldn't take his
[20:26] money and gambling and some Believers
[20:28] should never uh Gamble or else this is
[20:32] all right I'll take the chance on him
[20:33] you do there's a pattern lay down a
[20:37] definitely faint and it doesn't belong
[20:39] in any certain group of people it's
[20:41] God's word
[20:43] don't gamble on that
[20:45] now don't take chances and another thing
[20:48] I noticed among people sometime
[20:51] especially in uh man get a hold of a
[20:53] little money and then he'll try to
[20:56] invested in some kind of a get rich
[20:58] overnight
[21:00] some are unidentified business
[21:04] you'll lose the shirt off your back and
[21:06] you know that
[21:08] don't you try that
[21:10] and a good sensible thinking businessman
[21:13] won't do that
[21:15] it's somebody who's green at the job
[21:18] or take a chance like that it never pays
[21:20] off
[21:21] or how many cases have I seen in my time
[21:25] where people had their life saving and
[21:27] it gets some little Gadget out get rich
[21:29] overnight real quick and all like this
[21:31] and they got it
[21:33] then the first thing you know they find
[21:35] themselves up on the uh on the skid row
[21:39] or somewhere trying to satisfy other or
[21:42] drown their thoughts of what they've
[21:44] done
[21:47] and that could be applied also in the
[21:50] Realms of Christianity
[21:52] some get rich overnight shake hands to
[21:55] the preacher and put your name on the
[21:56] book it's all over you never believe
[21:58] such stuff as that
[22:01] don't work out
[22:03] it's got to come one way
[22:07] these get rich overnight doesn't a good
[22:10] businessman will Fool with It
[22:12] if you got any anything you want to
[22:14] invest in uh get some identified a
[22:19] business
[22:21] something that's been proven it it keeps
[22:26] it keeps its promise it pays off
[22:29] and here's another thing don't keep your
[22:31] money in your pocket
[22:34] you never get anything somebody steal it
[22:36] from you after a while
[22:39] you don't want to do that
[22:41] Jesus taught the same thing
[22:44] when you got a talent don't don't hide
[22:46] it
[22:47] you gotta put it to use growing
[22:51] I may be talking to Presbyterian
[22:54] Methodist Baptists and these breakfasts
[22:55] and whatever more you never know who's
[22:57] sitting before you see so
[23:00] remember if you got some investment
[23:03] something to invest in invested in
[23:06] something that's good something that's
[23:08] real something that's been proven
[23:11] that'll pay off
[23:13] some good a reliable identified firm
[23:17] that has been proven to pay off in the
[23:20] past
[23:21] it's got a name behind it
[23:24] you may know that
[23:26] even if you have to take a slower coming
