camp of the lord hallelujah glory be to god i always tell my brother i said though sometimes amen you can't say but the hand for the lord let's just clap just for the lord hallelujah don't leave me to god hey amen you know our our god is a god of solution amen so when he let some problem to come because he know he knows where it's going to end so and you will never be perfected without trying in the pain you can't grow up without trial and pain but i'm sad if you don't ever try on the pain ask for it sometimes we say thank god for the devil because the devil helped god to manifest all his attributes grab them for the lord amen amen glory be to god as we are the egos hallelujah where the ego ego when you just born eat strong food not milk we are not the babies praise the lord god bless you literally can you stand up let us go meets during the week just all home up a little bit right i just uh prepare as anyone can do but we just wait upon the lord thank you musicians i know uh father scott is happy because he wanted to see my wife singing so praise the lord i know that i'm actually doing that okay let us open in john 18. john chapter 18 verse 37-38 are you there i always like to read with you because my accent sometimes is a french accent right so when i'm reading you must also read please okay let's read let us read palace therefore said unto him at thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was a bomb and for this course came i into the world that i should obey witness unto the truth everyone that's of the truth hear my voice 38. pilate said unto him what is truth i stopped first day you know in 37 jesus answered him and in 38 and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and said unto them i found in him no fault at all shall we pray heavenly father anyone can read the scripture and they try to explain like a newspaper this is not a newspaper lord is your word your children they come from home lord they've got questions they've got burdened father we come to thee to hear from you not from me lord father put me aside father bless all of us this evening lord we need you or king of kings father you lead us father for everything you want us to do tell us father you always use the gift for your children you take father us lead to the light because you are the light of the world oh you divine that's what the bridge is lord we want that life father from you and us we can produce the fruit father help us in this this world but everything is the end father all people they love people most of people father they love money more than you they are putting people father in their heart they don't preach the gospel father for you they preach the gospel for the popularity money you know how a heart oh lord bless your servant brother only always try lord you will never succeed without the father all your children father the elders the youth around here father there are all of them we commit them in your hand myself in your hand father i come to thee i prepare as a minister but you are at the preacher the preacher is the lord jesus christ the one was to blessing us this evening the lord jesus christ we invite you bless the word in the name of the lord jesus christ we said amen may be seated my small title this uh evening is what is truth very short if you notice in the scripture did jesus didn't answer that question they asked him what is truth jesus didn't answer that question because it was the truth the tutor can't testify about itself the truth testified in a person when someone said we have the truth this church said we've got the truth that just said our come to us we are going to heaven near our church everybody they can say to come to our church but the truth doesn't ever change the truth is a person walking that's why this message and time message those people they are trying to correct the prophet to to judge quotations and and to start to judge the cloud it was a smoke all those things they are late because the message now is becoming a person walking hallelujah clapton for the lord amen let us clap for the lord praise the lord don't sleep don't sleep on me come on come on church praise god they are late because the message it's the person there are people walking now the message came to make us god the children of dogs are dogs the children of serpent are serpent and the children of god are god praise god that's why paul said ah and yet let's just forget about the to lay the end of the sea contours are good but let us go on to perfection as your father is perfect so it's possible for us to be perfect in freddy's perfection hallelujah praise the lord glory be to god praise god what is truth can i have number one please sister number one uh let us go there now he is i don't want to hurt you don't want to shake you object hide from you but i wish to preach the truth there is one things about it brother the truth we never make you popular but the truth will make you honest that's one good thing and doesn't you rather be honest than be popular certainly you had amen that's the truth will you take you will help you to be honest that's why in the message we don't want to be popular we want to be honest and and the majority is not a full of people or a thousand majority is the holy spirit a one person with the holy spirit is a majority than hundred people those that don't have the holy spirit that's why babraham said bring your family or children to the church where the holy spirit is controlling the church it's not because of joseph speaking good english and the french whatever no ways it's because of the holy spirit because it's only the holy spirit will help us to understand god to come close to god and to change the pig nature to the lamb nature and to be ready to be perfected hallelujah and go to the rapture praise god amen what is truth this is like in heaven number two i just put if we don't finish it okay we just go the way the spirit today i just want to read now i want you to know that when the phenomena was done miracles will perform the signs and wonders and when they went out the bible said the mexican magnitude went out it makes a group of people some of them believers some are pretending to believe the great mir the great miracle had been done people went out a professed believer and there was not believers can i go to the the third one please and that's where a great bunch of our trouble is we could put our finger on it is men and the who and the women who come into church and profess to be believers and they are not believers i found it in the pulpit i found it in a prayer line i found that in everywhere where men come in and women who said i'm a believer and profess to be a believer and they are not believers amen amen it's not a matter to say i'm a believer and you are a believer it's not to say i am a message believer it makes you already a message believer that's why jesus said if you read you hear the word you must put in a practice you hear you put in the practice you hear you put in the practice and when you put the practice it start to form you and to transform you and you start to be to fall in love with the world to fall in love with the world and the world will help you to change your nature because we came all of us upon the earth sinners i know one day i used to have one pasta that was wonderful the good pasta in south africa he used to underline too much since i was born i never committed that terry's i was just there i'm okay i'm fine that's one day i said you know it's fine but me i prefer a pasta indeed adultery is a smoke sinner and when jesus touch his heart and the feeling the holy spirit and the sleep change then you you have you were born perfect [Music] yeah you yeah if you feel like you're born perfect you don't need to come to church stay go to to heaven and there is no thing like that that's why branham said as a christian you must have the heart when a brother or sister fall baby laugh go and help him to stand up don't be there and debate biting and speaking wrong about her a good christian is to help your brother sister when he's down that's to show that you're a christian hallelujah praise god assistant everyone before that's number four oh i know i don't know i just did first oh oh oh you're right that's number four you're right i was on five okay a christian is not a tool or some kind of a mechanical range to a great big religious regime that's right a christian is not some kind of tool that keep a religious organization moving a christian that is not a christian a christian is to be christ like a christian cannot be a christian until christ comes into the main the life of christ in him then he produces the life that the christ lives and you the things that christ did amen clap the hand for the lord just for the yeah lord won't sleep i don't like somebody to sleep when i'm preaching i don't like i hate that one i don't like it glory be to god praise god how can you a christian when they are singing hallelujah praise the lord thinking thing when preaching you start now which kind of spirit come on come on church when you feel that one you have to stand up and there just said no no this is the demons and notice as soon as they say amen that sleepness goes so tell me which kind of spirit was is it the devil when you feel it's just all your body stand up say what you put water i'm not sleeping yet fight hallelujah love them for the lord the praise god hey man glory be to god number six you are the best sister very fast wonderful so i think i'm gonna finish my cut i was just wondering maybe i won't finish okay today i just put foundation next time we'll continue if we go to the details your experience are getting old i like this something you heard 20 years ago what are you right now what does it mean now i'm not yelling at you better i feel good look that's right you've got to get a new baptism every day every day every day just keep going no any limit to it you try to say well now look a month ago i heard a wonderful experience that the testimony don't work what about now right right and i want you to notice there was some of it in there now god told moses to have an iron to go out and gather up some of it now he said there is going to last plump through your jain till you get into the millennium over yonder just exactly a type of holy ghost amen amen praise god now we are going just follow me care fully now we are we are taking a cave we need the baptism of the holy spirit every day every day every day right those are born again we need also refilling for every day every day and those are not born again they need also the baptism every day every day every day that's where there is a challenge and there is a problem sometimes you can hear someone was a pastor 40 years and they quit the puppy to say i never believe the message and you wonder you wonder how all these years was preaching so to that suddenly he said he never believed the message and the queen some brothers they were a good brother but after 10 years 15 they backslid what's going on and when you hear those kind of things don't laugh it can also happen to you when you hear that one is the time you have to kneed down to make sure god i need that holy spirit at the right place glory be to god see let us go to the seven already good he said they that cannot stand uh testament are bastard children and not the children of god see they are worked up on the emotion see they see that i talked about a while ago that soul wasn't there to start with it was anointed with the spirit and and he done all kinds oh you the when your spirit's anointed you can it's the real genuine holy ghost and you could do still be a devil that's the prophet of the hour that's why us we know who we are worshiping we know where we're standing we are not like trying we will know exactly that's why when something happen it's in the message we have all the questions and the answers in the message we don't even need to read other books the message is a book you know me i don't separate the message and the the bible i always say this one book because brother branham preached the the bible didn't preach something and they always said even as angel told me i always bring it to the scripture if it doesn't fit kick it out you're listening out we don't need it so it's a revelation of the bible so where pentecost they don't understand as we understand so we don't have too much question so can you imagine a genuine holy spirit genuinely not another the same holy spirit can anointed if one the genuine holy spirit can anoint a sent one a child of god you see where there is a trouble so if you don't ever ego eyes you'll be troubled some people when they say that past four years me also can just go in the world that pastor can do that me also i can do that it means you and you never believe if you're a believer that's the time you must be more closer to god you know i love those shocking cuts when i read i don't understand it push me down my knees and cry i don't need to understand i need to believe this message was giving to believe it's not for you to understand you can't explain god except god himself entering your heart revealing who he is and you know who you are if god is not to you if he's not in you you can't know even who you are to stand the devil you've got experience of six years six hundred six thousand years you just now but you've got more experience than him when you know who you are you can tell him we created you yeah i was in his mind you know that day he asked job where were you job hallelujah [Applause] don't swallow the punch of the devil give him back taking things he talk more than god god always talk to us in a small voice sometimes we miss him we can pray we don't even have a time just to keep quiet together that's my voice as soon as he's finished to pray okay chantal let us go then let us pray we pray today okay let us go down keep quiet every time quiet time he will always talk to you and when you talk to you you can feel a sweet anointing sweet voice you feel like you can't explain yes tears come down hallelujah glory be to god praise the lord eight one the choice of your conduct good you could you can't mix it now you either for god or against god and the outward expression show exactly what on the inside see they cook about many of you think i got the baptism of the holy ghost i'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and to go to hell the bible said so that's exactly right god blend for the lord praise god praise god so you're asking joseph where are you taking us i'm taking you to the seal praise god baptism and they still are not the same i'm taking you to the cell let me just jump first to go there we can come back you know the word of god are sweet only things you have to do just to drop down your guts even if ask preacher you can have quotations i ever ang where i master brother on whatever is angry master every preacher i've got his anger is master that's why we need to fight for ministry sometimes you can read the bible when the preacher's preaching is like you never read that scripture before it's it's good that's why you you need just to empty to let god speak to you when you have already ideas so you want to find the fault is a lot of faults you're going to find there is a two spirit come on it's because us we are so used to this canal life flesh we forget that we are the spiritual people we are not physical we are not cannon and that spiritual are strong are they that's the reality of you brother one is not this one you see brother one is 20 years inside that's him it's not this just as soon as you go if you ask can you come back i'm not coming back it's like a baby when is in the two in the in the tomb it can be there they say go ah you know when you just born you have that fear nature natural fear when they just think that baby was born with fear from contact of two to sex we came sinners so when the baby can you see the light the moon and you ask the baby can you go back to the home color nice that's that's that's a question they're doing the same thing in when it's heaven it's beautiful seed of glory is beautiful we just sing when you say death it's just a bridge he's a bridge when he's coming god i don't want to go because you don't know where you're going remember hope when she was already there under and brother banham called her and he said promise me are going to marry who can say that sister can say they are going to marry this is another dimension that's why it's beautiful more than the world he said i can't come back that is nonsense so this life and this message are spiritual now when we put in the physical that's why we have a problem when me every at work when is my supervisor they give me trouble i just it's not him the devil already in my enemy i went in the corner i pray i don't have a problem because i'm a i'm an ego i must master all the people you can create when they say you are created you can create atmosphere maybe sometimes i start singing praise god christian praise god they are great atmosphere they laugh and that problem is saying you know i don't just don't follow him you know today is not a good one let us come come help me here you create that atmosphere it's home you create atmosphere at school you it you you can it's because you don't want to do it you can i do it i'm i'm not preaching because of no i'm trying my experience we have more powerful people upon the earth i'm telling you well more powerful people i always tell my wife i said you know what you know those illuminati you hear all those they are babies as we are higher than all power you feel illuminati whatever we are very high you don't know this world still it's still going on because of his children they stay upon the earth god can protect the aeroplane because of you all the aurora plan so don't let the devil tell you you are nothing don't allow him to tell you or not sometimes you can use someone's threat in your in your mouth you are nothing sometimes answer back by voice i'm not nothing you you are nothing you know your hand i'm gonna bind you and in the fire me i'm going to heaven praise clapton for the lord amen praise god i forgot who i am did i read that one i don't know where which number sister you are oh nine okay thank you for reminding me that's all sometimes you go off of subject it's okay okay let us read nine i'm watching the time don't worry that's what the matter we don't get served ah i want to jump something i remember i want to read something i want to go to the last coming today yes where is okay okay i want to read this can you give me a number 12 first we're gonna come back to nine after super wonderful very fast wonderful here friends if you ever was heard if you live long enough you're going to get sick again but if you one time take that token you have it forever grave not the holy spirit of god whereby you were sold until the day of your redemption not to the next revival you wasn't sold you got emotionally wake up but you are dead and your life is hid in god through christ and you are served by the ghost now yes if you were once baptized into the holy spirit now you can backslid that's true but you can't get away from that seal keep my hand for the lord amen amen that's where i'm taking you that's to the seal it's it's it just allah is a language you know but was preaching that i love that the preaching the holy spirit uh get old on you i know you you enjoy it right so you know that holy spirit it's always come to anyone it can get all on you and can leave you now you must be ready when it gets on you you are cleaned for that holy spirit to go to the right place if the holy spirit it's sell you in the spirit it is to a baptism is not yet a seal but the same holy spirit someone can have the whole baptism you see my mama said you cannot touch any hour any minute go to hell you can have that anointing they're genuine and you stoop the devil all those things to me you can't be questioned when you see someone 10 years or 30 and they quit he never believed he never believed the message he confessed he obeyed that scripture next time i'll give you babanam said are you obeying the messenger or are you believing the message some people they obey the messenger they have that love but they don't they mix their way of life with the word of god they become halfway christian hallelujah and god doesn't want them to be halfway but them they mixed with their lives i love i love to read sister nine please because when i say this at this point they always this they always talk things speeches these young creatures i love to read the prophet because we are living the very very dangerous time right now the devil is behind the puppet the devil is in the major the devil is preaching they've got more money than us they can preach they've got anointing when they're preaching the the building can shake more than the genuine one that's why we are living this time is a matthew 24 24 and when we are listening to them be careful when you have a straight you don't have a powerful spirit they can take you to reason they can disturb you don't listen to them don't listen to me sometimes they start nonsense nonsense hallelujah this one yeah yeah i don't have to listen to waste my time you can't convince because even faith is a revelation upon this rock that's the church the church is about revelation when god revealed to you you don't need to go and force someone to be revealed god is going to reveal today today you're going to see like me today no it doesn't work that way god you just pray for him love him you don't know your attitude it can help somebody to come and visit you in the church there is one one chinese god forgive me a church there he called me one day you are different that's me i don't know i'm like yeah you guys you are very different and he started to approach me today he wanted to come but if god can you i was god forgive because i was looking down upon him because most of in chinese they don't even respect the christians so most of the idolatrous so for me this chinese maybe this is one of them it's different he said when people they they they try to do something wrong to you but the way you master them the way you continue to love i don't understand i call him i said i've got a super power oh yeah go leave me to god i know one day i spoke with my wife i told you right he said your husband is i'm not preaching stories that's why i always said uh babam said don't tell people to do things if you can't do it that's why i suffered a lot you know as a pastor let me just sit and sing sometimes it's okay it's okay let's say you i enjoy hear others preaching i hear the anointing i'm doing a lot of missionary work but you have to support your man of god pastor one i'm telling you there's a subject you pass is dry they are reading the message like newspaper said them there is no anointing you do you can't feel that you come out from church it's like they were just reading stuff or this we are preaching is not you to memorize we are trying to make you closer today to the white throne close across and yourself you can pull the blessing it's not about reading reading no i'm reading because it's my first time to preach to you yeah i i'm just read comment behind when you know me i just caught we passed i caught because now people they are preaching for business they just want a lot of people in the church finish when someone give a lot of money they can't anyways their life is nonsense they can't even mention him that's our brother about the holy spirit holy spirit is money before i finish i just uh 3 or 15 minutes but let me just give you one story i'll always like to do to give one story always one pasta in drc is wonderful pastor you've got a beautiful daughter sister now that brother that pastor he is a good pastor yeah wonderful man of god now is dora won't get married one brother came love the lord always want to understand always humble and the pastor look at him he didn't look at that life he just looked at something yeah when my my my my daughter will go with you do you have a good bed i said no god will help you i will go to the house i got something you will eat and sleep but expensive how much did you buy your bed okay i know pasta okay we still have a problem it's all his daughter now one guy came the messages means yeah and come back there it's a pasta brother how are you i'm fine i i'm interesting about you dora and before i talk to her i want first talk to you i said yeah yeah yeah i know him i know him before they talk i saw your your your roof i said no so no tomorrow i'm gonna give you some you're gonna change that but i saw your chair no don't worry about you wanna buy a chair that brother was i don't know brother oh he's a bandit just come the brother married the door the sister the less than uh seven months the brother wasn't a christian he came in the message because in africa he knows that gonna find some young and beautiful they kept themselves and that's why i just came and they found out late and that guy was a witchcraft and they are already in the marriage and the sister already ever she was already pregnant dizzy pastor the brother of the holy spirit you said i said no i was thinking i said no no no you said he has the holy spirit now he messed up the life of his own daughter she he said no no i can't dream my door a day i said we have a scripture to take care of from the marriage because there is no scripture from the marriage because he's a witch there is no scripture he must stay there and die yeah we must have a scripture to to use and if she come out by herself she must stay there until she dies she can't get married ah yes but if she come out he will never get married let's go you sister you you're gonna stay there until rapture is coming soon and if it's 30 years are you sure so that's that's the level of sometimes some churches and the preachers so the when we reach marriage case i always advise young people you must be sincere enough marriage is something you can't play with it because you can reach a level where we can't help you to come out sister eunice we cry for you but you can't come out nothing we can't help you that's why before you enter in make sure god is in it said some they didn't marry their wives but we can't fix it here we're gonna fix it in heaven and even there is no marriage just tell you you you're supposed to marry that one that one but here there is no marriage so the message of the hour it's a wonderful message it teaches for everything you just be honest i always tell people when you have bananas rotten bananas if you want a good bananas draw face the rotten be empty and look for the good bananas not you're playing game you go to boyfriend girlfriend and you want to just to change it from a boyfriend to the good husband or good man it doesn't work that way you must step away you clean yourself you wait seven years up to god ten years up to god i believe god there is one sister in mozambique he was in the church she was a white she said i'm going to wait my my my husband is coming she was there sitting there oh the brother said are you sure one day one preacher from europe kind of preached he said god tell me i must marry her and they got married don't help god put to god just challenge him you must reach in that and then the level what you said is death and the life just like his holy spirit hannah was oh i don't have a baby i don't have a baby i don't have a baby i don't and sometimes that attitude god doesn't like god like you to be positive you don't have a baby yes if it's the perfect will of god to me i don't have a baby i don't care i'm going to heaven glory be to god you know your attitude it's gonna bring take any change sometimes they they always say i don't know i don't want to go with my details next time so anna was one day anna got and it's not even anna go they help anna to god to to to to push her to desperation why she was going and she just look at that another that uh another wife and uh she just looked at her and she was she didn't say anything she just take her baby my baby beautiful thing my baby beautiful you know the women they do she look at that my baby my baby so she fell now a good attitude she didn't go and fight that woman she wanted to kneel down god if you don't give me a baby i'd rather die here desperation oh [Music] she started to pray until her own pastor didn't understand and are you drunk and when she received that message she changed her attitude before even if the baby come praise the lord and i used to always to sing when i want to sing a song [Music] [Music] what happened your attitude most of most of the time don't bring your say the attitude me will never see me that way never even if the things doesn't go right never because that's the way the devil wants you to be that's not the devil they don't want to see you sad always same and when you bring more pressure you just smile i say you look devil you're a small boy i was with god when we created you hallelujah clapton for the lord amen amen us we are the crazy in the lord you know those people in the world they can be in the stadium and they sing us when we come in the front of god we want to be more bosses sister brother we are singing we are not singing for you grab the hand when someone say man what's wrong come on now me i don't care you look at me and i said three times glory be to god praise god that's why god loves david when david reached to worship god he can dance until the suit and the clothes he doesn't care the wife was offended and he was struck and he didn't by balance he didn't have a baby don't play when someone is crazy for god leave him alone okay let me just read let me read this one joseph praise the lord are you happy cleveland for the lord just love the lord praise god i'm going to close with one tips i'm going to give you any tips and i'm going to have to stop musician can come already because i'm reading this and we just pray next time because if i take again if flat when i start to land it will be already 20. so let me start stopping right now praise the lord sister can you go number nine i think we didn't read that one others we i just yeah that's what the matter we don't get so much we too lose about things when the inspector go through to inspect your life the holy spirit always come even if now is around here it's always get old with you always to see if you are not just a little loose about things little rules about your prayer life literal rules about that same power if they just mention your name you are ready to fight me i don't want someone to to my name my name my name you don't know me a sister brother please i'm a christian yes but i'm going to remove my christianity time i put to first here so i'm going to wait after i'm going to help you that temper little knows about that tongue always pet party speak wrong about people you know when you're appointing others there is three fingers pointing to yourself you don't have to remember that when i used to preach that was like this one pasta used now anyone to pointing and now he changed he was pointing like this hallelujah glory be to god for the lord oh my [Applause] to talk about others he will never sell the car someday to habit some five things some are going to mind it can't seal the car i'm taking you to the cells so you will never get away from the self that's where we have to cry we have to pray until you assault baptism yes it's the same baptismal comes if you still lose they don't seal it goes it comes it hold on you yes yes but when it's found clean ready it serves you finish when you grieve it you just go a little bit but it's a mark it's coming back if you always come back and tell if you don't listen god can take you off for the earth before we leave the time that's the problem about the seal because the silicone to go to hell and when someone of god says that the proof is a chair of god because judas also is a preacher one day judas preach and they preach and the preach and the people they got healed and the period wasn't come and convey was not converted he preached they come to jesus i have very happy hallelujah praise god even if the demons are subject down to us i can you say peter was jumping just hey guys come enjoy you must rejoice when your name is written you see it's not about that it's about the sale and one day peter was there and he said he said they never want to shift you and i pray for you for your your your faith doesn't fail he said jesus i can go if you need to to jail me i'm with you jesus pera never understand the mystery until the holy spirit comes oh this is not flesh fight spiritual and was ready even to die for christ so it's not about trying to follow the fruit of the spirit i want to be humble how to be kind no it's
