[21:36] seat for a
[21:38] while

[21:44] uh mentioned last week that brother
[21:47] Steven B was going in for his surgery
[21:50] and by the grace of God he went in and
[21:53] he had a successful surgery praise the
[21:56] Lord and uh uh
[22:00] I happened to speak to his wife
[22:02] yesterday uh I call him because I
[22:06] thought uh sister Cindy was going to uh
[22:09] either be in surgery or out of surgery
[22:12] at the time so I just wanted to check on
[22:15] him to see how she was

[22:32] and wife uh uh went through surgery
[22:36] pretty much the same time but we want to
[22:38] thank the Lord they both surgery went
[22:40] very well and uh uh and uh for for our
[22:45] brother it was it was surely the hand of
[22:48] the Lord because uh uh it was good that
[22:52] uh he choose to go and do the surgery
[22:57] because uh uh uh the doctor found that
[23:01] uh the the cancer was outs outside of
[23:05] his postering and then uh if he wouldn't
[23:09] have gone it would have uh uh it would
[23:12] have been deadly for him so we thank the
[23:15] Lord that uh he went and uh and both of
[23:19] them are doing very well praise the

[49:19] 3 praise the
[49:23] Lord Malachi chapter 3 thank you for
[49:27] coming out uh this uh Wednesday evening
[49:31] for this little time of prayer meeting
[49:34] we do the best we can to let you out
[49:37] here at
[49:39] 9:00 just want to take a tou here uh
[49:43] continuing with what we we uh started on
[49:47] uh
[49:48] Sunday but I want
[49:53] to continue to set uh
[49:57] a foundation
[50:02] year you know sometimes you have you
[50:04] have a talk and it's not actually for
[50:07] you to preach it's for you for you
[50:10] yourself but preachers we always want to
[50:12] preach so whether it's for us or for the
[50:14] people we still preach it
[50:16] anyhow praise the Lord Malachi chapter 3
[50:21] verse1 let's read that
[50:24] together if the the nation can put it up
[50:27] for
[50:28] us behold I send my messenger and he
[50:33] shall prepare the way before me and the
[50:37] Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come
[50:41] to his Temple even the messenger of the
[50:45] Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he
[50:50] shall come said the Lord of host father
[50:54] ask blessing to this word tonight in
[50:56] Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless
[51:00] you you may have your seat now you can
[51:02] realize why when Jesus appeared to Paul
[51:06] on the road of Damascus and he said Paul
[51:09] Paul why or sa sa why persecute thou me
[51:13] he said woman thou because if you read
[51:16] right here in Malachi
[51:20] 3:1 the Lord whom you suddenly seek
[51:24] shall come to his Temple even the
[51:27] messenger of the Covenant so that
[51:30] messenger of the Covenant was the angel
[51:33] of the Lord that led the people L the
[51:35] children of Israel so so when Paul I
[51:39] mean uh being Saul said Lord who are
[51:43] thou and uh and and to his astonishment
[51:47] when when he heard I'm Jesus whom that
[51:50] persecuting it just it just blew him it
[51:53] threw him off of his hearse because uh
[51:56] uh he knew that that pillow of fire uh
[51:59] uh uh uh you know was the injured of the
[52:02] Covenant now so I want us to look at
[52:05] that verse closely once again and and uh
[52:08] behold I send my messenger and he shall
[52:11] prepare the way now uh uh uh uh Sunday
[52:16] we were looking at where Jesus uh uh St
[52:19] John chapter 14:6 he says I am the way
[52:23] the truth and the life praise the Lord
[52:27] now so what what we're trying to to
[52:30] bring out of this is that uh there is a
[52:33] path there is a path it's a supernatural
[52:36] path now if you if you if you listening
[52:39] to the message brother Brandon brother
[52:41] Brandon talk about this I wanted to draw
[52:44] it out and uh maybe we will do that as
[52:46] we we we go he he talks about uh uh I
[52:51] think in the message
[52:54] preparation how internet
[52:57] it's a
[52:58] cycle and he said time is a loop in the
[53:02] cycle praise the Lord am amen now so uh
[53:09] uh what we want to look at tonight uh
[53:12] Jesus said he is the way and yeah the
[53:16] promise there is a promise here of this
[53:19] messenger I will send uh uh uh the Lord
[53:22] saying behold I send my messenger and he
[53:25] shall prepare the way now this is a
[53:28] prophecy that referred to John the
[53:30] Baptist ministry he was that Messenger
[53:33] to prepare the way of the Lord are we
[53:36] together he was the messenger to prepare
[53:39] the way of the Lord now let's look at
[53:42] this uh also when Isaiah speaking about
[53:45] the same promise Isaiah chapter 40 uh uh
[53:49] verse
[53:50] 3-5 let's look at that and see here also
[53:53] we see prepare the way so John was to
[53:56] prepare the way and when Jesus came he
[53:58] says I am the
[54:00] way praise the Lord are you seeing the
[54:03] picture John was to prepare the way and
[54:07] when Jesus came he says I am the way now
[54:10] so uh let's let's read Isaiah chapter
[54:13] 140 uh reading verse uh uh
[54:16] 3-5 also talking about John the Baptist
[54:23] ministry Isaiah chapter 40
[54:27] you have Chapter 30 up it's chapter
[54:34] 14 the voice of him that cry in the
[54:39] wilderness prepared ye the way of the
[54:44] Lord amen amen so we see another prepare
[54:48] so John the Baptist ministry was to
[54:50] prepared but watch this now prepare the
[54:53] way of the Lord make straight
[54:57] in the desert a
[54:59] highway for our God
[55:04] Amen every
[55:06] Valley shall be exalted and every
[55:09] mountains and Hills shall be made Lord
[55:13] and the croak shall be made straight and
[55:17] the rough places plain and the glory of
[55:20] the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh
[55:23] shall see it together for the mouth of
[55:26] the Lord Lord has spoken it praise the
[55:27] Lord so John the Baptist was to prepare
[55:30] the way of the Lord now you can see why
[55:36] the the the entire sahed Council both
[55:39] Sadducees and Pharisees they all miss it
[55:42] because when you make when you make the
[55:46] the promises of
[55:49] God uh so lateral lateral in a sense
[55:54] that uh you don't you don't you don't
[55:56] look at the the the spiritual aspect of
[56:00] it the the the supernatural aspect of
[56:02] Faith because this messenger that is
[56:05] promised to come here the scripture says
[56:08] he was going to make every Valley to be
[56:10] exalted and and and every mountain and
[56:13] Hills uh shall be made Lord and we never
[56:16] saw uh uh John the Baptist going around
[56:19] with a
[56:20] bosm right praise the
[56:23] lord we never saw him going around with
[56:26] with a bulldozer but there is another
[56:28] promise in Malachi 4 that says he will
[56:32] turn the
[56:35] heart so exalting the Low Places and
[56:39] bringing the mountain down they were all
[56:42] things that were going to be done in the
[56:46] human God was going to be dealing with
[56:49] us taking us from our high thoughts our
[56:53] proud nature taking us from our places
[56:56] of of
[56:57] complex praise the
[57:00] Lord amen that's the reason why you see
[57:03] John when he came even those people that
[57:06] thought they could not be touched I mean
[57:09] he spoke to herrow he blasted herodes he
[57:12] blasted the the the Roman soldiers he
[57:14] said you are exploting the
[57:17] people he was dealing with the the the
[57:20] the heart
[57:22] condition praise the Lord so he was to
[57:26] prepare the way of the Lord but it was
[57:29] not a physical path he was not making a
[57:32] highway in Jerusalem for the Messiah to
[57:35] come on but he was preparing the way
[57:39] because the promise here is that the
[57:41] Lord that you suddenly seek will come in
[57:45] his
[57:46] Temple while the Pharisees were waiting
[57:49] for him to come in the temple that Herod
[57:52] buil for them right God was going to
[57:55] come
[57:56] in a temple of a
[57:59] body praise the
[58:02] Lord are you are you getting the picture
[58:05] amen so so you see here that uh and I
[58:09] and I went back and I I look at this
[58:11] word I said a little bit about it on
[58:13] Sunday I look at that word way as I was
[58:16] looking there in the in the concordant
[58:18] study I look at the word way it has uh
[58:22] that that Greek meaning if if uh if I
[58:24] would take people can put that put that
[58:27] up
[58:28] there that Hebrew word and
[58:32] uh if if that's the right pronunciation
[58:35] Derek where Road distance joury
[58:40] manner way it could speak about a road
[58:42] it could be a way it could be a path it
[58:45] could be a journey it could be uh uh
[58:49] directions but pay attention to this one
[58:52] it could also means a manner of life a
[58:59] habit and I
[59:01] think I
[59:04] believe this is what John was coming to
[59:10] prepare
[59:13] amen if his ministry was to turn the
[59:16] hearts
[59:18] of the children back to the father if
[59:21] his ministry was to deal with the heart
[59:23] of the
[59:24] people from Judaism and bring them to
[59:28] what God was
[59:31] doing then his message was going to
[59:34] introduce a manner of Life yes
[59:40] right are we
[59:42] together his message was going to
[59:45] introduce a manner of
[59:52] life he wants to prepare the
[59:54] way now remember remember we says the
[59:57] cherubin was to guide the way to the
[59:59] Tree of Life the pillow of fire led the
[1:00:02] people in the
[1:00:06] way it led him even even beyond all
[1:00:10] their complaining and everything that
[1:00:12] that was God's mercy yes the people that
[1:00:15] were complaining against the leadership
[1:00:17] of God but yet he was still keeping them
[1:00:20] in his
[1:00:21] way how much we see around
[1:00:24] us
[1:00:26] is by the mercy of God we are not
[1:00:31] consumed how can we say we are the Bride
[1:00:33] of Jesus Christ we have the Revival for
[1:00:35] the hour and some of our thoughts are so
[1:00:43] nasty and and and and and and and even
[1:00:46] some of our thoughts we we we we limit
[1:00:50] ourself we think that you know what the
[1:00:53] weight of Holiness you you you got to be
[1:00:56] wretched you got to you got to suffer
[1:00:58] and and just just the
[1:01:01] mindset so you see the the the work of
[1:01:05] the Holy Spirit The Turning of our
[1:01:07] hearts to the hearts of the Father the
[1:01:10] work that God is is is is is is working
[1:01:13] in
[1:01:14] US is to put us on this path give us
[1:01:19] this uh manner of life that brother
[1:01:22] brandham called a bride
[1:01:24] material not just a church member but a
[1:01:28] br material a people that know that
[1:01:31] there is a Rapture a people that are
[1:01:34] expecting a Rapture any moment and
[1:01:36] people that are living daily for a
[1:01:38] Rapture it's a manner of
[1:01:43] life it's not something you can just
[1:01:45] conform to it's a path that God have to
[1:01:49] draw you in something affect your life
[1:01:52] you get on a path amen glory
[1:01:58] amen praise the
[1:02:00] Lord are we together see these people
[1:02:03] walking on a path to a promised
[1:02:08] land they are going to their
[1:02:11] promise the pillow of fire is leading
[1:02:13] them by Night the pillow of cloud by
[1:02:16] day praise the Lord even though they
[1:02:19] eating the man and and all the blessings
[1:02:22] that God is showing them but because
[1:02:24] their heart were not
[1:02:26] converted their heart were not converted
[1:02:29] to believe Moses as the leader they kept
[1:02:32] creating problem a journey That was
[1:02:35] supposed to take them couple of
[1:02:39] Base they had to go for 40 39 years they
[1:02:43] just going in
[1:02:45] cycle so you see their their nature
[1:02:48] their attitude took them off of God's
[1:02:51] way they were walking in their own way
[1:02:55] because of their own desire they wanted
[1:02:57] to go back to
[1:03:00] Egypt are there no garlic in Egypt that
[1:03:03] you brought us in the wilderness they
[1:03:05] see the pillow of Fire by night they can
[1:03:07] see the
[1:03:08] light they can see the glory of
[1:03:12] God but their heart was still in Egypt a
[1:03:16] journey That was supposed to take the
[1:03:18] couple of days they had to be going in
[1:03:20] cycle why because they were not in God's
[1:03:23] path they were in their own path by
[1:03:27] their own
[1:03:29] desires praise the Lord so you see SS of
[1:03:33] God this message is it's not just it's
[1:03:36] not to make uh it's not to make a church
[1:03:39] even no praise the Lord amen it's not to
[1:03:43] make a
[1:03:46] church this is the voice of God to call
[1:03:49] us in the path of God it's a manner of
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:56] it's a manner of life you don't need a
[1:03:58] badge to go to England and tell
[1:04:01] everybody that you are a message
[1:04:02] believer they was your life yes
[1:04:05] siren that's why these early Christian
[1:04:07] they were called they they call this
[1:04:09] thing the way that is called heresy that
[1:04:12] is the way I worship the god of my
[1:04:14] father that way that manner of life that
[1:04:17] people speak against that's what I'm

[1:04:47] because because they were not in the way
[1:04:49] of God they were not in his path they

[1:04:54] oh if the zah come he will come to the
[1:04:57] temple he will come to meet caii the
[1:04:59] high

[1:05:03] will seek he will suddenly come to his
[1:05:06] Temple you're thinking about a physical
[1:05:10] Temple why John message was to prepare a
[1:05:15] temple amen amen
[1:05:17] amen praise the Lord that's the reason
[1:05:20] why when Jesus came there at Jordan and
[1:05:23] he baptized and Jesus when walking out
[1:05:26] of the water he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:05:28] God that takes away he was identifying
[1:05:32] the temple he was identifying the one
[1:05:35] that the Lord that you seek suddenly has
[1:05:38] come endure in but everybody was just
[1:05:40] telling whoa that c son that guy fed a
[1:05:43] bench for

[1:06:06] picture so this
[1:06:08] way who means a manner of Life a
[1:06:14] habit it could mean a course of
[1:06:17] life it could mean moral and
[1:06:22] character
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:27] and I
[1:06:30] think that's what it is
[1:06:33] here that's what I'm beginning to see
[1:06:35] let's let's just R few things here uh uh
[1:06:38] before we close tonight I I say I will
[1:06:40] let us go home at 9:00 amen praise the
[1:06:46] Lord Brother brand said this in perfect
[1:06:49] strength in perfect weakness let's read
[1:06:51] it
[1:06:54] together
[1:06:59] notice that it
[1:07:01] takes the the weakest and
[1:07:04] rejected and practically every hero God
[1:07:09] ever had in the front line was that type
[1:07:13] of person that's why brother BR says
[1:07:16] Mo Samson was not a muscle man right yes
[1:07:21] he was just a a little weakling boy with
[1:07:25] seven love BL hanging on his
[1:07:27] head praise the Lord David was just a
[1:07:31] Shepherd
[1:07:33] boy no military
[1:07:35] skills sh guy took a
[1:07:39] bone praise the Lord think about it
[1:07:43] that's that's the mystery of God that's
[1:07:46] God's
[1:07:48] mystery that he took weak
[1:07:51] things and he put Heavenly treasure in
[1:07:54] it
[1:07:59] amen he took weak things
[1:08:03] amen praise the Lord and they always
[1:08:06] tell you
[1:08:08] that if you want to hide thing the best
[1:08:11] way to hide face yes
[1:08:15] sir highly in the more common place
[1:08:18] right because it's so common they will
[1:08:21] not look
[1:08:24] there praise the Lord the best way to
[1:08:28] hide things put it in the more common
[1:08:35] place are we
[1:08:41] together the weakest and rejected
[1:08:43] practically every hero God ever had on
[1:08:47] the front line was that type of person a
[1:08:50] person that was rejected a
[1:08:53] person that thought he was
[1:09:00] insufficient praise the Lord you see
[1:09:02] that's the reason why for God to bring
[1:09:06] an elect of every age he had to use full
[1:09:10] generation he drew you through the
[1:09:12] strains of four generation and that four
[1:09:15] generation your father grandfather great
[1:09:20] grandfather all of those things create
[1:09:23] the complexes that we deal with that's
[1:09:25] what made your spirit your spirit
[1:09:29] man is drawn through
[1:09:35] that are we
[1:09:37] together why because God was going to
[1:09:41] hide himself in there that if he did not
[1:09:44] show you you will not even find him in
[1:09:46] you that's
[1:09:48] right if God don't reveal it to you you
[1:09:51] will never believe you have the Holy
[1:09:52] Ghost that's
[1:09:54] right if he don't reveal it to you you
[1:09:56] will never believe that you are a child
[1:09:58] of God because there is just so much in
[1:10:01] our mind that happen in our body daily
[1:10:04] that is enough to condemn
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:11] you are we
[1:10:15] together every person that God every
[1:10:19] person that was rejected a person that
[1:10:21] thought he was
[1:10:23] insufficient a person that had no
[1:10:26] ability at
[1:10:29] all then that
[1:10:34] person just in a good shape so God can
[1:10:38] start using him right praise the Lord
[1:10:42] amen but you see our mind struggle with
[1:10:46] that because our mind tells us we must
[1:10:50] be our
[1:10:53] best are we together
[1:10:56] praise the Lord so when whenever we are
[1:10:59] not our best the enemy comes right in
[1:11:01] there he condemn
[1:11:03] you praise the Lord amen say you're not
[1:11:08] even wanted to go in the presence of God
[1:11:10] you are just a storing black you are a
[1:11:14] hypocrite
[1:11:16] my and then we are we I mean we are
[1:11:18] overtaken by that oh my God I'm a
[1:11:20] hypocrite I'm a hindrance to the church
[1:11:22] oh my
[1:11:24] God may God help us
[1:11:29] amen a person that was rejected a person
[1:11:32] that thought he was
[1:11:33] insufficient a person that had no
[1:11:36] ability at all then that person just in
[1:11:39] a good shape so God can start using him
[1:11:44] that's right is when they feel like they
[1:11:50] can they haven't got nothing that's when
[1:11:54] God can take a hold of
[1:11:57] them and do something with them praise
[1:12:02] the Lord am God don't want your ability
[1:12:07] he want you to be available
[1:12:10] sir amen amen glory amen he don't want
[1:12:14] your ability but he want you to be
[1:12:18] available and say if you can use
[1:12:20] anything Lord you can use
[1:12:24] me
[1:12:31] praise the Lord is the mystery of our
[1:12:34] journey is the mystery of our life
[1:12:38] that's what we will deal with until we
[1:12:40] get a body change Lord that's what we
[1:12:43] will deal with until we get out of here
[1:12:46] praise the Lord amen oh does that mean
[1:12:50] that God don't want his children to be
[1:12:52] up and doing no he want us to be up in
[1:12:58] doing because he says we must
[1:13:01] replenish it means to be
[1:13:04] fruitful amen it means to be up and
[1:13:07] doing but if we are up and doing we are
[1:13:10] not relying on our ability we are not
[1:13:14] building h h h h just in our own mind we
[1:13:17] are trusting that God will be reflected
[1:13:20] in whatever we are
[1:13:22] doing by his grace amen are we together
[1:13:27] amen let's let's run through
[1:13:29] here love the Lord
[1:13:31] tonight
[1:13:33] amen when God can can can can can take a
[1:13:37] hold of them and do something with them
[1:13:39] but when we are thinking that we are
[1:13:42] able to do
[1:13:43] it then God can use us because we are
[1:13:48] wanting to do it
[1:13:50] ourselves praise the Lord that's the
[1:13:53] reason why there is a room at the cross
[1:13:55] for you whenever we made mistake go
[1:13:57] straight to the Cross praise the Lord
[1:14:00] and say Lord I need you amen the only
[1:14:03] reason why I made mistake because I
[1:14:05] tried to do it my own right amen I I put
[1:14:08] it back in your hands you take complete
[1:14:10] control and then start from right there
[1:14:12] and start
[1:14:18] running and then
[1:14:21] ourself we get these feelings and we
[1:14:24] think
[1:14:26] then that we are
[1:14:27] insufficient and we don't want to do it
[1:14:31] because we feel like we are insufficient
[1:14:33] we look at our abilities we feel like we
[1:14:36] are insufficient we are not
[1:14:38] qualified uh uh uh uh so we don't want
[1:14:41] to do it what what actually happening is
[1:14:43] that you will see right under this Cod
[1:14:46] that's where brother Brandon brought
[1:14:47] that statement of mastering human
[1:14:50] ability praise the Lord and the thought
[1:14:53] behind it there is that you have to know
[1:14:56] yourself you have to know yourself there
[1:14:58] is no there is no uh uh uh uh playing
[1:15:02] game about it you got you have to Know
[1:15:04] Yourself Praise the Lord because why the
[1:15:08] enemy he steing you yes he's telling us
[1:15:13] he know how our mind
[1:15:16] runs a common proof of it is your cell
[1:15:21] phone your cell phone pick up your
[1:15:23] search the things you search for
[1:15:28] constantly it picks it up so what what
[1:15:31] as soon as you go there you start to

[1:15:42] thought party because it knows what you

[1:15:48] day that's how our mind
[1:15:51] runs amen and the enemy know how our
[1:15:56] iRun so if he can just if he can just

[1:16:04] corner and says I'm nothing then he keep

[1:16:23] channel praise the lord it's just a
[1:16:26] channel he open the floor Gates of every
[1:16:29] negative and nasty Spirit to run through

[1:16:39] midst of that you can slam the
[1:16:43] door amen you can slam the door and says

[1:16:56] slam that door
[1:16:59] close praise the
[1:17:05] Lord sometimes it's hard to
[1:17:08] do sometimes it's hard to do why

[1:17:15] go through that you have to now confess
[1:17:18] your sin you go talk to the pastor you

[1:18:26] breathe and then he says the other side
[1:18:30] so he's giving us the other picture now
[1:18:32] dealing with ourself the other side we
[1:18:36] get these feelings and we think then
[1:18:39] that we are insufficient and we don't
[1:18:41] want to do it but then if we just
[1:18:46] listen to the call of God praise the
[1:18:50] Lord your mind is telling you you can do
[1:18:54] it your your heart is Desiring to do
[1:18:59] it praise the Lord amen

[1:19:20] God praise the
[1:19:23] Lord are we together

[1:19:29] worthy but your heart says Lord I need
[1:19:32] help
[1:19:34] Amen brother say listening to the call
[1:19:37] of God that's the way that's the very
[1:19:41] thing that God want us to get into now
[1:19:45] underline that into now because that's
[1:19:48] the way that's the
[1:19:51] channel oh I pray that the Lord will be
[1:19:53] able to help us
[1:19:55] there's a thought that yeah I pray that
[1:19:57] the Lord will help us let's let's just
[1:19:58] read yet a little bit before our time
[1:20:01] goes you said that that he says that's
[1:20:04] the very thing that God want us to get
[1:20:07] into that kind of a spear ship amen so
[1:20:12] we
[1:20:13] can when we are insufficient ourself
[1:20:18] then we are subject to
[1:20:21] yield to God what what is that healing
[1:20:25] to
[1:20:26] God what is that healing you hear you he
[1:20:29] bre B says I just I want to get out of
[1:20:32] the
[1:20:33] way what is that getting out of the way

[1:20:58] language look there there is a
[1:21:01] channel whenever the Holy Spirit comes

[1:21:10] call Jacob ladder yes sir that ladder
[1:21:13] that ascended up to heaven where he saw
[1:21:16] angels were ascending and

[1:26:58] you something to think
[1:27:02] about so it's not it's not Yoga Yoga

[1:27:39] myself yield myself to the Holy Ghost
[1:27:42] Holy Ghost take complete control yield
[1:27:45] myself just put a promise on your
[1:27:53] mind
[1:27:54] and and and when you are thinking on
[1:27:56] that promise it will lead to another
[1:27:59] promise it will lead to another promise
[1:28:02] and the thought of promise to promise
[1:28:04] will start creating an atmosphere
[1:28:08] around
[1:28:16] amen but when we when we get to a place
[1:28:18] where we we can do it we hear ourself
[1:28:21] and he does it so then if
[1:28:24] so then if it's us trying to do it it
[1:28:30] trying to do it we will fail but if we
[1:28:34] just yield ourself to God then God can
[1:28:38] fail let's go to the path of Life five
[1:28:41] minutes and I close now listen to this
[1:28:43] now I'm closing my
[1:28:48] Bible but D always say I say I'm
[1:28:53] closing praise the lord we going to

[1:28:57] this coming
[1:28:59] weekend haven't seen that seen that guy
[1:29:01] for a little while yet now path of life
[1:29:04] let's read this brother brandham says
[1:29:05] listen to this he
[1:29:08] says and brother and
[1:29:12] sister I was I was playing this
[1:29:17] message and I was just thinking on this
[1:29:19] entire subject I don't know I'm I'm I'm
[1:29:23] struggling to bring it to you the way it
[1:29:25] came to me and when brother Brandon
[1:29:28] started to say this I just I just
[1:29:30] bursted and started
[1:29:32] crying because it's it just I just said
[1:29:36] Lord that's exactly what I want that is
[1:29:39] what you want me to see I don't know if
[1:29:41] you would see it but let's read it
[1:29:43] together and brothers and sisters we
[1:29:45] can't afford to let people that we
[1:29:48] love people that we love and people who
[1:29:52] Christ died for
[1:29:55] get away from this
[1:29:58] life to die without eternal
[1:30:02] life let's do
[1:30:04] everything we can to get them into that
[1:30:10] place where that they can rise again in
[1:30:15] the
[1:30:16] resurrection thou will show me the path
[1:30:19] of life I don't want to come in because
[1:30:22] of time let's read the next one you
[1:30:24] Brethren are able to do it to your
[1:30:29] congregation I don't have that
[1:30:33] ability I have no ability listen to this
[1:30:36] now but a little gift that was given to
[1:30:41] me like to pull myself into a certain
[1:30:46] gear the ability that he had to pull
[1:30:51] himself into a certain gear
[1:30:55] the ability he had to to be
[1:30:59] attentive to pull himself into a certain
[1:31:02] gear
[1:31:06] listen that's where the people what they
[1:31:10] are thinking what they are doing and
[1:31:14] what should be done there a little
[1:31:18] way of my
[1:31:21] Ministry is just one of the little path
[1:31:25] that God let me
[1:31:28] use to bring his
[1:31:31] children over to that
[1:31:37] side that's why he could stand there
[1:31:39] before this person and tell
[1:31:42] them that that Grace of gift that was
[1:31:46] given him when he goes into that gear I
[1:31:49] seen you as a little child I see you in
[1:31:51] the
[1:31:52] hospital and the do said this to you
[1:31:56] what it does is that it takes that
[1:31:59] person entire
[1:32:01] spirit and he sit there and says that's
[1:32:08] truth if this man can tell
[1:32:11] me it takes them in a path of
[1:32:16] healing and he said we can do the same
[1:32:20] we don't have that prophetic gift but we
[1:32:23] can be salty yes sir we can be
[1:32:29] nice we don't have to be like Jehovah
[1:32:32] Witnesses H uh taking our Bibles and
[1:32:35] going around the street to tell people
[1:32:37] the kingdom is coming right just your
[1:32:40] manner of
[1:32:43] Life a life of
[1:32:49] consecration where somebody can say
[1:32:51] there is something about you
[1:32:54] yes it's an opportun opportunity to tell
[1:32:57] them that thing about you that is not me
[1:33:04] yes it's not me why are you always
[1:33:07] dressed like
[1:33:11] this a channel has been
[1:33:19] open praise the Lord Brother B said we
[1:33:22] cannot afford to to to allow the people
[1:33:26] that we love we have made the thing so
[1:33:29] much about religion people got to
[1:33:31] believe that brother Brandon is a
[1:33:33] prophet God sent us a prophet who gave
[1:33:35] you that
[1:33:37] commission who make it your ministry to
[1:33:40] go and tell that God sent a
[1:33:42] prophet we say oh even just like that
[1:33:45] little girl in Syria she said there was
[1:33:47] a prophet there was an opportunity that
[1:33:50] presented
[1:33:52] itself
[1:33:54] that's why the prophet of God will say
[1:33:55] when you meet the newspaper Man start
[1:33:57] talking about what is on the
[1:33:59] news and wait for the opportunity to
[1:34:02] present itself
[1:34:04] yes
[1:34:10] Glory talk to your friends about work
[1:34:13] just looking for that opportunity to
[1:34:15] present itself praise the Lord that
[1:34:18] opportunity will never present itself in
[1:34:20] Gossip forget about it it will never
[1:34:22] present itself in Gossip
[1:34:24] because God is not about destroying
[1:34:32] people we we can be a we can be a
[1:34:35] powerful
[1:34:36] witness but like I said on Sunday
[1:34:39] there's a
[1:34:40] price there's a price you can't be
[1:34:43] careless about it it comes with a life
[1:34:46] of
[1:34:49] consecration there's a
[1:34:52] price
[1:34:54] but you see we can pull people into that
[1:34:57] channel that's all this message is about
[1:35:00] that's the purpose of Jesus Christ to
[1:35:03] come and get Sons and Daughters back on
[1:35:05] the path of God
[1:35:07] again not to build churches not to build
[1:35:10] denomination where we just forcing and
