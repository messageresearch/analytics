TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the original manuscripts were written in the aramaic which was the language of jesus and the people of his day it is claimed by them that the people did not speak and write in the greek as is so commonly supposed and the fact is our historians are divided on that for example dr schoenfield a most brilliant student has from research proved to his satisfaction that the new testament was written in the vernacular of the greek speaking people of that day he builds up a fine case for his beliefs based on the various documents at his disposal but on the other hand we have another renowned student dr lomsa who is convinced that the new testament was written in the aramaic and he has none other than the brilliant historian toynbee to back up his contention that the aramaic and not the greek was the language of the people so it seems possible that the new testament was first written in the aramaic however before we get too concerned about this let us read both the king james version and the translation by dr lomsa to our gratification we find the words in both amazingly the same so that there is no difference actually in content or doctrine we may even conclude that god has allowed these newly discovered manuscripts and recent publications of already known scripts to come before us to prove the authenticity of what we already had and we find that though translators may fight each other scripts do not now you can see that you can't base interpretation upon students profound knowledge of the language the bible is written in but if you still can't see that because you are veiled in your mind by tradition here is one last illustration no one can doubt but what the scribes and pharisees and the great scholars of the year 33 a knew the exact laws of grammar and the exact meanings of the words in which the old testament was written but for all their superb knowledge they missed the revelation of god's promised word manifested in the sun there he was set forth from genesis to malachi with whole chapters devoted to him and his ministry and yet except for a few who were illuminated by the spirit they missed him entirely we now come to a conclusion such conclusion as we have already found in the word as much as we believe in trying to find the oldest and best manuscripts to get the best record of the word possible we will never get the true meaning of it by study and comparison of scriptures sincere as we may be it will take a revelation from god to bring it out that is exactly what paul said which things we also speak not in words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth first corinthians 2 15. the true revelation is god interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promised now don't let anyone be misled by what i have said and think that i do not believe in the accuracy of the word as we now have it i believe this bible is accurate jesus completely authenticated the old testament when here on earth and it was compiled exactly as was our new testament make no mistake about it we have the infallible word of god today and no man dares take from it or add to it but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us oh how we need revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and i am not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank god we can have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the living word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify god our father in heaven loosed from sin revelation 1 5 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood the word washed is actually loosed loosed us from our sins in his own blood isn't that wonderful but are you spiritual minded did you catch it it was his own blood that loosed us completely from our sins it was not human blood it was the blood of god peter called it the blood of christ paul called it the blood of the lord and the blood of jesus not three persons but one person there is that revelation again one god that omnipotent jehovah god came down and made himself a body by means of the virgin birth and indwelted that it might be the blood of god that would free us loose us entirely from our sins and present a spotless before himself with exceeding great joy would you like an old testament type let us go back to the garden of eden when the first news came to glory that the son adam had been lost did god send an angel did he send a son did he send another one like unto us no he came himself to redeem that lost son hallelujah god did not entrust his plan of salvation to another he trusted only himself god was made flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us unto himself we are saved by the blood of god the eternal god indwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it consider this since it is the blood of god it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the losing is perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth declares us righteous who is he that condemneth it is christ that died romans 8 33-34 there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation how can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood now don't get tied down again by traditions and creeds and organizations don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that jesus saves heals fills with the holy ghost and power you are god's free man loosed by his own blood if you still hold your faith to creeds and denominations it is certain by the evidence that you have lost your faith in the word kings and priests revelation 1 6 and he hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he he have made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the lord all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are kings spiritual kings oh we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom it says in romans 5 17 for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ and in colossians 1 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and made us priests yes priests unto him offering the spiritual praise of sanctified blips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and kings unto our god no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are a peculiar people zealous unto good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father the coming god revelation 1 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen he is coming jesus is coming god is coming the prophet is coming the priest and king is coming be all in all is coming even so lord jesus come quickly amen he is coming he is coming in clouds clouds of glory as when he was seen upon the mount of transfiguration and his garments were shining as the power of god unfolded him and every eye shall see him that means this is not the rapture this is when he comes to take over his rightful place as world ruler this is when those who have pierced him with their creeds and denominational doctrines shall mourn and all the people shall wail in terror because of him who is the word this is the revelation story of zechariah 12 9-14 zechariah prophesied this about 2500 years ago it is just about to take place listen and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced now when is the gospel returning to the jews when the day of the gentiles is finished the gospel is ready to go back to the jews oh if i could just tell you something that is about to happen right in this our day this great thing that is about to happen will carry over to revelation 11 and pick up those two witnesses those two prophets moses and elijah turning the gospel back to the jews we're ready for it everything is in order as the jews brought the message to the gentiles even so the gentiles will take it right back to the jews and the rapture will come now remember what we have read in revelation and zechariah both come right after the tribulation the church of the firstborn does not go through the tribulation we know that the bible teaches that at that time it says that god is going to pour out his spirit upon the house of israel it is the same spirit that was poured upon the gentiles in their day and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and they shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day shall there be a great morning in jerusalem as the mourning of hadadrimon in the valley of magiddon and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of david apart and their wives apart the family of the house of nathan apart and their wives apart and each one of the houses apart when he comes in clouds of glory at his second coming those jews that pierced him shall see him as it says in another scripture whence did you get those wounds and he'll say in the house of my friends not only will it be a mournful time for the jews who rejected him as messiah but it will be a mournful time for those left of the gentiles who have rejected him as the savior of this day there will be weeping and wailing the sleeping virgins will be wailing they represent the church that refuse to get oil symbol of the holy spirit in their lamps symbol of the body or holder of the oil until it was too late it wasn't that they were not good people they were virgins and that signifies a high moral order but they didn't have oil in their lamps so they were cast out where there was wailing and gnashing of teeth let us type this all out in genesis chapter 45 where joseph meets his brethren in egypt and reveals himself to them genesis 45 1-7 then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years into which there shall neither be earring nor harvest and god sent me before you to preserve your posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance now doesn't that compare with zechariah 12 just beautifully putting the two together we are bound to get it exactly right when joseph was very young he was hated by his brethren why was he hated by his brethren it was because he was spiritual he couldn't help seeing those visions nor could he help dreaming dreams and interpreting that was in him he could not display anything else but what was in him therefore when his brothers hated him it was without cause but he was the beloved of his father his father was a prophet and understood that makes a perfect type of christ god the father loved the son but the brethren scribes and pharisees hated him because he could heal the sick do miracles and foretell the future see visions and interpret them that was no reason to hate him but they did and like joseph's brethren they hated him without a cause now remember how those sons of jacob treated joseph they cast him into a pit they took his coat of many colors that his father had given him and dipped it in blood to make his father think that the boy was killed by some animal they sold him to some slave traders who took him into egypt and there he was resold to a general the general's wife had him falsely imprisoned but after some time his ability as a prophet brought him to the attention of pharaoh and he was exalted to the right hand of pharaoh with such authority that none could approach pharaoh unless he came first through joseph now let us examine the life of joseph while he was in egypt for it is here we see him as the perfect type of christ while in the house of the general he was falsely accused punished and imprisoned without a cause just like they did to jesus there in prison he interpreted the dream of the butler and baker who were also prisoners with him the butler was restored to life but the other condemned to death christ was imprisoned on the cross forsaken by god and man on either side of him was a thief one died spiritually but the other was granted life and notice when jesus was taken off the cross he was exalted into heaven and now sits at the right hand of the great spirit of jehovah and no man can come to god except by him there is one mediator between god and men and he is all you need there are no mary's or saints just jesus keeping on with this type we find in joseph notice how that everything he did in egypt prospered his first job with the general prospered even the jail prospered when jesus returns the desert will blossom as a rose he is the son of prosperity as no age ever prospered as the one under joseph so there is a time of such blessing coming on this earth as the world has never known we can every one of us sit under our own fig tree and laugh and rejoice and live forever in his presence in his presence is fullness of joy and on his right hand there are pleasures forevermore praise god now notice that everywhere joseph went they sounded a trumpet to announce his arrival the people would scream bow the knee to joseph no matter what a man was doing when that trumpet sounded he bowed the knee he could have been selling something in the street just reaching out for his money but he had to stop and bend the knee when that trumpet blew if he were even a performer or an actor he would have to stop his act and bow the knee to joseph when his presence was announced with that trumpet call and one of these days everything in time will stand still when the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise and mourning will break eternal bright and fair everything will bow the knee then for it is written wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name but at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father philippians 2 9-11 but notice another glorious revelation in this typing of joseph joseph while in egypt was given a gentile bride and through her he received a family of two sons ephraim and manasseh joseph asked his father to bless the two boys he placed them in front of jacob so that manasseh the firstborn would be on jacob's right and ephraim to the left as jacob was about to bless them he crossed his hand so that the right hand fell upon the younger joseph cried out not so father this is the firstborn to your right but jacob said god crossed my hands here in type we see that the blessing which belonged to the firstborn the jew was given over to the younger the gentile through the cross crossed hands of the lord jesus christ the blessing comes through the cross galatians 3 13-14 christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith the blessing of abraham came through the cross to the gentiles the jews rejected the cross therefore jesus got the gentile bride now getting back to the story of joseph meeting his brethren you recall that not all the brethren came joseph knew that and insisted that all the brethren appear before him or he could not make himself known unto them finally they brought the one that was missing little benjamin it was little benjamin the full brother of joseph that set his soul on fire and when our joseph even jesus will come to the people who have kept the commandments of god and who have gone back to palestine his soul will be set on fire little benjamin typifies the 144 000 israelites from all over the earth who have gone back to palestine for their redemption they will be standing there ready to receive him whom to know a right is life eternal they will say this is our god for whom we have waited then they will see him whom they have pierced and they will cry out in dismay where did these awful wounds come from how did it happen and they will wail and cry every family apart everyone apart in the agony of sorrow now where will the gentile church be while jesus is making himself known to his brethren remember that the bride of joseph with the two children were in the palace for joseph had commanded let everyone leave me put them all out from before me so the gentile bride was hidden in the palace of joseph where will the gentile church go in the rapture into the palace the bride will be taken off the earth she will be caught up before the great tribulation to meet her lord in the air for three and one half years while the retributive wrath of god is poured out she will be in the great marriage supper of the lamb then will he return leaving his bride in his father's house while he makes himself known to his brethren at this very time the antichrist covenant that the jews have made with rome will be broken rome and her allies then send their troops to destroy all the god-fearing word abiding jews but as they come against the city to destroy it there will appear in the heavens the sign of the coming of the son of man with his mighty armies to destroy them who have been destroying the earth with the enemy repulsed jesus then comes and presents himself to the 144 thousand having seen his mighty acts of salvation they have come to know his power but also seeing his wounds and knowing that they had rejected him even to that moment causes them to cry out in the agony of terror and fear even as did their brethren of old when they stood before joseph being sore afraid that they would be killed but as joseph said don't be angry with yourselves it is all right god was in it all he did it to preserve life even so will jesus speak peace and love to them why did the jews reject jesus god was in it all it was the only way that he could bring out the gentile bride he died on the cross to preserve the life of the gentile church now these one hundred forty four thousand are not in the bride in revelation fourteen four they are called virgins and they follow the lamb whether so ever he goeth the fact that they have not defiled themselves with women shows that they are eunuchs matthew 19 12. the eunuchs were the keepers of the bridal chambers they were attendants notice that they do not sit in the throne but are before the throne no they are not in the bride but will be in the glorious millennial reign we then see that when these last of israel have been joined in love to the lord and the enemy has been destroyed god will prepare his holy mountain his new garden of eden for the bride and his and her attendants for the thousand-year honeymoon upon the earth as adam and eve were in the garden and did not finish out the thousand years now jesus our last adam and his eve true church will fulfill all the plan of god oh how the bible repeats itself the scene of joseph and his brethren is about to be repeated for jesus is coming soon and as we leave the type of joseph there is one more thing i want to bring to your attention about this end time you recall that as joseph stood before his brethren when benjamin was not with them he spoke through an interpreter though he knew the hebrew well he spoke to his brethren in another tongue did you know that the first gentile age the head of gold babylonian age went out with a message in tongues written on a wall this age is going out the same way the abundance of tongues in this day is a further proof that the times of the gentiles is over and god is turning back to israel he is coming soon the alpha and omega the prophet priest and king be all in all lord god of hosts is coming soon even so lord jesus the one and only true god come quickly chapter 2 the patmos vision revelation 1 9-20 john on patmos revelation 1 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ this series of visions of the revelation of the person of jesus christ was given to john while he was banished to the isle of patmos this small island is 30 miles off the coast of asia minor in the aegean sea being rocky and infested with snakes lizards and scorpions it had little commercial value so it was used by the roman empire for a penal colony where were housed the more desperate criminals political prisoners etcetera you will notice that john has addressed himself to the christians as a brother in tribulation it was at this time that the early church was going through great persecutions their religion was not only everywhere spoken against but the people themselves were imprisoned and killed john like multitudes of others was now suffering imprisonment for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ when arrested they tried in vain to kill him by boiling him in oil for 24 hours the enraged and powerless officials then sentenced him to patmos as a witch but god was with him and he was spared to leave the island and return to ephesus where he again continued his pastor until the time of his death the visions that john received covered a period of two years a.d 95 through 96. they are the most remarkable of all visions in the word the entire book is set forth in symbols and therefore is the target of much criticism and dispute however it does have the seal of god upon it that makes it authentic and of tremendous value to all who read or listen to its sacred pages in the spirit on the lord's day revelation 1 10 i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet i was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my i love that you could just call those words the whole of the christian life if we are going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit john was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these visions it had to be the spirit of god it has to be the spirit of god with us too or all our efforts are in vain paul said i will pray in the spirit i will sing in the spirit i will live in the spirit if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears as surely as john needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous revelations fresh from jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that god has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit look at it this way all too many read the bible where it says in acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the holy spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and then god would be duty bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the holy ghost they never get in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to god for a revelation by his spirit that is the first step get in the spirit let me just use another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we have all read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask god for his spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit it is all over there is no other court of appeal god will fulfill his word oh we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers old dried up sticks they enter right into the feel of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate the christians for getting into the spirit of god's word they call us fanatics and holy rollers there is nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it is coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures both christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh now it says that john was in the spirit on the lord's day [Music] so [Music] my [Music] you
