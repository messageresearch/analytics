about independence that's what we think about remain that we are glad that we found out that he could bring us out Amy praise the Lord praise the Lord once again we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus thank you better area for stepping in and helping this morning praise the Lord this morning I want to I want speak on a little thought that came to my mind but my inspiration will be the position of the bride to this present world with everything that is going on what is our position what why are we here for why God has kept us in such a time that's why we will be speaking about but we will take our our inspiration from the book of 1st Samuel so I will title my message the Beauty and the Beast that's what I would touch on my message praise the Lord and I will remind you of your childhood book but there is good praise Lord when I taught on this speaking on this actually I went to look for that little book the Beauty and the Beast and I have me and my little girl watch it so you know when I'm coming from this morning in me and coming from a little cat unum I want to speak on the beauty of the beast the Beauty and the Beast now as I said in Isaiah chapter 4 the prophecy of seven women we take hold of one man but in verse two he said the branch of the Lord will be beautiful so this this there's a group that will spring out there will be a branch that will spring out right in that time that we have such a beauty her beauty will now be an outdoor presentation her beauty will be such a character that she would bring in this difficult time because the time of seven women taking the hold of one man saying we will have our own food we'll have our own apparel is the presentation of the seven Church ages that has come to the World Council of Churches so in this time in that period of time there is there is a branch that will spring out that will be beautiful so it's that branch her position in this time of chaos I mean is in such a time word like looking at as I a prophecy in this time were I believe as I coming out with that with their prophecies everybody's thinking wow I mean it's really going to be serious I mean seven women are we going to go to war or what is going to happen you know are they going to kill all our men you know that women will be in you know in such a desperate state but we know that it was a prophecy that I was speaking about a time when Israel or when the church would drift away from the Word of God you know they we don't do we want they would want their own appealing gospel you know like brother Branham said in thinking's man feather you know they want something that will be able to appear to them that we get away from the world the Council of Churches has given them you know their doctrine in the sense that they have to follow everything that in economica Council has set together you know if you don't believe in a Trinity you cannot be part of that Council so they have their own bread you know and they have their own presentation which is their apparel but in that time in that very same time there is going to be a branch of the Lord that will be beautiful so that's what we want to look at this morning we want to look at their branch of the Lord so seeing that that description of as I'm false in Revelation chapter 3 the age of loud assured and if there is ever a time where the world has come to a beast condition is this time you know it's this time word I mean well I mean the heart of man and it's it's all because the Holy Spirit is leaving the earth you know when the Holy Spirit was moving around the earth even even sinners even sinners God could touch the conscience of sinners for them to realize you know I mean people will be will be you know still drunken and smoking and yet you could tell them something about the love of God you know they will be drawing in tears who comes from come from the eyes I remember many years back when we first gave our heart to the Lord we used to do Street witnessing so one night after service we went into the street to witness and I still remember this it stand out to me because one of the local church back home they had the assembly right on their Street word is happen it was in the night and you know that pitch black because there's no electricity you know so I broke away from the brothers and I decided I was going to go on my own then I to to just to witness to testify to someone and as I was walking in this dark Street only thing I could see coming down the road was was a man smoking I don't know how he looks like because I couldn't see his face I can just see the real light from his mouth you know faith man he put it down put it back to his mouth he put it down and I was going straight in his direction I'll break myself of young man at the time I'll just walk straight in his direction and I can tell you I would not I would not want to say the man came on a strong conviction that he had met an angel he was scary because it was that didn't know who I was and I - I say young man I was scary because I didn't know who he was you know so I walked straight to him and I just I stood before him and he stopped and he had his his cigarette there so I told him you know what I you know I want to push to you tonight I want to tell you about the love of God do you know that is you know just young young young a Christian at a time you know the cigarette is not good for you you know and and I preached to him and you know the Lord Jesus is coming back soon II what I was talking to him I mean he just dropped his cigarette on the ground I don't know whether he did it or fear of conviction but you know it was good that I mean he spared their stick what he lied another one later well the Lord knows the rest of the story but you know in the end of time of the revival when when I mean when when the Holy Ghost was moving on the earth like you see it on the days of Pentecost and even you know when when when man like a a aliens and different revivalist was moving around the country you know brother branham having this meeting even those people you know they were not fully convicted but because the Holy Spirit was here I mean it had it brought some sense of sanity to people's mind you know they could they could have a little sense of discernment between right and wrong but we're living in such a time because that spirit is leaving the earth before we read a scripture I have you stand let's just let's just do something little this morning in a book of it please TRC don't stand we're not reading the scripture here I'm trying to do this to have my step going so les [Music] chapter 3 Ecclesiastes chapter 3 let's let's look at something there [Music] being reading this book at home and they also helped me to kind of be revealing some few things now in Chapter three you realize that's where Solomon said to everything there is a season and a time and a purpose under the heaven praise the Lord but in a verse 11 he says this speaking about the Lord he have made everything beautiful in his time also he have said the word in the heart so that no man can find out the work that God make it from the beginning to the end now if you if you study this you realize that this word the Solomon is talking about here it speaks about internetting it speaks that God has placed internally not internal life internally and the reason why I want to I want to I want to deal with this because there are few verses down also I want for us to read but see where this would go with this talk God has placed there you have to remember that when when God made man he breathed into man and man became a living soul so that influence of God that makes us above the animals which is the breath of God the thing that drives our soul is is a sense of antenna it's a sense of internally now that every man has antenna life but every man has a soul and the soul is something that comes from God that's what makes us of higher intelligence than the animal that is the reason why make an event why why man and inventing is because he comes from a creator he can create but he can take what God has created and make something out of it he don't have to be a born-again Christian for him to invent something but it's in every man to be able to make something whether you take some some some some few leaves and make a food for you to eat I mean it's a sense of creation you have turned something from one state to another state praise the Lord so it's amen and where does that comes from it comes from the breath of God that's the thing that lasts in the soul of man okay let's go down a little bit here praise the Lord I'm throwing mine my bed out this morning and I think I'm getting a good catch amen praise the Lord amen let's look down in verse 18 let's look down in verse 18 verse 17 he says I said in my heart God shall judge the raptures and the wicked for there is a time there for every person in and for every work and I said in my heart concerning the state of the sons of men the sons of man see the way he said every man that is born of a woman is the sons of man I mean he says I'm speaking out about the state of the sons of man that God my manifest him and their them my see that they themselves are beasts did himself abyss for for that wish befalleth the the sons of man before abyss even one thing before of them as as the one thing before that no as one die so die the other yay they have all won birth so that a man have no preeminence above obese for all is vanity all go on to one place all of the dust in all return to the dust who knoweth the spirit of man that go upward nan that's where he's drawing the difference now because men have a soul so his spirit go up walk and the beasts go it down war are we together who know where the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the Beast that goeth downward to the earth so yes it a Solomon year is trying to make us to see it is that thing that God has played in the heart of man which of course bird brain MC is the small compartment where there is no blood he says that place is the soul and and and and God has placed there you know he pleased that in in the heart of man and and so every man has their you know every man has dead every man has has a soul and that's word God i occupy for the believer that's what we're going to talk about a little bit this morning as we would look into the Troon of mercy that is where God occupies for the believer when when the Spirit of God comes when the Holy Ghost comes the portion of God a portion of his antenna light it comes right into that place where blood does not occupy and that is the only thing that is different from between a man and a beasts that's what Solomon was saying here he realized that God has placed internally in a heart of man God has placed something in the heart of man too long after him because man was made in the image of God but beside that the same thing that we follow the Beast that's the same thing that we follow the man praise the Lord amen the Beast smell we also smell praise the Lord the same thing that we follow the Beast that's the same thing that we follow us you know so but why I'm drawing to this is because the the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost that's supposed to influence a man upward is now leaving man so if a man is left without the Spirit of God he's going to be nothing but a beast he's going to be nothing but a cruel beasts let's think for the word of God this morning I think I already got you on the hook so we can be able to go right now he may praise the Lord I learned some of the brothers but every day they got the brothers got him okay some of the brothers from from Iowa some of the young brothers they were coming to celebrate with us our first day in church and oh my goodness we just pray that God will be merciful on those men working for us praise the Lord so they are staying over and they might have a time of fellowship at my place playing music singing testifying this afternoon so you are all welcome praise the Lord so the the party continues [Laughter] praise Allah that's looking first Samir chapter 25 where we want to take our our reading from this morning for Samuel chapter 25 and some you died in all the Israelite would gather together to lammott him and bury him in the house of Rima and David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran and there was a man more rules possession wherein camels and the man was very great and [Music] he had three thousand ships and three thousand goats and he was sharing his sheep in camel now the name of of the man was never in the name of his wife Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding I will come back to that word good understanding and offer beautiful countenance but the man was challenged and evil in his doing and he was of the house of Caleb nowadays the beasts the Beauty and the beasts Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 I love this my steady Bible but I think I should get another one with a bigger print it will help me Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and on to the Angel of the Church of laude shall write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know that works but there I need a cold on half an hour and I oh there were cold or hot so them because there are lukewarm and neither cold on hat I would still be out of my mouth because they are seared I am rich in increasing goals they would describe never I'm puttin never as a type of the loudest church age how come the bride is found in this wicked age how count abigail was found with a man of such an evil heart that's what we want to talk about so and because they are serious I am rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing and knowing that that thou art wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked aiming let's pray together Heavenly Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we want to thank you father God we want to appreciate you Lord and we know the father there is a purpose to everything that you do and Lord God for you to bring the fullness of the bride to bring the opening of the seal the mystery of God reveal the marriage of the lamb in our age because we know we go into the matter to the wedding suffer the marriage of the lamb was conducted in this age and you place us in social age of a level of evil like the world had never seen father we we know you have a purpose and yellow we just want to submit our half this morning and our self to you that you will help us Lord the father God we will come to the realization why we are here why we are you we just prayed give us grace now in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen allah bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord praise the Lord so I think you see where we go in already so that's that's that's good that's good but we will we will go right back to the book of 1st Samuel chapter 25 there are a few things we want to pick up them now the Bible talks and describe Abigail Abigail means joy the joy of her father the joy of her father and you know I was I was thinking about it as I was studying the subject and I talked as he saw you know like someone said I heard someone saying this he said he says he said it like did she said when I find my wife he says I hit the jackpot [Laughter] praise the Lord and as we look at the character of Abigail that's what I was thinking as his never he hit the jackpot when he found his girl praise the Lord and and how many times but I think I think here you know it's a is you know is is it's a good statement in one sense I know we never supposed to be talking gambling your jackpot in one of you but [Laughter] firstly amen but you know I'm trying to bring it out in a way for us to be able to appreciate what God gave us the Bible says out of sedation you know you know God liking the gift of a wife or the husband you know - as much there is a lot of thing behind it because our our or our salvation is is is tied to it in one way or the other because Paul said in the book of efficient you know that a marriage is a mystery you know so the one that God would put in our life he going to use that person to be able to deal with some witnesses and he will use their person to be able to bring out some things that that even the pulpit will not be able to bring out praise the Lord so it's the mystery that is in marriage you know and I and I fear that is it's a fair statement you know you know you sometimes you you you I mean you see some couple uses oh my goodness I wonder how he got that wife I mean that that woman is saying but I think that I think there you know it is so good there I'm preaching the service hearing everybody's at home praise the Lord I know I will see eyes that will be crossing the cross and I will be distracted so but I think you know it is a fair statement and every woman should feel they are we in her heart and every man also should feel that way in his heart there whoever the law gave to them as they are made you know it was it was a blessing from the Lord you know but as as we look into into this gentleman's story we will realize there he never appreciated that blessing because the scripture right from the beginning right from the beginning introducing Abigail the Bible says she was a woman of an understanding heart and and and you will see that the scripture deals with that you know the scripture deals with the earth Solomon in a book of Proverbs there were three things that he line now and and the way he talks about them he talks about wisdom he talks about knowledge he talks about understanding and understanding comes right between wisdom and knowledge because wisdom is the right way to use knowledge and for the man or a woman to rightly use knowledge you have to have an understanding heart there are a lot of people that have great knowledge but they don't have wisdom they have great knowledge I mean the wise and and and poor in in Iran chapter 9 there was where he was kneeling the Jews he's in my bread rings he says my old bread is my own King Fox they have the knowledge of the law but never have wisdom to understand what God was doing in changing the disposition so understanding comes understanding holds the hands of wisdom and knowledge and then it makes all three of them a blessing so a man can have great knowledge but if you don't have wisdom he can even hang himself with all he knows are we together so the Bible speaks of Abigail here that she was a woman a daughter with an understanding heart an understanding heart and of a beautiful countenance praise the Lord so we're looking at though the Beauty and the Beast the beauty is too bright the farm herself in the house of neighbor our house of neighbor is loudest age reach in increase in goals and and and foolish praise the Lord so as we as we look at this there are a few things I want for us to look here let's go back to - to that chapter 25 and we will see some of the things you know that is described in the life of Abigail some of the things that play out in the life of Abigail that shows that she was a woman of an understanding hat I think we all know the story about it we know the story if you don't you can you can go back and read in but there is something I want to get to here praise the Lord let's look David Mann has axe the man of never on the field shielding their ships and everything and said well we have been here I mean we've been we've been watching over you people and you know protecting you P you know tell your master and when to tell him and you know and he was I mean he was he was very arrogant and all of that and and and those men came down the Bible says and the young man came down and it told Abigail that is him for his 14 I'm trying to skip a little bit here and verse 18 and Abigail make his after she have heard that and she took she took 200 loaves and two and bottles of wine and and five ships ready dress and five measure of posh calm and 500 you know raising and 200 kicks off a and she laid him on an ask and she got out there to meet David now verse 20 and it was so as she rolled on the ass that she came down by the cover of the hill and behold David and his men came down against her and she met she met him now David has said surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow had in the witness so that nothing was missed in all that petty neuron to him and he had reward a mean evil for good so and more also do God on to the enemies of David if I live if I live of all the petty known to him by the morning light ended that peace that he gave the wall and when Abigail saw David she hasted and in light of all the eyes she fell before David on her face and bow herself to the ground and fell at his feet and said unto him my lord upon me let this iniquity be praised alone and left donghae me I pray thee speak in an audience and hear the words all done him me let met my lord I pray thee regard this man of a b-line even regard even noble for us his name is Sol Sol is he never is his name and fall it is with him there was something I want to get to you but I didn't hear me saw not a young man of my Lord whom they are saying now therefore my lord asked the Lord living and as thy soul liveth seeing the Lord have withholding thee from from coming to sheer blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hands now let thine enemy and they that seek evil to my lord be as never now and now the blessing wish that him may has brought unto my lord let it be given to the young man that follow my law now this is what I want to get you now I pray thee I pray thee now watch this now I pray thee forgive the trespass of the hemming for the Lord will surely make my lord a sure house now thou wert a sure house now here is Abigail the one thing there that is that is there is that Abigail she's playing out an intercession ministry she's interceding and she's she she she does herself in the gap realizing that what she has heard judgment is coming to her house blood is going to run down the living room the bedroom wherever nel but is going to be sleeping and David said every man that pitted against the wall all the male were going to be slaughtered now she had not heard what they were saying she had not heard but Naurang the foolishness of her husband is going to cause the death of the house and she know that if she don't do nothing about it in my evening calls for light because no I mean nobody would know who is the wife who is the seven those men comes I mean they're there they're giving order and they would just go through the house praise the Lord so she's taking a ministry to intercede and because she's burning with this thing now washing see was going to happy because she's burning she comes and she threw herself down the Bible says greater love love no man than for the man to lay down his life I'm talking about the bride now so keep keep the bride that's our position that's the reason why we are in this age and all of these things are happening around us they evil the politics the wickedness of the house of the people the rejection of the Word of God and all of these things now if those things are given us a wrong attitude then we have to check ourselves we are missing our position because I call into the scripture when seen about grace much more abound so grace is on the people of God say it's on the people of God as the word increase in unrighteousness and wickedness oh mercy should flow from our heart we should drive down our car with tears coming from our eyes and saying God have mercy how can a young man run around the street like this how can a young woman go down though how can she live Allah have mercy are we together and have the intra-syrian not a heart that criticized because we think I mean we have we have made a rapture you better wait until you get in the rapture find yourself on the other side before you start to praise and boast about the rapture not now many men has confessed this rapture and dance in it and yet instead they have gone far away from the grace of this truth praise the Lord she threw herself down before dev a flat to the floor you have to remember this woman is an honourable woman she said respect a woman because her husband is a wealthy man she did not care about how much her robbed Club cost praise the Lord I mean she didn't care how much it costs she true or self flat to the floor praise the Lord I've seen those things you know when people want to make scene you know and and or they're already pre plain in your mind are they going to be humble so they look for you know the clothes they all clothes they wear it because they have pre plain in your mind you're going to be humbled today I'm you're going to throw myself down that because this clothes does not cost me anything in a way but I mean when when the Spirit of God takes the heart of a man or a woman just like dimming in the returning of the Ark of the Covenant never even consider that he was a king all the costs of the Rob that he was wearing he put himself before the Lord amen and I think that's some other thing that have affected the church and people cannot even get down on your knees and leave their hands because they can't so much the cost of the applause they just bought it on Saturday for the service on Sunday so it's too expensive for them to to roll to order to become a Holy Roller amen glory be to God when the church starts becoming more conscious of God and more conscious of what is upon the word what is coming upon the world more conscious of the time that we are living in and start losing consciousness of our self our pride in our arrogance thing I mean people will weep they will weep I don't even care if your tears is falling on the maybe $300 suit or whatever he calls you I also thank God I'm not going to tell you to my secret places let me go right into this message praise the Lord in in in so she threw herself right down before David and because she was caught with the truth nests of heart she was really interceding she broke into prophecy not even roaring that's what I want for us to travel a little bit listen today she says I pray thee forgive the trespass of the hemming now she was not the one that a man came to praise the Lord she was not the one that the man came to they got a message they went straight over to neighbor and he told him indeed I mean he got with David it's another breakaway so do the assault is looking for you're talking from a sheep calling and he sat when I read the whole life of David and people they do those things today as soon as I stop falling away from the Word of God or falling away from the message that's when they you know they the nobler Branham father's life story they didn't know you know where he was born or in all sorts of things but I'm not going there this morning I'm staying right here she said forgive the trespass of the Jemez for the Lord will certainly make my lord a shore house thou word a shore house it's a prophecy that word a shore house is a prophecy and that's why we're going to study it a little bit a shore house the first time it was used let's go back to you first time here chapter 2 when God has rejected Eli now that word that that phrase the shore house is speaking about the house of mercy that was the house dablam bottommost saw when he says how much it'll mean there are sort of Devi oh my goodness I'm beginning to feel so good I feel like I can run through a war amen if I get through that war I hope you follow me pretty oh my goodness first time your chapter 2 I just you know I just the reason what I just love the Word of God I just love the Word of God because God has a way that he sees things you know he sees it he locks it in the Covenant you have to get in that covenant before you understand it oh my first time your chapter 2 let's travel back a little bit yeah oh I'm feeling so good amen amen first summit chapter 2 now Eli was very old oh I'm going to five-year okay God is now speaking to Eli here verse 27 and there came a man of God on to Eli okay so this man of God is now telling you know all of the things that is going to come upon his house and and and what will follow as as you know dad just read that and you know steady dating and you see the Lord speaking to you verse that one behold that they commit that I will cut off that arm and the arm of your father house you know and we saw the death of Eli you know his his arm was not literally cut off so this is not speaking about cutting off his his literal arm but cutting him off cut in his house who which mean his sons will not continue in the priesthood because God was going to establish a new order amen so if your left hand or fan you cut it off don't go and use knife please and I shall see the enemy thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which the law should I give Israel and there shall not be an old man in the house forever and we go in go in alone here hope ok yeah I think I'm right the scripture says and okay let's look at verse 35 that's what I want to get to and I will rise up a faithful priest I will rise up a faithful priest now Samuel was not a priest Samuel was a seal are we together samuel was not a priest samuel was a seal oh man this thing is becoming so good but here the man of God is telling Eli I'm going to raise up a faithful priests - I do a calling to that which is in my heart a man after God's own heart I'm going to raise up a faithful priests they will do what is in my heart and my mind and I will build him a show house praise the Lord and he shall work before mine anointed for ever that's the house of David that's the Millennial Kingdom that's the house of David that is the millennial promise God saying it's telling even I would I would cut off your arm there is not a one from from from from from you your father house is going to go along in a priesthood but I will raise up one he's going to be a faithful priest unto me he's gonna be a man after my heart and man I will know that we'll be able to grab the touch of my mine and I'm establishing a priesthood with him forever glory be to God I would give him a shore house now here is Abigail yeah caught up in a ministry of intercession and she truer said before David the spirit of the law comes upon her and she's prophesying the same thing that the man of God says spoke about David even before David came to power because because she find herself at the right place the right time with the right attitude praise the Lord oh I believe she has seen the foolishness of neighbor over and over Chico I said children your father have done the worst one David the man I can't believe yes pack our things and leave this house Junior where's your shoes let's go because I'm not dev and his men they don't taik nonsense from nobody is that why your father she would just Pat the children let me go back to my father's house but she never did that her husband never even knew about it she never went and make a council with him what have you done again and did she know that foolishness was in his heart quickly Sheik she killed some lawmen and make some cakes and and and got her some wine and and all of those things oh my goodness praise the Lord just like those wise men coming to worship we have seen the king and we have come to worship Him praise the Lord amen we don't come when we come to worship we come to give as as we come to receive we give our all we give our praise we I mean we come to pour ourself so she was coming ready ready to appease Devi she find herself the right place at the right time with the right attitude so God had to give her the right words to say oh I just loved it my goodness I just loved it maybe that's the reason why we're not back in our church yet you mean praise the Lord I just love that Amen God give her the right word to say she said I know I prayed it I know the Lord will give you a sure house praise the Lord amen so actually as we traveled alone a little bit we will see what this show House is because that's what we want to dwell on this morning the show house of David over over the ages it was it was not called a show house again in first Kings chapter 11 God - vs. name now rehab Rome that was not the son of David the son of Solomon the the captain it was really Brahm and what is the guy named that's that took the ten kingdoms jerem yes children children when when when when he when he talked and and and and and and and the kingdom was splitted God told him that if you will work like my seven David Walker I will give you a shore house but the Bible says he did not work so we will find out what this shore house is but when if you travel through the scripture every time like the prophet Isaiah he tried to refer back to death to their promise of David over the years it became the show mercy of David so it was not a literal house it was little called the show mercy of David as I chapter 55 that's right and then you will realize also that's show mercy of David oh my goodness this scene is going to become so sweet it became a promise to the Gentiles that's what Paul you and myself in the show mercy of David they rewrote our lives it took us from from from from the dungeon of scene it took us from idolatry and brought us right into the cavity of David that was the house a shore house it was net this this show house of David this show mercy of David goes to the Millennium it goes to the Millennium right in the melon air we will still be under the mercy and the grace of God oh praise Oh seiyya 55 let's look at a little bit the profit as I had spoke about it and then I was sure we would look at something again how it came over to the Gentile Church as I had chapter 55 praise the Lord Isaiah chapter 55 that's where the Prophet as I cry out with our money with our price and everlasting coveting mine when brother Branham preached a message gold rich in mercy oh my goodness I don't want to go ahead of myself this morning but we would get there we see how how the show house of David the show mercy of David came to you and myself as a god that is rich in mercy Oh everyone that tests come here to the waters and he to have no money come here by eat yeah come buy wine and milk without money and without price amen Wuerffel do you spend money for that which is not bread in your labor for that which satisfy net ache intelligently unto me in it that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness incline your years and come on to me hear and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you even the show mercy of David so this come and with our money with our we know that that was it was all of their Jesus said he deliver and has heavy leading he come on to me because he was the fulfillment of Isaiah 55 so through the cross through cavalry now we are introduced to the show house of David which is the show mercy of David oh my oh my goodness me praise the Lord as chapter thirteen glory be to God announced chapter 13 and announced chapter 13 the senior is the other praise the Lord we see here the the bread wins here over in Acts chapter 13 we realize there was a place I'm trying to try to get myself to get it a little bit here now so we see the Apostle Paul year over in this chapter and he comes and he meet these people here he's going to tell them about God's mercy he's going to tell them about a new copy and the very thing that he fought against to stop and kill those a posture and the scripture says as Paul starts to speak to these people and he starts to tell them about David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart we shall fulfill all my will now he goes back that is in verse 22 he goes back to 1st Samuel chapter 2 the very same thing that man of God said to Eli I will raise up a priest because we have to understand in David's ministry he fulfilled the prophet priest and King the scriptures say he professor with the prophets and being a priest he had a right to eat the Shabri and he was a king so David in his ministry he fulfilled the Prophet precinct king so when when that man of God was prophesying to to Eli he was not talking Samuel you know Samuel came as a seal Samuel was was was normal among the major prophets so we realized here so yeah so here's a poor year now and man they have studied the Old Testament and seeing what God is doing they're opening his eyes to the revelation of the hour he's speaking here to to these people talking about Jesus and when he had removed him he's gonna gone all the way back remove him he raised up unto them David to be king to whom also he have given a testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse but you see there over in in first Kings chapter 2 David name was not mentioned but because it was fulfilled in David's life now year poor Commission David's name because it's a man that fulfilled that prophecy but when the man of God gave the prophecy he never said David he said I will raise up a man a faithful priest a man after my heart and we know my mind but poor seeing that the scripture has been fulfilled so he can put David name in that place praise the Lord it's just like when we said Malachi 4 when we say Malachi 4 we around the message we know we're talking about brother Branham why because we we have seen that ministry being fulfilled in his ministry there are promise that prophecy before I send you Elijah the prophet are we together so as he goes along here verse 26 men and brethren children of the stock of Abraham whosoever among you their fear of God to you is the word of this salvation praise the Lord and he goes on and he talks and he talks and he come over a year to verse 32 and we declare unto you glad tidings how dare the promise which was made unto the father's God have fulfilled the sin unto us their children in that he raised up Jesus again as it is also written in the second Psalm there are my son this day have I begotten thee and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wine we give you the show mercy of David wherefore he said also in another Sam there there shall not suffer the Holy One to see corruption praise the Lord there he talks about what David was dead David the one I said that but he was there but because it was speaking about Christ it was tied to the resurrection so you see through the resurrection of Jesus Christ we have been introduced to the show mercy love David that's the reason why Paul said if he said if only in this life here we are of all men miserable there was no resurrection we will surely be of all memorable because there is there is a lot of benefit that comes through the resurrection of Jesus Christ to talk to the New Testament church now so we see here that this promise that God gave spoke about David a show house of David which is the show mercy of David we see how it has been playing but this is where I want to out you know I'm trying to just talk him out of these things but I'm getting to that place how Abigail I don't believe she was in the house of Eli when that man of God said it but honor inspiration because she find herself in the right ministry at the right time she was not a preacher because the law of God condemns that praise the Lord but she had a hot she had a heart to be able to present herself before God that God would give her the right words the right thing to say at the right time a woman of understanding heart a woman of understanding heart is a woman whose heart is full of mercy and her that is for of vengeance can never be an understanding heart praise the Lord one time David was caught in his own guilt and it was troubling him about the death of urias and when Nathan came in his house he was so nervous until he said the man that have done that he must die why because he was caught up in guilt he knew that he had done something wrapped Josh Mae was all running through his mind so when the heart is filled with judgment criticizing and and I mean yes you just I mean I mean you can never have an understanding heart you can even see it things so your own hurt you can see it things to your own hurt same things so your children on their own hurt no matter how how backsliding a child aged a mother has more always cried for mercy and say God have mercy on my boy the son of my breasts have mercy that's an understanding heart not caught up in rage and you can't forgive in your job bitter and in order that you can never find mercy before God that's the bright position I mean we this age have so much pressure there is just so much pressure or that the weaken a gentle spirit that is in the atmosphere now you yourself sometimes you you make yourself angry praise the Lord you just get so angry why you can't get up from bed you alone on the bed nobody has talked to you just like what you can't wake up I mean just so much pressure on this age if we don't find an understanding heart before the Lord we will see things to our own hurt out of ignorance out of thick knowledge and things that we know the man of God we know the message of we will say things to our own hurt and that's that's a problem sometimes people say things and you realized that is to their own hurt and they're not humble enough to retrieve those things back and see God have mercy didn't knew that he said what he said it was to his own hurt the man that have done that that man should die they don't say you are the man David I believe the King fell down from his strong fear to the feet of the Prophet because he knew that he have uses all mouth to destroy his house but she was a woman of honesty Nihad she said have mercy on your handmaid Oh David I wish I was I wish I was the one that you're me that your boys met how much it'll mean she took the blame for what she never did that's the show Mercer of David praise the Lord oh man praise the Lord my goodness sometimes it's good to go to bed tired when you go to bed tired I'm a your spirit just feels so free and then I mean I was just lying that God you have to help me girl you have to help me my goodness she find herself to the right place that's the bright position that's the bright place in this evil hour just a bright place the bride and the Spirit see come that's what the scripture says but you see with all of these things that is going on you know God we have to bring this bride through everything that his were saying there was no shocker for the bride you know everybody looking at you know looking at this epidemic to put us in the rapture if he put us in a rapture rapture we would go amen but if met this bride will go through this and shew again character she would get a heart before the Lord he had to put us to places that he humbled us she had an understanding hand and she said God have mercy on you hear me I wish I was the one your boys man I'm just taking care of the kids maybe she went to the market to go and buy food for never I was going to have his feast bring his friend over drink wine and just insult just that our she missed an opportunity of seeing us man and she realized she realized that death was approaching her house she got on everything quickly praise the Lord a scripture sees when a man or a woman pauses dead who's made is an unbeliever when a Bible talks about being warned by the conversation verbatim say is their behavior it comes right here in the life of Abigail it comes right here that that believer you have to realize what it is the man or the woman you youup list you you have an opportunity you have an opportunity to be a talking to that home because you know grace has come to you grace has come to you you know what the word says so you have an opportunity to be as a mercy I mean the show mercy to that home that's what Paul says there he says he says their spouse will be will be waned by their conversation it's no it's not you're picking up the Bible and says no the Bible says this the banknote is your behavior your attitude the way you love your wife and you stay respect the Word of God the way you love your husband and you stayed I mean I keep the commandment of the Lord just just in simplicity in simplicity you love your wife you love your husband you love your children and you just be a sweet humble Christie and by that acted to you by that attitude holding mercy in your heart not getting angry well yeah yeah yeah because you don't read the Bible because you don't know no you were just completely out of order you yourself you need a comforter to rebuff toss you keep you under water a little bit praise the Lord I would together I think you grab me what I'm going okay that's another thing here in the life of a beginner I want for us to pick up I get talking and I leave the thing I'm supposed to be preaching there's two two different things it's supposed to be preaching and not talking I hope you know when I'm talking okay I'm just talking Amy I want you to be listening to me when I'm preaching now when I'm talking praise low let's take Abigail right here again the scripture says here she came and she spoke did the Bible says verse 29 here Abigail state speaking yet a man is raising to pursue him and to seek thy soul but but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life verbatim verbal use this statement in marriage and their vows when he's talked when he spoke about Abigail and and it's another prophecy I mean this woman that's the reason why the Ministry of intercession is the greatest ministry it is the greatest ministry it's the greatest ministry the Ministry of intercession is the success to every other ministry a man can be a preacher if he does not have people that are interceding and praying he can never be a benefit sometimes you look at the preacher and you think is the preacher no it's the people that are praying the people that are saying God you know speak to us speak through him the ministry of intercession is the greatest ministry that's why when a person find himself to that place and God hears this is prophesying she says a man has risen up to seek your life he says but the Lord God of our Father will wrap you up in a bundle of life the bundle of love but Bram used that immersion that was when he when he spoke of Abigail the bundle of life with the law that God and I saw and the soul of an enemy and them shall be slain out as out of the middle of the slain oh my goodness me my middle of the slain what she's talking about when you went the same way you swing and that stone left the middle of the slain and and God saw so also the Lord that took that stone to the head of Goliath he will also take take off the head of those that seek your life and it shall come to pass when my lord sha shall have done all when the Lord when the Lord shall have done so my lord I call into all the goodness that he has spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel that this shall be no grief unto thee no no faint of heart unto my lord now she'sshe's the Intercity when you when you have taken the truth that you will not remember the evil that have come from out of my house because I know for sure you're going to be king over Israel my goodness barb Adam says that is the thing that is the thing he says he says the coming of the Lord rejoice our heart you know that's the thing that makes us to press on that I mean to hold on and in it because we know that surely he's going to come as king of kings and Lord of lords whether whatever we we meet him in this life oh whether we go down by the where of the grave we know surely he's coming to power she knew he was coming to power now you and I remember this thing they have come from out of my house that this shall be no grief on today none of things of heart on to my lord either that they'll have shared blood costlessly or that my lord hath avenged himself but when the law shall have their well with my lord then remember the Hemi amen and David said unto me Gill blessed be the Lord God of Israel we send thee this day to meet me what a comfort what a comfort all the rage that has risen up in David's heart may we spin out at night here boys is that real what he said are you sure that what he said my goodness okay okay I think he was drunk I would take that wine from his eyes uh-oh the anger when he saw how that woman threw herself down and start to cry it took all of that away it took all the anger away Davis appreciating you coming right at the right time just at the right time there was no better time for Esther to go in the presence of the king because Hema have just he have just loaded the gallop ready to Hank Molokai on it Eva if Esther will have waste time her uncle was going to be killed and then the blood of the Jews was going to be wasted in the city so she came in the right time if I would die let me die administrating of intercession that is the brightest ministry that is a bright ministry that's what barber said in in revelation series chapter 4 when he talks about the Troon being in the heart that's what we come into when he talks about the truth being in the heart that's what the bright ministry is it's a Ministry of intercession Ezekiel the angel went down the city sealing doors that were weeping why intercession they were interceding for the evil that is done in a city that is the bride ministry that is the beauty of the bride in the house of the beasts because she has an understanding heart she has been told about the things in politics she has been told about the things in in prophecy so she has an understanding heart you couldn't bring the first age that the efficient bride in this age they then I had the fullness of the world you couldn't even bring the the bride I was under the Ox ministry you couldn't bring them in it's a because people they were anointed I mean to give them self to be killed so they had a way of challenging Authority understand before I told you to challenge the authority because I mean they were glad to dine but this bride is to excel above them all to the very heart of God and what is the heart of God seeking mercy it's seeking mercy there are son of David have mercy on me there is never a time and may ask for mercy that God ever turned his head that is a show house of Divi no matter how evil a man can be when that teeth on the cross they remember me remember me there is never a time a man asks for mercy if you don't know how to pray just say God have mercy on me [Laughter] Corey praise the Lord that's why keeping you going brother scared me yeah bad mercy is a very heart of God the show mercy of David that's the beauty of the bride the beauty of the bride is not in the healing revival that's what the care master church and Pentecost they all running for it everybody trying to make signs that they are trying they are hiring people and paying them just to discern the beauty of the bride is not in that the beauty of the bride is not in the knowledge of the word it's not how much you know the beauty of the bride is how much your heart is able to cry before God and say have mercy that's the beauty of the bride that is the beauty of the bride that's a tender branch in that day the beauty of the brine the branch of the bride would be beautiful that's the thing that gets to the heart of God there's a man and a woman they say God have mercy on us God have mercy on this age have mercy on our house have mercy on our nation have mercy on the people a mercy on our city God have mercy [Music] praise the Lord amen there is a bless the Lord God of Israel who have seen you this day and blessed be thy advice and blessed be down deviously I've heard all you say I surrender I surrender after all you say let's be the out-of-hours blessed be thou we shall kept me this day from coming to shear blood and from avenging myself with my own hands for him very deed as the Lord God of Israel living we have kept me back from hurting the set down as he stood and come to meet me surely there have now been one left on to neighbor by the morning praise the Lord there was something verse 30 says something Abigail said in Abigail came to never know that's that's not what I want to get you just read a little okay after after the Lord I mean she came to never from there and she told her husband all that half happy and he got a stroke immediately he got a stroke the reality hit him you know he got a stroke from realizing the wrong he realizing what he was bringing on himself and he died but after never die this is what I want to get you to now David sent for send his men to go and get Abigail to be his wife it was it was out of place were David you know it was just like when Judah Tamar has married he sounds he passed to the next son he pass and and the owner's son he ha was still a young boy I call into the trap of Israel unless the diary was returned she was returned back to her father's house she was stayed a wife to the family so and and and she wanted to be part of this blessing because I believe being with the different brothers she heard about the blessing the coveting of Abraham and so the Bible says she Playa Hallett by these guys in herself because she wanted to take in a seed of Abraham that's what Paul used that when he said in childbearing she shall be safe Paul was referring back to an Old Testament type it is not in it's not a New Testament for physical fulfillment the reason is because the New Testament church is going to take in a spiritual sea which is the incorruptible seed the Word of God so but she disguise herself and then after they told Judah your daughter-in-law is pregnant he says my goodness she played the harlot y'all bring her here we gonna stone that woman to death and and in all of that and she brought out the treasure she said by the man to have this he says something he said Tara thou are righteous then I the reason why he said that is because he realized that she uh she she caught a revelation she wanted to be identified in the coveting it is not just because I mean she just wanted to be a harlot because you have to realize I calling to the scripture she you need these guys herself for her father-in-law she was not just out there for every man I was passing by it's because she wanted to come honor that coveting she wanted to come honor that protection because you know if she was not only that protection she was vulnerable praise the Lord so that it is it is the same thing year with David and Abby Gil Dimmie has realized and woman was such a character that here is him back from sharing blocked a woman with an honest any heart when he heard what has happened to never he said Wow my goodness I think I would just trust the law to fight my battle I mean because he was not wound up going for now but he says everything that passes against which me every male in the house so he was attracted to the character but this is this is what I want to I want to get us now the scripture says he said and after Abigail came verse 41 the Bible says she arose and by herself on her face to the earth and said behold ahem may be there 7 to wash the feet of the seventh of my Lord to wash the feet of the seventh of my lord that's what I wanted to grab here this morning kind of applause last week we were talking about speaking a little bit on a message doing God a service doing God a service what doing God a service is it's when we wash one another feet that's the reason why Jesus took it in their little tie before he left his church and he says what I do on to you now you don't know none that nothing about it but you know year after you call me Lord and Master I wash your feet don't wash my do one onto another because that is that is a secret like I said last week that is the secret that is that that is in this coveting we are core to self watching watching feet was the highest symbol of being a seven it was the highest symbol why because verbatim said it was the least job it was the least job so she she's not coming and says well you know I'm from a rich man house so I want to be the hair wife no the Bible says she by her head machine come on she said I'm not even wanted to be your wife I just want to wash the feet of the servants of my lord I want to be a service to my king not just beep riding and dress-up and twisting in the Polish no she wanted to be see oh my goodness me there are things they are things that God like brother branham said Christ is the minister of God revealed he said they are things that God put in the Old Testament characters they are mistress that he put any characters of their lives they were living their lives but yet they were playing out the mixture of God the thing from the very heart of God and that is one of our problems the greater move of God they have a struck the earth God greater than Solomon being displayed before us the mystery of God and all of these things they had just make a bunch of so proud and arrogant and when it's like that is just all knowledge it had not dropped in your heart because when this word drop in your heart it has so much weight it will put you on your knees when the word drops in your heart then Almighty God he cannot drop in your heart and use this thing when God drop in your heart you would get on your knees this message caught a bride to make her s72 this word it was a Ministry of intercession with a Ministry of intercession we Accord to be seventh I mean that's the reason why we can fuss that's a reason why I mean we can destroy one another that's the reason why I mean we can run from pillar to post that's the reason why we can do everything that we don't because it's just all up here God drop in your heart you will fall on your knees that's the position of the bride in this age the beauty in the house of the beasts the beauty that she has is to be able to Humble herself before the word is to be able to have a heart and look for one to self praise the Lord that was what David saw that was the thing that David was attracted to that's the thing that he was attracted to to see a woman standing in a gap keeping his hands from sharing blood see the beauty of this read the next chapter chapter 26 David is Saul is now exposed to David soul is now exposed to David and David can kill him David had a right to kill him but Davey has just been exposed to a prophecy that he did not know was hanging over him the show mercy of David he's a fire beard then I put my hands on the Lord's anointed he had just been exposed to a prophecy that he did not know was hanging over his head let me read some few things here before because I can go like this then if you don't stop me it's all night prayer meeting Amy because when I leave from me I'm just going to crash gonna be the god he mean problem says this he said he said relationship to fall is his yeah he says now he says now is the day of mercy now let's go back to the Old Testament years just a little bit and find out what mercy is go on back and see what happened on this truth destroy the throne of judgment the reason today that there is mercy is because the mercy seat is sprinker wave and a to me blood as he says and as long as blood is on the the mercy seat then it is net Josh Mahnomen it's mercy because something died - still Josh mean something died - still judgment and that's what that's what I be guilty she died to her prime she died to her beauty to hold judgment to halt the wrath of God from her house something died to steal judgment you see it amen he says as long as blood is on the mercy seat it shows there something died to hold judgment back but when the churches rapture the mercy seat becomes a judgment seat amen he said the church in his condition now this is direct directed by the Holy Ghost you are forgiving and have no enemies living pass above the condemnation of sinners you don't live like the headings you live different your your life is its part and different the gentle Holies very sitting on the throne of your heart making you live peaceful and quiet and loving around all people your neighbors in all he sees in and in all your associate knows that you are a gentle quiet meek humble Christian the door of God is with you praise the Lord the infallibility of the proof of of the resurrection he says the same that the same question said to when the Holy Spirit comes into the hema heart the same question is settled praise the Lord when that is the reason why the Holy Ghost bring us an understanding heart Norbert Branham said he says when he when he talks on Paul prophecy when Paul said now we know in part when that wish is perfect will come well he said that which is perfect is the perfect understanding that that wish is perfect the perfect understanding for us to rightly apply the word that's God's perfection perfect understanding and that's what Abigail had perfect understanding that wish is perfect when they shall come that wishes in part will be done away with praise the Lord perfect understanding you know when when the Holy Ghost comes into the human hand is set to the same question why I mean it helps us to understand what God is doing in our lives you know when things is repeating in our lives it's not a way to condemn our sin and well I think I need to be rebaptised again well I think I need to go to the altar to pray for the Holy Ghost again it's because God is waving something before you he's trying to get your attention he's trying to teach you perfect understanding we are not blindly shooting God is teaching us he's dealing with our hearts he's teaching us we can be able to see things in our lives and he put those things there for the reason he's teaching every one of us he says it casts down reasoning it cast down reasoning when the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart it goes above our intellectual effect not as splitting away everything when a person can explain away everything has a reason for everything and every little thing they tried to make a spiritual so they can build himself out they quickly get to their phone and find a few coats where brother branham said this and that and it in here they see two coats where he says this and they never ready 20 of where he speaks against that it goes beyond intellectual faith when the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart now today the reason so many ups and downs and teens enter the religious people because there's an intellectual conception we have in so much knowledge we need an honest any heart to apply wisdom to our knowledge we're having so much knowledge that's what this world has brought us we have to be grateful we have to be grateful you don't find those languages in other groups on an important is just a technology I mean technology in a message on importance is a demonstration where bamse went to unimportant meets he says the Murray clears manifest said it's a demonstration in other groups is just a terminology he's an unimportant God he's an only seeing God but but by the message of the our brother banner has brought us an understanding what it is he says he's an only present God because he's on his hands he's everywhere because he knows everything so we have all of those we have those information but we need to apply our heart to wisdom that's the place that we are missing it you know what Paul says he says our wisdom is Jesus Christ praise the Lord that's what he said our wisdom is Jesus Christ let me finish reading I will show that to you in the scripture he says and today the reason so many ups and downs and things I enter the religious people because there is an intellectual conception of cry in other words it is India mind and not the heart they just mentally believe it they can call it

Luke chapter two talking about the growth of Jesus how he grew in stature before man and before God so what is Paul saying here he's saying that even the Bible say he learned obedience the many things he suffered so wisdom was hid in his life even from growing up the life of Jesus wisdom was hid in it it's a will for us it's may wisdom that we can grow in stature before men and before God we can learn in obedience by the many things that we suffer those were the things that were hidden in Jesus life Almighty God learning obedience why because he was wisdom wisdom learned let's bow our heads
