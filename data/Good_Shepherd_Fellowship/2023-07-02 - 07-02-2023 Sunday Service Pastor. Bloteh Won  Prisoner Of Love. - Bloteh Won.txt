s I see Glory War in this world [Music] praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you thank you Physicians you can have your seat let's take our Bibles who turn to the book of phaliman and [Music] that looks like the drama is not done with the songs here he's making the he's playing there the last attention be amen well it's good it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning praise the Lord amen we want to ask God's special blessing upon the service praise the Lord and uh I told Brother Jordan now the word around this I'm actually taking this inspiration from brother Brown message Paul a praising her that's that's what I'm taking the inspiration from and we will preach speak on a prisoner of love but then we will come back to uh that's after the book of Titus praise the Lord foreign preached his message on a Wednesday night it was a Wednesday night he preached his message and their very night he baptized the great scholar brother leeville in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so let's read verse 1. Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ in Trinity our brother onto phaliman our dear beloved and fellow laborer praise the Lord let's pray together father we want to thank you Lord for another time oh god of Fellowship and Lord Jesus we know that Lord God this is a letter that was intended to be a private letter but it was also a benefit to the the Saints in collusion those days and also it's a benefit unto us in precious Lord we pray father Lord in no sense to god father to impersonate Lord God or imitate yourself on the prophet but Lord we want to stay under the inspiration of the holy spirit this morning the Lord we can be able to take a portion that will be a blessing to us Lord father because Lord God will be an instructed Lord father to say what the messengers say it is not just literally father just reading every line of God but being under the Same Spirit that's what he said in the church age book lord it will have to take the Holy Ghost to keep us under there same anointing for us to say what the messengers say now for us to be like a parrot Lord oh god father but Lord Jesus for us to be a echo of the voice of God so we pray this morning that you will come and take our inability and father Lord take our insufficientness Lord God May Lord in the entire congregation this morning we commit ourselves to you pray father Lord that you will just help us this morning as we want to enter into this subject Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen now as we as we uh begin this month of July uh yeah but Johnny have a birthday happy birthday brother Johnny and and all of you that uh having a July birthday or the July birth happy birthday and all of you that have your birthday in the last part of June happy birthday also praise the lord we don't want to we'll want to cover everybody amen we want to make sure that everybody is covered praise the Lord while I was studying on this I saw this ad someone wrote this ad they said help wanted so after reading the essays yeah this is a good ad I think I can use it in church because I need help amen it's good when you can get to the place and realize that you need help so uh uh I told us as well I think it's a good thing I think I can use it so uh they said men and women want it for difficult tax of building a church men and women wanted for difficult tasks of building the church you will often be misunderstood even by those working with you you will face constant attack from an invisible enemy you may not see the result of your labor and your full reward will not come until after all your work is completed it may cost your home your family your ambition even your life who's all in this morning praise the Lord amen I don't know whether you understand the term of the job you are signing up for praise the Lord amen praise the Lord but I I I was being studying this uh uh message for the wine and uh I took this portion that's supposed to be the end it's supposed to be the end brother Brown actually brought this out at the end and uh at the end he said oh finally God had a man that was subject to him highness to him and could not move until the word of God move him if people who do a people who just do that then he was his prisoner a prisoner of love yoke up in the bound of love with God as Paul was yoked up in the bound of Love With God just like Paul so that's what we're taking our inspiration from this morning a prisoner of love but uh might go in a completely different direction this morning as but we have we have a whole month or the rest of the year to be able to exhaust everything that was taught to you praise the Lord he says now I can imagine Paul when he wrote this letter Philemon how he was sitting in jail down there in the dungeon of this city in Praise I mean a prisoner and he could well know by his position what the word meant he was surrounded by bars he could only be let free as someone who let him go free and he knew what it was to be a prisoner and then again I believe the Apostle men just a little not exactly addressing it to his present condition as being a prisoner in his physical being sitting there sitting here in the jail in this jail but I believe he was referring to his being his Spirit his will being a prisoner to Jesus Christ praise the Lord so that's that's what we want to look at uh this morning that's what we want to we want to study this morning I have a little picture there that I that I took off and uh of Paul in in praising writing his letters this morning we all sit here well dressing coming to the house of the Lord to to Worship the Lord in and true bring praise sing Psalms and and praises to the Lord and yet that's that's you know that's wonderful there's uh but there are some that I gather you know in other places in hitting places they are worshiping and uh the the Christians in the in the in the Emirates the Arab Republic they can't gather on Sunday because it will be against the national law they have to gather on Friday because it's the Islamic worship day and so they don't have the privilege to meet even though some of them do meet but they have to do it in secret or as they could be arrested and persecuted for it and there are some that are having the Sunday service this morning in praising and whether you are in a suit like me oh in your best dress for Sunday today as we go into this I will want you to realize uh establish I want to establish the fact that God has designed it is God's Own design praise the Lord as much as we think we are in a free country you have your cars parking out there amen and you can get up anytime and join it and go and of course we wouldn't like you to do that right now and just bear with us a little bit amen but what I want us to realize is that there is there's a great design of God there is there is something the more you look into this you know as I was as I was setting last night actually it was this morning that the whole thought started breaking to me and I realized that I'm beginning to look at the subject completely different why let me ask this question because if you look in the in the Bible you realize that most of God's people Joseph had to go to praising praise the Lord even our lord Jesus have to go to praising you will find out because as I was thinking about it this morning I caught myself between the Rock and the high place because here we have a society we are living in a society that uh setting words and and approach to certain subject has been misunderstood praise the Lord but if you take this Bible this is the word of God we believe that this is the word of God this is the Breath of God this book is sacred if you take this Bible you'll realize that one of the big history in the scripture the very foundation of the church is surrounding the life of a people that were in praising that were people that were enslaved praise the Lord amen yeah in our present word that we are living in there's a complete different context of slavery and I want to pray slavery to you this morning I don't I don't know much about it but I want for us to grab our mind because you have to realize what I want us to realize is that foreign everything that God allowed he has a fountain of Rich thoughts behind it sometimes we get stumble by the surface Jeremiah says and he says speaking God's thought I know the thought that I think towards you the another thoughts of evil praise the Lord amen they are not the thoughts of evil but Joseph being the young boy Joseph was just a teenager when he was sold to the Ishmael Knights and taking over to Egypt he miss all his youthfulness praise the Lord amen Joseph there is no way that Joseph who has sat there being so to those men completely stranger he's in the chair taken away to a place where he don't know where there is no way that he could sit there and think that this was for good there is no way that Joseph could sit in that Terror he said he is for God I believe he cried because he won't see his little brother Benjamin he won't see his father that love him and he won't see his brother he cannot even tell why his brother would do this to him praise the Lord but for many years after they are very Saint Joseph who said you meant this for evil but God made praise the Lord man we thank God for the prophet that took us back to the mind of God praise the Lord if you are still stuck on the pages you are missing a whole lot go beyond the pages and let's go back to the mind of God brother Branham question and answer in Genesis he said let's stand on the bannister of Heaven and let's go back to the mind of God and see before there was a word when God was alone praise the Lord Hallelujah when brother Branham was starting this message he said Yeti now uh part of person that he says now could you highly imagine Paul regarding himself a prisoner and a Born Free Man filled with the Holy Ghost but yet he called himself a prisoner and now we find out when he addressed in the Corinthian he said Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ another time he said Paul as seven of Jesus Christ by the word of God Amen when he's speaking to Trinity different ones now when he's writing to Philemon he said Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ Paul an apostle and they like to to preach one night on that Paul at seven preach on that and then Paul a prisoner so I try to follow brother Branham I'll try to take each one and preach on it praise the Lord but he started starting from the beginning I want to start from the end because later on when he went down in the message then he tells us about a prisoner of love so I want to start from a prisoner of love and then we will go back to Paul and the Apostle Paul a seven and then Paul a prisoner so well you like it on that I want to create a good picture this morning so we will understand this thought we have a body we have this body but in this body we have millions of cells and our cells genes and different things that run down from our parents and different things is all bottled up in this body in this body you have Ambitions you have potentials you have thoughts and all of that but yet is all of those things I control now this young man goswell in him everything that you would need to be a father is already in him praise the Lord he has Ambitions he has you know everything there are some things from his father brother Dan and some things from his grandfather and great-grandfather they are all into their body so look at the concept where I want to drive to here is that this body itself is a prison there are a lot of things that are held Behind the Walls of this flesh you are looking at praise the Lord even the rear mean is Behind These Walls what you what you are looking at is just uh uh uh uh uh I'm trying to look for the right word where is the first picture the mug shot the first picture you take when you get to praising is that how they call it when you get a prison that the first picture you come and you take your mark shot that's your praising picture buddy praise the Lord so what you're looking at this is my mark shot but the real guide is Behind These Walls praise the Lord now think about it this morning that the almighty God the great infinite God The God That Failed all time in all space praise the Lord will choose to bring all his infinite wisdom in his infinite power and he says a body will thou prepare me praise the Lord what I'm doing now and I'm trying to build the concept of a prisoner God deciding to live eternity and begin and break into time and condense himself into time for him to step down into time he had to praising himself because living eternity to break into time he will no longer do things as an internal being he will now have to establish time and season just like a prisoner you you can't eat any time you want to eat you can go to the basketball court anytime you want to your daily routine is scheduled in a prison there's all sufficient God that fill all space and time will now step himself down into time to give himself a first day praise the Lord then he goes back into praising the second day he comes out and do something then he goes back into praising the third day he comes out and do something then he goes back into so God put himself in a state where now and he had to work by the Lord of time even while he was in the body a body of Flesh he stayed hard His Infinite Wisdom but yet there are things he could not say because it was not the time praise the Lord and you grabbing the concept so you look through the scripture you see over and over you think about it God promising Abraham that he will be the father of Nations was it difficult for God to deal with Abraham bless Isaac right in that place and let Isaac have his children and God who established and start his own holy nation right in the land of Cana why he had to carry the people into prison Joseph Glory into praising and by Joseph Brothers coming to meet him the entire Seed of Abraham will be enslaved why would God do that why would God do that what is it about praising that God allowed all his children to go to praise him praise the Lord somebody in the prison of their will some this morning is in the prison of your mind praise the Lord have you ever thought about it why is called cell phone if you just break the word and look at it it's a cell for one person amen as a cell pH will take the word for one sell for one you are locked out in it it controls your life praise the Lord if you call it if you have an alarm to wake you up and that person set an alarm for people to go to bed they have a lamb to eat a lamb to drink or you really never thought about it that's yourself you are locked in it the day you go if I it looks like what's happened to me not just how when people stay alone in praising and they come out they cannot associate with the word with a free word because they're being so locked in praising and that's the same way we behave to our phones there is something about praising God design in the back part of his mind for him to deal with man and get man's attention he have to imprison him praise the Lord praise the Lord I have your mind running all over the place this morning it's okay amen Joseph went to praise in Jeremiah make higher and John the Baptist Peter and something he had to pick up his whole praising Gates on his shoulder praise the Lord took his prison gate to the mountain I hope the Lord can help us to pick up our praising gifts this morning amen I hope that we'll be able to get courage to be able to pick up our praise engage but there was something about praising God almighty God even our lord Jesus how to go to praise him oh yeah during this hour his last hour on the Earth for them to transfer him to go and see hero they got to keep him in praising for the next day and you see it's just like all around the world the prisons are not the same here you have praising where prisoners have television they're out of places you have praising we're praising us are confound to one condition they are in a prison like this they cannot go down they cannot come up they cannot go they can't sit down the prison is designed for them to be in this condition there are pigs all honor them you go down you're going to harm yourself you go up you're going to bleed yourself so all the presence around the world are different and that's the same way as as individuals our praising houses are different also and the things that are embracing in our lives are also different praise the Lord should we pray and go home it looks like everybody is captured this morning we can just committed the rest to the Lord and say holy ghost just deal with the people speak to their hearts but there is something about praising that God himself he says the heaven is my throne the Earth is my first tool but a body will thou prepare me God have all of this free space but yet he want a body to do it in in so much that the Apostle Paul was said the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet they are almighty God gives you the Holy Ghost but yet in dealing with you he's going to be subject to your will praise the Lord because when you are in prison you don't control the people that praising you the people that impressing you they control you they tell you how to dress the Lord no one carried their suitcases to praise him amen when you got a prison there's a close ready there for you praise the Lord all your juries they are all for the free word and in thou praising everybody looks alike so you think about it think about it now because brother Branham used this now that's the reason why he said yeah as I read he says uh he says I believe the Apostle men just not exactly addressing it in his present condition and do you also realize yeah I'm ahead of myself you know because I myself I'm trying to discover what I want to preach this morning do you also realize that it took Paul in those praising conditions to write the book of Ephesians the letter to the collusions and the book of Philippians praise the Lord I did this I did a little a little sketch of Paul of the events of poor life the first time he will he will be seen in the scripture the first time he will see him that one of the first action that we would know about this man he was a man that held the court was Stephen was stoned and right after the he got converted on the road of Damascus in the Arabian Desert during the next three years he was fought to flee from Damascus in a basket and then Paul spent 10 years in his own setting Saul of tashes he spent 10 years why because now Paul has been converted but he was isolated the Christians will not accept him because they are not sure he cannot go back to Judaism because they felt like he betrayed him so for 10 years Paul was in isolation right in his own setting every time he will go over to uh to the to the to the selling gas and all you he would try to tell these people about his experience on the road of Damascus and everybody you know what they don't they don't want to have anything to do with him praise the Lord so for 10 years he was in a prison amen the Christians don't want to have anything to do with him this is the man that was persecuting I mean Paul was well known but it was Barnabas that brought Paul amen where the Holy Ghost speaks and says separate me in Barnabas and Paul Brandon Bass was the one that brought Paul and introduced him to the apostles I believe that he sat one time and listened to Paul speaking and he realized that this man had another approached to the scripture this man he was caught different praise the Lord because remember after Paul got saved he stayed right there in Damascus so that time in Damascus I call into historians he spent three years on the back side of the desert trying to reconcile this light that caught itself Jesus he knew the light to be the pillar of fire but yet the light says I am Jesus whom you are persecuting Paul was trying to reconcile the Jehovah of the Old Testament with the Jesus of the new praise the Lord he spent three years and when he came out he was completely different until even the picture that the keys was giving told Peter said Paul spoke things that were hard to understand praise the Lord so he spent 10 years in Texas in Barnabas brought him to Antioch and then when the Holy Ghost said separate me Paul and Barnabas that was where Paul started his first missionary journey praise the Lord when we started talking about Paul the apostles we'll go over all of these I'm I'm just trying to run through some things here then as chapter 15 he was brought to the council when the when the Believers were were they were they were announced they were discussing how how they should treat the Gentiles that are now being safe praise the Lord you have to realize that these are Jewish Jewish Believers people that were that were that were circumcised on the eighth day they were taught the Torah in all of these things amen they have now God received the Holy Ghost and all of them and they realized that Gentiles are being saved they are now in a crisis how do we handle these people praise the Lord because Peter himself had a first-hand witness he hired a first-hand witness that why he stood in colena's house these people that were not baptized just by the preaching of the words there was something in this Gentile Believers that knew how to pull God out of heaven when Peter preached the word the Holy Ghost fell on them praise the Lord Hallelujah when you go and read as chapter 15 I'm all over the place but that's good when you reacts chapter 15 you will realize that the apostles they said something that is very is placed in a very corny way they said that it it seems like we need to receive the law like these Gentiles did they they have seen the Gentile way that the way God was dealing with the Gentiles amen then the way they the Jews I mean there were a lot of things they had to struggle with because these people were bringing in uh uh Judaism and whether you like it or not every one of us go through the same amen if you are if you were you grown up in a Methodist Church or in a in a Baptist Church or uh whatever was at the place that you've grown you learn the way they do things and now when you are born again don't think that you just change automatically no all of those things that you learn you carry it along that's the reason why some people that came through a Pentecostal Church they are always firing while the other Melodies people there you know they know how to paint things you know they sit there it does not make that one that is firing more religious than the other one or more spiritual than the other one no it is just that we carry those things along until God will now finally bring us to a birth so that was the same thing that these Jewish I believe us was struggling with there is Gentiles they never know how to watch their hands before eating praise the Lord when it comes to eat all the Jewish believer oh wow praise the Lord these guys don't wash their hands they don't even pray amen glory be to God even with the Apostle Peter that was trying try he was the man to have the key he was the one that opened the kingdom to the to the to the Gentiles in the house of Colina he was trying his best but yeah when he saw another Jews coming try to pull back Paul never spare him for that no praise the Lord so you see that the the the environment that we grew up the church you grew up in your you had a certain way of doing things like that you have you have a certain way you know the message was preached to you and all of that it does not make you better than the other person you know what it does it just put you in a separate prison and the other man is in his praising praise the Lord adjust that in your praising your things are arranged more decently in his praising he don't have even food he don't get television are we together so Paul goes on his first missionary journey after the council or before the council after the council then now Paul started reaching out that's how Paul started reaching out to the Gentiles that's how he he he took on the apostleship for the Gentiles praise the Lord and after that council meeting even when he came back he came back to the council because uh since the Jews refused him Paul was reaching out I mean he was he was doing his own thing he was reaching out he was so convinced of his experience on the road of Damascus that he did not need a council to support him right praise the Lord he did not needed a counsel to support him he was ready to tell his testimony to whoever he meets on the street as long as you were less empowered talk and even when you are going he's talking behind you praise the Lord now Paul will have his first arrest in 1858 he was in praising for two years this was more like a house arrest praise the Lord if you read a book of us you will realize this was the time where Paul was brought before uh uh uh Caesar he was supposed to be taken before Caesar and and the Jews said he was blaspheming and then and then and then the Romans came and arrested him and in the air Paul told them will you treat a rumor like this they said oh are you a Roman he said yeah I have Roman citizenship so actually the embracing poor to protect him praise the Lord because Paul hired Roman citizenship that he acquired through his father when we're talking about Paul uh a servant of Jesus Christ will go through that now so uh he was in praising and then he appeared before Caesar and then on his way to Rome that was where he had a shipwreck when the the the the the the snake was on his hand and all of that that was this is a little little of poor Journey then he had a house arrest that was where he wrote efficient the book of Philippine and and collusion then he was equated after that then he wrote trimite he his first letter to terminated and also to to Titus praise the Lord then he was now arrested and he knew by this time he was dumb we had him in the dungeon and that was where he wrote that letter to Timothy I have run my course I run I fight a good fight he wrote that from the dungeon praise the Lord so we so we see that Paul writing this letter to uh uh phaliman it was not just to complain that oh I'm in praising they are beating me every day you know uh uh you know you're playing with the gospel down there I'm suffering no that was not Paul message that was not the reason why he was writing but you think about it we will not have the Book of Revelation until John was thrown on the island of Patmos they're in praising him on the island of Patmos yes and then God found him now to a place all by himself are you are you grabbing the concept that why God will put us in the prison that's the time that God loved he loved that time when you are locked up in your mind when you are praising in your mind you are shut up praise the Lord it will surprise you but let me read this to you before I go any father Brown said you have heard that all song you think and then I'm shocking with God I want to be shocked in with God now is where I thought of this being shot in with God chatting with God in the secret place brother Branham says that's where my inspiration came from what is it to be shot in with God what is it to be shot in with God praise the Lord amen God great purpose of drinking Israel into Egypt who have never been fulfilled if Joseph would have gained all the favor that he how was Spotify God had to switch the wheel around and lustful Spirit came over part of our wife and now she won this boy for a boyfriend but young Joseph will not sell his breath right but you have to realize it's beyond the will of Joseph almighty God is the one driving the wheel that I have a purpose of redemption and to fulfill this purpose I have to lock this ball up in praising amen it is in prison that Joseph will self-convenient you really enjoy communion in prison then Joseph said the one and that's where her prophetic gift was known and that's what will bring him to the throne and Israel comes to Egypt and God's Plan of Redemption praise the Lord I mean if you lock yourself up and you have the key that's not a prison some of us the president we are in we having a key that's not a prison the keys must be in the hands of another person if you have the keys it's not a prison you just don't want to talk to anybody you are just having your mood swings you cut your phone off you don't want to know for anybody to know what you are doing the day you ready you open it you come outside then you come and says oh love you brother God bless you Sister God bless you now you want everybody now to get on board with you when you definitely shutting yourself up you never told why you were shut up praise the Lord that's not a prison The Prisoner do not have a key to his own praising someone else's has the key glory be to God but you see that sir I realized my time is getting off here I've not even started yet but you see yes uh you know I saw uh Birdman will help us to to realize here is that finally finally finally God will get himself a prisoner of love finally finally amen we deal with the the praising of our human nature we deal with acne prison and and self-present and different praising we deal with and and but finally when God comes down and start dealing with a man or dealing with a woman finally he will bring us true gradually where he will get himself a prisoner of love someone that loves to be in the will of God that Lord that enjoy when I says everything were for good to them that loved the Lord someone that enjoyed being in the word of God there are no matter in their life they take joy to know that they are in his will praise the Lord finally and brothers and sisters if I don't finish my talk this morning you can bet me I can I'll preach you the rest of the Year Praise the Lord but finally that's what God is doing to this bride his purpose of having a preeminist he also have a people that he can get in the confine of his will a people that we enjoy being in the word of God whenever they understand that their step or their thoughts or their action is not pleasing to God it will bother them so much right yeah they were had to know that they are they are pleasing themselves they will always be their question what would Jesus do what is God thinking about my action is this thing I'm doing the same pleasing to God will finally get a people that we get into the prison of his will but I just wanted to establish with you this morning now after all praising is not a bad place because what are you lacking or not you are in one you are in one your true potential is here it's his badge they have your mark shot on it praise the Lord amen your true potential is hate behind those bars it's a bias of Bones what are you lacking on that you are a prisoner this morning you are a prisoner this morning you might not be a prisoner of love yet maybe you are a prisoner to your own will you find people on the street that are praising us to drugs young people prayer you know all around us prisoner to sex prisoner to all the evil things that is happening there is something that is driving them they don't have their own will they are locked out in there if you will ask them they want to be better than that behind those desires true some of us are locked up in our mind we are in a dungeon that is so dark praise the Lord when you just find a person that is just just negative everything they are just seeing spirits coming from all over that's what happened in the dungeon dark make you afraid some people are so block out in their mind in their spirit it's God's design for God to manifest his will and make knew his attributes he had to praise himself he had to prison himself why because God how to condense himself put himself in a state that he had to allow something to happen why would God allow us to get sick just for us to know that he's a Healer so he he embraced himself to our weakness he limits himself there is no way that he will make his attributes no until he put himself behind our free moral agency he says okay I will wait for them to choose now I want to choose whatever they will do then I will come and show myself a deliverer almighty God do that why would he do that this man on the backside of the desert God could just revealed to him he could reveal to him and and I want you to write the book of uh uh a collusion write the book of Ephesians why would God wait for Paul to get in prison right because sometimes that's when he get the best out of us when we are shouting with God praise the Lord amen it is God that wrote the five law of language and God lacks quality time and sometimes the way that he can get quality time out of us is to lock us and carry the key praise the Lord then he comes through the window and they enter he says I'm here with you oh Lord Jesus well I just want to spend time with you again the short break in the Sheep leg he said you look at the Shepherd from fire you will think that he's cruel but if you look in the heart of the shepherd it's an expression of love right sir it's an expression of love God own people the Jews who they have history the history of praising and slavery in their entire history praising and slavery praise the Lord and do you realize that's one of the team of the of of uh of uh of the ATS movement because they're trying to prove that slavery is from the Bible but you don't understand the purpose you don't understand the purpose praise the Lord you have just got so messed up into the politics that you don't understand the purpose why God designed that do you also know that the early church the early Christian Church was made out of praising us and people that were that were slaves worker that's exactly why Paul is addressing here in the book of alimon this is a slave that ran away from his master this is a slave that ran away from his master he might have robbed him or take something and he ran away he got arrested they be thrown in the same prison with Paul and when Paul brought him to Faith then Paul realized that his master was also a son of Paul praise the Lord because Fatima was a he was a convert of Paul so now Paul is selling this slave back to his master but charging the master and now he's a brother he's now yours he he I'm not saying that he's not your slave but the most emphasis here he's a brother praise the Lord you read a letter you realize Paul never instructed him to set the man free Paul instructed him to discern yeah he's not coming back as a runaway slave he's coming back as a brother praise the Lord you have to picture in the book of Acts there were many many of those groups home groups were the Masters and their slave uh uh uh people that were slipped to them were coming right there to be preached home why were God why will God you see because the fall put us enslaved by the Fall we became slave to sin we became slave to our own evil desires so you might have never been on a ship in Chains your physical body may have never gone unawipped but nobody here will tell me that their spirit has not been under one suppression or another that the devil has never come back to whip your mind over and over for the wrong that you have done so you see in a great that the big picture of God's mind looking at right from the beginning that man by his free moral agents saying will trap himself he will trap or enslave himself and then God will have to come down and break that chains of slavery by his spirit praise the Lord And yet when he free man he will not allow the man to have his own will but he will put him in another prison yeah because God understands I think that's the best way that man can live praise the Lord are we together this morning amen have I gone all over the place just shouting making noise and you don't understand what I'm talking about I don't have problems starting over I might not say it like the way I said it first but I don't have no problem to start over I mean even if you don't want it today I can do it another day but I'm just trying to help us to realize that's the purpose here there's a purpose but then brought a brand I'm saying your family finally it took all of these ages to bring us to the age where the mind of God will be released to the people for them to finally realize why God allowed all of this praising and slavery all through history it was not to make one man Superior and to make another man inferior that's politics that's what the news want to sell to us and if you are a born-again child of God you get your spirit all mess in that I mean you will just destroy yourself because there is no way you will be able to project the love of God because your mind is all caught up in the politics of the word thinking that one group is superior over another that was not God's purpose praise the Lord Hallelujah it's so sad that you find people claiming to have the Holy Ghost they are so tied into that praise the Lord your mind is just they are so I mean their spirit is just locked up in that prisoner of love that's cause purpose that's where he wants to bring us to I was sitting there and just just thinking about this Broadband said over in the book of Corinthian process Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ and then so Timothy he said Paul at 7. of Jesus Christ now you have to realize that Timothy was a pastor and Paul had to approach him like that because Paul wanted him to understand the purpose of the ministry amen so we find that right in there we can see the purpose and the work of the ministry as an apostle the purpose is to reach out and be ready to reach everyone and be ready to reach anyone praise the Lord amen one that is sin is not just on a sin to his tribe and as a servant of Jesus Christ it destroyed the work of the ministry you are not sent to bust the people you are sent as a servant to Serve the People and you can own it fulfill the apostleship the seventh shape when you are a prisoner to his will when you are going with your own ambition and selfish desire you will never fulfill God's purpose because you will have certain group you can go to and certain group you can go to because you are caught up in the racial wall of of America praise the Lord amen you cannot be a truth apostle that way if you are not if you are not in the prison of as well you cannot even be a true servant you will bust the people when you are supposed to be saving the people um I don't want to go ahead of myself I told you it's the rest of the year amen the rest of the year we'll have to dig into it this is just a foundation I don't know how many messages I've done foundation for I've not put a break on it yet praise the Lord we just we just did a foundation of authors and we didn't put break on it now we're doing the foundation of praising us glory be to God but let the Lord have his way amen you love the Lord let's give the Lord Jesus a hand of Praise what a wonderful Jesus we shall ah think about it that the all-powerful god they're all powerful God their great internal spirit who come to the world in you and he was subject himself he will give you the key and he says I can do all things but take the key all things are possible to you I'm in you now and I'm I'm imprisoned by you I can do all things anything you want me to do but it will have to be by you all things are possible to them that believe praise the Lord he's there he's here but yeah we say we can't see anything it's not his fault praise the Lord you don't know how to use the key you don't know how to use the key you keep him locked inside and you're trying to do everything by yourself when all power for God has subject himself to you are you sick come on savior healer come outside he's going to step out and he will be your healer praise the Lord if you are in need open the door and said you provide all my needs he's going to step outside and yet we limit him we lock him inside praise the Lord we lock him up and we allowing our safe selfish will to pull us year and there through the hustle and the Basel and this and all of that right and he's just sitting down he says if the only knew how I fell two million people in the wilderness there was not a warmer there was not an urgent care took care of them if they only knew that praise the Lord if they only knew that now and I've given them the keys they locked me in oh wow they locked me you know praise the Lord and he yeah you shouting in another room it's just like the Philippian Jailer when he came here he saw all the prisoners gone because at that time if you were the jail keeper you give your life for those people's life amen so he took the swollen and and you almost the Paul said don't do that but if we are here we're back here amen but then he was astonished while I guess Brooklyn these guys are gone and you are not gone praise the Lord then Paul says after all we were just thinking last night it brought an earthquake well just praising Garden it brought an earthquake oh they're all gone oh wow I didn't know that I want to bet around 5 30 this morning just praying and worshiping God but don't take your life praise the Lord because the same ones that opened this present can open your present too praise the Lord Hallelujah we're going to have a Prison Break I'm looking forward for the Prison Break we will not have a room to contain it praise the Lord you're looking at me like you don't know what I'm talking about you don't know but let's uh let let the prison break takes place I'm looking forward for the Prison Break we are locking up true sons of God behind our selfish nature behind our our human desires when there's a true Son of God behind our body right a true daughter of God Larry some sinful desire to control us but don't worry praise him break is coming I'm announcing it to you don't tell anybody [Laughter] Prison Break is coming you just got to be ready I'm just told to tell

them but when praise him break him praise the Lord When Praise Him break him into the street the way Hallelujah these men are not drunk as you think but this is the teddy Prison Break is coming it's not coming Prison Break is here praise the Lord praise him break is here he loved the Lord but just think about it God has a purpose God has a purpose if God never design you the way he designed you if he never kept you in the nature that you were he would have never found you he in praising you in that nature because that was the easier way for him to find you now he have found you he want to bring you out and introduce you to his real purpose praise the Lord don't get mad when you're praising you have to be glad I'm so glad I was here You Found Me Lord I was so glad I was in this state
