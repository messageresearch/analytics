========================================
[music] [music] this and I wrote jotted something down in there when brother God's um gifts are always fi God's gifts always find their place God's gifts is always rejected but it really finds its place when now watch the gift that these wise men bought are brought to him. Today we find that we're swapping gifts. Everybody has to get a gift and try to figure out what the next fella is going to give him so he can give him something comparing that much. And if it isn't on New Year's, he feels he has to make it up. And each one studying worrying, walking the floor, the millionaires, how they're going to get by to give so much to this one and that when it's it's all together wrong. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's all together. Christmas, here's his only one gift that you can give and that is yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to God because God's already gi to you his gift. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there's only one thing you owe back to God. That's yourself to him. &gt;&gt; Now, and many times names uh in the Bible, we don't notice it no more today. We uh you've often heard me scorn this name of children calling or people calling their children Ricky. Now, Ricky is a horrible name. See, and it's you mustn't uh call him that. If you got a child named Ricky, for goodness sakes, change it something else. Uh Ricky or or Elvis or something like that, Ricky means a rat. See, and so you you and and what you call a person that impresses that. Uh a little lady the other day had a little boy out there called Ricky and his name's uh Ricky, James Ricky. And because it was so Hopper Ricky, they called him Ricky. I said, "Change that name." I know some people sitting right here now got a little grandson and his uh name is uh the one one little boy is a sweetest pleasantest little fell and the other is Ricky and that's what he is. You just watch him. His nature is just like that and he I said to some of his grandparents or somewhere I said tell the mother change the name of that boy. Just change that name over and watch what happens to the kid. See if people don't want to believe that. We think we've lived too long for that. If there isn't something in a name, then why as long as Jacob was called Jacob, which means suppler, deceiver, that's what he was. But when he wrestled with the Lord all night, and the Lord changed his name and about when he's about 60 years old, he changed his name from from uh from Jacob to Israel, a prince before God. And that's what he was. Why was Abram called had to be called Abraham before the baby could be born? Why is Sarah called Sarah before the baby could be born? Why was Paul or call his name was Saul? But when he met Jesus, he changed him from Saul to Paul. when Simon was changed from Simon to Peter which means little stone and uh all their names were changed is because what you are called is something about it. When you speak something it identifies itself. I don't want to get in there cuz that's coming up next Sunday night. See identification of a word. And um but now we find these things so true. Now watch God. What a strange thing it is tonight to see that those man magis learned man great man coming down from the east that was Babylon which is India and they never come in any uh all night started one night got there the next it was about two years getting there they never come to a little baby in a manger they come to a young child young child and Herod killed the children from two years old u uh see to know that it wasn't a little infant laying in a cradle he just killed all infants, but he killed the young children so he'd be sure to get him. Anywhere from two years old back. He set the time up because knowing he didn't want to kill too many, all of them. He because they were more like slaves to him. He wanted to get be sure to get so he said the kid be about 2 years old. So everything from 2 years old down kill it. See, and that brought to pass what the prophet said. as in and Rama there. They heard a a screaming or crying, a weeping that racial weeping for her children and they were not. Now did you notice that these wise men great man was up in Babin and they saw his star. We said we have saw his star in the east and are come to worship him. They come from the east where they saw the star going west because India is west northwest of ba of of Palestine and they come right down through the Tigers River and crossed over the plains right on and come down into Bethlehem where they found the the the baby. Remember Joseph and them never left there. They went right down to Nazareth brought the child up right there. Now we uh see here that they presented these men being astronomers and studying the stars and seen these mysterious heavenly lights appear up there that there was something going on that they know that this Messiah, the the ruler of heavens and earth was to be born and they come knowing that deity would be enclosed and housed. in a a human being. Paul's to show you their testimony. You know, you know, your life speaks so much louder than your words till no matter what you say, people know what you are, but what you are. And watch these people, these magi, they brought him, watch the gifts. They brought him identified what they thought he was. They brought him gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And now watch what these symbols that I want to talk to you about now is what these symbols mean. Now I've got some scripture wrote out here that we'll read just in a moment on it the Lord willing. Now gold and frankincense and myrr. Now gold in the Bible uh how fitting it fits the Christ because gold speaks of deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gold is deity. We'll get to it just in a moment. Frankincense speaks of service and mirror is death. God deity in service to die. And that's what he was. The very thing that they brought identify what they thought he was. And I'll say that to us today. the things that we bring to him. Identify what our thoughts is about him. &gt;&gt; You understand what I mean? See, if you're if you believe it with all your heart, every word of that, you will identify it by giving all that you have to it. See, but if you believe it's a good place to associate with better people around church and things like that, that's just about what you give. just a few social hours with some of the congregation or something. But if you if you really believe it with all your heart, then you give everything that's in you to see and it identifies you that you truly believe the message that you believe it to be the truth. So many people say, "I can believe this much. I can believe." So the disciples I believe the last time here I spoke on that believers make believers not unbelievers. Well, I did I speak on that here. See and each person watch their category. be will come to a place where they can take so much of it can't take the rest. Now, how fitting these gifts was to Christ journey on earth, a baby born here on earth and these gifts that the wise man brought him fitted just exactly his commission from God and his journey on earth. Now, the first thing, God, this was God. Jesus was God in the form of man. That's hard for people to swallow that even today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That he was God. And he that's what he was. He was nothing less than God. He was God manifested in place. He was the creator in his own creation. &gt;&gt; That he was a creator in his creation. by the creation. For the creation he was a creator in his creation, by his creation, for his creation all winds right back in God the whole thing. Don't you see? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a creator in so much that he was God and he was a being on earth, a being of time, which mean that he must had a beginning. Therefore, he created himself a body to live in. &gt;&gt; God himself created a body for himself. See, that by this creation, he might save the lost creation that he had created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is nothing that man can annihilate. There isn't one thing. You can't do nothing to completely destroy anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might take a piece of paper and burn it up. You might burn a building down. You might burn a tree down. You didn't annihilate it. You That heat in there, that fire that breaks up. That's only chemicals bursting. They're turning back to what they was at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They're not annihilated. If you burn up a piece of wood and the world say if we lived in eternity like God and that chemicals out of that wood and that fire went back to its original beginnings and it's and whatever it was the breakings of the atoms and so forth, the the world say would stand for millions of years that could come right straight back again and be another tree just exactly like it was. You cannot annihilate anything because it is the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, that gets me feel religious now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, what God says is it forever stands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you cannot annihilate. We are part of this earth and we can never be completely annihilated. No sir. The sin the soul will be annihilated. We realize that. But the the body that we live in cannot be annihilated. Amen. See now therefore God created himself a body. He was a creator and created his own creation that by this creation he might save them that were lost in his creation. That's you and I, creatures of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His His word exactly showed that he and his works proved that he was nothing less than the creator. He took a piece of bread and broke it and kept breaking that one piece of bread and fed 5,000 people out of it and took up seven basketfuls of pieces left over. &gt;&gt; And everybody there had a a a complete filling of bread. He took a fish and broke that fish off. Uh we realize that he did create that fish in the beginning. &gt;&gt; He did create that bread in the beginning. But he took that fish and broke that fish off. A live fish had been and was then boiled or or fried. And whenever he broke it all, whatever it was, boiled or fried, it grow back. The same minute that he broke it, another bought a fried fish. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; That showed that he was nothing less than Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was a creator &gt;&gt; that could take his own creation and by his creation express who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's proved he was what he was. &gt;&gt; He was deity. So gold was becoming to him in the offering at his birth. He was deity made flesh. Am I no strangers among us tonight I suppose? So in this prayer meeting but let me say something. Did Jesus when he was sure now this is for thinking now for pro probably broken rather notice just for thinking Jesus said in St. John 14:12 He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater than this shall he do, for I go to my father." Did you notice that? Notice now that was the son of God promising to the believer that greater things that he did and these thy faith that the believer would do greater things than he did. St. John 14th chapter 12th verse. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe Jesus said it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice when Jesus created bread, he took a piece of bread and created bread that had already been bread. When he created fish, he took a fish that was first created a fish and put another fish out of it. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He took water which potentially would have become wine and made wine out of it. Is that right? But we seem in our midst in this last days create things right out without anything standing there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That create a squirrel where there is no squirrel. &gt;&gt; Right. Oh, he's remains God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's just as much deity today as he was then ever was or ever will be. &gt;&gt; He's still God and challenging hearts to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Greater things than this you without anything to hold and break off of. Speak it in. Notice now we find that he's he identified the works that he did identify that he was deity. &gt;&gt; Show him that he was. &gt;&gt; For he said, "If I do not the works of my father, then don't believe me." And could not the Christian say today, if I do not the works of my Savior. Believe me not. Hey, as the Father sent me, so I you and if he did the works creation works of the father that sent him, then the Christ the creator that sends us does the works of Christ the creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, as the father sent me, so send I do not the works of my father believe me not. that the Christian today has got to do the life that Christ did &gt;&gt; or we have a right to say it's not. So notice now his works created him or identified him to be the creator. His works that he did crown his life's testimony that he was the creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No way of getting away from it. Therefore, when they offered a gift of gold, they were perfectly in harmony with God, &gt;&gt; with their gift. They gave him gold, which identified him as deity. Always a crown, the golden crown, the golden head of King Nebuchadnezzy is represented by gold. Now, frankincense, we want to get these quickly. Frankincense is the offering of service to Jehovah. Now, if you want to put these scriptures down, Leviticus 2:2 and Leviticus 16 6-15, we find out that's the order of the priesthood to make an offering to Jehovah. When he made the offering, it had to be made and mixed with frankincense. For sin offerings, they took different things and mixed it. For the meal offering, for the wave offerings, frankincense was added because it was acceptable to Jehovah if it was anointed with frankincense, which means it is a service to Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God. And now we find out he's deity. And they brought him frankincense was a type that he was a service to Jehovah. Jesus is Jehovah's servant. Now in St. Matthew 12:15-21, we find out that he was Jehovah's servant. Behold my servant whom I'm well pleased. And he was I put my strength upon him. So his life was anointed with frankincense to Jehovah's servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a gift them wise men gave. See, it was something to the the gift that they give was something to identify Jesus as Jehovah's servant. Now, if we could only do that to identify our lives, the our lives to be identified as Jehovah's servant. That's what preconcepts was for. That made him Jehovah's servant. Now myra m y r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r h was anointing of the death. We find in St. John the 19th chapter the 39th verse that going to the the funeral service of Jesus when Mary and them went they taken this ma to anoint him with because he must be the servant of death for Jehovah. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, somebody had to die. That was a service that had to be done for God. And nobody was worthy to do it but God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. So bringing the mirror mirror showing that with the deity and with the service that he also was anointed with mirror that this deity had to be put to death &gt;&gt; in order to save the imperfect one. Oh what a great thing. The whole creation was lost. We just went through it in the seven seals. See the whole creation was lost. Everything was gone. It all belonged to Satan. He fell heir to it and he still owns it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; he certainly does. That's the reason we're fighting, having all this trouble. He controls every kingdom. Satan does. Every government, every king, every kingdom controlled by Satan. The whole world is controlled and run by Satan. That's really the troubles that we have. Any Bible student or anything can tell you that Satan, well, the Bible itself says he did. That he controls the world. But Christ will fall heir to it. For now he is our redeemer and he come to redeem the whole creation and nothing could do it but God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason God does nothing outside of a man. He always works through a man because he had to use a man. A man is what he had to use to display his attribute of savior. He had to make him in his image, make him something like him and put him on free moral agency and let him act any way he wanted to. He could take his choice. And he knew that man by giving him this choice would fall. So being that he had to do that, he turns back around and makes a man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it through a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The whole work of redemption come by a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Death come by the first man. &gt;&gt; Life came by the second Adam. &gt;&gt; There you are. He does nothing because he had to use the man for that. Then he uses the man to redeem back again. So deity become Jehovah or Jehovah be he is deity and he become a a child. He become in the form of sin that he might redeem the sinner. &gt;&gt; Yes. that he has the whole thing. Now look how beautiful those gifts fit into Jesus Christ. See gold speaking of his deity. Now they wasn't heathens. They were inspired by God. They wasn't imagining something. That proves right there even the magi that they did see the supernatural &gt;&gt; because their own gift that they offered identify it and spoke well of their testimony &gt;&gt; that they did see the supernatural light because why it speaks perfectly. They brought gold deity they brought frankincense service and they brought myrr for his death when he was a baby. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Showing that deity would be put to death in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. That it might redeem fallen man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How can people turn that down? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you realize what are we doing here? Where did we come from? How what business we got being here? We wasn't put here just by chance. We were put here for a purpose. And we must serve that purpose. But still, we're back on the basis of free moral agency where we can serve it or reject it just like Adam did in the beginning. Now look, these little girls here, brother, what a little lady play the piano and I was hearing them as they sang. We were talking about them on the road up here. There's a little family that's dedicated their whole life and everything to Christ. Look at that family, how orderly it is. Look at that little girl. They stand up here. example of young womanhood of teenage and no matter a few weeks ago I went out and like I don't know what the name of the place is down there in New York now where they just got city blocks of beat necks that them girls down there with with legots on and and uh nothing little bikini they caught it over the top of that and oh just the they do anything it's in their mind no matter what it is that's what why they're beat they can just do anything if they want to lay down don't get up, they lay down, don't get up. If they want to go do a certain thing, they do it. If they don't, they don't. Just their mind just traveling. And what does the unconverted mind come to? You have no right to do that because you're not your own. You're but a deity, Jesus Christ, the son of God that was made flesh. &gt;&gt; But see the conglomeration of sin and you see a little young girls like that stand out. Why to me it's light in the time of darkness. It's a parking lot of the zigzag whip of God in the skies to show there can be life. &gt;&gt; There can be righteousness &gt;&gt; in the midst of sin. Mary, the mother of Jesus in the city of Nazareth, the meanest city there was in the land. BUT OUT OF THERE, GOD chose a little lady to give birth to his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aabadator, a womb that had to a baby had to be born by. And he took such a person to do it. God works through human beings to redeem human beings. He can take you work to you to redeem humanity. If you'll completely dedicate everything you are, if you're a young woman, dedicate your morals. You're a young man, dedicate your morals. Dedicate your mind, dedicate your thinking, dedicate your heart, dedicate your soul, dedicate all your &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music]
