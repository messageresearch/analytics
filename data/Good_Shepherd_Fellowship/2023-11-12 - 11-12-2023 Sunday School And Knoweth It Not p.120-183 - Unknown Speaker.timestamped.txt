[0:00] [Music]
[0:34] his very whole
[0:37] purpose was the
[0:41] church now how do we get into this
[0:44] church by one Spirit we're all baptized
[0:47] into one
[0:48] body the church the body of
[0:51] Christ it cannot fail now here's what
[0:55] happens now watch this just a little
[0:57] figurative picture here now this outside
[1:00] man is the flesh that's what we look at
[1:04] what we
[1:05] see and it has five inlets to that body
[1:10] and any grammar school child as myself
[1:13] would know these five senses control the
[1:15] body seed taste feel smell and here
[1:17] without that you can't touch the body
[1:20] that's the only way you have to the body
[1:22] seed taste feel smell here you see it
[1:26] taste it feel it now that is the evil
[1:28] one on the
[1:32] outside now inside of that is a spirit
[1:36] which you become when you're born in the
[1:38] earth and the Breath of Life is breathed
[1:40] into it that spirit is of a worldly
[1:45] nature because it was not given from God
[1:50] but it was given permitted by
[1:53] God now you got that for every child
[1:57] that's born in the world is born in sin
[1:59] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[2:01] speaking lies is that right so that
[2:05] person inside there is a sinner to begin
[2:09] with now but now it's got five
[2:14] inlets and that five inlets I don't know
[2:17] where call them right off now whe first
[2:19] I know is
[2:20] thought
[2:22] conscience and love choice no conscience
[2:28] love reason
[2:30] there's five inlets to the spirit you
[2:33] can't think with your body you have to
[2:35] think with your spirit you can't have
[2:38] conscience in your body it has no mental
[2:40] faculties at all your body doesn't so
[2:43] you have to think with your spirit you
[2:46] have to the reason you can't reason with
[2:48] your physical being because reason
[2:50] doesn't see taste feel smell ear reason
[2:52] is what you can make in your mind if
[2:55] you're asleep or you're out your body's
[2:57] laying there dead but your spirit can
[2:59] still
[3:00] reason these five senses that controls
[3:03] that Inside
[3:06] Man and that thou to the last
[3:11] man which is the soul there's only one
[3:15] sense that controls
[3:18] that and that is
[3:21] free moral agencies free will to choose
[3:26] or to
[3:28] reject and now the re reason that people
[3:32] today now don't forget this now you
[3:34] you'll see what the holy what the
[3:36] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[3:38] see now people can live in this spirit
[3:42] and they dance in the spirit they shout
[3:45] in the spirit they go to church in the
[3:48] spirit and they can absolutely have the
[3:52] real spirit of God anointed on that
[3:54] Spirit but still be lost and just as
[3:58] devil possessed as they can be with that
[4:01] spirit because watch that's the reason
[4:04] you couldn't tell that woman she was
[4:05] wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't
[4:08] tell her Bob and her hair was wrong well
[4:11] what's your hair Got to Do With It Well
[4:13] it did to
[4:17] Samson whosoever shall add one word to
[4:21] this or take one word from it you've got
[4:23] to have an ultimate
[4:25] somewhere now for instance if I was a a
[4:29] a Baptist man and you come down and told
[4:32] me I must be I must be baptized in the
[4:35] name of Jesus Christ it's in the Bible
[4:39] well the first thing you know I ask my
[4:41] pastor and I go to the pastor he say oh
[4:44] that's something back there see yeah see
[4:47] uh we Baptist here's what we believe we
[4:50] believe that we should be immersed in
[4:51] the titles of father son Holy Ghost
[4:53] that's way all the church has done it
[4:55] since John Smith founded it that's where
[4:57] it's done well that's your timate heck
[4:59] with what that guy says what if you're a
[5:02] Methodist and sprinkling is your system
[5:05] and you are told you must be immersed
[5:07] see what I mean you go back to the
[5:09] Methodist Pastor he'll right and ask the
[5:11] bishop so and so said so and so about
[5:13] this but we the Methodist Church who was
[5:15] founded 3 or 400 years ago in England by
[5:17] John Wesley and Whitfield and all the
[5:21] rest of them there in Asbury we founded
[5:24] this document following John Wesley that
[5:28] we are to be sprinkled because it's just
[5:30] an outward em farm and we think it's
[5:33] sprinkling is just as good as it is the
[5:35] other way if you're a real if the
[5:37] Methodist Church is your timation that's
[5:39] as far as you
[5:41] go if you're a Catholic and I tell you
[5:44] it's not in the Bible not to eat meat on
[5:47] uh Fridays and all these things I guess
[5:49] the Holy Eucharist isn't a way wafer
[5:51] because it's a spirit and so forth and
[5:53] you go to your priest the priest say
[5:54] here it is wrote right in our document
[5:57] and if the church is your ultimate you
[5:59] don't give a hoot what anybody says
[6:01] that's your
[6:04] ultimate oh God help this to sink in to
[6:08] me the whole thing's
[6:11] wrong God word is the
[6:16] ultimate whatever that word says then
[6:19] that's right now the only way up here in
[6:21] these SP spheres that you could ever be
[6:24] in this little Inside Man that you have
[6:28] to be for are deed because you was with
[6:31] God you're a part of God I was in my
[6:35] father I also was in my grandfather my
[6:38] grandfather's grandfather by seed I was
[6:42] in
[6:43] that and I was in
[6:46] Christ you were in Christ before the
[6:50] foundation of the world he came to
[6:53] redeem his own his own that was in him
[6:57] amen hallelujah
[7:00] his
[7:01] children that was in
[7:03] him you never came to to say the devil's
[7:08] children they never will know it am and
[7:12] they are so
[7:13] shrewd in the ways of their intellectual
[7:16] learning that you can't compare with
[7:18] them at all you can out talk
[7:22] them but by faith you sit now science
[7:27] don't need any faith science proves what
[7:30] they're talking about it doesn't need
[7:32] any faith the Catholic preach will tell
[7:35] you look how long the Catholic church is
[7:37] waved look how long she stood under the
[7:39] persecutions of
[7:42] paganism the Methodist Church said look
[7:44] here how long I've seen a church talk
[7:46] about a hypocrite sign coming up the
[7:48] road yesterday I seen said the Church of
[7:51] Christ established
[7:54] ad33 and ain't 100 years old yet the
[7:58] denomination
[8:00] oh my doctrine of the
[8:03] Apostles hardly got anything they're the
[8:05] Sadducees of the day no Spirit no and
[8:09] you can't tell
[8:11] them you can't talk to them you can't
[8:13] reason with
[8:15] them because we go beyond
[8:18] reasoning lean not to your own
[8:20] understanding amen Faith doesn't reason
[8:22] at all Faith believes it they say now
[8:25] look here you believe we have to do
[8:27] these things back there nonsense that
[8:29] but the Bible said so I can't explain
[8:32] how it happens but it
[8:34] happens God said so so you don't have I
[8:38] can't tell you nothing about
[8:40] it Faith doesn't explain
[8:43] it did you know that Faith just believes
[8:48] it Jesus said to Nicodemus from The
[8:51] ecumenical counsil of his day come to
[8:54] him tonight said Master we know your a
[8:57] teacher comes from God cuz no man could
[8:58] do the things you knew unless God is
[9:00] with him he said verely I S you except
[9:02] the man be born again he can't even see
[9:04] the kingdom but God said me an old man
[9:06] entered into my mother's wounds to be
[9:07] born he said now how I'm going going to
[9:09] tell you Heavenly things when you won't
[9:11] even believe Earthly
[9:14] things then he said one day except you
[9:17] eat the Flesh of the son of man drink
[9:18] his blood you have no life in you he
[9:20] didn't explain
[9:21] it those are Apostles and them of that
[9:25] day who was ordained to life he noted
[9:30] said all the father has given me will
[9:32] come
[9:33] amen only thing I have to do is just
[9:35] make my voice KN they know it for my
[9:38] sheep know my
[9:40] voice and a voice is a word
[9:45] expressed they believe it anyhow they
[9:48] don't have to scientifically prove
[9:49] anything or ask any sadducee or Pharisee
[9:51] or anything else about it I said it they
[9:54] believe it for my sheep hear my voice
[9:58] and this is the voice of God in letter
[10:00] form because this is the entire
[10:03] revelation of Jesus Christ Old and New
[10:05] Testament put together
[10:07] am
[10:09] amen there you are why you say these are
[10:13] good people what makes them because one
[10:17] thing their TI poost is on a
[10:21] church and in here you remember last
[10:24] Sunday it's a week ago how many was here
[10:25] and hear the sermon on the anointed ones
[10:27] in the last days I think all of you see
[10:31] they are anointed their Spirits are
[10:34] anointed in the second realm now that
[10:37] first woman says no she don't give a
[10:40] hoot what the church says what anybody
[10:42] else says she's a Smart Dock she's got
[10:45] college education she can put it over on
[10:47] her husband and think she's smart by
[10:48] doing that this other woman is naked
[10:52] blind and don't know
[10:54] it oh it's pitiful but that's a picture
[10:57] the Bible paints us
[10:59] yeah as she goes to church that woman
[11:02] would probably be
[11:04] better that woman would be she lives a
[11:07] good clean life there's nothing against
[11:09] that God will be the judge of it I don't
[11:11] know I'm not the judge I'm only the
[11:15] responsible for what he shows
[11:17] me that's what the Apostle said we do
[11:20] speak that what we know what we heard
[11:22] what we seen that's all I'm responsible
[11:24] for that's all you're responsible for
[11:27] but now see if you take that same woman
[11:30] where did she wind up at see she moved
[11:33] right around she heard no doubt turn her
[11:35] radio many times the voice of God has
[11:38] been speaking many times when I see she
[11:40] comes over into this cult here a clan
[11:45] all churches are
[11:47] Clans everything exactly right there are
[11:50] just lodges where people group together
[11:53] as membership and she comes over in here
[11:56] well that fits her just right now if you
[11:58] go to telling her what she has to do she
[12:00] won't listen to you you short to in her
[12:03] Bible she won't listen to it now my dear
[12:06] brother sister just one or two more
[12:08] comments before closing it's quarter
[12:10] till time to lay out 15 minutes now look
[12:13] I want to ask you something why can't
[12:15] that woman see
[12:19] it why can't
[12:21] she as far as being in adultery
[12:25] physically to her husband she's not
[12:27] guilty she has nothing to confess she's
[12:30] clean as she was the day she was born no
[12:32] man has touched her I'm speaking
[12:34] parallel now to the woman to the church
[12:37] she as clean as she was
[12:39] born well that's exactly what the church
[12:42] is as she was born but she was bored in
[12:46] sin shaped in
[12:49] iniquity see what I
[12:51] mean now you tell her that it's wrong
[12:54] for her to cut her hair the Bible said
[12:57] so it's wrong for her to wear them
[12:59] shorts the Bible said so she said
[13:02] nonsense why her ultimate is not down
[13:05] here in a third man the soul that's
[13:09] predestinated and sent from God but her
[13:12] ultimate is on an organization out here
[13:15] that some man is organized outside of
[13:18] this see but if the word of God is down
[13:22] in that Soul it says
[13:25] amen I see it it lines up with it now
[13:28] look here therefore the man that's born
[13:32] of the spirit of God see here's the
[13:35] outside flesh I speak in a mixed
[13:38] audience but I speak as your as your
[13:40] pastor as your brother here's the flesh
[13:44] it's weak it's bound to a little lady
[13:48] walks down the street some young man
[13:49] just in his young age when he's 17 18 20
[13:52] years old 25 30 walks around in there
[13:55] and this young lady comes twisting every
[13:57] form of body walking with a pair of high
[13:59] Shield shoes on her stuck all out in
[14:01] front and back and dresses that high
[14:03] above her knees or a pair of shorts
[14:05] on do you know the Bible said she'd act
[14:07] like that amen you know the Bible said
[14:09] that's the way she'd act
[14:11] amen how she'd be so filthy did you read
[14:15] this year this month's reader digest
[14:17] that man and women of this
[14:20] day little girls from 20 to 25 years old
[14:24] is in menopause that should go through
[14:26] the change of life in the middle age of
[14:28] life according to science between 20 and
[14:30] 25 it used to be around 30 to 35 in my
[14:33] age and my mother's age a woman never
[14:35] struck menopause so she's 40 or 45 what
[14:39] is it it's through
[14:42] sights and the
[14:44] food the
[14:46] hybrids that's perverted the whole human
[14:49] body to we become a bunch of
[14:52] of of a massive
[14:56] corruption well if the physical being is
[15:00] corrupted isn't the brain cell in that
[15:02] physical
[15:06] being now watch the spirit fallowing it
[15:10] and there'll come a time in the name of
[15:12] the Lord that people will go completely
