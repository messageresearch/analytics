TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when God made the world in six days when he went to rest he rested from then on drying that settled it he didn't come back on the eighth day and start again it was only a shadow now that was a type like the moon to the Sun but when the Sun comes up we don't need to move no more now notice this all in revelations 11 the woman with the moon under her feet in the Sun in her head oh we could go through the Bible he led the lady to show you see but what is it when the Bible said in Hebrews the fourth chapter if Jesus would have given them a rest day he would add words a spoke of it he would have spoke over their state what day did he speak about arrest come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest Matthew the eleventh chapter 22nd verse look then we find that when we come to him for he said Hebrews for that is entered into Jesus rest has ceased from his worldly works as God did from his when he made the world don't ever return to it again how how are

about the Bible all right let's go to Joelle find out what Joel said about it how thankful I am for the blessed word of God do you love it I think that if it wasn't for the word I don't know where we'd stand all right we're Joel now we're going to Joel the second chapter of Joel and we're going to start at the 28th verse Joel 2:28 800 years before the coming of Christ the prophet in the spirit now listen and it shall come to pass ad words that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon my servants and upon my hands Mabel I pour out in these days pour out in those days my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth blood fire and pillars of smoke the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come and it shall come to pass and whosoever shall call upon the name the Lord shall be delivered what Joel did you notice in acts 2 Peter tuck up the same verse said ye men of Israel hear my word these are not drunk this seal comforted my peculiar marked people they are not drunk as you suppose x2 seeing that this is a third hour of the day but this is that witches spoke up by Joel the Prophet saying it shall come to pass in the last days that I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh what is that what is the Holy Ghost all right now let's notice again promised to the believers that's what it is now this Holy Ghost we find out what it is just a minute who's that promised to to believers now let's go to Luke 24 chapter of Luke listen what Jesus said in his last words before he left the earth Luke the 24th chapter and you just taken this down down you can mark it down and study it tomorrow when you have more time now Luke 24:49 listen to Jesus speaking at the end when he was ascending up into glory the Ascension hears the words he said to his disciples behold I send the promise of my father what promise the seal the son the comforter and all these things that have spoke of times thousands more I send the promise of my father upon what promise the one that Isaiah said would come with stammering lips and other tongues I speak to these people I'll send that rest upon you our sin what George spoke of it it shall come to pass the last days saith god I'll pour out my spirit upon you oh I'll send to you and make all nations all people for getting from Jerusalem bringing the seed of Abraham under this covenant I'll see you away every one of them the I'll pour out my spirit I'll send the promise of my father upon you but tarry he means wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high what is the Holy Ghost and power from our house not power from the bishop not power from the church but power from on high how did that power come by Johnny Church I challenge you to say that's right but joining the church shaking hands with a preacher no sir now do you Catholic sticking out your tongue and taking the first communion no sir how did it come on hon that's three little party let's go to acts 1:8 they're swimming together now now they were speaking of Jesus here when they were cymbal together and it ordained another to take the Judas's place acts 1:8 but ye shall receive power after this the Holy Ghost is come upon you what you become the member of the bat Branham Tavern ain't no you become the member of the Methodist Church the Catholic Church your prayers for Gary not so in the Bible that's man-made

witnesses to me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the utmost parts of the earth which has never been reached yet and we have spoken these things when he spoke of these things while they beheld him he was taken up the proud and received out of their sight now turn not across the page what's these prophecies come to pass and when the day of Pentecost had fully come they were one they were all with one Accord in one place and all of a sudden the pastor came in and I got off the line there didn't all of a sudden the priests come on the altar and suddenly there came a sound not just to make believe it was there I found a minister was approaching the door the priest had the community coming out of the holy place there came a sound from heaven not to rustling of a feet there came a sound from heaven as a Russian mighty wind ho mah and it filled all the house where they were what is the Holy Ghost here's where they get power here's really supposed to wait here's what happened when they did it all prophesied from Genesis right on up from Abraham coming hot wood coming the results would come what is it promise to the church do you believers and filled all the house where there were set and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like a fire and is set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance now we go get on that Friday night we leave that right there how is it it's a promise to the church absolutely a promise all right now now we go to find out after they were filled they were sealed on till how long how many years got to Holy Ghost I see your hands there's more with the Holy Ghost of years without we want you to be one of us brother sister when you understand what it is if it is the Spirit of God dwelling in you to do the works of God when God ever sent any of his spirit into any of his servants any of these prophets any of these teachers any of these apostles they were always rejected of the world they were considered crazy and every age there was any when when Paul stood before Griffith he said in the way that's called heresy what is heresy crazy in the way that they call crazy a bunch of nuts that's the way I worship the God of our fathers I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them that's right I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them now I have to this Holy Ghost fell upon him it made them so much sweethearts until everything was in common is that right my mom what a fellowship we sing that song sometimes Oh what fellowship oh joy divine that's it they didn't care they didn't care whether they the sunshine or didn't they didn't ask for a flower better bees now I'll receive the Holy Ghost says some people to me mr. Branum if you will guarantee me that I'll be a millionaire if you'll guarantee me I'll find orwell's and if I'll find gold mines and I see people teach that and they teach a lie God has not promised those things a man who's ever receives the Holy Ghost don't pillory beg for bread or not let's make a difference to him he's a heaven bound creature [Music] you don't care let come let go what may let them criticize make fun who's your friend why do you care on your road to glory how do your your eyes are set on Christ and you're on your own you don't care what the world says that's what the Holy Ghost is it's a power it's a sealed it's a comforter it's an advocate it's a sign oh it's assurance that God has received you how much time Avanti I've got just eight more minutes all right I mean I got a lot of scriptures here I don't guess I can get him in but we'll try our best down after a man has been filled with the Holy Ghost is it possible that persecutions and things would cause him to have to come back in now he ain't gonna lose he's still a son of God he'll always be but cause you're sealed how long trying that's what the Bible did now as the disciples had been beaten they made fun of and everything they thought it's time to go back together a little while let's turn over that that Acts the fourth chapter and see one day what happened now this is to you people's already got it x2 fourth chapter now Peter and John had been beaten puttan prison for healing I haven't healing service that's engaged the church honey knows that there's mainly and they're kind of lame and he steamed and cooked wall been that way for 40 years and Peter passed you and he said how about he's got to get something put in these cups for food and Peter showed that he was a holy ghost still preacher he didn't have any money he said he said silver and gold have I known things he wasn't caring about that but he was a a heaven-bound creature oh how I wish we had time to lay in that little waffle Aerys II he was heaven bound he was comforting he had the spirit he had the power he walked on and said silver and gold have I none but such as I have I'll give to you no doubt the man said what you got sir I got failure I've got something in my heart it started about ten days ago I was in the upper room up there and all of a sudden all the promises that God had made I've walked with Jesus Christ for three and a half years I feast with him out pulling in the fish I've done these different things and I've seen heal the sick I he kept telling me the father's Envy but when I leave you're coming you so I couldn't understand that but he said I don't expect you to understand it you don't understand these things you just get them I don't understand it yet and don't tell me you do because you don't think God I can't understand and I can't explain it but one thing I know I got it was you say that's not scientifically oh sure it is look at that light when Benjamin Franklin caught it he said I got it he didn't know what he had but he had it and I want somebody tell me tonight what electricity is they don't know yet what it is but we got it that's right there's no man knows what lectricity is they can harness it make it like make it burn make it act but it's it's generated by generators to pieces running together like that it produces that and that's all they know it'll give life it's got power in it that's like the Spirit of God when you get one piece as you the other piece is God and get them run around together like that it'll do something for you it'll give light it'll give power you don't know what it is and you'll know what it is but you know only you got it that's one thing sure and it's fiery it's yours it says sure what's that light show there's assurance that is aligned now notice is you don't know what it is but these fella said well that they said one thing they know we know that they're injured more nuts you see like that those German said he was he that they're ignorant but they've been with that fisherman that carpenter call Jesus today because they're doing the same things he does that's what the Holy Ghost is is Jesus they need a great fisherman a cart endure or whatever injured preacher whatever it is it's a man that wants to be eager to the things of the world and I thought Jesus come into him the Spirit of God the seal the comforter you don't care about prestige all thing he wants his God when God was sitting in order he said all you Levites I've called you out made you priests and all your brothers whether twelve tribes and other 11 tribes or pay your tithing when you get a book nine bushel apples for one bushel to the Levites when you run your sheep do this they're all here pick up the ten sheep I don't care if it's a loon or a big one fat one or a poor one that belongs to the Levite i'll leave ice when you get all this then you've ties to to the Lord you make the wave offering he ball fries the different offerings you ties to the Lord said Moses for your part I am yours [Music] I'm your satisfying potion that's what the Holy Ghost is to the church today silvery gold have ocean education I can't want to read this book but I got a satisfying potion that's given doctor's degree I don't have any phd's realities or nothing else but there's one thing I have the satisfying potion that's the part I won't that's the part God wants you to have throw the rest of these old things away all the freshness and everything else and walk out and get God satisfying potion that's what you've got to this earth you leave here when you leave but if you've got that satisfying potion or take you out just this certainly we're always taking out insurance to play to give the Undertaker let's get God satisfying potion and get the up taker instead of the Undertaker you know they both work now the scene being let go they went to their own companies not back to the priests see that show they had it they wasn't going back that old cold formal thing again you know go back and said no looking at what they did that you know they had our own companies only about a dozen of them there but that was a company enough a little bitty a handful of people being let go after they beat him and threatened them if you ever baptized in Jesus name again or oh I'm in so well that's right see if you ever preached in Jesus name again whatever you do will get you let's go to the rest of brother all that's the way and unity there's power and unity is there's power hey let's go over to the rest of the Brethren and find out what we can do now they all come together was telling different experiences being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders have said unto them and when they had heard that they lifted up their voices to God with one Accord listen what they said watch him watch him not go back and say all something another about Oh Lord I'm so sorry I know you're already saved they were filled with the spirit they had eternal life lifted up their voice with one a car and said Lord dark God our God we know that which has made heavens and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David said I want you to come back see now we're on a now you go out there and say when I Lord not wait a minute here there just make so much fun of me didn't he say they'd do it all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution well you know my boss told me if he got didn't he say they'd say that well you know they've drawn me in a court the other day about it didn't he say you'd be brought before kings and rulers for money take no thought watch you say because it's not you that's speaking I've seen that happen yesterday it's the Holy Spirit that dwells in you he'll do the speaking that's trying all right take no thought watch you should say Lord but who buy our mouth of our servant David has said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ ah the truth Lord against our Holy Child Jesus thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel gathered together for to do whatsoever thou and and out council has determined therefore to be done hey I like that large are just doing the very thing that you said they do why the Bible send the last days Joe comes golfer's heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God whose makers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness but benign they didn't want to pray and receive power if this the Holy Ghost is come upon you having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away that's what the Holy Ghost is what is determined to be done now Lord behold they're threatening and they hunter thy servants that with all boldness we may speak thy word oh I like that get that old wishbone out and get a real backbone in there and now watch here we may speak that words by catching forth by hand to heal oh brother demons don't die but the Holy Ghost on easier touching forth on hand to heal that signs and wonders may be done by the name of the Holy Child Jesus you see what this fussing about don't you they're doing the same thing today but don't do a bit of good and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were a symbol together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and spake the Word of God with boldness they got something the promise said that's what the Holy Ghost is to give you bonus they gave you a comfort Cecelia give you a sound listen Oh wish we just had time we'd go down with Philip to the Samaritans and acts 8:14 the old cut them down they had received a great joy that had great healing but they had been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but they sent up to Jerusalem to get Peter he come down and laid hands on him and they receive the Holy Ghost Acts 8:14 the Gentiles there was one of the name of carnelian he was a wonderful man paid ty these built synagogues for the people respecting God feared God a good man good Presbyterian methodist bad dis or something nothing a very good man but one day God said he's a good man so I'm just gonna send him to your meeting I'll have to get my preacher over here tell him about it all right so he saw visions say go down to Joplin and find one down there named Simon Peter there's one Simon Peter next let he come up here he okay the way calls he's received something and while Peter stood up there Cornelius is go to worship that preacher he was Peter said stand up I'm a man like you are and while Peter yet spake these words of how they went back in the beginning it same things I'm talking about how God promised to pour toute the Holy Ghost while he spent seas the Holy Ghost fell oh man yeah that's what the Holy Ghost is whoo it's far sure and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost now notice in Ephesians that was a bad dispersed to law you're smart intelligent man know the law Briggs man a scholar one day got reading the Bible he's seen there would come one by the name of the Messiah and when he did that one he began to hear about this Jesus he said I'm convinced and I openly profess my faith that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God he was a real banker he come on I openly profess that Jesus is the Christ you got to do it it so much that God called him into ministry God will always speak to a true heart and there was a little tip maker down there banana Aquila and Priscilla a husband and wife David tentmakers Acts the 18th chapter tells you by Paul they were friends of his they had received the Holy Ghost or the hands of Paul in his teaching they heard there's revival there so they went over is only about ten or twelve painting it so he went over there to look at and he heard this preacher preaching the sincere he's already said you know I believe he'd listen to the truth so I asked his service or we call him out behind the tent and said look we got a little brother by so high a little hope knows you and but when he comes over here teaching the Word of God plainly well I sure while Paul was in jail at the same time awful face from modernistic preacher wasn't but he was in jail and Lord had him in there so absolute quick come shock to jail down he took to jail in his household and baptized them all in name the Lord Jesus alcohol come on over and it just cast a devil to have a little old girl down there telling the fortunes and then there's make a lot of money bar so he just expose their racket so then they put him in jail port Lord shook to jail now cause he had a bunch of people or hear the truth you can't buy in God's Word there's no matter what you in it you just can't do so he come over there to work this man wasn't a clue for Scylla maybe they had some sandwiches and right immediately to the sandwiches eat said were going with reliable Paulo set background Hill his little rollin listen this Baptist preacher preach that's fine what you preach let's see some more of them but I want to ask you a question doctor Apollo's have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe well he said we didn't know were there what do you mean by the Holy Ghost we're Baptists so how do you know you're bad to see well we was bad possibly only the baptism of John he said he only baptized unto repentance failure to be bond him to come that's on Jesus Christ and when he heard this they were baptized over in the name of Jesus Christ and Paul ladies hands upon them and the Holy Ghost came on a man they spoke in tongues and prophesied now now how do we do it I want to tell you something and I will close close it so I have told you I let you out early you don't want the Holy Ghost is for the last scripture far tonight I got another bunch down here but we'll have to omit that let's turn over to first Corinthians 12 and then we'll read this and then we all will close all right first corinthians the twelfth chapter how many breeds the teaching of st. paul sure he said in galatians 184 the angel called a zing different let him be accursed let alone a preacher if an angel from heaven come down taught anything different let him be cursed they don't have nothing to do with it now watch this first craziest 12 how how many knows that we have got to be in Christ an order to go on the reservation because it's his body that God promised to raise up in man there's no other way there's not another way if you're outside of Christ you might look back here and believe on me say sure I believe him he's a son of God good my brother I'm ready to shake your hand when you say that I believe on him I'll confess him as my savior that's good but you're still not easy I'll shake hands with the preacher I'll confess my sins that's still in now watch see what Paul said how you get in crime how you going to be noted as a circumcision Abraham they give a sign listen to this now first Corinthians twelfth chapter and let's begin at the twelfth first far as the body is one and has many members and all members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ not divided one listen followed by one church some he's reading behind by one handshake by one water Oh and somebody's wronged by one spirit into the capsule that's Holy Spirit by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit the body of Christ is one spirit or every member from penny cost of this time drinks of the same new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the same results how do we do it by one spirit if God opened doors or Holy Spirit what is it if God opened doors it's a sign if the senior is the comforter it's an advocate if the discern its rent if peace is goodness if healing is right it is God's open door to all these things if God opened or just Christ which has God through that he raised up Jesus from the dead and those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him at the resurrection grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are is it Christ on children they are your Redemption how many pleases what is Christ what is the Holy Ghost it's not something people laugh at it is some people like that but it ain't to the believer to the unbeliever I wish I had a long to the rear weeks I'd like to take tomorrow night and tell you what it is to the unbeliever let me just run through just a moment of time it's a laughingstock it's a snare it's a stumbling block it's death it's eternal separation from God I just can't think of the thing that it is to the unbeliever remember the same ring that the unbeliever made fun of was the same rain that saved Noah and his Saints the same spirit Holy Ghost that people are making fun of and says it's crazy and a bunch of nuts that's insanity it's the same thing that will rapture their church and take it up at the life phase will bring judgment upon the unbelievers that's what the Holy Ghost did blessed are they may I say this is a sincerity in my heart blessed are they that do hunger and thirst far far they shall be filled Maur night we're going to talk about how what it does when he comes now how many in here would like to receive the Holy Ghost and want somebody to pray for you that you see the light you know what it is now tomorrow night we're going to take what it does and then the next night is how to receive it then we're going to call in have people here instructed and go right into the rooms and stay there is it takes all through Christmas until the Holy Ghost comes we're going to approach it from a same Bible foundation we're going to approach it and get it just like God promised it and it fell at the beginning that's the way we're here to do it doesn't make a difference or anything we the Word of God is has preeminence in my heart and I want what God's got for me if he's anything more open heaven Lord's call about my heart's open card that's right how many wants it now raise your hand say pray for me now why do you remain with your hands up Heavenly Father we've taught a long time but your spirit is here there are hands it's up in the air now and they know what it is they know what the Holy Spirit needs I pray God that before this meeting shall end that every hand in here will be raised that they have received it granite Lord we pray for them we asked you to bless them and to give them the desire of their heart look at their hands Lord they love you they wanted they know they can't go tomorrow night if you'll help me Lord we could prove it in the scripture that they'll never make the rapture without it so our pray father that you'll give them hungering and thirsting so that they can be filled I'll present them to you now father and grant these blessings as we ask it in Jesus name Amen [Laughter] [Music] I want to say this before we sing again I want to meet with a bunch of Ministers in the room here riding nice before the service started the Friday night you see what I'm trying to do to show what it is how to approach it to watch you respect then you're not coming blind it's sitting into something that's reason over after tonight I want you to know what it is it's a promise it's a seal it's a comforter it's so forth then tomorrow night and the next night then we'll start right then from then on until it comes [Music]
