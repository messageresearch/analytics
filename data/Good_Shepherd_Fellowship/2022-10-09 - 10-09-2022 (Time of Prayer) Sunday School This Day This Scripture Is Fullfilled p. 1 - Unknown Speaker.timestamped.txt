[5:30] forever

[5:35] gathered out here in the time of this
[5:37] cold weather and

[5:44] that something extraordinary is going to
[5:47] be given us from God

[5:56] before last at the Tabernacle
[5:58] thank thee for the service here last
[6:01] evening and for the service today at the
[6:04] Tabernacle we're looking forward now
[6:06] what you will have for us tonight
[6:09] father we know that anyone that's able
[6:12] to move their hands could turn back the
[6:14] pages of the Bible but there is only one
[6:17] who can make it live be real and that's
[6:20] you father we're looking for you to do
[6:23] that tonight bless us in every way our
[6:25] hearts are so full of joy as we see the
[6:29] time approaching when we're going to
[6:31] meet him face to face
[6:33] the one that we've loved and live for
[6:36] all these years
[6:37] many new converts Lord has been made
[6:40] understanding that a great hosts 40 or
[6:43] 50 is to be baptized in your name in the
[6:46] morning
[6:47] from the service last night
[6:49] oh God please continue we pray until
[6:53] every predestinated seat of God has seen
[6:56] the Gospel Light and come into the full
[7:00] we ask you to hide us tonight behind the
[7:03] word blind us to the things of the world
[7:05] and let us see Jesus May there be a
[7:09] mount Transfiguration experience among
[7:11] us tonight that we see no man save Jesus
[7:14] only
[7:15] we ask that in his name and for his
[7:18] glory and a Vindication of his gospel
[7:21] amen
[7:23] you'll be seated
[7:28] I'm just going to turn this mic or this
[7:30] desk just slightly sideways if it's all
[7:33] right
[7:34] so that I can see both sides of the
[7:36] audience
[7:37] I guess I can get these microphones
[7:40] around here right
[7:42] all right Justin
[7:48] we are greeting from the main Auditorium
[7:51] here tonight our friends
[7:52] and Arizona
[7:54] California Texas and across the United
[7:58] States by the way of telephone this is
[8:00] going Nationwide this service tonight by
[8:04] the way off telephone
[8:06] so we trust that God will bless us can
[8:09] you hear back over to the auditorium to
[8:11] the left
[8:14] all right they're going to check now the
[8:16] telephone system to see if it's working
[8:17] all right everybody happy tonight that's
[8:22] fine on this side amen I'm so glad to
[8:25] see that you're all seated comfortably
[8:27] and now tomorrow night if the crowds
[8:32] keep increasing they'll also be
[8:33] telephone direct there is tonight I
[8:35] think some of them is down there at the
[8:37] Tabernacle and tomorrow morning the
[8:40] services cannot be had at the Tabernacle
[8:43] because the it'll be a force there a
[8:46] decorating the church for a wedding
[8:49] tomorrow afternoon and they have
[8:53] transferred the the services in the
[8:55] morning up to brother ruddle's church
[8:58] one of our Associates and up on the the
[9:02] highway here 62 I haven't been announced
[9:05] it's been announced if it overflows up
[9:07] there we'll take the rest and send
[9:10] another Minister down to brother Junior
[9:12] Jackson's down in Clarksville the reason
[9:14] we had it brother ruddles it's close
[9:16] here and we can um and we thought you
[9:20] could find that easier and then we'll
[9:22] take care of it in some way and be sure
[9:25] to get all those baptisms in Puerto
[9:27] tomorrow and I hope there'll be another
[9:29] hundred or two added to those for
[9:31] baptism tomorrow
[9:33] and now
[9:35] tomorrow night I never like to announce
[9:38] anything you speak on ahead of time but
[9:40] one night in the service or one day I
[9:44] want to speak on the subject of who is
[9:46] this Melchizedek because it's a subject
[9:50] that I think we're living in the time
[9:51] when these Revelations of which has been
[9:54] the question down through the age of who
[9:57] is this fella and I believe that God has
[10:00] the answer who he was some said a
[10:02] priesthood some said a king some but
[10:04] there's got as long as a question
[10:06] there's got to be an answer to that
[10:08] question which is right cannot be a
[10:11] question without first being unanswered
[10:14] now
[10:16] we trusting that God will give us a
[10:19] blessing tonight out of his word as we
[10:22] read it and you've had Billy told me to
[10:24] tell you that you sure had fine
[10:26] cooperation with the peoples here that's
[10:29] been in the parking system the police
[10:31] and everything
[10:33] keep it up that's very very good we hope
[10:36] to see the time maybe in the near future
[10:38] when maybe we could bring the tent here
[10:41] to the city and put it up out here in
[10:43] the ballpark where we can stay for some
[10:46] length of time maybe for three or four
[10:48] weeks Revival constantly here we just
[10:52] merely get to know each other and then
[10:54] we have to
[10:56] um
[10:57] say goodbye and we go again
[11:01] but I'd like to come and stay an
[11:03] extensive trip one time where you can
[11:05] stay so we don't have to close out a
[11:08] night or two but just stay and teach day
[11:10] and night day and night on and on maybe
[11:13] somebody go home and feed the chickens
[11:16] milk the cows and come back next week
[11:17] and continue home with the service
[11:20] I like that so
[11:22] the Lord be with you now before I leave
[11:27] perhaps Sunday morning or Sunday night
[11:29] or sometime one of these Services I know
[11:32] you're all waiting to hear the message
[11:34] on the truth about marriage and divorce
[11:38] which is one of the great problems of
[11:39] the day
[11:41] just as sure as I'm standing here I
[11:43] believe that the correct answer is in
[11:46] the word of God
[11:48] and I believe that that's what I promise
[11:50] to come back for and I suppose knowingly
[11:53] as far as I know I want to have another
[11:56] service here and Jeffersonville on
[11:58] Easter Sunday and we'll for Sunrise
[12:01] Service and then Easter Sunday so we'll
[12:03] announce it ahead and try maybe to get
[12:05] the auditorium if possible or somewhere
[12:07] as far as Sunday May become Saturday and
[12:10] Sunday had to fly in and back out
[12:12] because it's near the time I have to
[12:14] check it first with the schedule I have
[12:18] and one of my my itinerary
[12:22] in California and then immediately I've
[12:25] got to go down into Africa so um
[12:29] keep in touch and pray for us
[12:31] now tonight
[12:34] I want to call your attention to a
[12:37] potion of God's word found in the fourth
[12:41] chapter of Saint Luke
[12:44] the fourth chapter and the 16th verse it
[12:48] will begin Jesus speaking this day is
[12:51] this word fulfilled in your ears now
[12:57] we want to draw from that uh conclusion
[13:03] of Howard Dynamics
[13:06] is the word of God
[13:09] God now we all can figure out the
[13:11] mechanics
[13:13] but it takes the Dynamics to make it
[13:17] work
[13:18] we can figure out
[13:20] what the mechanics of a machine
[13:23] automobile but then it takes
[13:26] the Dynamics to make the wheels go to
[13:30] operating and moving now Jesus had
[13:34] returned to to Nazareth where he was
[13:38] brought up
[13:39] on down in the scripture share we find
[13:41] that they said we ain't heard you did
[13:44] such and such over Capernaum
[13:47] now let us see you do it here in your
[13:50] own country Jesus said a prophet is not
[13:54] without honor except in his own country
[13:57] and of course that's where you're
[13:59] brought up at and where people know you
[14:01] and there he had a a bad name to begin
[14:05] with by him being born without an
[14:09] Earthly father they called him an
[14:11] illegitimate child that Mary was
[14:14] actually pregnant before she married
[14:18] officially Joseph but that isn't so we
[14:21] know it isn't so and
[14:24] on this scripture what caused me to fall
[14:28] My Eyes Upon This was
[14:31] uh something had happened just recently
[14:34] in Phoenix Arizona
[14:36] it was the last day of the service that
[14:40] I was to speak at the International
[14:41] Convention of the Full Gospel
[14:43] businessman and in this convention
[14:47] there was a visitor with us which was uh
[14:52] Catholic bishop
[14:54] which is uh is uh of the child eating
[14:58] rights
[14:59] all the apostolic Catholic Church the
[15:03] most Reverend John S Stanley OSD
[15:08] um
[15:09] he is the Archbishop of Metropolitan
[15:12] United States
[15:13] in the Catholic church this had to be
[15:16] his card and his and
[15:19] his address and he was a visitor
[15:24] uh with the Christian businessman
[15:27] and I had seen there the day before and
[15:30] when I was speaking on Saturday night I
[15:33] believe it was or Saturday morning at
[15:35] the breakfast
[15:37] and I as I was speaking he uh kept
[15:42] watching me I thought that man certainly
[15:45] is disagreeing with everything I say
[15:48] and uh you know you get you could just
[15:51] see me keep his head up and down but I
[15:53] didn't know what was just exactly
[15:55] working on him so on Sunday afternoon
[15:57] when I got up to speak
[16:01] I was going to take my text on birth
[16:04] pains where Jesus said that as a woman
[16:08] Intervale with a child
[16:11] she's travailing in birth
[16:14] and uh so I was going to speak from
[16:18] there as birth pains the subjects saying
[16:21] that the world is in birth pains now
[16:25] although old has to be done away with so
[16:28] the new can be born just like a seed has
[16:31] to rot away in order to give New Life
[16:34] how the pains birth pains struck
[16:38] um the world in World War One
[16:42] she had a terrific pain
[16:45] because he had poisoned gas and so forth
[16:47] that almost could destroy the world
[16:50] and in World War II she struck another
[16:53] harder pain it had Blockbusters and also
[16:57] an atomic bomb
[16:59] she cannot stand another labor pain with
[17:03] these missiles and things today one more
[17:05] war will throw out into space for she
[17:09] will now be delivered and there will be
[17:11] a new Earth the Bible said there will be
[17:15] honor ever prophet's message Israel God
[17:18] of birth pain
[17:20] because these prophets have come on the
[17:22] scene after the theologians and
[17:24] clergymen would have the church all in
[17:26] an organization form and when that
[17:28] prophets come on the scene with thus
[17:30] saith the Lord they shut down churches
[17:32] and she had a birth painting finally she
[17:35] had birth planes flown up until she
[17:37] delivered a son of the Gospel which was
[17:40] the word itself made flesh
[17:43] so the church really is in birth pains
[17:46] tonight again for the Deliverance of the
[17:50] son son of God to come again all of our
[17:53] theologians all of our systems all of
[17:55] our denominations have rotted right out
[17:57] from under us so we are in birthing
[18:00] and a message from God always towards
[18:03] the church and have your pain but after
[18:05] a while she's going to be delivered of a
[18:07] bride
[18:08] that'll bring forth Jesus Christ to his
[18:11] bride
[18:12] and then thanking this man to disagree
[18:15] with me so much
[18:16] when I raised up to speak this message
[18:20] uh turned in my Bible to find the page
[18:23] and my wife had just given me a new
[18:25] Bible for Christmas my old Bible is
[18:27] about 15 years old and the thing was
[18:30] just about Torn to Pieces the pages
[18:32] every time would open up and fly out of
[18:34] it and but I know just where to find
[18:36] every scripture so I study closed in
[18:41] that Bible and I just picked up the new
[18:43] one because the other looks a ragged to
[18:44] go to church with and when I started to
[18:47] turn over in Saint John where the
[18:49] scripture was found I started to read
[18:52] the 16th chapter and the verse that I
[18:55] was looking for wasn't there
[18:59] so I thought strange I turned back again
[19:02] still it wasn't there and brother Jack
[19:06] Moore from Shreveport Louisiana bosom
[19:08] friend of mine he was sitting there I
[19:10] said brother jack isn't that found in
[19:13] Saint John 16 he said yes
[19:15] and this Catholic priest got up out of
[19:18] his seat from about a hundred clergymen
[19:21] sitting on the platform walked over
[19:23] close to me with all of his robes and
[19:25] gowns and crosses and so forth and got
[19:28] right up close to me and he said my son
[19:30] Be steady
[19:33] God is fixing to move
[19:36] I thought a Catholic bishop telling me
[19:38] that he said read it out of my book
[19:41] and I read the scripture out of his book
[19:44] and talk by text and went over
[19:47] preach my sermon afterwards when I got
[19:50] through he got up after I was gone and
[19:52] said this one thing has to happen after
[19:54] that the church has to get out of the
[19:57] mess it sits in or we have to get out of
[19:59] the mess the churches so one of the
[20:01] other and uh I was on my road home back
[20:04] down to Tucson that evening the kids was
[20:07] crying for a sandwich and I stopped to
[20:10] get a sandwich a little standing my wife
[20:12] said
[20:13] bill I never was so nervous in all my
[20:17] life to see you stand up there Plumbing
[20:19] to that Bible said didn't it make you
[20:21] nervous I said no I said I know it was
[20:23] in there somewhere they just didn't have
[20:25] the pages of misprint and she said to
[20:27] think that I got you that Bible and
[20:29] looked like every eye in there was right
[20:30] up on me and I said well you couldn't
[20:33] help that there's a misprint in the
[20:34] Bible I said they just never put the
[20:36] page in well I got out and looked at it
[20:39] again just perfect see if it could be
[20:40] but the 16th chapter ends potion the
[20:43] portion of it it's about three inches
[20:45] from the bottom over at the 70th chapter
[20:48] on the other side does the same thing
[20:50] and being a new Bible those two pages
[20:52] had perfectly stuck together and I was
[20:55] reading from the 17th chapter instead of
[20:57] the 16. well I said that's all fine it's
[21:01] for some cause and just as plain as you
[21:05] could hear any voice
[21:07] a voice come to me and said he entered
[21:10] into Nazareth the word he was brought up
[21:13] at
[21:14] and went into the synagogue as it was
[21:17] his custom
[21:19] and the priest gave him the scriptures
[21:23] to read and he read Isaiah 61 and when
[21:29] he had read the scriptures he sat down
[21:32] handed the priests back to the Bible the
[21:35] book
[21:36] and sat down in all the eyes of the
[21:40] congregation was upon him and precious
[21:43] words proceeded from his mouth and he
[21:45] said this day this scripture is
[21:48] fulfilled
[21:50] this day this scripture is fulfilled how
[21:55] good is the scripture
[21:58] if you'll notice this
[22:00] in Isaiah 61 1-2
[22:03] is where our Lord was reading from
[22:07] Isaiah 61 1-2 but in the middle of the
[22:11] second verse of Isaiah 61 he stopped or
[22:15] said the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[22:17] to preach the acceptable year then he
[22:22] stopped why
[22:23] the other part to bring judgment that
[22:26] didn't apply to his first coming but is
[22:28] Second Coming
[22:30] did the father how the scriptures never
[22:33] make a mistake
[22:35] they're always perfect
[22:38] Jesus stopped just where the scripture
[22:41] stopped because that was exactly what
[22:43] was to be Vindicated in his day
[22:47] now is that first coming the second
[22:50] coming he will bring judgment upon the
[22:52] Earth but not then he was to preach the
[22:55] acceptable year notice the Messiah
[22:59] standing in the platform to identify
[23:02] himself with the Word of Promise for
[23:05] that age
[23:07] how strange amen
[23:10] the Messiah standing up
[23:13] before the church
[23:15] and look at these precious words when he
[23:18] says here to preach the acceptable year
[23:22] the acceptable year as we all know as
[23:25] Bible readers was a Year of Jubilee
[23:27] that when all slaves and prisoners as
[23:31] they were uh been taken prison
[23:35] and I had to give a son to pay a debt
[23:38] our daughter to pay a debt
[23:41] and they were in bondage no matter how
[23:45] long they'd been in bondage or how long
[23:46] they're supposed to stay there when the
[23:49] year come of the Jubilee when the
[23:51] trumpet sounded every man could go free
[23:55] if he wanted to go free
[23:57] they're free you are no more slave
[24:00] but if you desired to remain a slave
[24:03] then you had to be taken down to the
[24:07] temple stood by the temple post and it
[24:10] took a awe and board a hole in your ear
[24:13] and then you had to serve that slave
[24:17] master the rest of your days
[24:20] what a perfect example it is of the
[24:23] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[24:25] when it's preached the acceptable time
[24:29] and the time of Jubilee anybody no
[24:32] matter who you are what color you are
[24:35] what denomination you belong to how it's
[24:38] far you stooped in sin or what's wrong
[24:41] with you you can't go free when you hear
[24:44] the dry gospel trumpet sound out
[24:47] you are free but if you turn your back
[24:52] upon the message
[24:55] and refuse to hear it notice you were
[24:58] born in the ear with an awe that means
[25:03] to say that you have crossed the line
[25:06] between grace and judgment and you will
[25:10] never hear the gospel again
[25:13] you'll never get any further you must be
[25:15] a slave do the system you're in the rest
[25:18] of your days
[25:20] if you refuse to hear the acceptable
[25:23] year
[25:25] now
[25:26] the other part of it is I said didn't
[25:28] need to be answered because this coming
[25:31] Messiah time now is when he will bring
[25:34] judgment now how could those people ever
[25:39] fail to see who he was
[25:44] how did they ever miss it
[25:47] how could it be when it was so plainly
[25:50] made known and showed
[25:53] how could they have ever missed seeing
[25:56] one what a word think of it this day is
[26:02] this scripture fulfilled before
