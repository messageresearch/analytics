prayer i ask in the precious name of jesus christ a redeemer and savior amen anyways i just want to give a little just a little testimony and preview of my brother we known each other now we have known each other now for over 30 years i when i first came to minnesota i used to travel i didn't know him very well but after a while we got to know each other and get around with each other he was a precious brother he still is he might not be healed here in this in the body form but he's here in the spirit i know he's here we used to joke around and tease each other and just worship get together with coffee and so many times we just enjoy just fellowship the fellowship with one another we talked about our youth we talked about our families we talked about our struggles and we talked about our lord jesus christ there was something about him that he was just such a loving brother he loved people he he just enjoy being around people just fellowshipping and talking to people and i know that he might be the party but i know that we will see him again it's a promise as the song has said we would be in that land and we would be with him i i just had a little scripture that came to me out of psalms also and i want to read it it just just just short just short forgive me brother it it psalms 65 and verse 4 blessed is the man who thou chooses and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts and i believe he's there he's enjoying he's seeing all the brothers and sisters he's shaking hands i know that those brothers are just greeting him and just seeing him i know that it's in my heart i know that we had coffee here about two saturdays ago and we were just enjoying and talking about our youth and friends that we had and bygone and remembering those who have gone to be in glory like brother david brother john lafontaine brother words brother john ordo all of these brothers are there to meet him and to be with him but he will never leave my heart you will always be in my heart he was precious to me he taught me a lot of things and used if we just say but the one when i get all a little bit out of hand he would just come and just say brother one and i just thankful to the lord that we had him for this time now for him time is no more he's eternal and i'm sure that he wants us to just get closer to one another in our hearts in the love of christ he wants us to just get closer to one another so i have a little song that we used to sing and i'm gonna sing this song for the glory of the lord and in memory of my brother scott i i don't want to say no more because i if i start crying nobody's going to stop me so i just want to sing that song it's um i will meet you in the morning i will meet you in the morning i will meet you little higher brother i

we know what what the program will be this coming wednesday we will have a prayer meeting like we normally do and we will also uh open for for people that would like to things that would like to give tributes and uh because depending on what the program of the the family would be that is just exactly what we would respect so i believe that uh there might not be a lot of rooms for personal and individual tributes so we can do that here in church so beginning wednesday night and sunday coming if you is laid on you how to give a tribute uh in remembrance of brother's cat you are welcome just write it give it to the deacons and then we will we will have time for for that so that's what we want to we want to uh share with you this morning so let's just stand on our feet and uh as i'm always

one of us let's just read this uh this uh scripture few verses here we will read from verse one to seven then the lord answered job out of the whale wind and said who is this that darkened counsel by words without knowledge gail up now that limbs like a man for i will demand of thee and answer doubt me where will that when i lay the foundation of the earth declared if thou has understanding who have laid the measures there of measurement if thou knoweth will have laid will have stretched the line upon it speaks about boundaries word upon are the foundations there are fasting or who lay the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sung together and all the sons of god shouted for joy praise the lord let's drop down to verse 17 in the same chapter god asking job all of these different questions verse 17 have the gates of death been opened on today or have thou seen the doors of the shadow of death let us pray heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus we take a portion of these scriptures that we have just read we read a psalm earlier oh god father that announced you entering the gifts of death and precious lord yeah father god you asking job if he have ever went through the gates of death father we just prayed that you would bless the future that is on our hearts this morning as we encourage your people father lord getting once again we will ask our lord father for special strength for our sister sister naomi lord gab for the uh sister grace sister esther the husband the children father we prayed for brother stephen his wife and the children lord gal we remember father lord god brother lord lord and sister faith lord and uh and brother jordan the entire family lord and the family at large almighty god we pray for brother scat mama we commit her into your

you the glory and honor as we commit ourself in your hands bless us now in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seed you may have your seat and we we want to come this way i believe there there are many beyond our our assembly that are streaming in or that will stream in later because uh many will like to to know what the program will be and just like i said as soon as we hear from the family we will let everybody know those that are way out of state and those that are connected with us we will let each and every one of you know as for yet the family are still deciding what they would do in regards to laying the remains of our brother but as as a church just like i said repeat again wednesday night we will have a prayer meeting we want to open for those that might have a tribute in remembrance of brother scat sunday we will do the same and and i believe maybe by that time we will have more information to bring to you of what we would do and uh but uh we all know that uh i mean it was about last sunday monday that we you know we all heard that brother scale was not feeling well uh sunday he and sister naomi never came sister naomi texted me that they would not be in service uh and they were going to get tested because we realized a few of the sins in church started being sick and some came down with the coronavirus so we kept the kids home and some families stay home and those that were sick was staying home to recover and all of that so uh on monday uh then we we also heard that her brother scared in cisnamin came down with the coronavirus but there there was i mean brother scott had a fever and sister naomi was doing her best to to take care of him and then i think i spoke with i spoke with both of them on on monday and tuesday but scared blood sugar was dropping and sister naomi had to rush him to the hospital called the ambulance or the paramedic to get him over to the hospital and then destabilize him he was doing okay and on wednesday he was back home to his house and the last conversation i had with him he was uh we were just talking when he received a phone call and and he was trying to set up to go and get his antibody shots and that was a word he he drove to uh he and his wife that friday to get the shot and uh he went in to get the shot while sister naomi was waiting for him just in that period of time then he had a cardiac arrest and and they quickly came to cause a tsunami got in on the ambulance and uh and rushing to the hospital to the region hospital so right in between uh the time he got the cardiac arrest or to the hospital we got a text from my brother jordan right after brother lloyd called me we were on the phone and uh for the wiring and then we we then he called me back later on uh there was just now i mean we prayed together and so right in between there i think i got a text message that they got a reading of his heart on the way to the hospital but then when he got to the hospital then his heart stopped so i believe it was right there the angels pack our brother he crossed the curtain of time praise the lord but uh just like brother juan said we will miss brother's cat i mean he was special i will i will bring my tribute to brother scott and but this morning i just want to encourage other you know thinking about everything and just seeing where we are i mean we can just only talk about the promises of god beyond this life amen so this morning just for the little encouragement to the church and to all that might be following the service we just want to speak about oh death is just an open door oh death it's just an open door praise the lord that's what i want to speak on this morning uh just i will just read a few quotes from the prophet but i believe that god has given us as an assembly an opportunity uh to begin to look upward because one that was with us has just gone home so it's an opportunity whenever death comes to us this way and most especially when one of the sin has since have gone home it's an opportunity for us for the family to begin to look upward praise the lord and [Music] it's almost like when the child gets out of high school you know the family starts to look for job and starts to look around us look for job you know when when the child is uh is about to get married we start to look for where place to live whether we might have to move to oregon or we have to move to alaska where we start to look around us we start to look around us and that is the same way when death comes to the believers it's an opportunity for us to begin to look upward because one has just left us not that uh and then not actually walking with our heads looking up because we know it's a dimension it's just that our heart begins to look upwards begins to look unto the lord and uh uh so uh with that with that being said uh you know we we we just take the few thoughts here uh reading from psalm psalm chapter 24 you know uh david the psalmist there gave a a prophecy and and we know that their prophecy was about our lord jesus but when you look at the psalm there closely you will see the other let me get a psalm chapter 24. god itself when we look in the same year and reading from verse six this is the generation of them that seek him they are sick that face old jacob seller lift up your hairs all he gets and be lifted up ye everlasting doors now uh thinking about this this morning that death is just an open door uh that lead us from this side you know right into the presence of god i i i taught that i taught about this psalm this morning and to just see how the summit year on the inspiration you know is uh is is prophesying you know about jesus going through the gates he going through the doors and going through the gates of death we know that you know uh brother branham tied this to jesus after he died on the cross he went down to the region of the lost to take the keys of death and hell from the devil amen and also to open the gates and transfer paradise over to the sixth dimension praise the lord so we realized that it's under this honor this time we see the prophecy of what took place at that moment when jesus gave up the gospel praise the lord so there was there were just there was there is no dull movement with the believer there is not a time that that the believer uh uh or the saint of god ever go into a doorstep no praise the lord and as we will see that and and as we we would just encourage ourselves this morning we'll realize that death just like we said all death uh uh is it's a git it's a door that you just step in you know you just step in and as you step into it you drop this body down and you go on in into other activities praise the lord amen you move right into other activities for the uh many christians and many believers have always wondered what happened after this life but we know that uh god in his mercy has been able to give us you know some witness amen he had been able to give us some witness uh uh by allowing brother branham to go beyond the curtain of time and to come back and tell us that there is a land beyond the river amen there's a land beyond the river and uh uh this is now all to life there is a there's a place that is more real than what we have here praise the lord and that's what we are we are living for that's what we are you know uh looking forward to so we believe that uh uh brothers brother scott stepped through those doors and uh and i mean it is just it's just completely different brother branham said here listening to the message things that are to be he said now he's talking about jesus he just read the scripture saint john uh 14. i go to prepare the place for you so he comes here he says now he said when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose praise the lord jesus therefore is telling his disciple that this life is not ended in death amen amen amen he said when you see my life ending it's ending for the purpose praise the lord and even uh uh you know even to us as a church just like i said it has given us an opportunity to begin to to look beyond the curtain of time and uh and even to the family you know to our dear sister to the children you know better scared life and for the purpose and it will it would take almighty god to gradually help us to be able to embrace that purpose praise the lord and and and we know that all of god's purpose in his mind is to bring us to a better end amen whatever god purpose in his mind is to bring the best out of us he's the great fisherman you know i was just talking about uh fishing the last time and i got to that uh true they are taught here but god is the great fisherman he knows how to fish the best out of you amen he knows how to fish he knows how to draw you more closer to him so we see here that uh uh brother branham said jesus said when you see my life aiming it's in for the purpose therefore jesus is telling his disciple that his life that this life is not ended in death praise the lord no he says remember we death set right before us praise the lord death set right before us that was what i was reading i was listening to last night and and i just i just i just came up with uh with that talk the inspiration just struck me all death is an open door it's just an open door praise the lord as we are sitting right here in this building death is sitting right before us as we as you drive your vehicle as we live our life we have that open door that we can step in any moment that's why we have to live a life worthy of the gospel because death sits right before us and he says and and we don't know whether there may be some in this building tonight will not go out of here alive in this physical life that's how uncertain it is praise the lord amen is uncertain to our human reasoning but to the soul of a believer is setting what makes a setting is because our faith tells us that when we go through that door we will be standing before our maker amen hallelujah yes praise the lord or we don't know whether there is some in this building tonight will not go out of here alive in this physical life amen now you think about that he he he has to kind of make it you will not go alive in this physical life because it's it's still the same thought that uh even if you you you die you are still living you are not just in this physical body but your life goes on there is just no door moving you are just dropping this clothes off and you step into another body and you continue on amen praise the lord the only the only thing you have to do is is come to some awareness you start to look around you oh my oh my praise the lord there is no dull moment for for the for for the sins he says that that's how uncertain it is five minutes from now it could be that young healthy young people in this building can be a cops in five minutes from there that is true and again it could be in five minutes from now we did everyone be in glory [Music] praise the lord amen we just don't know amen all death is just an open door over in hebrew chapter 2 series and if this athlete tabernacle be dissolved to know that there's dosing of people sitting here that if if they should leave this life right now before we could get their body to the undertaker they will be in a glorious body amen amen praise the lord no door woman that's the hope we hold within us praise the lord hallelujah to know that a dozen of people sitting here that if they should leave this life right now before we could get their body to the undertaker they will be in that glorious body younger rejoicing with the saints of god already in the presence of god to live forever wave the perfect and brother branham says absolutely vindication that is sold now the reason why he's saying absolutely vindication that is so is because of the the experience behind the curtain of time praise the lord amen oh what a hope we have in us praise the lord amen you know it's it's it's just like uh you know uh uh even the apostle paul he when he preached the rapture message he said we that are alive you know he says we that are alive so he did not preach the rapture message for you he preached the rapture message for himself he was expecting to be the one that would partake of the rapture he was looking forward to experience the change of the body praise the lord and brother branham says all the saints have held that in their heart praise the lord everyone that have had an experience of a new birth and the holy ghost living in their heart never put the rapture to the future the rapture becomes a personal possession praise the lord the rapture becomes a person of possession you you're not looking for your children to go in the rapture you're looking for yourself to go in the rapture with your children praise the lord but you see the thing there is that uh uh uh you know we talk about the rapture in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you know we we we will be changed and and and and we we hold that hope in our heart we want to experience that you know just like in a walk with god and he was not praise the lord we want to experience what that translation is praise the lord a man just like elijah you know on the banks of jordan throwing down his his metal down and and then and in the twinkling of an eye he was gone and all that elisha could see was a chariot of fire going through the sky amen we want to experience that praise the lord but let me tell you something also you say god is not posture praise the lord god is a god that is so fed in all that he does praise the lord now whether you you go by the translation like elijah and enoch and all of those men or whether you go by the way of death in this life the truth about the matter there is that let me let me come back again and he says it says there was there was only one man that tasted both our lord jesus went through the parties of death and he also ascended on him praise the lord and and god being so gracious and a god that is so equal and just in the things that he does is that as you desire to to experience the translation and go up like elijah and uh and and then they have gone through the portals through the doors of death there is an experience that the one that go through the door of death will have that you will not have if you have the body change that's true that is true praise the lord and the thing about it there is that both of them are glorious both of them are the same amen praise the lord because this corruption connect this corruptable body cannot inherit incorruptible so just in the twinkling of an eye you will have to throw this body up somewhere to be able to take out a new one just in that moment and that is the same thing that happened to the man or the woman that goes through the doors of death praise the lord so nobody have advantage over their friend [Laughter] amen praise the lord no one has advantage over their friend because for this for this person take example like like brother scat there was not a second word he was he was uh in a dull moment i don't know where he was as women as he birthed his last breath here he was already gone from the body amen he was gone from the body in consciousness looking at his body lying right there and he was going from the body you see that is the reason why the the believer the saints uh uh uh uh whether in death or in life yes yes we still glorify god amen but brethren says before they get to the undertaker they will be in a glorified body jana rejoicing with the saints praise the lord so whether it is in an accident or whether it is in i mean out of these scenes that that they had to die and and and they had to chop them with the sword or they have to put a spear through them it's just in the moment of a twinkling of an eye they sing out of their body praise the lord they swore don't even touch them before their acts reach down on their neck they have already got out of the body and you can do whatever you want to do with it that's the mystery that behind the curtain of time brought to us god kept that end time mystery because we know paul speaks in the book of timothy how immortality has always dwelt with us [Music] but the understanding we did not know praise the lord amen and we know how the how the prophet was always thinking about that let's read something yet again praise the lord amen amen lord show us the father and he will suffice us he says i want to live right that when that when that day comes why i know there's a great dark chamber sitting yandere in the front of me like there is in everyone else every time your heart beats you are one bit closer to that chamber that's the gate that's the door praise the lord you are one you are one be closer to that chamber it's called death and every one of us are heading that way amen amen praise the lord it's not behind you it's a door that is always before you that is right brother praise the lord you turn this way it's before you yes it is you turn this way it's before you we are all heading that way praise the lord oh what a blessed assurance amen that we hold in our heart to know that jesus is mine amen yes lord thank you thank you dear god the faith that was once delivered to the saints jesus he says god gave me the holy ghost to escape everything even everything until even death can hurt me [Music] amen that's that's the reason why we don't want to limit the holy ghost to to a church membership you know we don't want to limit the holy ghost to uh uh to some kind of a sensation you have to know that you have the holy ghost and that holy ghost in your life will separate you from sin it will destroy the desire of sin in the memories of your body it's going to take the will it will take the will power you will be tempted you will be blasted from every way but you don't have the will to walk into sin because that is your escape that's your ticket that's your talking to escape that even death do not hurt praise the lord death do not hurt amen it only hurt us that are on this side we are caught up with emotion we are in the body that i do feel but those that goes through the portal of death with the holy ghost death do not hurt praise the lord thank you lord death do not hurt praise the lord oh what an opportunity for us as a church to begin to look upwards to know that heaven is real one of us have just stepped on the show yes amen praise the lord you know friday night i was thinking about everything before i won down to bed i went back and uh i i was watching that testimony that brother scat gave uh if you you want to find it you can go back it's uh february 2nd 2020 uh so it's uh 0202 2020. yeah they did make it easy for me to remember and where he testified about you know coming back from brother david wright finra and uh and then just after that after he got back then brother john lafontaine also passed away you know and he was thinking about all of that and says you know he gave a testimony on whom he came to me in the office and then he was just telling me you know how the law was dealing with him on his way back and and he was just i mean he was just pouring out his heart and just crying so i said okay brother scat just bring us a testimony amen just testified to us and it was such a blessing so i was just listening to that on friday night and and [Music] you see the thing about it there is that as i was as i was watching the testimony you know it was it was very difficult to connect brother scott with death it was so difficult to connect him with death because i'm i'm looking at him there testifying you know praise the lord the only thing i was not seeing was his new body you know the only time the only thing i couldn't see was his new body you know you know i was just i was just lying on the bed and i was just laughing you know he before he started you talk about how uncomfortable he was in his coat he took his coat off and threw it down and how uncomfortable he was in his necktie and took his neck out of and throw it down and i was just laughing praise the lord like the south african would say he was a cut of his kind you cannot impersonate brother's cat you know and because he did not impersonate he was just the way he he was you know praise the lord amen brother branham share this i'm listening to this also the resurrection of the lord jesus he said this and and i couldn't help but think about brother's cat we will read this and we find a place to close here praise the lord amen we we love our brother yes he did appreciate him brother branham said he says and you know we will be entertained by all the great singers there will be senke you remember senki that told us testimony about sinking he was the one that uh that became the song leader for dior moody the one that their snapper was about to shoot that night and he heard senki singing so brother branham says we will be entertained by all the great singers there will be saint uh sinking there will be beverly shells and all of them and then you can put brother scout right in the heart of them praise the lord over on the hills over there just singing the praises of god we will be sitting down by the tree of life where the waters are coming out from under the throne won't that be marvelous are just long for that day what does it matter to a christian that is really uncle in christ for just as soon as this athlete tabernacle is taken away we move right into another one right up there we move right into it praise the lord i mean whether the person died at home or they died in an accident on the streets or wherever they die they step right out of that body into a new body mind isn't that marvelous think sick wear it broken down heartbroken everything going wrong the word all in a tumblr you think well come lord jesus the first thing you know this all shaky body begins to weather the weight and you feel the pains moving through it the chili depths moving up the sleeves then looks stenny under yander a brand new body praise the lord let's get into uh uh let's let's let's try to envision what brother branham is saying you know i i was saying something just now and not not even reading that quote i got a picture in my mind but i heard back from saying it but i think what he said here just not explained that now he says the first thing you know you you have a shaky body that begins to weather and you get pains and and is moving through your body he says uh uh all of those things are all the chills of death that begin to move up our sleeves amen he says but then look yandere there is a brand new body that is standing right there amen amen praise the lord just move out of this one right into that one praise the lord i read some articles to you during the week you know where brother branham talks about how we go over shadows and shadows and ravers and ravers and rivers i will read that to you and i was i will explain something when we get there and uh but but by year year it it explained you know just like i said even even some of those uh uh are saints uh that went through the spears that you know that had to be saw that were acts you know and and and killed you know for the name of christ you will realize that many of those times they have stepped out of the body they have stepped out of their body and and just be looking at the body going through that amen amen praise the lord job said he talks about uh in job teddy and we read he talks about uh who have laid the measure thereof if they'll know it and who have stretched the line thereof in exodus chapter 23 the scripture says exodus 23 verse 26 verse 25 and ye shall save the lord god the lord your god and he shall bless the bread he shall bless thy bread and bless thy water and i will take sickness away from the midst of day there shall nothing cast their young non-be barren in thy land the number of that days will are fulfilled praise the lord now as we as we were talking about uh you know as we were talking about maturity and growing up a couple of weeks ago and we i refer to this scripture you know the bible talking about nothing being boring and uh uh you know we can we can hold to it physically we can hold to it spiritually and uh uh but as you look at a year what what my what my mind on is on it is that the scripture says the normal of that days i will fulfill okay so god brings us to the number of our days you know like brother branham says he says i don't want to live one day over my time oh my goodness you know if it is if it is our time and which of course we believe and uh for some some of you that that got my texts i sent out you know i i believe that i don't believe that coronavirus took brother scat i believe that he ran his race amen i believe that he ran his race and uh and he fought uh you know i mean for for many of us that not doing it during the the lockdown uh in the heat of everything i mean every service that we had at brother jordan's house at a time we couldn't go to church it was brother scott that was leading songs that's right yes praise the lord he was the one that was leading sons how many i mean it was just two weeks ago we saw that in the office there and i was talking to him and sharing some things with him uh uh my concern about the sun service and we were just talking about some few things and he just said you know whatever you want me to do brother one just let me know you know then now uh by the matter of fact he was supposed to leave songs today because brother jordan was going to preach i was supposed to be in atkinson uh with brother prater and uh berskaya was supposed to leave songs today so but you know we just believe that you know just like the scripture says god measure out our day you know he's the one that have drawn the line he draw the line and we cannot go beyond it the same god that draw the line that the water cannot come over the land is god that have given the boundary and he's the same one that has given our boundary you know as believers you know then and and that is the thing that's the thing that kicks in our fear our faith to deal with the fear factor that death cannot take our life until god is done with us that's right amen because he draws the line he outnumbered our days amen thank you jesus praise the lord he have numbered our days you know and he has drawn the line this is a brand new body and we move right into it a continuing yet in resurrection of jesus christ for when this effort tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting just to move into a new one not made with hands but god has made it function internally the glory of god to move right into it to become new and young again to never be sick praise the lord he will never have to deal with diabetes anymore amen he never had to do another stem for his heart anymore he had moved into a new body
