[1:25:33] amen
[1:25:34] amen sure appreciate god's grace to us
[1:25:37] if you've got your bible this morning
[1:25:39] i'd like for you to turn with me if you
[1:25:41] could
[1:25:42] to the book of galatians
[1:25:45] now the lord helping us i want to speak
[1:25:47] to you this morning upon
[1:25:49] jesus
[1:25:50] understands
[1:25:51] our weaknesses
[1:25:53] jesus
[1:25:54] understands our weaknesses
[1:25:56] galatians chapter 2
[1:25:58] we'll look at verse 20 the lord helping
[1:26:00] us galatians 2 verse 20.
[1:26:04] now
[1:26:04] uh as you're turning we're going to
[1:26:08] just look now at a little thought here
[1:26:11] the lord helping us upon
[1:26:14] what we are as christians and how we
[1:26:15] operate as christians how we function as
[1:26:17] christians and what i'm going to try to
[1:26:19] do
[1:26:20] if the lord will help me is i'm going to
[1:26:22] try to offer you a lot of liberty and
[1:26:24] deliverance and grace
[1:26:26] and to give you a little bit more of a
[1:26:29] reprieve
[1:26:30] from a legalistic mindset
[1:26:33] the lord will help me
[1:26:35] now i'm going to bend grace so so much
[1:26:39] that you may start thinking well this
[1:26:41] sounds like disgrace well i'm going to
[1:26:43] stay right in the bible with all of my
[1:26:45] limits and boundaries and limitations
[1:26:47] so you just remember that when i'm
[1:26:49] preaching this that this is not
[1:26:51] me saying
[1:26:52] live any way you want to live do
[1:26:54] anything you want to do act any way you
[1:26:55] want to act let me say right out the
[1:26:57] gate if that kind of thing is in your
[1:27:00] heart anyways to do anything you want to
[1:27:02] do if it's pleasing the lord displeasing
[1:27:04] doesn't matter well then in that regard
[1:27:06] you really don't have the baptism of the
[1:27:08] holy ghost like you might think you do
[1:27:10] because christians want to please the
[1:27:11] lord yes
[1:27:13] amen galatians chapter 2 verse 20.
[1:27:17] paul says i am crucified with christ
[1:27:21] nevertheless
[1:27:22] i live
[1:27:24] yet not i
[1:27:26] but christ liveth in me
[1:27:28] the life which i now live in the flesh
[1:27:32] i live by the faith
[1:27:35] of the son of god amen do you notice he
[1:27:37] doesn't even live by his own faith
[1:27:38] that's right
[1:27:40] now i'm going to tell you right now if i
[1:27:42] had to live by my own faith
[1:27:44] heaven help me
[1:27:46] because sometimes today i want to be a
[1:27:48] christian tomorrow
[1:27:52] weekend after that yeah i feel amen
[1:27:54] praise the lord hallelujah two days
[1:27:56] after that
[1:27:58] wake up the next morning glory to god
[1:28:00] his mercy is new by the afternoon
[1:28:04] anybody know what i'm talking about
[1:28:06] that's what living by your faith looks
[1:28:08] like
[1:28:08] but living by his faith it doesn't
[1:28:10] matter if you're
[1:28:12] or you're just straight on through the
[1:28:15] course
[1:28:16] amen
[1:28:17] notice he says i do not frustrate
[1:28:21] the grace of god
[1:28:23] i do not frustrate the grace of god for
[1:28:26] if righteousness came by the law come by
[1:28:29] the law then christ is dead
[1:28:32] in vain so for you that are standing
[1:28:34] here this morning you that might join on
[1:28:36] the internet or get this sermon later
[1:28:38] if in your opinion
[1:28:40] in order to be a genuine christian to be
[1:28:42] born again of the holy spirit the idea
[1:28:45] is
[1:28:45] you've got to live a life if that's the
[1:28:48] idea that you've got that you have got
[1:28:50] to live a life
[1:28:51] then you really don't even understand
[1:28:53] calvary in the first place
[1:28:56] figure y'all would react that way so i'm
[1:28:59] going to quote it now that i'm going to
[1:29:00] read it later
[1:29:02] it's not whether
[1:29:04] you live the life
[1:29:06] right i'm going to leave you hanging
[1:29:07] right there and then we'll talk a lot
[1:29:09] that's right let's pray together with
[1:29:10] the word thank you lord jesus thank you
[1:29:12] for your great message of the hour thank
[1:29:15] you for this great apostle paul this
[1:29:17] prophet of god who
[1:29:18] wrote to us eternal things
[1:29:20] lord jesus as we have this great
[1:29:23] spiritual book laying ahead of us and
[1:29:25] fathers the bible lays open here on this
[1:29:27] platform today
[1:29:29] i lord know that you said your letter
[1:29:31] would kill but the spirit would bring it
[1:29:33] life
[1:29:34] and so i pray that you would anoint and
[1:29:35] quicken every word of god that'll be
[1:29:37] spoken today use my mouth and my mind to
[1:29:40] be a instrument that you can use me for
[1:29:42] your glory and lord jesus anoint their
[1:29:45] hearts and minds that they might receive
[1:29:47] directly from the throne of god as we
[1:29:50] commit this to your hands both speaker
[1:29:53] and listener in the name of jesus christ
[1:29:55] we pray and the saints said amen
[1:29:58] god bless you you may be seated may the
[1:30:00] lord bless you really good
[1:30:02] now let's just get it all on the table
[1:30:05] while we got a chance to because i don't
[1:30:06] want you guessing for the rest of the
[1:30:08] service where i'm going
[1:30:09] there are two schools of thought in
[1:30:11] every type of movement be it even the
[1:30:14] buddhists islam christianity the
[1:30:16] catholics there's always two schools of
[1:30:18] thought when it comes to religion and
[1:30:20] that is the legal aside and the grace
[1:30:23] side now depending on how a group or a
[1:30:27] group of people would uh define the way
[1:30:30] that that that looks or what's said
[1:30:32] about that or how that is approached
[1:30:34] of course it might be a different thing
[1:30:37] i talk to many catholics some of the
[1:30:40] online teaching that i do i teach in
[1:30:41] poland to
[1:30:43] older people and business people and
[1:30:44] leaders and things of that nature and
[1:30:46] you know poland is predominantly a
[1:30:48] catholic country like 80 percent
[1:30:50] catholic they all take holidays during
[1:30:51] the catholic holidays and what more and
[1:30:54] some of them will tell me well there are
[1:30:56] practicing catholics that are very
[1:30:58] devout about their religion they are
[1:31:01] just strict when they don't eat they're
[1:31:03] not eating and we're not drinking
[1:31:04] they're not drinking and when they eat
[1:31:05] they're supposed to eat they eat and
[1:31:07] they're just right every letter of it
[1:31:09] and then there are those that believe
[1:31:10] within that movement that god has a lot
[1:31:13] of grace on people and you know if they
[1:31:15] slide by mass every now and then or you
[1:31:17] know or they just maybe not get to
[1:31:19] confessional right at that moment ah you
[1:31:21] know the lord understands and they just
[1:31:24] kind of keep moving along with their
[1:31:25] momentum of life and you know when they
[1:31:27] get around to it they get around to it
[1:31:30] and they practice their piety when they
[1:31:32] feel like it and hearing that of course
[1:31:35] you know being a message preacher one of
[1:31:37] the first things my mind goes to is the
[1:31:39] same kind of stuff that i've heard
[1:31:41] around our ranks there are those that
[1:31:43] are so spiritual
[1:31:45] and they're so religious and they're so
[1:31:48] pious for this message that they
[1:31:50] wouldn't even so much as even buy a
[1:31:52] chocolate bar after on on church on
[1:31:55] sunday and they are so spiritual and so
[1:31:58] high and so elevated in the things of
[1:32:01] god and many times people like that
[1:32:03] usually are no earthly good whatsoever
[1:32:05] their head or two heads too high in the
[1:32:07] clouds then you have the people that are
[1:32:09] like i don't hurt you it won't bother
[1:32:12] you you're a believer your name's on the
[1:32:14] book of life and god put it on the
[1:32:16] lamb's book of life and you know you can
[1:32:18] get away with this and get away with
[1:32:21] that now here's the amazing thing about
[1:32:23] both of these schools of thought there
[1:32:25] is truth in both sides of it and in
[1:32:27] order to balance the christian walk with
[1:32:30] god we have to learn where those
[1:32:32] balances lay and in order to really
[1:32:35] convey the message i want to convey to
[1:32:37] you this morning i'm going to use one
[1:32:39] word and that word is leniency
[1:32:42] looking at what paul said here in the
[1:32:44] book of galatians that 21st verse he
[1:32:47] said i do not frustrate the grace of god
[1:32:51] now that in itself gives us the
[1:32:52] indication that it is possible to
[1:32:55] frustrate god's grace to the point to
[1:32:57] where he wants to deal with you but then
[1:33:00] it also hints to us that there is a
[1:33:02] level of leniency and an amount of
[1:33:05] leniency that god gives to a person
[1:33:07] before he becomes frustrated and all of
[1:33:10] the fathers and the mothers this morning
[1:33:12] screamed hallelujah you're talking about
[1:33:14] me and my children for sure amen now you
[1:33:17] understand that to be a genuine
[1:33:19] christian there is an element of
[1:33:21] holiness that comes with our walk with
[1:33:24] god but i want you to think about the
[1:33:26] other side the legalistic side of
[1:33:28] holiness is something that is
[1:33:30] manufactured something that is built up
[1:33:33] by the person themselves and sisters
[1:33:35] please understand i'm going to pick on
[1:33:37] you just a little bit on account of the
[1:33:39] fact that you're the most visible out
[1:33:40] there but you know your hair and your
[1:33:42] dress and these type of things they are
[1:33:45] in place not because in order to do that
[1:33:48] you get a free pass into heaven but we
[1:33:50] do those things to be pleasing to the
[1:33:52] lord jesus
[1:33:54] as we know the bible taught us that a
[1:33:56] woman is supposed to have her hair a
[1:33:57] certain way men are supposed to have
[1:33:59] their hair a certain way and uh you know
[1:34:01] it's something that we follow not for
[1:34:04] the letter of the law so that we might
[1:34:06] gain favor with the lord but that we
[1:34:08] might show by our life that we love him
[1:34:12] that we're willing to do what he asked
[1:34:14] us to do in spite of all the persecution
[1:34:17] and all of the back and uh the back back
[1:34:19] biting and the backlashing and the uh
[1:34:22] all of those things that we go through
[1:34:23] just
[1:34:24] the terrible stuff sometimes that women
[1:34:26] in this day and age have to go through
[1:34:28] that choose to serve the lord you know i
[1:34:29] really feel for you sis because you're
[1:34:31] living in an environment where every
[1:34:33] store every gas station every mall every
[1:34:36] place you might go the women will look
[1:34:38] the complete opposite of you and yet the
[1:34:41] same time you hear come come to church
[1:34:43] like this and you hear a preacher saying
[1:34:45] oh you better live right or else or you
[1:34:47] better have that hair or else or you
[1:34:49] better not do or else and see i really
[1:34:52] feel that in the years that i've served
[1:34:54] the lord and preached that we have
[1:34:56] gotten so out of balance when it comes
[1:34:58] to those things and we hear brother
[1:35:00] branham of course just hammering away on
[1:35:02] the tapes at how people are supposed to
[1:35:04] live how they're supposed to behave but
[1:35:06] something we need to remember about the
[1:35:09] prophet's ministry is that brother
[1:35:11] branham was in an environment of all of
[1:35:14] these different denominations there was
[1:35:15] no message churches there was no message
[1:35:18] pastors there was no established message
[1:35:20] of the hour all they know is that this
[1:35:22] man from kentucky indiana william
[1:35:25] branham had come from a bad background
[1:35:27] that's got some gifts from the lord is
[1:35:29] preaching and establishing things from
[1:35:31] the bible in a way that was different
[1:35:33] from many other people but in his day
[1:35:35] and age in order to make all of the
[1:35:38] boundaries very clear brother branham
[1:35:40] had to get very very hard in order for
[1:35:43] you to know what a good woman looks like
[1:35:45] he had to so expose the bad till he got
[1:35:48] right down to being insulting he got
[1:35:51] offensive and he said things that a
[1:35:53] modern-day woman in 2022 just doesn't
[1:35:56] want to hear out of anybody's mouth much
[1:35:58] less a preacher a prophet of god
[1:36:00] and yet the real bride of jesus christ
[1:36:03] that can understand the purpose behind
[1:36:06] why brother branham chose to preach the
[1:36:08] way that he did the real sisters that
[1:36:11] catch the revelation of that of that
[1:36:13] part itself the behind back part of why
[1:36:15] he was doing it those are the ones that
[1:36:18] will join them on the other side beyond
[1:36:20] the curtain of time screaming and
[1:36:22] running our precious brother our
[1:36:24] precious brother so but the the idea
[1:36:26] amongst message people is that well if i
[1:36:29] live right i live clean i believe the
[1:36:31] message if i press play and obey well
[1:36:34] i've got it and friend here's where the
[1:36:36] misconception has come in and i dare say
[1:36:38] that for the last 60 years we have had
[1:36:41] so much confusion about what it means to
[1:36:44] look like a christian act like a
[1:36:46] christian walk like a christian we use
[1:36:48] all kinds of of of of proof and backing
[1:36:52] of what we believe a believer is you
[1:36:54] know i i'm wearing a beard and i have
[1:36:56] for some years now and when i've hot for
[1:36:58] years for years i always kept clean
[1:37:01] shaving because i heard preachers all
[1:37:03] the time preaching ah these men with
[1:37:05] these worldly beards and these men and i
[1:37:08] i just got to thank him one day where's
[1:37:09] that in the bible where did brother
[1:37:11] branham actually ever preach such things
[1:37:13] as that i found a few statements where
[1:37:15] he said that if jesus come to us in the
[1:37:18] 20th century he'd be in a three-piece
[1:37:20] business suit he'd be clean shaving
[1:37:22] standing there just like a normal person
[1:37:24] then a guy got onto me one time he said
[1:37:26] see there the prophet said he'd be clean
[1:37:28] shaven i said yes but you come to church
[1:37:30] in overhauls i want to see you sunday in
[1:37:32] your three-piece suit
[1:37:34] amen now what we've done is we've taken
[1:37:37] things in such a literal manner when
[1:37:40] brother branham was only trying to
[1:37:42] create a picture for us of what it's
[1:37:44] supposed to look like remember friends
[1:37:47] even though he was the messenger of god
[1:37:49] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:37:51] the world to reveal the secrets of god
[1:37:54] and the mysteries of god to you and i
[1:37:56] brother branham was not given the gift
[1:37:58] of micromanagement he was not given the
[1:38:00] gift of meddling and he was not given an
[1:38:02] anointing to go into your homes into
[1:38:05] your refrigerator amen into your into
[1:38:07] your place where you'll be hiding your
[1:38:09] tv or your christmas tree or any of the
[1:38:11] such life and try to accuse or get into
[1:38:14] your closet try to throw you in hell for
[1:38:17] every little thing that went on the
[1:38:20] prophet of god no no friend that's what
[1:38:21] we've done in this message
[1:38:23] well you can holler amen or just stare
[1:38:25] at me it's up to you but fair warning
[1:38:28] i'm coming on anyhow
[1:38:31] right i'm coming on with it anyways now
[1:38:33] and see even things like i mentioned
[1:38:35] christmas and every time i say that from
[1:38:37] the bible i can feel the jolts from
[1:38:38] people it's like lightning bolts oh god
[1:38:40] where is he going well that's the thing
[1:38:43] i am not called of god to drive by house
[1:38:46] to house if i was a pastor and i had a
[1:38:48] local assembly i wouldn't want to get
[1:38:50] out on christmas tribe and go straight
[1:38:52] by street by street to figure out okay
[1:38:54] are there blinking lights in the corners
[1:38:55] of those curtains uh ask the wife uh sam
[1:38:58] do you see is there a blue or red is it
[1:39:01] reflecting through the windows
[1:39:03] get your notes ready take notes we got
[1:39:05] to figure out who we're going to preach
[1:39:06] against on sunday but you see the bible
[1:39:09] said that you are to work out your
[1:39:12] salvation with fear and trembling the
[1:39:15] message of the hour was not designed to
[1:39:18] meddle into every detail of a man or
[1:39:21] woman's life come on preach to me a
[1:39:22] little while
[1:39:23] amen this is why friends that when you
[1:39:25] start reading the message and the bible
[1:39:27] for that matter there are certain things
[1:39:29] that are silent in the scripture for
[1:39:32] example i've lost count of the times
[1:39:34] that young men and married men and women
[1:39:36] will come to me and talk to me about
[1:39:38] relationship type things that go on in
[1:39:41] the bedroom and they'll ask for
[1:39:42] scriptures they'll ask for quotes
[1:39:44] they'll ask for evidence and proofs of
[1:39:46] how a man or woman is supposed to behave
[1:39:49] sexually one to another do you ever
[1:39:51] notice that very little has been wrote
[1:39:53] in the bible or in the message about
[1:39:55] those very things do you know why
[1:39:57] because god will leave it up to you and
[1:40:00] your wife how that you decide to express
[1:40:03] yourself one to another and those that
[1:40:06] have clean minds oh that have clean
[1:40:08] hands the holy ghost will lead you in
[1:40:10] what goes on behind your bedroom door
[1:40:14] amen brother ben preach i think i will
[1:40:17] it's not the pastor's job it's not the
[1:40:20] evangelist job it wasn't brother
[1:40:22] branham's job it's nobody's job but your
[1:40:26] own to figure those kind of things out
[1:40:30] now there are certain things if it's
[1:40:31] crude and rude and obvious then you know
[1:40:34] in your own conscience whether you're
[1:40:35] crossing lines or not
[1:40:37] and don't act stupid like you don't know
[1:40:39] what i'm talking about you do you
[1:40:41] understand it i'm in a room full of
[1:40:42] adult people for the most part and you
[1:40:44] say oh god oh god don't say that in
[1:40:46] front of our young people these men up
[1:40:48] here probably know these girls probably
[1:40:50] know more about it than you do
[1:40:53] praise the lord that's right because
[1:40:55] they've been exposed to more through the
[1:40:57] telephone through the internet than we
[1:40:59] ever experienced some of the things that
[1:41:01] my daughters are challenged with through
[1:41:03] tick tock and instagram and all of the
[1:41:05] things you see in social media and
[1:41:07] youtube and what more it absolutely
[1:41:09] completely baffles my mind that the
[1:41:12] generation of young people we've got in
[1:41:14] this message today they are confronted
[1:41:17] and exposed
[1:41:18] with every imaginable thing under the
[1:41:20] sun
[1:41:22] it's hard to believe that some of the
[1:41:23] things my girls have already been
[1:41:25] exposed to and the middle one just
[1:41:27] turned 13.
[1:41:29] and yet she's got friends suicidal that
[1:41:31] cut themselves that are hooked on drugs
[1:41:33] that's already been in juvenile jail and
[1:41:36] they're not even out of the seventh
[1:41:37] grade people
[1:41:40] the world as we are living in it today
[1:41:42] is completely different than when you
[1:41:44] were growing up and it's different from
[1:41:47] when brother branham was coming up
[1:41:50] that's why there are elements of this
[1:41:51] message that remain between you and
[1:41:54] almighty god
[1:41:56] and you can see that attitude whenever
[1:41:58] they start talking to brother branham
[1:41:59] brother branham is it all right if a
[1:42:01] woman wears pajamas to bed
[1:42:04] can i shave my legs brother turn around
[1:42:07] hand the thing to billy paul did you see
[1:42:09] that well they can ask some burners
[1:42:11] can't they
[1:42:12] you see and this is the reason why
[1:42:14] brother branham didn't spend time you
[1:42:16] never hear him start out all right i'm
[1:42:18] going to get you all together here at
[1:42:19] the tabernacle and we're going to start
[1:42:21] a sermon series on these ungodly
[1:42:23] jezebels plucking their eyebrows
[1:42:28] you never find the prophet of god going
[1:42:31] to extremes
[1:42:32] to identify such things as that why he
[1:42:35] trusted that if you got the main part
[1:42:37] down and the main elements of the holy
[1:42:39] ghost and the revelation that jesus
[1:42:42] would lead you
[1:42:44] in all the rest of it
[1:42:46] [Applause]
[1:42:48] but be careful to sweep your own steps
[1:42:52] keep your broom off mine
[1:42:55] you ain't got no business on my steps
[1:42:57] and i ain't got no business on your
[1:42:59] steps come on preach me a little while
[1:43:01] you sweep your steps i'll sweep mine
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:06] amen you go to some churches and the
[1:43:08] women are not allowed to wear any
[1:43:10] jewelry
[1:43:11] you go to some churches they better not
[1:43:13] have an open-toed shoe or you'll wind up
[1:43:15] in hell
[1:43:17] you know what the problem is people are
[1:43:20] trying to bring you into the holy ghost
[1:43:23] via legalism
[1:43:27] you know what i found that if a man or
[1:43:29] woman gets truly born again
[1:43:31] god will tell them
[1:43:34] whether the thing is right or not
[1:43:37] i i'm gonna pick on jordan for five
[1:43:39] seconds but his shirt reminds me of an
[1:43:41] experience i had
[1:43:43] i used to have one of the flowery types
[1:43:45] thing i like those now this is nice i'm
[1:43:46] not i'm not throwing off on that shirt
[1:43:48] but years ago i'm talking about like
[1:43:50] 1991.
[1:43:52] my mother had bought me a set of shirts
[1:43:54] like that and that particular time they
[1:43:56] were all the rage very very popular and
[1:43:59] i'd wear that thing and i'd feel so
[1:44:00] condemned i wouldn't even know how to
[1:44:03] think about it because of course back
[1:44:04] then we were taught in the message that
[1:44:06] a man wasn't even allowed to wear a
[1:44:07] colored shirt to the pulpit
[1:44:10] you african saints would be absolutely
[1:44:12] in trouble
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:17] because you know our stupid ignorant
[1:44:20] intelligent brilliant americans we have
[1:44:22] been preaching our pentecostal apostolic
[1:44:25] tommy rod for 60 years now
[1:44:28] and i can't think of an african church
[1:44:30] going back a hundred years that ain't
[1:44:32] dressed in bright colors
[1:44:34] when the prophet has the vision of the
[1:44:36] bride
[1:44:37] they were all in their national garb he
[1:44:40] said colors and everything like that
[1:44:44] y'all getting quiet but here we come
[1:44:46] you realize this is why if we're not
[1:44:48] careful we will form our own doctrines
[1:44:51] of holiness and start sweeping
[1:44:54] everybody's steps off instead of leading
[1:44:57] them to jesus and letting him do the
[1:44:59] work
[1:45:02] we have an expression catch the fish
[1:45:04] before you clean it that's right
[1:45:07] amen
[1:45:09] but the problem is is that we have
[1:45:11] because of such exposure in the message
[1:45:14] of the hour we have such a knowledge of
[1:45:16] what the prophet said
[1:45:19] and of course
[1:45:20] when it comes to length of dress
[1:45:22] if a woman had did not have her dress
[1:45:25] plumbed to the ground where she's
[1:45:26] stepping on it somehow she's a sinner
[1:45:29] until
[1:45:30] you see a picture of brother branham's
[1:45:32] daughters
[1:45:33] and his wife
[1:45:34] and their dress came just below their
[1:45:36] knees standing in sitting
[1:45:39] well hallelujah
[1:45:42] oh but men and women better cover up
[1:45:44] yeah especially from you because you got
[1:45:46] that old spirit on you you heathen you
[1:45:50] a lot of times when you got men standing
[1:45:52] there blasted at the women like that to
[1:45:54] stop dressing sexy to stop looking this
[1:45:56] way that way it's because old boy's got
[1:45:59] a problem and not you
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:02] amen
[1:46:04] right a real son of god doesn't have to
[1:46:06] worry amen about the women walk in this
[1:46:08] world amen it's got the power of god
[1:46:10] down inside of his heart that gives him
[1:46:13] the understanding of how to live and how
[1:46:15] to act
[1:46:17] some men are so filthy some boys are so
[1:46:19] filthy they lust after a dress hanging
[1:46:21] on a
[1:46:24] fencepost that's in their heart
[1:46:27] so anything they see their goal
[1:46:30] women you better not curl your hair you
[1:46:33] better not you better not why
[1:46:36] she's a woman it's what she wants to do
[1:46:38] she's made and built to want to look
[1:46:40] pretty
[1:46:42] sis if you're going to haul a man now's
[1:46:44] your time
[1:46:48] right
[1:46:50] now i will go on record quickly and say
[1:46:52] if any of the brothers want to curl
[1:46:54] their hair and look pretty i'm having a
[1:46:56] prayer line expeditiously at the end of
[1:46:58] this service
[1:47:01] right it's not built into the men them
[1:47:03] with their shorts on but the rest of
[1:47:04] those sickly knees knocking together
[1:47:07] amen but a woman is designed in a
[1:47:09] different way
[1:47:11] she's made to where she wants to look
[1:47:12] beautiful the prophet said your beauty
[1:47:14] was given to you for your mate
[1:47:18] so you know how it is of course if a
[1:47:21] woman doesn't have the flattest of shoes
[1:47:25] that jesse bell
[1:47:27] i eyeballed it she had an inch heel on
[1:47:30] her foot
[1:47:33] heels in the house of god
[1:47:36] and you don't even know why the heels
[1:47:38] are bad
[1:47:39] right the reason the prophet's mother
[1:47:42] had the dream and he used it was because
[1:47:44] the heels were getting so tall
[1:47:47] that they were contorting the shape of
[1:47:49] the woman
[1:47:50] making her rear and her breast stick out
[1:47:53] when your heel gets that high get rid of
[1:47:56] that heel
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:02] amen oh but see here comes the holiness
[1:48:06] police i can feel him
[1:48:08] i can feel him oh my god did you just
[1:48:11] get through saying that a woman could
[1:48:12] wear a heel
[1:48:14] i just said the holy ghost will lead you
[1:48:15] on what's decent and what's not
[1:48:18] it ain't my job
[1:48:20] a woman told my wife some years ago that
[1:48:22] you're a married woman you ought to put
[1:48:24] your hair up on top of your head
[1:48:26] you know you couldn't wear your hair
[1:48:28] down just kept on kept on kept on until
[1:48:30] i finally got enough of it i said to her
[1:48:32] i said
[1:48:33] tell her this next time
[1:48:34] next time she says to you how to wear
[1:48:36] your hair you let her know that your
[1:48:39] husband
[1:48:40] likes that hair
[1:48:41] down
[1:48:45] [Applause]
[1:48:48] and you know what that's all that really
[1:48:50] matters
[1:48:52] if it's not offending the lord because
[1:48:54] you see her hair don't belong to her
[1:48:56] anymore the bible said it's mine
[1:49:00] uh-huh you are reading the bible right
[1:49:02] paul said the woman's body becomes his
[1:49:04] and his becomes her
[1:49:06] so she don't own her hair anymore i own
[1:49:07] it
[1:49:09] all of it is mine
[1:49:11] i reckon that gives me a right to have
[1:49:13] an opinion on what i like
[1:49:15] praise the lord
[1:49:17] right
[1:49:18] but notice the idea becomes that
[1:49:22] we as message people have got to strike
[1:49:25] a standard yes we need to strike a
[1:49:27] standard and provide an example but not
[1:49:29] based on man-made ideas
[1:49:32] this is why people get so tripped up at
[1:49:33] christmas time
[1:49:35] we know that christmas is a pagan
[1:49:37] holiday but deny me one holiday that
[1:49:39] ain't pagan
[1:49:41] name them
[1:49:42] i'm waiting on you
[1:49:44] a hot february valentine's day
[1:49:46] uh-huh oh you sister like him flowers
[1:49:48] don't you
[1:49:49] some of you all anti-christmas people in
[1:49:52] here i wouldn't have one of them devil
[1:49:54] eye dollar trees
[1:49:57] i wouldn't talk about i wouldn't go see
[1:49:59] lies i'll hide in a cave on the 25th of
[1:50:02] december but when the 14th of february
[1:50:05] comes along how do i love feet let me
[1:50:08] count the waves
[1:50:12] brother everything we look at is pagan
[1:50:17] but the holy ghost leads you on what is
[1:50:19] right and what is wrong why do you think
[1:50:21] brother had a tree
[1:50:23] because brother branham wasn't only
[1:50:24] stinking legalists that made everything
[1:50:26] the devil
[1:50:30] and you can tell by the lack of amens in
[1:50:32] this church i'm right where i need to be
[1:50:35] [Applause]
[1:50:38] right and we're scared to even holler at
[1:50:39] men about this kind of stuff
[1:50:41] all right be careful now you punch some
[1:50:43] of you men and probably punch in your
[1:50:44] wife be careful don't tell on us don't
[1:50:46] say nothing don't you blink your eyes
[1:50:48] this church will know we got a treat and
[1:50:50] that treatment in that attic i like
[1:50:52] christmas now and i want my presence i
[1:50:55] want my goats you know i don't like
[1:50:56] anything going on and there's how don't
[1:50:58] you let nobody know it
[1:51:02] hide it in the name of jesus hide it
[1:51:10] and yet when it comes to salvation
[1:51:13] look at how some of our children have
[1:51:14] been raised in this country
[1:51:17] they've come up hating the message of
[1:51:20] the hour
[1:51:21] because we have so grieved them
[1:51:24] with our legalistic ideas
[1:51:27] from the message of the hour
[1:51:29] i know what brother banham said that
[1:51:31] anybody that celebrates this much
[1:51:33] attention will burn with it but he also
[1:51:36] come to the tabernacle and thanked him
[1:51:37] for their christmas gift that they gave
[1:51:39] him every year a brand new suit of color
[1:51:42] of clothes yes
[1:51:44] well maybe didn't know this but while
[1:51:46] i'm here i'm going to build a few
[1:51:47] tabernacles
[1:51:49] brother branham used to like to go from
[1:51:51] house to house every year
[1:51:53] and see the christmas trees and how
[1:51:55] they'd been decorated in the saints
[1:51:57] house sure y'all didn't know that did
[1:51:59] you
[1:52:00] i can hear legalistic bubbles
[1:52:02] [Laughter]
[1:52:06] now remember the idea that i'm trying to
[1:52:08] show you is that in christianity it is
[1:52:10] not about a rule of do or don't a child
[1:52:14] of god knows when something is right
[1:52:17] and when something is wrong
[1:52:20] come on somebody help me this morning
[1:52:24] right this is why paul said i do not
[1:52:27] frustrate the grace of god he said not
[1:52:30] all things are lawful not all things are
[1:52:33] expedient but i serve the lord on the
[1:52:36] dictates of my old conscience
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:40] the only thing he cautioned us against
[1:52:41] was to watch your example before weaker
[1:52:44] believers
[1:52:45] younger men and women that have not
[1:52:47] established themselves yet and they can
[1:52:49] study and read and sin they don't know
[1:52:50] how to balance things you need to watch
[1:52:52] your example don't be cavalier when it
[1:52:54] comes to how you live to some brand new
[1:52:56] believer oh that won't bother you that
[1:52:58] maybe it will
[1:53:00] leave them alone and let them learn how
[1:53:02] to do it just like you learned how to do
[1:53:03] it
[1:53:06] right you look at the critics
[1:53:09] when believe the sign rod bergen jeremy
[1:53:11] and all the rest of them and john
[1:53:12] collins and the bunch started out with
[1:53:14] their websites
[1:53:16] and they started attacking this message
[1:53:18] you can hear john call and say how that
[1:53:20] they said they believe the message but
[1:53:22] every time in halloween you can see the
[1:53:24] light flickering from where they were
[1:53:26] watching their televisions in the
[1:53:27] basement
[1:53:29] too holy to people going
[1:53:31] trick-or-treating
[1:53:32] but not holy enough for a television
[1:53:35] don't you understand these broken people
[1:53:38] that are projecting to the believers of
[1:53:40] this message that those are the things
[1:53:43] that drove them out it was not
[1:53:45] it wasn't a television that caused a man
[1:53:47] or woman to fall it wasn't halloween or
[1:53:49] christmas that caused in the fall it was
[1:53:51] a false revelation and understanding of
[1:53:54] how a christian can conduct himself with
[1:53:57] freedom and liberty and yet remain holy
[1:54:00] all the days of their life
[1:54:04] you know who i blame by the one
[1:54:05] preachers
[1:54:07] we have preached according to our own
[1:54:08] agendas we have preached according to
[1:54:11] what we think will please the people
[1:54:13] we've tried to tickle their ear and get
[1:54:15] the offerings bigger and yet we have
[1:54:17] failed to preach where they're living at
[1:54:20] if god gives me grace the next 31 years
[1:54:22] i've got on this earth if god give it i
[1:54:25] want to preach to you and where you're
[1:54:27] at
[1:54:29] [Applause]
[1:54:30] who in here don't know the revelation of
[1:54:32] the hour who in here doesn't understand
[1:54:34] the son of man we all understand water
[1:54:37] baptism and the wonders of the godhead
[1:54:39] but whether or not you're allowed to
[1:54:41] wear a certain thing or not that's where
[1:54:43] you get tripped up at
[1:54:45] and you start looking for answers
[1:54:48] so you go to one person they'll tell you
[1:54:50] about some spiritual dream they had
[1:54:53] one time i
[1:54:54] said sister tell samantha that's one
[1:54:55] time she was looking at a christmas tree
[1:54:57] and the spirit of the lord spoke to her
[1:54:59] see that's where it gets your attention
[1:55:01] right
[1:55:05] god spoke to you
[1:55:07] it's nothing but a painted
[1:55:11] i even heard some amens just then
[1:55:14] but that's all right to feel like that
[1:55:16] if you want to feel like that
[1:55:18] but before you start throwing people in
[1:55:20] hell don't forget your prophet had a
[1:55:22] tree
[1:55:22] in the house and presence in the car
[1:55:25] when he got hit on the armadillo highway
[1:55:27] in texas right before he died
[1:55:30] i'll just let you amen that a while
[1:55:32] the idea is not to get so caught up in
[1:55:35] the legalistic notion
[1:55:37] that your works are going to make you
[1:55:40] have a spot in heaven
[1:55:42] or in the rapture of the resurrection
[1:55:45] legalism never produced a birth from the
[1:55:48] word
[1:55:50] that's why jesus come y'all
[1:55:54] amen
[1:55:56] that's why jesus go paul just got
[1:55:57] through saying it right here he said if
[1:55:59] righteousness came by the law then
[1:56:02] christ died in vain
[1:56:05] no man can live the truth every word no
[1:56:07] woman can live it to every letter it
[1:56:10] took jesus christ amen to put us in a
[1:56:13] condition where we can live this gospel
[1:56:15] 1 000
[1:56:17] [Music]
[1:56:19] you can't live it of yourself
[1:56:22] it takes the lord to get you there
[1:56:26] well i did have friends and here i can
[1:56:28] hear the facebook unlike block unlike
[1:56:31] unfriended
[1:56:35] amen well that's all right if they
[1:56:37] unfriend me maybe some of you will
[1:56:38] friend me back
[1:56:41] the point i'm making is not whether it's
[1:56:43] right or wrong the point is we've taken
[1:56:45] our ideas and made doctrines out of them
[1:56:48] do you wonder there's a reason why the
[1:56:50] bible said as for me and my house
[1:56:53] in other words other houses ain't my
[1:56:54] business
[1:56:56] do you know the only time the scripture
[1:56:58] actually records that we're to be
[1:57:00] concerned about what somebody else is
[1:57:02] into is if you see them overtaken by it
[1:57:06] if your brother becomes overtaken in a
[1:57:09] fault then you that are spiritual
[1:57:12] go and restore such a one to the lord
[1:57:16] outside of that
[1:57:18] we don't need measuring tape when we
[1:57:19] come to church
[1:57:21] how long was her dress
[1:57:24] a dress is awful long because them heels
[1:57:26] are even longer
[1:57:29] they keep notes upon what they think is
[1:57:31] righteous and not righteous
[1:57:34] you can feel the oxygen sucking out of
[1:57:36] the air on these remarks
[1:57:38] because you know you're guilty you're
[1:57:39] just like when i preached it in kentucky
[1:57:41] and indiana you like it when i preached
[1:57:43] over in arkansas you're just the same
[1:57:46] type of people as everybody else i
[1:57:47] preach this to so we might as well just
[1:57:49] go ahead and repent say lord i'm sorry
[1:57:51] i'm guilty i've messed up you're right
[1:57:53] i'm wrong thank you jesus moving on
[1:57:57] right just that simple
[1:57:58] notice the quality of that god he he
[1:58:02] exhibits to us a leniency which is a
[1:58:05] fact or quality of being more merciful
[1:58:08] and tolerant
[1:58:10] than what we expect
[1:58:13] because you see we have been trained to
[1:58:15] believe that god is a just god
[1:58:19] and we've also kind of played off that a
[1:58:21] little bit
[1:58:22] so whenever our children start doing
[1:58:24] things wrong we try to threaten them
[1:58:26] with hell
[1:58:28] you better live right you better do
[1:58:30] right you don't want to wind up in hell
[1:58:32] do you why why do we always go
[1:58:34] with the negative road
[1:58:36] why don't we look at our children and
[1:58:38] say you know how much jesus really loves
[1:58:40] you
[1:58:41] do you know he loves you so much
[1:58:43] that he wants you to do the right thing
[1:58:45] and he's throwing everything in your
[1:58:47] pathway to help you do the right thing
[1:58:50] i i told my middle daughter just the
[1:58:52] other day about the little story
[1:58:54] about the shepherd breaking the sheep's
[1:58:56] leg remember when he went over to
[1:58:58] palestine he saw him carrying up on his
[1:58:59] shoulders like that and he said you
[1:59:01] broke his leg he said oh you're a mean
[1:59:03] shepherd he said no no he said you don't
[1:59:05] understand he said i am a real shepherd
[1:59:08] and i love this little sheep up on my
[1:59:10] shoulders and that broken leg may look
[1:59:12] bad to you but those wolves and those
[1:59:15] lions and those bears are way worse of a
[1:59:18] result than what you're seeing right
[1:59:20] here and i put it on my shoulders and
[1:59:23] broke its leg so i could train it to my
[1:59:25] voice hallelujah that it can learn to
[1:59:27] love me and listen to me and obey me so
[1:59:30] it won't run off the next time
[1:59:35] but we spend so much time threatening
[1:59:37] people preachers you hear them do that
[1:59:39] you better
[1:59:40] don't you say a word about this message
[1:59:42] let me tell you something boy
[1:59:44] if they're not predestinated to see it
[1:59:46] they're going to talk anyways no matter
[1:59:47] what you say
[1:59:49] or how you say it
[1:59:51] and truthfully if we presented the
[1:59:53] message of the hour in a manner in which
[1:59:55] it could be
[1:59:57] embraced and loved and appreciated if we
[2:00:00] didn't always try to act like a bunch of
[2:00:01] weirdos
[2:00:05] people could probably embrace this
[2:00:07] message a little quicker
[2:00:08] but we are guilty in this message of
[2:00:10] doing the very thing brother brown told
[2:00:12] us not to do don't make yourself odd
[2:00:14] don't make yourself strange don't try to
[2:00:16] be super spiritual just live a simple
[2:00:19] christian humble life
[2:00:23] come on somebody help me this morning
[2:00:26] right
[2:00:29] but on the other side of that coin
[2:00:31] somebody said to me that's the problem
[2:00:33] with the message of the hour
[2:00:34] you message people a bunch of adulterers
[2:00:37] and liars and thieves and i said you
[2:00:39] mean the baptist ain't got them
[2:00:43] i don't know if you saw this it was
[2:00:44] national news
[2:00:46] but just just the other day they had a
[2:00:48] baptist convention in tennessee
[2:00:50] and it turns out
[2:00:52] imagine this that in a church
[2:00:54] organization like the baptist the
[2:00:55] president is up for charges
[2:00:58] of multiple manifold underage
[2:01:00] molestations
[2:01:01] and a few of his aides and other people
[2:01:04] are being investigated as well
[2:01:06] because of molestation almost to the
[2:01:09] catholic level
[2:01:13] that's the baptist i'm referring to
[2:01:16] um you ever studied on the history of
[2:01:18] walmart
[2:01:20] no anybody ever study on the history of
[2:01:22] another organization
[2:01:24] if i ever look into a bank how it got
[2:01:26] started or look into a certain business
[2:01:28] how they got started
[2:01:30] would anybody like to talk about
[2:01:31] mcdonald's
[2:01:34] anybody would like to go back and find
[2:01:36] out how mcdonald's actually was stolen
[2:01:39] from the original mcdonald brothers
[2:01:42] y'all are looking at me like a mule
[2:01:43] staring at a new gate
[2:01:45] because you know where i'm going what
[2:01:47] i'm saying to you is it doesn't matter
[2:01:48] wherever moves at we've got problems
[2:01:51] everywhere we turn around so we can't
[2:01:53] turn around blame this message for child
[2:01:55] molesters and rapists and thieves and
[2:01:58] adulterers and all kinds of things we
[2:02:00] can't blame the message that's not what
[2:02:02] brother branham preached to us
[2:02:05] the people are people i don't care what
[2:02:07] room or what what place they're in
[2:02:10] right and until they get born again
[2:02:12] they'll use anything
[2:02:14] for an excuse to do what they want to do
[2:02:16] and live how they want to live
[2:02:20] brother if you don't think so all you
[2:02:21] got to do is just start studying some
[2:02:23] people that's right
[2:02:24] go back and look at some of the greatest
[2:02:26] hockey coaches that you've ever seen i'm
[2:02:28] in minnesota so i'm going to talk about
[2:02:29] your sport go back and look at some of
[2:02:31] the greatest hockey teams and go back
[2:02:33] and look at the miracle and all the
[2:02:34] other things and then start digging down
[2:02:36] to find out what was going on in some of
[2:02:38] them people's lives while they were
[2:02:40] performing the miracle
[2:02:44] you'll never find anywhere in any
[2:02:45] movement i don't care what it is being a
[2:02:47] sport be business be a church
[2:02:49] where everybody walks perfectly
[2:02:52] because without christ it is impossible
[2:02:55] [Music]
[2:02:58] amen praise the lord
[2:03:02] well some of y'all ain't falling off the
[2:03:03] wagon yet so i guess i'm doing pretty
[2:03:05] good
[2:03:06] let's move on
[2:03:07] now notice this paul's saying i do not
[2:03:09] frustrate the grace of god now i see two
[2:03:12] things in this remark first of all i see
[2:03:15] paul in his own dispensation pointing at
[2:03:17] the jews and seeing how that they
[2:03:19] frustrated god with their rituals
[2:03:22] ceremonies even the lord said it's
[2:03:24] become a stink in my nostrils all your
[2:03:26] feasts and your new moons and your
[2:03:28] keeping of sabbas and the washing of
[2:03:30] pots and pans and this and that he said
[2:03:31] it's become a stink in my nostril he
[2:03:34] said your lips say great things but your
[2:03:36] heart is far from me
[2:03:37] [Music]
[2:03:39] and that's very telling if you'll pay
[2:03:40] attention to it because god don't want
[2:03:42] you just performing an act of religious
[2:03:45] osity
[2:03:46] he wants your heart behind what you're
[2:03:47] doing
[2:03:49] and brother even if you're not doing it
[2:03:51] completely right sister even if you're
[2:03:52] not a hundred percent if your heart's
[2:03:54] behind it jesus is all behind you
[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:04:00] now see that was positive that was
[2:04:02] encouraging i'm not just being a bully
[2:04:03] and being mean
[2:04:06] now watch this in second peter chapter 3
[2:04:08] verse 8
[2:04:09] 8-9 you love the bible
[2:04:12] me too
[2:04:14] but beloved
[2:04:17] be not ignorant of this one thing
[2:04:22] that one day is with the lord as a
[2:04:24] thousand years
[2:04:28] and a thousand years is one day
[2:04:33] now in the whole of your
[2:04:35] existence on this earth
[2:04:38] i'm 45 years old
[2:04:40] uh sister naomi's 25 years old sam is
[2:04:43] 19.
[2:04:45] uh you brothers are probably what in
[2:04:46] your 60s 50s 60s something like that
[2:04:50] come on brother
[2:04:53] but in the lifetime of even the oldest
[2:04:56] human being what was it 119 years i
[2:04:58] think in china
[2:05:00] in a span of
[2:05:02] 119 years what do you think that really
[2:05:05] looks like
[2:05:06] to a god that goes through seven church
[2:05:09] ages
[2:05:10] looks down at his watch after the white
[2:05:12] throne and goes
[2:05:14] what a week that
[2:05:18] was comes to the end of a thousand years
[2:05:22] and says wow what a day
[2:05:26] you see when you look at it in its
[2:05:28] proper scale
[2:05:30] then that five or six minute mistake
[2:05:33] or that week-long fight you had with
[2:05:35] your husband or wife or that six-month
[2:05:38] battle you've had with your kids or
[2:05:39] whatever it may be or that besetting sin
[2:05:42] that's been knocking you around for 15
[2:05:44] years or so in the eyes of a god who a
[2:05:47] thousand years is like a day
[2:05:50] is it really that big of a deal
[2:05:56] compared to how we look at it to him
[2:06:00] it really is not that big of a deal
[2:06:02] but now we treat sin
[2:06:05] and we treat it in a certain manner
[2:06:06] that's actually not in the
[2:06:08] characteristic of how god looks at it
[2:06:10] i know god is holy he's so pure he's so
[2:06:13] holy he's so righteous the least little
[2:06:16] thing will disturb yes all of that is
[2:06:18] true but don't forget to flip your coin
[2:06:20] over and preach the other side too
[2:06:22] that the very same god that hates and
[2:06:25] abhors sin and even the least little
[2:06:28] thing will grieve his heart was the same
[2:06:30] god that let man go for nearly two
[2:06:33] thousand years to the analuvian
[2:06:35] destruction and came after 2000 years
[2:06:38] and said you know what it grieves me i
[2:06:41] cries what the meaning of that word was
[2:06:43] i cry in my heart that i even made man
[2:06:46] for him to fall in this mess in the
[2:06:47] first place
[2:06:50] and yet god still had such leniency on
[2:06:53] humanity
[2:06:55] that he gave him a chance to get from
[2:06:58] one spot to another
[2:07:01] 2000 years just trace it from the time
[2:07:03] of abraham
[2:07:04] god hates sin but that very same prophet
[2:07:07] not only lied before his name changed
[2:07:09] but after it not only was he a liar in
[2:07:12] those moments like that but his boy did
[2:07:14] the same thing and guess what that
[2:07:16] followed his family because grandkids
[2:07:17] done the same this grandma's son done
[2:07:19] the same thing
[2:07:20] go back and read your bible
[2:07:22] that was a strain that fear thing that
[2:07:24] followed down through them that
[2:07:26] people-pleasing type thing wanting
[2:07:28] everybody to like them type thing
[2:07:30] getting under pressure and wanting
[2:07:31] people to think that there's somebody or
[2:07:33] something or whatever it may be and
[2:07:35] abraham says
[2:07:36] she's my sister
[2:07:38] he probably thought oh that was a good
[2:07:39] one i can get out of that she's half
[2:07:42] but god knew the nature of his prophet
[2:07:45] so god was not doing this to be mean to
[2:07:48] abraham
[2:07:49] he was training abraham
[2:07:52] he gives a vision to the king that night
[2:07:54] a dream
[2:07:55] and in this dream he tells him you're as
[2:07:57] good as a dead man and the man begins
[2:07:59] arguing with god lord or pleading with
[2:08:01] god lord jesus
[2:08:03] could you imagine what it must be like
[2:08:06] to do something that you think was the
[2:08:08] most honorable thing you could have done
[2:08:09] and almighty god wake you up in the
[2:08:11] middle of the night and say you
[2:08:13] committed a horrible mistake
[2:08:17] but watch god's grace
[2:08:20] did not she tell me did not he tell me
[2:08:23] she was his sister
[2:08:24] do you know the integrity of my heart he
[2:08:26] said i know the integrity of your heart
[2:08:29] that's why i wouldn't permit you to sin
[2:08:30] against me
[2:08:33] but that man is my prophet and you have
[2:08:36] him pray for you
[2:08:38] or your whole nation's gone
[2:08:40] [Music]
[2:08:41] now watch the grace of god was not
[2:08:43] dealing with abraham in an avenue of
[2:08:46] meanness nor cruelty but he knew the
[2:08:49] nature of his very son and he understood
[2:08:51] the weakness that abraham had in that
[2:08:54] family oh god this is as fresh as big
[2:08:56] bread
[2:08:57] amen he understood the weakness that
[2:08:59] laid in that family so what do you make
[2:09:01] abraham do go face it
[2:09:05] cause him right up to the throne room
[2:09:07] you told me a lie
[2:09:11] oh i imagine by this time abraham was
[2:09:12] going uh i i i i i
[2:09:18] i'm the king here
[2:09:20] god woke me up in a dream and told me
[2:09:23] what you did amen
[2:09:25] all right abraham let's see you run now
[2:09:26] boy
[2:09:28] god didn't throw this man in hell
[2:09:30] because he made a mistake god didn't
[2:09:32] persecute him because he made a mistake
[2:09:35] he just trained him how to walk better
[2:09:41] so one year with the lord
[2:09:43] or a thousand years rather is like a day
[2:09:46] and the lord is not slack concerning his
[2:09:48] promise as some men count slackness but
[2:09:51] is
[2:09:52] short-tempered
[2:09:54] mean-spirited
[2:09:55] aggravated impatient
[2:09:59] [Music]
[2:10:01] really
[2:10:03] so you mean he doesn't get mad at us
[2:10:04] over every little thing that goes on
[2:10:08] [Music]
[2:10:10] he is
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:16] amen
[2:10:17] oh listen to us words
[2:10:21] now you see the rest of the world they
[2:10:23] don't have a dog in the fight
[2:10:25] if they're not serving him and they're
[2:10:27] not in the service of the lord then it's
[2:10:29] not really a matter of whether he's long
[2:10:30] suffering or not
[2:10:32] humanity is humanity and they're just
[2:10:34] going to do what they're going to do he
[2:10:35] has no obligation to those that will not
[2:10:37] perform by faith
[2:10:39] right
[2:10:41] he's not willing that really should
[2:10:43] perish and yet in the message we throw
[2:10:45] everybody in hell that don't agree with
[2:10:46] us
[2:10:50] amen
[2:10:52] well i don't like the way that guy
[2:10:53] operates i don't like what he does i
[2:10:55] don't like well maybe he don't like you
[2:10:58] don't ever think on the other side of it
[2:11:00] maybe he don't like you either
[2:11:02] so now you're in a real fix
[2:11:04] huh so what are you going to do well i
[2:11:06] bless him out then he smacks you in the
[2:11:07] mouth then you come back with a baseball
[2:11:09] bat and break his kneecaps then he comes
[2:11:11] back with a with a machete sword and
[2:11:14] cuts your arms off and then that
[2:11:15] grandkid comes by with a tank where does
[2:11:17] it end
[2:11:19] at some point as god's people we have
[2:11:21] got to learn how to forgive and show
[2:11:24] leniency one to another amen
[2:11:28] praise the lord right you can't hold
[2:11:30] hard feelings in your heart toward no
[2:11:32] one and make the rapture a resurrection
[2:11:35] you can't do it friend
[2:11:37] bitterness and having an attitude and
[2:11:39] having those things against people you
[2:11:41] don't like that'll get you kicked out of
[2:11:42] the kingdom quicker than anything you
[2:11:44] can count on one hand
[2:11:48] [Music]
[2:11:49] right
[2:11:50] y'all don't forgot how to say amen can i
[2:11:52] help you okay lower the jaw
[2:11:55] this is called a voiced sound
[2:11:59] a man
[2:12:04] i know you were doing as a voiceless
[2:12:06] sound you know
[2:12:08] i could hear all that going on but you
[2:12:09] need a voice today
[2:12:11] man you got to make your voice box work
[2:12:14] god wants to hear you say it
[2:12:18] boy you can shout at the seals you can
[2:12:20] shout at the thunders shout elijah the
[2:12:22] prophet
[2:12:24] love your brother
[2:12:25] [Music]
[2:12:32] see this is what i'm talking about but
[2:12:34] we put ourselves in such a condition to
[2:12:37] where we feel like god will not be
[2:12:39] lenient with us
[2:12:40] while we're learning
[2:12:42] but if a thousand years is like a day
[2:12:45] then in my 75 year lifetime or 70-year
[2:12:48] lifetime 20 school a three three score
[2:12:51] and ten
[2:12:53] if my lifetime i produce one mistake
[2:12:56] after another but yet the whole time i'm
[2:12:58] trying to serve the lord
[2:12:59] in that 70-year span how much of that
[2:13:01] you think god is keeping a record of and
[2:13:03] saying okay
[2:13:04] this is the 400th time i've had to speak
[2:13:07] with him about that matter
[2:13:09] i've had to speak with this girl 3
[2:13:12] 375 times y'all just don't understand
[2:13:14] the blood of jesus if you got that idea
[2:13:16] because you see when you repent of it
[2:13:18] make it right it goes into the blood you
[2:13:21] are forgiven as though it never happened
[2:13:25] then the next time you do it it's as
[2:13:27] though it was the earth
[2:13:30] first time
[2:13:31] now don't omit the responsibility that
[2:13:34] comes with your mistakes
[2:13:36] if you sow one sin you'll reap a whole
[2:13:38] washtub fool
[2:13:41] right but not because god's trying to be
[2:13:43] mean to you
[2:13:45] but maybe he's trying to teach you a
[2:13:46] lesson
[2:13:47] because he knows how you are
[2:13:50] and he knows how i am
[2:13:55] glory to god
[2:13:57] now watch us in james chapter five verse
[2:14:00] seven
[2:14:01] y'all doing all right so yeah anybody
[2:14:03] need to take a break for a heart pill or
[2:14:05] an insulin shot or blood pressure pill
[2:14:07] or okay
[2:14:08] james five and seven be patient
[2:14:11] therefore brethren
[2:14:15] so who is he talking to
[2:14:17] saints of god
[2:14:19] behold the husband waited for the
[2:14:22] precious fruit of the earth
[2:14:26] boy paul and james and these guys they
[2:14:28] all had a good way of putting things
[2:14:30] didn't they
[2:14:31] and have long
[2:14:34] patience
[2:14:37] so you see the lord jesus is not short
[2:14:40] fused
[2:14:44] even though brother banham said
[2:14:46] sometimes he gets so mad at us he feels
[2:14:48] like kicking us
[2:14:51] that's when we begin to frustrate the
[2:14:53] grace of god do you realize that the
[2:14:55] only time you'll ever get a weapon from
[2:14:56] the lord is when your behavior demands
[2:15:01] that he needs to take care of you
[2:15:05] some people just whip their kids for the
[2:15:06] fun of it
[2:15:07] i think that's one reason they go to
[2:15:08] walmart just to whip their youngins
[2:15:11] it's all you hear all over the whole
[2:15:12] place
[2:15:16] but the very idea of god giving us a
[2:15:18] whipping is not when we're trying to
[2:15:20] walk
[2:15:21] right let us when we refuse to keep
[2:15:23] walking
[2:15:26] or refuse to keep trying
[2:15:29] there's one thing god always hated was a
[2:15:31] quitter
[2:15:34] he loves a hero but he hates a quitter
[2:15:38] [Music]
[2:15:40] amen until he received the early and the
[2:15:43] latter rain now now we're in the seasons
[2:15:45] we're coming up through the road up here
[2:15:46] i was watching they were watering the
[2:15:48] crops and they're about yay high certain
[2:15:49] places around here same in tennessee
[2:15:51] they're starting to come up a little bit
[2:15:53] but could you imagine what it must be
[2:15:56] take a psychologist or somebody that
[2:15:58] understands the human mind and put them
[2:16:00] at the roadside and let that farmer
[2:16:02] plant his first i don't know three or
[2:16:04] four hundred seeds in the ground he's
[2:16:06] got it all tilled up he's got all the
[2:16:07] right nitrogen and things in the ground
[2:16:09] it's exactly as it needs to be and then
[2:16:11] watch him get out there and walk up and
[2:16:13] down after he puts his seeds in and then
[2:16:15] start running up down the road and
[2:16:16] throwing his arms around acting like a
[2:16:18] crazy guy said why are you growing up
[2:16:20] yet
[2:16:22] let some psychologists on the side of
[2:16:23] the road see that happening and they
[2:16:25] will put one of them funny little
[2:16:26] beautiful colored white jackets around
[2:16:28] him that he hugs himself
[2:16:30] and he'll go to a rubber room
[2:16:34] because anybody that knows anything
[2:16:35] about nature
[2:16:37] knows you've got a planet
[2:16:39] and then you got to wait for it
[2:16:43] well look at all them pretty amens
[2:16:45] coming out of your mouth
[2:16:47] but isn't that amazing you'll give grace
[2:16:49] to a seed out here in a in a bunch of a
[2:16:51] bunch of dirt
[2:16:52] but you don't give yourself that mercy
[2:16:56] you throw yourself in hell over a little
[2:16:58] thing that moves well i'm stupid i'm
[2:17:01] dumb and i'm ignorant i'll never amount
[2:17:03] to nothing and who said that about you
[2:17:06] what scripture
[2:17:07] what verse
[2:17:08] where did the prophet teach that
[2:17:10] when the seals come open was that with
[2:17:12] them special revelations i never heard
[2:17:13] about
[2:17:16] no that's us doing that to us
[2:17:20] some message it was communicated from
[2:17:22] mother or father or somebody up the line
[2:17:24] or some uncle or some little experience
[2:17:26] you had that tainted you and left a mark
[2:17:28] on you to make you feel that way but the
[2:17:30] word doesn't talk that way about his
[2:17:33] bride
[2:17:34] amen
[2:17:36] now if you do something stupid the
[2:17:37] preacher looks and said that was the
[2:17:38] stupidest thing he's talking about your
[2:17:39] humanity not your soul
[2:17:41] because humans can be quite dumb
[2:17:44] go ahead and say man just just that'll
[2:17:46] suffice just do that
[2:17:49] we can do the dumbest things on the face
[2:17:50] of life come on preach me a little while
[2:17:52] we can make the most rotten decisions
[2:17:54] that could ever be made we can choose to
[2:17:56] do things to get in the middle of stuff
[2:17:57] we know that we shouldn't have done it
[2:17:59] we did it anyway
[2:18:02] so what does the lord do i just scrap
[2:18:04] the whole thing throw it away it's no
[2:18:06] good
[2:18:08] well it depends on how you respond to
[2:18:10] the correction
[2:18:12] and here's where it gets good y'all just
[2:18:14] letting you know
[2:18:16] if you respond well to the correction
[2:18:19] there's all kinds of grace that comes
[2:18:21] with that
[2:18:22] if you don't respond well to the
[2:18:24] correction
[2:18:25] well then that's another story
[2:18:27] if you've got an attitude or you're
[2:18:29] hard-headed or whatever you are that's
[2:18:30] usually where you start hearing them
[2:18:32] belt loops and heaven go on
[2:18:37] you know sometimes have you been serving
[2:18:38] the lord for a period of time you can
[2:18:40] you feel it when you're about to get it
[2:18:44] you know that you haven't been living
[2:18:45] like you should you know you've been
[2:18:47] fooling around with things and saying
[2:18:49] things or doing things you shouldn't do
[2:18:50] and you could almost feel daddy standing
[2:18:52] in the corner looking around the side of
[2:18:54] the wall i'm going to get you if you
[2:18:56] don't knock it off
[2:18:59] that's right
[2:19:01] but jesus doesn't make us live our lives
[2:19:04] that way we live our life with leniency
[2:19:09] until we frustrate his grace and then he
[2:19:11] deals with us
[2:19:13] i understand god has never ever ever
[2:19:15] ever ever wanted to punish his children
[2:19:17] never that's not in his nature
[2:19:19] punishment doesn't belong to the
[2:19:21] children of god
[2:19:22] correction
[2:19:24] belongs to the children of god
[2:19:26] he didn't say every son that comes to
[2:19:28] god shall be punished first
[2:19:30] no that's a catholic idea
[2:19:33] trying to find peace with god martin
[2:19:34] luther ran around laid in the snow and
[2:19:36] uh froze himself to death and would beat
[2:19:38] himself until he was almost completely
[2:19:40] uh
[2:19:41] drained of all the blood in his body if
[2:19:43] the monks and other people who loved him
[2:19:45] had been standing by that man he'd been
[2:19:46] dead trying to find peace with god
[2:19:48] until one day a revelation hit his heart
[2:19:51] that the just shall live by faith
[2:19:55] hallelujah when god revealed it wasn't
[2:19:57] my faith that keeps me here but the
[2:19:59] faith of god is what keeps me going
[2:20:02] [Music]
[2:20:03] cause there are times i don't have
[2:20:05] enough faith in myself to get to church
[2:20:11] when i lose my faith remember your faith
[2:20:13] has an expiration date on it
[2:20:17] it has a weakness built into it where
[2:20:19] you can only believe god for so long
[2:20:21] and that's where if god ain't living in
[2:20:23] your heart and god's faith ain't living
[2:20:25] in you you'll fizzle out just as sure as
[2:20:26] there's a
[2:20:27] a backslider to be
[2:20:31] now notice paul in 2nd corinthians
[2:20:33] chapter 10 verse 9
[2:20:35] and he said unto me
[2:20:38] my grace is sufficient for thee
[2:20:44] lord my eyes
[2:20:45] but oh lord you know
[2:20:47] please god please paul
[2:20:50] knock it off
[2:20:52] it's not going to hinder your purpose
[2:20:54] i'll see to it
[2:20:56] that you are able to do the job you did
[2:20:58] yeah now while paul was going through
[2:21:00] that i'm sure he was quite grieved
[2:21:02] you know he probably remembers what it
[2:21:03] was like to have good strong eyes and
[2:21:05] could read the the torah and and and
[2:21:07] look at the documents that was written
[2:21:09] by holy men and study the bible and go
[2:21:11] through all the great things of god and
[2:21:13] then he comes to writing the new
[2:21:14] testament
[2:21:16] his whole life is turned upside down
[2:21:19] now he has to write with large letters
[2:21:21] because the swelling would get into his
[2:21:23] eyes
[2:21:24] and he couldn't see well enough to see
[2:21:26] what he was writing
[2:21:29] but he said it was given to me like a
[2:21:30] messenger of satan to buff at me
[2:21:33] [Music]
[2:21:36] god didn't do it to be mean to paul
[2:21:38] he did it because he knew how the man
[2:21:40] was
[2:21:42] he understood his weaknesses
[2:21:45] and he worked with him according to his
[2:21:47] weaknesses did you ever stop to think
[2:21:49] the very thing you cry for god to take
[2:21:51] away from you is the only thing keeping
[2:21:52] you saved yes
[2:21:53] [Music]
[2:21:56] praise god
[2:21:59] some of them things you ask god to take
[2:22:01] away from you that's one of the very
[2:22:02] things that keep you humble and on your
[2:22:04] knees asking god for mercy every day of
[2:22:07] your life
[2:22:09] and the lord is intelligent enough i
[2:22:10] could be so bold to say it this way
[2:22:12] intelligent enough to know if he took it
[2:22:13] away from you you'd be nothing but an
[2:22:15] absolute sludge of goo
[2:22:18] you give up you quit you wouldn't pray
[2:22:20] no more
[2:22:23] oh here come the angels
[2:22:25] not me i'm a believer i will always pray
[2:22:29] i will always yes and you'll always run
[2:22:31] that mouth too won't you till you learn
[2:22:33] your lesson that's right
[2:22:35] [Music]
[2:22:39] amen
[2:22:40] right because we are not as big as we
[2:22:43] think we are
[2:22:45] you let some guy coming out here i mean
[2:22:46] he got muscles bulging out of his
[2:22:48] eyeballs nearly
[2:22:49] you know and just let cancer strike his
[2:22:51] body
[2:22:52] some of these big handsome guys you know
[2:22:54] models and things that walk around tough
[2:22:56] guys can lick up the uh the back end of
[2:22:58] trucks and everything else like that
[2:23:00] and then take him individuals and let
[2:23:02] some things strike his body
[2:23:04] my sister-in-law who's a respiratory
[2:23:06] therapist my brother's wife told me the
[2:23:08] multitude of people that would come
[2:23:09] through in ohio with covet up there
[2:23:11] strong men firefighters and athletes and
[2:23:14] everything else be strong as they can be
[2:23:16] and that disease hit their body and
[2:23:18] within hours some of them are laying
[2:23:20] completely and totally helplessly dead
[2:23:24] so we try to walk around like well glory
[2:23:26] to god
[2:23:28] i'm a believer in this message and then
[2:23:30] amazing how arrogant we've become
[2:23:34] i am a believer not because of my faith
[2:23:37] and not because of my choosing and not
[2:23:40] because i desired it and not because i
[2:23:42] wanted it but i'm a believer because god
[2:23:45] wanted me to be a believer and god had
[2:23:47] confidence in me and god made the choice
[2:23:50] for me come on preach to me now and
[2:23:52] god's the one that'll see fit every hour
[2:23:56] every day every moment of my life to
[2:24:00] make sure i'm living in the faith and
[2:24:02] walking on that road to heaven
[2:24:08] even in the message we put your choice
[2:24:09] your choice let me tell you about your
[2:24:11] choice
[2:24:12] your choice was just enough of an open
[2:24:14] door for god to jam his foot in there
[2:24:17] and take over and do the rest of the
[2:24:19] business
[2:24:20] because this is what your choice looks
[2:24:22] like we come here after church uh where
[2:24:24] would you all like to go eat let's go
[2:24:25] eat mexican i ain't gonna eat mexican i
[2:24:27] want chinese i've ate mexican four days
[2:24:29] this week i don't want chinese i've been
[2:24:31] eating chinese for lunch ever i want to
[2:24:32] have this i want to get some fufu
[2:24:36] [Music]
[2:24:37] before you get to the front door of the
[2:24:40] restaurant you want to go to you've done
[2:24:42] changed your mind and made a different
[2:24:45] choice ah somebody preached to me
[2:24:48] your choices i have enough power in it
[2:24:51] to keep you safe
[2:24:54] god is the one that did the choosing for
[2:24:56] me god is the one that brought me into
[2:24:59] this
[2:25:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:25:03] and without his grace without his mercy
[2:25:06] i would never survive another day of my
[2:25:07] life
[2:25:12] most gladly therefore paul said i will
[2:25:16] glory
[2:25:17] in my infirmities
[2:25:20] yes
[2:25:22] i'll take pleasure in reproaches
[2:25:25] in necessities
[2:25:27] in persecution in distresses
[2:25:30] for christ's sake
[2:25:33] for when i am weak
[2:25:35] then i am strong
[2:25:39] hallelujah and praise the lord
[2:25:42] it proves something to us
[2:25:44] it proves that we're not as smart as we
[2:25:46] think we are
[2:25:48] you see friends this is where saul got
[2:25:50] to this is why the anointing left this
[2:25:51] man
[2:25:52] the bible said he got big in his own
[2:25:54] sight
[2:25:56] he got to thinking look at my kingdom
[2:25:58] that's what happened to nebuchadnezzar
[2:26:00] nebuchadnezzar was a tool in the hand of
[2:26:02] god the prophet said he actually had a
[2:26:04] very soft heart that god could deal with
[2:26:07] and the lord anointed this man to put
[2:26:09] israel in bondage as a tool to make them
[2:26:12] pay for the rejection of christ's word
[2:26:14] remember when they were laying
[2:26:15] underneath every green tree playing the
[2:26:17] part of a harlot that he had to put him
[2:26:19] away in divorce and he set him out there
[2:26:21] for 70 years and nebuchadnezzar standing
[2:26:23] on the bow amen on the landscape looking
[2:26:26] across his kingdom he became uplifted
[2:26:29] and thought i've done some big stuff
[2:26:31] around here
[2:26:33] and the lord said
[2:26:34] you have have you
[2:26:36] well let's see how big you are when your
[2:26:38] nails are grown out like a
[2:26:41] and your hair is grown out like a
[2:26:44] and you're down with the rest of the
[2:26:47] i'll just let you fill in the blanks
[2:26:48] there because we've all been in them
[2:26:49] places that's right
[2:26:51] right
[2:26:53] the moment we begin to think that we can
[2:26:56] accomplish anything at all that's the
[2:26:59] moment you start backsliding
[2:27:04] hey man
[2:27:06] oh i hope this is all right brother here
[2:27:08] i am
[2:27:10] i'm not trying to meddle you have a job
[2:27:12] i have a job but i'm just preaching
[2:27:14] you're no different from anybody else
[2:27:15] i've been preaching this everywhere i go
[2:27:17] because i think the people of god need
[2:27:18] to hear these kind of sermons like this
[2:27:20] would you agree with me
[2:27:22] [Music]
[2:27:22] [Applause]
[2:27:24] praise the lord jesus
[2:27:26] amen i've got to burn i want to i want
[2:27:28] our young men and women to understand
[2:27:30] that this message is more than a rule
[2:27:32] book we follow
[2:27:33] it's a life it's a lifestyle
[2:27:36] and let me tell you if the gays and all
[2:27:37] the rest of them can have their
[2:27:38] lifestyle so can the bride of jesus
[2:27:41] christ have a lifestyle of service to
[2:27:44] the lord
[2:27:45] amen a life to live for jesus christ a
[2:27:48] life to live in the presence of god
[2:27:52] amen it's not just my ritual to read the
[2:27:54] bible i do it because it's a part of my
[2:27:55] lifestyle
[2:27:58] amen
[2:28:00] listen to this at the message adoption
[2:28:01] now the prophet says
[2:28:03] how can you preach predestination of god
[2:28:07] for ordaining
[2:28:08] and setting now this is an old country
[2:28:10] expression meaning positioning of the
[2:28:12] bride uh like an old hen will set and
[2:28:15] they'll say well what's the hint she's
[2:28:16] setting
[2:28:18] brother i'm using this for the for the
[2:28:20] position of the bride the foundation the
[2:28:22] forward running excuse me the
[2:28:23] predestination and the setting of the
[2:28:25] position unless there's a sin atonement
[2:28:28] somewhere
[2:28:30] so folks run around you got to know your
[2:28:32] position you got to know you're the
[2:28:33] bride you've got to find your place how
[2:28:35] can you preach that
[2:28:36] and not preach the sin atonement that
[2:28:38] goes with that because the very people
[2:28:41] we hear being preached to in this day
[2:28:43] and every message they preach is one of
[2:28:45] these big one-liners you're the bride
[2:28:47] you're the elect you're going in the
[2:28:48] rapture them very same people they're
[2:28:50] preaching to many times winds up in my
[2:28:52] meeting a month later and they're even
[2:28:53] more defeated than they was when they
[2:28:55] were shouting and running these other
[2:28:56] big campaigns
[2:28:58] you know why because when the dust
[2:28:59] settled down they found out they were
[2:29:01] still a human being that needed training
[2:29:04] on how to be a christian
[2:29:06] that's right me screaming up here to you
[2:29:07] you're the bride i know your position
[2:29:08] know how you that doesn't help you get
[2:29:10] there i've got to train you as a
[2:29:12] god-called man to show you how to live
[2:29:14] that life
[2:29:16] you say ain't none of your business i'll
[2:29:18] have you know the prophet of god sending
[2:29:19] spoken words original seed that you can
[2:29:21] only serve god as god's servants
[2:29:24] interpret the word to you
[2:29:26] so yes sir i have a responsibility as a
[2:29:28] ministry i have a responsibility as a
[2:29:31] god-called man to teach the people how
[2:29:33] to become the kind of people that can
[2:29:35] serve the lord when they don't feel it
[2:29:37] inside the lord when all the chips are
[2:29:39] down and silent when everything is
[2:29:42] looking bleak
[2:29:44] we need that
[2:29:46] great emotional campaigns and getting
[2:29:48] people to an altar and shouting and
[2:29:49] screaming and falling in the floor that
[2:29:51] is wonderful it serves a purpose but
[2:29:54] when your feet hit them floor and you
[2:29:56] the floor and you are face to face with
[2:29:58] the devil you better have more than a
[2:30:00] chill down your back to know how to make
[2:30:01] that kind of life
[2:30:08] but it says why is it each day
[2:30:11] you make a mistake
[2:30:14] each day
[2:30:16] you do wrong
[2:30:19] now for all of you of an angelic quality
[2:30:21] here this morning
[2:30:23] i dismiss you from the rest of these
[2:30:24] quotes
[2:30:25] and all the humans that would like to
[2:30:27] remain
[2:30:28] please stay put for the rest of the
[2:30:30] story
[2:30:33] amen
[2:30:35] i'd have stood up too but i'm standing
[2:30:39] oh i am standing so i guess that counts
[2:30:40] too don't
[2:30:41] notice brother man says but if you're
[2:30:44] born again a man or woman as soon as you
[2:30:47] make that mistake
[2:30:50] god knows you're sorry for it
[2:30:55] you know he doesn't even wait for you to
[2:30:56] say you're sorry not according to this
[2:30:58] quote here
[2:30:59] the moment you do the wrong that moment
[2:31:02] god already knows you're sorry for it
[2:31:06] now if he is the word hebrews 4 12 a
[2:31:08] deserter of the thoughts and the intents
[2:31:10] of the heart
[2:31:11] not only does he know my thoughts about
[2:31:13] matters and how i'm thinking and the
[2:31:15] confusions and the complexes and the
[2:31:17] fears and all that goes with those
[2:31:19] things the positives and whatever more
[2:31:20] might be associated but he also knows my
[2:31:23] intention
[2:31:26] he knows that that certain thing may
[2:31:28] pull on my flesh and i may be weak to
[2:31:30] that and in a certain period of time as
[2:31:32] a human i may even want to do that but
[2:31:35] the intention of my heart is god i want
[2:31:37] to be right
[2:31:38] god i want to get victory over that i
[2:31:40] want to find a way that i can get
[2:31:42] liberty from it and god knows the
[2:31:45] intention of your heart
[2:31:49] amen the moment you say i am sorry god
[2:31:53] already knew
[2:31:55] that you were sorry for the thing that
[2:31:57] you were talking about
[2:32:02] you notice he says that sins s-i-n-s a
[2:32:05] sinner is a sinner he does not commit
[2:32:08] sins
[2:32:10] but the church commits sin
[2:32:15] now some of y'all wouldn't say it when i
[2:32:17] said it now brother branham's saying it
[2:32:18] so where are you at now
[2:32:21] i can't be a message believer you'll be
[2:32:23] able to say man to this quote
[2:32:25] the church commits sins
[2:32:28] i'm looking for a bride without spot or
[2:32:30] wrinkle and how does she get there

[2:33:08] throne under the fountain of god's blood

[2:33:14] been full of the blessing and the
[2:33:19] thank you cleansing

[2:33:46] little things like i don't just get it
[2:33:47] all over and get to the punch line oh no
[2:33:49] no no no and here's where the good
[2:33:51] eating's at i'm not getting past that to
[2:33:52] that scarecrow
[2:33:54] this is where we are so defeated
[2:33:59] you look at your life even this morning
[2:34:00] some of you may be looking in the mirror
[2:34:01] and thinking i am the worst
[2:34:04] i can never do anything right i just
[2:34:05] mess everything up i touch
[2:34:08] how does god feel about you though
[2:34:10] right has anybody this morning received
[2:34:13] a sickness unto death
[2:34:15] because of your behavior anybody an
[2:34:17] angel of the lord come to you this
[2:34:19] morning and strike you on the head with
[2:34:20] a sword and say i'm done with you
[2:34:24] no has the lord stepped into your living
[2:34:26] room
[2:34:27] pointed his finger in your face and
[2:34:29] looked at you in your beady little eyes
[2:34:30] and said you are done i'm done with you
[2:34:32] i want nothing else to do anybody your
[2:34:34] liberty to speak
[2:34:36] really
[2:34:38] how many of you prayed to him this
[2:34:39] morning i asked him to help you
[2:34:42] did you what was the answer what was the
[2:34:44] message i forget it
[2:34:49] huh
[2:34:50] you mean the lord
[2:34:52] is still just listening
[2:34:55] and
[2:34:56] monitoring and paying attention
[2:35:02] hallelujah
[2:35:05] why does he shine
[2:35:10] he's giving you an opportunity to figure
[2:35:12] it out
[2:35:14] do you ever notice that the first time
[2:35:16] you do something wrong as a new
[2:35:17] christian it's like this church is
[2:35:19] sitting on your heart
[2:35:22] you feel so bad about it it just grieves
[2:35:24] you so deeply but then the next time it
[2:35:27] comes around it ain't like that
[2:35:30] and many times you'll look back on your
[2:35:32] life the very first things that god
[2:35:34] checked you on
[2:35:35] and made you feel that way those things
[2:35:37] have repeated themselves in your life
[2:35:39] but you haven't felt it that same way
[2:35:42] do you know why because he made his will
[2:35:44] known to you in the beginning that that
[2:35:46] wasn't pleasing to him and then he took
[2:35:48] the ball and pitched it to you and said
[2:35:50] your turn
[2:35:53] now you figure it out
[2:35:57] amen y'all have an amen tape made up in
[2:36:00] this church for moments like this
[2:36:04] feel free to press play and obey
[2:36:09] i know i'm a smart like i know
[2:36:12] i know
[2:36:14] i don't mean to be a smart like but i
[2:36:15] guess i am sometimes
[2:36:17] but watch us the church commits sin does
[2:36:19] wrong gets the wrong thought makes a
[2:36:21] wrong impression
[2:36:23] have you ever got the wrong impression
[2:36:24] about someone
[2:36:26] somebody tell you a bunch of stuff about
[2:36:27] this or that or somebody say or maybe
[2:36:30] maybe somebody having a bad day and they
[2:36:31] just acted a little off and then you got
[2:36:33] a wrong impression about them
[2:36:35] this person could turn out to be your
[2:36:36] absolute best friend in the whole wide
[2:36:38] world but you as a human allowed
[2:36:40] something to penetrate your mind that
[2:36:42] give you the wrong impression about the
[2:36:44] person
[2:36:45] that's amazing me as a preacher people
[2:36:47] tell me things all the time about you
[2:36:49] know i never thought you were like this
[2:36:51] i never dreamed you was easy going i
[2:36:52] listened to you preach i never dreamed
[2:36:54] you was as carefree as you are
[2:36:57] some people look at me they don't think
[2:36:58] i know how to laugh
[2:37:00] because they hear me preach and i'm
[2:37:02] taking that sword cut and coming and
[2:37:03] going and then they tell a joke i've
[2:37:05] literally had him apologize for telling
[2:37:07] a joke in my presence what are you
[2:37:08] apologizing for
[2:37:10] well you're a servant of god i'm not
[2:37:11] going to kill you for it
[2:37:13] i'm going to laugh at i thought it was
[2:37:14] funny
[2:37:15] what is that wrong impressions
[2:37:19] and they never pick up the phone to call
[2:37:20] you and tell you what they're thinking
[2:37:22] they never say you know brother we need
[2:37:24] to discuss her sister we need to talk
[2:37:26] about uh sir i'm just been battling and
[2:37:29] i they never do that right you ever
[2:37:31] notice that but everybody knows how to
[2:37:33] put it on facebook
[2:37:36] somehow it always leaks you know it
[2:37:38] leeches into the instagram posts and
[2:37:40] into their tick tocks
[2:37:45] amen
[2:37:47] but that's human beings
[2:37:49] brother and said they make scruples
[2:37:52] wobbles
[2:37:54] now i'm sure in africa they don't use
[2:37:56] this terminology but that just basically
[2:37:57] means that you don't how you're not
[2:37:59] walking correctly
[2:38:01] this is old kentucky english right here
[2:38:03] i'm sure
[2:38:05] like a little child walking
[2:38:08] trying to learn how to walk
[2:38:10] he just don't know how to walk good yet
[2:38:13] right
[2:38:14] because he's a little boy
[2:38:16] but we have a hand that reaches down
[2:38:19] glory to god and gets us and studies us
[2:38:21] and says make the step this away son
[2:38:24] he doesn't pick us up and spank us
[2:38:28] because we've made a mistake
[2:38:31] he doesn't beat us to death
[2:38:33] because we're trying to walk
[2:38:36] he loves us like
[2:38:38] we love
[2:38:40] our children
[2:38:42] now you take some of these little kids
[2:38:45] like you take when my jessica was a baby
[2:38:46] and she was learning how to walk and
[2:38:48] she'd wobble and stumble and
[2:38:51] crash and burn
[2:38:53] now if i'm a real daddy i don't look at
[2:38:54] that baby so you are the stupidest baby
[2:38:56] i've ever laid my eyes on
[2:38:59] you are the dumbest kid i've ever met
[2:39:03] watch her out or get up off the floor
[2:39:05] and walk she can't
[2:39:07] right she don't have enough strength
[2:39:11] she don't have enough skill
[2:39:13] she don't have enough mental prowess or
[2:39:15] ability
[2:39:17] to get them legs to match what she's
[2:39:19] hearing daddy say
[2:39:21] oh glory to god
[2:39:23] so if he's a real daddy if he's a real
[2:39:25] father hey man he just grabs that little
[2:39:27] kid by the hand picks her up or picks
[2:39:29] him up and says try it again
[2:39:38] this is what i'm preaching to you
[2:39:40] leniency
[2:39:42] [Music]
[2:39:43] [Applause]
[2:39:44] he doesn't look at you and say why
[2:39:47] didn't you get it right the first time
[2:39:50] he lets you work on it until you get it
[2:39:54] and according to the bible here he has
[2:39:56] long patience waiting to watch you get
[2:39:58] it
[2:39:59] friends if we can really see it the way
[2:40:01] jesus looks at it he's actually like a
[2:40:03] parent you know when they see that kid
[2:40:04] beginning to walk parents get so excited
[2:40:07] i know some of you young people are not
[2:40:08] going to understand i'm getting ready to
[2:40:09] speak foreign tongues to you okay but we
[2:40:12] used to get polaroids
[2:40:14] not a thing not clueless
[2:40:18] [Music]
[2:40:19] we used to get our our our our our video
[2:40:21] cameras out and back then they were
[2:40:23] about as big as that box and this
[2:40:24] speaker up there
[2:40:26] get the tape we'd slap the tape in that
[2:40:28] video camera and we started watching
[2:40:30] look at him now take the step junior
[2:40:32] take the step and the whole video when
[2:40:34] you look back on it is this crazy little
[2:40:36] kid falling down every five seconds and
[2:40:39] mama going come on now do it again do it
[2:40:41] again
[2:40:43] if we can only see what jesus
[2:40:46] says he doesn't look down on you he
[2:40:49] doesn't disgrace you or feel
[2:40:52] disappointed in you but the lord jesus
[2:40:55] christ is on the other end of the camera
[2:40:58] he's egging you on cheering you on come
[2:41:01] on you can do it
[2:41:03] come on john you can do it come on sir
[2:41:06] you can do it
[2:41:08] daddy has got confidence in you
[2:41:12] [Applause]
[2:41:14] amen because you're made of the same
[2:41:16] material i made up and if i can walk you
[2:41:20] can do it too
[2:41:21] [Music]
[2:41:21] [Applause]
[2:41:24] praise god
[2:41:27] oh
[2:41:28] no wonder jesus said the works that i do
[2:41:31] shall you do also
[2:41:36] but if he falls down
[2:41:39] he doesn't look at him and say you are
[2:41:41] the dumbest kid
[2:41:43] what is a matter with you
[2:41:46] you've seen your mother and i walked for
[2:41:47] two years now
[2:41:50] [Music]
[2:41:52] you see how we are with people
[2:41:55] we don't display the patience
[2:41:58] of jesus christ
[2:42:00] forget about brotherly kindness we're
[2:42:01] not even on the radar yet
[2:42:03] we need to come to the place of having
[2:42:05] godly patience one for another
[2:42:08] come on say amen
[2:42:10] don't get quiet on me say amen we need
[2:42:12] to have god's patience one for another
[2:42:15] have patience with him patience with his
[2:42:17] word and
[2:42:19] and
[2:42:20] patience with ourselves
[2:42:26] whether you like this or not you are
[2:42:27] your own worst critic
[2:42:30] [Music]
[2:42:32] that's why the devil has really had an
[2:42:33] easy job in lady ocean
[2:42:35] he's planted all the seeds he needs to
[2:42:37] to plant and everything's just cruising
[2:42:39] along and it's just kind of one of them
[2:42:41] self-contained situations you know but
[2:42:43] when it comes to you he don't even have
[2:42:45] to fight you half the time because all
[2:42:47] he knows he has to do is drop the idea
[2:42:49] in your mind and you'll take the ball
[2:42:50] and run with it the rest of the day
[2:42:54] remember when you're done that's all he
[2:42:55] has to say
[2:42:57] and you'll spend the rest of the day
[2:42:59] yeah i remember oh i remember what i was
[2:43:01] i remember do you ever stop to think
[2:43:03] when you're doing all that and stop to
[2:43:04] say yeah but you know what
[2:43:06] i've done that thing 10 000 times yet
[2:43:08] here i am
[2:43:09] right here
[2:43:11] it didn't kill me it didn't take me out
[2:43:13] i'm still going i'm still breathing i
[2:43:15] still got a heartbeat
[2:43:17] and the lord ain't hit me with a
[2:43:18] lightning bolt right right between my
[2:43:20] eyes
[2:43:22] i smell no smoke i feel no flames
[2:43:26] i went to church and i felt the grace of
[2:43:28] god come through the message
[2:43:30] i sang them songs and felt god's mercy
[2:43:33] hallelujah falling pressure on me
[2:43:37] amen
[2:43:40] again the prophet of god said
[2:43:42] a real daddy wouldn't whip his child
[2:43:45] when he's trying to walk
[2:43:47] he falls down on the floor he just
[2:43:49] reaches down with a big strong hand
[2:43:50] picks him up takes both hands a hold of
[2:43:52] him old and new testament and says this
[2:43:54] is the way you do it son walk like this
[2:43:58] oh praise song
[2:44:00] oh you say well walking ain't that
[2:44:02] important enoch thought it was right
[2:44:04] that's right
[2:44:06] and god thought walking was pretty
[2:44:07] important with him
[2:44:09] i also thought walking was pretty
[2:44:10] important with the children of israel
[2:44:11] they've done it for 40 years
[2:44:13] he also thought it was important with
[2:44:14] abraham he said every place the soul of
[2:44:16] your foot shall tread i bless that and
[2:44:18] you're coming in i'll bless it and
[2:44:20] you're going out he said the same thing
[2:44:22] amen when he comes all the way up to the
[2:44:24] 20th century and there's brother braddon
[2:44:26] after he spoke to that storm and god
[2:44:28] said you want to walk with me
[2:44:32] amen walking must have been pretty
[2:44:34] important whenever he called to peter
[2:44:36] lord if it be you let me walk on the
[2:44:39] water
[2:44:41] how about to that woman that saw brother
[2:44:42] bradham go into the building if i could
[2:44:44] just walk in his footsteps i know that
[2:44:47] i'll be healed hallelujah
[2:44:50] walking is quite important at least the
[2:44:52] children of jezreel and jericho thought
[2:44:54] so
[2:44:55] hallelujah
[2:45:00] the most important thing in your entire
[2:45:02] existence with jesus christ is your walk
[2:45:05] with god
[2:45:10] in that same book of ephesians where he
[2:45:11] said we are caught up in heavenly places
[2:45:13] in christ jesus also said we are
[2:45:15] predestinated in him to a holy walk
[2:45:24] now in question's answer is 1961 can i
[2:45:27] get a little bit more of your time
[2:45:29] thank you i was going to take it anyways
[2:45:31] but i thought i'd be gentleman enough to
[2:45:32] ask first
[2:45:34] thank you for your pity
[2:45:37] amen now watch this and questions and
[2:45:39] answers
[2:45:40] brother batman is dealing with the gifts
[2:45:41] of the spirit coming back into the
[2:45:42] church now for you that study the
[2:45:44] message you'll actually be able to trace
[2:45:46] this out this is the second time in the
[2:45:49] tabernacle's history that brother
[2:45:51] branham is dealing with the gifts the
[2:45:52] first is a very silent matter we don't
[2:45:54] have any record of it and evidently at
[2:45:56] one time maybe back in the 40s 50s
[2:45:58] everyone it was brother brown had
[2:46:00] already established the gifts in the
[2:46:01] church
[2:46:02] but now because of the new ministry and
[2:46:04] the evangelism and things that are
[2:46:05] coming on the gifts are beginning to
[2:46:07] cycle back into branham tabernacle so
[2:46:09] then they're asking brother branham
[2:46:10] about the ones that are hidden and
[2:46:12] missing and it's false and it's in air
[2:46:14] and then it's true and then it's god and
[2:46:15] then it's right
[2:46:17] and they're asking him well when
[2:46:19] somebody prophesies or speaks in tongues
[2:46:21] interprets he said could that be the god
[2:46:23] could that be the lord could that be god
[2:46:25] he answers this way now sometimes it
[2:46:28] could be god
[2:46:29] and he said and those little fellows
[2:46:31] he's talking about the people in the
[2:46:32] tabernacle using these gifts
[2:46:33] they're just like a little kid trying to
[2:46:36] walk
[2:46:37] now if he falls down four or five times
[2:46:43] well when it comes to your brother
[2:46:44] seventy times seven in one day
[2:46:47] any mathematicians in here
[2:46:49] would you like to take 70 times seven
[2:46:51] and then do that times 364 days
[2:46:56] that goes to prove what kind of patience
[2:46:58] the bride's gonna have to have
[2:47:02] you're gonna have to be way more patient
[2:47:04] than what you are
[2:47:05] way more lenient than what you are
[2:47:08] amen praise the lord
[2:47:11] brother said now i've seen it since i've
[2:47:13] been here at this church and and well
[2:47:16] i'll i'll just leave it like that
[2:47:20] i only wish brother bannon would have
[2:47:22] been a little had a little bit more
[2:47:23] liberty to speak what was going on at
[2:47:25] the tabernacle that he saw
[2:47:27] i'd just be nosy just to be nosy not to
[2:47:29] be spiritual i would have liked to know
[2:47:31] what he saw
[2:47:34] because you know to me i'm sure it was
[2:47:36] the same old stuff like we see today
[2:47:38] a bunch of human beings doing the same
[2:47:40] thing human beings have always done in a
[2:47:41] human way
[2:47:43] humanly speaking
[2:47:47] he says now i'll just leave it like that
[2:47:49] but you see but what of it would you say
[2:47:51] then brother branham why didn't you
[2:47:54] correct this
[2:47:56] sure
[2:47:58] no no
[2:48:03] you mean to tell me the prophet of god
[2:48:07] saw error in the church
[2:48:10] and didn't correct it right away
[2:48:12] sure wow this was a smart man because he
[2:48:16] understood the benefit
[2:48:18] of giving people
[2:48:20] leniency
[2:48:26] even if you don't have them
[2:48:28] you can always borrow an amen from your
[2:48:30] neighbor if you need it
[2:48:38] now we're so you know hyper spiritual
[2:48:40] about everything right
[2:48:42] somebody comes on the platform they
[2:48:43] better look the part act apart what
[2:48:45] would you do with the statement when
[2:48:47] brother brandon's got a woman sitting on
[2:48:48] his piano with a short dress cut hair
[2:48:50] and makeup on her face and they're
[2:48:52] tearing brother brown to pieces about it
[2:48:54] and the prophet answered that jess about
[2:48:57] she's gone tonight
[2:48:59] you know what he said
[2:49:01] leave her alone
[2:49:02] she's a baby in christ
[2:49:08] [Music]
[2:49:10] shall i go a little bit further thank
[2:49:12] you
[2:49:14] there's a man in christiansburg virginia
[2:49:16] his name is ernest fulcher
[2:49:19] brother fulcher's wife is going to be
[2:49:21] the lord now sister marverine now if you
[2:49:23] don't know who brother folter is he's
[2:49:25] barry coffey's father-in-law becky
[2:49:27] coffee his wife this is her mother and
[2:49:29] father
[2:49:30] now back in the old days when the tent
[2:49:32] revivals were going on brother fulcher
[2:49:33] was a big deal him billy andrews and a
[2:49:36] bunch of those others that you'll hear
[2:49:37] if you go down south they had tents that
[2:49:39] sometimes would go 10 15 20 000 people
[2:49:42] in a night
[2:49:44] 70 80 nights in a row in pentecost
[2:49:47] and at certain points the message had
[2:49:49] crossed their path sister marvariem was
[2:49:51] the one that heard it first
[2:49:54] she was in such a relationship with
[2:49:56] those at the branham tabernacle that doc
[2:49:58] branham brother branham's brother they
[2:50:00] called him doc
[2:50:01] doc would keep a folding chair in a
[2:50:03] closet just for sister marverine to have
[2:50:06] a spot when she come to the tabernacle
[2:50:07] and it was overrun because she'd be on
[2:50:10] the field with her husband and when she
[2:50:12] catch a spot
[2:50:13] to slide down to the tabernacle she
[2:50:15] could never get there in the right
[2:50:16] amount of time because at that time
[2:50:17] brother ernest wasn't following the
[2:50:18] message and she needed a way to get and
[2:50:21] brother doc always made a point of
[2:50:22] keeping a chair in there just for her
[2:50:25] well it was a long about i forget the
[2:50:27] exact date but it was along about the
[2:50:29] time that they were really beginning to
[2:50:30] get into the message
[2:50:32] that she wrote brother branham a letter
[2:50:34] and in this letter she asked brother
[2:50:36] brandon brother branham my husband is an
[2:50:39] evangelist who preaches
[2:50:40] and i've heard your message about where
[2:50:42] women belong
[2:50:44] and not in the pulpit
[2:50:46] but we have no trusty song leader so i
[2:50:49] she was an organ player and a good one
[2:50:51] god anoint these hands to play like
[2:50:52] sister marverine my goodness that woman
[2:50:54] could play
[2:50:56] and i would say
[2:50:57] she'd say now i'm i'm playing for my
[2:51:00] husband and i'm leading singing
[2:51:02] but brother branham i feel so condemned
[2:51:04] about this because i heard what you said
[2:51:07] about a woman in the platform
[2:51:09] i saw the letter with my own eyes and if
[2:51:11] i'm telling you wrong then i'll meet it
[2:51:13] at judgment but let me tell you and
[2:51:14] share with you what i read
[2:51:16] sister marverine sister fulcher
[2:51:19] brother batman said for the time being
[2:51:22] because there is a need
[2:51:25] it doesn't hurt anything for you to lead
[2:51:27] singing for your husband
[2:51:29] because the bible said you wasn't
[2:51:31] allowed to preach but it doesn't say
[2:51:33] anything about singing
[2:51:36] now it would be better brother adam said
[2:51:38] if a man was leading it because of what
[2:51:40] we know from scripture
[2:51:42] but otherwise i have no scripture
[2:51:44] against it
[2:51:47] so continue until the lord sees fit to
[2:51:50] provide another way
[2:51:52] now here we go
[2:51:54] what if you were to come to church this
[2:51:55] morning
[2:51:56] and faith would have been your song
[2:51:58] leader
[2:52:01] oh
[2:52:03] or any other woman for that matter don't
[2:52:04] have to be just sister faith could be
[2:52:06] that sister or this sister here or the
[2:52:08] ones that sang them great songs that
[2:52:10] choir up here what if all the women come
[2:52:12] up here and decided let's have a song
[2:52:13] leading choir
[2:52:15] what would some of you brothers in this
[2:52:17] church do
[2:52:19] you would get on that table app so fast
[2:52:22] the computer memory and speed could not
[2:52:25] keep up your tablet would not be fast
[2:52:27] enough to keep up with you pounding out
[2:52:30] quotes about a one inch place
[2:52:33] but you see in certain situations we
[2:52:36] need to practice leniency
[2:52:39] rather
[2:52:40] than hypocrisy
[2:52:47] well hallelujah
[2:52:51] amen
[2:52:52] [Applause]
[2:52:56] right now again as i told you before i
[2:52:58] started this don't think that i'm saying
[2:53:00] you don't have to live right don't think
[2:53:01] i'm giving you a license do whatever you
[2:53:03] want to do
[2:53:04] if that's in your heart you need a holy
[2:53:06] ghost
[2:53:07] but friends there needs to be an element
[2:53:10] of leniency for us to serve god without
[2:53:12] total complete everyday condemning and
[2:53:15] condemnation and every step we take
[2:53:17] living in misery
[2:53:20] because we think god's gonna throw us in
[2:53:21] hell at any moment can i share something
[2:53:23] with you
[2:53:24] i've got the holy ghost
[2:53:26] i am born again
[2:53:28] it is impossible
[2:53:31] for god to send me to hell
[2:53:38] [Applause]
[2:53:41] i'm just waiting till that translates
[2:53:47] if you've got the holy ghost if you are
[2:53:49] born again
[2:53:51] amen hallelujah
[2:53:53] it is impossible
[2:53:57] for god to ever send you to hell
[2:54:01] do you realize with that little piece of
[2:54:02] god inside of you to send you to hell
[2:54:05] would be like sending him to hell
[2:54:11] hallelujah
[2:54:14] he can't send himself to hell no more
[2:54:17] than he can send you
[2:54:21] you that are born again of the holy
[2:54:23] ghost
[2:54:24] it's impossible to send you to a place
[2:54:26] that is not your heavenly home
[2:54:30] amen even the prophet of god sent
[2:54:31] questions and answers that those that
[2:54:33] have a real eternal life in their heart
[2:54:35] he said they're only reflecting the
[2:54:36] inheritance that's waiting over there
[2:54:39] if you're wicked indifferent he said if
[2:54:41] you've got hate in your heart he said
[2:54:43] you're reflecting that dimension over
[2:54:45] there but if i am born again of the holy
[2:54:48] ghost
[2:54:49] i am only reflecting
[2:54:51] what's waiting for me on the other side
[2:54:54] i can't go to hell it's impossible
[2:55:00] [Music]
[2:55:02] so this fear
[2:55:04] that all of a sudden the other shoe is
[2:55:05] going to drop
[2:55:07] you need liberty from that right now
[2:55:09] [Music]
[2:55:11] i said you need deliverance from that
[2:55:13] right now
[2:55:18] listen to this brethren says
[2:55:20] but you see why didn't you correct it
[2:55:22] brother brahma no no
[2:55:24] when billy paul back there first started
[2:55:26] to walk
[2:55:28] he was up and down and down more than he
[2:55:30] was up
[2:55:31] well that sounds more like me than
[2:55:34] any other quote i can read
[2:55:36] he didn't know how to walk
[2:55:38] but i believed he had a gift of walking
[2:55:42] [Music]
[2:55:44] [Applause]
[2:55:48] and people think brother didn't know
[2:55:49] what he was talking about some ignoramus
[2:55:51] didn't know how to put things
[2:55:54] all the wisdom in what we're hearing he
[2:55:56] said so i would let him walk a little
[2:55:58] while
[2:55:59] but when he got to stumbling those big
[2:56:01] feet
[2:56:02] then i would tell him about it see what
[2:56:04] i mean he'd go along looking at
[2:56:06] something else popping or some kind of
[2:56:08] thing like chewing gum and he said oh my
[2:56:10] i'd say pick up your feet boy where are
[2:56:13] you at
[2:56:14] right
[2:56:14] that's the difference
[2:56:16] right
[2:56:17] so when you don't know how to do it god
[2:56:19] shows you leniency
[2:56:21] when you do know how to do it he'll tan
[2:56:23] your hide
[2:56:26] that's the difference
[2:56:28] so that's why people oh i'm pretty sure
[2:56:30] i can live any way i want to live if
[2:56:32] you're a child of god i triple dog dare
[2:56:35] you to try it
[2:56:38] [Music]
[2:56:40] if you are god's child and you try to
[2:56:41] that arrogant attitude you just watch
[2:56:43] and see you'll hear that thing i said
[2:56:45] after that
[2:56:48] y'all know what that is don't you that's
[2:56:49] daddy's belt pop pop pop going through
[2:56:51] the belt loops
[2:56:56] friends he loves us so much he won't let
[2:56:58] us get away with an arrogant attitude
[2:57:03] amen and amen
[2:57:05] look here in st luke chapter 7 verse 19.
[2:57:08] john calling two of his disciples sent
[2:57:11] them to jesus saying art thou he that
[2:57:12] should come or look we for another
[2:57:15] when the men were come they said john
[2:57:16] the baptist has sent us unto thee
[2:57:18] saying art thou he that should come or
[2:57:20] look we for another
[2:57:22] and that same hour he cured many of
[2:57:24] their infirmities plagues evil spirits
[2:57:26] many that were blind gave sight
[2:57:28] jesus answered said go your way and tell
[2:57:30] john
[2:57:32] what things you have seen and heard
[2:57:34] how the blinds see the lame walk the
[2:57:36] lepers cleanse the deaf hear the dead
[2:57:38] raised and the poor the gospel is
[2:57:40] preached you ever noticed jesus always
[2:57:41] preached to the poor why do message
[2:57:42] preachers all want to preach the rich
[2:57:46] bigger offerings i guess i get maybe
[2:57:47] that's the reason
[2:57:49] amen anyhow
[2:57:50] but notice now here brother bam is
[2:57:52] telling us a message called it wasn't so
[2:57:54] from the beginning
[2:57:55] he said now notice john's eagle eye had
[2:57:58] gotten filmed over
[2:58:01] he was in prison because of this great
[2:58:03] marriage and divorce case that he was up
[2:58:05] against
[2:58:06] he had taken a stand for the word it was
[2:58:08] going to cost him his head
[2:58:11] but while he's in prison the anointing
[2:58:13] for introducing the messiah has now
[2:58:15] lifted off of him
[2:58:20] and while he's in prison now that human
[2:58:22] part begins to kick in
[2:58:25] oh did i make a mistake did i do
[2:58:26] something wrong did i miss this
[2:58:29] sure
[2:58:30] this is where i got the me the title for
[2:58:32] this message brother adam said now john
[2:58:34] paid jesus the worst compliment he could
[2:58:36] have ever paid him
[2:58:38] and jesus turned around and paid him the
[2:58:39] greatest compliment he could have ever
[2:58:41] paid him
[2:58:42] never miss a man greater born of a woman
[2:58:44] than john the baptist
[2:58:46] he said
[2:58:47] and his eagle eye got filmed over he
[2:58:49] said here he is a gentle fellow pushed
[2:58:51] around here and there a strange messiah
[2:58:54] and after he announced that he was he'd
[2:58:56] come back saying is this him
[2:58:59] but jesus
[2:59:02] understands
[2:59:04] our weaknesses
[2:59:07] amen
[2:59:10] hallelujah
[2:59:11] praise god amen
[2:59:14] because you realize friends
[2:59:17] that if the lord didn't understand these
[2:59:19] parts of us
[2:59:20] understand how we think how we feel are
[2:59:23] the emotions and all of the stuff that
[2:59:25] is attached to us do you realize many of
[2:59:26] the battles that you fight are not
[2:59:28] really your battles
[2:59:29] there are battles that were handed down
[2:59:31] to you
[2:59:32] i've got laying right here the prophet
[2:59:33] of god said all that sin and all those
[2:59:36] curses and all that stuff visited on the
[2:59:37] sons amen it come all the way from adam
[2:59:40] and eve and it's passed through the
[2:59:41] genetics passed through the bloodline
[2:59:43] passed through the stream of time until
[2:59:45] it's made up you
[2:59:46] so that temper that you battle with that
[2:59:48] ain't your temper that was your great
[2:59:50] great great great great great great
[2:59:52] great great great granddaddy's temper
[2:59:54] and it multiplied and it multiplied
[2:59:56] don't you see rather why this bride is
[2:59:58] going to be one of the greatest
[2:59:59] overcomers of any age as i'm not just
[3:00:02] whipping my temper but i'm whipping
[3:00:04] generation before me that fell into this
[3:00:07] body to make me what i am
[3:00:11] that's right
[3:00:13] so here's john sitting in prison is this
[3:00:15] him
[3:00:16] his little eagle eyes filmed over where
[3:00:18] he couldn't see too clearly
[3:00:21] now jesus could have
[3:00:22] said what in the world is a matter with
[3:00:25] you john right
[3:00:27] you saw the light above me
[3:00:29] when i come into the river that day
[3:00:31] you heard the spirit of god speak from
[3:00:33] that dove and say this is my beloved son
[3:00:36] and whom i'm well pleased to dwell in
[3:00:38] you saw the vindication and the anointed
[3:00:40] and you even humbled yourself and said
[3:00:42] i'm not even worthy to unlatch your
[3:00:43] shoes or latch them up even
[3:00:47] but jesus understands
[3:00:56] we don't have time to read it but in the
[3:00:58] rapture message brother rem is saying to
[3:01:00] another man that he's just preaching and
[3:01:01] he says because he says he calls his
[3:01:03] name mike said in that wonderful mike
[3:01:06] and he said think about it he knows
[3:01:08] all about us
[3:01:10] and he loves you before there was a
[3:01:11] world he knows your nature
[3:01:14] he knows your weaknesses
[3:01:16] he knows your habits
[3:01:18] he knowed all about you and what she was
[3:01:20] going to be and he looked all across
[3:01:21] this great universe and he said i choose
[3:01:23] you
[3:01:25] amen
[3:01:28] do you realize that nothing of what you
[3:01:31] earn
[3:01:33] was evidence nor nor a criteria
[3:01:37] for whether he accepted you or rejected
[3:01:39] you
[3:01:40] not only does he know your family and
[3:01:42] know you but he knows what kind of stock
[3:01:45] what kind of ilk you come from
[3:01:48] he knows all the way back into the
[3:01:50] generations of the generations of the
[3:01:52] generations plum from the creation of
[3:01:54] adam on down to make up you six thousand
[3:01:57] years later god knows all of them
[3:02:00] lifetime time
[3:02:04] and he knew before the world ever began
[3:02:06] what she was going to be
[3:02:08] what she was going to look like
[3:02:10] what your strengths would be and what
[3:02:12] your weaknesses would be what your good
[3:02:14] parts would be and what your bad parts
[3:02:15] would be
[3:02:16] and none of that stopped him from saying
[3:02:19] but i love you
[3:02:20] i love you
[3:02:22] i love you
[3:02:24] i love you
[3:02:33] hallelujah to his holy name
[3:02:37] let's bow our heads together can we
[3:02:42] now if the musicians have just played
[3:02:44] quietly for me
[3:02:46] with your heads bowed now nobody looking
[3:02:48] around

[3:02:50] of my voice for a minute
[3:02:56] as you stand here today
[3:02:59] i'm sure that in your heart
[3:03:02] you already know
[3:03:04] how the lord's been dealing with you

[3:03:13] lord what he's dealing with you about

[3:03:21] mama your daddy not cousins aunt uncle
[3:03:23] it's up to you and the lord
[3:03:26] but while you're standing here in his
[3:03:27] presence like this

[3:03:40] fearing god's judgment

[3:03:54] for me

[3:04:00] had grieved his great heart till he was
[3:04:02] weeping
[3:04:03] noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
[3:04:08] if the lord has shown you grace and
[3:04:09] leniency
[3:04:11] it has most certainly been more than you
[3:04:13] expected
[3:04:14] and you ought to be willing to be able
[3:04:16] to say lord now let all these chains
[3:04:18] fall off me let all these bondages
[3:04:21] all these legalistical spirits all these
[3:04:23] little extraordinary grace type spirits

[3:04:53] will go through this congregation

[3:08:00] get the people
[3:08:01] you know this is where i want to get the
[3:08:04] people the reason why the mysteries were
[3:08:06] revealed is god putting his word in your
[3:08:09] hands
[3:08:10] not for me to control your life
[3:08:15] that's the reason why i say every time
[3:08:17] god reveal weaknesses to you is to give
[3:08:20] you an opportunity
[3:08:22] for you to partner with him
[3:08:25] to deal with that weakness
[3:08:29] he's inviting you he has already paid
[3:08:31] the
[3:08:32] price he said now you see it let's deal
[3:08:36] with hate
[3:08:37] take every promise in this world
[3:08:40] and deal with that situation
[3:08:42] that's what god is doing
[3:08:44] and until you do it until you do it
[3:08:49] praise the lord
[3:08:50] it's not going to miraculously go away
[3:08:58] until you learn to apply the word of god
[3:09:01] to your weaknesses
[3:09:09] i know you were blamed lord on the
[3:09:11] stance blessing that god understands
[3:09:14] he knows all about it
