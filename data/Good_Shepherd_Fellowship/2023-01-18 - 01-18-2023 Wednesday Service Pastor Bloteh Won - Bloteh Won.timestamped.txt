[10:04] and she's experiencing pains it looks
[10:08] like the the
[10:12] the shock from the accident is beginning
[10:15] to to reflect through her body so she's
[10:17] feeling pains in her body and she want
[10:20] us to
[10:21] to remember her in prayer tonight
[10:25] last Wednesday after service uh on our
[10:28] way home from church the family was
[10:31] going in and there was uh
[10:35] a gentleman that was still getting my
[10:38] wife and while they were driving
[10:40] and and then all of a sudden he left
[10:44] from behind them and hit the van in the
[10:47] front
[10:48] and it was it was a little bit
[10:50] terrifying for the children and all
[10:53] those that were driving but we thank God
[10:55] that uh nothing worse than that happened
[10:58] amen
[10:59] and uh
[11:02] so we want to thank God
[11:04] for keeping them safe the kids are a
[11:07] little bit under the weather and their
[11:09] Grandmom is not well so that's why they
[11:12] are in for service tonight we want to
[11:14] remember them
[11:15] and uh
[11:18] [Music]
[11:21] we want to pray for them
[11:24] many of you saw the text that came true
[11:26] or brother Max mom passing we want to
[11:31] remember the family continuously in
[11:33] prayer
[11:35] there is a dear sister from
[11:37] Liberia that is dealing with pains in
[11:40] her body
[11:42] that seems to be
[11:45] a little bit overwhelming for her the
[11:49] cost is not it's not fully known
[11:52] uh just from
[11:55] the increasing of the pain is almost
[11:57] like a kind of fall
[11:59] paralyzed State she's beginning to feel
[12:02] a little bit of sensation in her body
[12:04] Sister Evelyn and text me in uh today
[12:08] with the with the increasing pains that
[12:11] she's experiencing in her body so we
[12:14] want to remember her in prayer
[12:16] that's a prayer request here my neighbor
[12:18] has a prayer request for her niece Angie
[12:23] she had
[12:27] a snowmobi accident
[12:30] that was pretty bad
[12:32] we want to pray for that too
[12:35] another neighbor
[12:37] is in the hospital
[12:39] appreciate your prayers too
[12:42] and I would guess
[12:44] I guess this is from Sister Naomi yeah
[12:47] okay okay so we want to take those knees
[12:51] and and that's another prayer request
[12:53] here for the dear sister that came
[12:55] through the service on Sunday uh
[12:59] for some reason I think the deacons were
[13:01] taking care of something in
[13:04] they came into service so we didn't
[13:08] get her name to to greet her
[13:11] properly but then after the service uh
[13:15] brother Ben
[13:17] stopped them to talk with them and and
[13:19] we also had a privilege to talk to her
[13:22] she asked that we pray for her
[13:26] she's finding her way back to the Lord
[13:28] uh
[13:31] after believing the message and a lot of
[13:34] different struggle she's getting back to
[13:36] the Lord
[13:37] and just with our prayer request there's
[13:41] uh that is something that is becoming
[13:44] common
[13:45] uh and we expect to see more of that
[13:50] we expect to see more there are many
[13:52] people
[13:53] that have
[13:55] sometimes people will make some ugly
[13:58] choices
[13:59] thinking that if they do those things
[14:02] God we keep them out of the Kingdom
[14:05] or if they do those things it is done it
[14:08] is finished with them
[14:10] but all you are doing is that you will
[14:12] just be building regret for yourself
[14:15] because when God get a hold of your
[14:17] heart it is not by your choice
[14:20] and not by your choice will he let go
[14:24] it is by his choice
[14:26] so we're beginning to see a trench of
[14:28] that many people finding their way back
[14:31] to the Lord
[14:33] and uh
[14:37] so this dear sister want us to pray for
[14:39] her that God will
[14:42] will be able to help her
[14:45] that she can be able to find that peace
[14:47] Within
[14:48] and so we want to just take those knees
[14:53] to the Lord tonight while the musician
[14:54] plays Softly

[52:04] a couple of few times since last
[52:06] Wednesday we we've been reading Saint
[52:09] John chapter 9.
[52:11] I want to take a quote that I came
[52:13] across I was listening to
[52:16] to uh the message the Messiah
[52:19] and uh so let's let's go back to Saint
[52:22] John chapter 9. I don't know why the the
[52:25] holy spirit is keeping us there but I
[52:27] show he has a reason amen
[52:30] but there is there is just uh
[52:34] this this uh there's a quote yet I'm
[52:37] going to read a testimony actually
[52:39] and uh
[52:43] and to me it's a little close to what is
[52:46] happening here in Saint John chapter
[52:48] nine so for a scriptural reading let's
[52:50] read um
[52:52] verse 1.
[52:54] and as Jesus passed by he saw a man
[52:57] which was blind
[52:59] from his birth
[53:02] and his disciple asked him saying master
[53:06] who did Sin this man or his parents
[53:10] that he was born blind and Jesus
[53:14] answered neither have this man seen
[53:17] known his parents but they are the works
[53:19] of God should be made manifest in him
[53:23] praise the Lord the Lord bless you you
[53:25] can have your seat so we will go right
[53:27] right into this now and I would just
[53:29] read a few quotes and then we will we
[53:32] will call it up for the service tonight
[53:34] so you can be able to get home
[53:37] before
[53:42] the weather coming upon us now Birdman
[53:45] is talking about a testimony year he was
[53:48] preaching over in in Shreveport and just
[53:50] before he got into his message he says
[53:53] this little woman standing there
[53:56] her baby died over in Germany
[53:59] her husband was a captain
[54:03] and they call up
[54:06] long distance about five times through a
[54:10] day and night to ask me to come calling
[54:13] from Germany
[54:15] said they know that God
[54:18] would raise the little baby up
[54:21] I said let me go pray
[54:25] and I went and prayed
[54:27] pray that afternoon that night
[54:32] and I will show you
[54:35] whether the doctor believed or not
[54:39] when she did already give the doctor a
[54:42] book to read
[54:44] I believe it's called Prophet this is
[54:46] South Africa
[54:47] something like that she said God will
[54:51] raise the baby up
[54:53] the little mother said God will raise
[54:56] the baby up
[54:58] and
[54:59] and the baby have been dead
[55:03] before
[55:05] uh before they know it about four or
[55:08] five hours and saw the God the Father
[55:12] were down to
[55:15] the base because he's a military man
[55:18] where he was and the baby have been dead
[55:22] died in the night and saw the doctor
[55:25] said all right tell you what we would do
[55:29] said
[55:30] we will slip over and turn the oxygen
[55:34] the oxygen back on so they have the baby
[55:37] on the ventilator if we were if we would
[55:39] think about it that way
[55:41] and uh and he let the baby lay there for
[55:46] two days
[55:47] with the oxygen turned on waiting
[55:51] and I was over here praying
[55:55] they was going to fly me in a cross in a
[55:58] jet I could live here
[56:02] with an army Jack and be back the same
[56:05] day to Germany
[56:07] and one morning
[56:10] praise the Lord
[56:13] amen
[56:15] I think I did something here my hands
[56:17] might have
[56:18] moved
[56:22] and one morning about daylight I got up
[56:28] and the wife went out of the room
[56:31] she went out of the room
[56:35] are they just waking up and are laying
[56:39] there a little bit
[56:42] directly I heard something coming into
[56:45] the room and I look
[56:47] there was something moving in the room
[56:50] and I jumped up and I said Lord What
[56:53] would
[56:54] what will you have yourself known
[56:58] he said don't rebuke that
[57:01] that's the hand of the Lord
[57:05] see
[57:06] so I got her on the phone
[57:09] I said no
[57:11] God has called your baby
[57:15] and so when she come over to see us
[57:19] left
[57:21] her at the house
[57:23] when when I left yesterday she said what
[57:27] was it brother Brennan
[57:30] my weakness of faith
[57:33] praise the Lord now this is the place
[57:36] that caught me in Saint John chapter 9.
[57:40] what was it
[57:42] praise the Lord
[57:44] why was he born blind
[57:47] is it because of his mother saying or
[57:50] his father sin or in his father line or
[57:53] his mother line this woman is asking
[57:55] brother Brandon what was it
[57:58] is it because my faith was weak
[58:02] amen
[58:05] my weakness of faith I said you got
[58:09] great faith
[58:12] you pray for your baby you and your
[58:15] husband head on
[58:17] God to raise your baby and he refused to
[58:21] do it because
[58:24] he knows what best
[58:26] till you love him
[58:31] praise the Lord
[58:34] amen
[58:36] it's hard to see that as a great faith
[58:39] praise the Lord
[58:41] I know if the courts will have gone in
[58:43] the other way then brother Brandon
[58:44] prayed and the baby race or we always
[58:46] shall Hallelujah
[58:49] but it looks like the court goes another
[58:51] way that you don't expect
[58:54] so you are still dealing with the shark
[58:58] how can that be great faith
[59:03] how can that be great faith
[59:07] praise the Lord
[59:10] I love it like that
[59:13] when you are dealing with the shock of
[59:14] the word
[59:21] you have great faith you pray for your
[59:24] baby you and your husband head on to it
[59:27] God to raise your baby he refused to do
[59:30] it because he knows who are best and
[59:33] still you love him that's real Faith so
[59:37] I talked a few calls tonight on real
[59:39] faith that we will read for this prayer
[59:42] meeting amen he says that's real faith
[59:46] that is real faith
[59:48] when you can't explain it
[59:52] praise the Lord
[59:53] when it's not in your favor but yet it
[59:57] holds you on
[1:00:01] praise the Lord
[1:00:03] it makes you to realize that you are not
[1:00:05] the one holding on to faith is faith
[1:00:08] that is holding on to you
[1:00:11] that's real Faith anybody when mountains
[1:00:16] are moving and things can have faith
[1:00:20] but let it go backwards one time
[1:00:25] and see how it works
[1:00:27] that's when you prove whether you got
[1:00:31] faith or not
[1:00:34] praise the Lord
[1:00:36] that's when we prove whether we got
[1:00:39] faith or net
[1:00:44] every Psalm that comes to God must be
[1:00:48] testing and tried of God
[1:00:50] so remember our trials work at patients
[1:00:54] and patient work at Hope and so forth
[1:00:57] so we just hold on to God whether he
[1:01:03] bless us or not
[1:01:06] we are right there to believe him anyhow
[1:01:11] can we say Amen tonight I want to help
[1:01:15] you recover from your shock amen
[1:01:20] we just hold on to God whether he bless
[1:01:23] us or not we are right there to believe
[1:01:27] him
[1:01:28] cause he promised it
[1:01:30] and to see how it does amen
[1:01:34] praise the Lord so brother bam says
[1:01:37] that's real faith
[1:01:40] when situation comes backward
[1:01:43] and we can stay hold on to our testimony
[1:01:47] praise the Lord amen he never changed
[1:01:51] their position to stay flat from Germany
[1:01:53] and come to see brother Brennan
[1:01:55] praise the Lord they never wrote an
[1:01:58] article in the newspaper and say he's a
[1:02:00] false prophet
[1:02:02] right
[1:02:05] praise the Lord they were believing for
[1:02:08] him to pray and get an answer from God
[1:02:10] and he prayed and he got an answer and
[1:02:13] told them that the Lord
[1:02:16] rebuked me from taking their uh uh or
[1:02:21] the Lord told me not to rebuke death off
[1:02:23] of the child
[1:02:26] because the Lord Knows Best
[1:02:28] praise the Lord
[1:02:30] so I believe that is the same situation
[1:02:32] here in the life of this young boy the
[1:02:35] Lord knew best
[1:02:37] it was not because the parents were
[1:02:40] Sinners Jesus allotted it to that the
[1:02:44] work of God should be made manifest
[1:02:49] are we together
[1:02:52] and we are living in such a time where
[1:02:56] we will trust the Lord that God will
[1:02:58] help us there are more of these real
[1:03:00] faith will be seen amen
[1:03:03] praise the Lord because I believe where
[1:03:05] we have the word a lot of the time has
[1:03:08] been intellectual faith
[1:03:10] right amen well we reason things out in
[1:03:14] our mind
[1:03:15] and sometimes it's far from the reality
[1:03:20] but faith never tells lies brother Brown
[1:03:23] says here also how the angel came to me
[1:03:26] and he says now the devil don't care how
[1:03:30] much you kick and stream
[1:03:33] he just said right there he knows what
[1:03:36] he's doing but he knows how much
[1:03:39] Authority he got he hasn't got none when
[1:03:43] real faith is standing there
[1:03:48] amen his trip of everything he's got
[1:03:53] but you have to know that
[1:03:56] you have to be revealed to you
[1:03:59] praise the Lord they have to be revealed
[1:04:02] to you
[1:04:06] fundamental
[1:04:09] Foundation of Faith he also says now we
[1:04:12] hear so many people well if I only have
[1:04:16] faith
[1:04:19] he says faith is or faith is unconscious
[1:04:24] thing you're real faith
[1:04:27] you are unconscious of it
[1:04:32] you don't know
[1:04:34] that you have he says uh you don't know
[1:04:39] that
[1:04:40] the faith you have got
[1:04:43] is an unconscious matter with you
[1:04:48] could you imagine Jesus Jesus
[1:04:50] questioning whether he have faith or not
[1:04:53] to stop the wind or steal the wave or
[1:04:56] have faith enough to raise Lazaro up he
[1:05:00] never questioned his faith
[1:05:02] the first thing before we can have faith
[1:05:05] we got to have some Foundation of faith
[1:05:10] praise the Lord and we have to realize
[1:05:13] that Faith don't rest on our emotion
[1:05:17] praise the Lord
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:19] Faith read solidly on God's promised
[1:05:23] word
[1:05:24] he said we have got to have some
[1:05:26] foundation for Faith there's got to be
[1:05:29] something behind it
[1:05:31] let's take another one tonight from
[1:05:33] expectation you know some people
[1:05:37] has great big Faith like that he's
[1:05:42] measuring it they can be healed in a
[1:05:45] moment

[1:05:49] they can be healed in a week
[1:05:52] some have muscle see fat Faith takes
[1:05:56] them a long time

[1:06:42] is not intellectual
[1:06:46] it's not reason
[1:06:48] normal is real
[1:06:51] is the spirit of God witnessing through
[1:06:54] you God's word is truth

[1:07:01] brings the result
[1:07:04] amen
[1:07:06] what we need today
[1:07:07] is some real Journey of Faith into
[1:07:11] action
[1:07:12] we need real Faith a man who dared to
[1:07:18] put God's word to their heart and apply
[1:07:22] it to themselves
[1:07:23] you try to apply it uh to the generation
[1:07:28] gone by the Bible says
[1:07:31] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:07:34] today and forever
[1:07:40] he's forever God
[1:07:42] he never fails he's the same in
[1:07:45] principle he's the same in power

[1:07:53] he walked on the banks of Galilee
[1:07:57] and appear
[1:08:01] and appear nightly on this pulpit
[1:08:05] and prove himself alive from the dead
[1:08:09] what I was studying at I I felt blessed
[1:08:11] reading that and and the way that I felt
[1:08:15] blessed of it is that I believe that
[1:08:18] there seemed Jesus that walks the the
[1:08:21] banks of Galilee appeared every time on
[1:08:24] this Pulpit how through his word
[1:08:29] praise the lord we must be able to see

[1:09:13] to the sin will operate through God's
[1:09:15] holy word
[1:09:17] praise the Lord it has one China to
[1:09:20] operate he must come back through the
[1:09:23] word

[1:09:45] show you something and then we will
[1:09:47] close
[1:09:49] until something comes down it is this is
[1:09:52] from belief from the heart until
[1:09:53] something comes down
[1:09:55] on the inside of you that's just said
[1:09:59] it's so and there's all there is to it
[1:10:04] there is not enough demons out of Tom
[1:10:06] and whoever shake it from you
[1:10:10] is something on the inside
[1:10:13] called the half there is where real
[1:10:17] Faith find is resting place
[1:10:20] intellectual we try to reason about it
[1:10:23] now let's just be reasonable but faith
[1:10:27] has no reasoning is is just has one
[1:10:32] thing and that's God's word

[1:10:56] will
[1:10:57] close the prayer meeting tonight
[1:11:00] ask chapter 17.
[1:11:30] as chapter 17.
[1:11:43] verse 2 and and Paul as his mother was
[1:11:47] went in unto them in three Sabbath days
[1:11:51] reason with them out of the scripture I
[1:11:54] want for you to notice that Paul passing
[1:11:57] through
[1:11:58] and
[1:11:59] amphipolis he went into the synagoguese
[1:12:02] this is in thessalonica
[1:12:05] and he spent three Sabbath
[1:12:09] reasoning with them out of the
[1:12:11] scriptures
[1:12:13] praise the Lord
[1:12:15] opening and alleging that Christ must
[1:12:17] need have suffered in raising again from
[1:12:20] the dead and that this Jesus whom I
[1:12:24] preach unto you is Christ
[1:12:27] and some of them believe
[1:12:30] and consulted with Paul and Silas and
[1:12:33] all the devote Greeks a great multitude
[1:12:37] and all the chief women
[1:12:40] not a few but the Jews which believe
[1:12:43] that move with envy and talk unto them
[1:12:47] setting low fellows of a base sought and
[1:12:51] gather a company and said all the city
[1:12:55] on an uproar assaulting the house of
[1:12:58] Jason and sought to bring them out to
[1:13:02] the people and when they found them that
[1:13:05] they drew Jason and setting brethrens
[1:13:08] onto the ruler of the city crying Beast
[1:13:11] that have turned the word upside down
[1:13:15] I come hither
[1:13:19] also what a testimony
[1:13:22] amen
[1:13:24] water testimony what an accusation to
[1:13:26] accuse them that they turned the word
[1:13:28] upside down
[1:13:29] praise the Lord
[1:13:31] wherever they have that turn the word
[1:13:33] upside down is able to turn our word
[1:13:36] upside down
[1:13:37] amen they were holding to the Revere
[1:13:41] word of the owl they were holding to the
[1:13:44] truth
[1:13:46] of that day so it turned the word upside
[1:13:49] down is able to turn your word upside
[1:13:51] down
[1:13:52] now so you read this and uh and we can
[1:13:56] go on here
[1:13:57] and uh
[1:14:02] whom Jason verse 7 receive and these
[1:14:06] also do contrary to the decreed of
[1:14:08] Caesar saying that there is another king
[1:14:11] one Jesus
[1:14:14] and
[1:14:15] and they troubled the people and the
[1:14:17] ruler of the city when they heard these
[1:14:20] things
[1:14:21] and when they have taken
[1:14:24] uh security of Jason and and all of the
[1:14:28] other they let them go
[1:14:30] and the brethrough is immediately sent
[1:14:32] Away Paul and Silas By Night onto barium
[1:14:38] ooh coming here went into the synagas of
[1:14:42] the Jews
[1:14:44] these were more noble
[1:14:48] than those in thessalonica aimed that
[1:14:52] they received the word with all
[1:14:55] Readiness of mine
[1:14:57] and search the scripture daily
[1:15:00] whether those things were truth
[1:15:05] praise the Lord
[1:15:06] I want to end right there
[1:15:09] now I was I was looking at this and what
[1:15:13] I saw here is that I saw uh two group of
[1:15:16] people here praise the Lord
[1:15:19] Paul down here over in in thessalonica
[1:15:23] went down there into the synagoguese and
[1:15:26] the scripture says three
[1:15:28] Sabbath day reason with them on the
[1:15:32] scripture
[1:15:33] praise the Lord amen he went back and
[1:15:35] forth taking the Old Testament and what
[1:15:38] was happening in their day you have to
[1:15:40] realize that the New Testament was not
[1:15:43] written at a time so he have to show
[1:15:46] them what is happening today let's go
[1:15:48] back to Isaiah let's see it amen let's
[1:15:51] go back over to the Psalms when when
[1:15:54] David said my God my god what have thou
[1:15:57] forsaken me that was the same thing they
[1:15:59] said Jesus did on the cross so he was
[1:16:02] going back and forth whatever that was
[1:16:04] happening he was trying to show them in
[1:16:07] the scripture three Saba Bay he reasoned
[1:16:10] with him
[1:16:11] praise the Lord
[1:16:13] and what what was the result that it
[1:16:16] brought
[1:16:18] we know there were some that believe and
[1:16:20] and few of them that believe there but
[1:16:24] we see that a broad and uproarth and uh
[1:16:28] and which of course they testify these
[1:16:31] men that have turned the word upside
[1:16:33] down has come into our place that they
[1:16:35] have to send Paul and Salas away they
[1:16:38] have to have them Escape by night
[1:16:42] but then when it came down over here to
[1:16:45] this other City to these Berry and
[1:16:48] brethrens they realized that as we see
[1:16:51] in the scripture these other men had
[1:16:54] different attitude to the word
[1:16:59] praise the Lord
[1:17:00] these people on this other side was
[1:17:03] reasoning with courts
[1:17:06] going back this is in the synagoguese
[1:17:08] that was where the Pharisees sat I mean
[1:17:11] they did a lot of argument with courts
[1:17:13] the scripture says that but Moses also
[1:17:16] said this and then and the prophet also
[1:17:18] said this free Sabbath Paul had to go
[1:17:21] back and forth reasoning with these
[1:17:24] people
[1:17:24] but when he came to this city this man
[1:17:27] the Bible says there were more Noble
[1:17:31] than those intestinal the Bible gave
[1:17:35] them such an honorable place
[1:17:38] and the reason why the Bibles gave them
[1:17:41] an honorable place is there them they
[1:17:44] listened to what they heard they receive
[1:17:46] it the Bible said with a red mind
[1:17:49] and not only that
[1:17:51] they took what they heard back to the
[1:17:54] word
[1:17:56] praise the Lord
[1:18:00] they received a word with a red mind and
[1:18:04] they say the scripture daily
[1:18:08] whether those things were so right
[1:18:12] they were not just satisfied with what
[1:18:16] they were hearing
[1:18:19] a faith a faith
[1:18:22] the resting place of faith is the word
[1:18:25] then whatever we are hearing we must
[1:18:28] take it back to the word
[1:18:34] it is not just enough to give us a good
[1:18:37] feeling
[1:18:39] amen
[1:18:42] thank you so much that the holy spirit
[1:18:44] says these men are honorable God says we
[1:18:47] are honorable when we can take what we
[1:18:49] hear back to the word
[1:18:53] it's a great honor to God
[1:18:56] not not to be satisfied my pastor say or
[1:18:59] my church say no
[1:19:02] that's how we get real faith
[1:19:05] we take whatever we hear in the world
[1:19:07] back
[1:19:09] or whatever we hear preach back to the
[1:19:12] word
[1:19:12] because the word is the foundation for
[1:19:16] faith
[1:19:23] we can have some a situation we we can
[1:19:27] be caught up in some sensation and and
[1:19:30] some feeling you know that you know God
[1:19:32] Did It Before yeah you know and and we
[1:19:34] can go through all the testimonies in a
[1:19:36] different things
[1:19:37] but that genuine feeling in your heart
[1:19:40] have to be resting
[1:19:43] holy and solid on God's word
[1:19:47] praise the Lord
[1:19:51] I have a feeling in my heart that uh uh
[1:19:55] uh uh those people that have that
[1:19:58] situation where not just people that
[1:20:02] were caught up you know because they
[1:20:04] were seeing miracles in brother Branham
[1:20:06] Ministry
[1:20:07] right because it's hard to to
[1:20:11] believe a person brother Branham says
[1:20:13] that's one of the difficult things that
[1:20:15] you know God have ever had for one motor
[1:20:18] to believe in another mortar
[1:20:21] praise the Lord
[1:20:22] so when the ones that we trust and we
[1:20:24] believe
[1:20:26] has to fail
[1:20:28] they break our confidence
[1:20:31] so I believe that the the harder place
[1:20:35] where they rested their faith
[1:20:38] on God's word
[1:20:41] concerning brother Brandon Ministry
[1:20:45] praise the Lord
[1:20:47] now this is not just uh uh
[1:20:51] uh you know this is not just
[1:20:53] uh
[1:20:56] a child that was sick
[1:20:58] you know after reading a Prophet this is
[1:21:01] South Africa
[1:21:03] and year and about
[1:21:05] the little boy that was raised in
[1:21:08] Finland
[1:21:09] and now you ever see they have a child
[1:21:12] that is in it
[1:21:14] it's easier to hear those things and uh
[1:21:18] you know uh rejoice in it and testify
[1:21:21] but when when when such a situation come
[1:21:24] home to you
[1:21:25] how do we deal with it
[1:21:29] and that situation was home to them
[1:21:33] praise the Lord
[1:21:34] barbam said she even took my book
[1:21:38] the prophet visits South Africa give it
[1:21:40] to the doctors
[1:21:42] say read this book The testimony in this
[1:21:45] book will happen before your eyes
[1:21:47] but when God Speak
[1:21:49] there was something in them
[1:21:52] to rest
[1:21:54] their case on God's word
[1:22:00] praise the Lord
[1:22:03] so you see it as we as we as we uh uh
[1:22:07] you know listening to to the message you
[1:22:10] take notes you go home and study your
[1:22:13] notes or you're even in your own uh
[1:22:16] private devotion you read things in the
[1:22:19] message or hear things in the message
[1:22:20] you know it's it's good to pause and and
[1:22:23] make sure that those things are building
[1:22:26] solid foundation for your faith
[1:22:32] praise the Lord
[1:22:35] because we we will need real faith for
[1:22:38] the hour that we are living in
[1:22:42] and not just some sensation
[1:22:46] we will need real faith
[1:22:49] praise the Lord
[1:22:50] so that's my comparison of Saint John
[1:22:54] chapter 9
[1:22:56] you know when when when I heard that I
[1:22:58] was I was I was listening to that in the
[1:23:00] morning getting ready to get out of the
[1:23:02] housing and and and and and and I heard
[1:23:05] that it just it just caught my mind but
[1:23:08] a band of so she said but Brandon
[1:23:10] why was there was it because my faith
[1:23:13] was weak
[1:23:15] the prophet said no
[1:23:16] you are having real faith
[1:23:21] amen don't blame yourself
[1:23:26] don't blame yourself
[1:23:27] see what is your reaction
[1:23:32] after you have received God's will for
[1:23:36] your situation what is your reaction
[1:23:43] let's buy our house together tonight
[1:23:49] foreign
[1:23:53] father we just want to thank you thank
[1:23:56] you Father for just this little time of
[1:24:01] praying Lord and to be able to share
[1:24:04] from your word we can read these things
[1:24:07] in the scripture father Lord and it is
[1:24:10] good to see it in the light of the
[1:24:12] message it is good to see it father
[1:24:14] around our life Lord God
[1:24:18] precious Lord in many of us will go
[1:24:21] father like brother Branham says we can
[1:24:23] rejoice in the moving of the mountain
[1:24:26] but when things return back to God what
[1:24:29] is our reaction
[1:24:32] are we able to stay stand there on the
[1:24:34] word of God are we able to stay stand
[1:24:36] and say Lord I believe you are God and
[1:24:40] your ways are passed finding out
[1:24:43] father Lord we just want to pray to God
[1:24:45] for the hour that we are living in the
[1:24:48] Lord that you o God will will help us
[1:24:51] Lord we cannot go about our reasoning
[1:24:53] Lord Jesus we cannot go by just some
[1:24:56] fantasy in our mind we must bring it
[1:24:58] back to your word we want to be Lord
[1:25:00] father like those Berean believers who
[1:25:03] God father they were taking everything
[1:25:05] back to your word
[1:25:08] and it pleased you father to call them
[1:25:10] honorable people noble men
[1:25:14] because they receive your word and faith
[1:25:16] comes by hearing of the word
[1:25:19] receiving the word your Prophet said
[1:25:22] acting upon the word
[1:25:25] dear Lord help us to God help us father
[1:25:29] help us Lord Jesus
[1:25:31] that we can take things back to the word
[1:25:36] that we cannot be a strange to our Bible
[1:25:39] we cannot be estranged to the message we
[1:25:41] can just make up things in our mind but
[1:25:44] we can take it back to the word
