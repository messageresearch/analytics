[1:06:01] service from whom may you bless them
[1:06:03] also
[1:06:04] we thank you we love you and we
[1:06:06] appreciate you in jesus name amen
[1:06:10] amen praise the lord the lord bless you
[1:06:12] you can have your seed
[1:06:15] glory be to god amen amen
[1:06:19] amen
[1:06:22] well you might
[1:06:23] you might think and says uh
[1:06:26] uh
[1:06:28] you know well brother one what what what
[1:06:31] what is the difference
[1:06:34] you know what is the difference
[1:06:38] praise the lord
[1:06:40] what's the difference between set you
[1:06:42] free and make you free
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:06:48] they might they might sound the same but
[1:06:50] there is a big difference
[1:06:53] there is actually a big difference
[1:06:56] and uh and we will we will look at that
[1:06:59] a little bit
[1:07:01] jesus said we read in chapter
[1:07:05] 32
[1:07:07] and you shall know the truth
[1:07:09] and the truth shall make you free
[1:07:12] then answer
[1:07:14] him
[1:07:15] you know they answer him saying we we be
[1:07:18] abraham's seed
[1:07:20] and we're never in bondage
[1:07:25] to any man
[1:07:27] how
[1:07:28] served there
[1:07:31] yea
[1:07:32] shall
[1:07:33] be made free
[1:07:35] praise the lord
[1:07:38] jesus
[1:07:39] answered them verily verily i say unto
[1:07:41] you whosoever committed sin
[1:07:46] is the seventh to sin
[1:07:50] and
[1:07:51] the seven aboright not in the house
[1:07:54] forever but the sun
[1:07:58] a buried in the house
[1:08:02] if the sun
[1:08:04] therefore shall
[1:08:06] make again he comes
[1:08:10] praise the lord
[1:08:11] yes
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:15] if the son shall make you free
[1:08:18] ye shall be free
[1:08:21] indeed
[1:08:23] now so the concept the concept not to
[1:08:26] play with words but the concept there is
[1:08:29] that if a man is set free from praising
[1:08:32] he can go back to praising
[1:08:37] when you are set free you can go back
[1:08:41] but when you are make free
[1:08:44] you are free
[1:08:47] indeed
[1:08:49] so we are all in the making process
[1:08:58] oh praise the lord
[1:08:59] what a wonderful jesus we said
[1:09:03] we are all in the making process
[1:09:07] oh my goodness
[1:09:08] you love the lord tonight
[1:09:11] oh man
[1:09:14] praise the lord
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:19] now so uh
[1:09:20] uh
[1:09:23] uh
[1:09:24] i was actually going to talk a little
[1:09:26] bit on justification tonight that we
[1:09:28] started there some time ago but i had
[1:09:31] this thought on my mind i kept looking
[1:09:33] through the scripture
[1:09:34] uh on
[1:09:36] on on
[1:09:39] on on
[1:09:42] a few of these
[1:09:46] as i kept looking at the scripture and
[1:09:48] then uh
[1:09:51] i thought i said well okay
[1:09:53] maybe uh
[1:09:55] we can
[1:09:56] kind of look look a little bit on on
[1:09:59] that tonight
[1:10:00] and see how uh
[1:10:02] you know how the the holy spirit will be
[1:10:05] able to help us
[1:10:06] you know if we we go into
[1:10:09] into studying
[1:10:12] praise the lord
[1:10:14] amen
[1:10:17] so he that the son make free
[1:10:20] is uh it's freed indeed
[1:10:22] and uh uh
[1:10:26] and if you if you if you steady you will
[1:10:29] realize that
[1:10:31] jesus
[1:10:33] in
[1:10:34] [Music]
[1:10:37] dealing with people that were that were
[1:10:39] possessed
[1:10:41] he always used this statement and says
[1:10:43] will thou be mayhold
[1:10:48] okay
[1:10:49] you always say that without being made
[1:10:51] hold
[1:10:53] you know
[1:10:54] and and and there's there's just a whole
[1:10:57] there's a whole lot of thought
[1:10:59] uh uh behind that
[1:11:02] uh
[1:11:04] there's a whole lot of talk behind there
[1:11:06] but if you if you if you if you actually
[1:11:09] you're actually steady
[1:11:11] and and look at this and follow it a
[1:11:14] little bit
[1:11:15] you realize that uh
[1:11:19] there are a lot of things that we can we
[1:11:20] can kind of look at the time is is not
[1:11:23] our frame tonight but we will try to
[1:11:25] make the best best use out of it okay
[1:11:29] we try to make the best use out of the
[1:11:31] time tonight
[1:11:33] with a few minutes that is left for us
[1:11:36] so let's just look at this thought
[1:11:38] of to be made free
[1:11:47] when i look at the
[1:11:50] or started thinking about that
[1:11:53] this afternoon
[1:12:05] sorry let me
[1:12:07] back up here a little bit
[1:12:24] i tried to look at the word
[1:12:26] yet in this i was just looking at
[1:12:28] something he says
[1:12:31] set you free implied that something
[1:12:35] outside of you like a church has has to
[1:12:38] come
[1:12:40] and free you
[1:12:42] as in the prisoner was set free
[1:12:47] by his capture
[1:12:49] whereas make you free is saying that
[1:12:54] the simple knowledge
[1:12:57] of truth
[1:12:59] will allow you
[1:13:01] to free
[1:13:03] yourself
[1:13:07] amen
[1:13:10] are we together amen are you seeing the
[1:13:13] concept
[1:13:15] set you free is something outside of you
[1:13:26] like a prisoner in praising
[1:13:29] and
[1:13:30] and the praising god set him free
[1:13:36] praise the lord
[1:13:40] but make you free
[1:13:44] is something that empowers you
[1:13:50] it empowers you
[1:13:53] to be able to break loose
[1:14:00] hallelujah are we together
[1:14:08] and so as we look at the thought tonight
[1:14:15] uh
[1:14:18] i don't know it was something i was
[1:14:20] listening to in and that that just
[1:14:22] captured my mind and
[1:14:24] and i decided i said well let me look
[1:14:25] look in the scripture and look look at
[1:14:27] it a little bit
[1:14:29] and and and they have there there are
[1:14:31] few
[1:14:32] you know uh uh
[1:14:34] biblical reference that we can we can
[1:14:37] kind of look at tonight
[1:14:39] that will
[1:14:41] you know that that will also
[1:14:44] look at and you realize that even paul
[1:14:47] over in the book of romans you know he
[1:14:49] talked about the lord how christ has
[1:14:52] made us free
[1:14:55] from the lord of sin and death
[1:14:59] he didn't set us free he made us free
[1:15:05] praise the lord
[1:15:07] so you see that's that is that is the
[1:15:10] place where
[1:15:11] uh religion becomes dangerous
[1:15:14] because a person can practice all the
[1:15:17] religious right and everything you know
[1:15:20] everything the church has taught them
[1:15:23] praise the lord
[1:15:25] they can dress right and try to live
[1:15:27] right and you know and says i'm i'm not
[1:15:30] like them you know i'm i'm not like
[1:15:32] those sinners i'm not like those
[1:15:34] denominations
[1:15:37] you are just set free
[1:15:42] for a while you can walk in that
[1:15:45] but pretty soon you realize there's a
[1:15:47] nature within
[1:15:51] that is still longing for the things of
[1:15:54] the world
[1:15:58] praise the lord
[1:16:02] that's what jesus said i i i mean john
[1:16:06] testified that in john chapter one he
[1:16:09] came unto his own and his own receiving
[1:16:11] that but as many that has received him
[1:16:14] to them have he gave him power
[1:16:20] so you see the world that we listen to
[1:16:22] young people empower us
[1:16:25] to be able to deal with the sin nature
[1:16:28] inside
[1:16:29] because the word want to make you free
[1:16:33] not set you free
[1:16:36] that's why you find many people they can
[1:16:39] walk in in righteousness and holiness
[1:16:42] for 20 years they've been set free from
[1:16:44] 20 years and then after 20 years to go
[1:16:47] right back
[1:16:49] into the bonus of sin and say i no
[1:16:51] longer believe this message this message
[1:16:54] kept me in punish you were not made free
[1:16:59] you were just set free
[1:17:11] oh glory to god tonight
[1:17:15] i don't want to preach i just want to
[1:17:16] encourage you
[1:17:18] praise the lord
[1:17:20] i just want to encourage you
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:24] i just want to encourage you you see
[1:17:26] this word brother branham said in the
[1:17:28] church book it has the creative power of
[1:17:32] god
[1:17:33] for everything was made by him
[1:17:38] him the logos the word
[1:17:41] this word has the creative power
[1:17:49] that's the reason why we must not
[1:17:51] underestimate the word of god we must
[1:17:52] not play the word of god down we must
[1:17:55] give the word the highest reverence
[1:18:01] because this word
[1:18:03] has that's what brother brahm says god
[1:18:05] says let there be he says it will have
[1:18:07] it it could have taken many years
[1:18:10] that's
[1:18:14] praise the lord
[1:18:17] the bible says he he predestinated us in
[1:18:20] christ to be to be to be conformed to
[1:18:23] his image
[1:18:25] to walk before him in love
[1:18:28] praise the lord
[1:18:30] amen his thoughts
[1:18:32] went forth even before the apostle paul
[1:18:34] wrote it there in ephesians
[1:18:37] isaiah says his word goes out and don't
[1:18:40] return back to him when that word goes
[1:18:42] out is is it's a process
[1:18:47] it's a process
[1:18:50] just like the portal when he's when he's
[1:18:52] making he's making something out of the
[1:18:54] clay it's a process
[1:18:58] he keeps smalling it he keeps smalling
[1:19:00] it
[1:19:01] and that's that's what that's that's
[1:19:03] that's the way that god is working on us
[1:19:08] that's the reason why you can you can
[1:19:10] just hear one message and you say what
[1:19:12] i'm adopted
[1:19:14] it's a process
[1:19:18] praise the lord
[1:19:19] sometimes it looks like you're on the
[1:19:21] housetop you are on fire for god before
[1:19:24] you realize he brings you back again and
[1:19:26] he mows you and he mows you is the
[1:19:28] making process
[1:19:29] [Music]
[1:19:31] he's making you freed
[1:19:38] the church can only set you free for the
[1:19:40] wine
[1:19:41] with crease and dark man
[1:19:43] in our church we don't do this in our
[1:19:45] church we don't do in the message we
[1:19:47] don't do this
[1:19:50] and we can be set free for the y
[1:19:57] but when the word make you free
[1:20:00] you are free
[1:20:02] indeed
[1:20:05] you are freed from inside
[1:20:08] indeed
[1:20:13] praise the lord
[1:20:15] amen
[1:20:17] oh man
[1:20:18] there's just a lot of things coming to
[1:20:19] my head tonight but there's no time for
[1:20:21] it
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:24] there is no time for it now watch here
[1:20:26] now watch him
[1:20:28] that this the the pharisees said unto
[1:20:30] him verse 33 they answer him
[1:20:34] we be abraham's seed
[1:20:37] and will never
[1:20:39] in bondage
[1:20:43] to any man
[1:20:46] praise the lord
[1:20:48] how serious doubt
[1:20:51] ye shall be mystery
[1:20:57] now you see they talk they their natural
[1:21:01] blood lineage
[1:21:04] because they were of the 12 tribes
[1:21:07] of israel from the 12 sons of jacob
[1:21:10] jacob from isaac isaac from abraham
[1:21:13] they can be able to trace it back
[1:21:16] praise the lord
[1:21:18] like many love to do around the message
[1:21:21] you know my pastor was seeing this
[1:21:22] church and and his pastor was in this
[1:21:24] church and you know and brother branham
[1:21:26] visited that church just just to be able
[1:21:28] to trace it back for some sense of rank
[1:21:34] praise the lord so you see they were
[1:21:35] looking at the unnatural lineage
[1:21:42] and saying now
[1:21:45] we are abraham's seat
[1:21:49] praise the lord
[1:21:52] and we were never in bondage
[1:21:57] because to them
[1:22:00] they believed that
[1:22:02] they were set free
[1:22:05] now you see for the very for the very
[1:22:07] fact that they use the word bondage
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:15] they are saying we are abraham's seed
[1:22:18] and were never in bondage
[1:22:23] praise the lord
[1:22:24] so the the language that jesus used
[1:22:28] that you shall be
[1:22:30] made free
[1:22:31] confuse them
[1:22:36] a confused them
[1:22:41] because if jesus was
[1:22:44] implying that they were in bondage
[1:22:47] the right language was going to be you
[1:22:49] would be set free
[1:22:58] so they were confused
[1:23:00] well i mean
[1:23:02] you know we we we are abraham's seed
[1:23:05] we were never embarrassed you see uh
[1:23:08] saint john chapter 8 is a very wonderful
[1:23:10] wonderful chapter
[1:23:12] you have time just just read the whole
[1:23:13] thing it's just so wonderful when you
[1:23:15] read it
[1:23:16] because you will see the very same thing
[1:23:19] when jesus
[1:23:20] was saying to them that you are of your
[1:23:23] father the devil
[1:23:25] praise the lord
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:32] let me know let's find the verse there
[1:23:35] let me let's let's let's pick that up
[1:23:42] praise the lord
[1:23:45] verse 44.
[1:24:08] praise the lord
[1:24:25] i want you
[1:24:29] okay now let's let's go back let's go
[1:24:31] back up a little bit
[1:24:34] let's go back up
[1:24:40] they are saying abraham's seed and jesus
[1:24:42] says verse 36 if the son therefore shall
[1:24:45] make you free you shall be freed indeed
[1:24:47] he says
[1:24:48] i know that ye are abraham's seed
[1:24:53] but you seek to kill me because my word
[1:24:56] have no place in you
[1:24:58] that's that's a place that you can also
[1:25:00] underline
[1:25:02] you know so that that was that was what
[1:25:05] they couldn't grab
[1:25:07] you know jesus was speaking in another
[1:25:10] dimension and they were just
[1:25:11] understanding this so physical
[1:25:13] physically just like nicodemus how can a
[1:25:16] man goes back in his mother womb the
[1:25:18] second time
[1:25:19] amen jesus was speaking in the rain
[1:25:24] of the new birth and they were they were
[1:25:26] looking at it physically as i speak that
[1:25:28] which i've seen with my father and yet
[1:25:31] do that which you have seen
[1:25:33] with your father they answered
[1:25:36] uh and said unto him abraham is our
[1:25:38] father jesus said unto them if ye were
[1:25:41] abraham's children you will
[1:25:44] do the works of abraham
[1:25:47] but
[1:25:48] now
[1:25:49] you seek to kill
[1:25:51] me a man
[1:25:53] that have told you the truth which i
[1:25:56] have heard of god
[1:25:59] this did not abraham
[1:26:04] you do the deeds of your father
[1:26:08] then said they
[1:26:10] to him
[1:26:12] we be now born of a fornication
[1:26:17] we have one father even god
[1:26:20] now so so uh you you you can you can
[1:26:24] plainly see the sepancy right here
[1:26:27] because
[1:26:28] what what brings your mind i mean jesus
[1:26:31] talking about you know abraham if
[1:26:34] abraham was your father you know what uh
[1:26:37] you know you have done the works of
[1:26:39] abraham but then pretty soon
[1:26:42] their minds goes back to talk about
[1:26:44] world i mean god is our father we are
[1:26:46] not born out of fun i mean fornication
[1:26:49] you know in all of that
[1:26:51] take the thought of relating god is our
[1:26:55] father and we are not born of
[1:26:57] fornication
[1:27:01] praise the lord
[1:27:03] the thought runs deep is not that
[1:27:05] fornication is not in the sense of their
[1:27:07] natural breath
[1:27:09] it's not in the sense of the breath with
[1:27:11] their parents
[1:27:12] is more than there because here jesus is
[1:27:15] talking about abraham that have lived
[1:27:17] hundreds of years before even
[1:27:20] they came on the scene
[1:27:23] praise the lord now so what i wanted to
[1:27:25] show you here is is in the same sense of
[1:27:28] word jesus uh
[1:27:31] uh uh uh saying the truth shall make you
[1:27:34] free and then they come on the scene and
[1:27:36] says well we were not in bondage
[1:27:39] what are you talking about us being
[1:27:41] made free
[1:27:43] yeah jesus talking about if abraham was
[1:27:46] your father you would have done the work
[1:27:48] of abraham then quickly the comments
[1:27:50] said but we're not born
[1:27:51] out of fornication god is our father
[1:27:56] praise the lord
[1:27:58] amen now so you see that uh uh as as
[1:28:02] they were listening to jesus they're
[1:28:03] beginning to see that this god is
[1:28:06] talking he's talking about something
[1:28:09] far deeper than we can understand
[1:28:12] amen and you see that is the thing of
[1:28:15] the of the word that is the thing of of
[1:28:17] of truth
[1:28:21] that is the thing of truth
[1:28:25] you see truth is not just a concept
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:31] truth is not just a concept
[1:28:39] truth is a person
[1:28:43] amen
[1:28:45] amen
[1:28:46] i love the way someone said it he said
[1:28:48] is when the word
[1:28:50] and the deed
[1:28:52] i may won
[1:28:56] you can say the word
[1:28:58] you can read what is from the bible as
[1:29:01] the truth
[1:29:02] but when
[1:29:04] the days of your life comes into
[1:29:06] question
[1:29:08] then it makes the person that is
[1:29:09] listening to that truth to wonder is the
[1:29:12] truth
[1:29:13] amen amen
[1:29:17] are we together
[1:29:20] praise the lord
[1:29:22] now so you see here the uh uh uh the
[1:29:26] truth
[1:29:28] the truth
[1:29:31] is the word is is is is god
[1:29:34] that is that is embodied in his word
[1:29:40] it has the power
[1:29:44] to make us
[1:29:46] free
[1:29:49] praise the lord
[1:29:51] the truth is not
[1:29:53] what you say
[1:29:56] the truth is what god said
[1:30:04] praise the lord
[1:30:07] it's what god said
[1:30:09] now when when we bring our life to line
[1:30:13] up with what god says
[1:30:15] when we embrace what god says
[1:30:19] praise the lord amen
[1:30:24] then we get into the making process
[1:30:29] praise the lord
[1:30:32] then we get into the making process
[1:30:37] this message
[1:30:39] was not to set us free
[1:30:43] it was to make us free
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] it was not to set us aside to be
[1:30:53] different from all the other churches
[1:30:58] give us a certain dress code a setting
[1:31:00] look
[1:31:05] praise the lord
[1:31:08] people i i think you know that you you
[1:31:11] believe the word and
[1:31:13] and and then you know you accept the
[1:31:15] lord jesus you believe the message of
[1:31:17] the hour
[1:31:19] but yet you
[1:31:21] you struggle the bible says jesus was
[1:31:24] called the friend of warren bevers
[1:31:29] amen
[1:31:30] because he was the truth
[1:31:32] he had what it takes to make them free
[1:31:36] praise the lord
[1:31:38] amen
[1:31:39] he was not he was not struggling he was
[1:31:42] not
[1:31:44] like embarrassed you know looking over
[1:31:46] his shoulders when i mean when he's when
[1:31:48] he with the common people praise the
[1:31:50] lord like the pharisees would do
[1:31:52] the pharisees were the ones that were
[1:31:54] always looking over their shoulder
[1:31:55] because they are
[1:31:57] their their religion
[1:31:59] set them apart
[1:32:01] so they cannot associate with certain
[1:32:04] group of people
[1:32:12] praise the lord
[1:32:17] this word this mess it has what it takes
[1:32:20] to get among any class of people
[1:32:27] praise the lord
[1:32:29] that's the reason why the apostle paul
[1:32:31] who says you know it was not a problem
[1:32:34] to be among the barbarians it was not a
[1:32:36] problem to be among the greeks i mean
[1:32:39] it have what it takes
[1:32:47] because it make you free
[1:32:53] amen
[1:32:56] they make you free
[1:32:59] praise the lord
[1:33:02] you read the word you you you you listen
[1:33:04] to the word you enjoy the word you get
[1:33:07] among
[1:33:08] uh the wrong company and then pretty
[1:33:10] soon you start feeling funny
[1:33:13] you know then you know that you need to
[1:33:15] get back on the mold
[1:33:18] you need some working to be done there's
[1:33:20] a work to be done
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:24] the the the holy spirit starts to
[1:33:26] witness to you that there is a character
[1:33:28] work to be done
[1:33:37] because if you have you have christ in
[1:33:40] you
[1:33:41] the one that makes free
[1:33:46] the very sense that you are ashamed of
[1:33:48] him
[1:33:49] means that you are not free
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:58] praise the lord
[1:34:00] you take your take our uh you know our
[1:34:02] our
[1:34:04] our uh
[1:34:06] pademic situation that we went through
[1:34:09] you know
[1:34:10] everybody was quickly to share what they
[1:34:12] were doing this is this is the way i'm
[1:34:14] dealing with this you know because you
[1:34:16] try it work for you you want to share
[1:34:18] with everybody
[1:34:20] this is what i'm doing you know i'm i'm
[1:34:22] i'm i'm i'm drinking lamb i'm eating
[1:34:25] fruits i'm taking my vitamins you know
[1:34:27] everybody because you realize that it
[1:34:29] helps you
[1:34:37] amen
[1:34:41] praise the lord
[1:34:48] a man that is that is freed and ashamed
[1:34:51] to testify that he's free there is
[1:34:53] problem that's a serious problem with
[1:34:54] him
[1:34:56] he's in more bondage
[1:34:58] than being locked up in the praising
[1:35:03] amen
[1:35:04] you see the enemy tried to to praising
[1:35:07] us in our spirit man you have to
[1:35:09] remember brother brahma says he's uh
[1:35:11] he's uh uh uh he's the prince of the
[1:35:13] power of the earth that's why paul says
[1:35:16] in ephesians
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:26] he's the prince of the power of the head
[1:35:28] and and we have to realize that uh uh uh
[1:35:32] you know our our spirit man
[1:35:35] our spirit man the complexity of our
[1:35:38] spirit name the things that we deal with
[1:35:40] in our affection and our memory and our
[1:35:43] reasoning is all birth
[1:35:46] from the devil
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:51] and that is the place where he seek to
[1:35:55] imprison us
[1:35:59] amen
[1:36:01] and that is the very same place where
[1:36:03] the word is working to make you free
[1:36:09] amen
[1:36:10] to free you from the condemnation of
[1:36:13] your memory
[1:36:15] you can remember some things
[1:36:18] but you don't feel condemned in as much
[1:36:20] as you regret you are not condemned
[1:36:22] because the word makes you free
[1:36:33] praise the lord now if the word does not
[1:36:35] make you free you are not in prison but
[1:36:38] every time the devil stared there
[1:36:40] oh me oh my goodness
[1:36:43] oh yeah
[1:36:44] okay okay
[1:36:46] what you are you are imprisoned in your
[1:36:48] spirit
[1:36:53] he used your memory he used your
[1:36:55] affection he used your reasoning
[1:36:57] to imprison you
[1:37:01] oh that's why the apostle paul says the
[1:37:03] word is sharper than the two-edged sword
[1:37:06] going to the dividing asunder
[1:37:09] of the spirit in the soul
[1:37:12] so the word goes right in there
[1:37:16] you see the word does not it does not
[1:37:20] liberate you only it does not cut you
[1:37:23] free from that think
[1:37:25] but you see
[1:37:26] it explain to you
[1:37:30] it tell you my child you bypass your
[1:37:32] tear funny
[1:37:33] your original nature you bypass it
[1:37:37] you were set in that situation to be
[1:37:39] tempted
[1:37:42] then you look i said really me
[1:37:46] then you see now the understanding of
[1:37:48] that
[1:37:51] frees you
[1:37:56] praise the lord
[1:37:58] just the understanding of that frees you
[1:38:07] so the word
[1:38:10] makes you free
[1:38:13] you see that over and over and over in
[1:38:16] the scripture
[1:38:18] it's already nine o'clock i don't want
[1:38:20] to take much time tonight
[1:38:22] but you see they're over over and over
[1:38:25] all in the scripture it's just all over
[1:38:27] the place
[1:38:28] our christ has made us free
[1:38:36] he has made us free
[1:38:44] praise the lord
[1:38:45] well you might think uh you know that
[1:38:47] brother one are you playing on words no
[1:38:48] i'm not playing on words
[1:38:53] i'm not playing on wars
[1:38:59] praise the lord
[1:39:01] because brother branham says i think in
[1:39:03] the same that church is there in the
[1:39:04] church book he says that creative voice
[1:39:07] of god
[1:39:09] is changing the atoms of our body
[1:39:18] as we are receiving the word
[1:39:22] so you see when people
[1:39:24] try to make the message all about
[1:39:26] brother branham and try to make the
[1:39:27] message oh this message you know it's
[1:39:30] not for everybody if god can save you he
[1:39:33] can save anybody
[1:39:37] if god can save you
[1:39:39] or me
[1:39:41] because i don't know about you i know
[1:39:43] myself
[1:39:44] if god can save me
[1:39:46] he can save anybody
[1:39:49] praise the lord
[1:39:51] and then we cut people off and says oh
[1:39:53] no you see that they are denominational
[1:39:56] nope
[1:39:59] we have just been set free
[1:40:02] that's what some of the horrible things
[1:40:04] you hear people do around the message
[1:40:06] you say wow
[1:40:07] i mean if god have not make you free you
[1:40:09] will run away from this message
[1:40:13] you will run away
[1:40:15] you will say well it's not different
[1:40:17] from from any other group
[1:40:36] yes i know the truth
[1:40:39] and the truth shy
[1:40:42] make you free
[1:40:44] can we say that together tonight
[1:40:46] yes i know the truth
[1:40:48] and the truth shall
[1:40:50] make you free
[1:40:54] praise the lord
[1:40:58] the truth is making us free
[1:41:04] there is delivering power in this world
[1:41:08] praise the lord
[1:41:09] young people there is enough power in
[1:41:12] this world
[1:41:15] to deal with our habits
[1:41:19] praise the lord
[1:41:21] that's the reason why that prophet of
[1:41:22] god can say
[1:41:24] the reason why we come to church
[1:41:26] is to be a better son of god
[1:41:28] is to be a better daughter of god
[1:41:31] be a better son to your parents
[1:41:33] better parents to your children
[1:41:36] better husband to your wife
[1:41:38] why because the word has the power to
[1:41:41] make you
[1:41:46] very very good
[1:41:49] baby
[1:42:01] the lord bless you tonight
[1:42:03] musicians you can come let's buy our
[1:42:05] heads
[1:42:26] the bible says god make man in his image
[1:42:31] amen
[1:42:33] the bible say he make man in his image
[1:42:40] that's the reason why paul says if any
[1:42:43] man being christ is a new creature
[1:42:46] all things have passed away behold
[1:42:48] all things are new
[1:42:50] we are in the making process

[1:44:03] the church will set you free for a while
