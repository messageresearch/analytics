[25:24] Hey
[25:26] [Music]
[25:46] right
[25:56] for you
[26:22] let's sing that one more time to him
[26:25] tonight
[26:26] [Music]
[26:45] we made
[26:47] [Music]
[28:02] you are a blessing that one more time
[28:05] yes
[28:07] [Music]
[28:34] let's approach to be prayer tonight was
[28:44] listening in to a testimony today that
[28:47] really moved me this young woman was
[28:53] going through a lot so much that the
[28:56] hymn of mind a good Christian woman she
[29:01] has some trouble in her home and then
[29:07] she was dealing with this pain such a
[29:10] pain she was dealing with and she didn't
[29:12] even know what the pain went to the
[29:13] doctor and she thought there because of
[29:19] the emotional stress that she was
[29:21] dealing with she thought it was that
[29:24] emotional stress that was making her to
[29:27] feel her body in such a pain and it did
[29:31] a check and according fine what was
[29:36] happening to hurting but I mean she was
[29:39] in severe pain and she went back again
[29:41] they did another check they couldn't
[29:43] find what was happening so she started
[29:45] praying she said Lord I'm not making
[29:47] this up is this just in my mind and then
[29:55] after the wide there was a surgeon that
[29:59] sent for her looking our order for
[30:02] medical report and he decided that he
[30:07] should do another test on her and when
[30:12] they did that test the final that her
[30:19] calling was bad
[30:23] and they had to rush her immediately
[30:26] into surgery she's dealing with all of
[30:31] this thing happening in her home and now
[30:39] she had to deal with a health situation
[30:42] so she was in the hospital for a couple
[30:43] of days
[30:48] and the doctors came back and they
[30:56] brought order reporting you know after
[30:59] it did the soldering because when the
[31:05] surgeon sent for her they had to keep
[31:07] her in a hospital for a couple of days
[31:09] before actually they did the surgery so
[31:14] the doctor said to her there you have to
[31:19] time God for your pins because when the
[31:26] brother in the world
[31:27] they were giving her muffin and
[31:29] different pain meds to be able to cool
[31:32] the pain and she said the doctor said if
[31:37] the pain who have society and you have
[31:42] decided to go home she could have died
[31:46] in her sleep and the only reason why
[31:55] they never allowed her to go home is
[31:58] because she was in pain and she was
[32:01] complaining about popping she was
[32:05] speaking out for peace
[32:09] so she said her own words she said i sat
[32:17] there then I said god I did not
[32:20] understood everything I was crying and
[32:22] saying why I have to go through this but
[32:25] I thank you for my pains

[40:43] going to sing John chapter 9 tonight
[40:46] just for this prayer meeting
[41:05] since John chapter 9 something caught my
[41:11] attention in their chapter then I
[41:17] started reading it and another things
[41:21] came to my mind so just want to shared a
[41:24] little bit with you tonight and as Jesus
[41:32] passed by he saw a man which was blind
[41:37] from his birth and his disciple acts him
[41:41] saying master who did sin this man or
[41:46] his parents that he was born blind and
[41:51] jesus answered neither have this man
[41:55] seen known his parents but that the
[41:59] works of God should be made manifest in
[42:03] him I must work the work of him that
[42:09] sent me while it is day the night cometh
[42:13] when no man can work as long as I am in
[42:19] work and the light of the world when he
[42:26] had thus spoken he spit on the ground
[42:30] and made a clay with the spatter and he
[42:36] annoyed the eyes of the blind man with
[42:41] the clay and said unto him go wash in
[42:46] the pool of Siloam which is by
[42:51] interpretation to same interpretation
[42:55] same he went his way therefore and watch
[43:01] and came see praise the Lord
[43:09] let's pray father in the name of the
[43:13] Lord Jesus we approach you tonight by
[43:18] your word Lord just as you said why you
[43:23] were here that we you must work why it
[43:27] is day the law we want to do the same or
[43:31] father while we have birth while we have
[43:34] strength in us Oh God
[43:36] wife are the law we are in a wall I will
[43:40] write mine
[43:41] help us Lord to do the work of God to do
[43:45] the works of God to do those things a
[43:48] law that you have required of us father
[43:50] we just pray the Lord you will bless
[43:53] this few verses that we read tonight and
[43:57] oh god we pray that grace we take a
[44:00] portion for each heart tonight father we
[44:02] love you and we appreciate you in Jesus
[44:06] name we pray amen praise the Lord Allah
[44:09] bless you you may have your seat Amy I
[44:15] was speaking on something on Sunday
[44:20] children in the marketplace in and you
[44:28] know trying to bring a thought of how we
[44:31] are all children a God's children and
[44:35] God is exposing us to his greatness
[44:40] you know he's exposing us to his healing
[44:43] so his own importance power I mean all
[44:48] of these things they should not be think
[44:51] that they are nothing they are behind
[44:53] the curtains for us they are things as
[44:56] children of God that we have the right
[44:58] to praise the Lord and like the proper
[45:01] God said God want us to be happy
[45:04] amen so he want us to have healing in
[45:08] the camp he want us to have a
[45:10] deliverance in the cam he want us to
[45:12] have joy in the camp and he want us he
[45:15] just want us to be happy praise the Lord
[45:18] so even in our trials we can
[45:20] happy because God want us to be happy
[45:22] amen we understand their trials and that
[45:27] and that actually punishment from God
[45:29] but he's using their to build character
[45:32] we were appreciate when we go through
[45:34] try as him in praise the Lord amen we
[45:39] were always appreciated and realized
[45:41] that is adding something to our life
[45:44] praise the Lord so but I I got attracted
[45:48] to this structure I was I was just
[45:50] meditating on it and and just to see
[45:53] that Jesus we will get to that in a
[45:58] little bit here because I have thought
[46:00] of some few things what brother Branham
[46:02] said that he says Jesus who have been
[46:04] arrested amen for spitting on the ground
[46:08] and putting it on the clients eyes that
[46:12] was completely against the medical code
[46:16] amen praise the Lord amen he will you
[46:22] have been arrested they will have Bonnie
[46:25] a mother and putting me in praise and
[46:27] praise the Lord but we would get to
[46:29] there tonight I put a few coats I mean a
[46:32] coat of a brother branham Express there
[46:34] but what what what kind of was a got my
[46:38] attention on this scripture is there
[46:40] Jesus go down to the ground and before I
[46:49] get there my mind my man was just
[46:51] swinging on on something and I just
[46:54] thought because it's a prayer meeting
[46:55] tonight let me just let me just speak on
[46:58] this why we find a little time to pray
[47:01] and hope that the law would be able to
[47:04] help me to be able to approach the
[47:06] Wednesday night like this you know where
[47:08] we can just find some time to pray if it
[47:11] is just some 5-10 minutes where we can
[47:13] be able to pray together amen praise the
[47:16] Lord and don't don't be afraid to
[47:18] express yourself during that time city
[47:20] out of your heart amen
[47:21] we can all have good
[47:24] probably prayer life but it's a blessing
[47:27] when we come together amen
[47:29] and just have that time to get aware we
[47:32] can pray together we all can live for
[47:35] our voice to the Father together and the
[47:38] beautiful thing there is that he
[47:39] listening to each and every one of us
[47:42] individually praise the Lord and it's so
[47:47] beautiful when all the children are
[47:50] crying at the same time for attention I
[47:55] mean but what I was thinking about as I
[48:01] was driving all throughout the day I was
[48:05] thinking about the restored image that
[48:07] was what I was going to speak on tonight
[48:09] a little bit how to restore a fallen
[48:13] man's image and a my mic himm to that
[48:17] because of this in this structure here
[48:19] the disciple asks Jesus that question
[48:22] because sickness was always attached to
[48:26] sing praise the Lord amen of a truth is
[48:29] an attribute of sin if there was no sin
[48:32] there will be no sickness so in the Old
[48:35] Testament or through our before our Lord
[48:38] Jesus came and started teaching this way
[48:41] whenever there was someone that was born
[48:44] blind or there was someone that had some
[48:47] kind of a sickness you know in the
[48:49] family they will always think that maybe
[48:53] the the husband have done something and
[48:55] he never told a wife about it or maybe
[48:58] the wife or if it searched himself and
[49:01] opened ear has to one another any day
[49:03] now find anything quickly they will run
[49:05] down and go and see maybe it's the same
[49:08] of our parents that is visiting us do
[49:10] you know anything your parents have done
[49:12] always you I mean they have always
[49:15] attributed a sickness to sing praise the
[49:19] Lord
[49:22] and-and-and-and and to see that
[49:28] Jesus even though it was spoken and
[49:31] prophesied of him that he will he will
[49:33] heal the brokenhearted he was becoming
[49:35] well from with a ministry healing in his
[49:38] wings but yet whenever he will associate
[49:42] himself with somebody that is that is a
[49:45] sick or unfortunate there will always be
[49:50] this kind of a drawback approach from
[49:53] the disciples now they were acting like
[49:56] that because that was the way they were
[49:58] taught
[49:58] so until until they are taught better
[50:02] and God brings a transformation in their
[50:05] mind the things that we are taught it
[50:08] makes a big part of our lives praise the
[50:13] Lord
[50:14] amen and sometimes when those things
[50:17] happen is hard for us to I mean it is
[50:20] part of our life even on unconsciously
[50:27] sometimes we respond to certain
[50:29] situation just based on the way we have
[50:36] been taught praise the Lord
[50:41] so immediately they said to Jesus who
[50:45] seen it seen his parents or as he is
[50:48] seen they have him in that condition
[50:50] because that is the way they were
[50:52] thought but Jesus comes and also their
[50:57] question is neither the men that have
[51:00] seen is neither his parents they have
[51:04] seen but God allowed the situation just
[51:08] to glorify himself praise the Lord
[51:13] now I mean we can sit tonight and say
[51:17] Amen it was not it was not that easy for
[51:19] the disciples to just see it like that
[51:23] immediate Laura be to God now we
[51:25] understand it praise the Lord and I
[51:32] believe that is that is the thing that
[51:34] the grace of God is taking every one of
[51:37] us trooper Brandon sherry he said the
[51:39] hardest thing that our fire
[51:41] in the campaign is to get people from
[51:43] all teachings that's what he said to get
[51:49] people from all teachings because we
[51:56] grow up in those belief systems and and
[51:58] and and and and sometimes even even when
[52:02] a better understanding is coming you say
[52:05] oh I see it but I'm still holding on I
[52:09] see it I'm still holding on praise the
[52:13] Lord Amen the rapture would bring our
[52:17] total deliverance he made me now but I
[52:25] was thinking about this in and and to
[52:28] see that Jesus got down to the ground I
[52:32] mean he spit on the ground and he may
[52:34] declare that III mean it was a message
[52:38] it was it was not a it was not a
[52:41] addition thing but he made a clearing
[52:44] and miss the dust with his face put on
[52:47] this man eyes and told him to go and
[52:50] watch now it was just that little girl
[52:54] in watch my mind was a little bit cut
[52:57] into death that there is something every
[53:01] one of us have to do I mean Jesus put
[53:07] the clay on his eyes the man is blind
[53:12] and yura said he had made a thick clay
[53:16] put it on his eye and tell him go and
[53:18] watch praise the Lord he he can see in
[53:26] the first place and you have double the
[53:30] the darkness for him and yet you tell
[53:35] him to go and watch because there is a
[53:39] work for him to do we will not just lay
[53:46] there and God says now you have overcome
[53:49] there is something for you to do no
[53:53] matter what you are
[53:55] with the grace of God comes down and
[53:57] bring an honor standing on the Word of
[53:59] God the grace of God comes down and
[54:01] rebuked the enemy but there is something
[54:04] that you have to do concerning that
[54:06] situation when he got to the throne of
[54:10] Lazarus he told a merely matter he said
[54:14] ruled the stone away because there is
[54:18] something that we have to do and that is
[54:22] the thing that brings God on the scene
[54:26] praise the Lord
[54:28] his works according to the scripture is
[54:30] a finished work from the foundation of
[54:33] the world
[54:34] amen but for their finish word to be
[54:37] manifested in our body he want us to be
[54:41] a partner he don't call us to be
[54:46] observers he called us to be partners
[54:50] that is the reason why he gave us his
[54:53] spirit he want us to be proud of it are
[55:00] we together
[55:03] I've seen your glasses man I said what
[55:07] is India Jesus telling him go and watch
[55:10] because the work is done
[55:13] amen he already said I must work why it
[55:17] is day then I come and no man worketh
[55:22] this man now because of his sin that God
[55:26] that the works of God should be made
[55:31] manifest praise the Lord
[55:38] now if it is the work of God wish of
[55:41] course it's the work of God to be made
[55:42] manifest all the glory belongs to God
[55:45] Jesus who have just put the spit on his
[55:48] hand
[55:48] hold his hand carry him down there take
[55:51] the water wash your face open your eyes
[55:53] can you see me now
[56:04] but he does not only want to be
[56:06] glorified in a man that prey for the
[56:10] sake you also want to be glorified in
[56:12] the one that have faith to believe for
[56:14] their healing because there is a work
[56:19] that we all have to do praise the Lord
[56:24] amen so I was thinking about this
[56:28] restored image a little bit but let me
[56:33] net I mean that's for the night because
[56:35] I don't have enough time praise the Lord
[56:37] so let's just read a little bit of let's
[56:42] read something he had a blood brand sale
[56:44] on this particular verse that we read
[56:46] tonight praise the Lord
[56:57] he starts here talking from the message
[57:02] let's read this one ever-present water
[57:06] 1961 and he says I'm waiting for a man
[57:09] to jump on to mean again about something
[57:14] someone came to me now loan a gold and
[57:18] saying the very idea that Christ spit on
[57:22] the ground of Christ spitting on the
[57:26] ground with his pee and make a cake and
[57:29] and and and smelling it over somebody's
[57:35] eyes said how filthy dirty that was for
[57:41] him to spit with his feet out of his
[57:44] mouth how unsanitary it was to spit in
[57:50] dirt and make a market and put it over a
[57:53] man's eyes praise the Lord I said but he
[57:59] came back seeing amen
[58:04] he came back seeing praise the Lord Amen
[58:10] no matter what God would have to do to
[58:12] bring us to where he want to bring us
[58:15] that the thing that is important is that
[58:17] we are there amen praise Lord His grace
[58:21] has brought us there
[58:22] then he took on this he says seeing the
[58:27] other said they open up and you just
[58:32] come up there by my place there are a
[58:37] swimming pool a man and that man man's
[58:42] got a ticket for every one of his
[58:45] children to go down there and and swim
[58:48] in the pool and he and his wife goes to
[58:51] excuse me my sister but were them women
[58:56] with the swimming pool about a hundreds
[58:59] of them and you're talking about all of
[59:00] these water pools and things and what
[59:03] what actually brother branham is trying
[59:05] to address here as we read in a called
[59:07] if if you know in a way that the hymn of
[59:13] mine in the way they age especially with
[59:18] us having a small assembling we have
[59:20] always served our communion from the
[59:23] same cow
[59:25] praise the Lord I know we found out
[59:29] sometimes they bother people mind amen
[59:34] praise the Lord
[59:35] and sometimes they bother people mind
[59:38] because we are drinking from the same
[59:40] cup well that's that was the way that
[59:43] Jesus did it praise the Lord and when he
[59:45] when we get to the place word we I mean
[59:48] we are normally ourselves we have to go
[59:50] to use small cups there is nothing wrong
[59:52] with that either
[59:54] are we together amen the people using
[59:57] small cups are not in the wrong
[1:00:01] I mean it's just the same praise the
[1:00:04] Lord
[1:00:05] but it is because of sometimes the way
[1:00:09] our society defects our mind it must not
[1:00:13] break the principle of God's Word and we
[1:00:17] together so brother Branham is using
[1:00:20] that if if a man who see that he's
[1:00:23] talking about this very man now that
[1:00:26] have bought a ticket to take his his
[1:00:28] entire family to a water park or a
[1:00:30] swimming pool whatever it is praise the
[1:00:33] Lord he's the very one now that is
[1:00:35] condemning our Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:00:38] opening a may eyes when he's carrying
[1:00:42] this of his family to go and expose them
[1:00:45] their nakedness to the world he's
[1:00:48] condemning our Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:00:50] healing the man praise the Lord
[1:00:54] you see where the principle goes amen
[1:00:57] that's what he's addressing here and he
[1:01:02] talks about all the filth and things and
[1:01:04] and and women a man today watching
[1:01:06] around in the water and filtered and
[1:01:08] dead in their mouths and they're
[1:01:10] swirling in and spitting it out I just I
[1:01:12] just I I just want him to jump on me
[1:01:16] they said if Christ was living today
[1:01:20] they didn't have him arrested on the
[1:01:23] account of an unsanitary thing and it's
[1:01:27] not a joke it's not a joke I was
[1:01:30] listening to one one Christmas program
[1:01:35] one time some years ago driving and
[1:01:38] listening to any sis well you know what
[1:01:40] for the scripture saying in Isaiah
[1:01:43] chapter 53 that it pleased God for his
[1:01:49] son to be brought in today's society is
[1:01:53] child abuse do you see how the people
[1:01:59] want to rewrite this holy scripture and
[1:02:02] take us away from divine principle and
[1:02:06] bring us to a filming civilization what
[1:02:10] they call a civilization that is feeling
[1:02:13] amen a civilization that is bringing us
[1:02:17] the Bislett nature that is a man one
[1:02:22] time when man was on a god civilization
[1:02:25] controlled by the Holy Spirit amen
[1:02:28] even the sealers new decency even the
[1:02:32] man I was not born again he knew decency
[1:02:37] they want to take us from this sacré
[1:02:40] principle praise the Lord
[1:02:46] that's the reason why they are rewriting
[1:02:48] the Bible and getting all the
[1:02:50] translation they want to get we will
[1:02:52] stay with the good ol scripture him
[1:02:57] in-house about that I'm sure you catch
[1:03:01] what I mean the goal right there to the
[1:03:03] 14 and and and many of them would be
[1:03:07] seasoned and all sorts of things and
[1:03:10] everything right in there you are
[1:03:12] spitting it through your mouth and
[1:03:14] everything like they are washing around
[1:03:18] praise the Lord and then yes you will
[1:03:22] blame our Lord Jesus from doing this
[1:03:26] that's not where my mind was worried
[1:03:28] tonight I just read there because I a
[1:03:30] new verb and says something on that but
[1:03:33] I was our just looking at my emphasis
[1:03:36] was Jesus telling him you go and watch
[1:03:39] my work is done
[1:03:42] praise Lord how you find yourself to
[1:03:46] their water go and watch praise the Lord
[1:03:54] and that's what he want us to do he have
[1:03:58] given the promise he has spoken his word
[1:04:01] now you have to make the step you have
[1:04:03] to put the effort for that word to be
[1:04:05] made flesh in you for you to enjoy the
[1:04:09] benefit of this word you must be able to
[1:04:13] go and watch he must be able to make
[1:04:15] make that effort so this word can be a
[1:04:18] living word amen many of the times we
[1:04:26] are haunted by all teachings now he
[1:04:28] takes he takes the same the same taught
[1:04:31] here over this time he went a little bit
[1:04:34] further image of Christ it's a prayer
[1:04:41] meeting tonight so
[1:04:49] that's the only way we we know God is to
[1:04:54] follow the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:58] amen
[1:05:00] is to follow the leading of the Holy
[1:05:03] Spirit and if you think that God is
[1:05:06] leading you to do something do it if God
[1:05:10] is leading you he would bless it if he's
[1:05:12] not blessing to take your hands of him
[1:05:14] because God is not in amen he will not
[1:05:18] had no sorrow to the things that he
[1:05:21] promised to bless you in the only way we
[1:05:25] know to follow God the Linnaean of the
[1:05:28] of the Holy Spirit that olfaction is
[1:05:31] God's program it always has been God's
[1:05:35] program it always will be God's program
[1:05:39] now the power naba might but by my
[1:05:42] spirit says the Lord Amen that's word it
[1:05:47] comes Longfellow
[1:05:51] once said this the way to succeed is to
[1:05:58] find a worthy cause that's been talked
[1:06:02] about a worthy cause that's been talked
[1:06:06] about and then hold on to it
[1:06:08] praise the Lord Amen it's salvation a
[1:06:14] water cause is delivering the water
[1:06:16] cause it's gosta healing is history
[1:06:20] saving if you believe that then hold on
[1:06:22] to it job says I will hold on till my
[1:06:24] change comes you gotta be believing God
[1:06:29] show something that's been talked about
[1:06:31] turn down by science and if is water
[1:06:35] than hold on to it he says do you know
[1:06:38] in 1872 the Medical Association of the
[1:06:43] United States turned down bathtubs
[1:06:46] they said they absolutely on sanitary
[1:06:51] and they said they said they will
[1:06:56] scatter diseases bathtubs they finally
[1:06:59] come to it
[1:07:00] praise the Lord
[1:07:02] and this olfaction gospel there we are
[1:07:09] that that we are talking about watch in
[1:07:13] the blood of the Lamb it may seems
[1:07:18] old-fashioned but they will have to come
[1:07:23] to it sooner or later it's a war because
[1:07:29] hold to it with all you got
[1:07:34] praise the Lord amen well that I don't
[1:07:40] know but I it's like I get a feeling
[1:07:42] that somebody's mind stuck on the
[1:07:44] bathtub it's like somebody is not going
[1:07:49] with me yes they're thinking about it
[1:07:54] praise the Lord brother branham is
[1:07:57] saying your medical science condemned it
[1:08:00] because this era was Netta it was not
[1:08:03] healthy
[1:08:04] Amen but yet they came to it amen so
[1:08:08] wish me they saw a benefit of it
[1:08:11] praise the Lord it means that they saw a
[1:08:15] benefit of it if you clean it it would
[1:08:17] be it would be clean and healthy now so
[1:08:19] he's met his net condemning bathtub
[1:08:24] because that's how people pull their
[1:08:26] letter and make a doctrine he's not
[1:08:28] condemning bathtub he's only saying it
[1:08:31] came out they discuss about it praise
[1:08:35] the Lord but yet they came to realize
[1:08:37] that it has a benefit so he saying it's
[1:08:39] the same thing with the blood watch
[1:08:41] gospel the The Fighter game said they
[1:08:45] spoke against the sentence making you
[1:08:47] all faction you are you I mean that they
[1:08:50] have pleasure in life that you are
[1:08:51] missing that he said but one day they
[1:08:54] will come back to it
[1:08:57] one day they will realize that this is
[1:09:00] the thing that was needed to save the
[1:09:02] world this was the thing that was needed
[1:09:07] to hold their family together to save
[1:09:09] their children from all the street
[1:09:18] so that's why he was talking about so go
[1:09:21] with me now don't stay on the bathtub
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:23] he says the old-fashioned gospel we are
[1:09:26] talking about watching the blood of the
[1:09:29] Lamb
[1:09:29] it may seems old-fashioned but they will
[1:09:33] have to they will have to they will have
[1:09:36] to come to it sooner or later
[1:09:38] it's a water cause hold on to it with
[1:09:43] all you got is a blood watch way amen is
[1:09:49] a blood watch way there like I said
[1:09:53] young people you must thank God for
[1:10:02] grace that have come to you coming your
[1:10:04] way
[1:10:05] amen and you make the best use of it
[1:10:07] praise the Lord
[1:10:08] get closer to God prayed and said lord
[1:10:11] if this Holy Ghost is true I want it
[1:10:21] it's a blog blood wash way-ay-ay claims
[1:10:26] a man up not going out yet drinking and
[1:10:29] smoking and riding around and calling
[1:10:31] himself Kristin because they belong to a
[1:10:34] church because we belong to a church who
[1:10:38] belong to a message Church is not enough
[1:10:41] young people it's not enough old people
[1:10:44] it's not enough brothers and sisters
[1:10:47] amen it's that clean on a daughter yet
[1:10:58] the Holy Ghost in a he must life that
[1:11:02] reflect Jesus Christ the Son of God that
[1:11:05] is God's purpose that is the target he
[1:11:09] want to reflect himself through your
[1:11:12] life he just don't want you to know
[1:11:16] about him he just don't want you to talk
[1:11:20] about him praise the Lord he want you to
[1:11:23] do just like Peter he said Peter Lim in
[1:11:27] your boat and Peter turned the entire
[1:11:30] boat over to him and he jumped in a boat
[1:11:32] and he was able to ride a boat and
[1:11:35] preach a sermon he want you to turn your
[1:11:39] life over he want to do it
[1:11:41] in your life now just to know about him
[1:11:44] and talk about him he want to live
[1:11:46] through you amen
[1:11:49] the Holy Spirit in him a life that
[1:11:52] reflect Jesus Christ the Son of God
[1:11:53] that's why people today reject the new
[1:11:56] birth oh they have got what they call
[1:12:00] the new birth church membership some is
[1:12:07] just I mean I mean just just just get
[1:12:10] you know a decent dress code then not to
[1:12:15] say curse word praise the Lord all of
[1:12:21] those things are good things people but
[1:12:23] we have to know in this age what God has
[1:12:27] given us in this age is a talking life
[1:12:32] amen
[1:12:34] their life has returned back to the body
[1:12:38] I was going to share something with you
[1:12:42] trying to put it together but let me
[1:12:44] give you an idea about it we read a
[1:12:47] little about it on Sunday when brother
[1:12:50] Branham says Jesus was not idle even in
[1:12:52] the in the grave amen
[1:12:55] his body was in the grave but his spirit
[1:13:00] according to 2 Peter first Peter 3 went
[1:13:03] down and preached to the souls in
[1:13:06] praising amen and after he witnessed to
[1:13:11] the souls impressing he went down to the
[1:13:14] region of the loss and took the keys of
[1:13:16] death in Hell from the devil are we
[1:13:21] together
[1:13:32] so his body was lying in the tone but
[1:13:37] his spirit was working praise the Lord
[1:13:44] I'll have to break protocol a little bit
[1:13:47] here there was few minutes here I don't
[1:13:52] have a dad coat back here I didn't send
[1:13:56] it because I was not going into it
[1:13:58] tonight but I'm just going to I'm going
[1:14:01] to I want to teach you a little bit
[1:14:04] amen I'd love to do that sometimes are
[1:14:11] we together I'm going to teach you a
[1:14:15] little bit you just listening to me
[1:14:19] closely now because this could surprise
[1:14:24] you a little bit like it did to me
[1:14:28] listening the little baby Abraham
[1:14:30] speaking here in the message Revelation
[1:14:32] chapter 4 he says now immediately after
[1:14:40] he showed the end of the age of his work
[1:14:46] year he went up to heaven he said I will
[1:14:49] show you what's going to be after this
[1:14:53] after the church ages he said John I
[1:14:56] can't talk to you down here no more cos
[1:15:00] I have left down here come up higher
[1:15:04] come up with me amen and I will show you
[1:15:08] what's going to take place year after o
[1:15:12] mine cut up in a vision cut up in glory
[1:15:18] are we together amen and he talks about
[1:15:22] the experience and then and and talks
[1:15:25] about he says and what Paul saw he he
[1:15:30] was forbidding to speak about it or to
[1:15:33] put it out to the public all mine I
[1:15:36] don't I don't believe he could do it a
[1:15:40] little trip I talked he's talking about
[1:15:42] his experience beyond the curtain of
[1:15:44] time
[1:15:45] I have never got over in Ewa where he
[1:15:48] saw things that he couldn't talk about
[1:15:52] amen he was caught up in the tear
[1:15:55] heavens see up in the tear heavens now
[1:15:58] listening to this now that's well I want
[1:16:01] I want to grab you in their bed he says
[1:16:03] what difference how difference when Joel
[1:16:07] was caught up in seeing Jesus listening
[1:16:11] carefully he said write it in the book
[1:16:17] what you have seen and give it back send
[1:16:21] it back to the churches John Paul was
[1:16:29] forbidding to speak and John was even
[1:16:34] acts to put it in a book so it would go
[1:16:39] to all down through the ages praise the
[1:16:44] Lord
[1:16:44] oh my it is revealed now so to be
[1:16:54] revealed in the last day it wasn't
[1:16:56] revealed in his days it was revealed in
[1:16:58] the last day
[1:17:00] praise the Lord amen
[1:17:11] okay I went ahead of myself a little bit
[1:17:13] so this is why I want to get you he says
[1:17:15] John I left the earth now Christ I left
[1:17:21] the earth in the form of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:24] and I returned back to the body again he
[1:17:30] said today the body sit there as a
[1:17:35] memorial as a sacrifice praise Lord he's
[1:17:42] talking about Jesus now when he ascended
[1:17:45] up to glory his body sit on the throne
[1:17:52] Revelation chapter 4:1 is upon the truth
[1:17:55] that's why the scripture says so his
[1:17:57] body sit on the throne as a memorial
[1:18:02] just like his body was lying in the
[1:18:06] grave as a memorial but his spirit was
[1:18:09] down in hell preaching to the source
[1:18:11] impressive now his body sits on the
[1:18:15] throne as a memorial are we together we
[1:18:22] get we get to go back we get to go right
[1:18:26] on down through the chapter but the
[1:18:29] Spirit of Christ come back to live in
[1:18:33] the church to live in us praise the Lord
[1:18:40] so where is his body on earth because
[1:18:48] the one on the truth is just there as a
[1:18:50] memorial who get into death
[1:18:54] there are a lot of few things I will
[1:18:55] show you as we go in steady in there
[1:18:57] because better Adam said is just like
[1:19:00] when when Ezra was about to leave Egypt
[1:19:02] they kept Joseph's body as a memorial
[1:19:07] praise the Lord
[1:19:09] amen his body was as a memorial to prove
[1:19:14] to them that there was a levy on the
[1:19:16] river there was a lane one day they are
[1:19:20] going to do it
[1:19:21] intro so brother Branham is showing us
[1:19:24] is a very same thing with Christ there
[1:19:27] is a reason why his emphasis his work
[1:19:30] that he's doing what was revealed to
[1:19:32] John on the island of Patmos was
[1:19:35] concerning what he was going to do in
[1:19:37] the church that is the reason why he
[1:19:40] says if a man speak against this body
[1:19:42] where I will forgive you because I will
[1:19:44] keep it as a memorial but when I come
[1:19:46] back in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:48] one word spoke against me will not be
[1:19:51] forgiving he said poor why persecute
[1:19:53] down me when poor never met him in the
[1:19:57] flesh when poor never met him in the
[1:20:07] flesh
[1:20:11] Berta Branham says the church can be at
[1:20:14] its weaker level he says but yet the
[1:20:18] church is much better than what this
[1:20:21] word will offer you this is a mystical
[1:20:25] body people comes they sit down and
[1:20:28] pretty soon they look over their
[1:20:30] shoulder they put a church on the scale
[1:20:32] and anything there well okay yeah you
[1:20:35] know these people they are not deep they
[1:20:36] are not high I may be right in the
[1:20:38] middle okay the church is a mystical
[1:20:44] body you can you can never master what
[1:20:46] is happening in the church with your
[1:20:47] human mind the God of heaven and earth
[1:20:56] wanted to show the word his glory even
[1:20:59] right there in Babylon wanted to bring
[1:21:02] the entire Bible and a kid up to know
[1:21:04] that there is only one God is he a
[1:21:09] typical thing for him to come from the
[1:21:11] heavens and just said Nebuchadnezzar and
[1:21:13] all your men Shadrach Meshach and
[1:21:17] Abednego they are my they're my people I
[1:21:19] am the only true God he had to allow
[1:21:22] those faithful believers to go into a
[1:21:25] burning fire then he comes down in the
[1:21:29] fire then the king said I see war like
[1:21:33] the son of the son of God
[1:21:41] the way God works and the way he deal
[1:21:44] with his church and the way he deals
[1:21:46] with his people the thing he allows our
[1:21:49] life to go through that's the reason why
[1:21:51] when you guys point I mean when we
[1:21:54] become a stiff headed and struggle and
[1:21:58] trying to stick in our weight you give
[1:22:00] God too much probably and you make the
[1:22:04] work hard for yourself because God we
[1:22:08] have to wait down for you to get out of
[1:22:10] your anger wait wait for you to cool
[1:22:13] down
[1:22:14] be yourself be normal son just be normal
[1:22:17] he will allow things to start happening
[1:22:20] around you that would make you laugh and
[1:22:22] smile again then he becomes in a start
[1:22:24] dealing with you praise the Lord because
[1:22:32] if he should meet you in his anger with
[1:22:34] your anger you were not so bad his anger
[1:22:41] are we together now so what are we
[1:22:45] saying tonight let me get back to what I
[1:22:50] was reading so we can we can close here
[1:22:53] this the time is right here pronto so
[1:22:55] butter bread I'm trying to make emphasis
[1:22:57] on this Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit a
[1:23:00] hymn of flesh that reflect Jesus Christ
[1:23:02] the Son of God he said that's what
[1:23:03] people reject a new breath oh they have
[1:23:07] got what they call the new bird I went
[1:23:10] up and I shocked the pastor him you know
[1:23:13] and and that's the new birth the reason
[1:23:17] they won't accept it in a week some
[1:23:20] people create this this mentor thing in
[1:23:23] your mind and think is the new bird you
[1:23:25] know because I've been in the church or
[1:23:27] because I did this and because you know
[1:23:29] what you know and this thing happened
[1:23:33] now he goes ahead he says and that's why
[1:23:37] that's why they were John Church because
[1:23:40] they can come in some intellectual way
[1:23:44] God said except a man be born again he
[1:23:48] cannot even
[1:23:50] see the kingdom of heaven no matter how
[1:23:53] intellectual you may be or how good a
[1:23:57] Christian you claim to be you've got to
[1:24:00] be born again you say brother branham I
[1:24:04] have to come to some little mission that
[1:24:10] doesn't mean it amen it means you have
[1:24:12] got to receive the new birth you have
[1:24:15] got to be born again and this system
[1:24:18] makes all the end he goes into talking
[1:24:20] about birth he says wherever is born
[1:24:22] it's a mess
[1:24:24] praise the Lord and let me bring it this
[1:24:27] way as you read then you know burn burn
[1:24:29] we're talking about uses wherever they
[1:24:31] say what is born in in a hospital or
[1:24:35] whatever birth is it's a mess
[1:24:37] but you know one thing that is also true
[1:24:41] of wherever the birth is there is also a
[1:24:45] crowd that is going on praise the Lord
[1:24:48] that is the evidence of your new birth
[1:24:52] when God can start dealing with your
[1:24:54] heart like bird arawa who say God start
[1:24:57] squeezing your heart to bring tears out
[1:24:59] of your eyes and God can start dealing
[1:25:03] with your heart while you sit down think
[1:25:06] about his goodness and think about his
[1:25:09] grace upon you
[1:25:10] and they will bring tears to your eyes
[1:25:13] and make you to start sobbing and crying
[1:25:16] it shows that birth has come praise the
[1:25:21] Lord
[1:25:21] whether it's an animal or a human when
[1:25:25] that birth comes the next thing that
[1:25:27] comes it's a crime if there is no crisis
[1:25:29] to birth and that's why the church is
[1:25:32] started because that is the thing that
[1:25:36] have gone away from the church people
[1:25:39] have taken their own personalities and
[1:25:42] the deal with things the way they want
[1:25:44] to deal with fate that's my way of
[1:25:45] dealing with it there is one way your
[1:25:48] Christ the truth the way and the life
[1:25:52] amen but that is the evidence of birth
[1:25:57] the next thing that comes after it is
[1:26:00] crying and that's what happened when God
[1:26:04] dealing with the human heart praise the
[1:26:09] Lord
[1:26:13] so if you stay struggle to sit before
[1:26:17] the Lord and weep
[1:26:19] you must be crying for the new birth
[1:26:21] that's the thing you should be asking
[1:26:24] God for because when that birth comes
[1:26:29] someone talking about the goodness of
[1:26:31] God would bring tears in your eyes
[1:26:33] amen seeing how God is merciful to
[1:26:41] somebody would bring tears out of your
[1:26:43] eyes it shows that God has started
[1:26:46] dealing with your heart praise the Lord
[1:26:52] see some of the young people they said I
[1:26:55] remember one time one time and the only
[1:26:58] time I was down there over India in in
[1:27:02] Kenya address I was preaching and after
[1:27:05] after the service there was one young
[1:27:07] girl still remember her she came to the
[1:27:12] altar and she cried she cried the child
[1:27:15] cried I was just sitting there after I
[1:27:17] prayed for all the people I was
[1:27:19] wandering in my mind I wonder what is
[1:27:23] she dealing with so I went back in the
[1:27:26] office and then after a stroll outside I
[1:27:31] tried to keep my eyes on the crowd and
[1:27:33] have a good crowd there
[1:27:34] I was trying to look for her so right
[1:27:36] after the service she went out and then
[1:27:39] she I mean she just quite down you know
[1:27:41] somewhere there behind the church so as
[1:27:44] I walk around I saw her then I call her
[1:27:45] access I said how are you she's a fine
[1:27:49] so what were you crying about she said
[1:27:55] it to me so beautiful she said she's a
[1:28:00] sinner baby Church I have never gone to
[1:28:02] the altar she said and I don't know what
[1:28:06] picked me up from my seat it took me to
[1:28:10] the altar she was not crying because she
[1:28:13] did something wrong she was
[1:28:15] just crying because she got a bird she
[1:28:20] got a bird when you receive a bird
[1:28:23] that's what will happen to you you can
[1:28:30] practice all the rules of the church and
[1:28:34] you can stay have a dry face before the
[1:28:37] commandment of God when you receive a
[1:28:41] breath the next thing they're happy and
[1:28:48] I talk to her a little bit she said that
[1:28:52] just all and she said I'm just feeling
[1:28:54] so different and we should just shave
[1:28:56] her in like that there she's standing
[1:28:58] before me she so I was trying to get a
[1:29:00] hold a little bit I'm just trying to
[1:29:03] help her and it just blessed my heart
[1:29:06] she said I don't know what picked me up
[1:29:09] that's my first time they ever happy to
[1:29:12] me and I mean she was sobbing she was
[1:29:14] sobbing she was just crying ah ha ha ha
[1:29:18] ha tinh eyes out praise the Lord
[1:29:23] next time you see a pressing crying in
[1:29:26] church don't think about sin they have
[1:29:28] just been visited by the Holy Ghost
[1:29:31] those poor teachings that imprison
[1:29:35] people mind
[1:29:36] they have taken tears from the church
[1:29:39] people sit on the Essene and it becomes
[1:29:43] so strong face on their sing well when
[1:29:46] you receive the birth when the Holy
[1:29:48] Ghost start dealing with your heart it
[1:29:50] will not be so hard for you to cry what
[1:29:53] our improvi whether in public it will
[1:29:56] not be so hard for you to cry
[1:30:10] we need to give God change to deal with
[1:30:12] our hearts because the promise of this
[1:30:15] message is to turn the heart back
[1:30:17] this is a message that these with the
[1:30:19] heart God want pictures that preach from
[1:30:22] their heart and people that receive to
[1:30:25] their heart
[1:30:36] praise the Lord he says whatever it is
[1:30:40] whatever the birth is it's a mess in a
[1:30:42] way but it produced life in produced
[1:30:47] life what kind of a life seven life to
[1:30:50] humble yourself and to deny yourself
[1:30:52] that's the kind of a life all they say
[1:30:55] but I see them crying and bowling around
[1:30:59] on the altar and carrying on sure they
[1:31:03] are being born it's a mess I don't care
[1:31:06] where you go it might it might get up to

[1:31:14] of tears and your eyes red and your
[1:31:16] hands rod and the beating beating on the
[1:31:19] altar but it's a birth it men praise the
[1:31:24] Lord

[1:31:27] try when it's born is stretching this
