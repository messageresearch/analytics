[52:42] uh I I actually announced earlier that
[52:45] we will have had a communion service
[52:48] because I was concerned about the
[52:50] weather since uh the 31st was falling on
[52:53] Sunday I thought it we have bad weather
[52:56] we were just going to have a late
[52:58] service into the afternoon and just stay
[53:01] for communion and go home that was that
[53:04] was my thought so we kept watching the
[53:07] weather and then I spoke to brother
[53:10] brother Ben from uh from South Africa
[53:14] and just asking what the weather would
[53:15] be he says what I think it would be a
[53:17] good weather and uh so I said well okay
[53:20] then we will change the order of the
[53:21] service just so I can be able to buy
[53:24] time to rest between the services before
[53:26] we get back this evening uh uh I would
[53:30] hate for you to be having service and
[53:32] I'm home sleeping so uh that's the
[53:35] reason why we Chang the order of the
[53:36] service we'll come back this evening
[53:38] just for the prayer meeting and uh uh
[53:42] and then uh pray our up to the midnight
[53:45] as soon that we enter 2024 we will pray

[56:20] individual I just been so mad with the

[56:29] devil but we just want to thank the Lord
[56:32] amen we want to be so grateful to each
[56:35] and every one of you and uh uh once
[56:37] again uh uh brother Emmanuel and and
[56:40] sister Vera there's uh brother arod and
[56:43] his siblings parents spending this time
[56:46] with us we appreciate that and uh you
[56:51] know this year uh how can we sum the
[56:54] entire year up uh
[56:57] uh
[56:59] uh you know as a pastor as you come to
[57:02] the end of the year those are some of
[57:04] the things that you think about you if
[57:06] you realize at the end of this year we
[57:08] had a lot of visiting preachers
[57:10] preaching for us is because I was
[57:12] spending time doing something different
[57:15] not something contrary to the world but
[57:17] something different something that I've
[57:20] uh uh uh you know uh I always do at the
[57:23] end of the year uh where you try to sit
[57:25] back and you look and take an eventory
[57:28] of the entire year put some things
[57:31] before God and and uh uh you know just
[57:34] spend some time in praying and fasting
[57:37] so it was good that God was able to send
[57:39] us some preachers to be able to help us
[57:42] and then we were just preaching in
[57:44] between services but uh I mean this year
[57:48] was uh uh I would say it was a good year
[57:53] amen uh I'm I'm saying it was a good
[57:56] year because uh uh every day Genesis
[57:59] chapter 1 that God made he said it was
[58:01] good yes amen every day he he made he
[58:06] said it was good and we are taught in
[58:08] the in the word that everything work for
[58:11] good to them that love the Lord praise
[58:14] the Lord so uh uh uh we we might have
[58:20] lost some battles but we never lost the
[58:22] war amen we never lost lost the world
[58:26] because we are we are not fighting for
[58:29] victory we are fighting from
[58:32] Victory praise the Lord because Jesus
[58:35] have already fought our battle so we are
[58:38] fighting from Victory not for victory
[58:41] praise the Lord amen and because he have
[58:45] counted us more than
[58:48] conquerors okay and uh uh so that's uh
[58:53] that's that's what it is we uh
[58:55] we are fighting from Victory and uh we
[58:58] have uh we had uh uh our own share of
[59:02] challenges you know uh uh we have some
[59:06] of our young people uh struggling you
[59:08] know we begin with them in church and
[59:11] they started going through one thing or
[59:12] another you know all of those things we
[59:14] see them you know we see them and they
[59:17] break our hearts we pray you know we
[59:19] just keep ourself before God say oh God
[59:21] be merciful help these people but you
[59:23] see other thing about it also is that uh
[59:27] they need their own experience am amen
[59:30] they need their own experience they will
[59:33] never uh get a hold of this reality on
[59:36] their parents experience amen praise the
[59:39] Lord amen we know some of them might be
[59:42] greatly wounded some of them might uh
[59:44] you know well be de but they need their
[59:46] own experience and and all you can do is
[59:49] to just pray for them and commit them in
[59:51] the hands of the Lord one thing we don't
[59:54] want to do is to be judgment amen amen
[59:58] praise the Lord amen one thing we don't
[1:00:00] want to do is to be judgment I I love
[1:00:03] that we were down I brother prayed a
[1:00:05] meeting you know he uh as he opens the
[1:00:08] meeting he says something and it that
[1:00:11] stuck with me you know you are welcome
[1:00:13] here to you know to praise the Lord to
[1:00:15] dance worship but one thing we don't
[1:00:17] want you to do is to
[1:00:19] judge amen we don't want you to judge
[1:00:23] anybody amen if it is not done the way
[1:00:26] you think it should be done pray for
[1:00:30] us praise the Lord pray for
[1:00:34] us so I mean in in in in all of that uh
[1:00:39] uh
[1:00:41] uh did we had a wedding this year oh
[1:00:44] yeah jimama jimama got married so yeah
[1:00:46] we have we had a wedding this year and
[1:00:48] and I mean and just just the different
[1:00:50] things you know and uh y we are just on
[1:00:56] um the the border of uh
[1:00:59] 2024 and it breaks in tomorrow morning
[1:01:03] uh we don't we don't uh uh know actually
[1:01:07] what is going to bring and uh we we hope
[1:01:10] and pray that it brings us the coming of
[1:01:12] the Lord amen because that's the only
[1:01:15] future we have our only future we have
[1:01:19] is the rapture the Rapture is our
[1:01:22] future and whatever ever we will do in
[1:01:25] this life let's do it because of the
[1:01:27] Rapture if you will get married get
[1:01:30] married because you want to go in the
[1:01:32] Rapture if you get your degree get your
[1:01:34] degree because you want to go in the
[1:01:36] Rapture the Rapture is the only future
[1:01:39] that we have we are living in the
[1:01:41] feeling word and uh and it's it's keep
[1:01:45] getting it's keep getting worse it keep
[1:01:48] getting B all the time so uh these are
[1:01:52] just some of the few things that uh we
[1:01:56] uh we wanted to to bring to you and uh
[1:02:00] as we once again thank each and every
[1:02:03] one of you and uh like I said we we went
[1:02:06] through different things uh like uh
[1:02:10] family goes through like every Church
[1:02:13] goes
[1:02:14] through and then uh this year they also
[1:02:18] we had uh uh field you know uh and uh it
[1:02:22] is it is not a strip
[1:02:25] language to say we lost few people in
[1:02:28] church amen we only lost them when it go
[1:02:31] back to the word you know we only lost
[1:02:33] them when they they decide that they
[1:02:35] don't believe the message anymore and
[1:02:38] they don't want to serve God anymore but
[1:02:40] those that have gone to be on with the
[1:02:42] Lord we didn't have lost him we can
[1:02:45] probably say that we put few behind the
[1:02:48] curtain of time amen they have gone to
[1:02:51] wait for us amen praise the Lord
[1:02:55] so uh uh uh uh I will I our dear brother
[1:02:59] brother uh Steve J B and uh uh uh uh we
[1:03:06] got to know uh
[1:03:09] um sister now me sister-in-law FR for
[1:03:13] the for the a little bit of time that
[1:03:15] she spent here you know and and and few
[1:03:18] of those
[1:03:19] ones and uh and just before we came to
[1:03:22] the to the close of of uh of the of the
[1:03:27] year we we had to experience some of our
[1:03:30] toughest uh uh uh experience you know
[1:03:33] toughest battle and uh
[1:03:37] uh and you know it was it was it was
[1:03:40] something that uh just just kind of forp
[1:03:44] us that that was one of the thing that
[1:03:45] robbed me of all of my strength to be
[1:03:47] able to do do anything around here and
[1:03:51] uh uh the only reason why
[1:03:55] uh you know I I was able to travel it
[1:03:58] was because of of the need that brother
[1:04:01] you know brother v share with me and uh
[1:04:04] when he told me that uh Hey brother want
[1:04:06] these people lost their Pastor they need
[1:04:09] some help I've been working with them
[1:04:12] and uh I would want you to to please
[1:04:14] come I couldn't think about anybody that
[1:04:17] that would be a blessing to them than to
[1:04:19] have you come I was humbled by that and
[1:04:22] then I had to go but uh
[1:04:24] with things that we were we were kind of
[1:04:27] working with or dealing with uh uh was
[1:04:30] really dear and heav to our heart that
[1:04:33] uh we we couldn't find the strength you
[1:04:35] know most of the time many times the way
[1:04:39] that I would know that I need to travel
[1:04:42] is that the Lord will give me the
[1:04:43] message to
[1:04:45] preach but it was difficult this time
[1:04:48] because my mind was just all over the
[1:04:50] place I mean there were just a lot of
[1:04:52] things that was support my mind it was
[1:04:54] really really difficult so every service
[1:04:58] the people produce their own message I
[1:05:01] told the Lord I'm just cing I will get
[1:05:03] to the pulpit and then you'll be able to
[1:05:05] help me there were a few things that was
[1:05:07] on my heart though I didn't went with an
[1:05:09] empty mind I have few things on my heart
[1:05:12] but I watched the service from one
[1:05:13] service to another every service every
[1:05:16] message that I plan to preach was
[1:05:18] change every service I told the people I
[1:05:21] say you are the one driving the services
[1:05:23] you know every message that I plan to
[1:05:26] preach was changed in the midst of the
[1:05:28] service and I mean I was preaching not
[1:05:31] less than 2 hours every Services the
[1:05:34] last service I preached almost more than
[1:05:37] 3 hours because they didn't want it to
[1:05:39] stop you know I told them I'm I'm tired
[1:05:41] can I stop they say no I told them I
[1:05:44] said well I have a wife and two
[1:05:46] daughters waiting for me I'm not
[1:05:48] planning I'm not planning to drop dead
[1:05:50] here this morning so this afternoon so
[1:05:54] we have to we will have to uh you know
[1:05:57] uh uh cut the service off you know I had
[1:06:00] to beg them to stop I mean those uh
[1:06:03] those sou African people they would take
[1:06:05] the life out of you
[1:06:08] amen you know they had bimo pool right
[1:06:11] at at the back of the pull pit and uh uh
[1:06:15] uh and uh uh and it it was it was really
[1:06:19] hard you know so I told the brothers I
[1:06:22] say if I drop you just take me and throw
[1:06:25] me in that pool if I don't wake up then
[1:06:28] you know that I'm
[1:06:30] gone praise the Lord but you know uh uh
[1:06:34] just just like we we are saying uh you
[1:06:37] know and and and different different
[1:06:38] other things but uh in the midst of all
[1:06:41] of
[1:06:43] that uh uh with with uh the feel that
[1:06:47] the Lord allowed us you know to to uh um
[1:06:55] put on the other side of uh of of glory
[1:06:59] and uh uh there is there's a little one
[1:07:04] and uh
[1:07:06] uh uh brother brother Ariel and his wife
[1:07:11] they were uh expecting the little
[1:07:14] girl and uh uh just in the midst of that
[1:07:19] uh the the child started to have
[1:07:22] crisis and uh the actors were very
[1:07:24] concerned about it and uh uh and that
[1:07:29] that actually put us into into uh
[1:07:33] praying spending time with them and uh
[1:07:37] and and asking for the word of the Lord
[1:07:40] and it pleased the Lord to take the
[1:07:42] little baby
[1:07:44] home and uh uh wish of course that that
[1:07:49] was that was actually heartbreaking I
[1:07:52] know I spoke to them from South Africa
[1:07:56] when uh when when that happened and
[1:07:59] spent some time praying with them on the
[1:08:02] phone and uh
[1:08:07] uh just imagine with the time difference
[1:08:11] you know uh uh right now I think they
[1:08:15] have finished with their evening service
[1:08:17] before we even start in our service now
[1:08:20] with the time year so uh uh
[1:08:25] uh uh I mean that kept me up all through
[1:08:28] the night and I had to get myself ready
[1:08:31] to preach the next morning you know with
[1:08:33] with all of that but uh uh uh we want to
[1:08:37] thank the Lord for his faithfulness
[1:08:40] because uh just like the word say you
[1:08:44] know uh uh we know that uh uh uh the
[1:08:50] thoughts of the Lord uh are good towards
[1:08:53] his people people and uh and the Lord
[1:08:56] have a have a reason why he he allowed
[1:09:00] that there is something that I've I've
[1:09:02] learned in my few years of following the
[1:09:06] Lord everybody are not made for the same
[1:09:11] trials there are certain people that are
[1:09:15] gifted for the same
[1:09:18] trials I was in South Africa just again
[1:09:21] a good friend of mine and this brother
[1:09:23] brother many years ago uh uh uh when I
[1:09:28] came to the message he said as my pastor
[1:09:32] then after a few years I also serve as
[1:09:34] his Pastor he called me his pastor and
[1:09:38] uh uh uh I was in South Africa having
[1:09:42] some
[1:09:44] meetings and he called me on the phone
[1:09:47] he says I need to talk to
[1:09:49] you and uh
[1:09:52] uh uh I I called him and he told me you
[1:09:57] know well he just got
[1:10:00] married and uh and his wife was
[1:10:03] respecting he lost his
[1:10:06] wife with the
[1:10:09] baby and I was sitting there talking to
[1:10:11] him and the Lord just placed upon me and
[1:10:15] I told him I I said brother God favor
[1:10:19] you it's hard to see how that's that is
[1:10:22] a favor from the Lord
[1:10:24] but I say God favor you to give you the
[1:10:28] same experience of his
[1:10:34] Prophet I don't know how that is going
[1:10:36] to be a favor from the
[1:10:40] Lord but for God to choose
[1:10:43] you to experience lossing your wife and
[1:10:48] your
[1:10:49] baby I think that's a favor from the
[1:10:51] lord I can't explain it but that's that
[1:10:54] was mine consolation to
[1:10:57] him maybe with time the Lord my help you
[1:11:02] to understand
[1:11:04] that and and that is the way uh that's
[1:11:09] what I believe and as I see these things
[1:11:12] in our
[1:11:15] life and with that being said many of
[1:11:19] the time when we deal with tough things
[1:11:22] in our life
[1:11:28] the attitude that we take after those
[1:11:32] things help us to either enounter the
[1:11:37] blessings there those trials
[1:11:41] brings or it just put us in the wrong
[1:11:45] path because sometimes when people go
[1:11:48] through tough things in their life they
[1:11:51] actually don't take the right attitude
[1:11:54] you know sometimes we become so
[1:11:58] entitled that we think why it has to
[1:12:01] happen to
[1:12:03] me why not
[1:12:07] you you know and uh
[1:12:13] uh we have to realize
[1:12:16] that if God want to prove
[1:12:21] anything in this
[1:12:24] generation whether if God want to prove
[1:12:27] that he's still heal
[1:12:31] cancer there is no way that he can prove
[1:12:33] it unless he borrow my body or your
[1:12:41] body praise the
[1:12:43] Lord if God will prove that he stay
[1:12:46] faithful there is no way that he can be
[1:12:49] able to do it except he put
[1:12:52] me into a tight
[1:13:01] spot praise the
[1:13:04] Lord and if there is anything that uh I
[1:13:08] can encourage us to
[1:13:10] do is to dedicate ourself to the Lord
[1:13:14] that he can use our body for whatever he
[1:13:18] want to
[1:13:19] do praise the Lord because unless you
[1:13:23] understand it that way if you start to
[1:13:26] deal with things in your life it's going
[1:13:28] to be
[1:13:31] difficult it's going to be
[1:13:34] difficult so with that being said let's
[1:13:37] just stand on on our
[1:13:39] feet and uh we will have a a little time
[1:13:44] of
[1:13:46] Silence
[1:13:48] because you see uh we being taught by
[1:13:53] the word and taught by the prophet that
[1:13:56] we
[1:13:57] believe that this message is the word of
[1:14:00] God for this
[1:14:02] age no matter what people said and what
[1:14:04] they
[1:14:07] think I'm fully
[1:14:11] convinced I was uh preaching on
[1:14:14] Wednesday night on the continuation of
[1:14:17] the revelation of Jesus
[1:14:19] Christ and I told the church we are
[1:14:22] under a vision
[1:14:24] this message is God's vision for this
[1:14:28] age and we are under that Vision until
[1:14:32] the vision impacts you you will never
[1:14:36] know the life and the reality of this
[1:14:40] message you will take it like any other
[1:14:42] Church take it like any other group
[1:14:46] unless you have been impacted by the
[1:14:49] vision when Daniel was impacted by his
[1:14:52] vision he lied there many days he was
[1:14:55] weak he never had no strength in his
[1:14:57] body join experienced the same thing on
[1:15:00] the island of
[1:15:01] pmos we are under a
[1:15:04] vision everything that is fulfilling in
[1:15:06] our ede is not only the seven vision of
[1:15:09] brother Brandon but everything that is
[1:15:11] happening in our age in our
[1:15:14] time is a vision that God gave to his
[1:15:20] Heaven praise the Lord somehow has
[1:15:23] caught the
[1:15:24] vision and uh uh uh some are stay
[1:15:29] struggling with the
[1:15:32] vision some have not understood that
[1:15:34] it's a
[1:15:37] vision praise the Lord so uh uh uh those
[1:15:42] things uh uh uh you know whenever we we
[1:15:46] have those things and and in a way that
[1:15:48] we are taught Life
[1:15:51] Begins from the very very seed of
[1:15:56] conception praise the lord it's not when
[1:15:59] the fullness of the child is here that's
[1:16:02] when life
[1:16:03] begins Life Begins from the very seed of
[1:16:07] conception and uh uh uh when that life
[1:16:12] is conceived in the
[1:16:15] womm and uh and the mother comes to
[1:16:20] church the parents comes to church

[1:16:29] womb every time the mom was in church
[1:16:33] that baby was present in

[1:39:37] um I don't love to do this but uh for
[1:39:40] some reason um I'm uh I'm feeling a
[1:39:44] little B compared to do the to do
[1:39:48] it and uh because we we we trying to
[1:39:51] close the year amen we got to check the
[1:39:54] box and make sure that the box is adding
[1:39:57] up praise the Lord amen uh
[1:40:02] uh uh we have a young lady young sister
[1:40:08] that
[1:40:09] uh uh she been coming here for the while
[1:40:14] and
[1:40:16] uh
[1:40:19] uh
[1:40:26] I think it was uh the
[1:40:29] the the morning that Pastor
[1:40:32] Mars uh friend brother
[1:40:35] Miron uh uh there preach for us and
[1:40:39] Pastor Martin is from Nigeria if you
[1:40:41] remember that and uh
[1:40:46] uh you know because I've I've used this
[1:40:49] uh while being way because it have been
[1:40:52] a blessing to me you know it have been a
[1:40:54] blessing to me uh and and you know it is
[1:40:58] it is it is just it is just to the
[1:41:01] praise and to the glory of the Lord you
[1:41:03] know you see those things you see God uh
[1:41:06] uh either doing something in the life of
[1:41:09] someone or God using using them to do
[1:41:12] something and and I mean it's just all
[1:41:14] to praise the Lord is never because of
[1:41:16] the person uh as uh you know as an
[1:41:20] individual
[1:41:22] and uh uh uh and that's
[1:41:27] uh
[1:41:32] uh I would think it was almost 5 years
[1:41:37] ago if I'm right that but that was
[1:41:39] before the co five years
[1:41:43] ago and I I had such a burden on my
[1:41:46] heart and uh
[1:41:49] uh uh no ignoring the community you know
[1:41:52] where we find ourself and some of the
[1:41:54] things that happen around you you know
[1:41:57] if you don't if you don't get around
[1:41:59] here you you you really you really don't
[1:42:01] know how blessed we are to come to
[1:42:03] church here and uh
[1:42:11] uh and then uh uh with that burden on my
[1:42:15] heart uh you know uh uh just praying
[1:42:18] about certain things and asking the Lord
[1:42:20] to help and then I got I got introduced
[1:42:23] to a Christian material and that
[1:42:26] Christian
[1:42:27] material uh it was it was all about you
[1:42:30] know working with people that are
[1:42:32] dealing with different challenges I
[1:42:33] won't take much much of the time to do
[1:42:35] that but uh uh you know you prayed about
[1:42:39] that and you asked the Lord you know
[1:42:42] what what you know what's you know what
[1:42:45] is all of this you know you know and uh
[1:42:47] Lead Me Guide Me you know and and then
[1:42:50] sometimes it looks like like it just fed
[1:42:51] away but uh that morning after uh Pastor
[1:42:55] mad preached and even before that
[1:42:59] morning uh uh that young lady sitting
[1:43:03] back there uh she uh uh she was in the
[1:43:08] service before then so I went home and I
[1:43:10] told my wife I said I said there's a
[1:43:13] young uh girl that have come over to the
[1:43:16] church Field Time and this morning when
[1:43:19] I was preaching it looks like she just
[1:43:21] got so so uh caught up in what I was I
[1:43:24] was talking about I like to talk to her
[1:43:27] that sometime if she comes back again
[1:43:30] and then the next service will be the
[1:43:31] service where Pastor Martin was
[1:43:33] preaching and then after after the
[1:43:35] service he wanted to see me and uh uh
[1:43:38] then she came over to the office uh to
[1:43:41] talk to
[1:43:42] me this young lady uh I mean she was the
[1:43:46] Lord was dealing with her I believe sure
[1:43:48] that it was the Lord dealing with her
[1:43:49] heart and uh you know and then she was
[1:43:52] just she was just pouring out her heart
[1:43:54] to the Lord and you know and and and you
[1:43:57] know uh uh asking the Lord to help her
[1:44:00] and you know she was just uh uh pouring
[1:44:03] her heart to the Lord and uh
[1:44:07] uh you know and then she could she could
[1:44:09] hard even say what she wanted to say
[1:44:12] then you know give her the time to to be
[1:44:15] able to just uh weep before the Lord it
[1:44:17] was almost like seeing the experience of
[1:44:21] uh uh you know the woman going to Simon
[1:44:24] house and using her tears to wash the
[1:44:26] feet of Jesus you know and I mean she
[1:44:28] was just crying out her
[1:44:30] heart and then she will she would tell
[1:44:33] me of how you know uh uh uh she felt
[1:44:37] that the Lord was dealing with her heart
[1:44:39] and she needed to you know give us give
[1:44:42] her heart to the Lord and uh uh you know
[1:44:46] she's she's uh you know from a Christian
[1:44:48] home and went away uh uh uh from the
[1:44:51] Lord for the while but uh she wanted to
[1:44:53] you know uh just uh uh give her heart to
[1:44:56] the Lord and ask the Lord to help her
[1:44:59] and as sometimes you will think uh you
[1:45:01] think about all of this and
[1:45:04] uh uh so while in talking I wanted to
[1:45:07] know you know uh uh I thought it was
[1:45:10] someone that invited her because I
[1:45:12] remember I think it was one evening uh
[1:45:16] the first the first time that maybe she
[1:45:18] stumbled into church and uh
[1:45:22] uh uh you know so I asked her and and
[1:45:27] and she she told me that how she was you
[1:45:30] know uh uh uh you know when she had this
[1:45:34] urge on her heart and the Lord dealing
[1:45:36] with her heart she pulled on her phone
[1:45:38] and and the first address that will come
[1:45:41] to her phone for the church will be this
[1:45:44] place and it's not like someone that is
[1:45:46] driving from across the road or someone
[1:45:49] that is coming from the n Street back
[1:45:51] here uh she drove for uh it it will be
[1:45:54] pretty much maybe over 10 minutes 12 15
[1:45:57] minutes down here and I'm sitting there
[1:46:00] and in my mind I'm thinking well there
[1:46:02] are many churches along the road you
[1:46:04] know uh uh you know why you will go
[1:46:06] through the highway and come uh through
[1:46:08] the rail light and turn the in and just
[1:46:10] come right into this building it have to
[1:46:13] be the
[1:46:14] Lord and the reason why I'm saying there
[1:46:17] like I said is to praise the Lord but
[1:46:20] I'm saying there
[1:46:21] because it brought me to a personal
[1:46:25] conviction it brought me to a conviction
[1:46:28] and I think if if if uh if you just try
[1:46:30] to remind yourself you remember one
[1:46:32] Wednesday night I was speaking on
[1:46:33] something it brought me to that
[1:46:36] conviction and uh uh uh they on tell as
[1:46:40] a mortar as Hons as young people and
[1:46:45] even other people
[1:46:47] until we feel the need
[1:46:51] of the savior in our
[1:46:54] life this gospel will not be real to
[1:46:58] you it will just become another church
[1:47:03] until you feel the need of God that you
[1:47:07] need God in your
[1:47:10] life this will not be real to
[1:47:14] you praise the
[1:47:16] Lord all of this language I was born in
[1:47:19] the message
[1:47:23] you know I was in church I grew up in
[1:47:27] church that don't give you the need of
[1:47:29] the
[1:47:31] Savior it just make you
[1:47:37] religious you will
[1:47:40] never you will
[1:47:43] never come to the experience of the new
[1:47:47] birth until down in your heart not
[1:47:52] someone telling you to be born again or
[1:47:55] someone telling you you need to be
[1:47:57] baptized but until you starts to feel it
[1:48:01] it La a it like a painful
[1:48:05] desire not a hurting
[1:48:09] desire it's almost like a desire that
[1:48:11] you need a thirst you need you need a
[1:48:13] drink water or else you will drop and
[1:48:16] die until you start to feel the need of
[1:48:21] God in your
[1:48:23] life the gospel will never be real to
[1:48:29] you I sat there I was I was looking at
[1:48:33] this young
[1:48:35] lady I sat
[1:48:38] there and I fold my hands give her all
[1:48:42] the time to express herself you know
[1:48:46] pour out her heart and before she even
[1:48:48] started talking to me
[1:48:54] that it has to be
[1:48:57] God it have to be God because none of us
[1:49:00] in this building witnessed to her no one
[1:49:02] invited her to
[1:49:05] church the need of God in her
[1:49:10] life make her to get out of her house
[1:49:13] get in her vehicle go down the street
[1:49:15] cross the rail line drive all through
[1:49:17] the distance to be able to come here
[1:49:27] praise the
[1:49:33] Lord and that has given me that personal
[1:49:38] conviction that until we feel the need
[1:49:42] of God in our life this will all be up
[1:49:46] here in our
[1:49:47] head we will think we know
[1:49:51] it because we have we have heard
[1:50:00] it and oh how I pray that God visit our
[1:50:06] heart that all our days on Earth we will
[1:50:11] never lost the need of a
[1:50:16] savior that need of God in our heart
[1:50:19] when never go away from
[1:50:22] us because if you lost that you are
[1:50:29] lost praise the
[1:50:31] Lord I believe that's what the Young
[1:50:33] Rich ruler was feeling in his
[1:50:35] heart he was successful and he had
[1:50:38] everything he knew the Lord and the
[1:50:40] Commandment but in his heart he was
[1:50:44] feeling the
[1:50:45] need the
[1:50:49] need
[1:50:55] praise the
[1:50:59] Lord and over a couple of months I just
[1:51:03] praying and just
[1:51:05] watching never tried to conform her to
[1:51:08] church or nothing I said Lord if it is
[1:51:10] you you you started doing the preaching
[1:51:13] you're going to do the convicting
[1:51:15] because pretty soon all we want just
[1:51:17] conform people to church and they don't
[1:51:19] have experience of
[1:51:24] God and because they are not conforming
[1:51:27] in the way that we think they should
[1:51:28] conform they are not Believers yet you
[1:51:31] don't you don't do the work of God in
[1:51:34] the heart of a
[1:51:44] mortar am on all of the things that
[1:51:47] Rejoice
[1:51:48] me serving the lord the
[1:51:50] Lord from
[1:51:53] this little
[1:51:55] Tabernacle I went home I cried I said
[1:52:00] God 5 years
[1:52:03] ago you show me this
[1:52:09] thing you show me this very
[1:52:15] thing and just to see you bringing it to
[1:52:19] pass
[1:52:29] praise the
[1:52:36] Lord let me try to preach let me try to
[1:52:39] say
[1:52:40] something that might encourage us this
[1:52:44] morning so just like I said I'm I'm just
[1:52:47] giving my report of uh of my trip maybe
[1:52:52] tonight if we if uh you know if we can
[1:52:54] find the the strength we might be able
[1:52:56] to preach I just give a report so I I
[1:52:58] speaking on this little subject that I
[1:53:01] entitled a throne in the
[1:53:03] manger now it actually came from a song
[1:53:06] I've heard uh uh uh years ago about
[1:53:11] shepher boy shepher boy and uh uh the
[1:53:15] song goes like this uh uh uh ought to
[1:53:20] see a Shepherd boy but God saw a king it
[1:53:23] was all about David when uh uh Samuel
[1:53:26] went to Jesse house you know everybody
[1:53:30] saw David as a Shepherd boy but God saw
[1:53:33] David as a king that's where that
[1:53:36] inspiration came from and uh uh a thrown
[1:53:40] in a Manger now as as we as we want to
[1:53:44] look at this let's go quickly to Matthew
[1:53:47] chapter 1 let's go to Matthew chapter 1
[1:53:49] one if I can be able I will if I can I
[1:53:53] have the rest of the entire year 2024 to
[1:53:57] preach it amen so I will introdu Matthew
[1:54:00] chapter 1 verse1 the generation of Jesus
[1:54:04] Christ the son of David the son of
[1:54:07] Abraham do you see anything wrong with
[1:54:09] that
[1:54:12] verse do you see anything wrong with
[1:54:17] it is the word of the Lord
[1:54:21] amen do you see anything wrong with
[1:54:27] it is what missing it's missing stuff
[1:54:31] it's missing the rest of those in the
[1:54:33] generation they're placing they're
[1:54:35] placing this wrong Abraham was before
[1:54:37] David right while we Matthew talk about
[1:54:40] the generation of Jesus Christ and put
[1:54:42] David before
[1:54:44] Abraham why because Matthew was
[1:54:46] targeting kingship okay there you go
[1:54:52] what he was targeting he was under the
[1:54:55] Holy Spirit the burden of the Holy
[1:54:57] Spirit to talk about
[1:55:01] kingship praise the Lord I hope I wake
[1:55:04] you up by
[1:55:05] that so he he was he was on the burden
[1:55:09] of the Holy Spirit he says the
[1:55:11] generation of Jesus Christ the son of
[1:55:13] David the son of Abraham then he came
[1:55:15] back and started from Abraham going down
[1:55:18] until he got to
[1:55:21] David are we together amen oh I feel
[1:55:25] like preaching are you ready for
[1:55:27] preaching
[1:55:33] amen oh praise the Lord oh praise the
[1:55:37] Lord now so you will realize that in the
[1:55:40] four Gospel Matthew is the only one that
[1:55:43] recorded the visit of the wise
[1:55:48] men Luke did not record
[1:55:52] it uh uh Mark did not record it neither
[1:55:56] John recorded it Matthew is the only one
[1:56:00] that recorded and you will find
[1:56:01] something that is common in the Book of
[1:56:03] Matthew he speaks of the kingdom of God
[1:56:06] and the kingdom of God and the kingdom
[1:56:08] of God because he was under a burden of
[1:56:12] the Holy Spirit to talk about
[1:56:17] kingship are we together
[1:56:21] amen praise the
[1:56:25] Lord oh am I having your your is your
[1:56:29] wheel spinning now you you trying to put
[1:56:31] yourself together or what amen I'm still
[1:56:34] I'm still trying to get a hold of you
[1:56:35] I'm trying to grab you amen I'm not I'm
[1:56:37] not really connect here with you amen
[1:56:40] and I think you you you still scattered
[1:56:44] yet but we will see here that as Matthew
[1:56:48] talks about kingship he comes down here
[1:56:52] Abraham be Isaac and Isaac be Jacob and
[1:56:56] Jacob be Judah and his
[1:57:00] Brethren and Judah beget phah and Zarah
[1:57:04] and we we have deal with that we we we
[1:57:07] took a whole time to go through the two
[1:57:09] sons of of Judah by Tamma which is ferah
[1:57:13] and and and Zara we we deare with that
[1:57:15] and I I don't know if you remember
[1:57:17] praise the Lord if you don't remember I
[1:57:19] and preach it again amen praise the Lord
[1:57:22] so if you don't remember just come to me
[1:57:24] remind me say brother one I don't
[1:57:26] remember I will preach it again now so
[1:57:29] but what what we want to establish here
[1:57:32] if we are looking in kingship we will
[1:57:34] want to establish that the scepter was
[1:57:38] given to
[1:57:40] Judah Judah was the one on the prophecy
[1:57:44] that Jacob prophesied and said the seror
[1:57:48] will not leave the home of Judah and the
[1:57:51] Ser to represent the
[1:57:55] kingship praise the Lord are we together
[1:58:00] are we together amen can the church say
[1:58:02] amen amen can the church say Amen can
[1:58:05] the church say amen
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:09] amen praise the
[1:58:11] Lord amen I'm still disconnected with
[1:58:15] you I don't know if it is my time Z but
[1:58:17] I'm still trying to catch up with you
[1:58:19] praise the Lord the scepter was promised
[1:58:21] to Judah but there was something that
[1:58:24] happened in the lineage of Judah that we
[1:58:27] want to visit because if Judah was
[1:58:29] promised that through his landship would
[1:58:32] come the
[1:58:33] king that God was going to achieve
[1:58:37] having the kingship through the lineage
[1:58:40] of Judah we realize that when you look
[1:58:42] through the lineage of Judah Judah never
[1:58:46] actually had a son of character her that
[1:58:49] will be able to uh H H rise up to that
[1:58:53] place to fulfill it but now he will have
[1:58:57] two sons by this woman called TMA which
[1:59:01] actually was his own
[1:59:05] daughter-in-law are we together are we
[1:59:08] together praise the Lord
[1:59:12] amen
[1:59:15] hallelujah now so we know the story how
[1:59:19] AMA wanting to have a child she wanted
[1:59:23] to be included in the blessings of Judah
[1:59:26] and his Prosper his Prosperity now so
[1:59:31] she went and this gu herself sat down
[1:59:34] there like a hot and and and and uh uh H
[1:59:38] Judah came by and saw this young woman
[1:59:41] when and and and you know and and and
[1:59:43] slept with Tamor now uh uh uh uh uh when
[1:59:47] Judah asked what should I give you she
[1:59:49] asked for something that Judah never had
[1:59:51] give me the kid he didn't not had it he
[1:59:53] said okay she said okay give me your
[1:59:56] staff and your
[1:59:58] bracelets she took things that could be
[2:00:02] identified only to
[2:00:06] him praise the Lord things that were
[2:00:09] very unique only to
[2:00:13] Judah and the Bible says she disappeared
[2:00:16] Judah came back she was not there he
[2:00:18] said well forget about it all of these
[2:00:21] young people they are all foolish and I
[2:00:23] just forget about it I I'll get a new
[2:00:24] one and all of that after a couple of
[2:00:26] months it's recorded that H H terman is
[2:00:30] pregnant Judah was sto he he commanded
[2:00:33] that terman should be brought before uh
[2:00:36] the congregation according to the Lord
[2:00:38] of God Tera was going to be
[2:00:43] Stone she was going to be stoned to
[2:00:45] death because uh h h h i mean she she
[2:00:49] had she had Liv unfaithful to her vow
[2:00:52] she she has gone out to become a
[2:00:56] hot praise the Lord no doubt in my mind
[2:01:00] I mean when they when they when and God
[2:01:02] tell me that morning I mean those guys
[2:01:04] they were very rude to her you know what
[2:01:07] they were pushing her and and and dring
[2:01:09] her she just make sure that she had her
[2:01:13] evidence amen praise the
[2:01:15] Lord hallelujah amen you know the story
[2:01:20] already and when it got there
[2:01:23] and and TMA was asked to
[2:01:27] speak from in her Bo on she took out her
[2:01:30] evidence and she said to the man that
[2:01:32] have these
[2:01:34] things is the one that I'm having this
[2:01:37] child
[2:01:39] for praise the Lord and when Judah look
[2:01:43] at the bracelet he could see his name
[2:01:44] speding there
[2:01:47] Judah praise the Lord
[2:01:50] he had his initial on the
[2:01:53] staff JJ Judah
[2:02:00] Jacob praise the Lord amen amen when he
[2:02:03] saw his eyes almost fell out of the
[2:02:08] socket her eyes came
[2:02:12] out everywhere was
[2:02:16] quiet because in the morning when Judah
[2:02:18] was told he was
[2:02:19] enraged how could tell I do this I'm
[2:02:22] going to kill
[2:02:24] her but when he saw his
[2:02:27] initi her eyes almost came out of the
[2:02:35] socket praise the Lord
[2:02:40] amen Judah was talking in bed now he's
[2:02:43] in
[2:02:47] Soprano she's more righteous than
[2:02:54] me she's more
[2:03:02] righteous praise the
[2:03:10] Lord but we realize there the promise of
[2:03:14] a
[2:03:15] kingship was given to this man Judah
[2:03:19] and now we will see
[2:03:22] that with all of his sons that he had
[2:03:26] none of them have
[2:03:28] left he was only waiting for the last
[2:03:31] one that was young but now here he have
[2:03:34] had
[2:03:36] Tam if you remember when we spoke on
[2:03:39] ferah her names means to Break Forth to
[2:03:45] overcome why because he struggled in uh
[2:03:49] in uh uh H H his mother's
[2:03:54] womb Zarah put his hands out the male
[2:03:57] wife put a red thread around his hand
[2:04:00] because they were expecting he will be
[2:04:02] the first one to come forth but
[2:04:05] surprisingly ferah Break Forth so they
[2:04:08] call him ferah meaning Break Forth how
[2:04:11] did you do it it means
[2:04:15] overcome that what his name means
[2:04:19] praise the
[2:04:21] Lord
[2:04:25] so we're talking about kingship keep
[2:04:28] that in the back of your mind we want to
[2:04:30] find this Throne that is in the
[2:04:33] manger now we see
[2:04:38] here that
[2:04:45] uh when we get back to the history of
[2:04:57] Israel praise the Lord amen praise the
[2:05:01] Lord I'm I'm I'm trying to just I'm just
[2:05:04] trying to you know just keep this thing
[2:05:07] together so we will
[2:05:09] not we will not
[2:05:13] uh let's go to the book of Deuteronomy
[2:05:17] quickly chapter 22 if I'm
[2:05:28] right chapter 22 if I'm right are we
[2:05:32] together
[2:05:43] amen oh
[2:05:46] Father what a wonderful
[2:05:49] what a wonderful savior you
[2:05:54] are
[2:05:57] amen no chapter 23 not 22 23
[2:06:01] verse2 now this is right in the
[2:06:04] Commandments of the Lord this is Moses
[2:06:06] speaking Moses here instructing the
[2:06:09] children of Israel in in verse two he
[2:06:13] says a bastor shall not enter into the
[2:06:17] congregation of the Lord even to his tth
[2:06:20] 10th Generation shall he not enter into
[2:06:23] the congregation of the Lord then he
[2:06:25] goes down and talk about the children of
[2:06:26] IM and Moab now in the in the in the
[2:06:30] scriptural sense the way a bastor is
[2:06:35] considered in the in the Jewish sense in
[2:06:38] under the Torah is different from the
[2:06:40] way that we think a bastard is a Bast in
[2:06:44] in our sense is maybe a child that grow
[2:06:46] up and did not know their father okay
[2:06:49] sometimes that's that's generally what
[2:06:51] that is not how the Bible you know all
[2:06:55] the under the Torah bastor was
[2:06:57] considered is almost like adoption
[2:07:00] adoption in our sense is when a a parent
[2:07:05] need a child and they go down to the
[2:07:07] home Affairs and you know they go
[2:07:09] through all the process and then they
[2:07:11] they take this child and and bring that
[2:07:13] child home that's our sense of adoption
[2:07:16] that's not God's sense of adoption the
[2:07:18] Bible sense of adoption is that a man
[2:07:22] adopt his own child the child that have
[2:07:25] taken interest in the father's
[2:07:28] inheritance so when the child is born
[2:07:31] the child is dead and uh uh he's a child
[2:07:34] he's he's my child he's my son and and
[2:07:37] as he grows up the father observe him
[2:07:40] from
[2:07:42] Far amen the father even gave him over
[2:07:46] to a
[2:07:47] tutor
[2:07:49] and tell the teure to give me report
[2:07:51] about that boy I want to see if I can
[2:07:54] trust him with my
[2:07:55] inheritance that's the Bible
[2:07:58] says God adopt his own children God do
[2:08:01] not adopt Satan children you were never
[2:08:04] Satan's Children you will never be
[2:08:05] Satan's Children you being born in sin
[2:08:08] does not make you a child of the
[2:08:12] devil
[2:08:14] God are we together amen praise the Lord
[2:08:19] amen is that is that somebody struggling
[2:08:22] with
[2:08:23] that is there somebody that's I believe
[2:08:25] they are a child of the
[2:08:30] devil now so so the Bible says of a Bast
[2:08:35] child is a child that was
[2:08:39] born not by The Commandments of the Lord
[2:08:42] the child that was born out of holy
[2:08:45] wellock either a child that was born in
[2:08:48] say so what what the reason why I'm
[2:08:51] saying this is because the way Judah had
[2:08:55] his tribe byma that child will be a
[2:08:58] bastard child because Tamma was not his
[2:09:02] wife Tamma was his daughter in law now
[2:09:06] so if Judah was promised the scepter the
[2:09:10] scepter will not come through that child
[2:09:13] if the scepter will ever comes through
[2:09:15] that child by The Commandments of the
[2:09:17] Lord it has to be after 10 generation
[2:09:20] right
[2:09:22] right are we together now you see the
[2:09:25] thing that we must
[2:09:28] understand bride of Jesus Christ people
[2:09:32] that the Covenant of God has come to in
[2:09:34] this age those things were not just a
[2:09:37] commandment God placed those things in
[2:09:40] his word as a
[2:09:44] prophecy praise the Lord because through
[2:09:47] Jesus Christ Christ through our Lord
[2:09:50] Jesus Christ we will realize this
[2:09:53] morning that God broke the curse prise
[2:09:57] God so I can never look at the way I was
[2:10:00] born or for you to look at the way that
[2:10:02] you were born and attribute that to
[2:10:06] yourself no God was targeting something
[2:10:10] by prophecy let's go to the Book of Ruth
[2:10:12] I have to hurry up here because I don't
[2:10:14] have time
[2:10:17] amen
[2:10:21] are we
[2:10:23] together are we together amen can the
[2:10:26] church say Amen am I I have to become
[2:10:28] like a medalist preacher now and be
[2:10:29] beging for amen can the church say amen
[2:10:32] amen or maybe a Baptist
[2:10:35] preacher I have to ask my brother Larry
[2:10:37] to teach me how to dread for those
[2:10:44] things are we together Ruth chapter 4
[2:10:50] Ruth chapter 4 you love the Lord amen
[2:10:54] he's been so good to
[2:10:56] us he's been so so so good to us praise
[2:11:00] the Lord the Lord has been so so so good
[2:11:04] to us ruths chapter 4 if we will just
[2:11:07] turn there there should be a review to
[2:11:10] some of you and
[2:11:13] uh uh because we we went through this
[2:11:16] thing but there's something I want to
[2:11:18] show
[2:11:19] you now if you look in Ruth chapter 4 we
[2:11:22] see here that uh that uh uh Ruth holds
[2:11:26] this story of redemption uh uh uh a
[2:11:29] moabit woman now that in that Genesis
[2:11:32] Deuteronomy chapter 23 we read the next
[2:11:35] verse talks about AML and Moab how you
[2:11:37] know the Lord told uh uh through Moses
[2:11:40] about the children of and and and Ruth
[2:11:42] is a daughter of a moabit and here say
[2:11:45] she's coming right into this uh this
[2:11:48] whole story is just so beautiful it's
[2:11:52] it's so beautiful are we together amen
[2:11:54] amen now when you look over here in the
[2:11:57] Book of Ruth chapter 4 it close it close
[2:11:59] out here with uh geneology or a
[2:12:03] generation that is in verse
[2:12:08] 18 that is in verse 18 let's look to
[2:12:11] verse 17 and the women her neighbor now
[2:12:15] me neighbor gave it a Chim I mean give
[2:12:19] it a name sorry the women gave a name to
[2:12:22] the
[2:12:23] baby uh a name to now me and they
[2:12:28] call okay I need to put my brain
[2:12:31] together slow
[2:12:33] down let read again verse 17 and the
[2:12:36] women her neighbors gave it a name
[2:12:39] saying there is a son born to now me and
[2:12:43] they call his name Obed he is the father
[2:12:48] of
[2:12:49] Jesse the father of David once
[2:12:54] again what's wrong with this
[2:12:57] picture this whole even is happening now
[2:13:00] you have to know this is the time of the
[2:13:03] judges this whole even is happening even
[2:13:06] before David was born so right
[2:13:11] here there is a prophecy that is playing
[2:13:16] out are we together
[2:13:19] generation even before David was
[2:13:25] born that is the reason
[2:13:28] why when God God interested in you it
[2:13:33] was not the day you came to
[2:13:35] church he started watching over you four
[2:13:38] generation before you were even
[2:13:42] born God four generation back before you
[2:13:47] were were even
[2:13:51] born that's the reason why nothing could
[2:13:54] have happened to your great great
[2:13:56] grandfa and mother and to your great
[2:13:59] great because because God single out he
[2:14:04] narrowed down that predestinated sea
[2:14:06] that was coming through that
[2:14:12] bloodline are we
[2:14:14] together if you think that we are only
[2:14:17] year to play Church you miss a big
[2:14:20] time amen you miss a big time and if you
[2:14:24] are you I mean you are you are I mean
[2:14:25] you are setting things up and playing
[2:14:28] things in your mind at this set time I'm
[2:14:30] going to you are just only stacking up
[2:14:32] regret for yourself because the day God
[2:14:35] really start dealing with you you're
[2:14:37] going to regret every
[2:14:42] meaning you never serve the
[2:14:46] Lord
[2:14:50] let's go down here
[2:14:54] quickly are we together
[2:14:57] amen so they call him over there the
[2:14:59] father of Jesse the father of David now
[2:15:02] now these are the generation of feras
[2:15:06] ferah is the son of Judah why is his
[2:15:09] generation doing
[2:15:12] here why is his generation doing here
[2:15:15] let's go on the generation of pharah sah
[2:15:18] be begot uh uh uh uh uh HRA and and and
[2:15:24] then you just go down read the rest of
[2:15:25] that the last verse and Obel be Jesse
[2:15:28] and Jesse be David now what I want you
[2:15:30] to do is that from pharah onto David
[2:15:34] 10th Generation that's what I wanted to
[2:15:37] establish because phah was born under
[2:15:40] the condition of a basor time and if the
[2:15:44] septer was promised to to to JW there we
[2:15:48] will not have a king until after 10
[2:15:51] generation
[2:15:52] right because that's the Lord of
[2:15:56] God are we together are you seeing the
[2:16:01] picture or do I need to slow
[2:16:03] down should I repeat
[2:16:06] myself
[2:16:09] amen because uh we're trying to get us
[2:16:11] something I'm not just here to entertain
[2:16:14] you I want you to understand it because
[2:16:16] it's concerning you if you don't
[2:16:18] understand these things the devil will
[2:16:20] keep knocking your head against the
[2:16:22] world and condemning you for every
[2:16:24] foolish things every stupid thing we do
[2:16:26] in our life you will never gain the
[2:16:28] victory to be able to stand up like a
[2:16:30] Son of God or like a daughter of
[2:16:33] God because all you know about yourself
[2:16:37] is just this thinking flesh that's all
[2:16:39] you know about yourself you really don't
[2:16:42] know the real you that is that seed that
[2:16:45] is in
[2:16:46] you
[2:16:57] are we together
[2:16:59] amen now so if you read this generation
[2:17:04] if you want you can count it have
[2:17:06] anybody counted
[2:17:07] it anyone counted it is it 10th yep so
[2:17:12] David came out as the 10th
[2:17:14] Generation wow so you see David coming
[2:17:17] as a king
[2:17:18] was not by mistake it was by
[2:17:24] prophecy it was not by mistake it was by
[2:17:30] prophecy and you being here is not by
[2:17:33] mistake is by prophecy because a prophet
[2:17:37] has spoken that there will be a bride
[2:17:39] there will be a little group that will
[2:17:42] grab this Revelation that's what I say
[2:17:44] you are under a
[2:17:46] prophecy
[2:17:54] are we
[2:18:02] together praise the Lord so when Israel
[2:18:06] now what brother brandham taught us in
[2:18:08] rejected King we all sometimes wrong
[2:18:12] with the thought that Israel was never
[2:18:13] to have a king no if Israel was never to
[2:18:17] have a king
[2:18:18] Jacob will not prophesied about the
[2:18:20] scepter in Judah if you read the book of
[2:18:23] Deuteronomy God even instructed Israel
[2:18:27] how a king should
[2:18:29] be that a king should never have many
[2:18:31] wives so Solomon could not fulfill that
[2:18:34] need of David a king should not should
[2:18:36] not build himself many chariots and and
[2:18:39] and God gave all of those instruction of
[2:18:42] how a king should be because God had a
[2:18:46] desire that there there was going to be
[2:18:48] a
[2:18:49] king are we
[2:18:52] together that his kingship will have
[2:18:55] been experience you have to realize that
[2:18:58] everything that God ever T about and
[2:19:01] desire in his mind he wanted to express
[2:19:04] it in
[2:19:10] flesh so he had to make a people he had
[2:19:13] to call a
[2:19:14] people to be able to bring them to the
[2:19:17] our
[2:19:20] place are we together
[2:19:26] am
[2:19:32] amen am I making you tired
[2:19:37] okay praise the
[2:19:44] Lord the sooner you tell me to stop the
[2:19:47] better it's it is for me
[2:19:49] even are we together amen so you see
[2:19:53] that the time that Israel started
[2:19:55] expressing to have a king it was not the
[2:19:58] it was not the the the fullness of time
[2:20:01] because uh David was was not even born
[2:20:03] yet
[2:20:05] right because before David would be
[2:20:08] anointed king he was he was just a
[2:20:10] little
[2:20:11] boy amen so look at the years of how
[2:20:15] long that saw ru over Israel before
[2:20:18] David was anointed
[2:20:20] king or maybe David was just a child at
[2:20:23] the time just a
[2:20:28] baby praise the
[2:20:30] Lord so what brother Brandon would teach
[2:20:33] us in rejected King is the people
[2:20:36] rejected the kingship of the word in the
[2:20:40] prophet
[2:20:43] Samuel amen they rejected the word they
[2:20:48] rejected Samuel as a prophet they wanted
[2:20:51] to be like other
[2:20:55] nations are we together so when David
[2:20:59] came on the scene we got to get through
[2:21:01] this thing people we got to get through
[2:21:03] this thing are we together
[2:21:07] Hallelujah when David came on the scene
[2:21:10] and and and and you just sing about it
[2:21:12] he was just a little boy and then Samuel
[2:21:14] went over there to the house of Jesse
[2:21:16] how all the son of Jesse line up and
[2:21:18] none of them he touched this one no the
[2:21:20] Lord said no it's not this one touched
[2:21:22] this one no the Lord said no until he
[2:21:25] says he says I mean Samuel was convinced
[2:21:27] that the the vision of the Lord was
[2:21:30] right and said Jesse do you have another
[2:21:34] son he said oh yeah it's just the last
[2:21:39] one he's a Shepherd board he's out there
[2:21:43] praise the
[2:21:44] Lord saw him as a Shepherd boy
[2:21:48] but when God looked down from
[2:21:50] heaven he says that's the man after my
[2:21:54] own
[2:21:55] heart praise the Lord that's the man
[2:21:58] that would break the
[2:22:00] curse that's the
[2:22:03] man that comes after the 10th
[2:22:09] Generation are we
[2:22:11] together and we know the
[2:22:15] story David was anointed
[2:22:19] king and he didn't even know it praise
[2:22:22] the
[2:22:23] Lord I just like a little lad he came
[2:22:26] before Samuel standing right there
[2:22:28] looking at all his brothers looking at
[2:22:30] him playing with rocks in his
[2:22:33] hands all David was interested in is how
[2:22:36] to switch that thing and get away with
[2:22:38] the birds and get and that's all he was
[2:22:40] interested in even after Samuel anointed
[2:22:43] him he just kept running back to the
[2:22:46] feet
[2:22:47] when Samuel anointed he did I'm I'm the
[2:22:51] king he didn't had an
[2:22:55] idea praise the Lord he ran back to the
[2:22:58] field take care of the sheeps and he
[2:23:00] just he just live his
[2:23:02] life but he was under a
[2:23:05] prophecy he was under an anointed word
[2:23:08] of a prophet that could never fail
[2:23:14] hallelujah praise the Lord you see that
[2:23:18] is the reason why when he got in there
[2:23:20] and he heard the voice of of of
[2:23:24] Goliath it was that
[2:23:28] anointing that rose up in his
[2:23:31] heart praise the Lord that is the thing
[2:23:34] that makes you mad with the Devil is the
[2:23:37] anointing that you are
[2:23:39] under and that's the reason why I say
[2:23:41] until this Vision impact your
[2:23:45] life amen
[2:23:51] praise the
[2:23:52] Lord when it impacts your life you will
[2:23:56] say enough is
[2:23:59] enough praise the Lord that's what David
[2:24:03] said enough is
[2:24:04] enough how can I allow that
[2:24:07] uncircumcised Philistines all of those
[2:24:09] things you were saying he never learned
[2:24:11] in The Message
[2:24:16] Church praise the Lord he was speaking
[2:24:19] out of inspiration because of the
[2:24:21] anointing that was upon his life
[2:24:27] prise praise the Lord that is the same
[2:24:30] thing that happened to you a young
[2:24:32] children when you tell your friends at
[2:24:34] school and says no no I can I can't do
[2:24:36] that I don't believe in
[2:24:38] it praise the
[2:24:40] lord it's the anointing of the word that
[2:24:42] is having influence on your
[2:24:45] life when you tell let them no no I can
[2:24:48] I don't I don't want to do it I I don't
[2:24:49] want to do
[2:24:52] it but we can bring you to church 6 o00
[2:24:55] in the morning and keep you to church
[2:24:57] until in the
[2:24:58] night if that word has not affected your
[2:25:01] young heart you will be carried away
[2:25:04] with every influence in school you will
[2:25:07] join all the all the ugly groups you
[2:25:09] will want to do all the foolish things
[2:25:11] that other friends are
[2:25:15] doing and yet you will have no no
[2:25:17] problem picking up your jacket to come
[2:25:21] to church on
[2:25:25] Sunday are we
[2:25:28] together now so we see the picture we
[2:25:31] are after the 10th
[2:25:33] Generation God gave
[2:25:36] David a
[2:25:38] promise he gave David a
[2:25:42] promise and the promise that he gave
[2:25:45] David is that
[2:25:47] dead there will always be a seed of
[2:25:50] David on the
[2:25:53] throne are we together there will always
[2:25:57] be a seed of
[2:25:59] David on the throne and it was an
[2:26:03] everlasting
[2:26:04] promise so the Jews have always
[2:26:08] believed that the a son of David will be
[2:26:12] on the throne even to the millenum we
[2:26:14] realize that uh H uh uh uh David took
[2:26:18] the throne to Solomon Solomon to ream on
[2:26:22] ream the the kingdom split
[2:26:25] it 10 tribes to jerob two tribes left
[2:26:30] with ream
[2:26:32] amen and God still reconfirmed his
[2:26:36] promise that he was not going to take
[2:26:38] the throne that will always be a seed of
[2:26:40] David he says when your son do evil I
[2:26:43] will punish them but I will always raise
[2:26:45] up one
[2:26:48] amen praise the Lord I might not get

[2:33:19] provision to
[2:33:21] continue the kingship of David to
[2:33:25] continue on the throne of
[2:33:29] David because with this Blood curse
[2:33:33] there is no natural man that could be
[2:33:36] born that will ever be
[2:33:40] qualified to take the throne God cursed
[2:33:43] the

[2:34:22] said the
[2:34:24] woman we have a seed I we gave the woman
[2:34:28] a
[2:34:30] seed why did God make that promise
[2:34:33] because he was bypassing the the cursed
[2:34:37] bloodline because he knew every seed
[2:34:40] that the woman will get from the man
[2:34:42] will be
[2:34:45] cursed
[2:34:47] hallelujah praise the

[2:35:24] was in your
[2:35:28] bloodline the promise of the Virgin

[2:36:01] papa it will have to come through the
[2:36:05] sea

[2:36:38] virgin shall
[2:36:43] conceive in the book of Isaiah it said a
[2:36:46] virgin shall conceive that's not a right
[2:36:49] translation because Matthew corrected
[2:36:53] it that word is there because of
[2:36:56] translation error it's not a virgin it's
[2:36:59] the Virgin God was precise he was not
[2:37:03] guessing in Genesis 3 he says their
[2:37:06] woman seed right will bruise the head of
[2:37:10] the SE not a woman seat no their woman
[2:37:14] seat
[2:37:17] God was precise he were not guessing
[2:37:21] maybe it is this maybe it is that a
[2:37:23] virgin maybe maybe no it was their
[2:37:26] virgin shall

[2:37:42] service it says man you you preach this
[2:37:44] thing better in South Africa than you're

[2:38:26] David there is no longer a natural
[2:38:29] man will ever Rise Up from the family of
[2:38:33] David to become a
[2:38:36] king God is
[2:38:40] bypassing David natural
[2:38:44] bloodline praise the
[2:38:47] Lord
[2:38:51] amen that's the same way he
[2:38:54] bass your natural
[2:39:01] bloodline he bass your natural
[2:39:05] bloodline to be able to get to your
[2:39:10] soul to be able to swow the seed
[2:39:13] Incorruptible in your soul
[2:39:16] it never came through your father not
[2:39:19] through your
[2:39:22] mother he has to bypass that natural
[2:39:29] tendency then we go back to the book of
[2:39:32] uh
[2:39:35] Matthew The Book of Luke will
[2:39:38] record when Jesus was
[2:39:42] born a
[2:39:44] very night to the the
[2:39:47] morning the Angels were watching the
[2:39:52] St that were on the
[2:39:56] Hills the Shepherds also on the field
[2:39:59] they realized that the heavens was
[2:40:04] beautiful and that same
[2:40:09] star that the that the the shepherd saw
[2:40:12] that the Angels Came and witnessed to
[2:40:14] the shepherd if it was the same star
[2:40:16] that the wise men
[2:40:20] saw but they were way down in
[2:40:24] Babylon they were seeing the same
[2:40:26] star that the Angels Came and witnessed
[2:40:31] to the
[2:40:32] shepher that Christ Our Lord is
[2:40:38] born go down to Bethlehem the the Angels
[2:40:42] were their
[2:40:44] GPS
[2:40:46] to lead them down to Beth him to that
[2:40:48] little
[2:40:51] manger can you think about it that the
[2:40:55] god of
[2:40:57] heaven was about to make his with
[2:41:03] us and none of our parents that were on
[2:41:06] that Earth that day had a place in their
[2:41:09] home for him to be
[2:41:14] born
[2:41:16] everybody was so busy about doing their
[2:41:22] taxes everybody was based about doing
[2:41:24] their
[2:41:27] taxes praise the
[2:41:32] Lord and this man and his wife told
[2:41:35] Joseph no sorry my my family just came
[2:41:39] in that the house is
[2:41:41] full CH said my wife she's about to give
[2:41:47] breath he says I have a St
[2:41:52] there praise the Lord everybody was so
[2:42:00] busy it was only the cows and the
[2:42:05] sheeps they hang their head over the
[2:42:08] fence and watch our Lord being
[2:42:14] born
[2:42:17] praise the Lord because he was born
[2:42:19] before even the Shepherds got
[2:42:24] there this man and his wife they are so
[2:42:27] nervous I've never done this
[2:42:31] before lady can you please help
[2:42:35] me praise the
[2:42:37] Lord but pretty soon the Shepherds will
[2:42:40] come into that very
[2:42:44] compound and and they were asked what is
[2:42:46] he that is born Christ Our
[2:42:50] Lord and the man and his wife
[2:42:54] what
[2:42:56] what the Angels told us that Christ Our
[2:43:01] Lord is
[2:43:04] born can you
[2:43:08] realize what M hit
[2:43:14] them and there were their regrets
[2:43:16] started from if we knew we would have
[2:43:20] given him our
[2:43:22] bedroom if we knew I I would have put
[2:43:24] the children out and giv them the
[2:43:26] children
[2:43:31] room and that's what happened if we
[2:43:34] don't recognize what God is doing now if
[2:43:37] you don't recognize what God is doing in
[2:43:40] your life now young people you will have
[2:43:43] a day to
[2:43:50] regret that those men will say the
[2:43:52] Angels the Angels sang to us on the hill
[2:43:56] about this
[2:44:03] child praise the
[2:44:06] Lord they saw a
[2:44:08] Manger but God saw a
[2:44:14] throne as far as God was
[2:44:17] concerned a son in the House of David
[2:44:20] was
[2:44:22] born the one to whom the Everlasting
[2:44:25] Throne of David is promise was
[2:44:32] born praise the
[2:44:36] Lord he never had a military salute
[2:44:40] neither an escort of
[2:44:43] army but that did that matter to God as
[2:44:47] far as God was
[2:44:48] concerned a king was
[2:44:52] born God praise the
[2:44:57] Lord
[2:45:00] amen I'm I I believe in my
[2:45:03] heart that that man and his
[2:45:06] wife changed their mind after the
[2:45:09] shepherd left I believe they tried to
[2:45:12] apologize they tried to reconcile with
[2:45:15] Joseph and his wife because you have to
[2:45:18] realize that Jesus Joseph and Mary stay
[2:45:21] in that time two
[2:45:23] years for the wise men to
[2:45:26] come I believe they tried to make a
[2:45:29] place nice for them and and give them a
[2:45:31] little place and say very we're very
[2:45:33] sorry we never knew this no I'm I'm I'm
[2:45:36] very very
[2:45:39] sorry and yet they will be there in
[2:45:43] their own Hometown in their own
[2:45:46] house they will find wise men coming
[2:45:48] from the East and saying where is he
[2:45:51] that is
[2:45:53] born King of the
[2:45:56] Jews praise the
[2:45:59] Lord when they were direct her to that
[2:46:03] house I believe the woman saying to her
[2:46:06] husband dear this was the very same
[2:46:08] thing that the shepherd
[2:46:11] said could that be the same the light
[2:46:15] that the shepherd saw that night when he
[2:46:17] came
[2:46:21] here praise the
[2:46:24] Lord do you know how powerful it is when
[2:46:28] Paul read the
[2:46:31] story that's what he
[2:46:34] said don't forsake to entertain
[2:46:38] strangers for somehow entertain Angels
[2:46:41] on the
[2:46:44] way praise the
[2:46:51] Lord when the wise man came it was not a
[2:46:56] palace maybe it was just a little hot in
[2:46:59] the village but it came announcing we
[2:47:02] have seen his star in the east two years
[2:47:05] we've been following this star and it
[2:47:08] hang over this
[2:47:10] house the king is in this house it was a
[2:47:13] little building it was not a nice place
[2:47:16] to
[2:47:18] be it did not have the Furnitures that
[2:47:20] we had in our
[2:47:22] home but yet when God looked down he saw
[2:47:26] a
[2:47:29] throne if God can make a throne in a
[2:47:33] stable if he can have a throne in a
[2:47:37] manger and have a throne in the little
[2:47:42] heart I believe God can have have a
[2:47:45] throne in this
[2:47:49] building this building is more nicer
[2:47:52] than the place Jesus was
[2:47:55] born but I also believe that God can
[2:47:59] have a throne in your
[2:48:04] heart praise the
[2:48:06] Lord because that's where the mercy seat
[2:48:10] is that's the place he's
[2:48:13] targeting
[2:48:17] if he can have a throne in a
[2:48:20] Manger where there are men of animal
[2:48:25] very
[2:48:27] stink all of you young people the way
[2:48:30] you like your shoes you never be able to
[2:48:33] walk in a
[2:48:36] stable you be holding your
[2:48:42] nose cuz you so care for your smelled
[2:48:45] and
[2:48:50] whatsoever but God saw a throne in a
[2:48:53] stinking
[2:48:55] place that's the reason why no matter
[2:48:58] what our life is what our past
[2:49:02] is he can make it
[2:49:08] true in your
[2:49:13] heart
[2:49:21] because the throne don't comes before
[2:49:23] the
[2:49:25] king it's a king that makes a
[2:49:31] throne you have to have a king before
[2:49:33] you have a
[2:49:36] throne and God can never make a throne
[2:49:38] in your heart until you make him the
[2:49:41] King of Kings and the Lord of Lord
[2:49:53] but that God will fulfill that promise
[2:49:55] to be able to bring that word to
[2:49:57] pass he had to
[2:50:00] byass the Natural
[2:50:03] bloodline of David God had to byass the
[2:50:11] curse and he did the same thing for you
[2:50:15] and
